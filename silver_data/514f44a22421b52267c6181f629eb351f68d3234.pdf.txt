A subset of mammalian nucleosomes 22 in situ ( inside cells ) resembles the canonical structure determined in vitro 25 years ago . 23 Nucleosome structure in situ is otherwise poorly understood . Using cryo - ET and 3 - D 24 classification analysis of yeast cells , here we find that canonical nucleosomes account 25 for less than 10 % of total nucleosomes expected in situ . In a strain in which H2A - GFP is 26 the sole source of histone H2A , class averages that resemble canonical nucleosomes 27 both with and without an extra density are found ex vivo , but not in situ . These data 28 suggest that the yeast intranuclear environment favors multiple non - canonical 29 nucleosome conformations . Using the structural observations here and the results of 30 previous genomics and biochemical studies , we propose a model in which the average 31 yeast nucleosome’s DNA is partially detached in situ . 32 33 Keywords 34 chromatin , nucleosome , yeast , GFP , cryo - ET , cryo - sectioning , cryo - FIB milling 35 36 37 3 INTRODUCTION 38 Eukaryotic chromosomes are polymers of DNA - protein complexes called nucleosomes . 39 An octamer of proteins , consisting of a heterotetramer of histones H3 and H4 and two 40 heterodimers of histones H2A and H2B , resides at the nucleosome’s center ( Luger et 41 al . , 1997 ) . Canonical nucleosomes resemble 10 nm wide , 6 nm thick cylinders and have 42 145 – 147 base pairs of DNA bent in 1 . 65 left - handed superhelical gyres around the 43 histone octamer ( Zhou et al . , 2019 ; Zlatanova et al . , 2009 ) . In contrast , non - canonical 44 nucleosomes have either partially detached DNA , partially detached histones , fewer 45 than 8 histones , or a combination of these features ( Zlatanova et al . , 2009 ) . Both X - ray 46 crystallography and single - particle cryo - EM have shown that reconstituted 47 nucleosomes , either alone or within a complex , are largely canonical in vitro ( Zhou et 48 al . , 2019 ) . Nucleosome structures in situ inside cells remain mysterious . 49 50 Molecular - resolution ( 2 – 4 nm ) studies of unique objects like cells may be obtained by 51 cryo - electron tomography ( cryo - ET ) , a form of cryo - electron microscopy ( cryo - EM ) that 52 generates 3 - D reconstructions called cryotomograms . These studies reveal life - like 53 snapshots of macromolecular complexes because the samples are prepared and then 54 imaged in an unfixed , unstained , frozen - hydrated state . Most eukaryotic cells are too 55 thick for cryo - ET , so thinner frozen - hydrated samples are made by cutting by 56 cryomicrotomy or thinning by cryo - focused ion beam ( cryo - FIB ) milling ( Ng and Gan , 57 2020 ; Strunk et al . , 2012 ) . These two approaches respectively produce cryosections 58 and plank - like samples called cryolamellae . Subvolumes called subtomograms contain 59 independent copies of the cells’ macromolecular complexes . These subtomograms can 60 4 be further studied by averaging , which increases the signal - to - noise ratio , and 61 classification , which facilitates the analysis of heterogeneity . Large macromolecular 62 complexes such as ribosomes and proteasomes have been identified in situ by 3 - D 63 classification followed by comparison of the class averages to known structures – an 64 approach called purification in silico ( Beck and Baumeister , 2016 ) . 65 66 Using the purification in silico approach , we previously showed that canonical 67 nucleosomes exist in cryotomograms of yeast cell lysates ex vivo and in a HeLa cell 68 cryolamella ( Cai et al . , 2018a ; Cai et al . , 2018b ; Cai et al . , 2018c ) . Herein , we use the 69 term ex vivo to describe nucleosomes from lysates instead of the term in vitro , which is 70 more commonly used to describe either reconstituted or purified mononucleosomes . 71 However , our 3 - D structural analysis did not generate canonical nucleosome structures 72 from cryosectioned fission yeast cells ( Cai et al . , 2018b ) . The discrepancy between 73 nucleosome class averages ex vivo and in situ could have either technical or biological 74 origins . As a biological explanation for the absence of canonical nucleosome class 75 averages in situ , we hypothesized that yeast nucleosomes are either conformationally 76 or constitutionally heterogeneous . 77 78 In this work , we test this heterogenous - nucleosome hypothesis by using cryo - ET to 79 image both wild - type cells and strains that have nucleosomes bearing GFP as a density 80 tag . We use the budding yeast S . cerevisiae , herein called yeast , because it has only 81 two copies of each histone gene and because it is more amenable to gene editing . Our 82 work compares the chromatin in both lysates and thin cellular cryo - EM samples 83 5 prepared using primarily cryo - FIB milling . To obtain more information about 84 nucleosomes in situ , we create one strain in which H2A - GFP is the sole source of H2A , 85 meaning that the nucleosomes are expected to project one or two extra densities from 86 their surface . Canonical nucleosomes are abundant in nuclear lysates and , in the H2A - 87 GFP - expressing strain lysates , have extra densities consistent with GFP . In contrast , 88 canonical nucleosomes account for less than 10 % of the expected number of total 89 nucleosomes in wild - type cell cryolamellae . Furthermore , neither canonical 90 nucleosomes nor nucleosome - like particles with extra protruding densities were 91 detected in the H2A - GFP - expressing strain . These findings suggest that the yeast 92 intracellular environment disfavors the canonical nucleosome conformation . 93 94 6 RESULTS 95 96 Canonical nucleosomes are abundant in wild - type lysates 97 The crystal structure of the reconstituted yeast nucleosome ( White et al . , 2001 ) shows a 98 canonical structure that is largely indistinguishable from the first published one ( Luger et 99 al . , 1997 ) . To describe the various views of the nucleosome , herein we use the compact 100 nomenclature introduced by ( Zhou et al . , 2019 ) : the disc view is along the superhelical 101 axis , and the gyre view is along the pseudo - dyad axis ( Figure 1A ) . The side view , which 102 was not defined by Zhou et al , is orthogonal to both the disc and gyre views . 103 104 The original RELION subtomogram - analysis workflow ( Bharat and Scheres , 2016 ) 105 involves 2 - D classification , followed by 3 - D classification ( Figure S1A ) , whereas in the 106 alternative approach , 2 - D classification is bypassed and subtomograms are subjected 107 directly to 3 - D classification ( Figure S1B ) ; for brevity , we term this alternative method 108 “direct 3 - D classification” . Direct 3 - D classification is limited by computer hardware 109 ( Kimanius et al . , 2016 ) , but can detect more canonical nucleosomes ( Cai et al . , 2018a ) ; 110 see the Methods for more details . In this study , the original workflow is used on a subset 111 of samples to show example 2 - D class averages for comparison with other studies . 112 However , the conclusions in this paper are drawn from direct 3 - D classification , which 113 detects more canonical nucleosomes . 114 115 Our previous subtomogram analysis of nuclear lysates ( Cai et al . , 2018c ) revealed that 116 nucleosomes from the wild - type strain YEF473A ( Bi and Pringle , 1996 ) adopt the 117 7 canonical structure ex vivo . We repeated this experiment on the strain BY4741 118 ( Brachmann et al . , 1998 ) , which serves as the wild - type and parent strain for the 119 histone - GFP tagging mutants described later . In this experiment , yeast nuclei are 120 isolated , lysed , then deposited on an EM grid . Cryotomograms of BY4741 nuclear 121 lysates reveal the crowded nucleosome - like particles and other cellular debris ( Figure 122 S2 ) . Next , we template matched for nucleosome - like particles using a nucleosome - 123 sized featureless cylinder as a reference . Direct 3 - D classification ( Figure S3 , A and B ) 124 followed by 3 - D refinement produced an 18 Å - resolution subtomogram average of a 125 BY4741 canonical nucleosome class ( Figure S3C ) . The subtomogram average of wild - 126 type yeast nucleosomes in nuclear lysates has longer linker DNA ( Figure 1B ) than the 127 crystal structure , which was reconstituted using a 146 - bp DNA fragment . 128 129 Canonical nucleosomes are rare in wild - type cells in situ 130 Cryo - FIB milling is a compression - free method to thin frozen - hydrated cells ( Hayles et 131 al . , 2007 ; Mahamid et al . , 2015 ; Marko et al . , 2006 ; Medeiros et al . , 2018 ; Rigort et al . , 132 2010 ; Villa et al . , 2013 ) . This technique uses a beam of gallium ions to thin a cell under 133 cryogenic conditions , producing a frozen - hydrated plank - like cellular sample called a 134 cryolamella . Canonical nucleosomes are detectable in a HeLa cell cryolamella ( Cai et 135 al . , 2018a ) , meaning that cryo - FIB milling does not grossly perturb canonical 136 nucleosomes in situ . We prepared cryolamellae of wild - type BY4741 cells . 137 Cryotomograms of yeast cryolamellae showed that nuclei were packed with 138 nucleosome - like particles ( Figure S4 ) . Two - dimensional class averages of template - 139 matched nucleosome - like particles reveal densities that have the approximate size and 140 8 shape of nucleosomes ( Figure S5A ) . We then subjected the particles belonging to the 141 most nucleosome - like 2 - D class averages to 3 - D classification , following the original 142 RELION classification workflow . However , none of these 3 - D class averages resemble 143 canonical nucleosomes ( Figure S5B ) . While many of the nucleosome - like class 144 averages have dimensions similar to the canonical nucleosome , none of them have 145 densities that resemble the distinctive 1 . 65 left - handed gyres of DNA . To rule out the 146 possibility that canonical nucleosomes were missed during 2 - D classification , we 147 performed direct 3 - D classification using 100 classes . None of the resultant 100 class 148 averages resemble a canonical nucleosome ( Figure S6 ) . 149 150 To determine if our template - matching and classification workflow missed the canonical 151 nucleosomes , we re - did both template matching and 3 - D classification of BY4741 wild - 152 type yeast cryolamellae with intentionally biased references . Instead of a featureless 153 cylinder , we used the yeast nucleosome crystal structure ( White et al . , 2001 ) as the 154 reference ( Figure S7A ) . If canonical nucleosomes are abundant in yeast , they should be 155 detected as a class average that resembles a low - resolution nucleosome crystal 156 structure . No canonical nucleosome class averages were seen in this control 157 experiment ( Figure S7B and C ) . 158 159 Our previous study of a HeLa cell ( Cai et al . , 2018a ) , which detected canonical 160 nucleosomes , used a Volta phase plate ( VPP ) . VPP data has more low - resolution 161 contrast than defocus phase - contrast data . To test if canonical nucleosomes in yeast 162 cryolamellae are detectable in VPP data , we recorded VPP tilt series and reconstructed 163 9 tomograms of BY4741 cell cryolamellae ( Figure S8 ) . Subtomogram analysis of the VPP 164 tomograms by 2 - D classification ( Figure S9A ) , followed by 3 - D classification did not 165 reveal a nucleosome class average in BY4741 ( Figure S9B ) . When we performed direct 166 3 - D classification using 100 classes , we detected one class average that resembles a 167 canonical nucleosome ( Figure S10A , Movie S1 ) . A second round of classification 168 revealed two types of class averages , one of which resembles a slightly elongated 169 nucleosome ( Figure S10B , Movie S2 ) . Refinement of these two types of nucleosomes 170 produced 24 Å - resolution averages that differ in the amount of linker DNA visible 171 ( Figures 1C and S10C ) . The class average that has more ordered linker DNA vaguely 172 resembles the chromatosome , a form of the nucleosome that has linker DNA crossing 173 at the entry - exit site and in contact with a linker histone ( Bednar et al . , 2017 ; Zhou et al . , 174 2015 ) . However , the DNA does not appear to cross at the DNA entry - exit site , and , at 175 the present resolution , it is not possible to determine if the linker histone is present . 176 Unlike plunge - frozen complexes , which interact with the air - water interface and have 177 biased orientations ( Noble et al . , 2018 ) , complexes in situ are not subject to such 178 biases . Visualization of the angular distribution of the canonical nucleosomes shows 179 that the disc views are undersampled and likely missed by the classification analysis 180 ( Figure S10D ) , which we also observed in our analysis of HeLa nucleosomes in situ 181 ( Cai et al . , 2018a ) . This missing hemisphere of views results in roughly half of the 182 canonical nucleosomes going undetected . In summary , the use of VPP and relatively 183 thin ( ≤ 160 nm ) cryolamellae made it possible to detect two canonical nucleosome 184 classes that differ in the amount of ordered linker DNA , similar to what we observed in a 185 HeLa cell ( Cai et al . , 2018a ) . 186 10 187 Following our previous work ( Cai et al . , 2018a ) , we performed a negative control by 188 analyzing a tomogram of a region in the cytoplasm ( Figure S11 ) , which does not have 189 any nucleosomes . We performed template matching using the same reference as for 190 our analysis of nuclei and then direct 3 - D classification into 100 classes . None of the 191 resultant class averages resemble a canonical nucleosome ( Figure S12 ) , confirming 192 that our analysis was not biased by the cylindrical reference . 193 194 Our classification detected only 769 canonical nucleosomes . If we account for the 195 undersampling of disc views ( Figure S10D ) , we estimate there are ~ 1 , 500 canonical 196 nucleosomes detected in the 5 tomograms . In comparison , we estimate that in the 197 single HeLa cryolamella cryotomogram ( Cai et al . , 2018a ) , there were more than 2 , 000 198 nucleosomes in a nucleus volume ~ 1 / 6th of the total analyzed here in BY4741 . The 199 percentage of HeLa nucleosomes that are non - canonical in situ is unknown and will 200 require further study . To visualize the distribution of canonical nucleosomes , we 201 remapped the two class averages back into their positions in the original tomogram that 202 contains the largest number of canonical nucleosomes ( Figure 2 ) . The remapped model 203 shows that the canonical nucleosomes are scattered throughout the sampled nuclear 204 volume . There are no large clusters of canonical nucleosomes like what we saw near 205 the nuclear envelope of a HeLa cell . Using experimentally determined values for 206 nucleosome number and chromatin volume ( Oberbeckmann et al . , 2019 ; Uchida et al . , 207 2011 ) , the tomograms we analyzed are expected to hold 25 , 000 nucleosomes . 208 Therefore , the nucleosomes ( both canonical and non - canonical ) should pack with an 209 11 order - of - magnitude higher density than visualized in our remapped model ( Figure 2B ) . 210 In summary , our calculations suggest that the vast majority ( > 90 % ) of the nucleosomes 211 in BY4741 yeast are non - canonical . 212 213 Histone GFP - tagging strategy 214 Our previous cryo - ET analysis of nucleosomes in a HeLa cell revealed that 215 subtomogram 3 - D classification is sensitive to features much smaller than the 216 nucleosomes , as evidenced by the separation of canonical - nucleosome class averages 217 that differ by ~ 10 bp of linker DNA near the dyad ( Cai et al . , 2018a ) . Furthermore , 218 studies of flagella ( Oda and Kikkawa , 2013 ) and pilus machines ( Chang et al . , 2016 ) 219 showed that subtomogram averages of complexes in situ can reveal either the presence 220 or absence of protein densities as small as fluorescent proteins . These observations led 221 us to attempt to use the GFP tag to facilitate nucleosome identification in situ . Our 222 strategy is to compare subtomogram averages of nucleosome - like particles in strains 223 that express only wild - type histones versus those that express only GFP - tagged 224 histones . Note that this tagging strategy did not work as intended because we could not 225 detect tagged nucleosomes 3 - D classes in situ . However , this negative result provided 226 an important clue about the nature of nucleosomes inside yeast cells ( see below ) . 227 228 Histones can accept a genetically encoded GFP tag at either the N - or C - terminus . An 229 N - terminal GFP tag is not expected to be visible in subtomogram averages because it 230 would be separated from the histone’s globular domain by the long , flexible N - terminal 231 “tail” . Therefore , we chose to tag the histone C - terminus , which does not have a flexible 232 12 tail ( Figure S13 , A and B ) . To further confine the tag , we eliminated the peptide linker 233 that is included in popular GFP - tagging modules ( Figure S13C ) . S . cerevisiae contains 234 two copies of each histone ( Figure S13D ) , which are arranged as gene pairs . To 235 maximize our chances of detecting nucleosome class averages that have an extra 236 density , we sought to create strains in which a histone - GFP fusion is the sole source of 237 one class of histones ( Figure S13 , E and F ) . 238 239 In budding yeast , the H2A and H2B genes are arranged as gene pairs HTA1 - HTB1 and 240 HTA2 - HTB2 ( Hereford et al . , 1979 ) . We first deleted the entire HTA2 - HTB2 gene pair to 241 generate LGY0012 . This deletion prevents HTA2 - HTB2 , which is flanked by two 242 retrotransposon elements , from being amplified in circular DNA molecules ( Libuda and 243 Winston , 2006 ) . We then inserted the GFP gene at the 3’ end of HTA1 , without a linker , 244 to generate LGY0016 , making H2A - GFP the sole source of H2A . We confirmed 245 LGY0016’s genotype by PCR analysis ( Figure S14 , A and B ) and Sanger sequencing . 246 Immunoblots using anti - H2A or anti - GFP antibodies detected a single ~ 40 kilodalton 247 band , which is the expected size of the H2A - GFP fusion protein ( Figure S14C ) . 248 Accordingly , the LGY0016 nuclei showed bright fluorescence ( Figure S14D ) . We also 249 constructed a strain , LGY0015 , that expresses an H2B - GFP fusion without a linker 250 peptide ( Figure S14 , E – H ) . LGY0015 also has an untagged copy of H2B . We were 251 unable to create strains that have either H2B - GFP , H3 - GFP , or H4 - GFP as the sole 252 H2B , H3 , and H4 sources , respectively . Consistent with this low tolerance for a GFP - 253 tagged histone as the sole source of a histone type , the LGY0016 doubling time is 254 ~ 50 % longer than for wild - type BY4741 ( 130 minutes versus 85 minutes ) in rich media . 255 13 256 GFP is detectable on nucleosome subtomogram averages ex vivo 257 To determine if GFP tags are detectable on the nucleosome’s surface , we imaged the 258 nuclear lysates of LGY0016 and LGY0015 cells by cryo - ET ( Figures S15 and S16 ) . The 259 2 - D class averages of LGY0016 and LGY0015 nuclear lysates resemble those seen in 260 single - particle cryo - EM studies of reconstituted nucleosomes ( Chua et al . , 2016 ) , 261 though with lower - resolution features ( Figure 3A , S17A ) . Note that 2 - D classification 262 uses a circular mask , meaning that it will not bias the shape of the resultant class 263 averages to resemble , for example , the double - lined motifs seen in nucleosome side 264 and gyre views . To increase the number of detected nucleosomes , we used direct 3 - D 265 classification into 40 classes . We obtained canonical nucleosome 3 - D class averages 266 this way in the lysates of both strains ( Figure S18 and S19 ; Movies S3 and S4 ) . These 267 class averages have the unmistakable structural motifs of canonical nucleosomes , such 268 as a 10 - nm diameter , 6 - nm thick cylindrical shape , and the left - handed path of the DNA 269 densities . There is more DNA than the crystal structure’s 1 . 65 gyres because lysate 270 samples have linker DNA . All these properties are consistent with the subtomogram 271 analysis of nucleosomes from wild - type strains BY4741 ( Figure 1B ) and YEF473A ( Cai 272 et al . , 2018c ) . 273 274 Subsequent classification rounds revealed nucleosome class averages that had an 275 extra density projecting from one or both faces ( Figures S18B and S19B ) . One example 276 of each class ( zero , one , or two extra densities ) was refined to ~ 25 Å resolution ( Figure 277 3B , S17B ) . The position of the extra density is consistent with the location of the H2A C - 278 14 terminus being closer to the DNA entry - exit point ( Figure 3C ) and the H2B C - terminus 279 being far from the DNA entry - exit point ( Figure S17C ) . In principle , LGY0015 cells can 280 assemble nucleosomes that have two copies of H2B - GFP . The absence of LGY0015 281 nucleosome classes with two densities suggest that they are either unstable or too rare 282 to detect by 3 - D classification . We focused our in situ cryo - ET analysis on LGY0016 283 cells because the GFP tags are easier to recognize on nucleosomes from nuclear 284 lysates of this strain . 285 286 Canonical nucleosome classes are not detected in LGY0016 cells in situ 287 In an attempt to detect more yeast nucleosomes in situ , we did three types of imaging 288 experiments on LGY0016 cells . We performed cryo - ET of cryolamellae with and without 289 the VPP ( Figures S20 and S21 ) and we also imaged cryosections with the VPP ( Figure 290 S22 ) . The cryolamellae benefit from the absence of compression artifacts while the 291 cryosections benefit from being thinner on average . We performed template matching 292 and then subjected the hits directly to 3 - D classification , which was needed to detect 293 canonical nucleosomes in BY4741 above . The 3 - D class averages from all three 294 samples resembled neither canonical nucleosomes nor cylindrical bodies with one or 295 more protruding densities that is expected from the lysate samples ( Figures 4 , S23 , 296 S24 , Movie S5 ) . Some class averages have two linear motifs that resemble the double 297 DNA gyres opposite the DNA entry - exit point , but these DNA - like densities do not go 298 1 . 65 times around the center of mass as expected of canonical nucleosomes ( Luger et 299 al . , 1997 ) . Small variations in the classification parameters such as mask size , class 300 number did not reveal any canonical nucleosome classes in LGY0016 cell 301 15 cryotomograms . We therefore conclude that canonical nucleosomes are rare inside 302 budding yeast nuclei and that non - canonical nucleosomes are the vast majority . 303 304 Ribosome control for sample , data , and analysis pathologies 305 We may have missed canonical nucleosomes if there were pathologies with either our 306 lamellae , data , or workflow , which would result in grossly misclassified and misaligned 307 particles . To test this hypothesis , we performed template matching , 3 - D classification 308 and alignment on cytoplasmic ribosomes . Because ribosomes are so large ( > 3 309 megadaltons ) and have been studied extensively in situ , any of the pathologies listed 310 above would result in either the absence of ribosome class averages or extremely low 311 resolution . Using our control tomogram of the cytoplasm , which is densely packed with 312 ribosomes , we obtained a subtomogram average at between ~ 33 Å resolution based on 313 the Fourier shell correlation ( FSC ) = 0 . 5 cutoff criterion ( or 28 Å using the FSC = 0 . 143 314 criterion ) , from 1 , 150 particles ( Figure S25 ) . As a comparison , we simulated densities 315 with the yeast ribosome crystal structure between 15 Å and 30 Å resolution and found 316 that our average has density features consistent with this resolution range . The 317 resolutions of our nucleosome and ribosome averages ( ~ 24 Å and 33 Å ) are 318 comparable to recent in situ subtomogram averages using similar numbers of particles 319 ( ~ 500 to 1 , 500 ) ( Laughlin et al . , 2022 ; van den Hoek et al . , 2022 ) . Therefore , our 320 lamellae , data , and workflow do not show evidence of pathologies . 321 322 GFP tagging of H3 and H4 also does not reveal nucleosomes 323 In cryolamellae of LGY0016 cells , the absence of nucleosome - like class averages that 324 16 have an extra density bump suggested that previously unappreciated properties of the 325 H2A - H2B heterodimer make this histone pair a poor candidate for the GFP fusion tag 326 strategy ( see Discussion ) . We therefore revisited GFP tagging of H3 and H4 , which are 327 found in all known and speculated forms of nucleosomes and non - canonical 328 nucleosomes ( Zlatanova et al . , 2009 ) . Because all attempts to make H3 - or H4 - GFP 329 “sole source” strains failed , we tested strains that had one wild - type copy and one GFP - 330 tagged copy of one of these histones . We tagged members of the HHF1 - HHT1 gene 331 pair , which encode histone H4 ( HHF1 ) and H3 ( HHT1 ) . HHF1 - HHT1 is flanked by the 332 same transposon elements as HTA2 - HTB2 , so gene amplification here would not result 333 in the wild - type copy outnumbering the tagged copy . The genotypes and phenotypes 334 were validated by confirmation PCRs , western blots , and fluorescence confocal 335 microscopy ( Figures S26 and S27 ) . We created H3 - GFP strains without a linker 336 ( LGY0007 ) and with linker sequences RIPGLIN ( LGY0002 ) and GGSGGS ( LGY0070 ) ; 337 this latter linker was introduced previously ( Verzijlbergen et al . , 2010 ) . For H4 , we could 338 only obtain a strain with a H4 - GFP - expressing strain by using the flexible GGSGGS 339 linker ( LGY0071 ; Figure S27 ) . Flexible linkers are not expected to facilitate tag - based 340 identification because the tag can occupy a much larger volume and get blurred out as 341 a result but was the only one tolerated in our H4 tagging attempts . 342 343 We next prepared nuclear lysates of each of these strains , performed cryo - ET , and 344 subjected them to direct 3 - D classification analysis ( Figures S28 – S31 ) . Like the other 345 strains , the lysates of each of these four strains had large numbers of canonical 346 nucleosomes ( Figures S28A , S29A , S30A , S31A ) . Of the canonical nucleosomes , we 347 17 were only able to detect class averages that have the extra density in the LGY0007 348 lysates ( Figure S28 ) ; the nuclear lysates of the other strains do not have nucleosome 349 class averages with a GFP density . Finally , to test if nucleosomes , canonical or non - 350 canonical , with the GFP density bump , could be detected in situ , we performed cryo - ET 351 of LGY0007 cryolamellae with the VPP ( Figure S32 ) . We then performed template 352 matching and subjected the hits to direct 3 - D classification analysis . Compared to the 353 BY4741 ( wild type ) cell cryolamella VPP class averages ( Figure S10A ) , the 3 - D class 354 averages in LGY0007 cell cryolamellae resemble neither canonical nucleosomes nor 355 cylindrical bodies with a protruding density ( Figure S33 ) . Therefore , H3 - and H4 - GFP 356 fusions cannot be used to detect non - canonical nucleosomes and much more work 357 needs to be done to identify non - canonical nucleosomes . 358 18 DISCUSSION 359 Cryo - EM of cells has made the structural analysis of chromatin organization in situ 360 feasible . The earliest in situ studies were done with projection cryo - EM images and 2 - D 361 Fourier analysis of cryosectioned cells , which revealed that long - range order is absent 362 in chromatin in situ ( Eltsov et al . , 2008 ; McDowall et al . , 1986 ) . Cryo - ET studies later 363 showed that short - range order is present in isolated chicken erythrocyte nuclei ( Scheffer 364 et al . , 2011 ) , but absent in picoplankton and budding yeast ( Chen et al . , 2016 ; Gan et 365 al . , 2013 ) . These early cryo - ET studies revealed little about nucleosome structure in situ 366 because , as Eltsov et al observed , the nucleosomes in those samples appeared like 367 smooth ellipsoids ( Eltsov et al . , 2018 ) . Recent cryo - ET studies using state - of - the - art 368 electron - counting cameras and energy filters have revealed that in cryotomographic 369 slices of cell nuclei , there are densities that resemble nucleosome side and gyre views 370 in which gyre - like features are resolved ( Cai et al . , 2018a ; Cai et al . , 2018b ; Eltsov et 371 al . , 2018 ) . This higher - fidelity data made it possible to use 3 - D classification to detect 372 canonical nucleosomes in nuclear envelope - associated chromatin in a HeLa cell ( Cai et 373 al . , 2018a ) . 374 375 Our use of 3 - D classification detected canonical nucleosomes in wild - type yeast nuclear 376 lysates and canonical nucleosomes both with and without GFP tags in nuclear lysates 377 of some strains that bear histone - GFP fusions . We also detected a canonical 378 nucleosome class average in wild - type cell cryolamellae imaged with a VPP . The in situ 379 detections suggest that there are only ~ 1 , 500 canonical nucleosomes ( taking account of 380 the undersampling of nucleosomes in the disc view ) out of the 25 , 000 nucleosomes 381 19 expected of the total sampled nuclear volume . Note that the percentage of canonical 382 nucleosomes in lysates cannot be accurately estimated because we cannot determine 383 how many chromosomes’ worth of nucleosomes are in each field of view . The estimates 384 from the lamellae are more reliable because the expected numbers of nucleosomes 385 ( canonical or not ) can be estimated from genomics , biochemical , and X - ray tomography 386 data ( see Methods ) . When we analyzed LGY0016 cryolamellae , in which H2A - GFP is 387 the sole source of H2A , we did not detect canonical nucleosome classes or any 388 cylindrical nucleosome - sized structures that have extra density bumps . Likewise , 389 analysis of cryolamellae of LGY0007 did not reveal either a canonical nucleosome - like 390 class average or any cylindrical nucleosome - sized density with an extra density bump , 391 even though H3 - GFP should be incorporated into the H3 - H4 tetramer , the central 392 component of the nucleosome . 393 394 The absence of either a canonical nucleosome - like class average that has an extra 395 density bump , or a cylinder with an extra density bump in the LGY0016 strain suggests 396 that the H2A - H2B heterodimer is mobile in situ . By “mobility” , we are not implying that 397 H2A - H2B is dissociated . The H2A / H2B dimers are in contact with the H3 / H4 398 heterotetramer because crosslinking and single - particle fluorescence imaging 399 experiments showed that approximately 80 % of H2B – and presumably H2A to which it 400 stably dimerizes – is bound to chromatin in situ ( Mohan et al . , 2018 ; Ranjan et al . , 401 2020 ) . H2A - H2B mobility was hinted at by the observations from X - ray crystallography 402 that yeast nucleosomes lack the hydrogen bonds that stabilize the two H2A - H2B 403 heterodimers in metazoan nucleosomes ( White et al . , 2001 ) and that interfaces 404 20 between H2A - H2B and H3 are moderately exposed to small - molecule probes ( Marr et 405 al . , 2021 ) . Furthermore , recent simulations show that the H2A / H2B heterodimer may 406 adopt numerous orientations and small displacements , with either fully or partially 407 unwrapped DNA , while remaining in contact with H3 - H4 ( Ishida and Kono , 2022 ) . We 408 also cannot rule out the possibility that expression of H2A - GFP nucleosome structure is 409 less ordered in situ . 410 411 Like LGY0016 ( H2A - GFP sole source ) , none of the LGY0007 ( H3 plus H3 - GFP ) 412 nucleosome - like class averages had an extra density consistent with the GFP density 413 tag , unlike the lysates . Furthermore , there were no canonical nucleosome class 414 averages – either without or with the GFP density – seen among the class averages of 415 LGY0007 lamella nucleosome - like particles . These observations suggest that the 416 expression of H3 - GFP makes nucleosomes less ordered in situ . Altogether , our 417 experiments show that in budding yeast , canonical nucleosomes are rare in situ and 418 that the expression of GFP - tagged histones leads to further perturbations of 419 nucleosome structure in situ . 420 421 Our data is consistent with a model in which yeast canonical nucleosomes are abundant 422 ex vivo ( Figure 5A ) . They adopt multiple non - canonical conformations in situ ( Figure 5 , 423 B and C ) and rarely adopt the canonical one ( Figure 5D ) . Note that the blurring in these 424 panels implies the heterogeneity in the positions of the DNA and proteins , not their 425 actual motion . In addition to H2A - H2B and DNA conformational heterogeneity , diverse 426 nucleosome - associated proteins that bind to multiple positions ( Figure 5C ) would further 427 21 increase the heterogeneity ; in this figure , the blurring implies constitutional 428 heterogeneity , not motion . A high abundance of non - canonical nucleosomes means that 429 more of the genome would be accessible , consistent with yeast having high levels of 430 transcription . Nucleosome heterogeneity is also consistent with the absence of 431 chromatin long - range order in situ because crystalline oligonucleosome arrays can only 432 form if sequential nucleosomes adopt nearly identical conformations ( Ekundayo et al . , 433 2017 ; Robinson et al . , 2006 ; Song et al . , 2014 ) . Further investigation is needed to 434 identify the biochemical and biophysical factors responsible for the abundance of non - 435 canonical nucleosomes in yeast and to determine their diverse structures ( Zlatanova et 436 al . , 2009 ) . 437 438 In combination with our previous work on a HeLa cell ( Cai et al . , 2018a ) , we show that 439 globular complexes as small as canonical nucleosomes ( ~ 200 kilodaltons ) can be 440 detected by 3 - D classification of subtomograms from cryolamellae that were imaged 441 with a VPP . Given the low throughput of cryo - FIB milling , the low yield of cryolamellae 442 thinner than 160 nm , and the technical difficulties of VPP imaging , it is not yet feasible 443 to systematically determine the conditions needed to detect sub - 200 kDa complexes by 444 purification in silico . More depositions of eukaryote cryolamellae cryo - ET datasets in the 445 public database EMPIAR ( Iudin et al . , 2016 ) may enable a thorough search of data - 446 collection and processing - parameter space . 447 448 Our in situ cryo - ET - based model adds to the body of work on non - canonical 449 nucleosomes . ChIP - seq analysis has detected sub - nucleosomes in situ , though the 450 22 abundance was unknown ( Rhee et al . , 2014 ) . MNase - seq has also detected 451 nucleosomes in a partially unwrapped and partially disassembled state in situ 452 ( Ramachandran et al . , 2017 ) . A recent Hi - C variant “Hi - CO” presented evidence that < 453 147 bp of yeast nucleosomal DNA is protected from MNase attack ( Ohno et al . , 2019 ) , 454 which is consistent with the partial detachment of core DNA . Molecular dynamics 455 advances in all - atom and coarse - grained simulations are now showing that 456 nucleosomes are far more dynamic than previously appreciated ( Armeev et al . , 2021 ; 457 Brandani et al . , 2021 ; Farr et al . , 2021 ; Huertas et al . , 2021 ; Ishida and Kono , 2021 ) . 458 The DNA - unwrapping associated with nucleosome breathing was shown to disfavor 459 ordered helical oligonucleosome structures ( Farr et al . , 2021 ) . Nucleosome breathing is 460 also evident in high - throughput atomic - force microscopy experiments , which revealed 461 that only ~ 30 % of nucleosomes are fully wrapped , and that approximately half of the 462 nucleosomes have an opening angle ( measured between the entry / exit DNA arms ) 60° 463 larger than the fully wrapped one ( Konrad et al . , 2021 ) . Nucleosomes that have non - 464 canonical nucleosome properties , such as lower stability or exposure of internal 465 surfaces , have been reported in fission yeast ( Koyama et al . , 2017 ; Sanulli et al . , 2019 ) , 466 which may explain why we did not observe canonical nucleosomes in cryosections in 467 those cells either ( Cai et al . , 2018b ) . Some nucleosomes in human and fly cell 468 cryosections appear “gaping” , i . e . , with the inter - DNA - gyre distance slightly larger than 469 ~ 2 . 7 nm ( Eltsov et al . , 2018 ) . Partial DNA detachment has been seen in complexes 470 between nucleosomes and remodelers and transcription factors ( Eustermann et al . , 471 2018 ; Farnung et al . , 2017 ; Liu et al . , 2017 ; Sundaramoorthy et al . , 2018 ; 472 Sundaramoorthy et al . , 2017 ; Willhoft et al . , 2018 ) , methyltransferases ( Bilokapic and 473 23 Halic , 2019 ; Jang et al . , 2019 ) , or transcription - related complexes ( Dodonova et al . , 474 2020 ; Kujirai et al . , 2018 ) . Larger amounts ( up to ~ 25 bp ) of DNA detachment have 475 been seen very rarely in cryo - EM structures ( Bilokapic et al . , 2018 ; Zhou et al . , 2021 ) . A 476 recent study of cryosectioned fly embryos has also presented evidence of nucleosome - 477 like structures such as hemisomes and three - gyre structures ( Fatmaoui et al . , 2022 ) . 478 The prevalence and functional consequences of non - canonical nucleosomes in situ 479 remain to be studied in other organisms . 480 481 Alternative hypotheses 482 We consider the alternative hypothesis that canonical nucleosomes are the dominant 483 form in situ and that we have missed them as a result of our image processing . Many of 484 the 3 - D class averages appear to have multiple gyre - like densities , which may arise 485 from nucleosome stacking . However , classes with multiple gyre - like densities are also 486 found in the class averages from the cytoplasm , which does not have nucleosomes 487 ( Figure S12 ) . These are “junk” classes that result from the averaging of different particle 488 species into the same class . Importantly , stacked canonical nucleosomes are so 489 conspicuous that they could not have been missed in tomographic slices . For instance , 490 two stacked canonical nucleosomes have twice the mass of a single canonical 491 nucleosome and would have dimensions 12 nm by 10 nm ( Figure S34 ) . Multiple 492 stacked canonical nucleosomes would appear like 10 - nm - thick filaments . 493 494 Another alternative hypothesis is that the lack of disc views , corresponding to 495 nucleosomes whose “face” is parallel to the lamella surface , resulted in canonical 496 24 nucleosomes going undetected . This hypothesis would be supported only if the 497 orientations of canonical nucleosomes were biased . However , biased orientation in 498 cryo - EM experiments is usually a result of interactions with the air - water interface 499 ( Noble et al . , 2018 ) , which does not exist for nucleosomes inside the nucleus of a cell . 500 Another hypothesis is that the missing views resulted in elongated class averages 501 because of the missing wedge or missing cone in Fourier space . This artifact would only 502 affect the distribution of canonical versus non - canonical nucleosomes if canonical 503 nucleosomes have a preferred orientation , which we have just argued against due to 504 the nature of our cellular samples . The class averages from non - disc - view nucleosomes 505 do not have a missing - wedge / cone artifact because they include nucleosomes whose 506 superhelical axes are in the X - Y plane ; when averaged together , the Fourier transforms 507 of these nucleosomes “fill in” Fourier space because they sample numerous rotations 508 about their super - helical axes . Missing - wedge - free reconstructions are exemplified by 509 plunge - frozen actin filaments , which lie parallel to the EM grid . As illustrated in a recent 510 study ( Merino et al . , 2018 ) , reconstructions of filamentous actin are free of missing - 511 wedge distortions even though the axial views are completely absent . 512 513 Some of the particles in the tomographic slices resemble donuts . Because nucleosome 514 disc views also resemble donuts , it is possible that we completely missed these 515 particles in either our template matching or classification analyses . As stated above , 516 even if we missed all the disc views , our conclusions would not change because the 517 orientations of canonical nucleosomes inside of cellular samples are not biased . 518 Furthermore , the donut - like particles cannot be canonical nucleosomes because they 519 25 are too wide ( > 12 nm ) . A subset of them were detected by template matching and 520 classification and separated into their own class , which resembles a cylinder with a 521 rounded cap ( Movie S5 , row 5 column 1 ) . 522 523 Another hypothesis for the low numbers of detected canonical nucleosomes is that the 524 nucleoplasm is too crowded . However , crowding is an unlikely explanation because we 525 were able to detect canonical nucleosome class averages in our most - crowded nuclear 526 lysates , which are so crowded that most nucleosomes are butted against others 527 ( Figures S15 and S16 ) . 528 529 Limitations of the study 530 Because naked linker DNA cannot yet be seen in situ in yeast , the connectivity between 531 the nucleosomes ( both canonical and non - canonical ) could not be followed . The 532 subtomogram analysis was unable to resolve the structures of the non - canonical 533 nucleosomes . Because of the low resolution , we could not assess the variability in the 534 structure and composition of the canonical nucleosomes . All of these limitations could 535 potentially be addressed by increasing the data quality and the numbers of classes and 536 subtomograms per class , which require advances at all stages of structural cell biology . 537 These advances include improvements in cryo - FIB milling throughput and 538 reproducibility ( Buckley et al . , 2020 ; Tacke et al . , 2021 ; Zachs et al . , 2020 ) , cryo - EM 539 cameras , laser phase plates ( Turnbaugh et al . , 2021 ) , template - matching / 540 segmentation software ( Bepler et al . , 2020 ; Moebel et al . , 2021 ) , and subtilt refinement 541 software such as emClarity ( Himes and Zhang , 2018 ) , EMAN2 ( Chen et al . , 2019 ) , 542 26 Warp / M ( Tegunov et al . , 2021 ) and RELION 4 ( Zivanov et al . , 2022 ) . Because structural 543 cell biology is still a nascent field , the optimum combination of sample prep , imaging , 544 and data analysis will require thorough exploration of the parameter space at each step . 545 The nucleosome Volta subtomogram averages presented here were limited to ~ 24 Å , 546 even though the data was recorded close to focus as suggested by a higher - resolution 547 study of purified ribosomes ( Khoshouei et al . , 2017 ) . Limiting factors include lower 548 particle numbers , alignment inaccuracy , VPP charging , and the lack of contrast transfer 549 function ( CTF ) modeling . In single - particle cryo - EM analysis , high - resolution analysis ( 3 550 Å or better ) requires accurate modeling and then compensation for the CTF . A key first 551 step of CTF modeling is the visualization of Thon rings in Fourier power spectra . We 552 plotted Fourier power spectra in both 2 - D with CTFFIND ( Rohou and Grigorieff , 2015 ) 553 and as a 1 - D rotational average with IMOD ( Mastronarde , 1997 ) , but could not see 554 Thon rings ( Figure S35 ) , meaning that CTF compensation is not feasible . A study of 555 VPP single - particle cryo - EM analysis recommends intentionally underfocussing to 500 556 nm to increase the number of Thon rings , making CTF modeling easier ( Danev et al . , 557 2017 ) . However , the samples used in that study were much thinner ( plunge - frozen 558 proteasomes ) and the dose used per image was much higher ( ~ 40 electrons / Å 2 ) . 559 Because the subtomogram analysis of smaller complexes inside cryolamellae faces 560 multiple challenges , more investigation is needed to determine the optimum parameters 561 for increased resolution . 562 563 Another challenge is the positive identification of the non - canonical nucleosome 564 species . The approaches attempted here ( the use of a GFP tag ) failed . An alternative 565 27 approach would be to remap the various averages and show that the linker DNA of 566 sequential non - canonical nucleosomes point to each other , as we have previously done 567 for HeLa chromatin in situ ( Cai et al . , 2018a ) . Unfortunately , this approach is not 568 suitable for yeast because only the canonical class averages have linker - DNA densities 569 – none of the other class averages have densities that resemble linker DNA . Because 570 non - canonical yeast nucleosomes in situ are unknown structures , we would have to 571 identify individual instances using a “GFP of cryo - EM” , in the form of a compact fusion 572 protein - like structure that can be directly visualized in tomographic slices without 573 classification and subtomogram averaging . Several attempts have been made in recent 574 decades ( Diestra et al . , 2009 ; Mercogliano and DeRosier , 2007 ; Nishino et al . , 2007 ; 575 Wang et al . , 2011 ) . More work is needed to test the suitability of such tags as “GFPs of 576 cryo - EM” in situ . 577 28 SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION 578 Supplemental information can be found online at doi - xyz 579 580 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 581 We thank Kerry Bloom , Vu Nguyen , and Carl Wu for advice on fluorescent - protein 582 tagging of histones ; Bill Rice and Ed Eng for help with cryo - EM data collection ; John 583 Heumann for discussions about PEET and for implementing a parallelized duplicate - 584 removal routine ; Rado Danev , Kliment Verba , and Shenping Wu for advice on the VPP . 585 The Quadro P6000 used in this work was kindly donated by the NVIDIA Corporation . 586 ZYT , SC , JKC , and LG were supported by a Singapore Ministry of Education Tier 1 587 grant R - 154 - 000 - A49 - 114 and Tier 2 grant MOE2019 - T2 - 1 - 140 .

All yeast strains are of mating 652 type a . Modifications or lack thereof to all histone genes were authenticated by PCR 653 and Sanger sequencing ( Bio Basic Asia Pacific Pte Ltd , Singapore ) in all yeast strains . 654 655 Bacterial Growth Conditions 656 The plasmids shown in the key resources table are provided in DH5 - Alpha Escherichia 657 coli . The bacteria were streaked on LB agar plates with ampicillin ( 40 g / L LB Broth with 658 agar ( Miller ) , 100 μ g / mL ampicillin ) at 37°C and cultured in LB liquid medium with 659 ampicillin ( 25 g / L LB Broth ( Miller ) , 100 μ g / mL ampicillin ) in vent cap tubes shaking at 660 200 – 250 RPM at 37°C . 661 662 METHOD DETAILS 663 Plasmid extraction and linearization 664 The pFA6a plasmids ( Lee et al . , 2013 ; Longtine et al . , 1998 ) used are shown in the key 665 resources table . The plasmid pFA6a - GFP ( S65T ) - His3MX6 was a gift from John Pringle 666 ( Addgene 41598 ; Addgene , Watertown , MA ) and pFA6a - link - yoTagRFP - T - Kan was a 667 gift from Wendell Lim & Kurt Thorn ( Addgene 44906 ) ; both were given in the form of 668 bacterial stabs . Note that pFA6a - link - yoTagRFP - T - Kan is the source of the KanR 669 32 marker used to delete HTB2 - HTA2 . Five mL of bacteria were cultured overnight , then 670 plasmids were extracted with the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit ( QIAGEN , Hilden , 671 Germany ) following the manufacturer’s instructions . 672 673 Extracted plasmids were linearized by double digestion with a reaction containing 1 µg 674 of plasmid DNA , 5 µL of 10× rCutSmart™ Buffer ( New England BioLabs , Ipswich , MA ) , 675 10 units each of Sal I and EcoR V restriction enzymes ( New England BioLabs ) topped up 676 to 50 µL with nuclease - free water . The reaction mixture was heated at 37°C for 15 677 minutes for the digestion reaction , then 80°C for 20 minutes to inactivate the enzymes . 678 679 Strain construction 680 The strain details are shown in Table S1 . Primers were from IDT ( Integrated DNA 681 Technologies , Inc . , Singapore ) and listed in Table S2 . Q5 PCR Master Mix ( New 682 England BioLabs ) was used for PCR reactions . BY4741 ( Brachmann et al . , 1998 ) 683 served as the wild - type strain . Tagging and deletion cassettes were amplified from 684 linearized pFA6a plasmids ( Lee et al . , 2013 ; Longtine et al . , 1998 ) with a PCR reaction 685 containing 1 ng of template DN A and 0 . 5 μ M of each primer , using a PCR program of 686 98°C for 30 seconds , 30 cycles of 98°C for 5 seconds , 60°C for 10 seconds and 72°C 687 for 1 . 5 minutes , then 72°C for 5 minutes . 688 689 Cells were transformed using the lithium acetate / PEG4000 method reported in 690 ( Nishimura and Kanemaki , 2014 ) . Overnight cell culture in YPD was diluted to 0 . 1 OD 600 691 in 25 mL of YPD and grown to 0 . 3 OD 600 . Ten mL of cells were collected , centrifuged at 692 33 1 , 600 × g at 25°C for 3 minutes , and the supernatant was removed . The cells were then 693 washed twice with 10 mL sterile water with centrifugation at 1 , 600 × g at 25°C for 3 694 minutes . The cells were resuspended in 1 mL sterile water , transferred to a new 1 . 5 mL 695 collection tube , centrifuged at 17 , 900 × g at 25°C for 1 minute , washed in 1 mL of 696 TE / LiAc ( 10 mM tris , 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) , 100 mM lithium 697 acetate ) , with centrifugation at 17 , 900 × g for 1 minute , and resuspended in 50 μ L of the 698 same buffer . Fifty μ L of cell suspension was transferred to a new 1 . 5 mL collection tube 699 containing 5 μ L of 10 mg / mL salmon sperm DNA ( Sigma - Aldrich , Burlington , MA ) plus 5 700 μ L of PCR - amplified cassette DNA . 360 µL of TE / LiAc / PEG ( 10 mM tris , 1 mM EDTA , 701 100 mM lithium acetate , 40 % w / v Polyethylene glycol 4000 ) was added and incubated 702 with shaking at 25°C for 30 minutes . Forty µL of dimethyl sulfoxide was added , the 703 suspension was incubated at 42°C for 15 minutes in a water bath , then cooled on ice for 704 2 minutes . The suspension was centrifuged at 13 , 000 x g for 1 minute , the liquid was 705 removed , and the cells were resuspended in 300 μ L of 1× TE buffer , pH 8 . 0 ( 10 mM tris , 706 1 mM EDTA ) . Two hundred μ L of this cell suspension was plated on a selection plate 707 and incubated for several days at 30°C . Histidine selection plates were created with 6 . 7 708 g / L yeast nitrogen base without amino acids ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , 1 . 92 g / L yeast synthetic 709 drop - out medium supplements without histidine ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , 2 % w / v glucose and 710 2 % w / v agar . G418 selection plates were created by adding G418 to the molten agar 711 ( YPD for G418 single selection , histidine auxotrophy medium for double selection ) to a 712 concentration of 200 mg / L before it was poured . 713 714 Transformants were validated by PCR and Sanger sequencing . Genomic DNA was 715 34 extracted with the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit ( QIAGEN ) following the manufacturer’s 716 instructions . Confirmation PCR was performed with 1 µg of template genomic DN A and 717 0 . 5 μ M of each primer , using a PCR program of 94°C for 2 minutes , 30 cycles of 94°C 718 for 1 minute , 62°C for 1 minute and 72°C for 3 . 5 minutes , then 72°C for 5 minutes . PCR 719 products were purified with the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit ( QIAGEN ) following the 720 manufacturer’s instructions , with water used for the final elution before they were sent 721 for Sanger sequencing . 722 723 DNA gels and immunoblots 724 PCR products were electrophoresed in 2 % agarose in Tris - acetate - EDTA and 725 visualized with FloroSafe DNA Stain ( Axil Scientific Pte Ltd , Singapore ) . The 726 electrophoresis was performed at 100 Volts for 60 – 80 minutes before visualization with 727 a G : Box ( Syngene ) . 728 729 To generate protein samples for immunoblot analysis , ~ 20 OD 600 units of yeast cells 730 were pelleted and stored at −80°C for at least 1 hour . Cells were then resuspended in 731 200 µL of ice - cold 20 % trichloroacetic acid ( TCA ) and vortexed with glass beads at 4°C 732 for 1 minute 4 times . For each sample , 500 µL of ice - cold 5 % TCA was added , mixed 733 with the pellet , then transferred to a new 1 . 5 mL collection tube . Another 500 µL of ice - 734 cold 5 % TCA was mixed with each pellet and transferred to the same 1 . 5 mL collection 735 tube as before , so that each collection tube had 1 mL total volume . The tubes were then 736 left on ice for 10 minutes and centrifuged at 15 , 000 × g at 4°C for 20 minutes . The TCA 737 was aspirated from the tube , then the pellet was resuspended in 212 µL of Laemmli 738 35 sample buffer with 2 - mercaptoethanol added ( Bio - Rad , Hercules , CA ) . To neutralize the 739 residual TCA , 26 µL of 1 M Tris , pH 8 was added . This mixture was heated at 95°C for 5 740 minutes , centrifuged at 25°C at 15 , 000 × g for 10 minutes , then 5 µL of the supernatant 741 was subjected to SDS - PAGE . 742 743 The primary and secondary antibodies used for immunoblots are shown in Table S3 . 744 10 % Mini - PROTEAN® TGX™ Precast Protein Gels ( Bio - Rad ) were used , with either 745 Precision Plus Protein™ WesternC™ Standards ( Bio - Rad ) or Invitrogen™ MagicMark™ 746 XP Western Protein Standard ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , TFS , Waltham , MA ) used as 747 the ladder . The proteins were electrophoresed at 100 Volts for 1 hour at 25°C . The gels 748 were transferred onto Immun - Blot® PVDF Membranes ( Bio - Rad ) at 4°C in transfer 749 buffer ( 3 . 02 g / L tris , 14 . 4 g / L glycine , 20 % methanol ) . The transfer was performed at 750 100 Volts for 30 minutes . The membranes were then blocked with 2 % BSA in 1× Tris - 751 Buffered Saline , 0 . 1 % Tween® 20 Detergent ( TBST ) for 1 hour . This was followed by 50 752 µg / mL avidin in TBST for 30 minutes , then a wash with TBST for 20 minutes if Precision 753 Plus Protein™ WesternC™ Standards ladder was used . All antibody dilution factors are 754 reported in Table S3 . The membranes were probed with primary antibodies at the 755 stated dilutions in 2 % BSA in TBST for 1 hour at 25°C . Membranes were washed with 756 TBST for 20 minutes three times at 25°C . The membranes were then probed with 757 secondary antibodies in 2 % BSA in TBST for 1 hour , with additional Precision Protein™ 758 StrepTactin - HRP Conjugate ( Bio - Rad ) at 1 : 10 , 000 dilution if Precision Plus Protein™ 759 WesternC™ Standards ladder was used . Finally , the membranes were washed with 760 TBST for 10 minutes 3 times , then treated with a 50 : 50 mixture of Clarity Western 761 36 Peroxide Reagent and Clarity Western Luminol / Enhancer Reagent ( Bio - Rad ) for 5 762 minutes before visualization by chemiluminescence on an ImageQuant LAS 4000 763 ( Cytiva , Marlborough , MA ) . 764 765 Fluorescence microscopy 766 Cells were grown to log phase ( OD 600 = 0 . 1 – 1 . 0 ) , of which 2 OD 600 units of cells were 767 collected , pelleted at 5 , 000 × g for 1 minute , then resuspended in 1 mL of YPD . Four µL 768 of cell culture was then applied to a glass slide and pressed against a coverslip . The 769 cells were imaged live at 23°C with an Olympus FV3000 Confocal Laser Scanning 770 Microscope ( Olympus , Tokyo , Japan ) equipped with a 1 . 35 NA 60× oil - immersion 771 objective lens . GFP fluorescence was acquired using the 488 nm laser - line , with a DIC 772 image recorded in parallel with the fluorescence image . Images were captured as Z - 773 stacks thick enough to sample the GFP signals through all the nuclei in each stage 774 position . Additional details regarding data collection are shown in Table S4 . 775 776 Preparation of nuclear lysates 777 Yeast nuclei were prepared with reagents from the Yeast nuclei isolation kit ( Abcam 778 206997 , Cambridge , United Kingdom ) , unless noted otherwise . Yeast cells ( 30 mL , 779 OD 600 ~ 1 ) were pelleted at 3 , 000 × g for 5 minutes at 25°C . The pellet was washed 780 twice with 1 mL water ( 3 , 000 × g , 1 minute ) . The pellet was then resuspended in 1 mL 781 Buffer A ( pre - warmed to 30°C ) containing 10 mM dithiothreitol . The suspension was 782 incubated in a 30°C water bath for 10 minutes . Cells were then pelleted at 1 , 500 × g for 783 5 minutes and then resuspended in 1 mL Buffer B ( prewarmed to 30°C ) containing lysis 784 37 enzyme cocktail ( 1 : 100 dilution ) . The suspension was incubated in a 30°C shaker for 15 785 minutes for cell - wall digestion and then pelleted at 1 , 500 × g for 5 minutes at 4°C . The 786 pellet was resuspended in 1 mL pre - chilled Buffer C with protease inhibitor cocktail 787 ( 1 : 1 , 000 dilution ) . The cells were lysed by 15 up - and - down strokes with a pre - chilled 788 glass Dounce homogenizer on ice . The lysate was incubated with shaking for 30 789 minutes at 25°C . The cell debris was pelleted at 500 × g for 5 minutes at 4°C . The 790 supernatant was then transferred to a new tube . The nuclei were pelleted at 20 , 000 × g 791 for 10 minutes at 4°C . The nuclear pellet was resuspended in 10 – 20 µL pre - chilled 792 lysis buffer ( 50 mM EDTA and 1 : 1 , 000 protease inhibitor cocktail dilution ) and incubated 793 for 15 minutes on ice . 794 795 Nuclei lysates ( 3 µL ) were added to a glow - discharged CF - 4 / 2 - 2C - T grid ( Protochips , 796 Morrisville , NC ) . The grid was plunge - frozen using a Vitrobot Mark IV ( blot time : 1 797 second , blot force : 1 , humidity : 100 % , temperature : 4°C ) . 798 799 Preparation of cryosections 800 Self - pressurized freezing was done based on a modified version of a published protocol 801 ( Yakovlev and Downing , 2011 ) . Yeast cells ( 30 mL , OD 600 = 0 . 2 – 0 . 6 ) were pelleted 802 and resuspended in a dextran stock ( 40 kilodalton , 60 % w / v , in YPD ) to a final 803 concentration of 30 % . Cells were then loaded into a copper tube ( 0 . 45 / 0 . 3 mm outer / 804 inner diameters ) . Both ends of the tube were sealed with flat - jaw pliers . The tube was 805 held horizontally and dropped into the liquid - ethane cryogen . The tube’s ends were 806 38 removed under liquid nitrogen with a tube - cut tool ( Engineering Office M . Wohlwend , 807 Sennwald , Switzerland ) . 808 809 Gold colloid solution ( 10 - nm diameter , 5 µL at 5 . 7 ×10 12 particles / mL in 0 . 1 mg / mL BSA ) 810 was applied to a continuous - carbon grid ( 10 - nm thick carbon ) and then air - dried 811 overnight . Cryosections were controlled by a custom joystick - based micromanipulator 812 ( MN - 151S , Narishige Co . , Ltd . , Tokyo , Japan ) ( Ladinsky et al . , 2006 ; Ng et al . , 2020 ) . 813 Seventy nm - thick frozen - hydrated sections were cut at −150°C in a Leica UC7 / FC7 814 cryo - ultramicrotome ( Leica Microsystems , Vienna , Austria ) . The EM grid was positioned 815 underneath the ribbon using a Leica micromanipulator ( Studer et al . , 2014 ) . The 816 cryosection ribbon ( ~ 3 mm long ) was then attached to the grid by operating the Crion 817 ( Leica Microsystems ) in “charge” mode for ~ 30 seconds ( Pierson et al . , 2010 ) . 818 819 Preparation of cryolamellae 820 Cells were plunge - frozen and then cryo - FIB milled using the method of Medeiros and 821 Bock ( Medeiros et al . , 2018 ) as follows . Immediately before plunge - freezing , mid - log 822 phase ( OD 600 ~ 0 . 6 ) yeast cells were pelleted at 4 , 000 × g for 5 minutes . They were then 823 resuspended in YPD media containing 3 % ( v / v ) dimethyl sulfoxide as cryo - protectant to 824 a final OD 600 of approximately 2 . 5 . Four µL of the cells were subsequently deposited 825 onto Quantifoil R2 / 4 200 mesh copper grids ( Quantifoil Micro Tools GmbH , Jena , 826 Germany ) , which were then manually blotted from the back with Whatman® Grade 1 827 filter paper for approximately 3 – 5 seconds . The grids were then plunged into a 63 / 37 828 propane / ethane mixture ( Tivol et al . , 2008 ) using a Vitrobot Mark IV ( humidity : 100 % , 829 39 temperature : 4°C ) . Cryo - FIB milling was performed on a Helios NanoLab 600 830 DualBeam ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , TFS , Waltham , MA ) equipped with a Quorum 831 PolarPrep 2000 transfer system ( Quorum Technologies , Laughton , United Kingdom ) . 832 Plunge - frozen yeast samples were coated with a layer of organometallic platinum using 833 the in - chamber gas injection system and the cold - deposition method ( Hayles et al . , 834 2007 ) . Cryolamellae were then generated as follows : bulk material was first removed 835 using the FIB at 30 kV 2 . 8 nA , followed by successive thinning of the cryolamellae at 836 lower currents of 0 . 28 nA and 48 pA . 837 838 Cryo - ET data collection and reconstruction 839 All cryo - ET data were collected on Titan Krioses ( TFS ) . Tilt series were collected with 840 either TFS Tomo4 , Leginon ( Suloway et al . , 2009 ) , SerialEM ( Mastronarde , 2003 ) , or 841 PACE - tomo ( Eisenstein et al . , 2022 ) . Images were recorded either on a Falcon II ( TFS ) 842 in integration mode or as movie frames on a K2 or K3 summit camera ( Gatan , 843 Pleasanton , CA ) in super - resolution mode . The pixel sizes for the K2 and K3 data were 844 chosen so that when binned to the same level , they closely match the ~ 7 Å pixel size in 845 our previous in situ study of HeLa chromatin ( Cai et al . , 2018a ) . Smaller pixel sizes 846 were chosen for Falcon II data because this camera has lower detective quantum 847 efficiency than the K - series cameras ( Ruskin et al . , 2013 ) . Movies were aligned with 848 either MotionCor2 ( Zheng et al . , 2017 ) or IMOD alignframes ( Mastronarde , 1997 ) . Prior 849 to starting data collection of cryolamellae , the stage was pre - tilted to either −10° or −15° 850 to account for the milling angle . Additional data - collection details are shown in Table S5 . 851 852 40 Volta Phase Plate ( VPP ) imaging was done using the protocol of Fukuda and 853 colleagues { Fukuda , 2015 } . The VPP position and condenser stigmator were adjusted 854 such that the Ronchigram ( the projected pattern visible in the camera ) was free of 855 elongated features , indicating no astigmatism , and is flat rather than grainy , indicating 856 that the VPP is on - plane . Notably , the VPP needs to be heated , or else the phase shift 857 will rapidly exceed π / 2 radians { Danev , 2014 } . Two different VPP assemblies were 858 used , which we will refer to as the NYSBC - 2019 and NUS - 2020 ones . These VPPs 859 required different heater power settings to maintain a stable phase shift . The NYSBC - 860 2019 and NUS - 2020 VPP heaters were operated at ~ 100 mW and ~ 370 mW , 861 respectively . 862 863 Cryotomograms were reconstructed using IMOD’s eTomo workflow ( Mastronarde , 864 1997 ) . Tilt series of lysates and cryosections were aligned using the gold beads as 865 fiducials while those of cryolamellae were aligned with patches as fiducials . Only the tilt 866 series that exhibited the minimal amount of drift and sample warping were analyzed . To 867 further improve the tilt series alignment around the chromatin , fiducials ( beads or 868 patches ) were chosen on the chromatin regions . For cryolamella patch tracking , tilt 869 series were binned to a pixel size of 6 . 8 Å , the “Break contours into pieces w / overlap” 870 was set to 10 , and the low - frequency rolloff sigma and cutoff radius were set to 0 . 03 and 871 0 . 1 pixel −1 , respectively . A boundary model was created so that only the chromatin was 872 enclosed . Fiducial patches were manually deleted if they overlapped with debris like ice 873 crystals or if they mistracked . We did not detect a correlation between the alignment 874 residual ( Table S6 ) and our ability to detect canonical nucleosomes . 875 41 876 CTF estimation and phase flipping were done on the defocus phase contrast datasets 877 using IMOD’s ctfplotter and ctfphaseflip programs . Prior to reconstruction , the 878 cryosection and cryolamellae tilt series were binned to a final pixel size of 6 . 8 Å using 879 the eTomo antialiasing option . Two tomogram versions were reconstructed for each tilt 880 series . For visualization purposes , the tilt series were low - pass filtered to attenuate 881 spatial frequencies beyond 25 Å to 30 Å resolution , prior to tomogram reconstruction . 882 For classification analysis , the tilt series were low - pass filtered with a Gaussian rolloff 883 starting at 15 Å resolution for lysates and 20 Å for cryosections and cryolamellae . In the 884 classification jobs , the resolution of the data was further limited to 25 Å or 20 Å ( see 885 next section for details ) . More details of the datasets analyzed in this paper are shown 886 in Table S6 . 887 888 Nucleosome template matching , classification , and subtomogram averaging 889 A featureless round - edged 10 nm - diameter , 6 nm - thick cylindrical template was created 890 using the Bsoft program beditimg ( Heymann and Belnap , 2007 ) . A cubic search grid 891 with a 12 - nm spacing was created with the PEET program gridInit ( Heumann , 2016 ) . 892 Regions that had high - contrast artifacts from surface contaminants and ice crystals 893 were excluded . Template matching was done using PEET ( Heumann , 2016 ; Heumann 894 et al . , 2011 ; Nicastro et al . , 2006 ) , with a duplicate - removal cutoff distance of 6 nm . To 895 accelerate the runs , no orientation search was done around the cylindrical axis and the 896 resolution was attenuated starting at 70 Å on account of the smooth appearance of the 897 template . Candidate hit lists of different cross - correlation cutoffs were generated using 898 42 the PEET program createAlignedModel , then visualized together with the tomograms in 899 3dmod . The cross - correlation cutoff that eliminated spurious densities ( primarily empty 900 nucleoplasm ) was chosen . The final numbers of subtomograms analyzed for each 901 sample are in Table S7 and in the figures and figure legends . 902 903 Classification and subtomogram analysis were done with RELION ( Kimanius et al . , 904 2016 ; Scheres , 2012 ) , following the workflows in Figure S1 . In the published workflow 905 ( Figure S1A ) ( Bharat and Scheres , 2016 ) , each subtomogram is first averaged by 906 projecting the entire volume ( 16 nm along the Z axis ) , which introduces contributions 907 from densities above and below the candidate nucleosome . To minimize the influence 908 of other densities , pseudo - projections were created by averaging ~ 12 nm along the Z 909 axis , using the ot _ relion _ project . py script . 2 - D classification using mask diameters 910 ranging from 120 Å to 140 Å produced clear nucleosome - like classes , though the 911 smaller masks included fewer adjacent densities . Note that in RELION , only circular 912 masks are available for 2 - D classification , meaning that it is not possible for the pseudo - 913 projected densities to appear cylinder - like due to truncation by the mask . Densities that 914 belonged to the most nucleosome - like classes were exported for 3 - D classification , split 915 into 30 classes . The resolution cutoffs were 25 Å for 2 - D and 20 Å for 3 - D classification . 916 To eliminate the influence of adjacent densities during 3 - D classification , a smooth 917 cylindrical mask with a cosine - shaped edge was applied . The mask was created using 918 beditimg and relion _ mask _ create . Because the GFP densities protrude from the 919 nucleosome surface , we used a 9 nm - tall cylindrical mask for the analysis of 920 nucleosomes with GFP tags , such as LGY0016 nucleosomes . The percentage of 921 43 subtomograms belonging to each class was extracted with the script 922 count _ particles . awk from Guillaume Gaullier ( Gaullier , 2021 ) . 923 924 As observed in our previous study ( Cai et al . , 2018a ) , some nucleosomes were lost in 925 the 2 - D classification process . We therefore used the alternative workflow in which the 926 template matching hits were directly classified in 3 - D ( Figure S1B ) . To accommodate 927 the increased diversity of complexes ( some of which would have been removed had 2 - D 928 classification been done ) , we used 40 classes for BY4741 , LGY0015 , and LGY0016 929 lysates and 100 classes for cryolamellae and lysates of strains in which H3 or H4 were 930 GFP tagged , without prior 2 - D classification . These jobs crashed frequently because the 931 RELION memory usage scales up with the number of classes ( Kimanius et al . , 2016 ) . 932 We were able to eliminate the crash problem by using higher - memory GPUs and by 933 decreasing the number of translational search steps from 5 to 3 or 4 . The canonical 934 nucleosome classes were subjected to “Gold - standard” 3 - D refinement ( Henderson et 935 al . , 2012 ) . No map sharpening was applied . Subtomogram class - average volumes were 936 visualized with UCSF Chimera ( Pettersen et al . , 2004 ) . 937 938 Biased - reference classification control 939 A 14 Å - resolution density map was simulated from the yeast nucleosome crystal 940 structure PDB 1ID3 ( White et al . , 2001 ) using the Bsoft program bgex . To account for 941 the artifacts associated with defocus phase contrast and CTF correction , a 6 µm 942 underfocus was applied and then “corrected” for using the Bsoft program bctf . The map 943 was also subjected to the 20 Å - resolution low - pass filter that was used on the tilt series 944 44 using the IMOD program mtffilter . Template matching was done using this reference , 945 including data to higher resolution ( 28 Å ) than that for the less - biased search above and 946 including a search around all Euler angles . The hits were subjected to 2 - D classification 947 to remove obvious non - nucleosomal densities . Next , the hits were 3 - D classified using 948 the simulated map as an initial alignment reference . To maximize the model bias , the 949 template was only low - pass filtered to 20 Å - resolution instead of the recommended 60 Å 950 ( Bharat and Scheres , 2016 ) . 951 952 Estimation of nucleosomes sampled per cryolamella 953 First , the average concentration of nucleosomes in the chromatin was estimated . The 954 absolute number of nucleosomes per cell determined from genomics is 60 , 000 955 ( Oberbeckmann et al . , 2019 ) . Soft X - ray tomography measurements revealed that the 956 average G1 nucleus volume is 2 µm 3 , of which 20 % is nucleolus ( Uchida et al . , 2011 ) . 957 Accordingly , chromatin ( the nuclear volume not taken by the nucleolus ) , which contains 958 the vast majority of nucleosomes , occupies ~ 1 . 6 µm 3 . These two experimental values 959 give an average nucleosome concentration of 37 , 500 per µm 3 . Next , the nuclear volume 960 sampled by subtomogram analysis was determined by first drawing one closed contour 961 around the chromatin using 3dmod ; this closed contour encloses only the portion of the 962 tomogram that was analyzed by template matching . The volume of this closed contour , 963 which is one - voxel thick , was extracted using the command : 964 imodinfo - F model . mod 965 This command outputs the quantity “Cylinder volume” , in cubic pixels ( voxels ) . The total 966 tomographic volume sampled ( Table S8 ) was obtained by multiplying Cylinder volume , 967 45 the voxel volume ( 0 . 31 nm 3 for 0 . 68 nm pixel size ) , and the number of tomographic 968 slices that contain chromatin . The BY4741 VPP tomograms summed to 0 . 67 µm 3 , which 969 yields ~ 25 , 000 nucleosomes . For the HeLa cell in ( Cai et al . , 2018a ) ( EMPIAR - 10179 ) , 970 the nucleus volume analyzed was 0 . 12 µm 3 . 971 972 Simulations of nucleosome tomographic slices 973 Atomic models of the nucleosome ( PDB 1KX5 ) ( Davey et al . , 2002 ) were manually 974 positioned in UCSF Chimera and edited to remove the N - terminal tails . A 3 - D density 975 map was calculated with the Bsoft program bgex . There is no software that simulates 976 Volta contrast , so we approximated the Volta - induced phase shift by setting the 977 amplitude contrast to 100 % and the defocus to zero in the Bsoft program bctf , followed 978 by “correction” , also done with bctf . A tilt series was calculated from the simulated map 979 using the IMOD program xyzproj . The tilt series was then aligned by cross - correlation 980 and then backprojected using IMOD’s eTomo workflow . Parameters such as pixel size , 981 tilt range , and tilt angle were kept as close to the experimental ones as possible . 982 Tomographic slices were made in IMOD slicer at the same thickness as for the real 983 cryotomograms . 984 985 Ribosome subtomogram analysis control 986 Ribosomes were analyzed using the same software packages as for nucleosomes , as 987 detailed in the workflow in Figure S25 . Candidate ribosomes were template matched in 988 a single VPP tomogram ( from Figure S11 ) , using a 25 - nm - diameter sphere as a 989 reference . The candidate ribosomes were filtered by cross correlation so that obvious 990 46 false positives ( vacuum ) were excluded , leaving 3 , 816 hits . These particles were 991 subjected to direct 3 - D classification with k = 10 , resulting in six non - empty classes . 992 Particles belonging to the two ribosome classes ( 1 , 150 total ) were pooled and “gold - 993 standard” refined , yielding a density map at 28 Å resolution ( FSC = 0 . 143 ) / 33 Å 994 resolution ( FSC = 0 . 5 ) . Density maps were simulated at 15 Å , 20 Å , and 30 Å resolution 995 using the Bsoft program bgex and the yeast ribosome crystal structure ( Ben - Shem et 996 al . , 2011 ) . To approximate the use of the Volta phase plate , the amplitude contrast was 997 set to 90 % and the defocus to −1 µm . 998 47 REFERENCES 999 1000 Armeev , G . A . , A . S . Kniazeva , G . A .

Canonical nucleosomes in vitro and in situ 1306 ( A ) Space - filling model of the reconstituted yeast nucleosome crystal structure ( PDB 1307 1ID3 ) ( White et al . , 2001 ) , showing from left to right , the disc , side , and gyre views . The 1308 pseudo - dyad axis is indicated by the arrow . The DNA is rendered as light blue and the 1309 histones in the core are shaded blue ( H3 ) , green ( H4 ) , red ( H2B ) , and yellow ( H2A ) . ( B ) 1310 Subtomogram average of nucleosomes from wild - type ( BY4741 ) yeast nuclear lysates . 1311 The linker DNA is indicated by the short arrows and the DNA gyre motifs are indicated 1312 by the arrowheads . ( C ) Subtomogram averages of nucleosomes in wild - type 1313 cryolamellae , oriented similarly to the nucleosomes in the other two panels . The upper 1314 ( blue ) class has more ordered linker DNA than the lower ( magenta ) class . Note that the 1315 subtomogram average in panel B looks different from those in panel C ( and in Figures 3 1316 and S17 ) because it is at higher resolution ( 18 Å vs 24 Å ) . 1317 57 1318 Figure 2 . Canonical nucleosomes are rare in wild - type cells 1319 ( A ) VPP tomographic slice ( 12 nm ) of a BY4741 cell cryolamella . Large subcellular 1320 structures are labeled : nuclear pore complex ( NPC ) , nuclear megacomplex ( M ) , nuclear 1321 microtubule ( MT ) , nuclear envelope ( NE ) , and ribosome ( R ) . The inset is a 4 - fold 1322 enlargement of the boxed area , and a nucleosome - like particle ( n ) is indicated . ( B ) 1323 Remapped model of the two canonical nucleosome class averages in the tomogram 1324 from panel A . The approximate location of the nuclear envelope is indicated by the blue 1325 dashed line . The insets B1 and B2 show 4 - fold enlargements of the corresponding 1326 boxed areas . Note that the remapped model projects the full 150 nm thickness of this 1327 cryolamella . 1328 58 1329 Figure 3 . Visualization of GFP - tagged nucleosomes in vitro 1330 ( A ) Example 2 - D class averages of nucleosome - like particles that were template - 1331 matched with a featureless cylinder reference . Out of 88 , 896 template - matched 1332 particles , 66 , 328 were retained after 2 - D classification . ( B ) Class averages ( 3 - D ) of 1333 nucleosomes from nuclear lysates . Solid arrowheads indicate the extra ( GFP ) densities . 1334 Open arrowheads indicate the positions that lack this density . These class averages 1335 were obtained after classification directly from subtomogram averaging , without an 1336 intervening 2 - D classification step . ( C ) The approximate positions of the H2A C - termini 1337 are rendered in yellow and indicated by arrows in the crystal structure of the yeast 1338 nucleosome ( White et al . , 2001 ) . Note that in the crystal structure , fewer of the H2A C - 1339 terminal amino acids were modeled than for H2B , meaning that the H2A C - terminus is 1340 not perfectly ordered . To facilitate comparison , this structure is oriented like the class 1341 averages in panel B . The nucleosome densities in panel B are longer along the pseudo - 1342 dyad axis ( horizontal ) because they have linker DNA , which is absent in the 1343 nucleosome crystal structure . 1344 59 1345 Figure 4 . Canonical nucleosome class averages are not detected in LGY0016 1346 ( H2A - GFP ) in situ 1347 Class averages ( 3 - D ) of nucleosome - like particles in VPP cryotomograms of LGY0016 1348 cryolamellae . The starred classes have two linear motifs . Movie S5 shows the progress 1349 of this classification job . 1350 60 1351 Figure 5 . Models of yeast nucleosome heterogeneity 1352 Schematics of DNA ( light blue ) and histones ( shaded pie slices ) in the nucleosome disc 1353 view .

( B ) 1355 Nucleosome with alternative histone H2A - H2B ( yellow , red ) conformations and partially 1356 dissociated DNA . ( C ) Nucleosome bound to non - histone proteins ( gray ) . The blurred 1357 gray box represents different proteins that can bind , thereby contributing to 1358 constitutional heterogeneity . The blurred appearance represents a large range of 1359 positions and orientations that protein and DNA components adopt inside cells , which 1360 would result in the absence of a class average resembling a canonical nucleosome . ( D ) 1361 Canonical nucleosomes are a minority conformation in situ . 1362 61 1363 Figure S1 . Subtomogram classification workflow 1364 Classification starts with subtomograms that contain nucleosome - like particles , template 1365 matched in PEET ( Cai et al . , 2018 ) . ( A ) In the workflow recommended by Bharat 1366 ( Bharat et al . , 2015 ) , the subtomograms are first subjected to sequential rounds of 2 - D 1367 classification to remove particles that belong to ‘bad’ classes . Once the bad classes are 1368 removed , the remaining set is subjected to 3 - D classification . ( B ) In the alternative 1369 “direct 3 - D” classification workflow , the subtomograms are subjected directly to 3 - D 1370 classification . The 2 - D classification steps ( greyed out ) are bypassed . 1371 62 1372 63 Figure S2 . Overview of BY4741 ( Wild type ) nuclear lysate 1373 Tomographic slice ( 12 nm ) of BY4741 nuclear lysates .

The abundant granular densities in this field of view are nucleosome - like particles . 1377 One example is indicated in the 4 - fold enlargement in the inset ( n ) .

The class averages whose member particles were selected for 1398 additional rounds of classification are indicated by a green triangle in the box’s lower 1399 right corner .

Note that this percentage is relative to the 129 , 473 template - matched 1441 nucleosome - like particles , not the ~ 25 , 000 expected number of nucleosomes in the 5 1442 tomograms . ( B ) Second round of classification from the canonical nucleosome class 1443 identified in panel A . ( C ) The resolution of both class averages is ~ 24 Å by the FSC = 1444 0 . 5 criterion .

Control VPP subtomogram analysis of ribosomes in situ 1576 ( A ) Candidate ribosomes were template matched from a single VPP tomogram of the 1577 cytoplasm from Figure S11 , using a 25 - nm - diameter sphere as a reference . Direct 3 - D 1578 classification into ten classes led to six non - empty classes , of which two were of 1579 ribosomes . Note that template matching is insufficient to uniquely identify a 1580 macromolecular complex , particularly when the reference is a featureless body like a 1581 sphere or cylinder . A simple reference was used to reduce the model bias . Template 1582 matching done with featureless references generates substantial numbers of false 1583 positives , which are confidently removed by classification . Complexes are only 1584 considered as identified after the 3 - D classification step produces recognizable class 1585 averages . Therefore , the term “candidate ribosomes” is used to describe the 3 , 816 1586 template matching hits . ( B ) The 1 , 150 ribosome subtomograms were pooled and 3 - D 1587 refined , producing an average at 28 Å resolution by the “Gold - standard” FSC ( 0 . 143 1588 cutoff ) criterion and 33 Å resolution with an FSC = 0 . 5 cutoff .

The K2 and K3 raw data were collected in super - resolution mode , 1728 with ½ the pixel size reported in the table . Pixel size therefore refers to the camera’s 1729 “bin ×1” pixel . * Refined defocus ( ∆ f ) values are reported for defocus phase - contrast 1730 data while nominal defoci are reported for Volta phase - contrast ( VPP ) data . ∆ tilt = tilt 1731 increment . Fig = figures that show this dataset ; those without a figure number were 1732 used for subtomogram averaging . Camera ( Cam ) : FII = Falcon II , K2 = K2 - GIF , K3 = 1733 K3 - GIF . thick = thickness , measured from the reconstructed tomogram . For 1734 cryosections , the thickness is variable due to the presence of crevasses . resid = 1735 alignment residual , in nanometers . 1736 113 Table S7 .
