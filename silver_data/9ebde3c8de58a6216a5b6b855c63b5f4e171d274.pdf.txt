Solution structure of Ca 2 + - free rat a - parvalbumin MICHAEL T . HENZL 1 AND JOHN J . TANNER 1 , 2 1 Department of Biochemistry , University of Missouri - Columbia , Columbia , Missouri 65211 , USA 2 Department of Chemistry , University of Missouri - Columbia , Columbia , Missouri 65211 , USA ( R ECEIVED October 25 , 2007 ; F INAL R EVISION October 25 , 2007 ; A CCEPTED November 26 , 2007 ) Abstract Mammals express two parvalbumins—an a isoform and a b isoform . In rat , the a - parvalbumin ( a - PV ) exhibits superior divalent ion affinity . For example , the standard free energies for Ca 2 + binding differ by 5 . 5 kcal / mol in 0 . 15 M KCl ( pH 7 . 4 ) . High - resolution structures of the Ca 2 + - bound proteins provide little insight into this disparity , prompting a structural analysis of the apo - proteins . A recent analysis of rat b - PV suggested that Ca 2 + removal provokes substantial conformational changes—reorientation of the C , D , and E helices ; reorganization of the hydrophobic core ; reduced interdomain contact ; and remodeling of the AB domain . The energetic penalty attendant to reversing these changes , it was sug - gested , could contribute to the attenuated divalent ion - binding signature of that protein . That hypothesis is supported by data presented herein , describing the solution structure and peptide backbone dynamics of Ca 2 + - free rat a - PV . In marked contrast to rat b - PV , the apo - and Ca 2 + - loaded forms of the rat a isoform are quite similar . Significant structural differences appear to be confined to the loop regions of the molecule . This finding implies that the a - PV isoform enjoys elevated divalent ion affinity because the metal ion - binding events do not require major structural rearrangement and the concomitant sacrifice of binding energy .

In fact , the crystal structure of carp parvalbumin ( PV ) estab - lished the EF - hand paradigm ( Kretsinger and Nockolds 1973 ) . The PV family includes a - and b sublineages ( Goodman and Pechere 1977 ; Moncrief et al . 1990 ) , and mammals express one isoform from each ( Fohr et al . 1993 ) . Although parvalbumins are believed to function primarily as cytosolic Ca 2 + - buffers , certain isoforms evi - dently play additional roles . For example , the mammalian b - PV , a . k . a . oncomodulin , is secreted by activated macro - phages and functions as a potent nerve growth factor for retinal ganglion cells ( Yin et al . 2006 ) . The PV tertiary structure includes six a - helical seg - ments ( A – F ) organized into two domains—the N - terminal AB domain ( residues 1 – 38 ) and the CD - EF domain . The two metal ion - binding sites , the CD and EF sites , are related by an approximate twofold symmetry axis and are physi - cally linked by a short fragment of antiparallel b structure . Despite 49 % sequence identity ( Berchtold and Means 1985 ; Gillen et al . 1987 ) , the rat a - and b - PVs exhibit distinct divalent ion - binding affinities .

This difference increases to 5 . 5 kcal / mol when K + replaces Na + as the major solvent cation ( Henzl et al . 2004 ) . High - resolution structures are available for the Ca 2 + - bound a - and b - parvalbumins from rat ( Ahmed et al . 1993 ; McPhalen et al . 1994 ; Bottoms et al . 2004 ) . How - ever , they provide little insight into the disparate ion - binding properties of the proteins , suggesting that the unliganded state may influence the divalent ion - binding signature . We recently described the solution structure of Ca 2 + - free rat b - PV ( Henzl and Tanner 2007 ) . This article presents corresponding data for the Ca 2 + - free a isoform . Results Resonance assignments At 25 ° C , Ca 2 + - free rat a - PV exhibits a well - resolved 1 H - 15 N HSQC spectrum ( Fig . 1 ) , which differs perceptibly from that of the Ca 2 + - loaded protein under comparable solution conditions ( Supplemental Fig . S1 ) . Except for M2 and D25 , all of the expected amide signals are present . The following resonances are substantially over - lapped : I5 / E62 , L6 / K12 , A14 / V43 , A20 / L63 , S36 / E108 , L67 / M86 , E81 / V99 , K83 / E100 , and E101 / A107 . Assignments were made using a suite of three - dimen - sional ( 3D ) , triple - resonance experiments . Aliphatic side - chain carbon assignments were complete , excluding the 24 carboxylates ( Asp , Glu , and C terminus ) , the Q31 carboxamide , the R75 guanidinino group , and the methio - nine methyl groups . Aromatic side - chain assignments were lacking for C g and C z in the eight phenylalanine resi - dues . Proton assignments ( side - chain and backbone ) were 95 % complete . The tabulated chemical shifts served as input for CSI and TALOS . The former returned f and c estimates for 71 residues . The latter provided f , c predictions for 77 residues . Solution structure of Ca 2 + - free rat a - PV The tertiary structure of Ca 2 + - free rat a - PV was calcu - lated with distance and dihedral angle restraints ( Table 1 ) , using ARIA / CNS ( Brunger et al . 1998 ; Linge et al . 2001 ) . Figure 2 displays an ensemble of 20 low - energy con - formers . Relative to the ensemble average , the RMSD is 0 . 81 A ˚ for the backbone atoms ( C b , C a , C 9 , O , and N ) and 1 . 26 A˚ for all heavy atoms . Table 1 presents additional structural quality statistics for the ensemble . According to PROCHECK , all but 0 . 3 % of the f , c combinations reside in allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot . Addition - ally , the structures exhibit few distance violations exceed - ing 0 . 5 A˚ or dihedral violations exceeding 5 ° . Comparison of the Ca 2 + - bound and Ca 2 + - free a - PV structures The ensemble - averaged Ca 2 + - free structure ( silver ) has been superimposed on the crystal structure ( blue ) of Figure 1 . 1 H - 15 N HSQC spectrum of Ca 2 + - free rat a - PV in 0 . 15 M NaCl , 0 . 01 M Mes , and 0 . 005 M EDTA ( pH 6 . 0 ) at 25 ° C .

Although the protein fold is very similar in the presence and absence of Ca 2 + , several local conforma - tional differences are observed . The C a RMSD values for the apo - and Ca 2 + - loaded forms are plotted in Figure 4A . The largest discrepancies between the two structures occur in the loop between the A and B helices , the CD binding loop , the extended loop joining the D and E helices , and the EF binding loop . The average C a RMSD is 2 . 4 A˚ . Figure 5 displays the CD and EF binding pockets in the Ca 2 + - loaded ( panel A ) and unliganded ( panel B ) forms of rat a - PV . The short fragment of antiparallel b structure that links the CD and EF sites is evidently preserved in the apo - protein . Comparison of Ca 2 + - free rat a - and b - PVs The representative solution structures of the Ca 2 + - free rat a - PV ( silver ) and b - PV ( magenta ) isoforms are compared in Figure 6 . The C a RMSD values are plotted in Figure 4B . In this superposition , the B and F helices are largely coincident , and good agreement is also observed for the E helix . However , the orientations of the remaining three helices differ substantially . The deviation in helix D is particularly noteworthy . In the a isoform , the side chain of F70 remains associated with the hydrophobic core in the absence of Ca 2 + , requiring distortion of the D helix . In the b isoform , however , F70 has withdrawn from protein interior , permitting the D helix to straighten . Smaller , but significant , deviations are also observed in the C and A helices . The ensemble - averaged C a RMSD is 3 . 1 A˚ . PV CD - and EF - binding loops are related by an approx - imate twofold symmetry axis . In the Ca 2 + - bound form , they are physically joined by a segment of antiparallel b structure formed by I58 and I97 . Whereas the a - PV retains this motif in the Ca 2 + - free form , as noted above , the b isoform does not . 15 N relaxation data analysis Relaxation data were collected on Ca 2 + - free rat a - PV at 25 ° C . The T 1 and T 2 data are well accommodated by a two - parameter exponential decay model . Representative decays are displayed in Supplemental Figure S2 . R 1 and R 2 values were extracted for 88 of 108 amide vectors and are plotted in Figure 7 , A and B , respectively . The numerical values are listed in Supplemental Table S1 . The overall rotational correlation time ( t c ) was esti - mated from a subset of amide vectors ( Fig . 7C , d ) exhibiting an R 2 / R 1 ratio within 1 SD of the mean . These data are well accommodated by a spherically symmetric rotational diffusion model , yielding a t c value of 6 . 49 6 0 . 03 nsec . Axially symmetric and fully symmetric models yielded insignificant reductions in x 2 . The { 1 H } 15 N NOE values ( Fig . 7D ) exhibit a high degree of uniformity . Significant reductions in the NOE are restricted to A21 , D22 , K37 , K52 , D61 , K91 , and S109 . Excluding these residues , the average NOE value is 0 . 80 . Table 1 .

Relax - ation data for 88 amide vectors were analyzed , using a spherically symmetric diffusion model . The results are displayed in Figure 7 , E and F , and the model - free param - eters are listed in Supplemental Table S2 . The majority of signals ( 67 / 88 ) can be modeled with the overall rotational correlation time ( t c ) and a general - ized order parameter ( S 2 ) . Five amide vectors require a t e term to describe internal motion on the 20 - psec to 10 - nsec timescale . An additional three require an R ex term to de - scribe internal motion on the microsecond to millisecond timescale . Three amides ( residues 19 , 52 , and 92 ) can be accommodated only by inclusion of both t e and R ex terms . Finally , 10 NH vectors ( 7 , 10 , 23 , 26 , 40 , 42 , 74 , 85 , 105 , 109 ) exhibit behavior consistent with motion on two time - scales shorter than the overall rotational correlation time . The average order parameter for the apo - protein is 0 . 92 . This value is significantly higher than the value of 0 . 85 reported for the Ca 2 + - bound protein ( Baldellon et al . 1998 ) . However , the latter analysis was performed at 32 ° C , rather than 25 ° C , and the order parameter is ex - pected to decrease somewhat with elevated temperature ( Bracken et al . 1999 ) . Nevertheless , the implication is that removal of Ca 2 + does not produce a major increase in backbone motion , at least on the picosecond timescale . Similar behavior was noted previously for the rat b - PV isoform ( Henzl et al . 2002 ; Henzl and Tanner 2007 ) . Discussion Although the a - and b - PV isoforms from rat exhibit distinct divalent ion - binding properties , the Ca 2 + - bound structures of rat a - and b - PV are very similar ( Ahmed et al . 1993 ; McPhalen et al . 1994 ; Bottoms et al . 2004 ) . The average main - chain RMSD value is just 0 . 8 A˚ . Thus , inspection of the Ca 2 + - loaded molecules offers few clues as to the source of the apparent 5 . 5 kcal / mol difference in standard binding free energy observed in 0 . 15 M KCl ( pH 7 . 4 ) . Because divalent ion affinity reflects the difference in the stabilities of the bound and unliganded forms , the disparate divalent ion - binding behaviors could conceiv - ably be dictated at the level of the apo - proteins . To explore this possibility , we have obtained solution struc - tures for the Ca 2 + - free forms of rat a - and b - PV . The structure of the b isoform ( Henzl and Tanner 2007 ) departs significantly from that of the Ca 2 + - bound form . Ca 2 + removal provokes substantial reorientation of the C , D , and E helices and reorganization of the hydrophobic core . F70 and F66 have evidently withdrawn from the protein interior , permitting the D helix to straighten . By contrast , F49 and L85 have assumed more interior positions . These changes in the CD - EF domain reduce the area of apolar contact with the AB domain by nearly 10 % . In consequence , perhaps , the apolar side chains in the AB region exhibit increased intradomain interactions . It was suggested that the energetic penalty associated with reversing these changes could significantly reduce the net binding free energy , providing a potential expla - nation for the attenuated divalent ion affinity . The structural alterations accompanying Ca 2 + removal are evidently less extensive in the rat a isoform . The largest differences are observed in the CD binding loop and in the extended loop joining the A and B helices . Significant differences are also observed in the loop between the D and E helices and in the EF ion - binding loops . However , the six helical segments display good Figure 3 .

These findings are consistent with one - dimensional NMR studies of rat a - PV conducted by Sykes and co - workers two decades ago ( Williams et al . 1986 ) . At 37 ° C , in 0 . 5 M KCl , they observed evidence for two forms of the apo - protein—an unfolded form and a form having a spectroscopic signature very similar to that of the Ca 2 + - bound protein . No evidence of unfolded protein is ob - served in the present study , presumably because the NMR data were collected at lower temperature ( 25 ° C ) and in the presence of 0 . 15 M NaCl . Whereas Ca 2 + - free a - PV exhibits negligible affinity for K + , it binds 1 . 0 equivalent of Na + with an association constant estimated at 630 M (cid:2) 1 ( Henzl et al . 2000 , 2004 ) . Binding of the monovalent cation exerts a pronounced stabilizing influence on the protein . For example , whereas Ca 2 + - free rat a - PV dena - tures at 46 6 0 . 2 ° C in 0 . 20 M NaCl , it denatures at 35 . 5 6 0 . 3 ° C in 0 . 20 M KCl . Even at 25 ° C , the appearance of the 1 H , 15 N HSQC spectrum of rat a - PV is strongly de - pendent on the identity of the major solvent cation ( data not shown ) . Although the average S 2 values obtained from model - free analysis are essentially identical for the two apo - PVs—0 . 916 for a , 0 . 924 for b —their backbone dynamics offer several interesting contrasts . The b isoform displays markedly elevated R 2 values in the CD binding loop and in the F helix , indicative of motion on the microsecond to millisecond timescale . Consistent with that observation , the majority of those amide vectors require an R ex term to adequately model their relaxation behavior . By contrast , the R 2 values measured for rat a - PV in these regions are comparatively uniform , and the relaxation of the amide vectors in question can be satisfactorily modeled without an R ex contribution . The R 2 values for the two proteins are compared in Supplemental Figure S3 . Additionally , Ca 2 + - free rat b - PV displays systemati - cally lower NOE values near the C terminus of the CD binding loop and in the EF binding loop , indicative of motion on the nanosecond timescale . Consistent with that observation , the amide vectors in these regions require a t e term for satisfactory model - free treatment . Once again , the corresponding NOE values determined for the a isoform are remarkably constant over these regions , and there is no requirement for t e in the model - free analysis . The { 1 H } 15 N NOE values for the two proteins are compared in Supplemental Figure S3B . The contrast in the R 2 and NOE profiles suggests that the metal ion - binding loops in the rat b isoform , but not in the a iso - form , experience nanosecond to millisecond motion . Recall that the antiparallel b segment linking the CD and EF loops in the Ca 2 + - loaded proteins is evidently retained in the Ca 2 + - free a - PV and may serve to dampen longer timescale motions in the ion - binding loops . When subjected to model - free analysis , nearly all of the N - H vectors in rat b - PV can be modeled with a single Figure 5 .

Ca 2 + - free a - parvalbumin structure www . proteinscience . org 435 JOBNAME : PROSCI 17 # 3 2008 PAGE : 5 OUTPUT : Thursday February 7 01 : 54 : 27 2008 csh / PROSCI / 152298 / ps0733183 Figs . 5 , 6 live 4 / C order parameter . The two vectors requiring a second order parameter , corresponding to motion on a slower time - scale , reside in the EF - site binding loop ( D94 , G95 ) . By contrast , there are 10 amide vectors in the Ca 2 + - free a isoform that require the second order parameter . The residues in question are scattered throughout the sequence but are absent from the metal ion - binding loops . Thus , although the average order parameters for the two apo - proteins do not differ appreciably , the model - free analysis suggests that , relative to the b isoform , the peptide back - bone of Ca 2 + - free rat a - PV experiences more complex motions on timescales shorter than the overall rotational correlation time . Under resting - state conditions in vivo , the a - PV resides almost exclusively in the Mg 2 + - loaded form , and the apo - form described here is negligibly populated . However , because the divalent ion affinity depends on the free energies of both the bound and unliganded forms , the apo - protein contributes to the divalent ion - binding sig - nature of the protein . The previous structural analysis of Ca 2 + - free rat b - PV suggested that the atypically low diva - lent ion affinity displayed by that protein might reflect the requirement for an energetically costly interconversion of the apo - and Ca 2 + - bound conformations . The structural data presented here for the Ca 2 + - free rat a isoform are compatible with that argument . Specifically , the apo - and Ca 2 + - loaded proteins exhibit very similar tertiary struc - tures . Because energy need not be expended to isomerize the protein , the net free energy change that accompanies divalent ion binding is more favorable . This hypothesis clearly requires additional confirma - tion . If ultimately shown to be valid , it provides an inter - esting correlation between structure and energetics . It does not , however , speak to the underlying physical basis for the structural , and functional , differences . The solution of that problem , still tantalizingly out of reach , will require identification of specific amino acid sequence assignments associated with the low - and high - affinity phenotypes . Materials and Methods Protein expression and purification Recombinant rat a - PV was expressed and purified as described previously ( Henzl and Graham 1999 ) . Besides 13 C 6 - d - glucose and / or 15 NH 4 Cl , the medium consisted of M9 salts supple - mented with 2 . 5 % ( v / v ) Celtone ( Spectra Stable Isotopes ) , 100 m M FeCl 3 , trace elements , and ampicillin ( 300 m g / mL ) . Each L yielded 20 – 25 mg of protein , with purity exceeding 98 % . NMR sample preparation Sufficient protein to yield a 3 mM sample was concentrated to 5 mL by ultrafiltration and then dialyzed at 4 ° C for 48 h , against 4 L of 0 . 15 M NaCl , 0 . 025 M Hepes , and 5 . 0 mM EDTA ( pH 7 . 4 ) . Dialysis was continued for 48 h against 0 . 15 M NaCl , 0 . 01 M Mes , and 5 . 0 mM EDTA ( pH 6 . 0 ) . After adding 0 . 1 volume of buffer prepared in D 2 O and sodium azide ( final concentration 0 . 1 % ) , the solution was concentrated to 0 . 35 mL and loaded into a 5 - mm Shigemi microcell ( Shigemi , Inc . ) . NMR spectroscopy All data were acquired at 25 ° C with BioPack pulse sequences on a Varian INOVA 600 - MHz spectrometer , employing a triple - resonance cryoprobe equipped with pulsed - field z gradient . 1 H chemical shifts were referenced relative to DSS ; 13 C and 15 N shifts were referenced indirectly , employing the 1 H / X frequency ratios . Data were processed with NMRPipe and analyzed with Sparky ( T . D . Goddard and D . G . Kneller , University of Califor - nia , San Francisco ) . Resonance assignments Backbone resonance assignments were made using the follow - ing pairs of 3D experiments : HNCA ( Ikura et al . 1990 ) and Figure 7 .

Aliphatic 13 C assignments beyond C b were collected using the CCONH ( Grzesiek et al . 1993 ) spectrum . Aliphatic side - chain 1 H assignments were made with HCCONH ( Grzesiek et al . 1993 ) , 15 N - edited TOCSY - HSQC ( Marion et al . 1989a ) , and HCCH - TOCSY ( Kay et al . 1993 ) experiments . Aromatic side - chain resonances were assigned using the HBCBCGCDHD ( Yamazaki et al . 1993 ) and HBCBCGCDCEHE ( Yamazaki et al . 1993 ) experiments . Stereo - specific assignments of the methyl protons in valine and leucine were made by analysis of a fractionally 13 C - labeled sample ( Neri et al . 1989 ) . Structural restraints For collection of NOE - based distance restraints , a 3D 15 N - edited NOESY - HSQC ( Marion et al . 1989b ) data set was collected on 15 N - labeled protein , employing a mixing time of 125 msec . A corresponding 13 C - edited experiment was per - formed on 13 C , 15 N - labeled material , using a mixing time of 100 msec . Cross peaks were picked manually and integrated in Sparky . f , c dihedral angle restraints were obtained from TALOS ( Cornilescu et al . 1999 ) and CSI ( Wishart and Sykes 1994 ) . 15 N relaxation data were collected on 15 N - labeled protein , employing the T 1 , T 2 , and { 1 H } 15 N NOE pulse sequences supplied in BioPack . R 1 data were acquired with relaxation delays of 50 , 100 , 150 , 250 , 350 , 450 , 600 , 800 , 1000 , and 1200 msec . R 2 data were acquired with delays of 10 , 30 , 50 , 70 , 90 , 110 , 130 , 150 , 170 , and 190 msec . Replicate data were obtained at three delay values for evaluation of experimental uncertainty . For the measurement of steady - state heteronuclear { 1 H } 15 N - NOEs , HSQC spectra were collected , with or without proton saturation ( 3 . 0 sec ) , employing a total recycle delay period of 5 . 0 sec . Duplicate experiments were performed to obtain an estimate of the experimental uncertainty . Structure calculations were performed with ARIA2 . 0a ( Habeck et al . 2004 ) . ARIA ( Ambiguous Restraints for Iterative Assignment ) integrates automated NOE assignments with CNS - based structure calculations ( Linge et al . 2001 ) . In addition to the 15 N - and 13 C - edited NOESY cross - peak lists , the initial in - put to ARIA also included dihedral angle restraints ( TALOS and CSI ) . The quality of the final structures was analyzed using PROCHECK ( Laskowski et al . 1993 ) . 15 N relaxation analysis Peak intensities in the T 1 , T 2 , and { 1 H } 15 N NOE data sets were measured automatically in Sparky . R 1 and R 2 values were extracted for each peak by fitting signal intensities to a two - parameter single - exponential decay , in Origin , version 7 . 5 ( OriginLab ) . The NOE values represent the ratio of the signal intensities in the presence and absence of proton saturation . These relaxation data were analyzed with Tensor2 ( Dosset et al . 2000 ) . The overall rotational correlation time ( t c ) was estimated from the subset of amide vectors having R 2 / R 1 values within 1 SD of the mean value ( Tjandra et al . 1995 ) . The isotropic rota - tional diffusion model yielded a t c value of 6 . 49 6 0 . 03 nsec , corresponding to a rotational diffusion coefficient of 2 . 56 3 10 7 sec (cid:2) 1 . Axially symmetric and fully anisotropic models did not afford significant improvements in x 2 . Internal mobilities were examined with the Lipari - Szabo model - free formalism ( Lipari and Szabo 1982a , b ) . Tensor2 employs the five models suggested by Clore et al . ( 1990a , b ) and the model selection strategy described by Mandel et al . ( 1995 ) . Coordinate and data deposition The atomic coordinates and structural restraints have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank ( PDB 2JWW ) . 1 H , 15 N , and 13 C assignments have been deposited in BioMagResBank ( BMRB 15 , 517 ) .
