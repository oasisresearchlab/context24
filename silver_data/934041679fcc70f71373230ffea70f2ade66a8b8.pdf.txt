Hell 4 , Helmut Grubmu¨ller 3 , Ulf Diederichsen 2 & Reinhard Jahn 1 Neuronal exocytosis is catalysed by the SNAP receptor protein syntaxin - 1A 1 , which is clustered in the plasma membrane at sites where synaptic vesicles undergo exocytosis 2 , 3 . However , how syntaxin - 1A is sequestered is unknown . Here we show that syntaxin clustering is mediated by electrostatic interactions with the strongly anionic lipid phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP2 ) . Using super - resolution stimulated - emission depletion microscopy on the plasma membranes of PC12 cells , we found that PIP2 is the dominant inner - leaflet lipid in microdomains about 73 nanometresinsize . ThishighaccumulationofPIP2wasrequiredfor syntaxin - 1A sequestering , asdestructionof PIP2bythe phosphatase synaptojanin - 1 reduced syntaxin - 1A clustering . Furthermore , co - reconstitution of PIP2 and the carboxy - terminal part of syntaxin - 1A in artificial giant unilamellar vesicles resulted in segregation of PIP2 and syntaxin - 1A into distinct domains even when cholesterol was absent . Our results demonstrate that electrostatic protein – lipid interactions can result in the formation of microdomains indepen - dently of cholesterol or lipid phases . Phosphoinositides are lipids that contain an inositol head group conjugated to one to three phosphate groups . With , 1 % of total lipids intheinnerleafletoftheplasmamembrane 4 , PIP2isthemostabundant phosphoinositide . EarlierstudiesidentifiedPIP2asasecondmessenger inthe phospholipase - C signalling pathway . However , the listof cellular functions of PIP2 is rapidly growing , and PIP2 is also involved in membrane targeting , cytoskeletal attachment , endocytosis and exocy - tosis 4 . PIP2 interacts with many different proteins , through either unstructured basic residue - rich regions or more - structured domains 4 , 5 . Neuronal exocytosis requires the presence of PIP2 at the plasma membrane 2 , 6 – 8 . The amount of PIP2 at the plasma membrane deter - mines the rate of vesicle priming , the size of the readily releasable pool and the rate of sustained exocytosis in stimulated cells 2 , 6 , 8 . This regu - lation is probably mediated by interactions of PIP2 with proteins involvedindockingandfusionsuchasrabphilin , CAPS , synaptotagmin , SCAMP2 and Mint proteins 6 , 9 . In docking , PIP2 clusters may act as molecular ‘beacons’ that target synaptic vesicles to the fusion sites . Indeed , PIP2 is locally enriched at the sites of docked vesicles and co - localizes with at least 5 – 10 % of the microdomains of syntaxin - 1A 2 , 3 , 9 ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) , the membrane - anchored target SNAP receptor of neuronal exocytosis 1 . The amount of PIP2 at the sites of membrane fusion in PC12 cells has been estimated at 3 – 6 % PIP2 coverage of local cell surface area 9 ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . In these experiments , membrane sheets were specifically stained for PIP2 with the Pleckstrin homology domain of protein lipase C delta fused to green fluorescent protein 9 or citrine ( a yellow fluorescent protein analogue 10 ; PH PLC d – citrine ; Supplementary Figs 1 and 2 ) , and the fluorescence of the punctuated PIP2 micro - domains was quantified . However , this approach underestimates the fraction of PIP2 if the PH PLC d microdomains are smaller than the , 200 - nm diffraction - limited resolution of conventional fluorescence microscopy 9 . Toobtaina moreaccurate estimate , were - analysedPC12 membrane sheets labelled with PH PLC d – citrine or an antibody raised against PIP2 using super - resolution stimulated - emission depletion ( STED ) microscopy 11 ( Fig . 1a – c ) . These experiments revealed that the clusters stained for PIP2 are much smaller than anticipated , with an average diameter of only 73 6 42nm ( s . d . ) . Although this is an overestimate because it represents the microdomain size convolved with the resolution of the STED microscope ( , 60nm ) , it is in good agreement with the size of the syntaxin - 1A microdomains 12 . Using a microdomain size of 73nm , we recalculated the surface density of PIP2 ( Supplementary Methods ) . For this calculation , we first estimated the total amount of PIP2 in a microdomain when sampled at the diffraction - limited resolution of our epifluorescence 1 DepartmentofNeurobiology , MaxPlanckInstituteforBiophysicalChemistry , AmFaßberg11 , 37077Go¨ttingen , Germany . 2 InstituteforOrganicandBiomolecularChemistry , Georg - August - University Go¨ttingen , Tammannstraße2 , 37077Go¨ttingen , Germany . 3 DepartmentofTheoreticalandComputationalBiophysics , MaxPlanckInstituteforBiophysicalChemistry , AmFaßberg11 , 37077Go¨ttingen , Germany . 4 DepartmentofNanobiophotonics , MaxPlanckInstituteforBiophysicalChemistry , AmFaßberg11 , 37077Go¨ttingen , Germany .

All rights reserved ©2011 microscope ( Fig . 1d , black mesh , and Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . We then calculated the peak concentration when this amount of PIP2 was concentrated into 73 - nm microdomains ( Fig . 1d , red mesh ) . Here we assumed a Gaussian distribution of PIP2 in the microdomains . A peak surface coverage of 82 % PIP2 was obtained ( Fig . 1d ) . It must be kept in mind that at these high PIP2 concentrations , molecular crowd - ing might hinder binding of PH PLC d – citrine ; that relatively small errors in microdomain size and microscope resolution result in a substantial error in the PIP2 coverage ; and that PH PLC d – citrine and antibody binding may alter PIP2 localization and is only indicative of PIP2 microdomains . Nevertheless , the PIP2 concentrations that we calculate are much higher than any previous estimate , and it seems safe to conclude that PIP2 is the dominant inner - leaflet lipid in the microdomains . The question then arises of by which molecular mech - anism such high concentrations of PIP2 are achieved . PIP2hasanetnegativechargeof 2 3to 2 5 ( ref . 4 ) andinteractswith polybasic stretches of amino acids 4 , 5 , 13 , 14 . Proteins with such stretches can sequester PIP2 in amounts in excess even of monovalent anionic lipids , such as MARCKS , spermine and even pentalysine 5 , 14 . Similar to these proteins , syntaxin - 1A also possesses a stretch of basic amino acids . These residues are adjacent to the transmembrane domain and are in contact with the head groups of the phospholipids 15 , 16 ( Supplementary Fig . 3a ) . Indeed , it is well established that this con - served stretch with five positive residues ( 260 KARRKK 265 ) interacts with PIP2 9 , 15 – 17 . Removal of charge weakens this interaction ( Sup - plementary Fig . 3b , c ) , but syntaxin - 1A remains capable of fusing membranes even on removal of all five charges 9 , 16 . Because PIP2 co - localizes with at least a fraction of syntaxin - 1A microdomains 2 ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) , we speculated that their interaction might drive domain formation in a manner similar to that in various soluble lipid - binding proteins 5 , 14 . Two independent approaches were used to test this hypothesis : reconstitution in giant unilamellar vesicles 18 ( GUVs ) and hydrolysis of PIP2 in PC12 cells using a membrane - targeted variant of the PIP2 phosphatase synaptojanin - 1 7 . Syntaxin - 1A clustered in a non - raft way in neutral cholesterol – phosphatidylcholine membranes 17 . Here cholesterol clusters syntaxin - 1A by competing for solvation by phosphatidylcholine . Indeed , a synthetic C - terminal peptide of syntaxin - 1A ( residues 257 – 288 ; 3mol % ; Fig . 2 and Supplementary Fig . 4a ) clustered in domains in . 50 % of GUVs composed of 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphatidylcholine ( DOPC ) with 20 mol % cholesterol . This peptide contained both the polybasic juxtamembrane linker and transmembrane region and was amino - terminally labelled with either rhodamine red or Atto 647N . Analysis of fluorescence showed a ( 1 . 6 6 0 . 2 ) - fold ( s . d . ; n 5 18 ) enrichmentofsyntaxin - 1A 257 – 288 intheseclusters , butthisisanunder - estimatelimitedbytheoptics . NegativelychargedPIP2or1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphatidylserine ( DOPS ) dispersed these clusters 17 ( Fig . 2 ) . Thus , although cholesterol competition might explain syntaxin - 1A clusters that are not enriched in PIP2 ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) , it cannot explain the high accumulation of PIP2 at the sites of docked vesicles . However , 1 . 5mol % ( total lipids ) PIP2 also clustered syntaxin - 1A in 1 – 10 - m m domains in 1 – 5 % of the GUVs ( Fig . 2 and SupplementaryFig . 4b , c ) . Thesedomainsdidnotdependoncholesterol orDOPS . Inthesedomains , PIP2was ( 1 . 9 6 0 . 2 ) - fold ( s . d . ; n 5 13 ; Sup - plementaryFig . 5 ) enrichedandsyntaxin - 1A 257 – 288 was ( 5 . 5 6 1 . 4 ) - fold ( s . d . ; n 5 27 ) enriched , calculated on the basis of fluorescence . Notably , no domains were observed without peptide or when the PIP2 concen - tration exceeded 5mol % . Divalent cations can act as bridges between twoadjacentlipids andinduce aggregation ofPIP2into clusters 19 – 21 , but even1mMCa 2 1 wasnotsufficienttoattractsyntaxin - 1Aawayfromthe microdomains . Domains were present both for synthetic dioleoyl - PIP2 and for PIP2 extracted from pig brain ( Supplementary Fig . 4b ) . Thus , syntaxin - 1A can be clustered in the membrane by both cholesterol and PIP2 . Thesecholesterol - andPIP2 - mediatedclustersbothdifferfromlipid ‘rafts’ . They also differ from each other . First , PIP2 domains are always round and only one or two form per vesicle , whereas cholesterol generally ( but not always ) induces many small domains ( Supplemen - tary Fig . 4 ) . Second , fluorescence recovery after photobleaching showed that syntaxin - 1A remained mobile in the PIP2 domains and thatsyntaxin - 1Awasessentiallyimmobileinthecholesterol - dependent clusters ( Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . Syntaxin - 1A thus diffuses in the PIP2 domains and forms large circular domains to minimize boundary energy 21 . Third , 6 - dodecanoyl - 2 - dimethylaminonaphthalene 22 ( laurdan ) showed that the PIP2 domains were highly hydrated , whereas the 20 – 1 . 5 20 1 . 5 20 – 1 . 5 20 – 1 . 5 – – – – – – 20 40 – 1 . 5 5 – 20 20 5 – D O PS ( % ) C h o l e s t e r o l ( % ) P I P 2 ( % ) 20 – – D i O S x T M H M e r g e Cross - section 10 μ m 6 5 4 8 10 1 2 7 3 9 C o n d i t i o n Figure 2 | Confocal microscopy of syntaxin - 1A domains in artificial membranes .

All rights reserved ©2011 cholesterol domains were much more densely packed ( Supplementary Fig . 7 ) . Fourth , phase contrast microscopy showed a thickening of the cholesterol - dependent clusters but not of the PIP2 - domains ( Sup - plementary Fig . 8 ) . Thus , even though no saturated lipids are present , the cholesterol - dependent domains have behaviour that resembles the liquid ordered phase . In contrast , the PIP2 domains seem much more disordered and resemble the liquid disordered phase . Ca 2 1 demixing of polyanionic amphiphiles showed that electrostatic interactions can indeed lead to liquid - like domains 21 . The transmembrane helix of syntaxin - 1A has been reported to homodimerize . However , introducing the Met267Ala , Cys271Ala and Ile279Ala mutations that prevent homodimerization of the syntaxin - 1A peptides 23 did not prevent cholesterol - or PIP2 - mediated clustering ( Supplementary Fig . 9 ) . By contrast , no PIP2 domains were observed whentwocharges ( Lys264AlaandLys265Ala ) fromthepolybasiclinker were removed , but cholesterol - dependent clusters were still observed ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . Overexpression of the C - terminal part of syntaxin - 1A fused to green fluorescent protein 24 in PC12 cells also showed 4 – 8 - fold loss of clustering of the Lys264Ala Lys265Ala mutant ( Supplementary Figs 10 and 11 ) . These data show that electrostatic interactions between PIP2 and the juxtamembrane helix of syntaxin - 1A are sufficient for domain formation . We then set out to investigate to what extent PIP2 is required for syntaxin - 1A clustering in PC12 cells . For this purpose , we expressed a red - fluorescent - protein - tagged construct containing the phosphatase domainofsynaptojanin - 1fusedtoaCAAXbox , resultinginitstargeting to the plasma membrane 7 . Synaptojanin - 1 is a polyphosphoinositide 5 - phosphatase , and theexpression oftheconstruct completelyremoved PIP2 from the plasma membrane 6 , 7 ( Supplementary Fig . 12 ) . Notably , synaptojanin - 1 expression reduced 3 . 7 - fold the punctuate distribution of endogenous syntaxin - 1A ( Fig . 3 and Supplementary Fig . 13 ) . Thus , this provides evidence that PIP2 is indeed required for at least part of syntaxin - 1A microdomain formation . We performed molecular dynamics simulations to gain insight into the precise conformation of the PIP2 / syntaxin - 1A microdomains . In these coarse - grained simulations , several atoms were represented by one simulation bead 25 , 26 ( Supplementary Fig . 14 ) . This allowed for simulations of relatively large lipid bilayers comprising , 2 , 500 copies of DOPC and DOPS in a 4 : 1 molar ratio and 40 – 64 copies of syntaxin - 1A 257 – 288 and PIP2 . In a simulation time of 10 m s , up to ten copies of syntaxin - 1A 257 – 288 clustered with PIP2 into microdomains ( Sup - plementary Fig . 15 ) . Equal amounts of PIP2 and syntaxin - 1A were present in the bulk phase of those domains , whereas more PIP2 and DOPS associated transiently to the periphery . We used this informa - tion to construct a domain with 64 copies of syntaxin - 1A ( Fig . 4 and Supplementary Movie 1 ) , which is comparable to the syntaxin - 1A content in the microdomains in PC12 cells 12 . These domains were stable over a simulation time of 6 m s and contained , 10 % residual DOPC or DOPS . We conclude that syntaxin - 1A and PIP2 can form dynamic , amorphous networks with PIP2 acting as a ‘charge bridge’ spanning the distance between the various syntaxin - 1A molecules ( Fig . 4c ) . Our findings show that electrostatic interactions between the mem - brane lipid PIP2 and the SNAP receptor syntaxin - 1A suffice to induce membrane sequestering and microdomain formation without the need for high local PIP2 production or a ( complex ) ‘molecular fence’ restricting PIP2 and protein diffusion 27 .

In fact , these seem essen - tial forsegregationof proteins with similar structures and sizes , such as syntaxin - 1Aandsyntaxin - 4 12 , 24 ( bothhavepolybasicregionsandcluster separately ) .

Second , the lipid environment modulates the energetic requirements for fusion 13 , 16 . Third , both PIP2 and syntaxin - 1A function as molecular docking sites and facilitate assembly of the complete fusion machinery 1 , 2 , 6 – 9 . Our findings that electrostatic protein – lipid interactions are sufficient for membrane sequestering indicate that such interactions constitute a mechanism for the formation of protein microdomains in the mem - brane that is clearly distinct from protein partitioning by means of the well - established lipid phases 18 , 29 .
