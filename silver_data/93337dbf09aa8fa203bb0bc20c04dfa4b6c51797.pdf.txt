Review Effects of COVID - 19 on cognition and brain health Sijia Zhao , 1 , * So ﬁ a Toniolo , 2 , 3 Adam Hampshire , 4 and Masud Husain 1 , 2 , 3 , * COVID - 19 is associated with a range of neurological , cognitive , and mental health symptoms both acutely and chronically that can persist for many months after infection in people with long - COVID syndrome . Investigations of cognitive function and neuroimaging have begun to elucidate the nature of some of these symptoms . They reveal that , although cognitive de ﬁ cits may be related to brain imaging abnormalities in some people , symptoms can also occur in the absence of objective cognitive de ﬁ cits or neuroimaging changes . Further - more , cognitive impairment may be detected even in asymptomatic individuals . We consider the evidence regarding symptoms , cognitive de ﬁ cits , and neuroim - aging , as well as their possible underlying mechanisms . Brain health and symptoms associated with COVID - 19 Early in the coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) , it was appreciated that there could be signi ﬁ cant effects of the infection on the brain [ 1 ] . Neurological syndromes were observed most commonly in hospitalised patients , including delirium , encephalopathy , and stroke [ 2 – 4 ] . An analysis of elec - tronic health records of > 236 000 people who had been infected with COVID - 19 showed that non - hospitalised patients also incurred a signi ﬁ cantly higher likelihood of developing psychiatric conditions , including altered mood , anxiety , insomnia , and psychosis [ 5 ] . The estimated incidence of receiving either a neurological or psychiatric diagnosis for the ﬁ rst time was 11 . 5 % in the ﬁ rst 6 months following infection , and this doubled among patients with intensive care unit ( ICU ) admission [ 5 ] . Importantly , these ﬁ gures cannot simply be ex - plained by systemic effects associated with any respiratory tract infection because the rates were signi ﬁ cantly higher compared to patients with in ﬂ uenza [ 5 , 6 ] . However , some studies found no difference between COVID - 19 and other respiratory tract infections with comparable disease acute illness severity [ 7 , 8 ] . Some of the elevated risks appear to be transient . After 1 – 3 months it has been reported that diagnostic rates for stroke , insomnia , and mood and anxiety disorders gradually return to levels comparable to those of patients with other respiratory tract infections [ 9 ] . Nevertheless , following the observation of the acute impact of COVID - 19 infec - tion on the brain , it soon became clear that there were also symptoms in the chronic phase [ 10 ] . Two years after infection , the risks of cognitive symptoms , dementia , and psychotic dis - orders were still signi ﬁ cantly elevated [ 9 ] . The prevalence and persistence of self - reported cognitive symptoms after COVID - 19 have been extensively reported , but the variability in estimates between studies is very large [ 11 – 14 ] . In a longitudinal study on 766 infected individuals , 36 % reported cognitive symptoms in the ﬁ rst 3 months following infection , and those with cognitive symptoms in the ﬁ rst month were twice as likely to report chronic symptoms at 3 months compared to those without such symptoms [ 15 ] . According to a recent meta - analysis of online surveys , one in ﬁ ve individuals who contracted Highlights EvenmonthsafterrecoveryfromCOVID - 19 infection , some people continue to experience neurological , psychiatric , and cognitive effects . Recent extensive research using elec - tronic health records , cognitive testing , and neuroimaging has started to clarify the nature of some of these symptoms . COVID - 19 offers an unprecedented op - portunity to follow individuals from acute infection through to the emergence of post - viral illness on a broad scale . 1 DepartmentofExperimentalPsychology , UniversityofOxford , OxfordOX26GG , UK 2 Nuffield Department of Clinical Neuro - sciences , John Radcliffe Hospital , Uni - versity of Oxford , Oxford OX3 9DU , UK 3 Wellcome Trust Centre for Integrative Neuroimaging , Department of Experi - mentalPsychology , University ofOxford , Oxford OX2 6AE , UK 4 Department of Brain Sciences , Imperial College London , 926 Sir Michael Uren Hub , 86 Wood Lane , London W12 0BZ , UK * Correspondence : sijia . zhao @ psy . ox . ac . uk ( S .

Trends in Cognitive Sciences OPEN ACCESS COVID > 3 months ago still continue to experience some degree of ' brain fog ' , including attention and memory problems [ 16 ] . These self - reported cognitive complaints are amongst the most common symptoms of the post - COVID condition ( PCC ) , also known as ' long COVID ' [ 17 ] . According to the World Health Orga - nization clinical case de ﬁ nition , PCC comprises a constellation of symptoms ( e . g . , cognitive dys - function , fatigue , shortness of breath ) that are still present 3 months after coronavirus infection , have lasted at least 2 months , affect daily functioning , and cannot be explained by another cause [ 18 ] . Given the heterogeneity of PCC symptoms , it has been proposed that PCC might not be a uni ﬁ ed condition and instead re ﬂ ects a group of distinct phenotypes [ 19 – 22 ] . Of symptomatic COVID - 19 patients , 2 . 2 % experienced chronic cognitive symptoms 3 months after infection , according to a meta - analysis of 1 . 2 million cases [ 22 ] . Recent estimates suggest that 1 . 7 million UK adults ( 2 . 7 % of the population ) had self - reported PCC in March 2023 , and 69 % had symptoms for > 1 year [ 23 ] . However , the prevalence of chronic cognitive symptoms could be overestimated in many studies . One study found the prevalence of cognitive symptoms was the same ( 70 % ) regardless of whether individuals had been infected or not [ 24 ] , highlighting potential dif ﬁ culties in interpreting the prevalence of symptoms . It is therefore crucial to consider data from studies that have objectively measured cognitive function rather than relying on self - report . Cognitive function in the acute phase Global , clinical cognitive screening tests were commonly used in the acute phase , namely within 3 months of infection [ 25 – 27 ] . For example , a comprehensive examination of 49 largely non - hospitalised COVID - 19 patients with an average age of 60 years showed lower scores on mini mental state examination ( MMSE ) compared to age - matched controls , and 53 % were signi ﬁ - cantly impaired in at least one cognitive domain ( attention and executive , memory , or visuospatial ) using a more extensive neuropsychological battery 2 – 3 months after infection [ 28 ] . This accords with a meta - analysis of 24 studies , all using cognitive screening tests , which reported that 52 % of patients overall demonstrated acute de ﬁ cits , and those aged over 59 years fared worse [ 26 ] . However , most of the publications in this analysis focused on hospitalised patients , namely those with more severe manifestations . Thus , there is likely to be a bias in patient selection . One might argue that surviving any critical illness can result in long - lasting cognitive impairment [ 29 ] , and this reported effect might therefore not be speci ﬁ c for SARS - CoV - 2 infection . To ad - dress this question , a case – control matched study [ 30 ] found that , compared to 60 ICU status - matched uninfected patients , 85 COVID patients had signi ﬁ cantly lower Montreal cognitive assessment ( MoCA ) scores at 6 months post - discharge , and more COVID - 19 patients scored below the cut - off for mild cognitive impairment . Some important limitations of conventional clinical screening tools are that they are relatively crude measures that may not be suf ﬁ ciently sensitive to detect mild cognitive de ﬁ cits . They also do not lend themselves to mass testing or longitudinal research owing to lack of different versions of tests ( to mitigate against practice effects ) and the need for face - to - face testing . During the pan - demic there was great interest in digital cognitive testing in which people complete computerised tests remotely . Hampshire et al . [ 31 ] reported data from 81 337 people who performed an online suite of cognitive tests . Of these , 12 689 people were veri ﬁ ed ( n = 518 ) or suspected to have COVID - 19 , and the majority had been infected 2 months previously . The authors found cognitive impairment scaled with acute COVID - 19 respiratory severity : hospitalised patients scored 0 . 25 – 0 . 45 standard deviations below the mean of the uninfected healthy group , whereas non - hospitalised patients showed a lesser but still signi ﬁ cant reduction in global cognitive score , Trends in Cognitive Sciences OPEN ACCESS 1054 Trends in Cognitive Sciences , November 2023 , Vol . 27 , No . 11 and this could not be attributed to premorbid intelligence or level of anxiety and depression symp - toms in the weeks before testing . Regardless of acute symptom severity , the most affected do - mains were semantic analogical reasoning ( e . g . , ' leaf is to branch ' as ' ﬁ nger is to arm ' ) and multi - stage planning ( measured by the Tower of London test ) . Box 1 overviews de ﬁ cits in cogni - tive functions , such as executive function and memory , in the acute phase of COVID - 19 . Other investigations also report that the severity of cognitive impairment depends on the level of medical assistance needed during the acute SARS - CoV - 2 infection [ 31 , 32 ] , especially if intensive care and oxygen support were required [ 28 ] . However , the length of hospitalisation has been shown not to be related to the acute cognitive de ﬁ cit [ 33 , 34 ] . The association with acute symp - tom severity has also been reported to be particularly strong in executive dysfunction ; one study objectively measured this using the number symbol coding task and found a correlation with an index of acute respiratory distress [ 28 ] . Cognitive function in the chronic phase Some COVID - 19 survivors may have attention , executive function , and memory de ﬁ cits for > 3 months [ 28 , 35 – 45 ] , and potentially up to 2 years if they have ongoing symptoms [ 46 ] . The prev - alence of chronic cognitive impairment remains unclear among the infected population [ 16 , 47 – 49 ] . Importantly , despite the fact that cognitive functions are measured independently , cognitive impairment in multiple domains is more common than in a single domain [ 28 , 38 , 50 ] . Overall , the objective testing data indicate that , for the majority of mild - to - moderately infected in - dividuals , recovery occurs within the ﬁ rst year after infection ( Box 2 for the persistence of chronic cognitive impairment ) ; however , some may experience some degree of cognitive de ﬁ cit beyond 1 year , similar to the trajectory of self - reported PCC symptoms [ 51 ] . The presence of ongoing symptoms may also be a key factor : a digital testing study that tracked 101 self - reported PCC patients for 9 months found no sign of recovery in cognition over this time , and cognitive impair - ment was still evident even 2 years after infection [ 46 ] . Vigilance and sustained attention In one study on 73 diagnosed PCC patients , ~ 50 % showed signi ﬁ cant impairment in detecting targets on a simple visual task [ 41 ] . This is consistent with the fact that concentration dif ﬁ culty is among the most reported post - COVID cognitive symptoms [ 23 , 52 ] . However , this attentional de ﬁ cit is not only limited to people with ongoing cognitive symptoms but is also present in young individuals without subjective complaints [ 36 ] . An online testing study [ 36 ] showed that 53 young individuals who had COVID - 19 5 months ago and reported no cognitive symptoms scored signi ﬁ cantly worse on a vigilance test ( Figure 1A ) . After only 3 min , the COVID - 19 group Box 1 . Executive dysfunction and memory de ﬁ cit in the acute phase Executive dysfunction is a commonly reported effect in the acute stage , especially in patients over 60 years of age with moderatetosevereacutesymptoms [ 33 , 74 , 124 ] . However , ithasbeendif ﬁ culttodeterminethefrequencyandmagnitude ofacuteexecutivedysfunctionbecausedifferenttasksandmeasureshavebeendeployed . Themostcommontestusedis the trail - making task ( TMT ) . Impairment on this task has been frequently reported in the acute phase , especially among people over 50 years of age who had moderate to severe respiratory symptoms [ 53 , 125 ] or cognitive symptoms [ 126 ] , but thisismuch lesscommon in youngnon - hospitalised cases [ 127 , 128 ] . However , pre - existingillnesses , such as diabe - tes , may alter the prevalence of cognitive symptoms [ 129 ] . More advanced executive functions , such as multi - stage plan - ning , may also be impaired in some individuals [ 31 ] . Infected people have also consistently demonstrated impairment in memory using standard screening tools as well as speci ﬁ c memory tasks such as free recall of wordlists and recall of drawing complex ﬁ gures [ 25 , 28 , 79 , 130 , 131 ] . Trends in Cognitive Sciences OPEN ACCESS Trends in Cognitive Sciences , November 2023 , Vol . 27 , No . 11 1055 showed a decrease in their ability to sustain attention to detect infrequent targets . The result was not due to a de ﬁ cit in target detection because in the same study the COVID - 19 group performed normally in the ﬁ rst 3 min of this attention task and also on tasks that focused on other forms of attention [ 36 ] . Box 2 . How long does chronic cognitive impairment persist after COVID - 19 ? Currently , outcomes differ considerably depending on the population assessed and the cognitive tests used , but in general , 1 year after infection , the majority of mild - to - moderately affected individuals would have a normal global score on cognitive screening tests . For instance , 9 months after infection , 443 primarily non - hospitalised individuals had normal mini - mental state examination ( MMSE ) scores [ 132 ] , and 4 months after infection , 98 % of 120 healthcare workers had a normalMMSEscore [ 55 ] . Individualsolderthan60years ( n = 1178 ) alsoshowednormalglobalcognitioncomparedtotheir uninfected spouses ( n = 438 ) 6 months post - infection , measured through telephone interview of cognitive status ( TICS ) [ 133 ] .

Examples of paradigms used in the literature to study the cognitive de ﬁ cits following COVID - 19 . ( A ) Vigilancetaskdesignedtoassessperformance decrement during sustained visual attention . A single digit was presented for 50 ms every second and participants were instructed to press spacebar when seeing ' 0 ' . Young COVID survivors without ongoing symptoms ( n = 53 , mean age = 28 , mean time from infections = 5 months ) showed a signi ﬁ cantly larger decrement in accuracy of detecting the target after 3 min compared to uninfected controls ( n = 83 , mean age = 29 ) . Adapted from [ 36 ] . ( B ) The trail - making task ( TMT ) part B requires participants to connect circles in a speci ﬁ ed order as quickly as possible , switching between numbers and letters . Completion time provides a measure of processing speed and cognitive ﬂ exibility . A total of 800 participants aged > 50 years completed this task before and after the breakout of COVID - 19 . Those who had contracted COVID - 19 ( n = 401 , mean time from infection = 5 months ) required a signi ﬁ cantly longer time to complete this task compared to uninfected controls . This suggests a de ﬁ cit in executive function that becomes worse with greater age . Adapted from [ 35 ] . ( C ) A total of 1706 participants who had COVID - 19 1 – 17 months previously and 3722 uninfected controls were asked to perform an object memory task . People > 25 years of age showed worse performance on this test compared to their age - matched uninfected controls . Adapted from [ 37 ] . In all plots , the shaded area shows 1 standard error . Trends in Cognitive Sciences OPEN ACCESS 1056 Trends in Cognitive Sciences , November 2023 , Vol . 27 , No . 11 Executive functions One study [ 49 ] found that 27 % of 200 hospitalised patients who had recovered from severe COVID - 19 still exhibited impairment in the trail - making task ( TMT ) at 7 months , consistent with other evidence [ 40 , 53 ] . In another study , among young patients who had ongoing symptoms for ~ 1 year , 15 % showed signi ﬁ cant impairment in the TMT , but this effect was on average smaller than in age - matched chronic fatigue syndrome ( CFS ) patients [ 41 ] . This effect also seems to be age - related [ 35 ] . A very well - controlled longitudinal study in the UK Biobank compared TMT per - formance in 800 people to their pre - pandemic performance [ 35 ] . Individuals who contracted COVID - 19 but recovered from acute symptoms took signi ﬁ cantly longer to complete the task compared to uninfected controls . This difference persisted even after all hospitalised participants were excluded , and was especially noticeable on the TMT - B in people aged > 60 years ( Figure 1B ) . However , the same individuals performed normally on a number - coding task which requires participants to match symbols to digits based on a key provided , demonstrating some speci ﬁ city of the TMT ﬁ nding . Investigations of younger people – regardless of acute symptom se - verity – have not found any chronic effects on TMT - B performance [ 54 ] or on other executive functions such as cognitive ﬂ exibility ( Wisconsin card sorting test [ 43 ] ) , multi - stage planning ( Tower of London ) [ 36 , 40 , 55 ] ) , and visuospatial mental rotation tasks [ 36 , 43 ] . In addition , working memory is also found to be affected in an online study of 1706 infected people , which also showed a strong association with age [ 37 ] ( Figure 1C ) . Episodic memory Episodic memory appears to be negatively impacted , irrespective of the types of stimuli to be remem - bered ( words or pictures ) [ 27 , 28 , 36 , 42 – 45 , 56 , 57 ] . These de ﬁ cits might be observed even in relatively young and mild cases without ongoing symptoms [ 36 ] . For example , in a computerised memory task withsimpleline drawingsof objects , 36 peoplein their 30swho had noongoing symptomsperformed normally on theimmediate recognition test , but 30 min later they forgot more information compared to the uninfected controls [ 36 ] . The error was caused by a loss of memory details ( e . g . , remembering that an object in the study set was a strawberry , but forgetting its exact appearance or orientation ) . Despite the small sample size , a strong correlation between this episodic memory de ﬁ cit and time since the onset of COVID - 19 acute symptoms was found in this young group [ 36 ] . Relation of symptoms to objective cognitive impairments The presence of ongoing cognitive symptoms has been shown to be a strong predictor of objective cognitive de ﬁ cits [ 37 , 43 , 46 , 58 ] . Based on a recent study , up to 2 years after infection , a moderate cognitive de ﬁ cit was still detectable in people experiencing PCC ( n = 1768 , median age = 58 ) , but not in those with perceived full recovery [ 46 ] . However , this association was absent in a slightly younger sample ( n = 319 , mean age = 49 ) [ 39 ] . Further , people without cognitive symptoms could also show a mild de ﬁ cit months after infection [ 36 ] . Risk factors for cognitive impairments are overviewed in Box 3 . Impact of vaccination Numerous studies have now demonstrated that vaccinated people have lower rates of chronic cog - nitive symptoms than unvaccinated individuals who became infected [ 59 – 61 ] ( reviewed in [ 62 ] ) , espe - cially if they were older [ 63 ] . However , to the best of our knowledge , no published research has made use of objective assessment , and therefore the impact of vaccines on the risk of developing new or changing existing chronic cognitive de ﬁ cits in COVID - 19 - infected individuals remains unknown . Mental health and relationship to cognition Sleep disturbance , anxiety , and mood disorders can have a major impact on cognitive complaints in people [ 64 ] . COVID - 19 has been linked to a high prevalence of all these symptoms Trends in Cognitive Sciences OPEN ACCESS Trends in Cognitive Sciences , November 2023 , Vol . 27 , No . 11 1057 [ 6 , 9 , 55 , 58 , 65 ] . However , the severity of these mental health symptoms has not consistently been shown to correlate with the degree of acute or chronic post - COVID cognitive de ﬁ cits in studies with objective testing [ 31 , 36 , 39 , 58 ] . One study suggests that , compared to acute severity or presence of comorbidities , the presence of depression was the factor which had the greatest in - ﬂ uence on cognitive performance [ 50 ] . Further , cognitive function and depression both had inde - pendent negative impacts on different aspects of self - reported quality of life , but in addition they also interacted signi ﬁ cantly to in ﬂ uence these important metrics of PCC ( Figure 2 ) . In another study of patients attending a dedicated PCC clinic on average 5 months after infection ( 22 % pre - viously hospitalised ) , the severity of depressive symptoms was signi ﬁ cantly associated with the Box 3 . Risk factors for chronic cognitive impairment What are the risk factors for delayed recovery or even progressive cognitive decline ? Severity of acute symptoms Acute COVID - 19 severity is the strongest risk factor for progressive cognitive decline over 1 year , followed by hyperten - sion , coronary heart disease , and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , according to a longitudinal study of 1458 in - fected patients older than 60 years [ 133 ] . As in the acute stage , the early chronic cognitive de ﬁ cit shows a relationship withacuteCOVID - 19severity [ 36 , 38 , 44 , 45 , 49 , 58 , 135 ] . Thecognitivede ﬁ citafter9months , however , istypicallyunrelated to acute COVID - 19 severity [ 37 , 43 ] , but this might vary in different age groups [ 133 ] . Acute symptoms Regarding speci ﬁ c symptoms , intriguingly , individuals with dysgeusia ( altered taste ) and hyposmia during the acute stage had less recovery of memory functions after infection compared to those without these symptoms [ 28 , 45 ] . Age Age also plays a role in chronic cognitive impairment after COVID - 19 [ 35 , 37 ] . However , the relationship between age and cognitive de ﬁ cits in COVID - 19 is far from linear because some evidence points towards worse performance in young and middle - aged adultscompared to older adults ( 50 – 64 years ) [ 37 , 136 ] . Currently , we cannotexcludethe possibility that dif - ferent mechanisms might underlie cognitive performance in different age groups . The literature on the impact of COVID - 19 on cognition in children and adolescents is less extensive , likely due to a com - bination of reduced detection rates of SARS - CoV - 2 , lower prevalence of cognitive complaints , and dif ﬁ culties in perform - ing objective cognitive testing [ 137 , 138 ] . The incidence rate for cognitive symptoms at 6 months after infection ( n = 185 748 ) was ~ 1 % in thispopulation , comparedto6 % inpersons > 65years ( n = 242101 ) [ 6 ] . Althoughpotentiallyreassuring , a lack of cognitive symptoms does not always indicate normal cognitive function , and this thereforerequires further inves - tigation . Olderadults ( > 65years ) areathigherriskofbeinggivenadiagnosisofdementia2yearsaftertheinitialinfectioncompared to younger adults [ 9 ] . However , this effect may also be partially explained by the unmasking of pre - existing ( undiagnosed ) neurodegenerative illnesses . Hospitalisation with evidence of acute infection has long been known to be associated with higher rates of dementia diagnosis , beyond SARS - CoV - 2 infection [ 139 ] . Pre - existing dementia People with pre - existing dementia have a higher likelihood of experiencing severe COVID - 19 ( indexed by increased rates of hospitalisation , ICU admission , or death ) [ 140 – 142 ] . A studyon 61 . 9million adultsusingelectronic healthrecordsin the USA reported that patients with dementia had a twofold increased risk of SARS - CoV - 2 infection [ 141 ] , and a 5 . 2 - fold higher mortality rate [ 142 ] compared to patients without dementia . These suggest a bidirectional effect of neurodegener - ative disease and SARS - CoV - 2 infection on health outcomes [ 87 ] . SARS - CoV - 2 variants Preliminary evidencesuggeststhat thespeci ﬁ c variantofSARS - CoV - 2 mayalso be an importantriskfactor . Self - reported post - COVID condition ( PCC ) symptoms are more common in individuals infected in the pre - omicron variant era [ 19 , 46 ] . Different variants ( wild - type , alpha , delta ) might be associated with distinct PCC symptom clusters ( n = 9804 ) [ 143 ] . No - ticeably , brain fog became more prevalent after infection with the delta variant than with the alpha variant [ 143 ] . However , evidence from objective testing remains limited [ 46 ] . Trends in Cognitive Sciences OPEN ACCESS 1058 Trends in Cognitive Sciences , November 2023 , Vol . 27 , No . 11 degree of cognitive impairment , and this was driven mainly by verbal ﬂ uency , attention , and de - layed recall de ﬁ cits [ 56 ] . Sleep concerns speci ﬁ cally predicted memory disturbance , whereas anxiety appeared to have no signi ﬁ cant impact on cognitive performance [ 56 ] , although a modest effect of anxiety on cognition has been reported in a smaller sample [ 40 ] . Despite these associations , the nature of such observational studies means that it is dif ﬁ cult to es - tablish causal , directional relationships between depression and cognitive function . Further , there is evidence that post - acute COVID - 19 cognitive impairment can occur regardless of mental health symptoms in all acute severity groups [ 34 , 36 , 66 ] . This is consistent with ﬁ ndings from elec - tronic health records : mental health symptoms such as anxiety and depression returned to nor - mal within 2 months , but cognitive symptoms increased for at least 2 years [ 6 ] . Clearly , depression may play a contributory role in impaired cognitive performance , but it is also possible that post - COVID cognitive de ﬁ cits and / or other mechanisms ( discussed below ) may induce de - pression . Similar issues have also been rehearsed previously in the context of CFS where the ev - idence does not point to a clear conclusion ( discussed in [ 67 ] ) . Neuroimaging Understanding the acute and long - term effect of COVID - 19 on brain structure might provide some insights into cognitive symptoms . We focus on evidence from the three most common di - agnostic methods used in the current post - COVID literature : magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , ﬂ uorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ( FDG - PET ) , and electroencephalography ( EEG ) . MRI Acutely , white matter abnormalities have frequently been reported in COVID - 19 patients , poten - tially secondary to micro - and macrovascular insults , infectious , in ﬂ ammatory , or autoimmune causes [ 68 – 71 ] . However , even in COVID - 19 patients admitted to hospital with acute neurolog - ical symptoms , MRI is normal in the majority [ 72 ] .

Effects of cognitive functions and depression on quality of life . Impairment on several cognitive domains ( left column ) had an impact on different aspects of quality of life ( right column ) , as did the presence of depression . Adapted from [ 50 ] . Trends in Cognitive Sciences OPEN ACCESS Trends in Cognitive Sciences , November 2023 , Vol . 27 , No . 11 1059 patients revealed a reduction of intra - and extra - axonal volumes and a signi ﬁ cant increase in the free water fraction , suggestive of vasogenic oedema , and this was highest in frontoparietal re - gions [ 73 ] . This type of oedema is often associated with increased permeability of the blood – brain barrier but is reversible . Another study on 58 hospitalised COVID - 19 patients found higher signal on susceptibility weighted imaging sequences in the thalamus and increased mean diffusiv - ity in both the thalamic radiation and sagittal stratum 2 – 3 months after disease onset [ 74 ] . Chronically , the best evidence for structural changes in the grey matter in patients with COVID - 19 comes from a large longitudinal UK Biobank study ( Figure 3 ) [ 35 ] . This examined 401 people who had already had a baseline scan before the pandemic , and compared them to 384 uninfected controls . This study revealed reduced cortical thickness in brain areas functionally correlated to primary olfactory cortex such as the left parahippocampal gyrus , bilateral orbitofrontal cortex ( OFC ) , anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC ) , temporal pole , insula , and supramarginal gyrus in those who had COVID - 19 [ 75 ] . That study also showed increased mean diffusivity changes in OFC , ACC , insula , and amygdala 5 months after infection [ 35 ] . One year after infection , one small inves - tigation ( n = 22 ) found that COVID - 19 patients had diffusion abnormalities in the genu of the cor - pus callosum , corona radiata , and superior longitudinal fasciculus , and the corpus callosum was especially affected in people who had been admitted to ICU [ 76 ] . One study on 84 COVID - 19 pa - tients with PCC at 1 year showed reduced hippocampal volumes , particularly in hospitalised pa - tients , and reported an association between hippocampal head volumes and cognitive performance across multiple tests [ 77 ] .

Trends in Cognitive Sciences OPEN ACCESS 1060 Trends in Cognitive Sciences , November 2023 , Vol . 27 , No . 11 An association between cognitive impairment and brain imaging has been found across different modalities . In a task - related functional MRI study , PCC patients showed greater brain activation overall when performing a demanding n - back memory task , and this increase in brain activation predicted the severity of the cognitive symptoms in the patients [ 77 ] . A recent multimodal MRI study on 86 PCC patients who on average were infected 11 months earlier ( 33 % previously hospitalised ) found reduced resting state functional connectivity between the left and right parahippocampal regions , as well as between bilateral OFC and the cerebellum , and functional connectivity changes in OFC were associated with memory performance [ 75 ] . Cognitive de ﬁ cits in - cluding in executive functions were also found to be associated with grey matter atrophy in these areas [ 35 , 75 ] and white matter changes [ 28 , 71 , 73 ] . Besides single brain areas , the impact of mul - tiple white matter hyperintensities observed in some COVID - 19 patients can also contribute to their cognitive de ﬁ cits in executive functions , processing speed , and memory [ 28 ] . Moreover , mental health could also be related to abnormal imaging ﬁ ndings in these patients . An investigation of 42 patients who were hospitalised with COVID reported that , at 3 months , severity of depression was correlated with atrophy in ACC , whereas post - traumatic symptoms were related to ACC and insular volumes ; both symptoms were associated with white matter microstructural damage in several tracts and with in ﬂ ammatory markers in blood [ 78 ] . These neuroimaging ﬁ ndings echo the aforementioned complex associations between mental health symptoms and cognition . FDG - PET A pattern of frontoparietal hypometabolism on FDG - PET has consistently been reported in COVID - 19 patients presenting with acute neurological symptoms [ 79 – 83 ] . Cross - sectional data in the chronic phase as well as longitudinal analysis show that this tends to resolve over time , and there was minimal or absent residual hypometabolism after ~ 6 months [ 54 , 81 – 83 ] . Other areas that have been found to be involved include the thalamus , insula , and medial temporal lobe including the parahippocampal gyrus [ 84 – 86 ] . The cerebellum , pons , and brainstem have shown either hyper - [ 79 – 82 ] or hypometabolism [ 85 , 86 ] . Children have been found to show a similar pattern of hypometabolism to adults [ 86 ] . The prominent involvement of a frontoparietal network in FDG - PET imaging would be consistent with impairments in attention and executive function reported in these patients [ 87 , 88 ] . Overall , the ﬁ ndings from both MRI and FDG - PET show there can be an association between im - aging abnormalities and cognitive function [ 28 , 35 , 73 , 75 , 79 ] . The true prevalence of brain imaging abnormalities in people with previous COVID - 19 infection is unknown , but it remains the case that brain imaging is normal in most people with available brain imaging data with past COVID - 19 infection , including PCC . EEG Individuals with normal MRI scans may still have aberrant cortical activity [ 28 , 89 ] . EEG abnormal - ities , including generalised slowing and epileptiform discharges , particularly in the frontal region , are common in individuals after SARS - CoV - 2 infection [ 89 – 91 ] . According to two meta - analyses on 617 and 308 patients conducted early in the pandemic , COVID - 19 patients can ex - hibit abnormal background activity in up to 96 . 1 % of cases [ 91 ] , and ~ 68 . 6 % have diffuse slowing [ 90 ] , whereas epileptiform discharges were less common ( 20 . 3 – 22 . 3 % ) . Importantly , electrographic seizures , unlike clinical seizures , in COVID - 19 patients have been found to be sig - ni ﬁ cantly associated with mortality in one study [ 92 ] . Although EEG abnormalities have been doc - umented in patients without pre - existing neurological conditions [ 89 , 92 ] , epileptiform discharges are increased in patients with pre - existing epilepsy [ 90 ] . COVID - 19 - related encephalopathy is often the major indication for performing EEG , and is asso - ciated with higher rates of abnormal ﬁ ndings , and frontal EEG abnormalities have been proposed Trends in Cognitive Sciences OPEN ACCESS Trends in Cognitive Sciences , November 2023 , Vol . 27 , No . 11 1061 as a marker of COVID - 19 - related encephalopathy [ 89 – 91 ] . Some studies found no link between EEG abnormalities and cognitive dysfunction [ 89 ] , whereas others found an association with performance during tests measuring frontal functions such as the frontal assessment battery and the TMT [ 28 ] . However , one longitudinal investigation at 10 months reported that these changes normalised over time [ 28 ] . Possible mechanisms Several different mechanisms , by no means mutually exclusive , have been hypothesised to ac - count for COVID - associated cognitive impairment and changes in brain health , both in the acute and chronic phases of the disease . Cerebrovascular factors MRI scans on COVID - 19 patients who showed cognitive de ﬁ cits or neurological symptoms indi - cated a high prevalence of cerebrovascular abnormalities , including ischaemic strokes , intracra - nial haemorrhage , and cerebral microbleeds , which could contribute to cognitive de ﬁ cits [ 68 , 69 , 72 , 93 – 99 ] . Damage to the blood vessel endothelium in acute COVID - 19 infection is asso - ciated with a prothrombotic state which results in micro - and macro - thrombus formation [ 100 ] . Worse clinical outcomes are reported in patients with pre - existing endothelial dysfunction , such as patients with systemic hypertension , diabetes , or obesity [ 101 ] . The initial trigger could be direct viral invasion of endothelial cells or indirect in ﬂ ammatory effects . The exposure of the subendothelium triggers the coagulation cascade and subsequent platelet activation , leading to thrombus formation , which ultimately leads to hypoxia and cell damage [ 102 ] . The presence of hypoxic – ischemic lesions has been found to correlate with neurological manifestations of COVID - 19 in a large meta - analysis of 45 autopsy studies [ 103 ] . This procoagulatory state then activates increased production of proin ﬂ ammatory cytokines including interleukin 6 ( IL - 6 ) , IL - 1 , IL - 10 , and tumour necrosis factor α ( TNF - α ) . This contributes to disruption of the blood – brain bar - rier , which in turn increases migration of monocytes from outside the brain and reinforces a pro - in ﬂ ammatory state [ 104 ] . Age has been found to be the single most important factor in neuropathology associated with hypoxic and ischemic lesions and reactive neuroin ﬂ ammation [ 103 ] . Dysregulated autoimmunity and neuroin ﬂ ammation SARS - CoV - 2 infection triggers the release of immune mediators in the blood which can manifest as a ' cytokine storm ' of elevated levels of proin ﬂ ammatory cytokines . Cytokine levels correlate positively with acute COVID - 19 systemic severity [ 105 – 107 ] , and might contribute to neurological complications such as encephalopathy [ 108 ] . High levels of cytokines in the blood can also in - crease blood – brain barrier permeability , leading to increased migration of in ﬂ ammatory cells into the brain [ 104 ] . Neuroin ﬂ ammation has been consistently reported in animal and human studies at autopsy [ 103 , 109 ] . Heightened neuroin ﬂ ammation in the hippocampus has also been found to be linked to reduced hippocampal neurogenesis in mouse and hamster models of COVID - 19 , and also in human samples [ 109 , 110 ] . Recently , a study using translocator protein ( TSPO ) PET reported higher distribution volume ( TSPO V T , an index of in ﬂ ammatory change ) in 20 patients with depressive and cognitive symptoms after recovering from mild or moderate COVID - 19 compared to 20 uninfected controls , and this was particularly notable in the dorsal putamen and ventral striatum [ 111 ] . Higher levels of TSPO V T in the dorsal putamen were strongly associ - ated with slower ﬁ nger - tapping speed [ 111 ] . However , increased neuroin ﬂ ammation is also found in mice and humans after mild in ﬂ uenza , and most cytokines normalise over time in animal models [ 109 , 110 ] . Reactive microglia and astroglial cells together with in ﬂ ammatory in ﬁ ltrates represent the most common ﬁ ndings and are found in Trends in Cognitive Sciences OPEN ACCESS 1062 Trends in Cognitive Sciences , November 2023 , Vol . 27 , No . 11 44 – 52 % of COVID - 19 cases at autopsy , and they are present regardless of detection of viral RNA , pointing towards a general in ﬂ ammatory response rather than a consequence of the virus per se [ 103 ] . Only in ﬂ ammatory in ﬁ ltrates seem to be associated with rates of neurological symptoms [ 103 ] . The neuroin ﬂ ammatory marker glial acid ﬁ brillary protein ( GFAP ) has been found to be increased in the acute phase of COVID - 19 [ 112 , 113 ] but , according to one study on 175 COVID - 19 patients and 45 patients with in ﬂ uenza , levels return to their normal baseline 3 months after infection , and importantly are not different compared to samples with in ﬂ uenza [ 113 ] . Another study on 100 COVID - 19 patients at 6 months con ﬁ rmed that GFAP levels as well as initial increases in neuro ﬁ lament light chain ( NfL ) tended to normalise over time [ 114 ] . How - ever , one cross - sectional study on 84 patients with PCC symptoms at 1 year showed an inverse relationship between in ﬂ ammatory cytokines such as CCL11 and time after COVID - 19 infection , whereas other markers such as GFAP and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein ( MOG ) did now show such an association [ 77 ] . In the same study , increased levels of GFAP and MOG were as - sociated with higher volumes of several hippocampal sub ﬁ elds , unlike CCL11 and NfL which showed the opposite relationship . Therefore , although there is strong evidence to suggest that COVID - 19 in the acute phase is related to neuroin ﬂ ammation , more longitudinal data across dif - ferent modalities will be necessary to determine whether these effects are long - standing and whether having chronic PCC symptoms affects the return to baseline of these biomarkers . Direct viral invasion SARS - CoV - 2 uses its spike protein to bind to angiotensin - converting enzyme ( ACE ) 2 receptors , which are found on the surface of cells in many organs including the lungs , heart , blood vessels , kidneys , liver , and gastrointestinal tract [ 115 ] . Although ACE2 receptors are also present on en - dothelial cells in the brain , there is no substantial evidence that SARS - CoV - 2 infects neurons di - rectly . SARS - CoV - 2 might enter the brain via the olfactory bulb , where SARS - CoV - 2 protein has been found in brain vascular endothelium [ 116 ] . There is little evidence for the presence of SARS - CoV - 2 viral RNA in the cerebrospinal ﬂ uid of living patients [ 117 , 118 ] . The low detection rates of SARS - CoV - 2 viral RNA and proteins in the brain tissue of patients who died acutely from COVID - 19 suggest possible viral contamination during autopsy or detection of haematogenous viral RNA [ 100 , 102 , 103 , 116 , 119 , 120 ] . Moreover , there is no difference in detection rate of the virus in brain tissue between patients with and without neurological symptoms [ 103 ] . These ﬁ ndings indicate that viral invasion of the brain is unlikely to be responsible for long - term symptoms . Psychological impacts Psychological responses to illness are well - studied phenomena , although there is great variation in the way different people deploy strategies to cope with the stress of illness [ 121 ] . People who are depressed or anxious can show evidence of cognitive impairment [ 122 ] . A large international survey of factors associated with psychiatric outcomes compared PCC patients ( n = 5638 ) to in - dividuals who had recovered from COVID - related symptoms ( n = 475 ) [ 123 ] . Although PCC pa - tients had a higher mental health burden , the majority ( 57 % ) did not report experiencing depression , anxiety , or suicidality . Indeed , there was also no evidence in this study of maladaptive coping in the PCC group . Nevertheless , it is also clear , from this and the reports discussed in sec - tions above , that many people with PCC have mental health symptoms which are also associated with impaired cognition , although the direction of causality remains to be established . Concluding remarks COVID - 19 infection can have a negative impact on brain health and cognition in some individuals , both acutely and months after infection . We have presented data from a range of studies using electronic health records , community - based surveys , cognitive assessments , and neuroimaging that reveal both the complexity and limitations of current knowledge in this area . The known risks Trends in Cognitive Sciences OPEN ACCESS Trends in Cognitive Sciences , November 2023 , Vol . 27 , No . 11 1063 Outstanding questions Which cognitive de ﬁ cits contribute to the symptom of ' brain fog ' ? Which risk variables contribute to the frequency and degree of the post - COVID chronic cognitive de ﬁ cit at an individual level ? There is a pressing need for large - sample , interdisciplinary investigations . Do the affected cognitive functions after COVID - 19 all recover eventually ? How is the recovery duration of mental healthsymptomsandcognitivede ﬁ cits affected by risk variables ? Which do - mains of cognition recover slowest ? How do the different impacts of COVID - 19 interact with each other ? For example , is the chronic cognitive de ﬁ cit associated with neuropsychiat - ric vulnerability ? Are post - COVID cognitive de ﬁ cits spe - ci ﬁ c to particular viral variants ? How many different subtypes of cognitiveproblems ( e . g . , differentclus - ters ) are there , and how do they differ in terms of underlying mechanisms ? What is the natural evolution of abnormalities seen at brain imaging , and what is their long - term impact on cognitive function ? of signi ﬁ cant acute and chronic effects on mental health and cognitive function were considered . Crucially , these impacts are not only limited to people who had severe symptoms of acute illness or those who experienced long COVID , and can also be evident in milder cases without ongoing symptoms . PCC continues to be a global public health concern . Persistent cognitive symptoms are common after a SARS - CoV - 2 infection . However , there are still many important questions regarding the long - term cognitive effects of COVID - 19 that have not been resolved ( see Outstanding questions ) . Understanding the underlying mechanisms is still in its infancy . It will rely on high - quality studies that integrate both self - reported symptoms and objective cognitive function test - ing , as well as speci ﬁ c variables such as virus variants , vaccination status , and pre - existing con - ditions . Answering these questions will be essential to help clinicians and policymakers design interventions to treat and possibly treat long - term effects on cognition and brain health .
