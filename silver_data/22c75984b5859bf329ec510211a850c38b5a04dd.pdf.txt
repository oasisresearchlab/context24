II . L ITERATURE R EVIEW Human - Computer Interaction ( HCI ) is a culmination of technology , psychology , design , and user experiences . In the initial stages , technologies were predominantly designed in consideration of technical constraints , compelling users to adapt accordingly . However , with the advent of personal computers , a transformative shift occurred , placing the user at the center of technological development . Consequently , in both Human - Computer Interaction ( HCI ) and User - Centered Design ( UCD ) , usability emerged as a central aspect in the design and development of effective systems [ 1 ] . One needs to comprehend the essential nature of dialogue , prototyping , and sketching , along with recognizing the iterative nature inherent in the design process [ 2 ] . University research plays a crucial role in HCI innovations [ 3 ] , and it is hoped that this paper also contributes to the advancement of the field . Historically , conducting user studies was expensive , prompting suggestions to use heuristic evaluations , checklists , and such scripted methodologies . But studies showed that HCI practitioners could only include around 9 subjects in usability evaluations due to cost constraints . However , cost - effectiveness studies indicated that 4 - 5 experimental subjects could identify majority ( 80 % ) of usability problems . This efficiency was further facilitated by the utilization of " quick and dirty " ethnography techniques [ 4 ] . In the contemporary landscape , industry trends indicate a notable shift towards increased involvement of start - ups and research bodies in conducting actual user interviews and interactions . This shift is often catalyzed by the substantial investments secured by these start - ups . While precise figures to support these observations may not be readily available , this trend is widely recognized within the industry . As we delve into the multidisciplinary nature of HCI , we are reminded of its deep roots and ever - evolving trends . HCI is applied across multiple domains , including Video Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Intelligent Data Communication Technologies and Internet of Things ( IDCIoT - 2024 ) IEEE Xplore Part Number : CFP24CV1 - ART ; ISBN : 979 - 8 - 3503 - 2753 - 3 979 - 8 - 3503 - 2753 - 3 / 24 / $ 31 . 00 ©2024 IEEE 1560 2024 2 nd I n t e r n a t i o n a l C o n f e r e n c e o n I n t e lli g e n t D a t a C o m m un i c a t i o n T e c hn o l o g i e s a nd I n t e r n e t o f T h i n g s ( I D C I o T ) | 979 - 8 - 3503 - 2753 - 3 / 2 4 / $ 31 . 00 © 2024 I EEE | D O I : 10 . 1109 / I D C I O T 59759 . 2024 . 10467635 Authorized licensed use limited to the terms of the applicable license agreement with IEEE .

In 1996 , notable releases in the tech industry included Hotmail and Microsoft Windows NT 4 . 0 . During this time , users had growing expectations for highly usable and intuitive interfaces . Surveys indicated that over 50 % of the design and programming effort on projects was devoted to the user interface component [ 6 ] . Usability is considered a prominent quality objective , representing the measure to which an application can be utilized by designated users to attain certain results with effectiveness , efficiency , and satisfaction [ 7 ] . Multimodal Human - Computer Interaction enhances both usability and accessibility [ 8 ] . HCI4D , or Human - Computer Interaction for Development , emphasizes the collaborative efforts of universities , government agencies , companies , and non - governmental organizations ( NGOs ) in leveraging Human - Computer Interaction for the advancement and benefit of developing nations [ 9 ] . Affect recognition contributes to creating interactions that feel like natural dialogues . The measurement of affect involves utilizing various indicators such as Neurological responses , Autonomic activity , Facial expressions , Voice , and more [ 10 ] . Moreover , [ 11 ] highlights the role of affect in HCI , emphasizing the significance of emotions in human - computer interactions by emphasizing the use of psychophysiological measures , including heart rate and facial expressions , for affect recognition . Understanding and responding to user emotions have become pivotal in crafting technology that resonates on an emotional level . Moreover , [ 12 ] delves into the historical evolution of HCI , tracing its roots from military systems to the ergonomic design of commercial computers . The landscape of HCI offers four distinct perspectives , namely , 1 ) the systems perspective ( regarding users as data - entry points ) , 2 ) the dialogue partner perspective ( viewing users and computers as conversational counterparts ) , 3 ) the medium perspective ( perceiving computers as communication channels ) , and 4 ) the tool perspective ( seeing computers as instruments for tasks ) [ 13 ] . we explore the intricacies of HCI through these lenses , highlighting its interdisciplinary nature , emotional dimensions , historical evolution , and diverse perspectives . HCI is a multidisciplinary field that draws upon various other fields such as human factors , ergonomics , cognitive psychology , behavioral psychology , psychometrics , systems engineering , and computer science [ 14 ] . HCI evolved as a discipline and a community in the early 1980s , due to the personal computing revolution and the wide usage of office computers [ 15 ] . The research - practice gap is addressed by applying theoretical concepts into practical scenarios . For instance , the trajectories , an HCI conceptual framework derived from studies of mixed - reality performances , was employed in real - world settings such as music fests and running races . The emphasis is on action research methodologies such as Children - oriented Technology - Enhanced Learning ( TEL ) systems contribute to the education sector by leveraging technology . For example : E - books [ 16 ] . Fig 1 : Foundational Phase HCI is not just about technological advancement ; it embodies a moral and ethical responsibility to create technology that is accessible to all , fostering an inclusive digital landscape with the help of assistive technologies such as Screen Keyboard , Predictive Dictionary , and Speech Recognition [ 17 ] . The role of psychology and HCI studies in the process of shaping system design by analyzing user behavior by considering reactions , user preferences , accepting verbal protocols from the users to understand how they view the application , etc .

One section utilized web lectures , while the other adhered to traditional lecture methods . The grades from the web lecture section exhibited a noteworthy increase compared to the traditional lecture section , emphasizing the effectiveness of web - based instructional delivery [ 19 ] . This research becomes instrumental for educators and institutions striving to enrich the learning experiences . Fig 2 : Action - research Phase It is critical for the creation of technology that is not only user - friendly but is also efficient in terms of Functionality , Usability , Completeness , Extensibility , Integration , etc . [ 20 ] Recognizing emotions from facial expressions poses a challenge , particularly with target - based approaches ( utilizing static images ) . In contrast , facial gesture tracking ( sequence of images based on time ) , has demonstrated promising results [ 21 ] . This allows systems to not only comprehend but also respond to users ' emotional states , facilitating more empathetic and personalized interactions . The exploration of the relationships between people and technology involved the analysis of two distinct technologies : film and cell phones . The findings revealed that cell phones enable the capture of the intimacy of interpersonal relations while individuals are in transit within public spaces . 28 % of adolescents and 26 % of individuals aged 18 – 24 reported engaging in making and receiving intimate calls on their cell phones [ 22 ] . Empathizing with one ' s behavioral cues , particularly emotional states , heavily depends on interpreting facial expressions . However , the capabilities of current facial affect analyzers are somewhat restricted . Despite this , automated systems displayed an accuracy range of 64 % to 98 % when working on 3 - 7 deliberately displayed emotions by 5 - 40 users [ 23 ] . One notable limitation lies in their ability to identify only the six basic emotions . The concept of optimal flow within the context of HCI is central in this reference . The research investigates the relationship between task characteristics and the experiences of users during interactions with technology [ 24 ] . It brings into focus the idea of optimal flow , which underscores the significance of designing tasks that are not only engaging but also immersive , providing users with a sense of flow - like experiences by reducing the effective time taken to perform an operation . The proposed extended Human - centered AI ( HAI ) framework places emphasis on three key pillars : Ethically Aligned Design ( This aspect ensures that AI is not intended to wholly replace humans but rather complement and extend existing human capabilities . ) , Reflective Technology , and Human Factors Design [ 25 ] . Humans must be able to control intelligent systems in each setting at any point in time conveniently . For example , allowing the drivers of autonomous cars to readily take control of the car under emergency situations will prevent unexpected accidents . Personalization is pivotal in HCI , contributing significantly to user retention and fostering a sense of possessiveness towards an app . This holds true across various domains such as online advertising , e - commerce , and news platforms . Notably , field tests revealed a noteworthy increase of approximately 35 % in Click - Through Rates ( CTR ) when personalized recommendations are made as compared to simpler , popularity - based techniques [ 26 ] . Currently , AR technology is experiencing significant growth , emphasizing the importance for designers to delve into spatial design . In the realm of education , leveraging AR to enhance interactivity through Human - Computer Interaction ( HCI ) , particularly employing hand gesture recognition , becomes crucial . During testing , the ' Up ' gesture had the highest correct recognition rate at 87 % , whereas ' Forward ' and ' Click ' showed the least correct recognition rates at 61 % , each tested 100 times [ 27 ] . Figures ( Fig 1 , Fig 2 , Fig 3 ) showcase the timeline of major happenings in the field of HCI . It is divided into three phases , namely , the Foundational Phase ( the early days of HCI ) , the Action - research Phase ( a phase when both research work and practical implementation were going on Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Intelligent Data Communication Technologies and Internet of Things ( IDCIoT - 2024 ) IEEE Xplore Part Number : CFP24CV1 - ART ; ISBN : 979 - 8 - 3503 - 2753 - 3 979 - 8 - 3503 - 2753 - 3 / 24 / $ 31 . 00 ©2024 IEEE 1562 Authorized licensed use limited to the terms of the applicable license agreement with IEEE .

O BSERVATIONS AND F INDINGS Multimodal interfaces contribute to inclusive and accessible design for individuals with disabilities . However , the current state of multimodal technologies , such as facial recognition and speech recognition , has its own shortcomings . For instance , facial recognition is limited to detecting only six basic emotions , despite its decent overall performance . Similarly , comparing the efficiency of different vocal affect analyzers can be challenging . This difficulty arises from the use of isolated and small databases of speech material by each research community , making direct comparisons less straightforward [ 23 ] . This issue can be solved by creating a standardized and larger database for vocal affect analysis . Thanks to the multidisciplinary nature of HCI , it finds applications across various domains , particularly in Ed - Tech and E - commerce . In these fields , HCI has played a pivotal role in identifying efficient teaching methodologies , such as the use of web lectures , which demonstrated an increase in students ' performance . Similarly , in E - commerce , HCI has contributed to enhancing user engagement through gamification and other relevant techniques , leading to a significant boost in CTR by 35 % . Currently , there is a growing emphasis on the integrated utilization of Human - Computer Interaction ( HCI ) with Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) , Augmented Reality ( AR ) , and media to bring benefits to diverse industries such as healthcare , Ed - Tech , and fashion . However , concerns exist about the potential misuse of AI and apprehensions regarding its role in replacing humans , a reassuring development in this direction is the emergence of Human - Centered AI ( HAI ) . HAI promotes ethical practices , ensuring that technology serves to benefit the human race rather than replace it . IV . C ONCLUSION In conclusion , it ' s crucial to recognize that Human - Computer Interaction ( HCI ) has evolved into a distinct discipline , although it continues to play a complementary role in other fields . Currently , there is a predominant emphasis on applying existing HCI knowledge , especially in the fields of Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) and Augmented Reality ( AR ) . While ongoing research persists at both university and industry levels , paramount importance should be placed on User Experience ( UX ) and User Interface ( UI ) designs , with a commitment to keeping the user at the center of development .
