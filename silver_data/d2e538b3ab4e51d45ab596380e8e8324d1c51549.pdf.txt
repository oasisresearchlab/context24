A RT I C L E S Cell - sized spherical conﬁnement induces the spontaneous formation of contractile actomyosin rings in vitro Makito Miyazaki 1 , Masataka Chiba 1 , Hiroki Eguchi 1 , Takashi Ohki 1 and Shin’ichi Ishiwata 1 , 2 , 3 During cell division , many animal cells transform into a spherical shape and assemble a contractile ring composed of actin ﬁlaments and myosin motors at the equator to separate the cell body into two . Although actomyosin regulatory proteins are spatio - temporally controlled during cytokinesis , the direct contribution of cell shape and actomyosin activity to the contractile ring assembly remains unclear . Here , we demonstrated in vitro that actin polymerization inside cell - sized spherical droplets induced the spontaneous formation of single ring - shaped actin bundles in the presence of bundling factors . Despite a lack of spatial regulatory signals , the rings always assembled at the equator to minimize the elastic energy of the bundles . Myosin promoted ring formation by the dynamic remodelling of actin networks , and an increase in the effective concentration of myosin triggered ring contraction . These results will help us understand how animal cells coordinate cell shape and actomyosin activities to direct cytokinesis . How a contractile ring assembles and contracts is a central question in cytokinesis . Although the assembly mechanism is not fully understood , the following local actomyosin activation mechanism is generally accepted 1 – 4 . First , signals from astral microtubules and the central spindle localize active RhoA around the cell division plane , which activates formin 5 and myosin II ( ref . 6 ) . Formin stimulates the rapid polymerization of actin filaments 7 . These filaments are crosslinkedbymyosinandseveraldiﬀerenttypesofpassivecrosslinker including α - actinin 8 – 11 , anillin 12 and septin 13 , 14 , resulting in the formation of thick actomyosin bundles at the equator . As myosin generates contractile force 15 , it was naturally expected that the activation of myosin triggers ring contraction ; however , little is known about the mechanisms that regulate contraction . Moreover , time - lapse observations of GFP - labelled myosin in NRK cells 16 and a comparison with fission yeast 11 , 17 suggested the active involvement of myosin in contractile ring assembly 3 . However , the direct contribution of myosin to contractile ring assembly remains unclear because several tens of proteins are incorporated into the ring , many of which are also spatio - temporally regulated 1 – 4 . Recent in vitro experiments revealed that actin filaments in a pure solution formed ordered structures when they were confined in a cell - sized space 18 , 19 . In a rectangular confined space , actin filaments tended to orient along the long axis because they serve as elastic rods in a micrometre - sized space ; therefore , they were forced to orient parallel to each other to reduce the bending energy 18 . In a spherical confined space , actin filaments localized near the boundary and formed a cortex - like structure , which was also due to their structural rigidity 19 . These studies strongly suggest that the physical boundary of cells might contribute to the contractile ring assembly . Indeed , many adherent cells 20 – 23 and epithelial cells 24 – 26 transform into a spherical shape at mitosis , but the roles of the mitotic cell rounding are less understood . In this study , we investigated how actomyosin activity and cell shape could directly regulate contractile ring assembly and contraction . To this end , we adopted a simple in vitro model composed of purified proteins ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) and cell - sized water - in - oil droplets 19 , 27 , 28 . This bottom - up approach enabled the precise and independent control of biochemical parameters and the physical boundaries . Therefore , the eﬀects of actin polymerization activity , myosin motor activity , actin - crosslinking proteins , and the size and geometry of the confined space on the self - organized cytoskeletal networks could be identified systematically . RESULTS Actin polymerization inside cell - sized spherical droplets induces the spontaneous formation of actin rings To begin with , we examined the eﬀect of actin polymerization activity and cell - sized confinement in the absence of myosin 1 Department of Physics , Faculty of Science and Engineering , Waseda University , 3 - 4 - 1 Okubo , Shinjuku - ku , Tokyo 169 - 8555 , Japan . 2 Waseda Bioscience Research Institute in Singapore ( WABIOS ) , 11 Biopolis Way , # 05 - 01 / 02 Helios , Singapore 138667 , Singapore . 3 Correspondence should be addressed to S .

( a ) The mechanism of actin bundling by the depletion effect . Macromolecules such as methylcellulose are excluded from the surface of actin ﬁlaments ( yellow region ) . This depletion volume leads to an attractive force between actin ﬁlaments because the reduction in depletion volume increases the entropy , which lowers the total free energy of the system 29 .

White dashed lines indicate the droplet peripheries . Yellow arrows indicate the droplets in which an actin ring was self - assembled successfully . To visualize the actin ﬁlaments , 5 % ( mol / mol ) Alexa Fluor 546 – phalloidin was added at the initiation of actin polymerization . This amount of phalloidin did not alter the actin polymerization dynamics ( Supplementary Fig . 2e ) . We performed more than three independent experiments and conﬁrmed the repeatability . Actin , 10 µ M ; scale bars , 20 µ m . ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . We first modelled actin bundling using the depletion eﬀect of methylcellulose 29 – 31 instead of crosslinking proteins for simplicity ( Fig . 1a ) . Actin monomers were mixed with high - salt buﬀer containing methylcellulose , and the actin polymerization reaction was initiated . Methylcellulose induced attractive interactions between elongating actin filaments , resulting in the formation of bundled actin networks ( Fig . 1c and Supplementary Video 1 ) . When the same actin solution was encapsulated into spherical water - in - oil droplets with mean diameters of 4 . 77 µ m ( Supplementary Fig . 2a ) and actin polymerization was initialized ( Fig . 1b ) , ring - shaped actin bundles spontaneously assembled at the inner peripheries ( Fig . 1d and Supplementary Fig . 2b , c and Supplementary Video 2 ) . Time - lapse microscopy ( Fig . 2a and Supplementary Video 3 ) showed that the proportion of droplets containing a single and uni - formactinringincreasedmonotonicallyaftertheinitializationofactin polymerization until it reached a steady level . This time course was similar to that of actin polymerization in solution with a short time lag ( Fig . 2b ) , suggesting that actin polymerization was essential for successful ring assembly . Consistently , actin rings assembled rarely ( < 10 % of the droplets ; Supplementary Table 1 ) when actin was poly - merized before encapsulation . Actin rings always assembled at the droplet equator irrespective of droplet size and actin concentration ( Fig . 2c ) . During the initial step of ring formation , a single actin filament or a thin bundle of actin filaments were localized near the equator ( Fig . 2a and Supplementary Video 3 ) . This seemed to function as a seed for the ring assembly . The ring formation probability decreased monotonically with increasing the droplet diameter R droplet , and dropped to zero at R droplet = 15 µ m ( Fig . 2d solid lines ) . This was consistent with the persistence length L p ( 5 – 18 µ m ) of single actin filaments 32 – 35 . Therefore , the assembly of actin rings at the equator and the existence of a critical droplet diameter R droplet ∗ above which ring formation was inhibited led to the subsequent confinement - induced ring assembly mechanism ( Fig . 2e ) . Successful ring formation required that R droplet was nearly equal to or smaller than L p , which allowed the polymerizing actin filaments to behave like elastic rods , thus resulting in their localization at the equator to minimize their curvature . This initial localization of actin filaments at the equator induced the spontaneous bundling of elongating actin filaments , resulting in the formation of actin rings at the inner periphery . The actin rings oriented at random because the spherical droplet is point symmetrical ( Fig . 2f ) . When the droplet is compressed , the confinement - induced assembly mechanism predicts that the ring NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 17 | NUMBER 4 | APRIL 2015 481 © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

Myosin promotes ring formation by the dynamic remodelling of actin networks We next investigated the contribution of myosin to contractile ring assembly ( Supplementary Table 1 ) .

The contraction probability was deﬁned as the total number of ring - contracted droplets divided by the total number of ring - assembled droplets . The contraction magnitude was deﬁned as the mean value of the ratio R ring / R droplet among the rings that exhibited weak or strong contraction . We performed three independent experiments and the mean values were plotted . Error bars indicate s . d . of n = 3 independent experiments . Raw data are provided in Supplementary Table 1 . ( e ) Schematic illustration presenting the deﬁnition of the effective concentration of double - headed myosin . ( f ) Schematic illustration summarizing the entire process of actin ring dynamics assembled with myosin II - HMM and methylcellulose . Step 1 : Actin polymerization inside cell - sized spherical droplets induces the spontaneous formation of actin bundles at the inner peripheries . Step 2 : Myosin motors induce the dynamic rearrangement of actin bundles , which optimizes the actin networks into single ring - shaped bundles . Step 3 : A spontaneous increase in the density of myosin motors on actin bundles , which is referred to as the ‘myosin effective concentration’ , induces contraction of the actin rings . Step 4 : A further increase in the myosin effective concentration triggers fast and strong contraction . Step 5 : Contracted rings are disassembled by myosin . a steady phase ( within 30min ; see Fig . 2b ) , HMM was expected to play a dominant role in ring formation . During this later phase , the dynamiccoalescenceofzipper - likeactinbundleswasobserved ( Fig . 3e yellow arrowheads , Supplementary Video 4 ) , which did not occur in theabsenceofHMM ( SupplementaryVideo5 ) . WithincreasingHMM concentrations , the upper limit of the ring assembly time showed a linear correlation with R droplet ( Fig . 3f ) . This linear relationship suggested that ring formation was promoted by the ‘active diﬀusion’ of actin filaments driven by HMM , because single HMM could bind to two anti - parallel filaments simultaneously and translocate these two filaments in opposite directions 30 . This directional transportation induced the long - range rearrangement of actin networks , which might assist in overcoming trapped metastable structures and optimizing actin networks into a stable ring structure . Therefore , it is reasonable that , athighHMMconcentrations , themaximumtimerequiredforthe ring assembly was proportional to the equatorial length of the droplet ( = π R droplet ; Fig . 3f ) . The rigor and ADP states of HMM prohibited ring formation ( Fig . 3a , b and Supplementary Fig . 2e – g ) . In both states , the motor heads bind tightly to actin filaments 37 , 38 and HMM serves as a rigid crosslinker . The thermal diﬀusion of actin filaments was suppressed ( Supplementary Videos 6 and 7 ) and thus it prevented ring formation . A single - headed fragment of myosin II ( subfragment - 1 , or S - 1 ) did not aﬀect the ring formation probability ( Fig . 3a and Supplementary Fig . 2g ) , which further supports a directional transportation mechanism because single - headed myosin cannot bind to two filaments simultaneously . Collectively , these results strongly suggest the active involvement of myosin on the cytokinetic ring assembly . A spontaneous increase in myosin density triggers ring contraction Ultrastructural studies on cytokinetic rings have revealed that the rings lack a sarcomere - like periodic structure 39 , 40 , suggesting that the contraction mechanism is diﬀerent from that of striated muscle . The total volume of actin filaments decreased as contraction proceeded in sea urchin embryos 41 , and the individual actin filaments in the rings shortened during contraction in fission yeast 42 . On the basis of these findings , a force generation mechanism involving actin depolymerization has been proposed 43 . However , a recent study on cytokinetic rings isolated from fission yeast demonstrated that actin depolymerization is not necessary 44 . Therefore , the contraction mechanism is not yet defined 45 . To elucidate the contraction mechanism , it is important to identify the minimal components and conditions essential for actin ring NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 17 | NUMBER 4 | APRIL 2015 485 © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

Methylcellulose was not added . The ratios of the diameter of the ring at a certain time R ring ( t ) to that at the time of formation R ring ( t 0 ) were plotted . Actin polymerization was initiated at 0min . After the contraction , the cross - sectional ﬂuorescence intensity of the rings had a single peak . Thus , the rings were completely contracted ( R ring ( t ) = 0 ) . The complete contraction occurred before the depletion of ATP . We performed more than ten independent experiments and conﬁrmed the repeatability . Note that it was difﬁcult to determine whether the ring disassembly phase existed because actin polymerization did not reach a steady phase before complete contraction . Scale bar , 2 µ m . contraction . Here , we found that the self - assembled actin rings contracted in the presence of HMM and ATP without any actomyosin regulatory proteins and accessory proteins ( Fig . 3a , b ) . With increasing HMM concentrations , both the contraction probability and the contraction magnitude increased ( Fig . 3a , g and Supplementary Fig . 3a ) . Time - lapse microscopy showed that the rings were always assembled near the equator irrespective of HMM concentration ( Fig . 4a , b ) . Subsequently , the rings began to contract . Between 0 . 2 µ M and 5 µ M HMM , this contraction was slow , and stopped at a weakly contracted state ( Fig . 4a , c and Supplementary Video 8 ) . At 25 µ M HMM , 22 % of the actin rings exhibited strong contraction ( Fig . 4b , c and Supplementary Video 9 ) . This process was characterized by a slow contraction phase followed by a fast contraction phase and the ring disassembly phase ( Fig . 4b – e and Supplementary Fig . 3b ) . Once the ring had assembled , some rings exhibited thinning of the bundles ( Fig . 4e blue open squares , Supplementary Fig . 3c ) . This process was terminated within 15min . Subsequently , the ring continued to contract slowly , followed by fast contraction . During contraction , the 486 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 17 | NUMBER 4 | APRIL 2015 © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved A RT I C L E S ring slid along the lipid surface , which resembles the cytokinetic rings in the spheroplasts of fission yeast 46 . The timing of fast contraction was proportional to the initial concentration of the source for the ATP - regenerating system ( Supplementary Fig . 4b , d ) . Depletion of ATP raises the ADP concentration , which prolongs the dwell time of the tight - binding states of myosin . As a result of the synergistic eﬀects of decreasing the ATP concentration and increasing the ADP concentration , the number of bound myosin molecules gradually increased . Once the ring established connections over the entire circumference , the local contractile force would propagate across the entire system , and thus the ring could enter the fast contraction phase 47 . We confirmed that 5 µ M HMM was insuﬃcient for strong contraction with depleted ATP levels ( Supplementary Fig . 4a , c and Supplementary Video 10 ) . In contrast , 50 µ M HMM induced disassembly of actin rings immediately after the commencement of the fast contraction phase ( Supplementary Video 11 ) . These results suggest that the molar ratio of actin and myosin is important for the contraction to complete . Ring contraction dynamics In the fast contraction phase , the contraction velocity was nearly proportional to the initial ring diameter ( Fig . 4f red filled circles ) , which recapitulates the common feature of cytokinetic rings in nematode embryos 48 and other organisms 3 . Linear fitting of the experimental data ( Fig . 4f red solid line ) implied the existence of a critical circumference length of the initial ring perimeter ( P ∗ = 4 . 5 µ m ) , below which the ring cannot contract . We found that the mean length of the actin filaments extracted from the droplets was consistent with P ∗ ( Fig . 4f grey bars and Supplementary Fig . 3d , e ) . These results suggest that the self - assembled actomyosin ring has an eﬀective contraction unit , even though the ring might lack periodic sarcomere - like structures similar to the cytokinetic rings , and the length of the eﬀective contraction unit might be determined on the basis of the mean length of actin filaments . During both the slow and fast contraction processes , the total volume of the ring - shaped bundle was maintained at a nearly constant level ; that is , the total amount of actin filaments was conserved until the beginning of disassembly phase ( Fig . 4e blue filled circles ) . Moreover , actin rings contracted in the presence of excess phalloidin ( Supplementary Video 12 ) and the contraction rate remained unchanged with phalloidin treatment ( Fig . 4f red open triangles and Supplementary Fig . 3f ) . These results suggest that the rings could contract without actin disassembly and depolymerization . This finding is consistent with the behaviour of cytokinetic rings isolated from fission yeast 44 . Immediately after fast contraction , the fluorescence intensity of the actin bundle began to decrease ( Fig . 4d ) . The bundle then began to spread ( Fig . 4eblueopentrianglesandSupplementaryFig . 3c ) , andthe clear ring structure disappeared . This phenomenon might be similar to that observed in other in vitro actomyosin networks 36 , 49 . Comparison between myosin II - HMM and myosin V Replacement of myosin II - HMM with the other double - headed motor protein myosin V also promoted ring formation and induced con - traction in a dose - dependent manner ( Fig . 5a – d and Supplementary Fig . 5 and Supplementary Table 1 ) . However , the concentration of myosin V at which ring formation was promoted was approximately two orders of magnitude lower than that of myosin II - HMM ( Fig . 5b ) . This diﬀerence could be explained by the diﬀerence in the duty ratios of myosin ( Fig . 5e ) . To translocate two adjacent actin filaments , as discussed above , both of the motor heads should bind to the fila - ments simultaneously . The eﬀective concentration of such motors can be approximated by [ myosin ] eﬀ = [ myosin ] bulk × ( duty ratio ) 2 , where [ myosin ] bulk is the concentration of myosin in droplets . Here , the duty ratios of the single motor head of myosin II and myosin V are 0 . 04 – 0 . 05 ( refs 50 , 51 ) and 0 . 5 – 0 . 7 ( refs 52 , 53 ) , respectively , which are equal to the two - order magnitude diﬀerence in [ myosin ] eﬀ . The ring contraction probability of myosin V also showed good correla - tion with that of myosin II - HMM if the eﬀective concentration was used ( Fig . 5c ) . Unlike myosin II , myosin V did not induce strong contraction , even though [ myosin ] eﬀ was nearly equal to that of myosin II - HMM ( Fig . 5d ) . This might also be attributable to the diﬀerence in the duty ratios . With myosin II - HMM , the depletion of ATP further raised [ myosin ] eﬀ markedly , indicating that [ myosin ] eﬀ could be increased to more than 100 times the initial [ myosin ] eﬀ , as expected from the low duty ratio ( 0 . 05 ) of myosin II ( 1 2 / 0 . 05 2 ∼ 400 ) . In contrast , the [ myosin ] eﬀ ofmyosinVcouldbeincreasedtoonlyfourtimestheinitial [ myosin ] eﬀ because of the higher duty ratio ( 1 2 / 0 . 5 2 ∼ 4 ) , which could explain why strong contraction rarely occurred with myosin V . Effects of crosslinkers and myosin oligomerization A comparison between two types of double - headed motor allowed us to illustrate their shared features and quantify the eﬀects using a unified parameter , ‘eﬀective concentration’ . Our results suggested an optimal eﬀective concentration of myosin for promoting ring formation , above which further increases in the eﬀective concentration induced ring contraction ( Fig . 5f and Supplementary Video 13 ) . Although the detailed structure of myosin in cytokinetic rings is unresolved , myosin might form oligomers 3 , 16 , 39 , 40 . An increase in the number of motor heads in the oligomers could markedly raise the eﬀective concentration of myosin , which should be examined with our model system . It is also important to investigate whether crosslinking proteins promote actin ring formation by the same confinement - induced assembly mechanism as methylcellulose because cytokinetic rings are assembled with passive crosslinkers 1 – 4 , 8 – 14 . We first examined the eﬀects of α - actinin , one of the crosslinking proteins existing on cytokinetic rings 8 – 11 , in the presence of methylcellulose . The ring formation probability and a critical droplet diameter R droplet ∗ monotonically decreased with increasing α - actinin concentration ( Fig . 6a and Supplementary Fig . 6a and Supplementary Table 1 ) , which was consistent with the eﬀects of HMM inactive states ( Fig . 3a and Supplementary Fig . 2g ) . Next , we kept the α - actinin concentration constant and varied the HMM concentration . The ring formation probability recovered as the HMM concentration increased ( Fig . 6b and Supplementary Fig . 6b and Supplementary Table 1 ) . These results suggested that the balance between the passive crosslinking and dynamic remodelling of actin filaments was important for successful ring assembly . Indeed , even in the absence of methylcellulose , actin rings self - assembled when enough HMM coexisted with α - actinin ( Fig . 6c , d and Supplementary Table 1 ) .

All rights reserved A RT I C L E S R droplet ∗ was 10 µ m and the rings always assembled near the equator ( Supplementary Fig . 6c , d ) , which supports the confinement - induced mechanism we proposed ( Fig . 2e ) . The actin rings bundled with α - actinin contracted at 25 µ M HMM by depleting ATP , but the contraction was incomplete ( Fig . 6c and Supplementary Video 14 ) . Here , we replaced 2 µ M out of 25 µ M HMM with full - length myosin II forming submicrometre - long filaments ( Supplementary Fig . 6e ) , and repeated the experiments . Although the ring formation probability decreased ( Fig . 6c ) , 44 % of rings exhibited complete contraction ( Fig . 6e and Supplementary Video 15 ) immediately after ring formation and before depletion of ATP ( within 10min , n = 35 droplets ) . Only full - length myosin II without HMM prevented ring formation completely ( Supplementary Table 1 ) ; that is , myosin filament organization was inappropriate for ring assembly . DISCUSSION We have demonstrated that actin filaments could assemble into a single ring - shaped bundle inside a cell - sized confined space without any spatial regulatory signals . On the basis of droplet size and geometry dependencies , we propose a confinement - induced assembly mechanism , which indicates a direct contribution of cell rounding to contractile ring assembly . When mitotic cells are non - spherical , spindles tend to orient their long axis to the long axis of the cell 54 , 55 . Thus , cytokinetic rings will be assembled at the plane perpendicular to the long axis of the cell in accordance with the regulatory signals emitted from the spindles . In contrast , in compressed droplets , actin rings self - assembled at the plane not perpendicular , but parallel to the long axis . This result suggests that the cytokinetic rings in non - spherical mitotic cells might be unstable if the connection with the spindles is not strong enough . Therefore , our in vitro model will enhance the understanding of the role of mitotic cell rounding : the spherical shape facilitates both cytokineticringassemblyandthestablepositioningowingtothepoint symmetry of the cell boundary . The present bottom - up approach has clarified that myosin can regulate both actin ring assembly and contraction , depending on its concentration and state ( dimer or oligomer ) . Our results strongly suggest that myosin dimers ( and probably small oligomers ) could promote the cytokinetic ring assembly , and the maturation of myosin oligomers after successful ring assembly could switch the ring assembly phase to the contraction phase and induce the complete contraction . Collectively , we have successfully quantified the eﬀects of cellular microenvironment , actin polymerization , myosin concentration and its oligomerization on the self - organization of contractile actomyosin rings . These results suggest that cell rounding and actin polymerization followed by the stepwise increase in myosin density on actin filaments and myosin oligomerization are important for the regulation of cytokinetic ring dynamics from self - assembly to contraction .

Monomeric actin was stored in G buﬀer ( 2mM Tris - HCl pH8 . 0 , 0 . 05mM CaCl 2 , 2mM NaN 3 , 0 . 1mM ATP , 0 . 5mM 2 - mercaptoethanol ) . Protein preparation . Actin and myosin were purified from rabbit white skeletal muscle . Heavy meromyosin ( HMM ) and Subfragment - 1 ( S - 1 ) were prepared from rabbit white skeletal muscle myosin , digested by α - chymotrypsin . S - 1 was further purified by gel chromatography ( Superdex 200 Increase 10 / 300 , GE Healthcare ) . We prepared recombinant myosin V , whose tail region was deleted to minimize the interaction with phospholipids at the boundary of water - in - oil droplets . The method was according to our previous report 56 with slight modifications . First , the cDNA for mouse myosin V was truncated at the Arg - 1091 codon . After adding the c - myc epitope at the carboxy - terminal end , the myosin V - HMM was cloned into pFastBac HT vectors for expression in the Bac - to - Bac baculovirus expression system ( Life Technologies ) . The human calmodulin ( CaM ) construct was cloned into the pFastBac1 vector . Next , Sf9 insect cells were co - infected with the viruses encoding myosin V - HMM and CaM . Three days later , the cells were collected by centrifugation and lysed by resuspension in a hypotonic lysis buﬀer ( 20mM Tris - HCl pH8 . 0 , 2mM MgCl 2 , 2mM EGTA , 1mM ATP , 7mM 2 - mercaptoethanol ) containing 3 µ M CaM and protease inhibitors ( 10 µ gml − 1 leupeptin , 10 µ gml − 1 pepstatin A , 10 µ gml − 1 chymostatin , 1mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride ) . After adding NaCl to a final concentration of 300mM , the cell lysate was centrifuged at 100 , 000 g for 15min at 4 ◦ C . To hydrolyse residual ATP , 10 % ( w / v ) glucose and 200 units of hexokinase were added to the supernatant ( ∼ 25ml ) and stirred for 30min at 4 ◦ C . Next , 2mg of F - actin and 40 µ g phalloidin were added and gently stirred for 60min at 4 ◦ C , followed by centrifugation at 250 , 000 g for 15min . The pellet was resuspended in Ni - NTA aﬃnity buﬀer ( 20mM Tris - HCl pH8 . 0 , 300mM NaCl , 2mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 5mM EGTA , 7mM 2 - mercaptoethanol ) containing 10mM imidazole and 7mM ATP , and centrifuged at 400 , 000 g for 20min . Ni - NTA agarose ( Qiagen ) was added to the supernatant and stirred for 90min at 4 ◦ C . Next , the mixture , to which 3mM ATP was added , was applied to an open column . After washing with Ni - NTA aﬃnity buﬀer containing 20mM imidazole , myosin V - HMM was eluted with Ni - NTA aﬃnity buﬀer containing 200mM imidazole , and then dialysed overnight against 10mM imidazole pH7 . 2 , 75mM KCl , 2 . 5mM MgCl 2 , 1mM EGTA and 5mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) . The dialysed myosin V was centrifuged at 10 , 000 g for 10min and , after the addition of 35 % ( w / v ) sucrose as a cryoprotectant , snap frozen in liquid nitrogen , and stored at − 84 ◦ C . Recombinant human calmodulin ( CaM ) was prepared as follows . First , human CaM cDNA was cloned into the pRSET vector ( Life Technologies ) . This plasmid vector was transformed into Rosetta ( DE3 ) competent cells ( Millipore ) , and then CaM was expressed and purified according to the method of ref . 57 . Recombinant human α - actinin I was prepared as follows . First , × 6 histidine - tag including the PreScission protease recognition site was added at the C - terminal end of human α - actinin I cDNA . This construct was cloned into pFastBac HT vectors for expression in the Bac - to - Bac baculovirus expression system ( Life Technologies ) . Next , Sf9insectcellswereinfectedwiththevirusesencoding α - actininI . Threedays later , the cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in PBS containing 0 . 1mM EGTA , 0 . 1mM EDTA , 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , 7mM 2 - mercaptoethanol and protease inhibitors ( 10 µ gml − 1 leupeptin , 10 µ gml − 1 pepstatin A , 10 µ gml − 1 chymostatin , 1mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride ) . After adding KCl to a final concentration of 300mM , the cell suspension was lysed by sonication , then centrifuged at 141 , 900 g for 20min at 4 ◦ C and the supernatant was collected . After adding imidazole – HCl to a final concentration of 30mM , Ni Sepharose 6 Fast Flow ( GE Healthcare ) was added and gently stirred for 90min at 4 ◦ C . The Ni - NTA beads were washed with PBS containing 30mM imidazole – HCl , 300mM KCl , 0 . 1mM EGTA , 0 . 1 % TritonX - 100and7mM2 - mercaptoethanolbycentrifugeseveraltimes , and then applied to an open column . His - tagged α - actinin I was eluted with PBS containing 200mM imidazole – HCl , 300mM KCl , 0 . 1mM EGTA and 7mM 2 - mercaptoethanol , and dialysed overnight against 50mM Tris - HCl pH7 . 0 , 150mM NaCl , 1mM EDTA and 1mM DTT at 2 ◦ C . The dialysed sample was centrifuged at 436 , 000 g for30minat2 ◦ Ctoremoveaggregates , andthenPreScissionprotease ( GE Healthcare ) wasaddedandincubatedfor > 16hat4 ◦ Ctodigestthehistidine - tag . To remove PreScission protease , Glutathione Sepharose 4B ( GE Healthcare ) was added to the sample and gently stirred for 90min at 4 ◦ C . This sample was applied to an open column and the flow - through was collected . Finally , to remove undigested α - actinin I , imidazole – HCl ( f . 30mM ) and Ni Sepharose 6 Fast Flow ( GE Healthcare ) were added to the flow - through and gently stirred for 90min at 4 ◦ C , and then the beadswereremovedbyusinganopencolumn . Thepurified α - actininIwasdialysed overnight against A150 buﬀer ( 50mM HEPES - KOH pH7 . 6 , 150mM KCl , 5mM MgCl 2 , 1mM EGTA ) containing 1mM 2 - mercaptoethanol at 2 ◦ C , centrifuged at 436 , 000 g for30minat2 ◦ Ctoremoveaggregates , thensnapfrozeninliquidnitrogen and stored at − 84 ◦ C . The purity of proteins was checked by SDS – PAGE ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) , and the activities were checked by in vitro motility assay , ATPase assay and pyrene assay . Protein concentrations were determined from ultraviolet absorbance , using absorption coeﬃcients A 1 % 280nm = 5 . 3cm − 1 for full - length myosin II , 6 . 0cm − 1 for HMM , 8 . 1cm − 1 for S - 1 , 3 . 0cm − 1 for myosin V - HMM , 9 . 61cm − 1 for α - actinin I and A 1 % 290nm = 6 . 3cm − 1 for G - actin , and using molecular weights of 470 , 000 for full - length myosin II , 350 , 000 for HMM , 110 , 000 for S - l , 467 , 000 for myosin V - HMM , 100 , 000 for α - actinin I and 42 , 000 for actin . CaM concentration was determined by the biuret assay . Pyrene - labelled actin was prepared with pyrenyl iodoacetamide . Alexa Fluor 488 - labelled HMM and Alexa Fluor 647 - labelled HMM were prepared with Alexa Fluor 488 carboxylic acid succinimidyl ester ( A - 20000 , Invitrogen ) or Alexa Fluor 647 succinimidyl ester ( A - 20006 , Invitrogen ) , respectively . Tetramethylrhodamine ( TMR ) - labelled actin was prepared with TMR - 5 - maleimide ( 204 - 16131 , Wako ) . Before use , HMM and S - 1 were dialysed against A50 buﬀer containing 1mM 2 - mercaptoethanol overnight to replace the stock buﬀer with the assay buﬀer , concentrated by centrifugal filters ( Amicon Ultra 100K , Millipore ) as needed , and usedwithinaday . MyosinV - HMMandCaMwereusedwithoutdialysisbecausethe stock concentrations were high and thus contamination of the stock buﬀers into the final solution was negligible . Preparationofmyosinfilaments . Wepreparedmyosinfilamentsaccordingtothe method of ref . 58 with several modifications . First , rabbit white skeletal myosin II stored in high - salt buﬀer containing 50 % glycerol was dialysed against A550 buﬀer ( 50mM HEPES - KOH pH7 . 6 , 550mM KCl , 5mM MgCl 2 , 1mM EGTA ) containing 1mM2 - mercaptoethanolovernight , andconcentratedbycentrifugalfilters ( Amicon Ultra 100K , Millipore ) up to 55 µ M . This sample was rapidly diluted by 1 . 75 times volume of A0 buﬀer ( 50mM HEPES - KOH pH7 . 6 , 0mM KCl , 5mM MgCl 2 , 1mM EGTA ) toreducetheKClconcentrationfrom550mMto200mMtoinitiatefilament formation , and incubated for 45min on ice . Then , the sample was diluted by A0 buﬀer to a final KCl concentration of 50mM . The final concentration of myosin filaments was 5 µ M . To estimate the filament length , myosin filaments were labelled with Alexa Fluor 488 carboxylic acid succinimidyl ester ( A - 20000 , Invitrogen ) and observed using fluorescence microscopy . Preparation of lipid – oil mixture . We prepared the lipid – oil mixture according to our previous report 59 . We used 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphoethanolamine ( DOPE ; 850725P , Avanti Polar Lipids ) to stabilize cell - sized water - in - oil droplets . The lipid concentration in oil was 1mM . The lipid – oil mixture was stored at room temperature under dark conditions and used within a week . Microscopy . Epifluorescence and bright - field images of the droplets were observed byacustom - builtinvertedmicroscopeequippedwitha × 100objective ( PlanApoNA 1 . 40 oil , Olympus ) , an electron - multiplying CCD ( charge - coupled device ) camera ( iXon3 DU - 897E - CS0 - # BV , Andor Technology ) . The motorized stage , shutters and the camera were controlled by a custom - built LabVIEW program ( National Instruments ) . The custom - built heat block , which connected to the water bath ( NESLAB RTE - 7 , Thermo Scientific or AB - 1600 , ATTO ) , was mounted on the objective lens to maintain the sample temperature at 25 ± 1 ◦ C . Confocal fluorescence images of the droplets were observed by an inverted microscope ( IX71 , Olympus ) equipped with a × 60 objective ( UPlanSApo NA 1 . 35 oil , Olympus ) for the droplet assay or a × 40 objective ( UPlanFLN NA 0 . 75 oil , Olympus ) for the bulk assay , a confocal scanner unit ( CSU10 , Yokogawa ) , an electron - multiplying CCD camera ( iXon + DU - 888E - C00 - # BV or iXon3 DU - 897E - CS0 - # BV , Andor Technology ) , and excitation lasers ( 488nm and 568nm ; 643 - YB - A01 , MellesGriot ) . Themotorizedstage , shuttersandthecamerawerecontrolledby a custom - built LabVIEW program ( National Instruments ) . All observations were performed at 25 ± 1 ◦ C . We confirmed that the images acquired by the epifluorescence microscope and the spinning - disc confocal microscope had no significant diﬀerences for the image analysis except for measuring the bundle width . For the bundle width analysis , we used the confocal microscope . In vitro self - assembly of actin networks inside the droplets . Before the experiments , we prepared × 8 E - mix ( 4mM ATP , 320mM phosphocreatine , 0 . 8mgml − 1 creatine phosphokinase , 80mM DTT ) in A50 buﬀer for the ATP - regenerating system , and incubated on ice for more than 15min to convert contaminated ADP into ATP . Next , 2 . 5 µ l of × 8 E - mix was mixed with 5 µ l ( or 0 µ l ) of 1 . 5 % ( w / v ) methylcellulose ( 1 , 500 cP ; 135 - 02142 , Wako ) in A50 buﬀer , 2 µ l of 20mM Trolox in A50 buﬀer to prevent photobleaching , 2 µ l of 5 µ M Alexa Fluor 546 - conjugated phalloidin ( A22283 , Invitrogen ) in × 2 A50 buﬀer , and 6 . 5 µ l ( or 11 . 5 µ l for no methylcellulose experiments ) of the desired concentration of HMM NATURE CELL BIOLOGY © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncb3142 M E T H O D S orS - 1 , and α - actininI . Thismixture ( 18 µ l ) wasaddedto2 µ lof100 µ Mmonomeric actin in G buﬀer and pipetted 5 times to mix instantly . The actin polymerization was initiated by mixing , of which the timing was defined as t = 0s . Subsequently , 2 µ l of the mixture was put into 80 µ l of the lipid – oil mixture in a 1 . 5ml sample tube ( Eppendorf ) , andjustafter15sfromtheinitiationofactinpolymerization , this sample was vortexed for 30s ( power max ; Vortex - Genie 2 , Scientific Industries ) to form cell - sized droplets . The lipid – oil mixture had been equilibrated at 24 ± 1 ◦ C , and the droplet formation was carried out at the same temperature . In total , it took 45s to complete droplet formation from the initiation of actin polymerization . We did not use the droplets that took more or less than 45s to complete the procedure . The droplets contained final concentrations of 0 . 375 % ( or 0 % ) methylcellulose , 0 . 5mM ATP , 40mM phosphocreatine , 0 . 1mgml − 1 creatine phosphokinase , 2mM Trolox , 10mMDTT , 10 µ Mactin , 0 . 5 µ MAlexaFluor546 – phalloidin ( 5 % ( mol / mol ) of actin ) , and the desired amount of HMM or S - 1 , and α - actinin I . We confirmed thatadditionof5 % AlexaFluor546 – phalloidindidnotaltertheactinpolymerization dynamics 60 ( Supplementary Fig . 2e ) . An observation chamber was assembled by placing two double - sided tapes ( thickness ∼ 100 µ m ) ontoasilicone - coatedcoverslip ( 24 × 36mm 2 , thicknessNo . 1 ; Matsunami ) with another coverslip ( 18 × 18mm 2 or 9 × 18mm 2 , thickness No . 1 ; Matsunami ) on top . Immediately after the droplet formation , the droplet solution was perfused into the chamber and the chamber was sealed with Valap to prevent flow . We confirmed that the droplets retained a spherical shape more than four hours . The droplets larger than 1 µ m in diameter were analysed . To compress the droplets , 2 µ l of droplet solution was placed on the silicone - coated coverslip ( 24 × 36mm 2 , thickness No . 1 ; Matsunami ) and compressed by another silicone - coated coverslip ( 20 × 20mm 2 , thickness No . 2 ; Matsunami ) from thetop . ThechamberwassealedwithValaptopreventflow . Theheightbetweentwo coverslips was 4 . 44 ± 0 . 45 µ m ( mean ± s . d . ) . For the experiments of 2 µ M or 5 µ M actin , to maintain the actin and phalloidin molar ratio constant , 2 µ l of 5 µ M Alexa Fluor 546 – phalloidin in × 2 A50 buﬀer in the above protocol was replaced with 2 µ l of 1 µ M or 2 . 5 µ M Alexa Fluor 546 – phalloidin in × 2 A50 buﬀer , and 2 µ l of 100 µ M monomeric actin in G buﬀer was replaced with 2 µ l of 20 µ M or 50 µ M monomeric actin in G buﬀer , respectively . For the experiments of myosin V , CaM was also added at a final concentration of 0 . 2mgml − 1 ( ref . 56 ) . For the experiments of ADP state or rigor state of HMM , × 8 E - mix in the above protocol was replaced with 4mM ADP and 80mM DTT in A50 buﬀer , or 80mM DTT in A50 buﬀer , respectively . In addition , 100 µ M of monomeric actin was pre - incubated with 1 unit ml − 1 of hexokinase and 1mM glucose ( ADP state ) , or with 1 unit ml − 1 of apyrase ( rigor state ) for 5min at room temperature and immediately used . The eﬀects of the initial concentration of the source of the ATP - regenerating system were examined by changing the concentration of phosphocreatine . The concentrations of ATP and creatine phosphokinase were fixed . For the experiments of 0 . 1mM phalloidin treatment , 5 % or 10 % TMR - labelled actin was used instead of adding 5 % ( mol / mol ) of Alexa Fluor 546 - labelled phalloidin to observe actin filaments . For the experiments of full - length myosin II , we used × 20 E - mix ( 10mM ATP , 200mMphosphocreatine , 2 . 0mgml − 1 creatinephosphokinase , 200mMDTT ) dissolved in A50 buﬀer instead of × 8 E - mix to minimize the volume of E - mix . The final concentration of phosphocreatine was lowered from 40mM to 10mM , but we confirmed that the ring contraction induced by full - length myosin II was almostindependentoftheinitialphosphocreatineconcentration , indicatingthatthe contraction started before depletion of ATP . In vitro self - assembly of actin networks without confinement . For the bulk assay , an observation chamber was assembled by placing two double - sided tapes ( thickness ∼ 100 µ m ) onto a normal coverslip ( 24 × 36mm 2 ; Matsunami ) with anothercoverslip ( 18 × 18mm 2 ; Matsunami ) ontop . Immediatelyaftertheinitiation of actin polymerization by mixing actin monomer solution with the polymerizing solution , the mixture was perfused into the chamber and sealed with Valap to prevent flow . Pyrene assay . Actin polymerization was monitored by the fluorescence intensity of pyrene - labelled actin with the fluorescence spectrophotometer ( F - 4500 , Hitachi ) , equipped with a water bath ( AB - 1600 , ATTO ) to maintain the temperature at 25 ± 0 . 5 ◦ C . First , 300 µ l of 20 µ M or 4 µ M monomeric actin ( 2 % pyrene labelled ) and 20mM DTT in G buﬀer was put inside the spectrophotometer cell and incubated for 5min inside the spectrophotometer to stabilize the temperature at 25 ◦ C . Simultaneously , a 300 µ l mixture of 1 µ M ( for 20 µ M actin ) , 0 . 5 µ M ( for 10 µ M actin ) , or 0 . 2 µ M ( for 4 µ M actin ) Alexa Fluor 546 – phalloidin , 4mM Trolox and 1mM ATP dissolved in × 2 A50 buﬀer was pre - incubated at 25 ◦ C for 5min . This mixture was added to monomeric actin to initiate actin polymerization , pipetted 5 times to mix instantly , and the fluorescenceincrease ( excitationwavelength : 365nm , emissionwavelength : 407nm ) was measured . For the experiments of ADP state buﬀer or rigor state buﬀer , the final concentrations of 1 unit ml − 1 of hexokinase and 1mM glucose ( ADP state ) , or 1 unit ml − 1 of apyrase ( rigor state ) were added to the 300 µ l of monomeric actin solution and the same procedure as described above was performed . Analysis of the ring formation probability . Immediately after the droplet formation , the sample chamber was placed on the epifluorescence microscope , or custom - built heat block connected to a water bath ( AB - 1600 , ATTO ) , to maintain the sample temperature at 25 ± 1 ◦ C . After 2 . 5h from the initiation of actin polymerization , droplets were scanned in the Z axis and both the fluorescence and bright - field cross - sectional images were acquired in every Z - position . In each experiment , 58 – 161 droplets were scanned . We counted the number of the droplets that contained a single uniform ring - shaped actin bundle , and this number was divided by the total number of the droplets to obtain the ring formation probability . To obtain the precise ring formation probability in each independent experiment , we increased the number of droplets step by step , and chose the sample number at which the probability was converged to nearly a constant value in each experiment . Weperformedthreeindependentexperiments , andthemeanandthes . d . valueswere obtained , unless otherwise stated . In the case of full - length myosin II experiments , the samples were observed by time - lapse microscopy with an interval of 2min , and the number of the droplets that showed assembly of a single uniform ring - shaped actin bundle was counted . The reason why the time - lapse observation was performed to identify the single actin rings is that both actin rings and branched actin bundle networks rapidlycontractedandformedsingleclusters , sothattheybecameindistinguishable within 30min . Analysis of the ring assembly time . Immediately after the droplet formation , the samplechamberwasplacedonanepifluorescencemicroscope , equippedwithaheat block to maintain the sample temperature at 25 ± 1 ◦ C , and the image acquisition was started . Every 5min , the droplet was scanned in the Z axis . We observed 43 – 67 droplets that showed spontaneous ring formation in total at each condition , and the cumulative probabilities of the ring formation were obtained . Analysisoftheringorientationangle . Theringorientationangle θ wasestimated from the distance between the bottommost point and the topmost point of the ring in the Z - axis h ring , and the diameter of the ring R ring , that is , θ = sin − 1 ( h ring / R ring ) . Analysisoftheringandthedropletdiameters . Wefirstpreparedthemaximum - projection fluorescence images of the droplets . In the maximum - projection image , the actin ring usually shaped an ellipse ( Fig . 1d ) . The peak - to - peak distance of the longaxisoftheellipsewasdefinedastheringdiameter R ring . Inthecaseoffull - length myosin II experiments , the shape of the ring was jagged during contraction in some cases ( Fig . 6e ) . For such cases , the ring was fitted with an ellipse and the length of its long axis was defined as R ring . The droplet diameter R droplet was measured from the bright - field cross - sectional image . Image analysis was performed using ImageJ and LabVIEW ( National Instruments ) . Measurement of the length of individual actin filaments . The water - in - oil droplets containing actomyosin were prepared as described above . This emulsion in the 1 . 5ml sample tube was incubated at 25 ± 1 ◦ C , floated on a water bath ( NESLAB RTE - 7 , Thermo Scientific ) , for 1h to polymerize actin . Next , 100 µ l of A50 buﬀer containing 0 . 5 µ M of Alexa Fluor 546 – phalloidin was placed inside a glass test tube , and 40 µ l of the emulsion including various sizes of droplets was gently placed on the buﬀer . This test tube was centrifuged at 20 , 000 g for 15min at 4 ◦ C to push the droplets into the bottom buﬀer . In our condition , probably because we used pure DOPE to stabilize water - in - oil droplets , most of the droplets did not assemble into liposomes at the oil / water interface 59 , but the inner solution of the droplets was mixed into the bottom buﬀer . When the polymerized actin filaments inside the droplets were exposed to the bottom buﬀer , the filaments were stabilized by the excess amounts of Alexa Fluor 546 – phalloidin within a minute , and the depolymerization was prohibited 61 . The depolymerized length of actin filaments before the actin filaments were completely stabilized by Alexa Fluor 546 – phalloidin was estimated to be 1 . 39 µ m at the maximum by considering the associationrateconstantofphalloidintoactin 61 , andthedissociationrateconstantof monomeric actinfrom actinfilaments 62 . Inthe caseof 0 . 1mMphalloidin - treatment experiments , 100 µ l of 0 . 5 µ M Alexa Fluor 546 – phalloidin placed inside a glass test tube was replaced with 100 µ l of 0 . 1mM phalloidin dissolved in A50 buﬀer . After centrifugation , the top mineral oil in the test tube was removed by aspiration and the F - actin solution was perfused into a flow chamber , at the bottom of which N - ethylmaleimide - modified HMM ( NEM - HMM ) had been immobilized . The flow chamber was assembled by placing two double - sided tapes ( thickness ∼ 100 µ m ) NATURE CELL BIOLOGY © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

AfterimmobilizingNEM - HMM , thesurfacewas coated with bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) to prohibit adsorption of free fluorescent dye . This BSA treatment was crucial to gain a suﬃcient signal - to - noise ratio of the fluorescence image of actin filaments . The contour length of immobilized actin filamentswasmeasuredwithusinganImageJplugin : JFilament2D . Fromthedroplet sizedistribution ( SupplementaryFig . 2a ) , weestimatedthat > 90 % ofactinfilaments extracted from the droplets were polymerized in droplets with a diameter between 1 and 20 µ m . Statisticalanalysis . Statisticalcomparisonsoftheringformationprobabilitieswere performed using the unpaired double - sided Student’s t - test , and the results are shown in each figure . We also performed a χ 2 - test and obtained the same results . The raw data sets and the actual P values of Student’s t - test and the χ 2 - test are summarized in Supplementary Table 1 . Repeatability . All experiments that were used for quantification were repeated three times . All remaining experiments , representative images of which are shown in figures , were repeated at least two times up to > 10 times . 56 . Ohki , T . , Mikhailenko , S .

( a ) Distributions of the droplet diameter R droplet . The mean diameter was 4 . 77 m m ( n = 3152 droplets ) . The diameter was measured from the bright - field image ( inset image ; scale bar , 5 m m ) . We performed > 20 independent experiments at various conditions , and confirmed that the size distribution was independent of the droplet inclusion . ( b , c ) Effects of methylcellulose . ( b ) Confocal maximum projection image of actin filaments polymerised inside the droplets in the absence of methylcellulose . Actin rings were not assembled ( n = 117 droplets ) . The image was taken 60 min after initiation of actin polymerisation . Dashed lines indicate the droplet peripheries . Actin filaments distributed homogeneously inside the droplets , i . e . , actin filaments had no specific interaction with the water / oil interface . Scale bar , 5 m m . ( c ) The ring formation probabilities at various concentrations of methylcellulose ( 1 , 500 cP ) . Polyethylene glycol ( PEG ; 20 kDa ) also promoted ring formation , showing that ring formation was not a methylcellulose - specific effect but the depletion effect of macromolecules . The inset image shows the typical example of actin rings assembled by PEG ( scale bar , 2 m m ) . The dashed line indicates the droplet periphery . More than 50 droplets were analysed in each condition . In the case of 0 . 375 % methylcellulose , three independent experiments were performed and the mean ring formation probability is shown . The error bar indicates the SD . In all conditions , 10 m M actin was used . Raw data are provided in Supplementary Table 1 . ( d ) Distribution of HMM inside the droplet . Cross - sectional confocal image at the equatorial plane of the droplet containing 25 m M of Alexa Fluor 488 - labeled HMM ( top ) and the fluorescence intensity profile of the cross section of the upper image ( bottom ) . HMM had no specific interaction with the water / oil interface . Scale bar , 5 m m . ( e ) Time courses of the fluorescence intensity of pyrene actin ( 2 % labeled ) . In all conditions , 10 m M actin was used . Actin polymerisation was initiated at 0 sec . To visualize actin filaments under microscope , we used 5 % ( mol / mol ) of Alexa Fluor 546 phalloidin . We confirmed that the addition of 5 % Alexa Fluor 546 phalloidin did not alter the actin polymerisation dynamics ( black and blue lines , which are overlapped ) . Five min pre - incubation of monomeric actin with 1 unit ml - 1 apyrase ( green line ) , or 1 mM ADP , 1 unit ml - 1 hexokinase , and 1 mM glucose ( yellow line ) had little effects on the actin polymerisation dynamics . ( f ) Five min pre - incubation of monomeric actin with 1 mM ADP , 1 unit ml - 1 hexokinase , and 1 mM glucose ( ADP solution ) , or 1 unit ml - 1 apyrase ( rigor solution ) did not change the ring formation probability . In all conditions , 10 m M actin and 0 m M HMM were used . The p - values are the results of double - sided Student’s t - test , showing no significant difference on the ring formation probability between three different buffer conditions . We performed three independent experiments , analysed 100−116 droplets in each experiment , and the mean probabilities were plotted . Error bars indicate the SDs of n = 3 independent experiments . Raw data are provided in Supplementary Table 1 . ( g ) Relationship between R droplet and ring formation probability at various conditions . 0 m M HMM ( control ) , n = 374 droplets ; 1 m M HMM ( ADP ) , n = 307 droplets ; 1 m M HMM ( rigor ) , n = 294 droplets ; 2 m M S - 1 , n = 291 droplets . We performed three independent experiments in each condition . For the representative images shown in ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) , we performed at least two independent experiments and confirmed the repeatability . © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

Cross - sectional fluorescence intensity profiles of the actin rings in the slow contraction phase ( top ) or in the disassembly phase ( bottom ) . The raw data ( blue lines ) were fitted by the sum of the two Gaussian functions ( yellow lines ) : F ( x ) = A 1 exp [ - 2 ( x - x 1 ) 2 / d 12 ] + A 2 exp [ - 2 ( x - x 2 ) 2 / d 22 ] + B , where x 1 and x 2 correspond to the peak position , d 1 and d 2 correspond to the width , and A 1 and A 2 correspond to the magnitude of the two peaks , respectively . B is the background noise . The values d 1 and d 2 were defined as the width of the actin bundle . We confirmed that this analysis yielded reasonable values of the bundle width in our conditions . ( d ) Relationship between the contraction rate and the droplet perimeter / diameter at the fast contraction phase . Blue solid line indicates the least - square linear fitting of the plots . The contraction rate was proportional to the droplet perimeter with 4 . 90 m m offset . This offset value was almost equal to P * in the main text ( Fig . 4f ) . The contraction rate per the unit perimeter length ( 1 m m ) was 0 . 31 m m min - 1 . ( e ) The fluorescence image of actin filaments extracted from the droplets .

Fast contractions stopped before the rings strongly contracted .
