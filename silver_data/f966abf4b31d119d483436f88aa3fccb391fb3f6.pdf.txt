Using quantitative single vesicle imaging and acute manipulation of phosphoinositides we show that APPL endosomes , which participate in growth factor receptor trafﬁcking and signaling , represent an early endocytic interme - diate common to a subset of clathrin derived endo - cytic vesicles and macropinosomes . Most APPL endosomes are precursors of classical PI3P positive endosomes , and PI3P plays a critical role in promoting this conversion . Depletion of PI3P causes a striking reversion of Rab5 positive endosomes to the APPL stage , and results in enhanced growth factor signaling . These ﬁndings reveal a surprising plasticity of the early endocytic pathway . Importantly , PI3P functions as a switch to dynamically regulate maturation and signaling of APPL endosomes . INTRODUCTION Endocytosis , the process whereby cells internalize portions of their plasma membrane along with ligands for their receptors and other extracellular material , plays a multiplicity of functions in eukaryotic cells . The fate of endocytic vesicles following inter - nalization is the focus of intense investigation in a plethora of biological ﬁelds that span from fundamental cell biology to neuroscience and immunology . Additionally , a rapidly expanding list of medical conditions is due to abnormal endocytosis or post - endocytic mis - sorting of internalized material ( Colaluca et al . , 2008 ; Haglund et al . , 2007 ; Lee and Gao , 2008 ; Lowe , 2005 ; Lu et al . , 2007 ) . Recently , long held concepts about the function and organiza - tion of the endocytic pathway have been challenged . One clas - sical view was that following ﬁssion from the plasma membrane , newly formed vesicles are transported to , and fuse with , early endosomes ( Gruenberg , 2001 ; Mellman et al . , 1986 ; Zerial and McBride , 2001 ) , well - deﬁned organelles that function as initial molecular sorting stations . Growing evidence indicates that early endosomes are a morphologically and functionally heteroge - neous population , whose complexity is enhanced by the pres - ence of biochemically distinct membrane subdomains within individual organelles ( Hayakawa et al . , 2006 ; Lakadamyali et al . , 2006 ; Miaczynskaetal . , 2004a ; Sonnichsenetal . , 2000 ) . Further - more , it has been shown that newly formed endocytic vesicles can convert directly into early endosomes ( Porat - Shliom et al . , 2008 ) , and early endosomes into late endosomes ( Rink et al . , 2005 ) , thus implicating direct vesicle conversion as an alternative to trafﬁcking between stable donor and acceptor compartments . Another classical view held that endocytosis of cell surface receptors is a mechanism to turn - off their activation and down - regulate their signaling . However , it is now clear that signaling from a variety of receptors can continue , and even be ampliﬁed , as they travel along the endocytic pathway ( Di Fiore and De Camilli , 2001 ; Miaczynska et al . , 2004b ; von Zastrow and Sorkin , 2007 ) . This implies that transit and residence time of receptors in different stations along this pathway may serve as a mechanism to control signaling both in time and space . Hence , a precise understanding of receptor signaling requires a parallel elucidation of their endocytic trafﬁcking . Two classes of molecules that have a fundamental function as molecular tags in endocytic trafﬁc are small GTPases and phos - phoinositides ( Behnia and Munro , 2005 ; De Matteis et al . , 2005 ; Di Paolo and De Camilli , 2006 ; Odorizzi et al . , 2000 ; Zerial and McBride , 2001 ) . In particular , the small GTPase Rab5 along with 3 - phosphorylated phosphoinositides are present on clas - sical early endosomes where they coordinate the assembly of effector complexes important for the function and further matura - tion of these organelles . Efﬁcient recruitment of some of these 1110 Cell 136 , 1110 – 1121 , March 20 , 2009 ª 2009 Elsevier Inc . effectors , suchasEarlyEndosomalAntigen1 ( EEA1 ) andRabeno - syn - 5 is based on their simultaneous binding to Rab5 and phos - phatidylinositol 3 - phosphate ( PI3P ) ( Zerial and McBride , 2001 ) . Another recently identiﬁed Rab5 effector complex , which deﬁnes a subpopulation of endosomes largely distinct from classical EEA1 positive endosomes , is characterized by the presence of the membrane adaptor proteins APPL1 and 2 ( Miac - zynska et al . , 2004a ) . APPL1 and 2 , which directly bind Rab5 , also bind the lipid bilayer via a BAR and a PH domain ( Li et al . , 2007 ; Zhu et al . , 2007 ) , and the cytosolic region of membrane receptors , including the Nerve Growth Factor Receptor ( TrkA ) , Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ( EGFR ) and adiponectin receptor , via a PTB domain ( Hu et al . , 2003 ; Jones et al . , 2006 ; Lin et al . , 2006 ; Mao et al . , 2006 ) . APPL endosomes function as platforms for the assembly of signaling complexes which regulate the MAPK and Akt pathways . Accordingly , lack of APPL1 profoundly impacts Akt and MAPK signaling , leading to increased apoptosis during development and defective neurito - genesis ( Lin et al . , 2006 ; Schenck et al . , 2008 ; Varsano et al . , 2006 ) . Additionally , the recent demonstration that APPL1 inter - acts and colocalizes with the inositol 5 - phosphatase OCRL , whose mutations are responsible for Lowe Syndrome ( Erdmann et al . , 2007 ) , implicates this complex in human disease . These ﬁndings raise the question of what is the relationship between APPL endosomes and the canonical early endosomes positive for EEA1 , PI3P and Rab5 . In this study , we have combined advanced live cell imaging and new probes to rapidly ( within seconds ) perturb phosphoinositides to investigate the relationship of APPL endosomes to other endocytic organelles . We show that APPL endosomes represent a transient and very early endocytic station common to both clathrin - dependent and clathrin - independent pathways . We also demonstrate that PI3P is the switch that controls the maturation and signaling properties of APPL endosomes . RESULTS Transient Association of APPL1 with Newly Formed Macropinosomes Pilot experiments revealed that APPL1 is not only present on small vesicles at the cell periphery ( Erdmann et al . , 2007 ; Miac - zynska et al . , 2004a ) but also on a subset of large macropino - somes . The large size of these organelles makes possible their unambiguous tracking from their site of origin at the cell surface to deeper locations in the cell . Thus , we ﬁrst focused on these organelles toward our goal of determining the dynamics of APPL1 association - dissociation along the endocytic pathway . Robust formation of micron - size macropinosomes can be induced by the expression of the constitutively active V12G mutant of H - Ras , a key effector of growth factor receptors ( Porat - Shliom et al . , 2008 ; Schlessinger , 2000 ) . Accordingly , cotransfection of COS7 cells with H - RasV12G and with a GFP - fusion of the PH domain of the protein kinase Akt , a binding module for PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 and PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 , resulted in the formation of numerous macropinosomes that originated from the closure of GFP - PH Akt positive peripheral membrane rufﬂes ( Figures 1A – 1D and Movie S1 ) . Shortly after rufﬂe closure and vesicle ﬁssion , GFP - PH Akt was shed from the newly formed macropinosome . Loss of GFP - PH Akt from macropinosomes was closely followed by recruitment of an mRFP fusion protein of the Rab5 effector APPL1 ( mRFP - APPL1 ) , consistent with the report that loss of GFP - PH Akt is immediately followed by the recruitment of Rab5 ( Figures 1A – 1D and Movie S1 ) ( Porat - Shliom et al . , 2008 ) . Similar results were obtained when GFP - PH Akt was replaced by GFP - PH Btk1 , a speciﬁc probe for PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ( Figure S1A available online ) . The association of APPL1 with macropinosomes was transient ( 4 . 7 ± 2 . 3 min ) and terminated as they moved further toward the cell interior ( see below ) . To address the fate of these organelles , GFP - APPL1 was coex - pressed together with mRFP - FYVE EEA1 , a marker of phosphatidy - linositol 3 - phosphate ( PI3P ) , the signature PI of early endosomes ( Di Paolo and De Camilli , 2006 ; Gruenberg , 2001 ; Zerial and McBride , 2001 ) . Loss of APPL1 as the organelles moved centripe - tally within the cell precisely coincided with the acquisition of mRFP - FYVE EEA1 ( Figure 1E andMovie S2 ) . Accordingly , loss of APPL1 also coincided with recruitment of full length EEA1 , the PI3P and Rab5 effector present on classical early endosomes ( Figures 1F – 1I ) ( Simonsen et al . , 1998 ) . Thus , in the Ras - induced macropinocytic pathway , APPL1 deﬁnes a compartment that immediately follows ﬁssion from the cell surface and that subse - quently directly matures into canonical PI3P positive endosomes . A Subpopulation of Clathrin - Coated Pits at the Cell Edge Directly Generates APPL Endosomes Observations on Ras - induced macropinosomes prompted us to investigate whether APPL1 also deﬁnes a very early transient station downstream of clathrin - mediated endocytosis en route to PI3P positive endosomes . Dual - color Total Internal Reﬂection Fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy was performed on COS7 cells coexpressing GFP - APPL1 and light chain of clathrin - mRFP ( LCa - mRFP ) . Inspection of these cells showed that while LCa - mRFP spots were uniformly distributed on the plasma membrane , GFP - APPL1 spots were selectively enriched at the cell edge ( Figure 2A and Movie S3 ) . Time - lapse TIRF microscopy demonstrated that at a subset of clathrin - coated pits , disappearance of LCa - mRFP was closely followed by the appearance of GFP - APPL1 ( 3 . 4 ± 0 . 8 s later , n = 160 spots from 3 cells ; see Figures 2B and 2C , Movie S4 , and Figure S2 ; Erdmann et al . , 2007 ) . When LCa - mRFP spots were randomly selected and scored for their conversion into GFP - APPL1spots , themajorityofclathrin - coatedpitsthatunder - went this conversion were located at the cell edge ( (cid:2) 75 % , n = 600 spots from 3 cells ; yellow circles , Figure 2D ) . In contrast , the great majority of clathrin - coated pits located elsewhere did not give rise to an APPL1 spot following their disappearance ( red circles , Figure 2D ) . The preferential generation of APPL1 endosomes from clathrin - coated pits located near the cell edge provides an explanation for the peripheral distribution of both endogenous APPL1 ( Figure S2A ; Miaczynska et al . , 2004a ) and transfected GFP - APPL1 ( Figure 2A right and Movie S3 ) . Several studies have shown preferential binding of EGF to the cell edge in vitro ( Jiang et al . , 2003 ; Lidke et al . , 2004 ; Sigismund et al . , 2005 ) . Thus , our observations are consistent with the proposed roleof APPL endosomes in the trafﬁc of EGF ( Miaczyn - skaetal . , 2004a ) andwiththereportedbindingofthePTBdomain of APPL to the EGFR ( Jones et al . , 2006 ) . Accordingly , 41 % of Cell 136 , 1110 – 1121 , March 20 , 2009 ª 2009 Elsevier Inc . 1111 ﬂuorescently labeled EGF ( EGF - 488 ) was found in APPL1 - posi - tive vesicles following 5 min of internalization , while this overlap decreased to 17 % by 15 min , reﬂecting progressive transfer of EGF - 488 to EEA1 - positive endosomes ( Figure 2E and data not shown ) . Moreover , tracking of single EGF - 488 loaded vesicles in living cells revealed that 68 % acquired APPL1 within 8 min of their formation ( n = 100 ) , as in the example shown in Figure 2F . Block of Endocytosis Leads to Depletion of APPL Endosomes A precursor - product relationship between clathrin - coated pits and APPL endosomes implies that the absence of productive endocytosis will lead to loss of the APPL compartment . To test this hypothesis , we blocked clathrin - coated pit scission via overexpression of dominant - negative dynamin ( dyna - min K44A ) ( Damke et al . , 1994 ) . Expression of dynamin K44A re - sulted in a near depletion of GFP - APPL1 spots ( Figures 2G Figure 1 . Mapping APPL1 in the Early Endocytic Pathway Epiﬂuorescence images .

An independent approach to acutely block endocytosis in living cells was used in order to rule out potential indirect effects of dynamin K44A . PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is required for the nucleation of endocytic clathrin coats and other endocytic factors ( Di Paolo and De Ca - milli , 2006 ) . We acutely depleted PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 using a heterodimeri - zation system which recruits an inositol 5 - phosphatase to the cell surface following addition of a chemical derivative of rapa - mycin ( rapalogue ) ( Figure 2I ; Varnai et al . , 2006 ; Zoncu et al . , 2007 ) . Using this technique we have previously shown that a massive block of endocytosis is obtained ( Zoncu et al . , 2007 ) . Following recruitment of the 5 - phosphatase , but not of a control fusion protein , a dramatic disappearance of GFP - APPL1 spots was observed ( 81 ± 4 % decrease ; n = 3 cells , Figures 2J and 2K , Movie S5 ) . The disappearance of APPL1 occurred with a delay relative to the disappearance of clathrin - coated pits under identical conditions ( Zoncu et al . , 2007 ) , consistent with a precursor - product relationship . Finally , we tested the impact of RNAi - mediated depletion of clathrin heavy chain ( CHC ) on the APPL1 compartment . An siRNA treatment that resulted in a drastic depletion of CHC caused a 60 % 1112 Cell 136 , 1110 – 1121 , March 20 , 2009 ª 2009 Elsevier Inc . Figure 2 .

The stronger effect produced by dynamin K44A and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 depletion is consistent with the more global inhibitory action of these two manipulations on endocytosis . Collectively , our results place APPL endosomes directly downstream of both macropinosomes and a subset of clathrin - coated pits involved in the binding and internalization of growth factors . Sequential Conversion of APPL Endosomes to WDFY2 - and EEA1 - Positive Endosomes Our observations of macropinosomes indicated that shedding of APPL1 and recruitment of PI3P ligands , such as full length EEA1 or its FYVE EEA1 domain , occur in a coordinated fashion . Thus , we investigated whether , as in the case of macropinosomes , small APPL endosomes , which are predominantly derived from clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( see above ) , also converted into PI3P positive compartments . Minimal colocalization of APPL1 with EEA1 was observed in static images ( Figure 3A ) as reported ( Miaczynska et al . , 2004a ) . However , timelapse microscopy indicated that a small percentage ( < 10 % ) of APPL endosomes converted into EEA1 endosomes ( Figures 3B and 3H ) . Recently , a novel PI3P - binding early endosomal protein , WDFY2 , was described ( Hayakawa et al . , 2006 ) and named after the WD40 and FYVE domains present in its structure . When GFP - WDFY2 was coexpressed with mRFP - APPL1 in COS7 Figure 3 .

Importantly , TIRF microscopy re - vealed a high rate of conversion of APPL1 spots to WDFY2 spots ( 47 % ; n = 113 spots from 3 cells ; Figures 3D – 3F and 3H ) . The APPL1 to WDFY2 conversion occurred in a coordinated fashion , with the loss of APPL1 correlating with the appearance of WDFY2 ( see examples in Figures 3D – 3F and Movie S6 ) . Our subsequent analysis revealed that small , EEA1 - negative WDFY2 - positive spots progressively fused into larger structures as they gradually acquired EEA1 ( Figure 3G ) . In some cases , WDFY2 also associated with Ras - induced macropinosomes following shedding of APPL1 and slightly ahead or together with EEA1 ( data not shown ) . Therefore , WDFY2 deﬁnes a tran - sient PI3P positive compartment that derives , at least in part , from APPL endosomes and ultimately converges into the EEA1 compartment . Inducible Depletion of PI3P Causes an Expansion of the APPL1 Compartment To test the importance of PI3P in triggering the transition of APPL into WDFY2 and EEA1 endosomes , we used the rapalogue - dependent heterodimerization system to acutely recruit the inositol 3 - phosphatase myotubularin 1 [ MTM1 , an enzyme that acts on PI3P and PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 ] , to all Rab5 - positive endosomes ( Fili et al . , 2006 ; Figure 4A ) . Rapalogue mediated heterodimerization of the two compo - nents of the system ( CFP - FKBP 3 2 - Rab5 and mRFP - FRB - MTM1 ) , caused recruitment of mRFP - FRB - MTM1 to early endosomes ( Figure 4B ; top ) and the rapid loss of GFP - FYVE EEA1 from the same endosomes ( Figure 4B ; bottom ) , indicating efﬁcient PI3P dephosphorylation as reported ( Fili et al . , 2006 ) . In contrast , recruitment of the catalytically inactive mRFP - FRB - MTM1 C375S had no effect on the GFP - FYVE EEA1 punctate staining ( data not shown ) . Rapalogue - mediated PI3P depletion had opposite results on the distribution of WDFY2 and EEA1 compared to the distribution of APPL1 . The majority of WDFY2 ( Figure S4A and Movie S7 ) and EEA1 ( Figure 4E ) spots disappeared within minutes , consistent with the PI3P - binding properties of their FYVE domains . In contrast , the GFP - APPL1 spots increased robustly in intensity ( (cid:2) 3 fold ; Figures 4C and 4D ) and in number ( (cid:2) 2 fold ; Figure 4E andMovieS8 ) . Moreover , someofthenewGFP - APPL1spotsap - pearedinthecentralregion ofthecells , wheretheywerenormally not found ( Movie S8 ) . Strikingly , simultaneous imaging of APPL1 and WDFY2 during rapalogue - induced PI3P depletion revealed that APPL1 was recruited to the same organelles from which WDFY2 was lost ( Figures 4F and 4G ) . In control experiments , rapalogue - mediated recruitment of the catalytically inactive mRFP - FRB - MTM1 C375S had no effect on WDFY2 or APPL1 punctate staining ( Figure S4B and data not shown ) . The major pathway for PI3P synthesis on endosomes is direct phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol by the type III PI 3 - kinase hVps34 ( Odorizzi et al . , 2000 ) . To complement results obtained by the inducible recruitment of MTM1 to endosomes , the effect of acute block of hVps34 by wortmannin , an inhibitor of PI 3 - kinases was tested . Wortmannin treatment led to complete redistribution of GFP - EEA1 and GFP - WDFY2 from a punctate pattern to a diffuse cytosolic pattern , as reported ( Hayakawa et al . , 2006 ; Patki et al . , 1997 ) ( Figure S5A and data not shown ) and a concomitant (cid:2) 3 fold increase in the intensity of APPL1 spots ( Figures 4H , 4I , and S5B ) and (cid:2) 2 . 5 - fold increase in their number ( Figure 4J ) . As in the case of the rapalogue - mediated PI3P depletion , the increased number of GFP - APPL1 vesicles following wortmannin was due , at least in part , to the conversion of EEA1 endosomes to APPL1 positive endosomes ( Figures 4L and S5C ) . Notably , loss of EEA1 in response to wort - mannin was not paralleled by the dissociation of Rab5 . Even away from the cell edge , at sites where only few APPL endo - somes are normally found ( see Figure 2D ) , a large percentage of Rab5 spots became APPL1 positive following PI3P depletion ( Figures 4M and 4N ; 28 % versus 91 % ) . A ‘‘back - conversion’’ from an EEA1 stage to an APPL1 stage , was also readily observed for Ras - induced macropinosomes ( Figure 4K ) that had formed before the addition of wortmannin . In conclusion , two independent lines of evidence indicate that PI3P production on endosomes functions as a switch leading to the recruitment of PI3P and Rab5 effectors , and this event correlates with shedding of APPL1 . We reasoned that proteins that bind both Rab5 and PI3P may compete with APPL1 , which only binds Rab5 , for binding to a limited number of Rab5 molecules on the endosomal surface . If this were the case , increasing cellular levels of Rab5 should enhance the pool of APPL1 and EEA1 residing on the same vesi - cles . Indeed , stable overexpression of Rab5 leading to Rab5 levels 4 - fold higher than in control cells , resulted in an increased colocalization of endogenous EEA1 with endogenous APPL1 . Approximately 56 % of EEA1 endosomes were also positive for APPL1 in Rab5 overexpressing cells versus 13 % in control cells ( Figure S6A – S6C ) . Conversely , even in the presence of overex - pressed Rab5 , the majority of APPL1 endosomes ( 70 % ) re - mained EEA1 - free , likely due to the lack of PI3P in peripheral APPL - positive vesicles . Furthermore , the large endosomes induced by transient expression of constitutively active Rab5 ( Rab5 Q79L ) were positive both for APPL1 ( as described ; Miac - zynska et al . , 2004a ) and for the PI3P reporter GFP - FYVE EEA1 ( Figure S6D ) . Therefore , the presence of PI3P does not appear , per se , to antagonize binding of APPL1 to the same vesicle . Rather , excess Rab5 on PI3P - positive vesicles may allow simultaneous binding of APPL1 and EEA1 , further supporting a competition model . Expansion of the APPL Compartment Enhances EGF Receptor Signaling Numerous reports suggest that activated growth factor recep - tors continue to signal in endosomal compartments following their internalization ( Miaczynska et al . , 2004b ; Slessareva et al . , 2006 ; Vieira et al . , 1996 ; von Zastrow and Sorkin , 2007 ) . In partic - ular , APPL1 has been linked to the signaling activity of EGFR and TrkA via the Akt and MAPK pathways , although with different relative strength in different systems ( Lin et al . , 2006 ; Mao et al . , 2006 ; Schenck et al . , 2008 ; Varsano et al . , 2006 ) . Thus , it was of interest to determine how the expansion and block in Cell 136 , 1110 – 1121 , March 20 , 2009 ª 2009 Elsevier Inc . 1115 Figure 4 .

Inducible PI3P depletion resulted in a striking accumulation of ﬂuorescently labeled EGF inexpanded APPL1 - positive endo - somes . In untransfected cells and in cells where the catalytically inactive MTM1 C375S was recruited , only a very small fraction of EGF - 555 still colocalized with APPL1 after 60 min of internaliza - tion ( 7 . 7 % and 6 . 8 % , respectively ; Figures 5A , left , and 5B ) . In contrast , cells depleted of PI3P had 71 ± 6 % of EGF - 555 still localized within the now enlarged APPL1 endosomes ( Figures 5A , right , and 5B , n = 10 cells ) . We then determined how prolonged residency of EGF in the enlarged APPL compartment affected EGFR signaling . In these experiments , EGF ( 1 . 5 ng / ml ) was added to HeLa cells following the rapalogue - mediated recruitment of wild - type or catalytically inactive MTM1 to Rab5 endosomes . Cells were then lysed , and phosphorylation of several EGFR effectors was determined by western blotting . An increase in the phosphorylation of Erk1 / 2 that was (cid:2) 2 - fold higher than in control cells was observed ( n = 3 experiments ; Figures 5C and S7 ) . Enhanced Erk1 / 2 phos - phorylation was detected as early as 5 min after addition of EGF and persisted for up to 1 hr ( the maximum length of this experi - ment ) . An obvious difference in the phosphorylation at Ser 473 of Akt was not detected ( n = 3 experiments ) , possibly reﬂecting the very early and transient nature of this activation ( Figure 5C ) . However , phosphorylation of the direct and indirect Akt substrates GSK3 b ( Ser 9 ) , S6K1 ( Thr 389 ) and TSC2 ( Thr 1462 ) was increased by 2 - fold , 3 . 4 - fold and 2 . 5 - fold , respectively ( Figures 5C and S7 ) . Finally , to determine whether the increased signaling following PI3P depletion is directly due to prolonged residence of EGFR within APPL1 endosomes , RNAi for APPL1 was performed ( Figure 5D ) . Consistent with previous reports ( Schenck et al . , 2008 ; Varsano et al . , 2006 ) , the overall phosphorylation of MAPK and GSK3 b was reduced in cells treated with APPL1 siRNA compared to control siRNA treated cells . Strikingly , cells subjected to APPL1 knockdown and subsequently depleted of PI3P via recruitment of MTM1 did not show enhanced phosphor - ylation of MAPK and GSK3 b when compared to cells knocked down for APPL1 and expressing the inactive MTM1 C375S construct ( Figure 5D ; compare lanes 5 - 6 with 8 - 9 ) . Therefore , presence of APPL1 is essential for the observed increase in EGFR signaling following PI3P depletion . These biochemical ﬁndings provide further evidence for the role of APPL endosomes in the trafﬁcking of growth factor receptors from their sites of internalization to PI3P positive endo - somes . More importantly , they reveal that the residence time of growth factor receptors in the APPL - positive compartment critically affects the strength of the signals they generate . DISCUSSION In this study we provide new insight into the structural organiza - tion and dynamic architecture of the early endocytic pathway . Speciﬁcally , we establish that APPL endosomes represent the ﬁrst station in early endocytic trafﬁc both for a subset of endo - cytic vesicles derived from clathrin mediated endocytosis and for macropinosomes . A large fraction of APPL endosomes are precursors of classical PI3P positive EEA1 endosomes either directly or via the newly described WDFY2 - positive endosomes . Depletion of PI3P results in expansion of the APPL compartment and in enhanced growth factor receptor signaling , revealing a striking plasticity of the early endocytic pathway and a role for PI3P in regulating growth factor signaling . A Specialized Early Endosomal Station Recent reports by several groups have revealed the existence of distinct endosomal subpopulations , which are distinguished by the set of cytosolic proteins associated with them , their dynamic behavior or the cargo that they selectively transport ( Hayakawa et al . , 2006 ; Lakadamyali et al . , 2006 ; Miaczynska et al . , 2004a ) . However , it is still unclear whether some of these endo - somal subpopulations represent distinct stages of a common maturation pathway . We show here that a large fraction of APPL endosomes are directly upstream of PI3P positive endosomes , and represent an earlier stage of the Rab5 positive compartment . A previous study had emphasized the distinction between APPL and EEA1 endosomes ( Miaczynska et al . , 2004a ) . In agreement with these studies , we show here that these two types of endo - somes represent clearly distinct stages , with only partial and transient overlap . Ultimately , however , growth factor receptors which trafﬁc through APPL endosomes , such as the EGFR and TrkA , reach the EEA1 compartment ( Miaczynska et al . , 2004a ; Varsano et al . , 2006 ) .

On the other hand , the presence of APPL1 ﬁts with the known presence of Rab5 on both types of vesicles ( Miaczynska et al . , 2004a ; Porat - Shliom et al . , 2008 ) . The APPL endosome is clearly not the only entry site to the endocytic pathway from clathrin - coated pits . In fact , a signiﬁcant fraction of clathrin - coated pits do not acquire APPL1 following uncoating , underscoring their heterogeneous nature . This heterogeneity , involving differences in size , dynamics and molecular composition of the coat , may be controlled , at least in part , by the cargo which is being transported ( Ehrlich et al . , 2004 ; Jiang et al . , 2003 ; Puthenveedu and von Zastrow , 2006 ; Tosoni et al . , 2005 ) . Both nerve growth factor receptor ( TrkA ) and the EGFR bind the PTB domain of APPL1 ( Jones et al . , 2006 ; Lin et al . , 2006 ) and may play a role , along with Rab5 , in its recruitment . It is therefore of interest that EGF is preferentially internalized at the cell edge , where most APPL small endosomes are localized ( Jiang et al . , 2003 ; Lidke et al . , 2004 ; Sigismund et al . , 2005 ) . However , APPL binds several other receptors ( Hu et al . , 2003 ; Mao et al . , 2006 ) . Thus , the precise mechanism underlying the selective localizations of APPL on a subset of endocytic vesicles remains to be elucidated . Figure 5 .

A Phosphoinositide Switch within the Rab5 - Positive Domain The results presented here support a critical role of phosphoino - sitides in controlling the biogenesis and maturation of the APPL compartment . Both PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 are implicated in the nucleation and maturation of endocytic clathrin - coated pits and in the formation and dynamics of rufﬂes that underlie macro - pinosome formation ( Di Paolo and De Camilli , 2006 ; Zoncu et al . , 2007 ) . Hence , as also shown by our study ( Figures 2J and 2K ) , these two phosphoinositides are needed for the generation of APPL vesicles . However , both PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 undergo dephosphorylation at the 5 position in parallel with endocytosis ( Di Paolo and De Camilli , 2006 ) and thus are not needed for APPL1 recruitment to membranes . In fact , dissociation of the PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 reporters , GFP - PH Akt and GFP - PH Btk1 , slightly precedes the recruitment of APPL1 macropinosomes . Dissociation of APPL1 from endosomes tightly correlates with the recruitment of PI3P binding proteins , WDFY2 and EEA1 , therefore implicating PI3P generation as the switch that triggers this conversion ( Figure 6 ) . While the bulk of PI3P is synthesized by direct phosphorylation of PtdIns , an additional pool of PI3P on endosomes is thought to be generated by the sequential dephosphorylation of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 followed by PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 along the endocytic pathway ( Ivetac et al . , 2005 ; Shin et al . , 2005 ) . An attractive scenario would be a potential interaction of APPL with endosomes triggered by PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 following the action of aninositol 5 - phosphatase , andterminatedby dephosphorylation of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 by inositol 4 - phosphatases ( Ivetac et al . , 2005 ; Shin et al . , 2005 ) . However , the dissociation of GFP - PH Akt from endo - cytic vesicles prior to APPL1 binding challenges this possibility since GFP - PH Akt binds not only PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 but also PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 . The tight correlation ( at the end of the APPL stage ) between APPL1 dissociation and recruitment of PI3P binding proteins suggest that these two proteins may compete for a limited number of binding sites on Rab5 . This hypothesis is supported by three lines of evidence . First , acute depletion of PI3P from endosomes , using wortmannin or the rapamycin - dependent recruitment of an inositol 3 - phosphatase , not only inhibited shedding of APPL1 from the endosomal surface , but also promoted binding of APPL1 to endosomes which had lost PI3P binding proteins . Second , higher cellular levels of Rab5 resulted in increased colocalization between APPL1 and EEA1 on early endosomes . Third , PI3P did not seem to play a direct inhibitory role on the binding of APPL1 , provided that a sufﬁcient amount of GTP - Rab5 was present ( Figure 6 ) . A competition scenario is also favored by binding afﬁnities reported in the literature . While the measured dissociation constants ( K d ) of APPL1 and EEA1 for Rab5 are similar and fall in the low micromolar range ( Merithew et al . , 2003 ; Zhu et al . , 2007 ) , the afﬁnity of EEA1 binding to PI3P on liposomes was reported to be 20 - fold higher ( K d = 50 nM ) ( Gaullier et al . , 2000 ) . Therefore , the presence of PI3P on Rab5 positive endo - somes may potently stabilize binding of EEA1 and other dual Rab5 and PI3P effectors at the expense of APPL binding . Taken together , our ﬁndings provide a clear example of the property of phosphoinositides to amplify the Rab - based code of organelle identity ( Behnia and Munro , 2005 ; Di Paolo and De Camilli , 2006 ) . While Rab5 accompanies early endocytic membranes from the site of endocytosis to the EEA1 stage , the conversion of phosphoinositide species on such membranes generates subcompartments with different properties . Signaling from APPL Endosomes APPL was initially identiﬁed as an interactor of Akt , and further linked to signaling by its ability to bind to numerous receptors , either directly or via the small PDZ - containing adaptor GIPC ( Hu et al . , 2003 ; Lin et al . , 2006 ; Mao et al . , 2006 ; Wu et al . , 2006 ) . Accordingly , some colocalization of APPL with Akt was reported ( Schenck et al . , 2008 ) . Furthermore , loss of APPL was found to result indecreased activationofthe Akt and MAPKsignalingpath - ways ( Lin et al . , 2006 ; Mao et al . , 2006 ; Schenck et al . , 2008 ; Var - sano et al . , 2006 ) , a ﬁnding that was conﬁrmed here . Based on the localization of the PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ligands GFP - PH Akt and GFP - PH Btk1 , PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , aphosphoinositidethatplaysamajorroleintherecruit - ment and activation of Akt at the plasma membrane , does not appear to be present on APPL endosomes . However , full length Aktmayberetainedat , orrecruitedto , theendosomalsurfaceafter PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 dephosphorylation by its interaction with APPL . In our system , prolonged residency of EGFR in the APPL compartment increases not only Akt - dependent signaling but also MAPK signaling ( Lin et al . , 2006 ; Varsano et al . , 2006 ) , consistent with the requirement for endocytosis and endosomal trafﬁcking to achieve full activation of MAPK signaling ( Slessar - eva et al . , 2006 ; Vieira et al . , 1996 ; von Zastrow and Sorkin , 2007 ) . These data support a model where the residence time of growth factor receptors in APPL1 endosomes directly dictates signal strength . Figure 6 .

PI3P depletion or inhibition of hVps34 causes reversion back to APPL1 positive endosomes ( right ) . In contrast , increasing the amount of Rab5 allows the simultaneous presence of APPL1 and PI3P binding proteins on the same endosomes ( left ) . Cell 136 , 1110 – 1121 , March 20 , 2009 ª 2009 Elsevier Inc . 1119 In conclusion , our study identiﬁes APPL positive organelles as transient early endocytic intermediates downstream of a subset of vesicles generated by either clathrin - mediated endocytosis or by macropinocytosis and in the pathway leading to PI3P - positive early endosomes . It also reveals that conversion of APPL endo - somes to the PI3P stage is an event that may attenuate signaling in addition to triggering progression of cargo to downstream compartments . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Materials Plasmids , antibodies , and other reagents are listed in the Supplemental Data . Cell culture Cell culture , transfection , ﬁxation , and immunoﬂuorescence were performed as described ( Perera et al . , 2006 ) . Cells were seeded in glass - bottomed 35 mm dishes ( Mattek Corporation , Ashland , MA ) and imaged by epiﬂuores - cence , TIRF ( Olympus , Center Valley , PA ) or spinning disk confocal ( Perkin Elmer , Waltham , MA ) microscopy . See Supplemental Data . Total Internal Reﬂection Fluorescence Imaging Cells were imaged at 37 (cid:3) C using an Olympus objective - type IX - 70 inverted microscopy ﬁtted with a 60 3 1 . 45 N . A . TIRFM lens ( Olympus , Center Valley , PA ) , controlled by Andor iQ software ( Andor Technologies , Belfast , Ireland ) . Cells were typically imaged in two channels by sequential excitation at 0 . 25 Hz or 0 . 5 Hz , without binning , with 0 . 2 to 0 . 5 s exposures and detected with a back - illuminated Andor iXon 897 EMCCD camera ( 512 3 512 , 14 bit ; Andor Technologies ) . The depth of the evanescent ﬁeld was 100 nm . Image Analysis Analysis of ﬂuorescence spots in TIRF images was conducted as described ( Perera et al . , 2006 ; Zoncu et al . , 2007 ) . Brieﬂy , average ﬂuorescence / time plots were generated from 10 – 15 ﬂuorescent spots , which were subse - quently time - aligned by the conversion of one ﬂuorescent marker to another using Andor software ( Andor Technologies , Belfast , Ireland ) . Manual tracking of the conversion of ﬂuorescent spots ( macropinosomes ) was conducted using the ‘‘manual tracking’’ Image J plug - in ( National Institutes of Health ) . Particle count was conducted using Image J as previously described ( Zoncu et al . , 2007 ) . All data were analyzed for signiﬁcance using student’s t test . Rapalogue - Mediated Depletion of Phosphoinositides Experiments involving rapalogue - mediated recruitment of an inositol 5 - phos - phatase to the plasma membrane were performed as described ( Zoncu et al . , 2007 ) . For PI3P depletion from Rab5 - positive endosomes , cells were transiently transfected with CFP - FKBP 3 2 - Rab5 , mRFP - FRB - MTM1 ( kind gift of B . Larijani ) , and a GFP - tagged endosomal marker ( APPL1 , WDFY2 or EEA1 ) and imaged by TIRF sequentially at 488 and 568 nm . After 10 min , 500 nM rapalogue ( AP 021967 , Ariad Pharmaceuticals , Cambridge , MA ) was added , and changes in ﬂuorescent protein distribution were monitored for a further 20 min . Cell - Signaling Assays Cells were transiently transfected with GFP - FKBP 3 2 - Rab5 and mRFP - FRB - MTM1 or mRFP - FRB - MTM1 C375S and treated with 500 nM rapalogue at 37 (cid:3) C for 15 min in serum free medium . Subsequently , an equal volume of serum free medium containing 3 ng / ml of EGF was added to the dishes ( yielding a ﬁnal concentration of 1 . 5 ng / ml of EGF ) and incubated at 37 (cid:3) C . At different time points cells were washed in cold PBS and lysed in lysis buffer ( 1 % SDS , 25mMTris [ pH7 . 4 ] , 150mMNaCl , 1mMEDTAcontainingProtease Inhibitor cocktail ) prior to western blot analysis .
