This Special Interest Group ( SIG ) aims to create a space for discussion , connection and camaraderie for researchers working with queer populations , queer people in research , and those using queer theory to inform their work . We aim to facilitate a broad - ranging , inclusive discussion of where queer HCI research goes next . CCS CONCEPTS • Social and professional topics → Gender ; Sexual orientation ; KEYWORDS Queer Theory , Queer Practice , Queer Interaction , Queer Identity . Defining “Queer” “Queer : colloq . ( orig . U . S . ) . Of a person : . . . denot - ing or relating to a sexual or gender identity that does not correspond to established ideas of sexuality and gender , especially heterosexual norms . ” [ 1 ] “Well , yes , “gay” is great . It has its place . But when a lot of lesbians and gay men wake up in the morning we feel angry and disgusted , not gay . So we’ve chosen to call ourselves queer . Using “queer” is a way of reminding us how we are perceived by the rest of the world . ” [ 19 ] “Queer is by definition whatever is at odds with the normal , the legimate , the dominant . There is nothing in particular to which it necessarily refers . It is an identity without an essence . ” [ 9 ] “Queer , if it names anything , names a critical impulse that can never , must never , settle . ” [ 14 ] In recent years , the HCI community has turned substantial attention to the issues that affect queer communities , especially as they relate to dating , hookups [ 2 , 5 ] and identity management [ 4 , 7 , 10 ] . Simultaneously , there is an increased awareness within HCI that the process of queering—the playful , subversive troubling of existing systems—is an increasingly useful tool [ 17 , 20 ] . This tool may become even more important as the societal need to trouble and subvert these systems , which have the potential to either reinforce or undermine unquestioned and dangerous norms [ 11 ] , becomes more widely apparent . Queer work in all its forms has proved to be an important first step towards being inclusive of a diverse and increasingly culturally - relevant area of society , and an important exercise in being reflexive as a design community . However , the queer theory strand of Queer HCI has been mostly theoretical to this point , while the empirical strand has largely been restricted to dating and disclosure contexts , despite the fact that queer experiences range far beyond these topics . Both strands of Queer HCI have also developed largely in parallel to one another .

SIG Purpose By bringing together a community of curi - ous HCI activists with interest in queer iden - tity , queering , and subversion , we can combine strengths to push the boundaries of research with and by queer populations and what it can contribute to the larger CHI community . A SIG at CHI 2019 , where key researchers meet and present related work , provides the ideal venue for addressing these issues . QUEERING HCI Queer HCI , in its theory - and queering - based strand , works to analyse and challenge the structures and norms underlying sexism , i . e . the rigid classification of humanity into static forms , through troubling [ 17 ] . This kind of work , as well as important definitional work such as Rode’s approach to conceptualising gender as a more fluid , flexible and produced matter [ 20 ] , build a pathway towards different topics that benefit from a queer lens [ 13 ] . Additionally , practical calls have been made for using the queer strategy of troubling to design against a toxic status quo [ 11 ] . Queer ( ing ) research has the potential to tackle negative impacts and assumptions in HCI such as normalisation strategies in technology , most prominently gender binarism 1 in data , meta - data 1 The predominant ideology , often found in HCI , that conceptualises gender as a strictly binary construct [ 20 ] . and algorithms [ 12 ] . Gender recognition technologies have also been investigated regarding issues of safety for trans people [ 21 ] or the inherent reductionist binarism in the approach , which is not only inseparably tied to surveillance and normativity , but also externally assigns gender identities instead of acknowledging gender as a ( self - ) affirmative personal statement [ 15 ] . Queering as a lens has much potential for making HCI research , on queer populations and on technology more generally , more reflexive and inclusive . HCI RESEARCH ON AND BY QUEERS At the same time , more traditional empirical work on queer populations has provided in - depth accounts of queer life experiences as they intersect with technology , while also serving as an illustrative test case for HCI more generally due to the complexities of identity and community formation within these groups [ 6 ] . However , prior studies have largely focused on gay men [ 8 , 10 , 16 ] , while the queer community is , in fact , a highly diverse and heterogenous group [ 18 ] . Recent work by junior scholars has begun to expand to questions of health and wellbeing [ 7 ] , and has begun to cover more diverse slices of the queer landscape ( e . g . [ 3 , 4 ] ) including negotiating a queer identity as researcher with the material aspects of conducting research with people [ 22 ] , bringing up new challenges around recruiting , theorizing , and framing these more widely - scoped projects . In essence , empirical queer HCI is currently undergoing its own process of queering and subsequent expansion - it is the perfect time , then , for these two parts of the CHI queer community to compare notes and forge partnerships .
