Ectopic expression of the dynamin CMT mutants 555 (cid:2) 3 and K562E caused an approximately 50 % decrease in serum stimulation - dependent lamellipodia formation ; however , only K562E caused aberrations in the actin cytoskeleton . Immunoﬂuorescence analysis showed that the K562E mutation resulted in the disappearance of radially aligned actin bundles and the simultaneous appearance of F - actin clusters . Live - cell imaging analyses showed F - actin polymers of decreased length assembled into immobile clusters in K562E - expressing cells . The K562E dynamin mutant colocalized with the F - actin clusters , whereas its colocalization with clathrin - coated pit marker proteins was decreased . Essentially the same results were obtained using another cell line , HeLa and NG108 - 15 cells .

Introduction Charcot - Marie - Tooth disease ( CMT ) is a hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy [ 1 ] . Two types of CMT show an autoso - mal dominant inheritance pattern , namely CMT1 and CMT2 . CMT1 is characterized by demyelination and nerve conduction deﬁcits , whereas CMT2 results from axonal abnormalities lead - ing to decreased amplitude of neuronal transmission . There are four kinds of intermediate subtypes , namely , dominant interme - diate ( DI ) - CMTA , DI - CMTB , DI - CMTC and DI - CMTD , which show http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . neulet . 2016 . 06 . 030 0304 - 3940 / © 2016 The Authors .

Yamada et al . / Neuroscience Letters 628 ( 2016 ) 179 – 185 demyelination and aberrant axonal forms . Dynamin 2 is one of the disease - causing genes in DI - CMTB [ 2 ] . Dynamin in mammalian cells is classiﬁed into three isoforms designated as dynamin 1 , 2 , and 3 [ 3 ] . Dynamin 1 is mainly localized in neurons , whereas dynamin 3 is highly expressed in neurons , lung and testis . Dynamin 2 is ubiquitously expressed . Dynamins have common functional domains including a GTPase domain at the N - terminus , a middle domain , a Pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domain , a GTPase effector domain ( GED ) , and a proline / arginine rich domain ( PRD ) located at the C - terminus [ 4 ] . Dynamins are involved in the process of membrane ﬁssion during endocytosis [ 4 ] . Dynamins also regulate dynamics of cytoskeleton including actin [ 4 ] and microtubule [ 5 ] . Dynamin participates in the for - mation of actin - rich structures , including lamellipodia and dorsal membrane rufﬂes , invadopodia , podosomes , growth cones , and phagocytic cups [ 4 ] . Dynamins directly and indirectly control actin dynamics . Actin bundling mediated by dynamin and cortactin , an F - actin binding protein , stabilizes growth cone ﬁlopodia [ 6 ] . Crosslinking of F - actin by dynamin and cortactin is involved in intracellular F - actin organization [ 7 ] . Furthermore , dynamin alone directly binds to actin ﬁlaments and changes the higher order struc - ture of F - actin [ 8 ] . Eight CMT - associated mutations in dynamin 2 have been reported to date [ 9 ] . These mutations occur mainly at the PH domain , which is a binding motif for phosphoinositide . Mutations have also been detected in the middle and PRD domains [ 9 ] . Analy - sis of ﬁbroblasts derived from CMT patients or cells expressing CMT mutant dynamin 2 showed that mutations in the PH domain lead to defective endocytosis of surface receptors , including EGF and trans - ferrin receptors [ 10 , 11 ] . In particular , the dynamin 2 K562E mutant severely inhibits endocytosis [ 11 ] . The dynamin 2 CMT mutation 555 (cid:2) 3 results in alterations in the microtubule cytoskeleton [ 2 ] , which in turn affect microtubule - dependent membrane transport [ 5 ] . Considering physiological signiﬁcance of dynamin in the reg - ulation of actin , dynamin CMT mutants remain to be analyzed focusing on actin dynamics . In the present study , we analyzed the effects of two selected dynamin 2 CMT mutants , 555 (cid:2) 3 and K562E , on intracellular actin dynamics by immunoﬂuorescence and live imaging with Total Internal Reﬂection Fluorescence Microscopy ( TIRFM ) . 2 . Materials and methods 2 . 1 . Antibodies Polyclonal rabbit anti - V5 antibody ( AB3792 ) and mouse mono - clonal antibody against (cid:2) - adaptin ( AP - 2 ) ( CP46 ) were purchased from Life Technologies ( Carlsbad , CA ) . Mouse monoclonal anti - clathrin heavy chain antibody ( MA1 - 065 ) was from Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ( Waltham , MA ) . Alexa 488 - or Rhodamine Red X - conjugated anti - rabbit IgG or anti - mouse IgG , and Alexa Fluor 488 - or Rhodamine - phalloidin were purchased from Life Technologies ( Carlsbad , CA ) . 2 . 2 . cDNA constructs Rat dynamin 2 wild - type ( WT ) , 555 (cid:2) 3 or K562E were cloned into pcDNA4 V5 / His as previously described by Tanabe and Takei [ 5 ] . Rat dynamin 2 WT was subcloned into pIRES2 - DsRed2 as an EcoRI - SmaI fragment ( Clontech Laboratories , Inc . , Santa Clara , CA ) . Mutations were introduced with QuikChange II XL ( Agilent Tech - nologies , Santa Clara , CA ) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions . 2 . 3 . Cell culture and transfection U2OS ( ATCC No ; HTB96 ) cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s mod - iﬁed Eagle’s medium ( DMEM ; Life Technologies ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ; Life Technologies ) at 37 ◦ C in humidiﬁed air with a 5 % CO 2 atmosphere . For transfection , U2OS cells were cultured in a six - well plate at a density of 0 . 5 × 10 5 / well and transfected with 0 . 5 (cid:3) g of cDNA of dynamin 2 WT , 555 (cid:2) 3 or K562E cloned into a pIRES2 - DsRed2 expression vector ( Clontech Laboratories , Inc . ) using Lipofectamine 2000 , and then cultured for 32 h . The cells were cultured with 0 . 2 % FBS / DMEM for more than 16 h and stimulated with 10 % serum for 40 min , and the cells were ﬁxed and stained as described below . To examine colocalization of dynamin with F - actin cluster , AP - 2 or clathrin , U2OS cells were transfected with 0 . 5 – 1 . 5 (cid:3) g pcDNA4 V5 / His harboring dynamin 2 WT or mutants . Then , serum - stimulated cells were ﬁxed and stained . 2 . 4 . Fluorescent microscopy Cells were ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde and stained by immunoﬂuorescence as described previously [ 6 ] . Transfected cells were identiﬁed by DsRed ﬂuorescence . Samples were exam - ined using a spinning disc confocal microscope system ( CSU10 , Yokogawa Electric Co . , Tokyo , Japan ) combined with an inverted microscope ( IX - 71 , Olympus Optical Co . , Ltd . , Tokyo , Japan ) and a CoolSNAP - HQ camera ( Roper Industries , Sarasota , FL ) . The confocal system was controlled by MetaMorph Software ( Molecular Devices , Sunnyvale , CA ) . Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop CS3 or Illustrator CS3 software when it is necessary . 2 . 5 . Live imaging U2OS cells were co - transfected with 0 . 5 (cid:3) g LifeAct - GFP2 ( ibidi GmbH , Planegg , Germany ) and 0 . 5 (cid:3) g pIRES2 - DsRed2 harboring dynamin 2 WT or K562E . For live imaging , the transfected cells were cultured and stimulated with 10 % FBS as described above . The stimulated cells were captured using TIRFM . Dynamin 2 WT or mutant - expressing cells were identiﬁed by DsRed ﬂuorescence . Time - lapsed images were acquired with an inverted microscope ( IX - 71 ) and a CoolSNAP - Pro camera . Images were automatically captured every 10 s and processed by MetaMorph software . 2 . 6 . Morphometry To investigate lamellipodia formation , cells were stained with Alexa 488 Fluor - phalloidin , and analyzed by ﬂuorescence confocal microscopy . F - Actin - rich protrusive membrane sheets at the lead - ing edge were deﬁned as lamellipodia [ 12 ] . Cells with lamellipodia were counted . Ratio value of the number of cells with lamellipodia to total number of counted cells was expressed . F - actin clusters were identiﬁed by visual inspection , and the number of F - actin clusters was counted from images of cells stained with Alexa Fluor 488 - phalloidin . Average number of F - actin clus - ters per cell was expressed . Data were analyzed in 33 – 53 cells from three experiments . All morphometric data were expressed as the mean ± S . E . M . 2 . 7 . Statistical analysis Data were analyzed for statistical signiﬁcance using Kaleida - Graph software for the Macintosh ( version 4 . 1 ) ( Synergy Software Inc . , Essex Junction , VT , USA ) . Analysis of variance and Tukey’s hon - est signiﬁcant difference post hoc test were applied for more than H . Yamada et al . / Neuroscience Letters 628 ( 2016 ) 179 – 185 181 two different groups , and Student’s t - test was applied for two dif - ferent groups . P values of < 0 . 01 ( * * ) were considered signiﬁcant . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . Expression of the dynamin 2 CMT mutant K562E results in aberrant actin ﬁlament structures To investigate the effect of dynamin 2 mutations associated with CMT on the actin cytoskeleton , two dynamin 2 CMT mutants , namely 555 (cid:2) 3 and K562E , were expressed in U2OS cells and intracellular F - actin distribution was analyzed ( Fig . 1A ) . DsRed2 was co - expressed to identify cells expressing the exogenous pro - teins . The actin cytoskeleton is remodeled in U2OS cells upon serum stimulation , which facilitates observation of intracellular actin dynamics [ 7 , 13 ] . Upon serum stimulation , U2OS cells formed typical lamellipo - dia , an extended membrane protrusion . The lamellipodia were supported by higher order actin structures , including radially and transversely arranged actin bundles ( Fig . 1Ba ) . Expression of dynamin 2 WT had no visible effect on lamellipodia forma - tion or the structure of the actin cytoskeleton compared to those of control cells ( Fig . 1Bb ) . By contrast , in 555 (cid:2) 3 - expressing and K562E - expressing cells , lamellipodia formation , as determined by the method described in Syriani et al . [ 12 ] , was inhibited by approx - imately 50 % ( Fig . 1C ) , whereas the effect on actin structures differed in each mutant In K562E expressing cells , radially arranged actin bundles became undetectable concomitant with the appearance of F - actin clusters ( Fig . 1Bd and D ) , whereas actin structures remained unchanged in 555 (cid:2) 3 - expressing cells ( Fig . 1Bc and D ) . A decrease in stress ﬁbers , actin bundles and the appearance of F - actin clus - ters were also observed in the absence of serum stimulation in dynamin 2 K562E expressing cells ( Supplementary Fig . 1A and B ) . These results indicated a marked effect of the K562E mutation on the actin cytoskeleton . Based on the strong effect of the K562E mutation on F - actin distribution , we next examined the subcellular localization of the K562E mutant by immunoﬂuorescence microscopy . WT dynamin 2 showed a ﬁne punctate distribution that partially overlapped with F - actin ( 5 . 9 ± 1 . 0 % ) , consistent with a previous report [ 13 ] ( Fig . 2A upper panels and 2B ) . In contrast , K562E mutant - expressing cells showed colocalization of dynamin 2 with F - actin clusters by 50 . 2 ± 3 . 4 % ( Fig . 2A lower panels and 2B ) . Since dynamin 2 func - tions in endocytosis at endocytic pits together with clathrin and the clathrin adaptor AP - 2 , we next examined the effect of dynamin 2 mutations on the colocalization of these proteins . Approximately 50 % of dynamin 2 WT positive puncta were positive for AP - 2 ( Fig . 2C and D ) or clathrin ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) , whereas colocalization was decreased to 20 % in K562E - expressing cells ( Fig . 2C , D and Sup - plementary Fig . 2 ) . Unlike F - actin , the distribution of AP - 2 was not affected by the dynamin mutation . These results suggested that dynamin 2 K562E has a greater effect on actin dynamics than on the endocytic machinery . To conﬁrm that the effect of dynamin 2 K562E on actin cytoskeleton is intrinsic , the same mutant was expressed in HeLa cells . The expression of dynamin 2 K562E in HeLa cells also induced defective of actin bundles , and the appearance of F - actin clusters ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . In addition , the colocalization of F - actin clusters with dynamin 2 K562E similar to the case in U2OS cells was also observed ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . In addition , the aberrant F - actin clusters were also observed in K562E mutant expressing NG108 - 15 cells , mouse neuroblastoma x rat glioma cell line ( Sup - plementary Fig . 5 ) . These results suggest that the effect of dynamin 2 K562E on actin cytoskeleton is intrinsic in the CMT mutant . 3 . 2 . Expression of the K562E mutant affects actin dynamics The aberrant F - actin distribution and defective lamellipodia formation in K562E mutant - expressing cells ( Fig . 1 ) suggested a potential effect of the mutation on actin dynamics near the plasma membrane . To characterize the effect of K562E expression on actin dynamics , live imaging of intracellular F - actin was performed using TIRFM . Long linear F - actin ﬁlaments showed twitching movements at the cell periphery ( Supplementary movie S1 ) and assembled into radially aligned thick actin bundles at approximately 20 min after serum stimulation in dynamin WT - expressing cells ( Fig . 3A , upper panels ) . Transverse F - actin bundles were also observed ( Fig . 3A upper panel at 36 min ) , consistent with the results of the phalloidin - staining experiment shown in Fig . 1Bb . In K562E - expressing cells , F - actin ﬁlaments were short and visualized as dots at the cell periphery ( Fig . 3A , lower panels ) . At approximately 20 min after serum stimulation , the short actin ﬁlaments assembled , and clear F - actin clusters were formed at approximately 30 min in dynamin 2 K562E - expressing cells ( Sup - plementary movie S2 , Fig . 3A , lower panels , arrowheads ) . The F - actin clusters were immobile and persisted throughout the obser - vation . Radially aligned F - actin bundles were almost undetectable , whereas the formation of transversely arranged F - actin bundles was similar to that in dynamin 2 WT - expressing cells ( Fig . 3A lower panel at 36 min ) . Higher magniﬁcation images ( Fig . 3B ) show actin bundles inter - secting at right angles in dynamin 2 WT - expressing cells , whereas in dynamin 2 K562E - expressing cells , F - actin clusters consisted of tangled actin ﬁlaments that were not connected to the transverse actin bundles ( Fig . 3B , right ) . These results indicated that the K562E mutation disrupted actin dynamics at the plasma membrane . 4 . Discussion Dynamin 2 is the disease - causing gene for DI - CMTB [ 2 ] . Dynamin 2 CMT mutations disturb clathrin - mediated endocyto - sis of transferrin or EGF receptors [ 2 , 10 , 11 ] and result in dynamic instability of microtubules [ 5 ] . In the present study , we explored the effect of two dynamin 2 CMT mutants , 555 (cid:2) 3 or K562E , on the actin dynamics . Expression of the dynamin 2 K562E mutant in U2OS cells signiﬁcantly inhib - ited the formation of radially aligned actin bundles and caused a loss of higher order actin structures , which consist of actin bundles crossing at right angles ( Fig . 1 ) . These changes were accompanied by the appearance of F - actin clusters composed of tangled actin ﬁlaments ( Fig . 1 ) . Live imaging analyses showed shorter and less dynamic actin ﬁlaments in K562E mutant - expressing cells than in WT dynamin - expressing cells upon serum stimulation ( Fig . 3 ) . The decreased formation of lamellipodia in K562E - expressing cells may have been caused by these changes of actin dynamics ( Fig . 1 ) . Myelination consists of the coating of axons with layers of myelin derived from Schwann cells in peripheral neurons or oligo - dendrocytes in central neurons [ 14 ] . Recent studies showed that myelination requires actin remodeling in Schwann cells [ 15 ] and oligodendrocytes [ 16 ] . Dynamins are directly and indirectly impli - cated in actin dynamics [ 17 ] . Actin bundling by dynamin and cortactin , an F - actin binding protein , stabilizes growth cone ﬁlopo - dia [ 6 ] . Intracellular F - actin organization involves crosslinking of F - actin by dynamin and cortactin [ 7 ] . In addition , dynamin alone directly binds actin ﬁlaments , which changes the higher order structure of F - actin [ 8 ] . It is conceivable that dynamin CMT muta - tions affect actin dynamics during the process of myelination . This hypothesis is supported by evidence that dynamin 2 CMT muta - tions , including K562E , suppress myelination in Schwann cells [ 11 ] . 182 H .

( D ) Colocalization of the dynamin 2 WT or K562E mutant with AP - 2 . The ratio of dynamin 2 K562E mutant positive puncta overlapped with AP - 2 to total K562E mutant positive dots was quantiﬁed using Metamorph image analysis software . ( * * : p < 0 . 01 ) . The K562E mutation leads to severe inhibition of endocytic activity [ 2 , 10 , 11 ] , as shown by defects in the recruitment of the mutant protein to the plasma membrane [ 18 ] . In the present study , the recruitment of the dynamin 2 K562E mutant to endocytic pit was drastically decreased ( Fig . 2 and Supplementary Fig . 2 ) , supporting previous ﬁndings . Considering that actin remodeling is implicated in clathrin - mediated endocytosis [ 19 ] , perturbation of actin dynamics by the K562E mutation may contribute to its inhibitory effect on endocytosis . The 555 (cid:2) 3 mutation was shown to cause instability of tubulin dynamics but not actin dynamics [ 5 ] . In the present study , 555 (cid:2) 3 mutant - expressing cells showed defective lamellipodia formation with no obvious change of actin distribution . The inhibitory effect on lamellipodia formation could be attributed to tubulin disarray . U2OS and HeLa cells were used in this study to assess the effect of the dynamin CMT - mutants on actin dynamics . These cells are widely utilized in dynamin - dependent cellular function . In addi - tion , we found that NG108 - 15 cell , a mouse neuroblastoma x rat glioma hybrid cell line , showed similar aberrant dynamin and actin localization . However , the cell dependent - effect of dynamin CMT mutant in clathrin - mediated endocytosis has been observed [ 11 ] . Analyses of other cell types including neurons , Schwann cells are required for investigating causality of illness for CMT mutation in the future study . 184 H .

In conclusion , we show for the ﬁrst time that expression of the dynamin 2 CMT mutant K562E leads to aberrant F - actin distribu - tion as well as lamellipodia formation . These results indicate that disturbance of actin dynamics in dynamin 2 CMT mutants should be considered as a potential mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of CMT .
