We aimed to quantify the epidemic drivers of SARS - CoV - 2 dynamics in the Dominican Republic , an upper - middle income country of 10 . 8 million people , and assess the impact of the vaccination campaign implemented in February 2021 in saving lives and averting hospitalisations . We used an age - structured , multi - variant transmission dynamic model to characterise epidemic drivers in the Dominican Republic and explore counterfactual scenarios around vaccination coverage and population mobility . We fit the model to reported deaths , hospital bed occupancy , ICU bed occupancy and seroprevalence data until December 2021 and simulated epidemic trajectories under different counterfactual vaccination scenarios . We estimate that vaccination averted 5040 hospital admissions ( 95 % CrI : 4750 - 5350 ) , 1500 ICU admissions ( 95 % CrI : 1420 - 1590 ) and 544 deaths ( 95 % CrI : 488 - 606 ) in the first 6 months of the campaign . We also found that early vaccination with Sinovac - CoronaVac was preferable to delayed vaccination using a product with higher efficacy . We investigated the trade - off between changes in vaccination coverage and population mobility to understand how much relaxation of social distancing measures vaccination was able to ‘buy’ in the later stages of a pandemic . We found that if no vaccination had occurred , an additional decrease of 10 - 20 % in population mobility would have been required to maintain the same death and hospitalisation outcomes . We found SARS - CoV - 2 transmission dynamics in the Dominican Republic were driven by substantial accumulation of immunity during the first two years of the pandemic but that , despite this , vaccination was essential in enabling a return to pre - pandemic mobility levels without incurring considerable additional morbidity and mortality . Introduction During 2020 - 22 , many countries experienced a significant burden of COVID - 19 and imposed non - pharmaceutical interventions ( NPIs ) aiming to control SARS - CoV - 2 transmission . Despite this , countries experienced markedly different epidemic dynamics , mediated by a complex interplay of factors including population behaviour , government interventions , the introduction of new variants , the roll - out of .

Serological surveys have proven crucial to understand global and national landscapes of population immunity , as well as indicating the extent of prior exposure to SARS - CoV - 2 ( 1 ) . Some countries pursued an elimination strategy throughout the pre - Omicron era , with stringent public health interventions resulting in low levels of seroprevalence towards the end of 2021 . For example , in Hong Kong , serosurveillance studies found < 1 % of sera tested was positive for anti - N SARS - CoV - 2 IgG prior to March 2021 ( 2 ) . Other countries , such as the UK and many EU countries , saw epidemic waves linked to the strengthening and relaxing of public health interventions , alongside the emergence of more transmissible variants . In England , approximately 20 % of the population were estimated to have been infected with SARS - CoV - 2 by July 2021 ( 3 ) . In contrast , SARS - CoV - 2 transmission was largely unmitigated in some settings such as in Manaus , Brazil , where 76 % of the population are thought to have been infected by October 2020 ( 4 ) . Latin America and the Caribbean was a global hotspot for SARS - CoV - 2 transmission during 2020 - 21 , prior to the emergence of the Omicron variant , which caused large epidemics globally ( 5 , 6 ) . The Dominican Republic is an upper - middle income country with a population of 10 . 8 million , which shares the island of Hispañola in the Caribbean with Haiti . They reported their first case of COVID - 19 on the 1st of March 2020 , which was followed by the imposition of strict public health measures . These began to be relaxed in July 2021 and were mostly lifted with the reopening of schools and relaxation of curfew measures in October 2021 . In the first two years of the pandemic , the Dominican Republic experienced four waves of transmission : the first peaked in August 2020 , with cases increasing again in November 2020 before a second peak in January 2021 . A third wave of transmission took place over the summer of 2021 , following the introduction of more transmissible variants , including Mu , with cases rising sharply to peak in July 2021 . Following the introduction of the Delta variant , a fourth wave took place in October and November 2021 . A nationally representative serological survey involving 6683 individuals from 3832 households took place between June and September 2021 ( 7 ) . Results from the serological survey estimated that 76 . 6 % ( 95 % CI 70 . 1 – 82 . 5 ) of the population had been previously infected by the study midpoint . This vastly exceeded earlier estimates constructed from coarse reported data for the Dominican Republic , and the wider region of Latin America and the Caribbean ( 8 ) . The government of the Dominican Republic launched a national COVID - 19 vaccination programme on 16th February 2021 initially focusing on health - care professionals and then following a three - phase age - based approach . Booster vaccination for highly vulnerable individuals began in July 2021 , with the Dominican Republic being the first country in the Americas to approve vaccination with a third dose . Approximately 90 % of vaccine doses administered were Sinovac - CoronaVac ( an inactivated viral vaccine ) , with Oxford / AstraZeneca vaccine ( ChAdOx1 - S , an adenovirus vector vaccine ) and Pfizer / BioNTech ( BNT162b2 , mRNA vaccine ) also administered ( 7 ) . By the current study’s endpoint ( 15th December 2021 ) , 62 % of the population had received at least one dose of a COVID - 19 vaccine and 50 % had received two doses . Mathematical models have been used throughout the pandemic to provide decision - support to policy makers through estimation of key epidemiological parameters , forecasts of future incidence , projections of epidemic trajectories under different scenarios , and quantification of the impact of non - pharmaceutical interventions . However , despite regular and in - depth modelling decision - support for high - income countries , there has been a lack of equivalent modelling analysis to understand transmission and control in .

To address this gap , we used an age - structured transmission dynamic model to quantify the drivers of epidemic dynamics in the Dominican Republic during the first two years of the pandemic , and to assess the impact of the vaccination campaign on COVID - 19 hospitalisations and deaths . Methods Data Figure 1 : Map of the study setting and time - series of COVID - 19 cases . Figure showing a map of the Caribbean with the location of the Dominican Republic shown in a box ( A ) , a map of the Dominican Republic showing clusters sampled in the 2021 serosurvey ( B ) , and daily COVID - 19 cases in the Dominican Republic ( bars ) and the 7 - day moving average ( line ) from March 2020 – January 2022 ( C ) . The shaded grey area indicates the timing of the serological survey . For this analysis we incorporated multiple data streams . Aggregated daily reported deaths were collected from the Dominican Republic’s COVID - 19 Dashboard . Aggregated daily hospital and ICU bed occupancy were scraped from daily COVID - 19 bulletins published by the Ministerio de Salud Pública y .

We also used serological data from a nationally representative SARS - CoV - 2 seroprevalence survey undertaken between June - October 2021 . Further details of survey methodology and findings are available elsewhere ( 7 ) . We used data on the daily number of second vaccine doses distributed in the population ( 18 ) . To obtain estimates of age - stratified vaccination rates , we assumed that daily doses were evenly distributed between eligible age groups as per the government’s vaccination program ( Supplementary Table S . 9 ) . If an eligible age group became fully vaccinated during the vaccination allocation , remaining vaccine doses were distributed between the remaining eligible age groups or , if all were fully vaccinated , between adults > 20 , mimicking the vaccination of younger health care workers or those with chronic health conditions . Estimated vaccination coverage by age group over time is shown in Figure 2 . Figure 2 : Google mobility data , SARS - CoV - 2 sequence data , and estimated vaccination coverage by age Panel A shows Google mobility data showing the proportional change in population mobility in different locations relative to a pre - pandemic baseline , panel B shows the frequency of SARS - CoV - 2 sequences from the Dominican Republic on GISAID by variant and panel C shows estimated vaccination coverage by age assuming vaccine doses were evenly distributed between eligible age groups . .

We used covidM , an age - stratified , deterministic , compartmental model originally developed to model the effects of NPIs on SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in the UK , and described fully elsewhere ( 19 , 24 , 25 ) . In brief , covidM is structured into 5 - year age groups , with individuals moving from a susceptible state ( S ) to an exposed state ( E ) and then either to a pre - clinical and clinical infected state ( I p followed by I c ) or a sub - clinical infected state ( I s ) and finally to a recovered state ( R ) . The model explicitly considers two variants of SARS - CoV - 2 ; wild - type and B . 1 . 617 . 2 ( Delta ) , while the introduction of other variants in the Dominican Republic in the intervening period ( which include Mu , Gamma and Alpha ) is captured through a gradual increase in transmissibility in the first half of 2021 , following a logistic function . We fit the model to daily reported deaths , daily hospital and ICU bed occupancy and a cross - sectional seroprevalence estimate from June - October 2021 . We fit the model using data until 15th December 2021 , when cases began to increase due to the Omicron variant , and only simulate epidemic trajectories until this point . Hospitalisation , ICU admission and death are modelled as observation processes according to age - specific infection - severe ratios , infection - critical ratios and infection - fatality ratios based on estimates from the literature . These are adjusted on the log odds scale by several fitted parameters and delays from infection to hospitalisation , ICU admission and death are estimated during the model fitting process . We assume that the observed number of deaths , hospital bed occupancy and ICU bed occupancy are distributed according to a negative binomial distribution , with the overdispersion parameter estimated during the .

We used a skew - normal likelihood for seroprevalence with the same mean and 95 % confidence interval as reported for the data evaluated for the period of the serosurvey . We consider a central waning assumption corresponding to 15 % loss of post - infection protection after 1 year , and conduct sensitivity analysis around different waning assumptions ( Supplementary Tables S . 6 and S . 7 ) . Full details on model equations , fixed and fitted model parameters can be found in Supplementary Tables S1 - 3 . Vaccination parameters We also incorporated information on SARS - CoV - 2 vaccination in the Dominican Republic , using data collated by Our World in Data ( 10 ) . Fully vaccinated individuals moved to a vaccinated model compartment ( V ) from which , subject to vaccine waning parameters , they can move to the exposed state ( E ) or directly to a sub - clinical infection ( I s ) . We assume vaccinated individuals have a lower probability of clinical or sub - clinical infection but that , once infected , they have the same infectiousness as non - vaccinated individuals . We model vaccine efficacy against infection ( 𝑣𝑒𝑖 ) , which determines the probability that a vaccinated individual enters the Exposed compartment , and vaccine efficacy against disease given infection ( 𝑣𝑒𝑑 | 𝑖 ) , which determines the probability that a vaccinated individual develops sub - clinical or asymptomatic disease directly ( see Figure 3 ) . As 90 % of the primary course of vaccinations given in the Dominican Republic were CoronaVac ( Sinovac COVID - 19 vaccine ) we used vaccination efficacy parameters based on the literature available for this vaccine product . We model differing vaccine efficacy by strain but assume the same vaccine efficacy across age groups . Note that we do not directly model vaccine efficacy against hospitalisation or death . Mobility To estimate changes in population behaviour during the pandemic we used population mobility captured by Google’s COVID - 19 Community Mobility Reports as a proxy . We mapped changes in mobility to changes in contact rates using the relationship between mobility and contact survey data found in the UK ( 19 , 41 ) . The representativeness of Google mobility data is dependent on the proportion of the population with smartphones using Google products . As this differs substantially between the UK and the Dominican Republic , we infer a weighting between UK - adjusted contact rates and pre - pandemic baseline contact rates in the Dominican Republic , fitting a separate weighting parameter for each year of the simulation period ( 35 ) . We found the UK - adjusted value was given more weight in the first year of the pandemic than the second , suggesting that the relationship between measured population mobility and contact rates changed during the pandemic . We considered four categories of contacts : home , work , school and other . School contact rates were set to zero during school closures and school holiday periods . Model fitting We performed Bayesian inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo to estimate model parameters . We used the Differential Evolution Markov Chain Monte Carlo ( DE - MCMC ) algorithm which combines a .

Here , multiple Markov chains are run in parallel and learn from one another to determine the scale and orientation of the proposal distribution , which allows for more efficient exploration of a complex parameter space than traditional Metropolis - Hastings algorithms , particularly when considering correlated parameters . Model convergence was assessed using trace plots of MCMC chains and the Rhat statistic ( 27 ) . Counterfactual analysis We conducted counterfactual scenario analysis using the fitted model to simulate epidemic trajectories under different scenarios . We considered five key scenarios with changes applied from the beginning of the vaccination campaign ( 15th February 2021 ) until the end of the analysis period . Table 1 : Counterfactual scenarios Scenario Description 1 . No vaccination No vaccine doses distributed 2 . Vaccination using a vaccine with a Pfizer / BioNTech efficacy profile Original vaccine dose distribution but with overall vaccine efficacy against infection of 0 . 85 for WT and 0 . 8 for Delta , and overall vaccine efficacy against disease of 0 . 9 for WT and 0 . 81 for Delta . 3 . Delayed vaccination using a vaccine with a Pfizer / BioNTech efficacy profile Vaccine efficacy parameters as in 3 . With a delay in vaccine dose distribution of 2 months ( vaccination from 15th April 2021 ) . 4 . Vaccination using a vaccine with an Oxford / AstraZeneca efficacy profile Original vaccine dose distribution but with overall vaccine efficacy against infection of 0 . 75 for WT and 0 . 63 for Delta , and overall vaccine efficacy against disease of 0 . 8 for WT and 0 . 65 for Delta . 5 . Delayed vaccination using a vaccine with an Oxford / AstraZeneca efficacy profile Vaccine efficacy parameters as in 6 . With a delay in vaccine dose distribution of 2 months ( vaccination from 15th April 2021 ) . For Scenarios 3 and 5 a vaccination programme using a Pfizer / BioNTech or Oxford / AstraZeneca efficacy profile with a delay of two months is considered . Here vaccination would begin 15th April 2021 , aligning with initial deliveries of Oxford / AstraZeneca vaccine doses through COVAX ( 42 ) . For each scenario we ran 500 simulations , drawing parameters from the posterior distribution of each fitted parameter , and calculated the difference in hospital admissions , ICU admissions and deaths from the original model fit to estimate the impact of the scenario considered . We also conducted a counterfactual analysis to examine the trade - off between differing levels of vaccination coverage and changes in population mobility on deaths , hospital admissions and ICU admissions during the time period between 16th February - 16th August 2021 . We considered 11 vaccination coverage scenarios with coverage by 16th August 2021 ranging from 0 to 100 % in 10 % increments , and 9 population mobility scenarios changing ‘Work’ and ‘Other’ mobility by an extra - 40 % to + 40 % compared with the Google mobility data during the simulation period . Vaccination allocation for each scenario was performed in a similar way as described above , where daily vaccinations are multiplied by a factor equal to ! " # $ % & ’ $ ! " # $ % & ’ " ( ) ! " # $ % & ’ $ & + ’ $ & % . Vaccination doses are then distributed between eligible age groups .

We then used the fitted model to simulate epidemic trajectories for 99 scenarios , considering all combinations of vaccination coverage and population mobility change , and estimated the impact of the scenario considered as above . Results COVID - 19 transmission dynamics between 2020 - 2022 Our modelling analysis suggests that , after an initial decline in transmission following a sharp reduction in social interactions , COVID - 19 dynamics were driven by substantial accumulation of immunity throughout 2020 - 2022 ( Figure 4 ) , as well as the spread of novel variants such as Mu in mid - 2021 and Delta in late 2021 . By jointly fitting to reported deaths , hospital bed occupancy , ICU bed occupancy and seroprevalence data , the model reproduced the overall observed epidemic dynamics . Estimated deaths did not track closely with observed deaths during the first wave from March - September 2020 , and deaths and hospitalisations were slightly underestimated during the second wave in January 2021 . .

Panels show comparison between modelled and observed hospital bed occupancy ( A ) , ICU bed occupancy ( B ) , reported deaths ( C ) and proportion of the population previously infected ( D ) . Black lines show observed data , with horizontal dashed lines in panels ( A ) and ( B ) indicating the point at which hospitalisation data became available . For panel ( B ) the black cross shows the duration of the serosurvey ( horizontal line ) and the 95 % confidence interval around the central estimate ( vertical line ) . Modelled hospital bed occupancy , ICU bed occupancy , deaths , and proportion previously infected , are shown in orange , red , purple and green respectively , with associated 50 % and 95 % credible intervals in surrounding ribbons . Note that uncertainty in the observation process is included in modelled outputs for surveillance data streams ( A , B and C ) but not for the proportion previously infected ( D ) . Reconstructing the underlying epidemic dynamics , we found that changes in the effective reproduction number , R t , reflected changes in contact rates derived from Google mobility data during 2020 , but were less strongly associated with contact rates during 2021 ( Figure 5 ) . We estimated that 33 . 3 % ( 95 % CrI : 33 . 3 - 33 . 4 ) of the population had been infected by the end of 2020 ( Figure 5 ) , ranging from around 45 % in those aged 20 - 39 to around 20 % in those aged under 19 and above 70 ( Figure S . 3 ) . This accumulation of population immunity contributed to a decline in transmission , with R t remaining around 1 despite gradual increases in contact rates from May 2020 . By the end of 2021 , we estimated that 83 . 0 % ( 95 % CrI : 82 . 7 - 83 . 2 % ) of the population had been infected , ranging from above 90 % in those aged 20 - 39 to around 55 % .

Again , high levels of post - infection immunity resulted in reduced levels of transmission despite contact rates approaching pre - pandemic baseline levels , except during the emergence of more transmissible variants in May and September 2021 . Figure 5 : Immune status , contact rates and reproduction number estimates from January 2020 to December 2021 . Panel A shows the modelled distribution of immune states in the Dominican Republic over time showing the proportion of the population that are : currently infected ( brown ) , susceptible ( beige ) , protected post - infection ( blue ) and protected post - vaccination ( dark blue ) . Note that the vaccinated area ( dark blue ) does not include individuals that were vaccinated post - infection and so does not correspond with observed vaccination coverage . Panel B shows inferred contact rates in home , work , school and other settings relative to a pre - pandemic baseline . Panel C shows estimated R 0 and R t . The vertical lines on Panel C show the time at which Mu sequences start to increase , according to GISAID , the global data science initiative ( 16 ) . Impact of vaccination campaign To estimate the impact of vaccination , we used our calibrated model to simulate counterfactual epidemic trajectories under different scenarios . First , we considered a ‘no vaccination scenario’ , estimating deaths , hospital and ICU admissions in the absence of any vaccination during 2021 ( Figure 6 ) . By comparing these counterfactual outcomes to the original model estimates we were able to estimate the burden averted by the vaccination campaign in the 6 and 10 months following its launch in February 2021 ( Table 2 ) .

This is a simplifying assumption , as in reality it is possible countries would respond to rising COVID - 19 cases with impositions of further restrictions or would see accompanying changes in population behaviour . We estimated that the vaccination campaign averted 5040 hospital admissions ( 95 % CrI : 4750 - 5350 ) , 1500 ICU admissions ( 95 % CrI : 1420 - 1590 ) and 544 deaths ( 95 % CrI : 488 - 606 ) in the 6 months following its launch . This is equivalent to averting 20 . 3 % ( 95 % CrI : 15 . 9 - 24 . 3 ) of hospital admissions , 24 . 9 % ( 95 % CrI : 20 . 8 - 28 . 7 ) of ICU admissions and 27 . 2 % ( 95 % CrI : 19 . 5 - 34 . 1 ) of reported deaths considering the median values expected under a ‘no vaccination ' scenario . Notably , under a ‘no vaccination scenario’ , we estimated ICU capacity would have been exceeded and hospital bed capacity almost reached , given population behaviour and variant introductions observed in 2021 ( 17 ) .

Figure showing modelled deaths ( A ) , hospital admissions ( B ) and ICU admissions ( C ) from the original model fit ( blue ) and from a ‘no vaccination’ counterfactual ( red ) . Lines show the median value from 500 simulations . To facilitate comparison between scenarios , modelled deaths do not include uncertainty generated through the observation process and are therefore higher than those shown in the model fit in Figure 4 . Given the challenges and inequities of vaccine availability in real - time , with some products available at scale before others , we evaluated the impact of using alternative vaccine products with or without a delay in the vaccination programme on deaths , hospital and ICU admissions . We estimated that while vaccination with a more efficacious product would have reduced hospitalisations , ICU admissions and deaths , delaying the vaccination campaign to vaccinate with a more efficacious product would have resulted in a higher overall burden in subsequent waves in 2021 ( Figure 7 ) .

Trade - off between vaccination and population mobility Finally , we investigated the trade - off between levels of vaccination coverage and population mobility on hospitalisations , ICU admissions and deaths . Here , we explore different counterfactual combinations of vaccination coverage and population mobility change to understand how much relaxation of social distancing measures vaccination could ‘buy’ in the later stages of a pandemic . We found that , overall , changes in population mobility resulted in greater variation in disease burden than vaccination , where an increase in population mobility resulted in more additional deaths , hospitalisation and ICU admissions than a corresponding decrease in vaccination ( Figure 8 ) . For instance , our analysis suggests an increase of 20 % in population mobility would result in around 10 , 800 extra hospital admissions , 2 , 400 extra ICU admissions and 800 extra deaths , while a reduction of 20 % in vaccination coverage would result in around 2 , 000 extra hospital admissions , 600 extra ICU admissions and 200 extra deaths ( Figure 8 ) . We also compared combinations of population mobility reduction and vaccination coverage that resulted in the same outcomes ( looking at lines of equivalence in Figure 8 ) . We found that in the absence of vaccination , an additional 10 - 20 % reduction in population mobility would have been required to obtain the same hospitalisation and death outcomes seen in this period , quantifying the ‘return - to - normality’ associated with the first 6 months of vaccination in this setting . .

This additional burden averted ( going from the observed coverage of 43 % to 100 % ) is lower than the burden averted that we estimated in the earlier ‘no vaccination’ scenario ( going from 0 % coverage to the observed 43 % coverage , Table 2 ) . This illustrates the importance of an age - targeted approach in reducing morbidity and mortality . Finally , a simulated change in mobility of + 30 % would have returned contacts in February 2021 back to ( or slightly above ) pre - pandemic baseline levels . This suggests that a return to baseline mobility at the beginning of the vaccination campaign would have resulted in an extra 5 , 130 hospital admissions ( 95 % CrI : 6 , 080 – 8 , 480 ) , 1 , 670 ICU admissions ( 95 % CrI : 1 , 320 – 2 , 030 ) and 555 deaths ( 95 % CrI : 283 – 842 ) . Figure 8 : Modelled total additional hospital admissions , ICU admissions and deaths in the 6 months following the vaccination campaign launch ( 16th February 2021 - 16th August 2021 ) . These contour plots show additional deaths ( panel A ) , hospital admissions ( panel B ) and ICU admissions ( panel C ) compared to the original model fit under different levels of simulated vaccination coverage reached by 16th August 2021 ( y - axis ) and changes in population mobility during the 6 month period ( x - axis ) . The actual vaccination coverage observed on 16th August 2021 is shown by a cross ( vaccination coverage = 43 % and mobility change = 0 ) . Discussion We used an age - structured transmission dynamic model to quantify the drivers of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in the Dominican Republic and investigated the impact of the vaccination campaign and other counterfactual vaccination scenarios . We found that despite substantial prior accumulation of post - infection immunity , the vaccination campaign had an important impact on disease burden in 2021 and was essential in enabling a return to pre - pandemic mobility levels without incurring substantial additional burden . We estimate the campaign averted 5040 hospital admissions ( 95 % CrI : 4750 - 5350 ) , 1500 ICU admissions ( 95 % CrI : 1420 - 1590 ) and 544 deaths ( 95 % CrI : 488 - 606 ) in the first 6 months of the campaign . From 2020 - 2021 the Dominican Republic experienced four distinct waves of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission . We found that , after the initial emergence of SARS - CoV - 2 in March 2020 , the first wave was largely controlled by the imposition of NPIs and the associated sharp drop in contact rates .

This contrasts with other settings with well - characterised transmission dynamics , such as the United Kingdom , where SARS - CoV - 2 dynamics were largely driven by the imposition of NPIs before the widespread rollout of vaccination ( 19 ) . The second wave from November - February 2021 was driven by a spike in contacts in December 2021 , while the third wave during the summer of 2021 is best explained by gradually increasing contact rates back to pre - pandemic levels alongside the emergence of more transmissible variants , including the Mu variant . Finally , the fourth wave between September and December 2021 was driven by the Delta variant , alongside the reopening of schools and the relaxation of NPIs including curfews . We estimated that the 43 % two - dose coverage achieved by the vaccination campaign by mid - August 2021 would have offset a 10 - 20 % increase in mobility – a proxy for social interactions – in this period , quantifying the ‘return - to - normality’ enabled by the vaccination campaign . Indeed , from July 2021 the Dominican Republic began to reopen the economy , culminating in the removal of curfew measures in October 2021 with population mobility almost returning to pre - pandemic baseline levels . This contrasts with other settings where higher levels of vaccination coverage were required to lift measures , such as the United Kingdom , which relaxed many measures in the summer of 2021 with a two - dose vaccine coverage of around 60 % and population mobility still well below baseline ( 18 , 20 ) . Many other countries were unable to lift measures before intense Omicron transmission generated substantial population immunity or until very high vaccination coverage was achieved ( 21 ) . The trade - off between vaccination and population mobility on disease burden is likely to differ depending on the setting and epidemiological context . For instance , countries with lower levels of post - infection immunity would likely see greater changes in burden associated with changes in vaccination coverage . This balance will also be affected by the emergence of new variants which may be more transmissible or exhibit immune evasive properties . There are several limitations to this analysis . During the first wave ( March - September 2020 ) , the model struggled to reproduce the observed pattern in reported deaths . This may reflect limits in testing infrastructure and COVID - 19 death reporting during this period , as observed in many countries globally ( 22 ) . Hospitalisation and ICU data were only publicly reported from September 2020 , and deaths were probably under - reported early in the pandemic . While we partially accounted for changes in COVID - 19 death reporting by allowing the infection - fatality ratio to vary over time , there remains substantial uncertainty in the modelled size and timing of the first wave . Our modelling framework only incorporates protection from full primary vaccination with two doses and does not incorporate protection from a single dose . This would result in an underestimation of the impact of vaccination . However , as estimated protection of a single dose of Coronavac is low ( particularly against the Delta strain ) , we do not expect this to have an important impact on our results ( 23 ) . Additionally , we assume fully vaccinated individuals are immediately afforded protection according to vaccine efficacy estimates used . We do not consider the impact of booster vaccination , which had begun in the Dominican Republic by late 2021 and we do not consider any additional benefit afforded by vaccination for individuals with post - infection immunity . Due to limited information on the introduction and epidemiological characteristics of variants introduced in early 2021 , we parameterised the model for wild - type and Delta variants and modelled the effect of Mu and other VOC / VOIs in mid 2021 through a fitted sinusoidal increase in transmissibility over this period . We therefore do not capture the effect of .

Assuming increased transmissibility of Mu or other variants , rather than immune evasion , would result in an underestimation of the impact of the vaccination campaign , as fewer individuals would remain susceptible during vaccine roll - out and therefore able to benefit from post - vaccination rather than post - infection protection . Our analysis untangles the complex interactions between population behaviour , the introduction of variants and changes in population immunity in the Dominican Republic , enabling us to estimate the impact of vaccination and consider other counterfactual scenarios . We quantify the impact of these epidemic drivers in a setting with high seroprevalence during vaccination rollout , providing alternative insights to much comparable modelling in high - income countries . Our conclusions are therefore likely to be relevant to many other countries that were unable to suppress transmission through NPIs prior to vaccination roll - out . We also highlight the importance of having multiple data streams available to accurately characterise transmission dynamics during an epidemic and particularly the utility of serological data in estimating population infection history . Similarly , the availability of hospital and ICU occupancy data is crucial for understanding how the relationship between infection , severe outcomes and death modulates during the epidemic due to improved treatment , the introduction of VOC / VOIs , and vaccination . Understanding these dynamics in real - time is essential to avoid potential problems such as reopening the economy too late when the population has high levels of immunity or delaying the re - imposition of NPIs when new variants emerge or contact rates increase unexpectedly . Ensuring that reliable data streams can be set - up quickly across both high income and low - and middle income countries should be a priority for future pandemic planning and preparedness .
