However , molecular mechanisms for the spa - tio - temporal regulation of ﬁlamentous actin ( F - actin ) dynamics by spinous Ca 2 + - transients are still poorly deﬁned . We show that the postsynaptic Ca 2 + sensor caldendrin orchestrates nano - domain actin dy - namics that are essential for actin remodeling in the early phase of long - term potentiation ( LTP ) . Steep elevation in spinous [ Ca 2 + ] i disrupts an intramolecu - lar interaction of caldendrin and allows cortactin binding . The fast on and slow off rate of this interac - tion keeps cortactin in an active conformation , and protects F - actin at the spine base against coﬁlin - induced severing . Caldendrin gene knockout results in higher synaptic actin turnover , altered nanoscale organization of spinous F - actin , defects in structural spine plasticity , LTP , and hippocampus - dependent learning . Collectively , the data indicate that calden - drin - cortactin directly couple [ Ca 2 + ] i to preserve a minimal F - actin pool that is required for actin remod - eling in the early phase of LTP . INTRODUCTION Dendritic spine synapses undergo structural plasticity in an activity - dependent manner . A deeper appreciation of the under - lying mechanisms will ultimately help to understand how infor - mation is stored at the cellular level . F - actin is highly enriched in spines and represents a key substrate for plasticity - related changes in spine morphology ( Bosch et al . , 2014 ; Honkura et al . , 2008 ) . Accordingly , it has been shown that the dynamics of actin polymerization and severing underlie the morphological changes caused by induction of LTP or long - term depression of synaptic transmission ( Bosch and Hayashi , 2012 ; Matsuzaki et al . , 2004 ; Ra´cz and Weinberg , 2013 ) . At hippocampal Schaffer - collateral CA1 synapses , Ca 2 + inﬂux through N - Methyl - D - aspartate receptors ( NMDARs ) is instruc - tive for F - actin dynamics ( Bosch et al . , 2014 ; Kim et al . , 2015 ; Okamoto et al . , 2007 ) . Current evidence suggests that a complex interplay between actin - binding proteins ( ABPs ) and upstream signaling cascades activates or inhibits actin polymerization , branching , and stabilization , in turn underlying the organization of F - actin in spines ( Hotulainen and Hoogenraad , 2010 ; Kim et al . , 2015 ) . Several ABPs exhibit a dynamic association with spinous actin : they dissociate from and re - enter spines that undergo plasticity in a tightly controlled temporal manner ( Bosch et al . , 2014 ) . Upon LTP induction , rapid spine entry of the F - actin severing protein coﬁlin - 1 results in an increased number of barbed ends . F - actin branching ( Arp2 / 3 complex ) or capping ( actin binding protein 1 ) proteins transiently increase , whereas ABPs involved in stabilizing the suprastructure of the actin cyto - skeleton by bundling F - actin or linking F - actin to the postsyn - aptic density ( PSD ) are transiently reduced ( Bosch et al . , 2014 ; Okamoto et al . , 2007 ; Sjo¨blom et al . , 2008 ) . The switch in equilib - rium from actin stabilizers to actin modiﬁers generates a short time window that is triggered by NMDAR Ca 2 + inﬂux , in which the actin cytoskeleton becomes labile and susceptible to major reorganization . Thereafter , the stabilization of newly remodeled actin occurs by a steady increase of actin - stabilizing proteins in potentiated spines . In consequence , however , a stable pool of ABPs must exist for structural remodeling in the initial phase , helping to keep the elementary F - actin network in association 1110 Neuron 97 , 1110 – 1125 , March 7 , 2018 ª 2018 Elsevier Inc . with the PSD ( Bosch et al . , 2014 ; Racz and Weinberg , 2004 ) . Unfortunately , molecular machineries coupling local and rapid synaptic elevation of [ Ca 2 + ] i to actin remodeling in the initial reor - ganization phase are currently unknown ( Bosch et al . , 2014 ; Kim et al . , 2015 ; Okamoto et al . , 2007 ) . In this study , we introduce a mechanism that can directly and instantaneously transduce local Ca 2 + - signals to actin reorgani - zation ensuring stabilization of the potentiated dendritic spines . In a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments , we show that elevations in [ Ca 2 + ] i interrupt an intramolecular interaction in the postsynaptic Ca 2 + sensor caldendrin that masks a series of PxxP motifs . Caldendrin then readily associates with the SH3 domain of the F - actin binding protein cortactin and releases the cortactin SH3 domain from back folding to its own proline - rich domain ( PRD ) . This in turn protects F - actin against coﬁlin - induced severing , presumably at the base of spines , and promotes subsequent activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex via sequential recruitment of N - WASP . Genetic deletion or protein knockdown of caldendrin results in higher synaptic turnover of actin and cortactin , misarrangement of spinous F - actin nano - structure , loss of a stable synaptic F - actin pool , and impaired LTP and object recognition memory . These cellular and behav - ioral phenotypes can be rescued by application of the actin - stabilizing drug jasplaklinoide ( JPK ) or by re - expression of a wild type , but not a Ca 2 + - binding mutant , of caldendrin in a null mutant background . Collectively the data show that Ca 2 + bind - ing to caldendrin following opening of NMDARs stabilizes a pool of F - actin that is required for structural remodeling of spines undergoing plasticity . RESULTS An Uncommon Mechanism for a Ca 2 + - Dependent Target Interaction Allows for Binding of Caldendrin to the SH3 Domain of Cortactin Caldendrin has a unique bipartite structure with a highly basic , proline - and arginine - rich N terminus and a calmodulin ( CaM ) - like , EF - hand - containing C terminus ( Seidenbecher et al . , 1998 ; Figure 1A ) . To learn more about a synaptic role of calden - drin , we reasoned that speciﬁc SH3 - domain - containing binding partners for the N terminus might exist . We therefore probed SH3 domain protein arrays with a bacterially produced N - terminal fragment and found most prominent binding to the SH3 domain of cortactin ( Figure 1B ; Table S1 ) . A caldendrin - speciﬁc antibody allowed the co - immuniprecipitation ( co - IP ) of cortactin from rat brain lysates , indicating that both proteins might be part of one complex in vivo ( Figure 1C ) . Moreover , both proteins co - localize in dendritic spines of rat hippocampal primary neurons , as re - vealed by immunoﬂuorescence staining , and both are also abundantly present in the PSD fraction ( Figures S1A and S1B ) . Heterologous co - IP experiments independently conﬁrmed an interaction of mCherry - cortactin with caldendrin - GFP in HEK293T cell lysates and showed that cortactin associates with the proline - rich N terminus of caldendrin , but not the EF - hand - containing C - terminal part ( Figure 1D ) . Surprisingly , the interaction of full - length cortactin and caldendrin was much stronger in the presence of 0 . 5 mM Ca 2 + than in Ca 2 + - free conditions ( Figure 1E ) . Subsequent GST - pull - down assays conﬁrmed that bacterially expressed GST - cortactin also binds to untagged caldendrin from a HEK293T cell extract more efﬁ - ciently in the presence of Ca 2 + , whereas binding to the separated GFP - tagged N terminus in pull - down assays is not Ca 2 + - sensi - tive ( Figure 1F ) . A direct interaction was also conﬁrmed when we performed the pull - down experiment with deﬁned protein amounts of GST - cortactin and recombinant puriﬁed caldendrin in the presence of 10 m M Ca 2 + , a free Ca 2 + concentration that is readily observed in spine synapses ( Figure 1G ) . To narrow down the N - terminal binding region we then inserted point mutations and found that replacing two arginines at position 40 and 41 to alanine clearly reduced binding of caldendrin to cortactin ( Figure S1C ) . To test further for a direct interaction and to analyze binding kinetics in more detail , we next used surface plasmon resonance ( SPR ) . Immobilized SH3 domain of cortactin was probed for caldendrin interaction in the presence of either 0 . 5 mM Ca 2 + or EGTA ( Figures 1H and 1I ) . We found that caldendrin associates with the SH3 domain more readily in the presence of Ca 2 + ( Figures 1H and 1I ) with an association rate constant ( k a ) of 3 . 4 3 10 4 1 / Ms and a global K D of 0 . 4 m M ( Figure 1J ) . Furthermore , the interaction is very sta - ble with about 70 % binding after 60 min in the presence of Ca 2 + and 50 % in the presence of EGTA , as judged by the dissociation kinetics ( Figure 1H ) . A Ca 2 + - binding mutant of caldendrin in which we replaced two aspartate residues ( D243 and D280 ) in the Ca 2 + - binding EF hands 3 and 4 with alanine ( Figure S1D ) showed much weaker binding afﬁnity and a slower association rate , despite the presence of the PxxP motifs ( K D of 7 . 7 m M and a k a of 1158 1 / Ms ) ( Figure 1K ) . Comparable results were ob - tained with eukaryotically expressed proteins in heterologous co - immunoprecipitation experiments ( Figure S1E ) . Finally , even higher association but comparable dissociation kinetics between full - length caldendrin and cortactin was measured in physiological Ca 2 + concentrations ( 10 m M ) in single - cycle titration mode SPR experiments ( K D of 0 . 42 m M and a k a of 37 . 6 3 10 5 1 / Ms ) ( Figure S1F ) . Thus , Ca 2 + facilitates the associ - ation of caldendrin with the SH3 domain of cortactin and promotes stability of the complex . Caldendrin Is a Fast Ca 2 + Sensor and Ca 2 + Binding Interrupts an Intramolcular Interaction in Caldendrin These data make it likely that the accessibility of the N - terminal binding interface is regulated by a Ca 2 + - dependent intramolecu - lar interaction of caldendrin . Fo¨rster resonance energy transfer acceptor bleaching ( FRET - AB ) experiments performed in living COS - 7 cells ( Figures 2A and 2B ) indeed revealed that YFP - cal - dendrin - CFP exhibited a robust FRET signal , while FRET efﬁciency was signiﬁcantly reduced following bath application of the Ca 2 + ionophore ionomycin ( Figures 2A and 2B ) . In SPR experiments , we observed that the ﬁrst 60 amino acids of the N terminus directly interact with the second EF - hand domain of caldendrin ( Figure 2C ; Table S2 ) . Moreover , binding was much weaker in the presence of Ca 2 + ( Figure 2C ; Table S2 ) . Taken together , these experiments suggest a unique mecha - nism of interaction that will likely not be competed by other EF - hand Ca 2 + - sensors . However , the most closely related Ca 2 + sensor , CaM , binds Ca 2 + at a faster rate than even fast Ca 2 + buffers ( Faas et al . , 2011 ) ; with respect to the abundance of Neuron 97 , 1110 – 1125 , March 7 , 2018 1111 MWkDa 70 - 95 - cortactin mAb B 35 - GFP rAb E 35 - + cald - Ct - GFP GFP rAb D Ca 2 + A caldendrin EF2 EF1 EF4 EF3 1 298 1 132 RRLPGPCPDSPPQAHCR HIAKPSSRR PPARGR caldendrin - Nt I npu t I P : c a l d r b I P : I g G r b MWkDa I npu t : G F P - c o r t 70 - 100 - 55 - 26 - + - + - + - + - + caldendrin I npu t : G F P - c o r t I P : G F P - c o r t I P : G F P - c o r t I npu t : G F P I npu t : G F P I P : G F P I P : G F P caldendrin gpAb F + - + - + caldendrin I npu t P D : G S T - c o r t P D : G S T - c o r t P D : G S T P D : G S T caldendrin gpAb 45 - 45 - + cald - Nt - GFP + + - - I npu t P D : G S T - C o r t P D : G S T P D : G S T - C o r t P D : G S T Ca 2 + MWkDa Ca 2 + MWkDa SH3 domain array I + 6x His - SUMO - cald - Nt anti - histidine - HRP conjugate MWkDa 100 - 55 - I npu t I P : G F P c a l d - G F P c a l d - N t - G F P c a l d - C t - G F P c a l d - G F P c a l d - N t - G F P c a l d - C t - G F P + mCherry - cort + mCherry 55 - 26 - 100 - 55 - 26 - 55 - GFP rAb RFP rAb GFP rAb RFP rAb 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 0 100 200 300 400 0 20 40 60 0 20 40 60 80 100 R e l a t i v e s t ab ili t y , % R e s pon c e , A U Time ( 0 = baseline ) , s Time , min EGTA Ca 2 + H C SPR : cort _ SH3 + cald SH3 1 546 NTA cortactin PRD actin - binding repeats Dissociation kinetics : cort _ SH3 + cald 0 5 10 15 20 0 10 20 30 40 0 5 10 15 0 10 20 30 40 Time , min Time , min R e s pon c e , A U R e s pon c e , A U SPR : cort + cald ( Ca 2 + ) SPR : cort + cald mut ( Ca 2 + ) J K k a = 3 . 4x10 4 1 / Ms K D = 0 . 4 μ M k a = 11581 / Ms K D = 7 . 7 μ M 0 500 1000 0 20 40 60 80 100 SPR : cort _ SH3 + cald R e s pon c e , A U Time , s I Association kinetics EGTA Ca 2 + - - + + P D : G S T - c o r t P D : G S T P D : G S T - c o r t P D : G S T + caldendrin 10 μ MCa 2 + 500 μ MCa 2 + GFP rAb G 35 - Ca 2 + MWkDa Figure 1 .

( legend continued on next page ) 1114 Neuron 97 , 1110 – 1125 , March 7 , 2018 CaM , thesteepandshortCa 2 + transientsinspines , thisfastasso - ciation rate raises the question of whether caldendrin will be able to compete for Ca 2 + binding with CaM , which is a prerequisite for a rapid Ca 2 + - dependent target interaction ( Raghuram et al . , 2012 ) . To address the kinetic properties of Ca 2 + binding to cal - dendrin , we employed an ultrafast in vitro technique that has been previously used for measuring Ca 2 + - binding properties of calbindin - D ( 28k ) and CaM ( Faas et al . , 2011 ; N € agerl et al . , 2000 ) . The rapid increase in Ca 2 + concentration following ﬂash photolysis of Ca 2 + caged with DM - Nitrophen ( DM - N ) can be detected with the fast ﬂuorescent Ca 2 + indicator Oregon Green 488 BAPTA - 5N ( OGB - 5N ) ( Figures 2D andS2A – S2F ) . In thepres - ence of caldendrin , the decay of the ﬂash - induced ﬂuorescence was reduced due to the Ca 2 + binding by the protein and was similar to the kinetics of the Ca 2 + chelator EGTA ( control t decay = 0 . 37 ms , caldendrin t decay = 0 . 24 ms , EGTA t decay = 0 . 17 ms ) ( Figure2D ) . Inadirectcomparison , wefoundthatatphysiological concentrations of caldendrin ( Figures S2G and S2H ) , the Ca 2 + afﬁnity of caldendrin is not distinguishable from those of CaM ( Faaset al . , 2011 ; Figurse S2Eand S2F ) . Giventhat calcium bind - ing kinetics of caldendrin are comparable with CaM , this indi - cates that the protein is able to rapidly sense Ca 2 + transients in the range of 5 – 10 m M like they occur within the ﬁrst milliseconds aftertheinductionNMDAR - dependentLTP ( Sabatinietal . , 2002 ) . Caldendrin Binding Releases the Back - Folding of Cortactin and Promotes Cortactin - Mediated F - Actin Stabilization Cortactin is a multidomain protein containing an N - terminal acidic region ( NTA ) , which binds the Arp2 / 3 complex , actin - bind - ingrepeatsthatare importantforassociationwithF - actin , aPRD , and a C - terminal SH3 domain ( Schnoor et al . , 2018 ; Figure 1A ) . Self - inhibition by intramolecular interactions of the SH3 domain and PRD can be released either by phosphorylation or by competitive ligand binding to the SH3 domain ( Schnoor et al . , 2018 ; Martinez - Quiles et al . , 2004 ) . We found that COS - 7 and HEK293T cells expressing caldendrin showed decreased FRET signals of a YFP - cortactin - CFP reporter measured in living cells and cell extracts , respectively ( Figures 3A , 3B , and S3A ) . To conﬁrm the interaction of active cortactin and caldendrin in vivo , we performed a replating assay with COS - 7 cells double trans - fected with mCherry - cortactin and caldendrin - GFP . Under these conditions , active cortactin accumulates at motile lamelipodia containing branched F - actin , and caldendrin - GFP was enriched in the same locations ( Figure S3B ) . We next asked whether caldendrin binding impacts actin dynamics and ﬁrst immunoprecipitated caldendrin - GFP / mCherry - cortactin from HEK293T cell lysates . We found that endogenous Arp2 is not present in this complex ( Figure 3C ) . Cor - tactin weakly binds and activates the Arp2 / 3 complex on its own , but shows strong synergistic potentiation of actin polymeriza - tion , together with N - WASP , that also interacts with cortactin’s SH3 domain . When we immunoprecipitated endogenous N - WASP from HEK293T cell lysates , we found Arp2 in the precipitate but did not ﬁnd co - expressed untagged caldendrin ( Figure 3D ) . Interestingly , in the presence of 0 . 5 mM Ca 2 + and caldendrin , the band of cortactin in the N - WASP immunoprecip - itate was much stronger ( Figures 3D and 3E ) , suggesting a Ca 2 + - dependent facilitating role of caldendrin for activation of cortac - tin and the subsequent association with the N - WASP - Arp2 / 3 complex . To directly address the functional consequences of the inter - action on actin dynamics , we performed a series of in vitro recon - stitution assays . In vitro actin polymerization assays using recombinant proteins ( Figure S3C ) showed that addition of Arp2 / 3 complex and the VCA domain of WASP promoted in vitro polymerization of pyrene - labeled actin ; this effect was futher enhanced by adding cortactin ( Figures 3F and S3D ) . Of note , under these experimental conditions , the constitutively active VCA domain of WASP was used . This can bind Arp2 / 3 and actin monomers simultaneously and does not require active cortactin . The inclusion of caldendrin resulted in no further enhancement of actin polymerization ( Figure 3F ) . We therefore asked next whether the interaction with calden - drin might promote F - actin stability . In vitro depolymerization assay performed in the presence of coﬁlin revealed an increased amount of soluble actin versus ﬁlaments pelleted by ultracentri - fugation ( Figure 3G ) . Pre - incubation of actin ﬁlaments with puri - ﬁed caldendrin had no effect on coﬁlin - induced severing , but in the presence of both caldendrin and cortactin , coﬁlin severing was strongly reduced ( Figure 3G ) . To discriminate spontaneous depolymerization from coﬁlin effects we employed TIRF micro - scopy . In vitro polymerization of Alexa - Fluor - 568 - conjugated actin occurs spontaneously at certain actin concentrations and reaches an equilibrium of G - and F - actin . We then added in different combinations of recombinant coﬁlin , cortactin , and cal - dendrin and determined the rate of F - actin depolymerization caused by G - actin wash - out and coﬁlin - severing efﬁciency by analyzing cuts in the ﬁlament ( Figures 3H and 3I ) . The data showed a clear reduction of actin depolymerization in the pres - ence of either cortactin or caldendrin - cortactin ( Figure 3I ) . How - ever , the number of cuts per m m of ﬁlament was only signiﬁcantly reduced when both proteins were present ( Figures 3I and S3E ; Movie S1 ) , indicating that the presence of caldendrin promotes F - actin stability by hindering coﬁlin severing . Furthermore , a G / F actin sedimentation assay in HEK293T cells revealed that caldendrin overexpression increased F - actin content to a similar extent as treatment with the actin stabilizer JPK ( Figure 3J ) . ( I ) Kymographs analysis of F - actin depolymerization rate indicates slower depolymerization in the presence of cortactin or caldendrin and cortactin together ( lower left ) .

( legend continued on next page ) 1116 Neuron 97 , 1110 – 1125 , March 7 , 2018 Caldendrin Deﬁciency Results in Simpliﬁcation of Synapto - dendritic Cytoarchitecture Cortactin plays a documented role in spine dynamics and dendrite development ( Hering and Sheng , 2003 ; Chen and Hsueh , 2012 ) . Similar to cortactin , caldendrin overexpression and shRNA knockdown had prominent effects on cell morphology of hippocampal primary neurons ( Figures 4A – 4D , S4A , and S4B ) . Caldendrin overexpression moderately increased the number of spines and the spine length of hippo - campal primary neurons at day in vitro ( DIV ) 19 ( Figures 4A , 4B , and S4A ) . Overexpression of the C - terminal EF - hand - con - taining part had no effect , while transfection of the N - terminal half even resulted in a reduction of spine number ( Figures 4A and 4B ) . In addition , sholl analysis revealed a simpliﬁcation of dendritic architecture when neurons were transfected at DIV9 with caldendrin shRNA ( Figure S4C and S4D ) . At DIV14 , when dendrites and synapses are already formed , caldendrin knock - down still induced a profound loss of spines ( Figures 4C and 4D ) . This phenotype resembled those observed after shRNA knockdown of cortactin ( Hering and Sheng , 2003 ) , and it could be rescued by re - expression of shRNA - resistant caldendrin ( Fig - ures S4E – S4H ) as well as by application of JPK ( Figures 4C , 4D , S4C , and S4D ) . To follow up on this ﬁnding , we next employed mouse hippo - campal primary neurons derived from caldendrin - knockout mice ( Figures S5A – S5C , 4E , and 4F ) . At DIV8 , dendrites of caldendrin (cid:1) / (cid:1) neurons were less complex than those of wild - type neurons ( Figure 4E ) , and the number of synapses at DIV12 was also signiﬁcantly reduced ( Figure 4F ) . This phenotype was milder in brain slices of caldendrin (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice ( Figures 4G – 4H and S5F – S5I ) . Of note , there was no change in cortactin expres - sion in the brain of knockout mice ( Figure S5D ) . Nissl stainings showed no major structural defects in the hippocampus of 12 - week - old caldendrin (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice ( Figure S5E ) . However , a closer inspection of CA1 neurons in hippocampal organotypic slices expressing mRuby2 revealed simpliﬁcation of basal dendrites ( Figures S5F – S5I ) , reduced spine number on apical dendrites , reduced spine size , and increased ﬁlopodia length ( Figures 4G and 4H ) . Caldendrin and Cortactin Are Required for BDNF - Induced Spine Size Potentiation Activity - dependent actin remodeling is tightly controlled by a coordinated action of actin nucleation and severing as well as stabilization of the newly arranged actin cytoskeleton ( Bosch et al . , 2014 ; Noguchi et al . , 2016 ) . To test the role of caldendrin and cortactin on spine dynamics , we generated bicistronic lenti - viral constructs expressing shRNA targeting caldendrin or cor - tactin and doxycyclin - inducible MARCKS - GFP as a membrane marker ( Figures S6A and S6B ) . Virally delivered shRNA against caldendrin or cortactin induced a reduction in dendritic spine density at DIV19 and DIV27 ( Figures S6C – S6E ; Movie S2 ) . We then induced synaptic plasticity by application of brain - derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) ( Iki et al . , 2005 ; Molna´r , 2011 ) . Time - lapse imaging revealed that the ﬂuctuation in total number of dendritic protrusions within 1 hr of BDNF application was clearly enhanced after knockdown of caldendrin or cortactin ( Figures 5A and 5B ; Movie S3 ) . Longer treatment with BDNF ( 2 hr ) resulted in induction of cLTP , as seen by increased surface staining of AMPA receptors ( Figures S5J and S5K ) and in an increase in number of dendritic spines ( Figures 5C and 5D ) . Knockdown of both proteins prevented BDNF - induced spine growth as compared to cells infected with a control construct ( Figures 5C , 5D , and S6F – S6H ) . In particular , the formation of new mushroom - like spines was abolished ( Figure S6H ) . Collec - tively these data indicate that not actin polymerization but F - actin stability is controlled by the caldendrin - cortactin interaction . Enhanced Synaptic Activity Triggers Conformational Change of Caldendrin and Increases the Association with Cortactin in Spines The source of spinous calcium that will induce the open confor - mation in caldendrin is most likely calcium inﬂux through synap - tic NMDAR . We have , therefore , ﬁrst assessed the NMDAR : AMPAR ratio in hippocampal CA1 neurons patched in the whole - cell mode in acute slices and found no difference between both genotypes ( Figures S6I – S6K ) . We have also assessed mEPSC amplitude and frequency and found no difference be - tween wild - type and caldendrin (cid:1) / (cid:1) neurons ( Figures S6J and S6K ) . In the next series of experiments we asked whether caldendrin might associate with cortactin in spine synapses following the induction of plasticity . To this end , we transfected hippocampal primary neurons from caldendrin (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice with a CFP - caldendrin - YFP FRET construct . Cells were kept in silencing conditions ( 1 m M TTX ) and then stimulated with the GABA A antagonist bicuculline , which rapidly enchances endog - enous excitatory synaptic transmission and is used as an effec - tive way to trigger synaptic plastcity in primary cultures ( Fig - ure S5J and S5K ; Karpova et al . , 2013 ) .

Accordingly , we found a higher number of spines with stronger FRET signal between GFP - caldendrin - GFP and mCherry - cortactin under these conditions than in silenced controls ( Figures 6C , 6D , and S6L ) . Thus , enhanced synaptic activity promotes the association of caldendrin and cor - tactin in spines .

For further characteriza - tion , see Figures S5J and S5K and Figure S6 . pocampal primary neurons were co - transfected with GFP - actin and the volume marker mRuby2 , and the ﬂuores - cence of both probes was monitored in individual spines at basal conditions ( Fig - ures S7A – S7C ) . The GFP - actin signal was highly correlated with those of mRuby2 , indicating that GFP - actin can also be used to outline spine morphology ( Figures S7A and S7B ) . We next moni - tored spinous GFP ﬂuorescence over 5 min and found that it was much more variable , as evidenced by a higher stan - dard deviation in caldendrin (cid:1) / (cid:1) neurons already under basal conditions ( Figures 6E , 6F , and S7C ) . The increased spine dynamics in caldendrin (cid:1) / (cid:1) neurons suggest a higher rate of actin polymerization and treadmil - ling , which results in shorter live times of actin ﬁlaments . F - actin in spines can be divided into a dynamic pool , with a turnover time below 1 min , and a stable F - actin pool , with a time constant of about 17 min ( Koskinen and Hotulainen , 2014 ) . About 81 % of all spinous actin is in the ﬁlamentous form , of which most is pre - sent in a dynamic state and only 5 % – 15 % is in a stable form ( Honkura et al . , 2008 ; Star et al . , 2002 ) . In support of the notion that the absence of caldendrin will increase spinous F - actin dynamics ﬂuorescence , recovery was higher in caldendrin (cid:1) / (cid:1) neurons ; this suggests a strong reduction in the size of the stable F - actin pool ( mobile fraction : 68 . 2 % ± 4 . 5 % SEM and 93 . 5 % ± 5 % SEM after 1 min in + / + and (cid:1) / (cid:1) neurons , respectively ) ( Figures 6G and 6H ) . Enhanced synaptic activity following blockage of GABA A receptors with bicuculline increased the GFP - actin re - covery rate in wild - type neurons but had no further effect in 1118 Neuron 97 , 1110 – 1125 , March 7 , 2018 1 μ m 0 60 120 180 240 , s 1 μ m Time : cald + / + Time : - 30 0 30 60 120 , s cald - / - E Basal : GFP - actin FRAP : GFP - actin 0 50 100 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 cald - / - ( n = 33 ) cald + / + ( n = 46 ) time , s 0 50 100 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 FRAP : cort - GFP cald + / + ( n = 21 ) cald - / - ( n = 17 ) time , s 1 μ m 1 μ m cald + / + cald - / - 0 50 100 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 cald + / + ( n = 17 ) cald - / - ( n = 23 ) FRAP : GFP - CaMKII β time , s L M H G cald + / + bic . cald - / - bic . 1 μ m 1 μ m 1 μ m 1 μ m cald - / - cald wt cald - / - cald mut 0 50 100 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 time , s cald + / + bicuculline ( n = 41 ) cald + / + basal ( n = 40 ) cald - / - basal ( n = 25 ) cald - / - bicuculline ( n = 26 ) cald + / + ( n = 40 ) cald - / - ( n = 25 ) cald - / - , Ca 2 + , cald - wt ( n = 43 ) cald - / - , Ca 2 + , cald - mut ( n = 35 ) 0 50 100 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 time , s 0 50 100 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 time , s cald + / + basal ( n = 40 ) cald - / - basal ( n = 25 ) cald - / - + cald - wt basal ( n = 41 ) I J K cald - / - 0 100 200 300 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 time , s cald + / + S D o f s p i ne f l uo r e sc en c e # * * * * § § § # * * § § § § § § 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 * * * 0 2 4 6 8 10 TTX ( n = 36 ) bicuculline ( n = 40 ) FRET efficiency 0 . 00 0 . 04 0 . 08 0 . 12 0 . 16 0 . 20 0 . 24 0 . 28 YFP CFP TTX p r e - b l ea c h po s t - b l ea c h YFP CFP bicuculline cald - / - : CFP - cald - YFP A F R E T e ff i c i en cy TTX bicuculline C oun t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 * * * n . s . n . s . mCherry - GFP mCherry + GFP GFP - cald - GFP + mCherry - cort F R E T e ff i c i en c y 0 10 20 30 FRET efficiency TTX ( n = 67 ) bicuculline ( n = 62 ) C oun t 0 . 00 0 . 04 0 . 08 0 . 12 0 . 16 0 . 20 0 . 24 FRET efficincy : GFP - cald - GPF + mCherry - cort mCherry GFP TTX mCherry GFP bicuculline GFP - cald - GFP + mCherry - cort p r e - b l ea c h po s t - b l ea c h FRET efficiency : CFP - cald - YFP p r e - b l ea c h po s t - b l ea c h p r e - b l ea c h po s t - b l ea c h C B D F 0 100 200 300 0 1 2 3 4 0 1 2 3 4 cald + / + ( n = 66 ) cald - / - ( n = 75 ) time , s 0 100 200 300 time , s N o r m a li z ed f l uo r e sc en c e N o r m a li z ed f l uo r e sc en c e N o r m a li z ed f l uo r e sc en c e N o r m a li z ed f l uo r e sc en c e N o r m a li z ed f l uo r e sc en c e N o r m a li z ed f l uo r e sc en c e N o r m a li z ed f l uo r e sc en c e N o r m a li z ed f l uo r e sc en c e Figure 6 .

Most important , re - expression of wild - type caldendrin in caldendrin (cid:1) / (cid:1) neurons did not rescue the FRAP kinetics under resting conditions ( Figures 6G and 6J ; Table S3 ) . A rescue was only seen when excitatory synaptic activity was enhanced with biccuculline prior to FRAP ( Figures 6G and 6K ; Table S3 ) . These results suggest that synap - tic caldendrin needs to ﬁrst be loaded with Ca 2 + to stabilize synaptic F - actin . Accordingly , the calcium - binding mutant of caldendrin could not rescue the FRAP phenotype even when synaptic activity was enhanced , indicating that Ca 2 + binding is key for regulation of spinous actin dynamics ( Figures 6G and 6K ) . Moreover , knockout neurons transfected with cortactin - GFP exhibited faster recovery after photobleaching than their wild - type counterparts , suggesting a weaker association of cortactin with the F - actin cytoskeleton in the absence of calden - drin ( Figure 6L ) . In control experiments , FRAP of the unrelated F - actin binding protein , CaMKII b fused to GFP , was not altered in knockout neurons ( Figure 6M ) . In conclusion , a stable synaptic pool of F - actin and cortactin is not detectable by FRAP in caldendrin (cid:1) / (cid:1) neurons . The association of cortactin with dendritic spines is reportedly dynamic ( Chen and Hsueh , 2012 ; Hering and Sheng , 2003 ; Iki et al . , 2005 ; Seese et al . , 2012 ) . We indeed found that in rat and mouse hippocampal primary neurons , bicuculline stimula - tion resulted in a transient reduction of cortactin immunoﬂuores - cence at synaptic puncta within 5 min ( Figures S7D – S7G ) . Hippocampal cultures prepared from caldendrin (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice exhibited a stronger reduction of synaptic cortactin immunoﬂuo - rescence ( Figures S7F and S7G ) , further suggesting that cortac - tin has a weaker association with spinous F - actin in the absence of caldendrin . F - actin and ABPs are not uniformly distributed in the spine head but instead show speciﬁc enrichments in spinous nano - compartments ( Chazeau et al . , 2014 ; Racz and Weinberg , 2004 , 2006 ) . The major fraction of cortactin is associated with the spine core , where the stable pool of F - actin is localized ( Racz and Weinberg , 2004 ) . To address the question of how the nanostructure of the actin cytoskeleton is organized in caldendrin (cid:1) / (cid:1) neurons , we employed stimulated emission depletion ( STED ) nanoscopy of F - actin labeled with phalloidin - Atto647N . STED imaging revealed no genotype - dependent dif - ferences in organization of the cortical periodic F - actin lattice in axons , dendrites , and spine necks ( Figure 7A ) . Actin ﬁlaments in mushroom - like spines of wild - type mice are frequently ar - ranged in a cup - like shape outlining the membrane of the spine head ( Figure 7B ) . In contrast , in neurons from caldendrin (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice , the ﬁlaments randomly ﬁlled the spine head ( Figure 7B ) . The normalized phalloidin - Atto647N ﬂuorescence intensity along the axis from the PSD to the spine neck was peaking near the base of the spine in wild - type neurons ; it was more uniformly distributed over the spine head in caldendrin (cid:1) / (cid:1) neurons ( Figures 7B and 7C ) , where F - actin peak intensity shifts toward the center of the spine ( Figures 7D – 7F ) . Thus , the lack of caldendrin induces a major topographical misarrangement in the nanoscale organization of the synaptic F - actin cytoskeleton ( Fig - ures 7B – 7F ) . Along these lines , induction of structural LTP at individual spines in organotypic hippocampal slices with two - photon glutamate uncaging ( Matsuzaki et al . , 2004 ) results in a rapid increase in spine volume in both genotypes ( Figures 7G and 7H ) . However , spine potentiation caused statistically signif - icant large ﬂuctuations in spine size only in caldendrin (cid:1) / (cid:1) neu - rons within the ﬁrst 20 min ( Figures 7G and 7I ) . These ﬂuctuations were caused by repetitive expansion and shrinkage of the spine head , indicating aberrant F - actin remodeling during the early reorganization phase of structural spine plasticity ( Figures 7H and 7I ) . Moreover , these differences cannot be explained by different calcium handling in both genotypes . When we per - formed calcium imaging in acute hippocampal slices , we found that following the induction of dendritic back - propagating action potentials spinous free [ Ca 2 + i ] was not different in wild - type compared to knockout neurons ( Figures S7H and S7I ) . Deﬁcits in LTP and Object Recognition Memory in Caldendrin – / – Mice Can Be Rescued by F - actin Stabilization with JPK The experiments above indicate that the synaptic phenotype in caldendrin - knockout mice is related to reduced F - actin stability , increased actin turnover , and misarrangement of sub - spinous F - actin nanodomains . Next , to test the physiological properties of such synapses , we performed a series of experiments in acute ( C ) FRET AB in individual spines of hippocampal primary cultures ( DIV14 - 17 ) transfected with indicated constructs upon silencing with TTX and stimulation with bicuculline .

( G ) Model depicting the role of caldendrin and cortactin during the initial phase of synaptic potentiation . Ca 2 + increase upon synaptic stimulation is rapidly in - tercepted by caldendrin , which then can bind and activate cortactin via a conformational change . This complex exists over extended periods of time and can bridge the initial calcium inﬂux with the later changes in molecular composition of the spine , resulting in stabilization of synapses . Active and caldendrin - bound cortactin is anchored to F - actin during the fast reorganization of synaptic molecules characteristic for early LTP . I : synaptic coﬁlin increase following NMDAR activation . Coﬁlin severs F - actin , thus allowing generation of new ﬁlaments and reorganization of the spine . II : At the same time , inactive cortactin leaves the spine . A minimal number of actin ﬁlaments are protected from severing by caldendrin - cortactin complex . Cald (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice show much higher F - actin turnover and lossofsynapticcortactinuponstimulation . Severalminutesaftertheinitialpotentiationphase , F - actinbranchesarestabilizedbycaldendrin - cortactincomplex . In addition , caldendrin could dissociate from cortactin in the vicinity of the PSD and allow binding of the Arp2 / 3 complex via N - WASP , allowing further Arp2 / 3 - dependent polymerization ( III ) . 1122 Neuron 97 , 1110 – 1125 , March 7 , 2018 of a stable F - actin pool in the intial reorganization phase of LTP , it is not surprising that Schaffer collateral late LTP ( > 120 min following tetanization ) was almost absent in slices from knockout mice , while the induction of LTP was identical in both genotypes ( Figures 8C and 8D ) . Interestingly , bath perfusion of JPK at con - centrations that had no effect on the induction and maintenance of LTP in hippocampal slices from wild - type mice clearly attenu - ated the impairment in late LTP in slices from knockout mice ( Figure 8E ) . Object recognition memory is sensitive to interruption of NMDAR - dependent LTP at hippocampal CA1 synapses ( Clarke et al . , 2010 ) . We indeed found correspondence to the LTP phenotype impairments in object recognition in caldendrin (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice ( Figure 8F ) . In control experiments , open - ﬁeld and anxi - ety - related behavior in the elevated plus maze was normal , pointing to a cognitive deﬁcit ( Figure S8D ) . This deﬁcit could be partially rescued by intrahippocampal infusion of JPK into the dorsal CA1 at a concentration that negatively impacts mem - ory formation in wild - type mice ( Figures 8F and S8B ) . Thus , sta - bilizing F - actin is even beneﬁcial at the behavioral level , and it improves cognition , which underscores that a major spine func - tion of caldendrin is indeed related to actin remodeling . DISCUSSION In this study , we report with a series of in vitro and in vivo ex - periments an unexpected role of a neuronal Ca 2 + - binding protein in stabilization of actin ﬁlaments . We show that calden - drin is a fast Ca 2 + sensor , able to compete with CaM by synap - tic abundance and ‘‘on’’ rate of Ca 2 + ﬁlling . Ca 2 + binding results in unfolding of caldendrin , exposure of an N - terminal proline - rich region , and rapid association with the SH3 - domain of cor - tactin . In molecular terms , caldendrin binding keeps cortactin in an active , open conformation , which promotes a sustained association with F - actin and speciﬁcally prevents coﬁlin - medi - ated ﬁlament severing ( Figure 8G ) . Most likely , caldendrin - cortactin decorate the F - actin ﬁlaments and provide steric hindrance against coﬁlin - induced severing . Moreover , the pre - vailing association of cortactin with branch points of actin ﬁlaments ( Helgeson and Nolen , 2013 ) suggests that calden - drin - cortactin will protect a minimal pool of branched actin . In mature spines of hippocampal neurons , coﬁlin avoids the spine core and instead concentrates in the spine head periphery and within the postsynaptic density ( Racz and Weinberg , 2006 ) . Translated into a cellular context , the data therefore suggest a scenario in which spinous Ca 2 + transients target calden - drin - cortactin to F - actin located in two spatially segregated sub - compartments . Following the initial phase of Ca 2 + inﬂux , a long - lasting association of caldendrin and cortactin protects a stable pool of actin ﬁlaments , aligning the spine head mem - brane near the base of the spine . Indeed , immunogold labeling combined with electron microscopy demonstrated that cortac - tin concentrates within the spine base , and only a small fraction is adjacent to the PSD ( Racz and Weinberg , 2004 ) . We propose that , near the PSD , a more transient interaction—where caldendrin is subsequently replaced by membrane - bound N - WASP—might occur and will allow for facilitated actin poly - merization . This model is supported by the fact that branched F - actin nucleation machineries like Arp2 / 3 complexes surround the PSD ( Chazeau et al . , 2014 ) . The initial spatio - temporal control of F - actin dynamics by caldendrin - cortactin is essential for the stabilization of LTP . Our data suggest that activity - dependent remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton requires , in the early phase , a minimal re - maining cytoskeletal structure . Relatively little is known about the initial phase of F - actin remodeling in response to elevated [ Ca 2 + ] i following NMDAR stimulation . Although numerous signaling pathways downstream of NMDAR - activation have been identiﬁed ( Okamoto et al . , 2009 ) , the molecular mecha - nisms controlling actual remodeling of the spine are still largely elusive . Previous work suggests that coﬁlin shows a rapid accumulation in spines undergoing early LTP ( Bosch et al . , 2014 ) . Severing of F - actin is essential for generation of barbed ends , which serve as F - actin nucleation points . Subsequent spine entry of other ABPs increases stability of newly formed ﬁlaments and eventually leads to reorganization of the PSD ( Bosch et al . , 2014 ; Chazeau et al . , 2014 ) . Caldendrin retains cortactin in an open conformation and promotes F - actin stabil - ity and subsequent polymerization ( Figure 8G ) , and the fast Ca 2 + - dependent association rate of the caldendrin - cortactin complex places the protein in a central position to bridge early with late - phase LTP . Taken together , the data show a direct mechanistic link between initial Ca 2 + - induced actin re - organi - zation in dendritic spines and long - term effects on spine poten - tiation and stability . Along these lines , we found deﬁcits in object recognition mem - ory in caldendrin (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice that we could , at least in part , rescue by infusion of JPK into the dorsal CA1 region of the hippocampus at a concentration that has detrimental effects in wild - type mice . This result most likely reﬂects differences in spinous F - actin sta - bility in wild - type and knockout mice . In wild - type mice , JPK will induce a shift toward highly stable F - actin , which is detrimental for actin - dependent reorganization of the PSD , potentially by reduced de novo F - actin branching following the induction of LTP . In knockout mice , however , JPK will promote a minimal stable pool of F - actin that is important for subsequent reorgani - zation of the spine cytoskeleton . It is quite striking that caldendrin plays a role in this very early step of F - actin remodeling ( Figure 8G ) , which is in several as - pects opposite to the role recently decribed for CaMKII b ( Kim et al . , 2015 ; Okamoto et al . , 2009 ) . Inactive CaMKII b binds to actin ﬁlaments and inhibits the interaction of other ABPs with F - actin . Activation by Ca 2 + - CaM and subsequent autophosphor - ylation of the F - actin binding domain then interrupts F - actin binding and allows for the association with proteins involved in actin remodeling . Caldendrin - cortactin is probably part of a counteracting system that , by sensing the same Ca 2 + signal , will stabilize F - actin . It is tempting to speculate that in both cases the directionality and kinetics of the spinous Ca 2 + transient will have impact on the F - actin structures that are stabilized or depolymerized . Finally , exposure of a proline - rich binding interface in response to EF - hand Ca 2 + binding is an uncommon mechanism for a Ca 2 + - regulated target interaction that is probably unique to caldendrin ( Figures 1A and 8G ) . Thus , it is likely that cortactin activation is a caldendrin - speciﬁc and CaM - independent Neuron 97 , 1110 – 1125 , March 7 , 2018 1123 function , and probably no other neuronal EF - hand calcium sensor will be able compensate for this role . A lack of compen - sation can explain the strong F - actin - related structural and functional phenotypes in spines following caldendrin protein knockdown and gene knockout , which are unexpected for an EF - hand CaM - like Ca 2 + - sensor protein .

The animals used in this study were bred and main - tained in the animal facility of the Leibniz Institute for Neurobiology , Magdeburg , Germany or ZMNH , Hamburg , Germany . Animals were housed in individually ventilated cages ( Green line system , Tecniplast ) in groups of up to 5 animals with free access to food and water under controlled environmental conditions ( 22 ± 2 (cid:3) C , 55 % ± 10 % humidity , 12 h , light – dark cycle , with lights on at 06 : 00 a . m . ) . Sex as well as the age / developmental stage of experimental animals are indicated in the Method Details ( Neuronal culture , trans - fections and lentiviruses ; Organotypic hippocampal slice cultures ; Electrophysiology in acute hippocampal slices ; Behavior ) . Generation of caldendrin - knockout mice Caldendrin knockout mice were obtained from the Texas A & M Institute for Genomic Medicine ( Houston , USA ) . Knockout mice were generated using the OmniBank ES cell clone OST258109 derived from the 129SvEv strain . Gene - trap insertion in this clone was map - ped to mouse chromosome 5 , 448 bp downstream of exon 2 of the Caldendrin / CaBP1 gene . Mice used for experiments were back - crossed for at least 10 generations to C57BL / 6J and derived from heterozygous breedings . Veriﬁcation of genotypes was done using the following primers : Cald _ wt _ F : GGGGAGGGTGATCCGATGTCTC , Cald _ wt _ R : GGATTTTCCTGTCTCTGACTCCTCA , LTR2 _ mut - F : ATGGCGTTACTTAAGCTAGCTTGC . Expression of caldendrin and its short isoforms was tested by RT - PCR . RNA was extracted from mouse hippocampus and retina using a rotating tissue homogenizer and the RNeasy Mini Kit ( QIAGEN GmbH , Hilden , Germany ) following the manufacturer’s instructions . Reverse transcription was performed with Omniscript ( QIAGEN ) using Oligo ( dT ) primers for 1 h at 37 (cid:3) C . Caldendrin and CaBP1 cDNAs were ampliﬁed in two PCRs using nested primers in the second . In detail the following primers were used : 1 . PCR , for Caldendrin CALD _ ex1 _ 5UTR 5‘CAGCGCGTCCTCGGGCTTG ; for CaBP1 CaBP1 _ ex1A _ 5UTR GCCTCCTTCATGGACCCAGAGAC and a common reverse primer CaBP1 _ ex7 _ 3UTR CTGTGGGAGTTGGCAGACCTG ( 25 cycles ; 95 (cid:3) C for 45 s ; 59 (cid:3) C for 45 s , 72 (cid:3) C for 90 s ) ; 2 .

Constructs shRNA resistant mutants of caldendrin were created by replacement of TCCTGGCGGAGACAGCAGATA by TATTAGCAGAAACG GCCGAAA via creation of PCR fragments overlapping in the particular region with subsequent cold fusion into the linearized pRNAt vector . pAAV - hSyn1 - mRuby2 created by excision of GCaMP6f from pAAV - hSyn1 - mRuby2 - GSG - P2A - GCaMP6f - WPRE - pA ( Addgene plasmid # 50943 ) was a gift from Simon Wiegert . Lentivirus was based on the pSIN - TRE - mSEAP - hPGK - rtTA2sM2 vector ( Didier Trono , EPFL ) . The hPGK promoter was replaced by the 0 . 5kb synapsin promoter and mSEAP was exchanged for MARCKS - GFP . Constitutive shRNA knock down is archieved by e5 Neuron 97 , 1110 – 1125 . e1 – e14 , March 7 , 2018 subcloning the H1 promoter and shRNA sequence from the original pSuper constructs behind the WPRE region ( Figure S6A ) . The following shRNAs sequences were inserted : scrambled GGTTTATATCGCGGTTATT , Cortactin GCACTGCTCACAAGTGGAC ( Hering and Sheng , 2003 ) and Caldendrin # 5 . Biochemistry Brain lysates , subcellular fractionation and WB Freshly dissected tissue from adult cald + / + and (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice or Wistar rats was shortly rinsed in phosphate buffer saline ( PBS ) and then snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at (cid:1) 80 (cid:3) C . Homogenization was done in buffer containing 10 mM Tris / HCl pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 and complete protease inhibitor cocktail ( PI , Roche Diagnostics ) using a hand homogenizer in a ratio of 10 ml / g wet weight . Tissue homogenates were then mixed with 4x SDS sample buffer ( 250 mM Tris pH 8 . 5 , 8 % SDS , 40 % glycerol , 2 mM EDTA , 0 . 01 % bromphenol blue , 100 mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) ) in a ratio of 2 : 1 , boiled for 10 min and centrifuged at 17000 x g for 5 min . Total protein concentration of supernatants was determined by amido black protein assay and equal amounts of tissue extracts ( 15 or 20 m g per lane ) were loaded for SDS - PAGE on 4 % – 12 % gradient gels and blotted onto nitrocellulose or PVDF membranes . After blocking in 5 % skim milk in Tris - buffered saline / Tween ( TBS - T , 20 mM Tris , 150 mM NaCl , pH 7 . 4 , 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 ) or 5 % BSA in TBS - T membranes were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in TBS - A ( TBS + 0 . 02 % NaN 3 pH 7 . 4 ) overnight at 4 (cid:3) C . Corresponding HRP - conjugated secondary antibody were applied for 1 - 1 . 5 h at room temperature ( RT ) . For quan - tiﬁcation of caldendrin protein amount in brain puriﬁed full - length caldendrin ( untagged ) in different amount was used as quantiﬁca - tion standards . Proteins were detected using rabbit anti - caldendrin antibody . Quantiﬁcation of proteins was performed using the ImageJ implemented gel analyzer ( NIH ) . Subcellular fractionation of rat cortex and hippocampus was performed as described earlier ( Karpova et al . , 2013 ) . Protein concentration was measured by amido black assay and 20 m g of each fraction were loaded per lane . PSD - 95 was used as positive control for preparation . Protein puriﬁcation from E . coli Expression and puriﬁcation of GST - tagged cortactin - full - length and SH3 domain was generally performed as ( Reddy et al . , 2014 ) . Brieﬂy , GST - tagged constructs were expressed in E . coli BL21 ( DE3 ) . After 6 h of induction with 0 . 5 mM isopropyl - beta - D - thiogalac - toside at 37 (cid:3) C cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 6 . 000 x g for 15 min and puriﬁed from the soluble fraction by glutathione - Sepharose chromatography . Untagged wild - type and calcium binding mutant of caldendrin and the shorter fragments of the wild - type protein were produced using the intein system as described previously ( Reddy et al . , 2014 ) , 6xHis - SUMO - tagged calden - drin N terminus was puriﬁed as described previously for other 6xHis - SUMO - tagged caldendrin constructs ( Gorny et al . , 2012 ) . Depending on degree of purity recombinant proteins were passed through a superdex 75 gel ﬁltration column using an A¨KTA FPLC system ( A¨KTA puriﬁer , GE Healthcare ) . For protein conformational analysis and proper folding , 8 - Anilinonaphthalene - 1 - sulfonate ﬂuorescence spectroscopy was performed as described previously ( Reddy et al . , 2014 ) . Puriﬁed caldendrin was decalciﬁed using 100 m M EDTA followed by buffer exchange to Chelex - 100 ( BioRad ) treated with 50 mM Tris , 100 mM KCl , pH 7 . 4 . 0 . 5 mM MgCl 2 was added to the EDTA treated protein solution and further buffer exchange was done to remove unbound Mg 2 + , and subsequently lyophylized using a FreeZone freeze dry system ( Labconco ) . Lyophilized protein was reconstituted in Chelex - 100 treated deionized water . SH3 - domain array TranSignal SH3 domain array I of human GST - SH3 domain fusion proteins spotted in duplicate was purchased from Panomics Inc . 6xHis - SUMO - cald - Nt was puriﬁed from E . coli as described above and 1 . 5 m g / ml of the recombinant protein were used for binding . The assay was performed according to manufacturer’s instructions . Shortly , the SH3 array membrane was blocked in 5 % non - fat milk and incubated with puriﬁed 6xHis - SUMO - cald - Nt 4 (cid:3) C over night , washed and incubated with anti - histidine HRP conjugate for 1 - 2 h at RT . Signal was detected after additional washing steps using provided detection buffer and exposure to hyperﬁlm . GST pull - down assays Sepharose - bound GST - cortactin or GST was used for pull - down assays . Caldendrin constructs were heterologously expressed in HEK293T cells . Sepharose beads were washed with the corresponding Ca 2 + buffer ( 2 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM MgCl 2 in TBS , pH 7 . 4 ) or a Ca 2 + free buffer ( 2 mM EGTA , 1 mM MgCl 2 , in TBS , pH 7 . 4 ) and pre - incubated with 5 % bovine serum albumin at 4 (cid:3) C for 30 min to reduce non - speciﬁc binding . Then the beads were washed and incubated for 4 h at 4 (cid:3) C with cell extracts prepared in respective buffer . After extensive washing with corresponding buffers protein samples were eluted with 2x SDS sample buffer and proceeded for immunoblotting . For the pull down using two puriﬁed proteins , GST tagged cortactin and GST alone was immobilized on GST beads and incubated with equimolar caldendrin at 4 (cid:3) C for 3 hr in presence of 10 m M Ca 2 + / EGTA . Samples were washed with cold buffer 50 mM Tris ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 1 % Tween 20 , 1 mM DTT containing either 10 m M Ca 2 + or 10 m M EGTA . Proteins were eluted using 2X SDS - PAGE loading buffer , SDS - PAGE gel was run and blot was developed using caldendrin antibody . Heterologous co - immunoprecipitations For co - immunoprecipitation experiments different combinations of mCherry - cortactin , GFP - cortactin and untagged caldendrin or GFP tagged truncated constructs of caldendrin and corresponding GFP and mCherry controls , were heterologously expressed in COS - 7 cells . Cells were harvested and proteins were extracted with Triton X - 100 containing TBS buffer [ 1 % ( v / v ) Triton X - 100 , 20 mM Tris , 150 mM NaCl and 2 mM DTT , pH 7 . 4 ] 48 h after transfection . Cell extracts were obtained by centrifucation at 12000 x g for 30 min at 4 (cid:3) C and incubated for 1 h at 4 (cid:3) C with anti - GFP antibodies coated on magnetic beads ( Miltenyi Biotec ) in Ca 2 + - buffer [ 2 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 % ( v / v ) Triton X - 100 , 20 mM Tris , 150 mM NaCl and 2 mM DTT , pH 7 . 4 ] or EGTA - buffer Neuron 97 , 1110 – 1125 . e1 – e14 , March 7 , 2018 e6 [ 2 mM EGTA , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 % ( v / v ) Triton X - 100 , 20 mM Tris , 150 mM NaCl and 2 mM DTT , pH 7 . 4 ] . Magnetic beads were exten - sively washed and protein complexes were eluted according to the manufacturer’s protocol ( Miltenyi Biotec ) . The immunoprecipi - tation of proteins was checked with anti - caldendrin , anti - RFP and anti - GFP antibodies . For immunoprecipitation of endogenous N - WASP complex , HEK293 cells were transfected with GFP - cortactin or GFP with or without caldendrin in pcDNA3 . 1 for 24 h , then cells were harvested and lysed in a buffer containing 0 . 5 % ( v / v ) Triton X - 100 , 20 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 150 mM NaCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 and protease inhibitor cocktail . Mixture of Protein A and Protein G magnetic beads ( Biorad ) were incubated with anti - rabbit N - WASP antibody ( Santa Cruz ) in the presence of 0 . 2 % of chicken egg white for 2 h , then washed with the extraction buffer and added to the cell extracts supplemented either with 2 mM EGTA or 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 . After over - night incubation at 4 (cid:3) C beads were extensively washed and eluted using 2x SDS sample buffer . The interaction of cortactin with caldendrin calcium binding mutant was investigated by immunoprecipitation with GFP - trap _ MA ( Chromotek ) . GFP - Cortactin or GFP were co - expressed with wild - type caldendrin or calcium binding mutant in HEK293 cells for 24h . Cells were harvested and lysed as described above . GFP - trap _ MA beads magnetic beads were blocked with 0 . 2 % of chicken egg white in TBS for 30 min at RT . Cell extracts supplemented with 2 mM EGTA or 0 . 5 mM CaCl 2 were added and incubated at 4 (cid:3) C ON . After extensive washing beads were eluted using 2x SDS sample buffer . Biophysics UV ﬂash photolysis To analyze the dynamics of Ca 2 + binding to Mg 2 + - bound caldendrin we used UV uncaging of DM - Nitrophen . The experimental setup was constructed at ‘‘Beam - M’’ research facility , BMSTU and described in detail earlier ( Loktionov et al . , 2016 ) . Flash - photolysis of Ca 2 + - loaded DM - Nitrophen ( Millipore ) was induced by frequency tripled ( 355 nm ) nanosecond ( 7 ns ) Nd : YAG laser ( Solar LS LQ - 115 ) . Photoluminescense was excited by 5 ms ( or longer ) pulses of 473 nm DPSS laser ( Lasever LSR473 ) , starting 1 ms earlier than photolysis ( BNC 575 pulse generator was used for synchronization ) . Oregon Green 488 BAPTA - 5N ( OGB - 5N ; Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) ﬂuorescence was band ﬁltered ( using Thorlabs FEL0500 , FES0550 , FES0600 ) to get a pure 525 ± 25 nm band , and recorded using PMT ( Hamamatsu H6420 ) coupled with a digital oscilloscope ( Tektronix DPO7254 ) . To cut off 355 nm signal , we used a 100 kHz short pass signal ﬁlter ( Thorlabs EF502 ) in addition to optical ones . Ca 2 + uncaging was performed in 5 m L droplets of solutions placed on a sample glass . Photoluminescence exitation radiation ( 473 nm ) was transported using a light source leg of a probe bundle ( Thorlabs RP28 ) coupled with achromatic adaptor ( Solar LS FA - 2 ) , and induced radiation was collected by peripherial ﬁbers . Achromatic condenser ( Solar LS PS - 2 ) on a 3D - mount was used for focusing to get maximum of photoluminescence signal . The spectrometer leg was used to supply that signal to PMT after passing through the above mentioned edge ﬁlters and coupling with another round - to - linear bundle ( Thorlabs BFL105HS02 ) . Thorlabs cage system elements and achromatic ﬁber adapters were used in this construction . The composition of experimental groups is given in Table S3 . Calmodulin was purchased from Sigma , caldendrin was expressed and puriﬁed from E . coli as described above . All reagents were freshly dissolved directly before the measurements . Kinetic parameters of calcium binding to caldendrin or EGTA ( t decay ) were analyzed as described in ( N € agerl et al . , 2000 ) . Isothermal titration calorimetery Isothermal titration calorimetery ( ITC ) was performed using a Microcal VP - ITC calorimeter to check the Ca 2 + binding to caldendrin and the calcium binding mutant at 25 (cid:3) C in chelex treated 50 mM Tris buffer ( pH 7 . 4 ) containing 100 mM NaCl . 35 m M Mg 2 + - bound protein was titrated against 10 mM CaCl 2 prepared in same buffer . Experiments consist of injections 5 m l of Ca 2 + each separated by 3 min of equilibration period . Only buffer and Ca 2 + titration were also performed to measure heat of dilution and subtracted from protein samples . Heat change i . e . , binding enthalpy was calculated by integrating the area under peaks and for the time course of power change and further other thermodynamic parameters was derived from that and ﬁtted with different binding models provided by inbuilt origin software . Surface plasmon resonance analysis Binding and protein complex stability studies for the untagged full - length caldendrin or calcium binding mutant of caldendrin and GST - cortactin were carried out on a sensor chip CM5 using the Biacore X - 100 instrument ( Biacore AB , GE Healthcare , Uppsala , Sweden ) at 25 (cid:3) C according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Brieﬂy , after equilibrating the sensor chip with ﬂow buffer HBS - P ( 10 mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 005 % Surfactant P20 ) at a ﬂow rate of 10 m l / min , the Dextran matrix was activated with a 7 - minute pulse of 50 mM N - hydroxysuccinimide / 200 mM N - ethyl - N’ - ( dimethylaminopropyl ) - carbodiimide at a ﬂow rate of 10 m l / min . Subsequently caldendrin full - length was immobilized at the surface of the sensor chip cell by injecting a 7 - minute pulse of ligand solution ( 20 m g / ml of each ) . Finally the excess of reactive groups on the chip surface was deactivated with a 7 - minute pulse of 1 M ethanolamine hydrochloride pH 8 . 5 , at a ﬂow rate of 10 m l / min . For binding and complex stability studies GST - cortactin - SH3 ( 5 m M ) was injected on the immobilized caldendrin full - length surface diluted in the continuous ﬂow buffer HBS - P containing either 1 mM CaCl 2 or 1 mM EGTA . Injections were done in a 3 - minute pulse ( association time ) followed by a 3 - minute pulse with analysis buffer alone ( dissociation time ) and sensorgram was recorded for 60 min at ﬂow rate of 10 m l / min . For protein complex stability anal - ysis stability points were taken 30 min and 60 min after the ﬁrst stability point . For measuring binding kinetics between full length caldendrin and cortactin at physiological [ Ca 2 + ] , polyclonal goat anti - GST antibody was immobilized on CM5 chip surface as per standard protocol provided by GST capture kit ( GE healthcare ) followed by blocking minor fraction of high afﬁnity sites that are difﬁcult to regenerate . Assay condition for both ligand GST - cortactin and an - alyte caldendrin was assayed . Thereafter binding afﬁnity between cortactin and caldendrin was measured in HBSP running buffer e7 Neuron 97 , 1110 – 1125 . e1 – e14 , March 7 , 2018 containing 10 m M CaCl 2 . Association and dissociation constants were calculated using steady state afﬁnity model of Biacore X100 BIAevaluation software by picking the point at position 4 s before injection stops . For testing the interaction between caldendrin - Nt ( 60 amino acid ( aa ) ) with its second EF - domain , caldendrin EF - 2 domain was immobilized on CM5 chip as described above . Untagged caldendrin Nt ( 1 - 60aa ) was injected as analyte in the continuous ﬂow of HBS - P running buffer containing either 1 mM CaCl 2 or 1 mM EGTA . Experiments were repeated four times and quantiﬁcation was done using maximum binding points and stability points . SH3 domain of cortactin was immobilized on CM5 chip surface and association rate of caldendrin interaction was calculated by passing over caldendrin ( in presence of 500 m M Ca 2 + or EGTA in HBSP buffer ) and ﬁtting the obtained data using BIAevaluation software . In vitro actin assays F - actin sedimentation assay in HEK293T cells F - actin sedimentation assays were performed to study the role of caldendrin on the F - to G - actin ratio . HEK293T cells were tran - siently transfected with caldendrin - pcDNA3 . 1 or empty pcDNA3 . 1 vector as a control . As positive control untransfected HEK293T cells were pre - treated with 50 nM JPK or DMSO for 3 hours . Harvesting was done in 500 m l of prewarmed buffer containing TBS ( 20 mM Tris pH 7 . 4 and 150 mM NaCl ) , protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 100 m M ATP , and 50 nM JPK to protect existing ﬁlaments from depolymerization . After centrifugation the remove cell debris , the supernatant was collected and ultracenti - fugation was performed at 100000 x g for 1 h at 37 (cid:3) C . The resulting pellet was resuspended in the same volume of buffer . Pellet and supernatant samples were diluted with 4x SDS buffer , and run on SDS - PAGE and immunoblotted against a - actin ( mouse ) . G / F actin ratios were quantiﬁed and compared with non - tranfected HEK293T cells and JPK pre - treated cells using gel analysis PlugIn in ImageJ / Fiji ( Schindelin et al . , 2012 ) . Actin polymerization assay The actin polymerization assay was performed using Actin Polymerization BiochemKit ( Cytoskeleton , BK003 ) essentially according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Brieﬂy , the reactions were carried in dark 96 well plates in 320 m l volume and contained freshly solubilized 1 . 5 m M pyrene - labeled G - actin , 10 nM Arp2 / 3 Protein Complex ( Cytoskeleton , # RP01P ) , 400 nM WASP - VCA Domain - GST Protein ( Cytoskeleton , # VCG03 ) , 150 nM GST - cortactin or equimolar amount or GST control and 190 nM of untagged calden - drin . All other components were used according to the manual . The rate of actin polymerization was measured by monitoring the change in ﬂuorescence intensity of pyrene - actin using FLUOstar Omega plate reader ( BMG Labtech ) . Intensities were recorded with excitation at 355 nm and emission at 410 nm with 60 s time interval for about 1 hour . Actin depolymerization assay In vitro actin depolymerization assay was carried out as recommended by instructions for measuring coﬁlin - 1 activity ( Cytoskeleton , # CF01 ) . Fresh pyrene - labeled G - actin was polymerized into ﬁlaments as described above using Actin Polymerization BiochemKit ( Cytoskeleton , BK003 ) . Depolymerization reactions were performed in 150 m l volume . For the assay , recombinant coﬁlin - 1 was diluted to the ﬁnal concentration of 5 m M and used in 1 : 1 ratio with F - actin . Reactions were incubated for 30 min at the RT and ultracentrifuged at 100 . 000 x g for 1 h to pellet F - actin and associated proteins . Supernatant containing actin monomers and soluble proteins was transferred in a separate tubes and the pellet fraction was diluted in 150 m l of Tris buffer ( pH 8 . 0 ) . Samples were solubilized using 4x SDS loading dye and analyzed by SDS - PAGE and Coomassie blue staining . TIRF microscopy : in vitro actin assays For all experiments , coverslips and microscope slides were ﬁrst cleaned by sonication in Milli - Q H 2 O for 10 min , followed by succes - sive sonications in acetone and 70 % ethanol for 20 min each . Cleaned coverslips were stored in 0 . 5 M KOH at RT . Before use , coverslips were rinsed with Milli - Q H 2 O and dried at 60 (cid:3) C . Flow cells were assembled by attaching the coverslips to the microscope slides using Paraﬁlm that had been cut to form an approx . 5 3 20 mm ﬂow channel . The inside of the ﬂow channel was coated by subsequent incubation with 0 . 2 mg / ml PLL - PEG - biotin ( SuSos AG ) for 5 min , 1 mg / ml neutravidin ( Thermo Scientiﬁc ) for 10 min , and 5 mg / ml k - casein ( Sigma ) for 10 min . All reagents were diluted in PEM80 buffer ( 80 mM Pipes $ KOH , pH 6 . 8 , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 5 mM EGTA ) . To obtain actin ﬁlaments , actin monomers ( Cytoskeleton ; 1 mM ﬁnal , 25 % Alexa - 561 labeled ) were diluted into polymerization buffer ( ﬁnal concentration 10 mM imidazole , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 100 mM DTT , 0 . 4 mM ATP , 6 mg / ml glucose , 40 m g / ml cata - lase , 200 m g / ml glucose - oxidase ) and incubated at RT for 20 minutes . The ﬁlaments were then added into the ﬂow chamber ( 25 (cid:3) C , 95 % humidity ) and allowed to bind for 15 s . Unbound ﬁlaments were washed out using polymerization buffer , and spontaneous depolymerization was imaged using TIRF settings ( 300 ms exposure , 10 s intervals , 300 s duration ) . The buffer was then replaced by polymerization buffer containing the indicated proteins at different concentrations ( 3 m M caldendrin , 4 m M cortactin ) and the same imaging regime was repeated . Finally , polymerization buffer containing the same amount of caldendrin or cortactin , respec - tively , and additional 300 nM coﬁlin ( Cytoskeleton ) was added in the ﬂow channel and severing by coﬁlin was imaged as before . Image analysis was done using Fiji . For spontaneous depolymerization , kymographs of single ﬁlaments ( 20 - 40 ﬁlaments per conditions ) were generated and depolymerization rates were calculated from the slope of the graphs . For coﬁlin cutting rates , at least 40 ﬁlaments in the frame were selected and cuts that appeared in the ﬁrst 90 s after coﬁlin addition were counted . Neuron 97 , 1110 – 1125 . e1 – e14 , March 7 , 2018 e8 Cell culture and microscopy Cell culture , transfections , and replating assay For imaging experiments , cells were grown on 12 mm glass coverslips , for biochemical experiments in T75 culture ﬂasks or 10 cm Petri dishes as described in the experimental model and subject details . Transfection of cells was done using the PolyFect transfec - tion reagent ( QIAGEN GmbH , Hilden , Germany ) , MaxPEI ( 25000 , Polysciences ; HEK293T ) or Fugene6 ( Promega ; COS - 7 ) according to manufacturer’s instructions , at about 50 % – 60 % conﬂuency . In general , cells were used 48 h ( imaging ) and 24 h ( biochemistry ) after transfection . mCherry - cortactin and caldendrin - GFP plasmids were co - transfected into COS - 7 cells and cells were re - plated on glass coverslips after 1 day to induce high cytoskeleton dynamics , ﬁxed 4 h thereafter and imaged using Leica SP5 confocal microscope . Neuronal culture , transfections and lentiviruses Primary hippocampal rat cultures were prepared as described previously ( Kapitein et al . , 2010 ) . Dissociated hippocampal neurons from caldendrin + / + and (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice were prepared as recently described ( Spilker et al . , 2016 ) . In brief , hippocampi were dissected from male and female P0 + / + and (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice and cells were dissociated after 10 min treatment with trypsin at 37 (cid:3) C . Neurons were plated on plastic m - dishes ( Ibidi ) coated with poly - L - lysine ( Sigma - Aldrich ) at a density of 50000 cells for transfection purposes or for immuno - cytochemistry on poly - L - lysine coated glass coverslips at a density of 30000 cells per well in DMEM medium ( GIBCO , Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) supplemented with 8 % FCS , 1 % penicillin / streptomycin . Following attachment , cells were kept in Neurobasal medium ( GIBCO ) supplemented with 0 . 5 mM Glutamax , 2 % B27 , and 1 % penicillin / streptomycin ( all from GIBCO ) , at 37 (cid:3) C , 5 % CO 2 and 95 % humidity . Primary hippocampal mouse and rat cultures were transfected with lipofectamine 2000 ( Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) according to manufacturer’s instructions and as described previously ( Kapitein et al . , 2010 ) . For overexpression cells were trans - fected for 24 - 72 h , for the shRNA knock down 48 - 72 h . For rescue of shRNA effects , jasplakinolide was added at the indicated concentrations during the time of knockdown ( 48 h ) . Lentiviral particles for knockdown of caldendrin and cortactin were produced as described previously ( Sch € atzle et al . , 2016 ) . For knockdown experiments , 20 m l of virus solution was applied to primary cultures at DIV14 and DIV22 . MARCKS - GFP expression was induced by application of 500 ng / ml doxycycline 48 - 72 h prior to recordings . BDNF stimulations of primary neurons Stimulation of BDNF was done by addition of 50 - 100 ng BDNF in 1 mL medium per well of a 12 - well plate for time indicated . For spinning disc microscopy neurons were imaged over 1 h after stimulation . For morphological analysis neurons were stimulated for 2 h and immunostaining was performed as described below using following antibodies : mouse anti - bassoon and rabbit MAP2 . Immunocytochemistry Cells were ﬁxed in 4 % PFA for 10 min at RT and washed three times with PBS , before they were permeabilized in 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 in PBS for 10 min . After thoroughly washing , coverslips were incubated in blocking buffer ( BB ) for 1 h at RT . Incubation in primary antibodies was performed in BB at 4 (cid:3) C over night .

Dendritic segments were imaged with equal settings , but 4 x zoom and 0 . 3 m m z - steps . FRET assays in COS - 7 cells FRET acceptor bleaching experiments were used to study the dynamic conﬁrmation of caldendrin upon Ca 2 + binding in living cells . COS - 7 cells were grown on m - dishes ( Ibidi ) or on glass coverslips in 6 - well plates and transfected with YFP - caldendrin - CFP , YFP - CFP tandem construct or YFP and CFP in separate plasmids . Imaging was done in Ringer’s solution with or without CaCl 2 . For increasing intracellular Ca 2 + concentration cells were stimulated with 1 m M ionomycin and imaged within 5 - 20 min after this treatment . Experiments were performed on a SP5 CLSM systems ( Leica - Microsystems ) equipped with an Argon laser and acousto - optic tunable ﬁlters ( AOTF ) , controlled by LAS AF ( Leica Application Suite Advanced Fluorescence ) software , to choose suitable Argon laser lines . CFP was excited with 458 nm laser line and YFP with 514 nm laser line . YFP was bleached with 514 nm laser line with maximal power setting . All FRET - AB experiments were carried out in humidiﬁed chamber at 37 (cid:3) C and 5 % CO 2 . FRET efﬁciency ( E FRET ) was analyzed using Leica FRET - AB Wizard where E FRET was calculated as E FRET = ( D post - D pre ) / D post with D being donor ﬂuorescence before ( pre ) and after ( post ) acceptor bleaching . To test Ca 2 + and caldendrin - dependent change in conformation of cortactin , COS - 7 cells were transfected with YFP - cortactin - CFP alone or together with caldendrin . Experiments were performed in culturing medium as described above . In addition , as independent read out of interaction , spectral FRET was measured in cell extracts . HEK293T cells were transfected with constructs expressing YFP - cortactin - CFP fusion protein ( CFP as donor and YFP as acceptor ) and untagged caldendrin ( calden - drin in pcDNA3 . 1 ) for the experiment and CFP , YFP for negative control and tandem CFP - YFP for positive control .

Experiments were performed as described above . GFP was excited with 488 nm laser line and mCherry with 561 nm laser line . mCherry was bleached with 561 nm laser line with maximal power setting . Measurements were performed within maximum 1 hour after bicuculline stimulation . Protein turnover and FRAP experiments DIV20 / 21 mouse and DIV30 rat hippocampal cultures were treated with 50 m M bicuculline for 5 min and 15 min , respectively , in culturing medium and ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) directly afterward . Protein dynamics in spines was analyzed in DIV11 - 13 primary hippocampal cultures of cald + / + and (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice . Live imaging was performed using Leica SP5 microscope equipped with a 5 % CO 2 , 37 (cid:3) C humidiﬁed chamber and using the Leica software inbuilt FRAP wizard . Imaging settings were as follows : 63x objective ( HCX PL APO CS 63 . 0x1 . 40 oil objective ) and 4x zoom , 8bit , 512px , 8 . 3px / m m . Images were taken in 5 s ( FRAP ) or 10 s ( basal ) intervals . For FRAP experiments photo - bleaching of the ROI was achieved with 3 - 5 continues scans with maximum laser power at 488 nm after 5 baseline images . Afterward 25 post - bleach images with 5 s interval were taken . For rescue FRAP experiments DIV11 - 13 mouse hippocampal cultures were treated with 50 m M bicuculline for 5 min and imaged 8 h afterward . Fluctuations of spinous actin under basal conditions was measured in individual spines in hippocampal primary cultures DIV12 transfected with GFP - actin alone or co - expressed with mRuby2 . The average GFP value per spine was used to normalize each trace and the sum of absolute values between each 2 consecutive time points was calculated and deﬁned as total ﬂuctuations . FRAP efﬁciency was calculated using Fiji . ROIs were placed on individual ( bleached ) spines , on a non - bleached dendritic stretch as control and in the background . The intensities were measured using ‘Plot z axis proﬁle’ option .

Glutamate uncaging experiments Organotypic hippocampal slice cultures Organotypic hippocampal slice cultures ( OHSC ) were prepared from male and female P9 cald (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice and cald + / + littermates as described previously ( Gogolla et al . , 2006 ) . Mice were decapitated , brains removed , placed in preparation medium ( HAME - 01 Prep Medium , Cell Concepts , Umkirch , Germany ) and hippocampi dissected under a binocular . Perpendicular slices of 350 - 400 m m thickness were cut using a McIlwain tissue chopper ( Mickle Laboratory Engineering , Surrey , UK ) . After carefully sepa - rating the slices in fresh preparation medium , only excellent quality slices were transferred onto millicell membranes ( 4 slices per membrane , Merck Millipore ) placed in 6 well - plates with pre - warmed and CO 2 equilibrated 1 mL OHSC medium . Slices were cultured at 37 (cid:3) C , 5 % CO 2 , humidity . Feeding of slices was performed by exchanging 0 . 9 ml of medium at DIV2 and thereafter every 3 days . Single cell electroporation At DIV5 , individual CA1 neurons were transfected by single - cell electroporation at an upright microscope ( Dodt contrast ) as described previously ( Wiegert et al . , 2017 ) . Single - cell electroporation was conducted in extracellular solution containing ( in mM ) : 145 NaCl , 10 HEPES , 25 D - glucose , 2 . 5 KCl , 1 MgCl 2 , 2 CaCl 2 ( pH 7 . 4 , 318 mOsm ) . Plasmids were diluted ( 30 ng syn - mRuby2 or 40 - 50 ng syn - eYFP ) in potassium - based intracellular solution containing ( in mM ) : 135 K - gluconate , 0 . 2 EGTA , 4 MgCl 2 , 4 Na 2 - ATP , 0 . 4 Na - GTP , 10 Na 2 - phosphocreatine , 3 ascorbate , 0 . 02 Alexa Fluor 594 , and 10 HEPES ( pH 7 . 2 ) . Neurons were transfected by 50 hyperpolarizing pulses ( (cid:1) 12 mV , 0 . 5 ms , at 50 Hz ) delivered by an Axoporator 800A ( Axon Instruments ) . After transfection the slices were placed back in their original culturing medium , for morphology analyses slices were ﬁxed in 4 % PFA / 4 % sucrose one day after and mounted with mowiol . For two - photon glutamate uncaging experiments slices were used 2 to 4 days after electroporation . Two - photon glutamate uncaging Two - photon glutamate uncaging was performed on an Olympus FV1000 upright microscope controlled by FluoView software . Excitation was provided by a pulsed Ti : : sapphire laser ( Mai Tai , Spectra Physics ) tuned to 920 nm . Fluorescence was collected through an Olympus XLPlanN 25x MP , 1 . 05 NA water dipping objective and a 495 - 540nm emission ﬁlter . Slices were submerged in recirculating bubbled ( 95 % O 2 , 5 % CO 2 ) Mg 2 + free ACSF ( in mM : 119 NaCl , 26 . 2 NaHCO 3 , 11 C 6 H 12 O 6 , 1 NaH 2 PO 4 , 2 . 5 KCl , 3 CaCl 2 , pH 7 . 4 , 30 - 32 (cid:3) C ) containing 2 . 5 mM MNI - caged - L - glutamate ( Tocris ) and 0 . 001 mM TTX ( Tocris ) . Spines on the secondary or tertiary branch of oblique dendrites were targeted for potentiation . After imaging of a 15 minute baseline , glutamate was uncaged by tuning the laser to 720 nm and application of 60 pulses , 1 ms at 1 Hz . Laser intensity at the back focal plane ranged approximately between 15 and 20 mW . Following uncaging the spine volume was monitored for 1 h . For analyses spine size was estimated by the integrated intensity within a circular ROI surrounding the spine head using Fiji . Background was subtracted by measuring the intensity within an equally sized ROI away from the recorded dendrite . To estimate changes in spine size , the ﬂuorescence from individual spines was normalized to the ﬂuorescence during a 15 minute baseline . Spines that did not respond to the uncaging stimulus were excluded ( < 20 % increase 2 min after uncaging ) . Electrophysiology in acute hippocampal slices Field recordings Hippocampus from 8 - 11 weeks old male mice ( cald + / + mice and cald (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice ) were cut using a vibratome ( LeicaVT1000S , Nussloch , Germany ) into 350 m m thick slices . These hippocampal slices were incubated for 2 h in carbogenated ( 95 % O 2 / 5 % CO 2 ) artiﬁcial cerebrospinal ﬂuid ( ACSF , containing in mM : 110 NaCl , 2 . 5 KCl , 2 . 5 CaCl 2 $ 2H 2 O , 1 . 5 MgSO 4 $ 7H 2 O , 1 . 24 KH 2 PO 4 , 10 . 0 glucose , 27 . 4 NaHCO 3 , pH 7 . 3 ) at 31 ± 1 (cid:3) C . Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials ( fEPSPs ) were evoked by stimulation of CA1 Schaffer - collateral ﬁbers with biphasic rectangular current pulses ( 200 m s / polarity , frequency 0 . 033Hz ) in a range of 4 - 5V through ACSF ﬁlled glass capil - lary microelectrodes ( 3 - 5 M U ) . fESPSs were recorded using ACSF ﬁlled capillary microelectrodes and ampliﬁed by an extracellular ampliﬁer ( EXT - 02B , npi , Germany ) and digitized at a sample frequency of 5 kHz by a Digidata 1401plus AD / DA converter ( CED , England ) . Stimulation strength was adjusted to 40 % – 50 % of the maximum fEPSP - slope values . L - LTP was induced by tetanization consisting of three 1 s stimulus trains at 100 Hz with a 6 min inter - train interval . JPK was dissolved in DMSO , and diluted in ACSF to the ﬁnal concentration 50 nM . It was washed in 30 min before tetanization and washed out 50 min after tetanization . Input / Output curve were tested by different stimulus intensities ( V ) . Picrotoxin was applied in a concentration of 100 m M . Paired - pulse facilitation was measured by different interpulse intervals ( ms ) . LTD was induced by low frequency stimulations ( 900 stimuli at 1 Hz ) . e11 Neuron 97 , 1110 – 1125 . e1 – e14 , March 7 , 2018 Patch - clamp and calcium ﬂuxes recordings Transverse 400 m mslices from the right hippocampus of adult cald + / + and (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice ( 10 - 15 weeks old ) were cut with a vibratome ( Leica VT1000S ) in ice - cold ACSF solution . Slices were incubated at 34 (cid:3) C for 25 min and subsequently held at room temperature . For measuring miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents ( mEPSCs ) the extracellular solution contained in mM : 124 NaCl , 4 . 9 KCl , 2 MgSO 4 , 2 CaCl 2 , 1 . 2 KH 2 PO 4 , 25 . 6 NaHCO 3 , 20 glucose , 1 m M TTX , 10 m M bicuculline and 10 m M APV . The intracellular solution contained in mM : 140 potassium gluconate , 10 EGTA , 10 HEPES , 2 MgCl 2 , 1 CaCl 2 , 4 NaATP and 0 . 4 GTP . For measuring the NMDA to AMPA ratio the extracellular solution contained in mM : 124 NaCl , 4 . 9 KCl , 2 MgSO 4 , 2 CaCl 2 , 1 . 2 KH 2 PO 4 , 25 . 6 NaHCO 3 , 20 glucose and 10 m M bicuculline . The intracellular solution contained in mM : 120 CsMeSO 4 , 30 TEA , 10 EGTA , 5 MgCl 2 10 HEPES , 4 NaATP and 0 . 4 GTP . A stimulation electrode was placed in the stratum radiatum to stimulate the Schaffer collaterals . The stimulation strength was adjusted to get an EPSC at (cid:1) 90 mV of around 200 pA . Neurons were held at (cid:1) 90 mV for measuring AMPA - mediated - EPSCs and at + 50 mV for measuring NMDA - mediated - EPSCs . For measuring calcium ﬂuxes in CA1 pyramid spines a commercial two - photon laser - scanning Femto2D microscope from Femtonics ( Budapest , Hungary ) was used . Laser pulses at 810 nm were provided by a Ti : Sapphire femtosecond laser ( Cameleon Ultra I , Coherent ) . Cells were ﬁlled with Alexa Fluor 594 and Fluo 5F through the patch pipette . For measuring Ca 2 + signals , green ( Fluo 5F ) and red ( Alexa Fluor 594 ) ﬂuorescence were collected during 500 Hz line scans across the spine head after a short current injection to the soma ( 1 nA for 5 ms ) . Fluorescence changes were quantiﬁed as the increase in green ﬂuorescence normalized to the average red ﬂuorescence ( D G / R ) . Fluorescence was collected through the objective ( 60 3 1 . 0 NA , Olympus ) and the oil immersion condenser ( 1 . 4 NA , Olympus ) with two pairs of photomultipliers . The composition of the intracellular solution for these experiments was in mM : 130 potassium gluconate , 20 HEPES , 2 MgCl 2 , 2 Mg - ATP , 0 . 3 Na - GTP , 0 . 25 Fluo - 5F and 0 . 1 Alexa 594 . Patch pipettes ( 3 – 5 M U ) were pulled from thick - walled borosilicate glass tubing . Recordings were performed with an EPC9 patch - clamp ampliﬁer . Data were acquired and stored using Patchmaster and analyzed with Fitmaster and Minianalysis . Behavior Cannula implantation and drug delivery Caldendrin + / + and (cid:1) / (cid:1) male littermates were acutely injected with JPK according to the method of intrahippocampal injection described previously ( Albrecht et al . , 2013 ) . Mice were anesthetized with intraperitoneal sodium pentobarbital injection ( 50 mg / kg , Sigma - Aldrich , Seelze , Germany ) and placed on a stereotactic frame ( World Precision Instruments , Berlin , Germany ) . A bilateral 26 G guide cannula ( C235GS - 5 - 2 . 0 / SPC , Plastic One Inc . , USA ) was stably implanted targeting the CA1 area of the dorsal hippocam - pus . The guide cannula placement was anterioposterior ( AP ) (cid:1) 1 . 94 mm ; mediolateral ( ML ) ± 1 mm from Bregma and dorsoventral ( DV ) 1 . 5 mm below pedestal from the brain surface . Guide cannulae were secured and closed with dummy cannulae to prevent clog - ging and were covered with dust caps . Mice were single caged and allowed to recover from surgery for 12 days before drug infusion and behavioral testing . On the day of testing , mice were brieﬂy anesthetized with isoﬂurane and 33 G internal cannulae were inserted to extend 0 . 2 mm beyond the tip of the guide cannulae ( total depth 1 . 7 mm ) . JPK was dissolved in 0 . 9 % saline at a ﬁnal concentration of 50 nM . Mice received bilateral infusions of either JPK or 0 . 9 % saline serving as vehicle ( VEH ) ( 1 . 5 m l / side at 0 . 5 m l / min ) , 30 min before the ﬁrst exposure to the test apparatus . After the completion of the behavioral task injection sites were veriﬁed histologically . To this end mice were infused with 0 . 5 m l / side ( 1 : 10 in 0 . 9 % saline ) red retrobeads ( Lumaﬂuor Inc . , USA ) according to the infusion protocol described above and two days later were transcardially perfused with 4 % PFA . Brains were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and 30 m m - thick coronal sections were made and analyzed under Leica DMI 6000 CS ﬂuorescence microscope ( Leica Microsystems , Germany ) . Novel object recognition The effect of JPK administration on hippocampus dependent memory was assessed using a novel object recognition assay . 3 - 6 month - old male mice were divided into four groups , cald (cid:1) / (cid:1) infused with VEH ( 9 ) and JPK ( 9 ) and cald + / + infused with VEH ( 9 ) and JPK ( 8 ) . Training and testing were done in an open ﬁeld square arena made out of gray plastic ( 50 cm x 50 cm ) . To ensure a low basal stress level , experimental animals were brieﬂy handled before the behavior paradigm . 30 min after infusion , mice were habituated in the empty arena for 20 min . Then , two identical objects were introduced to the maze and mice were allowed to explore the objects , in two training sessions , each lasting 20 minutes . In the memory test phase , 2 h after the end of the second training , one familiar object was replaced with an object that was unfamiliar to the animal ( novel object ) . The object positions were kept constant between trials , butrandomized between animals to exclude potential spatial bias . Object exploration was measured and recorded via the ANY - maze ( Video Tracking System , version 4 . 50 , Stoelting Co . , Wood Dale ) and ‘‘object exploration’’ was deﬁned as object - directed movement at a distance % 2 cm from the object and / or touching it with the nose . The experimental design and layout is shown in the Figure S8C . Data are expressed as novel recognition index ( RI ) , i . e . , the time spent investigating the novel object relative to the total object investigation ( time at novel + time at familiar object ) and statistically tested against chance level ( 0 . 5 ) , reﬂecting equal exploration of both objects . Open ﬁeld and elevated plus maze tests Open ﬁeld and elevated plus ( EPM ) maze tests were performed as described previously ( Albrecht et al . , 2013 ) . In short , for the ﬁrst test mice were placed in the center of an open ﬁeld arena and were allowed to freely explore the area at low light conditions ( 10 lux ) . Mice behavior was recorded online via the ANY - maze video tracking system . The total traveled distance during the test session was Neuron 97 , 1110 – 1125 . e1 – e14 , March 7 , 2018 e12 analyzed , and the time spent in the center of the open ﬁeld ( 10 cm x10 cm ) was determined to assess anxiety - related behavior . Time spent in open and closed arms in EPM test were recorded at similar conditions during a 5 min test . QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Analysis of dendritic morphology In hippocampal slices only pyramidal neurons of CA1 without close by transfected other cells were included in the analysis . Equal distribution of cell position for knockout and wild - type slices was given and analysis was done by a researcher blind to mouse genotype . Neurons were traced using the simple neurite tracer plugin ( Longair et al . , 2011 ) of the Fiji software in z stacks . Measure - ment of dendritic length and Sholl analysis ( dendritic intersections with concentric circles around some in 10 m m distance steps ) was done using the above mentioned plugin . Analysis in primary culture was performed in wideﬁeld ﬂuorescence images using the same plugin or by drawing concentric circles around the soma and manually counting the number of intersections . 3D reconstructions and spine analysis in Imaris Spine characteristics in control or BDNF treated primary neurons were analyzed using Imaris software ( Bitplane , Belfast , United Kingdom ) . 0 . 4 m m stacks imaged at Leica SP5 confocal microscope were imported into Imaris 7 . 7 . 1 and a Gaussian blur ﬁlter with 1 px ( 0 . 12 m m ) ﬁlter width was applied in the GFP channel before reconstruction . Dendrites were built using the auto - path option of the ﬁlament tracer and default settings . Detection of spines was done using following settings : 0 . 15 m m minimal head size , 0 . 6 m m maximum length , seed point threshold approx . 10 , no branched spines were allowed . To rebuild spine diameters the shortest distance from distance map was used . Spine detection was manually corrected if necessary . Classiﬁcation of spines into stubby , mushroom - like and ﬁlopodia was performed using the Imaris XTension classify spines with following deﬁnitions : stubby : spine length < 1 m m ; mushroom : spine length < 3 m m and spine head width R 0 . 5 m m ; ﬁlopodia : true . Analysis of spine morphology in organotypic hippocampal slices was performed on deconvolved images . Confocal stack images of dendritic segments of CA1 pyramidal neurons expressing mRuby2 in hippocampal slice cultures were deconvolved using Auto - QuantX3 ( Media Cybernetics ) as follows : adaptive point spread function ( PSF ) , blind deconvolution ( with theoretical PSF ) in two dimensions , one iteration and medium noise suppression for mRuby2 . Afterward a 1 px 2D Gaussian blur ﬁlter was applied in Fiji and resulting images used for 3D reconstruction and analysis using Imaris 8 . 1 . Dendrites were built using the auto - path option of the ﬁlament tracer and default settings . Detection of spines was done as described above . Classiﬁcation of spines into stubby , mushroom - like and ﬁlopodia was performed using the Imaris XTension ’classify spines’ according to the following deﬁnitions : spines : length ( spine ) < 1 or ( length ( spine ) < 3 and max _ width ( head ) > = 0 . 3 ) , ﬁlopodia : true . Quantiﬁcation of synaptic puncta OpenView software was used to analyze cortactin staining intensities in synapses ( Tsuriel et al . , 2006 ) . Shortly , bassoon positive puncta were identiﬁed in maximum projections of confocal images by setting regions of interest around local intensity maxima ( Box _ puncta _ Ex ) . Cortactin was measured within square areas containing identiﬁed bassoon puncta , if cortactin also showed local intensity maxima ( match set ) . Size of areas was deﬁned as boxes with 16 px length and width , corresponding to approx . 1 m m ) . Surface AMPAR was measured within square areas containing identiﬁed homer puncta if AMPAR also showed local intensity maxima ( match ) . Spine numbers in cald + / + and (cid:1) / (cid:1) cultures were counted manually by a researcher blind to experimental group in maximum projections of confocal images . Only spots in close proximity to the dendrite with clear overlapping ﬂuorescence of shank2 and syn - aptophysin were counted independent of spot size . Spines were counted on dendritic stretches of approximately 30 m mlength . Spine numbers for caldendrin overexpression and knockdown experiments were counted manually along approx . 30 m m long dendritic segments in overlay images of GFP , b - galactosidase - HA and synapsin ﬂuorescence by a researcher blind to experimental group . Analysis of actin distribution in spine heads The distribution of actin in the heads of mushroom - like spines of DIV14 primary hippocampal neurons of cald + / + and (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice was analyzed in STED images of 2 independent phalloidin - Atto647N stained cultures under basal conditions and after 5 min of bicuculline stimulation ( 50 m M ) . Line scan analysis from the tip of the spine ( presynaptic bassoon staining as reference ) to the spine neck was performed using Fiji option ‘plot proﬁle’ . Intensities of individual spines were normalized to the length of the spine head and to the highest intensity values . The distribution of actin within the spine head was analyzed using a custom - written script in MATLAB ( R2015a , MathWorks , Inc ) . In short , a circular ROI was placed on the middle of the spine head completely covering the spine head . The ROI was divided into 12 equally sized sectors ( 4 quadrants each subdivided into 3 sectors ) with the spine neck always facing the same direction . Phalloidin - Atto647N intensities were measured in each of the sectors based on pixel intensities ( 16 - bit ) and normalized to the total amount of Phalloidin - Atto647N per spine head . These values were plotted in a color code . Additionally , for each quadrant the ratio of the inner most sector versus the other 2 combined were calculated and plotted in the rose plots as actin enrichment ratios . At last , for each spine head we estimated the weighted center of mass including pixel values of all the pixels within the ROI . To compare spines , we normalized the coordinates ( (cid:1) 100 to + 100 ) of the center of mass to the ROI size with coordinates 0 , 0 as center of the spine head . e13 Neuron 97 , 1110 – 1125 . e1 – e14 , March 7 , 2018 Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed in Prism 6 . 05 ( GraphPad , La Jolla , CA , USA ) .
