However , the underlying mechanism is not fully understood . In this study , RNA - seq was performed and we noticed that inhibition of NORFA led to dramatic transcriptomic alterations in porcine GCs . A total of 1 , 272 differentially expressed transcripts were identiﬁed , including 1167 DEmRNAs and 105 DEmiRNAs . Furthermore , protein – protein interaction , gene - pathway function , and TF – miRNA – mRNA regulatory networks were established and yielded four regulatory modules with multiple hub genes , such as AR , ATG5 , BAK1 , CENPE , NR5A1 , NFIX , WNT5B , ssc - miR - 27b , and ssc - miR - 126 . Functional assessment showed that these hub DEGs were mainly enriched in TGF - β , PI3K - Akt , FoxO , Wnt , MAPK , and ubiquitin pathways that are essential for GC states ( apoptosis and proliferation ) and functions ( hormone secretion ) . In vitro , we also found that knockdown of NORFA in porcine GCs signiﬁcantly induced cell apoptosis , impaired cell viability , and suppressed 17 β - estradiol ( E2 ) synthesis . Notably , four candidate genes for sow reproductive traits ( INHBA , NCOA1 , TGF β - 1 , and TGFBR2 ) were also identiﬁed as potential targets of NORFA . These ﬁndings present a panoramic view of the transcriptome in NORFA - reduced GCs , highlighting that NORFA , a candidate lincRNA for sow fertility , is crucial for the normal states and functions of GCs . Keywords : NORFA , pig , granulosa cells , RNA - seq , sow fertility INTRODUCTION In mammalian ovaries , follicular development is a crucial biological process for follicle maturation , ovulation , and female fertility ( Botta et al . , 2017 ) . However , more than 99 % of follicles undergo atresia during each stage of follicular development ( Kaipia and Hsueh , 1997 ; Liu et al . , 2014 ) . As the main threat to female ovarian function , severe follicular atresia leads to follicular development arrest , premature follicles failure ( PFF ) , and even infertility ( Meng et al . , 2017 ; Yeung et al . , 2017 ) . It is generally believed that the fate of follicles is mainly determined by the state of granulosa cells ( GCs ) ( Yu et al . , 2004 ; Matsuda - Minehata et al . , 2006 ) . Increasing evidence has also suggested that GC apoptosis and non - apoptotic programmed cell death are the main causes of follicular Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www . frontiersin . org 1 February 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 610553 fcell - 09 - 610553 February 17 , 2021 Time : 20 : 21 # 2 Du et al . NORFA Is Crucial in GCs atresia ( Shen et al . , 2017 ; Zhang et al . , 2018 ) . Recent studies have suggested that GC apoptosis is mediated by a complicated regulatory network consisting of multiple crucial factors that can be divided into two categories , exogenous factors ( i . e . , environmental factors and oxidative stress ) ( Li et al . , 2019a ; Spears et al . , 2019 ) and endogenous factors ( i . e . , steroid hormones , cytokines , and epigenetic regulators ) ( Yang et al . , 2017 ; Li et al . , 2018a , 2019b ) . In the ﬁrst two decades of this century , a bunch of microRNAs ( miRNAs ) and circRNAs have been identiﬁed by using high - throughput sequencing technology and further proved to be involved in the regulation of follicular development , especially for GC states and functions ( Du et al . , 2016 , 2018 ; Guo et al . , 2019 ) . However , the roles of long non - coding RNAs ( lncRNAs ) in follicular atresia and GC apoptosis have not been fully characterized . LncRNAs are a class of RNA transcripts that are more than 200 nucleotides ( nt ) in length and lacking of the protein - coding potential or open reading frame ( ORF ) ( Canzio et al . , 2019 ) . Unlike the protein - coding RNAs , lncRNAs are relatively unstable , are less evolutionary conserved , have lower abundance , and have species - or tissue - speciﬁc expression patterns , which results in the large unknown about the roles , functions , and regulatory mechanisms of lncRNAs ( Ransohoﬀ et al . , 2018 ) . Compared to the mature miRNAs , which are mainly located in the cytoplasm and inhibit target gene expression at the post - transcriptional level , the location and regulatory mechanisms of lncRNAs are more complex ( Kopp and Mendell , 2018 ) . It has been reported that lncRNAs can be located in both cytoplasm and nucleus , which are involved in the control of multiple crucial biological processes by regulating gene expression in cis or in trans manners ( Engreitz et al . , 2016 ; Uszczynska - Ratajczak et al . , 2018 ) . Although thousands of lncRNAs in human or other organisms have been identiﬁed by high - throughput sequencing technology , only a few of them are well characterized ( Liu et al . , 2018 ; Stojic et al . , 2020 ) . Notably , only several lncRNAs including lncRNA - Neat1 ( Nakagawa et al . , 2014 ) , lncRNA - HUPCOS ( Che et al . , 2020 ) , and lncRNA - PVT1 ( Liu et al . , 2020 ) have been reported to be involved in the regulation of ovarian functions , such as steroid hormone secretion and corpus luteum formation . However , the role of lncRNAs in regulating follicular development , GC state , and functions remain unknown . It has been well documented that 17 β - estradiol ( E2 ) , the principal form of estrogens , is produced by adrenals and ovarian GCs and crucial for estrus cycle , ovarian development , follicular maturity , and ovulation ( Baerwald et al . , 2012 ; Herbison , 2020 ) . E2 secretion is the most important function of female ovarian GCs , which also feedback regulates the transcriptome and the states ( such as proliferation and apoptosis ) of GCs in an autocrine manner ( Ciesiolka et al . , 2017 ; Liu et al . , 2019 ) . In recent years , E2 synthesis in female ovarian GCs has been proved to be regulated by a bunch of epigenetic regulation factors including miRNAs , circRNAs , and lncRNAs ( Li et al . , 2018a ; Huang et al . , 2020 ) . For lncRNAs , only lncRNA - Gm2044 ( Hu et al . , 2019 ) and lncRNA - SRA ( Li et al . , 2018b ) have been proved to inﬂuence E2 synthesis and secretion in mammalian ovarian GCs through regulating the expression of Cyp19a1 , but which are all studied in mice . However , it is still unclear whether lncRNAs can regulate E2 synthesis in porcine ovarian GCs . In our previous study , we have identiﬁed a pig - speciﬁc novel functional lincRNA ( NORFA ) in porcine GCs , which is 739 nt in length with two exons and transcript from pig chromosome 1 , and further demonstrate that NORFA is the ﬁrst candidate lincRNA for sow fertility through inhibiting follicular atresia ( Du et al . , 2020 ) . However , little is known about the role of NORFA in porcine GCs . This study aims to comprehensively investigate the transcriptomic alteration of porcine GCs induced by knockdown of NORFA and further primarily detect the role of NORFA in the regulation of the normal states and functions of porcine GCs . MATERIALS AND METHODS Animal Ethics A total of 50 healthy and sexually mature commercial large white sows ( average 180 days , and average mass 110 kg ) randomly selected from Zhunshun Biological Technology Co . ( Nanjing , China ) were involved in this study for bilateral ovaries collection and GC isolation . The studied sows were healthy , unstimulated , and taken care of by animal welfare . All the experiments involving animals in this research were approved and supervised by the Animal Ethics Committee of Nanjing Agricultural University , Nanjing , Jiangsu , China [ SYXK ( Su ) 2015 - 0656 ] . Cell Culture and Treatment The sows were slaughtered according to the animal ethics and the fresh ovaries were collected and placed in a ﬂask ﬁlled with 37 ◦ C normal saline , which were then sent back to the laboratory within 1 h . Porcine GCs were derived from 3 - to 5 - mm non - atretic follicles by using the syringes with 22 - gauge needles and cultured into six - well plates ﬁlled with DEME / F12 medium ( # 11320033 , Invitrogen ) with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS , # 30044333 , Gibco ) and 1 % penicillin / streptomycin , which were then placed in a 37 ◦ C incubator with humidiﬁed atmosphere and 5 % CO 2 for 24 h as described previously ( Du et al . , 2018 ) . For siRNA , miRNA , and plasmid transfection , Lipofectamine 3000 reagent ( # L13778 - 150 , Invitrogen ) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions . The oligonucleotide sequences used in this study were synthesized by GenePharma ( Shanghai , China ) and listed as follows : NORFA - speciﬁc small interfering RNA ( siNORFA ) , 5 (cid:48) - CAG ACA GAU GUG GAU GAA UTT - 3 (cid:48) ( Sense ) , 5 (cid:48) - UGU GGU UGA UGU UGU UGG CTT - 3 (cid:48) ( Anti - sense ) ; NC - siRNA ( siNC ) , 5 (cid:48) - UUC UCC GAA CGU GUC ACG UTT - 3 (cid:48) ( Sense ) , 5 (cid:48) - ACG UGA CAC GUU CGG AGA ATT - 3 (cid:48) ( Anti - sense ) . pcDNA3 . 1 - NFIX , the eukaryotic expression vector for porcine NFIX , was constructed in our previous study ( Du et al . , 2020 ) . For pan - caspase inhibitor treatment , porcine GCs were seeded into six - well cell culture plates for 36 h , and the medium was then replaced with serum - free DMEM / F12 medium for 12 h . Subsequently , Z - VAD - FMK ( # MK3270 - 1MG , MKBio , Shanghai , China ) , a well - known pan - caspase inhibitor , was added Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www . frontiersin . org 2 February 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 610553 fcell - 09 - 610553 February 17 , 2021 Time : 20 : 21 # 3 Du et al . NORFA Is Crucial in GCs to the medium to a ﬁnal concentration of 50 µ M . All the experiments were repeated in triplicate . RNA Isolation , Library Preparation , and Sequencing After transfection for 24 h , total RNA from porcine GCs were isolated and puriﬁed by using TRIzol reagent ( # 15596018 , Invitrogen ) . The quantity and quality of the puriﬁed RNA were detected by a NanoDrop 3000 spectrophotometer ( Agilent Technologies , United States ) . The degradation and contamination of the total RNA were estimated by running on a 1 . 0 % agarose gel , and an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer ( Agilent Technologies , United States ) was used to detect the integrity of each sample . Each group has three independent samples , and the total RNA from the same treatment group were diluted and equally mixed to avoid the intra - species diﬀerences . Thus , a total of two RNA libraries were established for sequencing . Before the preparation for RNA - seq , the transfection eﬃciency and knockdown eﬃciency of siNORFA in porcine GCs were detected and validated . Subsequently , the cDNA libraries for sequencing were prepared as previously described ( Du et al . , 2019 ) . Brieﬂy , after removing rRNA , total RNA was broken into 100 - to 150 - nt fragments and cDNA was synthesized and puriﬁed by using QIAquick PCR Puriﬁcation kit ( # 28104 , QIAGEN ) , which was subsequently sent to Biomarker Technologies Co . Ltd . ( Beijing , China ) for sequencing . Paired - end sequencing of 150 bases length was performed by using an Illumina HiSeq3000 . The total clean tags were checked and genome mapping was performed by HISAT2 software ( Kim et al . , 2015 ) ; the reads and sequences were obtained with the background of Sus Scrofa RefSeq ( Sscorfa 11 . 1 ) database . Subsequently , the known and novel transcripts were identiﬁed . The full raw transcriptome sequencing data sets have been submitted to sequence read archive ( SRA ) database of NCBI ( SRR11793932 , SRR11793933 , SRR11793934 , and SRR11793935 , Bioproject ID : PRJNA632987 ) . Identiﬁcation of the Differentially Expressed Transcripts The total clean tags were extracted and low - quality reads were removed by using Perl scripts designed by Biomarker Technologies Co . Ltd . ( Beijing , China ) . After quantile normalization , sequencing data of each gene in all samples were normalized as fragments per kilobase of transcript sequence per million mapped reads ( FPKM ) . The expression level changes of each transcript were transformed with log2 , and the signiﬁcance was adjusted to the control for false discovery rate ( FDR ) . For miRNAs , their expression levels were corrected and normalized by using the TPM algorithm on an R - studio software . Diﬀerentially expressed mRNA ( DEmRNAs ) and miRNAs ( DEmiRNAs ) were identiﬁed as a result of comparison the transcriptomes between control group and NORFA - inhibited group , and detected by DESeq R package v1 . 10 . 1 ( Anders and Huber , 2010 ) and IEDG6 tool ( Romualdi et al . , 2003 ) according to their corresponding protocols , respectively . The signiﬁcant diﬀerentially expressed transcripts were identiﬁed with a cutoﬀ criteria of adjusted FDR < 0 . 05 and | Log 2 ( fold change ) | ≥ 0 . 59 ( or | fold change | > 1 . 5 ) . Functional Analysis of DEmRNAs and DEmiRNAs To identify the potential functions and roles of DEmRNAs , and their involved biological processes , Gene Ontology ( GO ) analyses were performed by using the Database for Annotation , Visualization and Integrated Discovery 1 ( DAVID v6 . 8 ) . To identify the signaling pathways that DEmRNAs were mainly enriched in , Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ( KEGG ) analyses were performed by using the KOBAS online analysis tool 2 . To analyze the functional annotation and miRNA – pathway interaction of DEmiRNAs , the targets of DEmiRNAs were ﬁrstly identiﬁed by using miRWalk 3 . 0 , TarBase , and TaregetScan online miRNAs software . Subsequently , DIANA - miRPath v 3 . 0 database 3 was used to analyze the functions of DEmiRNAs according the methods as previously described ( Vlachos et al . , 2015 ) . The signiﬁcance of P < 0 . 05 and enrichment score ≥ 2 were set as the thresholds for both DEmRNAs and DEmiRNAs . To further evaluate the alteration trend of the signiﬁcant enriched GO terms in NORFA - reduced porcine GCs , z score was calculated based on the expression pattern of the DEGs , which were enriched in each GO term . Protein – Protein Interaction ( PPI ) Network Construction To construct the eﬀective NORFA - mediated PPI network , all the function - known DEmRNA - encoded proteins were selected , and the network was established as previously described ( Du et al . , 2019 ) . Brieﬂy , all the interactions ( validated and predicted ) between DEG - encoded proteins were analyzed and generated by using STRING v11 . 0 online statistical analysis software 4 ( Szklarczyk et al . , 2019 ) with the basic settings : the interacted protein amount ≥ 1 and the minimum required interaction score ≥ 0 . 7 [ 0 – 1 ] . The PPI network was subsequently visualized by using Cytoscape v3 . 7 . 2 software ( Shannon et al . , 2003 ) . The nodes with higher degrees ( top 5 % ) were considered as hub genes and identiﬁed using Cytohubba function . The diﬀerent modules in the PPI network were identiﬁed by Cytoscape software MCODE package function . DEmiRNA – DEmRNA Regulatory Network Construction To construct the NORFA - mediated DEmiRNA – DEmRNA regulatory network , the identiﬁed targets of DEmiRNAs were ﬁrstly obtained using DIANA - TarBase database 5 . The common genes between DEmRNAs and validated target genes of DEmiRNAs were considered as signiﬁcant diﬀerentially expressed target genes . Furthermore , DEmiRNAs and common 1 http : / / david . ncifcrf . gov / 2 http : / / kobas . cbi . pku . edu . cn / anno _ iden . php 3 http : / / www . microrna . gr / miRPathv3 / 4 http : / / string - db . org / 5 http : / / carolina . imis . athena - innovation . gr Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www . frontiersin . org 3 February 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 610553 fcell - 09 - 610553 February 17 , 2021 Time : 20 : 21 # 4 Du et al . NORFA Is Crucial in GCs DEmRNA targets with opposite expression patterns were chosen for DEmiRNA – DEmRNA regulatory network construction using Cytoscape v3 . 7 . 2 software . To further assess the potential functions of this miRNA – mRNA regulatory network , DAVID database was used to analyze the signiﬁcant enriched GO annotation and KEGG pathways . Hub miRNAs were deﬁned as the miRNA nodes that had higher degree ( top 10 % ) in the DEmiRNA – DEmRNA regulatory network . Potential DETF – DEmiRNA Regulatory Network Construction To construct the potential NORFA - mediated DETF ( diﬀerentially expressed transcription factor ) – DEmiRNA regulatory network , the candidate promoters of DEmiRNAs were analyzed by Promoter 2 . 0 prediction server 6 , and the potential transcription factors within these promoters were identiﬁed by using JASPAR online database 7 , which is an open - access database of curated , non - redundant TF binding proﬁles . The DETFs were considered as the common molecules between DEmRNAs and candidate TFs that target the DEmiRNAs mentioned above . The similarity of binding motif ≥ 0 . 9 [ 0 – 1 ] and the interacted DEmiRNA amount ≥ 1 were set as the thresholds for DETFs . The DETF – DEmiRNA regulatory network was constructed and visualized by using Cytoscape v3 . 7 . 2 software . The TFs and miRNAs with higher degrees ( top 5 % ) were considered as hub nodes in the DETF – DEmiRNA regulatory network . Quantitative Real - Time PCR ( qRT - PCR ) Validation for RNA - Seq Analysis Quantitative real - time PCR ( qRT - PCR ) was performed to conﬁrm the accuracy of RNA - seq analysis and detect the expression pattern of crucial genes . In brief , 1 µ g of total RNA derived from porcine GCs in the control group or the siNORFA treatment group was reverse - transcribed into cDNA by using HiScript III RT SuperMix for qPCR with gDNA wiper ( # R323 - 01 , Vazyme Biotech Co . , Ltd . , Nanjing , China ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Twelve DEmRNAs and six DEmiRNAs , which are crucial for cell states and functions , were selected for validation . qRT - PCR was conducted on an ABI 7500 System ( Applied Biosystems ) with three independent biological repeats by using AceQ qPCR SYBR Green Master Mix ( # Q111 - 03 , Vazyme Biotech Co . , Ltd . , Nanjing , China ) , and the original experimental data were analyzed using 2 − (cid:49)(cid:49) CT method . GAPDH and U6 were selected to normalize the expression levels of coding and non - coding genes , respectively . Each group has three independent samples and qRT - PCR has been performed in triplicate . The primers used are listed in Supplementary Table 1 . Western Blotting Porcine GCs were lysed with cold RIPA buﬀer and total proteins were collected . The concentration of each protein sample was detected by BCA method ( # P0012 , Beyotime 6 http : / / www . cbs . dtu . dk / services / Promoter / 7 http : / / jaspar . genereg . net / Biotechnology ) . Equal amounts of total protein ( 15 µ g ) were loaded and separated on 4 – 20 % SDS - PAGE gel to measure the expression levels of interested proteins ; Western blotting assays were performed as described previously ( Du et al . , 2020 ) . The primary antibodies used in this study were anti - Caspase3 / cleaved - Caspase3 ( # 19677 - 1 - AP , Proteintech , 1 : 1 , 000 ) , anti - PCNA ( # 13110 , Cell Signaling Technology , 1 : 1 , 000 ) , anti - MCM2 ( # 4007s , Cell Signaling Technology , 1 : 1 , 000 ) , anti - NFIX ( # F3250 , Aﬃnity , 1 : 1 , 000 ) , and anti - GAPDH ( # TA802519 , ORIGENE , 1 : 2 , 000 ) . Corresponding HRP - conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Sangon Biotech ( Shanghai , China ) and diluted in 0 . 25 % BSA / TBST . The protein level of GAPDH was detected as an internal control . Morphometric Analysis In order to analyze the eﬀects of knockdown of NORFA on the morphology of porcine GCs , morphometric analysis was performed after 24 - h transfection with siNORFA . The high - solution images of porcine GCs were obtained from Odyssey Imaging System ( LI - COR Biosciences ) . The detection area was randomly selected , and the analysis was performed with three independent samples per group . Caspase3 Activity Detection Assay Caspase3 Activity Assay kit ( # C1115 , Beyotime Biotechnology ) was used to detect the activity of Caspase3 in control or NORFA - reduced porcine GCs according to the manufacturer’s instruction . In brief , GCs were collected and lysed with 100 µ l of cold lysis buﬀer for 15 min . After 16 , 000 g centrifugation for 15 min at 4 ◦ C , 50 µ l of supernatant was transferred into a new tube and incubated with 10 µ l of Ac - DEVD - p NA ( 2 mM ) at 37 ◦ C for 2 h . Then , the activity of Caspase3 in NORFA - reduced porcine GCs was measured and indicated by the absorbance at 405 nm . Cell Viability Assay and Apoptosis Detection Cell viability was performed with TransDetect cell counting kit - 8 ( CCK - 8 ) ( # FC101 , Transgen ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . In brief , 2 , 000 porcine GCs were seeded in 96 - well cell culture plates . After treatment for the indicated time , 10 µ l of CCK solution was added to the medium for 2 h and the absorbance was detected at 450 nm with a microplate reader . The cell viability was calculated with the following equation : ( OD treatment − OD control ) / OD control . Each group has six independent replicates . For cell apoptosis measurement , Annexin V - FITC / PI Apoptosis Detection kit ( # A211 , Vazyme , China ) was purchased and performed according to the manufacturer’s instruction . Brieﬂy , 20 , 000 cells were collected and washed with cold PBS twice , and subsequently dyed with Annexin V - FITC and PI in the dark room for 10 min , and ﬁnally they were sorted by FACS on a cell counting machine . The apoptosis rate was determined using the following equation : ( cell number in the right quadrants ) / ( total cell number ) .

NORFA - Mediated PPI Network Construction and Module Identiﬁcation To construct the NORFA - mediated PPI network , 965 protein - coding DEmRNAs were chosen for interaction analysis by using STRING online database and the Cytoscape v3 . 7 . 2 visualization tool . As shown in Figure 4 , a total of 462 nodes ( 295 up - and 167 down - regulated DEmRNAs ) and 1 , 334 edges exist in the NORFA - mediated PPI network . After analysis , the enrichment P value is less than 1 . 00E − 16 , the average node degree ( AND ) is 3 . 27 , and the average local clustering coeﬃcient ( ALCC ) is 0 . 537 , indicating that the NORFA - mediated PPI network has relatively high reliability . Also , 25 nodes with high degree ( top 5 % ) were identiﬁed as hub genes ( Supplementary Table 5 ) , among which CENPE , SMC3 , KIF18A , PPP2CB , CENPF , KIF2A , CUL5 , KIF11 , CUL3 , and CASC5 are the top 10 nodes with high degree ( average degree ≥ 21 ) . Besides , qRT - PCR was performed and results showed that the expression patterns of these 10 hub genes in NORFA - inhibited porcine GCs were consistent with the RNA - seq data ( Supplementary Figure 2 ) . Furthermore , four signiﬁcant enriched modules ( termed modules I , II , III , and IV ) were identiﬁed in the PPI network . The signiﬁcant enriched signaling pathways in which DEmRNAs within these four modules were participating in were identiﬁed by KEGG analyses and showed that these modules were mainly associated with the pathways involved in cell cycle , proliferation , apoptosis , steroid hormone synthesis , and ubiquitin - mediated proteolysis ( Figure 4 ) , suggesting that NORFA has an important role in regulating multiple biological processes in porcine GC . Identiﬁcation and Functional Analyses of the DEmiRNAs in NORFA - Reduced Porcine GCs In addition to DEmRNAs , 105 diﬀerentially expressed miRNAs ( DEmiRNAs , 23 up - and 82 down - regulated ) were also identiﬁed by RNA - seq with the following criteria of FDR < 0 . 05 and | fold change | ≥ 1 . 5 , and several crucial miRNAs for ovarian GCs , such as miR - 122 and miR - 27a - 5p , were also diﬀerentially expressed ( Figure 5A and Supplementary Table 6 ) . According to fold change , the expression patterns of DEmiRNAs were detected by constructing DEmiRNA - mediated heatmaps ( Supplementary Figure 1B ) . After analysis , the top 10 up - and down - regulated DEmiRNAs are listed in Table 2 , among which , novel - miR - 619 and novel - miR - 318 are the most up - and down - regulated DEmiRNA , respectively . To further assess the potential roles and functions of the 105 DEmiRNAs in NORFA - reduced porcine GCs , the identiﬁed targets of DEmiRNAs were analyzed and GO analyses were conducted . A total of 104 signiﬁcant GO terms ( P < 0 . 05 , micro T - threshold > 0 . 8 ) including three categories ( 88 GO terms in BP , 6 GO terms in CC , and 10 GO terms in MF ) were identiﬁed by using the miRPath v3 . 0 database ( Supplementary Table 7 ) , and top 30 GO terms were presented in Figure 5B . In the BP category , “cellular nitrogen compound metabolic process” is the most signiﬁcant enriched GO term , while “organelle” and “ion binding” are the most signiﬁcant enriched GO terms in the CC and MF categories , respectively .

NORFA Is Crucial in GCs FIGURE 3 | Multiple crucial genes were inﬂuenced by NORFA in porcine GCs . A total of 12 key DEmRNAs that are essential for cell states and functions were selected , and their expression patterns in porcine GCs treated with siNORFA were validated by qRT - PCR ( n = 3 ) .

The columns represent qRT - PCR results by referring to the right y - axis ( mean ± S . E . M . ; n = 3 ) . Furthermore , KEGG analyses showed that the DEmiRNAs were mainly enriched in 45 signaling pathways ( P < 0 . 05 , Supplementary Table 8 ) , which are involved in regulating cell growth , proliferation , apoptosis , death , and functions , such as TGF - β , FoxO , PI3K - Akt , cAMP , insulin , hippo , and Wnt signaling pathways ( Figure 5C ) . Furthermore , six important DEmiRNAs were selected for qRT - PCR validation , and the results were highly consistent with RNA - seq data ( Figure 5D ) . These observations not only indicate a high accuracy in our RNA - seq data but also demonstrate that multiple crucial miRNAs in porcine GCs are regulated by NORFA . Construction and Functional Annotation of NORFA - Mediated DEmiRNA – DEmRNA Regulatory Network To construct the NORFA - mediated DEmiRNA – DEmRNA regulatory network , we ﬁrst analyzed the targets of DEmiRNAs and a total of 3 , 210 validated targets were identiﬁed , including 142 common genes with DEmRNAs in the sequencing data ( Figure 6A ) . With the interaction between DEmiRNAs and their target DEmRNAs ( Supplementary Table 9 ) , the DEmiRNA – DEmRNA regulatory network containing 185 nodes and 274 edges was established ( Figure 6B ) . After analysis , 15 DEmiRNAs ( 8 down - and 7 up - regulated ) and 142 DEmRNAs ( 83 down - and 59 up - regulated ) exist in the network . Among them , novel - miR - 517 and ssc - miR - 7137 with high degree were considered as hub miRNAs . Besides , functional assessment of the DEmRNAs in the network showed that they are mainly enriched in PI3K - Akt , TGF - β , FoxO , MAPK , Ras , Rap1 , and ubiquitin signaling pathways ( Figure 6B ) . In addition , pathway - function co - expression patterns were analyzed to estimate the eﬀects of this regulatory network on porcine GCs and showed that the NORFA - mediated DEmiRNA – DEmRNA regulatory axes play important roles in regulating the states ( apoptosis , proliferation , and survival ) and functions ( response to stress and hormone secretion ) of porcine GCs ( Figure 6C ) . Furthermore , the interactions between miR - 27a and 15 target DEmRNAs in this network were also validated by qRT - PCR . As shown in Figures 6D , E , overexpression of miR - 27a dramatically inhibited the mRNA levels of 12 targets in porcine GCs but does not aﬀect the expression of BRCA2 , TGF β 2 , and DROSHA , indicating high reliability of NORFA - mediated DEmiRNA – DEmRNA regulatory network .

NORFA Is Crucial in GCs FIGURE 4 | Identiﬁcation of the NORFA - mediated protein – protein interaction network . The NORFA - mediated protein – protein interaction ( PPI ) network was constructed based on the DEmRNAs obtained from RNA - seq results . A total of 462 protein - coding DEmRNAs ( nodes ) were identiﬁed in the PPI network . Color scale depicts the expression pattern of DEmRNAs and ranges from blue to red ( red indicates up - regulated and blue indicates down - regulated ) . Degrees are shown as the size of the nodes . The dotted areas indicate four signiﬁcant modules ( module I in orange , module II in red , module III in green , and module IV in blue ) . The most enriched signaling pathways ( P < 0 . 05 ) represented by the four modules are depicted . Construction of the Potential DETF – DEmiRNA Interaction Network in NORFA - Reduced Porcine GCs To further investigate the NORFA - mediated DETF – DEmiRNA regulatory network , 38 DETFs were ﬁrst identiﬁed from 1 , 167 DEmRNAs , and only 13 of which have been reported to be able to target 20 common DEmiRNAs between 105 DEmiRNAs and 288 DETF – target miRNAs ( Figure 7A ) . As shown in Figure 7B , the NORFA - mediated DETF – DEmiRNA regulatory network containing 33 nodes and 151 edges was constructed with the interaction between 13 DETFs ( 6 down - and 7 up - regulated ) and 20 common DEmiRNAs ( 17 down - and 3 up - regulated ) , which has been also listed in Supplementary Table 10 . After analysis , NFIC and miR - 24 - 2 with the highest degrees were considered as the hub DETF and DEmiRNA in this regulatory network , respectively . To detect the accuracy of the network , the expression levels of nine DEmiRNAs ( the potential targets of NFIX ) in NFIX overexpressed porcine GCs were determined and the qRT - PCR results showed that their expression patterns were similar to the RNA - seq data ( Figures 7C – E ) , indicating that NORFA regulates the expression of miRNAs in porcine GCs partially in a TF - dependent manner . Knockdown of NORFA Impairs the Normal States and Functions of Porcine GCs Based on the transcriptomic data and bioinformatic analysis results , we hypothesized that NORFA is essential for the normal states and functions of porcine GCs . To address this , the eﬀects of siNORFA on porcine GCs were identiﬁed . Morphometric analysis showed that shrink and jagged edges occurred in NORFA - reduced porcine GCs ( Figure 8A ) , indicating that knockdown of NORFA destroyed the membrane integrity of porcine GCs and led to low cell viability , which was further proved by cell viability assay ( Figure 8B ) and proliferation - associated protein level detection ( Figure 8C ) . Furthermore , siNORFA treatment signiﬁcantly induced porcine GC apoptosis and increased Caspase3 activity and cleaved - Caspase3 protein level ( Figures 8C – E ) . As the most important function of GCs , E2 secretion is crucial for follicular development . Here , we also detected the E2 synthesis in NORFA - inhibited porcine GCs and validated that knockdown of NORFA dramatically inhibited the E2 secretion ( Figure 8G ) , and the inhibitory eﬀorts cannot be rescued by Z - VAD - FMK ( a pan - caspase inhibitor ) , indicating that knockdown of NORFA suppresses E2 synthesis not through inducing porcine GC apoptosis .

DISCUSSION Follicular development is inﬂuenced by a complex regulatory network consisting of steroid hormones , growth factors , and epigenetic factors ( Cao et al . , 2018 ) , which are not fully identiﬁed . With the continuous development and improvement of high - throughput sequencing technology , the mono - mics sequencing technology ( genomics , transcriptomics , proteomics , and metabolomics ) and multi - omics joint analysis have been well improved ( Rappoport and Shamir , 2019 ) .

For example , genomics and transcriptomics have been applied to detect the crucial genes and RNA molecules ( i . e . , mRNAs and miRNAs ) at diﬀerent stages of follicular development in human , pig , and goat ( Zou et al . , 2020 ) . RNA - seq has become an innovative method for quantifying the transcriptome signatures , and high - throughput RNA - seq has been considered as a standard strategy and an indispensable tool for transcriptome - wide alteration in diﬀerent tissues , species , and conditions ( Stark et al . , 2019 ) . In the current study , we have employed an RNA - seq strategy to characterize the transcriptome proﬁles in NORFA - reduced porcine GCs and attempted to identify the crucial downstream targets of NORFA . In the present study , the transcriptome - wide analysis was performed and 1 , 272 diﬀerentially expressed transcripts ( 1 , 167 DEmRNAs and 105 DEmiRNAs ) were identiﬁed in NORFA - inhibited porcine GCs . Function annotation by GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses showed that NORFA might be involved in multiple crucial biological processes and molecular functions , such as metabolism , biosynthesis , response to stress , cell death , TF binding , transcription , enzyme regulation , etc . , through aﬀecting important signaling pathways , including TGF - β , PI3K - Akt , Wnt , FoxO , Hippo , cAMP , estrogen , and progesterone synthesis , and ubiquitin - mediated proteolysis signaling pathways . The potential functions of DEmRNAs were also assessed , and they were closely associated with the states and functions of porcine GCs . For example , ATM , ATG5 , BAD , BAK1 , BAX , BCL2L1 , MCL1 , and XIAP are reported to be involved in cell apoptosis ( Youseﬁ et al . , 2006 ; Hellmuth and Stemmann , 2020 ) , which is consistent with the ﬁndings in our previous study ( Du et al . , 2020 ) and may partially explain the anti - apoptotic eﬀects of NORFA on GCs . CCNJ , CCNT1 , and CCNE2 are associated with cell cycle ( Mohamed et al . , 2018 ) . Besides , BRCA1 , TGF - β 1 , TGF - β 2 , TGFBR2 , SMAD2 , PIK3CA , PTEN , and WNT5B are cell proliferation regulators ( Miyoshi et al . , 2012 ) . CYP11A1 , CYP19A1 , HSD3B1 , HSD17B1 , and NR5A1 are associated with estradiol ( E2 ) biosynthesis and secretion ( Fuentes and Silveyra , 2019 ) . In addition , UBA6 , USP1 , USP9X , USP16 , USP25 , and NOVA1 are ubiquitin factors and responsible for proteolysis ( Chen et al . , 2019a ; Raimondi et al . , 2019 ) . Moreover , AR , PIK3R1 , TAB2 , and TGFBR2 are crucial for cytokine and steroid hormone responses ( Hata and Chen , 2016 ) . Based on these DEmRNAs , we hypothesize that NORFA also plays an important role in regulating the state ( cell cycle , proliferation , and autophagy ) and functions ( E2 synthesis ) of porcine GCs , which has been partially validated in the present study ( Figure 8 ) . In vitro assays proved that knockdown of NORFA signiﬁcantly induced porcine GC apoptosis , impaired the normal morphology and cell viability , and dramatically inhibited E2 synthesis . Interestingly , we also noticed that NFIX , a transcription factor targeting the promoter of NORFA ( Du et al . , 2020 ) , is dramatically down - regulated in NORFA - reduced porcine GCs , indicating that a positive feedback regulatory network between NORFA and NFIX exists . Apart from the well - known genes , 202 function - unknown DEmRNAs were identiﬁed and further research will focus on investigating their functions . MicroRNAs are a class of short non - coding RNA ( ∼ 21 – 25 nt ) , which inhibit the expression of target genes by binding to their 3 (cid:48) - UTR in a base - pairing manner ( Treiber et al . , 2019 ) . Nowadays , miRNAs are well - known to be involved in a wide range of cellular biological processes , including cell proliferation , diﬀerentiation , apoptosis , and even diseases , which are usually under the control of lncRNAs . For instance , lncRNA - MIR100HG has been proved to mediate cell apoptosis by inﬂuencing the expression of miR - 100 and miR - 125b ( Lu et al . , 2017 ) .

( C ) The NORFA - mediated pathway – function interactions were analyzed . ( D ) The expression level of miR - 27a in porcine GCs treated with miR - 27a mimics was detected by qRT - PCR ( n = 3 ) . ( E ) The interactions between miR - 27a and its potential targets within the DEmiRNA – DEmRNA regulatory network were measured by qRT - PCR ( n = 3 ) . Data in ( D ) and ( E ) were presented as mean ± S . E .

In this study , a total of 105 DEmiRNAs ( 23 up - and 82 down - regulated ) were identiﬁed in NORFA - inhibited porcine GCs . Interestingly , miR - 126 is one of the signiﬁcantly up - regulated miRNAs , which is consistent with our previous ﬁnding that NORFA negatively regulates the expression of miR - 126 by acting as a competing endogenous RNA ( ceRNA ) ( Du et al . , 2020 ) . Besides , multiple DEmiRNAs have been reported to play vital roles in ovaries . For example , miR - 26b regulates porcine GC apoptosis by directly inhibiting SMAD4 ( Liu et al . , 2014 ) . miR - 424 / SMAD7 and miR - 27a / NFAT5 signal axis are actively involved in regulating GC proliferation and cycle progression in cow and mouse ( Pande et al . , 2018 ; Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www . frontiersin . org 12 February 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 610553 fcell - 09 - 610553 February 17 , 2021 Time : 20 : 21 # 13 Du et al .

Besides , it has been reported that the expression levels of miR - 451 and miR - 193a - 3p in GCs are closely associated with follicular development and diminished ovarian reserve in human and cow ( Sontakke et al . , 2014 ; Jiang et al . , 2017 ; Kleaveland et al . , 2018 ) . Thus , we provide a hypothesis that NORFA may have multiple important functions in porcine GCs via a speciﬁc miRNA - dependent manner . It is worth noting that DROSHA , a miRNA processing enzyme encoding gene , is signiﬁcantly up - regulated in NORFA - reduced porcine GCs , which may partially lead to the occurrence of multiple DEmiRNA after NORFA was knocked down . Moreover , we have identiﬁed 83 novel and function - unknown DEmiRNAs , which required deep investigation for their functions . More importantly , the NORFA - mediated miRNA – mRNA regulatory network was constructed and partially validated ( Figure 6E ) , which demonstrates that miRNAs is crucial for the regulation of lincRNAs , such as NORFA , to the expression of target genes , especially at the post - transcription level . In recent years , the regulatory mechanism of lncRNA on other RNAs has become a hotspot in biological and medical science , especially for the regulation to miRNAs ( Kleaveland et al . , 2018 ) . Nowadays , several diﬀerent mechanisms have been identiﬁed , including interaction with chromatin - modifying complexes , epigenetic modiﬁers , miRNA processing factors , and transcriptional regulatory proteins ( Kiontke et al . , 2019 ) , and by which lncRNAs could inﬂuence the biogenesis and expression of miRNAs . Our ﬁndings in this study identiﬁed three potential mechanisms for NORFA regulation of miRNAs : ( i ) acting as a ceRNA of miRNAs such as miR - 126 , which is the same as most lncRNAs ; ( ii ) recruiting speciﬁc transcription Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www . frontiersin . org 13 February 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 610553 fcell - 09 - 610553 February 17 , 2021 Time : 20 : 21 # 14 Du et al .

Importantly , we have partially validated the mechanism ( ii ) in this study by identifying the eﬀects of NFIX , a NORFA - induced TF , on the expression of its target miRNAs ( Figure 7E ) , which indicates that lincRNAs , such as NORFA , may function through TF – miRNA interaction networks . Further studies should focus on whether TFs , like NFIX , regulate the transcription of miRNAs directly or dependent on several transcription co - regulators , and the role of lincRNAs during this process . However , mechanisms ( iii ) need to be veriﬁed by future investigations . It is worth noting that if negative correlations are identiﬁed between lncRNAs and miRNAs , two mechanisms may contribute to the regulation process : ceRNA ( Thomson and Dinger , 2016 ) and target - directed miRNA degradation ( TDMD ) ( Ghini et al . , 2018 ) . ceRNA method has already been well characterized , while TDMD is a newly identiﬁed mechanism for speciﬁc miRNA degradation ( Sheu - Gruttadauria et al . , 2019 ) . In this research , multiple NORFA - induced DEmiRNAs were identiﬁed and whether the mechanisms mentioned above are involved in this regulatory network need further validation . It is well known that sow fertility mainly determines the production and proﬁts of pig industry ( Cordoba et al . , 2015 ) . In the last century , multiple crucial genes including ESR1 , FSH β , OPN , RBP4 , PRLR , and BMP15 have been considered as candidate genes for sow reproductive traits ( Rothschild et al . , 1996 ; Zhao et al . , 1998 ) . With the development of high - throughput sequencing technology , several novel candidate genes ( e . g . , ARID1A , IGF2 , and VEGFA ) and multiple mutations ( e . g . , ALGA01051183 , rs55618224 , and IGFBP2 g . 455 A > T ) that are associated with sow reproductive traits ( e . g . , litter size and ovulation rate ) were identiﬁed by whole - genome sequencing and genome - wide association study ( Munoz et al . , 2010 ; Sell - Kubiak et al . , 2015 ; Chen et al . , 2019b ) . Previous studies about screening of candidate genes for sow reproductive traits mainly focused on coding genes , while research on the candidate lncRNA selection for sow reproductive performance has just started and NORFA is the ﬁrst identiﬁed candidate lincRNA aﬀecting the high proliﬁcacy of Erhualian pigs . In the current study , several candidate genes for sow reproductive traits are also diﬀerentially expressed in NORFA - reduced porcine GCs , such as NCOA1 ( Korwin - Kossakowska et al . , 2002 ) , TGF β - 1 ( Wu et al . , 2010 ) , INHBA , and TGFBR2 ( Li et al . , 2020 ) . Their expression patterns were also determined by qRT - PCR ( Supplementary Figure 3 ) , and results indicate that NORFA may form a regulatory network with these candidate genes and inﬂuence sow reproductive traits and fertility . Based on the diverse functions and speciﬁc expression patterns , we believe that lincRNAs , such as NORFA , are more suitable as candidate genes for the reproductive traits of female mammals . CONCLUSION In summary , our research provides a worthy strategy to characterize the cellular and transcriptomic alteration in Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www . frontiersin . org 14 February 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 610553 fcell - 09 - 610553 February 17 , 2021 Time : 20 : 21 # 15 Du et al . NORFA Is Crucial in GCs NORFA - inhibited porcine GCs for the ﬁrst time . We have found that NORFA is essential for the normal states and function ( E2 synthesis ) of porcine GCs , and knockdown of NORFA leads to dramatic changes in GC transcriptome . More importantly , we have further conﬁrmed that NORFA is a candidate gene for sow fertility by controlling several known candidate genes for sow reproductive traits , which provides opportunities to identify potential therapeutic RNA molecules for inhibiting follicular atresia and female infertility .
