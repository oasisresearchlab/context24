Rev . Lett . , February 8 , 2002 ) We show that the formation of membrane tubes ( or membrane tethers ) , which is a crucial step in many biological processes , is highly non - trivial and involves ﬁrst order shape transitions . The force exerted by an emerging tube is a non - monotonic function of its length . We point out that tubes attract each other , which eventually leads to their coalescence . We also show that detached tubes behave like semiﬂexible ﬁlaments with a rather short persistence length . We suggest that these properties play an important role in the formation and structure of tubular organelles . PACS numbers : 87 . 16 . Dg , 82 . 70 . - y , 87 . 68 . + z Biological membranes ( such as the endoplasmic reticulum , the Golgi apparatus , the inner mitochondrial membrane , or the plasma membrane ) often form highly dynamic tubular net - works [ 1 ] . The formation and transport of membrane tubes ( with tens of nanometers in diameter ) are thought to involve motor proteins that are able to grab the membrane and pull on it as they move along the ﬁlaments of the cytoskeleton [ 2 ] . Nanotubes ( or tethers ) can also be pulled out by vari - ous experimental techniques ( such as hydrodynamic ﬂow [ 3 ] , micropipettes [ 4 ] , or optical tweezers [ 5 ] ) , and very recently Roux et al . [ 6 ] have managed to set up a minimal in vitro ex - perimental system , in which tubes have been pulled by kinesin motor proteins . The physics of long tubular membranes is rel - atively simple and is well understood . However , the initial formation of nanotubes from planar or large spherical pieces of membrane is a subtle process , the understanding of which is crucial to the study of various biological processes ( involv - ing tube formation or simply membrane pulling ) . In addition to tube formation we also study the interaction of membrane tubes pulled from the same membrane , and make a few com - ments on the mechanical properties of detached membrane tubes . Living cells maintain the surface tension of most of their membranes at a constant level by keeping lipid reservoirs ( at ﬁxed chemical potentials ) [ 5 ] . A constant pressure in closed vesicles is also maintained via osmosis . Therefore , for our study we choose the ensemble in which the surface tension σ and the inside pressure p ( relative to the outside ) are ﬁxed rather than the surface area of the membrane A or the volume of the vesicle V . With the bending term included the free energy of the mem - brane can be written as [ 7 ] F = Z κ 2 ( 2 H ) 2 d A + σA − pV − fL , ( 1 ) where κ is the bending rigidity and H is the mean curvature of the membrane . The membrane is pulled in the Z direc - tion with a point force f , and the end - to - end distance of the membrane in this direction is denoted by L . For a tube of length L and radius R the free energy ( at p = 0 ) can be written as F tube = [ κ / ( 2 R 2 ) + σ ] 2 πRL − fL . To minimize F tube the surface tension acts to reduce the ra - dius , while the bending rigidity works against this . The bal - ance between the two sets the equilibrium radius R 0 and force f 0 , which can be calculated by taking ∂ F tube / ∂R = 0 and ∂ F tube / ∂L = 0 : R 0 = r κ 2 σ , f 0 = 2 π √ 2 σκ . ( 2 ) For typical values of κ ≈ 40 pNnm and σ ≈ 0 . 05 pN / nm one ﬁnds R 0 ≈ 20 nm and f 0 ≈ 12 . 6 pN . For simplicity we consider only axisymmetric surfaces with the Z axis being the symmetry axis ( Fig . 1a upper inset ) . Such surfaces can be parametrized by the angle ψ ( S ) , where S is the arclength along the contour . The coordinates R ( S ) and Z ( S ) depend on ψ ( S ) through ˙ R = cos ψ and ˙ Z = − sin ψ , ( 3 ) and the mean curvature can be expressed as 2 H = ˙ ψ + ( sin ψ ) / R . ( 4 ) For axisymmetric surfaces one can derive the so - called gen - eral shape equation from the free energy ( 1 ) by variational methods [ 8 , 9 ] : ψ ··· = − 1 2 ˙ ψ 3 − 2 cos ψ R ¨ ψ + 3 sin ψ 2 R ˙ ψ 2 + 3 cos 2 ψ − 1 2 R 2 ˙ ψ + ¯ σ ˙ ψ − cos 2 ψ + 1 2 R 3 sin ψ + ¯ σ R sin ψ − ¯ p , ( 5 ) where ¯ σ = σ / κ = 1 / ( 2 R 20 ) and ¯ p = p / κ . Taking the ﬁrst integral of this equation leads to [ 9 ] ¨ ψ cos ψ = − 1 2 ˙ ψ 2 sin ψ − cos 2 ψ R ˙ ψ + cos 2 ψ + 1 2 R 2 sin ψ + ¯ σ sin ψ − 1 2 ¯ pR − ˜ f R , ( 6 ) with the integration constant ˜ f = f / ( 2 πκ ) = f / ( f 0 R 0 ) . 2 For nearly ﬂat membranes ( ψ ≪ 1 ) , after the parameter change [ ψ ( S ) , R ( S ) ] → ψ ( R ) , one can expand the shape equation ( 6 ) in powers of ψ and keep only the terms up to linear order : R 2 ψ ′′ + Rψ ′ − ( R 2 ¯ σ + 1 ) ψ = − ˜ fR − ¯ pR 3 / 2 . ( 7 ) Because of the parameter change , the primes denote deriva - tions with respect to R ( which , in linear order of ψ , are iden - tical to derivations with respect to S ) . The general solution of this differential equation is ψ ( R ) = ˜ f ¯ σ 1 R + 1 2 ¯ p ¯ σ R + c 1 I 1 ( R √ ¯ σ ) + c 2 K 1 ( R √ ¯ σ ) , ( 8 ) where I i ( x ) and K i ( x ) are modiﬁed Bessel functions , and c 1 and c 2 are integration constants . I 1 ( R √ ¯ σ ) diverges expo - nentially for R → ∞ . Because for a big vesicle we expect the shape to converge to that of a sphere , c 1 must vanish . At R = 0 the divergence of the 1 / R term must be canceled by the K 1 term , leading to c 2 = − ˜ f / √ ¯ σ . Integrating − ψ ( R ) with respect to R gives the shape of the membrane in this linear approximation : Z lin ( R ) = Z 0 − 2 R 0 f f 0 (cid:20) ln (cid:18) R √ 2 R 0 (cid:19) + K 0 (cid:18) R √ 2 R 0 (cid:19)(cid:21) − R 2 2 R ves , ( 9 ) where the integration constant Z 0 serves as a reference coor - dinate , and we have expressed σ , κ , and p in terms of R 0 , f 0 , and vesicle radius R ves = 2 σ / p . The last term is a trivial con - tribution , describing a spherical vesicle under tension σ and pressure p . The second term , which is proportional to f , is the linear response , and describes the deformation of the vesicle . The quantity between the brackets converges to [ ln ( 2 ) − γ ] for R → 0 , where γ = 0 . 577 . . . is the Euler constant . For p = 0 and large R the logarithmic term dominates , which cor - responds to a catenoid , the well known shape of a soap ﬁlm in cylindrical geometry under zero pressure . Because the pressure makes only a trivial contribution , and has a negligible effect on tube formation from big vesicles ( plug pR ≈ pR 0 = 2 σR 0 / R ves ≪ σ into the shape equa - tions ) , we neglect it from now on , and consider a piece of ( initially ﬂat ) membrane that spans a ring of radius R ring lo - cated at Z = 0 . For large deformations ( or pulling forces ) the linear approx - imation breaks down , and we have to solve Eq . ( 5 ) together with Eq . ( 3 ) numerically . Note that Eq . ( 6 ) could also be used , but it is numerically less stable . We start solving the differential equations from the ring , where we impose a zero curvature ( or free hinge ) boundary condition . Thus , the four initial parameters at Z = 0 are as follows : ( i ) R = R ring ; ( ii ) ψ = arcsin [ f / ( 2 πσR ring ) ] − ε , where the small deviation ε from the catenoid shape is chosen ( with a shooting and match - ing technique ) such that the contour line reaches the Z axis ; ( iii ) ˙ ψ = − ( sin ψ ) / R ensures zero mean curvature [ see Eq . ( 4 ) ] ; ( iv ) ﬁnally , ¨ ψ is determined from Eq . ( 6 ) . The results of the numerical solution can be seen in Fig . 1 . The main part of Fig . 1a shows the shape ( contour line ) of the ( a ) ( b ) 2000000 20000 = 20 R / R 0 Z / R 0 Z ψ R S L / R 0 0 f / f R ring / R 0 R / R 0 lin L tube L 0 / R 0 / R Z / R 0 0 L / R tube L 0 / R 0 f / f 10 15 5 0 −5 −100 5 10 15 20 25 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 1 . 2 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 −20 −15 −10 −5 0 5 10 15 20 0 . 9 1 . 2 1 . 1 0 5 15 10 1 FIG . 1 : ( a ) The shape of an emerging tube at various lengths . The upper inset shows the parametrization of the surface , and the lower one illustrates the deﬁnition of L tube , which is the size of the de - viation of the shape from the linear approximation ( dashed line ) . ( b ) Force vs . length curves for three different ring sizes . The inset shows the f - L tube curve ( solid line ) and its asymptotic ﬁt by Eq . ( 13 ) ( dashed line ) . membrane for R ring = 20 R 0 and different values of L . For small deformations ( left line ) Eq . ( 9 ) gives a very good ap - proximation of the shape . In this linear regime the size of the deformation is approximately L lin = Z lin ( 0 ) − Z lin ( R ring ) . For larger deformations a tube emerges in the middle , and the linear approximation fails . However , far from the tubular part , where ψ is small , the approximation is still valid ( Fig . 1a lower inset ) . Thus , it is convenient to deﬁne the tube as the piece between L lin and L , and the base as the rest of the mem - brane between 0 and L lin . This way , the dependence of the size of the total deformation L on the ring radius R ring is ab - sorbed in the size of the base L lin , and the length of the tube L tube = L − L lin ( i . e . , the deviation from the linear approxi - mation ) becomes independent of R ring . With this deﬁnition it is enough to determine the f - L curve for one particular ring size ( e . g . , 20 R 0 ) , from which the uni - versal ( ring size independent ) f - L tube curve can be calcu - lated ( Fig . 1b inset ) . Because only the f - L curves have real 3 physical meaning , one can easily calculate them from the f - L tube curve for any ring radius ( ≫ R 0 ) by simply adding L lin ( f , R ring ) to L tube . The most intriguing feature of the f - L curves ( shown in Fig . 1b for three different values of R ring ) is their non - monotonicity . The force ﬁrst grows linearly , in accordance with the linear approximation ( 9 ) , and converges to f 0 for large L . But in between it overshoots by ∼ 0 . 13 f 0 , and then oscillates about f 0 with an exponentially decaying amplitude . This oscillation results in inﬁnitely many intervals with negative slopes , which , in the f - ensemble ( where f is the control parameter rather than L ) , are mechanically unstable and represent an inﬁnite series of ﬁrst order shape transitions at f 0 . Because L lin is a monotonically increasing function of both f and R ring , the main peak becomes an overhang for large rings ( > 20000 R 0 ) , leading to a ﬁrst order transition even in the L - ensemble . For a nearly cylindrical section , like the tubular part of the membrane , the shape equations can be expanded in pow - ers of U ( Z ) = R ( Z ) − R 0 . After changing parameters [ ψ ( S ) , Z ( S ) ] → ψ ( Z ) , the expansion of Eq . ( 5 ) up to ﬁrst order in U ( Z ) and for p = 0 reduces to [ 10 ] R 40 U ′′′′ = − U . ( 10 ) Here the primes denote derivations with respect to Z . The solution of this equation is the sum of two exponentially de - caying oscillations from the two ends ( L lin and L ) of the tube : U ( Z ) R 0 = a 1 exp (cid:18) − Z − L lin √ 2 R 0 (cid:19) cos (cid:18) Z − L lin √ 2 R 0 + α 1 (cid:19) + a 2 exp (cid:18) − L − Z √ 2 R 0 (cid:19) cos (cid:18) L − Z √ 2 R 0 + α 2 (cid:19) , ( 11 ) where the integration constants converge to a 1 ≈ 0 . 746 , a 2 ≈ 0 . 726 , α 1 ≈ 0 . 347 , and α 2 ≈ 3 . 691 ( determined by numerical ﬁtting ) as the length of the tube increases . These oscillations can be seen in Fig . 2 as overshootings from both the base and the tip of the tube . They can be understood in - tuitively by noticing that the smaller ( larger ) mean curvature near the base ( tip ) makes the effect of the bending rigidity on the tube radius less ( more ) pronounced , leading to a smaller ( larger ) R . The expansion of Eq . ( 6 ) up to the ﬁrst non - vanishing order in U ( Z ) gives us the deviation of the force : f − f 0 f 0 = R 20 U ′ U ′′′ − 1 2 R 20 U ′′ 2 + 1 2 1 R 20 U 2 . ( 12 ) Plugging Eq . ( 11 ) into Eq . ( 12 ) yields f − f 0 f 0 = 2 a 1 a 2 exp (cid:18) − L tube √ 2 R 0 (cid:19) cos (cid:18) L tube √ 2 R 0 + α 1 + α 2 (cid:19) , ( 13 ) which is an exponentially decaying oscillation as a function of L tube . This explains the observed non - monotonic behavior of the f - L curves , and gives a very good ﬁt to the f - L tube curve ( Fig . 1b inset ) with the same values of a i and α i as Z / R 0 R / R 0 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 0 5 10 15 20 25 ρ / σ FIG . 2 : The shape of a tube magniﬁed in the radial direction ( solid line ) , and the surface energy density ( dashed line ) . determined above for the shape oscillations . In a different en - semble , Heinrich et al . [ 11 ] also observed similar oscillations for axially strained vesicles . The surface energy density ρ = ( κ / 2 ) ( 2 H ) 2 + σ of the membrane is plotted in Fig . 2 . It grows from σ to 2 σ as we enter the tube from the base , and diverges at the tip . Because at the tip the angle ψ is small again , Eq . ( 8 ) can be used to describe the surface there , leading to a logarithmic divergence of the mean curvature [ 10 , 12 ] . In experiments , bundles of tubes can often be observed [ 6 ] . To study the interaction between two tubes , let us start with a planar membrane that spans a ring and is pulled perpendicu - larly by two point forces ( f 1 and f 2 ) at a distance d . If d is large enough ( R 0 ≪ d ≪ R ring ) , both protrusions ( except for the vicinity of the points of pulling ) can be described by the leading logarithmic term of the linear approximation ( 9 ) . Their superposition can be used to calculate the d - dependence of the free energy of the membrane . Note that fL in Eq . ( 1 ) has to be replaced by f 1 L 1 + f 2 L 2 , where L 1 and L 2 are the sizes of the deformations . Straightforward calculation results in an attractive potential F ( d ) = const + 2 R 0 ln ( d ) f 1 f 2 / f 0 between the two deformations . The same attraction has been found between membrane - bound adhesion molecules [ 13 ] . For the attraction between two tubes replace both f 1 and f 2 by f 0 . To see what happens when two tubes get close , we per - formed numerical energy minimization with the S URFACE E VOLVER program [ 14 ] . We deﬁned the initial topology as a piece of membrane spanning a ring of radius 12 R 0 at Z = 0 , with two cylindrical protrusions in the positive Z direction . We applied zero curvature boundary condition at the ring and reﬂecting boundary condition at Z = 24 R 0 ( Fig . 3 ) . To make sure that the two tubes do not coalesce we placed a very nar - row ( ≪ R 0 ) cylindrical obstacle between the tubes , perpen - dicularly to them , and at a distance h from the ring ( not shown in Fig . 3 ) . The obstacle simply pinned down the middle of the membrane at Z = h . We then measured the pinning force f p ( exerted by the obstacle on the membrane ) as a function of h . Fig . 3 shows that f p is always negative ( i . e . , pushes the membrane ) , meaning that there is no energy barrier against 4 h / R 0 −f p / f 0 1 0 . 9 0 . 8 0 . 7 0 . 6 0 . 5 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 FIG . 3 : The pinning force f p as a function of h . It goes from − f 0 / 2 ( because if two tubes are far apart their attraction can be eliminated by a − f 0 / 2 point force applied halfway ) to − f 0 ( because for large h the junction is pulled by two tubes upward but by only one tube downward ) . The solid line is a ﬁt by an exponentially decaying os - cillation . coalescence , it occurs smoothly . This is consistent with the experiments of Evans et al . [ 4 ] . Tubes can be detached via ﬁssion and then transported in - dividually in the cell as long prolate - like vesicles ( keeping their original radius R 0 ) . Because of volume and area con - straints their energy contains only the bending term : F = R ( κ / 2 ) ( 2 H ) 2 d A . Although with such a high area - to - volume ratio the energetically most favorable shape is the stomato - cyte , these prolates are metastable [ 15 ] . They are also very ﬂexible . If we consider a prolate as a rod and bend it with a curvature C ( ≪ 1 / R 0 ) , its energy , for symmetry reasons , increases quadratically with C . This energy increase can be written as ( κ / 2 ) ( λC 2 ) 2 πR 0 L , where L is the length of the prolate , and the factor λ = (cid:10) sin 2 φ (cid:11) = 1 / 2 indicates that during the integration of the energy around a cross - section ( parametrized by φ ) , only the out - of - plane component of the bending counts . Thus , the bending stiffness of a prolate - like vesicle is κπR 0 , and its persistence length κπR 0 / ( k B T ) is in the order of a few hundred nanometers . Although these prolates are thicker than the microtubules , their persistence length is much closer to that of a DNA . This is because their wall is a two - dimensional ﬂuid . Due to this ﬂuidity they do not even resist twisting , which makes them ideal semiﬂexible ﬁlaments . We close this Letter by discussing some of the biological consequences of our theoretical results . The major biological relevance of the ﬁrst force peak of the f - L curves is that in order to form a tube , the motor proteins must be able to pro - vide a force that is 13 % larger than what is needed to pull a long tube . At a pulling force of f = f 0 the peak corresponds to a 2 . 1 κ ≈ 21 k B T high energy barrier , which is practically insurmountable for such a big and slow object as a growing tube . Thus , tube formation works on an all - or - nothing basis : motors can pull out tubes only if they are strong enough to overcome the major force peak . Although at the tip of the tubes the size of the lipids ( ∼ 0 . 5 nm ) represents a natural cutoff length - scale for the diver - gence of the energy density , it goes up to tens of σ . In terms of membrane rupture , the energy density acts as an effective sur - face tension , meaning that the most likely place for rupture to occur is the tip of the tubes . So if biological systems want to avoid rupture , they either have to protect the tips or distribute the pulling forces at larger areas . That could be achieved , e . g . , by utilizing cap proteins or lipid rafts . We have shown that without external pinning tubes coalesce smoothly . Thus , to explain bundle formation , other physical effects that could prevent the coalescence of tubes ( e . g . adhe - sion between the tubes and the cytoskeleton ) must be taken into account .
