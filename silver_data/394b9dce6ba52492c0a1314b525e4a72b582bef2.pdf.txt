BMC Nephrology Qualitative assessment of the patient experience of primary hyperoxaluria type 1 : an observational study David Danese 1 * , Diana Goss 2 , Carla Romano 2 and Catherine Gupta 2 Abstract Background Without effective intervention , primary hyperoxaluria type 1 ( PH1 ) causes oxalate - induced kidney damage , leading to end - stage kidney disease and serious complications throughout the body . Although PH1 car - ries a heavy burden that impacts quality of life , literature on the experiences of those living with PH1 and caring for patients with PH1 is limited . This study aimed to describe the diagnostic journey in PH1 and characterize patients’ and caregivers’ self - reported experiences throughout the disease course . Methods This was an observational study involving in - depth , semi - structured telephone interviews . Dominant trends were assessed using constant comparative analysis to identify themes in interviewees’ descriptions of their experiences . Individuals aged ≥ 12 years and caregivers of children aged 6 – 17 years with genetically confirmed PH1 were eligible . Informed consent / assent and ability to read and speak English were required . Results Interviewees ( 16 patients , 12 caregivers ) reported a prolonged diagnostic journey due to low disease aware - ness , among other factors . Upon diagnosis , PH1 was frequently symptomatic , typically involving kidney stone - related symptoms but also potentially symptoms arising beyond the kidneys . PH1 most commonly led to worry and social impairment in adolescents , impaired physical function in adults , and a range of impacts on caregivers . In late - stage disease , dialysis was the most burdensome aspect of living with PH1 ( due to time requirements , limitations from liv - ing with a catheter , etc . ) , and this burden was exacerbated by the COVID - 19 pandemic . Benefits desired from PH1 management included reductions in laboratory measures of oxalate burden , kidney stone and urination frequency , and oxalate - related skin ulcers . Conclusions PH1 greatly impacts patients’ and caregivers’ lives , primarily due to burdensome disease manifestations and associated emotional , physical , and practical impacts , as well as disease management challenges – particularly those related to dialysis in late - stage disease . Keywords Quality of Life , SARS - CoV - 2 , Hyperoxaluria , Primary , Caregivers , Kidney Failure , Chronic , Kidney Stones , Qualitative Research , Oxalosis Background Primary hyperoxalurias ( PH ) are a group of rare autoso - mal recessive genetic diseases characterized by oxalate overproduction in the liver [ 1 – 3 ] . Because the body relies on the kidneys to eliminate oxalate produced by the liver , PH results in excretion of excess oxalate by the kidneys , leading to formation of toxic calcium oxalate crystals in * Correspondence : David Danese ddanese @ alnylam . com 1 Alnylam Pharmaceuticals , 675 West Kendall St , Cambridge , MA 02142 , USA 2 Research Triangle Institute , Research Triangle Park , NC , USA Page 2 of 11 Danese et al . BMC Nephrology ( 2023 ) 24 : 319 the kidneys and urinary tract and , consequently , devel - opment of chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) and calcium oxalate kidney stones [ 1 , 2 ] . There are 3 known types of PH : PH1 , PH2 , and PH3 [ 1 , 2 ] . PH1 is the most common ( ~ 80 % of all PH ) and severe type [ 1 – 4 ] . In patients with PH1 who do not receive effective intervention , oxalate - induced kidney damage almost inevitably leads to end - stage kidney disease ( ESKD ) [ 1 , 5 ] . Kidney impairment and consequent decreases in urine output , resulting in incomplete clearance of oxalate from the body by the kid - neys , can in turn lead to accumulation of oxalate in the bloodstream , with potentially devastating complications affecting organs beyond the kidneys ( e . g . , bone fractures , vision loss , heart problems ) due to the ensuing deposi - tion of calcium oxalate crystals throughout the body [ 2 , 4 , 6 ] . PH1 is associated with early mortality due to ESKD and complications of systemic oxalosis ( i . e . , oxalate depo - sition throughout the body , beyond the kidneys ) [ 7 ] . PH1 has an estimated prevalence of 1 to 3 cases per million according to epidemiology data from Europe . Prevalence may be elevated in populations with increased rates of consanguinity ( i . e . , birth of children to parents who are related to one another ) and populations with pathogenic founder mutations ( i . e . , populations in which many individuals are descended from a single common ancestor who carried a PH1 - causing mutation ) [ 1 , 3 , 8 ] . Symptoms of PH1 typically first arise around 4 to 5 years of age [ 9 , 10 ] . Because of the rarity of PH1 and the potential non - specificity of disease symptoms , diagnostic delay is common ; median time from the first appearance of symptoms to diagnosis exceeds 5 years [ 11 , 12 ] . Up to 70 % of adults and more than 40 % of pediatric patients with PH1 have already reached ESKD by the time of diag - nosis [ 1 , 7 , 10 , 11 , 13 ] . PH1 carries a heavy acute symptom burden associated with kidney stones : excretion of blood in urine , difficult or painful urination , abdominal pain , urinary tract block - age , and recurrent urinary tract infections [ 2 ] . High rates of symptoms potentially associated with impacts of PH1 beyond the kidneys and urinary tract are also reported [ 8 ] . These symptoms are in addition to the potential CKD symptoms , such as impaired cognitive and physical abili - ties , sleep disturbance , and pain , that can occur in asso - ciation with PH1 [ 14 ] . Patients with PH1 in whom CKD has progressed to ESKD and / or who require dialysis may experience a further increase in symptom burden due to ESKD and dialysis ( e . g . , fatigue , difficulty sleeping , bone or joint pain , sexual dysfunction , itching , muscle cramps , dry mouth ) in addition to the potential future burden of liver - kidney transplantation , which is associated with sig - nificant risks of death and other complications [ 15 – 17 ] . Historically , PH1 management has mainly involved treatment with high - dose vitamin B 6 and / or other supportive measures ( increased fluid intake , use of oral citrate supplements ) aimed at creating unfavorable conditions for excess oxalate to combine with calcium to form calcium oxalate crystals , with these measures followed by dialysis and ultimately transplantation of the liver ( to remove the source of excess oxalate pro - duction ) and kidneys ( to replace kidney function lost to oxalate - induced kidney damage ) once late - stage CKD is reached [ 1 , 3 , 4 , 15 , 18 , 19 ] . In 2020 , lumasiran became the first PH1 treatment approved by the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) and the European Medi - cines Agency ( EMA ) [ 3 ] . Adults and pediatric patients receiving lumasiran experienced substantially reduced oxalate levels across all disease severity levels , includ - ing advanced cases requiring dialysis , in three Phase 3 clinical trials ; the most common adverse events related to lumasiran were mild , short - lived injection - site reac - tions [ 19 – 21 ] . Nedosiran , which in the Phase 3 PHYOX 2 trial demonstrated a significantly greater reduction in urinary oxalate versus placebo from Day 90 to Day 180 [ 22 ] , has since become the second FDA - approved PH1 treatment ; its indication is limited to patients 9 years of age and older with relatively preserved kidney func - tion . No other approved treatments are available . Other treatments under study include a pharmaceutical for - mulation of the bacterium Oxalobacter formigenes [ 23 ] , stiripentol , CHK - 336 , betaine , and oral enzyme therapies [ 3 , 15 ] . Qualitative research methods , including semi - struc - tured interviews featuring both open - ended and more targeted questions , are often recommended by the FDA to gain insights into patients’ experiences and elicit the factors important to patients in the context of new ther - apy development [ 24 , 25 ] . In addition , understanding how patients experience disease burden is critical for informing care decisions that best meet patients’ needs . This is particularly important in PH1 , given that care is evolving , new treatments are emerging , and treatment decisions are becoming more complex . Only one study has qualitatively examined patient and caregiver experiences in PH , spanning PH1 , PH2 , and PH3 [ 26 ] . We therefore aimed to conduct a study to describe patients’ and caregivers’ self - reported experi - ences in the specific setting of PH1 , with a unique focus on the diagnostic journey and on differences in experi - ence by disease stage and age . Regarding disease experi - ence , we aimed to gather information on the impacts of PH1 on patients and their caregivers specific to activities of daily living , social activities , physical and emotional well - being , and work / school ; explore patients’ and car - egivers’ experiences and expectations relating to man - agement of PH1 ; and describe the support and resources that these patients and caregivers access . Page 3 of 11 Danese et al . BMC Nephrology ( 2023 ) 24 : 319 Methods Study design In this observational study , experienced qualitative research staff conducted in - depth telephone interviews with patients diagnosed with PH1 or their caregiv - ers . To ensure consistent and accurate data capture , each 60 - min semi - structured interview was recorded and facilitated by 2 staff members : an interviewer led the discussion , and the second staff member captured detailed notes and ensured adherence to the interview guide . Participants were recruited through qualitative research partners Global Perspectives and Rare Patient Voice , and an institutional review board determined exemption status . Because the study took place during the COVID - 19 pandemic ( 17 June 2020 to 23 Febru - ary 2021 ) , the interviews also addressed the impact of COVID - 19 overall , and on living with PH1 specifically . Study population A screening tool confirmed participant eligibility and informed consent was provided . Study - eligible indi - viduals were patients aged 12 years and older and car - egivers of children aged 6 to 17 years with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of PH1 . Participants were required to provide informed consent / assent / parental permis - sion ( as applicable ) and be able to read and speak Eng - lish . The study protocol specified a recruitment target of 28 patients . Study variables and interview concepts Demographic data and other baseline characteris - tics were collected at screening . The interview discus - sion guide elicited descriptions of early symptoms that prompted efforts to seek medical care , and an overall summary ( from the patient or caregiver perspective , as applicable ) of symptoms experienced throughout the disease course , impacts related to those symptoms , experiences with the management of PH1 , treatment expectations , support sources , resources accessed , and future outlook . Analysis A constant comparative analysis method was employed to reveal dominant trends in interview data and thus identify themes or patterns in participants’ descriptions of their experiences and perceptions [ 27 ] . Specifically , interview transcripts and interviewer field notes were used to identify dominant trends within each recorded interview , and then each interview’s findings were com - pared with those of the other interviews to identify themes or patterns recurring across the interview sam - ple in terms of participants’ descriptions . According to the calculation method of Fugard and Potts [ 28 ] , the target study cohort size of 28 patients would provide 90 % power to detect any theme of interest in at least 1 interview if the true prevalence of the patient expe - rience captured by that theme was between 5 and 10 % in the underlying PH1 population represented by the study cohort . For analysis of baseline quantitative and categori - cal data , descriptive statistics were computed , quality checked , and summarized . Results Study population In total , 16 patients with PH1 ( 10 adults , 6 adolescents ) and 12 caregivers ( of children aged 6 – 16 years with PH1 ) were interviewed . Interviewees’ baseline demo - graphics and disease characteristics are presented in Table 1 . Pathway to diagnosis Average age at diagnosis of PH1 was 8 . 8 years ( range , pre - birth to 32 years ) , and average time from the first appear - ance of symptoms to PH1 diagnosis was 1 . 8 years ( range , 2 months to 10 years ) . Interviewees reported that symp - toms that led to diagnosis included kidney stones ( 96 % ) , pain associated with kidney stones ( 84 % ) , tiredness / fatigue ( 48 % ) , fever / chills during kidney stone episodes ( 40 % ) , painful urination due to kidney stones ( 40 % ) , fre - quent urge to urinate ( 40 % ) , and bed - wetting ( 36 % ) . “It was… since I was 9 months old , my kidneys failed . Then I had a kidney transplant when I was about 1 year old . I was misdiagnosed when I had the kidney transplant , and then they found out when I was 6 years old . ” ( adult patient ) “ [ O ] ne of the issues initially was bed wetting and initially his pediatrician chalked that up to the communication between the brain and the blad - der , the age of development . [ They thought it ] would eventually go away . ” ( caregiver ) Barriers to diagnosis noted by interviewees included problems with insurance coverage for PH1 genetic testing , lack of knowledge of PH1 by healthcare pro - viders , time to referral for a nephrologist , dismissal of symptoms by healthcare providers , and time to receive genetic testing results : “The doctors , my primary care and then my kidney doctor that I had , they had never even heard of it [ PH1 ] . ” ( adult patient ) Page 4 of 11 Danese et al . BMC Nephrology ( 2023 ) 24 : 319 PH1 symptoms following diagnosis Most patients ( 71 % ) were reported to have 1 to 4 ongo - ing PH1 symptoms that continued following diagnosis , the most common being kidney dysfunction ( Table 2 ) . Patients who experienced ongoing symptoms following diagnosis were reported to have kidney , skeletal ( with joint pain and swelling ) , heart , skin , and / or eye symptoms , as well as other nonspecific constitutional symptoms . When asked to report the most bothersome symptoms of PH1 , interviewees most frequently noted pain associated with kidney stones ( N = 11 ) and fatigue ( N = 6 ) ( Table 3 ) . “Kidney stones for sure . Just the pain . It was abso - lutely miserable . Sometimes I was mildly in pain , and sometimes I wanted to lie in the fetal position and cry . ” ( adult patient ) “ [ T ] he fatigue is a concern to me . Because he shouldn’t be that tired . ” ( caregiver ) Impacts of PH1 Adult patient interviewees more frequently reported impacts of PH1 in terms of physical activity / mobility ( 50 % ) and depression ( 40 % ) , whereas adolescent patient interviewees reported health - related worries ( 83 % ) and impacts on social functioning ( 83 % ) ( Table 4 ) . In addi - tion , 10 of the 12 caregiver interviewees reported 1 or more impacts on their own lives ; impacts on caregiv - ers included disturbed sleep , worry and fear for their children’s future , missing work , inability to care for self ( e . g . , hygiene / grooming , dealing with medical care , exercise ) , and impacts on daily activities ( e . g . , house cleaning ) . Interviewees were also asked about how the impact of PH1 evolved over time . In total , 10 interviewees said some impacts have become more challenging with time , such as disease management requirements ( e . g . , taking medication on time , drinking sufficient water ) ( N = 3 ) , scheduling doctor visits and routine testing Table 1 Interview participant and care recipient demographic characteristics a Interview participants are patients > 16 years of age and care providers for patients 6 – 16 years of age b In the case of caregiver interviewees , “patient” refers to the patient with PH1 who is being cared for by the interviewee c Includes 1 participant who reported previous experience with dialysis but , due to improvements in kidney function , has now been able to stop dialysis treatments .

Where now , if I miss a dose of my antirejection , it is a big deal . ” ( adult patient ) Study participants were also asked to describe the most bothersome and / or most difficult - to - manage impacts of PH1 . Impacts related to disease management require - ments ( e . g . , diet , fluid intake , dialysis ) ( N = 7 ) and social life impacts ( N = 7 ) were deemed the most bothersome by both patients and caregivers ( Table 5 ) . Patients and car - egivers reported that the impacts of disease management requirements ( N = 5 ) , disease impacts on social life ( N = 3 ) , and impacts on emotional / mental well - being ( N = 3 ) were the most difficult - to - manage impacts of PH1 ( Table 6 ) . Table 2 Symptoms of PH1 reported by patients after diagnosis Symptoms experienced by 1 patient only included swelling in fingers , inability to focus , headaches , feeling generally ill , skin discomfort / pain , palpitations , shortness of breath , fractures , and nausea IDI In - depth interview , PH1 Primary hyperoxaluria type 1 Blue columns = adult patient participants ; red columns = adolescent patient participants ; green columns = care provider participants Page 6 of 11 Danese et al . BMC Nephrology ( 2023 ) 24 : 319 Experiences related to the management of PH1 Study participants were asked about their experiences related to the management of PH1 , including COVID - 19 – related impacts on these experiences . Regard - ing specific disease management options , 10 patients were reported to have a history of transplant or dialy - sis : N = 6 ( as reported by 5 patient interviewees and 1 caregiver interviewee ) had undergone kidney and liver transplantation , and N = 4 ( as reported by 2 patient and 2 caregiver interviewees ) were on dialysis at the time of the interview , or sometime previously . Among patients with current ( N = 3 ) or past ( N = 1 ) dialysis , schedules ranged from 3 to 6 sessions per week lasting 3 to 4 . 5 h each . Patients described symptoms of fatigue , headache , and dizziness following dialysis ses - sions . Study participants also described practical limi - tations caused by the need to keep catheter access sites dry , and significant time commitments for sessions themselves and for travel to the dialysis site . Caregiver interviewees with children on dialysis described the impact of dialysis schedules on their lives , routines , and families . " Day starts off with dialysis ; get home in the after - noon . So because of her really full schedule with dialysis , she’s had to switch to homebound [ instruc - tional services ] for school . So a teacher comes 2 days a week for only 2 hours at a time . And before this , she was enrolled in a regular classroom with 20 other kids . And now it’s just her and the teacher at the dining room table . I know there’s only so much they can do with homeschool , but it’s definitely a reduced curriculum . And so sometimes we feel she’s missing out . " ( caregiver ) COVID - 19 – related impacts on the experience of dialy - sis were described as well ; the study findings suggest that the pandemic exacerbates the challenges of dialysis by increasing the duration and complexity of visits , making it more difficult for caregivers to accompany and support young patients during dialysis sessions . “My child is on dialysis , and she goes 6 days a week for treatments , so the process of getting checked - in and ready for dialysis is a lot different than it was a few months ago with two temperature checks . It’s like there’s a lot of checkpoints . When we first get there , we get our temperature checked . We get asked a whole bunch of questions . When we get to the renal floor , it’s kind of the same routine . ” ( caregiver ) Short - term impacts described in association with kid - ney / liver transplantation ( N = 6 ) included pain , physical limitations , missed school , and inability to spend time with friends in the period immediately following the procedure . Over the longer term , transplantation was described as having positive impacts on patients’ lives , including increased energy , a feeling of recovered health , the ability to stop dialysis , and cessation of kidney stones . Accompanying these positive impacts , however , were certain long - term concerns , including concerns over the need for “antirejection medications” ( and the need for tight adherence to the recommended dosing sched - ule for these medications ) following transplantation , as well as concerns over the potentially harmful effects of immune system suppression caused by these antirejec - tion medications . “Just taking medicine on time [ is ] tricky and mak - ing sure I drink a lot of water can be tricky . ” ( adult patient ) Some interviewees also described the potential need for and emotional and physical impact of additional transplantations ( e . g . , following failure of a transplanted organ ) in the future . " The first month or so [ post - transplantation ] , it’s just recovering . That’s always different . After that , I had way more energy , and it was good… I know some - day I’ll have to get a transplant again , hopefully not . That’d be awesome . Other than that , I know I’ll have to take medicine forever , but I feel like I have it under control . I think I can manage it . " ( adult patient ) Among patients with abnormal kidney function who had not undergone dialysis / transplantation ( N = 5 ; as reported by 3 patient interviewees and 2 caregiver inter - viewees ) , disease management involved high fluid intake / hyperhydration for all 5 . Similarly , among those with normal kidney function ( N = 13 ; as reported by 6 patient Table 3 Most bothersome symptom a Most bothersome symptoms for care recipients reported by caregivers .

Other disease management measures noted by these 13 interviewees included the use of vitamins ( with vitamin B 6 specifically reported for 7 patients ) , a low - sodium diet , and prescription medications to help pass kidney stones . “Every night I set out an amount of bottles . I have an app on my phone that can track my water . ” ( adoles - cent patient ) “She has one large , I want to say it’s a little over half a gallon water bottle that she fills up and she drinks that . Then she has her , sports drink that she tries to drink . She takes her vitamin drops , and she’ll put that in her water too and that helps . I know that she tries to go above . The doctor was recommending the eight to nine glasses , and I know that she goes…at least one to two bottles over . ” ( caregiver ) Expectations of treatment The majority of interviewees ( 75 % ) indicated that a treat - ment that could lower laboratory measures of oxalate burden would provide a meaningful benefit . “I think if a medication could help lower the oxalate somehow , whether it works by replacing that enzyme in the liver or if it helps your kid - neys get rid of it or whatever . If it somehow helps lower oxalate , even if it’s just a little bit , I think that that would be a wonderful change . ” ( adult patient ) Half of all interviewees also reported they would value treatments that reduced physical symptoms , for example , by reducing the frequency of kidney stones .

BMC Nephrology ( 2023 ) 24 : 319 Resources and looking ahead Adult patients’ and caregivers’ primary sources of sup - port include their doctor ( N = 3 ) , partner ( N = 3 ) , fam - ily / friends ( N = 6 ) , Facebook support groups ( N = 1 ) , church ( N = 1 ) , and therapist ( N = 1 ) . Other sources of support for patients and caregivers included online resources , nutritionists / dieticians , support groups through local hospitals , and child psychologists . Fourteen partici - pants reported having connections with other individuals / families affected by PH1 . Participants reported that support could be improved through enhanced training and awareness among med - ical professionals , increased access to support groups , development of targeted disease information / resources based on patient characteristics ( e . g . , gender , age ) , more information on financial resources and dealing with insurance providers , and more drug development / clinical trials to provide other treatment options . Discussion In broad agreement with findings from the study by Lawrence and Wattenberg across all types of PH [ 26 ] , the current study found that PH1 substantially impacts physical and emotional health [ 26 ] . The current study also expands on such previous work by focusing on the experience of patients with PH1 specifically , and by gath - ering data on the diagnostic journey and elucidating dif - ferences in experiences by disease stage and age . The results of the current study corroborate the well documented role of kidney stones and related symp - toms in triggering diagnosis of PH1 [ 10 ] , as well as the common occurrence of delays in diagnosis following onset of clinical manifestations [ 10 ] . From patients’ and caregivers’ perspectives , issues with insurance coverage for genetic testing , limited awareness of PH1 by health - care providers , and long wait times for referral to a neph - rologist were key factors contributing to these delays . Post diagnosis , nearly all patients experienced symp - toms of PH1 . Kidney - related symptoms were common , but a number of patients also reported symptoms beyond the kidneys , such as fatigue , bone pain , and vision changes . The practical impacts of these symptoms , and of the disease more broadly , appeared to differ according to the age of the patient . Adolescents frequently reported psychological and / or social impacts ( worry and impaired social functioning ) , whereas adults reported impacts on physical functioning and emotional well - being ( depres - sion ) . The practical impacts of PH1 extended to caregiv - ers , who reported issues ranging from sleep disturbance to impairment in emotional well - being , occupational outcomes , and self - care / activities of daily living . Regarding PH1 management , there is a heavy burden imposed by the need for dialysis in late - stage PH1 . Inter - viewees discussed how dialysis is all - consuming due to the required travel and chair time , leading to social , edu - cational , and occupational limitations . Interviewees also reported that catheters impose practical restrictions ( e . g . , the need to keep the access site dry complicates daily activities such as showering ) . These impacts are in addi - tion to the impacts of the dialysis procedure itself , which often produces side effects such as fatigue , headache , and dizziness . Finally , interviewees noted that the challenges of dialysis are exacerbated by the COVID - 19 pandemic , which further increases the duration and complexity of visits and makes it more difficult for caregivers to accom - pany and support young patients .

" “ If I got less kidney stones . ” “We’re definitely interested for any medications that can make her , help her lead a normal life without having , to have such frequent urination…” “ I would say reduce as many symptoms [ ulcers ] as possible . ” Prevent need for dialysis or kidney / liver transplantations N = 6 ; 21 % " There is no cure , but I think if you can lessen the chances of having to be put on dialysis or get a transplant , I think that that is a very successful medication that I would love to have had . " Reduce need for increased fluid intake N = 5 ; 18 % " If there was any way that it could reduce the amount of water they have to drink . Water is a four - letter word in our house , and it’s not fun . And trying to get a child to drink that much water every single day is so hard . " Allow for more flexibility in diet N = 3 ; 11 % Reduce emotional impacts N = 3 ; 11 % " I think those emotional impacts would come as a result of the other symptoms being lessened , let’s say fatigue or those aches and pains which correlate in their own way emotionally as a result of how extreme is the fatigue , how extreme is the pain . " Page 10 of 11 Danese et al . BMC Nephrology ( 2023 ) 24 : 319 Our study provides unique insight into the treatment benefits desired by patients and caregivers . Improve - ment in laboratory measures of oxalate burden is highly valued by study participants . Oxalate is recognized as the starting point from which clinical burden origi - nates , and patients and caregivers communicated that improvement in indicators of oxalate burden would thus have an important impact on their emotional well - being . The perceived value of reductions in oxa - late burden is strongly linked to participants’ desire for a treatment that halts disease progression and prevents the need for dialysis . Reduction in physical symptoms ( e . g . , kidney stone events , skin ulcers , and frequent uri - nation ) is the next most highly valued treatment benefit , representing significant alleviation of the physical bur - den of PH1 . We used a robust qualitative methodology to describe the experience of patients living with PH1 and their car - egivers . Information was collected directly from patients and caregivers , and interviews were recorded , tran - scribed verbatim , and analyzed by highly experienced qualitative researchers . To facilitate comparability across interviews with different study participants , a compre - hensive semi - structured guide was used in conducting all interviews . The use of a robust , systematic analysis method to extract meaning from unstructured qualitative data provided key insights and allowed meaningful inter - pretation of the study findings . This study was limited by the relatively small sample size , as is frequently the case with rare diseases . In addi - tion , recall challenges are a limitation of studies that involve self - reporting . To help limit bias and reduce the interviewer’s influence on response , interviews cen - tered on open - ended questions . The study is also sub - ject to the inherent limitations of qualitative analysis , for example , inability to draw conclusions about sta - tistical relevance and limited generalizability of find - ings . Finally , it should be noted that study interviews were conducted between June 2020 and February 2021 , with most completed before FDA approval of lumasiran in November 2020 , and the study protocol excluded patients who had received an experimental therapy at any point in the 90 days before eligibility screening . Therefore , although patients were not asked whether they had experience with lumasiran or an experimental PH1 therapy , the findings reported here can be viewed as being reflective of patients’ experience with PH1 in the context of older , historical disease management interventions rather than newer therapies . Overall , the findings of this study afford clinicians and decision - makers insights into the humanistic bur - den of PH1 in terms of physical , emotional , and prac - tical impacts as described by affected individuals and their caregivers . These results may offer healthcare providers an increased understanding and awareness of PH1 and the burden experienced by both patients and caregivers . The study findings , combined with existing data on the burden of PH1 , may also help inform clini - cal decision - making related to diagnosis and treatment and ensure patients’ needs are considered in the con - text of PH1 management [ 24 ] .
