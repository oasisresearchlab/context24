Acrosome biogenesis requires the dynamic cytoskeletal 30 shuttling of vesicles towards nascent acrosome which is regulated by a series of accessory 31 proteins . However , much remains unknown about the molecular basis underlying this 32 process . Here , we generated Ssh2 knock - out ( KO ) mice and show that Slingshot 33 phosphatase 2 ( SSH2 ) , a regulator of actin remodeling , is essential for acrosome 34 biogenesis and male fertility . In Ssh2 KO males , spermatogenesis was arrested at the early 35 spermatid stage with enhanced germ cell apoptosis and the impaired acrosome biogenesis 36 was characterized by defective transport / fusion of proacrosomal vesicles . Moreover , 37 disorganized F - actin structures accompanied by excessive phosphorylation of COFILIN 38 were observed in testes of Ssh2 KO mice . Collectively , our data reveal a modulatory role 39 for SSH2 in acrosome biogenesis through COFILIN - mediated actin remodeling and the 40 indispensability of this phosphatase in male fertility in mice . 41 Introduction 42 The most common cause of non - obstructive azoospermia is impaired spermatogenesis 43 ( i . e . , the production of mature spermatozoa ) , which is behind about 15 % of infertility 44 cases in men ( Agarwal et al . , 2021 ) . In basic studies of mice , spermatogenesis is routinely 45 subdivided into 12 stages ( Meistrich & Hess , 2013 ; Oakberg , 1956 ) , and the process 46 2 through which post - meiotic spermatids develop into mature spermatozoa is termed 47 “spermiogenesis” ( Bao & Bedford , 2016 ) , marked by a series of cellular remodeling 48 events that includes the biogenesis of the acrosome – an acidic , membranous organelle 49 positioned over the anterior part of the sperm nucleus that functions in the fertilization of 50 the egg ( Moreno & Alvarado , 2006 ) . The transformation of round spermatids involves the 51 cytoskeletal system , which shuttles proteins and vesicles to the nascent acrosome via 52 dynamic cytoskeletal remodeling orchestrated by various accessory proteins such as the 53 actin - binding protein PROFILIN - 3 ( Umer et al . , 2021 ) . 54 According to the classical morphological descriptions of acrosome biogenesis that 55 follows four sequential phases ( the Golgi phase , cap phase , acrosome phase , and 56 maturation phase ) ( Clermont & Leblond , 1955 ) , the nascent acrosome is sequentially 57 assembled from so - called proacrosomal vesicles that originate from the Golgi apparatus 58 through the biosynthetic pathway ( Khawar , Gao , & Li , 2019 ) . However , recent 59 experimental findings have implicated some other cellular components ( e . g . the endocytic 60 machinery ) in vesicular trafficking towards the growing acrosome ( Berruti & Paiardi , 61 2015 ; Y . C . Li et al . , 2006 ) , supporting the existence of extra - Golgi supply of 62 proacrosomal vesicles . It is important to note that the role of filamentous actin ( F - actin ) as 63 a cytoskeletal transport platform for proacrosomal vesicles has been documented 64 ( Kierszenbaum , Rivkin , & Tres , 2003b ) . In addition , several Golgi - associated proteins are 65 known to function in the transport / fusion of proacrosomal vesicles , including GOPC ( Yao 66 et al . , 2002 ) , PICK1 ( Xiao et al . , 2009 ) and GM130 ( Han et al . , 2017 ) . More recently , the 67 contribution of autophagic machinery in Golgi - derived proacrosomal vesicle trafficking 68 has been suggested by findings in germ cell - specific Atg7 - KO ( H . Wang et al . , 2014 ) and 69 Sirt1 - KO ( C . Liu et al . , 2017 ) mouse models , offering new insights into the molecular 70 mechanisms through which the acrosome develops . 71 As an actin - binding protein , COFILIN is widely known for its cutting and 72 depolymerizing functions that promote the subsequent remodeling of actin filaments 73 ( Wioland et al . , 2017 ) , which is required for many actin - driven possesses such as mitosis 74 ( Amano , Kaji , Ohashi , & Mizuno , 2002 ) and organelle trafficking ( Cichon et al . , 2012 ) . 75 Intriguingly , COFILIN was also found to stimulate actin nucleation at a high 76 COFILIN / actin concentration ratio , which in turn favors actin filament assembly 77 ( Andrianantoandro & Pollard , 2006 ) . It follows that the complex modulation of COFILIN 78 activity , consisting of post - translational modifications , protein binding , and redox 79 reactions ( Namme , Bepari , & Takebayashi , 2021 ) , enables the proper rearrangement of F - 80 actin organization in response to various extracellular stimuli . Among these regulatory 81 mechanisms , the phosphorylation / dephosphorylation at the Ser - 3 residue stands out as the 82 most crucial . Phosphorylation - mediated inactivation by LIM domain kinases ( LIMKs ) 83 prevents COFILIN ' s actin remodeling functions ( Arber et al . , 1998 ) , whereas activating 84 dephosphorylation of COFILIN is catalyzed by phosphatases such as chronophin ( Gohla , 85 Birkenfeld , & Bokoch , 2005 ) and the Slingshot ( SSH ) family of proteins ( Niwa , Nagata - 86 Ohashi , Takeichi , Mizuno , & Uemura , 2002 ) . A previous study with respect to mouse 87 reproduction demonstrated that impaired COFILIN phosphorylation results in increased 88 germ cell apoptosis in murine testes ( Takahashi , Koshimizu , Miyazaki , & Nakamura , 89 2002 ) , implicating COFILIN phospho - regulation in the progression of spermatogenesis . 90 The ssh gene was originally identified in Drosophila mutants with the bifurcation 91 phenotype of bristles and hairs ( Niwa et al . , 2002 ) , and the mammalian homologs encode 92 a set of COFILIN phosphatases , namely the SSH phosphatases . Some biological relevance 93 of SSHs has been revealed , especially the most well - characterized isoform SSH1 ( Bielig 94 et al . , 2014 ) , while much less is known about SSH2 other than its role as a regulator of 95 actin remodeling during neutrophil chemotaxis ( Xu et al . , 2015 ) . According to a gene - 96 3 expression study focusing on the SSHs , relatively higher expression of SSH2 was 97 observed in testes compared to other organs in mice ( Ohta et al . , 2003 ) . Moreover , in the 98 light of a recent proteomic study which is aiming at the prediction of meiosis - essential 99 genes , SSH2 exhibited increasing protein abundance changes with the proceeding of 100 murine spermatogenesis ( Fang et al . , 2021 ) , illustrating its potential role in male germ cell 101 development . By generating mice carrying targeted knockout ( KO ) of Ssh2 , we found that 102 SSH2 is an activator of COFILIN - mediated actin cytoskeleton remodeling and is essential 103 for proper acrosome biogenesis during spermatogenesis and thus male fertility . The 104 impaired acrosome biogenesis in Ssh2 KO mice is likely a consequence of abnormal 105 vesicular trafficking / fusion that can be attributed to disrupted F - actin remodeling . 106 Materials and Methods 107 Animals 108 The mouse Ssh2 gene ( Ensembl : ENSMUSG00000037926 ) is 243 . 93 kb and is located on 109 chromosome 11 , and 15 exons have been identified . The CRISPR / Cas9 genome editing 110 system ( Cyagen Biosciences , Suzhou , China ) was used to generate Ssh2 KO mice in the 111 C57BL / 6J background . Briefly , single guide RNAs ( sgRNAs ) targeting the mouse Ssh2 112 gene were co - injected with the Cas9 mRNA into fertilized mouse eggs , resulting in the 113 deletion of the genomic DNA segment harboring exon 8 of Ssh2 . Founder mice were 114 identified by PCR followed by sequence analysis to confirm the deletion , and these mice 115 were crossed with wildtype ( WT ) mice to test germline transmission and F1 animal 116 generation . All animal - breeding work was carried out at the Laboratory Animal Center of 117 Shandong University where the mice were housed under controlled environmental 118 conditions with free access to pathogen - free water and food . Mice were maintained and 119 collected for experiments according to protocols approved by the Animal Ethics 120 Committee of the School of Medicine , Shandong University . All animal care protocols in 121 this study were reviewed and approved by the Animal Use Committee of the School of 122 Medicine , Shandong University . 123 Genotyping 124 Genomic DNA extracted from mouse tail tips ( H . Liu et al . , 2019 ) was subjected to PCR 125 performed in a thermal cycler ( T100 , Bio - Rad Laboratories , Hercules , CA , USA ) . The 126 WT and Ssh2 KO alleles were assayed by primers : 5’ - TCC TTG CCT TGA GAA TTC 127 AAG CAA G - 3’ ( forward ) and 5’ - TGA TAT GGT TAG TCC ATT GTG CCC A - 3’ 128 ( reverse ) . The PCR conditions were as follows : 94°C for 3 min ; 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 129 sec , 66 °C for 35 sec , and 72 °C for 35 sec ; and 72 °C for 5 min . The PCR products were 130 assessed on 2 % agarose gels . 131 Antibodies and reagents 132 The rabbit anti - SSH2 polyclonal antibody against amino acids 1 , 295 – 1 , 423 of the mouse 133 SSH2 protein was custom - generated by Dia - an Biological Technology Incorporation 134 ( Wuhan , China ) as previously described ( M .

HRP - conjugated Affinipure goat anti - mouse and anti - rabbit IgG 151 ( H + L ) ( SA00001 - 1 / SA00001 - 2 , Proteintech ) were used as the secondary antibodies for 152 western blotting . The antibodies for immunofluorescent staining were mouse anti - p - 153 COFILIN monoclonal antibody ( 1 : 100 dilution , sc - 271921 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , 154 mouse anti - GM130 monoclonal antibody ( 1 : 100 dilution , 610822 , BD Biosciences , San 155 Jose , CA , USA ) , rabbit anti - GOPC polyclonal antibody ( 1 : 100 dilution , ab37036 , Abcam , 156 Cambridge , UK ) , rabbit anti - LC3 polyclonal antibody ( 1 : 200 dilution , 4108 , Cell 157 Signaling Technology ) , rabbit anti - SYCP1 polyclonal antibody ( 1 : 500 dilution , ab15090 , 158 Abcam ) , and mouse anti - SYCP3 monoclonal antibody ( 1 : 200 dilution , ab97672 , Abcam ) . 159 The secondary antibodies used for immunofluorescent staining were Alexa Fluor 488 / 594 - 160 conjugated goat anti - rabbit IgG ( H + L ) ( A - 11008 / A - 11012 , Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , 161 USA ) and goat anti - mouse IgG H & L ( Alexa Fluor 488 / 594 ) ( ab150117 / ab150120 , 162 Abcam ) . Rhodamine phalloidin was used to visualize F - actin ( R415 , Invitrogen ) , and 163 Alexa Fluor 488 - conjugated lectin PNA from Arachis hypogaea was used to visualize 164 acrosomes ( L21409 , Invitrogen ) . 165 In vivo fertility assessment 166 For fertility analysis , each adult male ( n = 3 , 8 – 10 weeks old ) of the different genotypes 167 was mated with two or three age - matched C57BL / 6J female mice for 3 months . Females 168 were checked for the presence of vaginal plugs . The number of live - born pups in each 169 cage was counted individually . 170 Tissue collection , histological analysis , and immunofluorescence 171 For histological examination , at least three adult mice for each genotype were analyzed . 172 Testes and caudal epididymides were dissected immediately following euthanasia , fixed in 173 Bouin’s solution ( HT1013 , Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO , USA ) for 16 – 24 h at room 174 temperature , dehydrated in an ethanol series ( 70 % , 85 % , 90 % , 95 % , and absolute 175 ethanol ) , cleared in xylene , and embedded in paraffin . For immunofluorescent staining , 176 testes and epididymides were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA , P1110 , Solarbio , 177 Beijing , China ) overnight at 4°C , dehydrated , cleared , and embedded . The tissues were 178 then cut into 5 μm sections using a microtome ( HistoCore BIOCUT , Leica Biosystems , 179 Nussloch , Germany ) and coated onto glass slides . Following drying at 60°C for 1 h , the 180 sections were deparaffinized in xylene , hydrated by a graded alcohol series , and stained 181 with hematoxylin for histological analysis or stained with periodic acid Schiff ( PAS ) - 182 hematoxylin ( ab150680 , Abcam ) for determining the seminiferous epithelia cycle stages . 183 For TUNEL staining , we followed the manufacturer’s instructions ( KeyGen Biotech , 184 Nanjing , China ) . Images were collected under a microscope with a coupled camera device 185 ( BX53 , Olympus , Tokyo , Japan ) . For immunostaining , deparaffinized sections were 186 hydrated , immersed in sodium citrate buffer ( pH 6 . 0 ) and heated for 15 min in a boiling 187 water bath for antigen retrieval . After permeabilization with PBS containing 0 . 3 % Triton 188 X - 100 and blocking with 5 % bovine serum albumin , the slides were incubated with 189 primary antibodies overnight at 4°C . Then the sections were rinsed in PBS and incubated 190 with appropriate FITC - conjugated secondary antibodies and / or Alexa Fluor 488 - 191 5 conjugated PNA / rhodamine phalloidin for 60 min at room temperature . Mounting medium 192 with DAPI ( ab104139 , Abcam ) was used to visualize the nucleus and to mount the slides . 193 Immunostaining was also conducted on cryosections that were prepared with the 194 following procedure . Fresh tissues were fixed in 4 % PFA for 12 – 24 h at 4°C , dehydrated 195 in 20 % sucrose ( in 1× PBS ) for 2 – 3 h followed by 30 % sucrose ( in 1× PBS ) overnight at 196 4°C , embedded in OCT , and cut into cryosections at 8 μm thickness using a cryotome 197 ( CM1950 , Leica Biosystems ) . Once sectioned , the samples were fixed on the slides with 198 4 % PFA for 10 – 15 min at room temperature and washed three times with PBS . 199 Subsequent steps were performed in the same way as for staining paraffin sections . 200 Sperm count 201 Mice epididymal sperm were released into PBS through multiple incisions of the cauda 202 followed by incubation for 30 – 60 min at 37°C under 5 % CO 2 . The living sperm was then 203 diluted in PBS at 1 : 50 and transferred to a hemocytometer for counting . For all 204 experiments , adult males 2 – 6 months of age were used . 205 Protein extraction and western blot analysis 206 Testes from adult mice were cut into ~ 20 mg pieces and transferred into ~ 200 μl pre - 207 cooled denaturing buffer from the Minute Total Protein Extraction Kit ( SD - 001 , Invent 208 Biotech , Plymouth , MN , USA ) containing protease inhibitors ( CO - RO , Roche , 209 Indianapolis , IN , USA ) and phosphatase inhibitors ( PHOSS - RO , Roche ) . Protein 210 extraction was performed with the Minute Total Protein Extraction Kit following the 211 manufacturer’s instructions . In order to load equal amounts of protein , the protein 212 concentration in the supernatant was measured using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit 213 ( 23225 , Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA , USA ) . After diluting with loading 214 buffer and boiling for 10 min at 95°C , an aliquot of 20 mg protein lysate per sample was 215 resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis , transferred to 216 polyvinylidene fluoride membranes , blocked with noise - cancelling reagents 217 ( WBAVDCH01 , Millipore , Burlington , MA , USA ) , and immunoblotted with the 218 appropriate primary antibodies . The membranes were then incubated with HRP - 219 conjugated secondary antibodies followed by immunodetection using a 220 chemiluminescence imaging system ( 5200 , Tanon Technology , Shanghai , China ) . 221 Surface chromosome spreading 222 Chromosome spread analysis was conducted with the drying - down technique as 223 previously described ( Peters , Plug , van Vugt , & de Boer , 1997 ) . Briefly , spermatocytes 224 from hypotonicity - treated testicular tubules were suspended in 0 . 1 M sucrose , spread on 225 glass slides , and immersed in PFA solution containing 0 . 15 % Triton X - 100 . Subsequent 226 immunolabeling of spermatocyte nuclei using antibodies against SYCP1 and SYCP3 was 227 performed according to the protocol for immunofluorescent staining of cryosections . 228 Isolation of spermatogenic cells and fluorescence - activated cell sorting ( FACS ) 229 Spermatogenic cells were isolated from the testes of 8 - week - old mice and subsequently 230 subjected to flow cytometry and fluorescence - activated cell sorting ( FACS ) for DNA 231 ploidy analysis . In brief , testes collected from 8 - week - old mice were decapsulated and 232 washed in pre - chilled PBS three times . After carefully cutting , pieces of the seminiferous 233 tubules were transferred into PBS containing 120 U / ml collagenase I ( 17018029 , Gibco , 234 Carlsbad , CA , USA ) for a 5 min incubation at 32°C . To obtain cell suspensions , the 235 tubular pieces were incubated in 0 . 25 % trypsin ( 25200056 , Gibco ) containing 1 mg / ml 236 DNase I ( 18047019 , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) at 32°C for 8 min with gentle pipetting . 237 6 Cold DMEM containing 5 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS , 10091155 , Gibco ) was added to 238 stop the digestion . The spermatogenic cells were collected from the cell suspension after 239 filtration through PBS - saturated 70 μm cell filters followed by centrifugation at 4°C ( 500 240 × g for 5 min ) . After removal of the supernatant , the cells were resuspended in 1 ml 241 DMEM containing 2 μl Hoechst 33342 ( 62249 , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) , 2 μl Zombie 242 Aqua dye ( 423101 , BioLegend , San Diego , CA , USA ) , and 5 μl DNase I and subjected to 243 flow cytometry . For FACS , the cell suspension was further rotated at a speed of 10 244 rpm / min for 20 min at 32°C and centrifuged for 5 min at 4°C . Finally , the cells prepared 245 for sorting were resuspended and cell populations were collected based on their 246 fluorescent label with Hoechst 33342 staining using FACS . 247 Electron microscopy 248 For transmission electron microscopy , testes collected from adult mice were cut into 1 – 2 249 mm 3 pieces and fixed in 2 . 5 % glutaraldehyde in 0 . 1 M cacodylate buffer ( pH 7 . 4 ) at 4°C 250 overnight . After washing in 0 . 1 M cacodylate buffer three times , the samples were 251 incubated in 1 % osmium tetroxide at room temperature for 1 h . The samples were then 252 washed with ultrafiltered water and stained in 2 % uranyl acetate for 30 min . Subsequent 253 dehydration was done through consecutive incubation in graded ethanol series ( 50 % , 70 % , 254 90 % , and absolute ethanol ) and an acetone bath . After dehydration , samples were 255 sequentially incubated in Embed - 812 resin : acetone mixtures at 1 : 1 and 3 : 1 for 2 h each 256 and in 100 % Embed - 812 resin for 3 – 4 h , all at room temperature . The samples were then 257 orientated and embedded with fresh resin at 37°C . Tissue blocks were cut on an 258 ultramicrotome ( UC7 , Leica Biosystems ) to yield 80 nm ultrathin sections , and these were 259 subsequently contrasted with uranyl acetate and lead citrate . The sections were then 260 observed and imaged using a transmission electron microscope operating at 120 kV ( JEM - 261 1400 , JEOL , Pleasanton , CA , USA ) . 262 Mouse seminiferous tubule squashes 263 Seminiferous tubule squash slides were prepared as described previously ( Wellard , 264 Hopkins , & Jordan , 2018 ) with minor modifications . Specimens of testes were removed 265 from adult mice and washed with PBS . The testicular tunica albuginea was torn and the 266 seminiferous tubules were released , collected , and fixed with 2 ml fixing solution for 5 267 min at room temperature in a 35 mm Petri dish . After washing twice with PBS , the 268 seminiferous tubules were cut into small pieces ( about 10 – 20 mm in length ) that were 269 subsequently transferred to the prepared glass slides containing 100 µl fixing / lysis 270 solution . Coverslips were then applied to cover the glass slides and were compressed 271 tightly for 20 seconds . After squashing , the glass slides were immediately frozen in liquid 272 N 2 for 15 sec and stored at – 80°C . To perform immunolabeling on the squash slides , the 273 coverslips were first removed after rewarming . The slides were immersed in PBS and 274 washed three times . The subsequent steps were similar to the procedure for 275 immunofluorescent staining of cryosections . 276 Imaging 277 Immunolabeled slides , including paraffin - sections , cryosections , squash slides , and 278 chromosome spreads , were imaged by confocal microscopy ( Dragonfly Spinning Disc 279 confocal microscope driven by Fusion Software , Andor Technology , Belfast , UK ) . 280 Projection images were then processed and analyzed using Bitplane Imaris ( version 9 . 7 ) 281 software . The histological and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase - dUTP nick - end 282 labeling ( TUNEL ) - stained samples were imaged using an epifluorescence microscope 283 7 ( BX52 , Olympus ) equipped with a digital camera ( DP80 , Olympus ) and processed using 284 cellSens Standard ( Olympus ) software packages . 285 Statistical analysis 286 Statistical analyses were conducted with SPSS software ( version 22 . 0 , IBM Corporation , 287 Armonk , NY , USA ) . All data are presented as the mean ± SEM , as indicated in the figure 288 legends . The statistical significance of the difference between the mean values for the 289 various genotypes was determined by Welch’s t - test with a paired two - tailed distribution . 290 The data were considered significant when the P - value was less than 0 . 05 . 291 Results 292 Ssh2 is essential for male fertility 293 To explore the in vivo functions of SSH2 , we generated mice with Ssh2 KO lacking exon 294 8 using CRISPR / Cas9 genome editing ( Figure 1A ) . We validated the Ssh2 KO in mice 295 using PCR of tail - derived genomic DNA ( supplementary Figure S1 ) and western blotting 296 of whole testicular lysates . SSH2 was immunodetected in the testes of wild - type ( WT ) 297 mice but was absent in the Ssh2 KO samples ( Figure 1B ) . Ssh2 KO male mice were found 298 to be completely infertile ( Figure 1C ) . Six mice of each genotype were assessed for 299 breeding over a 2 - month period , while no pups were obtained when adult Ssh2 KO males 300 mated with 8 - week - old WT fertile females . We detected no differences in the size of 301 testis , body weight , testis weight , or testis - to - body weight ratio in Ssh2 KO male mice 302 compared to their WT littermates ( Figure 1D - G ) . 303 Histological examination of WT and Ssh2 KO testes and epididymides by hematoxylin 304 staining revealed impaired spermatogenesis in Ssh2 KO males , with no mature 305 spermatozoa observed in the epididymal lumen of Ssh2 KO mice ( Figure 1H ) , which was 306 confirmed by the sperm count in the cauda epididymis ( Figure 1I ) . The seminiferous 307 tubules of WT testes were full of spermatogenic cells and contained a basal population of 308 spermatogonia , spermatocytes , and spermatids . In contrast , almost no elongating or 309 elongated spermatids were observed in the testes of Ssh2 KO males ; instead , round 310 spermatids were found to aggregate to form giant multinucleated cells that were then 311 verified to be spermatid clusters by FACS assessment ( Figure 1H , supplementary Figure 312 S2 ) . Thus , we deduced from these findings that Ssh2 is essential for male fertility . 313 Ssh2 KO mice exhibit spermatogenic arrest at the early spermatid stage and display 314 aberrantly high germ - cell apoptosis 315 To determine the time point of onset of spermatogenic arrest in Ssh2 KO males , we first 316 analyzed spermatocyte development by examining chromosomal synapsis during meiotic 317 progression in chromosome spreads from 3 - week - old testes of WT and Ssh2 KO mice . By 318 immunofluorescence co - staining of synaptonemal complex protein 1 ( SYCP1 ) and SYCP3 319 in the nuclei of spermatocyte spreads – which comprise the central and lateral elements of 320 the synaptonemal complex , respectively ( de Vries et al . , 2005 ; Yuan et al . , 2000 ) – we 321 found no obvious differences in their distribution patterns in various stages of meiotic 322 prophase , indicating that the prophase I process was successfully completed in WT and 323 Ssh2 KO mice ( supplementary Figure S3 ) . 324 We then performed detailed histological analysis by hematoxylin staining of testicular 325 sections from WT and Ssh2 KO males at various developmental stages . Testes collected 326 from Ssh2 KO mice at postnatal day ( PD ) 7 and PD14 were indistinguishable from those of 327 WT mice . The most advanced cells in WT testes were elongating spermatids at PD28 , and 328 none of these were present in Ssh2 KO testes . Round spermatid clusters were first 329 observed in Ssh2 KO tubules at PD28 , and these accumulated from PD35 to PD60 . We 330 8 next examined PD35 testes , and histological images showed that the Ssh2 KO tubules 331 were devoid of elongated spermatids ( supplementary Figure S4 ) . 332 To determine at which stage of spermatogenesis the developmental defects occurred , 333 sections of WT and Ssh2 KO testes were stained with hematoxylin and PAS , which labels 334 acrosomal glycoproteins , and we observed that spermatogenesis of Ssh2 KO mice was 335 arrested at stage Ⅱ - Ⅲ ( Figure 2A ) . Spermatids at various steps of spermiogenesis were 336 observed in WT seminiferous tubules , whereas only step 1 – 3 round spermatids were 337 present in Ssh2 KO tubules , indicating spermiogenic failure in these mice . We also 338 detected round spermatids with malformed acrosomal structures in Ssh2 KO testes , which 339 suggests that the acrosome formation was also affected . Furthermore , clustered round 340 spermatids and apoptotic - like germ cells exhibiting small hyperchromatic nuclei and 341 polynuclear structures , which are known indicators of apoptosis ( Catalano - Iniesta et al . , 342 2019 ) , were observed in Ssh2 KO tubules ( Figure 2A ) . 343 We then conducted a TUNEL assay to identify apoptotic cells in the testes and 344 epididymides of WT and Ssh2 KO mice . The counts of TUNEL - positive cells were 345 significantly increased in the Ssh2 KO seminiferous tubules which were observed 346 primarily as apoptotic spermatids , as indicated by the nuclear morphology and location 347 within spermatogenic epithelium ( Figure 2B , Figure 2C ) . Similarly , we found large 348 numbers of isolated apoptotic spermatids in the lumen of epididymal ducts of Ssh2 KO 349 mice ( Figure 2B , Figure 2D ) . To understand the potential mechanism behind the enhanced 350 germ cell apoptosis elicited by Ssh2 KO , we estimated the expression levels of several 351 apoptotic signaling proteins including Caspase - 3 with BCL - 2 , BAX and BAD , which are 352 well - known as Bcl - 2 family members involved in Caspase - 3 activation ( Gu et al . , 2021 ) . 353 As demonstrated by western blotting , in comparison with that of WT mice , remarkably 354 elevated protein levels of pro - apoptotic BAX , BAD , Caspase - 3 and cleaved Caspase - 3 355 accompanied by relative decreased protein levels of anti - apoptotic BCL - 2 proteins were 356 detected in the testicular lysates of Ssh2 KO mice ( Figure 2E ) , suggesting the induction of 357 Caspase - 3 activation in the spermatogenic cell apoptosis resulted from Ssh2 KO . 358 Consistently , these findings support the hypothesis that Ssh2 KO results in round 359 spermatid arrest with malformed acrosomes during spermatogenesis and that this in turn 360 causes spermatid apoptosis via the Bcl - 2 / Caspase - 3 pathway . 361 Ssh2 KO leads to disrupted acrosome biogenesis 362 To better understand the defects in Ssh2 KO spermatid development , we performed an 363 immunofluorescence analysis to evaluate the morphology of the differentiating spermatids 364 in WT and Ssh2 KO mice . Spermatids in distinct phases of acrosome biogenesis were 365 stained with fluorescein - conjugated peanut agglutinin ( PNA ) , a protein that specifically 366 binds to the outer acrosomal membrane ( Cheng et al . , 1996 ) . We found spermatids of all 367 spermiogenic steps in the testes of WT males : as spermiogenesis progressed , singular 368 acrosomal vesicles derived from proacrosomic vesicles were formed in the Golgi phase 369 ( steps 1 – 3 ) , became flattened during the cap phase ( steps 4 – 6 ) , spread to the laminae 370 ( steps 7 – 8 ) , and were coated onto the nuclei in the acrosome / maturation phase ( steps 9 – 371 16 ) ( Figure 3A , upper panel ) . On the contrary , instead of intact acrosomal vesicles as seen 372 in WT spermatids , multiple scattered proacrosomic vesicles separated from nuclei 373 ( without fusing with each other ) were present in a majority of the Ssh2 KO spermatids 374 ( step 1 – 3 ) ( Figure 3A , lower panel ) , demonstrating that acrosome biogenesis was 375 disrupted starting from the Golgi phase in Ssh2 KO mice . 376 Proacrosomal vesicles do not fuse normally in Ssh2 KO spermatids 377 9 In order to gain insights into the defective acrosome formation in spermatids of Ssh2 KO 378 mice in the Golgi phase , which is characterized by the fusion of Golgi - derived 379 proacrosomal vesicles ( Berruti & Paiardi , 2015 ; Khawar et al . , 2019 ) , we next performed a 380 transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) analysis to explore the ultrastructure of the 381 acrosome in spermatids in WT and Ssh2 KO testes . TEM showed that WT spermatids had 382 a single , large acrosomal vesicle in which the granule was attached to the concave surface 383 of the nucleus and the inner acrosomal membrane was docked to the electron - dense 384 acroplaxome . However , in Ssh2 KO spermatids , mutiple Golgi - derived small 385 proacrosomal vesicles were adjacent to the trans - face of Golgi apparatuses which contain 386 thick Golgi stacks and failed to fuse together to yield the acrosomal vesicle . Moreover , no 387 acroplaxome - like structure was observed near the nuclear envelope ( Figure 3B ) . These 388 results suggest that the impairment of acrosome formation in Ssh2 KO mice might result 389 from the failure of proacrosomal vesicle fusion and / or from defects in vesicular trafficking 390 towards the nuclear surface . 391 Note that these impaired acrosome biogenesis phenotypes appear similar to observations 392 in mice with mutations in Gm130 ( Han et al . , 2017 ) , which is known to function in Golgi 393 membrane dynamics and and fusion of Golgi - derived vesicles ( Koreishi et al . , 2013 ; 394 Walker et al . , 2004 ) . To determine whether Ssh2 KO affects the fusion of proacrosomal 395 vesicles in the Golgi phase , we performed co - immunostaining of GM130 with PNA 396 staining of seminiferous tubule squashes of WT and Ssh2 KO mice . We observed GM130 397 signals with vesicle - like and stack - like shapes in close contact with the PNA - labeled 398 acrosomal vesicles in WT spermatids . However , in Ssh2 KO spermatids , only large 399 GM130 - positive fluorescent aggregates that exhibited no association with PNA - positive 400 proacrosomal vesicles were observed ( Figure 3C ) , suggesting that the localization of 401 vesicular fusion - associated GM130 is altered in Golgi - phase spermatids by Ssh2 KO . 402 Collectively , these data indicate that Ssh2 KO causes failure of proacrosomal vesicle 403 fusion . 404 SSH2 accumulates at the acrosomal region in round spermatids 405 To investigate the functions of SSH2 in spermatogenesis , we examined the pattern of 406 SSH2 accumulation in testes at several developmental time points using western blotting . 407 We observed a gradual increase in accumulation during murine spermatogenesis . The 408 protein was undetectable in PD7 testes , became detectable at PD14 , and was substantially 409 increased by PD21 , the time when round spermatids first appear in seminiferous tubules 410 ( Guan et al . , 2020 ) , suggesting a potential function of SSH2 in spermatid development 411 ( Figure 4A ) . 412 To determine the developmental roles of SSH2 in spermatogenic cells , we performed 413 counterstaining of SSH2 with PNA on seminiferous tubule paraffin sections of WT and 414 Ssh2 KO mice . SSH2 accumulated predominantly in spermatocytes and post - meiotic 415 round spermatids . In addition to the ubiquitous distribution observed in the cytoplasm of 416 the germ cells , we noted bright , isolated SSH2 - positive puncta positioned in the acrosomal 417 region next to the nuclei of round spermatids ( Figure 4B , left column ) . In contrast , 418 fragmented acrosomes with a lack of SSH2 signal were detected in Ssh2 KO spermatids 419 ( Figure 4B , right column ) . 420 To further understand the involvement of SSH2 in acrosome biogenesis , we assessed its 421 subcellular localization in spermatids at the different phases . Spermatids in seminiferous 422 tubule squashes obtained from adult WT and Ssh2 KO mice were immunostained with 423 PNA and SSH2 for further observation in greater detail . Well - formed acrosomes in 424 developing spermatids of WT mice exhibited diverse shapes at the different phases of 425 acrosome biogenesis ( Figure 4C , upper panels ) . In contrast , many irregular , fractured PNA 426 10 fluorescence signals were observed in most of the Ssh2 KO spermatids , and no cap - like 427 PNA - positive structures were detected ( Figure 4C , lower panels ) . Moreover , the 428 association of SSH2 with the growing acrosome was clearly evident by the acrosomal 429 localization of SSH2 in the spermatids of WT mice ( Figure 4C , upper panels ) . Together 430 these results show that SSH2 is functionally involved in acrosome biogenesis . 431 Ssh2 KO alters F - actin organization in developing spermatids 432 It has been reported that SSH2 binds to F - actin in cultured HeLa cells , where it 433 antagonizes LIMK1 - induced actin polymerization ( Ohta et al . , 2003 ) . To test whether F - 434 actin organization in spermatids is affected by Ssh2 KO during acrosome biogenesis , we 435 first visualized F - actin structures in WT and Ssh2 KO testicular sections at PD21 , PD35 , 436 and PD60 using fluorochrome - conjugated phalloidin . As the representative images 437 showed , the F - actin staining was altered in Ssh2 KO spermatids . Unlike the expected 438 sharp , sickle - shape heads of elongated spermatids surrounded by organized F - actin 439 bundles seen in WT mice , the F - actin aggregated to form numerous lumps in Ssh2 KO 440 round spermatids ( supplementary Figure S5 ) . This aberrant accumulation of F - actin 441 suggests that loss of Ssh2 accelerates filament growth in spermatids rather than inducing 442 filament disassembly . 443 To further compare the successive changes in F - actin morphology during acrosome 444 biogenesis in WT and Ssh2 KO developing spermatids , we performed 445 immunofluorescence microscopy on testicular sections co - stained with phalloidin and 446 PNA . Phalloidin staining was diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm of round spermatids 447 and intact F - actin bundles located around the laminal acrosomes in elongated spermatids 448 of WT mice . In contrast , punctate phalloidin signals accompanied by thick F - actin bundles 449 were mostly dissociated from the fractured acrosomes in Ssh2 KO spermatids ( Figure 5A ) . 450 Moreover , we co - immunostained the spermatids with phalloidin and PNA in seminiferous 451 tubule squashes from WT and Ssh2 KO mice . As expected , confocal microscopy showed 452 that punctate F - actin signals were distributed ubiquitously throughout the cytoplasm of 453 Golgi - phase spermatids of WT mice , with relatively intense fluorescence signals localized 454 at acrosomal regions . However , robust phalloidin staining was scattered irregularly in 455 Ssh2 KO spermatids and exhibited no association with the acrosomal signals ( Figure 5B ) . 456 Together , these findings indicate that F - actin is disorganized in Ssh2 KO spermatids 457 during acrosome biogenesis . 458 Ssh2 KO impairs proacrosomal vesicle trafficking 459 Given the disrupted acrosome biogenesis and disorganized F - actin in Ssh2 KO spermatids , 460 we hypothesized that SSH2 facilitates Golgi - acrosome vesicular trafficking by modulating 461 F - actin organization . To test this hypothesis , we performed immunostaining against PNA 462 and GOPC ( an acrosome - related protein implicated in vesicle trafficking from the Golgi 463 apparatus to the acrosome ( Yao et al . , 2002 ) ) in WT and Ssh2 KO spermatids in 464 seminiferous tubule squashes . In WT Golgi - phase spermatids , GOPC retained its distinct 465 distribution , which was predominantly confined to the acrosomal region as indicated by its 466 colocalization with PNA - positive structures near the nuclei ( 76 . 50 ± 3 . 70 % ) . In contrast , 467 in Ssh2 KO spermatids GOPC exhibited dispersed localization in the cytoplasm and the 468 extent of GOPC - PNA colocalization was significantly diminished ( 23 . 75 ± 7 . 72 % ) 469 ( Figure 6A , 6B ) . These results suggest that the participation of GOPC in proacrosomal 470 vesicle trafficking is negatively affected in Ssh2 KO mice . 471 We then tested whether the localization of the autophagy - related protein LC3 , which is 472 reported to function in Golgi - derived proacrosomal vesicle trafficking through its 473 membrane conjugation ( H . Wang et al . , 2014 ) , was affected by Ssh2 KO . 474 11 Immunofluorescence analysis of LC3 was conducted on seminiferous tubule squashes 475 from WT and Ssh2 KO mice . We observed that LC3 was localized on proacrosomal 476 vesicles in most of the WT spermatids ( 89 . 45 ± 2 . 50 % ) , as indicated by its colocalization 477 with PNA . In contrast , vesicle - like LC3 - positive fluorescent signals surrounded the PNA - 478 positive structures , and a portion of the LC3 molecules were not recruited to proacrosome 479 vesicles in Ssh2 KO spermatids ( 77 . 75 ± 5 . 91 % ) ( Figure 6C , 6D ) . Together , these results 480 indicate that Ssh2 KO results in impaired trafficking of proacrosomal vesicles to the 481 growing acrosome . 482 Ssh2 KO spermatids display impaired COFILIN phospho - regulation and thus have 483 disturbed F - actin remodeling 484 In considering the potential molecular mechanisms underlying the observed impairment of 485 acrosome biogenesis in Ssh2 KO mice , we focused on the known role of SSH2 as a 486 COFILIN phosphatase ( Ohta et al . , 2003 ) . Given our observation of disorganized F - actin 487 in Ssh2 KO spermatids , we speculated that SSH2 acts as a modulator in actin remodeling 488 though COFILIN dephosphorylation , which is essential for spermiogenesis . To pursue this 489 further , we monitored the expression of COFILIN , phospho - COFILIN ( p - COFILIN ) , and 490 protein kinases that directly phosphorylate COFILIN ( e . g . , LIMK1 and LIMK2 ( Arber et 491 al . , 1998 ) ) by western blotting of testicular lysates of PD82 WT and Ssh2 KO testes . The 492 Ssh2 KO mice had elevated levels of p - COFILIN compared to their WT littermates , 493 whereas there were no significant differences in the levels of total COFILIN , LIMK1 , or 494 LIMK2 ( Figure 7A , supplementary Figure S6 ) . Accordingly , we also conducted an 495 immunofluorescent analysis on testicular sections from adult WT and Ssh2 KO mice using 496 the antibody against p - COFILIN . Notwithstanding some mild nuclear staining in round 497 spermatids , we did not observe evident p - COFILIN signals in the germ cells in WT testes . 498 As expected , compared to WT mice , the signal intensity of p - COFILIN was dramatically 499 increased in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of Ssh2 KO spermatogenic cells , in particular 500 in spermatids ( Figure 7B ) . These findings suggest that COFILIN phospho - regulation is 501 impaired in Ssh2 KO testes with subsequent accumulation of p - COFILIN . 502 To further determine whether the effect of SSH2 on the actin cytoskeleton is mediated 503 by the control of COFILIN phospho - regulation , we performed both western blotting and 504 immunostaining against SSH2 , p - COFILIN , and F - ACTIN in WT and Ssh2 KO testicular 505 lysates and sections , respectively . Not surprisingly , we observed increased expression of 506 F - actin accompanied by p - COFILIN in Ssh2 KO testes ( Figure 7C ) . Fluorescence images 507 also showed ubiquitous p - COFILIN signals overlapping with disorganized F - actin 508 aggregates in Ssh2 KO spermatids ( Figure 7D ) . Collectively , these findings support a role 509 for SSH2 in orchestrating F - actin remodeling through the control of COFILIN 510 phosphorylation during acrosome biogenesis . 511 Discussion 512 Although SSHs exert COFILIN phosphatase activity in mammals , the organ distribution 513 of SSH family members varies significantly in mice , implying their similar but diverse 514 biochemical functions ( Ohta et al . , 2003 ) . In the present study , we show the essential role 515 of SSH2 in acrosome biogenesis and male fertility based on the genetically engineered KO 516 mice targeting Ssh2 . Our findings demonstrate the reproductive phenotype of severe 517 spermatogenic arrest at the early round spermatid stage with enhanced germ cell 518 apoptosis , which leads to subsequent male infertility in Ssh2 KO mice . The males lacking 519 functional SSH2 display disrupted germ cell development starting from the spermiogenic 520 step 2 – 3 round spermatids . Further examinations showed aberrant acrosome morphology 521 in the mutant spermatids during spermiogenesis , characterized by fragmented acrosomal 522 12 debris without the fusion of proacrosome vesicles . We also observed disorganized F - actin 523 in the mutant developing spermatids accompanied by impaired proacrosomal vesicle 524 trafficking , and this suggests a fundamental role for F - actin organization in acrosome 525 formation . In addition , enhanced phosphorylation of COFILIN with thick F - actin fibers 526 was seen in Ssh2 KO testes . We interpret these findings as evidence for a role for SSH2 in 527 acrosome biogenesis via the regulation of COFILIN - mediated F - actin remodeling ( Figure 528 7E ) . 529 The implication of COFILIN in development has been described in model animals , as is 530 evident by the embryonic lethality of Cofilin - 1 KO mice ( Gurniak , Perlas , & Witke , 531 2005 ) . Non - muscle COFILIN was identified as a component of tubulobulbar complexes in 532 rat Sertoli cells ( Guttman , Obinata , Shima , Griswold , & Vogl , 2004 ) and as a key activator 533 of human sperm capacitation and the acrosome reaction ( Megnagi , Finkelstein , Shabtay , 534 & Breitbart , 2015 ) , but its functions in mammalian spermatogenesis have remained largely 535 elusive . Our finding that the enhanced cell apoptosis in Ssh2 KO testes shares some 536 similarities with the abnormal phenotype observed in the seminiferous tubules of Limk2 537 KO mice ( Takahashi et al . , 2002 ) suggests a potential role for COFILIN in regulating the 538 germ cell cycle in mice . Another line of evidence linking COFILIN to apoptosis comes 539 from the investigations performed in cell contexts . Treating A549 cells with thapsigargin , 540 an inhibitor of endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase , also induces apoptosis through the 541 inhibition of COFILIN - mediated F - actin reorganization ( F . Wang et al . , 2014 ) . Elevated 542 COFILIN phosphorylation after SSH2 knockdown was previously demonstrated to induce 543 the activation of Caspase3 / 7 in a human renal cell carcinoma cell line ( Lu et al . , 2014 ) , 544 and activation of Caspase3 / 7 is known to trigger apoptotic cell death ( Saller et al . , 2010 ) . 545 Consistently , we observed distinct Caspase - 3 activation accompanied by correlative 546 changes in the expression of Bcl - 2 family members in Ssh2 KO testes . Based on these 547 findings from published literatures and our current study , we speculate that the mutant 548 spermatids in Ssh2 KO mice possibly undergo cell cycle arrest via the Bcl - 2 / Caspase 549 cascade due to impaired COFILIN phosphorylation . Future studies are needed to further 550 elucidate the mechanisms underlying this actin - based process . 551 Owing to the resolution limitation of microscopy , we could not directly image the 552 ultrastructure of F - actin tracts between the Golgi body and the acrosome . However , the 553 observation from TEM that the lack of the electron - dense acroplaxome , a cytoskeletal 554 actin - rich scaffold plate that anchors the acrosome to the nuclear envelope ( Kierszenbaum , 555 Rivkin , & Tres , 2003a ) , in Ssh2 KO spermatids indicates a potential role of SSH2 in the 556 shaping of the acroplaxome . Notably , defective acroplaxome structures with impaired 557 acrosome biogenesis were observed in mutant spermatids lacking homeodomain - 558 interacting protein kinase 4 ( Crapster et al . , 2020 ) , which is responsible for the regulation 559 of F - actin remodeling during spermiogenesis . We infer from these findings that acrosome 560 biogenesis in Ssh2 KO mice might also be affected by the acroplaxome defects that result 561 from disordered F - actin remodeling , and further experiments should be performed to 562 confirm this . 563 In conclusion , our study confirms the requirement for SSH2 during mammalian 564 spermatogenesis , specifically in acrosome biogenesis . Because the Slingshot family are 565 evolutionary conserved in mammals , we believe that some mutations in the SSH2 gene 566 should exist in non - obstructive azoospermia , although no such mutations have , to the best 567 of our knowledge , been reported . At the very least , clues to elucidating the phenotypes of 568 the Ssh2 KO mouse model can help us to understand the pathogenic mechanisms of this 569 potential factor in causing azoospermia . 570 References 571 13 Agarwal , A . , Baskaran , S . , Parekh , N . , Cho , C .

SSH2 participates in F - actin remodeling by regulating the phosphorylation of 911 COFILIN . Intact and organized F - actin dynamics enables the transport of proacrosomal 912 vesicles from the Golgi apparatus to the apical pole of the nucleus of the spermatid . F - 913 actin also participates in the fusion of Golgi - derived vesicles and extra - Golgi vesicles . 914 Source data 7 .
