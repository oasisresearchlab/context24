Genome - wide analysis of human kinases in clathrin - and caveolae / raft - mediated endocytosis Lucas Pelkmans 1 , Eugenio Fava 2 , Hannes Grabner 2 , Michael Hannus 4 , Bianca Habermann 1 , 3 , Eberhard Krausz 2 & Marino Zerial 1 Endocytosis is a key cellular process , encompassing different entry routes and endocytic compartments . To what extent endocytosis is subjected to high - order regulation by the cellular signalling machinery remains unclear . Using high - throughput RNA interference and automated image analysis , we explored the function of human kinases in two principal types of endocytosis : clathrin - and caveolae / raft - mediated endocytosis . We monitored this through infection of vesicular stomatitis virus , simian virus 40 and transferrin trafﬁcking , and also through cell proliferation and apoptosis assays . Here we show that a high number of kinases are involved in endocytosis , and that each endocytic route is regulated by a speciﬁc kinase subset . Notably , one group of kinases exerted opposite effects on the two endocytic routes , suggesting coordinate regulation . Our analysis demonstrates that signalling functions such as those controlling cell adhesion , growth and proliferation , are built into the machinery of endocytosis to a much higher degree than previously recognized . Endocytosis supports a wide range of cellular functions , including nutrient uptake , downregulation of growth factors , cell - surface homeostasis , synaptic transmission and pathogen defence . Regu - lation of endocytic pathways is tightly coupled to the ability of cells to recognize , respond and adapt to extracellular stimuli . Different endocytic uptake mechanisms , including clathrin - mediated endocy - tosis ( CME ) , caveolae / raft - mediated endocytosis , macropinocytosis and transactions between endosomes 1 , are not only regulated by signalling molecules but also themselves contribute to signal trans - duction mechanisms 2 – 4 . A detailed understanding of these multi - faceted processes would beneﬁt from a comprehensive analysis of the components necessary for endocytic transport and their responses to physiological stimuli , which is now possible owing to the availability of genomic sequences 5 . We reasoned that an important ﬁrst step in understanding the supra - molecular regulation of endocytosis was to explore the role of the human kinome ( the genomic collection of human protein , lipid and carbohydrate kinases ) in endocytosis 6 . Only a small number of protein kinases have so far been implicated in endocytic transport 1 , 7 – 9 . Here we undertook a genomic approach , systematically silencing predicted human kinases by RNA inter - ference ( RNAi ) , and determining the consequences of this silencing on two endocytic entry routes . High - throughput viral entry screens Endocytic transport is a multi - step process consisting of ligand binding and sequestration into internalization sites , the formation , transport , tethering and fusion of endocytic carriers with endosomal compartments , the sorting of cargo , and cargo distribution to its ﬁnal destination 1 , 10 . To identify genes regulating these events , we exploited two viruses that hijack the endocytic pathway to infect host cells 11 , 12 , because virus infection is efﬁcient , reproducible and easily measurable . Vesicular stomatitis virus ( VSV ) enters cells via clathrin - mediated endocytosis into early and late endosomes 13 . Simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) is transported to the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) 14 upon caveolae - mediated endocytosis via caveosomes 15 – 17 , as well as by non - caveolar , lipid raft - mediated endocytosis 18 . Notably , the same endocytic routes collectively regulate the signalling response of growth factor – receptor complexes 4 , 19 – 21 . The screening was performed using HeLa cells because their genes can be efﬁciently silenced with short interfering ( si ) RNA 22 . Three days after transfection ( 90 % transfection efﬁciency and . 70 % reduction in messenger RNA ) , separate HeLa cell populations were infected with the two viruses using a low multiplicity of infection ( MOI 0 . 1 ) , to detect both reductions and increases in infection . As proof of principle ( Supplementary Fig . S1a ) , we veriﬁed that VSV infection was speciﬁcally reduced by the silencing of established endocytic regulators like clathrin heavy chain and early endosome antigen 1 ( EEA1 ; refs 23 , 24 ) , that SV40 infection was reduced by silencing of ﬁlamin and ceramide - glucosyl - transferase 25 , 26 , and that both were reduced by ablation of N - ethylmaleimide sensitive factor ( NSF ) 27 . The partial ( 40 % ) inhibition of SV40 infection observed upon silencing of caveolin - 1 ( Cav1 ) indeed reﬂects virus entry via a caveolin - and clathrin - independent , but lipid raft - dependent mechanism 18 , 28 . Genome - wide functional analysis of human kinases The average relative infection index ( RII , the ratio of infected siRNA - treated cells to infected control - treated cells ) of VSV and SV40 was consistently reduced at least threefold by ( 1 ) silencing of the afore - mentioned genes , ( 2 ) using established inhibitors like GTPase - deﬁcient dynamin2 ( dynamin2 - K44A ) , or ( 3 ) using methods such as endosomal pH neutralization ( NH 4 Cl ) , cytosol acidiﬁcation ( chlorpromazine ) or cholesterol depletion ( nystatin / progesterone ) ( RII # 0 . 33 , Fig . 1a and Supplementary Fig . S1a ) .

An RII greater than or equal to 3 . 00 was used as the threshold for scoring enhance - ment ( RII $ 3 . 00 ) , indicating a repressor of the pathway . A kinase was assigned as being involved in both clathrin - and caveolae - mediated endocytosis pathways if both RIIs were , 0 . 4 or . 2 . 50 . Importantly , all RII values selected by these criteria fell outside the intervals deﬁned by 3 s . d . of a large series of negative controls ( Fig . 1a ) . See Supplementary Table S1 for a complete list of kinases and silencing phenotypes . Out of the 590 human kinases screened ( including lipid , protein , carbohydrate and hypothetical kinases ) , we identiﬁed a large number ( 208 ) as being involved in the two infectious entry routes . Whereas VSV infection was typically reduced , SV40 infection was enhanced for about half of the kinases . With the exception of CDK2 and GAK / auxillin , the kinases previously implicated in endocytosis ( AAK1 , Lck , c - Src , GSK3b , protein kinase C ( PKC ) isoforms and CK2 ) were represented , showing that the screen identiﬁed the expected genes . A number of control tests were used to verify that the high number of hits reﬂected a prominent regulatory role for the kinome in the infectious entry routes , rather than promiscuity of the assays . First , silencing of 50 randomly selected genes ( see Supplementary Table S2 ) yielded only one hit ( OXCT1 , Fig . 1b ) , suggesting that the kinome is speciﬁcally enriched in regulators of the two infectious routes . Second , mRNA from 72 % of the whole kinome and at least 90 % of the hits could be detected in untreated HeLa cells , indicating that most of the kinase genes selected are expressed in HeLa cells . Third , we addressed kinome - wide the effects on cell proliferation and apoptosis ( Fig . 1a ) . Although silencing of some genes reduced cell Figure 1 | High - throughput , genome - wide analysis of human kinases involved in infectious virus entry ( VSV or SV40 ) , cell proliferation and cell death . a , Average RII values , relative cell numbers ( RCN ) and relative Annexin - V staining ( RA5 ) , plotted on a log 2 scale , of the silencing of 590 kinases in triplicate .

Quite the opposite was found for SV40 , in that genes required for cell proliferation were suppressors of infection and vice versa , suggesting that the hits did not generally reﬂect toxicity or cell death . Fourth , more than 80 % of the hits were pathway - speciﬁc . 92 kinases scored in VSVinfection , 80 in SV40 infection , and of the 36 affecting both VSV and SV40 infection , 23 gave inverse phenotypes , enhancing one pathway at the expense of the other . Virus entry phenotypes include endocytosis phenotypes Because our primary assays measure translation of an early - transcribed viral gene , some of the kinases identiﬁed could poten - tially be involved in virus - speciﬁc , post - endocytic events , including Figure 2 | Phenotypic proﬁling . a – f , Representative images of phenotype classes are shown .

To validate the role of kinases in endocytosis , we applied secondary , high - content assays using an automated , high - throughput spinning disk confocal microscope ( see Methods ) . First , we re - screened the complete kinome for ﬂuorescent transferrin ( Tfn ) uptake and trafﬁcking , and monitored four differ - ent phenotypicclasses ( Tfn Classes 1 – 4 ; see Fig . 2 and Supplementary Table S1 ) . For a subset of 50 kinases ( selected for their inverse phenotypes or unknown function ) , we monitored an additional 18 phenotypic classes for the two endocytic routes ( Fig . 2 ) . These included the morphology and distribution of cargo in the early endosome ( stained using antibodies against EEA1 ) and late endo - some ( using antibodies against lysosomal antigen marker protein 1 or LAMP1 ) , the distribution and morphology of caveolin - 1 – GFP ( Cav1 – GFP ) - positive structures , trafﬁcking of cargo to late endo - somes ( using ﬂuorescent low density lipoprotein , LDL ) , and trafﬁck - ing of cargo by caveolae / raft - mediated endocytosis ( using ﬂuorescent cholera toxin B , ChTxB ) ( Fig . 2 and Supplementary Table S3 ) . This phenotypic proﬁling veriﬁed that at least 72 % of kinases affecting VSV infection ( 92 / 128 ) also played a role in CME , and that 87 % of the phenotypically proﬁled kinases involved in SV40 infec - tion ( 34 / 39 ) yielded perturbations in caveolae / raft trafﬁcking . By extrapolation , the majority of kinases identiﬁed in the primary virus infection screens are thus predicted to be involved in endocytic trafﬁcking . The secondary assays also conﬁrmed that the two endocytic routes are differentially regulated : 21 % ( 27 / 129 ) of the kinases acting in CME affected SV40 infection , and none of the kinases involved in caveolae / raft - mediated endocytosis affected VSV infection . To order the kinases into a functional pattern , we performed a two - step cluster analysis 29 ( Supplementary Table S3 ) . First , hier - archical clustering was performed on the VSV / SV40 RIIs , differen - tiating ten groups of kinases with highly correlating phenotypes ( Fig . 3 , Groups 1 – 10 ) . Second , within each group , kinases were clustered according to the RIIs and all phenotypic classes of the endocytic routes shown in Fig . 2 ( Fig . 3 ) . In addition , we manually annotated structural properties and previously ascribed functions ( Supplementary Table S3 and references therein ) , and hierarchically clustered those kinases with well - established functions within Figure3 | Hierarchical two - stepclusteringofRIIsandphenotypicproﬁles . For a full explanation , see Supplementary Table S3 . First , the SV40 and VSV RIIs were hierarchically clustered 29 . Ten groups that clustered strongly ( . 0 . 9 ) were identiﬁed . Next , the RIIs , RCN , RA5 and phenotypic proﬁles ( accordingtotheClassesoutlinedinFig . 2 ) ofthekinaseswerehierarchically clustered within each group , resulting in the depicted list of kinases . For the manual annotation of previously ascribed functions for each kinase , see Supplementary Table S3 . NCBI URLs for each kinase are listed in Supplementary Table S1 . NATURE 3571—6 / 5 / 2005—VBICKNELL—148660 ARTICLES NATURE 4 © 2005 Nature Publishing Group these different functional groups ( Fig . 4 ) . Cumulatively , the results revealed the existence of interconnected functional groups , as illustrated in the following examples . Regulation by metabolic kinases Silencing of kinases regulating metabolic pathways might be expected to yield unspeciﬁc effects . Notably , 17 metabolic kinases scored speciﬁcally in VSV and 14 in SV40 infection . This speciﬁcity might in part reﬂect the need for speciﬁc lipids or glycans in both endocytic pathways . For example , GNE ( Fig . 3 , Group 4 ) regulates the production of sialic acid , which is required for biosynthesis of the SV40 receptor GM1 ( ref . 26 ) , and silencing of GNE speciﬁcally reduced SV40 infection . Knock - down of FLJ12171 ( also known as FN3KRP ; Fig . 3 , Group 7 ) , a kinase that removes fructosamines from proteins , speciﬁcally blocked VSV infection and resulted in Tfn accumulation in enlarged endosomes ( Tfn Class 3 ) . This suggests unexpected regulatory functions of fructosamine modiﬁcations in the early endocytic pathway . Figure 4 | Effects of signalling pathways on endocytosis . a , Using the previously ascribed functions ( see Supplementary Table S2 ) , kinases were assigned to 11 groups , in a non - exclusive manner : ( 1 ) not characterized at all , ( 2 ) poorly characterized , or involved in ( 3 ) regulation of the cytoskeleton , ( 4 ) integrin signalling and adhesion , ( 5 ) biosynthesis and metabolism , ( 6 ) GPCR signalling cascades involving DAG , Ca 2 þ and cAMP , and the kinases PKC and PKA , ( 7 ) mTOR signalling , ( 8 ) apoptosis , ( 9 ) signallingfrom RTKsand RSTKs , ( 10 ) kinasesfunctionallylinkedto PI ( 3 ) K , ( 11 ) the Wnt signalling pathway , ( 12 ) the JNK / MAPK cascade , and ( 13 ) the cell cycle . Kinases were then phenotypically clustered within each group ( see Supplementary Fig . S2 ) . b , Thegeneraleffects on each endocytic route of the functional groups ( see Supplementary Fig . S2 ) were deduced and indicated by coloured lines . Note that the colour code corresponds to the RNAi phenotype of a particular kinase . Red indicates that a kinase is required or is an activator of the pathway , and green indicates a kinase that is a suppressor of the endocytic pathway . c , Four representative examples of highly interconnected signalling networks . The TOR pathway regulating cell growth in response to nutrients speciﬁcally maintains or even stimulates CME . The integrin - signalling cascade , which controls focal adhesion assembly and turnover , is speciﬁcally required to activate or maintain caveolae / raft - mediated endocytosis . Ca 2 þ / calmodulin - dependent signalling and actin turnover orchestrated by Cdc42 / Rac1 are two interconnected systems that exert opposite effects on the endocytic routes , suppressing caveolae / raft - mediated endocytosis while sustaining CME . A more complex regulatory activity is observed for the stress - induced and mitogenic signalling ( JNK / MAPK ) cascades , which can exert positive as well as negative effects on both endocytic routes . There are also connections between endocytosis and the cell cycle as well as programmed cell death . The phenotypes of the individual kinases are indicated by colours and by the position of that colour within the kinase symbol ( colour on the left , VSV phenotype ; colour on the right , SV40 phenotype ) . Generalized effects of networks on the endocytic routes are indicated with black arrows ( required or activating ) or black inhibitory symbols ( suppressing ) . NATURE 3571—6 / 5 / 2005—VBICKNELL—148660 NATURE ARTICLES 5 © 2005 Nature Publishing Group VSV infection and CME Of the 80 kinases for which silencing strongly blocked VSV infection with little effect on SV40 infection ( Fig . 3 , Groups 7 and 8 ) , 48 acted at different stages of the endocytic pathway . Phenotypes were observed in uptake , recycling and degradative transport . For example , silencing of SSTK ( also called TSSK6 ) a Ser / Thr kinase with unknown function , inhibited internalization of Tfn ( Tfn Class 1 ) . Silencing of AAK1 , which negatively regulates transferrin endocytosis , increased transport and accumulation of Tfn in perinuclear endosomes ( Tfn Class 2 ) , but also reduced VSV infection and uptake of low - density lipoprotein ( LDL ) ( LDL Class 1 ) . Regulation by TOR - dependent signalling . Tor2p has been shown to regulate a - mating - factor receptor endocytosis in S . cerevisiae . Silencing of FRAP1 ( mammalian TOR ) and ﬁve members of the TOR signalling pathway ( PDPK1 , PRKAA2 , PRKACA , RPS6KL1 , EEF2K ) ( Fig . 3 , Groups 7 – 10 and Fig . 4 ) speciﬁcally blocked VSV infection , Tfn internalization ( RPS6KL1 , Tfn Class 1 ) , intracellular trafﬁcking ( PRKAA2 , FRAP1 , Tfn Class 1 and 3 ) , or recycling ( EEF2K , Tfn Class 2 ) . This shows that the nutrient - dependent TOR signalling pathway not only regulates ligand uptake but also imposes control at multiple steps of the CME pathway in human cells . Regulation by G - protein receptor - linked kinases . Phosphorylation of G - protein - coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) by G - protein receptor - linked kinases ( GPRKs ) leads to their arrestin - dependent down - regulation by CME . We found that silencing of four different GPRKs expressed in HeLa cells ( GPRK5 , GPRK6 , GPRK7 and RHOK / GRK1 ) speciﬁcally reduced VSV infection and Tfn internalization ( Tfn Class 1 and 4 ) . GPRKs can therefore exert a more general form of control over CME , beyond the internalization of GPCRs . Cytoskeleton - dependent transport and cell polarity . Our screen assigned a prominent role in endocytosis to a number of regulators of both the actin and tubulin cytoskeleton . Silencing of MYLK ( Fig . 3 , Group 7 ) , which phosphorylates myosin light chain , caused an early block in Tfn uptake ( Tfn Class 1 and 3 ) . Silencing of FLJ14813 ( also called MASTL ) , a microtubule - associated Ser / Thr ( MAST ) - like kinase , reduced the accumulation of LDL in perinuclear structures ( LDL Class 3 ) , suggesting that it is required for late endocytic transport . Ablation of PTK9L ( Fig . 3 , Group 7 ) , which binds monomeric actin and can be phosphorylated by c - Src , CK2 ( CSNK2A1 , see below ) and PKC z ( PRKCZ ) , resulted in redistribution of Tfn - positive vesicles to membrane protrusions and lamellae ( Tfn Class 3 and 4 ) . PKC z , which regulates cell polarization , might therefore re - programme the activity and distribution of the recycling system via PTK9L . Silencing of ULK1 and ULK2 blocked Tfn internalization ( Tfn Class 1 ) ( Fig . 3 , Groups 7 , 8 and 10 ) . Both of these kinases are homologous to C . elegans Unc51 . 1 , which binds to microtubules , regulates Rab5 - dependent endocytic transport 30 ( as part of a com - plex with SynGAP and syntenin ) , and is involved in axonal elongation . SV40 infection and caveolae / raft - mediated endocytosis Because SV40 can use caveolae - mediated endocytosis , as well as a very related ( if not identical ) uptake route internalizing lipid rafts in the absence of Cav1 ( ref . 18 ) , the kinases we identiﬁed as affecting SV40 infection might be involved in both endocytic routes . Indeed , silencing of ten kinases in HeLa cells conditionally depleted for Cav1 by RNAi affected SV40 infection as in control cells ( Supplementary Fig . S1b ) . These data suggest that this group of kinases also function in caveolae - independent , raft - dependent endocytosis , acting as regu - lators of this enigmatic transport route . Among the 43 kinases speciﬁcally required for SV40 infection , we detected a series of interesting phenotypes to do with caveolae trafﬁcking . For example , silencing of KIAA0999 ( FLJ12240 ) , an unknown Ser / Thr kinase , and DYRK3 , a MAPK - related kinase involved in cell growth and survival ( Fig . 3 , Group 5 ) , caused a redistribution of green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) - labelled Cav1 and internalized ChTxB to enlarged vesicular structures ( ChTxB Class 1 ) . We also observed clustering of caveolae at peripheral foci ( Cav1 – GFP Class 5 ) , tubulation of intracellular Cav1 – GFP - positive structures ( Cav1 – GFP Class 6 ) , and diffuse cell - surface staining ( Cav1 – GFP Class 4 ) ( Fig . 2 ) . Using quantitative total internal reﬂection ﬂuores - cence microscopy , we could show a speciﬁc role for kinases at different stages of the caveolar assembly and transport cycle 31 . Regulation by focal adhesion and integrin signalling . SV40 infec - tion was speciﬁcally reduced by silencing of ( 1 ) PTK2 / FAK and SRC ( Fig . 3 , Group 5 ) , which regulate integrin - dependent focal adhesion assembly and turnover , ( 2 ) MRC2 , a collagen receptor tyrosine kinase , and ( 3 ) several other members of cell adhesion - dependent signalling ( FYN , AKT1 , TYRO3 , PAK6 and SPHK1 , Fig . 3 ) . The clustering of Cav1 – GFP - positive and ChTxB - positive structures at peripheral foci ( Cav1 - GFP Class 5 ) seen after silencing of SRC and MGC26597 ( a predicted proteinwith potential phosphatidylinositol - 4 - phosphate - 5 - kinase , PI ( 4 , 5 ) K activity ) , suggests that these kinases regulate caveolae / raft - mediated trafﬁc to , and from , focal adhesions , supporting the idea that the extracellular matrix can modulate this trafﬁcking route 32 , 33 . Cdc42 - mediated suppression of endocytosis . As a prerequisite to internalization by caveolae , SV40 is thought to stimulate a cycle of cortical actin depolymerization and polymerization 34 . Interestingly , among the hits that speciﬁcally enhanced SV40 infection were two PI ( 4 , 5 ) Ks ( PIP5K1A , PIP5K2C ) , a PH - domain - containing Src - family kinase ( TEC ) that activates Cdc42 and actin polymeriza - tion , and two Cdc42 effectors , ACK1 / TNK2 and TESK2 , which enhance actin polymerization . These data suggest that caveolae / raft - mediated endocytosis is suppressed by the stabilizing effect that Cdc42 - and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - dependent signalling have on cortical actin . However , as MGC26597 is required for SV40 infection , different PI ( 4 , 5 ) Ks might regulate the actin cycle and exert opposite effects on this endocytic route . Coordination between endocytic pathways Among the 36 kinases found to have a role in both VSV and SV40 infection , a subset ( 23 kinases ) exerted opposite effects on the two virus entry mechanisms . For those kinases for which silencing inhibited VSVinfection and enhanced SV40 infection ( Fig . 3 , Groups 9 and 10 ) , phenotypic proﬁling revealed a functional associationwith transport to late endosomes . For example , knockdown of two Ca 2 þ channels with kinase domains ( TRPM6 , TRPM7 ) inhibited VSV infection and stimulated SV40 infection . Similar effects were observed for several Ca 2 þ / calmodulin - activated kinases ( for example , CASK , DAPK1 , DAPK2 , DGKD ) , silencing of which caused early or late endosomes to accumulate underneath the cell surface . The concomitant enhancement of SV40 infection suggests either that caveolae / raft - mediated endocytosis compensates for reduced CME , or that cargo internalized by caveolae bypasses the endosomes , leading to increased transport of SV40 to the ER and enhancing infection 28 . Actin cytoskeleton . Among the kinases coordinating the two endo - cytic routes were effectors of Cdc42 and Rac1 , implicated in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton ( see above ) . Their activity in endocytosis correlated with the intracellular distribution of endo - somes , as shown by the opposite effects of PTK9 and PAK1 . Silencing of PTK9 ( twinﬁlin ) , which binds monomeric actin and is targeted by Cdc42 and Rac1 to regions of high actin turnover , inhibited VSVand enhanced SV40 infection , and redistributed endocytic organelles to the cell periphery . Conversely , depletion of the p21 - activated kinase PAK1 , an effector of Cdc42 and Rac1 that depolymerizes actin , increased VSV infection , reduced SV40 infection , and induced the clustering of endocytic organelles in the perinuclear region . Wnt / b - catenin signalling . Silencing of two glycogen synthase kinases ( GSK3A and GSK3B ) and three casein kinases ( CSNK1D , MGC33182 / CSNK1A1L and CSNK2A1 ) , all known to signal for proteasomal degradation of b - catenin in the absence of Wnt ligand , NATURE 3571—6 / 5 / 2005—VBICKNELL—148660 ARTICLES NATURE 6 © 2005 Nature Publishing Group reduced VSV and enhanced SV40 infection . Notably , ablation of GSK3B and CSNK1D resulted in accumulation of Tfn in early endosomes ( Class 3 ) , suggesting that b - catenin degradation is regulated by the same kinases that control endocytic downregulation of cell - surface components ( for example , cadherins ) . Mitogenic and other signalling pathways . Our comparative analysis of phenotypes in clathrin - versus caveolar / raft - dependent pathways , cell growth , proliferation and apoptosis has provided an integrated view of signalling and endocytosis . The screen identiﬁed pro - apoptotic kinases ( for example , Death - associated protein kinase 1 DAPK1 ) , the ablation of which yielded an endocytic phenotype ( Fig . 4 ) . One surprise was the extent to which the mitogenic signalling cascade participates in endocytosis ( Fig . 4 ) : nine receptor tyrosine kinases ( RTKs ) and four receptor Ser / Thr kinases ( RSTKs ) expressed in HeLa cells were either required for ( four for SV40 , none for VSV infection alone , two for both SV40 and VSV infection ) or suppressed ( ﬁve for SV40 and three for VSV infection ) the virus infectious entry routes . In addition , we identiﬁed at least 28 kinases of the mitogenic signalling / JNK cascade 35 – 37 with a variety of differ - ent phenotypic classes . Among the silencing phenotypes of the 37 suppressors of SV40 infection ( Fig . 3 , Group 3 , for example , ZAK , VRK1 and RAF1 ) , we frequently observed diffuse or ﬁne , punctuate staining of Cav1 – GFP in the periphery of the cell ( Cav1 – GFP Class 4 ) , with ChTxB accumulating in enlarged intracellular vesicles ( ChTxB Class 2 ) . As CME and endosome fusion are arrested during mitosis 38 , 39 , we were not surprised to see the screen identify kinases regulating cell - cycle progression ( Fig . 4 ) . Silencing of MAP2K1 ( MEK1 ) and CNK ( also PLK3 or Polo - like kinase - 3 ) , known to fragment the Golgi during the cell cycle , re - targeted Tfn - containing endosomes to plasma membrane protrusions ( Tfn Class 4 ) , suggesting that this signalling cascade also regulates the distribution of recycling endo - somes . This mechanism might serve to partition endosomes between daughter cells or supply membranes to the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis . Changes in Cav1 and MAPK p38 phosphorylation To explore the function of kinases on the target endocytic machinery , we inspected the phosphorylation of Cav1 because it has been suggested to regulate endocytosis of caveolae / lipid rafts 40 , 41 . Unex - pectedly , we detected increased levels of phosphorylated Cav1 and changes in localization upon silencing of several kinases required for SV40 infection ( Fig . 5a ) . Because silencing of ARAF / ARAF1 and DYRK3 also modiﬁed the cellular distribution of Cav1 – GFP ( Cav1 – GFP Class 1 and 6 ) , coat stability and dynamics of caveolae on the cell surface 31 , our data suggest that , in addition to Cav1 phosphorylation , a network of kinases positively and negatively regulates the dynamics and transport activity of caveolae . We observed cytosolic staining of EEA1 ( EEA1 Class 2 ) upon silencing of the stress - activated kinase MAPK14 ( p38 b ; Fig . 2 ) . Like JNK , p38 MAPK lies at the centre of stress - induced signalling cascades 37 and regulates endocytosis by phosphorylating com - ponents of the endocytic machinery 42 , 51 . We tested whether kinases regulating CME could act through phosphorylation of p38 . Phos - phorylated p38 was low in non - stimulated cells , but increased upon silencing of several kinases required for VSV infection ( Fig . 5b ) . Concomitantly , and although the non - phosphorylated kinase is mainly cytosolic 42 , phosphorylated p38 associated with enlarged endosomes ( Fig . 5b ) . Thus , ablation of various kinases mimics the stress - induced activation of p38 MAPK 37 resulting in recruitment of phosphorylated p38 to endosomes and modulation of endocytosis . Discussion Since the initial observations that kinases regulate endocytosis 43 , a more general appreciation of their role at distinct steps of the endocytic pathway has been lacking 1 . Our genome - wide screen ﬁlls this gap by contributing a comprehensive analysis of the involvement of human kinases in two endocytic routes . For example , the identi - ﬁcation of new kinases regulating the stability of the caveolar coat and caveolae dynamics provides long - sought - after regulators of this transport route 31 . Furthermore , our screen reveals some new design principles governing endocytosis . First , we identiﬁed an unexpected number of kinases ( 210 ) involved in endocytosis , several of which Figure 5 | Phosphorylation of Cav1 and p38 MAPK . a , HeLa cells silenced for the indicated kinases were ﬁxed and stained with a monoclonal antibody againstcaveolin - 1 phosphorylated on Tyr14 ( P - Cav1 ) .

In control cells , low levels of phosphorylated p38 are detected . Silencing of the indicated kinases induces hyperphosphorylation of P - p38 , which is then detected on intracellular , enlarged endosome - like structures ( see insets ) . NATURE 3571—6 / 5 / 2005—VBICKNELL—148660 NATURE ARTICLES 7 © 2005 Nature Publishing Group ( 47 ) were poorly characterized or uncharacterized . Although not all kinases would be expected to play a direct mechanistic role in endocytosis ( see below ) , we observed high selectivity for one of the two endocytic routes , even for regulators of metabolic functions . Second , the ﬁnding that some kinases can positively affect one endocytic route at the expense of of the other suggests that clathrin - and caveolae - mediated endocytosis are coordinated to ensure a proper balance in membrane homeostasis and signalling activities . Third , a large group of the kinases identiﬁed in our endocytosis screen also function invarious signalling pathways , strengthening the emerging paradigm that endocytic transport and signal transduction are tightly coupled . This might in part explain the complexity observed , in that only some kinases within a given signalling network act directly upon the endocytic machinery , with the majority having only a modulatory role . A generalization of the higher - order control of signalling cascades on the endocytic pathway is depicted in Fig . 4a , b . Depending on the signalling system , kinases entrain the endocytic machinery to respond with either clathrin - or caveolae / raft - dependent endocytosis , or both . It appears that endocytosis is subjected to regulatory control by the signalling machinery even under normal growth conditions . For example , our data and others 51 argue for a role of the stress - response p38MAPK 42 in endocytosis also under physiological conditions . These observations form a framework for rethinking how cells respond and adapt to different stimuli . Endocytosis has a muchwider role than downregulating activated growth factor – receptor com - plexes 44 – 47 , by providing spatio - temporal regulation to the signalling response . First , growth factor – receptor complexes can modify their own intracellular itinerary , by activating downstream kinase cascades . For example , four mitogenic kinases suppress caveolae / raft - mediated endocytosis by regulating Cav1 phosphorylation . As caveolae keep signalling molecules in an inhibited state 48 , this feed - back mechanism might be universally applied in controlling cell proliferation : A signiﬁcant correlation across the kinome ( Fig . 2c ) indicates that kinases required for cell proliferation tend to suppress caveolae / raft - mediated endocytosis , whereas inhibitory kinases have the opposite effect . In addition to these general considerations , the endocytic response to kinases clearly also depends on the cell type . Second , by regulating the motility of endosomes along the cytoske - leton , kinases might enable signalling molecules on endosomes to propagate signals from the plasma membrane to the nucleus bydirect transport rather than simple diffusion 49 . Our ﬁndings have also implications for biomedical research and drug development , through the identiﬁcation of new mechanisms of action and potential therapeutic targets . Finally , by extending our high - throughput analysis to the entire human genome , we will eventually be able to obtain a functional genetic map of endocytic pathways . The challenge thenwill be to translate this framework into a quantitative model that incorporates parameters including transport kinetics , changes in morphology and localization , and response magnitude , and can predict responses under different physiological conditions . METHODS siRNA design and silencing efﬁciency . Three unique sites within the coding sequence ofeachhumankinasewere selected ( CenixBioscience GmbH ) , 21 - mer oligonucleotides synthesized ( AmbionInc . ) and genesilencing potentialveriﬁed by real - time polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) . The most potent 21 - mers ( resulting in . 70 % reduction of mRNA levels after 3 days ) were included in the kinase siRNA library . Re - screening of 50 kinases using the VSV and SV40 infectious entry assays with independent siRNA sequences resulted in the same phenotype in 48 / 50 ( SV40 ) and 50 / 50 cases ( VSV ) . High - throughput siRNA screening of infectious virus entry . rVSV – GFP and SV40 ( strain 776 ) were prepared according to published protocols 17 , 50 . Between cell plating and ﬁxation , no washing steps were required . HeLa cells ( 4 , 000 per well ) were plated in 80 m l of complete medium in 96 - wellplates and incubatedat 37 8 C and 5 % CO 2 . The next day , 1 m l of 10 m M siRNA , diluted in 16 m l of Optimem with 0 . 4 m l oligofectamine in 2 . 6 m l Optimem , was added directly to the cells and incubated for 3 days . After 3 days , cells were incubated for 3h with rVSV – GFPorfor 36hwith SV40at 37 8 C and5 % CO 2 . After infection , cells were ﬁxed with paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) , permeabilized with Triton X - 100 ( TX100 ) and stained with 4 , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI ) . A monoclonal anti - body directly conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 ( AF488 ) was used to detect SV40 large T - antigen expression . In separate plates , gene - silenced , PFA - ﬁxed and BSA - blocked cells were stained with 1 m gml 2 1 AF488 - Annexin - V for 1h in PBS . Automated imaging and quantiﬁcation . In a fully automated and double - blind manner , ﬁve images were taken per well , the total number of cells ( DAPI ) and infected cells ( GFP / AF488 ) per well calculated , and average and standard deviations for triplicate experiments determined . These were used to calculate RII , relative cell number ( RCN ) and relative Annexin - V staining ( RA5 ) ( Fig . 1 ) . For determination of the signal noise , numbers obtained from each ﬁeld of control - treated cells were not averaged , but regarded as individual measure - ments of the noise spectrum . High - content endocytosis assays . Fixed and permeabilized cells were stained with anti - EEA1 or - LAMP1 antibodies ( BD Biosciences Pharmingen ) and appropriate secondary antibodies . Cav1 distribution was studied in siRNA - treated HeLa cells stably expressing Cav1 – GFP 28 . For ligand trafﬁcking , siRNA - treated HeLa cells were incubated in 1 m gml 2 1 AF488 - Tfn for 10min , 1 m gml 2 1 DiI - LDLfor30min , and1ngml 2 1 AF488 - ChTxBfor60min . Cellswerewashed , ﬁxed and stained with DRAQ5 ( Alexis Biochemicals ) to visualize nuclei . The Opera automated spinning - disk confocal microscope ( Evotec Technologies GmbH ) was used to image 96 - well plates , using 488 - nm , 532 - nm and 633 - nm laser lines and a water - immersion 20 £ objective with a numerical aperture of 1 . 2 . Twentyﬁeldsper well ( eachcontaining , 100cellsundercontrolconditions ) were imaged and experiments were performed in triplicate . Images were analysed manually and phenotypes scored when appearing in at least ﬁve ﬁelds in each triplicate . Hierarchical clustering . The phenotypic classes were ﬁrst converted into a numerical representation : The value 1 . 000 ( 2 0 ) was assigned to all samples with no phenotypes , and the value 0 . 125 ( 2 2 3 ) to the phenotype observed . If two phenotypes were observed within one assay ( for example , Tfn Class 1 and 3 ) , each phenotype was given the value 0 . 250 ( 2 2 2 ) . In a few cases where the phenotype was less penetrant , it was given the value 0 . 500 ( 2 2 1 ) . For Fig . 3 , the RII values were loaded into Cluster 3 . 0 , log 2 - transformed and hierarchically clustered using uncentred correlation and centroid linkage 29 , yielding ten infection - phenotype groups of kinases clustering . 0 . 9 . Next , the RII , RCN , RA5 and phenotypic proﬁling values were loaded into Cluster 3 . 0 by infection - phenotype group , and processed as above . In Fig . 3 , 11 functional groups were assembled on the basis of functions previously ascribed to the kinases . Next , the RII , RCN , RA5 and phenotypic proﬁling values were loaded into Cluster 3 . 0 by functional group , and processed as above . Java TreeView was used to make cluster trees and graphic displays of the phenotypes . Received 28 January ; accepted 17 March 2005 Published online 11 May 2005 . 1 . Conner , S . D . & Schmid , S .
