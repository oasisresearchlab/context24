As of the time of writing , the disease caused by this virus ( known as COVID - 19 ) has already resulted in over 2 million deaths worldwide . SARS - CoV - 2 infections and deaths , however , have been highly unevenly distributed among age groups , sexes , countries , and jurisdictions over the course of the pandemic . Herein , I present a tool ( the covid19 . Explorer R package and web application ) that has been designed to explore and analyze publicly available United States COVID - 19 infection and death data from the 2020 / 21 U . S . SARS - CoV - 2 pandemic . The analyses and visualizations that this R package and web application facilitate can help users better comprehend the geographic progress of the pandemic , the effectiveness of non - pharmaceutical interventions ( such as lockdowns and other measures , which have varied widely among U . S . states ) , and the relative risks posed by COVID - 19 to different age groups within the U . S . population . The end result , I hope , is an interactive tool that will help its users develop a improved understanding of the temporal and geographic dynamics of the SARS - CoV - 2 pandemic , accessible to lay people and scientists alike . 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 INTRODUCTION 26 In 2019 , a novel infectious disease was ﬁrst identiﬁed in Wuhan , a city of approximately 11 million 27 residents located in the Hubei Province of China . This infectious disease , called Coronavirus disease 28 2019 , or COVID - 19 ( Velavan and Meyer , 2020 ) , is now known to be caused by the previously unidentiﬁed 29 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or SARS - CoV - 2 ( Wong et al . , 2020 ) . Following the 30 Wuhan outbreak , cases of SARS - CoV - 2 infection and death were subsequently identiﬁed in Europe , the 31 United States , and ( by the time of writing ) at least 192 countries worldwide . Counting from the beginning 32 of this global pandemic , there have been over 2 . 3 million conﬁrmed COVID - 19 deaths , more than 400 , 000 33 of which have occurred in the United States alone ( CDC , 2021 ) . 34 R ( R Core Team , 2020 ) is a powerful scientiﬁc computing environment used by statisticians , data 35 scientists , academic researchers , and students worldwide . I have built a multifunctional R package 36 ( covid19 . Explorer ) and corresponding web application ( https : / / covid19 - explorer . org ) . The purpose of 37 both is to aid both scientists and lay people better understand the 2020 COVID - 19 pandemic in the 38 United States . Although my focus is on U . S . COVID - 19 data , readers from other countries might also be 39 interested in the project – for instance , because the seasonal dynamics of infection or the age distribution 40 of mortality has been broadly similar among different affected areas of the globe . 41 .

Explorer is a library of functions and data that can be loaded and run using the R scientiﬁc 44 computing software ( R Core Team , 2020 ) . The covid19 . Explorer package is open source and freely 45 available from its GitHub page ( https : / / github . com / liamrevell / covid19 . Explorer / ) . The covid19 . Explorer 46 package in turn depends on the CRAN R packages maps ( Becker et al . , 2018 ) , phytools ( Revell , 2012 ) , 47 randomcoloR ( Ammar , 2019 ) , and RColorBrewer ( Neuwirth , 2014 ) . 48 Though the covid19 . Explorer R package can be downloaded , installed , and run from R on its own , 49 it has primarily been designed to be utilized via a web portal : https : / / covid19 - explorer . org . This web 50 portal was built in the integrated development environment Rstudio ( RStudio Team , 2020 ) , using the 51 web application development system shiny ( Chang et al . , 2021 ) . In addition to those R libraries already 52 mentioned , the web application also uses the package shinyWidgets ( Perrier et al . , 2021 ) . 53 The data used by the various applications of the covid19 . Explorer are all publicly available and were 54 obtained ( unless otherwise indicated ) from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 55 National Center for Health Statistics ( https : / / www . cdc . gov / nchs / ) or the United States Census Bureau 56 ( https : / / www . census . gov / ) . 57 1 . 2 Types of functions in covid19 . Explorer 58 The covid19 . Explorer R package ( and corresponding web application ) consists of two main types of 59 functions . 60 The ﬁrst of these ( exempliﬁed by the shiny web application webpage tabs denominated U . S . COVID - 19 61 infections , Iceberg plot , State comparison , Plausible range , and Infection estimator ) consists of functions 62 that are designed to estimate the true number of COVID - 19 infections over the course of the pandemic . 63 For reasons that I will elaborate below , conﬁrmed COVID - 19 cases underestimate the true number of 64 infections , usually by a substantial margin ( Wu et al . , 2020 ) . Since there are a variety of reasons that the 65 true number of infections ( rather than simply the number of conﬁrmed cases ) is of interest , these various 66 aforementioned applications of the covid19 . Explorer package are all designed to help users apply a model 67 ( of their own design , see below ) to estimate the daily number of new infections , the plausible range of 68 new infections , the cumulative number of infections , or the daily or cumulative infections as a percentage 69 of the total population or per 1M persons . 70 Each of these covid19 . Explorer applications uses a model – but it is one whose parameters must be 71 set by the user . That is to say , users of the covid19 . Explorer package or corresponding web interface will 72 need to specify : ( 1 ) a value or set of values for the infection fatality ratio , IFR ( Roques et al . , 2020 ) , of 73 SARS - CoV - 2 infection through time ; and ( 2 ) an average lag time from infection to death . The values 74 for each of these model parameters have been default values that are fairly reasonable , as detailed in the 75 sections below ; however , users are nonetheless strongly encouraged to apply multiple values and examine 76 the sensitivity of their results . ( In fact , this is one of the main purposes of the project ! ) 77 The second type of function ( exempliﬁed by the web application tabs Deaths by age , Excess mortality 78 by age , and By state ) do not employ an explicit model and exist primarily to permit the user to interact 79 directly with U . S . Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) COVID - 19 death and 2020 excess mortality data , 80 to understand the implications of these data , and to generate interesting or useful data visualizations . 81 The names and corresponding web application tabs of all functions in covid19 . Explorer are given in 82 alphabetical order in Table 1 , below . 83 1 . 3 Estimating infections 84 Since the beginning of this pandemic , it has been widely understood that conﬁrmed COVID - 19 cases 85 underestimate the true number of infections , sometimes vastly ( Al - Sadeq and Nasrallah , 2020 ; Wu et al . , 86 2020 ) . This is likely to be due to multiple factors . One important factor is that there has been limited 87 testing capacity throughout much of the COVID - 19 pandemic in the United States , but particularly when 88 the pandemic was in its earliest days ( Rosenberg et al . , 2020 ) . A second signiﬁcant factor affecting 89 the disconnect between observed cases and true infections are the facts that in the United States SARS - 90 CoV - 2 testing is voluntary , population surveillance testing has been relatively scarce , and many cases 91 of SARS - CoV - 2 infection present asymptotically or with mild symptoms ( Oran and Topol , 2020 ) . As 92 such , I consider conﬁrmed COVID - 19 deaths to be a much more reliable indicator of disease burden than 93 conﬁrmed cases . Deaths , however , are obviously a lagging indicator of infections . 94 2 / 14 .

S . state . Consequently , I chose to use a model in which the number of new infections on the i th day was 95 estimated by simply taking the number of observed COVID - 19 deaths on day i + k ( in which k is the 96 average lag period between initial infection and death , where death is the outcome of infection ) , and then 97 dividing this quantity by the infection fatality rate ( also called the infection fatality ratio or IFR ) . In other 98 words , given 50 COVID - 19 deaths on day i + k , and an IFR of 0 . 5 % , we would predict that 10 , 000 new 99 SARS - CoV - 2 infections had occurred on day i . Both k , the average lag time from infection to death ( in 100 cases of SARS - CoV - 2 infections resulting in death ) , and the IFR are to be speciﬁed by the user . 101 A fairly reasonable lag time between infection and death might be approximately three weeks . For 102 example , during a large outbreak in Melbourne , Australia the time difference between the peak recorded 103 cases and peak conﬁrmed COVID - 19 deaths was around 17 days . Infected persons normally test negative 104 for the ﬁrst few days following exposure ( Kucirka et al . , 2020 ) , so this more or less corresponds with a 105 lag - time of three weeks . 106 Likewise , IFR values ranging from about 0 . 3 % to over 1 . 0 % have been reported over the course of 107 the pandemic . For instance , a study based on an early , super - spreader event in Germany estimated an 108 IFR ( corrected to the demographic distribution of the local population ) of 0 . 36 % ( Streeck et al . , 2020 ) . 109 Other researchers have reported higher estimated IFR . For example , an Italian study estimated an overall 110 infection fatality rate of 1 . 31 % ( Rinaldi and Paradisi , 2020 ) . In general , it is probably reasonable to 111 suppose that IFR has fallen through time as treatment of severely ill patients has improved ( Fan et al . , 112 2020 ) . Likewise , even within the U . S . , IFR is unlikely to be precisely the same at a given date in different 113 jurisdictions , due to differences in demographic structure between areas . 114 I suspect that it is within reason for users of covid19 . Explorer to specify an IFR that is no greater than 115 about 1 . 0 % and that declines gradually from the start of the pandemic towards the present , with a current 116 IFR that is perhaps around 0 . 3 % - 0 . 5 % . covid19 . Explorer permits the user to specify a time - varying IFR 117 by ﬁxing the IFR at each quarter ( on the website ) , or at any arbitrary time interval ( using the R package 118 directly ) , and then interpolating daily IFR between each period using local regression smoothing ( LOESS ; 119 Cleveland 1979 ) . 120 Reporting can vary through time including regularly over the course of the week . ( For instance , 121 fewer COVID - 19 deaths tend to be reported on the weekends compared to Monday through Friday . ) To 122 3 / 14 .

S . daily COVID - 19 deaths ( red bars ) and assumed IFR function ( blue line ) . b ) Ratio of conﬁrmed COVID - 19 cases / estimated infections . take these reporting artifacts into account we used both moving averages and local regression ( LOESS ) 123 smoothing . Both the window for the moving average and the LOESS smoothing parameter are controlled 124 by the user . 125 The approach of using only conﬁrmed COVID - 19 deaths – though robust – does not permit us to 126 estimate the true number of infections between k days ago and the present . For this , I have assumed a 127 sigmoidal relationship between time and the ratio of conﬁrmed cases over the true number of infections 128 ( Figure 1 ) . Since the true number of new infections cannot exceed the number of conﬁrmed cases , logic 129 dictates that this ratio must have a value between 0 and 1 . 130 I decided on a sigmoidal relationship because it seemed reasonable to assume the ratio was very low 131 early in the pandemic when conﬁrming a new infection was limited primarily by testing capacity , but has 132 probably risen ( in many localities ) to a more or less consistent value as testing capacity increased . Since 133 getting tested is voluntary , and since many infections of SARS - CoV - 2 are asymptomatic or only mildly 134 symptomatic , this ratio seems unlikely to rise to very near 1 . 0 in the U . S . regardless of testing . 135 Figure 1 , created using covid19 . Explorer , shows daily estimated infections ( under our model ) / 136 conﬁrmed cases for all U . S . data over the entire course of the pandemic to date in panel Figure 1b , given 137 observed daily deaths ( red bars ) and assumed IFR evolution ( blue curved line ) of panel Figure 1a . 138 Our plot seems to show a ratio of conﬁrmed / estimated infections of about 0 . 45 at the present ; however , 139 the reader should keep in mind that in practice this value is estimated separately for each jurisdiction that 140 is being analyzed , and as such might be lower in some states and higher in others , even for a constant IFR 141 value or function . 142 After ﬁtting this sigmoidal curve to our observed and estimated cases through now − k days , we then 143 turn to the last period . To obtain estimated infections for these days , we simply divide our observed cases 144 from the last k days of data by our ﬁtted values from the sigmoid curve . Figure 2 shows the result of this 145 analysis applied to data for the U . S . state of Massachusetts . 146 In addition to computing the raw number of daily infections , this method can also be used to compute 147 4 / 14 .

To make this calculation , I obtained state populations 148 through time from the U . S . Census Bureau . Data is only given through 2019 , so to estimate state - level 149 2020 population sizes , we used a total mid - year 2020 U . S . population estimate of 331 , 002 , 651 ) to ‘correct’ 150 each 2019 state population size to a 2020 level . 151 Finally , CDC mortality data splits New York City ( NYC ) from the rest of New York state . Since 152 this contrast is interesting ( e . g . , Gonzalez - Reiche et al . 2020 ) , I maintained the separation – and used a 153 mid - 2019 population estimate of ( 8 , 336 , 817 ) for NYC , then simply assumed that the population of NYC 154 has changed between 2015 and 2020 in proportion to the rest of the state . ( Since they have a part : whole 155 relationship , this seemed pretty reasonable . ) 156 1 . 4 Assumptions about estimating infections 157 This model is very simple . In using it , we merely start by imagining that if we knew the true number of 158 infections and the IFR for our population of interest on day i , then we could predict the number of deaths 159 on day i + k , in which k is the lag - time from infection to death ( for SARS - CoV - 2 infections leading to 160 death ) . Having observed the deaths , and supposing a particular value of IFR for day i , we can likewise 161 work backwards and reconstruct the most plausible number of infections for that day . 162 Although the model does not pre - suppose a speciﬁc value or function for IFR , it does require that 163 one be speciﬁed by the user . As such , it is probably worth mentioning the effect of setting an IFR value 164 that is too high or too low compared to the ( invariably unknown ) true IFR for the population of interest . 165 An IFR that is too high ( overall or at a speciﬁc time during the pandemic ) will have the general effect of 166 causing us to systematically underestimate the number of infections that have occurred . This makes sense 167 because if we imagine observing 50 COVID - 19 deaths , an IFR of 0 . 5 % would imply that these deaths 168 correspond to a total of 10 , 000 infections . By contrast , a higher IFR of , say , 1 . 0 % would instead imply 169 that only 5 , 000 infections had occurred . Assuming an IFR value that is too low will ( obviously ) have 170 5 / 14 .

In fact , literature sources report lag - times 172 between two and eight weeks ( e . g . , Yang et al . 2020 ) . Nonetheless , we assert that inferences by our 173 method should not be badly off – so long as IFR does not swing about wildly from day to day , and so long 174 as the number of deaths is not extremely few for any reporting period . We likewise assume a constant 175 lag - period , k , through time . This assumption is perhaps a bit more dubious as it seems quite reasonable to 176 suppose that for a speciﬁc state or jurisdiction that as IFR falls , k might also increase . This is a complexity 177 that we explicit chose to ignore in our model . 178 We assume that a more or less consistent fraction of COVID - 19 deaths are reported as such – that is , 179 that COVID - 19 is neither systematically under - or overreported as the cause of death at any point during 180 the course of the pandemic . A violation of this assumption is not quite as grave as it might seem , however , 181 because it can simply be ‘baked in’ to our model for IFR . For instance , if we think that COVID - 19 182 deaths were under - reported near the start of the pandemic ( due to limited testing capacity ) , this can be 183 accommodated into our model for daily infections simply by specifying a slightly lower IFR value at that 184 time ( keeping in mind , of course , that the true IFR has generally been falling through time ; e . g . , Levin 185 et al . 2020 ) . 186 In estimating the number of daily infections from k days ago to today , we assume that the relationship 187 between time ( since the ﬁrst infections ) and the ratio of conﬁrmed and estimated infections is sigmoidal 188 in shape ( Figure 1 ) . This is a testable assumption that seems to hold fairly well across the entire U . S . 189 ( Figure 1 ) and for some jurisdictions , but less well for others . It is equally plausible to suspect that this 190 ratio could shift not only as a function of time , but also as demands on testing capacity rise and fall with 191 case numbers . This should be the subject of additional study , but our suspicion is that this would not be 192 likely to have a large effect on our model compared to other simpliﬁcations . 193 Finally we assume no or limited reporting delay . This is obviously incorrect . There are two main 194 sources of reporting delay : the delay between when an individual is infected and when they go on to 195 test positive for SARS - CoV - 2 ; and the delay between when an infected patient dies and their death is 196 reported to the CDC . Given this delay in reporting , a more precise interpretation of the estimated number 197 of daily infections , is a ( rough ) estimate of the number of new individuals who would test positive for 198 SARS - CoV - 2 under a hypothetical scenario of universal testing . 199 80k 60k 40k 20k 0k 20k Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Jan Feb Mar confirmed COVID−19 infections New York estimated unobserved infections Figure 3 .

To visualize this phenomenon , I devised an iceberg plot in which we simultaneously graph the 203 number of observed COVID - 19 infections ( above the ‘waterline’ of the graph ) and the estimated number 204 of unobserved infections ( below it ) . Figure 3 gives this analysis for New York state , in which I assumed 205 the same IFR model through time as was used for Figures 1 and 2 . 206 1 . 6 Mapping the distribution of infections across states 207 A hallmark feature of the U . S . COVID - 19 pandemic has been the shifting geographic distribution 208 of infections through time among states . To capture this dynamic , I devised a plotting method for 209 covid19 . Explorer in which I overlay the daily or cumulative COVID - 19 infections under our model 210 ( outlined above ) , separated by state . 211 For this visualization , I selected a geographic color palette such that RGB color values were made 212 to vary as a function of latitude , longitude , and ( arbitrarily ) geographic distance from Florida . This is 213 intended to have the effect of making the regional geographic progression of infection more apparent in 214 the graph . The result can be seen in Figures 4 and 5 . 215 0k 100k 200k 300k 400k 500k e s t i m a t ed ne w i n f e c t i on s / da y Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Jan Feb Mar 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 assumed IFR ( % ) Figure 4 . Daily estimated infections separated by state . This plotting method shares all the assumptions of our infection estimator , above , but adds the 216 additional assumption that our model of IFR is the same for all states . This assumption is quite dubious , 217 in fact , as IFR could be expected to rise in locations were hospital resources are overtaxed by high disease 218 burden ; and , conversely , fall in hospitals were staff have more experience in treating COVID - 19 patients . 219 Although I do not doubt that these nuances are important in making speciﬁc , quantitative statements about 220 the particular number of infections in each state , I nonetheless believe that my method is effective at 221 visually capturing the overall geographic dynamics of the COVID - 19 pandemic in the United States . 222 1 . 7 Visualizing COVID - 19 mortality data 223 In addition to modeling the number of infections through time , the covid19 . Explorer R package and 224 website also allows users to visualize the distribution of COVID - 19 deaths by age and sex , as well as 225 mortality in excess of normal during 2020 compared to other recent years ( 2015 - 2019 ) . 226 Excess mortality ( also called mortality displacement ; e . g . , Huynen et al . 2001 ) is deﬁned as the 227 number of deaths ( for any period ) in excess of the ‘normal’ number of deaths for the same period . To 228 compute the raw death counts for any jurisdiction , I tabulated the 2015 - 2018 counts with the 2019 - 2020 229 provisional counts . To correct observed deaths in prior years to 2020 levels , I simply multiplied the 230 past - year death tally by the ratio the jurisdiction population in 2020 compared to the population in the 231 past year . Finally , to compute excess deaths for any jurisdiction , I then took the death counts ( or corrected 232 7 / 14 .

This treats 2015 through 233 2019 as ‘normal’ years , and 2020 as unusual . 234 1 . 8 The covid19 . Explorer web interface 235 Though the covid19 . Explorer package can be used within an interactive R session , it has also been 236 interfaced to the web by way of the web application that I developed in Rstudio ( RStudio Team , 2020 ) 237 using the shiny web development system ( Chang et al . , 2021 ) . The covid19 . Explorer web application is 238 hosted at the website https : / / covid19 - explorer . org . 239 Figure 5 shows a screenshot of the web application , illustrating an analysis of the estimated cumulative 240 infections through time across U . S . states . In this web application , the user must specify the value of IFR 241 at the beginning of each three month period , and that at the end of the year , beginning on Feb . 1 , 2020 , 242 and ending on Jan . 31 , 2021 . Values on these intervals are interpolated using LOESS smoothing . 243 Figure 5 . The covid19 . Explorer web interface ( https : / / covid19 - explorer . org ) showing estimated cumulative infections among states under the same IFR model as Figures 1 - 4 . 2 RESULTS 244 The purpose of this article is to describe a software tool , which I have largely done in the preceding 245 section . Here , I will attempt to highlight some results and insights that can be obtained by users via 246 interaction with the covid19 . Explorer R package or web application . 247 2 . 1 Herd immunity and the cumulative proportion of the population infected 248 The question of cumulative percent infected is relevant to the ( unnecessarily controversial ) concept of 249 ‘herd immunity’ ( Randolph and Barreiro , 2020 ) . The herd immunity threshold ( HIT ) , whether reached 250 via natural infection or vaccination , is typically deﬁned as the proportion of the population that must 251 be immune in order to cause the basic reproductive number of the virus ( R t ) to fall below 1 . 0 , absent 252 mitigations ( Anderson and May , 1985 ) . When R t has fallen below 1 . 0 , daily new infections should 253 progressively decline . 254 The HIT is normally estimated by taking the reproductive number when 100 % of the population is 255 susceptible ( i . e . , when a new disease emerges , R 0 ) , and computing 1 − 1 / R 0 . For SARS - CoV - 2 various 256 values of R 0 have been represented in the literature , from as low as around R 0 = 2 . 4 ( e . g . , D ' Arienzo and 257 Coniglio 2020 ) , to as high as about R 0 = 5 . 8 ( e . g . , Ke et al . 2020 ) . A value of R 0 equal to 3 . 0 , for example , 258 would imply that herd immunity should be reached after 1 − 1 / 3 or around 67 % of the population have 259 acquired immunity through natural infection or vaccination . 260 8 / 14 .

Explorer R package and web application can be used to evaluate the proportion of 261 individuals in the total population that have been potentially infected with SARS - CoV - 2 , given our model 262 for COVID - 19 IFR through time . The following graph ( Figure 6 ) shows estimated infections as a fraction 263 of the total population for the U . S . state of Texas , using the same IFR model as in Figures 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 . 264 a ss u m ed I F R ( % ) 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Jan Feb Mar a ) assumed infection fatality ratio ( % ) and daily deaths 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 assumed IFR ( % ) daily COVID−19 deaths i n f e c t i on s ( ob s e r v ed o r e s t i m a t ed ) % 0 % 5 % 10 % 15 % 20 % 25 % 30 % Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Jan Feb Mar b ) Texas cumulative observed or estimated infections observedestimateddeaths Figure 6 . a ) Observed daily COVID - 19 deaths and an assumed model of IFR . b ) Estimated cumulative infections ( green ) , cases ( blue ) , and deaths ( red ) , as a percentage of the total population of the state . Though Figure 6 suggests that perhaps around 25 % of the population in Texas has already been 265 infected , users should keep in mind that this is entirely dependent on how we decided to specify our 266 model of IFR through time ! Likewise , though this fraction is considerable , it is still well below the level 267 of infection ( e . g . , 67 % ) required to achieve herd immunity given the majority of published estimates for 268 R 0 of SARS - CoV - 2 . It may be worth noting that some authors have pointed out that the herd immunity 269 threshold from a natural epidemic could be considerable lower than the 1 − 1 / R 0 level expected for 270 random vaccination ( e . g . , Britton et al . 2020 ; Gomes et al . 2020 ) . This is an intriguing possibility , and 271 one that could be qualitatively examined with some of the tools of the covid19 . Explorer package . 272 2 . 2 Computing a plausible range of infection numbers 273 A relatively simple extension of the infection estimation method , described above , is simply to admit 274 uncertainty about the speciﬁc value of the infection fatality rate at any particular time during the pandemic , 275 and then measure the sensitivity of our prediction to a wide range of different values for IFR . 276 This is a potentially valuable exercise , precisely because the question of the IFR for COVID - 19 has 277 been the subject of considerable controversy and confusion ( e . g . , Vermund and Pitzer 2020 ) . This model 278 can be design to accommodate an assumption of broad uncertainty in IFR early during the pandemic , with 279 both decreasing IFR , as well as decreasing uncertainty in IFR , towards the present . This is illustrated for 280 data from the U . S . state of Louisiana in Figure 7 . 281 It should be noted that although the shaded region around the mean number of daily or cumulative 282 infections in Figure 7 looks like a conﬁdence band , it would only be valid to consider it as such if our high 283 and low values of the IFR through time represented a conﬁdence interval around the true infection fatality 284 9 / 14 .

S . state of Louisiana . rate ( and , even then , this conﬁdence interval would only take into account one source of uncertainty about 285 the real daily number of infections – the IFR ) . 286 2 . 3 Comparing daily and cumulative infections between states 287 Another straightforward extension of our above - described model involves directly comparing daily ( or 288 cumulative ) infections between states . 289 This , likewise , could be a useful activity because many readers have undoubtedly observed how 290 common it has become for ( particularly ) popular press sources to attribute different infection dynamics 291 in different states to one public health intervention or another . This attribution may be valid in many 292 instances , but is often confounded by varying infection dynamics through time in the different states being 293 compared . In general , evaluation of non - pharmaceutical interventions on the spread of SARS - CoV - 2 ( e . g . , 294 Liu et al . 2021 ) has been both very difﬁcult and problematic . In Figure 8 , I compare the daily conﬁrmed 295 deaths and estimated infections between the U . S . states of California and Florida . 296 This plotting method obviously shares all of the assumptions of our infection estimator , and ( just like 297 our method for visualizing the geographic dynamics of the pandemic across all U . S . states ) requires that 298 we use the same IFR model for each state . 299 Since the daily and cumulative number of infections scales with population size , valid state - to - 300 state comparisons really only make sense if done on a per - capita basis ( e . g . , infections or deaths / 1M 301 population ) , just as shown here in Figure 8 . 302 2 . 4 COVID - 19 mortality and age 303 Lastly , in addition to modeling the number of SARS - CoV - 2 infections through time , the covid19 . Explorer 304 package can be used to analyze and graph COVID - 19 deaths by age and sex , as well as excess mortality 305 by age and jurisdiction . 306 This functionality too can sometimes lead to valuable insights . 307 10 / 14 .

Daily conﬁrmed COVID - 19 deaths ( a ) or estimated infections ( b ) in the U . S . states of California vs . Florida . For instance , it was widely predicted by media and public health experts that school and college 308 reopening in the fall would like to increased SARS - CoV - 2 infections and increased COVID - 19 deaths 309 among U . S . children and young people ( e . g . , Bansal et al . 2020 ) . 310 In fact , CDC mortality data show exactly the opposite pattern . Figure 9 gives the weekly COVID - 19 311 deaths overall ( in panel a ) and for 15 - 24 year olds ( in panel b ) . We see that although the highest peaks of 312 weekly COVID - 19 deaths in the general population occurred in the Spring of 2020 and the Fall / Winter 313 of 2020 / 21 , peak deaths among 15 - 24 better align to the Summer of 2020 : precisely when schools and 314 colleges were out of session for all students . 315 3 DISCUSSION 316 The SARS - CoV - 2 global pandemic of 2020 and 2021 has upended economies and civil society worldwide . 317 With widespread vaccination campaigns underway in many countries , the pandemic may ﬁnally be in 318 its waning days . Nonetheless , understanding the temporal and geographical dynamics of SARS - CoV - 2 319 infections and COVID - 19 deaths remains a critically important endeavor . 320 In this article , I present an accessible tool – the covid19 . Explorer R package and corresponding web 321 application – that is designed to be used to model U . S . SARS - CoV - 2 infections through time , to understand 322 the differences in epidemic dynamics between states and jurisdictions , to visualize the geographic progress 323 of infection among U . S . states , to graph conﬁrmed COVID - 19 deaths by age and sex , and to compute and 324 visualize excess mortality by age and jurisdiction . 325 Given the impact the SARS - CoV - 2 pandemic has had on almost all of our daily lives over the 326 past year , most readers of this article will know ( or will be unsurprised to learn ) that many other 327 software tools and web - based applications have been developed to help visualize or better understand the 328 temporal or geographic dynamics of COVID - 19 in the United States . I nonetheless believe , however , that 329 covid19 . Explorer application , which has now been online ( in one form or another ) for nearly seven months , 330 contains a number of different functionalities and graphics not readily available in other competing tools . 331 Firstly , no other software or web application , to my knowledge , lets the user build a custom model 332 for the evolution of infection fatality rate ( IFR ) through time .

Weekly conﬁrmed COVID - 19 deaths for ( a ) all ages ; and ( b ) individuals aged 15 - 24 years old in the U . S . allows the scientists and lay people that interact with the software to design their own parameter function 334 ( based a hypothesis or external information ) that will then be used to estimate infections under the model . 335 Likewise , the tool allows covid19 . Explorer users to progressively adjust the assumptions of this model 336 and see how their results change in turn . 337 Secondly , multiple visualization methods of the covid19 . Explorer R package and webpage are simply 338 not represented in other software packages . For instance , I have never observed a graph similar to that 339 of Figure 4 of this article in a publication or popular media source ( other than those reporting on this 340 application ) . Similarly , while it is extremely common to see graphs in the New York Times or other media 341 showing the number of conﬁrmed COVID - 19 cases per day ( the part above the ‘waterline’ in our iceberg 342 graph of Figure 3 ) , I have likewise never once seen a similar plot giving an estimate of the daily number 343 of unobserved infections ( below it ) . 344 Lastly , the covid19 . Explorer package is completely transparent and open source . It pulls the data 345 directly from public , government repositories . All model assumptions ( even those not explicitly described 346 in this paper ) are readily identiﬁed from the software source code . 347 Even if COVID - 19 soon becomes a distant memory , I hope that this tool ( which I plan to make 348 available indeﬁnitely ) will continue to be of use to scientists and educated lay people interested in the 349 learning from the successes and failures of policy during the 2020 / 21 pandemic – perhaps to ensure that 350 there are more of the former and fewer of the latter in our next global infectious disease pandemic . 351 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 352 This research was funded in part by grants from the National Science Foundation ( DBI - 1759940 ) and 353 FONDECYT , Chile ( 1201869 ) . 354 12 / 14 .
