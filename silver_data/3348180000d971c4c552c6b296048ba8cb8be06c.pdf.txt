BCL2L10 ( human Diva or BCL - B ) is a member of the Bcl - 2 family that has contradictory functions in apoptosis . In the present study , we identified the Huntington - interacting protein 1 - related ( HIP1R ) protein following a search for Diva - interacting proteins using the yeast two - hybrid system . HIP1R is a multi - domain protein that regulates the clathrin - mediated endocytic machinery and actin assembly in cells . Interaction of endogenous proteins of BCL2L10 and HIP1R in 293T cells was determined by immunoprecipitation , and their direct association was confirmed by the Far - Western analysis . The deletion of both the AP180 - homology ( ANTH ) and F - actin - binding the talin - HIP1 / R / Sla2p actin - tethering C - terminal homology ( THATCH ) domains of HIP1R greatly compromised its binding ability to BCL2L10 . Ectopic expression of HIP1R resulted in moderate cell death of 293T cells in conjunction with the dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential and caspase 9 activation . A member of proapoptotic Bcl - 2 family , BAK , was required for HIP1R to induce cell death , while BAX was dispensable . In addition , BCL2L10 was associated with endogenous caspase 9 , and their binding was augmented by HIP1R overexpression . Thus , this study provided the previously unknown function of HIP1R involved in the intrinsic cell death pathway and further explored possible mechanisms by which HIP1R induces cell death . Introduction Apoptosis is essential in maintaining the homeostasis of normal cells , and its dysregulation leads a wide variety of disorders including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases [ 1 ] . Evolutionally conserved members of the Bcl - 2 family proteins are central regulators of apoptosis in diverse species [ 2 , 3 ] . Mouse Diva ( Boo ) was initially cloned by two separate groups who reported contradictory observations ; one group reported Diva was pro - apoptotic [ 4 ] , while the other described it as an anti - apoptotic 44 member of the Bcl - 2 family [ 5 ] . Diva forms a ternary complex with apoptosis - activating factor - 1 ( Apaf - 1 ) and caspase - 9 , components of the apoptosome along with cytochrome c [ 5 , 6 ] . The closest human homolog of Diva was later identified and designated human Boo / Diva , BCL2L10 , or BCL - B [ 7 - 9 ] . BCL2L10 is also known to function as either a pro - or anti - apoptotic factor depending on the cellular context [ 7 , 8 ] . In the search of Diva - interacting proteins , we identified Huntington - interacting protein 1 - related ( HIP1R ) , which was originally discovered by its sequence homology with HIP1 [ 10 ] . HIP1R protein consisted of the AP180 - homology ( ANTH ) domain mediating phosphoinositides - interaction [ 11 ] , a coiled - coil domain containing leucine zipper , and an F - actin - binding the talin - HIP1 / R / Sla2p actin - tethering C - terminal homology ( THATCH ) domain [ 12 , 13 ] . The yeast homologue of HIP1R , Sla2p , is required for endocytosis and a functional actin cytoskeleton [ 14 - 16 ] . Accordingly , the well - characterized functions of HIP1R in mammalian cells involve clathrin - mediated endocytic machinery and actin assembly [ 17 , 18 ] . HIP1 and HIP1R share both structural and functional homologies [ 10 , 19 - 21 ] . While HIP1 - induced cell death has been demonstrated [ 22 - 25 ] , the role of HIP1R in the apoptotic signaling pathway has not been reported in detail . In the present study , we described HIP1R as a specific binding partner of BCL2L10 , tested for the functional effects of HIP1R in apoptosis , and provided evidence for the involvement of HIP1R in the intrinsic cellular death pathway . Materials and Methods Chemicals and reagents Unless otherwise indicated all the chemicals were purchased from Sigma ( St Louis , MO ) . Plasmids construction The full - length human BCL2L10 was cloned as in Kang et al . [ 26 ] . The plasmid encoding human HIP1R was kindly provided by Dr . Theodora S . Ross ( The University of Michigan ) , and pCMV HA or Myc ( Clontech , Mountain View , CA ) HIP1R was subcloned after PCR amplification using the following primers : HIP1R - F ( 5’ - CTA GAA TTC AAA TGA ACA GCA TCA AGA AC ) and HIP1R - R ( 5’ - CTA CTC GAG CTA GTA GTT CAC GAG TTG AGC ) . The Δ ANTH HIP1R insert DNA was PCR amplified with HIP1R - F Δ ANTH ( 5’ - CTA GAA TTC AAA TGC AGT TTC CCG CGG GCC TG ) and HIP1R - R . The Δ THATCH HIP1R mutant was amplified by PCR using the primers HIP1R - F and HIP1R - R Δ THATCH ( 5’ - CTA CTC GAG CTA CTT CAC CCC CGA GCT GGC ) . The Δ ANTH Δ THATCH HIP1R mutant was amplified by PCR using the primers HIP1R - F Δ ANTH and HIP1R - R Δ THATCH . The Δ coiled - coil HIP1R construct was produced by a recombinant PCR technique using the following primers ; HIP1R - F and HIP1R - 340R ( 5’ - GCC CCT GCT CCT GAG AGA GGT CAG CCA CCA CCA ) , HIP1R - 610F ( 5’ - TGG CTG ACC TCT CTC AGG AGC AGG GGC ) and HIP1R - R . The pET22b + ( Novagen , San Diego , CA ) HIP1R construct was produced after PCR amplification using the following primers : pET22b ( + ) HIP1R - F ( 5’ - CTA CTA CAT ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA ) and pET22b ( + ) HIP1R - R ( 5’ - TAG AAG CTT GTA GTT CAC GAG TTG ) . To construct pGBT9 ( Clontech ) BCL2L10 , PCR was performed with primers of 5’ - ACG GAA TTC ATG GTT GAC CAG TTG CGG and 5’ - CTA GGA TCC TCA TAA TAA TCG TGT CCA . The pACT2 ( Clontech ) HIP1R was cloned after PCR amplification using the HIP1R - F and HIP1R - R primers . Yeast two - hybrid system The open reading flame of Diva was fused in frame with the GAL4 - binding domain ( BD ) in the pGBT9 yeast shuttle vector . To identify Diva - interacting proteins , yeast screening of GAL4 - activation domain ( AD ) - tagged rat ovarian fusion cDNA library was performed as previously described [ 26 ] . Mammalian cell culture 293T and mouse embryo fibroblasts ( MEFs ) cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium ( DMEM ) ( Welgene , Seoul , Korea ) containing 10 % heat - inactivated Fetal Bovine Serum ( FBS ) ( Welgene ) and 1 % penicillin - streptomycin ( Welgene ) . Wild - type , bax - / - , bak - / - , and bax - / - bak - / - MEF cells were generous gifts from Dr . CB Thompson ( University of Pennsylvania , PA , USA ) . Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis 293T cells ( 3 . 0 x 10 6 ) were transfected with a total of 6 µg of the respective plasmid DNA using Welfect - EX TM PLUS ( Welgene ) in 100 mm dishes . Cell lysates were prepared with NP - 40 lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl at pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 15 M NaCl , and 1 % NP - 40 ) containing 10 % protease inhibitor cocktail ( Sigma ) The lysates were centrifuged and the supernatants were precleared with normal IgG ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) and Protein - G - Agarose ( Upstate , Charlottesville , VA ) for 2 h at 4°C . The precleared lysates were incubated with primary antibodies for 12 h followed by incubation with Protein - G - Agarose for an additional 1 h at 4°C . The immune complexes were centrifuged and washed 3 times with NP - 40 lysis buffer . For quantitative protein analysis , a standard curve was established with the standard BSA solution ( Pierce , Rockford , IL ) , and equal amounts of total protein were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS - PAGE ) . After transferring the proteins to membranes , the membranes were blocked with 5 % nonfat dry milk . HA - or Myc - tagged HIP1R and its mutant proteins were detected with an anti - HA or anti - Myc monoclonal antibodies ( Sigma ) , and Flag - tagged BCL2L10 was detected with rabbit anti - Flag antibodies ( Sigma : F1804 ) . For the detections of endogenous BCL2L10 and HIP1R proteins , anti - BCL2L10 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology : sc - 8739 ) or anti - HIP1R polyclonal antibodies ( BD Biosciences , Kim / Yoon / Won / Sim / Ko / Han / Lee / Lee / Bae Cell Physiol Biochem 2009 ; 23 : 43 - 52 45 Franklin Lakes , NJ ) were used , respectively . As loading controls , Western blot analyses of GAPDH and β - actin were performed with anti - GAPDH ( AB Frontier , Seoul , Korea ) or anti - β - actin ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology : sc - 47778 ) , respectively . Membranes were stripped using stripping buffer ( 100 mM mercaptoethanol , 2 % SDS , and 62 . 5 mM Tris - HCl at pH 6 . 8 ) by incubation at 50°C for 30 min and were washed with phosphate buffer saline ( PBS ; 137 mM NaCl , 2 . 7 mM KCl , 10 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , and 2 mM KH 2 PO 4 at PH 7 . 4 ) containing 0 . 01 % Tween 20 ( Sigma ) . The secondary horseradish peroxidase - conjugated anti - mouse IgG secondary antibodies ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) were incubated with the membranes at room temperature for 1 h before visualization using enhanced chemiluminescence ( AB Frontier ) . Proteins were detected using the LAS image program ( Fuji , New York , NY ) . Expression and purification of recombinant HIP1R protein The recombinant plasmid , pET22b + HIP1R , was transformed into E . coli BL21 ( DE3 ) . The bacterial culture was induced with 100 mM IPTG ( isopropyl b - D - thiogalactopyranoside ) at 37°C for 2 h and harvested . The pellets were re - suspended and lysed with a French presser . The recombinant HIP1R protein was purified using Ni - NTA resin ( Qiagen , Valencia , CA ) as recommended by the manufacturer . Far - Western blot analysis The BCl2L10 protein overexpressed in 293T cells , as described in a previous section , was separated by SDS - PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane . The blot was placed in TEN 50 buffer ( 10 mM Tris - Hcl pH 8 . 0 , 1 mM EDTA , 50 mM NaCl ) [ 27 ] and stored at 4°C for 5 days to allow in situ renaturation of the protein . Then , the membrane was blocked with HHB ( HEPES - hybridization buffer ; 20 mM HEPES pH 7 . 7 , 75 mM KCl , 0 . 1 mM EDTA , 2 . 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT , 0 . 05 % Triton X - 100 ) containing 5 % skim milk for 1 h and incubated with HIP1R recombinant protein or BSA ( bovine serum albumin ) along with RNase A ( 0 . 2 µg / ml ) at 4°C for overnight in HHB supplemented with 1 % skim milk . The membrane was washed three times for 10 min each with HHB containing 1 % skim milk and subjected to immunoblot analysis . Determination of caspase 9 activation 293T cells ( 1 . 0 x10 6 ) were plated onto 60 mm dishes and transfected with a total of 3 µg of the respective plasmid DNAs . After 24 h after transfection , cell lysates were prepared , subjected to electophorasis , and immunoblotted with anti - caspase 9 antibody ( Cell signaling , Danvers , MA : # 9502 ) that allows to detect both pro and activated forms of caspase 9 . The same membrane was stripped and reprobed sequentially with anti - Flag , - Myc , - HIP1R , - BCL2L10 , BAK ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology : sc - 832 ) and - β - actin antibodies . Some cells were treated with 10 µM of Z - VAD - fmk ( Calbiochem , San Diego , CA ) at 6 h post - transfection . Measurement of changes in mitochondrial membrane potential ( MMP ) Mitochondrial integrity was determined by assaying the loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential ( Δψ m ) using MitoProbe JC - 1 ( 5 , 5 ' , 6 , 6 ' - tetrachloro - 1 , 1 ' , 3 , 3 ' - tetraethyl - benzimidazolcarbocyanine iodide ) Assay Kit for flow cytometry ( Invitrogen ) , as suggested by the manufacturor . Briefly , 293T cells ( 1 . 0 x 10 6 ) were plated on 60 mm dishes and transfected with a total of 3 µg of the respective plasmid DNA . Cells were harvested with trysin - EDTA ( Welgene ) after 24 h of incubation , and the samples were then incubated with 2 µM of JC - 1 for 15 min at 37°C with 5 % CO2 . After washing the cells with PBS , flow cytometry analysis via FACS Caliber ( BD Biosciences , Franklin Lakes , NJ ) was perfromed . Cell viability assay 293T cells were seeded at a density of 3 . 5 x 10 4 per well in 48 - well plates . Twenty - four hours later , cells were transfected with an equal amount of total DNA ( 100 ng ) , along with 10 ng of pEGFP - N1 ( Clontech ) for detection of transfected cells . To determine the involvement of caspases in HIP1R - induced cell death , the transfected cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of z - VAD - fmk for 24 h . MEF cells ( 2 x 10 5 ) were washed with fresh PBS and suspended in 10 µl of resuspension R buffer ( Digital Bio Technology , Seoul , Korea ) containing a total of 500 ng of pcDNA3 and 50 ng of pEGFP - N1 to allow detection of transfected cells . The cells were electroporated using a 10 µl volume - sized tip on a MicroPorator MP - 100 ( Digital Bio Technology ) and incubated on 24 - well plates containing fresh media . At 24 h post - transfection , cells were harvested with trypsin - EDTA ( Welgene ) and resuspended following centrifugation . GFP - positive cells were counted under the fluorescence microscope after adding Trypan blue ( Sigma ) . Data were expressed as the percentage of viable cells when compared to the control group that received an empty control vector . DNA fragmentation assay 293T cells ( 1 . 0 x10 6 ) were plated onto 60 mm dishes and transfected with a total of 3 µg of the respective plasmid DNAs . The cells were harvested after 24 h of incubation by lysis buffer ( 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , 5 mM Tris - HCl at pH 8 . 0 , and 20 mM EDTA ) and centrifuged at 12 , 000 x g for 15 min at 4°C . The supernatant fraction containing fragmented DNA was mixed with 0 . 5 ml of isopropanol at room temperature for 10 min and centrifuged at 12 , 000 x g for 10 min at 4°C . The DNA pellet was washed with 75 % ethanol , resuspended in Tris - HCI ( pH 8 . 0 ) containing 100 µg / ml of RNAse , and incubated for 2 h . The 5 µg of DNA fragments was separated by 2 % agarose gel electrophoresis , stained with ethidium bromide , and photographed under UV light . Statistical Analysis Significance of values when compared to the controls was determined by t - test . HIP1R Induces Apoptosis Cell Physiol Biochem 2009 ; 23 : 43 - 52 46 Results BCL2L10 interacts with HIP1R After identification of HIP1R as an interacting protein of mouse Diva from a rat ovarian cDNA library via yeast two - hybrid screening , the human homologues of the two proteins , BCL2L10 and HIP1R , were cloned and their specific interaction was further determined in yeast . As shown in Figure 1A , BCL2L10 fused with GAL4 Fig . 1 . BCL2L10 directly interacts with HIP1R in vivo . ( A ) Yeast cells were cultured in selective media lacking tryptophan , leucine , histidine , and adenine . Growth was demonstrated in colonies expressing both HIIP1R and BCL2L10 fused to the GAL4 DNA activation domain and binding domain , respectively . No growth of yeast was seen in colonies expressing only HIIP1R or BCL2L10 . ( B ) 293T cells ( 3 . 0 x 10 6 ) were transfected with 3 µg of pcDNA3 Flag - tagged BCL2L10 , Myc - tagged HIP1R , or both and incubated for 24 h . As a control , cells were transfected with the pcDNA3 empty vector ( 6 µg ) . The pre - cleared cell lysates were used for immunoprecipitation ( IP ) experiments with the anti - Myc or anti - Flag antibodies . Following IP , immunoblotting ( IB ) were performed and the immunoprecipitated proteins were detected with anti - Flag or anti - Myc antibodies . ( C ) To identify the endogenous interaction between BCL2L10 and HIP1R , 293T cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the anti - HIP1R antibody , anti - BCL2L10 antibody , or normal IgG followed by Western blots with anti - BCL2L10 or anti - HIP1R antibodies . ( D ) Far - Western blot analysis was conducted with the BCL2L10 - overexpressing mammalian cell lysate and the purified recombinant HIP1R protein . Recombinant HA - HIP1R purified using Ni - NTA resin was analyzed on a SDS - PAGE and detected with the HA antibody ( left panel ) . 293T cells ( 1 . 0 x 10 6 ) were transfected with 3 µg of pcDNA3 empty vector or pcDNA3 Flag - tagged BCL2L10 . The cell lysates were prepared , 25 µg of total protein was loaded in each lane , and blots were made . Overexpressed BCL2L10 was visible by the antibody against Flag . Purified recombinant HIP1R protein ( upper panel ) or BSA were incubated with the renatured blot , and Western blotting was performed with the HA antibody . The membrane incubated with recombinant HIP1R protein was stripped and detected for BCL2L10 and GAPDH with antibodies against Flag or GAPDH , respectively . Exactly the same amount of mammalian total lysates and recombinant HIP1R produced at the same time were used in each lane . DNA binding domain interacted with HIP1R containing the activating domain of GAL4 . The in vivo interaction of BCL2L10 and HIP1R in mammalian cells was determined by immunoprecipitation . Overexpressed Flag - tagged BCL2L10 protein was co - immunoprecipitated with Myc - tagged HIP1R using an anti - HA monoclonal antibody ( Fig . 1B ) . Conversely , HIP1R was also efficiently immunoprecipitated with ectopically expressed Flag - tagged BCL2L10 protein pulled down using the anti - B C D A Kim / Yoon / Won / Sim / Ko / Han / Lee / Lee / Bae Cell Physiol Biochem 2009 ; 23 : 43 - 52 47 A B Fig . 2 . Truncations of both the ANTH and THATCH domains of HIP1R greatly attenuated the interaction with BCL2L10 . ( A ) Different HIP1R mutants ( Δ ANTH , Δ THATCH , Δ ANTH Δ THATCH and Δ Coiled - coil ) lacking domains were generated to delineate the BCL2L10 - binding region of HIP1R . ( B ) 293T cells ( 3 . 0 x 10 6 ) were transfected with 3 µg of pcDNA3 Flag - tagged BCL2L10 along with Myc - tagged HIP1R , Δ ANTH , Δ THATCH , Δ ANTH Δ THATCH or Δ Coiled - coil and incubated for 24 h . The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with either anti - Flag or anti - Myc antibodies , and the immunoprecipitates were Western blotted using anti - Myc or anti - Flag antibodies , respectively . The expression of the mutants was confirmed by immunoblot using anti - Myc antibodies . Flag polyclonal antibody ( Fig . 1B ) . In vivo association of endogenous HIP1R and BCL2L10 proteins was confirmed by the co - immunoprecipitaion of HIP1R and BCL2L10 in 293T cells ( Fig . 1C ) . To address whether the interaction between HIP1R and BCL2L10 is due to a direct association between two proteins , we attempted to produce their recombinant proteins . The recombinant protein of HIP1R was purified , while we were unsuccessful to purify BCL2L10 ( data not shown ) . Alternatively , we performed the Far - Western blot analysis . Overexpressed Flag - BCL2L10 protein from 293T cells was separated by SDS - PAGE , transferred to a membrane . After renaturing proteins in the membrane which is subsequently incubated with recombinant HIP1R protein or BSA as a negative control . The BCL2L10 - bound recombinant HIP1R protein was visible after a detection using the HA antibody ( Fig . 1D ; upper panel ) , pointing the direct interaction between BCL2L10 and HIP1R . Deletion of both ANTH and THATCH domains of HIP1R greatly diminished the interaction with BCL2L10 Because HIP1R has distinct domains that direct its interactions with other proteins , we tried to determine the domain of HIP1R responsible for its interaction with BCL2L10 . Truncated HIP1R mutants were generated , and their binding ability toward BCL2L10 was tested by immunoprecipitation . HIP1R is comprised of ANTH , a central coiled - coil domain containing leucin zipper , and THATCH domains as shown in Figure 2A . HIP1R mutant proteins that lack either the ANTH domain ( Δ ANTH ) , the THATCH domain ( Δ THATCH ) , or the coiled - coil region ( Δ coiled - coil ) were efficiently immunoprecipitated with BCL2L10 ( Fig . 2B ) , suggesting that the truncations of one of ANTH , THATCH , or coiled - coil domains of HIP1R do not affect its association with the BCL2L10 protein , significantly . In contrast , The HIP1R mutant HIP1R Induces Apoptosis Cell Physiol Biochem 2009 ; 23 : 43 - 52 48 Fig . 3 . HIP1R activates caspase 9 and disrupts the mitochondrial membrane potential . ( A ) 293T cells ( 1 . 0 x10 6 ) were transfected with 3 . 0 µg of pcDNA3 empty vector ( lane # 1 ) , Flag - BCL2L10 ( 1 . 5 and 3 . 0 µg ) ( lane # 2 - 3 ) , Myc - HIP1R ( 0 . 3 , 0 . 9 , 1 . 5 and 3 . 0 µg ) ( lane # 4 - 7 ) , and Myc - HIP1R ( 0 . 3 , 0 . 9 and 1 . 5 µg ) together with 1 . 5 µg of Flag - BCL2L10 ( lane # 8 - 10 ) . The cell lysates were prepared after 24 hours of incubation . Activation of caspases was assessed by immunoblot analyses with anti - caspase 9 , anti - caspase 3 , and anti - caspase 8 antibodies . Expression of Flag - BCL2L10 and Myc - HIP1R proteins were determined by Western blots with anti - BCL2L10 or anti - HIP1R antibodies , respectively . Equal loading of the lysates was confirmed by Western blot analyses using the anti - β - actin antibody . ( B ) 293T cells ( 1 . 0 x10 6 ) were transfected with 3 . 0 µg of pcDNA3 empty vector , HA - HIP1R , Flag - BCL2L10 , and BAK , or 1 . 5 µg each of pcDNA3 HA - HIP1R and Flag - BCL2L10 . For the caspase inhibitor treatment , the cells were incubated with z - VAD - fmk ( 10 µM ) at 6 h post - transfection . Twenty four hours after transfection , cell lysates were prepared , subjected to electophoresis , and immunoblotted with respective antibodies . ( C ) 293T cells ( 1 . 0 x10 6 ) were transfected with 3 µg of pcDNA3 empty vector , HA - HIP1R , Flag - BCL2L10 , BAK , or 1 . 5 µg each of pcDNA3 HA - HIP1R and Flag - BCL2L10 . Changes in mitochondrial membrane potential ( MMP ) were measured by FACS analysis after incubation of the cells with JC - 1 . Data are from three independent experiments ( mean ± S . D . ) and presented as percent of MMP relative to the empty vector control . Asterisks represent statistical significance relative to the control ( p < 0 . 05 ) . lacking both ANTH and THATCH domains ( Δ ANTH Δ THATCH ) had a greatly compromised interaction with BCL2L10 as their interaction was barely detectable in the pull - down assay ( Fig . 2B ) . The deletion of ANTH and THATCH domains could possibly lead to a conformational change , improper localization or other conditions , which eventually results in the compromised association with BCL2L10 . HIP1R induces caspase 9 activation Since we observed the interaction of HIP1R with a member of the apoptosis - regulating family , we assessed whether HIP1R itself can activate caspases . Plasmids encoding HIP1R or BCL2L10 were overexpressed in 293T cells , and the lysates were produced after 24 h of incubation . As shown in Figure 3A , increasing expression of HIP1R protein led to the activation of caspase 9 in a dose - dependent manner , while no obvious active forms of caspase 9 was detected in the control cells transfected with an empty vector . The activation of caspase 9 was also observed with ectopic expression of BCL2L10 and the response was augmented after co - expression of HIP1R ( Fig . 3A ) . In addition , cleaved caspase 3 was detectable after co - expression of HIP1R and BCL2L10 , while no significant activation of caspase 8 was observed by Western blot analyses ( Fig . 3A ) . The caspase 9 activation induced by co - expressions of BCL2L10 and HIP1R was less than the one elicited by BAK overexpression and was partially blocked by the presence of a pan - caspase inhibitor , z - VAD - fmk , ( Fig . 3B ) . HIP1R dissipates cellular mitochondrial membrane potential The Bcl - 2 family regulates apoptotic events that involve mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization C B A Kim / Yoon / Won / Sim / Ko / Han / Lee / Lee / Bae Cell Physiol Biochem 2009 ; 23 : 43 - 52 49 Fig . 4 . HIP1R induces caspase - mediated cell death . ( A ) Cell viability assays were performed using 293T cells ( 3 . 5 x 10 4 ) after transfection with increasing amounts of pcDNA3 HA - HIP1R . At zero concentration , the empty vector ( 100 ng ) was used . Three independent experiments , in duplicate , were performed . Data are expressed as the percentage ( mean ± S . E . M ) of viable cells relative to the control . Asterisks represent statistical significance relative to the control ( p < 0 . 05 ) . ( B ) Cell viability was assessed as shown in ( A ) except that the cells were transfected with 100 ng of pcDNA3 HA - HIP1R and incubated with different concentrations of z - VAD - fmk . Asterisks indicate statistically significant values relative to the control ( p < 0 . 05 ) . ( C ) 293T cells ( 1 . 0 x 10 6 ) were transfected with an empty vector ( 3 . 0 µg ) , Flag - BCL2L10 ( 3 . 0 µg ) , Myc - HIP1R ( 3 . 0 µg ) or both ( 1 . 5 µg each ) . The DNA fragmentation was visualized by staining with ethidium bromide . A B C ( MOMP ) and thus the changes in MMP that occur during apoptosis [ 28 ] . Using the metachromatic fluorochrome JC - 1 dye [ 29 , 30 ] , the dissipation of MMP was measured . Forced expression of HIP1R significantly disrupted MMP in 293T cells , but the response was moderate compared to the one elicited by Bak overexpression ( Fig . 3C ) . Although no apparent change in MMP by ectopic expression of BCL2L10 was observed , the co - expression of BCL2L10 with HIP1R caused a distinct MMP dissipation ( Fig . 3C ) . HIP1R induces caspase - mediated cell death Overexpression of HIP1R induced cell death in 293T cells in a dose - dependent manner , but this cell killing effect was not drastic ( Fig . 4A ) . The incubation with increasing concentrations of z - VAD - fmk , a pan - caspase inhibitor , attenuated the cell death elicited by HIP1R ( Fig . 4B ) suggesting that HIP1R - induced cell death entails caspase ( s ) function , at least in part . Because Hoechst staining of the cells revealed that HIP1R expression resulted in discrete chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation from a small population of 293T cells ( data not shown ) , DNA fragmentation assays were performed in cells after overexpression of HIP1R , BCL2L10 or both proteins . As shown in Figure 4C , a significant increase of fragmentation of DNA was not obvious after overexpression of HIP1R compared to the control although HIP1R clearly increased DNA fragmentation occurred by BCL2L10 . Considering the abilities of HIP1R to induce MMP dissipation , caspase activation , and cell death although these effects were not extensive , the DNA fragmentation assay we performed seems to be less sensitive method to assess HIP1R response . HIP1R increases the association of BCL2L10 with caspase 9 Since the mouse ortholog of BCL2L10 , Diva , forms a ternary complex with overexpressed caspase 9 and Apaf - 1 [ 5 , 6 ] , we assessed whether BCL2L10 is also able to interact with the apoptosome . As shown in Fig . 5 , BCL2L10 was efficiently immunoprecipitated with endogenous caspase 9 , whereas binding of HIP1R to caspase 9 was not detectable in this cellular context ( Fig . 5 ) . Next , we examined any influence of HIP1R on the complex formation of BCL2L10 . Interestingly , in the presence of ectopically expressed HIP1R , the association of BCL2L10 and caspase 9 was significantly increased as determined by pull - down experiments with either anti - caspase 9 or anti - Flag antibodies ( Fig . 5 ) . We neither observed the association of endogenous Apaf - 1 with HIP1R nor with BCL2L10 ( data not shown ) , but we are not confident at this point whether it is due to the absence of their interaction or because of low level of endogenous Apaf - 1 that hinders the pull - down assays . BAK is required for HIP1R - induced cell death To further delineate the mechanism by which HIP1R induces apoptosis , we assessed its cell death response in bax - / - , bak - / - , and bax - / - bak - / - MEF cells . Overexpression of HIP1R in wild - type MEF cells exhibited more profound cell death compared to the one in 293T cells ( Fig . 6 ) , HIP1R Induces Apoptosis Cell Physiol Biochem 2009 ; 23 : 43 - 52 50 suggesting MEF cells are more susceptible for HIP1R - induced apoptosis than 293T cells . However , strikingly , HIP1R completely failed to exhibit cell killing effect in the bax - / - bak - / - double knockout cells . The forced expression of HIP1R completely failed to induce cell death in Bak - deficient cells ( Fig . 6 ) . In contrast , HIP1R - induced cell killing effect was not altered in Bax - depleted cells ( Fig . 6 ) . Collectively , these results clearly demonstrate that HIP1R - mediated cell death requires functional Bak protein , implying that Bak is an important mediator of HIP1R response in this circumstance . Discussion In the present study , we provide a new signaling network of HIP1R and BCL2L10 as HIP1R interacted Fig . 5 . BCL2L10 associates with endogenous caspase 9 , which is augmented by HIP1R . 293T cells ( 3 . 0 x 10 6 ) were transfected with 3 µg of pcDNA3 Flag - BCL2L10 , Myc - HIP1R , or both and incubated for 24 h . As a control , cells were transfected with the pcDNA3 empty vector ( 6 µg ) . Following IP , Western blots were performed and the immunoprecipitated proteins were detected with anti - Flag , anti - Myc , and anti - caspase 9 antibodies . Relative caspase 9 binding ( % ) in the left panel represents the portion of BCL2L10 - bound caspase 9 immunoprecipitates ( IP : anti - caspase 9 , IB : anti - Flag ) from total caspase 9 immunoprecipitates ( IP : anti - caspase 9 , IB : anti - caspase 9 ) . Relative Flag - BCL2L10 binding ( % ) in the right panel represents the portion of caspase 9 - bound BCL2L10 immunoprecipitates ( IP : anti - Flag , IB : anti - caspase 9 ) from total Flag - BCL2L10 immunoprecipitates ( IP : anti - Flag , IB : anti - Flag ) . The relative bindings in cells with Flag - BCL2L10 overexpression were considered 100 % . Data are from three independent experiments and are expressed as mean ± S . D . Asterisks indicate a significant value compared to the results followed by the overexpression of BCL2L10 alone ( p < 0 . 05 ) . with a member of Bcl - 2 family , BCL2L10 under the endogenous condition . In addition , the ectopic expression of HIP1R resulted in moderate MMP dissipation , caspase 9 activation , and cell death . The co - expression of BCL2L10 did not seem to critically affect these responses , except for some additive effects ( Fig . 3 ) . Therefore , in this cellular context , we demonstrated that HIP1R induces modest apoptosis , but the significance of the interaction between HIP1R and BCL2L10 proteins under physiological conditions is unclear at this point and requires follow - up studies . Presence of other undiscovered functional networks between these two proteins could also be possible . HIP1R and HIP1 are the only members of the HIP1 family found in mammals [ 19 ] . Both proteins share 49 % identical sequences and exhibit both common and unique cellular properties . Although the influences of HIP1 on Kim / Yoon / Won / Sim / Ko / Han / Lee / Lee / Bae Cell Physiol Biochem 2009 ; 23 : 43 - 52 51 cell survival and death are not uniformly consistent , overexpression of HIP1 induces apoptosis in different cells [ 22 - 25 ] . In contrast , only few previous studies are available regarding the role of HIP1R on apoptosis . The induction of apoptosis by the epsin N - terminal homology ( ENTH ) domain - deleted HIP1R mutant , but not by the full length HIP1R , has been reported [ 19 ] . HIP1 has been known to directly bind to caspase 9 and Apaf - 1 and activates caspase 9 in rat neuronal cells [ 25 ] . Diva or Boo , the mouse ortholog of BCL2L10 , also associates with overexpressed caspase 9 and Apaf - 1 , the components of apoptosome [ 4 , 5 ] . Thus , we assessed the role of HIP1R regarding the complex formation with apoptosome constituents . We for the first time found the association of BCL2L10 with caspase 9 in 293T cells even without its overexpression , and , strikingly , the association was significantly elevated by increasing expression of HIP1R ( Fig . 5 ) . Even though the underlying mechanism is uncertain at this point , the augmented BCL2L10 - mediated activation of caspase 9 after HIP1R overexpression ( Fig . 3A and B ) maybe partly related to the increased binding between BCL2L10 and caspase 9 upon the forced expression of HIP1R . Unveiling the detailed roles of HIP1R and BCL2L10 in the regulation of apoptosome would be of interest . The members of Bcl - 2 family are central regulators of apoptosis in cells , and proapoptotic Bax and Bak are executors of the intrinsic cell death pathway as they act on the mitochondrial outer membrane by forming a pore followed by MOMP and cytochrome c release . Thus , we determined the dependency of HIP1R on Bax and / or Bak for its cell death function using the knockdown cells of bax - / - , bak - / - , and bax - / - bak - / and found that Bak is indispensable for HIP1R - induced cell killing effect while Bax is dispensable ( Fig . 6 ) . Therefore , these data imply that HIP1R - induced cell death is largely , if it is not all , mediated by the intrinsic cell death pathway involving cellular mitochondria . Nakajima et al [ 31 ] unveiled a striking function of BNIP1 , a member of proapoptotic BH3 - only subfamily . They demonstrated that BNIP1 is in a complex with syntaxin 18 and necessary for the maintenance of the endoplasmic reticulum network structure , demonstrating that a Bcl - 2 family member has an additional function beyond its role in mitochondrial apoptotic signaling . Accordingly , the physical interaction observed between BCL2L10 and HIP1R from the present study also provides a previously undiscovered role for a member of Bcl - 2 family , as the major known functions of HIP1R are in the regulation of endocytosis and actin assembly [ 14 - 16 ] . Therefore , it is possible that BCL2L10 may play a role in HIP1R - mediated endocytic and actin machinery , and future studies to uncover the nature of this signaling would be valuable . In summary , this study provides a novel and direct connection between HIP1R and BCL2L10 in apoptosis signaling . Furthermore , we demonstrated that HIP1R is a modest apoptotic molecule that requires BAK to exert its cell death function and enhances the association of BCL2L10 and caspase 9 .

Wild - type and knockout MEF cells for bak - / - , bax - / - and bax - / - bak - / - were transfected with increasing concentrations of pcDNA3 HIP1R , and cell viability was measured after 24 h of incubation . At zero concentration of DNA , pcDNA3 empty vector ( 500 ng ) was transfected to four different cell lines as controls . Data are expressed as the percentage ( mean ± S . D . ) of viable cells relative to the control group . Significant values relative to each control cells transfected with the empty vector or wild - type ( wt ) cells at each respective concentration were indicated with a or b respectively ( p < 0 . 01 ) .
