Abstract Chunk decomposition plays an important role in cognitive ﬂ exibility in particular with regards to representational change , which is critical for insight problem solving and creative thinking . In this study , we investigated the cognitive mechanism of decomposing Chinese character chunks through a parametric fMRI design . Our results from this parametric manipulation revealed widely distributed activations in frontal , parietal , and occipital cortex and negative activations in parietal and visual areas in response to chunk tightness during decomposition . To mentally manipulate the element of a given old chunk , superior parietal lobe appearsto support element restructuring in a goal - directed way , whereas the negatively activated inferior parietal lobe may support preventing irrelevant objects from being attended . Moreover , determining alternative ways of restructuring requires a constellation of frontal areas in the cognitive control network , such as the right lateral prefrontal cortex in inhibiting the predominant chunk representations , the presupplementary motor area in initiating a transition of mental task set , and the inferior frontal junction in establishing task sets . In conclusion , this suggests that chunk decomposition re ﬂ ects mental transformation of problem representation from an inappropriate state to a new one alongside with an evaluation of novel and insightful solutions by the caudate in the dorsal striatum . Key words : caudate , Chinese character , inferior frontal junction , insight , presupplementary motor area Introduction The chunking mechanism , originally proposed by De Groot ( de Groot and de Groot 1978 ) based on studies of problem solving and theorized by Chase and Simon ( 1973 ) , has been established as one of the key mechanisms of human information processing in perception , learning , and cognition ( McLean and Gregg 1967 ; Reitman and Rueter 1980 ; Klahr et al . 1983 ; Gobet and Simon 1998 ) . The usage of chunks helps to overcome cognitive capacity limitations by integrating a number of pieces of information into a single unit . For example , chess masters are capable of recalling more chess pieces on a board than novices because they are able © The Author 2015 . Published by Oxford University Press . All rights reserved .

Although chunking processes are applicable in most cases , it is often necessary to in turn decompose the inappropriate chunks into their component elements so that they can be reorganized in a new meaningful manner , such as , the invention of mov - able - type printing by decomposing the full page of text into their components ( i . e . , the single letters ) . This process is referred to as chunk decomposition in insight problem solving ( Knoblich et al . 1999 ; Luo et al . 2006 ; Wu et al . 2013 ) . Chunk decomposition means to restructure one ’ s knowledge according to the changing environmental demands , which is a key feature of human cogni - tive ﬂ exibility and creativity ( Scott 1962 ; Nijstad et al . 2010 ; De Dreu et al . 2011 ) . In the seminal study of Knoblich et al . ( 1999 ) , chunk decom - position has been proposed as a mental transformation of prob - lem representation , which would result in sudden insight during problem solving . In this regard , tight and loose chunks are de - ﬁ ned on the basis of whether their components are meaningful perceptual units . For example , “ VI ” composed of “ V ” and “ I ” is a loose chunk while “ V ” composed of “ \ ” and “ / ” is a tight chunk . The participant ’ s task was to move one stick to resolve a false arithmetic equation of roman numbers such as “ VI = VII + I . ” Re - sults showed that chunk decomposition performance ( e . g . , solu - tion rate ) is inversely proportional to the tightness of the chunk . However , the limited number of variations in the matchstick roman arithmetic task does not allow investigating the neural mechanism underlying the accomplishment of chunk decom - position with brain imaging techniques . To resolve this issue , Luo and colleagues conducted a series of event - related potential ( ERP ) and fMRI studies of chunk decomposition using Chinese characters as experimental materials because simple and com - plex characters are perfect examples of tight and loose chunks , respectively ( Luo et al . 2006 ; Tang et al . 2009 ; Wu et al . 2009 , 2013 ) . Simple Chinese characters are composed of strokes , which are the most basic components of a Chinese character andusuallydonotcarrymeaningontheirown . Therefore , simple charactersaretightchunksinthesamewaythat “ V ” composedof “ \ ” and “ / ” represents a tight chunk . Complex characters , which consist of radicals are loose chunks , because radicals convey in - formationaboutthemeaningorthepronunciationofacharacter . Studies that contrasted such stroke - level character decompos - ition with radical - level decomposition revealed a functional role of visual cortex ( Luo et al . 2006 ; Wu et al . 2009 ) , dorsal and ventral visual pathways ( Wu et al . 2010 ) , visual - spatial process - ing areas , and linguistic processing areas ( Wu et al . 2013 ) . The above - mentioned regions are relatively function - , or modality - speci ﬁ c , as these are regions involved in processing and memor - izing visual - spatial and linguistic information . Conversely , the role of prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) and other related areas that medi - ateexecutivefunctioningandtop – downcontrolinchunkdecom - position was less straightforward , and their functional role reveals to be less consistent . While lesion ( Reverberi et al . 2005 ) and transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) ( Chi and Sny - der 2011 ) studies indicated that an enhanced ability of chunk de - composition could be associated with frontal damage or inhibition of the left anterior temporal lobes , brain imaging stud - ies in normal adults found that the anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC ) area is selectively activated in the decomposition of tight , meaningful chunks but not for decomposing tight but meaning - less chunks ( Wu et al . 2013 ) . Our previous neuroimaging studies found activations of bilateral inferior ( BA47 ) , middle ( BA9 , BA6 ) , and medial ( BA8 ) frontal gyrus in a direct contrast between insightful ( tight ) and noninsightful ( loose ) chunk decomposition ( Luo et al . 2006 ; Wu et al . 2013 ) . However , the results might have confounded the ef - fects of chunk tightness ( tight vs . loose ) and creativity ( insight vs . noninsight ) , because insightful or creative ways of thinking are usuallymuchmoredif ﬁ culttoachieveortobesuccessfullyrepre - sented in one ’ s mind relative to the noninsightful or ordinary so - lutions . This is probably due to a difference of chunk tightness . Such a confound between insight and dif ﬁ culty could be critical for understanding the role of activations in areas such as the PFC whose function are known to be sensitive to both aspects of the task ( Schneider and Chein 2003 ; Luo et al . 2004 ; see also Dietrich and Kanso 2010 , for review ) . For example , Luo et al . ( 2004 ) found both ACC and lateral PFC involved in the processing ofinsightrelativetononinsightevents . However , furtheranalysis clari ﬁ ed that lateral PFC was responsive primarily to item dif ﬁ - culty and showed higher levels of activation in the dif ﬁ cult rela - tive to easy insight trials , whereas ACC selectively activated in all insight events ( relative to noninsight events ) regardless of dif ﬁ - culty . This impliesthatACC and lateral PFC might be differential - ly involved in detecting and solving cognitive con ﬂ icts in insight , respectively . Therefore , a parametric design that can systematic - ally manipulate the chunk tightness in chunk decomposition is essentially needed to elucidate the distinctive roles of executive function areas , which were reported to be involved in chunk decomposition , justasthen - backdesignthatisimportantinsep - arating the executive components of working memory by para - metrically manipulating task dif ﬁ culty ( Smith et al . 1998 ) . To this end , in this study , we performed a parametric design that consists of a chunk decomposition task with 3 levels that systematically varied in their dif ﬁ culties . The tightness of a chunk is based on objective and clear operational de ﬁ nitions , but not on the inferences from participants ’ subjective ratings , their response times , and solution rates . In the easy or loose chunk decomposition condition ( Level 1 ) , the to - be - removed parts are radicals that carry meanings on their own and are lo - cated separately from other parts of the character . In the inter - mediate or moderately tight chunk decomposition condition ( Level 2 ) , the to - be - removed parts are meaningless strokes that are spatially connected with other parts of the character . Finally , in the hard or tight chunk decomposition condition ( Level 3 ) , the to - be - removed parts are also meaningless strokes , but these strokes are tightly embedded in , or , depict an intersectional con - nection with other parts of the character ( see Fig . 1 A , for exam - ples ) . On the dimension of chunk tightness , these 3 conditions varied parametrically . Therefore , the present design allows iden - tifying the executive functional areasthat reveal activations with a linear change with chunk tightness . Chunk decomposition is a hypothetical mechanism of repre - sentational change , which explains how impasses can be broken in insight problem solving . During chunk decomposition , people need to override the existing representations of chunks and restructure their constituent elements in an alternative way by employing top – down cognitive control . Even though this explan - ation appears reasonable from a cognitive perspective , their underlying neural correlates are not speci ﬁ ed . First , we hypothe - size that , when considering the material characteristic of Chin - ese characters , the restructuring of old chunks should recruit visual and visual - spatialcomponentsinposterior visual andpar - ietal cortex . Second , restructuring is determined by the cognitive control network in frontal areas , such as dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) , presupplementary motor area ( pre - SMA ) , dorsal premotor cortex ( dPMC ) , inferior frontal junction ( IFJ ) ( Cabeza and Nyberg 2000 ; Duncan and Owen 2000 ; Schneider and Chein 2992 | Cerebral Cortex , 2016 , Vol . 26 , No . 7 a t U n i v e r s it ae t s b i b li o t h e k d e r L M U M u e n c h e n on J un e 10 , 2016 h tt p : / / ce r c o r . ox f o r d j ou r n a l s . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m 2003 ; Brass et al . 2005 ; Chein and Schneider 2005 ; Dosenbach et al . 2006 ) . In the present study , participants were asked to mentally decompose chunks with the help of cues that are pro - vided for each trial . Such cues prevent participants from search - ing for relevant solutions themselves and allow adopting the instructed way of restructuring . Participants had to break up ex - isting chunks by overriding the prepotent representations through inhibition , which would be accomplished byright dorso - lateral frontal gyrus ( Evans 2003 ; Goel et al . 2009 ) . Subsequent to restructuring , a new mental representation is supposed to become established , which should be marked by a change from one mental representation to another . This change should in turn activate brain regions consistently involved in set - shifting , such as the presupplementary motor area and the IFJ ( Brass and von Cramon 2002 ; Brass et al . 2005 ; Derrfuss et al . 2005 ; Hikosaka and Isoda 2010 ) . Finally , experiments used various methods , including eye - movement recordings ( Knoblich et al . 2001 ) , fMRI ( Luo et al . 2006 ) , ERPs ( Tang et al . 2009 ; Wu et al . 2009 ) , combined fMRI and ERP measurements ( Wu et al . 2013 ) , neuropsychological patient testings ( Reverberi et al . 2005 ) , and tDCS ( Chi and Snyder 2011 ) , have revealed converging evidence that characterizes the process of chunk decomposition as a spe - ci ﬁ c type of insight problem solving . Insight problem solving usually comes with an unpredictable or novel solution . We thus suggest that the adoption and evaluation of alternative solutions may require procedural memory systems engaging in basal ganglia circuits ( Barnes et al . 2005 ) . Materials and Methods Participants Twenty - two students ( 12 females ; aged 19 – 26 years ) partici - pated in this study as paid volunteers . Participants were right - handed , had normal or corrected - to - normal vision , and reported no history of neurological or psychiatric disorders . Ethical approval was obtained from the institutional review board of Beijing Normal University Imaging Center for Brain Research and all participants gave written informed consent before the experiment . Materials As a logographic writing script , Chinese characters constitute a spatial rather than a phonological system . The orthographic structure makes Chinese characters to be ideal examples of per - ceptual chunks ( Tan et al . 2001 ; Fu et al . 2002 ; Perfetti et al . 2005 ; Tan , Laird et al . 2005 ; Tan , Spinks et al . 2005 ; Luo et al . 2006 ) . The chunk tightness of Chinese characters is de ﬁ ned by their basic identi ﬁ ablecomponent ; compound characterscombinedbyradi - cals are loose chunks and isolated characters formed by strokes aretightchunks . Luoetal . ( 2006 ) andWuetal . ( 2013 ) havealready employed loose and tight chunks of Chinese characters to inves - tigate the neural mechanisms of chunk decomposition . The pre - sent study advanced their investigations by introducing 3 dif ﬁ culty levels of chunk decomposition and the levels of chunk - ing were classi ﬁ ed based on the spatial relationship between to - be - removed parts and characters in an initial question phase ( Fig . 1 A ) . The 2 component parts were spatially separated in the easy condition ( Level 1 ) ; to - be - removed parts were peripherally adjacent to and embedded in the characters as questions in the medium dif ﬁ cult ( Level 2 ) and hard condition ( Level 3 ) , respect - ively . The characters used in the experiment were selected ac - cording to the above criteria and all Chinese characters selected as experimental materials are frequently used characters . Be - sides , the chunking task was introduced as a vigilance task , in which strokes and radicals were added to a character ( Question Phase ) to constitute a new character ( Answer Phase ) . The 3 levels of the chunking task were categorized in a similar way . Procedure Participants were instructed to decompose strokes or radicals from existing characters to constitute a new character . Stimuli were presented via an LCD projector onto a mirror placed in front of the participant in the scanner ( Fig . 1 B ) . The characters and to - be - removed parts were connected by a minus sign , with characters in the left and to - be - removed parts in the right half of the display . Participants had 8 s to determine the target char - acter and they were instructed to press a button as soon as they constructed the target character . Next , they had to decide whether their target character was the same as the character that appeared on the subsequent screen within 3 s . The resting interval between trials was randomly jittered from 2 . 5 to 4 s . There were 30 trials for each level of the decomposition task and 30 trials with no requirement to remove radicals or strokes , with the latter serving as a baseline condition . In addition , 90 ﬁ ll - er trials , which required chunking processes , served to keep participants ’ attention . All of the 210 trials were randomized in the 5 experimental sessions . fMRI Data Acquisition and Analysis All scanning was performed on a 3 - Tesla Siemens TIM scanner using a standard radiofrequency head coil at the State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning , Beijing Nor - mal University . Whole - brain T 2 * - weighted gradient - echo EPI images were acquired based on blood oxygenation level – depend - ent contrast . The imaging parameters were 30 axial slices , repe - tition time = 2000 ms , echo time = 30 ms , slice thickness = 4 mm , slice gap = 0 . 8 mm , interleaved slice acquisition , ﬁ eld of view = 200 mm × 200 mm ( 64 × 64 mesh ) , ﬂ ip angle = 90° . There were 5 runs of 10 min each . High - resolution structural images were acquired using a T 1 - weighted 3D gradient - echo pulse sequence ( 128 sagittal slices , repetition time = 2530 ms , echo time = 3 . 39 ms , Figure 1 . Experimental protocol . Subjects were asked to remove the stroke or radical from the characters on the left side . ( A ) Chunk decomposition levels . Three levels of chunk decomposition were determined by the spatial relationship between the target characters and their to - be - decomposed parts . ( B ) Timing of a sample trial . A trial started with a central asterisk presented for 1000 ms . During the subsequent question phase , the target character and the to - be - decomposed parts appear on the screen for up to 8000 ms ( or until a response key was pressed ) . Subsequent to a ﬁ xation delay of 1000 ms , the answer character was presented for up to 3000 ms or until a response was collected . The ﬁ nal black screen during the inter - trial - interval varied randomly from 2500 to 4000ms .

Image preprocessing and statistical analysis were performed using SPM8 ( Statistical Parametric Mapping ; Wellcome De - partment of Cognitive Neurology , UCL , London , UK ) . The ﬁ rst 4 functional volumes of each run were discarded to avoid a poten - tial T 1 - equilibration effect and remaining images were corrected forsliceacquisitiontiming . Theimageswerethenrigid - bodymo - tion corrected , co - registered with the corresponding T 1 - weighted image , and spatially normalized into 3 - mm isotropic voxels using the standard MNI T 1 brain . Finally , the normalized images were smoothed with an 8 - mm full - width at half - maximum Gaussian kernel and high - pass ﬁ ltered with a 128 - s cutoff period . In the ﬁ rst - level model , for each participant an event - related statisticalmodelwascomposedoftaskeffects , ameanand linear driftforeachofthe5runsand6motionparameters . Taskseffects were computed by creating a boxcar function for each event type with its respective response period , which was convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function . Three decom - position events and a baseline event at the problem - solving phase were modeled as task conditions of interest . Incorrectly , solved trials at the problem - solving phases and all events at the solution judgment phase were modeled as separate regres - sors of noninterest . Except for task effects , a mean and linear drift foreach of the 5 runs and 6 motion parameters were also in - cluded in the statistical model . At the second level , the contrast images of interest at the individual level were submitted to a one - way within - subjects ANOVA for all participants using a ran - dom - effect model . In order to detect changes in the hemo - dynamic response that exclusively can be ascribed to chunk decomposition , a t - contrast with linearly increasing weights { − 3 − 1 1 3 } throughout the baseline and the 3 decomposition con - ditions was performed to look for linear increases in activation across the 4 experimental conditions . A positive activation would reveal a linear increase throughout the 3 conditions , whereas a negative activation then simply refers to a linear decrease as a function of the different condition . For the whole - brain exploratorysearch , the initial threshold of t - maps resulting from a one - way ANOVA was set to P < 0 . 001 ( uncorrected ) with a spatial extent of more than 50 voxels . No voxel - based correction was employed , but we adopted a cluster - level family wise error ( FWE ) correction in that only clusters signi ﬁ cant at P < 0 . 05 FWE - corrected are reported . Results Behavioral Results Overall behavioral performance ( accuracy and mean reaction times ) for the baseline and decomposition conditions are shown in Table 1 . Repeated - measures analyses of variance ( ANOVA ) showed highly signi ﬁ cant effects on both dependent variables : accuracy , F 3 , 63 = 29 . 28 , P < 0 . 001 ; response times , F 3 , 63 = 171 . 87 , P < 0 . 001 . Pairwise comparisons ( Bonferroni corrected ) demonstrated statistically signi ﬁ cant differences in accuracy and response times for chunk tightness increments , that is , loose versus intermediate ( accuracy , P = 0 . 007 ; response times , P < 0 . 001 ) , and intermediate versus tight ( accuracy , P < 0 . 001 ; re - sponse times , P < 0 . 001 ) . The predicted difference in accuracy between baseline and loose chunk condition failed to reach statistical signi ﬁ cance ( P = 0 . 525 ) but the response time of base - line condition was signi ﬁ cantly less than that of loose chunk condition ( P < 0 . 001 ) . Brain Imaging Results To assess the effect of chunk decomposition , fMRI data were en - tered in a random - effects analysis using a one - way within - sub - ject ANOVA . A t - contrast with linearly increasing weights was usedtorevealbrainareasthatshowedlinearparametricBOLDre - sponses to increasing chunk tightness during decomposition . Positively signi ﬁ cant parametric activations to increasing tight - ness ( tight > intermediate > loose > baseline ) were found in the right inferior frontal gyrus ( BA44 / 47 ) , bilateral inferior / middle frontal gyrus ( BA9 / 46 ) , bilateral middle / superior frontal gyrus ( BA6 ) , bilateral medial frontal gyrus ( BA8 ) , caudate , bilateral pos - teriorparietalcortex ( BA7 / 40 ) , andbilateralsuperioroccipitalcor - tex ( BA19 ) ( Fig . 2 A ) . Tomaintainconsistencyofanatomicalterms , medial frontal gyrus ( BA8 ) is referred to as presupplementary motor area ( pre - SMA , Fig . 2 C ) and middle / superior frontal gyrus ( BA6 ) is referred to as IFJ ( Fig . 2 B ) , corresponding to the termin - ology by Derrfuss et al . ( 2005 ) in a meta - analysis of task - switch - ing and Stroop studies . Activations negatively associated with tightness ( tight < intermediate < loose < baseline ) were revealed in the posterior cingulate cortex ( BA31 / 23 ) , cuneus , precuneus , bilateral lingual gyrus , bilateral superior occipital gyrus ( BA18 / 19 ) , bilateral fusiform gyrus , bilateral middle superior temporal gyrus ( BA21 / 22 ) , bilateral angular gyrus ( BA39 ) , and bilateral supramarginal gyrus ( SMG ) ( BA40 ) ( Fig . 2 A ) . Anatomical labeling in statistical maps of interest were reported by the xjView Toolbox for SPM ( http : / / www . alivelearn . net / xjview ) ( Tables 2 and 3 ) . Discussion Combining a chunk decomposition task with Chinese characters and a parametric approach of fMRI , we aimed to detect brain re - gions speci ﬁ cally involved in chunk decomposition . As to the fMRI result , we observed widely distributed positive activations in response to chunk tightness during decomposition in frontal , parietal , and occipital cortex and associated negative activations in parietal and visual areas . Speci ﬁ cally , the positive activation map included DLPFC , presupplementary motor area ( pre - SMA ) , dPMC , IFJ , anterior insular cortex ( AIC ) , caudate , and posterior parietal cortex ( PPC ) . On the basis of the expected results , we sketched a preliminary model of chunk decomposition that de - ﬁ nes the functional role played by each region . The model sug - gests that the decomposition of an existing chunk activates the right lateral PFC in order to inhibit the predominant chunk repre - sentations ; the presupplementary motorareamay then initiate a transition fromthe inappropriatemental task representationto a new one , while IFJ servesto establish atask set during orafter the manipulation in the posterior parietal lobule , while being in - volved in the mental manipulation of the chunk components . Moreover , the caudate is , within this model , responsible for the selection and evaluation of the proposed solution . Our behavioral analysis revealed signi ﬁ cant effects , which showed that participants made signi ﬁ cantly more errors when Table 1 Behavioral performance ( Mean±SD ) Condition Percentage correct Reaction time ( ms ) Baseline 97 . 42±5 . 24 864 . 42±194 . 26 Easy 96 . 97±7 . 90 1222 . 02±246 . 08 Intermediate 94 . 39±7 . 08 1844 . 68±408 . 18 Hard 86 . 21±11 . 09 2765 . 27±686 . 24 SD represents standard deviation . 2994 | Cerebral Cortex , 2016 , Vol . 26 , No . 7 a t U n i v e r s it ae t s b i b li o t h e k d e r L M U M u e n c h e n on J un e 10 , 2016 h tt p : / / ce r c o r . ox f o r d j ou r n a l s . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m the tightnessofcharacters increases and theyspent moretime to decompose tighter chunks , which replicated the results of previous reports ( Knoblich et al . 1999 ; Luo et al . 2006 ; Wu et al . 2013 ) . In the present study , participants had been cued how to decompose the chunk and would therefore follow a prede ﬁ ned task instruction , thus excluding the potential confounding factor of searching for variable solutions to break up chunks ( as in Knoblich et al . 1999 ) . Consequently , our results directly demon - strated the linear relationship between chunk tightness and response times . Brain activations in visual cortex and parietal lobule have demonstrated its indispensable role in chunk decomposition . However , further evidence would be required to clearly specify their involvement in the respective cognitive processes . Luo et al . ( 2006 ) reported a deactivation of early visual cortex and a concurrent activation of higher visual cortex , whereas Wu et al . ( 2013 ) demonstrated that overcoming chunk tightness required visual - spatial processing in bilateral parietal lobes . In the current study , we administered a parametric design to address brain areas speci ﬁ cally involved in chunk decomposition . Although there were discrepancies between experimental paradigms , the present results corroborate main previous ﬁ ndings , especially those in posterior brain regions like parietal and visual cortices . Moreover , thepresentresearchfurtherspreviousrelevantstudies by identifying brain areas that reveal signi ﬁ cant negative activa - tions to chunk tightness , for instance in bilateral inferior parietal cortex and superior temporal gyrus . In consideration of the positive activation in superior parietal cortex and alongside with a negative activation in inferior par - ietal cortex , we suggest that the posterior parietal cortex may be involved in the coordination of chunk decomposition . The posterior parietal cortex may in turn support element restructur - ing of old chunks in an alternative way , which was modulated by the frontal cortex . Research in the ﬁ eld of attention has shown that superior parietal lobe ( SPL ) regions are involved in goal - directed attentional orienting , whereas inferior parietal lobe regions are involved in stimulus - driven attentional orienting ( Corbetta and Shulman 2002 ) . Using transcranial magnetic stimulation techniques in a categorical syllogistic reasoning task , Tsujii et al . ( 2011 ) found that bilateral SPL ( BA 7 ) stimulation impaired abstract and incongruent reasoning performance while congruent reasoning performance remained intact , which sug - gests that bilateral SPL may correspond to the analytic system of dual - process theory of reasoning . Moreover , patients with su - perior parietal damage have reliably shown de ﬁ cits on the ma - nipulation of information in working memory but not on rehearsal processes of working memory ( Koenigs et al . 2009 ) . We therefore suggest that SPL serves to mentally recombine chunk components during chunk decomposition and as such shows a parametric increase in activation with the gradual tight - ness of chunks . The deactivation observed in bilateral ventral parietal gyri , which was more robust in the right hemisphere , was not ad - dressed in previous relevant studies . Shulman and colleagues have found in a monitoring task that right SMG became deacti - vated when distracter objects appeared and re - activated once the target was detected . The authors propose that this deac - tivation was associated with ﬁ ltering of irrelevant inputs from temporal – parietal junction ( Shulman et al . 2007 ) . For the same reason , Shulman et al . ( 2007 ) hypothesized that a larger degree of deactivation to distracters should be observable when a sub - sequent target was detected rather than missed , and brain responses in right ventral parietal gyrus con ﬁ rmed this predic - tion . In the present experiment , participants were required to mentally restructure chunk components , and the deactivation observed in bilateral ventral parietal gyri may re ﬂ ect ﬁ ltering of distracting information in bottom - up attention networks ( Corbetta and Shulman 2002 ) . Furthermore , the complexity of mental transformations , which would correspond to the tight - ness of chunks , will increase the need to prevent irrelevant solu - tions from being attended . From our point of view , the suppression of stimulus - driven attentional orienting could best explain the parametric deactivation in bilateral ventral parietal gyri , especially in right SMG . In a similar vein , early visual cortex Figure 2 . Overall linear effects of increasing chunk tightness .

Besides , the re - mainingnegativelyactivatedareas including the posteriorcingu - late cortex , Precuneus and bilateral parietal cortex are posterior parts of the default mode network , which are shown to be deac - tivated during goal - oriented activity ( Buckner et al . 2008 ; Zhang and Chiang - shan 2012 ; Horn et al . 2014 ) . As hypothesized , chunk decomposition may include compo - nents that relate to the inhibition of inappropriate prepotent re - presentations , the establishment of a new mental representation andarestructurationoftheelementsinanalternativeway . Inthe following , we will discuss the functional roles of each activated area during the process of chunk decomposition . In order to break up existing chunks , participants had to over - ride prepotent representationsthrough inhibition , which was ac - complished by right lateral PFC , including inferior / middle frontal gyrus ( BA9 / 46 ) . According to the dual - process model of reason - ing , right mid - dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( mid - DLPFC ) serves to inhibit the dominant heuristic system in order to perform logic tasks with the analytic system when there is a con ﬂ ict between the heuristic and the analytic system ( Evans 2003 ) . Goel et al . ( 2009 ) have also demonstrated that the right mid - DLPFC ( x = 53 , y = 28 , z = 23 in Talairach coordinates ) is more active when participants were required to overcome a heuristic system . As to right inferior frontal gyrus , our ﬁ ndings are highly consistent with its role in inhibitory control ( Bunge et al . 2002 ; Aronet al . 2004 ; Buchsbaum et al . 2005 ) . Forinstance , patientstud - ies showed thatlesions in rightinferior frontal cortex leadtoadef - icit of response inhibition in a stop - signal task ( Aron et al . 2003 ) . Therefore , the right lateral PFC activity con ﬁ rmed our hypothesis about how to override the existing representations . Activation of the right lateral PFC may contribute to the suppression of semantic inference upon old chunks . However , inhibition does not guarantee the transition from an inappropriate mental task set to a novel one . To mentally break up a chunk , participants must know when and how to adopt an alternativeroutinetocombineinformation . Duringtheprocessof chunk decomposition , the transition was triggered not by ex - ogenous cues but by the endogenous awareness of a context change , which is a de ﬁ ning feature of proactive switching ( Hiko - saka and Isoda 2010 ) . Hikosaka and Isoda ( 2010 ) suggested that this particular function is speci ﬁ cally represented in the presup - plementary motor area ( pre - SMA ) . Rushworth et al . ( 2002 ) have shown that a larger BOLD signal was evoked in the pre - SMA re - gion in response to cuesthat indicated to switch when compared with maintain response rules in subsequent trials . To further determine the functional role of the pre - SMA in task - switching , repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation pulses were ad - ministered to these regions and the stimulation disrupted per - formance only on switch trials . These results suggest that the pre - SMA generates switch - related signals whenever needed and thus enables participants to initiate an alternative way of combining information . Subsequent to the relaxation of current constraints over ex - isting chunks , we predicted that brain regions consistently in - volved in set - shifting should show greater activity in response to switching dif ﬁ culty as introduced by the tightness of chunks . Among the activated brain regions , the IFJ , which is interpreted as a major neural component of the cognitive control network , was mostoften involved in the switching process ( Brass and von Cramon 2002 ; Brass et al . 2005 ; Derrfuss et al . 2005 ) . Derrfuss et al . ( 2005 ) conducted a meta - analysis on task - switching and Stroop studies and found that the IFJ was commonly activated in a within - subject investigation of these tasks . In task - switch - ing paradigms , participants typically alternate between 2 differ - ent tasks , and in the Stroop task participants have to inhibit dominant but irrelevant task representations to implement Table 2 Brain areas positively correlated to chunk tightness Anatomical areas BA Cluster size Talairach coordinates t value X Y Z R . precuneus 7 878 21 − 56 55 8 . 38 R . inferior parietal lobule 40 45 − 30 43 6 . 81 R . postcentral gyrus 2 59 − 21 45 5 . 66 R . inferior frontal gyrus 44 413 50 10 22 7 . 62 R . middle frontal gyrus 46 53 33 23 4 . 74 R . middle frontal gyrus 46 45 36 15 4 . 62 R . subgyral 6 194 24 6 52 6 . 45 R . middle frontal gyrus 6 27 − 4 44 6 . 24 L . precuneus 7 518 − 18 − 62 50 6 . 45 L . precuneus 19 − 27 − 71 34 5 . 01 L . inferior parietal lobule 40 − 33 − 33 38 4 . 57 R . caudate 328 6 9 2 6 . 36 L . caudate − 9 12 5 5 . 86 L . caudate − 9 1 17 4 . 57 L . middle frontal gyrus 6 510 − 21 − 3 47 6 . 21 L . medial frontal gyrus 8 0 34 40 6 . 15 L . superior frontal gyrus 6 − 24 11 52 5 . 99 R . inferior frontal gyrus 47 110 33 26 − 4 5 . 68 R . inferior frontal gyrus 47 27 23 − 11 4 . 47 R . middle frontal gyrus 11 30 34 − 17 4 . 22 L . inferior frontal gyrus 9 536 − 48 1 25 5 . 57 L . middle frontal gyrus 9 − 50 22 29 5 . 44 L . inferior frontal gyrus 46 − 50 44 1 4 . 31 L , left ; R , right ; BA , Brodmann ’ s area . 2996 | Cerebral Cortex , 2016 , Vol . 26 , No . 7 a t U n i v e r s it ae t s b i b li o t h e k d e r L M U M u e n c h e n on J un e 10 , 2016 h tt p : / / ce r c o r . ox f o r d j ou r n a l s . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m nondominant but relevant task representations . Considering the commonalities between task - switching paradigms and the Stroop task , the authors conclude that a conceptual cognitive process underlying the cognitive control paradigms is the up - date of task representations , which are associated with the IFJ . In the present study , the decomposition of tight relative to loose chunks requires the removal of unfamiliar elements in an unpredictable fashion , which would inevitably lead to a lar - ger switching effort that scales with the number of attempts . Thus , the switching effort may re ﬂ ect the gradual tightness of the chunk that needs to be decomposed and will also result in parametric activation of the IFJ in addition to the presupple - mentary motor area . Of particular interests in the present study was a subcortical region , the caudate , which is connected to frontal loberegionsre - sponsible for executive functions , such as the DLPFC , rostral an - terior cingulate , inferior frontal gyri , and presupplementary motor area ( Lehéricy et al . 2004 ; Postuma and Dagher 2006 ) . We would speculate that the caudate plays an important role in the selection and evaluation of alternative solutions , which may be a key feature that differentiates insightful chunk decomposition from general cognitive tasks . Although caudate activity was not observed in common set - shifting tasks which mostly show acti - vations in the cognitive control network , a study with Parkinson patients has demonstrated de ﬁ cits in switching motor or cogni - tive behaviors ( Cools et al . 2001 ) . Monchi et al . ( 2006 ) have also shown that the caudate nucleus is particularly important in a set - shifting task when a novel rule needs to be established with - out indications . A reasonable inference could therefore be that the caudate was indispensable in set - shifting tasks only when a novel rule needed to be established . This is the case with chunk decomposition in that the unpredictability of how to decompose tighter chunks is proportional to the novelty of the solution . This would explain the parametric activation of the caudate in response to chunk tightness as revealed here . In a recentstudy , weintendedtofurtherspecifythefeatureofnovelty in chunk decomposition ( i . e . , the contrast between novel vs . familiar ways of decomposition ) , which generally involved func - tional areas for procedural memory ( caudate ) , for mental reward ( substantia nigra ) , and for visual - spatial processing ( Huang et al . 2015 ) . Furthermore , Segerand Cincotta ( 2005 ) have found that ac - tivity in the head of the caudate is associated most strongly with feedbackprocessing , whichdecreasesacrosstrials . Inthepresent experiment , we did not provide feedback to participants but we presented them with correct solutions of how to decompose chunks they have never seen before . During chunk decompos - ition , participants had to reconstruct the elements in an alterna - tive way , which re ﬂ ects unusual or novel solutions to a problem , especially when insight is required . We have tentatively discussed the speci ﬁ c role of the acti - vatedareasoverlappedwiththecognitivecontrolnetworkduring chunk decomposition , but dPMC and insular areas were not cov - ered in the present discussion . Note that , in the present study , the key idea for chunk decomposition was not generated by par - ticipants themselves but was de ﬁ ned beforehand . Although spontaneous idea generation is in principle important , it is not well suited for neuroimaging research especially for an event - related design , which requires clearly de ﬁ ned mental events and accurate onset times ( Luo and Knoblich 2007 ) . Therefore , the use of cues during chunk decomposition was employed in the present study , since a lack of the generative task component may be compensated by tight control of key cognitive com - ponents and reliable data extraction . Moreover , studies on self - generated chunk decomposition ( Wu et al . 2009 ) con ﬁ rmed the major observation made by the externally cued decomposi - tion ( Luo et al . 2006 ) . Therefore , the results obtained from the ex - ternally cued chunk decomposition could also be partially applicable to variants of self - generated decomposition , Table 3 Brain areas negatively correlated to chunk tightness Anatomical areas BA Cluster size Talairach coordinates t value X Y Z L . postcentral gyrus 3 412 − 50 − 15 50 7 . 58 L . precentral gyrus 4 − 36 − 21 48 7 . 43 L . precentral gyrus 4 − 36 − 20 62 6 . 24 R . supramarginal gyrus 40 1120 59 − 56 36 7 . 27 R . superior temporal gyrus 39 45 − 51 30 6 . 04 R . supramarginal gyrus 40 62 − 48 25 5 . 32 L . insula 13 654 − 50 − 22 20 6 . 77 L . precentral gyrus 6 − 48 − 2 8 6 . 07 L . inferior parietal lobule 40 − 50 − 31 24 4 . 87 R . culmen 349 18 − 50 − 13 6 . 42 R . lingual gyrus 19 15 − 61 1 4 . 16 R . lingual gyrus 19 24 − 73 − 6 3 . 95 L . medial frontal gyrus 6 1709 − 6 − 3 50 6 . 12 L . cuneus 18 − 12 − 83 21 5 . 85 R . cuneus 18 12 − 80 23 5 . 72 L . inferior parietal lobule 39 222 − 50 − 65 39 5 . 66 L . supramarginal gyrus 40 − 56 − 60 31 4 . 91 R . precentral gyrus 44 187 48 1 11 5 . 44 R . claustrum 27 9 11 4 . 30 R . insula 13 39 9 8 4 . 25 L . lingual gyrus 19 176 − 18 − 61 − 2 4 . 67 L . lingual gyrus − 15 − 76 − 1 4 . 52 L , left ; R , right ; BA , Brodmann ’ s area .
