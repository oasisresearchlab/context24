Methods : Data Sources : We searched MEDLINE , OVID Epub and EMBASE for published literature up to February 5 , 2021 . Study eligibility criteria : Studies including at least 50 patients with COVID - 19 in any healthcare setting . Assessment of risk of Bias : We used a validated 10 - item risk of bias tool for disease prevalence Methods of data synthesis : The main outcome of interest was the proportion of COVID - 19 patients with bloodstream and / or respiratory bacterial co - infection and secondary infection . We performed meta - regression to identify study population factors associated with bacterial infection including healthcare setting , age , comorbidities and COVID - 19 medication . Results : Out of 33 , 345 studies screened , 171 were included in the final analysis . Bacterial infection data were available from 171 , 262 patients . The prevalence of co - infection was 5 . 1 % ( 95 % CI : 3 . 6 % to 7 . 1 % ) and secondary infection was 13 . 1 % ( 95 % CI : 9 . 8 % to 17 . 2 % ) . There was a higher odds of bacterial infection in studies with a higher proportion of patients in the intensive care unit ( ICU ) ( adjusted OR 18 . 8 , 95 % CI : 6 . 5 to 54 . 8 ) . Female sex was associated with a lower odds of secondary infection ( adjusted OR 0 . 73 , 95 % CI : 0 . 55 to 0 . 97 ) but not co - infection ( adjusted OR 1 . 05 , 95 % CI : 0 . 80 to 1 . 37 ) . The most common organisms isolated included Staphylococcus aureus , coagulase - negative Staphylococci , and Klebsiella species . Conclusions : While the odds of respiratory and bloodstream bacterial infection are low in patients with COVID - 19 , meta - regression revealed potential risk factors for infection , including ICU setting and mechanical ventilation . The risk for secondary infection is substantially greater than the risk for co - infection in patients with COVID - 19 . Understanding predictors of co - infection and secondary infection may help to support improved antibiotic stewardship in patients with COVID - 19 . Registration : PROSPERO ( ID CRD42021241098 ) . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 3 Introduction There is rising concern about the long - term impact of COVID - 19 on antimicrobial resistance . While bacterial co - infection rates in patients presenting with COVID - 19 have been found to be low ( < 5 % ) ( 1 , 2 ) , the majority ( 50 - 75 % ) of hospitalized patients with COVID - 19 receive antibiotics ( 3 , 4 ) . The rates of secondary bacterial infection , those that occur later on in illness , tend to be higher ( 10 - 20 % ) , but are typically related to healthcare - associated infections involving invasive devices , such as ventilators and central venous access ( 1 , 5 , 6 ) . There are limited data describing the causative pathogens and their susceptibility patterns among COVID - 19 patients with bacterial co - infections . Despite the low rate of infection early in illness , a large observational study found that 57 % of patients with COVID - 19 received early empiric antibiotics and 46 % of these patients had their antibiotics continued after a positive COVID - 19 PCR test . Of those who had antibiotics continued despite no confirmed bacterial infection , 64 % had antibiotics continued for five or more days ( 3 ) . The vast discrepancy between the rate of proven bacterial infection and antibiotic use suggests an urgent need for antimicrobial stewardship . However , there are several diagnostic challenges that drive antibiotic overuse in COVID - 19 , most notably the difficulties in 1 ) differentiating viral from bacterial infection prior to the COVID - 19 test result , and 2 ) definitively ruling out bacterial co - infection in those after a positive COVID - 19 test . A better understanding of the population - level predictors of bacterial co - infection and secondary infection can help identify situations where antibiotics are more likely to provide benefit , and uncover opportunities for antimicrobial stewardship . Additionally , a characterization of the common organisms identified in early versus late bacterial infection in a COVID - 19 patient may help clinicians optimize prescribing , particularly regarding when and which empiric treatment may be beneficial . As the standard of care for COVID - 19 infection evolved rapidly over the course of the pandemic , including the life - saving measures of respiratory support and use of immunotherapy based on emerging evidence , it was deemed important to update our analysis reflecting this change in practice . Our objective was to build J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 4 upon our previously published rapid review to describe the prevalence and microbiological characteristics of respiratory and bloodstream co - infection and secondary infection and to use meta - regression to identify study - level predictors of bacterial infections in patients with COVID - 19 . Methods We conducted a rapid systematic review guided by the Cochrane Rapid Reviews Methods Group ( 7 ) to evaluate concomitant bacterial infection in patients with COVID - 19 . We included studies of humans with COVID - 19 , across all healthcare settings ( i . e . , hospital , community , long - term care ) , and age groups ( pediatric and adult patients ) . We included cohort studies , case series with 50 or more patients and randomized controlled trials that did not evaluate antibiotic use as an intervention , but excluded reviews , editorials , letters , and case studies . We excluded studies that 1 ) included patients with non - laboratory - proven COVID - 19 , 2 ) tested for co - infection using only nasopharyngeal swabs , 3 ) did not differentiate between bacterial infection and other co - infections or secondary infections ( e . g . , fungal ) , 4 ) indicated bacterial infection was presumed or suspected ( e . g . , use of white blood cell count , biomarkers ) , and 5 ) used serology as a bacterial infection diagnostic approach . This protocol was registered under PROSPERO , the international registry of systematic reviews ( ID CRD42021241098 ) . Data Sources We performed systematic searches of MEDLINE , OVID Epub , and EMBASE databases for published literature in any language from January 1 , 2019 to February 5 , 2021 with assistance from a medical library information specialist . The expanded timeline aimed to capture new publication since the systematic search we performed for our earlier review ( January 1 , 2019 to April 16 , 2020 ) ( 8 ) . The current search was structured to include COVID - 19 terms co - infection , bacterial infection , respiratory infection , epidemiology , or descriptive cohort study terms . The complete search strategy is described in the Online Supplement . The results of the search were J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 5 imported into Covidence ( Covidence , Melbourne , Australia ) , an online software tool for systematic reviews . Duplicate records were removed using Covidence . Study Selection Initial screening of titles and abstracts from the search were shared by two authors ( BL or VL ) , who independently identified studies that met all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria . All full text studies meeting initial criteria were then reviewed by one of the authors ( BL , MS , VL , SR , TK , JL , or DM ) for final inclusion in the rapid review . Single screening was utilized given the high volume of citations and the substantial kappa agreement ( 0 . 62 to 0 . 68 ) from our team for previous rapid reviews in which duplicate screening was performed ( 9 ) . Data Extraction One of seven authors ( BL , MS , VL , SR , TK , JL , or DM ) independently extracted data from included studies using a standardized data collection form . For quality assurance , one of three authors ( FL , VL or BL ) then verified all extracted data to confirm accuracy and completeness . We collected data on the following variables for demographics and setting : author ; country of study ; start and end dates ; study design ; healthcare setting ( inpatient ICU vs . non ICU , outpatient ) ; sample size ; age group ; patient population ; mean or median age ; and number of female patients . Regarding clinical characteristics , we collected information on COVID - 19 severity ; number of patients requiring mechanical ventilation ; number of patients that were smokers ; number of patients with comorbidities ( chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , cardiovascular disease , or diabetes ) ; and number of patients who were prescribed corticosteroids , interleukin - 6 ( IL - 6 ) inhibitors ( i . e . , tocilizumab or sarilumab ) , and antibacterial agents . We extracted respiratory and bloodstream microbiology data , including specimen source and identification , if the information was available . Assessment of Bias We used a validated 10 - item risk of bias tool for disease prevalence ( 10 ) . Risk of bias was categorized as low ( score ≥ 8 ) , moderate ( score 5 - 7 ) , or high ( score 0 - 4 ) . A sensitivity analysis J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 6 was performed stratifying proportion of bacterial infection by study risk of bias . Additional sensitivity analyses were performed to 1 ) remove studies where bacteriological testing method and bacterial infection source were not specified and 2 ) to stratify studies based on whether they used a clinical definition for bacterial infection ( e . g . , differentiated infection from colonization or contamination using clinical criteria ) . Data Synthesis The main outcome of interest was the overall prevalence of respiratory and bloodstream bacterial co - infection or secondary infection among patients with COVID - 19 . We evaluated the number of patients developing a bacterial infection at any point during the course of their illness while under study observation as a proportion of all patients with COVID - 19 . First , studies were categorized based on whether they evaluated co - infection ( authors used the term co - infection and / or specified that infection was assessed on admission or at the time of health care visit ) , secondary infection ( authors used the term secondary infection , super - infection , healthcare - associated infection , and / or indicated that infection was identified > 48 hours after initial assessment ) . Studies that did not specify co - infection or secondary infection were grouped with co - infection . To estimate overall bacterial infection , for studies reporting both co - infection and secondary infection , we selected the higher proportion of the two . Second , the source of infection was categorized as respiratory , bloodstream , both respiratory and bloodstream , or not specified . Infections specified from other sources ( e . g . , urine , skin ) were not included . For the purposes of this study , both co - infection and secondary infection were limited to respiratory and / or bloodstream specimens to estimate the prevalence of infections closely linked to COVID - 19 while limiting bias due to variability in diagnosis of other less relevant conditions ( e . g . , skin and soft tissue infections and urinary tract infections ) . Third , studies were categorized based on the bacteriological testing method ( culture , nucleic acid amplification , a combination of approaches , or not specified ) . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 7 We pooled proportion data across studies via a random - effects meta - analysis using a generalized linear mixed model ( GLMM ) with logit link approach ( 11 , 12 ) . Results were illustrated using forest plots stratified by healthcare setting and infection type . Heterogeneity was assessed by I 2 statistic ( 13 ) . All analyses were carried out using R version 4 . 1 . 1 with the packages metafor and meta . The statistical code for this analysis is made available online ( 14 ) . Meta - regression To predict the effect of specific population - level variables on bacterial infection , we performed univariable meta - regression evaluating patient characteristics ( age , sex , comorbidities , use of medication for treatment of COVID - 19 ) , markers of severity ( e . g . , mechanical ventilation ) , healthcare setting , geographic region ( Asia , Middle East , Europe , North America , South America ) , and end - month of study . Differences in prevalence of antibiotic prescribing for each variable were described in terms of the prevalence odds ratio ( OR ) compared to reference , per 10 % increase for continuous variables and per 10 year increase for age . Multi - variable meta - regression was then performed to account for key factors mediating the risk of infection including mean / median patient age ( 15 ) and severity of COVID - 19 ( an index including the highest value of : % of patients with ARDS ; % of ICU patients ; % of mechanical ventilation patients ) ( 16 ) . One model per variable was constructed , and only studies where both the variable of interest and the adjustment variables were reported were included . We used the same subset of studies with available data for both the unadjusted and adjusted analyses . Given studies that did not report whether they evaluated co - infection vs . secondary infection were grouped with co - infection , a sensitivity analysis was performed to remove these studies with unspecified outcome to determine the robustness of our findings . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 8 Results Of 56 , 767 studies identified via searching , after duplicate removal , we reviewed a total of 33 , 345 studies via title and abstract screening , 1 , 798 of which were assessed via full - text screening . We included 171 studies in the final analysis ( 3 , 17 – 185 ) ( Figure 1 ) . Study design was primarily retrospective in nature ( n = 149 ) , with fewer prospective cohorts ( n = 19 ) , or randomized controlled trials ( n = 3 ) . COVID - 19 study data was collected from December 2019 to October 2020 . Study Geography The majority of studies took place in Europe ( 67 , 39 % ) , followed by Asia ( 55 , 32 % ) , North America ( 34 , 20 % ) , Middle East ( 10 , 6 % ) , South and Central America ( 3 , 2 % ) , and multiple regions ( 2 , 1 % ) . Healthcare Setting Most studies took place in a general hospital setting ( 129 , 75 % ) , followed by only intensive care unit ( ICU ) patients ( 33 , 19 % ) , mixed hospitalized patients and outpatients ( 9 , 5 % ) , and a single study limited to outpatients ( 1 , 1 % ) . Patient Characteristics A total of 171 , 262 patients were evaluated for bacterial infection across the 171 studies . A median 41 % of participants were female ( interquartile range ( IQR ) 33 to 48 % ) . The median age was 61 years ( IQR 53 to 64 , range 5 to 85 ) . Only four studies included a population with a median age less than 18 years . Studies included a median of 25 % ICU patients ( IQR 13 to 100 % ) and a median of 21 % ( IQR 10 to 52 % ) patients receiving mechanical ventilation . Smokers comprised a median of 9 % ( IQR 5 to 22 % ) of the study populations . Common comorbidities included chronic respiratory disease ( median 6 % , IQR 4 to 12 % ) , cardiovascular disease ( median 14 % , IQR 6 to 20 % ) , and diabetes ( median 21 % , IQR 12 to 32 % ) . Bacterial Infection Assessment in COVID - 19 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 9 Most studies did not specify how bacterial infection was detected ( 82 , 48 % ) , followed by studies using culture methods ( 72 , 42 % ) , combined approach using culture with nucleic acid amplification and / or urinary antigen testing ( 16 , 9 % ) , and nucleic acid amplification alone ( 1 , 1 % ) . Sources assessed for infection included a combination of respiratory and bloodstream isolates ( 75 , 44 % ) , respiratory only ( 38 , 22 % ) , blood only ( 22 , 13 % ) , and unclear site of infection ( 35 , 20 % ) . The minority of studies ( 66 , 39 % ) employed a clinical definition for diagnosis of bacterial infection . A total of 86 studies ( 59 explicitly used co - infection terminology , and 27 not specified ) including 137 , 325 patients evaluated for co - infection , and 95 studies including 40 , 843 patients evaluated for secondary infection . This includes ten studies that assessed patients for both co - infection and secondary infection . Microbiological Characteristics of Bacterial Infections in COVID - 19 A total of 76 studies specified organism identification for bacterial infections ( co - infections n = 1 , 319 and secondary infections n = 2 , 016 ) . For co - infections , the most common bacterial organisms identified included Staphylococcus aureus ( S . aureus ) ( 332 , 25 % ) , coagulase - negative Staphylococcus ( CNST ) ( 217 , 16 % ) , and Klebsiella species ( 113 , 9 % ) . For secondary infections , identified organisms were more diverse but the most common organisms were similar including S . aureus ( 315 , 16 % ) and Klebsiella species ( 233 , 11 % ) . Figure 2 contains complete details for all organisms identified . Prevalence of Bacterial Infection in Patients with COVID - 19 When pooling bacterial infection across all 171 , 262 patients with COVID - 19 , the prevalence of overall respiratory and / or bloodstream bacterial infection was 8 . 8 % ( 95 % CI : 6 . 9 to 11 . 1 % ) . Bacterial co - infection occurred in 5 . 1 % ( 95 % CI : 3 . 6 to 7 . 1 % ) of patients and increased with the level or intensity of care , from mixed hospital / outpatient populations ( 1 . 9 % , 95 % CI : 0 . 5 to 7 . 1 % ) , to hospitalized patients ( 4 . 4 % , 95 % CI : 3 . 0 to 6 . 4 % ) , to intensive care only ( 15 . 4 % , 95 % CI : 10 . 5 to 22 . 0 % ) . Secondary bacterial infection was more common at 13 . 1 % ( 95 % CI : 9 . 8 % to 17 . 2 % ) . While mixed hospital / outpatient populations ( 11 . 1 % , 95 % CI : 1 . 4 to 52 . 3 % ) and hospitalized populations ( 8 . 2 % , 95 % CI : 6 . 3 to 10 . 7 % ) experienced a lower risk of secondary infection , secondary bacterial infection was more common in ICU populations ( 41 . 9 % , 95 % CI : J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 10 29 . 5 to 55 . 4 ) . The degree of heterogeneity in the prevalence of bacterial co - infection and secondary infection was substantial ( I 2 = 98 % ) . See Figure 2 . The prevalence of bacterial infection differed depending on the site of infection reported : respiratory and blood isolates ( co - infection 6 . 2 % , 95 % CI : 3 . 6 to 10 . 5 % ; secondary infection : 16 . 3 % , 11 . 9 to 22 . 0 % ) , blood alone ( co - infection 6 . 0 % , 95 % CI 3 . 4 to 10 . 3 % ; secondary infection : 10 . 7 % , 95 % CI 3 . 4 to 28 . 8 % ) , and respiratory isolates alone ( co - infection 2 . 9 % , 95 % CI 1 . 6 to 4 . 9 % ; secondary infection 12 . 2 % , 95 % CI : 4 . 9 to 27 . 1 % ) . See Figure 3 . Meta - Regression - Predictors of Co - Infection and Secondary Infection in COVID - 19 COVID - 19 co - infection rates were higher in studies with a higher proportion of ICU patients ( adjusted OR 6 . 96 , 95 % CI : 2 . 14 to 22 . 65 ) and secondary infection ( adjusted OR 32 . 10 , 95 % CI : 2 . 66 to 387 . 30 ) compared to those not admitted to an ICU . Studies with a higher proportion of mechanically ventilated patients were associated with a greater odds of both co - infection ( adjusted OR 1 . 24 , 95 % CI : 1 . 11 to 1 . 40 ) and secondary infection ( adjusted OR 1 . 44 , 95 % CI : 1 . 32 to 1 . 57 ) . Advanced study population age did not appear to be associated with a greater odds of co - infection ( adjusted OR 1 . 06 , 95 % CI : 0 . 87 to 1 . 28 per 10 year increase ) or secondary infection ( adjusted OR 1 . 24 , 95 % CI : 0 . 93 to 1 . 66 per 10 year increase ) . Higher proportion of female patients appeared to be protective for secondary infection ( adjusted OR 0 . 73 , 95 % CI : 0 . 55 to 0 . 97 ) but not co - infection ( adjusted OR 1 . 05 , 95 % CI 0 . 80 to 1 . 37 ) . There was no association between the proportion of study corticosteroid use and bacterial infections ( co - infection : adjusted OR 1 . 07 , 95 % CI : 0 . 88 to 1 . 29 , secondary infection : adjusted OR 0 . 99 , 95 % CI : 0 . 87 to 1 . 12 ) or IL - 6 inhibitor use ( co - infection : adjusted OR 1 . 06 , 95 % CI 0 . 85 to 1 . 31 , secondary infection : adjusted OR 0 . 98 , 95 % CI : 0 . 87 to 1 . 10 ) and bacterial infection in patients with COVID - 19 . ( Table 1 ) . Sensitivity Analyses Although the overall estimate of bacterial infection was similar when stratified by study risk of bias , studies with a moderate risk of bias reported numerically higher rates of bacterial infections in ICU patients ( 44 . 2 % , 95 % CI 28 . 8 to 60 . 8 ) , compared to the same population in J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 11 studies with high ( 18 . 8 % , 95 % CI : 13 . 9 to 25 . 0 % ) and low risk of bias ( 24 . 5 % , 95 % CI : 15 . 2 % to 36 . 9 % ) ( Supplementary Figure 1 ) . However , this difference was not statistically significant upon meta - regression in either unadjusted or adjusted analyses . Studies with a high risk of bias had a greater odds of co - infection ( adjusted OR 2 . 45 , 95 % CI : 1 . 05 to 5 . 72 ) but not secondary infection ( adjusted OR 0 . 67 , 95 % CI : 0 . 26 to 1 . 71 ) ( Table 1 ) . Estimates of proportion of bacterial infection were similar when removing studies where bacteriological testing method and bacterial infection source were not specified ( Supplementary Figure 2 ) . Studies that employed a clinical definition for bacterial infection appeared to report similar prevalence of infection compared to those without this definition ( Supplementary Figure 3 ) . When removing studies that did not explicitly state whether they evaluated co - infection vs . secondary infection , the findings were similar , with one key exception . ICU setting did not appear to be associated with co - infection risk after removing these studies ( adjusted OR 3 . 61 95 % CI 0 . 46 to 28 . 36 ) ; however , the association between ICU setting and secondary infection risk persisted , adjusted OR 32 . 10 ( 95 % CI 2 . 66 to 387 . 30 ) . Antibiotic Prescribing in Patients with COVID - 19 Out of 31 , 802 patients evaluated for antibiotic prescribing , the prevalence of antibiotic use in patients with COVID - 19 was 76 . 2 % ( 95 % CI : 67 . 3 to 83 . 2 % ) . There did not appear to be an appreciable change in prescribing over time during the period January to September 2020 . There was substantial heterogeneity between studies in the prevalence of antibiotic prescribing ( I 2 = 99 % ) ( Supplementary Figure 4 ) . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 12 Discussion We previously conducted a rapid review / meta - analysis on the prevalence of bacterial co - infection and another on the antibiotic prescribing based on literature published in the first few months of the pandemic ( 1 , 4 ) . The current update included literature published up to the beginning of February 2021 — over a year since SARS - CoV - 2 was first identified . In this analysis , the pooled estimated prevalence of bacterial co - infection in 5 . 1 % , and increased with the severity of COVID - 19 infection . The prevalence of secondary infections was estimated to be 13 % , more than double that of co - infection . With meta - regression , this updated analysis provides a more comprehensive and granular picture on the predictors of bacterial infections in COVID - 19 while confirming our earlier findings . Furthermore , compared to pandemic influenza which has been associated with a risk of bacterial co - infection of at least 19 % ( 186 , 187 ) , the risks of bacterial co - infection and secondary infections from SARS - CoV - 2 appear to be lower . A series of pivotal studies established two classes of immunotherapy , systemic corticosteroids and IL - 6 inhibitors , as standards of care for patients with moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring hospitalization requiring respiratory support ( 188 – 191 ) . Given their immunomodulatory effects , concern has been raised regarding their role in secondary infections in COVID - 19 . Our analyses did not identify a significantly higher odds of secondary bacterial infections among patients exposed to corticosteroids or IL - 6 inhibitors . These findings may reflect the fact that other drivers , such as the inflammatory response to SARS - CoV - 2 and invasive devices , are more significant contributing factors of bacterial infections in patients with COVID - 19 ( 192 ) and as such there may be limited benefit of empiric antibiotics in the absence of proven infection for patients receiving these agents . Alternatively , our study may not be adequately powered to detect the impact of these immunomodulatory agents on secondary infections , given the relatively low rate of bacterial infection events . The most common organisms identified in patients with both co - infection and secondary infection are S . aureus , CNST , and Klebsiella species . These pathogens reflect those seen in hospital - acquired pneumonia and bloodstream infections also seen outside of the context of J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 13 COVID - 19 ( 193 , 194 ) . However , given most studies did not attempt to differentiate infection from contamination , CNST may represent contamination in many cases ( 174 ) . At 77 % , the prevalence of antibiotic prescribing was high and incongruent with the relatively low prevalence of bacterial infections . This outcome remained consistent with our previous publication ( 4 ) . Of note , clinical guidelines for COVID - 19 recommendations varied with respect to the use of empiric antibiotics , particularly in critically ill patients ( 195 – 198 ) . Differences in the recommended approach to antibiotic prescribing may explain why the use of antibiotics remained higher than prevalence of bacterial infections . Our findings support a more judicious approach , particularly in patients outside of the ICU . A limitation of this review is that these findings are constrained by the quality of the underlying primary literature , as less than one third of included studies were considered to be at low risk of bias . We also noted a high degree of heterogeneity across studies , of which it is not clear whether this reflects a difference in clinical characteristics , diagnostic approaches , and / or clinical practice across settings . However , our findings are relatively consistent across study risk of bias rating and align with those in recent large high - quality observational cohort studies ( 83 , 161 ) . A second limitation is our focus on microbiological identification of bacterial infection . There may be a risk of under - estimating the true prevalence of co - infection and secondary infection given that only a proportion of patients receive microbiological testing to confirm the presence of bacterial infection . On the other hand , a microbiological definition alone may overestimate infection in the setting of colonization without evidence of a true respiratory infection . Finally , the distinction between bacterial co - infection and secondary infection is not always consistent across the literature ( 199 ) . Terms may be used interchangeably or not at all , leading to a risk of misclassification bias . To address this risk , we reported both an estimate of co - infection and secondary infection , as well as overall bacterial infection , the latter of which reduces the impact of imprecision associated with terminology chosen by study authors . Over a year into the pandemic , these findings provide further supporting evidence for the relatively low rate of bacterial infection in COVID - 19 and may serve an impetus for J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 14 antimicrobial stewardship initiatives , such as risk stratification for early empiric antibiotics , and early discontinuation in patients with COVID - 19 and lack of confirmed concomitant bacterial infection . Conclusion While the odds of respiratory and bloodstream bacterial infection are low in patients with COVID - 19 , potential risk factors for infection include ICU setting and mechanical ventilation . The risk for secondary infection is substantially greater than the risk for co - infection in patients with COVID - 19 . Antibiotics appear to continue to be over - prescribed in COVID - 19 . Understanding predictors of co - infection and secondary infection may help to support improved antibiotic stewardship in patients with COVID - 19 .
