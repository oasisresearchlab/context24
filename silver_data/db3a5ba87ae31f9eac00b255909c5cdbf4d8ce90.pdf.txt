Structural aspects of talin regulation through Rap1A signalling Thesis submitted in accordance with the requirements of the University of Liverpool for the degree of Doctor in Philosophy by Thomas Zacharchenko - 200706092 – August 2013 . II Abstract At the nascent focal adhesion , GTPase Rap1A recruits the adaptor protein RIAM ( Rap1 Interacting Adaptor Molecule ) , and RIAM recruits the scaffold protein talin facilitating integrin activation ( Lee et al . , 2009 ) . As the nascent adhesion matures , actin linkages are strengthened via recruitment of the talin - actin bridging protein vinculin . In vivo data shows that RIAM is not found in mature focal adhesions ; furthermore RIAM and vinculin occupy the same binding sites within talin ( Goult et al . , 2013 ) . This thesis shows that RIAM - talin interaction is synergistic , with multiple domains simultaneously contributing to the binding . Vinculin and RIAM compete for talin , providing a mechanism of RIAM displacement by vinculin as adhesions mature . The interactions are thus characterised by a range biophysical techniques . SHARPIN ( Shank associated RH - domain interacting Protein ) potentially competes with talin for integrin binding ( Rantala et al . , 2011 ) . SHARPIN interaction with the synaptic protein SHANK3 ( SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains protein 3 ) may provide a mechanism for SHANK3 recruitment to the adhesion ( Lim et al . , 2001 ) . This thesis solves the structure of the SHANK N - terminal domain that contains the SHARPIN binding region . The structure shows the presence of a previously uncharacterised RA ( Ras - association ) domain that packs against the following ankyrin repeat domain . We show the RA domain binds with high affinity to the GTPase - Rap1A . Rap1A - SHANK could provide a negative feedback pathway for integrin regulation in adhesion . In the course of adhesion maturation multiple proteins are recruited to the adhesion complex ; these proteins facilitate linkages to the actomyosin contractile machinery . One such protein is DLC1 ( Deleted in Liver Cancer 1 ) ; DLC1 contains an LD - like motif that is homologues to the LD domains of the adhesion protein paxillin ( Brown et al . , 1996 ) . This LD - like motif is responsible for tumour suppressor function and binding to talin ( Li et al . , 2011 ; Cao et al . , 2012 ) . In this thesis we characterise the talin - DLC1 interaction using X - ray crystallography , and suggest mutations to disrupt the interaction in cell experiments . III Acknowledgements – I would like to thank Dr Igor Barsukov and Dr Daimark Bennett for giving me the opportunity to undertake this PhD . Dr Barsukov has provided continual advice and tutoring both in theoretical and practical aspects of NMR and ITC , as well as providing continual assistance throughout the thesis period . I would like to thank Dr Paul Elliott ; during the first two years of my studies Dr Elliott provided tutoring on all aspects of protein expression and macromolecular crystallography . There are several members of both Lab C and D that have provided continual support and advice . I would like to thank Dr Rob Gibson for providing advice on theoretical aspects of crystallography . I would like to thank Dr Olga Mayans , Dr Svetlana Antonyuk and Dr Richard Strange for assistance in data collection . Outside of the University of Liverpool I would like to thank Dr Ben Goult and Professor David Critchley , who have provided all of the talin and vinculin clones from a vast library available to the University of Leicester . Without these constructs much of the work in this thesis would have taken significantly longer to achieve . Thanks also to Dr Hans Kreinkamp of the University Hospital Hamburg - Eppendorf for providing the clones of SHANK3 . For those outside the lab I would like to thank my long - suffering friends and family who put up with me being stressed for most of the time . Lastly I would like to thank the BBSRC for funding this research .

196 1 Structural Aspects of focal adhesion dynamics 1 . 1 - Introduction The extracellular matrix ( ECM ) is essential for multicellular organisms . Cell - cell and cell - matrix adhesions represent some of the most highly conserved signallosomes . Focal adhesions are the focus of this thesis , and adhesion proteins have orthologues in organisms as primitive as sponges and slime mould ( Dictyostelium discoideum ) . This reflects the crucial role of cell - matrix adhesions in the evolution of multicellular organisms ( Hynes et al . , 2002 ; Cornillon et al . , 2006 ; Sebe - Pedros et al . , 2010 ) . The ECM directs cell migration by providing chemokines that dictate cellular differentiation , proliferation and migration . An example of such a mechanism exists in wound healing where secreted PDGF ( Platelet Derived Growth Factor ) guides fibroblast and epithelial cells for repair ( Pierce et al . , 1989 ) . Rap1A - GTPase is a downstream effector of PDGF and the NMDA ( N - methyl - d - aspartate ) receptor , and regulates focal adhesion formation ( Pierce et al . , 1989 ; La Fuente et al . , 2004 ) . The effector RIAM is a direct binding partner of GTPase - Rap1A , and is believed to regulate adhesions through the recruitment of the cytoskeletal scaffold talin ( Lee et al . , 2009 ) . Talin subsequently recruits vinculin to secure actin linkages , and later DLC1 ( Deleted in Liver Cancer 1 ) to negatively regulate Rho - GTPase function . Talin binding activates integrins ( Calderwood et al . , 2003 ) ; where as the SHANK3 binding protein SHARPIN inhibits activation ( Rantala et al . , 2011 ) . SHANK3 can be localised to the cell membrane ( Durand et al . , 2012 ) , and this recruitment is dependent on an unstructured N - terminal region ( 1 - 100 ) . Thus the purpose of this thesis is to structurally characterise this region , suggesting a method of SHARPIN membrane recruitment , by testing potential SHANK3 binding partners . 1 . 1 - Extracellular matrix The ECM is a composite of proteins and polysaccharides that contribute to the structure and function of tissues . There are three major classes of ECM component , the collagens , the proteoglycans ( e . g . heparin sulphate and perlecan ) and multi - adhesive matrix proteins such as fibronectin and laminin ( Geiger et al . , 2001 ) . Fibronectins are large ( 440kDa ) proteins that are responsible for multiple interactions . Fibronectins interact with collagens and proteoglycans , as well as the cell surface ecto - domain of integrin heterodimers ( Geiger et al . , 2001 ; Hynes et al . , 1987 ) . Matrix 2 composition varies with its location in the body and physiological function ; this tailors the matrix for specific roles ( Tanzer 2006 ) . Cues from the ECM are responsible for providing appropriate signals that help to regulate tissue specific function . Inhibition of type IV fibronectin using siRNA ( or anti - fibronectin and anti - integrin antibodies ) negatively attenuates cleft formation and branching in murine embryos ( Sakai et al . , 2003 ) . Conversely the application of exogenous fibronectin restores cleft formation in murine embryos ( Sakai et al . , 2003 ) . 1 . 2 - Cell - cell and cell - matrix junctions Cell - matrix junctions mediate the coupling between the actomyosin cytoskeleton and the ECM . Focal adhesions connect to the basal lamina , a specialised type of ECM secreted by epithelial cells that consists of laminin , fibronectin and perlecan . Focal adhesions function as lamellar signallosomes ( Kanchanwong et al . , 2010 ) that link the extracellular matrix with the actin dynamics and cellular morphology . Actomyosin cytoskeleton indirectly couples to the ECM through integrins within the cell membrane and the adaptor protein talin in the cytosol ( Burridge 1983 ) . The talin - integrin complex provides a platform for the subsequent recruitment of other signalling proteins , including actin interacting protein vinculin and Rho - GAP DLC1 . Proteins that indirectly regulate actin dynamics may also be recruited , such as SHANK3 , Rich 2 and cortactin ( Geiger et al . , 1980 ; Durand et al . , 2007 ; Durand et al . , 2012 ; Li et al . , 2011 ; Cao et al . , 2012 ) . Figure 1 Figure 1 - Focal adhesions are multi - protein complexes that dynamically regulate cell attatchments . Proteins , most relevant to this study , are highlighted . Integrins form the connection to the extracellular matrix and are linked to the cytoskeleton through talin and vinculin . SHANK3 is a scaffold protein that binds actin , cortactin and the GAP protein Rich2 . DLC1 is a Rho - GAP protein recruited by talin . Rho - Kinase ( ROCK ) 3 1 . 3 - The Migrating cell Cellular chemotaxis is critical to the growth and maintenance of multicellular organisms . Cell migration requires a coordinated locomotion of intracellular protein networks within the actomyosin cytoskeleton . In lamellipodia , the initial adhesions formed by talin - integrin complexes create traction points that propagate actomyosin induced tensile force during migration ( figure 2 ) ( Horwitz and Webb , 2003 ; Plotnikov et al . , 2012 ) . This force promotes stabilisation of the adhesion complexes through the recruitment of proteins such as vinculin , indirectly linking integrin and actin ( Galbraith et al . , 2002 ) . In a similar way , scaffold proteins such as SHANK3 are recruited during neuronal growth cone formation and dendritic spine formation ( Gerrow et al . , 2006 ) . Aberrant expression of SHANK3 is responsible for a variety of neurological pathologies ; furthermore in dendritic spines SHANK3 colocalises with vinculin and phospho - paxillin at the end of actin tips ( Durand et al . , 2012 ) . Specific proteins contribute to the initiation of the adhesion complex . RIAM ( Rap1A Interacting Adaptor Molecule ) is recruited to the leading edge by Rap1A ( La Fuente et al . , 2004 ; Duchniewicz et al . , 2006 ) . In turn , talin is recruited by RIAM , inducing integrin activation ( Burridge et al . , 1983 ; La Fuente et al . , 2004 ; Calderwood et al . , 2002 ) ( figure 3 ) . At this early stage integrin inhibitory proteins may also be involved ; one such protein is the LUBAC ( Linear Ubiquitin Chain Assembly Complex ) component SHARPIN ( Shank binding RH domain containing protein ) . SHARPIN may be recruited to the early adhesion by , as yet , an unknown mechanism . This would facilitate a competing pathway to RIAM induced integrin activation ( Del Rio et al . , 2010 ; Rantala et al . , 2011 ) , where talin would be out - competed for integrin , and no activation would take place . Retrograde F - actin ( Fibrous actin ) flow is captured by talin , inducing talin stretch and vinculin recruitment ( De Pasquale & Izzard 1991 ) . Vinculin binds both actin and talin , thus coupling talin - integrin complexes to actomyosin ( Bloch & Geiger 1980 ; Sefton et al . , 1981 ) . As the cell continues to migrate , the nascent adhesions mature in a transition zone between lamellipodia and lamellum . Once mature , the adhesions at the lamellum remain stationary relative to the rest of the cell . Integrins at the trailing edge of the cell are endocytosed and transported to the leading edge ( Caswell et al . , 2009 ) . 4 Figure 2 B A Figure 2 - Stages of cell migration . A ) Fibroblast cell migration involves a protrusion of lamellipodia and subsequent nascent adhesion formation ( 1 and 2 ) . The nascent adhesion engagement with ECM provides a focal point of force that leads to enhanced stability ( 3 ) . The cell continues to migrate , utilising cortical myosin contraction to propell the nucleus ( 4 ) . Endocytosis at the trailing edge recycles integrin ( 5 ) ( Abercombie et al . , 1970 , Pegrum et al . , 1970 ) . B ) During neuronal growth cone formation , actin networks are responsible for the membrane protrusion in a manner analogous to the migratory fibroblast . 5 Figure 3 Figure 3 - Adhesion formation at the leading edge . 1 ) Talin is recruited to the cell membrane and activates integins . 2 ) Actin linkages are secured via talin and vinculin . 3 ) SHANK3 and SHARPIN may be recruited to the α - integrin tails and compete with talin for the integrin binding . DLC1 is recruited to the mature focal adhesions and negatively regulates actomyosin contraction ( Li et al . , 2011 ) . 6 1 . 4 - Nascent adhesion formation The formation of the nascent adhesions is dependent on the activation of integrin . Integrins are activated by the multi - domain protein talin ( Calderwood et al . , 2003 ) . Talin is recruited to the inactive integrin by the adaptor protein RIAM in a Rap1A - GTP dependent manner ( La Fuente et al . , 2004 ; Jenzora et al . , 2005 ; Han et al . , 2006 ; Watanabe et al . , 2008 ; Lee et al . , 2009 ; Goult et al . , 2013 ; Lee et al . , 2013 ) . Figure 4 shows the sequence of events resulting in integrin activation ; Wynne et al ( 2012 ) demonstrated that mCherry tagged Rap1A is localised to the cell membrane , while RIAM ( GFP ) has both membrane and cytosolic distribution . Han et al ( 2006 ) elegantly reconstructed the integrin activation cascade , demonstrating that talin , Rap1A and RIAM form an “integrin activation complex” , and that talin recruitment requires the N - terminus of RIAM ( a short amphipathic helix 6 - 30 ) ( Lee et al . , 2009 ) . Current data have established the importance of RIAM - talin interactions , structural basis of which is address in this study . 7 Figure 4 - The early events of the integrin activation are governed by an integrin initiation complex ( talin , integrin and RIAM ) . RIAM recruits talin to the cell membrane through direct interactions with Rap1A and talin ( Lee et al . , 2009 ) . Talin binds to the β - integrin tail , inducing a conformational change and activating the integrin heterodimer . As the cell continues to migrate talin binds actin ( Gingras et al . , 2010 ) and vinculin . This leads to the adhesion maturation and stress fibre linkages . Figure 4 8 1 . 5 - The Integrin clutch mediates adhesion stabilisation F - actin nucleation at the leading edge under the regulation of Arp2 / 3 complex creates a retrograde flow ( Mullins et al . , 2000 ; Winter et al . , 1997 ) ( figure 5 ) . Talin - vinculin complexes at the nascent adhesion capture retrograde flow , concentrating actin at the nascent adhesion ( Ponti et al . , 2004 ; Thievessen et al . , 2013 ) . Retrograde flow is a continuous process from the leading edge ; and talin - vinculin interactions provide a mechanism of slippage variation ( Mitchison and Kirschner et al . , 1988 ; Wang 2007 ; Gingras et al . , 2010 ) . The capture and arrest of the retrograde flow by talin generates a counterforce clutch ; this clutch uses the initial force from nucleation to drive the membrane forward , inducing lamellipodial protrusion . Additionally , actin binding induces talin stretch and formation of talin - vinculin complex , as well as a recruitment of other adhesion proteins . As the cell continues to migrate the nascent adhesions increase in size and change composition . The adhesion is always stationary , so as the cell migrates the adhesion enters a transition zone between lamellipodium and lamellum ( Abercombie et al . , 1970 ; Franz et al . , 2005 ; Thievessen et al . , 2013 ) . Inside this zone some adhesions stabilise into rich multi - protein complexes , and at this stage actin linkages have developed into cell stress fibre linkages . These linkages provide connections to the actomyosin contractile machinery and contribute to adhesion maturation ( figure 5 ) . 9 1 . 5 . 1 - Focal adhesion disassembly Focal adhesion disassembly is the final stage of adhesion turnover . At the trailing edge , integrins are required to be internalised via clathrin dependent endocytosis ( and then migrate back to the leading edge via lateral diffusion ( Bretscher 1992 ) ) . Image correlation spectroscopy methods show that integrin is clustered at the leading edge , and that lateral diffusion ( upon disassembly ) of integrin is relatively random ( Wiseman et al . , 2004 ) . For many years the working hypothesis of integrin cycling assumed the re - excocytosis of vesicles that were internalised from the trailing edge of adhesion . Recent evidence however suggests that the recycling of integrins may be far more specific to the leading edge , and regulated by the Rab family of GTPases . Caswell et al ( 2007 ) showed the GTPase Rab25 directly associates with α5β1 integrin and creates a localised pool of integrin at the leading edge . Adhesion disassembly would require the displacement of talin from integrin tails . The exact mechanism of this process however remains unknown . Cytoskeletal microtubule ( Nagano et al . , 2012 ) networks are believed to deliver and recruit proteins that mediate the disassembly process . Disassembly requires the eventual displacement of talin from the integrin tail , and multiple proteins are implicated in this process . The first is SHARPIN ( Rantala et al . , 2011 ) . SHARPIN binds α - integrin tails and inhibits the binding of talin to β - integrin in vivo . SHARPIN recruitment to the cell membrane could be involved in a mechanism where talin is displaced in favour of a SHARPIN - integrin complex . Talin is further targeted for degradation by calpain cleavage of the talin head , and ubiquitination through proteins such as Smurf1 ( Franco et al . , 2004 ; Huang et al . , 2009 , Critchley 2009 ) . 10 1 . 5 . 2 - Focal adhesions link to cell stress fibres Linkages between the adhesion complexes and actomyosin stress fibres are established within the transition zone . Cell - stress fibres are composed of 10 – 30 actin filaments bundled in a bi - polar arrangement ( Tojkander et al . , 2012 ) ; these bundles are stablised by the cross - linking protein α - actinin and non - muscular myosin II ( NMII ) . Myosin rich cell - stress fibres are regularly anchored to mature focal adhesions ; and provide force for stabilisation ( Tojkander et al . , 2012 ; Naumanen et al . , 2008 ; Cramer et al . , 1997 ; Pellegrin and Mellor 2007 ; Choi et al . , 2008 ) . NMII contraction ( figure 5B ) reveals binding sites in talin and induces formation of the talin - vinculin complex ( Del Rio et al . , 2010 ) . The neural growth cone is a migrating , actin - regulated outgrowth of a neuron in response to extracellular chemokines , thus actomyosin networks also play a part in the migratory process . Retrograde F - actin flow is witnessed both in neural growth cones and during growth cone formation , and functions in directed chemotaxis . The myosins ( non - muscular myosin II ) organise actin at the growth cone transition zone , and provide a boundary between the lamellipodium and the developing axon ( Medeiros et al . , 2006 ) . Inhibition of myosin II ( using the specific inhibitor blebbistatin ) decreases retrograde flow by 51 % ( Medeiros et al . , 2006 ) . The protrusive polymerising actin - end filaments at the leading edge accounting for the remaining actin flow . Under inhibition ( blebbistatin ) , filopodial actin bundles elongate , with substantially increased actin polymerisation at the leading edge . This is due to decreased rates of actin - bundle severing near their pointed ends that are located in the transition zone of the growth cone ( Medeiros et al . , 2006 ) . 11 Figure 5 Figure 5 - Links between actin networks and adhesion . A ) Arp2 / 3 mediated F - actin nucleation is caught by talin . This generates counterforce that induces lamellipodial protrusion . B ) Transition zone maturation is mediated by the adaptor protein connections to the actomyosin . Cell stress fibres are bundled by connections to α - actinin . Non - muscular myosin ( NMII ) drives actin contraction in an ATP dependent manner . 12 1 . 5 . 3 - Rho - GTPase and myosin regulation Non - muscular myosin II is regulated by the members of the Rho - GTPase family . Active Rho - GTPases ( RhoA and RhoC - GTP ) have diverse cellular functions , and are the primary regulators of ROCK ( Rho associated Protein Kinases ) mediated actomyosin contractility ( Totsukawa et al . , 2004 ; Tcherkezian and Vane 2007 ; Van Aelst and D’Souza - Schorey 1997 ) . The RhoA and RhoC family members act to promote actomyosin force generation through ROCK ( ROCK1 & 2 ) , and actin - end polymerisation through formin . ROCK phosphorylates myosin light chains and the LIM kinases ( figure 6 ) ( Rath and Olsen 2012 ; Gardel et al . , 2010 ) , simultaneously promoting actin filament stability through inactivation of the cofilin family proteins ( Totsukawa et al . , 2004 ) . This process leads to increased actin filament bundling and myosin - driven contraction ; contractility contributes directly to tension dependent adhesion maturation ( Itoh et al . , 1999 ; Riento et al . , 2003 ; Ridely 2003 ) . Inhibition of the Rho - signalling cascade results in decreased adhesion maturation and shorter adhesion life times ( Totsukawa et al . , 2004 ) . Figure 6 Figure 6 Rho - GTPases regulates cell stress fibre formation through the regulation of ROCK and formin . ROCK kinase phosphorylates myosin light chains , leading to stress fibre formation and contraction . 13 1 . 5 . 4 - Focal adhesion kinase and paxillin The activity Rho - GTPases and actin dynamics are indirectly regulated by the recruitment of tyrosine kinases to the focal adhesion ( Parsons et al . , 2010 ) . One such tyrosine kinase is focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) ; FAK is a FERM ( 4 . 1 protein , Ezrin , radixin and moesin ) domain containing protein , recruited to focal adhesions through interactions with talin or the β - integrin tail ( Parsons et al . , 2003 ; Lawson et al . , 2012 ) . FAK and paxillin form a complex at the focal adhesion ( Choi et al . , 2011 ) ; and phosphorylation of paxillin by FAK on Y31 and Y118 regulates and enhances lamellipodial protrusions ( Zaidel - Bar et al . , 2007 ) . Overexpression of phosphomimetic FAK ( tyrosine to glutamate substitution ) increases lamellipodial protrusion and nascent adhesion formation . Phenylalanine ( Y31F , Y118F ) mutations result in fibrillar large focal adhesions , consistent with a phenotype of contractile cells ( Zaidel - Bar et al . , 2007 ) . FAK binds to paxillin via a conserved hydrophobic LD motif LDxLLxxL ( Hoellerer et al . , 2003 ) . In vivo data are in agreement with the recruitment of paxillin being responsible for the activation of Rac - GTPase that controls actin polymerisation ( Parsons et al . , 2010 ) . Interestingly , recent evidence challenges the conventional model of integrin activation . In MEF ( Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts ) cells cultured on a fibronectin matrix , talin , FAK and paxillin colocalised in mature focal adhesions after 15 minutes . In FAK - null cells , talin was not localised in the early paxillin rich focal adhesions . In addition talin colocalised with FAK in cells expressing integrin Y783A mutant that abolishes talin interactions . This suggests that talin can be recruited to adhesions through FAK , independently of integrin ( Calderwood et al . , 2013 ; Lawson et al . , 2012 ) . 14 1 . 5 . 5 - The DLC1 Rho - GAP domain The Rho - GTPases are regulators actin dynamics and cell proliferation ( Tcherkezian and Vane 2007 ; Van Aelst and D’Souza - Schorey 1997 ) . The crucial role of GAPs ( GTPase Activating Proteins ) lies in their ability to negatively regulate the GTPases and promote hydrolysis from GTP to GDP ( Hall et al . , 2002 ) . This hydrolysis induces a conformational change , leading to the inactivation of the GTPase . The focal adhesion protein DLC1 is held in an autoinhibitory complex between the N - terminal SAM ( Sterile Alpha Motif ) and a C - terminal GAP domain ( Cao et al . , 2012 ) . Once activated by the adhesion protein tensin ( Cao et al . , 2012 ) the GAP domain of DLC1 negatively regulates actomyosin contraction through the change of myosin light chain phosphorylation ( figures 6 and 7 ) . Figure 7 Figure 7 - The GAP domain of DLC1 is held in the autoinhibitory complex with the SAM domain . Autoinhibition is relieved by the DLC1 binding simultaneously to the tensin ABD ( Actin Binding Domain ) and SH2 ( Serine Homology ) and PTB ( Phosphotyrosine Binding ) domains . Once active , the GAP domain promotes GTP hydrolysis and inactivation of Rho ( Li et al . , 2004 ) . 15 1 . 5 . 6 - Conformational changes in adhesion proteins Over the past decade there have been multiple studies characterising proteomic transitions within the focal adhesion complex ( Schiller and Fassler 2013 ) . Rho - GTPase regulation of the contractile machinery and nucleation from the leading edge provide the tension required for talin - vinculin mediated adhesion stabilisation . Eventual linkages to cell stress fibres provide the force required for maturation . This force gradually alters the conformation of talin and vinculin within the nascent adhesion ( Del Rio et al . , 2010 ; Fillingham et al . , 2005 ; Thievessen et al . , 2013 ) . Talin is composed of an atypical FERM domain , and a rod domain composed of a linear array of helical bundles ( Winkler et al . , 1997 ) ( for more detail see chapter 3 ) . There are 12 of the rod domains ( R1 - R12 ) and the first 6 domains contain multiple vinculin - binding sites ( VBS ) , adopting a compact “spring like” arrangement . VBSs are peptide like motifs that decorate the inside face of the helical bundles ( held cryptic ) . The compact N - terminal arrangement of R1 - R6 and the cryptic nature of vinculin binding suggest that talin may act as a tensile spring that opens up and reveals VBSs upon stretch . This would amplify vinculin binding upon the actin - clutch engagement . Single molecule measurements utilising magnetic tweezers to stretch the R1R2 double - domain of talin increases vinculin binding ( Del Rio et al . , 2010 ; Gingras et al . , 2005 ) . Furthermore , talin is subjected to cycles of actomyosin contractility , and vinculin recruitment to focal adhesions is partially dependent on NMII ( Pasapera et al . , 2010 ; Margadant et al . , 2011 ) . Blebbistatin ( a known inhibitor Myosin II ATPase ) inhibition of NMII prevents adhesion complex maturation , whereas NMII over - expression in CHO ( Chinese hamster ovary ) cells has the opposite effect , with increased mature focal adhesions relative0to0nascent0adhesions ( Vicente - Manzanares et al . , 2008 ; Vicente - Manzanares et al . , 2009 ) . Various recent studies have quantified the levels of tensile force at focal adhesion . Grashoff et al . , ( 2010 ) demonstrated using a FRET ( Forster Resonance Energy Transfer ) calibrated force sensor , that vinculin is both elongated and under tension at the mature focal adhesion ( Grasshoff et al . , 2010 ) . Du Roure et al . , ( 2005 ) measured this force by culturing a monolayer of MDCK ( Madin - Darby canine kidney cells ) on elastomeric pillars ; force measurements at the migratory edges of the cell were in a range between 5 nN and 20 nN ( Du Roure et al . , 2005 ) , the deflection of elastomeric pillars beneath cultured cells allowing the force to be calculated . 16 1 . 6 - Structural aspects of integrin activation The initial events of nascent adhesion formation have recently been characterised in vivo and in vitro ( discussed section 3 . 1 . 4 ) ( Lee et al . , 2009 ; Han et al . , 2006 ; Watanabe et al . , 2008 ) . This section will discuss the events of integrin activation beginning with the activation of talin and its recruitment to integrin . The key events in this process are shown in figure 8 . Figure 8 Figure 8 – Integrins are held in their autoinhibitory - closed state by interactions of the α and β sub - units . GTPase Rap1A recruits RIAM - talin complex to the cell membrane . This brings the talin head domain ( green oval ) in proximity to the β - integrin tail . PIP2 ( Phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ) at the cell membrane activates talin , and the talin head binds to the β - integrin tail . This induces the conformational change that activates integrin . As the focal adhesion matures , proteins such as vinculin and DLC1 may be recruited , securing actin networks that bind proteins such as SHANK3 . SHANK3 and DLC1 promote direct and indirect interactions that help regulation of the Rho - GTPases . 17 1 . 6 . 1 – The Rap1A effector RIAM mediates talin recruitment Recent evidence has placed the small GTPase Rap1A ( Nagata et al . , 1989 ) central to the regulation of integrin activation . Fibroblasts deficient of the Rap1A GEF ( Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factor ) C3G show impaired adhesion and accelerated cell migration . This phenotype can be reversed by over - expression of the Rap1A GEF EPAC ( Ohba et al . , 2001 ) . Cells transfected with the Rap1 AE63 activation mutant show similar levels of integrin activation as cells overexpressing RIAM when cultured on a fibronectin matrix ( La Fuente et al . , 2004 ) . Activation is inhibited by treatment of cells with the VLA β1 inhibitory antibody , suggesting that RIAM and Rap1A share a common interaction pathway ( La Fuente et al . , 2004 ) . RIAM knockdown in primary leukocytes using shRNA depletes Rap1A dependant cell adhesion ( La Fuente et al . , 2004 ) . Han et al ( 2006 ) and Lee et al ( 2009 ) demonstrated that RIAM creates a link between talin and Rap1A and is required for the focal adhesion formation ( more detail will be given in chapter 3 ) . Wynne et al ( 2012 ) suggests a mechanism whereby the PH domain of RIAM is recruited by Rap1A - GTP and lipid microdomains of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( PIP2 ) . This establishes membrane anchorage of RIAM that subsequently recruits talin to the membrane . 18 1 . 6 . 2 - Integrin activation Integrin activation includes increased integrin extracellular ligand affinity , and increased clustering ; both of which are dependent on the intracellular integrin - talin interaction ( Shattil et al . , 2010 ) . Integrins are heterodimeric type one transmembrane proteins consisting of one α and one β subunit ( Hynes 1987 ) . In mammalian biology there are currently 18 α - subunits , and 9 β - subunits ( Humphries et al . , 2006 ) . Integrin heterodimers are held in the inactive closed state stabilised by the packing of α - β transmembrane helices . Point mutations and structural analysis of the integrins reveal that the salt bridge between D723 of the αII and R995 of the β3 integrin tails stabilises the α - β complex ( Lau et al . , 2009 ) . Talin head binding to the β - integrin cytoplasmic tail is the final event of integrin activation , demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo ( Han et al . , 2006 ; Lee et al . , 2009 ) . Integrins are engaged and activated by the talin N - terminal atypical FERM domain . Usually FERM domains contain three sub - domains F1 - F3 ; the talin N - terminal FERM domain is atypical as it contains four sub - domains F0 , F1 , F2 and F3 ( Elliott et al . , 2010 ) . F0 and F1 domains have ubiquitin - like fold , F2 and F3 is a phosphotyrosine - binding domain ( PTB ) . When talin F3 binds to the membrane proximal region of the β3 - integrin tail , a conformational change is induced . This conformational change sees the closed in - active ecto - domain proverbially open up , thus increasing integrin affinity for extracellular ligands . This is considered to be the active state , and the process referred to as inside - out activation ( Bledzka et al . , 2012 ; Calderwood et al . , 2002 ; Tadokoro et al . , 2003 ; Lau et al . , 2009 ; Xiong et al . , 2001 ) . Conversely , integrins can also participate in the outside - in signalling , and the activation can be induced by divalent cations ( Ca 2 + , Mg 2 + , Mn 2 + ) or fibronectin . Divalent cations and fibronectin bind the integrin ecto - domain and induce the same conformational change as induced by the inside - out signalling ( Hynes et al . , 2002 ; Adair et al . , 2005 ; Nishida et al . , 2006 ; Tiwari et al . , 2011 ) . 19 1 . 6 . 2 . 1 - Kindlin and focal adhesion assembly The kindlin family proteins ( kindlins 1 - 3 ) directly bind the membrane distal region of β - integrin cytoplasmic tails , and inhibitory kindlin - integrin mutations reduce talin dependent integrin activation ( Calderwood et al . , 2013 ) . This implies that the kindlin – integrin interaction is required for the optimal integrin activation ( Calderwood et al . , 2013 ) . Like talin , kindlins contain a FERM domain ; kindlin FERM domains differ to talin by the presence of a PH ( Pleckstrin Homology ) sub - domain , adjacent to the F2 sub - domain ( Hyvonen et al . , 1995 ) ( Figure 9 ) . The kindlin F3 sub - domain binds to the membrane distal NITY sequence of β - integrin ( Bledzka et al . , 2012 ) , whereas the talin F3 sub - domain has higher affinity for the membrane proximal NPLY sequence ( Calderwood et al . , 2013 ) . Current models suggest that kindlin and talin may form a ternary complex with β - integrin ( Calderwood et al . , 2013 ) . Ye et al . , ( 2013 ) in fact demonstrated that kindlins do not affect the affinity of αIIbβ3 for extracellular ligands , nor is activation by talin synergistically increased . Membrane distal integrin - kindlin interactions increase clustering of the activated integrin heterodimers , thus strengthening the focal contact . 20 Figure 9 Figure 9 - Schematic representation of the integrin heterodimer . The integrin ectodomain region forms a compact inactive complex regulated by interactions of the transmembrane helices . Upon engagement of the cytosolic β - integrin NPxY motif by talin , a conformational change is induced . The resulting conformation is the open integrin active state . β3 integrin contains two sites that contain the NPxY motifs ( highlighted in red ) . These are located in region 760 - 790 of the human β3 integrin sequence . The crystal structure of talin F2F3 in complex with the β3 integrin tail containing the membrane proximal NPLY sequence is shown ( 3G9W ) . 21 1 . 6 . 3 - Talin activation Talin has been shown by cryo - EM to be a globular doughnut shaped dimer ( Goult et al . , 2013 ) . In addition , gel filtration and other electron microscopy ( EM ) studies have shown that talin can have an extended conformation ( Kanchanawong et al . , 2010 ; Molony et al . , 1987 ) . This led to a model that a globular cytosolic talin is recruited to the cell membrane where it becomes elongated under tension ( Kanchanawong et al . , 2010 ; Isenberg 1998 ) . Goult et al ( 2009 ) and Goksoy et al ( 2008 ) show that talin is held in an autoinhibitory complex between the F3 sub - domain and the rod domain R9 . The F3 - R9 complex sterically restricts F3 - integrin binding , thus inhibiting integrin activation ( Goult et al . , 2009 ) . This complex can be abolished by mutagenesis , and doing so results in increased focal adhesion assembly ( Kopp et al . , 2010 ) . The second messenger PIP2 ( PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) activates talin ( Martel et al . , 2001 ) ; PIP2 binds to the talin head F2 sub - domain , and disrupts the F3 - R9 autoinhibitory complex ( Martel et al . , 2001 ; Goksoy et al . , 2008 ) . This event could occur at the cell membrane surrounding the integrin tail ( figure 10 ) by localised PIP2 synthesis . Tolias et al ( 1997 ) showed a direct interaction between α3β1 integrin and PI 4 - kinase , an intracellular enzyme that controls PIP2 synthesis , demonstrating PIP2 regulatory proteins are recruited to integrin . PIP2 production is catalysed by PtdIns kinase Iγ , and cells lacking PtdInsP kinase Iγ ( the talin binding isoform ) have reduced nascent adhesion formation and reduced talin - vinculin recruitment ( Legate et al . , 2011 ) . PIP2 interactions with talin are localised to the F2 sub - domain and the charge reversal mutation ( K274E ) is inhibitory . Introduction of this mutation induces a similar phenotype as the ablation of PtdinsP kinase Iγ ; demonstrating diminished nascent adhesion formation and reduced talin - vinculin recruitment ( Legate et al . , 2011 ) . A secondary effect of the localised increase of PIP2 concentration is the induced formation of helical structure in the large insert of the talin F1 sub - domain ( Goult et al . , 2010 ) . In isolation the F1 loop is predominantly unstructured with only a small population in a helical state . Upon the binding to the PIP2 enriched membranes , the loop adopts an α - helical conformation , with positive charges concentrated on one side of the helix , shortening the F1 loop and drawing the talin head to the cell membrane . This interaction re - orientates the FERM domain in complex with integrin ; the torsional force generated by re - orientation disrupts the inner membrane salt bridge of the αIIβ3 integrin and β3 integrin inducing activation ( Lau et al . , 2009 ; Wegener et al . , 2007 ; Elliott et al . , 2010 ) . 22 Figure 10 - Cartoon representation of inactive talin . Talin is held in an inactive conformation between the N - terminal atypical FERM ( consisting of four subdomains F0 - F3 ) domain and the R9 talin rod domain . PIP2 activates talin ( Martel et al . , 2001 ) , and talin is localised to the cell membrane in proximity to integrins . RIAM recruits talin to the leading edge , bringing the FERM domain in proximity to both the β - integrin tail and membrane localised pools of PIP2 . This activates talin , revealing the F3 sub - domain to engage the integrin tail . Figure 10 23 1 . 7 – The Post - synaptic density The postsynaptic density ( PSD ) is a signallosome mediating the transmission of neuronal signals from the presynaptic density . The PSD can be around 200nm - 800nm in diameter with a depth of 50nm ( Cohen et al . , 1977 ; Blomberg0 et al . , 1977 ; Carlin0 et0al . , 01980 ) . This large signallosome , like the focal adhesion , links extracellular processes with the actin cytoskeleton . Figure 11 shows the ultrastructure of the postsynaptic density ; the density is composed of membrane receptors and scaffold proteins . The postsynaptic membrane contains NMDARs ( N - methyl - d - aspartate receptors ) and AMPARs ( α - amino - 3 - hydroxy - 5 - methyl - 4 - isoxazole propionic acid receptors ) . Scaffold proteins such as PSD95 and the SHANK proteins are part of a protein network beneath the cell membrane receptors ( Boeckers et al . , 1999 ; Lim et al . , 1999 ; Naisbitt et al . , 1999 ; Gerrow et al . , 2006 ) ; these proteins are amongst the first localised to the postsynaptic density with actin ( Gerrow et al . , 2006 ) , providing the PSD cell surface receptors an indirect link to the cytoskeleton through the passive scaffold SHANK3 . SHANK3 also helps to regulate dendritic spine formation ; overexpression of SHANK3 induces spine head hypertrophy ( Sala et al . , 2001 ) and spine formation in spiny cerebellar neurons ( Roussignol et al . , 2005 ) . 1 . 7 . 1 – SHANK family proteins SHANKs ( 1 - 3 ) are multidomain proteins consisting of an N - terminal unstructured region , ankyrin repeat domain , SH3 domain , PDZ domain and a proline rich linker followed by a C - terminal SAM domain . In vivo there are a plethora of tissue specific isoforms ; and diversity arises due to multiple intragenic promoters ( Wang et al . , 2011 ) . Mameza et al ( 2013 ) demonstrated that mutations within N - terminal 100 residues of SHANK3 have an effect upon SHARPIN binding , suggesting a regulatory mechanism . Pathogenic mutation within the region , L68P , increases the levels of SHARPIN binding detected by in vitro pull down . This region was dubbed as the SPN ( SHANK Pro / Sap N - terminal ) region and has been identified previously to be functionally significant by Durand et al ( 2012 ) . Durand et al ( 2012 ) demonstrated that the distribution of SHANK3 is dispersed between the cell membrane , and large cytosolic pools in COS - 7 ( a fibroblast like cell line ) cells . Membrane recruitment of SHANK3 is diminished by the mutations R12C and R300C , these residues are also contained within the SPN region and ankyrin repeats respectively ( Mameza et al . , 2013 ) . Structural information on the N - terminal region of SHANK is critical for the understanding of SHANK interactions with ligands , and the effects 24 of mutations . 1 . 8 – Conclusions and perspectives Linkages to the actin cytoskeleton provide the cell with the means to induce morphological changes in response to extracellular cues . In neuronal complexes and adhesions cytoskeleton remodelling is regulated through Rap1A . Rap1A provides the ability to recruit talin and subsequently concentrate actin linkages at the leading edge through talin - vinculin interactions . In this case , actin binding by the talin - vinculin complex provides the cell with an immediate clutch to induce protrusive lamellipodia , in a self - perpetuating method of tension dependent self - stabilisation . It is clear that SHANK3 , like talin , provides a link to actin through downstream signals of the PSD . SHANK proteins do not directly signal intracellularly , instead they recruit proteins to fulfil this function . In this respect they act as a scaffold in a multi - tiered PSD0linking0NMDA0receptors0to0actin . A common feature of both SHANK3 and talin is their mutual recruitment of GAP proteins to negatively attenuate stress fibre formation . The central actin - binding region of talin binds DLC1 , and SHANK3 binds the Rho - GAP protein Rich 2 ( Raynaud et al . , 2013 ) . Thus both scaffolds have the potential to both directly0or0indirectly , recruit0and0regulate0actin . 00000000000000000000000000000000 This thesis will elucidate the molecular interactions that govern the leading edge recruitment of talin and the stabilisation of the nascent adhesion . Furthermore this thesis will study the details of molecular interaction of talin - DLC1 , suggesting inhibitory talin mutations that may disrupt the binding . SHANK3 binds the integrin regulator SHARPIN , and the unstructured SPN region inhibits binding . The structural and biophysical characterisation of SHANK is required for the understanding its function . 25 Figure 11 Figure 11 - SHANK proteins act as scaffolds at the postsynaptic density , facilitating the linkage to actin . PSD proteins shown are NMDA ( N - methyl - D - aspartate receptor ) , AMPA ( α - amino - 3 - hydroxy - 5 - methyl - 4 - isoxazolepropionic acid receptor ) , PSD - 95 ( Post synaptic density protein ) , CamKII ( Calmodulin kinase II ) , Homer and the mGlu ( metatropic glutamate receptor ) .

As of yet the extent and affinity of RIAM interactions are unknown , as are the mechanisms of RIAM displacement as adhesions stabilise . Thus the aims of chapter 3 are to - - Characterise the binding sites and stoichiometry between RIAM and talin . - Characterise the affinities of intermolecular complexes . - Analyse competition between vinculin , RIAM and talin . - Structurally characterise RIAM - talin complexes . At the mature focal adhesion Rho - GAP proteins are recruited to negatively regulate the contractile actomyosin machinery . DLC1 is recruited to focal adhesions , and interacts with the central actin - binding region of the talin rod . The aims of this chapter 4 are to - - Determine the specificity of talin - DLC1 interactions . - Determine the structure of DLC1 complexes . - Design mutants to abolish the interaction in vivo .

Primer extensions ( table 1 ) were added in the 3’ direction to facilitate integration in the same open reading frame as the fusion tag . Primers were designed to enable synchronous primer annealing to the template DNA with minimal CG content to prevent secondary structure DNA formation . The primers were required to have melting temperatures within 5 o C of each other . Additionally , primers were required to be non - complementary to prevent “primer dimer” formation . Primers for mutagenesis are discussed later .

Hot start polymerases are bound by an antibody and inactive , the initiation of the PCR reaction required pre - incubation for 98 o C for 2 minutes , then 95 o C for 30 seconds , 47 o C annealing temperature for 30 seconds ( this varied usually 3 o C below the lowest melting temperature of the annealing primer ) , and a final 72 o C extension cycle . The cycle was then repeated 29 times exponentially multiplying the desired DNA fragment .

Initially 2 PCR fragments were generated with a mutation introduced in two complementary overhangs . Complementary primers are shown in diagram 1 as Mut - Fwd and Mut - Rev . These two primers overlap in their respective 3’ directions with a 12 - 15bp overhang . The mutation was usually central in this design allowing 6 bp either side of the codon mutation to ensure successful hybridisation . If the initial PCR was successful , the two fragments were extracted via gel extraction and purified using electrophoresis ( to remove primers , enzyme and template DNA ) . The two fragments were annealed using wild type forward and reverse primers in a PCR reaction under identical conditions as their original PCR . This fragment was then verified by electrophoresis and subsequently used for infusion . Primer designs for mutation are shown in diagram 1 . After successful integration plasmids were sequenced to verify the introduction of the mutation .

This was treated with Chloramphenicol ( to inhibit protein synthesis ) and subsequently maxi - prepped ( Qiagen ) . DNA was digested with KpnI and HindIII ( NEB ) ; and was purified using gel extraction and concentrated . A control blue white screen tested efficacy of digested vector . 2 . 2 . 5 - Ligation independent cloning The method of plasmid generation used in this thesis was the ligation independent cloning system developed by Clontech TM . pOPINS is derived from pET28a ( Invitrogen ) , generating N - terminal His - tagged Sumo fusion protein ( Sun et al . , 2008 ) . Sumo enhances solubility ( Mossessova et al . , 2000 ) substantially increases protein yield ( Sun et al . , 2008 ) . pOPINF is derived from the pTri - ex2 ( Novagen ) series of vectors and contains T7 , CMV ( cyto magelovirus ) and P10 promoter for baculovirus expression . pOPINF encodes an N - terminal His - tag followed by a 3C protease cleavage site , and is part of a series of vectors that all share the same infusion site pOPINM is an MBP ( MalE Maltose binding protein ) , pOPINJ is an N - terminal His - tagged GST ( Glutathione - S - transferase ) fusion ( Berrow et al . , 2007 ) . 35 | P a g e Figure 2 Figure 2 A ) Overview of the ligation independent cloning procedure using the Infusion advance HD kit ( Clontech ) in combination with OPPF vectors . B ) Fusion proteins designs used in this thesis pET151D encodes a TEV cleavage site . pOPINS and pETSUMO both encode an N - terminal Hexa - histidine tagged Sumo fusions , and pOPINM an N - terminal hexahistidine Maltose binding protein fusion cleavable by 3C protease . A B 36 | P a g e 2 . 2 . 6 - Transformation Plasmid DNA ( 2µl ) ( purified by mini - prep QIAGEN ) ( at 100ng / µL ) was added to a vial of chemically competent cells ( BL21 * ( DE3 ) ( Invitrogen ) ( for pOPINS / pET151 / 15b ) and Rosetta 2 pLacI ( Invitrogen ) ( pOPINF / J / M ) ) . pOPINF / J / M cannot be transformed into BL21 * ( DE3 ) due to the lack of the pLacI element in the plasmid . This is compensated for by the presence of the chloramphenicol resistant plasmid within the pLacI strain . This plasmid also provides rare tRNAs making this strain ideal for eukaryotic proteins . Additionally 1 % glucose was added to transformation plates to assist in suppression of toxic protein expression . For blue white screening XL1Blue ( Novagen ) or Stellar competent cells ( Clontech ) were used . Cells were incubated on ice for 30 minutes and heat shocked at 42 o C for 30 seconds and then cooled on ice for 30 seconds . Cells were then incubated with SOC media for 1 hour , spun down at 3000rpm for 30 seconds and plated onto agar containing the desired antibiotic resistance selection pressure . 2 . 2 . 7 - Plasmids Talin and vinculin Vd1 were kindly provided by the Prof . D . Critchley’s lab at the University in Leiceste . All talin fragments mentioned in this thesis are in pET151 / D . The vinculin Vd1 domain was provided in pET15b . SHANK3 was kindly provided in pETSUMO by Dr Hans Kreinkamp ( University Hospital Eppendorf Hamburg ) . 37 | P a g e 2 . 3 - Protein expression and purification 2 . 3 . 1 - SDS - PAGE electrophoresis SDS - Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis ( SDS - PAGE ) was performed using gels cast using the Bio - Rad Mini - PROTEAN™ III system . Generally 10 - 15 % acrylamide gels were poured and consisted of a resolving and stacking gel . The resolving gel was formed of 750 mM Tris pH 8 . 5 , 0 . 1 % w / v SDS , 10 - 15 % v / v acrylamide , 0 . 1 % w / v ammonium persulphate , 0 . 0004 % v / v TEMED . Once poured a layer of water saturated isobutanol was added , and removed after polymerisation . The stacking gels were formed of 125 mM Tris pH 6 . 8 , 0 . 1 % w / v SDS , 4 % v / v acrylamide , 0 . 02 % w / v ammonium persulphate , 0 . 0002 % v / v TEMED . TEMED was always added at the end of the mixing process to begin polymerisation . Samples were prepared prior to electrophoresis by adding sample buffer ( 10x SDS - running buffer , 3 % w / v Tris base , 14 % w / v glycine or tricine , 1 % w / v SDS ) . Samples were boiled for 3 minutes prior to loading and gels were calibrated using NEB ( 10 - 250kDa ) pre - stained protein marker . Gels were stained using 0 . 4 % w / v Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 , 50 % v / v methanol and 10 % v / v acetic acid . Gels were subsequently destained in 50 % v / v methanol and 10 % v / v acetic acid and 40 % v / v H 2 0 . 2 . 3 . 2 - Protein expression Plasmid DNA was transformed into E . Coli by heat shock . A single colony was then taken and grown overnight in a 10ml overnight culture at 37 o C . This culture as then grown in 1 litre of 2YT media to an optical density of 0 . 6 @ 600nm at 30 o C and induced using IPTG at 18 o C . For isotopically labelled proteins 1 colony was taken and grown for 8 hours in a 1ml LB culture to an optical density of 1 @ 600nm . 150μl of this was then used in a 10ml overnight culture containing 2M9 media . To note this small volume was used to avoid the dilution effect of isotopes . This 10ml culture was then grown in 1 litre of culture at 37 o C and induced overnight using 300 IPTG at 18 o C . 2 . 3 . 3 - Protein purification Cultured cells were harvested at 5000 rpm for 10 minutes . Cells were resuspended in the desired buffer ( 30ml per litre of culture ) of their respective purification protocol . For nickel affinity chromatography cells were homogenised at 1000 psi using French press containing cocktail VII protease inhibitors EDTA free ( Calbiochem ) and bovine deoxyribonuclease ( Sigma ) 20 mM Na 2 HPO 4 pH7 . 4 , 500 mM NaCl , 25 mM Imidazole ( Low imidazole buffer ) . Cells were then centrifuged at 18 , 000 rpm for 30 minutes and subsequently filtered using a 0 . 22µM filter for FPLC ( Fast protein liquid chromatography ) . Proteins were purified on an AKTA purifier FPLC ( Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography ) systems equipped with triple wavelength and peristaltic pump . 38 | P a g e 2 . 3 . 4 - Nickel affinity chromatography Cell lysate was loaded on to a 5ml His - trap HP ( GE healthcare ) using a peristaltic pump , and loaded at a flow rate of 4ml / min . Once bound , the protein was eluted over 10 column volumes using a linear gradient ( 10 column volumes ) of 20 mM Na 2 HPO 4 pH 7 . 4 , 500 mM NaCl , 500 mM Imidazole ( High imidazole buffer ) . Protein was then dialysed overnight into low imidazole buffer and the fusion tag was cleaved at the same time as TEV cleavage . Proteins expressed in pET151 / D all contained N - terminal His - tags followed by a V5 epitope and TEV protease cleavage site . TEV / Sumo / 3C proteases were produced recombinantly and removed by a reverse pass through the nickel column . Sumo protease cleavages differ slightly ; the protein and protease mixture was exchanged in 20 mM Na 2 HPO 4 pH 7 . 4 , 50 mM NaCl , and 2mM DTT . Sumo protease is highly processive ; theoretically a 3 - hour cleavage can be used at room temperature . However to maintain the integrity of the protein product proteins in this thesis were incubated at 4 o C overnight still achieving complete cleavage as judged by SDS - PAGE . Once Sumo has been cleaved the sample was exchanged into low imidazole buffer and further purified by reverse pass through the nickel column . 2 . 3 . 50 - Ion exchange chromatography For anion exchange ( QFF ) chromatography protein was exchanged into 20 mM Tris pH 8 - 8 . 5 ( 2 mM Dithiothreitol if cysteines are present ) . Protein was loaded on to a QFF fast flow ( GE Healthcare ) column at a flow rate of 4ml / min and eluted after a 3CV ( column volumes ) wash , over a linear gradient of 10CV using 20 mM Tris pH 8 - 8 . 5 1M NaCl . When using a cation ( SPFF ) column ( GE Healthcare ) protein was loaded in 20 mM PO 4 pH 6 - 6 . 5 ( 2 mM Dithiothreitol if cysteines are present ) . The column was washed for 3CV and then protein was eluted using a linear gradient ( 10CV ) with 20 mM PO 4 pH 6 - 6 . 5 , 1M NaCl . 2 . 3 . 6 - Size exclusion chromatography Gel filtration was always performed using 20 mM Tris pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl and 2 mM DTT . Depending on the molecular weight of the protein either a Superdex 75 26 / 60 or Superdex 200 26 / 30 was used at a flow rate of 2ml / min . A Superdex 75 / 26 60 column can resolve proteins ranging from 10 - 75kDa , a 200 column can resolve 10kDa and 600kDa ( GE healthcare ) . In analytical experiments buffer conditions were kept the same except using a Superdex 75 / 10 300GL or 200 / 10 300GL column was used at a flow rate of 0 . 75 ml / min . 39 | P a g e 2 . 3 . 7 - Protein concentration Protein concentration was determined by A280nm using a nano - drop 3000 , and calculated extinction coefficient of respective proteins determined by Prot - Param ( Gasteiger et al . , 2005 ) . For proteins where this method is ineffective a Bradford assay was used and calibrated using a control curve of Bovine Serum Albumin ( 0 . 2mg - 1mg / ml ) . To confirm Bradford estimates molar concentrations were compared with the 1 H spectrum of proteins of a similar molecular weight ( and tertiary fold ) . 2 . 3 . 8 - Proteases Recombinant TEV / Sumo / 3C proteases were produced from plasmids and glycerol stocks provided from Dr Paul Elliott in BL21 * ( DE3 ) . Cells were grown to OD 0 . 6 @ 600nm and induced using 500µM IPTG at 18 o C overnight . Cells were pelleted and re - suspended in low imidazole buffer containing 10 % glycerol . After nickel affinity chromatography protein was exchanged into 20 mM Tris pH 8 , 150 mM NaCl , 3 mM DTT , 5 mM EDTA , 20 % glycerol and flash frozen . Activity of each protease was tested with control sample and verified using SDS - PAGE . 40 | P a g e 2 . 4 - Multi - angle laser light scattering SEC - MALLS data in this thesis were collected at the SEC - MALLS facility at the University of Manchester . Data was collected using a Wyatt Dawn HELEOS - II 18 - angle light scattering detector and Wyatt Optilab rEX refractive index monitor linked to FPLC system ( Amersham ) . This detector was coupled to a FPLC system using a Superdex 75 / 10 300GL analytical column at a constant flow rate of 0 . 75ml / min . SEC - MALLS couples gel filtration with the measurement of molar mass , as shown in figure 3 . Figure 3 Figure 3 – Experimental set up of SEC - MALLS , analytical gel filtration of a sample is recorded via a MALLS detector . Laser light scattering provides information of the molar mass across peak ( Mw ) and intensity ( Refractive units ) . 41 | P a g e 2 . 4 . 1 - Isothermal titration calorimetry A standard isothermal calorimeter ( ITC - 2000 - Microcal ) is composed of two identical cells made of a highly efficient thermal conducting , and chemically inert material surrounded by an adiabatic jacket ( Leavitt and Freire 2001 ) . Sensitive inert materials detect the thermal differences between reference cells and sample cells , and compensat by reverting to the baseline ( figure 4 ) . Figure 4 ITC has been extensively used to study protein - protein interactions and it is considered to be the gold standard in the determination of binding constants ( Leavitt and Freire 2001 ) . It is the only technique that determines directly the thermodynamic parameters of an interaction ( ΔH and ΔS ) . Protein - protein interactions induce a change in the solution temperatures that is compensated for by the calorimeter in a feedback loop ( Leavitt and Freire 2001 ) . The stepwise injection of one titrant into the calorimetric cell containing the second protein allows measurement of the heat of the reaction for both exothermic and endothermic processes ( Figure 4 ) . ITC relies on the kinetic measurement of a dynamic equilibrium between two interacting proteins ( Leavitt and Freire 2001 ) . The strength of the interaction is reflected in the absolute value of dissociation constant which is calculated from Ka and given by Figure 4 – Diagram of the isothermal titration calorimeter with accompanying example of an isotherm . The ITC machine detects thermal difference between the sample and the reference cells ( Δ T ) . 42 | P a g e and The free energy of complex formation can then be calculated by Thus both binding constant and thermodynamic parameters and are calculated from the ITC data . 2 . 5 - Crystallisation accessories For the vinculin - RIAM complex , manually dispensed 96 well plates designed for sitting drop vapour diffusion were used ( MRC plates Molecular dimensions ) . Plates used on the 96 dispensive Inovadyne screen maker were 96 well intelliplates purchased from ARI . All plates were set up with 80µL of buffer within the vapour well . Plate seals were purchased from Starlabs as well as 96 deep well blocks and block seals . Sparse matrix screens employed were always Wizard I and Wizard II ( Emerald Biosystems ) , PEGRX I and PEGRX II ( Hampton research ) , JCSG + , AmSO 4 , PACT , Classics I , Classics II , Cryo and Classics Lite ( Qiagen ) . 2 . 5 . 1 - Crystallisation screening 2 . 5 . 1 . 1 - The crystal structure of RIAM - vinculin The vinculin Vd1 domain was exchanged into 20 mM Tris pH 7 . 4 , 50 mM NaCl and 2 mM DTT . Protein was concentrated to 9mg / ml ( 300µM ) . RIAM peptide was purchased from Genic Bio TM 1 MGESSEDIDQMFSTLLGEMDLLTQSLGVDTLY 32 and dissolved in 20 mM Tris pH 7 . 4 , 50 mM NaCl and 2 mM DTT . Crystal screens were set up with RIAM in 2 - 1 molar excess at 21 o C and 4 o C . Crystals were optimised as described in chapter 3 . 2 . 5 . 1 . 2 - The crystal structure of R7R8 and DLC1 R7R8 was exchanged into 20 mM Tris pH 7 . 4 , 50 mM NaCl and 2 mM DTT . Protein was concentrated to 10mg / ml ( 300µM ) . The peptide 467 PELDDILYHVKGMQRIVNQWSEK 489 was synthesised by Genic Bio TM and dissolved in 20 mM Tris pH 7 . 4 , 50 mM NaCl and 2 mM DTT . Initial crystal screens were set up with peptide in a 4 - 1 and 8 - 1 molar excess ( 1 . 2 mM ) at 21 o C and 4 o C . Crystals were optimised as described in chapter 4 . 43 | P a g e 2 . 5 . 1 . 2 . 3 - The Crystal structure of the SHANK3 N - terminus SHANK 1 - 348 was exchanged into 20 mM Tris pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl and 2 mM DTT . Screens were set up in a 96 well Intelliplate ( AIB ) designed for sitting drop vapour diffusion 21 o C and 4 o C . No optimisation was required . 2 . 5 . 2 - Data collection Data were collected at Diamond light source on I24 ( λ0 . 97Å ) , I04 ( λ0 . 97Å ) or I04 - 1 ( λ0 . 92Å ) . Collection was performed at 100k in a stream of boiled off nitrogen to reduce radiation damage . For cryo - crystallography crystals were mounted using either litholoops ( Molecular Dimensions ) or Mitegen micro - loops . For vinculin - RIAM and R8 - DLC1 , crystals were instantly cooled in liquid nitrogen and transferred to magnetic vials ( Hampton ) . Cooled vials were transferred to canes and at the synchrotron samples were transferred into pre - cooled pucks , which were then transferred to the data collection dewar . For the SHANK structures crystals were stored in pre - cooled pucks that could be instantly loaded on to synchrotron robotics without sample transfer thus reducing the chances of humidity effecting crystal quality . 2 . 6 - NMR experiments NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker avance 600Mhz and 800MHz spectrometers equipped with cryoprobes . Experiments were performed at 298K in 20 mM P0 4 pH 6 . 5 , 50 mM NaCl . Precompiled pulse sequences for HSQC ( Bodenhausen et al . , 1980 ) HNCACACB ( Grzesiekt et al . , 1992 ) , CBCACONH ( Grzesiek et al . , 1992 ) , HAHBNH and HBHACONH ( Clubb 1992 ) , HNCO and HNCACO ( Clubb 1992 ) were used and data was processed using Topspin 2 . 1 and CCPN analysis 2 . 2 ( Vranken et al . , 2005 ) . The process of assignment is described chapter 3 . For the calculation of Δδ shift values all resonances were arbitrarily assigned and tracked through titration points . Combined chemical shift was calculated as Δδ = √ ( Δδ H2 + ( Δδ N * 0 . 15 ) 2 ) ( Williamson et al . , 2013 ) . The top 20 shifts were used to produces the ranges quoted . 44 | P a g e 2 . 7 - Servers , databases and Programs used in this thesis 2 . 7 . 1 - Sequence analysis Uniprot - Used as the source for reference sequences .

These adhesions are transient with initiation and growth phases followed by disassembly . Once mature the adhesions link the ECM to the actin cytoskeleton . The linkage to the extracellular matrix is mediated through integrin heterodimers , these heterodimers switch between open ( active ) and closed ( inactive ) states that regulate activity . Integrins are activated by talin the 250kDa cytoskeletal scaffold protein . Cytoplasmic pools of talin need to be recruited to the integrin at the cell membrane to induce activation . At the early focal adhesion the GTPase Rap1A recruits the adaptor protein RIAM ( Rap1 Interacting Adaptor Molecule ) and RIAM recruits talin to integrins resulting in activation . As the focal adhesion matures actin linkages are strengthened by recruitment of the talin - actin bridging protein vinculin . In vivo data shows RIAM is not found at the mature focal adhesions and our data shows that both RIAM and vinculin occupy the same binding sites on talin ( Goult et al . , 2013 ; Lee et al . , 2013 ; Han et al . , 2006 ) . Thus the goals of this chapter were to first structurally characterise talin - RIAM interactions and then the switching to the talin - vinculin complexes . 3 . 1 . 1 - Talin Talin is a 250kDa cytoskeletal scaffold protein containing an N - terminal atypical FERM domain ( Elliott et al . , 2011 ) . The FERM domain is connected via a flexible linker containing an unstructured calpain cleavage site to a C - terminal rod domain . The rod domain is composed of 62 helices arranged into 4 and 5 - helix bundles . The 4 - helix bundles adopt a left handed up - down twist topology , and the 5 - helix bundles follow an up - down anti - parallel topology , with the helices typically 23 - 30 residues in length . The peptide sequence of talin is largely alanine and leucine rich with low content of aromatic residues . This has the result of facilitating the packing of the 62 α - helices into the compact helical bundles that define the rod structure . The six N - terminal domains of the rod are unusual given their predicted compact N and C - terminal connections and their high concentration of vinculin binding sites ( figure 1 ) . The highest concentration of vinculin binding sites are localised in the R2R3 double domain and in vivo evidence shows that focal adhesion formation requires R2R3 to mature ( Goult et al . , 2013 ) . Preliminary analysis by Goult et al . , 2013 shows that RIAM binds to R2 , R3 , R8 and R11 , and figure 1 demonstrates that these coincide with vinculin binding sites . 47 | P a g e Figure 1 3 . 1 . 2 - Vinculin Vinculin is a 1066 amino acid protein with 4 N - terminal head ( Vh1 ) domains held in an autoinhibitory complex with the C - terminal tail region ( Winkler et al . , 1996 ; Gilmore et al . , 1996 ; Miller et al . , 2001 ) . Disruption of this interaction activates vinculin ( Izard et al . , 2004 ) and this disruption is induced by talin VBS ( vinculin - binding sites ) peptides ( Izard et al . , 2004 ) . The vinculin Vd1 domain is formed of two consecutive 4 - helix bundles formed of 7 helices ( figure 2 ) . The vinculin tail is a 4 - helix bundle and binds to the open face of the vinculin head ( Vd1 domain ) sustaining the autoinhibitory complex . Talin disrupts the interaction between the two domains by altering the domain topology of the N - terminal bundle of the head into a 5 - helix bundle . This is referred to as helical bundle conversion and experiments show the binding of talin is enough to induce this process ( Izard et al . , 2004 ) . Figure 1 – Schematic representation of the talin rod . The talin rod region domain consists of 13 distinct helical bundles with a C - terminal dimerisation domain . The models shown are based on the crystal and solution structures of the talin rod fragments . Vinculin binding helices are highlighted in red .

Full - length vinculin is shown in spectrum colours , and highlights the tail domain . When talin binds , the head and tail complex is disrupted and the N - terminal 4 - helix bundle becomes a 5 - helix bundle .

The α0 helix represents one of any of the talin VBS helices shown in figure 1 and all bind in the same way ( Papagrigoriou et al . , 2004 ) . 49 | P a g e 3 . 1 . 3 - The MRL proteins The MRL proteins ( Mig - 10 / RIAM / Lamellipodin ) are a family of adaptors containing Mig - 10 , Lamellipodin ( Lpd ) and RIAM ( and the Drosophila orthologue of RIAM Pico ) . Characteristically the MRL proteins contain a central RA - PH ( Ras Association - Pleckstrin Homology ) double domain ( Wynne et al . , 2012 ; Depetris and Hubbard 2009 ) . This RA - PH ( Wynne et al . , 2012 ; Hyvönen et al . , 1995 ) domain shown in figure 3 interacts with PIP2 within the cell membrane contributing to recruitment ( Wynne et al . , 2012 ) . The N - terminus of the MRL proteins has no tertiary structure , but instead is predicted to contain amphipathic helices ( Lee et al . , 2009 ) . The C - terminus of MRL proteins contain proline rich repeats ( FPPPP ) that interact with Ena / VASP homology 1 , profillin and SH3 binding motifs ( La Fuente et al . , 2004 ) . Figure 3 Figure 3 – Schematic representation of the MRL proteins . All members of the MRL family contain a tandem RA - PH double domain followed by a C - terminal proline rich sequence . The crystal structure of the RIAM RA - PH domain is shown ( Wynne et al . , 2012 ) . The RA domain is shown in yellow and PH domain ( orange / red ) . 50 | P a g e 3 . 1 . 4 - RIAM is a Rap1A adaptor La Fuente et al . , ( 2004 ) showed that RIAM over - expression induces adhesion formation , and that RIAM knockdown decreases Rap1A dependant adhesion formation . Han et al ( 2006 ) reconstructed the integrin activation pathway in cells using αIIbβ3 integrin as the principle receptor . In that study expression of constitutively active Rap1A ( G12V ) activated integrins independent of PKC ( Protein kinase - C ) , suggesting that Rap1A is downstream of PKC . Rap1A dependant integrin activation is talin dependent ; cells expressing defective talin fail to activate αIIbβ3 integrin ( Han et al . , 2006 ) . Rap1A dependent integrin activation is mediated by recruiting RIAM , and this is verified by siRNA knockdown that abolishes integrin activation ( Han et al . , 2006 ) . Therefore the MRL proteins RIAM and , possibly , Lamellipodin ( Lpd ) function as scaffolds connecting Rap1A to talin ( Lee et al . , 2009 ) . Lee et al . , ( 2009 ) showed that the RIAM - talin interaction is dependent on RIAM residues 1 - 30 . RIAM induced integrin activation is dependent on both the Rap1A - RIAM interaction and the RIAM - talin interaction . In this study , integrin activation was assessed using flow cytometry measuring PAC1 binding ( active integrin antibody ) . Integrins were only active when both the RIAM RA domain and N - terminus were co - expressed , confirming that both regions are required for integrin activation . The 1 - 30 region of RIAM was identified as the principal talin - binding site and was subsequently linked to the membrane targeting CAAX motif of Rap1A ( by use of a chimera ) . This fragment was sufficient to localise talin to the membrane and activate integrins , bypassing Rap1A dependence . The ability to activate talin is shared across the MRL family , as the analogous experiment using Lpd was also sufficient to activate integrin ( Lee et al . , 2009 ) . 3 . 1 . 5 - Chapter Aims RIAM is required and significant for Rap1A dependant focal adhesion formation . However there is no structural data on talin - RIAM interactions . Thus the first aim of this chapter is to structurally characterise the talin - RIAM interaction , as there may be contributions from other regions of RIAM . Furthermore as the focal adhesion matures the composition of the focal adhesion changes with RIAM not being present in the mature form ( Lee et al . , 2013 ) . Thus the aims of this chapter will be to biochemically assess the competition between RIAM and vinculin for talin . 51 | P a g e 3 . 2 - Results 3 . 2 . 1 - Design of RIAM fragments TBS1 is a predicted amphipathic helix that is required for Rap1A dependant focal adhesion formation ( Lee et al . , 2009 ) . RIAM fragment 1 - 30 ( TBS1 ) contains a region that binds to R2 , R3 , R8 and R11 ( Goult et al . , 2013 ) . The RIAM N - terminal region ( 1 - 174 ) is unstructured but includes 3 fragments with high helical propensity , one of which coincides with TBS1 ( figure 4 ) . Similar to TBS1 , helices formed in the other two - regions ( 53 - 88 and 151 - 173 ) would be amphipathic . Therefore these regions are good candidates for additional interactions with talin . To test this hypothesis we expressed a range of fragments from the RIAM N - terminus . RIAM 45 - 127 was chosen as it includes two potential helical regions and a large region of random coil in the case of incorrect prediction . RIAM 1 - 127 was also selected as it contains all helical regions up until 147 - 174 . RIAM fragment 147 - 174 was expressed , as it corresponds to the third helix . The location of the hydrophobic residues are shown in figure 4 and highlighted in red .

TBS1 45 127 147 174 1 52 | P a g e 3 . 2 . 2 - Expression and purification of RIAM fragments RIAM fragments were cloned from a codon optimised template purchased from Geneart to increase yield in E . Coli . To increase the chances of successful expression , N - terminal Sumo and MBP fusions were used . RIAM fragments 45 - 127 ( 8 . 2kDa ) and 147 - 174 ( 3 . 3kDa ) were expressed in pOPINS that introduces the N - terminal His - Sumo fusion tag . Expressions of Sumo fusions proteins have the added advantage of a flush cleavage site with no cloning artefacts , as well as increased solubility . Once fully purified , RIAM 45 - 127 yielded 8mg / litre from a 1litre culture grown in 2YT media . RIAM 147 - 174 yielded 4mg / litre of a 1litre culture grown in 2YT medium . In both cases expression levels provided enough protein to use in titration studies . RIAM 1 - 127 was expressed with an N - terminal MBP fusion ( pOPINM ) . MBP is the most soluble of the fusion tags and often improves the stability of unstructured proteins . RIAM 1 - 127 ( 13 . 82kDa ) was exceptionally low yield with 1mg / litre in 2YT medium . This protein often required the purification of > 20 litres of culture to attain a usable yield . Expression in 2M9 media usually resulted in a 40 % reduction in yield . Proteins were shown to be > 95 % in purity as visible by SDS - PAGE electrophoresis , using Tris - tricene gels to improve isoelectric focusing of low molecular weight unstructured peptides ( figure 5 ) . The data in this section established the expression and purification protocols of RIAM fragments for subsequent structural analysis .

Molecular weight was predicted using Prot - param ( Gasteiger et al . , 2010 ) . Samples were independently verified by mass - spec courtesy of Dr Mark Wilkinson ( University of Liverpool ) . The sample of RIAM 45 - 127 shown in this figure was fully assigned in section 3 . 4 . 53 | P a g e 3 . 2 . 3 - NMR analysis of RIAM fragments 15 N - 1 H - HSQC data provides detail on the environment of both protons and nitrogen atoms in a macromolecule . The resonance distribution on a 1 H - N 15 2D - HSQC ( Bodehausen et al . , 1980 ) experiment provides data on the folded state of the protein as well as revealing potential artefacts of protein expression including truncations or degradation . Figure 6 Figure 6 - 1 H - 15 N HSQC spectra of RIAM fragments . All RIAM fragments are at 100µM and in 20mM PO 4 , pH 6 . 5 , 50mM NaCl , 2mM DTT . A ) Spectrum of RIAM 147 - 174 , B ) Spectrum of RIAM 1 - 127 shown in blue overlaid with Spectrum of RIAM 45 - 127 in red . Characteristic regions of chemical shifts are indicated by the dashed lines . Green lines mark the region corresponding to structured proteins , black lines correspond peaks associated with random coils . Spectra were collected at 298k at field strength of 600MHz . 1 H 1 H N 15 N 15 54 | P a g e Figure 6 shows the 1 H - 15 N HSQC spectra of RIAM ( 45 - 127 ) , RIAM ( 1 - 127 ) and RIAM ( 147 - 174 ) . The HSQC spectra of all fragments show well - dispersed resonances with 1 H chemical shifts distributed between 7ppm and 9ppm . Well - dispersed NH resonances that have diverse chemical shift values are consistent with a folded protein . Wishart et al ( 1998 ) and Wang et al ( 2002 ) show that random coil NH resonances usually have a chemical shift of between 8ppm and 8 . 4ppm ( black staggered lines ) . In an α - helix the hydrogen bonding stabilising the helix and the values of Phi and Psi angles will result in an up - field ( low ppm values ) deviation of the 1 H resonances from the corresponding random coil values ( Wang et al . , 2002 ) . A significant number of the HN - resonances shifted to the low field are observed for all three RIAM fragments ( figure 6 ) , suggesting the presence of helical structures within the fragments . This correlates well with the secondary structure prediction of figure 3 . More accurate analysis of the secondary structure within the fragments requires the use of 13 C chemical shifts . Comparison of HSQC spectra of RIAM ( 45 - 127 ) and RIAM ( 1 - 127 ) ( Figure 6B ) shows that practically all cross - peaks of RIAM ( 45 - 127 ) either superimpose or are close to cross - peaks of RIAM ( 1 - 127 ) . This similarity of the cross - peaks positions demonstrates that free RIAM ( 45 - 127 ) has a similar conformation as the corresponding fragment within a larger polypeptide RIAM ( 1 - 127 ) . Small differences between the chemical shifts are likely caused by the free amino - group at the N - terminal of RIAM ( 45 - 127 ) , which is replaced by the peptide bond in the longer fragment . The lack of significant chemical shift differences between RIAM ( 45 - 127 ) and the corresponding cross - peaks of RIAM ( 1 - 127 ) demonstrate that the 1 - 44 region does not make any contacts with the 45 - 127 region in RIAM ( 1 - 127 ) . The additional cross - peaks in the RIAM ( 1 - 127 ) spectrum correspond to the N - terminal part 1 - 44 , absent in RIAM ( 45 - 127 ) . These resonances have a wide distribution of chemical shifts , in agreement with the presence of a helical structure in the TBS1 region ( Figure 4 ) . In combination , the spectra of RIAM ( 45 - 127 ) , RIAM ( 1 - 127 ) and RIAM ( 147 - 174 ) demonstrate that all three predicted helical structures ( Figure 4 ) are likely to be stable within the polypeptides . These helical regions are independent within the complete N - terminal region of RIAM , in agreement with the prediction of long stretches of random - coil structures between the helical regions ( Figure 4 ) . 55 | P a g e 3 . 2 . 4 - Multi - site interactions of talin The focus of this study are the talin N - terminal rod domains R2 , R3 and R2R3 ( in their native double domain ) . This region of talin is of particular interest as it contains two RIAM binding domains and four vinculin - binding sites ( VBSs ) , two vinculin binding sites in each of the domains . R2 and R3 are linked by a short flexible linker ( 5 residues ) ; their close proximity may suggest a cooperative interaction with RIAM . The presence of several regions at the RIAM N - terminus that can form stable amphipathic helices suggest a possibility of additional talin binding sites in RIAM that could further enhance the interactions . The overlap with vinculin sites could also lead to competitive interactions . We will address this question by a comprehensive analysis of the RIAM interaction with the talin R2R3 region . 3 . 2 . 5 - Talin expression Talin fragments ( R2 , R3 , vinculin and R2R3 ) were expressed and as described in Materials and Methods . Plasmid DNA was supplied by Dr Ben Goult ( University of Leicester ) . The proteins were readily soluble and expressed both in nutrient rich ( 2YT ) and minimal conditions M9 media . All proteins were expressed with an N - terminal hexa - histidine tag cleavable by TEV protease . R2 and R3 gave expression levels of 30mg / litre per culture and R2R3 yielded 50mg / litre . 3 . 2 . 6 - HSQC experiments in binding studies The 1 H - N 15 HSQC spectrum ( Bodenhausen et al . , 1980 ) has multiple advantages for use in binding studies . The chemical shift value of a nucleus is sensitive to the surrounding chemical environment . When the chemical shift of a nucleus changes in response to a ligand this is the result of a direct contact and / or conformational change in the protein on ligand binding . The process of binding is dynamic and the involved nuclei are exchanging between different environments ; this process is referred to as chemical exchange and can be used to describe the affinity of interactions . Consider half - spin nuclei ( e . g . 1 H or N 15 ) in an amino acid that is switching between two isotropic chemical shift values of A ( the free form ) and B ( the protein - peptide ) complex . If the rate of the inter - conversion is slow relative to the differences in the resonance frequencies measured in Hz ( usually corresponding to exchange rates on a second – high millisecond time scales ) between free protein and the complex then there will be two sets of resonances with different chemical shift values . These resonances correspond to the free form of the protein ( δ A ) , and the complex ( δ B ) . This exchange condition is referred to as “slow exchange” . As the system is in dynamic equilibrium then the addition of the ligand 56 | P a g e will increase the population of the bound state and the intensity of the signals of the complex . Normally “slow exchange” regimes correspond to high affinity interactions and at equimolar protein - ligand ratio all protein is in the bound state and signals of the free form disappear . This is referred to as saturation and further ligand addition has no effect on the protein signals . In intermediate exchange , the affinity is reduced and inter - conversion becomes more frequent and so on the time scale of the pulse sequence there is no favoured conformation . In this regime the exchange induces significant resonance broadening and line - shape distortion . If the exchange rate is sufficiently high a single line is observed at the chemical shift value defined by wδ A + ( 1 - w ) δ B , where w is the relative population of A . Fast exchange causes spins to experience an effective local field being the average of free and the bound states . A single signal is observed with minimal resonance broadening with the chemical shift of wδ A + ( 1 - w ) δ B . In the fast exchange regime where the binding constant K d is relatively high the weighted chemical shift values change can be tracked and fitted using the following equation and provide an estimation of K d . Where y = Δδ obs , A = Δδ∞ / 2 , B = 1 + K d / a and x = b / a . √ 57 | P a g e 3 . 2 . 7 - HSQC analysis of RIAM fragments The definitions of the exchange regimes described can be applied to the talin - RIAM interactions . 15 N labelled R2 and R3 were titrated with RIAM fragments . TBS1 was progressively titrated into 15 N labelled R2 and 15 N labelled R3 domains ( figures 7 & 8 ) . The progressive titration of TBS1 into R2 resulted in low - level overall chemical shift changes with many intensities remaining unaffected . However , some peaks have shifted significantly , with additional broadening in some cases . TBS1 induces overall low level chemical shift changes ranging from Δδ0 . 02 - 0 . 07ppm . These shift changes display low - level intensity changes , and the shift changes increased linearly with concentration even at higher peptide excesses ( 4 : 1 and 8 : 1 ) . In fast exchange the deviations from the linearity occurs at ligand concentrations that are close to K d . The maximum RIAM concentration in titrations was 800 μM ; linear shift dependence even at the end of titration signifies a weak interaction with a K d > 800μM . TBS1 was progressively titrated into 15 N labelled R3 ; addition of the peptide resulted in broadening at a 1 : 1 ratio and the broadened resonance failed to re - appear at higher ligand ratios ( 1 : 2 , 1 : 4 and 1 : 8 ) . Figure 7B shows this titration at the 1 : 2 ratio of R3 - TBS1 ; the spectral changes induced by TBS1 binding to R3 are comparable to R2 Δδ = 0 . 04 - 0 . 07ppm . However , the level of exchange broadening is significantly greater than R2 , with many resonances becoming undetectable . Initially , the resonances are broadened because the corresponding nuclei are exchanging quickly between free and bound forms , corresponding to the intermediate exchange . The persistent broadening at the high ligand concentrations may be due to the low degree of the binding site saturation , increase of the molecular weight of the complex or intrinsic exchange between different bound states . Since the slow exchange requires relatively high affinity , the concentrations used at the end of the titration should be sufficient to achieve high level of the saturation . The relatively high affinity is also supported by the strong broadening detected at low ratios of ligand to protein . The increase of the molecular weight would affect all protein signals , while the broadening is observed only for a subset of cross - peaks . These considerations suggest that the broadening at high ligand ratios is cause by the exchange between different bound forms , which persists even at high ligand concentrations . A likely reason for this is the peptide binding at different orientations , supported by a nearly symmetric distribution of the charged and hydrophobic residues in the RIAM TBS peptide . Significant broadening is induced at the peptide concentrations as low as 20 µM and R3 concentration 100 µM , and 58 | P a g e at 1 : 1 ratio very strong broadening effect was observed . This demonstrates significant population of the bound state , which can only be achieved at with K d < 100 µM . 15 N R2 and 15 N R3 were subsequently titrated to excess with RIAM ( 45 - 127 ) ( figure 8 ) . The spectral changes induced on R2 are diminished in comparison with TBS1 . Figure 8A shows R2 in a 1 : 2 complex with RIAM 45 - 127 , the addition of peptide has induced shift changes still relatively that are small Δδ = 0 . 04 - 0 . 064ppm . Many of the resonances do not change in intensity with linear shift changes , and some resonances are unaffected by ligand binding . Thus we can conclude that RIAM ( 45 - 127 ) is in fast exchange with R2 and the interaction is relatively weak with a binding constant K d > 800μM . Interactions of R3 with RIAM ( 45 - 127 ) induce similar chemical changes to the TBS1 interactions . RIAM 45 - 127 induces similar shift changes to TBS1 of Δδ0 . 1 - 0 . 13ppm . The resonance broadening observed suggests intermediate exchange similar to the effects of TBS1 with a binding constant K d < 100 μM , similar to TBS1 . Although with both TBS1 and RIAM 45 - 127 spectra resonances broaden , some central peaks remain in intensity and are subject to no chemical shift changes ; these are highlighted ( boxes ) in figures 7 and 8 . As these peaks remain unchanged this suggests both domains are still folded on ligand binding . The above experiments identify the second talin - binding site ( TBS2 ) within the RIAM N - terminus . Proximity between TBS1 and TBS1 may lead to co - operative or competitive interactions between the two domains . 59 | P a g e Figure07 Figure 7 - Superposition of 1 H - 15 N HSQC spectra of ( A ) R2 ( 100µM ) and ( B ) R3 ( 100µM ) ( red ) and spectra in the presence of 2 - fold excess of TBS1 peptide ( black ) .

There are no resonance shift changes on ligand addition therefore there is no interaction and this fragment does not bind to talin . As a consequence the fragment was ruled out of subsequent analysis .

Spectra were collected in 20mM PO 4 pH6 . 5 , 50mM NaCl , 2mM DTT at a field strength of 800MHz at 298k . 1 H N 15 62 | P a g e 3 . 2 . 9 - The TBS1 & 2 does not enhance binding to R2 or R3 So far this thesis has described two talin binding sites that have a seemingly higher affinity for R3 than R2 . As TBS1 and TBS2 are in close proximity , it is possible both regions could act simultaneously or cooperative in R3 interactions . If simultaneous , this could imply that both sites engage R3 at the same time , either cooperatively ( TBS1 and TBS2 are involved in allostery ) , or competitively . To answer these questions both TBS1 and 2 were expressed in the same construct ( TBS1 & 2 ) and titrated into molar excess of both 15 N labelled R2 and R3 . In the TBS1 & 2 titration to 15 N labelled R2 ( figure 10A ) the resonances shifted to a greater extent than for the single RIAM TBS interactions with R2 . Overall , resonances are broader and larger shift changes have been induced on ligand addition . The average weighted shift changes Δδ in this interaction range between 0 . 036 and 0 . 072 ppm . These shift changes ( marked ) small intensity change relative to the background noise . As general intensity is not significantly reduced and the chemical shift changes progress in a linear fashion over the full titration range , the exchange is fast exchange and the binding is weak . Figure 10B shows the resonance shift changes for the R3 - TBS1 & 2 interaction . The progressive addition of TBS1 & 2 to 15 N R3 induces greater exchange broadening at lower ligand ratios than the individual TBS1 and TBS2 peptides . The resonances in this interaction broadened completely at a 1 : 0 . 5 protein : ligand ratio . As the resonance broadening observed in this case is significantly enhanced relative to single RIAM fragment interactions the chemical shift changes cannot be followed . Some resonances however do remain relatively intense and are well defined in low field regions suggesting the domain is still folded . Although the more extensive broadening represents a higher affinity interaction , the number of the binding sites in TBS1 & 2 fragment is twice the number of the sites in a single TBS , which accounts for the overall affinity increase . Two binding sites in TBS1 & 2 could also contribute to the additional broadening due to the presence of a mixture of states in exchange with each - other ( figure 12 ) . Therefore R3 in a 1 : 1 complex with TBS1 & 2 was compared ( figure 11 ) with R3 in a 1 : 2 complex with TBS1 , and R3 in a 1 : 2 complex with TBS2 . As TBS1 & 2 contains 2 binding sites one would expect the broadening effects to be comparable at 1 : 1 to a single fragment at 1 : 2 . Comparison of the spectra reveals the levels of spectral changes induced are comparable with selected peaks highlighted showing similar shift changes . 63 | P a g e One can conclude , given the similarity of the changes in the HSQC spectra , that TBS1 & 2 is not binding R3 with higher affinity , rather the R3 binding sites are in exchange with R3 as explained in figure 12 .

Solid lines represent binding and dashed line dissociation . 66 | P a g e 3 . 3 - Chemical shift mapping of TBS2 interactions on R3 One of the advantages of the 1 H - N 15 spectrum is in its use with a full resonance assignment of the protein . Protein labelling with 13 C and 15 N allows transfer of magnetization through peptide bonds to reveal the connectivity between the adjacent nuclei . This allows the resonances of the backbone atoms of a protein to be traced from the C to the N terminus , and the residues assigned based on distinctive chemical shift values and sequence information . In a ligand binding experiment this allows the mapping of chemical shift changes to the specific residues , providing information on ligand binding . The BMRB ( Biological Magnetic Resonance Bank ) provides a library of both solution structures and assignments that are downloadable to users and interpreted using popular programs such as CCPN analysis 2 . 2 ( Vranken et al . , 2005 ) . The chemical shift values of the R3 domain ( PDB - 2L7A , BMRB 17332 ) were downloaded . This provides a chemical shift list of all assigned spin systems and analysis generates a synthetic HSQC spectrum . These artificial peaks are mapped onto the corresponding spin systems of a user acquired HSQC . In most cases ( and in this case ) this was relatively straightforward as the peak lists were super - imposable . Using the data from section 3 . 6 . 2 , the TBS2 interactions with R3 were mapped on to the assigned R3 domain ( figure 13 ) . The largest chemical shift perturbations ( figure 13 ) are localised to the α2 - α3 face of the 4 - helix bundle ; as chemical shift changes are the result of a change in the environment then this region likely corresponds to the TBS2 binding site . The largest chemical shift changes with Δδ > 0 . 09ppm correspond to Asn811 , Glu831 Lys841 , F813 , I839 , A860 and A866 . Smaller values of shift change with Δδ > 0 . 05ppm correspond to Gln825 , Arg82 , Thr833 , Leu848 , Asp865 , Glu872 and Lys875 . Exchange broadening effects were localised to Ser858 , Ser859 , Ala868 , Asp799 , Leu836 , Gly845 and Glu851 . This data show that the α2 - α3 face of R3 is the RIAM binding site , as chemical shift perturbation is localised to this site and dispersed across it with differential values of chemical shift changes and broadening . Similar mapping has been observed for the R3 interaction with TBS1 ( Goult et al . , 2013 ) . This demonstrates that both TBS1 and TBS2 bind to the same area on R3 , consistent with their sequence similarity . In the double TBS1 & 2 fragment the two - talin binding sites compete , causing additional broadening due to the exchange between R3 - TBS1 and R3 - TBS2 complexes . 67 | P a g e Figure 13 Figure 13 – Chemical shift mapping for 100µM of R3 titrated with TBS2 .

Spectra were collected at 298k in 20mM PO4 pH 6 . 5 , 50mM NaCl , 2mM DTT with a field strength of 800MHz . 68 | P a g e 3 . 4 - Sequential assignment of RIAM 45 - 127 Besides chemical shift mapping nuclear assignments can be used for the accurate secondary structure identification based on the carbon chemical shifts ( Wang et al . , 2002 ) . The RIAM 45 - 127 peptide is large , and secondary structure prediction implies that much of the fragment may be a random coil . Data of the carbon chemical shift in combination with 15 N and 1 H shifts will elucidate the likelihood of the corresponding spin system to be coil or structured ( Wang et al . , 2002 ) . To assign the amino acid residues of a molecular system a HSQC spectrum is first used to initialise what are termed “root NH resonances” . The corresponding Cα and Cβ within the spin system share the same NH shift values . Thus the two are correlated using the through bond experiment HNCACB . Resonances from this spectrum reveal the α and β carbons of i ( the NH spin system ) , and these correlate to i - 1 resonances and i detected in the CACBCONH spectra . The i - 1 peaks observed in CACBCONH correlate to observed i resonances in a different carbon plane in HNCACB . Eventually you construct a proverbial chain connecting all residues from the C - terminus of a protein or peptide . This same principle is shared across other spectra . HNCO spectra provide data on i and HNCACO i - 1 and i - 1 ( of the backbone carbonyls ) . HBHANH i and HBHACONH i - 1 ( α and β protons ) . Once the connections between the spin systems are accurately identified then from sequence information we can reconstruct the sequence . Figures 14 , 15 and 16 show characteristic spectra for RIAM 45 - 127 , all of the spin systems are well resolved and show intense peaks relative to the noise . The connection between Gln79 and Ser 78 is easy to figure out . Serines always have characteristic chemical shifts as the β carbon resonance has a larger shift value ( ppm ) than the α resonance ( due to de - shielding of the β carbon resonance ) . As the sequence contains only one linkage of this type this combination can only be Gln79 and Ser 78 and thus they are assigned . 92 % of TBS2 spin systems were assigned , the remaining 8 % are the N - terminal 3 residues that typically broaden out due to solvent exange with water . A central 50 HHS 52 motif was not resolvable in the final assignment , figure 17 shows the decrease in intensity approaching S52 from the adjacent A53 ; peak intensity is restored from residue 49 where the carbon resonances have returned ( figure 17 ) . Intensity decrease and resonance broadening in the 50 - 52 region suggests intermediate exchange between different conformational states , most likely due to the histidine rings forming transient hydrogen bond configurations . This effect is common is poly - His stretches . 69 | P a g e Chemical shift index ( CSI ) suggests a largely helical polypeptide with regions of helical propensity in agreement with secondary structure prediction ( Wang et al . , 2002 , BMRB , Psi - pred ) . The main helical region from CSI are residues 30 - 49 , the carbon chemical shift values of these residues show distinct deviation from random coil values ( Wang et al . , 2002 ) . There is another predicted helix from residues 20 - 24 , this helix is in proximity to the helical region 30 - 49 and may contribute to the secondary structure . 70 | P a g e Figure 14 Figure 14 - 1 H , C 13 , N 15 Heteronuclear assignment of RIAM 45 - 127 showing CBCACONH and HNCACB spectra at their respective 15 N planes .

These talin - binding sites cause enhanced broadening effects with either R2 or R3 alone when titrated . Although low affinity , R2 does interact with RIAM thus may contribute to an interaction involving both R2 and R3 in their native double domain . 1 H - N 15 R2R3 was titrated with TBS1 & 2 gradually to molar excess . The HSQC spectrum of R2R3 is well dispersed with resonances coming from both R2 and R3 domains ( figure 18 ) . Figure 18 Figure 18 – Superposition of 1 H - 15 N - HSQC spectra of 100 μM R2R3 ( red ) in complex with RIAM 1 - 127 ( black ) . A ) 1 : 0 . 4 complex of R2R3 with RIAM ( TBS1 & 2 ) ; B ) 1 : 2 complex with RIAM ( TBS1 & 2 ) ( black ) . Spectra were collected at 298k at a field strength of 800MHz . Data was collected in 20mM PO 4 pH6 . 5 , 50mM NaCl , 2mM DTT . Resonance peaks that have shifted are highlighted . 1 H 1 H N 15 N 15 75 | P a g e At a 1 : 0 . 4 ratio most of the resonances of the double - domain have broadened out , although to a very different degree ( figure 18A ) . A significant number of peaks are broadened beyond detection or just visible above the noise level . These signals correspond to the R2 peaks with the largest shift changes in R2 or exchange - broadened peaks in R3 . For the peaks that can be detected , the broadening is accompanied by chemical shift change . This group of peaks corresponds to the residues at the binding sites in R2 and R3 . The second set of peaks shows no shift change and a limited broadening , suggesting that the change is caused by the overall reduction in the mobility and not by the conformational change or direct contact with RIAM . At 1 : 1 and 1 : 2 ratios all cross - peaks show severe broadening effect , with the majority below the detection level ( figure 18B ) . This uniform effect on all cross - peaks suggests a strong reduction in the rate of overall motion of the R2 and R3 in the R2R3 fragment . If the domains retained their relative independent motion , the increase in the molecular weight on the complex formation would be insufficient to account for the degree of broadening . This suggests that TBS1 & 2 binding to R2R3 either restricts the relative mobility of the domains or cross - link R2R3 fragments . The lack of significant spectra changes after 1 : 1 ratio demonstrate the saturation of the binding sites at the equimolar concentration , corresponding to a higher affinity of the interaction than that for the isolated R2 and R3 domains . 76 | P a g e 3 . 5 . 2 - Analytical gel filtration of RIAM - talin complexes – TBS1 & 2 interactions with R2R3 enhanced resonance - broadening effects visible by HSQC . As both domains broadened out this suggests both R2 and R3 are contributing to an overall interaction with TBS1 & 2 . To test the hypothesis that R2 could contribute to an interaction with RIAM analytical gel filtration was first employed . If a protein complex is formed with high affinity then it will co - elute with its binding partner . The co - elution volume depends on the concentration of the constituent binding partners . When a complex is loaded onto FPLC it is diluted 3 to 4 fold . Thus the complex eluted is more dilute than the sample loaded , as a result proteins in a complex will dissociate during this process . At a higher concentration there will be less dissociation so the complex will have a smaller elution volume . At lower concentration there will be more dissociation so the complex will form but have a larger elution volume . RIAM - talin complexes were mixed assuming a stoichiometry of 1 : 1 and were subsequently loaded at decreasing concentrations ( beginning at 75μM then 37 . 5 μM and then 18μM ) to observe complex dissociation . R2R3 - TBS1 & 2 was the most stable with co - elution observed even at 18μM concentration . At the same concentration R3 and RIAM dissociated and R2 does not even significantly shift on gel filtration with RIAM ( at 75μM ) . Protein complexes are visualised using SDS - PAGE gels that accompany elution traces ( figure 19 ) . The data reveals that the presence of the R2 domain is reducing the dissociation between talin and RIAM TBS1 & 2 . Thus the presence of R2 , a domain with low affinity for RIAM is significantly increasing the affinity for RIAM in the R2R3 double domain . This data thus raises a possibility that perhaps R2 and R3 are required for high affinity interaction with RIAM . This is in agreement with HSQC data leaving only stoichiometry and the binding constant to be determined . 77 | P a g e Figure 19 Figure 19 - Analytical gel filtration performed on a Superdex 10 / 200GL column using 20mM Tris pH 7 . 4 , 150mM NaCl , 2mM DTT .

Elution fractions are labelled accordingly . In figure C control run of RIAM is shown in green and R2 brown . 78 | P a g e 3 . 5 . 3 - Stoichiometry and affinity of talin - RIAM interaction The data in the above sections has described how not only does a TBS1 & 2 - R2R3 interactions increase broadening by HSQC , but the presence of R2 reduces dissociation on gel filtration . To determine both stoichiometry and binding affinity between RIAM fragments ITC ( Isothermal titration calorimetry ) was used as it provides thermodynamic information on intermolecular interactions . The binding affinities determined by ITC show R3 binds to TBS1 with a K d of 36μM ( figure 20 ) , whereas interactions with R2 are at least an order of magnitude weaker as determined by the relative chemical shift changes observed in section 3 . 2 . 7 . In contrast , TBS1 & 2 has a binding constant observed to be > 10 times greater than this , K d = 1 . 82 ± 0 . 2 μM . The stoichiometry of binding inferred from the data is 1 : 1 ( n = 0 . 8 ) . This stoichiometry was confirmed by use of SEC - MALLS ( Size Exclusion Chromatography - Multi Angle Laser Light Scattering ) in figure 20A . SEC - MALLS provides accurate data on the molecular weight of protein complexes in solution , not biased by the shape of the molecule . The molar mass distribution across the peak is 40kDa and this is consistent with a 1 : 1 complex being the sum of the predicted molecular weights of RIAM ( TBS1 & 2 ) ( 14kDa ) and R2R3 ( 26kDa ) . The HSQC broadening observed in section 3 . 5 . 1 showed broadening of both domains and this is consistent with a hypothesis suggesting both domains are involved in the interaction . The interaction between R2R3 is endothermic , with an enthalpy increase ( ΔH = 2 . 5±0 . 5kcal / mol ) compensated for by the change in entropy ( TΔS = 10 . 1±0 . 6 kcal / mol ) ; this is consistent with the engagement of a hydrophobic interface . 79 | P a g e Figure020 The data presented here show that the double - domains of RIAM and talin form a high affinity complex with a 1 : 1 stoichiometry . Importantly , the data shows that both domains in each fragment ( TBS1 & 2 and R2R3 ) are required for the high affinity interaction and that the interactions between single domains are much weaker .

Kd = 1 . 82µm n = 0 . 8 80 | P a g e 3 . 6 - Regulation of the talin - RIAM interaction by vinculin RIAM and vinculin both bind to the same domains on the talin rod . Del Rio et al . , ( 2010 ) showed that the unfolding of the R1R2 double domain increases vinculin binding . This unfolding of the tertiary structure is believed to reveal the VBSs buried in the hydrophobic core of the helical bundle . The individual helices then engage the Vd1 domain , inducing helical bundle conversion ( Goult et al . , 2013 ; Gingras et al . , 2010 ; Del Rio et al . , 2010 ; Izard et al . , 2004 ) . Goult et al . , ( 2013 ) showed through stabilisation ( by introduction of hydrophobic residues ) of the R3 domain , vinculin binding is reduced ; yet RIAM binding is unaffected . These data suggest that the modes of binding are incompatible - RIAM requires a folded domain , and vinculin needs an unfolded domain . The R2 and R3 domains contain 2 vinculin bind sites ( Patel et al . , 2006 ; Gingras et al . , 2010 ) . The residues involved in vinculin interactions are part of the hydrophobic core of R2 and R3 ( Gingras et al . , 2010 ) . This concept is explained in figure 21 ; vinculin - binding helices must form hydrophobic contacts with vinculin , and not the core of cognate bundle . Figure 21 Figure 21 – To reveal VBS R3 helices need to be extracted from the 4 - helix bundle they form . In the folded domain they form part of the hydrophobic core . But these residues ( labelled in red ) also mediate vinculin binding . The vinculin Vd1 domain is shown in blue . Unfolding α1 α2 α3 α4 α4 α3 α2 α1 81 | P a g e Therefore , in this study SEC - MALLS was used to examine how R2R3 stability relates to VBS availability . The vinculin Vd1 domain was expressed in BL21 * ( DE3 ) and gave a yield of 60mg / litre of culture in 2YT medium and was expressed and purified as described by ( Papagrigoriou et al . , 2004 ) . SEC - MALLS provides the opportunity to detect the molecular weight of a complex as it elutes from an analytical gel filtration column ( Superdex 75 10 / 300GL in this case ) . Molecular weight is observed as the molar mass distribution across the elution peak , and this allows the real time determination of molecular weight . The vinculin Vd1 domain has a molecular weight of 31 . 5kDa and R2R3 26kDa . SEC - MALLS was performed with the Vd1 ( 125µM ) in 5 molar excess of R2R3 ( 25µM ) both at room temperature ( 21 o C , black line ) and again with 10 minutes pre - incubation at 40 o C ( red line ) . All elution profiles were visualised using SDS - PAGE electrophoresis ( figure 22 ) . At 21 o C the molar mass distribution across peak 2 shows an 80kDa complex , this corresponds to a 2 : 1 Vd1 ( 63kDa ) / R2R3 ( 26kDa ) complex . This implies that two of the four VBS in R2R3 are available for binding . Excess of vinculin is visible as a 31 . 5kDa protein ( 3 ) . After the pre - incubation at 40 o C there are two dominant peaks ( 1 and 2 ) . Peak 1 has a molar mass distribution of 160kDa and peak 2 80kDa . The 160kDa complex represents a 4 : 1 complex between Vd1 ( 126kDa ) and R2R3 ( 26kDa ) . One of the most engaging trends of research regards the nature of vinculin binding to talin . Although there is a correlation between instability and binding ( Del Rio et al . , 2010 ) , the exact mechanism of this binding remains to be determined . If we use R2R3 as an example this point is highlighted . The α1 and α4 helices of R2 bind vinculin as do the α2 - α3 helices of R3 , with residues key to the interface held cryptic within the hydrophobic core of the protein . Figure 21 illustrates that vinculin binding involves unfolding , thus in the 2 - 1 complex ( 2 ) either R3 is saturated by Vd1 , or R2 is ( as to achieve 2 - 1 one domain must be unfolded ) . The 2 - 1 complex still remains intense at both 40 o C and 21 o . Thus it could be hypothesised that the saturation of one domain results in the reduced stability of the other . Combined with thermal denaturation the 2 - 1 complex may have a priming effect facilitating the formation of the 4 - 1 complex . 82 | P a g e Figure 22 Figure 22 - SEC - MALLS measurements performed on Superdex 75 / 10 300GL in 20mM Tris pH 7 . 4 , 150mM NaCl , 2mM DTT , Samples were loaded at 25µM R2R3 with the Vd1 in 5 molar excess . The black line represents the experiment at room temperature and in red pre - incubated complex at 40 o C . The accompanying SDS - PAGE gels show R2R3 ( 26kDa ) and Vd1 ( 31 . 5kDa ) . 1 2 3 Vd1 Vd1 83 | P a g e 3 . 7 - RIAM and vinculin compete for talin RIAM and vinculin are not found at focal adhesions simultaneously ( Lee et al . , 2013 ; Goult et al . , 2013 ) . RIAM and vinculin also bind to R2R3 ( Goult et al . , 2013 ) . Thus there may be a structural mechanism of switching between the two complexes . To examine the hypothesis of competition between the three ligands , analytical gel filtration was used . To provide the control elution volumes for each component , 50 μM of each individual protein was used . These control elution profiles are shown in figure 23 , RIAM ( TBS1 & 2 ) ( red ) , R2R23 ( black ) and Vd1 ( Green ) . Next binary complexes were tested for and these are formed between R2R3 - RIAM ( TBS1 & 2 ) ( pink ) , R2R3 and Vd1 ( light blue ) . To test for competitive interactions an equimolar sample of all three proteins was loaded ( blue ) . This shows an elution profile consistent with a lower molecular weight complex . If there was a ternary complex then the elution profile would be consistent with a complex larger than R2R3 and Vd1 ( light blue ) . If RIAM was displaced there would be a peak corresponding to free RIAM ( TBS1 & 2 ) ( red ) and the R2R3 - Vd1 ( light blue ) complex . As there is no direct displacement then it may be the case that all three proteins within the sample bind to each other with a relatively high affinity . Therefore the peak may be a mixture of talin - RIAM complexes and RIAM - vinculin complexes . As there is no displacement in favour of a vinculin - talin complex , then this experiment also implies that vinculin is binding talin weaker than RIAM . 84 | P a g e Figure 23 Figure 23 - Analytical gel filtration using a Superdex 75 / 10 300GL in 20mM Tris pH 7 . 4 , 150mM NaCl , 2mM DTT .

Therefore the analytical gel filtration of vinculin and RIAM ( TBS1 & 2 ) was performed . The elution profile of the proteins in an equimolar sample shows a shift in elution profile consistent with an increase in molecular weight . SDS - PAGE electrophoresis confirms that this peak contains a vinculin - RIAM complex . The vinculin binding helices in talin are amphipathic , as shown in figure 20 ( Gingras et al . , 2010 ; Izard et al . , 2004 ) . Thus they may have similar structural properties as TBS1 , another predicted amphipathic helix . Thus TBS1 was tested using ITC to confirm binding to the Vd1 domain . The ITC for vinculin - RIAM ( TBS1 ) interaction was performed , showing a K d = 3 . 7µM . In comparison , Vd1 domain interacts with the VBS from R3 with a K d = 800nm . 86 | P a g e Figure 24 Figure 24 – A ) Analytical gel filtration using a Superdex 75 / 10 300GL column in 20mM Tris pH 7 . 4 , 150mM NaCl , 2mM DTT .

C ) TBS1 ( 800µM ) from RIAM at 35 o C titrated in 60 µM of the Vd1 domain using 2µL injections . Data were fitted with a 1 - site model . 87 | P a g e Comparison of the isotherms reveals a substantial difference in binding constants . The talin VBS ( 820 - 844 ) engages the vinculin Vd1 domain with 5 fold high affinity than the RIAM ( TBS1 & 2 ) peptide . The RIAM TBS1 - Vd1 interaction shows ΔG = - 7 . 5kCal / Mol with an entropy driven interaction ( ΔH = - 1 . 5 kCal / Mol and TΔS = 5 . 8 kCal / Mol ) . The VBS peptide binds Vd1 with the interaction that have comparable contributions from both enthalpy and entropy with ( ΔH = - 5 . 8 kCal / Mol and TΔS = 2 . 7kCal ) and ΔG = - 8 . 5kCal / Mol . This data suggest that the Vd1 - R3 peptide is a more favourable interaction than TBS1 - Vd1 . In the R3 domain however the VBS are cryptic and an energy barrier of unfolding must be breached before engagement of the interface . Therefore a comparison of peptide binding curves is not a fair comparison between the competing binding partners . 88 | P a g e 3 . 8 - The crystal structure of the RIAM - vinculin complex To examine the hypothesis that TBS1 may be amphipathic and bind the Vd1 domain in an analogous manner to talin the structure of the complex was resolved . 3 . 8 . 1 - Protein crystallisation For crystallisation two drops were set up one of the vinculin - RIAM ( TBS1 ) complex and the other free of peptide ( TBS1 ) .

Residues 1 - 256 of the Vd1 domain were resolved excluding the N - terminal his - tag and two C - terminal residues . This is also the case for the N - terminal six residues of the RIAM peptide . The RIAM peptide is occupying the same region on the Vd1 as all other established Vd1 binding partners ( Izard et al . , 2004 , Gingras et al . , 2010 ) . The peptide inserts into a hydrophobic groove between the α1 - α2 helices on the Vd1 domain . The C - terminal helical bundle remains identical in both free and bound structures of vinculin and as to date has no established binding partners .

PDB - 1RKE ( Izard et al . , 2004 ) shows the crystal structure of the Vd1 domain from the vinculin head - tail complex . In this form the N - terminal 4 - helices form a bundle bundle between the α1 - α2 - α3 and α4 helices , upon RIAM binding there is a conformation change in this 4 - helix bundle facilitating the engagement of the RIAM peptide . 94 | P a g e RIAM changes the conformation of the Vd1 domain upon binding by forming hydrophobic contacts with the Vd1 domain . Figure 27 shows this conformational change , the α1 - α2 - α3 and α4 helices that in the Vd1 - vinculin tail ( blue ) complex adopt a 4 - helix bundle . Upon RIAM binding , the conformation changes , with the pitch of helices ( of the initial 4 - helix bundle ) changing facilitating the formation of a 5 - helix bundle . 95 | P a g e 3 . 8 . 5 - Comparison of vinculin - RIAM with the vinculin - VBS3 complex Superimposition with the template structure of the Vd1 domain in complex with VBS3 demonstrates positional differences talin and RIAM in complexes with vinculin . Figure 28 shows a structure of the Vd1 domain in complex with the VBS3 helix from talin . As with VBS3 there are 8 residues involved in the hydrophobic contacts that engage the core of the Vd1 domain . Structural based sequence alignment of RIAM and VBS3 highlight sequence similarity and differences . Marked in yellow are differences between the vinculin binding consensus sequence , and in green are residues that are similar . RIAM is different to VBS3 as it contains large hydrophobic side chains such as F12 and M19 in positions that in talin are occupied by A1954 and V1961 . The large hydrophobic moieties displace the RIAM helix from the surface of the Vd1 domain relative to the VBS3 peptide ( figure 28 ) . It is possible that the lengths of the hydrophobic side chains are the cause of differences in the binding constants ; however this hypothesis needs verification by mutagenesis ( figure 28 ) . Figure 28 Figure 28 – The crystal structure of RIAM ( Cyan ) with vinculin ( Green ) structurally aligned using PyMol with template structure PDB - 1XWJ , with the VBS3 peptide shown in purple . RIAM is displaced from Vd1 by a large phenylalanine side chain . Structural alignment of VBS3 and RIAM is shown ; residues that follow VBS consensus are highlighted in green and differences in yellow . RIAM 96 | P a g e 3 . 9 - Discussion and conclusion The data presented in the chapter show that the talin binding site within the RIAM N - terminus is extended , this extended binding site contains two amphipathic helices that engage the talin rod domains R2R3 synergistically . Synergistic interactions mechanically provide a convenient mechanism for the displacement of proteins . If we consider the example in this chapter , the presence of R2 drastically increases overall affinity for RIAM . Therefore any forced based change in orientation of R2 would result in a reduced binding affinity . These data show that RIAM and vinculin and talin interaction are competitive . This is consistent with in vivo data that show RIAM and vinculin are not co - localised at the mature focal adhesion ( Goult et al . , 2013 ) , and in vivo evidence showing the direct displacement of RIAM in favour of a vinculin rich focal adhesion ( Lee et al . , 2013 ) . Vinculin , RIAM and talin interactions are competitive , and the binding mechanisms are fundamentally incompatible ( Del Rio et al . , 2009 ; Gingras et al . , 2010 ) . Talin - vinculin binding requires rod domain unfolding , RIAM only binds to the folded R2 and R3 domains and binding will be disrupted by the domain unfolding either induced by force or by vinculin binding ( Goult et al . , 2013 ) . This is verified experimentally by our SEC - MALLS showing R2R3 destabilisation induces vinculin binding . The opposite of this is true with respect of RIAM - R3 binding ; introduction of stabilising mutations in R3 reduces vinculin binding and does not affect RIAM interactions ( Goult et al . , 2013 ) . Cryo EM ( Electron Microscopy ) and SAXS ( Small Angle X - ray Scattering ) studies have shown that talin exists in a cytosolic globular form ( Goult et al . , 2013 ) . In vivo studies have also shown that RIAM exists in a cytosolic auto - inhibited form ( Wynne et al . , 2012 ) . A potent activator of talin is the second messenger PIP2 ( Martel et al . , 2001 ) . This binds the PH domain of RIAM with a relatively weak K d of 16µM ( Wynne et al . , 2012 ) , and is considered significant as PIP2 is at high concentrations at the nascent adhesion . PIP2 can directly activate talin , therefore both talin and PIP2 could disrupt the autoinhibitory complex between the RIAM RA - PH and N - terminal domain ( Wynne et al . , 2012 ) , resulting in a synergistic activation . 97 | P a g e Figure 29 Figure 29 – Focal adhesion growth in the migrating cell . At nascent adhesions RIAM ( TBS1 & 2 ) binds talin , and Rap1A recruits RIAM to the cell membrane , facilitating integrin activation . At the transition zone integrins cluster and vinculin is recruited by talin . The central actin - binding region of talin captures retrograde F - actin ( Gingras et al . , 2005 ; Gingras et al . , 2010 ) . This force results in the displacement of RIAM in favour of vinculin . At the mature adhesion adaptor proteins are recruited to the focal adhesion to signal intracellularly . Actomyosin polarises talin , inducing conformational changes increasing vinculin binding , strengthening connections to the actin cytoskelton . 98 | P a g e The data presented in this thesis propose a model of binary switching between talin - RIAM nascent adhesions to talin - vinculin adhesions . These vinculin rich adhesions thus provide a route to focal adhesion stabilisation . In the absence of force , the data propose a model where R2R3 synergistically bind to TBS1 and TBS2 in RIAM ( figure 28 ) . This recruits talin to the cell membrane where it is activated . Here the talin FERM domain engages the NPXY motif in the β - integrin cytoplasmic tail . From this position the FERM domain binds PIP2 , providing the torsion to activate the integrin dimer ( Elliott et al . , 2010 ; Calderwood et al . , 2003 ) . The C - terminal actin binding domains of talin then bind leading edge F - actin from retrograde flow ( Gingras et al . , 2010 ) ; this will affect the compact N - terminal region and disrupt the packing of domains R1 - R6 . This will also destabilise the N - terminal rod domains , progressively revealing vinculin - binding sites and simultaneously reducing affinity for RIAM . Vinculin also binds to RIAM , augmenting the transition process . The overall effect regulates the transition from the transient RIAM rich nascent adhesion to more the stable vinculin rich adhesions ( Goult et al . , 2013 ) . On progression through the transition zone ( figure 29 ) one would expect actomyosin contraction to progressively reveal more VBSs , increasing the connection to F - actin ( figure 30 ) . Figure 30 Figure 30 – Layers of the mature focal adhesion , a talin rich layer binds to actin and to vinculin . Vinculin and talin provide the linkages to actin . This layer of proteins transmits force bi - directionally through the cell membrane ( based on diagram from Kanchanawong et al . , 2010 ) . 99 | P a g e Chapter 4 – The structure of the talin R8 - DLC1 complex . 100 | P a g e 4 . 1 - DLC1 ( Deleted in Liver Cancer 1 ) DLC1 is a Rho - GAP containing ( GTPase activating protein ) tumour suppressor protein localised to focal adhesions ( Yuan et al . , 1998 ) . DLC1 is found deficient in HCC ( Human Hepatocellular Carcinoma ) primary cell lines ( Zimonjic et al . , 2012 ; Lahoz et al . , 2008 ) and has been deleted or mutated in almost as many cancers as p53 ( Kim et al . , 2009 ) . Several studies have demonstrated that reintroduction of DLC - 1 into liver , lung or breast cancer cell lines results in decreased neoplastic growth ( Yuan et al . , 2004 ; Yuan et al . , 2003 ; Zhou et al . , 2004 ) . The DLC1 gene encodes a 1092 amino acid protein with an N - terminal SAM ( Sterile Alpha Motif ) domain and a Rho - GAP - START double - domain . The Rho - GAP - START double domain is the defining characteristic of the DLC family and is conserved across DLC 1 - 3 . The DLC1 - GAP domain is a negative regulator of the Rho GTPases and actin stress fibre formation ( Durkin et al . , 2007 ; Bishop et al . , 2000 ; Li et al . , 2011 ) . DLC1 also binds to PLCδ1 and enhances the hydrolysis of PIP2 ( Homma & Emori 1995 ) ; therefore DLC proteins may act synergistically to negatively regulate Rho - GTPase function and inhibit talin activation . Figure 1 Figure 1 - Domain organisation of the DLC1 family of proteins . The N - terminus contains SAM ( Sterile Alpha Motif ) domain and a C - terminal GAP ( GTPase activating protein ) / START ( Star - related lipid transferase ) domain . The talin - binding site is shown in red and is located between residues 460 - 490 . 101 | P a g e 4 . 1 . 1 - The R7R8 talin rod domains The R7R8 domains are sequential helical domains in the talin rod . R7 is a 5 - helix bundle and R8 is a 4 - helix bundle . The R7R8 double domain is unique in the respect that double - domain is composed of non - sequential alpha helices . Helices 1 , 2 , 3 , 8 and 9 form R7 and helices 4 , 5 , 6 and 7 form the R8 domain ( figure 2 ) . An anti - parallel linker connects R7 and R8 , and hydrogen bonding in this linker caps the R8 domain thus increasing stability ( Gingras et al . , 2010 ) . Figure 2 shows the position of R7R8 within the talin rod . The R7 domain is connected by both termini to R6 and R9 respectively ; this potentially makes the R7 domain more susceptible to force generated from the leading edge than R8 . The unusual nature of this connection also makes the R8 domain protrude from the talin rod , with as yet no known functional consequence . Figure02 Figure 2 - Domain structure of talin ( red ) . R7R8 coloured in blue are located centrally within the talin rod region and provide connection from R6 to R9 . R6 R9 1659 1359 N C 102 | P a g e 4 . 1 . 2 - DLC1 binds to talin Li et al ( 2008 ) showed by yeast two - hybrid screens that human DLC1 residues 260 - 630 binds to talin R7R8 . This region of DLC1 was already demonstrated to be a region required for DLC1 localisation to focal adhesions ( Liao et al . , 2008 ) . In vitro pull down assays of GST ( Glutathione - S - transferase ) - talin 1288 - 1646 ( R7R8 ) show complex formation with full length GFP ( Green fluorescent protein ) - DLC1 . DLC1 fragments of GFP - 1 - 492 and GFP - 448 - 500 form a complex with GST talin - 1288 - 1646 . DLC1 fragments 1 - 461 or 500 - 1091 failed to form a complex and showed that the intervening 30 - residue stretch is required for talin binding . Sequence analysis showed that this region contained the LD domain consensus motif LDxLLxxL that is shared by the focal adhesion protein paxillin ( Brown et al . , 1996 ) To determine if this region was required for the interactions deletion analysis was performed on the region 467 PELDDILYHVKGMQRIVNQWSEK 489 . Deletion of residues 469 - 474 resulted in deficient localisation to the GST - talin ( R7R8 ) fragment , suggesting that this region encompassed the talin - binding site . Section 4 . 1 . 1 described residues 1288 - 1646 contain the R7R8 double - domain and this double - domain binds to DLC1 . Shorter GST - talin fusions of various lengths ( 1500 - 1646 , 1453 - 1580 and 1380 - 1646 ) were tested via pull down and all bound to wt DLC1 . Talin regions GST - 1288 - 1510 and GST - 1288 - 1400 do not bind , and when considered within the context of the domain architecture of the talin rod , these are sub - optimum constructs that result in disruption of key helical bundles . In vivo experimentation reveals that the talin interactions do not influence Rho - GTPase activity , and deletion of the LD - motif failed to reduce Rho - GTP or Rho dependant activities . This is consistent with a hypothesis that talin localisation , and not Rho - GAP function are required for tumour suppressor activity ( Li et al . , 2009 ) . Qian et al ( 2007 ) demonstrated that introduction of a point mutation DLC1 Y442F ( in the tensin binding region ) substantially decreased DLC1 adhesion localisation ; in a double mutant of both LD deletion and Y442F , adhesion association was decreased relative to either single mutant alone ( Li et al . , 2009 ) . Thus tensin and talin make different contributions to DLC1 adhesion localisation . Given the sequence homology to paxillin LD domains , it could be speculated ( though not confirmed ) that paxillin and DLC1 compete for FAK , or one of the two sites on FAK that are capable of LD domain interactions ( Hoellerer et al . , 2003 ) . Li et al ( 2011 ) tested this hypothesis and showed that there was LD - domain dependent competition . Thus the structural basis of this interaction remains a pertinent question . 103 | P a g e 4 . 1 . 3 - Structural basis of LD domain interaction DLC1 binds to talin through an LD - like motif . This small peptide motif is defined from the consensus sequence LDxLLxxL . This motif is present in the paxillin super - family and orthologues such as Hic - 5 and leupaxin ( Brown et al . , 1996 ) . The structural basis of LD interactions is of interest due to specificity of intermolecular interactions . The LD motifs specifically bind to multiple proteins , including FAK , GIT , vinculin , actopaxin , and integrin - linked kinase ( Hoellerer et al . , 2003 ; Brown et al . , 1999 ; Nikolopoulos 2000 ; Nikolopoulos 2001 , Brown et al . , 1996 ) . The vinculin tail binds to paxillin LDs 1 , 2 and 4 , whilst FAK only binds paxillin LDs 2 and 4 ( Brown 1996 ; Brown et al . , 1999 ) . The specificity of LD motif interactions is even maintained when LD motifs are displayed in the context of full - length paxillin ( Manetti et al . , 2012 ) . The β - integrin binding protein merlin binds to paxillin LDs 3 - 5 and is responsible for membrane recruitment ( Manetti et al . , 2012 ) . LD domains have been shown by crystallographic and NMR studies to be amphipathic alpha helices . The structural basis of LD - domain interactions demonstrates the formation of a 5 - helix bundle with the LD peptide , occupying the open face of a 4 - helix bundle ( Hoellerer et al . , 2003 ) . Thus the DLC1 LD - like motif would be expected to bind talin via a similar mechanism . 4 . 1 . 4 - Aims The aim of this study is to structurally evaluate DLC1 talin interactions . No evidence currently maps the contribution of either R7 or R8 in the double domain . Additionally the extent of the talin binding site in DLC1 is unknown . Thus this chapter will map the binding sites of both talin and DLC1 . Once characterised , the structure of the complex will be determined . This will provide the basis of talin - LD domain interactions and provide details of the interface that will allow subsequent design of talin mutations that selectively disrupt DLC1 binding . . 104 | P a g e 4 . 2 Results 4 . 2 . 1 - Protein expression and purification Both talin R8 and R7R8 polypeptides were expressed in pET151D . Plasmids were supplied courtesy of Dr Ben Goult ( University of Leicester ) . Protein was expressed in BL21 * ( DE3 ) , cells were grown at 37 o C and induced using 500 μM IPTG at 18 o C overnight . Protein was purified by nickel affinity chromatography and the hexa - histidine tag was removed by TEV - protease . The protein was further purified by reverse purification and anion exchange chromatography . The yield for 1 litre of culture grown in 2YT medium was 85mg / litre ( culture ) for R7R8 and 42mg / litre of R8 . Isotopic labelling of protein resulted in a 40 % reduction of yield when expressed in 2M9 medium . Typical protein purity of R7R8 and R8 is above 95 % as shown by SDS - PAGE electrophoresis shown in figure 3 .

Gels shown are at various levels of de - stain . 105 | P a g e 4 . 2 . 2 - Secondary structure prediction of the LD domain Li et al ( 2011 ) showed the deletion of a 469 LDDILYHV 476 region in the central region of DLC1 abolished talin interactions . Multiple studies reveal that the average length of an LD motif is around 12 - 14 residues ( Brown et al . , 1996 ; Hoellerer et al . , 2003 ) . Furthermore Hoellerer et al ( 2003 ) showed that LD interactions are dependent on the engagement of an α - helix . To ensure the full α - helical region was used in subsequent binding and crystallographic studies , secondary structure prediction was performed on the region 450 - 521 using Psi - pred ( Buchan et al . , 2010 ) ( figure 4 ) . This prediction showed that the full helical region may be larger and contains 23 residues 467 PELDDILYHVKGMQRIVNQWSEK 489 . Construct design was stopped at the K488 as this could provide a helical cap , and also the addition of a terminal phenylalanine could result in peptide instability . Figure 4 Figure 4 - Consensus secondary structure prediction of the DLC1 region 469 - 489 shows helical propensity . Secondary structure prediction was performed by the PSI - PRED online server ( Buchan et al . , 2010 ) . 106 | P a g e 4 . 2 . 3 - DLC1 engages the R8 domain Li et al ( 2011 ) showed via pull - down that talin 1453 - 1580 ( R8 ) binds to DLC1 with similar efficacy as 1288 - 1656 ( R7R8 ) . This suggests binding is specific to the R8 domain ( as both constructs contain R8 ) . This does not strictly rule out R7 , however , as GST based pull downs are not as sensitive as 1 H - N 15 HSQC measurements in detecting potential weak intermolecular interactions . 1 H - N 15 labelled R8 was titrated at various ligand ratios of the 467 PELDDILYHVKGMQRIVNQWSEK 489 peptide . 1 H - 15 N HSQC spectra show resonance shift changes with DLC1 - R8 binding . The resonance shift changes associated with the ligand binding reflect an intermediate exchange regime between the free and the bound state ( see chapter 3 for more information on exchange regimes ) . Figure 5 shows the effect of the peptide addition on the R8 resonances at different titration points . The addition of the peptide results in combined shift changes between Δδ = 0 . 1 - 0 . 19ppm . Between titration points ( 1 : 1 and 1 : 2 ) intensity of resonances are reduced . This reduction reflects the exchange broadening arisen due to chemical shift differences between the free and the bound states . At 1 : 4 and 1 : 8 ratios the resonances representing the complex are increasing in intensity and the degree of shift changes between points is becoming smaller . This shows that the effects of peptide addition are non - linear and approaching saturation . At a 1 : 8 ( protein - peptide ) ratio the entire population of labelled material in the sample is in a complex with the ligand , thus the resonance shifts detected are resonating from the complex . 107 | P a g e Figure 5 Figure 5 - Changes in the 1 H - N 15 HSQC spectra of 15 N - labelled R8 ( 100 µM ) on addition of DLC1 .

The R7R8 structure has been previously solved ( Gingras et al . , 2010 ) and the unbound fragment readily crystallised in multiple conditions , maximising chances of successful crystallisation . Two drops were set up for R7R8 alone and R7R8 mixed with a 4 - fold excess of the LD peptide . This initial screen failed to yield any complex crystals ; only amorphous aggregation and quasi - crystals were detected . It is possible that the dilution of a 1 : 1 drop may drive equilibrium away from complex formation . Thus the complex was re - screened at a high ligand ratio of 8 : 1 , as NMR suggests that this ratio is the saturation point ( 2 . 4mM ) . These screens typically yielded crystals overnight in 1 condition , 15 % Ethanol , Tris pH 7 . 4 at 4oC , and were optimised using a variety of alcohols and pH . Optimisation screens varied pH ( 6 . 8 - 7 . 4 ) and alcohol concentrations ( 12 % - 20 % ) , testing ethanol , methanol and isopropanol . Crystals adopted a hexagonal rod morphology with the size of 80µm - 300µm ( figure 6 ) . No crystals were observed in drops not containing peptide or at room temperature , indicating that the complex had likely crystallised . However , this is not verified until diffraction data is collected . Figure 6 Figure 6 - Crystals yielded through optimisation of DLC1 - R7R8 complex crystal at 4 o C optimisation varied alcohol type and concentration ( v / v ) . Crystal varied in size and morphology . In ethanol , crystal size increased at lower alcohol concentrations . Large 300 micron crystals were observed in Tris pH 7 . 4 20 % Methanol . Under the same pH and buffer conditions using 20 % Isopropanol smaller hexagonal crystals were observed . 109 | P a g e 4 . 3 . 2 - Data collection Crystals grown in 15 % Ethanol , Tris pH 7 . 4 at 4 o C were prepared for cryo - crystallography by vitrifying both crystals in sodium malonate pH 7 prior to data collection . Various other cryo conditions were tested ( Paratone - N - Oil , Silicone Oil , Mother Liquor + 20 % glycerol or ethylene glycol ) and these all resulted in 6 - 8Å diffractions data . Sodium malonate was the only successful condition and diffraction data were collected on I04 ( Diamond light source 0 . 975Å fixed wavelength ) to 1 . 8Å . Owing to the high quality of the diffraction images , a 0 . 2 o non - overlapping oscillation width was used per image and a total of 180 o of data were collected on a PILATUS 6M - F detector . The integration statistics show that the data is 100 % complete within the resolution range with respectable R merge ( 0 . 654 ) , I / σ ( 3 . 1 ) values with high redundancy . 4 . 3 . 3 - Structural determination in p3 1 2 1 Diffraction data were integrated using MOSFLM ( Powell et al . , 2007 ) . POINTLESS ( Evans et al . , 2006 ) suggested a p3 1 2 1 space group owing to systematic absences and re - indexed the data accordingly before the intensities were scaled using SCALA ( Evans et al . , 2006 ) . Using PHASER ( McCoy et al . , 2007 ) a search of all space groups and enantiomorphs yielded the solution in p3 1 2 1 . Data was then re - integrated in p3 1 2 1 and scaled ; the scaled data were then used for molecular replacement again . The initial molecular replacement using only R7 yielded scores of LLG = 363 TFZ = 22 . 7 indicating a correct solution . R8 was visible in the weighted difference map and subsequently positioned and refined ( figure 7 ) . Once the R8 domain had been built into the structure molecular replacement performed again yielded more favourable statistics LLG = 7467 TFZ = 60 . 8 and an R value of 29 , confirming the correct solution ( once all features of the search model are included ) . Models were built using COOT ( Emsley and Cowtan 2004 ) , which on refinement revealed side chain detail of the DLC1 peptide . This is shown in figure 8 demonstrating the molecular replacement solution and refined electron density of W486 and H475 . These residues provided the markers required for determining the registry of the peptide and its subsequent assignment . Data were refined using PHENIX ( Adams et al . , 2002 ) , for TLS refinement rigid bodies encompassed the DLC1 peptide ( body 1 ) and the R7 and R8 domains ( bodies 2 & 3 ) . Water molecules were added using COOT ( Emsley and Cowtan , 2004 ) and PHENIX . refine at positions where peaks were greater than 1 . 0 σ in the 2Fo - Fc weighted map and greater than 3 . 0 σ in the Fo - Fc weighted difference map .

There is one R7R8 and one DLC1 molecule within the asymmetric unit and a corresponding solvent content of 55 % . The structure shows that the DLC1 peptide is bound to the R8 domain ; all of the residues of R7R8 were visible in the crystal structure apart from the flexible cloning artefacts of the TEV cleavage site . The R7 five - helix bundle follows the standard up - down topology observed in the non - bound crystal structure of R7R8 ( Gingras 2010 ) . R8 follows the standard left handed up - down twist topology consistent with all 4 - helix bundles within the talin rod ( Goult et al . , 2013 ; Goult et al . , 2009 ; Goult et al . , 2010 ) . These two helical bundles are linked by a flexible inter - domain linker that due to hydrogen bonding remains stable and well resolved in this crystal structure at 1σ ( Gingras et al . , 2010 ) . The DLC1 peptide lies across the α2 - α3 of R8 and thus the complex forms as a new 5 - helix bundle . Figure 9 shows a structure - based sequence alignment using CCP4MG ( Mc Nichols et al . , 2011 ) between bound and un - bound structures . Analysis of the backbone RMSD of R8 values reveals there is no significant change in the R8 domain ( figure 10 ) . The minor change in RMSD ( 2Å ) is characteristic of LD - domain interactions with 4 - helix bundles ( Hoellerer et al . , 2003 ) and is suggestive of a pre - existing binding site . Furthermore , as there is no change in RMSD , the conformational change between domains is a result of crystal packing , the saturated complex facilitating the change in space group ( P3 1 2 1 bound , P2 1 2 1 2 1 unbound ) . The R7 and R8 domains are connected through a flexible linker ( 1452 - 1461 and 1579 - 1589 ) that adopts a pseudo anti - parallel beta sheet that is stabilised by hydrogen bonds ( figure 10 ) . L1461 and F1581 in the apo - form have a hydrogen bonding distance of 2Å . These two residues rotate in the bound structure and the hydrogen bond distance remains intact capping the termini of R8 . 114 | P a g e Figure 9 Figure 9 – Comparison of the crystal structure of free R7R8 ( blue ) and the R7R8 - DLC1 complex ( red ) the peptide of DLC1 is shown in cyan .

Figure 11 180 o A B 117 | P a g e 4 . 4 . 2 - The DLC1 peptide structure in the complex The DLC1 peptide forms an α - helix and this is consistent with the secondary structure prediction of the region ( figure 4 ) . Secondary structure prediction shows that the helix may include a C - terminal phenylalanine residue that could stabilise the C - terminus of the alpha helix . In the crystal structure of the complex the C - terminal region of the peptide becomes non - helical approaching W486 and then appears to be unstructured . The overall secondary structure is consistent with the LD domains from paxillin that also form α - helices ( Hoellerer et al . , 2003 ) . The two faces of the peptide are shown in figure 11 using surface charge representation of both faces of DLC1 . If we examine the sequence of the peptide shown in figure 11 then we can observe certain sequence characteristics of the peptide . Short hydrophobic residues are found at the N - terminus of the DLC1 peptide and these form an interface to the talin R8 domain . Whereas bulkier residues ( W486 , M479 ) dominate the C - terminus of the peptide , defining specificity for the DLC1 - talin R8 interaction ( described below ) . 4 . 4 . 3 - The peptide protein interface The DLC1 peptide lies across the α2 - α3 face of the R8 domain helical bundle ( figure 12 ) . The hydrophobic contacts that form the DLC1 binding site on talin α2 - α3 faces are shown in figure 12 . The binding site on talin comprises hydrophobic residues exposed on the surface of R8 ( leucine , alanine and valine ) residues ( figure 12 ) . DLC1 binding specificity is mediated by a C - terminal 486 WSEK 489 motif on the DLC1 peptide . E488 engages in a mid - range electrostatic network with R1523 and K1530 , W486 appears to engage the hydrophobic C δ 1510 of R1510 . Li et al ( 2011 ) showed that the talin - DLC1 interaction requires the 469 LDDILYHV 476 region and deletion of this region reduces interactions ( Li et al . , 2011 ) . Thus the N - terminal residues of the peptide could0contribute0to0the0stability0of0binding0helix .

These residues were individually mutated to alanine to investigate whether insertion of a short hydrophobic side chain may disrupt the interaction and remove hydrogen bonds . Expression levels , purification and purity were identical to those achieved in figure 3 section 4 . 2 . 1 . The effect of these mutations on the R8 structure has been assessed using HSQC spectra . The K1530A single mutant exhibits well - distributed resonances in the low and high field regions associated with a folded protein . Many resonances superimpose and show that the presence of the mutation has not affected the integrity of the fold ( figure 13A ) . Experiments were carried out in identical conditions as the initial R8 titration with the same experimental parameters . With K1530A resonances intensities were diminished compared to noise level . The reduced intensity ( relative to the wild type spectra at the same concentration ) indicates that the total amount of correctly folded protein is reduced in the sample relative to intense disordered central resonances . These intense central peaks ( 6 - 8 ppm ) are consistent with degraded or truncated forms of the protein that may be an artefact of the expression system . Nevertheless , when titrated in a 1 : 0 . 5 ( figure 14 ) ration to DLC1 , the resonances corresponding to native sample attenuate suggesting protein and peptide still bind to each other . Due to material constraints and the inconsistent nature of the sample , determination of the exchange regime was not confirmed . In contrast , the R1523A single mutant reveals peaks of similar intensity to the wild type protein ( under identical conditions ) . Thus , the protein is not degraded to the same extent and provides valuable binding data ( figure 15 ) . Unlike the wild type titration , where resonances disappear and then return , the maximum broadening of this titration is observed at a 4 : 1 ligand excess . During the titration the shift changes are linear and resonance broadening is less extensive and shifted to the higher protein to peptide ratios ( figure 15 ) . This suggests that the protein is far from saturation and the exchange regime significantly faster than for the wild type titration . These two factors indicate a reduced affinity of the R1523A mutant . However , comparable changes in the NMR spectra between the mutant and the wild - type protein imply that the affinity reduction is relatively small and is unlikely to cause a biologically significant effect . 120 | P a g e Figure 13 Figure 13 - Changes in the 1 H - N 15 HSQC spectra of 100µM R8 ( red ) in comparison with mutants A ) Spectra of i ) 100µM of K1530A ( black ) B ) 100µM of R1523A ( black ) C ) Shows position of mutations on the α3 helix of R8 .

Mutation of R1523 to alanine reduced the affinity between R8 and DLC1 and changes the exchange regime from intermediate to fast . Thus charge reversals may be introduced to abolish interaction completely in this region . Acidic charges should be introduced across the face of the helical bundle . This charge reversal would have the effect of repulsion rather than the removal of hydrogen bonds ( figure 16 ) Figure 16 Figure 16 – Suggested mutations that will be introduced to abolish R8 interactions with DLC1 . Suggested mutations have blue surface surrounding them and this signifies the potential mutations on the surface . 124 | P a g e 4 . 4 . 5 - Comparison of R8 with focal adhesion kinase The LD domains of paxillin bind to several proteins , including the FAT domain of focal adhesion kinase ( Hoellerer et al . , 2003 ) . Like the talin R8 domain the FAT domain of FAK is a 4 - helix bundle . If we look at figure 17 we can see that both follow the left hand up - down twist topology , common to the talin 4 - helix bundles ( Gingras et al . , 2010 ; Goult et al . , 2010 ) . This topology sees the α2 helix follow α1 in an anti - clockwise manner ( figure 17 ) . Both of these structures are similar and superimpose with an RMSD of 2Å . The paxillin LD4 - helix binds to both α1 - α4 and α2 - α3 faces of the FAT domain and this is shown in figure 18 . Thus it would be structurally interesting if R8 could achieve this dual occupancy . To examine the hypothesis , the surface charges of R8 were compared with FAK . Figure 18 uses the same structural alignment from figure 17 and shows the surface charge distribution of the α1 - α4 and α2 - α3 of both R8 and FAK . Both α2 - α3 face on FAK and talin contain large hydrophobic patches capable of engaging hydrophobic helices . If we compare the α1 - α4 faces , however , there are differences . The R8 α1 - α4 face contains multiple negative charges ; this will repel any hydrophobic moieties . Thus we can conclude from structural comparison that the α1 - α4 face on talin is unlikely to bind an LD domain . DLC1 also binds to FAK ( Li et al . , 2011 ) thus DLC1 may bind to the analogous α2 - α3 face on the FAT domain . Thus structure based sequence alignment using CCP4mg was performed , Figure 19 shows this alignment with surface charges of FAK ; we can observe in this structure that although R8 and FAK follow the same topology and that DLC1 is orientated in an opposing direction to the LD domain . It is possible that the DLC1 peptide may occupy two sites on FAK , however this hypothesis needs to be verified structurally . 125 | P a g e Figure 17 Figure 17 – Like talin , the FAT domain of focal adhesion kinase adopts a left - handed up down twist topology , and these two domains superimpose . R8 is shown in red and FAK is shown in blue . In the left - handed twist topology the α1 , α2 helices follow each other in an anti - clockwise manner .

A B Talin R8 FAK 180 o 180 o N C N C 127 | P a g e Figure 19 Talin is composed of 62 helices and early domain mapping of the rod region proved challenging . One of the challenges was the incorrect prediction of domain boundaries and this led to the structure of the helical bundle R10 initially being thought of as a 4 - helix bundle ( Gingras et al . , 2006 ) . Closer examination of the sequence then led to this domain actually being classified as a 5 - helix bundle and the structure was solved ( Goult et al . , 2010 ) . This additional helix ( α0 ) ( figure 19 ) adopts a position on the α2 - α3 face on R10 , if we perform a structural based alignment with the R8 - DLC1 complex we can observe some interesting similarities . The α0 helix is orientated in the same direction and binds to the analogous site as DLC1 . The presence of the α0 helix in R10 increased relative stability of the bundle by concealing a hydrophobic patch . Thus this may represent a general mechanism of 4 - helix bundle binding interactions . Figure 19 - Structural superimposition using CCP4mg of the R8 domain and FAK ( PDB - 10W7 ) . Both domains share the same left handed up down twist topology . The DLC1 peptide ( cyan ) is orientated in an opposite direction to LD4 on the α2 - α3 face of the 4 - helix bundle .

In this chapter we solved the structure of R8 in complex with the LD - like motif of DLC1 , identifiying talin - R8 as a DLC1 binding protein , through a combination of NMR and X - ray crystallography . Using NMR a high affinity interaction with the R8 domain was measured , and using X - ray crystallography the structure was resolved to 2 . 1Å by molecular replacement . Although LD domain interactions are traditionally associated with paxillin , in this thesis the identification of the DLC1 LD - like motif reveals this motif is more widespread than previously thought . R8 engages the DLC1 peptide on its α2 - α3 face , and the DLC1 peptide engages talin with uncharged moieties from its N - terminal region and a specific WSEK motif approaching its C - terminus . The DLC1 peptide is coordinated to the surface of R8 by electrostatic contacts between E488 ( DLC1 ) and K1530 and R1523 from the R8 surface . Mutation of R1523 results in a diminished interaction . Unfortunately this interaction is not disturbed to the point of no binding , and will require further negative mutations to abolish . The LD domain interactions of paxillin tend to be mediated by short chain hydrophobic residues with no side chain engagement of the helical bundles ( LD4 and focal adhesion kinase ) . In this structure we show the insertion of a tryptophan into the hydrophobic cavity on the R8 surface ; this suggests a potential specificity of the DLC1 LD - like motif derived through a 486 WSEK 489 motif . This differs from canonical LD motif interactions , as they can be promiscuous with their orientations due to hydrophobic - hydrophobic patch binding ( Lorenz et al . , 2006 ) . Multiple assays ( Brown et al . , 1996 ; Brown et al . , 1999 ) imply that there is a specificity of the LD domains in their interactions . However given high sequence similarity the degree specificity of the LD domain interactions is startling ( figure 21 ) . The vinculin tail can engage paxillin LDs 1 , 2 and 4 whereas FAK can only engage LDs 2 and 4 ( Brown et al . , 1996 ; Brown et al . , 1999 ) . 130 | P a g e Figure 21 Paxillin is ubiquitous in focal adhesions ( Brown and Turner 2004 ) , and currently there is no in vivo data revealing the specific localisation of DLC1 ( Li et al . , 2009 ) . As DLC1 negatively regulates stress fibre formation , it stands to reason that DLC1 recruitment may be one of the initiation events of focal adhesion disassembly , or rather the inhibition of further maturation through actomyosin dependent tension . There may also be a competition between talin - DLC1 and DLC1 - FAK complexes . The recruitment of DLC1 may provide a switch between focal adhesion maturation ( associations with talin ) , through to FAK interactions that begin the processes of adhesion disassembly ( Hamadi et al . , 2005 ; Ezratty et al . , 2005 ) . This would be consistent with in vivo data that shows deletion of the DLC1 LD - like motif increases levels of anchorage independent growth ( Li et al . , 2011 ) . In conclusion this thesis has structurally elucidated the intermolecular interactions between talin and DLC1 , providing the structural basis for binding specificity . In the context of LD domain interactions , this thesis has contributed to the field showing LD helices can be significantly larger . The structure of the DLC1 - LD domain complex provides the first structure of a talin rod domain in complex and shows the DLC1 peptide adopts the position of a 5 th helix along the α2 - α3 of the 4 - helix bundle . That is selectively located due to the presence of a novel WSEK motif . In the context of the mature focal adhesion , this work provides the structural basis for DLC1 localisation to talin , where it can negatively regulate actomyosin contraction . Mutations in the binding site have disturbed molecular interactions and need to be tested in vivo . If charge reversal mutations abolish interactions with DLC1 then this would be expected to induce phenotype changes associated with anchorage independent growth and tumourgenesis .

SHANK proteins interlink clusters of NMDA ( N - methyl - D - aspartate receptor ) and AMPA ( α - amino - 3 - hydroxy - 5 - methyl - 4 - isoxazolepropionic acid receptor ) receptors at the PSD to the cytoskeleton ( Saupe et al . , 2011 ) . SHANK3 ( Sharpin binding Ankyrin repeat protein ) is a 193kDa postsynaptic density adaptor protein . Mutations and deletions within the SHANK3 gene manifest themselves as mental retardation , 22q13 deletion syndrome or autism ( Durand et al . , 2007 ; Bonaglia et al . , 2001 ; De Nayer et al . , 2012 ; Verhoeven et al . , 2012 ) . Gene targeting studies in test mice confirm that SHANK3 deletion induces the development of the autistic phenotype ( Peca et al . , 2011 ; Bozdagi et al . , 2011 ; Wang et al . , 2011 ) . Pathogenic mutations are currently associated with truncations and mis - folding of SHANK3 ( Durand et al . , 2007 ) . In vivo studies by our collaborator Dr H Kreinkamp ( University of Hamburg - Eppendorf ) show that familial mutations specifically within the N - terminal region of SHANK are associated with increased interactions with the integrin regulatory protein SHARPIN ( SHANK associated RH domain containing protein ) . SHARPIN competes with talin for binding to integrin tails ( Rantala et al . , 2011 ) . Thus the aim of the chapter is to solve the structure of the N - terminal region of SHANK and elucidate its intermolecular interactions . 133 | P a g e 5 . 1 . 1 - SHANK interactions at the postsynaptic density The SHANK family of genes encodes a group of scaffold proteins key to regulation of synaptogenesis at the postsynaptic density ( PSD ) , and the regulation of dendritic cell morphology ( Durand et al . , 2007 ) . SHANK proteins contain multiple domains that can bind to cell surface receptors at the PSD and connect them to the actin cytoskeleton via cortactin ( Naisbitt et al . , 1999 ; Jiang and Ehlers 2013 ) . Thus SHANK acts in a manner analogous to talin connecting cell surface receptors to the actin cytoskeleton . Figure 1 SHANKs 1 and 3 contain the newly identified SPN ( SHANK / Pro - Sap / N - terminal ) region ( Mameza et al . , 2013 ) , this SPN region is predicted to be autoinhibitory to ankyrin domain interactions ( Mameza et al . , 2013 ) . The ankyrin domain binds to α - fodrin and SHARPIN ( Lim et al . , 2001 ) . SHARPIN is both enriched and has regulatory functions at the PSD ( Lim et al . , 2001 ) , and interactions with α - fodrin regulate connections to the actin cytoskeleton at the PSD ( Bockers et al . , 2001 ) . The SH3 domain binds to cytosolic proteins such as densins , Grip - 1 and Cav . 1 . 3 ( Jiang and Ehlers 2013 ) . One of the most functionally important regions of SHANK3 is the PDZ domain . The PDZ domain has multiple binding partners and is required for PSD formation . The PDZ domain links SHANK3 to the PSD with the C - terminus of GKAP ( Saupe et al . , 2011 ) . The proline rich linker in - between SH3 and SAM domains Figure 1 - SHANK3 domain interactions ( diagram adapted from table 2 in Jiang and Ehlers 2013 ) . SAM ( Sterile Alpha Motif - 2F3N ) , SH3 ( Serine Homology Domain 3 - 1WA7 ) , PDZ ( Post Synaptic Density Zonuna occludin - 3O5N ) and SPN ( SHANK3 / ProSap / N - terminal domain ) . Note the SH3 domain in this diagram is used from an unrelated protein the structure of the SHANK3 SH3 domain is unknown . 134 | P a g e contain multiple motifs that provide sites of engagement for actin regulators such as HOMER and cortactin . The C - terminal SAM domain regulates SHANK oligomerisation in a zinc dependent manner ( Gundelfinger et al . , 2006 ; Grabrucker et al . , 2011 ) . Increases in cytosolic zinc concentrations are associated with PSD formation ( Gundelfinger 2006 ) . GST - fusions of the SAM domain are able to pull down the corresponding un - tagged SAM - domain in vitro ( Baron et al . , 2006 ) . Thus the SHANK family has a higher oligomeric state contributing to their role at the PSD ( Grabrucker et al . , 2011 ; Naisbitt et al . , 1999 ) . Genes for SHANK proteins are all located on different loci ( chromosome 11q13 . 3 for SHANK2 and 19q13 . 3 for SHANK1 ) . The domain structures of the SHANK proteins have a high degree of diversity that are isoform specific and contribute to tissue specific function . Different combinations of intragenic promoters and alterative splicing results in a plethora of different mRNAs and isoforms ( figure 2 ) . The exact number of protein products remains unknown ( Jiang and Ehlers 2013 ) . Figure 2 Figure 2 – Diversity of alternate splice forms of the SHANK family of proteins ( based on a diagram by Jiang an Ehlers 2013 ) . 135 | P a g e 5 . 1 . 2 - SHANK3 and Autism spectrum disorders ( ASD ) SHANK3 is arguably the most implicated and studied proteins in ASD’s ( Boccuto et al . , 2013 ) . SHANK3 is heavily enriched at the post - synaptic density and a variety of mutations ( within SHANK3 ) have been implicated in familial cases of autism . An intronic donor splice from an epileptic father results in a mis - sense mutation L68P ( Gauthier et al . , 2009 ) . This mutation is predicted to potentially disrupt the ankyrin repeat and is conserved across multiple species ( Gauthier et al . , 2009 ) . Two further mutations within the ankyrin repeat sequence have been identified in ASD patients ( A224T and I245T ) ( Gauthier et al . , 2009 ) . From a structural perspective , these may disrupt the hydrophobic packing of the ankyrin repeat domain . In vivo data by the Kreinkamp group shows that the first 90 conserved residues of the N - terminal domain are inhibitory to SHARPIN binding , and in the case of the L68P mutation this inhibition is relieved , suggesting an intramolecular autoinhibitory complex ( Mameza et al . , 2013 ) . Other inherited mutations have also been identified in this SPN region that affect function . Over expression of GFP - tagged SHANK3 R12C in vivo causes reduced synaptic clustering ( Durand et al . , 2007 ; Durand et al . , 2012 ) . Thus the N - terminal residues ( 1 - 98 ) although predicted to be outside the ankyrin repeat region may contribute to the postsynaptic localisation of SHANK3 and require further investigation . 5 . 1 . 3 - SHANK3 focal adhesion interactions SHANK3 clusters at focal adhesions with typical focal adhesion markers such as vinculin , paxillin and with actin filaments ( Durand et al . , 2012 ; Qualmann et al . , 2004 ) . SHANK3 over - expression is observed to have a positive effect on actin polymerisation ; this is seen to be dependent on the presence of the C - terminal cortactin - binding domain ( Naisbitt et al . , 1999 ; Durand et al . , 2012 ; Du et al . , 1998 ) . The protein SHARPIN ( Lim et al . , 2001 ) is a SHANK binding protein that is involved in plethora of cell signalling events including the regulation of NF - κB ( Ikeda et al . , 2011 ) . SHARPIN has been implicated in the regulation of focal adhesion disassembly and inhibits β1 - integrin activation in human cancer cells and primary leukocytes . In vivo evidence shows SHARPIN is localised to the cell membrane in NCI - H460 cells and interacts with β - integrin in PC3 cells ( Rantala et al . , 2011 ) . SHARPIN deficient mice showed increased levels of integrin activity , this activity is subdued by its re - expression ( Rantala et al . , 2011 ) . 136 | P a g e SHARPIN binds to α - integrin tails and inhibits the recruitment of both talin and kindlins ( Rantala et al . , 2011 ) . SHARPIN and SHANK3 co - immunoprecipitate in both in vivo and in vitro experiments and the binding to SHANK has been mapped as between the RH domain ( predicted UBL domain ) of SHARPIN , and the SHANK3 ankyrin domain ( Lim et al . , 2001 ) . As SHANK3 and SHARPIN are co - localised , one could speculate that SHANK3 could act as a scaffold for SHARPIN recruitment ( figure 3 ) . Figure 3 5 . 1 . 4 - Aims of this chapter - The N - terminal region of SHANK remains structurally uncharacterised . The aim of this chapter is to solve the structure of SHANK3 , and based on structural elucidation predict the binding of intracellular ligands . Figure 3 – SHANK3 binds SHARPIN and may act as a scaffold for talin displacement at focal adhesions . The mechanism of SHANK3 membrane recruitment remains elusive . 137 | P a g e 5 . 2 Results 5 . 2 . 1 - Expression and Purification of the SHANK N - terminal region The Rattus norvegicus SHANK3 N - terminal domain ( 1 - 348 and 1 - 99 , 1 - 114 ) constructs were kindly provided by the Dr H Kreinkamp in pET - SUMO ( encoding N - terminal His - Sumo - tag ) . This vector was chosen to maximise solubility and expression levels . SHANK3 1 - 348 was expressed in BL21 * ( DE3 ) grown at 30 o C and induced using 300µM IPTG at 18 o C overnight . Under identical conditions residues 1 - 99 and 1 - 114 are insoluble . This is of interest as it implies the predicted ankyrin repeat fold is required to assist in the folding of the SPN region . The induction temperature and IPTG concentrations were intended to compromise high - level expression with enhanced protein folding at 18 o C . The fusion tag was removed by Sumo protease . Post Sumo cleavage the protein became prone to aggregation and precipitated upon concentration by centrifugation . To overcome this , 3 litres of culture were grown and the fusion protein concentrated through nickel affinity chromatography ( 5ml ) . At this high concentration Sumo protease cleavage was performed and after reverse purification SHANK3 ( 1 - 348 ) was immediately exchanged into 20 mM Tris pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl , 2 mM DTT . Monodispersity was verified using analytical gel filtration . The yield in 2YT was 10mg / litre of culture and was judged to be > 95 % pure by SDS - PAGE electrophoresis .

Due to the range and quality of crystals no optimisation was necessary . In figure 5 crystal forms A and C failed to diffract , crystal form D was a 50 % merohedral twin . Data was collected from forms B and E . Figure05 Figure 5 - Sparse matrix crystal screens produced a variety of crystal morphologies in multiple conditions .

Both crystals were prepared for cryo - crystallography by vitrification in mother liquor containing 30 % Ethylene glycol , 10 % Isopropanol . One crystal form produced 2 . 17Å data ( 0 . 1M HEPES pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 4M K / Na tartate ) and the other 2 . 9Å data ( 0 . 1M MES pH 6 . 4 12 % PEG - 20K ) . Data sets were collected on IO4 - 1 ( Diamond light source λ0 . 92Å ) with a non - overlapping 0 . 5 o oscillation width and a rotation of 180 o using a PILATUS 2M detector . The 2 . 17Å ( in P4 1 2 1 2 ) data set was of high quality with high I / σ ( 4 . 4 ) in the highest resolution shell and low R merge 0 . 59 . The 2 . 9Å data set was of lower resolution and quality but of interest as it may be a different yet related space group P2 1 2 1 2 1 ( I / σ 1 . 4 and R merge 0 . 85 ) . 5 . 2 . 4 - Structural determination 5 . 2 . 4 . 1 - The SHANK N - terminus ( 1 - 348 ) in P4 1 2 1 2 ( 2 . 17Å ) Diffraction data were integrated using MOSFLM ( Powell et al . , 2013 ) . Early analysis of the intensities pattern suggests the data may be P4 1 2 1 2 ( in POINTLESS ) . The space group P4 1 2 1 2 is enantiomorphic thus based on intensities can also be P4 3 2 1 2 . Molecular replacement was employed in PHASER ( McCoy et al . , 2007 ) using the small ankyrin repeat structure from PDB , ID 1N11 , with side chains removed as a template . PHASER searched all enantiomorphs and possible space groups , finding the solution to be P4 1 2 1 2 as suspected . Subsequent to this , data was re - integrated and scaled in P4 1 2 1 2 using MOSFLM ( Powell et al . , 2013 ) and then SCALA ( Evans et al . , 2006 ) . Upon refinement using PHENIX . refine ( Adams et al . , 2012 ) electron density for the full ankyrin repeat was visible and modelled using COOT ( Emsley and Cowtan , 2004 ) . This allowed the SPN domain to be visible in the weighted difference map ( figure 6 ) . Arp / Warp 7 . 3 ( Langer et al . , 2013 ) provided a template backbone for PHENIX . autosol ( Adams et al . , 2012 ) to build in the sequence . Through manual inspection of the model in COOT 0 . 7 ( Emsley and Cowtan 2004 ) all unassigned electron density was modelled , including the loop regions of the SPN domain ( figure 7 ) . This modified template was used for molecular replacement again and yielded favourable scores LLG = 15044 TFZ = 79 . 6 in p4 1 2 1 2 . The fully refined electron density map also revealed a significant amount of ethylene glycol and isopropyl alcohol from the cryo - protectant bound to the structure . These bound molecules were assigned and accounted for in the final refinement . 140 | P a g e 5 . 2 . 4 . 2 - The SHANK N - terminus in P2 1 2 1 2 1 ( 2 . 9Å ) To resolve the crystal structure of the SHANK3 in P2 1 2 1 2 1 the crystal structure in p4 1 2 1 2 was used as a template for molecular replacement yielding favourable scores LLG = 6055 TFZ = 38 . 5 . This structure differs from the structure in P4 1 2 1 2 as there are two components of the asymmetric unit . To improve agreement with experimental data at the final stages of refinement , TLS ( translation / libration / screw ) refinement strategy was used . Rigid bodies were determined using the online TLS motion determination online server ( Painter et al . , 2006 ) . Data merging and final refinement statistics are shown in table 1 . To identify the NCS ( non crystallographic symmetry ) relations in the P2 1 2 1 2 1 crystal form of SHANK3 , a self - rotation function was calculated using POLRAFN in the resolution range 15 - 5 . 5Å and a Patterson radius of integration of 12Å . The orthogonal code 3 option was used in POLARRFN with the crystallographic b axis along the orthogonal z - axis . This revealed a 4 = fold NCS axis ( kappa = 90 o ; Fig 8C , left ) co - aligned with the b * axis and contained within the ac plane at ϕ = 90 o and Ω = 45 o ( Fig 8c , right ) co - incident with the location of an equivalent crystallographic axis in the P4 22 point group . The NCS peak height is 65 % of the origin peak . This demonstrates that the NCS axis is not a true crystallographic axis and thus that this crystal form is distinct from the P4 1 2 1 2 described above . The lattices are , however , not independent and the P2 1 2 1 2 1 can be considered a sub - symmetry caused by the disruption of the 4 - fold . This could arise from deviations between structures arising from flexible loop regions between SPN and ankyrin domain creating partial differences in packing , or potentially differences in crystallisation conditions . 141 | P a g e Figure 6 Figure 6 – Refinement and modelling of the SHANK3 - SPN domain .

In P4 1 2 1 2 there is a solvent content of 68 . 7 % and one chain in the asymmetric unit , and in P2 1 2 1 2 1 ( 38 % solvent content ) ( 2 . 9Å ) there are two chains related by a 2 fold non - crystallographic axis ( figure 8 ) . In both crystal structures only the C - terminal two residues are unresolved . The novelty of the SHANK3 N - terminus lay in the new compact multi - domain arrangement of UBL and ankyrin domain . This arrangement sees a newly identified UBL ( Ubiquitin - like ) fold orientated towards the face of an ankyrin repeat domain ( from this point referred to as the SPN domain , as consistent with Mameza et al ( 2013 ) ) . To date there are no ankyrin repeats that contain this modular arrangement . This domain is located within the SPN ( 1 - 92 ) region described by ( Mameza et al . , 2013 ) and positions itself above the N - terminus of the ankyrin domain . Figure 7 Figure 7 – Ribbon representation of the SHANK3 N - terminus to 2 . 17Å angstrom . The N - terminal SPN domain connects through a flexible linker to the seven - ankyrin repeat sequences .

Solid line represents crystallographic symmetry and staggered NCS . 180 o 145 | P a g e In P2 1 2 1 2 1 mutual respective residues on each molecule engaging in the interface mediate the interaction between the adjacent chains . From one chain V345 and F305 are in a hydrophobic interaction mediated by Pi - Pi stacking with adjacent F305 and V345 residues in the second chain . The interface is further stabilised by the electrostatic interactions between E267 and R306 ( Figure 8 ) . Previous reports ( Lim et al . , 1999 ) show that SHANK3 can oligomerise . Analysis with PISA ( Krissnel et al . , 2011 ) revealed that although there is a substantial buried surface area 1280Å 2 at the crystallographic interface , formation of a multimeric complex in solution is unlikely . PISA analyses the buried surface area between proteins , searching for critical contacts . Analysis of protein interfaces has not revealed any specific interactions that could result in the formation of stable quaternary structures . Size exclusion chromatography is consistent with a globular monomeric structure with an elution volume consistent with a protein of 40kDa . It may be the case that there is a degree of contact between SHANK3 ankyrin domains , but this would be a relatively weak interaction non - resolvable by gel filtration . SHANK3 oligomerises via its SAM domain ; it may be that the contacts between ankyrin repeats could potentially contribute to dimerisation via packing of adjacent macromolecules . It may also be the case that the P2 1 2 1 2 1 dimer is a result of crystal packing and non - existent . 146 | P a g e 5 . 3 . 1 - The SPN - Ankyrin domain interface The SPN domain is located at the N - terminus of the ankyrin repeat domain . From here it positions itself above the N - terminal region of the ankyrin domain thus potentially masking this region . Because of this positioning there may be contacts that stabilise this positioning of the domain . If the hypothesis that the SPN domain is autoinhibitory to the ankyrin repeats region is valid , mutations may be a tool in disrupting this complex in vivo or in vitro . Mid - range electrostatic interactions between the SPN and ankyrin domain mediate this positioning . The Y98 and R96 side chains form electrostatic contacts with the carbonyl backbone of residues G139 and L140 ( figure 9 ) . Electrostatic interactions continue along the surface of the ankyrin repeat from H176 , D178 and R180 ( figure 9 ) . R180 and D178 are involved in electrostatic interactions that form ion pairs with the carbonyl backbone of L52 and K94 . The anchoring of the SPN domain to the ankyrin surface is a cumulative effect of multiple electrostatic contacts between the adjacent macromolecules connected through a flexible linker . When considering mutations to disrupt interdomain packing , this does not provide a clear hydrogen bond target . The cumulative effect of mid - range bond between the UBL domain and ankyrin may require charge reversals to repel the SPN domain . 147 | P a g e Figure 9 Figure 9 - The SPN region UBL domain is anchored to the ankyrin domain by mid - range ( 2Å - 3Å ) electrostatic contacts .

SHANK3 is coloured from red ( N ) to the blue ( C ) terminus . 148 | P a g e 5 . 3 . 2 - The SHANK3 ankyrin repeat domain Ankyrin repeat domains are defined as a 33 amino acid motif that results in the anti - parallel arrangement of helices ( Hollenbeck et al . , 2009 ; Sedgwick and Smeardon 1999 ) . Current literature suggests that the SHANK3 ankyrin repeat region is typical in respect that it contains 7 repeats . Most ankyrin repeat sequences contain 4 - 7 repeat sequences ( Li el al 2006 ) . The SHANK3 ankyrin domain was thus compared with existing ankyrin domains using the PDBefold online server ( Krissinel et al . , 2004 ) . The PDBefold server scores structurally homologous PDB’s in order of structural similarity . The top search results from this search are shown in figure 10 as well as a structural based alignment and RMSD values . Top scoring structural homologues included Notch ( RMSD 3 . 9Å ) , Drosophila notch ( 2 . 64Å ) , EuhMT1 ( RMSD 3 . 09Å ) and Bcl - 3 ( RMSD 3 . 09 ) ankyrin domains . The variety of functionally distinct homologues not only reflects the diverse function of the ankyrin repeat family , but its efficacy as a macromolecular scaffold and evolutionary conservation . This comparison reveals that the core repeat is homologous to almost every other ankyrin repeat . The major differences include variations of length at either N or C - terminal repeats sequences . 149 | P a g e Figure 10 – PDBefold search of the SHANK3 ankyrin repeat sequence with Notch ( PDB - 2QC9 ) , Drosophila Notch ( PDB - 2F8X ) , EuhMT1 ( PDB - 3B95 ) and Bcl - 3 ( PDB - 1K1A ) . Structural based sequence alignment was performed using CCP4mg . Figure 10 RMSD 3 . 29Å RMSD 2 . 64 Å RMSD 3 . 09Å RMSD 3 . 09Å 150 | P a g e 5 . 3 . 3 - Structural features of the ankyrin repeat The ankyrin scaffold is an array of helices packed together . Each repeat ( besides the first repeat ) has an N - terminal β - hairpin , followed by two anti - parallel alpha helices ( figure 11A ) . These anti - parallel helices pack hydrophobically , stabilising the domain . As of date , there are no examples of a single ankyrin repeat being stable ( Hollenbeck et al . , 2009 ) . The structural features of ankyrin domains vary , depending on their relative position in the overall domain . The SHANK3 N - terminal ankyrin repeat sequence is structurally distinct from the subsequent repeats . The N - terminal α1 - helix ( figure 11D ) forms a truncated helix that connects to the SPN domain . In this region there is no β - hairpin , but rather a kinked helix in which threonine 112 adopts an inward facing rotamer ( figure 11D ) . The inward facing rotamer of this T112 is unlikely to cause truncation merely occupying the space formed as a result of the helix break . The disruption of an α - helix by a side chain is thermodynamically unfavourable . The interface between the N - terminal helix ( α2 ) and its adjacent helices ( α3 , α4 and α5 ) partners is hydrophobic . The core of this region contains hydrophobic moieties from F119 ( α2 ) and L139 ( α4 ) ( figure 11B ) . F119 on the α2 helix is altering the pitch of α2 with respect to α3 . This is different from the usual hydrophobic packing observed in the central repeats that are mediated by shorter hydrophobic residues such as leucines and valines ( figure 12A ) . The C - terminus of the ankyrin repeats contain solvent exposed residues that are conserved for solubility purposes . 151 | P a g e Figure 11 Figure 11 - The SHANK3 ( 1 - 348 ) ankyrin repeat region is coloured from N to C - terminus ( from red ( N ) to magenta ( C ) ) .

SHANK3 binds SHARPIN via its ankyrin domain ( Lim et al . , 2001 ) . Ankyrin domain interactions have a tremendous structural variety and can bind proteins on multiple faces ( Hollenbeck et al . , 2009 ) . Thus examining close structural homologues of SHANK3 may give insight into a potential binding site . PDBefold search of the SHANK3 ankyrin repeat domain highlighted PDB 2F8X as the closest structural homologue . 2F8X is the ankyrin repeat from the Drosophila Notch receptor ( Nam et al . , 2006 ) and is in a complex with the protein suppressor of Hairless . In this interaction , the β - barrel of suppressor of Hairless binds to the concave face of the Notch ankyrin repeat domain . The interface between domains in this structure is mediated by β - sheet contacts with the ankyrin domain . As many UBL interactions are based on similar β - sheet interactions ( Kiel et al . , 2005 ) both SHANK and 2F8X were structurally aligned and surface charge distribution examined ( figure 12 ) . Structural alignment shows that the SHANK ankyrin repeat domain aligns with 2F8X in its ligand - binding site . Surface charges are mainly non polar on the SHANK3 domain , whereas the corresponding region on Notch has mixed charges , making this site ideal for electrostatic interactions . Many other ankyrin repeat domain interactions are charge - mediated ( Hollenbeck et al . , 2009 ) . Thus the surface charges on all the ankyrin domain faces were examined ( figure 13 ) . On side A ( figure 13 ) , there are a wide distribution of negative charges located to the posterior of the SPN domain and the ankyrin fold . The opposing face ( B ) of the ankyrin repeat ( figure 13 ) also shares this distribution of charges . Surfaces C and D ( figure 13 ) reveal that the concave face and the opposing face are largely hydrophobic . If one was to speculate , then faces A and B of SHANK3 would be the most likely to engage another protein , as in 2F8X the highly charged face of the repeat maybe the SHARPIN binding site . 153 | P a g e Figure 12 Figure 12 - Surface charge representation of ankyrin domain complexes . PDBefold search identifies PDB - 2F8X as the closest structural homologue of the SHANK3 N - terminal domain ; and surface charge representation of the proteins reveals charge distribution of the 2F8X binding site , and the corresponding site on the SHANK3 N - terminus .

SPN domain 155 | P a g e 5 . 3 . 5 - Pathogenic mutations of the SHANK3 ankyrin domain The primary focus of research surrounding SHANK3 has until now involved a comprehensive cataloguing of mutations that are associated with the pathogenesis of autism spectrum disorders . Many of these mutations are predicted to be part of the ankyrin repeat domain . The hypothesised result of these mutations is correlated with mis - folding events or truncations resulting in loss of function ( Mameza et al . , 2013 ) . Gauthier et al ( 2009 ) identified two mutations that are relevant to pathogenesis of ASD’s . These are two threonine mutations in positions A223 and I245 . It can be hypothesised that the hydroxyl group on the threonine side chains would destabilise the ankyrin fold . However , the relevance of these mutations is somewhat unclear , as this study was performed by analysing human genomes . In the rat form of SHANK3 I245T is natural and does not affect protein folding ( figure 14 ) . Given the nature of the repeat sequence it is unlikely the A223T would disrupt helical packing either ( as I245 and A223 are in analogous positions ) . Durand et al . , ( 2012 ) identified multiple de novo mutations in the ankyrin repeat sequence that have effects upon actin regulation and spine induction morphology . These mutations are R300C and Q321R . The R300C mutation could induce aberrant folding of the C - terminal repeat . The wild - type sequence is 298 CAR 300 and introduction of an additional cysteine residue could result in aberrant disulphide bond formation . Durand et al ( 2012 ) argue that Q321R results in actin accumulation in vivo , yet the residue is solvent exposed and switching to an arginine is unlikely to result in mis - folding in this position . Furthermore the actin regulatory region of SHANK3 is in the C - terminal proline - rich sequence that regulates actin through cortactin interactions . Therefore it is unlikely that this mutation has direct effects of actin polymerisation . 156 | P a g e Figure 14 Figure 14 – Location of pathological de novo mutations are mapped on to the structure of the SHANK3 ankyrin repeat region ( coloured from green ( N ) to blue ( C ) ) . SHANK3 mutations have been referenced from Durand et al ( 2012 ) and Gauthier et al ( 2009 ) . Corresponding regions of the SHANK3 ankyrin repeat have been highlighted and zoomed upon . 157 | P a g e 5 . 4 - Structural features of the SPN domain The structure of the SHANK - SPN domain is a typical β - grasp fold consistent with the ubiquitin super - family . The SPN domain has associated mutations resulting in either deficient recruitment to the PSD ( Durand et al . , 2007 ) or mis - folding events associated with ASD’s ( Gauthier et al . , 2009 ) . Analysis of the SPN domain shows the hydrophobic core of the fold is stabilised by multiple interactions between leucines and valines located on the inner face of the α1 , β4 and β1 strands ( figure 15 ) . The hydrophobic residues stabilise the core fold of the protein , and any disruption of this core would destabilise the domain . Leucine 68 is conserved in SHANK3 across all species and the structure shows L68 position as part of the hydrophobic interface that stabilises the fold . Mutation of this residue to proline would result in mis - folding of the SPN domain . Figure 15 Figure 15 - Crystal structure of the SPN domain ( spectrum colours ) . Zoom shows the hydrophobic core of the SPN domain , the 2F0 - FC map in blue mesh is superimposed at 1σ and shows electron density of L68 . 158 | P a g e 5 . 4 . 1 - SPN comparison with ubiquitin The β - grasp fold of ubiquitin is highly conserved yet highly diverse . UBL folds have been implicated in cellular events ranging from sulphur transport , adaptor protein function and even the covalent modification of side chains ( Burrough et al . , 2012 ) . Structure based alignment with the crystal structure of ubiquitin ( PDB - 1UBQ ) reveals a number of similarities and differences with the SPN domain ( figure 16 ) . Although divergent in sequence , the UBL fold is remarkably structurally conserved ( Kiel et al . , 2005 ) shown by the backbone RMSD value of 1 . 6Å between the SPN domain and ubiquitin . The similarity is more remarkable when we consider the SPN domain is 18 residues larger than ubiquitin . This increase in length is reflected in the linkers between the β4 and β5 strands that are larger in the SPN domain ( figure 16 ) , and the linker between the β3 and β4 strands . The β2 strand in the SPN domain is reduced in length at the N - terminus and this may have some functional relevance in intermolecular interaction . The ubiquitin family shares a number of functional features that facilitate linkage and the hydrophobic packing of adjacent ubiquitin molecules for degradation signalling ( Komander and Rape 2012 ) . Ubiquitin substrate recognition is mediated by mainly two conserved epitopes the Ile36 and Ile44 patches ( Komander and Rape 2012 ) . These regions are highlighted on figure 17 , and within the SPN domain these regions are not conserved . Comparison of the SPN domain with the established Rap1 effector C - Raf1 ( Nassar et al . , 1995 ) shows that the SPN domain contains the functional epitope that confers Ras / Rap1 binding specificity ( Kiel et al . , 2005 ) . This epitope corresponds to residues R12 , K22 and R25 on the SPN domain . These share structural homology with R39 , 47 and 73 on the surface of C - Raf1 . Classically , Ras Association ( RA ) / Ras binding domains ( RBD ) share positively charged interfaces that are complementary to the negatively charged β - strand regions of GTPases ( Nassar et al . , 1997 ; Kiel et al . , 2005 ) . Complementary charges on the β1β2 strands stabilise an intermolecular β - sheet between the adjacent proteins . The Phyre2 ( Kelley et al . , 2007 ) online server identified the talin F0 sub - domain as the closest structural homologue of the SPN domain . Goult et al ( 2010 ) showed that the F0 domain of talin has a K d = 150 μM for Rap1A ; figure 18 shows the RA domain epitope of talin F0 . The surface charge distribution of F0 is more negatively charged than the SPN . However there are two lysines ( K7 , K15 ) that may contribute to the affinity ( these occupy analogous positions of R12 and K22 on SPN ) . Given this charge distribution , and the fact that the SPN charge distribution has higher similarity to C - Raf1 than F0 , one would expect the K d of a Rap1A - SPN domain interaction to be greater than a Rap1A - F0 interaction . 159 | P a g e Figure 16 Figure 16 – Structural comparison of the SPN domain ( blend of colours ) with Ubiquitin ( Cyan ( 1UBQ ) ) with structural differences highlighted and shown in boxes .

As Rap1A has regulatory functions at the PSD ( Spilker et al . , 2008 ; Caron et al . , 2002 ) it may provide a functionally significant candidate for interactions with SHANK3 . Rap1A was expressed in C6K600 cells and purified using anion affinity chromatography in the presence of 3mM MgCl 2 ( as previously described by Van den Berghe 1997 ) . Protein was then subsequently purified by gel filtration using a Superdex 75 26 / 60 column in 20mM Tris pH 7 . 4 , 150mM NaCl , 3mM DTT , 5mM MgCl 2 . Purification was performed in the presence of Mg 2 + to prevent conversion to apo form ; the yield was 5mg / litre in 2YT culture . GTPase samples are required to be homogonous and saturated in active ( GTP or GMPnP ) form or inactive ( GDP ) . GMPnP is preferred as it is a non - hydrolysable analogue of GTP , inducing the same conformational change but with no hydrolysis to GDP . To perform the nucleotide exchange from the mixed ( GDP and GTP bound ) state post purification ( verified by 1D proton spectrum ) , Rap1A was exchanged into 20mM MES pH 6 . 5 , 50mM NaCl , 2mM DTT . From this stock the buffer was made 5mM EDTA from a 0 . 5M EDTA ( Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ) stock . GMPnP ( or GDP ) was then added in a 20 molar excess of the protein concentration in solution determined by Bradford assay . After this , the buffer was exchanged back into 20mM Tris pH 7 . 4 , 150mM NaCl , 3mM DTT containing no magnesium , this will remove EDTA chelated Mg 2 + from the protein . After this the buffer was made 3mM MgCl 2 to maintain the integrity of the holo - form of the protein . 1 H proton spectrum was used to confirm the state of the enzyme . Figure 19 shows the characteristic methyl resonance shifts of the GDP and GMPnP form , the success of the GTP exchange can be judged by comparison of the spectra shown in Figure 19 . 163 | P a g e Figure 19 Figure 19 shows a comparison of NMR spectra of Rap1 in GDP and GMPnP form . The spectra of the forms are distinctly different allowing to monitor the effectiveness of the exchange process . Small signals corresponding to the GDP form can be identified in the spectrum of GMPnP - Rap1 with the intensity of ~ 5 % of the dominant signals of the GTP form ( Fig 19 ) . This corresponds to the GDP / GMPnP ratio in the exchange mixture . This exchange level is sufficient for the binding experiments . If higher exchange level is required the exchange procedure can be repeated or larger access of GMPnP used .

Spectra were collected at 298k and at field strength of 600MHz . GMPnP 164 | P a g e 5 . 4 . 2 . 2 - Rap1A and SHANK3 form a high affinity complex To establish the binding between Rap1A and SHANK3 , analytical gel filtration was used . Rap1A elutes as a globular 19kDa protein on gel filtration , SHANK3 elutes as a globular 38kDa protein . When mixed in the same sample the two proteins co - elute . The elution volume of this peak is consistent with a 60kDa complex in comparison with calibration proteins . The Bradford assay used for determination of Rap1A concentration is inaccurate ( as Bradford reactivity is protein dependent ) , thus ITC was used to calibrate the Rap1A concentration based on estimates from the Bradford assay . The inaccuracy of the Bradford assay is reflected in figure 20B where there is an excess of Rap1A - GMPnP in the presence of the complex even though both proteins were apparently loaded at 1 : 1 . Note this could also be a small population of protein where GDP exchange is incomplete . ITC calibration was used assuming a 1 : 1 stoichiometry where K d can be estimated . The concentration of SHANK3 can be accurately determined due to the high extinction co - efficient of 27390 M - 1 cm - 1 . Therefore the stoichiometry is estimated at 0 . 95±0 . 05 sites is consistent with other Ras effector stoichiometries ( Kiel et al . , 2005 ) , but this requires supporting evidence from SEC - MALLS .

This binding is exceptionally strong for a Ras effector interaction and well within the range of physiologically relevant interactions . Interestingly , comparison with Ral - GDS reveals thermodynamic similarities in their interactions . Both require large enthalpic contributions for high affinity engagement to compensate for unfavourable entropies ( for a more extensive catalogue of Ras effector thermodynamics , Wohlgemuth et al . , and ( 2005 ) is recommended ) .

The RA domain is anchored to the ankyrin domain with mid - range electrostatic contacts decorated across the surface of the ankyrin domain . This work has identified a previously unidentified domain with implications for synaptic recruitment and focal adhesion regulation . Studies of ASD patients and pull down assays have shown that L68P is a de novo mutation that reveals a SHARPIN binding site ( Mameza et al . , 2013 ; Gauthier et al . , 2009 ) . Mameza et al ( 2013 ) demonstrated using co - immunocprecipitation experiments , that introduction of the L68P mutation increases relative levels of SHARPIN binding to SHANK 1 - 348 . Combined with our new knowledge that the N - terminal contains a RA ( Ras association ) domain , this suggests that destabilisation of the SPN domain results in increased availability of the ankyrin repeat , substantiating the hypothesis of an autoinhibitory complex . The SHANK3 SPN domain binds to Rap1A with high affinity , second only to Ral - GDS in known binding affinities ( Kiel et al . , 2005 ) . Durand et al ( 2012 ) showed that introduction of an R12C mutation within the SPN domain results in deficient dendritic morphology . As shown in figure 21 , this residue is part of the RA domain epitope that is critical for GTPase association . Our data explains this observation and critically identifies Rap1A as potential GTPase in synaptic recruitment . Figure 21 Figure 21 - Ribbon representation of the SPN domain with the RA domain epitope highlighted with red surface . Ras effectors are characteristically positively charged and key residues are listed ( Kiel et al . , 2005 ) . 167 | P a g e Associations with GTPases are sometimes promiscuous due to high sequence similarity and structural homology . Therefore a pertinent question still unanswered is whether Ras binds SHANK3 ; the answer will begin to elucidate the intracellular function of this SPN domain . Rap1A is mainly associated with adhesive processes ( Caron et al . , 2003 ; Shimonaka et al . , 2003 ; Wendholt et al . , 2006 ) , whereas Ras is associated predominantly with cell proliferation ( Drosten et al . , 2010 ) . Irrespective of specificity , Ras / Rap GTPases contain a C - terminal region associated with isoprenylation and this is responsible for membrane recruitment . Rap1A is membrane associated at the leading edge and this raises the possibility of SHANK3 potentially forming part of an integrin regulation pathway . Figure 22 Rantala et al ( 2011 ) shows that SHARPIN competes with talin and kindlins and negatively attenuates integrin activation by inside - out signalling . Therefore Rap1A binding may recruit a SHANK3 - SHARPIN complex to the membrane in a parallel pathway to talin recruitment . This raises the possibility that Rap1A and SHARPIN may form a ternary complex with SHANK ; this hypothesis requires examination in further work . Figure 22 - Proposed mechanism of SHANK3 based integrin regulation . Rap1A recruits SHANK3 to the cell membrane , recruiting SHARPIN in proximity to α - integrin tails . SHANK3 is shown in red . The talin FERM domain is shown in spectrum colours , as is Rap1A . 168 | P a g e 6 - Discussion 169 | P a g e 6 - Discussion In cell migration a multitude of binding events leads to the formation and maturation of cell - matrix adhesions . The GTPase Rap1A induces adhesion formation ( Shimonaka et al . , 2003 ) , and this thesis has highlighted the multiple functions of Rap1A in adhesion regulation . In this thesis I have shown how talin synergistically binds to the Rap1 adaptor RIAM , and this thesis provides a model of force - induced RIAM displacement , in favour of talin - vinculin complexes . This thesis solves the structure of the SHANK3 N - terminus , demonstrating the existence of an unrecognised Ras - association domain . If SHANK3 - Rap1A binding is specific , Rap1A could also recruit SHARPIN to the nascent adhesion and provide a competitive integrin inactivation pathway , linking SHARPIN and integrin ( Rantala et al . , 2011 ) . This could establish a new mode of adhesion regulation . DLC1 is recruited to mature focal adhesions through a central LD - like motif ( Li et al . , 2011 ) . Here we show the structural basis of this interaction and suggest mutations to disrupt complex in vivo . This is the first structure of talin in a complex , and the topology of the complex is similar to talin 5 - helix bundles . This thesis has two larger structural themes that are of pertinent interest and require further discussion . In chapter 3 we saw how RIAM engages the talin R3 sub - domain and we mapped this site to the α2 - α3 face of R3 . In chapter 4 we observed the formation of an R7R8 - DLC1 complex . As the mechanisms of RIAM and DLC1 - talin interactions are related then they may represent a general scheme of how talin binds to amphipathic ligands . 170 | P a g e 6 . 1 - 4 - helix bundle interactions In both R3 and R8 , ligand binding is isolated to the α2 - α3 face of the helical bundle . As this binding site appears to be structurally conserved , both sites may share similarities of charge distribution . Figure 1 examines the surface charge distribution of α2 - α3 faces on both bundles R3 and R8 . This analysis shows that R3 contains a hydrophobic groove that shares similar properties to the DLC1 binding site in R8 . Consistent with chemical shift mapping in chapter 3 , this suggests both RIAM and DLC1 bind to their cognate helical bundles via a similar mechanism of helix addition . Figure 1 The data in this thesis suggests that the focal adhesion is an interchange of helical proteins that regulate the binding of intracellular ligands . In addition to R2R3 , RIAM engages R8 and R11 representing a form of degeneracy . This could be functionally significant , and may suggest inactivation of the N - terminal RIAM binding sites in talin could be compensated for by C - terminal domains . The full extent and mechanism of RIAM interactions are yet to be elucidated and require further structural characterisation . Figure 1 - Surface charge distribution across the ligand binding faces of R3 and R8 . Blue represents positive charges and red represents negative charges and non - charged in white . The arrow shown represents the potential location of either RIAM or DLC1 . Talin representation based on existing solution structures ; RIAM binding sites are shown in blue . RIAM binding sites 171 | P a g e The data presented here have shown that RIAM and DLC1 amphipathic helices engage two of the 4 - helix bundles of talin ; this raises the possibility that the other talin 4 - helix bundles may engage helical ligands in a similar way . To examine this hypothesis the surface charges of the 4 - helix bundles are examined in figure 2 , with the exception of R1R2 . R1R2 is a 5 + 4 - helix bundle , thus the double - domain interface is restricted in terms of potential interactions . If we extrapolate potential interactions based on the presence of an uncharged hydrophobic patch we can predict potential 4 - helix bundle interaction . On R3 there are two sites ( figure 2 ) , site 1 ( the RIAM binding site ) and potentially site 4 that contains this hydrophobic surface , on R8 there is the DLC1 binding site ( site 2 ) . R2 contains only 1 potential site , whereas R4 contains sites 1 and 4 . The other faces of the bundles have a large distribution of positive and negative charges and this makes the engagement of an amphipathic helix unlikely . This , of course , does not rule out intermolecular interaction based on electrostatic contacts . An interesting recourse to this analysis is raised by the data from Goult et al ( 2013 ) , who screened all the rod domains for RIAM interactions . In R4 there were no interactions detected with RIAM . Thus it remains of pertinent interest if there are any specific interactions exhibited by these domains and their preferred ligands . 172 | P a g e Figure 2 Figure 2 – Surface charge distribution of talin 4 - helix bundle R3 , R4 , R8 and the 5 + 4 - helix bundle R1R2 . Orientation of panel 1 is the same as adjacent ribbon diagram . Each panel represents a 90 o rotation from the preceding diagram . On the surface charge distribution blue represents positive charge , red negative charges and non - charged in white . 173 | P a g e 6 . 2 - 5 - helix bundle interactions TBS1 also binds to R11 ( Goult et al . , 2013 ) and R11 is a 5 - helix bundle , thus structurally this is slightly puzzling and suggests formation of a 6 - helix bundle . If we propose the hypothesis that like 4 - helix bundles the binding is dependent on the availability of a hydrophobic patch , then closer examination is required of the talin 5 - helix bundles , as potentially other amphipathic ligands could engage them . Surface charge analysis of all of the talin 5 - helix bundles identifies multiple hydrophobic sites that could potentially engage hydrophobic ligands . In figure 3 then we can see the 5 - helix bundles with potential sites highlighted . The bundle R11 contains one site of potential interaction highlighted . Structural alignment and comparison with a pseudo - 6 - helix ( exemplified by the FAK - FAT domain in complex with paxillin LD’s 2 and 4 , PDB - 2L6F ( figure 3 ) ) bundle reveals the potential orientation of RIAM with respect to R11 . Structural alignment using CCP4mg reveals that the hydrophobic site visible on figure 3 has an analogous binding site on FAK , and this may be the site of engagement of RIAM . The use of the structure 2L6F , however is rather limiting as an example . This NMR structure is a chimera and thus not a naturally occurring topology . However it does display a potential arrangement that R11 may adopt in a complex . There are relatively few examples to date on the PDB of naturally occurring 6 helix bundles . 174 | P a g e Figure 3 – Surface charge distribution of talin 5 - helix bundles R5 , R6 , R7 , R9 , R10 , R11 , R12 and R13 .

Structural super - imposition with the crystal structure of R11 ( PDB - 3DYJ ) shows that RIAM could occupy the α2 - a3 or α1 - α4 face of R11 . 176 | P a g e 6 . 3 - SHANK and focal adhesions During this thesis we have shown that SHANK3 contains an N - terminal Ras - association ( RA ) domain . Mutations within this domain are responsible for deficient membrane recruitment ( Durand et al . , 2012 ) . Our data show a direct high affinity interaction with Rap1A that may be responsible for SHANK3 - PSD recruitment . This data highlights a potential role in focal adhesion regulation , through potential Rap1A dependent membrane recruitment to the nascent adhesion . 6 . 3 . 1 - The Rap1A - SHANK3 connection Rap1A has a wide variety of signalling roles some of contrast to its structural homologue Ras ( Caron et al . , 2003 ) . Rap1A is activated downstream of RapGEFs ( Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factor ) , and the GEFS are specific to cell surface receptors and physiological context . Figure 5 shows the diversity of extracellular triggers to Rap1A signalling , thus the specific role of SHANK3 - Rap1 binding may be downstream of multiple potential pathways . Figure 5 Figure 5 – Cell surface receptors and GTPases coupled to the activation of Rap1 - GEF , and an increase in the cellular levels of Rap1A - GTP , PDGF ( Platelet - Derived Growth Factor ) , TNFa ( Tumor Necrosis Factor α ) , NMDA ( N - methyl - D - aspartate ) receptors ( Diagram based on Caron et al . , 2003 ) . 177 | P a g e A pertinent direction of the future work will be the elucidation of potential biological role of the binding to Ras . Ras interactions are traditionally associated with cellular proliferation ( Drosten et al . , 2010 ) . Thus if the RA domain is promiscuous there may be two potential intracellular roles . Either SHANK3 may be recruited as a downstream effector of EGF ( Epidermal Growth Factor ) related pathways , or recruited to the leading edge , and inhibit the formation of nascent adhesions regulating SHARPIN - integrin binding . 6 . 3 . 2 - SHARPIN regulation in NF - κB SHARPIN also has a pivotal role in the regulation of NF - κB signalling . Mutations in SHARPIN are pathological in mice , and induce immune system disorders ( Ikeda et al . , 2011 ; Grabbe et al . , 2009 ) . SHARPIN forms part of the LUBAC ( Linear Ubiquitin Chain Assembly Complex ) with proteins HOIP ( HOIL - 1 - interacting protein ) and HOIL - 1 ( Heme - oxidised IRP2 ligase 1 ) . Together these proteins mediate ubiquitination of the NF - κB regulatory protein NEMO ( NF - κB essential modulator ) . NEMO forms part of the canonical NF - κB IKK ( IκB kinase ) complex , ubiquitination of NEMO induces the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of the IκB regulatory sub - unit of the NF - κB complex ( consisting of p50 , p65 and IκB ) . NEMO is in proximity to the cytosolic region of the TNFα ( Tumour necrosis factor ) receptor upon linear ubiquitination ( Tokunaga et al . , 2013 ) . Lim et al ( 2001 ) shows that the central UBL fold of SHARPIN engages the ankyrin domain ; thus SHANK3 could sequester SHARPIN at the cell membrane ( in a GTPase dependent manner ) providing localisation for eventual ubiquitination function . 6 . 3 . 3 - The multiple roles of Rap1A Rap1A is activated in response to intracellular cAMP increases via the GEF - EPAC ( Exchange Protein Activated by cAMP ) ( Tsygankova et al . , 2001 ) . Rap1A is largely membrane associated , but can be localised to the mid - golgi and late endocytic vesicles ( Beranger et al . , 1991 ; Pizon et al . , 1994 ) . This may partially explain its susceptibility to the second messenger cAMP . Rap1A is predominantly associated with adhesive functions and T - cell receptor signalling , thus strongly linking SHANK3 with a potential role in adhesion regulation . Activity at the postsynaptic density is negatively attenuated by the neuronal RapGAP - Spa1 ; this raises the possibility of a direct neuronal signalling axis though Rap1A , and a potential role in the pathogenesis of autism - spectrum disorders through Ras / Rap ( Spilker et al . , 2008 ) . If a high affinity SHANK3 - Ras interaction is confirmed ; this would provide a direct path to cellular proliferation and potentially the accelerated brain growth associated with autism - spectrum disorders . 178 | P a g e The most prominent role of Rap1A in recent years has been its role in focal adhesion regulation . The work in this thesis confirms that its effector ( RIAM ) does indeed recruit talin as previously demonstrated in vivo . Though given RIAM recruitment is more dependent on lipid composition of the cell membrane ( PIP2 ) than its RA domain ( Wynne et al . , 2012 ) . It may be the case that the RIAM RA domain could be out - competed by higher affinity Rap1A partners at the nascent adhesion ( namely SHANK3 ) . This further highlights the function of the second messenger PIP2 in regulating the spacial distribution and activity of RIAM , as well as being responsible for talin regulation ( Wynne et al . , 2012 ; Martel et al . , 2001 ) . 6 . 4 - Conclusion and perspectives The focal adhesion is one of the most important and dynamic systems posing challenges to molecular biology and biophysics . This thesis has biochemically - characterised interactions between talin - RIAM and vinculin . The integrin activation question has been central to focal adhesion research for the past decade and now initiation and maturation is better understood some , of the more challenging question remaining0are0associated0with0disassembly . This work has dealt with the interplay and regulation of the focal adhesion initiation complex and answered the questions this work sought to answer when set upon . One of the highlights of this thesis has been the elucidation of the crystal structure of the SHANK3 N - terminal domain and recognising it as a true Ras - effector , with far reaching implications for focal adhesion and postsynaptic density protein regulation . This work has used structural biology techniques to characterise intermolecular interactions on the atomic level . No other techniques provide the detailed information on protein - protein interactions . Recent advances in bioinformatics based on deposited structures provide a powerful tool for prediction . However these cannot replace the requirement for structural characterisation , and only through structural characterisation can novelty be recognised . 179 | P a g e References Abercrombie , M . , Heaysman , J .
