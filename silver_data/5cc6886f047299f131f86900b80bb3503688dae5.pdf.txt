The natural in ﬂ ammatory response is a major regulator of vascularization , through the activity of different types of macrophages and the cytokines they secrete . Macrophages exist on a spectrum of diverse phenotypes , from “ classically activated ” M1 to “ alternatively activated ” M2 macrophages . M2 macrophages , including the subsets M2a and M2c , are typically considered to promote angiogenesis and tissue regeneration , while M1 macro - phages are considered to be anti - angiogenic , although these classi ﬁ cations are controversial . Here we show that in contrast to this traditional paradigm , primary human M1 macrophages secrete the highest levels of potent angiogenic stimulators including VEGF ; M2a macrophages secrete the highest levels of PDGF - BB , a chemoattractant for stabilizing pericytes , and also promote anastomosis of sprouting endothelial cells in vitro ; and M2c macrophages secrete the highest levels of MMP9 , an important protease involved in vascular remodeling . In a murine subcutaneous implantation model , porous collagen scaffolds were surrounded by a ﬁ brous capsule , coincident with high expression of M2 macrophage markers , while scaffolds coated with the bacterial lipopolysaccharide were degraded by in ﬂ ammatory macrophages , and glutaraldehyde - crosslinked scaffolds were in ﬁ ltrated by substantial numbers of blood vessels , accompanied by high levels of M1 and M2 macrophages . These results suggest that coordinated efforts by both M1 and M2 macrophages are required for angiogenesis and scaffold vascularization , which may explain some of the controversy over which phenotype is the angiogenic phenotype .

Early research focused largely on the chemical and mechanical proper - ties of biomaterial scaffolds and considered the immune response a factor that needed to be minimized . Only recently , a notion is emerging that the in ﬂ ammatory response can play a major role in integration and vascularization of biomaterial scaffolds [ 1 ] . Manipulation of the immune response could thus be bene ﬁ cial to the design of future therapies . The goal of this study was to understand the speci ﬁ c role that the macrophage , the cell at the center of the in ﬂ ammatory response , plays in vascularization of tissue engineering scaffolds . Macrophages , originally believed to be solely pro - in ﬂ ammatory and destructive phagocytes , were found in 1992 to have ability to convert to a pro - healing phenotype [ 2 ] . Since then , it has been shown that macrophages are necessary for angiogenesis , wound healing , tumor growth , and even limb regeneration in the sala - mander [ 3 e 6 ] . To distinguish this new phenotype from their familiar “ classically activated ” counterparts , these macrophages were referred to as “ alternatively activated ” . Since then , these “ M2 ” macrophages , named following the helper T cell nomenclature ( Th1 / Th2 ) and in contrast to pro - in ﬂ ammatory “ M1 ” macrophages , have been associated with the resolution of wound healing in vivo in chronic leg ulcers [ 7 ] , atherosclerotic lesions [ 8 ] , traumatic spinal cord injury [ 9 ] , and in ﬂ ammatory renal disease [ 10 , 11 ] .

Biomaterials 35 ( 2014 ) 4477 e 4488 tumor - associated macrophages , widely believed to belong to the class of M2 macrophages , in promoting angiogenesis is well - established [ 12 ] . However , the role of non - tumor - associated M2 macrophages in angiogenesis is poorly understood . While some studies showed that decreased ratios of the numbers of M1 / M2 macrophages correlate with biomaterial vascularization [ 13 e 17 ] , other studies showed that increased M1 / M2 ratios correlate with more vascularization [ 18 e 20 ] . Also , the perceived anti - angiogenic behavior of M1 macrophages contradicts the fact that in ﬂ amma - tory diseases such as macular degeneration , psoriasis , atheroscle - rosis , diabetic retinopathy , Crohn ’ s disease , rheumatoid arthritis , and intervertebral disc degeneration are all characterized by excessive angiogenesis [ 21 e 26 ] . Understanding alternative activation of macrophages is further complicated by different subgroups within that classi ﬁ cation . M2 macrophages were originally described as those stimulated with interleukin - 4 ( IL4 ) , but the M2 designation was quickly expanded to include macrophages with very different characteristics [ 27 ] . The traditional M2 macrophages were called M2a , and macrophages stimulated with IL10 were called M2c . The difference between M2a and M2c macrophages , especially in the context of angiogenesis , remains unclear . Although it has been established that M1 mac - rophages appear at early stages of wound healing ( 1 e 3 days ) and are later replaced with M2 macrophages ( 4 e 7 days ) [ 28 , 29 ] , there is no clear distinction between M2a and M2c macrophages in this process . Our objective was to better understand the distinctive roles of the M1 and M2 macrophage subtypes in angiogenesis and vascu - larization of biomaterials , and to devise strategies for designing scaffolds that can effectively induce and mediate vasculogenesis . To this end , we analyzed gene expression and protein secretion pro - ﬁ les in M0 , M1 , M2a , and M2c macrophages for angiogenesis invitro , and then investigated the in vivo vascularization of scaffolds selected to elicit speci ﬁ c macrophage responses . 2 . Materials and methods 2 . 1 . Monocyte isolation and preparation of polarized macrophages and conditioned media Monocytes were isolated from buffy coats ( obtained from the New York Blood Center ) using sequential density gradient centrifugations of Ficoll and Percoll 46 % [ 30 ] . The yield of CD14 þ monocytes , assessed by ﬂ ow cytometry , was typically around 70 % . The monocytes were cultured in ultra low attachment ﬂ asks in RPMI 1640 medium with 10 % heat - inactivated human serum and 20 ng / mL monocyte colony stimulating factor ( MCSF ) to differentiate them into macrophages . Tissue culture polystyrene has been shown to promote activation of monocytes and mac - rophages compared to Te ﬂ on - coated surfaces [ 31 ] , and we found in preliminary studies that ultra low attachment plastic produced similar yet more consistent re - sults compared to Te ﬂ on . The media was changed at day 3 , and by day 5 , the mac - rophages were attached to the plastic . Polarization was begun by changing to fresh media supplemented with 20 ng / mL MCSF and the following cytokines : 100 ng / mL interferon - gamma ( IFN g ) and 100 ng / mL lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) for M1 ; 40 ng / mL IL4and20ng / mLIL13forM2a ; and40ng / mLIL10forM2c . After48hofpolarization , macrophages were collected by gentle scraping . A small sample was taken for gene expression analysis , and the rest of the cells were incubated in fresh medium at 10 6 cells / mLwithnocytokinesfor24h . Macrophageswerecollectedbyscrapingand analyzed by ﬂ ow cytometry , and the conditioned media was centrifuged at 400 (cid:2) g for 10 min and frozen at (cid:3) 80 (cid:4) C until analysis or use for culture of endothelial cells . 2 . 2 . LPS contamination Medium was tested for LPS contamination using the Pierce LAL Chromogenic Endotoxin Quanti ﬁ cation kit according to the manufacture ’ s instructions . LPS contamination was always < 0 . 2 EU / mL . 2 . 3 . Flow cytometric analysis Theexpressionofsurfaceantigenswasevaluatedbyincubating125 , 000M0 , M1 , M2a or M2c macrophages at 4 (cid:4) C for 1 h with the respective antibodies in 100 m L FACS buffer ( 1 m M EDTA in PBS with 0 . 5 % BSA ) ( Sigma ) . The molecules evaluated were the antigen - presenting molecule HLA - DR , chemokine receptor CCR7 , scav - enger receptor CD163 and the mannose receptor CD206 . The following antibodies were used for evaluation : FITC - conjugated mouse antibodies against CD206 ( Biolegend . com , catalog no . 321103 , dilution 1 : 100 ) , APC - conjugated mouse anti - bodies against CD163 ( Abcam , catalog no . ab134416 , dilution 1 : 50 ) and CCR7 ( Biolegend . com , catalog no . 353213 , dilution 1 : 50 ) , and PE - conjugated mouse an - tibodies against HLA - DR ( Abcam , catalog no . ab113839 , dilution 1 : 100 ) . Corre - sponding isotype controls were used as recommended by the manufacturers for comparison with each antibody . Labeled cells were washed twice in 1 mL FACS bufferand ﬁ xedusingCyto ﬁ x ( BDPharminogen ) . Thesampleswereanalyzedusinga FACSCalibur ﬂ ow cytometer and the CellQuest software ( BD Biosciences , Pharmi - nogen ) . Data was processed using FlowJo ( Tree Star ) and the percentage population of each cell type that stained positively for the respective markers was compared by gating at 1 % inclusion of isotype controls to eliminate non - speci ﬁ c staining . 2 . 4 . RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis RNAqueous (cid:3) - Micro kit ( Life Technologies ) for RNA extraction was used ac - cording tothemanufacturer ’ sinstructions , elutingthesamples atthe ﬁ nal stepwith 5 m L of elution solutions three times . The quantity of RNA was measured on a NanodropND1000andconsideredpureif theratioofabsorbanceat260nm / 280nm was (cid:5) 2 . Thesampleswerethenstoredat (cid:3) 80 (cid:4) Cuntilusedforreversetranscription . The RNA was ﬁ rst treated with DNase I removal kit ( Invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions . cDNA synthesis was preformed using High Capacity kit fromAppliedBiosystemsaccordingtothemanufacturer ’ sinstructions . Eachreaction tube contained (cid:6) 1000 ng RNA . 2 . 5 . Quantitative analysis of gene expression using RT - PCR Quantitative RT - PCR analysis was performed using 20 ng cDNA per reaction and the SYBR (cid:3) Green PCR Master Mix ( Applied Biosystems by Life Technologies ) . The expression of target genes was normalized to the housekeeping gene GAPDH , and then to the unactivated M0 phenotype ( 2 (cid:3) DD Ct ) . Gene expression values were calculated by using the mean C T values of the samples . All primers ( Table S1 ) were synthesized by Life Technologies . 2 . 6 . Secreted protein quanti ﬁ cation using ELISA HumanVEGFandPDGF - BBMiniELISADevelopmentKits ( Peprotech ) andMMP9 Quantikine ELISA kits ( R & D Systems ) were used according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions . 2 . 7 . Gel zymography Conditioned media was assessed for enzymatically active MMP9 content using gel zymography ( Novex Zymogram gels , Life Technologies ) . 5 m L of conditioned medium was loaded into the 10 % Zymogram ( gelatin ) gel and run for 90 min at 120 V . The gel was developed overnight and stained with SimplyBlue . 2 . 8 . Endothelial cell isolation and culture Human umbilical cord derived endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) were isolated from fresh umbilical veins from the neonatal unit at Columbia University following an approved IRB protocol ( IRBAAAC4839 ) according to previously described methods [ 32 ] . HUVECs were cultured in endothelial growth media ( EGM - 2 , Lonza ) and cells from passages 2 e 4 were used in experiments . 2 . 9 . In vitro sprout formation analysis Transparent hanging transwell inserts ( Millipore , 0 . 4 m m pore size ) were coated in 40 m L of a 1 : 1 solution of Matrigel (cid:3) and endothelial basal media ( EBM2 ) and incubated for 1 h at 37 (cid:4) C . Each insert was placed in a 24 - well plate containing 400 m L of macrophage - conditioned media with an additional 100 m L added directly into each insert ( n ¼ 3 e 5 replicates per phenotype per donor , n ¼ 3 donors ) . RPMI media with 10 % heat - inactivated human serum and EGM2 were used as negative and positive controls , respectively . 20 , 000 HUVECs were added to each insert and were cultured at 37 (cid:4) C for 18 h . The cells were then stained with a Live / Dead (cid:3) kit ( Invitrogen ) following the manufacturer ’ s instructions and the networks were imaged with the 10 (cid:2) objective of an Olympus IX81 microscope . Calcein - AM was used to indicate live cells , and ethidium homodimer - 1 was used to indicate dead cells . Twoor threeimagesof each samplewere requiredtocapture all sproutsin the samples . Background was removed and the networks were analyzed as described in Fig . S1 . Brie ﬂ y , the images were stitched together using the pairwise and grid / collection stitching toolbox in FIJI [ 33 ] resulting in one image per sample . The fused images were converted into 8 - bit TIFF ﬁ les and adjusted for brightness / contrast to distinguish the networks against the background . A custom - designed algorithm in MATLAB was utilized to remove any noise ( i . e . structures not part of the network ) . Functions fromtheImageProcessingToolboxinMATLABwereemployedtoperform the image manipulation . A map of the background was generated and subtracted from the image , resulting in an image with a completely dark ﬁ eld that was con - verted intoasetofbinary imageswith varyinggray thresholdvalues . Morphological cleaning , bridging , and closing operations were performed on images to smooth the edges of the network and maintain connectivity over ﬁ ne structural elements . The resulting set of images contained the network elements at varying threshold values , K . L . Spiller et al . / Biomaterials 35 ( 2014 ) 4477 e 4488 4478 allowingfor the creationof a single binary imagewith each element incorporated at an optimal gray threshold . An element - by - element multiplication was performed between this binary image and the original microscope image to yield a ﬁ nal clean image for network analysis . For each sample , the total area of the networks was calculated in MATLAB and the number of sprouts and nodes was determined using the Angiogenesis Analyzer macro in ImageJ [ 34 ] . To determine the number of sprouts , the Analyzer was set to resolvethe numberof segments , isolated segments , and branched segments . To determine the number of nodes , the Analyzer was set to locate each junction point . 2 . 10 . Viability and metabolic assays HUVECs were starved overnight in EBM2 with 0 . 5 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) prior to seeding at a density of 5000 cells per well in 100 m L conditioned media in a 96 - wellplate ( n ¼ 9pergroup ) . EGM - 2wasusedasapositivecontrolandRPMIwith 0 . 5 % FBS was used as a negative control . After 18 h , the wells were washed with PBS and DNA content was quanti ﬁ ed using Quant - iT (cid:4) PicoGreen (cid:3) dsDNA Assay kit ( Invitrogen ) according tothe manufacturer ’ s instructions . DNAwas quanti ﬁ ed using a standard curve prepared using l - phage DNA . Metabolic activity of the cells during the viability study was measured using Alamar Blue (cid:3) reagent according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions ( Life Technologies ) . 2 . 11 . In vitro ﬁ brin assay Fibrinogen ( 4 mg / ml ) was mixed in equal parts with thrombin ( 0 . 2 U / mL ) , and 100 m L was added to each well of an 8 - well chamberslide ( Thermo Scienti ﬁ c Nunc Labtek ) . Gelationwas allowed to occur for 1 h at 37 (cid:4) C , and then 8000 HUVECs were added to each well in 200 m L EGM - 2 overnight . Media was changed to 300 m L conditioned media from M0 , M1 , M2a , or M2c phenotypes , or a 33 / 33 / 33 combi - nation of M1 , M2a , and M2c phenotypes . Basal media ( RPMI with 10 % heat - inactivated human serum ) was used as a control . After 24 h in macrophage - conditioned media , the media was changed again to either media conditioned by the same phenotype of macrophages , or different macrophages , in order to evaluate sequential application of different signals . After 3 days ( 4 total days of culture in macrophage - conditioned media ) , the samples were washed and ﬁ xed with 4 % paraformaldehyde directly in the chamberslides . The samples were stained with DAPI to visualize cell nuclei and Alexa ﬂ uor - 488 Phalloidin ( Life Technologies ) to visualize actin ﬁ laments , and imaged using an Olympus Fluoview FV1000 Confocal microscope . 2 . 12 . Scaffold preparation and subcutaneous implantation Cylindrical disks ( 7 mm in diameter (cid:2) 2 . 5 mm thick ) were punched from sheets of collagen sponge ( Avitene (cid:4) Ultrafoam (cid:4) ) . Scaffolds were either soaked in PBS ( “ Collagen ” ) , 0 . 1 % glutaraldehyde in PBS ( “ Glutaraldehyde - crosslinked ” ) , or 100 ng / mLLPS ( “ LPS - coated ” ) for4h . Then , scaffoldswerewashed4timesfor10mininPBS , and incubated in RPMI medium for 4 days . Glutaraldehyde - crosslinked scaffolds were incubated for 4 h in 0 . 1 M glycine to quench any residual glutaraldehyde and then in RPMI medium overnight . Allanimalexperimentsfollowedfederalguidelines andwereconductedundera protocol approved by the Columbia University Animal Care and Use Committee . Scaffolds from the above three groups were implanted subcutaneously in male 8 - week - old C57BL / 6 mice for 10 days ( one sample per mouse , n ¼ 3 mice per group ) . In addition , to eliminate the effects of animal - to - animal differences , one scaffold of the unmodi ﬁ ed collagen and one glutaraldehyde - crosslinked scaffolds were implanted into three mice ( n ¼ 6 ) . Mice were anesthetized using 100 mg / kg ketamine and 10 mg / kg xylazine and shaved . A small incision ( < 1 cm ) was made using a scalpel in the central dorsal surface . Blunt forceps were used to create a pocketinthesubcutaneousspaceforthescaffolds . Afterimplantation , woundswere closed with two sutures . Mice were monitored and housed for 10 days . No signs of discomfort were observed following surgery throughout the study . 2 . 13 . Explant and histological analysis After10 days , mice were euthanized by CO 2 asphyxiation . An incisionwas made and the skin was pulled back to expose the scaffolds . Gross view images were taken immediately with an Olympus SZX16 stereomicroscope . The scaffolds and sur - rounding tissue were excised and ﬁ xed in 4 % paraformaldehyde overnight . The samples werewashed for 6 h in PBS , incubated in 30 % sucrose for 3 days , embedded in OCT ( Tissue - Tek , Torrance , TA ) and frozen . Samples were sectioned to 5 m m and mounted onto slides for histological evaluation . Tissue structure was examined by staining with hematoxylin and eosin ( H & E ) , which stains nuclei dark blue to black , and cytoplasm and collagen pink . Images of whole tissue sections were obtained using the stitching function of an Olympus FX100 microscope and software . 2 . 14 . Immuno ﬂ uorescence Sections were analyzed for three markers of the M1 phenotype ( TNF - alpha , iNOS , and CCR7 ) and three markers of the M2 phenotype ( CD206 , Arg1 , and CD163 ) , along with the pan - macrophage marker F480 , using the antibodies and dilutions described in Ref . [ 16 ] and CD163 ( 1 : 50 ) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology . Endothelial cells were stained with rabbit - anti - mouse CD31 ( 1 : 50 ) from Abcam . 2 . 15 . Statistical analysis Data are shown as mean (cid:7) SEM . Statistical analysis was performed in GraphPad Prism 5 . 0 using one - way ANOVA with post - hoc Bonferroni analysis . p < 0 . 05 was considered signi ﬁ cant . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . Characterization of polarized macrophages Monocytes isolated from peripheral human blood were differ - entiated to macrophages through the addition of MCSF , and polarized to different macrophage phenotypes via the addition of speci ﬁ c cytokines ( Fig . 1a ) . Three macrophage phenotypes were prepared ( M1 , M2a , M2c ) and compared to an unactivated control phenotype ( M0 ) . Gene expression analysis revealed that each macrophage phenotype uniquely upregulated speci ﬁ c markers . M1 macro - phages strongly upregulated the in ﬂ ammatory proteins inter - leukin - 1 - beta ( IL1b ) and tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( TNFa ) and the surface markers CCR7 , CD80 , and HLA - DR / MHC Class II ( Fig . 1b ) . M2a macrophages upregulated the cytokines CCL18 and CCL22 and the surface marker MRC1 / CD206 . M2c macrophages could be distin - guished by expression of the scavenger receptor CD163 . Interest - ingly , M2c macrophages , typically considered anti - in ﬂ ammatory , expressed higher levels of the in ﬂ ammatory markers TNFa and HLA - DR than M2a . These levels were lower but not statistically different from M1 macrophages . CD163 þ macrophages have been shown in other reports to secrete in ﬂ ammatory cytokines in response to biomaterials in vitro [ 35 ] and in skin of psoriatic pa - tients [ 23 ] . Flow cytometric analysis was used to con ﬁ rm that the above surface markers are robust indicators of the macrophage pheno - types . CCR7 was expressed more strongly by M1 macrophages , although expression was still detected in the other phenotypes ( Fig . 2a ) . Similarly , CD163 was expressed in the M2c phenotype , and M0 macrophages expressed similar levels . Surprisingly , the puta - tive M2a marker CD206 and the M1 marker HLA - DR were expressed in almost all macrophage phenotypes ( Fig . 2a ) . More - over , a large fraction of CCR7 þ cells of each phenotype was also positive for CD206 , and all CD163 positive cells were positive for CD206 ( Fig . S2a ) , indicating that the mere expression of these markers should not be used as de ﬁ nitive evidence of macrophage phenotype . It should be noted that transcriptional pro ﬁ ling has shown that MCSF - dependent differentiation of monocytes to macrophages is associated with upregulation of a signi ﬁ cant number of M2a - associated genes , suggesting that their “ default ” state under homeostatic conditions might be slightly skewed to the M2a phenotype [ 36 ] . However , the mean ﬂ uorescent intensity per cell , an indication of how strongly each individual cell expressed the marker , revealed signi ﬁ cant differences between the pheno - types ( Fig . 2b and Fig . S2b ) . Thus , expression above a certain threshold of ﬂ uorescence may be useful as a phenotype marker . 3 . 2 . Secretion of proteins related to different stages of angiogenesis We next analyzed the expression of genes and secretion of proteins involved in angiogenesis ( Fig . 3a ) . M1 macrophages expressed genes involved in the initiation of angiogenesis , including those that are chemotactic for endothelial cells : VEGF , basic ﬁ broblast growth factor ( FGF2 ) , IL8 , and CCL5 / RANTES [ 37 e 41 ] . Secretion of VEGF was also con ﬁ rmed on the protein level ( Fig . 3b ) . The in ﬂ ammatory cytokines TNF - alpha and IL1 - beta , secreted by K . L . Spiller et al . / Biomaterials 35 ( 2014 ) 4477 e 4488 4479 M1 macrophages [ 42 ] , have been shown to prime endothelial cells for sprouting by promoting the tip cell phenotype [ 43 ] and to stimulate endothelial cells to recruit supporting pericytes [ 44 ] . Taken together , these results suggest that M1 macrophages are important initiators of angiogenesis . M2a macrophages expressed and secreted high levels of PDGF - BB ( Fig . 3a , b ) , a factor known to recruit pericytes [ 45 , 46 ] and mesenchymal stem cells [ 47 ] , which in turn stabilize the forming vasculature . Without this action , VEGF - stimulated blood vessels are leaky , immature , and prone to regression [ 48 , 49 ] . M1 macrophages also expressed high levels of heparin binding EGF - like growth factor ( HBEGF ) ( Fig . 3a ) , suggesting that they can also recruit peri - cytes . Interestingly , M2a macrophages expressed high levels of tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloprotease - 3 ( TIMP3 ) ( Fig . 3a ) , which inhibits not only the enzymatic activity of MMP9 but also VEGF signaling , by blocking its binding to VEGF receptor 2 to result in potent inhibition of angiogenesis [ 50 ] . TIMP3 also blocks the release of TNF - alpha [ 51 ] . Therefore , M2a macrophages may help support angiogenesis by recruiting pericytes and regulating the signaling of M1 macrophages . Fig . 1 .

Spiller et al . / Biomaterials 35 ( 2014 ) 4477 e 4488 4480 MMP9 is a potent stimulator of angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo , contributing to remodeling of the extracellular matrix in order to allow endothelial cells to migrate , among other functions [ 52 , 53 ] . High levels of MMP9 were secreted by all groups , with M2a mac - rophages secreting signi ﬁ cantly less MMP9 than the other pheno - types ( Fig . 3b ) . The MMP9 was con ﬁ rmed to be enzymatically active by gel zymography ( Fig . 3c ) . 3 . 3 . Effects of macrophage - conditioned media on angiogenesis in vitro To assess the functional role of macrophage - secreted factors in angiogenesis , an in vitro sprouting assay was performed . HUVECs organized into networks with signi ﬁ cantly more sprouts and greater total length in M2c - conditioned media compared to HUVECs in media conditioned by M1 or M2a macrophages ( Fig . 4a ) . Interestingly , conditioned media from M0 macrophages also increased sprouting . The trends in sprouting mirror the secretion pro ﬁ les of MMP9 ( Fig . 3b ) , which is produced at high levels by macrophages and has previously been described to induce endo - thelial sprouting in vitro [ 52 ] . MMP9 has also been shown to promote neovascularization in vivo , partly by proteolytic release of sequestered VEGF [ 54 ] . Future studies are required to con ﬁ rm if macrophage - mediated regulation is dose - responsive with MMP9 . Contrary to the traditional “ angiogenic ” role of M2a macro - phages , endothelial cells in M2a - conditioned medium produced the shortest networks with the least number of sprouts , values that were not statistically different than the baseline media of RPMI with 10 % heat - inactivated human serum ( Fig . 4a ) . No differences in viability or metabolic activity of HUVECs were found during the experimental time frame ( Fig . S3 ) , indicating that cell death was not the reason for the lack of sprouting in M2a - conditioned media . To characterize the effects of changing dynamic signaling from macrophages on angiogenesis in a longer - term assay , endothelial cells were cultured on ﬁ brin gels over 4 days in macrophage - conditioned media . The organization of endothelial cells in media conditioned by a single macrophage phenotype was compared to that of endothelial cells cultured in media that was switched after 24 h from one macrophage phenotype to another . Endothelial cells organized into loosely interconnected clusters in M1 - conditioned media , but not in media conditioned by the other phenotypes or a combination of all three ( Fig . 5 ; higher magni ﬁ cation images in Fig . 3 . Gene expression and protein secretion levels of different macrophage phenotypes . ( a ) Gene expression of proteins typically associated with the initiation of angiogenesis ( VEGF , FGF , IL8 , RANTES ) , the maturation of growing blood vessels ( PDGF - BB , HBEGF ) , and remodeling of the vascular network ( MMP9 , TIMP3 ) ( RT - PCR using monocytes / mac - rophages from n ¼ 9 human donors ) . ( b ) ELISA of macrophage - conditioned media for levels of protein secretion ( n ¼ 4 e 6 human donors ) . ( c ) Enzymatic activity for MMP - 9 was con ﬁ rmed by gel zymography ( representative gel shown , n ¼ 5 human donors ) . Data are presented as mean (cid:7) SEM . * p < 0 . 05 , * * p < 0 . 01 , * * * p < 0 . 001 . K . L . Spiller et al . / Biomaterials 35 ( 2014 ) 4477 e 4488 4481 Fig . S4 ) . When the media was switched at 24 h from M1 - to M2a - conditioned media , simulating the natural transition observed in vivo [ 28 ] , the networking behavior was clearly enhanced , although we did not quantify these changes . Interestingly , this behavior was not observed when endothelial cells were cultured in M1 media followed by M2c or basal media , but it was observed when M2a media followed basal media . Thus , M2a macrophages secrete some signals that cause fusion of sprouting vessels , but only if the signals are removed for a certain period of time , because endothelial cells did not form networks when cultured continu - ously in M2a media . These data are consistent with recent work showing that macrophages guide fusion of sprouting blood vessels in developmental angiogenesis in vivo , ensuring successful completion of angiogenesis [ 55 , 56 ] . The previously observed close physical association of macrophages and fusing endothelial cells in these studies , in combination with the critical role of Notch signaling [ 56 ] , suggested that cell e cell contact was required . In contrast , our study revealed similar effects of cell - secreted factors present in culture media . Although traditional markers of the M1 and M2 phenotype were not assessed in the aforementioned studies of sprout - fusing mac - rophages , they were noted to be antigenically distinct from in - ﬂ ammatory macrophages [ 55 ] . In addition , blood vessel sprouting was induced by VEGF , while macrophage - mediated anastomosis did not involve VEGF . In light of our results , in which M2a macro - phages promoted anastomosis without secreting VEGF , it is tempting to speculate that the macrophages in those studies were of the M2a phenotype . 3 . 4 . Role of macrophage phenotype in vascularization of tissue engineering scaffolds in vivo To con ﬁ rm the roles of macrophage phenotype for vasculariza - tion of biomaterials in vivo , collagen scaffolds designed to elicit a range of macrophage phenotypes were implanted subcutaneously in mice for 10 days . Glutaraldehyde - crosslinked scaffolds were expected to promote a moderate in ﬂ ammatory response [ 13 , 57 ] . Scaffolds soaked in LPS , a component of the bacterial cell wall that is frequently used to polarize macrophages to the M1 phenotype , were expected to elicit a strong M1 response . Unmodi ﬁ ed collagen scaffolds served as a control . There were marked differences in the in ﬂ ammatory responses to the three scaffold groups after 10 days of implantation . A dense ﬁ brous capsule surrounded unmodi ﬁ ed collagen scaffolds ( Fig . 6a and b ) , which has been previously described [ 58 ] . No blood vessels were observed in histological sections , and no staining by the endothelial cell marker CD31 could be detected ( Fig . 6c ) . In contrast , glutaraldehyde - crosslinked scaffolds were well vascular - ized , with visible blood vessel in ﬁ ltration both macroscopically ( Fig . 6a ) and in histological sections ( Fig . 6b ) , where the latter showed abundant staining by CD31 ( Fig . 6c ) . LPS - coated scaffolds were completely in ﬁ ltrated by large numbers of in ﬂ ammatory cells ( Fig . 6b ) with no evidence of blood vessels ( Fig . 6c ) . Both control and LPS - coated scaffolds were considerably smaller and more degraded than the crosslinked scaffolds ( Fig . 6a ) , consistent with the notion that crosslinking prevents degradation [ 59 ] . To identify the macrophage subtypes involved in different in - ﬂ ammatory responses , sections were stained for multiple markers of macrophage phenotype ( Fig . 7a e d ) . Given that differences be - tween murine M2a and M2c macrophages have not been system - atically characterized , we did not attempt to differentiate between these . Instead , we used traditional M1 and M2 markers in combi - nation with the pan - macrophage marker F480 to describe the phenotypes surrounding the scaffolds . Both glutaraldehyde - crosslinked and LPS - coated scaffolds were in ﬁ ltrated by F480 þ macrophages , while macrophages remained primarily in the ﬁ brous capsule surrounding the unmodi ﬁ ed collagen scaffolds ( Fig . 7 ) . Due to the high levels of auto ﬂ uorescence in the glutaraldehyde - crosslinked samples ( Fig . 7e ) , the large numbers of macrophages surrounding the scaffolds , and the fact that positive staining does not necessarily indicate phenotype ( Fig . 2a ) , it was not possible to quantify individual macrophage phenotypes , and the qualitative observations are summarized in Table 1 .

There were no apparent differences in CD206 or CCR7 expression among the groups . The observed contributions of both M1 and M2 macro - phages to angiogenesis in vivo corroborate the in vitro ﬁ ndings and further support the necessity of mobilizing diverse macrophage responses for achieving robust vascularization . 4 . Discussion The roles of various macrophage populations in angiogenesis are controversial and poorly understood [ 60 ] . Despite considerable evidence to the contrary [ 61 ] , M1 macrophages are often consid - ered “ anti - angiogenic ” [ 62 ] , and the pro - ﬁ brotic behavior of M2 macrophages [ 63 e 65 ] is ignored . Given the increasing biological complexity and immunomodulatory potential of biomaterials [ 66 ] , Fig . 7 . Immunohistochemical analysis of macrophage phenotype markers . Sections of explanted scaffolds with surrounding tissue were stained for multiple markers of M1 and M2 macrophage phenotypes in combination with the pan - macrophage marker F480 . M1 markers are TNF a ( a ) , iNOS ( b ) , and CCR7 ( c ) . M2 markers are CD206 ( a ) , Arg1 ( b ) , and CD163 ( d ) . Scale bars are 100 m m . Representative images are shown from n ¼ 4 e 6 replicates . ( e ) Delete primary controls . Glutaraldehyde - crosslinked exhibited substantial auto ﬂ uorescence . K . L . Spiller et al . / Biomaterials 35 ( 2014 ) 4477 e 4488 4484 it is essential to understand which macrophages are bene ﬁ cial to vascularization and healing . Macrophages have been recognized as crucial regulators of healing for a long time [ 67 ] , as their depletion causes drastically reduced angiogenesis and healing [ 55 , 68 e 72 ] , while exogenous addition of macrophages causes increased angiogenesis [ 73 , 74 ] . In one study , vascularization of polymeric scaffolds was entirely dependent on the action of recruited mac - rophages , and was increased by incorporating monocyte chemo - attractant protein - 1 ( MCP - 1 ) [ 1 ] . Tissue engineering strategies that exert control over macrophages would be highly desired as they utilize the body ’ s own healing response to naturally promote regeneration . Blood vessel networks grow through a process of sprouting , anastomosis , and maturation [ 75 ] . In response to angiogenic factors like VEGF , endothelial cells differentiate into tip cells and stalk cells , which lead and support sprouting vessels , respectively . The action of proteases like MMP9 is critical for the sprouting process . Newly sprouted vessels fuse with other vessels in anastomosis , and sup - porting pericytes are recruited via PDGF - BB to stabilize and develop the sprouts into mature vessels . We show that the macrophages of all three activated pheno - types investigated in this study have the potential to contribute to angiogenesis . M1 macrophages secreted factors that are well - described to initiate the process of angiogenesis , including VEGF ; M2a macrophages secreted factors known to be involved at later stages , especially PDGF - BB ; and M2c macrophages pro - moted sprouting in vitro and secreted high levels of MMP9 , suggesting a role in remodeling . Interestingly , factors secreted by M1 and M2c macrophages promoted sprouting of endothelial cells in the short - term Matrigel assay , while M2a signaling pro - moted network formation in the longer - term ﬁ brin assay , but only if the signals were ﬁ rst removed for a period of time . M1 - secreted factors TNF - alpha , IL1 - beta , and VEGF have each been shown to promote blood vessel sprouting by inducing an endo - thelial tip cell phenotype [ 43 , 55 ] , while signaling from M2a macrophages promoted anastomosis ( Fig . 5 ) . Macrophage - mediated anastomosis has been shown to involve Notch1 signaling [ 56 ] , but the secreted factors remain unknown . These results , in combination with the fact that continued presence of M1 and M2 macrophages resulted in neovascularization of scaf - folds in vivo , suggest that coordinated involvement of both sub - sets of macrophages guides new vessel formation ( Fig . 8 ) . We propose a model in which M1 macrophages promote sprouting of blood vessels via secretion of VEGF , bFGF , IL8 , RANTES , and TNF - alpha ; M2c macrophages also support angiogenesis , probably by increasing vascular remodeling given their high levels of pro - duction of MMP9 ; and M2a macrophages promote fusion of blood vessels through currently unidenti ﬁ ed secreted factors . M2a macrophages may also regulate the actions of M1 macrophages via production of TIMP3 , and may recruit pericytes via secretion of PDGF - BB , although these actions were not directly assessed in this study . The interplay between M1 and M2 macrophages in regulating angiogenesis , and particularly the effects of timing , deserves signi ﬁ cantly more attention . While macrophages clearly direct endothelial cell behavior , crosstalk in the other direction has also been described recently . Co - culture with endothelial cells caused macrophages to exhibit M2 polarization , which was partially mediated by VEGF [ 76 , 77 ] . In a porcine model of renal injury , infusion of endothelial outgrowth cells decreased the ratio of M1 / M2 macrophages at the site of injury [ 77 ] . Infusion of VEGF had a similar effect on the macrophages [ 77 ] . From these studies it appears that endothelial cells appear to pro - vide a “ vascular niche ” [ 78 ] that may facilitate the M1 - to - M2 transition , which is required for proper resolution of wound heal - ing . Thus , continued crosstalk between macrophages and endo - thelial cells guides vascularization . In the present study , complete scaffold vascularization was achieved by modifying scaffold properties in order to modulate the in ﬂ ammatory response . Both M1 and M2 macrophages were required to achieve vascularization ; scaffolds with a primarily M2 response were surrounded by a ﬁ brous capsule , and those with a primarily M1 response were characterized by in ﬁ ltrating in ﬂ am - matory cells . The present study and others [ 18 e 20 ] showed that M1 macrophages are bene ﬁ cial for scaffold vascularization in vivo . These results may appear contradictory to those that found increased vascularization of biomaterials with increased numbers of M2 macrophages [ 13 e 17 ] . However , in all of these studies , high numbers of M1 macrophages were also present . In fact , the authors of these studies noted that mixed phenotypes were coincident with vascularization [ 79 ] . Collagen scaffolds were chosen as a model biomaterial to examine the role of macrophage phenotype in vascularization for tissue engineering . Unmodi ﬁ ed collagen scaffolds have been previ - ously reported to provoke ﬁ brous encapsulation [ 58 ] , while cross - linking with glutaraldehyde caused both increased in ﬂ ammation and vascularization in subcutaneous implantation [ 57 ] . The greater levels of M2 marker expression surrounding unmodi ﬁ ed collagen scaffolds suggest involvement in ﬁ brous capsule formation , which has been described elsewhere . For example , when macrophages are forcedtotheM2aphenotype invitro throughtheadditionofIL4 , they fuse into foreign body giant cells , precursors to the ﬁ brous capsule [ 80 ] . IL4 has long been known to be required for ﬁ brous capsule formation in vivo [ 81 ] , which decreases upon inhibition of the M2 marker CD206 [ 82 ] . On the other hand , persistence of M1 macro - phages without M2 macrophages results in chronic in ﬂ ammation and impaired resolution of healing in numerous situations [ 8 e 11 ] . Taken together , the collective data from the present study suggest that ( a ) both M1 and M2 macrophages are required for scaffold Fig . 8 . Proposed model of macrophage - mediated angiogenesis . M1 macrophages promote sprouting of blood vessels via secretion of VEGF , bFGF , IL8 , RANTES , and TNF a . M2a macrophages promote fusion of blood vessels through as - yet unidenti ﬁ ed secreted factors . M2a macrophages may also regulate the actions of M1 macrophages via production of TIMP3 , and may recruit pericytes via secretion of PDGF - BB , although this was not directlyassessed in this study . M2c macrophages may function in vascular remodeling , given their high levels of production of MMP9 .

The results of this study highlight the complexity of macrophage control over angiogenesis , and several future studies are required to fully describe this system . While several studies have pro ﬁ led the differences in gene expression between M1 and M2a macrophages [ 36 ] , very few have quanti ﬁ ed the amount of secreted proteins , the most relevant outcome of polarization , and few studies have addressed the M2c phenotype at all [ 10 , 83 , 84 ] . Most importantly , the kinetics of macrophage - endothelial cell interactions in angio - genesis must be elucidated . It is well known that sequential release of VEGF and PDGF - BB from biomaterial scaffolds increases angio - genesis in vivo [ 85 ] , suggesting that sequential activation of M1 and M2a macrophages , which secrete these two factors , would be bene ﬁ cial . However , in this study , high numbers of M1 macro - phages were present in vascularized scaffolds after ten days of subcutaneous implantation , suggesting a role for M1 macrophages at later times after injury . Studies are underway to investigate these temporal aspects of macrophage polarization . There were some limitations to this study . Most notably , the subcutaneous implantation model is not necessarily clinically relevant , and it is possible that the response of macrophages at other sites of implantation may be different , especially in highly vascular areas such as bone , avascular areas such as cartilage , or load - bearing tissues such as tendon . In addition , the C57BL / 6 strain is a commonly used animal model for biomaterial evaluation , but macrophage behavior is likely to be different in other strains of mice or animal models , and especially in humans [ 86 ] . Moreover , patient comorbidities associated with in ﬂ ammation would almost certainly affect the macrophage response to implanted bio - materials . Another signi ﬁ cant limitation of the study is that macrophage phenotype could not be quanti ﬁ ed in histological sections due to the substantial auto ﬂ uorescence of glutaraldehyde . Future studies should employ ﬂ ow cytometry on digested tissue to quantify polarized macrophage populations . Finally , given the complexity of macrophage responses to biomaterials , which depend on material chemistry , mechanical properties , degradation , etc . [ 66 ] , caution should be exercised in generalizing the results of macrophage response to the scaffolds studied in the present work to that of other biomaterials . For example , glutaraldehyde cross - linking and adsorption of LPS were chosen in order to elicit a moderate and strong M1 response , respectively , but are also likely to have diverse downstream effects . 5 . Conclusions We have systematically characterized three activated macro - phage phenotypes ( M1 , M2a , and M2c ) in the context of angio - genesis and vascularization of tissue engineering scaffolds and found evidence that all three phenotypes support angiogenesis in different ways . M1 and M2c macrophages induced endothelial cell sprouting , while M2a macrophages promoted anastomosis . By modifying scaffold properties to control the macrophage response , we were able to achieve robust scaffold vascularization . Tissue engineering strategies that incorporate knowledge of macrophage behavior may result in control over vascularization and integration , which is critically important for the clinical translation of all tissue - engineering strategies .
