Bausch Lehrstuhl fu¨r Biophysik E27 , Technische Universita¨t Mu¨nchen , James - Franck - Straße 1 , 85748 Garching , Germany ( Received 4 April 2008 ; published 10 September 2008 ) While cells make use of many actin binding proteins ( ABPs ) simultaneously to tailor the mechanical properties of the cytoskeleton , the detailed interplay of different ABPs is not understood . By a combination of macrorheological measurements and confocal microscopy , we show that the ABPs fascin and ﬁlamin modify the structural and viscoelastic properties of composite in vitro actin networks independently . The outnumbering ABP dictates the local network structure and therefore also dominates the macromechanical network response . DOI : 10 . 1103 / PhysRevLett . 101 . 118102 PACS numbers : 87 . 15 . (cid:1) v , 83 . 60 . Bc , 83 . 60 . Df Cell shape , mechanics , and motility are determined by cross - linked and bundled actin networks . As in living cells many different actin binding proteins ( ABPs ) are present simultaneously , it is necessary to study their mechanical function in well - deﬁned in vitro systems where the type and concentration of the ABP can be controlled [ 1 ] . While considerable progress has been made in understanding cytoskeletal networks that are cross - linked or bundled by individual ABPs such as fascin [ 2 ] , ﬁlamin [ 3 ] , or (cid:1) - actinin [ 4 ] , the interplay of different ABPs needs still to be addressed [ 5 ] . While at saturating concentrations a competitive behavior can be expected , it is a priori unclear how multiple ABPs interact in a concentration regime where sufﬁcient binding sites on the actin ﬁlaments are present for each ABP offered . Matters are complicated by the fact that biochemical afﬁnities of most cross - linkers are comparable in magnitude . At the same time , it has been shown that already the pure geometry of cross - linkers signiﬁcantly inﬂuences the structure and with that the mechanical response of such networks [ 6 ] . For short cross - linkers such as fascin , a bundling transition has been observed—where above a critical concentration net - works are composed of straight cross - linked bundles [ 2 ] . In contrast , ﬁlamin creates networks whose constituents are mostly curved and branched bundles . The observed struc - tural differences manifest themselves in distinct mechani - cal signatures—not only in the concentration dependence of the static plateau modulus but also in the viscoelastic frequency spectrum and the nonlinear response . Here we show that fascin and ﬁlamin modify the visco - elastic properties of composite actin networks indepen - dently : By confocal microscopy and macrorheology , we demonstrate that composite actin - fascin - ﬁlamin networks combine the typical structural and mechanical properties that are observed for each pure cross - linked system , i . e . , actin - fascin and actin - ﬁlamin networks , respectively . This can be rationalized by considering the modiﬁcation of the microscopic network properties by the respective cross - linking molecules—both cross - linking molecules contrib - ute to the bundle structure as well as to the interconnec - tivity of the bundles . G - actin is obtained from rabbit skeletal muscle and prepared as described before [ 7 ] . The average length of the actin ﬁlaments is controlled to 21 (cid:2) m using gelsolin obtained from bovine plasma serum following Ref . [ 8 ] . Muscle ﬁlamin was isolated from chicken gizzard and further puriﬁed as reported in Ref . [ 9 ] . Recombinant hu - man fascin was prepared by a modiﬁcation of the method of Ref . [ 10 ] as described by Ref . [ 11 ] . Actin networks with distinct amounts of the ABPs fascin and ﬁlamin are inves - tigated , tuning the molar ratio R of the respective ABP to actin R ¼ c APB = c a over more than three decades up to R ¼ 0 : 2 . Polymerization is initiated by adding a 10 x F - buffer as described in Ref . [ 7 ] . The viscoelastic response of actin - ABP networks is determined by measuring the frequency - dependent viscoelastic moduli G 0 ð f Þ and G 00 ð f Þ with a stress - controlled rheometer ( Physica MCR 301 , Anton Paar , Graz , Austria ) over a frequency range of three dec - ades following Ref . [ 7 ] . To observe the network structures , actin was labeled with phalloidin - TRITC ( Sigma ) . Confocal images were taken with a confocal microscope ( TCS SP5 , Leica , Wetzlar , Germany ) . Confocal images reveal that actin bundles formed by fascin are highly straight in shape [ Fig . 1 ( a ) ] . In contrast , actin bundles formed by ﬁlamin are strongly curved and exhibit branches rather than simple cross - links as observed for fascin [ Fig . 1 ( b ) ] . Composite actin - fascin - ﬁlamin ( a - f - f ) networks show a mixed morphology with straight and curved bundles appearing simultaneously . Branching points and putative cross - links coexist [ Fig . 1 ( c ) ] . Even individual composite bundles combine characteristics of both fascin and ﬁlamin bundles : Straight bundles branch - ing out [ arrow in Fig . 1 ( c ) ] are observed as well as curved bundles showing kinks . The latter are due to the enforced hexatic order of actin ﬁlaments induced by fascin [ 12 ] . Evidently , a - f - f mixtures form homogeneous composite networks without any observable phase separation . Actin networks formed by either fascin or ﬁlamin alone not only exhibit obviously unlike network structures but also show distinct frequency dependencies in their visco - elastic properties . The storage modulus G 0 ð f Þ of a pure fascin bundle network exhibits a plateaulike region at PRL 101 , 118102 ( 2008 ) P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending 12 SEPTEMBER 2008 0031 - 9007 = 08 = 101 ( 11 ) = 118102 ( 4 ) 118102 - 1 (cid:1) 2008 The American Physical Society intermediate frequencies : The modulus changes only about a factor of 2 within the measured frequency range ( 0 . 01 – 10 Hz ) . In contrast , the storage modulus of actin - ﬁlamin networks varies within the same frequency range up to about one decade [ Fig . 2 ( a ) ] . Fitting the storage modulus with a power law G 0 ð f Þ (cid:2) f s over the whole frequency range measured here gives s as a quantity for the steepness of G 0 ð f Þ . Moreover , the loss moduli of the pure systems signiﬁcantly differ : Because of unbinding events occurring between distinct bundles , the loss modulus G 00 ð f Þ of actin - fascin networks shows a well - deﬁned minimum [ 13 ] . However , such a minimum in the viscous dissipation is not observable for actin - ﬁlamin networks , which can be attributed to the fact that in these networks the bundles are branched rather than cross - linked . Thus , cross - linker un - binding might become mechanically relevant only at much longer time scales or high external forces as many unbind - ing events have to occur simultaneously in one bundle to rupture branches—resulting in a plastic deformation of the network . Consistently , very large nonlinear moduli can be reached by ﬁlamin networks even though the linear moduli are quite small [ Fig . 4 ( b ) ] . A characteristic quantity de - scribing the relative magnitude of dissipated energy to stored elastic energy at intermediate frequencies is given by the loss factor (cid:1) ¼ G 00 G 0 ð 0 : 16 Hz Þ . In this study , the concentration of one or both ABPs is varied up to R ¼ 0 : 2 [ Fig . 1 ( d ) ] . In this way , signiﬁcant regions in the phase diagram of a - f - f networks can be explored . In order to avoid saturating concentrations where competitive effects might come into play , it has to be assured that the actin network provides enough binding sites for all ABPs offered . Therefore , the total number of bound ABPs per actin monomer R (cid:3) tot is a crucial parameter to be controlled . R (cid:3) tot ¼ R (cid:3) fas þ R (cid:3) fil < 0 : 25 for all networks observed here [ 14 ] —except for R fas ¼ R fil ¼ 0 : 143 [ Fig . 3 ( c ) ] . As in pure actin - fascin bundle networks no saturation effects are observable below R (cid:3) fas ¼ 0 : 25 [ 12 ] , competitive binding effects between fascin and ﬁla - min can be neglected in the concentration regime inves - tigated here . In order to investigate the viscoelastic properties of composite a - f - f networks , two series of experiments are conducted where the concentration of one ABP is kept constant at R ¼ 0 : 05 while the concentration of the other ABP is increased from R ¼ 0 to R ¼ 0 : 2 ( complete data shown in the supplementary material [ 14 ] ) . Raising R fas in the presence of ﬁlamin results in a continuous ﬂattening of the storage modulus G 0 ð f Þ and therefore a decrease of the storage modulus steepness s [ Fig . 2 ( c ) ] .

The loss modulus G 00 ð f Þ is also ﬂattening with increasing R fas until at R fas ¼ 0 : 1 a distinct minimum appears . With increasing R fas , the loss factor decreases to a value resembling that of a pure fascin network [ Fig . 2 ( d ) ] . These ﬁndings are consistent with results obtained for composite actin - fascin - (cid:1) - actinin networks [ 5 ] , where s as well as (cid:1) of the composite networks were found to have intermediate values compared to those of pure networks . Analogous experiments with a constant R fas ¼ 0 : 05 and increasing amounts of ﬁlamin ( R fil ¼ 0 up to R fil ¼ 0 : 2 ) show complementary results : As R fil is increased , the minimum in the loss modulus continuously disappears , (cid:1) increases [ Fig . 2 ( d ) ] , and the elastic modulus becomes gradually steeper [ Fig . 2 ( c ) ] . At the largest ﬁlamin con - centration investigated ( R fil ¼ 0 : 2 ) , both viscoelastic mod - uli G 0 ð f Þ and G 00 ð f Þ qualitatively reproduce the frequency behavior of a corresponding pure actin - ﬁlamin network [ Figs . 2 ( a ) and 2 ( b ) ] —but at higher absolute values . In summary , one ABP which is present at a distinct higher concentration than the other ABP dominates the micro - structure of the network and with that the shape of the viscoelastic frequency spectrum of a composite network [ Fig . 1 ( d ) ] . Yet the absolute values of both moduli are shifted to higher values . An apparent plateau modulus G 0 ¼ G 0 ð 10 mHz Þ is de - ﬁned to quantify the contribution of the two ABPs fascin and ﬁlamin to the elasticity of the composite network . Increasing R fas in the presence of R fil ¼ 0 : 05 results in an enhancement of the network elasticity G 0 (cid:2) R 1 : 5 fas [ Fig . 3 ( a ) ] , which is exactly the same scaling relation as obtained for pure actin - fascin networks [ 2 ] ( see also [ 14 ] ) . Similarly , the dependence of G 0 on R fil is akin for both pure actin - ﬁlamin and composite a - f - f networks [ Fig . 3 ( b ) ] : The plateau modulus hardly increases at low ﬁlamin concentrations , whereas between R fil ¼ 0 : 005 up to R fil ¼ 0 : 02 it increases about a factor of 5 . Above R fil ¼ 0 : 02 , a decrease of the static network elasticity is observed , which is caused by heterogeneities in density observable above this concentration of ﬁlamin . Yet , as s and (cid:1) are behaving well in this regime , the shape of the frequency spectra G 0 ð f Þ and G 00 ð f Þ is hardly affected by these hetero - geneities . These ﬁndings show that fascin and ﬁlamin modify the network elasticity of the composite network independently as the mechanical enhancement caused by one ABP is unaffected by the presence of the other one . The observed independent modiﬁcation suggests that the plateau modulus factorizes to functions which each solely depend on the concentration of a single ABP : G 0 ð R fas ; R fil Þ ¼ 1 G 0 a G fas0 ð R fas Þ G fil0 ð R fil Þ , where G 0 a denotes the plateau modulus of a pure actin solution . To further test this hypothesis , the concentrations of both ABPs fascin and ﬁlamin are increased simultaneously ( R fil ¼ R fas ) . The resulting strong increase of the network elasticity closely matches what is expected concerning the suggested facto - rization in combination with the already measured depen - dencies G fas0 ð R fas Þ and G fil0 ð R fil Þ [ Fig . 3 ( c ) ] . Surprisingly , this holds true even at very high R fil —despite occurring heterogeneities . Already the linear response regime provides evidence for the independent behavior of fascin and ﬁlamin . However , further conﬁrmation might be given by analyzing the nonlinear properties of composite a - f - f networks . The inherently pronounced differences in the nonlinear re - sponse of either fascin or ﬁlamin networks are ideally suited to test the proposed independent modiﬁcation of the mechanical properties of composite networks by one distinct ABP . The nonlinear behavior is studied best with a constant shear rate d(cid:3)dt to minimize creep artifacts during the measurement [ 15 ] . From the recorded stress - strain relation (cid:4) ð (cid:3) Þ , the differential modulus K ð (cid:3) Þ ¼ @ (cid:4) @ (cid:3) is calculated [ 15 ] . In pure actin - fascin networks , a continuous decrease in the degree of strain hardening is observed as a function of increasing R fas [ Fig . 4 ( c ) ] . This is attributable to forced unbinding events occurring between distinct fascin bundles [ 13 ] . However , the branched bundle structures formed by ﬁlamin give rise to a qualitatively different nonlinear be - havior as strain hardening can be observed over the whole concentration regime in pure actin - ﬁlamin networks . In detail , within this strain - hardening regime K follows a power law K (cid:2) (cid:3) x . At the protein concentrations investi - gated here , the nonlinear exponent x (cid:4) 4 —describing the degree of strain hardening—is independent of R fil [ Fig . 4 ( d ) ] . Interestingly , this inﬂuence of fascin and ﬁla - min on the nonlinear response is conferrable to composite networks : Adding fascin to actin - ﬁlamin networks lowers the degree of strain hardening [ Fig . 4 ( c ) ] . In contrast , adding ﬁlamin to actin - fascin networks again results in a constant degree of hardening [ Fig . 4 ( d ) ] . Because of the presence of fascin , the nonlinear exponent x ¼ 1 : 1 is clearly lower than the corresponding value for pure actin - ﬁlamin networks . This independent tunability of the non - linear response underlines the independent modiﬁcation of 1 10 100 0 . 01 0 . 1 G [ P a ] 0 R fascin filamin A R B 10 100 0 . 01 0 . 1 R fas = R fil C 0 . 1 1 10 100 0 . 001 0 . 01 0 . 1 1 FIG . 3 ( color online ) .

In conclusion , composite a - f - f networks provide an enormous mechanical adaptability as tuning the concen - trations of either ABP allows for adjusting a wide range of linear and nonlinear viscoelastic properties . A - f - f networks combine structural and mechanical properties of pure actin - fascin and pure actin - ﬁlamin networks . Both cross - linking molecules modify the linear and the nonlinear viscoelastic properties independently . The abundant cross - linker dominates the bundle conﬁguration and the network microstructure—resulting in a macromechanical dominance in the composite network . The presence of another cross - linker which is distinctly less prominent in density only results in an offset in the viscoelastic proper - ties . The mechanical and structural modiﬁcation of the network by increasing amounts of a given cross - linker remains the same : The bundle microstructure as well as the interconnectivity of the bundles is modiﬁed in the composite a - f - f network exactly the same way as in pure actin - fascin networks and pure actin - ﬁlamin networks , respectively—depending on which ABP concentration is tuned . This demonstrates that different actin binding pro - teins can fulﬁll their mechanical function independently of each other without inducing any phase separation—not even on the local scale of single bundles . The described independent modiﬁcation of the network elasticity is in marked contrast to a proposed synergistic enhancement of the static network elasticity by fascin and (cid:1) - actinin [ 5 ] . However , in that study , the elastic modulus was found to be almost independent from the fascin concentration for R fas > 0 : 02 —in sharp contrast to our ﬁndings presented here and elsewhere [ 2 ] . The strikingly simple independent behavior conﬁrms a reductionist’s approach of studying in vitro networks that are cross - linked with only one single ABP : This method allows for the prediction of the domi - nating properties of more complex composite networks . In fact , a composite in vitro network with R fil ¼ R fas ¼ 0 : 05 reproduces the generic power law behavior [ 14 ] observed for living cells [ 16 ] , which might simply be a result of structural heterogeneities and complicated cross - linker dy - namics . However , the structural diversity of composite actin networks as well as the independent mechanical modiﬁcation of the network by single ABPs need further theoretical attention . The observed mechanical redundancy and adaptability of composite actin networks are yet an - other possibility for cells to tailor their physical properties according to their needs . We thank M .
