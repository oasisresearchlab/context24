Schultz , December 17 , 2004 The Wnt signaling pathway acts ubiquitously in metazoans to control various aspects of embryonic development . Wnt ligands bind their receptors Frizzled and low - density lipoprotein receptor - related protein 5 (cid:1) 6 and function through Disheveled ( Dvl ) , Axin , adenomatous polyposis coli , glycogen synthase kinase 3 (cid:1) , and casein kinase ( CK ) 1 to stabilize (cid:1) - catenin and induce lymphocyte enhancer - binding factor ( LEF ) (cid:1) T cell factor ( TCF ) - dependent tran - scriptional activities . To identify previously unrecognized Wnt signaling modulators , a genome - wide functional screen was per - formed using large - scale arrayed cDNA collections . From this screen , both known components and previously uncharacterized regulators of this pathway were identiﬁed , including (cid:1) - catenin , Dvl1 , Dvl3 , Fbxw - 1 , Cul1 , CK1 (cid:2) , CK1 (cid:3) , and (cid:4) - catenin . In particular , a previously unrecognized activator , LRRFIP2 ( leucine - rich repeat in Flightless interaction protein 2 ) , was found that interacts with Dvl to increase the cellular levels of (cid:1) - catenin and activate (cid:1) - catenin (cid:1) LEF (cid:1) TCF - dependent transcriptional activity . The function of LR - RFIP2 is blocked when a dominant negative Dvl ( Xdd1 ) is coex - pressed . Expression of LRRFIP2 in Xenopus embryos induced doubleaxisformationandWnttargetgeneexpression ; adominant negative form of LRRFIP2 suppresses ectopic Wnt signaling in Xenopus embryos and partially inhibits endogenous dorsal axis formation . These data suggest that LRRFIP2 plays an important role in transducing Wnt signals . genome - wide functional screen (cid:2) Xenopus (cid:2) Wnt signaling pathway (cid:2) Disheveled S ignaling by the Wnt family of ligands mediates various aspects of embryonic development , ranging from tissue patterning to morphogenesis . Many of the Wnt ligands activate the so - called canonical pathway , which signals by regulating the cytoplasmic abundance of (cid:1) - catenin ( 1 – 5 ) . In the absence of Wnt signaling , the cytoplasmic level of (cid:1) - catenin is kept low through its interaction with a protein complex comprised of APC , Axin , glycogen synthase kinase 3 (cid:1) ( GSK - 3 (cid:1) ) , and casein kinase ( CK ) 1 ( 1 , 2 ) . Phosphorylation of (cid:1) - catenin by CK1 and GSK - 3 (cid:1) results in its ubiquitination by the Skp1 – Cul1 – Fbox ubiquitin - conjugation complex and subsequent degradation by means of the proteasome ( 1 , 2 ) . Binding of the Wnt ligands to their receptors , Frizzled and low - density lipoprotein receptor - related protein 5 (cid:1) 6 , leads to activation of the adaptor protein , Dishev - eled ( Dvl ) , and the inhibition of GSK - 3 (cid:1) , resulting in the accumulation of cytoplasmic (cid:1) - catenin . At elevated cytoplasmic levels , (cid:1) - catenin translocates to the nucleus , where it interacts with members of the T cell factor ( TCF ) (cid:1) lymphocyte enhancer - binding factor ( LEF ) family of DNA - binding proteins . (cid:1) - Catenin binding to TCF (cid:1) LEF converts it from a transcriptional repressor to an activator of Wnt target genes such as c - Myc , cyclin D1 , and multiple developmental regulators ( 1 , 2 ) . Although many of the core components required for canonical Wnt signaling are known , many details of how signals are passed from one component to the next remain obscure . For example , the cellular signal transducer Dvl is one of the key components in the pathway ( 1 , 2 ) , yet it is not known how Dvl is activated upon binding of Wnt ligand to its receptors ( 6 – 8 ) or , likewise , how Dvl transduces the signal by inhibiting the downstream effector , GSK - 3 (cid:1) . Similarly , certain Wnt ligands activate other downstream pathways , some of which also involve Dvl , but how these pathways diverge from or interact with the canonical pathway is largely unknown . Consequently , the identification of additional components that may either be essential for Wnt signaling or modulate the activity of the core components is critical to a better understanding of the role of the Wnt pathway in development and cancer . The recent availability of genome sequences of human and model organisms has provided an opportunity to study signaling pathways by using functional genome - wide approaches , including screening of large - scale small interfering RNA and cDNA collections ( 9 – 14 ) . To identify additional components and modulators of the Wnt signaling pathway , we have screened a large arrayed and ad - dressable cDNA library ( (cid:1) 20 , 000 cDNAs ) for clones that mod - ulate (cid:1) - catenin - dependent activities in cultured cells . Clones isolated in this screen encode known components of the Wnt pathway as well as previously unrecognized potential regulators of Wnt signaling . In particular , one of the clones encodes human LRRFIP2 ( leucine - rich repeat in Flightless interaction protein 2 ) , a protein of previously unknown function . We show that LRRFIP2 is able to activate the canonical Wnt pathway in both cultured mammalian cells and in Xenopus embryos . LRRFIP2 binds to Dvl , and the region involved in binding is required for its activity both in cultured cells and in embryos . Finally , we show that a putative dominant negative form of LRRFIP2 can sup - press ectopic Wnt signaling in Xenopus embryos and partially inhibits endogenous dorsal axis formation . These data suggest strongly that LRRFIP2 is a previously unrecognized component of the Wnt signaling pathway that mediates or modulates Wnt signaling through interactions with Dvl . Materials and Methods High - Throughput Transfection and Reporter Assay . Human embry - onic kidney ( HEK ) 293T cells were cultured in DMEM ( Invitro - gen ) supplemented with 10 % FBS and antibiotics ( 100 units (cid:1) ml penicillin and 100 (cid:2) g (cid:1) ml streptomycin ) . High - throughput re - verse transfection and screening was carried out by using an arrayed library collection containing (cid:1) 20 , 000 cDNAs from the Origene collection and Mammalian Genome Collection as de - scribed in refs . 9 , 10 , and 12 . Briefly , each individual cDNA plasmid ( 62 . 5 ng ) in the collection was spotted into a single well of 384 - well cell culture plates .

After incubation at room temperature for 30 min , 20 % FBS DMEM ( 20 (cid:2) l ) containing 10 4 HEK293T cells was plated into each well . Cells were then cultured in a humidified incubator at 37°C in 5 % CO 2 . After 48 h , BrightGlo ( Promega ) reagent ( 40 (cid:2) l ) was added to each well , and luciferase lumines - cence was measured with an Acquest plate reader ( LJL Biosys - tems , Sunnyvale , CA ) .

Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis . Coimmunoprecipi - tation and Western blot analysis were performed as described in ref . 15 . Briefly , whole - cell lysates were pretreated with mouse IgG and protein G agarose . Flag - tagged proteins were immu - noprecipitated from supernatants by mouse anti - Flag monoclo - nal antibody ( M2 , Sigma ) conjugated to agarose ( Sigma ) . For immunoblots , immunoprecipitants or cellular proteins were mixed with Laemmli SDS sample buffer . Total cellular proteins ( 40 (cid:2) g per lane ) were separated by 4 – 20 % gradient Tris - glycine SDS (cid:1) PAGE ( Invitrogen ) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane . Proteins were detected with primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase - conjugated secondary antibodies by us - ing an enhanced chemiluminescence kit ( Amersham Bio - sciences ) . Primary antibodies used were mouse anti - c - Myc monoclonal antibody ( 9E10 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , mouse anti - Flag monoclonal antibody ( M2 , Sigma ) , mouse anti - (cid:3) - tubulin monoclonal antibody ( Sigma ) , and mouse anti - (cid:1) - catenin monoclonal antibody ( C - 19220 , Transduction Laboratories , Lexington , KY ) . Xenopus Microinjection . Xenopus eggs were in vitro fertilized following established methods ( 16 ) . Embryos were raised in 0 . 1 (cid:2) Marc’s modified Ringer’s solution and staged according to the methods of Nieuwkoop and Faber ( 17 ) . Capped RNAs were transcribed in vitro by using the mMessage - mMachine kit ( Am - bion , Austin , TX ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Synthetic RNAs were microinjected into the two - or four - cell - stage embryos . After 48 h , the axis duplication phenotype was scored . For the animal cap explant experiment , synthetic RNAs were microinjected into the animal pole of two - cell stage em - bryos . At stage 8 . 5 , animal caps were dissected and allowed to develop to stage 10 . 5 . Explants were harvested , and RNAs were extracted by using TRIzol ( Invitrogen ) . The first - strand cDNAs were synthesized by using the SuperScript III First Strand System ( Invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . One to two microliters of the cDNA - synthesizing reaction was used for PCRs . The sequences of the primers used for RT - PCR are available upon request . Histology section and staining were performed as described in ref . 16 . Results and Discussion Identification of LRRFIP2 as a Wnt Signaling Modulator . To identify additional modulators of Wnt signaling , a genome - wide functional screen was performed with a large - scale cDNA collection contain - ing (cid:1) 20 , 000 cDNAs ( described in detail in Materials and Methods ) . Briefly , cDNAs were prespotted on 384 - well cell culture plates as individual clones and then assayed by transfection into HEK293T cells along with a TOPflash reporter . The level of TOPflash reporter activity was used as an indicator of TCF (cid:1) LEF - dependent transcriptional activity and , indirectly , (cid:1) - catenin levels ( 18 ) . Each well that scored positive from a luminescence readout of reporter luciferase activity was retested on both TOPflash and on a negative control FOPflash construct carrying mutations in the (cid:1) - catenin (cid:1) TCF - responsive elements ( 18 ) . A variety of known components (cid:1) modulators of the Wnt pathway were identified in the screen ( Table 1 , which is pub - lished as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) , includ - ing (cid:1) - catenin , Dvl1 , Dvl3 , Fbxw - 1 , CK1 (cid:4) , CK1 (cid:5) , and (cid:3) - catenin ( 1 , 2 ) . Cul1 and the ubiquitin - conjugating enzyme E2 , which are components of the Skp1 – Cul1 – Fbox complex that regulates the ubiquitination of (cid:1) - catenin ( 19 ) , also were identified . In addi - tion , the screen identified previously unrecognized proteins that have not been associated with (cid:1) - catenin regulation and (cid:1) or Wnt signaling , including KIAA1190 , ecotropic viral insertion site 3 ( Evi3 ) , Ring finger gene 4 ( Rnf4 ) , and LRRFIP2 ( Table 1 ) . KIAA1190 is an uncharacterized protein containing eight pu - tative zinc fingers . Evi3 , which contains 30 zinc fingers , is frequently up - regulated in mouse B cell lymphomas and func - tions in B cell development and oncogenesis ( 20 ) . Rnf4 is a Ring finger - containing factor that is involved in transcription factor activation , nuclear trafficking , and ubiquitin conjugation ( 21 – 23 ) . These proteins may play a role in (cid:1) - catenin nuclear trans - location and formation of active TCF (cid:1) LEF transcription complexes . The clone encoding LRRFIP2 was one of the strongest positives identified in the screen , inducing the TOPflash reporter activity 20 - to 30 - fold over background and , therefore , was characterized more fully . Human LRRFIP2 was originally iden - tified in a two - hybrid screen using human Flightless - I ( 24 ) , an actin - binding protein ( 25 ) , as a bait . However , the significance of this potential interaction and the genetic and biochemical func - tion of LRRFIP2 are unknown . LRRFIP2 was shown to be expressed as a long and short form , representing alternatively spliced variants ( 24 ) . Although the screen only identified the long form , subsequent analysis showed that the short form has similar albeit weaker activity in the TOPflash reporter assay . The obvious structural features of LRRFIP2 are a predicted coiled - coil domain at its carboxyl terminus ( 24 ) and a Ser - rich region at the amino terminus , a potential site for posttranslational modification . A search of public databases did not reveal ho - mologous orthologs of LRRFIP2 in either Caenorhabditis elegans or Drosophila , although the genes CG8578 - PA ( accession no . AAF48525 ) in Drosophila and F57B9 . 7 ( accession no . AAM48538 ) in C . elegans are partially homologous to the carboxyl terminus of LRRFIP2 . However , we were able to isolate a cDNA encoding the long form of Xenopus LRRFIP2 from an embryonic cDNA library by PCR . Alignment of the frog and human proteins indicates a high level of overall amino acid conservation ( 75 % ) , with particularly high levels in the amino terminus ( 92 % ) as well as in the predicted coiled - coiled domain ( 94 % ) ( Fig . 6 , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) , suggesting that these regions encode conserved essential functions . Overexpression of LRRFIP2 in HEK293T cells robustly ac - tivates the TOPflash reporter activity in a dose - dependent manner ( Fig . 1 A ) . The specificity of this activation was con - firmed by using the negative control FOPflash reporter as well as other reporter constructs , such as a p53 - responsive reporter and a sonic hedgehog - responsive reporter ( data not shown ) . No activity was detected with LRRFIP2 using either of these reporters . To test whether LRRFIP2 activates the canonical Wnt signaling pathway by modulating the level of free (cid:1) - catenin ( 1 , 2 ) , LRRFIP2 was transfected into HEK293T cells and the levels of cytoplasmic (cid:1) - catenin were measured by Western blot anal - 1928 (cid:2) www . pnas . org (cid:1) cgi (cid:1) doi (cid:1) 10 . 1073 (cid:1) pnas . 0409472102 Liu et al . ysis . As shown in Fig . 1 D , expression of LRRFIP2 in HEK293T cells results in a significant increase in the cytoplasmic level of (cid:1) - catenin , suggesting that the induction of the TOPflash re - porter activity by LRRFIP2 is mediated through (cid:1) - catenin . Injection of LRRFIP2 in XenopusEmbryos Induces Double Axis Forma - tion and Wnt Target Gene Expression . Dorsal axis formation in Xenopus embryos is a well established model for assaying activators and inhibitors of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway ( 1 , 2 ) . Ectopic activation of this pathway in early embryos leads to double axis formation ( 26 ) . To examine the activity of LRRFIP2 in Xenopus , capped synthetic LRRFIP2 RNAs were injected at the ventral marginal zone into two - cell - stage em - bryos . As shown in Fig . 1 B , LRRFIP2 induces axis duplication with high penetrance ( 80 % , n (cid:3) 45 ) , whereas embryos injected with a GFP RNA control developed normally ( 100 % , n (cid:3) 50 ) . Histological staining ( Fig . 1 C ) revealed that the LRRFIP2 - induced second axis contained a secondary notochord and neural tube morphologically indistinguishable from those in the primary axis . Thus , ectopic expression of LRRFIP2 in embryos produces a phenotype consistent with Wnt activation . Activation of canonical Wnt signaling in early embryos pro - duces a secondary dorsal axis by inducing the expression of Spemann organizer genes , including Siamois and Xnr3 ( 1 , 2 ) . To test whether LRRFIP2 also promotes dorsal axis formation by inducing Wnt target gene expression , the induction of Siamois and Xnr3 RNA by LRRFIP2 was measured in animal cap assays . Animal caps were isolated at stage 8 . 5 from embryos injected at the two - cell stage with LRRFIP2 or GFP RNA , cultured to stage 10 . 5 , and then assayed by using RT - PCR for Siamois and Xnr3 RNA . As shown in Fig . 1 E , LRRFIP2 strongly induces the expression of Siamois and Xnr3 to levels comparable to those induced by (cid:1) - catenin ; injection of a GFP RNA control had no effect . These data suggest that LRRFIP2 can indeed function as a Wnt signaling activator in Xenopus . The Amino Terminus of LRRFIP2 Functions as a Dominant Negative Form . To begin to analyze the molecular function of LRRFIP2 , a series of deletion mutants was constructed as shown in Fig . 2 and then tested for their ability to activate the TOPflash reporter when expressed in HEK293T cells . The ability of LRRFIP2 to activate the TOPflash reporter was severely reduced after truncation of either the carboxyl terminus or the amino termi - Fig . 1 .

HEK293T cells were transfected with a reporter construct ( TOPﬂash or FOPﬂash ) , an internal control ( Renilla luciferase ) , and an increasing amount of LRRFIP2 in 96 - well cell culture plates .

In contrast , deletion of the central region , which presum - ably mediates the interaction with Flightless - I ( 24 ) , had little or no effect on LRRFIP2 activity . To search for candidate dominant negative forms , the deletion constructs were cotransfected along with full - length LRRFIP2 into HEK293T cells . The LRRFIP2 mutant containing amino acids 1 – 400 weakly stimulates reporter activity , precluding its use as a dominant negative . The LRRFIP2 mutant containing the carboxyl - terminal 250 amino acids , although inactive in reporter assay , was unable to inhibit the activation of TOPflash by full - length LRRFIP2 . However , mutants M4 and M5 , con - sisting of amino - terminal fragments containing amino acids 1 – 200 and 1 – 370 , respectively , strongly inhibit the activity of LRRFIP2 and function as dominant negative mutants . Taken together , the above results indicate that protein interactions at both the amino and carboxyl termini are required for LRRFIP2 to activate Wnt signaling . LRRFIP2 Interacts with Dvl3 . To explore the mechanism by which LRRFIP2 activates Wnt signaling , the binding of LRRFIP2 to components in the Wnt pathway was assayed by coimmunopre - cipitation . A Flag - tagged form of LRRFIP2 was introduced into HEK293T cells , along with Myc - tagged forms of Dvl3 , Axin , or GSK - 3 (cid:1) by cotransfection . After 48 h , Myc - tagged and associ - ated proteins were recovered from cell lysates by immunopre - cipitation and then probed by Western blots for Flag - LRRFIP2 with an anti - Flag antibody ( Fig . 3 A ) . The results show that LRRFIP2 can be coimmunoprecipated in a complex with Dvl3 but not detectably with Axin or GSK - 3 (cid:1) ( data not shown ) . The region of LRRFIP2 that binds to Dvl3 was determined from binding assays of Dvl3 with the LRRFIP2 deletion con - structs described in Fig . 2 . Extracts were prepared from HEK293T cells that were cotransfected with a Myc - tagged Dvl3 and the various Flag - tagged deletion mutants of LRRFIP2 . Binding interactions were scored by immunoprecipitating Myc - Dvl and probing with a Flag - tag antibody on Western blots or vice versa . As shown in Fig . 3 B , Myc - Dvl3 was detected in the immunoprecipitants of Flag - LRRFIP2 - M4 , Flag - LRRFIP2 - M5 , and Flag - LRRFIP2 - M6 . When cell lysates were immunoprecipi - tated with an anti - Myc antibody , Flag - LRRFIP2 - M5 and Flag - LRRFIP2 - M6 were readily detected in the immunoprecipitants as shown in Fig . 3 C ( Flag - LRRFIP2 - M4 migrates at the same position as the light chain of IgG , making it undetectable in this assay ) . Together , these data indicate that LRRFIP2 binds to Dvl3 through its amino terminus . Consistent with this interpre - tation , a LRRFIP2 mutant containing only the region required for binding to Dvl3 functions as a dominant negative mutant . The carboxyl terminus of LRRFIP2 , which does not detectably interact with Dvl3 , also seems to be required for its function ( Fig . 2 ) , presumably through interactions with other components of the Wnt pathway ( or yet unknown factors ) , which function synergistically with LRRFIP2 to activate Dvl . It is worth noting that Western blot analysis of the LRRFIP2 truncated mutant afforded high molecular weight bands at trace levels , raising the possibility that LRRFIP2 is posttranslationally modified and that this modification could modulate its ability to interact with other proteins . Dvl3 mediates Wnt signaling through three key domains : the DIX domain at the amino terminus , the PDZ domain in the central region , and the DEP domain near the carboxyl terminus ( 1 , 2 ) . Each of these domains likely mediates protein – protein interactions that allow the Dvl proteins to act as scaffolding proteins during Wnt signaling ( 27 – 36 ) . To determine which of these domains binds LRRFIP2 , a series of truncation mutants of Dvl3 ( Fig . 7 A , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) was assayed with the coimmunoprecipitation protocol described above . Extracts were prepared from HEK293T cells coexpressing Flag - tagged LRRFIP2 - M5 and Myc - tagged deletions of Dvl3 , subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti - Flag antibody , and analyzed by Western blots to detect the bound Myc - tagged Dvl3 proteins . As shown in Fig . 7 B , the region containing both the PDZ and DEP domains is responsible for the interaction with LRRFIP2 - M5 . Each domain alone cannot bind LRRFIP2 - M5 efficiently . Similar results were obtained when the Dvl3 mutant constructs were cotransfected with the full - length Flag - tagged LRRFIP2 ( data not shown ) . These experiments suggest that binding of LRRFIP2 to Dvl3 involves residues from both the PDZ and DEP domains and (cid:1) or the hinge region between the two . Moreover , forms of Dvl3 Fig . 3 .

In vitro GST pull - down assays also were carried out to test the direct interaction between LRRFIP2 and Dvl . GST - LRRFIP2 ( 1 – 370 ) indeed could pull down in vitro translated Dvl3 ( 80 – 510 ) but with much lower efficiency than immunoprecipitation in HEK293T cells ( data not shown ) . It is possible that phosphor - ylation of Dvl is required for the direct binding , because Dvl is heavily phosphorylated when expressed in cells , whereas the in vitro translated Dvl is not . It was next determined whether LRRFIP2 functions within the Wnt pathway at the level of Dvl . A dominant negative form of Dvl ( Xdd1 ) that lacks the PDZ domain ( 37 ) was assayed for its ability to inhibit LRRFIP2 - induced TOPflash reporter activity in cultured cells . As shown in Fig . 4 A , coexpression of Xdd1 totally abolished the activity of LRRFIP2 . Furthermore , we tested whether the dominant negative mutant , LRRFIP2 - M5 , blocks the ability of Dvl3 to activate the TOPflash reporter in cultured cells . Again , dominant negative LRRFIP2 dramatically reduced Dvl3 - activated reporter activity ( Fig . 4 B ) but not the reporter activity promoted by (cid:1) - catenin ( data not shown ) . Taken together , these data suggest that LRRFIP2 may function in the Wnt pathway in association with Dvl3 , and vice versa , both acting upstream of (cid:1) - catenin . LRRFIP2 Plays a Role in Axis Formation inXenopus . The results above show that LRRFIP2 is a potent activator of Wnt signaling in Xenopus embryos . To test whether LRRFIP2 is required for Wnt signaling in this context , its expression pattern during Xenopus development was examined by RT - PCR . As shown in Fig . 5 A , a PCR product corresponding to the shorter form of LRRFIP2 is expressed at high levels maternally and throughout early devel - opment . In addition , a PCR band corresponding to the longer form also was detected but only after the midblastula transition at low levels , becoming readily detectable after stage 14 . As described above , the short form of LRRFIP2 lacks amino acids 61 – 294 , which are found in the longer form , but retains the conserved regions and also activates Wnt signaling , although with a lower efficiency compared with the long form of LRRFIP2 . This result indicates that LRRFIP2 is expressed in early embryos , where it could function in Wnt signaling , and , moreover , raises the possibility that its functional capacity could be regulated by alternative splicing .

Stage - 2embryoswereinjectedwith DN - LRRFIP2 ( 2 ng ) at multiple positions along the dorsal ventral axis and were scored by using the dorsoanterior index ( DAI ) at tadpole stages ( 39 ) . Thirty - one percent of the injected embryos have gastrulation defects . Among gastrulated embryos , 23 % show mild ventralization phenotypes ( DAI 4 ) , represented by the light - coloredbar ; 7 % oftheembryosshowmicrocephalicoracephalicphenotypes ( DAI1 – 3 ) , representedbythedark - coloredbar . Thecombinedhypodorsalized embryos are (cid:1) 30 % . Liu et al . PNAS (cid:2) February 8 , 2005 (cid:2) vol . 102 (cid:2) no . 6 (cid:2) 1931 C E LL B I O L O G Y We then tested whether expression of the dominant negative mutant , LRRFIP2 - M5 , would suppress double axis formation in response to expression of xWnt8 . Injection of RNA encoding LRRFIP2 - M5 led to a significant reduction of double axis formation induced by xWnt8 ( Fig . 5 B ) but had little or no effect on double axis formation by (cid:1) - catenin ( data not shown ) . These data suggest that LRRFIP2 may indeed be required for Wnt signaling and operate upstream of (cid:1) - catenin , as suggested by the results in tissue culture cells described above . To determine whether LRRFIP2 is involved in endogenous axis formation , RNA encoding the dominant negative LRRFIP2 was injected at multiple positions along the dorsal ventral axis . A small but reproducible number of injected embryos showed hypodorsalized phenotypes , such as reduced head structures , indicative of reduced Wnt signaling ( Fig . 5 C ) . These phenotypes , although weak , were not observed in control embryos injected with a control (cid:1) - gal RNA , indicating that LRRFIP2 might be at least partially required for dorsal axis formation in Xenopus . It cannot be ruled out that LRRFIP2 may function by means of its interactions with Dvl in other arms of the Wnt signaling pathway . In this respect , we have observed defects in gastrulation that might be consistent with the role of the Wnt pathway in convergent extension movements . The additional roles of LRRFIP2 in normal Xenopus development await further study . Conclusions LRRFIP2 , a gene of previously unknown function , was iden - tified as a modulator of Wnt signaling by a genome - wide functional screen . LRRFIP2 interacts with Dvl to increase the cellular abundance of (cid:1) - catenin and activate TCF (cid:1) LEF - dependent gene transcription . Both the amino and carboxyl termini of LRRFIP2 are required for its function . The amino terminus of LRRFIP2 is responsible for interaction with the central region of Dvl , which contains the PDZ and DEP domains ; a mutant of LRRFIP2 containing only the amino terminus acts as a dominant negative form . One possibility is that LRRFIP2 interacts with Dvl and acts as a scaffold protein to facilitate the activation of Dvl , leading to the stabilization of (cid:1) - catenin ; disruption of this interaction with a dominant negative LRRFIP2 abolishes the activities of both . LRRFIP2 promotes the formation of a second dorsal axis in Xenopus embryos and induces the expression of organizer genes in animal caps . The dominant negative LRRFIP2 mutant sup - presses xWnt8 dorsalizing activity , partially inhibits dorsal axis formation , and , in some embryos , reduces the levels of embry - onic myogenesis , a process that is also known to require Wnt signaling within the dorsal and ventral marginal zone after the midblastula transition . Taken together , these results provide compelling evidence that LRRFIP2 transduces Wnt signals through the canonical pathway . The lack of homologs of LRRFIP2 in invertebrates may be an indication that the primary function of LRRFIP2 in vertebrates may not be as a core component of Wnt signaling but as a modulator that is used to expand the signaling potential of the pathway , thus adding a new level of regulation during embryonic development . In this respect , LRRFIP2 could be akin to other signal modulators , such as Dkk1 , Frodo , and Dapper , that modulate Wnt signaling but are unique to vertebrates ( 30 , 31 , 38 ) .
