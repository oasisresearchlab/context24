Expanded View Figures ◀ Figure EV 1 . Tamoxifen inhibits spreading , matrix attachment , and invasion in macrophages . A Time - elapsed sequential images of macrophages until cells attained maximum area , scale bar is 10 l m . B Quantification of macrophage spreading over time , values represent mean (cid:1) s . e . m . n = 15 cells per condition ( FN , fibronectin ) . C – E Quantification of cell number ratio , area , and roundness ( panels C and E n = 30 cells per condition , and numbers are relative to control – 1 kPa ) . F Representative images of macrophage attachment to 1 and 25 kPa polyacrylamide matrices , scale bar is 50 l m . G Representative images of the transwell inserts showing crystal violet - stained invading macrophages , scale bar is 50 l m . H Quantification of macrophage invasion for panel ( G ) . I Bright field images of the bottom of the lower chamber that contained the inserts showing the invading macrophages that reached these surfaces in the control and tamoxifen and GPER antagonist conditions , scale bar is 50 l m . Data information : Histogram bars represent mean (cid:1) s . e . m . ( t - test for B , C , D , and E ; and ANOVA and Tukey ’ s test for H * * * P < 0 . 001 ) . For all panels , three experimental replicates . ▸ EMBO reports Mechanoregulation in PDAC via GPER Ernesto Cortes et al EV 1 EMBO reports e 46556 | 2018 ª 2018 The Authors A B F G H I C D E Figure EV 1 .
