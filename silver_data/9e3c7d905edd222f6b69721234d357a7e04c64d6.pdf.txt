This study describes COVID - 19 - related morbidity in the PARIS birth cohort families during the ﬁrst lockdown in France and identiﬁes family proﬁles in terms of morbidity , perception , behaviors , and attitudes . Methods : Online questionnaires were sent to adolescents of the PARIS birth cohort and their parents . Possible COVID - 19 was deﬁned by symptoms using the ECDC deﬁnition . Household transmission was estimated by calculating the observed clinical secondary attack rates . Perception , behaviors and attitudes were assessed by levels of stress , degree of satisfaction regarding levels of information about COVID - 19 , degree of agreement with the lockdown and preventive measures . COVID - 19 morbidity in adolescents and parents was compared using chi - squared or Student’s t - tests . Within each family , perception , behaviors , and attitudes were compared between adolescents and parents using matched - pairs tests . To identify contrasting family proﬁles , a K - means cluster analysis was implemented . Results : Of 1 , 549 families contacted , 1 , 051 ( 68 % ) participated . Adolescents were less affected by possible COVID - 19 than their parents ( 138 . 7 vs . 192 . 7 per 1 , 00 , 000 person - days ) . Household transmission of possible COVID - 19 was higher when possible COVID - 19 came from adults than from adolescents . Most families implemented preventive measures . Adolescents and parents generally shared the same attitudes , but adolescents were less compliant with restrictive measures . Four family proﬁles were identiﬁed which differed mainly regarding family stress , COVID - 19 in the household , and compliance with preventive measures . Conclusion : Improving information dissemination to parents and adolescents , including dedicated adolescent messages , would increase adherence to preventive measures .

COVID - 19 Lockdown in PARIS Cohort INTRODUCTION After a cluster of pneumonia cases was reported in Wuhan , China , in December 2019 , coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) , caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) , was characterized by the World Health Organization as a pandemic on 03 / 11 / 2020 ( 1 ) . At this time , due to the high demand and shortage of reagents , many national health authorities had to reserve tests for people with severe symptoms of COVID - 19 or speciﬁc situations . Consequently , very few studies have been able to assess the prevalence or incidence of COVID - 19 in general population . One solution was to rely on symptoms of COVID - 19 ( 2 , 3 ) , or use SARS - CoV - 2 serological tests ( 4 ) . In France , there were studies in speciﬁc populations : in socially deprived neighborhoods ( 5 , 6 ) , suburban households ( 7 ) or in day - care centers ( 8 ) ; but few focused on adolescents and their families . Furthermore , the susceptibility of adolescents to SARS - CoV - 2 infection seems to be similar to adults to date ( 9 – 11 ) but the role of adolescents in the household transmission of the SARS - CoV - 2 during lockdown remains unclear . Some studies showed no diﬀerence in SARS - CoV - 2 transmission between children and adults in households ( 12 , 13 ) , while others showed a lower household transmission rate from children compared to adults ( 14 , 15 ) . To slow the spread of COVID - 19 , several countries successively opted for lockdown measures . In France , a lockdown procedure was implemented between 03 / 17 / 2020 and 05 / 10 / 2020 . This national lockdown included : closing public spaces , businesses , services , and schools ; restricting travel ( except for necessary food shopping , medical care , legal obligations , and work when telecommuting was not possible ) and limiting outside time to the vicinity of homes ( individual sports activity , dog hygiene ) . This unprecedented situation led to a sudden disruption in the daily lives of adolescents and their families . In order to assess the impact of these public health measures , it is important to better understand the perception and compliance with these measures . Studying the behaviors and attitudes of adolescents and their families is essential to a more accurate comprehension of the dynamics of transmission during the lockdown and the impact of these measures on adolescents . To our knowledge , no studies considered the overall experience of adolescents and their families in terms of morbidity , perception , behaviors , and attitudes during this exceptional event . Our aims were , i ) to describe the morbidity related to COVID - 19 in the families of the PARIS birth cohort ; ii ) to identify family proﬁles in terms of morbidity , perception , behaviors , and attitudes , during the COVID - 19 pandemic in France from 03 / 17 / 2020 to 05 / 10 / 2020 . METHODS Study Design and Participants This cross - sectional study was carried - out in the PARIS population - based birth cohort which is composed of healthy newborns living in the Paris area recruited between 2003 and 2006 in ﬁve Paris hospitals ( 16 ) . At the end of the ﬁrst lockdown in France , 1 , 549 families with an available email address were invited to participate in a speciﬁc survey based on both adolescent and parent online self - administered questionnaires . The present study deals with 1 , 051 families who answered at least one questionnaire ( adolescent and / or parents ) . The response rate was 68 % . The French Ethics Committees approved the PARIS cohort follow - up ( permission nos . 031153 , 051289 ; ID - RCB , 2009 - A00824 - 53 ) . Parents and adolescents gave their informed consent . Data Collection Data from online questionnaires included questions on socio - demographic , family , and home characteristics , reported COVID - 19 morbidity , perception , behaviors , and attitudes during the ﬁrst lockdown ( 03 / 17 / 2020 to 05 / 10 / 2020 ) . Reported COVID - 19 Morbidity and Household Transmission COVID - 19 morbidity was assessed for the adolescent , the responding parent , and all relatives in the same household during the lockdown . Families reported symptoms suggestive of COVID - 19 since the beginning of the year , date of onset and end of symptoms , potential close contact with a COVID - 19 - like symptoms case and / or a test - conﬁrmed COVID - 19 case in the 14 days prior to symptom onset , doctor - diagnosed COVID - 19 , test - conﬁrmed COVID - 19 , medical care , and medications . Possible COVID - 19 cases were deﬁned according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control as any person with at least one of the following symptoms : cough , fever , shortness of breath , anosmia , ageusia or dysgeusia ( 17 ) . Possible COVID - 19 cases or test - conﬁrmed COVID - 19 cases that occurred during the lockdown period between 03 / 17 / 2020 and 05 / 10 / 2020 inclusive , were identiﬁed within each household . Secondary cases were deﬁned as possible COVID - 19 cases that occurred between 2 to 14 days after a primary case from the same household . A household contact of a primary case was deﬁned as a family member or a close relative living in the same household during the full lockdown period who did not develop possible COVID - 19 or had test - conﬁrmed COVID - 19 before the primary case . Perception , Behaviors , and Attitudes Adolescents and parents assessed their levels of stress ( overall and SARS - CoV - 2 - related ) from the beginning of the lockdown on a 0 - to - 10 scale and their degree of satisfaction regarding the level of information received about SARS - CoV - 2 . Adolescents reported their degree of agreement with lockdown measures while their parents indicated adolescents’ tolerance of the lockdown ( 0 - to - 10 scale ) . Concerning changes in family behaviors during the lockdown , we collected adolescents’ and parents’ information on potential implementation and reinforcement of COVID - 19 preventive measures , as well as the frequencies per week of leaving the house for fresh air or shopping and the number of people they had met the previous day . Finally , the parent questionnaire explored the main reason why respondents changed their behavior during the lockdown . Questionnaires were pilot tested .

COVID - 19 Lockdown in PARIS Cohort Statistical Analysis The main characteristics of responding and non - responding families were compared using chi - squared tests . Family and home characteristics during the lockdown were described . Incidence rates of possible COVID - 19 were calculated for adolescents and parents during the lockdown ( from 03 / 17 / 2020 to 05 / 10 / 2020 inclusive ) . For each participant never having contracted a possible COVID - 19 before the start of the lockdown , the time - at - risk was calculated . This was the time from the ﬁrst day of the lockdown to : i ) the day when the ﬁrst symptoms were reported in possible COVID - 19 cases ; ii ) the last day of the lockdown or the day the questionnaire was ﬁlled in ( if before the end of the lockdown ) when no possible COVID - 19 was detected . The 95 % conﬁdence intervals ( CI ) were determined using the quadratic approximation to the Poisson log likelihood for the log - rate parameter . The observed clinical secondary attack rates ( SAR ) were estimated as the proportion of secondary cases among all household contacts and according to the age of the primary case . Among possible COVID - 19 cases , adolescents and parents were compared regarding symptoms , clinical characteristics and medical care using chi - squared , Fisher’s exact tests and Student’s t - tests . Within each family , perception , behaviors , and attitudes were compared between adolescents and parents using McNemar and Wilcoxon matched - pairs signed - rank tests . To identify contrasting family proﬁles during the lockdown , a K - means partitioning cluster analysis was implemented on 70 variables related to socio - demographics , family and home characteristics , COVID - 19 morbidity , perception , behaviors , and attitudes . Quantitative variables were standardized using Z - scores . The algorithm was performed over 10 , 000 iterations and repeatedly ﬁtted with 2 to 10 clusters . The optimal classiﬁcation was chosen based on Calinski - Harabasz criterion and relevance . To compare family proﬁles and detect the most discriminating variables , chi - squared , Fisher’s exact , and Kruskal - Wallis tests were realized with post - hoc Tukey’s HSD ( honestly signiﬁcant diﬀerence ) test . All analyses were performed on Stata / SE , using the complete - case method . RESULTS Participants Of the 1 , 549 families to whom questionnaires were sent , 866 adolescents ( 13 – 17 years old ) and 966 parents responded ( Supplementary Figure 1 ) . No diﬀerences were observed between participating and non - participating families for sex of the adolescent , place of residence at birth , parental socioeconomic status ( SES ) and presence of older siblings ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . Family and Home Characteristics Table 1 presents the family and home characteristics during the lockdown . Six percent of the adolescents spent most of the lockdown out of their main residence . The median number of persons in the household was four with a median area of 25 m 2 / person . At least one parent had an occupation deemed “essential” ( e . g . , health care , food manufacture and TABLE 1 | Family and home characteristics of the PARIS birth cohort during the lockdown . n ( % ) Lockdown in a city of more than 1 , 00 , 000 inhabitants , n ( % ) 355 ( 41 . 9 ) Adolescent place of residence most of the time Parents’ home only , n ( % ) 731 ( 85 . 6 ) Alternating homes ( separated parents ) , n ( % ) 73 ( 8 . 5 ) In a second home , n ( % ) 43 ( 5 . 0 ) Elsewhere , n ( % ) 8 ( 0 . 9 ) Number of children in the household ( including participants ) * 1 , n ( % ) 199 ( 24 . 0 ) 2 , n ( % ) 420 ( 50 . 7 ) 3 , n ( % ) 155 ( 18 . 7 ) 4 or more , n ( % ) 55 ( 6 . 6 ) Number of adults in the household ( including participants ) * 1 , n ( % ) 86 ( 10 . 4 ) 2 , n ( % ) 588 ( 70 . 9 ) 3 , n ( % ) 116 ( 14 . 0 ) 4 or more , n ( % ) 39 ( 4 . 7 ) Housing density < one person per room , n ( % ) 378 ( 45 . 7 ) One person per room , n ( % ) 295 ( 35 . 6 ) More than one person per room , n ( % ) 155 ( 18 . 7 ) Adolescent with a shared room , n ( % ) 135 ( 15 . 9 ) No garden , yard , terrace , or balcony to get fresh air , n ( % ) 120 ( 14 . 1 ) At least one parent working out of the home , n ( % ) 352 ( 37 . 1 ) * Maximum if several households . supply ) in 29 . 9 % of the families : 40 percent of this group were health professionals . Reported COVID - 19 Morbidity From 01 / 01 / 2020 to 05 / 10 / 2020 , there were 159 possible COVID - 19 cases in adolescents with no diﬀerence detected according to sex , age , body mass index and family SES . During lockdown , possible COVID - 19 was developed by 53 adolescents and 78 parents for 38 , 206 and 40 , 487 person - days - at - risk ( Table 2 ) . Concerning possible COVID - 19 cases , fewer adolescents suﬀered from fatigue and more presented rhinitis - like and gastrointestinal symptoms , compared with parents ( Table 3 ) . The median recovery time in adolescents and parents with possible COVID - 19 was 9 days ( ﬁrst - third quartile : 5 – 30 days ) and 16 days ( 7 – 31 days ) . Household Transmission During the lockdown , 422 possible COVID - 19 cases were identiﬁed in 291 households . The observed clinical SAR of possible COVID - 19 was 6 . 8 % ( 95 % CI : 5 . 2 , 8 . 6 ) among 900 household contacts . This was 4 . 3 % ( 95 % CI : 0 . 5 , 14 . 8 ) from children , 4 . 4 % ( 95 % CI : 2 . 2 , 7 . 7 ) Frontiers in Public Health | www . frontiersin . org 3 May 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 907456 Citerne et al .

Perception , Behaviors , and Attitudes Adolescents reported general and SARS - CoV - 2 - related stress levels lower than their parents ( p < 0 . 001 ) . Both adolescents and parents used the media as the primary information source regarding SARS - CoV - 2 ( 47 . 3 vs . 61 . 1 % , p < 0 . 001 ) . Adolescents were more likely to select social networks ( 11 . 4 vs . 2 . 0 % , p < 0 . 001 ) or their relatives and friends ( 22 . 5 vs . 0 . 8 % , p < 0 . 001 ) as primary source of information . Adolescents were fewer to be satisﬁed with their level of information about the SARS - CoV - 2 than their parents ( 60 . 0 vs . 66 . 5 % , p = 0 . 006 ) . They tended to be less often satisﬁed with their level of information when using social networks as their primary source of information ( 53 . 1 % satisﬁed using social networks , 61 . 4 % using other sources of information , p = 0 . 12 ) . Concerning behaviors over the whole lockdown , 96 . 0 % of the adolescents implemented or reinforced at least one preventive measure . The preventive measures most frequently cited by adolescents were cleaning hands ( 79 . 8 % ) , avoiding kissing and / or hugging ( 76 . 6 % ) , avoiding shaking hands ( 74 . 8 % ) and avoiding going outside ( 73 . 7 % ) . Compared with their parents , adolescents generally applied signiﬁcantly fewer preventive measures ( Figure 1 ) .

COVID - 19 Lockdown in PARIS Cohort FIGURE 1 | Implementation and reinforcement of COVID - 19 preventive measures for adolescents and their parents in the PARIS birth cohort during lockdown . Family Proﬁles A total of 589 families were included in the cluster analysis . Four family proﬁles were identiﬁed . Variables that most distinguished each cluster from another were adolescents’ and parents’ SARS - CoV - 2 - related stress levels and overall stress levels , adolescents’ tolerance of the lockdown according to the parent , frequency at which the parent left the house for shopping and the number of people the parent had met the previous day ( Table 4 and Supplementary Tables 3 – 7 ) . Cluster 1 ( 23 % of participants ) adolescents and parents experienced SARS - CoV - 2 - related stress , with parents reporting leaving the house for shopping less often than other clusters and meeting fewer people the previous day . Cluster 1 families were less likely to live in a city of more than 1 , 00 , 000 inhabitants and were less aﬀected by possible COVID - 19 ( 13 . 4 % of the adolescents ) . Cluster 2 ( 24 % of participants ) adolescents and parents reported the most SARS - CoV - 2 - related stress . Parents in Cluster 2 left the house for shopping less often and often applied more extensive preventive measures : cleaning the bathroom after each use , showering , and changing clothes when they arrived home , disinfecting everyday objects and disinfecting door handles . This was the cluster most aﬀected by possible COVID - 19 ( 23 . 6 % of the adolescents ) . The largest group was Cluster 3 ( 35 % of participants ) . Compared to the families from the other clusters , both parents and adolescents showed the least stress and were the least compliant regarding preventive measures . Parents left the house for shopping more frequently . Adolescents saw more people face - to - face and their tolerance of lockdown was the best of all the clusters . The prevalence of possible COVID - 19 in Cluster 3 adolescents was 15 . 3 % . Cluster 4 ( 18 % of participants ) adolescents and parents had an overall stress level higher than SARS - CoV - 2 - related stress level . Families lived more frequently in a city of more than 100 , 000 inhabitants . Parents were more likely to work outside the home during the lockdown ( 47 . 2 % ) and to leave the house for shopping . Adolescents were less likely to stay at their parents’ home for the duration of the lockdown . The prevalence of possible COVID - 19 in adolescents in Cluster 4 was 21 . 7 % . DISCUSSION Key Results PARIS adolescents were less aﬀected by possible COVID - 19 at the end of the ﬁrst lockdown than their parents .

Most adolescents and parents implemented prevention measures . Nevertheless , adolescents respected these measures less than their parents . Four family proﬁles were identiﬁed . The main factors diﬀerentiating these proﬁles were stress , particularly parental stress , and compliance with preventive measures . This study showed that compliance with preventive measures was strongly related to family stress and COVID - 19 morbidity . Reported COVID - 19 Morbidity In this study , adolescents were less aﬀected by COVID - 19 than their parents . Only the EpiCov study looked at the seroprevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 in adolescents in France during the lockdown with a seroprevalence lower in adolescents ( 3 . 6 % ) than in the general population ( 4 . 5 % ) ( 18 ) . Nevertheless , the prevalence of possible COVID - 19 probably led to overestimation of the real prevalence of COVID - 19 . Our study showed that only 0 . 2 % of the adolescents had test - conﬁrmed COVID - 19 . This low proportion could be largely explained by the limited access to virological testing during this period . Regarding the clinical manifestations of possible COVID - 19 in PARIS teenagers , symptoms were similar to those presented in children studies ( 19 , 20 ) . Adolescents were more likely to develop mild symptoms such as rhinitis - like symptoms and headache . In contrast , parents appeared to develop more severe COVID - 19 than adolescents : fatigue symptoms were more frequent , and the duration of symptoms was longer . These results are consistent with previous published ﬁndings showing a correlation between age and severity ( 21 , 22 ) . Adolescents suﬀered from gastrointestinal symptoms more frequently than parents , which has been shown in children ( 23 – 25 ) . The household observed clinical SAR of possible COVID - 19 ( 6 . 8 % ) was lower than the test - conﬁrmed COVID - 19 pooled SAR observed in Thompson et al . ( 21 . 1 % ) and Madewell et al . ( 16 . 6 % ) meta - analysis ( 26 , 27 ) . However , they included few European studies and showed a great heterogeneity of household SAR ( 0 to 51 % ) due to diﬀerent durations of exposure and diﬀerent testing strategies . The lower SAR observed in our study could be a result of the possible overestimation of primary cases and thus an underestimation of household transmission . However , transmission was lower from adolescents than from adults , which has been previously observed in children but not speciﬁcally in adolescents ( 14 , 26 , 27 ) . The reasons why adolescents were less aﬀected by COVID - 19 than adults could be explained by a greater exposure to SARS - CoV - 2 in adults than in adolescents due to the need to go out for shopping or work . Moreover , because the viral load is lower and clearance is faster in the milder COVID - 19 , this would help explain why transmission from adolescents was lower than from adults ( 28 ) . Perception , Behaviors , and Attitudes PARIS adolescents had a lower stress level than their parents . This may be due to lower exposure of adolescents to pandemic - related stress . During the lockdown , adolescents were educated at home while parents had additional role demands that could cause psychological stress ( 29 ) . Despite this , adolescents were less satisﬁed with their level of received information about the SARS - CoV - 2 than their parents . Adolescents’ use of social networks compared with their parents could explain this lower level of satisfaction . Indeed , adolescents using social networks as their primary source of information were less often satisﬁed with it . It has been shown that adolescents are often suspicious of health information from the Internet , but still use it ( 30 ) . This study found that adolescents were less compliant with preventive measures than their parents . Adolescents could have felt less concerned about the pandemic than their parents . However , PARIS families generally complied with preventive measures . These results agree with the EPIDEMIC project based on adults of the French population ( 31 ) . Overall , adolescents tolerated the lockdown well , which could be due to their living conditions related to high SES . Family Proﬁles Clusters revealed the importance of stress and compliance with lockdown measures in diﬀerentiating families . Adolescents generally reported attitudes towards lockdown measures similar to their parents , even if they were less compliant . This could be explained by parental practices and parental coping ( 32 ) . Furthermore , a probable association between stress , COVID - 19 , and preventive measures has been pointed out . Cluster 2 reported the higher stress level , was the most aﬀected by COVID - 19 and strongly respected preventive measures . Conversely , Cluster 3 reported the lower stress level , was the least aﬀected by COVID - 19 , and was the least compliant with preventive measures . It has been shown that having had COVID - 19 may increase compliance with preventive measures ( 33 ) . Regarding stress levels , fears of infecting others or oneself may increase compliance with preventive measures ( 34 ) . In Cluster 1 , families were relatively stressed but less aﬀected by COVID - 19 . They lived less frequently in a large city . Cluster 4 families were stressed but not speciﬁcally by SARS - CoV - 2 . They more often lived in a large city and had one parent working outside the home . The economic or job - related situation of these families may have been an important source of stress . Strengths and Limitations It is one of the ﬁrst studies to consider the complementary views of both adolescents and parents . The use of two simultaneous self - administered questionnaires made it possible to compare morbidity , perception , behaviors and attitudes of adolescents and parents and to collect a large variety of information . The comparison of COVID - 19 morbidity between children and adults has been studied , but rarely in adolescents . This study is innovative in comparing perception , behaviors and attitudes between adolescents and their parents . The use of online questionnaires at the end of the lockdown made it possible to cover the entire duration of the lockdown . Finally , the participation rate was satisfactory and remains comparable to other studies ( 2 , 35 ) . The main limitation is the lack of virological conﬁrmation Frontiers in Public Health | www . frontiersin . org 7 May 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 907456 Citerne et al . COVID - 19 Lockdown in PARIS Cohort of possible COVID - 19 and the risk its misclassiﬁcation . Moreover , we cannot exclude a recall bias despite the strong awareness , especially via media . Lastly , this study focuses on a speciﬁc population . The Parisian families being of a high SES , these ﬁndings cannot be generalized to all French families . CONCLUSION COVID - 19 morbidity , stress and preventive measures were inter - related within families during the lockdown . Adolescents and their parents presented similar attitudes towards lockdown measures , even if adolescents were less compliant . This study underscores that media and relatives are a key prevention medium to focus on when informing adolescents . Improving information dissemination to adolescents and parents , including dedicated adolescent messages , would increase adherence to preventive measures .
