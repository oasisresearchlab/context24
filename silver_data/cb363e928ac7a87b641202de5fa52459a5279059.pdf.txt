However , the mechanisms involved in macrophage migration through intersti - tial tissues are poorly understood . We investigated the role of Hck , a Src - family kinase involved in the organization of matrix adhesion and degradation struc - tures called podosomes . In Hck (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice submitted to peritonitis , we found that macrophages accumulated in interstitial tissues and barely reached the peritoneal cavity . In vitro , 3 - dimensional ( 3D ) migra - tion and matrix degradation abilities , 2 protease - dependent properties of bone marrow – derived macrophages ( BMDMs ) , were affected in Hck (cid:1) / (cid:1) BMDMs . These macrophages formed few and undersized podosome rosettes and , consequently , had reduced matrix proteolysis operating underneath despite normal expression and activity of matrix metalloproteases . Finally , in ﬁbroblasts unable to inﬁltrate matrix , ectopic expression of Hck pro - vided the gain – of – 3D migration function , which correlated positively with forma - tion of podosome rosettes . In conclusion , spatial organization of podosomes as large rosettes , proteolytic degradation of extracellular matrix , and 3D migration ap - peared to be functionally linked and regu - lated by Hck in macrophages . Hck , as the ﬁrst protein combining a phagocyte - limited expression with a role in 3D migra - tion , could be a target for new anti - inﬂammatory and antitumor molecules . ( Blood . 2010 ; 115 : 1444 - 1452 ) Introduction Phagocytes constitute the ﬁrst line of host defense against microorganisms . 1 , 2 To reach an infectious site , they transmigrate through the endothelial wall , basal membranes , and connective tissues and inﬁltrate the damaged organ to affect host defense and tissue repair . 3 Nevertheless , phagocytes have not only friend but also foe functions . 4 , 5 In several pathologic states , including chronic inﬂammatory 6 , 7 and neurodegenerative diseases 8 or atherosclerosis , 9 - 11 phagocyte - dependent tissue lesions often occur . In addition , it has been established that the presence of macrophages within tumors is a sign of a poor prognosis as they enhance angiogenesis and metastases ( see Mantovani et al 12 ; Condeelis and Pollard 13 ; and Balkwill et al 14 for reviews ) . In contrast , T - cell inﬁltration into tumors is often associated with a more positive prognosis . 15 Therefore it is becoming a challenge to speciﬁcally control tissue inﬁltration of macrophages without affecting lymphocyte migration . By targeting macrophage migra - tion - related molecules , new anti - inﬂammatory and antitumor - based drugs could be developed . 16 , 17 However , the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in macrophage migration are poorly understood . Phagocyte migration has been studied mostly in vitro in 2 dimensions ( 2D ) in response to chemotactic factors . In these experiments , cells are plated on either plastic or glass coverslips , coated or not with matrix proteins . However , in vivo , phagocyte transendothelial migration and inﬁltration through tissue involve primarily 3 - dimensional ( 3D ) regulation . Transendothelial migra - tion proceeds through either a paracellular or a transcellular route involving several types of adhesion proteins and signaling path - ways ( for a review see , Ley et al 3 ) . In contrast , the mechanisms underlying phagocyte migration in 3D through connective tissue are poorly understood . The available data on cell migration mechanisms through extracellular matrices have been obtained mostly with invasive tumor cells . Depending on the cell line and the extracellular matrix studied , tumor cells perform a protease - dependent and / or - independent transmatrix migration . 18 - 20 In the absence of proteolytic matrix remodeling , the migration of tumor cells depends on their ability to glide and squeeze through gaps and trails present in connective tissues . The few 3D - migration studies performed on lymphocytes and dendritic cells suggest that these cells migrate in a proteolytic - and integrin - independent fashion . 21 , 22 Transmatrix migration of the macrophage cell line U937 also proceeds through a nonproteolytic and round - shape migration mechanism , 20 however the relevance of these cells to primary macrophages or tumor cells is unclear .

Src - family protein tyrosine kinases are involved in the invasive capacity of tumor cells . 24 , 25 The Src - family protein tyrosine ki - nases , which are expressed predominantly in myeloid leukocytes , Hck , Fgr , and Lyn , regulate phagocyte migration and degranulation as described mostly using double and triple knockout mice . 26 However , the speciﬁc roles of each kinase have not yet been elucidated . Hck is expressed as 2 isoforms , 27 p59Hck is associated with the plasma membrane where it triggers the formation of protrusions , 28 , 29 and p61Hck is associated with the membrane of lysosomes that contribute to the formation of podosome ro - settes . 28 , 30 Interestingly , podosomes are adhesion structures with proteolytic properties toward the extracellular matrix 31 , 32 that are constitutively present in monocyte - derived cells . In contrast , neutrophils do not exhibit regular podosomes . 33 Although the precise function of these actin - rich structures is not yet established , that of invadopodia , which are podosome - like structures present in tumor cells , has been implicated in cancer cell invasion and metastasis . 34 In the present work , we examined the speciﬁc role played by Hck in macrophage 3D migration , as this kinase presents the advantage to be speciﬁcally expressed in phagocytes and thereby constitutes a potential target for pharmacologic blockade of macrophage migration . We report that Hck (cid:1) / (cid:1) macrophages form fewer podosome rosettes and have impaired ability to degrade ECM , resulting in altered trans - matrix migration in vitro and tissue invasion in vivo . Methods Mice C57Bl6 / J wild - type mice were purchased from Charles River Inc . Hck (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice , backcrossed onto the C57Bl6 / J background , were previously charac - terized . 35 All experiments were performed according to animal protocols approved by the Animal Care and Use committee of the Institut de Pharmacologie et de Biologie Structurale . Peritoneal inﬂammation model Peritoneal injections of 0 . 5 mL of thioglycolate 4 % Brewer ( Sigma ) or saline buffer were performed in 6 - to 12 - week - old female mice . Twenty - four or 72 hours after injection , abdominal cavities were washed . Cytospin slides with peritoneal cells were stained with May - Gru¨nwald / Giemsa ( RAL ) and neutrophils and macrophages were counted . Histologic analysis Tissue samples from anterior abdominal wall omentum from wild - type ( wt ) and Hck (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice were taken , ﬁxed in 10 % buffered formalin solution ( Sigma ) , embedded in parafﬁn , and prepared for immunohistochemistry as detailed in supplemental Methods ( available on the Blood website ; see the Supplemental Materials link at the top of the online article ) . Isolation and culture of BMDMs Bone marrow cells were isolated from femurs and tibias and cultured ( 1 . 3 (cid:2) 10 7 / dish ; Bioscience Inc ) in complete medium ( RPMI 1640 / 10 % fetal calf serum [ FCS ] / 1 % L - glutamine ; Invitrogen ) containing 20 ng / mL recombinant murine macrophage colony - stimulating factor ( rmM - CSF ; Immunotools ) . After 7 days , adherent bone marrow – derived macrophages ( BMDMs ) were harvested with 5 mL of phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) / 10mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( pH 7 . 4 ) , resuspended in RPMI 1640 containing 1 % FCS , 1 % L - glutamine , and 10 ng / mL rmM - CSF , and counted . Immunoblot analysis Total cell lysates from wt and Hck (cid:1) / (cid:1) BMDMs were subjected to immunoblot analysis as described in supplemental Methods . Fluorescence - activated cell sorting analysis BMDMs ( 1 (cid:2) 10 6 ) were incubated with F4 / 80 antibody ( clone CI : A3 - 1 , 1 : 100 ; AbD Serotec ) in PBS / 1 % FCS for 1 hour at 4°C , washed , and incubated with secondary ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) – conjugated goat anti – rat antibody ( Cedarlane CLCC 40401 ) or directly labeled with FITC - conjugated anti – mouse CD11b antibody ( Immunotools ) . Cells were washed twice and analyzed with a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur using the CellQuestPro software . Background staining was assessed by omitting the primary antibody . M1 / M2 transcriptional proﬁle of BMDMs RNA was extracted from wt and Hck (cid:1) / (cid:1) BMDMs using QIAGEN kit and treated with RNase - free DNase ( QIAGEN ) . The reverse transcription ( Superscript II ; Invitrogen ) of 10 ng of RNA was performed with an oligo ( dT ) primer . The primers for tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) , interleukin - 12p40 ( IL - 12p40 ) , inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS ) , transforming growth factor - (cid:3) 1 ( TGF - (cid:3) 1 ) , mannose receptor ( MR ) , arginase , Ym1 / 2 , and (cid:3) - actin were designed using the primer3 tool available at the following website : http : / / frodo . wi . mit . edu / primer3 as previously described . 36 , 37 Re - verse transcriptase was omitted in negative controls . The fold change in target gene cDNA relative to the (cid:3) - actin endogenous control was deter - mined with the following formulas : fold change (cid:4) 2 (cid:1)(cid:5)(cid:5) Ct , where (cid:5)(cid:5) Ct (cid:4) ( Ct Target (cid:1) Ct Actin ) stimulated (cid:1) ( Ct Target (cid:1) Ct Actin ) unstimulated . Ct values were deﬁned as the cycle numbers at which the ﬂuorescence signals were detected 38 Tet - Off MEF - 3T3 cell lines Constitutively active ( Hck Y501F or Hck ca ) mutants stably expressed in mouse embryonic ﬁbroblast 3T3 ( MEF - 3T3 ) Tet - Off cells ( Clontech ) have been previously described . 30 , 39 The clones used in this study expressed p59Hck ca – green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) or p61Hck ca - GFP or p59 Hck ca - GFP and p61Hck ca - GFP clones A and B . These cells optimally expressed Hck constructs after 7 days in doxycycline - free culture medium . Hck - negative MEF - 3T3 Tet - Off ( parental mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts [ MEFs ] ) were used as a negative control . Immunoﬂuorescence microscopy BMDMs ( 1 . 5 (cid:2) 10 5 ) were seeded on ﬁbronectin - coated coverslips ( 10 (cid:6) g / mL ; Sigma ) for 24 hours . Cells were ﬁxed with paraformaldehyde ( 3 . 7 % ; Sigma ) , permeabilized with Triton X - 100 ( 0 . 1 % ; Sigma ) , as previously described , 29 , 30 and stained with antivinculin antibody ( clone HVin - 1 , dilution 1 / 300 ; Sigma ) followed by FITC - conjugated goat anti – mouse immunoglobulin G ( 1 / 500 ; Coger ) and Texas red – coupled phalloidin ( Molecular Probes , Invitrogen ) . For labeling of cell surface matrix metallo - protease 2 ( MMP2 ) and membrane type 1 matrix metalloprotease ( MT1 - MMP ) , cells were incubated on ice for 30 minutes with anti - MMP2 ( clone VB3 , 1 / 100 ; Calbiochem ) or MT1 - MMP ( 1 / 100 ; from Marie Christine Rio , IGBMC , Illkirch , France ) monoclonal antibodies in PBS containing 10 % FCS before ﬁxation . Antibodies were detected with Alexa546 - conjugated goat antibodies ( Molecular Probes ) . MEF - 3T3 cells ( 7 (cid:2) 10 3 ) were allowed to adhere on glass coverslips , ﬁxed , permeabilized , and stained as previ - ously described . 30 Slides were visualized with a Leica DM - RB ﬂuorescence microscope . Matrix degradation assay Coverslips were coated with 0 . 2 mg / mL FITC coupled - gelatin ( Molecular Probes ) as previously described . 30 BMDMs ( 1 . 5 (cid:2) 10 5 ) were cultured for 24 hours on gelatin - FITC , ﬁxed , processed for F - actin staining , and MACROPHAGE 3D MIGRATION INVOLVES Hck 1445 BLOOD , 18 FEBRUARY 2010 (cid:1) VOLUME 115 , NUMBER 7 For personal use only . on April 22 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From observed as described above . Quantiﬁcation of matrix degradation was assessed by measuring the pixels of total cell surface and the pixels of gelatin - FITC degradation area using Adobe Photoshop software ( Adobe Systems ) . The percentage of degradation corresponds to the number of pixels of degradation for 100 pixels of cell surface . Areas corresponding to 100 cells were quantiﬁed for each condition in 7 separated experiments . LysoTracker loading BMDMs cultured on gelatin - FITC were incubated with the acidotropic dye LysoTracker Red DND - 99 ( 1 : 1000 ; Molecular Probes ) in RPMI 1640 for 30 minutes . Cells were ﬁxed with 3 . 7 % paraformaldehyde for 30 minutes and F - actin stained with Alexa350 - coupled phalloidin ( Molecular Probes ) . 3D - migration assays Transwell assays . Migration assays were performed in 24 - transwells Matrigel Invasion Chambers ( 8 - (cid:6) m pores ; BD Biosciences ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Brieﬂy , MEF3T3 cells were starved overnight and 2 . 5 (cid:2) 10 4 cells seeded in the upper chambers . The lower chamber was ﬁlled with 750 (cid:6) L of Dulbecco modiﬁed Eagle medium containing 10 % FCS , 1 % glutamine . After 24 hours , cells in the upper chamber were discarded and migrated cells were counted . Experiments were performed in triplicates with 2 independent clones of each Hck construct . BMDMs were starved for 3 hours . Lower and upper chambers were ﬁlled with RPMI 1640 containing 10 % FCS and 50 ng / mL rmM - CSF or 1 % FCS and 10 ng / mL rmM - CSF , respectively . For homemade Matrigel assays , 100 (cid:6) L of 9 . 3 mg / mL Matrigel ( BD Biosciences ) was poured in 24 trans - wells ( 8 - (cid:6) m pores ) , polymerized for 30 minutes at 37°C , and rehydrated for 3 hours with RPMI 1640 medium ; the Matrigel matrix thickness was measured with MetaMorph software ( Molecular Devices ) after setting of the top and the bottom of the matrix : 1 . 72 ( (cid:7) 0 . 05 mm ; n (cid:4) 3 ) . BMDMs ( 5 (cid:2) 10 4 ) were seeded in the upper chamber and after 24 hours of migration z - series of images were acquired at the surface of the Matrigel and at several depths ( until 400 (cid:6) m , 30 - (cid:6) m intervals ) into the matrix . Cell migration was measured by dividing the number of cells that invaded the Matrigel matrix by the total cell number . In some experiments , a cocktail of protease inhibitors consisting of 0 . 1 (cid:6) M aprotinin ( Sigma ) , 0 . 1 (cid:6) M pepsta - tin A ( Sigma ) , 0 . 1 (cid:6) M leupeptin ( Sigma ) , 5 (cid:6) M E - 64c ( Peptides Interna - tional ) , 0 . 25 (cid:6) M GM6001 ( Calbiochem ) 20 was added in the upper and the lower chambers . Vehicle was loaded as a control . The cell viability was assessed by quantiﬁcation of trypan blue exclusion . 3D - random migration analysis . BMDMs ( 10 5 ) suspended in 100 (cid:6) L of Matrigel at 4°C were plated on glass - based dishes , polymerized for 30 minutes at 37°C , and incubated with RPMI 1640 containing 10 % FCS , 1 % L - glutamine , and 50 ng / mL rmM - CSF . During recording , cells were kept at 37°C in 5 % CO 2 atmosphere . 3D migration was recorded with the 20 (cid:2) objective of an automated Leica DMIRBE microscope equipped with a CoolSnapEz Camera ( Roper Scientiﬁc ) for 10 hours . Z stacks were acquired every 3 minutes between 400 and 700 (cid:6) m above the glass surface . Migrating cells were tracked from projected stacks to analyze velocity and persistence over time with MetaMorph 6 software . 2D migration assays Scraped area replenishment assay . A conﬂuent monolayer of BMDMs was scraped with a small cell scraper . Replenishment of the scraped area was quantiﬁed after 3 . 5 and 7 hours of culture with ImageJ software ( National Institutes of Health ) . Transwell assay . Uncoated - 8 (cid:6) m porous transwells ( BD Biosciences ) and ﬁbronectin - coated transwells were used . Cells were serum starved for 3 hours and the migration assay was carried out for 6 hours . Lower and upper chambers were ﬁlled and cell migration quantiﬁed as described for transwell 3D - migration assay . Random migration analysis . BMDMs were seeded on glass - based dishes ( Labtek , Fisher Scientiﬁc ) or Matrigel ( diluted 1 / 30 in RPMI ) – coated glass dishes in complete medium supplemented by 10 ng / mL rmM - CSF . Two - dimensional ( 2D ) migration was recorded every 5 minutes during 5 hours with the 20 (cid:2) objective of an automated Leica DMIRBE microscope equipped with a CoolSnapEz camera ( Roper Scientiﬁc ) . Cells were tracked using MetaMorph 6 software for velocity analysis . Scanning electron microscopy Scanning electron microscopy observations of BMDMs on Matrigel matrix were performed as previously described 40 ; see supplemental Methods for details . Gelatin zymography wt and Hck (cid:1) / (cid:1) BMDMs were cultured overnight on ﬁbronectin ; cell extracts and supernatants were subjected to zymography assay as detailed in supplemental Methods . Statistics All data in the text and ﬁgures are expressed as mean ( (cid:7) SEM ) and 2 - way analysis of variance statistical analyses were carried out with SigmaStat 3 . 5 software ( Systat Software ) . A P value of less than . 05 was considered signiﬁcant ( * P (cid:8) . 05 , * * P (cid:8) . 01 , * * * P (cid:8) . 001 ) . Results Hck deﬁciency results in a defect of phagocyte recruitment in the peritoneal cavity The effect of Hck deﬁciency on leukocyte migration was evaluated in a peritonitis model induced by an intraperitoneal injection of the inﬂammatory agent thioglycollate . 41 At 24 and 72 hours after thioglycolate injection , the recruitment of inﬂammatory cells into the peritoneal cavity of Hck (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice was signiﬁcantly reduced compared with wt littermates ( Figure 1A ) . Macrophage and neutrophil inﬁltration into the peritoneal cavity were affected in Hck (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice at 24 and 72 hours ( Figure 1B ) . We also noticed that the number of resident macrophages in the peritoneum was lower in Hck (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice ( Hck (cid:1) / (cid:1) : 0 . 67 (cid:2) 10 6 (cid:7) 0 . 13 ) compared with wt ( 1 . 16 (cid:2) 10 6 (cid:7) 0 . 15 ; n (cid:4) 5 ; P (cid:4) . 001 ) . To further examine this point , bronchoalveolar lavages that consisted mostly of resident macrophages ( (cid:9) 94 % ) were performed . Com - pared with wt mice , the total cell number in bronchoalveolar lavages was decreased by 52 % in Hck (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice ( wt : 8 . 6 (cid:2) 10 4 (cid:7) 0 . 9 vs Hck (cid:1) / (cid:1) : 4 . 1 (cid:2) 10 4 (cid:7) 0 . 96 ; n (cid:4) 3 ; P (cid:4) . 006 ) . The mechanisms by which Hck deﬁciency could decrease phagocyte recruitment into the peritoneal cavity were examined . First , Hck deﬁciency may inhibit the production of circulating phagocytes . However , as previously reported , 42 we found that peripheral blood white cell counts including monocyte , neutrophil , and lymphocyte of 8 - to 12 - week - old wt and Hck (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice were similar ( data not shown ) , indicating that reduced phagocyte recruitment is not the result of impaired hematopoiesis . Second , a possible defect in transconnective tissue migration was examined . The peritoneal omentum was harvested from the 2 genotypes in physiologic and inﬂammatory conditions and immunohistochemi - cally stained to distinguish macrophages and neutrophils ( Figure 1C and data not shown ) . At 72 hours after thioglycollate injection , the number of macrophages that accumulated in the peritoneal tissue was signiﬁcantly higher in Hck (cid:1) / (cid:1) compared with wt mice and neutrophils are still present ( Figure 1D ) . Collagen distribution and content in the peritoneal tissue of wt and Hck (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice were similar and not altered by thioglycollate stimulation as detected by Masson trichrome staining ( data not shown ) . Third , endothelial transmigration of leukocytes was examined in vivo as described . 43 A diapedesis defect is characterized by accumulation of leukocytes 1446 COUGOULE et al BLOOD , 18 FEBRUARY 2010 (cid:1) VOLUME 115 , NUMBER 7 For personal use only . on April 22 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From on the endothelial surface of vessels , but as shown in supplemental Figure 1 , leukocytes were not adhering on the vascular endothe - lium in the 2 genotypes ( wt : 2 . 17 (cid:7) 3 . 4 vs Hck (cid:1) / (cid:1) : 1 . 35 (cid:7) 2 . 3 leukocytes / 10 (cid:1) 3 mm 2 of vessel section , P (cid:4) . 41 ) . Therefore , the defective recruitment of Hck (cid:1) / (cid:1) macrophages in the peritoneal cavity does not result from defective transendothelial migration , supporting a previous report showing that vascular extravasation is functional in Hck (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice . 44 These results indicate that Hck (cid:1) / (cid:1) macrophages , which accumu - late in tissue in inﬂammatory conditions but do not inﬁltrate the peritoneal cavity , are defective for migration from the connective tissue matrix into the peritoneal cavity . Defective 3D but not 2D migration in Hck (cid:1) / (cid:1) macrophages To examine whether altered in vivo recruitment of phagocytes reﬂects a defect in cell migration , we examined the transmatrix migration capacity of bone marrow – derived macrophages ( BM - DMs ) from wt and Hck (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice . First , we controlled that identical populations of BMDMs were obtained from the 2 genotypes using standard 2 - parameter forward / side scatter ( FSC / SSC ) ﬂow cytomet - ric analysis ( Figure 2A ) and that they expressed the 2 macrophage markers CD11b and F4 / 80 at the same level ( Figure 2A ) . Because the expression of these markers is known to increase progressively during in vitro BMDM differentiation , 45 these results indicate that Hck (cid:1) / (cid:1) cells reach the same maturation stage as wt cells . Because a bias in M1 / M2 differentiation has been recently described in macrophages from double Lyn and Hck knockout mice , 46 a combination of biomarkers was used to deﬁne macro - phage polarization . The M1 pattern is characterized by the expres - sion of iNOS , inﬂammatory cytokines and chemokines such as IL - 12 and TNF , whereas the M2 proﬁle , by arginase , MR , TGF (cid:3) - 1 , and Ym1 / 2 . 38 Comparing BMDMs from wt or Hck (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice , the Figure 1 .

MACROPHAGE 3D MIGRATION INVOLVES Hck 1447 BLOOD , 18 FEBRUARY 2010 (cid:1) VOLUME 115 , NUMBER 7 For personal use only . on April 22 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From expression of the different markers tested was not signiﬁcantly modulated ( Figure 2B ) . To examine the 3D - migration capacity of Hck (cid:1) / (cid:1) BMDMs , transwells coated with Matrigel , an extracellular matrix containing a heterogeneous mixture of proteins produced by a mouse sarcoma cell line grown in vivo , were used . Transwells are separated by a membrane with 8 - (cid:6) m pores occluded by a thin layer of Matrigel . Compared with wt BMDMs , the number of Hck (cid:1) / (cid:1) BMDMs in the lower side of the chamber was signiﬁcantly decreased ( Figure 2C ) . We observed no signiﬁcant morphologic differences between wt and Hck (cid:1) / (cid:1) BMDMs during spreading on Matrigel or puriﬁed ECM proteins ( ﬁbronectin , ﬁbrinogen , or gelatin ; data not shown ) , supporting previous observations 47 and suggesting that defective 3D migration was not the result of altered cell spreading . Next , we tested the 3D - migration capacity of BMDMs in a high Matrigel density ( 30 - fold more concentrated than the commercial preparation ) layered in transwells to form a thick layer of matrix ( (cid:9) 1 . 5 mm ) . Our objective was to test whether the migration defect of Hck (cid:1) / (cid:1) BMDMs could be enhanced in Matrigel with a higher density , to observe the cell morphology and to measure the cell migration velocity inside the matrix . After 24 hours , z - series of images from the top of the Matrigel layer to the bottom were collected ( supplemental Video 1 ) and cells were counted . The number of Matrigel - inﬁltrated Hck (cid:1) / (cid:1) BMDMs was signiﬁcantly reduced by 40 % compared with wt BMDMs ( Figure 2D ) to a similar extent as commercial Matrigel ( Figure 2C ) , indicating that trans - matrix migration was not further affected in a high - density matrix . When wt and Hck (cid:1) / (cid:1) cells were examined inside Matrigel by time - lapse microscopy , they exhibited a very similar morphology with an elongated cell shape and plasma membrane protrusions ( supplemental Video 2 ) . Moreover , we found that the 3D - migration velocity was signiﬁcantly reduced in Hck (cid:1) / (cid:1) BMDMs ( 0 . 316 (cid:7) 0 . 015 (cid:6) m / minute ) compared with wt cells ( 0 . 405 (cid:7) 0 . 014 (cid:6) m / minute ; P (cid:8) . 001 ) . In conclusion , fewer Hck (cid:1) / (cid:1) BMDMs are entering into Matrigel , and those that do migrate more slowly than wt cells . The 2D - migration capacity of BMDMs was also examined using scraped area replenishment assay and migration on ﬁbronec - tin - coated or uncoated transwells . The ability of wt and mutant macrophages to replenish the scraped area ( Figure 2E ) and to migrate on ﬁbronectin - coated or uncoated transwells ( Figure 2F ) were similar . We also observed no signiﬁcant difference with 2D velocities of macrophages migrating randomly on uncoated ( wt : 1 . 30 (cid:7) 0 . 06 (cid:6) m / minute ; Hck (cid:1) / (cid:1) macrophages : 1 . 45 (cid:7) 0 . 07 (cid:6) m / minute ) or Matrigel - coated ( wt : 0 . 643 (cid:7) 0 . 02 ; Hck (cid:1) / (cid:1) : 0 . 83 (cid:7) 0 . 02 (cid:6) m / minute ) glass coverslips . These results indicate that the 3D - migration capacity of Hck (cid:1) / (cid:1) macrophages is de - creased , whereas the 2D migration is not affected . Cooperation of Hck isoforms is required for cell transmatrix migration As Hck appeared to be involved in 3D - migration , gain - of - function experiments were designed to examine whether Hck expression is sufﬁcient to provide a 3D - migration capacity to cells that do not naturally express Hck and do not migrate inside matrix . MEF - 3T3 Tet - Off cells were stably and conditionally ( Tet - Off ) transfected with constitutively active variants of Hck ( Hck ca ) in fusion with GFP . 30 , 39 , 48 Cell clones were chosen on 2 criteria : Hck expression level quantitatively comparable with phagocytes and characteristic Hck phenotypes , membrane protrusions , and podosome rosettes ( supplemental Figure 3 ) . 29 , 30 Compared with parental MEF - 3T3 cells , cells coexpressing the 2 Hck isoforms acquired the ability to migrate through Matrigel ( Figure 3A ) , whereas their 2D - migration capacity was not modiﬁed ( parental MEFs : 0 . 59 (cid:7) 0 . 03 , MEF - p59 / p61Hck ca : 0 . 67 (cid:7) 0 . 02 (cid:6) m / minute ; mean of 122 cells (cid:7) SD and 183 cells , respectively ) . Next , we examined the respective role of each isoform in the 3D - migration experiments . Again , cell clones were chosen on characteristic Hck phenotypes , membrane protru - sions for p59Hck ca - or podosome rosettes for p61Hck ca - expressing cells ( Poincloux et al 48 and supplemental Figure 3 ) . Neither MEF - p59Hck ca nor MEF - p61Hck ca entered into the matrix ( Figure 3A ) . Invadopodia , the tumoral cell counterpart of podosomes , are involved in ECM degradation and probably in tissue invasion . 31 , 34 Interestingly , we noticed that MEF - p59 / p61Hck ca cells reaching the lower chamber , as attested by the presence of the nuclei still inside the pores , often formed large rosettes of podosomes at the pore exit ( Figure 3B arrows ) . In addition , MEF - p59 / p61Hck ca cells found in the lower chamber of transwells that had migrated through Matrigel ( 24 - hour migration ) had 2 - fold more podosome rosettes than cells seeded at the top of the Matrigel layer at the beginning of the experiment ( Figure 3B ) . These results suggested that the presence of podosome rosettes correlates with the 3D - migration ability . Actually , we observed that clone B , with a lower percentage of cells with podosome rosettes than clone A ( Figure 3C left panel ) , had a low migration capacity ( Figure 3C right panel ) , demonstrat - ing a positive correlation between the cell ability to form podosome rosettes and the transmatrix migration function . As MEF - p61Hck ca Figure 3 . Ectopic expression of Hck provides ﬁbroblasts the capacity to migrate through Matrigel . ( A ) Tet - Off MEF - 3T3 cells expressing Hck isoforms together or separately that migrated through Matrigel transwells were counted as in the legend of Figure 2C . Results are expressed as mean (cid:7) SD of 3 experiments ; parental cells were Hck - negative Tet - Off MEF - 3T3 cells . ( B ) Photomicrograph show - ing nuclei ( DAPI [ 4 , 6 diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ] : blue ) , p59 / 61Hck ca - GFP ( green ) , and F - actin ( phalloidin – tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate : red ) ; arrows indicate podosome rosettes located at the pore exit ( dotted circles ) of the transwell . p59 / 61Hck ca - MEF - 3T3 Tet - Off cells had more podosome rosettes after transmigra - tion ( 24 hours , cells examined at the bottom face of the 8 - (cid:6) m pore transwells ) than before ( 0 hours , cells examined at the top of transwells ) . ( C ) The cell migration capacity through Matrigel is correlated to the rate of podosome rosettes . The percentage of cells with podosome rosettes was quantiﬁed in 2 p59 / 61Hck ca - MEF - 3T3 Tet - Off cell clones ( clones A and B ; left panel ) and invasion assays were performed in triplicate in 4 separate experiments ( right panel ) ; * * * P (cid:8) . 001 . 1448 COUGOULE et al BLOOD , 18 FEBRUARY 2010 (cid:1) VOLUME 115 , NUMBER 7 For personal use only . on April 22 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From cells exhibited the same percentage of podosome rosettes than MEF - p59 / p61Hck ca clone A but were unable to migrate through Matrigel ( Figure 3A ) , we concluded that the presence of rosettes of podosomes and that expression of the 2 Hck isoforms are required for transmatrix migration . Hck (cid:1) / (cid:1) BMDMs failed to form large rosettes of podosomes Because the presence of rosettes of podosomes correlated with 3D - migration in Hck - expressing ﬁbroblasts , we examined these struc - tures in wt and Hck (cid:1) / (cid:1) BMDMs . On glass coverslips , adherent macrophages spontaneously formed individual podosomes but not rosettes . The number and distribution of podosomes were not different between BMDMs from wt and Hck (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice ( data not shown ) . We then plated BMDMs on several puriﬁed matrix proteins . We noticed that BMDMs spontaneously arranged their podosomes as rosettes more frequently on ﬁbronectin ( Figure 4 ) or gelatin ( Figure 5 ) than on ﬁbrinogen - coated coverslips ( data not shown ) . As shown in Figure 4A , BMDMs from wt and Hck (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice layered on ﬁbronectin had scattered individual podosomes with the characteristic ring of vinculin surrounding the F - actin core ( top 2 panels , insets ) and podosomes organized as rosettes ( bottom 2 panels ) . Rosettes of podosomes in wt BMDMs were structured as small ( (cid:1) 10 (cid:6) m ) and large ( (cid:2) 20 (cid:6) m ) diameters . In Hck (cid:1) / (cid:1) cells , the index of podosome rosettes ( number of rosettes in 100 cells ) was reduced by 40 % compared with wt BMDMs ( Figure 4B ) and small rosettes were predominant ( Figure 4A , C ) . In conclusion , podosome rosettes in Hck (cid:1) / (cid:1) BMDMs are signiﬁcantly fewer and smaller than in the wt counterpart . ECM degradation and trans - matrix migration of BMDMs are impaired by protease inhibitors Although the presence and the role of podosome rosettes in macrophages have been poorly documented , 49 , 50 we expected that ( 1 ) they mimic podosome reorganization into sealing zones in osteoclasts , the place of acidic pH and efﬁcient extracellular matrix proteolysis , and ( 2 ) similarly to Hck - expressing ﬁbroblasts ( Figure 3 ) , they are involved in 3D - migration . First we examined the matrix degradation capacity of podosome rosettes of BMDMs layered on gelatin - FITC – coated glass cover - slips for 8 hours . Matrix degradation areas were noticed beneath podosome rosettes that ﬁt with the size and shape of rosettes ( highlighted by the linescan , Figure 5A ) . Several proteases such as matrix metalloproteases ( MMPs ) MMP - 2 , MT1 - MMP , and MMP - 9 have been localized at invadopodia - podosomal structures in several cell types including osteoclasts . 31 In BMDMs , MMP - 2 , MT1 - MMP , and LysoTracker , which stains acidic compartments , colocal - ized with matrix degradation areas ( Figure 5B - C ) . To determine whether the difference in number and size of podosome rosettes between wt and Hck (cid:1) / (cid:1) BMDMs ( Figure 4 ) correlated with the ECM degradative capacity , matrix degradation areas were quantiﬁed after overnight culture of macrophages on gelatin - FITC . wt BMDMs made larger degradation areas in gelatin - FITC than Hck (cid:1) / (cid:1) macrophages ( Figure 5D - E ) . Similarly , when macrophages were seeded on thick Matrigel matrix used to perform 3D - migration experiments , Hck (cid:1) / (cid:1) BMDMs had much less degra - dative activity than wt cells as observed by scanning electron microscopy ( Figure 6A , see arrows showing matrix degradation areas beneath the cells entering into the matrix ) . To investigate the role of proteases in ECM degradation and macrophage trans - matrix migration , we used a cocktail of protease inhibitors described to inhibit protease - dependent matrix invasion by tumor cells . 24 , 51 In the presence of protease inhibitors , the following parameters were decreased : ( 1 ) degradation of FITC - coupled gelatin by wt and Hck (cid:1) / (cid:1) macrophages ( Figure 5D bottom panels and 5E ) , ( 2 ) Matrigel degradation ( Figure 6A ) , and ( 3 ) the migration capacity of wt and Hck (cid:1) / (cid:1) BMDMs through Matrigel ( Figure 6B ) . The residual migration capacity of macrophages from the 2 genotypes ( Figure 6B ) could result from the remaining ECM degradation activity observed in Figure 5D and E . Next we examined whether the low matrix degradation capacity of Hck (cid:1) / (cid:1) BMDMs could result from altered expression and / or release of matrix - degrading proteases . However , expression of MMP2 , MMP9 , and MT1 - MMP activity and release in the extracellular medium of MMP2 and MMP9 measured by zymography were similar in the 2 genotypes as shown in Figure 5F and G . Therefore , the low capacity of Hck (cid:1) / (cid:1) BMDMs to degrade the ECM is likely due to undersized podosome rosettes and not to altered proteolytic activ - ity per se . These data indicate that wt macrophages form podosome rosettes with matrix proteolytic activity and inﬁltrate Matrigel in a protease - dependent manner . For comparison , Hck (cid:1) / (cid:1) macrophages exhibit a limited capacity to form podosome rosettes , and , conse - quently , low ECM degradative and transmatrix migration activities . Therefore , Hck is a regulator for the formation of cell structures Figure 4 . Hck (cid:1) / (cid:1) BMDMs do not form large podosome rosettes .

MACROPHAGE 3D MIGRATION INVOLVES Hck 1449 BLOOD , 18 FEBRUARY 2010 (cid:1) VOLUME 115 , NUMBER 7 For personal use only . on April 22 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From involved in proteolytic - dependent transmatrix migration of macrophages . Discussion Our work provides evidence that Hck is involved in macrophage migration through interstitial tissue in physiologic and pathologic contexts . Hck is required for efﬁcient proteolytic degradation of ECM thanks to the spatial organization of podosomes as large rosettes . To reach inﬂammatory sites , monocyte / macrophages have to perform transendothelial diapedesis and migration through intersti - tial tissues . In a peritonitis model , macrophages barely reached the peritoneal cavity in Hck (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice . They accumulated in the peritoneal tissue and no defect in the vascular egress was noticed . To explain the reduced cell inﬁltration in the peritoneal cavity of Figure 5 . Podosome rosette – associated ECM degra - dation is a protease - dependent process altered in Hck (cid:1) / (cid:1) BMDMs . ( A ) Podosome rosettes exhibit ECM degradation activity . BMDMs were seeded on FITC - coupled gelatin - coated coverslips . After 24 hours , cells were ﬁxed and stained for F - actin and microscopically examined .

( D top 2 panels ) wt BMDMs form large podosome ro - settes associated with large areas of gelatin - FITC degra - dation ( arrowheads ) .

Gain - of - function experiments performed with MEF - 3T3 ﬁbroblasts show that ectopic expression of Hck provides the ability to migrate through Matrigel . Neither hck knockout in macrophages nor Hck expression in ﬁbroblasts affected 2D - migration . Interestingly , recent observations show that cell migration in 2D or 3D activates distinct molecular and cellular mechanisms . 52 , 53 Therefore , Hck appears to play a role speciﬁcally in 3D - migration . We report that trans - matrix migration of BMDMs is a protease - dependent process . This is an important observation as it was generally proposed that leukocytes migrate in a protease - independent manner ( for a review , see Friedl and Weigelin 22 ) . It is possible that leukocyte migration through loose connective tissue could operate without ECM degradation but migration through stiff matrices characterized as anatomic boundaries might require proteases . Actually , it has recently been reported that MMP9 is required in peritoneal inﬁltration of macrophages elicited by thioglycollate , 23 indicating that at least part of the in vivo migration route is protease dependent . Hck (cid:1) / (cid:1) macrophages have a reduced capacity to inﬁltrate the matrix , but the few cells that migrate use a protease - dependent mechanism . Interestingly , we observe that Hck (cid:1) / (cid:1) macrophages have a normal expression , activity , and release of proteases dedicated to matrix degradation : MMP - 2 , MMP - 9 , and MT1 - MMP . Although MMPs , which play a central role in ECM degradation , 31 are not affected , we cannot exclude that other proteases implicated in this process would be defective in Hck (cid:1) / (cid:1) macrophages . However , it appeared more promising to examine cell structures involved in matrix degradation where proteases , including MMPs , accumulate . In fact , we have shown before that Hck triggers the formation of podosome rosettes with matrix proteolytic activity . 30 Now , we report that Hck (cid:1) / (cid:1) macro - phages form few and undersized podosome rosettes with limited matrix degradation capacity . In contrast , wt macrophages exhibit large areas of proteolysed matrix underneath large and numerous podosome rosettes . Therefore defective formation of podosome rosettes in Hck (cid:1) / (cid:1) macrophages likely explains their defective ECM proteolytic activity . Several lines of evidence obtained in tumor cells show that formation of podosome - like invadopodia with proteolytic activity correlates with tissue invasiveness 40 ( for review , see Gimona et al 32 and Weaver 34 ) . In addition , we show that podosome rosettes correlated positively with the 3D - migration capacity of Hck - expressing ﬁbroblasts . Consistently , Hck (cid:1) / (cid:1) macrophages with undersized podosome rosettes have a reduced transmatrix migra - tion capacity compared with wt cells . Organization of podosomes as rosettes occurs when macrophages are activated , 49 , 50 or in contact with appropriate ECM proteins as described herein . Similarly to bone resorption pits underneath the sealing zone of macrophage - derived osteoclasts , it is likely that matrix degradation capacity is potentiated when podosomes are grouped as rosettes . 54 To avoid massive degradation , macrophage migration through tissues should operate without secreting proteases at large in the extracellular medium . Therefore , podosome structures specialized in matrix degradation that are spatially organized as large rosettes by Hck might be the appropriate structures for focal and restrained ECM proteolysis required for 3D - migration of macrophages . In conclusion , spatial organization of podosomes as large rosettes , proteolytic degradation of ECM , and 3D - migration ap - peared to be functionally linked and regulated by Hck . Tissue inﬁltration of macrophages is most of the time related to poor prognosis in cancers as it stimulates both angiogenesis and formation of metastasis . 13 Phagocytes also play a deleterious role , by increasing tissue damage during chronic infectious or inﬂamma - tory diseases . In light of the results presented in this paper , we propose that Hck could be a good pharmacologic target to inhibit macrophage tissue inﬁltration , and is , as far as we know , the ﬁrst protein combining a phagocyte - limited expression with a role in 3D migration .
