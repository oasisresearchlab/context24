National and international guidelines differ about the optimal physical distancing between students for prevention of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) transmission ; studies directly comparing the impact of ≥ 3 versus ≥ 6 ft of physical distancing policies in school settings are lacking . Thus , our objective was to compare incident cases of SARS - CoV - 2 in students and staff in Massachusetts public schools among districts with different physical distancing requirements . State guidance mandates masking for all school staff and for students in grades 2 and higher ; the majority of districts required universal masking . Methods . Community incidence rates of SARS - CoV - 2 , SARS - CoV - 2 cases among students in grades K - 12 and staff participating in - person learning , and district infection control plans were linked . Incidence rate ratios ( IRRs ) for students and staff members in traditional public school districts with ≥ 3 versus ≥ 6 ft of physical distancing were estimated using log - binomial regression ; models adjusted for community incidence are also reported . Results . Among 251 eligible school districts , 537 336 students and 99 390 staff attended in - person instruction during the 16 - week study period , representing 6 400 175 student learning weeks and 1 342 574 staff learning weeks . Student case rates were similar in the 242 districts with ≥ 3 versus ≥ 6 ft of physical distancing between students ( IRR , 0 . 891 ; 95 % confidence interval , . 594 – 1 . 335 ) ; results were similar after adjustment for community incidence ( adjusted IRR , 0 . 904 ; . 616 – 1 . 325 ) . Cases among school staff in districts with ≥ 3 versus ≥ 6 ft of physical distancing were also similar ( IRR , 1 . 015 , 95 % confidence interval , . 754 – 1 . 365 ) . Conclusions . Lower physical distancing requirements can be adopted in school settings with masking mandates without nega - tively affecting student or staff safety . Keywords . COVID - 19 ; schools ; physical distancing ; infection control ; adaptation . In March 2020 , as severe acute respiratory syndrome corona - virus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) cases were increasing across the United States , schools across the country were closed , and the vast majority stayed closed for the remainder of the school year [ 1 ] . This policy decision was based on data adapted from in - fluenza transmission , for which children and schools may be major drivers of pandemics [ 2 ] . Since schools were initially closed , new data have emerged suggesting that SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in schools is limited , provided implementation of mitigation measures , and that children and schools are not the primary drivers of the pandemic [ 3 – 5 ] . Current guidance from the World Health Organization is to maintain 1 m ( 3 . 3 ft ) between students , while the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that stu - dents maintain 6 ft of distancing ; the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends 3 – 6 ft [ 6 – 8 ] . However , the evidence for physical distancing to mitigate SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in primary and secondary educational settings remains limited . Data from different countries that have implemented different physical distancing guidance in educational settings seem to suggest no major difference between ≥ 3 and ≥ 6 ft of distancing [ 9 – 12 ] , though these studies did not directly compare different distancing requirements . To date , the impact of distancing in school settings has not been directly studied and remains a crit - ical national policy question [ 13 ] .

In June 2020 , Massachusetts’s Department of Elementary and Secondary Education ( DESE ) provided initial health and safety guidance for school reopening to prioritize student return to school buildings in the fall [ 14 ] . Schools and districts were required to prepare and submit reopening plans to the state that addressed district reopening in 3 possible learning models ( full in - person , hybrid , and remote ) and addressed ad - herence to health and safety requirements including the use of masks / face coverings , physical distancing , grouping students into cohorts to minimize student interaction , using symptom screening of staff and students , hand hygiene , facilities cleaning , and dedicating isolation space for students displaying possible symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) . Based on initial DESE guidance , students in grade 2 and above , and all staff were required to wear a mask / face cov - ering in school buildings ; districts were permitted to choose to require or recommend universal masking mandates for stu - dents in all grades . Schools were encouraged to aim for ≥ 6 ft of distancing between individuals when possible , with a minimum requirement of 3 ft of distancing between students [ 14 ] . In this retrospective analysis of data from traditional public schools in the state of Massachusetts that opened with any in - person learning , we sought to measure the effectiveness of different physical distancing policies ( ≥ 3 vs ≥ 6 ft ) on the incidence of SARS - CoV - 2 infections among students and school staff after school reopening in fall 2020 . METHODS Data Sources District Infection Control Plans Publicly available infection control plans from traditional public school districts , which were , which were developed in - dependently across the state but with guidance and ultimate approval from DESE , were identified through a variety of sources , including the Boston Globe school tracker [ 15 ] and public documents available on town Web sites . A standardized data extraction template was created using Microsoft Forms ( Supplementary Materials ) and each district plan was individu - ally reviewed and entered into the data set . Variables of interest included school model type ( eg , fully remote , hybrid , or full in - person ) and details of infection control strategies adopted by the district ( eg , physical distancing of ≥ 3 vs ≥ 6 ft ; details of masking policy , including details about how the masking policy was applied to students in younger grades ; ventilation upgrades ; and cleaning protocols ) . Districts that permitted a minimum of 3 ft of distancing , even if greater distances were “preferred , ” were classified as allowing ≥ 3 ft of distancing between students . Similarly , districts that al - lowed ≥ 3 ft of distancing for some grades , even if not for all , were classified as permitting ≥ 3 ft of distancing . Districts that implemented intermediate distancing requirements ( eg , min - imum of 4 , 4 . 5 , or 5 ft ) were excluded from the primary anal - ysis . Districts that allowed ≥ 3 ft of physical distancing in their full reopening plan but opened in a hybrid learning model with requirements of ≥ 6 ft in the hybrid model , were classified as requiring ≥ 6 ft of physical distancing . Districts with contradic - tory recommendations ( eg , statements of permitting 3 – 6 ft in some sections of the infection control plan but requiring 6 ft in others ) were excluded . Before data abstraction , 3 investigators abstracted and entered the same infection control plans . After an interrater reliability score > 80 % was achieved for all variables ( 5 districts reviewed ; 1 round ) , data abstraction and entry were continued . To ensure data quality and accuracy of the physical distancing variable , all districts that included a minimum of 3 ft of distancing in their infection control plan underwent a double - check . If there was disagreement between the 2 reviews , then a third reviewer also manually reviewed the district plan and made a final deci - sion regarding classification of the district policy . In addition , a random sample of 10 % of the districts classified as requiring ≥ 6 ft of physical distancing underwent a second review to ensure accuracy . Case and Enrollment Data We obtained data on positive SARS - CoV - 2 case counts from the DESE Web site , where they are available publicly , for the period from 24 September 2020 through 27 January 2021 [ 16 ] . District - level SARS - CoV - 2 case counts are reported by school districts to DESE weekly . Mandatory case reporting to DESE is required only for dis - tricts with any in - person learning ( full in - person or hybrid districts ) . Case counts for students include students with a laboratory - confirmed diagnosis of SARS - CoV - 2 infection who are enrolled in hybrid or in - person learning models and were in a school building within the 7 days before the positive test . Similarly , staff case counts only include those who had been in a school building in the 7 days before the laboratory - confirmed positive test . Individual school districts are responsible for re - porting these data to DESE . Student enrollment data were provided electronically to the research team from DESE [ 17 ] . Data include total enroll - ment and counts of students enrolled in each learning model , in - person , hybrid , and remote , by district . DESE obtained this information from the district information system on a biweekly basis . The in - person , hybrid , and remote counts represent what the district is reporting at that time . In - person counts vary by week and are lower in the winter surge period , although de - tailed data about school closures are not reported . Because in - person staff counts are not part of the data set , we estimated these by using the 2018 – 2019 National Center for Education Statistics Common Core of Data ( NCES CCD ) D o w n l oaded f r o m h tt p s : / / a c ade m i c . oup . c o m / c i d / ad v an c e - a r t i c l e / do i / 10 . 1093 / c i d / c i ab230 / 6167856 b y gue s t on 23 J u l y 2021 COVID - 19 Mitigation Measures in Schools • cid 2021 : XX ( XX XXXX ) • 3 statistics [ 18 ] for total full - time staff and teachers for all dis - tricts with at ≥ 5 % of enrolled students in an in - person or hybrid learning model . District demographic data ( propor - tion of children aged 5 – 17 years living in poverty and racial and ethnic enrollment within the school district ) were also obtained from NCES CCD . Community Case Data Community incidence data were obtained from USAFacts [ 19 ] , at the county level , dividing each county’s totals among the county’s zip codes and weighting by zip code population . These zip code – level community rates were matched to the district data using the zip code of the district’s location in the NCES CCD data set to provide a comparison for school rates and the surrounding community rates . Analysis Because the number of students on campus varies over the study period , we define high on - campus enrollment as dis - tricts with an average of ≥ 80 % of their total enrolled students participating in on - campus instruction throughout the time period . Lower on - campus enrollment is defined as districts with an average of < 80 % of enrolled students participating in on - campus instruction . After the 3 data sets were combined , we calculated the stu - dent and staff incidence rates for each district - week . We calcu - lated the daily student incidence rate per 100 000 students who were attending in - person or hybrid models , and the daily staff incidence rate per 100 000 staff members for districts with ≥ 5 % in - person or hybrid attendance . Weeks with < 5 % of total en - rollment as in - person or hybrid attendance were excluded from the analysis . To assess the impact of distancing policies on incidence of in - fection rates , we estimated negative binomial regression models . We used separate regression models for student and staff in - fection incidence outcomes . The key independent variable in these models was an indicator for a policy of 6 - ft distance . We also estimated models controlling for community SARS - CoV - 2 incidence and controlling for district demographic variables ( proportion of children living in poverty , racial and ethnic enrollment within the district ) . In each model , standard errors were clustered by district and all models included week fixed effects to capture week - specific factors that were constant across districts . All data were analyzed using Stata / SE 15 . 1 and Microsoft Excel 2016 software . A replication archive is available in supplementary materials . To ensure that our findings were robust and not driven by other infection control mitigation measures , we conducted 2 sensitivity analyses . First , we reestimated models after excluding districts with surveillance testing programs , and we reestimated unadjusted and adjusted incidence rate ratios ( IRRs ) . We also estimated models among districts that permitted < 6 ft of physical distancing ( eg , included districts that allowed 4 – 5 ft of distancing in the analysis ) . RESULTS Among 279 public school districts with detailed infection control plans available for review , 266 opened for any type of in - person learning during the period from 24 September 2020 to 27 January 2021 ( hybrid and / or full - in person ) . Two district ' s plans included contradictory statements regarding their phys - ical distancing policy and were excluded . Thirteen districts that remained fully remote until 1 November 2020 were also excluded , leaving 251 districts in our analysis . Of these , nine districts allowed intermediate distancing ( eg , 4 - 5 ft ) and were excluded from the primary analysis , leaving 242 districts in the primary analysis . Two districts allowed 3 ft among some grades but 6 ft among others ( one allowing 3 ft for high school , another allowing 3 ft for younger grade levels ) which were included with districts allowing 3 ft of distancing . Within districts meeting inclusion criteria , 537 336 students and 99 390 staff were in attendance in school buildings , repre - senting 6 400 175 student learning weeks and 1 342 574 staff learning weeks . During the entire study period , 4226 cases were reported in students and 2382 in school staff ( daily incidence rate by week shown in Table 1 ) . Because learning models vary by dis - trict over the study period , we instead considered on - campus en - rollment by comparing the number of students enrolled in both Table 1 .

The majority of districts that opened for any in - person learning did so with lower on - campus enrollment , which we define as an average of < 80 % of enrolled students on campus during the study pe - riod ( 161 of 251 had [ 64 . 14 % ] lower and 90 of 251 [ 35 . 86 % ] had high on - campus enrollment ) . Of the districts included , 98 . 01 % applied the same infection control policy , including distancing recommendations , across all grade levels . Of districts with any type of in - person learning , 100 % adopted universal masking for both students in grade 2 and above and for school staff . Masking was required for younger grades in 69 . 72 % of districts , although the policy was not man - dated by the state , and it was strongly encouraged by 26 . 29 % of districts . Three districts required masking for students in grade 1 and above , and 7 districts did not have details in their masking policy to comment on grade requirements . Other commonly implemented interventions included physical distancing be - tween students ( ≥ 3 ft distancing required in 48 districts , ≥ 6 ft in 194 , and 4 – 5 ft in 9 ) , cohorting of students ( 214 of 232 dis - tricts [ 92 . 24 % ] ) , enhanced disinfection protocols ( 218 of 227 [ 96 . 04 % ] ) , and mention of heterogeneous ventilation interven - tions ( 205 of 227 [ 90 . 31 % ] ) ( Table 2 ) . Districts that implemented ≥ 3 ft of distancing between stu - dents reported 895 cases among students and 431 among staff ( Figure 1 ) . Districts with ≥ 6 ft of physical distancing reported 3223 cases among students and 1908 among staff , ( unadjusted IIR , students , 0 . 891 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , . 594 - 1 . 335 ; unadjusted IIR , staff , 0 . 989 , 95 % CI , . 733 - 1 . 334 ) .

On campus enrollment changed throughout the study period ; numbers presented in the table represent the mean in - person enrollment over the study period . c During the study period , universal masking among staff and students in grades 2 and higher was a prerequisite for approval to open schools , according to the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education . Many districts opted to require ( 69 . 7 % ) or strongly recommend ( 26 . 3 % ) masking among students in younger grade levels . d Cleaning protocols were variably defined but were recorded if the district reported any enhanced protocols beyond usual practices . e Ventilation interventions were highly heterogeneous and included requirements to open windows , purchase of high - efficiency particulate air filters , plans for heating , ventilation , and air conditioning upgrades , and plans to move classrooms to outdoor spaces . f Universal influenza vaccination for all students was mandated in the state of Massachusetts during the fall of 2020 . The requirement was later waived owing to low rates of influenza during the 2020 – 2021 influenza season . g Demographic variables obtained from the National Center for Education Statistics at the district level [ 18 ] .

IRRs for the 2 distancing policies were similar in the sensitivity analyses , including the sensitivity anal - ysis including districts that adopted intermediate distancing policies ( eg , 4 – 5 ft ) ( Table 3 ) . DISCUSSION In June 2020 , the Massachusetts DESE released guidance for reopening schools that included universal masking of staff and for most students and recommended ≥ 3 to 6 ft of distancing between students . Owing to the inherent flexi - bility in the DESE recommendations , application of physical in traditional public school districts varied throughout the state of Massachusetts . In this retrospective cohort study , we leveraged this variation to evaluate the effectiveness of dif - ferent physical distancing recommendations on SARS - CoV - 2 incidence rates among students and school staff participating in any in - person learning . Using case report data from DESE and combining that data with a manually validated data set with detailed district infection control plans , we found that adoption of greater physical distancing between individuals in school buildings was not associated with significantly re - duced rates of SARS - CoV - 2 among students and staff . National and international guidance on distancing in schools is varied . The World Health Organization recommends 1 m ( 3 . 3 ft ) of distancing in school settings , while , conversely , the guid - ance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention re - commends 6 ft of distance “to the greatest extent possible , ” and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends 3 – 6 ft [ 6 – 8 ] . Several countries have published data on case rates among schoolchildren with various physical distancing recommenda - tions after school reopening , although studies directly com - paring different policies are limited . In Australia , New South Wales , children were recommended to distance 1 . 5 m ; a study evaluating SARS - CoV - 2 transmission and secondary attack rates in children who attended schools and early childhood care settings while considered infectious found low rates of transmission , with a secondary attack rate of 1 . 2 % [ 20 , 21 ] . In educational settings in England during the summer half term , children were advised to maintain distance “as able” and uni - versal masking was not required . Reported infections and out - breaks with a limited distancing policy were low , with 113 cases of infection and 55 outbreaks , among a large population ( me - dian daily student school attendance , 929 000 ) [ 22 ] . Similarly , in educational settings in Singapore , where students adopted 3 – 6 ft of distancing , case rates were low , with identification of only 3 potential transmission incidents in 3 disconnected educational settings [ 23 ] . Our study adds to the literature , as we were able to directly compare the impact of different physical distancing policies while controlling for other important mitigation measures , notably , universal masking among staff and near - universal masking among students , including those in younger grades . Our finding of no significant difference in student or staff case rates between schools with ≥ 3 versus ≥ 6 ft of distancing , with a large sample size , suggests that the lower physical distancing recommendation can be adopted in school settings without negatively affecting safety . While incidence rates in both students and staff were lower than case rates in surrounding communities , we found a strong correlation between community rates and positive cases in schools , particularly among school staff . Community trans - mission contributes to the number of individuals who enter the school building infected with SARS - CoV - 2 . A variety of factors may drive the relationship between community incidence and cases introduced into schools , including mandated compli - ance with mitigation measures , such as masking and symptom screening . The finding of the strong correlation between com - munity incidence and incidence in schools does not , however , imply that there is increased transmission in schools when com - munity disease prevalence is high , nor that community metrics should dictate school opening / closing policies . These findings have important implications for national policy on SARS - CoV - 2 infection control recommendations applied to Table 3 .

Standard errors were adjusted for clustering by school district . b Adjusted for community incidence by week . c The referent group was districts with 3 ft of physical distancing . d Demographic variables included in the model included the percentages of total enrolled students who were black , Hispanic , Asian , or other ( including Native American , Native Alaskan , Native Hawaiian , Pacific Islander , ≥2 races , unknown , and other rate ) , and the percentage of children aged 5 – 17 years in poverty . One district was missing poverty data and was dropped from the regression analysis . e The referent group was districts with < 6 ft of physical distancing .

The practical implication of a 6 - ft distancing rec - ommendation is that many schools are unable to open for full - in person learning , or at all , owing to physical limitations of school infrastructure . This is particularly true in public school districts , which are unable to limit the number of students enrolled , com - pared with private schools , which have been able to more suc - cessfully open with 6 ft of distance between individuals [ 24 ] . Three feet of physical distancing is more easily achieved in most school buildings , including public ones , and relaxing distancing requirements would thus be likely to increase the number of students who could benefit from additional in - person learning . Our data also suggest that intermediate distances ( 4 or 5 ft ) can be adopted without negatively affecting safety ; adoption of in - termediate distancing policies might be leveraged as a stepwise approach to return more students to the classroom . Our study was limited by lack of complete data on potential cases among students and school staff ; only cases reported to the state could be included in our analysis , so it is possible that some cases were missed . However , it is unlikely that cases were differentially missed in districts with 3 versus 6 ft of distancing , mitigating the impact of this limitation on our main study finding . We also did not have detailed contact tracing data available and so were not able to determine whether cases in students were due to transmissions that happened within the school environment or independent introductions from cases acquired in the community . During the study period , active sur - veillance programs were rare , so we could not identify asympto - matic cases that may have resulted from in - school transmission or measure the effectiveness of this intervention as a tool for controlling SARS - CoV - 2 spread in school settings . In addition , we were not able to measure the impact of phys - ical distancing stratified by school type ( elementary , middle , or high ) or age group . Thus , it is possible that the intervention may be more effective in one school type or age group ; however , the vast majority of the districts included in the study ( 98 % ) adopted the same distancing policy , suggesting that findings are broadly applicable . We were not able to fully exclude a small benefit of greater physical distancing requirements among stu - dent cases , but , because of our large sample size , we can con - clude that more restrictive physical distancing policies would not have substantial impact on preventing cases in students at - tending in - person schooling . It is possible that districts that of - ficially allowed ≥ 3 ft of distancing between students ultimately succeeded in attaining more distance , and our methods were only able to capture official policy , not real - world implementa - tion of the policy . We also were not able to examine how lower distancing pol - icies may have affected school closures ; it is possible that districts with lower distancing requirements closed more frequently , or required more quarantines , because of how SARS - CoV - 2 ex - posures are defined . Finally , we were not able to fully evaluate the impact of other types of infection control interventions , owing to a lack of variation across the state . In particular , we were not able to examine the impact of universal masking owing to nearly 100 % adoption of this intervention , however , data from other sources and other settings clearly highlight the importance of masking as a mitigation measure and the fact that mask compliance in school settings is high [ 4 , 25 ] . In conclusion , increasing minimum physical distancing re - quirements from 3 to 6 ft in school settings is not associated with a reduction in SARS - CoV - 2 cases among students or staff , provided that other mitigation measures , such as universal masking , are implemented . These findings may be used to up - date guidelines about SARS - CoV - 2 mitigation measures in school settings .
