We aimed to describe the data on secondary transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 among students and teachers / personnel after the reopening of preschools and schools in Reggio Emilia , Italy . Methods : This prospective population - based study included all consecutive cases leading to an investigation in 41 classes of 36 educational institutions ( 8 infant - toddler centres and preschools , 10 primary and 18 secondary schools ) in the period September 1 – October 15 , 2020 , in Reggio Emilia province , Italy . We report the characteristics of the school , of the index case , including the possible source of infection , the number of contacts ( students and teachers / personnel ) that were identified and tested and the characteristics of secondary cases . Results : In the study period , 994 students and 204 teachers were tested during related investigations due to notification of 43 primary cases ( 38 among students and 5 among teachers ) . Of these , 10 students and two teachers created 39 secondary cases , resulting in an attack rate of 3 . 9 % . There were no secondary cases among teachers / stuff . Secondary transmission occurred in one primary school and 8 secondary schools . Except for two students and one teacher , the possible source of infection for all index cases was identified as they had all had previous contact with a positive case ; the majority of secondary cases did not report any previous close contact with a positive case . The clusters ranged from one to 22 secondary cases . Conclusions : Transmission at school occurred in a non - negligible number of cases , particularly in secondary schools . Prompt testing and isolation of classmates could probably reduce the risk of transmission in school settings . .

Therefore , limiting attendance or closing schools is the single action that can immediately reduce the largest number of social contacts . During the COVID - 19 pandemic , all efforts to reduce social contacts have been made , and in most countries , these measures have targeted schools as well . These measures have shown to have several consequences on the psychosocial wellbeing of children and adolescents ( 1 - 5 ) and , if prolonged , may have a serious impact on the effectiveness of education in this new generation . It is therefore important to understand the role of transmission occurring in schools in the spread of the SARS - CoV - 2 virus . This task is made more complex because the vast majority of children and adolescents are asymptomatic : in the absence of screening , most infections are not diagnosed and they are rarely identified as index cases in clusters outside of school . One recent Italian study reported the number of cases occurring in students attending schools ( 6 ) , suggesting a low incidence among students . However , this figure does not measure the risk of transmission at school since we do not know where those infections were acquired ; this figure is mostly determined by the circulation of the virus in that particular moment in the community . A Korean study showed very low transmission rates in kindergartens ( 7 ) . Thus , the role of schools in virus transmission could be limited ( 8 , 9 ) , meaning that control measures could be oriented elsewhere ( 10 ) . Nevertheless , it is important to collect this information in different countries since the risk of transmission likely depends on many characteristics , such as the social distancing measures adopted in that country , the infrastructural and climatic contexts and the behaviours of children , which are influenced by age and cultural factors . In this short communication we present the results of 41 investigations conducted after the identification of SARS - CoV - 2 infection . Methods Setting Reggio Emilia province , northern Italy , has 530 , 000 inhabitants . The cumulative incidence of cases during the first wave of the pandemic ( March – April 2020 ) was about 0 . 9 % . There are approximately 31000 children attending infant - toddler centres ( ages 0 - 3 years ) , preschools ( ages 3 - 5 ) , primary schools ( ages 6 - 10 ) , middle schools ( ages 11 - 13 ) and high schools ( ages 14 - 19 ) . Infant - toddler centres and preschools reopened on September 1 , and some special courses in high schools were held , but the official reopening of all schools was on September 15 , after three months of very low COVID - 19 incidence ( figure ) . In October , the province began experiencing a second wave of the pandemic , with cumulative incidence reaching 1 . 8 % . While the first wave was characterized by very high fatality rate ( up to 18 % in the first month ) ( 11 ) and testing limited only to symptomatic individuals , who often presented with severe symptoms , during the endemic period and the beginning of the second wave , most cases have been asymptomatic and identified through active contact tracing . The case fatality rate has dropped to < 2 % . Study design .

We report the characteristics of the school , of the index case , including the possible source of infection , and the number of contacts ( students and teachers / personnel ) that were identified and tested . When secondary cases were identified , we also provide a description of the cases , with the possible source of infection , to rule out a source of infection outside of school . The study was approved by the Area Vasta Emilia Nord Ethics Committee ( n . 2020 / 0045199 ) . Policies of social distancing in schools During the study period , schools adopted the following social distancing measures : mandatory wearing of surgical masks at all times except when students are seated at their desk and are not speaking ; only single desks are used ( rather than the traditional double desks ) , and desks must be at least one meter apart ; crowding at separate school entrances and exits is minimized by creating temporal and spatial pathways for the different classes ; mixing classes for curricular activities is minimized ; extra - curricular activities have all been suspended ( 12 ) . In some schools , when the classrooms are not big enough to respect social distancing , students are divided into two groups , which alternate attending school and remote learning . Wearing a mask in primary schools is never mandatory ( 12 ) . Contact tracing procedures All SARS - CoV - 2 - positive tests performed by the Local Health Authority molecular lab are automatically reported to the Public Health Department , as are the positive lab results of those Reggio Emilia residents who performed the test outside the province . The Local Health Authority starts an epidemiological survey for each case , identifying all close contacts from the 48 hours before symptom onset ; these individuals are immediately isolated and tested at least six days after the first contact with the index case , and are retested before the end of the 14 days of quarantine . When a case attends or teaches / personnel at a school , everyone in the class is immediately tested ; if the swab is performed earlier than six days from the last contact with the index case , a second swab is also collected at 10 / 14 days . The epidemiological investigation includes an assessment of the nature of the contact between the index case and his / her classmates , which determines isolation measures : a ) all students are isolated if the physical classroom itself makes maintaining distance impossible and / or masks are not worn constantly and / or if secondary cases are ascertained ; or b ) only those in close contact or who have contact outside of school are isolated , provided that social distancing with the other students has been respected . If classmates are not isolated and didactic activities continue at school ( rather than remote ) , mask wearing is mandatory all the time once a case has been identified . Results Description of the index cases and their contacts In the study period , 41 classes in 36 different schools were notified : eight infant - toddler centres and preschools , 10 primary and 18 secondary schools ( Table 1 ) . Nine hundred and ninety - four students and 204 teachers were tested during the epidemiological investigations . In all cases , only single classes were considered , except in a preschool , where a larger group ( a so - called bubble ) sharing common spaces was tested , and in a secondary school , where two classes that did curricular activities together were tested . .

The attack rate was higher in secondary schools ( 6 . 64 % ) than in primary schools ( 0 . 44 % ) , while there were no secondary cases in the preschool settings . There were no secondary cases among tested teachers and staff members . Description of school clusters Regarding the cluster in the primary school ( Cluster 1 ) , the index case had been infected most probably by the relative ( Table available upon request - see Data Availability Statement ) . All the classmates , teachers and school staff were tested ; only one asymptomatic case was found . One of the two clusters ( Cluster 2 ) in a secondary school was identified after a student tested positive ; his family member tested positive after returning from a high - incidence area . Both the index case and the family member were asymptomatic . Three positive cases were identified ; all developed mild symptoms . No other possible sources of transmission were identified for the three cases . Investigation of the other cluster in secondary school ( Cluster 3 ) started after the almost simultaneous reporting of two cases in a class : one symptomatic student tested positive and one contact of a family cluster tested positive a day after . All the classmates and teachers were tested and isolated . Six resulted positive , two of whom reporting mild symptoms ten days before positivity of the swab . An analysis of the possible sources outside of school and dates of symptom onset made it possible to identify the asymptomatic case , as the only index case . Investigations of Clusters 5 and 7 in two different secondary schools started after three siblings ( all asymptomatic ) reported contact with their symptomatic family member . Both clusters had one secondary case . In Cluster 6 , both the index case and the secondary case had previous contact with a positive person , and the temporal association was difficult to establish . For Clusters 4 and 8 , no possible sources of infection were identified . The clusters in the middle school ( Cluster 9 ) occurred in several of the schools under the same administration . There were four cases each in two classes and two , five and six in one class each . The index cases were possibly two teachers working at the school . A possible contact outside of school was reported for only one secondary case , but it was not possible to identify the reported case . At least one case in only two classes reported possible sources of infection outside the school , but both classes had also had close contact with the positive teachers . No contacts outside of school were identified for the other three classes , and the dates are compatible with transmission between cases from different classrooms and buildings . Discussion Secondary cases occurred in 13 out of 41 classes , generated from 39 index cases with a secondary attack rate of 3 . 9 % . The largest cluster , with 22 secondary cases , occurred in a middle school . Accordingly , the attack rate was higher in secondary schools than in primary schools , while in the .

The inclusion criteria ( all consecutive cases ) , the uniform investigation protocol applied during this phase of the epidemic ( testing all classmates ) and the population - based nature of the study allowed us to estimate a risk of secondary cases in this context that is not biased by a selection of clusters . This report is limited by the low number of clusters analysed but has the advantage of an accurate analysis of the chain of transmission , which allowed an assessment of cases with a very high plausibility of transmission occurring from one classmate to another . This made it possible to reasonably rule out other sources . Another limit of these investigations is that they cannot distinguish between transmissions occurring in the classroom and those linked to activities and behaviours outside of school , such as public transports or leisure time . Furthermore , for two cases it was impossible to determine for exactly how many days the students shared the same classroom while the index case was still infectious because he was asymptomatic . Despite the fact that SARS - CoV - 2 incidence was increasing rapidly in this period , this did not interfere with our analyses since we did not identify any other prevalent cases in classes , and all positive cases were most probably secondary cases of the identified index case . Our data cannot be compared with those recently reported by the Italian COVID - 19 surveillance system ( 6 ) because our aim was to quantify the risk of secondary transmission in schools and not the incident rate among students and teachers . Contact - tracing studies conducted in schools and educational settings in Australia , Singapore and Ireland found low rates or even no secondary cases ( 13 - 15 ) . Only one study reports of screening at the reopening of kindergartens in Korea , which found only one possible secondary case out of 45 cases identified while attending the school ( 7 ) . Similarly , a low student - to - student attack rate was found in the UK when analyzing predominantly preschools and elementary schools ( 16 ) and in Germany for all ages ( 17 ) . These findings are in line with our report of only one secondary case in elementary schools ( out of 10 primary cases ) and no secondary case in pre - school ( out of 8 primary cases ) , but not with our results for secondary schools . The policy of not immediately isolating all classmates and delays in testing might explain the difference between our results and those observed in Germany . On the other hand , one large cluster with a high attack rate among students and teachers has been reported in a high school in Israel ( 18 ) . Clusters of cases and route of transmission have been investigated in other workplaces whose structural characteristics may be similar to those of schools , i . e . open spaces where people spend several hours every day . Some studies have reported a much higher attack rate of secondary cases than that reported in our series ( 19 , 20 ) . It is worth noting that in most of these cluster analyses , sporadic cases not leading to any known secondary cases are not included , and often only the largest clusters are investigated with well - defined inclusion criteria and scientifically sound methods , allowing publication . Thus , the quality constraints required for scientific publication probably introduced a bias toward overestimating the risk of secondary transmission in workplace settings . Indeed , in a systematic assessment of secondary cases in Brunei , workplaces showed a lower attack rate ( < 1 % ) than did households ( 10 . 6 % ) ( 21 ) . Conclusions Transmission within schools occurred in a non - negligible number of cases , particularly in secondary schools . More timely isolation and testing of classmates and their teachers may likely be effective in reducing virus transmission in this setting . .
