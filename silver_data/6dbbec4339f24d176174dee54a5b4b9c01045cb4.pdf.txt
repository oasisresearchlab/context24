In this study , we hypothesized that circulating T cells are heterogeneous and can be grouped according to their differential migratory capacity in response to chemoattractants , rather than expressions of certain receptors or cytokines . We further hypothesized that , at least in part , this intrinsic difference in motility may be related to the T cell function . We established motile ( m - T ) and non - motile T ( nm - T ) cell lines based on their response to the chemokine SDF - 1 a . m - T cells showed more irregular and polarized morphologies than nm - T cells did . Interestingly , m - T cells produced higher levels of IL - 2 , a marker for T cell activation , than nm - T cells did after stimulation ; however , no differences were observed in terms of surface expression of T cell receptors ( TCR ) , adhesion molecules LFA - 1 and ICAM - 1 , and chemokine receptor CXCR4 . Both cell lines also showed similar membrane events ( i . e . , T cell - APC conjugation , LFA - 1 accumulation at the immunological synapse , and TCR internalization ) . In contrast , PKC - h , a downstream of PI3K - Akt pathway was constitutively activated in m - T cells and the activation was more prominent during T cell stimulation . Consequently , NF - k B activity was selectively upregulated in m - T cells . This study is the first , to our knowledge , to demonstrate that T cells can be subcategorized on the basis of their intrinsic migratory capacity in relation to T cell activation .

During infection with a pathogen , a series of events occur for the initiation of an immune response and elimination of the pathogen . The initial phase of the response is mediated by the recruitment of antigen - presenting cells ( APCs ) , such as macro - phages and dendritic cells . Activated APCs then migrate to lymphoid organs , and as a result , circulating naı¨ve T cells first encounter the antigens on APCs in SLOs . This event stimulates naı¨ve T cells to produce cytokines , which are required for clonal expansion and differentiation of naı¨ve T cells into effector T cells . The migratory event of T lymphocytes is therefore a prerequisite and an indispensable process in triggering immune responses . Trafficking of naı¨ve T cells is controlled by a sequence of at least three molecularly distinct adhesion and signaling events [ 4 , 5 ] . These adhesion cascades are initiated by a tethering step that allows leukocytes to bind loosely to endothelial cells . The marginated cells are then pushed forward in the blood stream , resulting in their slow rolling along the vessels ( step 1 ) . Sub - sequently , rolling cells encounter chemotactic stimuli on the endothelium that engage specific leukocyte receptors ( step 2 ) . Chemoattractant binding , in turn , induces intracellular signals , triggering activation - dependent adhesion steps that allow leuko - cytes to stick firmly together ( step 3 ) and emigrate through the vessel wall . During cell migration , lymphocytes obtain highly specialized motility and undergo morphological changes from round and symmetrical to a polarized and asymmetrical shape , because of chemokine - induced rapid actin polymerization and filament turnover [ 6 ] . The polarity of the T cells plays an important role in T cell sensitivity to antigens on APCs [ 7 ] . Thus , we hypothesized that circulating T cells are heterogeneous in terms of motility or polarity ; therefore , they can be subcategorized according to their differential migratory capacities and different levels of sensitivities to chemoattractants . In addition , this intrinsic difference may be related to T cell functions . To this end , we established motile ( m ) and non - motile ( nm ) T cell lines , which show differential responses to chemokine stromal cell - derived factor - 1 a ( SDF - 1 a ) . The human chemokine system currently includes more than 50 chemokines , which can be classified by their cellular distribution and specific roles , e . g . , ‘‘inflammatory chemokines for effector T cell function’’ and ‘‘homeostatic chemokines for naı¨ve or memory T cells’’ [ 8 ] . Homeostatic chemokines are constitutively expressed , and they regulate the migration of lymphocytes and their precursors . Inflammatory chemokines are inducible , and they regulate the lymphocyte migration into tissues in response to an inflammatory stimulus , e . g . , tissue damage , inflammation , or infection . In this study , because we aimed to determine whether PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 1 March 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 3 | e59793 there is any relationship between T cell activation and T cell migratory capacity in the condition that mimics the SLO - like environment , SDF - 1 a was chosen . This chemokine was chosen because it is a general homeostatic chemokine for naı¨ve T cells [ 8 ] , and most lymphocytes express CXCR4 ( C - X - C chemokine receptor type 4 ) , a SDF - 1 a receptor . In addition , SDF - 1 a induces by far the greatest lymphocyte transendothelial migration of the chemokines tested [ 9 ] . Therefore , we could establish cell lines on the basis of only a single parameter , i . e . , cellular migratory capacity . In this study , we utilized T cells that originated from 3 different sources , i . e . , Jurkat T cells , human peripheral T cells , and mouse T cells . We characterized the features of m - T and nm - T cells and further determined that m - T cells exhibited elevated NF - k B activity through the PI3K - Akt signaling pathway and showed increased secretion of the cytokine IL - 2 in response to the T - cell activation signals .

Establishment of Motile and Non - motile Jurkat or Primary Human and Mouse T cells To establish Jurkat T cell lines with motile and non - motile phenotypes , cells ( 1 6 10 6 cells / ml ) were placed in the upper chamber of a 5 m m pore polycarbonate filter ( Costar , Cambridge , MA ) , while hSDF - 1 a ( 50 nM ) was present in the lower chamber , as described previously [ 10 ] . Cells that migrated across the filter into the lower chamber for the first 2 h were collected for establishing Jurkat motile - T ( Jm - T ) cells , whereas the remaining cells which had not transmigrated for 24 h in the upper chamber were collected for Jurkat non - motile T ( Jnm - T ) cells . Harvested cells were cultured for 2 days in fresh new media to recover and increase cell numbers . The proportion of two different cell groups was increased by five further rounds of transmigration . Schematic diagram was also shown in Fig . 1A . To establish human m - T and nm - T cells ( Hm - T and Hnm - T ) , human PBLs were isolated by the method described above and were incubated with PHA ( 1 m g / ml ) and recombinant human IL - 2 ( 10 U / ml ) for 3 days for inducing proliferation . To establish mouse m - T and nm - T cells ( Mm - T and Mnm - T ) , mouse T cells were isolated by the method described above , and the cells were incubated with Con A ( 2 m g / ml ) , as per the previously described method [ 11 ] . Separation of human or mouse m - T and nm - T cells were also performed as per the method described for establishing Jm - T and Jnm - T cell lines . During the separation , primary T cells were maintained with rIL - 2 ( 10 U / ml ) . Cell viability was assessed by performing the trypan blue exclusion method , and over 90 % of the viable cells were used for experiments . Immunofluorescence and Confocal Imaging Analysis For live - time analysis , cells were stained with anti - CD3 - Fab - cy3 or LFA - 1 - Fab - cy3 for 1 h at 4 u C and then incubated for 15 – 30 min with SEE - pulsed Raji B cells stained with Cell Tracker Green CMFDA ( Invitrogen ) in a live chamber device . In some cases , cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 u C on PLL - coated coverslips ( 18 - mm diameter ; Fisher Scientific , Pittsburgh , PA ) , then fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS and washed twice with PBS . The cells were permeabilized with 0 . 1 % TritonX - 100 in PBS and washed twice with PBS . The cells were then incubated with anti - CD3 - Fab - cy3 or LFA - 1 - Fab - cy3 , and phal - loidin - TRITC in blocking buffer overnight at 4 o C , rinsed three times with PBS , and mounted with anti - fade solution ( Invitrogen ) . The slides were examined with a FV1000 confocal laser scanning microscope ( Olympus , Tokyo , Japan ) equipped with 100 6 objectives .

Reactions were terminated by adding 500 m l of 4 % paraformal - dehyde . Fixed cells were washed once with PBS and resuspended in PBS containing 1 % BSA and 0 . 25 % Triton X - 100 for 5 min . After permeabilization , cells were washed , stained for 30 min with TRITC - phalloidin , and analyzed by flow cytometry . The raw amount of F - actin was represented as the mean fluorescence intensity ( MFI ) . Cell Migration Assay Transwell cell migration was assayed using a 96 well Boyden chamber ( ChemoTx plate , Neuroprobe , Inc . , Gaithersburg , MD ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . The Boyden chamber was assembled with polyvinylpyrrolidone - free polycar - bonate filters ( 3 – 5 - m m pore size ) . Jm - T and Jnm - T cells ( 5 6 10 4 ) were added to the upper compartment and 50 nM hSDF - 1 a containing media were added to the lower compart - ment and incubated for 2 h at 37 u C in a humidified CO 2 incubator . Cells remaining on the top surface of the filter were removed by suction , and those migrating to the lower chamber were harvested . The bottom well was washed two times with PBS , after the last wash , cells were resuspended in 300 m l of PBS and were analyzed by performing flow cytometry for a fixed period of time ( 300 s ) under constant middle pressure . Chemokinesis was assessed by directly observing the migrating cells in the PC - R - 10 bath flow chamber ( Live Cell Instruments ) after addition of human or mouse SDF - 1 a . Differential in - terference contrast ( DIC ) images were obtained for 1 h at 30 s intervals using a 60 6 oil immersion objective on FV1000 confocal microscope ( Olympus ) . To track migration paths , series of images were analyzed using MetaMorph image analysis software ( Molec - ular Devices Corporation , Downingtown , PA ) . T Cell Stimulation Cells were stimulated with either plate - bound anti - CD3 ( OKT3 for human , 2C11 for mouse , 10 m g / ml ) / CD28 ( 2 m g / ml ) or PMA ( 200 nM ) / A23187 ( 1 m M ) . For superantigen stimulation , cells were incubated with SEE ( 1 m g / ml ) - pulsed Raji B cells . RT - PCR and Real - time qRT - PCR Total RNA was isolated from cells with TRIzol reagent and reverse - transcribed by using RT - PreMix ( iNtRON Biotechnolo - gy ) . PCR was performed with the following primers ( the respective forward and reverse pairs are indicated ) : human IL - 2 , 5 9 - CACGTCTTGCACTTGTCAC - 3 9 and 5 9 - CCTTCTTGGGCATGTAAAACT - 3 9 ; human GAPDH , 5 9 - CGGAGTCAACGGATTTGGTCGTAT - 3 9 and 5 9 - AGCCTTCTCCATGGTGGTGAAGAC - 3 9 ; human c - Rel , 5 9 - CGAACCCAATTTATGACAACCG - 3 9 and 5 9 - TTTTGTTTCTTTGCTTTATTGCCG - 3 9 ; human p65 , 5 9 - TGGATGGACAGGCGTTG - 3 9 and 5 9 - AGACAGGACCTCT - GAGAAA - 3 9 . The amplification profile was composed of de - naturation at 94 u C for 30 s , annealing at 60 u C for 20 s , and extension at 72 u C for 40 s . The 30 cycles were preceded by denaturation at 72 u C for 7 min . Total RNA was isolated and cDNA was synthesized . PCR amplification was performed in DNA Engine Opticon1 ( MJ Research ) for continuous fluorescence detection in a total volume of 10 m l containing 1 m l of cDNA / control and gene - specific primers by using SYBR Premix Ex Taq ( Takara Bio ) . The mRNA levels of the target genes , relative to GAPDH , were normalized by using the following formula : relative mRNA expression = 2 2 ( D Ct of target gene 2 D Ct of GAPDH ) , where Ct is the threshold cycle value . In each sample , the expression of the gene being analyzed was normalized to that of GAPDH and described as the relative mRNA levels to GAPDH or % of maximum . ELISA Cells ( 1 6 10 6 ) were stimulated as described earlier . After 6 – 24 h , the amounts of IL - 2 in supernatants from three replicas for each condition were determined by ELISA with Duo Set Human or Mouse ELISA kits for IL - 2 ( R & D Systems ) . Conjugation Assay Raji B cells were stained with Cell Tracker Orange CMRA ( Molecular Probes , Invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer’s directions , incubated in the presence or absence of superantigen ( SEE for human , 1 m g / ml ) for 1 h , washed , and resuspended at a density of 1 6 10 6 cells / ml in RPMI . Jm - T and Jnm - T cells were stained with Cell Tracker Green CMFDA ( Molecular Probes , Invitrogen ) and resuspended at a density of 1 6 10 6 cells / ml in RPMI . For T cell – APC conjugation , equal volumes of T cells and APCs were mixed together and incubated at 37 u C for 30 min . The relative proportion of red , green , and red - green populations was determined by a Coulter EPICS XL flow cytometer ( Beckman Coulter ) . The number of gated events counted per sample was at least 10 , 000 . TCR Internalization Assay Cells ( 1 6 10 6 ) were stimulated with anti - CD3 / 28 antibody for indicated time and stained with PE - conjugated anti - TCR ab mAb ( Invitrogen ) at 4 u C for 1 h . Cells were then washed with cold PBS to remove unbound antibody and surface - TCR ab uorescence was measured by Coulter EPICS XL ow cytometer ( Beckman Coulter ) . The rate of internalization was quantified by following the equation : mean uorescence intensity ( MFI ) at 0 h of unstimulated condition – MFI at each time point of unstimulated or stimulated conditions . Western Blotting Cells were lysed in Triton X - 100 lysis buffer containing Tris - HCl at pH 7 . 4 ( 20 mM ) , NaCl ( 150 mM ) , 1 tablet of Complete protease inhibitors , and phosphatase inhibitors ( cocktails I and II ) . The lysates were centrifuged at 20 , 000 g for 25 min at 4 u C , and the supernatant was eluted with SDS sample buffer ( 100 mM Tri - HCl , pH 6 . 8 ; 4 % SDS ; 20 % glycerol with bromophenol blue ) and Figure 1 .

The proteins were separated through 10 % SDS - PAGE gels and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane ( Amersham ) by means of Trans - Blot SD semidry transfer cell ( Bio - Rad ) . The membrane was blocked in 5 % skim milk for 1 h at room temperature , rinsed , and incubated with the intended antibodies in TBS containing 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 ( TBS - T ) and 3 % skim milk for 2 h at room temperature . Excess primary antibody was then removed by washing the membrane four times in TBS - T . The membrane was then incubated with 0 . 1 m g / ml peroxidase - labeled secondary antibody ( anti - rabbit or anti - mouse ) for 2 h at room temperature . After three washes in TBS - T , bands were visualized by using ECL western blotting detection reagents ( iNtRON Biotechnology ) and exposed onto X - ray film . Luciferase Promoter Assay Cells ( 2 6 10 6 ) were transfected with 100 m l of Amaxa’s Nucleofector solution ( Amaxa , Cologne , Germany ) containing 3 m g of pGL3 - NF - AT , pGL3 - NF - k B , and pGL3 - IL2 Luc plasmids with pRL - TK . After 24 h , transfected cells ( 2 6 10 6 ) were stimulated with anti - CD3 / 28 for 12 h . Cells were harvested and lysed in a lysis buffer ( Promega , Madison , WI ) and proteins were extracted by a freeze - thaw cycle , and cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 4 u C for 20 min . Luciferase activity was measured with a Centro LB 960 Luminometer ( Berthold Technologies , Germany ) according to the manufacturer’s instruc - tions . Reporter activity was presented as fold induction of Luciferase activity over that of control cells . Statistics The mean values were calculated from data taken from at least three ( usually three or more ) separate experiments conducted on separate days . Where significance testing was performed , an unpaired Student’s t - test was used . We considered differences between groups significant at P , 0 . 05 . Results Jm - T Cells Showed Polarized Shapes with High Sensitiveness to Chemokine As explained in Materials and Methods , Jurkat motile T ( Jm - T ) or non - motile T ( Jnm - T ) cells were established using a modified transwell selection system ( Fig . 1A ) . To characterize each group of isolated cells , we first assessed morphological changes as well as distribution of surface proteins such as CD3 and LFA - 1 on established T cell lines . Jm - T cells appeared as an elongated form with a polarized shape along with the asymmetric distribution of CD3 and LFA - 1 , while Jnm - T cells were round and unpolarized ( Fig . 1B ) . To assess the ability of Jm - T cells to respond to chemokine , we investigated directional migration and motility by using Boyden chamber assays . As shown in Fig . 1C , Jm - T cells migrated three times more than parent cells . In contrast , Jnm - T cells migrated toward SDF - 1 a approximately 0 . 3 - fold slower than parent cells did . Furthermore , we found a significant increment in F - actin levels by SDF - 1 a in Jm - T cells ( Fig . 1D ) . To analyze the random migratory behavior in each group , cells were recorded by time - lapse confocal microscopy at 10 - sec intervals , and an overlay of migratory T cell tracks from at least 40 individual cells was created . Furthermore , we measured the average travel distance of those populations ( Fig . 1E ) . Compared with Jnm - T cells , Jm - T cells showed high motility in response to hSDF - 1 a . Taken together , these results suggest that our experimental system is well established for further characterization of motile and non - motile T cells . Jm - T Cells Showed Higher Responsiveness to Activation We investigated whether the differential motility and chemokine response observed in the two cell lines had any correlation to T cell activation . Compared with Jnm - T cells , Jm - T cells showed a significant increase in IL - 2 mRNA levels after stimulation with anti - CD3 / 28 or incubation with SEE - pulsed Raji B cells , and even treatment with PMA / A23187 ( Fig . 2A ) . To test whether the increase in IL - 2 mRNA expression in Jm - T cells was correlated with the level of protein and promoter activity , we also performed an ELISA and luciferase activity assay . As shown in Fig . 2B and 2C , IL - 2 secretion and IL - 2 promoter activity in Jm - T cells treated with anti - CD3 / 28 were significantly higher than those in Jnm - T cells . Taken together , these results demonstrate that Jm - T cells had a better activation capability in response to activation signals than did Jnm - T cells . Jm - T and Jnm - T Cells showed Similar Early Events Initiated from the Cell Membrane during T cell Activation To determine whether higher responsiveness to activation in Jm - T cells is caused by different early events initiated from the cell membrane , we first investigated the surface expression of ICAM - 1 , LFA - 1 , CD3 e chain and CXCR4 in resting state of each cell line . As shown in Fig . 3A , surface expression of the indicated proteins did not significantly change in either cell line . Many T cell - regulating molecules are located in a specialized junctional structure referred to as the immunological synapse during T cell contact with APCs [ 12 ] . We next examined the mature immunological synapse by measuring the clustering of membrane proteins , including CD3 , a key molecule of the c - SMAC , and LFA - 1 , a p - SMAC molecule ; however , the clustering pattern of CD3 and LFA - 1 in the SMAC was similar between the groups ( Fig . 3B ) . Furthermore , activation of T cells also leads to the internalization of TCR ab , we tested TCR ab internalization after activation . As shown in Fig . 3C , no significant difference in CD3 / 28 - induced TCR ab internalization was observed between the groups . On the other hands , immunological synapse formation and maintenance are required for T cell activation [ 13 ] . Therefore , we performed a conjugation assay after incubation with SEE - pulsed or un - pulsed Raji B cells . Interestingly , Jm - T cells slightly increased T - B conjugates regardless of SEE ( Fig . 3D ) , suggesting that increased F - actin contents and rapid F - actin polymerization in Jm - T cells ( Fig . 1D ) may affect the increased stabilization of immunological synapse between T cells and APCs . Collectively , these results suggest that the initial membrane events for T cell activation are not involved in the hyper - activation of Jm - T cells , but rather , signaling pathways that mediate rapid and dynamic actin rearrangement may affect the hyper - activation of Jm - T cells . PI3K - Akt Pathway is Constitutively Activated and NF - k B Activity is Consequently Higher in Jm - T Cells To investigate the differences in intracellular signal transduction processes that are related to the higher production of IL - 2 in Jm - T cells between the two groups , we next determined phosphorylation of downstream signaling molecules after stimulation with TCR / CD3 . Contrary to our expectations , TCR - proximal – signaling molecules , such as ZAP70 and SLP76 , were not significantly phosphorylated in Jm - T cells compared with those in Jnm - T cells , although phospho - ERK level was slightly enhanced in Jm - T cells ( Fig . 4A ) . We next investigated phosphoinositide3 - kinase ( PI3K ) - Akt signaling , which is known to be triggered by CD28 receptor engagement [ 14 ] . Activation of PI3K - Akt is also a robust signaling event shared by TCR and co - stimulatory receptors as well as most chemokine receptors , contributing to several aspects of T - lymphocyte activation and migration by regulation of actin cytoskeleton Activation of Motile T Cells PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 5 March 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 3 | e59793 reorganization and other components of the general migratory machinery [ 15 , 16 ] . Interestingly , PI3K and Akt were constitu - tively activated even in the resting state and highly phosphorylated in response to anti - CD3 / 28 stimulation in Jm - T cells . Phosphor - ylation of PKC - h , a downstream target protein of Akt , was also more enhanced in Jm - T cells than in Jnm - T cells ( Fig . 4B ) . Phosphorylation and translocation of PKC - h is a key step for NF - k B activation [ 17 , 18 ] . We found that NF - k B promoter activity was significantly increased in Jm - T cells by TCR / CD3 activation ( Fig . 4C ) . In contrast , interestingly , no significant difference in NF - AT promoter activity was observed between Jm - T and Jnm - T cells ( Fig . 4C ) . Along this line , a considerable increase in the expression of c - Rel and p65 , NF - k B subunits , mRNA was observed in Jm - T cells in response to anti - CD3 / 28 stimulation ( Fig . 4D ) . The activation of NF - k B requires phosphorylation and degradation of I - k B , a component of NF - k B that binds to NF - k B and blocks the nuclear translocation of NF - k B . Although TCR - mediated I - k B degradation was detected in both Jm - T and Jnm - T cells , it was prolonged up to 90 min after anti - CD3 / 28 stimulation in m - T cells ( Fig . 4E ) . In contrast , the NF - AT phosphorylation state in Jm - T cells was similar to that observed in Jnm - T cells . Taken together , these results demonstrate that Jm - T cells are more strongly activated than Jnm - T cells through activation of the PI3K - Akt - NF - k B axis in T cells . In addition , these results suggest that T cells can be subcategorized on the basis of their intrinsic migratory capacity in relation to their activation . Motile and Non - motile Primary T cells also Revealed Higher Responsiveness to T cell Stimulation To further corroborate whether these biological characteristics of Jurkat T cells are reproducible in primary T cells , we established human and mouse motile and non - motile primary T cell lines in the same way . Similarly to the Jurkat m - T cells , human and mouse motile T cells ( Hm - T and Mm - T cells ) also showed an elongated phenotype with a polarized shape and higher responsiveness to chemokine ( Fig . 5A and 5E ) . In addition , there were basically no differences in terms of surface expression levels of the indicated proteins ( Fig . 5B and 5F ) . We next investigated random migration by using live chamber . As shown in Fig . 5C and 5G , both human and mouse motile T cells showed higher motility in response to SDF - 1 a than the non - motile T cells . We finally examined whether the differential motility and chemokine response observed in the two cell lines have any correlation to T cell activation . Compared Figure 2 .

Taken together , these results demonstrate that motile T cells had a better activation capability in response to activation signals than did non - motile T cells . Discussion In this study , we found that T cells can be subcategorized based on their inherent migratory capacity rather than the surface expression of specific differentiation - related markers . We charac - terized features of motile and non - motile T cells with respect to T cell activation . Interestingly , we observed that motile T cells exhibited elevated NF - k B activity through the PI3K - Akt signaling pathway and increased secretion of the cytokine IL - 2 in response to T - cell activation signals . Chemokines , in particular SDF - 1 a , signal through CXCR4 , a G - protein - coupled chemotactic receptor , and induce directional F - actin polymerization in the lamella region of migrating T cells [ 19 ] . Downstream of the CXCR4 , the regulation of F - actin polymerization depends on PI3K activation and PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P3 production , followed by the activation of protein kinase B ( Akt / PKB ) and GTPases [ 20 ] . These events are known to be coupled with morphological changes from round and symmetrical to a polarized or elongated phenotype and asymmetrical shape . In accordance with this , the motile T cells that we established in the current study showed typical features of motile lymphocytes that have thus far been well characterized . T cells are activated by several signaling pathways initiated from TCR and a co - receptor . The main signaling event is phosphor - ylation of immunoreceptor tyrosine - base activation motifs ( ITAMs ) on the cytosolic side of the TCR / CD3 complex by lymphocyte protein - tyrosine kinase ( Lck ) [ 21 ] . f - Chain - associated protein kinase ( ZAP - 70 ) is recruited to the TCR / CD3 complex where it is activated , promoting recruitment and phosphorylation of downstream adaptor or scaffold proteins [ 22 ] . A downstream second messenger , diacylglycerol ( DAG ) , activates PKC - h and the MAPK / ERK pathway , both promoting transcription factor NF - k B activation [ 23 ] , whereas IP 3 triggers the release of Ca 2 + from the ER , which promotes the entry of extracellular Ca 2 + into cells and finally promotes IL - 2 gene transcription through the tran - scription factor NF - AT [ 24 , 25 , 26 ] . The other additional signal CD28 simultaneously induces signal transduction by binding to PI3K , a family of complex enzymes with multifunctional roles [ 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 ] . Interestingly , CD28 signaling has previously been associated with the regulation of integrin - mediated T - cell adhesion as well as cytoskeletal reorganization [ 32 , 33 ] . In our present study , Jurkat motile T cells showed constitutive activation of PI3K and AKT , thereby suggesting that cellular migratory capacity , in part , clearly overlaps with activation capacity through the same signaling pathway in T cells . In this regard , it is well known that PI3K is activated by receptor and non - receptor protein tyrosine kinases and by G protein - coupled receptors on chemokine stimulation of migrating cells [ 34 ] . This CD28 - PI3K pathway ultimately triggers a number of downstream signaling molecules such as Akt and PKC - h and plays a critical role in driving cytokine production , proliferation , and survival . In our study , phosphorylation of PI3K was dramatically increased in Jurkat motile T cells ; consequently , Akt , a downstream target of PI3K , was also highly phosphorylated . In contrast , the activation profiles of ZAP70 and SLP76 , molecules involved in TCR - proximal - signaling pathway , were similar between Jurkat motile and non - motile T cells . This result clearly suggests that hyperactivation of motile T cells is induced not by the TCR - ZAP70 but by the CD28 - PI3K pathway . Consequently , high PKC - h activity by the PI3K - Akt pathway might induce NF - k B activation and contribute to IL - 2 production . There might be another reason that motile T cells show better activation capability than non - motile T cells do . Motile T cells have shown a polarity and that this polarized microenvironment provide sensitivity against stimulants . Furthermore , the leading edge of motile T cells might be more effective at engaging or aggregating receptors to generate an adequate signal ; therefore , we could hypothesize that higher cytokine production in motile cells might be caused by polarized molecules that effectively and sensitively induce signals from the membrane . Unexpectedly , in addition to TCR - mediated signaling , IL - 2 cytokine was produced at high levels by PMA / A23187 stimulation . These data suggest that not only polarity but also intracellular signaling in motile T cells is distinct from that in non - motile T cells . Indeed , expressions of NF - k B components , c - rel and p65 , were intrinsically higher in motile T cells than in non - motile T cells . In general , T cell motility is required for migration within the T cell zone and for making contact with APCs . Antigen recognition may depend on a stochastic process in which chance encounters take place between T cells and APCs . Therefore , two populations of T cells , phenotypically distinct with regard to their response to chemokine and migration capacity , may affect the initial screening for the antigen in the SLOs . In the current study , we added the concept that motility of T cells is also linked to the T cell activating potential even after antigen recognition . In this regard , it will be interesting to examine which of the T cell subsets shows similar or identical phenotypes of motile T cells in vivo . In our recent unpublished results , interestingly , we have noticed that ‘‘antigen - experienced’’ memory T cells are highly dynamic compared to naı¨ve T cells , even in the absence of chemokines . Although memory T cells respond more vigorously to stimulation and they are more sensitive to low doses of antigen than naive T cells , the molecular basis of this increased sensitivity remains unclear . Our current results suggest that rapid and strong response of memory T cells to the antigen may also be related to the motility of T cells . We , therefore , suggest that this motile population is a sort of specific subgroup and think that these two groups may have different intrinsic gene profiles . Global gene expression profiling is now carried out with motile and non - motile T cells with or without Figure 3 . The early events in the cell membrane are not a critical factor to determining hyperactivation in Jm - T cells .

On the other hand , motility may permit the escape of T cells from lymph nodes and be essential for their entrance into peripheral tissues to perform effector function after T cell activation . Our preliminary results of primary human or mouse T cells additionally demonstrated that motile T cells showed enhanced spontaneous transendothelial migration , sug - gesting that motile T cells in vivo may have infiltrating capacity into peripheral tissues or even inflammatory sites . The studies presented here are the first to show that motile T cells had a better activation capability in response to activation signals than did non - motile T cells . The PKC - h - NF - k B pathway followed by the PI3K - Akt axis is highly activated in m - T cells . In addition , these in vitro findings provide further insight into the reduction of inflammation by controlling recruitment and activation of effector T cells by tightly controlling PI3K - Akt activity and NF - k B signaling .
