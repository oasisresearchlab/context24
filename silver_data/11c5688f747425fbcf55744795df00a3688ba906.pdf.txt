Discriminant Dimensional Personality Inventory Among Owners with Special Reference to Small - scale Industries in Dindigul District , Tamil Nadu , India H . Samuel Thavaraj 1 and Well Haorei 1 Abstract Small - scale industries play an important role in the economic development of the country . In India more than 50 per cent of workforces are self - employed ( Thavaraj , 2012 , International Journal of Business Management & Research , 2 , 53 – 57 ) . In spite of its importance , the small - scale sector is beset with the problem of sickness . A personality inventory is an evaluation tool that helps people to learn about their personality types . Personality inventory can teach what occupation and work environment are a good fit for an individual and guides to choose the right career . The purpose of the research work is to iden - tify the dimensional personality inventory ( DPI ) variables that discriminates the owners of small - scale industries of ordinary ( profit - making ) units and highly sick units . The sample size of the study is 316 small - scale industrial units . The stratified proportionate random sampling technique was adopted to distribute the sample in the population . The researchers have used structured interview schedule to col - lect data from the respondents on their DPIs . It is revealed through this study that there are significant differences that are identified in the case of activeness , assertiveness , emotional stability , responsibility , decisiveness and leadership . The higher discriminant coefficients are identified in the case of emotional stability and leadership .

These industries encourage self - sufficiency , self - reliance and co - ordination . In spite of its importance , the small - scale sector is beset with the problem of sickness . An industrial unit may face a number of odds during its implementation and operation stage because of a number of factors in the environment—internal and external . The sick industries are unable to utilize the production capacity or produced goods and services . The sickness has been acute and adversely affecting production and employment in the country besides other socio - economic repercussions , so there is need to identify sickness in the initial stages and to initiate the process of corrective measures and revive / rehabilitation before the sickness assumes a serious proportion . A personality inventory is a self - evaluation tool that helps people to learn about their personality types . It reveals information about individuals’ social traits , inspirations , strengths , weaknesses and attitudes . Researchers believe that these factors play an important role in job satisfaction and career success . Personality inventory can teach us what occupation and work environment are a good fit for an individual and help us guide to choose the right career . It was also found that the most governing dimensions of the personality inventory are enthusiasm , sensitivity , leadership and optimism among the owners of small - scale industries ( Thavaraj , 2018 ) . In this study an effort is made by the researchers to identify the dimensional personality inventory ( DPI ) variables that discriminates the ordinary profit - making units and highly sick units among the owners of small - scale industries , so that the owners who do not possess the relevant entrepreneurial traits can be identify and directed towards other occupation or work environment that fits them the most , which would in turn lead to job satisfaction and success in their career . Dimensional Personality Inventory Singh ( 2002 ) developed ‘Singhs’ DPI which measures 10 dimensions of personality - decisiveness responsibility , emotional stability , masculinity , friendliness , ego - strength , dominance and self - concept . In the present study , the DPI is activeness , enthusiasm , assertiveness , trustiness , optimism , emotional stability , responsibility , friendliness and decisiveness . The DPI is described below : 1 . Activeness : The higher activeness results in higher personality ( Barrick & Mount , 1991 ) . 2 . Enthusiasm : This is indicated by the cyclothymiacs temperament ( Costa & Mc Care , 1992 ) . 3 . Assertiveness : The assertiveness of an individual indicates the honesty and transparency in all dealing of life of an individual ( Feist , 1998 ) . 4 . Trustiness : Trustiness indicates the level of trust made on others by an individual ( Goffin et al . , 1996 ) . 5 . Optimism : It indicates the feeling of helpfulness , hopefulness , worthiness and satisfied with the present and future ( Goldberg , 1990 ) . 6 . Emotional stability : The emotional stability shows the level of non - disturbance by the internal and external environment to the person ( Higgins , 1990 ) . 7 . Responsibility : It shows the responsibility taken by an individual in their life ( Dahl & Moreau , 2002 ) . 8 . Friendliness : The friendliness represents the positive mindset to interact with all people ( Judge & Bono , 2000 ) . 80 SEDME ( Small Enterprises Development , Management & Extension Journal ) 47 ( 1 ) 9 . Decisiveness : It shows the level of determination in all of their activities among the people ( Mount & Barrick , 1995 ) . 10 . Sensitivity : One of the personality inventory is sensitivity . It shows the listening and sensing the others feeling and events ( Robertson & Kinder , 1998 ) . 11 . Leadership : Leadership is one of the important personality inventory of the respondents ( Avolio et al . , 1999 ) . Literature Review Bulsara and Bhatt ( 2010 ) found that the important causes for industrial sickness are tough competition , mismanagement , higher cost of production , delay in administration , poor quality control and changes in technology . Kishor ( 2011 ) stated that the causes for industrial sickness are lack of experience , poor project planning under utilisation of funds , lack of financial management , time / cost overruns , location problems , technological choice and wrong assessment of the market . Elangbam and Prasain ( 2010 ) revealed the causes of sickness differ from industry to industry . The important causes of industrial sickness are internal and external causes . The internal causes are faulty project selection , marketing , financial , production , personnel and other problems , whereas the external problems are under or over financing by banks , delay in loan disbursement , delay in detection of sickness and delay in decision making . Objective of the Study The objective of the study is to identify the DPI variables that discriminates the owners of small - scale industries to establish as an ordinary ( profit - making ) unit and highly sick unit . Research Methodology The present study is confined to the owners of the small - scale industrial ( SSI ) units that are registered with the District Industries Centre ( DIC ) engaged in manufacturing process located in Dindigul District , Tamil Nadu , India . In total there are 4 , 380 SSI units registered with DIC ( Dindigul ) : service industries—1 , 215 units , manufacturing industries—1 , 516 units and not able to identify ( only owners name is provided ) —1 , 649 units . Sampling Procedure The sampling procedure consists of determination of sample size and sampling procedure . The sample size of the study is determined by 2 1 N n Ne = + where n = sample size Thavaraj and Haorei 81 N = population e = error of acceptance In the present study 2 1516 1516 316 . 45 . 4 . 79 1516 ( 0 . 05 ) 1 n = = = + The sample size of the study is 316 SSI units . The stratified proportionate random sampling technique was adopted to distribute the sample in the population . The random sampling method was adopted to select each sample in the population at each block . The researchers have used structured interview schedule to collect data from the respondents on their DPIs . Results and Discussion Discriminant DPI Among the Owners in ORU and HSU The DPI among the owners in ordinary units ( ORU ) and highly sicked units ( HSU ) may be differing . It is imperative to identify the important discriminant DPI variable among the owners in ORU and HSU for some policy implications . Initially , the mean difference among the two groups of owners regarding their DPI has been computed with its statistical significance . The Wilk’s Lambda of the DPI has been computed to examine the discriminant power of DPI . The results are given in Table 1 . Table 1 .

Note : Per cent of cases correctly classified : 83 . 39 . The significant mean differences are identified in the case of activeness , assertiveness , emotional stability , responsibility , decisiveness and leadership since their respective mean differences are significant at 5 per cent level . The higher mean differences are noticed in the case of leadership and assertiveness since their mean differences are 0 . 7304 and 0 . 7247 respectively . The higher discriminant power is identified in the case of leadership and assertiveness since its Wilks’ lambda is 0 . 1008 and 0 . 1011 , respectively . The significant DPI has been included for the estimation of discriminant functions . The unstandardized procedure has been followed to estimate it . The estimated function is : Z = 1 . 0311 + 0 . 1177 x 1 + 0 . 1304 x 3 + 0 . 2897 x 6 + 0 . 1033 x 7 + 0 . 1996 x 9 + 0 . 2145 x 11 The relative contribution of discriminant DPI in total discriminant score is identified with the help of the product of discriminant coefficient and the mean difference of the respective DPI . The results are presented in Table 2 . The higher discriminant coefficients are identified in the case of emotional stability and leadership since their discriminant coefficients are 0 . 2897 and 0 . 2145 , respectively . It shows the higher degree of influence of above said two DPI in discriminant function . The higher relative contribution in TDS is noticed in the case of emotional stability and leadership since their relative contribution is 25 . 55 and 23 . 45 per cent to the total , respectively . The estimated discriminant function correctly classifies the cases to the extent of 83 . 39 per cent . The analysis infers that the important discriminants DPI among the owner of ORU and HSU owners are emotional stability and leadership which is higher among the owners in ORU than the owners in HSU . Conclusion The analysis concludes that the most dominating discriminants DPI among the owners of ordinary units and highly sick units’ owners are emotional stability and leadership which is higher among the owners Thavaraj and Haorei 83 in ordinary units than the owners in highly sick units . This indicates that a high level of emotional intelligence and leadership capability plays an important role in the success among the owners of the small - scale industries . The educational institution or the government organisation has to evaluate the emotional intelligence level and the leadership talents among the potential individuals who aspire to start an enterprises and should provide adequate training and development to fine tune their ability so that the number of sick small - scale units can be minimized and pave way for the economic growth of the country .
