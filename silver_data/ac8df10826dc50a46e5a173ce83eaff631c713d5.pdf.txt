The Arp2 / 3 complex is an essential actin filament nucleator that nucleates both linear and branched actin filaments and is conserved across eukaryotes 1 , 3 . The complex exists in an inactive state until bound by NPFs that stimulate activating structural changes 4 – 11 . Two subunits in the Arp2 / 3 complex , Arp2 and Arp3 , are termed actin - related proteins ( Arps ) because of their homology to actin . Previous experiments suggest that during activation , Arp2 and Arp3 move into , or close to , the side - by - side arrangement of consecutive actin subunits along the short - pitch helical axis of an actin filament , hereafter called the short - pitch conformation 7 – 12 . In this position , Arp2 and Arp3 are thought to mimic a filamentous actin dimer , thereby creating a template for new filament assembly . In the inactive complex , however , Arp2 and Arp3 do not mimic a filamentous actin dimer 13 , 14 . Instead , two core subunits of the Arp2 / 3 complex , ARPC2 and ARPC4 , form a clamp that holds the Arps in an end - to - end ( splayed ) arrangement distinct from the short - pitch conformation . Furthermore , in the inactive complex , Arp2 and Arp3 adopt confor - mations that resemble unpolymerized actin monomers rather than filamentous actin subunits 15 , 16 . The structural differences between filamentous actin dimers and actin - related proteins in the inactive Arp2 / 3 complex suggest that both intra - and intersubunit changes within the complex are required to create a nucleation - competent state . However , the lack of a high - resolution structure of activated Arp2 / 3 complex has prevented an understanding of how NPFs trig - ger these changes . High - resolution structures of activated Arp2 / 3 complex have been unobtainable because the activated complex is recalcitrant to crystallization and tends to adopt limited orientations in vitri - fied ice during cryo - EM studies . Recently it was discovered that the WISH / DIP / SPIN90 ( WDS ) family of NPFs activate Arp2 / 3 complex to nucleate linear actin filaments 3 , which are more ame - nable to single - particle cryo - EM studies than the branched actin filaments created during activation by other NPFs . Furthermore , unlike WASP family NPFs , WDS proteins remain associated with Arp2 / 3 complex at the pointed end of the actin filament after nucle - ation 17 , making it possible to capture the activated , NPF - bound state . Taking advantage of these biochemical properties , we deter - mined by cryo - EM the near - atomic resolution structure of activated S . pombe Arp2 / 3 complex bound to its nucleated actin filament and the S . pombe WDS protein , Dip1 . The structure provides a snapshot of the activated conformation of Arp2 / 3 complex and reveals the conformational pathway by which NPFs drive activation . Results Structure solution . To create short actin filaments capped with Dip1 - bound Arp2 / 3 complex for single - particle reconstruction , we mixed Dip1 with Arp2 / 3 complex and monomeric actin to nucleate new filaments and added capping protein to block barbed - end elon - gation . Optimized reactions produced many short linear filaments with knobs of density corresponding to Arp2 / 3 complex at one end ( Extended Data Fig . 1a , b ) . From these samples we obtained a ~ 3 . 9 Å resolution reconstruction of Dip1 bound to activated Arp2 / 3 com - plex , with the complex anchored to the pointed end of the filament that it nucleated ( Fig . 1a , b , Extended Data Figs . 1b – d , 2a and 3a , c – l and Table 1 ) . The structure contains the first four actin subunits ( n , n + 1 , n + 2 and n + 3 ) in the nucleated actin filament . The first two actins ( n and n + 1 ) are attached to the barbed end of the Arps ( Figs . 1a and 2a ) . To understand the structural changes that occur during activa - tion , we also determined a ~ 4 . 2 Å resolution structure ( Fig . 1c ) of the inactive S . pombe Arp2 / 3 complex using a tilted cryo - EM data collection methodology 18 ( Extended Data Figs . 1e – h , 2b and 3b and Table 1 ) . This structure is nearly identical to those of the inactive Arp2 / 3 complex from Bos taurus 13 , 19 ( Extended Data Fig . 4 ) . Arp2 and Arp3 adopt the short - pitch conformation upon activa - tion . Previous low - resolution EM reconstructions and biochemical / biophysical assays suggested that Arp2 and Arp3 move into or near the short - pitch conformation during activation 8 – 12 , but the struc - tural rearrangements that allow these subunits to trigger nucleation have remained unclear . Cryo - EM reveals the transition of Arp2 / 3 complex from inactive to nucleation - competent state Mohammed Shaaban 1 , Saikat Chowdhury 1 ✉ and Brad J . Nolen 2 ✉ Arp2 / 3 complex , a crucial actin filament nucleator , undergoes structural rearrangements during activation by nucleation - promoting factors ( NPFs ) . However , the conformational pathway leading to the nucleation - competent state is unclear due to lack of high - resolution structures of the activated state . Here we report a ~ 3 . 9 Å resolution cryo - EM structure of activated Schizosaccharomyces pombe Arp2 / 3 complex bound to the S . pombe NPF Dip1 and attached to the end of the nucle - ated actin filament . The structure reveals global and local conformational changes that allow the two actin - related proteins in Arp2 / 3 complex to mimic a filamentous actin dimer and template nucleation . Activation occurs through a clamp - twisting mechanism , in which Dip1 forces two core subunits in Arp2 / 3 complex to pivot around one another , shifting half of the complex into a new activated position . By showing how Dip1 stimulates activation , the structure reveals how NPFs can activate Arp2 / 3 complex in diverse cellular processes . NAtuRE StRuCtuRAl & MolECulAR BioloGy | www . nature . com / nsmb Articles Nature Structural & Molecular Biology In the active structure we present here , we find that the Arps form a short - pitch heterodimer that closely mimics the filamen - tous short - pitch actin dimer ( Fig . 2a , b , Extended Data Fig . 5 and Supplementary Video 1 ) . Arp2 is rotated ~ 9° about an axis orthogo - nal to the filament axis ( Fig . 2b ) , but remains in close contact with Arp3 ( ~ 450 Å 2 buried ) . This contrasts with the low - resolution EM reconstruction of the branch junction , in which Arp3 and Arp2 are separated by a wide gap 12 . The 9° rotation of Arp2 does not cause long - range distortions in the nucleated filament , because the actin subunits in the Dip1 – Arp2 / 3 – filament structure show helical parameters similar to those reported in high - resolution cryo - EM structures of actin filaments ( Fig . 2a ) 15 , 16 . Besides creating a filament - like Arp2 – Arp3 heterodimer , movement of Arp2 into the short - pitch conformation releases Arp2 from its splayed ( inactive ) position at the barbed end of Arp3 ( Fig . 2c ) . This rearrangement frees the barbed end of Arp3 to interact with the first actin subunit ( n ) in the nucleated actin filament , and is one of multiple structural changes that trigger activation . Flattening of the Arps gates interactions with the first actin sub - units . While intersubunit structural changes in Arp2 / 3 complex jux - tapose the Arps like two consecutive subunits along the short - pitch helical axis of a filament , intrasubunit changes within the Arps are also important to create the nucleation - competent state . During activation , both Arps undergo a scissor - like rotation of their small domain ( subdomains 1 and 2 ) relative to their large domain ( subdo - mains 3 and 4 ) that moves them from a twisted toward a flattened conformation ( Fig . 2d , e ) . This conformational change also occurs in actin following incorporation into filaments , and is important for facilitating both long - and short - pitch interactions between filamentous actin subunits 15 , 16 , 20 . In the activated structure , Arp2 flattens to the same extent as polymerized actin subunits ( Fig . 2d and Extended Data Fig . 6a ) . In contrast , Arp3 flattens only partially , adopting a conformation between the structures of monomeric ver - sus filamentous actin subunits ( Fig . 2e and Extended Data Fig . 6a ) . However , partial flattening allows Arp3 to bury ~ 200 Å 2 more sur - face area and make increased interactions with Arp2 that mimic the actin – actin short - pitch interface ( Extended Data Fig . 6b – d ) . At the Arp – actin long - pitch interfaces , three structural features from the pointed end of each actin subunit insert into three cor - responding creases in the barbed ends of the Arps , making interac - tions analogous to long - pitch interactions between actin subunits in a filament 15 , 16 ( Fig . 3 ) . Conformational changes at the barbed ends of the Arps that occur concurrently with flattening are important in facilitating a subset of these interactions . Specifically , flattening promotes insertion of the D loop of actins n and n + 1 into the crease between subdomains 1 and 3 in the Arps , called the barbed - end groove ( BEG ) ( Extended Data Fig . 7a , b ) . Flattening of the Arps is accompanied by uncurling of the W loop in subdomain 3 , which opens a hydrophobic pocket in the BEG that accommodates Met44 of the actin D loop ( Extended Data Fig . 7a – d and Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . Flattening also rotates a trio of residues that line the subdo - main 1 side of the BEG into position to make a hydrophobic pocket that binds Val45 in the actin D loop ( Extended Data Fig . 8a , b and Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . Finally , flattening pulls the C terminus of both Arps away from the front of the BEG ( Extended Data Fig . 8a – c ) . The C terminus of Arp3 is five residues longer than in actin and includes hydrophobic residues that pin it to the BEG in some inac - tive structures 7 . In this position , the Arp3 C terminus would block the D loop of actin monomer n from interacting with the Arp3 barbed end during activation ( Extended Data Fig . 8b ) . By pulling the C - terminal extension out of the groove , flattening may allow the D loop from monomer n to bind , thereby permitting nucleation . Nucleotide - binding state of the Arps in activated Arp2 / 3 complex . In the active structure , both the Arp3 and Arp2 nucleotide - binding clefts show density consistent with ATP ( Fig . 4 ) . In Arp3 the nucleo - tide density is weaker than in Arp2 , but density that could be attrib - uted to the γ - phosphate is present in both Arps . In contrast , all four actin subunits in the reconstruction appear to have hydrolyzed their bound ATP and released the γ - phosphate ( Fig . 4 ) . The appar - ent density for the γ - phosphate of ATP in the Arp nucleotide clefts is consistent with previous biochemical experiments showing that ATP hydrolysis is not required for activation 21 , 22 . The presumed stability of ATP in the Arp3 cleft could be caused by the intermediate conformational state of Arp3 .

NAtuRE StRuCtuRAl & MolECulAR BioloGy | www . nature . com / nsmb Articles Nature Structural & Molecular Biology measurements in the active site suggest that partial flatten - ing of Arp3 fails to fully rotate Gln160 Arp3 into position near the γ - phosphate of ATP , where it is thought to position the hydrolytic water molecule 23 ( Fig . 4c , d ) . It is important to note that the limited resolution of the map increases the uncertainty of these measure - ments ( Extended Data Fig . 9a , b ) . Arp2 , on the other hand , flattens as much as filamentous actin subunits and its equivalent glutamine , Gln137 Arp2 , rotates into its proposed activated position within the nucleotide - binding cleft ( Fig . 4d , e ) . However , in Arp2 the ATP is pushed deeper in the nucleotide - binding pocket , into a position that probably prevents the γ - phosphate from aligning properly with Gln137 Arp2 , His161 Arp2 and the catalytic water molecule for hydroly - sis ( Extended Data Fig . 9c ) . Previous data showed that WASP - mediated branching nucle - ation stimulates ATP hydrolysis on Arp2 , and probably also on Arp3 , to trigger branch destabilization and actin network disassem - bly 21 , 22 , 24 , 25 . Given that Arp2 hydrolyzes ATP seconds after branch - ing nucleation 24 , we expected ATP to be hydrolyzed on Arp2 , and possibly also Arp3 , in our structure of Dip1 - activated Arp2 / 3 com - plex , because we aged filaments for tens of minutes to hours before plunge - freezing to image them . The apparent presence of ATP in Arp2 and Arp3 of the Dip1 - activated Arp2 / 3 complex suggests that Dip1 may not trigger rapid ATP hydrolysis following activa - tion . Given the role of ATP hydrolysis in destabilizing branches , this biochemical feature could contribute to the stability of Dip1 bound to activated Arp2 / 3 complex on the pointed end of nucleated actin filaments 17 . Twisting of the clamp rotates a block of subunits into the short - pitch conformation . The structures we present here not only reveal the key features of the nucleation - competent state , but they also show how Arp2 / 3 complex switches to this state . To adopt the short - pitch conformation , the complex undergoes a dramatic con - formational rearrangement in which the center of mass of Arp2 moves 20 . 5 Å relative to its position in inactive structures ( Fig . 2c ) . A previously proposed ‘clamp - release model’ hypothesized that to reach this state , Arp2 releases from the clamp subunits ( ARPC2 and ARPC4 ) —which remain rigid—and rebinds in a new position that approximates the short - pitch conformation 12 . This model pre - dicts that Arp2 will make a distinct set of contacts with the clamp in the short - pitch state compared to the splayed state . By contrast , a second model , based on computational studies , suggested that Arp2 maintains its contacts with the clamp during activation but that the clamp twists to move Arp2 into the short - pitch confor - mation 26 . The Dip1 – Arp2 / 3 – filament structure is incompatible with the clamp - release model , since Arp2 makes identical contacts to the clamp in the inactive and active conformations ( Extended Data Fig . 10a ) . Furthermore , we find that the clamp itself is not rigid during the activation process , a prerequisite of the clamp - release model . Instead , during activation the clamp twists , rotating its bottom half along with a large block of subunits that includes Arp2 , the globular portion of ARPC4 , ARPC1 and ARPC5 , to bring Arp2 into the short - pitch position ( Fig . 5a , b , Extended Data Fig . 10b and Supplementary Video 2 ) . The twist axis runs parallel to the long helices in the clamp and rotates the block of subunits by ~ 19° ( Fig . 5b ) . To trigger clamp twisting , Dip1 binds the center of the clamp along a long helix that extends from the globular portion of the ARPC4 subunit ( Fig . 5c ) . Its binding mode is similar to the human WDS protein , SPIN90 , bound to the inactive Arp2 / 3 complex observed in a recent crystal structure 27 . In the active structure we present here , Dip1 remains braced against the globular domain of ARPC4 but changes its register with the extended helix in ARPC4 to pack more tightly against it ( Fig . 5c – e ) . This allows Dip1 to serve as a wedge that bends the helix and pushes it away from the globular domain of ARPC4 ( Fig . 5c – e and Extended Data Figs . 3l and 10b ) . Bending of the extended ARPC4 helix triggers the ~ 19° - clamp twist that rotates Arp2 into the short - pitch conformation . Bending of this helix also appears to indirectly stimulate the intrasubunit domain rotation that partially flattens Arp3 because—once moved into the short - pitch conformation—flattening of Arp3 increases its interac - tions with Arp2 ( Extended Data Fig . 6 ) .

NAtuRE StRuCtuRAl & MolECulAR BioloGy | www . nature . com / nsmb Articles Nature Structural & Molecular Biology Discussion While WASP family NPFs bind to different sites on Arp2 / 3 com - plex than Dip1 ( refs . 6 , 11 , 27 – 30 ) , biochemical and low - resolution struc - tural data suggest that , like Dip1 , WASP stimulates the movement of Arp2 into the short - pitch conformation 3 , 8 – 11 . Based on the flex - ibility of the clamp we observed here and the requirement to move the Arps into the short - pitch conformation during activation 31 , we expect that clamp twisting is a general feature of activation triggered by WASP and other NPFs . Given that diverse NPFs regulate Arp2 / 3 complex across a broad range of biological functions 32 , we believe this conformational change to be a key step in controlling actin assembly in many different cellular processes . Besides clamp twisting and adoption of the short - pitch confor - mation , the structure of activated Arp2 / 3 complex reveals the other conformational changes required for activation and , along with pre - viously published data , allows us to propose a structural pathway for actin filament nucleation ( Fig . 6 ) . In the inactive complex , the Arp2 and Arp3 subunits adopt a splayed arrangement . This conformation is stabilized by intersubunit interactions between the Arps and by their interactions with the clamp 7 ( Extended Data Fig . 10a ) . In the inactive conformation , the barbed ends of the Arps are not config - ured to make strong long - pitch interactions with actin monomers and Arp2 sterically blocks the barbed end of Arp3 , thus preventing nucleation . The clamp - twisting conformational change induced by Dip1 binding during activation disrupts the inactive arrangement of the Arps and moves Arp2 into the short - pitch conformation , thereby permitting association of actin monomers with the nascent filament . Intrasubunit changes are also important for activation , and the activated structure shows that flattening causes structural rear - rangements at the barbed ends of both Arps that allow them to make increased long - pitch interactions with actin ( Fig . 6 ( states 3 and 4 ) and Extended Data Figs . 7 and 8 ) . Some of these changes— including W - loop uncurling and realignment of the two sides of the barbed - end groove—occur in both activated Arps and polym - erized actin subunits 15 , 16 , thereby constituting an evolutionarily S en s o r l oop Q137 H161 T12 D154 P1loop P2loop S en s o r l oop Q160 H192 T14 D185 P1 loop P2loop ATP ?

NAtuRE StRuCtuRAl & MolECulAR BioloGy | www . nature . com / nsmb Articles Nature Structural & Molecular Biology conserved conformational switch that controls assembly . As in Arp3 , residues in the C - terminal tail of both actin and Arp2 are pulled out of the barbed - end groove and toward the filament heli - cal axis during flattening ( Extended Data Fig . 8 ) . However , it is currently unclear whether , like Arp3 , movement of the relatively short C - terminal tails in Arp2 or actin during flattening gates their long - pitch interactions with actin subunits . Disorder in inactive structures makes it unclear whether the C terminus is sufficiently long and positioned correctly to block interactions of the D loop of an incoming actin monomer with the barbed - end groove in these proteins 16 , 19 . How Dip1 and other WDS proteins activate Arp2 / 3 complex without a pre - existing actin filament while WASP proteins can - not remains a key unresolved question , because this biochemical property allows WDS proteins to initiate the assembly of branched actin networks 3 , 33 , 34 . We postulate that a key difference between these two NPFs is rooted in the mechanism by which they stim - ulate the short - pitch conformation . While WDS proteins activate through their interactions with the clamp , WASP binds to two sites far from the clamp 6 , 8 , 11 , 28 – 30 , 35 ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . At these sites , the Arp2 / 3 - interacting segment in WASP , WASP - CA , engages the complex to stimulate the short - pitch conformation while the WASP V region recruits actin monomers to the complex 6 , 8 , 11 , 28 – 30 , 35 , 36 . The activated structure presented here , along with structural and bio - chemical data on WASP 6 , 8 , 11 , 28 – 30 , 35 , indicate that the WASP - C segment blocks the D loops of the first two actin subunits ( n and n + 1 ) from inserting into the barbed - end grooves of the Arps ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . These observations suggest that bound WASP blocks proper association of its recruited actin subunits with the barbed ends of the Arps . Therefore , while bound WASP , like Dip1 , stimulates the short - pitch conformation 3 , 8 – 10 , it probably blocks subsequent acti - vating steps . This hypothesis is supported by recent observations showing that WASP must be released before nucleation 37 , and also by the observation that when Arp2 / 3 complex is crosslinked into the short - pitch conformation it is inhibited by WASP - CA 8 . We speculate that by stimulating the short - pitch conformational change without blocking filament - like interactions with the first actin monomers , WDS proteins allow activation to proceed without Arp2 / 3 com - plex binding to actin filaments . During WASP - mediated branching nucleation , actin filaments may stimulate WASP release from the nascent branch junction to allow nucleation , but the precise role of actin filaments during WASP - mediated activation remains a key unresolved question . In conclusion , the structure of activated Arp2 / 3 complex bound to its nucleated actin filament provides a new structural context for interpretation of over two decades of biophysical and biochemical studies , while also providing the foundation for future experiments aimed toward understanding how the highly conserved Arp2 / 3 complex nucleates actin filaments in response to different cellular signals . – 56 . 4° – 37 . 1° Arp3 Arp2 ARPC5 ARPC4 ARPC2 ARPC1 ARPC3 Dip1 Arp3 ARPC2 ARPC4 Arp3 Arp2 Inactive Active a b Inactive Active H5 - 2 H6 - 2 α D α D 239 247 155 147 ( SPIN90 ) ARPC4 239 247 155 147 Dip1 ARPC4 α D ARPC4 H5 - 2 H6 - 2 6 . 2 Å 9 . 4 Å 8 . 0 Å 6 . 6 Å Inactive Active Inactive Active N ′ 138 . 8˚ 132 . 8˚ c d e Arp3 Arp2 R205ARPC2 Y275 R158 D278 L151 V281 K150 E148 D143 R288 D284 R247 D145 Fig . 5 | Dip1 bends the ARPC4 long helix to twist the clamp and rotate a block of subunits into the short - pitch conformation . a , Comparison of active and inactive Arp2 / 3 complex structures .

In state 1 , Arp2 / 3 complex is in an inactive state with the barbed end of Arp3 blocked by Arp2 and the barbed - end grooves ( labeled BEG in state 2 ) are not properly arranged for interaction with actin . Dip1 binds to the clamp ( red dashed outline in state 1 ) to stimulate clamp twisting and movement of Arp2 into the short - pitch conformation ( states 2 to 3 ) . Arp2 in the short - pitch conformation triggers partial flattening of Arp3 , which opens up the Arp3 barbed - end groove for optimal long - pitch interactions with actin n ( states 3 to 4 ) . Steps 4 and 5 show that the actin monomer n flattens and stimulates flattening of Arp2 following binding to the complex ; however , it is possible that formation of the nucleus requires binding of additional actin monomers to the nascent filament . Dip1 binds tightly to activated Arp2 / 3 complex on the pointed end of the actin filament 17 ( state 6 ) , unlike WASP , which must be released for nucleation to proceed .

Rabbit skeletal muscle actin was extracted from acetone powder ( Pel Freeze , catalog no . 41995 ) by stirring in G - buffer ( 20 ml g – 1 , 2 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 ) on ice for 30 min before spinning in a Beckman JA - 20 rotor at 16 , 000 r . p . m . for 30 min at 4 °C . Supernatant containing actin monomers was filtered through glass wool . The pellet was resuspended in the original volume of G - buffer and the extraction , centrifugation and filtration steps were repeated . Actin was polymerized from the combined supernatant by the addition of KCl to 50 mM and MgCl 2 to 2 mM final concentrations and stirred on ice for 1 h . Additional KCl was then added to bring the final concentration of KCl to 0 . 8 M . After 30 min , the solution was centrifuged for 2 h in a Ti70 rotor at 31 , 700 r . p . m . to pellet the polymerized actin filaments . The pellet was gently washed with G - buffer and resuspended in G - buffer in a proportion of 3 ml g – 1 of the starting stock of acetone powder . Actin was then diluted to 5 mg ml – 1 and dialyzed for 2 d with three changes of G - buffer to depolymerize the actin filaments . The solution was then clarified by centrifugation in a Ti90 rotor at 36 , 000 r . p . m . for 2 h , and actin was purified by size exclusion chromatography over a Sephacryl S - 300 column equilibrated with G - buffer containing 1 mM sodium azide . Fractions were stored on ice and used for experiments within 1 week . The concentration of actin was measured by absorbance using an extinction coefficient of 26 , 000 M − 1 cm − 1 at 290 nm . Dip1 was purified as described previously 3 . Briefly , Dip1 was overexpressed as a glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) fusion in Escherichia coli using the pGV67 - Dip1 plasmid . Cells were homogenized and the lysate was clarified by centrifugation . The clarified lysate was run over a Glutathione Sepharose affinity column and eluted with reduced glutathione . The protein was then dialyzed overnight at 4 °C with tobacco etch virus ( TEV ) protease then loaded onto a resource Q column in 20 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 50 mM NaCl and 1 mM DTT before elution with a 50 – 500 - mM NaCl gradient . The protein was then concentrated and loaded onto a Superdex 200 gel filtration column . The concentration of Dip1 was measured by absorbance using an extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 36 , 330 M − 1 cm − 1 . Schizosaccharomyces pombe Arp2 / 3 complex was purified as previously described 34 . Briefly , S . pombe cells were lysed in a Microfluidics Model M - 110EH - 30 Microfluidizer and the lysate was clarified before the addition of 0 . 243 g ml – 1 ammonium sulfate to the supernatant over 30 min with stirring . After 30 min , the pellet was resuspended in PKME ( 25 mM PIPES pH 6 . 8 , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM EGTA , 3 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT and 0 . 1 mM ATP ) then dialyzed overnight against the same buffer before addition to a Glutathione Sepharose column charged with GST - N - WASP - VCA . The Arp2 / 3 complex was eluted using a gradient of PKME with a total of 150 – 1 , 000 mM KCl . Pooled fractions were then run on a Mono Q column equilibrated in 10 mM PIPES pH 6 . 8 , 25 mM NaCl , 0 . 25 mM EGTA and 0 . 25 mM MgCl 2 and eluted with a gradient of 25 – 500 mM NaCl . The dialysate was concentrated and loaded on a Superdex 200 gel filtration column equilibrated with Tris pH 8 . 0 , 50 mM NaCl and 1 mM DTT . The final concentration was determined by measuring absorbance at 290 nm using an extinction coefficient at 290 nm of 139 , 030 M − 1 cm − 1 , and then the protein was aliquoted and flash - frozen . His - tagged mouse capping protein ( alpha - 1 , beta - 2 ) in a pRSF Duet vector ( a gift from D . Kovar ) was overexpressed in E . coli . Cells were lysed in 50 mM NaH 2 PO 4 pH 8 . 0 , 500 mM NaCl , 10 % glycerol , 10 mM imidazole and 10 mM β - mercaptoethanol with protease inhibitor tables . The lysate was run over a Talon Metal Affinity resin ( Clontech , no . 635501 ) and eluted with lysis buffer containing 250 mM imidazole . Peak fractions were dialyzed overnight against 20 mM Tris pH 8 . 5 , 50 mM NaCl , 5 % glycerol , 0 . 01 % NaN 3 and 1 mM DTT , then loaded onto a resource Q column , washed and eluted with a salt gradient of 50 – 500 mM NaCl . Pure protein was dialyzed into storage buffer ( 20 mM HEPES , 1 mM EDTA pH . 8 . 0 , 200 mM KCl , 0 . 01 % NaN3 , 10 % glycerol and 1 mM DTT ) before flash - freezing . GST - Wsp1 - VCA was overexpressed in E . coli , the cells lysed and the lysate run over a Glutathione Sepharose column in 20 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 140 mM NaCl , 2 mM EDTA and 2 mM DTT . The GST tag was cleaved on the column by the addition of TEV protease and overnight incubation at 4 °C with gentle inversion . The NaCl concentration was reduced to 100 mM by dilution and loaded on a Mono Q column , washed and eluted with a gradient of 100 – 500 mM NaCl . Pooled fractions were concentrated and loaded on a Superdex 75 gel filtration column . The concentration was measured using absorbance at 280 nm and an extinction coefficient of 5 , 690 M − 1 cm − 1 before flash - freezing . Sample preparation for cryo - EM . To generate filaments capped on their pointed ends by the Dip1 - bound Arp2 / 3 complex , we mixed 1 . 0 μ M S . pombe Arp2 / 3 complex , 5 . 0 μ M Dip1 , 1 . 0 μ M Wsp1 - VCA , 9 . 0 μ M rabbit skeletal muscle actin monomers and 0 . 6 μ M mouse capping protein in a buffer containing 50 mM KCl , 1 mM EGTA , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 20 mM HEPES pH 7 . 5 and 1 mM DTT at room temperature . To keep the filaments short , we added all components except actin monomers and capping protein first , then spiked in one - third of the desired final capping protein and actin monomers to 1 . 4 μ M . After polymerization for 20 min , we added additional actin monomers to bring the total actin concentration to 2 . 3 μ M . This process was repeated eight additional times to maintain a relatively low concentration of unpolymerized actin monomers throughout the reaction . The remaining capping protein was added ( one - third at a time ) just before the third and seventh actin monomer addition steps . After the final addition of actin , the reaction was incubated for 20 min before the addition of phalloidin to a final concentration of 10 μ M . For the inactive Arp2 / 3 complex sample , we attempted to form coassemblies of Arp2 / 3 complex and Dip1 by mixing on ice 1 . 0 μ M S . pombe Arp2 / 3 complex and 3 . 0 μ M Dip1 in a buffer containing 50 mM NaCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM ATP , 10 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 and 1 mM DTT . Only the Arp2 / 3 complex per se , but no Dip1 – Arp2 / 3 complex assemblies , was resolved by both two - dimensional ( 2D ) and three - dimensional ( 3D ) classification during cryo - EM image processing . The same grid vitrification procedure was used for both samples : 4 μ l of sample was applied to a freshly glow - discharged 300 - mesh UltrAuFoil R1 . 2 / 1 . 3 holey Gold grid ( Quantifoil ) . Excess sample was manually blotted off with a dry Whatman no . 1 filter paper for 5 – 7 s . Immediately after the blotting step , the sample containing the grid was rapidly vitrified by plunge - freezing in liquid ethane at − 179 °C . The entire cryo - grid preparation process was carried out in a cold room at 4 °C and 98 % relative humidity , to minimize excessive evaporation of sample from the grid surface . Cryo - EM data acquisition . Cryo - EM data were acquired on a 200 - kV Talos Arctica transmission electron microscope equipped with a Falcon 3EC direct electron detector ( Thermo Fisher ) . The automated data acquisition software EPU ( Thermo Fisher ) was used for data collection . For the Dip1 - activated Arp2 / 3 – actin complex , each micrograph was collected as dose - fractionated videos consisting of 45 fractions per video and at a nominal magnification of × 92 , 000 . This corresponded to a physical pixel size of 1 . 12 Å per pixel for each micrograph . The total exposure time per micrograph was 60 s and the total exposure was 36 . 35 e − / Å 2 ( 0 . 81 e − per fraction ) . Data were collected underfocused with a nominal defocus range between − 1 . 00 and − 1 . 75 µ m ( Extended Data Fig . 1a ) . Electron micrographs of the inactive Arp2 / 3 complex were collected using a previously described tilted data acquisition method 18 . Micrographs were acquired by tilting the grids to angles of 20° , 30° and 40° . Additionally , data were collected without tilting of the grids . All data were collected at a nominal magnification of × 120 , 000 , corresponding to a size of 0 . 8757 Å per pixel , with nominal defocus ranging from − 0 . 7 to − 1 . 3 µ m ( Extended Data Fig . 1e ) . Each micrograph was collected as a dose - fractionated video consisting of 62 fractions over 40 s exposure and a total exposure of 44 . 34 e – 1 / Å 2 ( 0 . 72 e − 1 per fraction ) . Cryo - EM data processing . In total , 5 , 109 micrographs were collected for the Dip1 - activated Arp2 / 3 – actin complex ( Extended Data Fig . 1a ) . Beam - induced motion correction and per - fraction radiation damage compensation over spatial frequencies ( dose - weighting ) were performed using the motion - correction algorithm implemented in the RELION v . 3 . 0 . 6 suite ( henceforth referred to as RELION ) 38 . Contrast transfer function ( CTF ) estimation for the micrographs from aligned and summed fractions was estimated using the program Gctf 39 . Based on the results for CTF estimation , we discarded 661 micrographs with poor confidence of fit or that were severely astigmatic . From the 4 , 448 remaining micrographs , particles were picked using the automated Laplacian Gaussian picking program implemented in RELION . This resulted in 3 . 5 million picked particles , which were extracted from micrographs using a square box size of 304 pixels and further binned to a box size of 76 pixels ( voxel size of 4 . 48 Å per pixel ) . These particles were subjected to multiple rounds of 2D classification . In total , 2 , 346 , 578 particles belonging to 2D classes of the Arp2 / 3 complex capped pointed ends ( Extended Data Fig . 1b ) were selected for further processing . Using these particles , an ab initio 3D reference volume was created using cryoSPARC v . 2 ( ref . 40 ) . This volume was used as initial reference for 3D processing . Multiple iterations of 3D refinements , followed by 3D classifications without alignment ( clustering ) , were performed to isolate the best resolving 3D volume . Following this , 125 , 359 particles from 3D classes representing the Arp2 / 3 capped pointed ends of actin filaments were then recentered and re - extracted as unbinned particles ( 304 pixels per box , 1 . 12 Å per pixel ) . Initial 3D refinement with this unbinned stack of particles resulted in a resolution map of 4 . 3 Å . Three - dimensional binary masks for data processing were created using the 3D reference volume of the complex as template and expanding it by eight pixels , along with Gaussian smoothing across ten pixels . For more accurate per - particle CTF estimation , CTF refinement within RELION was performed . Particles were also subjected to per - particle motion correction by Bayesian polishing 41 . These polished particles were subjected to 3D refinement using a mask , resulting in reconstruction at 4 . 1 - Å resolution . The 3D refined particle stack was subjected to three - class clustering . A total of 110 , 433 particles belonging to the best 3D class were selected and subjected to further 3D refinement . The final refined map was at a resolution of 3 . 9 Å ( at 0 . 143 Fourier shell correlation ( FSC ) ) ( Extended Data Fig . 3a ) . Because the cap and filament regions were flexible relative to each other , we decided to improve the quality of maps for these subregions by performing signal - subtraction - based focused refinement 42 ( Extended Data Fig . 2a ) . Both subregions had the Arp2 and Arp3 subunits in common . To rebuild the composite map , focused maps for the two regions were first fitted to a nonfocused map of the full complex , with the Arp2 and Arp3 subunits as the overlapping subunits between the two maps . The composite map was then generated by retaining the maximum valued voxel at each location from the two maps using the ‘vop maximum’ function within UCSF NAtuRE StRuCtuRAl & MolECulAR BioloGy | www . nature . com / nsmb Articles Nature Structural & Molecular Biology Chimera 43 ( Extended Data Figs . 2a and 1c , d ) . Local resolution of the map was estimated using RELION’s local resolution estimation program ( Extended Data Fig . 1c ) . The final map was sharpened by applying a B factor of – 45 . 12 Å ( ref . 2 ) during the postprocessing step in RELION . The inactive Arp2 / 3 complex data were processed using CryoSPARC v . 2 . 12 . 4 ( ref . 40 ) ( Extended Data Fig . 2b ) . A total of 5 , 309 micrographs , consisting of videos , were collected with and without tilting and subjected to full - frame motion correction followed by patch - motion correction ( Extended Data Fig . 1e ) . CTF parameters were estimated locally using the patch CTF - estimation program . An automated Gaussian - based blob picker was used to pick all the particles from the micrographs , and 3 , 336 , 981 picked particles were then extracted from the micrographs using a square box of 368 pixels ( 0 . 8757 Å per pixel ) . These particles were subjected to multiple rounds of 2D classification . After exclusion of particles belonging to classes having nonparticle features and aggregates , 450 , 747 particles representing different views of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Extended Data Fig . 1f ) were selected for 3D processing . These selected particles were then subjected to another round of local - motion correction to more accurately correct per - particle drift . These particles were then subjected to three - class ab initio 3D reconstructions . In total , 185 , 772 particles belonging to the intact inactive Arp2 / 3 complex class were subjected to homogeneous refinement . To further separate heterogeneity , these particles were subjected to 3D classification by heterogenous refinement ; 112 , 170 particles belonging to well - resolved , inactive Arp2 / 3 complex 3D class were finally refined using a static binary 3D mask , which resulted in a final reconstruction of 4 . 2 Å ( at 0 . 143 FSC ) ( Extended Data Figs . 1g , h and 2b ) . Local resolution estimation and sharpening of the map was performed in RELION using the two unfiltered half maps ( Extended Data Fig . 1f ) . The final map was sharpened by application of a B factor of − 116 . 219 Å ( ref . 2 ) . Model building and analysis . The final maps generated from 3D reconstructions mentioned above were used for atomic model building of each of the complexes . Structures of S . pombe inactive Arp2 / 3 complex lacking the Arp2 subunit ( PDB 3DWL ) and F - actin subunits from rabbit ( Oryctolagus cuniculus ) ADP - actin filament ( PDB 3J8I ) , were used as initial templates for atomic model building . Ab initio computational models for the S . pombe Arp2 and Dip1 subunits were generated using the RaptorX 44 ( http : / / raptorx . uchicago . edu / StructPredV2 / predict / ) and I - TASSER 45 ( https : / / zhanglab . ccmb . med . umich . edu / I - TASSER / ) protein structure prediction servers . These models were initially rigid - body fitted into the maps using the ‘fit map’ function in UCSF Chimera 43 . Flexible fitting of the models into their respective maps was performed using the Namdinator web server ( https : / / namdinator . au . dk ) 36 . Amino acid registers , backbone and side chain geometries for the models were manually fixed using Coot 46 . Density corresponding to the ARPC3 subunit was poor , due to structural flexibility . The model for this region was truncated to C β and rigid - body fitted into the map . In our active structure of Arp2 / 3 complex , we were able to build residues 235 – 366 of full - length Dip1 because the remainder of the Dip1 molecule was missing from the density map . Repeated rounds of model fixing using Coot and real - space refinement in Phenix 47 were performed to fix all model geometries . Regions lacking side chain densities were truncated to C β stubs and , for those regions where the density was missing or extremely broken , the polypeptide chain was deleted in the model . Accurate pixel size for the map was determined using the EMBuilder program 48 . The final corrected pixel size for the Dip1 - bound Arp2 / 3 complex – actin filament map was 1 . 11 Å and the pixel size for the inactive Arp2 / 3 complex remained unchanged . Model validations were performed using both the Molprobity server ( http : / / molprobity . biochem . duke . edu / ) 49 and the PDB Validation Service server ( www . wwpdb . org ) 50 . All figure and video creation was performed using UCSF Chimera 33 and UCSF ChimeraX 43 . The degree of flattening of Arp2 , Arp3 or actin was measured using the angle 𝜑 . This angle was determined by treating the center of mass of each of the four subdomains as a point in a dihedral definition . The centers of mass of each subdomain were calculated using backbone atoms within the following subdomain definitions : S . pombe Arp3 ; 6 – 32 , 94 – 169 , 384 – 417 ( Subdomain 1 ) ; 33 – 37 , 74 – 93 ( Subdomain 2 ) ; 170 – 212 , 306 – 355 , 371 – 382 ( Subdomain 3 ) ; 213 – 293 ( Subdomain 4 ) ; B . taurus Arp3 ; 6 – 32 , 78 – 153 , 375 – 408 ( Subdomain 1 ) ; 33 – 37 , 60 – 77 ( Subdomain 2 ; 154 – 196 , 295 – 344 , 362 – 374 ( Subdomain 3 ) ; 197 – 282 ( Subdomain 4 ) ; S . pombe Arp2 ; 4 – 30 , 71 – 146 , 348 – 385 ( Subdomain 1 ) ; 31 – 35 , 52 – 70 ( Subdomain 2 ) ; 147 – 181 , 273 – 322 , 335 – 347 ( Subdomain 3 ) ; 182 – 261 ( Subdomain 4 ) ; B . taurus Arp2 ; 7 – 33 , 74 – 150 , 352 – 387 ( Subdomain 1 ) ; 34 – 38 , 55 – 73 ( Subdomain 2 ) ; 151 – 185 , 277 – 326 , 339 – 351 ( Subdomain 3 ) ; 186 – 265 ( Subdomain 4 ) ; O . cuniculus actin ; 6 – 32 , 71 – 146 , 337 – 373 ( Subdomain 1 ) ; 33 – 37 , 52 – 70 ( Subdomain 2 ) ; 147 – 181 , 273 – 336 ( Subdomain 3 ) ; and 182 – 261 ( Subdomain 4 ) . Distance x 1 , which measures intrasubunit flattening ( Extended Data Fig . 6a ) , was defined by the following pairs of atoms : S . pombe Arp3 : Y92 C α to K235 C α ; B . taurus Arp3 : Y76 C α to E222 C α ; S . pombe Arp2 : Y69 C α to E207 C α ; B . taurus Arp2 : Y72 C α to E211 C α ; O . cuniculus actin : Y69 C α to E207 C α . Distance x 2 , which measures opening / uncurling of the W loop ( Extended Data Fig . 7d ) , was defined by the following pairs of atoms : S . pombe Arp3 : V159 C α to Y200 C α ; B . taurus Arp3 : V143 C α to Y184 C α ; S . pombe Arp2 : I136 C α to V169 C α ; B . taurus Arp2 : I140 C α to F173 C α ; O . cuniculus actin : I136 C α to Y169 C α . Distance x 3 , which measures the position of the C terminus relative to the barbed - end groove ( Extended Data Fig . 8 ) , was defined by the following pairs of atoms : S . pombe Arp3 : L179 C α to R418 C α ; B . taurus Arp3 : L163 C α to R409 C α ; S . pombe Arp2 : S148 C α to D383 C α ; B . taurus Arp2 : L152 C α to E387 C α ; O . cuniculus actin : T148 C α to H371 C α . Distance x 4 measures the distance between the catalytic glutamine and the γ - phosphate ( Fig . 4d ) . This distance was measured between the γ - phosphate and the following residues : S . pombe Arp3 , Q160 ; B . taurus Arp3 , Q144 ; S . pombe Arp2 , Q137 ; B . taurus Arp2 , Q141 ; O . cuniculus actin , Q137 . For distances x 1 , x 2 and x 3 the following structures were used : ( 1 ) Arp2 and Arp3 from all available structures of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( PDB 1K8K , 1TYQ , 1U2V , 2P9I , 2P9K , 2P9L , 2P9N , 2P9P , 2P9S , 2P9U , 3DXK , 3DXM , 3DWL , 3RSE , 3UKU , 3UKR , 3ULE , 4JD2 and 6DEC ( refs . 14 , 19 , 28 , 35 , 51 – 53 ) , and the inactive and activated structures presented here ) . Because subdomains 1 and 2 of Arp2 are disordered in most of these structures , fewer data points could be generated for the Arp2 subunit . ( 2 ) Two representative actin monomer X - ray crystal structures in either the ADP - or tATP - bound state ( PDB 1NWK and PDB 2J6Z ) 54 , 55 . ( 3 ) The highest - resolution cryo - EM structures of actin filaments with subunits in the ADP - , ADP - Pi - or AMP - PNP - bound states 15 , 16 . In Fig . 4d , in addition to the activated structure presented , distance x 4 was measured in the following structures : PDB 4JD2 , 2P9K , 1TYQ , 3ULE , 3DWL , 2P9S , 2P9U , 1ATN , 1NWK , 2A40 , 2A42 , 2HBT , 6DJM and 5OOE . For analysis of the surface area buried at the interfaces in Extended Data Fig . 6c , coordinate files were processed using the Dockprep module in Chimera to add missing side chains and were then submitted to the PISA protein interaction server ( https : / / www . ebi . ac . uk / msd - srv / prot _ int / cgi - bin / piserver ) 43 , 56 . The clamp - twist angle for Fig . 5b was defined as either the dihedral between Arg32 C α ( ARPC4 ) , Ser 147 C α ( ARPC4 ) , Ile262 C α ( ARPC2 ) and Arg18 C α ( ARPC2 ) in the S . pombe Arp2 / 3 complex or the homologous residues in the Bt Arp2 / 3 complex . The ARPC4 α D helix bend angle in Fig . 5c was defined using either Lys130 C α , Asp143 C α and Ser166 C α in the Sp Arp2 / 3 complex or the homologous residues / atoms in the Bt Arp2 / 3 complex . In Fig . 2c the inactive Arp2 / 3 complex structure was overlaid on subdomains 1 and 2 of Arp3 in the activated structure to show movement of Arp2 . In Fig . 5a , the activated and inactive Arp2 / 3 complexes were superposed using subdomains 1 and 2 of Arp3 and the globular portion of ARPC2 . In Fig . 5d , the α D helix of ARPC4 from each structure was superposed . Reporting Summary .
