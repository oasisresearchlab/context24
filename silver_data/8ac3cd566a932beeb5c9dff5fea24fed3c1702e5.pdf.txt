HSPC migration out of the BM is a critical process that underlies modern clinical stem cell transplantation . Here we demonstrate that enforced HSPC egress from BM niches depends critically on the nervous system . UDP - galactose ceramide galactosyltransferase - deﬁcient ( Cgt (cid:1) / (cid:1) ) mice exhibit aberrant nerve con - duction and display virtually no HSPC egress from BM following granulocyte col - ony - stimulating factor ( G - CSF ) or fucoidan administration . Adrenergic tone , osteoblast function , and bone CXCL12 are dysregu - lated in Cgt (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice . Pharmacological or genetic ablation of adrenergic neurotrans - mission indicates that norepinephrine ( NE ) signaling controls G - CSF - induced osteo - blast suppression , bone CXCL12 down - regulation , and HSPC mobilization . Further , administration of a b 2 adrenergic agonist enhances mobilization in both control and NE - deﬁcient mice . Thus , these results indi - cate that the sympathetic nervous system regulates the attraction of stem cells to their niche . INTRODUCTION Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells ( HSPCs ) reside in speciﬁc niches that control survival , proliferation , self - re - newal , or differentiation in the bone marrow ( BM ) . Stem cells closely associate with spindle - shaped N - cadherin - and An - giopoietin - 1 - expressing osteoblasts that line the endosteal bone ( Calvi et al . , 2003 ; Zhang et al . , 2003 ; Arai et al . , 2004 ) . In normal individuals , the continuous trafﬁcking of HSPCs between the BM and blood compartments likely ﬁlls empty or damaged niches and contributes to the mainte - nance of normal hematopoiesis ( Wright et al . , 2001 ; Abko - witz et al . , 2003 ) . Although it has been known for many years that the egress of HSPCs can be enhanced by multiple ag - onists , the mechanisms that regulate this critical process are largely unknown . The hematopoietic cytokine granulocyte - colony stimulat - ing factor ( G - CSF ) is widely used clinically to elicit HSPC mo - bilization for life - saving BM transplantation and has thus served as the prototype to gain mechanistic insight about this phenomenon ( Lapidot and Petit , 2002 ; Papayannopou - lou , 2004 ) . While mice deﬁcient in the G - CSF receptor ( G - CSFR (cid:1) / (cid:1) ) are unresponsive to G - CSF stimulation , G - CSFR (cid:1) / (cid:1) HSPCs can be elicited by G - CSF in chimeric mice that harbored mixtures of G - CSFR + / + and G - CSFR (cid:1) / (cid:1) hematopoietic cells , suggesting the contribution of ‘‘ trans - acting’’ signals ( Liu et al . , 2000 ) . Subsequent studies have suggested that these trans - acting signals originated from the release of proteases , including serine - and metallo - pro - teinases , whose substrates include various molecules impli - cated in progenitor trafﬁcking such as VCAM - 1 ( Levesque et al . , 2001 ) , membrane bound Kit ligand ( Heissig et al . , 2002 ) , the c - Kit receptor , stromal - derived factor - 1 ( SDF - 1 or CXCL12 ) ( Petit et al . , 2002 ; Levesque et al . , 2003 ) , and its cognate receptor , CXCR4 ( Levesque et al . , 2003 ) . Among these , the CXCL12 - CXCR4 axis has emerged as a likely ef - fectorbecauseitisthesolechemokine - receptorpaircapable Cell 124 , 407 – 421 , January 27 , 2006 ª 2006 Elsevier Inc . 407 of attracting HSPCs ( Wright et al . , 2002 ) , and its disruption is sufﬁcient to induce mobilization ( Broxmeyer et al . , 2005 ) . However , the function of these proteases has been chal - lenged by other data , indicating that G - CSF - induced mobi - lization was normal in mice lacking virtually all neutrophil ser - ine protease activity , even when combined with a broad metalloproteinase inhibitor ( Levesque et al . , 2004 ) . This sug - gests that other proteases and / or other mechanisms are involved . We and others have previously shown that the sulfated fu - cose polymer fucoidan can rapidly elicit HSPC mobilization ( Frenette and Weiss , 2000 ; Sweeney et al . , 2000 ) . We were intrigued by the similar biological characteristics of fu - coidan , which is synthesized by certain seaweeds , and sul - fatide , a sulfated galactolipid synthesized by mammalian cells ( Roberts et al . , 1986 ; Skinner et al . , 1991 ; Waddell et al . , 1995 ) . The synthesis of sulfatide and its nonsulfated form , galactosylceramide ( GalCer ) , is initiated by the addition of UDP - galactose to ceramide in a reaction mediated by UDP - galactose : ceramide galactosyltransferase ( Cgt ) , an en - zyme highly expressed in oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells ( Sprong et al . , 1998 ) . The products of Cgt , collectively referred to as galactocerebrosides ( GCs ) , are a major com - ponent of the myelin sheaths that facilitate the transmission of saltatory conduction ( Norton and Cammer , 1984 ) . Pre - dictably , Cgt (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice display defects in nerve conduction and die on postnatal days 18 – 30 from severe tremor and ataxia ( Bosio et al . , 1996 ; Coetzee et al . , 1996 ) . We initially hypothesized that sulfatide contributed to the signals mediating HSPC mobilization . During the course of these studies , we found that Cgt (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice exhibit defects in postnatal lymphopoiesis owing to speciﬁc deﬁcits in stromal elements that support the growth and differentiation of lym - phoid precursors ( Katayama and Frenette , 2003 ) . Here , we report that Cgt (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice fail to mobilize BM HSPCs following G - CSF stimulation . Unexpectedly , the deﬁcit is not due to the absence of BM sulfatide but likely originates from altered neural inﬂuence on osteoblasts . Indeed , we show that sig - nals emanating from the sympathetic nervous system sup - press osteoblast function and control the attraction of stem cells to their niche . RESULTS Mobilization Is Severely Impaired in Cgt (cid:1) / (cid:1) Mice Cgt littermates were treated with G - CSF to elicit HSPCs from the BM . Strikingly , there was little mobilization in Cgt (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice compared to Cgt + / (cid:1) or + / + littermates ( Figure 1A ) . The reduc - tionofcirculatingHSPCsin Cgt (cid:1) / (cid:1) micewasnotduetolower numbers of progenitors ( Figure 1B ) or stem cells ( Figure 1C ; see Katayama and Frenette , 2003 forcompetitive reconstitu - tion ) in the BM . However , the number of common lymphoid progenitor ( CLP ) cells ( Kondo et al . , 1997 ) was signiﬁcantly reduced in Cgt (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice compared to Cgt + / + littermates ( Figure 1C ) , indicating that the previously reported block in lymphoid differentiation ( Katayama and Frenette , 2003 ) oc - curs before the CLP stage . To exclude the possibility that the lymphopenic state contributed to the impaired mobiliza - tion in Cgt (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice , we injected G - CSF in Rag1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) and IL7R a (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice , which have broad deﬁcits in B and T cells . Circulating CFU - Cs were elicited at levels similar to those of wild - type mice ( data not shown ) , indicating that the mobiliza - tion defect in Cgt (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice is unrelated to lymphopenia . If fucoidan promoted HSPC mobilization by mimicking the function of endogenous sulfatide , we would expect that its administration in Cgt (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice might rescue the mobi - lization defect . To test this possibility , we treated Cgt litter - mates with fucoidan and assayed for circulating HSPCs . We found that CFU - Cs were not mobilized by fucoidan in Cgt (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice ( Figure 1D ) , suggesting that Cgt expression is necessary for mobilization triggered by either fucoidan or G - CSF . The Mobilization Defect Originates from the Stromal Compartment It has been reported that HIV - 1 entry into human intestinal epithelial cell lines can be blocked by either anti - GalCer or anti - CXCR4 mAbs , suggesting that CXCR4 can cooperate with GalCer during the fusion process ( Delezay et al . , 1997 ) . We assessed the migration of Cgt (cid:1) / (cid:1) BM mononu - clear cells toward CXCL12 to investigate whether the mobi - lization defect arose from CXCR4 dysfunction on Cgt (cid:1) / (cid:1) he - matopoietic cells . However , Cgt (cid:1) / (cid:1) and + / + cells did not differ in CXCL12 - mediated migration ( Figure 1E ) . To evaluate further whether the defect in HSPC mobiliza - tion observed in Cgt (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice could originate from hemato - poietic cells , Cgt + / + or (cid:1) / (cid:1) BM nucleated cells ( BMNCs ; CD45 . 2 + ) were transplanted into lethally irradiated wild - type CD45 . 1 congenic mice . G - CSF - induced mobilization was similar for highly chimeric ( > 95 % of donor type ) Cgt + / + and (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice ( Figure 1F ) . Thus , these results indicate that the mobilization defect cannot be transferred through the transplantation of BM - derived hematopoietic cells . G - CSF - Induced Bone Marrow Proteolytic Activity Is Preserved in Cgt (cid:1) / (cid:1) Mice Previous studies have revealed that G - CSF induces proteo - lytic activity in the extracellular BM microenvironment and that the released proteases , most notably neutrophil elas - tase , may play an important role in mobilization ( Petit et al . , 2002 ; Levesque et al . , 2003 ) . We found that neutrophil elas - tase activity in supernatants from phorbol - myristate acetate ( PMA ) - activated BMNCs was similar for Cgt + / + and (cid:1) / (cid:1) litter - mates ( Figure 1G ) , suggesting that Cgt (cid:1) / (cid:1) BMNCs have a normal capacity to produce and release this serine prote - ase . To evaluate more globally the proteolytic environment in Cgt (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice , recombinant CXCL12 was incubated with BM extracellular ﬂuid ( BMEF ) derived from PBS / BSA or G - CSF - treated mice , and the degradation of recombinant CXCL12 was assessed by immunoblotting . A slight deg - radation of CXCL12 by BMEF was observed in PBS / BSA - treated mice , but no change was observed for Cgt + / + and (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice ( Figure 1H , lanes 2 and 4 ) , suggesting a normal productionofproteolyticenzymesinthe Cgt (cid:1) / (cid:1) BMmicroen - vironment under basal conditions . Consistent with previous reports ( Petit et al . , 2002 ; Levesque et al . , 2003 ) , CXCL12 408 Cell 124 , 407 – 421 , January 27 , 2006 ª 2006 Elsevier Inc . protein was completely degraded after incubation with BMEF from G - CSF - treated Cgt + / + mice ( Figure 1H , lane 3 ) , and complete degradation also occurred with BMEF from G - CSF - treated Cgt (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice ( Figure 1H , lane 5 ) . Thus , mobi - lization is impaired in Cgt (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice despite normal proteolysis in the BM . CXCL12 Is Expressed in Bone CXCL12 has been reported to be expressed by endothelial cells and osteoblasts using immunohistochemical staining of human BM samples , but the positively stained area was limited and sporadic ( Ponomaryov et al . , 2000 ; Petit et al . , 2002 ) . Knockin mice expressing GFP driven within the c xcl12 locus exhibited a speckled distribution of ﬂuorescent stromal cells in the BM ( Tokoyoda et al . , 2004 ) . We ﬁrst per - formed standard immunoﬂuorescence staining of CXCL12 in frozen sections of wild - type mouse BM but found no speciﬁc staining , likely due to the very low levels of CXCL12 in the BM ( ng range in an entire femur ) ( Petit et al . , 2002 ; Levesque et al . , 2003 ) . However , staining using the tyramide ampliﬁca - tion system revealed a speciﬁc speckled staining in the BM parenchyma and , unexpectedly , strong and consistent staining in bone ( Figures 2A – 2F ) . Bone CXCL12 was not re - stricted to the endosteal region , a putative location of the stem cell niche ( Calvi et al . , 2003 ; Zhang et al . , 2003 ) , but was distributed throughout the entire thickness . To conﬁrm further the staining speciﬁcity , we compared the expression of CXCL12 between BMEF and protein extracts from bone by ELISA . Total CXCL12 was in fact higher in bone extracts than in BMEF ( Figure 2G ) , indicating that bone tissues are a major reservoir of CXCL12 . To assess whether CXCL12 in bone was cell or matrix associated , we stained for CXCL12 and CD44 , an osteocyte marker , but found no ev - idence of colocalization of the CXCL12 signal with osteo - cytes ( Figures 2H and 2I ) . However , primary osteoblasts and the osteoblast precursor cell line ST2 express high levels of CXCL12 ( Ponomaryov et al . , 2000 and data not shown ) , indicating that CXCL12 is likely deposited in the bone matrix by osteoblasts but not osteocytes . Decreased CXCL12 Expression in Bone Correlates with Mobilization CXCL12 levels decrease in BMEF during mobilization , and this effect has been suggested to induce cell egress . There - fore , we have determined CXCL12 levels by ELISA in the compact bone as well as in the BMEF of Cgt littermate micetreatedwitheithercontrolPBS / BSAorG - CSF . Wecon - ﬁrmed that CXCL12 was greatly reduced in Cgt + / + and + / (cid:1) BMEF after G - CSF injection ( Figure 3A ) . Unexpectedly , the CXCL12 protein in Cgt (cid:1) / (cid:1) BMEF was also signiﬁcantly reduced by G - CSF ( Figure 3A ) , despite the fact that these mice do not mobilize HSPCs . While CXCL12 also decreased in the bone of normal littermate mice following G - CSF ad - ministration ( Figure 3B ) , there was no reduction of CXCL12 protein levels in the bone of Cgt (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice . These results indi - cate that CXCL12 levels in bone may correlate better than that of BM with the release of HSPCs . G - CSF - Induced Transcriptional Downregulation of CXCL12 While proteases can clearly degrade CXCL12 in vitro , the maintenance of bone CXCL12 levels in Cgt (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice despite a robust BM proteolytic activity suggests the contribution of other regulatory mechanisms . To assess whether CXCL12 is regulated at the transcriptional level , we evaluated the ex - pression of the two major isoforms of CXCL12 ( a and b ) by quantitative real - time RT - PCR ( Q - PCR ) in bone and BM tis - sues of Cgt littermates . The mRNA expression of both CXCL12 isoforms was profoundly decreased in BM after G - CSF in both Cgt (cid:1) / (cid:1) and normal littermates ( Figures 3C and 3D ) . CXCL12 mRNA levels in bone were moderately de - creased after G - CSF treatment ( p < 0 . 05 for CXCL12 a , p = 0 . 06 for CXCL12 b ) . Although there was a trend toward de - creased CXCL12 transcripts in Cgt (cid:1) / (cid:1) bone after G - CSF , the difference was not signiﬁcant , and mRNA levels were still higher in G - CSF - treated Cgt (cid:1) / (cid:1) bone than those of steady - state normal littermates ( Figures 3C and 3D ) . Thus , CXCL12 is transcriptionally regulated in both BM and bone tissues . Blunted transcriptional downregulation in Cgt (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice may contribute to the sustained CXCL12 protein levels in Cgt (cid:1) / (cid:1) bone . Osteoblast Activity Is Altered in Cgt (cid:1) / (cid:1) Mice We noted during the staining of osteocytes ( Figures 2H and 2I ) that bone lining osteoblasts in Cgt (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice were generally ﬂatwithlittle cytoplasmand shortprojectionsintobone , while osteoblastsfromlittermatecontrolsdisplayedahomogenous cobblestone - like appearance sending numerous and deep projections into the bone matrix ( Figures 4A and 4B ) . The os - teoblast function was also altered in Cgt (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice since plasmaosteocalcin levels were signiﬁcantly reduced ascom - pared with normal littermates ( Figure 4C ; 39 % reduction , n = 6 – 9 , p < 0 . 001 ) . However , the number of apoptotic osteo - blasts in Cgt (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice , as determined by TUNEL assay , was not increased ( data not shown ) . Further , the absence of Cgt expression was not directly responsible for the osteo - blast dysfunction since Cgt mRNA was not detected in vari - ous osteoblast lineage cells ( Figure 4D ) . To conﬁrm the ab - sence of Cgt expression in osteoblastic cells , we cultured MC3T3 - E1 and ST2 cell lines with ascorbic acid for 18 days to induce further maturation . Even under these differentiating conditions , no Cgt mRNA was detectable ( Figures S1A and S1B ) . These results thus suggest that osteoblast function is altered in Cgt (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice through an indirect mechanism . G - CSF Suppresses Osteoblast Activity Considering the suppression of osteoblast activity in Cgt (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice and the fact that osteocalcin levels have been reported to be reduced after G - CSF administration ( Takamatsu et al . , 1998 ; Froberg et al . , 1999 ) , we reasoned that HSPC mobili - zation by G - CSF may be caused by a rapid downregulation in osteoblast activity . We evaluated the effect of G - CSF administration on the expression of Runx2 , a transcription factor controlling osteoblast function and a 1 ( I ) collagen , a major osteoblast gene product and component of the bone matrix . The expression of both genes was dramatically Cell 124 , 407 – 421 , January 27 , 2006 ª 2006 Elsevier Inc . 409 410 Cell 124 , 407 – 421 , January 27 , 2006 ª 2006 Elsevier Inc . downregulated by G - CSF administration in the bone marrow of Cgt + / + mice ( Figures 4E and 4F ; levels of Runx2 ; 65 % re - duction , n = 4 , p < 0 . 001 , a 1 ( I ) collagen ; 92 % reduction , n = 4 , p < 0 . 05 ) . However , in Cgt (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice , the steady - state levels of Runx2 and a 1 ( I ) collagen tended to be lower than control littermate mice , and the downregulation following G - CSF administration was not as marked ( Figures 4E and 4F ) . Strikingly , bone - lining osteoblasts in G - CSF - treated age - matched wild - type C57BL / 6 mice resembled those from steady - state Cgt (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice ( Figure 4G ) and exhibited a ﬂattened appearance with shorter projections into the bone matrix ( Figure 4H ) . Since osteoblasts do not express G - CSFR ( Figure 4I ) , these results indicate that G - CSF suppresses osteoblast activity through an indirect mecha - nism . Signals from the Sympathetic Nervous System Trigger G - CSF - Induced Mobilization Since Cgt (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice have severe neurological abnormalities ( Coetzee et al . , 1996 ; Bosio et al . , 1996 ) , we explored the possibility that signals emanating from the nervous system participate in HSPC mobilization . This possibility would be consistent with data showing that adrenergic stimulation re - duces bone formation , indicating that bone formation and osteoblast function are regulated by the sympathetic ner - vous system ( SNS ) ( Takeda et al . , 2002 ) . To test this hypoth - esis , we disrupted catecholaminergic neurons by serial peri - natal injections of 6 - hydroxydopamine ( 6OHDA ) ( Iversen et al . , 1994 ) . 6OHDA treatment severely reduced the tissue content of catecholamines ( Table S1 ) . We found that the number of HSPCs mobilized by G - CSF was dramatically re - duced in 6OHDA - lesioned mice compared to littermates in - jected with vehicle control ( Figure 5A ) , even though 6OHDA did not alter baseline CFU - C counts per bone ( Figure 5B ) . Strikingly , baseline bone - lining osteoblast morphology was similar between control and 6OHDA - treated mice ( Figures 5C and 5E ) . By contrast , G - CSF suppressed osteoblasts from control mice but not from 6OHDA - treated littermates ( Figures 5D and 5F ) . Neonatal administration of 6OHDA damages both central and peripheral , dopaminergic and noradrenergic , neurons , owing to the permeable blood - brain barrier of newborn mice . To distinguish between the two catecholaminergic pathways , we studied mice deﬁcient in dopamine b - hydro - xylase ( Dbh (cid:1) / (cid:1) ) , the enzyme necessary for the conversion of dopamine into norepinephrine ( NE ) ( Thomas et al . , 1995 ) . G - CSF - triggered mobilization of CFU - Cs ( Figure 6A ) and the stem cell - enriched fraction ( Lin (cid:1) Sca - 1 + c - kit + cells ; Figure 6B ) was dramatically compromised in Dbh (cid:1) / (cid:1) com - pared to Dbh + / (cid:1) littermates , indicating that noradrenergic neurons were required for mobilization by G - CSF . Immuno - histological analyses of osteoblasts also revealed that mor - phology correlated with the effectiveness of G - CSF to induce mobilization , in that osteoblasts from G - CSF - treated Dbh + / (cid:1) mice exhibited a ﬂattened appearance and shorter projec - tions , whereas little change was observed in Dbh (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice ( Figures 6C – 6F ) . In addition , CXCL12 was reduced in bone protein extracts from Dbh + / (cid:1) mice following G - CSF adminis - tration , whereas CXCL12 levels were maintained in Dbh (cid:1) / (cid:1) animals ( Figure 6G ) . Additionally , treatment of C57BL / 6 mice for three weeks with a b blocker ( propranolol ) signiﬁ - cantly reduced ( > 20 % ) the number of HSPCs elicited by G - CSF ( Figure 6H ) . To evaluate whether the mobilization defect in Dbh (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice could be rescued by the administra - tion of a b 2 adrenergic agonist , we treated a separate cohort of Dbh + / (cid:1) and Dbh (cid:1) / (cid:1) animals with clenbuterol 2 days be - fore and during G - CSF administration . Clenbuterol rescued in part the mobilization defect in Dbh (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice and , interest - ingly , further enhanced mobilization in Dbh + / (cid:1) controls ( Fig - ure 6I ) . By contrast , administration of clenbuterol , by itself , at the same dose schedule did not trigger mobilization ( data not shown ) , suggesting that b 2 adrenergic signaling is not down - stream of but rather cooperates with other signals from the G - CSF receptor . G - CSF Acts outside the Central Nervous System Recent studies have revealed that G - CSF can cross the blood brain barrier and that the G - CSFR is widely expressed by neurons in the central nervous system ( CNS ) ( Schneider et al . , 2005 ) . That signals from the SNS originating from the hypothalamus can suppress bone formation also sug - gests the possibility of a G - CSF target in the CNS ( Takeda et al . , 2002 ) . To address this issue , we stereotaxically im - planted guide cannulae into lateral ventricles of C57BL / 6 mice . One week after implantation , mice received G - CSF ei - ther directly in the CNS by intracerebroventricular ( ICV ) infu - sion or systemically by s . c . injection . As shown in Figure 7A , robust HSPC mobilization occurred only when mice were Figure 1 .

Since 6OHDA does not penetrate the CNS of adult mice and causes transient damage of pe - ripheral noradrenergic neurons ( Livnat et al . , 1985 ) , we also evaluated whether G - CSF elicited mobilization in adult 6OHDA - lesioned mice . We found that mobilization was sig - niﬁcantly reduced in 6OHDA - treated adult mice ( Figure 7B ) , conﬁrming that a disruption of noradrenergic neurons arising from peripheral sympathetic ganglia is sufﬁcient to impair the egress of HSPC . NE in peripheral tissues is synthesized and stored in sym - pathetic nerve endings . In response to sympathetic nerve impulses , NE is released in the extracellular milieu to interact with its receptor target ( s ) and is then degraded or recycled . If G - CSF augmented NE release or disrupted its reuptake , we might expect a reduction in NE levels in tissues . To investi - gate this possibility , we measured NE by HPLC in hearts and bones of steady - state and G - CSF - treated C57BL / 6 mice . While cardiac NE levels in mice that received a single dose of G - CSF were slightly reduced , we found a dramatic Figure 2 .

Thus , taken to - gether , these data suggest that G - CSF - induced adrenergic signals emerging from the peripheral nervous system regu - late the egress of stem / progenitor cells from their bone mar - row niche ( Figure 7D ) . DISCUSSION Regulated CXCL12 Expression in Bone Several studies have suggested that a CXCL12 chemokine gradient between BM and blood , modiﬁable by secreted proteases , plays a key role in HSPC mobilization ( Levesque et al . , 2002 ; Petit et al . , 2002 ) . That HSPC mobilization was virtually absent in Cgt (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice despite robust proteolytic ac - tivity in the BM led us to investigate alternative expression and regulation of CXCL12 . Our studies suggest that CXCL12 is expressed at high levels in bone tissues and that bone CXCL12 is dysregulated in Cgt (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice following G - CSF administration . CXCL12 staining in bone matrix was speciﬁc , as shown by appropriate antibody controls and by conﬁrmation with a sandwich ELISA . The fact that ﬂuores - cence staining in bone was not reported in knockin mice ex - pressing GFP under the CXCL12 locus is likely due to differ - ential sorting mechanisms for GFP and CXCL12 ( Tokoyoda et al . , 2004 ) . In addition , these results are consistent with a recent report documenting the presence of CXCL12 in bone ( Sun et al . , 2005 ) . Although osteocytes represent the major cell type present in bone , they do not appear to synthesize CXCL12 . Indeed , no colocalization between CXCL12 and osteocyte staining Figure 3 .

K . and P . S . F . , unpublished data ) . BM CXCL12 has been re - ported to be expressed by endothelial cells , osteoblasts , and other stromal elements ( Ponomaryov et al . , 2000 ; To - koyoda et al . , 2004 ) . The presence of high concentrations of CXCL12 in bone and its striking downregulation with G - CSF - induced osteoblast suppression strongly suggest that it is primarily deposited by osteoblasts , like many other growth factors that are enriched in bone matrix ( Hauschka et al . , 1988 ) . Indeed , recent studies suggest that BM CXCL12 is largely produced by osteoblasts ( Semerad et al . , 2005 ) . Despite reduced osteoblastic activity , CXCL12 levels Figure 5 . 6OHDA Treatment Reveals a Critical Role for Catecholaminergic Neurons in G - CSF - Mediated Osteoblast Suppression and HSPC Mobilization ( A ) Catecholaminergic lesions were induced early postnatally with 6 - hydroxydopamine ( 6OHDA ) or vehicle s . c . injections , and CFU - Cs were elicited by G - CSF after weaning .

Whereas CXCL12 is constitutively expressed in a variety of tissues and is necessary for vascular development , intriguing data have suggested that certain cytokines ( e . g . , TGF - b and TNF - a ) can decrease CXCL12 transcript levels in stromal and ﬁbroblastic cell lines via yet unidentiﬁed mechanisms ( Fedyk et al . , 2001 ; Wright et al . , 2003 ) . TNF - a was a prime contender to mediate osteoblast suppression because it is reported to inhibit Runx2 , a 1 ( I ) collagen , and osteocalcin ( Nanes , 2003 ) and to be essential for CXCL12 downregula - tion in the BM during immunization ( Ueda et al . , 2004 ) . How - ever , it is unlikely that TNF - a contributes to HSPC mobiliza - tion since G - CSF administration does not alter TNF - a mRNA levels in the BM and , more importantly , TNF - a - deﬁcient mice mobilize normal numbers of HSPCs ( Y . K . and P . S . F . , un - published data ) . Whether Runx2 , a key transcription factor that controls the expression of multiple osteoblast genes , in - ﬂuences the expression of CXCL12 is being tested in the lab - oratory . We have found no evidence that soluble GCs are involved in the survival , growth , or function of osteoblasts since ( 1 ) neither osteoblasts ( Figure 4 ) nor hematopoietic cells ( Ka - tayama and Frenette , 2003 ) express the Cgt gene ; ( 2 ) neither the lymphopoietic nor the HSPC mobilization phenotype are transplantable ( Katayama andFrenette , 2003and Figure 1F ) ; ( 3 ) GCs are not detectable in BMEF or mouse serum ; ( 4 ) al - though Cgt mRNA can be detected by Q - PCR in BM and bone , GCs are not detectable by high performance thin layer chromatography , even when alkali - stable lipid extracts from more than 2 femurs are loaded ( Figures S2A – S2C ) . Thus we believe that the low expression level of Cgt in these organs originates from Schwann cells that support the transmission of neuronal signals . Neuronal Regulation of the Stem Cell Niche Neural control of bone metabolism , both trophic and atro - phic , has been suggested by numerous experimental and clinical observations . A rich network of nerve ﬁbers was de - scribed in bone and bone marrow tissues with a signiﬁcant subset of ﬁbers reaching stromal cells ( Calvo , 1968 ; Yama - zaki and Allen , 1990 ) . Immunolabeling studies have revealed a close association between glutamate - , catecholamine - , or peptide - containing nerve ﬁbers and osteoblasts or osteo - clasts in the endosteum ( Hohmann et al . , 1986 ; Serre et al . , 1999 ; Takeda et al . , 2002 ) . Blockade of glutamate re - ceptors was reported to reduce the DNA binding activity and expression of Runx2 in cultured osteoblasts ( Hinoi et al . , 2003 ) .

On the other hand , hyperadrenergic activity and osteopenia are characteristic signs of a human disease commonly referred to as reﬂex sympathetic dystrophy . Ther - apeutic sympathectomy was formerly used to decrease the discrepancies in limb length in children affected with polio - myelitis , underscoring the possibility of a dual effect of bone innervation on bone formation ( Ring , 1961 ) . The effect of the sympathetic nervous system on bone formation has only recently been elucidated using genetic models ( Chien and Karsenty , 2005 ) . These studies revealed that leptin in - duced bone loss through SNS - derived signals originating in the ventromedial hypothalamic nuclei ( Takeda et al . , 2002 ) . The atrophic appearance of osteoblasts in both G - CSF - treated wild - type mice and steady - state Cgt (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice and the fact that osteoblasts do not express G - CSFR or Cgt genes strongly supported the possibility that the rapid G - CSF - mediated osteoblast suppression is controlled by the nervous system . Several lines of evidence indeed indicate that sympathetic signals contribute to the dramatic reduction in osteoblast function that follows G - CSF administration . First , the admin - istration of 6OHDA in neonatal or adult mice inhibited mobi - lization without toxicity to the HSPC content in the BM . Sec - ond , G - CSF - induced HSPC mobilization was severely altered in NE - deﬁcient mice . Third , osteoblast function was suppressed by G - CSF in control mice but not in mice with impaired SNS activity . Fourth , mobilization efﬁciency corre - lated with bone CXCL12 levels that were suppressed in Dbh + / (cid:1) and preserved in Dbh (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice . Fifth , the administra - tion of a b 2 adrenergic agonist rescued the mobilization de - fect in Dbh (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice and enhanced mobilization in control mice . Finally , administration of a b adrenergic antagonist sig - niﬁcantly reduced mobilization . The lower inhibition observed with b blockers compared with neonate 6OHDA - treated or Dbh (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice may result from incomplete inhibition of norad - renergic signaling . Consistent with this possibility , pharma - cologic inhibition of b adrenergic receptors did not affect Figure 7 .

ReleasedNE ( 1 ) andayetunidentiﬁedsignal ( 2 ) mediateosteoblast ( OB ) suppression , thereby reducing the synthesis of CXCL12 . Posttranslational mechanisms ( degradation / inactivation ) may also contribute to lowering CXCL12 levels to those per - missiveforHSPCegressfromtheirniche . WeproposethatOBsuppressionandCXCL12reductionleadtoHSPCmobilization . Inaddition , itispossiblethat adrenergic neurotransmission also regulates HSPC mobilization through other mechanisms , given the newly identiﬁed non - OB stem cell niches ( Kiel et al . , 2005 ) . Cell 124 , 407 – 421 , January 27 , 2006 ª 2006 Elsevier Inc . 417 bone resorption to the extent observed for genetic ablation of the b 2 adrenergic receptor ( Elefteriou et al . , 2005 ) . While we found a strong correlation between osteoblast suppression and HSPC mobilization , our studies do not prove a causal relationship . It is interesting that another stem cell niche was recently identiﬁed near endothelial cells ( Kiel et al . , 2005 ) . While it is temping to speculate that sym - pathetic innervation , which accompanies the BM vascula - ture , may regulate the endothelial stem cell niche , whether osteoblasts can inﬂuence the attraction of these stem cells in the BM is unknown . The involvement of the SNS in HSPC mobilization sug - gested that the target of G - CSF may be extramedullary and may in fact be neuronal or glial . On the other hand , G - CSFR expression on a transplantable hematopoietic cell was shown to be required for G - CSF - induced mobilization ( Liu et al . , 2000 ) . Based on studies describing leptin - medi - ated neuronal control of osteoblast function ( Takeda et al . , 2002 ; Elefteriou et al . , 2005 ) and the fact that leptin and G - CSF receptors display a high degree of homology ( Tarta - glia et al . , 1995 ) , we have considered the possibility that G - CSF signals directly in the hypothalamus through the lep - tin receptor . However , expression of the leptin receptor does not appear to be required for HSPC mobilization since it pro - ceeds normally in leptin receptor - deﬁcient db / db mice ( Fig - ure S3 ) . In addition , the impaired mobilization after ICV infu - sion of G - CSF or in mice that have a peripheral SNS defect ( 6OHDA - lesioned adult mice ) indicates that the cellular tar - get for G - CSF is in the periphery . Our results suggest that G - CSF may increase sympathetic tone in bone and that both G - CSF and adrenergic signaling cooperate to trigger HSPC egress ( Figure 7D ) . Supporting evidence for a cooperation between these signals comes from the fact that clenbuterol does not by itself induce mobi - lization but that it can rescue at least in part the defect in Dbh (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice and enhance the mobilizing effects of G - CSF in Dbh + / (cid:1) mice . Whether G - CSF can modulate the release / reuptake of NE by acting directly on neurons of sympathetic ganglia or via neighboring glial cells is currently unknown . Trophic Neuronal Signals to Osteoblast The constitutive suppression of osteoblast function in Cgt (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice might be due to increased sympathetic tone ( Takeda et al . , 2002 ) or , alternatively , a reduction in putative neurally transmitted trophic signals . Osteoblasts have been reported to express receptors for several neuropeptides , suggesting that they could indeed integrate multiple neuronal signals ( Togari , 2002 ) . We have measured NE turnover in cardiac tis - sues of Cgt littermates and found a longer halﬂife in Cgt (cid:1) / (cid:1) hearts , indicating reduced peripheral sympathetic activity in the null mice ( Figure S4 ) . Although this ﬁnding would be consistent with their mobilization defect , b 2 adrenergic stim - ulation did not rescue the mobilization defect of Cgt (cid:1) / (cid:1) ani - mals ( data not shown ) . It is possible that the phenotype of Cgt (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice may result from their basal osteoblast suppres - sion . The difference in osteoblast morphology at baseline between Cgt (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice and mice harboring compromised SNS signaling clearly suggests deﬁcits in Cgt (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice that lie outside noradrenergic innervation ( compare Figure 4A with Figures 5E and 6E ) and imply the presence of physiolog - ical neurally transmitted trophic signals to osteoblasts . A Common Niche for Stem Cells and Common Lymphoid Progenitor Cells ? We have previously reported a lymphopoietic defect in Cgt (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice that was associated with a deﬁcit in the stromal microenvironment supporting lymphoid commitment ( Ka - tayama and Frenette , 2003 ) . The steady - state reductions in CLP content in the BM of Cgt (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice and the reduced os - teoblast activity reported herein suggest that osteoblasts may support the commitment of stem cells toward the lym - phoid lineage . Consistent with this possibility , postnatal ab - lation of osteoblasts was recently shown to reduce bone marrow B cell content by (cid:2) 97 % , while HSPC numbers were much less affected ( Visnjic et al . , 2004 ) , indicating that the earliest committed lymphoid progenitor cell may re - quire osteoblasts for survival , proliferation , or differentiation . A close relationship between CLP and the stem cell niche is further suggested by the expression of the Notch - 1 ligand , Jagged - 1 , in the osteoblastic niche and the fact that Notch - 1 can promote both stem cell self - renewal and differ - entiation toward the lymphoid lineage ( Calvi et al . , 2003 ; Pui et al . , 1999 ; Radtke et al . , 1999 ) . More differentiated B cell precursors ( B220 + ﬂk2 + ) , distant from the endosteum , are closely associated with CXCL12 - expressing stromal cells , which do not express the Notch - 1 ligands Jagged - 1 or Delta - like - 1 ( Tokoyoda et al . , 2004 ) . Further studies are thus needed to determine whether the nervous system inﬂu - ences homeostatic migration of stem cells among cellular niches in the BM . In summary , we show here that the sympathetic nervous system regulates the egress of stem and progenitor cells from their niche . These results raise the interesting possibility that alterations in the sympathetic tone may explain the con - spicuous variability in mobilization efﬁciencies among normal donors ( Korbling et al . , 1995 ) . Modulation of the sympathetic outﬂow to the stem cell niche represents a novel strategy to increase the efﬁciency of HSPC harvests for stem cell - based therapeutics . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Animals Cgt + / + , + / (cid:1) , and (cid:1) / (cid:1) littermate mice , backcrossed seven generations into the C57BL / 6 background , were used for experiments performed be - tween 3 and 4 weeks of age .

For b adrenergic receptor blockade , 4 - week - old C57BL / 6 mice were treated with propranolol ( 0 . 5 g / l in drink - ing water , Sigma ) or control pure water for 3 weeks prior to mobilization . For rescue experiments , clenbuterol ( 2 mg / kg / day , i . p . ) was injected starting day (cid:1) 2 prior to and continued during G - CSF treatment .
