Cell - motility speed was measured by live - cell imaging of single cells migrating on tissue - culture plas - tic dishes . Overall cell speed was significantly affected by cortactin knockdown and overexpression ( 33 % de - crease and 36 % increase compared with control pRS cells , respectively ) ( Figure 1E , see Supplemental Mov - ies in the Supplemental Data available with this article online ) . There was no difference in directional persis - tence of cell migration ( Figure S1 ) .

A kymograph represents a timeline of protrusion and allows quantitation of at least four parameters : lamellipodial persistence , protru - sion velocity , retraction velocity , and protrusion dis - tance ( Figure 2A ) [ 13 , 14 ] . pRS - KD cells exhibited a 2 - fold decrease in lamellipodial persistence ( the amount of time that a lamellipodia spends protruding before re - traction ) when compared with vector - only and scram - Figure 1 .

These data indicate that local - ization of cortactin to HT1080 lamellipodia depends on interactions with Arp2 / 3 complex . Cortactin binding to F - actin is also important for function because , despite localization to the leading edge ( Figure 4 ) , expression of the (cid:1) 4RP actin binding mutant was unable to rescue any pRS - KD phenotypes , including invasion ( Figure 3 ) . Cortactin Binds Preferentially to Dynamic - Actin Filaments Newly polymerized actin filaments are formed from ATP - actin monomers . ATP - F - actin is hydrolyzed to ADP - Pi - F - actin at a rate of 0 . 3 sec −1 [ 20 ] followed by release of the inorganic phosphate ( Pi ) at a rate of 0 . 002 sec −1 to form ADP - F - actin [ 21 ] . As a result of this large rate differential , dynamic - actin filaments are composed mainly of both ATP - ( from ongoing polymerization ) and ADP - Pi - actin ( from slow release of the hydrolyzed phosphate ) , and older actin filaments are composed mainly of ADP - F - actin [ 1 ] . The nucleotide state of actin affects the kinetics of actin assembly [ 1 , 22 ] , as well as interactions with certain actin - associated proteins such as cofilin [ 1 , 23 ] . We tested whether cortactin preferen - tially binds dynamic actin by performing binding experi - ments in which purified N - terminal cortactin fragment ( 100 nM ) was incubated with various concentrations of ATP - or ADP - actin filaments . This cortactin fragment is sufficient for proper localization in Rac1 - induced lamel - lipodia [ 5 ] , can rescue the protrusion and motility phe - notypes of pRS - KD cells ( Figure 3 ) , and contains the only actin binding site [ 5 ] . After the ultracentrifugal sed - imentation of actin filaments , bound N - terminal cortac - tin was calculated from the amount depleted from the supernatants ( Figure 5B ) . The results indicate that N - terminal cortactin has a 15 - fold higher affinity for fila - ments prepared from ATP - actin than for those prepared from ADP - actin ( K d = 0 . 248 (cid:2) M versus 3 . 87 (cid:2) M , Figure 5A ) . The K d for ATP - actin is similar to previous deter - minations ( 0 . 230 – 0 . 430 (cid:2) M ) [ 7 , 24 ] . Because the F - actin prepared from ATP - actin monomer likely contains a mixture of both ATP - and ADP - Pi - F - actin , further exper - iments were performed with actin polymerized in the presence of beryllium fluoride to mimic ADP - Pi - F - actin and full - length cortactin ( 70 nM ) . Cortactin binds to ADP - BeF3 - F - actin with a slightly higher affinity than that of ATP - actin ( K d = 0 . 107 (cid:2) M versus K d = 0 . 273 (cid:2) M , Figure 5C ) . These data are consistent with preferential binding of cortactin to dynamic - actin filaments , with the highest apparent affinity for ADP - Pi filaments .

Under these conditions , gether , these data indicate that cortactin regulates Arp2 / 3 - complex - mediated actin assembly in lamelli - cells have robust protrusion ( Figures 6E and 6F ) . Cells were imaged with identical microscope and camera podia . An intriguing clue as to how cortactin - enhanced actin assembly may lead to lamellipodial persistence settings . Quantitation of the average fluorescence inten - sity at the leading edge indicates that pRS - KD cells have and motility is provided by the observation that in knockdown cells , there is a reduction in the rate of new a 34 % decrease in Alexa - actin incorporation at the lead - ing edge compared with control and pRS - KD / LZRS - FL - adhesion formation in lamellipodia , as measured by paxillin turnover . rescued cells ( Figure 6G ) . Thus , cortactin affects the availability of uncapped barbed ends in lamellipodia . There is no difference in Arp2 / 3 - complex localization to Cortactin Bridges Arp2 / 3 Complex and Dynamic lamellipodia , suggesting a change in Arp2 / 3 - complex Actin in Lamellipodia function ( Figure S3 ) . Although not mutually exclusive , Two results strongly suggest that cortactin may act as these data are more consistent with a role for cortactin a bridge that tightens Arp2 / 3 - complex association with in enhancement of Arp2 / 3 - complex activity than in sta - freshly polymerized actin filaments : First , phenotype bilization of preexisting branches . rescue in knockdown cells requires recombinant cor - tactin fragments that simultaneously bind Arp2 / 3 com - Cortactin Regulates the Assembly Rate of New plex and actin filaments ; second , cortactin has higher Adhesions in Cellular Protrusions affinity for ATP / ADP - Pi - than ADP - actin filaments . A A potential mechanism by which cortactin might en - bridge mechanism is consistent with previous cosedi - hance lamellipodial persistence and increase cell motil - mentation experiments showing that cortactin strength - ity is by promoting the formation of new cellular adhe - ens association of Arp2 / 3 complex with actin filaments sions in protrusions . This possibility was tested with [ 7 ] . It is not clear , though , whether this cortactin bridge GFP - paxillin to mark nascent adhesions [ 27 , 28 ] . Con - provides a direct activation boost to the Arp complex trol and pRS - KD cells expressing GFP - paxillin were or adds mechanical strength to actin - network branch plated on glass dishes coated with 1 (cid:2) g / ml fibronectin points or both .

It vealed that pRS - KD cells have a selective defect in the also easily explains the cortactin - dependent increase assembly rate of new adhesions ( Figure 7B , Table 1 ) . in free barbed ends we observed in lamellipodia . In this There is no significant change in the adhesion disas - scenario , the cortactin activation boost would likely oc - sembly rate ( Figure 7C , Table 1 ) . The assembly defect cur after initial activation of Arp2 / 3 complex by WAVE in pRS - KD cells is fully rescued by N - terminal cortactin proteins because WAVE - 2 knockdown cells are unable ( Table 1 ) , indicating that interactions with Arp2 / 3 com - to initiate lamellipodial protrusion—i . e . , their absence plex and F - actin are sufficient to promote adhesion as - preempts cortactin action . In this context , we cannot sembly . In some experiments , cells were cultured on rule out the possibility that cortactin may augment plastic overnight ( the same conditions as the lamelli - WAVE - 2 activity . podial - protrusion assays ) and imaged by dual IRM / Mechanical strengthening is supported by in vitro GFP - paxillin fluorescence . As with cells plated on fibro - data showing preformed branch point stabilization by nectin , pRS - KD cells cultured on plastic have a selec - cortactin [ 6 ] . In this respect , it is not known whether tive defect in adhesion assembly ( data not shown ) . The cortactin interacts with the mother or daughter filament sites of closest adhesion by IRM colocalized with GFP - at an actin branch point . However , because it is re - paxillin fluorescence ( Figure S4 ) . cruited early by Arp2 / 3 complex and may contribute to its activation , it seems more plausible that cortactin strengthens the association of Arp2 / 3 complex with an Discussion ADP - Pi - actin patch on the mother filament . Removal of Pi from aging mother filaments ( e . g . , by cofilin [ 20 ] ) We show that cortactin affects cell motility , most likely through enhancement of lamellipodial persistence . This could then weaken cortactin - filaments interaction and release the bridge as the network retracts . It is possible conclusion is based on analysis of RNAi knockdown cells by live - cell imaging and biochemical approaches . to envision other mechanistic scenarios ; more experi - ments are needed to clarify these interactions . Our main finding is that in reconstitution experiments , both the Arp2 / 3 and F - actin binding sites are necessary Another point that needs clarification is the spatio - temporal relationship between cortactin and the Arp2 / 3 and sufficient to rescue fully the persistence and motil - ity phenotype , suggesting that cortactin forms a molec - complex’s main activators , WASp family proteins . Be - cause WASps are strictly located on membranes [ 4 , ular bridge between Arp2 / 3 complex and actin fila - ments . Mutant - localization data indicate that Arp2 / 3 10 ] , it is possible that cortactin is recruited by Arp2 / 3 complex immediately after the newly formed actin complex primarily recruits cortactin to the leading edge of migrating cells . At this site , cortactin preferentially branch moves away from the membrane . Alternatively , cortactin might bind Arp2 / 3 complex simultaneously binds newly polymerized actin filaments , as shown by cosedimentation studies assessing its affinity for ATP / with WASp proteins at the membrane . Biochemical ex - periments with N - WASp indicate that under some con - ADP - Pi - versus ADP - actin . In situ barbed - end - labeling studies suggest that cortactin boosts Arp2 / 3 - complex ditions , cortactin and N - WASp can simultaneously bind Arp2 / 3 complex [ 19 ] . However , it is unknown whether activity , either directly or indirectly , in lamellipodia . To - Current Biology 1282 Figure 7 .
