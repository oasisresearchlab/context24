MOLECULAR MEDICINE REPORTS 9 : 103 - 108 , 2014 Abstract . Osteosarcoma is a type of malignant bone tumor with high metastasis and poor prognosis . Previous studies have demonstrated the involvement of LIM kinase 1 ( LIMK1 ) in the proliferation of osteosarcoma cells . LIMK1 is overexpressed in human osteosarcoma tissues and cell lines . To further study LIMK1 - associated mechanisms , we used shRNA targeted to the LIMK1 gene to block its expression in the osteosarcoma cell lines MG63 and U2OS . Insulin promoted the prolif - eration of MG63 cells in a time - and dose - dependent manner , however , this insulin induced proliferation was significantly inhibited by transfection of shRNA targeted to the LIMK1 gene , as well as by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 , but not by the mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) inhibitor PD98059 . The level of cofilin phosphorylation was increased significantly following stimulation of insulin for 24 h , indi - cating the activation of LIMK1 . MG63 cell proliferation was also significantly inhibited by 1 , 25 - dihydroxy vitamin D3 ( 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2 D 3 ) in a time - dependent manner . Furthermore , 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2 D 3 negated the inhibitory effect of LIMK1 shRNA , indicating that LIMK1 is important in the inhibitory pathway of 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2 D 3 . The present study confirms that LIMK1 is important in regulating osteosarcoma cell proliferation via the insulin / PI3K / LIMK1 signaling pathway , thus the develop - ment of gene therapy for osteosarcoma targeting LIMK1 is warranted . Introduction Osteosarcoma is one of the most common bone tumors , particularly in teenagers . It is highly malignant with a poor prognosis due to its high risk of relapse and metastasis ( 1 ) . Conventional treatment includes surgical resection combined with chemotherapy , which is determined based on the scope of tumor invasion . Approximately 30 % of patients at early stages have distant metastasis following surgery and chemo - therapy ( 2 ) . With advances in molecular biology and cell biology in clinical oncology , a limited understanding of the mechanisms underlying osteosarcoma at the molecular level has been developed . The abnormal expression of certain onco - genes ( e - myc , e - ras and e - fos ) and anti - oncogenes ( p53 , Rb and pl6 ) has been found to be associated with this disease . This pattern of gene expression may provide a theoretical founda - tion of target gene selection for osteosarcoma gene therapy ( 3 ) . Actin is the major cytoskeletal protein responsible for main - taining cell shape and polarity , promoting cell migration and cytokinesis by dynamic alterations in depolymerization and repolymerization . Actin participates in various physiological and pathological processes , including phagocytosis , endo - cytosis , embryogenesis , organogenesis and angiogenesis ( 4 ) . Recent studies have demonstrated that actin reorganization is also involved in tumor cell migration , invasion and metas - tasis ( 5 - 7 ) . Cofilin is a member of the actin depolymerization factor ( ADF ) / cofilin family , which is able to reinforce actin motion and assist cell movement and chemotaxis ( 8 , 9 ) . The LIM kinase 1 ( LIMK1 ) pathway and the slingshot phosphatase pathway are two effective and important pathways involved in regulating cofilin activation . LIMK1 specifically phosphory - lates cofilin and thus regulates actin filament dynamics under the control of Rac , while LIMK2 is important in regulating stress fiber and filopodia formation and accompanying actin cytoskeletal dynamics , specifically downstream of Rho and Cdc42 . LIMK1 is a novel dual specificity ( serine / threonine and tyrosine ) kinase that contains two amino - terminal LIM domains ( 10 ) . The LIMK1 gene is expressed predominantly in the brain and in developing neural tissues ( 11 ) and its deletion ( microdeletion of chromosome 7q11 . 23 ) is typically associated with Williams syndrome ( 12 ) . LIMK1 is acti - vated by phosphorylation at Thr - 508 ( in the kinase catalytic domain ) by ROCK and PAK . These activating kinases are downstream kinases of the Rho family of small GTPases , Rho , Rac and Cdc42 ( 13 - 15 ) . LIMK1 is also able to be LIM kinase 1 is required for insulin‑dependent cell growth of osteosarcoma cell lines HAI - SHAN ZHANG 1 , JIAN - WU ZHAO 2 , HONG WANG 3 , HAN - YANG ZHANG 2 , QIU - YE JI 3 , LING - JIE MENG 3 , FENG - JUAN XING 3 , SHU - TING YANG 4 and YAN WANG 3 Departments of 1 Colorectal and Anal Surgery and 2 Orthopaedics ; 3 Research Center for Gene Therapy , China - Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University , Changchun , Jilin 130033 ; 4 Department of Prosthodontics , School of Stomatology , Jilin University , Changchun , Jilin 130021 , P .

In the present study , we silenced the LIMK1 gene using interferon RNA in the cultured human osteosarcoma cell lines U2OS and MG63 , and studied the effect and mechanisms of human osteosarcoma cell proliferation following LIMK1 knockdown . Materials and methods Tissue samples and cell culture . The human osteosarcoma cell lines U2OS and MG63 ( purchased from the Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology , Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences , Chinese Academy of Sciences , Shanghai , China ) were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco ' s modified Eagle ' s medium ( H - DMEM ; Gibco - BRL Carlsbad , CA , USA ) containing 10 % fetal calf serum . Human fetal osteoblastic ( hFOB ) 1 . 19 cells ( donated by the Pathology Laboratory of Jilin University , Changchun , Jilin , China ) were cultured in DMEM - F12 ( Gibco - BRL ) supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum . All three types of cells were incubated at 37˚C , satu - rated humidity and 5 % CO 2 . Tumor samples from a total of 6 patients were collected intraoperatively and stored at - 80˚C with written consent obtained . The present study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Jilin University and informed consent was obtained from the patients / patient ' s families . Immunohistochemical and hematoxylin and eosin ( HE ) staining . Tumor tissue sections were incubated with 3 % H 2 O 2 to inactivate endogenous peroxidase followed by deparaf - fination and rehydration . The antigen was restored with 3 % proteinase K , followed by washing with phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) and blocking with 10 % goat serum for 1 h at room temperature . The sections were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a mouse mAb targeting β - actin ( 1 : 500 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Inc . , Santa Cruz , CA , USA ) or rabbit pAb to LIMK1 , p - LIMK1 , cofilin or p - cofilin ( 1 : 100 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Inc . ) to detect tumor cells . Biotinylated rabbit anti - mouse immunoglobulin diluted 1 : 100 in 3 % normal goat serum was applied for 1 h and followed with peroxidase - conjugated horseradish streptavidin - biotin complex for 10 min . Reaction sites were visualized using diaminobenzidine as the chromogen and nuclei were counter - stained with hematoxylin . Paraffin - embedded sections were dehydrated , mounted with neutral gum and observed under a light microscope ( Olympus , Tokyo , Japan ) . Immunoprecipitation and western blot analysis . Human osteo - sarcoma cells , U2OS and MG63 , and human osteoblast cells , HFOB1 . 19 , were lysed with lysis buffer ( 150 mM of NaCl , 1 % Nonidet P - 40 , 50 mM of Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 and 20 µM of PMSF ) at 4˚C for 30 min and centrifuged at 12 , 000 x g at 4˚C for 15 min . The supernatant was stored at - 70˚C . Equal amounts of protein ( 100 ng ) , 15 µl of protein A agarose beads and 1 µl of anti - LIMK1 antibody ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Inc . ) were added to the tubes and rotated overnight at 4˚C . The agarose - antibody - antigen complexes were collected by centrifugation ( 20 sec at 12 , 000 x g ) . The supernatant was carefully removed and the complexes were washed twice with lysis buffer . The pellet was resuspended in gel - loading buffer and the protein was denatured by boiling for 5 min . Protein A agarose beads were removed by centrifugation at 12 , 000 x g for 20 sec and the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube . The proteins were separated by SDS - PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting analysis , as described previously ( 17 ) , using primary antibodies against LIMK1 , P ( T508 ) - LIMK1 , cofilin and p - cofilin ( 1 : 500 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Inc . ) . Immunodetection was accomplished using a HRP - conjugated goat anti - rabbit secondary antibody ( 1 : 1 , 000 ; Bioworld Technology Co , Ltd . , St . Louis Park , MN , USA ) and protein bands were developed with an ECL Chemiluminescent Substrate Reagent kit ( Invitrogen Life Technologies , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) and analyzed by Image J Software ( National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD , USA ) . Knockdown of LIMK1 . To assess the effect of LIMK1 knock - down on insulin - induced cell proliferation , we generated an shRNA construct using the pSUPER vector ( Oligo Engine , Seattle , WA , USA ) , as described previously ( 18 , 19 ) . The 19 - base targeting sequences used in the present study were as follows : 5 ' - GCTGGAACAATGGCTAGAA - 3 ' ( human LIMK1 ) . As a control , we used a nontargeting sequence , 5 ' - TCTTCCCCCAAGAAAGATA - 3 ' , which does not exist in the human genome . MG63 cells were plated in 100 mm dishes ( 1 . 5x10 6 cells / dish ) and cultured for 24 h followed by transfection with pSUPER - LIMK1 or the control pSUPER vector . Transfected cells were cultured for 24 h prior to being transferred into 96 - well chamber slides at 5x10 3 cells / well . The cells were continuously cultured for 16 h followed by serum starvation for 4 h and then cultured with or without 1 µg / ml of insulin for 24 h . Cell proliferation assay . MG63 or transfected MG63 ( pSUPER - LIMK1 - MG63 ) cells were seeded into 96 - well plates . After achieving 70 % confluence , the cells were suspended in 100 µl of serum - free medium . After 24 h , insulin ( 1 µg / ml ; Sigma , St . Louis , MO , USA ) or 1 , 25 - dihydroxy vitamin D3 ( 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2 D 3 ; 10 - 7 mol / l ; Sigma ) was added into each well . The Cell Counting kit - 8 ( CCK - 8 , Dojindo Laboratories , Kumamoto , Japan ) was used to assess cell proliferation at 24 , 48 and 72 h . To study the effect of inhibitors , cells were incubated with 20 mM of PD98059 , a selective MEK1 inhibitor ( Sigma ) , or 10 µM of LY294002 , a potent inhibitor for PI3K ( Sigma ) . Cells were exposed to these inhibitors in serum - free medium at 37˚C for 1 h , followed by the addition of 1 µg / ml of insulin . The control group was treated with H - DMEM as a standard solution . Cells in the culture plates were incubated at 37˚C with 5 % CO 2 and 95 % humidity . After 24 h , the optical density of the wells was read at 450 nm . The CCK - 8 ( Dojindo Laboratories ) reagent ( 10 µl ) was added into each well and incubated at 37˚C for 2 h and the optical density was read again at 450 nm . The cell proliferation was calculated according to the manufacturer ' s instructions . Statistical analysis . All data are presented as the mean ± stan - dard deviation ( mean ± SD ) . Statistical analysis was performed MOLECULAR MEDICINE REPORTS 9 : 103 - 108 , 2014 105 using one - way ANOVA ( including Newman - Keuls multiple comparison test ) and statistical analysis software Prism 4 ( GraphPad Software , Inc . , La Jolla , CA , USA ) . P < 0 . 05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference . Results Expression of LIMK1 , p - LIMK1 , cofilin and p - cofilin in human osteosarcoma cells . Human osteosarcomatous tissues were analyzed by HE staining and intensity immu - nohistochemistry was performed using a specific antibody to recognize the expression of LIMK1 / p - LIMK1 and cofilin / P - cofilin in human osteosarcoma tissues . We demon - strated that tumor cells were distributed in a diffuse pattern or formed cancer nests . The size and the degree of differ - entiation of the cells varied . The cells demonstrated large heteromorphic anachromasis and karyokinesis and a high nucleo - cytoplasmic ratio ( Fig . 1A and B ) . The expression of cofilin / p - cofilin ( Fig . 1C and D ) and LIMK1 / p - LIMK1 ( Fig . 1E and F ) in tumor parenchyma was clearly higher than that in the mesenchyme , indicating that LIMK1 and cofilin were overexpressed in osteosarcomatous parenchyma . This result was confirmed by western blot analysis , which demonstrated that the expression levels of LIMK1 in U2OS and MG63 cells were almost 2 - fold of that in hFOB1 . 19 cells ( Fig . 2 ) . These data indicated that the overexpression of LIMK1 may be associated with osteosarcoma biological activity . Effect of LIMK1 in insulin and 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2 D 3 mediated prolif - eration of human osteosarcoma cells . Insulin exerts , via the insulin receptor α , a wide range of biological responses affecting glucose , lipid and protein metabolism as well as cell proliferation and survival ( 20 , 21 ) . The effect of insulin on the proliferation of MG63 cells was assessed . The results demonstrated that insulin dose - dependently promoted the proliferation of MG63 , with an effective concentra - tion between 0 . 5 to 10 µg / ml ( Fig . 3A ) . MG63 cells were then treated with 1 µg / ml of insulin for 0 , 24 , 48 and 72 h ( Fig . 3B ) . The results demonstrated that the insulin - induced cell proliferation increased with time and the effect of insulin was predominantly robust at 24 h . We also studied the possible mechanisms respon - sible for insulin - induced osteosarcoma cell proliferation . Osteosarcoma cells were pretreated with the PI3K pathway inhibitor LY294002 ( 10 µM ) or the MAPK pathway inhibitor PD98059 ( 20 µM ) for 1 h prior to 24 h incubation with insulin . The results demonstrated that PD98059 had no impact on insulin - induced cell proliferation , whereas LY294002 significantly inhibited insulin - induced cell proliferation ( Fig . 3C ) , indicating that insulin - induced cell proliferation may be associated with the PI3K pathway , but not the MAPK pathway . LIMK1 activation leads to the phosphorylation and deactivation of cofilin , which is a specific substrate of LIMK1 ( 22 ) . Thus , we examined the expression and acti - vation of cofilin in human osteosarcoma cells by western blotting . After MG63 cells were stimulated by insulin at various concentrations for 24 h , the expression of p - cofilin and p - LIMK1 was significantly increased compared with the control group . Pretreatment of cells with LY294002 significantly inhibited the insulin - induced increase of p - cofilin and p - LIMK1 expression ( Fig . 4 ) . By contrast , Figure 2 .

Our data suggested that insulin - induced human osteosar - coma cell proliferation was associated with the LIMK1 / cofilin signaling pathway , which is regulated by PI3K . To determine the role of LIMK1 in this pathway , we constructed an shRNA vector targeting LIMK1 ( pSUPER - LIMK1 ) . Western blotting demonstrated that MG63 cells transfected with the LIMK1 shRNA expressed little endogenous LIMK1 compared with cells transfected with control shRNA ( Fig . 5A ) , indicating that the shRNA vector targeting LIMK1 ( pSUPER - LIMK1 ) was constructed successfully . Furthermore , the LIMK1 Figure 3 . Effect of insulin on the proliferation of human osteosarcoma cells . ( A ) Serum - starved MG63 cells were stimulated with different concentrations of insulin .

After the LIMK1 gene was silenced by transfection of pSUPER - LIMK1 , there was a significant decrease in cell proliferation and insulin - induced proliferation was completely inhibited ( Fig . 5C ) , indicating that LIMK1 was essential in regulating the basic and insulin - induced proliferation of MG63 human osteosarcoma cells . Additionally , we demonstrated that 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2 D 3 , at a concentration of 10 - 7 mol / l , inhibited human osteosarcoma cell proliferation in a time - dependent manner ( Fig . 6A ) . Transfection of pSUPER - LIMK1 plasmids led to significant inhibition of osteosarcoma cell proliferation . However , after 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2 D 3 was added , no further inhibition was observed indicating that LIMK1 is important in the inhibition of proliferation by 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2 D 3 ( Fig . 6B ) . Western blot analysis demonstrated that p - cofilin expression increased transiently at 24 h , followed by a decrease from 48 to 72 h following 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2 D 3 treatment ( Fig . 6C ) . The activity of cofilin is reversibly regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphoryla - tion at Ser - 3 , with the phosphorylated form being inactive . LIMK phosphorylates cofilin at Ser - 3 and thereby inhibits the actin filament disrupting the activity of cofilin . The inactive Ser - 3 - phosphorylated cofilin ( p - cofilin ) is dephosphorylated and reactivated by slingshot ( SSH ) family protein phospha - tases . Previous studies have demonstrated that slingshot and LIMK spatially and temporally regulate the expression of cofilin ( 23 , 24 ) . Thus , we hypothesized that the inhibitory effect of 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2 D 3 on cell proliferation may be associated with LIMK , slingshot or other related proteins . However , further studies are needed to examine this link . Discussion LIMK1 , one of the LIMK proteins , is a serine / threonine protein kinase that deactivates cofilin by phosphorylation , thus participating in the rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton . Activation of LIMK1 is regulated by multiple mechanisms and is important in extracellular stimulation and cytoskeleton stability ( 25 ) . Recent studies have demonstrated that LIMK1 is overexpressed and highly active in cells and tissues of certain malignant tumors , including prostatic cancer and breast cancer ( 26 ) , thus LIMK1 may be one of the key molecules that stimulates tumor cell invasion and metastasis , or possibly a new ' oncogene ' ( 9 ) . In the present study , LIMK1 and p - LIMK1 expression in tumor parenchyma cells are significantly higher than that in mesenchymal cells . Furthermore , compared with human osteoblast cells HFOB 1 . 19 , expression of LIMK1 protein in human osteosarcoma cells U2OS and MG63 was markedly higher , suggesting that overexpression of the LIMK1 protein in human osteosarcoma cells may have a connection with the biological characteristics of osteosarcoma . Insulin is a hormone with various biological effects , including the regulation of cell proliferation . Two major path - ways have been described in insulin signal transduction , one is the PI3K pathway , the other is the MAPK pathway . In the present study , insulin robustly enhanced MG63 cell prolifera - tion in a time and concentration - dependent manner . After cells were pretreated with the PI3K pathway inhibitor LY294002 , insulin - induced MG63 cell proliferation was inhibited . By contrast , the MAPK pathway inhibitor PD98059 had little effect , indicating that insulin - induced MG63 cell proliferation primarily relies on the PI3K pathway . In the present study , we detected changes in cofilin protein expression and activity in human osteosarcoma cells stimu - lated by insulin at various concentrations for 24 h . Compared with the control group , p - cofilin expression was significantly increased , which indicated that insulin activates cofilin - related signaling pathways . LIMK1 is important in cofilin activation , thus cofilin phosphorylation , to a certain extent , is associated Figure 6 . Effect of LIMK1 in 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2 D 3 mediated proliferation of human osteosarcoma cells . ( A ) Serum - starved MG63 cells were stimulated with 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2 D 3 ( 10 - 7 mol / l ) for the indicated times .

A B C ZHANG et al : LIMK1 AND INSULIN IN OSTEOSARCOMA CELL GROWTH 108 with LIMK1 activation . However , insulin - induced activation of cofilin was inhibited by LY294002 , suggesting PI3K is involved in this process . We then transfected the pSUPER - LIMK1 plasmid into MG63 cells to block transcription of the LIMK1 gene . Cell proliferation was inhibited by blocking LIMK1 gene expres - sion , furthermore , insulin - induced cell proliferation was eradicated as well . These data suggest that the expression of LIMK1 and the activation of the insulin / LIMK1 pathway are crucial in regulating MG63 cell proliferation . The hormone variant of vitamin D3 , 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2 D 3 , regu - lates the expression of genes through the interaction between the specificity receptor vitamin D receptor ( VDR ) , similarly to other steroid hormones . It is also important in inhibiting tumor cell proliferation and promoting tumor cell differentiation ( 27 ) . Prior studies have demonstrated that 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2 D 3 inhibits the proliferation of numerous tumors and synergistically promotes apoptotic death of tumor cells in combination with other anticancer drugs ( 28 , 29 ) . However , the signaling transduction mechanisms by which 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2 D 3 inhibits tumor cell prolif - eration are not clear . Using western blotting we demonstrated that p - cofilin expression significantly increased following stimulation with 10 - 7 mol / l of 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2 D 3 for 24 h . The proliferation of human osteosarcoma MG63 cells was signifi - cantly inhibited after cells were stimulated with 10 - 7 mol / l of 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2 D 3 . Cell proliferation was also significantly inhibited after the plasmid pSUPER - LIMK1 was transfected into human osteosarcoma cells , however , there was no apparent further inhibition following the addition of 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2 D 3 , indicating that LIMK1 and 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2 D 3 may share the same pathway in inhibiting the proliferation of human osteosarcoma cells . In summary , LIMK1 and activation of the insulin / PI3K / LIMK1 signaling pathway have major effects on human osteosarcoma cell proliferation . The present study provides new insight into LIMK1 - regulated osteosarcoma genesis and development .
