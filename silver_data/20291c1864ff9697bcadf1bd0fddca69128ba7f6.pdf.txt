Significance Statement We demonstrate a novel functional dissociation between the angular gyrus ( AG ) and posterior middle temporal gyrus ( pMTG ) in conceptual processing . These sites are often coactivated during neuroimaging studies using semantic tasks , but their individual contributions are unclear . Using transcranial magnetic stimulation and tasks designed to assess different aspects of semantics ( itemidentityandthematicmatching ) , wetestedtwoalternativetheoreticalaccounts . Neithersiteshowedthepatternexpectedfor a “thematic hub” ( i . e . , a site storing associations between concepts ) since stimulation disrupted both tasks . Instead , the data indicatedthatpMTGcontributestothecontrolledretrievalofconceptualknowledge , whileAGiscriticalfortheefficientautomatic retrieval of specific semantic information . 15230 • TheJournalofNeuroscience , November18 , 2015 • 35 ( 46 ) : 15230 – 15239 objects , we activate representations in anterior temporal lobes ( ATLs ) that capture conceptual similarities extracted from percep - tual / motorfeatures ( Rogersetal . , 2004 ; Pattersonetal . , 2007 ) . How - ever , we know a myriad of features and associations for any given concept ; and since only some of these are relevant at any one time , executive semantic processes are recruited to flexibly shape retrieval toward relevant but nondominant aspects ( Thompson - Schill et al . , 1997 ; Wagner et al . , 2001 ; Jefferies and Lambon Ralph , 2006 ) . Thus , the ATL hub interacts with control processes supported by left infe - riorfrontalgyrus ( LIFG ; Thompson - Schilletal . , 1997 ; Wagneretal . , 2001 ; Badre et al . , 2005 ; Noonan et al . , 2013 ) and other sites within the frontoparietal “multiple - demand” executive system ( Duncan , 2010 ) . Greater control over conceptual retrieval is required when there is strong competition from alternative meanings and / or when the context only weakly cues the retrieval of relevant information ( Badre et al . , 2005 ; Bedny et al . , 2008 ; Noonan et al . , 2010 , 2013 ; Whitney et al . , 2011b ; Rodd et al . , 2012 ) . While ATL and LIFG are associated with automatic and con - trolled semantic retrieval , respectively , the contribution of tem - poroparietal regions remains unclear , even though posterior middle temporal gyrus ( pMTG ; Visser et al . , 2012 ; Noonan et al . , 2013 ) and mid - angular gyrus ( AG ; Binder et al . , 2009 ; Hum - phreys and Lambon Ralph , 2014 ) show highly reliable responses to semantic contrasts . Some theories propose a temporoparietal semantic store complementing the information in ATL ( Schwartz et al . , 2011 ) : ATL might integrate knowledge about concrete multimodal features , supporting the categorical organi - zation of knowledge ( Tyler et al . , 2003 ; Rogers et al . , 2004 ; e . g . , apple is similar to banana ) , while AG and / or pMTG capture the - matic knowledge ( such that apple is linked to pie ; Schwartz et al . , 2011 ; Mirman and Graziano , 2012a ; de Zubicaray et al . , 2013 ) . Alternatively , pMTG and / or AG might contribute to specific conceptual retrieval processes as opposed to aspects of representa - tion ( Cabeza et al . , 2011 ; Humphreys and Lambon Ralph , 2014 ) . Patients with semantic aphasia ( SA ) following left temporoparietal stroke have deficits of controlled semantic retrieval : this “deregu - lated” semantic cognition is also seen following LIFG damage and is qualitatively distinct from degraded semantic knowledge seen in se - mantic dementia ( Jefferies and Lambon Ralph , 2006 ; Noonan et al . , 2010 ) . However , this retrieval hypothesis remains highly controver - sial given that both regions are often considered to underpin aspects ofsemanticrepresentation ( Martin , 2007 ; Binderetal . , 2009 ) . More - over , the lesions in these patients prevent the separation of pMTG and AG , which might have dissociable functions . While these two regions can show activation to semantic contrasts that is similar to thatinfunctionalneuroimagingstudies ( Binderetal . , 2009 ) , arecent meta - analysis ( Noonan et al . , 2013 ) showed stronger responses in pMTG as well as LIFG to demanding semantic judgments requiring control over conceptual retrieval compared with easier judgments across studies . In contrast , mid - AG typically shows deactivation rel - ative to rest , which is greater for more difficult semantic and nonse - mantictasks ( Seghieretal . , 2010 ; Wirthetal . , 2011 ; Humphreysand Lambon Ralph , 2014 ; Humphreys et al . , 2015 ) . These observations are consistent with the view that AG may support automatic aspects of retrieval , while pMTG contributes to controlled semantic re - trieval . Toelucidatethedifferentfunctionalrolesoftheseregionsoftem - poroparietal cortex , we used transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) in healthy volunteers to produce focal “virtual lesions” in pMTG and AG , and explored the impact on identity and thematic association matching tasks . We tested the following two alternative hypotheses : ( 1 ) that AG and / or pMTG can be characterized as a “thematic hub” ; and ( 2 ) that these sites make dissociable contribu - tions to automatic and controlled aspects of semantic retrieval , respectively . Materials and Methods Overview . We used inhibitory off - line TMS ( pulses at 1 Hz for 10 min ) to producevirtuallesionswithinleftmid - AGandpMTG , andexaminedthe effect of this stimulation on two types of word – picture matching , requir - ing either ( 1 ) object identification ( e . g . , is the picture a Dalmation or a corgi ? ) or ( 2 ) the retrieval of thematic associations ( e . g . , does the picture of the Dalmation go with bone or feather ? ) . Since stimulation was deliv - ered off - line , TMS - induced disruption could not be attributed to dis - tracting jaw contractions or eye blinks following peripheral nerve stimulation . ( 3 ) We also included a control task ( scrambled picture matching ) and a control site ( vertex ) to test for nonspecific effects of TMS . Performance immediately after the application of TMS was com - pared with baseline data collected either immediately before or 30 min after stimulation , by which time inhibitory TMS effects are no longer expected to be present ( Pobric et al . , 2010 ; Whitney et al . , 2011b ) . This design allowed the order of TMS and baseline sessions to be counterbal - anced across participants . We conducted three complementary analyses of these data . Analysis 1 provides an omnibus model comparing TMS and no - TMS trials at each site across all of the tasks . Analyses 2 and 3 examined the thematic association and identity - matching tasks , respec - tively , examiningthedatafrompMTGandAGinmoredetail . InAnalysis 2 , we assessed the effect of strength of association within the thematic matching task , treating this predictor as a continuous variable , and con - trolling for the effects of psycholinguistic variables and nonspecific ef - fects of TMS . In Analysis 3 , we examined the effects of specificity on identitymatchingwhilecontrollingfortheeffectsoftypicalityandfamil - iarity plus nonspecific effects of TMS . Selection of stimulation sites . Figure 1 shows the stimulation sites in mid - AGandpMTGonaninflatedcorticalsurface . Thesesitesweretaken from two complementary meta - analyses of neuroimaging data . The left mid - AG site was taken from a meta - analysis ( Humphreys and Lambon Ralph , 2014 ) examining semantic tasks versus difficulty - matched nonse - mantic tasks and is comparable to the peak for semantics reported by Binder et al . ( 2009 ) . The pMTG site , in contrast , was a peak response in a meta - analysisexaminingdiversemanipulationsofsemanticcontrol ( i . e . , effects of strong competition , weak probe – target relationships , and im - poverished contextual constraints vs lower - control versions of these tasks ; Noonan et al . , 2013 ) . Thus , while the response to semantic manip - ulationsinneuroimagingstudiesoftenencompassesbothpMTGandAGwithinonecluster ( Binder et al . , 2009 ) , we predicted that these sites would show a functional dissociation , with a greater contribution to automatic aspects of retrieval in mid - AG and more controlled semantic processes in pMTG . These temporoparietal sites are sufficiently distant to allow their separate stimulation and thus permit dissociable effects of TMS . However , we cannot rule out the possibility that some TMS was also delivered to adjacent cortical regions . In Figure 1 , these locations are superimposed on maps of resting - state connectivity , which were com - puted using the TMS sites as seeds . The maps were produced using resting - state fMRI data from the Enhanced Nathan Kline Institute Rock - land Sample ( i . e . , a large publicly available set of resting - state data ; Nooner et al . , 2012 ) , and reveal that our AG and pMTG sites fall within distinctnetworks . StimulationofanadditionalsiteinATL ( (cid:2) 53 , 0 , (cid:2) 22 ) did not elicit any inhibitory effects and is not discussed further . In addi - tion to sites implicated in semantic cognition , we applied stimulation to a control site , the vertex , in each participant . Each of these sites was stimulated for each participant in a different session ; participants had twosessionsofTMSperweekseparatedbyaminimumof24h . Theorder of the sessions was counterbalanced across participants . Tasks . All semantic judgments involved word - to - picture matching , with a probe picture presented alongside three words ( i . e . , a three - alternative , forced - choice design ) . Figure 2 contains an example trial for each task . The thematic association task involved linking together things that were found or used together but did not have strongly overla - ppingphysicalfeatures ( e . g . , theprobeandtargetwerenotfromthesame semantic category ) . Relatively little executive control over semantic re - trieval is thought to be required when the probe – target relationship is Daveyetal . • SemanticCognitioninTemporoparietalCortex J . Neurosci . , November18 , 2015 • 35 ( 46 ) : 15230 – 15239 • 15231 strong ( e . g . , a picture of an Alsatian presented with the word bone ) since activation spreads rapidly and automatically between strongly re - lated concepts . In contrast , in harder thematic trials when the probe – target relationship is weaker ( e . g . , a picture of an Alsatian presented with the words razor wire ) , participants may need to identify a linking context in which the probe and target can relate to each other , and then tailor semantic retrieval toward features relevant for this context ( e . g . , fierce ) and away from dominant but currently irrelevant associ - ations ( e . g . , dog as pet ) . A group of nine par - ticipants who did not take part in the repetitive TMS experiment rated the probe – target pairs forthestrengthofassociationona7pointscale ( 0 (cid:3) no discernible association ; 7 (cid:3) extremely strong link ) , and these ratings were used to as - sign trials to the strong and weak association conditions used in Analysis 1 . Mean associa - tion strength for the strong association condi - tion was 5 . 46 on a 7 point scale , while the mean association strength for weak associations was 4 . 70 . We also supplemented this categorical comparison of strong - and weak - association trialsinAnalysis1withaparametricanalysisofassociativestrength ( Analysis 2 ; details below ) . Thecontrastofweakversusstrongassociationshasbeenusedinmanyinvestigationsofseman - tic control : it reliably activates pMTG along with LIFG in fMRI studies ( Badre et al . , 2005 ; Noonan et al . , 2013 ) , and TMS to both LIFG and pMTG disrupts the retrieval of weak but not strong semantic associations ( Whitney et al . , 2011b ) , suggesting they both play a causal role in shaping semantic retrieval . Given these findings , wepredictedthatthedisruptiveeffect of TMS would be inversely related to the strength of association between the probe and target concepts for pMTG but not AG . In the identity - matching task , participants selected a target name for each probe picture . These judgments did not require participants to retrieve information about the context in which the probe objects were found or used ; thus , if AG and / or pMTG specifically support thematic knowledge , thistaskshouldnotshowaneffectofTMS ( atleastnotabove andbeyondanynonspecificeffectsofstimulation ) . Wevariedthelevelof specificity at which items were identified , as follows : participants had to match a photograph of an object ( e . g . , a specific type of dog ) to its superordinate label ( animal ) or to a more specific term ( i . e . , Alsatian ) . Specific - level matching requires similar representations with overlap - ping features to be distinguished ( e . g . , separation of the Alsatian from other breeds of dog ) . This task is impaired at an early stage in semantic dementia patients with ATL atrophy , as the distinguishing features of objects are lost ( McClelland and Rogers , 2003 ; Rogers and McClelland , 2004 ; Patterson et al . , 2007 ) . As a result , we envisage that the stimulation of sites involved in the representation or retrieval of detailed conceptual information would likely disrupt specific - level matching more than superordinate - levelmatching . Identity - matchingtasksalsorequiresome control over conceptual retrieval , although this might influence specific andsuperordinatetrialsindifferentways . Specifictrialsrequiretargetsto be selected from a set of similar concepts , eliciting competition that might be stronger than that in superordinate trials ( Rogers et al . , 2015 ) . However , superordinate trials involve a weaker match between the fea - tures in the picture and those activated by the target word ( i . e . , animal ) ; therefore , semantic retrieval to superordinate labels might also require “shaping” to suit the demands of the task . As a consequence , we might expect stimulation to pMTG to disrupt both superordinate and specific matching if this region makes a critical contribution to different facets of semantic control , as suggested by Noonan et al . ( 2013 ) . Given the proximity of pMTG and AG to brain regions supporting aspects of visual processing and attention , we included a nonsemantic control task with perceptual and decision - making demands that are sim - ilartothesemanticjudgments . Thestimuliwerepixelatedandscrambled black - and - white photographs ( initially of faces ; Krieger - Redwood , 2012 ) . Participants were asked to find targets that were identical to the probe ; the distracters were the same images rotated by 180° or 270° . Task difficulty . Since our focus is on a functional dissociation between AG and pMTG , task difficulty is not able explain the full pattern of TMS results across sites . However , tasks requiring more controlled retrieval should have longer response times ( RTs ) and potentially lower accuracy than more automatic semantic judgments . In line with these predictions , responseefficiencyinbaselinesessionsforallsites ( i . e . , RTdividedbythe proportion of trials correct ) was poorer for weak than strong thematic associations in the absence of TMS ( Table 1 ; efficiency for strong associ - ations (cid:3) 1361 . 2 ; efficiency for weak associations (cid:3) 1845 . 3 ; t ( 20 ) (cid:3) 17 . 51 , p (cid:2) 0 . 001 ) . Thematic association judgments were also more difficult than trials involving identity matching ( t ( 41 ) (cid:3) 10 . 41 , p (cid:2) 0 . 001 ) . Within the identity - matching task , superordinate trials ( mean efficiency (cid:3) 1158 . 7 ) were somewhat easier than specific trials overall ( mean effi - ciency (cid:3) 1203 . 0 ; t ( 20 ) (cid:3) 2 . 34 , p (cid:3) 0 . 030 ) . However , as can be seen in Table 1 , specific judgments tended to be faster yet less accurate than superordinate ones . Participants .

Stimuli . Threehundredeighteencolorphotographs , collectedthrough aninternetsearchengine ( Google ) , wereusedinthesemantictasks ( with the same probes used across the different judgment types ) . All images were resized to 200 (cid:4) 200 pixels while maintaining the aspect ratio of the initial image to prevent distortions . Two hundred sixty - two images of faces were pixelated and scrambled for the visual control task ( Krieger - Redwood , 2012 ) . In the semantic tasks , these images were presented alongside target nouns , which were either the names of natural / man - made objects at different levels of specificity or concrete associates of the object . The distracters in the thematic matching task were associates taken from other trials ( carefully selected to ensure that they were not linked to the probe ) . For the thematic association trials , we gathered ratings of association strength between the target and probe from 28 participants and these were used as a continuous variable in a parametric analysis of reaction time as a function of association strength and TMS ( see Analysis 2 ) . In addition , a set of nine participants rated all of the target concepts for familiarityona7pointscale . Forthesetargets , wealsoobtainedcountsof lexical frequency using the SUBTLEX - UK database ( van Heuven et al . , 2014 ) and polysemy using WordNet ( Fellbaum , 1998 ) . Thus , in Analysis 2 , we were able to statistically control for the familiarity of the target concept , plus the lexical frequency of the words used to denote this concept , and the variability of the meaning of the target concept . In Analysis 3 of the identity - matching task , the same superordinate target words were repeated many times across trials . Therefore , in this analysis , westatisticallycontrolledforconceptualvariablesrelatingtotheprobeasopposedtopsycholinguisticvariablesrelatedtothetarget . We collected typicality ratings for each probe concept from 15 participants , who were asked to judge on a 7 point scale whether each item ( denoted by its specific verbal label ) was a good example of its superordinate category using the methods of Rosch ( 1975 ) . We also collected familiarity ratings , on a 7 point scale , for each probe concept from nine participants . In all cases , the participants providing these ratings did not take part in the TMS experiment . Procedure . Structural T - 1 MRI scans ( 3D FSPGR MRI ) were coregistered to the scalp using Brainsight ( Rogue Research , https : / / www . rogue - research . com ) to identify the stimulation targets in each participant’s brain . Scalp measurements were made to determine the location of the vertex . At the beginning of each session , each partici - pant’s active motor threshold was established , determined as the low - est stimulation intensity needed to cause a contraction of the first dorsal interosseous muscle of the right hand when stimulating left motor cortex ( average motor threshold , 61 % ; motor threshold range , 29 % ; average stimulator output , 73 % ) . TMS stimulation was deliv - ered using an 8 mm figure - of - eight coil , attached to a MagStim Rapid stimulator ( The Magstim Company Ltd ) . Repetitive trains of TMS were delivered at 1 Hz for 10 min , changing the coil after 5 min . Stimulation intensity was set at 120 % of a participant’s individual motor threshold and capped at a maximum of 75 % of stimulator output . Coil orientation was adjusted to produce the most comfort - able stimulation for participants . Tasks were presented on a Windows PC running E - prime 2 . 0 ( Psy - chology Software Tools ) . Each session started with a set of 20 practice trials . Per session , there were four blocks of trials after TMS and at base - line ( i . e . , in the absence of TMS ) . The blocks were divided into mini - blocks containing 20 trials for each of the identity - matching and thematic matching conditions ( with these split into 10 high - association / low - association thematic trials and 10 superordinate / specific trials ) , and 10 trials for the visual control task ( i . e . , 50 trials in all per block ; 40 trials per condition across blocks ) . The order of conditions and stimuli was counterbalanced across participants and experimental sessions . No trials were repeated within a session , and 7 . 5 % of trials were repeated across sessions to ensure that there were equal numbers of trials per TMS session . Repeated trials were coded as dummy trials and removed before analysis . Tasks started with a prompt to remind the participant what feature they had to match ( identity (cid:3) match the picture with its name ; association (cid:3) match the picture to a thematically associated item ; vi - sual (cid:3) match the top picture to an identical but rotated target picture ) . For all tasks , the three response options appeared 900 ms before the probe image , which stayed on screen for a maximum of 3000 ms after the presentation of the response image or until the participant made their response . Participants pressed 1 , 2 , or 3 to indicate their selection of targets on the left , middle , and bottom of the screen . Statistical analysis . Behavioral data were analyzed using hierarchical linear modeling in SAS version 9 . 3 ( SAS Institute ) . Accuracy data were analyzedusingPROCGLIMIX , butthisanalysisdidnotrevealsignificant effects of TMS and is not discussed further . Thus , the analyses below focus on RT , which was analyzed using PROC MIXED with maximum likelihood as the estimation method and an “unstructured” variance – covariance structure specified for the random effects . Incorrect trials wereremovedbeforeanalysis , aswereoutlyingresponsesthatfell (cid:5) 2SDs from each participant’s mean for that condition . Results Analysis 1 : omnibus model This analysis examined the effects of TMS for each site and con - dition . It included the following three categorical fixed effects : ( 1 ) condition , with five levels , superordinate identity matching ( for the overarching category labels animal , weapon , food , vehicle , plant , clothes , household item , footwear , tree , instrument , and sports equipment ) , specific identity matching ( using the names of individual objects ) , thematic association matching for strong probe – target pairings , thematic association matching for weaker probe – target pairings , and visual matching for meaningless im - ages ; ( 2 ) stimulation site with the four levels vertex , AG , pMTG , and ATL ( although no significant behavioral disruption was ob - served following TMS to ATL , the data were included in the omnibus model to optimize estimates of RT in each condition in the absence of TMS ) ; and ( 3 ) TMS with two levels , baseline and post - TMS . We fitted a fully saturated model in which random variation for the intercept was allowed for subject , target , and Figure 2 . Examples of the identity judgments at different levels of specificity , and with thematic judgments tapping strong and weak associations . For both tasks , target words are underlined .

This allowed us to estimate pairwise comparisons of the least squared ( LS ) mean reaction times , with and without TMS , controlling for multiple comparisons , separately at each site for each condition ( a total of 26 , 001 observations ) . Table 1 shows the mean RT and the accuracy for each condi - tion for each site , as a function of TMS . Table 2 shows the out - comes of the multiple pairwise comparisons derived from the omnibus model . As expected , we found no significant TMS ef - fects at vertex ( the nonsemantic control site ) . AG showed signif - icant TMS effects for specific identity matching , strong and weak thematic associations , and visual decisions . pMTG showed sig - nificant TMS effects for superordinate and specific identity matching , and visual decisions , and a marginal effect for weak thematic associations . Since TMS to both AG and pMTG dis - rupted identity and thematic association matching , neither site showed the profile expected for a thematic hub ( i . e . , specific dis - ruption of semantic associations ) . However , since stimulation to these sites disrupted visual - matching as well as semantic deci - sions , it might be that neighboring cortical regions were also influenced by the stimulation or that the function of pMTG / AG is not restricted to the semantic domain but extends to visual and / or executive aspects of cognition ( a view that is compatible with the existing literature ; for comparison , see Humphreys and Lambon Ralph , 2014 ) . For this reason , we included the TMS effect for the visual task ( per participant and session ) as a covari - ate of no interest in subsequent analyses examining association strength and specificity . Analysis 2 : association strength as a continuous variable This analysis examined the effects of associative strength for the thematic matching task in more detail . We fitted a fully saturated model to estimate the fixed effects of TMS ( stimulation vs no stimulation ) , site ( pMTG , AG ) , and associative strength ( mod - eled as a continuous variable ) on RT , with subject and target as random effects . This model was computed twice : first , statisti - cally controlling for target lexical frequency , polysemy , and rated conceptual familiarity ( Analysis 2a ; 3648 observations ) ; and , sec - ond , controlling for the effects of TMS on the visual task , by entering the LS means estimates of this nonsemantic TMS effect , per participant and per site , as a covariate ( Analysis 2b ; 4773 observations ) . We predicted that TMS to pMTG would only dis - rupt the weakest association trials , while TMS to AG might dis - rupt stronger thematic associations . Figure 3 shows the predicted RT values at different levels of associative strength while controlling for all other sources of vari - ance in the model ( Analysis 2a ) . Point comparisons were com - puted for the LS means with and without TMS at six different levels of associative strength ( ranging from 1 . 5 to 6 . 5 on a 7 point scale ) . These comparisons , corrected for multiple comparisons , confirmed our predictions . Stimulation to pMTG caused a spe - cific disruption for weakly associated items , while stimulation to AG disrupted strong - association trials . These effects were ob - served at both sites even when the disruption to the visual trials was entered as a covariate ( Analysis 2b ; i . e . , the disruption of nonsemantic decisions was not sufficient to explain the impair - ment of semantic performance ; Table 3 ) . This dissociation be - tween pMTG and AG in the thematic association - matching task is consistent with their hypothesized role in more controlled and automatic aspects of semantic retrieval , respectively .

We fitted a fully saturated model to estimate the fixed effects of TMS ( stimulation vs no stimulation ) , site ( pMTG , AG ) , and specificity ( superordinate vs specific ) , with subject and target as random effects . This model was com - puted twice : first , statistically controlling for concept typical - ity and familiarity ( Analysis 3a ; 4368 observations ) ; and , second , controlling for the effects of TMS on the visual task by entering the LS means estimates of this nonsemantic TMS effect , per participant and per site , as a covariate ( Analysis 3b ; 5091 observations ) . Figure 4 shows the predicted RT values for superordinate and specific identity matching while controlling for all other sources of variance in the model ( Analysis 3a ) . Paired contrasts , corrected for multiple comparisons ( Fig . 4 , Table 4 ) , revealed that TMS to AG disrupted identity matching at the specific but not at the superordi - nate level , suggesting that this site plays a necessary role in precise semantic retrieval that differentiates highly similar concepts that share many features . In contrast , stimulation of pMTG elicited sig - nificant disruption for both the specific and superordinate trials , demonstrating a functional dissociation for these two sites on a sec - ond task . A similar pattern was seen when the visual TMS effect for each participant and each site was added as a covariate of no interest ( Analysis 3b ) . Thus , AG and pMTG appear to contribute to aspects of semantic cognition beyond the storage and / or retrieval of the - matic associations , even when general effects on nonsemantic visual processing are taken into account . Discussion This study examined the following two contrasting hypotheses about the role of AG and pMTG : ( 1 ) by one view , these sites store semantic information about thematic associations and events but are not critical for identity matching ( compare with Figure3 .

TMS was applied to peaks taken from two meta - analyses of semantic cognition examin - ing ( 1 ) semantic over nonsemantic tasks matched for diffi - culty ( Binder et al . , 2009 ; peak in mid - AG ) ; and ( 2 ) semantic decisions with high and low control demands ( Noonan et al . , 2013 ; peak in pMTG ) . We measured the effects of this stimu - lation on identity matching ( at superordinate and specific levels ) and thematic matching ( for weak and strong associa - tions ) . The results show that AG and pMTG make dissociable contributions to semantic cognition , which is consistent with a theoretical model in which pMTG ( alongside LIFG ) under - pins controlled aspects of semantic retrieval . In contrast , AG ( alongside ATL ) supports more automatic processes that are critical to the retrieval of specific concepts . Without any control over the retrieval of knowledge , semantic processing is dominated by spreading activation between strongly linked concepts , yet we show a high degree of flexibility in the information we retrieve—we can selectively focus on non - dominant aspects of meaning when required to do so by a task . Coactivation of pMTG and LIFG has been linked to this type of controlled semantic retrieval ( Jefferies , 2013 ; Noonan et al . , 2013 ) . For example , when asked to recover an unusual the - matic association between weakly associated concepts ( e . g . , Alsatian and razor wire ) , dominant features / associations are largely irrelevant ( i . e . , “pet” ) , yet we can bring these disparate concepts together by focusing on features that are relevant to establishing a connection ( e . g . , “fierce” ) . Studies examining neural responses to weak over strong semantic associations , and ambiguous over unambiguous words , implicate pMTG and LIFG in this type of controlled shaping of semantic re - trieval ( Badre et al . , 2005 ; Whitney et al . , 2011a , b ; Noonan et al . , 2013 ) . Moreover , damage to either LIFG or posterior tem - poral areas , including pMTG in patients with SA , is associated with deregulated semantic retrieval that is characterized by a tendency to retrieve dominant features and associations , even when these are irrelevant to the current task or context ( Jef - feries and Lambon Ralph , 2006 ; Noonan et al . , 2010 ) . Thus , our finding that the stimulation of pMTG disrupted judg - ments about weak but not strong thematic associations adds Figure4 .

We also found that stimulation of pMTG disrupted identity matching for both specific and superordinate trials . This result is not unexpected given that these judgments also involved con - trolled retrieval . Specific identity matching requires selection of a target concept from among highly similar items ; therefore , con - trol processes might have been engaged to overcome competi - tion . Superordinate identity matching involves terms like “animal” that have variable meanings across contexts . For these items , automatic spreading activation is not expected to strongly overlap with the features visible in the probe picture , and thus control processes may be engaged to tailor retrieval from the words to suit the demands of the task . Consistent with this ac - count , SA patients have deficits on both identity - matching and thematic matching tasks that reflect the control requirements of these judgments ( Noonan et al . , 2010 ; Rogers et al . , 2015 ) . In summary , although pMTG activation continues to be interpreted in terms of a semantic store ( Binder et al . , 2009 ; Martin et al . , 2014 ) , multiple studies using complementary methods have noted responses incompatible with a role in passive storage and suggest instead that pMTG allows for the controlled retrieval of semantic activation ( Gold et al . , 2005 ; Whitney et al . , 2011b ; Jefferies , 2013 ; Noonan et al . , 2013 ) . The mid - AG site demonstrated a different response profile from pMTG ; TMS to AG elicited greater disruption of strongly related thematic associations , which is in line with the proposal thatthissitecontributestomoreautomaticformsofretrieval . AG has several functional subdivisions ( Seghier et al . , 2010 ; Noonan et al . , 2013 ) , as follows : dorsal AG is associated with executive semantic processing , while the mid - AG region ( our TMS target site ) is typically characterized by task - related deactivation ( Seghier et al . , 2010 ; Wirth et al . , 2011 ; Humphreys and Lambon Ralph , 2014 ; i . e . , it forms part of the default - mode network ) . This deactivation is more pronounced for harder semantic and non - semantic tasks ( Binder et al . , 2003 ; Sabsevitz et al . , 2005 ; Hum - phreys et al . , 2015 ) , which is consistent with the view that this region does not facilitate executively demanding aspects of cog - nition . In contrast , it shows activation for tasks that involve the retrieval of internal representations , including automatic seman - tic tasks , episodic memory , numerical fact retrieval , and sentence comprehension ( Humphreys and Lambon Ralph , 2014 ) . Our observation of greater disruption for specific than subordinate - level identity matching following AG stimulation might also be explicable within this framework . For example , mid - AG could contribute to the reflexive ( automatic ) allocation of attention to activated concepts . Consequently , when a picture of a corgi is presented alongside different dog names , attention might be captured by the features of corgi that are activated in the semantic store . If TMS to AG results in less accurate allocation of attention , this could reduce the ability to distinguish between similar representations ( e . g . , corgi and Dalmatian in specific tri - als ) , but the ability to separate dogs from human - made objects in superordinate trials would be preserved . This proposal is consis - tent with the broader role of posterior inferior parietal regions in reflexive attention to memory ( Corbetta et al . , 2008 ; Hutchinson et al . , 2009 ) . Although this account is compatible with the current data , further research is needed to confirm this interpretation . TMS additionally disrupted a visual matching control task , and we statistically controlled for this effect in the analysis . Al - though our tasks and interpretation focus on the necessary contribution of mid - AG and pMTG to semantic cognition , the framework above does not preclude the possibility that these brain regions also contribute to nonsemantic processes , or lie adjacent to visual or executive regions that were influenced by stimulation in some of the participants . Although a recent meta - analysis examining semantic control found that pMTG made a relatively specific contribution to semantic decisions ( relative to phonologicaldecisions ; Noonanetal . , 2013 ) , itliesanteriortothe visual motion - processing area MT ( Malach et al . , 1995 ; Wallen - tin et al . , 2011 ) and immediately above ventral occipital – tempo - ral areas coupled to the frontoparietal control system ( Duncan , 2010 ; Yeo et al . , 2011 ) . Similarly , AG is engaged in many nonse - mantic tasks , and there is an anterior - to - posterior transition from stimulus - driven attention in supramarginal gyrus to se - mantics in AG ( Humphreys and Lambon Ralph , 2014 ) . TMS - induced disruption of these processes might account for effects on the visual - matching task . The current study focused on the functional differentiation of pMTG and AG , yet , as noted in the Introduction , these sites are similarly recruited by “event semantics” and “thematic judg - ments” ( Schwartz et al . , 2011 ; de Zubicaray et al . , 2013 ) . The two - hub account proposes that one or both of these sites repre - sent thematic associations as opposed to the concrete features of objects . This proposal was originally motivated by the observa - tion that patients with temporoparietal stroke make thematic errors in picture naming ( e . g . , “squirrel” ¡ “nuts” ) , unlike those withATLdamage ( JefferiesandLambonRalph , 2006 ; Schwartzet al . , 2011 ) . However , this inappropriate production of associa - tions in picture naming might reflect intact thematic knowledge but a deficit in the ability to constrain semantic retrieval , which is in line with these patients’ deficits in semantic control ( Jefferies and Lambon Ralph , 2006 ; Noonan et al . , 2010 ) . The current find - ings are largely inconsistent with the predictions of the two - hub account since TMS to both sites disrupted identity as well as thematic matching , even after the nonspecific effects of TMS to thesesiteswastakenintoaccount . Giventhateventscanhavevery different meanings in different contexts ( e . g . , kicking ball : on a field (cid:3) game vs in a greenhouse (cid:3) vandalism ) , the contribution of pMTG to action / event understanding might follow from its role in shaping retrieval in line with the current context . In con - trast , AG might play a critical role in the orientation of attention toward specific event representations and / or maintain a focus of attention across a sequence of interacting concepts ( Humphreys and Lambon Ralph , 2014 ) . To conclude , although semantic contrasts can activate pMTG and mid - AG as a single cluster ( Binder et al . , 2009 ) , we propose that these sites should not be interpreted narrowly in terms of supporting specific aspects of semantic knowledge—instead , they are implicated within distinct large - scale cortical networks , which support retrieval processes crucial for semantics and also other aspects of cognition . Our two stimulation sites have differ - ent functional connectivity profiles revealed by resting - state fMRI ( Fig . 1 ) ; mid - AG has strong connections to ATL ( Ruschel et al . , 2014 ) and to posterior cingulate and ventromedial prefrontal cortex implicated in the default mode network ( Uddin et al . , 2010 ) . In contrast , pMTG shows strong connectivity to LIFG , implicated in semantic control ( Koopmans et al . , 2012 ) . These different patterns of connectivity support our conclusions that mid - AG is implicated in automatic aspects of retrieval , while pMTG contributes to controlled retrieval .
