ABSTRACT Earlier reports demonstrated that Cofilin expression is increased in bladder cancer samples , though its function remains unknown . Here , we found that Cofilin 1 expression was higher in bladder cancer tissues than in paracancerous tissues . Overexpression of Cofilin 1 promoted , while Cofilin 1 knockdown inhibited , proliferation , migration , and invasion in the T24 and RT4 bladder cancer cell lines . In addition , Cofilin 1 overexpression increased , while Cofilin 1 knockdown decreased , bladder tumor volumes in mouse xenograft experiments . Transcription factor 7 - like 2 ( TCF7L2 ) targeted the promoter of the Cofilin 1 gene , and TCF7L2 knockdown or mutations in the Cofilin 1 promoter dramatically decreased Cofilin 1 transcription . TCF7L2 promoted cell proliferation and migration and increased Cofilin 1 protein levels in RT4 and T24 cells . Thus , TCF7L2 contributed to Cofilin 1 - induced promotion of bladder cancer development by binding to the Cofilin 1 promoter and increasing its expression . INTRODUCTION Human bladder cancer is one of the most common malignancies worldwide and has high recurrence rates [ 1 , 2 ] . Genetic susceptibility , tobacco smoking , occupational exposure to carcinogens ( such as aromatic amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ) , dietary factors , and environmental pollution increase the risk of developing bladder cancer [ 1 , 3 ] . Diagnosis and treatment of bladder cancer is very expensive [ 4 ] . Several markers , including nuclear matrix protein 22 , telomerase , and epidermal growth factor receptor , have been used to detect bladder cancer [ 5 – 7 ] . However , the specificities and / or sensitivities of these markers are not high enough to detect bladder cancer early or to track its progression [ 5 , 8 ] . The discovery of novel markers or targets could greatly improve diagnosis and treatment of bladder cancer . Cofilin , an actin depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) , is expressed in various cells and regulates the formation of actin filaments by mediating polymerization and depolymerization [ 9 ] . High levels of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , which contribute to cancer development , alter Cofilin expression in vascular smooth muscle [ 10 ] . Cofilin also contributes to cancer development and tumor cell invasion and is a marker for breast cancer [ 11 ] . Increased Cofilin levels are associated with increases in tumor cell motility and carcinoma progression [ 12 ] . Proteomics analysis revealed that Cofilin expression is also increased in bladder cancer samples [ 8 , 13 ] . Increased expression and phosphorylation of Cofilin might impact the development and invasiveness of bladder cancer as well [ 14 ] . In mammals , there are three different ADFs / Cofilins : Cofilin 1 , Cofilin 2 , and ADF [ 9 ] . Cofilin 1 is expressed in most embryonic and adult mammalian cells , Cofilin 2 is www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget / Oncotarget , 2017 , Vol . 8 , ( No . 54 ) , pp : 92043 - 92054 Research Paper Oncotarget 92044 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget expressed in muscle cells , and ADF is restricted to epithelia and endothelia [ 9 ] . Cofilin 1 , the non - muscle isoform of the cofilin 1 gene product , plays a key role in cell migration and cytokinesis and is directly associated with the invasion , metastasis , and chemoresistance of various human malignant solid tumors [ 11 , 15 , 16 , 17 ] . Protein kinase D1 ( PKD 1 ) enhances phosphorylation and de - phosphorylates Cofilin 1 to maintain it in its inactive form [ 18 , 19 ] . Transcription factor 7 - like 2 ( TCF7L2 ) and β - catenin levels were lower in cells overexpressing PKD 1 than in control cells [ 20 ] . β - catenin / TCF7L2 transcription complex levels were also decreased in PKD 1 overexpression cells compared to control cells [ 20 ] . The effects of Cofilin 1 on cancer development and progression therefore depend on its activation status , which is regulated by PKD 1 and TCF7L2 . We suspect that Cofilin 1 is regulated by TCF7L2 and affects the development of bladder cancer . TCF7L2 microsatellite instability and the expression of different splice forms occur in human bladder cancer cells , suggesting that the TCF7L2 - mediated signal pathway affects bladder cancer progression [ 21 ] . TCF7L2 , also known as TCF 4 , regulates the transcription of numerous genes targeted by the Wnt signaling pathway [ 22 ] . Tiling array analysis and ChIP - PCR identified miR - 21 as a candidate target of TCF7L2 [ 22 ] . miR - 21 was up - regulated in bladder cancer tissues [ 23 ] . Together , these results suggest that TCF7L2 mediates bladder cancer progression [ 24 ] . In addition , the Wnt signaling pathway regulates bladder cancer metastasis by activating matrix metallopeptidase 9 ( MMP 9 ) [ 25 ] . Inhibition of Wnt inhibitory factor - 1 , an inhibitor of the Wnt signaling pathway , is also ubiquitous in bladder cancer [ 24 ] . Here , we studied the effects of Cofilin 1 and TCF7L2 on bladder cancer . First , we measured Cofilin 1 expression in bladder cancer and paracancerous tissues and in the T24 and RT4 bladder cancer cell lines . The effects of TCF7L2 on Cofilin 1 protein expression were also examined . We then investigated the effects of Cofilin 1 on cell proliferation , apoptosis , cell cycle progression , adhesion , migration , and invasion . ChIP and luciferase assays were used to identify factors that regulated Cofilin 1 activity . Finally , the functions of Cofilin 1 in bladder cancer were confirmed in animal experiments . The results revealed that Cofilin 1 , which was regulated by TCF7L2 , promoted bladder cancer development . RESULTS Cofilin 1 expression in bladder cancer tissues and cells Cofilin 1 mRNA expression in bladder cancer tissues and corresponding paracancerous tissues as well as T24 and RT4 bladder cancer cells was measured using RT - PCR . Cofilin 1 mRNA expression was higher in bladder cancer tissues than in corresponding paracancerous tissues ( Figure 1A ) . WB and IHC revealed that Cofilin 1 protein levels were higher in bladder cancer tissues than in corresponding paracancerous tissues ( Figure 1B and 1C ) . Cofilin 1 expression in the si - Cofilin 1 group was about 25 % of that in control group , indicating that Cofilin 1 knockdown was successful ( Supplementary Figure 1 ) . Cofilin 1 expression increased by 100 % in cells transfected with Cofilin 1 plasmid compared to the control group ( Supplementary Figure 1 ) . Cofilin 1 promotes cell growth and proliferation To investigate the function of Cofilin in bladder cancer , we transfected cell lines with vector expressing Cofilin 1 or with siRNA to knockdown Cofilin 1 . OD450 values were then measured and used to calculate cell proliferation rates ( Figure 2A - 2D ) . Cofilin 1 overexpression increased OD450 values and proliferation rates , while Cofilin 1 knockdown decreased OD450 values and inhibited proliferation , in T24 and RT4 cells . To further investigate the effects of Cofilin 1 on cell growth , the clonogenic capacity of T24 and RT4 cells was evaluated in a colony formation assay ( Figure 2E and 2F ) . Cofilin 1 overexpression increased holoclone establishment in T24 and RT4 cells , while siRNA - induced Cofilin 1 knockdown markedly inhibited clonogenic capacity in both cell lines . These results suggest that Cofilin 1 promotes cell proliferation . Cofilin 1 inhibits apoptosis and promotes cell cycle progression To determine the effects of Cofilin 1 on cell death , apoptosis of T24 and RT4 cells transfected with Cofilin 1 and si - Cofilin 1 vectors was measured using flow cytometry ( Figure 3A and 3B ) . Treatment - dependent shifts in cell populations clearly indicated that apoptosis rates in the si - Cofilin 1 - treated group , which increased 1 . 6 - fold compared to the control group , were higher than those of both the Cofilin 1 and control groups . In contrast , Cofilin 1 overexpression decreased the apoptosis rate to 80 % of the control group rate . These results suggest that Cofilin 1 knockdown promoted , while Cofilin 1 overexpression inhibited , cell apoptosis . We then examined the effects of Cofilin 1 on cell cycle progression in T24 and RT4 cells using flow cytometry ( Figure 3C and 3D ) . The G1 phase cell population was lower in Cofilin 1 group than in the control and si - Cofilin 1 groups , suggesting that Cofilin 1 overexpression promoted cell cycle progression . This result was in line with the observation that Cofilin 1 overexpression promoted cell proliferation . In addition , the G1 population was higher in the si - Cofilin 1 group than in the control and Cofilin 1 groups , which indicated that Cofilin 1 knockdown arrested the cell cycle in G1 phase . This result was consistent with the finding that Oncotarget 92045 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget Figure 1 : Cofilin 1 expression in bladder cancer and corresponding paracancerous tissues . ( A , B ) Cofilin 1 mRNA and protein expression in bladder cancer ( T ) and paracancerous ( P ) tissues was detected by RT - PCR and WB . ( C ) Cofilin 1 expression in bladder cancer , glandular cystitis ( GC ) , and paracancerous tissues was detected by WB and IHC . Oncotarget 92046 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget Cofilin 1 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation . Cofilin 1 thus promoted cell proliferation and survival . Cofilin 1 promotes cell migration , invasion , and adhesion Migration and invasion assays were performed to examine the effects of Cofilin 1 on these processes in T24 and RT4 cells . The cell invasion assay was similar to the cell migration assay , but also required cells to migrate through Matrigel to be considered invasive . Numbers of migrated and invaded cells were higher in the Cofilin 1 group than in the control and si - Cofilin 1 groups , which suggests that Cofilin 1 overexpression enhanced cell migration and invasion ( Figure 3E - 3H and Supplementary Figures 2 and 3 ) . Furthermore , numbers of migrated and invaded cells were lower in the si - Cofilin 1 group than in the control group , which indicated that Cofilin 1 knockdown reduced cellular migration and invasion capacity . Numbers of migrated and invaded cells were higher in all groups for T24 cells than for RT4 cells . Next , we evaluated the ability of T24 and RT4 cells to adhere to Fibronectin ( Fn ) ( Figure 3I and 3J ) . Compared to the control group , adhesion capability at 2 hours increased in Cofilin 1 group and decreased in the si - Cofilin 1 group for all cells . These results indicated that Cofilin 1 improved cell adhesion capacities . Transcription factor 7 - like 2 ( TCF7L2 ) regulates Cofilin 1 expression We predicted that TCF7L2 bound to the Cofilin 1 promoter region ; ChIP and luciferase reporter assays were used to confirm this prediction ( Figure 4 ) . The Cofilin 1 promoter sequence is shown in Figure 4A . Two primer pairs were designed targeting different sites ( Figure 4A ) ; the results of PCR amplification with the F1 / R1 and F2 / R2 primers are shown in Figure 4B - 4D , respectively . Treatment with the TCF7L2 antibody and the F1 / R1 primers resulted in a band of the same size as the input , while no band was observed for samples treated with IgG instead of Ab and the F2 / R2 primers . These results indicated that TCF7L2 bound to the promoter region of Cofilin 1 . The luciferase reporter assay further confirmed that TCF7L2 regulated Cofilin 1 expression ( Figure 4E ) . Luciferase signal strength did not differ between the pGL3 - basis - TCF7L2 - siRNA and Figure 2 : Cofilin 1 promotes cell growth . ( A and C ) Effects of Cofilin 1 on cell growth .

Oncotarget 92047 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget pGL3 - basis - NC groups . However , luciferase signal strength was 3 . 6 times higher in the Cofilin 1 - NC group than in the mutCofilin 1 - promoter - NC group , which suggests that the Cofilin 1 promoter indeed induced fluorescein expression . In addition , the luciferase signal strength was 3 . 6 times higher in the Cofilin 1 - NC group than in the Cofilin 1 - si - TCF7L2 group , which suggests that siRNA - induced downregulation of TCF7L2 decreased luciferase signal strength . The luciferase signal strength for the mutCofilin 1 - promoter - NC group was similar to that of the Cofilin 1 - si - TCF7L2 group . Finally , luciferase signal strength in the Cofilin 1 - NC and Cofilin 1 - si - TCF7L2 groups was 2 . 8 times that of the mutCofilin 1 - promoter - si - TCF7L2 group . Together , these results suggest that TCF7L2 bound to the promoter region of Cofilin 1 and further reduced fluorescein expression . TCF7L2 promoted cofilin 1 protein expression As shown in Figure 5 , Cofilin 1 protein expression was regulated by TCF7L2 in T24 and RT4 cells . Compared to the control group , Cofilin 1 protein expression was increased in the TCF7L2 group and decreased in the si - TCF7L2 group in both T24 and RT4 cells . These results confirmed that upregulation or downregulation of TCF7L2 resulted in upregulation or downregulation of Cofilin 1 , respectively . Cofilin 1 promoted bladder tumor growth in vivo To investigate the effect of Cofilin 1 on tumorigenesis , we established a BALB / c nude mouse xenograft model using T24 and RT4 cells . The T24 and Figure 3 : Cofilin 1 inhibits apoptosis and promotes cell cycle progression , migration , invasion , and adhesion . ( A and B ) Apoptosis analysis for T24 and RT4 cells transfected with different vectors .

Oncotarget 92048 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget RT4 cells were pre - transfected with Cofilin 1 , si - Cofilin 1 , or NC vectors . These cells were then injected into female BALB / c nude mice to form tumors . Tumor volumes were measured every 2 or 3 days for 29 days ( Figure 6A and 6B ) . Tumor volumes were higher in mice injected with T24 or RT4 cells overexpressing Cofilin 1 than in the control group ( NC group ) . Tumor volumes were lower in mice injected with Cofilin 1 knockdown T24 and RT4 cells ( si - Cofilin 1 ) than that in the control group ( NC group ) . These results indicate that Cofilin 1 increased the tumorigenicity of T24 and RT4 cells in the nude mouse xenograft model . Tumor volumes were larger in mice injected with T24 cells than in the corresponding groups injected with RT4 cells , which further confirmed that T24 cells had stronger migration and invasion capabilities than RT4 cells . Representative photographs of bladder cancer tissues in the nude mice are shown in Figure 6C and 6D . Together , these results suggest that Cofilin 1 indeed promoted bladder cancer formation in vivo . DISCUSSION In this study , we found that Cofilin 1 expression was higher in bladder cancer tissues than in paracancerous tissues , which is consistent with previous results [ 32 ] . We also examined the effects of Cofilin 1 in the T24 and RT4 bladder cancer cell lines . Cofilin 1 promoted proliferation and decreased apoptosis in T24 and RT4 cells . Furthermore , Cofilin 1 overexpression promoted cell cycle progression , Figure 4 : ChIP assay of T24 and RT4 cells . ( A ) The sequence of the Cofilin 1 promotor region .

Relative luciferase activity was calculated as follows : ( Rluc miRNA / Luc miRNA ) / ( Rluc no - target / Luc nontarget ) . TCF7L2 knockdown ( si - TCF7L2 ) or mutCofilin 1 - promotor decreased luciferase activity . The data are presented as the means of three independent experiments , * * p < 0 . 01 . Oncotarget 92049 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget while Cofilin 1 knockdown resulted in G1 phase arrest , which confirmed that Cofilin 1 promoted cell proliferation ; however , this result contradicts previous results regarding the effects of Cofilin 1 on the cell cycle [ 33 , 34 ] . Cofilin 1 enhanced the migration and invasion capacities of T24 and RT4 cells , indicating that Cofilin 1 contributes to invasion and metastasis in bladder tumors as well as in mammary tumors [ 13 , 17 , 35 ] . Cofilin 1 also promoted bladder cancer growth in mouse xenograft experiments . Together , these results and previous studies suggest that Cofilin 1 may be a therapeutic target for bladder cancer [ 8 , 32 ] . ChIP and luciferase assays demonstrated that the transcription factor TCF7L2 bound to the promoter region of Cofilin 1 to regulate its expression . TCF7L2 knockdown decreased Cofilin 1 protein expression , while upregulation of TCF7L2 increased Cofilin 1 protein expression . In addition , TCF7L2 promoted proliferation and migration in RT4 and T24 cells . Together , these results indicate that Cofilin 1 , which is regulated by TCF7L2 , promotes bladder cancer development and progression [ 22 , 25 , 24 ] . Cofilin 1 is located at 11q13 , a chromosome region that is associated with invasion , metastasis , and decreased survival in cancer patients [ 36 ] . Cofilin 1 is phosphorylated by LIM kinase or testicular protein kinase , which results in inactivation , and is dephosphorylated by Cofilin phosphatase Slingshot , which results in reactivation [ 18 , 19 , 20 , 37 ] . A previous study demonstrated that Cofilin 1 can transport G - actin and other proteins to the nucleus , which results in changes in gene expression that increase tumor cell proliferation and viability [ 38 ] . In addition , Cofilin 1 binds to F - actin and induces remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton , resulting in increased tumor cell motility , invasion , and metastasis [ 38 ] . PKD 1 inhibits depolymerization by promoting the phosphorylation or inhibiting the de - phosphorylation Cofilin 1 , which maintains it in its inactive form [ 18 , 19 ] . TCF7L2 and β - catenin levels , as well as β - catenin / TCF7L2 transcription complex levels , are decreased in PKD 1 overexpression cells compared to control cells [ 20 ] . Both TCF7L2 , which positively regulates Cofilin 1 protein expression and also binds to its own promoter , and Cofilin 1 are regulated by PKD1 . In this study , we confirmed that Cofilin 1 promoted the proliferation , migration , invasion , and adhesion capacities of T24 and RT4 bladder cancer cells while also inhibiting cell apoptosis . In addition , Cofilin 1 increased bladder tumor volumes . Furthermore , we discovered that transcription factor TCF7L2 bound to the Cofilin 1 promoter to increase its expression and promote the development of bladder cancer .

All procedures involving human participants were in performed accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and / or national research committees and the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments , or comparable ethical standards . We retrospectively reviewed data from patients admitted to the 3 institutions included in the study between January and December 2016 . Patients more than 18 years old with histologically - proven bladder cancer who had not received any chemotherapy or radiotherapy treatment were included . Patients underwent cystectomy , which included en bloc excision of the bladder as well as the prostate and seminal vesicles in men and the uterus , ovaries , and anterior vagina in women . None of the patients had distant metastases in the chest , abdomen , pelvis , or bones at the time of preoperative imaging . Patients who underwent conservative surgery or with different histological subtypes ( small cell variants , pure adenocarcinoma , or pure epidermoid carcinoma ) were excluded , while patients who received peri - operative chemotherapy were included . Characteristics of the bladder cancer patients are shown in Table 1 . Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) Total RNA and protein were extracted from the bladder cancer and paracancerous tissues using an extraction kit ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ; Keygen Biotech ) . For cell experiments , total RNA was extracted using the Trizol method . Cofilin 1 mRNA expression was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) . cDNA was synthesized using the PrimeScript II 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit ( Takara , Japan ) . The primer sequences used in the experiment were as follows : Cofilin 1 forward primer : 5’ TTGTGCGGCTCCTACTAA 3’ , Cofilin 1 reverse primer : 5’ TTGCATCATAGAGGGCATAG 3’ ; 18s rRNA forward primer : 5’ CCTGGATACCGCAGCTAGGA 3’ , 18s rRNA reverse prime : 5’ GCGGCGCAATACGAATGCCCC . Cofilin 1 mRNA expression was measured via RT - PCR using SYBR Green PC Master Mix ( Toyobo , Japan ) . Thermocycler conditions consisted of initial holds at 50ºC for 2 min and 95ºC for 5 min followed by a PCR program of 95ºC for 15 sec , 60ºC for 15 sec , and 72ºC for 30 sec for 40 cycles and a final hold at 72ºC for 5 sec . Reactions were performed on an ABI PRISM ® 7500 Sequence Detection System . Data for all samples was normalized to the control . Cofilin 1 mRNA expression was calculated using the relative quantification equation ( RQ = 2 - ΔΔCt ) [ 26 ] . Western blotting ( WB ) Cofilin 1 protein levels in cancer tissues , paracancerous tissues , and bladder cancer cells were evaluated by Western blotting ( WB ) . Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA Protein Assay Kit ( Keygen Biotech ) . Proteins were detected using a Cofilin 1 monoclonal antibody ( ab42824 , 1 : 1000 , Abcam , USA ) and a GAPDH polyclonal antibody ( AP0063 , 1 : 10 , 00 , Bioworld ) and then visualized using a commercial Immobilon Western HRP Substrate ( WBKLS0500 , Millipore , USA ) under dark conditions . Immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) Cofilin 1 protein expression in bladder cancer tissues and corresponding paracancerous tissues was evaluated by IHC with the 3’ , 3’ - diaminobenzidine ( DAB ) kit ( ZLI - 9017 , ZSGB - Bio , Beijing , China ) , which was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol . Cofilin 1 monoclonal antibody ( ab42824 , 1 : 200 , Abcam , USA ) and goat anti - rabbit HRP antibody ( ab136817 , 1 : 400 , Abcam , USA ) were used . Cell culture The T24 and RT4 human bladder cancer cell lines were obtained from LAND biology company ( Guangzhou , China ) . The cells were cultured using standard procedures and incubated at 37ºC with 5 % CO 2 . Knockdown of Cofilin 1 and TCF7L2 was performed using small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) . T24 and RT4 cells were transfected with siRNA or Cofilin 1 or TCF7L2 overexpression plasmid vectors using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen , USA ) according to the manufacturer’s protocol . Opti - MEM medium ( Invitrogen ) was used for transfection and was replaced with DEME medium after 4 - 6 h of incubation . Cell proliferation assay Cell proliferation was measured using the Cell Counting Kit - 8 ( CCK - 8 ) assay kit ( Dojindo , Kumamato , Japan ) . Absorbance was measured for all samples at 450 nm ( OD450 ) . Cell proliferation and inhibition rates were measured from day 0 through day 3 and were calculated based on OD450 values . Colony formation assays The clonogenic assay was performed as previously reported [ 27 ] . T24 and RT4 cells were plated at 100 cells / well in a 96 - well dishes and incubated for 7 days , after which medium was discarded , cells were washed with PBS 2 times , 200 μL of crystal violet staining solution were added , and cells were then gently washed with water and dried at room temperature . Samples were counted , Oncotarget 92052 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget photographed , and analyzed using the AID EliSpot iSpot Reader System ( AID , Germany ) . Cell cycle assay Cells were cultured for 48 h , then collected , fixed , and stained using standard procedures . The cells were stained with a propidium iodide ( PI ) solution containing 100 μg / mL PI and 50 μg / mL RNase ( Sigma , USA ) in PBS at 37ºC for 30 min in the dark . After cell clumps were removed by passing stained cells through a nylon mesh sieve , the samples were analyzed by flow cytometry ( BD , USA ) . Data were collected and analyzed using CELL Quest and ModFit LT software . Cell apoptosis analysis Cells were harvested and washed after 48 h of incubation . Cell apoptosis was analyzed using an Annexin V - FITC / PI Apoptosis Detection Kit ( Catalog no . KGA106 ; Nanjing Keygen Biotech Co . , Ltd ) according to manufacturer’s instructions . After staining , all samples were immediately measured on a FACSort flow cytometer ( BD , USA ) . The data were analyzed using Cell Quest 3 . 0 software ( BD , USA ) . Cell adhesion assay To analyze the adhesion of T24 and RT4 cells to an endothelial monolayer , Fibronectin ( Fn ) was seeded into a 96 - well plate . Cells formed a confluent monolayer within 2 days . Non - adherent cells were removed by washing with PBS . The adherent cells were quantified using the CCK - 8 kit as described for the cell proliferation assay . Migration and invasion assays The migration ability of T24 and RT4 cells was assessed using Transwell chambers ( BD , REF353097 ) according to the manufacturer’s protocol . Briefly , 1×10 5 cells were seeded in the upper chamber with serum - free medium . Cells were then allowed to migrate to the lower chamber containing 10 % fetal calf serum medium . After non - migratory cells remaining on the upper side of the filter were removed with a cotton swab , migratory cells attached to the underside of the filter were stained with 0 . 1 % crystal violet for 20 min at room temperature . The stain was eluted with 33 % acetic acid and cells were photographed after 48 h incubation . The absorbance at 570 nm ( OD570 ) was measured . Cells incubated in serum - free serum were added to Transwell chambers with a thin layer of Matrigel basement membrane matrix ( 8 mm pores ) ; 10 % fetal calf serum was added to the lower chamber . After noninvasive cells remaining on the upper side of the filter were removed with a cotton swab , invasive cells attached to the underside of the filter were stained with 0 . 1 % crystal violet for 20 min at room temperature . The stain was eluted with 33 % acetic acid and cells were photographed after 48 h incubation . The absorbance at 570 nm ( OD570 ) was measured . Chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) analysis TCF7L2 binding sites within the Cofilin 1 promoter were predicted using the Jaspar database ( http : / / jaspar . binf . ku . dk ) and then verified using the chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) method [ 28 , 29 ] . RT4 and T24 cells lysates were subjected to ChIP analysis conducted as previously described [ 30 ] . Briefly , 10 % of each sample was reserved as input , and the rest was immunoprecipitated with TCF7L2 antibody ; isotypic normal IgG was used as a negative control . ChIP was conducted with a ChIP kit ( Thermo , 26156 ) . DNA was extracted from the immunoprecipitated samples and subjected to analysis for Cofilin 1 promoter regions by PCR and 2 % w / v agarose gel electrophoresis . The reserved input for each sample was used as an internal control . DNA from each sample was used as a template for amplification of the last exon of Cofilin 1 to serve as a PCR negative control ; 32 cycles were used , as was the case for the promoter region PCR . The following Cofilin 1 primer pairs were used : forward primer 1 : 5′ GCGGGAGAGAAAAGAGTTAACTCC 3′ , reverse primer 1 : 5′ CAGCACTTCGGAGACGGGCTC 3′ ; forward primer 2 : 5′ ACCCTGTTCCCACCAGTTAGCC 3′ , reverse primer 2 : 5′ CAAGGCATAAACCTCCAGGAG 3′ as a negative control . Luciferase reporter assay The Cofilin 1 promoter fragment containing putative binding sites for TCF7L2 was obtained and ligated ( Takara , Japan ) into the digested pGL3 Luciferase reporter vector ( Promega , USA ) between the XhoI and NotI sites . Cofilin 1 promoter fragment site mutations were generated using the KOD - plus mutagenesis kit ( Toyobo , Japan ) according to the manufacturer’s protocol . RT4 cells were plated in a 96 - well plate and then co - transfected with pGL3 basic vector , pGL3 - Cofilin 1 promoter , pGL3 - mutCofilin 1 vector and siTCF7L2 , or NC vector . After 48 h of co - transfection , luciferase activity was detected using the Dual - Glo luciferase assay kit ( Promega , USA ) . Xenograft assay All experimental procedures involving animals were performed according to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals ( 8th edition ) [ 31 ] . T24 and RT4 cells were pre - treated with Cofilin 1 , si - Cofilin 1 , and NC , respectively , for 24 h . The cells were then suspended in 100 μL PBS at 4×10 6 cells / mL and injected into right flanks of 5 - 6 week - old BALB / C female athymic nude mice ( n = 6 per group ) . Tumor sizes were monitored by measuring the length ( L ) and width ( W ) with calipers , and volumes were calculated using the formula ( L×W 2 ) / 2 .
