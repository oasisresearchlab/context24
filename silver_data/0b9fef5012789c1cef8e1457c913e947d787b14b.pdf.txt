These mRNAs associate with Myo4p via the She2p and She3p proteins . She3p is an adaptor protein that links Myo4p to its cargo . She2p binds to ASH1 and IST2 mRNA , while She3p binds to both She2p and Myo4p . Here we show that Myo4p and She3p , but not She2p , are required for the inheritance of cortical ER in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Consistent with this observation , M we ﬁnd that cortical ER inheritance is independent of mRNA transport . Cortical ER is a dynamic network that forms cytoplasmic tubular connections to the nuclear envelope . ER tubules failed to grow when actin polymerization was blocked with the drug latrunculin A ( Lat - A ) . Additionally , a reduction in the number of cytoplasmic ER tubules was observed in Lat - A – treated and myo4 (cid:2) cells . Our results suggest that Myo4p and She3p facilitate the growth and orientation of ER tubules . Introduction During cell division , organelles are duplicated or fragmented and then partitioned into daughter cells . The accurate segre - gation of organelles from mother to daughter cells during the cell cycle can occur either randomly or by an ordered process that requires cellular machinery . A growing body of data suggests that the latter is the more common mechanism ( Warren and Wickner , 1996 ; Yaffe , 1999 ; Catlett and Weisman , 2000 ) . Although the inheritance of some organelles , such as the mammalian Golgi , the yeast vacuole , and mito - chondria , has been investigated in some detail , less is known about the inheritance of the ER . In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae the ER has been divided into two classes : perinuclear ER and cortical or peripheral ER ( Rose et al . , 1989 ; Preuss et al . , 1991 ) . The perinuclear ER surrounds the nucleus , while the cortical ER forms a highly dynamic network of interconnected tubules that line the cell periphery . Like peripheral ER in mammalian cells , cortical ER undergoes ring closure and tubule branching movements ( Prinz et al . , 2000 ) . During cell division , the first ER elements observed in the growing bud are cytoplasmic ER tubules oriented along the mother – bud axis ( Du et al . , 2001 ) . These tubules either associate with the prebud site and are passively pulled into the growing bud ( Fehrenbacher et al . , 2002 ) or migrate into the daughter cell very soon after bud emergence ( Du et al . , 2001 ) . The appearance of tubules aligned along the mother – bud axis suggests that a polarized structure is used for their orientation . The actin cytoskeleton is a likely candidate for this structure , as actin filaments are required for the inheritance of other organelles and for ER dynamics and motility ( Catlett et al . , 2000 ; Prinz et al . , 2000 ; Fehrenbacher et al . , 2002 ; Wöllert et al . , 2002 ) . Type V myosins are actin - associated motors required for the polarized distribution of organelles , proteins , and mRNAs . These highly conserved myosins contain a number of structural elements that include an NH 2 - terminal motor domain that binds to actin filaments and a COOH - terminal tail domain that binds cargo ( Cheney et al . , 1993 ; Tabb et al . , 1998 ) . In the squid giant axon , ER vesicles are transported on actin filaments by myosin V ( Tabb et al . , 1998 ) . Loss of myosin Va , encoded by the mouse dilute locus , leads to neurological disorders that may result from defects in the transport of smooth ER from the dendritic shaft to the dendritic spine . The lightened coat color of dilute mice reflects a defect in melanosome transport ( Wu et al . , 1997 ) . In plants , the actin network has been implicated in the maintenance of ER organization ( Foissner et al . , 1996 ; Boevink et al . , 1998 ) , P . Estrada and J .

In S . cerevisiae , there are two type V myosins , Myo2p and Myo4p . Myo4p is a nonessential myosin required for the asymmetric distribution of ASH1 and IST2 mRNAs ( Long et al . , 1997 ; Takizawa et al . , 2000 ) . ASH1 mRNA binds to She2p , and the resulting RNA protein complex then binds to the adaptor protein She3p . She3p associates with Myo4p , and the fully assembled complex moves along actin cables to the bud tip ( Bertrand et al . , 1998 ; Böhl et al . , 2000 ; Long et al . , 2000 ) . Ash1p then acts to inhibit mating type switching in daughter cells by repressing HO endonuclease expression ( Bobola et al . , 1996 ; Sil and Herskowitz , 1996 ) . A similar mechanism of transport involving the She proteins is thought to regulate the asymmetric distribution of IST2 mRNA ( Tak - izawa and Vale , 2000 ) . Myo2p orients the mitotic spindle dur - ing the cell cycle ( Yin et al . , 2000 ) . It is also required for polar - ized secretion ( Govindan et al . , 1995 ; Pruyne et al . , 1998 ) , and it is essential for the delivery of late Golgi elements ( Ros - sanese et al . , 2001 ) , the vacuole ( Catlett and Weisman , 1998 ) , and mitochondria ( Itoh et al . , 2002 ) into daughter cells . Al - though it is clear that the transport of these organelles into daughter cells is dependent on an actin track ( Simon et al . , 1997 ; Hill et al . , 1996 ; Rossanese et al . , 2001 ) and a Myo2p motor , the role of actin and myosin motors in the inheritance of ER has been elusive . Here we show that actin , Myo4p , and She3p are required for the inheritance of cortical ER . Results Myo4p is required for the inheritance of cortical ER from mother to daughter cells To identify new genes whose products play a role in the in - heritance of cortical ER , we initiated a screen of the yeast deletion library . The Hmg1p - GFP fusion protein ( NH 2 - terminal transmembrane domain of HMG - CoA reductase isozyme 1 fused to GFP ) , used as an ER marker in our stud - ies , was described and characterized in an earlier report ( Du et al . , 2001 ) . The gene encoding this fusion protein was cloned into a CEN ( LEU2 ) plasmid and then transformed Figure 1 . Myo4p is required for the delivery of cortical ER to the periphery of daughter cells . Wild - type and mutant cells expressing the ER markers Hmg1p - GFP ( A , B , and C ) or YFP - HDEL ( D and E ) were grown at 30 (cid:3) C in SC media with the appropriate amino acids . Arrows point to small buds ( 0 . 3 – 0 . 5 diameter of mother cell ) in wild - type ( A and D ) and myo4 mutant cells ( B , C , and E ) . The myo4 - 1 mutant contains a point mutation in the ATP - binding region of the motor domain ( G171E ) . Cells were analyzed using fluorescence microscopy . Table I .

After screening 768 deletion mutants , a strain con - taining a deletion of YAL029C was found to be defective in cortical ER inheritance . PCR analysis confirmed that this strain lacked the myo4 gene . The remainder of this report fo - cuses on the phenotypic characterization of cells that lack myo4 and the role of Myo4p in ER inheritance . To verify that the ER inheritance defect was due to the loss of myo4 and to confirm the phenotype in our strain back - ground , we disrupted the myo4 gene in a wild - type strain ( SFNY1054 ) . In myo4 (cid:2) cells , a dramatic defect in the deliv - ery of cortical ER tubules from mother to daughter cells was observed ( Fig . 1 , compare B with A ) . Approximately 73 % of the myo4 (cid:2) small - budded cells ( bud diameter between 0 . 3 and 0 . 5 of the mother ) displayed a defect in cortical ER in - heritance , while 99 % of the wild - type small - budded cells ac - quired cortical ER ( Table I ) . A similar percentage ( 76 % ) of mutant cells at an intermediate stage of bud growth ( bud di - ameter (cid:4) 0 . 5 of the mother , but before nuclear segregation ) also failed to contain cortical ER , while 88 % of wild - type buds of the same size contained ER tubules that were uni - formly distributed to the cell periphery . In cells at a late stage of bud growth ( after nuclear segregation but before nuclear division ) , 73 % of the myo4 (cid:2) cells displayed a defect in corti - cal ER inheritance ( Table I ) . Thus , at all stages of the cell cy - cle leading up to nuclear division , there was a dramatic re - duction in the delivery of cortical ER into the bud . To determine if the motor activity of Myo4p plays a role in cortical ER inheritance , we constructed a point mutation in the ATP - binding region of the motor domain of Myo4p ( myo4 - 1 ) that converted the glycine at amino acid 171 to a glutamate . As shown in Fig . 1 C , the myo4 - 1 mutant displayed a defect in ER inheritance . This finding implies that the motor activity of Myo4p is required to deliver ER into daughter cells . To confirm that the apparent defect in transport of cortical ER into daughter cells was not specific to Hmg1p - GFP , the localization of a second ER marker was examined . For these studies , a construct containing an NH 2 - terminal signal se - quence and a COOH - terminal ER retrieval HDEL signal , fused to YFP , was transformed into the myo4 (cid:2) mutant . In wild type , the localization pattern of YFP - HDEL was similar to that of Hmg1p - GFP ( Fig . 1 , compare D with A ) . Quanti - tation of the YFP - HDEL localization pattern revealed that (cid:4) 95 % of buds in the different stages of growth contained cortical ER ( Table I ) . In the myo4 (cid:2) mutant expressing YFP - HDEL , most of the buds exhibited defects in cortical ER in - Figure 2 . The organelle inheritance defect in myo4 (cid:2) appears to be specific for the ER . Organelle distribution in small buds with a volume 4 – 13 % of the mother was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy in wild - type and myo4 (cid:2) mutants expressing the ER marker Hmg1p - GFP ( A – C , left ) . The vacuole was visualized using the lipophilic dye FM 4 - 64 ( A , middle ) . The mitochondria were observed in cells transformed with a plasmid expressing the F 0 ATP synthase mitochondrial targeting sequence fused to RFP ( Mozdy et al . , 2000 ) ( B , middle ) . Using the marker Och1p - HA , the early Golgi complex was observed by indirect immunofluorescence with a monoclonal antibody directed against the HA epitope ( C , middle ) . The late Golgi complex was examined in SFNY1240 and SFNY1280 cells expressing Sec7p - GFP ( D , left ) .

Approximately 75 % of the small buds , 67 % of the intermediate buds ( before nuclear segregation ) , and 66 % of the large buds ( after nuclear segregation , but before nuclear division ) failed to acquire cortical ER ( Fig . 1 E and Table I ) . This was similar to the data obtained using Hmg1p - GFP as an ER marker protein ( Table I , compare row 4 with row 2 ) . Thus , using two different ER marker proteins , we have con - firmed that cells lacking Myo4p motor activity display a dra - matic , but still incomplete , defect in cortical ER inheritance . The inheritance of other organelles is unaffected in a myo4 (cid:2) mutant To determine if Myo4p is specifically required for the inherit - ance of cortical ER , we examined the inheritance of other or - ganelles in the myo4 (cid:2) mutant . Vacuolar inheritance was ex - amined in wild - type and myo4 (cid:2) cells expressing Hmg1p - GFP using the lipophilic vital dye FM4 - 64 , which stains the vacu - olar membrane ( Vida and Emr , 1995 ) . In the myo4 (cid:2) mutant , 137 buds that contained little to no cortical ER were exam - ined for vacuolar inheritance . A similar number ( 123 ) of wild - type buds were also analyzed . In both wild - type and myo4 (cid:2) cells , all buds inherited a labeled parental vacuole ( Fig . 2 A ) . Thus , the inheritance of vacuoles is independent of Myo4p . The inheritance of mitochondria and Golgi elements was also examined in cells that lack Myo4p . Mitochondrial in - heritance was studied by expressing a plasmid ( pSFNB784 ) , containing a mitochondrial targeting sequence fused to RFP ( Mozdy et al . , 2000 ) , in wild - type and myo4 (cid:2) cells that con - tain Hmg1p - GFP . In myo4 (cid:2) cells , mitochondrial tubules were transported into buds that failed to inherit cortical ER ( Fig . 2 B ) . Mitochondrial tubules were observed in 92 of the 93 myo4 (cid:2) buds and in 97 of the 97 wild - type buds exam - ined . Thus , the distribution of mitochondria in wild - type and myo4 (cid:2) buds was essentially indistinguishable . Sec7p is a peripheral membrane protein that is specifically localized to late Golgi membranes ( Franzusoff et al . , 1991 ; Rossanese et al . , 2001 ) . To examine the inheritance of late Golgi , the SEC7 gene was replaced with a SEC7 - GFP fusion in wild - type and myo4 (cid:2) mutant cells . The distribution of Sec7p - GFP was found to be comparable in wild type and the myo4 (cid:2) mutant ( Fig . 2 D ) . In the myo4 (cid:2) cells , all mutant buds ( 122 ) contained late Golgi elements . The same result was observed in the 97 wild - type cells examined . Furthermore , mutant and wild - type buds contained approximately the same number of Sec7p - containing structures . These results are consistent with prior studies showing that the polarized transport of vacuoles , mitochondria , and the late Golgi requires the Myo2p motor ( Hill et al . , 1996 ; Rossanese et al . , 2001 ; Itoh et al . , 2002 ) . While the inheritance of the late Golgi is thought to be an actin - dependent process that requires Myo2p ( Rossanese et al . , 2001 ) , less is known about the inheritance of early Golgi elements . It has been proposed that the early Golgi is de - Figure 3 . ER tubules arising from the perinuclear ER of cells treated with Lat - A fail to enter the emerging bud . Diploid wild - type cells ( SFNY1061 ) expressing the ER marker Hmg1 - GFP were grown overnight in YPD media at 30 (cid:3) C , treated with 200 (cid:5) M Lat - A , and viewed within 10 min of treatment . The movement of tubules toward the emerging bud in the absence ( A ) or presence ( B ) of Lat - A was determined by time - lapse fluorescence microscopy at 0 . 3 - min intervals during a 3 . 0 - min time period . Arrows point to an ER tubule aligned along the mother – bud axis . on J u l y 11 , 2017 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m ER inheritance | Estrada et al . 1259 rived from the ER ( Rossanese et al . , 1999 ; Bevis et al . , 2002 ) . Like the cortical ER , early Golgi membranes enter daughter cells at an early stage of bud growth ( Preuss et al . , 1992 ; Du et al . , 2001 ; Rossanese et al . , 2001 ) . The inherit - ance of early Golgi membranes was examined by comparing the distribution of Och1p in myo4 (cid:2) and wild - type cells . Och1p is a carbohydrate - modifying enzyme that defines one of the earliest Golgi compartments in yeast ( Nakayama et al . , 1992 ) . A plasmid expressing HA - tagged Och1p was transformed into wild - type and myo4 (cid:2) mutant cells , and the distribution of early Golgi elements was followed by indirect fluorescence using an anti - HA monoclonal antibody . The localization of early Golgi membranes in 107 myo4 (cid:2) mutant cells that displayed a defect in ER inheritance was indistin - guishable from that of the 103 wild - type cells examined ( Fig . 2 C ) . Thus , Myo4p is specifically required for the in - heritance of cortical ER and not the inheritance of the vacu - ole , mitochondria , and early or late Golgi . These findings imply that the two type V myosins in yeast , Myo4p and Myo2p , have distinct and nonoverlapping functions in or - ganelle inheritance . Growth of ER tubules into the bud Cytoplasmic ER tubules are readily observed in wild - type cells expressing Hmg1p - GFP . These tubules emanate from the perinuclear region , and some extend toward the bud ( Fig . 3 A and Fig . 4 A ) . Time - lapse imaging revealed that a subset of these tubules appear to grow into the bud , suggest - ing that they give rise to cortical ER in the daughter cell . We found that tubule growth required polymerized actin , as cells treated with the actin - depolymerizing drug latrunculin A ( Lat - A ) failed to extend tubules into the bud ( Fig . 3 B ) . We estimated , from 10 movies of ER tubule tip movement ( see Videos 1 – 10 , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200304030 / DC1 ) , that the average length of move - ment is 1 . 6 (cid:5) m . The average rate is 0 . 013 (cid:5) m / s with a stan - dard deviation of 0 . 0015 (cid:5) m / s . The tight clustering of the rates , as well as the vectorial nature of the extension , is consis - tent with a motor driven process . The rate of ER tubule tip movement is , however , substantially slower than the maximal rate observed for the Myo4p - driven movement of actin fibers in vitro ( Reck - Peterson et al . , 2001 ) . These findings suggest that Myo4p may play a role in forming and extending ER tu - bules , and that the velocity of tubule extension is limited by tubule growth and not the motor activity of Myo4p . Interest - ingly , the rate of tubule extension that we have observed is similar to the elongation rate of ER tubules in animal cells ( Waterman - Storer and Salmon , 1998 ) . Because tubules are seen within the bud soon after bud emergence and are ini - tially quite faint , we could not exclude the possibility that tu - bules below our limit of detection associate with the prebud site and are passively pulled into the bud as it grows , as sug - gested by prior studies ( Fehrenbacher et al . , 2002 ) . The number of cytoplasmic tubules are reduced in Lat - A – treated and myo4 (cid:2) cells To determine if actin and Myo4p play a role in the formation or stability of cytoplasmic ER tubules , we examined cells ex - pressing Hmg1p - GFP and quantified the number of ER tu - bules . We found that (cid:2) 90 % of wild - type cells contained at least one ER tubule , with 30 – 40 % containing more than one tubule ( Fig . 4 B ) . The number of tubules formed was similar in small - and large - budded cells . In contrast , treatment with Lat - A reduced the percentage of cells with at least one tubule Figure 4 . The number of ER tubules arising from the perinuclear ER is decreased in Lat - A – treated and myo4 (cid:2) cells . Diploid wild - type cells expressing the ER marker Hmg1 - GFP were grown in YPD media at 30 (cid:3) C . The number of tubules emerging from the perinuclear ER in small - budded cells was determined by fluorescence microscopy . ( A ) Wild - type diploid cells display ER tubules emerging from the perinuclear ER , while diploid cells treated with 200 (cid:5) M Lat - A ( as described in the Materials and methods ) have a reduced number of tubules arising from the perinuclear ER .

For B , a total of 206 small - budded and 188 large - budded untreated cells were examined . A total of 186 small - budded and 121 large - budded Lat - A – treated cells were studied . In C , 158 small - budded and 177 large - budded myo4 (cid:2) cells were examined .

In myo4 (cid:2) cells , the percentage of cells with at least one tubule was (cid:2) 40 % in both small - and large - budded cells ( Fig . 4 C ) . Furthermore , the percentage of myo4 (cid:2) cells with more than one tubule was (cid:6) 10 % . An even more dramatic result was seen when we re - stricted our analysis to those tubules oriented along the mother – bud axis in small - budded cells . While 90 % of small - budded wild - type cells contained a cytoplasmic tubule ori - ented along the mother – bud axis , only 9 % of small - budded myo4 (cid:2) cells contained such a structure ( for examples see Vid - eos 11 – 20 , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200304030 / DC1 ) . Thus , the formation , as well as orien - tation , of cytoplasmic ER tubules is dependent on actin and Myo4p . These findings are consistent with previous studies that implicated the actin cytoskeleton in the maintenance of ER dynamics ( Prinz et al . , 2000 ; Fehrenbacher et al . , 2002 ) . She3p , but not She2p , is required for the inheritance of cortical ER The binding of Myo4p to ASH1 mRNA requires both She2p and She3p ( Böhl et al . , 2000 ; Takizawa et al . , 2000 ) . To determine if She2p and She3p play a role in the inherit - ance of cortical ER , we examined the delivery of Hmg1p - GFP into daughter cells in she2 (cid:2) and she3 (cid:2) strains and compared their phenotype to wild type and the myo4 (cid:2) mu - tant ( Fig . 5 , A and B ) . A dramatic delay in the delivery of cortical ER from mother to daughter cells was observed in she3 (cid:2) ( Fig . 5 D ) , but not she2 (cid:2) ( Fig . 5 C and Table II ) , mu - tant cells . In small buds with a diameter between 0 . 3 and 0 . 5 of the mother cell , (cid:2) 88 % of the she3 (cid:2) daughter cells dis - played a defect in cortical ER inheritance ( Table II ) . In wild - type buds of the same size , (cid:2) 94 % of the cells acquired corti - cal ER . In large - budded she3 (cid:2) cells , without nuclei , (cid:2) 72 % of the buds were defective for cortical ER inheritance . In larger buds in which the nucleus had not yet divided , a sig - nificant portion of the she3 (cid:2) buds ( (cid:2) 38 % ) also showed a defect in ER inheritance ( Table II ) .

These findings in - dicate that She3p , but not She2p , is required for the inherit - ance of cortical ER . The defect in ER inheritance observed in the myo4 (cid:2) and she3 (cid:2) mutants is not a secondary conse - quence of disrupting the actin network , as the loss of Myo4p and She3p does not alter actin assembly ( unpublished data ) . Myo4p and She3p cofractionate with the ER One prediction of the finding that Myo4p and She3p are re - quired for ER inheritance is that both of these proteins should associate with the ER . Subcellular fractionation was performed to localize Myo4p and its adaptor protein She3p on a sucrose gradient that resolves the ER from other intracellular mem - branes ( Antebi and Fink , 1992 ; Barrowman et al . , 2000 ) . Strains expressing either She3p - myc ( SFNY1264 ) or Myo4p - myc ( SFNY1221 ) were used to detect She3p and Myo4p . The presence of a 13myc tag on either protein did not affect ER in - heritance or ASHI RNA localization ( unpublished data ; Tak - izawa and Vale , 2000 ) . Lysates were prepared from SFNY1264 and SFNY1221 , and the distribution of She3p and Myo4p , relative to the ER marker proteins Sec61p and Dpm1p ( Wilkinson et al . , 1996 ; Preuss et al . , 1991 ) , was determined by Western blot analysis . In several gradients , a substantial amount of the She3p ( 26 – 46 % ) cofractionated with the ER ( Fig . 6 A ) , while a smaller portion ( (cid:2) 5 – 10 % ) of the Myo4p was found in ER fractions ( Fig . 6 B ) . The amount of She3p and Myo4p associated with the ER may vary , as peripheral membrane proteins tend to shear off membranes during lysis . The localization of She3p and Myo4p was unchanged when ly - sates prepared from she2 (cid:2) strains expressing either She3p - myc or Myo4p - myc were fractionated ( Fig . 7 , A and B ) . The same results were also obtained when lysates expressing She3p - myc ( Fig . 7 C ) or Myo4p - myc ( not depicted ) were treated with RNase . Thus , the interaction of the Myo4p – She3p motor complex with the ER is not mediated by an associated RNA . As the ER cofractionates with the plasma membrane on this gradient , we stripped the ER of ribosomes by fractionat - ing extracts on a sucrose density gradient in the presence of EDTA , as described before ( Roberg et al . , 1997 ) . As shown in Fig . 6 C , the ER fractionated at the top of the gradient and was well resolved from the more dense plasma membrane . Furthermore , She3p cofractionated with the ER and not the plasma membrane . The same result was obtained when Myo4p was localized on this gradient ( Fig . 6 C ) . As the adap - tor protein She3p and the class V myosin Myo4p form a complex ( Takizawa and Vale , 2000 ) and both proteins cofrac - tionate with the ER , these findings imply that the Myo4p – She3p motor complex is directly associated with the ER . Figure 6 . She3p and Myo4p colocalize with the ER . She3p ( SFNY1264 ) and Myo4p ( SFNY1221 ) were tagged with the 13x - myc epitope at the COOH terminus in cells expressing the ER marker Hmg1p - GFP . Cells were grown in minimal media with the appropriate amino acids to early log phase at 30 (cid:3) C . She3 - 13x - myc ( A , bottom , (cid:2) ) and Myo4 – 13x - myc ( B , bottom , (cid:2) ) cofractionate on a sucrose velocity gradient with the ER markers Dpm1p ( A and B , top , (cid:3) ) and Sec61p ( A and B , top , (cid:4) ) . Myc - tagged She3p ( C , (cid:2) ) and Myc - tagged Myo4p ( C , (cid:2) ) colocalize with Sec61p ( C , (cid:4) ) but not with the plasma membrane marker Pma1p ( C , (cid:3) ) on an EDTA sucrose density gradient . on J u l y 11 , 2017 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m 1262 The Journal of Cell Biology | Volume 163 , Number 6 , 2003 Cortical ER inheritance is not required for the asymmetric distribution of mRNA The finding that the Myo4p – She3p complex is required for ER inheritance raises the possibility that the asymmetric dis - tribution of mRNA is dependent on cortical ER inheritance . To address this question , the localization of IST2 mRNA ( Takizawa et al . , 2000 ) , which localizes to the bud tip throughout the cell cycle , was examined in the aux1 mutant , which is defective in ER inheritance ( Du et al . , 2001 ) . AUX1 encodes a hydrophilic protein of 668 amino acids . The COOH terminus of Aux1p contains a J - domain that is homologous to the J - domain of the clathrin uncoating pro - tein auxilin ( Holstein et al . , 1996 ) . Aux1p may be a bifunc - tional protein , as the loss of the J - domain leads to vacuole fragmentation and membrane accumulation but does not af - fect the segregation of ER into daughter cells ( Du et al . , 2001 ) . We found that IST2 mRNA localized to the bud tip in wild - type cells and in an aux1 (cid:2) mutant , lacking the entire AUX1 gene ( Fig . 8 A ) . Similar results were obtained when the localization of ASH1 mRNA was examined ( not de - picted ) . Thus , cortical ER inheritance is not required for the localization of mRNA to the bud tip . To determine if cortical ER inheritance and mRNA transport are independent processes , we constructed a mu - tant in she3 that disrupts the She2p binding site . Previous studies ( Böhl et al . , 2000 ) have shown that She3p binds to She2p via the COOH terminus of She3p ( amino acids 213 – 426 ) . To disrupt the interaction of She3p with She2p , we deleted the last 176 amino acids of She3p ( see diagram in Fig . 8 B ) . As anticipated , IST2 mRNA failed to localize to the bud tip in this mutant ( Fig . 8 C ) . In contrast , trunca - tion of the COOH terminus of She3p had no effect on ER inheritance ( Fig . 8 C ) . These findings demonstrate that dif - ferent domains of She3p are required for mRNA localiza - tion and ER inheritance . Discussion There are two type V myosins in yeast , Myo2p and Myo4p . Myo2p binds to a variety of cargo . It has been implicated in the polarized delivery of secretory vesicles ( Govindan et al . , 1995 ; Pruyne et al . , 1998 ) and in the inheritance of several organelles ( Catlett and Weisman , 1998 ; Rossanese et al . , 2001 ; Itoh et al . , 2002 ) . Myo2p also plays a role in orienting the spindle during the cell cycle ( Yin et al . , 2000 ) . However , until this study , the only known role for Myo4p was in the localization of ASH1 and IST2 mRNAs to the bud tip . Proper localization of ASH1 and IST2 mRNA requires the SHE genes ( Bobola et al . , 1996 ; Jansen et al . , 1996 ; Tak - izawa et al . , 2000 ) . ASH1 and IST2 bind to She2p , while She3p links Myo4p to the She2p – mRNA complex ( Böhl et al . , 2000 ; Takizawa and Vale , 2000 ) . Movement of the She2p – mRNA ribonucleoprotein complex along actin ca - bles is myosin dependent , and the deletion of myo4 , she2 , or she3 prevents these mRNAs from localizing to the bud tip ( Jansen et al . , 1996 ; Long et al . , 1997 ) . Cortical ER enters daughter cells in a polarized fashion . It is enriched at the presumptive bud site and accumulates at the Figure 7 . She3p and Myo4p colocalize with the ER in the absence of She2p . She3p ( SFNY1265 ) and Myo4p ( SFNY1266 ) were tagged with the 13x - myc epitope at the COOH terminus in she2 (cid:2) cells expressing the ER marker Hmg1p - GFP . Cells were grown at 30 (cid:3) C in minimal media with the appropriate amino acids to early log phase . ( A ) She3p - 13x - myc ( bottom , (cid:2) ) and ( B ) Myo4 – 13x - myc ( bottom , (cid:2) ) cofractionate on a sucrose velocity gradient with the ER markers Dpm1p ( A and B , top , (cid:3) ) and Sec61p ( A and B , top , (cid:4) ) . ( C ) A lysate prepared from myc - tagged She3p ( SFNY 1264 ) was treated with RNase A for 5 min and then fractionated on a sucrose velocity gradient . Myc - tagged She3p ( C , bottom , (cid:2) ) colocalizes with the ER markers Sec61p ( C , top , (cid:4) ) and Dpm1p ( C , top , (cid:3) ) . on J u l y 11 , 2017 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m ER inheritance | Estrada et al . 1263 bud tip in small - and medium - sized buds ( Fehrenbacher et al . , 2002 ) . Myo4p , which is required for this process , localizes to the cortex and bud tip ( Jansen et al . , 1996 ; Münchow et al . , 1999 ) and is enriched in the bud by a retention mechanism that involves the RNA binding protein She2p ( Kruse et al . , 2002 ) . Here we have identified a role for Myo4p in cortical ER inheritance . We show that the role of Myo4p in organelle inheritance is distinct from that of Myo2p . While Myo4p is required for ER inheritance , it is not required for the inherit - ance of vacuoles , mitochondria , and late Golgi elements , events known to be dependent on Myo2p ( Hill et al . , 1996 ; Rossanese et al . , 2001 ; Itoh et al . , 2002 ) . Our findings indi - cate that the deletion of myo4 and she3 , but not she2 , results in a partial block in the delivery of cortical ER from mother to daughter cells . Furthermore , deletion of myo4 or inhibition of actin polymerization with the drug Lat - A leads to a significant reduction in the number of ER tubules in the cytoplasm . Tu - bules oriented along the mother – bud axis in small - budded cells are most dramatically affected . Cytoplasmic ER tubules also fail to enter daughter cells subsequent to Lat - A treatment . Myo4p and She3p may be needed for the growth and orienta - tion of cytoplasmic ER tubules into daughter cells . Although the deletion of either myo4 or she3 leads to a dra - matic loss of cortical ER in daughter cells , (cid:2) 25 % of the buds still receive ER elements . Treatment of myo4 (cid:2) cells with no - codazole did not decrease the amount of cortical ER found in the bud ( unpublished data ) , indicating that the ER that en - ters the bud in myo4 (cid:2) cells is not microtubule dependent . These findings indicate that a Myo4p / She3p - independent mechanism can function to transmit ER into daughter cells , albeit inefficiently . Additional studies will be needed to de - fine the nature of this secondary pathway to ER inheritance . In neurons , the ER is transported on actin by myosin V ( Tabb et al . , 1998 ) , and myosin V drives ER network forma - tion in Xenopus egg extracts ( Wöllert et al . , 2002 ) . Thus the growth , formation , and movement of ER by myosin V along actin is a highly conserved process . Our finding that both Myo4p and She3p physically associate with ER membranes implies that both of these proteins play a direct role in the in - heritance of ER . Interestingly , a larger fraction of the She3p cofractionated with the ER . This suggests that She3p may link Myo4p to ER tubules . The finding that she3 (cid:2) cells dis - play a defect in ER inheritance is consistent with this pro - posal . Although the interaction between Myo4p and ASH1 mRNA is dependent on She2p ( Münchow et al . , 1999 ) , the association of She3p and Myo4p with ER membranes is not . Consistent with this result , we find that the loss of She2p does not lead to a defect in cortical ER inheritance , and that Figure 8 . Inheritance of cortical ER does not require the asymmetric distribution of mRNA . ( A ) Localization of IST2 mRNA . IST2 mRNA distribution was determined in wild - type and aux1 (cid:2) small - budded cells by in situ hybridization ( Takizawa et al . , 2000 ) . IST2 mRNA was observed at the bud tip in both wild type and the mutant . Note that aux1 mutant cells are slightly larger than wild type . ( B ) Schematic of She3p constructs used to study cortical ER inheritance . The top construct represents full - length She3p expressed in SFNY1303 , and the bottom construct depicts a She3p truncation lacking 176 amino acids from its COOH terminus expressed in SFNY1310 . The numbers correspond to the amino acid position . ( C ) Inheritance of cortical ER does not require the She2p - binding domain of She3p . SFNY1303 ( wild type ) and SFNY 1310 ( she3 (cid:2) c ) cells expressing the ER marker Hmg1p - GFP were grown at 30 (cid:3) C in SC media with the appropriate amino acids . Arrows point to the cortical ER at the periphery of small buds . IST2 mRNA is mislocalized in she3 (cid:2) c cells . mRNA distribution was analyzed as described in A . on J u l y 11 , 2017 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m 1264 The Journal of Cell Biology | Volume 163 , Number 6 , 2003 cortical ER inheritance is independent of mRNA localiza - tion . Thus , the Myo4p – She3p complex must bind to the ER via a factor other than She2p . We are currently screening the yeast deletion library to identify this unknown factor as well as additional components of the ER inheritance machinery . Materials and methods Plasmids and strains Plasmid SFNB1030 ( CEN URA3 ) encodes the HDEL signal sequence from KAR2 fused to the COOH terminus of YFP . To generate this plasmid , a 0 . 864 - kb fragment that encodes HDEL - YFP was amplified from pDN300 ( a gift from David Ng , Pennsylvania State University , University Park , PA ) with primers to introduce SalI and SpeI restriction sites . This PCR product was then cloned into pTEF416 ( CEN URA3 ) between the SalI and SpeI sites . SFNY1196 and SFNY1270 ( Table III ) were constructed by transforming NY1211 and SFNY1235 , respectively , with plasmid SFNB1030 ( Table III ) and selecting for Leu (cid:7) transformants . Strains SFNY1224 and SFNY1225 ( Ta - ble III ) were constructed by transforming SFNY1235 with plasmids SFNB784 and SFNB637 ( Table III ) , respectively , and selecting for Leu (cid:7) transformants . SFNY1261 , SFNY1262 , SFNY1263 , and SFNY1267 ( Table III ) were con - structed by transforming BY4741 , YKL130C , YAL029C , and YBR130C from the ResGen deletion library , respectively , with plasmid SFNB1000 and se - lecting for Leu (cid:7) transformants . All deletions were confirmed by PCR analysis . Full - length SHE3 , in vector pRS316 , was introduced into SFNY1267 to generate SFNY1303 ( Table III ) . A she3 truncation mutant ( lacking 176 amino acids from the COOH terminus ) , in vector pRS316 , was introduced into SFNY1267 to generate SFNY1310 ( Table III ) , and Ura (cid:7) transformants were selected . Plasmid PT201 ( CEN LEU2 ) , carrying a point mutation in the ATP - binding region of the motor domain of Myo4p ( G171E ) , was trans - formed into SFNY1218 ( Table III ) to generate SFNY1220 . The myo4 - 1 mu - tant allele was obtained from Susan Brown when she was at the University of Michigan ( Ann Arbor , MI ) . To construct SFNY1305 ( Table III ) , YIplac204 / DsRed . T1 - HDEL ( a gift from Ben Glick , University of Chicago , Chicago , IL ) was linearized with EcoRV and transformed into PT68 , and Trp (cid:7) transformants were selected . Isolation of the myo4 mutant The yeast MATa haploid deletion library from Research Genetics ( ResGen - Invitrogen Corporation ) was screened to identify genes that display a de - fect in the inheritance of cortical ER . The library contains 4 , 848 ORFs that were disrupted with the KanMX module in the parent strain BY4741 . Cells were transformed with plasmid SFNB1000 ( CEN , LEU ) using a Hydra 96 microdispenser ( Robbins Scientific Corporation ) . Stationery cultures were generated in a 96 - well assay block ( Corning Inc . ) by inoculating YPD ( 580 (cid:5) l per well ) with cells ( 10 (cid:5) l ) from a ResGen master plate . Glass beads ( 3 . 5 mm ; Fisher Scientific ) were placed in each well to facilitate airation of the cultures . The block was incubated for 3 d at 25 (cid:3) C . Stationery cultures were diluted ( 1 : 1 , 000 ) in YPD and grown overnight at 25 (cid:3) C to an OD 600 of 1 . 0 – 1 . 5 . The cells were transferred ( 390 (cid:5) l per well ) to a new assay block without beads and centrifuged at 2 , 000 rpm for 5 min . Pellets were washed with sterile water ( 580 (cid:5) l per well ) , centrifuged , resus - pended in LTE ( 100 mM LiOAc , 10 mM Tris pH to 8 . 0 , 1 mM EDTA ; 580 (cid:5) l per well ) , and then incubated at room temperature for 1 h . The robot was sterilized after each step in the transformation protocol by washing the teflon needles and glass wells three times in 70 % ethanol followed by three washes in sterile water . The cells were then centrifuged and the pellets were resuspended in 35 % PEG / LTE ( 405 (cid:5) l per well ) . Transformation was per - formed by adding 15 (cid:5) l of a 2 mg / ml stock of carrier DNA ( salmon testes from Sigma - Aldrich ) and 15 (cid:5) l of DNA ( 50 ng / (cid:5) l stock ) from plasmid SFNB1000 ( HMG1 - GFP CEN LEU2 ) into each well followed by a 1 - h incu - bation at 30 (cid:3) C . The cells were heat shocked for 10 min in a 42 (cid:3) C water bath and centrifuged . The pellets were washed in sterile water ( 580 (cid:5) l per well ) , centrifuged , resuspended in synthetic complete ( SC ) minus Leu media ( 580 Table III .

Trans - formed cells were grown for 3 d at 25 (cid:3) C and then replica plated onto a syn - thetic dropout minus Leu ( QBiogen ) agar plate and grown for 3 d to confirm transformation . Stationary cultures were grown from colonies on the agar plate as described above . The stationery cultures were then diluted and grown overnight at 25 (cid:3) C in SC minus Leu to an OD 600 of (cid:2) 0 . 3 – 0 . 5 . A total of 768 deletion strains out of the 4 , 848 in the library ( 16 % ) were screened . Strain construction SFNY1218 and SFNY1235 were generated using a PCR - based gene dele - tion method ( Longtine et al . , 1998 ) . The forward primer , MYO4 - F1 ( 5 (cid:9) - AACACAAAAAAACAAAAAAAATCCTATAACCAGTTCTCCCGCGGTCGA - CGGATCCCCGGGTT - 3 (cid:9) ) contained 40 nucleotides of MYO4 gene - spe - cific sequence located upstream of the start codon followed by 20 nucle - otides of gene - specific sequence from plasmid pFA6a - His3MX6 , which contains the his5 (cid:7) gene from Schizosaccharomyces pombe ( Longtine et al . , 1998 ) . The reverse primer , MYO4 - R1 ( 5 (cid:9) - TATATACATATATACATAT - ATGGGCGTATATTTACTTTGTTCGAATTCGAGCTCGTTTAAAC - 3 (cid:9) ) con - tained 40 nucleotides of MYO4 gene - specific sequence located down - stream of the stop codon followed by 20 nucleotides of gene - specific sequence from plasmid pFA6a - His3MX6 . The fragment was amplified , and the PCR product was transformed into SFNY1054 and NY1211 ( Table III ) . His (cid:7) transformants were selected , and replacement of the MYO4 gene with his5 (cid:7) was confirmed by PCR . SFNY1226 and SFNY1227 ( Table III ) were generated by the same method with the following primers . To disrupt SHE2 , SHE2 - F1 ( 5 (cid:9) - CCCTCCTTAATTTTCCTTTTGCATAATACCAGACAC - TTAAAAGGTCGACGGATCCCCGGGTT - 3 (cid:9) ) was used as a forward primer and SHE2 - R1 ( 5 (cid:9) - AGTGGTACTTATTTGCTCTTTTTGAGCTAAAAACTGA - AGGCCGAATTCGAGCTCGTTTAAAC - 3 (cid:9) ) as a reverse primer . To disrupt SHE3 , we used SHE3 - F1 as a forward primer ( 5 (cid:9) - TATCAAGCACGCCAAG - GTTCAACGACACTACTTTTGTGTAAGGGTCGACGGATCCCCGGGTT - 3 (cid:9) ) and SHE3 - R1 as a reverse primer ( 5 (cid:9) - CTAAATGAATCCTATATATATA - CTCCCTTGTGTCGGCATATTGAATTCGAGCTCGTTTAAAC - 3 (cid:9) ) . Fluorescence microscopy To visualize the ER or mitochondria , cells expressing DsRed , GFP , YFP , or RFP fusion proteins were grown overnight in minimal or SC media at 30 (cid:3) C to an OD 600 of 0 . 3 , pelleted , and resuspended in 30 (cid:5) l of growth medium . Then 3 (cid:5) l of the cell suspension was mixed with an equal volume of growth medium containing 0 . 6 % NuSieve GTG low melting temperature agarose ( FMC BioProducts ) . Indirect immunofluorescence was performed according to Du et al . ( 2001 ) with the following modifications . To remove the cell wall , cells were incubated for 9 min at 30 (cid:3) C with gentle shaking in 1 ml of 100 mM sodium phosphate / 1 . 2 M sorbitol buffer ( pH 6 . 6 ) containing 143 mM (cid:10) - mercaptoethanol and 50 (cid:5) g / ml Zymolyase 100T ( Seikagaku America ) . Spheroplasts were then washed three times with 5 ml of 100 mM sodium phosphate / 1 . 2 M sorbitol buffer ( pH 6 . 6 ) and resuspended in 250 (cid:5) l of the same buffer . Subsequently , 30 (cid:5) l of cells were attached to eight - well slides coated with poly - L - lysine and permeabilized in 30 (cid:5) l of P buffer ( 1 (cid:11) PBS containing 0 . 1 % SDS and 10 mg / ml BSA ) for 5 min . To visualize vacuoles in wild - type and myo4 (cid:2) mutant cells , vacuole membranes were labeled with 80 (cid:5) M FM 4 - 64 ( Molecular Probes ) accord - ing to methods previously described ( Wang et al . , 1996 ; Du et al . , 2001 ) . Cells were observed with a Carl Zeiss MicroImaging , Inc . Axiophot fluo - rescence microscope using a 100 (cid:11) oil - immersion objective . Images were captured with an Orca ER digital camera ( model no . C4742 – 95 ; Hamamatsu Photonics ) and the OpenLab 3 . 08 imaging software ( OpenLab Inc . ) . Images were further processed with Adobe Photoshop 7 . 0 and Illustrator 10 . 0 . Lat - A treatment SFNY1061 ( Table III ) was grown in 5 ml of YPD overnight at 30 (cid:3) C to an OD 600 of 0 . 15 . Cells were harvested and resuspended in 200 (cid:5) l of YPD , and 25 (cid:5) l was subsequently mounted in an equal volume of medium con - taining 0 . 6 % low melting temperature agarose and 200 (cid:5) M Lat - A ( Molec - ular Probes ) . Cells were observed with a Carl Zeiss MicroImaging , Inc . fluorescence microscope immediately after Lat - A treatment . Time - lapse imaging Time - lapse fluorescence microscopy of SFNY1061 was performed on cells grown at 30 (cid:3) C in YPD to an OD 600 of 0 . 15 . Cells ( untreated or treated with 200 (cid:5) M Lat - A ) were mounted in 0 . 4 % agarose and viewed with a Carl Zeiss MicroImaging , Inc . fluorescence microscope . Images were captured using OpenLab software at 18 - s intervals for 3 min and exported as a Quicktime file . Image stills were generated using Adobe Photoshop 7 . 0 and Illustrator 10 . 0 . Rate of tubule movement The distance traveled was determined by measuring the tubule movement from the bud neck to the bud tip in time - lapse image stills . The ruler tool in the measurement module of OpenLab 3 . 1 . 3 was positioned on the tubule at the bud neck and was extended over the length of the tubule as it ex - tended toward the bud tip . The distance traveled by the tubule was then recorded in micrometers . To determine the rate of movement , the distance traveled was divided by the time a tubule approached the bud tip . The time was recorded and displayed in each image still . Rate measurements are reported as micrometers per second . Subcellular fractionation Cells were grown , converted to spheroplasts , and lysed in the absence or presence of 100 (cid:5) g / ml RNase A as described previously ( Barrowman et al . , 2000 ) . 66 OD 600 units were then fractionated on sucrose velocity gradients according to Barrowman et al . ( 2000 ) . Fractions ( (cid:2) 1 ml each ) were collected from the top of the gradient , and the protein in each fraction was precipitated by adding 500 (cid:5) l of cold 50 % trichloroacetic acid . The protein pellets were collected by centrifugation at 14 , 000 rpm for 5 min at 4 (cid:3) C , resuspended in 66 (cid:5) l of 1 M Tris , and solubilized in 99 (cid:5) l of SDS sample buffer . The frac - tions ( 30 (cid:5) l each ) were then resolved by SDS - PAGE and subjected to West - ern blot analysis . The antibodies were subsequently detected by ECL ( Amer - sham Biosciences ) , and the bands were quantitated using BioImage software . The data are plotted as a percent of the maximum antigenic material . The ER and plasma membrane were fractionated on a linear sucrose density gradient in the presence of EDTA as described previously ( Roberg et al . , 1997 ) . In brief , cells were grown to an OD 600 of 1 . 0 , harvested , and re - suspended in 0 . 5 ml of STE10 buffer ( 10 % [ wt / wt ] sucrose , 10 mM EDTA , 10 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 ) containing a protease inhibitor cocktail ( 10 (cid:5) M antipain , 30 (cid:5) M leupeptin , 30 (cid:5) M chymostatin , 1 (cid:5) M pepstatin A , 1 (cid:5) M PMSF , and 1 (cid:5) g / ml aprotinin ) . Cells were then lysed by vortexing with glass beads . After lysis , 1 ml of STE10 buffer was added , and the lysate was cleared of unbroken cells by centrifugation at 500 g . 15 OD 600 units ( (cid:2) 300 (cid:5) l of the lysate ) were layered on top of a 20 – 60 % linear sucrose gradient ( 5 ml ) prepared in TE ( 10 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 1 mM EDTA ) . Samples were then centrifuged at 100 , 000 g for 18 h at 4 (cid:3) C using an SW50 . 1 rotor ( Beck - man Coulter ) as described by Roberg et al . ( 1997 ) . Fractions ( (cid:2) 440 (cid:5) l each ) were collected from the top of the gradient , and the protein in each fraction was precipitated with 50 % TCA and processed as described above . The data are plotted as a percent of the maximum antigenic material . IST2 mRNA localization Localization of IST2 mRNA by in situ RNA hybridization using an IST2 an - tisense probe labeled with digoxigenin was performed as described previ - ously by Takizawa et al . ( 1997 , 2000 ) . Online supplemental material Videos 1 – 10 show time - lapse movies , at one frame per 6 s , of ER segrega - tion tubules aligning along the mother – bud axis and entering the bud in wild - type cells ( SFNY1061 ) expressing the ER marker Hmg1p - GFP .
