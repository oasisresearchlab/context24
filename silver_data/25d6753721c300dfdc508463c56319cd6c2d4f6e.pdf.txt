Methods : A retrospective cohort study with numerous COVID - 19 patients recruited was conducted in Shanghai . Epidemiological data including transmission details , demographics , vaccination status , symptoms , comorbidities , antigen test , living environment , residential ventilation , disinfection and medical treatment of each participant were collected and risk factors for family transmission were determined . Results : A total of 2 , 334 COVID - 19 patients participated . Compared with non - cohabitation infected patients , cohabitated ones were younger ( p = 0 . 019 ) , more commonly unvaccinated ( p = 0 . 048 ) or exposed to infections ( p < 0 . 001 ) , and had higher rates of symptoms ( p = 0 . 003 ) or shared living room ( p < 0 . 001 ) . Risk factors analysis showed that the 2019 - nCov antigen positive ( OR = 1 . 86 , 95 % CI 1 . 40 – 2 . 48 , p < 0 . 001 ) , symptoms development ( OR = 1 . 86 , 95 % CI 1 . 34 – 2 . 58 , p < 0 . 001 ) , direct contact exposure ( OR = 1 . 47 , 95 % CI 1 . 09 – 1 . 96 , p = 0 . 010 ) were independent risk factors for the cohabitant transmission of COVID - 19 , and a separate room with a separate toilet could reduce the risk of family transmission ( OR = 0 . 62 , 95 % CI 0 . 41 – 0 . 92 , p = 0 . 018 ) . Conclusion : Patients showing negative 2019 - nCov antigen tests , being asymptomatic , living in a separate room with a separate toilet , or actively avoiding direct contact with cohabitants were at low risk of family transmission , and the study recommended that avoiding direct contact and residential disinfection could reduce the risk of all cohabitants within the same house being infected with COVID - 19 .

Introduction Coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) is a highly contagious viral disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) , which had a catastrophic impact on global health , resulting in 656 million confirmed cases and a death toll up to 6 . 67 million worldwide till January 04 , 2023 ( Data from 2019ncov . chinacdc . cn ) ( 1 – 5 ) . The variant strain of Omicron is less virulent , but evolves toward highly contagious ( 6 – 9 ) . Shanghai , the biggest city of China with a population of 25 million , has been suffering a wave of sub - lineage of the Omicron variant . Due to its high transmission rate , the pandemic has caused a dramatic increase in the number of confirmed cases . According to the Shanghai Municipal Health Commission , as of May 4 , 2022 , 593 336 cases have been identified , and 503 people have died with or from COVID - 19 ( 10 ) . The first co - infection case with BA . 5 . 2 . 48 and BF . 7 . 14 has recently been reported in China ( 11 ) . Many COVID - 19 cases only showed mild symptoms or were asymptomatic , but a previous study showed us the transmission potential of asymptomatic patients ( 12 ) . Thus , to limit the spread of the disease , there is an urgent need for an evolutionary strategy to manage COVID - 19 patients . Studies had revealed that isolation of infected persons , mask use at home , disinfection and keeping social distancing were critical to reducing SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in household settings ( 13 – 15 ) . However , these had not been received much attention in the public health practice and we believed it deserved to be highlighted again . Considering that the home may be the smallest unit of population aggregation , scientific home quarantine is important for epidemic prevention to reduce the consumption of medical resources during the pandemic ( 16 – 19 ) . The WHO - China Joint Mission on COVID - 19 urged prioritization of studies on risk factors for household transmission ( 20 ) . Therefore , taking advantage of the event of Shanghai in 2022 , this study aimed to analyze the exposure sources and indoor transmission of 2 , 334 infected patients during home quarantine prior to shelter admission , to identify potential factors affecting home quarantine efficiency , and ultimately to provide precautionary guidelines for the general public during COVID - 19 waves . 2 . Materials and methods 2 . 1 . Study design and participants A retrospective cohort study was conducted from 10 March 2022 to 30 April 2022 . Patients who were confirmed with COVID - 19 by positive nucleic acid test ( a positive nucleic acid was defined as Ct value < 35 ( 21 ) ) and were transmitted to Fangcang shelter hospital were enrolled in this study . Relevant information including demographic data , exposure sources and transmission of each participant during home quarantine period before going to the shelter hospital were collected via telephone interviews and questionnaires . And potential factors affecting home quarantine efficiency were explored . The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital ( IRB number : L22 – 236 ) . Written informed consents were waived by the Ethics Commission of the designated hospitals because of retrospectively study related to this emerging public health . 2 . 2 . Data collection A standardized data collection spreadsheet was designed to obtain patients’ data from telephone interview and questionnaires ( data in Supplementary File 2 ) . All data collections were performed according to standardized protocol by researchers involved in this study . We defined cohabitation infection as the patient who became ill after direct contact with infected cohabitants , while non - cohabitation infection means that other cohabitants were not infected when the patient became infected , that is , she / he was the first person to be infected in the living environment . Two investigators independently reviewed the data collection forms to double check the validity of the data . Epidemiological data ( upstream exposure source information , number of infected persons , downstream infected persons’ information , etc . ) , demographics ( age , gender , BMI , occupation , educational level , vaccination information ) , symptoms onset ( respiratory , gastrointestinal , neurological , etc . ) , comorbidities , 2019 - nCov antigen test results , living environment , residential ventilation and disinfection , medical treatment were obtained for in - depth analysis . 2 . 3 . Outcomes The proportion of symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID - 19 patients and differential indicators between the two groups were evaluated . The sensitivity of the 2019 - nCov antigen test and differential indicators between patients with positive antigen test and negative antigen test were determined . Comparisons between non - cohabitation infection patients and cohabitated infection patients were performed and analyzed , and a household transmission rate of the epidemic was reported . Risk factors for household transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 Omicron variant during home quarantine were clarified . 2 . 4 . Statistical analysis The Kolmogorov – Smirnov test was applied for analyzing the distribution of quantitative variables . Quantitative data were presented as median ( interquartile range ) for non - normally distributed variables or mean ( standard deviation ) for normally distributed variables and qualitative data were presented as frequencies ( percentages ) . Independent group t - test was applied to analyze quantitative variables that were normally distributed and homoscedasticity , and the Mann – Whitney U test was applied to analyze quantitative variables that were non - normally distributed or not homoscedasticity . Qualitative variables between the two groups were compared by using Chi - square test or Fisher’s exact test . In the multivariate analysis , the logistic regression was used to determine risk factors associated with household transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 Omicron variant . Variables with significance level p < 0 . 1 in the univariate analysis were preliminary screened out and were entered into the multivariate regression model . The odds ratio ( OR ) and 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) were calculated for the independent variables . For all analyses , p < 0 . 05 was considered statistically significant . All statistical analyses and diagramming were performed by SPSS Liu et al . 10 . 3389 / fpubh . 2023 . 1170085 Frontiers in Public Health 03 frontiersin . org ( version 23 . 0 , IBM ) , GraphPad Prism ( version 8 . 0 , GraphPad Software Inc ) , Origin Pro ( version 2016 , OriginLab ) softwares . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . Demographic characteristics and symptom distribution A total of 2 , 334 confirmed COVID - 19 patients were included . Patients were aged 1 – 91 years with a median age of 43 years ( 31 – 54 ) , and 1 , 286 ( 55 . 1 % ) were male ( Table 1 ) . On the basis of their presentations prior to the examined day , 616 ( 26 . 4 % ) patients without any clinical signs or symptoms were classified as asymptomatic , while 1718 ( 73 . 6 % ) were classified as symptomatic . Compared with asymptomatic patients , symptomatic cases had higher rates of 2019 - nCov antigen positive ( 283 [ 52 . 2 % ] vs . 1 , 249 [ 76 . 2 % ] , p < 0 . 001 ) and household transmission ( 63 [ 9 . 9 % ] vs . 344 [ 20 . 0 % ] , p < 0 . 001 ) . A total of 2 , 181 ( 93 . 4 % ) patients completed the 2019 - nCov antigen test at the same time as the nucleic acid test and the sensitivity of the 2019 - nCov antigen test was 70 . 2 % ( 1532 ) in our study . Compared with 2019 - nCov antigen - negative patients , the proportion of 2019 - nCov antigen - positive patients who had symptoms ( 390 [ 60 . 1 % ] vs . 1 , 249 [ 81 . 5 % ] , p < 0 . 001 ) , medical treatment ( 352 [ 54 . 2 % ] vs . 1 , 108 [ 72 . 3 % ] , p < 0 . 001 ) , and downstream cohabitants transmission ( 71 [ 10 . 9 % ] vs . 315 [ 20 . 6 % ] , p < 0 . 001 ) were significantly higher ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . 3 . 2 . Differential characteristics of COVID - 19 patients with cohabitated infection and non - cohabitation infection In this study , we investigated the upstream potential exposure factors of patients and found that of the 2 , 334 patients enrolled , 698 ( 29 . 9 % ) patients were infected from their cohabitants , and 1 , 636 ( 70 . 1 % ) patients were infected from non - cohabitants . The diagnostic time line for the two groups was shown in Figure 1A . Compared with patients with non - cohabitation infection , patients with cohabitated infection were younger ( 43 [ 32 – 54 ] vs . 41 [ 29 – 54 ] , p = 0 . 019 ) , more common being unvaccinated ( 176 [ 10 . 9 % ] vs . 100 [ 14 . 3 % ] , p = 0 . 048 ) and having direct contact exposure ( 1 , 054 [ 68 . 9 % ] vs . 552 [ 82 . 4 % ] , p < 0 . 001 ) , had a higher rate of symptoms ( 1 , 175 [ 71 . 8 % ] vs . 543 [ 77 . 8 % ] , p = 0 . 003 ) and needed more medical treatment ( 1 , 050 [ 64 . 2 % ] vs . 486 [ 69 . 6 % ] , p = 0 . 011 ) , as TABLE 1 Differential characteristics between asymptomatic and symptomatic COVID - 19 cases .

We further analyzed the age of the upstream transmission source population , the enrolled patient population , and the downstream infected population , and found that downstream infected patients were significantly younger than upstream population and all enrolled patients ( 38 [ 25 – 54 ] vs . 46 [ 33 – 55 ] , p < 0 . 001 ; 38 [ 25 – 54 ] vs . 43 [ 31 – 54 ] , p < 0 . 001 ) ( Supplementary Figure S1 ) . In addition , the household transmission rate of patients with cohabitated infection was lower than that of patients with non - cohabitation infection ( 84 [ 12 . 0 % ] vs . 321 [ 19 . 6 % ] , p < 0 . 001 ) ( Table 2 ) . 3 . 3 . Independent factors associated with household transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 omicron variant during home quarantine There were 405 ( 17 . 4 % ) cases in which patients transmitted the disease to their cohabitants ( Figure 2A ) . The multivariate analysis of independent factors associated with household transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 Omicron variant during home quarantine was showed in Table 3 . Independent risk factors including 2019 - nCov antigen positive ( OR = 1 . 86 , 95 % CI 1 . 40 – 2 . 48 , p < 0 . 001 ) , symptoms development ( OR = 1 . 86 , 95 % CI 1 . 34 – 2 . 58 , p < 0 . 001 ) , direct contact exposure ( OR = 1 . 47 , 95 % CI 1 . 09 – 1 . 96 , p = 0 . 010 ) were associated with increased household transmission of the disease , while having a separate room with a separate toilet could reduce the risk of household transmission during home quarantine ( OR = 0 . 62 , 95 % CI 0 . 41 – 0 . 92 , p = 0 . 018 ) . Compared with patients who had no infection to cohabitants , patients that transmitted the disease to their cohabitants had higher rates of symptoms ( 1 , 374 [ 71 . 2 % ] vs . 344 [ 84 . 9 % ] , p < 0 . 001 ) ( Figure 2B ) , 2019 - nCov antigen positive ( 1 , 217 [ 67 . 8 % ] vs . 315 [ 81 . 6 % ] , p < 0 . 001 ) , direct contact exposure ( 1 , 285 [ 68 . 3 % ] vs . 321 [ 79 . 5 % ] , p < 0 . 001 ) ( Figure 2C ) , as well as a higher proportion of patients with living environment of a sharing room ( 1 , 193 [ 66 . 3 % ] vs . 307 [ 78 . 9 % ] , p < 0 . 001 ) ( Figure 2D ) . Considering that living environment significantly affected the spread of the disease among the cohabitants during home quarantine , we divided all patients into two groups with or without a separate room and a separate toilet , and analyzed the difference in the household transmission rates between the two groups . Results showed that the downstream household transmission rate of patients without a separate room and a separate toilet was significantly increased compared with that of patients with a separate room and a separate toilet ( 371 [ 18 . 8 % ] vs . 34 [ 9 . 4 % ] , p < 0 . 001 ) ( Figure 2E ) . 3 . 4 . Self - protection awareness of patients was closely related To whether all cohabitants within the same house were infected with SARS - CoV - 2 omicron variant during home quarantine Of the 2 , 334 patients enrolled in the study , all cohabitants of 811 ( 34 . 7 % ) patients were confirmed with COVID - 19 during home quarantine . Important characteristics of these 811 patients were summarized in Supplementary Table S2 . Patients were aged 1 – 89 years , with a median age of 41 years ( 30 – 54 ) , and 479 ( 59 . 1 % ) were male . Among them , 386 ( 47 . 6 % ) patients had completed three doses of vaccination , 605 ( 74 . 6 % ) patients had symptoms , 138 ( 17 . 2 % ) patients had comorbidity , 532 ( 65 . 9 % ) patients had taken medical treatment , only 94 ( 12 . 5 % ) patients had a living environment of a separate room and a separate toilet , and up to 631 ( 78 . 3 % ) patients had direct contact exposure with their cohabitants . In this population , the positive rate of 2019 - nCov antigen test of patients was 71 . 6 % ( 544 ) , and the cohabitants transmission rate of these patients was 21 . 6 % ( 175 ) . The multivariate results of independent factors associated with COVID - 19 infection in all cohabitants within the same house during home quarantine were shown in Table 4 . Direct contact exposure with cohabitants ( OR = 1 . 36 , 95 % CI 1 . 09 – 1 . 71 , p = 0 . 008 ) was an independent risk factor for the virus infection in all cohabitants within the same house during home quarantine , while residential disinfection could reduce this risk ( OR = 0 . 78 , 95 % CI 0 . 63 – 0 . 95 , p = 0 . 016 ) . 4 . Discussion It may lead to secondary or multiple transmission of the COVID - 19 if effective measures were not taken when families were infected . Studies showed that the outbreak of infection in a large population over a short time could easily lead to the emergence of new mutant strains . Minimizing the prevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 will reduce chances of forming recombinant lineages with genetic combinations that may increase the adaptability of the virus potentially ( 6 , 22 ) . It is particularly important to protect vulnerable groups such as the older adults , children and pregnant women by reducing household transmission of the disease effectively . And the Lancet was calling for the creation of a strong resilient health system and international preparedness strategies to control the pandemic ( 23 ) . Thus , our study analyzed and determined risk factors associated with household transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 Omicron variant through a large - scale epidemiological survey of 2 , 234 patients . Based on the results , we found a group of patients who were at low risk of transmission . They were patients with 2019 - nCov antigen negative , no relevant clinical symptoms , living in a separate room with a separate toilet , and actively avoiding direct contact with cohabitants . SARS - CoV - 2 is more transmissible in households than SARS - CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( 24 ) . The long incubation period and high presymptomatic contagiousness of COVID - 19 make transmission among family members a special risk ( 25 , 26 ) . Evidence on the spread of SARS - CoV - 2 Omicron variant during home quarantine has been reported in different countries , while characteristics of family transmission of the COVID - 19 pandemic and important factors associated with it were still poorly understood ( 5 , 13 , 27 , 28 ) . In this study , we observed that the household transmission rate of the Omicron variant was 17 . 4 % , which was much lower than that reported in the United States ( 52 . 7 % ) and South Korea ( 50 . 0 % ) ( 13 , 29 ) . In addition , Madewell et al . systematically analyzed the household secondary attack rates of Omicron variant from seven foreign studies and found that the overall household secondary attack rate was 42 . 7 % ( 35 . 4 – 50 . 4 % ) ( 30 ) , which was also higher than that in Shanghai in 2022 . The heterogeneity in household transmission rates in different regions may be due to differences in control measures , surveillance practices , and household crowding .

Liu et al . 10 . 3389 / fpubh . 2023 . 1170085 Frontiers in Public Health 06 frontiersin . org Studies had revealed that many factors could influence the secondary transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 in households , including isolation of infected persons , mask use at home , disinfection and social distancing ( 13 , 14 ) . In addition to these factors , our study showed that 2019 - nCov antigen positive and symptoms development were independent risk factors for family transmission of the disease .

It had been reported that viral load in asymptomatic patients was comparable to that in symptomatic patients , suggesting the transmission potential of asymptomatic patients ( 12 , 31 ) . However , Li et al . found that asymptomatic patients were less likely to infect others than symptomatic cases , and symptomatic cases were more infectious during the incubation period than those during the symptomatic period ( 20 ) . These were consistent with our finding that symptomatic cases had higher rates of household transmission than that of asymptomatic patients . Antigen - based rapid tests have important diagnostic value early in the course of disease , which showed relatively FIGURE 2 Comparisons of differential factors of COVID - 19 patients with and without cohabitation transmission . Panel ( A ) showed the proportion of patients who transmitted the disease to their cohabitants in total patients ; Differences in the number of symptoms , and the proportion of 2019 - nCov antigen positive , direct contact exposure and living environments between COVID - 19 patients with cohabitants transmission and those without cohabitants transmission were shown in panel ( B – D ) ; Differences in the number of cohabitants transmission between COVID - 19 patients with separate room separate toilet and those without separate room separate toilet was shown in panel ( E ) . * * * p < 0 . 001 .

It had been reported that the average sensitivity of commercial antigen assays was higher in symptomatic compared to asymptomatic participants ( 33 ) , and antigen - based rapid diagnostic test sensitivity was higher in the first 7 days after symptom onset than that in asymptomatic patients ( 34 ) . Similarly , symptomatic patients had a higher proportion of positive 2019 - nCov antigen testing than asymptomatic patients in this study . These may be related to the different courses of the disease in the two groups of patients when the antigen testing was performed . The above provided possible explanations why 2019 - nCov antigen positive , symptomatic patients were at a higher risk of household transmission during home quarantine . The spread of the novel coronavirus was associated with exposure to fomites , aerosols , and droplets , especially in the crowded or confined spaces ( 8 , 35 ) . It had been reported that the risk and probability of being caught by the indoor COVID - 19 disease increased in time , particularly in the downstream of a localized infectious person ( 36 ) . A previous study provided the evidence of the effectiveness of social distancing in preventing COVID - 19 ( 14 ) , which was consistent with our findings that direct contact exposure could increase the risk of home transmission , and the living conditions of a separate room with a separate toilet could protect the cohabitants from infection . Randomized clinical trials had shown that hand hygiene alone did not prevent respiratory transmissible viruses , but the combination of masks did work ( 37 ) . Importantly , our study showed that , except for the uncontrollable conditions of the patient , it could greatly reduce the spread of the disease during home quarantine by improving hygiene measures such as avoiding direct contact with cohabitants and actively disinfecting the house , and providing separate living space for infected cohabitants , thereby greatly reducing the risk that all of the family members becoming infected . In addition , we found that patients with cohabitation infection were younger than those with non - cohabitation infection .

While most young patients were less active , and their infection mainly came from contacting with their infected cohabitants . Moreover , the living environment of these people was mainly of sharing room , and the proportion of isolated conditions with a separate room and a separate toilet was very small , making it difficult to avoid contact with infected cohabitants . These indicated that home quarantine conditions played a very important role in the spread of the epidemic within the household . It is noteworthy that the number of vaccinations was not an independent risk factor of home transmission in our study . Similarly , previous studies observed in some countries that , the vaccination offered less protect against the spread of disease , since some portions of vaccinated people were not totally immunized ( 38 , 39 ) . Our study has several limitations . Telephone interviews have inherent limitations , including recall bias . In addition , we could not collect baseline information on uninfected cohabitants of enrolled patients , and therefore could not do a comparative analysis . Besides , the study could only define that the non - cohabitation infection originated from social contact , and could not exclude other infection risks . In conclusion , important factors revealed in this study , including negative 2019 - nCov antigen tests , absence of associated clinical symptoms , living in a separate room with a separate toilet , and active avoidance of direct contact with cohabitants , will inform precautionary guidelines for all families to reduce household transmission during the waves of COVID - 19 pandemic , and the study recommended that avoiding direct contact and residential disinfection could reduce the risk of all cohabitants within the same house being infected with COVID - 19 .
