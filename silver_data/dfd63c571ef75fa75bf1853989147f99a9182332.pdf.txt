Correspondence : Sutherland K Maciver . E - mail : SKM @ srv4 . med . ed . ac . uk Summary The ADF / cofilins are a family of actin - binding proteins expressed in all eukaryotic cells so far examined . Members of this family remodel the actin cytoskeleton , for example during cytokinesis , when the actin - rich contractile ring shrinks as it contracts through the interaction of ADF / cofilins with both monomeric and filamentous actin . The depolymerizing activity is twofold : ADF / cofilins sever actin filaments and also increase the rate at which monomers leave the filament’s pointed end . The three - dimensional structure of ADF / cofilins is similar to a fold in members of the gelsolin family of actin - binding proteins in which this fold is typically repeated three or six times ; although both families bind polyphosphoinositide lipids and actin in a pH - dependent manner , they share no obvious sequence similarity . Plants and animals have multiple ADF / cofilin genes , belonging in vertebrates to two types , ADF and cofilins . Other eukaryotes ( such as yeast , Acanthamoeba and slime moulds ) have a single ADF / cofilin gene . Phylogenetic analysis of the ADF / cofilins reveals that , with few exceptions , their relationships reflect conventional views of the relationships between the major groups of organisms .

The actin - depolymerizing factors ( ADFs , also known as destrins ) and the cofilins are a single family called the ADF / cofilins . They are abundant and essential in almost every eukaryotic cell type , with the possible exception of red blood cells and sperm cells ( see [ 1 , 2 ] for comprehensive reviews ) . Chromosomal locations of selected ADF / cofilin genes are shown in Table 1 ( available with the complete version of this article , online ) . Gene organization and evolutionary history An analysis of the available ADF / cofilin sequences has been performed ( Figure 1 ) and this agrees well with previous analyses on more limited datasets [ 3 - 5 ] . Most vertebrates have one ADF and two cofilins , and the cofilins are divided into muscle and non - muscle cofilins . The recently reported destrin - 2 gene is most likely a pseudogene . Xenopus has two ADF / cofilins ; these appear to be more closely related to the cofilins than the ADFs , but the possibility that Xenopus also has an ADF cannot presently be excluded . There is one known chicken ADF / cofilin , a cofilin more similar to the mouse muscle cofilin than to non - muscle cofilin . Nematodes have one ADF / cofilin , unc - 60 ( see below ) . Perhaps surpris - ingly , plants have many more ADF / cofilin genes than animals : Arabidopsis has 12 , some of which may be pseudo - genes . Using a limited dataset , Mun et al . [ 3 ] classified the plant ADF / cofilins into four groups ( I - IV ) , and we support this classification but subdivide groups I and II into two sub - groups and group III into three subgroups . It is not yet clear how many of the Arabidopsis ADF / cofilin ( AtADF ) genes are expressed , but cDNAs have been isolated for most [ 15 ] . The AtADF genes are clustered : AtADF3 and AtADF4 are adja - cent on chromosome 5 and a putative ADF gene is followed 2 Genome Biology Vol 3 No 5 Maciver and Hussey by ADF2 and immediately by ADF1 on chromosome 3 . Most lower eukaryotes have only one or two ADF / cofilin genes . Further details of the distribution of ADF / cofilin genes are available with the complete version of this article , online . Gene structure The intron - exon boundaries often provide information on the ontogeny and evolution of genes . As expected , there are several such boundaries within ADF / cofilin genes , and these are pre - served across the phyla . A remarkable tendency for ADF / cofilin genes is for the first amino acid ( or the first few ) to be encoded by a separate exon ( Figure 2b ) . The human muscle cofilin gene ( Clf2 ) produces two different mRNAs that encode identical polypeptides by the use of two alternative first exons encoding the methionine and upstream untranslated region ; these mRNAs presumably differ in their localization and / or stability [ 19 ] . The opposite is true for the muscle ADF / cofilin of the nematode C . elegans : two different ADF / cofilin proteins are produced from one gene , although the only exon to be shared is that encoding the initiating methionine . The S . cere - visiae Cof1 gene contains one exon in the region encoding the amino terminus of the protein [ 20 ] , as does one of the two genes encoding identical proteins in Dictyostelium discoideum . Several ADF / cofilin genes , for example those from Schizosaccharomyces pombe , Entamoeba histolytica and Strongylocentrotus purpuratus ) , have no introns , but some of these have yet to be shown to be functional genes . Genes that contain no introns are likely to be pseudogenes [ 21 , 22 ] , so those ADF / cofilin genes identified solely on the basis of their genomic sequence ( such as those from E . his - tolytica and S . purpuratus ) must be verified by cDNA cloning . This rule also appears to hold for human ADF genes ; a number of pseudogenes homologous to ADF / cofilin genes lacking introns are suspected ( such as those with GenBank accession numbers AC009498 ( chromosome 2 ) and AL132765 ( chromo - some 20 ) ) . As far as can currently be determined , plant ADF / cofilin genes are organized in a similar manner , with an intron following the exon encoding the amino terminus and a conserved intron further 3 (cid:1) . This pattern holds for Arabidopsis and Oryza sativa ADF / cofilin genes . Characteristic structural features The ADF / cofilins are formed by a single folded domain , the ADF homology domain , which is also found in other actin - binding protein families , including Abp1p , drebrins [ 23 ] , twinfilin [ 24 ] and coactosin [ 25 ] ( Figure 3 ) . The ADF / cofilins themselves vary in size from 113 amino acids ( E . tenella ) to 168 amino acids ( both Xenopus laevis pro - teins ) . Despite the considerable variation in sequence and size across the ADF / cofilin family , the structures so far avail - able ( Table 2 , available with the complete version of this article , online , Figure 2a ) show that they share a remarkably conserved fold . The main actin - binding structure of the ADF / cofilins is the long (cid:2) helix starting , for example in human destrin , at Leu111 and terminating at Phe128 . Most ADF / cofilins contain at least one nuclear - localization signal ( NLS ) close to the amino terminus . Interestingly , even those ADF / cofilins , such as those of Dictyostelium and Zea mays , that lack the classic bipartite NLS can still be induced to enter the nucleus when the cells are treated with either 10 % dimethylsulfoxide [ 22 ] or cytochalasin D [ 26 ] . Many ADF / cofilins are known to associate with the phospholipid phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) [ 16 , 27 , 28 ] , and a short sequence ( Trp100 - Met115 ; see Figure 2 ) has been identified that is important for binding to both actin and PIP 2 [ 29 ] . The analogous region of Acanthamoeba actophorin also contains overlapping sites for both actin and PIP 2 , explaining the competition observed between the two ligands [ 30 ] . Localization and function Subcellular localization ADF / cofilins are usually localized in parts of the cell where there is a high turnover of actin filaments , such as the leading edge of moving animal cells [ 16 , 31 - 33 ] and the growing tips of plant cells [ 26 ] . The main activity of ADF / cofilins has been found from in vitro experiments to be to increase actin - fila - ment turnover [ 5 , 34 , 35 ] . They accomplish this by severing actin filaments and increasing the rate at which actin monomers leave the pointed end of actin filaments ( see below ) . The rate at which actin filaments depolymerize is the rate - dependent step in the overall turnover of filaments that comes about as cells move forwards [ 36 ] . Cells lacking cofilin have impaired locomotion [ 37 ] , and those over - expressing cofilins are more motile [ 38 ] . The effects are specific to certain types of actin filaments : older filaments ( those at the base of leading lamellae ) are ‘marked’ for turnover ; the mark arises because they tend to contain more ADP - actin monomers and it is with these that the ADF / cofilins preferentially interact [ 34 , 35 ] . ADF / cofilins are also necessary for cytokinesis , depolymerizing the contractile ring between daughter cells as Figure 1 ( see figure on the next page ) A phylogenetic tree of the ADF / cofilin family . The groups and subgroups of plant ADF / cofilins are separated by dotted lines . An alignment of the complete sequences was made with Clustal W ; this was used to derive a phylogenetic tree with Clustal W using bootstrapping ( 1 , 000 reiterations ) and the output tree was plotted using the Njplot program . The data were taken from the published literature , expressed sequence tag databases and genomic databases . Arabidopsis thaliana ADF1 - ADF9 are named in accordance with Bowman et al . , 2000 [ 4 ] with an additional sequence ADF10 from GenBank ( AAF78408 ) . The petunia ( Petunia hybrida ) and cotton ( Gossypium hirsutum ) ADF / cofilins are numbered in accordance with Mun et al . , 2000 [ 3 ] . The alignment generated for this analysis and other information relating to this article and the ADF / cofilins generally is available from the authors’ ADF / cofilin home page [ 76 ] .

ADF / cofilins localize to the contractile ring [ 39 ] , and cells lacking ADF / cofilins are defective in cytokinesis [ 11 ] . In addition to their role in microfilament recycling , ADF / cofilins are also found in actin - rich , spicule - like rods found in stressed cells , in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus [ 26 , 40 ] . ADF / cofilins are also targeted to the nucleus upon heat shock and chemical stress . It may be that actin is taken into the nucleus in this manner so that a pool of tightly packed actin is protected from denaturation , and is then available after the stress is removed . ADF is known to inhibit actin denaturation , supporting this hypothesis [ 41 ] . The localization of ADF / cofilins in plant cells is broadly similar to that in animal and protist cells - they are primar - ily concentrated in regions rich in dynamic actin structures - but pollen and vegetative ADFs appear to have different properties . Pollen ADF has been seen to bind filamentous ( F - ) actin in vivo in mature pollen , dehydrated pollen and at adhesions between the tip of the pollen - tube and an adjacent substrate . Taken together with the fact that lily pollen ADF has an inefficient actin - depolymerizing activ - ity , these data suggest that pollen ADFs serve to bind and remodel F - actin structures , presumably in cooperation with other actin - binding proteins [ 42 ] . In contrast , given that the maize vegetative ZmADF3 locates to the tip of growing root - hair cells , is not seen to co - localize with F - actin in vivo and has an effective actin - depolymerizing activity , its principal role appears to be to increase the turnover of actin filaments . In root - hair cells , the effect of increased actin dynamics at the hair tip would be to promote root - hair growth [ 26 ] . 4 Genome Biology Vol 3 No 5 Maciver and Hussey Figure 2 The structure of ADF / cofilins . ( a ) The three major groups of ADF / cofilins identified in Figure 1 ( plants , fungi and vertebrates ) are each represented by a structure . The predominant structural features ( (cid:2) helices and (cid:3) sheets ) are shown in colors that correspond to those used in ( b ) , which shows the genomic organization of ADF / cofilins superimposed on the amino - acid sequence , with secondary structures highlighted . The red squares or bars indicate the positions of introns interrupting the deduced amino - acid sequences . Red underlining represents the PIP 2 / actin - binding site [ 30 ] . H 4 Helix 1 H 4 Helix 3 H 3 S 1 S 2 S 3 S 3 S 5 S 6 S 6 Helix 3 H 3 S 3 S 5 S 2 H 2 S . cerevisae Cof1 A . thaliana ADF1 H . sapiens ADF1 ( a ) ( b ) Helix 1 Expression In vertebrates , a single ADF gene is expressed in most tissues [ 32 ] , and ADF tends to have a reciprocal pattern of expression compared with the cofilins , with either the cofilins ( generally ) or ADF being more abundant . Both ADF and non - muscle cofilin are abundant in brain , both expressed at very low levels in liver and mature muscle [ 43 ] . The pattern of expression for most of the AtADF s has yet to be determined , but AtADF1 and AtADF4 are expressed in the vascular tissues in the entire plant and AtADF5 is expressed at the tip of the root meristem [ 15 ] . Dictyostelium Cofilin - 2 is expressed specifically at the aggregation stage of Dictyostelium development . Function The ADF / cofilins appear to have multiple functions , and this is reflected in their very complex association with monomeric and filamentous actin . They depolymerize actin filaments during , for example , cytokinesis [ 11 , 39 ] , cell locomotion [ 36 , 37 ] , and plant - cell elongation [ 26 ] , in addition to being involved in cellular stress responses [ 44 ] and pathological situations [ 45 ] . ADF / cofilins are regulated by pH [ 31 , 46 , 47 ] , polyphosphoinositides [ 16 , 27 , 28 , 31 ] , phosphorylation [ 48 - 51 ] , nucleotides bound by actin [ 36 ] and the presence of other actin - binding proteins [ 52 - 54 ] . They are , so far , unique among the actin - binding protein families in that they alter the twist of the actin filament [ 55 ] . ADFs and cofilins have very similar properties in vitro , but are present in varying relative concen - trations in cells and , where they appear in the same cell as each other , interesting differences in behavior have been noted [ 31 ] . Rather surprisingly , the distribution of ADF but not cofilin is modulated by intracellular pH in mouse cells . The two ADF / cofilins encoded by the C . elegans unc - 60 gene , UNC - 60A and UNC - 60B [ 10 ] , have distinct actin - binding properties , but understanding this is further complicated by the discovery that UNC - 60B behaves differently with respect to its interaction with rabbit muscle actin and actin from the nematode itself [ 56 ] . The most dramatic difference is that UNC - 60A binds much more weakly to F - actin at pH 7 . 0 than does UNC - 60B [ 10 ] . The carboxy - terminal domain of UNC - 60B is essential in F - actin binding and it has been postulated to constitute a second actin - binding site [ 57 ] . The actin - binding properties of Drosophila Twinstar [ 11 ] have not yet been characterized . Mechanism and regulation The mechanism by which actin filaments are depolymerized by ADF / cofilins has been controversial and the details are still far from clear . Filaments are depolymerized by severing and by an increase in the rate at which actin monomers fall off the pointed end of the actin filament . Phosphorylation is a principal regulator of ADF / cofilin function : ADF / cofilins are phosphorylated on an amino - terminal serine ( Ser3 in human non - muscle cofilin ) by LIM kinases 1 and 2 , TESK 1 [ 58 ] and TESK 2 [ 59 ] , and maize ADF3 is phosphorylated by a calmodulin - like domain protein kinase [ 50 , 51 ] . Phospho - rylation by all these kinases prevents ADF / cofilins from binding actin ( Figure 4 ) . Many ADF / cofilins , including vertebrate ADF and cofilins [ 28 ] , Acanthamoeba actophorin [ 16 ] , Zea mays ADF3 [ 27 ] , and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Cof1 , have been found to bind PIP 2 and , to a lesser extent , phosphatidylinositol - 4 - phosphate . Some of the actin - binding interfaces of ADF / cofilins partially overlap with the binding site of PIP 2 [ 30 ] , explaining why PIP 2 dissociates the actin - ADF / cofilin complex . In turn , ADF / cofilins reciprocally affect the metabolism of the polyphosphoinositides . Vertebrate cofilins [ 29 ] inhibit the hydrolysis of PIP 2 by phospholipase C , as does Zea mays ADF3 [ 27 ] . Binding of ADF / cofilins by PIP 2 , and perhaps by ion channels , may help to localize ADF / cofilins to the membrane , where they function to increase actin - filament turnover as well as to modulate PIP 2 metabolism . Both Acanthamoeba actophorin [ 60 ] and sea star depactin [ 61 ] have been reported not to be pH - sensitive , although c o mm e n t r e v i e w s r e p o r t s d e p o s i t e d r e s e a r c h i n t e r a c t i o n s i n f o r m a t i o n r e f e r ee d r e s e a r c h http : / / genomebiology . com / 2002 / 3 / 5 / reviews / 3007 . 5 Figure 3 Relationships of ADF / cofilins with other actin - binding proteins . The ADF / cofilins are composed of a single fold ( the ADF homology domain ) , which has sequence similarity with a domain found in drebrins , coactosin , twinfilin and Abp1p . It is not yet certain if the fold of these two domains is similar . The fold of the ADF homology domain is similar to a domain found in the gelsolin family ( the ‘gelsolin fold’ ) , despite very low sequence similarity between the two . Gelsolin Severin , Fragmin ADF / cofilins Twinfilin Coactosin SH 3 Abp1p ADF homology domain Domain with sequence similarity to the ADF homology domain Gelsolin fold they are in other respects typical ADF / cofilins . No obvious relationship between sequence and pH sensitivity is yet apparent , and pH dependence has been reported for many ADF / cofilins , including vertebrate ADF [ 41 , 47 ] and cofilins [ 46 ] , Arabidopsis thaliana ADF1 [ 34 ] , Zea mays ADF3 [ 27 ] , and the ADF / cofilins of Saccharomyces cerevisiae [ 20 ] , Petunia hybrida [ 3 ] , Triticum aestivum [ 14 ] , and the acomplexan Toxoplasma gondii [ 17 ] . Frontiers Recently , some of the detail of how ADF / cofilins fit into various signaling cascades has come to light , and this continues to be a growing area of research . Another major task that is awaited is the construction of a detailed structural picture of how exactly ADF / cofilins bind and sever actin and increase the monomer release rate . It is known that the ADF / cofilins induce a remarkable ( and so far unique ) increase in the twist of the actin filament , but it is controversial how this is accomplished . One view is that ADF / cofilins bind between the two longitudinally associated actin monomers by binding a second actin - binding site [ 62 ] , but this is in disagreement with other models in which ADF / cofilins are placed on the filament surface [ 63 - 65 ] . The crystallographic solution of the structure of cofilin - saturated actin filaments is an obvious but very ambitious goal that would resolve these issues .

In many cell types , the LIM kinases regulate ADF / cofilin activity by phosphorylation . LIM kinases are themselves activated by a host of upstream kinases including the Rho - activated kinase ROCK , Ca 2 + and phospholipid - dependent kinase protein kinase C and Rac - activated kinase PAK1 , which are in turn activated by small G proteins or diacyglycerol ( DAG ) . Phosphorylated ADF / cofilins do not bind actin . Perhaps counterintuitively , the severing and depolymerization of actin filaments by ADF / cofilins is activated by phosphorylation , as this leads to dissociation of ADF / cofilin from actin , leaving it free to sever and depolymerize actin once more after it is dephosphorylated by phosphatase activity . Depolymerization would be increased further if ADF / cofilin phosphatase activity as well as LIM kinase activity were increased .
