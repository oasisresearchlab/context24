According to current concepts , the complex route whereby APP moves between the secretory compartment , the cell surface and endosomes to encounter the various secretases determines its processing fate . However , the molecular mechanisms that control the intracellular trafficking of APP in neurons and their contribution to AD remain poorly understood . Here , we describe the functional elucidation of a new sorting receptor SORLA that emerges as a central regulator of trafficking and processing of APP . SORLA interacts with distinct sets of cytosolic adaptors for anterograde and retrograde movement of APP between the trans - Golgi network and early endosomes , thereby restricting delivery of the precursor to endocytic compartments that favor amyloidogenic breakdown . Defects in SORLA and its interacting adaptors result in transport defects and enhanced amyloidogenic processing of APP , and represent important risk factors for AD in patients . As discussed here , these findings uncovered a unique regulatory pathway for the control of neuronal protein transport , and provide clues as to why defects in this pathway cause neurodegenerative disease . Key words : APP , Alzheimer disease , VPS10 - domain receptors , Protein transport , Retromer Introduction Alzheimer disease ( AD ) is a neurodegenerative disorder and the most common form of age - related dementia . AD is characterized by progressive memory loss and cognitive impairment , which is accompanied by structural anomalies , such as widespread neuronal degeneration and neuritic plaques in the brain of affected individuals ( Blennow et al . , 2006 ) . The ‘amyloid cascade’ hypothesis represents a widely accepted concept for the description of the cellular events underlying neurodegenerative processes in AD ( see Box 1 for details ) ( Selkoe , 1991 ; Hardy and Higgins , 1992 ; Selkoe , 2011 ) . Pivotal to the amyloid cascade hypothesis is the amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) , a 110 – 130 kDa type - 1 transmembrane glycoprotein of poorly characterized function that is found in many cell types . It is expressed in three isoforms APP 695 , APP 751 and APP 770 , which all share a short amino acid peptide sequence as part of their transmembrane and extracellular domains . In a natural process that occurs in many cell types , this peptide sequence is liberated from the precursor polypeptides by proteolytic cleavage to produce amyloid b peptides ( A b ) of various fragment length ( 37 – 43 amino acid residues ) . Some of these peptides , notably A b 42 , exhibit a pronounced tendency to aggregate into neurotoxic oligomers and amyloid plaques , which are pathological hallmarks of AD . Evidence that the extent of proteolytic breakdown of APP to A b is a determinant of AD progression stems from rare inheritable forms of the disease ( familial AD , FAD ) . They are caused by mutations in the genes encoding either APP or presenilin - 1 and - 2 , which are components of the c - secretase complex responsible for APP proteolysis . Typically , FAD mutations are associated with an overall increase in the production of A b peptides or with a shift towards generation of the more amyloidogenic variant A b 42 , both mechanisms that cause the early onset of neurodegeneration ( Box 1 ) ( Karran et al . , 2011 ) . FAD mutations have been instrumental in deciphering defects in A b production as the plausible cause of early - onset AD , but it is more difficult to determine whether the aberrant build up of A b and its underlying mechanisms also represent a cause for the common late - onset form of AD . However , recent findings now show that disturbances in the complex path , by which APP traffics through the intracellular compartments of neurons in order to be cleaved by secretases , also represent a major cause of sporadic AD . In this Commentary , we review the molecular pathways , including the functional characterization of a unique sorting receptor SORLA , that govern proper trafficking and processing of APP , and discuss why defects in these pathways result in sporadic AD . Cellular trafficking of APP controls processing fates Early on during studies on APP processing , the notion emerged that the trafficking path , by which APP moves through the intracellular compartments of neurons , is a decisive factor in controlling its proteolytic processing . Among other evidence , this idea was initiated by the findings that secretases reside in distinct organelles of the cell , and that the ability of APP to enter or avoid certain cellular compartments determines its amyloidogenic versus non - amyloidogenic processing fates . In this section , we describe the complex trafficking path of APP , and the intrinsic ARTICLE SERIES : Cell Biology and Disease Commentary 2751 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e properties of this protein that are essential for this routing . Obviously , regulatory pathways that direct secretases to their destined location in the cell are similarly important , and the reader is referred to several recent reviews on this particular topic ( Sannerud and Annaert , 2009 ; Tang , 2009 ; Haass et al . , 2012 ; Rajendran and Annaert , 2012 ) . Newly synthesized APP molecules follow the constitutive secretory pathway of the cell and move from the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) through the Golgi complex and trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) to the plasma membrane ( Fig . 1A ) . En route , APP is subject to extensive post - translational modifications , Box 1 . The amyloid cascade hypothesis APP 695 is the main APP isoform expressed in neurons and undergoes two alternative processing pathways that determine the onset and progression of neurodegenerative processes ( Selkoe , 2011 ) . In one pathway ( figure , from the middle to the right ) , APP is first cleaved within the A b peptide sequence by the protease a - secretase , which produces soluble ( sAPP a ) and a membrane - anchored fragment C83 . Subsequently , c - secretase activity cleaves C83 into peptide P3 and the APP intracellular domain ( AICD ) . Several members of the disintegrin and metalloprotease ( ADAM ) family , particularly ADAM10 , are candidate a - secretases ( Kuhn et al . , 2010 ) . c - secretase is a multimeric complex of presenilin , nicastrin , anterior pharynx defective - 1 ( APH1 ) , and presenilin enhancer - 2 ( Pen - 2 , also known as PSENEN ) . Because cleavage by a - secretase destroys the A b peptide , this pathway acts in a non - amyloidogenic manner . By contrast , the amyloidogenic pathway is initiated by the cleavage of APP by b - secretase ( b - site APP cleaving enzyme - 1 ; BACE1 ) at the N - terminal end of A b , followed by c - secretase cleavage at its carboxyl terminus ( Vassar et al . , 1999 ; Cai et al . , 2001 ) . These steps produce A b peptides , of mainly 40 to 42 amino acids , as well as sAPP b and the AICD ( left part of the figure ) . Numerous functions have been assigned to APP and its various processing products ( reviewed in Mattson , 1997 ; Pardossi - Piquard and Checler , 2012 ) . For example , APP acts in cell adhesion , whereas sAPP a is believed to cooperate with the epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) receptor pathway to stimulate adult neurogenesis . A b modulates synaptic transmission by inducing the removal of glutamate receptors from the synaptic plasma membrane . The cytoplasmic tail of full - length APP , as well as the membrane - associated fragments C99 and C83 , interact with multiple adaptors and signaling molecules that are involved in cellular differentiation pathways . The AICD might act as a transcriptional regulator through its association with the adaptor Fe65 and the histone acetyltransferase Tip60 in the nucleus . The amino acid sequence of the human A b peptide ( highlighted in blue ) and of adjacent residues in APP are given below the figure . A total of 24 different point mutations that cause familial Alzheimer disease ( FAD ) are known , all of which cluster in or close to the A b sequence ( Karran et al . , 2011 ) . Three prototypic mutations are also depicted in the figure . The Swedish mutation ( KM670 / 671NL ) localizes proximal to the b - secretase cleavage site and causes a threefold increase in overall production of A b ( Mullan et al . , 1992 ) . The London mutation ( V717I ) alters the activity of c - secretase and results in a shift in production from A b 40 to the more amyloidogenic variant A b 42 ( Goate et al . , 1991 ) . The Arctic mutation ( E693G ) results in the generation of a mutant A b peptide with altered aggregation properties ( Kamino et al . , 1992 ) . sAPP α sAPP α C99 APP C83 AICD AICD P3 A β 40 or 42 γ α γ 40 γ 42 ISEVKM TVIVITLVMLKK DAEFRHDSGYEVHHQKLVFFAEDVGSNKGAIIGLMVGGVVIA NL G I Swedish Arctic London β γ β α TGN Lateendosome Earlyendosomes Earlyendosomes APP LRP1B APOER2 AP2 Clathrin Early endosome Earlyendosome α α β γ β γ β γ β γ Export to cell surface Clathrin - mediated endocytosis Facilitation of endocytosis Delay of endocytosis Transport to late endosomes Retrograde transport to TGN Fe65 Fe65 ? LRP1 APP F - spondin A B Fig . 1 . APP trafficking in cells . ( A ) Newly synthesized APP molecules traverse the Golgi and TGN to the plasma membrane where most precursor molecules are cleaved by a - secretase ( a ) . Non - processed precursors internalize from the cell surface through clathrin - mediated endocytosis , which is guided by the interaction between the cytoplasmic tail of APP and the clathrin adaptor AP2 . From early endosomes , APP moves to the late endosomal - lysosomal compartments or retrogradely to the TGN . Amyloidogenic processing of internalized APP through sequential cleavage by b - and c - secretases ( b , c ) is believed to proceed in endosomes and in the TGN . ( B ) Internalization of APP is controlled by LRPs , a group of endocytic receptors expressed in neurons and many other cell types . Fe65 - mediated association of APP with LRP1 on the cell surface facilitates its endocytic uptake and intracellular processing to A b . By contrast , binding to the slow - endocytosing receptors apolipoprotein E receptor 2 ( APOER2 , also known as LRP8 ) and LRP1B delays endocytosis but promotes cleavage to sAPP a . Binding of APP to APOER2 is mediated through Fe65 and F - spondin . The mode of interaction between LRP1B and APP might also involve Fe65 or yet unknown adaptors . Journal of Cell Science 126 ( 13 ) 2752 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e including N - and O - linked glycosylation , phosphorylation and sulfation ( reviewed in Haass et al . , 2012 ) . At the plasma membrane , most APP molecules are cleaved by a - secretase to release soluble sAPP a . However , some precursor molecules escape this non - amyloidogenic processing and are internalized by the cell surface through clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Internalization is guided by an NPxY motif in the cytoplasmic tail of APP ( Lai et al . , 1995 ; Marquez - Sterling et al . , 1997 ) . This motif is found in many endocytic receptors and facilitates their interaction with the clathrin adaptor complex AP2 ( Boll et al . , 2002 ) . From the early endosomes , APP typically moves to the late endosomal or lysosomal compartment , or retrogradely to the TGN . Extensive experimental evidence suggests that this fraction of endocytosed APP molecules is subjected to amyloidogenic processing . For example , blocking of APP endocytosis by deletion of its NPxY motif ( Perez et al . , 1999 ) or by overexpression of dominant - negative dynamin mutants impairs A b production ( Chyung and Selkoe , 2003 ; Carey et al . , 2005 ) . Most studies suggest that amyloidogenic processing proceeds in early or late endosomes ( Golde et al . , 1992 ; Haass et al . , 1992 ; Koo and Squazzo , 1994 ; Ikin et al . , 1996 ; Rajendran et al . , 2008 ; Sannerud et al . , 2011 ) . The predominant localization of b - secretase to endosomal compartments ( Huse et al . , 2000 ; Pastorino et al . , 2002 ; Sannerud et al . , 2011 ) and the requirement of an acidic milieu ( as in the case of endocytic vesicles ) for its activity support this model ( Vassar et al . , 1999 ) . The pathway described above applies to both neuronal and non - neuronal cell types . However , unique to intraneuronal trafficking of APP is its fate to be sorted in both an anterograde and a retrograde manner along axons and dendrites ( Koo et al . , 1990 ; De Strooper et al . , 1995a ; Simons et al . , 1995 ; Yamazaki et al . , 1995 ) . Axonal transport of APP depends on the fast axonal transport system ( Koo et al . , 1990 ) and on the microtubule motor protein kinesin - 1 ( Muresan and Muresan , 2005 ) . Defects in axonal transport of APP , as seen in AD pathology , are likely to aggravate its amyloidogenic processing ( De Vos et al . , 2008 ) . Two peptide sequences in the tail of APP that are important for its basolateral sorting have been identified in polarized Madin Darby canine kidney cells ( a renal cell type ) ( De Strooper et al . , 1995b ; Haass et al . , 1995 ) . Apparently , axonal transport of APP in polarized neurons does not require these basolateral sorting signals , because APP mutants that lack the entire cytoplasmic tail are still sorted normally along axons and dendrites ( Back et al . , 2007 ) . Endocytic receptors modulate the internalization of APP Given the importance of intracellular trafficking for proteolytic processing , many studies have focused on elucidating the mechanisms that control APP transport , not the least because of observations that showed that defects in neuronal trafficking processes might be causative of enhanced amyloidogenic processing in sporadic AD ( Nixon and Cataldo , 2006 ; De Vos et al . , 2008 ) . For instance , the regulation of APP endocytosis is a well - studied process . Apart from substantiating the notion that endocytosis determines the efficiency of amyloidogenic breakdown in the endocytic pathway , these studies raised the awareness that APP depends on co - receptors for the regulation of transport ( Fig . 1B ) . Thus , the efficiency of internalizing APP from the cell surface is modulated through its interaction with an endocytic receptor of the low - density lipoprotein ( LDL ) receptor gene family , the LDL receptor - related protein 1 ( LRP1 ) . This interaction involves the cytoplasmic adaptor protein Fe65 ( also known as APBB1 ) , which simultaneously binds to NPxY motifs in the cytoplasmic tails of APP and LRP1 forming a trimeric complex ( Trommsdorff et al . , 1998 ; Pietrzik et al . , 2004 ) . Interaction of APP with LRP1 at the cell surface accelerates endocytosis of the precursor protein , and enhances A b production in cells ( Ulery et al . , 2000 ; Cam et al . , 2005 ) and in mouse models of AD ( Zerbinatti et al . , 2004 ) . LRP1 - induced internalization of APP is counteracted by apolipoprotein E receptor 2 ( APOER2 , also known as LRP8 ) and LRP1B , two related LRPs that compete with LRP1 for APP binding ( Fig . 1B ) ( Cam et al . , 2004 ; Cam et al . , 2005 ; Hoe et al . , 2005 ; Hoe et al . , 2006 ) . The interaction between APOER2 and APP proceeds both through Fe65 and through an extracellular ligand , F - spondin , which mediates the formation of the complex between the cytoplasmic and extracellular domains of APOER2 and APP ( Hoe et al . , 2005 ; Hoe et al . , 2006 ) . The mode of interaction between LRP1B and APP is unclear at present . Because APOER2 and LRP1B are more slowly endocytosed compared with LRP1 , the association of APP with APOER2 or LRP1B results in its sequestration on the cell surface and a decrease in A b production ( Li et al . , 2001 ; Cam et al . , 2004 ; Hoe et al . , 2005 ; Hoe et al . , 2006 ) . Recently , the Fe65 - mediated interaction between two further receptors of the LDL receptor gene family and APP , namely megalin ( LRP2 ) and the very - low density lipoprotein receptor , has been reported ( Alvira - Botero et al . , 2010 ; Dumanis et al . , 2012 ) . For more in - depth discussions of the implication of LRPs for AD progression , the reader is referred to excellent reviews on this topic ( Bu , 2009 ; Herz , 2009 ; Wagner and Pietrzik , 2012 ) . An alternative process that modulates the endocytosis of APP proceeds at the synapse ; here , membrane turnover , which results from the recycling of synaptic vesicles , is believed to create a membrane shunt that drives the internalization of APP . This mechanism might link the processing of APP to synaptic activity , a process that is of particular relevance for AD ( see Box 2 for details ) ( Selkoe , 2002 ; Westmark , 2013 ) . SORLA , a neuronal trafficking receptor implicated in AD Although the interaction between APP and endocytic receptors for the control of its internalization appeared intuitive , the mechanisms that might sort APP within cells , particularly to and from the TGN , and their relevance for AD - related processes remained enigmatic . The first hint towards answering this question came from an observation by Lah and colleagues who used expression profiling to identify genes that are downregulated in patients suffering from sporadic AD ( Scherzer et al . , 2004 ) . Amongst these genes was the orphan receptor LR11 ( also known as SORL1 ) , or sorting - related receptor with A - type repeats ( hereafter referred to as SORLA ) . SORLA is a 230 kDa type - 1 transmembrane protein ( Jacobsen et al . , 1996 ; Yamazaki et al . , 1996 ) and a member of a family of so - called VPS10 - domain receptors , which are conserved from baker’s yeast to man ( Fig . 2A ) ( Willnow et al . , 2008 ) . The VPS10 domain is derived from a 700 amino acid module found in the extracellular part of all family members , which was initially identified in VPS10 ( the vacuolar protein sorting 10 protein , also known as Pep1 ) , a sorting receptor in yeast . The VPS10 domain forms the site of ligand binding in the yeast receptor that directs lysosomal hydrolases from the TGN to the vacuole ( Marcusson et al . , 1994 ) . Apart from SORLA , four additional VPS10 - domain SORLA controls trafficking of APP 2753 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e receptors are found in vertebrates , designated sortilin ( Petersen et al . , 1997 ) , sortilin - related receptor CNS expressed 1 ( SORCS1 ) ( Hermey et al . , 1999 ) , SORCS2 ( Rezgaoui et al . , 2001 ) and SORCS3 ( Hampe et al . , 2001 ) . All vertebrate receptors are expressed in defined cell populations of the central and peripheral nervous systems , suggesting that there are distinct neuronal functions for the various family members ( Willnow et al . , 2008 ) . Structurally , SORLA is unique amongst these receptors , because its extracellular region contains additional structural modules for protein – protein interactions , which are shared by LRPs ( Fig . 2A ) . In the brain , expression of SORLA is widespread in neurons of the cortex , hippocampus and cerebellum ( Motoi et al . , 1999 ) . At the subcellular level , SORLA is predominantly found in early endosomes and in the TGN ( Jacobsen et al . , 2001 ; Offe et al . , 2006 ) . Receptors at the plasma membrane ( , 10 % of the total receptor mass ) exhibit rapid internalization that is mediated by an acidic - cluster - dileucine site in the cytoplasmic tail of SORLA , which binds to AP2 ( Jacobsen et al . , 2001 ; Nielsen et al . , 2007 ) ( Fig . 2B ) . From early endosomes , SORLA moves retrogradely to the TGN and , thereafter , continues to shuttle between TGN and early endosomes ( Nielsen et al . , 2007 ; Schmidt et al . , 2007 ) ( Fig . 2B ) . This distinct trafficking behaviour sets SORLA apart from other prototypic clearance receptors , such as the LDL receptor or LRP1 , which typically recycle from early endosomes back to the cell surface . Retrograde targeting of SORLA to the TGN is guided by sorting motifs in the cytosolic receptor domain , as shown by the loss of TGN localization in receptor mutants lacking the tail domain ( Nielsen et al . , 2007 ; Schmidt et al . , 2007 ) . Similar sorting paths have been described for sortilin ( Jacobsen et al . , 2001 ; Nielsen et al . , 2001 ; Morinville et al . , 2004 ) and SORCS1 ( Nielsen et al . , 2008 ) . A number of ligands interact with the extracellular region of SORLA , including apolipoprotein E ( Taira et al . , 2001 ) , lipoprotein lipase ( Jacobsen et al . , 2001 ; Klinger et al . , 2011 ) , glia cell line - derived neurotrophic factor ( Westergaard et al . , 2004 ) and platelet - derived growth factor ( Gliemann et al . , 2004 ) . However , it was unclear whether any of these ligands represent the physiological targets of SORLA - dependent uptake and / or intracellular sorting in neurons . Although the role of SORLA in neurons initially remained enigmatic , evidence from pathophysiological and genetic studies implicated this presumed trafficking receptor in AD - related processes . For instance , reduced levels of SORLA in cortex and hippocampus , but not in cerebellum ( a tissue that is not affected by AD pathology ) , have been previously noted in autopsy material from AD patients ( Scherzer et al . , 2004 ) . Subsequent studies also documented poor receptor expression in individuals with mild cognitive impairment ( Sager et al . , 2007 ) . Furthermore , decreased levels of the shedded SORLA ectodomain were observed in the cerebrospinal fluid of AD patients ( Ma et al . , 2009 ) . The pathophysiological significance of the soluble SORLA ectodomain is unclear at present ( Fig . 2B ) . However , it is considered as a biomarker that is indicative for the levels of the intact receptor expressed in the brain parenchyma . In contrast to some cases of sporadic AD , expression of SORLA is normal in individuals suffering from FAD ( Dodson et al . , 2006 ) . Thus , loss of this receptor is not just a secondary consequence of neurodegenerative processes . Rather , poor expression of SORLA seen in non - familial AD probably constitutes a primary cause of the sporadic form of this disease . Most studies on brain or cerebrospinal fluid specimens reported an , 20 – 50 % decrease in the levels of SORLA in the brain of some individuals with sporadic AD ( Scherzer et al . , 2004 ; Andersen et al . , 2005 ; Dodson et al . , 2006 ; Sager et al . , 2007 ; Zhao et al . , 2007 ) . A recent study failed to recapitulate the reduced expression of SORLA in yet another set of post - mortem AD brain samples ( Sager et al . , 2012 ) , and , therefore , additional studies might be necessary to resolve this issue . Nevertheless , there is strong support for the involvement of SORLA in sporadic AD , which stems from population - based studies that document association of genetic variants of SORL1 ( the gene encoding SORLA ) with sporadic AD in several ethnicities ( Rogaeva et al . , 2007 ; Bettens et al . , 2008 ; Cuenco et al . , 2008 ; Lee et al . , 2008 ; Webster et al . , 2008 ) . Cumulative meta - analyses encompassing in excess of 30 , 000 individuals ( Reitz et al . , 2011 ) and genome - wide association studies ( Meng et al . , 2007 ; Naj et al . , 2011 ) confirm the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in SORL1 with AD . SORLA controls APP trafficking and processing A breakthrough in understanding the involvement of SORLA in AD came when we and our collaborators found that SORLA is able to bind to APP , and to affect its trafficking and processing in cultured cells and in the mouse brain in vivo cells ( Andersen et al . , 2005 ) . Because overexpression of SORLA in reduced the production of A b , whereas loss of SORLA expression in mice increased it , the receptor was perceived as a factor protecting against AD – a hypothesis that is in line with the reduced levels Box 2 . Synaptic activity - dependent trafficking and processing of APP Oligomeric forms of A b impair synaptic plasticity by inducing the internalization of glutamate receptors from the synaptic plasma membrane ( Snyder et al . , 2005 ; Hsieh et al . , 2006 ) . This observation suggests a physiological role for A b as a modulator of synaptic activity and that aberrant suppression of synaptic transmission is caused by excessive A b production in the diseased brain . In support of this model , synaptic activity is an important driving force for A b production , both in hippocampal slice cultures ( Kamenetz et al . , 2003 ) and in the brain in vivo ( Cirrito et al . , 2005 ; Cirrito et al . , 2008 ) , apparently providing a negative - feedback loop for synaptic activity . The following model has been proposed to explain a link between synaptic activity and A b production : docking and recycling of the membranes of synaptic vesicles at the pre - synapse creates a membrane flow that shunts APP molecules from the surface of synaptic termini into endosomes , thereby inducing production of A b ( see figure ) ( Cirrito et al . , 2008 ) .

Subsequently , we showed that SORLA interacts with APP through its cluster of complement - type repeats and forms a 1 : 1 stoichiometric complex with the carbohydrate - linked domain of APP ( Andersen et al . , 2005 ; Andersen et al . , 2006 ) . Binding to SORLA blocks both the amyloidogenic and non - amyloidogenic processing of APP ( Andersen et al . , 2005 ; Offe et al . , 2006 ; Rogaeva et al . , 2007 ; Schmidt et al . , 2007 ) . These observations from established cell lines and primary neurons were corroborated in SORLA - deficient mouse models , and demonstrated an enhanced processing of murine APP ( Andersen et al . , 2005 ) and of transgenic human APP variants in the absence of SORLA ( Dodson et al . , 2008 ; Rohe et al . , 2008 ) . Two main hypotheses have been proposed for how the interaction with SORLA affects APP processing . These hypotheses are on the basis of findings that the main interaction of APP with SORLA occurs in the TGN and affects the initial cleavage of APP by either a - or b - secretases ( Schmidt et al . , 2007 ; Schmidt et al . , 2012 ) . In addition , SORLA has been shown to not directly inhibit secretase activities , but instead exerts its inhibitory effects through binding of their substrate APP ( Schmidt et al . , 2012 ) . The first hypothesis assumes that SORLA functions as a TGN retention factor for APP ( Fig . 3A ) . In this model , the interaction with SORLA blocks the ability of APP to form homodimers , which are the preferred substrates of secretase ( Schmidt et al . , 2012 ) . In addition , binding to SORLA results in the sequestration of APP in the TGN , probably as a result of the slower vesicular trafficking kinetics of SORLA compared with APP . The impaired trafficking of APP to the cell surface effectively reduces the extent of non - amyloidogenic and amyloidogenic processing at the plasma membrane and in endosomes , respectively ( Andersen et al . , 2005 ; Offe et al . , 2006 ; Schmidt et al . , 2007 ) . The ability of SORLA to block the export of APP from the TGN has been shown in several experimental systems , including live - cell imaging ( Schmidt et al . , 2007 ) . Retention mechanisms have been identified for Golgi - resident glycosyltransferases based on the presence of short - peptide motifs in their cytoplasmic domains ( Tu and Banfield , 2010 ) . However , whether the retention of SORLA by the TGN operates through a similar mechanism is unknown . Alternatively , the interaction between APP and SORLA might impair its post - translational modifications or dimer formation , processes that are potentially necessary for efficient exit of APP from the TGN .

Structural organization and trafficking path of SORLA . ( A ) SORLA is a member of the VPS10 - domain receptor family , a group of sorting receptors characterized by a VPS10 domain . This domain adopts the structure of a large tunnel that is involved in binding of peptide ligands ( Quistgaard et al . , 2009 ) . In contrast to all other VPS10 - domain receptors , SORLA also harbors complement - type repeats and a b - propeller , structural elements that are found in LRPs . The cluster of complement - type repeats is also a site that interacts with ligands . The b - propeller is required for pH - dependent release of ligands in endosomes . SORLA is produced in the cell as a pro - receptor with a 53 amino acid pro - peptide that folds back on the VPS10 domain to block binding of ligands that target this receptor domain . Cleavage of the pro - peptide by convertases in the TGN produces the mature receptor , which is able to interact with its target proteins ( Jacobsen et al . , 2001 ) . All known members of the VPS10 - domain receptor family are shown to include the yeast receptor VPS10 and the vertebrate proteins sortilin , SORLA , as well as SORCS1 , SORCS2 and SORCS3 . For LRPs , the only receptors depicted are those that have been shown to interact with APP ( reviewed in Bu , 2009 ; Wagner and Pietrzik , 2012 ) . ( B ) Newly synthesized pro - SORLA is activated in the Golgi by convertase cleavage . From the TGN , nascent SORLA is directed to the plasma membrane through constitutive secretory vesicles . At the cell surface , some receptor molecules are subject to ectodomain shedding and subsequent intramembrane proteolysis by c - secretase ( c ) , resulting in soluble fragments of the extracellular domain and the intracellular tail . Most SORLA molecules at the cell surface remain intact and undergo clathrin - mediated endocytosis . From the early endosomes , internalized receptors ( and probably some of their cargo ) are returned to the TGN to continue anterograde and retrograde shuttling between the secretory and early endosomal compartments . SORLA controls trafficking of APP 2755 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e The second model , showing the impact of SORLA on APP processing , suggests that it functions as an intracellular sorting receptor that guides APP between secretory and endocytic organelles ( Fig . 3B ) . This model is supported by a number of studies that found that the molecular interactions of SORLA with cytosolic adaptors are essential for its intracellular routing . Four distinct groups of cargo adaptor complexes , termed AP1 , PACS1 , GGA and retromer , mediate the shuttling of SORLA between TGN and endosomes by targeting specific motifs in its cytoplasmic domain . AP1 , an AP2 - related tetrameric complex , interacts with an acidic motif D 2190 DLGEDDED ( numbers refer to the human SORLA sequence ; Q92673 , Uniprot ) ( Nielsen et al . , 2007 ) . AP1 links cargo to the clathrin coat of endosomal and TGN vesicles . This acidic motif in the tail of SORLA is also bound by phosphofurin acidic cluster sorting protein 1 ( PACS1 ) ( Schmidt et al . , 2007 ) , which mediates retrograde as well as anterograde Golgi - to - endosome transport ( Scott et al . , 2006 ) . The monomeric clathrin adaptors GGA1 , GGA2 and GGA3 ( Golgi - localizing , c - adaptin ear homology domain , ARF - interacting proteins 1 to 3 ) bind to the D 2207 DVPMVIA element in the tail of SORLA ( Jacobsen et al . , 2002 ; Schmidt et al . , 2007 ; P . Madsen , personal communication , Aarhus University , Aarhus , Denmark ) , and the VPS26 subunit of the retromer complex , which is part of the vesicle coat , targets the F 2172 ANSHY motif ( Seaman , 2004 ; Seaman , 2007 ; Fjorback et al . , 2012 ) . Adaptor interactions have proved to be crucial for SORLA - dependent sorting and processing of APP , because deletion of adaptor binding sites in the tail of SORLA caused the inability of the receptor to be sorted to the TGN and , consequently , resulted in aberrant routing and enhanced processing of APP ( Nielsen et al . , 2007 ; Schmidt et al . , 2007 ; Fjorback et al . , 2012 ; Herskowitz et al . , 2012 ) . Taken together , the available data support a model in which AP1 and the GGA proteins traffic SORLA from the Golgi to endosomes , whereas retromer is responsible for returning it from the early endosomes to the TGN . PACS1 might mediate the sorting of SORLA in either direction ( Fig . 3B ) . If amyloidogenic processing does indeed occur in endosomes , which is generally believed to be the case , the retrograde sorting of APP by SORLA should protect against the accumulation of A b – an assumption that is in line with most of the data from cell lines and mouse models . However , some recent studies argue that b - secretase cleavage takes place in the TGN , and therefore , SORLA - dependent retrograde sorting of APP would deliver the precursor to compartments that facilitate amyloidogenic breakdown ( Burgos et al . , 2010 ; Choy et al . , 2012 ) . Because binding to SORLA inhibits the dimerization of APP ( Schmidt et al . , 2012 ) and impairs the access of b - secretase to its substrate ( Spoelgen et al . , 2006 ) , SORLA might still act as an anti - amyloidogenic factor in the latter model . Obviously , the proposed functions for SORLA as a retention factor or a sorting receptor are not mutually exclusive , and additional studies are required to elucidate the exact molecular roles of this receptor . Recently , similar functions in the trafficking of APP and of b - secretase have been suggested for sortilin and SORCS1 , but the underlying mechanisms warrant further clarification ( Lane et al . , 2010b ; Finan et al . , 2011 ; Gustafsen et al . , 2013 ; Lane et al . , 2013 ) . In addition to interactions with cytosolic adaptors , post - translational modifications might also modulate the ability of SORLA to bind to and sort APP . It is known that SORLA can undergo ectodomain shedding and regulated intramembrane proteolysis ( Hampe et al . , 2000 ; Hermey et al . , 2006 ; Nyborg et al . , 2006 ) . Proteolysis abrogates the ability of SORLA to act as sorting factor , but results in a soluble intracellular receptor domain that might function as a transcriptional regulator in the nucleus ( Bo¨hm et al . , 2006 ) ( Fig . 2B ) . In addition , SORLA is phosphorylated by protein kinase C and ROCK2 ( rho - activated coiled - coil kinase 2 ) ( Lane et al . , 2010a ; Herskowitz et al . , 2011 ) , enzymes that have previously been implicated in amyloidogenic processing , because inhibition of the activity of these kinases by knockdown or pharmacological intervention increased the production of A b ( Zhou et al . , 2003 ; Leuchtenberger et al . , 2006 ) . Reducing ROCK2 activity impairs the trafficking of SORLA and decreases ectodomain shedding of the receptor ( Herskowitz et al . , 2012 ) .

Two models for SORLA - dependent sorting and processing of APP . ( A ) SORLA acts as a TGN retention factor for APP . The interaction between SORLA and APP in the TGN prevents the formation of APP homodimers , the preferred secretase substrate . In addition , it blocks the exit of APP to the cell surface , reducing the extent of amyloidogenic and non - amyloidogenic processing in post - Golgi compartments . ( B ) SORLA acts as sorting receptor for APP . In this model , SORLA shuttles between the TGN and early endosomes , guided by the interaction with AP1 and GGA for anterograde , and with retromer for retrograde sorting . PACS1 might work in either direction . SORLA - dependent retrograde sorting of APP reduces the number of APP molecules that are subjected to amyloidogenic processing in early and late endosomes . Journal of Cell Science 126 ( 13 ) 2756 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e primarily occurs at serine - 2206 , a residue found in close proximity to the GGA - binding site in the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor ( Herskowitz et al . , 2012 ) . A sixfold increase in GGA binding to SORLA upon phosphorylation of serine - 2206 has been reported ( Cramer et al . , 2010 ) . Conceptually , phosphorylation of SORLA might represent a way in which to regulate receptor interaction with GGA and control anterograde sorting ( Fig . 2B ) , thereby providing a mechanistic explanation for how ROCK2 activity influences A b levels . Loss of SORLA activity might underlie sporadic AD Given all the evidence that implicates SORLA in the cellular processing of APP , an important question concerns the genetic and pathophysiological mechanisms that predispose individuals to low receptor activity and , hence , to increased amyloidogenic processing that is causative of sporadic AD . Because gene expression profiling in lymphoblasts has uncovered 60 % less SORL1 transcripts in AD patients compared with controls , it has been proposed that sequence variations in SORL1 might affect transcript levels ( Scherzer et al . , 2004 ) . In accordance with this assumption , Grear and colleagues found a correlation between lower levels of SORL1 mRNA and the presence of a SNP in the 5 9 intronic region of the gene in cases of AD ( Grear et al . , 2009 ) . Recently , we identified the presence of two closely linked SNPs in the 3 9 region of SORL1 , which correlate with low expression of the receptor in the diseased brain . These gene variations alter the sequence of the SORL1 transcript , and result in a change from a frequent to a rare codon usage in the SNP genotype . Further studies in cultured cells confirmed that these SNP - containing transcripts are less efficiently translated into protein and result in a 30 % reduction in SORLA protein levels , which is similar to the reduction seen in AD patients ( Caglayan et al . , 2012 ) . However , regression analyses suggested that sequence variations only account for as little as 14 % of variations in SORL1 mRNA levels , and therefore indicate that additional genetic or non - genetic factors modulate SORL1 expression in the brain ( Rogaeva et al . , 2007 ) . One such factor is docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) , an essential dietary v - 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid that has been implicated in AD , because low blood levels of DHA have been associated with an increased risk of neurodegeneration in a large epidemiological study ( Johnson and Schaefer , 2006 ) . DHA was shown to markedly upregulate expression of SORLA in primary neurons and in mouse models , arguing that the increased disease risk when DHA levels are low might be explained by defects in induction of SORL1 transcription ( Ma et al . , 2007 ) . Another protein that modulates SORLA levels in the brain is brain - derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) , a growth factor that provides trophic support to neurons ( Chao , 2003 ) . BDNF potently activates transcription of the SORL1 gene by more than tenfold through the extracellular - signal - regulated kinase ( ERK ) pathway and yet unknown downstream transcription factors ( Rohe et al . , 2009 ) . It is possible that a poor trophic support to neurons , as shown in chronic insults to the nervous system , is deleterious through the associated loss of SORL1 expression ( Matrone et al . , 2008 ; Rohe et al . , 2009 ) . Because SORLA and its interacting adaptors have a pivotal role in the trafficking of APP , it comes as no surprise that additional components of this trafficking machinery emerge as genetic risk factors in AD . Foremost , this applies to the pentameric retromer complex , which is composed of VPS35 , VPS29 , VPS26 and the sorting nexins 1 and 2 ( reviewed in Seaman , 2012 ) . VPS35 and VPS26 are poorly expressed in the brain of AD patients ( Small et al . , 2005 ) , and disruption of Vps35 in mice results in memory deficits and synaptic dysfunction , which are associated with elevated A b levels ( Muhammad et al . , 2008 ) . As retrograde transport of SORLA , which is mediated by retromer , is important for processing of APP ( Fjorback et al . , 2012 ) , impaired retromer function , might be an underlying cause of neurodegenerative processes ( Nothwehr et al . , 2000 ) . In a similar manner , decreased levels of GGA3 are observed in brain autopsies of AD patients ( Santosa et al . , 2011 ) . Moreover , the loss of GGA3 expression enhances b - secretase activity ( Tesco et al . , 2007 ) , suggesting that impaired anterograde transport of SORLA is an additional cause of neuronal dysfunction . Conclusions Recent years witnessed the detailed elucidation of cellular trafficking pathways that control APP processing , and how they contribute to neurodegenerative processes in patients . In particular , the functional characterization of SORLA , a unique sorting receptor for APP , sheds light on the targeted transport of APP to distinct neuronal compartments that harbour the various secretase activities – a process that was previously poorly understood . Results from histopathological and epidemiological studies further substantiate the crucial role of this receptor in sporadic AD . Equally exciting is a recent report that mutations in SORL1 might even be the cause of autosomal dominant forms of early - onset AD ( Pottier et al . , 2012 ) . Here , five missense mutations , one of which maps to the APP binding domain in SORLA , have been identified in familial cases of AD . Although much still needs to be learned about this sorting pathway , it certainly holds great promise as a genetic risk factor and new biomarker for diagnosis , and perhaps it might even constitute a druggable target for the treatment of AD .
