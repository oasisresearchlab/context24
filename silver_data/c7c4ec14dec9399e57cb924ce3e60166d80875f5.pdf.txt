CT uses computer processing and creates cross - sectional image slices of the bones , tissues , and blood vessels at the target area of the body [ 4 ] . Due to its merit and three - dimensional view opportunity of the lung , CT is widely preferred for the discovery of COVID - 19 infection as typical signs of the disease could be observed by CT slices [ 5 ] . The CT images of patients with COVID - 19 have di ff erent characteristics and provide information for the experts in diagnosing the disease and evaluating the severity of the patient’s condition [ 6 ] . However , the automatic segmentation of the lesions is a challenging task due to the irregular shapes and low - contrast or indistinct occurrences of infected regions . AI has been used in every medical field [ 7 , 8 ] and has again played a vital role in diagnosing and treating COVID - 19 . Since the beginning of the pandemic , AI was used to recognize patterns on CT images to find and trace the exis - tence of the infection in lungs [ 9 ] . In particular , recent advances and improvements in Deep Learning ( DL ) technology provides an opportunity of analyzing medical images with higher accuracy [ 10 ] . U - Net is a CNN - based architecture that consists of two paths and is designed for image segmentation . The con - tracting path is known as the encoder or analysis path and provides classification information . The expansion path is a decoder or synthesis path and allows the network to learn localized classification information while increasing the resolution of the output [ 11 ] . It has been widely used in recent research and modified for further studies [ 12 ] . In 2020 , M¨uller et al . [ 13 ] , implemented a 3D U - Net architecture with 5 - fold cross - validation on CT scans of 20 COVID - 19 patients to develop high accuracy and robust segmentation model for lungs . Researchers could handle Dice similarity coe ffi cients of 0 . 761 for infection . In addition , in 2020 , Yan et al . [ 14 ] considered a more comprehensive dataset ( 21 , 658 chest CT images of 861 COVID - 19 patients ) . In the proposed Depp CNN , the authors introduced a novel block , feature variation , that regulates the global properties of the features to segment COVID - 19 infection . Di ff erent features were used for di ff erent scales with Progressive Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling . As a result of experiments , Dice similarity coe ffi cients for COVID - 19 infected lung images were stated as 0 . 726 . In 2021 , Zhou et al . [ 15 ] applied a U - Net - based segmentation network using an attention mechanism that includes spatial attention and channel attention modules on chest CT images of 473 patients with confirmed COVID - 19 infec - tion . The applied method could obtain a 0 . 831 Dice score . In the same year , Zheng et al . [ 6 ] proposed a 3D CU - Net attention mechanism . In the proposed model , the authors designed a pyramid fusion module and the results of per - formed experiments showed 0 . 778 Dice similarity coe ffi cients for the infected lung . Again in 2021 , Bressem et al . applied U - Net architecture on a dataset that includes 120 chest CTs of 110 COVID - 19 patients . The proposed model achieved a Dice score of 0 . 679 on the target dataset with a shorter training time , and less memory available on a single GPU [ 16 ] . Recently in 2022 , Enshaei et al . [ 17 ] conducted a study that included 433 chest 2D CT images from 82 patients to automatically segment lung abnormalities related to COVID - 19 . The authors evaluated the proposed Deep Neural Network ( DNN ) performance by performing several experiments using the introduced and external datasets . The results showed a dice score of 0 . 8069 . In 2022 , Zhang et al . [ 18 ] considered 100 lung CT images of 40 patients . In the research , multi - scale and multilevel features were utilized to segment di ff erent scales lesions and lesion boundaries . The proposed MSDC - Net aimed to ease the scale di ff erence and low - contrast problems between lesions and normal tissues . A 0 . 824 Dice score was achieved in this study . Based on the abovementioned information , this paper aims to apply histogram - based non - parametric region lo - calization and enhancement ( LE ) methods prior to the deep learning architecture U - Net to provide distinct and more distinguishable regions to the U - Net model . The COVID - 19 - infected lung CT images were initially processed by the LE methods to the Lung CT images of COVID - 19 patients , and the visual appearance of the lesions and abnormal regions were improved . Then , the infected regions were segmented using the U - Net model with the resultant images of the LE method .

Dataset The original version of the dataset considered in this study belongs to a collection of the Italian Society of Medical and Interventional Radiology [ 19 ] . It contains 100 axial lung CT images with a resolution of 512 × 512 . Masks of the lung regions are prepared , which is based on [ 20 ] to be able to make the images more suitable for processing and o ff ered in the dataset source [ 19 ] . The experiment in this study is performed using 256 × 256 segmented lung images released by [ 21 ] . Figure 1 shows a sample of the original and segmented lung images . 2 . 2 . Lung CT Segmentation System The proposed system aims to increase the visual discriminative features of COVID - 19 pneumonia regions in CT images using the localization and enhancement methods described in [ 22 ] and increase the U - Net model’s segmenta - tion ability [ 11 ] . The localization and enhancement ( LE ) methods were initially proposed to localize the brain tumors and apply the enhancement to the detected regions . However , the methods are capable of detecting abnormalities in medical images that point to the formation of healthy tissues prior to further processing . The primary goal of the LE method was defined as detecting both high and low - contrast occurrences within the images and providing explicitly enhanced images for the segmentation tasks . The code of the LE method is available at https : / / github . com / ailhan - NEU / LE _ Method The LE method are two phases completing a single method based on the image histogram where the zero intensity values are eliminated . The mean of intensity frequencies ( θ fr ) was used as the initial threshold value prior to the determination of the background and abnormal regions , as shown in Equation 1 . B min = min ( I θ fr ) and T min = max ( I θ fr ) ( 1 ) where I θ fr is the intensity values and the θ fr is the mean of intensity frequencies . The final localization of the regions was based on the standard deviations ( S td ) of the initial regions . The region assigned as background ( B ) if S td B > S td T , and assigned as abnormal region if S td B < S td T . The final enhancement was described as the pixel - wise addition of two images , as shown in Equation 2 : O R = I f + O i ( 2 ) 4 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 ( 2023 ) 000 – 000 Fig . 2 .

Experimental Design and Evaluation The experiment in this study is performed using the k - fold cross - validation method , where the k value is determined as 5 . The use of 5 - fold cross - validation in the experiments provided a more accurate evaluation of the segmentation ability of the system . Each fold contains randomly selected 80 training and 20 testing images . The data augmentation was not applied to the images to show the e ffi ciency of the localization and enhancement methods with a small number of input data . The training parameters of the U - Net were determined as 0 . 0001 and 8 for the learning rate and the mini - batch size . The U - Net model was trained for 100 epochs for each fold . The performance of the proposed system was evaluated using six metrics : Dice score , Jaccard index , accuracy , precision , sensitivity and specificity . The mean of each metric is considered as the final evaluation result . The configuration of the computer used to perform the experiment is 32 GB RAM , NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 graphics processor , and i7 - 8th generation CPU . 3 .

General block diagram of the proposed Lung - CT segmentation system . where I f denotes the filtered image and O i was defined as : O T = I T ( x , y ) − T min S td T ( 3 ) O B = I T ( x , y ) − T U min S td T U ( 4 ) Figure 2 and Figure 3 show the general block diagram of the Lung - CT segmentation systems and example images localized and enhanced by the LE method , respectively . 2 . 3 . Experimental Design and Evaluation The experiment in this study is performed using the k - fold cross - validation method , where the k value is determined as 5 . The use of 5 - fold cross - validation in the experiments provided a more accurate evaluation of the segmentation ability of the system . Each fold contains randomly selected 80 training and 20 testing images . The data augmentation was not applied to the images to show the e ffi ciency of the localization and enhancement methods with a small number of input data . The training parameters of the U - Net were determined as 0 . 0001 and 8 for the learning rate and the mini - batch size . The U - Net model was trained for 100 epochs for each fold . The performance of the proposed system was evaluated using six metrics : Dice score , Jaccard index , accuracy , precision , sensitivity and specificity . The mean of each metric is considered as the final evaluation result . The configuration of the computer used to perform the experiment is 32 GB RAM , NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 graphics processor , and i7 - 8th generation CPU . 3 .

The other limitation is the consideration of a limited number of images . These limitations might a ff ect the segmen - tation performance of the system . 4 . Conclusion Segmenting the infected or abnormal regions in CT lung images is vital for early and further diagnosis of diseases . Therefore , an e ff ective and fast segmentation process is required to achieve this purpose . This study proposes a COVID - 19 lung CT segmentation system based on the combination of Localization and Enhancement methods prior to the U - Net architecture . The system applied automatic non - parametric histogram - based abnormal region localization and enhancement process to provide more informative regions for the U - net to improve the model’s segmentation ability . Implementation of the LE method on the abnormal regions provided the feature learning more e ffi ciently by the deep structures without requiring any data augmentation techniques and architecture modifications . The experiments were performed using 5 - fold cross - validation , and the proposed COVID - 19 segmentation system obtained superior results to the comparative studies by achieving a 0 . 85 dice score on the considered dataset . In future work , it is planned to propose a more comprehensive system by considering the pneumonia data in addition to the COVID - 19 dataset .
