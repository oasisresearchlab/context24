The sun is the most widely available source of NRE as its energy is so abundant and not restricted to a single dominating country , unlike fossil fuel sources such as oil and coal . In Indonesia solar power plants ( SPP ) , also known as PLTS , is a growing opportunity as well as an increasing challenge for various stakeholders . The main question is how to grab and convey information on the development of rooftops SPP worldwide to boost their interest in the use of SPP . The purpose of this study is to gather and provide meaningful information in the form of Map Visualization of the distribution of rooftops SPP that have been installed throughout the world , ranked from the level of continents , countries , cities , down to the location . In particular , an interactive map visualization with drilldown ( zoom in ) and rollup ( zoom out ) capabilities to enable users to reveal interesting hidden information on global maps with pop - up details . Data processing , analysis and presentation involve data extraction , cleansing , transformation , exploration , and map visualization with folium , as well as additional map visualization using Google Earth Pro . Disclosure of key findings visually improve the quality of information delivery for ease of comparison and evaluation . In conclusion it is proven that the objective of providing map visualization with interactive zoom in and zoom out to drilldown and rollup for revealing relevant finding in the form of pop - up windows at selected points is achieved . Keywords— solarmanpv , dataset extraction , dataset visualization I . I NTRODUCTION Indonesia has been in the era of NRE ( New Renewable Energy ) where the production of electrical energy in many power plants has utilized many NRE sources [ 1 ] 2 [ ] . The use of NRE , especially solar energy , is virtually unlimited by geographic locations because almost the entire surface of the earth , both land and water , is illuminated by the sun with a relatively long span of time from 6 am to 6 pm . The penetration of solar power plants into the electric power system now and in the future will provide several opportunities as well as challenges [ 3 ] [ 4 ] to various stakeholders , both to the community as a prosumer , the government as a regulator , to the state Power Grid Company as the owner of the Indonesian electric power system . Key stakeholders here are namely the rooftop SPP community as a prosumer , PLN ( Perusahaan Listrik Negara or Indonesian Power Grid Company ) as a single provider of state electricity networks , and the government as a regulator . To find out how advanced and how widespread the distribution of PLTS throughout the world , data is needed that can be pulled from various sources that provide actual data on the PLTS . The birth of the digital platform and the power Internet of Things ( IoT ) has made the existent of IoT platform service providers [ 5 ] [ 6 ] for hosting PLTS data the right choice , because the author has used a similar platform since 2016 , and has access to very detailed private data , as well as public data that only contains more generic data related to each PLTS whose data is connected to this IoT platform . The access to global collection of PLTS information currently can be obtained through various digital platform providers . SolarmanPV is an example of an IoT data storage service provider for rooftop solar owners from all over the world who subscribe to a solar logging platform based in Huishan District , Jiangsu , China . More background on the SolarmanPV data source itself , interestingly it captures information automatally sent by Wi - Fi based IoT attached customers’ solar PV inverters that whose ID number was registered at the first time of installation . It is basically crowd contributions into the IoT platform . Depending on the customers’ preference , the type of solar PV data and interval of transmission to the cloud storage severs can be configured from 5 minutes or longer time . The authors have used this service from 2016 during first installation of a rooftop solar PV at home , and until now . Data can be made public or private . This is the source of our dataset Starting with data extraction from the service provider ' s website , the raw data is collected in a storage medium on a local computer . Furthermore , data cleansing and transformation of collected data from extracted sources can be divided into two qualitative steps , namely error detection and error correction . Error detection mechanisms look for information and hidden data , then categorize the data in valid status or invalid status . Steps in detecting errors in rows and columns in the data sets are carried out programmatically with the use of the python anaconda program , and followed by the error repair and data cleansing phases . These are the general process of data extraction and cleansing as part of data engineering and data science [ 7 ] . Data quality is critical to the success of any data analysis project in a data driven society and Digital Economy [ 8 ] , as the results of the analysis will largely depend on the quality of the initial data fed into the system as well as its detailed processes . Errors are often encountered in the data collection 979 - 8 - 3503 - 8291 - 4 / 23 / $ 31 . 00 ©2023 IEEE 2023 International Workshop on Artificial Intelligence and Image Processing ( IWAIIP ) 51 2023 I n t e r n a ti on a l W o r k s hop on A r ti f i c i a l I n t e lli g e n ce a nd I m a g e P r o ce ss i ng ( I W A II P ) | 979 - 8 - 3503 - 8291 - 4 / 23 / $ 31 . 00 © 2023 I EEE | DO I : 10 . 1109 / I W A II P 58158 . 2023 . 10462816 Authorized licensed use limited to the terms of the applicable license agreement with IEEE .

Data errors during the collection process range from relatively common errors such as duplicate values , incorrect data types , placement errors that may be relatively easy to resolve . More complex errors such as missing values or data in unknown formats can also occur . In short , the approach used to clean data that has been collected generally goes through two phases , namely the error detection phase and the error correction phase . Once the data is cleaned , it is ready for analysis . Data analysis is the process of taking cleaned data and turning it into more structured and more appropriate information for decision - making by its users [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] . Specifically , once data is collected , cleaned , analyzed and displayed in the most appropriate format , answering questions , testing hypotheses , or refuting theories can be carried out . It is worth to mention that the specific objectives are to explore the global distribution of solar PV through data source extraction , cleansing , visualization and conclusion . This will guide the process into the findings . II . R ESEARCH M ETHODS This research was overall conducted through five stages of experimentation , as can be seen in Figure 1 . More details on the specific data cleansing steps and algorithms used are directly elaborated in section III Results , specifically in the implementation A , B , C , D and E to eliminate redundancy and intimate the readers with the actual progression . Fig . 1 . Five Stages of Experimentation The initial stage is the determination of the purpose of the analysis , namely to have a systematic mapping and visualization of global PLTS distribution quantitatively . The second stage is data retrieval sourced from the SolarmanPV website which has the web address : www . solarmanpv . com / portal / for read - only IoT data repository . The reference data source was selected and first work was carried out to extract PLTS data worldwide from this SolarmanPV website . SolarmanPV is one of the major IoT platforms where PLTS owners can register their IoT and store their PLTS data there . From the available raw data there are 15 , 562 rows ( lists ) and 17 columns ( attributes ) for analysis , as shown in Figure 2 , where each row represents one site of PLTS presumably . The third stage is data processing . The purpose of data processing is to prepare data to be ready for analysis . Data processing is done by using anaconda python software , especially the Jupyter Notebook application with python programming language for ease of quick checking . At this stage , data are examined carefully to decide how to best handle the existing data . Here , the key steps include algorithms for data cleansing , error detection and producing quality data for better further analysis . In beginning of this stage , column names and sample values , such as shown in Figure 2 , are further visually inspected and some basic statistical analyses are performed on the number of rows of data . All column names are critically seen as a whole in relation to the actual properties of solar PV power plants using logic and common sense as experienced by the authors [ 2 ] . In this way , some columns can be ignored , while other columns need to be created as needed . Fig . 2 . List of Columns Used and Sample Values The fourth stage is the detailed exploratory data analysis . At this stage , visual presentation of data is still carried out using the Jupyter Notebook application with the Python programming language . Various attributes relevant to the purpose of analysis are explored visually by using the folium library to create maps to derive patterns or anomalies from data . The final stage is the drawing of conclusions . At this stage , the findings of patterns or anomalies obtained in the previous stages are concluded . III . R ESULTS AND D ISCUSSIONS The authors apply a data cleaning system to the dataset and to map visualization by using python 3 . 9 language and libraries for data science , specifically : 1 . Pandas library for storing and processing relational data [ 12 ] [ 13 ] . 2 . NumPy library for performing scientific computational operations on arrays [ 14 ] , 15 ] 3 . Folium library for visualizing data on interactive maps , with built - in tilesets from OpenStreet , Mapbox , and Stamen [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] . 4 . Geopy library [ 19 ] for processing several GEO APIs , such as google , openstreet , baidu , ArcGis 5 . ArcGis library for geo - coding and processing . 6 . MarkerCluster library [ 20 ] for displaying a large number of markers on the map . 7 . The Jupiter notebook environment [ 21 ] for building interactive user interfaces . Before any implementation of data processing can take place , data engineering , data gathering and raw dataset creation must be completed first [ 22 ] . Once raw data set is collected , the next step of the overall data processing and final insightful map visualization can be initiated . 2023 International Workshop on Artificial Intelligence and Image Processing ( IWAIIP ) 52 Authorized licensed use limited to the terms of the applicable license agreement with IEEE .

Implementation of Invalid Attribute Column Drop / Remove Algorithm Based on the data structure in Figure 2 , two attributes " Status " and " Your own SIM card " , are of no interest in whatever patterns they have , so they are cleansed using a drop algorithm . The flow of steps to delete attribute columns and to rename is shown in Figure 3 Algorithm Drop & Rename , and the data delete or drop snippet is shown in Figure 4 , Furthermore , the authors rename columns by arranging attribute names so that the attribute column matches the information in the data . The algorithm is shown in Figure 5 and the results of the drop and rename algorithm are shown in Figure 6 . Fig . 3 . Algorithm Drop and Rename Fig . 4 . Drop Algorithm Fig . 5 . Rename Algorithm Fig . 6 . Drop and Rename Algorithm Results B . Implementation of Data Cleaning Merge Item Algorithm Groups data items combined by adding attributes to as new column using the merge join algorithm . Due to the large amount of data contained in SolarmanPV original raw dataset totaling of 15 , 562 records , several columns are grouped logically . For example , the state attribute is grouped into continent attribute , while the inverter type panel attribute is grouped into the same item type for summarization . The steps of merge join are shown in Figure 7 , the snippet can be seen in Figure 8 , and the results are shown in Figure 9 . As mentioned in the third stage of the research methods , data processing is performed , where some old some columns can be ignored or dropped , while other columns need to be created as needed , as can be compared between Figure 2 , 6 and 9 . For example , a continent column is created for drill down and roll up purposes later during map visualization . Fig . 7 . Algorithm Model Merge Join Item Group Fig . 8 .

Implementation of Blank Data Detection and for Blank Data Cleaning . There are several cases that result in empty data , such as users forgetting to fill in data , missing data not recorded , program errors , and so on . So the authors searched and handled empty data with an algorithm of empty data detection and blank data cleansing . The flow of steps is shown in Figure 10 , the empty data detection algorithm can be seen in Figure 11 , the empty data fill detection in the address attribute row is shown in Figure 12 , and then dropped in Figure 13 .

Implementation of the Folium Algorithm for Interactive Map Visualization This research is to reveal a pattern of distribution of covert insights about SolarmanPV data grouped by continent and country to allow roll up and drill down of data . There are 6 continents where PLTS are installed , namely North America , South America , Europe , Africa , Asia , Australia . The flow of steps is shown in Figure 18 , and the snippet of Map Visualization is shown in Figure 19 . Figure 20 shows sample distribution of PLTS on a continent level using Folium library .

Fig . 21 . Visualization of Map of South American Continent Apart from using Folium library for map visualization , the authors have also performed similar map visualization of the PLTS global distribution using Google Earth Pro to compare the produced maps . Here the markers are added with a pop - up window feature as a tooltip to display more detailed data regarding certain PLTS when hovered on . The sample results are shown in Figure 23 , where a detailed information extracted from the data source are rearranged and displayed as a tool tip . Such features can be customized as required to suit . Fig . 22 . Map Visualization of Indonesia Fig . 23 .

C ONCLUSION There is a hard need to visualize and study the growth of global adoption of rooftop solar PV , and this is the main objective of this research , as part of a clean and environmentally friendly effort through using vastly available source of Renewable Energy . The author deliberately collected data on a global scale . Data extraction and cleansing have been carried out on the SolarmanPV dataset as a global data storage of rooftop PV IoT data from globally connected IoT PV cloud server . Having cleaned the data into suitable dataset , exploratory analysis has been accomplished using visual models for information visualization on a map of the PLTS global distribution . Python programming language equipped with necessary libraries proved to be useful and effective in solving the main objective . Map visualization with Google Earth Pro software and ranking of PLTS capacity users throughout the world by year are achieved so well , opening more opportunity for future developments . From the results obtained , it is concluded that data analysis using visual models , especially geospatial maps , is very helpful in finding patterns of covert information in SolarmanPV data into insightful and interactive visual information .
