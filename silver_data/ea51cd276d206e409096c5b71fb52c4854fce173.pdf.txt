THE NATURE AND EXPERIENCE OF ENTREPRENEURIAL PASSION MELISSA S . CARDON Pace University JOAKIM WINCENT Luleå University of Technology JAGDIP SINGH Case Western Reserve University MATEJA DRNOVSEK University of Ljubljana Entrepreneurial passion plays an important role in entrepreneurship , but theoretical understanding of what it is and what it does is lacking . We build on fragmented and disparate extant work to conceptualize the nature of entrepreneurial passion associ - ated with salient entrepreneurial role identities . We also theorize the mechanisms of the experience of entrepreneurial passion that provide coherence to goal - directed cognitions and behaviors during the pursuit of entrepreneurial effectiveness . Passion is deeply embedded in the folklore and practice of entrepreneurship . Dating back to Schumpeter’s early writings ( 1951 ) , researchers and practitioners alike have invoked passion to explain entrepreneurial behaviors that defy rea - son - based explanations , such as unconven - tional risk taking , uncommon intensity of focus , and unwavering belief in a dream . In the popu - lar press , successful entrepreneurs have stressed the power of passion : Anita Roddick of the Bodyshop asserted that “to succeed you have to believe in something with such a pas - sion that it becomes a reality , ” and Michael Dell suggested that “passion should be the fire that drives your life’s work . ” 1 Many academics con - cur , including Bird , who says that entrepreneur - ial behavior can be “passionate , full of emo - tional energy , drive , and spirit” ( 1989 : 7 – 8 ) . Cardon , Zietsma , Saparito , Matherne , and Davis suggest that entrepreneurship can be thought of as a “tale of passion” ( 2005 : 23 ) , and Smilor goes so far as to say that passion is “perhaps the most observed phenomenon of the entrepreneur - ial process” ( 1997 : 342 ) . Despite the widespread fascination with en - trepreneurial passion , it has not been studied systematically , and existing research is frag - mented . Moreover , while emphasizing that pas - sion is important for entrepreneurship , most studies neither adequately define entrepreneur - ial passion nor explain its role in the entrepre - neurial process and its outcomes . We aim to fill this gap by developing a definition of the nature of entrepreneurial passion and theorizing about the experience of entrepreneurial passion to of - fer predictions about its influence in the entre - preneuring process . Specifically , we first address what passion is by proposing a definition of the entrepreneurial passion concept based on psychological re - search on emotions ( Barrett , Mesquita , Ochsner , & Gross , 2007 ; Russell , 2003 ) and on identity ( Burke , 2006 ; Stryker & Burke , 2000 ) , as well as grounded work in entrepreneurship . Second , we address what passion does by proposing a con - ceptual framework to theorize the mechanisms that coordinate the influence of role - identity - specific passion on entrepreneurs’ cognitions We sincerely appreciate the constructive comments and critical enthusiasm of the guest editors and three anony - mous reviewers , which challenged and excited us during the review process . We also thank Bill Schulze and Chuck Murnieks for helpful discussions and advice . In its early development this work benefited from generous feedback received during presentations at the 2004 Babson and 2005 Academy of Management conferences . 1 We accessed these quotes at http : / / www . evancarmichael . com .

We assert that the proposed framework can help explain previously unan - swered questions in the literature , such as why some nascent entrepreneurs who evidence high passion for entrepreneuring lose the fire of pas - sion as the venture grows while others continue to experience the fire of passion throughout their entrepreneurial career ; why some entre - preneurs who seem passionate about their ideas are willing to give them up to others to grow the venture and extract its market value ; and why some entrepreneurs continue to persist despite considerable obstacles and impedi - ments during the process of entrepreneuring . We use self - regulation as an overall theoretical framework to extract empirically testable prop - ositions . PASSION IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP : REVIEW AND RELEVANCE Table 1 summarizes the literature on passion and related emotions in entrepreneurship . We include studies that focus on individual entre - preneurs who found new ( de novo ) ventures and / or pursue opportunity recognition , venture creation , or venture growth activities . Consis - tent with Baron ( 2008 ) , we focus on entrepreneurs who individually recognize and exploit opportu - nities rather than do so as part of a team . While past research is fragmented in its con - ceptualization and theoretical development , it is coherent in its recognition of the relevance of passion in entrepreneurship . Table 1 suggests three themes of convergence : ( 1 ) the content of “passion” is an intense positive emotion ( 2 ) whose empirical referents or objects usually in - volve venture - related opportunities , tasks , or ac - tivities and ( 3 ) that has a motivational effect that stimulates entrepreneurs to overcome obstacles and remain engaged . However , this review also identifies several gaps and open issues , includ - ing lack of a clear definition of entrepreneurial passion that is theoretically grounded , agree - ment over whether passion is a personal trait or is stimulated by an object or the context , and a conceptual model that explains how passion in - fluences entrepreneurial outcomes . We briefly review the preceding themes of convergence and gaps to motivate our study . Our review indicates that scholars view pas - sion as important but are unclear on what it actually is . Studies define or associate passion with a diverse range of positive affects , includ - ing pride ( Bierly , Kessler , & Christensen , 2000 ) , love ( Baum & Locke , 2004 ; Cardon et al . , 2005 ) , enthusiasm , and joy ( Smilor , 1997 ) that occur as part of the entrepreneuring process and provide an emotional resource for coping with entrepre - neurial challenges . While Schumpeter long rec - ognized that an entrepreneur needs unusually strong will and personal strength during the process of creation , which “is inherently emo - tional” ( Goss , 2005 : 209 ) , few studies to date have provided an original theoretical foundation for linking entrepreneurial passion to the broader literature on affect and emotional experiences . The current literature is also vague in identi - fying the object of entrepreneurial passion and includes ventures , opportunities , products , tasks , or , generally , “one’s work” ( see Table 1 ) . This suggests an implicit relevance of address - ing what entrepreneurs are passionate about , but there is no agreement on which specific ref - erents should be considered . Moreover , some studies treat passion as an individual trait , giv - ing less emphasis to the specific objects in - volved ( e . g . , Baum , Locke , & Smith , 2001 ) . Others argue that both the individual and the venture must be considered given that entrepreneurs in - vest themselves ( e . g . , in terms of time , money , and energy ) heavily in their ventures ( Cardon et al . , 2005 ) . Thus , the centrality of venture - related objects appears evident in conceptualizing en - trepreneurial passion , but supporting theoreti - cal work is lacking . Table 1 indicates that the literature is also unclear about the mechanisms for how passion influences outcomes . Scholars suggest that en - trepreneurs who experience passion benefit from its motivational energy . For example , Ta - ble 1 indicates that passion involves strength and courage ( Bierly et al . , 2000 ) , mobilizing en - ergy ( Bra¨nnback , Carsrud , Elfving , & Krueger , 2006 ) , and unflagging pursuit of challenging goals ( Smilor , 1997 ) . Passion has been related to drive , tenacity , willingness to work long hours , courage , high levels of initiative , and persis - tence in the face of obstacles ( Bierly et al . , 2000 ; Bird , 1989 ) . Bra¨nnback et al . note that “passion can fuel motivation , enhance mental activity , and provide meaning to everyday work” ( 2006 : 3 ) . Likewise , scholars suggest that highly acti - vated and positive emotional states such as passion foster creativity and recognition of new 512 July Academy of Management Review T A B L E 1 A R ev i e w o f L it e r a t u r e F o c u s i ng o n A ff e c t and Pa ss i o n i n En t r e p r e n e u r s h i p A u t h o r s C o n s t r u c t C o n s t r u c t C o n c e p t ua li z a ti o n O b j e c t o f A ff e c t T y p e o f R e s e a r c h F i n d i ng s and I m p li c a ti o n s Ba r o n ( 2008 ) A ff e c t F ee li n g s , m oo d s , and e m o ti o n s S it ua ti o na l eve n t s o r s t ab l e t e nd e n c i e s o f p e r s o n C o n c e p t ua l A ff e c t i n fl u e n c e s m an y a s p e c t s o f e n t r e p r e n e u r i a l c o gn iti o n an d b e ha v i o r and i s i m p o r t an t f o r o pp o r t un it y r e c o gn iti o n and r e s o u r c e a c qu i s iti o n .

Yet doubts remain about whether entrepreneurial passion is uni - versally functional in the entrepreneurial pro - cess . Dysfunctional effects of passion , such as obsession and discounting negative information ( Branzei & Zietsma , 2003 ) , are thought to inter - fere with entrepreneurial effectiveness . Original theoretical work is needed to understand if and when entrepreneurial passion has functional outcomes and why . Overall , the preceding literature review sug - gests two critical gaps that need attention : ( 1 ) a theoretically grounded conceptualization of the nature of entrepreneurial passion to address what it is and ( 2 ) a theoretical model for the experience of entrepreneurial passion that guides empirical testing of its predicted influ - ence on cognitions and behaviors to explain what it does . THE NATURE OF ENTREPRENEURIAL PASSION We draw from the psychological literature on emotions and feelings and incorporate grounded ideas from entrepreneurship research and practice to propose a conceptual definition of entrepreneurial passion . Several notable re - views of psychological research on emotion are available ( e . g . , Barrett et al . , 2007 ; Russell , 2003 ; Schwarz & Clore , 2007 ) . We provide a summary of the working definitions of key psychological concepts relevant to our context in the Appen - dix . To build our conceptualization , we first out - line the supporting theoretical foundations for two key assertions central to our proposed con - ceptualization : ( 1 ) entrepreneurial passion is a consciously accessible , intense positive feeling , and ( 2 ) entrepreneurial passion results from en - gagement in activities with identity meaning and salience to the entrepreneur . Entrepreneurial Passion Is a Consciously Accessible , Intense Positive Feeling The notion of passion has a long history , with early writings about its nature and importance dating back to Greek and Western philosophers ( e . g . , Aristotle’s Rhetoric [ Roberts , 1924 ] ) , moral theologists ( e . g . , Spinoza’s Ethics [ Della Rocca , 1996 ] ) , political scientists ( e . g . , Machiavelli’s The Prince [ 1984 ] ) , and cultural mythologies ( e . g . , Bhagavad Gita [ Radhakrishnan , 1993 ] ) . While these writings differ on whether it impairs or empowers reason , most view passion as any intense emotion that stirs humans with energy and deep longing to make a difference . Social psychologists’ interest in studying passion is more recent and emphasizes its conscious expe - rience , motivational quality , and identity mean - ing . Csikszentmihalyi ( 1990 ) , for instance , sug - gests that passion promotes intense , flowlike states of total absorption in one’s activities . Val - lerand and colleagues’ ( 2003 ) notion of passion is focused on activities in which people invest time and energy and that they find important . Other scholars argue that passion is activated by emotionally important goals that control and guide desires , thoughts , plans , and behaviors and that persist over time , regardless of costs , external obstacles , and moral objections ( Frijda , 2005 ) . Across these definitions , passion invari - ably involves feelings that are hot , overpower - ing , and suffused with desire . This fire of desire is referred to in virtually all writings on entre - preneurial passion with words such as enthusi - asm , zeal , and intense longing ( Table 1 ) . In the psychological literature passion is con - ceived as energy that gives individuals a sense of “pleasure and promise” ( Rockwell , 2002 : 52 ) and engages them “wholeheartedly with what . . . [ they ] love” ( Belitz & Lundstrom , 1997 : 57 ) . The scholarly view of passion is compatible with a feeling that is highly intense and positive , sim - ilar to excitement , elation , and joy , but distinct from states that are negative and intense ( e . g . , upset , stressed ) , states that are not at all intense ( e . g . , fatigued , calm ) , or states that are positive but not intense ( e . g . , contented ) . As a feeling , passion involves consciously experienced changes in core affect ( i . e . , internal affective state ) that are attributed to external stimuli and that are effortfully reflected upon and stored cognitively for later retrieval ( Damasio , 2003 ; Schwarz & Clore , 2007 ; see also the Appendix ) . Reflection might include self - awareness ( “What am I feeling physically ? ” ) , appraisals ( “Why am I feeling this way ? ” “What caused this feel - ing ? ” ) , and categorization ( “How does it compare with other feelings ? ” ) . As a feeling , entrepre - neurial passion differs from episodic changes in core affect . While the latter is subconsciously or unconsciously activated by external objects or activities that may be inert or irrelevant to an individual’s identity meaning , passion involves 2009 515 Cardon , Wincent , Singh , and Drnovsek “intense longing” that one feels for objects or activities that are deeply meaningful to one’s identity , whether those objects are real , remem - bered , desired , imagined , or anticipated . We discuss the implication of this identity meaning of entrepreneurial activities next . Entrepreneurial Passion Results from Engagement in Activities with Identity Meaning and Salience In our view , passion is aroused not because some entrepreneurs are inherently disposed to such feelings but , rather , because they are en - gaged in something that relates to a meaningful and salient self - identity for them . For example , Baum and Locke ( 2004 ) and Shane , Locke , and Collins ( 2003 ) say that entrepreneurial passion is a love of work ; Smilor ( 1997 ) argues it is about enthusiasm for venture - related activities ; Car - don et al . ( 2005 ) say that passion is about love for the venture itself ; and Vallerand and colleagues define passion as a “strong inclination toward an activity that people like , that they find impor - tant” ( 2003 : 757 ) . Although Vallerand et al . sug - gest that identity meaning is important for un - derstanding passion , they do not explicitly consider identities in their proposed definition of passion , nor is their definition specific to en - trepreneurship . Murnieks and Mosakowski ( 2006 ) also invoke identities , arguing that pas - sion emerges when a broad entrepreneurial role identity is salient . We extend the work of these authors by devel - oping the notion of distinct entrepreneurial role identities that are linked to particular activities . Specifically , based on a taxonomy of entrepre - neurial activities developed by Gartner , Starr , and Bhat ( 1999 ) , we suggest three role identities : ( 1 ) an inventor identity , where the entrepreneur’s passion is for activities involved in identifying , inventing , and exploring new opportunities ; ( 2 ) a founder identity , where the entrepreneur’s pas - sion is for activities involved in establishing a venture for commercializing and exploiting op - portunities ; and ( 3 ) a developer identity , where the entrepreneur’s passion is for activities re - lated to nurturing , growing , and expanding the venture once it has been created . Undeniably , some entrepreneurs may be equally passionate about all three of these identities , whereas oth - ers may weigh one identity as significantly more meaningful to them . Identity theory ( Burke & Reitzes , 1981 , 1991 ; Goffman , 1959 ) , especially the literature focus - ing on conceptions of identity rooted in the self ( Stryker & Burke , 2000 ) , provides the theoretical logic for conceptualizing these three role identi - ties . Here the focus is on the “active self” that asks , “Who am I ? ” and on how this self - knowledge motivates reflexive thought and self - initiated action to create , sustain , and change larger social and economic conditions to help one’s self - growth and survival ( Burke & Reitzes 1991 ) . Researchers have defined identity as in - ternalized expectations about those characteris - tics individuals hold as central , distinctive , and enduring about them and that are at least par - tially reflected in the roles they enact ( Burke & Reitzes , 1991 ) . For example , entrepreneurs who find self - meaning in the role of an inventor brimming with market - disruption ideas are likely to view the inventor identity as a central , possibly defining , and enduring characteristic about their self . Noting that the self is composed of multifaceted identities , identity theory ac - knowledges that , for any individual , identities are organized hierarchically such that an iden - tity placed higher in the hierarchy is more sa - lient and more central to self - meaning than those placed lower ( Stryker & Burke , 2000 ) . Therefore , some entrepreneurs may view a founder , rather than inventor , identity as more salient and central , and , consequently , they may be committed more to the role of creating a new venture than to that of exploring or inventing new opportunities . Indeed , over a lifetime , an entrepre - neur may change the salience of different role identities ( e . g . , founder may become more central than inventor ) ; however , at any given time , the relative importance of role identities is stable , making an entrepreneur’s self - meaning tempo - rally both distinctive and coherent . This distinctive and salient role identity moti - vates entrepreneurs to engage in certain activi - ties ( and disengage from others ) and explains the affective experience that this engagement invokes . In particular , identities are a source of motivation for actions that result in social vali - dation of self - meaning . Role identities put peo - ple in social categories ( e . g . , “I am an inventor” ) , and individuals are motivated to maintain and confirm their self - meaning by engaging in ac - tivities and interacting with people in ways that confirm the role expectations and validate the behavioral implications of salient social catego - 516 July Academy of Management Review ries ( Burke & Reitzes , 1981 , 1991 ; Goffman , 1959 ) . Burke and Reitzes ( 1991 ) likened this to an active self that seeks engagement in activities that confirm and disengagement from those activi - ties that distract from salient identities . Such engagement in activities that validate salient identities is often not affect neutral ; rather , it arouses positive affect in accord with affect control theory ( Burke & Reitzes , 1991 ) . In - dividuals experience positive emotions when their behavioral engagement maintains and en - hances their salient identity . When such ap - praisals are congruent ( behaviors reinforce the salient identity ) , activities are tagged with pos - itive emotions , motivational resources are bol - stered , and these associative links are stored in memory for later retrieval . Conversely , when ap - praisals lack congruence ( behaviors are con - trary to the salient identity ) , activities are tagged with negative emotion , motivational re - sources are mobilized to disengage , and such activities are possibly stored with avoidance links . Over repeated cycles and for some indi - viduals , certain activities become associated with intense positive feelings because they re - liably and strongly support the individuals’ sa - lient identity and motivate the individuals to experience the positive feelings that come from continued engagement in such identity - mean - ingful activities . Consistent with the preceding logic , popular accounts indicate that entrepreneurs are often differentially passionate toward entrepreneur - ial activities . For instance , entrepreneurs with a salient inventor identity , exemplified by Stephan Wozniak , are aroused by passion when they engage in activities that involve seeking out new ideas , tinkering with new product de - velopment , or scanning the environment for market - disruptive opportunities . Alternatively , entrepreneurs who have the founder identity as most salient , such as Wayne Huizenga , experi - ence passion for activities that involve assem - bling the resources necessary to create a firm , including financial ( e . g . , VC funding ) , human ( e . g . , employees ) , and social ( e . g . , board mem - bers ) capital . Finally , entrepreneurs whose self - meaning is derived from the developer identity , exemplified by Ray Kroc , experience passion when they engage in activities related to market development ( e . g . , attracting new customers ) and financial growth ( e . g . , value creation and appropriation ) . It is not necessary that entrepreneurs have a single identity that is hierarchically dominant . However , when they do , entrepreneurs may dis - engage from activities relevant to other less meaningful identities . For example , entrepre - neurs may be so passionate about the inventor role that they never actually take their products to the market or found the venture to exploit the opportunity . Similarly , serial and portfolio en - trepreneurs may be more passionate about the founder role and willing to sell their firm to others who are more interested in growing the venture to realize its full market potential . More generally , entrepreneurs may have multiple identities that depict varying patterns and are organized in a hierarchy of more or less impor - tance , where none is clearly dominant or where some may be in conflict . Burke ( 2006 ) has noted that multiple identities shift focus to internal organization of identities , and to mechanisms by which the active self negotiates among dif - ferent identities . Consideration of multiple en - trepreneurial role identities may help explain conditions that lead to harmonious passion ( e . g . , when an entrepreneur can easily transition among salient role identities ) and to obsessive passion ( e . g . , when one role identity crowds out other identities ) . Thus , it matters which specific role identity invokes passion for entrepreneurs , to what extent it interferes in the fulfillment of roles related to other identities , and how an entrepreneur’s active self manages multiple identities . In summary , we conceptualize the nature of entrepreneurial passion as consciously accessi - ble , intense positive feelings experienced by en - gagement in entrepreneurial activities associ - ated with roles that are meaningful and salient to the self - identity of the entrepreneur . Next we discuss the experience of entrepreneurial pas - sion to address what it does . THE EXPERIENCE OF ENTREPRENEURIAL PASSION : COORDINATION OF COGNITIONS AND BEHAVIORS FOR ENTREPRENEURIAL EFFECTIVENESS Once activated , entrepreneurial passion cata - lyzes full - blown emotional experiences , com - plete with engagement of brain ( e . g . , appraisals and cognitions ) and body ( e . g . , physiological and behavioral ) responses ( Russell , 2003 ) . The notion of emotional experience recognizes that 2009 517 Cardon , Wincent , Singh , and Drnovsek the brain and body responses triggered by pas - sion do not appear as independent and discon - nected responses but , rather , as a coherent and coordinated pattern that is maintained over time ( Damasio , 2003 ; see also the Appendix ) . As such , the passion experience facilitates an en - trepreneur’s efforts to adapt and cope with en - vironmental challenges . This does not presume that the resulting adaptation and coping are necessarily functional . Instead , we acknowl - edge that the experience of entrepreneurial pas - sion may produce response patterns that are obsessive , blind , or misdirected ( e . g . , Vallerand et al . , 2003 ) . Cases abound of entrepreneurs who obsess about their ventures to the point that it curbs growth or who persist with failing ventures long after they should have moved on . In prefac - ing our conceptual model , we define the experi - ence of entrepreneurial passion as a complex pat - tern of psychological , brain , and body responses activated and maintained by an entrepreneur’s passion that , when regulated , aid in motivating coherent and coordinated goal pursuit . Below , we elaborate the proposed model with self - regulation theory as the overarching conceptual framework . Several aspects of self - regulation theory ( Carver & Scheier , 1998 ) make it relevant for understanding how and why entrepreneurial passion might coordinate entrepreneurs’ cogni - tions and behaviors . First , self - regulation pro - cesses are central to human agency ( effortful and conscious engagement of the self ) and hu - man coping ( mobilization of body and brain re - sponses to overcome challenges ) . The notions of agency and coping are compatible with entre - preneurial thinking that recognizing , reshaping , and responding to opportunities lie at the nexus of the individual and the environment ( Shane & Venkataraman , 2000 ) . Second , self - regulation theory views individual agency and coping as goal - directed processes , just as entrepreneurs are thought to engage in exploration and exploi - tation activities in pursuit of desired goals . Goals provide direction and clarity to entrepre - neurial efforts . Third , individual differences in self - regulation are known to influence coping effectiveness . Likewise , entrepreneurs differ in the degree to which they can regulate their in - ternal feeling states and behavioral responses to cope effectively , especially when multiple feeling states associated with disparate identi - ties are activated . For instance , entrepreneurs may demonstrate a range of regulative control , from underregulation , characterized by an in - ability to optimally control or balance internal feeling states and giving way to impulsive re - sponses , to overregulation , characterized by suppression of one or more internal feeling states and a lack of response spontaneity and novelty ( Gross , 1999 ) . Figure 1 depicts the proposed conceptual model . The modeled processes are triggered when entrepreneurial passion is activated ( shown in the left - most circle ) , and they culmi - nate in entrepreneurial outcomes ( shown in the right - most box ) . Consistent with three iden - tities proposed as meaningful for entrepreneurs , we include indicators of entrepreneurial out - comes that can be loosely categorized into those involving opportunity recognition ( e . g . , inventor identity ) , venture creation ( e . g . , founder iden - tity ) , and venture growth ( e . g . , developer identi - ty ) . 2 When a particular identity is activated ( say , inventor ) , we expect that the experience of pas - sion mobilizes an entrepreneur’s self - regulation processes that are directed toward effectiveness in the pursuit of the corresponding entrepre - neurial goal ( here , opportunity recognition ) . This goal pursuit , in turn , involves validating the focal identity by cognitive and behavioral en - gagement in activities in a manner that is char - acteristic of intense positive emotions . Conse - quently , the self - regulation processes linking entrepreneurial passion and outcomes are rep - resented by linkages involving goal - related cognitions and entrepreneurial behaviors ( the two middle boxes in Figure 1 ) . We argue that entrepreneurs fired by passion evidence behav - ioral engagement in entrepreneurial activities that is characterized by ( 1 ) creative problem solving , defined as the production of novel and useful ideas or actions ( Woodman , Sawyer , & Griffin , 1993 ) ; ( 2 ) persistence , defined as the con - tinuation of effortful action despite failures , im - pediments , or threats , either real or imagined ( Gimeno , Folta , Cooper , & Woo , 1997 ) ; and ( 3 ) 2 While we include these three broad categories of entre - preneurial effectiveness in our model and specify potential metrics for each category based on entrepreneurship re - search , we do not view these indicators as definitive or complete . Additional details on opportunity recognition are available in Singh , Hills , Lumpkin , and Hybels ( 1999 ) , ven - ture creation in Gartner ( 1985 ) , and venture growth in Haber and Reichel ( 2005 ) . 518 July Academy of Management Review F I G U R E 1 A C o n c e p t ua l M o d e l o f t h e E x p e r i e n c e o f En t r e p r e n e u r i a l Pa ss i o n a R o l e i d e n titi e s t ha t m a y b e m e a n i ng f u l f o r e n t r e p r e n e u r s i n c l ud e i n ve n t o r , f o und e r , and d eve l o p e r i d e n titi e s ( s ee t ex t f o r m o r e d e t a il s ) . 2009 519 Cardon , Wincent , Singh , and Drnovsek absorption , defined as being fully concentrated and deeply engrossed in one’s work ( Schinde - hutte , Morris , & Allen , 2006 ) . Note that persis - tence , which refers to the duration of task en - gagement , is conceptually and empirically distinct from absorption , which refers to the level of task involvement . We organize our discussion of the experience of entrepreneurial passion by emphasizing that the role fulfillment for each identity involves a focus on the goal corresponding to a specific set of entrepreneurial outcomes , and this goal pur - suit is differentially affected by entrepreneurial behaviors . We first focus on how entrepreneur - ial passion influences these behaviors directly , and we then focus on how it influences these behaviors indirectly through goal - related cogni - tions . Direct Effects in the Experience of Entrepreneurial Passion Because passion involves intense and plea - surable feelings arising from engagement in ac - tivities associated with a role identity that is deeply meaningful , we expect entrepreneurs to regulate their responses to maintain or enhance such feelings . With experience and learning , en - trepreneurs may encode a coherent pattern of behavioral responses as part of schema for a specific role identity that can be autonomously activated without much cognitive effort . Such autonomous response patterns are the direct ef - fects in Figure 1 ( paths A , B , and C ) . Based on the psychology of positive emotions ( Fredrickson , 1998 ) , we posit that the intense feelings associated with passion will result in an inverted - U effect on entrepreneurs’ creative problem solving ( path A in Figure 1 ) . Individuals experiencing positive affect have an adaptive approach to environmental stimuli , motivating their attention and energy to tackle encountered challenges or problems . When problems stand in the way of dreams , desires , or purpose deeply rooted in the self - identity , entrepreneurs who are experiencing passion are more likely to reg - ulate their attention and motivation to identify solutions that could otherwise go unnoticed or unexploited . In this sense , passion more readily facilitates creation of unusual associations , such as recognition of patterns and relatedness among stimuli , enabling entrepreneurs to en - gage in novel and creative paths of action ( Fredrickson , 1998 ) . Thus , we expect the regula - tory influence of passion to enable entrepre - neurs to recognize novel patterns of information , to perceptually process stimuli , and to leverage their existing knowledge to find creative solu - tions . This reasoning is consistent with Am - abile’s ( 1997 : 42 ) finding that people who are fired by passion are more likely to pursue cre - ative solutions . However , passion that is too positive or in - tense can limit an entrepreneur’s creative prob - lem solving . We theorize that this occurs be - cause the entrepreneur is resistant to exploring alternative options , fearing that doing so may dilute and distract the intense positive experi - ence , thereby curtailing the productive and flex - ible problem - solving approach associated with passion . Consistent with this , Vallerand and colleagues ( 2003 ) suggested that extremely in - tense passion may invoke an obsessive re - sponse indicated by a rigid rather than flexible manner of engagement in identity - relevant ac - tivities because the focal identity crowds out other identities , consistent with the notion of its having “disproportionate space” within a per - son’s life . Thus , we posit the following . Proposition 1 : Entrepreneurial passion will have an inverted - U influence on creative problem solving directed at identity - relevant activities . The importance of creative problem solving for effectiveness is especially germane when an entrepreneur’s passion is for the inventor iden - tity . In this instance validation and affirmation of the entrepreneur’s identity will come from effectiveness in opportunity recognition rather than other outcomes . Such an entrepreneur will be particularly driven toward engagement in creative pursuit of identifying , inventing , and exploring new opportunities or market niches ( Wilson & Stokes , 2005 ) . Past research suggests that creative problem solving is particularly im - portant for generating novel and useful ideas and opportunities for business ventures ( Ward , 2004 ) . For instance , many entrepreneurs are challenged by identifying novel market oppor - tunities that are concurrently interesting , com - patible with their individual human capital and skills , innovative for the potential market , and viable as a profit - making venture . Thus , while persistence and absorption behaviors can be helpful in effective opportunity recognition , en - 520 July Academy of Management Review trepreneurial engagement in creative problem solving is crucial . Proposition 2 : When an entrepreneur’s inventor identity is dominant , entre - preneurial passion will influence the entrepreneur’s effectiveness in oppor - tunity recognition , mainly because of its effect on creative problem solving . As depicted by the direct path B in Figure 1 , we also expect that passion will positively and directly influence an entrepreneur’s persistence on tasks that validate and reaffirm the identity activated by passion . Support for this assertion is drawn from psychological studies of behav - ioral patterns associated with and regulated by positive feelings ( Fredrickson , 1998 ) . In general , positive feelings enhance continued engage - ment in tasks and activities that invoke such feelings , because people want to maintain a positive emotional state and resist disengage - ment ( Pham , 2004 ) . When the focal activities are not only pleasurable but are also deeply mean - ingful to self - identity , we can expect that indi - viduals will be bolstered to persist so that they can enjoy a prolonged state of positive affect , reinforce their role identity , and mitigate the risk of identity threats that come from premature disengagement ( Burke , 2006 ; Pratt & Foreman , 2000 ) . Consequently , we posit the following . Proposition 3 : Entrepreneurial passion will positively influence an entrepre - neur’s persistence on identity - relevant activities . When an entrepreneur’s passion is associated with the founder identity , we expect that the entrepreneur will regulate his or her attention and motivation in pursuit of venture creation goals . For effectiveness in this pursuit , we ex - pect that persistence and creative problem solv - ing will be particularly important . The liabilities of smallness and newness are most prominent at the venture creation stage ( D’Intino , Goldsby , Houghton , & Neck , 2007 ) . Entrepreneurs face con - siderable challenges , including rejection of ideas , refusal of funding requests , and lack of legitimacy , which together may turn away po - tential customers as well as employees . To se - cure funding , locate customers , hire employees , and more generally establish the firm’s reputa - tion and legitimacy , an entrepreneur’s persis - tence in the pursuit of financial , human , and social capital is critical ( Gimeno et al . , 1997 ) . We expect that the regulatory influence of in - tense positive feelings associated with the founder identity is likely to mobilize action and the needed energy of entrepreneurs to master challenging situations by overcoming uncer - tainties , setbacks , and resource shortages in the assembly of financial , human , and social capi - tal . Bierley and colleagues ( 2000 ) affirmed that passion is linked to energetic and persistent goal pursuit , particularly the ability to overcome resistance , obtain resources , coordinate activity , and motivate key people . However , creative problem solving in developing new ways of reaching out to potential investors , employees , and customers is also important . For example , Elsbach ( 2003 ) studied venture capital pitch ses - sions and found that the investors often made their investment decision at least in part based on the creativity of the entrepreneur making the pitch . More broadly , Lee , Florida , and Acs ( 2004 ) argued that creativity has a positive relation - ship with new firm formation . Proposition 4 : When an entrepreneur’s founder identity is dominant , entre - preneurial passion will influence the entrepreneur’s effectiveness in ven - ture creation , mainly because of its effect on persistence and creative problem solving . We also predict that entrepreneurial passion will positively influence absorption with entre - preneurial activities associated with the in - voked role identity ( path C ) . Engagement in tasks and activities that hold identity meaning is posited to be an experience akin to “flow , ” where entrepreneurs become immersed in and feel in complete control of their activities such that they barely notice the passing of time or the people around them ( Csikszentmihalyi , 1990 ) . The combination of intense excitement and fo - cus , which are defining characteristics of flow experiences , is central to the experiential and regulation effects of entrepreneurial passion . When entrepreneurs are aroused by their pas - sion for activities associated with a meaningful identity , they experience intense excitement that comes from pursuit of deeply internalized goals such that they often ignore activities or people that may detract from it . 2009 521 Cardon , Wincent , Singh , and Drnovsek Some scholars suggest that entrepreneurs’ success largely depends on their regulative ca - pabilities to cultivate personal flow experiences ( e . g . , Schindehutte et al . , 2006 ) . Successful entre - preneurs , such as Bill Gates , who are able to continuously innovate in highly competitive and rapidly evolving markets are thought to be ca - pable of remaining in states of flow for much longer periods of time than the average busi - ness person ( D’Intino et al . , 2007 ) . Thus , we ex - pect a positive relationship between entrepre - neurial passion and absorption . Proposition 5 : Entrepreneurial passion will positively influence an entrepre - neur’s absorption in identity - relevant activities . Further , an entrepreneur’s goal pursuit is likely to be regulated for venture growth when the developer identity is at the fore of entrepre - neurial passion . In this instance we expect that an entrepreneur’s absorption and persistence are relatively more significant for effectiveness in venture growth , although creative problem solving is also relevant . The challenges of ven - ture growth involve navigating the chaos and ambiguity of markets that come from continu - ously evolving customer needs and unrelenting competitive moves ( Schindehutte et al . , 2006 ) . When entrepreneurs approach venture growth activities with a high level of absorption , they are less prone to be perturbed by environmental ambiguity and are more likely to engage in them with clarity and focus ( Jelinek & Litterer , 1995 ) . In addition , the liability of growth poses challenges of managing competing pressures , including maintaining rapid growth while pro - viding bureaucratic stability , along with the need to simultaneously monitor changing mar - ket and environmental conditions ( e . g . , Slevin & Covin , 1997 ) . Such challenges require resolve and sustained effort over time in order to effec - tively cope with the considerable tension , tran - sition , and change involved in venture growth . Thus , the combination of focused attention ( ab - sorption ) and continued efforts ( persistence ) is critical to market growth activities . Proposition 6 : When an entrepreneur’s developer identity is dominant , entre - preneurial passion will influence the entrepreneur’s effectiveness in ven - ture growth , mainly because of its ef - fect on absorption and persistence . Thus far , we have assumed that an entrepre - neur’s role identities are organized hierarchi - cally such that only a single identity is domi - nant in the experience of entrepreneurial passion . In reality , this is not always the case . Entrepreneurs may have conflicting role identi - ties . However , at a given point in time , an entre - preneur’s passion may be associated with only one of the salient identities . In such instances multiple identities do not pose any conflict , and an entrepreneur can harmoniously navigate his or her passion for different identities . In some instances multiple identities may be concur - rently activated . For instance , in the nascent stages of venture creation , entrepreneuring may involve activities that relate to both inventor and founder identities , such as when entrepre - neurs present their ideas to a prospective ven - ture capitalist . In these situations the proposed direct effects will be contingent on the regula - tory capabilities of entrepreneurs . When the en - trepreneurs are able to regulate harmoniously among the invoked identities , the proposed ef - fects are likely to hold . However , when entrepre - neurs’ regulatory capabilities are challenged by identity conflict , we expect the proposed effects to be subdued and even to become nonsignifi - cant as the conflict dilutes and divides the en - trepreneurs’ attention and motivation . We ex - pect regulatory capabilities to vary across entrepreneurs and to influence the ability of the entrepreneurs to realize the positive outcomes from passion , especially in situations involving conflicting identities . Mediated Effects in the Experience of Entrepreneurial Passion We also argue that entrepreneurial passion will influence behaviors and , ultimately , effec - tiveness through its mediating effect on goal - related cognitions ( see Figure 1 ) . Despite past arguments that emotions and reason are inher - ently at odds , scholars now recognize that cog - nitions and emotions may act as coherent and connected systems that work together to dynam - ically regulate human behavior toward desired goals ( Damasio , 2003 ; Pham , 2004 ) . For example , Fredrickson ( 1998 ) postulated that positive feel - ings broaden one’s thought - action repertoires 522 July Academy of Management Review by activating ( via attentional processes ) and broadening ( via information processing ) the scope of cognitions , which , in turn , guides one’s behavioral response toward effective goal pur - suit . Seo , Barrett , and Bartunek ( 2004 ) specified broaden - and - build postulates for work motiva - tion by proposing goal cognitions as mediators of the influence of core affect . Building on these ideas , we propose media - tion effects of goal cognitions to reflect coordi - nation between passion and cognition during goal pursuit . Specifically , we propose that en - trepreneurial passion will influence the level of challenge inherent in the goals entrepreneurs set , their commitment to those goals , and the nature of their striving toward goal attainment . These goal cognitions , in turn , will have differ - ential effects on entrepreneurs’ creative prob - lem solving , persistence , and absorption in identity - relevant tasks . These behaviors will in - fluence entrepreneurial effectiveness , as we elaborated on in the preceding section . Consider the influence of entrepreneurial pas - sion mediated by goal challenge—the difficulty level of goals set ( paths d - g and d - h in Figure 1 ) . We expect that an entrepreneur’s passion will lead to setting more challenging goals for the tasks and activities associated with the invoked role identity , for two primary reasons . First , the positive valence of passion bolsters success be - liefs for activities that affirm and validate the identity associated with that passion . When en - trepreneurs engage in activities they are pas - sionate about , they are more confident and pos - itive in making evaluative judgments about possibilities of success in those activities . This may happen , for instance , because the entrepre - neurs interpret their intense positive feelings for identity - relevant tasks as affirmative informa - tion about their capabilities to meet environ - mental demands ( i . e . , “I feel good , so I must be good at this” ) , in accord with the feeling - as - information hypothesis ( Schwarz & Clore , 2007 ) . When success beliefs are bolstered , entrepre - neurs with passion are prone to set more chal - lenging goals than those who approach the fo - cal activities without being energized by passion . More generally , Locke and Latham ( 2002 ) suggested that positive feelings influence cognitive appraisals associated with setting challenging goals . Second , when entrepreneurs are passionate about a particular role identity , they are likely to have more expansive thought - action repertoires as per the broaden - and - build theory ( Fredrick - son , 1998 ; Seo et al . , 2004 ) , resulting in an en - larged sense of their capabilities and personal resources . In uncertain and dynamic situations where success expectancies are unknown , ines - timable , or fuzzy , entrepreneurs experiencing passion are more likely to be emboldened by their heightened sense of capabilities and re - sources to set more challenging goals than those entrepreneurs lacking the spark of pas - sion . Baum and Locke’s ( 2004 ) research suggests that entrepreneurs with passion are more prone to garner and invest resources like time and effort to develop needed capabilities for activi - ties they like and goals they aspire toward . Thus , passion is associated with setting chal - lenging goals . In turn , setting challenging goals is predicted to enhance creative problem solving and to in - hibit persistence on role - relevant activities . Cre - ativity in entrepreneurial tasks necessitates flexibly altering preexisting routines to explore new approaches and ideas that are effective in problem solving . Challenging goals , especially when they are self - set and identity relevant rather than assigned and identity irrelevant , are likely to energize entrepreneurs to expend greater effort and develop creative task strate - gies . This is because self - set challenging goals have motivational influence such that entrepre - neurs have a strong desire to achieve those goals so they can validate or bolster their inter - nalized entrepreneurial identity . When this mo - tivation is focused and directed by challenging goals to specific identity - relevant activities , studies report that individuals find and make better task strategies to attain goals ( Locke & Latham , 2002 ) . While challenging goals can increase persis - tence in stable and predictable environments ( Locke & Latham , 2002 ) , we expect the reverse effect in environments involving uncertain or ambiguous feedback during goal pursuit , such as entrepreneurship . When entrepreneurs set challenging goals , they are more likely to en - counter obstacles during goal pursuit , espe - cially in unstable environments where uncon - tested success is unlikely and where it is hard to assess whether performance goals are met . Such encumbered goal pursuit provides numer - ous instances of negative feedback . Although initial negative feedback may not perturb an 2009 523 Cardon , Wincent , Singh , and Drnovsek entrepreneur fired by passion , continued nega - tive feedback from the pursuit of challenging goals can result in the entrepreneur’s mitigating the growing threats to a strongly held identity by revising or disengaging from initial goals . Such actions diminish persistence on the chal - lenging goals . Also , given limited cognitive re - sources , a focus on developing and implement - ing ways to address challenging goals can consume considerable cognitive resources , lim - iting resources available for persisting in over - coming unexpected obstacles encountered dur - ing goal pursuit . Proposition 7 : Entrepreneurial passion for activities associated with a partic - ular identity will lead an entrepre - neur to set more challenging goals , resulting in ( a ) higher levels of cre - ative problem solving but ( b ) lower levels of persistence on identity - relevant activities . Next , we posit that goal commitment will me - diate the influence of entrepreneurial passion on creative problem solving , persistence , and absorption ( paths e - i , e - j , and e - k in Figure 1 ) . Goal commitment is defined as the extent of determination an individual has to attain a set goal ( Locke & Latham , 2002 ) . Because passion is associated with salient role identities , it should lead entrepreneurs to be intrinsically motivated to achieve the goals associated with affirming those identities . When entrepreneurs are intrin - sically motivated , they are likely to have greater commitment than those entrepreneurs who set instrumentally motivated goals . Studies show that commitment is not simply due to higher activation levels associated with positive emo - tion but , rather , to cognitive processes involving evaluation of rewards ( e . g . , more valued ) , effort - outcome linkages ( e . g . , more confident and stronger ) , and autonomous control ( e . g . , more self - directed ) from intrinsic motivation . Al - though no study in the entrepreneurship litera - ture has directly examined the relationship be - tween passion and goal commitment , indirect evidence exists that when positive feelings ac - tivate identity - relevant goals , entrepreneurs are motivated to effortfully engage in goal pursuit ( Baron & Ward , 2004 ) , which is a critical part of goal commitment . In turn , goal commitment is predicted to en - hance entrepreneurs’ absorption , creative prob - lem solving , and persistence . Once entrepre - neurs commit to set goals , their intrinsic motivation regulates them to focus their cogni - tions on attainment of identity - relevant goals and to suppress resources directed at identity - irrelevant activities and distractions ( Locke & Latham , 2002 ) . Suppression of goal - irrelevant distractions , combined with highly focused and motivated involvement , is conducive for flow ex - periences , thereby promoting task absorption ( Schindehutte et al . , 2006 ) . Further , when entre - preneurs are intrinsically motivated to engage in activities that validate their salient identity , we expect that they will demonstrate greater involvement in goal - directed tasks , resulting in a generative behavioral orientation , indicated by a focus on learning and enjoyment of identity - relevant activities . Such an orientation is as - sociated with a flexible approach to problems and enhanced creativity in problem solving . Fi - nally , we expect goal commitment to lead to greater persistence , because intrinsic motiva - tion is associated with higher levels of per - ceived autonomy and confident self - beliefs re - garding identity - salient activities that bolster an entrepreneur’s effort and attention toward goal - focused activities . In a recent study Schin - dehutte et al . found that entrepreneurs’ commit - ment level was a key indicator of peak perfor - mance , allowing them to persist as they “continue against the odds and overcome fa - tigue and pain to finish a task or meet a chal - lenge” ( 2006 : 353 ) . Thus , we propose the follow - ing . Proposition 8 : Entrepreneurial passion for activities associated with a partic - ular identity will lead to greater goal commitment , resulting in ( a ) higher levels of creative problem solving , ( b ) higher levels of persistence , and ( c ) higher levels of absorption in identity - relevant activities . Goal striving—defined as planning action , monitoring progress , and adjusting action plans based on impediments encountered during goal pursuit ( Oettingen & Gollwitzer , 2001 ) —is also posited to mediate the influence of entrepre - neurial passion on persistence and absorption ( Figure 1 , paths f - l and f - m ) . Entrepreneurial passion directs attention to challenging strate - gic goals related to a particular meaningful role identity , rather than more tactical goals needed 524 July Academy of Management Review to maintain progress on immediate tasks . This is because passion engages meaningful role iden - tities that are usually associated with abstract goals . Building on past research ( Seo et al . , 2004 ) , we reason that strong commitment to ini - tially set goals , combined with the goals’ higher level of abstraction ( strategic rather than tacti - cal ) , will make entrepreneurs less inclined to make frequent and thorough progress judg - ments and will inhibit them from altering and adjusting their initial goals . As a result , entre - preneurial passion should diminish goal striv - ing . Support for this comes from Baum and Locke ( 2004 ) , who noted that the energy of passion trig - gers a natural toughness to stick to the initial goals involved in venturing and an unwavering focus on those initially set goals . Likewise , Cova and Svanfeldt ( 1993 ) suggested that entrepre - neurs with high levels of passion are less sen - sitive to contrary market information and in - stead continue with initially determined plans . This is consistent with Schwarz and Clore’s ar - guments ( 2007 : 26 ) that when different process - ing styles are possible to meet current goals and task demands , happy individuals rely on a less effortful , top - down , heuristic information - pro - cessing strategy , although they are able and willing to engage in more careful and system - atic information processing ( which is associ - ated with goal striving ) when task demands require it . When entrepreneurs are more effective at goal striving , we predict that they are likely to evidence higher persistence but lower absorp - tion . First , entrepreneurs who engage in goal striving are planning and attending to task feedback , both of which are likely to lead to greater persistence in goal pursuit . Support for this comes from Liao and Gartner ( 2006 ) , who reported that entrepreneurs who engaged in planning activities were more persistent at new venture creation . Second , we expect goal striv - ing to diminish absorption in identity - relevant activities because it shifts attention away from strategic goals activated by entrepreneurial passion to more immediate tactical goals and associated feedback , thereby interrupting flow experiences that come from effortlessness in goal - directed actions . Support for this comes from Schindehutte et al . ( 2006 ) , who found that the flow experiences among founding entrepre - neurs had hallmarks of autotelic experiences , which are indicative of heuristic processing that is less compatible with the detailed cognitive processing associated with goal striving . Fi - nally , because goal striving involves monitoring progress feedback and attending to implemen - tation rather than innovation , we do not expect an association between goal striving and cre - ative problem solving . Proposition 9 : Entrepreneurial passion for activities associated with a partic - ular identity will lead to lower levels of goal striving , resulting in ( a ) lower levels of persistence ( a positive effect of goal striving on persistence ) and ( b ) higher levels of absorption ( a negative effect of goal striving on absorption ) in identity - relevant activities . DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS We have aimed to bring order to the disparate meanings and uses of the term passion in entre - preneurship by developing a theory for under - standing the nature and experience of entrepre - neurial passion that addresses what it is and what it does . Best viewed as a starting point for programmatic research , the proposed theoreti - cal framework facilitates examining outstand - ing questions about passion in entrepreneur - ship that have thus far received mixed or limited attention , and it invites empirical testing to guide further developments and refinements . We begin our discussion with contributions con - cerning the nature of entrepreneurial passion . Entrepreneurial Role Identities and the Nature of Entrepreneurial Passion Our conceptualization of the nature of entre - preneurial passion asserts that studies that ask what passion is or what it does must begin by addressing passion for what . We propose that entrepreneurial passion is for one or more meaningful roles that are salient to the self - identity of the entrepreneur and correspond to intense positive feelings consciously experi - enced by engagement in entrepreneurial activ - ities associated with the focal role ( s ) . We specif - ically discuss three role identities—inventor , founder , and developer—that are relevant for entrepreneurship . Past researchers , including Vallerand and col - leagues ( 2003 ) , have noted that passion involves 2009 525 Cardon , Wincent , Singh , and Drnovsek engagement in specific activities ( e . g . , biking ) or with specific objects ( e . g . , coin collections ) , and some have hinted that these activities and ob - jects have identity meaning . However , we are the first to explicitly break down the notion of an abstract entrepreneurial identity ( Murnieks & Mosakowski , 2006 ) so as to conceptualize and theoretically develop three specific role identi - ties that have distinct characteristics and relate to disparate entrepreneurial outcomes , includ - ing opportunity recognition ( inventor role ) , ven - ture creation ( founder role ) , and venture growth ( developer role ) . In so doing , our study moves beyond theories of entrepreneurship that implic - itly or explicitly portray the entrepreneurial role as motivated primarily by the instrumental goal of wealth creation and maximization . We do not rule out that , for some entrepreneurs , the mere thought of possessing unimaginable wealth may invoke intense positive feelings akin to passion . However , we argue that passion will be associated with the three roles developed here , because these have intrinsic motivation stem - ming from the validation and affirmation of an entrepreneur’s conception of true self , thereby activating authentic passions . In this sense wealth seeking is relevant but not central to the conception of the self . Conceptualizing entrepreneurial role identi - ties as central to the nature of entrepreneurial passion allows the field to ( 1 ) clarify the distinc - tion between passion and any positive emotion , ( 2 ) overcome the limitations of trait - based ap - proaches to entrepreneurial passion in explain - ing observed entrepreneurial behaviors , and ( 3 ) open new lines of theoretical and empirical in - quiry that current research neither facilitates nor illuminates . First , it is inappropriate to con - flate entrepreneurial passion with episodic emotions or to view it simply as any intense positive feeling . Episodic affect entails shifts in current moods that are primarily triggered by external events , are short term in duration , and are hardwired as involuntary responses to stim - uli . In contrast , entrepreneurial passion is con - sciously experienced and categorized feeling , invoked by engagement with activities an - chored to the entrepreneur’s self - identity and encoded based on effortful reflection , categori - zation , and integration of affective responses ( see the Appendix ) . Moreover , while an entrepre - neur’s positive emotions will be based on aggre - gating across a diverse set of activities that are engaged in over a ( short ) period of time , passion involves feelings experienced when entrepre - neurs engage in a set of activities that relate to a salient entrepreneurial identity and that en - dure over a longer period of time . Because we expect that only feelings associated with the inventor role identity and its meaningfulness will influence , for example , persistence in op - portunity recognition activities , an aggregated indicator of emotions is likely to lack compara - ble predictive and diagnostic power . An entre - preneur can , of course , experience passion and episodic emotions concurrently , and this is an area ripe for future inquiry . Second , some recent studies conceive of entre - preneurial passion as a traitlike , individual - difference variable ( Baum et al . , 2001 ; Shane et al . , 2003 ) . These approaches can explain why some entrepreneurs experience passion for their pursuits while for others entrepreneurship is a cognitive and rational pursuit , devoid of emo - tive content . However , our identity - based ap - proach is more flexible and can explain ob - served patterns of entrepreneurial behaviors that are not captured in the trait - based ap - proach . For instance , some nascent entrepre - neurs who evidence high passion for entrepre - neuring lose the fire of passion as the venture grows , just as some entrepreneurs with passion for discovering high - value - added market oppor - tunities are willing to let others take their ideas and extract market value by further growing the venture . Such patterns pose a challenge for the passion - as - trait approach because it asserts that passion will remain fairly stable across the life cycle of entrepreneurs . Our conception sug - gests that whether passion remains stable or is “lost” depends on variability in the differing lev - els of passion entrepreneurs have for different role identities . Third , in extending these lines of inquiry , we can hypothesize that some nascent entrepre - neurs may lose the fire of passion because less meaningful role identities are invoked for them as the venture grows . For example , in the early stages entrepreneurial activities are typically linked to an inventor identity , while in later stages activities are more likely related to a founder or developer role , which may be less central to an entrepreneur’s self - identity . Some entrepreneurs may find identity meaning in each role identity and may harmoniously shift from one identity to the other as the venture 526 July Academy of Management Review emerges and grows . Similarly , some entrepre - neurs who experience passion for their venture yet relinquish their inventions or ventures to others may have passion for the inventor or founder but not the developer identity . Although conjectural , such lines of inquiry are neither en - tertained in nor provoked by current conceptions and warrant future investigation . Empirical examination of the preceding in - sights will require developing a validated en - trepreneurial passion measure . Recent studies have taken initial steps by identifying activities toward which entrepreneurs have strong incli - nations , that they find important , and in which they invest time and energy as a way to mea - sure entrepreneurial passion ( Bra¨nnback et al . , 2006 ; Murnieks , 2007 ) . While important , these ef - forts neither link entrepreneuring activities to specific role identities nor capture activities at a specific enough level . Our definition instead suggests that original future work in operation - alizing entrepreneurial passion is needed to in - clude direct assessment of ( 1 ) the meaningful - ness of individual role identities for the entrepreneur ( e . g . , “Inventing new solutions to problems is an important part of who I am” ) , ( 2 ) the intensity of positive feelings for activities associated with individual role identities ( e . g . , “It is exciting to figure out new ways to solve unmet market needs that can be commercial - ized” ) , and ( 3 ) a rule for combining the preceding evaluations to develop a composite or latent entrepreneurial passion score for each identity . We note that such an operationalization paral - lels attitude measurements ( a multiplicative combination of beliefs and importance ratings ) , and much can be gained by drawing on the extensive experience with such measurements ( e . g . , Fishbein & Azjen , 1975 ) . Coordinated Regulation in the Experience of Entrepreneurial Passion Until recently , most studies expressed the view that passions cloud reason and that effec - tive decision making requires rational and rea - soned judgments ( Damasio , 1994 ) . For instance , Shane and Venkataraman ( 2000 ) asserted that optimism , an emotion related to passion , limits information , leads to rosy forecasts , and im - pedes reason ( act first , think later ) , and they emphasized the superiority of reason - based decisions for effectiveness in exploiting oppor - tunities . Our work goes beyond normative asser - tions of passion versus reason to develop theory - based predictions for a more balanced study of passion and reason as interdependent systems . In our view , when aroused , passion for entrepre - neurial identities coordinates and regulates en - trepreneurial cognitions and behaviors for goal pursuit . While this regulatory influence is not universally functional , the proposed theory of entrepreneurial passion clarifies when it is functional or dysfunctional by positing direct and goal - mediated effects on entrepreneuring behaviors , along with contingencies for its con - sequences for entrepreneurial outcomes that are regulated by the salient identity ( ies ) entwined in the experience of entrepreneurial passion . Our theorizing contributes to the literature by moving beyond global assertions about passion versus reason to provide a fine - grained under - standing of what passion does , when it is func - tional , and why . Our work suggests that what passion does varies , depending on ( 1 ) what the passion is for ( e . g . , which identity is involved and how salient that is to the individual ) , ( 2 ) which specific entrepreneurial behavior is con - sidered , ( 3 ) which particular goal cognitions are activated , and ( 4 ) what aspect of entrepreneurial effectiveness is of substantive interest . The pro - posed conceptual framework provides a system - atically organized approach to account for the preceding effects in a way that encourages em - pirical examination . For instance , we predict that entrepreneurs who experience passion for one or more salient identities will be more per - sistent and more absorbed in identity - relevant tasks but will be limited in their creative prob - lem solving beyond an intermediate point . Like - wise , our inclusion of goal cognitions as medi - ators of the influence of passion on behaviors suggests parallel and dynamics pathways for passion’s effects , rather than simple linear rela - tionships . Moreover , we advance a contingent view of entrepreneurial passion by theorizing differential effects of entrepreneurial behaviors on outcomes , depending on the specific identity invoked in the experience of entrepreneurial passion . When an inventor identity is invoked , for instance , opportunity recognition is the dom - inant goal and creative problem solving the con - sequential pathway for goal effectiveness . Our rich theorizing allows new insights into the observed heterogeneity in patterns of entre - preneurial success . For instance , why do some 2009 527 Cardon , Wincent , Singh , and Drnovsek entrepreneurs succeed in achieving impossible goals despite the odds and despite failures along the way , whereas others burn out too quickly , resulting in grief and disappointment ? Although past research has addressed these questions with variables such as personality traits , market forces , and luck , our theorizing suggests that passion may be a critical ingredi - ent in an entrepreneur’s success in achieving challenging goals not simply because it mobi - lizes energy and enhances commitment but , rather , because passion activates heuristic cog - nitive processing and coordinates broaden - and - build mechanisms that are especially func - tional . As such , our theory posits that entre - preneurs like Wayne Huizenga , Anita Roddick , and Stephan Wozniak may have succeeded be - cause they had high levels of passion for their entrepreneurial identities , in particular for the inventor identity , and this passion kept their energy focused on overarching but challenging goals and promoted cognitive mechanisms that were not easily hindered by temporary setbacks , impediments , or failures . Neverthe - less , at this stage our theorizing and proposi - tions are conjectural and warrant future empir - ical examination . Initial empirical testing of the proposed framework will likely require quasi - experimen - tal and nonexperimental approaches with entre - preneurship - relevant samples . One possible ap - proach focused on internal validity would be controlled , longitudinal quasi - experiments that used materials for activating passion ( e . g . , imagined task engagement ) and dynamically tracked individual entrepreneurs’ responses as they worked toward goal - directed tasks . Com - puter “game” models and role - playing algo - rithms may be effective for such experiments , as they have been in emotion studies ( Barrett et al . , 2007 ) , provided that identity salience can either be elicited or measured in such experiments . Another possible approach , focused on external validity , would be cohort , panel , or random sam - ple studies that examined the key assertions of the hypothesized framework in the field with entrepreneurs . CONCLUDING NOTES Much has been written and said about the nature and experience of entrepreneurial pas - sion , yet there is little to show for conceptual development of and theorizing about this in - triguing phenomenon . We correct this gap by proposing a theory of entrepreneurial passion that provides a systematic foundation for exam - ining what passion is and what it does for en - trepreneurs . We do not presume that entrepre - neurs can necessarily be trained to feel more or less passion for entrepreneuring . Neither do we assert that passion is a panacea for successfully coping with entrepreneurial challenges . Rather , our theorizing recognizes passion as a phenom - enon that is prevalent among entrepreneurs but is often loosely defined , confused with other emotions or misunderstood , and inadequately theorized for understanding its mechanisms of influence on entrepreneuring behaviors . Clarity about the nature of entrepreneurial passion and theorizing about its regulatory in - fluence have implications for theory and prac - tice . We hope that research guided by our theo - rizing will help entrepreneurs to recognize and effectively regulate their passions , harmoni - ously manage conflict among competing entre - preneurial identities , and mitigate the dysfunc - tional effects of passion . We encourage scholars to use our work as a starting point for systematic studies of entrepreneurial passion to provide insights for practice that nurture the fire of pas - sion for entrepreneurial effectiveness . APPENDIX : REVIEW OF KEY PSYCHOLOGICAL CONCEPTS RELEVANT FOR ENTREPRENEURIAL PASSION Core Affect and Affective Quality Core affect is generally defined as an inter - nal , free - floating , and objectless neurophysio - logical state that is represented by the elemen - tary affects of pleasure or displeasure ( i . e . , valence ) and of activation or deactivation ( i . e . , intensity ) , in accord with the circumplex model ( Watson & Tellegen , 1999 ) . The circumplex model represents different affective states ( e . g . , excited , happy , upset , tense ) , which are situated in a two - dimensional plane defined by plea - sure - displeasure and activation - deactivation axes . Elation , for instance , is a reflection of core affect that is both highly activated and pleasant . Such affects are elementary because they usu - ally occur without effortful cognitive interven - tion , and they are experienced regardless of in - dividual , contextual , and cultural differences 528 July Academy of Management Review ( Russell & Barrett , 1999 ) . Individuals vary in the degree to which they characterize the valence and intensity of their affective experiences . External stimuli such as objects , activities , and contexts are imbued with affective quality . When individuals interact with the external en - vironment , they perceive these external stimuli to hold more or less affective quality ( e . g . , bor - ing , exciting ) . While perception of affective quality is an elemental process that is individ - ually dependent , to perceive affective quality is to assess external stimuli that may or may not invoke any affect . Nevertheless , core affect and affective quality are linked in complex ways , and a stimulus’s affective quality holds the “ca - pacity to change core affect” ( Russell , 2003 : 149 ) . Key Elements of Experiences of Emotion Russell and Barrett ( 1999 ) note that experi - enced emotions may be conceptualized as pro - totypical episodes that involve four key ele - ments : ( 1 ) appraisals of the affective quality of one or more stimuli in the environment , ( 2 ) con - scious experience of changes in one’s core affect and attributions to antecedent stimuli , ( 3 ) overt action readiness or action directed toward or away from the stimuli , and ( 4 ) associated en - gagement of brain and body response tenden - cies for goal pursuit . When all four elements are present , Russell ( 2003 ) calls them exemplars of full - blown or blue - ribbon emotions such as fear and elation . For instance , when an individual on a leisurely hike encounters a bear on a trail , the account of experienced emotion is as follows : the individual’s assessment of the bear ( stimu - lus ) indicates a danger ( appraisal ) , triggering a change in core affect from pleasant to unpleas - ant ( attribution ) , followed by an overt behavioral response of flight ( action ) and associated alert - ness , sweating , and increased effort directed at reducing danger ( goal pursuit ) . The first two el - ements , involving the association of external stimuli with changes in core affect through an attributional process , usually are viewed as a core aspect of emotion and are referred to as attributed affect . We do not deny that one can experience affect without any attributions to ex - ternal stimuli ( e . g . , moods ) . However , such af - fects are less relevant in our context . While appraisals , attributions , attributed af - fect , and action engagement are often cogni - tively mediated processes , learning can short - circuit cognitions , resulting in effortless and automatic behavioral responses that take split seconds ( Dolan , 2002 ) . In this case the experi - ence of emotion may occur as automatic affect , as if subconsciously programmed ( Baumeister , Vohs , DeWall , & Zhang , 2007 ) . In other cases appraisal of the threats and opportunities posed by novel stimuli may be needed before an overt response or plan for such response is developed . A particularly relevant novel stimulus is feed - back from goal - directed behaviors . As individu - als execute behaviors in pursuit of goals , they may encounter unforeseen impediments or op - portunities that invoke affect . Russell and Bar - rett ( 1999 ) view these encounters as episodes of emotional experiences , since they are triggered by environmental stimuli , dissipate once the in - dividuals’ behavioral response facilitates cop - ing , and hence have a beginning and an end . Neurobiological studies provide initial data in support of the preceding view of emotional ex - periences ( Dolan , 2002 ; Noel , Van der Linden , & Bechara , 2006 ) . Evidence suggests that the amygdala—a group of neurons located deep in the brain—plays a critical role in linking the external stimulus to the individual’s affective state . The amygdala is involved in detecting the salience and relevance of the stimulus and in activating visceral motor structures , such as the hypothalamus and autonomic brainstem nuclei , that produce systematic changes in facial ex - pression and bodily responses usually condi - tioned by instinctive , social , or cultural learning factors . Researchers characterize the patterned response involved in an emotional episode as a “reactive system” to recognize that it is acti - vated in reaction to external stimuli . Russell notes that there is “no neural circuit , peptide or other biological marker” ( 2003 : 151 ) that is unique to any specific affective state . Individuals construct the meaning of novel ex - periences using a psychological process of cat - egorization , which involves determining the ex - perience’s resemblance to stored mental representations of prototypical instances of emotion . The mental representations are usu - ally based on culturally shared concepts , and the categorization is thought to occur via online processing as individuals become conscious of their emotional experiences ( Barrett et al . , 2007 ) . Researchers believe that , in so doing , individu - als provide coherence to the diverse elements that make up their emotional experiences . 2009 529 Cardon , Wincent , Singh , and Drnovsek Feelings and Experiences of Emotion Feelings are defined in many different ways ( Damasio , 2003 ) . To identify a workable defini - tion for our study , we drew from neurobiology research that provides a physiological basis for defining feelings as a conscious experience of changes in one’s core affect that is attributed to external stimuli ( like attributed affect ) but that engages additional resources for processing , storing , and retrieval on demand . Not all emo - tional experiences are salient . Changes in core affect that are less salient are less likely to elicit reflection ( of the experience’s meaning ) and in - tegration ( with past experiences ) . When objects or activities involved in emotional experiences are central to an individual’s self - identity , effort - ful reflection on the current experience is likely followed by its integration with past experi - ences . Such integration is object specific and may be viewed as a network of nodes and link - ages in which the experienced and categorized feeling is a key node and is linked to cognitions , motivation , and action tendencies that are tagged by the focal identity associated with the emotional experience ( Schwarz & Clore , 2007 ) . As such , salient experiences of emotion strengthen and update the encoding associated with the focal identity . When stored mental representations of feel - ings have been effortfully encoded and updated , they are easier to retrieve when needed . The process is individualized and idiosyncratic , leading neurobiologists to view feelings as a “reflective system” that stores accounts of indi - viduals’ reflections on experiences of emotion ( Noel et al . , 2006 ) . Moreover , while feelings can be stirred , activated , or amplified by direct en - gagement with stimuli , that is not necessary . Feelings can be retrieved as cohesive mental constructions , complete with their network of linkages , long after the antecedent stimuli has ended or receded from the environment . A par - ticularly relevant retrieval process involves an - ticipatory feelings ( Baumeister et al . , 2007 ) . Peo - ple may imagine , desire , dream , or long for engagement in activities involving a focal iden - tity and , in so doing , consciously experience the associated feeling stored from past experiences . Because of their identity salience and their ease of retrieval , anticipatory feelings can produce relatively enduring behavioral engagement . REFERENCES Amabile , T . M . 1997 .
