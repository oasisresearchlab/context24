This study determined overall intention to receive a COVID - 19 vaccine and identified 37 factors that predict intentions to be vaccinated against COVID - 19 in Canada . 38 39 Methods : Individuals from research cohorts from the general population of British Columbia 40 aged 25 - 69 were invited complete an online survey based on validated scales and theoretical 41 frameworks to explore intention to receive a COVID - 19 vaccine . Two multivariable logistic 42 regression models were conducted to determine factors associated with intention to receive the 43 COVID - 19 vaccine . 44 45 Results : Of 4 , 528 respondents , 79 . 8 % intended to receive a COVID - 19 vaccine . In 46 multivariable modeling , respondents who intended to receive the vaccine had higher vaccine 47 attitudinal scores ( p < 0 . 001 ) , reported greater influence of direct social norms ( p = 0 . 001 ) , and 48 indirect social norms , including their family physician ( p = 0 . 024 ) , and Provincial Health Officer 49 ( p = 0 . 011 ) . Older individuals ( > 60 years ) were more likely to intend to receive the vaccine , 50 while females ( 95 % CI 0 . 57 , 0 . 93 ) , those with less than high school education ( 95 % CI 0 . 5 , 0 . 76 ) , 51 those who self - identified as non - white ( 95 % CI 0 . 60 , 0 . 92 ) , self - identified as Indigenous ( 95 % CI 52 0 . 36 , 0 . 84 ) and essential non - health care workers ( 95 % CI 0 . 59 , 0 . 86 ) had lower adjusted odds of 53 intending to receive a COVID - 19 vaccine . 54 55 Conclusions : To optimize vaccine coverage , public health should focus on key messages 56 around vaccine safety and benefit , and leverage trusted practitioners for messaging .

In Canada , the National Advisory Committee on Immunization ( NACI ) has identified 74 priority populations for initial vaccine roll - out , including populations at high risk for severe 75 COVID - 19 related illness ; those most likely to transmit COVID - 19 to those at high risk ; those 76 essential to maintaining the COVID - 19 response ; those who contribute to the maintenance of 77 essential services ; and those living or working in conditions that put them at higher risk for 78 infection . 7 79 80 Ultimately , the success of any COVID - 19 vaccine program depends upon vaccine uptake in the 81 population . Over the past decade there has been a significant rise in “vaccine hesitancy” , a 82 complex concept defined as the refusal , reluctance , or delay in acceptance to vaccinate despite 83 vaccine availability 2 , 8 , 9 , which has led to decreases in vaccine uptake . 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 Understanding the 84 predictors and determinants influencing intentions to receive a COVID - 19 vaccine in Canada 85 are key to designing public health programming to optimize vaccination rates , including among 86 priority populations , when vaccine is available broadly . 6 , 7 When evaluating vaccine intention , 87 assessments should be based on validated theoretical frameworks in order to provide robust 88 information for program planning . Using a survey based on the WHO Vaccine Hesitancy Scale 89 ( VHS ) and grounded in the Theory of Planned Behaviour ( TPB ) , the primary objective of this 90 study was to determine the intention to receive a COVID - 19 vaccine among people living in 91 .

Eligible 102 individuals ( aged 25 - 69 ; resident of BC ) were sent an email invitation to participate ( Index 103 Participants ) in an online survey . To increase diverse sex and gender representation , 104 respondents were asked to provide the email address of an adult household member who 105 identified as another gender to participate in the survey – these individuals were then invited to 106 participate in the online survey ( Household Participants ) . All prospective participants received 107 up to three email reminders , and an opportunity to participate in a draw for a gift card . 108 Participants could also opt - in to receive an at - home SARS - CoV - 2 research antibody test ( data 109 collection ongoing and will be reported separately ) . Ethical approval was received from The 110 University of British Columbia Research Ethics Board ( H20 - 01421 ) . 111 112 Survey Design and Measures 113 To determine the factors associated with intention to be vaccinated , existing items came from 114 the validated WHO VHS 9 and new items were developed using TPB framework . 15 TPB is a 115 psychological model of behavior change that has been used widely to predict and understand 116 health - related behaviours and has been shown previously to accurately predict vaccine uptake 117 in Canada . 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 TPB defines the most significant predictors of a health behaviour as 118 attitudes , social norms ( direct , indirect ) , and perceived behavioural controls . 15 For this survey , 119 .

The survey assessed vaccine attitudes ( 8 items ) , direct social norms ( 4 items ) , indirect 122 social norms ( 14 items ) , and perceived behavioural controls ( 4 items ) ( Appendix B ) . Vaccine 123 hesitancy was measured using the validated 9 - item , 2 - factor VHS initially developed by the 124 WHO Sage Working Group on Vaccine Hesitancy 8 , 9 , 12 , and adapted for BC . The factors included 125 in VHS are vaccine lack of confidence ( 7 items ) and vaccine risk ( 2 items ) . 8 All items in TPB 126 and VHS scales were measured on a 5 - point Likert scale . The overall survey was assessed for 127 face validity and comprehension , pilot tested , and the final version was implemented using 128 REDCap ( Research Electronic Data Capture ) . 21 129 For each participant the following demographic characteristics were assessed : age , sex , 130 gender , Indigenous ancestry , visible minority status , education , household composition , existing 131 chronic health condition , self - reported history of COVID - 19 , and self - reported employment as an 132 essential worker . Visible minority categories were based on the Statistics Canada 2016 census . 133 The primary outcome was response to “ If a COVID - 19 vaccine were to become available to the 134 public , and recommended for you , how likely are you to receive it ? ” 135 136 Survey response rate 137 Response rate was calculated according to the American Association for Public Opinion 138 Research ( AAPOR ) guidelines for Internet Surveys of Specifically Named Persons . 22 Response 139 rate is defined as the sum of complete ( 100 % of applicable questions answered ) and partial 140 surveys ( < 100 % of applicable questions answered ) , divided by the overall number of invitations 141 distributed to eligible respondents . Participant disposition is defined as : respondents ( number of 142 complete and partial surveys ) , ineligible ( those who did not meet the eligibility criteria ) , invitation 143 returned undelivered ( number of emails bounced back ) , explicit refusals ( those who replied that 144 .

Item reliability for TPB scales was assessed using Cronbach’s α , and if α > 0 . 6 ( good 153 agreement ) , scales were included in bivariable and multivariable analysis . For the primary 154 outcome ( intention to receive a COVID - 19 vaccine ) responses on the 5 - point Likert scale were 155 dichotomized , with those who responded very or somewhat likely coded as “intending to 156 vaccinate” and those who responses neutral , unlikely , or very unlikely coded as “not intending to 157 vaccinate” . We investigated the relationship between intention to get a COVID - 19 vaccine and 158 demographic and vaccine specific variables using mixed - effects logistic regressions . To allow 159 participants to select more than one visible minority category , visible minority variables were 160 coded as those who indicated a particular minority status vs . those who did not , and used as 161 separate variables in analyses . Intention to vaccinate was examined in priority groups identified 162 by NACI , including older ( > 60 ) , those with chronic health conditions , visible minorities , 163 Indigenous participants , healthcare workers , and essential workers . 7 Two multivariable mixed - 164 effects logistic regression models were conducted to explore factors associated with the 165 dependent variable ‘ intention to receive a COVID - 19 vaccine’ . One model examined 166 demographic variables , and the other model included the VHS and TPB items . For both models , 167 a priori predictors of vaccine intention which achieved a p < 0 . 1 from bivariable analysis were 168 included in multivariable models , and adjusted odds ratios were calculated to identify factors 169 .

Case - wise deletion was used to 170 address missing data within each bivariable analysis . Multivariable analyses included only non - 171 missing data . Clustering by household was accounted for in the mixed - effects models using a 172 random effect for household ID . A descriptive analysis of male versus female respondents was 173 completed for the WHO VHS scale and the TPB framework . 174 .

Of the 1291 178 invites that were forwarded to prospective Household Participants , 656 responded . Overall , 179 4 , 058 surveys were completed and 890 were partially completed by eligible participants , for a 180 response rate of 32 . 9 % ( 4 , 948 / 15 , 055 ) overall ( including all who were sent the survey ) , and 181 37 . 2 % ( 4 , 948 / 13 , 299 ) ( including only those who received the survey ) . We compared the ages 182 of survey respondents and non - respondents ( those who declined participation or did not 183 respond ) across five age strata ( 25 - 30 ; 30 - 40 ; 40 - 50 ; 50 - 60 ; 60 - 70 ) . We found no significant 184 differences between the ages of respondents and non - respondents , indicating 185 representativeness of our sample based on age ( data not shown ) . 186 187 Demographics 188 Survey respondents had a mean age of 51 . 8 ( SD = 10 . 5 ) with a range from 25 - 69 years ( Table 189 1 ) . The majority of participants self - reported being assigned female sex at birth ( 84 . 8 % ) , 190 identified as women ( 84 . 1 % ) , white ( 82 . 6 % ) , and had more than a high school education 191 ( 83 . 8 % ) . Fifty - two participants ( 1 . 1 % ) identified as non - binary , GenderQueer , Agender , Two - 192 Spirit , or other gender identity . Visible minority responses were grouped into broader categories 193 for analyses . Essential health care workers comprised 12 . 0 % of respondents and essential non - 194 healthcare workers comprised 18 . 4 % . Survey respondents were from all five health authorities 195 in BC . 196 197 Intention to receive a COVID - 19 vaccine 198 .

Among 200 essential health care workers , 81 . 8 % indicated that they intend to receive a COVID - 19 vaccine . 201 In bivariable analyses , those who were older ( > 60 years ) , males , had chronic health conditions , 202 were essential health care workers , had more than a high school education , or had two adults in 203 the house were significantly more likely to intend to receive the COVID - 19 vaccine ( p≤0 . 05 ) . 204 Individuals who were essential non - health care workers , identified as non - white , South Asian or 205 of Indigenous ancestry were significantly less likely to intend to receive vaccination ( p≤0 . 05 ) . 206 Given there were only 52 non - binary , GenderQueer , Agender , or Two - spirit respondents , sex , 207 not gender , was used in the model . In multivariable modeling , individuals who were older ( > 60 208 years ) were more likely to intend to receive the COVID - 19 vaccine ( Table 2 ) , while females 209 ( AOR 0 . 7 ; 95 % CI 0 . 55 , 0 . 89 ) ; those who had less than a high school education ( AOR 0 . 62 ; 210 95 % CI 0 . 51 , 0 . 77 ) ; those who self - identified as non - white ( AOR 0 . 76 ; 95 % CI 0 . 61 , 0 . 95 ) ; those 211 who self - identified as Indigenous ( AOR 0 . 58 ; 95 % CI 0 . 38 , 0 . 87 ) ; those who were essential non - 212 health care workers ( AOR 0 . 72 ; 95 % CI 0 . 6 , 0 . 87 ) ; and those who thought they had COVID - 19 213 ( AOR 0 . 76 ; 95 % 0 . 61 – 0 . 96 ) had lower adjusted odds of intending to receive a COVID - 19 214 vaccine if it were publicly available and recommended for them . 215 216 Vaccine Hesitancy Scale and Theory of Planned Behaviour 217 All items in the TPB scale had good to strong agreement ( Cronbach’s alpha > 0 . 6 ) and were 218 included in the analysis ( Table 3 ) . A descriptive analysis of male ( n = 605 ) versus female ( n = 219 4 , 178 ) respondents was completed for the TPB scale and the WHO VHS scale ( Table 4 ) . In 220 bivariable modeling , all responses in the WHO and TPB scales were significantly different in 221 individuals who intended to be vaccinated and those who did not , and were included in the 222 multivariable analysis ( Table 2 ) . In multivariable modeling ( Table 2 ) , participants who had higher 223 .

In the TPB scales , respondents who intended to vaccinate had 225 significantly higher vaccine attitudinal scores ( p < 0 . 001 ) , reported greater influence of direct 226 social norms on their decision to vaccinate , including belief that most people who are important 227 to them would think they should receive the COVID - 19 vaccine , and would expect them to 228 receive the vaccine ( p < 0 . 001 ) . Participants intending to be vaccinated were also significantly 229 more likely to report greater influence of indirect social norms , including the opinions of family ( p 230 < 0 . 001 ) , their family physician or primary healthcare provider ( p = 0 . 03 ) , and the Provincial 231 Health Officer ( p = 0 . 01 ) . Perceived behavioural controls and the influence of friends ( indirect 232 social norm ) were not found to be predictors of intention to vaccinate . 233 .

In multivariable modeling , older individuals ( > 60 years ) were 238 more likely to intend to receive the COVID - 19 vaccine . However , other key populations including 239 essential non - health care workers , those who identified as non - white or Indigenous , as well as 240 those with less than high school education indicated that they are less likely to intend to receive 241 a COVID - 19 vaccine . From the WHO and TPB scales , we found that those who report higher 242 lack of confidence in vaccines and higher perceived risk of vaccines were less likely to indicate 243 an intention to vaccinate . As well , overall attitudes to vaccines and social norms were significant 244 predictors of intention to receive a COVID - 19 vaccine . When we adjusted the multivariable 245 models for sex , only negligible changes were observed in the results ( data not shown ) . 246 Understanding population - level intention to receive the COVID - 19 vaccine is critical to success 247 of COVID - 19 vaccination programs and ultimately COVID - 19 pandemic control . 2 248 249 The study findings are consistent with results from unpublished polls in Canada investigating 250 COVID - 19 vaccine intention , which have found that the majority of Canadians intend to get a 251 COVID - 19 vaccine when it becomes available . 2 , 25 , 26 However , our findings contrast polls from 252 the United States and the UK , which indicate that 57 . 6 % and 53 % of the population in those 253 countries respectively intended to be vaccinated against COVID - 19 27 , 28 254 255 Results from the WHO VHS and the TPB scales provide important insights to guide public 256 health programming ( Table 2 ) . Specifically , to instill confidence in COVID - 19 vaccines , 257 messaging should focus on the benefit of vaccines , including their impact on society overall and 258 .

Information on vaccine safety from 259 vaccine trials , as well as plans for ongoing , transparent monitoring and reporting of side effects 260 of COVID - 19 vaccines should be broadly shared to strengthen public confidence . As our 261 findings show that family physicians and Provincial Public Health Officers are influential in 262 vaccine decision making , public health leadership needs to utilize their influence to optimize 263 COVID - 19 vaccine coverage . 264 265 Leading health authorities , such as the WHO , have identified the need to ensure that everyone 266 is protected by full immunization regardless of socioeconomic and gender - related barriers . 29 267 While findings from our study indicate older individuals are more likely to plan to receive the 268 vaccine , in both the overall and priority populations identified by NACI , intention to vaccinate is 269 not close to 100 % , indicating that strong vaccine messaging is still needed . In addition , key 270 populations , including essential non - health care workers ; non - white and Indigenous populations 271 are less likely to intend to receive the vaccine . Public health leaders need to work specifically 272 with these communities , to better understand their concerns and build confidence and trust in 273 the vaccine program . 274 275 Additional Canada - wide research is needed to understand vaccine intentions , to determine if 276 vaccine intentions vary by province . Future research investigating COVID - 19 vaccine intentions 277 should continue to incorporate validated scales and established theoretical frameworks like the 278 VHS and TPB , rather than relying on unvalidated online polls . 279 280 .

To our knowledge , this is the first study that has drawn from a large 294 provincial sample in Canada , using established and rigorous theoretical frameworks to 295 investigate intention to receive a COVID - 19 vaccine . 296 .
