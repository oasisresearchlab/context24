In addition , they contribute both to tumor development and tumor progression . We reported previously that strong cytoplasmic ezrin expression was independently associated with poorer patient survival . One hundred and thirty - one histologically conﬁrmed primary head and neck squamous cell carcinomas were examined prospectively for cancer progression and survival at a large health care center in the Bronx , NY , USA . Immunohisto - chemical analysis of ezrin , moesin , merlin , and willin expression in tissue microarray samples of primary head and neck squamous cell carcinoma revealed a signiﬁcant association of increased cytoplasmic ezrin with poor cancer survival . Global RNA analyses suggest that cancers with high cytoplasmic ezrin have a more invasive phenotype . This study supports our previous ﬁndings associating cytoplasmic ezrin with more aggressive behavior and poorer outcome and indicates the need for a multi - institu - tional study to validate the use of cytoplasmic ezrin as a biomarker for treatment planning in head and neck squa - mous cell carcinoma .

Moesin is a member of the 4 . 1 superfamily of proteins which are identiﬁed by the presence of a 4 . 1 ezrin , radixin moesin ( FERM ) domain which can bind both pro - teins and lipids , and as such , they can function in many normal physiologic processes including cell shape and motility , proliferation and development . In some cases , this family of proteins directly link transmembrane proteins to the cytoskeleton or link kinase and / or phosphatase enzy - matic activity to the plasma membrane . Speciﬁcally , they have now been shown to be involved in the control of several different signal transduction pathways , including RhoA , Hedgehog , membrane receptor ( e . g . Patched , CD43 or CD44 ) signalling ( reviewed in [ 3 ] ) and , more recently , Hippo pathway signalling [ 4 – 6 ] . In addition to the many binding partners and multiple pathways they control , FERM proteins themselves can be controlled by post - translational modiﬁcation , such as phosphorylation , and are differentially expressed in normal murine and human tissues [ 7 , 8 ] . Altered expression of a subset of 4 . 1 family proteins is believed to contribute to carcinogenesis and metastasis , as exempliﬁed by the following : merlin has been shown to function as a tumor suppressor [ 9 ] ; ezrin is believed to play a role in the development of metastasis [ 10 , 11 ] ; moesin has been implicated in oral squamous cell carcinomas [ 12 – 14 ] ; and willin has been shown to antagonize some of the functions of the YAP oncogene [ 6 ] . We have shown previously that a high level of cytoplasmic ezrin correlates or that high levels of cytoplasmic ezrin correlate with poor survival in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma [ 15 ] , and recent studies show that increased expression of ezrin is also associated with poor clinical outcome in a variety of human cancers [ 16 – 21 ] . In this study , we compare the protein expression of four members of the 4 . 1 . superfamily : ezrin , moesin , merlin , and willin in primary HNSCC and relate the expression of these cytoplasmic proteins with clinical outcome in a prospective cohort of HNSCC patients . We ﬁnd that high levels of ezrin and moesin expression are associated with poor cancer survival . Subsequent analyses of global RNA expression suggest that a complex interaction of multiple signaling pathways may be driving the observed progres - sion to poorer clinical outcomes . Materials and Methods Study Design This project followed an Institution Review Board approved protocol and is HIPPA - compliant . This cohort consisted of 131 consecutive , prospectively collected pri - mary HNSCC from 128 patients treated at Monteﬁore Medical Center ( MMC ) from 2002 onward . Demographic data , detailed smoking and alcohol information , treatment details , and follow - up data were collected prospectively and entered into a clinical database . Snap frozen samples from the primary carcinoma , and adjacent mucosa were collected at initial diagnosis and treatment . Extracted RNA from these samples was used for global expression analy - sis . The corresponding matched formalin - ﬁxed parafﬁn embedded ( FFPE ) tumor samples were retrieved from the pathology ﬁles from primary tumor and adjacent mucosa and used to produce tissue microarrays ( TMA ) . Tissue Microarray Analysis Tissue microarray blocks were constructed from FFPE tissue using a semi - automatic tissue arrayer ( Chemicon ) and 1 . 0 mm cores , which were represented by three or more cores from the areas of interest . Microarray sections were deparafﬁnized , rehydrated , and washed in TBS ( SIGMA tris buffer , T6664 ) . Slides were pretreated with 0 . 3 % H 2 O 2 for 10 min , ( or DAKO s2001 ) and washed in TBS . Antigen retrieval was performed using pH 6 . 0 10 mM sodium citrate buffer ( Vector , H3300 ) in a steamer for 20 min , then cooled for 30 min at RT . Slides were blocked in 5 % normal goat serum / 2 % BSA for 1 h at RT before incubating with the following antibodies : ezrin ( 1 / 100 , Neomarkers , 3C12 ) , willin ( 1 / 100 gift from FGM ) , merlin ( 1 / 100 , NF - 2 , Santa Cruz , sc331 ) , and moesin ( 1 / 400 , Neomarkers , 3837 ) overnight at 4 (cid:3) C diluted in blocking solution . Slides were washed 4 times , 3 min each with TBS before applying biotin labeled sec - ondary antibody ( goat anti - mouse DAKO , E0433 ( ezrin , moesin ) and goat anti - rabbit DAKO , E0432 ( willin , merlin ) ) at 1 / 500 for 1 h at RT . Slides were washed and incubated for 30 min with the avidin – biotin – HRP complex as directed by DAKO ( ABC - HRP K0355 ) . Slides were washed in TBS and DAB ( VECTOR , SK 4100 ) applied for 3 min ( merlin ) and 1 . 5 min ( ezrin , willin , moesin ) . Two pathologists ( MBG , DB ) , blinded to outcome and tissue source , read the microarrays , and achieved a con - sensus regarding staining pattern and intensity . The level of staining intensity was recorded for the nucleus , cytoplasm , and the cell membrane . Level of expression was scored according to the strongest intensity that comprised at least 10 % of each core on a scale of 0 to 3 . Mean staining scores were then calculated across multiple core replicates from the same primary tumor biopsy or resection specimen and by cell location ( cytoplasm , nucleus and membrane ) . Global RNA Expression In an initial attempt to characterize the tumor pheno - type ( s ) associated with cytoplasmic ezrin expression in HNSCC , we performed whole genome expression analyses on 74 fresh , frozen primary HNSCC tumor samples ( 10 with Head and Neck Pathol ( 2012 ) 6 : 232 – 243 233 123 high cytoplasmic ezrin and 64 low cytoplasmic ezrin expression as previously determined by IHC in the corre - sponding FFPE samples ) . Total RNA was prepared using TRIzol [ 22 ] . For each RNA sample , linear ampliﬁcation and biotin - labeling of total RNA ( 500 ng ) was carried out using the Illumina TotalPrep RNA Ampliﬁcation Kit ( Ambion ) . Whole - genome expression analysis was carried out by hybridization of ampliﬁed RNA to an Illumina HumanHT - 12 v3 Expression BeadChip . With this beadchip , we inter - rogated greater than 48 , 000 probes per sample ; targeting genes and known alternative splice variants from the RefSeq database release 17 and UniGene build 188 . Controls for each RNA sample ( greater than 1 , 000 bead types ) conﬁrmed sample RNA quality , labeling reaction success , hybridiza - tion stringency , and signal generation . The raw data were normalized using quantile – quantile normalization . Even though our samples had low background levels , to minimize the probability of spurious noise generating a false positive , we chose to process the data by requiring a selected feature to have expression levels greater than the 4th quartile of the samples designated background probes in at least 30 % of the samples . This reduced our feature set to 9719 elements . Normalized RNA expression data were log 2 - transformed and a two - tailed t test was performed for each feature . Statistical Analyses Contingency tables were generated between high and low ezrin , moesin , willin , and merlin expression and gender , age , race , tumor site , smoking , AJCC TNM stage , nodal status at diagnosis and history of prior primaries . For efﬁciency and purposes of statistical validation , cases were classiﬁed as having strong to weak or no expression based on our previous ﬁndings on an earlier population of HNSCC patients [ 15 ] . Tumors with strong cytoplasmic ezrin expression , deﬁned as having C 2 . 5 mean staining , were classiﬁed as positive . Due to smaller numbers of ? 3 cytoplasmic staining tumors with moesin , willin , and merlin , positive expression for these were based on a ? 2 cut - off . Various cut - offs ( e . g . , [ 0 , C 1 and C 1 . 5 ) were also tested for membranous and nuclear expression . Differences in expression with respect to clinical and demographic characteristics at diagnosis were assessed by two - tailed Chi - square or Fisher exact tests . Time to clinical outcome event was measured from treatment start to the ﬁrst instance of a local or regional recurrence ( LRR ) or distant metastases and cancer death , or to the last recorded follow - up visit date for censored subjects . Survival curves were estimated using Kaplan – Meier analyses . Cumulative probability ( i . e . , 1 - survival function ) curves for disease progression were generated based on ﬁrst incidence of LRR or distant metastasis . We estimated the relative hazard ( HR ) of each outcome of interest for cytoplasmic ezrin , moesin , willin , and merlin expression by multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression . The potential for confounding was examined for all clinicopathologic factors : age , gender , race , ethnicity , smoking history , alcohol consumption , tumor anatomic site , TNM stage , treatment modality , detection of human papillo - mavirus ( HPV ) , andmethodofspecimenprocurement ( biopsy vs . surgical orlaser resection ) . Presence ofHPV DNAandp16 expression in tumors were tested for a subset of cases using previously described protocols [ 23 ] ; tumors not tested were listed as unknown in the multivariable analyses . Empirical confounders were selected based on a ten percent change - in - estimate criterion [ 24 ] and subsequently controlled for in all models . We also conducted an exhaustive search for signiﬁ - cant predictors . The resulting ﬁnal multivariable regression models for disease - speciﬁc survival were stratiﬁed on tumor site , primary treatment , race , HPV , and specimen procure - ment method , and adjusted further for age , ethnicity , ever smoking status , alcohol drinking , prior primaries , and tumor stage . This allowed a different baseline hazard for each con - founder combination without violating proportional hazards assumptions . Proportional hazards assumptions were tested for all multivariable regression models and were not found to be violated . The FERM speciﬁc HRs for LRR and distant metastases were stratiﬁed on tumor site , primary treatment , race , and HPV , and adjusted further for age , ethnicity , ever smoking status , alcohol drinking , prior primaries , and tumor stage . Totestthenullhypothesisthattheregressioncoefﬁcient was equal to zero , p - values based on the Wald Chi - square test were computed . Interactions between FERM proteins , and by sub - cellular location , were also examined by generating a cross - product term between each paired combination . Associated Functional Analyses For selected RNA , data were analyzed through the use of Ingenuity Pathways Analysis ( Ingenuity (cid:4) Systems , www . ingenuity . com ) . The Functional Analysis of RNA identiﬁed the biological functions and / or diseases that were most sig - niﬁcant to the data set in Table 5 . Right - tailed Fisher’s exact test was used to calculate P values determining the probability that each biological function and / or disease assigned to that data set is due to chance alone . The functional analyses for selected processes related to cancer , proliferation , differenti - ation , invasion , and cell death are presented in Table 6 . Results Patient Cohort One hundred and thirty - one histologically conﬁrmed HNSCC primaries were examined from a total of 128 patients undergoing primary treatment at MMC . The mean 234 Head and Neck Pathol ( 2012 ) 6 : 232 – 243 123 age of the patients was 62 years ( ± 12 . 4 standard deviation ) with a range of 25 – 91 years . The majority of cases were male ( 70 % ) and smokers ( 82 % ; Table 1 ) . Mean follow - up time was 52 . 4 months ( for a cohort total of 6 , 866 months combined ) . During follow - up , 65 cases ( 54 % ) died after an average of 25 . 6 months following diagnosis , of which 22 ( 33 . 8 % ) were directly attributed to their cancer . Thirty - two cases ( 24 . 4 % ) developed a recurrence and / or distant metastasis following treatment after an average period of 16 . 5 months . Eighteen ( 14 % ) patients had a previous history of can - cer . History of prior primaries was adjusted for in all multivariable models . We also conducted sensitivity anal - yses excluding these cases ; no differences in association were observed after restriction . Expression of FERM Proteins Table 2 summarizes the mean expression patterns of the FERM proteins for this cohort . With respect to anatomic site , strong ezrin expression was observed more often in tumors of the pharynx although the difference was not signiﬁcant ( P = 0 . 689 ) , whereas strong cytoplasmic moe - sin ( P = 0 . 326 ) , willin ( P = 0 . 024 ) , and merlin ( P = 0 . 218 ) expression were found most often in oral cavity tumors . There were no signiﬁcant differences in FERM expression between advanced and lower TNM stage tumors , except for merlin , which was lower in metastatic tumors ( P = 0 . 037 ; Table 3 ) . Somewhat higher cytoplas - mic ezrin expression was observed in tumors from younger patients ( P = 0 . 092 ; Fig . 1 histology photomic ) , and lower cytoplasmic willin expression was detected among HPV positive tumors ( P = 0 . 011 ) . Assessment of 5 year cancer survival by Kaplan – Meier univariate analyses showed signiﬁcant positive ( risk ) associations with strong cytoplasmic ( C 2 . 5 ) ezrin ( log rank P = 0 . 0048 ; Fig . 2 ) .

243 123 suggested for LRR and incidence of distant metastases with increased cytoplasmic ( C 2 ) moesin expression , although this was not signiﬁcant ( log rank P = 0 . 0713 ; Fig . 3 ) . Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that strong cytoplasmic ezrin expression was signiﬁcantly associated with a four - fold increased likelihood of cancer death ( Table 4 ) . In addition , we observed signiﬁcantly higher hazards for combined cytoplasmic ezrin and moesin expression ( adjusted HR for disease - speciﬁc survival = 6 . 9 [ 95 % CI 2 . 2 – 20 . 8 ] and HR for LRR or distant metasta - sis = 2 . 7 [ 95 % CI 1 . 1 – 6 . 3 ] ) . In contrast , cytoplasmic merlin and willin expression were not associated with cancer sur - vival or disease progression . With respect to non - cytoplas - mic expression , no signiﬁcant associations were observed , although inverse associations with increased ( C 2 ) willin , and merlin nuclear expression were suggested for overall and cancer mortality , and disease progression ( not shown ) . RNA Expression in HNSCC with High Cytoplasmic Ezrin Given the exploratory nature of these analyses , we did not correct for multiple comparisons . Nonetheless , we identiﬁed 842 features that had a P value less than 0 . 05 and 152 features that had a P value less than 0 . 005 . In Table 5 , we present median values of non - transformed data for biologically rel - evant genes , the ratio of the median between cancers expressing high versus low cytoplasmic ezrin and the p - value derived from the log 2 - transformed data . Because we routinely perform global RNA analysis of primary HNSCC samples , we could analyze expression to correlate biologically signiﬁcant differences in expression between cancers expressing high versus low cytoplasmic ezrin ( Tables 5 , 6 ) . We analyzed genes based on differ - ential expression in high versus low cytoplasmic ezrin cancers . A subset of genes with known biologic relevance to cancer that had statistically signiﬁcant levels of expression in high versus low cytoplasmic ezrin cancers were analyzed using IPA software focusing on prolifera - tion , epithelial differentiation , invasion , and cell death . Many genes were found in several functional categories ( Tables 5 , 6 ) . The functional categorization of high cyto - plasmic ezrin cancers favors gene expression patterns featuring a more invasive phenotype ( P \ 5 . 47E - 08 ) , inhibition of cell death ( P \ 1 . 54E - 10 ) , dampening of proliferation ( P \ 4 . 71E - 10 ) , decreased differentiation Fig . 1 Cytoplasmic ezrin . a Ezrin expression in normal squamous mucosa .

Prominent membrane localization is accentuated in the interior of the cell group , recapitulating the stratiﬁcation of normal epithelium . c Squamous cell carcinoma demonstrating moderate ( ? 2 ) cytoplasmic ezrin expres - sion , with reduced membrane localization . d Squamous cell carcinoma demonstrating strong ( ? 3 ) cytoplasmic ezrin expression . Many cells have intensely staining cytoplasmic ﬁlaments , while membrane localization is minimal . Two pathologists ( MBG , DB ) , blinded to outcome and tissue source , read the microarrays and achieved a consensus regarding staining pattern and intensity . The level of cytoplasmic staining was scored according to the strongest intensity that comprised at least 10 % of each core on a scale of 0 – 3 . Mean staining scores were then calculated across multiple core replicates from the same primary tumor biopsy or resection specimen Head and Neck Pathol ( 2012 ) 6 : 232 – 243 237 123 ( P , 1 . 01E - 07 ) , and expression of cancer - associated genes ( P \ 1 . 80E - 04 ) , which is all consistent with poorer cancer survival . Discussion Members of the FERM family of proteins contribute to diverse physiologic functions through multiple signaling pathways [ 3 ] . We have shown previously that moesin , willin , and ezrin are expressed in the normal human oral mucosa as the cells differentiate [ 15 ] . In addition we showed that the abnormal localization of ezrin in the cytoplasm of HNSCC cells correlates with poor overall survival [ 15 ] . While the mechanism for cytoplasmic localization is unknown and whether cytoplasmic ezrin contributes to aggressive phenotype or is merely a bio - marker for it , there is mounting evidence that expression of ezrin in several types of tumors correlates with poor out - come [ 16 – 21 ] . In an attempt to understand the relationship of cyto - plasmic ezrin with aggressive cancer phenotype , we looked for correlations with RNA expression . While there are several potential interpretations of the data , we favor the pattern of gene expression for dampening of proliferation for the following several reasons : ( 1 ) genes associated with cell division are relatively low ( KIF2C , CDT1 , E2F2 ) ; ( 2 ) certain genes induce a nonproliferative state ( TGFBR2 ) [ 25 ] or block internalization of EGFR ( RAB11FIP2 ) [ 26 ] , which favors motility over proliferation [ 27 , 28 ] ; and ( 3 ) increased phosphatase expression that can modulate path - way activation ( PTPRK ) [ 29 ] . With increased expression of MAP2K1 and RAF1 and decreased expression of PITX1 , ISG15 , CEBPA , MKNK2 and SOX2 [ 30 – 34 ] , we believe that the phosphatases are particularly interesting because they serve to inactivate kinase cascades [ 35 , 36 ] and can modulate pathway interaction , such as EGF and TGF - beta [ 29 ] . In addition , Notch1 , which has been recently identiﬁed as a tumor suppressor for SCC , is decreased in high cytoplasmic ezrin tumors and may dampen kinase activity [ 37 – 39 ] . The pattern of gene expression in high cytoplasmic ezrin cancers supports an invasive phenotype . There is increased expression of genes driving migration and invasion ( SERPINE2 , EFNB2 , ETS1 , NET1 , ITGB1 ) [ 40 – 42 ] , and a decrease in differentiation associated genes that are required for epidermal development ( e . g . tight junctions ) ( CLDN7 , CRB3 , DHCR24 , CNN2 ) [ 43 – 45 ] . Finally , the Fig . 2 Order of graphs clockwise from top left : a Ezrin expression ; b Moesin expression , c Willin expression , and d Merlin expression .

Censored cases shown by tick marks at last recorded follow - up 238 Head and Neck Pathol ( 2012 ) 6 : 232 – 243 123 pattern of gene expression in high cytoplasmic ezrin sup - ports survival rather than cell death because of increased expression of anti - apoptotic genes ( BIRC2 , CCDC50 , TGM2 ) [ 46 , 47 ] , decreased expression of pro - apoptotic genes ( EDARADD ) that mediate apoptosis and increased expression of genes that modulate pro - apoptotic pathways [ 48 ] . Recent work by Gunn - Moore and colleagues [ 6 ] shows that the Hippo signaling pathway can be activated or blocked by FERM proteins ; willin and merlin lead to activation of the pathway while ezrin and moesin block activation . Activation results in a kinase cascade resulting in the phosphorylation of YAP which inactivates this transcription factor resulting in translocation to the cyto - plasm and apoptosis . Non - phosphorylated YAP results in the expression of genes that promote cellular proliferation and block apoptosis in some systems and promote apop - tosis in others [ 49 ] . We measured YAP and pYAP expression immunohistochemically in six total cases of high and low cytoplasmic ezrin cancers ; both types of Fig . 3 Order of graphs clockwise from top left : a Ezrin expression ; b Moesin expression , c Willin expression , and d Merlin expression .

Because the pattern of FERM protein expres - sion correlates clinical outcome with potential Hippo pathway activity—high cytoplasmic ezrin / moesin associ - ated with poor cancer survival—and because active YAP is present in the nucleus , we cannot rule out some component of the hHppo pathway involvement in HNSCC . We should note that despite using expert staining and evaluations , tests were performed on tissue microarrays , which do not reproduce exactly the clinical diagnostic setting . Although , multiple cores were selected by a pathologist for each tumor to reﬂect the diagnostic histo - pathology specimen , in a small percentage of cases results may differ for clinical tissue sections . Presently , TNM staging based on physical exam , imaging , and histopa - thology is used for initial treatment planning . Prognostic biomarkers that can distinguish aggressive phenotypes at initial diagnosis are needed . However , many potential biomarkers fail because appropriate conﬁrming studies are not performed [ 50 ] . Our initial study of cytoplasmic ezrin in an independent population of HNSCC patients published in 2006 indicated the need for an intermediate level assessment presented here . The present study warrants a larger scale multi - institutional trial to conﬁrm the use of FERM protein expression as prognostic biomarkers for HNSCC , and to test for site and treatment speciﬁc associ - ations , which was not possible due to the inherent hetero - geneity in management of HNSCC . In addition , our initial correlative ﬁndings with RNA expression provide new insight into the high cytoplasmic ezrin phenotype that will aid in future clinical studies as well as studies in model systems aimed at deﬁning pathophysiologic mechanisms .
