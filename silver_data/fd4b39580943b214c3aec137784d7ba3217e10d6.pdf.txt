Applying Technology in a Hybrid - Fashion to Create Dementia - Inclusive Community Spaces Elaine Czech elaine . czech @ bristol . ac . uk University of Bristol Bristol , UK ABSTRACT While there is currently no cure for dementia , socially prescribing activities can enhance wellbeing for people living with dementia ( PLWD ) . However , accessibility to such activities can be hindered by location , being unaware of activities , scheduling issues , or lack of interest in the specifc activity . The COVID - 19 pandemic further complicated accessibility and changed how coordinators of such programs thought about technology . This PhD research explores how technology can improve accessibility to community spaces and programs for PLWD and their informal carers . The frst study involved understanding how technology used for social programs changed during the pandemic and developing guidelines for how program coordinators and technologists can adapt and develop technology for disseminating social programs . The current study aims to discover what elements may be necessary for spaces and programs to feel accessible for PLWD and how these elements can be translated or manifested through technology .

Instead , medical pro - fessionals and those working for organizations that assist those living with dementia promote social and continued community en - gagement to slow the disease’s progression [ 40 ] . Social prescribing is now considered a non - medical intervention that links " clinical practice with activities and support services within [ a ] community " [ 13 ] . Some socially prescribed programs provide a cultural , histor - ical , or social service to people with dementia ( PLWD ) and their informal carers . Such activities are important for both PLWD and Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for proft or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the frst page .

While such programs for PLWD have been around for more than ffteen years , social prescribing was only implemented as a form of care in the UK in 2019 [ 14 ] . Technology has played a signifcant part in expanding the outreach and recognition of such programs . Technology helped Meet Me at MoMA ( The Museum of Modern Art in New York ) , one of the frst pioneering social programs for PLWD , achieve national recognition [ 33 ] and disseminate a Web - based manual for other museums to hold similar programs [ 35 ] . Since the COVID - 19 pandemic , the role of technology in social programs has only increased . Many organizations that provided in - person programs before the pandemic chose to adapt their programs to use technologies like videoconferencing . While some of the use of Zoom social programming has diminished since the need for lockdowns has ceased , many organizations have chosen to continue some form of virtual or online activities for disseminating social programs . While keeping some form of virtual or online provides an organization with program stability and fexibility should another pandemic happen , how to design and guarantee that such programs remain able to provide the same social benefts as in - person still requires further research . As of writing , HCI research related to the impact of the pandemic on online social interactions for not only those living with dementia but older adults in general [ 39 ] , is limited . Sin et al . [ 39 ] noted that even for those without cognitive impairments issues with access to digital devices and the requirement of technology to socialize can be detrimental . Mynatt et al . [ 31 ] researched how an in - person empowerment program for people with mild cognitive impairment was adapted to asynchronously online delivery . However , this had to evolve to include synchronous video calls over Zoom , and even with synchronous calls participants still required more facilitation to have meaningful interactions . Thus , there is still room to improve how social aspects of programs are designed for when the program is facilitated by technology . Additionally , before the pandemic , Dai and Mofatt [ 9 ] looked at how technology could support a reminiscence activity in a public library for carers and their loved ones with dementia . While the pandemic put a pause on thinking about designing technology to complement in - person activities , the world is perhaps reaching a point where once again , social activities for PLWD are being held in public spaces . Moreover , within HCI , there is little exploration into technology used by those with mild to moderate dementia diagno - sis . One exception is Dixon , Piper , and Lazar’s [ 12 ] exploration into how people living with mild to moderate dementia use technology for self - management . This research suggests that societal pressures ASSETS ’22 , October 23 – 26 , 2022 , Athens , Greece Czech afect how PLWD use technology to navigate interpersonal rela - tionships . This PhD project aims to build of these two examples by combining the knowledge gained during the pandemic to consider how to design technology that helps with the accessibility of public spaces and programs for people with mild or moderate dementia . The objectives of this PhD project are : • Identifying and highlighting the complexities related to de - signing social programs for PLWD . • Providing a design checklist to assist with developing tech - nology for disseminating social programs . • Providing a design checklist to assist with developing tech - nology so that social spaces , both virtual and in - person , feel inclusive of PLWD . • Designing a technological solution that creates a hybrid community space inclusive of PLWD . • Verifying items , on the checklists mentioned above , by im - plementing a technological solution in a community space . 2 RELATED WORKS 2 . 1 HCI and PLWD Overall , dementia and HCI research has helped us to understand what type of interactions and designs are appropriate for those afected by dementia [ 15 , 16 , 28 , 30 , 44 , 45 ] . Researchers have also advocated for approaches that allow the person living with demen - tia to have agency and express their personhood [ 4 , 15 , 26 , 28 ] . However , most of the work thus far has focused on those with moderate to late - stage dementia living in a care home . Hodge et al . [ 21 ] examined how a PLWD and their loved ones created new memories on public outings . Since they were in more advanced stages , the purpose of this research was to enrich the rela - tionships between the person living with dementia and their loved ones and not the interactions between participants and the public . In the past few years , researchers have focused on encompassing a broader societal perspective and working with more people with mild to moderate dementia [ 9 , 12 ] . Most recently , Dixon et al . [ 11 ] worked with those newly diag - nosed or in the early stages of dementia to understand the barriers they face when accessing information on the internet . They found that more work is needed to make the online experience accessible for PLWD so they do not need to rely on a proxy . However , as Ben - nett et al . [ 3 ] and Storer and Branham [ 29 ] have pointed out , there are potential pitfalls to pushing an independence narrative onto assistive technology . Storer and Branham [ 29 ] found that the desire for creating independence has caused assistive technology to follow an institutional framework in which power is removed from people in care and their carers . While Bennett et al . [ 3 ] proposes that as no human is truly independent , it would be more benefcial to design for interdependency and support mutual dependence on others and technology . However , little work has been done on designing for the interdependent relationships that involve a PLWD . 2 . 2 HCI and Social Programs Often social programs for PLWD involve art appreciation or mak - ing / crafting through an institution such as a museum or care home , although Kelson et al . [ 25 ] found that enjoyment of public art was also benefcial for PLWD . Their research suggests that social pre - scribing does not need to occur within an institutional setting and can be informal . However , Thomson et al . [ 42 ] found that museum - based interventions allowed participants to interact with a range of people not typically encountered . Compared to informal inter - actions , interventions occurring within a museum increased the likelihood of short - term or long - term bonding between participants . While HCI has explored leveraging technology to make museums more accessible and interactive [ 6 , 23 , 43 ] , there is little research on how to support the social aspects of visiting a museum for PLWD . Ryding [ 36 ] designed a two - person interactive app for museums and found that this social dynamic allowed participants to create a more bespoke experience and explore the museum more playfully . In contrast , Clarke et al . ’s [ 8 ] research on interactive exhibition design explored distributed control , fnding enforced cooperation allowed participants to have more enriched social interactions by getting them to focus on others . Benford et al . ’s [ 2 ] work stim - ulated emotional responses and enabled art museum visitors to self - refect by attaching narratives and provocative questions to art - works . Interestingly , while the technological integration received mixed emotional responses , postcard printouts , which displayed representations of each participant’s emotional data , proved to be a powerful stimulus . However , beyond museums there is not enough research on the application of technology to improve the social accessibility of public spaces , not only for PLWD , but for older adults in general [ 34 ] . 2 . 3 HCI and Community - Based Design While research on improving the accessibility of public spaces for PLWD is still emerging , community - based research within HCI has helped designers develop strategies for working within and for a community . Although none of the participants had dementia , Har - rington et al . [ 19 ] held design workshops with Older African Amer - ican Adults at their residential living home . They found that the workshop’s situated context allowed participants to focus on signif - icant sociocultural issues that afected their community rather than individual solutions . Sabiescu et al . ’s [ 37 ] work with the Kalderash Roma community similarly found that community - based participa - tory design is not only infuenced by the participants’ culture but can also afect local relations and power structures . The Kalderash Roma community maintains a social hierarchy that goes against the inherent nature of participatory design , which promotes equity . When considering technology use within the community , Dil - lahunt et al . ’s [ 10 ] research on community - based mentoring found that mentors often had to be fexible with their technology use since not all participants had stable access to devices . Such a range of technology use is often true for older adults . Richards et al . [ 34 ] and Sin et al . [ 39 ] found that during the COVID - 19 pandemic , some older adults could adapt to using technology to remain connected to their community and loved ones while others struggled . Richards et al . [ 34 ] specifcally found that even those that adapted to using technology like Zoom refuse to use it now that they no longer have to isolate themselves from others . Sin et al . [ 39 ] concluded that the pandemic exasperated the digital divide providing a glimpse of the future we may be heading towards as more organizations , such as banks [ 27 ] , go fully digital . Therefore , research is further needed to Applying Technology in a Hybrid - Fashion to Create Dementia - Inclusive Community Spaces ASSETS ’22 , October 23 – 26 , 2022 , Athens , Greece understand the digital and sociocultural needs of older adults and PLWD within their community spaces . 3 METHODOLOGY The aim of this PhD project is to understand the complexities of social programs and the technology used to disseminate them , in order to understand the design requirements for organizing , devel - oping , and / or designing hybrid community spaces that are inclusive of PLWD and their informal carers . I defne hybrid as a community space that is both online and in - person , but I do not necessarily mean that activities or programs are happening synchronously . For instance , this could refer to an online community forum that is in some way connected to an in - person program . 3 . 1 Study 1 The purpose of my frst study was to answer the question : How might we design virtual spaces so that they provide for the social needs of those living with dementia ? By answering this question , I hoped to fnd out what allowed a social program to meet an individual’s social needs , how those social needs were met via virtual delivery , and where technology might need to be better adapted to increase social benefts . I identifed and characterized the interdependencies that assist with the delivery of social programs by interviewing program coordinators and holding two focus groups : one with PLWD and one with carers . Six participants who self - identifed as living with dementia and three of their carers were recruited through an Alzheimer’s Social Club . Since participation in the Social Club requires an early - to - mid - stage dementia diagnosis ; participants were not asked to share their specifc diagnoses . The participants were interviewed as a group since they were comfortable and felt safe discussing various topics with each other and encouraged each other to share . The group interview was also chosen so that it would mimic the feel of a Social Club gathering . Additionally , program coordinators from various social organizations were recruited to be interviewed . Coordinators were recruited from the US and UK due to having similar social services available for PLWD . Coordinators in the US were recruited via word of mouth , while those in the UK were found via groups listed on the Dementia Engagement and Empowerment Project UK [ 24 ] , and were recruited via email invite . Fifteen semi - structured interviews were conducted with seven program coordinators from the UK and eight from the US . While each coordinator’s job role varied slightly , most oversaw managing and designing accessibility programming . I applied a critical realist [ 5 , 32 ] approach to gain a thorough understanding of social programs . To achieve this , I initially exam - ined my data using constructivist grounded theory [ 7 ] in order to construct initial themes . The themes I identifed in all aspects of social programs were Reliance and Support . I felt that these themes aligned with Bennett et al . ’s [ 3 ] idea that all people form interde - pendencies by contributing and relying on community support and assistance . With Bennett et al . ’s [ 3 ] interdependency framework , I then reexamined my data to look for causal mechanisms behind the interdependencies I had noticed during my frst pass - through of the data . The fndings from Study 1 expanded upon Bennett et al . ’s [ 3 ] interdependency framework in that I found that beyond interdepen - dencies between individuals ( which I categorized as social ) there are also organizational interdependencies . Organizational interde - pendencies provide the context that determines the nature of a program and whether a program exists . While , person - centered strategies within dementia - specifc programs led to social inter - dependence between the participants and program coordinators . " Technology , " in a very broad sense of the word , was not only a point that can strengthen social interdependencies , as Bennett et al . [ 3 ] suggested , but potentially has the ability to cause these two types of interdependencies to overlap and infuence one another . Be - sides expanding the interdependency framework , the fndings from study one also provided a design checklist for designing programs and virtual spaces ( see tables 1 , 2 ) . Action to be Done Questions to Keep in Mind Accomplishing this Action Highlight loca - tion strengths Complementary Program is the program in - person / onsite ? - create greater so - cial engagement - make it a sensory experience - raise awareness about the organization by bringing people in or virtual / online ? - personalize - customize - and localize con - tent does the program incorporate con - tinuous use of in - person and virtual ? - participants should not be constrained by mobility , distance , or a lack of access to technology - program ofering and accessibility should be reliable is there an over - arching program narrative ? - celebrate repeti - tion by building it into the program’s narrative Table 1 : Checklist for designing blended programs . My fndings suggested that the concept of blended virtual / in - person programs needs to be reexamined in the context of social programs for PLWD . Virtual should not be thought of as simply a replacement or equivalent to in - person but as a complementary activity for building and sustaining interdependencies . The need for complementarity arises from the fact that both types of spaces have diferent strengths . Designing for complementary programs additionally allows for programs to meet participants’ other needs ( besides just social ) . For instance , providing program stability , fex - ibility , and even diminish stigma about the disease . Furthermore , since there has been little research on how to maximize the social benefts of virtual programs for PLWD , I also developed a short ASSETS ’22 , October 23 – 26 , 2022 , Athens , Greece Czech Action to be Done Accomplishing this Action Participant Share their Individual Sensory Experience Participants engage with the space / objects around them and their senses Objects and / or Technology Con - nect Diferent Locations Objects are transported between lo - cations creating a tangible memory or potentially asynchronous tech - nologies create a link Social Agendas that Appropriately Match the Locations Focus on empowering PLWD dur - ing virtual and support bonding and inclusion of informal carers when in - person Table 2 : Checklist for designing virtual spaces for PLWD . checklist to highlight how program coordinators and technologist can potentially adapt or redesign synchronous virtual programs to better suit the needs of PLWD . When organizations assume a one - to - one adaptation of an in - person program to any readily online platform will have similar positive efects this potentially limits social interactive for PLWD [ 22 ] . Such adaptations do not consider that readily available platforms are designed for a hyper - cognitive society [ 41 ] . Further information on my fndings from this study are in the technical paper that is to be published at ASSETS ’22 titled : “Just like meeting in person” - Examination of interdependencies in dementia - friendly virtual activities . 3 . 2 Study 2 The purpose of my second study is to answer the question : How might we design a hybrid community that includes people living with dementia and their informal carers ? By answering this ques - tion , I hope to fnd out how those living with dementia and their carers would like to engage with community spaces , what they envision makes a space inclusive of PLWD , and what role they envision technology could have in making a space inclusive . I will identify design requirements for making community spaces and programs more inclusive of PLWD through a research - through - design approach [ 46 ] . I plan to hold fve two - part workshops in various public spaces around Bristol , UK , where my university is located . These locations are set to include a history museum , art museum , community farm , church , and community centre . At the time of writing , these workshops are currently in progress there - fore , I do not have an exact number of participants . However , to recruit participants I sent fyers to various dementia and older adult associations around the city , attended dementia - specifc programs ( such as memory cafes ) to present briefy the study , and I have also relied on snowball recruitment . Only those with mild cognitive impairment or early stage dementia and their informal carers were recruited since the focus of this study was on those with some fa - miliarity with technology and possible experience attending virtual programs at some point . At each location we will hold a two - part workshop where each part will be completed on separate days with at least two weeks between each of the dates . For each location we plan to hold each workshop at the same time ( either both in the morning or afternoon ) . Part 1 : The purpose of the frst workshop is to discuss what makes a space comfortable , welcoming , and stress - free , and start to think about how technology can help or hinder with making a space accessible for PLWD and their informal carers . I will begin the workshop by stating the workshop objectives and workshop schedule . For the ice - breaker activity I will have participants locate on a map where they usually live . This activity is meant to spark conversation around physical accessibility , preparing for coming to the space , and motivations for visiting the space . Next I will engage participants in a discussion about what makes a space comfortable , welcoming , and stress - free ? Participants will be asked questions like “what time of day is the best ? ” and “what technology connects you to others ? ” Participants will be asked to initially give one word answers and once everyone answered we will have a discussion . The purpose of this activity is to encourage the participants to think about an ideal or not ideal space and / or technology . Finally , I will introduce participants to “I like , I wish , What if” and ask them to think of things that they like that the space does for PLWD , things that they wish that the space did better , and potential ideas of what could be done in the space for PLWD . To summarize the workshop , participants or I will draw combinations of the ideas they had come up with and envisioned how they would ft in the space . Part 2 : The second workshop aim is to explore how our senses ( smell , touch , taste , etc . ) can be used to make a space more inclusive while also considering how hybridity can come into play . Again , at the time of writing , this workshop has not yet been fully designed . I plan to take a feedback based design approach and ask participants at the conclusion of the frst workshop how they would like the second workshop to be conducted [ 17 ] . By doing this I hope to mitigate against participants potentially feeling that the design activities are " childish " [ 19 ] . However , I plan for the workshop to follow a similar format to the frst one , with each activity building of of the last . 3 . 3 Study 3 The purpose of my third study will be to answer the question : how might we implement hybrid design into a space so that it improves community inclusivity ? By answering this question , I aim to understand which design changes make crucial diferences in improving people’s sense of community belonging , how such changes afect the overall community , and what such changes mean for creating wellbeing and dementia awareness . I plan to choose one or two of the locations used in Study 2 to design either a program or space . The design work will be conducted through participatory design and , for continuity purposes , I plan to recruit from participants who joined Study 2 . 4 STATUS OF THE RESEARCH At the time of writing , I have completed Study 1 and have begun Study 2 . Study 3 has yet to be determined as it will build directly of of Study 2 . Potentially by the time of the Doctoral Constorium I will have more of a vision of how I plan to conduct Study 3 since I plan to conclude Study 2 in September 2022 . Study 2 is still in progress , and as of writing I have begun some of the frst parts of my workshop . Therefore , it is too early for me to share any tentative fndings . Thus , I still need to fnish Study 2 and design and execute Study 3 . I still have roughly one and a half years left in my program . At the Doctoral Consortium I hope to discuss the tentative fndings from my workshops . I would like to get advice also on how I might better frame my research so that its Applying Technology in a Hybrid - Fashion to Create Dementia - Inclusive Community Spaces ASSETS ’22 , October 23 – 26 , 2022 , Athens , Greece importance to the HCI community can be more clear . I also would like advice on how to make my fndings more accessible to the wider HCI community beyond accessibility . 5 ENVISIONED CONTRIBUTIONS Study 1 has already made three primary contributions to the AS - SETS community by : 1 ) identifying and highlighting the complexi - ties related to designing social programs for PLWD ; 2 ) grounding and expanding the interdependency framework in this context ; and 3 ) providing a design checklist to assist coordinators and the ASSETS community with developing technology for disseminat - ing social programs . This study added to the substantial research already conducted with PLWD within HCI by focusing on people with early stage dementia . This study also focused on social pro - grams designed for PLWD a subject that very few have studied . I hope that this research encourages others to explore such social programs and the growing ways technology is being used within them . For Study 2 , I aim to be able to contribute to the growing re - search on community - based design and methods for conducting similar workshops with early stage PLWD . I anticipate through the iterative design process of the workshop being able to provide designers with insights into what activities worked best . I plan to compare and contrast how diferent community spaces within one city envision dementia - inclusivity and outline ways designers can build in fexibility to form programs that match a space . I also intend with this study to contribute a set of design requirements for designing diferent types of technology to make community spaces more inclusive . Finally , I hope that this study generates examples of such technologies as designed with PLWD and their informal carers . For Study 3 , I aim to be able to provide an example of designing technology within a community context that is able to promote inclusivity . I plan to use participatory design methods [ 18 ] , and add to this research body by focusing on members of the dementia com - munity . Again , I anticipate that this work will add to the research already done on participatory design and dementia [ 20 ] . I also plan to further develop the interdependency framework [ 3 ] to determine whether technology design is able to increase outreach and impact as outlined in Study 1 . Thus , I believe this study will also help ex - pand the ASSETS community’s understanding of interdependency and the role of technology . Overall , I hope that my dissertation is able to contribute to ac - cessible technology by expanding research on dementia by looking at community - based social programs . Such research is meant to further expand how technology can bring together and maintain community care models . I hope that by making implementing the design from Study 3 so that it is accessible to not only PLWD but a wider community will raise awareness of the disease and decrease stigma . Additionally , I hope by expanding community outreach through technology this work will help communities understand and cope with the progressive nature of dementia . With this PhD project I hope that the design methodologies that I am able to produce will have value for designing programs or technologies for disseminating programs for not only PLWD but perhaps other neurodivergent populations as well .
