Does it transfer ? The effects of pre - internationalization experience on post - entry organizational learning in entrepreneurial Chinese firms Congcong Zheng & Susanna Khavul & Dilene Crockett Published online : 16 June 2012 # Springer Science + Business Media , LLC 2012 Abstract Although organizational learning plays a critical role in the international - ization of firms , researchers have largely focused on learning that occurs after a firm ’ s international entry ( “ learning by doing ” ) . Few studies have discussed how a firm ’ s experiences prior to international entry affect its organizational learning after entry . Using a sample of Chinese internationalizers , we argue that pre - entry characteristics will influence organizational learning after international entry . We argue and show that prior experience with international companies in the domestic market is trans - ferable and does affect an organization ’ s post - entry learning through a mechanism called analogical reasoning or “ learning by analogy . ” Keywords Organizational learning .

Facing liabilities of foreignness and newness at entry , new ventures are at a distinct disadvantage compared to incumbent competitors in the new market ( Zaheer 1995 ) . To reduce those liabilities , new ventures need to know how to quickly adapt to the new international market after their entry into it ( Rialp et al . 2005 ) . Such adaption enhanced by organizational learning , plays a key role in a new venture ’ s survival , and growth in overseas markets . Researchers have investigated how new ventures could facilitate learning through international expansion ( Zahra et al . 2000 ) , the building marketing and technological alliances ( Yu et al . 2011 ) , and various types of direct and vicarious experiences ( Schwens and Kabst 2009 ) . Although researchers have explored the learning of international entrepreneurial firms , gaps remain . Currently , only limited research has examined how a new venture ’ s pre - entry characteristics affect its organizational learning after entering an overseas market . A review of the literature by Zahra and George ( 2002a ) suggests that researchers have emphasized the effect of post - entry decisions and strategies , such as entry speed to different countries ( Prashantham and Young 2011 ) , country scope ( Roberts and Senturia 1996 ; Burgel and Murray 2000 ) , and the extent / degree of impact on internationalization ( Bloodgood et al . 1996 ; McDougall and Oviatt 1996 ; Zahra et al . 2000 ) on organizational learning . The discipline still knows little about whether and how pre - entry characteristics such as a firm ’ s age , strategic intent , and prior experience affect organizational learning after entry . Limited research in this area emphasizes the importance of prior direct managerial experience in foreign markets in acquiring knowledge and resources overseas . Reuber and Fischer ( 1997 ) have shown that the top management team plays a key role in foreign expansion and that firms with managers who have direct international experience are more likely to engage foreign strategic partners and more likely to obtain foreign sales soon after start - up ( Reuber and Fischer 1997 ; Reuber and Fischer 2002 ) . Despite the significance of direct internationalization experience prior to a firm ’ s entry into foreign markets , not all international entrepreneurial firms have the luxury of direct international market experience or have managers who have studied or worked overseas ( Contractor et al . 2007 ; Michailova and Wilson 2008 ) . For these kinds of internationalizing firms , especially those from emerging markets such as China , the lack of prior direct experience with international markets often exacerbates their liabilities of foreignness and amplifies the country - of - origin effects ( Yamakawa et al . 2008 ; Thomas et al . 2007 ) . Nevertheless , it is possible for firms that do not have the necessary prior accumulation of direct experience to improve their organizational learning as a result of internationalization ( Etemad and Wright 2005 ; Sapienza et al . 2006 ; McDougall et al . 1994 ) . Given the non - trivial drawback that lack of direct experience presents , the question remains — how can relatively inexperienced entre - preneurial firms achieve better organizational learning after entering foreign markets ? In this paper , we identify firm characteristics that enable entrepreneurial firms from emerging markets to compete internationally despite their lack of direct experience . Specifically , we propose that inexperience is not necessarily a disadvantage if the firm Does it transfer ? Effects of pre - internationalization experience 233 has certain related experience it can draw from and / or if the firm has a strong intention to internationalize and thus makes an organized effort to learn . The decisions that firms make in the early stages of their founding continue to influence how young firms allocate their attention , develop capabilities , and invest their resources ( Hannan et al . 1998 ; Sapienza et al . 2006 ) . We point out new ways that entrepreneurial firms can learn despite their limited experience in international markets . Our central argument is that entrepreneurial firms can enhance their learning from the internationalization process in three ways : first , by taking advantage of the flexibility often associated with young firm age ; second , by intentionally focusing the firm ’ s attention , resources , and capabilities towards international markets ; and third , by transferring lessons from prior related experience in the domestic market to experiences in international markets . In order to focus on the strategic implications of age , intent , and transferable experience , we collected data on 132 Chinese entrepreneurial firms in the high technology , manufacturing , and business service industries . China was an attractive venue because internationalization was common there . For example , in 2003 , exports in China stood at 30 % of GDP versus 9 % in the USA ( World Bank Indicator 2011 ) . Further , many exporters in China are small , entrepreneurial firms that lack direct managerial experience in international markets , yet they are able to expand and thrive there . For example , the founder of Lenovo , Liu Chuanzhi , spent his early career as a Chinese scientist and as a laborer on a state - owned rice farm . He had no prior international experience before founding the Legend Group ( predecessor to Lenovo ) with just US $ 25 , 000 and ten colleagues . Yet , his company grew to eventually purchase IBM ’ s personal computing division ( Lenovo 2009 ) . Our study offers some insight into these kinds of successes . Our empirical results support the organizational learning view of the firm . Our study extends previous research in that we identify key pre - entry characteristics that affect organizational learning after a firm has internationalized . Our results support the imprinting argument to show that decisions made in the early stages of a firm ’ s existence have a long - lasting impact on subsequent organizational learning . As such , we find that a clear strategic intent at founding and transferable experience prior to international entry can improve the organizational learning that entrepreneurial firms experience after they enter foreign markets ( Chaston et al . 2001 ) . We proceed to explain our three theoretical arguments in light of the current internationalization literature . We develop hypotheses that test the effects of firm age , strategic intent , and prior domestic experience on post - entry organizational learning . We test our hypotheses on a sample of emerging Chinese firms competing in the service , manufacturing , and technology sectors . Our results support the idea that young firms and firms with strong internationalization intentions will have improved organizational learning after entry into foreign markets . The results also show that firms with previous related experience can inventively apply analogical reasoning to transfer that experience to international markets . Finally , we discuss implications of our findings for international entrepreneurship theory . Theory and hypotheses International entrepreneurship researchers have long built upon the knowledge , learning , and capabilities theories from organizational science to tackle international 234 C . Zheng et al . entrepreneurship ( IE ) questions ( Zahra et al . 2000 ; Sapienza et al . 2006 ) . Previous research has emphasized the importance of viewing the internationalization process as evolutionary , where the key to successful operation is learning , creating , and transferring knowledge ( Kogut and Zander 1993 ) . Consistent with this view , IE researchers have investigated various aspects of the internationalization learning process , including whether it is better to begin the internationalization process soon after the firm ’ s founding or wait for the firm to have success in domestic markets first ( Autio et al . 2000 ; Wood et al . 2011 ) ; whether the firm would achieve more learning , growth , and better performance by pursuing an aggressive or conservative expansion pattern ( Zahra et al . 2000 ) ; and whether a firm ’ s partnering strategies affect learning within international joint ventures ( Lu and Beamish 2006 ) . Recent literature reviews show that research has had a primary focus on how post - entry decisions and strategies affect learning from internationalization ( Zahra and George 2002b ; Rialp et al . 2005 ; Khavul et al . 2010a , b ) . Even though this has greatly enriched our understanding of the learning process and experience of international entrepreneurial ventures , researchers have been largely silent on how pre - entry characteristics affect post - entry organizational learning ( Zahra 2005 ) . Zahra and George ( 2002a ) proffered a general theoretical model for the field of entrepre - neurship and emphasized the effect of antecedents to international entrepreneur - ship . They called for investigation into these pre - entry characteristics , arguing that factors such as top management team characteristics , firm resources ( finan - cial , experiential , etc . ) , and firm - related variables ( such as age and size ) at the formative stage of a new venture have important implications for entry and post - entry learning . Research discussing the antecedents of learning has largely emphasized top management experience . Reuber and Fischer ( 1997 ) highlighted the importance of managerial expertise during the internationalization process and found that internationally experienced managers are more likely to develop foreign strategic partnerships and obtain foreign sales after start - up , thereby achieving a higher level of internationalization faster ( Reuber and Fischer 1997 ) . However , gaps still remain at the firm level of analysis . For instance , one important question is : “ how do firms from emerging markets learn without direct managerial experience ? ” Our paper focuses on pre - entry characteristics such as age , strategic intent , and transfer - able experience and discusses how these mechanisms can influence learning from internationalization among international entrepreneurial firms . We develop our hy - potheses below . Firm age and organizational learning Reviewing a total of 38 empirical studies in the IE area , Rialp et al . ( 2005 ) contend that organizational learning theory is one of the many theories researchers use to investigate international entrepreneurship . Researchers have found that firms that start their internationalization soon after their founding ( Autio et al . 2000 ) , that enter diverse markets ( Zahra et al . 2000 ) , and that can glean / absorb through tacit knowl - edge from their joint venture partners ( Lu and Beamish 2006 ) to learn then through their internationalization efforts . According to Autio et al . ( 2000 ) and Sapienza et al . ( 2006 ) , one of the factors that differentiate international entrepreneurial firms relates Does it transfer ? Effects of pre - internationalization experience 235 to when firms enter international markets . According to the theory of the “ learning advantage of newness , ” firms that internationalize earlier in their life cycle are more likely to learn faster and better during their internationalization process . This advantage accrues to them because they are less likely to develop competency traps ( Levitt and March 1988 ) or adopt dominant logics ( Bettis and Prahalad 1995 ) and because they are less likely to have developed a stable network of suppliers and consumers in the domestic market that require sustained commitment from them . These characteristics make them more likely to adopt a positive , open attitude towards internationalization and allow them to make stronger ( relative ) commitments to developing international markets ( Sapienza et al . 2006 ) . In addition , Zahra et al . ( 2000 ) suggest that new ventures that internationalize early can benefit from the diverse international markets that they enter . As such , entrepreneurial firms often utilize international entry as a catalyst for growth ( Oviatt and McDougall 1994 ; Zahra et al . 2000 ) and benefit from this effort by developing an ability to adapt to uncertainty and by creating an internal receptivity to change ( Sapienza et al . 2006 ) . Internationalization is a source for learning as it supplies knowledge about foreign culture , business practices , institutional character - istics , and other site - specific knowledge . Such “ fresh ” knowledge could potentially improve the internal capabilities of firms as it exposes firms to alternative , potentially more efficient routines , to different perspectives , to new practices , to new technolo - gies , and to new strategies . However , that fresh knowledge also requires active acquisition , absorption , assimilation , transformation , and exploitation to be useful ( Autio et al . 2010 ; Zahra and George 2002b ) . As a result , firms often have to adapt their existing routines to accommodate external knowledge gained internationally . Here age plays a role in facilitating or impeding learning ( Zheng and Khavul , 2005 ) . One view , much discussed in the literature , is the process view of internationalization , which suggests that learning is more effective when it is sequential and so based on previously acquired knowledge . While scholars have often positioned this view in direct opposition to the early internationalization theory ( Oviatt and McDougall 1994 ) , Johanson and Vahlne ( 1977 ) themselves suggest that this may be a misrepre - sentation of their theory . In their 2009 article , which updated the process view from its 1977 origins , Johanson and Vahlne ( 2009 , p . 1415 ) explain that they did indeed base their 1977 model on the assumption that “ knowledge that grows out of experi - ence in current activities ( operations ) is crucial to the learning process . ” Their original model focuses on the type of learning ( direct experience ) and their updated model suggests that direct experience and relationship building take time . Other researchers may have drawn ( some would say obvious ) conclusion that older firms have had more time to develop this kind of knowledge than younger firms . However , in the original model , Johanson and Vahlne claim that they proposed a sequential learning process because they were attempting to explain corporate entrepreneurship , not new ventures ( 2009 , p . 1422 ) . In addition , their model did not have anything to say about the “ beginnings of internationalization ” ( 2009 , p . 1416 ) or the speed of international expansion ( 2009 , p . 1421 ) . They agree that “ knowledge and relationships ( pertaining to international markets ) might indeed be in place prior to the formal founding of the focal firm ” ( 2009 , p . 1421 ) and that these pre - existing conditions are not incompat - ible with their model . 236 C . Zheng et al . In this research , we agree with Johanson and Vahlne ’ s assertion that relationship building and direct experience take time to develop and are key to the success of post - entry organizational learning . We extend this idea by proposing that other kinds of learning may also affect the success of post - entry learning . Toward this end , we propose investigating which pre - existing factors can have an impact on the effective - ness of that direct post - entry learning . In doing so , we acknowledge that a firm ’ s age can impede post - entry learning because as firms age they become more and more stable , and their internal processes tend to perpetuate their existing routines and structures ( Hannan 1998 ; Hannan and Freeman 1984 ) . Sometimes this aging effect ( which invests in the more stable existing routines and structures ) can result in older firms becoming rigid and less likely to change and adapt to new external knowledge , especially unfamiliar knowledge from international markets ( Baum 1996 ) . In contrast , young firms , because of their flexible organizational struc - tures and relatively open attitude to change , are more receptive to acquiring , absorbing , assimilating , and utilizing new knowledge gained from international exposure ( Stinchcombe 1965 ) . In summary then , we base our first set of arguments on age , routine forma - tion , and renewal . A younger firm , we theorize , is better able to alter its routines to adapt to the different demands of international markets simply because youn - ger firms are less established and so are better able to change and modify their routines as a result of their internationalization experiences ( Sapienza et al . 2006 ) . Internationalization exposes a firm to uncertainty and risks , contexts that force it to adapt to a new environment ( Zheng and Khavul , 2006 ) . To thrive in the new environment , firms have to be able to develop new routines , reconfigure their resource bases to support the new routines , and perhaps make structural changes that match the organization to the new environment . Older firms are more likely than younger firms to resist those changes because as they age their capabilities can become increasingly unfit , executives become vested in the existing structure , and the knowledge and capabilities become calcified ( Autio et al . 2000 ) . In contrast , younger firms can learn and benefit more from knowledge gained from international markets . Thus , we hypothesize as follows : Hypothesis 1 : For entrepreneurial firms , firm age is negatively associated with organizational learning as a result of international entry . Intent to internationalize and organizational learning In our second set of arguments , we propose that firms that at founding have clear intent to expand internationally approach their post - international - entry process with more focus for their learning . We base this set of arguments on strategic intent and its ability to direct the organization ’ s attention toward learning from the internationali - zation process ( Khavul et al . 2010b ) At the organizational level , a firm that has the goal of internationalization at founding will tend to be deliberate about sharing information and selecting , accumulating , and utilizing lessons from entering interna - tional markets ( Zollo and Winter 2002 ) . Strategic management scholars have long recognized intent as key to actively focus an organization on important goals ( Hamel and Prahalad 1989 ) . The Does it transfer ? Effects of pre - internationalization experience 237 international business literature reflects the belief that strategic intent is one of the primary motivations for companies to enter foreign markets ( Rui and Yip 2008 ) . For an organization to be intentional with its internationalization efforts , the firm must communicate the intent to its actors and through its actors as well as dedicate resources to the effort ( Alon and McKee 1999 ) . Recent research in organizational learning ( Freeman et al . 2010 ; Kuivalainen et al . 2010 ; Zollo and Winter 2002 ; ) shows that the way firms handle knowledge is even more crucial for learning than simple experiential accumulation of knowledge . Zollo and Singh ( 2004 ) argue that “ the extent to which the individuals and the groups that possess knowledge are actually aware of it , can describe it , and therefore communi - cate it using oral or written media ” will influence how operational practices develop and evolve within a firm . We argue that firms that quickly assimilate learning from internationalization into their operations have viewed internationalization as a strate - gic goal and pursued it with strategic intent for a long time . Therefore , they are more conscientious in articulating and transferring the knowledge that they gain interna - tionally to other functional areas of the firm . Firms with strong international intent will also allocate more managerial attention and more resources to international markets , making the internationalization effort more integrated within the overall firm operations . We propose that intention focuses a firm ’ s effort and concentrates shared attention , thus facilitating organizational learning from internationalization . By placing mana - gerial emphasis on internationalization through specific goals and objectives and through resource deployment , firms put it in a position of prominence in the organi - zation ( Alon and McKee 1999 ) . When an issue is salient to the members of an organization , information surrounding it is ingested and assimilated into that organ - ization ’ s routines and activities differently than learning about less prominent content . Neurobiologists would describe this phenomenon in the following terms : human cognition alters depending on the salience of the stimulus challenging it to learn ( Lyles 1988 ; Ruigrok and Wagner 2003 ; Rumbaugh et al . 2007 ) . Salience works by determining what gets noticed in a learning situation as well as resulting in an attribution process that determines who gets credited with the outcomes ( Haunschild and Miner 1997 ) . Thus , we propose the following hypothesis : Hypothesis 2 : For entrepreneurial firms , prior intent to internationalize is posi - tively associated with organizational learning as a result of international entry . Transferable experience and organizational learning We base our third set of arguments on the idea that firms can utilize prior experience from the domestic market to enhance post - entry learning from internationalization , transferring the experience using an analogical reasoning mechanism . Analogical reasoning purports that individuals learn by searching , identifying , and utilizing analog experiences from related activities ( Holland et al . 1986 ) . That is , they transfer mental models and rules across different situations . Gavetti et al . ( 2005 ) gave an example of analogical reasoning based on the concept of the supermarket . The supermarket is a retail format pioneered during the 1930s and has served as an analogical source for several industries . For example , the supermarket format inspired 238 C . Zheng et al . Charles Lazarus to start Toys R Us in the 1950s . Having identified the similarities between the supermarket industry and the toy industry , Charles Lazarus transferred the concept of the supermarket retail format to innovate retail distribution in the toy industry . In the international setting , we argue that individuals and firms could use existing knowledge resources from their experience in the domestic market to model and improve learning from their foreign entry experiences . While firms can carry several types of learning to new situations , we are proposing that transferable experience is the most appropriate in an international setting . In lieu of direct experience , entrepreneurial firms can learn from indirect experience either by watching others ’ behaviors , e . g . , vicarious experience ( Holcomb et al . 2009 ) , or by adopting lessons from related activities , e . g . , transferable experience ( Schilling et al . 2003 ) . Transferable experience ( Finkelstein and Haleblian 2002 ) , also called experi - ence spillover effect , is defined as “ the impact of the experience accumulated in the execution of activity j on the performance of activity i ” ( according to a 2005 INSEAD working paper by Zollo and Reuer ) . The transfer of experience between different types of activities within the same focal actor lies at the center of the learning process . An example of transferable experience is that when an individual trained to drive a car can apply his / her skills to drive a truck ( Finkelstein and Haleblian 2002 ) . Recent developments in cognitive psychology posit that learning is an iterative process that consists of interpretation , inference , and hypothesis testing . Transferable learning can only happen if human beings are capable of applying inferential rules to the relation - ships between events and are capable of forming a family of hypotheses from the inferential exercise , which subsequent events can test ( Holland et al . 1986 ) . The inferential rule that accompanies transferable experience is analogical reasoning , which Gick and Holyoak ( 1983 ) define as “ the transfer of knowledge from one situation to another by a process of mapping — finding a set of one - to - one correspon - dence ( often incomplete ) between aspects of one body of information and aspects of another ” ( Gick and Holyoak 1983 ) . The two situations are called analogs ( the source analog and the target analog ) , which can either be objects or situations . For example , an object - based analogy would compare a heart to a water pump and a situation - based analogy would liken learning to speak a foreign language to learning to ride a bike . The successful use of analogical reasoning depends on the recognition and exploita - tion of some significant similarities between the target analog and the source analog . Various factors influence the successful execution of analogical reasoning . They include the type of knowledge transferred ( e . g . , motor or cognitive skills , declarative or procedural memory , etc . ) , the existence and strength of rules identifying the tasks ( Holland et al . 1986 ) , cues that prime the emergence of schema that guide the transfer ( Gick and Holyoak 1983 ; Cheng et al . 1986 ) , the characteristics of the transfer process such as surface semantic and syntactic similarity ( Reed et al . 1974 ) , the learner ’ s background knowledge ( Larkin et al . 1980 ) , and the explicit pinpointing of core principles by experimenters or “ teachers ” ( according to a 2005 Harvard working paper by Morah et al . ) . Increasingly , organizational researchers have also started to uncover evidence of analogical reasoning and transferable experience in business settings ( Gavetti et al . 2005 ) . Similar to individual learning , organizational learning is unlikely to happen unless experience and history are coded , interpreted , stored , and used to guide future behavior ( Zollo and Winter 2002 ; Zollo and Singh 2004 ) . Organizational level transfer does not happen unless decision makers recognize the Does it transfer ? Effects of pre - internationalization experience 239 analogy between source and target problems , understand the source analog , map the similarities between source and target , and translate the source solution to use in the target problem ( Gavetti et al . 2005 ) . In the international business environment , foreign companies seeking to enter China with their products have long tapped as partners Chinese companies operating in the domestic market . Through their partnerships in the domestic market , these Chinese firms are obtaining skills which they can retrieve and use when they launch into foreign markets themselves . The Chinese entrepreneurial firms can apply skills such as reading cultural cues , building trust , identifying business models , and negotiating international contracts when they enter foreign markets ( Blomstermo et al . 2004 ; Dana et al . 2001 ; Ring and Van de Ven 1994 ) . For example , a Chinese firm that assists a Japanese company to open the Chinese local market is likely to become aware of novel entry strategies , business models , and new ways of distribution and branding . Later on , if the Chinese company interna - tionalizes to the USA , the company could use similar entry strategies , distribution channels , and branding strategies in the USA . A good example of this situation is the Chinese company ZhongKe Electronics and Optical , which was set up at the end of 2000 in Beijing to target the optical electronics market . ZhongKe worked with Japanese partners to reduce costs through full automation . As a result , ZhongKe built a fully automated plant in Shenzhen before expanding to the US market . In this way , firms originating in emerging markets , such as China , have a unique internationali - zation advantage based on the benefits they have received “ at home by cooperating … with global players , allowing emerging market enterprises to undertake their own foreign market entry [ i . e . , exporting or establishing subsidiaries in foreign countries ] later in some unconventional ways ” ( Luo and Tung 2007 , p . 481 ) . As suggested earlier , Lenovo , the Chinese computer manufacturer , is another example of a firm that has learned from its domestic experience to enhance its post - entry operation . After its founding , Lenovo became the major distributor in China for foreign PC producers , such as Hewlett Packard and Toshiba , in the late 1980s and 1990s before it started selling its PC in the ASEAN market . Lenovo eventually acquired the IBM PC division in 2005 ( Lenovo 2009 ) . Learning about external culture and processes through their domestic agreements with Hewlett Packard and Toshiba might have prepared Lenovo to more readily adapt and learn from their experiences in IBM ’ s wider markets . In fact , Lenovo founder Liu Chuanzhi , in a 2001 interview with The Economist , said : “ Our earliest and best teacher was Hewlett - Packard ” ( The Economist 2001 ) . In line with this reasoning , our research suggests that entrepreneurial firms who have collaboration experience with foreign partners in their domestic market prior to attempting their own entry into foreign markets will be able to transfer that prior experience to the internationaliza - tion process . This theory is an extension of a prior research where Lu and Beamish ( 2006 ) studied the positive effects that joint venture partnering had on learning among small and medium enterprises during internationalization . Thus , we hypoth - esize as follows : Hypothesis 3 : For entrepreneurial firms , experience with foreign partners in the domestic market prior to internationalization is positively associated with orga - nizational learning as a result of international entry . 240 C . Zheng et al . Method Empirical setting and data collection We test our hypotheses using a sample of Chinese technology , business services , and manufacturing entrepreneurial firms . According to the World Investment Report ( UNCTAD 2006 ) , China leads the world ’ s emerging markets in FDI outflows of $ 33 billion . China is also one of the world ’ s leaders of exporting , with exporting sales totaling US $ 1 . 19 trillion in 2009 . Considering China ’ s central position in the growth of world trade and the fact that numerous Chinese firms started to internationalize after its WTO entry in 2001 , we anticipated that China would be an excellent context in which to test our hypotheses . We collected data in two major Chinese cities ( Beijing and Shanghai ) in 2003 through face - to - face structured interviews . A native Chinese speaker conducted all of the interviews . We developed the survey instrument using pre - tests , translations , and back - translations . The English survey instrument was first pre - tested by a group of five English - speaking entrepreneurs . We reworked the questionnaire based on their feedback and then had it translated to Chinese . Finally , the Chinese version was translated back into English to assure that the translated questionnaire was comparable to the original English one . The Chinese interviewer used the Chinese questionnaire to guide the interviews and record the respondent ’ s answers . For the sample , we targeted firms that had initiated international sales by the time of data collection . We compiled the sampling frame of international entrepreneurial firms based on company lists that were most likely to include international entrepre - neurial firms in technology , service , and manufacturing industries . The lists include the following : Beijing Foreign Economic Trade Commission , China Commodity Net database by the Ministry of Commerce — People ’ s Republic of China , Zhongguancun Science Park Administration Committee , China Custom Office ( Beijing ) , Shanghai Custom Office , and Shanghai Foreign Economic Relationship and Trade Office . Similar data sources have been used in previous studies on Chinese technology firms ( Zhang and Li 2009 ; Zhang et al . 2009 ) . Our study minimized the potential bias introduced by the central government in China because all of the firms in our sample are independent and small . Our sampling frame totalled 610 firms with an average firm age of 5 . 401 years . We contacted all 610 firms and were only able to carry out the face - to - face structured interviews with 146 of the firms . The face - to - face survey method , though costly , allowed us to ensure that the respondents were qualified , suitable personnel and also offered us an opportunity to clarify the survey questions with the respondents . In emerging economies where the respondents are not as familiar with academic surveys and could be reluctant to reveal sensitive company information , face - to - face interviews enable researchers to build trust with the respondents , making it the most effective way to collect data ( Li and Atuahene - Gima 2001 ) . Because of missing data ( e . g . , survey respondents refused to answer certain questions ) , the final analysis used a dataset of 132 firms . The response rate for this sample is 21 . 4 % , which is well within acceptable standards for international survey data ( Filatochev et al . 2001 ) . Due to the limited secondary firm - level information available in transitional economies like China ( Filatochev et al . 2001 ) , it is difficult to assess the potential Does it transfer ? Effects of pre - internationalization experience 241 for non - response bias in the sample . Rather than comparing key characteristics ( such as size or age ) of the respondents and non - respondents ( McDougall 1989 ) , we compared our sample with data collected in a separate study by Li and Atuahene - Gima ( 2001 ) in Beijing , China , at a similar time of our study . In our sample , 58 firms come from high technology industries ( including 14 in information and communica - tion technology hardware , 12 in software , and 32 in biotechnology , pharmaceutical , and advanced chemical industry ; 52 from the machinery and equipment manufactur - ing industry ; and 22 from business and management service firms ) . We compared our high technology subsample ( 58 firms ) with Li and Atuahene - Gima ’ s ( 2001 ) high technology sample . In their study , the average age of new ventures is 4 . 83 years and ours is 4 . 77 . In their sample , the average size of the high technology firms is 160 . 98 and the firm size in our high technology subsample is 184 . 40 . A comparison of the R & D spending in their sample ( mean R & D expense as a percentage of sales ) was 20 % and in our sample was 21 . 20 % . In light of the restrictions of studying entrepreneurial firms from emerging markets , similar profiles provide external valid - ity about sample representativeness . Respondents We contacted the CEO of each of the firms on the lists and solicited their participation in the personal interviews . For those CEOs who declined to the interview , we asked for a referral to the next most prominent manager who would be knowledgeable about the company ’ s key strategic and international decisions . The average respondent is a 45 - year - old male ( 78 . 6 % ) with a bachelor ’ s degree ( 74 . 2 % ) in either engineering and science ( 54 . 5 % ) or law ( 30 . 7 % ) . Ninety - two percent of these respondents serve on the top management team of their organizations , either in a corporate management role such as CEO or CFO or in the key positions of marketing or production management . Thirty percent of the respondents were on the firm ’ s board of directors and 30 % had started another firm before the current one . Because of their prominent positions within the entrepreneurial firms , these respondents served as “ key inform - ants ” for their organizations . We expected these founders and managers , as individ - uals responsible for strategic decisions for their firms , to be informed about and influential in their firm ’ s internationalization strategies , intentions , and interactions with the alliance partners ( Hambrick 1981 ; Huber and Power 1985 ) . We acknowledge the limitations associated with retrospective data collection — respondents may not be able to recall information correctly because of inappropriate rationalization , oversimplification , faulty attribution , and simple lapse of memory ( Golden 1992 ) . However , Miller et al . ( 1997 ) , in a validation study on retrospective reports , argue that retrospective errors are most likely when the questionnaire meas - ures are complex and lack reliability . Following their recommendation , we used reliable , valid , and established measures for our key variables which we explain in detail below . Our sample research design included cross - sectional data collected from a single respondent , which could make it subject to potential common method variance bias . To rule out this problem , we assessed the potential bias using the Harman one - factor test recommended by Podsakoff and Organ ( 1986 ) . Following their recommendation , all the variables of interest were entered into a principal axis factor analysis with a 242 C . Zheng et al . promax rotation method to see whether a single method factor would account for the majority of the covariance in the independent and dependent variables . The factor analysis resulted in a five - factor solution with the five factors explaining approximately 71 . 58 % of the variance and the first factor explain - ing only 20 . 22 % of the variance . If substantial common method variance is present , either a single factor would emerge or one general factor would account for most of the covariance in the independent and criterion variables ( Podsakoff and Organ 1986 ) . This was not present in our data , thus increasing confidence in the results . Sample descriptives The unit of analysis in our study is the entrepreneurial firm . The average entrepre - neurial firm in our sample was incorporated in the year 1996 , made its first domestic sale in 1997 , and recorded its first international sale in 1998 . Fifty percent of the sampled firms provide end products , 36 . 2 % provide intermediate products , and 10 . 7 % provide services . The average size of the founding team in the sampled firms is just under five , and in 80 . 3 % of the companies the CEO was one of the founders . The average firm had about 124 employees after the first year of operation and at the time of data collection had 253 employees . Dependent variable In terms of construct validity , we took care to use existing measures to operationalize the key variables as discussed below . Organizational learning is the dependent variable in this study . We follow the conceptualization by Sapienza et al . ( 2006 ) of internationalization as a process that encourages entrepreneurial firms to learn and improve the sophistication of their overall capabilities . Therefore , the outcome of the learning process captures our measure of organizational learning . In order to operationalize organizational learning , we asked the top management team mem - ber to report whether internationalization had improved the firm in terms of ( 1 ) technological sophistication , ( 2 ) marketing sophistication , ( 3 ) manufacturing / pro - duction sophistication , and ( 4 ) organizational sophistication . We asked the respondents to answer four questions on a scale of 1 – 5 with 1 being strongly disagree and 5 being strongly agree . Cronbach ’ s alpha for the organizational learning measure is 0 . 831 , suggesting good reliability and internal consistency ( Chandler and Hanks 1993 ) . According to a principal axis factor analysis ( with promax rotation ) , all four items load into one single factor , which explains 70 . 03 % of the variance . Our dependent variable is the average of the scores on the four items . Independent variables Firm age is measured by the number of years since a firm ’ s founding . It is useful to point out that our argument here regards the effect that age has on organizational learning outcomes and our focal variable differs from age at international entry , the variable used by Sapienza et al . ( 2006 ) and Autio et al . ( 2000 ) . While we focus on a Does it transfer ? Effects of pre - internationalization experience 243 variable that correlates with organizational learning outcomes at one point in time , their variable is more process - oriented since they argue that the initiation of internationalization changes the dynamics of international vs . domestic learning effort . Intent to internationalize has two dimensions in this study : ( 1 ) intent defined by the fact that internationalization was a primary goal of the organization early in the establishment of the firm and ( 2 ) intent defined by the fact that the firm has allocated resources toward internationalization early in the establishment of the firm . The two intent variables capture the extent to which firms have set internationalization as a strategic goal and have made resource commitments towards it — key dimensions of strategic intent as suggested by Hamel and Prahalad ( 1989 ) and Rui and Yip ( 2008 ) . According to Hamel and Prahalad ( 1989 ) , firms with strategic intent pursue certain long - term strategic objectives , even when those strategic objectives were considered as highly unrealistic in view of a firm ’ s current resources and capabilities . Strategic intent also focuses the entire organization ( the resources and the attention ) on achieving such goals ( Hamel and Prahalad 1989 ) . To measure the goal intent , we asked whether the top management team had emphasized internationalization as a primary goal in the first 3 years after founding ( Khavul et al . 2010b ; Wood et al . 2011 ) . We worded our question as follows : During the first 3 years , was selling in international markets your company ’ s primary focus ? Here ( 1 ) is yes and ( 0 ) is no . To measure the resource allocation intent , we asked whether the firm had invested in new plants or modified any existing plants for the purpose of internationalizing . We worded our question as follows : Have you invested in new plants or modifications to existing plants for the purpose of internationalization ? Please select yes or no . Since the two intent variables tap into different aspects of a firm ’ s intent ( strategic goal vs . actual resource allocation ) , we separate them in our analysis and enter them into the regression analysis as two distinct variables . Transferable experience is characterized in our study as prior alliance experience with foreign partners in the domestic market . We adopted this measure from strategy literature where researchers have used transferable experience to explain acquisition performance ( Finkelstein and Haleblian 2002 ; Haleblian and Finkelstein 1999 ) . These researchers argue that firms could transfer the models and experiences from prior organizational acquisitions to new acquisitions , thus improving acquisition performance . Using a database of 449 acquisitions , Haleblian and Finkelstein ( 1999 ) showed a U - shaped relationship between prior acquisition experiences with new acquisition performance . Following their study , we also argue that entrepreneur - ial firms could transfer their prior alliance experience to international settings , thus improving organizational learning . We measured this variable by the number of alliance relationships that the Chinese firms had with foreign partners in China prior to their own entry into foreign markets ( Anand and Khanna 2000 ; Hoang and Rothamel 2005 ) . The measure does not include the number of alliances that the firms established during and after international entry . Control variables We control for firm size , industry , total breadth of alliance network , and international sales levels . 244 C . Zheng et al . Firm size This might influence the transfer of experience and organizational learning in general because larger firms are more likely than smaller firms to have more specialized managerial roles in each . In larger firms , there might be a department that specializes in promoting exports and developing outreach alliance relationships while another department might establish sales channels in the domestic market for incom - ing foreign alliance partners . The larger a firm the more difficult it might be for employees and managers in those different departments to share knowledge content and to communicate regularly with each other . As a result , larger firms might find it difficult to transfer learning experiences from one type of activity ( e . g . , inward alliance management ) to another ( outward international development ) . We measure firm size using the number of employees . The skewness of the firm size variable is 2 . 96 , outside of the normally acceptable range of − 2 . 0 to + 2 . 0 . Therefore , we use the logarithm of the number of employees as an indicator of firm size . Industry dummies In order to separate different industry sectors and account for the different dynamics within those industry sectors , we entered industry dummies into the regression equation . We separated industries into three categories : ( 1 ) high technology sector ( including ICT hardware , software products , biotechnology , phar - maceutical and advanced chemicals ) , ( 2 ) manufacturing sector ( including machinery and equipment manufacturing ) , and ( 3 ) business service industries ( IT , technical service and management service sectors ) . The baseline category is business service industries . Firm ’ s general alliance network To tease out potentially confounding effects from the size of a firm ’ s network of alliances , we control for the total number of alliances that the firm has in the ( 1 ) domestic and ( 2 ) international markets . Recent research has shown that business networks provide effective opportunities for vicarious learning ( Lyles 1988 ; Beamish 1994 ; Powell et al . 1996 ; Zhan and Luo 2008 ) . The broader a firm ’ s strategic alliance network the broader the information , knowledge , and re - source base that the firm can access , and potentially , the better it can improve its learning and performance . International sales intensity Autio et al . ( 2000 ) found that international sales inten - sity is positively and significantly related to organizational learning . We argue that firms which derive more of their sales from international markets might be more motivated to learn about international markets and thus improve overall organiza - tional learning . Therefore , we need to control for these effects . We use the percentage of overall sales that the firm has from international sources as the control variable ( Filatochev et al . 2001 ) . Results Table 1 shows the mean values , standard deviations , and correlations for all measured variables . A close look at Table 1 shows that multicollinearity among the independent variables is not a major issue for our data . No correlation coefficient in Table 1 is more than 0 . 60 ( Wooldrige 2003 ) . Tests of multicollinearity in the regression analysis Does it transfer ?

Zheng et al . confirm this as the VIF values range between 1 . 9 and 2 . 7 , all of which are in the acceptable range . We used ordinary least squares ( OLS ) regression to test our hypotheses . The results shown in Table 2 reflect the regressions of the hypothesized variables on organizational learning . The adjusted R 2 values for the tested models range from 0 . 119 to 0 . 213 . These adjusted R 2 statistics show that the model explains around 20 % of the variance in the dependent variable , which is comparable to other published studies that examine international learning , including Zahra et al . ( 2000 ) with 0 . 27 to 0 . 37 and Sapienza et al . ( 2005 ) with 0 . 12 – 0 . 25 . Hypothesis 1 , which addresses the age effect , receives modest support ( p < . 10 ) . The results show that the younger the firm is the more likely that it will improve its organizational learning as a result of internationalization . Hypothesis 2 , which addresses intent to internationalize , and Hypothesis 3 , which addresses transferable experience , each receive strong support from the model ( at p < . 01 and p < . 05 levels , respectively ) .

Effects of pre - internationalization experience 247 are those with strong prior intent and those that use prior transferable experience to improve learning from internationalization . Firms that set internationalization as a primary goal at the start of their founding and prepare for internationalization by investing in resources to accommodate internationalization are likely to improve their organizational learning from entry into international markets . Finally , firms that have prior experiences in the domestic market will be able to transfer that experience to improve learning from entry into foreign markets . Discussion and conclusion This study is among the few that explore the relationship between pre - entry firm characteristics and post - entry effects on organizational learning from internationali - zation . While a number of studies have theoretically and empirically considered the learning process after and during the internationalization process ( Sapienza et al . 2005 , 2006 ) , pre - entry characteristics remain understudied in the literature . In fact , two important recent reviews of internationalization research have acknowledged this gap in the literature ( Rialp et al . 2005 ; Zahra and George 2002a ) . To begin to fill this gap then , we explore three characteristics that scholars have considered important antecedents to learning in other circumstances — firm age ( the learning advantage of newness ( Autio et al . 2000 ; Sapienza et al . 2006 ) ) , strategic intent ( strategic manage - ment ( Hamel and Prahalad 1989 ) ) , and transferable experience ( acquisition perfor - mance ( Finkelstein and Haleblian 2002 ) ) . We theoretically argue and empirically show that ( 1 ) young firms can learn ( mildly ) better than older firms from their internationalization effort , ( 2 ) regardless of age , firms that intend to pursue interna - tionalization from the beginning are better able to learn from the actual process of internationalization ( Zollo and Winter 2002 ) , and ( 3 ) the transfer of prior experience across activities and time contributes to learning in international settings . Age and intent On the one hand , our research found only mild support for the idea that younger firms are better than older firms at utilizing their learning from internationalization to increase the sophistication and capabilities of the firm . The tentativeness of our results does suggest that , in order to achieve benefits of capability improvement , firms might need to start their internationalization process earlier rather than later in their life cycle ( Sapienza et al . 2006 ) . Policy - makers may consider offering incentives to new businesses to build their structures for internationalization from the start and more importantly offer support to older firms if indeed learning from international - ization becomes more difficult with age because organizational routines are less flexible ( Hannan 1998 ; Hannan and Freeman 1984 ) . On the other hand , our findings do lend strong support to suggest that prior intent to internationalize gives organizations a chance to focus their early learning through the internationalization process . This study responds to the call for scholars to explore the role of intention in the internationalization process ( Hutzschenreuter et al . 2007 ; Khavul et al . 2010a , b ) . While past research has recognized that ongoing intent functions as a critical element to continuously propel firms through their entry into 248 C . Zheng et al . foreign markets ( Eroglu 1992 ; De Clercq et al . 2005 ) , we find that intent set at the founding and supported with resource marshaling toward internationalization contrib - utes to the firms ’ ability to benefit from their international efforts . While our research explored intent at a relatively broad level , future research might explore the process by which intent works on the learning effects . Some possibilities include determining whether the effect is a motivation for learning or simply an outcome of suggestive power , only attributed ex post . An investigation into the exact measures a firm takes to integrate learning from internationalization into the firm ’ s overall operation may also illuminate the way intent works on the learning process . It seems that identifying these measures could be particularly important for firms who are trying to learn from the diverse , complex , and heterogeneous experiences they have in international markets . Firms expecting to internationalize in the future may accelerate through the internationalization learning curve if they first communicate their intentions to organizational actors through goal setting and resource allocation . They should also benefit from placing the focus of the organization on learning from internationaliza - tion in the early years of the firm . Policy - makers may also help firms achieve this improved learning by developing programs and communicating their own political intent for firms to be early internationalizers . Educational programs , grant programs , and business support efforts could be targeted toward convincing new businesses to serve overseas markets within the first 3 years of founding . For example , in the USA , the small business development centers that service entrepreneurs at the grass roots levels could introduce the idea of overseas markets to these business people when they approach them for funding assistance . Through their small business counselors , the SBA could provide training in international marketing to new businesses and assist them in finding potential partners in foreign markets . Transferable experience Our central finding supports the idea that firms can utilize prior related experience in the domestic market to enhance their learning from their own entry into foreign markets , transferring the experience by using an analogical reasoning mechanism . The analogical reasoning mechanism that works to transfer the benefits of former related experience in domestic markets to the efforts of learning from international - ization is one of the more significant underpinnings of this study ’ s contribution to theory . Along these lines , our paper extends earlier work on international entrepreneurship in two important ways . First , ours is one of a few studies ( see also Michailova and Wilson ( 2008 ) ) to investigate the actual mechanisms of how firms learn as they internationalize . Previous studies have also emphasized the importance of organizational learning in international growth ( Zahra et al . 2000 ; Autio et al . 2000 ) , but only a few have investigated the mechanisms and have used organizational learning as a dependent variable ( Sapienza et al . ( 2005 ) are a notable exception ) . In contrast , we offer a theory and analysis of how firms learn in an international context by using a fundamentally different mechanism . Specifically , we complement earlier work on experiential learning ( Levitt and March 1988 ; Schweizer et al . 2010 ; Schwens and Kabst 2009 ) that focuses on direct encounters , and we suggest that transferable experience can help explain why new entrepreneurial firms can successfully enter foreign markets without having to wait for direct experience in Does it transfer ? Effects of pre - internationalization experience 249 international markets to accumulate . Future research could investigate other inventive learning mechanisms for firms with a direct experience disadvantage such as vicarious learning , superstitious learning , or the development of different heuristics ( Holcomb et al . 2009 ) . For entrepreneurial firms , these results have two broad implications . First , trans - ferable experience at the firm level suggests that involvement in one type of activity may affect a firm ’ s learning in another type of activity . Thus , when facing the uncertainties of the new international environment , firms can apply principles that they learned in previous related activities to their internationalization challenges . When encountering a new situation , our research suggests that firms who constantly examine whether they can draw potentially valuable lessons from previous experi - ence may find themselves at a distinct advantage over others less skilled at transfer - ring experiences . For policy - makers , our research on transferrable experience suggests that they should create opportunities for domestic and international firms to work together as a means to stimulate learning and increase the likelihood of successful internationalization by entrepreneurial firms . Limitations While our paper provides some illumination of characteristics that entrepreneurial firms from developing markets may utilize to counteract their knowledge deficits , readers / other scholars should interpret the results with caution . First , our measures of learning from internationalization are not exhaustive and could be expanded . We consider learning in terms of the outcome from internationalization on operational process ( technological , marketing , manufacturing / production ) . While we believe that our measure explores the relevant parts of a firm ’ s operations , there may be other indicators of how well firms learn that can be explored in the future . For example , achieving the desirable speed , scope , and extent of internationalization might give managers the impression that they have learned from the internationalization process and managed it well ( Zahra and George 2002b ) . In addition , our measure of strategic intent , being only a dummy variable , taps into whether or not firms deem internation - alization as a strategic priority to firms . Degrees of intent may range from weak to strong , and it would be useful for future researchers to develop continuous measures of intent . Second , our research uses survey data as our information source . We were only able to collect information from single informants from entrepreneurial firms . Although we believe that our data are reliable and free of major biases , utilizing two or more informants from each company would have triangulated the perception of organizational learning from different individuals ( different top management team members ) . Third , our research is a cross - sectional examination of firm characteristics and its learning outcomes from internationalization . While we show the characteristics of better learners here , it would be useful to see how those characteristics change with time . Over time , will the effect of transferable experience change due to accumulation of direct experi - ence ? Over time , will the effect of intent change once intent has been reinforced with either positive or negative performance feedback ? Those are promising questions for future research . It would also be useful to see whether entry mode affects the speed , extent , and depth of learning . In our sample , the majority of the firms use direct export as the mode of entry ( 90 firms and 68 . 2 % of our sample ) . Firms also use a combination of 250 C . Zheng et al . other entry modes , such as using a domestic intermediary to export ( 11 firms , 8 . 3 % of our sample ) , using an international intermediary ( 27 firms and 20 . 5 % of our sample ) , and using licensing ( one firm , 0 . 8 % of our sample ) . Also , two firms have established operations abroad , one establishing a sales subsidiary ( 0 . 8 % of our sample ) and another establishing production facilities overseas ( 0 . 8 % of our sample ) . Firms with a high control entry mode ( such as establishing foreign operations ) might be able to achieve greater learning depth and speed as greater investment overseas might lead to higher incentive to learn . Likewise , it would be interesting to understand whether the size of the foreign partner has an effect on the success with which the domestic partner learns and the transferability of experience . Finally , we control for whether firms are coming out of high technology and manufacturing on the rates at which firms internationalize ; how - ever , our study says nothing about the propensities of internationalization from different industries . Every study leaves behind a range of interesting and important questions . Our study points to a number of promising areas for future research . We hope that other researchers would extend our efforts . Conclusion Oviatt and McDougall ( 1994 , 1995 ) started the new field of international entrepre - neurship with their investigation of international entrepreneurial firms , a special breed of firms that starts an international operation when they are young and sometimes just born . Even though young organizations are free of the restrictions stemming from a long organizational history , cognitive blinders , or binding relationships ( Sapienza et al . 2006 ) , they still lack the knowledge that comes from direct experience in interna - tional markets . Given this disadvantage , entrepreneurial firms , especially those from emerging markets , may be able to enhance their ability to learn in international markets by engaging with foreign partners in domestic markets . The central contri - bution of this paper is to show that pre - internationalization intent and transferable experience have a significant effect for post - internationalization learning . We hope that our study would prompt many others to investigate other critical dimensions of how entrepreneurial firms gain international competitive advantage despite their lack of direct experience in international markets .
