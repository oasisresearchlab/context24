Technology Regimes and New Firm Formation Scott Shane R . H . Smith School of Business , University of Maryland , College Park , Maryland 20742 sshane @ rhsmith . umd . edu A t least since Schumpeter ( 1934 and 1942 ) , researchers have been interested in identifying the dimensions of technology regimes that facilitate new ﬁrm formation as a mode of technology exploitation . Using data on 1 , 397 patents assigned to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology during the 1980 – 1996 period , I show that four hypothesized dimensions of the technology regime—the age of the technical ﬁeld , the tendency of the market toward segmentation , the effectiveness of patents , and the importance of complementary assets in marketing and distribution—inﬂuence the likelihood that new technology will be exploited through ﬁrm formation . ( Entrepreneurship ; Technology Regimes ; Patents ) Introduction Under what conditions is new technology exploited through ﬁrm formation ? For 40 years , researchers have looked to market structure to answer this ques - tion ( Cohen and Levin 1989 , Kamien and Schwartz 1982 ) . For example , researchers have examined the effect of average ﬁrm size , capital availability , research and development intensity , and industry concentra - tion on new ﬁrm formation . Unfortunately , the results of the effort to explain cross - industry variation in ﬁrm formation on the basis of market structure alone are , at best , inconclusive ( Cohen and Levin 1989 ) . Evolutionary economists argue that the failure to explain this variation is the result of a lack of attention to the technological regime ( Nelson and Winter 1982 , Malerba and Orsenigo 1997 ) , or knowledge system , under which innovation occurs ( Winter 1984 ) . Unlike industrial organization economists , who argue that variation in the mode of technology exploitation is a function of ﬁrm - level competitive dynamics , evolu - tionary economists argue that variation in technology life cycles ( Utterback and Abernathy 1975 , Gort and Klepper 1982 ) and appropriability conditions ( Arrow 1962 , Levin et al . 1987 , Nelson and Winter 1982 ) account for at least some of the cross - industry varia - tion in ﬁrm formation rates . However , to date we have relatively little empir - ical evidence of how speciﬁc dimensions of the technology regime enhance or inhibit new ﬁrm for - mation . While evolutionary economists have gener - ally agreed that some industries , but not others , face technological regimes in which new ﬁrm formation is relatively common ( Acs and Audretsch 1990 , Malerba and Orsenigo 1997 ) , they have disagreed about the speciﬁc characteristics that facilitate new ﬁrm forma - tion ( see , for example , the differences between Winter 1984 and Malerba and Orsenigo 1997 ) . Moreover , efforts to gather evidence in support of the relationship between particular dimensions of technological regimes and rates of ﬁrm formation have been limited by three obstacles . First , researchers have found it difﬁcult to observe new technologies that are simultaneously at risk of exploitation by inde - pendent entrepreneurs and established ﬁrms . How - ever , if researchers examine technologies that already belong to one of these two entities , they cannot test the effect of technology regime characteristics on the propensity for inventions to be exploited through the formation of new companies . If an independent 0025 - 1909 / 01 / 4709 / 1173 $ 5 . 00 1526 - 5501 electronic ISSN Management Science © 2001 INFORMS Vol . 47 , No . 9 , September 2001 pp . 1173 – 1190 SHANE Technology Regimes and New Firm Formation entrepreneur or established ﬁrm already possesses a new technology , any examination of the effects of the technology regime will be confounded with strategic decisions already made by the entrepreneurs or ﬁrm managers . Second , researchers rarely observe ﬁrm formation but instead examine entry into industry . As a result , research on cross - industry variation on the effects of technology regime characteristics on ﬁrm forma - tion must infer the effects from empirical investi - gation of industry entry . However , as Malerba and Orsenigo ( 1996 ) explain , ﬁrm formation and indus - try entry are conceptually different . A new entrant may be an established ﬁrm that has existed for a long time in another industry . Consequently , empir - ical ﬁndings on industry entry often represent the efforts of established ﬁrms to diversify their oper - ations ( Caves 1998 ) . Although population ecology research generally overcomes this obstacle by explor - ing ﬁrm formation directly , ecological work examines ﬁrms in a single industry . Therefore , it cannot inform researchers about the effects of cross - industry varia - tion in the characteristics of technology regimes on the rate of ﬁrm formation . Third , researchers rarely observe gross ﬁrm forma - tion but instead observe ﬁrm formation net of exit . Unfortunately , net entry fails to capture the response of actors to technological opportunities in industries with a high degree of entry and exit ( Geroski 1995 ) . Although net entry captures variation in the propen - sity of entrepreneurs to form new ﬁrms to exploit opportunities , it confounds this variation with the effect of failure rates . From the examination of net ﬁrm formation rates , one does not know if cross - industry variation exists because new ﬁrms are more likely to be founded or because newly founded ﬁrms are less likely to fail . Only the examination of gross ﬁrm formation allows researchers to determine how technology regime conditions inﬂuence the likelihood that new technology will be exploited through ﬁrm formation . This study overcomes the three methodologi - cal problems outlined above to provide empiri - cal evidence about the relationship between speciﬁc dimensions of the technology regime and new ﬁrm formation . By exploring data on the 1 , 397 patents assigned to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1980 – 1996 , the study shows that four dimen - sions of the technology regime—the age of the techni - cal ﬁeld , the importance of market segmentation , the effectiveness of patents , and the importance of com - plementary assets—inﬂuence the propensity of new ﬁrms to be formed to exploit technology . The article proceeds as follows . In the next section , I review the literature on the technology regime and develop speciﬁc hypotheses for why technology life cycles and appropriability conditions inﬂuence the likelihood that an invention will be commercialized through ﬁrm formation . In the third section , I describe the dataset and the methods used for analysis . In the fourth section , I summarize the ﬁndings . In the ﬁnal section , I discuss the implications of the results for research on and the practice of entrepreneurship . Theory Development In the Schumpeterian ( Schumpeter 1934 ) framework , the invention of a new technology is an exogenous event that creates a disequilibrium in markets . By altering the equilibrium value of resources , a new technology makes it possible to recombine resources in a way that generates a surplus of revenues over costs . In the Schumpeterian context , entrepreneurs are actors who exploit opportunities to recombine resources that result from the invention of new technology . Entrepreneurs can exploit the technological oppor - tunities that result from exogenous inventions by cre - ating new ﬁrms ( Schumpeter 1942 ) . In general , an entrepreneur’s decision to establish a new ﬁrm to exploit a technology is inﬂuenced by the effectiveness of a new organization as a mechanism to generate and appropriate entrepreneurial proﬁt ( Arrow 1962 , Venkataraman 1997 ) . The technological regime in which the new ﬁrm’s exploitation effort would oper - ate affects the relative advantage or disadvantage of new ﬁrms at this activity . On average , potential entrepreneurs will respond to these cost - beneﬁt trade - offs by establishing new ﬁrms when conditions are more favorable to that mode of technology exploita - tion . Although many other factors , such the attributes of particular inventions , or the characteristics of the people making the commercialization decision , might 1174 Management Science / Vol . 47 , No . 9 , September 2001 SHANE Technology Regimes and New Firm Formation also inﬂuence the choice of the mode of exploitation , the characteristics of technological regimes will have systematic effects on whether or not new ﬁrms are formed to exploit inventions . 1 Technology Life Cycles Industry life - cycle theories argue that technologies develop along trajectories , which begin with a preparadigmatic phase and end in a paradigmatic phase ( Dosi 1982 ) . Moreover , technology develop - ment and market competition vary across the stages of the life cycle ( Utterback and Abernathy 1975 ) . As a result , the favored mode of organization to exploit a technology shifts over time . When an entrepreneur founds a new ﬁrm in response to the invention of a new technology , he or she does not possess the advantages of learn - ing , scale economies , or complementary assets ( or the disadvantages of an existing customer base ) that established companies possess . The relative advan - tages and disadvantages of these assets depend on the age of the technology and the tendency of a market toward segmentation . Technology life - cycle theories hold that new ﬁrms are the favored mode of exploita - tion when technologies are young and when markets are segmented . Age of the Technology Technology life - cycle theories argue that industries develop along similar evolutionary paths . When tech - nologies are initially developed , the markets for them are small and few ﬁrms compete to operate in them . Through a process of information diffusion , market growth accelerates over time , and new ﬁrms enter the industry . Eventually , the market becomes saturated , a shakeout ensues , and many ﬁrms exit the industry ( Gort and Klepper 1982 ) . 1 Moreover , in the particular setting in which data were collected , the decision - making process also exhibits properties of a garbage can model ( Cyert and March 1963 ) . Potential entrepreneurs search - ing for technologies come together with inventions that have been created ( Hsu and Bernstein 1997 ) . In many cases , this process results in single bidders for a given technology and no one seeking to exploit some technologies . Nevertheless , the patterns generated by technology regimes are still observed in this setting . The age of the technical ﬁeld inﬂuences the effec - tiveness of ﬁrm formation as a mode of technology exploitation . Four different arguments have been put forth to explain this life - cycle pattern . First , in the early stages of a new technology , markets are too small to justify investment by large , established ﬁrms . Instead , independent entrepreneurs with low oppor - tunity cost tend to exploit new markets . Over time , as markets grow in size , large ﬁrms become attracted to them and enter . Second , at the founding of a technical ﬁeld , all ﬁrms are new to the ﬁeld , providing no advantage to incumbency . However , as the technology matures , ﬁrms that entered ﬁrst develop learning curve advan - tages ( Nelson 1995 ) . As a result , new ﬁrms are at an increasing knowledge disadvantage as a technical ﬁeld ages . Third , the maturation of technology changes the basis for competition . As technology matures , product innovation becomes less important , and the reduction of production costs and scale economies become more important ( Pavitt and Wald 1971 ) . Therefore , over time , competitive advantage shifts to those things at which established ﬁrms are advantaged at the expense of those at which new ﬁrms excel . Fourth , complementary assets are important to competition in many industries . As technologies mature , these assets are brought under the control of established ﬁrms to reduce contracting problems . As the industry matures , the tendency of established ﬁrms to obtain control over complementary assets makes entry more difﬁcult for new ﬁrms ( Teece 1987 ) . These arguments lead to the ﬁrst hypothesis . Hypothesis H1 . The older a technical ﬁeld , the lower the likelihood that an invention will be exploited through ﬁrm formation . Market Segmentation Technologies vary on the degree to which markets for them can be segmented . For example , Klevorick et al . ( 1995 ) found that managers responsible for technol - ogy development in paints , screw machinery prod - ucts , cosmetics , and radio and television ascribed more importance to designing for market segments than did managers responsible for other types of technologies . Management Science / Vol . 47 , No . 9 , September 2001 1175 SHANE Technology Regimes and New Firm Formation The degree to which markets lend themselves to segmentation depends largely on customers’ will - ingness to trade off different attributes ( e . g . , cost , functions , reliability , size ) . For example , automo - bile technology lends itself to market segmentation because some automobile customers will prefer lower - cost – lower - performance cars , whereas others will prefer higher - cost – higher - performance cars . In contrast , medical device technologies may not lend themselves as readily to market segmentation because customers will not trade off attributes such as cost and performance . Life - cycle theories argue that new technologies tend to be exploited ﬁrst by new ﬁrms in small market seg - ments . The lack of performance reliability and high costs mean that new technology will tend to start in small segments where its unique performance advan - tages are critical ( Utterback and Kim 1984 ) . These technologies later spread to mainstream markets after their superiority has been demonstrated in the initial segment ( Christiansen and Bower 1996 ) . When markets are segmented , new ﬁrms often enter to exploit inventions . Large , established ﬁrms allocate their resources to satisfy the demands of their major customers ( Christiansen and Bower 1996 ) . Given the small size of the segments in which the new technology is initially exploited , the application of the new technology to the initial segment does not pro - vide sufﬁcient revenue to justify investment by estab - lished companies . Because they focus on mainstream customers , established ﬁrms cede niche markets for the new technology to new ﬁrms with low opportu - nity cost . Thus , in segmented markets , new ﬁrms can obtain a foothold for a new technology before facing competition from established ﬁrms . When markets are not segmented , however , new ﬁrms face immediate competition from estab - lished ﬁrms . In unsegmented markets , large estab - lished ﬁrms pursue new technologies immediately because these technologies affect the needs of their major customers ( Christiansen and Bower 1996 ) . The interest of major customers means that the new tech - nology provides sufﬁcient potential revenue to jus - tify investment by established companies . As a result , established ﬁrms do not cede unsegmented mar - kets to new ﬁrms , and new ﬁrms cannot obtain a foothold before facing competition from established ﬁrms . Consequently , new technologies are more dif - ﬁcult to exploit through the creation of new ﬁrms in markets that do not tend toward segmentation than in markets that do . This argument leads to the second hypothesis . Hypothesis H2 . The more a market tends toward seg - mentation , the higher the likelihood that an invention will be exploited through ﬁrm formation . Appropriability The willingness to exploit an invention depends on the ability to appropriate its value ( Arrow 1962 ) . Appropriability is the property of knowledge and the environment in which it operates that allows an invention to be protected against imitation ( Dosi 1988 ) . The favored mode of organization to appropri - ate the returns to the exploitation of new technology depends on the effectiveness of patents and the mag - nitude of complementary assets in an industry . Appropriability arguments hold that the propensity of entrepreneurs to exploit new technologies through ﬁrm formation is greater when patents are effec - tive and complementary assets are unimportant to the generation of competitive advantage . When an entrepreneur founds a ﬁrm in response to the devel - opment of a new technology , the new ﬁrm typically does not yet possess complementary assets , like a dis - tribution system or specialized manufacturing , which provide a competitive advantage ( Teece 1987 ) . The more effectively that entrepreneurs can protect a new technology against appropriation by competitors dur - ing the development of the new ﬁrm’s value chain , the more likely that they will be to form new ﬁrms . The ability to protect a new technology against appro - priation , in turn , depends on the effectiveness of intel - lectual property protection and the magnitude of the complementary assets that need to be developed . Effectiveness of Patents Mechanisms to prevent imitation include legal rights of protection . Patents are the strongest legal form of protection against imitation because they pro - vide inventors with the right to exclude others from 1176 Management Science / Vol . 47 , No . 9 , September 2001 SHANE Technology Regimes and New Firm Formation practicing duplicative inventions ( Teece 1998 ) . There - fore , legal rights of production depend largely on the effectiveness of patents . Research has shown that patent effectiveness varies across technologies ( Levin et al . 1987 ) . In some ﬁelds , patents can be invented around at low cost whereas in others , they provide strong protection for their dura - tion ( Teece 1987 ) . In ﬁelds in which patent protection is ineffective , new ﬁrms have difﬁculty reaping the beneﬁts of new technology because their new knowl - edge dissipates quickly to competitors who are often better able to exploit it ( Von Hippel 1982 ) . Effective patent protection increases the likelihood that a new technology will be exploited through the creation of a new ﬁrm . First , effective patent pro - tection allows the developer of the new technology to develop the value chain before the knowledge of the new technology dissipates to competitors ( Teece 1987 ) . In particular , the possession of a strong patent position provides time to raise money from capital markets ( Lerner 1994 ) . Because new ﬁrms lack exist - ing cash ﬂow to ﬁnance investment , this time win - dow is more important for the efforts of new ﬁrms to exploit new technologies than for similar efforts by established ﬁrms . Second , effective patent protection provides the ﬁrm with the time to adapt the new technology to market needs . New technologies often turn out to have signiﬁcant value but are initially commercial - ized for the wrong market segment or with the wrong design . Strong patent protection allows a ﬁrm to come to market with the wrong product but have the time to alter the technology to market needs before com - petitors can imitate it ( Teece 1987 ) . Because new ﬁrms lack the information about customer preferences that established ﬁrms have developed over time , this time window for adaptation is more important to new ﬁrms than to established ﬁrms . Third , effective patent protection allows a new ﬁrm to compete on the basis of differentiation rather than on the basis of costs . When patent protection is inef - fective , an imitator can copy a ﬁrst mover’s novel design . This ability to copy allows large , established ﬁrms to shift competition to manufacturing costs , at which they generally have an advantage over new ﬁrms . However , when patent protection is effective , the new ﬁrm can offset the imitator’s manufactur - ing cost advantage by maintaining competition on the basis of its superior technology . Consequently , the new ﬁrm can avoid competition on the basis of factors at which it is disadvantaged . This argument leads to the third hypothesis . Hypothesis H3 . The greater the effectiveness of patents in an industry , the higher the likelihood that an invention will be exploited through ﬁrm formation . Complementary Assets In many cases , effective legal protection of a new technology is difﬁcult to obtain , and other ﬁrms who have better manufacturing or distribution assets can imitate the invention . If the invention can be copied easily and the imitator can provide more or better attributes at a lower price , the imitator will capture the returns that result from the inventor’s technology ( Teece 1987 ) . When a technology itself is difﬁcult to protect , the ﬁrm must develop alternative barriers to imitation to appropriate the value of the invention ( Teece 1998 ) . Teece ( 1987 ) has explained that these alternative bar - riers can be created if the invention is used along with complementary assets , such as specialized manufac - turing , a distribution system , or after - sales support . These complementary assets cannot be easily imitated because they result from a process of learning - by - doing that involves the interaction of people from different parts of the organization ( Teece 1992 ) . By bundling the invention with these hard - to - imitate complementary assets , the inventor can protect the invention . Complementary assets are difﬁcult to access through market mechanisms because they are often specialized with the new technology . Specialization creates asset speciﬁcity , which makes it important to bring both assets both under the control of a sin - gle ﬁrm ( Williamson 1985 ) . The tendency of estab - lished ﬁrms to acquire control over complementary assets to mitigate bargaining problems makes it difﬁ - cult for new ﬁrms to contract for these assets in the market place ( Teece 1987 ) . Consequently , new ﬁrms often must build complementary assets from scratch or incur the cost of establishing strategic alliances or partnerships to obtain them . Management Science / Vol . 47 , No . 9 , September 2001 1177 SHANE Technology Regimes and New Firm Formation The greater the importance of complementary assets in marketing and distribution to competitive advantage in the industry , the lower the likelihood that a new technology will be exploited through ﬁrm formation . When complementary assets in marketing and distribution are important to competitive advan - tage in the industry , existing ﬁrms with these assets already in place will be advantaged relative to new ﬁrms , who must build these assets from scratch or contract with third parties to obtain them . People will be less willing to found new ﬁrms to exploit new tech - nology when complementary assets in marketing and distribution are important to capturing the returns to new technology because they will expect to be less likely to capture the returns from the exploitation of that technology . This argument leads to the fourth hypothesis . Hypothesis H4 . The more important complementary assets in marketing and distribution are in an industry , the lower the likelihood that an invention will be exploited through ﬁrm formation . Methodology Sample This study explores the incidence of ﬁrm formation as the mode of exploitation for the population of 1 , 397 patents issued to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology between 1980 and 1996 for inventions by members of the MIT community that made material use of university resources . I examine MIT inventions as my sample for sev - eral reasons . First , patented inventions provide a recorded population of inventions that are identiﬁed before the mode of exploitation of those inventions is determined . Examination of the mode of exploita - tion before the exploitation decision has been made reduces the risk of selection bias that will occur if one mode of exploitation is harder to identify than the other . This is typically the case with technology exploitation through ﬁrm formation . Because new ﬁrms both have higher failure rates than established ﬁrms and are less likely to be recorded in publicly available sources , technology exploitation efforts by new ﬁrms are more difﬁcult to identify than tech - nology exploitation efforts by established ﬁrms . Con - sequently , examination of the mode of exploitation after the exploitation decision has been made typi - cally results in a selection bias in which efforts by new ﬁrms to exploit new technology are undercounted rel - ative to similar efforts by established ﬁrms . Second , to predict ﬁrm formation as a mode of invention exploitation , one must identify a popula - tion of inventions that are simultaneously at risk of exploitation by both new and established ﬁrms . Uni - versity inventions provide a group of new technolo - gies simultaneously at risk of exploitation through both modes because universities seek to license their technologies to both established ﬁrms and indepen - dent entrepreneurs . In contrast , inventions developed by established ﬁrms and independent entrepreneurs are not simultaneously at risk of exploitation through ﬁrm formation and by established ﬁrms . Inventions made by established ﬁrms are not at risk of exploita - tion through new ﬁrm formation until the established ﬁrms have decided not to pursue them ( generating a biased sample ) . Similarly , inventions made by inde - pendent entrepreneurs are not at risk of exploitation by established ﬁrms until the entrepreneurs decide to license those inventions to other ﬁrms ( again gen - erating a biased sample ) . By exploring university inventions , I can examine the mode of technology exploitation absent the biases that would occur from the examination of patents belonging to established ﬁrms or independent entrepreneurs ( Henderson et al . 1998 ) . Third , patented inventions are a relatively homoge - nous group of new technological opportunities because a patent must meet the patent ofﬁce stan - dard for usefulness , novelty , and value ( Malerba and Orsenigo 1996 ) . The universe of all technological opportunities is subject to much greater heterogene - ity than the universe of patented inventions because unpatented inventions do not need to meet patent ofﬁce standards . This heterogeneity increases the probability that unobserved factors inﬂuence the ﬁrm formation decision . By exploring a pool of patented inventions , I can minimize the variance in unobserved characteristics that are likely to inﬂuence the tendency to found ﬁrms , and therefore reduce the likelihood of biased estimation in the regression analysis . 1178 Management Science / Vol . 47 , No . 9 , September 2001 SHANE Technology Regimes and New Firm Formation Analysis Ordinary least squares regression is inappropriate for count dependent variables that have large numbers of zero observations and remaining observations tak - ing the form of small positive numbers . Therefore , I employ Poisson regression as the analytical technique for this study . Poisson regression is appropriate to examine the incidence of ﬁrm formation from patent data because this statistical technique is designed for maximum likelihood estimation of the number of occurrences of nonnegative counts of events . More - over , tests of the goodness of ﬁt chi - square indicate that , given the models examined , one can accept that the data are Poisson distributed . Because I seek to incorporate information on annual changes in some of the covariates , I use pooled cross - sectional time series Poisson regression analysis to examine the number of new ﬁrms formed annually to exploit each MIT invention . I examine the data as a series of patent - years and predict the incidence rate of new ﬁrm formation per patent - year on the basis of several covariates , which are speciﬁed below . Dependent Variable : Firm Formation The MIT Technology Licensing Ofﬁce maintains records of the university’s inventions and its licensees , and I was able to use these records to code ﬁrm for - mation . Each patent was observed from its year of issue through 1996 . In each year , a patent could be licensed or not . If the patent was licensed , the license could be issued to a nonproﬁt organization , a venture capital ﬁrm , an established ﬁrm ( of varying size ) , or a new ﬁrm . I deﬁned ﬁrm formation as occurring in a given year if the invention was licensed to a for - proﬁt ﬁrm that did not exist as a legal entity in the previous year . Only the initial start - up patents were deﬁned as lead - ing to ﬁrm formation . If a start - up returned to MIT to license a patent in a later year , that licensing effort was not deﬁned as new ﬁrm formation because the ﬁrm already existed as a legal entity in a previous year . Because MIT’s licensing agreements do not per - mit the licensing of future inventions , the assumption that the intellectual property licensed at the found - ing of the ﬁrm represents the set of “start - up” patents seems valid . The 1 , 397 patents led to 401 ﬁrm forma - tion licensing efforts over the observation period . Readers should note that the MIT data are not biased toward observance of ﬁrm formation . Licens - ing to established ﬁrms is actually a much more com - mon occurrence than is licensing to a new ﬁrm . The 1 , 397 patents led to 631 established ﬁrm licensing efforts ( excluding licenses to venture capital ﬁrms and nonproﬁt organizations ) during the observation period . Therefore , this sample provides a relatively conservative setting in which to examine the rate of ﬁrm formation . Yale Measures No publicly available measures capture three of the dimensions of the technology regime explored in this study ( the age of the technology class is the exception ) . To measure the other three dimensions , I use independent variables developed from the Yale study on industrial research and development , which assembled data on intersectoral differences in Schumpeterian patterns of innovation . Therefore , I summarize brieﬂy the methodology used to collect data for that study . 2 Levin et al . ( 1987 ) asked 650 high - level R & D managers from 130 different lines of busi - ness to answer questions about technological change in the line of business in which they operated . The respondents were asked to serve as expert observers of their line of business rather than as representatives of their ﬁrms and were asked to report central ten - dencies in the form of a series of Likert scale items that ranged from one to seven . The researchers con - structed line of business mean scores for each item on the basis of the average responses of the respondents from each line of business . I use these line of business mean scores to mea - sure several dimensions of the technology regimes , as described below . To map the Levin et al . ( 1987 ) mea - sures to SIC codes , I used the SIC code concordance that they developed . When SIC codes overlapped with more than one industry in Levin et al . ( l987 ) , the measures were averaged across those industries . Using the Yale measures to construct the indepen - dent variables has several important advantages for 2 Further information is available in Levin et al . ( 1987 ) . Management Science / Vol . 47 , No . 9 , September 2001 1179 SHANE Technology Regimes and New Firm Formation this study . First , unlike many studies that sample entrepreneurs about their choices , the Yale study did not include any respondents from start - up ventures . The tendency of researchers to ask entrepreneurs about their environment is problematic . Because peo - ple respond to questions about their environment in ways that are consistent with the actions that they have taken , these self - reports result in ex - post ratio - nalization . Consequently , correlations between the environmental measures and the dependent variables often are artifacts of the data collection process . By using a source of information about the environment that does not depend on entrepreneurs’ self - reports , I can mitigate this problem . Second , the authors of the Yale study took sev - eral steps to ensure reliability and validity . The interpretability , reliability , and validity of the mea - sures were established through a pretest with managers from diverse businesses . Moreover , to mit - igate sources of intraindustry heterogeneity in the responses to questions , the respondents were asked to identify major innovations in their industry . The respondents generally agreed on those innovations . Furthermore , the value and robustness of these mea - sures has been shown in many subsequent studies ( e . g . , Cohen and Levinthal 1990 , Levin et al . 1985 , Klevorick et al . 1995 ) . Third , the sample of industries in Levin et al . ( 1987 ) was representative of sectors in which ﬁrms engage in research and development activity , making the sam - ple appropriate for a study that looks at the forma - tion of new ﬁrms to exploit university inventions . Moreover , the interindustry differences captured in these data were robust to aggregation to the 25 indus - tries measured by the National Science Foundation , providing further evidence of their representativeness ( Levin et al . 1987 ) . Nevertheless , the use of Yale Survey measures requires making an important assumption about the characteristics of a technology regime . Because the Yale Survey data were gathered at one point in time , this study must assume that the relative level of market segmentation , the degree of patent effective - ness , and the importance of complementary assets in marketing have remained constant across industries between 1980 and 1996 . Some evidence supports mak - ing this assumption . Cohen and Levin ( 1989 ) explain that appropriability conditions are stable , enduring drivers of technical change . Cross - industry differ - ences in such factors as patent strength do not vary signiﬁcantly over time because they are a function of the underlying nature of technology in different lines of business . For example , biotechnology patents are fundamentally stronger than electrical device patents because the slightest changes in molecular structure can radically change the performance of a biological agent , whereas relatively major changes in the design of an electrical device can be accomplished without changing the functioning of the device . Despite argu - ments in favor of the time invariance of the three technology regime measures examined with the Yale measures , however , readers are cautioned that their time invariance is an assumption . No empirical evi - dence has examined the Yale measures’ intertemporal stability . Predictor Variables Age of the Technical Field . I measure the age of the technical ﬁeld as the natural log of the number of years since the USPTO established the three - digit patent class . Market Segmentation . I measure the importance of market segmentation in an industry by using the Levin et al . ( 1987 ) item : “designing products for spe - ciﬁc market segment” under the heading “to what extent have the following technological activities been engaged in consistently and repeatedly in this line of business ? ” This item is measured on a Likert scale that ranged from one to seven , with one equal to “of no importance in this line of business” and seven equal to “very important in this line of business . ” Effectiveness of Patents . I measure the effectiveness of patents as a mechanism to appropriate the bene - ﬁts of innovation using a four - item , evenly weighted scale derived from Levin et al . ( 1987 ) . The ﬁrst two items were responses to the following question : “In this line of business , how effective is each of the fol - lowing means of capturing and protecting the com - petitive advantages of new or improved production processes ? ” The ﬁrst item was “patents to prevent 1180 Management Science / Vol . 47 , No . 9 , September 2001 SHANE Technology Regimes and New Firm Formation competitors from duplicating the process . ” The sec - ond item was “patents to secure royalty income . ” The third and fourth items were responses to the following question : “In this line of business , how effective is each of the following means of captur - ing and protecting the competitive advantages of new or improved products ? ” The third item was “patents to prevent competitors from duplicating the prod - uct . ” The fourth item was “patents to secure roy - alty income . ” All four items were measured along a seven - point Likert scale from one equals “not at all effective” to seven equals “very effective . ” Measured across the 129 lines of business for which the scores were available , this scale had a Cronbach’s alpha of 0 . 78 . The use of these items to measure patent effec - tiveness has been validated by Levin et al . ( l987 ) and Cockburn and Griliches ( 1988 ) . Complementary Assets . I measured the importance of complementary assets in marketing and distribu - tion using a two - item , evenly weighted scale derived from Levin et al . ( l987 ) . The ﬁrst item was a response to the following question : “In this line of business , how effective is each of the following means of cap - turing and protecting the competitive advantages of new or improved production processes ? ” The item was “superior sales or service efforts . ” The second item was a response to the following question : “In this line of business , how effective is each of the following means of capturing and protecting the competitive advantages of new or improved products ? ” The item was “superior sales or service efforts . ” Both items were measured along a seven - point Likert scale from one equals “not at all effective” to seven equals “very effective . ” Measured across the 129 lines of business for which the scores were available , this scale had a Cronbach’s alpha of 0 . 65 . The use of these items to measure complementary assets has been validated by Levin et al . ( 1987 ) . Control Variables Previous researchers have identiﬁed a variety of alternative dimensions of industry that inﬂuence the incidence of ﬁrm formation . I control for these dimen - sions to show that the hypothesized effects of the technology regime exist over and above factors iden - tiﬁed by previous research . Capital Availability . Prior research has shown that ﬁrm formation is less common when market imper - fections make it difﬁcult for entrepreneurs to obtain ﬁnancing ( Cohen and Levin 1989 ) . I measure capital availability as the annual amount of venture capital funding in the industry as a percentage of industry asset size , using data obtained from Securities Data Corporation’s venture capital database and various years of the Census of Manufacturers . Firm Size . Prior research has shown that large aver - age ﬁrm size discourages ﬁrm formation by raising entry costs ( Audretsch 1995 ) . In addition , high levels of ﬁrm size provide established ﬁrms with the mar - ket control necessary to appropriate the beneﬁts of invention ( Teece 1992 ) . I measured the average size of ﬁrms in the industry as the annual average number of employees per ﬁrm , using data from various years of the Census of Manufacturers . Concentration . Previous research has shown that high levels of industry concentration should discour - age ﬁrm formation because concentration makes it easier for incumbents to collude and to attack new entrants ( Geroski 1995 ) . I measured industry concen - tration as the annual market share of the four biggest ﬁrms in the industry , using data from various years of the Census of Manufacturers . Research and Development Expenditures . Galbraith ( 1956 ) and Scherer ( 1980 ) argue that large , established ﬁrms in more research and development intensive industries should undertake technology exploitation because large ﬁrms can achieve greater economies of scope in R & D . In addition , complementarities between R & D and other activities , such as distribu - tion , provide an advantage to established ﬁrms in R & D intensive industries ( Cohen and Levin 1989 ) . Finally , because R & D is inherently uncertain , the large , diversiﬁed ﬁrm has an advantage in R & D inten - sive industries because it has more market opportuni - ties in which to exploit new knowledge ( Nelson 1959 ) . I measured R & D intensity in an industry as research and development expenditures as a percentage of the added value of industry shipments annually , using data obtained from various years of Science and Engi - neering Indicators and the Census of Manufacturers . University Share . I measured the share of total patents assigned to universities in the three - digit Management Science / Vol . 47 , No . 9 , September 2001 1181 SHANE Technology Regimes and New Firm Formation patent class to which the patent belonged for the year the patent was issued . I control for the uni - versity share of inventions because universities are more important to technical advance in some techni - cal ﬁelds than in others , and the importance of uni - versity inventions is associated with the founding of new companies in the ﬁelds in which university tech - nology is more important ( Klevorick et al . l995 ) . Time . I control for the effect of the time of the invention through the use of four dummy variables for the period in which the patent was ﬁled because changes in Federal law and MIT policy over time have changed the incentives for people to exploit uni - versity inventions ( Henderson et al . 1998 ) . The ﬁrst dummy variable controls for the period 1980 – 1983 , the second for the period 1984 – 1986 , the third for the period 1987 – 1989 , and the fourth for the period 1990 – 1996 . The omitted period is for patents ﬁled before 1980 . In 1980 , Congress passed the Bayh - Dole Act , which gave universities the right to keep income from inven - tions that resulted from federally funded research , increasing the incentive for universities to license their inventions ( Henderson et al . 1998 ) . In 1984 , Congress passed Public Law 98 - 620 , which increased the range of inventions from which universities could proﬁt , and the ease with which they could transfer property rights to others , further increasing the incen - tive for universities to license . In 1987 , MIT agreed to take equity in partial lieu of royalties for compa - nies in which a faculty member held equity , reducing the upfront cost to exploit MIT intellectual property . In 1990 , MIT allowed inventors taking equity in a company to retain their share of MIT’s cash royalties , making it more lucrative for inventors to have their inventions licensed . Results The descriptive statistics and bivariate correlations for the independent variables are reported in Tables 1 and 2 , respectively . As Table 2 shows , the highest correlation between any two of the independent variables is r = − 0 (cid:1) 51 between R & D intensity and complementary assets . The moderately high correlations shown in the matrix demonstrate that the independent variables Table 1 Descriptive Statistics Variable Mean Std . Dev .

Although these correlations do not create multicollinearity problems that hamper the statistical results , they suggest that none of the factors that pre - dict ﬁrm formation are completely independent . Table 3 predicts the likelihood of ﬁrm formation . I provide three models . Model 1 predicts the likelihood of ﬁrm formation on the basis of the year of patent ﬁling and the university share of patents issued . Overall this model is signiﬁcant ( chi - square = 181 (cid:1) 86 , p < 0 (cid:1) 0001 ) . As Model 1 shows , the time of patent ﬁl - ing has a strong effect on the incidence of ﬁrm for - mation . Patents ﬁled between 1980 and 1983 had a times 1 . 89 greater incidence of ﬁrm formation than patents ﬁled before 1980 ( p < 0 (cid:1) 01 ) . For patents ﬁled between 1984 and 1986 , this incidence of ﬁrm forma - tion was 2 . 11 times greater than patents ﬁled before 1980 ( p < 0 (cid:1) 0001 ) . Patents ﬁled between 1987 and 1989 , had a 3 . 74 times greater incidence of ﬁrm formation than did patents ﬁled before 1980 ( p < 0 (cid:1) 0001 ) , and patents ﬁled between 1990 and 1996 had a 6 . 25 greater incidence of ﬁrm formation than did patents ﬁled before 1980 ( p < 0 (cid:1) 0001 ) . Thus , the results show a sig - niﬁcant and robust pattern of increasing likelihood of ﬁrm formation over time . This result is consistent with prior research on entrepreneurship that demon - strates a similar time trend ( Gartner and Shane 1995 ) 1182 Management Science / Vol . 47 , No . 9 , September 2001 SHANE Technology Regimes and New Firm Formation Table 2 The Correlation Matrix Variables 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 1 .

In addition , the results show that increases in the university share of patents in the three - digit patent class in which the patent is found increase the incidence of ﬁrm formation ( IRR = 1 (cid:1) 04 , p < 0 (cid:1) 0001 ) . This result is consistent with prior research on tech - nology transfer out of universities , which shows that Table 3 Poisson Regressions Predicting the Incidence of New Firm Formation : 1980 – 1996 Model 1 Model 2 Model 3 Variables IRR ( S .

Model 2 adds the industry control variables . The inclusion of these variables generates a good ﬁtting model ( chi - square = 193 (cid:1) 01 , p < 0 (cid:1) 0001 ) . However , the results are counter to those expected from previous research . In contrast to the predicted effect , research Management Science / Vol . 47 , No . 9 , September 2001 1183 SHANE Technology Regimes and New Firm Formation and development intensity increases the incidence of ﬁrm formation ( IRR = 1 (cid:1) 04 , p < 0 (cid:1) 01 ) ( although this result is not robust to the inclusion of the technology regime variables ) . Moreover , two other variables that have been argued to inﬂuence the likelihood of ﬁrm formation , capital availability ( IRR = 0 (cid:1) 99 , p > 0 (cid:1) 87 ) and average ﬁrm size ( IRR = 1 (cid:1) 00 , p > 0 (cid:1) 67 ) , have no signiﬁcant effect on the incidence of ﬁrm formation . Furthermore , the effect of the four - ﬁrm concentration ratio—which , as expected , reduces the incidence of ﬁrm formation ( IRR = 0 (cid:1) 98 , p < 0 (cid:1) 05 ) —is not robust to the subsequent inclusion of the technology regime variables . Model 3 adds the predictor variables . The inclu - sion of these variables generates a good ﬁtting model ( chi - square = 255 (cid:1) 94 , p < 0 (cid:1) 0001 ) . Moreover , the results support the four hypotheses . Consistent with hypoth - esis one , the older the technology class , the lower the incidence of ﬁrm formation ( IRR = 0 (cid:1) 71 , p < 0 (cid:1) 0001 ) . Consistent with hypothesis two , the more that a line of business tends toward market segmentation , the higher the incidence of ﬁrm formation ( IRR = 1 (cid:1) 31 , p < 0 (cid:1) 01 ) . Consistent with hypothesis three , the greater the effectiveness of patents in a line of business , the greater the incidence of ﬁrm formation ( IRR = 1 (cid:1) 43 , p < 0 (cid:1) 001 ) . Consistent with hypothesis four , the greater the importance of complementary assets in marketing and distribution in a line of business , the lower the incidence of ﬁrm formation ( IRR = 0 (cid:1) 66 , p < 0 (cid:1) 01 ) . Because the results shown in Table 3 clearly indicate that the time period has an effect on ﬁrm formation , I sought to determine if the effects of the technological regime variables were the same across all of the time periods examined . I examined a series of interaction effects between each of the four time period variables and each of the four technology regime predictor variables . 3 Given the potential for multicollinearity if more than one interaction between a time period vari - able and a technology regime predictor is included in the same regression model , I examined each of the 16 3 I examine interaction effects rather than examining different time periods in different regression models because the number of ﬁrm formation events is too low for this analysis to have strong statis - tical power when the data are divided into separate time periods . interaction effects in a separate regression , controlling for all the other variables in Table 3 Model 3 ( except for the other time period variables ) . Of the 16 interaction effects , 3 were signiﬁcant at the p < 0 (cid:1) 10 level or better . The interaction between the 1987 – 1989 time period and market segmentation had a signiﬁcant negative effect on ﬁrm formation ( IRR = 0 (cid:1) 41 , p < 0 (cid:1) 0001 ) , while the main effects for the 1987 – 1989 time period ( IRR = 173 (cid:1) 24 , p < 0 (cid:1) 0001 ) , and market segmentation ( IRR = 1 (cid:1) 52 , p < 0 (cid:1) 01 ) remained positive and signiﬁcant . The interaction between the 1984 – 1986 time period and class age had a signiﬁ - cant negative effect on ﬁrm formation ( IRR = 0 (cid:1) 66 , p < 0 (cid:1) 01 ) , while the main effect for the class age vari - able ( IRR = 0 (cid:1) 75 , p < 0 (cid:1) 0001 ) remained negative and signiﬁcant , and the main effect for the 1984 – 1986 time period ( IRR = 1 (cid:1) 93 , p < 0 (cid:1) 05 ) remained positive and signiﬁcant . The interaction between the 1990 – 1996 time period and class age had a signiﬁcant positive effect on ﬁrm formation ( IRR = 1 (cid:1) 49 , p < 0 (cid:1) 0001 ) , while the main effect for the class age variable ( IRR = 0 (cid:1) 62 , p < 0 (cid:1) 0001 ) remained negative and signiﬁcant , and the main effect for the 1990 – 1996 time period ( IRR = 1 (cid:1) 23 , p > 0 (cid:1) 10 ) lost signiﬁcance . The results of this ex - post analysis suggest that the relationships between the technology regime vari - ables and ﬁrm formation remain largely constant over the 1980 – 1996 period , rather than implying that the technology regime evolves over time . Although the fundamental assumption that industry tenden - cies toward market segmentation , patent effective - ness , and importance of complementary assets in marketing remain untested and could explain the shifts in ﬁrm formation over time if they exhibit intertemporal variation , the results are consistent with the explanation that the increasing level of ﬁrm formation over time results from factors outside the technology regime framework . Likely candidates include the increased acceptability of entrepreneurial activity among members of the university commu - nity , shifting incentives toward and resources for ﬁrm formation to exploit university inventions , and a shift in the locus of technology expertise toward university personnel . 1184 Management Science / Vol . 47 , No . 9 , September 2001 SHANE Technology Regimes and New Firm Formation Discussion By examining data on the population of MIT inventions over the 1980 – 1996 period and control - ling for several dimensions of industry , the time period , and the importance of universities to technical advance in the ﬁeld , this article shows that four dimensions of the technology regime inﬂuence the likelihood that an invention will be exploited through ﬁrm formation . Speciﬁcally , ﬁrm formation is more likely when technical ﬁelds are younger , when the market tends toward segmentation , in lines of busi - ness in which patents are more effective , and in lines of business in which complementary assets in market - ing and distribution are less important . The design of the study adds conﬁdence to the results . The study examines the effect of differ - ent dimensions of the technology regime before the exploitation decision is made , mitigating the prob - lem of sampling on the dependent variable that undermines many studies that attempt to explore this question . It also examines university patents , which allows for the investigation of inventions that are simultaneously at risk of exploitation by new ﬁrm formation and by established ﬁrm pursuit . In addi - tion , by examining patents from a single university , the study limits the variance in the types of techno - logical opportunities and types of entrepreneurs that exploit them . This reduces the potential for bias from unobserved heterogeneity in the tendency to found ﬁrms . Furthermore , the regression analyses account for variation in other dimensions of industries , the importance of universities to the advance of the tech - nical ﬁeld , and period effects . Limitations This study is not without limitations . First , it mea - sures several dimensions of technology regime by using semantic scale scores taken from a relatively small survey of research and development managers . In responding to the survey , the experts’ perceptions of the sectoral averages might have been inﬂuenced by the ﬁrm in which they worked . Moreover , they may have had difﬁculty accurately responding to Likert scales that lacked universal objective anchors . Although I attempt to mitigate these problems by conﬁrming that the results are robust to measure - ment of the dimensions of technology regime by both multiple - item scales and single - item measures ( not reported here ) , some of the constructs cannot be mea - sured both ways . Consequently , the dimensions of technology regime are likely measured with error . Second , the Yale survey was conducted between 1983 and 1984 . The one - time nature of this survey requires the covariates taken from the survey to be treated as time invariant . In a review of empirical studies of market structure and innovation , Cohen and Levin ( 1989 ) justify this approach , arguing that appropriability conditions are stable and enduring drivers of technical change that are determined by the underlying nature of technology in different lines of business . However , no empirical evidence has exam - ined the intertemporal stability of the Yale measures . Therefore , readers are cautioned that the validity of the ﬁndings presented here may be undermined if the attributes of technology sectors captured by these measures are not time invariant . Third , the comparison of the effects of the tech - nology regime and other dimensions of industry on ﬁrm formation is limited by the interrelation - ships between these factors . As Table 2 shows , sig - niﬁcant correlations exist between the dimensions of the technology regime and other dimensions of industry . The existence of these correlations demon - strates the limitations of empirical tests to compete the two perspectives . Because technology regimes and market structure are related in ways that we do not yet understand completely , the explanation of their respective effects on ﬁrm formation cannot be generated solely by placing all of the factors linearly on the right - hand side of a regression equation . 4 Fourth , the study examines only those inven - tions patented by a single university : MIT . There - fore , the results presented here are conditional on the patentability of an invention , MIT’s decision to ﬁle for a patent , and the invention’s assignment to MIT . If ﬁrm formation rates to exploit inventions in ﬁelds 4 This design may suffer from the limitation of unfair comparison . The measures of market structure may be less ﬁne - grained than the measures of technology regime , making the market structure variables appear to be less predictive . Management Science / Vol . 47 , No . 9 , September 2001 1185 SHANE Technology Regimes and New Firm Formation in which patenting is possible are systematically dif - ferent than those in which patenting is not possi - ble , if ﬁrm formation rates for inventions that MIT does not patent are systematically different than those for which MIT patents , or if ﬁrm formation rates to exploit inventions patented by MIT are systematically different from those for inventions patented by other entities , then the results presented here may not gen - eralize to other settings . Despite these signiﬁcant lim - itations , the study provides empirical evidence that several dimensions of technology regime inﬂuence the rate of ﬁrm formation . These results suggest the value of further research on this question . Implications for Research The central implication of this article is straightfor - ward . The tendency for an invention to be exploited through ﬁrm creation varies with the attributes of the technology regime in which it is found . The study provides direct empirical support for the argu - ments of evolutionary economists that cross - industry variation in technology life cycles ( Utterback and Abernathy 1975 , Gort and Klepper 1982 ) and appro - priability conditions ( Arrow 1962 , Levin et al . 1987 , Nelson and Winter 1982 ) inﬂuence the likelihood that ﬁrm formation will be used as a mode of exploitation of an invention ( Winter 1984 ) . The ﬁnding that speciﬁc dimensions of the technol - ogy regime inﬂuence cross - industry variation in the incidence of ﬁrm formation as a mode of technol - ogy exploitation is important because the failure to explain this variation on the basis of market struc - ture has led many researchers to invoke unique indus - try effects to explain why some industries , such as computer software , have high rates of ﬁrm for - mation , whereas other industries , such as chemi - cals , do not . However , the concept of technology regimes provides a more parsimonious and theoreti - cally grounded explanation for between - industry dif - ferences in the use of ﬁrm formation as a mode of technology exploitation than the invocation of unique industry effects . Because industry dummy variables serve merely as proxies for the characteris - tics of technological regimes that underlie the indus - try , researchers can make progress in understanding the nature of Schumpeterian patterns of ﬁrm forma - tion by explaining industry differences on the basis of particular industry attributes rather than by the “chemicals” or “software” dummy . The results also extend existing research on Schumpeterian patterns of ﬁrm formation by provid - ing empirical evidence that ﬁrm formation rates are inﬂuenced by factors other than research and devel - opment intensity , capital availability , ﬁrm size , and concentration . In particular , the results reconcile two important contradictory ﬁndings from prior studies of the relationship of market structure and ﬁrm for - mation . First , the study extends to the domain of new ﬁrm formation the argument that the effect of industry concentration on innovative activity is an artifact of unobserved heterogeneity in dimensions of the technology regime ( Cohen and Levin 1989 ) . The results here demonstrate that in the absence of con - trols for the effects of technology regime , industry concentration reduces new ﬁrm formation . However , once the technology regime is properly controlled , industry concentration no longer has the predicted effect . This result supports prior research on innova - tion and technological change , which argues that mar - ket structure is not an exogenous driver of innovative activity . Second , the study reconciles studies that have shown that research and development intensity poses a barrier to new ﬁrm formation ( Cohen and Levin 1989 , Orr 1974 , Scherer 1980 ) with studies that have shown that ﬁrm formation is higher in R & D intensive industries ( Bound et al . 1984 , Cremer and Sirbu 1978 , Highﬁeld and Smiley 1987 ) . 5 The coefﬁcient on R & D intensity shown in Model 2 is consistent with studies ﬁnding that start - up activity is higher in R & D inten - sive industries . However , when the effects of technol - ogy regimes are included in Model 3 , the coefﬁcient on R & D intensity becomes negative . This effect sug - gests that entrepreneurs found ﬁrms because of the opportunities that exist when markets are segmented , patents are effective , complementary assets in market - ing are relatively unimportant , and the technical ﬁeld is young . High levels of R & D intensity are correlated 5 The author thanks an anonymous reviewer for alerting him to this observation . 1186 Management Science / Vol . 47 , No . 9 , September 2001 SHANE Technology Regimes and New Firm Formation with these dimensions of the technology regime but actually inhibit ﬁrm formation . Both of these ﬁndings are important because recent reviews have shown that empirical tests of the effects derived from theories of market structure are extremely fragile ( Cohen and Levin 1989 ) . Future research could further demonstrate the value of differ - ent dimensions of the technology regime by showing that they are less sensitive than the market structure framework to the speciﬁcation of the sample and the mode of analysis . The results of this study provide only a small step toward understanding the effects of technology regime characteristics on ﬁrm formation . While the results shown here demonstrate that several attributes of the technology regime increase the likelihood that new ﬁrm formation will be selected as a mode of technology exploitation , data limitations preclude the examination of whether these factors also inﬂuence the rate of technology exploitation by incumbent ﬁrms . Because incumbent ﬁrms could also respond positively to these factors , perhaps even to a greater degree than new ﬁrms , the results shown here cannot determine whether ﬁrm formation rates are greater in technological regimes of creative destruction than in technological regimes of creative accumulation . Rather , the results are equally consistent with the proposition that new ﬁrm formation is more com - mon under regimes of creative accumulation , as well as the idea that no distinct regime exists at all . Future research is necessary to examine the differen - tial impact of technological regimes on the heteroge - neous populations of ﬁrms . Moreover , while the study provides evidence of the tendency of entrepreneurs to exploit new tech - nology through ﬁrm formation , it says nothing about the performance of those entrepreneurs . Character - istics of technology regimes may also explain why industries vary in the rate at which new ﬁrms replace established ﬁrms , the rate at which established ﬁrms acquire new ﬁrms ( Gans and Stern 1998 ) , or the rate at which new ﬁrms grow ( Acs and Audretsch 1990 ) . Future research could extend the technology regimes framework to explore whether new ﬁrms formed to exploit new technology experience different rates of failure , acquisition , and growth when they are in regimes of creative destruction or creative accumu - lation . In particular , future research could explore which of the speciﬁc dimensions of technological regime described here have the largest effects on these rates . Combined with the results of this paper , such research would provide information on how the nature of the technology regime inﬂuences the pro - cess of creative destruction through effects on rates of ﬁrm formation , rates of ﬁrm failure , rates of acquisi - tion , and rates of growth . The results presented here are important to sev - eral strands of scholarly research . They are important to entrepreneurship research because they identify an oft - overlooked category of factors that inﬂuence ﬁrm formation . One strand of entrepreneurship research has shown that several attributes of the entrepreneur inﬂuence the tendency of ﬁrms to be founded to exploit inventions ( Roberts 1991 ) . Another school of research has shown that the market structure of an industry inﬂuences the entry decision of a poten - tial entrepreneur ( Audretsch 1995 ) . A third category of research has shown that the attributes of the speciﬁc piece of technology inﬂuence the tendency of a new ﬁrm to be formed to commercialize the invention ( Christiansen and Bower 1996 ) . This study provides evidence of a fourth category of factors that entrepreneurship researchers need to consider in explaining ﬁrm formation : the nature of the technol - ogy regime . The results also provide useful implications for research in the ﬁeld of strategic management . Estab - lished ﬁrms sometimes face important challenges from new ﬁrms formed to exploit new technology . This study provides evidence that several characteris - tics of the technology regime inﬂuence the tendency for entrepreneurs to challenge existing ﬁrms . Tech - nology regimes conducive to new ﬁrm formation are also ones in which managers of existing ﬁrms must pay attention to the threat of competition from ﬁrms not yet in existence . Strategic management does not yet provide a good explanation for how ﬁrms suc - cessfully manage this threat . The results of this study suggest that the technological regime framework pro - vides a useful tool for strategic management scholars interested in identifying the conditions under which new ﬁrms are likely to emerge as competitors of established companies . Management Science / Vol . 47 , No . 9 , September 2001 1187 SHANE Technology Regimes and New Firm Formation Normative Implications The activities adopted by entrepreneurs to exploit new technologies cannot be isolated from the char - acteristics of the industries in which they operate . Although entrepreneurs may not understand , or even recognize , the industry characteristics that constrain the approaches available to them , some strategies for technology exploitation are more common in certain industries than in others . The results of this study show that the exploitation of technology through ﬁrm formation varies across industries as a func - tion of four dimensions of the technology regime . Entrepreneurs can use this information to determine if ﬁrm formation is the appropriate organizational arrangement to exploit technological opportunities in their line of business . The results of this study also have several implica - tions for public policy . In particular , the study sug - gests intellectual property policy should be assessed at the industry level . Klevorick et al . ( 1995 ) explained that intellectual property policies that are beneﬁcial to entrepreneurial activity in one industry might be detrimental in another industry . This study showed that variation in the effectiveness of intellectual prop - erty inﬂuences ﬁrm formation rates . By demon - strating that ﬁrm formation is more likely under some appropriability conditions than under oth - ers , this study suggests that intellectual property policies that are supportive of entrepreneurship in one industry may be hostile to entrepreneurship in another . The results also suggest that government poli - cies toward monopoly should be examined at the industry level . The rate at which new ﬁrms enter an industry inﬂuences the degree of competition in that industry ( Caves 1998 ) . If the characteristics of the technology regime inﬂuence the likelihood that entrepreneurs will form ﬁrms to exploit new tech - nologies , then industries have differential tendency toward monopoly . Consequently , government policy toward monopoly should take into consideration the nature of the technology regime and its implications for ﬁrm formation . Finally , the results suggest that government policy toward income distribution will be inﬂuenced by the technology regime . If entrepreneurs are differentially likely to start ﬁrms under certain technological regime conditions than under others , then the distribution of wealth generated by technological change will be dif - ferent across industries . In industries in which ﬁrm formation is more common , the wealth generated by new technology will be distributed to independent entrepreneurs and their investors . This argument sug - gests that government policies toward wealth distri - bution need to consider the nature of technological change across industries . Conclusion This paper showed that four dimensions of the tech - nology regime—the age of the technical ﬁeld , the tendency of the market toward segmentation , the effectiveness of patents , and the importance of com - plementary assets in marketing and distribution— inﬂuence the tendency for inventions to be exploited through the formation of new ﬁrms . The results generate important implications for theories about entrepreneurship . It is hoped that future researchers will consider the inﬂuence of the technological regime on new ﬁrm formation in their efforts to develop robust explanations for this important phenomenon .
