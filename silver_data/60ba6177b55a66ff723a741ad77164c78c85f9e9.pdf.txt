Our laboratory 16 and others have previously described differential innate immune stimulation elicited by 17 various Ad serotypes . Here we show that Ad5 traffics rapidly to the nucleus following 18 infection , whereas Ad35 and Ad26 accumulate in late endosomes between 2 - 8 hours 19 post - infection . Innate immune cytokine elicitation by all Ad serotypes was abrogated by 20 blockade of endosomal acidification , Cathepsin B and Caspase - 1 , suggesting that virus 21 interactions with acid - dependent sensors such as Toll - like receptor - and cathepsin - 22 dependent inflammasome activation in late endosomes may trigger innate immunity . 23 These data suggest a mechanism by which Ad vectors from various serotypes 24 differentially trigger innate antiviral pathways via distinct intracellular trafficking to late 25 endosomes . 26 27 on D e c e m be r 26 , 2017 b y gue s t h tt p : / / j v i . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m IMPORTANCE 28 Adenoviruses ( Ad ) are widely used for applications of vaccination and gene therapy . 29 Importantly , Ad vectors have been shown to differ significantly in their innate immune profiles 30 both in vivo and in vitro . The molecular mechanism which underlies these observed differences 31 has important implications for the development of improved vaccines . In this study , we propose 32 a mechanism in which the degree of late endosomal trafficking of Ad vectors results in 33 differential stimulation of late endosomal pattern recognition receptors . 34 on D e c e m be r 26 , 2017 b y gue s t h tt p : / / j v i . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m INTRODUCTION 35 Given the limitations that have become evident with adenovirus serotype 5 ( Ad5 ) 36 vectors , alternative serotype Ad vectors have been developed from serotypes against which 37 high - level humoral responses are less common in the global population , including Ad35 and 38 Ad26 ( 1 – 3 ) . Interestingly , in addition to circumventing high levels of Ad5 neutralizing antibodies , 39 alternative serotype Ad vectors differ substantially from Ad5 in the phenotypes of innate and 40 adaptive immune responses elicited by vaccination ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) . Moreover , several alternative 41 serotype Ad vector - based vaccines confer increased protection relative to Ad5 against 42 pathogenic SIVmac251 challenges in rhesus monkeys ( 4 , 6 , 7 ) . 43 Innate immune stimulation is a critical determinant for establishing the magnitude and 44 phenotype of adaptive immune responses ( 8 – 11 ) . Previously , our group and others have shown 45 that Ad vectors differ markedly in their innate immune stimulatory properties ( 12 , 13 ) . In 46 particular , Ad35 and Ad26 induce significantly higher levels of antiviral and proinflammatory 47 cytokines and chemokines in serum from vaccinated rhesus monkeys and in fresh human 48 PBMC as compared with Ad5 ( 12 ) . However , the mechanism underlying these observed 49 differences has not previously been determined . 50 Results from several groups have suggested that Toll - like receptor 9 ( TLR9 ) , late 51 endosomal lysis , and / or differences in tropism may contribute to innate stimulation by Ad 52 vectors ( 14 – 17 ) . Previous reports utilizing a variety of cell systems have also shown that Ad 53 vectors can utilize different endosomal trafficking pathways such as clathrin - mediated 54 endocytosis or macropinocytosis , and they may exit either early or late endosomes ( 18 – 24 ) . We 55 therefore hypothesized that differential Ad vector trafficking and access to late endosomal 56 pattern recognition receptors ( PRR ) might account for the differential innate stimulation elicited 57 by these vectors . 58 In this study , we show that Ad35 and Ad26 accumulate in the late endosomal 59 compartment more extensively than Ad5 at 2 - 8 hours following infection . Innate immune 60 on D e c e m be r 26 , 2017 b y gue s t h tt p : / / j v i . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m stimulation by all Ad vectors was sensitive to inhibitors of endosomal acidification , Cathepsin B , 61 and Caspase - 1 . Thus , whereas Ad vectors stimulate common innate immune sensing pathways 62 in the late endosome , marked differences in intracellular trafficking and access to this late 63 endosomal compartment may account for the different innate immune phenotypes elicited by 64 these Ad vectors . 65 66 on D e c e m be r 26 , 2017 b y gue s t h tt p : / / j v i . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m MATERIALS AND METHODS 67 Viruses . E1 / E3 - deleted replication incompetent Ad5 , Ad35 , Ad26 , Ad35k5 , and Ad5f35 vectors 68 expressing no transgene and eGFP were generated as previously described ( 25 ) ( 1 ) . Briefly , 69 viruses were produced in E1 - complimenting PER . 55K cells and purified by CsCl gradient 70 ultracentrifugation . 71 Cells . A549 cells ( ATCC ) were serially passaged in Dulbecco’s Eagle’s Modified Medium 72 supplemented with 10 % Fetal Calf Serum ( FCS ) and grown at 37°C , 5 % CO 2 . Normal human 73 blood was collected in the presence of sodium heparin and PBMC isolated by the Ficoll - 74 hypaque density gradient method ( 26 ) . Cells were resuspended at a concentration of 1x10 6 75 cells / mL in R10 medium ( RPMI , 10 % Fetal Calf Serum ( FCS ) , 50U / mL penicillin , 50μg / mL 76 streptomycin ) and further utilized in in vitro assays . 77 Chemicals . The endosomal inhibitor Bafilomycin A1 ( Enzo Life Sciences , Farmingdale , NY ) , 78 Cathepsin inhibitors Ca074 - Me , CAA0225 , Cathepsin G Inhibitor ( Millipore , Billerica , MA ) , and 79 Z - FA ( R & D Systems , Minneapolis , MN ) , and the Caspase inhibitors Z - LEHD , Z - WEHD , Z - 80 YVAD , and Z - VAD ( R & D Systems , Minneapolis , MN ) were dissolved in sterile DMSO . 81 Endosomal acidification inhibitors Chloroquine ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) , and Ammonium 82 chloride ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) were reconstituted in sterile deionized water . 83 Concentrations of inhibitors utilized were determined from prior literature or by titration for 84 function and cellular viability . 85 In Vitro Stimulation Assay . For all reactions 1x10 6 PBMC were stimulated with 1 , 000 vp / cell of 86 the indicated Ad vectors . Cells were treated with various chemical inhibitors prior to or following 87 stimulation with Ad vectors . Cells were cultured at 37°C , 10 % CO 2 , and culture supernatants 88 were harvested 24 following Ad vector stimulation by centrifugation at 1 , 400 rpm for 5 minutes . 89 Supernatants were analyzed using the Millipore Milliplex MAP Magnetic Human 90 Cytokine / Chemokine Panel ( Millipore , Billerica , MA ) according to manufacturer’s protocol . 91 Luminex data were acquired on a BioPlex 200 instrument running BioPlex Manager v4 . 1 ( Bio - 92 on D e c e m be r 26 , 2017 b y gue s t h tt p : / / j v i . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m Rad , Hercules , CA ) with an 80 % to 120 % standard acceptance range . Data were analyzed 93 using GraphPad Prism v5 . 0 . Means were compared between groups using Kruskal - Wallis Tests 94 and plotted as means and standard error of the mean ( S . E . M . ) . 95 Fluorescent Labeling of Adenoviral Vectors . Adenoviral vectors were fluorescently labeled 96 with the NHS - ester of Atto633 ( Atto - tec GmbH , Siegen , Germany ) as previously described ( 20 ) . 97 Briefly , Ad vectors were incubated for 10 - 20 minutes at RT with Atto633 and washed 3x at 4°C 98 with ice - cold PBS containing 5 % Sucrose ( w / v ) by centrifugation at 3 , 000 rpm for 30 min in 99 Amicon 10 , 000kDa molecular weight centrifuge concentration vials ( Millipore , Billerica , MA ) . 100 Atto633 : Capsomere ratio was determined using the extinction coefficient of Atto633 and Abs 260 . 101 All preparations had ratios between 0 . 5 and 1 . 8 and displayed no defect in cellular binding or 102 trafficking . 103 Infection of A549 Cells with Atto633 - Labeled Ad Vectors . 15 , 000 A549 cells were plated 104 onto No . 1 German Glass 15mm Coverslips ( BD Biosciences , San Jose , CA ) and incubated O / N 105 at 37°C , 5 % CO 2 . Cells were placed on ice , washed 2x with ice - cold Phosphate Buffered Saline 106 ( PBS ) , and overlaid with 5 , 000 - 50 , 000 vp / cell of indicated Atto633 - labeled Ad vectors diluted in 107 unsupplemented DMEM . Cells were incubated on ice with Ad vector for 90 min , with gentle 108 rocking every 15 min . Cells were washed 2x with ice - cold PBS and viral infection induced with 109 overlay of 37°C pre - warmed DMEM supplemented with 10 % FCS . Cells were cultured at 37°C , 110 10 % CO 2 . At indicated timepoints , cells were fixed by immersion into ice - cold 4 % 111 Paraformaldehyde diluted in PBS for 10 min . Cells were washed 2x with ice - cold PBS and 112 permeabilized by immersion in 0 . 01 % Saponin diluted in PBS supplemented with 5 % FCS for 113 15min . Cells were washed 3x in ice - cold PBS and stored for further use . 114 Immunofluorescence Histochemistry . Cells were stained by overlay onto a drop of the 115 indicated antibodies at the indicated concentrations diluted in PBS supplemented with 5 % FCS 116 in a humidified chamber protected from light . Primary antibodies were incubated for 1 hour and 117 secondary antibodies were incubated for 30 min . All staining steps were followed by 3x washes 118 on D e c e m be r 26 , 2017 b y gue s t h tt p : / / j v i . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m with 1 mL ice - cold PBS supplemented with 5 % FCS . Antibodies and concentrations used were 119 Rabbit anti - LAMP1 ( 1 : 1000 ) ( Abcam , Cambridge , MA ) , Mouse anti - EEA1 ( 1 : 500 ) ( BD 120 Biosciences , San Jose , CA ) , Mouse anti M6P ( 1 : 100 ) ( Abcam , Cambridge , MA ) , Goat anti - 121 Mouse IgG ( 2μg / mL ) , and Donkey anti - Rabbit IgG ( 2μg / mL ) ( Life Technologies , Grand Island , 122 NY ) . Following staining , coverslips were inverted onto a drop of ProLong Gold containing DAPI 123 mounting medium ( Life Technologies , Grand Island , NY ) on microscope slides , were allowed to 124 cure overnight at room temperature , and were stored at - 20°C for future use . 125 Confocal Microscopy . Slides were analyzed at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center 126 Imaging Core on a Zeiss LSM Meta with a 10x optical magnification and a Zeiss 63x oil - 127 immersion lens . Images were acquired using Zeiss LSM 510 ( Carl Zeiss GmbH , Jena , Germany ) 128 in the Z - stack setting with optical slices taken at a width of 0 . 5μm and an interval of 0 . 3μm . For 129 each virus , timepoint , and endosomal marker , at least 3x coverage of 2 - 7 independent 130 experiments were performed . 131 Image Processing and Analysis . Images were processed utilizing Volocity Software ( Perkin - 132 Elmer , Waltham , MA ) . Virions were detected as particles of intensity > 3x standard deviation of 133 image at least 0 . 078 μm 3 . Endosomal compartments were measured as positive by signal > 3x 134 standard deviation of image . Cells were drawn manually as Regions of Interest ( ROI ) and virion 135 colocalization within ROI’s was measured by Manzel correlation coefficient of 0 . 5 or greater . 136 Virion colocalization with a given compartment was calculated on a per ROI basis as a 137 percentage of total individual ROI virions . Image figures were generated using Fiji package for 138 ImageJ . All images for a given endosomal marker or virus were adjusted identically for 139 brightness and contrast for the purpose of image printing , and images utilized for Volocity 140 analysis were unaltered prior to analysis . Colocalization of viruses with a given compartment 141 was analyzed by GraphPad Prism 5 . 0 ( GraphPad Software , Inc . , La Jolla , CA ) , and differences 142 in colocalization between viruses was assessed by Student’s t tests . 143 on D e c e m be r 26 , 2017 b y gue s t h tt p : / / j v i . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m Data Analysis and Statistics . Cytokine and chemokine levels were assessed from Luminex 144 assays as determined using a 5 - parameter logistic model . Levels of cytokines and chemokines 145 for inhibitor treated and untreated cells was assessed by Kruskal - Wallis tests . Colocalized 146 virions / cell was calculated for each endosomal marker and virus analyzed and colocalization 147 amounts were compared between viruses by Student’s t tests . 148 149 on D e c e m be r 26 , 2017 b y gue s t h tt p : / / j v i . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m RESULTS 150 Ad35 and Ad26 accumulate to higher levels than Ad5 in the late endosomal 151 compartment at 2 - 8 hours following infection . To assess the intracellular trafficking 152 pathways for Ad5 , Ad35 , and Ad26 , vectors were covalently labeled with the NHS - ester of 153 Atto633 and tested for viability as previously described ( 20 ) . Briefly , A549 cells were infected 154 with an MOI of 5 , 000 - 50 , 000 viral particles ( vp ) / cell of fluorescently - labeled Ad vector , and 155 colocalization was measured over time by confocal microscopy for the early endosome marker 156 Early Endosome Antigen 1 ( EEA1 ) or the late endosomal markers Lysosomal - Associated 157 Membrane Protein 1 ( LAMP1 ) or Mannose - 6 - Phosphate Receptor ( M6P ) by 158 immunofluorescence histochemistry , and nuclei were labeled by DAPI ( 27 – 29 ) . Viruses were 159 measured for colocalization in a given endosomal / nuclear compartment by calculation of Manzel 160 correlation coefficient , and differences between vector localization at a given time point were 161 determined by Student’s t tests . 162 Ad5 virions rapidly accumulated in the peri - nuclear region , with 72 . 6 % of virions 163 colocalizing with nuclear staining by 2 h post - infection ( Figure 1A , 1B ) . Colocalization of Ad5 164 with the early endosomal marker EEA1 occurred only minimally and never exceeded 7 % at any 165 timepoint measured ( Figure 1A ) . Ad5 virions also localized to minor levels with late endosomes , 166 as indicated by low levels of colocalization with LAMP1 or M6P at 2 h post infection ( 4 . 0 % and 167 2 . 7 % colocalization , respectively ) ( Figure 1A , 1B ) . These results indicate that Ad5 rapidly 168 trafficked to the nucleus and only minimally accumulated in early and late endosomal 169 compartments . 170 Ad35 and Ad26 exhibited marked differences in intracellular trafficking pathways as 171 compared with Ad5 . Ad35 and Ad26 displayed substantial but transient colocalization with the 172 early endosomal marker EEA1 at 30 min ( 18 . 5 % and 45 . 5 % colocalization , respectively ) and at 173 1 h ( 11 . 9 % and 19 . 9 % colocalization , respectively ) post infection ( Figure 1A ) . The colocalization 174 of Ad35 and Ad26 with early endosomes was greater than that observed for Ad5 at both 30 min 175 on D e c e m be r 26 , 2017 b y gue s t h tt p : / / j v i . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m ( 3 . 2x and 7 . 8x fold greater colocalization , respectively ; p = 0 . 0001 , p < 0 . 0001 , respectively ; 176 Student’s t tests ) and at 60 min ( 2 . 8x and 4 . 6x fold greater colocalization , respectively ; 177 p = 0 . 0082 , p = 0 . 0048 , respectively ) . At later time points , both Ad35 and Ad26 demonstrated 178 substantial colocalization with the late endosomal marker LAMP1 , with 12 . 6 % and 25 . 7 % of 179 virions colocalizing with late endosomes at 2 h post - infection , respectively ( Figure 1A , 1B ) . Ad35 180 and Ad26 also colocalized with the late endosomal marker M6P at 2 h post - infection ( 15 . 4 % and 181 26 . 2 % of virions , respectively ) ( Figure 1A , 1B ) . Analysis of adherent PBMC , which include 182 multiple cellular subsets ( 30 ) , showed that Ad35 and Ad26 similarly colocalized with late 183 endosomes by 2h post - infection ( data not shown ) . Both Ad35 and Ad26 accumulated in the late 184 endosomal compartment to significantly higher levels than Ad5 at 2 h post infection as 185 measured by both LAMP1 ( 3 . 1x and 6 . 4x fold greater colocalization , respectively ; p = 0 . 0088 , 186 p = 0 . 0001 , respectively ) and M6P ( 5 . 8x and 9 . 8x fold greater colocalization , respectively ; 187 p < 0 . 0001 , both ) colocalization . This association of Ad35 and Ad26 in the late endosomes 188 persisted for all time points observed between 2 - 8 h post - infection . Taken together , these 189 results indicate that Ad35 and Ad26 display a markedly different intracellular trafficking pattern 190 as compared with Ad5 , characterized by substantially greater association with late endosomes 191 2 - 8 hours post - infection . 192 193 Ad Innate immune stimulation is blocked by inhibitors of late endosomal acidification . 194 Ad35 and Ad26 induce markedly higher levels of antiviral and proinflammatory cytokines and 195 chemokines , including IFN - α , IFN - γ , IP - 10 , IL - 6 , and IL - 1RA , than Ad5 in serum from vaccinated 196 rhesus monkeys and in human PBMC ( 12 ) . Interestingly , these differences in innate immune 197 cytokines and chemokines corresponded with the observed levels of Ad vector trafficking to the 198 late endosome . To probe the possible late endosomal innate sensing pathways the different Ad 199 vectors may activate , we assessed the dependence of innate triggering by these vectors to late 200 endosomal acidification . Fresh human PBMC ( n = 4 / group ) were isolated and pre - incubated with 201 on D e c e m be r 26 , 2017 b y gue s t h tt p : / / j v i . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m the endosomal acidification inhibitors Bafilomycin A1 ( BafA ) , chloroquine , or ammonium chloride 202 for 1 h prior to infection with 1 , 000 vp / cell of Ad5 , Ad35 , or Ad26 ( 31 , 32 ) . Cytokine induction 203 was measured 24 h following infection by Luminex assays as previously described ( 12 ) . 204 Pre - incubation of human PBMC with BafA , chloroquine , or ammonium chloride markedly 205 decreased induction of innate cytokines and chemokines by all the Ad vectors studied ( Figure 206 2 ) . This inhibition was most pronounced for IFN - α2 with pre - incubation of PBMC with BafA , 207 chloroquine , or ammonium chloride , leading to reduced levels of IFNα2 upon stimulation with 208 Ad5 , Ad35 , or Ad26 ( Figure 2 ) . Activity of inhibitors on intracellular innate immune signaling was 209 confirmed by the inhibition of intracellular Poly I : C sensing but not extracellular LPS sensing by 210 all three endosomal acidification inhibitors . Together , these data suggest that innate stimulation 211 by all three vectors was sensitive to inhibitors of late endosomal acidification . 212 213 Innate immune stimulation by Ad5 , Ad35 , and Ad26 is sensitive to Cathepsin B , 214 Cathepsin L , and pan - Cathepsin inhibition . We next evaluated the role of specific cathepsins 215 in Ad innate sensing . Cathepsins are a group of late endosomal papain - like proteases which 216 serve several important roles in late endosomal cargo processing as well as autophagy and 217 apoptosis ( 33 ) . Fresh human PBMC ( n = 4 / group ) were pre - incubated for 1h with the Cathepsin 218 B inhibitor Ca074 - Me , Cathepsin L inhibitor CAA0225 , a Cathepsin G inhibitor , the pan - Caspase 219 inhibitor Z - VAD , the pan - Cathepsin inhibitor Z - FA , or a DMSO vehicle control . Cells were then 220 stimulated with 1 , 000 vp / cell of Ad5 , Ad35 , or Ad26 . Elicited cytokine and chemokine levels 221 were analyzed 24 h post - infection by Luminex assays as described above . 222 Human PBMC pre - incubated with Ca074 - Me , CAA0225 , or Z - FA exhibited reduced 223 levels of multiple cytokines and chemokines produced in response to Ad vectors . In particular , 224 levels of IFN - α2 , IFN - γ , MIP - 1β , and TNF - α were significantly reduced following pre - incubation 225 of human PBMC with these cathepsin inhibitors in response to Ad35 and Ad26 relative to 226 DMSO vehicle control , and similar trends were observed for Ad5 ( Figure 3 ) . Pre - incubation with 227 on D e c e m be r 26 , 2017 b y gue s t h tt p : / / j v i . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m a Cathepsin G inhibitor , however , had minor effects on cytokines and chemokines elicited by 228 Ad35 and Ad26 ( Figure 3 ) . These results suggest that Ad35 and Ad26 , and to a lesser extent 229 Ad5 , are inhibited by Cathepsin B and pan - Cathepsin inhibition , suggesting the functional 230 relevance of late endosomal localization to triggering innate immunity . 231 232 Inhibition of Caspase - 1 reduces innate immune stimulation elicited by Ad5 , Ad35 , and 233 Ad26 . Caspases are proteases that serve as major components of pro - apoptotic and pro - 234 inflammatory pathways ( 34 ) . To assess the role of caspases in Ad innate stimulation , fresh 235 human PBMC ( n = 3 - 4 / group ) were stimulated with Ad5 , Ad35 , or Ad26 following pre - incubation 236 for 1 h with the Caspase - 9 inhibitor Z - LEHD , the Caspase - 1 inhibitor Z - WEHD , the Caspase - 4 237 inhibitor Z - YVAD , or DMSO vehicle control . Pre - incubation of human PBMC with Z - WEHD led to 238 a marked reduction of IFN - α2 and IFN - γ elicited by Ad35 and Ad26 ( Figure 4 ) . In contrast , pre - 239 incubation of human PBMC with the Caspase - 9 inhibitor Z - LEHD or the Caspase - 4 inhibitor Z - 240 YVAD had little to no effect on the innate cytokine stimulation by Ad5 , Ad35 , and Ad26 . Similar 241 to experiments performed with Cathepsin inhibitors , overall levels of cytokines and chemokines 242 elicited by Ad5 were lower than Ad35 and Ad26 , yet remained sensitive to Z - WEHD inhibition . 243 These data suggest a role for Caspase - 1 in the induction of immune responses by these Ad 244 vectors . 245 246 Innate stimulation by Ad5 , Ad35 , and Ad26 is initiated between 0 - 6 hours post infection . 247 To determine the timing of the initial triggering of the innate sensing pathways by Ad vectors , 248 fresh human PBMC were stimulated with 1 , 000 vp / cell of Ad5 , Ad35 , or Ad26 . At 0 , 4 , 6 , 8 , or 249 12 h post - infection , cells were treated with chloroquine , ammonium chloride , Ca074 - Me , 250 CAA0225 , or Z - FA at the concentrations described above . Cytokine and chemokine levels were 251 assessed 24 h following infection by Luminex assays and compared to infected cells with mock 252 inhibition . 253 on D e c e m be r 26 , 2017 b y gue s t h tt p : / / j v i . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m Addition of inhibitors at the time of infection ( 0 h ) effectively inhibited induction of IFN - α2 , 254 IFN - γ , and TNF - α ( Figure 5 ) , in agreement with the previous experiments ( Figures 2 - 4 ) . For all 255 three vectors , the majority of inhibition of innate sensing by chloroquine and Z - FA occurred 256 earlier than 6 h post - infection , with the most prominent inhibition caused by Z - FA occurring up to 257 12 h post - infection ( Figure 5 ) . Interestingly , inhibition of cytokine responses elicited by Ad26 , 258 and to a lesser extent by Ad5 , was sensitive to inhibition up to 6 h post infection , while those 259 elicited in response to Ad35 were able to be significantly inhibited up to 4 h post infection . Taken 260 together , these data indicate that innate immune sensing of Ad5 , Ad35 , and Ad26 was initiated 261 between 0 - 6 h post - infection . These findings are consistent with the possibility that localization 262 of Ad vectors to the late endosome is important for Ad innate sensing , as inhibition of innate 263 immune sensors reduced Ad innate immune stimulation during times at which Ad vectors were 264 observed to be present in late endosomes . 265 266 Chemical inhibition of innate immune stimulation does not perturb transduction 267 efficiency . We next investigated whether chemical inhibition of Ad innate immune stimulation 268 was simply due to blockade of Ad infectivity . To test whether chemical inhibitors had an effect 269 on Ad35 or Ad26 transduction efficiency , human PBMC ( n = 4 / group ) were treated at the time of 270 infection with chloroquine , ammonium chloride , Ca074Me , CAA0225 , Z - FA , or DMSO vehicle 271 control as described above . These cells were then stimulated with 1 , 000 vp / cell of Ad35 or Ad26 272 expressing eGFP . Levels of elicited cytokines and chemokines were measured 24 h post 273 infection by Luminex assays , and levels of transduced cells were measured by flow cytometry . 274 Similar to our results above , chloroquine , ammonium chloride , Ca074 - Me , CAA0225 , 275 and Z - FA reduced cytokine and chemokine induction in human PBMC elicited by Ad35 or Ad26 276 expressing eGFP at 24 h post infection ( data not shown ) . Flow cytometry on stimulated cells 277 showed no inhibition of transduction of PBMC by either Ad35 or Ad26 for any of the chemical 278 inhibitors analyzed , as measured by % eGFP positive cells 24 h post - infection ( Figure 6 ) . These 279 on D e c e m be r 26 , 2017 b y gue s t h tt p : / / j v i . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m results show that chemical inhibition of Ad35 and Ad26 innate sensing did not substantially 280 reduce vector infectivity . 281 282 Both Ad fiber and capsid components influence intracellular trafficking pathways . Both 283 fiber and capsid components of Ad5 and Ad35 can influence innate stimulatory properties of Ad 284 vectors ( 12 ) . In particular , both Ad35 fiber and capsid components were required to confer the 285 increased innate stimulatory properties of Ad35 relative to Ad5 . We sought to determine the 286 influence of Ad fiber and capsid components on access to the late endosomal compartment and 287 the associated Ad innate sensing mechanisms . To explore the influence of the Ad fiber and 288 capsid on Ad intracellular trafficking , we utilized Ad35k5 , a chimeric Ad35 with its fiber knob 289 domain replaced with that of Ad5 , and Ad5f35 , a chimeric Ad5 with its fiber protein replaced with 290 that of Ad35 . A549 cells were infected with Ad35k5 and Ad5f35 vectors and subsequently 291 processed for immunofluorescence histochemistry and confocal microscopy as described in 292 Figure 1 . 293 Ad5f35 and Ad35k5 both displayed an initial colocalization with the EEA1 compartment 294 at 30 min ( 32 . 9 % and 20 . 2 % , respectively ) and 60 min ( 21 . 4 % and 22 . 4 % , respectively ) , similar 295 to that observed with Ad35 . Furthermore , both Ad5f35 and Ad35k5 displayed increased late 296 endosomal trafficking beginning at 2 h post infection , as indicated by higher colocalization 297 relative to Ad5 at 2 h for both LAMP1 ( 2 . 8x and 5 . 9x fold greater colocalization relative to Ad5 , 298 respectively ; p = 0 . 0215 and p < 0 . 0001 , respectively ; Students’ t tests ) and M6P ( 5 . 6x and 8 . 8x 299 higher colocalization , respectively ; p = 0 . 0003 and p < 0 . 0001 , respectively ) ( Figure 7 ) . These data 300 indicate that both fiber and capsid components of Ad vectors influence intracellular trafficking 301 patterns , and suggest increased late endosomal association as a mechanism for the previously 302 observed increase in innate cytokine and chemokine stimulation by both Ad5f35 and Ad35k5 303 relative to Ad5 ( 12 ) . 304 305 on D e c e m be r 26 , 2017 b y gue s t h tt p : / / j v i . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m DISCUSSION 306 In this study , we show that Ad5 , Ad35 , and Ad26 differ substantially in their intracellular 307 trafficking patterns , with Ad35 and Ad26 accumulating to a greater degree than Ad5 in late 308 endosomes , and Ad5 rapidly trafficking to the nucleus . All three vectors were sensitive to 309 chemical inhibitors of late endosomal innate immune sensing , in particular endosomal 310 acidification , cathepsin B , and caspase - 1 . These studies suggest a mechanism that could 311 account for the differential innate immune stimulatory phenotypes of Ad vectors in which 312 intracellular trafficking to the late endosome contributes to these observed differences in innate 313 immunity ( 12 , 13 ) ( Figure 8 ) . In the late endosome , virions stimulate stereotypical innate 314 immune pathways that require endosomal acidification , cathepsins , and caspase - 1 ( Figure 8 ) . 315 Taken together , these data suggest that intracellular Ad vector trafficking critically influences 316 innate immune stimulation by various Ad serotypes . 317 Innate immune stimulation elicited in response to all three Ad vectors was sensitive to 318 inhibition of acidification , cathepsins , and caspase - 1 , suggesting that accumulation in late 319 endosomes , rather than differential Pattern Recognition Receptor ( PRR ) stimulation per se , may 320 be responsible for the observed differences in innate immune phenotypes elicited by these 321 vectors . The requirement of endosomal acidification for innate sensing suggests that late 322 endosomal TLRs may be the endosomal acidification - dependent portion of the sensing pathway 323 ( Figures 2 , 8 ) . For example , TLR9 has been previously implicated in Ad vector dsDNA genome 324 sensing , and TLR9 requires endosomal acidification for its function ( 14 , 35 – 38 ) . Additionally , 325 late endosomal lysis and Cathepsin B release into the cytosol activates the NALP3 326 inflammasome , and Cathepsin B activity is required for this process ( 39 ) . The sensitivity of Ad 327 vector innate stimulation to both the Cathepsin B inhibitor Ca074 - Me as well as the pan - 328 Cathepsin inhibitor Z - FA for an extended period following Ad endocytosis temporally is 329 consistent with our observation that Ad35 and Ad26 vectors potentially begin exiting the late 330 endosome at 2 - 6 hours post - infection ( Figures 1A , 5 ) . Additionally , the fact that Ad vector 331 on D e c e m be r 26 , 2017 b y gue s t h tt p : / / j v i . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m sensing was sensitive to Cathepsin inhibitors for up to 6 h following infection indicates that a 332 defect in endosomal TLR processing is unlikely to account for the reduced innate immune 333 stimulation observed . Of note , recent studies have suggested the importance of the cytosolic 334 DNA sensor cGAS for innate sensing of Ad5 in murine cells ( 40 ) . The potential influence of 335 cGAS on Ad innate immune sensing as well as putative differences between Ad5 , Ad35 , and 336 Ad26 on cGAS stimulation will therefore be of interest for further understanding of Ad innate 337 immune sensing . Importantly , our data confirm prior observations of the importance of acid - 338 dependent innate immune sensors and inflammasome activation , and extend these findings by 339 suggesting that differential trafficking of several Ad serotypes currently in pre - clinical and clinical 340 development to late endosomal compartments contributes to their innate immune stimulatory 341 phenotypes . Importantly , these data also suggest , in agreement with previous studies showing 342 Ad vector innate sensing is redundant in vivo , that several pattern recognition receptors are 343 likely important for Ad vector sensing ( 13 , 16 , 41 ) . 344 Our studies utilized A549 cells and human PBMC for the analysis of Ad vector 345 trafficking , and human PBMC for the assessment of innate immune phenotypes ( 12 , 18 , 22 , 23 , 346 42 ) . A limitation of studying vector trafficking in A549 cells is that they are more homogeneous 347 than the diverse cellular subsets in PBMC . We previously showed that the innate immune 348 cytokines and chemokines elicited by Ad vectors is dependent on several PBMC subsets ( 12 ) . 349 Due to the bulk nature of the measurements of innate stimulation performed on PBMC , it is 350 possible that inhibition of particular cellular subsets may be responsible for the results observed . 351 As such , the chemical inhibitor data shown above cannot formally differentiate between 352 induction of common sensing pathways in all PBMC subsets or triggering of different innate 353 sensing pathways in different PBMC subsets . Nevertheless , our results strongly suggest that 354 important innate signaling pathways likely involve late endosomes . 355 Both the fiber as well as other capsid components appear to contribute to the innate 356 stimulatory properties of Ad vectors , suggesting roles of receptor binding proteins as well as 357 on D e c e m be r 26 , 2017 b y gue s t h tt p : / / j v i . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m acid - dependent capsid protease components in determining Ad innate immune stimulatory 358 phenotypes ( 12 ) . Interestingly CD46 - binding by the fiber protein appears to be sufficient to 359 confer late endosomal trafficking on Ad vectors ( 22 ) . These data suggest that Ad innate immune 360 stimulation phenotypes observed in previous studies may be reflective of increased late 361 endosomal trafficking conferred by the fiber rather than primary receptor usage ( 15 , 17 , 37 ) . 362 Furthermore , the increased innate stimulatory capacity of Ad5f35 relative to Ad35k5 , despite 363 their roughly equivalent ability to access late endosomal compartments , suggests an active role 364 of CD46 in influencing Ad vector innate immune stimulation , a possibility which warrants further 365 investigation . 366 In summary , our data suggest a potential mechanism by which Ad5 , Ad35 , and Ad26 367 vectors differentially stimulate innate immunity . These vectors trigger similar innate immune 368 pathways , but the extent of stimulation is driven by differential intracellular trafficking to late 369 endosomes , resulting in profound differences in innate immunity . These results have important 370 implications for the development of vaccine and gene therapy vectors and could lead to 371 strategies for rational vector design that specifically tune desired innate immune phenotypes . 372 373 374 on D e c e m be r 26 , 2017 b y gue s t h tt p : / / j v i . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 375 We thank S .

Fresh human PBMC ( n = 4 / group ) were 571 isolated as described above and stimulated with 1 , 000 vp / cell of Ad5 , Ad35 , or Ad26 . Chemical 572 inhibitors Chloroquine , Ammonium chloride , Ca074 - Me , CAA0225 , or Z - FA were added at the 573 indicated times following infection . Levels of elicited cytokines and chemokines were measured 574 24 h following infection by Luminex assays and compared to an infected , mock - inhibited control 575 ( Media ) . 576 Figure 6 . Chemical inhibition of Ad5 , Ad35 , or Ad26 innate immune signaling does not 577 block Ad transduction . Fresh human PBMC ( n = 4 / group ) were synchronously inhibited with 578 chloroquine , ammonium chloride , Ca074 - Me , CAA0225 , Z - FA , or DMSO vehicle control at same 579 on D e c e m be r 26 , 2017 b y gue s t h tt p : / / j v i . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m concentrations as above , and stimulated with 1 , 000 vp / cell of Ad35 or Ad26 expressing eGFP . 580 24 h following infection percent eGFP cellular transduction was measured by flow cytometry . 581 Figure 7 . Both fiber and capsid components influence Ad vector intracellular trafficking 582 patterns . A549 cells were incubated with 50 , 000 vp / cell of Atto - 633 labeled Ad35k5 or Ad5f35 583 and fixed at indicated times post infection by immersion in 4 % paraformaldehyde . Cells were 584 stained for the indicated markers by immunohistochemistry and virion colocalization assessed 585 as described above . Graphs indicate virions / cell colocalized with the indicated compartment at 586 indicated timepoints with Ad5 and Ad35 data from Figure 1 shown as dashed lines for 587 reference . Symbols indicate timepoints where both Ad35k5 and Ad5f35 colocalization values 588 were both significantly different than Ad5 , with the less significant value indicated ( * p < 0 . 01 , 589 + p < 0 . 001 ; Student’s t tests ) . 590 Figure 8 . Proposed model of differential innate immune stimulation elicited by Ad5 , Ad35 , 591 and Ad26 . Ad5 , Ad35 , and Ad26 virions enter the cell through an EEA - positive early endosomal 592 compartment . Upon entry to this location , the majority of Ad5 rapidly exits the endocytic 593 pathway into the cytosol where it subsequently traffics to the nucleus by 60 min post - infection . 594 Ad35 and Ad26 , as well as a small subset of Ad5 virions , accumulate in the late endosomal 595 compartment 2 - 6 h following infection . At approximately 2 - 6 h post - infection , late endosomal Ad 596 virions exit the late endosome and traffic to the nucleus . Accumulation of Ad virions in late 597 endosomes and their release into the cytosol stimulates both an endosomal acidification - 598 dependent as well as a cathepsin - dependent sensor . 599 on D e c e m be r 26 , 2017 b y gue s t h tt p : / / j v i . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m A Figure 1A on D e c e m be r 26 , 2017 b y gue s t h tt p : / / j v i . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m Nucleus LAMP1 M6P B Figure 1B Ad5 Ad35Ad35 Ad26Ad26 on D e c e m be r 26 , 2017 b y gue s t h tt p : / / j v i . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m Figure 2 on D e c e m be r 26 , 2017 b y gue s t h tt p : / / j v i . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m Figure 3 on D e c e m be r 26 , 2017 b y gue s t h tt p : / / j v i . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m Figure 4 on D e c e m be r 26 , 2017 b y gue s t h tt p : / / j v i . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m Figure 5 on D e c e m be r 26 , 2017 b y gue s t h tt p : / / j v i . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m Figure 6 on D e c e m be r 26 , 2017 b y gue s t h tt p : / / j v i . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m Figure 7 on D e c e m be r 26 , 2017 b y gue s t h tt p : / / j v i . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m Figure 8 on D e c e m be r 26 , 2017 b y gue s t h tt p : / / j v i . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m
