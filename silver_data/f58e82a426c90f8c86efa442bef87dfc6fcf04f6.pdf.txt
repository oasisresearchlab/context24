Started in 2005 , Galaxy continues to focus on three key challenges of data - driven biomedical science : making analyses accessible to all researchers , en - suring analyses are completely reproducible , and making it simple to communicate analyses so that they can be reused and extended . During the last two years , the Galaxy team and the open - source community around Galaxy have made substantial im - provements to Galaxy’s core framework , user inter - face , tools , and training materials . Framework and user interface improvements now enable Galaxy to be used for analyzing tens of thousands of datasets , and > 5500 tools are now available from the Galaxy ToolShed . The Galaxy community has led an effort to create numerous high - quality tutorials focused on common types of genomic analyses . The Galaxy de - veloper and user communities continue to grow and be integral to Galaxy’s development . The number of Galaxy public servers , developers contributing to the Galaxy framework and its tools , and users of the main Galaxy server have all increased substantially . INTRODUCTION Advances in biomedicine and biology increasingly rely on analysis of large datasets . Started in 2005 , the Galaxy Project ( https : / / galaxyproject . org ) ( 1 – 3 ) maintains a focus on enabling data - driven biomedical science by pursuing three goals : ( a ) accessible data analysis serving all scien - tists regardless of their informatics expertise and tool de - velopers seeking a wider audience and broad integration of their tools ; ( b ) reproducible analyses regardless of the par - ticular platform and ( c ) transparent communication of anal - yses , which in turn enables reuse and extension of analyses across communities of practice . The Galaxy Project consists of four complementary components : ( 1 ) The main public Galaxy server ( https : / / usegalaxy . org ) – – this server is the subject of this article and has been online since 2007 . It features a rich toolset for large - scale genomics analyses , terabytes of public data for use , and hundreds of shared analysis histories , work - flows , and interactive publication supplements . This server has more than 124 , 000 registered users whom run ∼ 245 , 000 analysis jobs each month . ( 2 ) The Galaxy framework and software ecosystem ( https : / / github . com / galaxyproject ) – – an open - source software package that anyone can use to run a Galaxy server on any Unix - based operating system .

W538 Nucleic Acids Research , 2018 , Vol . 46 , Web Server issue tem includes a software development kit ( SDK ) for Galaxy tool development , API language bindings for multiple programming languages , software for script - ing Galaxy interactions , and tools for automating setup and deployment of Galaxy and its plugins such as tools and visualizations . ( 3 ) The Galaxy ToolShed ( https : / / toolshed . g2 . bx . psu . edu / ) – – a community - driven resource for the dissemi - nation of Galaxy tools , workflows , and visualizations . This server functions as an ‘AppStore’ for Galaxy servers where developers and Galaxy admins can host , share , and install Galaxy tools , workflows and visualizations . ( 4 ) The Galaxy Community ( https : / / galaxyproject . org / community / ) – – distinct and complementary subcom - munities make key contributions to all aspects of the Project . These subcommunities address the needs and desires of every category of stakeholder including users , administrators , developers , resource providers and ed - ucators . Galaxy has served hundreds of thousands of users , been used in > 5700 scientific publications , and pro - vided 500 + developers with a framework provisioning accessible , transparent , and reproducible data analysis ( https : / / galaxyproject . org / galaxy - project / statistics / ) . Many instances of the framework have been installed , including Galaxy Main ( https : / / usegalaxy . org ) and over 99 publicly accessible servers ( https : / / galaxyproject . org / public - galaxy - servers / ) , serving biomedical and other domain - specific re - search . Significant growth has occurred across all sectors of the Galaxy Project within the past two years ( Figure 1 ) . NEW FEATURES Scalability Scalability is amongst the most significant challenges that Galaxy faces as the size and number of biomedical and es - pecially genomics datasets continues to grow . For instance , single - cell RNA - seq experiments routinely generate hun - dreds or thousands of primary datasets . As a web - based ap - plication , Galaxy must scale both in its web - based interface and on its backend server and do so in a multiuser environ - ment . User interface scalability enables scientists to use the Galaxy web interface to analyze many datasets , apply ( col - lective ) operations on them , and design pipelines to ana - lyze them . Galaxy implements a variety of features to facil - itate analyzing large numbers of datasets , including work - flows and collections . Our recent optimizations of the user interface ( UI ) yielded a significant improvement to frontend scalability . We benchmarked the optimizations by replicat - ing an experiment conducted on single Hematopoietic stem cells and multipotent progenitors ( 4 ) to quantify the expres - sion of 64 000 transcripts , which generates 11 872 history items . Galaxy ran this proof of concept experiment seam - lessly using existing standard tools , whereas earlier versions of Galaxy would not have been able to support this analysis . Server scalability refers to the Galaxy’s ability to execute many data analysis / manipulation tasks for many users . This Figure 1 . Circular barplot illustrating recent growth of the Galaxy Project across several independent facets . In the past two years , usage of the main public Galaxy server has increased 60 % , the number of tools and sup - ported versions has increased 53 % , and the amount of data analyzed on the main server has increased 72 % . A growing number of public instances ( 18 % increase ) and cloud - based Galaxy instances ( 38 % increase ) provide researcherswithawiderrangeofoptionsforscalabilityandapplicationdo - mains . Additionally , more developers ( 45 % increase with 63 % more com - mits to the codebase ) contributed to the Galaxy framework and software ecosystem . Question and answer activity on the Galaxy Biostars forum in - creased 68 % . is achieved by advantageously utilizing a range of avail - able computing resources . The Galaxy framework runs on various platforms , from a standard laptop to institutional clusters and cloud - based platforms . Galaxy is highly ver - satile in its ability to deploy jobs ( atomic units of work ) , as it can leverage a multitude of workload managers in - cluding Slurm ( 5 ) , HTCondor ( 6 ) , Apache Mesos ( 7 ) and Kubernetes ( https : / / kubernetes . io ) , among others , in addi - tion to a built - in lightweight job running system . Recent en - hancements to Galaxy’s job management include dynamic job destination assignment ( which facilitate automatic job parameter - specific resource selection ) , delay in job queuing ( e . g . for workflows ) , automatic job re - submission ( e . g . , on job failure due to a temporary cluster error ) , and means of implementing fair - share prioritization schemes . These fea - tures are being used on Galaxy Main ( Figure 2 ) to lever - age cloud computing resources for better job throughput . Specifically , Galaxy Main is now configured to take advan - tage of the XSEDE infrastructure ( 8 ) that includes Bridges and Stampede resources as well as the Jetstream cloud ( 9 ) . The benefits of using these resources include the ability to run larger jobs , as shown in Figure 3 . Additionally , use of these resources has enabled new types of analysis to be en - abled on Main . Notably , this includes Galaxy Interactive Nucleic Acids Research , 2018 , Vol . 46 , Web Server issue W539 Figure2 . SchematicofserversandservicesinuseatGalaxyMain . ( A ) AglobaloverviewofGalaxyMainresources . Whenusersinteractwithusegalaxy . org , their browser connects to one of two frontends ( shown as web - 01 / 02 ) with file uploads being handled by web - 03 / 04 ; each of these web servers connects to a database server and mounts a set of shared distributed file systems . Web - 03 / 04 also prepares and schedules jobs using Slurm directly to manage computetasks on fifteen dedicatedcompute nodes , which also directly mount the shared distributedfile systems . A combinationof Slurm and Pulsar ( https : / / github . com / galaxyproject / pulsar ) are used to manage tasks and for dataset file staging , respectively , on the Jetstream cloud at Indiana University ( IU ) and theTexasAdvancedComputingCenter ( TACC ) . CommunicationbetweenGalaxyandPulsarishandledusingtheRabbitMQ ( https : / / www . rabbitmq . com / ) message broker . Additional jobs are sent to the supercomputer systems Bridges at Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center ( PSC ) and Stampede at TACC using Pulsar . Thesevariouscomputeresourcesarechosenbasedupontoolandjobcharacteristics . See , e . g . https : / / github . com / galaxyproject / usegalaxy - playbook / wiki / Infrastructure for specific and up - to - date information . ( B ) Multiple frontend servers provide Galaxy content to users by utilizing round - robin load balancing . Nginx ( https : / / nginx . org / ) is used to serve HTTP content from the Galaxy uWSGI web application . Individual software processes are monitored and controlled using Supervisor ( http : / / supervisord . org / ) . Each of these frontend servers connects to a PostgreSQL ( https : / / www . postgresql . org / ) database server . ( C ) Layout of data schemes used by Galaxy Main is optimized for application speed , concurrent access , and versioned content . Each Galaxy frontend server utilizes a combination of shared distributed file systems , CVMFS for versioned semi - static content and TACC’s Corral filesystem via NFS for mutable content , along with server - specific local file systems . ( D ) CernVM File System ( CVMFS ) infrastructure hosted by the Galaxy Project that is used at Main and available for access to any other Galaxy instance . Stratum 0 contains the single - source modifiable data repositories . File content is served using the Apache HTTP server ( https : / / httpd . apache . org / ) . To enable redundancy and scaling to a large number of clients , Stratum 1 replica servers are hosted at multiple locations and utilize Squid ( http : / / www . squid - cache . org / ) for data caching . Additional replica servers can also be hosted by community members . Individual clients ( Galaxy instances and compute nodes ) access data content from Stratum 1 servers using a Filesystem in Userspace ( FUSE ) mount . Environments through the ability to use containerization technologies and provide sufficient isolation of individual jobs from other processes running on the same underlying compute infrastructure . A complete Galaxy server with a full repertoire of tools and reference data can be run on major cloud platforms . These servers are launched independently by users , and come pre - configured with hundreds of tools and reason - able default settings typical of a production server . Notably , launched instances do not have usage quotas and can be customized to install any desired tool . We have designed a cloud - agnostic approach for leveraging these resources by developing the abstraction library CloudBridge ( 10 ) and a new CloudLaunch application . These two solutions make it possible to launch Galaxy instances across a variety of cloud providers while reducing the requirement to build and maintain cloud - specific resources ( e . g . machine images , file systems ) . There are now 10 different flavors of Galaxy available for launching on major clouds including Ama - zon Web Services , Jetstream and Microsoft Azure ( https : / / launch . usegalaxy . org ) . Advances in tools The Galaxy ToolShed ( 11 ) assumes the role of an App - Store for Galaxy instances by hosting thousands of tools . The ToolShed improves tool availability , deployment , and portability across Galaxy servers and computing environ - ments . W540 Nucleic Acids Research , 2018 , Vol . 46 , Web Server issue Figure3 . EnablingautomatedselectionanduseofspecializednationalcyberinfrastructurecomputeresourcesfromGalaxyMainenhancesuser - experience . It is now possible to run jobs that are up to an order of magnitude larger than before by using Bridges and Stampede . New types of jobs , such as interactive environments ( see Advances in tools section ) , that require execution isolation due to security concerns are enabled by utilizing virtualization facilitated by the Jetstream cloud . Consequently , it is possible to concurrently run more jobs due to the increase in processing capacity . Updated tool suite . Over the last two years , we have ex - panded both the quantity and quality of the tools avail - able on the Galaxy ToolShed . As of April 2018 , the Tool - Shed hosts 5628 tools , which shows 53 % growth since 2016 , and ∼ 2000 repositories had at least one new update . Exam - ples of new tools include : GEMINI for exploring genetic variation ( 12 ) ; mothur for analyzing rRNA gene sequences ( 13 ) ; QIIME for quantitative microbiome analysis from raw DNA sequencing data ( 14 ) ; deepTools for explorative anal - ysis of deeply sequence data ( 15 , 16 ) ; HiCexplorer ( 17 ) for analysis and visualization of Hi - C data ; ChemicalToolBox for comprehensive access to cheminformatics libraries and drug discovery tools ( 18 ) ; minimap2 ( https : / / arxiv . org / abs / 1708 . 01492 ) and poretools for long read sequencing analy - sis ( 19 ) ; MultiQC ( 20 ) to aggregate multiple results into a single report ; a new RNA - seq analysis tool suite with mod - ern analysis tools such as Kallisto ( 21 ) , Salmon ( 22 ) , De - seq2 ( 23 ) and STAR - Fusion ( 24 ) , and GenomeSpace ( 25 ) , a cloud - based interoperability tool . Tool environment and interface . The portability and backward - compatibility of the Galaxy tools environment is improved significantly . Accordingly , a tool configuration now includes a tool profile version , which is used to ensure compatibility between a version of a tool and its targeted Galaxy version . In addition , tool profile versions allow for the evolution of new and better tool defaults and behav - iors while maintaining backwards compatibility . We also improved the ToolShed API and its interface to facilitate installing tools missing from an imported workflow . We im - proved the installation process so that restarting Galaxy is not required to use a newly installed tool . Interactive analysis and visualization Galaxy’s UI makes it possible for anyone to run com - plex analyses . However , a complete analysis of genomic data often requires custom scripts or visualizations , espe - cially at the beginning ( data preparation ) or end ( data sum - marization ) of analyses . To meet these customized needs , we recently introduced Galaxy Interactive Environments ( 26 ) , an integration of Galaxy with Jupyter ( RStudio is in development ) – – a commonly used interactive scripting plat - form . With Interactive Environments , Galaxy users benefit from existing computational infrastructure via both graph - ical UI and ad hoc scripting , or any combination of these . Galaxy’s visualization framework ( 27 ) makes it possible to integrate a wide variety of Web - based and server - side visualizations . Through this framework , many new visual - izations have been added to Galaxy , including Cytoscape ( 28 ) , and the WebGL enabled 3D Protein viewer NGL ( 29 ) , molecular interaction networks and macromolecular structures visualizations , and the 100 + visualizations avail - able through BioJS ( 30 ) , a rich set of community - driven JavaScript components for agile and interactive visualiza - tion of biological data . User interface and experience enhancements There are two common modes of data analysis : exploratory and pipeline execution . Galaxy enables simultaneous ac - cess to both of these . Users are able to interactively analyze their data by making use of individual tools in a trial - and - error manner . They are then able to automatically gener - ate reusable and generalizable workflows from an ad hoc analysis . An interactive workflow editor is also available to modify or generate workflows from scratch . At any point in time , a user can seamlessly switch modes between interac - tively analyzing datasets and executing a workflow on these datasets . There is no analysis lock - in , and users can exercise full control , or make use of pre - existing pipelines . Impor - tantly , these analysis artefacts , such as datasets , analysis his - tories , workflows , and visualizations can all be shared and copied by collaborators at the discretion of the analyst . Client - side infrastructure . The client - side of Galaxy , which is the user - interface most people associate with Galaxy , has seen significant changes under the hood . The usage of server - side mako templates , for example to create forms , has been further reduced and replaced by client - side only code that communicates via the RESTful Galaxy API with the backend . This minimizes the number of full - page refreshes and improves response time by enabling partial page up - dates . The interface has been further enhanced to allow for drag - and - drop of files and datasets , presents a fuzzy search on dataset and tool metadata , and implements a modal scratchbook for visualizations and comparison of multiple datasets . Nucleic Acids Research , 2018 , Vol . 46 , Web Server issue W541 Furthermore , the community has selected the Vue . js framework ( https : / / vuejs . org / ) as the base for future im - provements allowing all UI elements to converge into a more reactive and future - proof interface . With the integra - tion of Vue . js , the entire client - side build system was up - dated to utilize the latest web - technologies , to make rout - ing and loading times faster , and to encourage rapid future interface improvements . While mostly transparent to users , these changes are the fundamental groundwork of a much more flexible UI framework that will enable visual enhance - ments and an improved user experience for years to come . Tags . Although tags have been supported in Galaxy for several years , they have only recently become advantageous for large many - sample analyses . We have enhanced tags to allow propagation through dataset analysis steps . This facil - itates tracking individual datasets through the entire anal - ysis life - cycle and becomes part of the provenance system and ease - of - use of Galaxy . To enable automatic tag prop - agation , a hash - sign ( # ) is placed at the beginning of the tag , which is colloquially referred to as a named - tag . While standard Galaxy output dataset naming is suitable for many interactive analyses , the connection between inputs and out - puts through large workflows becomes increasingly less ob - vious ; by utilizing named - tags , users can label datasets with an identifier that is maintained throughout the analysis . Webhooks . Inspired by user feedback and the need to quickly modify and adapt Galaxy’s interface , we integrated a pluggable system to extend Galaxy’s frontend . Webhooks provide an entry - point into the Galaxy UI , in which it is possible to add buttons , menu entries , or entire iframes . At these entry - points a developer can dynamically add client - side code ( JavaScript , HTML , CSS ) and interact with the rest of the Galaxy user - interface . By integrating Webhooks with the Galaxy API , it is also possible to trigger server - side functions from within a Webhook . Webhooks can be thor - oughly customized and are enabled at the discretion of the Galaxy administrator . Interactive tours . We have developed self - paced , interac - tive tours that users can step through to learn about Galaxy . These tours guide users step by step through using the inter - face including tools , workflows , and other features available in Galaxy . To simplify tour creation , a Tour Builder ( https : / / github . com / TailorDev / galaxy - tourbuilder ) has been cre - ated for recording , replaying , updating and exporting tours . Improved workflows . Galaxy workflows have been ex - tended in several ways . Switching between tool versions and upgrading workflows with new tool versions is now sup - ported . A workflow can now be embedded in another , mak - ing it easier to create and edit workflows that have many common steps repeated . Many of these features have existed in in standalone workflow systems , such as Taverna ( 31 ) , for sometime , but have been widely requested by Galaxy users . Workflows are now scheduled by a Galaxy server more efficiently and in the background , making it possible to execute larger workflows , generating tens of thousands of jobs , while providing instant feedback and a snappier user - experience . We have also enhanced Galaxy with initial sup - port for running workflows defined in the Common Work - flow Language ( 32 ) format . Dataset collections . Galaxy Dataset Collections combine datasets to enable simultaneous analysis . They organize sets of datasets as potentially nested lists of objects allowing easier data handling and batch execution of tools . In ad - dition to the related frontend improvements , and support of nesting collections together , we recently introduced spe - cialized tools to be executed on collections ( e . g . Collapse , which combines a list of datasets into a single dataset , Flat - ten which takes nested collections and produces a flat list of datasets , and Merge which takes two lists and creates a sin - gle unified list ) , and enabled uploading and downloading dataset collections to and from both user’s local disk and Galaxy data libraries . Infrastructure enhancements In order to make Galaxy more robust in a production en - vironment , we adopted technologies to enhance Galaxy’s portability , security , reliability , and scalability . Galaxy now utilizes uWSGI ( http : / / projects . unbit . it / uwsgi ) as its default web application server . This adoption has several advan - tages , namely the ability to negate Python’s limitations re - garding concurrent tasks execution , built - in load balancing , scalability , improved fault tolerance and the possibility of restarting Galaxy uninterruptedly . Many tools available via Galaxy rely on the availability of reference and index data . To promote ease of use and efficient storage and compute resources , Galaxy is able to share a precomputed set of local reference data for tools to use . Previously , making this data available to the tools was a time intensive process where a Galaxy administrator had to install and properly configure the server , either manually or by using Data Managers ( 33 ) . However , this resulted in much redundant effort required for each Galaxy server be - ing configured . To streamline this process , we have made all the reference data we prepared for Galaxy Main available via a CernVM File System ( CVMFS ; ( 34 ) ) , a scalable and content - addressable file system . This repository currently hosts 5TB of pre - build reference data , which are versioned and shared publicly with read - only access . With minimal configuration , any instance of Galaxy , including Galaxy - Docker images , can attach to this file system and gain access to the same reference data available on Galaxy Main . To improve accessibility and fault - tolerance , this data source is replicated on servers located in Europe and Australia . Galaxy is powered by various open - source projects which are installed automatically , and used when needed . Galaxy is using the Conda package manager ( https : / / conda . io ) as its default tool dependency resolver , and offers support for vir - tualization and containerization technologies ( e . g . Docker ( https : / / www . docker . com ) and Singularity ( 35 ) ) to ensure a higher level of portability , if needed . By leveraging the Bio - conda ( https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1101 / 207092 ) and the BioCon - tainer ( 36 ) projects , Galaxy is able to provision and use re - producible tool execution environments ( ( 37 ) ; https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1101 / 200683 ) . Galaxy is a generic data analysis framework , which can be configured for various application scenarios using a wide W542 Nucleic Acids Research , 2018 , Vol . 46 , Web Server issue range of configuration parameters . To facilitate configuring these parameters with optimal values for a number of pre - defined application scenarios , the Galaxy project leverages Ansible ( https : / / www . ansible . com ) , software for automated configuration and management of other software pack - ages . We have developed and shared Ansible configurations for Galaxy Main , the main public Galaxy server , ( https : / / github . com / galaxyproject / usegalaxy - playbook ) and also a configurable generic playbook for setting up production instances on cloud resources , virtual machines , and bare metal ( https : / / github . com / ARTbio / GalaxyKickStart ) . This playbook can be used as a reference for configuring a Galaxy instance for a production environment . The Galaxy - Docker project ( https : / / github . com / bgruening / docker - galaxy - stable ) , delivers a production ready Galaxy instance in minutes and can be used as the basis for personalized , self - contained , portable instances of Galaxy , known as Galaxy flavors . Preconfigured by the Galaxy community , a plenitude of flavors already exist covering application scenarios , from BLAST + ( 38 , 39 ) , metagenomics ( https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1101 / 183970 ) , ChIP - exo analysis , or RNA research ( 40 ) . In addition to the facili - tated and out - of - box functionality , these images provision isolated environments well - suited for experimenting with tools and Galaxy configurations , and are ideal for training courses , as demonstrated by the Galaxy Training Network . Server monitoring and issue management is crucial in production Galaxy instances . Galaxy has integrated a plu - gin module to submit user bug - reports to configurable end - points such as mailing lists or GitHub issues . With this , Galaxy can be configured to send error reports to a lo - cal ticket system . The recent integration of Sentry ( https : / / sentry . io / ) for automated error tracking and reporting makes it easier for administrators to track both client - and server - side errors without requiring manual user bug re - ports . COMMUNITY Galaxy serves several distinct communities : researchers , tool developers , resource providers , trainers , and trainees . To centralize resources for all communities , we have devel - oped the Galaxy Community Hub ( https : / / galaxyproject . org ) for all things Galaxy . The Hub uses a modified wiki approach , with content written in Markdown , a simple for - matting language , and then built into a static website . Any - one can update the Markdown documents using GitHub pull requests , a standard approach for collaborating on code and documentation on GitHub projects . Submitted pull re - quests are reviewed and merged , and the Hub site is auto - matically regenerated and updated , resulting in high - quality reviewed content that can be updated by any member of the Galaxy community . The Hub includes a full list of pub - lic Galaxy servers ( https : / / galaxyproject . org / public - galaxy - servers ) , a large set of tutorials for learning to use Galaxy and perform genomic analyses , extensive documentation on deploying and administering a Galaxy server in the Cloud or on local hardware , and upcoming events . We also main - tain an annotated listing of the > 5000 publications refer - encing Galaxy via the free and open - source Zotero service ( https : / / www . zotero . org / groups / 1732893 / galaxy ) . The Main Galaxy server has over 124 000 registered users and ∼ 2000 new users register each month . On average , 20 000 unique users execute over 245 000 analysis jobs by ac - cessing 750 different tools every month . With such an ac - tive user - base , questions on platform and tool usage , as well as general research questions ( 41 ) , are common . To ef - ficiently assist users in performing research , we provide a Biostars ( 42 ) Question and Answers forum ( https : / / biostar . usegalaxy . org / ) that leverages the knowledge and strength of community members to provide support . This forum is monitored and moderated by core team members , but the Galaxy user community provides many answers . Help is also available through live chat with the team and commu - nity members via Gitter and IRC chat services , which are used most often by developers and administrators . In ad - dition to the online help and documentation , the Galaxy Training Network has developed comprehensive tutorials and workflows for performing common data analysis tasks , providing topic - specific introduction slides , hands - on ma - terial , sample data , and even playable Galaxy tours ( https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1101 / 225680 ) . Many in - person events that highlight and build the Galaxy community occur each year ( https : / / galaxyproject . org / events / ) . These include free or low - cost hands - on work - shops and training sessions that have been hosted by the community on six continents . The Galaxy Community Conference ( GCC ) is an annual conference that was first held in 2010 . GCC alternates between Europe and the United States , includes two full days of training , two days of coding and data analysis hackathons , and two days of oral and poster presentations . Galaxy conferences have had over two hundred attendees each year since 2012 , and over eleven hundred different researchers have attended since 2010 . Our 2018 conference will be hosted jointly with the Bioinformat - ics Open Source Conference ( BOSC ) in an effort to promote and centralize discussion of open - source software for bioin - formatics . Another core area of community focus is tool develop - ment and availability . The Intergalactic Utilities Commis - sion ( IUC ; https : / / galaxyproject . org / iuc / ) is a community - based organization that defines best - practices for tool de - velopment that help ensure the availability of high - quality tools in the ToolShed . It is a self - organizing and self - regulating group that has grown by six new members in the last two years and is primarily composed of individ - uals outside of the core Galaxy development team . The IUC is only one of many tool contributors , with the Tool - Shed allowing any member of the community to share tools that they have added to Galaxy . To assist commu - nity members with tool development and distribution , a command - line tool named Planemo ( https : / / github . com / galaxyproject / planemo ) has been developed . Planemo pro - vides functionality for verifying best - practice adherence , testing , installation and uploading of tools to the ToolShed . Community contributions have helped the Galaxy frame - work and its tool suite to grow considerably . One hun - dred and seventy - four developers , who have collectively pro - duced 13 135 commits within just the past two years ( 63 % increase since January 2016 ) , have improved Galaxy’s scal - ability , functionality , and usability . The project utilizes the Travis and Jenkins continuous integration ( CI ) services to Nucleic Acids Research , 2018 , Vol . 46 , Web Server issue W543 automatically execute comprehensive test suites on each set of proposed code changes . This strategy helps prevent the introduction of bugs to the codebase and improves re - view time . By harnessing the open - source community and modern software development practices , we are able to re - lease a new stable version of the Galaxy framework ev - ery four months . Current future directions include enabling data and compute federation ; tighter coupling of Interac - tive Environments with provenance and reuse ; ToolShed in - stallation and development enhancements ; continued work on collections , workflows , analysis interfaces and history views ; additional training material ; improving statistical us - age tracking and instrumentation ; and much more . For anyone interested in getting involved with Galaxy devel - opment , we invite them to read the project’s Contribut - ing and Code of Conduct documents , review open issues , and explore the current roadmap , all which are available from the Galaxy GitHub repository ( https : / / github . com / galaxyproject / galaxy / ) .
