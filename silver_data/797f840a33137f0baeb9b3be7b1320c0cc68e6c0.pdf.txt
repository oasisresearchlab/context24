COVID - 19 is spreading all over Iran , and Kerman is one of the most a ﬀ ected cities . We conducted this study to predict COVID - 19 - related deaths , hospitalization , and infected cases under di ﬀ erent scenarios ( scenarios A , B , and C ) by 31 December 2021 in Kerman . We also aimed to assess the impact of new COVID - 19 variants and vaccination on the total number of COVID - 19 cases , deaths , and hospitalizations ( scenarios D , E , and F ) using the modi ﬁ ed susceptible - exposed - infected - removed ( SEIR ) model . We calibrated the model using deaths reported from the start of the epidemic to August 30 , 2021 . A Monte Carlo Markov Chain ( MCMC ) uncertainty analysis was used to estimate 95 % uncertainty intervals ( UI ) . We also calculated the time - varying reproductive number ( R t ) following time - dependent methods . Under the worst - case scenario ( scenario A ; contactrate = 10 , self ‐ isolation rate = 30 % , and average vaccination shots per day = 5 , 000 ) , the total number of infections by December 31 , 2021 , would be 1 , 625 , 000 ( 95 % UI : 1 , 112 , 000 – 1 , 898 , 000 ) with 6 , 700 deaths ( 95 % UI : 5 , 200 – 8 , 700 ) . With the presence of alpha and delta variants without vaccine ( scenario D ) , the total number of infected cases and the death toll were estimated to be 957 , 000 ( 95 % UI : 208 , 000 – 1 , 463 , 000 ) and 4 , 500 ( 95 % UI : 1 , 500 – 7 , 000 ) , respectively . If 70 % of the population were vaccinated when the alpha variant was dominant ( scenario E ) , the total number of infected cases and deaths would be 608 , 000 ( 95 % UI : 122 , 000 – 743 , 000 ) and 2 , 700 ( 95 % UI : 700 – 4 , 000 ) , respectively . The R t was ≥ 1 almost every day during the epidemic . Our results suggest that policymakers should concentrate on improving vaccination and interventions , such as reducing social contacts , stricter limitations for gathering , public education to promote social distancing , incensing case ﬁ nding and contact tracing , e ﬀ ective isolation , and quarantine to prevent more COVID - 19 cases , hospitalizations , and deaths in Kerman .

Introduction SARS - CoV - 2 and its newly emerging variants continue to spread worldwide [ 1 ] . As of November 3 , 2021 , a total num - ber of 248 , 590 , 953 COVID - 19 cases and 5 , 034 , 002 COVID - 19 - related deaths have been reported globally [ 2 ] . Iran is one of the most a ﬀ ected countries by COVID - 19 . The ﬁ rst con ﬁ rmed cases of COVID - 19 in Iran were reported on Feb - ruary 19 , 2020 [ 3 ] , and since then , COVID - 19 has spread rapidly across the country . Until November 3 , 2020 , the Ira - nian Ministry of Health and Medical Education has reported more than 5 , 954 , 962 con ﬁ rmed COVID - 19 cases and 126 , 763 COVID - 19 - related deaths in Iran [ 4 ] . Kerman Prov - ince , located in the southeast of the country , is the largest province of Iran , with a population of about 3 million people [ 5 ] . The ﬁ rst two cases of COVID - 19 in Kerman were identi - ﬁ ed in early March 2020 [ 6 ] . During the following months , COVID - 19 - related hospitalized cases increased to 40 , 765 , and COVID - 19 - related deaths reached 4 , 825 in the prov - ince [ 7 ] . Upon the onset of the COVID - 19 epidemic in Iran , the government started implementing various nonpharmaceuti - cal interventions ( NPIs ) , such as social distancing , closure of universities and schools all over the country , reduction of o ﬃ cial work hours , limiting public gatherings , restriction of travel to or from cities with the high case numbers , and extensive lockdown of high - risk occupations [ 8 – 10 ] . Active contact tracing and increasing testing on outpatients have also been performed to prevent the spread of COVID - 19 . Moreover , all patients were trained on self - isolation princi - ples and home - based care . The emergence of di ﬀ erent SARS - CoV - 2 variants has posed challenges to epidemic control e ﬀ orts in Iran . In early June 2021 , the delta variant spread throughout Iran , espe - cially in Kerman ’ s southern neighbouring provinces ( e . g . , Sistan and Baluchistan ) [ 11 , 12 ] . Although the e ﬀ ectiveness of vaccines to symptomatic infection against emergent vari - ants of the virus ( e . g . , delta ) is decreasing ( > 70 % compared to the alpha variant ) [ 13 ] , vaccines have shown good e ﬃ cacy against severe disease , hospitalization , and death . In Febru - ary 2021 , the vaccination program was implemented , prior - itizing older adults and health care workers in Iran . As of November 20 , 2021 , 44 . 7 million people ( 53 . 2 % of the total population ) have been fully vaccinated [ 14 ] . A range of dif - ferent COVID - 19 vaccines , including Sinopharm vaccine , Oxford – AstraZeneca vaccine , COVIran Barekat , Sputnik V , PastoCovac , and Covaxin , have been administered in Iran [ 11 ] . The vaccination program in Kerman was initiated in mid - February 2021 , and as of November 3 , 2021 , approxi - mately 1 , 945 , 600 ( 61 . 4 % of the total population ) had received at least one dose of the vaccine , and 1 , 260 , 475 ( 39 . 8 % of the total population ) had received the second dose [ 7 ] . Dynamic mathematical models are e ﬀ ective tools for health policymakers to understand the transmission mecha - nisms of COVID - 19 and predict COVID - 19 - related new cases and deaths [ 15 ] . The susceptible - exposed - infected - removed ( SEIR ) model is a forecasting model widely adopted to estimate epidemiological parameters of infectious diseases [ 16 – 18 ] . SEIR has been frequently used for model - ing COVID - 19 [ 10 , 19 – 21 ] . For instance , deterministic SEIR and travel network - based SEIR models were used to assess the impact of various NPIs against COVID - 19 [ 22 – 24 ] . Moreover , the SEIR model was used to estimate the trans - mission risk of COVID - 19 and the e ﬀ ectiveness of contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation in China [ 25 ] . Stochastic SEIR models have also been used to assess the impact of contact tracing and isolation on COVID - 19 [ 26 ] . After the arrival of vaccination and new variants , mathemat - ical models were developed to evaluate the impact of the vac - cination and new variants on the population . For example , mathematical models have helped assess the impact of SARS - CoV - 2 variants and vaccination campaigns on the spread of COVID - 19 [ 27 , 28 ] . Furthermore , mathematical models have illustrated COVID - 19 transmission mechanism with vaccination [ 29 ] and helped assess the impact of NPIs , vaccination , and the SARS - CoV - 2 delta variant in England [ 30 ] . Several studies have also calculated the time - varying e ﬀ ective reproduction number to evaluate the e ﬀ ectiveness of NPIs in several studies [ 31 – 34 ] . We modi ﬁ ed a SEIR model for COVID - 19 epidemic parameters to estimate the epidemic trend in the near future and the peak date under various epidemic scenarios in Iran ’ s Kerman Province . We aimed to quantify timely vaccination programs , NPIs implemented by the government , and rate of self - isolation observed by patients and investigate the impact of three SARS - CoV - 2 variants . Consequently , the aim of the current study was twofold : ﬁ rst , to predict Ker - man ’ s COVID - 19 - related deaths , hospitalization , and infected cases under di ﬀ erent scenarios by December 31 , 2021 , and second , to assess the impact of new COVID - 19 variants and vaccination on infected cases , death toll , and hospitalizations . The results of the model may provide a basis for public health practitioners and policymakers in adopting and promoting policies and strategies to prevent the rapid spread of COVID - 19 in Kerman and potentially other parts of the country . 2 . Methods 2 . 1 . Mathematical Model . A modi ﬁ ed SEIR compartmental model was used to predict the total number of infected cases , deaths , and hospitalizations . We used the modeling framework based on previous work in Iran [ 35 ] . The model was calibrated based on epidemiological and clinical data from Kerman . We used the SEIRDI s HTV 1 V 2 model with the following compartments : susceptible ( S ) , latent ( E ) , infected ( I ) , recovered ( R ) , deaths ( D ) , isolated ( I s ) , hospitalized ( H ) , temporary isolation units ( T ) , at least one dose vaccination ( V 1 ) , and fully vaccinated ( V 2 ) ( Figure 1 ) . Susceptible individuals were those at risk of becoming infected by SARS - CoV - 2 . In our model , the total population of Kerman ( 3 , 165 , 000 ) was assumed as susceptible [ 5 ] . Infected people could transmit the infec - tion after exposure to SARS - CoV - 2 and during the latency period . However , exposed individuals could transmit the infection to susceptible individuals after the latency period ( assuming the latent period and incubation period to be 2 Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine equal ) . We considered that infected individuals could be classi ﬁ ed into four stages : ( a ) were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms and did not isolate themselves to recover after the infectious period , ( b ) were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms and self - isolated after showing clinical symptoms then recovered , ( c ) had severe symptoms and needed to go to the hospital after the onset of COVID - 19 symptoms , and ( d ) died without being hospitalized . Moreover , some hospitalized individuals may die , and some admitted to temporary isolation units may recover . It was assumed that a proportion of recovered and sus - ceptible individuals belong to partially vaccinated ( i . e . , peo - ple who received at least one dose of vaccine ) and then to the fully vaccinated compartment ( i . e . , received two doses ) . Furthermore , we assumed that people who received the vac - cine could be infected again with other variants ; however , the rate of death and hospitalization was lower than those who did not receive a vaccine . The vaccines used in Iran are mostly Sinopharm and AstraZeneca . The e ﬀ ectiveness of one dose of vaccine was assumed 50 % , and the e ﬀ ective - ness of two doses was 70 % [ 13 ] . In June 2021 , the delta var - iant entered Kerman and spread across the province . On August 18 alone , about 32 people died in the province , which was the highest number of COVID - 19 - related deaths since the beginning of the pandemic [ 7 ] . In the model , we considered the e ﬀ ect of the delta variant from June 10 , 2021 [ 12 ] . A proportion of recovered individuals would pro - ceed into the susceptible group due to reinfection risk with the delta variant [ 36 ] . However , we assumed that the mortal - ity rate and hospitalization rate for reinfection were lower for people who were not infected . The di ﬀ erential equations for each compartment are described in the Supplementary Material ( Appnedix 1 ) . 2 . 2 . Calibration and Parameters . We calibrated our model to generate the epidemic trend in Kerman based on the observed deaths from February 4 , 2020 , to August 30 , 2021 ( Figure 2 ) . Parameters were used from literature review and expert opinion , as well as Kerman and national empiri - cal data . Contact rate , self - isolation rate , and average vacci - nation shots per day were changed based on the government interventions to observe the best ﬁ t between deaths in the model and real data . We used a Monte Carlo Markov Chain ( MCMC ) uncertainty analysis to obtain 95 % uncertainty intervals ( UI ) around model estimates . We computed probability distributions for the model parameters , and 10 , 000 simulations were undertaken using a random sample . Therefore , for each day , we had 10 , 000 infected cases , deceased cases , and hospitalized cases . More - over , the 2 . 5 th and 97 . 5 th percentiles and the mean of each 10 , 000 number were reported . MCMC uncertainty analysis was used during the process of calibration . More informa - tion about calibration is presented in the Supplementary Material ( Appendix 2 ) . The model parameters , de ﬁ nitions , values , and distribution are shown in Table 1 in the Supple - mentary Material ( Appnedix 1 ) .

Susceptible individuals who have not received vaccine and are not infected go to the exposed compartment . However , reinfected individuals or people who received the vaccine go to exposed 1 compartment . 3 Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine 2 . 3 . Scenarios . We assumed that the contact rate was 13 before diagnosing the ﬁ rst case in Iran [ 37 – 39 ] . We cali - brated the contact rate parameters based on the interven - tions implemented in Kerman . The average household size was considered as 4 . 3 in Kerman Province . Therefore , the minimum contact rate was estimated to be 5 . Moreover , we assumed that 10 % of patients self - isolated without any intervention . When Kerman ’ s ﬁ rst case was diagnosed , self - isolation increased to 15 % due to increased public awareness . After March 1 st , the self - isolation rate increased due to patient self - reports through http : / / www . salamat . gov . ir / and case ﬁ nding through the 4030 system [ 6 ] . COVID - 19 vaccination started in early February 2021 . In the begin - ning , the average number of vaccination shots per day was approximately 120 ; however , it has increased to an average daily number of 13 , 000 people . We calibrated the contact rate , self - isolation rate , and average vaccination shots per day from February 4 , 2020 , to August 30 , 2021 , shown in Table 1 . In our model , six scenarios were presented , three of which predicted the total number of COVID - 19 cases , deaths , and hospitalizations in Kerman from August 31 , 2021 , to December 31 , 2021 , ( scenarios A , B , and C ) . For scenario A , the contact rate , self - isolation rate , and average vaccination shots per day were assumed to be 10 , 30 % , and 5 , 000 , respectively ( the worst - case scenario ) ; for scenario B , the contact rate , self - isolation rate , and average vaccination shots per day were assumed to be 8 , 40 % , and 10 , 000 , respec - tively ( the moderate - case scenario ) ; and for scenario C , the contact rate , self - isolation rate , and average vaccination shots per day were assumed to be 6 , 50 % , and 15 , 000 , respec - tively ( the best - case scenario ) . In these scenarios , contact rates , self - isolation rates , and average vaccination shots per day were modi ﬁ ed to December 31 , 2021 . Moreover , three scenarios ( D , E , and F ) examined the impacts of new COVID - 19 variants and vaccination . In sce - nario D , we assumed that vaccination programs were not implemented with alpha and delta variants ; in scenario E , we assumed that 70 % of the population were vaccinated before the delta variant entered in Kerman ( only with the presence of the alpha variant ) ; in scenario F , we assumed that alpha , lambda , and delta variants were spread out simultaneously in June , and the vaccination rate was consid - ered like the calibrated model . Our model was calibrated based on Kerman ’ s death toll from February 04 , 2020 , to August 30 , 2021 . The interventions were changed during this period to evaluate new SARS - CoV - 2 variants ’ impact and vaccination and compared with the calibrated model . The total number of COVID - 19 cases , deaths , and hospital - izations were estimated under each scenario . 2 . 4 . Time - Varying Reproductive Number ( R t ) . The basic reproduction number ( R 0 ) is the average number of second - ary infections produced by an infected individual in a sus - ceptible population during the infectious period . R 0 is used when there is no immunity , vaccination , or intervention . The time - varying reproductive number ( R t ) is de ﬁ ned as the average number of secondary cases generated by primary cases when speci ﬁ ed interventions ( e . g . , quarantine or isola - tion ) are implemented . We calculated R t with the time - dependent method based on the death toll in Kerman ( see Appendix 3 in the Supplementary Material for more details ) .

Results Under scenario A ( the worst - case scenario ) , it is anticipated that the total number of infected cases by December 31 , 2021 , would be 1 , 625 , 000 ( 95 % UI : 1 , 112 , 000 – 1 , 898 , 000 ) . Besides , the total number of hospitalized cases by December 31 , 2021 , is anticipated to be 83 , 000 ( 95 % UI : 14 , 000 – 120 , 000 ) . The total number of deaths is estimated to be 6 , 700 ( 95 % UI : 5 , 200 – 8 , 700 ) . Under scenario B ( the moder - ate scenario ) , the total number of infected cases by Decem - ber 31 , 2021 , is estimated to be 1 , 247 , 000 ( 95 % UI : 815 , 000 – 1 , 583 , 000 ) . The total number of hospitalized cases and death toll by December 31 , 2021 , is estimated to be 63 , 000 ( 95 % UI : 11 , 000 – 95 , 000 ) and 5 , 600 ( 95 % UI : 2 , 800 – 8 , 000 ) , respectively . Under scenario F ( the best - case sce - nario ) , the total number of infected cases by December 31 , 2021 , is expected to be 1 , 066 , 000 ( 95 % UI : 686 , 000 – 1 , 347 , 000 ) . The total number of hospitalized and death cases by December 31 , 2021 , is expected to be 55 , 000 ( 95 % UI : 9 , 000 – 82 , 000 ) and 5 , 200 ( 95 % UI : 2 , 000 – 7 , 500 ) , respectively ( Table 2 ) . The estimated numbers of newly infected cases per day , existing hospitalized cases , and the number of deaths under di ﬀ erent scenarios from February 29 , 2020 , to December 31 , 2021 , are shown in Figures 3 – 5 . It is predicted that the total number of infected cases under scenario D would be 957 , 000 ( 95 % UI : 208 , 000 – 1 , 463 , 000 ) . Under this scenario , the death toll and total number of hospitalized cases up to August 30 , 2021 , would be 4 , 500 ( 95 % UI : 1 , 500 – 7 , 000 ) and 46 , 000 ( 95 % UI : 10 , 000 – 70 , 000 ) , respectively . Under scenario E , it is esti - mated that the total number of infected cases and the death toll up to August 30 , 2021 , would be 608 , 000 ( 95 % UI : 122 , 000 – 743 , 000 ) and 2 , 700 ( 95 % UI : 700 – 4 , 000 ) . The total number of hospitalized cases in this scenario would be 31 , 000 ( 95 % UI : 5 , 000 – 45 , 000 ) .

It is estimated that the total number of death and the total number of hospitalized cases under scenario F would be 5 , 000 ( 95 % UI : 1 , 500 – 7 , 500 ) and 54 , 000 ( 95 % UI : 13 , 000 – 115 , 000 ) , respectively ( Table 3 ) . 3 . 1 . Time - Varying Reproductive Number ( R t ) . We calculated R t with a time - dependent method based on the number of deaths in Kerman . R t was 2 . 6 when Kerman ’ s ﬁ rst con ﬁ rmed COVID - 19 - related deaths were reported in early March . It was reduced to < 1 when strict limitations were implemented until mid - April . R t was lower than one from mid - August to mid - September 2020 and from late November 2020 to late January 2021 . Unfortunately , the trend of R t has increased to ≥ 1 almost every day during the epidemic ( Figure 6 ) . 4 . Discussion We used an SEIR mathematical model to estimate the trend of the COVID - 19 outbreak in Kerman , Iran . We also assessed timely vaccination programs , NPIs implemented by the government , and rate of self - isolation observed by patients and investigated the impact of three variants that were spread out simultaneously . The innovation of our study was the evaluation of three COVID - 19 variants ( alpha , delta , and lambda ) simultaneously with and without vaccination programs . The results of this study suggested that if the vac - cination programs were not implemented when alpha and delta variants spread out , the number of infected cases , hos - pitalizations , and deaths would have increased by 31 % , 30 % , and 28 % , respectively .

Unfortunately , due to the economic sanctions and the economic loss caused by the spread of COVID - 19 in Iran , most economic interventions were gradually cancelled , and the number of COVID - 19 cases has sharply risen in Iran [ 40 , 41 ] . Suppression measures , highly e ﬀ ective contact trac - ing , and vaccination can reduce the disease burden . How - ever , suppression measures have a devastating economic impact , particularly when preserved for a long time ; there - fore , it is urgent to enhance the rate of vaccination and F e b 29 M a y 29 A u g 29 N o v 29 F e b 28 M a y 28 A u g 28 N o v 28 2000 1500 1000 500 0 N u m b e r o f e x i s t i n g h o s p i t a l i z e d c a s e s Scenario A Scenario B Scenario C ( a ) F e b 29 M a y 29 A u g 29 N o v 29 F e b 28 M a y 28 A u g 28 2500 2000 1500 1000 500 0 N u m b e r o f e x i s t i n g h o s p i t a l i z e d c a s e s Calibrated model Scenario D Scenario E Senario F ( b ) Figure 4 : The estimated number of existing hospitalized cases in Kerman under di ﬀ erent scenarios . ∗ The black line shows the calibration for August 30 , and each line is the mean of multiple runs .

Indeed , several studies have shown that the most e ﬀ ective way to diminish the transmission of COVID - 19 is high vaccination coverage [ 42 , 43 ] . Our results demonstrate that vaccination can reduce COVID - 19 - related mortality rate by around 90 % , which aligns with vaccine e ﬀ ectiveness studies [ 44 , 45 ] . Moreover , contact tracing and case isolation are other low - cost ways to control the COVID - 19 epidemic . Hellewell et al . showed that COVID - 19 could be controlled within three months via e ﬀ ective con - tact tracing and case isolation [ 26 ] . Studies have indicated that the new SARS - CoV - 2 vari - ants have signi ﬁ cantly increased the risk of death and hospi - talizations [ 28 , 46 – 48 ] . Our results show that the three COVID - 19 variants simultaneously increased the mortality and hospitalization rate by approximately 20 % and 40 % , respectively . To prevent the e ﬀ ect of new variants , vaccina - tion of at least 70 % of people could reduce deaths and hos - pitalization [ 49 ] . In addition to vaccination , other interventions , such as reducing social contacts , stricter limi - tations for gathering , public education to promote social dis - tancing , incensing case ﬁ nding and contact tracing , e ﬀ ective isolation , and quarantine , can reduce the transmission rate . Moreover , we also predicted the number of deaths , infec - tions , and hospitalizations in Kerman . In scenario A ( worst - case scenario ) , the results indicate that more than 1 , 600 , 000 COVID - 19 infections will occur in Kerman until December 31 , 2021 , of whom 5 . 1 % will be hospitalized , and 0 . 41 % will die . However , in the best - case scenario ( i . e . , scenario C ) , the number of infected , hospitalizations , and deaths could be reduced by 35 % , 34 % , and 23 % , respectively . Based on sce - nario A ( the worst - case scenario ) , the total number of exist - ing hospitalized cases on September 18 , 2021 , was about 1 , 200 cases which is indeed very concerning given the avail - ability of only 300 ICU beds and 150 ventilators to COVID - 19 patients in Kerman Province . In the current study , R t decreased to < 1 from mid - March to mid - April due to interventions enforced by public health agencies starting from February 19 . However , after mid - April , R t increased gradually , and it has been > 1 , which is consistent with other studies conducted in Iran [ 50 , 51 ] . Also , our results show that without administration of vacci - nation and when the alpha and delta variants were domi - nant , R t would be > 1 , and the epidemic would be out of control . The results are consistent with other studies which assess the impact of new COVID - 19 variants and vaccines [ 27 , 28 ] . These results highlight the importance of reducing R t < 1 with improving vaccination coverage before other new COVID - 19 variants appear . We acknowledge the limitations of the study . First , some key parameters of the model , including the incubation period , hospitalization rate , and transmission probability , were derived from expert opinions or other countries due to Iran ’ s unavailability of empirical data . To overcome this limitation , a range of uncertainty intervals were reported . Second , we considered some assumptions ( e . g . , the whole population was considered susceptible , assumed homogene - ity of the susceptible and infectious population , and ignored migration rate between cities and the network topology in the model ) . Third , we could not present 95 % uncertainty intervals in the ﬁ gures because there was overlap between uncertainty intervals in di ﬀ erent scenarios . If we wanted to report 95 % uncertainty intervals , we had to report each sce - nario separately . Notwithstanding these limitations , the results of this study provided a foundation to evaluate the in ﬂ uence of interventions undertaken in Kerman under dif - ferent scenarios . 5 . Conclusion Our data suggest that the most e ﬀ ective way to reduce the transmission of COVID - 19 in Kerman is through high vac - cination coverage . Also , the three COVID - 19 variants simul - taneously increased the risk of deaths and hospitalization rate by 20 % and 40 % , respectively .
