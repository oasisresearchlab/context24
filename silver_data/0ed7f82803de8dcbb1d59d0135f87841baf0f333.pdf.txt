In English , ‘animal’ can refer either to ( a ) exclusively non - human animals , or ( b ) all animate beings ( human and non - human animals ) . In Indonesian , this category of animate beings has no dedicated name . Here , we ask whether this diﬀ erence in naming has consequences for children’s reasoning about humans and non - human animals . Results from English - and Indonesian - speaking children reveals diﬀ erences in reasoning at age 6 , diﬀ erences that become attenuated by age 9 . Th ese results suggest that not only naming practices , but also biologically - relevant formal and informal learning experiences , inﬂ uence children’s reasoning about biological concepts . Keywords Naming , conceptual development , folkbiology , induction In recent years , a great deal of research has been devoted to the study of folk - biology , or people’s everyday knowledge of living things . One goal of this endeavor has been to discover how young children acquire fundamental bio - logical concepts such as animal , plant and living thing . 1 It has been pro - posed that children’s acquisition of these biological concepts is shaped by the naming practice in their language community ( Stavy and Wax , 1989 ; Hatano et al . , 1993 ; Waxman , 2005 ; Anggoro et al . , 2008 ) . Th is proposal is consistent with extensive evidence that naming supports the formation of object categories from infancy ( see Waxman and Lidz , 2006 , for a review ) 1 Small capitals denote concepts ; single - quotes denote their ‘names’ . 172 F . K . Anggoro et al . / Journal of Cognition and Culture 10 ( 2010 ) 171 – 187 through adulthood ( Goss , 1961 ) . For example , when infants are presented with a set of disparate exemplars ( e . g . , a dog , horse , duck ) of a given object category , they have diﬃ culty noticing the category - based relation among them ( e . g . , animal ) . But when the same exemplars are introduced in conjunction with a common name , their categorization improves dramatically ( Waxman and Markow , 1995 ; Waxman , 1999 ; Fulkerson and Waxman , 2007 ) . If naming supports object categorization in infants and young children , and if object categories serve as a basis for inductive inference , then the names children learn for biological entities should inﬂ uence the categories they estab - lish and their inductive strength . To address this possibility , Anggoro et al . ( 2008 ) considered whether and how cross - linguistic diﬀ erences in naming practices associated with biological entities inﬂ uence children’s categorization . Th is work focused on two languages – English and Indonesian – because there are cross - linguistic diﬀ erences in the way that fundamental biological catego - ries are named ( see Figure 1 ) . In English , the word ‘animal’ can be applied to the category of non - human animals , excluding humans ( glossed in Figure 1 as animal contrastive ) or to the category of all animate beings , including humans ( animal inclusive ) . In Indonesian , as in English , ‘animal’ can be applied to the category of non - human animals , excluding humans ( animal contrastive ) , but in contrast to English , there is no dedicated name for the overarching category of animate beings . Anggoro and colleagues demonstrated that children are sensitive to the use of the term ‘animal’ in their respective languages . Th ey presented 6 - and 9 - year - old English - and Indonesian - speaking children with a photograph of a human and asked , “Could you call this an ‘animal’ ? ” ( “Mungkinkah ini ‘hewan’ ? ” in Indonesian ) . Only 3 % of the Indonesian - speaking children responded in the aﬃ rmative , suggesting that they overwhelmingly endorsed the animal contrastive interpretation . In contrast , 26 % of the English - speaking children responded in the aﬃ rmative , suggesting that they endorsed the ani - mal inclusive interpretation . Despite this cross - linguistic diﬀ erence in children’s tendency to endorse the animal inclusive interpretation , children in both lan - guage communities favored the animal contrastive interpretation . 2 Th is cross - linguistic diﬀ erence converges well with other evidence that Eng - lish - speaking children are willing to apply ‘animal’ to humans . In a survey of children’s conceptions of animals , Bell and Barker ( 1982 ) asked 5 - to 14 - year - old English - speaking children in New Zealand whether an X is an ‘animal’ , 2 Indeed , when elementary school , junior high , and college students were asked to name ﬁ ve animals , they never listed humans ( Trowbridge and Mintzes , 1985 ) . F . K . Anggoro et al . / Journal of Cognition and Culture 10 ( 2010 ) 171 – 187 173 where X was either a living or nonliving thing ( e . g . , person , worm , spider , ﬁ re ) . Children’s spontaneous responses revealed that 40 % of the 5 - year - olds , 74 % of the 9 - to 10 - year - olds and 68 % of the 14 - year - olds agreed that a per - son is an animal . Th is provides converging evidence that the animal inclusive interpretation is accessible to English - speaking children . Th e diﬀ erence between English and Indonesian naming practices is evident not only in children’s explicit judgment tasks , but also in their spontaneous categorization . Anggoro et al . ( 2008 ) presented 6 - and 9 - year - old English - and Indonesian - speaking children with a set of cards depicting various living and non - living things , and asked them to put “the things that go together in the same pile . ” Performance on this free - sorting task mirrored their explicit judgments ( described above ) : Only 5 % of the Indonesian - speaking children placed a human and non - human animal in the same sorting pile , but 36 % of their English - speaking counterparts did so . Th ese ﬁ ndings suggest that in English , but not Indonesian , the word ‘ani - mal’ is polysemous : It can refer to two hierarchically - nested concepts , one that includes humans ( animal inclusive ) and one that excludes them ( animal contrastive ) . What consequences , if any , does this have on children’s acquisition of the biological concept living thing ? We know that children tend to avoid poly - semy , as evidenced by their preference for a “one word – one concept” approach in word learning ( Markman and Wachtel , 1988 ) . Th us , it is possible that in an attempt to circumvent the polysemy of ‘animal’ , English - speaking children Figure 1 . A schematic depiction of English and Indonesian names for funda - mental biological concepts . Note that the node corresponding to animate or animal inclusive is unnamed in Indonesian . English ‘living thing’ ‘animal’ ( INCLUSIVE ) ‘animal’ ( CONTRASTIVE ) ‘human’ ‘plant’ Indonesian unnamed ‘makhlukhidup’ ‘hewan’ ‘manusia’ ‘tumbuhan’ 174 F . K . Anggoro et al . / Journal of Cognition and Culture 10 ( 2010 ) 171 – 187 would ( mis ) align a diﬀ erent word – ‘alive’ – to the animal inclusive category , reserving the term ‘animal’ for animal contrastive . In a subsequent study , Anggoro et al . found support for this hypothesis . Th ey asked 4 - to 9 - year - old English - and Indonesian - speaking children to sort living and non - living things based on the predicates ‘alive’ , ‘die’ , and ‘grow’ . By age 6 , English - and Indonesian - speaking children applied the predicates ‘die’ and ‘grow’ appropriately to humans , non - human animals and plants , sug - gesting that children appreciate the overarching biological category living thing . In contrast , children’s mastery of ‘alive’ was more protracted : Half of the English - and Indonesian - speaking 6 - year - olds applied ‘alive’ to systemati - cally exclude plants . By age 9 , however , a cross - linguistic diﬀ erence emerged : Although most English - speaking 9 - year - olds continued to exclude plants , aligning ‘alive’ with the animal inclusive category , Indonesian - speaking children applied ‘alive’ broadly to all living things . Additional support for the inﬂ uence of language - speciﬁ c naming practices comes from a corpus analysis of parent - child conversations in English and Indonesian ( Leddon et al . , under revision ) : English - speaking parents tended to use ‘die’ to refer to humans , non - human animals and plants , but to use ‘alive’ to refer only to humans and non - human animals , excluding plants . Converging evidence for English - speaking children’s tendency to align ‘alive’ with animal inclusive comes from English - speaking children’s performance in a sorting task that included pictures of humans , non - human animals , plants , and nonliving things ( Leddon et al . , 2008 ) . When they were instructed to sort using the predicate ‘alive’ , even 9 - and 10 - year - olds tended to exclude plants . But when ‘alive’ was replaced with ‘living thing’ , even 6 - year - olds included plants along with the humans and non - human animals . Th is is consistent with the hypothesis that English - speaking children ( mis ) align ‘alive’ with animal inclusive ( which permits them to circumvent the polysemy of ‘animal’ ) . Taken together , these ﬁ ndings suggest that the names children hear inﬂ uence the acquisition and organization of fundamental biological concepts . In the current paper , we take this hypothesis one step further . If naming practices have consequences for children’s conceptual organization , then we should observe systematic diﬀ erences between English - and Indonesian - speak - ing children’s use of biological categories in reasoning . To address this ques - tion , we employed a category - based induction task that has been instrumental in developmental investigations of biological reasoning ( e . g . , Carey , 1985 ; Gelman , 1988 ; Ross et al . , 2003 ; Herrmann et al . , under review ) . In this task , children are introduced to a novel property of an entity ( the base ) , and then asked whether this property can be generalized to other entities ( the targets ) . F . K . Anggoro et al . / Journal of Cognition and Culture 10 ( 2010 ) 171 – 187 175 For example , children may be taught that dogs have a novel biological prop - erty ( e . g . , an omentum ) , and asked whether other entities ( typically including a range of animals , plants and artifacts ) share this property . Children as young as 2 . 5 years of age use categories as an inductive base in this task : Th ey are more likely to generalize a novel property to other members of the same category than to members of a diﬀ erent category ( e . g . , Gelman and Markman , 1986 ; Gelman , 1988 ; Kalish and Gelman , 1992 ; Waxman et al . , 1997 ; see Gelman and Kalish , 2006 for a review ) . Th is naming eﬀ ect is robust : It holds up whether the categories are familiar or unfamiliar , and the eﬀ ect is evident not only in children but also in adults ( Carnaghi et al . , 2008 ) and infants as young as 13 months of age ( Waxman and Booth , 2001 ; Graham et al . , 2004 ; Keates and Graham , 2008 ) . Moreover , children’s patterns of induction may be sensitive to which cate - gory serves as the base and which as the target . For example , there is consider - able evidence that children’s inductions are asymmetric : Young urban children raised in the USA are more likely to generalize a novel property from a human ( base ) to a dog ( target ) than from a dog ( base ) to a human ( target ) ( Carey , 1985 ; Ross et al . , 2003 ; Medin and Waxman , 2007 ) . Because we include chil - dren raised in urban US communities in the current study , and because we suspect that this asymmetry may be related to the polysemy of ‘animal’ in English , we consider the potential sources of this human – non - human animal asymmetry in some detail here . Medin and Waxman ( 2007 ) review evidence suggesting that distinctive fea - tures of target categories ( including their category names ) limit generalization from a base to a target . Notice that English - speaking children may be inﬂ u - enced by the two possible meanings of the name ‘animal’ : animal contrastive and animal inclusive . We suspect that when a non - human animal serves as the base , English - speaking children will favor the animal contrastive category . Because this does not include humans , they should be relatively unlikely to generalize to the human target . In contrast , when a human serves as the base , English - speaking children may access the animal inclusive category . Because this does include both humans and non - human animals , accessing this category should support their generalization from a human base to non - human animal targets . Put diﬀ erently , when a property is attributed to a non - human animal base and a human appears as the target , English - speaking children may be reluctant to generalize on grounds that “people are not animals” ( this is the animal contrastive interpretation ) . But when the direction of inference is reversed , children should be less likely to make the appeal that “animals are not people” . In sum , English - speaking children’s access to the animal inclusive category ( a category that should be less available to Indonesian - speaking children ) may account for 176 F . K . Anggoro et al . / Journal of Cognition and Culture 10 ( 2010 ) 171 – 187 their asymmetries favoring generalizations from humans than from nonhu - man animals ( see Medin and Waxman , 2007 , for a detailed account ) . On either of the above descriptions , human – non - human animal asymme - tries should be attenuated in Indonesian - speaking children , if they are evident at all . After all , as we have pointed out , the Indonesian names for human ( ‘manusia’ ) and non - human animal ( ‘hewan’ ) refer to mutually exclusive categories . Th erefore , children’s tendency to generalize from either a human or non - human animal base should be associated with the distinctive category of the target ( human or non - human animal ) . By the same logic , when a prop - erty is introduced on a non - human animal base , English - and Indonesian - speaking children should perform comparably for both human and non - human animal targets . Finally , because factors other than naming practices alone shape children’s biological reasoning , we expect that the diﬀ erences between English - and Indonesian - speaking children’s patterns of induction will become less pro - nounced over development , as children from both communities gain access to other sources of information about biological phenomena . Th at is , cultural practices ( including naming and belief systems ) may have the strongest eﬀ ects on the youngest children ; as children get older and are exposed to a broader range of biologically - relevant information , these cultural eﬀ ects may be atten - uated ( see Waxman et al . , 2007 , for evidence to this eﬀ ect ) . One other design feature bears mention : Because our primary goal is to focus on language diﬀ erences , we sought to minimize other diﬀ erences between our English - and Indonesian - speaking populations . We , therefore , selected children living in urban communities ( Chicago and Jakarta , respectively ) and attending schools in which the curriculum was based on a Western scientiﬁ c model . Th ese schools served families with comparable relative socioeconomic status and religious aﬃ liations ( predominantly Christian ) . As urban residents , these children had roughly comparable interactions with the natural world . Method Participants Participants were 6 - year - olds ( English N = 56 , M = 6 . 25 ; Indonesian N = 52 , M = 6 . 38 ) and 9 - year - olds ( English N = 39 , M = 9 . 41 ; Indonesian N = 51 , M = 9 . 31 ) recruited from public schools in greater Chicago and a combination of public and private schools in Jakarta . At each age and site , approximately 57 % of the children were girls . Th e Chicago sample was comprised of 32 % White , 22 % Black , 16 % Hispanic , 12 % Multiracial , 11 % Middle Eastern and 8 % Asian . F . K . Anggoro et al . / Journal of Cognition and Culture 10 ( 2010 ) 171 – 187 177 All children were proﬁ cient in English , and most ( 72 % ) spoke English as their ﬁ rst language . Th e highest education level among Chicago parents in our sam - ple was 14 % master’s or higher , 33 % bachelor’s , 20 % some college , 19 % high school , and 2 % less than high school . Th e Jakarta school population was com - prised of approximately 58 % Native Indonesian and 42 % Chinese Indone - sian . All children spoke Indonesian as their ﬁ rst language . Th e highest education level among the parents in the Jakarta school population was approximately 4 % master’s or higher , 23 % bachelor’s , 54 % high school , and 19 % less than high school . All children completed a category - based induction task . We included in our analyses only those children who generalized the novel property from its base to a target of the same kind ( e . g . , from a human base to a human target ; from a dog base to a dog target ) on at least three of the four trials . Ten children failed to reach this criterion ( eight 6 - year - olds ( 2 English , 6 Indonesian ) and two 9 - year - olds ( both Indonesian ) ) . Materials Materials were 15 colored photographs depicting a range of living and non - living entities . Four of the entities served as bases ; the remaining 11 served as targets ( see Table 1 ) . We selected items that were deemed familiar to both Chicago and Jakarta children . Each photograph was presented on an 8 . 5 inch by 5 . 5 inch laminated card . Procedure Children were tested individually in a quiet place in their school . As a warm - up , and to ensure children’s familiarity with the depicted entities , the experi - menter ﬁ rst showed each of the photographs and asked the child to name it . If the child named an entity incorrectly , the experimenter corrected the child by saying , for example , “It may look like a [ ﬂ y ] , but it’s actually a [ bee ] . ” At this point , the induction task began . All children completed the induction task across four trials , each trial using a diﬀ erent base , presented in one of three random orders . For each trial , the targets were shuﬄ ed and presented in ran - dom order . To begin , the experimenter showed the ﬁ rst base ( e . g . , a dog ) and said , for example , “Dogs have some stuﬀ inside them , and it is called sacra . Sacra is inside some kinds of things , but it is NOT inside some other kinds of things . ” She then presented each target picture ( e . g . , a bear ) and asked , “Do you think bears have sacra inside like dogs do ? ” 178 F . K . Anggoro et al . / Journal of Cognition and Culture 10 ( 2010 ) 171 – 187 Results and Discussion Table 2 presents the proportion of generalizations from each base to each of the target categories in each language and age group . Notice that generaliza - tions were uniformly high when the base and target were of the same category ( e . g . , from the dog base to other mammal targets ; from the bee base to the other insect targets ) . In contrast , generalizations to non - living things were uniformly low . Th ese indices suggest that children understood the demands of the category - based induction task and were responding systematically . In the analyses that follow , we consider more precisely their patterns of inductive inference . Generalization to Nonhuman Animal Target Categories In the ﬁ rst analysis , we ask whether children’s tendency to generalize a novel property to non - human animal target categories varies as a function of the base on which the property was introduced . We predicted that when a non - human animal serves as the base , English - and Indonesian - speaking children should perform comparably , but when a human serves as the base , English - speaking children should be more likely than their Indonesian - speaking coun - terparts to generalize the novel property to the remaining animal targets . Th is is because for Indonesian - speaking children , but not English - speaking chil - dren , generalizing a novel property from a human to a non - human animal requires crossing a named category boundary .

K . Anggoro et al . / Journal of Cognition and Culture 10 ( 2010 ) 171 – 187 We calculated each child’s tendency to generalize the novel property from each base to each of the non - human animal target categories ( because our goal is to discover children’s tendency to generalize the novel property to animals other than the biological kind on which it was introduced , we excluded from this analysis children’s responses when the target and base were of the same kind ( e . g . , generalization from dog to dog was excluded from the proportion of generalization from dog to mammal ) ) . We submitted these proportions to an ANOVA with language ( 2 : English , Indonesian ) and age ( 2 : 6 years , 9 years ) as between - subject variables , and base ( 4 : Human , Dog , Bird , Bee ) and target category ( 4 : Mammal , Bird , Insect , Fish ) as within - subject variables . Th is analysis revealed the predicted base×language interaction , F 3 , 552 = 2 . 69 , MSE = 0 . 19 , P < 0 . 05 , η p2 = 0 . 01 . Speciﬁ cally , when a human served as the base , English - speaking children were more likely than Indonesian - speaking chil - dren to generalize a novel biological property to non - human animal target categories , F 1 , 186 = 6 . 60 , MSE = 0 . 10 , P < 0 . 05 , η p2 = 0 . 03 , but when a non - human animal served as the base , English - and Indonesian - speaking children per - formed comparably ( F values < 3 . 30 , ns ) . Th e analysis also revealed the anticipated base×target category×age interac - tion , F 9 , 1656 = 2 . 13 , MSE = 0 . 10 , P < 0 . 05 , η p2 = 0 . 01 . We pursued this interaction by examining performance at each age . Consider ﬁ rst the 6 - year - olds . When a human served as the base , English - speaking children were more likely to generalize a novel property to non - human animal target categories ( M = 0 . 46 , SD = 0 . 40 ) than were their Indonesian - speaking counterparts ( M = 0 . 29 , SD = 0 . 37 ) , F 1 , 98 = 7 . 40 , MSE = 0 . 10 , P < 0 . 01 , η p2 = 0 . 07 . Yet when any non - human animal served as a base , English - and Indonesian - speaking children performed com - parably ( F values < 0 . 80 , ns ) . Th is is consistent with the prediction that the distinct naming practices of English and Indonesian have consequences on children’s reasoning , especially when it pertains to the relation between human and non - human animals . Consider next the 9 - year - olds , for whom the diﬀ erence between the two communities is no longer obvious . Th ese children performed comparably whether the base was a human or a non - human animal ( F values < 2 . 20 , ns ) . 3 Th is is consistent with the prediction that , even in the absence of a dedicated name for the category that includes humans and non - human animals , children are able to bring humans and non - human animals into closer correspondence . 3 After the study was completed , we distributed language - background questionnaires and obtained information on about half of the English - speaking children . At each age , there were no diﬀ erences in generalization patterns between English - speaking children whose native language was English versus those whose native language was not English ( F values < 1 . 90 , ns ) . Further analyses revealed that among the Indonesian - speaking 9 - year - olds , private - school children F . K . Anggoro et al . / Journal of Cognition and Culture 10 ( 2010 ) 171 – 187 181 Th is is also consistent with the proposal that children’s biological reasoning is shaped by more than naming practices alone , and that diﬀ erences that likely originated in distinct naming practices become attenuated with experience ( either from biologically - related activities or from exposure to Western - inspired curricula ) . Further support for this interpretation comes from an analysis of children’s generalization to the plant target category . 4 Asymmetries in Generalization Between Humans and Non - human Animals In the next analysis , we test the hypothesis that English - speaking children will show more asymmetric generalization , favoring humans over nonhuman animals as the inductive base , than Indonesian - speaking children . In order to test for this asymmetry , we focused speciﬁ cally on generalizations to the indi - vidual targets that are of the same kind as the bases ( human , dog , bird , bee ) . We calculated each child’s generalizations from the human base to each of the non - human animal targets ( human – dog , human – bird , human – bee ) , and their generalizations from each of the non - human animal bases to the human target ( dog – human , bird – human , bee – human ) . Th ese proportions were submitted to an ANOVA with language ( 2 : English , Indonesian ) and age ( 2 : 6 years , 9 years ) as between subject variables , and base ( 2 : Human base , Non - human base ) and target ( 3 : Dog , Bird , Bee ) as within - subject variables . Th e results are depicted in Figure 2 . Th ere were two signiﬁ cant interactions involving base , both of which shed light on the role of naming practices and experience in shaping children’s reasoning about the relation between human and nonhuman animals . First , the base×language interaction , F 1 , 184 = 8 . 44 , MSE = 0 . 18 , P < 0 . 01 , η p2 = 0 . 04 , indicated that when a human served as the base , English - speaking children ( M = 0 . 47 , SD = 0 . 39 ) were more likely than Indonesian - speaking children ( M = 0 . 36 , SD = 0 . 40 ) to generalize the novel property to a non - human animal , F 1 , 186 = 5 . 64 , MSE = 0 . 11 , P < 0 . 05 , η p2 = 0 . 02 , ( M = 0 . 55 , SD = 0 . 05 ) made more generalizations overall than their public - school counterparts ( M = 0 . 36 , SD = 0 . 06 ) , F 1 , 47 = 5 . 54 , MSE = 1 . 10 , P < 0 . 05 , η p2 = 0 . 11 . However , at each age , there were no diﬀ erences in preference for a human or non - human animal base between private - and public - school children ( F values < 1 . 58 , ns ) . 4 See Table 2 . Th e proportions of generalization from each base to a plant target category were analyzed with an ANOVA using language ( 2 : English , Indonesian ) and age ( 2 : 6 years , 9 years ) as between - subject variables , and base ( 4 : Human , Dog , Bird , Bee ) as a within - subject variable . A main eﬀ ect of age , F 1 , 184 = 4 . 14 , MSE = 0 . 27 , P < 0 . 05 , η p2 = 0 . 02 , indicated that 9 - year - olds ( M = 0 . 20 , SD = 0 . 03 ) were more likely than 6 - year - olds ( M = 0 . 13 , SD = 0 . 02 ) to generalize a novel biological property from a human or a non - human animal to a plant . Th ese results provide further suggestive evidence of the eﬀ ects of formal and informal learning experiences in bringing animals and plants together in closer correspondence as living things . 182 F .

Th is is consistent with the hypothesis that for Indo - nesian - speaking children , but not English - speaking children , extending a novel property from a human to a non - human animal requires crossing a named category boundary . Second , the analysis showed a base×age interac - tion , F 1 , 184 = 10 . 41 , MSE = 0 . 18 , P < 0 . 01 , η p 2 = 0 . 05 . As predicted , when a human served as the base , 9 - year - olds ( M = 0 . 46 , SD = 0 . 39 ) were more likely to gener - alize a novel property to a non - human animal than were 6 - year - olds ( M = 0 . 37 , SD = 0 . 41 ) ( although the eﬀ ect was marginal ) , F 1 , 186 = 3 . 35 , MSE = 0 . 11 , P = 0 . 07 , η p2 = 0 . 01 , but when a non - human animal served as the base , there was no dif - ference between the age groups in generalizations to a human target ( M 6 = 0 . 23 , SD = 0 . 35 ; M 9 = 0 . 17 , SD = 0 . 27 ) , F 1 , 186 = 1 . 71 , MSE = 0 . 11 , ns , η p2 = 0 . 01 . Th at is , we observed asymmetries favoring humans as the inductive base in every group except the 6 - year - old Indonesian - speaking children . 5 Th ese results are consistent with the prediction that diﬀ erences attributable to naming are stronger in young children , and that with additional experience ( such as biologically - relevant activities or exposure to Western science curri - cula ) , humans and non - human animals come into close correspondence , even in Indonesian - speaking children for whom this correspondence is not lexical - ized . Th is correspondence strengthens the animate or animal inclusive category , resulting in more asymmetric generalizations favoring humans as the induc - tive base among older Indonesian - speaking children . Further Evidence : Order Eﬀ ects We interpret these results as evidence that when English - and older Indone - sian - speaking children are introduced to a novel property on a human base and asked to generalize to a particular non - human animal target , their access to the animal inclusive category results in asymmetries favoring humans . If this 5 Further analyses revealed that at age 6 , private - school children generalized more from a human to a non - human animal ( M = 0 . 28 , SD = 0 . 38 ) than from a non - human animal to a human ( M = 0 . 21 , SD = 0 . 33 ) ( although this eﬀ ect was marginal ) , F 1 , 33 = 3 . 85 , MSE = 0 . 08 , P = 0 . 06 , η p2 = 0 . 11 , but public - school children did not show this asymmetric tendency ( F < 2 . 21 , ns ) . In Indonesia , private - school children are taught English earlier ( starting in 1st grade ) than public - school children ( starting in 2nd grade ) . Th us , the 6 - year - olds in our sample either have not or are just starting to learn English in school . We suspect that a more likely contributor to this diﬀ erence is that private - school children come from families of higher socioeconomic status than public - school children . As such , private - school children may be more exposed to biologically - enriching activities ( such as going to zoos , aquaria , etc . ) that might help bring humans and non - human animals into closer correspondence earlier on . 184 F . K . Anggoro et al . / Journal of Cognition and Culture 10 ( 2010 ) 171 – 187 is the case , then perhaps the salience of this category will inﬂ uence perfor - mance on subsequent trials . If on the child’s ﬁ rst trial , a human happens to serve as the base , then their use of the animal inclusive category could carry over to subsequent trials when a human serves as the target . But if on the child’s ﬁ rst trial a non - human animal happens to serve as the base , then their use of the animal contrastive category could carry over to subsequent trials . Analyses of order eﬀ ects revealed that when a human serves as the base in their ﬁ rst trial , English - speaking 6 - and 9 - year - olds and Indonesian - speaking 9 - year - olds generalized strongly from a human to non - human animals ( overall M = 0 . 67 , SD = 0 . 35 ) , but when the human base was introduced later in subse - quent trials ( after a human had served as a target ) , they were much less likely to do so ( overall M = 0 . 37 , SD = 0 . 37 ) ( F values > 5 . 80 , P values < 0 . 05 , η p2 values > 0 . 13 ) . Th at is , for these groups of children – all of whom showed the asymmetries in the previous analysis – the human – non - human animal asym - metries are stronger if a human serves as the initial base . Summary and Conclusions In the current study we asked whether and how children’s reasoning about biological entities – in particular their reasoning about the relation between humans and non - human animals – is mediated by the naming practices of their language community . Th e evidence reported here indicates that young children’s reasoning about this biological relation is inﬂ uenced by naming practices . It also suggests that this inﬂ uence is attenuated over development , an outcome that is consistent with the view that children’s biological reasoning is inﬂ uenced by factors other than language alone . When a novel biological property was introduced on a non - human animal , children in both language communities performed comparably , systematically extending that property to other non - human animals . But when the property was introduced on a human , cross - linguistic and developmental diﬀ erences emerged . First , English - speaking 6 - year - olds were more likely than their Indo - nesian - speaking counterparts to generalize the novel property and , therefore , to exhibit asymmetries favoring humans over non - human animals . Second , the diﬀ erence between English - and Indonesian - speaking children , evident in 6 - year - olds , was virtually absent in 9 - year - olds . What might account for these ﬁ ndings ? To answer this question , we appeal not only to the intriguing diﬀ erences in naming practices between English and Indonesian , but also to the inﬂ uence of learning experiences in both for - mal and informal settings . F . K . Anggoro et al . / Journal of Cognition and Culture 10 ( 2010 ) 171 – 187 185 Although the US and Indonesian children in the current study spoke diﬀ er - ent languages , in many other ways , their experiences were comparable . Th ey all lived in urban communities and attended schools that had adopted a West - ern science curriculum , and their families were comparable in relative socio - economic status and religious aﬃ liation . We interpret the cross - linguistic diﬀ erences at age 6 as reﬂ ections of diﬀ erences in the naming practices for biological concepts , especially animal . Th e developmental diﬀ erence – in which Indonesian - speaking children’s induction patterns become more asymmetric and more closely aligned with those of their English - speaking counterparts – likely reﬂ ects the inﬂ uence of learning experiences beyond community - wide naming practices alone . For example , as Indonesian - speaking children are exposed to Western science - based curricula in biology , they receive explicit information about the correspondences between humans and non - human animals , and as a result , the animal inclusive category becomes available for rea - soning about biological properties . Of course , the children in Jakarta are exposed not only to a Western curriculum , but also to Western - inspired media , including stories , cartoons , and movies that adopt an anthropocentric model of non - human animals ( Herrmann et al . , under review ) . Together , these inﬂ u - ences from formal and informal environments likely highlight the animate ( animal inclusive ) category and support its inductive potential . Th is outcome is consistent with other recent evidence that community - wide inﬂ uences have their strongest eﬀ ects in young children , and become attenuated over development . Waxman et al . ( 2007 ) examined European American and Native American ( Menominee ) children and adults’ intuitions about property inheritance and the mechanisms underlying the transmission of kindhood . Menominee tribal membership is based on blood quantum , and blood quantum measures have signiﬁ cant consequences for important activi - ties such as hunting and ﬁ shing . Th us , there is a great deal of community - wide discourse about blood quantum in the Menominee population . Waxman et al . found that unlike the youngest European American children who strongly favored the birth parent in the face of a blood transfusion , the youngest Menominee children strongly favored the adoptive parent . Th at is , Menomi - nee 5 - to 6 - year - olds believed that kindhood is determined by the sharing of blood – a belief consistent with the discourse emphasis on blood quantum in their community . Interestingly , this diﬀ erence between the Menominee and European American children was attenuated with age , and disappeared by age 9 to 10 ( Waxman et al . , 2007 ) . In closing , the work reported here provides a window into the way in which children’s experiences shape their reasoning about the biological world . We suspect that early in development and in advance of considerable additional 186 F . K . Anggoro et al . / Journal of Cognition and Culture 10 ( 2010 ) 171 – 187 biology - relevant experience , children’s biological induction may be quite sen - sitive to the ways in which biological categories are named , but that with additional experience , the inﬂ uence of naming is attenuated . In future work , it will be important to pursue more closely the interaction between naming practices and these learning experiences .
