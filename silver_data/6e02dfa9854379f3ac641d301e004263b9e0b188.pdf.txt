Hodson , 1 Daniela A . Sahlender , 1 and Margaret S . Robinson 1 , * 1 University of Cambridge , Cambridge Institute for Medical Research , Cambridge CB2 0XY , UK Summary Although adaptor protein complex 1 ( AP - 1 ) and Golgi - local - ized , g ear - containing , ADP - ribosylation factor - binding proteins ( GGAs ) are both adaptors for clathrin - mediated intracellular trafﬁcking , the pathways they mediate and their relationship to each other remain open questions [ 1 ] . To tease apart the functions of AP - 1 and GGAs , we rapidly inac - tivated each adaptor using the ‘‘knocksideways’’ system [ 2 ] and then compared the protein composition of clathrin - coated vesicle ( CCV ) fractions from control and knockside - ways cells . The AP - 1 knocksideways resulted in a dramatic and unexpected loss of GGA2 from CCVs . Over 30 other peripheral membrane proteins and over 30 transmembrane proteins were also depleted , including several mutated in genetic disorders , indicating that AP - 1 acts as a linchpin for intracellular CCV formation . In contrast , the GGA2 knock - sideways affected only lysosomal hydrolases and their receptors . We propose thatthere are at least two populations of intracellular CCVs : one containing both GGAs and AP - 1 for anterograde trafﬁcking and another containing AP - 1 for retrograde trafﬁcking . Our study shows that knocksideways and proteomics are a powerful combination for investigating protein function , which can potentially be used on many different types of proteins . Results and Discussion Rerouting of AP - 1 and GGA Adaptors to Mitochondria The clathrin adaptor AP - 1 ( adaptor protein complex 1 ) is expressed in all eukaryotes and has been implicated in path - ways as diverse as sorting of lysosomal hydrolases and / or their receptors in mammals [ 3 , 4 ] , protein trafﬁcking to olfac - tory cilia in C . elegans [ 5 ] , biogenesis of rhoptry organelles in Toxoplasma [ 6 ] , formation of contractile vacuoles in Dic - tyostelium [ 7 ] , and protein localization to the trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) in yeast [ 8 ] . However , exactly what AP - 1 is doing is still unclear , including whether it facilitates anterograde trafﬁcking , retrograde trafﬁcking , or both . Its relationship to the GGA ( Golgi - localized , g ear - containing , ADP - ribosylation factor - binding ) family of adaptors is also a topic of much speculation [ 9 – 11 ] . Although knockdowns and knockouts have provided some insights into AP - 1 and GGA function , they have also yielded conﬂicting results [ 3 , 4 , 8 , 9 , 11 ] and / or surprisingly subtle phenotypes [ 10 , 12 ] . This is most likely because knockdowns and knockouts take a long time , during which the cell can adjust to the gradual loss of the protein of interest by switching on compensatory pathways . We recently developed a technique called a ‘‘knockside - ways’’ to circumvent the problem of gradual protein loss [ 2 ] . The knocksideways technique involves tagging a protein of interest with an FKBP domain , making it siRNA ( small inter - fering RNA ) resistant , and then coexpressing it with a protein called Mitotrap , which is tagged with an FKBP - rapamycin - binding domain and anchored into the mitochondrial outer membrane . The endogenous protein of interest is knocked down with siRNA , and rapamycin is added to the cells . Rapamycin sequesters the protein of interest onto mitochon - dria by causing it to form heterodimers with Mitotrap , thus depleting it from the available cytosolic pool ( Figure 1A ) . In the case of AP - 1 , rerouting to mitochondria is essentially com - plete by 10 min , so the knocksideways is w 500 times faster than a conventional knockdown [ 2 ] . To investigate the effect of the AP - 1 knocksideways on some of AP - 1’s binding partners , we ﬁrst carried out western blots on isolated clathrin - coated vesicles ( CCVs ) . Addition of rapamycin for 10 min caused g - FKBP to be strongly depleted from CCVs , similar to endogenous g in a conventional AP - 1 knockdown ( Figures 1B and 1C , left ) . However , the conven - tional knockdown had a relatively weak effect on the AP - 1 accessory proteins aftiphilin and g - synergin and no apparent effect on epsinR . In contrast , all three of these proteins were substantially depleted from CCVs isolated from AP - 1 knocksi - deways cells , and we also saw a partial loss of clathrin , as previously reported [ 2 ] ( Figure 1C ; see Figure S1 available online ) . Most unexpectedly , we found that GGA2 ( one of three GGAs in mammals and the only one detectable in isolated HeLa cell CCVs by either western blotting or mass spectrom - etry ) was strongly depleted , even though GGA2 did not follow AP - 1 onto mitochondria ( Figure 1B , left ) . In contrast , in a conventional AP - 1 knockdown , the amount of GGA2 in the CCV fraction was unaffected ( see also [ 10 ] ) . Thus , the knocksi - deways is much more effective than a knockdown at revealing which proteins normally depend upon AP - 1 for their incorpora - tion into CCVs , and it uncovers an unexpected relationship between AP - 1 and GGA2 . To tease apart the roles of AP - 1 and GGAs , we made a second cell line coexpressing Mitotrap and a siRNA - resistant GGA2 - FKBP construct ( Figures 1A and 1B , right ) . Because the mammalian GGAs are thought to be at least partially redun - dant [ 13 – 15 ] , all three endogenous GGAs were depleted with siRNA . Addition of rapamycin for 10 min caused the GGA2 - FKBP to become rerouted to mitochondria and lost from iso - lated CCVs ( Figures 1B and 1C ) . However , western blotting did not show a concomitant loss of any other coat components from the CCV fraction . Taken together , the AP - 1 and GGA2 knocksideways phenotypes indicate that GGA2 depends on AP - 1 for incorporation into CCVs , but not vice versa . Proﬁling of CCVs from AP - 1 and GGA Knocksideways Cells To look for changes in the overall protein composition of CCVs in cells with either AP - 1 or GGA2 rerouted to mitochondria , we used SILAC ( stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell * Correspondence : jh228 @ cam . ac . uk ( J . H . ) , msr12 @ mole . bio . cam . ac . uk ( M . S . R . ) Current Biology 22 , 1711 – 1716 , September 25 , 2012 ª 2012 Elsevier Ltd . Open access under CC BY license . http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . cub . 2012 . 07 . 012 culture ) followed by mass spectrometry . Endogenous AP - 1 or GGAs were depleted using siRNA , and the SILAC - labeled cells were treated for 10 min with rapamycin before the initial homogenization step . CCV fractions were prepared from cells treated both with and without rapamycin , and the relative abundance of each protein was quantiﬁed ( Table S1 ) . Figure 2 shows that 99 proteins were reduced 2 - fold or more in the AP - 1 knocksideways , compared with only 29 proteins in the GGA2 knocksideways . In addition , the AP - 1 and GGA knocksideways had strikingly different effects on different types of proteins . In the AP - 1 knocksideways , the most strongly depleted proteins were mainly other coat compo - nents or accessory factors . These include GGA2 , which was depleted 5 . 6 - fold in the AP - 1 knocksideways . A total of 37 transmembrane proteins were robustly affected , including 8 SNAREs ( soluble N - ethylmaleimide - sensitive factor - activating Figure 1 .

The conventional clathrin knockdown caused a dramatic loss of other coat components ; the AP - 1 knockdown had a weaker effect on aftiphilin and g - synergin , and no effect at all on epsinR , clathrin , or GGA2 ; and the AP - 1 knocksideways caused all of these coat proteins to be depleted . The GGA2 knocksideways caused GGA2 itself to be lost from CCVs , but other coat proteins were unaffected . See also Figure S1 . protein receptors ) , and 7 lysosomal hydrolases were also depleted . In the GGA2 knocksideways CCV fraction , only one other known acces - sory protein was signiﬁcantly lost : rabaptin - 5 ( RABEP1 ) , which interacts with both the appendage and the GAT domain of GGAs [ 16 ] . Hydrolases and other lysosomal lumen proteins ( e . g . , progranulin ) were the major class of affected proteins , with 16 showing los - ses of 2 - fold or more . Only three trans - membrane proteins were depleted 2 - fold or more , and these were the three hydrolase receptors : the cation - inde - pendent and cation - dependent man - nose 6 - phosphate receptors ( IGF2R and M6PR ) and sortilin ( SORT1 ) . Hydrolases and Their Receptors To compare the effects of the AP - 1 and GGA2 knocksideways on different types of proteins , we plotted the average depletion in the AP - 1 knocksideways divided by the average depletion in the GGA2 knocksideways . Figure 3A shows these data for the adaptors themselves , for all of the hydrolases and / or lyso - somal lumen proteins that were depleted at least 2 - fold , for the three hydrolase receptors , and for all of the SNAREs that were depleted at least 2 - fold . The hydrolases stand out as the only proteins , other than GGA2 itself , that were at least as strongly depleted in the GGA2 knocksideways as in the AP - 1 knocksideways . This result indicates that the principal function of GGA2 in HeLa cells is to trafﬁc hydrolase - receptor complexes in the anterograde direction . The role of AP - 1 in hydrolase trafﬁcking is more difﬁcult to dissect . The hydrolases were depleted nearly as strongly in the AP - 1 knocksideways as in the GGA2 knocksideways ( Figures 3A and 3B ) ; however , because the AP - 1 knockside - ways also depleted GGA2 , it seems likely that hydrolases are trafﬁcked mainly ( if not entirely ) by GGAs . In contrast , whereas Current Biology Vol 22 No 18 1712 the GGA2 knocksideways depleted hydrolases and their receptors equally strongly , the AP - 1 knocksideways depleted the receptors signiﬁcantly more than the hydrolases ( Fig - ure 3B ) . This indicates that some of the AP - 1 is involved in the trafﬁcking of ligand - free receptors , most likely in the retro - grade direction . Coat Components and Accessory Factors Other proteins affected by the AP - 1 and / or GGA2 knockside - ways include a number of peripheral membrane proteins that have been shown to bind in vitro to the g and / or GGA C - terminal appendage domains , as well as other peripheral membrane proteins predicted to be novel CCV components [ 17 ] ( Table S1 ) . Among the most strongly affected peripheral membrane proteins were Rab4a and Rab4b . Historically , Rab4 is thought to be endosome associated and AP - 1 to be TGN associated , but it is now clear that the two organelles are closely interlinked , both structurally and functionally , and often difﬁcult to distinguish from each other . Indeed , a recent study proposed that in plant cells the TGN doubles as an early endosomal compartment , and the same may be true for animal cells [ 18 ] . Another small guanosine triphosphatase , ADP - ribosylation factor 1 ( ARF1 ) , which facilitates both AP - 1 and GGA recruitment onto membranes , was also depleted in AP - 1 knocksideways CCVs , as were exchange factors for both Rab4 ( RABGEF1 ) and ARF1 ( ARFGEF2 ) . Figure 2 . Proteomics of CCVs from SILAC - Labeled Knocksideways Cells The fold change ( control : knocksideways ) was calculated for each protein , and proteins were ranked from the highest to lowest ratio . Proteins with ratios of 2 . 0 or higher are shown in order of rank for both the AP - 1 and GGA knocksideways , with color coding for those that were previously identiﬁed as likely coat / accessory proteins , and for transmembrane and lysosomal lumen proteins . Proteins marked with a double asterisk were identiﬁed as likely CCV components by proteomics for the ﬁrst time in the present study ; those marked with a single asterisk were identiﬁed as likely CCV components in our recent proﬁling study [ 17 ] , but not in previous pro - teomics studies . The most striking difference between the AP - 1 and GGA knocksideways is the preponderance of lysosomal hydrolases in the GGA2 knocksideways , whereas the AP - 1 knocksideways affected a wide range of proteins . See also Table S1 . Figure 3 .

See also Figure S2 . Distinct and Overlapping Roles for AP - 1 and GGAs 1713 Integral Membrane Proteins Although the only integral membrane proteins depleted 2 - fold or more by the GGA2 knocksideways were the three hydrolase receptors , the AP - 1 knocksideways had strong effects on 37 different integral membrane proteins , including carboxypepti - dase D and furin , two proteases that cycle between the TGN and endosomes using acidic clusters as sorting signals . PACS - 1 ( phosphofurin acidic cluster - sorting protein 1 ) has been proposed to link acidic cluster - containing proteins to AP - 1 [ 19 ] ; however , we found only trace amounts of PACS - 1 in our CCV fraction , and it did not change in the AP - 1 knocksi - deways , indicating that PACS - 1 is unlikely to be the acidic cluster adaptor . The largest group of integral membrane proteins to be affected by the AP - 1 knocksideways was the SNARE family . SNAREs are essential vesicle cargo proteins , because without them vesicles would be unable to fuse with their targets , but with the exception of VAMP4 ( vesicle - associated membrane protein 4 ) , which has a dileucine motif that binds to AP - 1 [ 20 ] , most SNAREs lack conventional sorting signals . VAMP4 was the only R - SNARE to be robustly affected , but several Q - SNAREs were depleted , including syntaxins 16 , 10 , 8 , 6 , and 12 , and Vti1 a and b . Vti1b has been shown to use a folded domain to interact with epsinR / clathrin interactor 1 [ 21 ] , an AP - 1 - associated protein that was also strongly affected by the knocksideways . Whether the other SNAREs can bind directly to AP - 1 or another coat protein or whether they bind indirectly via VAMP4 and / or Vti1b remains to be determined . Other strongly depleted transmembrane proteins include several that are mutated in human genetic disorders ( http : / / omim . org ) . KIAA0319L and NAGPA , two proteins that trafﬁc in a clathrin - dependent manner , have been implicated in dyslexia and persistent stuttering , respectively [ 22 – 24 ] , whereas the copper - transporting ATPases ( adenosine tri - phosphatases ) , ATP7A and ATP7B , are mutated in two dis - orders of copper metabolism , Menkes disease and Wilson disease . Under normal conditions , the two copper - ATPases are found mainly in the TGN , but they translocate to the plasma membrane in response to high copper levels , and both have dileucine motifs that contribute to their TGN localization [ 25 ] . To investigate how the AP - 1 knocksideways affects the steady - state distribution of some of the CCV cargo proteins , we mixed together control and knocksideways cells , then treated the cells with rapamycin for 1 hr . Immunoﬂuorescence revealed that in the control cells , KIAA0319L , syntaxin 16 , syn - taxin 10 , and ATP7A all had a juxtanuclear pattern , colocalizing strongly with the TGN marker TGN46 ( Figures 4A ; Figure S3 ; see also [ 26 ] ) . However , the knocksideways caused this pattern to become more diffuse and to spread out toward the cell periphery , similar to what we showed for the cation - independent mannose 6 - phosphate receptor ( CIMPR ) in our previous knocksideways study [ 2 ] . This ﬁnding provides further support for a role for AP - 1 in retrograde trafﬁcking back to the TGN . Because the trafﬁcking of ATP7A and ATP7B is regulated by copper levels , we investigated whether copper affects the packaging of the two ATPases into CCVs . Cells were incubated for either 10 min or 1 hr in normal or high - copper medium , then CCV fractions were prepared . Even after 10 min , the high copper caused a striking depletion of both ATP7A and ATP7B from CCVs ( Figure 4B ) . These observa - tions , together with the knocksideways data , suggest that normally AP - 1 continually retrieves ATP7A and ATP7B back to the TGN but that high copper levels prevent the two Figure 4 . Sorting of Selected Cargo Proteins ( A ) CellsexpressingeitherFKBP - taggedAP - 1 g aloneorFKBP - taggedAP - 1 g plus Mitotrap were mixed together , depleted of endogenous AP - 1 g , and treated with rapamycin for 1 hr , then double labeled for immunoﬂuores - cence . In the Mitotrap - expressing cells ( asterisks ) , rapamycin caused the cargo protein labeling to become more diffuse and peripheral . Scale bar represents 20 m m . See also Figure S3 . ( B ) CCV fractions were prepared from cells incubated in either normal medium or in medium containing 189 m M copper ( Cu ) . Both copper - ATPases are lost from the CCV fraction as early as 10 min after copper addition . Current Biology Vol 22 No 18 1714 copper - ATPases from interacting with AP - 1 , possibly by inducing a conformational change that masks their dileucine sorting signals . Conclusions By combining the knocksideways technique with CCV proﬁling , we have been able to gain unprecedented insights into the functional relationship between AP - 1 and GGAs . Our results indicate that AP - 1 acts as a linchpin in the formation of intracellular CCVs , and that if AP - 1 is acutely lost , these vesicles cannot form . Unexpectedly , one of the CCV compo - nents that was most strongly dependent on AP - 1 was GGA2 . This result challenges the conclusions of a recent study carried out on yeast , which proposed that GGAs and AP - 1 nucleate the formation of different populations of CCVs [ 11 ] , but it is consistent with immunoelectron microscopy studies showing that at least some clathrin - coated - budding proﬁles are posi - tive for both AP - 1 and GGAs [ 9 , 10 ] . Putting all of the available data together , our new results , together with reports in the literature , are most consistent with a role for AP - 1 in bidirectional trafﬁcking . We propose that GGAs act together with AP - 1 to transport hydrolase - receptor complexes in the anterograde direction , from a juxta - nuclear TGN / post - TGN compartment to a more peripheral endosomal compartment , where the hydrolases dissociate . We also propose that AP - 1 has a second role in retrieving ligand - free receptors , together with proteins like KIAA0319L , ATP7A and ATP7B , and various SNAREs , from the peripheral endosomal compartment back to the juxtanuclear TGN / post - TGN compartment . Further evidence supporting a role for AP - 1 in endosome - to - TGN trafﬁcking comes from the ﬁnding that endocytosed anti - CIMPR remains in a peripheral com - partment in AP - 1 knocksideways cells but moves to a juxtanuclear compartment in controls [ 2 ] . In addition , immuno - localization studies have shown that GGAs are mainly associ - ated with the TGN , whereas much of the AP - 1 is associated with tubular endosomes [ 27 , 28 ] . Why the two adaptors localize , at least in part , to different compartments is not clear , but differences in the molecular makeup of the compartments ( e . g . , ARF concentration , phosphoinositide composition ) pro - bably contribute . From the present study , we can conclude that the AP - 1 pathway ( although not necessarily AP - 1 itself ) sorts a variety of biologically important transmembrane and lumenal pro - teins . These include not only hydrolases and their receptors but also multiple SNAREs and a number of proteins that are mutated in human genetic disorders . In the case of ATP7A and ATP7B , AP - 1 - mediated trafﬁcking is probably essential for normal function , and it will be important to determine whether the same is true for other cargo proteins . Whereas the AP - 1 knocksideways produced global effects on intracellular CCVs , the GGA2 knocksideways affected only a single accessory protein , the three hydrolase receptors , and a range of hydrolases and other proteins residing in the lysosomal lumen . This indicates that the major role of GGA2 in HeLa cells is to transport lysosomal proteins in the antero - grade direction . Other GGAs may be more important for traf - ﬁcking of other types of cargo , such as ubiquitinated proteins [ 29 ] , especially because GGA2 cannot completely compen - sate for loss of GGA1 / GGA3 in knockout mice [ 15 ] . Although the GGAs have been relatively well characterized , we still know virtually nothing about the functions of most of the other peripheral membrane proteins associated with intra - cellular CCVs . However , by analogy with endocytic CCVs , we suspect that many of them will turn out to be alternative adap - tors for cargo proteins whose sorting signals cannot bind directly to AP - 1 . By extending the knocksideways approach to some of the CCV ‘‘accessory factors , ’’ we hope to be able to assign functions to proteins that until now have remained elusive .
