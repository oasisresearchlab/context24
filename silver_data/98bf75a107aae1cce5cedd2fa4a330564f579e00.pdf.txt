Pediatric COVID - 19 only accounted for a minority of household transmission . 2 . Lower household COVID - 19 transmissibility was shown in children than adults . 3 . Younger children were as susceptible as the older in household COVID - 19 . 4 . Increased household transmissibility was observed in children with new variants . 5 . Children seemed as susceptible as adults in households with new variants . Abstract Background : Household is potentially the highest - risk exposure setting of SARS - COV - 2 transmission , in which the role of children has remained controversial . Methods : Through retrieval in PubMed and EMBASE , studies were included in two parts : meta - analysis of the household secondary attack 3 rate ( SAR ) and case analysis of household pediatric infections . Results : A total of 95 articles were included : 48 for meta - analysis and 47 for case analysis . Pediatric COVID - 19 only comprised a minority of the household transmission . The total pooled household SAR of child index cases and contacts were 0 . 20 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 15 - 0 . 26 ) and 0 . 24 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 18 - 0 . 30 ) . Lower household transmissibility was reported in both child index cases and contacts compared to adults ( RR = 0 . 64 , 95 % CI : 0 . 50 - 0 . 81 ; RR = 0 . 74 , 95 % CI : 0 . 64 - 0 . 85 ) . Younger children were as susceptible as the older children ( RR = 0 . 89 , 95 % CI : 0 . 72 - 1 . 10 ) . Through subgroup analyses of different variants and periods , increased household SAR was observed in children ( Wild : 0 . 20 ; Alpha : 0 . 42 ; Delta : 0 . 35 ; Omicron : 0 . 56 ) and no significant difference was found in household SAR between children and adults when new variants dominated . Conclusions : Although children were demonstrated not to be dominant in the household transmission , their transmissibility of SARS - CoV - 2 appeared on the rise as new variants emerge . Key words : COVID - 19 , SARS - CoV - 2 , Household transmission , Child . 1 . Introduction As of 29 April 2022 , there have been 510 . 2 million confirmed COVID - 19 cases and 6 . 2 million confirmed deaths globally , and people 4 around the world are still suffering from the fourth wave of the pandemic caused by the Omicron variant of SARS - CoV - 2 ( WHO COVID - 19 Dashboard Data , 2022 ) . For outbreak control , breaking the chain of virus transmission is generally considered to be one of the most effective strategies besides vaccination . Previous studies have suggested that the household is potentially the highest - risk exposure setting of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission , which may have led to a steep escalation of COVID - 19 cases even after the policy of national lockdowns and extreme social - distancing norms in many countries ( Chakrabarti , et al . , 2020 ; Coccia , 2020 ; Lewis , et al . , 2021 ) . Children often play an important role in the transmission of some respiratory infectious diseases , such as influenza and measles ( García‐Salido , 2020 ; Viner , et al . , 2020 ; Yang , 2020 ) . But for SARS - CoV - 2 , it remains controversial ( García‐Salido , 2020 ; Goldstein , et al . , 2021 ; Lau , et al . , 2020 ; Lee , Raszka , 2020 ) . Pediatric infections only comprise a small proportion of total reported cases and children are usually reported with a lower infection rate and a milder clinical course compared to adult cases ( Dong , et al . , 2020 ; Hoang , et al . , 2020 ; Irfan , et al . , 2021 ; Ye , et al . , 2020 ) . However , exactly frequently being asymptomatic carriers , children may represent an essential chain of viral transmission and be responsible for the continuous spread of the virus ( de Souza , et al . , 2020 ; Irfan , et al . , 2021 ) . With the emergence of some new virus variants , such as Delta and Omicron , increased transmissibility of SARS - CoV - 2 in children has been reported by many studies ( Chun , et al . , 2022 ; Cloete , et al . , 2022 ; Elliott , et al . , 5 2022 ; Marks , et al . , 2022 ; Thelwall , et al . , 2022 ) . What’s worse , while vaccinations for adults are ongoing , there is still a vacuum in children , especially for those under 12 ( Walter , et al . , 2022 ) , which also may be an important reason for the viral transmission ( Li , et al . , 2022 ) . Therefore , understanding of the role of children in the household transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 is still evolving , a further analysis is necessary . This study aims to ( 1 ) assess the prevalence of pediatric COVID - 19 in family clusters ; ( 2 ) estimate the household secondary attack rate of children in different periods and variants ; ( 3 ) compare the transmissibility of SARS - CoV - 2 in different age groups and explore its potential determinants . 2 . Methods This systematic review and meta - analysis were conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta - Analyses ( PRISMA ) guidelines and the protocol was registered on PROSPERO ( CRD42022313960 ) . 2 . 1 . Definition A household transmission cluster was defined as a group of ≥2 confirmed COVID - 19 cases in cohabiting individuals where the diagnosis of 6 cases occurred within 2 weeks of each other . The index case , the primary case , was defined as the first person in households to be infected with SARS - CoV - 2 . Household contacts were defined as family members or close relatives who had unprotected contact with the index case but did not necessarily live together . The transmissibility of SARS - CoV - 2 was empirically estimated by the secondary attack rate . The household secondary attack rate ( SAR ) was defined as the number of household secondary cases divided by total household contacts . Children were individuals < 18 . Notably , as for studies dividing the age groups by 10 years , individuals of 10 - 19 years old were included in the child group . 2 . 2 . Search Strategy and Eligibility Criteria A systematic retrieval was performed on two databases ( PubMed and EMBASE ) from inception to 20 April , 2022 , using the key search terms : COVID - 19 , SARS - CoV - 2 , family characteristics , household transmission , and so on [ details in Table S1 ] , with no restriction on the language , date , study type or place of publication . Non - primary documents and modeling studies were excluded . Depending on the study type and provided data , studies were included in two parts : case analyses of household pediatric infections and meta - analysis on the household SAR . Case analyses mainly included case reports focusing on individual household transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 . The personal information of index cases , household contacts , family relationships , and the disease progression of COVID - 19 7 cases must be provided . While the SAR meta - analysis mainly included descriptive studies that had reported the household SARS - CoV - 2 secondary attack rate in different age groups : at least two of the following were required : household contacts , household secondary cases , and SAR . Studies with insufficient data or possible duplicate cases were excluded . 2 . 2 . Data Extraction and Quality Assessment Two authors ( Tian and Zhang ) independently extracted the following information from each included study : author , country , study type , study period , case definitions , testing protocol , contact - tracing methods , demographic characteristic , COVID - 19 data ( exposures , index cases , household contacts , secondary infection cases , SAR ) , potential factors , and so on . Disagreements were resolved through consultation with the third author ( Chen ) . To critically appraise the methodological quality of included studies , the JBI critical appraisal checklist was applied ( Critical Appraisal Tools JBI , 2022 ) . Each included study was scored independently by two authors ( Tian and Zhang ) and given an average point . Studies were ranked as high quality if they were scored > = 10 , medium if they were scored > = 7 - 9 , and low if they were scored < 7 . 2 . 3 . Data Analysis 8 All analyses were performed using R 4 . 1 . 2 software . The secondary attack rate ( SAR ) and its relative risk ( RR ) were calculated for each study . SARs were pooled with a random intercept logistic regression model after a Freeman - Tukey double arcsine transformation and RRs were pooled using a random - effects model with Der - Simonian and Laird weights . The within - study variation was estimated with the 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) and the Higgin’s and Thompsons’ I 2 was used to assess heterogeneity between studies . Subgroup analyses were conducted to explore the source of heterogeneity . Publication bias was detected through performing funnel plot and Egger’s test . P < 0 . 05 was considered statistically significant in all tests . 3 . Results As shown in the flow diagram in Figure S1 , a total of 1632 records were identified through the data search and 236 articles were retrieved for full - text assessment . Finally , 95 articles were included in our analysis : 48 articles for household SAR meta - analysis and 47 articles for case analysis . Studies included in SAR meta - analysis was demonstrated in Table 1 , of which 26 / 48 were of high quality and 22 / 48 were of medium quality according to the quality assessment in Table S2 , and the full details of family clusters included in case analyses were shown in Table S3 . All included studies reported household COVID - 19 from 18 countries and regions with a total of 1153693 participants ( 834613 adults and 9 319080 children ) . 3 . 1 Case Analyses of Household Pediatric COVID - 19 In the case analysis of pediatric COVID - 19 , 47 articles were included , identifying 78 household transmission clusters . As shown in Table 2 , only 10 . 3 % ( 8 / 78 ) familial clusters were identified with a pediatric index case . These pediatric index cases only led to 7 . 7 % ( 16 / 207 ) of all secondary cases , compared with the 92 . 3 % of secondary cases caused by the adult index cases . Child contacts were identified as 29 . 8 % ( 84 / 282 ) of all household contacts and reported in 60 . 3 % ( 47 / 78 ) familial clusters . The child secondary infections only accounted for 30 % ( 62 / 207 ) of all secondary infections , compared with the 70 % as adults . 3 . 2 Meta - analyses on household SAR of SARS - COV - 2 3 . 2 . 1 Household SAR of Child Contacts Secondary infections of the pediatric household contacts were identified in 41 studies and the pooled SAR was 0 . 24 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 18 - 0 . 30 , I 2 = 100 % ) [ Figure 1 ] . Publication bias was reported upon examination of a funnel plot ( Egger Test , P = 0 . 021 ) [ Figure S2 ] . 10 Subgroup analyses on household SAR of child contacts were performed on research periods and SARS - CoV - 2 variants in Table 3 . In different research periods , 31 studies were carried out between 2019 and February 2021 and the SAR was estimated at 0 . 18 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 13 - 0 . 25 , I 2 = 99 % ) . 9 studies were conducted between February and November 2021 and the SAR was 0 . 39 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 30 - 0 . 48 , I 2 = 97 % ) . The SAR of 2 studies between November 2021 and 2022 was 0 . 51 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 47 - 0 . 54 , I 2 = 0 % ) . Significant difference in SAR was reported in different groups of research period ( P < 0 . 01 ) . For different SARS - CoV - 2 variants , the SAR of Wild type in 33 included studies was 0 . 20 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 14 - 0 . 26 , I 2 = 99 % ) . The SAR of Alpha in 3 included studies was 0 . 42 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 23 - 0 . 62 , I 2 = 94 % ) . The Delta variant was investigated in 5 studies and the SAR was 0 . 35 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 25 - 0 . 45 , I 2 = 98 % ) . The SAR of Omicron in 2 studies was 0 . 56 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 51 - 0 . 61 , I 2 = 20 % ) . Significant difference in SAR was also reported in different variants ( P < 0 . 01 ) . Analyses on household SAR of child contacts in different age groups , children < 10 years were found less susceptible compared with children > 10 ( RR = 0 . 74 , 95 % CI : 0 . 56 - 0 . 97 , I 2 = 0 % ) . However , no significant difference was shown between children < 12 and > 12 ( RR = 1 . 12 , 95 % CI : 0 . 90 - 1 . 39 , I 2 = 77 % ) . Combined analysis on the above two cases , the younger child contacts were not significantly associated with a lower SAR than the older ones ( RR = 1 . 01 , 95 % CI : 0 . 84 - 1 . 21 , I 2 = 66 % ) [ Figure 2 ] . 11 3 . 2 . 2 Household SAR of Adult Contacts The SAR of adult household contacts was estimated at 0 . 32 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 27 - 0 . 37 , I 2 = 99 % ) based on 41 included studies [ Figure S3 ] . Publication bias was also reported in the funnel plot of Figure S4 ( Egger Test , P < 0 . 01 ) . Analysis on adult household contacts of different age groups , the old adults were significantly associated with a higher SAR compared to young adults ( > 60VS < 60 : RR = 1 . 45 , 95 % CI : 1 . 24 - 1 . 70 , I 2 = 52 % ; > 65VS < 65 : RR = 1 . 24 , 95 % CI : 1 . 02 - 1 . 50 , I 2 = 55 % ) . The same trend was also found in the combined analysis ( the old adults VS the young adults : RR = 1 . 35 , 95 % CI : 1 . 19 - 1 . 54 , I 2 = 77 % ) [ Figure S5 ] . 3 . 2 . 3 Household SAR comparison between Child and Adult Contacts In household SAR comparison between child and adult contacts in 37 studies , children were demonstrated to be less likely to be infected by SARS - COV - 2 than adults when exposed to household index cases ( RR = 0 . 74 , 95 % CI : 0 . 64 - 0 . 85 , I 2 = 97 % ) [ Figure 3 ] . No obvious publication bias was found in the funnel plot of Figure S6 ( Egger test , P = 0 . 31 ) . Subgroup analyses of the comparison were performed on research periods and SARS - CoV - 2 variants in Table 4 . In different research periods , 27 studies were carried out between 2019 and February 2021 , in which lower transmissibility was reported in child contacts than adult 12 contacts ( RR = 0 . 62 , 95 % CI : 0 . 52 - 0 . 75 , I 2 = 95 % ) . For 9 studies between February and November 2021 and 2 studies between November 2021 and 2022 , no significant difference in SAR was found between child and adult contacts ( RR = 0 . 98 , 95 % CI : 0 . 86 - 1 . 12 , I 2 = 80 % ; RR = 1 . 09 , 95 % CI : 0 . 89 - 1 . 34 , I 2 = 73 % ) . Significant difference in RR was reported in different groups of research period ( P < 0 . 01 ) . For different SARS - CoV - 2 variants , children were significantly associated with a lower SAR than adult contacts in 29 studies of the Wild type ( RR = 0 . 65 , 95 % CI : 0 . 55 - 0 . 77 , I 2 = 95 % ) . However , no significant difference in SAR was observed between child and adult contacts in studies of other variants ( Alpha : RR = 1 . 04 , 95 % CI : 0 . 76 - 1 . 42 , I 2 = 76 % ; Delta : RR = 0 . 99 , 95 % CI : 0 . 82 - 1 . 19 , I 2 = 88 % ; Omicron : RR = 1 . 09 , 95 % CI : 0 . 88 - 1 . 35 , I 2 = 74 % ) . Significant difference in RR was also reported in different variants ( P < 0 . 01 ) . 3 . 2 . 2 Household SAR of Child and Adult Index cases A total of 18 studies reported the respective SAR of child and adult index cases in familial clusters . The estimated SAR of the child index case was 0 . 20 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 15 - 0 . 26 , I 2 = 100 % ) . As for the adult index cases , it was 0 . 36 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 27 - 0 . 46 , I 2 = 100 % ) . Compared with the adults , the child index cases were significantly associated with a lower possibility to transmit SARS - CoV - 2 to their family members ( RR = 0 . 64 , 95 % CI : 0 . 50 - 0 . 81 , I 2 = 96 % ) [ Figure 4 ] . 13 3 . 2 . 3 Potential Determinants of the Household SAR Potential determinants of the household transmission of SARS - COV - 2 were identified based on prespecified characteristics and studies with sufficient data [ Table S4 ] . Symptomatic index cases were associated with a higher SAR than asymptomatic index cases ( RR = 2 . 68 , 95 % CI : 1 . 39 - 3 . 58 , I 2 = 94 % ) . In different family relationships , the spouse relationship to index case was reported a significantly higher SAR than other relationships ( RR = 1 . 78 , 95 % CI : 1 . 25 - 2 . 53 , I 2 = 91 % ) , while no same trend was shown in the parent - child relationship ( RR = 0 . 84 , 95 % CI : 0 . 59 - 1 . 19 , I 2 = 87 % ) . Household contacts with comorbidities were at a higher risk of secondary infections than those without ( RR = 1 . 98 , 95 % CI : 1 . 52 - 2 . 59 , I 2 = 63 % ) . In terms of gender , the female contacts were observed to be a little more susceptible than the males ( RR = 1 . 08 , 95 % CI : 1 . 01 - 1 . 16 , I 2 = 42 % ) . Another important factor was the household size : a larger household size might be associated with a lower secondary attack rate ( > 4 VS < 4 : RR = 0 . 69 , 95 % CI : 0 . 55 - 0 . 85 , I 2 = 94 % ; > 6 VS < 6 : RR = 0 . 69 , 95 % CI : 0 . 50 - 0 . 95 , I 2 = 90 % ) . 4 . Discussion Analyses of the household transmission of SARS - COV - 2 will certainly facilitate a better understanding of the transmission chain and 14 contribute to the epidemic control . Many studies have been conducted on household secondary attack rate of SARS - COV - 2 ( Fung , et al . , 2021 ; Koh , et al . , 2020 ; Li , et al . , 2021 ; Madewell , et al . , 2020 ; Shah , et al . , 2020 ; Thompson , et al . , 2021 ) , but only a minority focused on the child group . Irfan and Zhu performed meta - analyses on the role of children in household transmission in the early periods of the epidemic , but the results were still unclear because of the limited number of included studies and pediatric index cases ( Irfan , et al . , 2021 ; Zhu , et al . , 2021 ) . Based on these previous research , larger quantities of articles were included in our study . With more timely articles , more comprehensive analyses were conducted . Besides the total pooled household SAR of child contacts and index cases , subgroup analyses were also performed in different SARS - CoV - 2 variants and different periods , as well as the transmissibility comparison between child and adult contacts . To the best of our knowledge , almost no previous meta - analyses have been conducted on the pediatric household transmission of different SARS - CoV - 2 variants . As our results show , both the child index cases and secondary cases only comprised a small proportion of the household transmission in case analyses , which suggested that children were unlikely to be the main source of SARS - COV - 2 in familial clusters . In the total unclassified results of SAR meta - analyses , lower household transmissibility was demonstrated in both pediatric index cases and contacts compared to adults . This was consistent with these previous meta - analyses ( Grijalva , et al . , 2020 ; Madewell , et al . , 2021 , 2020 ; Zhu , et al . , 2021 ) . All these 15 findings are implying that children are less vulnerable to SARS - COV - 2 than adults . Just as large previous data shown , the old adults also had a higher SAR than the young . Contrary to Zhu’s analysis ( Zhu , et al . , 2021 ) , significant difference was found between children < 10 and children > 10 in our analyses and a recent population - based cohort study also suggested a higher transmissibility of SARS - COV - 2 in younger children than the older ( Paul , et al . , 2021 ) . However , this difference still lacked statistical power because of the limited included studies and relatively little advantage , and negative results also occurred in our comprehensive analyses . Therefore , more future studies are still required . Notably , some new findings were found in subgroup analyses on household SAR of different periods and SARS - COV - 2 variants . In the early period of the pandemic ( the Wild type mainly dominated during 2019 - 2020 ) , a relatively low household SAR was observed in children ( 10 % - 30 % ) and child contacts usually had lower transmissibility than adults . However , with the emergence of some new variants ( Alpha and Delta ) from the beginning of 2021 , household SAR in children seemed to be higher than before ( 30 % - 40 % ) . Consistent with our results , many epidemiologic studies had pointed out that children and adolescents had become more susceptible to these new variants ( Allen , et al . , 2022 ; Chun , et al . , 2022 ; Li , et al . , 2022 ; Ng , et al . , 2021 ; Paul , et al . , 2021 ) . At the end of 2021 , Omicron occurred with the highest transmissibility so far : household SAR in both children and adults seemed to be over 50 % . Plenty of recent research also reported the rapid increase in infections and hospitalizations caused by Omicron ( Baker , et al . , 2022 ; Cloete , et al . , 2022 ; Elliott , et al . , 2022 ; Marks , et al . , 2022 ) . What’s more , no 16 significant difference was found in household SAR comparison between children and adults with new variants in our analyses , which also supported the increased vulnerability in children . This was in line with the result of a newly published meta - analysis conducted by Viner Russell ( Viner , et al . , 2022 ) . Some research attributed the increased transmissibility to immune escape and reduced effectiveness of vaccination ( Meng , et al . , 2022 ; Mlcochova , et al . , 2021 ; Planas , et al . , 2021 ) . However , large data has still proved the protective effect of vaccination even in new variant periods ( Fowlkes , et al . , 2022 ; Harris , et al . , 2021 ; Prunas , et al . , 2022 ) . Limited by insufficient data , subgroup analysis on vaccination status was not conducted and the number of articles included in variants analyses was also small . Therefore , original studies that include more virological data and information on the vaccination status of the participants are still very necessary for more convincing results . Interpretation of the result in determinant assessment should be more conservative considering the high heterogeneity . A higher SAR was observed in the symptomatic index cases than those asymptomatic . Extensive evidence has proved that mild or asymptomatic patients are less contagious than those with typical clinical symptoms ( Cevik , et al . , 2021 ; Heald - Sargent , et al . , 2020 ; Luo , et al . , 2020 ) . A larger household size might be associated with a lower SAR . One possible reason may be that large families usually have a low average age and young people tend to be less susceptible . The spouse relationship emerged as a susceptible group in our result . Chaw suggested that intimate relationships with frequent interaction and prolonged proximity in a closed environment were risk factors ( Chaw , et al . , 2020 ) . But negative outcome occurred in 17 the parent - child relationship , which might result from the children’s low vulnerability . Household contacts with comorbidities or female contacts were found to be more susceptible , which were also reported in many large population studies ( Lyngse , et al . , 2022 ; Prunas , et al . , 2022 ) . There are several limitations of our systematic review and meta - analysis . Firstly , articles included in case analyses were limited and relatively insufficient , larger datasets or more scientific methods are necessary for a more accurate prevalence assessment . In meta - analyses , some included studies were of retrospective or cross - sectional type and the information of index cases and contacts was mainly obtained from contact tracing datasets . Therefore , the determination of the case status might be uncertain , especially asymptomatic child index cases were often mistakenly identified as secondary cases , distorting transmission pathways . The epidemiological information was self‐reported and subject to recall bias and response bias . In addition , the SAR would be overestimated for not excluding infection resource outside the household and was also underestimated in studies where only the symptomatic contacts were tested . Because of the data insufficiency , many other potential determinants associated with the SAR were not investigated in detail , such as the incubation and infectious periods and public lockdown policy , and subgroup analyses of child index cases were not conducted either . Lastly and most importantly , high unexplained heterogeneity in our analyses constituted an important obstacle when interpreting the results . This might be attributed to the great variation in the design of studies : different definitions of index cases and contacts , inconsistent testing protocols and follow - up time , sociodemographic factors , and so on . Many 18 previous meta - analyses on SAR also ran into the same dilemma ( Irfan , et al . , 2021 ; Madewell , et al . , 2020 ; Shah , et al . , 2020 ; Zhu , et al . , 2021 ) . All of these implied a multitude of related factors and substantial differences among populations . Therefore , the generalizability of our results is limited : compared with the quantitative results , the qualitative conclusions might be more reliable . 5 . Conclusion Although children were demonstrated not to be dominant in the household transmission , their transmissibility of SARS - CoV - 2 appeared on the rise as new variants emerge . Given the potentially serious complications of pediatric COVID - 19 , vaccination research and implementation in children remain a must .
