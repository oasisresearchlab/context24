This paper proposes that purely technological uncertainty derives from inventors’ search processes with unfamiliar components and component combinations . Experimentation with new components and new combinations leads to less useful inventions on average , but it also implies an increase in the variability that can result in both failure and breakthrough . Negative binomial count and dispersion models with patent citation data demonstrate that new combinations are indeed more variable . In contrast to predictions , however , the reuse of components has a nonmonotonic and eventually positive effect on variability . ( Invention ; Search ; Recombination ; Negative Binomial Dispersion Model ) Introduction While many have acknowledged the pervasive uncertainty of technological change ( Rosenberg 1996 ) , the ultimate sources of that uncertainty remain poorly understood . Many scholars in the product life - cycle tradition have observed that uncertainty peaks early and decreases following convergence on a dominant design ( Anderson and Tushman 1990 , Klepper 1997 ) . Radical and destabilizing change and the sources of the life cycle are particularly difﬁcult to predict and often attributed to luck or individual genius ( Tushman and Anderson 1986 , Ayres 1988 , Mokyr 1990 ) . Clark ( 1985 ) proposes that technologies evolve and uncer - tainty decreases as inventors iterate between the needs of customers and the technological logic of their cur - rent trajectory . Much research remains agnostic about the causal sources of uncertainty and simply models it as stochastic draws ( Nelson and Winter 1982 , Klep - per 1996 ) . Proponents of bounded rationality often characterize technological change as an intrinsically uncertain and , to varying degrees , blind search pro - cess ( Nelson and Winter 1982 , Vincente 1990 , March 1991 ) . While the assumptions of bounded rational - ity may be more accurate than those of classical eco - nomics , the metaphor of search remains informal and was only recently developed empirically ( Stuart and Podolny 1996 ) . Despite this widespread acknowledg - ment of the importance of uncertainty , most research gives the topic brief consideration en route to other issues , and little work has attempted to identify and empirically validate the causal sources of uncertainty . Part of the difﬁculty in explaining the ultimate source of uncertainty is the conceptual and empiri - cal conﬂation of its many sources , and , in particular , technological invention and commercial innovation . There exist many causes of uncertainty in techno - logical change besides purely technological sources , including the adoption and diffusion of new technolo - gies , market and customer acceptance , and competi - tors’ strategic actions ( Rosenberg 1996 ) . Arguments for intentional conﬂation of these sources notwithstand - ing ( Ruttan 1959 ) , our confusion could be reduced by returning to the classic differentiation between technological invention and commercial innovation . Schumpeter ( 1939 ) deﬁned innovation as the com - 0025 - 1909 / 01 / 4701 / 0117 $ 5 . 00 1526 - 5501 electronic ISSN Management Science © 2001 INFORMS Vol . 47 , No . 1 , January 2001 pp . 117 – 132 D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 157 . 182 . 150 . 22 ] on 16 A p r il 2015 , a t 08 : 52 .

He argued that , “the making of the invention and the carrying out of the corresponding innovation are , economically and sociologically , two entirely differ - ent things” ( p . 85 ) . While these sources remain inter - dependent , their conﬂation confuses our explanations of their respective processes and contributions to uncertainty . To avoid such confusion , this paper will focus on invention and purely technological sources of uncertainty . Attempts to understand the source of technological uncertainty have also been frustrated by a lack of understanding of the process by which inventors create new technologies . A theory of the process of invention would facilitate our understanding of the sources of technological uncertainty . To address this issue , this paper synthesizes two classic perspec - tives on the sources of technological novelty : ﬁrst , invention is a process of recombination , and , second , invention is indeed an inherently uncertain and , there - fore , typically local search process . Invention As a Process of Recombinant Search Many scholars have proposed that recombination pro - vides the ultimate source of novelty ( Gilﬁllan 1935 , Usher 1954 ) . Schumpeter ( 1939 , p . 88 ) observed that “innovation combines components in a new way , or that it consists in carrying out New Combina - tions . ” Nelson and Winter ( 1982 , p . 130 ) state that “the creation of any sort of novelty in art , science , or practical life—consists to a substantial extent of a recombination of conceptual and physical materi - als that were previously in existence . ” Henderson and Clark ( 1990 ) argue that the mere rearrangement of previously used components can itself cause destabi - lizing industrial change . Hargadon and Sutton ( 1997 ) describe how a design consulting ﬁrm creates nov - elty by brokering ideas and technologies between their clients’ industries . 1 Basalla ( 1988 ) develops an analogy 1 While the concept of recombinant search as the source of novelty may well apply outside the strictly focused realm of invention— indeed , to cuisine , innovation ( Abernathy and Utterback 1978 , Kogut and Zander 1992 , Levinthal 1998 ) , and process improvement ( Romer 1993 ) —I can only comment empirically on invention . from Kroeber’s ( 1948 ) image of a tree of cultural artifacts . Unlike genetic trees , however , the branches of the tree of technology can fuse together . “Separate types or branches fuse together to produce new types , which merge once again with still other branches” ( Kroeber 1948 , p . 138 ) . Similar to the theory of natural evolution before the discovery of DNA , the analogy breaks down at the genetic level . “We who postulate theories of techological evolution likewise have our Darwins but not our Mendels” ( Kroeber 1948 , p . 210 ) . Although the idea of recombination as the source of novelty has been widely discussed , the implications of the idea remain undeveloped . Previous work suggests , however ( Schumpeter 1939 , Henderson and Clark 1990 ) , that an invention can be deﬁned as either a new combination of components or a new relationship between previously combined components . While knowledge , science , algorithms , culture , applications , and manufacturing processes also inﬂuence invention , they are not part of an actual artifact and are not actually instantiated in an invention . They strongly inﬂuence the process of inventive search , however , by inspiring , aiding , explaining , or constraining the use of particular components or combinations . Collo - quial usage of the word “components” implies known , available , and commercially available hardware . In this paper , however , “components” will denote the constituents of invention , along the lines of what Schumpeter calls “factors” ( 1939 , p . 88 ) . The Scope of Potential Recombination Even though the number of potential components overwhelms the imagination , there are no restrictions on the scope of their recombination . Components are not like genes and “similar” technologies are not like species ( Basalla 1988 ) . In contrast to variation processes within genetically isolated populations , inventors can recombine any components within their purview . Perceptions that certain technologies or com - ponents “belong together” develop through social construction and previous association . For example , if an electrical engineer of the 1940s had been asked about his profession’s use of sand and aluminum , he probably would have replied with a blank stare . Today , he or she probably would reply that they are the most common basic materials of semiconductors 118 Management Science / Vol . 47 , No . 1 , January 2001 D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 157 . 182 . 150 . 22 ] on 16 A p r il 2015 , a t 08 : 52 .

Clearly , no technology evolves independently of the entire world of made things . At any point in technological evolu - tion , any component is at risk of being recombined with any other component . The made world evolves as a holistic , continuous , and interdependent web , and not as a disjoint assortment of separate trajectories or product life cycles . Investors constantly import previously untried components from outside the extant made world , for example , the use of medicinal substances from tropical jungles or the exploitation of petroleum and natural gas , substances that had little application to technology prior to the 19th century . Investors also create new components through encapsulation and hierarchical modularization of component sets ( Simon 1996 , Baldwin and Clark 1999 ) . Such “black box” engi - neering efforts make the underlying components less salient but do not destroy the recombinant potential of the components or the encapsulating module . As these processes make additional components available for further recombination , the diversity of the “made” world increases . Because all previously used compo - nents and inventions provide potential constituents for future inventions , the potential risk set for recom - bination is the entire extant made world . Because inventors also scan outside the made world , anything not yet derived from the natural world can also be considered as a potential constituent of invention , as part of the theoretical risk set . Recombination usually occurs , however , between components that are salient , proximal , and available for the inventor . These ideas prompt us to look backward in time to consider the components and untried combinations that were available at the time of invention ; they prompt us to look forward to predict which inven - tions are more likely to motivate further recombi - nation . Prediction of further recombination depends on the fundamental tension between exploration of untried possibilities and exploitation of previous suc - cesses ( March 1991 ) . Cognitive , Social , and Technological Inﬂuences on Recombination Because the agents of recombination are people , the process of invention remains strongly inﬂuenced by cognitive and social phenomena . The most fundamental inﬂuence is a limitation on the num - ber of potential components and combinations that an inventor can simultaneously consider . Because every invention can be incorporated in further recombina - tions , inventors’ combinatoric potential has grown explosively ( Weitzman 1996 ) . The set of potential com - binations and , a fortiori , the possible ways that each set of potential combinations can be combined has become essentially inﬁnite . It has become impossible for individual inventors , groups , even entire commu - nities of inventors to have more than an inﬁnitesimal understanding of all these potential combinations and relationships . As a result of this combinatoric explosion , inventors and their organizations and communities must focus and recombine locally from a limited set of components and combinations . These arguments follow the assumption of bounded rationality and local search ( March and Simon 1958 , Nelson and Winter 1982 , Cohen and Levinthal 1990 , March 1991 , Kauffman 1993 , Stuart and Podolny 1996 ) . Localness corresponds to inventors’ familiar - ity with their recombinant search space . Local search or exploitation ( March 1991 ) occurs when an inven - tor recombines from a familiar set of technology components or reﬁnes a previously used combina - tion . A pastry chef searches extremely locally when he mixes previously used dyes in a new propor - tion to create a novel frosting color . Distant search or exploration ( March 1991 ) occurs in the opposite sit - uation , when inventors try completely new compo - nents or combinations . The early auto industry pro - vides many examples of successful and unsuccessful distant search including various power sources , pneu - matic tires , brakes for each passenger , four - wheeled diamond conﬁgurations , and , in the 1930s , a combined car and plane conﬁguration ( Basalla 1988 ) . One would expect that local recombination is more certain and , on average , more successful . To the extent that inventors draw from familiar compo - nent sets and reﬁne previous combinations , they are less likely to develop a completely useless invention . They also decrease their upside potential , however , of developing a radically different invention that is of much greater impact . Local recombination is more certain because inventors learn from past failures .

FLEMING Recombinant Uncertainty in Technological Search Inventors learn which components failed in previ - ous inventions and stop using them . They learn to avoid the combinations and architectures that failed in the past . They winnow and bound the less suc - cessful regions of recombinant space ( Vincenti 1990 ) . This winnowing and bounding improves the average usefulness of inventive efforts but also decreases the possibility of wildly successful inventions . As inventors reuse components they begin to understand and characterize those components . They begin to understand which components are more or less useful in different contexts . Such knowledge enables selection and exploitation of more appropriate components in future inventions . Understanding and knowledge increase with use ; the greater the use of a component , the greater the knowledge of and famil - iarity with it . Knowledge can also be forgotten , how - ever , and is therefore more potent the more recently it has been gained ( Argote et al . 1990 ) . More recent and frequent usage therefore implies greater knowledge and familiarity . Inventions that incorporate familiar components should be more useful because inventors can select more appropriate components . Because they can better predict the performance of the included components , incorporation of familiar components should also decrease inventive uncertainty and , hence , the variability of outcomes . Inventors can draw on others’ knowledge and experience in addition to their own . While social prox - imity certainly increases the ease and likelihood of sharing , knowledge about component use will still dif - fuse between organizations ( Allen 1977 ) and techno - logical communities ( Bijker 1987 ) . Many mechanisms facilitate knowledge diffusion , including person - nel movement , personal friendships , organizational merger , education , reverse engineering , technical liter - ature , and strategic alliances ( Ahuja 2000 ) . Although much knowledge will be lost or changed in its dif - fusion , sharing will take place at all social levels , between individuals , organizations , and communities . Taken together , these arguments imply the following . Hypothesis 1 . Recombination of familiar components will increase an invention’s usefulness . Hypothesis 2 . Recombination of familiar components will decrease inventive uncertainty . Parallel arguments hold for the reﬁnement and improvement of combinations . Engineers gain expe - rience with particular combinations by using them . As inventors learn which combination relationships or architectures are less useful , they avoid those approaches . Such learning and knowledge helps them improve their inventive efforts on average and decrease inventive uncertainty . As with knowledge about individual components , knowledge about com - bination relationships increases with frequency of use and decreases since last use . As with individual com - ponents , knowledge of combinations and their opti - mal relationships will diffuse throughout the made world . These arguments imply combination hypothe - ses that parallel the individual component hypotheses . Hypothesis 3 . Reﬁnement of familiar combinations will increase an invention’s usefulness . Hypothesis 4 . Reﬁnement of familiar combinations will decrease inventive uncertainty . Practitioners have long recognized the value of reuse and reﬁnement ( Mead and Carver 1980 ) and the difﬁculty of exploring new regions of the essentially inﬁnite design space . For example , Altschuler ( 1998 ) explicitly recommends searching previous inventions for universal analogies and possible applications to new contexts , and Goldenberg et al . ( 1999 ) propose and empirically validate a method to identify and link proﬁtable dependencies between previously used components . Unfortunately for inventors , however , these beneﬁts of familiarity do not last forever . This results from the technological and social - psychological exhaustion of potential reﬁnements , given a particular combination . Both inﬂuences run counter to the posi - tive effects of local search . Technological exhaustion occurs because most of the possible relationships between a set of compo - nents have already been tried . As Kim and Kogut ( 1996 ) argue , “The repeated application of a particular set of technologies or organizing principles eventually exhausts the set of potential combinations . ” The argu - ment generalizes Sahal’s ( 1985 ) demonstration of the decreasing returns to physical scaling . For example , if semiconductor inventors restricted their usage to their original materials of aluminum and bipolar transis - tors , progress in the ﬁeld would have halted long ago . 120 Management Science / Vol . 47 , No . 1 , January 2001 D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 157 . 182 . 150 . 22 ] on 16 A p r il 2015 , a t 08 : 52 .

FLEMING Recombinant Uncertainty in Technological Search However , because inventors began using new materi - als such as copper interconnect and new combinations such as metal oxide semiconductors , semiconductor chips have continued to shrink and the trajectory has repeatedly avoided exhaustion . Exhaustion in technological potential also stems from social and psychological sources and can ulti - mately be traced to inventors’ frames and “imagi - nary life cycles” ( Henderson 1995 ) . If a community of inventors accepts or reiﬁes a particular combination as mature , then they are less likely try new combinations or broaden their component set . Henderson describes three such attitudes in her study of the premature obituaries for optical lithography in 1977 : Inventors failed to consider the possibility of new architec - tures , improvement in their components , or changes in users’ application of the technology . These tech - nological and social - psychological effects run counter to the improvement that results from familiarity and learning . Hypothesis 5 . Cumulative use of a combination will decrease an invention’s usefulness . Methods Thinking of invention as a recombinant search pro - cess implies that an invention’s usefulness and uncer - tainty can be predicted from previous usage of its components and particular combination of compo - nents . I test these ideas with patent data and estima - tion of a statistical model . The models predict future prior art citations to a given patent based on previous usage of its assigned subclasses and particular combi - nation of subclasses . The hypotheses place additional constraints on the empirical work , however . If engi - neers can recombine any technology with any other , the data should include recombination across techno - logical communities . If invention is a process of search , learning , and exhaustion , the data should include the history of component and combination use . Finally , if the uncertainty of invention decreases with learn - ing and the use of familiar components and combina - tions , the statistical model should estimate the impact of such learning and familiarity on the variability of inventive outcomes . Data The unit of analysis is an U . S . patent granted dur - ing May or June of 1990 (cid:1)n = 17 (cid:3) 264 (cid:4) . 2 The data came from the MicroPatent ( 1996 ) product . While patent data are admittedly imperfect records of technology ( Levin et al . 1987 ) and conditional on a successful patent application , these data still represent a large portion of failed and successful invention . Indepen - dent measures ( recombinant history ) came from data before July of 1990 and dependent measures ( citations ) came from data after July 1 , 1990 . Citations are used as controls and a dependent variable only—they are not used to trace the path of combination reuse , learn - ing , or the diffusion of knowledge . The design is cross - sectional and does not consider multiple time periods . While the sample is large enough to provide very sig - niﬁcant results for all the hypothesis tests , future work should consider other time periods to minimize the chances of idiosyncratic sampling . I observe recombination across all technological communities by looking simultaneously at all patents granted during the two - month time period , thus sat - isfying the ﬁrst modeling constraint . If the data did not consider all communities simultaneously , I would need to deﬁne the boundaries between particular technological communities . Because such boundaries are transient , permeable , overlapping , and nested , it would be empirically intractable to determine them for even a fraction of the made world . Finally , two hundred years of patent data satisfy the need to observe recombinant history of component and com - bination use . Measures Table 1 lists and describes all variables . For the depen - dent variables of mean and variance , I measure an invention’s usefulness as the number of prior art cita - tions that it receives from subsequent patents . To be granted a patent , the applicant must establish the nov - elty of her invention relative to all previous inventions . She establishes her claim to novelty by identifying ( almost always after the fact of invention ) and citing similar “prior art . ” The patent examiner then reviews and usually supplements these citations ( Carr 1995 ) . 2 I chose the months of May and June at random .

S . patents with exactly same subclass combination Bibliometric studies have repeatedly demonstrated that future prior citations to a patent correlate with its technological importance and value ( Albert et al . 1991 , Hall et al . 2000 ) . To make maximal use of the data , I measure prior art citations to a focal patent for 6 years and 5 months after its granting . This period should capture the bulk of citations to a patent as these citations typically reach a plateau after about three years from the grant date ( Jaffe et al . 1993 ) . While there appears to be strong correlation between the rates of early and later citations to a patent , researchers are actively pursuing the topic ( Hall et al . 2000 ) . To measure the independent variables , I proxy com - ponents with patent subclasses . The patent ofﬁce cat - egorizes all patentable technologies into some 400 “class references” . Each class is also subdivided into very ﬁne divisions of technology or approximately 100 , 000 “subclasses” ( Trajtenberg et al . 1997 ) . The patent ofﬁce typically assigns each patent into mul - tiple subclasses within and across major classes . The patent ofﬁce also establishes and updates new classes and subclasses each year , as technology changes ( Carr 1995 , p . 128 ) . This retrospective updating enables historical consistency in the measurement of compo - nents across time . I do not propose that inventors recombine patent subclasses directly , only that subclasses can be used to observe indirectly the process of recombinant search and learning . I will illustrate the correspon - dence between components and patent subclasses with patent 5 , 136 , 185 , coauthored with John Walther . It was ( as of Dec . 1996 ) classiﬁed in four subclasses : 326 / 16 ( with test facilitating feature ) , 326 / 31 ( signal sensitivity or transmission integrity ) , 326 / 56 ( tristate ( i . e . , high impedance as third state ) ) , and 326 / 82 ( current driving ( e . g . , fan in / out , off chip driving , etc . ) ) . Each of these subclasses corresponded to a well - understood digital hardware component at that time . Each of them can be found in ( and , for this patent , were drawn speciﬁcally from ) contemporary textbooks of digital design such as McCluskey ( 1986 ) . A test facilitate feature ( p . 426 ) has become a neces - sity with large computer chips due to their millions of gates . To test the innards of a chip , the chip must be operated in a “test mode . ” A transmission gate ( p . 118 ) simply passes on a signal when enabled . 122 Management Science / Vol . 47 , No . 1 , January 2001 D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 157 . 182 . 150 . 22 ] on 16 A p r il 2015 , a t 08 : 52 . F o r p e r s o n a l u s e on l y , a ll r i gh t s r e s e r v e d . FLEMING Recombinant Uncertainty in Technological Search A tristate driver ( back cover diagram of digital com - ponents and pp . 105 , 119 , 142 ) is a gate that can drive a bus or be turned off to present high impedance to the bus . Finally , “fan in” and “fan out” ( p . 104 ) refers to the number of components that can drive or be driven by a particular gate ( high fan out basically means a big gate ) . While we were not aware of the subclass deﬁnitions at the time of the invention , we were very familiar with these basic building blocks of our tech - nological community , namely digital hardware engi - neers . I propose that subclasses serve as proxies for these building blocks . With the subclassiﬁcations and date of application of each patent ( interpolated prior to 1975 ) , I develop the three independent variables for each focal patent : component familiarity , combination familiarity , and cumulative combination usage . Component familiarity proxies inventors’ familiarity with components , based on the average degree to which the components have been recently and frequently used . The assumption is that inventors will be more familiar with compo - nents that have been recently and frequently used . I ﬁrst calculate an individual measure for each sepa - rate subclass of the focal patent . To the extent that a particular subclass has been recently and frequently used , its individual measure will be higher . For each focal patent , I look backward to 1790 and consider each of its individual subclasses in turn . Whenever a particular subclass has been used in any previous invention , I multiply the indicator of occurrence by an exponentially decaying component ( 1 ) . This expo - nential component represents the loss and forgetting of knowledge . For example , it is more likely that an inventor will have learned from previous use of a subclass , if that sub - class was used three years prior , instead of thirty . These occurrences are then summed and averaged ( 2 ) . Individual component familiarity of patent i ’s subclass j ≡ I ij = (cid:1) allpatents k granted beforepatent i 1 (cid:9) patent k uses subclass j(cid:10) ( 1 ) × e − (cid:2) application dateof patent i − application dateof patent k timeconstant of knowledgeloss (cid:3) (cid:12) Average component familiarity of patent i (cid:5) s subclasses ≡ F i = (cid:4) allsubclasses j ofpatent i I ij (cid:4) allsubclasses j ofpatent i 1 (cid:12) ( 2 ) I set the time constant of knowledge loss at ﬁve years . This constant in the denominator of the expo - nential implies that approximately one - third of the knowledge remains after ﬁve years , or a yearly loss rate of 18 % . Argote , Epple , and Darr ( Argote et al . 1990 , Epple et al . 1991 , Darr et al . 1995 ) have estimated a much higher geometric loss parameter for manu - facturing and service organizations , between 40 % to 97 % per year . It is unlikely that design technology would experience such a high rate of loss , however . Design knowledge is far less contextual and more eas - ily articulated than manufacturing or service experi - ence . Design knowledge is more likely to have been recorded in trade journals , ﬁrm documentation and , of course , patents . It may have been actually real - ized in prototypes and products and is far more likely to have required substantial personal effort and investment on the part of its designers . All of these inﬂuences would argue for a slower loss rate than manufacturing and service organizations , but the pre - cise estimation certainly constitutes a valid research question . I calculate combination familiarity and cumulative combination usage similarly . The cumulative usage measures how many times since 1790 a particular combination of subclasses has been used . Combina - tion familiarity proxies inventors’ familiarity with the combination , based on the degree to which the com - bination has been recently and frequently used . For each focal patent , I consider its particular combina - tion of subclasses . I then look back in time at all other patents that used an identical combination of subclasses . For each previous patent that used an identical combination of subclasses , I increment the cumulative combination usage ( 3 ) . For the combi - nation familiarity variable , I multiply each indicator count by the exponential component , to reﬂect the loss and forgetting of experiential knowledge regard - ing the combination ( 4 ) . All the measures remain indi - rect because they assume that learning occurs with use and that knowledge diffuses throughout technological Management Science / Vol . 47 , No . 1 , January 2001 123 D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 157 . 182 . 150 . 22 ] on 16 A p r il 2015 , a t 08 : 52 .

Given that all the independent variables are highly skewed , I took the square root of their original value . This minimized the effects of outliers and enabled more parsimonious modeling . Cumulative combination usage of patent i ≡ C i = (cid:4) all patents k granted before patent i 1 (cid:9) patent k uses identical combination of subclasses as patent i(cid:10) ( 3 ) Combination familiarity for patent i ≡ R i = (cid:4) all patents k granted before patent i 1 (cid:9) patent k uses identical combination of subclasses as patent i (cid:10) × e (cid:2) application date of patent i − application date of patent k time constant of knowledge loss (cid:3) ( 4 ) Given the theoretical interest in recombinant search , the models should ideally control for other differences between inventions , for example , the differences in citation patterns across different technology classes . I calculate technology mean and variance by measuring citations to a technology class prior to the dependent measures period . I ﬁrst calculate the expected num - ber of citations to each class in the ﬁve and a half years prior to July of 1990 ( 5 ) . Equation ( 6 ) illustrates similar calculations for the variance of each patent class . Using these numbers for each class , I control for the expected mean and variance of citations to each focal patent based on a weighted average of its assigned technology class references . I calculate this by multiplying the proportion of a patent’s subclass assignments within a particular class by the average cites / class of that class . As an additional control of differences in citation activity , I include the number of prior art citations that a focal patent makes to previous patents . Although none of these measures differences across industry directly , in aggregate they provide some control of nonrecombinant heterogeneity , to the extent that industries have similar technologies and citation patterns . Average citations to a patent classiﬁed within class i ≡ (cid:16) i = (cid:1) all patents i granted from 1985 − 1990 (cid:12) 5 1 (cid:9) patent j cites a patent within class i(cid:10) ∗ (cid:1) proportion of cited patent within class i(cid:4) (cid:1) all patents k granted from 1985 − 1990 1 (cid:9) patent k classiﬁed within class i(cid:10) ∗ (cid:1) proportion of patent k within class i(cid:4) ( 5 ) Variance in citations to patents classiﬁed within class i ≡ (cid:21) 2 i = (cid:1) all patents k granted from 1985 − 1990 (cid:12) 5 1 (cid:9) patent k classiﬁed within class i(cid:10) ∗ (cid:1) proportion of patent k within class i(cid:4) ∗ (cid:1) cites k − (cid:16) i (cid:4) 2 (cid:1) all patents k granted from 1985 − 1990 (cid:12) 5 1 (cid:9) patent k classiﬁed within class i(cid:10) ∗ (cid:1) proportion of patent k within class i(cid:4) ( 6 ) Given the theoretical assumptions of bounded ratio - nality and component search , the models should con - trol for the number of the invention’s components . These can be proxied by the focal patent’s number of subclasses . Because it becomes increasingly difﬁcult for an exact match to occur as the number of compo - nents increases , I include a second - order term for this as well . 3 Because the recombinant history of patents with only one subclass remains unobservable , I also include a dummy variable for single subclass patents ( they comprise 8 . 1 % of the data ) . Finally , the models should control for artifacts of the patenting system . The patent ofﬁce periodically updates technology classiﬁcations and creates new subclasses ( these analyses use the classiﬁcations in effect as of November 1996 ) . Because such reclassiﬁca - tion essentially recognizes newly successful technolo - gies , the ﬁrst few patents of a retrospectively identiﬁed technology stream are likely to be highly seminal . Hence , patents that include a newly designated sub - class will probably be highly cited . I include a newest 3 I would like to thank an anonymous reviewer for this suggestion . In addition to adding the squared term , I checked the sensitivity of the results by estimating the model separately on subsets of the data , for patents classiﬁed in two and three subclasses . The results agreed with those presented below . 124 Management Science / Vol . 47 , No . 1 , January 2001 D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 157 . 182 . 150 . 22 ] on 16 A p r il 2015 , a t 08 : 52 .

Negative Binomial Count Models The dependent variable of citation counts takes on only whole number values ( that is , 0 , 1 , 2 , etc . ) . The use of a linear regression model on such data can yield inefﬁcient , inconsistent , and biased coefﬁcient estimates ( Long 1997 ) . Explicit count models can avoid these problems . Researchers often use Poisson models to analyze count data , but Poisson models assume that the mean and variance of the observed distribution are equal . These data , like most count data , exhibit over - dispersion—the variance is greater than the mean . Negative binomial regressions explicitly accommo - date this over - dispersion , however , by enabling the variance to be greater than the mean . Recent develop - ments ( King 1989 , Jorgensen 1997 ) also support inde - pendent estimation of effects on the mean and the variance of the predicted mean , as functions of poten - tially differing sets of variables . To begin with , consider a model that estimates the mean number of citations that a patent should receive , given its independent variables . The observed cita - tions to the patent will not correspond exactly to the prediction , however , and will be distributed with some variance around the expected mean . I opera - tionalize the uncertainty of invention by estimating the effects of substantive variables on this variance .

FLEMING Recombinant Uncertainty in Technological Search variable decreases inventive uncertainty , its effect on the variance of this error distribution should be negative . Most derivations of the negative binomial start from a basic Poisson model ( 7 ) . The basic Poisson model estimates the probability of an observed count , condi - tional on an expected mean (cid:16) i . To avoid negative ( i . e . , undeﬁned ) expected values for the mean (cid:16) i , Poisson models typically parameterize explanatory variables as an exponential function ( 8 ) . The method of maxi - mum likelihood is then applied to the joint frequency formed from the product of the marginal frequencies of ( 7 ) , to determine the coefﬁcient values that are most likely to result in the observed counts . Pr (cid:1)y i (cid:7) x i (cid:4) = e − (cid:16) i (cid:16) y i i y i ! (cid:12) ( 7 ) E(cid:1)y i (cid:7) x i (cid:4) = (cid:16) i = e (cid:1)x i (cid:25)(cid:4) (cid:12) ( 8 ) The negative binomial model replaces the Poisson mean (cid:16) i with the random variable ˜ (cid:16) i ( 9 ) . This replace - ment enables the inclusion of an error term (cid:26) i = e (cid:27) i — and allows the predicted mean to vary according to the distribution of the error term . Substitution of ˜ (cid:16) i for (cid:16) i in ( 7 ) results in ( 10 ) . ˜ (cid:16) i = e (cid:1)x i (cid:25) + (cid:27) i (cid:4) = (cid:16) i (cid:26) i (cid:12) ( 9 ) Pr (cid:1)y i (cid:7) x i (cid:3)(cid:26) i (cid:4) = e − (cid:16) i (cid:26) i (cid:1)(cid:16) i (cid:26) i (cid:4) y i y i ! (cid:12) ( 10 ) When ˜ (cid:16) i replaces (cid:16) i in ( 10 ) , the probability of the observed count becomes conditional on the error dis - tribution . This conditioning can be removed , however , by specifying the error distribution and integrating with its probability density function to obtain the marginal density . Most formulations specify a gamma distribution for (cid:26) i with parameter (cid:28) i and probabil - ity density function g(cid:1)(cid:26) i (cid:4) as in ( 11 ) ( Hausman et al . 1984 , Cameron and Trivedi 1986 , King 1989 , Long 1997 ) . Although the error term can take other distribu - tions , this parameterization is ﬂexible , computation - ally tractable , and can be derived from a variety of assumptions . While other versions of the gamma dis - tribution take two parameters , this derivation ( from Long 1997 , p . 232 ) sets both to (cid:28) i , which forces the mean of (cid:26) i equal to one and the variance of (cid:26) i equal to 1 / (cid:28) i . Integrating ( 10 ) with the density function of ( 11 ) gives the probability of the negative binomial of ( 12 ) . g(cid:1)(cid:26) i (cid:4) = (cid:28) (cid:28) i i (cid:31)(cid:1)(cid:28) i (cid:4)(cid:26) (cid:28) i − 1 i e (cid:1) − (cid:26) i (cid:28) i (cid:4) for (cid:28) i > 0 (cid:3) and (cid:31)(cid:1)(cid:28)(cid:4) = (cid:5) (cid:11) 0 t (cid:28) − 1 e − t dt(cid:12) ( 11 ) Pr (cid:1)y i (cid:7) x i (cid:4) = (cid:31)(cid:1)y i + (cid:28) i (cid:4) y i ! (cid:31)(cid:1)(cid:28) i (cid:4) (cid:6) (cid:28) i (cid:28) i + (cid:16) i (cid:7) (cid:28) i (cid:6) (cid:16) i (cid:28) i + (cid:16) i (cid:7) y i (cid:12) ( 12 ) While the ﬁrst term of ( 9 ) fully speciﬁes the mean of the negative binomial , various parameterizations of (cid:28) i remain possible . Cameron and Trivedi ( 1986 ) propose the negative binomial II parameterization ( or Negbin II model ) when the variance / mean ratio of the observed data is linear in the mean . By contrast , the Negbin I holds the variance / mean ratio constant . The Negbin II speciﬁcation is also much more robust to distributional misspeciﬁcation than other param - eterizations ( Cameron and Trivedi 1986 ) . I veriﬁed the applicability of the Negbin II by regressing pre - dicted counts on the quantity ( residualsˆ2 / predicted ) . The coefﬁcient and intercept were positive thus sup - porting the Negbin II parameterization ( Cameron and Trivedi 1986 ) . Also consistent with Cameron and Trivedi’s argument ( 1986 ) , Negbin II models demon - strated much more signiﬁcant log likelihoods than Negbin I models . Equation ( 13 ) speciﬁes the Negbin II parameteriza - tion of the conditional variance . # i is the inverse of (cid:28) i and is parameterized as an exponential function , similar to the mean speciﬁcation but with potentially different variables . Since var (cid:1)(cid:26) i (cid:4) = 1 / (cid:28) i = # i , greater variance of the error term for a given estimated mean will result in an increase of # i . I operationalize uncer - tainty by estimating the effects of the causal vari - ables on the dispersion parameter # . Variables that decrease # will decrease the variability and hence the uncertainty of inventive outcomes . Var (cid:1)y i (cid:7) x (cid:4) = (cid:16) (cid:6) 1 + (cid:16) i (cid:28) i (cid:7) = (cid:16) i + # (cid:16) 2 i (cid:12) ( 13 ) STATA estimates ( 12 ) by the method of maximum likelihood . This technique estimates both the mean (cid:16) i and variance 1 / (cid:28) i from ( 12 ) , and hence produces only a single log likelihood . 126 Management Science / Vol . 47 , No . 1 , January 2001 D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 157 . 182 . 150 . 22 ] on 16 A p r il 2015 , a t 08 : 52 .

FLEMING Recombinant Uncertainty in Technological Search Results Table 4 presents estimates for the negative binomial dispersion models of citation counts . Model 1 esti - mates a baseline model of controls only and Model 2 adds substantive variables to the baseline model . Piecewise models indicated a nonmonotonic effect of component familiarity on the dispersion . To accom - modate this , Models 3 and 4 include both ﬁrst - and second - order terms for component familiarity . The substantive variables greatly increase the explanatory power of Models 2 and 3 , as measured by twice the difference in log likelihoods and compared to a chi - squared distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the added number of variables . 4 To test robustness , Model 4 estimates substantive variables only . Coefﬁ - cient magnitudes and signiﬁcances vary but the sub - stantive results remain unchanged and signiﬁcant . To further check for robustness , I split the data set in half , randomly , and by month . Signs remained unchanged although not always signiﬁcant . The parameter esti - mates are not standardized and should be interpreted as the predicted multiplier effect on the mean citation count and dispersion parameter ( they should be expo - nentiated as in ( 8 ) and ( 13 ) ) . Hypothesis one proposes that usage of familiar components will enable inventors to apply learning from previous efforts . Such learning improves inven - tors’ abilities to select the best components and recom - bine them more successfully . Component familiarity has a positive and highly signiﬁcant coefﬁcient esti - mate . A patent receives 147 % more citations at its max - imum value of 2 . 28 as opposed to its lowest value of 0 . 5 To interpret less extreme changes in the vari - able , a one standard deviation increase in component 4 R - squared measures are inappropriate for maximum likeli - hood estimates and suffer from various problems ( Cameron and Windmeijer 1996 ) . Cameron and Windmeijer ( 1996 ) propose an imperfect ( by their argument ) measure for a negative binomial model , but it only considers the explanatory power of variables on the mean . Cameron ( in personal communication ) indicated that an acceptable R - squared measure for measuring the explanatory power of variables on the dispersion parameter has yet to be proposed . 5 At its maximum value of 2 . 28 , and from the coefﬁcient esti - mate of 0 . 3958 in Model 3 , the effect of component familiarity is e (cid:1) 0 (cid:12) 3958 ∗ 2 (cid:12) 28 (cid:4) = 2 (cid:12) 47 . familiarity results in an 11 . 3 % increase in expected citations . 6 While the results support Hypothesis 1 , they do not support Hypothesis 2 , that component learning decreases the uncertainty of invention . Given that the ﬁrst - order term by itself became insigniﬁcant with - out controls ( model not shown ) , I estimated piecewise models to check for a nonlinear effect . These mod - els indicated a nonmonotonic effect , with the max - imum negative effect at the 60th percentile of the data . Compared to a baseline model of no effect of component familiarity on the variance , component familiarity decreases the variance by 9 . 6 % at the 60th percentile . 7 Past that point , the effect becomes less negative and eventually becomes positive at the 96th percentile . It appears that increasing familiarity with components has an initially negative effect on the vari - ability of invention . Eventually this changes , however , such that the use of very familiar components has a positive effect on variability . In parallel to Hypothesis 1 , Hypothesis 3 argues that reuse of familiar combinations lets inventors apply learning from previous efforts . Such learning enables reﬁnement and improvement of previous inventions , such that future inventions are more useful . Com - bination familiarity demonstrates a positive , strong , and highly signiﬁcant effect on the mean . A patent receives 332 % more citations at combination famil - iarity’s highest value of 11 . 25 as opposed to its low - est value of 0 . A one standard deviation increase of combination familiarity results in a 10 . 3 % increase in expected citations . In contrast to the contrary results of component familiarity on the dispersion , combination familiar - ity demonstrates predicted and highly signiﬁcant 6 e (cid:1) 0 (cid:12) 3958 ∗ 0 (cid:12) 27 (cid:4) − 1 = 0 (cid:12) 1128 . 7 The maximum negative effect of component familiarity on the dispersion ( from Model 3 ) occurs at 0 . 5992 . At the mean citation count of 3 . 80 the variance is therefore Var (cid:1)y i (cid:7) x (cid:4) = (cid:16) i + # (cid:16) 2 i = 3 (cid:12) 80 e 0 (cid:12) 3958 ∗ 0 (cid:12) 5992 + e (cid:1) − 0 (cid:12) 4139 ∗ 0 (cid:12) 5992 + 0 (cid:12) 3454 ∗ 0 (cid:12) 59922 (cid:4) (cid:1) 3 (cid:12) 80 e 0 (cid:12) 3958 ∗ 0 (cid:12) 5992 (cid:4) 2 = 25 (cid:12) 32 At the mean citation count of 3 . 80 and no effect of combination familiarity on the dispersion at 0 . 5992 , the variance is Var (cid:1)y i (cid:7) x (cid:4) = (cid:16) i + # (cid:16) 2 i = 3 (cid:12) 80 e 0 (cid:12) 3958 ∗ 0 (cid:12) 5992 + e 0 (cid:1) 3 (cid:12) 80 e 0 (cid:12) 3958 ∗ 0 (cid:12) 5992 (cid:4) 2 = 28 (cid:12) 02 . Hence the maximum negative effect is (cid:1) 28 (cid:12) 02 − 25 (cid:12) 32 (cid:4) / 28 (cid:12) 02 = 9 (cid:12) 6 % less .

The negative effect supports Hypothesis 4 , that inventive uncertainty decreases with the reﬁnement of previously used combinations . At the mean citation count of 3 . 80 and the mean value of combination familiarity at 0 . 28 , the variance is 2 . 2 % less than it would have been without the effect of com - bination familiarity on the dispersion . At the maxi - mum value of combination familiarity , the difference grows to 64 % . Finally , Hypothesis 5 predicts that cumulative use of a particular combination will eventually exhaust recombinant potential . The results support this hypothesis , as indicated by the negative and sig - niﬁcant estimate on cumulative combination usage . When cumulative combination count reaches its max - imum value of 26 . 76 , a patent receives only 37 . 9 % of the citations it would have received at the variable’s lowest value of 0 . A one standard deviation increase of cumulative combination use results in a 5 . 6 % decrease in expected citations . Discussion These results should be viewed cautiously for a variety of reasons . The typical reservations regard - ing the use of patent data certainly apply , most notably that patenting practices and effectiveness vary across industries ( Levin et al . 1987 ) . Furthermore , even though these data cover all patented technologies across a two - month time period , much inventive activ - ity remains unpatented and , hence , unobserved . These issues cause at least three problems . First , the dataset misses unimportant inventions that failed to merit a patent . Use of citation data mitigates this problem , however , because it includes the bulk of relatively use - less inventions that receive no or few citations . Sec - ond , the dataset may miss breakthroughs that ﬁrms chose not to patent , presumably for strategic rea - sons . However , unless there is systematic bias in those ﬁrms’ use of particular components or combinations , these results should remain valid . Third , technolog - ical communities vary in their propensity to patent . Again , while these models controlled for much vari - ance across technologies , they did not introduce explicit industrial controls . But given the focus on recombinant search across technological communities , it would be difﬁcult to compile similarly vast observa - tions across so many communities . The dataset there - fore trades detail and depth in exchange for breadth and possibility of observation . In addition to differences in the dependent variable of citations across communities , the accuracy of the independent variables also varies across communities . Subclasses and combinations of subclasses represent only a proxy for inventors’ components and architec - tures . While the subclasses of digital hardware patents correspond very closely to my engineering experi - ence , other subclasses may not . For example , ﬁnancial patents tend to be classiﬁed in fewer subclasses and , hence , may not reﬂect a process of recombinant search . They may also be better characterized as knowledge or algorithms and not technology . Such patents , however , became popular only after the observation period . In addition to concerns about data and variables , these results also remain open to alternate interpreta - tions . Most importantly , these models cannot deﬁni - tively separate learning and familiarity , technological exhaustion , and life - cycle effects . For example : an exogenous variable ( such as the inventive myopia described by Henderson ( 1995 ) ) could drive the use of particular components and combinations , such that increased citations might simply reﬂect the popular usage of those components and combinations . As a result , the positive signs in the mean for compo - nent and combination familiarity and negative sign for cumulative use might reﬂect only the normal pro - gression of technological life cycles , instead of learn - ing and exhaustion . Even with the multiple controls for differences in citation patterns across technologies , types of combinations , and retrospective identiﬁcation of seminal subclasses , the models cannot convincingly reject the alternative argument that the results merely reﬂect the normal life - cycle progression . These reservations do not apply , however , to the uncertainty hypotheses . Indeed , all of the explana - tory variables in the mean could simply be interpreted as control variables for the dispersion estimates . The combination result supports the intuitive argument that uncertainty decreases with reﬁnement and high - lights the importance of early architectural reﬁne - ments as a source of destabilizing technologies for organizations and industries ( Henderson and Clark Management Science / Vol . 47 , No . 1 , January 2001 129 D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 157 . 182 . 150 . 22 ] on 16 A p r il 2015 , a t 08 : 52 . F o r p e r s o n a l u s e on l y , a ll r i gh t s r e s e r v e d . FLEMING Recombinant Uncertainty in Technological Search 1990 ) . In contrast , the nonmonotonic results for com - ponents does not support the simple linear relation - ship predicted in Hypothesis 2 . It remains consistent , however , with the argument that technological break - throughs derive from new combinations of well - used components ( Usher 1954 , Nelson and Winter 1982 , Sahal 1985 ) . For example , Utterback ( 1996 , p . xxvii ) argues that “radical innovations often are seen to be based on the synthesis of well - known technical information or components . ” These results also indi - cate that inventors take more inventive risk with extremely familiar components . These results support Utterback’s argument and motivate further research . For example , are breakthroughs most likely when inventors combine very familiar components in new combinations ? If this were the case , then break - throughs would be most likely to emerge from social contexts that brought together inventors with deep experience in previously disparate ﬁelds . Such con - texts would also be more likely to be the technologi - cal source of potential future product life cycles and trajectories . Conclusion This paper developed and tested an explanation for the sources of purely technological uncertainty . It argued that the source of technological novelty and uncertainty lies within the combination of new com - ponents and new conﬁgurations of previously com - bined components . Inventors’ experimentation with new components and combinations leads to less suc - cess on average , but it also increases the variability that can lead to breakthroughs . Empirical results sup - ported the arguments with the exception that the use of more familiar components has a nonmonotonic and eventually positive effect on the uncertainty of inven - tion . In contrast to the nonmonotonic effect of com - ponent familiarity , the reﬁnement of previously used combinations has a negative and monotonic effect on uncertainty . Coupled with recent and complementary research regarding market inﬂuences ( Adner and Levinthal 2000 ) and formal economic models ( Klepper 1996 ) , this work helps us understand the causal forces that underlie the widely observed regularities of the prod - uct life cycle . The data and methods presented here also provide a strong basis for further investigations into the sources of invention and technological uncer - tainty . Most importantly , negative binomial count and dispersion models enable researchers to analyze the ﬁrst and second moments of patent citation data . Such models will enable us to move beyond basic counts in analysis of patent data and quantitatively ana - lyze the outliers of the highly skewed distributions of inventive trials . Such tools can enable more formal analysis of breakthrough inventions , heretofore , “the domain of economic historians” ( Scherer and Harhoff 2000 ) . For example , the classic controversy about the sources of technological breakthroughs , whether they emerge from smaller , entrepreneurial , and “outside” ﬁrms ( Schumpeter 1939 , Marquis 1969 , Klein 1977 ) , or large , industrial incumbents ( Schumpeter 1942 ) , can be reconsidered with these data and methods . The approach presented here also has application beyond the study of technology and patents , mainly that we should think of varying variance as an opportunity instead of a nuisance . Future work should also investigate the relation - ships between invention as a recombinant search pro - cess and other literatures such as integrality , coupling , and modularity ( Ulrich 1995 ) , complex systems ( Kauffman 1993 ) , modular operators ( Baldwin and Clark 1999 , Goldenberg et al . 1999 ) , the evolution of modular design choices ( Simon 1996 ) , and the market implications of such issues ( Christensen and Verlinden 2000 ) . For example , interdependence between compo - nents should increase inventive uncertainty and mod - ularity should decrease it . Kauffman’s ( 1993 ) models of search over interdependent landscapes also imply a positive but nonmonotonic effect on the mean . Con - ceptualizing technological invention as search over interdependent landscapes implies a complexity catas - trophe in technological evolution , as inventors face greater numbers of components and greater interde - pendence between them ( Fleming and Sorenson 2001 ) . Inventors are not blind search agents , however , and their search strategies will differ greatly and pre - sumably be more effective than genetic recombination ( Gavetti and Levinthal 2000 , Rivkin 2000 ) . The work has strategic implications as well . Organi - zations that seek technological breakthroughs should experiment with new combinations , possibly with 130 Management Science / Vol . 47 , No . 1 , January 2001 D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 157 . 182 . 150 . 22 ] on 16 A p r il 2015 , a t 08 : 52 .

They do so , however , at the risk of an increased number of failures . If invention is indeed a partially blind search process , such fail - ures are to some extent unavoidable . Simple port - folio strategies are unfortunately not the complete answer , because of the extreme skew of inventive distributions . Although the overall variance of such distributions decreases with an increasing number of trials , ﬁrms—and indeed , as Scherer and Harhoff ( 2000 ) demonstrate—entire economies cannot antici - pate completely stable returns . There might exist orga - nizational mechanisms that encourage recombinant exploration , while limiting the downside of increased failures . For example , ﬁrms that can screen or test their nascent inventions more effectively will bene - ﬁt more and should increase the variability of their inventive trials . The recent progress in drug design as a result of automated screening processes provides a salient example ( Amato 1999 ) . Finally , science should enlighten and shorten technological search over difﬁ - cult landscapes . Science can either motivate recombi - nant search across particular technological landscapes , or aid in search across landscapes that inventors have discovered empirically .
