As a possible paradigm in virtual reality technologies , haptic feedback offers the designers an approach for enhancing the traditional input - based method used in Computer - Aided Design ( CAD ) system . Users can interact with 3D objects in the virtual environment and at the same time be able to have the tactile sensation during the design process . Moreover , such interface offers the designers a human - in - the - loop methodology where they are able interact with virtual prototypes modeled in the application environment . In the thesis , we developed two preliminary HAD environments to validate the integration of the haptic device with CAD system . In both of these environments , users are able to feel the force of simulated devices and intuitively modify design parameters through interaction with force feedback device . In order to evaluate the feasibility of proposed HAD interfaces , we conducted informal user studies where participants are asked to explore discretized design space of virtual prototypes . The experimental results suggest that these virtual prototypes integrated with haptic features can facilitate product development and may have great potential in future virtual reality design environment .

Introduction This chapter briefly introduces the latest application of the haptic device in simulation , medical training and industrial - level software . After reviewing these applications , we propose a new design procedure that integrates haptic rendering with computer - aided design . With this new design concept , the cost of physical prototypes is greatly reduced ; additional benefits will be discussed in later chapters . 1 . 1 . Motivations Modern industrial design is the combination of applied art and applied science to improve the aesthetics , ergonomics , functionality and usability of a product . Different products may have various design processes . However , all of them share some features in common , such as user experience design , sketching , product research , model making and prototype testing . To speed each process and unite them more efficiently , a technology called virtual reality ( VR ) has been developed . A VR system is a tool to extract visual information from a product , which allows designers to create , evaluate and revise the model with ease , establishing a fast communication network among various manufacturing departments . Over the past thirty years , virtualization of the design and manufacturing process has already shown its great value in modern industry design : such as improving the efficiency and the competitive strength of industry [ 32 ] [ 33 ] [ 34 ] . One of the most commonly known VR technologies is the computer - aided design ( CAD ) system . This matured technology has released designers from the heavy work of drafting , which used to be done manually . It not only provides absolute accuracy and protection of the documents but also offers a level of user - friendly interface for designers . However , current CAD software has some limitation in simulating the contact force between humans and products due to the uncertainty of human behavior . For example , without the support from ergonomic group , one can hardly distinguish human reactions to different models of product . To obtain direct user feedback in the early 2 evaluation stage , an ergonomic study is conducted , inviting users to experiment on different sets of prototypes . The prototype used here is called the proof - of - principle prototype . In the traditional method , a large number of physical prototypes are needed to support this dedicated research , but such prototypes are often not yet available due to the lack of manufacturing details . A solution is required to speed the process of user experience evaluation in model verification phase and lower the cost of prototyping in product user research stage . One approach to solve these problems is to implement a technology called rapid prototyping ( RP ) [ 3 ] . Designers convert the CAD model to a standard format such as stereolithography ( STL ) . Then these machines use additive method to build the prototype layer by layer with sliced digital information . This technology has greatly shortened the time of prototype and lower the cost of material used in manufacturing process ; however , RP is still in the developing stage [ 4 ] , and its limitations could be : a ) most materials used in RP are proprietary plastic ; b ) Research on expansion to other materials such as alloys and metals has reached a plateau . Although the price of 3D printers using polymer has dropped substantially over the past few years , machines using direct metal laser sintering ( DMSL ) or selective laser sintering ( SLS ) are still very expensive . They usually cost more than $ 500 , 000 which makes them only affordable to large automobile companies [ 3 ] . On the other hand , these machines using laser sintering technology are also difficult to be maintained or repaired and usually require specific work environment which provides anti - toxicity and dustproof measures . An alternative means for facilitating the ergonomic study is to apply a virtual prototype between the real prototype and modeling stages ( figure 1 . 1 ) . Compared to the physical prototypes , virtual prototypes have fewer product details but greatly aid in saving manufacturing costs and assembly time [ 2 ] . Through an intuitive user interface , engineers can explore specific variable combinations related to human factors with greater flexibility than the traditional method . Engineers can also benefit from the active feedback collected from user studies , which can help them to verify the model during the early design stage while the physical prototype is not yet available . 3 Figure 1 . 1 : Conceptual paradigm of evolution from model to product ; the area represents product details . However , it usually takes long time for common users to accept any undeveloped technologies . Current haptic devices are still in developing stage and have great limitation in features such as maximum output force and workspace size . The maximum force of a haptic device is typically under 20N ( APPX . A ) which can be a problem when we render some high stiffness virtual objects . On the other hand , most haptic devices are not aimed for industrial design . The limited workspace is suitable for medical simulation where the motion of operator is small and only involves wrist and finger movement , but it could be a problem when we conduct haptic simulation in other area like mechanical structure design , which usually requires whole arm motion . In the thesis , we reviewed and compared various haptic devices currently available . For overall consideration , we compared features like the maximum force , workspace and price in chapter two and find Novint Falcon device is ideal for personal use . Inspired by the idea of virtual prototyping , we proposed a new complementary design paradigm called the haptic aided design ( HAD ) , which integrates the force feedback device into a CAD system to simulate the virtual prototypes used in the early stage of product design . This multimodal system with haptic feature offers users active feedback from human interaction and provide alternative to traditional modeling product real prototype virtual prototype model 4 procedure . In the thesis , we developed two preliminary HAD platforms to demonstrate feasibility of proposed design process . 1 . 2 . Literature Review Haptic technology , or haptic , has been identified as both a technology facilitator and a technology provider . As one branch of VR technology , the haptic system has already been applied in various fields such as aerospace , automotive and medical training . It is considered one of the most important components in future VR systems . In this section , we mainly review the current state of several research fields related to needle insertion simulator and haptic aided design . Section 1 . 2 . 1 lists the applications used in medical training and simulation . Section 1 . 2 . 2 describes the latest development of haptic aided design in three different areas . Work related to the medical training environment can be found in chapters 4 , where a preliminary needle insertion training environment was proposed . The haptic aided design concepts are also illustrated in detail in chapter 4 . Two case studies are conducted to support the validation of haptic aided design in different perspectives . 1 . 2 . 1 . Haptic Application in Medical Training and Simulation Medical error has always been a big concern in the public health care industry . According to the official report from the state administration of work safety , in China alone , more than 50 , 000 patients have died each year from medical errors [ 54 ] . The actual number of victims may be larger due to the self - reporting system . According to another report [ 13 ] regarding medical error in the United States , medical accidents in 2008 cost the US government more than 8 billion dollars . These tragedies quickly draw public attention to the current surgeon training platform . The traditional training system for surgeons requires much guided practice on animals or cadavers before surgeons are allowed to operate on living humans . However , practice on animals is not ideal due to the differences in organs temperature , blood pressure and tissue stiffness . Cadaver tests may be more accurate , but each cadaver can be used only once ; the concern for ethical issues is another reason for seeking alternative methods . Moreover , much 5 practice is need for a senior surgeon to maintain his or her skills . For example , in the case of amniocentesis operation which is used for prenatal diagnosis , the lack of practice after training may double the risk of fatal operations , according to the clinical data collected in previous work [ 12 ] . Another report on amniocentesis training [ 14 ] states that in order to maintain good performance during operation , surgeons should perform at least 50 amniocenteses each year , and a clinic unit should perform at least 500 per year . However , for clinics located in under - populated areas , it is not practical or even possible to find so many patients for the purpose of practicing . One solution to the problem stated above is to implement VR technology into medical training . Virtual reality has already shown its value in the medical training system by allowing trainees to manipulate tools , identify organs and feel the various kinds of reaction force between tools and simulated virtual objects . The advantage of virtual medical training is discussed extensively in the paper [ 11 ] . With the help of the proper haptic device and an augmented visual interface , apprentices can practice on a virtual patient without dedicated guidance from an expert and can also access uncommon and critical cases during their field training . Some fully developed applications of medical simulators include needle insertion , laparoscopy , palpation , endoscopy and arthroscopy . Previously developed simulators can be found in these works [ 15 ] ~ [ 20 ] . Magill and Anderson developed a 2D needle insertion simulator used to simulate the epidural needle insertion procedure . The main advantage of this prototype is integration of the physical model with software simulation , adding the palpation feature before epidural procedure . The limitation of this platform is lack of degree of freedom because it allows motion only in a fixed plane . B . Gonenc and H . Gurocak [ 16 ] developed a hybrid system that integrates needle insertion and scissor cutting in a compact interface . In this application , the author proposed a novel hybrid actuator that reduces the size of the simulator . This haptic platform can be used to render very high stiffness tissues such as bones and tendons . 6 Asadian and Kermani [ 18 ] proposed an estimation - based algorithm to build a needle insertion force model with a 5 - DOF manipulator . A 6 - DOF force sensor and a 5 - DOF position sensor are embedded into the needle shaft . This method utilizes multiple Kalman filters to estimate the control parameters online . The numerical iterative approach enables force evolution during the insertion procedure ; information about needle and tissue properties is not required in this model . One successful commercialized needle insertion platform is the Mediseus® Epidural Simulator ( figure 1 . 2 ) invented by Ross Horley . This platform is actually one of the applications of the SensAble PHANTOM Omni device . The author embeds a PHANTOM Omni device in a box and adapts the 3 - DOF force rendering end effector into a syringe manipulator , which has one translational and two rotary DOFs . Figure 1 . 2 : The Mediceus Epidural simulator [ 1 ] 1 . 2 . 2 . Haptic Aided Design Haptic aided design , as a part of virtual reality aided design , dates back to the early ’90s . This technology first drew the attention of large automotive companies [ 19 ] [ 38 ] [ 39 ] , who combine virtual realities with a haptic interface to produce a hybrid seating buck for ergonomic experiments . By replacing the less important variables with haptic components , companies can significantly reduce the cost of experiments and the time of assembly and disassembly . Although haptic aided design requires massive investment in software in the early stage , this technology is still widely embraced by the automotive industry for its overall economic value . However , most of these applications are impulsive and lack commonalities . Researchers of product engineering stated that these individual researches focused on specific cases instead of long - term vision [ 9 ] , 7 and most platforms are bulky and not applicable to small companies for more general application . With the emergence of various compact haptic devices in the early 20th century , computer - aided tools have been increasingly integrated with haptic units . SensAble launched its first commercialized 3D mouse tool - kit Freeform ® system in 2009 [ 1 ] . The Freeform system combines the Phantom series with CAD and computer aided manufacturing ( CAM ) tools , allowing users to explore in a 3D virtual environment and quickly establish complex sculpting models . It has proven helpful in bridging the gap between conventional CAD software and complex 3D sculpting and organic shapes . Designers can quickly trace the contours and add details with the Phantom joystick in 3D sculpting instead of building plots in the NURBS environment with a 2D input device . Another important application of haptic aided design is virtual assembly . The vision of virtual assembly is regarded as an extension of virtual reality aided design , and it was first proposed and studied systematically in the early 1990s . Jayaram [ 17 ] summarized the VR technologies that might be used in virtual assembly , validating this new development by listing the benefits to companies and designers : they shorten the design circle , offer an alternative design method at the early stage , reduce design expenses and so forth . Antonino [ 20 ] presented a detailed virtual assembly and maintenance process in 1999 . In the work , Antonino conducted an experiment to verify the application of virtual assembly . At this preliminary stage , lack of haptic feedback is a major problem , so the author used data gloves with tactile feedback to represent the collisions and “click force” in the assembly process . Much effort has been directed to integrating this technology with the new haptic devices booming in the early 21st century . Mishra and Suresh [ 18 ] reviewed the computation methods used in thin object simulation , and they proposed a dual representation algorithm to reduce the computation burden while also guaranteeing accuracy of simulation . The force feedback device they used in the case study is Novint Falcon , which is currently the most economic haptic system available . The dual representation algorithm is convenient to be adopted by other system and can be further utilized in beam and shell simulation . Simon Fraser University has also researched HAD integrations on Phantom Omni device . Zhang Jian and Payandeh [ 21 ] from Experimental Robotics Laboratory 8 proposed a novel HAD interface for mechanism design . In their application , users can intuitively change the parameters of a 4 - bar mechanism which is used to facilitate the amniocentesis procedure ; users can identify the best variables combination among various designs without mathematical optimizations . 1 . 3 . Objectives The main objective of the thesis is to illustrate and validate the HAD process on low cost platform Novint Falcon device . One of the main objectives of the research is to enhance the transparency of haptic rendering . In the thesis , we use software based gravity compensation to cancel the gravity effect at the grip ( end - effector ) . We first overview the source code of libralis library and then revise the interpolation algorithm applied to the points outside the cubic grid created by libralis . This new algorithm is termed as point - cloud based interpolation and it requires determining if the new created points lie inside the haptic workspace , so we analyze the configuration of Novint Falcon device and give inverse kinematics to calculate the joints angle with the position at the end - effector . If all joints are working in their range of motion , then the new point is added to the library for further use . As the most important objective of the thesis work , we propose two preliminary HAD interfaces to validate the integration of haptic device with CAD environment . In the first case study , we build a needle insertion interface which is used to simulate the axial force during the needle insertion process . Based on the haptic frame above we develop a multimodal design interface where human operators can manipulate the virtual slider - crank mechanism used for facilitating the needle insertion procedure . Users can intuitively change the parameters of the mechanism structure and find out the best combination through a user study . In the second case study , we simulate the opening and closing force of a refrigerator door . The feedback from users helps designers better understand the system and exclude the less important parameters to human factors in early design stage . This human - in - the - loop ( HITL ) methodology allows users to model haptic force feedback without collecting and analyzing the raw data from real prototypes testing . 9 1 . 4 . Contributions The contributions of the thesis are summarized as follows : Point - cloud - based gravity compensation . Preliminary test was conducted on the gravity compensation software libralis . The experiments show the libralis has poor performance at the boundary of haptic workspace . In order to solve this problem , we proposed a novel point - cloud - based interpolation procedure . Unlike the vertex creation method used in libralis , the vertices generated by new method can almost contain the whole workspace of Novint Falcon device . However , for simplicity and efficiency of the application , we only implement 4 points at each corner to eliminate the worst case scenario of the original libralis tests . Experiment result shows that the new method is sufficient to improve the performance of gravity compensation at the boundary condition . Establish a HAD interface to simulate the slider - crank mechanism with the Novint Falcon device . In this HAD environment , we build a multi - modal design interface where users can interact with virtual prototypes and feel the resistance force during the virtual needle insertion process . Users can intuitively explore the possible combination of mechanism parameters to minimize the overshoot of the needle insertion . We conduct users study to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed HAD interface . Simulate the opening and closing of a refrigerator door . As another example of a HAD application with the Novint Falcon device , we discussed the feasibility of using haptic device to assist designers developing and verifying the force model during the early stage of design . The HAD scenario is haptic force simulation of opening and closing a refrigerator door . Users can choose various force models and define parameters with the control panel . The interactable force model abstraction allows designers to exclude less important parameters and gradually obtain a realistic force model in an iterative process . It also allows designers to verify their assumptions and obtain better understanding of the force model . 10 1 . 5 . Thesis Organization The thesis is organized as follows : chapter 1 introduces the general motivation and objective of the thesis . Chapter 2 provides an overview of related work to the research . In this chapter we mainly discuss the structure of the Novint Falcon device . We give inverse kinematics of its parallel structure which can be used in the interpolation method proposed in chapter 3 . The objective of chapter 3 is to eliminate the gravity effect to enhance the transparency of haptic interface by using software based compensation method . In this chapter , we analyze the performance of libralis software and propose a new interpolation method to eliminate the free - play effect of the joystick at the workspace boundary . Chapter 4 presents the HAD interface as the main objective of the thesis . In this chapter , we establish two HAD interfaces . The multimodal interface used in case study one is to help users to design mechanical structure in an intuitive way . The second HAD interface focuses on demonstrating how HAD can simplify the model and verify our design at early stage . Chapter 5 concludes the research and discuss the future work . 11 2 . Background Material This chapter aims to present current commercial haptic devices used in industry and research institutions . Section 2 . 1 gives an overview of existing haptic devices . Section 2 . 2 analyzes the structure of parallel mechanism used in design of Novint Falcon . 2 . 1 . Haptic Force Feedback Device Over the past 20 years , the haptic device ( force feedback device ) has drawn great interest from industry and research institutions as a tool to improve VR system . Currently , there are a number of haptic devices for different research purposes and development . This section reviews the criteria for systematizing haptic devices and briefly discusses their current design challenges . One distinct difference among haptic interfaces is whether they are tactile feedback or kinesthetic . A tactile feedback device ( figure 2 . 1 ) stimulates the contact of the skin to create tactile sensations , while a kinesthetic device creates force field to guide or inhibit body movement . The design of a tactile device is usually challenging because the stimulation density needs to be high , which makes the device bulky and less portable . Also most current tactile device uses passive touch , which feels unnatural . Quite different from tactile display , the kinesthetic device offers point - based interactions . Users hold the end - effector and feel the force generated by the actuators ( figure 2 . 2 ) . The main challenge of the design of the kinesthetic device is limited workspace and stiffness . Device with sufficient quality can be very expensive . For example , segma . 7 from Force Dimension costs nearly $ 80 , 000 and the maintenance cost is over $ 3000 per year . Another challenge of the kinesthetic device is its bulky structure and it is usually constrained to flat surface such as a desk . 12 Figure 2 . 1 : Tactile haptic device , illustration of tactile feedback Figure 2 . 2 : Kinesthetic device Phantom Omni from SensAble [ 1 ] Haptic devices for kinesthetic feedback can be categorized as either impedance display or admittance display . The difference of these two displays can be illustrated by equations in s - domain : F ( s ) = Z ( s ) X ( s ) ( 2 . 1 ) X ( s ) = Y ( s ) F ( s ) ( 2 . 2 ) The impedance control reads the position and sends force . Equation 2 . 1 represents the impedance control loop , which can be simplified as “position in , force out” ; most haptic devices adopt this control frame because it is simpler to design and cheaper 13 to produce than the one with admittance display . Figure 2 . 3b shows the typical haptic device using impedance control . Admittance control measures the force applied by the user and moves the haptic device in proportion to that force . Equation 2 . 2 represents admittance display , which enables high - resolution , steady motion . It is also excellent to create a high - stiffness virtual wall . The haptic master device from Moog FCS ( figure 2 . 3 ( a ) ) is a typical admittance display device . The maximum output force can be up to 250N , which is much more force than necessary in most surgical simulations . Moog applied this device in its commercial dental burr drilling simulation system , where stiff contacts must be correctly simulated [ 10 ] . ( a ) ( b ) Figure 2 . 3 ( a ) Moog FCS Robotic haptic master using admittance display [ 63 ] ( b ) Omega - 3 from Force Dimension using impedance display [ 62 ] The mechanical structures used in kinesthetic haptic devices can be divided into serial , parallel and hybrid mechanisms . The serial mechanism includes a single serial chain which connects end - effector to the base . It usually has a larger workspace , but the inertia of the manipulator is high because some of the actuators are located on moving joints . On the other hand , the parallel mechanism consists at least two kinematic chains which connect a moving platform to a fixed platform . It offers higher stiffness and dynamic performances due to its closed structure . The disadvantages of 14 the parallel mechanism include a smaller workspace , complex forward kinematic equation and a lower dexterity due to multiplicity of singularities inside its workspace . ( a ) ( b ) Figure 2 . 4 : ( a ) Serial structure haptic device Phantom premium from SensAble [ 1 ] ( b ) Parallel structure haptic device Delta . 6 from Force Dimension [ 62 ] In order to combine the advantages of both mechanical features , researchers developed the hybrid system , which integrates the parallel structure with the serial mechanism to obtain a larger workspace and higher stiffness . Simon Fraser University has devoted great effort to building a hybrid haptic device . Figure 2 . 5 illustrates a hybrid system [ 53 ] from Experimental Robotics Laboratory , Simon Fraser University . This device consists of a spherical parallel mechanism and a serial mechanism ( figure 2 . 5b ) ; these form the 6 - DoF motion and force feedback in a large workspace . 15 ( a ) ( b ) Figure 2 . 5 : ( a ) Prototype of serial / parallel 6DoF haptic device [ 53 ] ; ( b ) kinematic model of hybrid serial / parallel haptic device . 2 . 2 . Analysis of the Novint Falcon Structure In this section , we mainly discuss the kinematics of Novint Falcon device . Most works in this section are used to determine if a point lies inside the haptic workspace , which is the key procedure to the interpolation method proposed in chapter 3 . First we need to find out the mapping from haptic coordinate system to base coordinate system . In order to find this transformation , we use forward kinematics to calculate the position of end - effector in base frame when it stays at original point of haptic workspace ( this can be achieved by applying a virtual fixture at the original point ) . From the result , we get the transformation matrix from haptic frame to base coordinates frame . Given a point in haptic workspace , we can determine if it is reachable by the end - effector with three steps : ( 1 ) transform the position vector obtained from application to the base frame ; ( 2 ) transform the position vector to each reference frames attached to the limbs ; ( 3 ) use inverse kinematics to calculate joints angles of each limb . If all joints work in their range , then the point is reachable by the haptic device . 16 2 . 2 . 1 . Kinematic Configuration and Geometric Parameters The haptic device used in this thesis is the Novint Falcon ; it is based on the Delta - 3 robot configuration proposed by Thai [ 7 ] , where the end - effector has 3 translational DOFs . It is quite similar to the delta robot introduced by Clavel in 1987 [ 44 ] [ 45 ] , but Novint Falcon replaced the spherical joints with single DOF rotary joints to reduce the manufacturing cost of the robot . Figure 2 . 6 : Prototype and CAD model generated by the author of Novint Falcon [ 6 ] The Novint Falcon is actuated by three Mabuchi RS - 555PH - 15280 actuators that are monitored by a coaxial 4 - state encoder with 320 lines per revolution ( Appx . B ) . The torque is transmitted with a tensioned cable whose torque transmission ratio is as high as 7 . 62 : 1 [ 47 ] . The use of a cable instead of a gear system allows for very low friction and a low maintenance cost . The moving platform is linked to the base by three identical parallel limbs ( figure 2 . 7 ) . Each limb consists of a forearm and an upper arm . The forearm is a single link , illustrated in figure 2 . 7 . The upper arm consists of a planar 4 - bar parallelogram . The axes of rotation of each parallelogram are parallel to each other , and the lengths of its opposite links are equal to each other . In the thesis , view from front of Novint Falcon , we label three limbs as limb 1 , 2 , 3 ( the top most is limb 1 followed by limb 2 and 3 in clockwise ) . 17 Figure 2 . 7 : Front - view sketch of the parallel structure of the Delta - 3 robot proposed by Thai [ 7 ] Novint Falcon was created mainly for the gaming industry ; the Novint Company has provided very little information about modeling and control parameters for research purposes . In Ouellet and Hillier’s work [ 47 ] [ 48 ] , they gave some geometric features of Novint Falcon device , such as the dimensions of the links ( table 2 . 1 ) and inertial and actuation properties . The internal hardware list is also released in their work . 2 . 2 . 2 . Inverse Kinematics Inverse kinematics studies the mapping from Cartesian coordinates of the end effector to the set of joint angles at the actuators . Given the position of the moving platform , which is point P at the center of the end - effector , we calculate the possible solution of joint angles for each leg ( 𝜃 1𝑖 𝜃 2𝑖 𝜃 3𝑖 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑖 𝑡ℎ 𝑏𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑐ℎ ) . In order to clarify the coordinate transformation matrices in this section , first we need to introduce the coordinate systems used in the transformation : 18 ( 1 ) Haptic frame , { H } . Point P is located at the center of end - effector . The position of point P obtained from application is in this frame . { H } originates at the point defined by Novint application ( figure 2 . 8 ) , but the exact location of the origin of { H } in the global frame is unknown and needs to be estimated . Figure 2 . 8 : CAD model generated by NX ( Unigraphics ) software . ( 2 ) Base frame , { B } . { B } is attached to the base at point O , which is the center of the fixed platform ( figure 2 . 8 ) . The U and V axes lie in the plane defined by three axes of actuated joints ( figure 2 . 9 ) . 19 Figure 2 . 9 : Diagram of base frame and reference frames attached to the actuated joints . ( 3 ) Limb reference frames ( figure 2 . 9 ) , { Ti } . { Ti } is the reference frame attached to the fixed platform at the point Ai for branch i , where Ai is located at the actuated joints . The Ui - axis is perpendicular to the axis of actuated joint at Ai , and at an angle 𝜙 𝑖 from the U - axis of frame { B } . The Vi - axis is along the axis of actuated joint . 20 Figure 2 . 10 : Geometric diagram of one branch of the device : point P locates at the center of end effector , and O is the original point of base frame located at the center of the fixed platform .

Thus the transformation of point P in the ( U 𝑖 V 𝑖 W 𝑖 ) coordinates attached to point A 𝑖 for leg i is as follows : [ 𝑝 𝑢𝑖 𝑝 𝑣𝑖 𝑝 𝑤𝑖 ] = [ cos ( 𝜙 𝑖 ) sin ( 𝜙 𝑖 ) 0 −sin ( 𝜙 𝑖 ) cos ( 𝜙 𝑖 ) 0 0 0 1 ] [ 𝑝 𝑢 𝑝 𝑣 𝑝 𝑤 ] + [ −𝑟𝑠0 ] ( 2 . 3 ) Calculating with linkage parameters , expressions for 𝑝 𝑢𝑖 , 𝑝 𝑣𝑖 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑝 𝑤𝑖 are given as follows : 𝑝 𝑢𝑖 = a cos ( 𝜃 1𝑖 ) − 𝑐 + [ 𝑑 + 𝑒 + 𝑏 𝑠𝑖𝑛 ( 𝜃 3𝑖 ) ] cos ( 𝜃 2𝑖 ) , ( 2 . 4 ) 𝑝 𝑣𝑖 = 𝑏 𝑐𝑜𝑠 ( 𝜃 3𝑖 ) + 𝑓 , ( 2 . 5 ) 𝑝 𝑤𝑖 = a sin ( 𝜃 1𝑖 ) + [ 𝑑 + 𝑒 + 𝑏 𝑠𝑖𝑛 ( 𝜃 3𝑖 ) ] sin ( 𝜃 2𝑖 ) , ( 2 . 6 ) Two solutions are found in equation ( 2 . 5 ) for 𝜃 3𝑖 : 𝜃 3𝑖 = ±arccos ( 𝑝 𝑣𝑖 −𝑓 𝑏 ) ( 2 . 7 ) For Novint Falcon , only a positive solution is considered , thus 𝜃 3𝑖 = arccos ( 𝑝 𝑣𝑖 −𝑓 𝑏 ) ( 2 . 8 ) With 𝜃 3𝑖 known , the square of equation ( 2 . 4 ) and ( 2 . 6 ) can be summed to eliminate 𝜃 2𝑖 through the Pythagorean relationship : ( 𝑝 𝑢𝑖 + c ) 2 + 𝑝 𝑤𝑖2 + 𝑎 2 − 2𝑎 ( 𝑝 𝑢𝑖 + 𝑐 ) cos ( 𝜃 1𝑖 ) − 2𝑎𝑝 𝑤𝑖 sin ( 𝜃 1𝑖 ) = ( 𝑑 + 𝑒 ) 2 + 2 ( 𝑑 + 𝑒 ) 𝑏𝑠𝑖𝑛 ( 𝜃 3𝑖 ) + 𝑏 2 sin 2 ( 𝜃 3𝑖 ) ( 2 . 9 ) To transform equation ( 2 . 9 ) into a polynomial expression , a half - angle tangent is defined as follows : 𝑡 1𝑖 = tan ( 𝜃 1𝑖 2 ) , ( 2 . 10 ) To produce the following relationship : 22 sin ( 𝜃 1𝑖 ) = 2𝑡 1𝑖 1 + 𝑡 1𝑖2 and cos ( 𝜃 1𝑖 ) = 1−𝑡 1𝑖2 1 + 𝑡 1𝑖2 ( 2 . 11 ) Substituting equation ( 2 . 11 ) into equation ( 2 . 9 ) , and simplifying the equation to produce the following : 𝑙 2𝑖 𝑡 1𝑖2 + 𝑙 1𝑖 𝑡 1𝑖 + 𝑙 0𝑖 = 0 , ( 2 . 12 ) Where : 𝑙 0𝑖 = 𝑝 𝑤𝑖2 + 𝑝 𝑢𝑖2 + 2𝑐𝑝 𝑢𝑖 − 2𝑎𝑝 𝑢𝑖 + 𝑎 2 + 𝑐 2 − 𝑑 2 − e 2 − 𝑏 2 sin ( 𝜃 3𝑖 ) 2 − 2𝑏𝑑 𝑠𝑖𝑛 ( 𝜃 3𝑖 ) − 2𝑏𝑒 𝑠𝑖𝑛 ( 𝜃 3𝑖 ) − 2𝑑𝑒 − 2𝑎𝑐 , ( 2 . 13 ) 𝑙 1𝑖 = −4𝑎𝑝 𝑤𝑖 , ( 2 . 14 ) 𝑙 2𝑖 = 𝑝 𝑤𝑖2 + 𝑝 𝑢𝑖2 + 2𝑐𝑝 𝑢𝑖 + 2𝑎𝑝 𝑢𝑖 + 𝑎 2 + 𝑐 2 − 𝑑 2 − e 2 − 𝑏 2 sin ( 𝜃 3𝑖 ) 2 − 2𝑏𝑑 𝑠𝑖𝑛 ( 𝜃 3𝑖 ) − 2𝑏𝑒 𝑠𝑖𝑛 ( 𝜃 3𝑖 ) − 2𝑑𝑒 + 2𝑎𝑐 , ( 2 . 15 ) From equation 2 . 12 , we get two possible solutions for 𝑡 1𝑖 : 𝑡 1𝑖 = −𝑙 1𝑖 ±√𝑙 1𝑖2 −4𝑙 0𝑖 𝑙 2𝑖 2𝑙 2𝑖 ( 2 . 16 ) For Novint Falcon , only one solution is possible due to the range of 𝜃 1𝑖 : 𝑡 1𝑖 = −𝑙 1𝑖 −√𝑙 1𝑖2 −4𝑙 0𝑖 𝑙 2𝑖 2𝑙 2𝑖 ( 2 . 17 ) Then we get 𝜃 1𝑖 = 2arctan ( 𝑡 1𝑖 ) ( 2 . 18 ) With 𝜃 1𝑖 and 𝜃 3𝑖 known , 𝜃 2𝑖 can be simply determined by equation ( 2 . 4 ) 𝜃 2𝑖 = arccos ( 𝑝 𝑢𝑖 −acos ( 𝜃 1𝑖 ) + 𝑐 𝑑 + 𝑒 + 𝑏𝑠𝑖𝑛 ( 𝜃 3𝑖 ) ) ( 2 . 19 ) 23 2 . 2 . 3 . Forward Kinematics Forward kinematics is used to calculate the end effector’s position given the actuators’ angle values . Unlike with the serial mechanism , analyzing forward kinematics of the parallel structure is usually more difficult than inverse kinematics problems due to the multiple possible solutions found in large polynomial equations . The kinematic analysis of the Delta - 3 robot has already been studied extensively in Stamper’s work [ 8 ] . Stamper used Sylvester’s Dialytic Elimination procedure [ 46 ] to eliminate unknowns from large systems of equations . The method yields 32 solutions to the polynomials with only 16 of them kinematically reachable without joint limits . Ouellet [ 48 ] used the numerical method to calculate a set of simultaneous equations produced by series of intersecting spheres , and this approximation method simplifies Novint Falcon to a special case of Delta - 3 robot , where the linkage parameters are d = e = 0 . 24 3 . Gravity Compensation In this chapter , we use estimation - based gravity compensation method to cancel the gravity effect on the Novint Falcon device . In section 3 . 1 , we discuss the merits and drawbacks of three different gravity compensation methods and the reason we use estimation - based approach . In section 3 . 2 , we introduce the basic control model and recursion rules used in libralis and discuss its limitation on Novint Falcon device . In section 3 . 3 , we proposed a novel interpolation method called point - cloud - based interpolation . In section 3 . 4 , we conducted experiments using various grids ; then we integrate point cloud interpolation method with libralis to enhance the boundary performance of the software . 3 . 1 . Problem Description The resultant force perceived by user during haptic interaction is determined by the force from actuators and gravity force from mechanical structure . The gravity force of parallel mechanism changes non - uniformly in the task space . In simulation , the fidelity refers to the degree to which a model reproduces the real state of the physical object . If we don’t cancel the gravity in our application , this nonlinear factor will possibly cause loss of transparency of haptic interface and eventually affect the fidelity of haptic rendering . Unfortunately , due to the complexity of parallel mechanisms , achieving a stable compensation is usually a difficult task , especially when we are conducting experiments on Novint Falcon , whose original point in the haptic workspace is obscure in the world coordinates system . A lot of effort has been done in the literature [ 40 ] , [ 41 ] , [ 42 ] , [ 43 ] to cancel the gravity effect . The techniques in these works can be presented in three categories : ( 1 ) A method that calculates the kinematics and dynamics of the robotic device and gives model - based gravity compensation directly . ( 2 ) A method that uses a force sensor at the end effector to cancel the gravity force online . ( 3 ) An 25 estimation - based approach , which measures the gravity value on pre - set points and use interpolation method to approximate the gravity force in the task space . ( a ) ( b ) Figure 3 . 1 : Gravity compensation . ( a ) Resultant force perceived by users before gravity compensation ; ( b ) resultant force after gravity compensation . The first method gives precise gravity compensation , but it has several drawbacks : One must disassemble the device and measure each part if the manufacturer doesn’t provide detailed product information . In addition , it is difficult for users to update the compensation value each time the end effector or orientation of the robot is changed . Moreover , Novint Falcon doesn’t have a calibration pinhole , as does the Phantom or Omega series ; we can only estimate the mapping from its joint - space to the world coordinates system , making it more difficult for users to apply the model - based gravity calculation . The second method uses a force sensor at the end effector , and it is restricted to admittance control rendering which is not suitable for the impedance - based haptic device . The final approach uses estimation - based methodology to calculate the gravity force along the workspace . The key idea of this method is to estimate the gravity value at each vertex and interpolate the gravity value within a cubic element formed by 8 vertices . This method has several advantages : ( 1 ) independent of kinematics and gives an estimated relationship between gravity force and position in the task space ; ( 2 ) suitable for device displaced with any orientation ; ( 3 ) straight - forward and easier for users to apply costumed end - effector . With these reasons , we decided to adopt the third method to cancel the gravity effect of Novint Falcon . In the thesis , we give gravity compensation using the libralis SDK which is widely used in 3 - DOFs haptic devices . 26 However , the cubic grid created by libralis cannot contain the entire workspace of Novint Falcon and the performance at the workspace boundary falls quickly due to the simplified interpolation method . More details about the limitation of libralis are given in section 3 . 2 . In order to solve these problems , a point - cloud - based interpolation scheme is proposed here to obtain more precise gravity compensation with the Novint Falcon device . In the following section , we will first explain the basic model and algorithm used in the libralis library . 3 . 2 . Background Material of Libralis 3 . 2 . 1 . Summary Libralis is cross - platform , open source software used to cancel the gravity effect [ 50 ] . The current version is compatible with all existing 3DOFs haptic devices . It implements an estimation - based algorithm to linearize the nonlinear relationship between the apparent gravity and the position of the end effector in the task space . 3 . 2 . 2 . Model and Control Algorithm If we don’t cancel the gravity force , the nonlinear dynamic model can be expressed as follows : F ( X , Ẋ ) = M ( X ) 𝑋̈ + G ( X ) ( 3 . 1 ) Where X is in the end effector position , note that M ( X ) ∈ ℝ 3×3 , X , F ( X ， 𝑋̇ ) and G ( X ) ∈ ℝ 3 . We use the PD controller here to estimate the apparent gravity force at position X . Assuming that the apparent gravity force is exactly known , the force from actuators can be written as follows : F ( X , Ẋ ) = K p ( X i − X ) − K d Ẋ + G ( X ) ( 3 . 2 ) where 𝐾 𝑝 and 𝐾 𝑑 are proportional and derivative gain matrices . Combining equation 3 . 1 and 3 . 2 yields the nonlinear dynamic system : 27 M ( X ) 𝑋̈ = K p ( X i − X ) − K d Ẋ ( 3 . 3 ) An approach [ 52 ] called feedback linearization can cancel the nonlinear factor in equation 3 . 3 by choosing suitable values for K p and K d : K p = 𝛽 M ( X ) ; K d = 𝛼M ( X ) ( 3 . 4 ) Substituting K p and K d in equation 3 . 3 and canceling the nonlinear parameter M ( X ) , we obtain a linear system : 𝑋̈ = 𝛽 ( X i − X ) − 𝛼Ẋ ( 3 . 5 ) The controller parameters 𝛼 and 𝛽 are chosen according to the raise time 𝑇 𝑠 and the overshoot 𝑝̂ . Given the parameter set 〈𝑇 𝑠 , 𝑝̂〉 , we can obtain the value of 𝛽 , as seen in figure 3 . 2 . Then we can select 𝛼 using the curves in figure 3 . 3 using the previously chosen 𝛽 and 𝑝̂ Figure 3 . 2 : The choice of parameter . The curves represent the relationship of T s and β , parameterized with several value of overshoot p̂ [ 51 ] 28 Figure 3 . 3 : The choice of parameter α . The curves represent the relationship of α and β , parameterized with several value of overshoot p̂ [ 51 ] As we can see from figure 3 . 2 and figure 3 . 3 , the parameters α and β determine the stability of PD controller and how fast it reaches a steady state . In this section , we assume the nonlinear terms G ( X ) , M ( X ) are known . Actually , these terms need to be determined by the recursion process described in the offline auto - calibration section . 3 . 2 . 3 . Offline Auto - calibration After the control parameters α and β are selected , we need create the grid which is used for gravity estimation in the offline auto - calibration phase . The libralis software allows us to define the grid dimensions and the length of each cubic unit . Figure 3 . 4 shows an example of the grid with 27 vertices . 29 Figure 3 . 4 : Grid with 27 interpolation points Contrary to the assumption we made above , the terms G ( X ) and M ( X ) are unknown here and are replaced with their estimates Ĝ ( X ) and M̂ ( X ) . We update the value of Ĝ ( X ) and M̂ ( X ) during the iterative procedure . The entire estimation process is illustrated by the flow diagram in figure 3 . 5 . Figure 3 . 5 : Flow diagram of the offline auto - calibration [ 51 ] 30 First , we need to define the initial condition of the first vertex 𝑋 0 . 𝐺̂ 0 ( 𝑋 0 ) = [ 0 , 0 , 0 ] 𝑇 , 𝑀̂ 0 ( 𝑋 0 ) = 𝐾 𝑑 ( 0 , 0 ) = 𝐾 𝑝 ( 0 , 0 ) = [ ∅ ] 3×3 Using the PD controller we introduced in section 3 . 2 . 2 , we apply an initialization loop to move the end effector from the start point 𝑋 𝑠 ( randomly chosen by user ) to the first grid vertex 𝑋 0 . At the 𝑘 𝑡ℎ iteration of the initialization loop , the force applied to the end - effector is computed as follows : 𝐹 𝑘 ( 𝑋 , 𝑋 ̇ ) = 𝐾 𝑝 ( 0 , 𝑘 ) ( 𝑋 0 − 𝑋 ) − 𝐾 𝑑 ( 0 , 𝑘 ) 𝑋 ̇ With increment of 𝛿 which is defined by users , we gradually increase the apparent mass : 𝑀̂ 𝑘 ( 𝑋 0 ) = 𝑀̂ 𝑘−1 ( 𝑋 0 ) + 𝛿𝐼 With equation ( 3 . 4 ) , we update the value of 𝐾 𝑝 and 𝐾 𝑑 at the 𝑘 𝑡ℎ iteration : 𝐾 𝑝 ( 0 , 𝑘 ) = 𝛽𝑀̂ 𝑘 ( 𝑋 0 ) 𝐾 𝑑 ( 0 , 𝑘 ) = 𝛼𝑀̂ 𝑘 ( 𝑋 0 ) We stop the initialization loop and replace it with the following recursion rules when | 𝑋 0 − 𝑋 | ≤ 𝜆 | 𝑋 0 − 𝑋 𝑠 | , where 𝜆 is a user - defined parameter used to control the initialization loop end . { 𝐹 𝑗 ( 𝑋 , 𝑋̇ ) = 𝐾 𝑝 ( 𝑖 , 𝑗 ) ( 𝑋 𝑖 − 𝑋 ) − 𝐾 𝑑 ( 𝑖 , 𝑗 ) 𝑋̇ + 𝐺̂ 𝑗 ( 𝑋 𝑖 ) 𝐺̂ 𝑗 + 1 ( 𝑋 𝑖 ) = 𝐾 𝑝 ( 𝑖 , 𝑗 ) ( 𝑋 𝑖 − 𝑋 ) + 𝐺̂ 𝑗 ( 𝑋 𝑖 ) 𝐾 𝑝 ( 𝑖 , 𝑗 + 1 ) = 𝛽𝑀̂ 𝑗 ( 𝑋 𝑖 ) 𝐾 𝑑 ( 𝑖 , 𝑗 + 1 ) = 𝛼𝑀̂ 𝑗 ( 𝑋 𝑖 ) 𝑀̂ 𝑗 ( 𝑋 𝑖 ) = ‖𝐺̂ 𝑗 ( 𝑋 𝑖 ) ‖ 𝑔 𝐼 where i , j means the 𝑗 𝑡ℎ iteration at vertex 𝑋 𝑖 . The stop condition is satisfied for vertex i when : 31 ‖𝐺̂ 𝑗 ( 𝑋 𝑖 ) − 𝐺̅ 𝑛𝐺 ‖ ≤ 𝜀 𝐺 In above relationship , 𝐺̅ 𝑛𝐺 is the average value over 𝑛 𝐺 samples . The iteration will stop when 𝑛 𝐺 consecutive samples fall in a sphere of radius 𝜀 𝐺 . Note that 𝑛 𝐺 and 𝜀 𝐺 are user - defined parameters . When the iteration at vertex i completes , we move to the next vertex , which is i + 1 , and a new initialization loop starts . 3 . 2 . 4 . Online Gravity Compensation Libralis uses trilinear interpolation within a cubic grid to compute the compensation term at point P . If point P lies inside the grid , we need to find the cube that contains point P and use the following equation to calculate the gravity online : Let ( 𝑥 𝑝 , 𝑦 𝑝 , 𝑧 𝑝 ) be the coordinates of point P , which is inside the grid , and ( 𝑥 𝑘 , 𝑦 𝑘 , 𝑧 𝑘 ) be the vertex of the active cube having minimum coordinates ( figure 3 . 6 ) which is located at the back - bottom - left corner of the cube ( figure 3 . 5 ) . The interpolation coefficients are computed as follows : { 𝑏 = 1 𝑙 𝑐 ( 𝑥 𝑝 − 𝑥 𝑘 ) 𝑎 = 1 𝑙 𝑐 ( 𝑙 𝑐 − 𝑏 ) 𝑑 = 1 𝑙 𝑐 ( 𝑦 𝑝 − 𝑦 𝑘 ) 𝑐 = 1 𝑙 𝑐 ( 𝑙 𝑐 − 𝑑 ) 𝑓 = 1 𝑙 𝑐 ( 𝑧 𝑝 − 𝑧 𝑘 ) 𝑒 = 1 𝑙 𝑐 ( 𝑙 𝑐 − 𝑓 ) Figure 3 . 6 : The cube which contains the current point P . 32 The gravity terms estimated at each vertex of an active cube can be represented by G 0 ~ G 7 ∈ ℝ 3 , and then the compensation term at point P is computed as follows : G ( P ) = [ 𝑒 𝑐 𝑎 G 0 + 𝑒 𝑐 𝑏 G 1 + 𝑒 𝑑 𝑎 G 2 + 𝑒 𝑑 𝑏 G 3 + 𝑓 𝑐 𝑎 G 4 + 𝑓 𝑐 𝑏 G 5 + 𝑓 𝑑 𝑎 G 6 + 𝑓 𝑑 𝑏 G 7 ] If point P lies outside the grid , it is mapped onto the nearest point 𝑃̂ ( 𝑥̃ 𝑝 , 𝑦̃ 𝑝 , 𝑧̃ 𝑝 ) on the grid boundary ( figure 3 . 7 ) . We assume that point Q ( 𝑞 𝑥 , 𝑞 𝑦 , 𝑞 𝑧 ) is the center of the grid and 𝑙 𝑥 , 𝑙 𝑦 , 𝑙 𝑧 be the side length of the grid along axes x , y and z . Then the coordinates are computed as follows : { 𝑥̃ 𝑝 = 𝑞 𝑥 + 𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛 ( 𝑥 𝑝 − 𝑞 𝑥 ) 𝑙 𝑥 2 𝑦̃ 𝑝 = 𝑞 𝑦 + 𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛 ( 𝑦 𝑝 − 𝑞 𝑦 ) 𝑙 𝑦 2 𝑧̃ 𝑝 = 𝑞 𝑧 + 𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛 ( 𝑧 𝑝 − 𝑞 𝑧 ) 𝑙 𝑧 2 Figure 3 . 7 : Figure illustrates the mapping on the grid boundary if the point P lies outside the grid 33 3 . 3 . Point - cloud - based Gravity Estimation 3 . 3 . 1 . Limitation of Libralis We noted in previous sections that the grid created by libralis doesn’t contain the entire workspace of the Novint falcon device . Actually , according to the workspace analysis done by Hiller [ 47 ] , the estimated volume of Novint Falcon’ workspace is 7 . 9 × 10 −5 𝑚 3 , therefore the maximum cubic grid created by libralis ( 40X40X40 𝑚𝑚 3 ) only takes up about 80 % of the total reachable workspace . We witnessed unstableness of the system when we increase the maximum cubic grid defined by libralis . This can be explained by fact that the performance of haptic device deteriorates quickly when the end - effector is near the workspace boundary ; The PD controllers used for moving the end - effector and estimating the gravity values may be affected by such deterioration . Moreover , if some of the vertices exceed the workspace boundary , offline auto - calibration usually ends up in an infinite loop . The nature of a parallel mechanism workspace determines that the normal grid creation method has limitation in improving the performance of gravity compensation . We need a more flexible vertex creation method that can contain as much workspace as possible . In the thesis we propose a novel interpolation method called point - cloud - based gravity compensation . In the following sections , the process of vertex creation and the scheme of the interpolation will be discussed in details . 3 . 3 . 2 . Creating Point Cloud The new method to create the vertices is quite different from the grid creation process in libralis . We start from the original point of the workspace and create new vertices in six directions ( x , - x , y , - y , z , - z ) in Cartesian coordinate system with distance P . After we have created the vertices , we check whether they are already recorded in the points file and whether the new vertices are within the reachable workspace . The schematic in Appx . D shows how to determine if the current point lies inside the workspace . If the vertex exceeds the workspace boundary , we replace it with a new vertex using length λP , where λ is a user - defined parameter ( 0 . 5 < λ < 1 ) , and P is the original distance ( figure 3 . 8 ) . 34 Figure 3 . 8 : vertices creation process viewed from 2D ; if new vertex exceeds the workspace boundary , it will be replaced with one with λP distance to the previous vertex . The vertices used for searching for the new vertices in the next loop are marked with a circle . If the vertex is still outside the workspace , we multiply the current distance by λ and check the boundary condition again . This procedure is repeated until the new vertex falls within the workspace . No more extensions will be applied to the points that were created by the distance 𝜆 𝑛 𝑃 ( n > 0 ) because these points are too close to workspace boundary . We assume these points plot the approximate boundary of the haptic workspace . The total number of vertices in the point cloud is determined by 𝜆 and P , where smaller 𝜆 and P yields more vertices . The detailed scheme of the point cloud creation can be illustrated in the following flow diagram ( figure 3 . 9 ) . Note that in order to make the points distribution more uniform along the workspace , we rank the new points according to when they are recorded and follow the “first come , first serve basis” . The interpolation points can also be added manually , if there are special requirements . 35 Figure 3 . 9 : Conceptual diagram of point cloud creation ; point marked with flag = 1 is used to search for new vertices in the next loop . 36 3 . 3 . 3 . Interpolation Scheme A tri - linear interpolation is applied within a tetrahedron ( figure 3 . 10 ) . First we calculate the distance between the current point and each vertex in the point cloud and record the four nearest points . If these points are not in the same plane , we create a tetrahedron , used to calculate the gravity force at the end effector . Figure 3 . 10 : Trilinear interpolation within a tetrahedron 3 . 3 . 4 . Interpolation Algorithm Assume the gravity changes uniformly inside the current tetrahedron . Therefore , the gravity can be represented by the following equation : G = 𝐴𝑋 + 𝐵𝑌 + 𝐶𝑍 + 𝐷 ( 3 . 6 ) Let 𝐺 0 , 𝐺 1 , 𝐺 2 , 𝐺 3 be the apparent gravity of the four points nearest to the current end effector . Thus , the relationship can be written in the matrix form : [ 𝑋 0 𝑌 0 𝑋 1 𝑌 1 𝑍 0 1 𝑍 1 1 𝑋 2 𝑌 2 𝑋 3 𝑌 3 𝑍 2 1 𝑍 3 1 ] [ 𝐴𝐵𝐶𝐷 ] = [ 𝐺 0 𝐺 1 𝐺 2 𝐺 3 ] By inverting the matrix , the system of equations can be solved for A , B , C and D : [ 𝐴𝐵 𝐶 𝐷 ] = [ 𝑋 0 𝑌 0 𝑋 1 𝑌 1 𝑍 0 1 𝑍 1 1 𝑋 2 𝑌 2 𝑋 3 𝑌 3 𝑍 2 1 𝑍 3 1 ] −𝟏 [ 𝐺 0 𝐺 1 𝐺 2 𝐺 3 ] 37 Note that the four points cannot be coplanar , if they are , the inversion is not applicable . With A , B , C , D known , then the gravity force at end effector can be approximated with equation ( 3 . 6 ) . 3 . 3 . 5 . Integration of Point - cloud - based Interpolation with Libralis Point cloud interpolation has many advantages over the one used in libralis as we discussed in previous sections : ( 1 ) It shows higher precision at the boundary because it contains more workspace volume than libralis does ; ( 2 ) It is more flexible because users can manually add points if they want to enhance the precision at a desired area . However , this interpolation algorithm and the searching scheme consume more CPU time than libralis does . Table 3 . 1 compares the math operations used in each interpolation . Table 3 . 1 Math operation counts in each interpolation method Operation + / − × / ÷ Libralis method 13 30 Point cloud method 106 264 Considering the real - time gravity compensation is usually integrated with other haptic rendering codes , the online interpolation algorithm must be as fast as possible to avoid competing for CPU time with main haptic frame and graphic frame . In order to combine the merits from both algorithms , an integrated scheme is proposed and various experiments are conducted in section 3 . 4 to determine the parameters of grid . We decide to integrate the new interpolation method with libralis for the following reasons : ( 1 ) From the discussion above , the online interpolation algorithm used in libralis is faster than the method we proposed in section 3 . 3 . 4 ; the experiment in section 3 . 4 suggests libralis has satisfactory performance when the end - effector lies inside the grid created by libralis . 38 ( 2 ) The performance of gravity compensation using libralis deteriorates quickly when the end - effector moves out of the grid . The experiment in section 3 . 4 . 2 shows the performance of libralis on three kinds of points lying outside of the grid . The result suggests we must re - interpolate on some of these points to eliminate the worst case scenario of the libralis gravity compensation on Novint Falcon device . 3 . 4 . Preliminary Experiments on Libralis Software In this section , we are going to integrate the proposed interpolation method with libralis SDK . In section 3 . 4 . 1 , we investigate the influence of the vertices number to the performance of the gravity compensation . Section 3 . 4 . 2 integrates the point - cloud - based interpolation algorithm with libralis to enhance the boundary performance of gravity compensation . 3 . 4 . 1 . Performance Evaluation of Gravity Compensation using Libralis We conducted performance evaluations in this section to see how the density of vertices influences the precision of gravity compensation with libralis . We apply a force field on the end effector , which is rendered as a virtual fixture plane providing constraint force in Y direction ( figure 3 . 11 ) . The force is computed using an elastic model with stiffness k = 0 . 2N / mm . When the system achieves its stable state , the virtual penetration value ∆Y into the virtual fixture plane will be recorded . Ideally , ∆Y should be 0 if the gravity compensation equals to apparent gravity force . Here we use ∆Y to evaluate the performance of gravity compensation . 39 Figure 3 . 11 : A user - defined virtual fixture plane that provides constraint force in Y direction . Two sets of grid were created in our experiment : group 1 with 27 vertices ( figure 3 . 12a ) and group 2 with 125 vertices ( figure 3 . 12b ) . Note that we increased only the density of vertices , not the grid size , in group 2 . Both tests were run with same grid size , which is 40𝑚𝑚 ∗ 40𝑚𝑚 ∗ 40𝑚𝑚 . Grid with fewer vertices ( such as grid with 8 vertices ) is not chosen here for the consideration of the high non - linearity of the gravity force within a parallel mechanism . ( a ) ( b ) Figure 3 . 12 : Grids used in experiment ( a ) group one using grid with 27 vertices ; ( b ) group two using grid with 125 vertices . 40 The rest of parameters were set as follows : α = 40 , β = 800 , λ = 0 . 5 , 𝑛 𝑣 = 30 , 𝜀 𝑣 = 1 𝑚𝑚 𝑠 , 𝑛 𝐺 = 20 , 𝜀 𝐺 = 0 . 05 . We set a virtual fixture plane at Y = 0 . At each experiment , we evaluate 10 random points inside the grid and 10 random points outside the grid . The experiment results are shown in tables 3 . 2b . Table 3 . 2a : Offline auto - calibration time in experiments Group _ 1 Group _ 2 Offline estimation time ( s ) 312 1720 Table 3 . 2b : Errors of gravity approximation over test points inside the grid Gravity error ( N ) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Group _ 1 - 0 . 152 - 0 . 17 0 . 038 - 0 . 092 - 0 . 184 - 0 . 312 - 0 . 264 - 0 . 116 - 0 . 034 0 . 138 Group _ 2 - 0 . 252 - 0 . 054 - 0 . 21 - 0 . 094 - 0 . 194 - 0 . 268 - 0 . 18 - 0 . 222 0 . 196 - 0 . 124 Figure 3 . 13 : Mean absolute error of gravity approximation over 10 sample points inside the grid . Group 1 has 27 vertices and group 2 has 125 vertices . 41 Comparing the results of groups 1 and 2 and plotting the average mean errors of gravity compensation in figure 3 . 13 , we can see that there is no obvious enhancement in accuracy of gravity compensation if we increase the vertices number from 27 to 125 . The density of the vertices has little influence on the performance of gravity compensation . However , from table 3 . 2a , the offline estimation time used in group 2 is five times longer than the one used in group one . In order to save on offline estimation time , we opt to use 27 vertices in our experiment set . 3 . 4 . 2 . Integration of Point Cloud Method with libralis Test results of section 3 . 4 . 1 shows that the gravity compensation has few errors when the points are inside the grid . However , when the end effector moves out of the grid , the performance of gravity compensation deteriorates quickly . This is due to the mapping scheme applied in libralis when the points are outside the grid . In order to find an efficient way to enhance the performance of these points , a new scheme is proposed to integrate the libralis with the point cloud interpolation . In this method , different algorithms are applied according to the current position of the end - effector . For example , we still use 27 vertices created by libralis to interpolate the gravity compensation when the end effector is inside the grid . More evaluations must be conducted on the points outside the grid before we decide which of these points need to be interpolated with the new method . The grid we used in gravity compensation is a 40mm × 40mm × 40mm cube , centered at the origin point of haptic workspace . The vertex with the maximum coordinates value is ( 20 , 20 , 20 ) and the vertex with the minimum value is ( - 20 , - 20 , - 20 ) . The points outside the grid can be further separated into three categories : ( 1 ) type 1 has one coordinate exceeding the grid boundary ( e . g . , [ 10 , 30 , 10 ] ) ; ( 2 ) type 2 has two coordinates outside of the grid ( e . g . , [ 30 , - 30 , 10 ] ) ; type 3 has all three coordinates outside of the grid ( e . g . , [ 30 , 25 , 30 ] ) . We set the virtual fixture plane at Y = 30 with stiffness of k = 0 . 2N / mm and take 10 random points from each group to evaluate the performance of libralis on three types of points . The control parameters used here are α = 40 , β = 800 , λ = 0 . 5 , 𝑛 𝑣 = 30 , 𝜀 𝑣 = 1 𝑚𝑚 𝑠 , 𝑛 𝐺 = 20 , 𝜀 𝐺 = 0 . 05𝑁 . 42 ( a ) Type 1 point ( b ) Type 2 point ( c ) Type 3 point Figure 3 . 14 : Illustration of three types of points outside the grid The results are plotted in one graph ( see figure 3 . 15 ) . Type 1 and type 2 points still have a satisfactory performance and their mean absolute errors of gravity approximation are under 0 . 25N . If the gravity compensation error is larger than the static friction of the mechanism , the end - effector will fail to stay static without support from external force ; we term this condition as free - play in this thesis and this is the worst case scenario which should be eliminated in the application . No free - play was observed when we released the virtual fixture plane on type 1 or type 2 points . The result shows that the gravity error over type 3 points is much higher than the ones of the type 1 and type 2 groups . We also observed free - play effect in the experiment of the type 3 points when we released the virtual fixture plane . Table 3 . 3 Errors of gravity compensation over three types of test points ( unit / N ) Sample 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Type _ 1 - 0 . 22 0 . 124 - 0 . 174 - 0 . 232 - 0 . 098 - 0 . 142 - 0 . 148 - 0 . 05 - 0 . 3 0 . 22 Type _ 2 - 0 . 074 - 0 . 096 0 . 1 - 0 . 34 - 0 . 216 - 0 . 298 0 . 2 - 0 . 538 - 0 . 3 0 . 072 Type _ 3 - 0 . 232 - 0 . 46 - 0 . 44 - 0 . 426 0 . 584 - 0 . 98 0 . 258 - 0 . 456 - 0 . 282 - 0 . 62 43 Figure 3 . 15 : Mean absolute error of gravity approximation and related standard deviation , over three types of points outside the grid If we recall the mapping scheme of libralis when the end - effector lies outside of the grid , the cause of the large mean absolute errors in type - 3 points can be identified : libralis maps the point to its closest cubic side ( see discussion in section 3 . 2 . 4 ) , so the type 1 point is actually interpolated in the face of the cubic grid and has four control vertices ; the type 2 point is interpolated on the edge of the grid and has two control vertices ; the type 3 point is always mapped to the closest vertex at the corner of the grid , which means no interpolation is actually conducted on type 3 points , and their value is identical to the weight on the nearest vertex . According to the experiment result and analysis above , type 3 points can be classified as the worst - case scenario , and they need to be re - interpolated with the new algorithm . In our experiment , we define four vertices to interpolate the apparent gravity when the end - effector moves to coordinate ( x > 20 , y > 20 , z > 20 ) : one vertex at the corner X1 ( 20 , 20 , 20 ) ; three random points located on plane Y = 32 : X2 ( 29 . 44 , 32 , 23 . 45 ) , X3 ( 27 . 08 , 32 , 23 . 99 ) , X4 ( 33 . 03 , 32 , 21 . 66 ) . The gravity approximation errors are measured by applying virtual fixture planes with a stiffness of k = 1 . 2N / mm . The result is shown in table 3 . 5 . Noted that X1 is the vertex created by libralis , the apparent gravity at this point is measured directly in the offline auto - calibration phase ; thus we assume the gravity compensation error at this point is 0 . 44 Table 3 . 4 Gravity error at each point measured by the virtual fixture ( unit / N ) Δ𝐺 1 Δ𝐺 2 Δ𝐺 3 Δ𝐺 4 Error 0 - 0 . 516 - 0 . 528 - 0 . 276 We use gravity approximation error △ G as the weight value at each vertex , in accordance with the interpolation algorithm in section 3 . 3 . 4 : [ 𝐴𝐵𝐶𝐷 ] = [ 𝑋 0 𝑌 0 𝑋 1 𝑌 1 𝑍 0 1 𝑍 1 1 𝑋 2 𝑌 2 𝑋 3 𝑌 3 𝑍 2 1 𝑍 3 1 ] −𝟏 [ Δ𝐺 1 Δ𝐺 2 Δ𝐺 3 Δ𝐺 4 ] = [ 𝐴𝐵𝐶𝐷 ] = [ 20 20 29 . 44 32 20 1 23 . 45 1 27 . 08 32 33 . 03 32 23 . 99 1 21 . 66 1 ] −𝟏 [ 0 −0 . 516 −0 . 528 −0 . 276 ] = [ −0 . 047 0 . 060 −0 . 229 4 . 324 ] This yields the equation of gravity approximation error at the point P ( x > 20 , y > 20 , z > 20 ) : △ G = −0 . 047x + 0 . 06y − 0 . 229z + 4 . 324 We define G 0 as the new gravity compensation value and G L as the approximation value given by libralis . Then the new gravity compensation value can be calculated as follows : G 0 = G L −△ G After the new interpolation method was applied to the type 3 points , we re - evaluated the performance of gravity compensation at the coordinates ( x > 20 , y > 20 , z > 20 ) . Following the same experiment setup , we record the gravity approximation errors at 10 random points ( table 3 . 5 ) . From figure 3 . 16 , we observed significant decreasing in standard deviation and the mean absolute error after we updated the new compensation value G 0 . Also during the experiment , no more free - play of the end - effector was observed when we released the virtual fixture .

Test group 1 uses the original libralis method ; test group 2 uses the hybrid method which integrates the new interpolation algorithm with libralis . 3 . 5 . Summery In this chapter , the gravity compensation software ( libralis ) was investigated with regard to its performance on the Novint Falcon platform . As we can see from the results in table 3 . 3 , the points inside the grid have better performance than the ones outside the grid . Furthermore , performance deteriorates quickly if a point falls into the type _ 3 category . In order to enhance precision at the boundary and prevent free - play of the end effector , we proposed a new algorithm called point cloud interpolation . In section 3 . 3 , an automatic vertex creation scheme was presented . With this method , users can automatically create point cloud that contains the whole workspace . Users can also create points manually , and this procedure is adopted in the experiments in section 3 . 4 . 2 . The point cloud method has higher precision than libralis but is not as efficient . Section 3 . 4 . 2 can be considered a simple application of integrating the point cloud method to libralis . We manually create the points at the selected area and preprocess the parameters used in interpolation . The code maintains its efficiency while the performance of type 3 points increases . 46 4 . Haptic Aided Design This chapter investigates the feasibility of the proposed haptic aided design ( HAD ) process . In section 4 . 1 , we describe the motivation of chapter 4 . In section 4 . 2 , we give an overview of the HAD interface , including the layout and advantages of the HAD system . In section 4 . 3 and section 4 . 4 , two preliminary HAD interfaces are developed to validate the proposed HAD process . Section 4 . 5 is the summary of the entire chapter . 4 . 1 . Problem Descriptions Before the emergence of computer aided design ( CAD ) software , the design procedure was painful and costly . In the past , designers had to manually draw the drafts , and usually the quality was questionable due to the nature of manually drawing on paper . Sometimes a single mistake could ruin several months’ worth of paperwork . Moreover , the prototype’s cost in manual design could be extremely high and was considered a major burden to medium or small corporations . The success in the application of CAD software has greatly aided in development of virtual reality aided design . Engineers nowadays can easily create , modify and optimize their 3D model in a virtual environment ( VE ) . Those convenient features can greatly influence the precision of final drafts and the productivity of the entire design process . With proper add - ons , sometimes we can even use CAD software to simulate the contact force between various virtual objects . For example , NX system from Siemens [ 26 ] offers a solution of multi - body dynamics and kinematics analysis of rigid body mechanism ; as yet such applications are limited to simple cases where the models of different objects can be explicitly defined . Over the last few decades , the term “human factors ( ergonomics ) ” has become an important aspect of product engineering . Human factors investigate the interaction among users and other elements of the system for the purpose of improving user 47 experience and overall performance of the product [ 56 ] . However , such interaction can hardly be defined in virtual environment with current CAD software . In traditional product design procedure , a user experience evaluation is required as a complementary process for analyzing the human factor ; during this stage , various physical prototypes are needed to evaluate the user interaction . However , it could be both expensive and time - consuming to build these physical prototypes . Especially when testing on complex products that have multiple parts , the time spent on assembly and disassembly of the prototype could be a big issue . Moreover , these physical prototypes are not available until the product is ready for manufacturing . Consequently , the lag of user experience evaluation could affect the productivity of modern industrial design . Due to the challenges stated above , we adopt a new design process which integrates the haptic force feedback device with CAD system . In the thesis , we term this design process as “Haptic Aided Design ( HAD ) ” . With the aid of haptic device , users can interact with virtual prototype and modify the design parameters intuitively . More discussion of the advantage of the HAD system can be found in section 4 . 2 . In section 4 . 3 and section 4 . 4 we give two application of HAD to verify the feasibility of integrating haptic device with CAD interface . 4 . 2 . Overview of the HAD Procedure The HAD procedure can be considered as the integration of the haptic unit with the CAD environment . As a possible trend of VR system , this new technology brings many alternatives to CAD / CAM system design . For example , with the latest haptic rendering devices and collision detection algorithm , users can explore 3D environment and manipulate virtual objects directly , which is much more convenient than using traditional 2D input method . Figure 4 . 1 shows difference between the HAD and the traditional CAD procedure . We noted that HAD offers an interactive interface which allows users to manipulate the virtual prototypes through a haptic feedback device . This feature could possibly reduce the work during the real prototype evaluation ; and it allows designers to access the user experience evaluation at early design stage . Questions may arise with regard to the 48 feasibility and usability of virtual prototype in user experience evaluation . Indeed , the virtual prototype shows less product details than the real one . But with higher - precision haptic device and better simulation software , we can gradually reduce the proportion of physical prototypes used in future user experience evaluation . ( a ) ( b ) Figure 4 . 1 : Schemes represent two kinds of design process . ( a ) Traditional CAD process of industrial design , ( b ) Design process integrated with the HAD environment . The main advantages of the HAD interface are summarized as follows : ( 1 ) HAD can simplify the design work by implementing the design process in an intuitive way . It is welcomed by users who have no related background in modeling . Furthermore , this human - in - the - loop feature has prospective application in consumer - oriented design , where consumers can custom their own product with the aid of interactive VR system ; meanwhile , their perceptions of the product will be delivered to designers directly . Figure 4 . 2 shows a conceptual diagram of application in consumer - oriented design . If this is applicable , the HAD technology will significantly change the pattern of digital - shopping in future , where consumers can not only choose their favored 49 color or size , but also get a sensation of product such as the texture or weight information . Figure 4 . 2 : The architecture of HAD interface in consumer - oriented design ( 2 ) We create virtual prototypes as a supplement to the physical prototypes in user experience evaluation . Compared with the physical prototypes , testing with virtual prototypes is more efficient considering no assembly and disassembly are involved . As we already mentioned earlier in this section , this alternative prototyping method could save the time and cost of making real prototypes . ( 3 ) Designers can access the virtual prototypes in early design stage where real prototypes are not yet available . This feature could aid in establishing an effective iterative design process . Iterative design is a design methodology based on a cyclic process of prototyping , testing , analyzing , and refining a product [ 57 ] . Designers can recognize the flaws early and implement the change in an efficient and low - cost way . ( 4 ) Similar to CAD technologies , the HAD interface allows rapid communication of product information : the virtual prototype can be stored in digital form , which allows users to edit with ease ; these prototypes can be sent elsewhere quickly , which helps to speed communication between various industrial departments . 50 In the following sections , we will propose two applications which integrate the haptic device with the CAD environment , and some of these advantages will be validated in these case studies . 4 . 3 . Case Study One : Design of Injection - Aided Mechanism 4 . 3 . 1 . Motivation Needle insertion is one of the most common procedures in medical treatment . It is found in various medical processes for different purposes . For example , in a bone marrow exam , surgeons use a long needle to puncture the bone and extract bone marrow samples for a biopsy test . And in an amniocentesis procedure , physicians need to penetrate through the abdominal wall , uterus wall and amnion sac to obtain amniotic fluid . Some of these procedures are very dangerous and require that trainees undergo much practice before operating on a real human body . To provide a more flexible and economical training system , researchers have developed various virtual platforms for all of these training procedures [ 23 ] 24 ] [ 25 ] . Such platforms are rendered with one or multiple nonlinear boundaries representing the soft tissues , using either finite element method ( FEM ) or mesh - spring models . The elastic force , friction force and cutting force during the insertion can all be tuned using specific parameters , and the precision of the training system can be improved as data is collected from physical models . Inspired by these virtual training platforms , we decide to build a multi - modal interface with which users can design the mechanism used for facilitating the needle insertion procedure and test it in a virtual training environment . This interface consists of two parts : 1 ) A virtual needle insertion platform which can render reaction force of various layer of tissues . In the thesis , the realism of tissue is not the major concern and we use one - dimensional force model to render the resistance force when penetrating layer of skin tissue . This platform can be used to evaluate the performance of subcutaneous injection . Subcutaneous injection is required to insert the needle tip into the skin but above the muscle layer for slower absorption of medicine such as insulin and morphine . 51 The performance of such injection procedure is judged by the overshoot into the skin surface . 2 ) A mechanical design interface . In the thesis , a slider - crank mechanism is proposed to help the operator exercise better control during the needle insertion process . Through a dialogue box , users can change the configuration of the mechanism with ease . They can also manipulate the mechanism via the end effector of Novint Falcon to feel the resistance force from the needle tip . An informal user study was conducted to identify the best design via an intuitive method . We group the mechanism parameters and invite participants to test different parameter sets . During each trial , users are asked to stop as soon as they feel that the penetration completes , and the overshoot distance of the deformable surface is measured as criteria to judge the performance of the current mechanism configuration . 4 . 3 . 2 . Overview of HAD Interface Figure 4 . 3 shows the interface of our HAD platform . The needle insertion procedure is facilitated by using a slider - crank mechanism . A syringe is attached to the slider , and link 1 is attached to link 2 . The end - effector of Novint Falcon is represented by a small sphere in the virtual environment . On the left side of the figure 4 . 3 , we can see a virtual wall that represents the skin surface . 52 Figure . 4 . 3 : User interface of HAD platform in case study one When the small sphere gets close enough to the tip of link 1 ( see figure 4 . 4 ) , constraint force is applied which limits the movement of end - effector in a trajectory defined by the tip of link 1 . After that , the handle will follow the movement of the end - effector and users can manipulate the mechanism in the virtual environment . If the tip of the needle start to penetrate the skin layer represented by the virtual wall on the left ( figure 4 . 5 ) , users can feel the reaction force of tissue which is mapped from needle tip to the handle . For simplicity , we use one - dimensional force model to simulate the resistance force when we penetrate the skin . Considering that the needle strictly follows a linear path , this model is sufficient to simulate the axial - only force received by the needle tip . 53 Figure 4 . 4 : The sphere representing the end - effector of Falcon is attached to the handle . Figure 4 . 5 : The tip of needle is penetrating the skin layer . Figure 4 . 6 shows a schematic of slider - crank mechanism used in the HAD interface . Designers can adjust important linkage parameters to obtain a desired force profile that yields the best user performance . In our HAD environment , user performance is measured by the amount of overshoot into the skin surface ( figure 4 . 7 ) . L1 is the length of link 1 ; L2 is the length of link 2 ; L3 is the length of link 3 ; and θ is the angle between links 1 and 2 . D0 and D1 represent the damper coefficients of the virtual wall . D0 is the damper coefficient before the penetration , and D1 is the value after the 54 penetration . The combination of these two values can produce different reaction force on the virtual skin layer . The parameters ( L1 , L2 , L3 , D0 , D1 ) can be defined through the user interface shown on the right side of the main interface in figure 4 . 3 . Figure 4 . 6 : schematic of slider - crank mechanism 4 . 3 . 3 . Soft Tissue Modeling In this project , we use the one - dimensional needle insertion data collected by Leslie [ 28 ] . The skin puncture procedure is separated into three phases : ( 1 ) For p F x F  ) ( , Skin pre - puncture : 3 2 ) ( 0025 . 0 ) ( 0046 . 0 ) ( 0116 . 0 0235 . 0 ) ( s s s X X X X X X x F        ( 2 ) Skin puncture force : N F p 0372 . 6  ( 3 ) Skin post - puncture force : 2 ) ( 5287 . 0 ) ( 4516 . 0 0372 . 6 ) ( p p X X X X x F      55 X is the current needle position , s X is the skin surface position , and p X is the puncture position . This procedure of needle insertion is illustrated in figure 4 . 7 . Figure 4 . 7 : Three stages of needle insertion process : contact , deform and puncture Figure 4 . 8 : Partial plot of resistance force according to Leslie’s test result [ 28 ] , from skin layer to muscles layer . From figure 4 . 8 , we note that the reaction force at the needle tip increases during penetration . During the deformable stage , the force model can be described as a spring - damper model . The reaction force 𝐹 𝑆 at this stage can be represented as follows : 𝐹 𝑆 = 𝐾 𝑆 ∙ ∆𝑋 − D 0 ⋅ 𝑉 𝑥 , 56 where 𝐾 𝑆 is the spring constant at skin layer and ∆𝑋 is the penetration depth into the skin tissue ; D 0 is the damper coefficient before the penetration and 𝑉 𝑥 is the velocity vector in direction of penetration . In the thesis , we set D 0 = 0 . This model can be described as : 𝐹 𝑆 = 𝐾 𝑆 ∙ ∆𝑋 Ks in above equation can be determined by the puncture force 𝐹 𝑝 and the puncture limit 𝐹 𝑝 : 𝐾 𝑠 = 𝐹 𝑝 𝑋 𝑝 = 0 . 431 𝑁 / 𝑚𝑚 When the force exceeds the puncture limit X p , there is a major drop in resistance force . Then the spring force is replaced by a viscosity component , which is dependent on tissue constant and penetration speed . Then the force model is represented as follows : 𝐹 𝑠 = −𝐷 1 ⋅ 𝑉 𝑥 , where 𝐷 1 is the damping coefficient after the penetration and V is the velocity of the needle tip . The damper coefficient 𝐷 1 is dependent on the needle gauge and tip - type [ 28 ] . Giving an accurate 𝐷 1 is beyond the scope of the thesis . In this case study , we intuitively tuned the 𝐷 1 value to guarantee that users do not feel obvious force transient after we removed the spring force . The resistance force is then mapped to the handle on the link one , where users can feel the resistance force by manipulating the end - effector of Novint Falcon . 4 . 3 . 4 . Mechanical Design and Simulation In the thesis , the mechanism used to aid in the needle insertion procedure should provide a linear path at some point where the needle can be attached . Although we can generate a linear path with some other 4 - bar mechanism , the end effector also rotates when it moves in an approximately linear path . For example , in Hoecken’s mechanism 57 ( figure 4 . 9 ) , if the needle is attached to the red bar , it will follow a linear path , but it also rotates—which is not the motion desired in this application . If we let the needle rotate freely on its path , the guidance force is needed to adjust its angle , which will increase the complexity of the mechanical design . Figure 4 . 9 : Hoecken’s mechanism The slider - crank mechanism , which transforms rotary motion into linear motion ( figure 4 . 10 ) , can easily achieve this goal . This straightforward mechanism guarantees that the needle tip will always move in a linear path , which is ideal for this HAD evaluation platform . 58 Figure 4 . 10 : Schematic of slider - crank mechanism By changing the parameters set ( L1 , L2 , L3 ) , we obtain various ratios of force at the needle to the force mapped to tip of link 1 . The force exerted on the end effector will be separated into two parts : ( 1 ) the reaction force mapped from the side of needle during penetration ; ( 2 ) the restriction force from the virtual fixture , which gives users a feeling that end - effector is restricted by a revolute joint ; more details about this constraint force are discussed in the following section . Note that the two forces are always perpendicular to each other . From figure 4 . 10 , we can calculate the force mapped from the needle tip . Fb is the reaction force from the base ; F4 is the resistance force on the needle tip during the penetration ; F1 is the force mapped to the handle of link 1 and the direction of F1 is on the tangent of a circular path . The scalar of F1 can be calculated as follows : 1 / ) 4 * 4 4 * ( 1 L H F X Fb F   In above equation , L1 is the length of link 1 , and H4 is the pre - set height from the slider to the upper base . X4 is the distance from the node on the slider to the Y axis , and this value will be calculated according to the current status of the mechanical structure . 59 4 . 3 . 5 . Virtual Fixture The virtual fixture is a programmable force field used to guide or prevent the user’s movement . In this case study , the movement at the end effector is restricted by link 1 , which has one - dimensional rotary movement . The constraint force preventing deviation from the circular path will be applied when the end - effector is attached to the tip of link 1 . We assume point P represents the end effector and point O is the nearest point on the circular path , then we obtain a vector PO⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗ , which represents the current direction of the constraint force . This constraint force is computed as follows : F 𝑐 = 𝑘 𝑐 ⋅ PO⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗ − 𝐷𝑐 ⋅ 𝑣 where F 𝑐 is the constraint force and 𝑘 𝑐 is the spring constant . We add a damper with coefficient Dc in the above equation to absorb system energy , thus yielding a more stable constraint force . Note that v is the velocity vector indicating the change of distance from P to the current nearest point O on the path ; v has the same direction as PO⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗ . Figure 4 . 11 : Virtual fixture at the tip of linkage 1 4 . 3 . 6 . Experiment Design and User Study The program is compiled using VS 2005 . Graphic models are built in OpenGL using the GLUT library , the interface is built using the GLUI library and the haptic frame is built using HDAL API , provided by the Novint Company . P O O P 60 Four participants ( two males and two females ) from Simon Fraser University are invited to this user study . All participants are right - handed . None of them has past experience with the haptic device . Before the trial , the subjects are allowed to familiarize themselves with the Novint Falcon device through several demo applications . Then they are asked to maneuver the end effector of the Novint Falcon device to conduct the needle insertion process ( see figure 4 . 12 ) . For each trial , participants are required to perform three experiments in a row , and their overshoot d is recorded for further analysis . Figure 4 . 12 : Hand gesture when we are manipulating the Falcon device in the experiment ( grasp ) ; then end - effector ( grid ball ) represents the tip of the link 1 . To find the optimum parameters set of the mechanism structure , we use overshoot d ( see figure 4 . 7 ) as the control parameter to evaluate the overall performance of the needle insertion facilitation device . The stop position is recorded when the velocity of the needle tip drops to the pre - set threshold . We grouped some parameter sets in table 4 . 1 to research which group has the best performance in assisting with needle insertion procedure . The parameter θ is angle of handle bar to the link2 . It can influence the gesture of the needle insertion . In this user study , four kinds of mechanism ( see figure 4 . 13 ) with different handle angles are tested for the comfortableness and overall performance . The general principle of grouping these 61 parameters is to increase the ratio of motion ( v1 / v4 ) gradually from top to bottom in the form . Table 4 . 1 Group of parameters Parameters L1 , L2 , L3 ( mm ) Angle θ ( degree ) Values 150 , 80 , 200 15 , 30 , 60 , 75 150 , 80 , 180 150 , 100 , 180 180 , 100 , 180 Figure 4 . 13 : Four different handle bar configurations , from left to right , the handle bar angles are 15 ° , 30 ° , 60 ° and 75 ° respectively . The test result is shown in table 4 . 2 . Each value is averaged over 10 repetitions . Note that the puncture distance Xp in this force model is approximately 13 mm ; any value less than Xp is considered as system error and should be excluded from data groups . The best combinations are marked with bold font in table 4 . 2 , and the worst combination is labeled with “star” where the parameters are set with ( 150 , 100 , 180 , 15˚ ) . Upon closer examination of the data distribution , under the 60˚ column , users can achieve better performance with any linkage parameters . 62 Table 4 . 2 : Overshoot value during needle insertion of 16 samples ( mm ) Linkage parameters 15 ° 30 ° 60 ° 75 ° 150 , 80 , 200 28 20 22 24 150 , 80 , 180 30 18 17 15 150 , 100 , 180 35 ∗ 30 15 20 180 , 100 , 180 32 25 16 18 4 . 3 . 7 . Discussion In the first case study , we propose a HAD interface used to design the mechanism for facilitating the needle insertion process . Users can change the parameters ( 𝐶 0 , 𝐶 1 , 𝐾 ) to obtain the desired tissue property . On the other hand , the slider - crank mechanism can be configured with different handle - bar angles and linkage parameters . In our user studies , we group up these parameters to find the best combination . The performance of the needle insertion is judged by the maximum penetration distance d under the tissue layer . Result shows that with parameter θ = 60 ° , users can better maneuver the mechanism and have better performance of needle insertion process than with other angle configuration . From the experiment , we can see that HAD interface can help users to distinguish good and bad designs related to human factors . 63 4 . 4 . Case Study Two : Simulation of Virtual Refrigerator Door In the second case study , we simulate the opening and closing of a refrigerator door with the Novint Falcon device . This section primarily studies and demonstrates the feasibility of the HAD environment in aiding with force modeling during the early stage of design . A methodology named human - in - the - loop simulation is adopted to develop and evaluate the force modeling . 4 . 4 . 1 . Motivation In the first case study , we build a virtual skin tissue model based on the MTS puncture data collected by Leslie [ 28 ] . We recall that the friction force used in the post - puncture stage is based on an estimated coefficient value ( section 4 . 3 . 3 ) , which is not derived from any experimental result . Developing a conclusive friction force model with traditional discrete modeling process is usually challenging : it either needs a finite - element method or specific experiments to extract friction component [ 23 ] . The traditional force modeling process is exhibited in figure 4 . 14 . Figure 4 . 14 : traditional force modeling process 64 The above modeling process is not economical or efficient on low - fidelity simulator design . For example , in gaming industry , the haptic simulation focuses on perspective for entertainment instead of research purpose ; the short product lifecycle and high market demand call for a fast and effective solution for establishing simplified haptic models to represent various complex systems . A methodology named human - in - the - loop ( HITL ) simulation is adopted to facilitate the development of haptic simulation . HITL simulation , or termed as iterative simulation , always take human in the system design loop . The advantage of HITL is discussed extensively in literature [ 59 ] : ( 1 ) HITL is suitable for solving complex system with multiple dependencies , where designers can develop an iterative way to simplify the software abstraction . ( 2 ) Featured with active human interactions , HITL encourages users to identify the flaw of the design and offers them a level of access to the system variables . With active feedback from users , HITL methodology greatly aids in the system design when human factor is an important consideration . HITL is most commonly implemented in software engineering and product engineering . In the literature [ 60 ] , software engineers use Graph - Based Interface Language ( GRBIL ) tool to build a constructive simulation platform . This platform automatically records the activity of the users and compiles the behavior into operator models which can be used for human behavior prediction . In the work [ 61 ] , author proposed a novel decision - making process which helps users to plan the vehicle - route in time - critical situations . The process integrated with interactive - model shows higher flexibility than the automated solution . Inspired by the HITL systems stated above , we adopt a new haptic simulation process which uses iterative method to obtain desired force model . The process is illustrated in figure 4 . 15 . Compared with traditional simulation design loop , this new procedure requires no data collection and analysis ; it enables system cognition during the design loop which means designers get better understanding of the models involved after each user evaluation . 65 Figure 4 . 15 : Conceptual diagram of iterative simulation based on active human interaction In the following section , a haptic simulation platform is proposed to describe how HAD system facilitate the force modeling process and system cognition in the early stage of design . 4 . 4 . 2 . Overview of HAD Interface Figure 4 . 16 shows the main interface of our HAD platform . The white cubic object in the middle represents a virtual refrigerator viewed from the top . 66 Figure 4 . 16 : The configure dialogue of the HAD environment . A is the top view of a virtual refrigerator ; B marks the ratio buttons where users can choose different force models ; C marks the spinners where users can define five variables related to force model . The configure dialogue of the user interface lies on the left side of screen . The spinners at the bottom left ( figure 4 . 16c ) are used to configure the five variables used in the simulation . The variable D is the maximum displacement of the gasket in the opening phase with the seal still attached to the main body , and the unit for D is centimeters ; more details about this variable will be discussed in section 4 . 4 . 3 . M is the maximum magnetic force when the gasket is attached to the door and its unit is N . D 𝑚𝑖𝑛 is the distance from metal on the main body to magnetic strip when the fridge door is fully sealed , and its unit is centimeters ( see figure 4 . 17 ) . Ko and Kc represent the spring constant of elastic component of the reaction force during the opening and closing phases separately , the unit for Ko and Kc is N / cm . Three radio buttons ( figure 4 . 16b ) on the top left allow operators to select the force models applied in the user study . Details of the three models are discussed in section 4 . 4 . 3 . 67 Figure 4 . 17 Diagram of fridge gasket where Dmin is illustrated . In the experiment , Users hold the end - effector of Novint Falcon and move in the direction of z axis of haptic workspace . Users feel the force feedback which represents the reaction force during the opening and closing phases . Figure 4 . 18 : Gesture of user when manipulating the end - effector in the simulation . 4 . 4 . 3 . Haptic Model of Reaction Force during Opening and Closing a Refrigerator Door In this section , we will analyse the force model used in the simulation . After each force component analysis , we give a description to the user - defined variables related to the force model . 68 We noted that the opening force is usually stronger than the closing force of the refrigerator door . The cause of such effect has not been fully investigated . In the literature [ 27 ] , a research group from Pohang University of Science and Technology proposed a force model in their refrigerator door simulator . The model used in this 1 - Dof haptic simulation system is the combination of a magnetic force and an elastic force along with a state variable which is used to define the current state of the fridge door . The total force feedback can be represented as follows : When θ is small ( θ < 10 ∘ ) , the total reaction force exerted at the handle can be approximated to a force vector 𝐹 𝑡 in the z direction ( figure 4 . 19 ) . For simplicity of haptic rendering , we use 𝐹 𝑡 to model the reaction force in task space instead of joint space . Figure 4 . 19 : Top view of the reaction force exerted at the handle As we stated above , 𝐹 𝑡 is the function of z , which consists of elastic force , magnetic force and inertial force . The friction force caused by hinge is not considered in the proposed force model . We use the same state variable described in the literature [ 27 ] to define the force transition in haptic simulation , then 𝐹 𝑡 is represented as follows : 𝐹 𝑡 = ( 1 − 𝐶 ) 𝐹 𝑒 + 𝐶𝐹 𝑚 + 𝐹 𝑖 ( 4 . 4 . 1 ) where 𝐹 𝑡 is the total force , 𝐹 𝑚 is the magnetic force from the gasket , 𝐹 𝑖 represents the inertial force of the fridge door and 𝐹 𝑒 is the elastic force controlled by state variable C . If C = 0 , the door is closed and the force is represented by an elastic force . If C = 1 , the door is open and the magnetic force takes control . The transition is controlled by the 69 threshold M ( maximum magnetic force ) and θ ( angle of fridge door ) . When the resultant external force 𝐹 𝑒𝑥 exceeds M , variable C will be set to 1 ; when the rotation angle of the fridge door θ < 0 ( figure 4 . 19 ) , the variable C will be set to 0 . Inertial force In our force model , the inertial force is simplified to a one - dimensional force in z direction : F 𝑖 = 𝑚𝑧̈ where m is the mass constant , and 𝑧̈ is the projection of acceleration of the end - effector on the z axis . Magnetic Force The total magnetic force is computed by integrating the magnetic force with the metal over the four gasket segments . According to Maxwell equations , the pulling force of a single magnet to metal can be represented as follows : F = | 𝐵 ⊥ | 2 𝐴 2𝜇 0 ( 4 . 4 . 2 ) 𝐵 ⊥ is the normal component of a magnetic field applied to metal , and A is the area of surface . Figure 4 . 20 : The model for magnetic force computation 70 Supposing the magnetic force caused by the gasket is equivalent to the effect of a magnetic dipole centered at the gasket ( figure 4 . 20 ) . The z - component of magnetic field 𝐵 ⊥ can be estimated with the magnetic dipole equation [ 22 ] : | 𝐵 ⊥ | = 𝜇 0 | 𝑚 | 4𝜋 | 𝑟 𝑀 | 3 ( 2𝑐𝑜𝑠 2 𝜃 𝑚 + 𝑠𝑖𝑛 2 𝜃 𝑚 ) ( 4 . 4 . 3 ) By integrating the magnetic force over 𝜃 𝑚 , we obtain the total magnetic force at handle contact point H : 𝐹 𝑚 = 𝜇 0 ( 𝑀 | A 𝑀 | ) 2 A 32𝜋 2 ℎ 𝑐6 ∫ 𝑐𝑜𝑠 6 𝜃 𝑚 ( 𝜃 𝑐 −𝜃 𝑐 2𝑐𝑜𝑠 2 𝜃 𝑚 + 𝑠𝑖𝑛 2 𝜃 𝑚 ) 2 𝑑𝜃 𝑚 ( 4 . 4 . 4 ) where 𝜇 0 is the permeability of air . Parameter A 𝑀 is the area of the gasket surface , and ℎ 𝑐 is the distance from point P at the gasket to the metal . M is a dipole moment . 𝜃 𝑐 is 𝜃 𝑚 at the end of the gasket . Note that if the displacement is very small , the integration part of equation 4 . 4 . 11 can be approximated as a constant . For simplicity , the magnetic force can be regarded as function of the following : 𝐹 𝑚 = 𝐶 𝑚 ℎ 𝑐6 , ( 4 . 4 . 5 ) where 𝐶 𝑚 is a constant . If D 𝑚𝑖𝑛 is the minimum value of ℎ 𝑐 while the door is closed and M is maximum magnetic force , then we have following equations : M = 𝐶 𝑚 𝐷 𝑚𝑖𝑛6 , ℎ 𝑐 = 𝐷 𝑚𝑖𝑛 + ∆𝐷 𝑝 ( 4 . 4 . 6 ) 71 Figure 4 . 21 : Relationship of ∆𝐷 𝑝 and ∆H . ∆𝐷 𝑝 and ∆H are displacement of point P and H to their original locations when the door is close . ∆𝐷 𝑝 is the displacement of P in the z direction ( ∆𝐷 𝑝 = 0 when door is closed ) . We note that the magnetic dipole P is located at the center of the gasket , and then the displacement at point P is approximately half of the offset ∆H at the handle contact point H ( figure 4 . 21 ) : ∆𝐷 𝑝 = 1 2 ∆H ( 4 . 4 . 7 ) Substituting ( 4 . 4 . 6 ) and ( 4 . 4 . 7 ) into ( 4 . 4 . 5 ) , we obtain 𝐹 𝑚 as a function of ∆𝐻 : 𝐹 𝑚 = M ∗ 𝐷 𝑚𝑖𝑛6 ( 𝐷 𝑚𝑖𝑛 + 1 / 2 ( ∆𝐻 ) ) 6 In the simulation , we use M and 𝐷 𝑚𝑖𝑛 to obtain various magnetic force profile . Figure 4 . 22 shows the influence of parameters M and 𝐷 𝑚𝑖𝑛 on magnetic force . M determines the peak point of the force profile ; 𝐷 𝑚𝑖𝑛 affects how fast the magnetic force drops . 72 Figure 4 . 22 : Magnetic force when M = 10 . Plot shows the magnetic force profile when 𝐷 𝑚𝑖𝑛 = 0 . 5 , 𝐷 𝑚𝑖𝑛 = 0 . 8 , 𝐷 𝑚𝑖𝑛 = 1 . Elastic Force In the thesis , we assume the elastic force consists of two parts : The elastic force 𝐹 𝑒𝑔 caused by deformation of the gaskets ; the elastic force 𝐹 𝑒𝑎 cause by the atmospheric pressure offset when stretching a sealed container . ( 1 ) The elastic force caused by gaskets is relatively simple . We divide the gasket into four segments . Figure 4 . 23a shows the layout of the gaskets and their corresponding constants in figure 4 . 23b . 73 ( a ) ( b ) Figure 4 . 23 : ( a ) diagram of a refrigerator door and gasket , ( b ) spring force model of the gaskets When θ is small , the elastic force applied to the handle can be approximated as follows : 𝐹 𝑒𝑔 = 𝑘 𝑔 ∆𝐻 ( 4 . 4 . 8 ) where ∆𝐻 is the displacement at the handle in z axis , and 𝑘 𝑔 is the effective spring constant of four parallel springs defined in figure 4 . 23b . ( 2 ) In the thesis , we assume the elastic force 𝐹 𝑒𝑎 caused by pressure difference is essential in force modeling . Figure 4 . 24 exhibits the volume change during the opening phase , while the gasket is still sealed and no air leaks into the fridge , pulling on the door creates a pressure difference between the inside and outside while the seal stretches . 74 Figure 4 . 24 : Change of volume inside the fridge storage room . The left picture shows the static state when the fridge door is sealed . The right one illustrates the volume change during the opening phase while the magnetic strip still attached to the body . We assume the temperature inside the storage room stays same if the gaskets are sealed . According to ideal gas law , this sealed container fits the condition of isothermal process ( constant temperature ) . The relationship between volume and pressure inside a sealed tank can be expressed as follows : 𝑉 𝑚 ∙ 𝑃 = 𝑛𝑅𝑇 Where V m is the volume of the tank , P is pressure , R is the universal gas constant per mole , n is mole count and T is absolute temperature . In order to simplify the model , we assume that the temperature inside the fridge doesn’t change while the gasket is still well sealed . Then the opening force caused by volume change can be expressed as follows : 𝐹 𝑒𝑎 = 1 2 ∗ ∆𝑃 ∗ 𝑆 = ( 𝑛𝑅𝑇 2𝑉 𝑚 − 𝑛𝑅𝑇 2𝑉 0 ) ∗ 𝑆 ( 4 . 4 . 9 ) 75 S is the area of the fridge door . 𝑉 𝑚 is the volume of the fridge’s storage room while the door is fully closed . 𝑉 0 is the volume while the fridge door is opening and the gasket is still sealed . Assume that the storage room has length l , depth d and height h ( figure 4 . 25 ) ; the volume can be written as follows : 𝑉 𝑚 = 𝑙 ∗ 𝑑 ∗ ℎ ( 4 . 4 . 10 ) 𝑉 0 = 𝑙 ∗ ℎ ∗ ( 𝑑 + ∆𝐻 / 2 ) ( 4 . 4 . 11 ) Figure 4 . 25 : Dimension of a refrigerator ∆𝐻 is the distance between the outer edge of the fridge door and the body ( see figure 4 . 24 ) . Substituting ( 4 . 4 . 10 ) and ( 4 . 4 . 11 ) into equation 4 . 4 . 9 , we get 𝐹 𝑒𝑎 = ( 𝑛𝑅𝑇 2𝑙ℎ𝑑 − 𝑛𝑅𝑇 2𝑙ℎ ( 𝑑 + ∆𝐻 / 2 ) ) ∙ 𝑆 = 𝑊 ∙ ∆𝐻 2𝑑 + ∆𝐻 ( 4 . 4 . 12 ) where W = 𝑛𝑅𝑇𝑆 2𝑙𝑑ℎ and can be considered as a constant . When d ≫ ∆𝐻 , equation 4 . 4 . 12 can be simplified as follows : 𝐹 𝑒𝑎 = 𝑊 ∙ ∆𝐻 2𝑑 = 𝑘 𝑎 ∆𝐻 ( 4 . 4 . 13 ) 76 This indicates the force caused by atmospheric pressure is also an elastic component . We can merge 𝐹 𝑒𝑎 with 𝐹 𝑒𝑔 to obtain the total elastic force during the opening phase : 𝐹 𝑒 = 𝐹 𝑒𝑎 + 𝐹 𝑒𝑔 = ( 𝑘 𝑎 + 𝑘 𝑔 ) ∆𝐻 = 𝐾 𝑜 ∆𝐻 ( 4 . 4 . 14 ) where 𝐾 𝑜 is the effective spring constant of the elastic component during the opening phase . The storage room is no longer a sealed tank system during the closing phase . Therefore , the elastic force during the closing phase only involves one component : 𝐹 𝑒 = 𝐹 𝑒𝑔 = 𝐾 𝑐 ∆𝐻 ( 4 . 4 . 15 ) 𝐾 𝑐 is the spring constant of the elastic component during the closing phase . In our simulation , 𝐾 𝑜 and 𝐾 𝑐 can be configured to produce various elastic force . The influence of 𝐾 𝑜 to the simulated opening force profile is illustrated in figure 4 . 26 . With higher stiffness , users can get less sensation to the force transient during the opening phase . The influence of 𝐾 𝑐 to the simulated closing force profile is illustrated in figure 4 . 27 . Higher stiffness of elastic component offers users a smoother contact to the refrigerator body . 77 ( a ) ( b ) Figure 4 . 26 : the simulated force profile in the opening phase , in both cases , M = 6N ; 𝐷 𝑚𝑖𝑛 = 1𝑐𝑚 ( a ) opening force with Ko = 30N / cm ( b ) opening force with Ko = 10N / cm .

Revised Force Model Based on equation 4 . 4 . 1 , we propose two different force models for model revision . In user study section , we conducted various tests to evaluate the fidelity of the revised haptic models . 78 ( a ) We assume the inertial force in the haptic simulation is relatively small compared to other force components and it has little influence to the sensation of opening and closing force . In the first revised model , we remove the inertial force in equation 4 . 4 . 1 and obtained : 𝐹 𝑡 = ( 1 − 𝐶 ) 𝐹 𝑒 + 𝐶𝐹 𝑚 ( 4 . 4 . 16 ) ( b ) In the second revised model , we removed the elastic component caused by atmospheric pressure , which makes 𝐾 𝑜 = 𝐾 𝑐 = 𝑘 𝑔 , the total force is still in the form of equation ( 4 . 4 . 1 ) . In the control panel ( figure 4 . 16b ) , the radio buttons allow users to choose from three different force models : ForceModel _ 1 option is corresponding to the original model ; ForceModel _ 2 option is corresponding to the revised model ( a ) ; ForceModel _ 3 option is corresponding to the revised model ( b ) . The last variable D in the control panel describes the maximum displacement of the handle in the opening phase before the force transition occurs . In ideal circumstances , given the value of M and Ko , parameter D can be computed as follows : D = M 𝐾 𝑜 However , in above equation , we instinctively assume the gasket perform detachment uniformly during the opening phase . In reality , the part of gasket close to the handle always detaches first , which makes the force transition from elastic component to magnetic component happen sooner than in ideal circumstances ( see figure 4 . 28 ) . Note that D should always be set less than M 𝐾 𝑜 and it has no influence to the closing force . 79 ( a ) ( b ) Figure 4 . 28 : Influence of parameter D to the simulated force in the opening phase . In both cases , M = 8 , 𝐷 𝑚𝑖𝑛 = 1 , Ko = 10 ( a ) force profile under ideal circumstance ( b ) force profile with user - defined D , D = 0 . 5 4 . 4 . 4 . Experiment Design and User Study The user study is conducted through two experiments : the goal of the first one is to find out which force model has higher fidelity ; the goal of the second one is to adjust variables involved in the force model , and it also works as a complement to the whole HITL haptic simulation process . The participants in both experiments are students from Simon Fraser University : four females and four males between the ages of 20 and 35 . All participants are right - handed ; Three of them have experience in manipulating the haptic device . Only one has experience with the Novint Falcon device , which is used in these experiments . In all experiments , participants are asked to manipulate the end effector of the Novint Falcon haptic device , which represents the handle of a virtual refrigerator door . All participants are required to pull the virtual handle three times in a row and then less than 10 seconds later , they are asked to pull the real refrigerator door as a comparison basis . The sequence of test objects will be shuffled after each participant finishes the test . In experiment 1 , participants are asked to take the trials on three force models described in section 4 . 4 . 3 . Participants are also asked to compare the virtual fridge door 80 to a real one and score it based on realism of the simulator . The score of fidelity is scaled from 1 to 5 , with 5 representing the greatest fidelity and 1 representing the least fidelity of the haptic rendering . The score of fidelity is given separately for the opening and closing phases ( column c represents the closing stage , and column o represents the opening stage ) . The results of user evaluation are listed in table 4 . 3 .

Discussion As an informal user study , the results in the both experiments may not reflect the pattern because of the limited number of participants . More participants with different backgrounds are needed to evaluate the statistical significance of these experiments . In the thesis , for simplicity of the simulation loop , we assume that the scores given by the users can 100 % reflect their sensation to the force model . In experiment 1 , we compared three force models implemented with different force components . The first one contains both inertial force and atmospheric pressure component ; the second one excludes inertial force ; the third one excludes atmospheric pressure components . No significant differences ( figure 4 . 29 ) were observed among these models in scores of fidelity given by participants . The user feedback indicates that contribution of inertial and atmospheric pressure components to fidelity of the haptic simulation is negligible . 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 2 . 5 3 3 . 5 4 A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Open Close 83 In experiment 2 , we removed both inertial force and atmospheric pressure component in the force model , and we use four variables to render various force profile ( noted that Ko = Kc under this circumstance ) . The average score of system fidelity are shown in figure 4 . 30 . The category with user - defined D parameter ( D < M 𝐾 𝑜 ) shows higher fidelity than the one with default D value ( D = M 𝐾 𝑜 ) , which indicated parameter D is an important variable to render a realistic haptic sensation in this case study . From the description of variables in section 4 . 4 . 3 , D represents s the non - uniformity of gasket’s detachment . The results confirmed our assumption that during the opening phase , the gaskets detach non - uniformly . Groups with parameters set ( M = 25 , Dmin = 10 ) shows lowest fidelity . If we take a close look at the parameter value , the peak force in these groups already exceed the maximum output of Novint falcon device ; thus actuators will saturate and send undesired force to the end effector . The cause of low fidelity on these groups shows irrelevance to the force model itself . From this point of view , determining the effective initial parameters for iterative design requires comprehensive understanding of the multimodal system ( including the hardware and software ) . 4 . 5 . Summary In this chapter , we mainly investigate the feasibility of using haptic device to facilitate the design process . The multi - modal design interface developed in the first case study allows users to design and evaluate the model in an intuitive way . The second case study shows that haptic device can assist in the early stage of design . With active human interaction , designers can develop an effective iterative simulation process which helps them to determine the haptic model variables in discretized domain . 84 5 . Conclusions and Future Work 5 . 1 . Conclusions The main objective of the thesis is to investigate the feasibility of using force feedback device as an aid in design . The multi - modal design interface consists of three parts : a haptic feedback device , haptic rendering and basic visual rendering . In chapter 2 we gave an extensive overview of the haptic device ( Falcon ) used in the thesis , which helps us better understand the device configurations and limitation at fundamental level . In chapter 3 , we use approximation based gravity compensation method to cancel the apparent gravity force at the end - effector . In order to reduce the approximation error of libralis software , we proposed a conceptual interpolation scheme which consists of a grid creation procedure and a tetrahedron interpolation algorithm . In experiment , we successfully reduce the approximation error at the workspace boundary by integrating the new method with libralis . In chapter 4 , we propose two preliminary HAD interfaces to explore how a haptic device aid in the design process . In the first case study , we build a needle insertion interface which is used to simulate the axial force during the needle insertion process . Based on the haptic frame above we develop a user interface where human operators can manipulate the virtual slider - crank mechanism used for facilitating the needle insertion procedure . Users can configure the mechanism structures by modifying parameters in the control panel and find out their preferred design in an intuitive method . In the second case study , we simulate the opening and closing force of a refrigerator door . The feedback from user study helps designers to exclude the less important parameters to human factors in early design stage . This human - in - the - loop ( HITL ) methodology allows users to model haptic force feedback without collecting and analyzing the raw data from real prototype testing . It also enables system cognition during the iterative design loop . 85 5 . 2 . Future Work The experiment result of gravity compensation in chapter 2 shows high standard deviation which indicates low system transparency . The future work related to improving the transparency of Novint Falcon device has two directions : 1 ) establish a friction force model to compensate the friction force of the parallel mechanism ; 2 ) use embedded processor to control actuators in a real - time operating system to avoid any data loss . In our multi - modal design interface , only basic graphic rendering is provided . The force model used in the simulation is one - dimensional which greatly restricts its ability to handle more complicated situation . In future work , we expect to implement the multi - modal interface with a more sophisticated simulation platform . In our second case study , the variables used in the iterative simulation loop are grouped up and updated manually . Therefore , the efficiency of the iterative simulation is largely dependent on the logic and knowledge of the designers . The ultimate goal of iterative design is to “invite users in and take designers out” . Possible future work includes developing an inclusive manual of iterative design method or building an automated decision - making system with latest artificial Intelligence technology . 86 Bibliography [ 1 ] SensAble Technologies , Inc . , [ Online ] Available : http : / / www . sensable . com , [ Accessed : Nov . 23 , 2012 ] .

Figure B . 2 : Photo of DC motor and encoder 94 Appendix . B . 2 . Novint Falcon—Introduction and Basic Experiment Setup Novint Falcon is a 3 - DOF translational - only device from a company called Novint Technologies , Inc . This device was originally designed for the gaming industry and retails at CA $ 250 new or at CA $ 99 used . Compared to Omega - 3 from Force Dimension , which costs more than CA $ 20 , 000 , Novint Falcon has become an appealing alternative as a force - rendering device in simulation despite its reduction in stiffness and increased friction . The computer used in the experiments contains an AMD ( R ) dual core 2 . 0GHZ CPU and 3GB of RAM . The operating system installed on this computer is Microsoft Windows Vista . All experiments and data analyses are run under the Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 workstation . Programs are coded with Windows - only HDAL API , released by the Novint Company . HDAL API is a uniform interface supporting haptic control on all Novint company devices . However , users can choose libnifalcon [ 49 ] as an alternative API if they want to operate using the Linux system or want to have a better control over actuators . The interface uses an update rate of 1 kHz to maintain the force control . However , Hillier [ 47 ] observed a noticeable delay due to the low performance of the USB interface . Graphic rendering is accomplished using open graphics library ( OpenGL ) , which is a cross - language , cross - platform API used for drawing complex 2D or 3D graphic scenes with simple primitives . 95 Appendix C .
