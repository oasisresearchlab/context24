This research was aimed at exploring the relationship between socio - economic factors and e - scooter trip durations before and during the pandemic . We developed a hazard - based duration approach and estimated multiple spatial and non - spatial models on the basis of 2019 and 2020 dockless e - scooter data collected from the City of Austin’s Open Data Portal . The results indicated an overall increase in e - scooter trip durations after the pandemic . Moreover , analysis of variables revealed potential changes in users’ behavior before and during the pandemic . In particular , whereas e - scooter trip durations were found to be positively associated with aggregate travel time to work before the pandemic , this trend was reversed during the pandemic . In addition , during the pan - demic , e - scooter travel time was positively correlated with the ratio of individuals with bachelor’s degrees or greater to those with associate degrees or lower . However , no specific pattern was observed before the pandemic . Lastly , the results showed the presence of disparities within the study area ; therefore , it is vital to extend e - scooter service areas to cover underserved communities . Keywords spatial data , e - scooters , COVID - 19 , statistical analysis In 2020 , the global outbreak of the 2019 coronavirus dis - ease ( COVID - 19 ) that originated from Wuhan , China infected over 91 . 5 million people and resulted in a loss of 1 . 9 million lives around the world ( 1 ) . The virus rapidly spread beyond China and reached its peak in the Middle East and Europe , with especially high cases occurring in Iran and Italy . In late March 2020 , the pandemic also consolidated in the United States with a total of 82 , 000 confirmed cases ( 2 ) . Over the past year , the pandemic has affected all facets of human life , including econo - mies and transportation operations . For example , more than 25 million people lost their jobs from February to April 2020 ( 3 ) , and the U . S . suffered a $ 50 billion loss in its real gross domestic product ( 4 ) . COVID - 19 like - wise posed significant challenges to every aspect of transportation in the U . S . A case in point is the situation in the early phase of the pandemic , during which airlines and passenger railway services experi - enced an up to 50 % drop in bookings and operations . Urban public transportation has also been tremen - dously affected because of stay - at - home orders , travel anxiety , and fear of infection , which have driven a large proportion of the population to shift from public to private modes of work ( 5 ) . Similar to other transportation systems , shared mobi - lity services in the U . S . suffered a sharp reduction in usage in March 2020 , thus forcing many businesses to 1 Urban Information Lab , University of Texas at Austin , Austin , TX Corresponding Author : Amin Azimian , amin . azimian @ austin . utexas . edu suspend system operations . One of the newest forms of shared mobility services that have recently gained popu - larity in the country is shared and dockless e - scooter ser - vices ( e . g . , Lime and Bird scooters ) , which provide a convenient and sustainable mode of transportation and allow users to travel over short and inter - distance trips . E - scooters have successfully satisfied the huge gap between supply and demand in the market and have become highly favored transit modes because of their flexibility ( 6 ) . The evaluation of data released by Transportation TPBo ( 7 ) and Department CoAT ( 8 ) indicated that cities with e - scooter sharing systems , such as Austin and Portland , have seen usage rates rise by the end of sum - mer 2020 . Specifically , these cities registered a 64 % and 46 % increase in e - scooter use , respectively , including a doubling of travel in low - income neighborhoods . During a time characterized by a reluctance to opt for transit and carsharing services , people are using e - scooters for essential trips mostly because these vehicles serve as a clean and open - air mobility option that also enables users to maintain social distancing ( 9 ) . According to sur - vey data conducted by the City of Chicago , 22 % of riders have often used e - scooters to avoid public trans - port systems , given COVID - 19 concerns . The majority of e - scooter users likely belong to the 25 - to 34 - year age group , are almost twice as likely to have a bachelor’s degree , are 1 . 7 times more likely to identify as White than average , and 1 . 3 times more likely to identify as male ( 10 ) . Similar trends are expected from other U . S . cities with e - scooter sharing services . Although the built environment factors as well as socio - demographic characteristics of e - scooter users have been well examined in different studies ( 6 , 11 , 12 ) , the extent to which they have contributed to e - scooter trip durations before and during the pandemic is unclear . Such information would assist operators and decision makers to investigates potential demographic and eco - nomic disparities across census tracts during the pan - demic , and to broaden their offering and price attractively to appeal to a broader user base . The current research contributes to the literature in several ways . First , earlier research has mostly focused on e - scooter trip frequency rather than e - scooter ridership duration . Therefore , there is scant information on the extent to which socio - economic and built environment factors contribute to such duration . Second , we investigated possible changes in trip durations before and during the pandemic . Finally , we adopted a hazard - based duration model with unstructured spatial random effect terms to account for unmeasured risk factors across census tracts in Austin . Literature Review Travel Behaviors and COVID - 19 Over the last year , many studies have explored the impact of COVID - 19 on transportation on the basis of different changes , such as those occurring for modal shares ( 13 – 19 ) , transit ridership ( 14 , 20 , 21 ) , airline operation ( 22 , 23 ) , railway systems operation ( 24 ) , daily outdoor activi - ties ( 14 , 19 , 22 , 25 – 30 ) , telework status ( 22 , 31 ) , travel distances ( 18 , 32 ) , homestay dwell time , and attitudes and risk perceptions ( 33 ) . These explorations highlighted a large decline in mobility as a result of state - level lock - downs and the fear of COVID - 19 infection . Abdullah et al . ( 34 ) conducted a factor analysis and proposed a logit model to identify the effects of socio - economic factors on modal shares for primary outdoor trips across various countries . They reported that gender , car ownership , employment status , and travel distance have affected the travel mode choices of individuals dur - ing the pandemic . Jiao and Azimian ( 35 ) explored the relationship between socio - demographic factors and changes in the number of trips made via public transpor - tation systems before and during the pandemic . The authors found that age , gender , educational status , mari - tal status , work loss , difficulty with expenses , and house - hold size were significantly associated with changes in travel behavior . Bucsky ( 17 ) analyzed changes in modal shares in Budapest , Hungary in March 2020 and uncov - ered a significant decrease in transit ridership alongside the increased use of private vehicles and bicycles . de Haas et al . ( 26 ) evaluated alterations in work and travel behaviors in the Netherlands as a result of a national lockdown in the country . Their results , which were based on work and travel data on 2 , 500 respondents , indicated that work - and education - related travel activities have decreased by 68 % amid the global outbreak . The authors also reported that the elderly population has reduced participation in outdoor activities more drastically than other population groups . Employing GPS ( global posi - tioning system ) data on changes in average travel dis - tance , Engle et al . ( 32 ) used COVID - 19 cases and population characteristics to estimate the effects of dis - ease prevalence and restriction orders on individual mobility in the U . S . They revealed that traveled distances have been substantially reduced in response to changes in perceived disease prevalence and stay - at - home directives . E - Scooter Ridership and COVID - 19 Since the emergence of e - scooter ridership in the U . S . in 2017 , various studies have attempted to examine travel behavior patterns under shared e - scooter use ( 36 – 41 ) and 630 Transportation Research Record 2677 ( 4 ) their relationship with built environment and socio - demographic factors ( 6 , 11 , 12 , 37 ) . McKenzie ( 40 ) , for instance , compared the spatiotemporal patterns reflected in dockless e - scooters trips against those of station - based bike trips in Washington DC . He reported that bikeshar - ing customers are more likely to commute to and from work compared with e - scooter users . Similarly , Mathew et al . ( 39 ) performed spatiotemporal analyses of e - scooter trips in Indianapolis and found the downtown area and university campuses as two geographic hotspots for e - scooter traffic , with most scooter activities observed between 11 a . m . and 9 p . m . Additionally , the association between e - scooter ridership and built environments and has been investigated and it has been discovered that e - scooter ridership is positively correlated with land use mix , transit accessibility , open spaces , and educational centers ( 6 , 11 , 12 ) . To the best of our knowledge , few studies ( 38 , 41 ) have attempted to analyse e - scooter services during the pandemic . One of the rare pieces of research is that of Yan et al . ( 41 ) , who conducted a spatiotemporal analysis of the interaction between e - scooter services and two existing travel modes ( i . e . , public transit and bikesharing ) in Washington DC . The authors reported that e - scooters have complemented bikesharing and transit ridership in underserved neighborhoods . A similar investigation is that conducted by Li et al . ( 38 ) , who evaluated changes in micro - mobility travel behaviors before and during the pandemic in Switzerland . Their results revealed that users have traveled longer distances using micro - mobility services during the pandemic than before this crisis . Moreover , bike and e - bike services have induced more changes compared with e - scooter services during the COVID - 19 global outbreak . Despite the insights derived from these works , however , they are limited in that they failed to assess whether changes have occurred in the relationship between e - scooter trip durations and poten - tial contributing factors ( e . g . , socio - demographic and built environment factors ) before and during the pan - demic . Table 1 shows the summary of past works . Method Non - Spatial Model Survival analysis has been extensively used in biostatis - tics ( 42 ) and social sciences ( 43 ) , and it refers to analysis of time - to - event such as time to death or time to recover from a specific disease . However , in this study , we uti - lized the e - scooter trip duration as the variable of interest for the survival analysis . It should be noted that the sur - vival approach has major advantages over traditional regression models . The traditional regression model defines a probability distribution for travel time and fit it using data , whereas the survival model specifies the probability of the outcome as a sequence of conditional events ( 44 ) . That is , owing to COVID - 19 risk perceptions and availability of other transport systems , users may consistently re - evaluate the use or e - scooters for longer / shorter trips during the pandemic . Let T be a non - negative , random variable represent - ing e - scooter trip duration . f ( t ) be the probability density and F ( t ) be the cumulative distribution function giving the probability that the e - scooter travel time of individ - ual does not exceed t . F ð t Þ ¼ P ð T ł t Þ ¼ ð t 0 f ð u Þ : du ð 1 Þ Therefore , the survival function can be written as com - plement of the cumulative distribution function , which is given as follows : S ð t Þ ¼ P ð T . t Þ ¼ ð ‘ t f ð u Þ : du ð 2 Þ where S ( t ) is the survival probability , which gives the probability that the e - scooter trip duration of an individ - ual is greater than t . In survival analysis , the hazard rate function is used to characterize the distribution of T can , and it is defined as : h ð t ij Þ ¼ lim D t ! 0 P ð t ł T \ t + D t j T ø t Þ D t ¼ f ð t Þ 1 (cid:2) F ð t Þ ¼ (cid:2) d dt log ½ S ð t Þ(cid:3) ð 3 Þ where h ( t ) is the hazard rate , and it represents the instan - taneous probability that the e - scooter trip duration ends in the interval ( t , t + dt ) , given that the trip duration has not ended before t . By integrating the above expression from 0 to t , the survival function will be derived as follows : S ð t Þ ¼ exp (cid:2) ð t 0 h ð x Þ : dx (cid:2) (cid:3) ð 4 Þ As the e - scooter trip duration is influenced by built envi - ronment and socio - demographic factors , a proportional hazard must be employed to accommodate these effects . Exponential , Weibull , Lognormal , Gompertz , and so forth are some of the common distributions that can be used to specify the hazard rate . In this study , a Weibull model is parametrized as a proportional hazard . The Weibull distribution is a generalization of the exponen - tial distribution . It is popular in survival analysis as it can accurately model the time - to - event outcomes ( 45 ) . The Weibull model is suitable for modeling data with monotone ( increasing or decreasing ) hazard rates over time , and its hazard and survival functions can be writ - ten as follows : h ð t Þ ¼ h 0 ð t Þ : exp ð b X Þ ð 5 Þ Azimian and Jiao 631 T a b l e 1 .

It should be noted that , one unit change in the magnitude of a variable would change the hazard by [ exp ( b x ) 2 1 ] 3 100 % . Therefore , the positive sign of a variable is associated with increased hazard rate ( reduced travel time ) and vice versa . Spatial Model To account for spatial / zone - level unmeasured risk fac - tors ( and not spatial autocorrelation ) affecting trip dura - tion of subject i in census tract j . Equations 5 and 6 were re - written to include unstructured spatial random effect term ( u j ) , which is as follows : h ð t ij Þ ¼ h 0 ð t ij Þ : exp ð b X j + u j Þ ð 7 Þ S ð t ij Þ ¼ exp (cid:2) exp ð b X j + u j Þ : t ijp (cid:4) (cid:5) ð 8 Þ where u j is a census tract - level random effect term that captures the correlation among latent / unobserved factors ( e . g . , people’s risk perception toward COVID - 19 , atti - tudes / perceptions toward traveling , geographical charac - teristics ) , affecting e - scooter trip durations in the census tract . Data To demonstrate the proposed method , we empirically analyzed data on dockless e - scooter trip durations over the Austin metropolitan area , with the geographical units of analysis being census tracts . E - scooters appeared in Austin in 2018 with around 6 , 000 e - scooters , mostly located in central census tracts including downtown area . Currently , there are 11 , 600 devices from multiple shared mobility providers ( e . g . , Bird , Lime , etc . ) in Austin area with the rate of $ 0 . 35 / min to $ 0 . 39 / min . According to the City of Austin transportation department , 5 , 383 , 780 ( with average trip duration of 11 . 8 min ) and 1 , 588 , 741 e - scooter trips ( with average trip duration of 15 . 5 min ) were taken in 2019 and 2020 respectively . Data concerning the city’s boundaries and census tracts were collected from the Texas Department of Transportation and the Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing digital database , respectively . Dockless e - scooter data for 2019 and 2020 ( data points after March 11 , 2020 when the World Health Organization declared COVID - 19 a pandemic ) were obtained from the City of Austin’s Open Data Portal . The dataset contained information on individual trip duration , trip distance , trip date , beginning and end - ing times , and origin and destination census tracts . According to the Austin Transportation Department , official trip reporting metrics cover only travels that meet the following criteria : ( a ) a trip distance greater than or equal to 0 . 16 km ( 0 . 1 mi ) and less than 805 km ( 500 mi ) and ( b ) a trip duration of less than 24 h . Given the large size of the dataset and to efficiently examine the data , we extracted a portion of data through a stratified sampling method ( by census tract ) using STATA statistical soft - ware to achieve convergence as well as to ensure that each census tract ( if there were observations for this tract ) was adequately represented in the selected sample . From the U . S . Census Bureau , we collected informa - tion on census tract - level socio - economic factors , such as aggregate travel time to work , median annual household income , members of the population using public and pri - vate transport systems , number of males and females aged 10 – 17 years and 18 – 34 years , White and non - White members of the population , individuals with bachelor’s degrees or higher , and those with associate degrees or lower . Land use data were obtained from the U . S . Geological Survey , sidewalk and bus stop shapefiles were derived from Austin’s Open Data Portal , and the loca - tions of grocery stores , restaurants , and educational cen - ters were acquired from SafeGraph . Finally , we utilized ArcGIS Pro to calculate the land use entropy index , as outlined by Song et al . ( 46 ) , the percentage of sidewalks present , the distance from the centroid of each census tract to downtown , and the percentage of grocery stores , restaurants , and educational centers per census tract . We assumed that the independent variables ( i . e . , socio - economic factors , land use , percentages related to loca - tions of interests , etc . ) did not change from 2019 to 2020 . Table 2 summarizes the summary statistics of the vari - ables used in our data analysis . Results We first analyzed e - scooter trip durations using Kaplan – Meier ( K – M ) curves , which are widely employed in clini - cal and fundamental research . The K – M curve repre - sents the probability of completing an e - scooter trip at a certain time interval . As shown in Figure 1 , the horizon - tal x - axis represents trip duration expressed in minutes , and the y - axis indicates the proportion of the sample who completed a trip in t minutes or more . The compari - son of the two curves revealed that users tended to go on longer e - scooter trips in 2020 than in 2019 which is in line with those of previous studies ( 47 , 48 ) who reported an average increase of nearly 34 % during the pandemic . Considering that various factors contribute to e - scooter ridership , we estimated four Weibull survival models using STATA and used a 95 % confidence interval to assess the significance of the covariates . The results are summarized in Table 2 . 634 Transportation Research Record 2677 ( 4 ) Non - Spatial Models With regard to the 2019 non - spatial model , all the vari - ables were significant , except the ratio of White to non - White members of the population and the ratio of indi - viduals with bachelor’s degrees or higher to those having associate degrees or lower ( Table 3 ) . As for the 2020 non - spatial model , the ratio of males aged 10 – 17 years to their female counterparts and the ratio of White to non - White members of the population of this age range were non - significant . The results indicated that the aggregate travel time to work was significant in non - spatial Models 1 and 3 . Nevertheless , the findings reflected negative and positive signs in Models 1 and 2 , respectively , implying that increases in aggregate travel time , with all other variables held constant , were associated with reduced and increased hazard rates in 2019 and 2020 , respectively . In other words , before the pandemic , travels via e - scooter were longer in census tracts where residents had high aggregate travel time to work than in census tracts where residents exhibited low aggregate travel time to work . However , this trend was reversed in 2020—a contrast that seems reasonable , as people in census tracts with high aggregate travel time are likely to use personal vehi - cles to travel to work . Therefore , most of the e - scooter trips in these areas tended to be for leisure purposes—a behavior that was altered by the COVID - 19 global out - break given the limited places to visit ( 49 ) . As for median household income , its coefficients had negative signs in Models 1 and 3 ( non - spatial ) , suggesting that increases in household income , with all other vari - ables held constant , were associated with reduced hazard rates . That is , e - scooter users in high - income census tracts tended toward longer e - scooter trips before and during the pandemic . In other word , a one unit ( $ 1 , 000 ) increase in the median annual household income , while other vari - ables are held constant , will decrease the hazard rate by 0 . 5 % and 0 . 3 % respectively ( increase the travel time ) . In a similar vein , Caspi et al . ( 36 ) reported that high income is associated with low e - scooter travel . These findings , in combination , suggest that in census tracts where house - holds earn high incomes , people tend to go on fewer e - scooter trips of long durations because high earners reside in neighborhoods typified by mixed land use .

Azimian and Jiao 635 With regard to the ratio of public transport users to private transport users , its positive signs in both the non - spatial models indicated that before and during the pan - demic , e - scooter travel was of low durations in census tracts with a high proportion of public transport users . This finding may be explained by noting that most tran - sit users reside within central tracts and close to business centers . They may also use e - scooters to connect to tran - sit stations ( 10 ) , which are generally short trips . Additionally , the comparison of hazard ratios indicates that an increase in the ratio of public transport users to private transport users increases the hazard rate by 28 . 9 % and 41 . 6 % in 2019 and 2020 , respectively . On the matter of the ratio of males to females aged 10 – 17 years , the positive sign of this variable in Model 1 reflected that in 2019 , the e - scooter trip durations in cen - sus tracts with a high ratio of male to female teens tended to be lower than those in census tracts with a low ratio . No specific pattern was observed in 2020 . In contrast , when it came to the ratio of males to females aged 18 – 34 years , which had negative coefficients in both the non - spatial models , the opposite interpretation could be drawn . To wit , census tracts with a high ratio of 18 - to 34 - year - old males to females were correlated with long e - scooter trips . This contrast can be explained noting that that most male teenagers use e - scooters for leisure activi - ties and riding around , whereas adult males are more likely to use such vehicles for commuting to work and doing household errands , which take more time . Concerning educational levels , census tracts with a high ratio of individuals with bachelor’s degrees or greater to those with associate degrees or lower were pre - disposed toward long e - scooter travels during the pan - demic compared with census tracts typified by a low ratio . However , no specific trend was observed before the pandemic . Such disparity may be because individuals with bachelor’s degrees or higher often relying on public transport systems ( 50 ) were likely to switch to other modes of transport , including e - scooters , during the pan - demic to avoid the risk of COVID - 19 contradiction ( 51 ) . Focusing on built environment factors , sidewalks had negative signs and hazard ratios close to zero in both the non - spatial models , suggesting that in census tracts with a considerable proportion of sidewalks , e - scooter users Table 3 .

Hazards ratio associated with a variable is given by the exponent of its coefficient . Hazard ratio is interpreted as the proportional change in hazard when a variable change by one unit . * Denotes variables significant at 5 % . 636 Transportation Research Record 2677 ( 4 ) tended to go on much longer trips before and during the pandemic compared with census tracts with minimal sidewalks . Similarly , distance to downtown and the land use entropy index were inversely proportional to hazard rates , indicating that the further a census tract’s distance from downtown and the greater the complexity of land use within the census tract , the higher the probability of long e - scooter trip durations before and during the pan - demic . Surprisingly , census tracts with numerous bus stops were inclined to exhibit high e - scooter trip dura - tions , possibly because of the occurrence of a complex land use mix in these areas . Additionally , points of inter - est , such as grocery stores , restaurants , and educational centers , were significant and proportional to hazard rates . Put differently , the higher the number of points of interest , the greater the likelihood of short e - scooter trips . This finding is fairly reasonable , as e - scooter users go on short trips because of increased accessibility . Spatial Models After the random effect terms were accounted for , some variables that were significant in Models 1 and 3 ( e . g . , aggregate travel time to work and the ratio of public transport users to private transport users ) were no longer significant in Models 2 and 4 . This can be explained by the significant and systematic variance among the vari - ables across space . The use of random effect terms in the models captured the variations used to estimate the fixed effect parameters in the basic models ( Models 1 and 3 ) . As a result , these variables became non - significant ( 25 ) . Although the spatial models had fewer significant vari - ables and might seem less useful for planning and prac - tice , the insight concerning the inclusion of random effect terms is valuable , as these terms captured unobserved characteristics that vary across space . This highlights the need for the further identification of meaningful factors that can be used for planning and policy purposes . Figure 2 illustrates the changes in random effect esti - mates ( Model 4 versus Model 2 ) , which were classified into two types : negative values ( red highlight in the fig - ure ) and positive values ( green highlight in the figure ) , which show areas where unobserved factors were inclined to increase and decrease e - scooter trip durations during the pandemic , respectively . Even though the map revealed an overall random pattern in the study area , we can still observe a cluster of red census tracts in eastern Austin . According to Luna et al . ( 52 ) and Tu et al . ( 53 ) , these locations are historically known as low - and middle - income communities with a large proportion of non - White inhabitants who are highly dependent on public transportation systems . It therefore makes intui - tive sense that some of the residents in these localities shifted from public transport systems to e - scooters owing to fear of disease contraction and traveled more dis - tances to reach their destinations . By contrast , a big clus - ter of green census tracts can be observed in central part , which are home to high - income families . This finding can be supported by noting that such people are inclined to be able to afford personal vehicles more than low - income individuals . They were therefore more likely to use e - scooters for leisure , but such activities were signifi - cantly reduced during the pandemic . Conclusion This study used 2019 and 2020 e - scooter data on Austin to explore the socio - economic and built environment fac - tors contributing to travel behaviors . In particular , we proposed spatial and non - spatial models to identify the factors affecting e - scooter trip durations before and dur - ing the pandemic . The results confirmed changes in e - scooter trip durations in census tracts with residents who had high aggregate travel time to work and in census tracts with a substantial proportion of individuals with bachelor’s degrees or higher . Additionally , built environ - ment factors , such as sidewalks , distance to downtown , the land use entropy index , and percentage of bus stops present , were positively associated with e - scooter trip durations before and during the pandemic . By contrast , the percentage of restaurants , grocery stores , and educa - tional centers present were negatively correlated with e - scooter trip durations during both periods . Figure 2 . Changes in random effect estimates . Azimian and Jiao 637 In general , the comparison of spatial models high - lighted a slight increase or decrease in some variables’ coefficients in the 2020 model compared with the 2019 version . Note that this finding may not explicitly indicate whether trip duration changed or remained constant dur - ing the pandemic because of the limited number of vari - ables used in the model ( Many other important variables were disregarded given data limitations ) . However , the spatial models reflect that the 2020 model has a smaller coefficient than its 2019 counterpart , suggesting that , on average , when all variables are set to zero , travel time likely increased during the pandemic ( 2020 ) compared with 2019 . This finding also aligns with Figure 1 . Concerning policy implications , as many low - income families may rely on e - scooters to avoid the risk of COVID - 19 infection , it is critical to increase the mileage of such vehicles beyond core urban areas by upgrading batteries and installing charging stations across the city . E - scooters are placed in dense downtown areas and other districts where high levels of use and revenue gen - eration are expected . A necessary requirement , therefore , is to extend e - scooter service areas to communities with considerable low to zero - vehicle households ( e . g . , eastern Austin ) , where residents are encountering difficulty in accessing the public transportation system to a greater extent than that experienced in the pre - pandemic era ( 35 , 54 ) . Policymakers can address such problems and improve equity for residents of these areas , especially e - scooter users , by expediting the provision of improved infrastructure , such sidewalks and bike lanes ( 55 ) . As with any other research , the current work is encumbered by various limitations which should be con - sidered in future works . First , to better help transporta - tion planners and decision makers understand travel patterns during the pandemic , it is essential to investigate the extent to which people turned to micro - mobility devices to avoid subways and buses . Second , the e - scooter data used in this study lack individual - level socio - demographic factors , such as age , gender , and eth - nicity . A critical measure is to assess the effects of such factors on e - scooter trip durations to better understand whether e - scooter sharing services satisfy equity goals and serve target populations . Third and finally , it is highly recommended to utilize mode - specific variables to study how e - scooters are used as alternatives to other transport modes ( public transport in particular during the pandemic ) and therefore what their role is in making transport systems more resilient .
