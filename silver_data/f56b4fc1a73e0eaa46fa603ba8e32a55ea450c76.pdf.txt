BlueEye – A System for Proximity Detection Using Bluetooth on Mobile Phones Abstract Interesting applications of crowdsensing include measurement of crowdedness at public places and evaluating the extent of social interactions between people , at large gatherings . These require enabling the accurate estimation of proximity between two or more people . Since mobile phones have emerged as the most ubiquitous sensing and computing platform , carried by almost all people close to their body , it is logical to use the same for proximity detection . Further , in order to motivate people to use such application , it is necessary to estimate distances accurately , using only short blocks of sampled signal strengths . In this paper the authors present a mobile based proximity detection system , codenamed BlueEye which is based on Bluetooth . To achieve better distance estimates , BlueEye proposes a new form of path loss model which takes into account the relative orientation of mobile phones . The results show enhanced distance estimates when the separation between devices is less than 8 feet .

Toyosawa et al . [ 1 ] approached the problem of crowdedness measurement using infrastructure based sensing , but it makes the solution cost ineffective . Liu et al . [ 2 ] makes an attempt to detect crowded spots in a city traffic using participatory sensing of vehicles . However crowd and large queues are also a routine part of public transportation in large cities , which can be detected and managed using crowdsensing . Though the primary part of crowdedness measurement involves sensing of the location , sensing of proximity also plays very important part in determining people density . Also , for extraction of social and community context , one important aspect is the capturing of face - to - face interaction between people , which provides an indication of offline interactions for social behavior modeling . Liu et al . [ 3 ] describe face - to - face interactions and the importance of proximity . Since mobile phones have become the most popular pervasive computing platform of today , it‟s only logical to attempt the proximity detection problem using mobile phones . Mobile crowdsensing has been discussed in various literatures including [ 4 ] . Since users normally carry their mobile phones pretty close to their body like in pocket or a hostler or carry case etc . , detecting proximity would mean detecting distance between two mobile devices . Mobile devices are equipped with multiple radio communication protocols , out of which Bluetooth and WiFi , both use 2 . 4GHz , ISM ( Industrial Scientific and Medical ) band working in peer - to - peer mode that can be used for such measurements . However , phone WiFi often works in infrastructure mode only which makes it improbable for true peer - to - peer applications . Also , a larger number of mobile phones have some version of Bluetooth compared to the number of WiFi equipped phones . This prompts us to choose Bluetooth as the favored technique for proximity detection in project BlueEye . The use of Bluetooth for detection of proximity between people has also been proposed by [ 3 , 5 ] . The authors of [ 3 ] clearly state that “the problem of proximity estimation is complicated by the fact that the measurement must be quite precise ( 1 - 1 . 5m ) and can cover a wide variety of environments . Existing approaches such as GPS and WiFi triangulation are insufficient to meet the requirements of accuracy and flexibility " . Madan et al . [ 5 ] mention that “Due to API limitations with Windows Mobile 6 . x , signal strength was not available to the sensing application . ” However with the advent of Android TM Smartphone platforms , the API ( Application Programming Interface ) to read RSSI ( Received Signal Strength Indication ) has been opened and we have based our work in BlueEye on the same . However , there are specific challenges in accurate distance measurement from Bluetooth RSSI as pointed out by [ 6 , 7 ] , especially in indoor environments due to noise generated by multipath . Such attempts have stated that the noise is random and primarily Figure 1 . RSSI variation with space and time Figure 2 . Relative Orientations Figure 3 . Effect of Orientation on RSSI Session : PUCAA : 1st International Workshop on Pervasive Urban Crowdsensing Architecture and Applications UbiComp’13 , September 8 – 12 , 2013 , Zurich , Switzerland 1136 used statistical methods to minimize the same . However as [ 8 ] points out , having huge training data sets may not be feasible for participatory mobile applications , since users are unlikely to give consent to the use of their personal phones ( for such application ) if the energy consumption of these are found to be high . Hence , a potential success of BlueEye also demands that the measurement and evaluation are performed in a short time using a limited number of samples . Prior approaches have reported an accuracy of around 1 meter ( ~ 3 . 08 feet ) when reporting distances . This may be good for localization but as Liu et al . [ 3 ] point out that the average distances for face - to - face interactions between two people is 1 . 52 meters , hence an accuracy of 1m range is not good enough for such applications . The authors have used a modified path loss model that reduces error to 13 . 8 % over a variety of regions . Intuitively , it can be understood that the maximum distance for such interactions should not exceed 3 meters . Our initial results using BlueEye show an average error of around 5 % over short distances , which comes to ±0 . 16 meters accuracy for 3 meters distance . Based on the above facts , we decided to remodel the wireless propagation channel for Bluetooth operation over close distances , using only Smartphones . In this paper we present BlueEye a system for proximity detection , based on a modified channel propagation model for ISM band radio signals , which provides better than foot level accuracy over short distances . The system works with limited number of RSSI measurements by using a method based on k - means clustering [ 9 ] . Also every environment needs to be calibrated only once since spiky noise is canceled by choosing group medians of RSSI values . The foundation of the proposed model is based on work by Liberti et al . [ 10 ] , where the channel model is considered to be a power decay function and the multipath noise is modeled as lognormal distribution with standard deviation of σ ( dB ) . Based on the conclusions drawn from extensive measurements and published literature , the path loss exponent is remodeled so that the model closely follows the damped sinusoidal nature of real profile seen for close distances ( < 3m typically ) . The measurement of crowdedness at a particular location is actually the measure of people density at that location . One way to achieve this can be counting the number of mobile devices at a location by estimating their positions . However , some intelligent measurement technique is required due to the diversity in environment and phones . In outdoor environment , Smartphones can report their location using GPS , whereas in indoors , the same can be achieved using means of indoor localization using WiFi etc . However , there is a substantial population in developing nations , where overcrowding is a major problem , who use feature - phones ( for example Nokia X series phones ) . These phones do not have WiFi or GPS ; however they have coarse localization using GSM triangulation . They do however have Bluetooth radio and also these phones can be kept in discoverable mode forever . Hence if a Smartphone application can detect the number of Bluetooth peers in near vicinity , it has a much comprehensive measure of crowdedness . Kjeldskov et al . [ 17 ] provides a method whereby Bluetooth peers are counted at a location , while this shall provide the notion of presence ; it shall not provide the density factor accurately . However if the same Bluetooth signal , meaning Received Signal Strength Indicator ( RSSI ) can be used to estimate the distance that separates the Figure 4 . Fitting of our model vs . the power decay model on real data Figure 5 . Zero Crossing Points for a RSSI measurement using our model Session : PUCAA : 1st International Workshop on Pervasive Urban Crowdsensing Architecture and Applications UbiComp’13 , September 8 – 12 , 2013 , Zurich , Switzerland 1137 persons , it can be used to estimate the density factor much better along with presence . This method can also be extended to estimate face - to - face interaction between people in offices , malls etc . Banerjee et al . [ 18 ] provides a similar application and mentions a median error of 0 . 9 meters in field testing . However using our model we have found a mean error of ~ 0 . 2 meters for distances up to 3 meters which is good for discovering peers in crowded environments . Basic Theory The Modified Wireless Path - loss Model In the light of the problem statement , it is understood that a better modeling of the indoor propagation path , at Bluetooth‟s operating frequency 2 . 4GHz , is imperative . Indoor propagation modeling is a formidable job , given that fact that a number of phenomena like scattering , reflection , diffraction etc . gives rise to multipath effects resulting in uncertainty in signal strength estimation at a given location [ 12 ] . A number of experimental observations and potential models have been described in [ 13 , 14 ] . Using the standard free - space radio propagation formulation , it is possible to represent the measured received signal strength indicator ( RSSI M ) as ( 1 ) In equation 1 , n = 2 for free - space and n > 2 ( empirically adjusted ) for RF challenged environment like office indoor , as example . In typical path loss model [ 10 ] , n takes multiple values , for office buildings , ranging from 2 . 76 to 4 . 33 , based on location type . In addition , the term X σ was introduced in Rappaports path loss model to account for slow - fading phenomenon in RF challenged environment like office setup with cubicles . X σ is a zero - mean lognormal distributed random variable with σ ( dB ) ranging from 4 . 3 to 12 . 8 for different location in office premises . The range of σ is somewhat different at 2400 MHz . If results of [ 3 , 10 , 14 , 15 , 16 ] are closely observed , for close distances ( < 5m ) between transmitter and receiver , the path loss profile in dB displays „hidden‟ spatial periodicity , on which random variations ( in signal strength ) are superimposed . Authors in [ 16 ] have presented simulation ( 2 - D ray tracing model ) based results at 2400MHz . Chethan at al . [ 15 ] presented similar line - of - sight ( LOS ) measurements with antenna height of 1 . 2m . These are also measured in narrow , confined office space . Moreover , [ 15 ] demonstrates that if RSSI measurements taken for multiple polarizations are combined , it leads to a much improved propagation model . Comparing the results presented in [ 15 , 16 ] , we also estimate the possible implications of antenna height on received signal strength . At lower heights [ 16 ] , the RSSI measurements are less than free - space prediction by 16 - 30dB ; whereas at moderate heights [ 15 ] such difference is 8 – 12dB . Measurements were carried out to investigate ( a ) the effect of relative orientation between the two Smartphones ( Tx & Rx ) carried by two persons ( b ) signal strength variations with finer granularity . All the measurements were carried out while the Smartphone was being carried by a person . Figure 1 shows one set of RSSI measurements that depict typical temporal variations in a dense cubicle based office floor : 4 th floor of a multi - floor building . These include measurements for different relative orientations between the two Smartphones . The notion of “relative orientation” between Figure 6 . Client side calibration Session : PUCAA : 1st International Workshop on Pervasive Urban Crowdsensing Architecture and Applications UbiComp’13 , September 8 – 12 , 2013 , Zurich , Switzerland 1138 the transmitter and receiver is depicted in Figure 2 , whereby if two phones are kept screen - flat on the palm with Y axis in same direction , it shall be a “CO” and if one is flipped 90 degrees , the orientation becomes cross . Figure 3 displays the RSSI measurement carried out for different relative orientations . We found that for a given static environment , the spatial variation measurement can be repeated . Hence , we propose a new form of statistical model in equation 2 for propagation path based on regression analysis on measured data . We consider the path - loss exponent as similar in nature to a weakly stationary process and model it in terms of harmonic components ; the random nature ( of signal strength ) is incorporated in the phase component . The path - loss exponent , therefore , is location dependent and also , it attributes the variance with a given harmonic component . It is to be noted that the proposed model is considered valid only for LOS measurements . ( 2 ) Where ( 3 ) Where , c m and c n stand for constants which are properties of a given environment . For the present case , we consider the dominant mode only i . e . m = 1 . Going forward , we denote c m = c 1 and c n = c 2 . Greater accuracy will be obtained if the higher order modes are also considered . Ω stands for spatial wavelength of the channel ( approximately determined from a limited set of measurements ) . θ is a random phase lag introduced due to relative orientation of receiver and transmitter , with value ranging from 0 < θ < π / 2 . Using the above equations and adjusting the values of „c 1 ‟ and „c 2 ‟ for a given location , we get a reasonable good fit of the RSSI function with indoor multipath effects for distances up to ~ 10 - 12 feet , Ω , the spatial frequency accounts for the effect of multipath on propagation loss for a given RF antenna polarization and environment . We have found the variation to follow a near sinusoidal profile . Our findings are entirely empirical and the observation is obtained from repeated measurements under various indoor environments . The value of Ω is seen to be varying between 7 . 8 – 8 . 2 feet and the variation does not have significant effect on the results obtained . This model fits the experimentally captured data better than the classical model given by equation 2 . The result is shown in Figure 4 . However , it is imperative to note that due to the sinusoidal nature of the curve , it is not possible to directly estimate the distance from an RSSI M value as there will be multiple values of distances satisfying the equation as shown in Figure 5 . To overcome this problem we use a statistical technique to determine the distance as detailed in the next sub - section . Determination of Distance from RSSI In order to estimate the distance between two persons using Bluetooth , we need to obtain all possible solutions of equations 2 & 3 . Such solutions , gathered from a number of consecutive RSSI measurements are used as input to k - means clustering [ 9 ] module because for mostly static environment , majority of solutions will occur near the actual distance between the devices . Hence the centroid of the most populous cluster shall provide us with the distance estimate . This becomes the working principle of the application which is described in the next section . Figure 7 . Server side calibration Session : PUCAA : 1st International Workshop on Pervasive Urban Crowdsensing Architecture and Applications UbiComp’13 , September 8 – 12 , 2013 , Zurich , Switzerland 1139 Application Details System Components The application also has two entities involved , one is an Android smartphone that reads the RSSI values and sends them to a backend server , and a backend server that performs the complex analytics and provides the results back to the client . Method Details T HE CALIBRATION MODE In the calibration mode , the constants for an environment are determined . In order to achieve this , ground truth is collected for that environment whereby the user annotates RSSI readings for distances from 1 – 8 feet at the concerned location . Since RSSI readings often contain unwanted “spikes” and “troughs” owing to interference and channel hopping etc . we take readings in groups of 5 for each annotated distance and use only the median value of those 5 observations for our calculation . Since we take multiple measurements and in known orientations ( θ = 0 ) , and we have only two undetermined constants as per our proposed model , it becomes typically over - determined with more equations than unknowns . Hence we use a Least Square Estimate ( LSE ) based method to determine the constants . The client side application logic is summarized in Figure 6 , whereas the server side logic is captured in Figure 7 . T HE DETERMINATION MODE In the determination phase , for every value of RSSI received , the application uses the c m and c n values stored for that room id to calculate the possible distances with value of θ set at ∏ / 4 ( to average out the errors due to random and unknown relative orientations ) . Using environmental constants in the model we determine the possible values of distances from the observed value of RSSI . However , one value of RSSI shall produce multiple values of distance . So we accumulate all values for distances between 2 and 10 feet by solving equation ( 2 ) . We call these values as “zero crossing points ( ZCP ) ” . For distance estimated similarly from subsequent RSSI values , k - means clustering is used to determine intermittent and final distance estimates as shown in Figure 8 . Results A number of experiments were conducted in different type of indoor spaces ( mostly office spaces ) and BlueEye was used to estimate distance from observed RSSI values , for each distance we have taken a series of RSSI measurements ; estimate distance from each measured value of RSSI and then clustered to find the distance estimate as per application logic . The experiments were carried out using a the following phones : transmitters - Apple iPhone , Nokia E63 and Samsung Corby , receivers - Intel Xolo 800 , Samsung Galaxy Y and Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 , all running Android TM . The results were gathered over a period of time as mentioned in the tables to show that there was little temporal effect on the method . Experimental Setup Three different locations were chosen for validating the application . The three rooms are denoted as LOC I , LOC II and LOC III . LOC I is depicted in Figure 9 as an open indoor environment which is a lab room setup with one door and three lab benches ( desks ) placed along the three walls ; the fourth wall is equipped with a white - board and hence it is free from furnishings . The readings were taken in the vacant space at the center of the room . The second location , named LOC II is an Figure 8 . Distance Estimation Session : PUCAA : 1st International Workshop on Pervasive Urban Crowdsensing Architecture and Applications UbiComp’13 , September 8 – 12 , 2013 , Zurich , Switzerland 1140 office corridor which is a long open space with close bounds breadthwise as depicted in Figure 10 . The corridor is the passage to an array of office spaces and walk paths along its length . The experiments were carried on in the length of the passage . The passage is equipped with two doors on either end lengthwise . The third and final location named LOC III is a typical office room space with cubicle like arrangement which is a near close space as shown in Figure 11 . The room is an enclosure of work desks with a small vacant space in the middle where the experiments were carried out . The phones were also allowed to migrate to the walk paths from the central location as they are of comparative dimensions . Calibration Mode Using our application , the three locations described in previous section have been calibrated to train the model accordingly . Table 1 show the results for the calibration phase which ends with the determination of c 1 and c 2 for that environment using Least Square Estimation technique . Determination Mode In the determination phase we illustrate how using our approach the distance estimate made through the model converges with iterative clustering . Figure 12 shows this convergence phenomenon . Table 2 shows results taken for various distances in a fixed indoor location , with various Number of Iterations ( NOI ) of clustering . Table 3 provides the error of estimation in close distances across the three locations that have been described in Experimental Setup section . The error percentage increases with distances ~ 10 feet as shown in Table 4 .

Distance Estimates for Known Distances ( Using Consecutive Iterations of RSSI Measurements , Each Iteration Consists of 5 RSSI Values ) Conclusion and Future Work In this paper we have shown that BlueEye can be effectively used to detect proximity between people . We have also outlined that the distances estimated using BlueEye are more accurate than those provided by previous approaches in indoor environments . Our future work includes extending the model to outdoor spaces . Also by reducing the time taken for detecting proximity , BlueEye can be coupled with inertial navigation systems ( INS ) [ 11 ] and provide a comprehensive social interaction and crowdedness measurement model using principles of crowdsensing .
