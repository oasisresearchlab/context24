Reservosomes are large round vesicles located at the posterior end of epimastigote forms of the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi , the etiological agent of Chagas disease . They are the specific end organelles of the endocytosis pathway of T . cruzi , and they play key roles in nutrient uptake and cell differentiation . These lysosome - like organelles accumulate ingested macromolecules and contain large amounts of a major cysteine proteinase ( cruzipain or GP57 / 51 protein ) . Aim of this study was to produce a monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) against a recombinant T . cruzi cruzipain ( TcCruzipain ) that specifically labels the reservosomes . BALB / c mice were immunized with purified recombinant TcCruzipain to obtain the mAb . After fusion of isolated splenocytes with myeloma cells and screening , a mAb was obtained by limiting dilution and characterized by capture ELISA . We report here the production of a kappa - positive monoclonal IgG antibody ( mAb CZP - 315 . D9 ) that recognizes recombinant TcCruzipain . This mAb binds preferentially to a protein with a molecular weight of about 50kDa on western blots and specifically labels reservosomes by immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscopy . The monoclonal CZP - 315 . D9 constitutes a potentially powerful marker for use in studies on the function of reservosomes of T . cruzi . 1 . Introduction The kinetoplastid protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi is the eti - ological agent of Chagas disease , which affects about eight million people in the 18 countries in which it is endemic , mostly in Latin America [ 1 , 2 ] . This parasite has a complex life cycle , with two developmental stages in the insect host ( replicative epimastigotes and infective metacyclic trypo - mastigotes ) and two stages in mammalian hosts ( replicative intracellular amastigotes and infective bloodstream trypo - mastigotes ) . Macromolecule endocytosis plays an important role in this flagellate protozoan , allowing survival in the very different environments it colonizes . The endocytosis pathway has been elucidated mainly in epimastigote forms : molecules enter the cells via the flagellar pocket and cytostome , both located in the anterior region of the cell and accumulate in the reservosomes , the end compartments of the endocytosis pathway [ 3 ‚Äì 6 ] . Reservosomes are large round vesicles located at the pos - terior end of T . cruzi epimastigotes [ 7 ] . The lack of molecular markers for cytoplasmic compartments in this parasite makes it difficult to clarify all the functions of reservosomes , which have characteristics typical of prelysosomes , lysosomes , and recycling compartments [ 8 ] . Subcellular localization [ 9 ] and proteomics [ 10 ] experiments have shown reservosomes to contain large amounts of a cysteine proteinase , known as cruzipain [ 11 ] or GP57 / 51 [ 12 ] . The native GP57 / 51 has been isolated from epimastigotes and used to generate a monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) [ 13 ] . Subcellular localization experiments demonstrated the presence of this protein in vesicles of the endosomal / lysosomal system and close to the flagellar pocket [ 12 , 14 ] . At about the same time , the native Hindawi Publishing Corporation BioMed Research International Volume 2014 , Article ID 714749 , 9 pages http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1155 / 2014 / 714749 2 BioMed Research International cysteine proteinase ( cruzipain ) was isolated and character - ized [ 11 , 15 ] . A monospecific rabbit polyclonal antibody against this protein labeled reservosomes , the membrane lining the cell body and flagellum , the inside of the flagellar pocket , and even the cytostome [ 16 ] . Thus , no antibody directed against cruzipain has yet been reported to label reservosomes specifically , despite the accumulation of the enzyme in this organelle . We report here the characterization of a mouse mon - oclonal antibody ( mAb CZP - 315 . D9 ) against recombinant T . cruzi cruzipain ( TcCruzipain ) that specifically recognizes reservosomes . This mAb has potential as a powerful molecu - lar marker for studies on the function of this organelle . 2 . Materials and Methods 2 . 1 . Ethics Statement .

Cultured epimastigotes of T . cruzi clone Dm28c [ 17 ] were maintained at 28 ‚àò C by weekly passages in liver infusion tryptose ( LIT ) medium [ 18 ] supplemented with 10 % heat - inactivated fetal calf serum ( FCS ) . For TcCruzipain cloning , DNA was isolated by phenol - chloroform extraction [ 19 ] , from three - day - old cultures of epimastigotes . 2 . 4 . Construction and Purification of Recombinant TcCruzipain Protein . The whole gene encoding T . cruzi cruzipain ( TcCruzipain , 1404 bp , gene ID Tc00 . 1047053507603 . 260 ) was used to design primers ( Forward : 5 Û∏Ä† - ATGTCTGGCTGGGCTCGTGCGCTG - 3 Û∏Ä† and Reverse : 5 Û∏Ä† - TCAGAGGCGACGATGACGGCTGTGGGTA - 3 Û∏Ä† ) with recombination sites ( attBs ) for use on the Gateway cloning platform ( Life Technologies - Invitrogen , USA ) . Escherichia coli strain C43 + was used for recombinant protein production ( TcCruzipain + pDEST17 vector expressing a histidine tag ) , which was induced by incubating the cell culture for 7 h with 1 mM IPTG . The production of the recombinant protein ( 50 kDa TcCruzipain + 6 kDa histidine tag ) was confirmed by western blotting with a probe directed against the histidine tag , and the recombinant protein was purified from the polyacrylamide gel by elution . 2 . 5 . Construction of Recombinant Cruzipain Domains . The whole cruzipain gene was used for domain analysis by pFAM software ( Sanger Institute , Cambridge , UK ) . Cruzi - pain has three protein domains : pre - pro ( aminoacids 38 ‚Äì 94 ) , catalytic ( aminoacids 123 ‚Äì 335 ) , and C - terminal extension ( aminoacids 337 ‚Äì 417 ) . The nucleotide sequence encoding each protein domain was used to design specific primers , as follows : ( a ) pre - pro ( nucleotides 1 to 368 ) , Forward : 5 Û∏Ä† - ATG - TCTGGCTGGGCTCGTGCG - 3 Û∏Ä† and Reverse : 5 Û∏Ä† - CGCGCC - CAACTACCTCAACCTTCAC - 3 Û∏Ä† ; ( b ) catalytic ( nucleotides 369 to 1005 ) , Forward : 5 Û∏Ä† - CCCGCGGCAGTGGATTG - 3 Û∏Ä† and Reverse : 5 Û∏Ä† - CACCGCAGAGCTCGCCTCCTCC - 3 Û∏Ä† ; ( c ) C - terminal extension ( nucleotides 1011 to 1404 ) , Forward : 5 Û∏Ä† - GGTCCCGGTCCCACTCCTGAGCCA - 3 Û∏Ä† and Reverse : 5 Û∏Ä† - TCAGAGGCGGCGATGACGG - 3 Û∏Ä† . Primers had recombina - tion sites ( attBs ) for use on the Gateway cloning platform ( Life Technologies - Invitrogen , USA ) . Escherichia coli strain C43 + was used for recombinant protein production ( TcCruzipain protein domains + pDEST17 vector expressing a histidine tag ) , which was induced by incubating the cell culture for 4 h with 1 mM IPTG . Production of recombinant proteins was confirmed by western blot with a probe directed against the histidine tag . 2 . 6 . Monoclonal Antibody Production . Three male BALB / c mice ( 30 ‚Äì 45 - days old ) received four intraperitoneal doses of 20 ùúá g TcCruzipain + Alu - Gel - S and a last intravenous ( without Alu - Gel - S ) injection , separated by intervals of one week . The animals were checked before immunization for antibody cross reactivity with protein extracts of T . cruzi epimastigotes ( preimmune serum ) by western blot assay . The spleen of a TcCruzipain - reactive mouse was used in a cell fusion protocol [ 20 ] . Spleen cells were obtained by filtration , centrifugation , and washing and were fused with Ag8XP3653 myeloma cells ( generously supplied by Dr . Carlos R . Zanetti , from Laborat¬¥orio de Imunologia Aplicada , Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina , Brazil ) in the presence of 50 % polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) . After fusion , the cells were resuspended at a density of 2 . 5 √ó 10 6 cells / mL in RPMI medium supplemented with 20 % FCS and 100 ùúá L of this suspension was added to each well of a 96 - well plate . The cells were allowed to grow for 24 h at 37 ‚àò C , under an atmosphere containing 5 % CO 2 , and 100 ùúá L of HAT medium was then added to the cell culture . The medium was replaced every 48 h . Hybrid cells were selected BioMed Research International 3 over a period of 14 days , and the medium was then replaced with HT medium for an additional four days . Hybrid cells were selected and propagated in RPMI medium containing 20 % FCS . Positive hybridomas were selected by indirect ELISA , western blotting , and indirect immunofluorescence ( see below ) . The most stable hybridoma in cryosurvival assays [ 20 ] was cloned by limiting dilution . The SBA Clonotyping - HRP System ( Southern Biotech , Birmingham , USA ) , based on cap - ture ELISA , was used to identify mAb isotype , in accordance with the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions . Positive hybridomas and clones were cryopreserved at the Laborat¬¥orio de Biologia Celular ( ICC / FIOCRUZ - PR ) . 2 . 7 . ELISA . For indirect ELISA , recombinant TcCruzipain ( 0 . 15 ùúá g / well ) was adsorbed onto 96 - well immunoplates ( Nunc , Roskilde , Denmark ) by incubation overnight at 4 ‚àò C with sensitizing buffer ( 0 . 05 M sodium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate , pH 9 . 6 ) . The plates were then blocked by incubation for 1 h with 5 % nonfat milk powder in PBS supplemented with 0 . 01 % Tween 20 ( PBS - T ) . The hybridoma supernatants were added to the immunoplates and incubated for 1 h at 37 ‚àò C . The plates were washed five times with PBS - T and incubated for 1 h at 37 ‚àò C with HRP - conjugated goat anti - mouse IgG ( 1 : 4 , 000 ) . The plates were then washed five times with PBS - T and immunoreactivity was visualized with the SureBlue TMB Substrate , with optical density ( OD ) being read at 450 nm in an EL800 ELISA reader ( BioTek , Winooski , VT , USA ) . Only OD values higher than 0 . 300 were considered positive . 2 . 8 . Western Blot . For expression analysis of native cruzi - pain on T . cruzi epimastigotes , total protein extracts of the parasites were prepared by resuspending PBS - washed parasites ( 10 9 cells / mL ) in denaturing buffer A ( 40 mM Tris - HCl pH 6 . 8 ; 1 % SDS ; 360 mM ùõΩ - mercaptoethanol ) . PMSF ( 1 mM ) and E - 64 ( 100 ùúá M ) were used as protease inhibitors . Protein content was determined in a Bradford assay [ 21 ] . The samples were resuspended in denaturing buffer B ( 40 mM Tris - HCl pH 6 . 8 ; 1 % SDS ; 360 mM ùõΩ - mercaptoethanol ; 6 % glycerol ; 0 . 005 % bromophenol blue ) and boiled at 100 ‚àò C for 5 min . Protein extracts ( 15 ùúá g protein / lane ) were fractionated by SDS - PAGE in 10 % polyacrylamide gels and the result - ing bands were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes ( Hybond C , Amersham Biosciences , England ) , according to standard protocols [ 19 , 22 ] . Following protein transfer , the membranes were blocked by incubation with 5 % non - fat milk powder / 0 . 05 % Tween - 20 in PBS . The membranes were then incubated for 1 h with blocking buffer contain - ing preimmune serum ( diluted 1 : 200 ) , antirecombinant TcCruzipain polyclonal serum ( diluted 1 : 500 ) , antirecom - binant TcCruzipain hybridoma ( CZP - 315 ) supernatant , or antirecombinant TcCruzipain monoclonal antibody ( mAb CZP - 315 . D9 , diluted 1 : 100 ) . The membrane was washed three times in 0 . 05 % Tween - 20 / PBS and then incubated for 1 h with AP - conjugated rabbit anti - mouse IgG ( diluted 1 : 10 , 000 ) . A polyclonal antirecombinant actin ( TcActin ; diluted at 1 : 200 ) mouse serum [ 23 ] was used for normalization . The membrane was then washed three times with 0 . 05 % Tween - 20 / PBS and the reactive bands were visualized with BCIP - NBT solution , as described by the manufacturer . To verify the specificity of mAb CZP - 315 . D9 , whole protein extracts of E . coli ( 15 ùúá g protein / lane ) and purified recombinant TcCruzipain ( 2 ùúá g protein / lane ) were fraction - ated by SDS - PAGE in 10 % polyacrylamide gels , transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes , and incubated with either the antirecombinant TcCruzipain polyclonal serum ( diluted 1 : 1000 in blocking buffer ) or the mAb CZP - 315 . D9 ( diluted 1 : 100 in blocking buffer ) . The membrane was washed three times in 0 . 05 % Tween - 20 / PBS and then incubated for 1 h with AP - conjugated rabbit anti - mouse IgG ( diluted 1 : 10 , 000 ) . The membrane was then washed three times with 0 . 05 % Tween - 20 / PBS and the reactive bands were visualized with BCIP - NBT solution , as described by the manufacturer . For analysis of cruzipain domain labeling , protein ex - tracts of E . coli vector ( with cruzipain domains ) were frac - tionated by SDS - PAGE ( 15 ùúá g protein / lane ) in 10 % polyacry - lamide gels , transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes , and incubated with the antirecombinant TcCruzipain polyclonal serum ( diluted 1 : 1000 ) or with the mAb CZP - 315 . D9 ( diluted 1 : 100 ) . The experiment then continued was described above . 2 . 9 . Fluorescence Microscopy . T . cruzi epimastigotes were washed twice in PBS , fixed by incubation for 30 min with 4 % paraformaldehyde , permeabilized by incubation for 5 min with PBS / 0 . 5 % Triton , and incubated for one hour at 37 ‚àò C with preimmune serum diluted 1 : 150 in PBS pH 7 . 4 containing 1 . 5 % BSA ( incubation buffer ) , anti - TcCruzipain polyclonal serum diluted 1 : 500 in incubation buffer , anti - TcCruzipain hybridoma ( CZP - 315 ) supernatant , or antirecombinant TcCruzipain mAb ( CZP - 315 . D9 ) diluted 1 : 40 . Samples were washed three times with PBS and then incubated , in the same conditions , with goat anti - mouse secondary antibody coupled to AlexaFluor 488 or 594 diluted 1 : 600 in incubation buffer . The samples were washed three times with PBS , incubated for 5 min with 1 . 3 nM Hoechst 33342 ( DNA marker ) , and examined under a Leica SP5 confocal laser microscope ( Leica Microsystems , Wetzlar , Germany ) . We further analyzed colocalization of native cruzipain in the Golgi apparatus in transfected epimastigotes expressing the T . cruzi Golgi marker TcHIP / AC [ 24 ] . Three - day - old culture transfected epimastigotes were washed twice in PBS , fixed for 30 min with 4 % paraformaldehyde , and incubated for one hour at 37 ‚àò C with anti - TcCruzipain mouse polyclonal serum ( 1 : 500 ) and rabbit anti - protein A antibody ( 1 : 40 , 000 ) . The samples were washed three times in PBS and incubated , in the same conditions , with the secondary antibodies : goat anti - mouse antibody coupled to AlexaFluor 488 and goat anti - rabbit antibody coupled to AlexaFluor 594 ( both diluted 1 : 600 ) . Fluorescence microscopy was then carried out as described above . 2 . 10 . Endocytosis Assay . T . cruzi epimastigotes were washed twice in PBS and then subjected to nutritional stress in PBS for 15 min at 25 ‚àò C . They were then incubated for 30 min at 28 ‚àò C with transferrin coupled to Alexa 633 ( 1 mg / mL ) diluted 1 : 40 . This period was long enough for the ingested 4 BioMed Research International Table 1 : Characterization of mAb CZP - 315 . D9 with the SBA Clonotyping - HRP System .

D9 mAb diluted 1 : 40 in incubation buffer .

Culture epimastig - otes were collected by centrifugation , washed three times in phosphate buffer ( pH 7 . 2 ) , and fixed for 1 h at room tem - perature with 0 . 1 % glutaraldehyde + 4 % paraformaldehyde in 0 . 1 M phosphate buffer . The cells were then washed in phosphate buffer , dehydrated in graded ethanol series , and infiltrated overnight at low temperature ( ‚àí 20 ‚àò C ) with a 1 : 1 dilution of ethanol 100 % : Lowicryl K4M or Lowicryl K4M MonoStep resin ( EMS , Hatfield , PA , USA ) . After embedding for 6 h in pure resin , the samples were polymerized for 48 h at ‚àí 20 ‚àò C under UV light . Ultrathin sections ( 70 nm ) were collected on nickel grids , incubated for 30 min with 50 mM ammonium chloride in PBS ( pH 7 . 2 ) , and then incubated for 1 h with mAb CZP - 315 . D9 diluted 1 : 20 in incubation buffer . After washing in this buffer , the grids were incubated for 1 h with a rabbit anti - mouse antibody coupled to 10 nm gold particles diluted at 1 : 20 in incubation buffer . After washing in buffer and distilled water , the grids were stained for 45 min with 5 % uranyl acetate and for 5 min with lead citrate and observed in a JEOL 1200EXII transmission electron microscope operated at 80 kV . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . Production , Characterization , and Specificity of the Anti - TcCruzipain Monoclonal Antibody . The T . cruzi cruzipain gene was amplified , cloned ( as confirmed by sequencing ) , and expressed in E . coli , producing a 56 kDa recombinant protein ( 50 kDa of TcCruzipain sequence + 6 kDa of his - tag ) that was purified and used to immunize BALB / c mice . The mouse with the most responsive and specific anti - TcCruzipain serum ( as determined by western blotting and subcellular localization by indirect immunofluorescence ) was chosen for fusion of splenocytes with myeloma cells . Seven positive hybridomas were detected by indirect ELISA . The most stable hybridoma ( CZP - 315 ) was used to obtain clones by limiting dilution . An IgG1 isotype ( OD value : 1 . 105 ) and kappa - positive ( OD value : 0 . 459 ) monoclonal antibody ( mAb CZP - 315 . D9 ) was obtained after selection by indirect ELISA , western blotting , and indirect immunofluorescence assays ( Table 1 ) . A western blotting assay was performed to compare the reactivity of the anti - TcCruzipain polyclonal serum and the mAb CZP - 315 . D9 to E . coli protein extracts and to purified recombinant TcCruzipain . The anti - TcCruzipain serum rec - ognized three protein bands between 80 and 110 kDa in E . coli ( Figure 1 ( a ) , Ec lane 1 ) and several protein bands with the recombinant TcCruzipain ( Figure 1 ( a ) , Czp lane 1 ) , but with higher reactivity to a protein band between 50 and 60 kDa , compatible with TcCruzipain ( 50 kDa TcCruzipain + 6 kDa histidine tag ) . On the other hand , the mAb CZP - 315 . D9 recognized no protein bands in E . coli ( Figure 1 ( a ) , Ec lane 2 ) but recognized the protein band between 50 and 60 kDa in the purified TcCruzipain fraction ( Figure 1 ( a ) , Czp lane 2 ) . Furthermore , both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies recognized three protein bands below 50 kDa in the TcCruzipain fraction . We further assessed the specificity of the CZP - 315 . D9 mAb against whole - epimastigote extracts by western blot - ting . Both anti - TcCruzipain polyclonal serum and CZP - 315 hybridoma supernatant recognized two protein bands between 50 and 60 kDa , whereas the CZP - 315 . D9 mAb recognized mainly the protein band with about 50 kDa . The preimmune serum did not recognize any proteins . Actin ( 42 kDa ) , used for normalization , was detected with a poly - clonal anti - TcActin mouse serum ( Figure 1 ( b ) ) . Western blot assay was performed to determine which cruzipain domain ( pre - pro domain , catalytic domain or C - terminal extension ) was recognized by the polyclonal serum and by mAb CZP - 315 . D9 . While the polyclonal serum rec - ognized all protein domains and crossreacted with E . coli ( protein bands below 50 kDa , Figure 1 ( c ) ) , the mAb CZP - 315 . D9 did not , or weakly , recognize the pre - pro domain ( Figure 1 ( c ) ) . 3 . 2 . Localization of Cruzipain in Reservosomes and Colo - calization with Ingested Transferrin . T . cruzi epimastigotes were incubated with preimmune serum , anti - TcCruzipain polyclonal serum , CZP - 315 hybridoma supernatant , or mAb CZP - 315 . D9 . As expected , no labeling was observed with the preimmune serum ( Figure 2 ( a ) ) . The anti - TcCruzipain poly - clonal serum labeled several round spots at the posterior end of the parasites ( reservosomes ) and a single spot at the ante - rior end of the cells , lateral to the kinetoplast ( Figure 2 ( b ) ) , corresponding to the Golgi complex ( see below ) .

D9 recognized only the round spots ( reservosomes ) at the posterior end of the parasites ( Figures 2 ( c ) and 2 ( d ) ) . Incubation of TcHIP / AC transfectant epimastigotes with both anti - protein - A tag and anti - TcCruzipain polyclonal sera showed colocalization of the protein A tag and TcCruzipain at a single spot at the anterior end of the cells , lateral to the kinetoplast , corresponding to the single Golgi complex of the parasites ( Figures 2 ( g ) and 2 ( h ) ) . No colocalization was observed at the posterior end of the parasites , which displayed only cruzipain labeling in several round structures ( reservosomes ) . An endocytosis assay was performed to validate the mAb CZP - 315 . D9 . Alexa 633 - conjugated transferrin was internal - ized and directed to the reservosomes , where it colocalized with cruzipain labeling ( Figures 2 ( i ) ‚Äì 2 ( l ) ) . We further assessed the immunolocalization of cruzipain by transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) . After incubat - ing mAb CZP - 315 . D9 with ultrathin sections of epimastigote forms , gold labeling was found specifically in reservosomes ( Figure 3 ) . Weaker labeling was found in reservosomes from cells embedded with Lowicryl resin , which appeared elec - tronlucent ( Figures 3 ( a ) ‚Äì 3 ( c ) ) . More intense labeling was found in reservosomes from cells embedded with Lowicryl MonoStep resin ( Figures 3 ( d ) and 3 ( e ) ) , which appeared more electrondense . 4 . Discussion Reservosomes are large round vesicles at the posterior end of T . cruzi epimastigote forms , in which the macromolecules taken up by the parasites accumulate [ 3 ] . Reservosomes are thus specific end organelles of the endocytosis pathway of this protozoan and can be used as exclusive markers / targets for these parasites . Proteomics analyses have shown that reser - vosomes contain several lysosomal enzymes [ 10 ] , including a major cysteine proteinase known as cruzipain [ 11 ] or GP57 / 51 [ 12 ] . However , the antibodies against cruzipain currently available do not specifically target the reservosomes [ 11 , 12 ] . We , therefore , aimed to produce a monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) against recombinant cruzipain ( TcCruzipain ) that specifically labeled reservosomes . Indirect immunofluorescence assays to detect cruzipain in T . cruzi epimastigotes showed that ( a ) following incubation with a polyclonal serum against TcCruzipain , labeling was restricted to the reservosomes and in a single spot lateral to the kinetoplast and ( b ) following incubation with hybridoma supernatant and the mAb against TcCruzipain , labeling was restricted to the reservosomes . Immunolocalization of cruzipain by transmission electron microscopy showed gold labeling specifically in reservosomes . More intense labeling in electrondense reservosomes could be due to sample preservation in different resins ( Lowicryl K4M and Lowicryl K4M MonoStep ) . Previous antibodies against cruzipain have labeled reservosomes , the membrane lining the cell body and flagellum , the inside of the flagellar pocket , and even the cytostome [ 9 , 12 , 14 , 16 ] . Our monoclonal antibody , therefore , appears to be a suitable tool for the specific labeling of reservosomes . TcHIP is a marker of the Golgi apparatus of T . cruzi [ 24 ] . Incubation of TcHIP / AC - transfected epimastigotes with both anti - protein - A tag and anti - TcCruzipain polyclonal sera revealed colocalization of protein A and TcCruzipain in a single spot at the anterior end of the cells , close to the kinetoplast , in a region corresponding to the Golgi complex . Cruzipain is a glycoprotein that is edited in the Golgi complex 6 BioMed Research International Preimmune ( a ) Antiserum 1 : 500 ( b ) Hybridoma ( c ) mAb 1 : 40 ( d ) Antiserum 1 : 500 ( e ) Antiprotein A ( f ) Merged ( g ) Merged + Hoechst ( h ) mAb 1 : 40 ( i ) Transferrin / Alexa 633 ( j ) Hoechst ( k ) Merged ( l ) Figure 2 : Immunolocalization of cruzipain and its colocalization with TcHIP / AC and ingested transferrin in Trypanosoma cruzi epimastigotes .

Bars = 5 ùúá m . and then directed to the endosomal / lysosomal system via the trans - Golgi network [ 25 , 26 ] . Our polyclonal serum , therefore , also recognized immature cruzipain in transit through the Golgi complex , whereas the CZP - 315 hybridoma and CZP - 315 . D9 mAb recognized the mature cruzipain in the reservosomes . In western blot assays with whole extracts of T . cruzi epimastigote forms , both the anti - TcCruzipain serum and the CZP - 315 hybridoma supernatant recognized two protein bands between 50 and 60 kDa , whereas the CZP - 315 . D9 mAb reacted strongly with a protein band at about 50 kDa . Cruzi - pain is produced as a 57 kDa protein , from which 6 kDa is cleaved to generate the mature cysteine protease , which thus has a molecular weight of 51 kDa ( GP57 / 51 ) [ 12 ] . These data thus indicate that our CZP - 315 . D9 mAb recognizes mainly the mature enzyme in the reservosomes . Western blot assay to compare recognition of the anti - TcCruzipain polyclonal serum and the mAb CZP - 315 . D9 to purified recombinant TcCruzipain showed that the monoclonal recognized mainly a protein band between 50 and 60 kDa ( 50 kDa TcCruzipain + 6 kDa histidine tag ) , thus confirming the higher specificity of this mAb , as compared to a polyclonal antiserum . Both poly - clonal and monoclonal antibodies recognized three protein bands below 50 kDa in a TcCruzipain fraction , probably due to proteolysis . Cruzipain has three protein domains : pre - pro , catalytic , and C - terminal extension [ 27 ] . Our polyclonal serum rec - ognized all protein domains by western blot analysis . On the other hand , mAb CZP - 315 . D9 recognized the catalytic domain and the C - terminal extension but did not , or weakly , recognize the pre - pro domain . This double binding can be dependent on conformational epitopes .

D9 does not recognize the immature cruzipain present in the Golgi complex . An endocytosis assay was carried out with epimastigotes to validate the mAb CZP - 315 . D9 . Transferrin ingested by the parasites was clearly colocalized with cruzipain labeling in the reservosomes . Thus , we demonstrate here , for the first time , the production of a specific mAb against reservosomal cruzipain . Monoclonal antibodies present several advantages over polyclonal sera , such as specificity , reproducibility , and ethical advantages [ 28 ] . The mAb produced in this study thus appears to be a potentially powerful molecular marker for studies on the function of this species - specific organelle , which plays an important role in the endocytosis of nutrients and cell differentiation ( metacyclogenesis ) in T . cruzi [ 29 , 30 ] . 5 . Conclusions We report here the production of a kappa - positive mon - oclonal IgG antibody ( mAb CZP - 315 . D9 ) that recognizes recombinant T . cruzi cruzipain ( TcCruzipain ) . This mAb binds mainly to a protein with a molecular weight of about 50 kDa on western blots and specifically labels reservosomes in T . cruzi epimastigotes by immunofluorescence and trans - mission electron microscopy . It thus constitutes a potentially powerful marker for use in studies on the function of these organelles .
