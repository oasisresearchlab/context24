Persuasive Natural Language Generation - A Literature Review Sebastian Duerr Peter A . Gloor MIT Center for Collective Intelligence contact : { sduerr , pgloor } @ mit . edu This literature review focuses on the use of Natural Language Generation ( NLG ) to automatically detect and generate persuasive texts . Extending previous research on automatic identification of persuasion in text , we concentrate on generative aspects through conceptualizing determinants of persuasion in five business - focused categories : benevolence , linguistic appropriacy , logical argumentation , trustworthiness , tools & datasets . These allow NLG to increase an existing message’s persuasiveness . Previous research illustrates key aspects in each of the above mentioned five categories . A research agenda to further study persuasive NLG is developed . The review includes analysis of seventy - seven articles , outlining the existing body of knowledge and showing the steady progress in this research field . 1 . Introduction The movie ‘The Social Dilemma’ by Jeff Orlowski ( 2020 ) explores the rise of social media and the damage it has caused to society . With a rather negative connotation , the directors address the topic of digital platforms and how their users are influenced and persuaded in surveillance capitalism ( Economist 2019 ) . ​ Persuasion is an activity that involves one party , ​ the persuader ​ , trying to induce another party , ​ the persuadee ​ , to believe or disbelieve something or to do something ( Iyer & Sycara 2019 ) . The Economist ( 2019 ) claims that as a central tenet of surveillance capitalism , and persuasion is , furthermore , important in many aspects of daily life . Consider , for example , an employee demanding an increase in compensation , a physician trying to get a patient to enter a slimming programme , a charity volunteer trying to raise funds for a school project ( Hunter et al . 2019 ) , or a government advisor trying to get people to take a vaccination in the midst of a pandemic for the greater good . A persuasive Natural Language Generation ( NLG ) artificial intelligence ( AI ) is a system that can create communications aimed at a user ( the persuadee ) in order to persuade her to accept a specific argument through persuasive messages . he persuadee benefits from eating vegetables to improve their health but is also confronted with opposing arguments to erase misunderstandings in the persuader’s point of view . To do this , a persuasive NLG AI aims to use convincing arguments in order to persuade the persuadee . With recent advances in natural language processing and its subfield of natural language generation ( NLG ) , it was demonstrated that pretrained language models ( e . g . , GPT - 3 ) can achieve state - of - the - art results on a wide range of NLP tasks ( Economist 2020 ) . Such models allow for writing human - like texts through NLG , and can be fine - tuned for persuasion ​ . In the research of NLP and persuasion , Atalay et al . ( 2019 ) focus on syntax and persuasion , while Li et al . ( 2020 ) identify persuasion with NLP in online debates or in the news ( Yu et al . 2019 ) , and Rocklage et al . ( 2018 ) identify the relationship between psychological factors ( e . g . emotions ) and persuasion . In their seminal work , Iyer & Sycara ( 2019 , p . 4 ) confer that “working with [ subsequent uptake by the persuadee ] ” is an additional step . To explore this step , we conducted a structured literature review to identify whether the above research streams ( natural language processing & persuasion ) may fit in the following research question : What is the status quo of research focusing on persuasion and natural language generation ? 1 In this respect , a representative amount of research articles examined the concepts and technical intricacies behind persuasion in natural language processing and in psychological research . These aspects were classified and structured to develop a theory - based framework towards an overall understanding of persuasive NLG in a business context . Furthermore , we chose the format of a literature review for our paper , to indicate research gaps and survey an important part of larger research endeavors ( vom Brocke et al . 2009 ) . 2 . Method This paper’s methodology follows a framework proposed by vom Brocke et al . ( 2009 ) which is based on a screening of the review literature itself and especially highlights the need for comprehensively documenting the process of literature search in such an article ( Duerr et al . 2016 ) . The framework is structured into the following five steps : ( 1 ) definition of review scope , ( 2 ) conceptualization of topic , ( 3 ) literature search , ( 4 ) literature analysis and synthesis , and ( 5 ) research agenda . Each of the steps will be briefly explained , when it will be addressed in the course of this work . The first step is the definition of the review scope of this literature review . It is summarized in Figure 1 ( categories applicable to this review on Persuasion and NLG research are highlighted ) which is based on the taxonomy adapted by vom Brocke et al . ( 2009 ) . Figure 1 . Taxonomy of this literature review on the collaborative use of Persuasion ( following vom Brocke et al . 2009 ) This literature review ​ focuses on outcomes of applied research in the domains of Persuasion and Natural Language Generation . The ​ goal is to integrate findings with respect to five categories concluded from the business problem of persuading individuals through textual exchange ( DeMers 2016 ) . These categories were chosen as they address the psychological and technical aspects of persuasion and are a prerequisite to creating a persuasive NLG artificial intelligence . We selected this field because the artificial generation of persuasion through NLG has , as this literature review reveals , not been addressed in seminal articles following our structured research approach . Persuasion is already commonly studied in psychology ( Quirk et al . 1985 , Marwell & Schmitt 1967 ) . Also , numerous studies in natural language processing focus on identifying and classifying persuasion in an automated way ( Li et al . 2020 , Rocklage et al . 2018 , Iyer & Sycara 2019 , Yu et al . 2019 ) . This paper is ​ organized along a ​ conceptual structure . We did not take a particular ​ perspective to provide a neutral representation of the results . As an ​ audience of this review specialized scholars having an interest in the field of persuasion and the artificial generation of it were chosen . For ​ coverage , our literature review can be categorized as representative as our research has been limited to certain journals , but does not consider the totality of the literature . 2 Characteristic Categories Focus Research Outcome Research Method Theories Applications Goal Integration Criticism Central Issues Organization Historical Conceptual Methodological Perspective Neutral Representation Espousal of Position Audience Specialized Audience General Scholars Practitioners , Politicians General Public Coverage exhaustive exhaustive and selective representative central / pivotal The second step is ​ conceptualization of the topic ​ . It addresses the point that an author of a review article must begin with a topic in need of review , a broad conception of what is known about the topic , and potential areas where new knowledge may be needed . In the following , we conceptualize persuasion , and embed it into a business context . Furthermore , we introduce related theories , and conclude a categorization for the successive literature review . In persuasion , the ​ persuader induces a particular kind of mental state in the ​ persuadee ​ , e . g . , through threats , but unlike an expression of sentiment , persuasion intends a change in the mental state of the persuadee ( Iyer & Sycara 2019 ) . Contemporary psychology and communication science ( Rocklage et al . 2018 , Park et al . 2015 , Hunter et al . 2019 ) require the persuader to be acting intentionally , that is , the persuasive act . In the context of NLG , we usually refer to messages generated or augmented by an artificial intelligence , if we use the term persuasive act . In his seminal work ‘ ​ On Rhetoric ​ ’ , Aristotle introduced his well - known ontology for persuasive acts . Accordingly , persuasion depends on multiple facets : emotions ( ​ pathos ​ ) , logical structure of the argument ( ​ logos ​ ) , the context ( ​ cairos ​ ) , and on the speaker ( ​ ethos ​ ) ( Schiappa & Nordin 2013 ) . Likewise , contemporary business literature conceptualizes persuasive acts through “principles of persuasion” ( DeMers 2016 ) . The author concludes that six interventions help at achieving persuasiveness . The first is being confident and remaining confident during the entirety of an appeal . Next , the introduction of logical argumentation fosters persuasiveness , since individuals are more inclined to be persuaded by logic . Additionally , making an appeal seem beneficial to the other party , by demonstrating the value of an appeal , choosing words carefully ( i . e . , selecting from a vocabulary that may be more persuasive ) , and using flattery ( i . e . , finding appropriate compliments ) are recommended . Lastly , DeMers ( 2016 ) reveals that being patient and persistent ( i . e . , not to greatly alter one’s approach ) strengthens a persuader’s persuasiveness . Next , we embed the presented “principles of persuasion” into related theories on persuasion ( Cameron 2009 ) . Festinger’s Theory of Cognitive Dissonance ( 1957 ) focuses on the relationships among cognitive elements , which include beliefs , opinions , attitudes , or knowledge ( O’Keefe 1990 ) . This relates most to Aristotle’s ​ cairos ​ , and the need to create ​ benevolence for the persuadee . Evaluating the ‘business principles’ , this theory resonates best with what DeMers ( 2016 ) defines as ‘making [ the cognition ] appealing to the other party’ . However cognitions , and thus , a persuadee’s perceived benevolence , can be dissonant , consonant , or irrelevant to each other . If a persuadee is presented with a sufficiently vast cognitive inconsistency , then they will perceive psychological discomfort , leading to an attempt to restore their cognitive balance through a reduction or elimination of the inconsistency ( Stiff 1994 , Harmon - Jones 2002 ) . The magnitude of dissonance determines one’s motivation to reduce it ( Stiff 1994 , Festinger 1957 ) . Approaches towards reducing dissonance are : changing terms to make them more consonant , adding additional consonant percipience , or altering the magnitude of the percipience ( Harmon - Jones 2002 , Stiff 1994 , O’Keefe 1990 ) . In ‘principles of persuasion’ , DeMers ( 2016 ) contends that appropriate flattering and the usage of so - called high value words contribute to persuasive acts in business contexts ( cf . Aristotle’s ​ ethos ​ ) . Accordingly , Language Expectancy Theory ( LET ) identifies written or spoken language as a rule - based system through which persuadees develop expectations and preferences towards ​ ‘‘appropriate’’ linguistic usage of words in varying situations ( Burgoon & Miller 1985 ) . Such expectations are frequently consistent with sociological and cultural norms , while preferences tend to relate to societal standards and cultural values ( Burgoon & Miller 1985 , Burgoon et al . 2002 ) . Positive expectations that facilitate a persuasive act are , for instance , if a persuader stylizes a behavior that is perceived as more preferred than expected by the persuadee . In contrast , negative ones are inhibiting persuasion , e . g . , when the persuader makes use of language that is considered to be socially unacceptable ( Burgoon & Miller 1985 , Burgoon et al . 2002 ) . 3 Next , the ‘principles of persuasion’ confer that an argument based on logic is persuasive ( DeMers 2016 ) . What Aristotle terms ​ logos is consistent with the theory of probabilistic models . Probabilistic models ( McGuire 1981 , Wyer 1970 ) are based on the rules of formal logic and probability , and predict beliefs regarding the conclusion of reasoning . These predictions are based on mathematical probability , and as such this theory is consistent with what Aristotle defines as ​ logos ​ . An exemplary belief syllogism ( McGuire 1981 ) is composed of two premises that lead to a logical conclusion . The theorists ( McGuire 1981 , Wyer 1970 ) explain that believing in the premises leads to the expectation that the identified conclusion will follow . However , rather than solely thinking in all - or - nothing scenarios , beliefs can be ascertained through subjective probabilities : one’s judgment of the probability that each of the premises is true ( McGuire 1981 , Wyer 1970 ) . Furthermore , if a message evokes a perceptual change in the truth of the premise , or additional premises are supplemented , following this theory , a change in perceiving the conclusion is expected . Last , Balance Theory focuses on the triadic relationship involving two individuals ( e . g . , persuader and persuadee ) , the persuadee’s attitude toward the persuader ( Aristotle’s ​ pathos ​ ) , and their attitudes toward an attitudinal object ( Heider 1958 ) . The resulting triad can be balanced or unbalanced : This triad is in balance if all three relationships are positive , or one is positive and two are negative . If all three relationships are negative , or one is negative and two are positive , an unbalanced triad results , often motivating one to alter one of the three relationships ( Heider 1958 ) . Building on this theory , we aim to identify relational determinants that relate to improving the relationship between the persuader and the persuadee towards the attitudinal object ( Heider 1958 ) . In the business framework , we relate those determinants towards the pattern of ​ ‘trustworthiness’ , ​ that represent the persuadee’s attitude towards the persuader . In his persuasion attempt , the persuader wants the persuadee to have a positive attitude . Figure 2 . Conceptualization of ‘Business Principles’ Figure 2 summarizes our conceptualization , starting from the business problem of being more persuasive , we adopt the ‘principles of persuasion’ ( i . e . , benevolence , linguistic appropriacy , logical argumentation , and trustworthiness ) , and embed them into different scholarly theories ( i . e . , balance theory , probabilistic models , theory of cognitive dissonance , and language expectation theory ) . However , since we regard persuasion also from a technical perspective , ( i . e . , natural language generation ) , we also identify relevant data processing tools & datasets for persuasive natural language generation . In the following , we introduce our literature search process . Afterwards , we use these principles from managerial literature to categorize our identified aspects from our conducted literature review . 4 ( 3 ) The literature search considered the sources presented in Table 1 We searched on the journal quality evaluation web service ‘simagojr . com’ for the subjects ‘psychology’ and the subject category ‘experimental and cognitive psychology’ ​ 1 ​ , respectively for the subject ‘computer science’ and the subject category ‘artificial intelligence’ ​ 2 in December , 2020 , to retrieve the most renowned journals in their respective research subject . We filtered the results for ‘NAFTA’ , ‘JOURNAL’ , and ‘DECREASING SJR’ . From the resulting list , the top 10 research journals in their domain were selected ( see Table 1 , Column 1 ) . The relevant search terms used in the domains were : “Natural Language Processing ( NLP ) ” , “Natural Language Generation ( NLG ) ” , “Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) ” , “Persuasion” , “Convincing” , and “Negotiation” . These evolved from readings related to our topic . We arrived at Table 1 by using the search string : ‘ ​ source : " < JOUNRAL NAME > " ( nlp OR nlg OR artificial intelligence ) AND ( persuasion OR persuade OR negotiation OR convincing ) ‘ ​ on Google Scholar for each respective Journal . Table 1 : Searched Journals on December 26 , 2020 Next , the choice of whether a retrieved article will be studied in detail in this literature review was made based on the abstract . After reading the identified articles and verifying their thematic consistency with the objective , the citations used in each article were analyzed to search for articles that have not been identified in the initial search process ( Table 1 ) . 1 Journal of Experimental Child Psychology was deemed irrelevant and therefore not searched . 2 Science Robotics , Int . Journal of Robotics Research was deemed irrelevant and therefore not searched . 5 Journal Domain Search Field Coverage Hits Relevant Multivariate Behavioral Research Psychology Abstract 2000 - 2020 2 0 Journal of Memory and Language Psychology Abstract 2000 - 2020 5 2 Developmental Review Psychology Abstract 2000 - 2020 11 0 Cognitive Psychology Psychology Abstract 2000 - 2020 94 6 Journal of Experimental Psychology : General Psychology Abstract 2000 - 2020 33 0 Behavior Research Methods Psychology Abstract 2000 - 2020 23 3 Psychonomic Bulletin and Review Psychology Abstract 2000 - 2020 1 0 Journal of Experimental Psychology : Learning Memory and Cognition Psychology Abstract 2000 - 2020 31 1 Journal of Experimental Psychology : Human Perception and Performance Psychology Abstract 2000 - 2020 26 3 Cognitive Science Psychology Abstract 2000 - 2020 57 2 IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence Computer Science Abstract 2000 - 2020 93 1 Foundations and Trends in Machine Learning Computer Science Abstract 2000 - 2020 0 0 IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems Computer Science Abstract 2000 - 2020 52 1 IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems Computer Science Abstract 2000 - 2020 55 2 Journal of Memory and Language Computer Science Abstract 2000 - 2020 9 1 Journal of Machine Learning Research Computer Science Abstract 2000 - 2020 18 0 Journal of the ACM Computer Science Abstract 2000 - 2020 5 0 International Journal of Intelligent Systems Computer Science Abstract 2000 - 2020 74 4 IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking Computer Science Abstract 2000 - 2020 4 0 Knowledge - Based Systems Computer Science Abstract 2000 - 2020 251 3 Finally , Web of Science and Google Scholar are used to deploy forward and backward search ( Webster & Watson 2002 ) for articles citing the identified article , and again it is analyzed whether these are consistent with the objective and have not been identified in the initial process ( Duerr et al . 2016 ) . This process served for enlarging the quantity of the main sources and unveiled another 48 relevant articles from journals , conferences , and magazines . The two last steps of von Brocke et al . ( 2009 ) ’s framework for literature reviewing are ( 4 ) literature analysis and synthesis for classifying the identified articles as well as developing a ( 5 ) research agenda are explained thoroughly in the following sections , as these are the main outcomes of our work . 3 . Results The following paragraph shows the results of previous research ( literature analysis and synthesis ) and therefore is the next step ( 4 ) of the vom Brocke et al . ( 2009 ) literature review framework . Here , we focus on the four identified categories of persuasive natural language generation that underlie the business framework introduced in step ( 2 ) conceptualization . We ordered the identified categories alphabetically , hence , we do not imply a differentiation in degrees of persuasiveness . Additionally , we provide relevant tools and datasets required for implementation of a persuasive NLG . Benevolence Determinants that aim at creating value for the persuadee are subsumed in this category ( DeMers 2016 , Voss & Raz 2016 ) . In line with Cognitive Dissonance Theory ( Festinger 1957 ) the identified eight determinants relate to altering a persuadee’s perceived benevolence through dissonant or consonant measures ( summarized in Table 3 ) . An implementation in a persuasive NLG AI can be facilitated through identifying their absence or impact ( Hunter et al 2019 , Zarouali et al . 2020 ) . The benevolence determinants are ordered alphabetically to not imply a specific order . The first column presents the determinants , the second column concisely defines each , and the third provides examples for all determinants that were identified . The last column states the corresponding citations . Table 3 : Benevolence Determinants 6 Determinant Synopsis Example Source Exemplifications The process or act of giving examples . Words such as : for instance , namely . Quirk et al . 1985 , Brewer 1980 Appealing to Morality Mentions of good or bad morality of a persuasive act . A judge would sentence you since it is not okay to steal . Marwell & Schmitt 1967 , Luttrell et al . 2019 Non - Monetary Terms Offering of additional items that may be important to the persuadee but not to the persuader . We do have an old reliable Toyota . We could just add this to the 5k . What do you think ? Ames & Wazlavek 2014 None - Acceptable Terms Understanding the persuadee ' s wants and thereby eliminating what is not . Persuadee : ‘This number is too low for me because I want to buy a car with it . ’ Camp 2002 Outcome Mentioning of particular consequences from eventual actions . I want you to put the gun down because I don’t want to see you get hurt . Douven & Mirabile 2018 , Marwell & Schmitt 1967 Regulatory Fit Occurs when a message matches the persuadee’s motivational orientation by focusing either on promoting gains or avoiding losses . Example for a gain : ‘This makes healthy teeth ! ’ , and a loss : ‘This avoids cavities ! ” Hirsh et al . 2012 , Higgins 2000 Scarcity Mentioning of rarity , urgency , or opportunity for some outcome . I tell you a little secret okay ? They’re pushing me to get something done and I am trying to hold them . Cialdini & Goldstein 2002 Social Proof Reference to what is customary in a given situation . Suppose your new car can be seen by all of your neighbors . Cialdini & Goldstein 2002 Linguistic Appropriacy This category subsumes fourteen determinants that facilitate an individual’s stylome and aim at matching this with linguistic appropriacy . Such a stylome can be quantified and identified linguistically ( Zarouali et al . 2020 ) . Aforementioned ​ Language Expectation Theory identifies written or spoken language as a rule - based system through which persuadees develop expectations ( Burgoon & Miller 1985 ) . ​ The reason for profiling the stylome of an individual is to match these expectations ( Park et al . 2015 ) . Once implemented , a persuasive NLG AI can achieve congruence between a persuasive message and the persuadee , and thus generate persuasiveness . Table 2 introduces fourteen determinants of linguistic appropriacy in alphabetical order , provides a synopsis ( i . e . , brief summary , column two ) , an example for each determinant ( column three ) , and the corresponding academic citation ( in column four ) . Table 2 : Linguistic Appropriacy Determinants 7 Determinant Synopsis Example Source Amplifiers These increase intensity , show precision or express certainty . Words such as : extremely . Quirk et al . 1985 Connectivity Degree to which a text contains explicit comparative connectives to express connections in it . as . . . as , more than . . . , than . . . Crossley et al . 2008 Downtoners Reduce the strength of an expression or voice doubt . Words such as : slightly , somewhat , almost . Quirk et al . 1985 Emphatics Pronouns such as myself , yourself , herself , and himself . Words such as : myself . Quirk et al . 1985 , Brewer 1980 Evidence Words Tendency to approve or disapprove something . Words such as : according to . Quirk et al . 1985 Familiarity Degree of familiarity of a word or how easily a word can be recognized by an adult . Table , sun , and dog are more familiar than cortex or dogma . Coltheart 1981 , Hung & Gonzales 2013 Hypernymy Specificity or abstractness of a word . Machine is a hypernym of a car . Fellbaum 1998 Imagability Meaningful terms have a higher degree of meaning due to a semantic association with other words . Words that are very imagery are bride or hammer , whereas quantum or dogmar are less . Coltheart 1981 , Nazari et al . 2019 Indefinite Pronouns Indefinite pronouns do not refer to a specific thing or person . Words such as : all , non , some .

Possible overlaps between sentences : noun , argument , stem , and content word . Kintsch & Van Dijk 1978 Meaningfulness Refers to the total number of varying words in a written text . Words such as people are semantically related to many more compared to a noun such as abbess . Wilson 1988 , Jia 2009 Open Ended Questions Removal of aggression from a persuasive act that allows to introduce arguments without sounding dominant . What else can I help you with ? Sinaceur & Tiedens 2006 Temporal Cohesion Consequent usage of one temporal tense ( e . g . , past or present ) . He goes to school . Then , he goes home . ( both are in presence ) McNamara et al . 2013 Word Frequency Indication of how often used words occur in a given language . More uncommon words reflect that the writer possesses larger vocabulary . Baayen et al . 1995 Logical Argumentation Previous academic works unveil that arguments with consistent logic in persuasive acts increase persuasiveness ( Cialdini & Goldstein 2002 , Walton et al . 2008 , Block et al . 2019 ) . In line with ​ the theory of Probabilistic Models ( McGuire 1981 , Wyer 1970 ) , it is assumed that conclusive statements lead to a persuadee’s expectation that a conclusion will follow . Technical implementations of logical argumentation or logical meaning representations occur as first order logic or semantic argumentation graphs ( Moens 2018 , Block et al . 2019 ) . The first column of Table 4 enumerates our fourteen logical argumentation determinants , while the second provides a synopsis . Column three provides an example , and column four the corresponding citation in which the factor was identified . As in previous tables , the determinants are merely sorted alphabetically . Table 4 : Logical Argumentation Determinants Trustworthiness Trust plays an important role in the persuader - persuadee relationship . If established , the persuadee’s attitude toward the persuader - as identified in Balance Theory ( Heider 1958 ) - helps a persuadee to reason about the reciprocative nature , honesty or reliability of the counterpart ( Kim & Duhachek 2020 ) . An implementation of trustworthiness can , amongst others , ​ be realized through identifying a persuadee’s psychological profile ( e . g . , extroverted individuals respond better to texts that have a positive valence , and are in that case more persuadable , Zarouali et al . 2020 , Park et al . 2015 ) to influence the degree of persuasiveness of a persuasive act . This category collates fifteen determinants pertaining to the increase 8 Determinant Synopsis Example Source Analogy Reframes issues through the usage of analogy or metaphor .

Fellbaum 1998 or decrease of trustworthiness ( column one , sorted alphabetically ) . The following columns provide a synopsis ( column two ) , a corresponding example ( column three ) and the source in which the determinant was identified ( column four ) . Table 5 : Trustworthiness Determinants Tools & Datasets In the analyzed academic studies , we found that the authors use different datasets and tools to computationally process data for technical analyses of persuasion in NLP or NLG ( e . g . , in Guerini et al 2008a / b , Li et al . 2020 , Iyer / Sycara 2019 ) . Logically , the implementation of a persuasive NLG AI also depends on a variety of relevant tools and datasets which we identified and consolidated in Table 6 . This table classifies our findings in types which are either tool or datasets ( column one ) . We identified six tools and seventeen persuasion or message datasets . A software tool that is used in the context of persuasion and NLP , and datasets were chosen if they were used in the context of persuasion , textual exchange / debate and NLP . We further added a synopsis ( column three ) explaining every tool and 9 Determinant Synopsis Example Source Agreeableness If a persuadee says “That’s right , ” it indicates that he / she feels understood .

Discussion This section displays the last step of the framework for literature reviewing ( Vom Brocke et al . 2009 ) : ( 5 ) Developing a research agenda . For our proposed agenda for future research in the field of persuasive NLG ( Figure 2 ) , we conclude that an unambiguous and concise comprehension of how the forty - nine identified determinants influence the generation of persuasive artificially generated messages ( i . e . , the persuasive act ) is needed . Furthermore , twenty - one tools & datasets were identified that allow one to train generative deep neural nets within the scope of persuasive NLG artificial intelligence . Next , we conclude our research proposals . Figure 3 . Proposed research agenda for future research on persuasive NLG Our framework encompasses four identified categories ( based on the ‘principles of persuasion’ ​ and embedded into academic theories , i . e . Cognitive Dissonance , Language Expectancy , Probabilistic Models , and Balance Theory ) as prerequisites for persuasive NLG that have not been comprehensively considered in the journals considered for this review before . For evaluating our approach the research proposal ( RP1 ) : ​ ‘ ​ How should successful persuasiveness in Natural Language Generation be theorized ? ​ ’ has to be answered first in order to use this instrument as a remainder ​ of further identified research proposals . Consequently , this framework can be used to investigate different ​ successful approaches to generate persuasive messages through a persuasive NLG artificial intelligence . Future research should investigate the empirical implementation of ​ benevolence for the persuadee ​ . In such regard , a given example in the circumstance of hostage negotiation ( Gilbert 2010 ) may be transferable to business situations ( cf . Table 3 , Outcome : I want you to put the gun down because I don’t want to see you get hurt ​ ) . This example shows that the persuadee can expect benevolence as an outcome , if he acts in a certain way . Combining the identified determinants , a ​ thorough linguistic analysis of ​ appropriate language for the persuadee can be derived . ​ As an example , meaningfulness is a crucial linguistic concept in persuasion ( Atalay et al . 2019 , Graesser et al . 2011 ; cf . Table 2 ) , but lexical overlap even more directly influences persuasiveness , since it provides a consistency towards the persuadee’s 11 language expectancy ( Heider 1958 ) . A consistent argumentative logic implementable with determinants such as connectives , hedges , or logical operators , allows coherently concatenating a variety of arguments as well as the creation of an argumentative narrative . Logic can provide a blueprint for writing , or an approach to effectively organize a persuasive act ( Habernal & Gurevych 2016 ) . ​ A high ​ trust - level of a persuader would mean that s / he is likely to be chosen as an interaction partner ( Axelrod 1984 ) . To the research community we propose a framework with persuasive determinants that are particularly pronounced in a persuasive act , which is also contingent on environmental aspects . Investigating these mechanisms ( Table 3 - 6 ) would potentially provide insights regarding our research proposal ( RP2 ) : ‘How should the determinants within the categories ‘language appropriacy , trustworthiness , benevolence , and logical argumentation’ be implemented and integrated to contribute to increased persuasiveness through persuasive Natural Language Generation ? ’ A variety of different tools and datasets prepare the input for deep learning models that underpin artificial intelligence and their training for text generation . Such models are inherently complex , so it is crucial to experiment , carefully prepare different datasets , and use the identified tools strategically to make the persuadee ​ act ​ upon the persuasive ​ act ​ ( Anand et al . 2011 ) . In this light , we propose RP 3 : ‘Which tools & which datasets are most contributive for deep learning training to increase persuasiveness in persuasive Natural Language Generation ? ’ Ultimately , the persuader will need to complement the persuasive measures that a persuasive NLG AI can suggest - due to possible deficiencies of crucial information that computational systems may inherently lack ( e . g . , aspects not explicitly outlined in textual data ) . Therefore , a persuasive NLG may be limited to serve as an assistant proposing suitable techniques or recommending alterations to linguistic measures in specific situations . Still , the persuader will be the one to edit and submit any artificially generated persuasive message to a persuadee , and is therefore ​ fully responsible ​ . Yet , such artificial intelligence can be used to help people to persuade them to do good things ( like losing weight ; Hunter et al . 2019 ) . 5 . Conclusion This literature review synthesized the existing research on persuasive NLG in four categories for a persuasive NLG artificial intelligence by considering seventy - seven sources and integrating their results in forty - nine determinants . We concluded our identified categories and determinants ( cf . Table 7 ) by addressing our previously introduced research question ‘ ​ What is the status quo of research focusing on persuasion and natural language generation ? ​ ’ Table 7 : Overview Findings of Literature Review Our findings provide an overview of the existing body of knowledge and propose a research agenda that unites and encompasses previous efforts . Previous research regarding persuasion and NLP has moved 12 Category Determinants # Benevolence Exemplifications , Appealing to Morality , Non - Monetary Terms , None - Acceptable Terms , Outcome , Regulatory Fit , Scarcity , and Social Proof . 8 Linguistic Appropriacy Amplifiers , Connectivity , Downtoners , Emphatics , Evidence Words , Familiarity , Hypernymy , Imagability , Indefinite Pronouns , Lexical Overlap , Meaningfulness , Open Ended Questions , Temporal Cohesion , and Word Frequency . 14 Logical Argumentation Analogy , Causal Cohesion , Connectives , Consistency , Establishing Ranges , Favors / Debts , Good / Bad Traits , Hedges , Logical Operators , Odd Numbers , Reason , and Spatial Cohesion . 12 Trustworthiness Agreeableness , Authority , Seeking Comprehension , Construal , Emotionality , Empathy , Labeling of Issues , Message - Person Congruence , Personal Congruence , Politeness Marks , Repetition , Threat / Promise , User Beliefs , User Concerns , and Valence . 15 on from a strong persuasion identification focus , which supports our framework for generation . Identified articles were consistent but lacked sophisticated integration , therefore we see them in a rather fragmented stage . Additionally , we identified technical resources ( tools & datasets ) critical to AI success . This literature review regarding persuasive NLG research faces some limitations itself . First , this literature review mainly covers the years 2000 - 2020 . Undeniably , additional articles were published before , and in the meantime , which should be included in a future version . Secondly , this review concentrated only on a selection of top journals , but as we were not fully satisfied with our results we were using backward and forward search ( Webster & Watson 2002 ) , which may lead to less sophisticated sources . Moreover , it cannot be guaranteed that the framework will succeed or that it is complete . The presented approach identifies a vast amount of relevant aspects and should be used as a starting point for actions and for further research . Therefore , it needs to be emphasized that no individual determinant suffices on its own . Rather multiple interactions in a given context will ensure a ‘ ​ persuadee to be persuaded’ by a persuasive NLG that is built on the findings of this literature review . Unfortunately , some variables that influence a generated persuasive response cannot be deduced from text processing alone ( e . g . current mental state , well - being , or the environment in which the persuadee receives the response ) , but should also be taken into consideration for persuasive acts ( Hunter et al . 2019 ) . In general , we do not see a ‘one size fits all’ approach ( Duerr et al . 2016 ) . Some linguistic determinants or persuasion techniques may work better than others in certain settings , but different in others . Pulse checks , data inputs , and reiterating the model , data and tools in the AI continuously , to learn from behaviors , attitudes , circumstances and usage will help . However , the identified articles , the detailed and transparent documentation of the literature search process , the proposed categorization of the aspects in each of the research fields , and the proposed research agenda can serve as a good starting point for further literature reviews and future research in the persuasive NLG research field . To conclude , this paper has acknowledged that persuasive NLG builds on psychological , linguistic , and technical concepts . Despite the advantages of automated persuasion as presented in our introduction ( e . g . , entering a slimming programme , raising funds , taking vaccinations ) with the help of AI , there is concern as to how such technologies can be misappropriated ( cf . ‘The Social Dilemma’ ) . Ultimately , it is the academic community combined with advances of technological capabilities that will improve persuasion for good and release its great potential . Our research agenda suggests combining the right determinants in specific contexts and the usage of tools for training deep neural networks with relevant datasets . Thus , we have proposed a research direction to use the power of AI in this promising field for social good . References 13 Abdallah , S . , D ' souza , S . , Gal , Y .
