Supplementary Information WHAMM initiates autolysosome tubulation by promoting actin polymerization on autolysosomes Dai et al . Supplementary Figures Supplementary Figure 1 Generation of the WHAMM - KO NRK cell line by CRISPR - Cas9 mediated gene knockout . ( a ) The guide RNA and PAM sequence are highlighted . DNA sequencing results are shown from a single colony , with the same modification successfully introduced into both alleles .

A total of 103 ( WT ) , 120 ( KO ) 81 ( 1 - 630 ) and 88 ( W807A ) cells were analyzed in n = 3 independent experiments . 125 ( FL ) cells was analyzed in n = 4 independent experiments . Error bars indicate SEM . One - way ANOVA followed with Holm - Sidak’s multiple comparisons test . Compared with KO : * * * , p < 0 . 001 ; ns , not significant . Compared with WT : # # # # , p < 0 . 0001 , # , p < 0 . 05 . ( c ) Cells in ( a ) were further starved to 12 hours and observed using confocal microscopy . Enlarged autolysosomes can be seen in mutant rescue cells ( scale bar , main micrograph 5 μm ; upper panel 2 μm ) .

Error bars indicate SD . ( e ) Cells treated with CK666 were further starved to 12 hours . Accumulation of large autolysosome can be observed in drug - treated cells ( scale bar , main micrograph 5 μm ; upper panel 2 μm ) . ( f ) The size of autolysosomes from cells in ( e ) was measured . n = 799 ( WT ) , 750 ( DMSO ) and 1074 ( CK666 ) autolysosomes . Error bars indicate SD . One - way ANOVA followed with Holm - Sidak’s multiple comparisons test . * * * * , p < 0 . 0001 ; ns , not significant . Source data are provided as a Source Data file . Supplementary Figure 3 Recovery of tubulation events after CK666 wash - out . Scale bar , 5 μm . LAMP1 - mCherry was pseudo - colored to yellow . Supplementary Figure 4 WHAMM’s NPF activity is required for F - actin formation on autolysosomes . ( a ) WT NRK cells stably expressing mCherry - WHAMM were transfected with GFP - LifeAct . 18 hours post - transfection , cells were starved for 4 hours , then fixed and stained with antibody against LAMP1 . Arrowheads indicate co - localized WHAMM and LifeAct on an autolysosome ( scale bar , main figure 5 μm ; upper right panel 2 μm ) . ( b ) WHAMM - KO cells were transfected with GFP - LifeAct and constructs containing WHAMM - FL or different NPF - defective mutants . 18 hours post - transfection , cells were starved for 8 hours and fixed and stained with antibody against LAMP1 ( scale bar , main figure 5 μm ; upper right panel 2 μm ) . Supplementary Figure 5 WHAMM binds to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 through two conserved amphipathic helices . ( a ) Sequence alignment of the regions contain the two amphipathic helices . The helices are underlined in red . Sites changed by mutagenesis in this work are indicated with an arrow and highlighted in yellow . Supplementary Figure 6 WHAMM’s interaction with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is required for ALR . ( a ) FL WHAMM with single mutations ( L201K , A321D ) or another double mutation ( L190D - A321D ) were transfected into WHAMM - KO cells stably expressing LAMP1 - YFP . 18 hours post - transfection , cells were starved for 8 hours and observed using confocal microscopy ( scale bar , main micrograph 5 μm , upper panel 2 μm ) . ( b ) Cells in ( a ) were quantified for tubular autolysosomes . A total of 103 ( WT ) , 120 ( KO ) and 105 ( FL ) cells were examined in n = 3 independent experiments . 84 ( L201K ) , 78 ( A321D ) and 103 ( L190D - A321D ) cells were examined in n = 2 independent experiments .
