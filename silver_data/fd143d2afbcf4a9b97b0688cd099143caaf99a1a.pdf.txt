The Evolution of Mental Metaphors in Psychology : A 90 - Year Retrospective Dedre Gentner Jonathan Grudin ABSTRACT It seems plausible that the conception of the mind has evolved over the first hundred years of psychology in America . In this research , we studied this evolution by tracing changes in the kinds of metaphors used by psychologists to describe mental phenomena . A corpus of metaphors from 1894 to the present was collected and examined . The corpus consisted of all metaphors for mental phenomena used in the first issue of Psychological Review in each decade , beginning with the inception of the journal in 1894 and continuing with 1905 , 1915 , and so on through 1975 . These nine issues yielded 265 mental metaphors , which were categorized ac - cording to the type of analogical domain from which the comparison was drawn . The chief finding was that the nature of the mental metaphors . changed over time . Spatial meta - phors and animate - being metaphors predominated in the early stages , then declined in favor of systems metaphors , often taken from mathematics and the physical sciences . A secondary finding was that the numbers of mental metaphors varied . Metaphors for mental phenomena were more prevalent in the early and late stages of the corpus than in the middle stages ( 1935 to 1955 ) . These patterns are interpreted in terms of conceptual evolution in psychologists ' models of the mind . In this article we examine historical changes in the metaphors used by American psychologists to de - scribe mental processes . Our aim is to use changes in metaphoric language to trace changes in the models of the mind that psychologists have held . It is by now accepted that researchers bring to their field of study a theoretical framework - which may be more or less explicitly conscious - in terms of which they construe the phenomena they observe ( Koestler , 1964 ) . Moreover , these frameworks change over history , sometimes quite rapidly ( Kuhn , 1962 ) . Cognitive psychology during the past hundred years seems a prime example of a field in which conceptual change has been rapid and extensive .

Cambridge , Massachusetts MRC Applied Psychology Unit Cambridge , England the - century dialectic between structuralism and . functionalism was followed by the schools of Gestalt psychology , behaviorism , and still later by informa - tion processing . Some of these changes are recorded in major position papers or books , such as Titchener ' s ( 1915 ) primer . Yet such position statements are not always available , and when we do find them they may constitute later codifications of principles rather than reflections of the actual development of the ideas . It would be useful to have a more immediate method for tracing changes in the zeitgeist . The kinds of metaphoric language used in articles through . this period of history in psychology may provide just such a measure . To infer underlying models from the metaphors used in writing about psychology requires making the assumption that metaphorical language reflects underlying metaphoric thought , that is , that it reflects a genuine mapping of significant relationships from the analogical domain to the target domain ( the domain to be explained ; e . g . , Lakoff & Johnson , 1980 ; Reddy , 1979 ) . Certainly some caution is war - ranted here . The mere existence of metaphorical language cannot be taken to indicate an underlying conceptual model corresponding to the metaphor . Nevertheless , studies of the history of science have produced persuasive evidence that scientists use metaphor in the invention and organization of ideas ( e . g . , Darden , 1980 ; Hesse , 1966 ; Hoffman , 1980 ; , Hofstaedter , 1981 ; Koestler , 1964 ) . More importantly , the firsthand introspective reports of working scien - tists also stress the importance of metaphor in their creative thinking ( e . g . , Glashow , 1980 ; Kepler , 1620 / 1969 ; Oppenheimer , 1956 ) . Further ; there are exper - imental demonstrations that the inferences people draw in problem - solving tasks are affected by the analogies they bring to the domain ( Gentner & Gentner , 1983 ; Gick & Holyoak , 1980 ) . More specifically , it has been argued persuasively that metaphors from other domains have played a role in the shaping of psychological theory . Roediger ( 1979 , 1980 ) noted several distinct metaphors for human memory , such as Freud ' s ( 1952 ) house model 181 and Atkinson and Shiffrin ' s ( 1968 ) storage box model . He argued that commonalities among these metaphoric , models can reveal deep - seated intuitions of the research community . Hearst ( 1979 ) suggested that the structuralist effort to isolate and characterize the " basic elements of the mind " was put together by Titchener using the analogy of chemistry . As a related point , Zwicky ( 1973 ) traced the widespread use of a similar molecular combination metaphor in linguistics . If indeed the metaphors used in psychology reflect the way that researchers have conceived of the domain , then changes in the kinds of metaphors used to describe the mind may provide an unobtru - sive measure of changes in the conceptual paradigms used in American psychology . With this in mind , we undertook to collect a representative sample of metaphors of the mind . We chose as our source the journal Psychological Review , because it has a history of broad representation of major work in psychology that dates back to 1894 . Thus , our project was designed ( a ) to sample Psychological Review system - atically from 1894 to the present for mental meta - phors , ( b ) to classify the resulting metaphors accord - ing to their base domain ( their analogical domain or domain of origin ) , and ( c ) to note any changes in the numbers or types of metaphors used across time . Methods Used Corpus For each decade since the inception of the journal , we examined all articles in the first issue of one volume . The years selected were 1894 ( Vol . 1 ) , 1905 ( Vol . 12 ) , 1915 ( Vol . 22 ) , 1925 ( Vol . 32 ) , 1935 ( Vol . 42 ) , 1945 ( Vol . 52 ) , 1955 ( Vol . 62 ) , 1965 ( Vol . 72 ) , and 1975 ( Vol . 82 ) . Although each article was ex - amined , not all of them yielded metaphors for the mind . Out of a total of 68 articles , 48 contained metaphors of relevance to this study . The articles containing mental metaphors were numbered and appear in Table 1 , along with the number of mental metaphors found in each . Method of Seketion All mental metaphors were recorded on their first occurrence in a given article . A mental metaphor was defined as a nonliteral comparison in which either the mind as a whole or some particular aspect of the mind ( ideas , processes , etc . ) is likened to or explained in terms of a nonliteral domain . ' Preferring to err on the side of inclusiveness , we included in the initial collection everything that seemed a possible metaphor , including many frozen or conventionalized metaphors , such as " mental health " or " intellectual level " Only one instance of each metaphoric term 182 or phrase was collected from a given article . Thus the count of metaphors represents the number of types , not the number of tokens in each article . This was done to avoid extraneous effects of article length . However , when more than one . term or phrase occurred in connection with a particular extended metaphor , all of the terms were collected . An example of such a system occurs in James ( 1905 ) : The phrases " an idea encountering a rin g idea , " " an idea moving under its own momentum , " and " ideas overcoming an obstacle " ( pp . 6 , 7 ) were each recorded , although they are clearly part of the same extended metaphor . Method of Categorization After the set of metaphors was assembled , we sorted them into groups of three or more that seemed drawn from a common domain . Most of these groupings cut across decades , because the sorting was guided by the content of the metaphors them - selves rather than by decade of origin . The next phase was to combine these small groups into mean - ingful larger categories . We arrived at four major content categories , further described in the Results section . The final product of the selection and categorization is a list of metaphors used in each decade , categorized according to the analogical do - main from which each metaphor is drawn . Where more than one category or subcategory might apply , we used the central features of the metaphor to select among alternatives . If two cate - gories seemed equally applicable , we assigned the metaphor to the most specific of them . This issue arises particularly with the spatial category ( see below ) , because many metaphors assigned to other categories involve spatial information ( Roediger , 1979 , 1980 ) . Thus , metaphors like " a find - and - compare operation " or " control structures " ( Car - penter & Just , 1975 ) were categorized as computer systems metaphors rather than as spatial metaphors , The study on which this article is based was done for a seminar headed by George Mandler at the University of California at San Diego .

In general , if the focus of a metaphor was on a lawfully constrained interaction of a set of elements , the metaphor was classified as a systems metaphor . If the focus was on particular spatial interactions of objects or simply on their distribution in . space , the metaphor was classified as a spatial metaphor . Results Categories ofMetaphors We found a total of 265 metaphors for mental phenomena . The initial sorting into groups yielded 20 groups of 3 or more metaphors , which combined into four major categories of metaphor : animate - being metaphors ( 23 instances ) , neural metaphors ( 16 instances ) , spatial metaphors ( 61 instances ) , and systems metaphors ( 80 instances ) . In animate - being metaphors , ideas or aspects of the mind are likened to creatures . These are sometimes reminiscent of homunculi , as in " my ideas may have no prevision of the whole of [ my plan ] " ( James , 1905 , p . 11 ) ; but in other cases they are clearly nonhuman crea - tures , as in " through lying , the mind grows wary or strong from swimming against the stream " ( Dewey , 1894 , p . 109 ) . In neural metaphors , the analogical domain is some version of the physical nervous system , as when a disturbance of thought is likened to " shortcircuiting too large an amount of excitation " ( Arnold , 1945 , p . 47 ) , or more elaborately , when it is stated that word meanings are stored as mental images acquired through different senses , located in different regions of the gray cortex of the brain , and joined together in a unit by a series of association - tracts which pass in the white matter under the cortex . ( Starr , 1894 , p . 89 ) 184 Spatial metaphors have as their analogical domain the distribution or movement of objects in space , as in thoughts " on or below the sensory surface " ( Woodworth , 1915 , p . 15 ) or " things active against a background of consciousness " ( Strong , 1894 , p . 79 ) . Systems metaphors are those that liken some mental phenomenon to a system of lawfully con - strained interactions among elements . Often they draw on a physical or mathematical system2 or on an artificial device as their analogical domain : for example , " fusion of ideas " ( Peterson , 1935 ) , " the variance of the distribution of associative strength " ( Bahrick , 1965 , p . 61 ) , or critical band behaving . " like a variable band - pass filter " ( Zwicker & Scharf , 1965 , p . 24 ) . Instances from each of these categories are given in Table 2 for early , middle , and recent periods . In addition to the four major categories de - scribed , there were two other categories . The first was a conventional category for terms that seem to have some metaphoric basis but whose metaphoric associations may have been lost . Examples of items in this category are " mental health , " " intellectual growth , " and " mental state . " Of the 265 total met - aphors , 71 were classified as conventional metaphors . 2 Although some would argue that the use of mathematical systems is not actually metaphoric , we have included such usage as one subcategory of systems metaphors . This is chiefly because , as the use of the term mathematical model itself suggests , equations and variables have the essential characteristics of ana - logical representations ; that is , they convey that the relational structure of the target domain is much like that of an analogical domain ( in this case , a mathematical system ) , which is otherwise quite different from the target domain . Furthermore , as is described below , the pattern of distribution of mathematical models is similar to that of other systems metaphors . In any case , the exclusion of this subcategory would not change the overall pattern of distribution among the four major categories .

This category was included to allow for metaphors that resisted categorization ; 14 metaphors were placed in this group . An example of an idio - syncratic metaphor is the comparison of cognition to respiration , in that each has a typical , dominant form plus variations ( Heidbreder , 1945 ; it should be noted that Heidbreder commented on the limits of the analogy ) . Patterns of Distribution The patterns of metaphor use change across time in two distinct ways . The most important finding is that there was a change in the kinds of mental metaphors used from the beginning of the survey to the end . This shift is discussed in detail below . A second chronological pattern is that the overall num - ber of metaphors used shows a U - shaped distribution , with a decline in the middle tridecade relative to February 1985 • American Psychologist Neural Associations among images , like Thinking is neural impulses shifting white matter connecting regions of along associative fibers from one gray matter ( Starr , 1894 ) area to another ( Dashiell , 1925 ) Wider ideas shortcircuit smaller Anger shortcircuits excitation into ideas ( James , 1905 ) the parasympathetic system ( Arnold , 1945 ) Spatial Habitual connections between ideas ( Peterson , 1935 ) Tracing is to a photograph as Fear inundates the sympathetic memory is to immediate attention nervous system ( Arnold , 1945 ) ( Woodworth , 1915 ) Systems A body moves in empty space by Nervous system is like a its own momentum as when our switchboard mechanism thoughts wander at their own ( Gray , 1935 ) sweet will ( James , 1905 ) Goal gradient : positive / negative Associative force transfer ( Dennis , 1935 ) ( Woodworth , 1915 ) Recent ( 1955 - 1975 ) Super discriminating preperceiver who selectively prevents recognition ( Minard , 1965 ) Ego defenses ( Minard , 1965 ) Inhibitory processes ( Zwicker & Scharf , 1965 ) Loudness perhaps proportionate to number of mental impulses ( Zwicker & Scharf , 1965 ) Critical band is formed ( Zwicker & Scharf , 1965 ) Reservoir model for fixed action pattern ( Moltz , 1965 ) B = r / r + i , where r = no . of relevant elements , i = no . of irrelevant elements , and B = conditioning constant ( Restle , 1955 ) Serial iterative operations ( Carpenter & Just , 1975 ) the first and last tridecades of the survey . The mean numbers of mental metaphors used per issue are 31 . 0 in the first tridecade ( 1894 to 1915 ) , 21 . 0 in the middle tridecade ( 1925 to 1945 ) , and 36 . 3 in the last tridecade ( 1955 to 1975 ) . This variation in overall number of metaphors is significant by a chi - square test , X2 ( 2 , N = 265 ) = 12 . 35 , p < . 01 . Analyses As noted above , the major finding is a shift in the categories of metaphoric domains used over time . To verify this shift , we examined the data in three different ways . In the first analysis , we compared the number of metaphors used in each of the four major cate - gories in each of the three tridecade blocks , as shown in Figure 1 . In the early samples , spatial metaphors and animate - being metaphors dominate . There is a sharp 185 Figure 1 Numbers of . Metaphors in Each Tridecade for each of the Four Major Categories 186 40 NW } 30 H • 20 cc g 10 Z 0 Dz 60 50 NW A • 40 H W • 30 cc W g 20 Dz 40 ti W > 30 W • 20 m W 10 Dz 10 0 40 N • 30 I U . • 20 cc W 0 IANIMATEI 1 I I SPATIAL I I SYSTEMSI INEURALI I I 1894 - 1925 - 1955 - 1915 1945 1975 drop across time in the number of animate - being metaphors , along with a less severe reduction in the use of spatial metaphors . Systems metaphors show the opposite trend : Starting as an unimportant cat - egory , with five members in the first tridecade , systems metaphors gradually come to predominate . They are largely responsible for the overall rise in metaphor use in the last tridecade . A 3 ( tridecades ) X 4 ( categories ) chi - square test verified that there are significant variations in the frequency of use of the four major categories across the three tridecades , X 2 ( 6 , N = 180 ) = 77 . 47 , p < . 0001 . To examine the shift more specifically , separate chi - square comparisons were performed for the six metaphor categories . For animate - being , spatial , and systems metaphors , the three tridecades differ sig - nificantly , X 2 ( 2 , N = 23 ) = 21 . 48 , p ( < . 001 ; X 2 ( 2 , N = 61 ) = 20 . 69 , p < . 001 ; and X ( 2 , N = 80 ) = 52 . 08 , p < . 001 , respectively . Idiosyncratic meta - phors , which are prevalent only in the early decades , also show a significant drop , X 2 ( 2 , N = 14 ) = 8 . 71 , p < . 05 . Neural metaphors and conventional meta - phors remain constant in number . Unlike the other three major categories , neural metaphors show no decrease in the intermediate tridecade ( 1925 - 1945 ) and no shift in frequency of use across time , X 2 ( 2 , N = 16 ) = 3 . 88 , ns . The possibly metaphoric con - ventional expressions show a similar pattern , re - maining at a constant level throughout , X 2 ( 2 , N = 71 ) = . 37 , ns . Thus , the individual analyses confirm a significant decrease in the numbers of animate - being , spatial , and idiosyncratic metaphors and a significant increase in the number of systems meta - phors , with no change in neural metaphors or conventional metaphors . A second way of looking at the pattern is to categorize each article according to its predominant type of metaphor . Thus , an article with five animate metaphors and two spatial metaphors would be categorized as animate . Table 3 shows the numbers of articles per tridecade in each of the four major categories . The patterns are virtually identical to those shown in Figure 1 , indicating that the results are not dependent on a particular method of analysis . The chi - square analysis for the 3 X 4 matrix of the major categories across tridecades was strongly sig - nificant , X ( 6 , N = 35 ) = 30 . 64 , p < . 0001 . When we extend the analysis to include the general and idiosyncratic metaphors , the results are the same , X2 ( 10 , N = 48 ) = 36 . 23 , p < . 0001 . A third way to trace the shift in preferred analogical domains is to record the most frequently used categories in each decade . Table 4 shows the two categories containing . the greatest numbers of metaphors in each decade . It can be seen that the shift from the early dominance of animate - being and spatial metaphors to the eventual dominance of 00 • 10 February 1985 • American Psychologist the one clear change occurs for image metaphors , Table 3 which are prominent in the early decades ( 1894 - Number of Articles per Tridecade with a Majority 1915 ) and become relatively infrequent afterward . of Their Mental Metaphors In Each Category Within systems metaphors , the earliest prominent subcategory is mechanical systems . Beginning in 1935 , a number of other subcategories came into use , notably mathematical , physical science , and symbol systems . In 1975 , computer systems meta - phors appear in large numbers . The distribution of metaphors across subcategories over the three tri - decade periods is shown in Table 5 . Discussion Reprise of Phenomena Two central patterns emerge from the examination of these mental metaphors . The major finding is the long - term shift in the content domains from which the metaphors were drawn . The domains that dom - inate in the first tridecade are supplanted by new categories by the end of the century . A second finding is the U - shaped pattern in the overall numbers of metaphors used in different periods . Metaphors for the mind are abundant at the outset of our sample ( 1894 - 1915 ) , drop sharply from approxi - mately 1925 to 1945 , and rise to even greater numbers during the most recent tridecade ( 1955 - 1975 ) . We will discuss the second pattern first , because its explication seems fairly straightforward . systems metaphors and spatial metaphors is a steady progression . Only during the middle tridecade , when metaphor use in general was at its lowest , did neural metaphors achieve relative prominence . Subcategories Two of these categories , spatial metaphors and sys - tems metaphors , have subcategories whose member - ship is large enough to warrant discussion . The subcategories of spatial metaphors are container metaphors , image metaphors , and a general spatial category . The subcategories of systems metaphors are mechanical systems , physical science systems , mathematical systems , symbol systems , computer systems , and general systems metaphors . Among the subcategories of spatial metaphors , Table 4 Numbers and Proportions of Metaphors in the Two Major Categories for Each Decade Note . Proportions were Obtained relative to the total number of metaphors . ' In 1925 , animate - being and systems metaphors each had one member .

Articles from this period tend to be straightforward reports of data , devoid of any discussion of the internal work - ings of the mind . Mental metaphors , like other mentalistic language , are rare . 3 Those metaphors that did occur during the middle decades often reflect mathematical models of the behavioral phe - nomena : for example , " goal gradient " ( Dennis , 1935 ) . The other class of metaphoric domain that is represented is neural metaphors : for example , " neural flux " ( Gray , 1935 ) . We will return below to the issue of why neural metaphors withstood the general moratorium on mental metaphors . Shift in the Content ofMetaphors The major pattern that emerges from the collection is the shift in the kinds of domains from which metaphors were drawn . Animate - being metaphors were used frequently in the early period , around the turn of the century , yet this category virtually dis - appeared by the middle tridecade . Spatial metaphors show a similar though less severe overall drop . They declined from their position as most dominant cat - egory at the turn of the century through a sharp depression in the middle tridecade , and although their numbers increased in the recent tridecade , they failed to reach their initial levels . However , it should be noted that many systems metaphors have a spatial substrate . As Roediger ( 1979 , 1980 ) pointed out , a large proportion of mental metaphors draw on spatial knowledge . Indeed , spatially organized domains are a particularly favored source of meta - phoric models in general ( Lakoff & Johnson , 1980 ; Reddy , 1979 ) . This is perhaps because perceptual space is among our most familiar and best understood areas of well - structured knowledge . Thus , the decline in the spatial category does not necessarily indicate a decline in the importance of spatial information but rather an increased reliance on analogies based on systems properties that go beyond the purely spatial . For example , the spatial notion of moving ideas into consciousness may be further specified in a computer systems metaphor as fetching and loading programs into working memory . As spatial metaphors declined , systems meta - phors increased from an extremely minor early role to become the dominant form . Further , within sys - tems metaphors , there was a marked proliferation in the kinds of systems that appeared . The early mechanical systems metaphors were joined by met - aphors drawn from mathematics , various branches of physics , and finally computer sciences . This shift in the kinds of metaphors seems a particularly inviting place to look for clues to the development of the psychology of thought . However , before drawing conclusions about conceptual evo - lution in psychology , we must consider a less inter - esting possibility . It could be that the changes in metaphor usage are attributable simply to a general tendency to use new technology as a source for metaphor . If this were true , then ( a ) psychological metaphors should reflect any major new technology and / or ( b ) the metaphors found in psychological writing will occur equally in other fields - economics , biology , and so on . We will consider these in turn . Jaynes ( 1976 ) noted that the most complex objects in our environment are often used as meta - phors for the mind . Certainly we found evidence for the impact of technology in the metaphors used by psychologists . The concentration of spatial image metaphors in the early decades of the study ( 1894 - 1915 ) may be linked to the development of photog - raphy in the second half of the nineteenth century . The metaphors in this category include an explicit photography metaphor ( Woodworth , 1915 ; see Table 2 ) as well as a number of references to such terms as " memory image " ( Bryan , 1894 ) and " mental picture before the mind ' s eye " ( Haines & Williams , 1905 ) . Later , a parallel is drawn between the nervous system and a " switchboard mechanism " ( Gray , 1935 ; see Table 2 ) , and still later an analogy is made between mental processing and a computer flowchart ( Carpenter & Just , 1975 ) . Some of these examples suggest a tendency to use newly available technology as a basis for con - structing analogies . Yet the influence of new tech - nology does not adequately explain the changes in analogical domains . For example , it is not until 1935 that we find the influence of mathematics and physics , with terms like " learning coefficients " ( Pe - terson , 1935 ) and " neural flux " ( Gray , 1935 ) . Yet mathematics and the physical sciences were formal systems well before psychologists made use of them in this way . Thus , newness of technology is not necessary for the use of a system in mental meta - phors . Further , other new technologies besides com - puter technology have grown up in the last hundred years , such as aviation , nuclear power , and television . Yet we find few metaphors from these domains , indicating that newness of technology is also not sufficient to guarantee use of a system in mental metaphors . There is selectivity in the choice of mental metaphors . Nor does it seem plausible that the shift in metaphors used in psychology simply reflects a 3 This is not to say that those articles contained no metaphoric general shift toward new technology metaphors across language , merely that they contained few metaphors for the mind . all °abstract domains . In politics and economics , for 188 February 1985 • American Psychologist I a example , contemporary writing makes heavy use of metaphors drawn from sports , hydraulics , and other domains but rarely from computer systems . Thus , the shift in preferred domain in psychology cannot be merely the result of indiscriminate borrowing of concepts from new technology . We wish instead to advance the possibility that the shift in the types of metaphors is related to changes in schools of thought in psychology . For example , the neural flux metaphors used in the middle tridecade may reveal the influence of Gestalt psychology ; the mathematical systems metaphors may be linked to the advent of information process - ing in cognitive psychology . Thus , there does appear to be a correlation between changes in metaphoric domains and changes in the dominant schools of psychology . In the remainder of this article we use the historical patterns of change in mental metaphors to gain insight into the changes in schools of psy - chology - or more precisely , the changes in the way in which psychologists thought about their subject matter . We turn now to an examination of the reasons that psychologists chose particular types of metaphors and the nature of the explanatory goals these met - aphors were intended to serve . To begin with , we pose three questions that will serve to organize the discussion : ( a ) What is the function of metaphor in scientific explanation ? ( b ) Are some explanatory metaphors better than others ? and ( c ) If so , have the mental metaphors in psychology improved over time ? The role of metaphor . Metaphor can serve a number of functions , and not all authors may have the same intent in introducing an analogy . One purpose a metaphor may serve is to convey an overall sense of complexity or potential richness without necessarily specifying precise mappings be - tween objects and relations in the analogical domain and the target domain ( the topic being explored ) . In such metaphors , the affective complex conveyed may be more important than any set of enumerable assertions that might be derivable from the metaphor . It can be argued that this expansive function of metaphor , emphasizing richness perhaps at the ex - pense of precision , underlies much of the use of metaphor in literature ( Gentner , 1982 ) . In scientific exposition , the communicative purpose of metaphor is often conceived of more stringently . An analogy or metaphor can allow the formulation of precise predictions in an unknown domain on the basis of known relationships in a familiar domain ( Gentner , 1983 ) . For example , Rutherford ' s comparison of the hydrogen atom to the solar system allowed a number of predictions concerning the structure of the hydrogen atom : that there is a smaller object that is peripheral to a larger object , that the smaller object revolves about this February 1985 • American Psychologist larger object , that the space between them is large relative to the size of the objects , and so on . ( See Hanson , 1958 , pp . 128 - 129 . For a fuller discussion of the role of metaphor in scientific reasoning , see Gentner , 1979 , 1982 , and Gentner and Gentner , 1983 ) . Differences in quality of metaphors . When a metaphor is used in an explanatory or predictive fashion , we may legitimately inquire whether it is a useful piece of explanation . There seem to be implicit criteria for judging the quality of an explanatory metaphor ( Gentner , 1982 ) . At least three principles seem to be involved : whether the object correspon - dences between domains are rigorously defined and preserved ( precision ) ; whether the immediate pre - dictions derived from these correspondences seem correct ( plausibility ) ; and , if both of the above conditions hold , whether the consequences are in - teresting and powerful . This last condition is in large part a matter of whether the predictions derivable from the metaphor form a coherent set of interrelated assertions , ° that is , whether the metaphor is system - atic . In general , an explanatory metaphor conveys a set of " attempted predications " ( Ortony , 1979 ) . In a systematic metaphor , these attempted predications form a mutually constraining set of interrelated , propositions from which further , perhaps quite un - expected , predictions can be derived . Systematic metaphors tend to be more valued as explanatory - predictive devices than as unsystematic metaphors , whose immediate predictions , even if demonstrably true , are not concatenatable and are thus unproduc - tive of new inferences . Have psychology metaphors improved ? The change in the kinds of analogical domains from which the metaphors are drawn is perhaps the most striking aspect of the data . The spatial and animate - being metaphors that dominate the early period are gradually supplanted by systems metaphors . This change occurs despite the considerable appeal of some of the early metaphors , which often seem livelier and more inventive than later metaphors . What underlies this change ? A remark by William James in his Principles of Psychology ( 1890 ) suggests a possibility : " At a certain stage in the development of every science a degree of vagueness is what best consists with fertil - ity " ( p . 6 ) . It seems likely that psychologists were gradually becoming uneasy with James ' s " degree of vagueness " and were seeking out explicit , systematic domains . Analogies to familiar phenomena serving a local descriptive purpose gave way to more precise analogies involving systems that , even if not univer - ` Such interrelations between lower order inferences can be represented as higher order propositions that take the lower order propositions as their arguments . 189 sally familiar , offered greater possibilities for expli - cation and prediction . James and other earlier writers may have used metaphor in the expansive , less precise sense de - scribed above . Certainly some of the early animate - being metaphors seem to lack systematicity : for example , " through lying , the mind grows wary or strong from swimming against the stream " ( Dewey , 1894 , p . 109 ) or " memory moves more easily from a name to a person [ its referent ] than the reverse , as a fish swims more easily from upriver down to the ocean " ( Starr , 1894 , pp . 91 , 92 ) . Neither of these seems to offer much beyond what is given ; the derived predictions for the target domain ( mental processes ) are rather shallow . ( Indeed , in the first example , it is not clear just how to set up a precise enough set of correspondences to allow an unambig - uous set of predictions . ) In contrast , when the analogical domain is a mathematical or physical system , the predicates imported into the target domain may participate in a tightly interconstrained predicate structure such that concatenations of immediate predictions into new predictions are possible . An example is the learning theory equation ( nestle , 1955 ) . 0 = r / r + i , where 0 is the conditioning constant , r is the number of relevant elements , and i is the number of irrelevant elements . The systematicity of the analogical domain of algebra is such that one can go beyond the immediate inferences . We can predict , for example , that 0 should rise with the number of relevant elements and decrease with the number of irrelevant elements ; that the ratio of relevant to irrelevant elements should be 0 / 1 - 0 ; and that , as the numbers of relevant and irrelevant elements approach equality , B should approach 0 . 5 , and so on . This is not to say that animate - being metaphors are always less clear or systematic relative to systems metaphors . The structure conveyed by a metaphor depends not only on the degree of systematicity in the analogical domain but also on the precision and aptness of the particular correspondences set up . It is certainly possible to find cases in which an early animate - being metaphor has served as a more sys - tematic metaphor than some of the later systems metaphors . For example , James ( 1905 ) used a met - aphor of an animal driver with his yoked animals to describe a hierarchical system of higher order ideas controlling , but depending on , lower order thought processes . In the course of this pre - scient analogy , " long - span activities " are described as " yoking , " " encouraging , " and " steering " " short - span activities " ( p . 12 ) . This metaphor conveys a number of complex concepts : the notions of hier - archies of goals with nested scope , the notion of an interdependent system of partially autonomous units , and so forth . Its precision and systematicity seem at 190 least as high as in such later systems metaphors as " action - specific energy " ( Moltz , 1965 ) or " efficiency as a function of the ratio of focused to diffuse activity " ( Wishner , 1955 , p . 79 ) . Nevertheless , the overall pattern suggests that psychologists ' criteria for explanatory metaphor , or perhaps their concep - tion of appropriate standards for their profession , have altered in favor of more systematic , explicit metaphors . Neural Metaphors : Vigilance and Quality At this point a subtle yet important question arises of the degree to which a particular metaphor is used as an intentional metaphor , as opposed to being invoked unconsciously . Without denying the useful - ness of a serendipitous , initially unconscious meta - phorical association in creativity or discovery , as described by Koestler ( 1964 ) and others , the advan - tages of recognizing a metaphor at the time of writing seem clear . The writer can ensure that the metaphor is precise , that concepts and relations in the base domain are mapped clearly to the corre - sponding items in the target domain , and that there is no confusion of the two domains or unwarranted assumption of causality . Conscious scrutiny of an explanatory metaphor is an important aspect of productive usage because , as one of the authors surveyed in this study noted , " analogies are too tricky to be given free reign " ( Heidbreder , 1945 , p . 5 ) . Analogies commonly begin as imprecise feelings of likeness and are made precise only through careful , often sustained , analysis ( Gentner , 1982 ; Polya , 1973 ) . An unaware user of a metaphor may be unable to follow Lewontin ' s ( 1981 ) warning that " the price of metaphor is eternal vigilance " ( p . 245 ) . Indeed , Boyd ( 1979 ) has pointed out that the analysis and explication of scientific metaphors are taken to be the shared enterprise of the scientific community ( much more so than with literary metaphor ) . All of this suggests that , aside from the degree of potential aptness of a given metaphor , an impor - tant determinant of the success of an analogical enterprise is the conscious analysis of the analogy . In this connection , one may speculate that a meta - phor is most dangerous when it possesses a false credibility . The example that arises here is the neural metaphor . There is , of course , a legitimate , rigorously correct way to use a neural metaphor for a mental process : namely , to convey the position that the same principles of organization hold within the mental domain as within the neural domain . How - ever , one suspects that the fact that the neural domain forms a causal substrate for the mental domain tends to give metaphors drawn from neu - rophysiology a spurious authority . It may be that neural metaphors are particularly likely to go unex - February 1985 • American Psychologist 4 4 amined . The causal connection between physiological organization and the organization of the mind , though irrelevant from the point of view of the metaphor , may _ lead to a decrease in vigilance . This would mean first , that neural metaphors should be less detectable as metaphors , and second , that neural metaphors should be less subject to the kind of analytical scrutiny that leads to precision and sys - tematicity . The patterns found here accord with these suggestions . The steady presence of a small number of neural metaphors , even in the antimentalistic middle tridecade , suggests that these metaphors had a respectability that allowed them to be used even when most mental metaphors were avoided . Further , it seemed to us that , in general , the neural metaphors were particularly careless . We find metaphors such as " gray matter as images or concepts , with white matter as associations between them " ( Starr , 1894 , pp . 88 - 89 ) ; " neural impulses shifting along associa - tive fibers from one area to another " ( Dashiell , 1925 , p . 55 ) ; and " shortcircuiting too large an amount of excitation " ( Arnold , 1945 , p . 47 ) . It may indeed be that the closeness of the base and target domains for neural metaphors effected a decrease in vigilance in analyzing the analogical structure . Conclusions The mental metaphors of psychology have changed rather strikingly in the past 90 years . The early animate - being metaphors have virtually disappeared , and the spatial metaphors that also flourished in the first 30 years of American psychology have receded to a minor category . In their place we find steadily increasing numbers of systems metaphors , and most recently of computer systems metaphors in particular . American psychology appears to be converging on a common framework of explanation for cognitive phenomena . This convergence is further marked by a decrease in the numbers of idiosyncratic metaphors . What makes computer systems metaphors so popular ? Certainly the adoption of these computer systems metaphors does not guarantee either rigor of application or interestingness of results . Use of the computer metaphor does not even guarantee avoidance of animism . Terms like " retrieving , " " de - tecting , " and " searching " can all describe human behaviors as well as machine operations , and this ambiguity is sometimes exploited in vague analogiz - ing . It has been observed that an entire homunculus can be concealed within one processing box in a flow diagram ( Mandler , 1978 ) . Nevertheless , a com - puter analogy can represent a genuine simplification , if the powers of the individual processors are sternly limited . As Dennett ( 1978 ) put it , " if one can get a team or committee of relatively ignorant , narrow - minded , blind homunculi to produce the intelligent February 1985 • American Psychologist behavior of the whole , this is progress " ( p . 123 ) . Further , the potential breadth and systematicity of these systems make them powerful tools with which to work . Sacrificed , perhaps , is the sense of richness that is possible with metaphors that are not fully specified , that retain a degree of vagueness . Meta - phors like " through lying , the mind grows wary or strong from swimming against the stream " ( Dewey , 1894 , p . 109 ) and " striving itself had drawn or pulled them [ words ] into actuality " ( James , 1905 , p . 13 ) have an almost literary wealth of connotative possibilities . It is tempting to conclude that there has indeed been a change in the degree of vagueness tolerated in modeling and that the current analogies are more conducive to progress in understanding the mind . According to the thesis assumed here , though , our judgments must be cautious , because we see through the metaphors of our time . Our own frameworks remain to be evaluated . REFERENCES Arnold , M .
