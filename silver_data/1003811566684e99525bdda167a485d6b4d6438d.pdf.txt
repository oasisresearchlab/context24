Even after completion of a study , authors sometimes choose not to submit their work for publication because they are not satis ﬁ ed with the results ( i . e . , the “ ﬁ le drawer ” problem ) ( 1 ) , or they encounter dif ﬁ culties with get - ting results published because of reviewer or editorial bias ( “ publication bias ” ) ( 2 – 4 ) . Although prepublication biases have been well described in epidemiologic textbooks , postpublication biases , such as selective citation , have been less well documented . “ Citation bias ” occurs when scientists selectively cite papers based upon risk estimates that conform to their preconceived no - tions ( 5 ) . When researchers have a bias in favor of “ X causing Y , ” they are more likely to cite papers that found evidence to support their view . Conversely , when researchers harbor a bias against a hypothesized association , they may selectively cite papers that report null ﬁ ndings . Here , we use research on job strain and the risk of coronary heart disease to examine factors that in ﬂ uence citations in peer - reviewed literature . In addition to the risk estimate for job strain relative to no job strain in each study , we take into account the impact factor of the publishing journal , which is an indicator of its prestige . METHODS We used the most recent meta - analysis of job strain and incident coronary heart disease to identify relevant studies for this analysis ( 6 ) . According to the total evidence from this meta - analysis ( 26 studies ) , employees who experienced job strain had 1 . 34 ( 95 % con ﬁ dence interval ( CI ) : 1 . 18 , 1 . 51 ) times greater disease risk than did those free of job strain ( 6 ) . To allow an adequate period of time for citations to accumu - late , we focused on papers published at least 10 years ago , which yielded a total of 7 cohort studies ( Table 1 ) ( 7 – 13 ) . For each study , we obtained relative risk estimates for the job strain – heart disease association , counted citations in the Scopus ( Elsevier , Amsterdam , the Netherlands ) and Web - of - Science ( Thompson Reuters , New York , New York ) data - bases , and obtained the impact factor of the publishing journal from Web - of - Science Journal Citations 2013 . In addition , we obtained an indicator of the scienti ﬁ c quality of each study from a review ( 14 ) in which the authors had based their eval - uation on 8 criteria ( e . g . , the characteristics of the study pop - ulation , validity of the exposure measurement and outcome ascertainment , and comprehensiveness of adjustments for confounding factors ) . A higher score indicated higher quality ( range , 0 – 12 ) ( 14 ) . We computed the associations of effect size and journal impact factor with the number of citations using general lin - ear models ( procedure glm in Stata , version 11 . 2 ; StataCorp LP , College Station , Texas ) . Both analyses were adjusted for Table 1 .

RESULTS The total number of citations for the 7 studies was 1 , 382 in Scopus and 1 , 305 in Web - of - Science . In the most - cited paper , job strain was reported to double the disease risk ( Table 1 ) ( 11 ) . In contrast , the least - cited paper reported a null ﬁ nding ( 10 ) . There was a general trend toward higher fre - quencies of citations for papers that reported a higher risk ratio ( 7 – 13 ) . After controlling for citation - time , we found that each 10 % increase in reported excess risk was associated with 16 . 5 ( 95 % CI : 7 . 9 , 25 . 0 ) additional citations in Scopus ( P = 0 . 001 , adjusted R 2 = 0 . 69 ) and 12 . 4 ( 95 % CI : 1 . 1 , 23 . 7 ) additional citations in Web - of - Science ( P = 0 . 03 , adjusted R 2 = 0 . 31 ) . Moreover , a higher journal impact factor was associated with a higher citation frequency , although this was imprecisely estimated , as evidenced by the wide con ﬁ dence intervals ( in Scopus , per each 1 - point increase in impact factor , change in citations = 13 . 9 , 95 % CI : − 2 . 8 , 30 . 6 , P = 0 . 10 , adjusted R 2 = 0 . 15 ; in Web - of - Science , change in citations = 14 . 3 , 95 % CI : 0 . 5 , 28 . 0 , P = 0 . 04 , adjusted R 2 = 0 . 27 ) . High - quality evidence was seemingly not a priority when authors decided which articles to cite . The most - cited study had the lowest scienti ﬁ c quality score ( 4 ) of all papers ( 11 ) . In contrast , the 2 least - cited studies obtained a quality score of 8 , which was the highest received ( 9 , 10 ) . DISCUSSION By analyzing the frequency of citation of papers that exam - ined the relation of job strain with coronary heart disease , we showed that higher - quality science in this ﬁ eld did not garner more citations . In contrast , studies that reported higher risk estimates were cited more frequently than those that reported lower risk estimates . Similarly , as described elsewhere ( 5 ) , there was a tendency for articles that were published in the more prestigious journals to be cited more often . A strength of the present analysis is that we targeted re - search on a speci ﬁ c topic . This facilitated a straightforward comparison between studies . Study quality was determined based on a score obtained from an independent review ( 14 ) ; unfortunately , this score was missing for one of the target papers ( 12 ) . The main limitation of our investigation is the small num - ber of studies included in the analyses ( 7 – 13 ) . Our ﬁ ndings should therefore be interpreted in this context ; it is unknown whether they are generalizable to other areas of epidemiology . More general limitations of examining citations as an outcome include the fact that citation bias may be bi - directional ; for ex - ample , tobacco industry – funded researchers may be motivated to cite studies that found null associations between smoking and disease . Further , a citation could be included in a critical context or as counterfactual evidence . However , our ﬁ ndings are in agreement with those from previous studies . In an examination of citations of published articles that were originally submitted to an emergency med - icine specialty meeting , Callaham et al . ( 2 ) found that the strength of methodology and study design did not predict the frequency of citations during a 3 . 5 - year follow - up . Posi - tive outcome bias was not observed either , but the constituent studies were focused on a heterogeneous set of topics ( 2 ) . Jannot et al . ( 5 ) retrieved citation counts of speci ﬁ c therapeutic intervention studies and found that studies with statistically signi ﬁ cant ﬁ ndings were cited twice as often as those with nonsigni ﬁ cant ﬁ ndings . Similarly , Andrade et al . ( 15 ) reported that trials that reported favorable outcomes for surgery to alle - viate chronic nonspeci ﬁ c low back pain tended to be cited more often than those that reported less favorable results . Selective publication and citation can in ﬂ uence the con - struction of scienti ﬁ c knowledge and even lead to nonoptimal choices for prevention . Researchers as well as journal review - ers and editors need to pay more attention to these biases . As the number of large - scale individual - participant meta - analyses and the amount of data sharing increase within the research community , epidemiology as a science can become more transparent and self - critical .
