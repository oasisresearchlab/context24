Transcription of the eukaryotic genome is carried out by nuclear RNA polymerase I ( Pol I ) , Pol II and Pol III . Whereas Pol I transcribes the rRNA precur - sor , Pol III transcribes small non - coding RNAs such as tRNAs . Pol II is a 12 - subunit enzyme that transcribes protein - coding genes to produce mRNAs . Pol II regu - lation underlies cell differentiation , the maintenance of cell identity and the responses of cells to environmen - tal changes . It occurs at different stages of transcrip - tion , although regulation at the stage of initiation is a key mechanism for the control of gene expression . Understanding Pol II regulation , therefore , requires detailed insights into the structure of the Pol II ini - tiation complex and the molecular mechanisms of transcriptio n initiation . For initiation , Pol II assembles with the general transcription factors TFIIB , TFIID , TFIIE , TFIIF and TFIIH , which are collectively known as the gen - eral transcription factors , at promoter DNA to form the pre - initiation complex ( PIC ) ( TABLE 1 ) . According to exemplary studies with a subset of promoters , the general transcription factors cooperate with Pol II to bind to and open promoter DNA , and to initiate RNA synthesis and stimulate the escape of Pol II from the promoter . TFIID contains the TATA box - binding pro - tein ( TBP ) and several TBP - associated factors ( TAFs ) . Whereas TBP is required for transcription from all promoters , the TAFs have promoter - specific func - tions . Order - of - addition experiments 1 combined with in vivo analysis led to the classical model of stepwise PIC assembly ( reviewed in REFS 2 – 6 ) , although alternative assembly pathways are possible . In the classical model , a Pol II – TFIIF complex binds to a pre - formed TFIIB – TBP – DNA promoter complex , resulting in the formation of a core initiation complex ( FIG . 1 ) . The core initiation complex is conserved in the Pol I and Pol III transcription systems , which also use TBP and contain proteins with homologies to TFIIB and TFIIF ( reviewed in REF . 7 ) . The core initiation complex binds to TFIIE and TFIIH to form a complete PIC that contains closed , double - stranded promoter DNA ( TABLE 1 ) . In the presence of nucleoside triphosphates , a central DNA region is melted , leading to a ‘transcription bubble’ and the formation of the open promoter complex . In the open promoter complex , the DNA template strand passes near the Pol II active site and can programme DNA - templated RNA chain synthesis . Most general transcription fac - tors are modular and contain structured domains that are connected by flexible linkers . Upon assembly of the PIC , these factors adopt their functional structure . Their linker regions fold on the Pol II surface , and their protein domains locate to sites where they can exhibit specialized functions . Detailed structural information on how gen - eral factors interact with Pol II is scarce , but recent studies have increased our understandin g of the 3D architecture of initiatio n complexes 8 – 13 . In this Review , we summarize known structural information on Pol II initiation complexes and discuss the functions of PIC components . We describe available structures for the general transcription factors and their complexes ( TABLE 2 ; see Supplementary information S1 ( table ) ) , following the order of the stepwise assembly model of PIC formation .

All rights reserved the core initiation complex and the interaction of this complex with the auxiliary factor TFIIA . We then dis - cuss TFIIE and TFIIH and their roles in promoter DNA opening . Finally , we discuss how recent data on the structure of TFIID provide insights into its functions in determinin g promoter specificity . A brief history of initiation complex architecture Structural analyses of the PIC started over two decades ago . Structures of TBP in free form 14 , 15 and bound to DNA 16 , 17 revealed that TBP is a saddle - shaped molecule that binds to the DNA minor groove and bends DNA by 90 degrees . In later structures , TFIIA and TFIIB were seen to flank the TBP – DNA complex on either side 18 – 20 . When the yeast Pol II structure became available 21 – 25 , it revealed many domains that have putative functions during initiation , including the dock , wall and clamp domains , and an RNA exit tunnel . The challenge then was to understand the relative positions of TFIIB and Pol II , because subsequent superimposition of the known TFIIB – TBP – DNA complex would reveal the position of TBP and promoter DNA on Pol II . The B - ribbon ( also known as the amino - terminal zinc ribbon ) domain of TFIIB was found to be located on the Pol II dock domain using biochemical probing 26 and X - ray crystallography 27 ( BOX 1 ) . As this domain was not present in the TFIIB – TBP – DNA complex structure 19 , a model for the Pol II – TFIIB – TBP – DNA complex had to be derived with the use of site - specific protein cleavage probing 28 , 29 ( BOX 1 ) . In 2009 , the structure of the complete 12 - subunit Pol II bound by TFIIB confirmed the location of the B - ribbon domain on the dock and positioned one of two cyclin folds in the carboxy - terminal B - core domain of TFIIB on the Pol II wall 10 . This enabled modelling of Pol II – TFIIB – TBP – DNA complexes with closed and open promoter DNA 10 . An independent TFIIB structure bound to the 10 - subunit Pol II core enzyme provided similar results 11 . The crystallographically derived models also resembled the models that were derived biochemi - cally 28 , 29 . A recently obtained high - resolution crystal structure of a Pol II – TFIIB complex ( FIG . 2a ) additionally contained DNA and a short RNA transcript , and revealed details about the TFIIB ‘B - reader’ and ‘B - linker’ regions that connect the B - ribbon to the B - core and run through the polymerase active centre cleft 30 .

Crosslinking of the core initiation complex confirmed the Pol II – TFIIF – TFIIB – TBP – DNA model 12 . In 2013 , the stepwise assembly of a human PIC was visualized by electron microscopy ( EM ) 9 . In this study , TFIIF , TFIIE and TFIIH were sequentially added to a complex comprising Pol II , TFIIB , TBP , DNA and TFIIA . The architecture of the human PIC showed a remarkable similarity to the yeast core initiation com - plex ( FIG . 2b ) . Additionally , it revealed locations of TFIIE on the polymerase clamp domain that were consistent with the locations of the homologous yeast factor 8 , 33 , and a downstream location of TFIIH that was also topo - logically similar to that derived for the yeast complex 8 ( FIG . 3a ) . The human PIC architecture derived by EM was also consistent with that derived by early DNA – protein photo - crosslinking experiments that located TFIIH near DNA downstream of the initiation complex 34 . A different PIC architecture was suggested by an alternative study that analysed the yeast PIC by EM and located TFIIH above the Pol II cleft 13 . Very recently , an alternative study of the yeast initiation complex structure 249 consistent with the human study 9 was published . TBP and promoter binding The first step in canonical PIC assembly is the sequence - specific binding of TBP to the TATA box . The TATA box has a consensus sequence of TATAWAWR 35 and is located around 30 bp upstream of the transcription start site ( TSS ) in humans . There is early evidence that the factor that binds to the TATA box is functionally con - served from yeast to humans 36 and that the TBP sub - unit of TFIID is sufficient for transcription in vitro 37 , 38 and in vivo 39 . Although most promoters do not contain canonical TATA boxes ( TATA - less promoters ) , TBP and other general factors were located genome - wide on most promoters in yeast 40 . TBP can bind to and bend variants of TATA DNA 41 , which suggests that the over - all architecture of the initiation complex is similar at TATA - containing and TATA - less promoters . Free TBP has a saddle - shaped structure 14 , 15 . Structures of TBP bound to the TATA box DNA in yeast 17 , plant 16 , 42 and human 43 – 45 cells uncovered a highly conserved bind - ing mode . The concave surface of TBP binds to the minor groove of the TATA box , inducing a ~ 90 - degree bend in the DNA . Although TBP binds to DNA with nano molar affinity 16 , relatively few base - specific DNA contacts were observed . DNA specificity apparently results from the propensity of the A / T - rich DNA to form a hydro - phobic surface that is complementary to TBP . The abil - ity of TBP to bind to various DNA sequences probably enables it to function in transcription initiation by any of the three eukaryotic RNA polymerases ( reviewed in REF . 7 ) . Investigating how transcription initiates at TATA - less promoters remains an important goal for the future . The auxiliary factor TFIIA is not required for basal transcription but can stabilize the TBP – DNA comple x 46 . TFIIA is Pol II - specific and stimulates constitutive transcription ( that is , transcription at basal levels ) and activated transcription 47 .

All rights reserved and human 48 TFIIA – TBP – DNA complexes revealed a boot - shaped TFIIA heterodimer that does not alter the TBP – DNA structure ( see figure 3a in REF . 18 ) . TFIIA is composed of two conserved domains , a 4 - helix bundle and a 12 - stranded β - barrel that binds to the upstream region of the TATA box and the underside of the TBP saddle , which explains how TFIIA stabilizes the TBP – DNA complex . Consistent with this , the stability of the TFIIA – TBP – DNA complex depends on the sequence of the DNA that is bound 49 . TFIIB and Pol II recruitment TFIIB is required for Pol II recruitment to the pro - moter 50 – 53 and facilitates TBP binding to DNA and DNA bending 54 . The functions of TFIIB in the recruitment of Pol II and in the interaction of TBP with promoter DNA are due to its N - and C - terminal domains , respec - tively 55 – 57 . Structural studies revealed an N - terminal B - ribbon domain 58 , 59 and a C - terminal B - core region , which contains two cyclin domains that bind to TBP and upstream DNA 19 , 60 . In the archaeal transcription system , TBP and the TFIIB homologue , TFB , are the only required initiation factors 61 , and the structure of an archaeal TBP – TFB – DNA complex resembles that of its eukaryotic counterpart 62 . TFIIB interacts with the flanking regions of the TATA box to bind to upstream and downstream DNA sequences that can contain TFIIB recognition element s ( from here on referred to as B recognition ele - ments ( BREs ) ) 63 – 65 . Recognition of BREs can explain oriented assembly of the initiation complex despite the pseudo - symmetri c nature of the TBP – DNA complex 66 – 68 . Structures of Pol II – TFIIB complexes showed how the B - ribbon of TFIIB binds to the dock domain of Pol II to recruit the polymerase 27 and later showed that the first cyclin domain in the B - core region is located on the wall Figure 1 | Schematic of Pol II transcription initiation . Depicted is the canonical model for stepwise pre - initiation complex ( PIC ) assembly from general transcription factors ( various colours ) and RNA polymerase II ( Pol II ; grey ) on promoter DNA . The names for the intermediate complexes that form during the initiation – elongation transition are provided to the left of the images . TFIID or its TATA box - binding protein ( TBP ) subunit binds to promoter DNA , inducing a bend . The TBP – DNA complex is then stabilized by TFIIB and TFIIA , which flank TBP on both sides . The resulting upstream promoter complex is joined by the Pol II – TFIIF complex , leading to the formation of the core PIC . Subsequent binding of TFIIE and TFIIH complete the PIC . In the presence of ATP , the DNA is opened ( forming the ‘transcription bubble’ ) and RNA synthesis commences . Finally , dissociation of initiation factors enables the formation of the Pol II elongation complex , which is associated with transcription elongation factors ( blue ) .

All rights reserved of Pol II to position DNA over the Pol II active centre cleft 10 , 11 . By combining the crystal structures of the Pol II – TFIIB complexes with the structure of the TFIIB – TBP – DNA complex , models of closed and open promoter complexes containing TFIIB , TBP , DNA and Pol II were obtained 10 , 11 ( FIG . 3b ) that closely resemble the models derived biochemically 28 and that explain how TBP and TFIIB cooperate to load promoter DNA onto Pol II . Post - recruitment functions of TFIIB . The Pol II – TFIIB structures also revealed that the TFIIB region connect - ing the B - ribbon and B - core domains traverses the Pol II cleft 10 , 11 to form two distinct elements , the B - reader and B - linker 10 . Following the N - terminal B - ribbon , the polypeptide chain runs along the polymerase RNA exit channel in the opposite direction to exiting RNA and continues through the cleft , forming a B - reader helix and a B - linker helix 10 . A structure of an initially transcribing Pol II – TFIIB complex containing template DNA and a six - nucleotide RNA transcript revealed the entire course of the TFIIB polypeptide in the Pol II cleft 30 ( FIG . 2a ) . The B - reader used both its helix and an ordered loop to con - tact the DNA template strand and was stabilized by the B - reader strand that packs against the Pol II lid element . The structural information elucidated how TFIIB 69 , 70 functions in setting the TSS 52 , 71 – 75 and revealed new post - recruitment functions . First , the B - linker helix is located in the region above the cleft where DNA opening com - mences 10 . The B - linker helix plays a part in DNA open - ing and / or the maintenance of the transcription bubble 10 . Second , the B - reader loop binds to the template strand to position DNA for the initiation of RNA chain synthe - sis and to contribute to the recognition of the initiator DNA sequence 30 . Third , TFIIB stimulates initial RNA synthesis , apparently by allosterically rearranging active site residues and stabilizing a closed polymerase clamp 30 . Fourth , TFIIB stabilizes an early initiation complex con - taining a five - nucleotide RNA strand 27 , and the B - reader loop blocks the path of the RNA beyond six nucleotides and may aid DNA – RNA strand separation by directing the RNA to the exit tunnel 30 . Last , TFIIB is released from the complex when the RNA reaches a length of 12 – 13 nucleotides 76 and clashes with the B - ribbon 30 . The inter - play between TFIIB and nucleic acids is critical for the initiation - to - elongation transition 77 . In contrast to human Pol II , which initiates transcription around 30 bp down - stream of the TATA box , yeast Pol II scans DNA for a site of RNA chain initiation further downstream 73 , but the mechanistic basis for this difference remains unknown . TFIIF and its initiation functions TFIIF was identified in mammalian cells owing to its interaction with Pol II 78 , 79 . TFIIF is a heterodimer of subunits TFIIFα ( also known as RAP74 ) and TFIIFβ ( also known as RAP30 ) 80 , 81 . These two subunits cor - respond to Tfg1 and Tfg2 in yeast , respectively 82 . However , yeast TFIIF additionally contains Tfg3 , a third subunit that is non - essential for transcription 83 , less tightly associated and also a component of other protein complexes 84 , 85 . Approximately 50 % of Pol II is associated with TFIIF in a yeast cell 86 . TFIIF prevents non - specific interaction of Pol II with DNA 87 and sta - bilizes the PIC 88 , in particular stabilizing TFIIB within the PIC 76 , 89 . TFIIF also influences TSS selection 90 , stimu lates phosphodiester bond formation and early RNA synthesis 91 – 93 , and suppresses Pol II pausing 94 . TFIIF further contributes to the stabilization of the transcription bubble , and transcription can be initi - ated to some extent in vitro in the absence of TFIIE and TFIIH but not if TFIIF is also absent 95 . Box 1 | Experimental methods used to elucidate the Pol II initiation complex structure Site - specific protein cleavage probing Chemical probes are incorporated at specific sites of a protein within a protein complex and buffer conditions are changed such that these probes induce the cleavage of nearby protein backbone chains . If the structure of the nearby proteins is known , the approximate position of a protein containing the probes on the surface of a protein complex can be derived . X - ray crystallography The protein complex of interest is purified and crystallized . The crystal structure is then determined using synchrotron radiation and X‑ray diffraction . X‑ray crystallography normally results in highly reliable 3D atomic structures . The drawbacks of this method are that a large quantity of protein must be prepared and that often crystals of sufficient quality cannot be obtained . Cryo - electron microscopy The purified protein complex is suspended in a thin layer of liquid on a grid , flash - frozen and imaged under the electron microscope . The obtained images of thousands of single particles are aligned in the computer , and the 3D structure is calculated from back‑projection by combining images from different views after determining their relative orientations . The advantage of this method is that a lower amount of material is required compared to X - ray crystallography . The disadvantage is that often the resolution of this method is insufficient to derive molecular mechanistic insights , although topological insights can generally be obtained . Recent advances in detector technology have led to a dramatic increase in resolution , and detailed insights are expected from electron microscopy in the future . Crosslinking and mass spectrometry The protein complex of interest is incubated with a bifunctional chemical crosslinking reagent that covalently links surface lysine residues . After protease digestion , the resulting peptides are analysed by mass spectrometry and sites of crosslinking are identified by analysis of the obtained data . Interprotein crosslinks can then be used to verify the complex models obtained after fitting available crystal structures to cryo‑electron microscopic maps .

The N - terminal regions of TFIIFα and TFIIFβ form a dimerization module with a triple barrel fold and a protruding β - hairpin , also known as an ‘arm’ ( REF . 96 ) . Both subunits also contain a C - terminal winged helix ( WH ) domain 97 , 98 . The WH domains are connected to the dimerization module by a charged region in TFIIFα and a linker region in TFIIFβ 31 , 32 , 99 . In contrast to a canon - ical WH domain , the TFIIFα WH domain contains an extra α - helix between helices H2 and H3 ( REF . 98 ) , and a pocket composed of H2 and H3 that binds the Pol II phosphatas e FCP1 ( also known as CTDP1 ) 100 , 101 . Mechanisms of TFIIF function . Structural studie s of Pol II complexes with TFIIF elucidated how TFIIF accomplishes its functions during initiation . The TFIIF dimerization module anchors TFIIF to Pol II and binds to the Pol II lobe on one side of the cleft near downstream DNA 31 – 33 . The WH domain of Tfg2 is located near the protrusion 31 , 32 and upstream DNA 29 . The Tfg2 WH domain is mobile in the Pol II – TFIIF complex but is located near DNA in initiation complexes 9 , 12 , 31 . These results were consistent with early reports that TFIIFβ suffices to recruit Pol II to a promoter complex 102 , 103 , and explained why the WH domain in TFIIFβ is required for function 104 and how it binds to DNA 97 , 105 . The Tfg2 WH domain seems to interact with the BRE downstream of the TATA box and with the B - core region of TFIIB 9 , which explains how it stabilizes the upstream promoter complex and TFIIB 76 , 89 . Current data do not support an early EM model of the Pol II – TFIIF complex 106 . Figure 2 | Architecture of the core Pol II initiation complex . a | On the left , a ribbon model of the crystal structure of the initially transcribing RNA polymerase II ( Pol II ) – TFIIB complex 30 ( RCSB Protein Data Bank code 4BBS ) is shown . The structure reveals the different functional domains of TFIIB ( green ) and their relative locations with respect to Pol II ( grey ) and nucleic acids . Key elements of TFIIB are labelled , including the B - linker helix , which is involved in DNA opening and / or open DNA stabilization , and the B - reader loop , which is assumed to be involved in RNA strand ( red ) separation from the DNA template ( dark blue ) .

The models illustrate how general factors enable Pol II to engage with the promoter . In the yeast complex , the Tfg2 winged helix ( WH ) domain was also observed near upstream DNA on the outside of Pol II . Comparison of the yeast and human complexes shows that the 3D architecture of the transcription initiation complex is conserved throughout eukaryotes , reflecting the conservation of Pol II and the initiation factors . Pol II is viewed from the top 25 . TBP , TATA box - binding protein .

Both EM 9 and crosslinking 12 data indicated that two elements emanate from the TFIIF dimerization module — the Tfg1 arm and charged helix . The arm and charged helix extend into the Pol II cleft near downstream DNA , which sug - gests how they function in TSS selection 107 , 108 and initial RNA synthesis 91 , 108 , 109 , respectively . Interactions of TFIIF with DNA both upstream and downstream of the TATA box explain early protein – DNA crosslinking patterns 34 , 110 . TFIIE and TFIIH TFIIE and TFIIH are required for promoter DNA open - ing . TFIIH was identified as a factor required for tran - scription in vitro 111 – 114 . TFIIH contains DNA - dependent ATPase activity 111 that is essential for transcription initia - tion 2 , 115 . Transcription assays with supercoiled , linear or mismatched DNA showed that TFIIH functions in pro - moter opening 116 and escape 117 , 118 . Additionally , TFIIH functions in the DNA nucleotide excision repair path - way 115 , 119 . TFIIE binds to Pol II 120 but not to the upstream promoter complex on the TATA box 121 . TFIIE 33 facilitates the recruitment of TFIIH to the initiation complex 122 , thus providing a bridge between Pol II and TFIIH 116 , 123 . Figure 3 | TFIIH and promoter opening . a | Ribbon models of the yeast pre - initiation complex ( PIC ) 8 and the human PIC 9 ( cryo - electron microscopy density is shown as a transparent surface ) are shown . The Tfg2 winged helix ( WH ) domain is apparently mobile because it is located near the protrusion in the yeast PIC model 8 , whereas it is positioned above DNA in the yeast core initiation complex 12 ( FIG . 2b ) . The ATPase subunit of TFIIH ( known as XPB in humans and Ssl2 in yeast ) is located at downstream DNA .

The location of Ssl2 at downstream DNA and the apparent movement of DNA during promoter opening are indicated by arrows . According to the current model for DNA opening , the ATPase Ssl2 functions as a translocase that threads downstream DNA into the active centre cleft of Pol II while upstream DNA remains fixed .

All rights reserved It also stimulates the DNA - dependent ATPase and kinase activity of TFIIH 124 . TFIIE alone can open certain pro - moters and stabilize the open promoter complex 116 , 123 , probably by binding to single - stranded DNA 125 , 126 . TFIIE and its functions . TFIIE is a heterodimer of the subunits TFIIEα and TFIIEβ 127 , 128 , which both have distant homology to the bacterial initiation factor sigma 129 , 130 . TFIIEα is composed of an N - terminal WH domain , a central zinc - finger domain and a C - terminal acidic domain . The N - terminal half of TFIIEα is suffi - cient for interaction with TFIIEβ and transcription func - tions 131 . TFIIEβ contains two WH domains that resemble a tandem WH domain found in Pol I 132 and a basic C - terminal region . Structures of the TFIIE domains are available . The structure of the archaeal homologue of the N - terminal part of TFIIEα , TFE , revealed an extended WH domain that had extra helices on the N and C ter - mini , and indicated that the domain does not interact with DNA 133 . The essential zinc - finger domain from human TFIIEα has a novel topology 134 . The C - terminal acidic region forms a compact domain 135 that is required for strong interaction with TFIIH 131 , apparently through binding of the pleckstrin homology domain of p62 in TFIIH 135 . The first half of the two WH domains of TFIIEβ was structurally resolved and shown to bind to DNA in vitro 136 . The C - terminal region of TFIIEβ also binds to single - stranded DNA 137 . Structural information on the location of TFIIE on Pol II indicates how TFIIE stabilizes the open promoter complex . According to crosslinking experiments , TFIIEβ is located just upstream of the TSS 138 and TFIIEα also approaches the DNA in this region 139 . TFIIE binds to the Pol II clamp domain 33 , as does archaeal TFE 140 . Site - specific cleavage analysis showed that the three WH domains of TFIIE are close together within the PIC , with the TFIIEα WH domain anchoring the complex to the polymerase clamp and the two WH domains in TFIIEβ encircling promoter DNA 8 . EM of a human PIC con - taining TFIIE revealed an extended density following a path from the WH domain of TFIIFβ over DNA and the clamp to the peripheral Pol II subcomplex RPB4 – RPB7 ( REF . 9 ) . Thus , four WH domains , one from TFIIF and three from TFIIE , span over the polymerase cleft contain - ing loaded DNA 9 . The TFIIE zinc finger may be located near the Pol II subcomplex RPB4 – RPB7 ( REF . 9 ) , which is consistent with data from archaea 9 , 140 . TFIIH and promoter DNA opening . TFIIH is a 10 - sub - unit factor that , in humans , consists of the ATPase XPB ( known as Ssl2 in yeast ) ; a six - subunit core module com - prising XPD ( also an ATPase ; Rad3 in yeast ) , p62 ( Tfb1 in yeast ) , p52 ( Tfb2 in yeast ) , p34 ( Tfb4 in yeast ) , p8 ( Tfb5 in yeast ) and p44 ( Ssl1 in yeast ) ; and the three - subunit kinase module CDK7 – cyclin H – MAT1 ( Kin28 – Ccl1 – Tfb3 in yeast ) ( see TABLE 1 for more details ) 141 , 142 . Only the complete TFIIH is transcription - competent , whereas the kinase module is not required for DNA repair 143 , 144 . Three TFIIH subunits have catalytic activity . XPB and XPD and their yeast homologues are ATPases 145 , 146 . Mutations in the genes encoding XPB and XPD are associated with the human diseases xeroderma pigmen - tosum , trichothiodystrophy and Cockayne syndrome 119 . Ssl2 and Rad3 possess helicase activity and exhibit 3ʹ – 5ʹ and 5ʹ – 3ʹ directionality , respectively 147 . XPB activity is required for promoter opening in vitro 116 , 148 and in vivo 149 , whereas the helicase function of XPD is required for DNA opening in the repair pathway 150 . CDK7 is a kinase that targets the C - terminal domain of Pol II 151 – 153 . The kinase module alone is catalytically active but must be located within TFIIH to be specific for the Pol II C - terminal domain 154 , 155 . Although C - terminal domain phosphoryla - tion accompanies transcription in vivo , CDK7 activity is not required for the initiation of transcription in vitro 156 . Structures are available for many TFIIH subunits , including CDK7 ( REF . 157 ) and cyclin H 158 , 159 , a domain of MAT1 ( REF . 160 ) , and for archaeal homologues of XPB 161 and XPD 162 ( see Supplementary information S1 ( table ) ) . The overall architecture of TFIIH was revealed by EM analysis 142 , 163 , 164 . Structural information on the position of TFIIH within the PIC suggested mechanisms for how TFIIH opens promoter DNA ( FIG . 3b ) . Protein – DNA crosslinking mapped TFIIH in the human PIC in the presence and absence of ATP 34 . This suggested that TFIIH acts as a molecular ‘wrench’ that rotates DNA with respect to a fixed upstream promoter complex at the TATA box , thereby creating torque and melting DNA 34 . As XPB was located on DNA downstream of the TATA box and did not bind to the transcription bubble , TFIIH apparently does not function as a conventional helicase , which would bind to the unwound region . Mutational analysis of XPB supported the view that DNA opening does not rely on helicase activity 165 . Structural models for TFIIH function . Protein crosslinking in the yeast system indicated that Ssl2 functions as an ATP - dependent , double - stranded DNA translocase 8 . Translocase action on downstream DNA was suggested to lead to the threading of DNA into the Pol II cleft . The translocase model is consistent with structural studies of a SWI / SNF - type ATPase 166 and with models of closed and open promoter com - plexes 10 . It is further consistent with the positioning of Ssl2 near TFIIE and DNA downstream of the TSS 29 , 167 . Trapping of melted DNA in the Pol II cleft may be a key function of TFIIE , because DNA loading into the cleft seems to be reversible 168 . A recent EM reconstruction of a TFIIH - containing PIC revealed a distinct density of TFIIH , with two con - tact points to the remainder of the PIC , one near TFIIE and one near downstream DNA 9 . This is consistent with a contact of the TFIIH core to TFIIE 169 . Compared with the position of Ssl2 derived in the yeast crosslinking study 8 , XPB was located approximately 10 bp further down - stream , and it was suggested that XPB ‘walks’ on the DNA away from the PIC , causing straining that facilitates DNA melting . Although the EM work did not reveal the TFIIH kinase module , comparison with a reconstruction of TFIIH alone indicated that it would be located close to the C - terminal domain linker and TFIIE 9 , which is con - sistent with the stimulation of C - terminal domain phos - phorylation by TFIIE 124 .

TFIID and promoter specificity TFIID is a conserved , multifunctional general tran - scription factor involved in promoter recognition , PIC assembly and chromatin remodelling ( reviewed in REFS 170 , 171 ) . TFIID is composed of TBP and 13 – 14 TAFs , with a total size of approximately 1 . 2 MDa . In addition to TBP and the 13 canonical TAFs that are conserved from yeast to humans 172 , metazoan genomes encode several cell type - specific variants of TBP and TAFs that form alternative TFIID complexes that are required for the expression of subsets of genes 173 – 176 . Experiments in yeast have indicated that TFIID contributes to the expres - sion of most Pol II - transcribed genes 177 . At metazoan pro - moters , diversity in TFIID complex composition depends on the developmenta l stage and cell type 178 , 179 . TFIID and promoter recognition . TFIID is involved in the recognition of core promoter sequences ( FIG . 4a ) . It was originally thought that TFIID was recruited to Pol II promoters through the TATA - binding activity of TBP . A conserved TATA box is , however , found only in 10 – 20 % of yeast and human promoters 180 . Analysis of core promoter sequences led to the identification of several additional core promoter elements that are rec - ognized by TAFs ( reviewed in REFS 181 , 182 ) . The initia - tor element , which is found in yeast and metazoans 180 , 183 , overlaps with the TSS and can be recognized by TAF1 – TAF2 ( REF . 184 ) . The motif ten element ( MTE ) 185 and the downstream promoter element ( DPE ) 186 were discovered in Drosophila melanogaster and later also identified in human promoters 63 . Both elements are probably rec - ognized by TAF6 – TAF9 ( REFS 187 , 188 ) . An additional overlapping promoter element , the downstream core element ( DCE ) , was identified in human promoters 189 and may be contacted by TAF1 ( REF . 190 ) . TFIID also Figure 4 | TFIID and promoter specificity . a | Some DNA elements in core promoters from yeast ( top ) and Drosophila and humans ( bottom ) are depicted , and elements known to contact TFIID are shown . b | Superimposition of DNA complex structures shows that the TAF1 ( a TATA box - binding protein ( TBP ) - associated factor ) regions TAND1 ( TAF1 N - terminal domain 1 ) and TAND2 would clash with TATA DNA and TFIIA , respectively 195 – 198 . Thus , binding of TBP to this region of TAF1 and DNA – TFIIA is mutually exclusive .

All rights reserved binds to activating transcription factors 191 , 192 , which help to recruit TFIID to promoters and may facilitate enhancer – promoter interactions . TFIID is also able to modulate TBP activity . The N - terminal domain of TAF1 binds to TBP and inhib - its its binding to TATA DNA 193 . The TAF1 N terminus contains two conserved subdomains , TAF1 N - terminal domain 1 ( TAND1 ) and TAND2 , which interact with TBP 194 . TAND1 binds to the DNA - binding surface of TBP in a way that mimics TATA DNA , whereas TAND2 binds to the convex surface of TBP competitively with TFIIA 195 – 198 ( FIG . 4b ) . Binding of TFIIA displaces the inhibitory TAF1 domain and stabilizes the TBP – pro - moter interaction 199 . In this way , TFIID is able to fine - tune DNA binding to promoters containing different combinations of binding elements . Structural studies of TFIID . Crystallographic studies of TAF subunits and EM studies of large TFIID com - plexes have been conducted . Early analysis of TAF subunits revealed the presence of several histone fold domains 200 , 201 . This , in conjunction with biochemi - cal and crystallographic studies , led to the proposal of a histone octamer - like core for TFIID 202 – 204 . Early EM studies of complete human and yeast TFIID complexes revealed a conserved three - lobed , horseshoe - like struc - ture of TFIID 205 – 207 . Studies of endogenous TFIID with additional factors provided the initial information on the overall organization of promoter - bound TFIID ( FIG . 4c ) . TFIID purified from Saccharomyces pombe , Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Homo sapiens has been investigated in complexes with promoter DNA 191 , 208 , 209 . In an investigation of yeast TFIID in a complex with TFIIA , DNA and the activator Rap1 , activator - dependen t DNA looping was observed 191 . In a study of human TFIID in a complex with TFIIA and a ration - ally designed DNA construct that combined various promoter elements 210 , the largest continuous promoter DNA density bound to TFIID was obtained 208 . Low amounts of an intact complex coupled with the large size and flexibility of endogenously purified TFIID have made structural studies of holo - TFIID challenging , and EM reconstructions of TFIID have generally been at resolutions that are too low for crystal structures to be fit unambiguously . A step towards overcoming this prob - lem was taken in a recent study in which a core com - plex of human TFIID , comprising approximately 50 % of the mass of TFIID , was expressed recombinantly 211 . A more rigid TFIID core with two - fold symmetry could be resolved at 12 Å resolution , and most densities were explained using known structures ( FIG . 4d ) . A highly intertwined architecture containing many protrusions and a large surface area was revealed . In the core TFIID structure , histone folds enabled TAF – TAF interactions but histone octamer geometry was not observed . The symmetry of the core TFIID complex was broken upon addition of TAF8 and TAF10 , which would enable the remaining TAFs to assemble along the periphery . Conclusions and perspectives The initiation of transcription at Pol II promoters is a very complex process in which dozens of polypeptides cooperate to recognize and open promoter DNA , locate the TSS and initiate pre - mRNA synthesis . Because of its large size and transient nature , the study of the Pol II ini - tiation complex will continue to be a challenge for struc - tural biologists . The first decade of work , which started in the 1990s , provided structures for many of the factors involved and several of their DNA complexes . The sec - ond decade of research provided structural information on Pol II complexes and led to models for how general transcription factors function . Over the next decade , we hope that a combination of structural biology methods will resolve many remaining questions on transcription initiation , and elucidate the mechanism of promoter opening and initial RNA synthesis , the remodelling of the transient protein – DNA interactions occurring at various stages of initiation , and the conformational changes underlying the allosteric activation of initia - tion and the transition from initiation to elongation . Important next steps include more detailed structural characterizations of TFIIH and the 25 - subunit coactiva - tor complex Mediator , not only in their free forms but also as parts of initiation complexes . 1 .
