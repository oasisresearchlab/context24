It is widely assumed that mechanisms of enhancer action involve reorganization of three - dimensional chromatin architecture , but this is poorly understood . Here we identify a novel mechanism of long - range enhancer associated chromatin reorganization . At the Sonic hedgehog ( Shh ) locus we observe large - scale decompaction of chromatin between Shh and its brain enhancers in neural progenitor cells . We show that the chromatin unfolding is dependent on activation of the enhancers , not the promoter , is impeded by chromatin - bound proteins located between the enhancer and promoter , and is mediated by the recruitment of Poly ( ADP - Ribose ) Polymerase 1 . We suggest that large - scale chromatin decompaction , analogous to the inducible puffs in Drosophila polytene chromosomes , represents a new mechanism of chromatin reorganization coupled to long - range gene activation from mammalian enhancers and that seems incompatible with a chromatin - looping model of enhancer - promoter communication Keywords chromatin compaction , chromosome puff , enhancer , PARP , poly ( ADP - ribosyl ) ation , sonic hedgehog , Tal - effector . .

Enhancers can operate when located proximal to , or very distant ( 100s to 1000s of kb ) from , their target gene ( Vernimmen and Bickmore , 2015 ) . Well established molecular signatures of functional enhancers include ; clustered sequence - specific transcription factor binding sites and DNaseI hypersensitive sites ( DHS ) , specific histone modifications e . g . H3K4me1 and acetylation of specific lysine residues on histone H3 ( H3K27ac , H3K64ac , H3K122ac ) and H4 ( H4K16ac ) and , in some cases , eRNA transcription ( Kim et al . , 2010 ; Pradeepa et al . , 2016 ; Shlyueva et al . , 2014 ; Taylor et al . , 2013 ) . However , less is known about the mechanisms by which enhancers communicate with , and control the expression of , their target gene promoter ( s ) . For proximal enhancers , it has been proposed that activation signals nucleated by bound transcription factors ( TFs ) then spread or move towards the target gene , by reorganising or modifying the intervening chromatin ( Benabdallah and Bickmore , 2015 ; Engel et al . , 2008 ; Hatzis and Talianidis , 2002 ; Wang et al . , 2005 ; Zhao and Dean , 2004 ; Zhu et al . , 2007 ) . These ‘tracking’ or ‘facilitated - tracking’ models are compatible with enhancers located in the vicinity of their target promoter , but have been considered unlikely as a mechanism for more distal enhancers . For very long - range regulation , direct communication between the enhancer and the promoter is thought to occur through interaction of protein complexes bound at both sites , with looping - out of the intervening chromatin . Chromatin ‘looping’ has best been illustrated for interactions between the β - globin gene and its locus control region ( LCR ) : enhancer - promoter interactions have been detected by chromosome conformation capture ( 3C ) methods ( Carter et al . , 2002 ; Tolhuis et al . , 2002 ) and experimentally forced enhancer - promoter chromatin looping contributes to transcriptional activation ( Bartman et al . , 2016 ; Deng et al . , 2012 , Deng et al . , 2014 ) . Fluorescence in situ hybridisation ( FISH ) has also been used to visualise the spatial juxtaposition of a target gene ( Shh ) with its distant ( 1Mb ) limb enhancer , with a looping - out of the intervening chromatin , specifically in Shh expressing tissues of the developing limb bud ( Williamson et al . , 2016 ) . A general compaction of the chromatin fibre between enhancer and promoter , rather than a discrete loop , has also been suggested ( Williamson et al . , 2012 , 2014 ) and this may facilitate factors recruited at enhancers finding their promoter - proximal binding sites through diffusional mechanisms ( Benabdallah and Bickmore , 2015 ) . However , to date , no other specific chromatin conformation has been demonstrated to contribute to long - range gene regulation from enhancers . The sonic hedgehog morphogen ( Shh ) governs the growth and patterning of many tissues during development . The precise spatial and temporal control of Shh expression is regulated by tissue - specific enhancers located ; within the introns of the gene , upstream of the Shh transcription start site .

Shh expression is important for several aspects of brain development . Shh - Brain - Enhancers - 5 ( SBE5 ) , SBE2 / 3 , SBE4 and SBE6 have been demonstrated to drive expression in the midbrain and anterior domains of the developing brain and are located 780 , 450 , 350 and 100 kb upstream of the Shh TSS , respectively ( Jeong , 2006 ; Benabdallah et al . , 2016 ; Yao et al . , 2016 ) . As distal enhancers , the SBE elements might be expected to loop into spatial proximity of Shh during its activation in neural progenitors cells ( NPCs ) . However , here we show that induction of Shh expression in NPCs , or by synthetic enhancer activation in mouse embryonic stem cells ( ESCs ) does not lead to detectable co - localisation between Shh and SBE6 , SBE4 , or SBE2 / 3 . Rather , we show that enhancer activation leads to an unfolding of chromatin between Shh and SBE4 / SBE6 that appears to be mediated by the recruitment and activity of Poly ( ADP - Ribose ) Polymerase 1 . .

Efficient differentiation was monitored through Sox1 - GFP fluorescence ( Benabdallah et al . , 2016 ) . As the known Shh - Brain - Enhancers SBE5 , SBE2 / 3 , SBE4 and SBE6 are located 780 , 450 , 350 and 100 kb upstream of Shh , respectively ( Figure 1A ) , the favoured mechanism by which these enhancers control Shh would involve a physical looping between them and the Shh promoter . To test this we used super - resolution microscopy , in conjunction with 3D fluorescence in situ hybridisation ( 3D - FISH ) , to visualise the spatial proximity of the enhancers and Shh before and after neural differentiation ( Williamson et al . , 2016 ) . The squared distances between two FISH probes typically have a linear relationship to the genomic distance that separates them ( Gilbert et al . , 2004 ; van den Engh et al . , 1992 ) , but is also influenced by chromatin folding ( Eskeland et al . , 2010 ; Williamson et al . , 2014 ) . Consistent with enhancer - promoter chromosome looping , we have previously demonstrated that spatial juxtaposition of Shh and it ZRS limb enhancer , with displacement of an intervening genomic region , is restricted to the time and place of Shh expression in the developing limb ( Williamson et al . , 2016 ) . If chromosome looping also occurs between the brain enhancers and Shh upon neuronal activation we anticipated that hybridisation signals for the SBE distal enhancers would display a higher frequency of co - localisation with Shh ( inter - probe distances ≤ 0 . 2 µ m ) , and shorter average inter - probe distances , in NPCs as compared with undifferentiated ESCs . We performed 3D FISH on 46c ESCs that do not express Shh , and on NPCs obtained after seven days of differentiation , when Shh is expressed ( Benabdallah et al . , 2016 ) and we imaged the slides by 3D - Structured Illumination Microscopy ( 3D - SIM ) . Surprisingly , upon Shh activation there was a significant increase in inter - probe distances between Shh and both the SBE6 and SBE4 , located 100 and 350 kb 5’ of Shh respectively ( Figures 1B and 1C ) . Inter - probe distances between Shh and the more distant SBE2 / 3 or ZRS were not significantly changed , nor were those to a control probe ( CTRL ) located 340kb downstream of Shh and not within the Shh regulatory region ( Figures 1A and 1B , Table S1 ) . This suggests that a large - scale chromatin unfolding occurs upon Shh neural induction and that this is limited to the region 300kb 5’ of the Shh TSS . It is noteworthy that , within this 300kb region , the most prominent peaks of H3K3me1 and H3K27ac gained during this NPC differentiation programme occur at SBE6 , and that SBE6 is required for full induction of Shh during this differentiation programme ( Benabdallah et al . , 2016 ) . .

To assess if ‘looping’ occurs at an earlier time point , we analyzed Shh expression at earlier stages during the NPC differentiation time course ( days 3 to 7 ) . Shh expression initiated on day 3 ( D3 ) and increased steadily until D6 or D7 ( Figure 1D ) . In all replicate experiments , Shh - SBE6 nuclear distances were significantly increased from D4 onwards ( Figure 1E ) . Though Shh - SBE6 distances were somewhat increased at D3 this did not reach statistical significance in this experiment , but in other replicates , there was a significant Shh - SBE6 distance increase by D3 ( Figure S1A ) . These data support the notion that no stable chromatin loop structures exist between SBE6 and Shh throughout this neural differentiation programme ( Table S1 ) . To determine whether Shh activation is coupled with the observed increased promoter - enhancer separation across the cell population , or whether there is a sub - population of NPCs that express Shh at high levels with a looped chromatin conformation ( short inter - probe distances ) that are obscured in the whole population , we performed single cell qRT - PCR on cells at D3 , D4 and D7 of NPC differentiation . These data show that in most cells of the population there is increased Shh expression at D3 and D4 , ( Figures 1F & S1B ) , and even higher levels of Shh expression by D7 , consistent with the cell population averaged expression data ( Figure 1D ) . For the same cell populations , Shh - SBE6 inter - probe distances start to increase at D3 and shift homogenously towards greater distances at D4 and D7 ( Figures 1G ) , mirroring the population wide increase in Shh expression . Across this time course , there was a corresponding decrease in the frequency of alleles with Shh - SBE6 inter - probe distances ( ≤ 200nm ) that we would consider compatible with enhancer - promoter juxtaposition ( Figures 1G and S1C ) ( Williamson et al . , 2016 ) . To show that 3D FISH analysis is capable of detecting a chromosome loop in ESCs , we created an artificial Shh - SBE interaction . Targeted tethering ( using zinc fingers ) of the self - association domain ( SA ) of LIM domain - binding protein 1 ( LDB1 ) has been used previously to force a chromatin loop at the β - globin locus ( Bartman et al . , 2016 ; Deng et al . , 2012 , 2014 ) . Using a similar approach , but employing transcription activator - like effector ( Tale ) proteins to direct site - specific binding ( Therizols et al . , 2014 ) , we tethered the LBD1 SA to the Shh promoter ( tShh - LDB1 ) and to either SBE6 or SBE2 ( tSBE6 - LDB1 and tSBE2 - LDB1 ) in ESCs ( Figure S1D ) . 3D FISH revealed dramatically increased enhancer - promoter co - localization ( ≤ 200nm ) upon tShh - LDB1 and tSBE6 / tSBE2 - LDB1 co - transfection ( Figure S1E and S1F ) . Four - color 3D - FISH , confirmed that a chromatin conformation consistent with a loop , and not simply chromatin compaction , was formed upon Tale - LDB1 expression ( Figures S1G and H & Table S2 ) . We conclude that 3D FISH is able to detect a chromatin loop in ESCs , albeit an artificially constructed one . .

FISH showed that the increased Shh - SBE6 inter - probe distances are abolished in NPCs derived from SBE6 - / - ESCs ( Figure 2A ) . This demonstrates that chromatin unfolding across the 100kb 5’ of Shh during NPC differentiation is dependent on SBE6 . Mouse transgenic assays indicate that SBE6 is active in brain development and in the neural tube ( Benabdallah et al . , 2016 ) . Shh is expressed specifically in ventral regions of the neural tube – in the floorplate and notochord ( Jeong et al . , 2006 ) ( Figure 2B ) and SBE6 drives floorplate expression in a reporter assay . To assess if chromatin unfolding occurs in vivo , we used FISH to examine Shh - SBE6 inter - probe distances in sections through the neural tube of an E10 . 5 embryo . Shh - SBE6 distances were greater in nuclei from the floorplate region than in dorsal neural tube cells ( Figure 2C ) , suggesting that our ex vivo analysis reflects a long - range chromatin reorganisation 5’ of Shh that also occurs in vivo during neurogenesis . To determine if other , as yet unidentified , cis - regulatory elements interact with the Shh promoter during the differentiation of ESCs to NPCs , we used Chromosome Conformation Capture Carbon Copy ( 5C ) to assay cross - linked ligation frequencies across the Shh regulatory domain . Consistent with published Hi - C data from ESCs ( Smallwood and Ren , 2013 ) , and 5C data from E11 . 5 embryos ( Williamson et al . , 2016 ) , 5C revealed that in both ESCs and NPCs all of the SBEs are contained in a topologically associated domain ( TAD ) that extends from downstream of Shh to downstream of Nom1 ( Figure S2A ) . Comparison of 5C data from ESCs and NPCs revealed no evidence for a gain of specific interactions in NPCs that might indicate the formation of a ‘loop’ between Shh and its neural enhancers ( Figures 2D & S2B ) . SBE , and not direct Shh promoter , activation promotes chromatin unfolding . Supercoiling associated with transcription is known to decondense large chromatin domains ( Matsumoto and Hirose , 2004 ; Naughton et al . , 2013 ) , therefore the chromatin unfolding we observe during NPC differentiation could occur as a passive consequence of Shh transcription . To determine if this is the case , or if chromatin unfolding depends on Shh Brain - Enhancer activation , we designed an enhancer bypass experiment , fusing a Tal effector targeted to the Shh promoter ( tShh ) to four repeats of the small viral acidic protein Vp16 ( Vp64 ) that can strongly activate gene expression ( Zhang et al . , 2011 ) ( Figure 3A ) , including in ESCs ( Therizols et al . , 2014 ) . Expression of tShh - Vp64 in ESCs led to the activation of Shh expression to levels similar to those seen in differentiated NPCs ( Figure 3B ) , .

However , this synthetic activation of Shh in ESCs did not lead to the increased Shh - SBE6 inter - probe distances observed during NPC differentiation ( Figure 3C ) . Therefore , chromatin unfolding upstream of Shh is not simply a consequence of activating Shh expression . Recruiting Vp64 to SBE2 or SBE6 individually , or in combination , through tSBE6 - Vp64 and tSBE2 - Vp64 also induced Shh expression , albeit less marked compared to direct Vp64 recruitment to the Shh promoter ( Figure 3B ) . Shh activation by Tale - Vp64 recruitment to either SBE2 or SBE6 alone did not lead to increased Shh - SBE6 inter - probe distances ( Figure 3C and Table S3 ) . However , simultaneously co - activating SBE6 and SBE2 , by co - transfecting both tSBE6 - Vp64 and tSBE2 - Vp64 ( tSBE ( 6 + 2 ) - Vp64 ) , led to significant distance increases between Shh and SBE6 ( Figure 3C ) . This was specific to Vp64 activity as recruiting Tales without a fusion domain ( tSBE ( 6 + 2 ) - Δ ) had no effect ( Figure 3C ) . FISH between Shh and SBE2 confirmed that the chromatin unfolding was confined to the Shh - SBE6 region – even when the activator was recruited to SBE2 ( Figure S3B and Table S3 ) . To test whether the differential effect of single vs double Tal - Vp64 targeting was due simply to the local concentration of ‘activator’ that could be recruited , we targeted Vp128 ( 8 copies of Vp16 ) to the Shh promoter and to SBE6 and SBE2 individually ( Figure 3A ) . All three led to activation of Shh expression in ESCs ( Figure 3D ) , but chromatin unfolding was only observed when Vp128 was recruited to the enhancers and not to the Shh promoter . In contrast to the recruitment of Vp64 , Vp128 recruitment to either SBE6 or SBE2 alone was sufficient to induce this change in chromosome conformation ( Figure 3E ) . Therefore , the amount of activator recruited to the Shh regulatory region seems crucial to the induction of visible levels of chromatin unfolding . 5C analysis in ESCs following Tale - Vp64 transfection did not reveal any direct interactions established between the Shh promoter and another sequence 5’ of Shh when SBE6 and SBE2 are activated , either individually or together ( Figures 3F and S3C ) . Endogenous activators and co - activators also induce chromatin unfolding . Vp16 is a very effective transcriptional activator , but of viral origin . We therefore wished to analyse whether mammalian endogenous activators and co - activators could induce similar long - range chromatin changes across the genomic region 5’ of Shh . The Mediator co - activator is known to be recruited to active enhancers and promoters ( Allen and Taatjes , 2015 ; Yin et al . , 2014 ) and can work alongside cohesin to alter 3D chromosome conformation upon enhancer driven gene activation ( Kagey et al . , 2010 ; Visel et al . , 2009 ) . Chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) showed that Mediator is indeed recruited to the Shh promoter during the differentiation of 46c ESCs to NPCs ( Figure 4A ) . .

Amongst the transcriptional activators that interact with Mediator is Vp16 , which interacts with the Med25 subunit located in the tail domain of the complex ( Milbradt et al . , 2011 ; Vojnic et al . , 2011 ) . Med25 is recruited into the Mediator complex through its N - terminal Von Willebrand factor A ( VWA ) domain ( Mittler et al . , 2003 ) . We therefore fused Tales to the Med25 VWA domain ( Figure 4B ) . Compared to Tale - Vp16 fusions , Med25 - VWA recruitment induced only very low levels of Shh expression , even for the Shh promoter targeted Tale ( tShh - VWA ) ( Figure 4C ) . Nevertheless , when targeted to both SBE6 and SBE2 , Tale - VWA promotes significant chromatin unfolding between SBE6 and Shh ( Figure 4D and Table S4 ) . Moreover , this also results in the recruitment of the Med 12 subunit of the Mediator kinase module at the Shh promoter , compatible with a long - range effect ( Figure 4A ) . For the most part , the endogenous TFs that bind to SBEs to activate Shh in neural tissues are unknown . However , Six homeobox 3 ( SIX3 ) is known to bind to SBE2 , and mutation of its binding site , or of SIX3 itself , affects Shh expression in the developing brain leading to severe holoprosencephaly ( HPE ) ( Geng et al . , 2008 ; Jeong et al . , 2008 ) . Six3 is also significantly upregulated during the ex vivo differentiation of ESCs to NPCs ( Benabdallah et al . , 2016 ) . This prompted us to investigate whether SIX3 binding was sufficient to recapitulate chromatin unfolding in the region 5’ of Shh . Tale - directed recruitment of SIX3 to SBE2 in ESCs ( Figure 4E ) induced only very low level and variable Shh expression ( Figure 4F ) , but led to dramatic chromatin unfolding ( Figure 4G , Table S4 ) . Therefore recruitment of either an endogenous activator ( SIX3 ) or co - activator ( Mediator ) to the gene desert 5’ of Shh is capable of inducing an unfolding of long - range chromatin structure and this is not simply dependent on the induction of very high levels of Shh expression . Blocking of chromatin unfolding suggests a spreading - like mechanism . Chromatin unfolding ( increased nuclear distances between SBE6 / 2 and Shh ) , and the absence of detectable enhancer - promoter looping / spatial juxtaposition , is suggestive of a more linear spreading / linking or tracking - like mechanism operating in the region 5’ of Shh ( Bulger and Groudine , 1999 ; Engel et al . , 2008 ; Vernimmen and Bickmore , 2015 ) . To test this model , we attempted to insert obstacles between SBE6 and Shh which might block such a mechanism . To do this we chose a site 65kb upstream from the Shh TSS ( chr5 : 28859721 ; mm9 ) that lacked evidence of enhancer activity ( H3K4me1 / H3K27ac marks ) during ESC - NPC differentiation ( Benabdallh et al . , 2016 ) , and that does not show evolutionary conservation . We designed a Tale construct specific to this site ( called NE – for Non - Enhancer ) and fused it to CTCF ( tNE - CTCF ) ( Figure 5A ) . CTCF has been proposed to block an enhancer - promoter tracking mechanism at the H19 / Igf2 locus ( Engel et al . , 2008 ) and to have general enhancer blocking functions ( Burgess - Beusse et al . , 2002 ) .

Single cell qRT - PCR confirmed that the majority of the cells transfected with tNE - CTCF + tSBE ( 6 + 2 ) - Vp64 had very low levels of Shh expression ( Figure 5C ) . The binding of tNE - CTCF prevented Shh - SBE6 chromatin unfolding induced by the Tale - Vp64 co - activation of SBE6 and SBE2 ( Figure 5D and Table S5 ) consistent with the intervening CTCF molecule interrupting a spreading mechanism initiated at SBE6 / 2 . However , we found that the binding at NE of a Tale without any fused protein ( tNE - Δ ) had the same negative impact on Shh expression ( Figure 5B ) and Shh - SBE6 chromatin unfolding ( Figure 5E ) as tNE - CTCF . Chromatin unfolding induced by Tale - mediated recruitment of Med25 - VWA or SIX3 to SBE6 / 2 could be similarly blocked by co - transfection with tNE - CTCF or tNE - Δ ( Figures 5F and 5G ) . These data suggest that induced Shh - SBE6 chromatin unfolding occurred through a mechanism that is impeded by a protein bound strongly at an intervening site , and that this negatively impacts on Shh activation from a distance . Chromatin unfolding in the Shh regulatory domain involves poly ( ADP - ribosyl ) ation . Our data suggest that chromatin unfolding spreads within the region 5’ of Shh . Histone acetylation can lead to cytological levels of chromatin decompaction ( Toth et al . , 2004 ; Lleres et al . , 2009 ) and there are examples of histone acetylation spreading between an enhancer and target gene , and that is blocked by CTCF ( Zhao and Dean , 2004 ) . Shh activation using Tale - Vp64 constructs targeted to SBE6 or SBE2 did indeed induce histone acetylation ( H3K27ac ) but this was limited precisely to the Tale binding site – with no indication of spreading ( Figure S4 ) . Another post - translational chromatin modification that can induce large - scale chromatin unfolding in vitro and in vivo is poly ( ADP - ribosyl ) ation ( PARylation ) catalysed by poly ( ADP - ribose ) polymerases , including PARP1 ( Huletsky et al . , 1989 ) . Moreover , PARP1 and high levels of poly ( ADP - ribose ) have been linked with chromatin decompaction and gene activation at ecdysone and heat - shock induced puffs on Drosophila polytene chromosomes ( Tulin and Spradling , 2003 ; Sawatsubashi et al . , 2004 ) . We therefore investigated whether PARP1 recruitment could induce chromatin unfolding at the Shh region , by targeting PARP1 to Shh , SBE6 or SBE2 using Tales ( Figure 6A ) . PARP1 recruitment had a minimal affect on Shh expression ( Figure 6B ) , but led to chromatin unfolding between Shh and SBE6 when targeted to SBE6 or SBE2 ( Figure 6C and Table S6 ) . Recruitment of PARP1 to the Shh promoter had no detectable affect on chromatin unfolding in the region . Moreover , PARP1 mediated chromatin unfolding , that had been initiated from either SBE6 or SBE2 , could be blocked by co - transfection with tNE - CTCF ( Figure 6C ) . To assess if the chromatin unfolding seen by targeted recruitment of other activators – such as SIX3 ( Fig 5C ) – also involves PARP1 catalytic activity , we used the PARP inhibitor olaparib ( Shen et .

Olaparib treatment prevented chromatin unfolding mediated by either SIX3 or PARP1 recruitment to SBE2 ( tSBE2 - SIX3 or tSBE2 - PARP1 ) ( Figure 6D ) . Olaparib also prevented the Shh - SBE6 distance increases seen upon the differentiation of ESCs to NPCs ( Figure 6E and Table S6 ) . We have previously shown that large - scale chromatin unfolding can be induced by Tale - mediated recruitment of a small acidic peptide DELQPASIDP ( DEL ) which has been shown to decompact chromatin without leading to gene activation ( Carpenter et al . , 2005 ; Therizols et al . , 2014 ) . Targeting DEL to the Shh region ( Figure 6F ) also led to visible chromatin decompaction ( Figure 6G and H ) , but unlike our experiments tethering Vp16 , Mediator , or PARP1 , this was also seen when the DEL peptide was recruited directly to the Shh promoter ( Figure 6G ) . This result is similar to our previous studies in which the DEL peptide was recruited to the promoters of silent genes in ESCs ( Therizols et al . , 2014 ) . Also unlike the chromatin decompaction induced by PARP1 , transcriptional activators and co - activators , chromatin unfolding induced by the DEL peptide recruited to SBE2 was not blocked by tethering of an intervening CTCF ( Figure 6H and Table S6 ) , and it was not inhibited by olaparib ( Figure 6I ) . These data suggest that chromatin decompaction induced in the regulatory region 5’ of Shh , either during NPC differentiation or during synthetic activation , is quite distinct in its mechanism and its mode of propagation from that induced by the DEL peptide . To better understand the nature of the unfolded chromatin upstream of Shh , we performed 2D - FISH with a fosmid probe for Shh , and a BAC probe that spans the 171kb region from 50kb 5’ of Shh up until SBE4 ( Figure 7A ) – the limit of the chromatin unfolding detected during NPC differentiation ( Figure 1B ) . BAC probe hybridisation signals were classified as either compact point , or extended / ‘puffed’ signals . Relative to control ESCs , there was a significant increase in the proportion of puffed signals observed when either Vp16 or PARP1 was recruited to the Shh regulatory domain , and this was inhibited when PARP1 recruitment was conducted in the presence of olaparib ( Figure 7A and Table S7 ) . These data suggest that there is a decompaction of the entire chromatin region extending 200kb 5’ of Shh when either an activator ( Vp16 ) or PARP1 is recruited to this region , that requires the catalytic activity of PARP1 and that resembles the puffs seen on Drosophila polytene chromosomes . Two scenarios can be envisaged for how PARP1 activity and PARylation contribute to large - scale chromatin remodelling . PARylation , e . g . of a chromatin substrate , could lead directly to chromatin decompaction . Alternatively , hydrolysis of the ADP - ribose chains by poly ( ADP - ribose ) glycohydrolase ( PARG ) could be being used to generate ATP in the nucleus to support the activity of ATP - dependent chromatin remodelling enzymes ( Wright et al . , 2016 ) . To distinguish between these two mechanisms , we depleted PARG using siRNA mediated knocked - down ( Figure 7B ) . Relative to ESCs , chromatin decompaction in the Shh - SBE6 region , induced by recruitment of Vp16 , PARP1 or .

We conclude that most of the chromatin decompaction that we have detected as a result of recruitment of activators or PARP1 to the regulatory region 5’ of Shh relies on PARP1 but not on PARG activity and so is like due to the process of PARylation itself . .

Recent results using live - cell imaging in Drosophila melanogaster to study nascent transcription driven by enhancer elements have challenged the idea of stable enhancer - promoter loops as the basis for enhancer - promoter communication ( Fukaya et al . , 2016 ) . However , only a handful of enhancer - promoter interactions have been studied in detail and validated , and therefore the generality of a chromatin looping mechanism remains unclear . Here we have analysed the spatial relationship between Shh and its neural enhancers SBE6 , SBE4 and SBE2 / SBE3 using FISH and 5C during neural differentiation and , surprisingly , we identified a visible decompaction of the chromatin in the 350kb region between Shh and SBE4 , with no evidence for chromatin loops being formed between Shh and enhancers in this region . Chromatin unfolding is dependent on a regulatory element ( SBE6 ) , that we have previously shown becomes activated during NPC differentiation , and that in vivo has activity in the floor plate region of the neural tube – an important site of Shh expression ( Benabdallah et al . , 2016 ) . Consistent with these data , chromatin decompaction between Shh and SBE6 is detected in the floor plate , but not in the dorsal neural tube in mouse embryos . To dissect the mechanism leading to this chromatin decompaction , we used synthetic activators ( based upon Tale - mediated recruitment of Vp16 ) to either induce Shh expression directly through activator recruitment to the gene promoter , or to induce expression from a distance through recruitment to distal sites up to 400kb away in the Shh regulatory domain . Activation from a distance recapitulated the chromatin decompaction seen during NPC differentiation and this was not seen if activators , or co - activators were recruited directly to the Shh promoter , allowing us to exclude that large - scale chromatin decompaction is simply a consequence of Shh expression . Induction of chromatin decompaction was recapitulated using distal recruitment of an endogenous activator ( Six3 ) or co - activator ( Mediator ) . Chromatin decompaction seems most compatible with a tracking or linking mechanism of enhancer action ( Bulger and Groudine , 2011 ) . Indeed , we could block chromatin decompaction and abrogate Shh activation from a distance if a Tal effector protein was bound between Shh and the distal site of activator / coactivator recruitment . This was not generic to all forms of visible chromatin decompaction - for example that induced by recruitment of the DEL peptide ( Carpenter et al . , 2005 ; Therizols et al . , 2014 ) . Together , our results reveal a strong link between a distinct form of chromatin unfolding and robust Shh activation from a distance . .

PARylation has been shown to induce massive decompaction of nucleosome arrays in vitro ( Poirier et al . , 1982 ; Huletsky et al . , 1989 ) and in vivo ( Tulin and Spradling , 2003 ; Petesch and Lis , 2008 ) . Substrates for PARylation include the core histones , histone H1 and other proteins that can remodel and relax chromatin structure ( Gottschalk et al . , 2009 ; Petesch and Lis , 2008 ; Timinszky et al . , 2009 ; Ji and Tulin , 2010 ; Sellou et al . , 2016 ) . Though PARP1 is usually studied in the context of DNA damage sensing and repair , it has also been associated with the regulation of gene expression ( Ogino et al . , 2007 ) and with active chromatin and regions with regulatory potential as assayed by DNase I hypersensitivity ( Nalabothula et al . , 2015 ) . More specifically , PARP and Parp1 - dependent PARylation have been implicated in gene regulation from distal enhancer elements that are controlled by nuclear hormone receptors including ; ecdysone inducible puffs in Drosophila ( Sawatsubashi et al . , 2004 ) and the action of the liganded progesterone receptor in mammalian breast cancer cells ( Wright et al . , 2012 ) . The function of PARP1 and PARylation at regulatory elements might be directly to open chromatin structure to facilitate access of other factors involved in transcriptional activation . A second possibility is more linked to the role of PARP - 1 in DNA repair . There is growing evidence that DNA strand - breaks are important in transcriptional activation . Topoisomerase IIb dependent double - strand break formation , and the subsequent recruitment of Parp - 1 activity , is required for signal - induced transcriptional gene activation ( Ju et al . , 2006 ) . Single - strand nicks generated by topoisomerase I might also be important ( Puc et al . , 2016 ) . Recruitment of PARP - 1 might be through DNA breaks per se , through interaction with transcription factors or co - activator complexes , or through altered DNA structures associated with the activation of transcription ( Lonskaya et al . , 2005 ) . Finally , the importance of PARylation might be not simply be in decondensing higher - order chromatin structures , but instead the nucleic - acid like PAR chains may seed a phase separation state through liquid de - mixing ( Altemeyer et al . , 2015 ) that then organizes an enhancer - centred nuclear compartment that can concentrate or exclude other proteins and orchestrate the multi - step reactions linked to robust transcriptional activation ( Hnisz et al . , 2017 ) . Further experimentation will be required to investigate these possibilities . . CC - BY - NC - ND 4 . 0 International license not peer - reviewed ) is the author / funder .

Single Cell RT - qPCR RNA reverse transcription and cDNA pre - amplification from single cells were performed as previously described ( Dalerba et al . , 2011 ) with some modifications . Each well of a 96 - well PCR plate was loaded with 5 µ l 2x Reaction Mix , 0 . 2 µ l Superscript III RT / Platinum Taq Mix with RNaseOUT Ribonuclease Inhibitor ( Invitrogen Cells Direct One - Step qRT - PCR kit , Life Technologies ) , 2 . 5 µ l primer mix ( containing 200 nM of each gene - specific primer ) , 1 . 3 µ l H 2 O . Single - cell suspensions from NPC differentiation or transfection were sorted on their GFP reporter into separate wells of the 96 - well PCR plate . 32 cells were sorted into one well , to be used for serial dilution for generation of qRT - PCR standard curves . RNA reverse transcription and 22 cycles of cDNA pre - amplification were performed as previously described ( Dalerba et al . , 2011 ) . The cDNA was diluted 1 : 5 in H 2 O and qRT - PCR performed as above using 9 µ l of this diluted cDNA . TALE Design & Assembly Tales were designed using TAL Effector Nucleotide Targeter 2 . 0 software ( Doyle et al . , 2012 ) and the assembly was performed following the protocol described in ( Therizols et al . , 2014 ) . Briefly , TALE DNA binding domains specific to the Shh promoter , SBE6 , SBE2 , and NE were assembled following the methods described in ( Ding et al . , 2013 ) . DNA binding domains specific for 16 nucleotide sequences were generated by the modular assembly of 4 pre - assembled multimeric TALE repeat modules ( three 4 - mer and one 3 - mer ) into a modified TALEN backbone in which the BamHI - BsrGI .

The BamHI - BglII fragment containing Vp64 of the Tale - Vp64 plasmid was deleted to generate Tale - ∆ . To generate other Tal - fusions , the BamHI - NheI cloning site was further used to fuse the Tale with ; the SA domain of LDB1 from gBlocks® ( IDT ) , with CTCF , Six3 or PARP1 from GeneArt® ( Life Technologies ) . To generate Tale - BP , the BamHI - NheI fragment containing Vp64 was replaced by a double strand oligonucleotide encoding the DELQPASIDP peptide ( Carpenter et al . , 2005 ; Therizols et al . , 2014 ) . Chromatin Immunoprecipitation and Microarray processing For cross - link ChIP , 0 . 5 - 1x10 7 ESC were first cross - linked with EGS ( Pearce , Thermo Scientific , product no . 21565 ) in PBS at a final concentration of 2 mM for 60 min at r . t . Formaldehyde was then added at a final concentration of 1 % methanol - free formaldehyde ( Thermo Scientific Pierce PN28906 ) and incubated at r . t . for 10 min followed by 5 min incubation with 125mM glycine and then washed in PBS . All buffers were supplemented with the following additives just prior to use : 0 . 2 mM PMSF , 1 mM DTT , 1x Protease inhibitors ( Calbiochem , 539134 - 1SET ) and 1x phosphatase inhibitors ( Roche , PhosSTOP , 04906837001 ) . Purified DNA was isolated using a QIAquick PCR Purification Kit ( Qiagen ) . Med12 ChIP was performed as previously described ( Vernimmen et al . , 2007 ) using Med12 antibody ( Bethyl laboratories , A300 - 774A ) and quantitative ( q ) PCR was performed on a LightCycler480 ( Roche ) using the same guideline as for qRT - PCR . ChIP qPCR primers are displayed in Table S10 . For examination of histone acetylation by native ChIP , nuclei were prepared and resuspended in NB - R as previously described ( Gilbert et al . , 2003 ) . Nuclei corresponding to 0 . 5 - 1x10 7 ESCs were digested with 50 - 80 Boehringer units of MNase ( Sigma ) for 10 min at r . t . in the presence of 20 µg RNase A to obtain a chromatin ladder enriched in tri - , tetra - , and some pentanucleosomes . The reaction was stopped by adding equal volume of Stop Buffer ( 215 mM NaCl , 10 mM TrisHCl pH 8 , 20 mM EDTA , 5 . 5 % Sucrose , 2 % Triton X - 100 , 0 . 2 mM PMSF 1 mM DTT and complete protease inhibitor cocktail ) and incubated on ice overnight . Between 50 - 150 µg released chromatin were pre - cleared with Protein G Sepharose ( GE Healthcare ) for 2 hr and mixed with 10 µg prebound H3K27ac antibody ( Millipore 07 - 360 ) in the presence of 100 µg BSA and incubated for 3 hr at 4 °C . Beads were then washed 3x with Wash Buffer ( 150 mM NaCl , 10 mM TrisHCl pH 8 , 2 mM EDTA , 1 % NP40 , 1 % Sodium deoxycholate , 0 . 2mM PMSF , 1mM DTT and protease inhibitor cocktail ) and once in TE . Bound complexes were eluted with 0 . 1 M NaHCO3 , 1 % SDS at r . t . Immunoprecipitated and input DNA were purified with Proteinase K ( Genaxxon ) and Qiagen PCR purification kit . .

Amplified material was labelled with Cy3 or Cy5 by random priming according to the NimbleGen ChIP - chip protocol ( Roche ) . Samples were hybridized for 20 h and washed according to manufacturer´s protocol . A custom 3x720K mouse tiling array ( NimbleGen , Roche ) containing 179 , 493 unique probes from different genomic regions , with each probe represented by 4 replicates was used . Arrays were scanned on a NimbleGen MS 200 Microarray scanner ( Roche ) using 100 % laser power and 2 µ m resolution . Raw signal intensities were quantified from TIFF images using MS 200 Data Collection software . ChIP microarray data were analysed in R using the bioconductor packages Beadarray and Limma according to the Epigenesys NimbleGen ChIP - on - chip protocol 43 . Scale normalization was used within replicates , to control inter - array variability . Enrichment scores are defined as log2 ChIP / Input signal . 5C primer , 5C library design and preparation 3C library preparation was performed as previously described ( Williamson et al . , 2014 ) . 1 x 10 7 ESCs or NPCs were fixed with 1 % formaldehyde for 10 min at r . t . Cross - linking was stopped with 125 mM glycine for 5 min at r . t . followed by 15 min on ice . Cells were centrifuged at 400 g for 10 min at 4°C , supernatants were removed , and cell pellets were flash - frozen on dry ice . Cell pellets were then treated as previously described ( Dostie and Dekker , 2007 ; Ferraiuolo et al . , 2010 ; Williamson et al . 2016 ) . Briefly , 1 - 2 x 10 7 fixed cells were incubated for 15 min on ice in 200 µl of lysis buffer ( 10 mM Tris at pH 8 . 0 , 10 mM NaCl , 0 . 2 % NP40 , supplemented with fresh protease inhibitor cocktail ) . Cells were then disrupted on ice with a dounce homogenizer ( pestle B ; 2 × 20 strokes ) ; cell suspensions were transferred to Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged at 2000 g for 5 min . Supernatants were removed , the cell pellets were washed twice with 100 µl of 1 × CutSmart buffer ( New England Biolabs ) , and the cell pellet was resuspended in 100 µl of 1 × CutSmart buffer and divided into two Eppendorf tubes . 1 × CutSmart buffer ( 337 µL ) was added to each tube , and the mixture was incubated for 10 min at 65°C with 0 . 1 % SDS . Forty - four microliters of 10 % Triton X - 100 were added before overnight digestion with 400 U of HindIII . The restriction enzyme was then inactivated by adding 86 µl 10 % SDS and incubation for 30 min at 65°C . Samples were then individually diluted into 7 . 62 ml of ligation mix ( 750 µl 10 % Triton X - 100 , 750 µl 10 × ligation buffer , 80 µl 10 mg / ml of BSA , 80 µl 100 mM ATP , 3000 cohesive end units of T4 DNA ligase ) and incubated for 2 h at 16°C . 3C libraries were incubated overnight at 65°C with 50 µl of Proteinase K ( 10 mg / ml ) and an additional 50 µl of Proteinase K the following day for 2 h .

After at least 1 h at − 80°C , the DNA was centrifuged at 20 , 000 g for 25 min at 4°C , and the pellets were washed with cold 70 % EtOH . DNA was resuspended in 400 µl of TE ( pH 8 . 0 ) and transferred to Eppendorf tubes for another phenol – chloroform extraction and precipitation with 40 µl of 3 M NaOAc ( pH 5 . 2 ) and 1 . 1 ml of cold EtOH . DNA was recovered by centrifugation and washed eight times with cold 70 % EtOH . Pellets were then dissolved in 100 µl of TE ( pH 8 . 0 ) and incubated with1 µl of 10 mg / ml RNase A for 15 min at 37°C . 5C primers covering the USP22 ( mm9 , chr11 : 60 , 917 , 307 – 61 , 017 , 307 ) and Shh ( mm9 , chr5 : 28317087 - 30005000 ) regions , library design , and preparation , were performed as described ( Williamson et al . 2016 ) . 5C libraries were prepared and amplified with the A - key and P1 - key primers as described previously ( Fraser et al . , 2012 ) . 3C libraries were first titrated by PCR for quality control ( single band , absence of primer dimers , etc . ) and to verify that contacts were amplified at frequencies similar to that usually obtained from comparable libraries ( same DNA amount from the same species and karyotype ) ( Dostie and Dekker , 2007 ; Fraser et al . , 2010 ) . We used 1 – 11 µg of 3C library per 5C ligation reaction . 5C primer stocks ( 20 µM ) were diluted individually in water on ice and mixed to a final concentration of 0 . 002 µM . Mixed diluted primers ( 1 . 7 µl ) were combined with 1 µl of annealing buffer ( 10 × NEBuffer 4 , New England Biolabs ) on ice in reaction tubes . Salmon testis DNA ( 1 . 5 µg ) was added to each tube , followed by the 3C libraries and water to a final volume of 10 µl . Samples were denatured for 5 min at 95°C and annealed for 16 h at 48°C . Ligation with 10 U of Taq DNA ligase was performed for 1 h at 48°C . One - tenth ( 3 µl ) of each ligation was then PCR - amplified individually with primers against the A - key and P1 - key primer tails . We used 26 or 28 cycles based on dilution series showing linear PCR amplification within that cycle range . The products from two to four PCR reactions were pooled before purifying the DNA on MinElute columns ( Qiagen ) . 5C libraries were quantified on agarose gels and diluted to 0 . 0534 ng / µL ( for Xpress template kit version 2 . 0 ) or 12 pmol ( for Ion Proton ) . One microliter of diluted 5C library was used for sequencing with an Ion Proton sequencer . Samples were sequenced as recommended by the manufacturer ( Life Technologies ) . Analysis of the 5C sequencing data was performed as described earlier ( Berlivet et al . , 2013 ) . The sequencing data were processed through a Torrent 5C data transformation pipeline on Galaxy ( https : / / main . g2 . bx . psu . edu ) . Data were normalized by dividing the number of reads of each 5C contact by the total number of reads from the corresponding sequence run . All scales shown correspond to this ratio multiplied by 10 3 . Sequencing technical and biological replicates reads are displayed in Table S11 . .
