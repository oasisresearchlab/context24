HEMOSTASIS , THROMBOSIS , AND VASCULAR BIOLOGY Cdc42 / Rac1 - dependent activation of the p21 - activated kinase ( PAK ) regulates human platelet lamellipodia spreading : implication of the cortical - actin binding protein cortactin Catherine Vidal , Blandine Geny , Josiane Melle , Martine Jandrot - Perrus , and Michae¨la Fontenay - Roupie Platelet activation by thrombin or throm - bin receptor - activating peptide ( TRAP ) re - sults in extensive actin reorganization that leads to ﬁlopodia emission and lamel - lae spreading concomitantly with activa - tion of the Rho family small G proteins , Cdc42 and Rac1 . Evidence has been pro - vided that direct binding of Cdc42 - guanosine triphosphate ( GTP ) and Rac1 - GTP to the N - terminal regulatory domain of the p21 - activated kinase ( PAK ) stimu - lates PAK activation and actin reorganiza - tion . In the present study , we have investi - gated the relationship between shape change and PAK activation . We show that thrombin , TRAP , or monoclonal antibody ( MoAb ) anti - Fc (cid:1) RIIA IV . 3 induces an acti - vation of Cdc42 and Rac1 . The GpVI li - gand , convulxin ( CVX ) , that forces plate - lets to lamellae spreading efﬁciently activates Rac1 . Thrombin , TRAP , MoAb IV . 3 , and CVX stimulate autophosphoryla - tion and kinase activity of PAK . Inhibition of Cdc42 and Rac1 with clostridial toxin B inhibits PAK activation and lamellae spreading . The cortical - actin binding pro - tein , p80 / 85 cortactin , is constitutively associated with PAK in resting platelets and dissociates from PAK after thrombin stimulation . Inhibition of PAK autophos - phorylation by toxin B prevents the disso - ciation of cortactin . These results suggest that Cdc42 / Rac1 - dependent activation of PAKmaytriggerearlyplateletshapechange , at least in part through the regulation of cortactin binding to PAK . ( Blood . 2002 ; 100 : 4462 - 4469 ) © 2002 by TheAmerican Society of Hematology Introduction The actin cytoskeleton plays an important role in deﬁning cell shape and morphology . Actin - rich ﬁlopodia and lamellipodia protrusions are thought to depend on the activation of small guanosine triphosphatases ( GTPases ) of the Rho subfamily , Cdc42 and Rac1 , respectively . 1 , 2 In platelets , stimulation by thrombin induces ﬁlopodia extension and lamellae spreading supported by massive actin polymerization . Subsequently to early shape change , platelets reorganize adhesion points mainly focused on integrin (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 with emergence of stress ﬁbers submitted to a regulation by Rho . In an attractive model of permeabilized platelets , it has been demonstrated that the introduction of a dominant - negative mutant N17Rac1 prevents exposure of actin ﬁlament barbed ends caused by thrombin , whereas a constitutively active mutant V12Rac1 promotes exposure of actin ends that precedes nucleation of new actin ﬁlaments . 3 One work demonstrates that Cdc42 and Rac accumulate in activated GTP - bound forms in response to thrombin and that Cdc42 associates with actin cytoskeleton , whereas Rac relocalizes to the plasma membrane . 4 However , except that Cdc42 and Rac1 must be activated before actin assembly , the steps between their activation and platelet actin remodeling are less known . The p21 - activated kinases ( PAKs ) are serine / threonine ki - nases that have been proposed as downstream effectors of those GTPases . 5 , 6 At least 4 isoforms have been reported in mammals . PAKs exhibit a N - terminal regulatory domain with a GTPase - binding cassette , a proline - rich domain that binds SH3 - containing proteins and a C - terminal kinase domain . The regulatory mecha - nisms of PAK activation have been extensively studied and result both from binding of Cdc42 - GTP and Rac - GTP and autophosphor - ylation of serine / threonine residues in the regulatory domain that leads to opening of the molecule , transphosphorylation of threonine 423 in PAK1 or threonine 402 in PAK2 , and substrate access to the kinase domain . 7 - 9 Evidence has been provided that integrin interac - tion with extracellular matrix promotes the activation of Rac1 / Cdc42 and PAK in the NIH 3T3 cell line , 10 and it has been hypothesized that PAK also plays an important role in regulating actin stress ﬁber disassembly and , thus , the turnover of focal complexes . These effects are in part mediated through PAK phosphorylation and inhibition of the myosin light chain kinase 11 and also through an upstream regulation of the focal adhesion adapter protein paxillin . 12 In platelets aggregated in response to thrombin , PAK2 is rapidly activated . 13 This ﬁnding suggests that PAK activation may play a primary role in extensive cytoskeleton reorganization in platelets . The aim of the present work was to investigate the relationship between PAK activation and early platelet shape change prior to aggregation . Filopodia formation and lamellae spreading have been obtained from platelets stimulated through G - coupled protease - activated receptor 1 ( PAR - 1 ) by thrombin or thrombin receptor - activating peptide ( TRAP ) and through the low - afﬁnity receptor for From the De´partement d’He´matologie and De´partement de Biologie Cellulaire , Institut Cochin , Institut National de la Sante´ et de la Recherche Me´dicale ( INSERM ) , Centre National de la Recherche Scientiﬁque ( CNRS ) , Universite´ Rene´ Descartes , Laboratoire Central d’He´matologie , Hoˆpital Cochin , AP - HP and E9907 INSERM , Faculte´ Xavier Bichat , Paris , France .

Production of GST - fused recombinant proteins and puriﬁcation of recombinant human cortactin The GTPase - binding domain ( PBD ) of human PAK1 ( amino acids 67 - 150 ) , PAK1 wild type ( full length ) in fusion with GST cloned into the bacterial expression vector pGEX - 4T3 and PAK1 T423E ( active mutant ) in pCMV6m was a gift from Dr G . Bokoch ( Scripps Institute , La Jolla , CA ) . PAK1 T423E cDNAwas inserted into pGEX - 4T3 . GST - cortactin cloned into PXZ - 122 was a giftfromDrX . Zhan ( AmericanRedCross , Rockville , MD ) . GST - fusedproteins were coupled to glutathione - Sepharose beads and stored at (cid:7) 80°C as a 50 % suspensionin25mMTris ( tris ( hydroxymethyl ) aminomethane ) – HCl , pH7 . 4 , 0 . 2 mM DTT ( dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ) , 1 mM MgCl 2 , and 5 % glycerol . Recombinant human ( rHu ) cortactin was puriﬁed on a glutathione - Sepharose columnandcleavedfromGSTbythrombin . Afﬁnity precipitation using GST - fused proteins Precipitation of activated Rac1 or Cdc42 was performed according to Benard et al . 21 Platelets were lysed in 25 mM Tris pH 7 . 4 , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 100 mM NaCl , 1 % Nonidet P - 40 ( NP - 40 ) , 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride ( PMSF ) and protease inhibitors . Cytoskeletal and NP - 40 – soluble fractions were separated by centrifugation at 10 000 g for 20 minutes . PBD - GST was used to trap Rac1 - GTP or Cdc42 - GTP in 100 (cid:5) L NP - 40 – soluble fraction . Incubation was performed after addition of 200 (cid:5) Lbinding buffer ( 25 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 4 , 1 mM DTT , 30 mM MgCl 2 , 40 mM NaCl , 0 . 5 % Nonidet P - 40 ) for 1 hour at 4°C .

PAK REGULATES PLATELET LAMELLIPODIASPREADING 4463 BLOOD , 15 DECEMBER 2002 (cid:1) VOLUME 100 , NUMBER 13 Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot After stimulation , platelets were lysed in 3 (cid:6) solubilization buffer for 20 minutes on ice . Lysates were clariﬁed by centrifugation at 4°C for 10 minutes at 10 000 g and precleared by incubation for 1 hour at 4°C with 20 (cid:5) L protein G – Sepharose 4B packed beads . In some experiments , lysates were sonicated and incubated for 45 minutes at 37°C with DNase I ( Roche Molecular Biochemicals , Mannheim , Germany ) . Immunopre - cipitations were performed for 2 hours in ice with 5 (cid:5) g / mL polyclonal anti - PAK2 or monoclonal anticortactin antibodies . Immune complexes were collected on 25 (cid:5) L protein G – Sepharose 4B packed beads during 1 hour at 4°C under agitation . Beads were washed 3 times in 1 (cid:6) solubilization buffer and twice in the same buffer containing 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 . Proteins were solubilized in Laemmli buffer , separated by SDS - PAGE , and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for speciﬁc immunoblotting . PAK in vitro kinase assay PAK was immunoprecipitated as described above . Dried beads were recovered in 1 (cid:6) kinase buffer ( 50 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 4 , 10 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM MnCl 2 , 0 . 4 mM DTT ) . Puriﬁed myelin basic protein ( MBP ; 1 (cid:5) g ) or 5 (cid:5) g puriﬁed rHu cortactin was added , and the reaction was started by the addition of a mixture of 20 (cid:5) M MgCl 2 - adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) and 0 . 185 MBq ( 5 (cid:5) Ci ) (cid:3) [ 32 P ] - ATP ( speciﬁc activity , 111 TBq / mmol ) in 40 (cid:5) L 1 (cid:6) kinase buffer for 20 minutes at 30°C . The reaction was stopped by the addition of 10 (cid:5) L 5 (cid:6) Laemmli sample buffer . Samples were boiled for 5 minutes and analyzed on 12 % SDS - PAGE . Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane before exposure for 2 hours at (cid:7) 80°C onto Kodak ﬁlm . Signals on autoradiographies were quantiﬁed by using the Visio - Mic system ( Genomic , Collonges - sous - Saleve , France ) . After de - crease of radioactivity , PAK was quantiﬁed by immunoblot with anti - PAK1 / 2 antibody . Statistical analysis Results for ﬂow cytometry experiments were expressed as mean (cid:8) SD and compared by using the Student t test . Results Time course of actin polymerization and reorganization in activated platelets Phalloidin binding to polymerized actin during platelet shape change stimulated by optimal concentrations of various activators was quantiﬁed by ﬂow cytometry analysis . Platelets were activated through PAR - 1 receptor by thrombin ( THR ) or TRAP , through GpVI by CVX or ITAM - containing receptor Fc (cid:3) RIIAby monoclo - nal IV . 3 antibody followed by stimulation of Fc (cid:3) RIIA clustering with antimouse IgG F ( ab (cid:4) ) 2 . In the presence of THR ( 0 . 5 UI / mL ) , TRAP ( 10 (cid:5) M ) , or IV . 3 ( 2 (cid:5) g / mL ) , the relative ﬂuorescence emission intensity ( RFI ) was already maximal after 0 . 5 minutes of stimulation , although it reached its maximum after 1 minute of stimulation with CVX ( 250 pmol / L ) . THR , TRAP , IV . 3 , and CVX induced a 1 . 8 - , 2 . 2 - , 2 . 0 - , and 1 . 7 - fold increase of the content of polymerized actin after 1 minute of stimulation , respectively ( Figure 1A ) . Spatial organization of polymerized actin was visual - ized by confocal microscopy ( Figure 1B ) . After stimulation for 1 minute with thrombin or IV . 3 , platelets emitted few thin and short ﬁlopodia , and actin was rearranged as a cortical ring under the plasma membrane that spread lamellae . CVX induced extensive platelet spreading as assessed by the presence of a marked ring of actin without evidence of ﬁlopodia . These results established that CVX speciﬁcally leads platelets to spread that clearly differ from the physiologic aspect of ﬁlopodia and lamellae . Time course of Cdc42 and Rac1 activation after stimulation with thrombin , TRAP , CVX , or IV . 3 Because of the role of Cdc42 and Rac1 in actin reorganization , we studied the level of Cdc42 - GTP and Rac1 - GTP during stimulation by thrombin , TRAP , CVX , or IV . 3 . We used the PAK1 binding domain in fusion with GST ( PBD - GST ) to trap Cdc42 and Rac1 in their GTP - bound form from the detergent - soluble fraction of platelets . In the presence of exogenously added GTP (cid:3) S , full activation of Cdc42 or Rac1 was obtained . No residual Cdc42 or Rac1 was detected in the supernatants . In the presence of an excess of GDP , Cdc42 and Rac1 , maintained in an inactive state , were unable to bind to PBD - GST beads and remained in the supernatants ( Figure 2A ) . These results validate the speciﬁcity of PBD - GST beads for the detection of Cdc42 - GTP and Rac1 - GTP . In platelets stimulated by thrombin or TRAP , both Cdc42 - GTP and Rac1 - GTP accumulated from 0 . 2 minutes of stimulation . After Fc (cid:3) RIIA activation , Rac1 was also rapidly activated , although Cdc42 - GTP was only transiently detected . The amount of Rac1 - GTP increased slowly until 3 minutes following treatment by CVX , whereas activated Cdc42 was quite undetectable ( Figure 2B , upper Figure 1 .

Results are expressed as ratios of mean ﬂuorescence intensity ( RFI ) of stimulated to resting platelets and reported as means ( (cid:8) SD ) of RFI from at least 6 experiments . ( B ) Platelets stimulated for 1 minute were also analyzed by confocal ﬂuorescence microscopy ( (cid:6) 100 ) . Results are representative of 3 separate experiments . 4464 VIDALet al BLOOD , 15 DECEMBER 2002 (cid:1) VOLUME 100 , NUMBER 13 panel ) . Quantiﬁcation by densitometry analysis shows that throm - bin or TRAP induced a 2 - or 3 - fold increase of the amount of Cdc42 - GTP and a 2 . 5 - or 3 . 6 - fold increase of the amount of Rac1 - GTP , after 3 minutes . Both IV . 3 and CVX were stimulated by the accumulation of Rac1 - GTP ( Figure 2B , lower panel ) . Although Cdc42 was present in the detergent - soluble supernatants and did not translocate efﬁciently to the cytoskeleton fraction ( Figure 2C ) , less than a 1 . 5 - fold increase or no increase of Cdc42 - GTP was observed after Fc (cid:3) RIIA or GpVI activation , respectively . These results show that ﬁlopodia and subsequent lamellipodia formation induced by thrombin , TRAP , or IV . 3 coincides with the activation of Cdc42 and Rac1 . CVX that produces extensive lamellae only activates Rac1 . Activation of PAK Direct binding of the GTP - bound form of Cdc42 and / or Rac1 to the regulatory domain of PAK resulted in the activation of the kinase . 5 In an attempt to compare the amount of activated PAK in stimulated platelets , we used an in vitro phosphorylation assay , allowing the analysis of PAK autophosphorylation and kinase activity toward MBP as an exogenous substrate . As shown in Figure 3A , thrombin ( 0 . 5 UI / mL ) , as well as TRAP ( 10 (cid:5) M ) , CVX ( 250 pmol / L ) , or IV . 3 ( 2 (cid:5) g / mL ) induced an efﬁcient autophosphorylation of PAK and an increase in MBP phosphor - ylation , after 3 minutes of stimulation . Anti - PAK1 / 2 immuno - blot showed that the amounts of immunoprecipitated PAK were equal . The time course of PAK activation was followed in thrombin - stimulated platelets ( Figure 3B , left ) . Quantiﬁcation of pMBP to total PAK by densitometry analysis showed that MBP phosphoryla - tion increased until 3 minutes ( Figure 3C ) . The occurrence of PAK autophosphorylation in platelets stimulated by THR for 1 minute was conﬁrmed by direct immunoblot with anti - pPAK1 / 2 ( Thr423 / Thr402 ) antibody ( Figure 3B , right ) . These results demonstrate that platelet agonists induce an activation of PAK that correlates with activation of the GTPases . Figure 2 . Activation of Cdc42 and Rac1 in platelets .

PAK REGULATES PLATELET LAMELLIPODIASPREADING 4465 BLOOD , 15 DECEMBER 2002 (cid:1) VOLUME 100 , NUMBER 13 Inhibition of thrombin - induced activation of Cdc42 / Rac1 blocks PAK activation Considering that PAK activation by thrombin was linked to early and sustained activation of Cdc42 and Rac1 , we investigated whether small G protein activation would be necessary for PAK activation . To test this hypothesis , we used membrane - permeable clostridial toxins to inactivate Cdc42 or Rac1 . Large molecular weight cytotoxins ( 250 - 300 kDa ) such as toxin B from C difﬁcile and lethal toxin ( LT ) from C sordellii possess a glucosyltransferase activity , allowing glucosylation and , thus , inactivation of small G proteins . Indeed , toxin B and LT affect different intracellular target proteins . Toxin B has been reported to inactivate Rho , Rac , and Cdc42 , whereas the targets of LT , isolated from strain IP - 82 , are p21Ras , Ral , Rap , and Rac proteins . 22 , 23 Platelets pretreated or not with LT or toxin B were stimulated with thrombin , and , subse - quently , the amounts of activated Cdc42 , Rac1 , and PAK were determined . We observed that the level of Rac1 - GTP after a 1 - minute stimulation with thrombin was decreased in platelets pretreated with LT compared with untreated cells . Toxin B was also found to efﬁciently reduce Rac1 activity . The activation of Cdc42 was decreased by a pretreatment with toxin B but not with LT . Phosphorylation of MBP was unaffected by the presence of LT , whereas toxin B did not permit the activation of PAK over the basal level ( Figure 4A ) . A complete blockage of PAK activity results from a decrease of the amount of both Cdc42 - GTP and Rac1 - GTP . This ﬁnding suggests that full activation of both Cdc42 and Rac1 is required for stimulation of PAK activity . Inhibition of Cdc42 and Rac1 blocks actin polymerization and shape change induced by thrombin The effects of LT or toxin B were tested on the amount of polymerized actin in phalloidin - labeled platelets by ﬂow cytom - etry . We observed that , whereas LT or toxin B had no signiﬁcant effect on the content of preexisting polymerized actin in platelets at rest ( time 0 ) , they both inhibited early movements of actin after stimulation by thrombin ( Figure 4B ) . The distribution of polymerized actin was studied after treat - ment with toxin B or LT by confocal microscopy ( Figure 4C ) . In unstimulated platelets , no obvious modiﬁcation in platelet shape was observed after toxin B or LT treatment . After a 1 - minute stimulation with thrombin , LT inhibited the aspect of spread platelets and prevented the formation of the cortical ring of polymerized actin . Toxin B also blocked actin rearrangement . These results indicate that activation of Cdc42 and / or Rac1 is necessary for thrombin - induced shape change . Cortactin is constitutively associated with PAK and dissociated from PAK after thrombin stimulation Cortactin is an ubiquitous cortical - actin binding protein highly present at the cell periphery , within membrane rufﬂes and lamelli - podia . 24 In Swiss 3T3 cells , it has been demonstrated that dominant - negative N17Rac1 blocks cortactin translocation to the membrane rufﬂes and that introduction of an active form of PAK1 stimulated this translocation . 25 These observations suggest that translocation of cortactin is controlled by the Rac1 / PAK pathway . Thus , we investigated whether cortactin would interact with PAK . In vitro pull - down experiments showed that cortactin associated with GST - PAK WT ( full length ) and not with the constitutively active mutant GST - PAK T423E in resting platelets . In addition , PAK associ - ated with GST - cortactin ( Figure 5A ) . In vivo coimmunoprecipita - tion experiments demonstrated that cortactin was constitutively associated with PAK ( Figure 5B , left ) and , conversely , that PAK coimmunoprecipitated with cortactin in resting platelets ( data not shown ) . Furthermore , cortactin dissociated from PAK after a 1 - minute stimulation with thrombin . These results suggest that activated PAK , either the active mutant or the PAK activated by thrombin , loses its ability to bind cortactin . When platelets were incubated with toxin B , PAK autophosphorylation induced by thrombin was inhibited , and the binding of cortactin to PAK was restored ( Figure 5C ) . This result conﬁrms that the interaction of cortactin with PAK is regulated by PAK phosphorylation and that PAK activation causes cortactin dissociation . Figure 4 .

Results are representative of 3 separate experiments . 4466 VIDALet al BLOOD , 15 DECEMBER 2002 (cid:1) VOLUME 100 , NUMBER 13 In an attempt to determine whether the interaction between PAK and cortactin may depend on the state of actin polymerization , we incubated resting platelet lysates with increasing concentrations of DNase I that depolymerizes F - actin . DNase I forms a very tight 1 : 1 complex with G - actin , prevents interaction between myosin and G - actin , and blocks the dynamics of ﬁlament elongation . 26 The level of cortactin that coprecipitated with PAK increased with the enhancement of DNase I concentration ( Figure 5B , right ) . This ﬁnding suggests that only a fraction of cortactin is in association with PAK . Furthermore , it could not be excluded that the constitu - tive association of cortactin with PAK may be indirect because actin has been found to coimmunoprecipitate with these proteins . In vitro phosphorylation of cortactin by PAK In addition to efﬁcient tyrosine phosphorylation by Src , it has been established that cortactin is also phosphorylated on serine or threonine residues . We performed in vitro phosphorylation assays with immunoprecipitated PAK in the presence of bacterially produced and puriﬁed recombinant cortactin . As shown in Figure 6 , recombinant cortactin was phosphorylated by thrombin - activated PAK , whereas it remained unphosphorylated when PAK was immunoprecipitated from resting platelets . This ﬁnding suggests that cortactin is an in vitro substrate for PAK . Immunolocalization of Rac1 , PAK , and cortactin in thrombin - activated platelets Because of the disruption of the interaction between PAK and cortactin after thrombin stimulation , we performed immunoﬂuores - cence studies to precise their subcellular localization . Rac1 and cortactin appeared homogeneously distributed in resting platelets . After stimulation , they moved to the submembrane region , forming a ring of ﬂuorescence in the vicinity of lamellae and also invaded ﬁlopodia . PAK was sparsely distributed in resting platelets and focused near the membrane after stimulation . Similar results were obtained in TRAP - stimulated platelets . These results conﬁrm that cortactin and PAK are differentially distributed throughout stimu - lated platelets and that both Rac1 and cortactin relocalize into lamellipodia ( Figure 7 ) . Discussion In the present work , we show that lamellae spreading induced by thrombin , TRAP , monoclonal IV . 3 antibody , or CVX correlates with the activation of PAK .

PAK REGULATES PLATELET LAMELLIPODIASPREADING 4467 BLOOD , 15 DECEMBER 2002 (cid:1) VOLUME 100 , NUMBER 13 and Rac1 with clostridial toxin B inhibits PAK activation by thrombin and platelet shape change . In resting platelets , the cortical actin - binding protein , cortactin , is constitutively associated with PAK , and the disruption of cortactin association with PAK is concomitant with the occurrence of lamellae spreading in response to thrombin . Inhibition of PAK activation by toxin B prevents the dissociation of cortactin . Small G protein activation is commonly observed after ligand binding to heterotrimeric G protein – coupled receptors for bomb - esin or bradykinin or to tyrosine kinase receptors such as platelet - derived growth factor ( PDGF ) , epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) , and insulin receptors . 1 , 2 , 27 In platelets , Cdc42 and Rac1 activation occurs after stimulation of G - coupled PAR - 1 by TRAP or throm - bin . 4 , 28 Rac is also activated in response to collagen . 28 Fc (cid:3) / Fc (cid:3) RIIA receptor - mediated phagocytosis in leucocytes requires Cdc42 and Rac activation , 29 , 30 and we show , here , that the clustering of Fc (cid:3) RIIA , in platelets , increases the amount of Rac1 - GTP and , in a lesser extent , Cdc42 - GTP . In addition , we show that speciﬁc activation of the major receptor for collagen , GpVI , by CVX induces the activation of Rac1 . Considering that Gq - coupled PAR - 1 stimulates phospholipase C (cid:2) ( PLC (cid:2) ) and that both Fc (cid:3) RIIA and GpVI implicate the tyrosine kinase Syk in the activation of PLC (cid:3) 2 . 15 , 31 Rac activation , at least , is downstream of PLC activation and , consequently , on a raise of intracellular calcium , as suggested previously . 28 However , the mechanism of Rac activation is not unique . Rac activation through GpVI may require phosphatidylinositol 3 (cid:4) ( PI - 3 ) kinase that is necessary for full activation of PLC (cid:3) 2 , although it is independent of PI - 3 kinase after thrombin or TRAP . 4 , 28 , 32 Inhibition of Cdc42 and Rac1 by clostridial toxin B blocks thrombin - induced ﬁlopodia extension and lamellae spreading , conﬁrming that they are events dependent on Cdc42 and Rac1 . PAK activity is also regulated through heterotrimeric G - coupled receptors , and , in platelets , PAK2 is activated by thrombin . 6 , 13 In a recent paper , Suzuki - Inoue et al 32 demonstrate that PAK , concomi - tantly with Rac , is activated during platelet spreading on immobi - lized collagen . This activation is dependent on integrin (cid:1) 2 (cid:2) 1 and possibly on GpVI . Here , we show that PAK is activated in response to TRAP , monoclonal IV . 3 antibody , and the GpVI ligand , CVX . The activation of PAK by thrombin is dependent on Cdc42 and Rac1 , because it is blocked when GTPases are inhibited by toxin B . It has been suggested that membrane relocalization of PAK strongly enhances its GTPase - dependent activation , for instance , in the neuronal PC12 cell line . 33 This may increase its accessibility to high local concentrations of GTP - bound forms of Cdc42 and Rac1 and facilitates PAK autophosphorylation . It is interesting to note that PAK relocalizes near the platelet membrane ( Figure 7 ) as well as Rac1 that moves to the edge of the cell . 4 Thus , the subcellular localization of PAK may also be important for full activation in platelets . For the ﬁrst time , we show , here , that the cortical actin - binding protein , cortactin , is constitutively associated with PAK in resting platelets and that PAK autophosphorylation by thrombin correlates with the disruption of this interaction . Cortactin is an important regulator of actin ﬁlament polymerization . Recent evidence has been provided that cortactin colocalizes with F - actin and the Arp2 / 3 complex in lamellipodia structures , where it can promote the nucleation of new actin ﬁlaments , as demonstrated in proliferat - ing NIH 3T3 ﬁbroblasts and in MDA breast cancer cells with ampliﬁcation of the gene at chromosome 11q13 . 34 , 35 In thrombin - stimulated platelets , cortactin translocates to the cytoskeleton fraction . 36 Furthermore , in Swiss 3T3 cells , cortactin is known to translocate from the cytosol to the F - actin at the membrane rufﬂes under the control of Rac1 . 25 Thus , cortactin relocalization in platelets could also be under the control of Rac1 . Our present data suggest that the subcellular localization of a pool of cortactin is dependent on PAK activation . This suggestion is assessed by the fact that ( 1 ) cortactin is unable to associate with an active mutant of PAK in vitro , ( 2 ) a pool of cytosolic cortactin dissociates from PAK after activation of PAK by thrombin , and ( 3 ) dissociation is inhibited by inhibition of PAK autophosphorylation by toxin B . Furthermore , in the absence of PAK activation in resting platelets , the enhancement of the pool of unpolymerized actin after DNase I treatment also increases the pool of cortactin associated with PAK . Thus , the size of the pool of cytosolic cortactin stably associated with PAK may vary , depending on the degree of actin poly - merization . Cortactin is a well - known substrate for the tyrosine kinase Src . 24 In a previous paper , we have shown that cortactin transloca - tion to the detergent - insoluble cytoskeleton fraction could not be inhibited by the Src family kinase inhibitor PP2 , suggesting that cortactin relocalization in the vicinity of F - actin may be indepen - dent of tyrosine phosphorylation . 36 In addition , it has been shown that p85 cortactin is heavily charged with phosphate on serine and threonine residues . 37 In colon carcinoma cells with cortactin gene ampliﬁcation , p85 spontaneously relocalizes to the cell periphery at focal contacts with the matrix . Here , we show that bacterially produced recombinant cortactin is phosphorylated in vitro by thrombin - activated PAK and that cortactin colocalizes with Rac1 to the ring of actin ﬁlaments in lamellae , in the same conditions of stimulation . Taken together , these data suggest that the determinant for cortactin relocalization is rather a serine / threonine than a tyrosine phosphorylation . As previously published , the Nf2 tumor suppressor gene product , merlin , is phosphorylated by PAK2 . Unphosphorylated merlin localizes in the microvilli of the normal kidney epithelial cell line , LLC - PK1 , although it relocalizes to larger membrane protrusions when phosphorylated . 38 Thus , PAK is able to inﬂuence the subcellular localization of its substrates . Tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin by Src has been demon - strated to down - regulate its ability to bind F - actin in vitro . 39 However , the inﬂuence of serine / threonine phosphorylation on cortactin F - actin binding activity is not known . Interestingly , it has been recently shown that the intermediate ﬁlament protein , vimen - tin , when phosphorylated by PAK , loses its potential to form 10 - nm ﬁlaments . 40 In contrast , PAK phosphorylates and activates the LIM kinase that inhibits the activity of coﬁlin , an actin depolymerization factor , thus , facilitating actin polymerization . 41 Whether serine / threonine phosphorylation of cortactin by PAK may inﬂuence its actin ﬁlament growth - promoting activity remains to be determined . In conclusion , we show , in this work , that cortical actin reorganization in lamellae is supported by the Cdc42 / Rac1 / PAK pathway and is concomitant to the disruption of cortactin binding to PAK .
