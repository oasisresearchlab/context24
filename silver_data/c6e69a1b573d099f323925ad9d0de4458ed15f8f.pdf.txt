This study aim is to identify the practitioners’ clinical information needs level and analysed with their experience and correlate with gender , educational qualification and workplace . Experience is classified into six categories like ; 0 - 5years , 6 - 10years , 11 - 15years , 16 - 20years , 21 - 25years and above 25 years . Survey method is adopted and pretested questionnaire is used as a tool for data collection . Salem , Erode , Trippur , Coimbatore , and the Nilagari districts medical practitioners are used for this study . Among the 5290 samples , 10 % ( 529 ) practitioners are selected by S tratified P roportionate R andom S ampling ( SPRS ) method . One - way ANOVA , average weighted score plots and post - hoc tests are used for identification of the significant groups of the medical practitioners . From the result , experience is one of the most influenced factors of the allopathic medical practitioners clinical information needs . Key Words : Medical practitioners , Clinical Information Needs , Influencing factors Introduction Medical Information is playing a vital in the allopathic medical practice . Technological advances have made medical information a new basic resource like matter and energy . It provides knowledge and intelligence to the users . Therefore , information is necessary and the information generated at any point is procured , organized and disseminated expeditiously to its optimum use . Information must be made available at the right time without any barrier ( Sathivel Murugan , 2000 ) . A qualified medical practitioner , who is entrusted with the physical and mental well - being of his / her patients , must realize his / her obligations to his / her patients . They must also be aware of their responsibility to the development of the society ( Apurba , 2005 ) . As an information - intensive specialty without patient limits of age , gender , or medical profession , family physicians require a number of different resources to cover the broad scope of practice . Critical skill for family physicians is the timely access to that wide variety of clinical information sources that contribute to the decisions in patient care . Specific questions about patient management arise in daily practice with drug prescribing - questions , being the most common type of questions ( Ely et al , 1999 ) . The great strides of progress made in the modern medicine , diagnostic techniques , surgery and health care system have raised many problems in respect of standard of patient care , extent of human right protection and adequacy of systems and accountability . Physicians frequently rely on their personal knowledge accumulated over the years of clinical practice for patient care . They also need to update their professional knowledge periodically . They are expected to manage a wide range of medical problems for a broad patient population ( Margaret , 1997 ) . Gorman , Yao & Seshadri ( 2004 ) undertook a study to determine if the information seeking behaviour of primary care medical staff in rural areas was different to that in non - rural areas . The results showed there were no differences in terms of the number of questions asked , the number of questions pursued and the number of questions answered . This reinforced the earlier work by Dorsch ( 2000 ) who reached a similar conclusion . General practitioners ( GPs ) occupy a position of pivotal importance in the primary care led National Health Service ( NHS ) . The effective management of the patient experience and input to organizational structures and quality assurance processes are critical . Hence , knowledge services for primary care staff must be found on a close understanding of all the target user groups . It is vital that information provision meets the priorities and preferences of General Practitioners ( Sathivelmurugan & Allysornam , 2011 ) . There are two main reasons for clinical Information needs of the physicians , viz . , 1 ) to find or obtain answer to patients’ specific questions that cannot be answered through their personal knowledge alone , and 2 ) to keep abreast of the developments in clinical practice ( Karen , 2008 ) . Clinical Information Need - The need for information by doctors in the patient care setting as a tool to manage the patient ' s care . This is a different process from information use in an academic setting for teaching , research and publication . In the medical field , clinical information needs are principally generated by treating patients ( Smith , 1996 ) . Majority of the medical practitioners ( 83 - 100 % ) want updates on information pertaining to drugs and medical products / equipments clinical practice require more information on drugs ( 100 % ) , new medical products / equipments ( 73 - 76 % ) drug information ( 60 - 100 % ) ( Shafi & Mudassir , 2011 ) Patient care , keeping up - to - date , research , writing for publication , teaching , patient education , ( Tsafrir & Grinberg , 1998 ) , Drug Information for 2 nd and 3 rd Cancer ( Strasser , 1978 ) , Disease related 49 % , Drug related 23 % , treatment procedure related 19 % , ( Northup et al , 1983 ) , Treatment 31 % , Diagnosis 25 % , Drug related 14 % , General medicine 48 % , Dermatology 11 % ( Covell et al , 1985 ) , Drug related 38 % , Laboratory tests 25 % ( Williamson et al , 1989 ) Treatment 77 % , Differential diagnosis 75 % , Drug related 64 % , Diagnosis 55 % , Treatment 33 % , Orthopaedics 29 % , Internal medicine 26 % ( Woolf et al , l989 ) Specific patient 61 % , Treatment 25 % ( Osheroff et al , 1991 ) , Treatment 73 % , Drug related 49 % , Diagnosis 27 % ( Ely et al 1992 ) , Treatment 34 % , Diagnosis 28 % , Drug related 18 % , ( Bowden et al , 1994 ) , Treatment 24 % , Drug related 18 % ( Guise et al , 1994 ) are the needed information for the medical practitioners . Medical practitioner’s clinical information need is analysed with gender , educational qualification and workplace was done by Sathivelmurugan , Allysornam , & Mohankumar . These results are as follows , gender of the medical practitioners and differential diagnosis , drug adverse effects and preparation of guest lecture / CME information needs have 5 % level of statistical significant difference and diagnostic - procedures , disease - description , disease - prognosis , and treatment - efficacy have 1 % level of significant difference . There is a significant difference between the educational qualification of the practitioners and the following information needs , clinical - epidemiology , diagnosis / etiology , disease - description , emergency - protocol , higher - education , preparation of guest lecture / CME and treatment efficacy . The following information needs , clinical - epidemiology , etiology , differential - diagnosis , disease - complications , disease - descriptions , disease - prognosis , drugs adverse effects , diagnostic - procedures , emergency - protocol , higher - education , patient - education , preparation of guest lecture / CME , research and publication , treatment including drug - therapy , treatment - efficacy have significant difference ( either @ 1 % or @ 5 % level ) between the workplace . The age of the physician is one of the characteristic that influences preferences for information sources . Younger physicians appear to make greater use of medical literature and of colleagues than did their older counterparts . In contrast , older physicians more often used pharmaceutical representatives and preferred CME courses for seeking the medical information ( Stinson , 1980 ) , ( Lockyer , 1985 ) and these differences may not be attributable simply to differences in level of experience . Gruppen and colleagues found that the level of experience , either in general or with a particular problem , did not influence the physicians ' preferences for different information sources ( Gruppen , 1988 ) Objectives of this study This study was set out to understand the clinical information needs of the allopathic medical practitioners’ in Tamilnadu . It is analysed with experience . The main objectives of the present study is as follows , 1 . To find out the level of clinical information needs of the medical practitioners 2 . To correlate the clinical information needs with Gender , educational qualification and workplace of the practitioners . Methodology This study adopts a descriptive survey type of research design . The study population is selected from the following districts Salem , Erode , Tirppur , Coimbatore and the Niligris in Tamilnadu , India . Indian Medical Council , New Delhi recognized qualified medical practitioners are involved this study . Educational qualification of the study sample is MBBS , MBBS with Diploma in various disciplines and MD / MS / DNB . Doctors are doing their practice in government side , private practice and both . Government Doctors lists are collected from the Joint Director of Health and Family Welfare office and the private practitioners lists are collected I ndian M edical A ssociation ( IMA ) members in each district branches are the sample collection sources . Doctors’ lists are updated in MS - Excel for the application of sample selection method . Experience of the practitioner is classified in to six categories like ; 0 - 5years , 6 - 10years , 11 - 15years , 16 - 20years , 21 - 25years and above 25 years . Among the total samples ( 5290 ) , 10 % of samples ( 529 ) are used for this study . S tratified P roportionate R andom S ampling ( SPRS ) method was adopted for sample selection procedure . Medical college teaching faculties and other branches of medicine are excluded . Similarly , those who are not in the government side and not enrolled as a member of IMA are not included . Keeping the view of objectives , survey method is adopted for collection of primary data . Questionnaire is a tool . It is structured , preplanned , logically sequence , and also pretested . Simple average , One - way ANOVA , Weighted average score plots and Post - hoc test . Hypothesis There is no significant difference between the medical practitioners experience and their need of clinical information .

Among the listed clinical information , treatment drug therapy , differential diagnosis and disease complication information needs takes the top three positions . 2 . Among the total practitioners ( 529 ) , 28 . 544 % of them occasionally , 22 . 684 % of the practitioners sometimes and 21 . 739 % of the practitioners rarely need clinical epidemiology information for their clinical practice . There is no significant difference between the experience and the need of clinical epidemiology information . However it is differ from the practitioners’ educational qualification and workplace and same as to gender . ( Sathivelmurugan , Allysornam , & Mohankumar ) 3 . 50 . 851 % of the practitioners always , 34 . 026 % of them sometimes and 9 . 263 % of them occasionally require diagnosis / etiology information . There is a significant difference between the experience of the practitioners and diagnosis / etiology information . It is same as the educational qualification and workplace of the practitioners . At the same time it is reversed for Gender . ( Sathivelmurugan , Allysornam , & Mohankumar ) 4 . Nearly 60 % of the total practitioners always need this information , 29 . 868 % and 6 . 049 % of them sometime and occasionally require diagnostic procedures information for their professional diagnostic procedures . There is a significant difference between the experience of the practitioners and diagnostic procedure . It is same as the gender and workplace , and it differs from educational qualification of the practitioners . ( Sathivelmurugan , Allysornam , & Mohankumar ) 5 . 63 . 894 % of the total practitioners always , 27 . 410 % of them sometimes and 5 . 48 % of the practitioners occasionally need differential diagnosis information for practice . There is a significant difference between the experience of the practitioners and the need of differential diagnosis information . It is same as to gender and workplace , and differs from educational qualification . ( Sathivelmurugan , Allysornam , & Mohankumar ) 6 . 58 . 601 % always need disease description information , 29 . 490 % sometimes and 6 . 616 % of the practitioners occasionally require . There is a significant difference between the experience of the practitioners and the need of disease description . Practitioners’ gender , educational qualification and workplace have a significant difference between the disease description information . ( Sathivelmurugan , Allysornam , & Mohankumar ) 7 . Among the total practitioners ( 529 ) , 62 . 571 % of the practitioners always , 26 . 276 % of them sometimes and 6 . 427 % of them occasionally need disease complication information . There is a significant difference between the experience of the practitioners and the need of disease complication information . It is same as the workplace of the practitioners . However , it is reversed for the practitioner’s gender and educational qualification . ( Sathivelmurugan , Allysornam , & Mohankumar ) 8 . Among the total practitioners ( 529 ) , 60 . 302 % always , 26 . 276 % sometimes and 8 . 507 % occasionally need disease prognosis information . There is a significant difference between the experience of the practitioners and the need of disease prognosis information . Gender and workplace have a significant difference with the need of disease prognosis information . But it is reversed into educational qualification . ( Sathivelmurugan , Allysornam , & Mohankuma ) 9 . Out of the total practitioners ( 529 ) , 72 . 023 % of the practitioners always , 14 . 229 % sometimes and 3 . 592 % occasionally need the treatment drugs therapy information . There is a significant difference between the experience of the practitioners and the need of treatment drug therapy information . It is same as to the practitioners’ workplace . However , it is reversed for gender and educational qualification . ( Sathivelmurugan , Allysornam , & Mohankumar ) 10 . It is clear from the data , among the total medical practitioners ( 529 ) , 60 . 491 % always need this information , 27 . 032 % of them sometimes and 8 . 507 % of them occasionally need drug adverse effect information . There is a significant difference between the experience of the practitioners and the need of treatment drug effect information . It is same as to the practitioner’s workplace and reversed to educational qualification and gender of the practitioners . ( Sathivelmurugan , Allysornam , & Mohankumar ) 11 . Among the total practitioners ( 529 ) , 52 . 363 % of the practitioners always , 27 . 032 % sometimes and 11 . 720 % of them occasionally need treatment efficacy information . There is a significant difference between the experience of the practitioners and the need of treatment efficacy information . The significant difference is same as to the practitioner’s gender , educational qualification and workplace . ( Sathivelmurugan , Allysornam , & Mohankumar ) 12 . Among the total practitioners ( 529 ) , 43 % always need treatment follow - up information , 25 . 142 % sometimes and 22 . 117 % occasionally need treatment follow - up information . There is a significant difference between the experience of the practitioners and the need of follow - up information . There is no significant difference between the gender , workplace and educational qualification of the practitioners . ( Sathivelmurugan , Allysornam , & Mohankumar ) 13 . 35 . 728 % of them always , 27 . 788 % of them occasionally and 24 . 575 % of the medical practitioners sometimes require emergency protocol information . It is similar to educational qualification and workplace of the practitioners . Gender is reversed . ( Sathivelmurugan , Allysornam , & Mohankumar ) . Conclusion From the above finding shows that medical practitioners information need is significantly differ from gender , educational qualification , work place . However , medical associations , government ( both state and central ) medical college librarians come forward to take organize information literacy programmes and hands on training to the medical practitioners at various levels based on their educational qualifications , experience , and workplace . It will be more useful for social development of a nation . References Apurba , N . ( 2005 ) . Principles of forensic medicine . Kolkata : New Central Book Agency ( P ) Ltd ; . p . 14 . Bowden , V .
