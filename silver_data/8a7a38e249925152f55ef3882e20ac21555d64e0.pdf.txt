The Gammatone features presented here lead to competitive results on the EPPS English task , and considerable improvements were ob - tained by subsequent combination to a number of standard acous - tic features , i . e . MFCC , PLP , MF - PLP , and VTLN plus voicedness . Best results were obtained when combining Gammatone features to all other features using weighted ROVER , resulting in a relative im - provement of about 1L2 % in word error rate compared to the best sin - gle feature system . We also found that ROVER gives better results for feature combination than both log - linear model combination and LDA .

INTRODUCTION The starting point ofthis work was a cooperation between the Com - puter Science and the Biology Dept . of RWTH Aachen University . The aim was to use biologically inspired acoustic features for speech recognition . In the course of this work a number of biologically in - spired features were tested . This included features consisting of au - ditory filterbanks optionally supplemented by models of the inner hair cells as well as inner hair cellL - auditory synapse processing stages . With specific focus being on robustness , a large number of experiments were carried out on the AURORA 2 ( and 4 ) tasks . In the course ofthis work , Gammatone ( GT ) features especially resulted both in improvements for noisy data , and even gave slightly better results on clean data . At this point we started the work pre - sented here . A Gammatone - based feature extraction frontend was integrated into the signal - processing framework of the RWTH large vocabulary speech recognition system , and Gammatone features were tested on a large vocabulary speech recognition task , here the European Parliament Plenary Sessions ( EPPS ) English task from the TC - STAR project [ 12 ] . Since the results were competitive , sys - tematic experiments for combination of Gammatone features with a number of other . state - of - the - art acoustic features were performed . leading relative improvements in word error rate of about 12 % com - pared to the best perfornming single feature system . In Sec . 2 the extraction of the Gammatone features used here is described . Sec . 3 introduces the set of acoustic features the Gam - matone features were combined to and discusses the combination approaches used here . Finally , in Sec . 4 results for speech recog - nition experiments with Gammatone features are presented together with a systematic comparison of explicit and implicit feature com - bination approaches , followed by the conclusions and an outlook on further work in Sec . 5 . 2 . GAMMATONE FEATURES In this section we present an acoustic feature extraction based on an auditory filterbank realized by Gammatone filters . The Gammatone filter was introduced in [ 1 ] . In [ 2 ] , Gammatone filters were used for characterizing data obtained by reverse correlation from measure - ments ofauditory nerve responses of cats . The filter is defined in the time domain by the following impulse response : h ( t ) = k tr 1 exp ( - 2wr B t ) cos ( 27f ft + ) . Here , k defines the output gain , B defines the duration ofthe impulse response and thus the bandwidth , n is the order of the filter and de - termines the slope at the edges , fj is the filter ' s center frequency , and , the phase . For filter orders of n = 37 . . . 5 , the Gammatone filter is reported to give a good approximation ofthe human auditory filter . In this work , 4th order Gammatone filters were used , implemented as infinite impulse response filters according to [ 9 ] and [ 11 ] . For a sampling rate of 16kHz , the center frequencies of 68 Gam - matone filters were distributed over the frequency range according to the Greenwood function with human parameters [ 5 ] . The Green - wood function is defined as follows : pgu9 ( x ) = A ( l ax - k ) Hz For human data , suitable parameters are A = 165 . 4 ( to yield fre - quency in Hz ) , a = 2 . 1 if x is expressed as a proportion of basilar membrane length and k = 1 ( for adjusting the lower frequency limit ofthe human ear ) . The absolute values of the Gammatone filter outputs were tem - porally integrated using a 25 ms wide Hanning window width a 10 ms frame shift [ 6 ] . A spectral integration with a 9 - channel window and a 4 - channel shift followed . Then , ( l0it root or log ) compres - sion was performed , followed by cepstral decorrelation resulting in 16 cepstral coefficients . After cepstral decorrelation , normalization methods were applied , including mean and , optionally , variance nor - malization . 3X COMBINATION OF MULTIPLE ACOUSTIC FEATURES In this work , Gammatone features were combined to other acoustic feature ets using explicit and implicit combination methods Ex plicit combination was done using Linear Discriminant Analysis ( LDA ) . For LDA , specific attention was directed to shortcomings w . r . t . combination of strongly correlated features , as reported in [ 101 . 1 - 4244 - 0728 - 1 / 07 / $ 20 . 00 ©2007 IEEE IV - 649 ICASSP 2007 Table 1 .

Implicit feature combination subse - quently was performed using log - linear model combination to com - bine acoustic models trained on individual acoustic feature sets . as well as using ROVER to combine systems built using individual fea - ture sets . The individual feature sets used for combination experiments with the Gammatone features presented here comprise Mel - Fre - quency Cepstral Coefficients ( MFCC ) , Perceptual Linear Prediction ( PLP ) features , Mel - Frequency PLP ( MF - PLP ) features , as well as MFCC - based Vocal Tract Length Normalization based features plus a voicing feature ( VTLN - VOI ) . Details on the implementation of these features used here are given in [ 1L3 ] . 4 . RESULTS USING MULTIPLE FEATURES In this section , results for using Gammatone features in ASR and for combination of Gammatone features with state - of - the - art acoustic features are presented . 4 . 1 . EPPS English Corpus For all the experiments presented here , the European Parliament Ple - nary Sessions ( EPPS ) English corpus as defined for the 2006 TC - STAR Evaluation Campaign was used [ 8 ] was used . The EPPS cor - pora were built within the European project Technology and Corpora for Speech to Speech Translation ( TC - STAR ) [ 4 , 12 ] . The corpus statistics are given in Table 1 . The acoustic training was performed on the TrainO6 corpus . The DevO6 corpus was used for parameter optimization , e . g . of the language model scaling factor . The opti - mized system was then evaluated on the Evc1l6 corpus . 4 . 2 . Experimental Setup All experiments were performed using a common training proce - dure , for the sake of comparability of the results resulting from the variety of acoustic features . The training was not done from scratch . Instead , an initial alignment created by the MFCC baseline model was used to generate the models in the first iterations . The phonetic decision tree for the first iterations was also taken from the MFCC baseline . It consisted of 4 , 500 generalized triphone states , plus one for silence . Each state was modeled with a Gaussian mixture distri - bution with a global pooled covariance matrix . Altogether three iterations ofmaximum likelihood training were performed In the first iteration the features were augmented with derivatives and no LDA matrix was trained . Single Gaussian den - sities were estimated using the initial alignment and 8 splits were performed resulting in a total number of about 900k densities In the second iteration , an alignment was generated using the model from the first iteration . Then , a phonetic decision tree was built based on the new alignment followed by the estimation of an LDA matrix . A second phonetic decision tree and a second LDA were estimated afterwards . In the next step , single Gaussian densi - ties were estimated and split 8 times . The LDA transformation was applied to 9 consecutive time frames , and an output dimension of 45 was used . The third iteration was done in the same way as the second . The initial alignment was created using the model from the previous iteration . A 4 - gram language model with modified Kneser - Ney discount - ing was used for recognition . The language model scaling factor was optimized on the development set . 4 . 3 . Baseline Results : Single Feature Systems An MFCC frontend with logarithmic compression and mean normal - ization was taken as baseline . Additionally , systems with 10th root compression and variance normalization were trained to compare the effects of different postprocessing on the MFCC and Gammatone - based features . The Gammatone feature extraction presented here was compared with the performance of the standard feature extraction methods MFCC , PLP and MF - PLP , the results are shown in Table 2 . The best result with Gammatone - based features was 177 . 9 % on the development and 144 . 5 % on the evaluation corpus using 10th root compression and mean & variance normalization . These results are similar to the error rates obtained with the standard methods . The er - ror rate ofthe Gammatone features on the development set is slightly worse than the result of PLP and MFCC . On the evaluation set , the Gammatone features perform as good as the MFCCs . It should be noted that variance normalization for both MFCC and GT features with 1Ot ' root compression gave improvements , whereas degradations were observed using log compression . It is also interesting to notice that the results for 10th root compression are better than using log compression for both MFCC and GT fea - tures , cf . Table 2 . Table 2 .

Feature Combination : Linear Discriminant Analysis ( LDA ) As discussed in previous work [ 110 ] , using LDA for feature combina - tion can lead to considerable degradations when combining strongly correlated or even dependent features . The same we observed when combining Gammatone features with 110th root compression and mean & variance normalization with MFCC features with log com - pression and mean normalization . The results are given in the first row of Table 3 Since both features contain an energy coefficient , in the next step we tried . to use only one of the energy coefficients . The IV - 650 Table 3 .

As shown in the second row of Table 3 , this step leads to an improvement on the evaluation set , but on the development set results are still worse than the better of the two single features ( cf . Table 2 for the single fea - ture results ) . Assuming that the LDA - estimation is problematic for this case , another idea was that the information extracted by LDA is spread upon more output dimension than in the well - estimated case . Therefore , the LDA output dimension was increased from 45 to 60 . As shown in Table 3 , this step leads to improvements for both the dev and the eval set , provided the energy coefficient is taken from one feature set only . When repeating the original combination exper - iment for combination of MFCC ( with log compression ) , MF - PLP and PLP features as reported in [ 10 ] , the latter observation could not be confirmed when using an LDA output dimension of 60 . Table 4 shows , that even in the case of using only one of the energy coeffi - cients ofall three features , the LDA combination results is still worse than the result of at least the best individual feature based system .

Model Combination : Log - Linear Due to the shortcomings of LDA for the case of acoustic feature combination , in the next step we investigated log - linear acoustic model combination for the combination ofthe MFCC ( with log com - pression and mean normalization ) and the Gammatone feature set ( with 10th root compression and mean & variance normalization ) . The optimal weight exponent A is determined by grid search on the development set . The results are given in Table 5 . The best result on the development set was obtained with a weight of A 0 . 6 for the MFCC model and a weight of 1 - A for the Gammatone model resulting in a WER of 16 . 6 % on the dev set . The combination results in an absolute improvement of 0 . 5 on the evaluation corpus , which nevertheless is not better than the corresponding result using LDA for feature combination , cf . Table 3 . 4 . 6 . System Combination : ROVER Finally , ROVER [ 3 ] was investigated for the combination of sys - tems based on individual feature sets . Altogether , five acoustic tea - tureslsystems were used in the ROVER experiments . Besides the Table 5 . Results for log - linear model combination .

To get an idea of the system combination potential , also oracle error rates were included which represent the best word error rate to be obtained given the ROVER alignment . Here , we investi - gated the effect of combining Gammatone features to all the other features . For a given number of systems combined , the results are ordered . in descending order with respect to single feature system performance , and results for lower numbers of systems combined are given higher up in Table 6 . It should be noted that the results IV - 651 - - - 1 - II - - - obtained by ROVER are fully consistent , i . e . the error rates decrease both when combining better systems and when increasing the num - ber of systems combined . When combining all features , a relative improvement of approx . 122 % in word error rate compared to the best individual feature system is obtained for weighted ROVER . 4 . 7 . Comparison of Feature Combination Methods In Table 7 the results for combining MFCC and Gammatone features using explicit feature combination with LDA and implicit feature combination using either log - linear model combination or ROVER are presented . Clearly , the best results are obtained using ROVER , resulting in a relative improvement of about 6 % in word error rate compared to the better single feature system . Table 7 .

CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK In this work we could show that Gammatone features lead to compet - itive results for large vocabulary speech recognition . Furthermore , different methods to combine Gammatone features with a number of standard acoustic features , i . e . MFCC , PLP , MF - PLP , and VTLN plus voicedness , were investigated . Best results were obtained when combining all features using weighted ROVER , resulting in a rela - tive improvement of about 12 % in word error rate compared to the best single feature system . We also found that ROVER gives better results for feature combination than both log - linear model combi - nation and LDA . Although some shortcomings of LDA in case of feature combination could be reduced , LDA still is suboptimal . The latter still is unsatisfying since training and recognition in case of explicit feature combination would be computationally more effi - cient than implicit feature combination methods like model or sys - tem combination , since these require training of , and recognition / sco - ring using individual models / systems for each set of features . There - fore , in future work we will concentrate on improving efficiency by finding better methods of implicit / explicit feature combination . In addition we will investigate methods to do VTLN using Gammatone features . Further , these studies will be continued using full systems including VTLN speaker adaptation speaker adaptive training and discriminative training . Finally , it should be noted that the oracle error rates presented in Table 6 still are much better than the best combination results i . e the potential of system combination by far is not fully exploited , yet . Therefore , further research into improved model and / or system combination methods is due .
