Release of these proinﬂammatory responses is positively regulated by Ras - GTPases , which leads to the hypothesis that Ras glucosylation by glucosylating toxins results in ( at least ) reduced proinﬂammatory responses . Against this background , data on toxin - catalyzed Ras glucosylation are required to estimate of pro - inﬂammatory effect of the glucosylating toxins . In this study , a quantitative evaluation of the GTPase substrate proﬁles glucosylated in human colonic ( Caco - 2 ) cells treated with either TcdA , TcdB , or the related Clostridium sordellii lethal toxin ( TcsL ) was performed using multiple reaction monitoring ( MRM ) mass spectrometry .

Furthermore , the glucosylation of ( H / K / N ) Ras was detected in TcdA - ( not TcdB ) - treated cells , as analyzed exploiting immunoblot analysis using the Ras glucosylation - sensitive 27H5 antibody . Furthermore , [ 14 C ] glucosylation of substrate GTPase was found to be increased in a cell - free system complemented with Caco - 2 lysates . Under these conditions , ( H / K / N ) Ras glucosylation by TcdA was detected .

Keywords : Rho , Ras , GTPase , large clostridial glucosylating toxins , MRM analysis INTRODUCTION The family of large clostridial glucosylating toxins ( LCGTs ) encompasses toxin A ( TcdA ) and toxin B ( TcdB ) of Clostridioides diﬃcile , lethal toxin ( TcsL ) and hemorrhagic toxin ( TcsH ) from Clostridium sordellii , and large toxin ( TpeL ) from C . perfringens ( Popoﬀ and Bouvet , 2009 ; Genth and Just , 2011 ; Genth et al . , 2014 ; Jank et al . , 2015 ) . These toxins exhibit molecular masses ranging Frontiers in Microbiology | www . frontiersin . org 1 December 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 3078 fmicb - 09 - 03078 December 20 , 2018 Time : 18 : 12 # 2 Genth et al . Toxin A - Catalyzed Ras Glucosylation from 191 to 307 kDa and an AB - like domain structure with a N - terminal glucosyltransferase domain and a C - terminal delivery domain . Upon cell entry by receptor - mediated endocytosis , the LCGTs mono - O - glucosylate Rho / Ras subfamily GTPases ( D’Urzo et al . , 2012 ; Genth et al . , 2016 ) . Rho and Ras subtype proteins are key regulators of cytoskeletal dynamics , cell proliferation , and cell death / survival . Mono - O - glucosylation of RhoA at Thr - 37 or of Rac / Cdc42 and ( H / K / N ) Ras at equivalent Thr - 35 renders cellular Rho / Ras proteins inactive , resulting in a breakdown of the actin cytoskeleton , inhibition of cell proliferation , and cell death ( Dreger et al . , 2009 ; Lica et al . , 2011 ; Farrow et al . , 2013 ; May et al . , 2013 ; Wohlan et al . , 2014 ) . The glucosylating toxins are regarded to be responsible for the loss of intestinal barrier function and for inﬂammation observed in C . diﬃcile - associated diarrhea ( CDAD ) , C . sordellii - induced haemorrhagic enteritis and enterotoxemia , and C . perfringens - associated necrotic enteritis ( Popoﬀ , 2011 ; Smits et al . , 2016 ) . In cultured cells , TcdA and TcdB trigger inﬂammasome activation with caspase - 1 activation , based on the recognition of RhoA glucosylation by pyrin ( Ng et al . , 2010 ; Xu et al . , 2014 ) . Caspase - 1 subsequently activates IL - 1 β and IL - 18 , which in turn induce the release of IL - 6 , IFN - γ , and IL - 8 . Either of these proinﬂammatory responses is positively regulated by Ras - GTPases ( Sparmann and Bar - Sagi , 2004 ; Johnson and Chen , 2012 ) , which leads to the hypothesis that Ras glucosylation by glucosylating toxins results in ( at least ) reduced proinﬂammatory responses . Some observations support this hypothesis , as TcdB ( not the Ras glucosylating TcdA ) has been suggested to be primarily responsible for inﬂammatory responses in CDI ( Carter et al . , 2015 ; Popoﬀ , 2017 ) . Against this background , data on Ras glucosylation are required to estimate the proinﬂammatory eﬀects of the toxins . A quantitative evaluation of the GTPase substrate proﬁles glucosylated in cells treated with TcdB ( as well as with the related TcsL ) is not yet available . Therefore , the proﬁles of substrate GTPases glucosylated by TcdB , TcsL , and TcdA were evaluated in toxin - treated Caco - 2 cells using multiple reaction monitoring ( MRM ) mass spectrometry . MRM analysis allows the quantiﬁcation of the glucosylation of small GTPases in cultured cells ( Junemann et al . , 2017 ) . This study provides evidence on the glucosylation of ( H / K / N ) Ras and Rap ( 1 / 2 ) by TcsL and TcdA . In contrast , neither TcdB isoform tested glucosylated ( H / K / N ) Ras and Rap ( 1 / 2 ) . Furthermore , the glucosylation of ( H / K / N ) Ras was detected in TcdA - treated cells , as analyzed exploiting the glucosylation - sensitive Ras ( Mab 27H5 ) antibody ( Huelsenbeck et al . , 2009 ) . Finally , [ 14 C ] glucosylation of ( H / K / N ) Ras by TcdA was found in a cell - free system complemented with Caco - 2 lysates . RESULTS TcdA - Catalyzed Glucosylation of Ras Subtype GTPases in Cultured Cells The C . diﬃcile strain VPI10463 [ isolated from an abdominal wound , ( Theriot et al . , 2011 ) ] has long been regarded as a reference strain . C . diﬃcile strain VPI10463 exhibits an A + B + CDT - toxinotype i . e . , it produces TcdA - 10463 and TcdB - 10463 but not the binary C . diﬃcile toxin ( CDT ) ( Genth et al . , 2008 ) . To evaluate possible diﬀerences in the GTPase substrate proﬁles of TcdA - 10463 and TcdB - 10463 , Caco - 2 cells were treated with the toxins and GTPase substrate proﬁles were analyzed in terms of the MRM method . Treatment of Caco - 2 cells with TcdB - 10463 resulted in time - dependent mono - O - glucosylation of the Rho subtype GTPases Rho ( A / B / C ) , Rac1 , RhoG , and Cdc42 ( Figure 1A ) . Remarkably , neither Rap ( 1 / 2 ) nor ( H / K / N ) Ras were glucosylated ( Figure 1A ) . Furthermore , TcdB - 10463 - catalyzed glucosylation of Rap ( 1 / 2 ) or ( H / K / N ) Ras was observed neither upon treatment with an about three orders of magnitude higher TcdB - 10463 concentration of 2 nM ( Figure 1B ) nor upon prolonged TcdB - 10463 treatment for 48h ( Figure 1G ) . TcdA - 10463 glucosylated Rap ( 1 / 2 ) and ( less eﬃcaciously ) ( H / K / N ) Ras as well as its canonical Rho subfamily substrate GTPases including Rho ( A / B / C ) , Rac1 , RhoG , and Cdc42 ( Figures 1D , E ) . The latter observations were consistent with published data ( Junemann et al . , 2017 ) . Combined treatment of Caco - 2 cells with TcdA ( 300 pM ) and TcdB ( 3 pM ) resulted in glucosylation kinetics almost similar to that of TcdA ( 300 pM ) alone , excluding synergistic eﬀects in the kinetics of substrate GTPase glucosylation upon combined toxin treatment . The only exception was ( H / K / N ) Ras , which glucosylation seemed to suppressed upon combined treatment with TcdA and TcdB ( Figures 1D , F ) . The latter observation suggests that TcdB suppressed TcdA - catalyzed Ras glucosylation . Next , the substrate GTPase proﬁle of TcdB from the hypervirulent , toxinotype A + B + CDT + C . diﬃcile strain R20291 ( isolated from the feces of a symptomatic patient in United Kingdom ) was evaluated upon prolonged treatment of Caco - 2 cells for 48 h . TcdB - R20291 speciﬁcally glucosylated Rho / Rac / Cdc42 subtype GTPases ( but not Ras subtype GTPases ) ( Figure 1H ) . TcdB - R20291 and TcdB - 10463 thus exhibited a similar substrate GTPase proﬁle , with the Ras subtype GTPases Rap ( 1 / 2 ) and ( H / K / N ) Ras not being glucosylated ( Figures 1G , H ) . Among the family of glucosylating toxins , C . sordellii lethal toxin ( TcsL ) has been classiﬁed as the prototype of Ras glucosylating toxin ( Genth and Just , 2011 ; Genth et al . , 2014 ) . This notion was re - conﬁrmed using MRM analysis of TcsL - treated Caco - 2 cells : Ras subtype GTPases Rap ( 1 / 2 ) and ( H / K / N ) Ras were the preferred cellular substrates of the related TcsL : ( H / K / N ) Ras , Rac1 , Rap ( 1 / 2 ) > RhoG > > Rho ( A / B / C ) ( Figure 1C ) . Weak glucosylation of Rho ( A / B / C ) ( not observed until TcsL treatment for 24 h ) was background ( Figure 1C ) . In contrast to TcdA / TcdB - treated Caco - 2 cells , Cdc42 was not read from TcsL - treated Caco - 2 cells , which might due to Cdc42 degradation ( Figure 1C ) . Immunoblot analysis exploiting the Rac1 ( Mab 102 ) and the Ras ( Mab 27H5 ) antibodies have evolved into a routine method for tracking mono - O - glucosylation of cellular Rac / Cdc42 and ( H / K / N ) Ras , respectively ( Genth et al . , 2006 ; Huelsenbeck et al . , 2009 ; Brandes et al . , 2012 ) . Once Rac / Cdc42 or ( H / K / N ) Ras is mono - O - glucosylated , the antibodies do not detect their epitopes , resulting in signal loss . In contrast , the H - Ras ( C20 ) and the Rac1 ( Mab 23A8 ) antibodies are glucosylation insensitive Frontiers in Microbiology | www . frontiersin . org 2 December 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 3078 fmicb - 09 - 03078 December 20 , 2018 Time : 18 : 12 # 3 Genth et al . Toxin A - Catalyzed Ras Glucosylation FIGURE 1 | Mass spectrometry - based evaluation of the substrate GTPase proﬁles glucosylated by LCGTs . Caco - 2 cells were exposed to recombinantly prepared TcdB - 10463 ( A , B , F , G ) , to TcsL prepared from C . sordellii strain 6018 ( TcsL - 6018 ) ( C ) , recombinantly prepared TcdA - 10463 ( D – F ) , and recombinantly prepared TcdB - 20291 ( H ) . Upon cell lysis , small GTPases of the Rho and Ras subfamilies were analyzed for cellular concentrations of glucosylated GTPases using MRM analysis . Glucosylation was given as the ratio of the concentration of glucosylated GTPase per concentration of total GTPase . All experiments were conducted with three biological replicates . The error bars are representing the SD of the mean . and can be used to quantify total levels of H - Ras or Rac1 , respectively . TcdA - 10463 - treated Caco - 2 cells exhibited time - dependent glucosylation of ( H / K / N ) Ras with about 50 % of total ( H / K / N ) Ras being glucosylated after 12 h ( Figures 2A , B ) . Detection of exemplarily H - Ras using the H - Ras ( C20 ) antibody showed no decrease , indicating that the cellular level of H - Ras was not changed upon TcdA treatment ( Figure 2A ) . In contrast to ( H / K / N ) Ras , TcdA - 10463 - catalyzed glucosylation of Rac / Cdc42 was almost complete upon 3 h of TcdA treatment , as evaluated using the Rac1 ( clone 102 ) antibody ( Figures 2A , B ) . The cellular level of Rac1 was not changed as analyzed using the Rac1 ( Mab 23A8 ) antibody , conﬁrming that decreasing detection by the Rac1 ( Mab 102 ) antibody was due to glucosylation but not due to degradation ( Figure 2A ) . In TcdB - 10463 - treated Caco - 2 cells , rapid glucosylation of Rac / Cdc42 but not of ( H / K / N ) Ras was detected exploiting the Rac1 ( Mab 102 ) and the Ras ( Mab 27H5 ) antibodies ( Figure 2C ) . Taken together , ( i ) either MRM analysis or immunoblot analysis comparably tracked Rac / Cdc42 and ( H / K / N ) Ras glucosylation in toxin - treated Caco - 2 cells , ( ii ) the glucosylation of ( H / K / N ) Ras by TcdA - 10463 was delayed as compared with glucosylation of Rac / Cdc42 glucosylation , and ( iii ) ( H / K / N ) Ras was not glucosylated by TcdB - 10463 . The kinetics of Rac / Cdc42 and ( H / K / N ) Ras glucosylation were further investigated in African green monkey kidney ( Vero ) cells , an epithelial cell line with high sensitivity to the C . diﬃcile toxins ( Orth et al . , 2014 ) . In TcdA - 10463 - treated Vero cells , Rac / Cdc42 was about one order magnitude more eﬃcaciously glucosylated than ( H / K / N ) Ras , as evaluated exploiting the Rac1 ( Mab 102 ) and the Ras ( Mab 27H5 ) antibodies ( Figures 3A , B ) . In contrast to Caco - 2 cells , ( H / K / N ) Ras was completely glucosylated in TcdA - 10463 - treated Vero cells ( Figures 3A , B ) . In TcdB - 10463 - treated Vero cells , ( H / K / N ) Ras Frontiers in Microbiology | www . frontiersin . org 3 December 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 3078 fmicb - 09 - 03078 December 20 , 2018 Time : 18 : 12 # 4 Genth et al . Toxin A - Catalyzed Ras Glucosylation FIGURE 2 | Immunoblot - based analysis of the glucosylation of ( H / K / N ) Ras and Rac / Cdc42 in TcdA - and TcdB - treated Caco - 2 cells . Caco - 2 cells were exposed to natively prepared TcdA - 10463 ( A , B ) or TcdB - 10463 ( C , D ) for the indicated times . Upon cell lysis , the cellular concentrations of glucosylated ( H / K / N ) Ras and Rac / Cdc42 subtype GTPases were evaluated using immunoblot analysis . Immunoblots were quantiﬁed using Kodak software . The amounts of non - glucosylated Rac / Cdc42 and non - glucosylated ( H / K / N ) Ras relative to the respective total levels of Rac1 and H - Ras are expressed as mean ± SD of three experiments . was not glucosylated even at TcdB - 10463 concentrations two orders of magnitude greater than those required for complete Rac / Cdc42 glucosylation ( Figures 3C , D ) . These observation from Vero cells further excluded that ( H / K / N ) Ras was glucosylated by TcdB - 10463 . The cellular levels of active GTP - bound Ras were next analyzed using pull - down assay exploiting the Ras binding domain of Raf kinase ( van Triest and Bos , 2004 ) . In TcdA - 10463 - treated Vero cells , ( H / K / N ) Ras was completely inactivated , as no GTP - bound active ( H / K / N ) Ras was detected ( Figure 4 ) . In contrast , GTP - bound active ( H / K / N ) Ras was present in TcdB - and mock - treated cells ( Figure 4 ) . ( H / K / N ) Ras activates the canonical pathways leading to activation of p44 / 42 - MAP kinase ( ERK1 / 2 ) . In mock - treated Vero cells , active ERK1 / 2 was detected in terms of the cellular level of pT202 / Y204 - ERK1 / 2 . In TcdA - 10463 - treated Vero cells , almost no pT202 / Y204 - ERK1 / 2 was detected ( Figure 4 ) , reﬂecting Ras inactivation . The level of pT202 / Y204 - ERK1 / 2 was slightly reduced in TcdB - 10463 - treated cells ( as compared to mock - treated cells ) ( Figure 4 ) . This observation reﬂects that – besides ( H / K / N ) Ras – ERK1 / 2 is activated by Rac1 to some extent ( Niba et al . , 2013 ) . Slightly reduced levels of pERK1 / 2 in TcdB - treated Vero cells most likely reﬂected TcdB - catalyzed Rac1 glucosylation . The Ras - ERK pathway was thus completely inhibited in TcdA - treated Vero cells , reinforcing the view that ( H / K / N ) Ras was inactivated by TcdA . Enhanced Glucosylation of Substrate GTPases in the Presence of Caco - 2 Lysates Next , GTPase glucosylation catalyzed by the recombinant glucosyltransferase domains of TcdA - 10463 ( rN - TcdA ) and of TcdB - 10463 ( rN - TcdB ) was re - analyzed in a cell - free system . Speciﬁcally GST - Rac1 but not GST - H - Ras was [ 14 C ] glucosylated by rN - TcdA and rN - TcdB applied at a relatively low toxin concentration of 0 . 3 nM ( Figure 5A ) . In the presence of Caco - 2 lysates ( that contain the heavy and light membrane fractions ) , Rac1 glucosylation by rN - TcdA was strongly enhanced ( Figures 5A , B ) . Furthermore , partial glucosylation of Frontiers in Microbiology | www . frontiersin . org 4 December 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 3078 fmicb - 09 - 03078 December 20 , 2018 Time : 18 : 12 # 5 Genth et al . Toxin A - Catalyzed Ras Glucosylation FIGURE 3 | Immunoblot - based analysis of the glucosylation of ( H / K / N ) Ras and Rac / Cdc42 in TcdA - and TcdB - treated Vero cells . Vero cells were exposed to the indicated concentrations of native TcdA - 10463 ( A , B ) and TcdB - 10463 ( C , D ) for 16 h . The cellular levels of non - glucosylated ( H / K / N ) Ras , total H - Ras , non - glucosylated Rac / Cdc42 , total Rac1 , and beta - actin were analyzed by immunoblot analysis . Immunoblots were quantiﬁed using Kodak software . The amounts of non - glucosylated Rac / Cdc42 and non - glucosylated ( H / K / N ) Ras relative to the , respectively , levels of Rac1 and H - Ras are expressed as mean ± SD of three experiments . ( H / K / N ) Ras by rN - TcdA was observed in the presence of Caco - 2 lysates ( Figures 5A , B ) . Rac1 glucosylation by rN - TcdB was also enhanced in the presence of Caco - 2 lysates ( Figures 5A , C ) . However , ( H / K / N ) Ras glucosylation by rN - TcdB was not observed even in the presence of lysates ( Figures 5A , C ) . The recombinant glucosyltransferase domain of TcsL - 6018 ( rN - TcsL ) preferably [ 14 C ] glucosylated GST - ( H / K / N ) Ras as compared with GST - Rac1 ( Figure 6A ) , consistent with former observations ( Huelsenbeck et al . , 2009 ) . The latter observation apparently contradicts above observation that ( H / K / N ) Ras and Rac1 were glucosylated in TcsL - treated Caco - 2 cells with almost comparable kinetics ( Figure 1C ) . To solve this apparent contradiction , the glucosylation of either Rac1 and ( H / K / N ) Ras by rN - TcsL was analyzed in the presence of Caco - 2 lysates . The glucosylation of Rac1 ( Figures 6A , B ) and H - Ras ( Figures 6A , C ) was strongly increased in the presence of Caco - 2 lysates and Rac1 and ( H / K / N ) Ras were glucosylated with comparable kinetics ( Figures 6A , D ) . Comparable glucosylation of Rac1 and ( H / K / N ) Ras by rN - TcsL was thus not observed until Caco - 2 lysates were added to the cell - free system . A cell - free system complemented with Caco - 2 lysates seems to be suitable for predicting intracellular glucosylation . In sum , substrate GTPase glucosylation by either rTcdA , rTcdB and rTcsL was enhanced in a cell - free system in the presence of lysates . Under these advanced conditions , ( H / K / N ) Ras was preferably glucosylated by rN - TcsL , to some extent by rN - TcdA , but not by rN - TcdB . DISCUSSION Analysis of GTPase glucosylation by LCGT has widely been studied in cell - free systems to determine the speciﬁcities of LCGTs for particular small GTPases ( Just et al . , 1995b ; Genth et al . , 2014 ) . Initial evaluation of the proﬁles of substrate GTPase proﬁle of full - length TcdA - 10463 and TcdB - 10463 in Frontiers in Microbiology | www . frontiersin . org 5 December 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 3078 fmicb - 09 - 03078 December 20 , 2018 Time : 18 : 12 # 6 Genth et al . Toxin A - Catalyzed Ras Glucosylation FIGURE 4 | Inactivation of ( H / K / N ) Ras in TcdA - treated Vero cells . Vero cells were exposed to native TcdA - 10463 and TcdB - 10463 for 16 h . Cells were lysed and objected to effector pull - down assay exploiting the Ras - binding domain of Raf kinase . The cellular levels of GTP - loaded ( H / K / N ) Ras , total H - Ras , pT202 / pY204 - p44 / 42 - MAP kinase ( pT202 / pY204 - ERK1 / 2 ) , and total p44 / 42 - MAP kinase ( ERK1 / 2 ) were analyzed by immunoblot analysis using the indicated antibodies . cell - free systems has revealed that TcdA - 10463 and TcdB - 10463 speciﬁcally glucosylate the Rho subtype GTPases including RhoA , Rac1 , and Cdc42 but not Ras subtype GTPases ( Just et al . , 1995a , b ) . It had been assumed that similar speciﬁcity pattern exist in a cell - free and a cellular context . However , mass spectrometry - based analysis revealed that TcdA glucosylates RhoA / B / C , Rac1 , RhoG , and Cdc42 but also the Ras subtype GTPases Rap1 / 2 and ( H / K / N ) Ras in Caco - 2 cells ( Figure 1 ) ( Zeiser et al . , 2013 ; Junemann et al . , 2017 ) . The apparent contradiction that TcdA glucosylates Ras subtype GTPases in cellular but not in cell - free system is solved by advancing the cell - free system in two aspects : ( 1 ) Application of rN - TcdA : rN - TcdA better mimics the situation inside the cell , as the N - terminal glucosyltransferase domain of TcdA is cleaved oﬀ the delivery domain upon cell entry . rN - TcdA ( applied at a relatively high concentration of 100 nM ) has been shown to glucosylate a broader proﬁle of substrate GTPases ( including Ras subtype GTPases ) , while full - length TcdA fails to do so ( Genth et al . , 2014 ) ; ( 2 ) Complementation of the cell - free system with membrane - containing lysates : The substrate GTPases of the LCGTs are anchored to membranes through their C - terminally located polybasic domain and the isoprenyl residue . The 4 - helix - bundle at the very N - terminus of the glucosyltransferase domain of the LCGTs mediates membrane anchoring as well ( Varela Chavez et al . , 2015 , 2016 ; Craven and Lacy , 2016 ) . Membrane anchoring of both substrate GTPases and the glucosyltransferase domain of the LCGTs facilitates enhanced glucosylation as compared with the soluble components , as substrate GTPase glucosylation catalyzed by either rN - TcdA ( Figure 5B ) , rN - TcdB ( Figure 5C ) , and rN - TcsL ( Figure 6 ) was enhanced in a cell - free system upon addition of membrane - containing lysates . In particular , rN - TcdA - catalyzed glucosylation was strongly enhanced in the presence of Caco - 2 lysate facilitating the detection of glucosylation of ( H / K / N ) Ras ( Figures 5A , B ) . ( H / K / N ) Ras is observed to be glucosylated in TcdA - treated Caco - 2 cells , as evidenced by MRM analysis ( Figure 1 ) . In general , the LC - MS based MRM method exhibits a higher speciﬁcity but less sensitivity compared to the antibody detection . In terms of antibody detection , glucosylation of ( H / K / N ) Ras has been observed in TcdA - treated Caco - 2 and Vero cells ( Figures 2 , 3 ) , complementing the observations from the MRM analysis ( Figures 1D , E ) . Ras glucosylation results in blocked Ras signaling in TcdA - treated cells , as evidenced in terms of inhibited Ras - ERK signaling ( Figure 4 ) . In contrast to TcdA , TcdB - 10643 - catalyzed glucosylation of Ras - GTPases was observed neither in Caco - 2 cells ( Figures 1 , 2 ) nor in Vero cells ( Figure 3 ) nor in a cell - free system ( Figure 5 ) , as analyzed in terms of MRM analysis , immunoblot analysis , and [ 14 C ] glucosylation . Comparable to TcdB - 10463 , TcdB - R20291 did also not glucosylate Ras - GTPases in Caco - 2 cells ( Figure 1H ) . In conclusion , the two TcdB isoforms tested in this study ( either of which derives from C . diﬃcile toxinotype A + B + strains ) do not glucosylate Ras , which leads to the prediction that TcdB - 10463 and TcdB - R20291 more eﬃciently promote inﬂammatory response in cells as compared to TcdA - 10463 . Finally , the GTPase proﬁle of TcdB isoforms from so called variant , toxinotype A - B + strains ( such as strain 1470 ) remains to be analyzed because these strains must be expected to exhibit Ras glucosylation ( Huelsenbeck et al . , 2007 ; Genth et al . , 2008 ) . In TcsL - treated Caco - 2 cells , Rac1 and ( H / K / N ) Ras exhibited almost comparable kinetics of glucosylation ( Figure 1C ) . In a cell - free system , comparable glucosylation of Rac1 and ( H / K / N ) Ras by rN - TcsL was not observed until the cell - free system with complemented with membrane - containing lysates ( Figure 6 ) . Upon combined treatment of Caco - 2 cells with TcdA and TcdB , TcdA - catalyzed Ras glucosylation was suppressed ( Figure 1F ) . This unexpected observation suggests that TcdB is capable of reducing TcdA uptake . TcdA enters target Caco - 2 cells ( but not other yet investigated cell lines ) by clathrin - independent endocytosis , which requires intact actin dynamics ( Robertson et al . , 2009 ; Papatheodorou et al . , 2010 ; Chandrasekaran et al . , 2016 ) . TcdB - induced glucosylation of Rho - GTPases results in actin depolymerization ( May et al . , 2013 ) , which in turn might reduce TcdA uptake and subsequent Ras glucosyslation . Taken together , the proﬁles of small GTPases glucosylated by LCGTs can be analyzed with the presented methods in cell - free systems , cultured cells , and in tissue from animal models and infected humans . The presented methods will allow the identiﬁcation of new toxinotypes that exhibit diﬀerent GTPase substrate proﬁles . Finally , observations from three independent experimental systems exclude that TcdB glucosylates Ras subtype GTPases . The observations of this study leads to the recommendation that TcdB ( rather than TcdA ) should be applied Frontiers in Microbiology | www . frontiersin . org 6 December 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 3078 fmicb - 09 - 03078 December 20 , 2018 Time : 18 : 12 # 7 Genth et al .

Frontiers in Microbiology | www . frontiersin . org 7 December 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 3078 fmicb - 09 - 03078 December 20 , 2018 Time : 18 : 12 # 8 Genth et al . Toxin A - Catalyzed Ras Glucosylation as tool in cell biology research to check for an involvement of Rho subtype GTPases in cellular processes . MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials Toxins : Recombinant toxins and toxin fragments as well as native toxin were used in parallel . The glucosyltransferase domains ( covering amino acids 1 – 546 ) of TcsL ( rN - TcsL , strain 6018 ) and TcdB ( rN - TcdB , strain VPI10463 ) were expressed in Escherichia coli using the pGEX - 2T vector system and aﬃnity puriﬁed using Glutathion - Sepharose Beads ( AP Biotech ) as described ( Hofmann et al . , 1997 ) . The glucosyltransferase domain ( covering amino acid 1 to 1065 ) of TcdA ( rN - TcdA , strain VPI10463 ) and full - length TcdA - 10463 , TcdB - 10463 , and TcdB - R20291 were expressed in the Bacillus megaterium expression system ( MoBiTec , Germany ) ( Wohlan et al . , 2014 ) . Full length TcsL - 6018 was produced in C . sordellii strain 6018 and puriﬁed yielding only one band on SDS - PAGE as previously described ( Genth et al . , 2000 ) . In brief , a dialysis bag containing 900 mL of 0 . 9 % NaCl in a total volume of 4 liters of brain heart infusion ( Difco , BD Life Sciences , Heidelberg , Germany ) was inoculated with 100 mL of an overnight culture of C . sordellii . The culture was grown under microaerophilic conditions at 37 ◦ C for 72 h . Bacteria were removed from the dialysis bag solution by centrifugation . Proteins from the culture supernatant were precipitated by ammonium sulfate at 70 % saturation . The precipitated proteins were dissolved in 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 buﬀer and extensively dialyzed against 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 buﬀer for 24 h . The protein solution was loaded onto an anion exchange column ( MonoQ , AP Biotech , New Jersey , NJ , United States ) . TcdA was eluted with 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 , at 150 – 200 mM NaCl . TcsL or TcdB were eluted at 500 – 600 mM NaCl . The toxins were subsequently dialyzed against buﬀer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 5 , 15 mM NaCl ) . Immunoblot analyses were used to identify and calculate the amount of isolated toxins . Puriﬁcation of recombinant proteins : GST - tagged Rho and Ras subtype GTPases were expressed in E . coli using the pGEX - 2T vector system and aﬃnity puriﬁed using Glutathion - Sepharose Beads ( AP Biotech ) as described ( Hofmann et al . , 1997 ) . Cell Culture and Preparation of Lysates African green monkey kidney ( Vero ) cells and human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma ( Caco - 2 ) cells were cultivated in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle Medium ( DMEM ) containing 10 % fetal calf serum ( FCS ) , 100 U / ml penicillin G and 100 µ g / ml streptomycin in a humidiﬁed atmosphere containing 5 % CO 2 . Cells sub - conﬂuently seeded in 3 . 5 - cm dishes were treated with TcdA , TcdB , and TcsL according to the indicated concentrations . Upon incubation time , the cells were rinsed with 5 ml of ice - cold phosphate - buﬀered saline and scraped oﬀ in 200 µ l of Laemmli lysis buﬀer per dish . The cells were disrupted mechanically by soniﬁcation ( ﬁve times on ice ) . The lysate were submitted to immunoblot analysis . For MRM analyses cells were washed at least three times with ice - cold phosphate buﬀered saline and solubilized in Tris - HCl buﬀer , pH 7 , 5 containing 20 mM NaCl and 1 mM DTT homogenized by soniﬁcation and centrifuged at 13 , 000 × g to remove cell debris . Protein levels were determined by the method of Bradford . Crude extracts were stored at − 20 ◦ C . Immunoblot Analysis Cell lysates were separated on 15 % polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose for 2 h at 250 mA , followed by blocking with 5 % ( w / v ) nonfat dried milk for 1 h . Blots were incubated with the appropriate primary antibody with dilution according to the manufacturers’ instructions [ beta - actin ( Mab AC - 40 , Sigma ; dilution 1 : 5000 ) ; PAK2 ( Cell signaling 2608 , dilution 1 : 1000 ) ; phospho - S144 / 141 - PAK1 / 2 ( Abcam ab40795 ; dilution 1 : 2000 ) ; Rac1 ( BD Transduction Laboratories 610650 , clone 102 ; dilution 1 : 1000 ) ; Rac1 ( Millipore 05 - 389 , clone 23A8 ; dilution 1 : 1000 ) ; Ras ( Mab27H5 , Cell Signaling 3339 , dilution 1 : 200 ) ; H - Ras ( C20 , SantaCruz sc - 520 , dilution 1 : 200 ) ; in buﬀer B ( 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 2 , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM KCl , 0 . 05 % ( w / v ) Tween 20 ] for 18 h and subsequently for 2 h with a horseradish peroxidase - conjugated secondary antibody ( mouse : Rockland 610 - 1034 - 121 ; dilution 1 : 3000 ; rabbit Rockland 611 - 1302 ; dilution 1 : 3000 ) . For the chemiluminescence reaction , ECL Femto ( Pierce ) was used . The signals were analyzed densitometrically using the KODAK 1D software . Preparation of Caco - 2 Cell Lysates Caco - 2 cells were disrupted mechanically by soniﬁcation on ice in a detergent - free lysis buﬀer containing 10 mM Tris / HCl ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 10 mM NaCl , 2 mM MgCl2 , and EDTA - free protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche , Berlin , Germany ) . Crude cell lysates were centrifugated at 1 , 000 × g at 4 ◦ C for 10 min to remove the nuclear fraction and intact cells . The supernatant was used as “lysate . ” Glucosyltransferase Reaction Recombinant Rho and Ras subtype GTPases ( 50 µ g / mL ) was incubated with either rN - TcdA , rN - TcsL or rN - TcdB in glucosylation buﬀer ( 50 mM of HEPES pH 7 . 4 , 0 . 1 mM · MgCl2 , 150 mM · KCl , 100 µ g / mL of BSA , 20 µ M of UDP - [ 14 C ] glucose ) ( Biotrend , Cologne , Germany ) in a total volume of 20 µ L at 37 ◦ C for the indicated times . Proteins were analyzed by 12 . 5 % SDS - PAGE , and [ 14C ] glucosylated Rho and Ras subtype GTPases were visualized by Phosphorimaging ( Cyclone , PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences , Shelton , United States ) . MRM Analysis Multiple reaction monitoring analysis was conducted for determining glucosylation extent of small GTPases as previously described ( Junemann et al . , 2017 ) . Brieﬂy , proteins were separated by SDS - PAGE and area between 15 and 25 kDa was cut . Proteins were digested using trypsin and peptides were subjected to MRM analysis using a triple quadrupol mass spectrometer ( QTRAP4000 , SCIEX ) . Peptides were separated in a nano LC system using an Acclaim PepMap C18 column ( Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) that was directly connected to the ion source of the mass spectrometer . For quantiﬁcation acquired raw data were processed with the Skyline software ( MacCoss Lab Software , Canada ) ( MacLean et al . , 2010 ) .
