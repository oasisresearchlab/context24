S . adults 34 screened for the Communities , Households and SARS / CoV - 2 35 Epidemiology ( CHASING ) COVID Cohort Study in April 2020 . 36 Results : In logistic regression models , the adjusted odds ratio 37 [ aOR ] of hospitalization due to COVID - 19 for having ( versus not 38 having ) children in the home was 10 . 5 ( 95 % CI : 5 . 7 - 19 . 1 ) among 39 study participants living in multi - unit dwellings and 2 . 2 ( 95 % 40 CI : 1 . 2 - 6 . 5 ) among those living in single unit dwellings . Among 41 participants living in multi - unit dwellings , the aOR for COVID - 19 42 hospitalization among participants with more than 4 persons in 43 their household ( versus 1 person ) was 2 . 5 ( 95 % CI : 1 . 0 - 6 . 1 ) , and 44 0 . 8 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 15 - 4 . 1 ) among those living in single unit dwellings . 45 Conclusion : Early in the US SARS - CoV - 2 pandemic , certain 46 household exposures likely increased the risk of both SARS - CoV - 2 47 acquisition and the risk of severe COVID - 19 disease . .

Younger age may be an important 61 factor driving asymptomatic spread . Studies have shown differences in the presentation 62 of COVID - 19 between adults and children , with children less likely than adults to be 63 symptomatic and less likely to present with severe COVID - 19 disease . 13 – 16 64 Counterintuitively , other studies have suggested that children may have viral load levels 65 that are comparable to those of adults , and that they could play a role in driving 66 SARS - CoV - 2 transmission . 17 , 18 One recent study in India found that children and young 67 adults accounted for 30 % of cases . 19 Moreover , the lack of mask use early in the US 68 pandemic indoors among members of the same household who may have been 69 asymptomatic or pre - symptomatic during the first several days of quarantine under .

A recent systematic review of 40 SARS - CoV - 2 household transmission 76 studies suggests that , while the secondary attack rate within households is high ( 18 . 8 % , 77 95 % CI 15 . 4 % - 22 . 2 % ) , transmission rates are highest : a ) when the primary household 78 cases are symptomatic ( 19 . 9 % , 95 % CI : 14 . 0 % - 25 . 7 % ) vs asymptomatic ; b ) among 79 adult contacts ( 31 % , 95 % CI : 19 . 4 % - 42 . 7 % ) vs children ; and c ) in households with 80 only 1 other contact ( 45 . 2 % , 95 % CI 34 . 1 % - 51 . 8 ) vs those with 3 or more contacts . 2 81 Early studies in New York state showed high attack rates , hospitalizations , and deaths 82 within the households of index cases . 6 And a recent household transmission study 83 conducted in Tennessee and Wisconsin by the CDC found a very high and rapidly 84 occurring secondary infection rate of 53 % among household members of an index case , 85 with > 70 % of secondary cases occurring within 5 days of symptom onset of the index 86 case . 5 The effect of household transmission versus other community transmission on 87 SARS - CoV - 2 severity has not been systematically investigated . 88 89 Few household studies have examined the role of children on household transmission 90 of SARS - CoV - 2 , and those that have relied on small sample sizes . 5 , 23 , 24 Understanding 91 the risk of COVID - 19 in crowded households and households with children ( regardless 92 of whether they are the primary case in the household ) will be important in elucidating .

The objective of this study was to examine the effects of household 95 characteristics , primarily the presence of children in the household and household 96 crowding , on the risk of COVID hospitalization during the early phase of the 97 SARS - CoV - 2 pandemic in the US . 98 99 Methods : 100 Study population : 101 Study participants were individuals screened for enrollment into the Communities , 102 Households , and SARS / CoV - 2 Epidemiology ( CHASING ) COVID Cohort study who 103 completed an initial baseline assessment . The CHASING COVID Cohort study is a 104 national prospective cohort study of adults from the US and US territories that was 105 launched on March 28 , 2020 to understand the spread and impact of the SARS - CoV - 2 106 pandemic within households and communities . The survey methodology is described in 107 detail in a previous publication . 25 Briefly , study participants were recruited online through 108 social media platforms or through referrals using advertisements that were in both 109 English and Spanish . The platform Qualtrics ( Qualtrics , Provo , UT ) , an online survey 110 platform widely used in social and behavioral research , was used for data collection . 111 112 The initial baseline assessment captured information on household characteristics , 113 underlying risk factors , SARS - CoV - 2 symptoms , and health - seeking behaviors such as 114 testing and hospitalizations . A second version of the initial baseline questionnaire was 115 launched on April 9 , 2020 to capture healthcare and essential worker status . A total of .

Symptoms assessed included any of the following : 124 fever , chills , rigors , runny nose , myalgia , headache , sore throat , stomach ache , 125 diarrhea , nasal congestion , nausea , vomiting , cough or coughing up blood or phlegm , 126 shortness of breath . Those reporting any of these symptoms who reported also being 127 hospitalized as a result of their reported symptoms were classified as having the 128 outcome ; all other participants were classified as not having the outcome . 129 130 Primary and secondary exposures : 131 The primary exposure was the presence of any children under 18 years of age living in 132 participants’ household . Secondary exposures were the number of persons living in a 133 household ( 1 , 2 - 3 , more than 4 ) and the type of property in which the participant lived . 134 Property type was classified as either a multi - unit property ( e . g . apartment , 135 condominium , co - op , or building with two or more units ) , single - unit property ( e . g . 136 detached home , or townhouse ) , or other . 137 138 Covariates : .

Additionally , we included potential confounders such as 143 having had close contact with someone who had coronavirus - like symptoms and / or 144 having been involved in the diagnosis or care of someone with confirmed or suspected 145 coronavirus infection . Finally , we considered potential employment - related confounders , 146 including essential worker status , which was defined as having been involved in 147 following roles in the two weeks prior to survey date : healthcare , law enforcement , fire 148 department / first responder , delivery or pick - up services related to food or medications , 149 or in public / private transportation . 150 151 Community transmission : 152 As community transmission could confound the exposure - outcome relationship , we 153 used lagged population - based , county - level death rates as a proxy for community 154 transmission . We tabulated the number of COVID deaths per 100 , 000 population for 155 each county using data from the New York Times Github website ( from 01 / 21 / 2020 to 156 07 / 05 / 2020 ) . 26 Our proxy for community SARS - CoV - 2 transmission was a 5 - day moving 157 average of COVID deaths per 100 , 000 population , lagged by 23 days . Specifically , to 158 use county death rates as a proxy for community transmission in the county , we 159 introduced a lag since COVID deaths follow several other milestones after infection 160 ( infection→ incubation→ symptoms→ progression / hospitalization→ death ) . We 161 assumed that data on the number of deaths for a given day represented community .

All measures were dichotomized as “yes” and “no” with 179 those who reported “do not know” or ”not sure” were classified as a “no” . 180 181 Comorbid conditions 182 Participants were asked whether they have been told by a health professional that they 183 had heart attack , angina or coronary heart disease , type 2 diabetes , high blood .

Frequencies were generated for all 191 categorical variables and Pearson’s chi - squared test of independence was performed to 192 assess group differences . 193 194 A multivariable logistic regression model was used to estimate the association between 195 presence of children in households , number of people living in a household , and 196 property types on the risk of hospitalization with COVID symptoms . We ran three 197 models , all adjusted for age , gender , race / ethnicity , income , close contact , essential 198 worker status , and community transmission rate . Models examining the exposures of 199 the number of people living in household and property types models were also adjusted 200 for presence of children in the household . These variables chosen were based on 201 hypothesized causal associations and confounders , and direct acyclic graphs 32 were 202 developed for each model . 203 204 Given the associations between household crowding with COVID transmission 8 , 9 , the 205 crude and multivariate associations between 1 ) presence of children in household or 2 ) 206 household size on hospitalizations due to COVID were stratified by property type .

These included socio - demographic characteristics , and health and behavioral 214 risk factors such as essential worker status , report of having comorbid conditions , and 215 whether participants were in close contact with symptomatic , suspected or confirmed 216 COVID cases . In addition , reported COVID symptoms were examined and ranked for 217 both groups . 218 219 Sensitivity analyses : 220 Three separate sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the potential impact of 221 missing data and misclassification . First , to assess the potential impact of missing 222 values of essential worker status in the initial baseline assessment , a complete case 223 analysis was performed on the participants who had completed the second version of 224 the baseline assessment and for whom essential worker status was known . Given the 225 negative impact of the COVID - 19 pandemic on care seeking ( including emergency room 226 care ) 33 , a second sensitivity analysis assessed the potential impact of excluding persons 227 with COVID symptoms who were not hospitalized in the non - hospitalized group ( i . e . , 228 differential outcome misclassification ) . For this analysis we excluded persons who 229 reported symptoms from the denominator of non - hospitalized . The third sensitivity .

For this analysis we restricted the outcome 232 to include only those who reported being hospitalized and have received a 233 laboratory - confirmed diagnosis for COVID . 234 235 SAS version 9 . 4 ( SAS Institute , Cary , NC ) was used for all statistical analyses . 236 237 Results : 238 A total of 6 , 831 participants completed cohort screening , including 5 , 348 ( 78 % ) who 239 completed the second version of the assessment with the question on essential 240 workers . 241 242 COVID - like illness outcomes : 243 Between March 28 , 2020 and April 20 , 2020 , 58 . 5 % of the study population reported 244 symptoms in the two weeks prior to their study interview , with 25 . 7 % ( n = 1754 ) of those 245 meeting the case definition for COVID - like illness 31 ( Figure 1 ) . Twelve percent ( n = 820 ) 246 of the study population reported seeing a healthcare provider for these symptoms , 7 . 6 % 247 ( n = 518 ) sought SARS - CoV - 2 testing but did not receive it , 5 . 2 % ( n = 357 ) received a 248 diagnostic test , 2 . 8 % ( n = 188 ) received a laboratory confirmed diagnosis of coronavirus , 249 and 2 . 8 % ( n = 191 ) reported being hospitalized for COVID - like symptoms ( 69 . 6 % 250 ( n = 133 ) of whom reported laboratory confirmation of their diagnosis , and were 251 considered ‘confirmed’ ) . 252 .

Participants who completed the second version of the assessment were 258 similar to those who completed the first ( data not shown ) . 259 260 Multivariate analysis : 261 Compared to participants without children in the home , those with children had 4 . 99 262 times the adjusted odds ( 95 % CI : 3 . 16 – 7 . 89 ) in being hospitalized for COVID symptoms 263 ( Table 2 ) . No associations were observed between households with more than four 264 persons and hospitalization for COVID symptoms ( aOR : 1 . 11 ; 95 % CI : 0 . 49 – 2 . 47 ) 265 compared to one - person households .

Hospitalized participants were more likely to 283 report a comorbid condition ( 85 . 4 % vs 31 . 7 % ) and to have had contact with a 284 symptomatic case or suspected or confirmed case ( 76 . 4 % vs 14 . 2 % ) . They were also 285 more likely to be essential workers ( 80 . 1 % vs 17 . 1 % ) . Fever and sore throat were the 286 two most commonly reported symptoms which were reported by 71 . 7 % and 70 . 2 % of 287 participants , respectively . About 76 . 4 % of hospitalized participants received a test , and 288 69 . 6 % of them received a laboratory - confirmed diagnosis . 289 290 Discussion 291 Our study suggests that certain household exposures at the beginning of the 292 SARS - CoV - 2 pandemic in the US not only increased the risk of SARS - CoV - 2 293 acquisition , but also increased the risk of severe COVID - 19 disease , requiring 294 hospitalization . Household crowding and having children in the home were both strong 295 and independent risk factors for being hospitalized with SARS - CoV - 2 early in the US 296 pandemic . Our findings have implications for public health recommendations in areas 297 and during times where the risk of household transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 may be .

Essential workers , families with children , and those living in crowded indoor 301 settings may be at particularly high risk for being hospitalized with SARS - CoV - 2 , and 302 tailored recommendations to reduce the risk of household transmission are needed 303 when community transmission is high . 304 305 Household transmission occurs rapidly after an index case introduces the infection and 306 with high household attack rates , can originate from both children and adults 19 , and are 307 associated with high rates of hospitalization and death . 2 , 5 , 6 308 309 Early in the US pandemic , even when mask use was recommended and became the 310 norm outside the home , and even in areas where stay at home orders had been put in 311 place , mask use inside the home or other at - home risk mitigation measures were not 312 recommended except in situations where there were ill / infected persons ( when 10 - 14 313 days of isolation using a separate bedroom and bathroom was recommended to reduce 314 household transmission ) . However , because of household crowding , a lack of space in 315 the households , or a need to go to work , provide childcare , or care for other 316 household / family measures , isolation of ill / infected persons and quarantine of those who 317 have had a high risk exposure ( e . g . , to a confirmed case ) is not always feasible , and 318 other risk mitigation measures ( e . g . , mask wearing , opening windows ) are therefore 319 needed . 320 .

Given this , the high attack rates of 334 SARS - CoV - 2 within households , and the higher severity of SARS - CoV - 2 infections that 335 can result from prolonged unmasked , indoor exposures when entire households are 336 quarantined , public health officials should consider recommending mask use and other 337 risk mitigation strategies ( e . g . , open windows , reduced close contact , frequent at - home 338 testing ) in all households with more than one person for a period of time immediately 339 before and after stay at home orders go into effect . 340 341 Essential workers have several potential risks for SARS - CoV - 2 infection , including 342 commuting and exposure while at work , but they also may be at higher risk for acquiring 343 or transmitting infection at home as well .

Essential workers with young children need 351 childcare , which could put their children at risk of infection . Children with SARS - CoV - 2 352 infection have high enough viral load to transmit to others , and may be more likely to 353 have unrecognized infections . When children become ill , isolation may be even more 354 challenging than for adults , and adults providing care for them are at higher risk , 355 possibly of a more severe SARS - CoV - 2 infection , especially when it is difficult to follow 356 infection control practices , such as mask wearing at home by all household members . 357 358 Our study has limitations worth noting . First , this was not a household transmission 359 study , and therefore we could not pinpoint household transmission as the likely source 360 of the infection that resulted in infection and hospitalization among our study 361 participants . We therefore cannot say whether and the extent to which household 362 transmission occurred , and if it did , when a child in the household was the source of 363 infection to our study participants . We also did not assess participants’ mask use at 364 home . Finally , while we controlled for several possible confounders of the association of 365 household crowding and children in the home with SARS - CoV - 2 risk , unmeasured 366 confounding could partially explain our observed associations . .

As a large epidemiologic cohort study , it was 369 possible to examine the association of several potentially important household - level risk 370 factors with a relatively rare outcome of SARS - CoV - 2 hospitalization , while controlling 371 for potential confounding factors . We also had a geographically diverse sample that 372 included several essential workers . Finally , our findings were robust to the three 373 sensitivity analyses , which generated similar findings to the main analysis . 374 375 Conclusions 376 Early in the US SARS - CoV - 2 pandemic , certain household exposures likely increased 377 the risk of both SARS - CoV - 2 acquisition and the risk of severe COVID - 19 disease 378 requiring hospitalization . These findings may have implications for mask wearing and 379 other mitigation strategies at home immediately prior to and immediately after ‘stay at 380 home’ orders go into effect . 381 382 Funding 383 Funding for this project is provided by the CUNY Institute for Implementation Science in 384 Population Health ( cunyisph . org ) , the COVID - 19 Grant Program of the CUNY Graduate 385 School of Public Health and Health Policy , and the National Institute Of Allergy and 386 Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Health under Award Number 387 UH3AI133675 . 388 Acknowledgements .
