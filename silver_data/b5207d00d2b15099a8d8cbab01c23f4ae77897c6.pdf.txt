Introduction The large majority of scientific publications arguably cover only a small incremental advance over the pre - existing body of scientific knowledge and have little influence on later scientific progress . Only a small minority of scientific publications introduces fundamentally new scientific insights . Nevertheless , it is hard to overstate the importance of new scientific discoveries such as the transistor , magnetic resonance imaging , polymerase chain reaction or carbon nanotubes . New scientific ideas build upon prior knowledge and ideas , serve as the foundation for future scientific and technological advancements , and catalyze economic growth and societal welfare ( Bush , 1945 ; Nelson & Winter , 1982 ; Weitzman , 1998 ) . Despite the importance of new scientific ideas , scholars face difficulties to identify and trace the origin of new scientific ideas and to follow their diffusion and impact . To measure the novelty of scientific papers and its impact , prior and current work has traditionally relied on citations to prior papers ( Uzzi et al . , 2013 ; Wang et al . , 2017 ; Veugelers & Wang , 2019 ; Wu et al . , 2019 ) . Yet , this approach has important limitations . Citations only capture prior art but not the scientific content and contribution of the paper itself . Thus , citations presumably cannot accurately identify new scientific ideas − and measure the novelty − in the content of a paper . Moreover , citations may not always reflect prior art and intellectual impact or influence . Surveying 9 , 000 academics from 15 different fields , Teplitskiy et al . ( 2022 ) illustrate that more than half of cited papers actually had either a minor or very minor intellectual influence . In this paper , we circumvent the use of citations altogether and build on the seminal work on scientific revolutions of Kuhn ( 1970 ) in which he argues that scientific ideas are embedded in the text of scientific articles , and therefore new scientific ideas can only be identified through shifts in language ( Kaplan & Vakili , 2015 ) . We use Natural language processing ( NLP ) techniques to harness the text of scientific publications and identify both the origin and the impact of new scientific ideas . Prior work started to explore the use of NLP to detect new scientific ideas in the text of scientific publications ( e . g . Azoulay et al . 2011 ; Boudreau et al . , 2016 ; Iara et al . , 2018 ; Chai & Menon , 2019 ; Cheng et al . , 2023 ) . But , this stream of research still has a number of shortcomings . First , prior work generally provides no large scale validation of the proposed text metrics . Second , it remains unclear which text metrics to adopt and whether text metrics provide an advancement over the traditional metrics based on paper citations . Finally , prior work provides no open access to data and new metrics . Given the effort and complexity to harness ( almost ) the entire corpus of scientific work 3 published in history , open access to data and new metrics could arguably foster the adoption of text metrics by a broader community of scholars . The current manuscript aims to fill these gaps in the literature . We use the titles and abstracts of all scientific publications covered in the latest version of Microsoft Academic Graph ( MAG ) . MAG arguably covers the largest corpus of scientific work published in the entire history from 1780 until 2020 . It has a broader coverage than the Web of Science or Scopus , and has the key advantage of being open access ( Martín - Martín et al . , 2021 ; Lin et al . , 2023 ) . To detect new scientific ideas and measure the novelty of a paper at the time of publication , we identify unigrams ( keywords ) , bigrams ( two consecutive words ) , trigrams ( three consecutive words ) , and pairwise keyword combinations that appear for the first time in history in the title or abstract of a scientific paper ( Arts et al . , 2021 ) . For instance , we identify the first paper in history introducing “ transistor ” 1 , “ confocal microscopy ” 2 , “ polymerase chain reaction ” 3 , or the pairwise word combination of “ carbon” and “nanotube ” 4 . Alternatively , we measure the novelty of scientific papers based on the content similarity with prior papers . To do so , we use SPECTER , a pre - trained document - level embedding of scientific documents , which has the advantage of being able to accounts for synonyms , polysemy , and the context of words ( Cohan et al . , 2020 ; Erhardt et al . , 2022 ) . To measure the impact or influence of new scientific ideas , we count the number of papers reusing the new keywords , bigrams , trigrams , or keyword combinations . For instance , 152 , 047 papers reuse “ transistor ” , 43 , 785 papers reuse “ confocal microscopy ” , 209 , 968 papers reuse “ polymerase chain reaction ” , and 131 , 888 papers reuse the pairwise word combination of “ carbon ” and “ nanotube ” . To validate the text metrics and their improvement over traditional measures based on citations , we employ case - control study designs . First and foremost , we collect scientific publications linked to the Nobel Prize in Physics , Medicine , and Biology from Li et al . ( 2019 ) . These papers likely introduced fundamentally new scientific ideas with a major impact on scientific progress . The Nobel Prize offers a key advantage for validation as it allows us the assess whether our text metrics designed for identifying novel scientific ideas in 1 Bardeen , J . , & Brattain , W . H .

Nature , 354 ( 6348 ) , 56 - 58 . 4 the full population of scientific articles align with the scientific contributions described in the prize motivation on the official Nobel prize website . As a second validation and robustness check , we collect literature review papers which generally should summarize prior scientific findings rather than pioneering new scientific ideas themselves . Finally , as an application of the new metrics , we collect top cited papers and test whether papers pioneering new scientific ideas are more likely to become highly cited . The validation studies support the use of NLP to identify new scientific ideas and measure the novelty of papers at the time of publication , and to measure the influence and impact of these new ideas on later scientific work . Moreover , the results illustrate the improvement of the new text metrics over the traditional metrics based on paper citations . Interestingly , the new text measures only weakly correlate with the traditional novelty measures based on paper citations . To facilitate further research , we provide open access to all our data ( https : / / zenodo . org / record / 8283353 , DOI : 10 . 5281 / zenodo . 8283353 ) and code ( https : / / github . com / nicolamelluso / science - novelty ) . 2 . Identifying the Origin and Impact of New Scientific Ideas using Text 2 . 1 Data collection We collect all publications from the latest version of Microsoft Academic Graph ( MAG ) , dated 06 . 12 . 2021 via Azure Data Share ( Sinha et al . , 2015 ) . 5 MAG contains about 270 , 000 , 000 records including books , book chapters , conference proceedings , datasets , journal articles , papers , repositories , theses and preprints . We restrict the sample to journal publications and published conference proceedings ( 103 , 117 , 246 records ) , referred to as “publications” in the remainder of the paper . We remove 3 , 571 , 940 publications with duplicate titles , abstracts or Digital Object Identifiers ( DOI ) , 5 , 838 , 367 publications with non - English source 6 , 11 , 881 , 805 publications with a non - English title , 3 , 303 , 938 publications with a non - English abstract 7 , and 29 , 320 records of retracted publications . In addition , we face two significant issues concerning the publication date in MAG . First , for 16 , 267 , 071 publications which report the 1 st of January as date of publication , the exact day of publication may be unclear . Given that this is a significant share of the sample , we double check these publication dates with both CrossRef and Scopus using the DOI of the publication ( Martín - Martín et al . , 2021 ; Visser et al . , 2021 ) . 63 % of MAG records with 1st 5 Microsoft ( 2022 ) , Microsoft Academic Graph , URL : https : / / www . microsoft . com / en - us / research / project / microsoft - academic - graph / , last accessed 31 . 10 . 2022 6 For non - English sources , we use the language information about the URL , where the record is retrieved , available in MAG’s Table ‘Paper Urls’ from the official data schema . 7 We use fasttext , a language detection python package to determine the language of the record ( Joulin et al . , 2016 ) . 5 January as publication date have no DOI and cannot be matched to either CrossRef or Scopus . Among the matched records , 87 % also have the 1st of January as publication date in CrossRef or Scopus while the remaining 13 % have a different date . We keep the 1 st of January as date of publication in case of agreement between MAG and CrossRef or Scopus . In case of disagreement , we replace the publication date in MAG with the publication date in Scopus and / or CrossRef . In case of disagreement between Scopus and CrossRef , we use the publication date from CrossRef , which turned out to be more accurate after a manual inspection of a randomly selected sample of 100 papers . Finally , we remove the publications that exist only in MAG ( and not in CrossRef or Scopus ) with the indicative publication date as 1st January , due to the uncertainty in their publication date . The second issue with the recorded dates in MAG is that there is both an ‘online’ date and a publication in print date that are not necessarily the same . Publications are made available online on the publisher’s website before the date of the print issue or after the date of the print issue for older publications . We take the earliest date as the date of publication because this date is the closest to the scientific discovery . Next , we process the title and abstracts of these publications . For every publication , the abstract is only available as an inverted index in MAG , which we convert back to the original abstract 8 . Next , we concatenate title and abstract . Because there is only a title and no abstract available for 29 % of the publications , we illustrate in the online appendix the robustness of all metrics and findings in case we discard abstracts and exclusively rely on titles . Next , we process the text with the following steps : tokenization , lemmatization , stop word removal , chunking , baseline removal , and vectorization . First , we lowercase the text and tokenize it to words ( or unigrams ) 9 . Second , we apply lemmatization to each word using the WordNetLemmatizer from the NLTK library in Python so that we are left with a collection of lemmas representing the scientific content of the publication . Third , we remove : natural stop words 10 , a manually compiled list of 33 , 764 very common words unrelated to the scientific 8 Inverted indexes store information about each word in a body of text , i . e . they map the content of the body of text to their relative location . This includes the number of occurrences a word is found and its position of occurrence . 9 We use the following regular expression : [ a - z0 - 9 ] [ a - z0 - 9 - ] * [ a - z0 - 9 ] + | [ a - z0 - 9 ] to tokenize the text . 10 We remove all stop words which we define as : ( i ) numbers or words referring to numbers written in full ( i . e . one , two , etc . ) ; ( ii ) single character words ; ( iii ) natural stop words collected from the NLTK Python library ( 127 words ) , natural stop words collected from Gensim Python library ( 337 words ) , natural stop words collected from Spacy Python library ( 326 words ) ( Srinivasa - Desikan , B . , 2018 ) ( iv ) words referring to days and months ( i . e . Monday , July , etc . ) ; and ( vi ) words referring to cities ( i . e . New York , London , etc . ) , countries ( i . e . USA , Europe , etc . ) , first names ( i . e . John , Marie , etc . ) and institutions ( i . e . Nasa , Yale , etc . ) retrieved from Wikidata ( 8 , 570 words ) . 6 content of a publication 11 , words composed only by numbers , one character words and punctuations . The final list of removed stop words consists of 67 , 150 words . In addition , for each publication , we perform chunking by extracting bigrams ( two consecutive words ) and trigrams ( three consecutive words ) . For bigrams we keep the ones without any stop word and for trigrams we only keep those without any stop word or with a stop word in the middle of the trigram . Finally , we create a vector representation of the scientific content ( title and abstract not processed ) of every publication using SPECTER , a pre - trained document - level embedding of scientific documents that is pretrained on a Transformer language model tailored to scientific text . SPECTER is currently arguably the best performing document - level embedding of scientific papers and outperforms other embedding models such as doc2vec or SciBERT on different benchmark tasks . For every publication , we create a vector of 768 dimensions using Huggingface Transformers Library 12 and the instructions from the open source repository of the model ( Wolf et al . , 2019 ) . 13 In the remainder of the paper , we use all publications published between 1880 and 1900 to construct a baseline dictionary and restrict the analysis to papers published between 1901 and 2020 ( n = 72 , 245 , 396 ) . The entire cleaned vocabulary contains 20 , 953 , 136 unique unigrams ( keywords ) , 114 , 939 , 991 unique bigrams , and 341 , 735 , 389 unique trigrams . The average and median number of unique keywords per publication is 33 and 32 , the average and median number of unique bigrams per publication is 15 and 13 , and the average and median number of unique trigrams per publication is 14 and 11 . 2 . 2 Text metrics for novelty First , we calculate new _ word as the number of unique unigrams ( keywords ) of a paper that appear for the first time in history and that are reused at least once in future publications . Papers published between 1880 and 1900 are used as a baseline dictionary . Hence , we identify the first paper using keywords such as “ transistor ” 14 , “ positron ” 15 , “ fullerene ” 16 , 11 We compile a list with the most frequently occurring words in publications . Using an iterative approach where three people independently review this list , we identify and exclude ( i ) non - scientific keywords unrelated to the scientific content of papers ( e . g . , abstract , university , journal , publication ) ; and ( ii ) mistakenly combined words resulting from the tokenization process ( e . g . , improvementthat , includeoper ) . We maintain the frequently occurring keywords related to the scientific content of the publication ( e . g . , patient , chemical , virus ) . 12 https : / / huggingface . co / allenai / specter 13 https : / / github . com / allenai / specter 14 Bardeen , J . , & Brattain , W .

Nature , 329 ( 6139 ) , 529 - 531 . 7 “ photon ” 17 , and “ streptomycin ” 18 ( the first antibiotic effective against tuberculosis ) . Second , we calculate new _ bigram as the number of unique bigrams ( two consecutive words in text ) of a paper that appear for the first time in history and that are reused at least once in future publications . For instance , we identify the first paper using bigrams such as “ confocal microscopy ” 19 , “ transgenic mouse ” 20 , or “ electron tunneling ” 21 . Third , we compute new _ trigram as the number of unique trigrams ( three consecutive words in the text ) of a paper that appear for the first time and that are reused at least once in future publications . Hence , we identify the first paper introducing trigrams such as “ scanning tunnel microscopy ” 22 , “ polymerase chain reaction ” 23 or “ tandem mass spectrometry ” 24 . Fourth , we compute new _ word _ comb as the count of unique pairwise keyword combinations of a paper that appear for the first time in history and that are reused at least once in future publications . To do so , we first calculate all possible pairwise combinations between any of the keywords of a paper . Contrary to bigrams and trigrams , the location and order of the keywords in the paper does not matter . For instance , we identify the first paper using keyword combinations such as “ carbon nanotube ” 25 , “ acid prostaglandin ” 26 , “ age radiocarbon ” 27 , or “ x - ray diffraction ” 28 . Finally , we use the SPECTER document - embedding vector of every paper in MAG and calculate the pairwise cosine similarity between each focal paper and every prior paper published in the preceding 5 years . We calculate cosine _ max as one minus the maximum cosine similarity between the focal paper and all prior papers . Thus , this measure reflects the semantic distance between the focal paper and the prior paper from the entire population in the previous five years that is closest in scientific content to the focal paper . Alternatively , we calculate cosine _ avg as one minus the average pairwise cosine similarity 17 Lewis , G . N . ( 1926 ) . The conservation of photons .

Hence , this measure reflects the average semantic distance between the focal paper and all prior papers from the entire population in the previous 5 years 29 . Papers which score among the highest ( top 1 % ) on cosine _ max or cosine _ avg include the paper 30 linked to the 1983 Nobel prize in Medicine awarded to Barbara McClintock for the discovery of mobile genetic elements or the 1976 paper 31 by Leon Chua on memristors . 2 . 3 Text metrics for impact of new scientific ideas To measure the impact or influence of the new scientific ideas on subsequent scientific work , we look at the number of times the new ideas introduced by the paper for the first time are being reused in the text of subsequent publications , which arguably captures the impact or influence of the new scientific ideas on subsequent scientific papers . First , we compute new _ word _ reuse as the number of new keywords introduced by the focal paper weighted by the number of later papers that reuse these keywords . For paper p , 𝑛𝑒𝑤 _ 𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑑 _ 𝑟𝑒𝑢𝑠𝑒 𝑝 = ∑ ( 1 + 𝑢 𝑖 ) 𝑛𝑖 = 1 with n equal to the number of new keywords introduced by paper p and 𝑢 𝑖 equal to the number of future papers which reuse the new keyword i . For instance , 152 , 047 publications reuse the keyword “ transistor ” , 32 , 305 reuse “ fullerene ” and 94 , 146 publications reuse the keyword “ positron ” . While new _ word measures the novelty of a paper at the time of publication , new _ word _ reuse measures the extent to which the new scientific ideas introduced by the focal paper influence subsequent scientific work . Second , we calculate new _ bigram _ reuse as the number of new bigrams introduced by the focal paper weighted by the number of subsequent papers which reuse these particular bigrams , which arguably reflects the impact of the new scientific ideas on subsequent scientific papers . For instance , 43 , 785 papers reuse bigram “ confocal microscopy ” and 4 , 759 papers reuse bigram “ electron tunneling ” . Third , we calculate new _ trigram _ reuse as the number of new trigrams introduced by the focal paper weighted by the number of subsequent papers which reuse these trigrams . For instance , 209 , 968 papers reuse “ polymerase chain reaction ” and 17 , 914 papers reuse “ scanning tunnel microscopy ” . Finally , we compute new _ word _ comb _ reuse as the number of 29 This measure might be influenced by the unavailability of abstracts . The text length , altered due to this absence , could potentially impact the creation of the embeddings and subsequent calculation of cosine similarity . When comparing a paper with an abstract to a paper without , the lack of informational content could either inflate or decrease the similarity . Nevertheless , we control for the availability of abstract in all validation exercises of this paper . 30 McClintock , B . ( 1950 ) . The origin and behavior of mutable loci in maize . Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , 36 ( 6 ) , 344 - 355 . 31 Chua , L . O . , & Kang , S . M . ( 1976 ) . Memristive devices and systems . Proceedings of the IEEE , 64 ( 2 ) , 209 - 223 . 9 new keyword combinations weighted by the number of subsequent papers that reuse these keyword combinations , which arguably reflects the diffusion and influence of the new scientific ideas . For instance , 131 , 888 papers reuse “ carbon nanotube ” , 519 , 239 papers reuse “ x - ray diffraction ” and 8 , 679 papers reuse “ age radiocarbon ” . Interestingly , we find that papers reusing new keywords are approximately 53 times more likely to cite the paper which introduced the keyword for the first time compared to a matched control group of papers from the same journal , year , volume and issue that do not reuse the new keyword ( 0 . 954 % versus 0 . 018 % ) . 32 Similarly , for papers reusing new keyword combinations , we find that they are approximately 20 times more likely ( 0 . 386 % versus 0 . 019 % ) to cite the paper pioneering the new keyword combination relative to their matched control group . 33 Nevertheless , the overall rate of citation among papers reusing new scientific ideas is very low . Scientific papers generally tend to cite only the most recent scientific papers , and not necessarily the older foundational papers that pioneered a new scientific insight that they directly or indirectly build on . Indeed , among the papers reusing new keywords within the first 5 , 20 , or 50 years after the publication of the paper introducing the new keyword , respectively 18 . 0 % , 6 . 7 % , and 2 . 0 % cite the paper pioneering the new keyword . In parallel , among the papers reusing new keyword combinations within the first 5 , 20 , or 50 years after the publication of the paper introducing the new combination , respectively 6 . 6 % , 2 . 8 % , and 0 . 9 % cite the paper pioneering the new keyword combinations . These findings signify that citations and the reuse of scientific ideas have to be treated as different observables . 2 . 4 Traditional ( citation - based ) metrics for novelty Prior and current research traditionally relies on paper citations to measure the novelty of a paper . We calculate the most commonly used citation - based novelty metrics and compare their performance to our new text measures . First , Uzzi et al . ( 2013 ) define novelty as an atypical combination of prior knowledge . We follow Uzzi et al . ( 2013 ) and compare the observed frequency of any pair of cited journals and the frequency of that pair of cited 32 We randomly sample 10 , 000 new keywords that are reused at least 10 times by subsequent papers and identify the 1 , 903 , 819 papers reusing these new keywords . We match each of the 1 , 903 , 819 reusing papers to one randomly selected paper that does not reuse the specific new keyword but is published in the same journal , year , volume and issue as the paper that reuses the keyword . In case the journal issue is not available , we match on journal , year and volume . In case the journal volume is not available , we match on journal and year . 33 In parallel , we randomly sample 10 , 000 new keyword combinations that are reused at least 10 times by subsequent papers and identify the 1 , 260 , 854 papers reusing these new keyword combinations . We match each of the 1 , 260 , 854 reusing papers to one randomly selected paper that does not reuse the specific new keyword combination but is published in the same journal , year , volume and issue as the paper that reuses the keyword combination . In case the journal issue is not available , we match on journal , year and volume . In case the journal volume is not available , we match on journal and year . 10 journals that would have occurred by chance using a Configuration Null Model ( Bollobás , 1998 ) , creating a normalized z - score that measures for any pair of cited journals the ( a ) typicality . Next , we calculate for each focal paper uzzi as the 10 th percentile of the z - scores for all pairs of journals cited by the focal paper , i . e . focusing on the most novel or atypical combinations introduced by the focal paper . Lower values of uzzi indicate more novel papers and higher values of uzzi indicate less novel papers . Second , Wang et al . ( 2017 ) define novelty of a focal paper as the sum of the distance of first - time ever combinations of journals of the cited papers . We follow their approach and first identify all pairs of journals cited together for the first time in history . Next , we calculate the distance for each new pair of cited journals based on their co - citation frequency . Finally , we calculate wang as the sum of the distance for new combinations of cited journals . 34 A paper scores higher on wang in case the paper makes more new combinations of cited journals and in case the distance between the new cited journal pairs is higher . 35 Finally , Funk & Owen - Smith ( 2017 ) introduce a metric that characterizes if a paper is disruptive or consolidating ( Wu et al . , 2019 ; Park et al . , 2023 ) . A focal paper is assumed to be more disruptive if the papers that cite the focal paper do not cite the focal paper’s predecessors , i . e . the papers cited by the focal paper . A paper is considered consolidating if it is mostly cited together with its predecessors . In contrast to uzzi and wang , cd is not a direct measure for the novelty of a paper , but a measure of the nature of its impact , where the assumption would be that novel papers are more likely to disrupt citation patterns and papers that disrupt citation patterns are more likely to be novel . Another limitation of the cd index is that it cannot identify the novelty of a paper at the time of publication ( ex - ante ) . In contrast to uzzi and wang , cd also uses citations received from later papers and is as such conditional on the impact or influence of the focal paper on subsequent scientific papers . Using information from later papers to assess novelty at the time of publication might cause spurious correlation between novelty and impact . To assess the novelty of a paper , one arguably should exclusively rely on information available at the time of publication , i . e . comparing a paper with all prior art available at the time of publication . We nonetheless include the measure in our analyses given its increasing use in the science of science community ( e . g . Wu et al . , 34 We closely follow Wang et al . ( 2017 ) and only consider the most important journal combinations , excluding the 50 percent least cited journals ( based on the number of citations in the preceding three years received by all their publications starting from 20 years prior to the paper ) . Furthermore , to ensure that the new combination is not trivial , we also impose a condition that the new combination must be reused at least once in the next three years 35 Papers making many references are more likely to score on wang , calling for controlling for the number of references when using wang . Fontana et al . ( 2020 ) show that the wang metric needs to be considered relative to the likelihood of combinations being made . . 11 2019 ; Park et al . , 2023 ) . But in line with the authors we interpret it as a measure for the type of impact , being disruptive or not , which is associated with novelty , but not as a direct ex ante measure of novelty ( Leahey et al . , 2023 ) . We used the authors’ open access python package cdindex 36 to calculate cd . 3 . Descriptive Statistics 3 . 1 New ngrams or word combinations Table 1 shows the summary statistics at the level of new ngrams or word combinations identified in all papers published between 1901 and 2020 . Overall , 7 , 305 , 080 new keywords , 32 , 104 , 336 new bigrams , 75 , 573 , 271 new trigrams and about 1 . 1 billions new word combinations have been introduced since 1901 . As expected , the impact as measured by reuse is very skewed . Most new ngrams or word combinations are reused by only a few subsequent papers , but a small minority are reused extensively . The most impactful in the entire history of scientific publishing include the word “ transistor ” 37 pioneered in 1948 and reused by 152 , 047 publications , the bigram “ confocal microscopy ” 38 appearing for the first time in 1981 and reused by 43 , 785 papers , the new trigram “polymerase chain reaction” 39 emerging in 1986 and reused by 209 , 968 papers , and the new word combination “ carbon nanotube ” 40 originating in 1991 and reused by 131 , 888 papers . ‘Table 1’ 3 . 2 Novelty at paper level Table 2 displays summary statistics at the paper level for all papers in our sample . Only a limited set of papers score on novelty . Around 7 . 9 % of all papers introduce at least one new keyword , 27 . 4 % at least one new bigram , 46 . 9 % at least one new trigram and around 51 . 7 % at least one new word combination . The average ( median ) paper introduces 0 . 1 ( 0 ) new words , 0 . 4 ( 0 ) new bigrams , 1 . 0 ( 0 ) new trigrams , and 15 . 6 ( 1 ) new word combinations . As expected , there is little variance among papers in terms of cosine _ avg . Table A . 9 in Appendix displays summary statistics for the subsample of papers that introduce at least one new ngram or word combination .

While the number of new word combinations might seem large , notice that the average paper has 858 unique keyword pairs so that the average and median share of new word combinations per paper is only 1 . 8 % and 0 . 1 % respectively . As expected , the descriptive statistics illustrate the large skew for all text - based novelty metrics at the paper - level , and show the importance to control for the text length and number of words when analyzing the novelty of a paper . ‘Table 2’ We should expect a large heterogeneity in the occurrence of scientific novelty across different fields of study and over time . As an illustration , Figure 1 displays the average number of new word combinations pioneered by papers from 1901 to 2020 for all fields of study . 41 As expected , the figure shows considerable variation across different fields and years . For example , fields such as Biology , Chemistry or Physics show the highest rate of scientific novelty compared to other fields . The time trends also highlight the historical evolution of scientific fields . For example , many new scientific discoveries emerged in Computer Science after 1960 . The large heterogeneity in scientific novelty is persistent at the more granular subfield level . As an example , Figure 2 displays the same graph for a sample of subfields of Physics . One can see a surge in scientific novelty in Quantum Mechanics and Atomic Physics around 1930 and 1940 that corresponds to the birth of modern physics and the subsequent scientific progress in Astrophysics that started in the 1950s . These figures underscore the importance of controlling for the ( sub ) field and the year of publication when assessing the novelty of a paper . ‘Figures 1 & 2’ As expected and illustrated in Table A . 1 in Appendix , there is a relatively high correlation between the different text - based novelty metrics , suggesting that papers introducing new scientific ideas typically score on multiple text metrics simultaneously . Table 3 below further illustrates this finding using the binary versions of the different metrics . For example , among all papers introducing a new word , 61 % also introduce a new bigram , 75 % a new trigram , and 90 % a new word combination . This result reinforces the observation that the novelty introduced by a paper is often simultaneously captured by 41 We use the enhanced version of the field of study classification of MAG papers from Färber & Ao ( 2022 ) , and as such our results depend on the performance of this approach to assign papers to the right field . Using the field classification of Web of Science or Scopus might render different results ( Martín - Martín et al . , 2021 ) . 13 different alternative text metrics . Because of this high co - occurrence , we construct an additional binary indicator new _ gram _ bin equal to 1 for papers introducing a new word and / or new bigram and / or new trigram . There is also a high co - occurrence between new _ gram _ bin and new _ word _ comb _ bin . Among all papers introducing a new ngram , 75 % also introduce a new word combination . Conversely , among all papers introducing a new word combination , 79 % also introduce a new ngram . One might suspect that the correlation between the novelty metrics is positive by construction in case new words inflate the number of new bigrams , trigrams , or new word combinations , or when new bigrams inflate the number of new trigrams . However , among all bigrams introduced by papers between 1901 and 2020 , only 6 . 9 % include a new word , among all trigrams only 8 . 8 % include a new word or a new bigram , and among all new word combinations only 7 . 1 % include a new word . As such , the number of new bigrams , trigrams and new word combinations of a paper do not change significantly after excluding those with overlapping ngrams . Moreover , our main findings do not change if we use the exclusive categories . 42 Future users of our data can easily use exclusive categories if they prefer this approach . ‘Table 3’ Interestingly , our descriptive statistics suggests that text mining differently measures the novelty of papers compared to the traditional approach based on paper citations . The average correlations between our new text based measures for novelty and the traditional citation - based novelty metrics ( i . e . uzzi , wang and cd ) are low ( Table A . 1 in the appendix ) . For instance , among the papers without any new ngrams or word combinations , respectively 4 . 5 % and 4 . 8 % would be considered as novel by wang and uzzi . 43 3 . 3 Paper level impact of novelty Finally , we look at summary statistics for the metrics accounting for the impact of new scientific ideas as measured by their reuse in later publications . As show in Table 2 , the average ( median ) value for new _ word _ reuse is 7 . 7 ( 0 ) , for new _ bigram _ reuse 12 . 2 ( 0 ) , for new _ trigram _ reuse 9 . 4 ( 0 ) , and for new _ word _ comb _ reuse 776 ( 2 ) . As shown in Table A . 9 in Appendix , the average ( median ) value for papers with at least one new word , bigram , trigram , or new word combination for new _ word _ reuse is 98 . 5 ( 4 ) , for new _ bigram _ reuse 44 . 6 ( 4 ) , for new _ trigram _ reuse 20 . 1 ( 5 ) , and for new _ word _ comb _ reuse 1 , 502 ( 51 ) . The 42 Descriptive statistics and regression results not displayed but available from the authors . 43 Papers with wang > 0 and uzzi < 0 could be considered as novel or atypical according to these metrics . 14 descriptive statistics again illustrate the very large skew in the reuse of new scientific ideas , with only a small fraction of novel papers being very impactful . 4 . Nobel Prize Papers To validate whether the new text metrics can identify new scientific ideas and measure the influence of these ideas on later scientific work , we look at Nobel prize papers . Nobel prize papers arguably pioneered new scientific ideas , and especially new ideas with a major impact on later scientific progress and publishing . As a first validation exercise , we webscrape the motivation for each prize from the Nobel prize committee website which includes a clear rationale of the specific contributions made by the laureates to their respective fields . This allows us to test whether applying our text metrics designed for identifying novel scientific ideas in the full population of scientific articles to Nobel prize papers correspond with the scientific contributions described in the prize motivation from the Nobel prize committee . As a second validation , we use a case - control study design and test the ability of all text and traditional citation - based metrics to correctly distinguish the Nobel prize papers from carefully matched control papers . Our key assumption is that Nobel prize papers are more likely to introduce new scientific ideas , and particularly new ideas with a major impact on later scientific papers relative to the matched control papers . 4 . 1 Data We collect publications linked to Nobel prizes in Chemistry , Physics and Physiology or Medicine from Li et al . ( 2019 ) . Nobel prize papers refer to the specific scientific publications that have been recognized by the Nobel prize committee as significant contributions to their respective fields and have led to the awarding of a Nobel Prize to at least one of the co - authors . Next , we match each Nobel prize paper to one control paper not linked to any Nobel prize but published in the same year , journal , volume and issue as the Nobel prize paper . In case of multiple matching control papers , we randomly sample one 44 . Matching on journal , year , volume and issue arguably controls for differences across scientific fields and time . Our sample includes 501 Nobel prize papers published between 1906 and 2010 linked to 220 Nobel prizes awarded between 1912 and 2016 45 . Together , these Nobel prize papers introduced 226 new words , 938 new bigrams , 1 , 628 new trigrams and 40 , 052 new keyword 44 In case the journal issue of the Nobel prize publication is not available , we match on journal , year and volume . In case the journal volume of the Nobel prize publication is not available , we match on journal and year . 45 144 papers linked to Nobel prizes in Chemistry , 148 papers linked to Nobel prizes in Physics , and 209 papers linked to Nobel prizes in physiology or Medicine 15 combinations . For each Nobel prize award , we download the online summary page that describes the award , the short motivation for the prize and a summary of the scientific contribution for which the laureates obtained the prize . We process the text of each award page following the exact same procedure adopted for publications ( see above ) 46 . Reassuringly , we find that 100 % of the new words , 87 % of the new bigrams , 86 % of the new trigrams and 86 % of new word combinations pioneered by Nobel prize papers are also mentioned in the summary page of each corresponding Nobel prize . This finding illustrates the ability of our text metrics to identify new scientific ideas in the full population of scientific publications covered by MAG . ‘Table 4’ Table 4 provides examples of Nobel prizes , one corresponding paper , an example of a new scientific idea introduced by this paper as captured by our text metrics and also found in the Nobel prize motivation , and how the paper scores on the different text and traditional metrics . We briefly discuss some examples here . The Nobel Prize in Physics 1920 was awarded to Charles Edouard Guillaume " in recognition of the service he has rendered to precision measurements in Physics by his discovery of anomalies in nickel steel alloys " 47 . The corresponding paper published in 1909 in the Proceedings of the Physical Society of London introduces for the first time the combination of the words “ anomaly ” and “ nickel ” reused by 554 subsequent papers . William Shockley , John Bardeen , and Walter Brattain shared the 1956 Nobel prize in Physics “for their research on semiconductors and the discovery of the transistor effect” 48 . One of the corresponding papers published in 1948 in Physical Review was the first to introduce the keyword “ transistor ” , reused by 152 , 047 subsequent papers . In 1986 , Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer won the Nobel prize in Physics “for their design of the scanning tunneling microscope” 49 . The corresponding paper published in 1982 in Physical Review Letters was the first to introduce the trigram “ scanning tunnel microscopy ” , reused by 17 , 914 papers . The 1993 Nobel prize in chemistry was awarded to Kary Mullis " for his invention of the polymerase chain reaction method " . The corresponding paper published in 1986 in Cold Spring Harbor symposia on quantitative 46 On average , a Nobel prize motivation summary page contains 260 . 19 words ( std = 87 ) , 74 . 74 bigrams ( std = 43 ) and 64 . 76 trigrams ( std = 32 ) . 47 The Nobel Prize in Physics 1920 .

In 2001 , the Nobel prize in Chemistry was awarded to William Knowles and Ryoji Noyori " for their work on chirally catalysed hydrogenation reactions " 50 . The corresponding paper published in 1968 in Tetrahedron introduced for the first time the combination of the words “ chiral ” and “ synthesis ” reused by 34 , 820 papers . As a final example , The Nobel prize in Medicine 2016 was awarded to Yoshinori Ohsumi " for his discoveries of mechanisms for autophagy " 51 . The corresponding paper published in The Journal of Cell Biology in 1992 introduced for the first time the combination of “ autophagy ” and “ genetic ” , reused by 3 , 396 papers and also found in the motivation for the prize . Table 4 shows that for Nobel prize papers , our text based novelty measures are picking up the novel idea as identified in the motivation for the prize . It also illustrates that the Nobel prize papers typically score on multiple novelty text metrics . In contrast , he traditional novelty metrics based on citations ( uzzi and wang ) do not consistently capture the novelty of the Nobel prize papers . For instance , the majority of the Nobel prize papers in the table do not introduce new combinations of cited journals . To give one example , Emilio Segrè and Owen Chamberlain received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1959 " for their discovery of the antiproton " . The corresponding paper published in Physical Review in 1955 pioneered the keyword “ antiproton ” and different new word combinations , but cannot be identified with the traditional novelty measures because it has no new combinations of cited journals , nor does it exhibit an atypical pattern in its cited journal pairs , as indicated by its positive value for uzzi . 4 . 2 Descriptive results Table 5 shows descriptive statistics for Nobel prize papers compared to the matched control papers . Both the text and the traditional citation - based metrics can distinguish Nobel prize papers from control papers with a t - test significant at p = 0 . 000 . The only exceptions are wang ( significant at p = 0 . 084 ) , cosine _ max ( p = 0 . 231 ) and cosine _ avg ( p = 0 . 221 ) . All text metrics measuring novelty at the time of publication ( new _ word , new _ bigram , new _ trigram , and new _ word _ comb ) outperform the traditional novelty measures based on citations ( i . e . wang and uzzi ) in terms of both t - statistic and Cohen’s d ( i . e . mean difference between Nobel prize and control papers divided by the pooled standard deviation ) . Given that Nobel prize papers 50 The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2001 . Nobel Prize Outreach AB .

Retrieved August 2 , 2023 , from https : / / www . nobelprize . org / prizes / medicine / 2016 / summary / . 17 are arguably more likely to pioneer new scientific insights , these findings provide supportive evidence that text metrics for novelty are ( better ) able to identify new scientific ideas and measure the novelty of papers at the time of publication . Looking among all metrics for assessing the novelty of papers at the time of publication , new _ word _ comb seems to perform best in identifying Nobel prize papers . As expected , particularly the text metrics accounting for the diffusion and impact of new scientific ideas ( new _ word _ reuse , new _ bigram _ reuse , new _ trigram _ reuse , new _ word _ comb _ reuse ) can distinguish Nobel prize papers from control papers and outperform the ( text ) metrics capturing novelty at the time of publications in terms of t - statistic and Cohen’s d . Each of the text metrics accounting for the impact of new ideas also outperforms cd , i . e . the disruptiveness index based on citations . Among all metrics , new _ word _ comb _ reuse performs best in identifying Nobel prizes . Given that Nobel prize papers arguably pioneered new scientific ideas with a major impact , these results illustrate that our text metrics accounting for the reuse of new ideas can capture the influence and diffusion of the new scientific ideas introduced by the focal paper . ‘Table 5’ 4 . 3 Regressions Table 6 displays results from logit regressions with a binary indicator for Nobel prize paper as outcome . The advantage of regressions is that it allows us to control for factors confounding the relationship between scoring on novelty , its reuse and receiving a Nobel prize . A first important control is the number of unique words , bigrams , and trigrams of a paper ( i . e . the text length of each paper ) , and whether a paper has an abstract available given that longer papers might mechanically score higher on the text metrics . In parallel , we control for the number of cited _ papers and the number of cited _ journals given that papers citing more ( journals ) might be more likely to cite new or atypical combinations of journals ( Fontana et al . , 2020 ) . Finally , we include fixed effects for publication year and field of study to account for the arguably very important differences across fields and time 52 . To evaluate the performance of the different metrics to correctly classify Nobel prize and control papers , we calculate precision , recall , and area under the curve ( AUC ) . Precision measures the share of predicted Nobel prize papers that are correctly classified . Recall is the share of real Nobel prize papers that are correctly identified . AUC varies between 0 . 5 ( no predictive power ) and 1 52 We obtain the field of study for each paper from Färber & Ao ( 2022 ) , which consists of 292 different fields . 18 ( perfect classification ) . Finally , the average marginal effect of each metric is calculated as the increase in the likelihood of being an Nobel prize paper corresponding with a one standard deviation increase in the particular metric . ‘Table 6’ Table 6 shows the results for the different indicators measuring the novelty of a paper at the time of publication . The regression results are largely in line with the descriptive statistics in Table 5 . All text metrics measuring novelty at the time of publication are significant at the 1 % level and outperform the baseline model including only control variables in terms of predictive power ( AUC ) . The only exceptions are new _ word , which is only significant at the 5 % level , and the two measures based on document embeddings ( cosine _ max and cosine _ avg ) that are not significant at the conventional 5 % level . Also wang cannot distinguish Nobel prize papers from control papers . Uzzi is statistically significant but generally performs worse than the text metrics for novelty ( except new _ word ) , particularly in terms of precision with more false positives . In line with the descriptive statistics , new _ word _ comb has the strongest discriminatory power of all novelty measures with a precision of 67 . 06 % , a recall of 72 . 27 % and an AUC of 0 . 73 . A one standard deviation increase in new _ word _ comb increases the likelihood of being an Nobel prize paper with 25 % . By contrast , uzzi , i . e . the best performing traditional metric based on citations , has a precision of 63 . 97 % , a recall of 69 . 75 % and an AUC of 0 . 70 . A one standard deviation decrease in uzzi ( with lower values on uzzi meaning higher novelty ) increases the likelihood of being an Nobel prize paper with 5 % . Exclusively relying on information available at the time of publication , new _ word _ comb correctly identifies 72 . 27 % of the Nobel prize papers , i . e . a significantly larger share than the traditional novelty measures . Binary versions of the text - based metrics ( new _ gram _ bin and new _ word _ comb _ bin ) are also significant . However , they generally perform worse , particularly in terms of precision , signaling a higher share of false positives . This finding suggest that Nobel prize papers typically include multiple new ngrams or word combinations and that count measures better capture the novelty a paper compared to binary indicators . If we include all text metrics together ( column 12 ) , new word and new bigram become statistically insignificant at conventional levels . Using all text metrics together compared to exclusively using new _ word _ comb provides a small increase in precision and AUC , indicating improved overall model performance and more accurate positive predictions , however , it results in a small decrease in recall , suggesting that the model might be less adept in identifying Nobel prize 19 papers . This result suggests again that new _ word _ comb is perhaps our best proxy for novelty of a paper at the time of publication . ‘Table 7’ As shown in Table 7 , the text metrics measuring the influence or impact of new scientific ideas on subsequent scientific publications generally outperform the ( text ) metrics measuring novelty at the time of publication . This finding is reassuring given that Nobel prize papers likely cover new scientific ideas with a major impact on subsequent scientific literature . Comparing all measures together , including cd measuring the disruptiveness of a paper based on received citations , we find that new _ word _ comb _ reuse has the strongest ability to correctly identify Nobel prize papers with a precision of 71 . 03 % , a recall of 75 . 21 % and an AUC of 0 . 77 . A one standard deviation increase in new _ word _ comb increases the likelihood of being an Nobel prize paper with 26 % . By contrast , cd has a precision of 65 . 48 % , a recall of 69 . 33 % and an AUC of 0 . 72 . A one standard deviation increase in cd increases the likelihood of being an Nobel prize paper with 10 % . Including all text - based metrics together compared to exclusively using new _ word _ comb _ reuse ( column 7 ) , the precision and AUC slightly improve but the recall decreases significantly . Although the text metrics seem to relatively accurately predict Nobel prize papers , they are evidently far from perfect . Likewise , Nobel prize papers are not a perfect validation set for novelty . On the one hand , a significant share of the predicted Nobel prize papers are in fact control papers , i . e . false positives . Nevertheless , some of the control papers might also cover new scientific ideas , but simply did not receive a Nobel prize , and are therefore not necessarily false positives for novelty . For example , one control paper 53 by Paul Dirac published in Proceedings of the Royal Society of London in 1925 ( in the same year , journal , volume and issue as the paper 54 linked to the Nobel prize awarded to Edward Victor Appleton ) introduced for the first time the bigram “ quantum mechanic ” . 55 On the other hand , there are also Nobel prize papers missed by the text metrics , i . e . false negatives . To give one example , Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov were awarded the 2010 Nobel Prize in 53 Dirac , P . A . M . ( 1925 ) . The fundamental equations of quantum mechanics . Proceedings of the Royal Society of London . Series A , Containing Papers of a Mathematical and Physical Character , 109 ( 752 ) , 642 - 653 . 54 Appleton , E . V . , & Barnett , M . A . F . ( 1925 ) . On some direct evidence for downward atmospheric reflection of electric rays . Proceedings of the Royal Society of London . Series A , Containing Papers of a Mathematical and Physical Character , 109 ( 752 ) , 621 - 641 . 55 The term " quantum mechanics " was introduced in German for the first time by Max Born and Pascual Jordan in the paper title “Zur Quantenmechanik” published in the journal “Zeitschrift für Physik” in 1925 . However , Paul Dirac first used this term in English . 20 Physics “for their groundbreaking experiments regarding graphene” 56 , a two - dimensional material with unique properties . While Geim and Novoselov accomplished to isolate this material in its purest form , i . e . a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a two - dimensional lattice , the term “ graphene” was introduced before by chemists Hans - Peter Boehm , Ralph Setton , and Eberhard Stumpp in 1986 . 57 This example is again a reminder that Nobel prize selection is based on new scientific ideas with big impact and not necessarily on novelty per se . 5 . Literature Review Papers As a second validation , we collect a large sample of literature review papers and a matched control sample of original non - review papers . Our key assumption is that review papers typically summarize prior scientific findings rather than pioneering new scientific insights themselves . Thus , we assume review papers are less likely to introduce new scientific ideas relative to the matched control papers ( Wu et al . , 2019 ) . Or put differently , we assume control papers are more likely to pioneer new scientific insights compared to review papers . Nevertheless , the large majority of all scientific papers are perhaps not very original or novel and only cover a small incremental advance over the pre - existing body of scientific knowledge ( e . g . Uzzi et al . , 2013 ; Wang et al . , 2017 ) . Therefore , in contrast to the Nobel prize papers that arguably cover very original and novel scientific ideas , we expect the average control paper in our sample to score relatively low on novelty . As such , it is arguably more difficult for the metrics to distinguish review papers from control papers compared to distinguishing Nobel prize papers from control papers . This makes review papers a less convincing validation test . Moreover , in contrast to Nobel prize papers , the average control paper in our sample is particularly unlikely to introduce new scientific ideas with a major impact . As such , we will focus the validation on the different metrics capturing novelty at the time of publication . Besides the different drawbacks compared to the Nobel prize validation , the advantage is that we can collect a large sample of review papers across all fields of study and not exclusively focus on a small sample of Nobel prize papers that likely cover very original new scientific insights conditional on having a huge impact on later work . 5 . 1 Data 56 The Nobel Prize in Physics 2010 .

Nomenclature and terminology of graphite intercalation compounds . Synthetic Metals , 11 ( 66 ) . 21 We identify all scientific papers in history which have both the keywords “literature” and “review“ somewhere in their title . Next , we use the same case - control study design as for Nobel prize papers and match each review paper to one control paper , i . e . a regular paper that does not mention the keywords “literature” or “review” in its title or abstract , but is published in the same year , journal , volume and issue as the literature review paper 58 . In case of multiple matching control papers , we randomly sample one . Matching on journal , year , volume and issue controls for differences across scientific fields and time . Because certain journals exclusively publish review papers , we also exclude papers ( both review and matched control papers ) published in journals that mention “literature” or “review” in the journal name ( e . g . Journal of Economic Literature ) . Given our research design , eliminating false negative review papers is more desirable than covering the entire population of review papers . Finally , we test the ability of all metrics to correctly distinguish review papers from control papers . Our sample includes 48 , 265 review papers published between 1901 and 2010 and 48 , 265 matched control papers . 5 . 2 Results Table 8 shows descriptive statistics for the review versus control papers . All text metrics indicate that review papers have a significantly lower novelty than control papers with a t - test significant at p = 0 . 000 . The only exception is cosine _ avg ( insignificant at p = 0 . 6000 ) . By contrast , review papers are more novel according to the traditional measures capturing novelty at the time of publication based on paper citations ( wang and uzzi ) . This is likely driven by the fact that review papers cover a broader and more interdisciplinary set of references to prior papers resulting in more novel and unconventional combinations of cited journals and thus a significantly higher novelty score according to wang and uzzi . It is precisely for this reason that review papers are typically not included when analyzing novelty using uzzi or wang ( e . g . Wang et al . , 2017 ) . As predicted , Cohen’s d is much lower compared to the Nobel prize validation illustrating that the difference in novelty between review papers and matched control papers is significantly smaller compared to the difference between Nobel prize papers and matched control papers . Nevertheless , in line with the Nobel prize validation , new _ word _ comb performs best in distinguishing review papers from matched control papers at the time of publication in terms of both t - statistic and Cohen’s d . ‘Table 8’ 58 In case the journal issue of the literature review paper is not available , we match on journal , year and volume . In case the journal volume of the review paper is not available , we match on journal and year . 22 Table 9 shows the result of logit regressions with a binary indicator for review paper as outcome . The findings from the regression analysis are largely in line with the descriptive statistics . All new text metrics ( except cosine _ avg ) indicate that review papers have a significantly lower novelty than control papers . However , as expected , the overall predictive power of the metrics to distinguish review papers from regular papers is lower than for Nobel prize papers , and the differences between the different metrics are very small . Similarly , the difference in performance between the models including text metrics and the baseline model are very small . In contrast to Nobel prize papers , cosine _ max becomes significant illustrating how literature review papers are indeed less novel . Nevertheless , in line with the validation for Nobel prize papers , new _ word _ comb again seems to perform best overall with a precision of 65 . 88 % , a recall of 69 . 45 % , and AUC of 0 . 728 . A one standard deviation increase in new _ word _ comb decreases the likelihood of being a review paper with 8 . 73 % . ‘Table 9’ 6 . Top Cited Papers Finally , interest in being able to identify novel papers comes from their higher potential for major impact , although with a higher level of uncertainty of impact . Concerns persist that the science system may insufficiently support novel science , thereby potentially missing opportunities for scientific breakthroughs ( Alberts et al . , 2014 ; Franzoni et al . , 2022 ) . Prior literature using citation based indicators for novelty indeed found that novel papers are more likely to become highly cited , the standard measure for scientific breakthroughs ( e . g . , Uzzi et al . , 2013 , Wang et al . , 2017 ) . We check in this section whether top cited papers indeed were more novel at the time of publication , and compare the text and citation based metrics for novelty . To this end , we collect a large sample of highly cited papers and matched control papers that are not highly cited . 6 . 1 Data We calculate for every paper in MAG the total number of citations received from later papers until 2021 . Next , we identify top cited papers as papers that received more citations than the 99 th percentile of papers published in the same journal and year . To avoid bias , we exclude papers published after 2010 and papers from journals with less than 100 papers published in a given year . We follow the same case - control study design as for Nobel prize papers and randomly sample for every top cited paper one non top cited control paper published in the 23 same year , journal , volume and issue 59 . Matching on journal , year , volume and issue controls for differences across scientific fields and time . The final sample includes 216 , 434 top cited papers and 216 , 434 matched control papers . 6 . 2 Results Table 10 shows descriptive statistics for the top cited versus control papers . With the exception of text metrics based on the document - level embeddings ( cosine _ max and cosine _ avg ) , all ex ante novelty measures are significantly higher for top cited papers compared to matched control papers ( i . e . t - test significant at p = 0 . 000 ) . Comparing among ex ante novelty metrics , new _ bigram , new _ trigram and new _ word _ comb perform best in terms of both t - statistic and Cohen’s d . They also outperforms the citation based ex ante novelty metrics , i . e . uzzi and wang . Given that top cited papers are arguably more likely to introduce new scientific ideas with a major impact on later scientific publications , it is reassuring that the text metrics indicators accounting for the impact of new scientific ideas as measured by their reuse in future papers ( new _ word _ reuse , new _ bigram _ reuse , new _ trigram _ reuse , and new _ word _ comb _ reuse ) outperform the ( text ) metrics capturing novelty at the time of publications in terms of t - statistic and Cohen’s d . They also outperforms cd which captures the disruptiveness of a focal paper based on future citations . Table 11 shows the results of logit regressions with a binary indicator for top cited paper as outcome . The findings are in line with the results of the descriptive statistics in Table 10 . ‘Tables 10 & 11’ 7 . Robustness checks Abstracts are not available for a significant fraction of papers in MAG . This might introduce bias in the text metrics and analyses . We tried to control for this bias by including in all regressions a binary indicator for whether an abstract is available . We also control for the text length of a paper ( number of unigrams , bigrams and trigrams ) as this might influence the probability of introducing a new ngram or word combination . As an additional robustness check , we recalculate all text metrics ( except the metrics based on embeddings , i . e . cosine _ max and cosine _ avg ) for the full population of MAG papers by using exclusively the title of a paper , which is available for all papers in our sample . We use the new text metrics 59 In case the journal issue of the top cited paper is not available , we match on journal , year and volume . In case the journal volume of the top cited paper is not available , we match on journal and year . 24 based on titles to replicate the Nobel prize validation . Tables A . 2 , A . 3 , and A . 4 display the descriptive statistics and regressions . For the literature review papers , Tables A . 5 and A . 6 display the descriptive statistics and regressions . Finally , for top cited papers , Tables A . 7 and A . 8 show the descriptive statistics and regressions . Our main findings do not change . Not surprisingly , the overall predictive power of the text metrics exclusively based on titles is lower illustrating that paper abstracts contain useful information to identify new scientific ideas and the impact of those ideas on later work . 8 . Discussion and Conclusion New scientific insights are a key driver of scientific and technological progress , economic growth , and social welfare . Only a small minority of scientific papers meaningfully push the scientific frontier by pioneering new scientific ideas with a major influence on scientific progress and publishing . To be able to analyze the dynamics of scientific progress , it is important to identify these papers and their impact on subsequent literature . Prior work has traditionally relied on citations to measure the novelty or relatedly disruptiveness of scientific papers ( e . g . , Uzzi et al . , 2013 ; Wang et al . , 2017 ; Funk & Owen - Smith , 2017 ) . But , citations only capture prior art and not the scientific content and contribution of the paper itself , and the majority of citations even do not signal meaningful intellectual prior art ( Teplitskiy et al . , 2022 ) . Therefore , citations arguably cannot accurately identify new scientific ideas at the time of publication nor measure the influence of these new scientific ideas on later work . In this paper , we circumvent the use of citations and apply text mining techniques to harness and vectorize the rich scientific content of publication documents , to identify new scientific ideas at the time of publication , and to measure the influence of the new scientific ideas on subsequent scientific progress and publishing . We validate different alternative text metrics and their improvement over traditional metrics based on citations . The validation studies support the use of text metrics to identify new scientific ideas and measure the novelty of papers at the time of publication , and to measure the influence of these new ideas on later scientific work . They also illustrates the improvement of the text metrics over the traditional metrics based on citations . Among all metrics capturing the novelty of a paper at the time of publication , new keyword combinations seems to have the strongest discriminatory power to predict Nobel prize and literature review papers . This measure perhaps best proxies the conventional view that new scientific ideas result from the recombination of prior knowledge and ideas ( Nelson & Winter , 1982 ; Weitzman , 1998 ; Uzzi et al . , 2013 ; Wang et al . , 2017 ) . Moreover , taking into 25 account the number of later papers which reuse the same keyword combinations provides a measure for the intellectual influence or impact of new ideas and outperforms all other metrics in terms of identifying Nobel prize papers , i . e . papers that arguably pushed the scientific frontier and had a major influence on scientific progress . Nevertheless , we find that novel papers typically score on multiple text metrics simultaneously . We advise future users to experiment with different ( combinations of ) metrics in order to check the robustness of their findings rather than picking one metric . Interestingly , the new text metrics capturing the impact of new ideas only weakly correlate with citation - based measures for impact . As we illustrated in the manuscript , papers on average tend to cite more recent and more closely related prior work , and not necessarily every foundational paper that they directly or indirectly build upon . As such , our text metrics and data provide a new way to study the diffusion and impact of new scientific ideas independent from using paper citations which are shown to be sensitive to different biases ( e . g . , Teplitskiy et al . , 2022 ) . Despite the many benefits , the use of text also has a number of important limitations that future users should carefully take into consideration . First and foremost , unlike citations , text data is unstructured and messy and especially for older papers the title and abstract are sometimes recovered through optical character recognition ( OCR ) which might introduce mistakes and bias . Given that we rely on Microsoft Academic Graph , our metrics and findings are greatly affected by the quality of this source data . We invite others to replicate our metrics and findings on other ( perhaps better curated ) publication databases such as the Web of Science or Scopus . Yet , the key disadvantage of alternative databases is that they typically do not provide open access . Second , although lemmatization accounts for different spellings of the same word , it does not correct all spelling errors and does not account for synonyms ( different words with the same meaning ) and homonyms ( same word with different meanings ) . The use of paper - level embeddings does account for synonyms , homonyms , and the order and context of words in the text of publications , but the metrics that we developed in this paper based on embeddings did not perform well to identify novelty . This maybe came as a surprise given that we used SPECTER , currently perhaps the best performing document - level embedding of scientific papers . This metric is arguably better suited to measure the similarity between publication documents than to identify new scientific ideas ( Beltagy et al . , 2019 ; Cohan et al . , 2020 ; Erhardt et al . , 2022 ) . 26 Another limitation is that new scientific ideas and concepts might get a certain label only after the pioneering paper is published , or the pioneering paper might simply not use this label , or not use it in its title or abstract . In such cases , we might not identify the first paper pioneer a new scientific idea or concept and wrongly assign the new idea to a related paper published after the pioneering paper . In addition , because of open access data restrictions , we unfortunately could only use the titles and abstracts of scientific publications while other sections − introduction , conclusion , description of contribution relative to prior papers – most likely contain additional relevant information to identify the creation and impact of new scientific ideas . Besides limitations related to the use of text , another restriction is related to the sample of publications included in our sample . Ideally , every scientific publication in history should be included in the analysis in order to trace the scientific frontier over time and assign new scientific insight to the right paper . We relied on Microsoft Academic Graph , which is arguable the largest database of scientific publications going back in history and has the major advantage of including titles and abstracts of all publications and being open access which is not the case for other publication databases such as the Web of Science or Scopus . This allows us to openly share the text metrics that we developed . Although Microsoft Academic Graph does not provide any new updates after December 2021 , OpenAlex took over its role and the MAG paper identifiers are compatible with the paper identifiers in OpenAlex . That being said , MAG arguably does not include every single paper published in history and might be more messy and less reliable than other publication databases . In particular , an important limitation is that we were unable to use a significant number of publications because we could not recover the full publication date . We advise future users to further clean measurement errors , experiment with different alternative metrics , to control for whether the paper has an abstract available , to control for the text length of a paper , and to control for differences across different fields of study and over time . A fruitful opportunity for follow on research is to more carefully disentangle the text of publications and leverage more advanced NLP tools . This could involve employing part - of - speech ( POS ) tagging , Named Entity Recognition ( NER ) or phrase mining techniques , to discern the most coherent and contextually relevant phrases from the content of a publication . Such an approach could facilitate a deeper understanding of the construct of an new scientific idea and could help in operationalizing it more effectively ( Leahey et al . , 2023 ) . Specifically , POS - tagging can help to refine ngrams or word combinations which might contain verbs , adjectives , or adverbs , patterns that may be considered as noise or 27 spurious signals of a new scientific idea . NER can help to differentiate the words , bigrams and trigrams and categorize them for instance into research questions , methods , data , findings , and scientific contributions . This would allow a more detailed and comprehensive identification of the specific types of new scientific insights or novel contributions of each paper and offer richer data to study different aspects of scientific progress ( Luo et al . , 2022 ; Cheng et al . , 2023 ; Leahey et al . , 2023 ; Shi & Evans , 2023 ) . Nevertheless , a key contribution of the new text measures compared to prior approaches is that they can provide new indicators for the two stages of scientific progress , i . e . the creation of new scientific ideas at the time of publication versus the later use and diffusion of these very same novel ideas . This opens up new avenues to study not only the emergence of new scientific ideas but also the diffusion and influence of those ideas ( Arts & Fleming , 2018 ; Pezzoni et al . , 2022 ) . What drives the creation of new scientific ideas and which factors influence or hamper the diffusion of these new ideas ? Are junior scholars or scholars exploring previously unfamiliar scientific fields more likely to discover new scientific insights ? Is there a bias against new scientific ideas pioneered by junior or female scholars , scholars from different scientific disciplines or from lower ranked institutions ( e . g . Aneja et al . , 2023 ) ?
