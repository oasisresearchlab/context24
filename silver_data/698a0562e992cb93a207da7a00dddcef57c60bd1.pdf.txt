3981 Introduction The cytoskeleton plays a central role in cell morphology and motility . In particular the F - actin cytoskeleton of most eukaryotic cells is dynamically reorganized , providing force for shape changes and movements ( Borisy and Svitkina , 2000 ; Pantaloni et al . , 2001 ) . This is particularly evident during nervous system development , when growth cones must advance and synaptic plasticity has to be regulated . Rearrangement of actin is evoked rapidly by extracellular stimuli , and sets of actin - associated proteins are thought to act cooperatively in the polymerization , crosslinking and anchorage of actin ﬁlaments ( Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ) . Actin dynamics is controlled by a small set of proteins . The Arp2 / 3 complex has been shown to nucleate de novo actin polymerization ( Machesky et al . , 1994 ) . Arp2 / 3 is normally repressed , but can be activated by the members of the Wiskott family Wasp and Wave . The Wasp proteins are auto - inhibited , whereas the Wave proteins are trans - inhibited . Both usually require small G proteins of the Rho family for activation ( Miki and Takenawa , 2003 ) . In the case of Wasp , activated , GTP - bound Cdc42 binds to the CRIB ( Cdc42 / Rac Interactive Binding ) domain of Wasp , releasing the auto - inhibition and thereby leading to the activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Higgs and Pollard , 2001 ; Rohatgi et al . , 1999 ) . However , a structure - function analysis of the Drosophila Wasp has demonstrated that the Cdc42 - binding domain is not strictly necessary for function , suggesting that alternative pathways , such as phosphorylation can activate WASP ( Tal et al . , 2002 ) . Indeed , some tyrosine kinases have been shown to activate Wasp by phosphorylation ( Cory et al . , 2002 ; Scott et al . , 2002 ; Suetsugu et al . , 2002 ) . In contrast to Wasp , Wave is not auto - inhibited . It is kept in an inactive state through association with a protein complex comprising Kette / Nap1 , Sra1 ( speciﬁcally Rac associated 1 , Sra - 1 ; also called CYFIP / p140Sra - 1 , from here on called Sra - 1 according to FlyBase ) and the Abelson - interactor protein ( Abi ) ( Eden et al . , 2002 ) . Upon dissociation or conformational changes of this complex , Wave is assumed to be active ( Eden et al . , 2002 ; Steffen et al . , 2004 ) . Thus , Kette or Sra - 1 should antagonize Wave function . This is supported by genetic studies in Dictyostelium and Drosophila ( Blagg et al . , 2003 ; Bogdan and Klämbt , 2003 ) . Cell culture experiments show that Wave is degraded in a Ubiquitin - dependent manner following disruption of the Sra - 1 / Kette complex ( Kunda et al . , 2003 ; Rogers et al . , 2003 ) . These latter ﬁndings are likely to reﬂect the fast inactivation of Wave once activated . In vitro , activation of Wave can be mediated by Rac1 or SH3 domains , which presumably bind to Sra - 1 ( Eden et al . , 2002 ; Kobayashi et al . , 1998 ; Miki et al . , 2000 ) . The Sra - 1 / Kette protein complex is not only required to negatively regulate the activity of Wave but is also able to activate Wasp function at the membrane ( Bogdan and Klämbt , 2003 ) . The interaction of Kette and Wasp is not direct but is likely to be mediated by the Abi , which can bind to both Kette and Wasp ( Bogdan and Klämbt , 2003 ) . Interestingly , the Nck adapter protein is also able to bind to Wasp via its third SH3 domain ( Rivero - Lezcano et al . , 1995 ) . Thus , Sra - 1 , which can Regulation of growth cone and cell motility involves the coordinated control of F - actin dynamics . An important regulator of F - actin formation is the Arp2 / 3 complex , which in turn is activated by Wasp and Wave . A complex comprising Kette / Nap1 , Sra - 1 / Pir121 / CYFIP , Abi and HSPC300 modulates the activity of Wave and Wasp . We present the characterization of Drosophila Sra - 1 ( speciﬁcally Rac1 - associated protein 1 ) . sra - 1 and kette are spatially and temporally co - expressed , and both encoded proteins interact in vivo . During late embryonic and larval development , the Sra - 1 protein is found in the neuropile . Outgrowing photoreceptor neurons express high levels of Sra - 1 also in growth cones . Expression of double stranded sra - 1 RNA in photoreceptor neurons leads to a stalling of axonal growth . Following knockdown of sra - 1 function in motoneurons , we noted abnormal neuromuscular junctions similar to what we determined for hypomorphic kette mutations . Similar mutant phenotypes were induced after expression of membrane - bound Sra - 1 that lacks the Kette - binding domain , suggesting that sra - 1 function is mediated through kette . Furthermore , we could show that both proteins stabilize each other and directly control the regulation of the F - actin cytoskeleton in a Wasp - dependent manner .

To test whether the mutant phenotypes of sra - 1 and kette are alike as predicted , and whether Sra - 1 indeed acts through Kette to regulate actin dynamics , we conducted a functional characterization of Sra - 1 during Drosophila development . Sra - 1 and Kette are both required for axonal growth and perform common functions during formation and maturation of neuromuscular junctions ( NMJ ) . Analysis of temporal and spatial distribution of the Sra - 1 protein shows a prominent co - expression with Kette . Both proteins are maternally expressed and later in development become concentrated in the developing nervous system ( CNS ) . Sra - 1 is highly expressed in growth cones and neuromuscular synapses . Direct interaction of Sra - 1 and Kette depends on a short C - terminal domain of the Sra - 1 protein . Expression of a Sra - 1 variant lacking the C - terminal domain leads to a dominant - negative phenotype that can be suppressed by expression of an activated Kette protein . In tissue culture cells as well as in vivo Sra - 1 function is required for F - actin organization . Further genetic analyses demonstrate that Sra - 1 function at the membrane depends on the presence of Wasp . Materials and methods Genetics All crosses were performed at 25°C unless otherwise indicated . The following strains were used : wasp 1 / TM6 wasp 3 / TM ; kette J4 - 48 / TM6 , kette D 2 - 6 / TM6 and kette J1 - 70 / TM6 ( Hummel et al . , 2000 ) . To determine the gain - and loss - of - function phenotype of Kette Myr , Sra Myr , Sra D C Myr and Sra - RNAi , we used the GAL4 system ( Brand and Perrimon , 1993 ) . Transgenic ﬂies carrying the following constructs were generated following standard procedures : UAS - kette Myc ; UAS - sra Myc ; UAS - sra - D C Myc and UAS - sraRNAi . The Kette Myr , Sra Myr and Sra D C Myr constructs were made by fusing DNA encoding the ﬁrst 88 amino acids from Drosophila Src1 ( Simon et al . , 1985 ) to the ﬁrst codon of Kette , Sra - full - length and Sra 1151aa . To generate the Sra - RNAi construct , the sra DNA ( coding sequence + 1 to + 300 , containing no repetitive sequence motif ) was cloned as an inverted repeat into pWIZ ( Lee and Carthew , 2003 ) . Several independent transgenic lines were analyzed in each case . Antibody production The rabbit anti - Sra antibody ( Sra900 ) was generated against the ﬁrst N - terminal 300 amino acids of Sra fused with a His 6 - tag ( Qiagen ) . The His 6 - Sra fusion protein was expressed in E . coli and puriﬁed with Ni - NTA resin ( Qiagen ) under native conditions . Rabbits were immunized with puriﬁed proteins by Davids Biotechnologie ( Germany ) . In situ hybridization , immunolabeling and western blot analysis In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry was performed as described ( Hummel et al . , 1997 ; Tautz and Pfeiﬂe , 1989 ) . Sra - speciﬁc riboprobes were generated from EST clones LD47929 and LD19991 . Larval dissections and antibody staining were carried out as previously described ( Schuster et al . , 1996 ) . Antibodies were used as follows : affinity - puriﬁed anti - Sra polyclonal antibody , 1 : 100 ; mAB nc46 ( Reichmuth et al . , 1995 ) , 1 : 10 ; mAB BP102 , 1 : 100 ( Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank ) . For protein extracts , staged embryos were mashed with a pestle in lysis buffer ( 1 3 PBS , 1 % NP40 , 1 mM DTT and 1 mM PMSF ) . Lysates were centrifuged 10 minutes at 10 , 000 g to yield the cytoplasmic supernatant . The amount of total protein was determined by a Bradford assay ( BioRad ) . Equivalent amounts of protein extract were separated by SDS - PAGE , and analyzed by western blot as described previously ( Bogdan et al . , 2001 ) . Two - hybrid assay To test the interaction between Sra - 1 and Kette , we inserted the kette ORF in frame with the GAL4 DNA - binding domain into the GBK - T7 vector ( Clontech ) and the Sra - 1 full - length and C - terminal deletion of Sra - 1 in frame with the GAL4 activation domain into the GAD - T7 vector ( Clontech ) . Cell culture and immunoﬂuorescence microscopy Drosophila S2R + ( Yanagawa et al . , 1998 ) cells were propagated in 1 3 Schneider’s Drosophila media ( Gibco ) supplemented with 10 % FBS , 50 units / ml penicillin and 50 m g / ml streptomycin in 75 cm 2 T - ﬂasks ( Sarstedt ) at 25°C . For immunoﬂuorescence microscopy , 2 3 10 5 cells were plated on glass cover slips ( pretreated with or without ﬁbronectin ) in 24 - well plates , cultured for 24 hours and ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde , permeabilized with 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 , stained with Drosophila anti - Kette antibody 97 / 82 ( 1 : 2000 dilution ) or puriﬁed anti - Sra antibody ( Sra900 ) followed by Alexa - ﬂuorophore - conjugated goat anti - rabbit IgG antibody ( Molecular Probes , 1 : 1000 dilution ) . For ﬁlamentous actin and nucleic acid staining , cells were prepared as described above and incubated in 1 - 2 units Alexa - ﬂuorophore - conjugated phalloidin ( Molecular Probes ) and in 300 nM DAPI ( Molecular Probes ) , respectively . The samples were mounted in a 25 % ( w / v ) Mowiol ( Sigma ) solution containing DABCO ( Sigma ) and visualized on a Leica LSM . Cell transfection and co - immunoprecipitation For co - immunoprecipitation of Myc - tagged Kette protein , Drosophila Schneider S2 cells ( 10 7 ) were co - transfected with UAS - kette - 7xmyc ( 2 m g ) and Act5C - GAL4 DNA ( 2 m g ) by Fugene ( Roche ) as described previously ( Bogdan et al . , 2001 ) . Transfected cells were harvested and lysed in ice - cold lysis buffer ( 1 3 PBS , 0 . 5 % NP40 , 1 mM DTT and 1 mM PMSF ) . Lysates were centrifuged 10 minutes at 10 , 000 g to yield the cytoplasmatic supernatant . Total cell lysate was subjected to immunoprecipitation with monoclonal anti - Myc ( 9E10 ) immobilized by protein G beads . Immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS - PAGE , and proteins were analyzed by western blot as described previously ( Bogdan et al . , 2001 ) using polyclonal antiserum to Sra ( Sra900 ) . dsRNA production and RNAi treatment sra - 1 ORF ( 300 bp ) and kette ORF ( 570 bp ) were inserted into the vector pLITMUS - 28i ( BioLabs ) ﬂanked by T7 promoters . After linearization , dsRNAs were generated using a HiScribe RNAi Transcription Kit ( BioLabs ) as described previously ( Bogdan et al . , 2001 ) . dsRNA - treated cells were incubated for additional 2 - 3 days and analyzed by immunoﬂuorescence and western blot analysis . Results sra - 1 and kette are co - expressed and interact in vivo kette and sra - 1 are initially broadly expressed during embryogenesis ( Hummel et al . , 2000 ; Schenck et al . , 2003 ) ( see Fig . S1 at http : / / dev . biologists . org / supplemental ) . At the end of embryogenesis , RNA expression of both genes becomes restricted to the CNS ( Fig . 1A ) . To further analyze the expression of Sra - 1 we generated anti - Sra - 1 antibodies ( see Materials and methods for details ) . Western blot analyses show expression of Kette and Sra - 1 throughout development ( Fig . 1B ) . Antisera against the two proteins each recognize a single Development 131 ( 16 ) Research article 3983 Sra - 1 function in neuronal development band , which is present in cell extracts from ﬁrst cleavage stage embryos to hatching ( Fig . 1B ) . As both proteins are co - expressed during development and their vertebrate homologues are found in the same protein complex , we asked whether the two proteins could physically interact . First , we transfected Drosophila S2 tissue culture cells with a vector encoding a Myc - tagged Kette protein and cell lysates were subsequently subjected to immunoprecipitation . Sra - 1 protein at the expected size of 140 kDa was only detected in these precipitates , when we precipitated Kette using anti - Myc antibodies but not when we used anti - Slit antibodies as a control ( Fig . 1C ) . This co - immunoprecipitation indicates a direct binding of Kette and Sra - 1 . To further verify this assumption and to map the domain on the Sra - 1 protein relevant for this interaction , we used the yeast two - hybrid system . We found that full - length Sra - 1 protein efficiently binds to full - length Kette protein ( Fig . 1D ) . A small deletion of the last 100 C - terminal amino acids of the Sra - 1 protein was sufficient to abrogate the interaction between Sra - 1 and Kette , suggesting that the C - terminus of the Sra - 1 protein is essential for the interaction with Kette . In addition to Kette , the 140 kDa protein Sra - 1 has been reported to bind to Nck , Rac1 and FMRP , indicating that Sra - 1 acts as a scaffolding protein linking a larger number of proteins ( Fig . 1E ) ( Kobayashi et al . , 1998 ; Schenck et al . , 2003 ) . Sra - 1 expression during neuronal development Puriﬁed anti - Sra - 1 antisera allow detection of the endogenous Sra - 1 protein . The speciﬁcity of these antisera was conﬁrmed by Sra - 1 RNA interference ( RNAi ) , which removed Sra - 1 staining ( see Figs 3 , 5 ) . In agreement with high levels of RNA expression in the CNS , we noted highest level of Sra - 1 protein in the embryonic CNS neuropile , which consists of axons , dendrites and synapses ( Fig . 2A ) . Similarly , Sra - 1 is expressed in the optic lobe neuropile of third instar larvae ( Fig . 2B ) . Here , high levels of Sra - 1 protein expression can be noted in a zone between the developing lamina and medulla ( Fig . 2B , asterisk ) . EM - analyses have previously showed that this region consists of growth cones of the developing photoreceptor neurons which also express the 24B10 epitope ( Garrity et al . , 1999 ; Garrity et al . , 1996 ; Van Vactor et al . , 1988 ) ( Fig . 2B ) . In addition , we noted some Sra - 1 protein in eye imaginal discs cells ( Fig . 2C ) . sra - 1 is required for neuronal development The expression of Sra - 1 in growth cones suggests that it may be required for axonal pathﬁnding or targeting . To test this assumption , we generated transgenes expressing a double stranded sra - 1 RNA under the control of the UAS sequences to perform in vivo RNAi experiments ( Lee and Carthew , 2003 ) . In wild - type eye discs , photoreceptor neurons express Sra - 1 and the 24B10 marker as they navigate through the optic stalk to the lamina and medulla in the brain ( Fig . 3A ) . After expression of the sra - 1 RNAi construct in the developing eye disc using the eyeless - GAL4 driver , Sra - 1 protein expression is removed in the eye disc but not in the brain , demonstrating the speciﬁcity of the antisera ( Fig . 3B ) . Upon reduction of Sra - 1 expression , photoreceptor neurons exhibit pronounced axonal defects . The majority of the axons appear to be able to enter the brain , but then axons fail to grow towards their correct targets ( Fig . 3B ) . In addition , fewer photoreceptor cells develop and the compound eyes appear slightly smaller and have a rough appearance compared to the wild type ( Fig . 3C , D ) . These phenotypes are highly penetrant and can be observed in every ﬂy expressing sra - 1 RNAi ( n > 50 ) . sra - 1 function is not restricted to axonal pathﬁnding . Recently , defects in synaptic architecture were found in sra - 1 mutants ( Schenck et al . , 2003 ) . Similarly , inactivation of sra - 1 by RNAi speciﬁcally in neuronal cells using elav - GAL4 led to synaptic boutons with supernumerary buds ( 2 . 0 - fold increase compared with wild type , terminal boutons of 60 neuromuscular junctions on muscle 4 of 15 larvae were counted ) and a pronounced bulged 3D structure ( Fig . 4B ) . The cell type speciﬁc sra - 1 knockdown demonstrates a cell - Fig . 1 . Sra - 1 binds Kette through its C terminus .

( B ) Western blot analyses of Kette ( 120 kDa ) and Sra - 1 ( 140 kDa ) expression . Both proteins are expressed throughout embryogenesis and appear to be provided maternally . ( C ) Co - immunoprecipitation of Kette and Sra - 1 . Total cell lysate of S2 - cells expressing both Myc - tagged Kette and Sra - 1 was subjected to immunoprecipitation with monoclonal anti - Myc ( 9E10 ) or anti - Slit ( E555 . 6D ) . Sra - 1 is detected only in the anti - Myc precipitate , indicating binding of Kette and Sra - 1 . ( D ) To test the interaction between Sra - 1 and Kette , we turned to a yeast two hybrid assay . Interaction between Sra - 1 and Kette results in growth of the yeast cells and a blue color . Interaction is seen only when the C terminus is intact ( E ) . 3984 autonomous requirement for sra - 1 function in the developing presynaptic neuron . We then asked whether the interacting protein Kette is similarly required for synaptic development . Certain hypomorphic allele combinations allow development of third instar larvae ( Hummel et al . , 2000 ) . kette J1 - 70 / kette D 2 - 6 gives rise to larvae with smaller neuromuscular junctions carrying bulged synaptic boutons of irregular shape resembling the sra - 1 phenotype ( Fig . 4C ; 2 . 1 - fold increase of bud number of terminal boutons on muscle 4 , n = 60 ) . As Sra - 1 was shown to bind Kette via its C terminus ( Fig . 1 ) , we assumed that expression of a Sra - 1 protein lacking this domain ( Sra - 1 D C ) may interfere with synaptic development . As wild - type Kette appears to function at the membrane , we generated a membrane tethered Sra - 1 D C protein variant ( Sra - 1 D C Myr ) . Indeed , when we expressed such a construct in all neurons using the elav - GAL4 driver , we noted a synaptic phenotype similar to the one caused by reduction of sra - 1 function by RNAi ( Fig . 4D ; 2 . 3 - fold increase of bud number of terminal boutons on muscle 4 , n = 60 ) . Kette and Sra - 1 stabilities are mutually dependent A number of reports have recently shown that Sra - 1 and Kette stabilize the Arp2 / 3 activator Wave ( Blagg et al . , 2003 ; Kunda et al . , 2003 ; Rogers et al . , 2003 ) . Degradation of Wave following disruption of the regulatory complex may be an efficient way to terminate Wave activity . If all protein members of the complex are required to keep Wave inactive , one might expect that removal of Kette or Sra - 1 should also lead to a downregulation of the remaining proteins of the complex . We have tested this assumption by following Kette or Sra - 1 protein expression in S2 cells in which kette or sra - 1 function was knocked down by RNAi . As previously shown , gene silencing of kette and sra - 1 in Drosophila S2 by RNAi cell line induced identical morphological phenotypes ( Blagg et al . , 2003 ; Bogdan and Klämbt , 2003 ; Kunda et al . , 2003 ; Rogers et al . , 2003 ) . In comparison with wild - type cells , dsRNA - treated cells assume a starﬁsh - like morphology with multiple ﬁlopodia like extensions and a prominent accumulation of cytosolic F - actin ( Fig . 5 , arrowheads ) .

( A ) During embryogenesis Sra - 1 ( green ) accumulates in the neuropile of the central nervous system , which also expresses the BP102 epitope . ( B ) In the optic ganglia of third instar larval brains Sra - 1 protein expression can be detected in the medulla ( md ) and photoreceptor axons that traverse the lamina ( la ) . An intense label can be seen in the termination zone of the photoreceptor axons R1 - R6 in the lamina ( star ) .

The merge channel is shown in the bottom row . ( A ) In wild type , photoreceptor neurons express both Sra - 1 and 24B10 , and project their axons through the optic stalk ( os ) to the lamina ( la ) or medulla ( me ) . ( B ) Following expression of sra - 1 dsRNA using an eyeless - GAL4 driver , Sra - 1 protein expression was removed from the eye disc but not the brain ( star ) . Concomitantly , we observed severe axonal targeting defects . Most axons appear to be able to enter the brain , but fail to grow towards their correct targets ( arrow ) . ( C , D ) Adult eyes of ( C ) a wild - type ﬂy and ( D ) a transgenic ﬂy expressing sra - 1 RNAi in the eyeless pattern . 3985 Sra - 1 function in neuronal development analyses demonstrate that kette RNAi efficiently eliminates Kette protein expression ( Fig . 5B , D ) . Interestingly , kette RNAi also reduces Sra - 1 expression ( Fig . 5 ) . Conversely , when we reduced sra - 1 function by RNAi , we blocked both Sra - 1 and Kette protein expression ( Fig . 5C , D ) . These data suggest that Kette and Sra - 1 are closely linked and stabilize each other . Sra - 1 is required for bristle formation It has recently been shown that kette is required for F - actin formation ( Bogdan and Klämbt , 2003 ; Hummel et al . , 2000 ; Kunda et al . , 2003 ; Rogers et al . , 2003 ) . As the dynamics of the F - actin cytoskeleton is difficult to analyze in Drosophila neurons , we turned to the analysis of bristle development which crucially depends on F - actin dynamics ( Jacinto and Baum , 2003 ) . Hypomorphic kette mutants ( kette J1 - 70 / kette D 2 - 6 ) are characterized by typical bent bristles ( Fig . 6A , arrow ; about 15 % of the heads have one or more bent bristles , n = 250 ) . Given the general colocalization of Kette and Sra - 1 and the mutual stabilization of the two proteins , we anticipated that sra - 1 is also required for bristle development . Following expression of sra - 1 dsRNA in the scabrous pattern , and formation of microchaete and macrochaete , we observed bent bristles similar to those in kette mutants ( Fig . 6B , arrow ; about 10 % of the heads show one or more bent bristles , n = 170 ) . When we increased the number of sra - 1 RNAi transgenes , the penetrance of the bent bristle phenotype increased ( about 30 % of the heads show one or more bent bristles , n = 100 ) . In addition , we observed a loss of some bristles in ﬂies expressing high levels of sra - 1 RNAi ( in 5 % of the heads , n = 100 ) . A similar increase in the phenotypic penetrance was observed when we lowered the dose of kette in ﬂies expressing one copy of the sra - 1 RNAi construct . Expression of the Sra - 1 D C Myr protein lacking the Kette interaction domain , resulted in a similar bristle phenotype . When one copy of the transgene was expressed , all heads lacked bristles . The few remaining bristles are frequently bended ( Fig . 6C ) . When we increased the dose of the sra - 1 D C Myr transgene , almost no bristles develop ( data not shown ) . Sra - 1 affects F - actin formation To more directly test a possible role of sra - 1 on F - actin formation , we performed phalloidin staining of bristles during pupal development . In wild - type animals , bristles are preﬁgured by pointed F - actin bundles ( Fig . 7A ) . Cortical F - actin is found in a sharp zone close to the cell membrane . When we expressed sra - 1 dsRNA , pointed F - actin bundles still form , but they show bent morphology ( as do the later bristles ) ( Fig . 7B ) . When we expressed the Sra - 1 D C Myr construct , no F - actin bundles were detected at the site where bristles are expected to develop , corresponding to the loss of bristles observed in adult stages .

The inlay shows a higher magniﬁcation of a terminal bouton highlighted by the boxed area . ( A ) Wild - type NMJ . Note the smooth morphology of the terminal boutons . Almost no extra branches or buds can be detected . ( B ) After sra - 1 RNA interference , an increased budding of terminal boutons was noted ( elav Gal4 3 UAS sra - 1 RNAi ) . ( C ) Third instar larvae carrying the weak hypomorphic allele combination kette J1 - 70 / kette 2 D 6 . There is an increase in budding tendency , which is particularly evident at the terminal boutons .

( C ) When sra - 1 function is inhibited by sra - 1 RNAi , Kette protein expression cannot be detected after 2 days of RNAi treatment . In addition , a F - actin phenotype develops ( compare B with C ) . ( D ) Western blot analysis showing mutual protein stabilization of Kette and Sra - 1 . sra - 1 RNAi affects Sra - 1 and Kette expression and , conversely , kette RNAi efficiently reduces Kette and Sra - 1 protein expression . 3986 We have recently shown that a membrane - tethered form of Kette behaves like an activated protein variant that efficiently reorganizes the formation of F - actin via modulating the activity of Wasp . When expressed in the developing notum of a ﬂy , this results in the formation of branched or brushed bristles ( Bogdan and Klämbt , 2003 ) . If both Kette and Sra - 1 act in the same complex , expression of a membrane - bound Sra - 1 is expected to act like the membrane - bound Kette protein . Indeed , expression of a myristylated full - length Sra - 1 protein ( Sra - 1 Myr ) in the scabrous pattern induced the formation of brushed F - actin bundles ( Fig . 7D , arrow ) . Furthermore the cortical F - actin appeared fuzzier and many irregular F - actin ﬁbers can be recognized ( Fig . 7D , arrowhead ) . Genetic interaction between sra - 1 , kette and wasp The F - actin phenotype seen following expression of the Sra - 1 Myr protein resulted in the formation of split bristles on the notum of the adult ﬂy ( Fig . 8B , about 10 % of the microchaete , see Fig . 8I ) . Expression of a membrane - tethered Kette protein resulted in a similar , Wasp - dependent , split bristle phenotype ( Fig . 8C , I ) ( Bogdan and Klämbt , 2003 ) . Animals expressing both membrane - tethered proteins display a synergistic effect ( Fig . 8C , I ) . To test whether the induction of the Sra - 1 Myr induced phenotype also depends on the function of both kette and wasp we expressed Sra - 1 Myr in heterozygous kette and wasp ﬂies . Whereas the reduction in the gene dose of kette did not signiﬁcantly modify the Sra - 1 Myr induced phenotype , heterozygous loss of wasp function clearly suppressed the branched bristle phenotype evoked by Sra - 1 Myr expression ( Fig . 8E , F , I ) . This indicates that either Sra - 1 does not require Kette to activate Wasp or the reduction in Kette expression level is not sufficient to detect phenotypic changes . Expression of the dominant - negative Sra - 1 D C Myr protein variant did not induce a branched bristle phenotype but led to a loss of bristles ( Fig . 6C , Fig . 8G , I ) . This bristle phenotype could be suppressed by the expression of activated Kette Myr ( Fig . 8H , I ) . Furthermore , ﬂies expressing both Sra - 1 D C Myr and Kette Myr show similarly split bristles as do ﬂies expressing only the Kette Myr protein . Thus , activated Kette acts downstream or independent of Sra - 1 to regulate the activity of the F - actin regulator Wasp . Discussion Axonal pathﬁnding and synaptic growth both required well regulated F - Actin dynamics . We have analyzed the role of Sra - 1 , which ( together with Kette ) constitutes an important regulator of Wasp mediated F - actin dynamics . Neural phenotypes of sra - 1and kette In addition to the CNS phenotypes , mutations in sra - 1 and kette both lead to synaptic defects that are characterized by an overall reduction in size of the neuromuscular junction , as well as the induction of supernumerary buds in sra - 1 and kette mutant synaptic boutons . It is known that new boutons often arise from existing ones by asymmetrical budding or symmetrical division ( Zito et al . , 1999 ) , which in turn requires an intact regulation of the actin cytoskeleton ( Luo , 2002 ; Notarangelo and Ochs , 2003 ) . The increased number of branches as well as the bulged appearance of the synaptic boutons after depletion of kette or sra - 1 function may reﬂect their function in regulating wasp ( Bogdan and Klämbt , 2003 ) . Indeed wasp mutants display synaptic phenotypes similar to Development 131 ( 16 ) Research article Fig . 6 . kette and sra - 1 function during bristle development .

This phenotypic trait increases following expression of higher levels of Sra - 1 RNAi . ( C ) After expression of a membrane - tethered Sra - 1 protein variant lacking the Kette interaction domain ( Sra - 1 D C Myr ) , frequent loss of bristles as well as bent bristles is observed . Fig . 7 . Sra - 1 affects F - actin formation . During pupal development , bristle morphology is preﬁgured by an apical F - actin extension , which can be visualized by phalloidin staining . All pupae were dissected 36 hours after puparium formation . ( A ) Wild type . ( B ) After expression of sra - 1 , dsRNA expression ( one copy ) using sca - GAL4 bent F - actin bundles , which are never seen in wild type , can be detected . ( C ) After expression of one copy of the sra - 1 D CMyr construct , no F - actin forms at the site where bristles are expected to develop ( star ) . ( D ) Following expression of full - length membrane tethered Sra - 1 protein using the sca - GAL4 driver , F - actin formation is initiated in a broader region of the apical cell surface ( arrow ) . In addition , the F - actin at the cell boundary appears to have a ‘fuzzier’ organization ( arrowheads ) . 3987 Sra - 1 function in neuronal development those of sra - 1 and kette ( Coyle et al . , 2004 ) . Recently , it has been found that the adaptor protein Nervous wreck ( Nwk ) binds Wasp and is also required for normal synapse morphology ( Coyle et al . , 2004 ) . Thus , Nwk might act as a scaffolding protein in the synapse assembling a Wasp activation complex comprising Sra - 1 , Kette and Abi . As in Drosophila , mutations in several of the vertebrate orthologs of the above mentioned genes are associated with learning deﬁcits , demonstrating the pivotal importance of F - actin dynamics for precise neuronal function ( Eden et al . , 2002 ; Endris et al . , 2002 ; Soderling et al . , 2003 ; Suzuki et al . , 2000 ; Yamamoto et al . , 2001 ) . Regulation of F - actin dynamics Rapid remodeling of the F - actin cytoskeleton is mostly brought about by the Arp2 / 3 complex , which in turn is activated by members of the Wasp and Wave protein families ( Machesky et al . , 1994 ; Miki and Takenawa , 2003 ; Nakagawa et al . , 2001 ; Takenawa and Miki , 2001 ) . Wasp as well as Wave are potent F - actin nucleation factors . Obviously within the cell their activity must be tightly regulated . Whereas Wasp is auto - inhibited , Wave is trans - inhibited and requires the inhibiting Sra - 1 Kette protein complex ( Eden et al . , 2002 ) . Upon dissociation of this complex or conformational changes within the complex , Wave is active and presumably remains active until it is degraded via ubiquitination ( Blagg et al . , 2003 ; Eden et al . , 2002 ; Kunda et al . , 2003 ; Rogers et al . , 2003 ; Steffen et al . , 2004 ) . This latter mechanism , which is frequently used in regulating the effective concentration of active proteins ( Di Fiore et al . , 2003 ; Moon et al . , 2002 ; Ou et al . , 2003 ) , ensures that Wave activity lasts for only a short time period . As we have shown here , Wave is not the only protein of the complex that is degraded upon disruption of the protein complex . Depletion of Kette not only leads to a loss of Wave but also of Sra - 1 . Vice versa , depletion of Sra - 1 leads to a loss of Kette . Thus , ultimately the stability of all proteins of the inhibitory Sra - 1 complex appears to be interdependent . We have previously shown that Kette can activate Wasp - mediated F - actin formation ( Bogdan and Klämbt , 2003 ) . We have shown that Sra - 1 function also depends on Wasp . In both cases , the membrane localization of Kette or Sra - 1 is essential , indicating that in vivo regulation of membrane recruitment of Sra - 1 and Kette is important for function . The data presented in this work also suggest that membrane - bound Sra - 1 or Kette proteins are both able to activate Wasp independently of each other . Membrane recruitment of Sra - 1 Vertebrate homologues of Sra - 1 and Kette were ﬁrst identiﬁed in a complex with the SH2 SH3 adapter Nck ( Kitamura et al . , 1996 ; Kitamura et al . , 1997 ) . The N - terminal SH3 domain of Nck is thought to bind to Sra - 1 ( Kitamura et al . , 1996 ) , evoking a model where Nck recruits Sra - 1 and the associated Kette Fig . 8 . Genetic interaction between sra - 1 , kette and wasp . ( A - H ) Morphology of microchaete on the thorax in different genetic backgrounds . Quantitative analyses are shown in I . ( A ) Wild - type ﬂies are characterized by an ordered array of microchaete , which are normally thin , straight and have a pointed end . ( B ) Following expression of one copy of the UAS - Sra - 1 Myr transgene in the scabrous pattern , shorter and split bristles develop ( arrow ) . ( C ) The same phenotype is observed after expression of membrane tethered Kette protein ( arrow ) . ( D ) Co - expression of both membrane - tethered Sra - 1 and Kette leads to a synergistic increase of bristle defects . ( E ) Same genetic background as in B but lacking one copy of the kette gene . The bristle phenotype evoked by Sra - 1 Myr expression is not affected . ( F ) Same genetic background as in B but lacking one copy of the wasp gene . The bristle phenotype evoked by Sra - 1 Myr expression is suppressed . ( G ) Expression of a UAS - Sra - 1 D C Myr transgene in the scabrous pattern results in loss of bristles . ( H ) When ﬂies co - express UAS - Sra - 1 D C Myr and UAS - Kette Myr transgenes , the loss of bristle phenotype is suppressed . However , bristles are brushed , which corresponds to the Kette Myr phenotype . ( I ) Quantitative analyses of the above - mentioned phenotypes . Three - hundred microchaete were counted in each case . 3988 protein to the membrane . We have previously shown that kette and dock , which encodes the Drosophila Nck homologue interact during axonal pathﬁnding ( Garrity et al . , 1996 ; Hummel et al . , 2000 ) . Cell signaling and cell adhesion leads to the activation of a number of receptor systems which in turn mediate anchorage - dependent recruitment of adapter proteins such as Nck ( Howe , 2001 ; Howe et al . , 2002 ; Li et al . , 2001 ) . Nck in turn is able to connect cell - surface receptors via different signal cascades to the F - actin cytoskeleton ( Buday et al . , 2002 ) . However , in vivo Nck cannot mediate all aspects of Sra - 1 / Kette function , as the complete loss of maternal and zygotic Nck results in similar but not identical phenotypes when compared with kette or sra - 1 loss - of - function phenotypes ( Fan et al . , 2003 ; Garrity et al . , 1996 ; Hummel et al . , 2000 ; Schenck et al . , 2003 ) . In the developing synapse , the function of Nck in recruiting Sra - 1 and Kette to the membrane may be fulﬁlled by Nwk , which as Nck also binds Wasp ( Coyle et al . , 2004 ; Zeng et al . , 2003 ) . Interestingly , both adaptor proteins are involved in Slit Robo signaling , where they may mediate different biological effects ( Fan et al . , 2003 ; Wong et al . , 2001 ) . This suggests that combinatorial and tissue speciﬁc factors are assembled in response to speciﬁc cues to activate Wasp in different cell types or compartments . We thank E .
