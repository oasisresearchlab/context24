This strategy is common in yeast and gradually within reach in other model organisms [ 1 ] . In yeast a tag is typically introduced into the genome together with a marker gene used to select for positive transformants [ 2 – 4 ] ( Figure S1A in Supporting Information S1 ) . Using this approach , valuable genome - wide resources for systematic protein complex purification and protein localization have been generated in S . cerevisiae [ 5 – 7 ] . However , introduction of a selection marker inevitably disrupts endogenous regulatory sequences and can affect endogenous gene expression by changing mRNA abundance , stability or localization [ 8 ] . Recombination systems , such as the Cre - lox system [ 9 ] , can be used for marker excision after tagging [ 10 , 11 ] but such strategies do not allow complete excision of all auxiliary sequences that might affect gene expression ( Figure S1B in Supporting Information S1 ) . Alternatively , seamless tagging can be achieved with the two - step delitto perfetto approach [ 12 ] ( Figure S1C in Supporting Information S1 ) or using spontaneous marker excision by homologous recombination [ 13 ] ( Figure S1D in Supporting Information S1 ) . However , these methods are incom - patible with high - throughput genome manipulation required for systematic studies . As biological research goes quantitative , a simple and efficient method enabling minimally - invasive gene tagging is increasingly required . Here we describe an endonuclease - driven approach for seamless gene tagging that makes use of efficient endogenous homologous recombination to completely remove from the genome all auxiliary sequences necessary for clonal selection during gene tagging . We demonstrate several applications of seamless tagging , including high - throughput strain construction and automated yeast genetics . Results Endonuclease - driven approach for seamless gene tagging We designed a strategy for chromosomal gene tagging that allows generating clones in which only the desired tag sequence is inserted into a specified genomic locus . The strategy is based on a tagging module in which the selection marker , flanked by specific endonuclease cleavage sites , is placed between two copies of the tag sequence ( Figure 1A ) . First , the module is amplified by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) using primers with short overhangs homologous to the genomic locus of interest . This allows integration of the module into the target locus by homologous recombination ( PCR - targeting ) . Following correct module integration , the marker can be excised by inducing expression of the site - specific endonuclease . The resulting double - strand break ( DSB ) can then be repaired by homologous recombination between the two copies of the tag sequence . This should effectively remove all auxiliary sequences from the integrated module , leaving a single copy of the tag in the genome ( Figure 1A ) . We implemented this strategy in the budding yeast S . cerevisiae using the I - SceI meganuclease for sequence - specific DNA double - strand cleavage . I - SceI targets a rare 18 - base pair sequence absent from the PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 1 August 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 8 | e23794 nuclear genome of S . cerevisiae [ 14 ] and expression of I - SceI has no effect on yeast growth ( data not shown ) . We created modules for seamless protein tagging with the superfolder green fluorescent protein sfGFP [ 15 ] ( Figure 1B ) and the red fluorescent protein mCherry [ 16 ] ( Table S1 in Supporting Information S1 ) . The modules for C - terminal protein tagging contain a heterologous terminator , placed together with the selection marker between the I - SceI target sites , to ensure gene expression prior to marker excision ( Figure 1B - i , ii ) . Similarly , the modules for N - terminal tagging carry heterologous promoters to guarantee survival of strains with tagged essential genes prior to marker excision ( Figure 1B - iii ) . Two promoters of different strength were used to account for expression requirements of different essential genes . The URA3 gene was chosen as a selection marker as it allows both positive selection in medium lacking uracil and counter selection in medium containing 5 - fluoroorotic acid ( 5 - FOA ) . Demonstration of seamless tagging DSB repair can proceed through different mechanisms . However , seamless tagging is only possible if the DSB generated by I - SceI is repaired by homologous recombination within the module . We used a module for C - terminal protein tagging with sfGFP to determine the efficiency of seamless tagging ( Figure 1B - i ) . In this module the marker is placed between two overlapping parts of the sfGFP sequence , each producing non - fluorescent sfGFP fragments . A fluorescent protein fusion is only expressed when homologous recombination between the two partial sequences restores the full sfGFP sequence ( Figure 1B - i ) . This should allow monitoring the frequency of DSB repair specifically by homolo - gous recombination within the module . Using PCR - targeting for genomic integration , three genes ( PDC1 , NPL3 and PIL1 ) encoding abundant proteins [ 6 , 7 ] were tagged with this module in a strain expressing I - SceI from the inducible GAL1 promoter and in the corresponding wild type strain . Upon module integration , all strains expressed the respective proteins fused to truncated sfGFP and showed only background fluorescence , as determined from whole colony measurements with a fluorescence plate reader ( Figure 2A - i ) or from single - cell analysis with fluorescence microscopy ( Figure 2B , data not shown ) . Efficient repression of the GAL1 promoter by glucose in the medium ensured that spontaneous marker excision rarely occurred , as indicated by poor colony growth on plates containing 5 - FOA ( Figure 2A - ii ) , which selects for cells that have lost the URA3 marker . I - SceI expression was induced for 24 h by growing the strains on galactose plates ( Figure 2A - iii ) . Subsequent poor colony growth on plates lacking uracil ( SC - Ura ) indicated that most cells had lost the URA3 marker ( Figure 2A - iv ) . Formation of sfGFP - fluorescent colonies on galactose plates ( Figure 2A - iii ) indicated the occurrence of seamless marker excision events . Single - cell analysis with fluorescence microscopy revealed fluorescent protein fusions with expected localizations in . 96 % of the cells for all three tagged genes ( Figure 2B , C ) . Thus , DSBs generated by marker excision in the tagging module are repaired virtually exclusively via homologous recombination in S . cerevisiae . Subsequent growth on 5 - FOA plates ( Figure 2A - v ) completely purged sfGFP - negative cells from the fluorescent colonies for the three tested genes , PDC1 , NPL3 and PIL1 , thereby generating homogenous strains seamlessly tagged with sfGFP ( Figure 2B , C ) . Thus , sfGFP - negative cells did not carry out DSB repair by alternative mechanisms but failed to undergo marker excision . Together , these experiments demonstrate our approach and establish a robust workflow that should enable seamless tagging of most genes in S . cerevisiae . Influence of the genomic context on the efficiency of seamless tagging Identical sequences surrounding the marker in the tagging module allow for seamless marker excision . However , DSBs Figure 1 . Endonuclease - driven approach for seamless gene tagging by homologous recombination . ( A ) Schematic representation of seamless tagging . Module integration in S . cerevisiae is achieved by PCR - targeting : the module is amplified by PCR using primers with overhangs of 55 bases that target the module to the desired locus by homologous recombination . Endonuclease target sites are represented by black squares . ( B ) Modules for seamless protein tagging with sfGFP at the C - terminus ( i , ii ) or at the N - terminus ( iii ) ( Table S1 in Supporting Information S1 ) . The promoter and terminator sequences of the selection marker are not depicted for simplicity . Module i allows monitoring the frequency of seamless marker excision events ( see text for details ) . Modules i and ii begin with the S3 primer annealing site ( 5 9 - CGTACGCTGCAGGTCGAC - 3 9 ) and end with the S2 primer annealing site ( 5 9 - CGAGCTCGAATTCATCGAT - 3 9 ) , whereas module iii begins and ends with the S1 ( 5 9 - CGTACGCTGCAGGTCGAC - 3 9 ) and S4 ( 5 9 - CGACAGAGAATTCATCGATG - 3 9 ) sequences respectively . These sequences allow module amplification for PCR - targeting with standard S1 - S4 primers ( see reference [ 28 ] for details on primer design ) , for which an extensive list of modules with various tags is available [ 11 , 28 - 30 ] , and remain in the genome after seamless marker excision . However , the S1 - S4 primer annealing sites are not obligatory for seamless tagging . Thus , module i can be used for seamless tagging with a pair of primers that anneal to the start and to the end of the sfGFP sequence . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0023794 . g001 Seamless Gene Tagging PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 2 August 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 8 | e23794 induced by I - SceI could be potentially repaired by ectopic homologous recombination between similar sequences outside of the tagging module ( Figure 3A ) . We examined this possibility by tagging HXT6 , which shares 99 . 8 % of sequence identity over 1713 base pairs ( bp ) of coding sequence with the contiguous HXT7 open reading frame ( ORF ) ( Figure S2 in Supporting Information S1 ) . Strains with HXT6 tagged with sfGFP using the module for C - terminal protein tagging ( Figure 1B - i ) reproducibly contained , 15 % of non - fluorescent cells after seamless marker excision ( Figure 2C ) . This fraction did not change even after strain growth on 5 - FOA medium ( Figure 2A - v , C ) , indicating that the non - fluorescent cells had also lost the URA3 marker . PCR analysis revealed that the population of sfGFP - negative cells resulted from DSB repair by homologous recombination between the HXT6 and HXT7 sequences . As a consequence , the entire tagging module and one of the HXT genes were lost in these cells ( Figure S2 in Supporting Information S1 ) . We conclude that seamless tagging can be used in the context of repeated genomic sequences . However , ectopic homologous recombination between endoge - nous repetitive sequences competes with seamless marker excision events . In such cases , an additional purification step is sufficient to separate cells with seamlessly tagged loci from cells with alternative products of homologous recombination . We systematically assessed the potential impact of ectopic homologous recombination on seamless tagging in S . cerevisiae . The genomic context of each ORF was examined for the presence of identical or highly similar stretches longer than 28 bp , which can undergo homologous recombination [ 17 , 18 ] . Pairs of sequences flanking each tagging site were selected , confined by the nearest essential genetic elements , such that homologous recombination between the two sequences would not result in cell death ( Figure 3B ) . Analysis of sequence similarity within each pair revealed that ectopic recombination events could potentially interfere with seamless marker excision for only 1 – 4 % of all ORFs ( Figure 3C , Tables S4 and S5 in Supporting Information S1 ) . Therefore , our approach can be efficiently used for seamless tagging of the vast majority of yeast genes . High - throughput strain construction with seamless tagging Automation of yeast genetics with synthetic genetic array ( SGA ) technology [ 19 ] brought high throughput to yeast studies , from forward to reverse genetics to cell biological and biochemical analyses [ 20 ] . Importantly , seamless tagging is entirely compatible with SGA . Prior to marker excision , chromosomal gene fusions generated using the modules here described can be crossed into desired genetic backgrounds in high throughput with standard SGA methodology ( Figure S3 in Supporting Information S1 ) . Seamless marker excision in the generated strain arrays can then be carried out in batch with simple colony pinning on different growth media ( Figure 2A ) . The final strains with seamlessly tagged loci can then be analyzed without further validation ( Figure S3 in Supporting Information S1 ) . Therefore , high - throughput func - tional studies of gene fusions in the fully endogenous genomic context should be possible with seamless tagging . Preservation of endogenous transcriptional regulation with seamless N - terminal tagging C - terminal tagging without marker excision was previously used for systematic analysis of protein localization and abundance in S . cerevisiae [ 6 , 7 ] . However , proteins with critical signals at the C - terminus could not be analyzed in these studies . Seamless N - terminal tagging should allow to preserve endogenous promoters and to facilitate systematic analysis of proteins rendered non - Figure 2 . Demonstration of seamless tagging .

We established N - terminal tagging using four genes encoding tail - anchored proteins , which contain a C - terminal membrane insertion sequence . Each gene was tagged with two modules for seamless N - terminal protein tagging with sfGFP carrying different heterologous promoters ( Figure 1B - iii ) . Prior to marker excision , the corresponding protein fusions were expressed either under the control of the stronger TEF1 promoter or the weaker NOP1 promoter and localized correctly to the endoplasmic reticulum ( Cyb5 and Hlj1 ) or the mitochondria ( Fis1 ) [ 21 ] ( Figure 4A , B ) . Seamless marker excision led to expression of each protein from the respective endogenous promoter , as indicated by altered expression levels ( Figure 4A , B ) . Moreover , marker excision followed by recover of the endogenous promoter also restored pheromone - inducible expression sfGFP - Prm3 , which localized correctly to the nuclear envelope [ 22 ] ( Figure 4A , B ) . Therefore , seamless tagging enables expression of N - terminal protein fusion from their endogenous promoters . Preservation of endogenous downstream regulatory sequences with seamless C - terminal tagging Maximal preservation of the genomic context of seamlessly tagged loci opens new avenues for functional analysis of non - coding genetic elements in transcriptional or translational control . Regulation of the meiosis - specific IME4 transcript by an antisense RNA , initiated downstream of the ORF , provides a paradigmatic example for demonstration of functional analysis of non - coding sequences with seamless tagging . In haploid yeast cells , the antisense IME4 transcript silences sense IME4 transcription via transcrip - tional interference . This precludes expression of the Ime4 protein , thus preventing haploids from entering the meiotic program [ 23 ] . Figure 4 . Preservation of endogenous gene regulation with seamless tagging .

Representative images of strains expressing the indicated proteins fused at the N - terminus to sfGFP before and after seamless marker excision .

Influence of the genomic context on seamless marker excision . ( A ) Alternative routes of DSB repair upon marker excision . The two copies of the tag sequence ( indicated in green ) surrounding the marker in the tagging module allow for seamless marker excision .

( B , C ) Genome - wide analysis of local sequence similarities with potential for ectopic module excision during seamless tagging . ( B ) Schematic representation of pairs of sequences examined for sequence similarity for each ORF . Each pair was defined flanking the insertion site of the tagging module such that homologous recombination between the two sequences cannot result in excision of any essential genetic elements . Excision of an essential element would lead to its loss from the genome and cell death , thereby preventing the persistence of such alternative products of DSB repair in a population undergoing seamless marker excision . ( C ) Distribution of S . cerevisiae ORFs according to the length of identical ( black dots ) or highly similar ( grey dots ) sequences flanking the tagging site for each ORF , within the boundaries defined in ( B ) . ORFs within the orange area of the plots are flanked by identical or highly similar stretches longer than 28 bases . These stretches are expected to undergo homologous recombination upon production of a DSB within the seamless tagging module [ 17 , 18 ] , leading to undesired excision of the entire module . Potentially , reduced efficiency of seamless marker excision might be observed for as many as 250 ORFs ( Tables S4 and S5 in Supporting Information S1 ) . The frequency of undesired DSB repair events will depend on the context of each genomic locus , the length of identical or similar stretches flanking the tagging site [ 17 , 18 ] and the used seamless tagging module . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0023794 . g003 Seamless Gene Tagging PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 5 August 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 8 | e23794 We tagged IME4 with sfGFP using a module for seamless C - terminal protein tagging ( Figure 1B - ii ) and analyzed Ime4 - sfGFP protein levels before and after marker excision . The bidirectional CYC1 terminator , placed together with the marker between the endonuclease target sites in the tagging module , is expected to block antisense transcription ( Figure 4C ) . Accordingly , Ime4 - sfGFP fusion could be detected in haploid cells prior to but not after marker ( and CYC1 terminator ) excision ( Figure 4C ) . This demonstrates that seamless tagging allows preserving the regula - tory function of sequences downstream of an ORF and suggests an application of seamless tagging in functional analysis of antisense transcription . Discussion Quantitative understanding of biological systems requires measurements of the dynamics of the underlying processes with subcellular resolution . Gene tagging facilitates local measurements of protein or RNA abundance and behavior in living cells . Importantly , a tag should not compromise the native function of labeled molecules , nor should it interfere with their regulation . However , existing methods for gene tagging either disrupt endogenous gene regulatory sequences [ 2 , 11 ] or are incompatible with high - throughput genome manipulation [ 12 , 13 ] ( Figure S1 in Supporting Information S1 ) . Here we describe an approach that addresses these problems and enables seamless gene tagging for high - throughput functional studies . Our approach allows seamless insertion of a tag sequence into the genome ( Figure 1 ) , thus preserving endogenous gene regulation ( Figures 4 ) . On account of highly efficient DSB repair by homologous recombination , seamless tagging in S . cerevisiae requires that only the initial integration of the tagging module is validated for the vast majority of genes ( Figure 3 ) . Strains with validated integrations can be repeatedly used for genetic crossing to systematically introduce additional genome alterations such as gene deletions or other tagged genes ( Figure S3 in Supporting Information S1 ) . Prior to functional analysis , endogenous expression of tagged genes can be efficiently reconstituted with seamless marker excision using simple replica plating ( Figure 2 ) . The combination of seamless tagging with SGA technology [ 19 , 24 ] for high - throughput strain construction should facilitate systematic functional analysis of gene products in a minimally - perturbed context . Signal sequences within three prime untranslated regions influence mRNA localization , turnover or translational control [ 25 , 26 ] . Moreover , antisense transcription of ORFs is proposed to regulate expression of a significant fraction of the genome [ 27 ] . Seamless tagging should allow not only to preserve endogenous regulation , but also to analyze such gene regulatory signals through selective disruption of regulatory motifs without further alterations of the genomic context ( Figure 4C ) . We demonstrate seamless protein tagging with sfGFP in S . cerevisiae and supply similar modules for seamless N - terminal and C - terminal protein tagging with the red fluorescent protein mCherry ( Table S1 in Supporting Information S1 ) . Additional modules can be easily constructed , provided that the tag sequence is sufficiently long to support efficient DSB repair by homologous recombination after marker excision [ 18 ] . Seamless tagging could thus be extended for internal protein tagging or RNA labeling , among other applications . Given the ease of implementation and clear advantages , we expect seamless tagging to be widely used in yeast and potentially in other model systems . Materials and Methods Plasmid construction All plasmids used in this study are listed in Table S1 in Supporting Information S1 . Details of plasmid construction and plasmid sequences are available upon request . Briefly , the plasmids encoding the tagging modules ( Figure 1B , Table S1 in Supporting Information S1 ) were designed to contain the S1 / S4 ( for N - terminal tagging ) or S2 / S3 ( for C - terminal tagging ) primer annealing sites for PCR - targeting [ 28 ] , for which an extensive list of modules with various tags is available [ 11 , 28 – 30 ] . Thus , primers used for gene tagging with previously published modules can be used for seamless tagging with the modules described in this manuscript . Yeast codon - optimized sequences coding for the superfolder green fluorescent protein sfGFP [ 15 ] and the red fluorescent protein mCherry [ 16 ] were obtained by full gene synthesis . sfGFP D C in the N - terminal tagging modules ( plasmids pMaM173 and pMaM189 ) ( Table S1 in Supporting Information S1 ) is 180 bp long and encodes the first 60 amino acids of sfGFP . sfGFP D C in the C - terminal tagging module ( plasmid pMaM177 ) ( Table S1 in Supporting Information S1 ) is 614 bp long and encodes the first 204 amino acids of sfGFP . sfGFP D N is 291 bp long and encodes the last 97 amino acids of sfGFP , overlapping in 191 bp with sfGFP D C ( plasmid pMaM177 ) ( Table S1 in Supporting Information S1 ) . mCherry D C is 439 bp long and encodes the first 146 amino acids of mCherry ( plasmids pMaM172 and pMaM188 ) , whereas mCherry D N is 275 bp long and encodes the last 91 amino acids of mCherry ( plasmid pMaM174 ) ( Table S1 in Supporting Information S1 ) . The GAL1 - I - SCEI sequence was amplified from pGSHU [ 12 ] and cloned into pRS305N [ 31 ] to generate the plasmid pND32 ( Table S1 in Supporting Information S1 ) . The NOP1 promoter , the TEF1 promoter ( also known as EF - 1 alpha promoter ) and the CYC1 terminator used in the tagging modules were amplified from genomic DNA of Saccharomyces paradoxus , a yeast species closely related to Saccharomyces cerevisiae . These genetic elements retain their function in S . cerevisiae but differ in sequence from those present in the S . cerevisiae genome . This allows minimizing erroneous recombination between the tagging modules and the host genome in the first step of tagging by PCR - targeting . Instead of the commonly used klURA3 gene from the yeast Kluyveromyces lactis , we used the ScURA3 gene of S . cerevisiae , amplified from pRS416 [ 32 ] , as a selection marker . Use of klURA3 in the tagging modules did not support normal growth of transformed cells on selective medium without uracil , thereby decreasing the overall transformation efficiency ( data not shown ) . Importantly , use of ScURA3 had no effect on the efficiency of PCR - targeting of the modules in the strains used in this study , in which the chromosomal URA3 locus is fully deleted ( Table S2 in Supporting Information S1 ) . Moreover , seamless tagging was still efficient in S288c background containing the ura3 - 52 allele ( data not shown ) , indicating low frequency of module mistargeting due to undesirable recombination between ura3 - 52 and the tagging modules . Yeast strain construction All yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table S2 in Supporting Information S1 . All strain manipulations – gene tagging and gene deletion – were performed using standard procedures based on PCR - targeting , as previously described [ 28 ] . The natNT2 - GAL1 - I - SCEI construct , which allows conditional expression of the I - SceI endonuclease and carries the nat marker for nourseothricin resistance , was amplified from pND32 ( Table Seamless Gene Tagging PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 6 August 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 8 | e23794 S1 in Supporting Information S1 ) using primers listed in Table S3 in Supporting Information S1 . The obtained PCR product was integrated into the leu2 D 0 locus in two SGA entry strains of opposite mating types ( Y8205 and YST288 , Table S2 in Supporting Information S1 ) . For strains in which the LEU2 locus is not fully deleted , transformation with pND32 linearized with Bsp HI or Ssp I allows integration of the natNT2 - GAL1 - I - SCEI construct into a mutated leu2 locus or the wild type LEU2 locus . PCR - targeting requires module amplification by PCR using primers with overhangs of 45 - 55 bases homologous to the target genomic locus . PCR amplification of the modules for seamless tagging is challenging due to the presence of the tandem repeat of the tag sequence . We routinely used the Herculase II Fusion DNA polymerase ( Stratagene ) with optimized amplification conditions ( Protocol S1 in Supporting Information S1 ) . Direct transformation of 5 m l of PCR reaction product typically yielded 10 – 100 transformants . Occasionally , a background of transiently transformed cells obscured the correct colonies , as observed with other PCR - targeting modules [ 11 ] . Replica - plating followed by one day of growth removed the background , thus simplifying picking of single colonies . Correct integration of all modules was validated prior to seamless marker excision by PCR and by fluorescence microscopy , when appropriate ( Figure 4A ) . Seamless marker excision and SGA crossing Strains with validated integration of seamless tagging modules were grown to saturation ( 24 h at 30 u C ) in liquid synthetic complete medium containing 2 % glucose ( ‘‘glucose’’ ) in 96 - well format . Using a RoToR pinning robot ( Singer Instruments ) , the cells were spotted on ‘‘glucose’’ plates ( Figure 2A ) and incubated for 24 h at 30 u C . For SGA crossing , the strains were then mated for 24 h on ‘‘glucose’’ plates with partner strains of the opposite mating type containing the desired genomic manipulations ( e . g . gene deletions ) . Subsequent selection of diploids , sporulation of diploids and selection of haploids containing simultaneously the seamless tagging module , the natNT2 - GAL1 - I - SCEI construct and the desired genomic manipulation were performed as previously described [ 24 ] . For seamless marker excision , the colonies were pinned onto ‘‘galactose’’ plates ( synthetic complete medium containing 2 % galactose and 2 % raffinose ) to induce expression of I - SceI and grown for 24 h at 30 u C . Subsequent pinning onto synthetic glucose medium lacking uracil ( SC - Ura ) was used to assess the efficiency of marker excision . Pinning from ‘‘galac - tose’’ medium onto synthetic medium containing 5 - fluoroorotic acid ( 5 - FOA ) was used to remove cells that had not lost the ScURA3 marker ( Figure 2A – C ) . The frequency of seamless marker excision events and the efficiency of the 5 - FOA counter selection steps were assessed by fluorescence microscopy ( Figure 2B ) and seamless marker excision was ultimately validated by PCR . Whole colony imaging and fluorescence microscopy Whole colony fluorescence imaging ( Figure 2A ) was performed on an IS4000MM - Pro imager ( Kodak ) equipped with an integrated 4 - megapixel CCD camera and filters for GFP fluorescence imaging ( excitation : 470 , emission : 535 ) . In addition , the plates were imaged with a Perfection 3200 Photo scanner ( Epson ) to evaluate colony growth ( Figure 2A ) . Fluorescence microscopy was performed at room temperature on a DM RXA upright microscope ( Leica ) equipped with a CoolSNAP cf camera ( Photometrics ) , a 63x 1 . 4NA objective and an L5 filter cube ( excitation : BP480 / 40 , dichroic : 505 , suppres - sion : BP527 / 30 ) ( Figure 2B ) or at 30 u C on a DeltaVision RT system ( Applied Precision ) as described [ 33 ] ( Figure 4A , Figure S3 in Supporting Information S1 ) . All strains were grown and imaged in synthetic complete glucose medium . sfGFP - PRM3 cells ( after seamless marker excision ) were incubated with a - factor phero - mone ( 10 m g / ml final concentration ) for 2 . 5 h before imaging ( Figure 4A ) . Sequence homology analysis The reference genome sequence of S . cerevisiae and its annotation were retrieved from the Saccharomyces genome database ( SGD , www . yeastgenome . org ) , with the timestamp 2011 - 02 - 15 . Additionally , the growth phenotype ( viable or inviable ) of strains with single gene deletions was retrieved from SGD . The centromeres and the telomeres were considered essential genetic elements ( inviable phenotype upon deletion ) . The sequence homology search was performed in R / Bioconduc - tor [ 34 ] using the Biostrings package . Shortly , for each verified or uncharacterized ORF two sequences flanking the desired tagging site ( immediately after the start codon for N - terminal tagging and immediately before the stop codon for C - terminal tagging ) were extracted from the chromosomal sequences . Each pair of sequences was defined with the nearest essential genetic elements as boundaries ( Figure 3B ) and compared using a pair wise alignment method based on the Smith - Waterman algorithm ( pairwiseAlignment in the Biostrings package ) . Only the best alignment was reported and the longest uninterrupted stretch of sequence identity in the alignment was subsequently determined .
