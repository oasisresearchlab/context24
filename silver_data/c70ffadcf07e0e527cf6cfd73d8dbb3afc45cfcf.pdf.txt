To further characterize the protection from capping , 6 Department of Molecular and Medical Genetics University of Toronto we examined the effects of FH1FH2 on elongation from preformed F - actin ( spectrin - actin seeds , which provide Toronto , Ontario M5S 1A8 Canada a barbed end for actin assembly ) in a G - actin concentra - tion too low to allow FH1FH2 to nucleate new filaments .

FH1FH2 Protects the Barbed End from Capping by Capping Proteins ( A ) FH1FH2 ( 75 nM ) was added to 2 (cid:3) M Mg - actin ( 25 % labeled ) in the absence ( open black diamonds ) or presence of capping pro - tein ( 10nM ) ( closedblackdiamonds ) , andpo - lymerization was followed from the pyreny - lactin fluorescence .

( B ) To determine the relative number of ends produced by FH1FH2 under the conditions describedin Figure2A , FH1FH2 ( 75 nM ) incu - bated with Mg - actin for 150 s was diluted 25 - fold into pyrenylactin ( 1 (cid:3) M ) without ( open red squares ) or with 10 nM capping protein ( closed red squares ) . At the diluted concen - tration ( 3 nM ) , FH1FH2 did not nucleate new filaments in 1 (cid:3) M actin over the time period involved ( open black triangles ) . ( C ) Spectrin - actin seeds ( 1 nM ) were incu - bated for 3 min in the absence ( left set ) or presenceof200nMFH1FH2 ( rightset ) before addition of 0 . 6 (cid:3) M Mg - pyrenylactin in the ab - sence ( light bars ) or presence ( dark bars ) of 10 nM capping protein , and the rate of elon - gation , expressed as a percent of seeds alone , was determined between 0 and 120 s . ( D ) Spectrin - actinseeds were incubatedfor 5 min with different concentrations of FH1FH2 and then assayed for rate of elongation in 1 (cid:3) M pyrenylactin ( closed blue squares ) or then mixed with 10 nM capping protein for 30 s ( closed red circles ) or 30 min ( closed green diamonds ) before assaying elongation between 15 and 60 s ( expressed as percent of seeds alone ) . The calculated steady - state values ( using capping protein K d (cid:4) 0 . 3 nM , FH1FH2 K d (cid:4) 20 nM and 1 nM seeds ) are shown by the open circles . examined by epifluorescence microscopy . The elonga - The maximal on rate for FH1FH2 is diffusion limited , i . e . , 10 / (cid:3) M / s . The loss of FH1FH2 from the end of the tion ( identified by TRITC label alone ) from the seeds ( labeled brightly with Alexa and dimly with TRITC ) was filament during elongation reflects the sum of dissocia - tion of FH1FH2 and movement of FH1FH2 to an interior unidirectional ( Figure 2A ) . The distribution of Alexa - labeled filament lengths is position due to G - actin addition . The latter has an on rate of 5 / (cid:3) M / s ( half the normal rate ) so at 1 (cid:3) M G - actin , shown in Figure 2B . By scoring only filaments labeled with Alexa , we avoided any filaments nucleated sponta - a pseudo first - order rate of 5 / s . This predicts a K d of (cid:5) ( 5 / s ) / ( 10 / (cid:3) M / s ) or 0 . 5 (cid:3) M ( dependent on [ G - actin ] ) , neously or by FH1FH2 or capping protein . The median length of the TRITC labeled region was 4 . 9 (cid:3) m ( mean (cid:6) which contrasts with the observed K d of 20 nM . Similar arguments were made for insertin , a fragment of tensin , SD (cid:4) 5 . 5 (cid:6) 3 (cid:3) m ) . Seeds elongating in the presence of 200nMFH1FH2hadashorter , tighterlengthdistribution , which is also a leaky cap [ 4 ] . We investigated whether the formin could move to median 2 . 6 (cid:3) m ( 2 . 9 (cid:6) 1 . 8 (cid:3) m ) . This is consistent with the elongation of each filament being slowed by FH1FH2 . keep up with a barbed end that was elongating rapidly . If it was unable to keep up , it would no longer inhibit Seeds elongating in the presence of 10 nM capping protein were rapidly inhibited , median 0 . 3 (cid:3) m ( 0 . 5 (cid:6) 1 . 1 elongation . Bni1p FH2 behaves similarly to FH1FH2 with the exception that it cannot utilize profilin - actin for nu - (cid:3) m ) . FH1FH2 incubated with seeds for 1 min before addition of capping protein partially protected the ends cleation [ 3 ] ( Figures S3 and S4 ) . This allowed us to use profilin - actin to increase the rate of elongation . The ratio from capping during the subsequent elongation period , increasing the median from 0 . 3 to 1 . 8 (cid:3) m ( 1 . 9 (cid:6) 1 . 1 (cid:3) m ) . of profilin to actin was adjusted to keep the free G - actin at 0 . 5 (cid:3) M , and the total G - actin concentration was in - Incomplete protection is expected over this time period because as the FH1FH2 comes off the end , it must creased to 6 (cid:3) M ; under these conditions FH2 caused no nucleation . The rate of barbed - end elongation of control compete with capping protein to rebind . These results support and extend the conclusions from the biochemi - seeds was , as expected , proportional to the sum of the concentrations of free G - actin and profilin - actin ( Figure cal studies : FH1FH2 slows barbed - end elongation but protects the barbed end from capping by capping 3 ) . The extent of inhibition by FH2 was independent of the rate of elongation . Thus , the formin can keep up protein .

Current Biology 1822 Figure 3 . Inhibition of Elongation by FH2 Is Independent of Rate of Elongation The initial rate of elongation ( 0 – 120 s ) was determined for spectrin - actin seeds alone ( closed blue squares ) or in the presence of 200 nM FH2 ( closed red diamonds ) in 0 . 5 , 3 , or 6 (cid:3) M G - actin ( 25 % labeled ) plus enough profilin to reduce the free G - actin in each case to 0 . 5 (cid:3) M ( determined by the concentration required to inhibit pointed - end elongation from gelsolin seeds ) . Controls , in the ab - sence of seeds , monitored the extent of nucleation by FH2 in each condition ( open green circles ) . The lines are best fits ( R 2 (cid:5) 0 . 99 ) ; the FH2 slope is 64 % of control slope . FH2 Is a Tetramer To be processive , a cap , like a motor , presumably has to maintain a foothold on the filament while it moves . An oligomer of at least two FH2 domains may be essen - tial for the FH2 to walk along the filament , with one molecule keeping the complex attached to the filament while the other repositions itself . Static light scattering ( SLS ) analysis provides an absolute measurement of the size of the complex independent of molecular shape [ 7 ] . Anexperimentalmolecularweightof260 , 500Da ( (cid:6) 3000 ) was observed for FH1FH2 , which indicates that FH1FH2 adopts a tetrameric configuration since the polypeptide molecular weight is 67 , 600 Da ( Figure 4A ) . FH2 alone also formed a tetramer based on SLS analysis ( Figure 4 ) . FH1FH2 fragments of the mammalian formin mDia1 also oligomerize [ 8 ] , and Bni1p FH2 crystallizes as a dimer ( M . Eck , personal communication ) . Figure 2 . Filament Length Distribution Confirms FH1FH2 Inhibition How Does FH1FH2 Work As a Leaky Cap ? of Elongation and Protection from Capping by Capping Proteins Together , these data support the view that the Bni1p ( A ) Shown are examples of filaments grown from Alexa - labeled cap is processive and walks along with the end as it spectrin - actin seeds ( green ) ( see Experimental Procedures in the elongates ( Movie S1 ) .

Y axis is the percent Rather , it appears that the Bni1p FH2 prefers a binding of total filaments with length in the bins described in (cid:3) m on the x surface only available at the barbed end of the filament . axis . The first bin is the fraction of filaments that grew 0 . 5 (cid:3) m or During elongation , as the barbed end binds the next less and the second bin , any that grew between 0 . 5 and 1 (cid:3) m , etc . G - actin , the site binding FH2 switches from “end” to At least 50 filaments were measured for each variable . “internal , ” which decreases its affinity for FH2 . But as the FH2 comes off this site , it remains attached to the filament’s other side by the second FH2 , allowing the The formin Cdc12 also appears to remain at the barbed end and prevent annealing , while the filaments are elon - free FH2 to reattach to the new end . The ability to move rapidly is reasonable for a processive cap given that the gating rapidly in the presence of profilin - actin [ 5 ] . In S . cerevisiae , the actin cable , which is nucleated by a for - on rate is now effectively an internal rearrangement of an existing molecular complex . As a result , it is indepen - min , is observed to elongate at (cid:5) 100 monomers / s [ 6 ] . Bni1p Protects Filament Barbed End from Cappers 1823 by FH1FH2 . Until the FH1FH2 comes off ( a half - time of (cid:1) 30 s ) , the end is protected from capping protein and can elongate , albeit at a reduced rate . The duration of protection is longer than the estimated half - time of free filaments in neutrophil cytoplasm ( (cid:1) 1 s ) [ 9 ] ; comparable values in yeast are not known . Furthermore , when the formin comes off the barbed end , whether capping pro - tein or another formin binds depends on their local con - centrations . In yeast , Bni1p is concentrated at the bud tip where the barbed endsof actin cables are also found . Thus , one Bni1p molecule after another may occupy the barbed end for an extended period of time allowing these filaments to continue to elongate even while an - chored to the bud tip .
