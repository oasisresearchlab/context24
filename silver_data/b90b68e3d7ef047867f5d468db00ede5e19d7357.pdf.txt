All known sensing mechanisms rely on protein domains with speci ﬁ c structural features such as wedge - like amphipathic helices and crescent - shaped BAR domains . Yet many proteins that contain these domains also contain large intrinsically disordered regions . Here we report that disordered domains are themselves potent sensors of membrane curvature . Comparison of Monte Carlo simulations with in vitro and live - cell measurements demonstrates that the polymer - like behavior of disordered domains found in endocytic proteins drives them to partition preferentially to convex membrane surfaces , which place fewer geometric con - straints on their conformational entropy . Further , proteins containing both structured cur - vature sensors and disordered regions are more than twice as curvature sensitive as their respective structured domains alone . These ﬁ ndings demonstrate an entropic mechanism of curvature sensing that is independent of protein structure and illustrate how structured and disordered domains can synergistically enhance curvature sensitivity .

Formation of these structures requires that proteins with the capacity to generate membrane curvature assemble together at speci ﬁ c locations on cellular membrane surfaces 2 , 3 . These proteins are thought to sense the curvature of the surrounding membrane and bind preferentially to curved sites , progressively enhancing membrane curvature . Two primary mechanisms of curvature sensing have been well - characterized : ( i ) membrane scaffolding by crescent - shaped BAR ( Bin / Amphiphysin / Rvs ) domains 4 , which match their curvature to that of the membrane , and ( ii ) detection of membrane defects by amphipathic helices 5 , which insert like wedges between the head groups of lipids found in highly curved membrane surfaces . Both of these mechanisms rely on speci ﬁ c protein structural features . However , these structured domains frequently constitute only a small fraction of the mass of the protein molecules that contain them . Speci ﬁ cally , large intrinsically disordered protein ( IDP ) domains , which lack well - de ﬁ ned secondary structures 6 , are often also present within the same protein molecules . Several examples of multi - domain proteins that couple structured cur - vature sensors with substantial regions of intrinsic disorder are found in the clathrin - mediated endocytic pathway . Speci ﬁ cally , Epsin1 consists of an ENTH ( Epsin N - terminal homology 7 ) domain , which contains a curvature - sensing amphipathic helix , followed by a disordered domain of more than 400 amino acids 8 . Similarly , AP180 consists of a curvature sensing ANTH ( AP180 N - terminal homology 9 ) domain , followed by an intrinsically disordered domain of more than 500 amino acids 8 , 10 . BAR domains are also frequently found in combination with sub - stantial disordered regions . For example , Amphiphysin1 contains a crescent - shaped N - BAR ( N - terminal BAR ) domain 4 but also contains a substantial disordered region of nearly 400 amino acids 11 . In studies of curvature sensing , structured domains have nearly always been studied in isolation from disordered regions based on the assumption that a well - de ﬁ ned structure is required for cur - vature sensing . However , the polymer - like behavior of many well - solvated IDP domains 12 – 14 suggests a potential role in curvature sensing . Speci ﬁ cally , tethering a polymer - like molecule to a sur - face is known to signi ﬁ cantly reduce its entropy by restricting the number of conformations available to it 13 – 15 . However , this loss can in principle be partially recovered by tethering polymers to convex surfaces , which curve toward them . Here the entropy of the polymer chain would be expected to increase as the convex curvature of the substrate increases , potentially driving parti - tioning of tethered polymers to more highly curved substrates . Entropic mechanisms of curvature sensing have not been explored to date . However , it is increasingly recognized that intrinsically disordered domains are integral components of many proteins involved in membrane remodeling and coated - vesicle biogenesis 11 , 16 , 17 . Motivated by this reasoning , here we ask whether membrane - bound IDPs can sense membrane curvature using entropic mechanisms . To investigate the ability of disordered domains to sense membrane curvature , we measure membrane binding as a func - tion of vesicle diameter ( 20 – 200 nm ) for the disordered domains of AP180 , Epsin1 , and Amiphiphysin1 . In each case we ﬁ nd a substantial increase in binding as membrane curvature increases , the level of which is comparable to the established structure - based curvature sensors , ENTH and N - BAR . Further , curvature sensing by IDP domains decreases with increasing rigidity of the peptide chain , in agreement with Monte Carlo simulations that capture the impact of substrate curvature on chain entropy . Further , we investigate the ability of IDP domains to sense membrane cur - vature when displayed on the plasma membrane of live mammalian cells . By analyzing the differential partitioning of these domains between highly curved ﬁ lopodia and the relatively ﬂ at plasma membrane , we ﬁ nd that IDPs exhibit increased par - titioning to the convex outer ﬁ lopodial surface and reduced partitioning to the concave inner surface . Finally , examining full - length endocytic proteins reveals that disordered and structured curvature sensing domains present in the same protein work together synergistically , more than doubling the curvature sen - sitivity of any individual domain , structured or disordered . Taken together this work demonstrates that IDP domains are a critical , yet previously unknown , class of curvature sensors . These ﬁ nd - ings fundamentally alter our understanding of how proteins sense membrane curvature by demonstrating a previously unknown entropic mechanism of curvature sensing that can substantially amplify the performance of previously identi ﬁ ed structured cur - vature sensors . Therefore , this work necessitates a substantial expansion and reexamination of the set of proteins responsible for sensing the curvature of membrane structures in diverse biological processes . Results The disordered domain of AP180 senses membrane curvature . AP180 , an adaptor protein in the clathrin - mediated endocytic pathway , is one of several proteins responsible for assembly of the clathrin coat during vesicle biogenesis 18 – 20 . AP180 ’ s intrinsically disordered C - terminal domain lacks substantial regions of sec - ondary structure and is highly water soluble 8 , 10 , 21 . The disordered structure of AP180 ’ s C - terminal domain has been veri ﬁ ed using multiple experimental techniques , including circular dichroism spectroscopy 8 , NMR spectroscopy 10 , ﬂ uorescence correlation spectroscopy 21 , gel ﬁ ltration 8 , and analytical ultracentrifugation 8 . Additionally , no signi ﬁ cant secondary structure in this domain , or other disordered domains considered in this work , was pre - dicted by computational sequence analysis ( Supplementary Figs . 1 – 3 ) . Therefore , we used the intrinsically disordered C - terminal domain of AP180 ( Rat AP180 , residues 328 – 896 ) as a model protein for evaluating the ability of IDP domains to sense membrane curvature . To attach this domain to membrane vesi - cles containing Ni - NTA DOGS lipids , we added an N - terminal hexa - histidine tag to AP180 ’ s C - terminal domain ( his - AP180CTD ) . The histidine - Ni interaction ensures that the dis - ordered domains bind to the membrane surfaces at their N - termini 22 . Importantly , his - AP180CTD did not bind measurably to membranes lacking DGS - NTA lipids ( Supplementary Fig . 4a - c ) , indicating that other residues or motifs within the disordered protein did not interact signi ﬁ cantly with the membrane . As a positive control for curvature sensing , we examined the wild - type Epsin N - terminal Homology domain ( wt - ENTH ) , which is known to sense membrane curvature by inserting its N - terminal amphipathic helix ( residues 1 – 16 ) into lipid packing defects present in highly curved membrane surfaces 23 . As a negative control , we removed ENTH ’ s curvature sensing helix and replaced it with a hexa - histidine tag ( his - Δ ENTH ) . A tethered vesicle assay , depicted in Fig . 1a , was used to measure the curvature sensing abilities of these proteins . Small unilamellar vesicles ( SUVs ) with diameters varying from 20 to 200 nm were tethered to a coverslip surface as described previously 5 ( see ' Methods ' ) . This range of vesicle diameters encompasses most curved biological membrane structures 2 . Protein containing solutions were then added to the tethered vesicles and binding of proteins to vesicle surfaces was observed using confocal ﬂ uorescence microscopy . SUVs contained the ﬂ uorophore Oregon Green 488 1 , 2 - dihexadecanoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphoethanolamine ( Oregon Green - DHPE ) , while proteins were labelled with ATTO - 594 , conjugated to lysine residues ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 018 - 06532 - 3 2 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2018 ) 9 : 4152 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 018 - 06532 - 3 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications Small unilamellar vesicle ( SUV ) Proteins Biotinylated - PEG layer Glass cover slip Merge Lipid Protein h i s - AP 180 C T D w t - E N T H a b c f e d Relative intensities Lipid Protein 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 0 50 100 150 200 N u m be r o f p r o t e i n s Vesicle diameter ( nm ) 5 nM 50 nm 100 nM 400 nM 4000 nM his - AP180CTD 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 0 50 100 150 200 R e l a t i v e c u r v a t u r e s en s i t i v i t y Vesicle diameter ( nm ) 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 0 50 100 150 200 N u m be r o f p r o t e i n s Vesicle diameter ( nm ) his - Δ ENTH ( 5 nM ) his - Δ ENTH ( 50 nM ) wt - ENTH ( 150 nM ) wt - ENTH ( 450 nM ) wt - ENTH ( 600 nM ) 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 0 50 100 150 200 R e l a t i v e c u r v a t u r e s en s i t i v i t y Vesicle diameter ( nm ) 5 nM 50 nm 100 nM 400 nM 4000 nM his - AP180CTD his - Δ ENTH ( 5 nM ) his - Δ ENTH ( 50 nM ) wt - ENTH ( 150 nM ) wt - ENTH ( 450 nM ) wt - ENTH ( 600 nM ) h i s - Δ E N T H Fig . 1 The disordered C - terminal domain of AP180 senses membrane curvature . a Schematic of the curvature sensing assay ( see text ) . b Lipid , protein , and merged ﬂ uorescent images of SUVs ( 30 nm extruded ) and membrane - bound proteins .

Binding of his - Δ ENTH , wt - ENTH , and his - AP180CTD to immobilized SUVs is depicted in Fig . 1b . For tethered vesicles exposed to his - Δ ENTH , the ratio of ﬂ uorescence intensities in the protein and lipid ﬂ uorescence channels was approximately constant across the range of SUV diameter , such that the SUVs appeared to have a uniform yellow color when the lipid ( green ) and protein ( red ) channels were merged ( Fig . 1b , top row ) . This constant ratio indicates a lack of curvature sensitivity , which is expected since the curvature sensing amphipathic helix is absent in his - Δ ENTH . In contrast , for wt - ENTH , brighter puncta in the lipid channel , which correspond to vesicles of larger diameter , had low protein to lipid channel intensity ratios , causing them to appear greener in merged images . Conversely , dimmer puncta in the lipid channel , which correspond to vesicles of smaller diameter , had high protein to lipid ratios , causing them to appear redder in merged images ( Fig . 1b , center ) . This distribution of intensity ratios indicates that wt - ENTH binds more strongly to more highly curved vesicles , which is expected owing to the presence of its amphipathic helix . Similarly to wt - ENTH , his - AP180CTD displayed sensitivity to membrane curvature , with protein to lipid channel intensity ratio increasing with decreasing vesicle diameter ( Fig . 1b , bottom ) . To quantify and compare the curvature sensitivity of these proteins , we used the ﬂ uorescent intensity of colocalized puncta in the lipid and protein ﬂ uorescent channels to estimate the number of membrane - bound proteins per SUV as a function of SUV diameter , Fig . 1c – f . We estimated SUV diameter by comparing the average Oregon Green DHPE ﬂ uorescence intensity per tethered vesicle to the average vesicle diameter obtained from dynamic light scattering , as described pre - viously 5 and detailed in the ' Methods ' section , Supplementary Figures 5 – 8 . We estimated the number of proteins bound to each vesicle by dividing the ﬂ uorescence intensity of each vesicle in the protein channel by the calibrated ﬂ uorescence intensity of a single dye - labeled protein as described in ' Methods ' , Supplementary Figures 8 – 9 . As expected , the number of bound proteins increased monotonically with increasing vesicle diameter ( Fig . 1c ) . Figure 1d plots relative curvature sensitivity as a function of SUV diameter . Here relative curvature sensitivity is de ﬁ ned as the normalized protein density , where the number of membrane - bound proteins per membrane area at each vesicle diameter is divided by the number of membrane - bound proteins per membrane area for vesicles of the reference diameter , 200 nm ( i . e . , density / density diameter = 200 ) . The curvature sensitivity of wt - ENTH is evident in Fig . 1d , as the density of membrane - bound proteins increases by 12 - fold for vesicles of 20 nm diameter in comparison to vesicles of 200 nm diameter , similar to previous observations for the wt - ENTH domain 23 and for isolated amphipathic helices 5 . However , as protein concentration in solution increased from 150 to 600 nM , curvature sensitivity declined owing to saturation of the membrane surface , as expected 24 . In contrast , the density of membrane - bound his - Δ ENTH proteins was relatively constant over all SUV diameters and protein concentrations , indicating a lack of curvature sensitivity , as expected . The lack of signi ﬁ cant curvature sensitivity by his - Δ ENTH indicates that the histidine - Ni - lipid interaction , which was also used to tether AP180CTD to membrane surfaces , does not in itself give rise to curvature sensing behavior . However , we cannot rule out the possibility that the histidine - lipid interaction may modify the local membrane entropy and thereby in ﬂ uence curvature sensing . Notably , protein concentrations and membrane composition were chosen to achieve comparable ranges of membrane binding for his - Δ ENTH and wt - ENTH ( Fig . 1 caption ) . In comparison , Fig . 1e depicts a monotonic increase in the amount of bound protein with increasing vesicle diameter for his - AP180CTD over a range of protein concentrations in solution . When SUVs were exposed to a 5 nM solution of his - AP180CTD ( Fig . 1f ) , the density of membrane - bound proteins was approxi - mately 10 - fold higher for 20 nm diameter vesicles in comparison to vesicles with 200 nm diameter . Similar to wt - ENTH , as the concentration of protein in solution increased from 5 to 4000 nM , curvature sensitivity steadily declined . The level of curvature sensitivity observed for his - AP180CTD is therefore comparable to that observed for wt - ENTH . Additionally , we compared a C - terminally his - tagged version of AP180CTD with the N - terminally his - tagged variant used in Figs . 1 and 2 ( Supplementary Fig . 10 ) , and observed nearly identical levels of curvature sensitivity . This result demonstrates that curvature sensing is not strongly dependent on the proximity of speci ﬁ c residues to the point of membrane attachment , as would be expected for a mechanism that depends primarily on molecular entropy rather than protein structural motifs . In the next section we quantify the impact of membrane curvature on the binding af ﬁ nity and capacity of his - AP180CTD . These results facilitate a direct comparison between the curvature sensitivity of disordered and structured curvature sensors . Impact of membrane curvature on IDP binding equilibria . Using the data in Fig . 1 , binding curves were generated to determine the impact of membrane curvature on the af ﬁ nity and capacity of AP180 - CTD binding to membrane surfaces , Fig . 2a and Supplementary Figure 11 . As curvature increased the apparent binding capacity appeared to saturate at increasing levels , while the apparent dissociation constant ( K D ) , progres - sively decreased , as indicated by the steepening of the initial slopes . To quantify these effects , we ﬁ t a Langmuir adsorption isotherm ( Eq . 1 ) to the binding curves , Protein bound ¼ B max AP180 ½ (cid:2) K D þ AP180 ½ (cid:2) ð 1 Þ where B max corresponds to the maximum of membrane - bound protein , [ AP180 ] is the his - AP180CTD concentration in solution , and K D is the dissociation constant . K D increased from 40 to 160 nM as SUV diameter increased from 30 to 200 nm , indicating that AP180CTD bound more strongly to vesicles of smaller diameter ( Fig . 2b ) . B max decreased from 5 to 2 . 6 × 10 − 3 proteins nm − 2 as SUV diameter increased from 30 to 200 nm ( Fig . 2c ) . We attribute this behavior to the geometrical effect illustrated in Fig . 2d . Speci ﬁ cally , if bound proteins occupy an approximately spherical plane that is located a radial distance equal to the average protein radius , r P , away from the SUV surface , then the fractional difference in surface area between this plane and the plane of the membrane surface increases with decreasing SUV diameter , leading to an increased binding capacity for small SUVs , as illustrated by Eq . 2 . A protein A vesicle ¼ r v þ r p (cid:1) (cid:3) 2 r 2 v ¼ B max B maxcorrected ð 2 Þ In Fig . 2c , B max and the corresponding B max corrected values , which were calculated from Eq . 2 , are plotted . An average B max corrected value of 2 . 7 × 10 − 3 proteins nm − 2 was obtained . For these B max corrected calculations , a value of 6 . 0 nm was used for r p , as measured by ﬂ uorescence correlation spectroscopy ( Supplemen - tary Figs . 12 – 13 , Supplementary Table 1 ) . This value of r p is in reasonable agreement with values reported for AP180CTD 8 , 21 , suggesting that each AP180CTD molecule occupies ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 018 - 06532 - 3 4 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2018 ) 9 : 4152 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 018 - 06532 - 3 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications approximately 115 nm 2 on the membrane surface . Due to the polymer - like nature of IDPs , r p is expected to vary with vesicle curvature . However , this variation is relatively small and does not alter the interpretation of the data ( Supplementary Fig . 14 ) . The fractional protein coverage on a membrane surface is equivalent to the probability that a protein binding site is occupied . Curvature sensitivity is reduced when this probability increases , as shown in Fig . 1d , f . Therefore , comparisons of the curvature sensitivity of two different proteins must occur under conditions for which each protein covers the same fraction of the membrane surface , averaged over the population of tethered vesicles . A detailed justi ﬁ cation of this equivalency criterion is included in the supplementary text ( Supplementary Equation 4 ) . By holding the membrane coverage constant , we effectively reduce the experimental system to a thermodynamic canonical ensemble in which the temperature , volume , and fraction of the membrane surface occupied by proteins are all held constant . Within this ensemble , curvature sensitivity is simply the relative favorable partitioning of proteins to vesicles of higher curvature . Using a membrane surface area value of 15 nm 2 for wt - ENTH 25 , 26 and 115 nm 2 for his - AP180CTD , the relative curvature sensitivities of these two proteins were compared under conditions for which each protein covered approximately 3 % of the SUV surfaces , averaged over the entire population of tethered vesicles ( Fig . 2e ) . Here , protein coverage is de ﬁ ned as the total projected area of proteins ( i . e . , number of proteins multiplied by area of a single protein ) divided by the total surface area of the vesicles . A protein coverage of 3 % represents a relatively dilute regime . Therefore protein – protein interactions were neglected . Comparing the curvature sensitivity of his - AP180CTD and wt - ENTH under these conditions reveals that they achieve 10 - fold and 8 - fold greater binding density to 20 nm vesicles in comparison to 200 nm vesicles , respectively . These results demonstrate that the IDP domain of AP180 has a similar sensitivity to membrane curvature in comparison to wt - ENTH , an established structure - based sensor of membrane curvature . To further demonstrate the ability of a random polymer to sense membrane curvature , we conjugated a 40 kDa polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) chain to histidine - tagged Green Fluorescent Protein ( his - GFP ) . The resulting shift in molecular weight was con ﬁ rmed using ﬂ uorescence correlation spectroscopy ( Supplementary Fig . 15 ) . When examined prior to conjugation with PEG , his - GFP displayed minimal curvature sensing abilities , similar to those of his - ENTH . However , following conjugation with PEG , we observed substantial curvature sensing ( Supplementary Fig . 16 ) . As a homopolymer lacking in secondary structural motifs and unable to bind to membranes directly ( Supplementary Fig . 4d - f ) , the ability of a PEG chain to impart curvature sensing abilities to GFP further suggests an entropic mechanism of curvature sensing . Therefore , we next probed the detailed mechanism behind the ability of intrinsically disordered domains to sense membrane curvature . 0 1 2 3 4 5 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 P r o t e i n bound ( p r o t e i n / 1000 n m 2 ) [ his - AP180CTD ] ( nM ) 30 nm SUVs 50 nm SUVs 100 nm SUVs 200 nm SUVs 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 0 50 100 150 200 Vesicle diameter ( nm ) b c a 0 50 100 150 200 2 . 0 2 . 5 3 . 0 3 . 5 4 . 0 4 . 5 5 . 0 5 . 5 Vesicle diameter ( nm ) B m a x ( p r o t e i n / 1000 n m 2 ) B max B max corrected K D ( n M ) d e 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 0 50 100 150 200 R e l a t i v e c u r v a t u r e s en s i t i v i t y Vesicle diameter ( nm ) his - Δ ENTH wt - ENTH his - AP180CTD r v r p Fig . 2 Impact of membrane curvature on IDP binding equilibria . a Binding curves for his - AP180CTD . b Regressed values for the dissociation constant ( K D ) as a function of SUV diameter . c Regressed values for maximal protein binding ( B max ) as a function of SUV diameter , and the corrected values after geometrical effects are removed .

There are at least two potential explanations for the ability of IDPs to sense membrane curvature . One possible explanation is proposed in the introduction of this report — that curved sub - strates allow greater conformational entropy of the disordered amino acid chain of the IDP . However , a second possible explanation is that curved surfaces , which increase the volume available per IDP chain , reduce electrostatic repulsions between neighboring membrane - bound IDPs , leading to increased binding to curved membrane surfaces . Notably , the IDP domain of AP180 contains 11 % charged residues and has a net charge of approxi - mately negative 30 near neutral pH , such that chain – chain and residue – residue electrostatic interactions may be signi ﬁ cant . Importantly , we would expect these two mechanisms , one relying on chain entropy and the other relying on chain – chain repulsion , to yield opposite outcomes as electrostatic screening increases . Speci ﬁ cally , screening charges on the IDP chain by increasing the salt concentration in solution would be expected to decrease residue – residue repulsion , leading to a less rigid , more compact IDP chain with larger conformational entropy . Therefore , if curvature sensitivity arises primarily from chain entropy , then increasing salt concentration would be expected to increase cur - vature sensitivity . In contrast , increasing salt concentration would decrease the electrostatic repulsion between chains , such that curvature sensitivity should decrease if it arises primarily from chain – chain repulsion . To examine the relative contributions of the chain entropy and chain – chain repulsion mechanisms to curvature sensitivity , we measured the curvature sensitivity of membrane - bound AP180CTD as a function of salt concentration . First we used ﬂ uorescence correlation spectroscopy to measure the impact of sodium chloride concentration , ranging from 10 to 450 mM , on the relative dimensions of AP180CTD proteins diffusing freely in 3D solution ( Supplementary Figs . 12 and 13 ) . Figure 3a and Supplementary Table 1 show that the hydrodynamic radius of AP180CTD decreases from 6 . 7 to 5 . 6 nm with increasing salt concentration in this range . In contrast , transferrin , which we used as a globular control protein , changed negligibly in size over the same range of salt concentration ( Supplementary Figures 13g - h and Supplementary Table 1 ) . This result suggests that increasing salt concentration decreases the chain rigidity of AP180CTD . Next we compared the sensitivity of AP180CTD to membrane curvature over the same range of salt concentration . As displayed in Fig . 3b , relative curvature sensitivity increased approximately two - fold when the concentration of sodium chloride in the surrounding solution was raised from 10 to 450 mM . This result suggests that the impact of membrane curvature on chain entropy , rather than on chain – chain repulsion , is the a d b c 1 2 3 1 2 1 . 0 2 . 0 3 . 0 4 . 0 5 . 0 6 . 0 25 50 75 100 125 150 175 200 R e l a t i v e c u r v a t u r e s en s i t i v i t y Vesicle diameter ( nm ) Simulation l K = 0 . 36 nm l K = 0 . 43 nm l K = 0 . 66 nm Experiment 10 mM NaCl 150 mM NaCl 450 mM NaCl 0 . 0 4 . 5 5 . 0 5 . 5 6 . 0 6 . 5 7 . 0 7 . 5 10 mM R ad i u s ( n m ) Experiment Simulation 150 mM 450 mM NaCl concentration l K = 0 . 36 nm l K = 0 . 43 nm l K = 0 . 66 nm BoundIDP High curvature Low curvature No curvature Conformational entropy decreases Binding affinity increases Fig . 3 Curvature sensing arises from IDP conformational entropy . a Comparison of experimentally measured and simulated change in protein radius as a function of salt concentration .

Nonetheless , electrostatic interactions play an important role because residue – residue repulsion within the IDP chain controls chain rigidity . Next we used Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate whether increases in chain conformational entropy with increasing substrate curvature were suf ﬁ cient to explain our experimental data . Speci ﬁ cally , we calculated the changes in entropy for polymer chains tethered to convex surfaces , where the polymer conformations were determined by a self - avoiding walk ( SAW ) model . Since coverage of the membrane surface by proteins is low in these experiments , it is reasonable to assume that membrane curvature does not change signi ﬁ cantly upon protein binding , as justi ﬁ ed in the Supplementary Discussion section . Based on this assumption , changes in membrane entropy upon protein binding were not incorporated into our simulations . This assumption is further justi ﬁ ed by the observation that the mean vesicle diameter did not shift upon exposure to his - AP180CTD ( Supplementary Fig . 17 ) , as would have been expected had AP180CTD molecules become crowded on membrane surfaces , resulting in high steric pressure 26 . Nonetheless , we cannot rule out the possibility that protein - membrane interactions could locally modify the mem - brane entropy by in ﬂ uencing membrane mechanical properties . Under the assumption that curvature is not altered by protein binding , the number of allowable chain con ﬁ gurations decreases with decreasing substrate curvature as depicted in Fig . 3c . Using Monte Carlo simulations , and deploying a diverse class of SAW models with varying rigidity , we calculated R g for AP180CTD , for which the experimental R g is known ( Supplementary Figs . 18 - 22 and Supplementary Table 2 ) . The optimal SAW model was chosen based on the best agreement between the calculated and measured R g for AP180CTD at 150 mM NaCl concentration ( Supplementary Figs . 12 - 13 ) . This model provided an estimate of the Kuhn length ( l K ) at 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 43 nm , which we used to obtain entropy changes as a function of radius of curvature of the tethering substrate , employing the Hypothetical Scanning Monte Carlo ( HSMC ) method 27 . Assuming a length per amino acid of 0 . 38 nm 28 , 29 , and holding the IDP contour length constant at 216 nm , l K was varied to capture the impact of salt concentration on AP180CTD . The results of these simulations indicate that the entropy for IDP chains bound to 40 nm diameter vesicles relative to chains bound to 200 nm diameter vesicles increases by approximately a factor of 2 as l K increases from 0 . 36 to 0 . 66 nm ( Supplementary Fig . 23 ) . Using a simple Boltzmann formula to relate chain entropy and binding probability ( Eq . 12 ) , these results predict that relative curvature sensitivity over the same range of vesicle diameter should decrease by a similar factor with increasing l K . These values are in reasonable agreement with the experimentally measured curvature sensitivities , as shown in Fig . 3b . Speci ﬁ cally , l k values of 0 . 66 , 0 . 43 , and 0 . 36 nm provide the best approximation of the measured curvature sensitivities under conditions of 10 , 150 , and 450 mM sodium chloride , respectively . Further , the average radius of the chain must increase as l K increases , for ﬁ xed total length of the chain 30 . In agreement with this principle , the results of the Monte Carlo simulation for IDP chains ﬂ uctuating freely in solution provides reasonable agreement with the experimentally determined decrease in AP180CTD hydrodynamic radius with increasing salt concentration , as illustrated in Fig . 3a . This agreement further illustrates that screening of residue – residue electrostatic interac - tions tunes the rigidity and conformational entropy of the polymer - like IDP chain . This agreement is expected whenever IDPs behave as self - avoiding polymers in solution , as shown by comparing simulation results to polymer theory for a SAW 30 , Supplementary Figure 20 . Collectively , the comparison of experiments and simulations shows that curvature sensing by the disordered domain of AP180 arises primarily from the in ﬂ uence of substrate curvature on the conformational entropy of the polymer - like IDP chain ( Fig . 1d ) . Disordered domains sense the curvature of ﬁ lopodia . Having characterized the molecular mechanism of curvature sensing by disordered domains in vitro , we next asked whether disordered domains are capable of sensing membrane curvature in the crowded , heterogeneous environment of the cellular plasma membrane . Here we utilized a recently developed assay 31 to quantify the partitioning of transmembrane fusion proteins between ﬁ lopodia , which have an average diameter of approxi - mately 100 – 200 nm , 32 and the comparatively ﬂ at plasma mem - brane surface ( Fig . 4a ) . The results of this analysis are summarized in Fig . 4b . We ﬁ rst examined the relative partitioning of two control proteins , both consisting of the transmembrane domain of the transferrin receptor fused at its C - terminus to a ﬂ uorescent protein domain , GFP or RFP , such that ﬂ uorescent protein domain was displayed on the outer plasma membrane surface , Fig . 4a , c . We expressed both control proteins simulta - neously in retinal pigmented epithelia ( RPE ) cells and imaged ﬁ lopodial structures at the coverslip surface using two channel confocal ﬂ uorescence microscopy . Since these proteins have nearly identical morphologies , we expected them to partition very similarly between ﬁ lopodia and the plasma membrane . Indeed , when the GFP and RFP images were overlaid , both the plasma membrane and ﬁ lopodia appeared yellow , indicating a similar ratio of ﬁ lopodia to plasma membrane partitioning for both control proteins ( Fig . 4c , center ) . To quantify the partitioning across multiple cells and ﬁ lopodia , we plotted the ﬁ lopodial intensity relative to the local plasma membrane intensity for the GFP control protein versus that of the RFP control protein ( Fig . 4c , right ) . As expected , these data fall along a line with slope equal to one , indicating that the two proteins partition equiva - lently to the ﬁ lopodia ( Fig . 4b ) . Having established these control data , we next fused the disordered domain of AP180 ( AP180CTD ) to the c - terminus of the GFP control protein , resulting in the display of AP180CTD on the outer plasma membrane surface ( Fig . 4d ) . In cells that simultaneously expressed this protein and the RFP control protein , ﬁ lopodia appeared green in overlaid images , suggesting that extracellular display of AP180 increased partitioning to ﬁ lopodia ( Fig . 4d , center ) . Similarly , nearly all ﬁ lopodia had GFP to RFP relative intensity ratios above one ( Fig . 4d , right ) , with an average value of 2 . 34 + 0 . 12 ( Fig . 4b ) . This ﬁ nding is in reasonable agreement with theoretically expected partitioning for membrane surfaces of 100 – 200 nm diameter , approximately two fold ( Supplementary Table 3 ) . If disordered domains drive increased partitioning to the convex outer surfaces of ﬁ lopodia , then displaying the same domain on the concave inner ﬁ lopodial surface should drive a decrease in partitioning . To test this idea , we modi ﬁ ed the GFP control protein to display the disordered domain of Neuro ﬁ lament - M ( NfM ) on either the outer ( C - terminal fusion ) or inner ( N - terminal fusion ) plasma membrane surface ( Fig . 4e , f , respectively ) . Here NfM was chosen because it is a well - characterized intrinsically disordered domain that is known to be highly water soluble 33 and because it has no known cytoplasmic binding partners in non - neuronal cells . Notably , the many endocytic binding partners of AP180CTD 34 would likely alter its physical properties and therefore preclude its use in this experiment . As expected display of NfM on the outer plasma membrane surface drove a partitioning factor greater than one , 1 . 59 + 0 . 05 , while display of the same domain on the inner surface resulted in a value less than one , 0 . 85 + 0 . 03 ( Fig . 4b , e , f ) .

Collectively , these results demonstrate that disordered protein domains can sense membrane curvature within the complex environment of a live cell . Disordered domains enhance sensitivity of structured domains . Having demonstrated that isolated IDPs domains are capable of sensing membrane curvature , we next asked whether disordered domains contribute to the curvature sensing abilities of other endocytic proteins . Speci ﬁ cally , we examined the endocytic adaptor proteins Epsin1 and Amphiphysin1 , both of which consist of N - terminal structure - based curvature sensors followed by bulky , intrinsically disordered C - terminal domains ( Fig . 5 ) . To examine the ability of Epsin1 ’ s C - terminal domain to sense membrane curvature , we expressed and puri ﬁ ed his - EpsinCTD , which consisted of an N - terminal histidine tag followed by resi - dues 144 – 575 of Epsin1 ( Rattus norvegicus ) . We also expressed and puri ﬁ ed the full - length Epsin1 protein , FL - Epsin ( Fig . 5a ) . We estimated the projected area of Epsin1 ’ s IDP domain on the membrane surface at approximately 85 nm 2 , based on our mea - surement of the projected area for his - AP180CTD ( 115 nm 2 ) , assuming that projected area scales approximately linearly with amino acid chain length , as would be the case for a random polymer . We used the tethered vesicle assay to measure the dependence of protein binding on vesicle diameter ( Fig . 5b ) . His - Δ ENTH exhibited no apparent curvature sensitivity as described in Fig . 1e . In contrast , wt - ENTH , his - EpsinCTD , and FL - Epsin all appeared to sense membrane curvature as indicated by the increase in lipid channel ( green ) to protein channel ( red ) ﬂ uorescence intensity ratio with increasing vesicle diameter ( Fig . 5b ) .

The wt - ENTH protein bound six - fold more densely to vesicles of 25 nm diameter in comparison to vesicles of 200 nm diameter . In contrast , his - EpsinCTD achieved a seven - fold increase in binding over the same range of SUV diameter . Interestingly , curvature sensitivity for FL - Epsin achieved a 16 - fold increase in binding , clearly demonstrating that the presence of both the ENTH and disordered domains ampli ﬁ es membrane curvature sensing . We next examined Amphiphysin1 ( Homo sapiens ) , which consists of an N - terminal crescent - shaped BAR domain ( N - BAR ) of approximately 240 amino acids , followed by an intrinsically disordered domain of approximately 380 amino acids , followed by a small , structured SH3 domain of approximately 72 amino acids . The N - BAR domain has been previously demonstrated to sense membrane curvature , likely through a combination of membrane scaffolding by the curved BAR domain and insertion of the N - terminal amphipathic helix 4 , 35 . However , the contribu - tion of the disordered domain to curvature sensing by Amphiphysin1 has not been previously examined . We quanti ﬁ ed curvature sensing by each of Amphiphysin1 ’ s component domains , including N - BAR ( residues 1 – 242 ) , the disordered domain , His - Δ AmphCTD , ( residues 240 – 622 ) , and the full - length protein , FL - Amphiphysin , ( residues 1 – 695 ) ( Fig . 5d ) . To isolate the contribution of the disordered domain , the SH3 domain of Amphiphysin1 ( residues 623 – 695 ) was not included in the his - Δ AmphCTD protein . We estimated the projected area of Amphiphysin1 ’ s IDP domain as 75 nm 2 , scaling from the projected area for his - AP180CTD . In contrast , the N - BAR domain has a projected area of approximately 24 nm 2 per monomer , based on its crystal structure and as assumed elsewhere 36 . N - BAR , his - Δ AmphCTD , and FL - Amphiphysin all appeared to sense membrane curvature as indicated by the increase in lipid channel ( green ) to protein channel ( red ) ﬂ uorescence intensity ratio with increasing vesicle diameter ( Fig . 5e ) .

The N - BAR protein bound 11 - fold more densely to vesicles of 20 nm diameter in comparison to vesicles of 200 nm diameter . By comparison his - Δ AmphCTD achieved a ﬁ ve - fold increase in binding over the same range of vesicle diameter . Strikingly , FL - Amphiphysin exhibited a substantially larger degree of curvature sensitivity in comparison to its constitutive domains , increasing 25 - fold in bound density . This non - additive increase in curvature sensitivity upon inclusion of the disordered domains suggests a synergistic interaction among structured domains and disordered domains . One possible explanation for this effect is the close proximity of the disordered domains in the Amphiphysin1 dimer , which are approximately 6 nm apart , based on the protein structure 4 , similar to the hydrodynamic radii of the disordered domains . As a result of this close spacing , we would expect the disordered domains to sterically and electrostatically exclude one another when the dimer binds to the membrane surface . These IDP – IDP interactions likely contribute to the substantial increase in membrane curvature sensitivity for the full - length Amphiphy - sin1 protein in comparison to either the N - BAR or the disordered domain alone . Although the membrane binding mechanisms for wt - ENTH domains , N - BAR domains , and hexa - histidine tags are each different , we controlled for their varying membrane af ﬁ nities by adjusting their concentration in solution such that each protein reached the same average coverage of the membrane surface . Nonetheless , we cannot rule out the possibility that the membrane chemical potential may vary to some degree among the different mechanisms of protein binding . Discussion Here we have demonstrated that the IDP domains of AP180 , Neuro ﬁ lament - M , Epsin1 , and Amphipysin1 sense membrane curvature at comparable levels to structured curvature sensing domains and are capable of synergistically amplifying the sensi - tivity of these domains . Further , by comparing our experimental results to Monte Carlo simulations , we determined that the cur - vature sensitivity of disordered domains arises primarily from the impact of substrate curvature on their conformational entropy . In contrast to previously identi ﬁ ed curvature sensors that rely on speci ﬁ c structural motifs , our ﬁ ndings illustrate that the lack of a well - de ﬁ ned three dimensional structure can itself provide a potent mechanism for sensing membrane curvature . Notably , the mechanism of curvature sensing identi ﬁ ed here arises from the entropy of the amino acid chain and is therefore unique to disordered proteins . This mechanism is fundamentally distinct from previously identi ﬁ ed mechanisms of membrane bending by both structured and disordered domains , which arise from molecular crowding at membrane surfaces 21 , 37 . In parti - cular , curvature generation by molecular crowding of IDPs is expected only when proteins cover a large fraction of the mem - brane surface 21 . In contrast , the curvature sensing mechanism reported here is only prominent when membrane coverage is low and becomes less potent as membrane coverages increases ( Fig . 1f ) . This entropic mechanism identi ﬁ ed here could apply to any of the substantial group of IDP domains that display random coil - like behavior 38 . Speci ﬁ cally , high proline content 39 and high net charge 40 are common features among endocytic proteins 16 , which have frequently been associated with intrinsic disorder and extended peptide chain conformations . In particular , the FBAR - containing proteins FCHo1 / 2 , which initiate coated - vesicle assembly 41 , and FBP17 42 and CIP4 43 , which participate in vesi - cle departure , have a domain morphology similar to amphiphysin , where large IDP domains are locally clustered by the structured BAR domain scaffold . Furthermore , Hsc70 , the uncoating ATPase which has recently been shown to apply entropic pressure during clathrin coat disassembly 44 , is recruited to clathrin - coated vesicles by auxilin 45 , which also has substantial IDP content . Further , protein constituents of the Coat Protein I and II pathways also contain signi ﬁ cant IDP content 11 , suggesting a possible role in membrane curvature sensing . Interestingly , IBAR domains such as IRSp53 , which have a concave structure and concentrate in ﬁ lopodia 46 , do not contain signi ﬁ cant dis - ordered domains . Such domains would presumably work against the ability of IBAR to sense concave membrane curvature . Finally , disordered domains are ubiquitous among transmembrane pro - teins 47 , such as G protein - coupled receptors 48 and the compo - nents of highly curved synaptic vesicles 49 , suggesting that disordered domains may help transmembrane proteins sense membrane curvature , in addition to recent reports of curvature sensing by speci ﬁ c transmembrane protein structural features 31 , 50 , 51 . Entropically driven curvature sensing by disordered domains fundamentally departs from the deterministic structure - function paradigm that presently dominates our understanding of mem - brane curvature sensing . Speci ﬁ cally , the ﬁ ndings of this work suggest that disordered domains play important roles by colla - borating with structured domains to detect curved membrane sites during diverse biological processes .

All of these chimeric proteins contained the intracellular and transmembrane domains of transferrin receptor ( TfR - Δ ecto , human , amino acids 1 - 88 ; AAA61153 ) and GFP ( EGFP ; AAB02574 ) . For this present work , a A206K mutation was added to GFP to prevent dimerization of GFP - containing proteins 53 . The mutation was performed using site - directed mutagenesis ( primers in Supplementary Table 4 ) . The control RFP construct was synthesized by modifying the TfR - Δ ecto - GFP described above , where GFP was replaced where RFP ( Accession number ABN59525 ) . AgeI and NotI restriction enzymes were used to excise GFP from the pEGFP - N1 vector containing TfR - Δ ecto - GFP ( primers in Supplementary Table 4 ) .

GST - containing fusion proteins were then puri ﬁ ed by incubation with glutathione agarose beads ( Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ) . Bound proteins were thoroughly washed with buffer consisting of 25 mM HEPES , 150 mM NaCl , 10 mM β - mercaptoethanol , and 1 mM EDTA ( pH 7 . 4 ) . All proteins , with the exception of Amphiphysin - FL , were then cleaved from the beads with thrombin ( GE Healthcare Life Sciences ) overnight at 15°C . Thrombin was subsequently removed using p - aminobenzamidine - agarose ( Sigma - Aldrich ) for 30 min at 4°C . Amphiphysin - FL was cleaved from agarose beads using the protease HRV - 3C ( Thermo Scienti ﬁ c Pierce ) . The GST - containing HRV - 3C was removed using glutathione resin . The C - terminal domain of AP180 ( his - AP180CTD ) was expressed as a GST fusion protein for increased stability during expression , and the GST was subsequently removed by thrombin cleavage . BL21 transformed with the expression construct were grown in 2X YT media at 30°C , induced with 1mM IPTG at an OD600 of 0 . 8 , and grown for an additional 7 h at 30 °C . Cell pellets from a 2L culture were resuspended in 100ml of 0 . 5M Tris pH 8 . 0 , 5 mM EDTA , 5 % glycerol , 5mM TCEP , and 2 Roche protease inhibitor cocktail pellets ( Roche # 5056489001 ) ( lysis buffer ) by sonication on ice ( 4× 2000 joules ) , followed by the addition of Triton X - 100 to 1 % . All subsequent steps were carried out at 4°C . The lysate was clari ﬁ ed by ultracentrifugation at 186 , 010 × g for 30 min and the supernatant was applied to 15 ml of glutathione Sepharose ( GE Healthcare # 17 - 0756 - 05 ) , washed with 10 column volumes of lysis buffer , and eluted with 15 mM glutathione in lysis buffer . The buffer was exchanged with 50mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 10 mM CaCl 2 ( thrombin digestion buffer ) in a Zeba Desalting Column ( Thermo Scienti ﬁ c # 89891 ) , and the GST tag was cleaved with the Thrombin CleanCleave kit ( Sigma - Aldrich # RECOMT - 1KT ) for 14h at 4°C in 50 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 and 10 mM CaCl 2 with rocking , followed by the addition of 15mM EGTA , 5mM EDTA , 150 mM NaCl , and 5mM TCEP . The GST was removed by running the digestion products through a glutathione Sepharose column . The puri ﬁ ed protein was concentrated to 3 . 6mg ml − 1 in an Amicon Ultra - 15 centrifugal ﬁ lter ( MilliporeSigma # UFC903024 ) , and stored as liquid nitrogen pellets at − 80°C . Hexa - histidine tagged ENTH ( his - Δ ENTH ) was expressed in BL21 cells following overnight induction with 1mM IPTG at 18 °C . Bacterial lysate was incubated in Ni - NTA agarose beads ( Qiagen ) with buffer consisting of 25 mM HEPES , 150 mM NaCl , and 5mM β - mercaptoethanol ( pH 7 . 4 ) . After thorough washing , his - Δ ENTH was eluted from the resin by incorporating imidazole into the buffer . The imidazole concentration was gradually increased in a step - wise manner up to a ﬁ nal concentration of 200mM . The eluted protein was then concentrated and dialyzed against the original incubation buffer at 4°C overnight . After puri ﬁ cation , all proteins were stored at − 80 °C . Protein labeling . ATTO - NHS dyes were dissolved in DMSO at a concentration of 10mM and stored at − 80°C . Labelling of lysine residues was performed with protein concentrations ranging from 20 to 100 μ M in buffer consisting of 25 mM HEPES , 150 mM NaCl , and 5 mM TCEP ( pH 7 . 4 ) . Dye was added to the protein in 2 – 3× stoichiometric excess and allowed to react for 1 h on ice , resulting in labelling ratios ranging from 0 . 5 : 1 to 1 . 5 : 1 dye : protein . The amount of DMSO in the labelling reaction mixture never exceeded 1 % v / v . Unconjugated dye was separated from labeled protein using size exclusion chromatography with Sephadex G - 25 ( GE Healthcare Life Sciences ) for wt - ENTH , his - Δ ENTH , and BAR . For all other proteins , Centri - Spin size exclusion columns ( Princeton Separations ) were used . Protein and dye concentrations were monitored using UV – Vis spectroscopy . Labelled proteins were stored at − 80 °C . GFP puri ﬁ cation and PEG conjugation . GFP and PEG40K - GFP were prepared as previously described 53 . Brie ﬂ y , non - dimerizable hexa - his - tagged EGFP A206K ( his - GFP ; AAB02574 ) was made suitable for maleimide - PEG conjugation by mutating an exposed glycine residue in the N - terminal linker region to a cysteine . After expression , bacterial lysates were incubated with Ni - NTA agarose in 20 mM HEPES , 150 mM NaCl ( pH = 7 . 4 ) buffer , thoroughly washed , and eluted using 200 mM imidazole buffer . His - GFP was then dialyzed to remove imidazole . For PEG conjugation , his - GFP was incubated with an excess of maleimide - PEG40K at 4 °C overnight in 20mM phosphate , 150mM NaCl , 1mM TCEP ( pH = 7 . 4 ) buffer . The reaction mixture was then incubated in Ni - NTA resin , washed , and eluted to remove unreacted PEG . The eluted protein was then subjected to size exclusion chromatography using a Sepharose G75 column to remove unreacted protein . Preparation of small unilamellar vesicles . Lipid aliquots ( stored at − 80°C ) were brought to room temperature and combined in appropriate quantities ( see below * ) to achieve the desired stoichiometric ratios . Once combined , solvent was evapo - rated using a gentle nitrogen stream . The resulting lipid ﬁ lm was further dried under vacuum overnight . The lipid ﬁ lm was then hydrated in appropriate buffer ( see below * * ) at a ﬁ nal concentration of 200 μ M total lipid , thoroughly mixed , and held at room temperature for 15 min while lipids were allowed to hydrate . Small unilamellar vesicles ( SUVs ) were made using three different methods : probe tip sonication ( Branson Ultrasonics ) , extrusion through a 30nm polycarbonate membrane ( Whatman plc ) , and extrusion through a 200 nm polycarbonate membrane ( Whatman plc ) . The three preparations resulted in SUV populations with average diameters of 49 + 5nm , 67 + 4 nm , and 147 + 7 nm , respectively , as determined by dynamic light scattering . * The molar composition of SUVs used for histidine tagged proteins was as follows : 80 % DOPC , 16 % DGS NTA , 2 % DP - EG10 - biotin , 2 % OG - DHPE . For SUVs used in wt - ENTH and Epsin - FL binding , the molar composition was 88 . 5 % DOPC , 7 . 5 % PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 , 2 % DP - EG10 - biotin , 2 % OG - DHPE . For N - BAR and Amphiphysin - FL binding , the SUV molar composition used was 76 % DOPC , 15 % DOPS , 5 % PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 , 2 % DP - EG10 - biotin , 2 % OG - DHPE . * * For histidine tagged proteins , SUVs were made in a buffer consisting of 25 mM HEPES and 150 mM NaCl ( pH 7 . 4 ) . For all other proteins , SUVs were made in a buffer consisting of 25mM HEPES , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 5 mM EDTA , and 0 . 5 mM EGTA ( pH 7 . 4 ) . Tethering of lipid vesicles and protein binding . SUVs were tethered as pre - viously described with slight modi ﬁ cation 26 . Brie ﬂ y , glass cover slips were passi - vated with a layer of biotinylated PLL - PEG , 5 kDa PEG . SUVs doped with 2mol % DP - EG10 - biotin were then tethered to the passivated surface using NeutrAvidin . PLL - PEG was synthesized by combining amine reactive PEG and PEG - biotin in molar ratios of 98 % and 2 % , respectively . This PEG mixture was added to a 20 mg / mL mixture of PLL in 50 mM sodium tetraborate ( pH 8 . 5 ) such that the molar ratio of lysine subunits to PEG was 5 : 1 . The mixture was continuously stirred at room temperature for 6h then buffer exchanged into 25 mM HEPES , 150 mM NaCl ( pH 7 . 4 ) using Centri - Spin size exclusion columns ( Princeton Separations ) . Imaging wells consisted 5mm diameter holes in 0 . 8mm thick silicone gaskets ( Grace Bio - Labs ) . Gaskets were placed directly on top of no . 1 . 5 glass cover slips ( VWR International ) , creating a temporary water - proof seal . Prior to well assembly , gaskets and cover slips were cleaned in 2 % v / v Hellmanex III ( Hellma Analytics ) solution , rinsed thoroughly with water , and dried under a nitrogen stream . To each dry imaging well , 20µL of PLL - PEG was added . After 20min of incubation , wells were serially rinsed with 25mM HEPES , 150 mM NaCl ( pH 7 . 4 ) using gentle pipetting until a 15 , 000 - fold dilution was achieved . Next , 4µg of NeutrAvidin dissolved in 25mM HEPES , 150mM NaCl ( pH 7 . 4 ) was added to each sample well and allowed to incubate for 10 min . Wells were then rinsed with the appropriate buffer to remove excess NeutrAvidin . Sonicated , 30nm - extruded , and 200 nm - extruded SUVs were then each independently added ( see below * ) to sample wells at lipid concentrations of 0 . 5 , 1 , and 5µM , respectively , and allowed to incubate for 10min . Excess SUVs were then rinsed from the well using the appropriate buffer . Finally , speci ﬁ c proteins at desired concentrations in appropriate buffers — with the addition of 5mM TCEP — were added to wells and allowed to incubate for at least 30 min before imaging . All proteins were labeled with ATTO - 594 . During all rinsing and reagent addition steps , proper precaution was taken to ensure that changes in sample volume within the imaging wells were minimized .

The resulting data from the three experiments was then consolidated to cover a broad range of vesicle diameter . Cell culture and transfection . Human RPE cells ( ARPE - 19 ) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection . Cells were grown in 1 : 1 F12 : DMEM supple - mented with 10 % FBS , 20 mM HEPES , Pen / Strep / L - glutamine ( 100 units / ml , 100 μ g ml − 1 , 300 μ gml − 1 respectively ) and incubated at 37°C with 5 % CO 2 . Cells were seeded onto acid washed coverslips at a density of 5× 10 4 cells per coverslip for 24 h before transfection with 1µg of plasmid DNA in 3 µL of Fugene transfection reagent ( Promega , Madison , WI , USA ) . Cells were imaged 20 h after transfection . Fluorescence microscopy . A spinning disc confocal microscope ( Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 with Yokagawa CSU - X1M ) was used to visualize tethered SUVs and bound proteins . For excitation , lasers with wavelengths of 488 and 561 nm were used . Emission ﬁ lters were centered at 525 nm with 50nm width and 629 nm with a 62 nm width . A triple pass dichroic mirror was used : 405 / 488 / 561 nm . A Plan - Apochromat 100× , 1 . 4 numerical aperture oil immersion objective was used . Tethered SUVs and bound proteins were imaged on a cooled ( − 70°C ) EMCCD iXon3 897 camera ( Andor Technology ; Belfast , UK ) . Image processing for tethered vesicles . Image stacks perpendicular to the sample plane ( 16 slices , 0 . 1 µm steps ) of lipid and protein ﬂ uorescence were acquired using confocal microscopy . Images were 513 × 513 pixels ( 1 pixel = 133 . 3 nm ) in size . In all images , the stacks were cropped to the center 171× 171 pixels ( center 1 / 9th ) to ensure uniform focus and the frame with the largest mean brightness was selected as the best focus image for analysis . Since all of the SUVs of interest ( 20 – 250nM diameter ) appeared as diffraction - limited puncta , publically - available particle detection software ( cmeAnalysis ) was used to obtain ﬂ uorescence amplitudes 54 . Individual vesicles were detected by ﬁ tting two - dimensional Gaus - sian pro ﬁ les to each puncta in the lipid ﬂ uorescence channel . The standard deviation of the Gaussian was determined from the point spread function of our microscope . If a detected punctum had an amplitude signi ﬁ cantly above its local ﬂ uorescence background , it was included in the analysis . The program then used an algorithm to ﬁ nd puncta in the ﬂ uorescent protein channel that were spatially colocalized with the centroids of the puncta in the ﬂ uorescent lipid channel . The dimension of this search region was three times the standard deviation of the Gaussian ﬁ t to the point spread function . In the event that a protein punctum could not be found in a search region , protein ﬂ uorescence in that region was ﬁ t with a two - dimensional Gaussian with a centroid corresponding that of the lipid punc - tum . This step in the analysis takes into account SUVs that did not have any bound protein . To further ensure that all reported lipid puncta included in the analysis were above the noise threshold of our images , we only accepted puncta in the lipid channel that persisted in the same location throughout three consecutive frames in the image stack . Calibration of vesicle size and protein number . SUV diameter was estimated on the basis of ﬂ uorescence in the lipid channel confocal images , using a previously reported protocol 5 . Brie ﬂ y , we computed a scaling factor which centered the peak of the vesicle brightness distribution , prior to protein addition , to the average vesicle diameter obtained from dynamic light scattering . The addition of proteins did not affect the vesicle brightness distribution over the concentration ranges observed . The number of bound proteins to each vesicle was estimated using single - molecule imaging to determine the brightness of a single ATTO - 594 labelled protein . 50 pM of labelled protein was added to an imaging well consisting of freshly clean bare glass . After acquiring an image z - stack , the image with the brightest average pixel value was used as the best focus frame for analysis . We used cmeAnalysis to determine the brightness distribution of adsorbed single proteins which appeared as diffraction - limited puncta on the glass cover slip surface ( Supplementary Fig . 9a - b ) . To ensure the presence of single molecules , the brightness distribution of puncta that underwent single - step photobleaching was also measured ( Supplementary Fig . 9c ) . This distribution yielded a similar peak value , indicating agreement with the overall puncta brightness distribution . This peak value was then used to estimate the number of proteins bound to a given vesicle . Calibration values for ATT0594 - labeled his - ENTH and his - AP180CTD were very similar , indicating that the protein single - molecule intensity was not a function of protein type . Typical experiments measuring SUV diameter and pro - tein content generated in excess of 1000 data points per condition . To display these relationships , a moving average was applied to each data set as demonstrated in Supplementary Figures 5 - 8 . Data was binned according to SUV diameter in increments of 5 + 2 . 5nm for diameters ranging from 20 to 250 nm . Within each bin , the mean number of membrane - bound proteins was reported along with its standard error ( 95 % con ﬁ dence ) . This binned dataset was then used to calculate protein coverage and normalized coverage values . Coverage of 200 nm diameter SUVs was calculated as the average coverage from 190 to 210 nm . All other cov - erage values were normalized to this value , yielding the normalized coverage . Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy . Imaging wells were coated with sup - ported lipid bilayers consisting of DOPC ( 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocho - line ) to block adsorption of protein from solution onto the coverslip surface . SUVs consisting of 100 % DOPC were prepared by sonication in 25mM HEPES , 150 mM NaCl ( pH 7 . 4 ) and added to the imaging wells at a lipid concentration of 500 µM . After 10 min of incubation at room temperature , excess vesicles were thoroughly rinsed from the imaging well . Protein labelled with ATTO - 488 dye was then added to the well at concentrations ranging from 0 . 5 to 2 . 0 nM . FCS measurements in solution , several micrometers above the lipid passivation layer were acquired using a custom - built time - correlated single - photon counting confocal microscope that has been described previously 21 . FCS autocorrelation curves were collected for 200 s using Becker and Hickl data acquisition software . Six FCS curves were obtained for all AP180CTD containing samples , while three curves were obtained for all other proteins . Each curve was ﬁ t with the standard 2D autocorrelation function : G t ð Þ¼ 1 þ 1 þ Ae (cid:3) t = τ c (cid:1) (cid:3) 1 N p ! 1 1 þ t τ D (cid:1) (cid:3) α 0 B @ 1 CA ð 3 Þ where N p corresponds to the average number of particles diffusing through the confocal volume and τ D is the particle diffusion time . To improve the overall quality of our ﬁ ts , we included an anomalous diffusion coef ﬁ cient ( α ) and triple - state contribution terms A and τ c . Values for α varied between 0 . 9 and 1 . 0 , minimally impacting the regressed values of τ D . Triplet - state variables A and τ c were held constant at 0 . 05 and 5 μ s 55 , respectively , and had very little effect on ﬁ tting the longer time diffusion processes of interest . Image analysis for live cell experiment . Image stacks taken at ﬁ xed distances perpendicular to the membrane plane ( 18 slices , 0 . 1µm steps ) were acquired using confocal microscopy . Images were 513 × 513 pixels ( 1 pixel = 133 . 3 nm ) in size and the frame with the largest mean brightness was selected as the best focus image for analysis . Using ImageJ analysis software , an average ﬂ uorescence intensity on the area in the bulk cell membrane was determined for both GFP and RFP . For ﬁ lopodia , ﬂ uorescence brightness was determined via the average maximum value of three perpendicular line scans . Background ﬂ uorescence was then subtracted from both membrane and ﬁ lopodia intensities . On average , 100 ﬁ lopodia from 25 cells were analyzed for each condition . Generation of polymer conformations . SAW models on a simple cubic lattice , with varied SAW step lengths and exclusions around an occupied site were used to model the IDP con ﬁ gurations . Such models serve as good simplistic descriptions of well - solvated polymers . They are especially amenable to the computation of entropy changes owing to their theoretical simplicity , and the ability to sample a large number of polymer conformations using relatively short Monte Carlo simulation simulations . A given step of a SAW on a 3D cubic lattice can be denoted as ( PQR ) , where each of P , Q , and R can assume integer values . The allowed combinations are dictated by the choice of the SAW model deployed . In the simplest case of walks to adjacent ( ﬁ rst nearest neighbor ) sites can be denoted as the ( 001 ) models , which corresponds to allowed steps of “ a ” in any of the three coordinate directions , where “ a ” is the lattice constant . Further , the steric con - straints between monomers can be approximated by excluding its neighbor sites from occupancy , up until the Xth nearest neighbor sites . The various SAW walks simulated are denoted thus as “ nbrPQRexclX ” ( neighbor - PQR - excluded - X ) . The model “ nbr112excl2 ” accordingly corresponds to 24 walk directions determined by the allowed combinations , as explained in the previous example . Moreover , for each lattice site occupied by a polymer bead , the neighboring lattice sites up to the second nearest neighbor ( six ﬁ rst nearest neighbor sites + 12 s nearest neighbor sites ) are excluded from occupancy . The choice of P , Q , R , and X determines the ﬂ exibility of the polymer chain . The set of SAW models used in the study are detailed in Supplementary Table 2 . For each SAW model , the length of a step is 0 . 38 nm , the separation between successive C α atoms in the protein backbone . For estimation of structural properties such as the radius of gyration ( R g ) , the SAW polymers were allowed to move freely on the cubic lattice , while they were anchored onto the membrane substrate through a terminal bead for the calcula - tions of entropy . The membrane substrate was modeled by simply excluding the relevant lattice sites from occupancy . Computation of chain entropy . The absolute entropy ( S ) from polymer chain conformations is calculated using the HSMC method developed by Meirovitch et al . 27 Brie ﬂ y , in the HSMC method , the reconstruction probability of a polymer chain conformation i ( Pi HSMC ) is obtained from the construction probabilities ( p j ) of each bond direction ( ν j ) P HSMC i ¼ Y N j ¼ 1 p j ν j j ν j (cid:3) 1 ð Þ ; ¼ ; ν 1 (cid:1) (cid:3) ð 4 Þ where N is the number of bonds in the polymer ( ( N + 1 ) is the number of beads ) . The p j are measured using MC simulation of the entire future part of the chain ( ν j , ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 018 - 06532 - 3 12 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2018 ) 9 : 4152 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 018 - 06532 - 3 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications … , ν N ) with the frozen past ( ν ( j - 1 ) , … , ν 1 ) ; ν j representing a walk direction for the jth bond , which can range across the allowed walk directions for the given SAW model . If n MC is the number of MC steps deployed between the constructions of bonds ( j − 1 ) and j , and n j ν ( k ) denotes the number of these steps in which a possible next bond direction ν j ( k ) is observed , then : p j ν j ð k Þj ν j (cid:3) 1 ð Þ ; ¼ ; ν 1 (cid:1) (cid:3) ¼ n ν k ð Þ j n MC ð 5 Þ Following the n MC steps , the direction of the bond j , ν j is chosen randomly , and the observed probability p j is stored for the calculation of the reconstruction probability P i HSMC . For accurate estimation of p j , n MC for a given construction step is scaled with the length of the future chain segment . In our simulations , given the variety of SAW models used which differ in the allowed number of walk directions , n MC ( j ) is scaled as (cid:1) n : n nbr : n (cid:3) j þ 1 ð Þ ð Þ , where (cid:1) n = 1000 and n nbr is the number of allowed walk directions for the SAW model deployed . Between the n MC steps corresponding to bonds j and ( j + 1 ) , the segment ( ν j + 1 , … , ν n ) is reinitialized to an allowed extended conformation , and equilibrated for n ′ : n nbr : n (cid:3) j þ 1 ð Þ (cid:4) (cid:5) , steps where n ′ = 100 . The rigorous upper bound to the entropy ( in units of k B , the Boltzmann constant ) can be obtained from P i HSMC using : S U ¼ (cid:3) X i 1 Z SAW ln P HMSC i ð 6 Þ where Z SAW is the number of all possible SAWs . For a large number of sampled conformations ( N obs ) , and since all the SAWs have identical statistical weight , S U can be approximated by : S U (cid:4) 1 N obs X i ln P HSMC i ð 7 Þ In addition , the lower bound to the entropy can be obtained as : S L ¼ (cid:3) X i P HSMC i ln P HSMC i ð 8 Þ ¼ (cid:3) P i 1 Z SAW P HSMC i ln P HSMC i (cid:6) (cid:7) P i 1 Z SAW P HSMC i ð 9 Þ (cid:4) (cid:3) P i 1 N obs P HSMC i ln P HSMC i (cid:6) (cid:7) P i 1 N obs P HSMC i ð 10 Þ The resultant absolute entropy ( S ) is calculated as the mean of S U and S L . Monte Carlo simulations . The structural properties for each SAW model and each length of polymer chain considered ( R g ) were calculated using 64 Monte Carlo simulation trajectories , with random number generator ( Mersenne Twister ) initi - alized using different seed values . Each of these simulations involved 10 7 MC steps ( a MC step is de ﬁ ned as a sequence of N local moves , chosen at random ) divided over 10 blocks . The absolute entropies were calculated using either 96 or 120 generated reconstruction probabilities corresponding to different polymer con - formations . A different value of seed for random number generator was used for each case . Conversion of entropy to relative curvature sensitivity . The Boltzmann dis - tribution ( Eq . 11 ) states that partitioning between bound and unbound proteins on vesicle surface ( K bind ) is equal to the exponent of the free energy difference between the free and bound protein ( Δ G bind ) divided by k B T . If curvature sensing is driven solely by entropy , then the enthalpy of binding ( Δ H bind ) would be constant among all vesicle diameters . Therefore , the relative partitioning between two vesicles with different diameters ( K bind , 1 / K bind , 2 ) can be calculated as shown in Eq . 12 . The difference in binding entropy ( Δ S bind ) between the two vesicles is equal to the entropy change resulting from curvature ( ΔΔ S curvature ) . Therefore , using 200nm diameter SUVs as a reference , Eq . 14 was used to calculate the relative partitioning increase for simulated IDPs on vesicles in the 40 to 200 nm diameter range .
