In yeast cells , this involves the invagination of a tubular structure on the membrane and the formation of endocytic vesicles . Bin / Amphiphysin / Rvs ( BAR ) proteins holding a crescent - shape are generally assumed to be the active player to squeeze the tubular structure and pinch oﬀ the vesicle by forming a scaﬀold on the side of the tubular membrane . Here we use the extended Helfrich model to theoretically investigate how BAR proteins help drive the formation of vesicles via generating anisotropic curvatures . Our results show that , within the classical Helfrich model , increasing the spontaneous curvature at the side of a tubular membrane is unable to reduce the tube radius to a critical size to induce membrane ﬁssion . However , membranes coated with proteins that generate anisotropic curvatures are prone to experience an hourglass - shaped necking or a tube - shaped necking process , an important step leading to membrane ﬁssion and vesicle formation . In addition , our study shows that depending on the type of anisotropic curvatures generated by a protein , the force to maintain the protein coated membrane at a tubular shape exhibits qualitatively diﬀerent relationship with the spontaneous curvature . This result provides an experimental guidance to determine the type of anisotropic curvatures of a protein . Endocytosis is involved in many cellular processes , in - cluding nutrient uptake , regulated recycling of plasma membrane components , and neural signaling [ 1 ] . This process is achieved through a formation of transient , highly curved membrane conﬁgurations such as tubules or vesicles , which have the targeted molecules wrapped inside [ 2 ] . During endocytosis in yeast cells , a small patch of the plasma membrane is ﬁrst deformed into a shallow invagination , which is subsequently elongated into a deep one , followed by a constriction of its neck until a cargo - carrying vesicle is formed and pinched oﬀ [ 3 ] . These membrane - shaping events are generally mediated by a plethora types of proteins bound to the membrane [ 4 – 7 ] . The presence of diﬀerent types of proteins on the mem - brane gives rise to changes in mechanical properties of the membrane , such as bending rigidity [ 8 ] and mem - brane curvature [ 9 ] . Clathrin proteins assemble into a lattice with a mixture of pentagons and hexagons which scaﬀold the ﬂat membrane into a spherical shape [ 10 – 13 ] . The GTPase dynamin proteins form a helical band at the neck of the endocytic pit . It is generally thought that the constriction of the band upon GTP hydrolysis drives vesicle scission . Another active participant to facilitate vesicle scission is the Bin / amphiphysin / Rvs ( BAR ) do - main proteins that are found to be bound at the side of the endocytic pit and assemble into a cylindrical scaﬀold . The crescent - shaped BAR proteins are expected to bend the membrane into diﬀerent curvatures in parallel with and in perpendicular with their orientations [ 3 , 14 – 16 ] . Such a mechanical feature , enhanced by the enrichment of BAR proteins on the membrane , is able to induce tubu - lation [ 17 – 19 ] . The role of BAR proteins as a facilitator for vesicle scission has been challenged by Walani et al . who proposed that the BAR proteins actually help sta - bilize the tubular endocytic pit and it is the depolymer - ization of BAR proteins that leads to the scission of the tubular pit through a snap - through transition induced by high membrane tension [ 20 ] . The physical mechanisms behind vesiculation during endocytosis are actively studied both in the context of cell biology and biophysics . Rapid developments in imag - ing technologies such as electron microscopy and ﬂuo - rescence microscopy have demonstrated the shapes of endocytic pit at diﬀerent stages of endocytosis [ 21 – 23 ] . Experiments have conﬁrmed that vesicle formation can arise from the conical shape of lipid molecules [ 24 , 25 ] , membrane tension induced by external forces [ 26 – 28 ] , as well as spontaneous curvature generated by membrane - bound proteins [ 29 – 32 ] . Theoretical modeling was ex - ploited to interpret experimental observations in a mech - anistic context , oﬀering valuable insights into the under - lying mechanical principles of membrane budding phe - nomena [ 20 , 33 – 37 ] . Most of these works focus on the explanation of how a ﬂat membrane is deformed into ei - ther a tubular pit via external forces or a spherical vesicle via clathrin assembly . The very last step of vesicle scis - sion has been studied only in a limited number of works . By constructing a quantitative model , Liu et al . [ 34 ] sug - a r X i v : 2 2 11 . 09490v1 [ c ond - m a t . s o f t ] 1 7 N ov 2022 2 gested that the line tension at the interface between dif - ferent lipid domains on the invaginating membrane is suf - ﬁcient for a successful vesicle scission during endocytosis . However , experimental evidence for lipid phase separa - tion on the endocytic pit is still lacking . In the classical Helfrich model of membrane , the eﬀect of curvature generation by proteins on the membrane is embedded in a parameter so called spontaneous curva - ture . In order to reduce the energetic cost for bending , membrane tends to deform in such a way that the mean curvature of the membrane equals to the spontaneous curvature . However , this description of curvature gener - ation cannot capture the eﬀect of anisotropic proteins , such as BAR proteins , which tend to bend the mem - brane independently into diﬀerent curvatures in diﬀerent tangential directions . Whether the anisotropic curvature generated by BAR - proteins at the side of a tubular mem - brane is able to induce vesicle scission remains unclear . In this paper , using the extended - Helfrich model de - veloped to account for the anisotropic spontaneous cur - vatures generated by anisotropic proteins [ 38 – 41 ] , we investigate how a tubular membrane is deformed by anisotropic proteins bound to the side of the membrane . It is found that within the classical Helfrich model of membrane , increasing the spontaneous curvature cannot lead to membrane ﬁssion . Anisotropic spontaneous cur - vatures are necessary to narrow the membrane into a tubular neck or an hourglass neck . We also suggest an ex - perimental method to distinguish the type of anisotropic spontaneous curvatures generated by a protein by com - paring the force to maintain the membrane at a tubular shape in the presence and absence of the protein coat . We consider the deformation of a tubular invagination in the late stage of endocytosis in yeast cells when BAR proteins are present at the side of the tube , as shown in Fig . 1 ( a ) and ( b ) . The invagination has been pulled into a tubular shape by actin polymerization forces f against the high turgor pressure p inside of the cell . The mem - brane tension σ is assumed to be small due to the pres - ence of eisosomes which serve as a membrane reservoir . The curvature generated by the clathrin coat at the tip of the invagination is described by the Helfrich model . The anisotropic curvature generated by the BAR proteins at the side of the invagination is described by the extended - Helfrich model with a bending energy density per unit area given by [ 41 ] f b = κ 2 ( c 1 − c 10 ) 2 + κ 2 ( c 2 − c 20 ) 2 + κ 12 ( c 1 − c 10 ) ( c 2 − c 20 ) , where κ denotes the bending rigidity , c 1 and c 2 repre - sent the two principal curvatures of the membrane ( see Fig . 1 ( c ) ) , and c 10 and c 20 denote the preferred curvature imposed by the BAR proteins in the longitudinal direc - tion and in the circumferential direction , respectively . The coupling constant κ 12 determines the type of cur - vature generated by proteins , which in general deviates Figure 1 . ( a ) Electron micrograph of an endocytic invagi - nation in yeast cells when BAR proteins are present . The graph is adapted from Ref . [ 1 ] . ( b ) Schematic illustration of the proteins involved in endocytosis . The BAR proteins Rvs ( red ) are bound to the side of the membrane and expected to generate anisotropic curvatures to facilitate membrane ﬁs - sion . ( c ) A schematic picture of the membrane morphology depicts r neck , c 1 , and c 2 . from κ , corresponding to an anisotropic curvature model . When κ 12 = κ , it reduces to the classical Helfrich model . In order to derive shape equations which govern the morphology of the membrane surface at the endocytosis site , Euler - Lagrange variational methods were performed with respect to the total free energy of the membrane . As a result , the shape equations can be computed via min - imizing the total free energy functional under the con - straints . The details of the model and the equations are presented in the Supplementary Information . We numer - ically solve these shape equations in Matlab using the ’bvp4c’ solver . As the eﬀect of the anisotropic proteins bound to the side of the endocytic invagination is described by the spontaneous curvature c 20 in the circumferential direction , we deliberately vary c 20 so as to study how the membrane morphology changes accordingly . The membrane mor - phology is characterized by the mean neck radius (cid:104) r neck (cid:105) and the mean of two principal curvatures (cid:104) c 1 (cid:105) and (cid:104) c 2 (cid:105) over the anisotropic protein coated area . Vesiculation is indicated by reducing the narrowest neck radius below a critical value of 5nm . For the case of the classical Helfrich model ( κ 12 = κ ) , varying c 20 is equivalent to tuning the spontaneous cur - vature of the model . It is shown that the average neck radius (cid:104) r neck (cid:105) is a non - monotonic function of c 2 0 with a minimum of about 14 nm , far from the critical value for vesiculation to occur ( 5 nm ) . The average longitudinal curvature (cid:104) c 1 (cid:105) increases with c 20 and changes its sign when c 20 crosses 0 ( Fig . 2 ( b ) ) , while the average circumferential curvature (cid:104) c 2 (cid:105) reaches a peak value at an intermediate 3 value of c 20 .

The average is taken over the protein - coated area at the side of the membrane . The three curves in ( a - c ) correspond to diﬀerent coating areas . ( d ) Proﬁle views of membrane morphologies for positive ( dotted line ) , negative ( dashed line ) , and zero ( solid line ) spontaneous curvature c 20 . zero spontaneous curvatures c 20 are depicted in Fig . 2 ( d ) , where the protein - coated area of positive / negative spon - taneous curvatures shows a wider radius than that of zero spontaneous curvature . These results suggest that in - creasing the spontaneous curvature in the Helfrich model is unable to produce vesiculation . We next investigate whether the extended - Helfrich model is able to produce vesiculation . As a ﬁrst at - tempt , we consider κ 12 = 0 . If the area of the anisotropic protein - coated membrane is small , the average neck ra - dius (cid:104) r neck (cid:105) and the average circumferential curvature (cid:104) c 2 (cid:105) are almost independent of c 20 ( see the black curves in Fig . 3 ( a ) and ( c ) ) , while the average longitudinal cur - vature (cid:104) c 1 (cid:105) increases with c 20 in a considerable way ( see the black curve in Fig . 3 ( b ) ) . In contrast , for larger coat - ing area , (cid:104) r neck (cid:105) is narrowed down with the increase of c 20 and the longitudinal curvature (cid:104) c 1 (cid:105) drops to a value that is close to zero ( see blue and red curves in Fig . 3 ( a ) and ( b ) ) , corresponding to a membrane morphology clas - siﬁed as tubular neck , as depicted by the dotted proﬁle in Fig . 3 ( d ) . These results suggest that the extended - Helfrich model κ 12 = 0 is able to produce vesiculation if the coating area is large enough . Subsequently , we consider the model κ 12 = 2 κ . As the coating area exceeds a certain value , the average neck radius (cid:104) r neck (cid:105) decreases monotonically with the sponta - neous curvature c 20 . In particular , the minimum neck radius r neck , min drops to a few nanometers , indicating the occurrence of vesiculation ( see the blue and the red curves in the inset of Fig . 4 ( a ) ) .

( d ) Proﬁle views of membrane morphologies for positive ( dotted line ) , negative ( dashed line ) , and zero ( solid line ) spontaneous curvature c 20 . In order to systematically investigate how membrane morphology depends on the coupling constant κ 12 , we 4 construct a κ 12 - c 20 phase diagram ( Fig . 5 ) summarizing the possible membrane morphologies . For negative and small positive values of κ 12 , increasing the spontaneous curvature c 20 to a critical value leads to vesiculation with a tube - shaped neck ( see the black curve encompassing the white region in the top left corner of Fig . 5 ) . For large positive values of κ 12 , vesiculation with an hourglass - shaped neck can occur if the spontaneous curvature c 20 is beyond a critical value ( see the black curve encompassing the white region in the top right corner of Fig . 5 ) . There exists an intermediate range of κ 12 in which vesiculation does not occur even for very large c 20 . Figure 5 . A two - dimensional phase diagram on the ( c 20 – κ 12 ) plane characterizes the interrelated eﬀects of the spontaneous curvature c 20 and the coupling constant κ 12 on the forma - tion of vesicles . The colored region represents the membrane shapes that have not undergone vesiculation with a color code demonstrating the force magnitude to maintain the membrane at a tubular shape . The white regions represents the mem - brane shapes that have the necking radius smaller than a critical value of 5 nm , by which a vesiculation is regarded to occur . The top left corner denotes a tube - shaped necking and the top right corner denotes an hourglass - shaped necking . The coating area A coat is 1200 nm 2 . So far , we have shown that the coupling constant κ 12 neglected in most previous studies plays an important role in determining whether the anisotropic proteins at the side of the tubular membrane can drive membrane ﬁssion and generate the morphology of the membrane neck if ﬁssion occurs . Here we propose an experimental method to estimate the value of κ 12 . It should be noted that in order to maintain the membrane at a tubular shape , a pulling force f is needed to resist the membrane from being ﬂatten since the membrane tension tends to straighten the membrane and the turgor pressure tends to push down the membrane against the cell wall . An investigation on how anisotropic proteins bound to the side of the membrane inﬂuences the force f shows that the force f increases with c 20 for the classical Helfrich model ( see curves in Fig . 6 ( a ) ) . In contrast , for the extended - Helfrich model κ 12 = 0 , the force exhibits a gentle increase followed by a decrease with the increase of c 20 ( see the blue and the red curves in Fig . 6 ( b ) ) . As for the model κ 12 = 2 κ , a sharp increase in the force f is accompanied with a small increase of the spontaneous curvature c 20 ( see blue and red curves in Fig . 6 ( c ) ) . The colored region in Fig . 5 demonstrates how the force de - pends on the combination of the coupling constant κ 12 and the spontaneous curvature c 20 . In the intermediate range of κ 12 ( 0 . 7 κ < κ 12 < 1 . 9 κ ) , the force f is almost independent of c 20 . For large κ 12 ( κ 12 < 0 . 7 κ ) , the force f has a sharp increase with c 20 . While for small and nega - tive κ 12 ( κ 12 < 1 . 9 κ ) , the force f shows a nonmonotonic dpendence on c 20 . Figure 6 . The dependence of the pulling force f on the spontaneous curvature c 20 for diﬀerent coupling constants ( a ) κ 12 = κ , ( b ) κ 12 = 0 , and ( c ) κ 12 = 2 κ . The curves could terminate at certain values of c 20 when vesiculation occurs . Pulling a membrane tube from a giant liposome with optical tweezers is a common in vitro experiment to de - termine the membrane tension and the membrane bend - ing rigidity . When the tube is formed , by ﬂowing the proteins of interests into the solution , membrane could be gradually bound with the proteins at the lateral side of the tube and the spontaneous curvature is expected to increase with the enrichment of the proteins . Measuring the force to maintain the membrane at a tubular shape in response to the growth of the protein coat , checking a ﬁgure like Fig . 5 , and reading how the force depends on the protein concentration , we can have an estimation of the range of the coupling constant for that type of proteins . BAR proteins have been proposed to be an active player in membrane ﬁssion during the late stage of endo - cytosis in yeast cells . In particular , the crescent - shaped N - BAR proteins have a typical radius of 10nm and is able to induce membrane tubulation of the same radius when the density is high enough . We have shown in the phase diagram of Fig . 5 that the coupling constant κ 12 determines whether membrane ﬁssion could happen upon increasing the spontaneous curvature c 2 0 . For strong coupling ( κ 12 > 2 κ ) , a small spontaneous curvature c 20 ( > 0 . 05 nm − 1 ) generated by the binding of BAR pro - teins is enough to induce vesiculation . However , for small positive and negative values of κ 12 , a very large sponta - neous curvature c 20 ( > 0 . 13 nm − 1 ) is needed to induce 5 vesiculation . As it is known that N - BAR proteins have a curvature of ≈ 0 . 1 nm − 1 ( smaller than 0 . 13 nm − 1 but greater than 0 . 05 nm − 1 ) , our results therefore suggest that N - BAR proteins are able to actively induce mem - brane ﬁssion not via tubular necking but via hourglass necking . As a result of the high turgor pressure inside yeast cells , maintaining the membrane at a tubular shape needs to generate a very large force . Actin polymerization is as - sumed to provide the force . However , based on the copy number analysis of actin ﬁlaments , polymerization alone seems unable to generate enough force [ 37 , 42 ] . We have found that anisotropic proteins with a coupling constant κ 12 = 0 could signiﬁcantly reduce the force to main - tain the membrane at a tubular shape from 2000 pN to 600 pN . This result provides a new perspective to ex - plain the large diﬀerence between the required force and the actual force generated by actin polymerization . In summary , we study the physics behind vesiculation phenomena via anisotropic proteins bound to the side of a tubular membrane during endocytosis . It is found that the classical Helfrich model is incapable of explaining vesiculation . Anisotropic spontaneous curvatures based on the extended - Helfrich model are needed to drive mem - brane ﬁssion . Depending on the type of anisotropic cur - vatures , the membrane tube could undergo an tubular necking or an hourglass necking . Furthermore , we sug - gest an experimental method to distinguish the type of anisotropic curvatures of a protein by comparing the force to maintain the membrane at a tubular shape in the presence and absence of the proteins .
