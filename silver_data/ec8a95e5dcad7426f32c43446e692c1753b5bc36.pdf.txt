Running head : Testing for SARS - CoV - 2 in Pregnancy Abstract Objective : Coronavirus Disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) may present asymptomatically in a large proportion of cases in endemic areas . Accordingly , universal testing has been suggested as a potential strategy for reducing transmission in the obstetrical setting . We describe the clinical characteristics of patients who tested positive for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) during pregnancy at a designated COVID - 19 hospitalization centre in Montreal , Quebec . Methods : A single - centre retrospective cohort was constructed to include all pregnant patients who tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 between March 22 and July 31 , 2020 , and received care at the Jewish General Hospital . Initially , testing was restricted to at - risk patients , identified through the use of a screening questionnaire . Beginning on May 15 , 2020 , universal testing was implemented , and all pregnant patients admitted to hospital were tested . Data were collected through chart review . Results : Of 803 patients tested for SARS - CoV - 2 during the study period , 41 ( 5 % ) tested positive . Among those patients who were symptomatic , the most commonly reported symptoms were cough ( 53 % ) , fever ( 37 % ) , dyspnea ( 30 % ) , and anosmia and / or ageusia ( 20 % ) . Prior to the implementation of universal testing , 13 % ( 3 / 24 ) of patients with SARS - CoV - 2 were asymptomatic . Following the implementation of universal testing , 80 % ( 8 / 10 ) of patients with SARS - CoV - 2 were asymptomatic . Conclusion : Our findings suggest that most pregnant patients with SARS - CoV - 2 are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms of COVID - 19 . Particularly in endemic areas , universal testing of pregnant patients presenting to hospital should be strongly considered as an important measure to prevent in - hospital and community transmission of COVID - 19 . Key Words : COVID - 19 , coronavirus , pregnancy , symptoms , asymptomatic , universal testing Introduction The Coronavirus Disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) pandemic represents an unprecedented global health crisis . The province of Quebec has seen the greatest number of cases in Canada . 1 While the majority of COVID - 19 related deaths have occurred in the elderly population , cases of severe and critical COVID - 19 have been reported across all demographics , including in pregnant women . 2 Due to pregnancy - related immunological changes , pregnant women are more susceptible to severe manifestations of certain viral infections . 3 Variable symptom presentations between pregnant and non - pregnant women with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) have been described . 4 Furthermore , in certain endemic areas , asymptomatic presentations among obstetrical patients has been reported in over 80 % of cases . 5 Undetected SARS - CoV - 2 in pregnancy presents a unique challenge , as patients must interact closely with health care professionals throughout pregnancy , and during labour and delivery . Universal testing of pregnant patients has been suggested as a potential strategy for protecting patients and health care workers from COVID - 19 . 5 This study describes the initial experience of a tertiary care centre in Montreal , Canada in screening and testing pregnant patients with COVID - 19 . For scientific accuracy and to maintain standardization of scientific communications , this paper will refer to the novel Coronavirus Disease as COVID - 19 and to the associated Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - related Coronavirus 2 as SARS - CoV - 2 . Methods The Jewish General Hospital ( JGH ) is a tertiary care centre in Montreal , Quebec and a teaching site for McGill University . The JGH provides specialized obstetrical care , handling over 4 , 000 births annually , and comprises a Level III Neonatal Intensive Care Unit ( NICU ) . Quebec , and more specifically Montreal , is described as the epicenter of the COVID - 19 pandemic in Canada . As one of the first designated COVID - 19 hospitalization centres in Quebec and a referral centre for pregnancies affected by COVID - 19 , the JGH is therefore uniquely situated to report valuable data on its experience with screening and testing pregnant patients for SARS - CoV - 2 . 6 For this study , a retrospective cohort was constructed to include pregnant patients who tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 between March 22 and July 31 , 2020 and received care at the JGH . Patients were identified according to a prospective log maintained on the hospital’s Labour and Delivery Unit and continuously updated by members of the obstetrical care team to reflect all pregnant patients who tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 and received care on the unit or elsewhere in the hospital . Case identification was cross - checked with nursing records maintained in the Post - Partum Unit . In all cases , SARS - CoV - 2 testing was performed with polymerase - chain - reaction ( PCR ) on nasopharyngeal swabs . Data on maternal demographics and clinical characteristics were extracted from electronic medical records . Baseline maternal characteristics collected included age , obstetrical history , gestational age at time of first positive SARS - CoV - 2 test result , and presence of medical comorbidities . Clinical characteristics related to SARS - CoV - 2 included presenting symptoms , including asymptomatic presentation , timing of onset of symptoms , severity of disease , and disposition . Additional details were collected for patients requiring antepartum in - hospital care for COVID - 19 . This study was conducted in accordance with the TCPS 2 , Tri - Council Policy Statement : Ethical Conduct for Research Involving Humans ( 2018 ) and was approved by the Research Ethics Board of the CIUSSS West - Central Montreal ( Project # 2021 - 2346 ) . Results A total of 41 patients with SARS - CoV - 2 during pregnancy were included in this cohort . This included 24 patients who tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 during the period of time when a screening questionnaire , which included questions on symptoms , travel and symptomatic and / or SARS - CoV - 2 positive contacts , was used within the Labour and Delivery Unit to screen patients at risk of infection ( March 22 to May 14 , 2020 ) , and ten patients who tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 after universal testing was implemented ( May 15 to July 31 , 2020 ) . In addition , six patients ( 6 / 41 ; 15 % ) were admitted directly from the Emergency Department after presenting there with symptoms of COVID - 19 , and one patient was transferred from an outside hospital for preterm labour with a prior diagnosis of COVID - 19 ( Figure 1 ) . During the period when the screening questionnaire was used , 141 patients were tested for SARS - CoV - 2 upon admission , of which 24 tested positive ( 24 / 141 ; 17 % ) . One patient was asymptomatic on admission and was subsequently tested in the context of intrapartum fever . Another patient was tested only after delivery despite the presence of mild symptoms due to a language barrier preventing accurate completion of the admission screening questionnaire . During the period when universal screening was performed , 662 patients were tested , ten ( 10 / 662 ; 1 . 5 % ) of whom tested positive . Maternal demographic and clinical characteristics are summarized in Table 1 . The majority ( 35 / 41 ; 85 % ) of patients had no comorbid medical conditions . Among symptomatic women who tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 , the most common presenting symptoms were cough ( 53 % ) , fever ( 37 % ) , dyspnea ( 30 % ) , and anosmia and / or ageusia ( 20 % ) . ( Figure 2 ) . Prior to the implementation of universal testing , 13 % ( 3 / 24 ) of those who tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 were asymptomatic throughout admission . Following the implementation of universal testing , 80 % ( 8 / 10 ) of patients who tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 were asymptomatic throughout admission . According to the definition of mild , severe , and critical disease proposed by Wu et al . 7 , and subsequently utilized by others , 8 83 % of patients had mild disease , 12 % had severe disease , and 5 % had critical disease . The majority of patients ( 34 / 41 ; 83 % ) did not require in - hospital care for COVID - 19 . Of the seven patients ( 17 % ) who required admission for COVID - 19 , five had one or more medical comorbidities and two had a twin pregnancy . Seven patients ( 17 % ) required supplemental oxygen therapy , with Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) admission in three patients ( 7 % ) requiring supplemental oxygen and close monitoring and two patients ( 5 % ) requiring mechanical ventilation . There were no maternal deaths . Discussion We found that most pregnant patients with SARS - CoV - 2 are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms of COVID - 19 . Among patients with symptoms , fever , cough , dyspnea and anosmia and / or ageusia were among the most frequently reported symptoms . Our study revealed certain similarities and differences compared to the current literature on COVID - 19 symptoms in non - pregnant and pregnant adults . In a meta - analysis of 43 studies involving 3600 non - pregnant patients , most patients were symptomatic . 9 The most common symptoms were fever , cough , and fatigue reported in 83 % , 60 % , and 38 % of patients , respectively . 9 Similarly , in a meta - analysis of 33 studies involving 385 pregnant patients , most patients were symptomatic . 10 Fever and cough were also among the most commonly reported symptoms , in 93 % and 67 % of patients , respectively . 10 In contrast , the symptom distribution in our patient population differed . While cough and fever were the most commonly reported symptoms , these were less frequently reported compared to previous studies . In addition , dyspnea and anosmia and / or ageusia were among the most commonly reported symptoms in pregnant patients with COVID - 19 in our cohort . Early published case studies on COVID - 19 reported similar disease severity between pregnant and non - pregnant adults . 8 , 11 , 12 However , initial reports compared disease severity between pregnant and non - pregnant patients without accounting for age differences in these two populations , thus potentially providing some premature reassurance regarding the vulnerability of pregnant women to severe and critical manifestations of COVID - 19 . 8 , 11 More recently , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) reported on data from 8 , 207 pregnant women with SARS - CoV - 2 . Compared to 83 , 205 non - pregnant women of reproductive age with SARS - CoV - 2 , those who were pregnant were significantly more likely to be admitted to the ICU ( aRR 1 . 5 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 1 . 2 - 1 . 8 ) and to receive mechanical ventilation ( aRR 1 . 7 , 95 % CI 1 . 2 - 2 . 4 ) . 4 Thus , vigilance needs to be maintained regarding COVID - 19 in the pregnant population . Similar to the experience with universal testing for SARS - CoV - 2 in pregnant patients admitted for delivery described by others , we report on a patient who was initially asymptomatic on admission , developed intrapartum fever and subsequently tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 . 5 This event , in combination with previous findings suggesting that , in endemic regions , asymptomatic presentations among pregnant patients may be common , prompted the implementation of universal testing within our Labour and Delivery Unit . 5 The finding that most new cases detected since the implementation of a universal testing policy were among asymptomatic patients ( 8 / 10 ; 80 % ) supports the continued use of universal testing within our Labour and Delivery Unit . As a designated COVID - 19 hospitalization centre in Canada’s epicenter for COVID - 19 , this study provides valuable data on the initial Canadian experience screening and testing pregnant patients for SARS - CoV - 2 . Our study includes patients who presented to hospital for COVID - 19 symptoms and / or obstetrical concerns , and we were able to discern which patients required in - hospital care for COVID - 19 symptoms specifically . Unfortunately , however , we were unable to include patients who may have tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 but did not seek care at our hospital . Conclusion Since the implementation of universal testing within the Labour and Delivery Unit , the majority of cases of SARS - CoV - 2 were detected in asymptomatic carriers . As the province of Quebec now faces a second wave of infection , rates of infection among our universally tested obstetrical population may serve as an early warning sign of increasing infection rates in the province . Therefore , universal testing should be maintained , and may serve as a strategy for monitoring and preventing transmission within the Labour and Delivery Unit and within the community .
