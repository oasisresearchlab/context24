It is encoded by the X - chromosome and more than 200 mutations have been linked to the neurodevelopmental PCDH - clustering epilepsy ( PCDH19 - CE ) syndrome . A disturbed cell - cell contact that arises when random X - inactivation creates mosaic absence of PCDH19 has been proposed to cause the syndrome . Several studies have shown roles for PCDH19 in neuronal proliferation , migration , and synapse function , yet most of them have focused on cortical and hippocampal neurons . As epilepsy can also be caused by impaired interneuron migration , we studied the role of PCDH19 in cortical interneurons during embryogenesis . We show that cortical interneuron migration is affected by altering PCDH19 dosage by means of overexpression in brain slices and medial ganglionic eminence ( MGE ) explants . We also detect subtle defects when PCDH19 expression was reduced in MGE explants , suggesting that the dosage of PCDH19 is important for proper interneuron migration . We conﬁrm this ﬁnding in vivo by showing a mild reduction in interneuron migration in heterozygote , but not in homozygote PCDH19 knockout animals . In addition , we provide evidence that subdomains of PCDH19 have a different impact on cell survival and interneuron migration . Intriguingly , we also observed domain - dependent differences in migration of the non - targeted cell population in explants , demonstrating a non - cell - autonomous effect of PCDH19 dosage changes . Overall , our ﬁndings suggest new roles for the extracellular and cytoplasmic domains of PCDH19 and support that cortical interneuron migration is dependent on balanced PCDH19 dosage .

These cells also make local microcircuits with GABAergic interneurons , which provide inhibitory input into these assemblies . The balance between excitation and inhibition needs to be perfectly controlled for the brain to function properly . Unlike the pyramidal neurons that are formed within the cortex and migrate radially to the cortical plate , interneurons originally derive from the medial and caudal ganglionic eminences ( MGE and CGE resp . ) during embryonic development ( Marín , 2013 ) . From there , they migrate tangentially to the cortex , guided by diﬀerent extrinsic cues that are either repulsive or attractive ( Marín et al . , 2010 ) . Besides extrinsic cues , neurons also make use of membrane - bound factors to read their environment while migrating ( van den Berghe et al . , 2014 ) . Defects in the migration of these cells to the cortex lead to a disturbed balance between excitation and inhibition that can ultimately result in severe early - onset epilepsy ( van den Berghe et al . , 2013 ) . PCDH19 is the second most prevalent gene linked to early infantile epileptic encephalopathy ( EIEE ) and causes EIEE9 ( OMIM # 300088 ) ( Dibbens et al . , 2008 ; Jamal et al . , 2010 ; Depienne et al . , 2011 ; Duszyc et al . , 2015 ) , a disorder ﬁrst described by Juberg and Hellman ( 1971 ) . Recently , this disorder has been renamed to PCDH19 - Clustering Epilepsy ( CE ) ( Gecz and Thomas , 2020 ) . Patients with PCDH19 - CE suﬀer from epilepsy already early after birth . In addition to suﬀering from epileptic seizures , 75 percent of these patients also present with variable cognitive impairment ( Cappelletti et al . , 2015 ) , and psychiatric comorbidities , such as hyperactivity , obsessive - compulsive behavior , and autism , have been most frequently reported ( Kolc et al . , 2019 ) . The pattern of inheritance of this disorder is very peculiar . PCDH19 is coded by the X - chromosome , yet only females have the disorder , whereas carrier fathers do not have seizures . The discovery of several mosaic male patients suﬀering from the disease ( Depienne et al . , 2009 ; Terracciano et al . , 2016 ; Thiﬀault et al . , 2016 ; Kolc et al . , 2019 ) showed that the co - existence of cells expressing the wild - type PCDH19 and cells without PCDH19 has a detrimental impact on brain function ( Depienne et al . , 2009 ; Kolc et al . , 2019 ) . This situation occurs naturally in females after random inactivation of the X chromosome , or in males that have a somatic mutation during early development and become mosaic for PCDH19 . Depienne et al . postulated that the mosaicism might lead to impaired cell - cell communication or “cellular interference” ( Depienne et al . , 2012 ) . Mice heterozygous for PCDH19 showed relatively minor abnormalities in the brain , yet a striking homotypical clustering of the PCDH19 KO and WT cells within the forebrain correlated with impaired network activity ( Pederick et al . , 2016 , 2018 ) . Lamination of the cortex was not aﬀected and included the presence of cortical interneurons in normal numbers ( Galindo - Riera et al . , 2021 ) . Nevertheless , minor changes have been observed when studying the behavior of these mice , and PCDH19 has been implicated in mossy ﬁber synapse formation , supporting the idea that PCDH19 has an important role in establishment and plasticity of micro - circuitry ( Galindo - Riera et al . , 2021 ; Hoshina et al . , 2021 ) . PCDH19 is a member of the non - clustered δ 2 - type protocadherins , has 6 cadherin repeats in the extracellular part , and a cytoplasmic tail containing two conserved domains ( CM1 and CM2 ) ( Wolverton and Lalande , 2001 ; Vanhalst et al . , 2005 ; Hulpiau and van Roy , 2009 ; Kim et al . , 2011 ) . It has only limited adhesive capacity through homophilic interactions but becomes strongly adhesive upon interaction with Cdh2 ( N - Cadherin ) ( Biswas et al . , 2010 ; Emond et al . , 2011 ) . In zebraﬁsh , PCDH19 knockdown disturbs the convergent movement of cells during the formation of the neural tube , indicating a role in early neural cell migration ( Emond et al . , 2009 ) . The cytoplasmic domain of PCDH19 interacts with the WAVE regulatory complex through the so - called WIRS motif ( Chen et al . , 2014 ) . This interaction is of particular importance since the WAVE regulatory complex controls cytoskeletal remodeling ( essential during cell migration ) , and WAVE complex components , such as CYFIP2 , are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders ( Takenawa and Miki , 2001 ; Tai et al . , 2010 ; Abekhoukh and Bardoni , 2014 ; Chen et al . , 2014 ) . This cytoplasmic interaction with the WAVE regulatory complex is shared with several other PCDHs , such as the related PCDH17 , which plays a role in collective axon extension ( Hayashi et al . , 2014 ) . The cytoplasmic domain of PCDH19 is proteolytically cleaved oﬀ upon neural activation in hippocampal neurons , and relocates to the nucleus to stimulate gene transcription of immediate early genes ( Gerosa et al . , 2022 ) . Whether such cleavage takes place during embryogenesis has not been shown . While other studies have assessed PCDH19 migration in hippocampal neurons ( Bassani et al . , 2018 ) or in in vitro studies in neurospheres derived from cortical neurons ( Pederick et al . , 2016 ) , to our knowledge , the role of PCDH19 has not been assessed in cortical interneuron migration before . Here , we tested the hypothesis that PCDH19 is important for cortical interneuron migration . We found that PCDH19 is expressed dynamically during embryogenesis in the regions generating cortical interneurons , as well as in interneurons invading the cortex . By mimicking the PCDH19 dosage imbalance between cells in ex vivo assays , we found that a loss of PCDH19 is less detrimental to migration compared to overdosing . In explants , dosage changes of particular PCDH19 subdomains non - autonomously aﬀected migration of non - targeted cells . In addition , we revealed cell - autonomous FrontiersinNeuroscience 02 frontiersin . org Pancho et al . 10 . 3389 / fnins . 2022 . 887478 domain - speciﬁc roles of the PCDH19 protein in migration and apoptosis , and conﬁrmed an in vivo role for PCDH19 in interneuron migration . Materials and methods Animals All animal experiments were conducted in compliance with the European union and Belgian laws in accordance with the guidelines of the Ethical Committee Animal Experimentation of the KU Leuven ( P267 / 2015 ) . Mice were maintained on CD1 Swiss genetic background . The CD1 mice were crossed with transgenic Dlx5 / 6cre - IRES - eGFP mice strain , which labels telencephalic interneurons green ( Dlx5 / 6 - Cre - IRES - eGFP ) ( Stenman et al . , 2003 ) . The mice were kept in a 14 / 10 - h light - dark cycle in a humidity - and temperature - controlled pathogen free animal unit . Timed matings were performed to obtain pregnant female mice , and a plug check was done every day early in the morning to conﬁrm mating . The vaginal plug day was considered as E0 . 5 . Dlx5 / 6 - Cre - IRES - eGFP positive embryos were veriﬁed under a ﬂuorescence binocular microscope ( SteREO Discovery . V8 ; Zeiss ; Oberkochen ; Germany ) . Dissection of mouse brains was done in cold phosphate - buﬀered saline ( PBS ) and ﬁxation in 4 % w / v paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) / PBS for 16 – 24 h at 4 ◦ C . After ﬁxation , samples were washed two times in PBS and then placed into a storage buﬀer ( 0 . 01 % w / v thimerosal / PBS ) to preserve the brains . In addition , mouse tail biopsy samples ( ∼ 5mm ) were also collected for DNA extraction and genotyping of the embryos . Cre genotyping PCR reaction was done with a GoTAQ Polymerase ( Promega ) . The used forward and reverse primer sequences are shown in Supplementary Table S1 . Initial denaturation was performed at 94 ◦ C for 4 min . Cycling was done for 35 cycles with a denaturation at 94 ◦ C for 30s , primer annealing at 58 ◦ C for 30 s and elongation at 72 ◦ C for 30s . The ﬁnal elongation was done for 7 min at 72 ◦ C and then cooled down to 4 ◦ C . The PCR product was visualized on a 1 % agarose gel . Cloning of PCDH19 tagged overexpression constructs PCDH19 FL , ECDTM , ICD , and ICD 1 NLS constructs were obtained from a plasmid containing the full - length murine sequence ( PCDH19FL ) and cloned into a second plasmid containing the green ﬂuorescent protein ( eGFP ) behind a cytomegalovirus promoter . Primer sequences to generate the PCR products are shown in Supplementary Table S2 . PCDH19ICDeGFP and PCDH19ICD 1 NLSeGFP were generated using tail PCR , and PCDH19FLeGFP and PCDH19ECDTMeGFP were generated using dovetail PCR . Finally , all PCDH19eGFP constructs were recloned into a pCAGGS plasmid , expressing IRES - TdTomato . Generation of PCDH19 - V5 and PCDH19 KO mice All the primers used to generate the PCDH19 - V5 and PCDH19 KO mouse lines were ordered from IDT . These mouse lines were created in the lab of Bernhard Schermer . Single - guide RNA generation In order to generate the single - guide RNA ( sgRNA ) , a PCR reaction was done . The PCR was done with the Q5 High - Fidelity Polymerase ( NEB ) . The used forward and reverse primer sequences are shown in Supplementary Table S3 . As a PCR template , the pSpCas9 ( BB ) - 2APuro ( Px459 ) V 2 . 0 ( Addgene62988 ) was used . Initial denaturation was performed at 98 ◦ C for 30 s . Cycling was done for 30 cycles with a denaturation at 98 ◦ C for 10 s , primer annealing at 60 ◦ C for 30s , and elongation at 72 ◦ C for 10s . The ﬁnal elongation was done for 2 min at 72 ◦ C and then cooled down to 10 ◦ C . Gel extraction A 1 % gel was done to extract the PCR product . To visualize the PCR reaction , 2 µ l loading dye was added to the reaction . The complete PCR product was loaded onto the gel . The electrophoresis was done for 30min at 90 V . The gel - extracted band had a size of 120 bp . Gel extraction was performed using the Qiagen gel extraction kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Elution was performed in a 30 µ l elution buﬀer . After elution the concentration was measured using the Nanodrop . In order to verify the extraction , 2 µ l of the extracted DNA was loaded into a 1 % gel . In vitro transcription The HiScribe T7 High - Yield RNA Synthesis Kit ( NEBE2040S ) was used to transcribe the DNA into RNA . The reaction was set for short transcripts ( < 0 . 3 kb ) . A reaction of 20 µ l was set up where the ﬁnal concentration of the reaction buﬀer was 0 . 75X . About 11 µ l was used of the template gel - extracted DNA . About 1 . 5 µ l was used from the T7 RNA polymerase mix . The transcription was performed for 16h overnight at 37 ◦ C . To verify if the transcription was successful , FrontiersinNeuroscience 03 frontiersin . org Pancho et al . 10 . 3389 / fnins . 2022 . 887478 2 µ l of the obtained unpuriﬁed RNA was loaded on a 2 % agarose gel . RNA puriﬁcation For the puriﬁcation , the RNeasy kit ( Qiagen ) was used . About 700 µ l of QIAzol lysis reagent was added to the sample to homogenize . The homogenate was incubated at room temperature for 5min . After chloroform extraction , samples were loaded on the RNeasy mini column in a 2 - ml collection tube . The samples were eluted in 30 – 50 µ l RNAse free water . Concentration of the eluted RNA was measured on a 1 : 10 diluted sample and veriﬁed on a 2 % gel . Generation of mouse lines via electroporation of zygotes Mouse generation was done according to Tröder et al . ( 2018 ) . For the PCDH19 - V5 mouse line , 4 - µ M sgRNA , 4 - µ M Cas9protein , and 10 - µ M ssODN were used . sgRNA was made as described above and the repair template ordered from IDT ( sequences in Supplementary Table S3 ) . For the PCDH19 KO mouse line , 4 µ M of SpCas9 WT protein was complexed with a mix of 4 diﬀerent guide RNAs ( 2 µ M each ) , targeting a large deletion . Guide RNAs were ordered via IDT as crRNA ( IDT , Alt - RTM crRNA ) ( sequences in Supplementary Table S3 ) and used together with the tracrRNA ( IDT , 1072532 ) . Genotyping A small ear biopsy was collected at weaning and used as well for identiﬁcation of the mouse . Ear biopsy was deposited into a sterile Eppendorf tube and incubated with a 200 µ l lysis buﬀer [ 1 - M Tris - HCl ( pH = 8 . 5 ) , 0 . 5 - M EDTA ( pH = 8 ) , 10 % sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) , and 5 - M NaCl ] , containing 1 : 100 Proteinase K ( 10 µ g / µ l in 40 % glycerol / nuclease free water ) at 56 ◦ C overnight . Pcdh19 - V5 and KO Genotyping PCR reaction was done with a GoTAQ Polymerase . The used forward and reverse primer sequences are shown in Supplementary Table S4 . Initial denaturation was performed at 94 ◦ C for 3min . Cycling was done for 34 cycles with a denaturation at 94 ◦ C for 30 s , primer annealing at 60 ◦ C for 30s , and elongation at 72 ◦ C for 1min . The ﬁnal elongation was done for 10min at 72 ◦ C and then cooled down to 10 ◦ C . The PCR product was visualized on a 2 % agarose gel . Primers are in Supplementary Table S4 . In situ hybridization A 560 base pair fragment of the mouse PCDH19 gene exon1 was cloned into a pJET1 . 2 vector . In vitro transcription was done using 1 µ g as a template of the linearized plasmid , using the T7 DIG RNA labeling kit ( Roche , Sigma - Aldrich ) . Puriﬁcation of the RNA was done using the Micro Bio - Spin TM P30 gel columns ( Bio - rad ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions , and RNA concentration was measured using the SimpliNano spectrometer ( Biochrom ) . All the ISH were done on 6 - µ m paraﬃn sections using an automated platform ( Ventana Discovery , Roche ) . About 200 ng of dioxigenin labeled probe was diluted in RiboHybe ( Roche ) and vortexed prior to use . After deparaﬃnation via heat , slides underwent pre - treatment with a citrate buﬀer ( pH = 6 . ) at 95 ◦ C and with proteinase K at 37 ◦ C for 4min . The probe in the aforementioned amount was added per slide , and denaturation was performed at 80 ◦ C . Next , hybridization was performed for 6h at 65 ◦ C . Several washes had occurred before the anti - DIG antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase was added at the concentration of 1 : 1 , 000 , followed by an incubation of 8h with the substrate ( BlueMap Detection Kit , Roche ) . Slides were manually dehydrated in a graded ethanol dilution and mounted with Eukitt ( Sigma ) . Brightﬁeld images were acquired using a LeicaDM6 B microscope connected to a digital CMOS camera ( DMC2900 , Leica ) with the LAS Xsoftware suite ( Leica ) . Further processing was done with Fiji and GIMP or Photoshop . Hybridization chain reaction This protocol is an adaptation of the HCR3 . 0 protocol described in Choi et al . ( 2018 ) . We refer to buﬀer compositions described in this protocol , and used the method described in Elagoz et al . ( 2022 ) for probe design . To ensure the probe could distinguish WT from KO , we used the ∼ 1 , 000 bp PCDH19 sequence that was deleted in the PCDH19 KO mice as input for the probe generator . Oﬀ - target probes were identiﬁed using BlastN and were excluded from the probe set . DNA oligo pools from the designed probes were ordered from Integrated DNA Technologies ( IDT ) , dissolved in UltraPureTM DNase / RNase - Free Distilled Water ( Invitrogen ) and stored at − 20 ◦ C . HCR B2 ampliﬁer labeled with Alexa Fluor R (cid:13) 647 was ordered from Molecular Instruments . Components of all used buﬀers and solutions as well as the sequences for the DNA probe sets are listed in Supplementary Tables S5 – S9 . Before starting the protocol , vibratome sections were placed in a 24 - well plate ( maximum , three sections per well ) . First , tissues were permeabilized with 600 µ l of a permeabilization buﬀer ( 1 % DMSO , 1 % Triton - X in autoclaved PBS ) for 2h at 37 ◦ C in a humidiﬁed surrounding in the dark . Next , a permeabilization buﬀer was replaced with a 600 µ l pre - warmed FrontiersinNeuroscience 04 frontiersin . org Pancho et al . 10 . 3389 / fnins . 2022 . 887478 TABLE 1 Probe wash steps for the HCRv3 protocol .

In the meantime , HCR probes were thawed on ice , spun , and a 12 nmol DNA probe was diluted in a 200 µ l pre - warmed probe hybridization buﬀer ( probe solution ) per well or glass slide . After incubation , the probe hybridization buﬀer was replaced by 200 µ l of probe solution . Tissue was incubated for 18h at 37 ◦ C in a humidiﬁed surrounding in the dark . The next day , excess probes were washed from the tissue in several wash steps ( 600 µ l of each wash solution , see Table 1 ) at 37 ◦ C in a humidiﬁed surrounding in the dark . To amplify the probe , the last wash solution was replaced by a 600 µ l ampliﬁcation buﬀer , and tissue was incubated for at least 30 min at RT in a humidiﬁed surrounding in the dark . Next , 9 pmol of both ampliﬁcation hairpins ( H1 and H2 ) per well or glass slide was pipetted into pcr - tubes , heated at 95 ◦ C for 90s , immediately put on ice for 5 min , and incubated at RT for 30min in the dark . Next , the hairpins were individually dissolved in the ampliﬁcation buﬀer ( 100 µ l per 9 pmol hairpin ) before they were combined and mixed well ( hairpin solution ) . The ampliﬁcation buﬀer was replaced with 200 µ l hairpin solution . Tissue was incubated for 16 h at RT in a humidiﬁed surrounding in the dark . The following day excess hairpins were removed by washing tissue three times with 600 µ l of 5X SSCT for 10min . Next , sections were stained with DAPI and mounted . A control condition in a well was included in which probe solution was replaced by a 300 µ l probe hybridization buﬀer , and hairpin solution was replaced by a 300 µ l ampliﬁcation buﬀer . Thus , these sections were not treated with probes and hairpins to control for autoﬂuorescence of the tissue . Protein isolation and western blotting Depending on the experiment , MGE , LGE and CGE was dissected out of 10 embryos at stage E13 . 5 and pooled per brain region ( Figure 1J ) or individual whole telencephalon ( Figures 1E , J ) , ventral telencephalon ( Figure 1J ) or entire brain ( Supplementary Figure 1F ) were isolated . For protein isolation and quantiﬁcation , the tissue lysates were homogenized in a 100 µ l / sample ASBA buﬀer [ 1 % Triton - X - 100 , 0 . 1 % SDS , 1 - mM EDTA , 50 - mM NaCl , 20 - mM Trizma base ( pH = 7 . 5 ) ] and 4 µ l / sample cocktail protease inhibitor solution ( Roche ) . The homogenization was performed mechanically with a drill for 5 - x - 10 s / sample and kept on ice . Afterwards , the brain samples were centrifuged for 5min at 13 . 000 rpm at 4 ◦ C . Supernatants were collected , and the Qubit Protein Assay Kit ( Invitrogen ) was used to determine protein concentration of the brain lysates . About 15 µ g of the protein lysates was loaded on a precasted 4 – 12 % Criterion XT Bis - Tris 26 well - gel of Biorad and blotted on a PVDF membrane using the Trans Turbo Blot from BioRad ( 7min ) . Next , the membranes were dehydrated in Tris - saline for 5min and incubated with a blocking buﬀer for the following 2h . All the washing and incubation steps occurred at room temperature ( RT ) and placed on the shaker . After the 2 - h incubation , the membrane was incubated with the PCDH19 primary antibody ( Bethyl A304 - 468A ) diluted 1 / 1 , 000 and left overnight to incubate . The next day , blots were rinsed 3 x 5min with Tris - saline and incubated with the secondary antibody solution with HRP - labeled antibodies ( GAR : Goat Anti - Rabbit ) 1 / 10 , 000 in the blocking buﬀer for 30 min . Next , membranes were rinsed with Tris - saline ( 2 × 5min ) and incubated with Tris - Stock ( 1 × 5min ) . After the Tris - Stock incubation , the Clarity western ECL substrate kit ( BioRad ) was used to reveal the blots . Imaging of the membranes occurred with the imaging system ( BioRad ) . The membranes were stripped using a Restore western blot stripping buﬀer of Thermo Scientiﬁc . Next , the membrane was rinsed again with Tris - saline ( 3 × 5min ) and incubated with the blocking buﬀer for 2h . The membranes were incubated overnight with GADPH 1 / 1 , 000 ( GAPDH Millipore cat nr : MAB374 ) in the blocking buﬀer . The next day , a HRP - labeled antibody ( Goat Anti - Mouse ) 1 / 25 , 000 solution was added and , afterwards , imaged with the BioRad imaging system . Organotrophic slice electroporation One day before the actual experiment , Millicell Cell Culture inserts with a pore size of 0 . 4 µ m were coated with poly - L - Lysin ( Sigma ) and Laminin ( Sigma ) . Coated inserts were placed in PBS into a 6 - well plate overnight at 37 ◦ C in the cell culture incubator . On the next day , coating solution was removed , and inserts were placed on top of a slice culture medium . Dlx5 / 6 - Cre - IRES - eGFP E13 . 5 brains were dissected in ice - cold L15 + + ( a Leibovitz‘s L15 medium , supplemented with glucose and Hepes ) . Subsequently , the dissected brains were embedded in 4 % low - melting point agarose in L15 + + . Polymerization was obtained after 1h on ice . Next , coronal slices of 300 µ m were obtained with the vibratome and collected in L15 + + media .

Sectioned slices were placed on top of a membrane and placed on top of an agarose bed , previously prepared into the square well of a Petri dish square platinum electrode ( CUY701P20E , Nepagene ) . Injection was performed under a binocular ( Leica ) into the MGE . For OE Plasmids , we injected at a concentration of 2 µ g / µ l . To generate the LOF , clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats ( CRISPR - Cas9 ) components were pre complexed to ribonucleoprotein ( RNP ) in an Opti - Mem medium for at least 20 min at room temperature injected at the amount of 380 ng for the guide ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) and 300 ng for the Cas9 protein . All LOF compounds were mixed with pCAGGS plasmid at a concentration of 1 µ g / µ l in order to trace the electroporated cells . To visualize the injection site , Fast Green was used at an amount of 1 µ l per 33 µ l . For the negative electrode , an agarose cylinder of 1 % was attached to the cover square of platinum plate electrode ( CUY701P20L , Nepagene ) . Electroporation was performed using the following settings : 5 pulses , 150V with a pulse length duration of 5ms using 100 - ms intervals . A BTX electroporator ( ECM830 , Harvard Apparatus ) was used . Subsequently , after electroporation , electroporated sliced were placed on top of the coated inserts and placed on ice . Three slices with the same condition were placed on top of an insert . After all the inserts were covered with slices , the slices were cultivated in the cell culture incubator . After 2 days in vitro ( div ) , 500 µ l of the used slice culture media was removed and refreshed with new slice culture media . After 3 div slices were ﬁxed in 4 % PFA for at least 2h , stained with DAPI and mounted on microscope slides with Mowiol and imaged with the confocal microscope ( Olympus ) . Analysis was performed using ImageJ software , total amount of TdT positive cells was quantiﬁed within every slide side , and the proportion or cells reaching the cortex compared to the total amount was calculated . Statistical signiﬁcance was determined using a Kruskal Wallis multicomparison test with Dunn‘s post hoc test . MGE explants in Matrigel culture At E13 . 5 Dlx5 / 6 - Cre - IRES - eGFP embryos were dissected from the mother in L15 + + media . Embryos were kept on ice , while the skin and meninges were removed . Subsequently , the neocortex ( NCTX ) was open up from the top , superﬁcially , in order to expose the GEs . Injection into the MGE was performed using approximately 10 injection sites per MGE . The same injection mixtures and amount of OE plasmids and CRISPR - Cas9 components as used for the slice electroporation ( slice EP ) were used . Subsequently , after injection in both MGEs , electroporation was performed using the following settings , 5 pulses , 50 V with a pulse length duration of 50ms using 1 - s intervals . Electrodes ( CUY650P5 tweezer electrodes ) connected to a BTX electroporator ( Harvard Apparatus ) were placed on each side of the embryonic head at the position of the ears . After electroporation embryos were kept at 4 ◦ C for 3 h in L15 + + . Meanwhile , the matrigel was thawed in ice . Matrigel was diluted in a 1 : 1 ratio with complete neuro basal media . After the incubation period , MGE was dissected from the embryos , and each MGE was cut into small pieces . Subsequently , these pieces were embedded carefully into the neurobasal media - diluted matrigel and placed as matrigel drops containing the piece into 35 - mm glass bottom imaging ( Ibidi ) dishes . Once placed into the dish , the Matrigel containing explant was allowed to polymerize at 37 ◦ C . After polymerization , the explant was surrounded with complete neurobasal media and cultured in the cell culture incubator for 2 days . After 2 div explants were ﬁxed with 4 % PFA and imaged with the confocal microscope ( Olympus ) . Stacks were projected with the Image J software , and analysis of migration from the explant was performed FrontiersinNeuroscience 07 frontiersin . org Pancho et al . 10 . 3389 / fnins . 2022 . 887478 using Cell Proﬁler software ( McQuin et al . , 2018 ; Stirling et al . , 2021 ) . Statistical signiﬁcance was determined using the Mann – Whitney U Test for the sample size of 2 and with the Kruskal – Wallis non - parametric test and the Dunn’s post hoc test for bigger sample sizes . Cell proﬁler analysis migration from the explant The following cell proﬁler pipeline for analysis with the following modules was used . The z - projected image of the explant and the red ﬂuorescence channel for the positive TdT cells were used as starting images for the images module . Metadata was extracted from the image ﬁle . The explant brightﬁeld image and the TdT cell image were deﬁned with names and types . We used “identify primary objects” as modules to detect the explant and the TdT neurons . The explant was deﬁned with the Cell proﬁler as one primary object . All the TdT neurons cell bodies were identiﬁed as primary objects ; the result was veriﬁed . Once all objects were identiﬁed , we used the two - module mask objects and relate objects . In the relate object module , the explant was set as a parent object and the neuron cell bodies as child objects . Using this module , distance between the parent object and all child objects was measured . Distances were obtained in pixels . Transforming of pixels into µ m was achieved using the conversion factor stored in the . oib ﬁle using Image J . Finally , Graph Pad Prism 8 . 3 . 0 was used to determine the statistical signiﬁcance . MGE explant morphological analysis Morphological analysis of MGE explant - derived neurons was performed using the SNT ImageJ plugin ( Longair et al . , 2011 ; Arshadi et al . , 2021 ) . A minimum of 4 explants obtained from at least two experimental replicates were analyzed per treatment group . Means per experimental group were compared with the Kruskal – Wallis non - parametric test and the Dunn’s post hoc test for a sample size bigger than 2 and with the Mann – Whitney U test for the comparison between two samples . Polarity analysis was compared across experimental conditions using two - way repeated measures ANOVA with Holm - Sidak post hoc comparison . Neuronal category frequencies were compared between neuronal morphology and experimental groups using two - way repeated measures ANOVA with Holm - Sidak post hoc comparison . Cell culture and transfection N2A cells were grown in DMEM high glucose supplemented with 2 - mM L - glutamine , 1 % penicillin / streptamycin , and 10 % fetal bovine serum albumine ( Neuro2A media ) . For confocal microscopy , we used glass bottom dishes ( Ibidi ) and pre coated them with geltrex at least 3 h prior seeding ; for the rest of applications , we used 6 - well plates . One day prior , transfection cells were seeded to a density of 5 × 10 5 ( a 6 - well plate ) and 5 × 10 4 ( Ibididish ) and left to adhere . On the day of the transfection , the cells were checked for adherence and conﬂuency under the microscope . Transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 3000 ( Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) . Brieﬂy , Lipofectamine 3000 reagent was diluted in Opti - Mem using the higher amount suggested by the manufacturer for 6 - well or 24 - well ( Ibidi dish ) and vortexed and spun down . About 5 µ g of plasmid DNA was diluted in Opti - MEM , and , subsequently , the 2 µ l of P3000 reagent per 1 µ g DNA was added to generate the master mix . The mastermix was spun down and mixed 1 : 1 with the prior diluted lipofectamine in Opti - Mem . The mixture was spun down and incubated for 30 min at room temperature . After the incubation , mixture was added to one well / dish drop by drop , and the cells were given an easy shake to mix the reagent better into their media . The cells were incubated at 37 ◦ C in an incubator . Transfection eﬃciency was controlled after 24 and 48h under a ﬂuorescent microscope . GFP Pulldown About 500 µ g of protein per condition was used to start the pull down . The Miltenyi µ M ACSGFP isolation kit ( 130 - 091 - 125 ) was used . About 50 µ g GFP beads were incubated with lysate , containing 500 µ g protein for 1h in the cold room with overhead shaking . A µ MACS column and magnet were placed in the cold room . About 200 µ l of an ice cold lysis buﬀer containing the proteinase inhibitor cocktail was used to preclear the columns . Whole lysate containing the beads was loaded on the magnetic column . Beads were washed two times with a wash buﬀer 1 [ 50 mM Tris ( pH = 7 . 5 ) , 150 - mM NaCl , 5 % glycerol , and 0 . 05 % Triton - X100 ] . Then , the beads were washed three times with wash buﬀer 2 [ 50 - mM Tris ( pH = 7 . 5 ) , 150 - mM NaCl ] . Elution was conducted via adding 20 µ l of a 95 ◦ C pre - heated elution buﬀer to the column and incubated at room temperature for 5min . Subsequently , 50 µ l was further eluted through the column , and analysis was done by Western Blot . For western blot detection after the GFP pull down , proteins were heat denatured in a mixture of sample - reducing agent 10 × ( NOVEX , NP0009 ) , and loading dye LDS Sample Buﬀer 4 × ( NOVEX , NP0007 ) was as well added to the protein . All amounts were calculated for a volume of 20 µ l and boiled at 70 ◦ C for 10min . Separation was performed on a precast NuPAGE 4 – 12 % Bis - Tris gel [ Invitrogen , ( WG1403BX10 ) with NuPAGE MOPS SDS Running Buﬀer ( NP0001 ) and immune blotted to a nitrocellulose membrane ( Transfer Pack , Midi format , 0 . 2 - µ m nitrocellulose , Bio - Rad , 170 - 4159 ) using a Trans Blot Turbo system ( Bio - Rad ) ] . Standard protein detection was FrontiersinNeuroscience 08 frontiersin . org Pancho et al . 10 . 3389 / fnins . 2022 . 887478 performed using mouse anti - GFP antibody - HRP ( 1 : 5 , 000 ; Biorad ) , rabbit anti - PCDH19 ( 1 : 500 Millipore ) . After 2 - h blocking in 5 % w / v non - fat dry milk / TBST ( a blocking buﬀer ) at RT , o / n incubation at 4 ◦ C in a primary antibody diluted in the blocking buﬀer , and washing in TBST , transfer membranes were incubated during 45min in HRP - conjugated anti - rabbit secondary antibodies ( Bio - Rad ) diluted 1 : 10 , 000 in a WB buﬀer . Protein bands were visualized with a ChemiDoc MP imaging system ( Bio - Rad ) after incubation in ECL substrate ( Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) . Flow cytometric analysis To perform our apoptosis analyses , we trypsinated the Neuro2A cells and stopped the enzyme with media - containing serum . In addition , we kept all the washes to not loose dead cells . After centrifugation , the supernatant was discarded , and cell pellets were resuspended in PBS and transferred into micro centrifuge tubes . In order to have a positive control for early and late apoptosis , the untransfected cell condition was used . Half of the cells were killed intentionally for 15 min at 75 ◦ C . These cells were then mixed with the rest of untransfected cells in equal parts and spun down . Once the positive apoptosis control was made , all the cell suspensions were spun down and resuspended into a 100 µ l Annexin V - binding buﬀer ( BD Biosciences ) . Annexin V ( V450 , 560506 BDBiosciences ) and 7 - aminoactinomycin D ( 7AAD ) ( 559925 BD Biosciences ) were added to analyze for early and late apoptosis , excluding the single - stain controls . The single - stain controls were the positive apoptosis control either incubated with Annexin V or 7AAD . Incubation was performed for 15 min at room temperature in the dark . After the incubation , an Annexin V - binding buﬀer was added , and cells were passed through tubes with a 35 - mm strainer ( VWR ) and analyzed with the SH800 Cell Sorter ( Sony ) . Image acquisition N2A cells images were acquired using the 60X magniﬁcation with oil immersion of the confocal microscope ( an Olympus FV1000 microscope ) and taking ﬂuorescent z - stacks with a depth of 1 – 2 µ m , a speed of 4 µ s / pix and a pixel size of at least 1024 × 1024 pixels . Whole z - depth of the DAPI - channel was covered . Quantiﬁcation of the nuclear - cytoplasmic ratio For nuclear - cytoplasmic distribution calculations , a single z - slice was manually selected from the provided z - stack in order to have the most central view of the cell through the nucleus and to have the highest number of cells in focus . These images were split in individual channels [ DAPI ( blue ) , GFP ( green ) and TexRed ( red ) ] . Images were segmented and analyzed using Cell Proﬁler using a custom - made pipeline . Brieﬂy , the cells were segmented by identifying individual nuclei through the DAPI channel using a global Otsu threshold method . Cells edges were identiﬁed using a propagation algorithm using the ﬂuorescence channel that would best describe the totality of the cell , leading to a one - to - one correspondence between each nucleus and the respective cell . Nuclear areas were deﬁned by the DAPI stain and the cytoplasmic areas were obtained by subtracting the nuclear areas to the identiﬁed total cell areas . Shrinking of 1 pixel of nuclei was used to better deﬁne the cytoplasmic areas . After segmentation , the average ﬂuorescence intensity was calculated for each cell in both the nucleus and cytoplasm - identiﬁed objects . Image analysis with CellProﬁler 2 . 2 . 0 and R Studio 3 . 6 . 1 was conducted by Marco Dalla Vecchia . Images with cells in a clearly dying state or with many saturated pixels were discarded from the analysis . Quantiﬁcation of the GFP - TdT ratio Z max projection was made of the explant images . The area of the explant was deﬁned by the Dlx5 / 6 - Cre - IRES - eGFP IN in the GFP channel . The same area was applied to the TdT channel , and the threshold was adjusted before measurement . Intensity measurements were performed with Fiji is just ImageJ and statistical analysis performed with Graph Pad Prism 8 . 3 . Results Pcdh19 mRNA and PCDH19 protein are produced in the ganglionic eminences during embryonic mouse brain development Diﬀerent studies have shown that Pcdh19 is expressed in the developing mouse cortex and hippocampus within pyramidal neurons ( Kim et al . , 2007 ; Fujitani et al . , 2017 ; Pederick et al . , 2018 ; Gerosa et al . , 2022 ) . Only a few groups have investigated Pcdh19 expression in inhibitory neurons ( Bassani et al . , 2018 ; Serratto et al . , 2020 ; Galindo - Riera et al . , 2021 ) . We hypothesized that proper migration of inhibitory neurons to the cortex could be aﬀected in PCDH19 - CE . To address this question , we ﬁrst assessed Pcdh19 expression in developing cortical interneurons neurons by means of in situ hybridization ( ISH ) . GABAergic cortical interneuron migration occurs from E12 - E19 in the developing mouse brain from the ganglionic eminence to the NCTX ( Guo and Anton , 2014 ) . We , therefore , studied Pcdh19 mRNA at E13 . 5 and E16 . 5 in the ganglionic eminence and NCTX in mouse embryonic brain slices ( Figures 1A – D ) . At E13 . 5 , Pcdh19 is clearly expressed in the cortical plate and the FrontiersinNeuroscience 09 frontiersin . org Pancho et al . 10 . 3389 / fnins . 2022 . 887478 ventricular zone within the NCTX , and in the mantle zone ( MZ ) , the dorsal lateral ganglionic eminence ( LGE ) ventricular zone ( VZ ) , and the lateral cortical stream ( LCS ) of the ventral telencephalon . Caudally , Pcdh19 mRNA could be detected throughout the CGE , thalamus ( TH ) , and hypothalamus ( HYP ) ( Figure 1B ) . At E16 . 5 , Pcdh19 expression became less prominent in the cortical plate ( CP ) than at E13 . 5 ( Figure 1C ) but appeared more restricted , which could be the prospective layer 5 , where Pcdh19 expression has been described postnatally ( Galindo - Riera et al . , 2021 ) ( Figure 1C ) . In the ventral telencephalon , it was still visible within the LCS . Caudally , expression was high in the limbic system within the TH , amygdala ( AM ) and HYP ( Figure 1D ) . To investigate the temporal dynamics of protein production of PCDH19 , we performed western blot ( WB ) on lysates of whole telencephalon at E13 . 5 , 15 . 5 , 17 . 5 , and P7 and quantiﬁed the relative amount of PCDH19 at each stage ( Figure 1E , Supplementary Figure 1A for WB ) . This analysis showed a signiﬁcant increase in PCDH19 production at late embryonic stages and at P7 , in line with the described roles of PCDH19 at the synapse . To further explore the expression of Pcdh19 in embryonic cortical interneurons , we made use of the Dlx5 / 6 - Cre - IRES - eGFP mouse line that labels migrating cortical interneurons during embryogenesis ( Stenman et al . , 2003 ) . We focused our analysis on E13 . 5 , given many assays in this manuscript use this time point , and interneuron migration is easy to visualize at this stage . We revealed Pcdh19 expression by hybridization chain reaction , which enables co - localization and semi - quantitative evaluation of expression in situ . The HCR signal appears dotty , and each dot represents at least one mRNA molecule . The number of dots can be used as a proxy for the expression level . This analysis conﬁrmed the colorimetric ISH data shown in Figures 1A , B , and indicated that some , but not all interneurons migrating through the cortex , expressed Pcdh19 ( Figures 1F , H , Supplementary Figure 1F ) . Pcdh19 was also expressed in the ventricular zone of the MGE , while it was nearly absent from the mantle zone ( Figure 1G ) . The marginal zone stream of interneurons tends to express Pcdh19 at a low level in most cells ( Figure 1I , Supplementary Figure 1G ) . We complemented this analysis with a study at the protein level , performing WB on lysates from the whole ventral telencephalon , telencephalon and distinct parts of the ganglionic eminence at E13 . 5 . A strong band around 126 kDa , which is the predicted MW of PCDH19 , indicated that PCDH19 was produced in the MGE , CGE , and LGE ( Figure 1J ) . Taken together , these results show that PCDH19 was present in the main regions that generate cortical inhibitory neurons at the assessed time points , and in variable levels in individual interneurons migrating in the cortex . To complement our analysis of endogenous PCDH19 production , we generated two mouse lines : a C - terminus - tagged PCDH19 - V5 mouse line , which would allow detection of PCDH19 with higher sensitivity , as the V5 antibody has been veriﬁed in more studies ; a PCDH19 KO mouse line , which served as a negative control for the HCR analysis ( Supplementary Figures 1B , C ) . The PCDH19 KO mouse line was designed to have a large deletion of 1 , 186 bp in the ﬁrst exon 1 . This deletion leads to a frameshift from AA176 onwards and a truncation of the protein at AA189 . We could not observe any HCR signal nor any protein production in this knockout model ( Supplementary Figures 1C , D ) , also not on any other height , ruling out alternative start exons that might generate a residual intracellular domain . Western Blot analysis of brain lysates showed the production of PCDH19 - V5 with a stronger band around 126 kDA at E13 . 5 , E14 . 5 , and postnatal Day ( P ) 7 ( Supplementary Figure 1E ) . The multiple bands at the full - length size could represent diﬀerent known PCDH19 mouse isoforms ( Hunt et al . , 2018 ) or post translational modiﬁcations . In the embryonic and P7 samples , but not in the adult brain , an additional band was detected at 50 kDA , the predicted MW of the PCDH19 intracellular domain . This fragment might have been generated by enzymatic cleavage , similar to some other PCDHs , as has been shown recently ( Pancho et al . , 2020 ; Gerosa et al . , 2022 ) . Besides a weak band around 70 kDa , no bands were observed in the wild - type control , showing the speciﬁcity of the V5 antibody . Our data thus suggested that , in the developing brain , PCDH19 appeared in diﬀerent forms , including a cleaved version . Distinct subdomains target PCDH19 to different subcellular localizations Cleavage of the ICD of transmembrane proteins is often followed by nuclear translocation , driven by a nuclear localization signal . We used distinct prediction tools to search for nuclear localization signals within the PCDH19 sequence ( Figure 2A ) . Three NLS sequences of the longest PCDH19 isoform ( Q80TF3 ) were predicted , yet scored diﬀerently in the prediction program NLStradamus ( Supplementary Figure 2A ) ( Nguyen Ba et al . , 2009 ) . To further study the subcellular localization of distinct PCDH19 subdomains , we generated C - terminally tagged overexpression constructs of subdomains of PCDH19 in bicistronic TdTomato expression plasmids ( pCAGGS - PCDH19 - eGFP - IRES - TdTomato ) : a full - length version : PCDH19FL ; extracellular and transmembrane domains : PCDH19ECDTM , an intracellular domain : PCDH19ICD and intracellular domains without a predicted nuclear localization signal ( NLS ) : PCDH19ICD 1 NLS ( Figure 2B ) . PCDH19ICD 1 NLS was lacking the predicted NLS with the highest score and analysis with NLStradamus showed loss of most nuclear localization activity ( Supplementary Figure 2A ) . The constructs were validated by expressing them in Neuro 2a cells ( Supplementary Figure 2C ) . Western Blot analysis indicated a proper production of the GFP - tagged FrontiersinNeuroscience 10 frontiersin . org Pancho et al . 10 . 3389 / fnins . 2022 . 887478 FIGURE2 PCDH19 subdomain constructs target expression to different subcellular locations .

Analysis of 72 - h post electroporation in Dlx5 / 6 - CRE - IRES - eGFP brain slices electroporated with bicistronic plasmids co - expressing a PCDH19 subdomain and TdTomato or only TdTomato in the empty bicistronic plasmid that was used as control . ( D ) After 72h in culture , IN migration to the cortical ﬁeld was determined by measuring the intensity of the TdT + neurons within the cortical ﬁeld divided by the intensity of the TdT + neurons spread over the whole brain slice . Upon PCDH19 ECD TM misexpression , signiﬁcant reduction in cortical IN migration to the cortical ﬁeld could be measured [ the Kruskal – Wallis multicomparison test with the Dunn’s post hoc test , * p = 0 . 0312 ( PCDH19 ECDTM ) and * p = 0 . 0122 ( PCDH19 FL ) ] . N number of replicates is indicated within the bars . domain mutants ( Supplementary Figure 2B ) . PCDH19 FL overexpression resulted in accumulation of tagged PCDH19 around the nuclear membrane . Overexpression of PCDH19ECDTM resulted in accumulation of PCDH19 at the membrane of the cell . PCDH19ICD localized to the nucleus , while PCDH19ICD 1 NLS could be found distributed over the whole cell and less prominent in the nucleus . Therefore , removing the NLS in this construct seems to inhibit nuclear translocation at least partially . Indeed , when we quantiﬁed the nuclear - cytoplasmic ratio ( Supplementary Figure 2D ) , we found that PCDH19ICD localized preferentially in the nucleus , while this preference was lost upon removal of the NLS . To investigate whether overexpression in the developing mouse forebrain yields similar results , we performed slice electroporation and visualized subcellular distribution of GFP - tagged PCDH19 . A similar subcellular distribution could be observed : PCDH19ECDTM was mainly found at the membrane . PCDH19FL was at the membrane , strongly again surrounding the nucleus but could also be identiﬁed in the nucleoli . PCDH19ICD localized to the nucleus while PCDH19ICD 1 NLS was distributed all over the cell ( Figure 2C ) . Taken together , our data show that PCDH19ICD translocated to the nucleus , probably using the predicted NLS . In addition , these constructs now allowed us to study the role of PCDH19 at the membrane and distinguish it from a potential role in the nucleus in diﬀerent mosaic overexpression paradigms . Cortical interneuron migration is decreased by gain - of - function of Pcdh19 As PCDH19 - CE only aﬀects women that display cellular mosaicism of PCDH19 , the imbalance in PCDH19 dosage at cell - cell contact sites might be a driver of the phenotype . We decided to model this mosaic imbalance by altering PCDH19 levels in some cells only by electroporation . In order to follow up the survival and quality of the slices , we used Dlx5 / 6 - Cre - IRES - eGFP organotypic brain slices in which proper interneuron migration of non - targeted cells was a proxy for healthy slices . A PCDH19 subdomain - expressing plasmid or the empty TdTomato control plasmid was electroporated in the MGE . This allowed us to study the eﬀect of overdosing distinct domains of PCDH19 on the migrational behavior of MGE cortical IN after 3 days in organotypic culture ( Figures 3A – C ) . Representative images of organotypic brain slices for the endogenous ﬂuorescence Dlx5 / 6ireseGFP ( Figure 3A ) and the electroporated ﬂuorescence TdTomato ( Figure 3B ) after 3DIV are shown for all conditions , and the cortical ﬁeld is depicted by the dotted line ( Figures 3A , B ) . Quantiﬁcation of the percentage of TdT positive neurons within the cortical ﬁeld compared to the whole brain slice showed signiﬁcantly reduced cortical IN migration for PCDH19ECDTM and PCDH19FL compared to the control condition ( Figure 3D , Kruskal – Wallis test with the Dunn’s post hoc test ) . Stunted neuronal morphology could be observed after PCDH19FL ( Figure 3B ) as well as after PCDH19 ECDTM overexpression , suggesting that increasing the PCDH19 extracellular amount could aﬀect cell morphology or survival . In contrast , increasing the dosage of the intracellular domain of PCDH19 did not impact IN migration nor morphology . As we hypothesized that an imbalance in PCDH19 dosage between migrating interneurons and their environment would inﬂuence migration , one could argue that non - targeted migrating interneurons might be aﬀected as well when neighboring , co - migrating interneurons would express an excessive amount of PCDH19 . We therefore investigated the migration of all eGFP - labeled neurons , and although we saw a reduction , this eﬀect was not signiﬁcant ( Supplementary Figure 3 , Kruskal – Wallis test ) , potentially because only a fraction of interneurons was targeted . Our data thus indicated that overdosing in especially the extracellular part of PCDH19 hampered tangential migration of interneurons to the neocortex . Pcdh19 gain - of - function affects migration distance and affects neuronal processes To further study the eﬀect of excess PCDH19 on neuronal migration and morphology , we investigated PCDH19 overexpressing neurons in cultured MGE explants . Interneurons generated from these explants migrate out over the course of hours , during which they detach from the explant and make plenty short - term contacts with migrating cells in their vicinity . Besides revealing the impact of PCDH19 gain - of - function on individual cells and their migration capacity , this FrontiersinNeuroscience 13 frontiersin . org Pancho et al . 10 . 3389 / fnins . 2022 . 887478 FIGURE4 Effects of overexpressing PCDH19 subdomains on MGE cell migration and morphology .

E13 . 5 Dlx5 / 6 - Cre - IRES - eGFP MGE explants were electroporated with the diﬀerent PCDH19 subdomain expressing and control constructs , allowing the detection of electroporated ( GFP + TdT + ) vs . non - electroporated ( GFP + TdT – ) cells ( Figure 4A ) . Next , we measured the total migration distance after 2DIV . Example images are shown for explant per experimental condition ( Figures 4B – F ) . Statistical analysis with the Kruskal – Wallis non - parametric test and the Dunn’s post hoc test showed a signiﬁcant reduction in the spread of PCDH19FL - expressing Ins compared to the TdT control condition ( p < 0 . 0001 ) ( Figure 4G ) . Binned distribution analysis indicated that PCDH19FL - overexpressing IN distribution is closer to the explant than the rest of the conditions ; nevertheless , no particular bin - speciﬁc means were found to be signiﬁcantly changed ( mixed - model ANOVA ) ( Figure 4H ) . Similarly , as in the brain slice , we asked whether we would see a non - cell autonomous eﬀect and , therefore , also analyzed non - targeted eGFP - positive neurons ( Supplementary Figure 4 ) . Also here , statistical analysis with the Kruskal – Wallis non - parametric test and the Dunn’s post hoc test displayed a signiﬁcant reduction in the spread of eGFP + TdT – neurons in the PCDH19FL condition ( p < 0 . 0001 ) compared to the TdT control , and , unexpectedly , a signiﬁcantly larger spread of the eGFP + TdT – neurons in the PCDH19ICD condition ( p < 0 . 0001 ) ( Supplementary Figure 4F ) . Statistical analysis per bin was also not signiﬁcant for the non - cell autonomous eﬀect of PCDH19 overexpression ( Supplementary Figure 4G ) . To further address the previous observation of the stunted neuronal morphology in the brain slices , we wondered whether upon overexpression of the diﬀerent subdomains neuronal morphology was aﬀected . Each neuron was assessed depending on the morphology of the leading process into “no process” , “unbranched process” , “single - branch process” , and into “multi - branch process” , and then the percentage of total neurons per experimental condition per explant was calculated per phenotype ( Figure 4I ) . Most neurons had an unbranched process ( 50 – 70 % ) , which ﬁts to the previous observed morphology in the explant assay ( Mitsogiannis et al . , 2021 ) . Overexpression of PCDH19FL compared to the control TdT - control did not result in any signiﬁcant observation . Since total migration distance was reduced upon PCDH19FL overexpression , we also decided to look into the topological morphological characteristics of the neuronal processes . Assessment of the total cable length , a measure for neurite outgrowth , resulted in signiﬁcant diﬀerences for PCDH19FL , PCDH19ECDTM , as well as PCDH19ICD 1 NLS , compared to the control condition ( Figure 4J , the Kruskal – Wallis non - parametric test , and the Dunn’s post hoc test ) . Primary branch length and average branch length were only signiﬁcantly aﬀected upon overexpression of PCDH19ECDTM compared to the control condition ( Figures 4K , L , the Kruskal – Wallis non parametric test , and the Dunn’s post hoc test ) . Thus , the observed reduced migration distance upon PCDH19FL overexpression cannot be explained only by an aﬀected neuronal morphology . Overexpressing the extracellular part of PCDH19 increases apoptosis The observed impact on cortical IN migration and total migration distance could not be explained by aberrant cell morphology of the electroporated neurons only . Therefore , we sought to investigate whether cell survival was aﬀected . First , we tested our hypothesis in the Neuro2A neuronal cell line . After 48h of transfection with the PCDH19 or control constructs , apoptosis was measured using ﬂow cytometry . AnnexinV was used to detect early apoptotic cells and 7AAD to detect late apoptotic cells within transfected and untransfected cells after overexpression . Flow cytometry example plots show transfected cells ( TdT + ) and early apoptotic cells ( Figure 5A , the upper row ) and late apoptotic cells ( Figure 5A , the bottom row ) . Quantiﬁcation of targeted cells results in more early and late FrontiersinNeuroscience 15 frontiersin . org Pancho et al . 10 . 3389 / fnins . 2022 . 887478 apoptotic cells upon PCDH19FL overexpression compared to the control condition ( Figure 5B , the left panel , Welch ANOVA , and the Dunnet’s post hoc test ) and in more late apoptotic cells upon PCDH19ECDTM and PCDH19FL compared to the control condition ( Figure 5B , the right panel , Welch ANOVA , and the Dunnet’s post hoc test ) . Quantiﬁcation of early and late apoptotic cells in the untargeted cells resulted in non - signiﬁcant diﬀerences , suggesting that the cells were not suﬀering because of the procedure , or that apoptosis was also induced by a non - cell - autonomous eﬀect ( Figure 5C , left and right panels ) . Therefore , the observed eﬀect is speciﬁc for the PCDH19 overexpressing cell population , but only when the extracellular domain is present . Next , we wondered whether we could address apoptosis in a more physiological model like the MGE explant . More cells can be targeted than in the slice electroporation with this approach , and , also , cellular resolution is better achieved with the assay than with the slice electroporation . We approximated the cell number of targeted cells via the TdT signal , again using the background of the Dlx5 / 6 - Cre - IRES - eGFP mouse line . We reasoned that , if overexpression would aﬀect cell viability and survival , we might lose more targeted cells and , hence , TdT expression , whereas overall GFP expression should stay constant . We measured the ratio between the TdT + and GFP + signals , whereby we normalized measurements by the explant area as shapes were diverse between measured conditions , and repeated the experiment several times to account for diﬀerences in electroporation eﬃciencies between experiments ( Figure 5D ) . Our data consistently showed signiﬁcantly lower ratios for PCDH19ECDTM and PCDH19FL compared to the control condition ( Figure 5E , the Kruskal – Wallis non parametric test , and the Dunn’s post hoc test ) , which could indicate that overexpression of these plasmids triggers neuronal loss . Taken together , our data suggest that an additional explanation for the observed impact on cortical interneuron migration could rely on increased neuronal cell death . Pcdh19 loss - of - function affects migration distance and polarity of MGE - derived interneurons yet does not affect neuronal processes Another way to model mosaic imbalance in PCDH19 dosage at cell - cell contact sites is to deplete PCDH19 levels in some cells only . We applied a CRISPR RNP electroporation approach to downregulate PCDH19 . Two guides targeting Exon 1 were designed ( P1 , P2 ) ( Supplementary Figure 5A ) and validated in vitro on a PCDH19FLeGFPiresTdT construct expressed in Neuro2A cells . Both guides were able to signiﬁcantly reduce the percentage of GFP - positive cells on the total number of transfected cells ( Supplementary Figures 5B , C ) . To address migration characteristics at the cellular level , we again used MGE tissue derived from Dlx5 / 6 - Cre - IRES - eGFP mice . Embryonic brains were injected and electroporated with ribonuclear particles containing a guide targeting Pcdh19 and Cas9 protein ( referred to as PCDH19KO RNPs ) or Cas9 protein alone ( control ) , and a TdT - expressing plasmid in the MGE at E13 . 5 . Subsequently , MGE pieces were cultured in Matrigel for 2 days ( DIV ) ( Figure 6A ) . At 2 DIV , total migration distance was measured from the edge to the neuronal soma ( Figure 6B ) . Figures 6C , D show representative examples of TdT - labeled neurons for each condition images . Migration distance was measured for more than 200 neurons in the PCDH19KO and control condition . Statistical comparison with the Mann – Whitney U test resulted in a slight signiﬁcant decrease ( p < 0 . 05 ) of total migration distance upon loss of function of Pcdh19 ( Figure 6E ) . Binned distribution analysis of the migration distance suggested that , in the PCDH19KO condition , more neurons are distributed closer to the explant ; however , no bin - speciﬁc means were found to signiﬁcantly diﬀer ( Multiple Mann – Whitney tests with FDR for multiple corrections ) ( Figure 6F ) . Also , for this analysis , we addressed the non - cell autonomous eﬀect of the PCDH19KO condition on eGFP + TdT – neurons and detected a signiﬁcant decrease ( p < 0 . 001 ) compared to the control condition ( the Mann – Whitney U test ) ( Supplementary Figure 6 ) . We further investigated whether the direction of migration could be aﬀected in the PCDH19KO - electroporated neurons . To this aim , we classiﬁed the leading neurite direction , showing away from the explant , toward the explant or when the direction could not be speciﬁed in both categories , parallel to the radial migration . The total amount of neurons within these three classiﬁcations was counted in 4 explants for each experimental condition . Statistical analysis indicated that more leading neurites were pointed toward the explant in the PCDH19KO condition ( two - way repeated measures ANOVA with Holm – Sidak post hoc comparison , p < 0 . 05 ) ( Figure 6G ) . Overall , about 70 % of the counted neurons pointed their main neurite away from the explant in both conditions . During interneuron migration , extension of the leading process is followed by branching as the neuron senses the environment , and , eventually , nucleokinesis . Microtubule and actin cytoskeleton remodeling events govern these dynamic processes ( Bellion et al . , 2005 ; Métin et al . , 2006 ; Guo and Anton , 2014 ) . A second reason for hampered migration could be disturbed by branch elongation and secondary branch formation . Hence , we measured primary branch length ( Figure 6H ) , average branch length ( Figure 6I ) , and cable length ( Figure 6J ) for more than 200 neurons in each condition , yielding no diﬀerence between the conditions . In addition , we also assessed cell survival in a similar manner as described above ( Figure 5D ) . Reducing the level of PCDH19 did not aﬀect cell survival ; we observed a lower number of targeted cells only in the control condition ; however , this diﬀerence remained FrontiersinNeuroscience 16 frontiersin . org Pancho et al . 10 . 3389 / fnins . 2022 . 887478 FIGURE5 PCDH19 ECD overexpression increases apoptosis in Neuro 2A - transfected cells and might induce apoptosis in MGE electroporated INs .

Collectively , these results indicated that , similar to PCDH19 overexpression , loss of PCDH19 in MGE - derived IN mildly reduced the total migration distance in MGE explants , which might be explained in part by a disturbed migration polarity . However , the cell - cell variation in the eﬀectiveness of the knockout , as well as the potential oﬀ - target eﬀects , was diﬃcult to measure in this explant model . Mild reduction in cortical interneuron migration in an in vivo model of PCDH19 - CE To further study the impact of PCDH19 imbalance and its impact on cortical interneuron migration , we modeled the mosaic loss by crossing the PCDH19 knockout mouse line heterozygotes with Dlx5 / 6 - Cre - IRES - eGFP mice in order to obtain control ( PCDH19 + / + ; Dlx5 / 6 - Cre - IRES - eGFP ) , heterozygotes ( PCDH19 + / – ; Dlx5 / 6 - Cre - IRES - eGFP ) , and PCDH19 KO ( PCDH19 – / – ; Dlx5 / 6 - Cre - IRES - eGFP ) mice in which VT - derived interneurons would be eGFP labeled . We studied the proportion of labeled cells in the cortex at E13 . 5 as a proxy for cell migration , similar to the analysis performed on the slices ( Figure 7A ) . In doing so , we found that , at this early stage , we could detect a mild but signiﬁcant reduction in migration in the heterozygote mice , but not in the homozygous KOs [ Figure 7B , ( ∗ p = 0 . 0135 , the Kruskal – Wallis test , and the Dunn’s post hoc test ) ] . These data suggest that , also , in vivo , creating an imbalance in the dosages of PCDH19 in interneurons and neurons hampers the overall interneuron migration to the cortex . Discussion This paper investigated the hypothesis that the early - onset epilepsy in females bearing a loss - of - function mutation on one allele of the PCDH19 gene might be linked to a developmental failure of pallial interneurons to properly migrate to the pallium . Our study shows presence of PCDH19 expression in the developing forebrain , including those regions generating pallial interneurons , and , in particular , demonstrated a temporally and spatially dynamic pattern . At the level of individual interneurons , we could detect variation in expression levels between cells , suggesting that diﬀerent cell types might depend on PCDH19 to a diﬀerent extent . This observation was done at the RNA level , so at this point , it is still unknown whether this translates to eﬀectively variable amounts of PCDH19 at the membrane level . The level of PCDH19 diﬀers between cells , regions , and time points , which suggests that expression of this gene is tightly regulated . Speciﬁc types of interneurons might thus be depending on PCDH19 at diﬀerent stages of their development . This corroborates the ﬁndings that PCDH19 has been implicated in neurogenesis ( Cooper et al . , 2015 ; Fujitani et al . , 2017 ; Homan et al . , 2018 ; Lv et al . , 2019 ) , neural sorting ( Pederick et al . , 2018 ) , and synaptogenesis and function ( Bassani et al . , 2018 ; Serratto et al . , 2020 ; Hoshina et al . , 2021 ; Mincheva - Tasheva et al . , 2021 ) . Our study focused on a , hitherto , less well - studied role in neural migration , taking the role of PCDH19 subdomains into account . We could not detect an increase in neuronal migration in our loss of function studies in contrast to the previous in vitro observation for cortical PCDH19KO neurons ( Pederick et al . , 2016 ) . This discrepancy might arise from the diversity of the assays , from the cell type investigated , as well as from the context of the experiment . Our analysis measured the total migration distance of PCDH19KO cortical interneurons that were still mixed with PCDH19 WT cortical interneurons , while Pederick et al . ( 2016 ) made their observation using full KO neurospheres . Our binning analysis together with the polarity assessment detected neurons migrating toward the explant , suggesting a disturbed migration polarity . Along the same line , ectopic positioning and orientation of PCDH19 loss of function hippocampal neurons have been detected in rats ( Bassani et al . , 2018 ) . In human iPSC progenitors , PCDH19 is found in a polarized manner at the apical membrane , suggesting a role in polarity ( Compagnucci et al . , 2015 ) . Whether PCDH19 loss aﬀects neuronal polarity and if these FrontiersinNeuroscience 19 frontiersin . org Pancho et al . 10 . 3389 / fnins . 2022 . 887478 FIGURE7 Cortical interneuron migration upon loss of PCDH19 in vivo .

( B ) Quantiﬁcation of GFP positive cells in the measured area shows average of GFP - positive cells percentage in the cortex per mouse genotype . Less migration to the cortex could be detected in the PCDH19 HET mouse compared to the control PCDH19 WT ( * p = 0 . 0135 ) , the Kruskal – Wallis test , and the Dunn’s post hoc test . could contribute to the phenotype of PCDH19 - CE remains to be investigated . Our data suggest that , in the developing mouse brain , PCDH19 is proteolytically processed , and the cytoplasmic fragment accumulates in the nucleus . Protein processing has been described for classical Cadherins ( Marambaud et al . , 2002 ; Maretzky et al . , 2005 ; Reiss et al . , 2005 ; Symowicz et al . , 2007 ; Jang et al . , 2011 ; Conant et al . , 2017 ) and , for other Protocadherins , such as PCDH12 ( Bouillot et al . , 2011 ) and the clustered α - and γ - PCDHs ( Junghans et al . , 2005 ; Reiss et al . , 2006 ; Buchanan et al . , 2010 ) . The released cytoplasmic fragment of Cadherins is bound by CREB - binding protein and diverged to the proteasome , suggesting that processing serves a role to remove the adhesive contact . The cytoplasmic fragment of PCDH γ C3 that is released travels to the nucleus and might exert a role there ( Haas et al . , 2005 ) . Recently , PCDH19 has been shown to be proteolytically processed in an activity - dependent manner in rat hippocampal cells and human iPSC - derived neurons , further conﬁrming our ﬁndings ( Gerosa et al . , 2022 ) . Upon overexpression of full - length PCDH19 in Neuro2A cells , the majority of the protein appeared in the cytoplasm and on the membrane , and not in the nucleus . This might suggest that either the necessary processing machinery is not present in Neuro2A cells , and / or additional conditions need to be fulﬁlled to elicit cleavage . In our ex vivo slice electroporation neurons , we did detect a signal in the nucleoli ; a similar localization was obtained in hippocampal neurons for PCDH19FL , and the cytoplasmic fragment of PCDH19 also localized to the nucleus in this study ( Pham et al . , 2017 ) . Our data indicate that proteolytic processing is also happening in vivo , during the embryonic period , which suggests that it might play a more general role , beyond the synaptic role suggested by activity - dependent processing in mature neuronal cultures . We applied diﬀerent overexpression and knockout paradigms to mimic the mosaic imbalance of the disease condition during embryonic forebrain development , and found that , in general , having an excessive amount of PCDH19 ( or facing absence of PCDH19 on neighboring cells ) leads to defects in migration . This seemed to originate from the extracellular domain , as overexpression of the intracellular domain had no such eﬀect , and was , at least , partly caused by enhanced apoptosis or reduced cell survival . We , therefore , hypothesize that having an excessive level of unbound PCDH19 at the membrane might trigger an apoptotic response . A similar concept has been described for dependence receptors ( Fombonne et al . , 2012 ; Genevois et al . , 2013 ; Causeret et al . , 2016 ) . These are a group of membrane proteins that need to be bound by a ligand in order for the cell to survive , or , conversely , when unbound , will trigger an apoptotic response ( Mehlen and Bredesen , 2004 ) . It remains to be investigated whether PCDH19 fulﬁlls the criteria of a dependence receptor ; whether it can be cleaved FrontiersinNeuroscience 20 frontiersin . org Pancho et al . 10 . 3389 / fnins . 2022 . 887478 by caspases and initiate apoptosis , or whether it acts indirectly by stabilizing a known dependence receptor at the membrane . Interesting is the ﬁnding that PCDH19 interacts with Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Non - Receptor Type 13 ( PTPN13 ) , a protein that prevents apoptosis when bound to NGFR , a known dependence receptor ( Emond et al . , 2020 ) . Stabilization of a dependence receptor also ﬁts with the observation that a truncated PCDH19 - ECD , which is unlikely to exert any cytoplasmic interactions , can trigger apoptosis upon overexpression as well . Other protocadherins have been linked to apoptosis in a diﬀerent manner . Deletion of the whole γ - PCDH - cluster leads to a very particular loss of interneurons , namely , cortical interneurons ( Carriere et al . , 2020 ; Mancia Leon et al . , 2020 ) . Along the same line , removing PCDH γ C4 from cortical or cerebellar interneurons results in signiﬁcant losses in interneuron cell number , caused by apoptosis , suggesting that this isoform sustains interneuron survival ( Garrett et al . , 2019 ; Mancia Leon et al . , 2020 ) . Although these functions seem to be contradictory to the idea of dependence receptors , they do link PCDHs to the process of apoptosis . We also refer to our recent review , describing the importance of PCDH dosage control for neuronal survival in the brain ( Pancho et al . , 2020 ) . The fact that diﬀerent PCDH19 domains induce opposite migration behaviors non - cell - autonomously is more diﬃcult to explain . On the other hand , it indicates that cell - cell interactions occuring in these explants might be diﬀerrentially aﬀected by extracellular or intracellular PCDH19 domains . The PCDH19 intracellular domain , which is translocated to the nucleus , might exert a nuclear role and change gene expression of immediate early genes ( IEGs ) as shown recently in hippocampal neurons ( Gerosa et al . , 2022 ) . These IEGs perhaps initiate a gene expression cascade that results in the secretion of a factor that stimulates cell migration . The reduced migration of non - targeted cells upon overexpression of PCDH19FL but not PCDH19 ECD might be caused by a potential binding partner at the cytoplasmic domain , such as Cdh2 ( N - Cad ) , which is a known a PCDH19 - binding partner ( Emond et al . , 2011 ) . During neurulation , both PCDH19 and Cdh2 need to be present to obtain directional and coherent migration of cells ( Biswas et al . , 2010 ) . Cdh2 has been shown to be important for interneuron migration speed , polarity , and postnatal survival ( Luccardini et al . , 2013 , 2015 ; László et al . , 2020 ) . Further research is needed to validate whether PCDH19FL overexpression increases the expression of Cdh2 at the surface and thus non - cell - autonomously might inﬂuence migration . For the moment , these remain speculations that need further experimental investigation ; however , the inﬂuence of PCDH19 - interacting partners is not to be neglected . Although we found a decrease in interneurons populating the PCDH19 heterozygous cortex at a very early time point , other mouse models of the disorder could not demonstrate a signiﬁcant cell loss in cortical interneurons at P20 or pyramidal neurons or a thinning of cortical layers at P10 ( Galindo - Riera et al . , 2021 ) . In these models , wild - type and PCDH19 knockout cells reorganize themselves into columns of cells with similar genotypes , resulting in a decrease of imbalanced cell - cell contacts ( Pederick et al . , 2018 ) . Combined with the cell - speciﬁc pattern of expression , a potentially hazardous imbalance situation might be avoided . On the other hand , the PCDH19 mosaicism might only delay the migration of interneurons , and the situation might be normalized at young postnatal stages . Future studies on the endogenous interaction partners of PCDH19 in the developing brain will hopefully aid in revealing the pathways involved in the dynamic action of this protein in neurogenesis , neural survival , diﬀerentiation , migration , and synaptic function and plasticity .
