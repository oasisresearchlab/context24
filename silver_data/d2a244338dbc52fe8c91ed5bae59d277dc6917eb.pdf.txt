HEMATOPOIESIS Signaling via Src Family Kinases Is Required for Normal Internalization of the Receptor c - Kit By Virginia C . Broudy , Nancy L . Lin , W . Conrad Liles , Seth J . Corey , Bridget O’Laughlin , Sherry Mou , and Diana Linnekin Stem cell factor ( SCF ) exerts its biological effects by binding to a specific receptor , the tyrosine kinase c - Kit , which is expressed on the cell surface . Although normal cellular trafficking of growth factor receptors may play a critical role in the modulation of receptor function , the mechanisms that regulate the distribution of c - Kit on the cell surface and the internalization of c - Kit have not been fully defined . We investigated whether signal transduction via Src family kinases is required for normal c - Kit trafficking . Treatment of the SCF - responsive human hematopoietic cell line MO7e with the inhibitor of Src family kinases PP1 blocked SCF - induced capping of c - Kit and internalization of c - Kit . c - Kit was able to associate with clathrin in the presence of PP1 , suggesting that entry of c - Kit into clathrin - coated pits occurs independently of Src family kinases . SCF - induced internaliza - tion of c - Kit was also diminished in the D33 - 3 lymphoid cell line in which expression of Lyn kinase was disrupted by homologous recombination . These results indicate that Src family kinases play a role in ligand - induced trafficking of c - Kit . r 1999byTheAmericanSocietyofHematology . S IGNAL TRANSDUCTION BY the receptor encoded by c - kit plays a critical role in hematopoiesis , in mast cell production and function , and in the development of germ cells and melanocytes ( reviewed in Broudy 1 ) . Binding of stem cell factor ( SCF ) to c - Kit induces homodimerization and intermo - lecular tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor , creating dock - ing sites for a number of SH2 - containing signal transduction molecules . 2 These include phosphatidylinositol 3 8 - kinase ( PI 3K ) and phospholipase C g - 1 , 3 - 5 Stat1 , 6 the Src family kinases Src , Lyn , and Fyn , 7 - 9 and the GTPase activating protein GAP . 10 Binding of SCF to c - Kit results in activation of Protein Kinase C , 5 , 11 Rac1 , 9 JNK , 9 Raf - 1 , 12 tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 , 13 and association of the adaptor protein CRKL and of p120 cbl . 14 An SH2 domain - containing tyrosine phosphatase , SHP - 1 , asso - ciates with a tyrosine in the juxtamembrane region of c - Kit , and downmodulates c - Kit signal transduction . 15 , 16 Like other cell surface hematopoietic growth factor recep - tors , c - Kit is rapidly internalized after ligand binding . 17 - 20 Internalization of the cytokine - receptor complex may be a mechanism to attenuate cellular response to the ligand . 21 , 22 Additionally , internalization and normal cellular trafficking of the receptor may be necessary for activation of the full spectrum of signal transduction pathways associated with the receptor . 23 For these reasons , the mechanisms that regulate endocytosis of cell surface receptors have been intensely studied . 24 , 25 Clathrin - coated pits constitute a major mechanism of endocy - tosis of cell surface proteins . Speciﬁc sequences in the cytoplas - mic tail of cell surface proteins mediate association with the adaptor complex AP - 2 , which targets the cell surface protein to clathrin - coated pits . 26 The GTPase dynamin assembles into high molecular weight multimers at the neck of the clathrin - coated pit , 27 and mediates scission of the clathrin - coated pit from the plasma membrane . 28 , 29 The contents of the vesicle can then be transported to the lysosome for degradation , or recycled to the cell surface . Prior studies of c - Kit internalization have shown the require - ment for c - Kit kinase activity , PI 3K activation , and calcium inﬂux for rapid receptor internalization . Introduction of a point mutation at aspartic acid 790 in the kinase domain of c - Kit ablated kinase activity , and diminished the rate of SCF - stimulated receptor internalization . 18 In contrast , introduction of a point mutation at tyrosine 719 in the kinase insert region , the binding site of the p85 subunit of PI 3K , did not impair c - Kit internalization , 18 , 19 but disrupted normal intracellular trafficking of the receptor . However , when both calcium inﬂux and PI 3K activation were prevented , the cells failed to internalize the receptor . 19 Mutation of a c - Kit autophosphorylation site at tyrosine 821 did not ablate ligand - induced receptor internaliza - tion . 18 These studies did not examine the role of Src family kinases in c - Kit internalization . Because Src family kinases ( reviewed in Corey and Ander - son 30 ) associate with c - Kit in normal hematopoietic cells and in hematopoietic cell lines , 8 , 9 and because overexpression of Src in ﬁbroblasts increases the rate of internalization of the ligand - occupied epidermal growth factor receptor , 31 we investigated From the Divisions of Hematology and Allergy and Infectious Disease , Department of Medicine , University of Washington , Seattle , WA ; the Division of Hematology - Oncology , Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh , Pittsburgh , PA ; the Intramural Research and Support Program , SAIC Frederick , National Cancer Institute - Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center , Frederick , MD ; and the Laboratory of Leukocyte Biology , Division of Basic Sciences , National Cancer Institute - Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center , Freder - ick , MD .

We focused on the ability of c - Kit to cap , to enter clathrin - coated pits , and to be internalized . The results show that lack of Src family kinase activity inhibits SCF - induced c - Kit trafficking . MATERIALS AND METHODS Cells and reagents . The SCF - responsive human leukemic cell line MO7e was maintained in Iscove’s modiﬁed Dulbecco’s medium ( IMDM ; GIBCO , Grand Island , NY ) supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum ( FCS ; Hyclone , Logan , UT ) plus 3 ng / mL recombinant human granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor ( GM - CSF ) ( ob - tained from Dr Kenneth Kaushansky , University of Washington , Seattle , WA ) . The DT40 chicken B - cell line and the D33 - 3 Lyn - deﬁcient cell line ( a subclone of DT40 generated by targeted disruption of Lyn ) 32 were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2 mmol / L glutamine , 50 µmol / L b - mercaptoethanol , 10 % FCS , and 1 % chicken serum ( Sigma Chemical Co , St Louis , MO ) . Recombinant human SCF 1 - 165 , expressed in Escherichia coli , was obtained from Amgen , Inc ( Thousand Oaks , CA ) . The inhibitor of Src family kinases PP1 33 was obtained from Calbiochem ( La Jolla , CA ) . The non - neutralizing anti – c - Kit monoclonal antibody ( MoAb ) 104D2 34 was a gift from Dr Hans - Jo¨rg Bu¨hring ( University of Tu¨bingen , Tu¨bingen , Germany ) . The SR - 1 anti – c - Kit antibody was generated in our laboratory . 35 The anticlathrin heavy chain MoAb and the antidynamin II MoAb were obtained from Transduction Labs ( Lexington , KY ) . Polyclonal antibody used to immunoprecipitate Lyn was kindly provided by Dr Joe Bolen ( DNAX , Palo Alto , CA ) and has previously been described . 36 MoAb used to identify Lyn by immunoblotting was purchased from Transduc - tion Labs . Flow cytometric analysis of c - Kit internalization . The MO7e cells were incubated in the absence or presence of PP1 ( 10 µmol / L ) for 30 minutes at 37°C , before the addition of SCF ( 200 ng / mL ) . Aliquots of cells were removed at various time points ( 0 to 60 minutes ) , ﬁxed in 0 . 5 % paraformaldehyde , labeled with the 104D2 antibody ( 2 µg / mL ) followed by goat antimouse immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) - PE ( Jackson ImmunoResearch , West Grove , PA ) , and analyzed in a Coulter Epics Elite ﬂow cytometer ( Coulter , Miami , FL ) to detect cell surface c - Kit . Expression and internalization of c - Kit in the DT40 cell line and in the lyn - deﬁcient D33 - 3 cell line . The DT40 cell line and the D33 - 3 Lyn - deﬁcient cell line were electroporated with the pTracer / CMV2 vector ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) containing the full - length human c - kit complementary DNA ( cDNA ) using techniques previously de - scribed . 37 Stable transfectants were selected by culture in zeocin ( 200 µg / mL ; Invitrogen ) . For some experiments , the cells were labeled with the SR - 1 anti – c - Kit MoAb , followed by goat antimouse IgG - PE , and the 2 % of cells expressing the highest quantity of cell surface c - Kit were selected by cell sorting in a Coulter Epics Elite ﬂow cytometer , and subsequently maintained in RPMI 1640 in the presence of 2 mmol / L glutamine , 50 µmol / L b - mercaptoethanol , 10 % FCS , 1 % chicken serum , and 200 µg / mL zeocin . The cells were incubated without or with SCF ( 200 ng / mL ) for 60 minutes at 37°C , then analyzed for c - Kit internalization by ﬂow cytometry as described above , with the follow - ing modiﬁcation . Aliquots of the DT40 - c - Kit cells and the D33 - 3 - c - Kit cells were labeled with puriﬁed mouse IgG1 ( Southern Biotechnology Associates , Birmingham , AL ) in parallel to labeling with the 104D2 antibody , and the mean ﬂuorescence intensity of cells labeled with the control mouse IgG1 was subtracted from the mean ﬂuorescence intensity of cells labeled with the 104D2 antibody . Because sorted and unsorted cells gave similar results , all of the experiments were analyzed together . Immunoprecipitation , electrophoresis , and immunoblotting . Immu - noprecipitations were performed with the antibodies indicated . The immune complexes were resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS - PAGE ) and transferred to Immobilon as previously described . 8 In brief , the blots were blocked and incubated with the unconjugated primary antibody indicated . After rigorous washing , the blots were incubated ﬁrst with biotinylated secondary antibody ( rabbit or mouse , as appropriate ) , then with peroxidase - conjugated streptavidin . Proteins were visualized using the Renaissance Reagent for enhanced chemiluminescence ( New England Nuclear , Boston MA ) . Immune complex kinase assay . The cells were washed twice in RPMI 1640 and lysed in 1 mL of buffer containing 1 % Triton X - 100 , 150 mmol / L sodium chloride , 20 mmol / L Tris , 10 mmol / L EDTA , 100 µmol / Lsodium ﬂuoride , 1 mmol / LMgCl 2 , 2 mmol / Lsodium orthovana - date , 10 % glycerol , 200 µg / mL aprotinin , 10 µg / mL leupeptin , 10 µmol / L pepstatin , and 1 mmol / L PMSF . Lyn kinase assays were performed as follows . Clariﬁed cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti - Lyn polyclonal antibodies , washed six times with lysis buffer , then incubated 15 minutes at 30°C in kinase buffer ( 25 mmol / L Hepes and 10 mmol / L MnCl 2 , pH 7 . 5 ) containing 100 µCi / mL [ g - 32 P ] ATP . Samples were then washed and eluted from the proteinAsepharose with SDS sample buffer . c - Kit kinase assays were performed as described above except that a MoAb speciﬁc for c - Kit ( SR - 1 ) was used for the immunoprecipitations . Radiolabeled proteins were resolved with SDS - PAGE , transferred to Immobilon , and visualized with autoradiography . Protein loading was assessed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies as described above . Localization of c - Kit by immunoﬂuorescence microscopy . Fluores - cence microscopy was used to examine the cell surface distribution of c - Kit , and to provide an alternative way to evaluate cell surface versus internalized receptor . The MO7e cells were incubated overnight in 1 % FCS and 1 ng / mL GM - CSF to minimize exposure to SCF present in serum , 38 then incubated without or with PP1 ( 10 µmol / L ) for 30 minutes at 37°C . The cells were labeled with the 104D2 antibody ( 5 µg / mL ) for 30 minutes at 4°C , then SCF ( 200 ng / mL ) or no SCF was added , the cells were incubated at 37°C , and aliquots of cells were removed at time 0 , 3 minutes , or 30 minutes for analysis . The cells were ﬁxed in 0 . 5 % paraformaldehyde and one half of each aliquot of cells was permeabi - lized with 0 . 05 % Triton X - 100 to permit detection of intracellular c - Kit . 39 All of the samples were incubated with goat antimouse IgG - ﬂuorescein isocyanate ( FITC ) , and with propidium iodide ( 0 . 5 µg / mL ; Molecular Probes , Inc , Eugene , OR ) to stain the nuclei . The cells were analyzed and photographed in a Nikon Eclipse E800 Fluorescent Microscope ( Tokyo , Japan ) , using a 60 3 0 . 95 Nikon dry objective lens and ﬁlters to detect FITC ﬂuorescence at 515 to 555 nm , and propidium iodide ﬂuorescence above 590 nm . Caps were deﬁned as an intensely ﬂuorescent area of the cell surface encompassing less than 1 / 4 of the cell circumference . Analysis of MO7e migration . SCF - induced chemotaxis of MO7e cells was assessed by a ﬂuorescence - based assay using 96 - well chemotaxis chambers containing polycarbonate ﬁlters with 8 µm pores ( ChemoTx , Neuro Probe Inc , Gaithersburg , MD ) . MO7e cells ( 5 3 10 6 / mL ) in RPMI 1640 containing 10 % FCS were incubated for 45 minutes at 37°C with 5 µg / mL calcein AM ( Molecular Probes ) , then washed twice with RPMI 1640 containing 0 . 1 % human serum albumin ( Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) ( RPMI - HSA ) and resuspended at 4 3 10 6 cells / mL in RPMI - HSA for the assay . The chamber wells were ﬁlled with 29 µL of varying concentrations of SCF ( 1 ng / mL to 1 µg / mL ) diluted in RPMI - HSA , or with RPMI - HSA alone as a negative control . The ﬁlter was applied , and MO7e cells ( 25 µL containing 1 3 10 5 cells ) were placed directly onto the ﬁlters . All conditions were performed in quadruplicate in each experiment . The chambers were incubated for 4 hours at 37°C in the SCF dose - response studies , and for up to 6 hours in the time - course experiments . To assess the potential role of Src family kinases in SCF - mediated chemotaxis , MO7e cells were preincubated for 30 minutes at 37°C with PP1 ( 10 µmol / L ) . At the end of the incubation period , nonmigrating cells on the origin ( top ) side of the 1980 BROUDY ET AL For personal use only . on October 31 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From ﬁlter were removed by washing and aspirating with excess RPMI - HSA and gentle wiping with a tissue . To determine the percentage of cells that migrated into the bottom chamber during the course of the experiment , the chemotaxis chamber was placed in a multiwell ﬂuorescent plate reader ( Cyto Fluor II , PerSeptive Biosystems , Framing - ham , MA ) and ﬂuorescence was determined in the bottom - read position ( excitation 485 nm , emission 530 nm ) . The data are reported as the percentage of MO7e cells ( mean 6 SD ) that migrated into the bottom chamber during the course of the experiment . RESULTS To examine the role of Src family members in the early events in SCF - induced c - Kit internalization we used PP1 , a Src family inhibitor . 33 Because Lyn is the most highly expressed Src family member in MO7e cells and is also associated with c - Kit , we chose to examine the effects of PP1 on Lyn kinase activity . 8 Figure 1A shows that PP1 dramatically inhibited Lyn autophos - phorylation activity , whereas no differences in the expression of the Lyn protein were found ( Fig 1B ) . Importantly , PP1 has no effect on the catalytic activity ( Fig 1C ) or the protein expression ( Fig 1D ) of c - Kit . Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that treat - ment with SCF induces rapid capping of c - Kit before internal - ization . 39 We therefore examined the effect of PP1 on SCF - induced capping of c - Kit using immunoﬂuorescence microscopy . In the absence of PP1 , a 3 - minute exposure to SCF resulted in dramatic changes in the distribution of the receptor on the cell surface . The diffuse pattern of cell surface c - Kit display ( Fig 2A ) changed to a large cap in one region of the cell , plus multiple punctate clusters ( Fig 2B , Table 1 ) . In MO7e cells pretreated with PP1 and then exposed to SCF for 3 minutes , the caps were not observed , and the location of c - Kit in the multiple punctate clusters was more pronounced ( Table 1 , Fig 2D ) . These data show that PP1 impairs SCF - induced capping of c - Kit and suggest a role for Src family activity in redistribution of c - Kit on the cell surface . In addition , one explanation for the punctate staining pattern of c - Kit in Fig 2 is association with clathrin - coated pits . To determine if Src family kinase activity is necessary for incorporation of c - Kit into clathrin - coated pits , we examined the effect of PP1 on the capacity of the receptor to coimmuno - precipitate with clathrin after stimulation with SCF ( Fig 3 ) . These experiments show that a 5 - minute treatment with SCF induced association of c - Kit and clathrin . In contrast , c - Kit and clathrin were associated in MO7e cells treated with PP1 both before and after stimulation with SCF . These data show that Src family kinase activity is not necessary for entry of c - Kit into clathrin - coated pits . The constitutive association of c - Kit and clathrin after PP1 treatment suggests that there is normally a basal level of c - Kit internalization via clathrin - coated pits , and that when internalization is blocked , c - Kit accumulates in the clathrin - coated pits . Assembly of receptors in clathrin - coated pits is rapidly followed by scission from the cell surface and traffick - ing through endocytic organelles . Consistent with prior reports , 17 - 20 , 39 we found that SCF induces internalization of c - Kit ( Fig 4 ) . However , SCF - induced internalization of c - Kit is blocked in MO7e cells pretreated with PP1 ( Fig 4 ) . To investigate whether Lyn kinase has a role in SCF - induced c - Kit internalization , we introduced c - Kit into the DT40 lymphoid cell line that expresses Lyn kinase , and into the D33 - 3 subclone that lacks Lyn kinase due to targeted disruption of Lyn . 32 The DT40 - c - Kit cells and the D33 - 3 - c - Kit cells were incubated in the presence of SCF for 60 minutes , and cell surface display of c - Kit was assessed by ﬂow cytometry ( Fig 5 ) . In a total of six experiments , the Lyn - deﬁcient D33 - 3 cells internalized 51 . 2 6 9 . 8 % as much cell surface c - Kit as the parental DT40 cell line ( mean 6 SEM of 6 experiments ) . In addition , we expressed a kinase - inactive form of Lyn ( Lyn K275R ) 37 in MO7e cells . Expression of Lyn K275R resulted in reduction of SCF - induced internalization of c - Kit , in compari - son with MO7e cells transfected with the vector alone ( data not shown ) . We used immunoﬂuorescence microscopy to examine the cellular localization of the receptor after treatment of MO7e cells with SCF . In the absence of PP1 , treatment with SCF for Fig 1 . PP1 inhibits Lyn kinase activity but not c - Kit kinase activity in MO7e cells . MO7e cells were treated for 30 minutes at 37°C in the presence or absence of PP1 ( 10 m mol / L ) . The cells were then lysed and assessed for either Lyn or c - Kit activity as described in the Materials and Methods section . ( A ) Lyn kinase activity is inhibited after treatment with PP1 .

Before exposure to SCF ( A , C ) , or after a 3 - minute exposure to SCF ( 200 ng / mL ; B , D ) , the cells were fixed andlabeledwithgoatantimouseIgG - FITC plus propidium iodide , and photographed at a magnifi - cation of 60 3 . Fig 6 . c - Kit remains on the surface of PP1 - treated cells . MO7e cells were preincubated without PP1 ( A , B ) or with PP1 ( C , D ) as described in Fig 1 , then labeled with the 104D2 antibody . After a 30 - minute incubation in SCF ( 200 ng / mL ) , the cells were fixed and labeled with goat anti - mouse IgG - FITC under condi - tions to detect cell surface c - Kit ( A , C ) , or cell surface plus cyto - plasmic c - Kit ( B , D ) , as described in Materials and Methods . 1982 BROUDY ET AL For personal use only . on October 31 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From 30 minutes resulted in loss of c - Kit expression on the surface of MO7e cells ( Fig 6A ) , and appearance of c - Kit in the intracellu - lar compartment ( Fig 6B ) . In contrast , 30 minutes after the addition of SCF to PP1 - treated MO7e cells , c - Kit remains distributed in a punctate pattern on the cell surface ( Fig 6C ) , consistent with imprisonment in clathrin - coated pits . Permeabi - lization of the PP1 - treated MO7e cells to permit detection of cell surface plus cytoplasmic c - Kit ( Fig 6D ) was similar to results shown in Fig 6C , indicating that no additional c - Kit is detected intracellularly in the PP1 - treated cells . In total , these data show that lack of Src family kinase activity impairs internalization of c - Kit in response to SCF , and suggest a role for Src family members in these events . Because the formation of caps in one region of the cell may be involved in cell locomotion , 40 and because SCF is a potent chemotactic agent for hematopoietic cells and for mast cells , 41 - 43 we investigated whether Src family kinase activity is required for SCF - induced migration of MO7e cells . The ability of SCF to induce chemotaxis of MO7e cells was assessed in a ﬂuorescence - based assay using 96 - well chemotaxis chamber plates ( Fig 7 ) . SCF - induced migration of MO7e cells was evident within 30 minutes and maximal by 4 hours , at which time 21 . 5 % 6 2 . 0 % ( mean 6 standard deviation ) of the MO7e population was observed to migrate ( Fig 7A ) . Optimal MO7e migration oc - curred at 100 ng / mL SCF , and preincubation with PP1 ( 10 µmol / L ) reduced migration induced by SCF ( 100 ng / mL ) by greater than 80 % ( Fig 7B ) . DISCUSSION One of the major mechanisms of endocytosis of cell surface receptors is via clathrin - coated pits , although alternative mecha - nisms of endocytosis have also been described . 24 , 44 Recruitment of receptors into clathrin - coated pits depends on association of Fig 3 . PP1 does not impair SCF - induced association of c - Kit with clathrin . MO7e cells were incubated without or with PP1 as described in Fig 1 , then treated without or with SCF for 5 minutes . The cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with the SR - 1 anti – c - Kit anti - body , andanalyzedbySDS - PAGEfollowedbyimmunoblottingwitha polyclonal antibody specific for the clathrin heavy chain ( A ) , or immunoblotting with a polyclonal antibody specific for c - Kit ( B ) . Fig 4 . PP1 inhibits SCF - induced internalization of c - Kit . MO7e cells were preincubated without PP1 ( s ) or with PP1 ( s ) for 30 minutes at 37°C , then SCF ( 200 ng / mL ) was added . Aliquots of cells were removed at time 0 , 3 , 15 , and 60 minutes after the addition of SCF , fixed in 0 . 5 % paraformaldehyde , labeled with the anti – c - Kit MoAb 104D2 , followed by PE - conjugated goat antimouse IgG , and analyzed by flow cytometry . The MO7e cells incubated in the absence of PP1 exhibited a PE mean fluorescence intensity at time 0 identical to that of the MO7e cells incubated in the presence of PP1 . One additional experiment gave similar results . Fig 5 . Internalization of c - Kit is impaired in Lyn - deficient cells . The DT40 - c - Kit and the Lyn - deficient D33 - 3 - c - Kit cells were incubated in SCF ( 200 ng / mL ) for 1 hour at 37°C , and analyzed for c - Kit internaliza - tion by flow cytometry as described in Fig 4 . The results of one of six similar experiments is shown . Table 1 .

TRAFFICKING OF c - KIT 1983 For personal use only . on October 31 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From speciﬁc sequences in the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor with the AP - 2 complex , which is followed by association with clathrin . Coimmunoprecipitation of c - Kit and clathrin has been shown ( Gommerman et al 19 and the present report ) , implying that c - Kit can be internalized via the clathrin - coated pit mechanism . We found that signal transduction by Src family kinases is not required for entry of c - Kit into clathrin - coated pits . However , internalization of c - Kit was impaired in the PP1 - treated MO7e cells and in the Lyn - deﬁcient D33 - 3 cells , suggesting that Src family kinases are involved in this process . Clathrin - coated pits have been estimated to comprise 2 % of the cell surface area , and to have a half - life on the cell surface of 1 to 2 minutes . 45 One question is whether activated signaling receptors enter preexisting clathrin - coated pits , or initiate assembly of new clathrin - coated pits that then internalize the ligand - receptor complex . The high - affinity Fc receptor for IgE can be sequestered in preexisting clathrin - coated pits ; activation of this receptor did not induce new clathrin - coated pit forma - tion . 46 However , epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) binding to the EGF receptor promotes clathrin redistribution to the cell periphery , and this process is mediated at least in part by phosphorylation of clathrin heavy chain by Src . 47 The latter data clearly show a role for Src family kinases in the regulation of clathrin localization and function . Of note , although phosphory - lation of clathrin occured within 2 minutes of EGF binding , recruitment of clathrin to the cell periphery was detected 10 to 20 minutes after EGF binding . 47 Coimmunoprecipitation of c - Kit and clathrin can be detected within 2 to 5 minutes after exposure of cells to SCF ( Gommerman et al 19 and the present report ) , and the association of c - Kit and clathrin does not require Src family kinase activity . These results suggest that although Src can directly phosphorylate clathrin , 47 neither Src family kinase - induced phosphorylation of clathrin nor clathrin redistribution to the cell periphery is necessary for initial entry of ligand - activated c - Kit into clathrin - coated pits . Scission of clathrin - coated pits from the cell surface requires the participation of the GTPase dynamin . Dynamin contains an aminoterminal GTP binding domain , a pleckstrin homology motif , and a carboxy - terminal proline - rich region , which con - tains binding sites for SH3 - containing proteins . Dynamin can bind members of the Src kinase family , 48 - 50 including Lyn , 51 and Src family members stimulate the GTPase activity of dynamin in vitro . 48 Deletion mutagenesis of SH3 binding sites in the proline - rich region of dynamin impairs dynamin colocalization with clathrin in the plasma membrane , self assembly , and GTPase activity . 51 - 53 Furthermore , ligand - induced activation of the b 2 - adrenergic receptor induces Src to associate with dyna - min and to phosphorylate dynamin , 50 which is essential for its function in the internalization of the b 2 - adrenergic receptor . Together , these data implicate Src family kinases in the regulation of dynamin function . The diminished ability of the PP1 - treated MO7e cells or the Lyn - deﬁcient D33 - 3 cells to internalize c - Kit is consistent with these results , 50 and may be due to a requirement for Src family kinase activity for normal dynamin function . Capping of receptors in one region of the cell surface may serve as a mechanism to facilitate the association of the receptor and critical signal transduction molecules in a macromolecular complex . 54 Clustering and lateral signaling among receptors may amplify a ligand binding signal in prokaryotic cells , 55 and possibly in eukaryotic cells as well . 56 Previous work has shown that expression of a mutant c - Kit lacking a Src family binding site , 9 or treatment of cells with PP1 , 8 , 9 inhibits SCF - induced proliferation . It is possible that inhibition of c - Kit capping or other receptor trafficking events may play a role in the ability of PP1 to impair SCF - induced proliferation . Cap formation is found in motile cells , and may be required for cell migration . 40 Because treatment with PP1 inhibited SCF - induced capping of c - Kit , we investigated whether SCF - induced migration of the cells would also be impaired . These experiments showed that inhibition of Src family kinase activity Fig 7 . SCF induces chemotaxis of MO7e cells via a Src family kinase - mediated mechanism . SCF - induced chemotaxis was mea - sured by a fluorescence - based assay using 96 - well chemotaxis cham - ber plates ( see Materials and Methods ) . Panel A depicts time - course analysis of SCF - induced ( 100 ng / mL ) migration of MO7e cells . Panel B shows the concentration dependence of SCF - induced chemotaxis and PP1 ( 10 m mol / L ) inhibition of SCF - induced chemotaxis of MO7e cells . The data are reported as the percentage of MO7e cells migrat - ing into the lower chamber ( mean 6 standard deviation ) . The results are representative of three independent experiments that yielded similar results . The percentage of cells migrating in the presence of SCF plus PP1 was not different than the percentage of cells migrating in the control ( P G . 05 , Student’st - test ) . 1984 BROUDY ET AL For personal use only . on October 31 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From diminished SCF - induced chemotaxis of MO7e cells ( Fig 7 ) . In contrast to the present results with c - Kit , phosphorylation of the PDGF b - receptor by Src negatively regulates PDGF BB - induced mobility of endothelial cells . 57 Inhibition of Src family kinase activity by overexpression of low molecular weight phosphotyrosine - protein phosphatase enhanced PDGF BB - stimulated chemotaxis of NIH 3T3 cells . 58 However , activation of Src family kinases is not required for PDGF BB - induced endothelial cell chemotaxis mediated by the PDGF a - recep - tor . 59 Thus Src family kinases may play distinct roles in cell migration mediated by different members of the Type - III tyrosine kinase receptor family .
