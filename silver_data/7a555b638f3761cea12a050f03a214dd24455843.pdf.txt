Thus , a drug - screening system which more closely mimics the microenvironment of in vivo tumors is neces - sary . Here , we present a biomimicking bilayer micro ﬂ uidic device that can facilitate antitumor drug screening . The micro ﬂ uidic device consists of two polydimethylsiloxane ( PDMS ) pieces with channels which are separated by a semipermeable membrane to allow water , oxygen , and nutrition supply , while preventing cell migration . The channels embedded on the two PDMS pieces overlap each other over a long distance to ensure a larger exchange area to mimic the blood vessel - tumor model . High concentrations of endothelial cells ( EC ) are ﬁ rst seeded onto the membrane through the apical channel , and after a two - day culture , a con ﬂ uent EC monolayer forms . Tumor spheroid - laden Matrigel is then seeded into the basal channel . After the Matrigel is cured , the device is ready for drug testing . Paclitaxel is used as the model drug for testing . Confocal microscopy and ImageJ are used to assess the e ﬃ cacy of di ﬀ erent concentrations of paclitaxel , and optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) is employed to determine the tumor volumetric change after the drug treatment . The results indicate that the proposed bilayer micro ﬂ - uidic device in combination with confocal and OCT optical characterization provide an e ﬃ cient platform for antitumor drug testing .

Although this model is easy - to - use , suitable for automation , and is useful for High Throughput Screening ( HTS ) systems , 1 – 3 using 2D tumor cell monolayers for drug - screening purposes is not a realistic recreation of tumors in an in vivo environment . This is because 2D cell culture does not mimic the essential cell - cell or cell - extracellular matrix ( ECM ) interactions present in vivo , which presents a crucial limitation for accurately estimating the e ﬃ cacy of a tumor drug in the human body . There is overwhelming evidence that in vitro three - dimensional ( 3D ) tumor cell cultures more accurately re ﬂ ect the complex in vivo microenvironment than simple 2D cell monolayers , with respect to gene expression pro ﬁ les , signaling pathway activity , and drug sensitivity . 4 – 7 For example , some tumor cell lines developed dense multicellular spheroids in 3D - culture and showed greater resis - tance to paclitaxel and doxorubicin as compared to the 2D - cultured cells . 8 – 14 Therefore , utilization of 3D tumor models increases the accuracy of tumor drug - screening results . Most of the 3D cellular models are focused on 3D spheroids , due to the ease of formation and enhanced manipulation . 15 – 17 Of the 3D spheroid models , tumor spheroid models are the most successful and widely applied research tools for cancer studies and drug screening . 18 – 21 Studies have been performed to make the mor - phology and physiology of the tumor spheroid similar to those in vivo , i . e . , the network of cell - cell interactions , the 3D structure , and the presence of a natural ECM , nutrients , metabolites , and Biomicro ﬂ uidics ARTICLE scitation . org / journal / bmf Biomicro ﬂ uidics 13 , 044108 ( 2019 ) ; doi : 10 . 1063 / 1 . 5108681 13 , 044108 - 1 Published under license by AIP Publishing . oxygen gradients . 22 More evidence has been found that the tissue structure determines the growth rate of a tumor as well as its response to anticancer drugs . 23 Despite a variety of advantages o ﬀ ered by 3D tumor spheroids for drug - screening applications as described above , they are infrequently utilized for drug screening . Limitations include a low number of e ﬀ ective spheroid cultivation methods , di ﬃ cult quantitative determination of cellular responses in the 3D arrangement , and little drug transportation information . Micro ﬂ uidic devices , which emerged recently , are believed to be a substantial solution to these limitations . 24 Micro ﬂ uidic devices can be fabricated to have multiple regions to facilitate increased spheroid formation and can allow nutrition or cell gradients to dictate the size of the spheroids produced . Additionally , drugs can be introduced in a gradient manner , which dramatically increases the device ’ s e ﬃ ciency . 25 The implementation of micro ﬂ uidic systems into 3D tumor cell culture can compensate for the absence of vasculature , support nutrition supply , and allow for ﬂ uid dynamic studies . Although plenty of work has been focused on micro ﬂ uidic - based 3D tumor spheroid drug screening , 26 , 27 there is no pilot study which pays attention to the transportation of the drug through blood vessels and its e ﬀ ects on drug e ﬃ cacy . Our group has a series of well - de ﬁ ned studies on blood vessels in vitro which allow for mimicked drug or nanodrug transportation in the blood vessel environment , based on bilayer micro ﬂ uidic devices . 28 – 32 These studies show that the endothe - lial cell ( EC ) monolayer is an obstacle for drug transportation , and it is possible to manipulate the permeability of the endothelial cell monolayer by adding speci ﬁ c chemicals such as thrombin . Thus , in this work , a bilayer micro ﬂ uidic device for in vitro blood vessel mimicking and tumor drug screening was proposed . The bilayer micro ﬂ uidic device consists of two polydimethylsilox - ane ( PDMS ) pieces with embedded channels , and the two pieces are separated by a semipermeable membrane which allows for water , oxygen , and a nutrition supply to pass through , while pre - venting cell migration . The two channels on the two PDMS pieces have long sections of channels which overlap to ensure a larger exchange area to mimic the blood vessel - tumor model . High con - centrations of EC were ﬁ rst seeded onto the membrane through the apical channel , and after a two - day culture which ensures the for - mation of a con ﬂ uent EC monolayer , tumor spheroid - laden Matrigel was seeded into the basal channel . After the Matrigel was cured in an incubator for 30 min , the devices were ready for drug testing . Confocal imaging and ImageJ were used to assess the e ﬃ cacy of di ﬀ erent drug concentrations and combinations of drug therapies . Optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) was employed to determine the tumor volume shrinkage after drug treatment . 41 , 45 , 46 MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials The media used for the HCT116 cells was Dulbecco ’ s Modi ﬁ ed Eagle ’ s Medium ( DMEM , Life Technology ) , supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS , Invitrogen ) and 1 % antibiotic and antimy - cotic ( ThermoFisher ) . Fluorescence dyes [ Calcein AM and propi - dium iodide ( PI ) ] were purchased from ThermoFisher . Dispase II was purchased from EMD Millipore . Paclitaxel was purchased from LC labs . PDMS is Sylgard 184 from Dow Corning . All chemicals that are not mentioned are directly used without purifying . Drug Paclitaxel is a microtubule - active drug that inhibits mitotic progression and arrests cells in mitosis . 33 , 34 Following the mitosis arrest , cells may either exit from mitosis or undergo apoptosis . Evidence was found that low concentrations of paclitaxel induce cell - type - dependent p53 , p21 , and G1 / G2 arrest . However , for HCT116 and other cell lines , paclitaxel cannot readily induce p53 , and , therefore , these cells can undergo exclusively mitotic and post - mitotic arrest after paclitaxel treatment . 35 Design of micro ﬂ uidic devices To ensure su ﬃ cient nutrition and oxygen supply and optimized metabolite clearance , the micro ﬂ uidic devices were designed as shown in Fig . 1 . Both apical and basal pieces were made with PDMS , and the embedded channels were formed from a preobtained silicon wafer by photolithography . The two pieces were separated by a semi - permeable membrane , which usually has dense 200 – 800 nm pores , allowing for water , nutrient , oxygen , and metabolite di ﬀ usion , while preventing cell transportation . Four outlets ( diameter = 2 mm ) on the apical piece were matched to the four circle areas for the apical and basal channels . The two channels share the same size ( 500 μ m width and 200 μ m height ) , and they have more than 80 % overlapping area , as shown in Fig . 1 . Since the two PDMS pieces are separated by the semipermeable polyurethane membrane , which has a surface that cannot be activated by plasma treating , an additional thin layer of PDMS was applied onto the whole membrane , excluding the channel area to ensure strong bonding . Fabrication of the micro ﬂ uidic devices PDMS ( Sylgard 184 ) was obtained by mixing a base agent and curing agent at a ratio of 10 : 1 ( v : v ) , respectively . PDMS was poured onto the prepared molds , and bubbles were removed via vacuum for 30 min . Molds were cured in a 60 °C oven for 30 min . PDMS with imprinted channels were peeled carefully from the mold and cut into rectangular pieces . Basal channels were on the top and bottom of the straight channel , while the apical channels formed the Z - shape . A piece with only the basal channels was paired with one piece with only apical channels ; these were then aligned to have symmetrical outlets and to match well overall . The centers of the basal outlets were matched on the apical piece , and the apical piece was then removed . A biopsy punch was used to cut four holes for the four outlets on the apical piece ; this includes two holes for the apical channel and two for the basal channel . In order to ensure smooth and e ﬃ cient cutting , the chan - nels were punched powerfully and quickly . Subsequently , the basal piece and a glass slide were cleaned using acetone and after drying , the surfaces were activated by an oxygen plasma handgun treat - ment for at least 30 s . The basal piece and glass slide were then attached and bubbles were removed . The channel side of the basal piece was then cleaned with acetone and plasma treated again , and the smooth side of a semipermeable membrane was attached to the channel side of the basal piece . A thin layer of uncured PDMS was then painted onto the ﬁ lm without touching the channel area . Being careful that PDMS was not applied to the channel was important because the PDMS should not spread to and permeate Biomicro ﬂ uidics ARTICLE scitation . org / journal / bmf Biomicro ﬂ uidics 13 , 044108 ( 2019 ) ; doi : 10 . 1063 / 1 . 5108681 13 , 044108 - 2 Published under license by AIP Publishing . the channel . The thin layer of uncured PDMS was served as a glue to adhere the apical and basal PDMS pieces as well as the semi - permeable membrane . The PDMS - coated pieces were then cured on a hot plate for 15 min . The ﬁ lm covering the two outlets on the basal pieces was then cut and removed to expose the outlets . The apical piece of the channel was then cleaned with acetone , and the PDMS - coated surface and apical piece were then plasma treated . Since the attachment process is irreversible , the apical piece was attached onto the ﬁ lm by matching the channels , holes , and outlets slowly and carefully . The piece was then cured in a 60 °C oven for 30 min . The devices were autoclaved at 100 °C for 20 min for steri - lization purposes and dried for 5 min . Endothelial layer seeding ( seed EC ﬁ rst ) Bovine aortic endothelial cells ( BAEC , we use EC for short ) were used as the endothelium model . Since ECs need some cell adhesion motifs to help them attach and grow , both apical and basal channels were incubated in an incubator with 0 . 2 % porcine gelatin solution overnight ( or for at least 3 h ) . ECs from a con ﬂ uent Petri dish were harvested to obtain a 1 × 10 7 cells / ml concentration . A droplet of EC suspension was applied to an outlet of the apical channel and was sucked through the channel by a negative pressure using a disposable pipette . After 3 h of incubation , which allowed the ECs to attach to the bottom ( the semipermeable membrane ) of the apical channel , EC media was introduced to sustain the nutri - tion supply . A con ﬂ uent monolayer of EC formed in two days . The devices were placed in a large cell culture dish with drops of steril - ized water placed around it to make the environment more humidi ﬁ ed in order to prevent the devices from drying . Tumor spheroid formation , harvest , ﬁ ltering , and seeding The tumor spheroids were formed and ﬁ ltered to uniform sizes as described in our previous work . 36 In brief , a low concentra - tion of HCT116 cells was seeded into 6 - cm diameter Petri dishes , and after 5 – 7 days of growth , dispase was used to detach the cell sheets , which were then orbitally - shaken in dispase - doped media in the same Petri dishes for at least 3 days . A set of custom ﬁ lters were used for size uniformization . In this work , the HCT116 tumor spheroids were from 100 to 120 μ m sieves , which means the spher - oids which passed through the 100 μ m sieve but did not pass through the 120 μ m sieve were used in the study . The average size of the spheroids was 151 ± 24 μ m . To create the tumor spheroid seeding mixture , the tumor spheroid suspension was diluted with Matrigel at a volume ratio of 1 : 1 . The tumor spheroids were then seeded in the micro ﬂ uidic device by placing the obtained mixture into an outlet of the basal channel and sucking on the opposite outlet of the channel with a disposable bulb pipette . This allowed for the cell suspension to ﬂ ow throughout the whole basal channel . The device was placed in the 37 °C incubator for 30 min to cure the Matrigel . To apply the media , the disposable bulb pipette method was used to administer media to the apical channel . Since two cell types were involved , the EC media was used . HCT116 can be sus - tained in EC media , with no remarkable negative e ﬀ ects observed in using EC media to culture HCT116 . After both cell seeding , the longitudinal cross - sectional diagram of the bilayer blood vessel mimicking micro ﬂ uidic device is shown in Fig . 2 . Drug testing Paclitaxel was used as a model drug for the HCT116 spheroid treatment . The drug displays a remarkable e ﬃ cacy on HCT116 33 , 34 but also on endothelial cells . 37 , 38 Thus , the endothelial layer in the device not only mimicked the blood vessel and its permeability but could also serve as the indicator for the toxicity of drug therapy on FIG . 1 . Diagram of the micro ﬂ uidic device using PDMS molds with basal and apical channels . The basal channel is the straight channel on the bottom layer of the device , where cells like human colon cancer cells ( HCT116 ) can be grown . The next layer is the semipermeable membrane , and the top layer is the apical channel , which is the Z - shaped channel . As media is ﬂ owed through the apical channel , nutrients permeate the membrane and reach the cells in the basal channel . Waste can be transported back through the membrane to the apical channel and removed from the apical channel outlet .

The drug was dissolved in EC media and diluted to di ﬀ erent concentrations [ 0M ( control ) , 1 nM , 3 nM , 10 nM , 30 nM , 100 nM , 300 nM , and 1 μ M ] , and the drug was applied using a syringe pump for a series of time frames ( a few hours to a few days ) . To demonstrate the advantages of our platform , a compari - son of the spheroids in a well plate , an EC - free device , and an EC device was made . To achieve the best drug e ﬃ cacy — greater tumor cell death and less EC death — a comparison of viability between EC and tumor cells was also made . Characterization There are two main principles to assess the e ﬃ cacy of a drug or therapy for tumor treatment . One is to measure the population of dead and live cells in a 3D tumor spheroid , which can be achieved via live / dead staining and confocal microscopy . The second way is to observe the shrinkage ratio ( or volume change ) of the 3D tumor spheroid , which can be achieved using Optical Coherence Tomography ( OCT ) . Live / deadstaining The control and drug - treated 3D tumors were stained with a Calcein AM and propidium iodide ( PI ) ( live / dead ) staining kit . To ensure a better staining e ﬀ ect , double the recommended con - centrations of the dyes and longer staining time ( 2 h ) were used . After staining , phosphate - bu ﬀ ered saline ﬂ ow was introduced for at least 1 h to clear any unbound dye . Confocal ﬂ uorescence microscopy was used to quantify the e ﬃ ciency of the drugs by comparing the dead and live cells in a certain plane of the spheroids . Since the spheroid size is usually larger than 200 μ m , only the 4× objective lens can cover this large area , though this lens lacks good z - resolution . Thus , the stacks obtained in the middle of spheroids are usually blurred and mixed with the signal from di ﬀ erent layers , which were di ﬃ cult to enumerate . In contrast , the confocal images taken from the surface of spheroids were more vivid . By comparing the di ﬀ erent z - stacking images , we found that the live and dead cell ratio on the spheroid surface could roughly represent the overall live - dead cell ratio of the whole spheroid . The surface viability of the spher - oids cannot comprehensively represent that of the whole 3D spheroid . However , in this study , we were focused on presenting a FIG . 2 .

Recently , a lot of studies were focused on how to image thick samples in a 3D manner . 39 , 40 In the following studies , we can incorporate those techniques to improve the accuracy of the tumor cell viability . Since the cells were highly compact in confocal images , ImageJ ( FIJI ) was used to process the images and enumerate the dead and live cells , as shown in Fig . 3 . In brief , an image that could represent the surface of the spheroid was selected and transferred to a 16 - bit gray scale image . The threshold was then tuned to ensure that most of the out - of - focus cells were removed . Usually , there would be some leftover cells that are packed together , and these could be distin - guished by a plug - in algorithm called Watershed , which can build dams to separate packed cells . Followed by Watershed , the Analyze Particles function was run to enumerate the total in - focus cells . The pixel cut - o ﬀ was selected as larger than 50 pixels , which correlates to half the size of a cell with 10 μ m diameter . Both live and dead cells can be counted in this way . Based on the enumeration of dead and live cells , the relative viability and drug e ﬃ cacy were de ﬁ ned as Relativeviability ¼ Numberof livecellsatcertaindrugconcentration Numberof livecellsatcontrolcondition , where Drug E ﬃ cacy = 1 − Relative viability . OCTfordeterminationof3Dtumorshrinkage OCT is an optical technique based on low - coherence interferom - etry , which is capable of obtaining 3D images . This technique does not require any staining and uses near - infrared light which allows for deeper light penetration into tissue samples during scanning in a non - destructive manner . It can also provide information about the volume of scanned objects . Because the surroundings of the tumor spheroids are transparent in this 3D tumor model , it is ideal to use OCT to monitor the size or volume changes of the 3D tumor spheroids . The volumetric quanti ﬁ cation of 3D tumor spheroids was per - formed by a voxel - based method , which was described in detail in Refs . 41 and 46 . First , a 3D average ﬁ lter was applied to remove the speckles within the tumor spheroids in the OCT images . Then , the tumor spheroid was segmented using a canny edge detection ﬁ lter , frame by frame . Connective voxels were grouped , and the mean dis - tance of grouped connective voxels to the manually chosen spheroid centroid was calculated . The group with the minimum mean distance was identi ﬁ ed as the spheroid region . The voxels within this region were summed and then multiplied by the actual volume of an individ - ual voxel ( volume / voxel ) , yielding the total volume of the spheroid . The volume change of the spheroids at di ﬀ erent drug concen - trations was de ﬁ ned as Volume change ¼ Volume atcertain drug concentration Volume atday 0 : FIG . 4 .

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Dead and live staining The viability and drug e ﬃ cacy of both cell types can be assessed using dead and live staining and confocal microscopy . It is relatively easier to address such parameters for EC , since EC were in a 2D manner . But for HCT116 spheroids , which are in a 3D conformation , and the size of which are usually larger than 200 μ m , a 4× objective lens had to be used for imaging , leading to a low resolution in the z direction . It is , therefore , di ﬃ cult to obtain an overall viability using confocal 3D scanning . However , since cells on the spheroid surface can be clearly imaged , as shown in Fig . 4 ( a ) , the viability of the spheroid surface was used to represent that of the whole 3D spheroid . As shown in Fig . 4 , a freshly prepared HCT116 spheroid of approximately a 150 μ m diameter was stained with dead / live staining and showed a strong robustness on the surface close to the objective of the microscope , with only one red spot representing a dead cell . The spheroid was obtained using a set of 105 μ m and 114 μ m ﬁ lters , and this spheroid size was chosen for all of the following studies . This intermediate size allowed for the spheroids to be accessibly FIG . 6 . Coculture of EC and HCT spheroids in the device . This is a ﬂ uores - cence image in which both cell types were stained by CellTracker Green . The image was taken from the apical side of the device . FIG . 7 .

During Petri dish culture , the necrotic core will appear when the size of tumor spheroids is larger than about 400 μ m , 36 which the spher - oids during the coculture usually would not exceed , so we did not consider the e ﬀ ect of necrosis . OCT scanning and volume information As mentioned in the section on OCT for Determination of 3D Tumor Shrinkage , OCT is one of the best ways to obtain 3D information of biological samples in the range of submillimeters to 10 mm . As OCT utilizes the refractive index of transparent objects to reproduce 3D images , all the OCT scanning was performed through the glass bottom of the devices to avoid inter - ference from the translucent semipermeable membrane . As shown in Fig . 5 , ( a ) shows an image of a cross section perpendicular to the channel ; ( b ) shows a vertical cross section , while ( c ) is a 3D rendered OCT image using the Amira software . Coculture of EC and HCT spheroids in the device As a core part of the study , coculture of EC and HCT116 spheroids in the micro ﬂ uidic device is rather important . Because of FIG . 8 . Confocal images of HCT116 spheroids subjected to 3 - day 100 nM paclitaxel ( Pac ) treatment at different conditions . All the images were split into green and red channels to more vividly show the live and dead cells .

EC always need a gelatin coating to promote the cell - substrate adhesion , and a con ﬂ uent monolayer of EC is desired . Therefore , EC are always seeded at a high concentration prior to HCT116 spheroids . After 2 – 3 days of culture , EC can reach full con ﬂ uency . Then , the spheroids may be seeded with the Matrigel . Figure 6 displays a device with HCT116 spheroids freshly seeded and stained with CellTracker Green . The EC layer on the membrane shows ample con ﬂ uency , and the three spheroids are robust . The image was taken from the top of the device , in order to view the EC layer clearly . As the spheroids were seeded , media with di ﬀ erent concentrations of drug , or drug - free media , were infused at a low ﬂ ow rate for 3 days . The behavior of both EC and spher - oids is discussed below . EC behavior under drugs Paclitaxel of a high concentration not only has negative e ﬀ ects on the HCT116 cells but also a ﬀ ects EC growth . There is ample evidence that shows even low concentrations of paclitaxel can induce senescence of EC and change their phenotype . As shown in Fig . 7 , maintaining a con ﬂ uent EC monolayer in the device with drug - free media infusion preserves the health of most of the cells and maintains a con ﬂ uent monolayer . After 3 days of 1 nM , 3 nM , and 10 nM paclitaxel infusion , the con ﬂ uency was maintained , and no dead cells were observed . The spindlelike phenotype was also preserved . However , with a higher concentration of paclitaxel infu - sion , the quantity of spindlelike cells decreased , so that almost no such cells can be found in Fig . 7 ( g ) ( 3 - day of 300 nM infusion ) . With 1 μ M drug treatment [ Fig . 7 ( h ) ] , some holes and gaps as well as dead cells could be found on the monolayer . The cell density also decreased , as shown in Fig . 7 ( i ) , which indicates that the drug killed some of the cells and the infusion removed most of the dead cells . The coverage of each cell became much larger , because there was more space for each live cell . Such a phenotype was typical , indicating that paclitaxel - induced senescence of EC reported by previous studies . 42 Drug effect on HCT116 spheroids As mentioned before , HCT116 spheroids with an average diameter of 150 μ m were seeded into the devices as well as to other control environments . Through 3 days of drug - free media treat - ment , both in ultralow attachment well plates and in the EC - loaded devices , spheroids grew vigorously with a remarkable increase in both the diameter and the quantity of dead cells on the spheroid surface , as shown in Fig . 8 . Although , due to the hindrance of the Matrigel in the channel , spheroids in EC - loaded devices were smaller than the ones freely cultured in well plates . However , through 3 days of 100 nM drug treatment , a signi ﬁ cant di ﬀ erence in spheroid condition was found among the well plate , EC - free device , and EC - loaded device . The quantitative results of volume change and relative viability of the tumor spheroids can be found in Figs . 9 and 10 , respectively . A more intuitive comparison of HCT116 viability among the three devices can be found in Fig . S1 in the supplementary material . In the well plate , there were very limited live cells left , and the whole structure was ﬁ lled with dead cells and debris . Because most of the cells were dead , the 3D spherical shape of the spheroid could not be maintained and col - lapsed . In the EC - free device , there were many dead cells and a limited amount of live cells after 3 days of treatment . Compared to the situation in the well plate , there were more live cells and less dead cells , indicating that both the membrane and the Matrigel acted as hindrances to drug delivery . In the situation of the EC - loaded device , compared to the other two experimental con - ditions , more live cells and fewer dead cells were observed after 3 days of treatment . The introduction of an EC layer dramatically hindered the delivery of the drug from the apical channel to the tumor spheroids , especially at the beginning . Tumor cells are able to in ﬂ uence the EC monolayer permeability , 43 , 44 by releasing certain types of chemokines ( such as TNF - α ) which loosen the cell - cell interactions of EC . As some of the EC were a ﬀ ected by the drug ( Fig . 7 ) , openings on the monolayer were formed which allowed the drug to pass through . The 3D structure of the spher - oids in both EC - free and EC - loaded situations was maintained , thanks to the support of the Matrigel . The half inhibitory concen - tration ( IC50 ) values of paclitaxel for the three di ﬀ erent environ - ments are 34 . 8 ± 5 . 8 nM for the well plate , 56 . 5±13 . 2 nM for the EC - free device , and 158±32 nM for the EC - loaded device . According to the drug test results in our previous work , 36 the IC50 value of paclitaxel for the 2D cell culture of HCT116 cells is 26 . 3±12 . 5 nM , which is much smaller than the one obtained by our device . Therefore , the drug - screening platform with a combi - nation of an EC layer , Matrigel , and tumor spheroids better mimics an in vivo environment compared to the monolayer cell culture method and tumor spheroid cell culture method . Combining the drug e ﬀ ect on EC as shown in Fig . 7 ( i ) , we suggest a paclitaxel concentration in blood that reaches the tumor FIG . 9 . The volume change of HCT116 spheroids in EC - loaded channels moni - tored by OCT subjected to different concentrations of paclitaxel for up to 72 h ( * P < 0 . 05 , 1 - way ANOVA and Tukey post hoc test ) .

We believe this platform has a promising potential for the antitumor drug - screening industry . CONCLUSIONS An in vitro biomimetic antitumor drug - screening platform was presented . The platform consisted of two layers with two chan - nels and a semipermeable membrane . An EC monolayer on the membrane enabled the apical channel to function as a blood vessel , which showed both permeability and resistance to several mole - cules , including drugs . Additionally , direct seeding of tumor spheroids more closely mimicked the in vivo nature of tumors , while the Matrigel served as a sca ﬀ old for the tumor spheroids , which functioned as ECM . The combination of these displayed a more biomimetic microenvironment of a blood vessel and adjacent tissue . The drug e ﬃ cacy has been expressed by two manners : the viability of tumor cells , which can be quanti ﬁ ed by dead / live stain - ing using confocal microscopy , and the volume change of the tumor spheroids , which can be quanti ﬁ ed via OCT scanning . Since both the cell culture in the micro ﬂ uidic device and the two charac - terization techniques can be automated , we believe this work can dramatically increase the e ﬃ ciency on both speed and cost on anti - tumor drug screening .
