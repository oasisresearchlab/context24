Although the molecular details of network turnover remain obscure , recent work points towards key roles in ﬁlament nucleation for Arp2 / 3 com - plex and its activator WAVE complex . Here , we combine ﬂuorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) of dif - ferent lamellipodial components with a new method of data analysis to shed light on the dynamics of actin assembly / disassembly . We show that Arp2 / 3 complex is incorporated into the network exclusively at the lamelli - podium tip , like actin , at sites coincident with WAVE complex accumulation . Capping protein likewise showed a turnover similar to actin and Arp2 / 3 complex , but was conﬁned to the tip . In contrast , cortactin—another promi - nent Arp2 / 3 complex regulator—and ADF / coﬁlin—pre - viously implicated in driving both ﬁlament nucleation and disassembly—were rapidly exchanged throughout the lamellipodium . These results suggest that Arp2 / 3 - and WAVE complex - driven actin ﬁlament nucleation at the lamellipodium tip is uncoupled from the activities of both cortactin and coﬁlin . Network turnover is addition - ally regulated by the spatially segregated activities of capping protein at the tip and coﬁlin throughout the mesh .

Cell migration requires dynamic reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton , with ﬁlaments providing mechanical support of protrusion of the front and retraction of the rear . The lamellipodium , a thin leaﬂet of plasma membrane ﬁlled with actin ﬁlaments , constitutes the key organelle generating the force for directional protrusion of the cell periphery ( Small et al , 2002 ; Pollard , 2007 ) . Importantly , the actin ﬁlaments building the lamellipodium are oriented with their fast - growing , barbed ends pointing outwards ( Small et al , 1978 ) , allowing the centrifugal growth of the network . Work over the years has largely focused on signalling pathways stimulating the formation of these structures ( Raftopoulou and Hall , 2004 ; Disanza et al , 2005 ) , and the molecular players driving actin polymerization to induce and maintain them ( Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ; Pollard , 2007 ) . Although the increase in knowledge on the biochemical activities of factors implicated in actin polymerization at the cell periphery has been signiﬁcant , the detailed actin assembly and disassembly kinetics in lamellipodia are unsettled and controversial . Breakthroughs in actin biochemistry include the discovery of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Machesky et al , 1994 ) and formins ( Woychik et al , 1990 ) , recognition of their relevance in nucleating actin ﬁlaments ( reviewed in Goley and Welch , 2006 ; Goode and Eck , 2007 ; Pollard , 2007 ) , as well as in vitro reconstitution of actin - based motility using puriﬁed proteins ( Loisel et al , 1999 ; Romero et al , 2004 ) . Spire ( Quinlan et al , 2005 ) and Cordon - Bleu ( Ahuja et al , 2007 ) , implicated in vesicle trafﬁcking and neuronal morphogenesis , respectively , add to the list of actin nucleators found in eukaryotes . There is increasing consensus on the list of molecules harbouring key functions in lamellipodium protrusion ( Small et al , 2002 ; Stradal and Scita , 2006 ) , mostly based on manipulations of protein expression or activity . Suppression of Arp2 / 3 complex components by RNA inter - ference ( RNAi ) or sequestration of the complex in the cytosol inhibits lamellipodia formation ( Machesky and Insall , 1998 ; Kunda et al , 2003 ; Steffen et al , 2006 ) . Arp2 / 3 complex activation in lamellipodia is thought to be mediated by WAVE complex ( Stradal et al , 2004 ) and cortactin , although the relevance of cortactin in this process is controversial ( Cosen - Binker and Kapus , 2006 ) . Heterodimeric capping protein is also essential for Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated moti - lity , both when reconstituted in vitro ( Loisel et al , 1999 ) and in vivo , as RNAi - mediated knockdown causes excessive ﬁlopodia formation at the expense of lamellipodia ( Mejillano et al , 2004 ) . Another protein family of comparable relevance is ADF / coﬁlin proteins , which were proposed to promote lamellipodial protrusion by driving both actin Received : 21 September 2007 ; accepted : 7 February 2008 ; published online : 28 February 2008 * Corresponding author .

All these factors are found to be enriched in lamelli - podial protrusions , sometimes with signiﬁcant spatial varia - tions ( Small et al , 2002 ) , but their turnover rates in steady - state protrusion of live lamellipodia are much less well deﬁned . For example , differences of opinion still exist about the site ( s ) of actin assembly within lamellipodia ( Wang , 1985 ; Theriot and Mitchison , 1991 ; Small , 1995 ; Watanabe and Mitchison , 2002 ) . By employing state - of - the - art bleaching and photoactiva - tion approaches combined with a new method of analysis and mathematical modelling , we revisit the mechanism of actin ﬁlament turnover in lamellipodia . Our ﬁndings , which reveal treadmilling for both actin and Arp2 / 3 complex , but uncoupling of their dynamics from cortactin and coﬁlin , call for a re - evaluation of the roles of these proteins in lamellipodia assembly . Results and discussion The turnover of lamellipodial actin was initially examined using ﬂuorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) ( Wang , 1985 ) or photoactivation ( Theriot and Mitchison , 1991 ) , leading to the proposal of two distinct models for actin ﬁlament turnover in lamellipodia , treadmilling versus nuclea - tion release , respectively . Whereas the former mechanism assumes assembly of individual lamellipodial ﬁlaments at the front and disassembly at the rear , the latter features short ﬁlaments , released from the front , and capable of continuous turnover throughout the lamellipodium ( Small , 1995 ) . Several groups have subsequently studied actin network ﬂow using ﬂuorescent speckle microscopy , which exploits inhomogeneous incorporation of low amounts of ﬂuorescent molecules into polymer ( Danuser and Waterman - Storer , 2006 ) . Again , analysis of single - molecule speckles in lamellipodia suggested that most of the actin ﬁlaments in the lamellipodium are generated away from the tip by a mechanism now termed ‘basal polymeriza - tion’ ( Watanabe and Mitchison , 2002 ) , which is inconsistent , at least in part , with more recent studies ( Hotulainen et al , 2005 ; Nakagawa et al , 2006 ; Iwasa and Mullins , 2007 ) . To re - evaluate when and where actin ﬁlaments are nu - cleated within lamellipodia of migrating cells , we bleached or photoactivated actin derivatives expressed in motile B16 - F1 melanoma cells at various subcellular locations ( Figure 1 ) . In initial experiments , a laser scanning device of a confocal microscope was used to bleach rectangular regions in lamel - lipodia of cells expressing EGFP – actin , and recovery of ﬂuorescence was recorded with wide - ﬁeld imaging , enabling high spatial and temporal resolution ( Figure 1A and Supplementary Movie 1 ) . At 2 s after bleaching , a sharp rim of actin was observed at the lamellipodium tip , which progressively expanded rearwards into more proximal regions of the lamellipodium with an average speed of 3 . 78 m m / min ( Figure 1A ) ( n ¼ 13 ) . These data already indicated a strong bias of incorporation of actin at the lamellipodium front , as observed previously ( Wang , 1985 ) , and are inconsistent with the view deduced from in vitro studies that treadmilling does not contribute much to actin ﬁlament turnover in cells ( Pollard , 2007 ) . To exclude the possibility that energy introduced into the system by bleach - ing may cause an experimentally induced modiﬁcation of actin ﬁlament dynamics in our cells , we employed two additional methods to study actin network turnover in lamellipodia : photoactivation and a pseudo - ﬂuorescence loss in photobleaching ( FLIP ) approach . Activation of photoacti - vatable EGFP - tagged actin co - expressed with mRFP – actin revealed rapid rearward ﬂow of the activated probe and its dissipation from the rear of the lamellipodium ( Figure 1B ) , which largely coincided with exchange of non - activated actin from the front ( see Supplementary Movie 2 ) . Consistent with previous observations ( Wang , 1985 ; Hotulainen et al , 2005 ; Nakagawa et al , 2006 ) , these data supported a treadmilling mode of actin ﬁlament turnover in lamellipodia . However , it was recently proposed that FRAP and photoactivation of lamellipodial actin may lead to erroneous interpretations , due to signiﬁcant turnover of the network from within the bleached or photoactivated area while ﬂowing rearward ( Watanabe and Mitchison , 2002 ) . To exclude a contribution of intra - lamellipodial assembly / disassembly events to net - work turnover , we bleached thin lines parallel to the lamelli - podial leading edge and established that the bleached lines travelled rearwards with the lamellipodial mesh ( not shown ) similar to wider bleached regions ( see above ) . In addition , we exploited the rapid translocation of unpolymerized actin to the leading edge discovered recently ( Zicha et al , 2003 ) . In this FLIP type of experiment , we rapidly bleached the lamella in a position several microns behind the lamellipodium and recorded the incorporation of bleached actin monomers into the lamellipodial actin meshwork ( Figure 1C and Supplementary Movie 3 ) . Using photoactivation , the average speed of actin translocation to the leading edge was determined to be approximately 3 . 1 7 1 . 5 m m / s in B16 - F1 cells , with peak rates in individual cells of up to 6 m m / s ( data not shown ) . In the FLIP experiment , this rapid translo - cation of unpolymerized actin was detected as the incorpora - tion of a narrow line of bleached actin into the lamellipodium tip ( Figure 1C ) . If there were an active reorganization of the lamellipodial network by intra - lamellipodial assembly / disassembly ( Watanabe and Mitchison , 2002 ) , we would expect a rapid dissipation of the line of bleached actin , which was not the case . Instead , bleached actin from the lamella that incorporated into the lamellipodium tip ﬂowed steadily rearwards in a well - deﬁned line ( Figure 1C ) , consistent with treadmilling . A Monte Carlo model of diffusion was employed to simu - late the ﬂuorescence recovery observed in the lamellipodium shown in Figure 1A ( for details on the model , see Supplementary data ) . The model that best ﬁtted the experi - mental data is shown in Figure 1D ( compare Figure 1A and D , see Supplementary Movie 4 ) and assumed actin assembly probability to be highest at the leading edge ( for actin assembly and disassembly probability proﬁles relative to the distance from the leading edge , see Figure 1E ) . From these data , we conclude that actin predominantly poly - merizes at the lamellipodium front , presumably at the inter - face between plasma membrane and the ﬁlament ends in the network abutting the membrane . However , to obtain a more unbiased determination of the dynamic behaviour of actin , applicable also to the regulatory molecules studied here , we developed a quantiﬁable parameter which we called ‘tread - milling factor’ ( TMF ) ( Figure 1F , see Supplementary Movie 5 ) . To obtain the TMF , we extracted and plotted the recovery of ﬂuorescence in both the front and the rear half of the lamellipodium over time ( Figure 1G ) .

Actin turnover in lamellipodia FPL Lai et al The EMBO Journal VOL 27 | NO 7 | 2008 & 2008 European Molecular Biology Organization 984 ﬂuorescence to compare individual movies ( see Materials and methods ) , the TMF was taken as the difference between the two curves averaged over time and constituted a direct mea - sure of biased recovery from the front ( Figure 1G ) . For the movie shown in Figure 1A , the TMF was 0 . 41 ( Figure 1G ) , which compared closely to 0 . 43 ( Figure 1H ) obtained from the computer simulation depicted in Figure 1D . According to deﬁnition , the latter value comes close to the highest possible value for a TMF for a component with continuous recovery from the front , at least for the lamellipodium width given ( see Supplementary data and below ) . In contrast , proteins with homogenous recovery over the entire lamellipodium will display TMFs close to 0 . Importantly , the TMF for EGFP – actin ( 0 . 44 ) obtained from the average curves of six movies recorded with a double scan - headed confocal ( see Supplementary Movie 6 ) was practically identical to the value observed in the simulation ( Figure 1I ) . Taken together , these data show that actin assembly in the lamellipodia of these motile cells occurs exclusively at the front , with the actin ﬁlament arrays turning over by treadmilling . In addition , rapid severing and re - annealing of actin ﬁlaments as proposed recently to drive dynamic network rearrangements in lamelli - podia ( Miyoshi et al , 2006 ) cannot occur with signiﬁcant frequency in the lamellipodia of B16 - F1 ( this study ) and MTLn3 ( see below ) cells , as well as ﬁbroblasts ( Wang , 1985 ) or neuronal cells ( Nakagawa et al , 2006 ) , because such activ - ities would preclude a strongly biased recovery from the front . Having developed a system to record and analyse the spatial and temporal features of actin network turnover in B16 - F1 lamellipodia , we turned to studying established reg - ulators of lamellipodia protrusion ; initially the actin ﬁlament nucleating Arp2 / 3 complex and its lamellipodial activators , the WAVE complex and cortactin . To ascertain reliable ana - lysis of Arp2 / 3 complex dynamics , both C - and N - terminal fusions of all seven subunits of the complex were screened for proper incorporation into lamellipodia , as described pre - viously ( Rottner et al , 2006 ) . Of these , the smallest subunits ArpC5 ( also know as p16 ) and ArpC4 ( p20 ) were selected for further analysis . In contrast to recent observations with ﬂuorescent speckle microscopy , which indicated enrichment only in the distal two - thirds of the lamellipodium ( Iwasa and Mullins , 2007 ) , we observed EGFP - tagged Arp2 / 3 com - plex subunits to accumulate in the entire lamellipodium ( Supplementary Figure 1 ) , consistent with original immuno - labelling data ( Welch et al , 1997 ) , although lamellipodia were on average narrower than in cells expressing EGFP – actin ( see below ) . Arp2 / 3 complex is considered to amplify the generation of rapidly growing barbed ends by mediating the branching of daughter ﬁlaments off the barbed ends or sides of mother ﬁlaments . Although Arp2 / 3 complex could in principle be activated by multiple molecules in lamellipodia , the WAVE complex , which is known to accumulate at the tips of these structures ( Steffen et al , 2004 ; Stradal et al , 2004 ) , is currently considered most relevant for their formation . Previous analyses of Arp2 / 3 complex speckles indicated dynamics different from actin speckles ( Watanabe and Mitchison , 2002 ) , with a biased incorporation at the lamelli - podium front ( Miyoshi et al , 2006 ; Iwasa and Mullins , 2007 ) . Irrespective of its activation , Arp2 / 3 complex may also be subject to rapid turnover in deeper lamellipodial regions , for example , upon network debranching and / or dissociation from actin , which may have previously been missed in single - molecule speckle analyses ( Iwasa and Mullins , 2007 ) . To establish lamellipodial Arp2 / 3 complex dynamics , we performed FRAP experiments with cells expressing ArpC4 ( not shown ) or ArpC5 ( Figure 2A – C ) . As shown in Figure 2A and B ( see also Supplementary Movie 7 ) , Arp2 / 3 complex largely recovered from the front , which would be consistent with its activation at the lamellipodium tip where the WAVE complex is localized ( Steffen et al , 2004 ) . Analysis of the representative cell in Figure 2A showed a signiﬁcant differ - ence between ﬂuorescence recovery at the front and rear part of the lamellipodium ( Figure 2B ) , which was conﬁrmed by the average recovery behaviour of all cells analysed ( Figure 2C ) . As expression of Arp2 / 3 complex subunits caused narrowing of the lamellipodium as compared with actin expressers and as the TMF is sensitive to changes in lamellipodium width ( see Supplementary Figure 2A and B ) , we used the average lamellipodium width of ArpC5 expres - sers for determining the TMFs of both ArpC5 and actin ( actin narrow , termed n - actin in Figure 2D ) . Interestingly , the TMF obtained for actin narrow was even less ( 0 . 28 ) than that measured for ArpC5 ( 0 . 33 ; Figure 2D ; see also Table I ) . Thus , these data conﬁrm exclusive incorporation of Arp2 / 3 com - plex at the lamellipodium front and preclude Arp2 / 3 com - plex - mediated branching along ﬁlament sides in deeper regions of the lamellipodium and / or active capping / uncap - ping dynamics on ﬁlament pointed ends ( Mullins et al , 1998 ) . Arp2 / 3 complex turns over in the lamellipodium tip region with a half - time of recovery ( t 1 / 2 ) of 7 . 1s , which is almost identical to actin ( t 1 / 2 ¼ 7 . 5s ) , as expected for components incorporated into the lamellipodium network by treadmilling . We next asked how this compares to the dynamics of the presumptive activator of Arp2 / 3 complex at the lamellipo - dium tip , the WAVE complex . Of its ﬁve constituents—the ubiquitous complex comprises Sra - 1 , Nap1 , Abi - 1 , HSPC300 and WAVE2 ( Gautreau et al , 2004 ) —Abl interacting proteins ( Abi ) were the ﬁrst to be shown to accumulate at the tips of protruding lamellipodia and ﬁlopodia ( Stradal et al , 2001 ) . Bleaching of Abi - 1 at the lamellipodium tip and analysis of its recovery revealed that Abi - 1 shows a comparably slow turn - over in this location ( Figure 2E and F , and Supplementary Movie 8 ) , with a t 1 / 2 almost double that of Arp2 / 3 complex ( 13 . 6 s ) . To examine whether Abi - 1 dynamics indeed reports back on the turnover of the entire WAVE complex , we also studied the turnover of WAVE2 . As WAVE overexpression is known to suppress the protrusion of spontaneous lamellipo - dia , FRAP experiments on reasonably bright cells had to be combined with stimulation of lamellipodia formation by aluminium ﬂuoride ( AlF 4 (cid:3) ) treatment ( Hahne et al , 2001 ) . Surprisingly , WAVE2 turnover appeared signiﬁcantly acceler - ated ( t 1 / 2 ¼ 8 . 6 ) as compared with Abi - 1 ( Figure 2G and H , and Supplementary Movie 9 ) . The increased turnover was not due to AlF 4 (cid:3) treatment , as preliminary rates measured in low WAVE2 expressers without treatment was at least as fast ( not shown ) . Comparable turnover rates ( t 1 / 2 ¼ 6 . 4 ) on the membrane were recently also reported for the haematopoietic Nap1 isoform Hem - 1 ( Weiner et al , 2007 ) . Collectively , these data suggest that Abi - 1 dynamics at the lamellipodium tip does not correlate precisely with the dynamics of the WAVE complex . However , this does not necessarily indicate disso - ciations of WAVE and Abi from each other or from other WAVE complex constituents in the lamellipodium tip . Instead , the differential turnover rates may be explained by Actin turnover in lamellipodia FPL Lai et al & 2008 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 27 | NO 7 | 2008 985 the fact that Abi - 1 is able to engage in actin regulatory complexes additional to WAVE complex ( Stradal and Scita , 2006 ) . Thus , individual Abi molecules may be retained in the lamellipodium tip by these additional interactions , for in - stance with Eps8 or Ena / VASP proteins ( Tani et al , 2003 ) . This would be consistent with the similar turnover rates ( t 1 / 2 ¼ 14 . 4 s ) observed for the Ena / VASP family member VASP ( Supplementary Figure 3 and Movie 10 ) . Notwith - standing this , Arp2 / 3 complex turnover at the lamellipodium is worthwhile to be compared with that of its activator WAVE . Although the half - times of ﬂuorescence recovery in the tip region of the lamellipodium are comparable for WAVE and Arp2 / 3 complex ( see also Table I ) , they are not inconsistent with multiple Arp2 / 3 complex activations executed by Figure 2 Arp2 / 3 complex dynamics as compared with WAVE and Abi .

Actin turnover in lamellipodia FPL Lai et al The EMBO Journal VOL 27 | NO 7 | 2008 & 2008 European Molecular Biology Organization 986 individual WAVE complex units , in analogy to what is known for Arp2 / 3 complex activators retained at bacterial or bead surfaces ( Wiesner et al , 2003 ; Carlier and Pantaloni , 2007 ; Pollard , 2007 ) . However , prerequisites for this assumption to hold true are as follows : the observed ﬂuorescence intensities of Arp2 / 3 complex and WAVE reﬂect comparable amounts of endogenous complexes present , and the actual zone of Arp2 / 3 complex activation at the membrane , corresponding to WAVE localization , is much more restricted than what we deﬁne as the tip region by light microscopy , which is likely . In any case , our data also suggest that WAVE , Abi and VASP are components of perhaps partially associated , larger protein assemblies , which share the feature of being pushed forward by the network of polymerizing actin ﬁlaments they are engaged in regulating . The second Arp2 / 3 complex activator enriched in lamelli - podia is the type II nucleation - promoting factor cortactin ( Cosen - Binker and Kapus , 2006 ) . In contrast to WAVE ( Figure 2G ) , cortactin labels the entire lamellipodium ( Figure 3A and Supplementary Figure 4A and C ) , in a manner indistinguishable from Arp2 / 3 complex ( Figure 2A , see also Supplementary Figure 1 ) . Nevertheless , its dynamics in the lamellipodium signiﬁcantly differed from that of actin and Arp2 / 3 ( Supplementary Movies 11 – 13 ) . First , cortactin did not recover in a treadmilling manner as observed for actin or the Arp2 / 3 complex ( cortactin TMFs ¼ 0 . 15 and 0 . 16 for two independent constructs , respectively ; Figure 3B and Supplementary Figure 4B ) . We conclude that the slight deviation from 0 was largely due to the density gradient of cortactin localization from distal to more proximal lamelli - podial regions ( Figure 3A ) , which tightly follows that of actin ( Rottner et al , 1999 ; Small et al , 2002 ) , and not due to partial treadmilling . This view was corroborated by the best linear ﬁt for the rear - half recovery curve , which was exponential for both cortactin constructs ( Figure 3B and Supplementary Figure 4B ) , and not sigmoidal as observed for treadmilling components such as actin and Arp2 / 3 complex ( Figures 1E and 2C ) .

Actin turnover in lamellipodia FPL Lai et al & 2008 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 27 | NO 7 | 2008 987 dium was comparably fast , albeit with moderately divergent recovery times measured for the two constructs ( t 1 / 2 ¼ 6 . 4 and 3 . 8s ; compare with t 1 / 2 of actin in the entire lamellipodium ¼ 21 . 3s ; see also Table I ) . To exclude that the two different EGFP – cortactin constructs used did not display erroneous behaviour perhaps due to being non - functional , we tested a third , independently generated EGFP – cortactin , the functionality of which had previously been conﬁrmed by reconstitution of a knockdown phenotype ( Zhu et al , 2007 ) . Not unexpectedly , this cortactin variant again displayed rapid , and continuous recovery throughout the entire lamel - lipodium , without convincing bias of recovery from the front ( Supplementary Figure 4C and Supplementary Movie 13 ) , revealing that cortactin recovery does not follow the tread - milling behaviour in lamellipodia as observed for actin and Arp2 / 3 complex . Thus , although the mechanistic subtleties of cortactin function in lamellipodia remain unclear , the dy - namics of most cortactin molecules , at least in deeper lamel - lipodial regions , is inconsistent with their engagement in the promotion of Arp2 / 3 complex activation . Through its ability to interact with both F - actin and the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Cosen - Binker and Kapus , 2006 ) , cortactin may serve to stabilize Arp2 / 3 complex - induced actin networks rather than drive their ( Arp2 / 3 - mediated ) assembly . Two other lamellipodial proteins are considered indispen - sable for proper lamellipodium protrusion and Arp2 / 3 - mediated motility in general ( Carlier and Pantaloni , 2007 ) : heterodimeric capping protein ( Mejillano et al , 2004 ) and ADF / coﬁlin ( Kiuchi et al , 2007 ) . Similar to previous observations ( Mejillano et al , 2004 ; Iwasa and Mullins , 2007 ) , we found capping protein enriched in the front region of the lamellipodium ( Supplementary Figure 5 ) , and FRAP experiments revealed a t 1 / 2 of recovery at the lamellipodium tip of approximately 7 . 2s ( Figure 3C and D , and Supplementary Movie 14 ) , almost an order of magnitude slower than deduced from speckle analysis ( Miyoshi et al , 2006 ) . The reason for this discrepancy is unclear , but could arise from the difﬁculty to ascertain speckle dynamics for proteins with tight spatial restriction , like capping protein ( Figure 3C ) , WAVE complex components or VASP . For exam - ple , ﬂuorescent speckle analysis in the same study indicated EGFP – VASP not to display any continuous association with the lamellipodium tip ( Miyoshi et al , 2006 ) , whereas FRAP experiments revealed quite slow turnover in this location ( Applewhite et al , 2007 ) ( see also Supplementary Figure 2 , Supplementary Movie 10 and Table I ) . Assuming a balance of actin assembly and disassembly in the lamellipodium at steady state , similar turnover rates at the lamellipodium tip for actin ( t 1 / 2 of approximately 7 . 5s ) and capping protein ( t 1 / 2 ¼ 7 . 2s ) indicate that capping protein does not dissociate from individual ﬁlaments until they are disassembled . This is probable at least for ﬁlaments short enough to be disassembled within the observed time frame . The depen - dence of capping protein accumulation in the tip region on actin ﬁlaments is corroborated by its loss upon ﬁlament depolymerization by latrunculin B ( Supplementary Figure 6 and Supplementary Movie 15 ) . Furthermore , the restriction of capping protein to the front is inconsistent with signiﬁcant retrograde ﬂow of capped ﬁlaments into the lamellipodium mesh . As the absence of actin assembly behind the tip region as observed here precludes the existence of elongating barbed ends throughout the lamellipodium ( see above ) , maintenance of capping behind the tip region ( if it exists ) may be accomplished by additional factors . Potential candi - dates include Eps8 or twinﬁlin ( Carlier and Pantaloni , 2007 ) , although it should be noted that none of these factors are capable apparently of compensating for an essential aspect of capping protein function in lamellipodium protrusion revealed by RNAi ( Mejillano et al , 2004 ) . An alternative explanation of the data is that heterodimeric capping protein selectively aborts growth of short , non - productive ﬁlaments , perhaps subtending non - productive angles to the protruding lamellipodium front . Future work is required to test this possibility . On the basis of in vivo and in vitro observations , ADF / coﬁlin is considered to enhance actin treadmilling by promoting both ﬁlament disassembly ( Loisel et al , 1999 ; Kiuchi et al , 2007 ) and assembly ( Ghosh et al , 2004 ; Andrianantoandro and Pollard , 2006 ) . Interestingly , Kiuchi et al ( 2007 ) concluded that ADF / coﬁlin supports protrusion by maintaining a high actin monomer pool instead of driving nucleation , but they did not examine coﬁlin dynamics in the lamellipodium . We show here that coﬁlin , which readily associates with the entire lamellipodium ( Figure 4A and Supplementary Movie 16 ) , shows FRAP dynamics markedly different from actin or Arp2 / 3 complex , with a TMF of 0 . 061 , and a t 1 / 2 for the entire lamellipodium of 6 . 5s ( Figure 4A and B ) . To exclude that ectopically expressed EGFP - tagged coﬁlin is subject to rapid inactivation by phosphorylation on serine 3 ( Kiuchi et al , 2007 ) , with the potential to change its dynamics , we also examined the turnover of a non - phospho - rylatable constitutively active mutant ( S3A ) and an inactive , phosphorylation - mimetic coﬁlin ( S3D ) . Interestingly , both mutants ( Figure 4E , and Supplementary Movies 17 and 18 ) recovered throughout the entire lamellipodium with even faster turnover rates than wild - type coﬁlin ( Figure 4E ) , indicating that phosphorylation / dephosphorylation events may retain the protein in the lamellipodium , but the TMF was virtually identical to the wild - type protein ( see also Table I ) . These data show that inactivation ( by phosphoryla - tion ) cannot have caused erratic behaviour of our wild - type coﬁlin . To prove that EGFP tagging had not generally abro - gated the functionality of our coﬁlin , its activity was exam - ined by a number of additional approaches . First , puriﬁed , EGFP - tagged coﬁlin quenched the ﬂuorescence of pyreny - lated actin ﬁlaments in a manner indistinguishable from untagged coﬁlin ( Andrianantoandro and Pollard , 2006 ) , demonstrating actin ﬁlament binding in vitro ( Figure 4C ) . In addition , co - immunoprecipitations showed interaction of all expressed EGFP - tagged coﬁlin variants with actin in cell extracts , although , as expected , with less efﬁciency for the inactive variant ( Supplementary Figure 7 ) . Furthermore , ﬁla - ment depolymerization / severing mediated by EGFP - tagged wild - type coﬁlin was demonstrated both by co - sedimentation assay ( Figure 4D ) and by direct observation of fragmentation of individual actin ﬁlaments by total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy ( Supplementary Figure 8 ) . Thus , no indication was obtained to suggest that EGFP tagging abrogated the function of the coﬁlin variants used here , neither in vivo nor in vitro . Importantly , and as opposed to previous suggestions ( Ghosh et al , 2004 ) , comparison of actin and coﬁlin dynamics in lamellipodia thus precludes a signiﬁcant role for coﬁlin in promoting nucleation , at least in B16 - F1 cells . Instead , our data are consistent with coﬁlin Actin turnover in lamellipodia FPL Lai et al The EMBO Journal VOL 27 | NO 7 | 2008 & 2008 European Molecular Biology Organization 988 supporting protrusion indirectly by promoting F - actin disas - sembly both in lamellipodia and other cellular locations ( Kiuchi et al , 2007 ) . Finally , to conﬁrm the general relevance of this observation , we extended our experimental approach to MTLn3 mammary carcinoma cells , which are frequently used to study coﬁlin function in vivo ( Ghosh et al , 2004 ; van Figure 4 Characterization of coﬁlin turnover in B16 - F1 cells . ( A ) FRAP of EGFP - tagged coﬁlin wild type as indicated . Time : seconds ; bar : 2 m m . ( B ) Summary of treadmilling analysis for wild - type coﬁlin . Data are means and s . e . m . of ﬁve independent movies as well as linear ﬁts of averaged data for front and back halves of the lamellipodium as indicated . Virtually no difference in ﬂuorescence recovery between front and back lamellipodial halves was observed ( TMF ¼ 0 . 061 ) . t 1 / 2 was calculated for entire lamellipodium . ( C ) Quenching of pyrenyl ﬂuorescence by coﬁlin . Polymerized actin containing 10 % pyrenyl - actin was diluted to 3 m M in a ﬁnal volume of 1ml , and after 100s either 1 m M coﬁlin ( left ) or 1 m M EGFP – coﬁlin ( right ) were added ( 10 m l each ) as indicated . After 200s , 10 m l of 1 (cid:4) actin polymerization buffer was added to the samples . The addition of both EGFP - tagged and untagged coﬁlin resulted in considerable quenching of pyrenyl ﬂuorescence due to actin ﬁlament side binding , whereas buffer addition had no effect . ( D ) EGFP - tagged coﬁlin binds and depolymerizes actin ﬁlaments . ( Left ) 3 m M of polymerized actin was incubated with either 3 m M coﬁlin or 3 m M EGFP – coﬁlin for 2h at 21 1 C . After high - speed sedimentation , proteins from pellets ( P ) and supernatants ( S ) were analysed by SDS – PAGE and Coomassie blue staining . Both coﬁlins are able to bind actin ﬁlaments as revealed by their appearance in the pellets ( P ) , and their presence causes a considerable amount of actin to shift to the supernatant ( S ) fractions . Thus , in addition to binding , both coﬁlin variants promote actin ﬁlament disassembly in an indistinguishable manner . ( Right ) Neither coﬁlin variant is found in the pellet fraction in the absence of actin . ( E ) Best linear ﬁts of averaged data from treadmilling analyses performed on FRAP movies acquired as shown in ( A ) of active ( solid lines ) and inactive ( dashed lines ) coﬁlin mutants as indicated ( at least three movies for each mutant ) . Respective t 1 / 2 values were calculated for the entire lamellipodium . Actin turnover in lamellipodia FPL Lai et al & 2008 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 27 | NO 7 | 2008 989 Rheenen et al , 2007 ) . MTLn3 cells expressing EGFP – actin or coﬁlin were induced to form lamellipodia with EGF and subjected to FRAP analysis as described above ( Figure 5 and Supplementary Movies 19 and 20 ) . Interestingly , the actin network in lamellipodia stimulated by EGF also turned over by treadmilling , whereas coﬁlin did not , indistin - guishable from the observations made with B16 - F1 cells moving on laminin . Collectively , from previous work and the data presented here , we provide a comprehensive model of steady - state lamellipodium protrusion ( Figure 6 ) , in which Arp2 / 3 - mediated birth of ﬁla - ments at the lamellipodium tip—activated by WAVE complex—is counterbalanced by capping of unproductive ﬁlaments at the tip and actin disassembly from the rear . In this scenario , neither cortactin nor coﬁlin is engaged in nucleation ( Ghosh et al , 2004 ; Andrianantoandro and Pollard , 2006 ; Cosen - Binker and Kapus , 2006 ) or severing and re - annealing , as proposed for coﬁlin recently ( Miyoshi et al , 2006 ) . Our ﬁndings call for a revision of ideas about lamellipodia turnover ( Watanabe and Mitchison , 2002 ) and the role of cortactin in actin - based motile processes . Materials and methods DNA constructs and protein puriﬁcation The DNA constructs used here are listed in Supplementary data . GST - tagged coﬁlin constructs were expressed in Escherichia coli strain Rossetta ( Promega ) and puriﬁed from bacterial extracts on glutathione - conjugated agarose ( Sigma - Aldrich , Germany ) using Figure 5 Actin and coﬁlin turnover in MTLn3 cells .

Note exclusive recovery of actin but not coﬁlin from the front . Figure 6 Schematic model summarizing the major results obtained in this study . ( A ) The lamellipodium is built by components , which fall into different categories . Here , we distinguish four of those categories , based on their localization pattern within the lamellipodial structure , their dynamics and / or function : tip components driving actin assembly from the barbed end ( WAVE complex components or VASP ) ; capping protein , also largely associating with the tip ; components incorporating into and building the network ( actin and Arp2 / 3 complex ) , clearly displaying treadmilling behaviour ; and factors associating with the entire lamellipodium ( coﬁlin and cortactin ) without treadmilling . ( B ) Summary of the turnover rates measured for these lamellipodial regulators as indicated . Colour code is displayed on the right . Note that for components with biased recovery from the lamellipodium tip ( actin and Arp2 / 3 complex ) , recovery times differ dependent on the distance from the distal tip . For cortactin , the gradual decrease in colour intensity indicates the decrease in ﬂuorescence intensity from front to rear of the lamellipodium observed for this component , but not for coﬁlin . Cream - coloured boxes summarize turnover rates ( expressed as half - times of recovery of ﬂuorescence intensity ) as measured for different components in different intra - lamellipodial regions . * Value measured for the cortactin – EGFP construct used in Figure 3 . Actin turnover in lamellipodia FPL Lai et al The EMBO Journal VOL 27 | NO 7 | 2008 & 2008 European Molecular Biology Organization 990 standard procedures . The GST tags were cleaved by incubating the puriﬁed fusion proteins with PreScission protease in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) , pH 7 . 3 , supplemented with 1mM dithio - threitol ( DTT ) and 1mM EDTA overnight at 4 1 C . After cleavage , the GST tags were removed by passing the protein solution over glutathione - conjugated agarose columns . Coﬁlin and EGFP – coﬁlin remained in the ﬂow through and were subsequently dialysed against PBS containing 1mM DTT and 5mM benzamidine . Protein concentrations were calculated from the predicted extinction coefﬁcients ( Invitrogen ; Vector NTI software ) . Actin was puriﬁed from rabbit skeletal muscle as described ( Spudich and Watt , 1971 ) and subsequently gel ﬁltered on a Superdex 200 column using an A¨KTA puriﬁer system ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) . F - actin co - sedimentation and pyrene assays For high - speed actin sedimentation assays , G - actin was ﬁrst polymerized in actin polymerization buffer containing 10mM imidazole , 2mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2mM CaCl 2 , 1mM Na - ATP , 1mM DTT and 50mM KCl , pH 7 . 2 for 2h at 21 1 C . Subsequently , ﬁlamentous actin was incubated in actin polymerization buffer either in the presence or absence of untagged or GFP - tagged coﬁlin for additional 2h at 21 1 C . The protein mixtures were then sedimented at 100000 g in a Beckman Optima table top ultracentrifuge for 30min , and the pellets brought to the original volume in SDS sample buffer . Pellet and supernatant fractions were analysed by SDS – PAGE and Coomassie blue staining . Quenching of pyrenyl ﬂuorescence by coﬁlin was determined by ﬂuorescence spectroscopy on a Jasco FP - 6500 spectroﬂuorometer at 343nm excitation wavelength and 384nm emission wavelength . Brieﬂy , 3 m M F - actin ( 10 % pyrenyl labeled ) in actin polymerization buffer was measured alone or after the addition of either untagged or GFP - tagged coﬁlin ( 1 m M each ) at 21 1 C . Cells , transfections and immunoprecipitations Mouse melanoma cells ( B16 - F1 ) were from American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC CRL - 6323 ) and maintained in DMEM ( Invitrogen , Germany ) with 10 % FCS ( PAA Laboratories , Austria ) at 37 1 C in the presence of 5 % CO 2 . MTLn3 cells , kindly provided by Jeff Segall and Bob van de Water , were maintained in DMEM , 5 % FBS ( Sigma ) and 2mM glutamine . Cells were transfected using Superfect ( Invitrogen ) and Fugene HD ( Roche ) for B16 - F1 and MTLn3 , respectively . Following transfection , B16 - F1 cells were plated in Ham’s F12 medium ( Sigma - Aldrich ) containing 10 % FCS onto acid - washed glass coverslips coated with 25 m g / ml laminin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , and examined on the same day . Aluminium ﬂuoride treatment was carried out as described ( Steffen et al , 2004 ) . MTLn3 cells were seeded on glass overnight and stimulated with EGF ( 5nM ) shortly before movie acquisition . FRAP Cells were observed in an open , heated chamber ( Warner Instruments , Reading , UK ) at 37 1 C on inverted microscopes . FRAP experiments were performed by utilizing different scanning confocal microscope systems . Initial experiments as the one shown in Figure 1A were performed on a LSM 510 Meta ( Zeiss , Jena , Germany ) , which was equipped with a 100 (cid:4) , 1 . 45NA a Plan - FLUAR TIRF objective ( Zeiss ) and an interline transfer , progressive scan CCD camera ( Coolsnap HQ ; Photometrics , Tucson , AZ , USA ) driven by Metamorph software ( Molecular Devices Corp . , Down - ingtown , PA , USA ) . Selected cellular areas covering parts of protruding lamellipodia were bleached ( 30 iterations at full laser power at 488nm , 30mW argon laser ) immediately after and before one full - frame scan of respective ﬁelds , which was followed by switching to epi - ﬂuorescence imaging using a mercury lamp ( 100W ) as light source . Switching time was approximately 2s . The majority of experiments was performed using a double - scan - headed confocal microscope ( Fluoview1000 , Olympus ) , allowing simultaneous imaging of EGFP - and / or RFP - tagged probes ( with 30mW 488nm multiline argon and / or 20mW 561nm solid - state lasers , respectively ) and photobleaching / activation using a 20mW 405nm diode laser . Circular regions and rectangles were bleached / photoactivated in the tornado and regular line - scanning modes , respectively . Output laser powers were approximately 5 – 10 % for photobleaching and o 5 % for photoactivation . EGFP and mRFP imaging was carried out at laser powers of approximately 1 – 5 and 10 – 20 % , respectively . A 100 (cid:4) / 1 . 45NA PlanApo TIRF objective ( Olympus Inc . ) was used in all experiments . Most movies were acquired at a scanning rate of 1 . 644s per frame . Image analysis was carried out on a PC using FV10 - ASW 1 . 6 viewer ( Olympus Inc . , Olympus , Hamburg , Germany ) , ImageJ ( http : / / rsb . info . nih . gov / ij / ) , Metamorph ( Molecular Devices Corp . ) and Adobe Photoshop CS software . FRAP data were analysed as described in Supplementary data , using SigmaPlot 10 . 0 ( Scientiﬁc Solutions SA , Pully - Lausanne , Switzerland ) and Microsoft Excel 2000 . The diagrams shown in Figures 1F and 6 were drawn using Microsoft Powerpoint 2000 and Adobe Illustrator CS2 , respectively . The simulations of actin recovery in the lamellipodium were carried out as detailed in the Supplementary data and using Mathematica version 5 . 2 .
