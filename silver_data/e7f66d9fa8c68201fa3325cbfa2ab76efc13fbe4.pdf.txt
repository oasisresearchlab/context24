To fulfill the specific needs of these diverse cellular processes , actin filaments assemble into a variety of structures with different architectures and dynamic properties and produce force through coordinated filament polymerization , as well as by serving as tracks for myosin motor proteins . Actin filaments of the different cytoskeletal structures associate with specific sets of actin - binding proteins , which give rise to distinct properties of actin filaments ( Blanchoin et al . , 2014 ; Boiero Sanders et al . , 2020 ) . In plants , the functional variety of actin filament structures has been proposed to derive from the presence of a large number of closely related actin isoforms ( Gunning et al . , 2015a ) . In contrast , fungi and metazoan cells express only one or few actin isoforms , and thus the functionally different actin filament structures in these organisms rely on proteins interacting with actin . These include tropomyosins ( Tpms ) , which are elongated a - helical dimers that form head - to - tail oligomers along actin filaments . Tpms control the interactions of other proteins with actin filaments and regulate the stability of the actin filaments ( Gunning et al . , 2015b ) . The functions of Tpms have been studied extensively in striated muscles . Tpms , together with a heteromeric protein complex consisting of troponin T , troponin I , and troponin C , control the association of myosin motor II domains of thick filaments with thin actin filaments in a Ca 2 + - dependent manner ( Geeves , 2012 ) . Recent cryogenic electron microscopy ( cryo - EM ) structures shed light on the mechanisms by which muscle Tpms ( Tpm1 . 1 homodimer or Tmp1 . 1 / Tpm2 . 2 . heterodimers ) interact with muscle actin filaments , and how the Tpm – troponin complex controls association of myosin II motor domains with actin filaments in muscle sarcomeres ( Behrmann et al . , 2012 ; Doran et al . , 2020 ; Risi et al . , 2021 ; Von der Ecken et al . , 2015 ; Yamada et al . , 2020 ) . In an inactive Ca 2 + - free state ( also referred to as blocked or ‘B - state’ ) , the troponin complex stabilizes Tpm on an actin filament in a position that hinders myosin motor domain interaction . In the presence of Ca 2 + , the troponin complex undergoes a conformational change , which shifts the Tpm oligomer within the major groove of the actin filament by ~ 10 Å to the ‘C - state’ , where the myosin - binding site is partially uncovered ( Yamada et al . , 2020 ) . Myosin - binding to the actin filament further moves Tpm to an otherwise energetically unfavorable ‘M - state’ position on an actin filament , resulting in actin - mediated activation of the myosin ATPase ( Behrmann et al . , 2012 ; Doran et al . , 2020 ; Risi et al . , 2021 ) . In the absence of troponin complex and other proteins ( apo or ‘A - state’ ) , Tpm binds to an intermediate position between the B - and C - states that overlaps with the myosin - binding site ( Von der Ecken et al . , 2015 ) . Tropomyosins play important roles also in non - muscle cells where they can activate myosins similarly to striated muscles , as well as inhibit actin - interactions of other proteins such as ADF / cofilin and fimbrin ( Christensen et al . , 2017 ; Coulton et al . , 2010 ; Ono and Ono , 2002 ) . Consequently , in animal non - muscle cells , Tpms are critical for the maintenance and function of actomyosin structures ( Kumari et al . , 2020 ; Tojkander et al . , 2011 ) . A large number ( > 40 ) of different 3 Tpm isoforms can be generated through alternative splicing from four TPM genes in mammals , and several different Tpm isoforms are typically co - expressed in non - muscle cells ( Meiring et al . , 2019b ) . Depending on their length , these proteins can be classified into high - and low - molecular - weight Tpms . Different non - muscle Tpm isoforms typically display at least partially non - overlapping localization patterns in cells and are functionally non - redundant with each other ( Bach et al . , 2009 ; Bryce et al . , 2003 ; Cagigas et al . , 2021 ; Gallant et al . , 2011 ; Johnson et al . , 2014 ; Meiring et al . , 2019a ; Tojkander et al . , 2011 ) . Moreover , biochemical studies on a subset of the most abundant non - muscle Tpm isoforms revealed that they differentially affect ADF / cofilin - mediated actin filament disassembly and activation of non - muscle myosin II . For example , Tpm1 . 6 and Tpm1 . 7 inhibit ADF / cofilin - catalysed actin filament severing but do not activate myosin II . On the other hand , Tpm3 . 1 , Tpm3 . 2 , and Tpm4 . 2 do not efficiently protect actin filaments from ADF / cofilin but increase the non - muscle myosin II steady - state ATPase rate ( Gateva et al . , 2017 ; Jansen and Goode , 2019 ; Pathan - Chhatbar et al . , 2018 ) . Despite the importance of different Tpm isoforms in specifying functionally distinct actin filaments in non - muscle cells , the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive . We hypothesized that the functional differences of the non - muscle tropomyosins may arise from their different effects on the conformation of the actin filament they interact with , or because that their interactions with the actin filament , and thus their positions relative to it , are different . The distinct functions could also be , at least partially , due to differences in the amino acid sequences of Tpms that could modulate the binding of other proteins on Tpm - decorated actin filaments . To address these different hypotheses , we focused here on two functionally distinct members of the family , Tpm1 . 6 and Tpm3 . 2 . Of these two , Tpm1 . 6 exhibits a very slow off - rate from actin filaments , protects filaments from ADF / cofilin - catalysed severing but does not activate non - muscle myosin II . Tpm3 . 2 , on the other hand , displays rapid dynamics on actin filaments and accelerates the steady - state ATPase rate of non - muscle myosin II in the presence of actin filaments , but does not efficiently protect actin filaments from ADF / cofilin ( Gateva et al . , 2017 ) . By determining the cryogenic electron microscopy ( cryo - EM ) structures of b / g - actin filaments decorated either by Tpm1 . 6 or by Tpm3 . 2 , we revealed that the conformation of the actin filament remains unaffected . However , the two non - muscle Tpm isoforms follow slightly different paths along the major groove of the actin filament . Molecular modeling provides a plausible explanation for the incapability of these two Tpm isoforms to co - polymerize with each other on actin filaments and for their different effects on myosin II and ADF / cofilins . This is further corroborated by our biochemical assays . Taken together , our results shed light on the specific biochemical activities of non - muscle tropomyosins . 4 RESULTS Structures of b / g - actin filaments decorated with non - muscle tropomyosins To determine the molecular architecture of functionally distinct non - muscle actin – tropomyosin complexes , we expressed and purified Tpm1 . 6 and Tpm3 . 2 isoforms . Tpm1 . 6 is a high - molecular - weight Tpm ( 284 residues ) generated from the TPM1 gene , whereas Tpm3 . 2 is a low - molecular - weight Tpm ( 248 residues ) generated from the TPM3 gene . The two isoforms display high amino acid sequence conservation in their central regions but differ especially in the regions adjacent to their ends ( Fig . S1 ) . We performed cryo - EM imaging on reconstituted complexes of both Tpm1 . 6 and 3 . 2 with b / g - actin filaments . Our initial attempts to image the complexes revealed only bare actin , although either Tpm1 . 6 or Tpm3 . 2 had been added in excess . However , replacing NaCl in the sample buffer with sodium acetate ( see Methods ) , as previously done in studies on muscle actin : Tpm : myosin complexes ( Doran et al . , 2020 ) , resulted in a good decoration of actin filaments by both non - muscle Tpms . Using a single - particle - based helical reconstruction approach ( He and Scheres , 2017 ) , we reconstructed the 3D structure of the actin : Tpm1 . 6 complex at an average resolution of 3 . 9 Å ( Fig 1A , B , Fig . S2 , Table S1 ) . The filament measures approximately 90 Å in diameter ( Fig . 1A ) . Actin was well - resolved , allowing atomic model building . The Tpm1 . 6 density was ordered sufficiently to separate the coiled - coils formed by the two a - helices in the Tpm1 . 6 dimer ( Fig . 1A , B ) . However , the symmetry mismatch in the actin : Tpm1 . 6 assemblies , owing to the binding of one Tpm molecule per several actin monomers , hampered resolving the side chains of Tpm1 . 6 amino acid residues in the averaged density ( Von der Ecken et al . , 2015 ) . Furthermore , the backbones of Tpm1 . 6 a - helices in the coiled - coil were unresolved , suggesting that the turn of the a - helix is not in phase with the symmetry of the actin filament , resulting in incoherent averaging of the Tpm1 . 6 backbone . Notably , the binding of Tpm1 . 6 left the structure of the actin filament unaltered ; the refined helical symmetry parameters of actin : Tpm1 . 6 ( rise 27 . 8 Å ; turn : – 166 . 5° ) were nearly identical to those of bare chicken muscle actin ( 27 . 5 Å , – 166 . 6° ) reported earlier ( Chou and Pollard , 2019 ) . To compare the binding of Tpm3 . 2 and Tpm1 . 6 to actin filaments , we also determined the structure of actin : Tpm3 . 2 complex to 4 . 6 - Å resolution , using the same method as above ( Fig . 1C ; Fig . S3 ; Supplementary Table S1 ) . A comparison of the Tpm densities relative to actin in these two complexes showed that the Tpm1 . 6 and Tpm3 . 2 dimers bind on different tracks on the surface of the actin filament ( Fig . 1B , C ) . In both complexes , the Tpm binds to the major groove region of actin involving actin subdomains 1 , 3 , and 4 , but excluding residues of actin subdomain 2 ( Fig 1D , E ) . However , the position of Tpm3 . 2 is shifted slightly ( ~ 5 Å ) toward subdomains 3 and 4 when compared to the position of Tpm1 . 6 . The root - mean - square - deviation ( RMSD ) was 1 . 02 Å for Tpm1 . 6 - decorated actin ( between 364 C a - atom positions ) and 1 . 08 Å for Tpm3 . 2 - decorated actin ( between 365 C a - atom positions ) when compared to bare actin ( PDB : 6DJO ) ( Chou and Pollard , 2019 ) , indicating that all three actin structures have a highly similar conformation . The helical parameters of Tpm3 . 2 - decorated actin ( rise 27 . 8 Å , turn – 5 166 . 4° ) were also nearly identical to those of bare actin . Together , these structures reveal that the two functionally distinct non - muscle Tpm isoforms leave the conformation of the actin filament unaffected but follow slightly different paths along the major groove of the actin filament . Two non - muscle tropomyosin isoforms bind actin via analogous salt bridges In the absence of cryo - EM density for tropomyosin side chains , we turned to atomistic modeling using Rosetta to study the detailed interactions of Tpm1 . 6 and Tpm3 . 2 with actin filaments . We modeled the two Tpms as coiled - coils by combining AlphaFold with Rosetta - based energy minimization using the cryo - EM density maps . The interfaces generated by Alphafold were verified by Rosetta threading ( see Methods ) . The longer Tpm1 . 6 and shorter Tpm3 . 2 models span the distance of about seven and six actin monomers , respectively ( Fig . 2 ) . To study the charge complementarity between actin and Tpms , we calculated their electrostatic surfaces together with that of actin . A positively charged region on actin resides in the proximity of the Tpm density ( Fig . S4 ) . It corresponds to residues Lys326 and Lys328 , which have been predicted to bind tropomyosins via salt bridges , alongside negatively charged Asp311 ( Lehman et al . , 2019 ; Pavadai et al . , 2020 ) ( see below ) . Most of the actin - facing side of both Tpm1 . 6 ( Fig . 2B ) and Tpm3 . 2 ( Fig . 2C ) is negatively charged . A notable exception is the N - terminus , which is positively charged in both tropomyosin isoforms ( Fig . S1 ) . In the energy minimized Rosetta models , the actin residues Lys326 , Lys328 , and Asp311 were observed to interact with both Tpms in most of the actin - binding sites ( in total 7 for Tpm1 . 6 and 6 for Tpm 3 . 2 ; Fig . 2 ; Table 1 ) . Lys326 and Lys328 interact with side chains of two glutamate residues ( in one instance the side chain of an aspartate residue ) in one of the two Tpm a - helices , separated approximately by one turn of the a - helix ( four residues apart ) . The models also revealed another type of salt bridge , where Asp311 on actin interacts with a lysine residue on the Tpm . Are there alternative binding modes between actin and Tpm to those described above ? We tested this by sliding the Tpm coiled - coil models through the Tpm cryo - EM density at steps corresponding to one a - helical turn ( ~ 5 . 5 Å ) and keeping the Tpm coil - coil interface fixed ( see Methods ) . We calculated relative Rosetta binding energy for the actin – Tpm interface at each position ( Fig . S5 ) . The models described above ( no translation ) had the lowest interface energies , supporting the notion that Tpm prefers these binding modes . After the Tpm chain had been translated by the distance of two actins ( corresponding to 22 and 23 a - helical turns in Tpm1 . 6 and Tpm3 . 2 , respectively ) , the same binding modes as described above were repeated . Sliding the Tpm sequences by the distance of one actin ( corresponding to 12 a - helical turns in both Tpms ) , in turn , resulted in either the same ( for Tpm1 . 6 ) or slightly higher ( for Tpm3 . 2 ) energy . This alternate binding mode is feasible because the two a - helices in the coiled - coils alternate in making contacts to actin ; in every second position , the other a - helix from the coiled - coil is proximal to actin . However , the phase of the a - helices differs between consecutive actin - binding sites ( Fig . 2B , C ) . While in some positions the salt bridges are maintained , in other positions none or fewer of the actin 6 sidechain rotamers are able to accommodate the shift in the Tpm a - helix , disrupting the salt bridges . The changing phase of the a - helix is also consistent with the absence of backbone signal in the cryo - EM density maps . To conclude , our modeling not only predicts the same actin residues ( Lys326 , Lys328 , and Asp311 ) that have been indicated in Tpm binding earlier ( Lehman et al . , 2019 ; Pavadai et al . , 2020 ) but provides further insights into their role in binding . Lys326 and Lys328 exhibit at least two different rotamers , one pointing up and one down . These , together with the Tpm sequence at different actin interfaces , may provide enough flexibility to facilitate Tpm binding in different positions . Different Tpm sequences , vertical shift , and different sidechain rotamers likely accommodate the 5 - Å lateral shift observed between the cryo - EM density between Tpm1 . 6 and Tpm3 . 2 tracks . A structure - based rationale for the absence of isoform mixing between Tpm1 . 6 and Tpm3 . 2 Earlier studies provided evidence that Tpm1 . 6 and Tpm3 . 2 cannot co - polymerize on the same actin filament , and thus segregate to different actin filament structures in cells ( Gateva et al . , 2017 ; Tojkander et al . , 2011 ) . The molecular basis behind these observations , however , has remained unclear . We addressed this question by using the actin : Tpm1 . 6 and actin : Tpm3 . 2 models . Placement of two Tpm1 . 6 coiled - coil Rosetta minimum - energy models consecutively on the same side of the actin filament allows the juxtaposition of the N - terminus from one dimer with the C - terminus of the next dimer ( Fig . 3A ) . While the head - to - tail interaction is not revealed in our cryo - EM structures or Rosetta modeling , the juxtaposition shows that the phase of the Tpm1 . 6 a - helices and their positions match at the interaction site . The same is true for a homotypic juxtaposition of Tpm 3 . 2 coiled - coil with another Tpm 3 . 2 ( Fig . 3B ) . In contrast , a heterotypic juxtaposition of Tpm1 . 6 and Tpm3 . 2 consecutively on an actin filament shows that neither the phase of the a - helices , nor their position matches those of the a - helices in the next coiled - coil ( Fig . 3C , D ) . It is conceivable that both the phase of the a - helix and the position of the Tpm ends may play a role in promoting the formation of favorable head - to - tail interactions and further co - operative binding of the same isoform type on an actin filament . Thus , in addition to sequence - specific interactions between the N - and C - termini of Tpm dimers ( Greenfield et al . , 2006 ; Li et al . , 2014 ; Rao et al . , 2012 ) , these geometrical factors indicated by our modeling are likely to play a crucial role in preventing heterotypic Tpm head - to - tail interactions . This hypothesis , based on the geometrical considerations and the observed 5 - Å shift between Tpm1 . 6 and Tpm3 . 2 densities , requires further validation by cryo - EM of actin : Tpm1 . 6 and actin : Tpm3 . 2 complexes where the Tpm ends can be resolved . This could be possible by extending the approaches applied recently to visualize the muscle Tpm ends at low resolution in actin : Tpm : troponin complex ( Yamada et al . , 2020 ) . Comparison of structures reveals similarities and differences between non - muscle and muscle tropomyosin binding modes 7 We next compared the structures of actin : Tpm1 . 6 and actin : Tpm3 . 2 to the previously reported complexes between actin and muscle Tpms . The long non - muscle isoform Tpm1 . 6 occupies nearly the same position on actin as the skeletal muscle Tpm1 . 1 ( Fig . 4A , B ) ( Von der Ecken et al . , 2015 ) , showing a shift of 2 Å in the direction of the filament long axis and rotation of 0 . 7 degrees around the axis . This ‘A - state’ position corresponds to the state of muscle Tpm on actin filament when no other proteins are present . In this context , it is important to note that muscle Tpm and non - muscle Tpm1 . 6 are encoded by the same TPM1 gene , the only difference being that , as a result of alternative splicing , the last 27 amino acid residues of Tpm1 . 6 are different from those of Tpm1 . 1 ( Fig . S1 ) . In conclusion , this comparison shows that the C - terminal part of Tpm1 is not required for binding to the A - state position , but rather that both Tpm1 . 1 and Tpm1 . 6 bind the same position presumably via equivalent interactions . The C - terminal part , which is quite different between Tpm1 . 1 and Tpm1 . 6 , may however play a role in preventing the mixing of different isoforms and / or promoting the binding of the next tropomyosin dimer via head - to - tail interactions . The position of non - muscle Tpm3 . 2 , in turn , is between the A - state and the myosin - bound M - state observed in the muscle actin : Tpm complex ( Behrmann et al . , 2012 ; Risi et al . , 2021 ) ( Fig . 4C , D ) . This state , denoted here as the A’ - state , shows the Tpm3 . 2 shifted 7 Å along the filament long axis and rotated 8 degrees around it ( the rotation corresponding to a horizontal shift of ~ 6 Å ; see Fig . 1E ) relative to the muscle tropomyosin in the A - state ( Figure 4C ) . For comparison , muscle Tpm in the M - state is shifted 23 Å and rotated 15 degrees relative to the A - state ( Fig . 4D ) . Interplay of non - muscle tropomyosins with myosin II and ADF / cofilin To evaluate if the different positions of Tpm1 . 6 ( A - state ) and Tpm3 . 2 ( A’ - state ) on an actin filament affect their interactions with myosin II and ADF / cofilin , we carried out further binding experiments . An actin filament co - sedimentation assay demonstrated that ADP - loaded muscle myosin II S1 fragment binds with indistinguishable affinity to both Tmp1 . 6 and Tpm3 . 2 - decorated actin filaments ( Fig . S6A ) . Nevertheless , and similar to earlier experiments on non - muscle myosin II ( Gateva et al . , 2017 ) , Tpm3 . 2 - decorated actin filaments enhanced the actin - induced muscle myosin II ATPase activity when compared to bare actin or actin filaments decorated with Tpm1 . 6 ( Fig . S6B ) . In conclusion , both non - muscle Tpm isoforms studied here allow myosin II binding to actin filaments , but only Tpm3 . 2 activates myosin II . ADF / cofilin binds actin filaments in a cooperative manner and severs filaments at the boundaries between free and ADF / cofilin - decorated segments ( Andrianantoandro and Pollard , 2006 ; Suarez et al . , 2011 ; Wioland et al . , 2017 ) . ADF / cofilin and Tpms compete for actin binding , and Tpm isoforms protect actin filaments from ADF / cofilin - mediated severing to different extent ( Gateva et al . , 2017 ; Jansen and Goode , 2019 ; Ono and Ono , 2002 ) . Interestingly , when the most abundant mammalian ADF / cofilin isoform , cofilin - 1 , is docked to Tpm – actin filaments by using earlier structural information ( Tanaka et al . , 2018 ) , more pronounced steric clashes occur with Tpm1 . 6 than with Tpm3 . 2 ( Fig . 5A - C ) . 8 To directly test ADF / cofilin - binding on actin filaments decorated by either with Tpm1 . 6 or Tpm3 . 2 , we performed in vitro TIRF microscopy on sfGFP - fusions of Tpm1 . 6 and Tpm3 . 2 , and mCherry - fusion of human cofilin - 1 . We first prepared sfGFP - Tpm - decorated actin filaments , mixed these with mCherry - cofilin - 1 , and imaged the samples immediately after mixing by TIRF microscopy . At our experimental conditions , we observed both individual actin filaments and filament bundles ( Fig . 5D ) . Importantly , already at early time points , cofilin - 1 segments were more visible on Tpm3 . 2 - decorated actin filaments and filament bundles compared to Tpm . 1 . 6 - decorated filaments and bundles , and these differences became more pronounced after 30 min incubation ( Fig . 5D , E ) . Thus , Tpm1 . 6 and Tpm3 . 2 inhibit actin filament binding of ADF / cofilin to different extents , and this may be at least partially due to the different actin filament binding interfaces of the two Tpm isoforms . DISCUSSION Different non - muscle Tpm isoforms have distinct cellular functions , and they provide specific functional features to the actin filaments ( Gunning et al . , 2015a ) . However , the underlying structural principles have remained unknown . Moreover , the molecular basis by which different Tpm isoforms segregate to different actin filaments in vitro ( Gateva et al . , 2017 ) has remained elusive . Cryo - EM and biochemical experiments on non - muscle β / γ - actin filaments decorated by two non - muscle Tpm isoforms allowed us to probe the mechanisms underlying their specific functions . Most importantly , we revealed that while Tpm1 . 6 and Tpm3 . 2 binding leaves the actin conformation unaltered , they follow different paths along the major groove of the actin filament . We speculate that this property of Tpm contributes to their different biochemical functions and specific role in cells . The different positioning of Tpm1 . 6 and Tpm3 . 2 along the actin filament provides a plausible explanation for why these two Tpm isoforms cannot co - polymerize with each other on actin filaments . This is because the heterotypic juxtaposition of Tpm1 . 6 and Tpm3 . 2 on an actin filament shows that neither the phase of the a - helices , nor their positions match with those of the a - helices in the adjacent tropomyosin coiled - coil . Therefore , whereas the N - and C - termini of Tpm dimers of the same isoform can generate proper head - to - tail oligomers , the N - and C - termini of Tpm1 . 6 and Tpm3 . 2 isoforms are out of the registry for head - to - tail interactions . In addition to these geometrical factors , also sequence - specific interactions between Tpm N - and C - termini contribute to their co - polymerization on actin filaments . However , because the C - terminal regions of Tpm1 . 6 and Tpm3 . 2 are nearly identical to each other , and for example much more similar than the ones between Tpm1 . 1 and Tpm1 . 6 ( Fig . S1 ) , we speculate that in the case of Tpm1 . 6 and Tpm3 . 2 the lack of isoform mixing must result mainly from their different positioning along the actin filament . In the future , it will be interesting to examine if also other most abundant non - muscle Tpm isoforms are ‘out of register’ with each other on an actin filament , as well as to study the specific roles of N - and C - terminal sequences of Tpms in their co - polymerization . Earlier biochemical studies provided evidence that Tpm1 . 6 displays a 9 much more stable association with actin filaments in vitro compared to Tpm3 . 2 ( Gateva et al . , 2017 ) . This may be partially due to the presence of seven actin - binding sites in Tpm1 . 6 vs . six such sites in Tpm3 . 2 . Additionally , Tpm1 . 6 occupies the ’A - state’ position on an actin filament , whereas Tpm3 . 2 is shifted towards the M - state position , which at least in the case of muscle Tpm is energetically unfavorable . Because the central regions of Tpm1 . 6 and Tpm3 . 2 are highly conserved between each other and with muscle Tpm1 . 1 ( Fig . S1 ) , it is likely that the variable regions adjacent to N - and C - termini are responsible for the different positioning of Tpm1 . 6 and Tpm3 . 2 on the actin filament . Moreover , possible differences in the head - to - tail interactions may be responsible for the slow off - rate of Tpm1 . 6 from actin filaments as compared to the relatively dynamic association of Tpm3 . 2 with actin filaments . It is also important to note that our work , as well as earlier biochemical studies , were performed using Tpms produced in E . coli . These Tpms contain an acetylation - mimic Met - Ala - Ser sequence in the N - terminus . Tpms purified from mammalian cells that harbor native post - translational modifications , however , display slightly different affinities on actin filaments ( Carman et al . , 2021 ) . Thus , also the dynamics of native Tpms on actin filaments may exhibit small differences from the ones produced in E . coli . Our study sheds light on the different effects of Tpm1 . 6 and Tpm3 . 2 isoforms on ADF / cofilin and myosin II . We propose that , due to the larger overlap between Tpm1 . 6 and ADF / cofilin on actin filament , as compared to Tpm3 . 2 and ADF / cofilin , Tpm1 . 6 prevents more efficiently ADF / cofilin - binding to actin filament ( Fig . 5 ) . This could explain why Tpm1 . 6 protects actin filaments more efficiently from ADF / cofilin - mediated disassembly as compared to Tpm3 . 2 ( Gateva et al . , 2017 ) . On the other hand , myosin II motor domain appears to bind both Tpm1 . 6 - decorated and Tpm3 . 2 - decorated actin filaments with similar affinity ( Fig . S5 ) , despite the fact that there seems to be a larger overlap between myosin and Tpm1 . 6 than between myosin and Tpm3 . 2 on an actin filament ( Fig . 5 ) . Thus , we propose that the differences in actin - mediated activation of myosin II ATPase activity between Tpm1 . 6 and Tpm3 . 2 - decorated actin filaments are not due to their different binding sites along actin filaments , but rather result from sequence - specific interactions between Tpm3 . 2 and myosin II motor domain that enhance ATPase activation of the myosin . This is also supported by earlier work demonstrating that myosin - binding can shift muscle Tpms to a different position on the actin filament ( Behrmann et al . , 2012 ; Risi et al . , 2021 ; Von der Ecken et al . , 2015 ) . In conclusion , our work suggests that both the positioning of the Tpm isoform on actin filament , as well as sequence - specific interactions between Tpms and other actin - binding proteins , contribute to specific functions of different Tpm isoforms . In this context , it is important to note that non - muscle Tpms have so far been studied only in the context of a handful of actin - binding proteins , but they are likely to also control the activities of a large array of other actin - binding proteins , including the many members of the myosin family . Thus , more work is required to understand how non - muscle Tpms regulate the interactions with various cytoskeletal proteins with actin filaments . Moreover , it will be important to determine 10 the structures of other non - muscle actin – Tpm filaments and uncover the molecular basis of their distinct biological and biochemical activities . Finally , it will be interesting to determine the high - resolution structures of native non - muscle Tpms to uncover the precise mechanisms by which properly post - translationally modified Tpms form head - to - tail interactions on actin filaments . 11 Table 1 .

Non - tagged Tpms were purified as per a published method ( Janco et al . , 2016 ) . Briefly , non - tagged Tpm constructs were expressed in E . coli BL21 - DE3 bacterial expression system in 1 L Luria Bertani broth ( 2X ) containing ampicillin ( 100 µg / ml ) and was grown until the O . D 600 reached 0 . 7 – 0 . 8 . The grown culture was further induced with 1 mM IPTG final concentration at 37 o C for 3 h . Cells expressing untagged Tpms were harvested by centrifugation ( 4000 ´ g , 4 o C , 15 min , JS 4 . 2 rotor , J6 - MI centrifuge , Beckman Coulter ) and resuspended in lysis buffer ( 20 mM Na 2 PO 4 , 500 mM NaCl , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT and 1 ´ protease inhibitor cocktail ) . The cells were lysed thoroughly by sonicating on ice ( 4 ´ 30s ) until the bacterial suspension turned comparatively transparent . The cell lysate was heated in a water bath set at 80 o C for 8 min . The heat - treated lysate was cooled to room temperature in a water bath . The supernatant containing Tpms was cleared from denatured proteins and cell debris by centrifugation at 47 , 810 ´ g , 4 o C for 45 min ( F21S - 8x50 rotor , Sorvall LYNX 4000 , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . Tpms were acid precipitated from the supernatant at pH 4 . 7 using 2 M HCl . The precipitated materials containing Tpms was centrifuged at 3900 ´ g , 4 o C for 12 min ( F21S - 8x50 rotor , Sorvall LYNX 4000 , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . The pellet was resuspended in a resuspension buffer ( 100 mM Tris - Cl pH 7 . 5 , 500 mM NaCl , 5 mM MgCl2 , 1 mM DTT , 1 mM NaN3 ) . To dissolve the pellet completely , the buffer was readjusted to pH 7 . 0 using 1 M NaOH . The acid precipitation was repeated two more times to remove impurities and to obtain a white pellet . The pellet was resuspended in the resuspension buffer and filtered using a 0 . 22 - µm membrane filter . Dialysis was performed overnight in a dialysis buffer ( 20 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 5 , 500 mM NaCl , 0 . 5 mM DTT ) using a 10 - kDa molecular cutoff membrane ( # 88243 , SnakeSkin TM Dialysis Tubing , 10MWCO , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . The next day , a 4 - ml SP QFF anion exchange column was equilibrated with 4 column volumes of anion exchange wash buffer ( 20 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 5 , 10 mM NaCl , 0 . 5 mM DTT ) and the supernatant was loaded onto the column at 2 ml / min loading speed . The column was washed with 4 column volumes of wash buffer . The column was further equilibrated with anion exchange elution buffer ( 20 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 1 M NaCl , 0 . 5 mM DTT ) and Tpm was collected in the flow through . Samples from peak fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS - PAGE based on which the fractions were pooled together . The pooled fraction was diluted 4 times with hydroxyapatite wash buffer ( 10 mM Na 2 PO 4 pH 7 . 0 , 1M NaCl , 0 . 5 mM DTT ) and loaded onto an equilibrated hydroxyapatite column with 0 . 5 ml / min loading speed . The column was washed with 4 column volumes of hydroxyapatite wash buffer and the protein was eluted in a 10 mM to 240 mM phosphate gradient against hydroxyapatite elution buffer ( 240 mM Na 2 PO 4 pH 7 . 0 , 1 M NaCl , 0 . 5 mM DTT ) . The eluted fractions were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and the fractions containing Tpm protein were pooled together . The acidification procedure was repeated twice to obtain pure protein . The precipitate was pelleted at 3900 ´ g , 4 o C for 12 min . The pellet was resuspended in dialysis buffer ( 20 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 0 , 100 mM KCl , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 0 . 02 % NaN 3 ) and dialyzed overnight at 4 o C . The supernatant containing pure protein was concentrated using 30 MWCO column concentrator ( Amicon ® Ultra - 15 , Merck Millipore ) . Purified protein concentration was measured using spectrophotometer ( NanoDrop® ND - 1000 spectrophotometer , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) , fluorimetry and densitometry methods . The protein aliquots 14 were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at – 80 o C . The His - tagged sfGFP and mCherry fused tropomyosin and Cofilin - 1 constructs were expressed in E . coli BL - 21 ( DE3 ) cells in 1 L auto - induction media at 37 o C till O . D 600 reached 0 . 7 – 0 . 8 after which the cells were induced at 28 o C for 24 h . The cells were harvested by centrifugation at ( 4000 ´ g , 4 o C , 15 min , JS 4 . 2 rotor , J6 - MI centrifuge , Beckman Coulter ) and resuspended in Ni - NTA binding buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 5 , 300 mM NaCl , 10 mM imidazole , 1 mM DTT ) and 1 ´ protease inhibitor cocktail . Cells were lysed by sonication and cell debris was pelleted at 4000 ´ g , 4 o C for 15 min ( JS 4 . 2 rotor , J6 - MI centrifuge , Beckman Coulter ) . The his - tagged Tpm1 . 6 and Tpm3 . 2 were purified with Ni - NTA agarose beads ( Qiagen ) as per the manufacturer’s protocol . Ni - NTA agarose beads were first washed 2 times with Ni - binding buffer and centrifuged at 3000 ´ g , 4 o C for 5 min and the beads were suspended in equal volume of binding buffer . The Ni - NTA beads were incubated with the supernatant containing His - tagged fusion Tpm and mixed on an orbital shaker at 4 o C , 1 h . The beads were loaded on a plastic column and washed extensively with low salt and high salt binding buffer and eluted in elution buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 5 , 300 mM NaCl , 250 mM imidazole , 1 mM DTT ) . The wash and eluted fractions were analyzed by SDS - PAGE . The elutes were dialyzed in dialysis buffer ( 10 mM HEPES pH 8 . 0 , 20 mM NaCl , 1 mM DTT ) , overnight at 4 o C . The supernatant was concentrated and was purified by gel filtration against gel filtration buffer with high salt ( 10 mM HEPES pH 8 . 0 , 500 mM NaCl , 1 mM DTT ) . The peak fractions were analyzed by SDS - PAGE , pooled together and concentrated . The protein concentration was measured by fluorimetry , and the aliquots were flash frozen and stored at – 80 o C . Co - sedimentation assays Actin co - sedimentation assays were performed as previously reported with few modifications ( Doran et al . , 2020 ) . Non - muscle actin ( β / γ - actin from human platelets ) and myosin motor protein ( S1 fragment ) were procured from Cytosleleton Inc . and were resuspended in distilled water and stored at – 80 o C as per the manufacturer’s instructions . For competition assays , different amounts of either β / γ - actin or β / γ - actin and non - tagged Tpm1 . 6 or Tpm3 . 2 were mixed in presence of G - buffer ( 5 mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM DTT and 0 . 2 mM ATP ) . To completely saturate Tpm binding site on non - muscle actin filaments , actin and Tpm1 . 6 or Tpm3 . 2 were mixed in 4 : 1 ratio . Actin / actin : Tpm were pre - polymerized by addition of F - buffer containing 20 mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 , 100 mM KCl , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM EGTA , 1 mM DTT and 0 . 2 mM ATP final concentration at room temperature for 30 min . One µM of myosin motor protein was added to the polymerized actin / actin : Tpm complex and was incubated at room temperature for 30 min . Actin : Tpm : myosin motor protein complex was sedimented by centrifugation at 59000 rpm for 60 min at 10 o C ( TLA100 rotor , Beckman Optima MAX Ultracentrifuge ) . Supernatant and pellet fractions were separated , and samples were prepared for SDS - PAGE analysis by cooking in Laemmli Buffer at 100 o C for 5 min . Supernatant and pellets were run on 4 – 20 % gradient SDS - PAGE gels in equal proportions ( Mini - PROTEAN TGX Precast Gels , Bio - Rad Laboratories Inc . ) . The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue staining solution ( QC Colloidal Coomassie Stain , Biorad Laboratories , Inc . ) . The intensities of myosin motor protein bands was quantified with QuantityOne program ( Bio - Rad ) , analyzed and plotted as amount of myosin motor protein in pellet ( μM ) to actin / actin : Tpm1 . 6 / actin : Tpm3 . 2 . Myosin ATPase assay The steady - state ATPase activity of skeletal muscle myosin motor protein was measured 15 using EnzChek® Phosphate Assay Kit ( Molecular probes , Inc . ) as per the manufacturer’s instructions . Before polymerization , β / γ - actin and Tpms were mixed in 4 : 1 ratio and preincubated in G - buffer ( 5 mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 , 0 . 2 mM CaCl2 , 0 . 2 mM DTT and 0 . 2 mM ATP ) . β / γ - actin : Tpm reactions were prepared with and without the addition of myosin motor protein . In the reaction containing myosin motor protein , β / γ - actin : Tpms were mixed with myosin motor protein in 10 : 1 ratio . The polymerization of β / γ - actin and β / γ - actin : Tpms was initiated using F - buffer ( 20 mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 , 100 mM KCl , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM EGTA , 1 mM DTT and 0 . 2 mM ATP final concentration ) at room temperature for 30 min . ATPase assay reaction mix was prepared by adding distilled water , actin - polymerization buffer , 0 . 2 µM substrate 2 - amino - 6 - mercapto - 7 - methylpurine riboside ( MESG ) , 1 U purine nucleoside phosphorylase ( PEP ) , 0 . 6 µM myosin motor protein and incubated for 10 min at room temperature . The mix was transferred to a 96 - well microreader plate . The reaction was started by adding 6 µM actin / actin : Tpm , mixed properly and the measurement was started without delay at 340 nm in a microplate reader at room temperature . All combinations were tested with and without the addition of myosin motor protein , Tpm1 . 6 and Tpm3 . 2 . The myosin ATPase rate was calculated by the change in absorbance in presence of bare actin filaments and actin filaments decorated with Tpm1 . 6 or Tpm3 . 2 and plotted using GraphPad Prism 7 software . The data was analyzed for significance by one - way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s HSD post - hoc analysis . In - vitro TIRF microscopy The TIRF chamber was pre - treated with 1 . 5 % BSA for 1 h in a humidified chamber . β / γ - actin , sfGFP - fused Tpm1 . 6 , Tpm3 . 2 and mCherry - fused Cofilin - 1 were diluted in G - buffer containing 5 mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM DTT and 0 . 2 mM ATP . For polymerization 0 . 8 µM β / γ - actin was mixed with 1 . 2 µM sfGFP - Tpm1 . 6 and 2 . 4 µM sfGFP - Tpm3 . 2 in F - buffer ( 10 mM HEPES pH 7 . 0 , 50 mM Na - acetate , 3 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT and 0 . 2 mM ATP ) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min . 1 . 2 µM of mCherry - cofilin - 1 was added to the reaction , followed by 1 % methylcellulose final concentration . The reaction was mixed and injected into the BSA pre - treated TIRF chamber . The imaging was started immediately without any delay . TIRF imaging was performed using ONI Nanoimager equipped with 100 ´ Apo TIRF 1 . 49 NA oil objective , 1000 - mW 561 - nm and 1000 - mW 640 - nm lasers , sCmos camera and NimOS software . The time - lapse images were captured for 30 min with 10 s interval using 3 % green and red laser power at 100 fps speed . The time lapse images were analyzed by Fiji image J software . Only single actin : Tpm filaments were measured during the analysis . The growth of cofilin - 1 segments in 30 min was analyzed by measuring the length of cofilin - 1 segments at the first and the last frame of imaging and subtracting the length obtained at first frame from the last one . Thus , the rate of cofilin - 1 extension on Tpm1 . 6 and Tpm3 . 2 decorated actin filaments was obtained by dividing the cofilin - 1 segments by imaging time ( 30 min ) . Cryo - EM sample preparation , data collection and image processing To dissolve the oligomers that form during the storage , 50 µM β / γ - actin was mixed in G - buffer ( 5 mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM DTT , 0 . 2 mM ATP ) , and incubated at room temperature for at least 30 min . To ensure complete saturation of actin filaments with Tpm , a 1 : 1 . 5 ratio of β / γ - actin : Tpm1 . 6 and Tpm3 . 2 was used for the sample preparation . β / γ - actin ( 12 . 5 µM ) was mixed to F - buffer ( 10 mM HEPES pH 7 . 0 , 50 mM Na - acetate , 3 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT and 0 . 2 mM ATP ) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min to allow formation of actin filaments . Either Tpm1 . 6 16 ( 9 µM ) or Tpm3 . 2 ( 9 µM ) was added , mixed gently , and incubated further for 1 h at room temperature . The actin : Tpm complex was pelleted by centrifugation at 59 , 000 rpm for 1 h at 10 o C ( TLA100 rotor , Beckman Optima MAX Ultracentrifuge ) . The supernatant was discarded and fresh F - buffer containing 0 . 02 % NaN 3 was added to the pellet before incubating it overnight for the pellet to solubilize . A 3 - µ l aliquot of the actin - Tpm sample was applied onto a glow discharged holey carbon copper grid ( Quantifoil R1 . 2 / 1 . 3 ) and allowed to settle for 15 seconds . The grids were prepared using a vitrification apparatus ( Vitrobot , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) operated at a relative humidity of 95 % and at 6°C . Grids were blotted for 5 s with filter paper prior to plunging into liquid ethane . The grids were stored in liquid nitrogen for subsequent screening and imaging . Data were acquired using a transmission electron microscope ( Talos Arctica , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) equipped with Falcon III direct electron detector ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . Movies of 45 frames were collected with a total electron exposure of 45 e – / Å 2 , with a defocus ranging from 1 to 3 µ m . A total of 1 , 758 movies were recorded for Tpm1 . 6 and 1 , 273 movies for Tpm3 . 2 complex . The movies were then imported to RELION for data processing . The movies were aligned and summed using MotionCorr ( Zheng et al . , 2017 ) . CTF was estimated using CTFFIND4 ( Rohou and Grigorieff , 2015 ) . Filaments were manually picked to generate a template for automated picking using 2D classification in RELION ( Zivanov et al . , 2018 ) . Class averages showing Tpm - decorated filaments were used as templates and filaments were picked automatically using a helical rise of 27 . 5 Å and a width of 100 Å . Overlapping filament segments were extracted in 400 ´ 400 - pixel boxes and subjected to reference - free 2D classification . Segments corresponding to classes representing bare actin were discarded and the remaining segments were subjected to two rounds of 2D classification . This resulted in 118 , 164 segments for Tpm1 . 6 and 100 , 804 segments for Tpm3 . 2 . An ab initio model was generated for both datasets in RELION . Using this model as a reference , the filament segments were subjected to 3D classification applying helical symmetry . Particles corresponding to 3D class averages displaying Tpm decoration were selected . This resulted in 79 , 298 segments for Tpm1 . 6 and 81 , 431 segments for Tpm3 . 2 . The segments were subjected to 3D reconstruction , using one of the 3D class averages as a reference . Helical symmetry was used during refinement and was allowed to explore the range from – 161 to – 170 degrees of rotation and a rise from 22 to 30 Å . After particle polishing , CTF refinement , and postprocessing , the final resolution was 3 . 9 Å for Tpm1 . 6 and 4 . 5Å for Tpm3 . 2 complex , as estimated by Fourier shell correlation ( FSC = 0 . 143 ) . For visualizing the entire length of the actin filament corresponding to Tpms , the map was averaged in real space in a 512 ´ 512 - pixel box by applying helical symmetry in RELION . Atomic model building and molecular modelling A comparative model was created for β - actin in SWISS - MODEL ( Waterhouse et al . , 2018 ) using a fiber actin structure ( PDB : 5JLF ) as a template . The resulting structure was fitted into the actin : Tpm cryo - EM density maps as a rigid body using UCSF ChimeraX ( Pettersen et al . , 2021 ) . The structure was manually adjusted in Coot ( Casañal et al . , 2020 ) and in ISOLDE ( Croll , 2018 ) . Symmetry copies ( 8 chains in total ) were generated in ChimeraX by rigid body fitting . A poly - alanine model ( 135 residues , from PDB : 3J8A ) of Tpm was fitted into the density maps filtered to 7 Å resolution as a rigid body in ChimeraX and refined in ISOLDE in the same density maps using secondary structure restraints . The Tpm models were combined with their respective actin models and the combined 17 models were refined in real space in Phenix ( Afonine et al . , 2018 ) against the unfiltered maps , using the parameters created in ISOLDE with command isolde write phenixRsrInput with added non - crystallographic symmetry constraints . Structures were validated using Phenix and MolProbity ( Williams et al . , 2018 ) . Figures were made using ChimeraX . Modeling of the actin : Tpm interfaces was carried out using a combination of AlphaFold structure prediction ( Jumper et al . , 2021 ) and Rosetta all - atom refinement ( Song et al . , 2013 ; Wang et al . , 2016 ) . For each actin filament , the model was first refined symmetrically into the corresponding cryo - EM density map . These refined actin filament models were then used in the subsequent modeling of Tpms . To identify the contacts between the Tpm and actin interface , the following procedure was performed on both Tpm1 . 6 and Tpm3 . 2 : 1 . Prediction of the Tpm coiled - coil by AlphaFold : A model of the coiled - coil alone was predicted by AlphaFold , using Tpm monomer multiple sequence alignments with a depth of over 2000 sequences . Five models from AlphaFold were minimized in Rosetta using the Relax protocol ( Conway et al . , 2014 ) and the lowest - scoring model was chosen . For both sequences , the final model had at least 85 % residues with a confidence estimate ( pLDDT ) greater than 70 . Predicted alignment error ( PAE ) was less than 5 Å for at least 60 % of contacts made across the interface of the coiled - coil . 2 . Identification of favorable actin – Tpm interfaces : We first identified favorable interactions of actin and Tpm by modeling the energetics of a small piece of Tpm ( approximately 45 residues from each Tpm chain ) interacting with a single actin monomer . We considered all sequence registrations onto this helix that maintained the predicted coiled - coil interface , by first shifting the helices “up” by one turn ( equivalent to a 3 . 5 - residue shift ) , and then by rethreading the model offset by 7 residues ( equivalent to a shift of one heptad repeat ) . Each model was refined with Rosetta’s Relax function . 3 . Determination of the full - length actin – Tpm interface : We translated the full - length Tpm model in relation to the actin filament in steps corresponding to one helical turn ( approximately 5 . 5 Å ) and refined the resulting model . Refinement involved a two - step procedure . Since the predicted Tpm models showed different curvature than was indicated by the density , we first refined Tpm in isolation ( with Rosetta’s Relax ) using fit - to - density as well as constraints from the interfaces determined in step 2 . Next , we refined the full actin : Tpm complex , using the fit - to - density function without any other constraints ( again using Relax ) . In this step , only actin residues within 8 Å of Tpm were permitted to move . For this latter step , five independent trajectories were run . For each position , the interface energies were calculated using the ddG application in Rosetta ( Fig . S5 ) . 4 . Final refinement of full actin : Tpm complex : The model from step 3 with the lowest interface energy was refined using Rosetta’s LocalRelax protocol ( Wang et al . , 2016 ) . Twenty models were generated , and the lowest energy model was selected , using Rosetta’s force field augmented with the “fit to density” score term . 18 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We thank Pasi Laurinmäki and Benita Löflund for technical assistance in cryo - EM .

Cryo - EM structures of actin / non - muscle tropomyosin complexes . ( A ) Cryo - EM density of actin : Tpm1 . 6 complex is shown . Actin plus ( barbed ) and minus ( pointed ) ends are labelled . The density has been segmented and actin subunits are colored individually . The Tpm1 . 6 density has been filtered to 7 - Å resolution . ( B ) A close - up of the area indicated in A is shown . Tmp1 . 6 density is shown as a transparent surface . Those parts of the actin surface that reside at 10 Å distance or closer to the Tpm1 . 6 have been colored in gray . ( C ) The same view as in b is shown for actin : Tpm3 . 2 complex . ( D ) A close - up of the area highlighted in B is shown rotated as indicated . The actin model is shown as a ribbon , the ADP model is shown as a surface , and the Tpm1 . 6 density as a transparent surface . The different sub - domains of actin are labelled 1 – 4 . ( E ) The same view as in d is shown for actin Tpm3 . 2 complex . Tpm3 . 2 is shifted slightly in its position relative to the Tpm1 . 6 density in D . 24 25 Figure 2 . Models of the actin / non - muscle tropomyosin binding sites . ( A ) An atomic model of actin from actin : Tpm1 . 6 complex is shown as a ribbon . The different sub - domains of actin are labeled 1 – 4 . The helix - and - loop motif shown in close - up in B and C is in blue . ( B ) Models of the binding sites between six actins and a single Tpm3 . 2 coiled - coil are shown . The two alpha - helices of the coiled - coil are labelled A and B . Sidechains are shown for actin residues D311 , K326 , and K328 . Sidechains are also shown for those Tpm3 . 2 residues that are at hydrogen bonding distance . Hydrogen bonds predicted by the model are shown with dashed lines ( cyan ) . ( C ) The same rendering as in B is shown for seven actins and Tpm1 . 6 . Please not that one of the interactions is absent in Tpm3 . 2 due to its shorter length . 26 Figure 3 . Visualisations of the tropomyosin ends . ( A , B ) Placement of two consecutive tropomyosins of the same kind ( homotypic placement ) are shown for Tpm1 . 6 ( panel A ) and for Tpm3 . 2 ( panel B ) . ( C , D ) Placement of two consecutive tropomyosins of the different kinds ( heterotypic placement ) are shown . In all panels the two a - helices of the tropomyosin coiled - coil are labelled with A and B . The helices in the adjacent coiled - coil are labelled with A’ and B’ . In all cases a conformational change in the Tpm ends would be required to allow binding of the next coiled - coil in the filament to avoid overlap . However , in the heterotypic complexes neither the phase of the a - helices , nor their position matches those of the a - helices in the adjacent coiled - coil . 27 Figure 4 . Comparison of the tropomyosin positions on the actin filament . ( A – D ) The position of Tpm1 . 6 in A ( A - state ) is compared to muscle tropomyosin in B ( A - state ) , Tpm3 . 2 in C ( A’ - state ) , and to the one muscle tropomyosin from myosin bound ( not shown ) structure in D ( M - state ) . The shifts and rotations shown indicate the measured transformations taking the tropomyosin coiled - coils in B – D on the reference coiled - coil in A . 28 29 Figure 5 .

White and yellow arrowheads indicate individual actin filaments and actin filament bundles , respectively . Tpm1 . 6 - decorated actin filaments show less binding of cofilin - 1 as compared to Tpm3 . 2 decorated filaments at 30 min time point . ( E ) The scatter plots show the proportion of cofilin - 1 decoration on actin filaments in the presence of Tpm3 . 2 and Tpm1 . 6 at 30 min timepoint . Middle horizontal line = mean ± S . D from N = 40 ( Tpm3 . 2 from three technical repeats ) and N = 23 ( Tpm1 . 6 from four technical repeats ) . The statistical significance between the groups was determined by using unpaired t - test with Welch’s correction . 30 SUPPLEMENTARY FIGURES Supplementary Figure S1 . Amino acid sequences of muscle Tpm1 . 1 and non - muscle Tpm1 . 6 and Tmp3 . 2 . The exon structures are shown below each sequence .
