However , it remains unclear , how membrane deformation and endocytic 21 internalization are mechanistically linked . Here we show that many lipid - binding virions induce membrane 22 deformation and clathrin - independent endocytosis , suggesting a common mechanism based on multivalent 23 lipid binding by globular particles . We create a synthetic cellular system consisting of a lipid - anchored 24 receptor in the form of GPI - anchored anti - GFP nanobodies and a multivalent globular binder exposing 180 25 regularly - spaced GFP molecules on its surface . We show that these globular , 40 nm diameter , particles bind 26 to cells expressing the receptor , deform the plasma membrane upon adhesion and become endocytosed in 27 a clathrin - independent manner . We explore the role of the membrane adhesion energy in endocytosis by 28 using receptors with affinities varying over 7 orders of magnitude . Using this system , we find that once a 29 threshold in adhesion energy is overcome to allow for membrane deformation , endocytosis occurs reliably . 30 Multivalent , binding - induced membrane deformation by globular binders is thus sufficient for 31 internalization to occur and we suggest it is the common , purely biophysical mechanism for lipid - binding 32 mediated endocytosis of toxins and pathogens . 33 34 35 Main 1 Endocytosis can occur either through a clathrin - mediated process ( CME ) 1 , 2 or in a clathrin - independent 2 manner ( CIE ) 3 , 4 . Regardless of the mechanism , the first step involves the deformation of the plasma 3 membrane into a nanoscale invagination that buds into a vesicle . For this to occur , the stiffness of the 4 membrane must be overcome 5 , 6 . In CME , the energy required to deform the membrane into an endocytic 5 pit stems from active and passive processes in a complex sequence of events . The clathrin - coated pit that 6 is formed in this process stabilizes the budding vesicle by the consumption of energy released by clathrin 7 assembly 7 – 13 . Clathrin - independent endocytosis by definition does not include this process and many 8 molecules internalized by such pathways are capable of deforming membranes by themselves 14 – 16 . Indeed 9 several cargoes that bind multivalently to glycolipids such as Galectin3 17 , the Cholera toxin beta subunit 10 ( CTxB ) 15 , 18 , the Shiga toxin 14 and Simian Virus 40 ( SV40 15 ) can deform membranes in vitro and in energy - 11 depleted cells . This membrane deformation seems to be dependent on the presence of several binding sites 12 in close proximity , since antibodies to glycolipids 15 or a CTxB mutant , in which all but one binding sites 13 are mutated 19 , 20 , cannot deform membranes . Furthermore , globular glycolipid binders such as SV40 can 14 deform even stiff membranes , that CTxB cannot deform , by imprinting their ~ 45 nm diameter shape on 15 the plasma membrane of host cells 15 . This suggests that an interplay between particle shape and adhesion 16 energy applied from several binding sites in a nanoscopic domain may provide a common biophysical 17 mechanism for membrane deformation and endocytosis . However , no tractable experimental system to test 18 the role of adhesion energy in such a model is available . 19 Here , we reconstitute an artificial ligand - receptor system that consists of a 40 nm diameter , polyvalent 20 globular binder and lipidic receptors in cells . Specifically , we use a polymerized capsid studded with 180 21 GFP molecules and anti - GFP nanobodies on GPI - anchors as receptors . In our system , particles deform 22 cellular membranes and become endocytosed in a clathrin - independent manner . When we modified the 23 adhesion energy forced upon membranes by particles by changing receptor affinity from 36 pM to 23 mM , 24 we found that a specific adhesion energy threshold was required for membrane deformation and 25 endocytosis . Our findings provide a simple mechanism that may explain how many bacterial toxins and 26 viruses exploit multivalent lipid binding for internalization . 27 Results 28 Membrane deformation after polyvalent lipid binding is a common mechanism of viral endocytosis . 29 Our initial objective was to investigate whether a common mechanism for membrane deformation 30 and endocytosis for globular multivalent lipid - binding nanoscale particles exists . To do so , we made use of 31 virus - like particles assembled from non - enveloped , ~ 45 nm diameter lipid - binding viruses . 32 1 Figure 1 .

Scale bars are 5 µm and 1 µm for insets . Magenta : VLPs , Cyan : membrane marker 16 or Lamp1 - EGFP . 17 Specifically , we generated VLPs of Simian Virus 40 ( SV40 ) , murine polyomavirus ( mPy ) and JC 1 Virus ( JCV ) , which bind to the gangliosides GM1 ( SV40 21 ) , GD1a or GT1b ( mPy 21 – 23 ) and GD1b ( JCV 24 ) , 2 respectively . Particles were assembled from the respective ganglioside - binding coat protein VP1 only 3 ( Figure S1A ) and fluorescence labeled VLPs bound readily and in a monodisperse manner to cells ( Figure 4 S1B ) . When we added fluorescence - labeled VLPs to giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs ) containing the 5 respective receptor ganglioside , we found that all particles deformed the membrane bilayer into tubular 6 structures emanating into the lumen of the GUV ( Figure 1A and Figure S1C ) . When we then depleted cells 7 of energy by treatment with deoxy - glucose and sodium azide to disrupt active processes and added VLPs 8 to them , we found that when bound to cellular plasma membranes , VLPs likewise deformed them . 9 Membrane - bound VLPs induced the formation of tubular invaginations that were continuous with the 10 plasma membrane and extended into the cytosol for VLPs from all viruses ( Figure 1B ) . We concluded that 11 membrane deformation is a common feature for globular glycolipid - binding multivalent ligands . We next 12 asked , whether VLPs would become endocytosed . Our results demonstrate that they readily internalize 13 ( Figure S1D , E ) and accumulate in LAMP - 1 positive endosomal structures inside cells as shown before for 14 SV40 ( 25 and Figure 1D , E ) . Thus , the multivalent globular lipid - binding VLPs are all capable of deforming 15 artificial and cellular membranes and became internalized and trafficked through the endolysosomal 16 system , suggesting a common underlying principle based on lipid binding . 17 A polyvalent virus - like - particle - lipid receptor system for endocytosis . 18 We next aimed to determine if multivalent lipid binding alone may suffice for particles to become 19 endocytosed . To do so , we generated a synthetic particle - receptor system using a genetically encoded 20 nanoparticle ( GEM 26 ) bearing 180 copies of GFP on its surface . The GEMs self - assembled from monomers 21 of the encapsulin protein from the archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus 27 coupled to GFP when recombinantly 22 expressed in E . coli and formed ~ 40 nm diameter globular particles ( Figure 2A ) . We refer to these particles 23 from now on as GEMs and employ them as model for a nanoscale globular lipid binder . As receptor we 24 used anti - GFP nanobodies 28 incorporated into the plasma membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol 25 anchor ( GPI - anchor ) , ( Figure 2A ) . 26 Purified GEMs appeared as ~ 40 nm diameter monodisperse particles in transmission electron microscopy 27 and when added to cells expressing the receptor , bound as discrete fluorescent spots exhibiting lateral 28 motion ( Figure 2B and Video S1 ) . Binding was specific and could be blocked by the addition of free 29 nanobodies to the medium ( Figure S2A ) . When we generated Giant Plasma Membrane Vesicles ( GPMVs ) 30 from receptor - expressing cells , GEMs bound to them readily and , after a period of adhering to and 31 accumulating on the membrane , formed tubular invaginations emanating into the lumen of the GPMVs 32 ( Figure 2C ) . 33 1 Figure 2 .

Means ± S . D . for 6 cells 13 from n = 2 independent experiments . Scale bar is 50 nm . Overview images are provided in Figure S2 and Video S2 . 14 Moreover , when we depleted energy of the receptor - expressing cells using sodium azide / deoxy - glucose as 15 above , the GEMs were observed to induce membrane curvature in a similar manner to the deformation we 16 observed for glycolipid - binding virions ( Figure 2D ) . We concluded that GEMs could induce membrane 17 deformation in plasma membranes of cells . To probe whether membrane - bound GEMs colocalized with 18 known endocytic structures such as clathrin or caveolae , we added GEMs to live cells expressing clathrin - 19 light chain - DsRed or caveolin1 - mRFP and observed them in total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) 20 microscopy . We found that membrane - bound GEMs were virtually absent from clathrin - DsRed positive 21 areas and merely a small fraction colocalized with caveolin1 - mRFP ( Figure 2E , F ) . To identify a possible 22 early endocytic structure , we then performed correlative platinum - replica electron microscopy and confocal 23 fluorescence microscopy of unroofed cells 29 , 30 after GEM binding ( Figure 2G , Figure S2B , C and Video 24 S2 ) . We found that areas with bound GEMs exhibited small , irregularly shaped membrane structures that 25 were mostly devoid of the characteristic clathrin - coats or caveolar ribbon structures ( Figure 2G , H and 26 Figure S2B ) . We concluded that the GEMs were capable of deforming membranes into small invaginations 27 emanating from the plasma membrane into the cytosol in live cells independently of both clathrin and 28 caveolae . 29 When we imaged GEMs bound to cells for longer periods in live - cell microscopy , we observed that they 30 became trapped in bright structures that moved in a directed manner inside cells , suggesting that GEMs 31 became endocytosed into vesicular structures containing many particles . To investigate the identity of these 32 endocytic carrier vesicles , we employed Correlative Light Electron Microscopy ( CLEM ) to precisely 33 resolve the intracellular localization of the particles . To do so , we bound 5 µg / ml of GEMs to cells and 34 incubated them at 37˚C to allow for internalization and intracellular transport . We then performed high - 35 pressure - freezing on these cells after 1h or 6h incubation and performed cryogenic CLEM . When we 36 acquired low magnification correlative light - electron microscopy overviews of these cells ( Figure S3A ) , 37 we were able to pinpoint the precise localization of the GEMs inside the cells using their fluorescence 38 signal . 39 1 Figure 3 .

D ) 10 Quantification of colocalization between GEMs and Lamp1 - mRFP and between GEMs and Rab7 - mRFP from 11 timepoints indicated in C ) Means ± s . e . m . , n = 3 independent experiments . E ) Quantification of GEM endocytosis 12 upon treatment with genetic ( siRNA against clathrin - heavy - chain and expression of dominant negative Dyn2 - K44A ) 13 or chemical inhibitors ( Nystatin / Progesterone and BafilomycinA ) as compared to mock treatment . Mean fluorescence 14 intensity ± s . e . m was determined from flow cytometry measurements for at least 5000 cells / sample , n = 2 independent 15 experiments . 16 High - magnification transmission electron - tomograms of the intracellular compartments positive for GFP 1 signal revealed internalized GEMs as small dark particles of about 50 nm diameter ( Figure 3A , B and Video 2 S3 ) . GEMs were located to structures we could morphologically identify to be either endosomes or 3 lysosomes for both time points ( Figure 3A , B , Figure S3B ) . These results were consistent with observations 4 we made by live - cell microscopy on a spinning - disk confocal microscope where the GFP fluorescence of 5 the GEMs increasingly colocalized with that of Rab7 - mRFP and Lamp1 - mRFP in perinuclear vesicular 6 structures over several hours of endocytosis ( Figure 3C , D and Figure S3C ) . To test by what specific 7 mechanism GEMs became endocytosed , we developed a fluorescence - assisted cell sorting ( FACS ) based 8 internalization assay ( Figure S4A ) . To do so , we added 2 µg / ml of GEMs to cells and incubated them at 9 37˚C for 1 h . We then washed cells in acidic buffer , which efficiently removed surface - bound GEMS , but 10 not internalized particles ( Figure S4B ) , allowing us to quantify endocytosis . We then used our FACS - based 11 internalization assay with cells transfected with siRNA against clathrin - heavy chain ( CHC - KD ) and a 12 dominant negative construct of dynamin2 ( Dyn2 - K44A ) , which efficiently inhibits the scission of endocytic 13 vesicles by dynamin2 . Neither of these treatments inhibited GEM internalization , but both inhibited the 14 endocytosis of fluorescence - labelled transferrin , a marker for clathrin - mediated endocytosis , effectively 15 ( Figure 3E ) . We concluded that GEM endocytosis occurs independently of clathrin and dynamin in our 16 cells . To ask , whether GEM internalization was affected by the removal of membrane cholesterol , we 17 incubated cells with nystatin ( 25 µg / ml ) and progesterone ( 10 µg / ml ) , which effectively reduced SV40 18 internalization in our system ( Figure 3E ) , but did not inhibit GEM internalization . Similarly , the endosomal 19 acidification inhibitor BafilomycinA , which inhibits SV40 endocytosis 25 ( Figure 3E ) , did not inhibit GEM 20 internalization . We concluded that GEMs are not internalized by clathrin - mediated endocytosis or a 21 cholesterol - dependent endocytic pathway and that endosome acidification is not important in GEM 22 endocytosis . 23 Adhesion energy controls endocytosis . 24 Since we found that multivalent binding of our GEM via its surface GFP moieties to lipid - anchored 25 nanobodies was sufficient to allow adhesion , membrane deformation and endocytosis , we explored , 26 whether the affinity of the individual ligand - receptor interaction and thus the adhesion energy of the particle 27 to the membrane would be important in this process . To do so , we created 7 GPI - anchored anti - GFP 28 nanobodies with individual binding affinities increasing from the µM to the pM range ( Figure 4A ) . Their 29 successful incorporation into the extracellular leaflet of the plasma membrane of cells was verified by the 30 binding of recombinant EGFP to the membrane of transfected cells ( Figure S5A , C ) . Further , our GEM 31 particles bound to cells in an affinity - dependent manner , with binding levels close to background level for 32 the two lowest affinity nanobody constructs ( Figure S5A , B ) . 33 1 Figure 4 .

B ) Fluorescence micrographs of GEMs bound to GPMVs harvested from CV1 4 cells expressing the panel of GPI - anchored anti - GFP nanobody constructs as indicated and subsequently incubated 5 with 0 . 45 nM GEM - GFP particles for 1 h at RT before imaging at the equatorial plane on a spinning disk confocal 6 microscope . Scale bars are 2 µm . C ) Fluorescence micrographs of GEMs bound to energy - depleted CV - 1 cells 7 expressing the panel of GPI - anchored anti - GFP nanobodies .

D ) Quantification of GEM - GFP endocytosis as a function of receptor affinity as 12 determined by flow cytometry measurements of the mean cell - associated fluorescence after acid wash . Measured is 13 intensity of at least 5000 cells / sample , shown is means ± s . e . m . , n = 3 independent experiments . E ) Quantification of 14 GEM - GFP endocytosis as a function of receptor affinity and upon treatment with genetic ( siRNA against clathrin - 15 heavy - chain and expression of dominant negative Dyn2 - K44A ) or chemical inhibitors ( Nystatin / Progesterone and 16 BafilomycinA ) as compared to mock treatment controls ( Transferrin endocytosis for siRNA against CHC and 17 overexpression of DynK44A ; SV40 endocytosis for Nystatin / Progesterone and BafilomycinA ) . Endocytosis was 18 determined by flow cytometry measurements of the mean cell - associated fluorescence after acid wash . Measured is 19 intensity of at least 5000 cells / sample , shown is means ± s . e . m . , n = 2 independent experiments . 20 We next investigated whether the strength of the ligand - receptor interaction had an influence on 1 membrane curvature generation . When we added GEMs to GPMVs derived from cells expressing our panel 2 of nanobody receptors , we observed membrane tubulation occurring only for the five receptors with the 3 highest binding affinities ( Figure 4B ) , even though we observed GEMs to bind readily to GPMVs of lower 4 affinity as well . When we repeated these experiments in cells depleted of energy that likewise expressed 5 our panel of nanobody receptors , we found the same pattern ( Figure 4C ) . To our surprise , unlike for binding , 6 we noticed a yes or no pattern for membrane deformation both in cells and in GPMVs rather than a linear 7 increase with increasing affinity . It seemed that unlike binding , which was observed for all receptor 8 affinities by the GEMs , likely due to the multivalency resulting in high avidity , membrane deformation 9 rather followed a yes or no phenotype with a threshold at 600 nM ( Figure 4B , C ) . We then performed 10 endocytosis FACS assays in our cells for the entire panel of receptor affinities and found that both the 11 amount of internalized particles in cells as well as the amount of cells internalizing GEMs dropped with 12 decreasing affinity ( Figure 4 D , Figure S6 ) . Importantly , we noted a striking decrease for the two samples 13 with the lowest binding - affinity receptors , just like we had observed for membrane deformation , strongly 14 suggesting the existence of a threshold in the adhesion - energy necessary for the polyvalent globular binders 15 to efficiently internalize into cells . It seemed that once a threshold in adhesion - energy was met , particles 16 would deform membranes and become internalized . 17 To test , whether this striking change in endocytic capacity resulted from a pathway switch , we 18 investigated the colocalization of GEMs in all tested affinities for colocalization with clathrin light chain 19 and caveolin1 . We found uniformly low colocalization with both clathrin and caveolin1 , while we could 20 observe a slight increase in colocalization with caveolin1 with decreasing affinity ( Figure S7 ) . Furthermore , 21 we tested GEM endocytosis for all affinities in comparison to transferrin and SV40 for their susceptibility 22 to inhibitor treatment . Again , the knockdown of CHC and overexpression of dominant negative 23 dynamin2K44A significantly reduced the internalization of fluorescence - labeled transferrin , but not of 24 GEMs binding to any affinity receptor ( Figure 4E ) . Importantly , we controlled for the amount of surface 25 expressed transferrin receptor and GPI - anchored nanobody receptor upon CHC knockdown ( Figure S8 ) . 26 Finally , we tested , whether endocytosis was dependent on cholesterol or endosomal acidification for any 27 receptor affinity in comparison to SV40 and found that neither treatment with nystatin / progesterone for 28 cholesterol reduction nor inhibition of endosomal acidification by BafilomycinA , both of which reduced 29 SV40 endocytosis , did so for GEMs at any receptor affinity ( Figure 4E ) . 30 31 32 Theoretical modelling of adhesion - mediated curvature generation and tubulation . 1 We moved on to generate a physical model of the interaction of the GEMs with plasma membranes in 2 dependence of the receptor affinity to understand how the resulting change in adhesion energy may control 3 membrane deformation . The curvature generation and membrane tubulation induced by the globular GEMs 4 can be understood from the interplay of membrane bending and particle adhesion energies . The multivalent 5 binding of the GEMs leads to an effective adhesion potential 6 𝑉 ( 𝑙 ) = ∆𝐺 ( 𝑙 ) 𝐴 7 where ∆𝐺 ( 𝑙 ) is the binding free energy of a GFP - nanobody complex , and A is the membrane area per 8 complex . This binding free energy depends on the distance 𝑙 between the GEM surface and the membrane 9 ( Figure 5A , B ) , because GFP - nanobody binding is only possible for distances that are compatible with the 10 dimensions and anchoring flexibility of the protein complex . From the dimensions and linker attachment 11 sites of the GFP - nanobody complex , and from the flexibility of these linkers , which allow also for tilting 12 of the complex ( see Figure 5A , B ) , we estimate the adhesion potential as Gaussian function 31 13 𝑉 ( 𝑙 ) = −𝑈 exp [ − ( 𝑙 − 𝑙 0 ) 2 2𝜎⁄ ] 14 with preferred binding separation 𝑙 0 = 8 nm from particle surface to membrane midplane and a standard 15 deviation 𝜎 of 1 nm ( estimated as in Figure 5A ) . The depth of this potential is 16 𝑈 = 𝑘 𝐵 𝑇 𝐴 ln [ [ 𝑅 ] 𝜉𝐾 𝐷 ⁄ ] 17 where 𝑘 𝐵 𝑇 is the thermal energy , [ 𝑅 ] is the surface concentration of the nanobodies in the membrane , 𝐾 𝐷 18 is the dissociation constant of the soluble ( non - anchored ) complex , and 𝜉 is a “conversion length” from 3D 19 binding of the soluble complex to 2D binding of the anchored complex at preferred separation 𝑙 0 31 . Because 20 the radius of the GFP - free GEM scaffold particle is 15 nm 27 , the radius of a membrane vesicle wrapping a 21 single particle is r = 15 + 8 nm = 23 nm , and the vesicle area per protein complex is A = 4  r 2 / 180 = 37 22 nm 2 . 23 Particle wrapping becomes energetically favorable when the adhesion energy of wrapping increases to a 24 level above the cost of membrane bending 32 , 33 . We determined the sum of bending and adhesion energies 25 both for the wrapping of single particles ( Figure 5D , left ) , and for the joint wrapping of particles by 26 membrane tubules ( Figure 5D , right , see Methods ) . We find that this sum of energy is clearly lower for 27 joint particle wrapping , which explains the membrane tubulation observed for GEMs in GPMVs . The 28 calculated energy gain for the joint wrapping in tubules , compared to individual wrapping , is about 10 to 29 40 𝑘 𝐵 𝑇 per particle for the typical membrane bending rigidity  = 20 𝑘 𝐵 𝑇 34 ( Figure 5C ) . In Figure 5C , we 1 have assumed that the theoretical threshold U t = 2  / r 2 for wrapping 33 corresponds to a threshold value of 2 K D = 1000 nM for the tubulation in cell experiments ( see Table in Figure 5B ) , which results in the fit 3 parameter estimate [ 𝑅 ] 𝜉⁄ = 16300 nM . Below this threshold , particle wrapping is energetically unfavorable 4 and does not occur , above it , it does . 5 The energy gain of joint wrapping can be attributed to the membrane segments in between particles in the 6 membrane tubules . These membrane segments adopt nearly catenoidal shapes with low bending energy , 7 but still contribute to the overall adhesion energy for a sufficiently large range 𝜎 of the adhesion potential 8 V ( l ) compared to the membrane vesicle radius r 32 . The cooperative wrapping of spherical particles becomes 9 favourable , as a middle particle in the membrane tube will have two such boundary regions while a single 10 wrapped particle has only one boundary region ( Figure 5D ) . 11 12 Figure 5 .

Our system , 3 based on virus - like , icosahedral , genetically encoded multimeric particles ( GEMs ) and a portfolio of lipidic 4 receptors covering seven orders of magnitude of affinity , allowed us to directly ask : i ) how adhesion energy 5 influences the capability of particles to deform cellular membranes and ii ) if this is sufficient to induce 6 internalization into cells . We find that indeed a threshold adhesion energy exists for both membrane 7 deformation and endocytosis and strikingly , that this seems to be the same . We find that a K D of ~ 1 µM 8 allows for our GEMs to become internalized . The particles follow a clathrin - and dynamin - independent 9 pathway into the cell after forming early endocytic structures devoid of both clathrin and caveolin1 . They 10 then become transported through early endosomes to lysosomes in a bafilomycin - independent manner . 11 It has long been known that several multivalent lipid binders including viruses , bacterial toxins and lectins 12 are capable of mediating their internalization in a clathrin - independent manner . The unifying principle 13 behind clathrin - mediated endocytosis is clear . On the other hand , clathrin - independent processes remain 14 difficult to define 3 , 4 , 35 – 37 . We here reconstituted a synthetic cell biological model for endocytosis built on 15 GEM particles studded with 180 GFPs and anti - GFP nanobody receptors that are anchored in the plasma 16 membrane via a GPI - anchor . Using this reductionist approach , we could isolate the role of the affinity of 17 the receptor and thus the adhesion energy of the particle in membrane deformation and endocytosis . We 18 find a threshold adhesion energy for our GEMs that , when exceeded , leads to their internalization . It is thus 19 safe to assume that our observations are the result of an isolated biophysical mechanism . 20 Clearly , biophysical processes at membranes play important roles in cell biology , especially when it comes 21 to membrane shaping and deformation 5 , 6 , 35 , 36 , 38 – 42 . Furthermore , line tension and protein crowding can result 22 in membrane scission 43 , 44 . When we let GEMs bind to GPMVs or membranes of energy - depleted cells , we 23 found that they deformed membranes into tubular structures continuous with the bounding membrane , but 24 did not observe any vesicles inside GPMVs nor cells . In intact cells , we in contrast did not see membrane 25 tubules . GEMs rather formed small early - endocytic structures that seemed to vesiculate quickly after 26 membrane deformation . This supports a scission mechanism that depends on a cellular machinery rather 27 than a mechanism based purely on biophysical principles . We thus speculate that once the membrane wraps 28 around the ~ 40 nm diameter particle , this membrane invagination is recognized by the cell , recruiting 29 factors required for vesiculation , scission and transport to endosomes and lysosomes . One such factor may 30 be actin , as the assembly of actin - polymerizing molecules on artificial membranes can lead to abscission 31 and vesicle formation in in vitro assembled systems 3 , 45 and actin is known to be a central player in clathrin - 32 independent endocytosis 46 , 47 . BAR - domain proteins like endophilin likewise can mediate scission of 33 clathrin - independent carriers 48 – 51 . In the future it will thus be of great interest to identify the cellular factors 1 recruited to the highly curved early endocytic carriers that mediate vesicle scission and intracellular 2 transport to endosomes . These factors may be central to many uptake processes of lipid - binding particles . 3 Several molecular mechanisms to generate curvature on membranes and later endocytosis are known . 4 Lateral aggregation of proteins at membranes can lead to membrane deformation 52 and the formation of 5 protein condensates at membranes can do so as well 53 – 56 . The multivalent binding of SV40 57 can deform 6 membranes 15 , likewise bacterial toxins such as CTxB 14 – 16 , 18 and other , small or globular lipid binders 17 , 44 , 58 . 7 However , no tractable system exists that allows for a systematic investigation of the role of particle size , 8 receptor affinity or valency in membrane deformation . Our system of GEMs and lipid - linked nanobody 9 receptors offer such experimental control and could be extended further . On the one hand , GEMs exist in a 10 large variety of sizes and geometries 59 , presenting the opportunity to investigate the requirements to force 11 membranes into specific curvatures and to refine biophysical models 44 . On the other hand , the synthetic 12 nature of the GEMs together with our physical model allow for precise tuning of individual parameters . 13 The binding sites of the GEM , being GFP proteins attached through a linker , are flexible . The flexibility 14 requires high individual receptor affinities for membrane deformation . In contrast , the SV40 particle with 15 a stiff arrangement of binding sites requires merely low µM affinities in their lipidic receptors for membrane 16 deformation and internalization 15 , 57 , 60 , 61 . 17 In general , the globular SV40 and the likewise multivalent bacterial toxin CTxB belong to the best studied 18 multivalent lipid ligands for membrane deformation . Strikingly , the organization of binding sites in SV40 19 and CTxB are arranged in a very similar manner , and rearrangement of binding sites can lead to a loss of 20 membrane deformation capacity for CTxB 58 and other lectins 58 . This suggests a strong mechanistic role of 21 binding site geometry in membrane deformation and endocytosis , supporting the notion that nanoscopic 22 application of adhesion energy is required for membrane deformation . Our system of GFP - studded ligands 23 and lipid - anchored nanobody - receptors , besides creating globular binders of differing valency and size , 24 could be extended to pair small multivalent particles of controlled valency with receptors of controlled 25 affinity . Such a system would be especially powerful in in vitro reconstituted systems , where it would allow 26 for a comprehensive investigation of how binding - affinity , valency and geometry act together in membrane 27 deformation , lipid - mediated endocytosis and membrane domain formation in general 62 – 64 . This will allow 28 the field to overcome a bottleneck in tractable experimental systems to investigate fundamental biophysical 29 processes at membranes that control cellular function . 30 Acknowledgements 1 We thank Alexia de Caro , Helen Wildenauer , Gabriel Huerta Lopez and Aurora Elhazaz Fernandez for 2 testing reagents and performing initial test experiments .

Next , 2 μg / ml of either 30 VLPs or GEM - GFP were added to the cells and incubated further for 30 min at 4 °C to allow for protein 31 binding while endocytosis is inhibited . Then , cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in warm 1 medium supplemented with 10 mM HEPES . Cells were imaged live and right away corresponding to time 2 point t = 0 min . Afterwards , cells were placed at 37 °C and incubated for the respective amounts of time 3 before imaging live on a spinning disk confocal microscope . 4 Cellular energy starvation assay . 5 Cellular energy was depleted by incubating CV1 cells in PBS + + supplemented with 10 mM 2 - deoxy - D - 6 glucose and 10 mM NaN 3 for 30 min at 37 °C until residual ATP levels dropped to 2 . 1 % according to 7 previous findings 66 . Next , cells were incubated with at least 30 µg / ml of the specified VLPs or 2 nM of 8 GEM - GFP in energy - depletion medium for 1 h at 37 °C . In the last 10 min of incubation , 1 mg / ml of DiI 9 C12 membrane dye was added to the cells for the remaining time . Cells were then imaged live in energy - 10 depletion medium supplemented with 10 mM HEPES on a spinning disk confocal microscope . 11 Model membrane systems : Giant Unilamellar Vesicles . 12 GUVs were grown using the electroformation technique as previously described 67 . Lipid mixtures were 13 prepared in a methanol : chloroform solvent to 1 mg / ml final concentration . Next , 5 ul of the mix were spread 14 on each platinum wire of an in - house - built Pt electrode electroformation chamber . An electric current was 15 applied and vesicles were grown in a 300 mM sucrose solution for 1 hour at 10 Hz and 2 V at room 16 temperature . The alternating current was then decreased to 2 Hz and 2 V for another 30 min . Once the 17 electroformation procedure was completed , the GUV suspension was dropped onto coverslips that have 18 been pre - incubated with 1 mg / ml BSA solution and washed in PBS . GUVs were subsequently incubated 19 with 10 µg / ml of the specified VLPs for 1 hour at room temperature in VLP buffer ( 10 mM HEPES at pH 20 6 . 8 , 150 mM NaCl and 2 mM CaCl 2 ) and then imaged on a spinning disk confocal microscope . 21 Model membrane systems : Giant Plasma Membrane - derived Vesicles . 22 GPMVs were isolated from CV1 cells a by chemical vesiculant technique as previously described 68 . Briefly , 23 CV1 cells close to confluency were washed with PBS and incubated with 4 μg / ml of DiI C12 membrane 24 dye in PBS for 10 min at 37 °C . Cells were washed in PBS and resuspended in GPMV buffer ( 10 mM 25 HEPES , 150 mM NaCl , 2 mM CaCl 2 , pH 7 . 4 ) supplemented with 10 μM of the vesiculation agent 26 calmidazolium . After 2 h incubation at 37°C , the supernatant was transferred to an Eppendorf tube and 27 GPMVs were allowed to settle down for 30 min at RT . Finally , 200 μl of the GPMV solution was dropped 28 onto a 8 - well imaging chamber containing 200 μl of GPMV buffer . GPMVs were further incubated with 29 0 . 45 nM of GEM - GFP protein solution for 1 hour at RT and imaged on a spinning disk confocal microscope . 30 Western Blot 31 CV1 cells were transfected with the indicated GPI - anchored nanobody constructs and with Clathrin Heavy 1 Chain siRNA as described in the previous section . After 48 hours , cells were detached with trypsin and 2 resuspended in lysis buffer ( 0 . 1 % Triton - X in PBS ) and incubated at 4 °C for 20 min . Cell suspensions 3 were spun down at 20 . 000 g for 40 min at 4 °C . The supernatant was collected , denatured and run on a 4 SDS - PAGE 4 – 12 % Bis - Tris gel ( Eurogentec , ID - PA4121 - 010 ) in MOPS buffer . Blotting was performed 5 by Trans - Blot Turbo ( Bio - Rad ) with 0 . 2 µm PVDF membranes ( Bio - Rad , IB301002 ) accordingly to the 6 manufacturer’s protocol . Afterwards , the membrane was blocked in TBS supplemented with 5 % BSA for 7 1 h at RT . Next , the membrane was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 1 : 1000 dilution of anti - CHC antibody 8 ( Cell Signaling Technology , P1663 ) in TBS - T . The next day , the membrane was washed three times in 9 TBS - T and further incubated for 1 h at RT with 1 : 1000 dilution of secondary goat anti - rabbit HRP antibody 10 ( Invitrogen , 31462 ) in TBS - T . Lastly , the membrane was washed three times with TBS - T and imaged in 11 ECL solution . Next , the membrane was stripped of antibodies in a mild stripping solution for 1 h at RT 12 ( 200 mM Glycine , 1 % SDS , 10 % Tween - 20 in dH 2 O , pH 2 . 2 ) before the staining and imaging procedures 13 were performed again with loading control anti - GAPDH antibodies ( Abcam , ab8245 ) . 14 Correlative light and electron microscopy . 15 Transfected cells expressing the Nanobody - GPI construct were grown on carbon - coated sapphire discs ( 3 16 mm diameter , 50 µm thickness , Wohlwend GmbH , art . 405 ) . Next day , cells were treated with 5 µg / ml 17 GEM - GFP at 4 ˚C for 20 min and then transferred to 37 ˚C for the indicated times . After treatment , the 18 samples were high pressure frozen ( HPM010 , AbraFluid ) in their growth medium and freeze substituted 19 ( EM - AFS2 , Leica Microsystems ) with 0 . 1 % uranyl acetate in dry acetone at - 90 ˚C for 40 h . The 20 temperature was then raised to - 45 ˚C with a rate of 4 . 5 ˚C / h and the sample were further incubated for 5 h . 21 After rinsing in acetone , the samples were infiltrated with increasing concentrations of Lowicryl HM20 22 resin ( 25 % , 50 % , 75 % , 4 h / step and 3 x 10 h in 100 % ) , while raising the temperature to - 25 ˚C . Finally , 23 the samples were UV - polymerized at - 25 ˚C . The sapphire disc was then removed from the resin and 300 24 nm sections parallel to the block surface were cut and collected on carbon coated mesh grids ( S160 , Plano ) . 25 Fluorescence imaging of the sections on the grids was carried out with a widefield fluorescence microscope 26 ( Olympus IX81 ) equipped with a 100x 1 . 40 NA Plan - Apochromat oil immersion objective . After post - 27 staining with 2 % uranyl acetate in 70 % methanol and Reynold’s lead citrate , tilt series of the areas of 28 interest were acquired with TECNAI F30 transmission electron microscope ( FEI ) at 300 kV acceleration 29 voltage using the software package SerialEM 69 . Tomograms were reconstructed using IMOD 70 . Correlation 30 between fluorescence and electron microscopy images was performed with the plugin ec - CLEM 71 of the 31 software platform Icy 72 , using features of the sample that could be identified in both imaging modalities . 32 Platinum Replica Electron Microscopy ( PREM ) 33 NRK49F cells were transfected with the 0 . 036 nM binding affinity GPI - anchored nanobody plasmid using 1 Lipfectamine 3000 ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . 24 h after 2 transfection , the cells were detached with 1 mM EDTA in PBS , pelleted at 200g for 4 min , and resuspended 3 in cellular medium containing 0 . 3 µg / ml GEMs . Cell suspension was incubated with GEMs for 5 min at 4 37°C and inverted every 1 min . 25 mm round coverslips ( thickness no . 1 . 5 ) were coated with 0 . 01 % ( wt / vol ) 5 poly - L - Lysine solution ( Sigma ) for 20 min and cell - GEM suspension was then plated on the coverslips . 6 Cells were attached to the coverslips by centrifugation at 100 g for 1 min . After attachment cells were 7 incubated at 37°C for 10 min prior to unroofing and fixation . 8 Cells were unroofed to obtain plasma membrane sheets as described previously 29 , 30 . Briefly , cells on 9 coverslips were placed in stabilization buffer ( 70 mM KCl , 30 mM HEPES , 5 mM MgCl2 , 3 mM EGTA , 10 at pH 7 . 4 with KOH ) and unroofing was performed with a squirt of 2 % PFA in stabilization buffer ( EM 11 grade , freshly prepared , Electron Microscopy Science # 15710 ) on the cells using a 21 - gauge needle and 12 syringe . Afterwards , the unroofed cells were placed in fresh 4 % PFA for 15 min at 21°C and then used for 13 immunostaining . 14 Immunostaining of PREM samples 15 After fixation the coverslips were washed in stabilization buffer once and fixation was quenched with 50 16 mM NH4Cl in stabilization buffer for 7 min and washed two more times . Cells were blocked for 1 h with 17 4 % ( v / v ) horse serum and 1 % ( w / v ) bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) in stabilization buffer . The samples were 18 then incubated with anti - clathrin heavy chain ( P1663 ) antibody ( 1 : 100 , # 2410 , Cell Signaling Technology ) 19 and 1 % BSA in stabilization buffer at 21°C for 1 h followed by 4 washing steps with 1 % BSA in 20 stabilization buffer . Next , cells were incubated with goat anti - rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 568 ( 1 : 500 , # A - 11011 , 21 Invitrogen ) and CellMask Deep Red Plasma Membrane Stain ( 1 : 5000 , # C10046 , Invitrogen ) with 1 % BSA 22 in stabilization buffer for 45 min . Samples were rinsed 4 times with stabilization buffer , postfixed in 4 % 23 ( w / v ) paraformaldehyde in stabilization buffer for 10 min and quenched as described above prior to imaging 24 by spinning disc confocal microscopy . 25 Platinum replica preparation 26 After spinning disc confocal microscopy , the plasma membrane sheets were fixed in 2 % glutaraldehyde in 27 stabilization buffer for at least 30 min and EM samples were prepared as described previously 29 , 30 . Samples 28 were rinsed 3 times with water and stained with 0 . 1 % ( w / v ) tannic acid for 20 min followed by staining 29 with 0 . 1 % ( w / v ) uranyl acetate for 20 min . The coverslips were then dehydrated through a series of 30 increasing ethanol concentration to 100 % ethanol followed by critical point drying ( Leica EM CPD300 ) . 31 The coverslips were then low angle rotary shadowed with 1 . 4 nm platinum and 5 nm carbon in a dual ion 1 beam evaporator ( Leica EM ACE600 ) . 2 Electron microscopy 3 Platinum and carbon coated coverslips were mounted with double sided carbon disks and imaged at a Helios 4 5CX scanning electron microscope . Low resolution scans for navigation were done with ETD or ICE 5 detectors using MAPS software . Alignment of fluorescence microscopic overview images with SEM tile 6 sets to navigate to cells of interest was done with MAPS as well . Ultrahigh resolution scanning of unroofed 7 cells was done with TLD detector in secondary electron mode at 3 . 7 mm working distance , 5 kV , 21 pA , 1 8 µs dwell time , line integration mode ( 8 cycles ) and 0 . 67 nm pixel size . Tile sets were stitched with the 9 Grid / Collection stitching plugin in ImageJ . Images were 2x2 binned . 10 Correlative Light Electron Microscopy for the PREM samples 11 Correlation of fluorescence microscopic and SEM images was achieved by taking overview images of the 12 CellMask signal using 10x magnification for navigation and by marking the region on the coverslip used 13 for fluorescence microscopic imaging with a diamond pen . After SEM imaging the fluorescence 14 microscopic images were aligned to the ultrahigh resolution SEM images . Coarse alignment was done based 15 on the CellMask staining and the cell borders , exact alignment was done based on the clathrin staining using 16 the BigWarp plugin in ImageJ . 17 Spinning disc confocal microscopy 18 Fluorescence images were acquired on an inverted IX71 microscope ( Olympus ) equipped with a CSU - X1 19 spinning disk unit ( Yokogawa ) and an iLas laser illumination system ( Gataca Systems ) with 491 nm , 561 20 nm and 639 nm lasers for illumination . 10x NA 0 . 3 air or 60x NA 1 . 42 oil objectives ( Olympus ) were used , 21 and images were captured with an ORCA Flash 4 . 0LT sCMOS camera ( Hamamatsu ) . The system was 22 operated using the software MetaMorph . 23 Image analysis and quantification of colocalization . 24 Image analysis and fluorescence intensity quantification were performed with ImageJ 73 . The percentage of 25 colocalization between the two channels ( Organelle and Virus / GEM ) imaged was quantitatively determined 26 on a per‐object basis using a custom - made pipeline in CellProfiler 74 . In brief , the Z - stacks acquired for each 27 channel were first split into individual images that were then segmented into objects identifying either the 28 VLPs / GEMs or the specific organelles inside cells . The percentage of colocalization was then calculated as 29 the amount of overlapping pixels between the identified objects in the two channels divided by the total 30 pixel area occupied by the Virus / GEM channel . 31 Calculation of energy gain for joint particle wrapping in tubules . 1 We numerically determined the energy gain for the joint wrapping of GEM - GFP particles in tubules by 2 minimizing the sum of bending and adhesion energies for the rotationally symmetric shapes of the 3 membrane tubules and for membrane segments wrapping single particles as previously described 32 . For the 4 energy minimization , the profiles of the rationally symmetric membranes around the particles are 5 discretized into up to about 400 segments in the parametrizations as previously described 32 . To avoid 6 membrane overlap in nearly closed membrane necks obtained for large values of the adhesion potential 7 depth U ( small values of K D ) , the distance of membrane midplanes in these necks is constrained to be larger 8 than 5 nm . The minimum - energy shapes were determined via constrained minimization with the 9 FindMinimum function of the program Mathematica 13 [ Wolfram Research , Inc . , Mathematica , Version 10 13 . 2 , Champaign , IL ( 2022 ) ] . 11 References 1 1 .
