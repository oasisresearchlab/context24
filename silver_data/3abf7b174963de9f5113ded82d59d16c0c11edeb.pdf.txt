However , the potential role of TACC3 in breast cancer remains largely unknown . In the present study , we found that TACC3 was highly - expressed in breast cancer tissues , and its level was positively correlated with the clinical features of breast cancer patients . Speciﬁcally , TACC3 expression was signiﬁcantly associated with the estrogen receptor ( ER ) , progesterone receptor ( PR ) , human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) status , nodal status , the scarff - bloom - richardson ( SBR ) grade , nottingham prognostic index ( NPI ) , age , subtypes , and triple - negative and basal - like status , suggesting that TACC3 may be a potential diagnostic indicator of breast cancer . Furthermore , functional studies have shown that inhibition of TACC3 can signiﬁcantly promote the cell proliferation and viability of breast cancer cells . Moreover , TACC3 knockdown suppressed the expression of E - cadherin , but increased the expression of N - cadherin , Snail , ZEB1 , and TWIST , which indicate that TACC3 may impact the migration of breast cancer cells in vitro . Taken together , these ﬁndings indicate that TACC3 may serve as a prognostic and therapeutic indicator of breast cancer . Keywords : TACC3 , breast cancer , expression , cell proliferation , cell invasion INTRODUCTION Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in women around the world , and it is also one of the cancers with the highest mortality rates among women in the world ( Bray et al . , 2018 ) . Metastasis is the primary cause of death in breast cancer patients ( Huo et al . , 2020 ) . Although the current treatments have improved the survival rate and quality of life , the prognosis for patients with advanced cancer is still poor . Therefore , it is important to study the potential mechanism of cancer occurrence and development ( Zeng et al . , 2018 ) . The transforming acidic coiled - coil 3 ( TACC3 ) belongs to the TACC family of centrosome proteins and has a highly conserved C - terminal curly coil domain ( Lin et al . , 2018 ) . TACC3 is a tumor - related gene related to cancer development ( Song et al . , 2016 ) . This gene product can regulate the formation of microtubules throughout the cell cycle ( Kinoshita et al . , 2005 ; Lioutas and Vernos , 2013 ) . Studies have shown that TACC3 is highly expressed in lung cancer Frontiers in Genetics | www . frontiersin . org 1 June 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 640078 fgene - 12 - 640078 May 29 , 2021 Time : 9 : 57 # 2 Huo et al . TACC3 and Breast Cancer ( Ha et al . , 2015 ) , bladder cancer ( Wang et al . , 2011 ) , multiple myeloma ( Stewart et al . , 2004 ) , osteosarcoma ( Matsuda et al . , 2018 ) , prostate cancer ( Li et al . , 2017 ) , glioblastoma ( Singh et al . , 2012 ) , ovarian cancer ( Lauﬀart et al . , 2005 ) , and colorectal cancer ( Du et al . , 2016 ) . Additionally , previous studies demonstrated that TACC3 deﬁciency inhibited the epithelial - mesenchymal transition phenotype by activating the PI3K / Akt and ERK signaling pathways ( Ha et al . , 2013 ) . Based on these studies , it seems that TACC3 may promote tumor progression by increasing cell proliferation , cancer stem cell population , and cancer cell migration ( Ma et al . , 2018 ) . However , the potential role of TACC3 in breast cancer is still largely unknown . In this report , we comprehensively analyzed the expression of TACC3 and correlated it with clinicopathological parameters of breast cancer patients by using extensive bioinformatics data mining process , and then analyzed the protein network of TACC3 - predicted associations with and alterations in cancer genomics . Moreover , we investigated the mutation rate , single - nucleotide variation ( SNV ) , copy number variation ( CNV ) distribution , and functional enrichment analyses of TACC3 in breast cancer . The results were validated by the experiments below . Knockdown of TACC3 increased cell migration of breast cancer in vitro . Taken together , these data indicate that TACC3 plays a role in the migration of and invasion by breast cancer cells in vitro . RESULTS Retrieval of Signiﬁcantly Dysregulated Genes in Breast Cancer To identify the genes related to the development and progression of breast cancer , we selected four independent microarrays stored in the Oncomine database . Based on the Oncomine online tool , all the genes from the data of four groups were compared . We discovered that 40 genes were signiﬁcantly up - regulated ( p < 9 . 00E - 3 ) and 40 genes were signiﬁcantly down - regulated ( p < 1 . 50E - 2 ) in breast cancer were retrieved ( Figure 1 ) . Over a total of 80 genes , 6 genes ( CTHRC1 , COL11A1 , FN1 , COL10A1 , SULF1 , and TACC3 ) were up - expressed ( Figure 1A ) , and 9 genes ( CIRBP , EGFR , THRA , NCOA1 , RPL13 , RBPMS , DST , TNXB , and CNN1 ) were down - expressed ( Figure 1B ) . High Expression of TACC3 in Breast Cancer We examined the expression of TACC3 between breast tumors and adjacent normal tissues using the DriverDBv3 database . The results were shown in Figure 2A , and compared with normal tissues , the TACC3 transcription level was signiﬁcantly higher in breast cancer . Additionally , to conﬁrm the diﬀerences in TACC3 expression in breast cancer , the expression of TACC3 was analyzed by using RNA - seq data from multiple malignancies in TCGA . From the GEPIA database , we found that TACC3 mRNA in breast cancer tissues ( 1 , 085 cases ) was signiﬁcantly higher than that in normal tissues ( 112 cases ) ( p < 0 . 05 ) ( Figure 2B ) . Furthermore , the representative immunohistochemical staining patterns for TACC3 were analyzed . We found that TACC3 was strongly expressed in breast cancer patient tissues ( Figure 2C ) , but negative in adjacent tissues . Together , these results demonstrated that TACC3 was highly expressed in breast cancer patients . Relationship Between the TACC3 Expression and Clinical Characteristics of Breast Cancer Patients To better understand the correlation and potential mechanisms of TACC3 expression in breast cancer , we investigated the relationship between the TACC3 expression and clinical characteristics of breast cancer patients using bc - GenExMiner 4 . 4 . The expression of TACC3 mRNA was signiﬁcantly diﬀerent in ER status ( ER - > ER + , p < 0 . 0001 , Figure 3A ) , PR status ( PR - > PR + , p < 0 . 0001 , Figure 3B ) , and HER2 status ( HER2 + > HER2 - , p = 0 . 0006 , Figure 3C ) . In addition , TACC3 expression was signiﬁcantly increased in patients with a negative nodal status ( N + ) than those with positive nodal status ( N − ) ( p < 0 . 001 ) ( Figure 3D ) . The analysis of SBR grade showed that the increased SBR level was signiﬁcantly associated with the increased TACC3 transcript level ( SBR1 < SBR2 < SBR3 , p < 0 . 001 ) ( Figure 3E ) . The NPI grade showed a consistent trend ( NPI1 < NPI2 < NPI3 , p < 0 . 001 ) ( Figure 3F ) . For patient age , TACC3 mRNA expression was signiﬁcantly higher in the 21 – 40 year group than in the 41 – 70 years group and 70 – 97 years groups ( p < 0 . 001 , Figure 3G ) . In addition , we found that there were signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the expression of TACC3 mRNA in the subtypes ( basal - like > luminal B > HER2E > luminal A > normal breast - like , p < 0 . 001 , Figure 3H ) and basal - like and TNBC status ( basal - like and TNBC > Non - basal like and non - TNBC , Figure 3I ) . These results suggest that TACC3 expression may serve as a potential diagnostic indicator in breast cancer . Analysis of the Mutation Rate , CNVs Distribution , and Functional Enrichment Analyses of TACC3 in Breast Cancer We used the DriverDBv3 tool to determine the mutation rate and CNVs distribution of TACC3 in breast cancer . Figure 4A shows the mutation rate of TACC3 and its protein positions in breast cancer . We found that the TACC3 protein had the highest mutation rate at positions 670 – 671 . On the contrary , the mutation rate of the TACC3 protein was the lowest at 0 – 42 and 545 – 587 . Additionally , the CNVs squares indicate the CNVs gain or loss for TACC3 in breast cancer ( Figure 4B ) . We found that the distribution of CNVs primarily included gain , loss , none , and normal , and was positively correlated with the expression of TACC3 in breast cancer ( cor = 0 . 112 , p = 0 . 0021 ) . To validate the biological interaction network of TACC3 in breast cancer , we identiﬁed genes co - expressed with TACC3 using the STRING database ( Figure 4C ) . The following ten proteins were found to interact with TACC3 : cytoskeleton - associated protein 5 ( CKAP5 ) , aurora kinase A ( AURKA ) , cell division cycle protein 20 homolog ( CDC20 ) , cyclin - dependent kinase 1 ( CDK1 ) , serine / threonine - protein kinase PLK1 ( PLK1 ) , Frontiers in Genetics | www . frontiersin . org 2 June 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 640078 fgene - 12 - 640078 May 29 , 2021 Time : 9 : 57 # 3 Huo et al . TACC3 and Breast Cancer FIGURE 1 | The 80 genes that were signiﬁcantly dysregulated in breast cancer according to four independent microarrays retrieved from the Oncomine database . ( A ) The top 40 genes upregulated in microarrays . ( B ) The top 40 genes downregulated in microarrays . aurora kinase B ( AURKB ) , kinesin - like protein KIF11 ( KIF11 ) , nuclear distribution protein nudE - like 1 ( NDEL1 ) , nucleolar and spindle associated protein 1 ( NUSAP1 ) , and abnormal spindle - like microcephaly - associated protein ( ASPM ) , and their correlation scores were 0 . 999 , 0 . 999 , 0 . 974 , 0 . 971 , 0 . 970 , 0 . 968 , 0 . 964 , 0 . 962 , 0 . 956 , and 0 . 955 , respectively . As shown in the Figure 4D , the top three proteins ( CKAP5 , AURKA , and CDC20 ) interacting with TACC3 were veriﬁed by immunoprecipitation in breast cancer cells , and CKAP5 , AURKA , and CDC20 were detected in the immunoprecipitation of anti TACC3 antibody . This result indicates that TACC3 physically interacts with these proteins , and the potential biological function of TACC3 . To further understand the SNVs and CNVs of these proteins , we performed an analysis with GSCALite ( Figures 4E , F ) . We found that the SNVs frequencies of ASPM , CKAP5 , KIF11 , AURKA , CDC20 , and TACC3 were in the top six , at 44 , 16 , 13 , 9 , 9 , and 7 % , respectively . Among them , the variant types of TACC3 were primarily missense mutations . The metascape enrichment analysis results on the TACC3 interacting genes are shown in Frontiers in Genetics | www . frontiersin . org 3 June 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 640078 fgene - 12 - 640078 May 29 , 2021 Time : 9 : 57 # 4 Huo et al . TACC3 and Breast Cancer FIGURE 2 | The TACC3 expression levels in different types of cancer and normal tissues .

Blue and purple dashed lines represent the average value of all the tumor and normal tissues , respectively . ( B ) Gene Expression Proﬁling Interaction Analysis ( GEPIA ) for the expression of TACC3 in breast tumor tissues and normal tissues . The TCGA data revealed that TACC3 mRNA was signiﬁcantly higher in breast cancer tissues ( 1 , 085 cases ) than that in normal tissues ( 291 cases ) . ( C ) Immunohistochemical staining revealed that TACC3 exhibited high expression in breast tumor tissues . The TACC3 proteins were detected with a TACC3 - speciﬁc antibody ( brown ) , Nuclei were stained with hematoxylin ( blue ) . Fresh breast cancer tissue specimens were obtained from 30 patients who underwent surgery . Scale bar , 50 µ m . Figure 4G . The results showed that the biological processes of these genes were enriched in the microtubule cytoskeleton organization involved in mitosis , microtubule cytoskeleton organization , and cell division . Therefore , we hypothesized that TACC3 might serve as a biomarker for breast cancer research . TACC3 Knockdown Promotes Tumor Formation TACC3 is highly expressed in breast cancer , but whether the downregulation of TACC3 represses tumorigenesis remains unknown . Therefore , the eﬀect on colony proliferation and cell formation can be observed in the TACC3 - knockdown T47D and SK - BR - 3 cells by using siRNA ( Figures 5A , B ) . Furthermore , we explored the eﬀects of TACC3 expression on cell proliferation and cell colony - forming ability , the eﬀect of TACC3 on cell proliferation can be demonstrated by the CCK8 and colony formation assays ( Figure 5C ) . The CCK8 cell proliferation assays results showed that TACC3 knockdown in T47D and SK - BR - 3 cells increased cell capacity compared with the NC groups ( Figure 5D ) . Notably , similar results can be observed from the colony formation assays , the cell colony - forming number increased in the TACC3 - knockdown T47D and SK - BR - 3 cells . Meanwhile , we treated cells with cytotoxic drug cisplatin ( DDP ) and found that the survival rate of cells with knockdown TACC3 was signiﬁcantly higher compared with negative control cells by CCK8 assay ( Figure 5E ) . We hypothesized that the cells with knockdown of TACC3 had enhanced resistance to apoptosis from cell injury . TACC3 Inhibited Breast Cancer Cell Migration in vitro Previous studies have shown that EMT is related to the occurrence , invasion , and metastasis of tumors ( Pastushenko and Blanpain , 2019 ) . Because TACC3 knockdown can promote cell invasion of breast cancer , we speculate that TACC3 can aﬀect the cell EMT process in breast cancer . To determine the role of TACC3 in breast cancer metastasis , we ﬁrst transfected the T47D and SK - BR - 3 cell lines with the control vector and TACC3 Frontiers in Genetics | www . frontiersin . org 4 June 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 640078 fgene - 12 - 640078 May 29 , 2021 Time : 9 : 57 # 5 Huo et al .

Not TNBC ) . under - expression vector . Cell migration to the wound area was analyzed at 0 h and 48 h after injury . The results showed that knocking down TACC3 signiﬁcantly promoted wound healing compared with the negative control ( Figure 6A ) . The transwell invasion assays results showed that knockdown of TACC3 in T47D and SK - BR - 3 cell lines increased cell invasion number compared with the si - NC groups ( Figure 6B ) . Taken together , these data indicate that TACC3 plays a role in the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro . TACC3 Might Be Involved in Notch4 and CDH5 - Related Signaling Pathways Notch4 and CDH5 are two important genes involved in EMT and the aggressive phenotype of breast cancer ( D’Angelo et al . , 2015 ; Fry et al . , 2016 ) . To verify the correlation between TACC3 and Notch4 and CDH5 , we examined the RNA - seq data ( N = 4 , 712 ) of breast cancer cohort in the TCGA database by using bc - GenExMinerv 4 . 4 ( Figure 7A ) . The results showed that TACC3 expression was negatively correlated with Notch4 ( r = − 0 . 23 , p < 0 . 0001 ) and CDH5 ( r = − 0 . 33 , p < 0 . 0001 ) . Then , we further investigated the results using the TIMER database ( Figure 7B ) . We found that TACC3 expression was negatively correlated with Notch4 ( r = − 0 . 202 , p = 1 . 43e - 11 ) and CDH5 ( r = − 0 . 295 , p = 9 . 9e - 24 ) . Moreover , we used western blotting to study the changes of protein markers in TACC3 - knockdown breast cancer cells . The result was consistent with our hypothesis that knockdown of TACC3 in T47D and SK - BR - 3 cells resulted in increased expression of Notch4 and CDH5 ( Figure 7C ) . These ﬁndings suggest that TACC3 may be closely related to the Notch4 and CDH5 signaling pathways in breast cancer .

TACC3 Represses the Epithelial - Mesenchymal Transition Through the Wnt / β - Catenin and Notch Signaling Pathways Our previous studies have shown that the Notch4 and CDH5 activity are activated by siTACC3 , and hypothesized that the loss of TACC3 may also promote EMT through the Wnt / β - catenin and Notch signaling pathways . To examine this hypothesis , the expression of E - cadherin , N - cadherin , Snail , ZEB1 , and TWIST were analyzed after siTACC3 treatment . The RT - PCR analysis revealed that knocking of TACC3 in the T47D and SK - BR - 3 cells decreased the expression of epithelial marker E - cadherin , but increased the expression of mesenchymal markers N - cadherin , Snail , ZEB1 , and TWIST ( Figure 8A ) . We then used western blots to study the changes of EMT protein markers after Frontiers in Genetics | www . frontiersin . org 6 June 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 640078 fgene - 12 - 640078 May 29 , 2021 Time : 9 : 57 # 7 Huo et al .

This result is consistent with our hypothesis that the stromal markers that promote metastasis ( such as N - cadherin , Snail , ZEB1 , and TWIST ) are up - regulated , while the epithelial markers that inhibit metastasis ( E - cadherin ) are down - regulated . These results suggest that TACC3 plays an important role in breast cancer metastasis . DISCUSSION TACC3 is a member of the TACC family located on human chromosome 4p16 ( Song et al . , 2016 ) . TACC3 is one of the important regulators of microtubule stability in the process of mammalian mitotic spindle assembly ( Lin et al . , 2018 ) . TACC3 also plays an important role in transcription and tumorigenesis Frontiers in Genetics | www . frontiersin . org 7 June 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 640078 fgene - 12 - 640078 May 29 , 2021 Time : 9 : 57 # 8 Huo et al .

Zhi - Rui Lin et al . found that the up - regulation of TACC3 was positively correlated with the tumor aggressiveness , grade , T stage , and progression in bladder cancer patients ( Lin et al . , 2018 ) . The expression of TACC3 may predict the radiosensitivity and prognosis of locally advanced rectal cancer ( Ma et al . , 2018 ) . In addition , TACC3 can be used as a biomarker with a potential role in breast cancer detection and for the prediction of clinical outcomes ( Campo and Breuer , 2018 ) . Despite these observations , the potential role of TACC3 and its molecular mechanisms in breast cancer remains to be addressed . In the present study , we found that the expression level of TACC3 was signiﬁcantly higher in breast cancer tissues than that in normal tissues , which is consistent with Song et al . ( 2016 ) . Frontiers in Genetics | www . frontiersin . org 8 June 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 640078 fgene - 12 - 640078 May 29 , 2021 Time : 9 : 57 # 9 Huo et al . TACC3 and Breast Cancer FIGURE 7 | The expression correlation between TACC3 and Notch4 and CDH5 . ( A ) The correlation between TACC3 and Notch4 and CDH5 according to bc - GenExMiner v 4 . 4 . ( B ) The correlation between TACC3 and Notch4 and CDH5 according to the TIMER database . ( C ) The Notch4 and CDH5 protein levels were evaluated by Western blot analysis in the siTACC3 - treated cells . All assays were performed in biological triplicate . Furthermore , to better understand the relevance and potential mechanisms of TACC3 expression in breast cancer , we investigated the relationship between the TACC3 expression and clinical characteristics of breast cancer patients and found that TACC3 expression was signiﬁcantly associated with the ER , PR , HER2 status , nodal status , SBR , NPI , age , subtypes , and triple - negative and basal - like status . These results suggest that TACC3 expression may be a potential diagnostic indicator for breast cancer . In addition , the protein - protein interaction data demonstrated that CKAP5 , AURKA , and CDC20 showed the highest correlation with TACC3 . AURKA has been conﬁrmed as an oncogene in cancer development ( Nikonova et al . , 2013 ) . Furukawa T et al . revealed that AURKA was one of the downstream targets of MAPK1 / ERK2 in pancreatic cancer ( Furukawa et al . , 2006 ) . CDC20 is associated with malignant progression and poor prognosis among various cancers ( Cheng et al . , 2019 ) . It may be a promising therapeutic target against human cancer ( Wang et al . , 2015 ) . Therefore , the close interaction of TACC3 with CKAP5 , AURKA , and CDC20 may suggest the role of TACC3 in the progression of breast cancer , although future mechanistic studies are needed to verify this possibility . We performed SNV and CNV analyses of these proteins using GSCALite , and the variant type of TACC3 was primarily missense mutation . In addition , the enrichment analysis of TACC3 interaction showed that the biological processes of these genes were enriched in microtubule cytoskeleton organization involved in mitosis , microtubule cytoskeleton organization , and cell division . These results reveal the potential regulatory role of TACC3 in breast cancer . A great deal of eﬀort has been expended on studying the biological mechanisms of TACC3 over - expression in cancers ( Stewart et al . , 2004 ; Lauﬀart et al . , 2005 ; Wang et al . , 2011 ; Singh et al . , 2012 ; Ha et al . , 2015 ; Du et al . , 2016 ; Li et al . , 2017 ; Matsuda et al . , 2018 ) . However , little is known about the precise mechanism of TACC3 downregulated . Therefore , The eﬀects on colony formation and cell proliferation can be observed on TACC3 - knocked down in T47D and SK - BR - 3 cells . To determine the role of TACC3 in breast cancer metastasis , we transfected T47D and SK - BR - 3 cell lines with the control vector and TACC3 under - expression vector . Inhibition of TACC3 expression by siRNA could signiﬁcantly promote cell proliferation and viability . Taken together , these data indicate that TACC3 plays a role in the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro . Notch4 and CDH5 are two important genes involved in EMT and the aggressive phenotype of breast cancer ( D’Angelo et al . , 2015 ; Fry et al . , 2016 ) . We also investigated the possible relationship between TACC3 , Notch4 , and CDH5 in the proliferation of breast cancer cells . Many studies have proved that the high expression of Notch4 and CDH5 is an important factor to promote tumor development ( Soriano et al . , 2000 ; Berx and van Roy , 2009 ; Frontiers in Genetics | www . frontiersin . org 9 June 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 640078 fgene - 12 - 640078 May 29 , 2021 Time : 9 : 57 # 10 Huo et al .

Mao et al . , 2013 ; Giuli et al . , 2019 ) . We have veriﬁed the signiﬁcant negative correlation between TACC3 and these two proteins through public databases and experiments . Knockdown of TACC3 upregulates the expression of Notch4 and CDH5 , suggesting that TACC3 may be closely related to Notch4 and CDH5 signaling pathways in breast cancer . According to reports , TACC3 reported being a negative regulator of Notch signaling by binding to the CDC10 / anchorin repeat sequence ( Bargo et al . , 2010 ) . Previous studies have found that TACC3 deﬁciency can inhibit the epithelial - mesenchymal transition phenotype by activating the PI3K / Akt and ERK signaling pathways , resulting in a high apoptosis rate of p53 - mediated ( Piekorz et al . , 2002 ; Ha et al . , 2013 ) . Therefore , we hypothesized that the loss of TACC3 may also promote EMT through the Wnt / β - catenin and Notch signaling pathways . To examine this hypothesis , the expression of E - cadherin , N - cadherin , Snail , ZEB1 , and TWIST were analyzed after siTACC3 treatment . The downregulation of TACC3 inhibited the expression of E - cadherin and increased the expression of N - cadherin , Snail , ZEB1 , and TWIST . These results suggest that TACC3 plays an important role in the metastasis of breast cancer . MATERIALS AND METHODS Data Source The Oncomine database 1 is the largest oncogene chip database platform in the world .

According to four microarray studies ( 1 . invasive ductal breast carcinoma stroma vs . normal Karnoub breast , Nature , 2007 ; 2 . ductal breast carcinoma vs . normal Richardson breast 2 , Cancer Cell , 2006 ; 3 . invasive ductal breast carcinoma vs . normal Turashvili breast , BMC Cancer , 2007 ; and 4 . invasive lobular breast carcinoma vs . normal Turashvili breast , BMC Cancer , 2007 ) , the genes with obvious disorders in breast cancer tissues were identiﬁed . TACC3 Expression Analysis The expression of TACC3 in diﬀerent cancer types was investigated using the DriverDB database 2 , which is a database of cancer histology , including the annotation basis , somatic mutation , RNA expression , miRNA expression , methylation , copy number variation , and clinical data ( Liu et al . , 2020 ) . 2 http : / / driverdb . tms . cmu . edu . tw / Frontiers in Genetics | www . frontiersin . org 10 June 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 640078 fgene - 12 - 640078 May 29 , 2021 Time : 9 : 57 # 11 Huo et al . TACC3 and Breast Cancer We then used the GEPIA database 3 to analyze the expression level of TACC3 in breast cancer tissues and normal tissues ( Tang et al . , 2017 ) . Association of Clinicopathological Parameters With TACC3 in Breast Cancer Patients bc - GenExMinerv 4 . 4 is a database containing the published annotated genomic data , including data from DNA microarrays ( n = 10 , 012 ) and RNA - seq ( n = 4 , 713 ) ( Jézéquel et al . , 2012 ) . We analyzed the TACC3 expression levels based on various classiﬁcation parameters , such as the estrogen receptor ( ER ) and progesterone receptor ( PR ) expression , HER2 status ( ER + / ER - , PR + / PR - , and HER2 + / HER2 - ) , nodal status ( N + / N - ) , scarﬀ - bloom - richardson grade ( SBR : SBR1 , SBR2 , and SBR3 ) , nottingham prognostic index ( NPI : NPI1 , NPI2 , and NPI3 ) , age ( 21 – 40 , 40 – 70 , and 70 – 97 ) , subtypes ( basal - like , luminal B , HER2E , luminal A , and normal breast - like ) , and triple - negative and basal - like status ( triple - negative and TNBC and not basal - like status and not TNBC ) . A value of p < 0 . 05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant . Bioinformatic Analyses We used the DriverDBv3 tool to determine the mutation rate and CNVs distribution of TACC3 in breast cancer ( Berx and van Roy , 2009 ) . Next , we analyzed the functional protein association network using the STRING database 4 ( Crosara et al . , 2018 ) . In addition , we performed the SNVs and CNVs of these proteins analyses with Gene set cancer analysis ( GSCALite : 5 ) ( Akbani et al . , 2014 ) . We analyzed the gene set for SNVs using the statistics , distribution , and types ; for the CNVs , we analyzed the statistics of deletion / ampliﬁcation for hetero / homozygous CNVs . The pathway and process enrichment analysis were performed with metascape ( Zhou et al . , 2019 ) . Cell Culture , Reverse Transfection , and Quantitative PCR Analyses Breast cancer cell lines including T47D and SK - BR - 3 cells were obtained from the Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences ( Shanghai , China ) . All of the cells were cultured in RPMI Medium 1640 supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) ( GIBCO , United States ) . SK - BR - 3 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10 % FBS . siRNAs were purchased from GenePharma ( Suzhou , China ) . Sequences of si # 1 were 5 (cid:48) - GCAGGUCUUAAACGACAAATT , sequences of si # 2 were 5 (cid:48) - ACTAGATTGCTTTGAAAAC . The cells were transfected with TACC3 siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen , United States ) . The cells were harvested 72 h after transfection . The total cellular RNA was extracted using a PureLink RNA Mini Kit ( Invitrogen , United States ) , and the RNA quality was examined by Nanodrop ( Thermo , United States ) analysis . The total mRNA was reverse - transcribed into cDNA 3 http : / / gepia . cancer - pku . cn / index . html 4 https : / / string - db . org / 5 http : / / bioinfo . life . hust . edu . cn / web / GSCALite / using the 5 × Primescript RT Master Mix ( Takara ) . Quantitative RT - PCR was performed using 2 × TB Green Premix Ex Taq ( Takara ) in a Bio - Rad detection system . The data for each gene was normalized against the β - actin levels . Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitation The T47D and SK - BR - 3 cells were homogenized in RIPA lysis buﬀer ( Meilunbio , Shanghai , China ) containing protease inhibitor mixture on ice for 30 min , then centrifuged for 10 min at 12 , 000 rpm in a 4 ◦ C Eppendorf microfuge ( Thermo , United States ) . Loading buﬀer was added to the protein lysate and boiled for 5 min . The samples were then separated on SDS polyacrylamide gels , which were transferred to PVDF membranes ( Millipore ) and probed with their respective antibodies . The following primary antibodies were used : TACC3 ( 1 : 1 , 000 ; Abcam , United States ) , CDH5 ( 1 : 1 , 000 , Abcam , United States ) , Notch4 ( 1 : 1 , 000 , Abcam , United States ) , E - cadherin ( 1 : 1 , 000 , Cell Signaling Technology , United States ) and N - cadherin ( 1 : 1 , 000 , Cell Signaling Technology , United States ) , Snail ( 1 : 1 , 000 , Cell Signaling Technology , United States ) , ZEB1 ( 1 : 1 , 000 , Abcam , United States ) , TWIST ( 1 : 1 , 000 , Abcam , United States ) , and GAPDH ( 1 : 1 , 000 , Abcam , United States ) . For immunoprecipitation , cells were homogenized in IP lysis buﬀer ( Meilunbio , Shanghai , China ) containing protease inhibitor mixture on ice for 30 min . An antibody speciﬁc for the target protein was incubated with Protein G - agarose beads ( Invitrogen , United States ) for 4 h at 4 ◦ C , and the lysate was then added to the mixture . The mixture was incubated at 4 ◦ C for 16 h . After being washed three times with ice - cold PBS , beads - bound IP product was collected , and proteins were analyzed by western blotting . Colony Formation and Cell Proliferation Assay A total of 200 cells were seeded into a 35 mm cell culture dish and cultured for 15 days in RPMI 1 , 640 medium ( Gibco ) supplemented with 10 % FBS ( Gibco ) . The colonies were imaged and counted after being ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde and stained with 1 % crystal violet solution . NC and T47D siTACC3 cells were seeded into each well of 96 well plates , with the density of 4 × 10 3 cells in 100 µ L 1 , 640 medium ( Gibco ) , and were grown overnight . The medium was then replaced with 100 µ L 1 , 640 medium with 10 % CCK8 reagent and incubated for 3 h at 37 ◦ C . At 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 days , the absorbance was measured at 450 nm . Wound Healing and Transwell Invasion Assays For the wound healing assay , NC and siTACC3 cells were cultured in six - well plates coated with 0 . 1 % gelatin . When 70 % conﬂuency is reached , the cells were starved overnight , a wound was scratched into the center of the cell monolayer with a sterile plastic pipette tip , and the debris was removed by washing with PBS washing . The wound was photographed at the indicated time .

TACC3 and Breast Cancer For the transwell invasion assays , NC cells or siTACC3 cells were prepared as a cell suspension using a serum - free medium , we seeded 1 × 10 5 cells in the upper chamber of the transwell plate . A complete medium containing 10 % FBS was added to the lower chambers . Culture in a cell culture incubator for 24 h . The migrated cells in the lower chamber were ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde , stained with crystal violet for 10 min , and then analyzed by optical microscope . Immunohistochemistry Analysis This study was performed on archived tissues from 30 diagnosed cases of breast cancer . Breast cancer tissue samples were taken from breast cancer patients who underwent surgery in Shenzhen Second People’s Hospital from January 2018 to December 2019 . All the patients signed the informed consent form . This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Shenzhen Second People’s Hospital in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki . First , the collected tissue samples were embedded , sliced , and dewaxed ; then performed antigen repair was performed as follows : prepared 200 mL of 10 × repair solution , such as 20 mL 10 × repair solution + 180 mL distilled water was prepared , each slice was placed in the repair box and close the lid was closed , the box was placed in a 100 ◦ C water bath and reacted for 20 min , then naturally cooled to room temperature ; then , it was incubated in 3 % H 2 O 2 deionized water at room temperature in the dark for 10 min and rinsed with distilled water 2 – 3 times , for 3 min each time . The water around the slices was wiped oﬀ with ﬁlter paper , draw a circle of oil was drawn , and add an appropriate amount of blocking solution was added for protein blocking and the slices were incubated at room temperature for 20 min . The tissue was then incubated with the primary antibody and incubated overnight at 4 ◦ C , and then incubated with the secondary antibody . Avidin was added , incubated at room temperature in the dark for 20 min , then washed with PBST , followed by DAB color development + hematoxylin counterstaining and dehydration . Lastly , an image was taken with a scanning microscope . Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 25 . 0 ( SPSS , Inc . , Chicago , IL , United States ) . Data were presented as the means of the results from at least three independent experiments . one - way analysis of variance F ( ANOVA ) was used to process , and Student’s t - test was employed to assess signiﬁcant diﬀerences . A threshold of p < 0 . 05 was deﬁned as signiﬁcant for all tests . CONCLUSION In conclusion , we found that TACC3 expression was upregulated in breast cancer tissues . TACC3 expression was positively associated with the clinical characteristics of breast cancer patients . Furthermore , we demonstrated that the TACC3 knockdown promoted cell proliferation , cell invasion ability , and EMT signaling pathways in breast cancer . The mechanism of TACC3 in breast cancer requires further study . Thus , these results indicate that TACC3 has important clinical and therapeutic value in breast cancer . Our results suggest that TACC3 may serve as a potential target of breast cancer treatment . DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT Publicly available datasets were analyzed in this study .
