SUMMARY Excessive expansions of glutamine ( Q ) - rich repeats in various human proteins are known to result in se - vere neurodegenerative disorders such as Hunting - ton’s disease and several ataxias . However , the physiological role of these repeats and the conse - quences of more moderate repeat variation remain unknown . Here , we demonstrate that Q - rich domains are highly enriched in eukaryotic transcription factors where they act as functional modulators . In - cremental changes in the number of repeats in the yeast transcriptional regulator Ssn6 ( Cyc8 ) result in systematic , repeat - length - dependent variation in expression of target genes that result in direct phenotypic changes . The function of Ssn6 increases with its repeat number until a certain threshold where further expansion leads to aggregation . Quantitative proteomic analysis reveals that the Ssn6 repeats affect its solubility and interactions with Tup1 and other regulators . Thus , Q - rich repeats are dynamic functional domains that modulate a regulator’s innate function , with the inherent risk of pathogenic repeat expansions . INTRODUCTION Polyglutamine ( polyQ ) repeats have been associated with several human neurodegenerative diseases , including Hunting - ton’s disease , Kennedy disease , and multiple spinocerebellar ataxias ( reviewed in Orr and Zoghbi , 2007 ) . Like other tandem repeat ( TR ) sequences , polyQ repeats show a high mutation rate , exceeding that of single - nucleotide polymorphisms by or - ders of magnitude ( Legendre et al . , 2007 ; Lynch et al . , 2008 ) . Speciﬁcally , repeats often shrink and expand at rates between 10 (cid:1) 2 and 10 (cid:1) 6 per generation . For repeats associated with neurodegenerative diseases , variation within certain limits is not pathogenic , and different individuals in the population often have different repeat lengths ( Duitama et al . , 2014 ) . However , repeat expansion beyond a certain threshold causes disease , withlongerexpansionsleading toearlierdiseaseonsetandfaster progression . Pathogenic polyQ expansions have been shown to alter several cellular processes that can lead to neuronal dysfunction . They can modify the conformation of a protein and affect its interaction with partners ( Schaffar et al . , 2004 ) , lead to depletion of tRNA and subsequent translational frameshifting ( Girstmair et al . , 2013 ) , cause non - ATG translation and produc - tion of abnormal peptides ( Pearson , 2011 ) , and even alter normal proteasome function ( Park et al . , 2013 ) . However , despite the ubiquitous presence of TRs in functional regions of genomes ( Duitama et al . , 2014 ; Legendre et al . , 2007 ; Li et al . , 2002 ) and the fact that many repeats are conserved over evolutionary time - scales ( Schaper et al . , 2014 ) , their functional signiﬁcance outside of the pathological context remains unknown . Natural variation in the length of Q - rich repeats was often dismissed as unimportant neutral drift with no tangible phenotype or physiological role . Iso - lated studies in several organisms , however , reported instances where TR variation correlated with phenotypic changes ( Fondon and Garner , 2004 ; Sawyer et al . , 1997 ) . Although Q - rich repeats are enriched in eukaryotic transcrip - tional regulators ( Gemayel et al . , 2010 ; Legendre et al . , 2007 ) , a comprehensive understanding of their role , speciﬁcally whether their variation causes any functional changes , remains unanswered . First , using comparative genomics , we show that targets of Q - rich regulators have elevated gene - expression vari - ation across multiple timescales , suggesting a role of Q - rich re - peats in gene - expression regulation . To elucidate how variable Q - rich repeats might inﬂuence transcription , we generated mul - tiple repeat variants of the yeast transcriptional regulator Ssn6 ( Cyc8 ) . We present direct experimental evidence showing that Ssn6 repeat - length variation affects the expression of target Molecular Cell 59 , 615 – 627 , August 20 , 2015 ª 2015 The Authors 615 genes , which in turn results in a broad array of phenotypic changes . Using quantitative proteome analysis , we further demonstrate that Ssn6 solubility and its interaction with partners depend on the length of the repeat region . The Hsp70 chaperone Ssa2 helps to maintain Ssn6 function by reducing its intrinsic , repeat - length - dependent propensity to misfold and aggregate . Together , these results demonstrate that , while excessive repeat expansion is pathogenic , Q - rich repeats with normal lengths are functional domains that can help maintain and tune proper tran - scriptional regulation . RESULTS Glutamine - Rich Transcription Factors Promote Target Gene - Expression Divergence We scanned the open reading frames of all protein coding genes in genomes that span the eukaryotic diversity ( yeast , fruit ﬂy , ze - braﬁsh , mouse , human ) using Tandem Repeat Finder ( Benson , 1999 ) . We ﬁnd that 14 % – 20 % of eukaryotic genes are enriched in TRs ( Table S1 ) . We deﬁned repeats as Q rich if at least 85 % of their translated sequence comprised glutamine residues ( Table S1 ) . Gene ontology analysis of these Q - rich genes versus all genes with repeats revealed a signiﬁcant enrichment for regula - tory functions such as transcriptional regulation and chromatin modiﬁcation ( Table S2 ) . This is consistent with previous studies investigating the functional enrichment of repeat - containing pro - teins in various eukaryotic genomes ( Faux et al . , 2005 ; Gemayel et al . , 2010 ; Legendre et al . , 2007 ; Young et al . , 2000 ) . TRs are often unstable , with even closely related individuals or species showing differences in the number of repeated units in a ‘‘homol - ogous’’ TR . This prompted us to ask whether repeats in tran - scription factors ( TFs ) can inﬂuence the variability of target gene expression . To address this , we ﬁrst reconstructed a comprehensive yeast transcriptional regulatory network ( TRN ) by combining a previously published TRN ( Balaji et al . , 2006 ) with the recent genome - wide in vivo binding map of yeast regu - latory proteins ( Venters et al . , 2011 ) ( Figure 1A ) . We classiﬁed the target genes as those regulated by Q - rich TFs and those by non - repeat containing TFs ( NR - TFs ) . We next analyzed gene - expres - sion variation over long , intermediate , or short timescales by examining published datasets on yeast gene - expression varia - tion across species ( Tirosh et al . , 2006 ) , among strains ( Choi and Kim , 2008 ) , across generations ( Landry et al . , 2007 ) , and be - tween genetically identical cells at an instant ( Newman et al . , 2006 ) . We ﬁnd that target genes that are regulated by Q - rich TFs show signiﬁcantly higher levels of expression divergence , expression variability , mutational variance , and expression noise than targets of NR - TFs ( Figure 1B ) . Importantly , these differ - ences in expression patterns of the targets are not explained by changes in expression patterns of the respective TFs ( Fig - ure S1A ) or by differences in average transcript levels of targets ( Figure S2A ) . Even if we only consider TFs with low expression variation across multiple time scales , the targets of Q - rich TFs still show higher expression divergence and variability and higher mutational variance than targets of NR - TFs ( Figure S1B ) . While the targets of NR - TFs are enriched in processes related to gene - expression , those of Q - rich TFs were enriched for meta - bolic processes ( Figure S2B ) . This prompted us to investigate whether Q - rich TF targets are on average more amenable to dy - namic gene - expression regulation . To test this , we compared expression plasticity , which captures the magnitude of gene - expression variation to various conditions ( Tirosh and Barkai , 2008 ) . The results show that on average , Q - rich TF target genes show a larger range of expression modulation compared with NR - TF targets ( Figure 1C ) and those with high expression plas - ticity showed higher variation across different timescales ( Fig - ure 1D ) . Moreover , irrespective of the nature of the stimuli they respond to—exogenous ( stress ) or endogenous ( developmental transitions , etc . ) —Q - rich TF targets have higher expression vari - ation across multiple timescales than targets of NR - TFs ( Figures S2C and S2D ) . Taken together , our results suggest that among genes with highly dynamic gene - expression modulation , Q - rich TF targets tend to have enhanced expression variability at mul - tiple timescales ( Figures 1C and 1D ) . Whole - Genome Transcriptomics Reveal Gradual and Quantitative Changes in Target Expression as a Result of SSN6 Repeat Variation To assess whether the variability in Q - rich repeats within tran - scriptional regulators directly inﬂuences the expression of down - stream targets , we chose the S . cerevisiae transcriptional regu - lator Ssn6 ( Cyc8 ) ( Chen et al . , 2013 ; Tzamarias and Struhl , 1994 ; Wong and Struhl , 2011 ) . Ssn6 is a TF that controls a large number of targets that show high expression variability ( Fig - ure 1E ) . The SSN6 coding sequence comprises two Q - rich repeat regions : a ﬁrst polyQ stretch ( residues 15 – 30 ) , henceforth referred to as Tandem Repeat 1 ( TR1 ) , and a second Q - rich region , comprised of an array of QA repeats directly followed by a polyQ stretch ( residues 493 – 587 ) , referred to as TR2 ( Figure 2A ) . To check for variability in the SSN6 repeats , we sequenced both repeat regions in a number of genetically and ecologically diverse S . cerevisiae strains ( Liti et al . , 2009 ) ( Figures 2B and 2C ; Table S3 ) . Both regions showed variability in repeat number between yeast strains , with TR2 having a wider range of variation and also showing variation between closely related strains ( Fig - ure 2C ) . Similarly , we ﬁnd Q - rich repeats in other transcriptional regulators ( SWI1 and SNF5 ) to be variable between natural S . cerevisiae strains ( Figure S3 ) , indicating that the variability of the Ssn6 Q - rich repeat is typical for repeats in regulatory proteins . To investigate the direct consequences of SSN6 repeat varia - tion , we created a series of variants of the SSN6 TR1 and TR2 re - gions in the reference yeast strain Sigma1278b ( Figure 2D ) . These variants included natural repeat lengths , as well as extremely short and long forms . This set of mutants allowed us to explore the outcomes of natural variability , as well as com - plete loss or long expansions of Q - rich repeats in Ssn6 controlled by its native promoter , in an otherwise isogenic background . As TR2 shows higher variability within the natural strains , we chose nine TR2 variants ( natural variations : TR2 - 33 , TR2 - 55 , TR2 - 63 ; short variants : TR2 - 0 , TR2 - 14 , TR2 - 20 , TR2 - 27 ; long variants : TR2 - 90 , TR2 - 105 ) to investigate the inﬂuence of Q - rich repeats on gene - expression regulation . Using RNA sequencing , we pro - ﬁled the transcriptome of the SSN6 TR2 variants in glucose - rich medium and during carbon starvation .

See also Figures S1 and S2 and Tables S1 and S2 . Molecular Cell 59 , 615 – 627 , August 20 , 2015 ª 2015 The Authors 617 showed signiﬁcant changes in expression ( log 2 fold - change cut - off of 0 . 8 and false discovery rate ( FDR ) p < 0 . 01 ) in either the SSN6 TR2 deletion ( TR2 - 0 ) or expansion ( TR2 - 105 ) variant compared with the WT strain ( TR2 - 63 ) in either culture condi - tions ( Table S4 ) . To further discriminate between noise and targets whose regulation is directly inﬂuenced by SSN6 TR2 number variation , we computed the autocorrelation function , which detects non - randomness in data , considering the SSN6 TR2 number as a series . By selecting SSN6 target genes that showed an autocorrelation coefﬁcient R 0 . 2 and the same expression trend in at least two consecutive repeat variants , we identiﬁed 89 targets whose regulation was TR2 length dependent ( Figure 3A ) . In the carbon - starved condition , we observe a positive corre - lation between the length of TR2 and the expression levels of a subset of genes ( Group 1 ) and an inverse correlation for a second subset of genes ( Group 2 ) ( Figure 3A , left ) . Interestingly , for a number of targets belonging to Group 2 , the expression in - creases again in the longest TR2 expansion variant ( TR2 - 105 ) . In other words , for these genes , the effect of SSN6 repeat dele - tion or long expansion is identical ( see Discussion ) . In glucose - rich medium , the expression of the majority of targets follows an inverse correlation with TR2 length . Here again , expression in the TR2 - 105 variant is comparable to the TR2 - 0 variant for a subset of genes ( Figure 3A , right ) . We conﬁrmed these expres - sion patterns by performing real - time qPCR measurements on seven target genes ( Figure S4A ) . Functional enrichment analysis revealed that the genes whose expression shows a direct correlation with TR2 ( Group 1 ) during carbon starvation are mostly involved in alternative carbon trans - port and metabolism , including key genes of gluconeogenesis ( PCK1 , FBP1 , ICL1 - 2 , MLS1 , IDP2 ) . Genes that show the oppo - site expression trend ( Group 2 ) are mostly involved in glycolysis ( MAE1 , CDC19 , ENO2 , GPM1 ) , ﬂocculation , and ﬁlamentous growth ( FLO11 , TIR3 , NRG1 , PHD1 ) or , notably , are TFs that ( physically ) interact with the Ssn6 - Tup1 complex ( YAP6 , CIN5 , NRG1 , PHD1 , SUT1 ) ( Hanlon et al . , 2011 ) ( Figure 3A , left ) . The genes whose expression in glucose - rich medium is anti - corre - lated with TR2 length are mostly involved in hexose transport and metabolism ( HXT5 - 6 - 7 , HXK1 ) , stress response ( GPH1 , HSP42 , HSP12 , GAD1 , TSL1 , DDR2 ) , or ﬂocculation and ﬁla - mentous growth ( FLO11 , FLO10 , BSC1 , HMS1 , MGA1 ) ( Fig - ure 3A , right ) . Importantly , we also ﬁnd several highly induced cytosolic chaperones , including the ‘‘antiaggregase’’ HSP26 , the inducible Hsp70 SSA4 , and HSP30 and HSP33 only in the TR2 - 0 or TR2 - 105 variants ( Table S4 ) , suggesting a response of the protein folding machinery to deletion or expansion of the Ssn6 repeat .

This network shows that most targets are connected to SSN6 through direct protein - DNA interactions with TFs ( CIN5 , PHD1 , YAP6 , NRG1 , and SUT1 ) that act as hub proteins connected to SSN6 by direct protein - DNA as well as protein - protein interac - tions . Furthermore , we ﬁnd signiﬁcant overlap between the genes whose expression is identiﬁed as SSN6 TR2 - dependent in this study and ( 1 ) de - repressed genes upon Tup1 nuclear depletion ( Wong and Struhl , 2011 ) and ( 2 ) SSN6 target pro - moters identiﬁed by chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) ( Ven - ters et al . , 2011 ) ( Figure 3C ) . This observation , along with the fact that most genes identiﬁed by our RNA - seq could be included in an interaction network , suggests that these genes are bona ﬁde SSN6 targets and that the observed changes in their expression are most likely a direct consequence of changes in the number of SSN6 TR2 . To investigate whether this variation in gene expression under changing nutrient availability has phenotypic consequences , we measured growth of the TR2 variants in alternative carbon or ni - trogen sources using the Phenotype MicroArrays ( Biolog ) . While we ﬁnd no signiﬁcant differences in growth when glucose is the sole carbon source , the ﬁtness of the variants increases linearly with TR2 number when fructose or galactose is used ( Figure 3D ) . Interestingly , this ﬁtness trend closely resembles the expression pattern of key genes involved in alternative carbon transport and metabolism ( highlighted in Figure 3A , left ) . Moreover , growth in sucrose mirrors the more complex expression pattern of SUC2 ( the major sucrose hydrolyzing enzyme ) ( highlighted in Figure 3A , right ) and growth in the presence of a - Amino - N - Valeric Acid ( Norvaline ) as the sole nitrogen source is anti - correlated with TR2 number ( Figure 3D ) . We next analyzed the SSN6 TR2 variants for phenotypes associated with FLO11 and IMA1 , two target genes ( highlighted in Figure 3B ) that underlie very speciﬁc and quantiﬁable pheno - types : FLO11 mediates complex colony morphology ( induced by growth on sucrose ) ( Voordeckers et al . , 2012b ) , invasive growth ( induced by glucose starvation ) ( Bru¨ckner and Mo¨sch , 2012 ) , adhesion to plastic ( Reynolds and Fink , 2001 ) , and ﬂoc - culation ( Verstrepen and Klis , 2006 ) , while IMA1 is a glucosi - dase required for growth on palatinose ( a naturally occurring disaccharide ) ( Brown et al . , 2010 ; Voordeckers et al . , 2012a ) . All the Flo11 - related phenotypes presented a common response to variation in SSN6 TR2 number : colonies showed more ‘‘wrinkled’’ surfaces , stronger agar invasion and plastic adhesion , and higher ﬂocculation levels in the short SSN6 TR2 variants ( Figure 4D ) . These phenotypes gradually decrease with increasing TR2 number . On the other hand , the Ima1 - dependent growth rates on palatinose closely follow Ima1 levels in these TR2 variants ( Figure 4D ) . Together , this analysis dem - onstrates that Ssn6 TR2 variation results in changes in the expression levels of its target genes and also results in corre - sponding changes in ﬁtness in different nutrient environments . Moreover , these transcriptomics and phenotypic data are in keeping with the results of the genome - scale analysis showing that the targets of Q - rich TFs are enriched in metabolic pro - cesses ( Figure S2B ) . To conﬁrm that Q - rich repeats can be functional domains in transcriptional regulators and that our main observations are not limited to Ssn6 , we investigated the effect of deletion of the polyQ repeat in Snf5 , a subunit of the SWI / SNF chromatin re - modeling complex in S . cerevisiae . Deletion of the polyQ resulted in lower expression of known Snf5 targets ( Figure S5A ) . Addition - ally , using a ﬂuorescent reporter for PHO84 ( a high - afﬁnity phos - phate transporter ) , we show that Snf5 polyQ deletion leads to lower steady - state expression of PHO84 and to differences in PHO84 induction in response to variable concentrations of extra - cellular phosphate ( Figure S5B ) . Together , these results show that the Q - rich repeat inﬂuences the function of Snf5 , similar to what we observed with Ssn6 . Variable SSN6 Repeats Contribute to Target Expression Noise We next asked whether SSN6 repeat variability affects the expression noise of its targets ( i . e . , stochastic cell - to - cell differ - ences in gene expression ) , as suggested by our genome - scale observations ( Figure 1B ) . We grew ﬂuorescent reporter strains of three targets ( FLO11 , IMA1 , and CIN5 ) identiﬁed by RNA - seq ( highlighted in Figure 3B ) in appropriate media for more than ten doublings , maintaining them at low cell density to ensure steady - state levels of expression . First , protein levels measured using reporter constructs closely follow the changes in mRNA levels , with the exception of Cin5 levels in the TR2 - 105 variant ( Figure 4A ) . Second , the ﬂuorescence distributions indicate that changes in SSN6 TR2 have target - speciﬁc effects on expression noise ( Figure 4B ) . Speciﬁcally , ﬂo11 : : YFP distribu - tions show remarkable variability between the TR2 variants ( Fig - ures 4B and 4C ) , whereas IMA1 - YFP distributions only show greater dispersion in the TR2 - 105 variant and CIN5 - RFP ﬂuores - cence is homogeneous between all the variants ( Figure 4B ) . This indicates that Q - rich repeat variation in the regulator could be one of the factors that contributes to expression noise and this effect is target dependent . Ssn6 Q - Rich Repeat Variation Results in Changes in Its Stability and Interactome How does repeat variation lead to changes in Ssn6 function ? Quantitative real - time PCR analysis showed that the expression of SSN6 is similar in all the TR2 variants and does not differ signif - icantly from the WT allele ( TR2 - 63 ) ( Figure S4B ) . Moreover , expanded SSN6 repeats ( TR2 - 105 ) are stable over multiple ( > 30 ) generations ( Figure S6A ) , ruling out that TR2 repeat hetero - geneity within a population would be responsible for the increased expression noise in some Ssn6 targets . To check for changes in the Ssn6 stability and interactome , we fused the Ssn6 repeat variants ( TR2 - 0 , TR2 - 55 , TR2 - 63 , TR2 - 90 , and TR2 - 105 ) to six copies of an HA epitope tag at their C termi - nus . Using gel - bound anti - HA antibodies , we isolated the tagged Ssn6 from soluble protein extracts . Bound proteins were sepa - rated by SDS - PAGE , followed by in - gel digestion and identiﬁca - tion by mass spectrometry ( Figure 5A , left ) . This qualitative approach shows that the interactomes of the repeat deletion and expansion variants are larger than that of the WT and also contain common elements ( Figure 5A , left ) . Notably , these com - mon interactors are involved in active chromatin remodeling Molecular Cell 59 , 615 – 627 , August 20 , 2015 ª 2015 The Authors 619 Figure 3 .

To conﬁrm these results and to accurately quantify TR2 - dependent changes in the Ssn6 interactome , we repeated the pull - down experiment and eluted the antibody - bound protein complexes . The eluted fractions were digested , and the peptide mixtures from the WT were labeled with a light isotope ( 12 C 3 - propionate ) , while those from the TR2 variants were labeled with a heavy isotope ( 13 C 3 - propi - onate ) . The labeled peptides from each TR2 variant and the WT were mixed 1 : 1 and analyzed by liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry ( LC - MS / MS ) ( Figure 5A , right ) . Among the 85 proteins detected , we considered the ones identiﬁed by at least two different peptides in all ﬁve TR2 variants tested ( Table S5 ) . We ﬁnd > 2 - fold depletion of Ssn6 and its known interaction part - ner Tup1 in the TR2 - 105 variant relative to the WT ( Figure 5A , right ) . Concurrently , we ﬁnd a signiﬁcant enrichment of the Hsp70 chaperone Ssa2 in the TR2 expansion ( TR2 - 90 and TR2 - 105 ) and deletion ( TR2 - 0 ) variants . Ssa2 is a cytosolic chap - erone required for protein folding , translocation , and degrada - tion of unfolded proteins . It also partners with Hsp40 co - chaper - ones to promote the refolding of aggregated or unfolded proteins ( Verghese et al . , 2012 ) . Interestingly , we ﬁnd that Ssa2 co - local - izes with expanded Ssn6 in the nucleus , but not with the WT or TR2 - 0 variant ( Figure 5B ) . To assess whether Ssa2 is required for proper Ssn6 func - tioning , we deleted this chaperone in the ﬂo11 : : YFP reporter strains . In general , we observed higher FLO11 levels in the D ssa2 background relative to the parental strains , indicative of a loss of ( repressive ) Ssn6 function ( Figure 5C ) . The most dra - matic functional change is observed in the TR2 - 105 variant , where median ﬂo11 : : YFP levels increase (cid:3) 20 - fold in the absence of Ssa2 and become homogeneous within the popula - tion ( less expression noise ) ( Figure 5C ) . The involvement of Ssa2 points to a TR2 - dependent effect on the conformational dynamics of Ssn6 . Aggregation is an intrinsic property of glutamine - rich repeats , and its propensity increases with repeat number ( Krobitsch and Lindquist , 2000 ) . Using ﬂuo - rescence microscopy on Ssn6 - YFP fusion proteins , we checked whether Ssn6 formed inclusions . We did not detect any inclu - sions in actively dividing cells ( not shown ) , but when cells reached the stationary phase , the TR2 - 105 variant formed nuclear inclusions visible as bright foci ( Figure 5D ) . Notably , deletion of Ssa2 leads to an increase in ﬂuorescent foci in the TR2 - 105 variant and even the appearance of foci in the WT as well as in the TR2 - 0 variant ( Figure 5D ) . This suggests that Ssa2 maintains proper Ssn6 folding and counteracts its intrinsic property to aggregate . We did not detect any change in the sub - cellular localization of Ssn6 - YFP in any TR2 variant ( not shown ) . Under speciﬁc experimental conditions , Ssn6 can misfold into self - templating prion - like amyloid ﬁbers ( Patel et al . , 2009 ) . To determine whether the TR2 - 105 inclusions were prion aggre - gates , we devised a strategy to detect protein - only ( i . e . , non - mendelian ) inheritance typical of prions . We crossed the TR2 - 105 variant with the TR2 - 0 variant or with the WT strain and scored the progeny for its colony morphology on YP - sucrose . TR2 - 105 colonies are smooth , TR2 - 0 very wrinkled , and TR2 - 63 moderately wrinkled on YP - sucrose . In both crosses , the morphology of the resulting progeny followed 2 : 2 segregation ( Figure S6B ) , indicating mendelian inheritance of phenotype and ruling out Ssn6 prionization under these conditions . To provide direct biochemical evidence that repeat expansion results in misfolding and aggregation of Ssn6 , we performed an aggregation assay to assess the soluble and insoluble fractions of Ssn6 in the different TR2 variants ( Figure 5E ) . While more than 80 % of the WT Ssn6 can be found in the soluble fraction , almost 60 % of TR2 - 105 and about 40 % of the short TR2 variants ( TR2 - 0 and TR2 - 55 ) of Ssn6 were recovered from the insoluble fraction ( Figure 5E ) . Ssn6 TR2 is predicted to adopt an a - helical coiled - coil structure ( Fiumara et al . , 2010 ) . To investigate whether this conformation is essential for Ssn6 function , we substituted two or three QA residues in the WT Ssn6 TR2 with single prolines , a strategy commonly employed for helix disruption ( Figure 5F ) . In these QA / P mutants , FLO11 levels are identical to those in the TR2 - 0 variant , indicating that partial or complete impairment of the TR2 structure results in loss of Ssn6 function ( Figure 5G ) . To further conﬁrm that repeat expansion causes effects directly related to Ssn6 function , rather than being a general conse - quence of aggregation of a Q - rich repeat , we overexpressed , in the WT , a construct bearing a long , aggregation - prone Q - rich repeat ( Krobitsch and Lindquist , 2000 ) . Our results show that expression of this artiﬁcial repeat does not have any effect on FLO11 expression ( Figure S6C ) , suggestingthat the observed ef - fects of TR2 variation are indeed directly related to Ssn6 function rather than being non - speciﬁc effects of polyQ aggregates . Together , these results indicate that the Q - rich repeat length modulates the interaction of Ssn6 and its partner Tup1 and main - tains a balance between correctly folded versus an aggregated Ssn6 and that Ssa2 is critical for maintaining a functional Ssn6 . DISCUSSION TRs are present in (cid:3) 20 % of genes in the human genome , yet their functional signiﬁcance is still not fully understood . In this study , we provide a detailed and direct investigation of the outcome of Q - rich repeat variation in a physiological context . We engineered S . cerevisiae strains that only differ in the number of repeats in the transcriptional regulator SSN6 ( CYC8 ) to mimic the natural repeat variation as well variations outside the natural range . We provide evidence that even moderate variations in Ssn6 repeat number result in detectable functional changes .

( legend continued on next page ) 622 Molecular Cell 59 , 615 – 627 , August 20 , 2015 ª 2015 The Authors These are likely caused by changes in Ssn6 solubility and interaction with other proteins , including its prime partner Tup1 ( Figure 6 ) . Our study thus shows that Q - rich repeat variation re - sults in changes in TF stability and interaction , which in turn leads to changes in the expression of its target genes and the pheno - types they control , supporting the notion that repeats could function as evolvable genetic tuning knobs of TF function ( King et al . , 1997 ) . Role of Variable Q - Rich Repeats in Modulating the Function of Ssn6 Q - rich repeats are enriched in transcriptional regulators in eu - karyotic genomes from yeasts to humans . We ﬁrst show , using genome - scale analyses in yeast , that targets of Q - rich regulators have higher expression variability across multiple timescales compared with targets of regulators devoid of repeats . We then experimentally demonstrate , using Q - rich repeat ( TR2 ) var - iants of the yeast Ssn6 , that repeat variation in a regulator results in expression changes of its direct targets ( Figure 3A ) . Interestingly , expression of some Ssn6 targets directly corre - lates with its TR2 length , whereas the expression of other targets follows an inverse trend . This is likely due to the fact that the Ssn6 - Tup1 complex acts as a transcriptional repressor for some targets ( Smith and Johnson , 2000 ) and a co - activator for others ( Papamichos - Chronakis et al . , 2002 ; Wong and Struhl , 2011 ) . In line with these observations , we ﬁnd that 22 of the 37 ( (cid:3) 60 % ) genes whose expression shows a positive correlation with SSN6 TR2 number ( Group 1 ) have Cat8 and / or Adr1 binding sites in their promoters ( Tachibana et al . , 2005 ) . These are car - bon - responsive transcriptional activators required for transcrip - tion in low glucose . On the other hand , 17 of the 29 ( (cid:3) 60 % ) genes whose expression follows an opposite trend to increasing SSN6 TR2 ( Group 2 ) contain Phd1 ( or its homolog Cin5 ) and / or Nrg1 sites in their promoters . The network analysis further dem - onstrates how Ssn6 can act as a master regulator controlling the expression of these key TFs that are both direct SSN6 targets themselves ( protein - DNA interactions ) and Ssn6 partners ( pro - tein - protein interactions ) ( Figure 3B ) . Moreover , deletion of the Q - rich repeat in another transcription regulator , Snf5 , resulted in similar changes in its target gene expression , suggesting that our observations for Ssn6 may represent a general phenomenon . The almost identical response of diverse targets to SSN6 repeat variation points to a common underlying mechanism . We found that Ssn6 solubility and its interaction with Tup1 depend on its TR2 length and that the helical conformation of TR2 is essential for Ssn6 function ( Figures 5F and 5G ) . This repeat region could behave as a ﬂexible hydrophilic tract that increases the solubility of Ssn6 and also allows its ﬂank - ing domains to come to spatial proximity , similar to the polyQ domain of huntingtin ( Caron et al . , 2013 ) . Repeat shortening or expansion could impair the ﬂexibility of this tract and consequently the conformational dynamics of Ssn6 . In addi - tion , Ssn6 repeat deletion or expansion variants acquire com - mon interactors ( Figure 5A ) , which could further contribute to the observed ( and in some cases identical ) functional changes . The Hsp70 chaperone Ssa2 likely counteracts the intrinsic , repeat - length dependent propensity of Ssn6 to aggregate . Contribution of Unstable Q - Rich Repeats to Phenotypic Diversity and Evolvability Expression divergence is key to the emergence of variable phe - notypes . Here we provide evidence that links SSN6 repeat - dependent gene expression variation to phenotypic diversity . The Ssn6 TR2 variants show clear differences in ﬁtness when grown on alternative carbon or nitrogen sources ( Figure 3D ) . Importantly , these changes in ﬁtness mirror the expression pat - terns of key metabolic genes induced during nutritional shifts ( Figure 3A ) . We also observe changes in multicellular growth forms in the TR2 variants that are directly linked to changes in FLO11 expression ( Figure 4D ) . These observations suggest that no single SSN6 repeat length offers optimal ﬁtness in different environments . It is therefore tempting to speculate that repeat - dependent variation in gene expression might help to increase the phenotypic evolvability as it facilitates the emer - gence of variants ﬁt in distinct environments . This would imply that the inherent instability of Q - rich repeats in TFs might in some cases be advantageous instead of purely neutral or even detrimental . Indeed , we observe that Ssn6 repeat expansion can , in some instances , have beneﬁcial outcomes ( e . g . , higher ﬁtness in alternative carbon sources ) . Chaperones like Ssa2 might help buffer the potentially negative effects of repeat vari - ation , except in times of stress where the chaperone system can be overstretched , which can lead to the uncovering of the previously buffered effects of Q - repeat variation ( Jarosz et al . , 2010 ) . Our results agree with previous studies that show correlations between variation in TRs and phenotypes ( Gemayel et al . , 2010 ) . A key study by Fondon and Garner ( 2004 ) implicated variable re - peats in the regulatory gene Runx - 2 as mediators of morpholog - ical evolution in domestic dogs . In Arabidopsis thaliana , variation in polyQ repeats of ELF3 , a component of the circadian clock , also leads to morphological changes ( Undurraga et al . , 2012 ) . Interestingly , in the human , mouse , and ﬂy genomes , polyQ tracts are preferentially encoded by pure CAG repeats ( Schaefer ( B ) Analytical ﬂow cytometry of single - cell ﬂuorescence distributions of SSN6 target genes in the TR2 variants . A representative histogram for ﬂo11 : : YFP ( promoter fusion ) , IMA1 - YFP , and CIN5 - RFP ( protein fusions ) in each TR2 variant is shown . Expression noise ( deﬁned by the standard deviation divided by the mean ﬂuorescence ; i . e . , magnitude of variability as a percentage of expression level ) ( Raser and O’Shea , 2004 ) was calculated from the ﬂuorescence distri - butions .

The plates were then washed under water to remove non - agar - invading cells ( post - wash ) . Growth rates in palatinose correlate with IMA1 expression . Data points represent mean ± SD , n = 3 .

This might indicate purifying ( negative ) selection , as without such selection , repeats are expected to gather non - synonymous mutations and consequently become less variable ( Legendre et al . , 2007 ) . Understanding the Pathogenesis of Polyglutamine Repeat Expansions While our study primarily describes the physiological role of polyQ repeats , there are also links to polyQ expansion pathogen - esis . First , our study shows how repeat variation in a regulator leads to changes in the expression of downstream targets and how repeat expansion beyond a certain threshold could lead to a global transcriptional dysregulation , a common observation in multiple polyQ expansion diseases ( Gatchel and Zoghbi , 2005 ) . In addition , we show that expanded Ssn6 acquires private interactors ( Figure 5A ) . In line with what has been previously documented , these interactors are mainly involved in transcrip - tion / translation , chromatin modiﬁcation , and protein folding ( Friedman et al . , 2007 ; Lam et al . , 2006 ; Park et al . , 2013 ; Schaf - far et al . , 2004 ) . The loss of key cellular regulators through aber - rant interactions ( Schaffar et al . , 2004 ) could also result in tran - scriptional dysregulation . Proteostasis is another factor contributing to polyQ pathogen - esis . PolyQ aggregates may not be directly responsible for path - ogenesis , but are rather remnants of an overwhelmed protea - some system ( Douglas and Dillin , 2010 ) . This ‘‘proteasome hijacking’’ mechanism is directly linked to the pathogenesis of polyQ aggregates ( Park et al . , 2013 ; Tsvetkov et al . , 2013 ) . Our study identiﬁes the Hsp70 chaperone Ssa2 as a key functional interactor of the Ssn6 - Tup1 complex . In the absence of Ssa2 , we observe increased aggregation of expanded Ssn6 ( TR2 - 105 ) . These ﬁndings highlight the importance of molecular chap - erones in counteracting the pathogenesis of polyQ expansions and consolidate the emerging notion that bolstering the proteo - stasis system might be a therapeutic target for neurodegenera - tive diseases ( Tsvetkov et al . , 2013 ) . In summary , our study establishes a direct link between Q - rich repeat variation and changes in transcription regulator function and demonstrates that repeats may be more than just potentially harmful elements in genomes . Instead , by modulating the proteostasis and the protein interactions of the regulator in which they reside , repeat domains may help tune the expression levels of target genes and diversify under - lying phenotypes . ( C ) Ssa2 maintains Ssn6 function . Analytical ﬂow cytometry proﬁles of ﬂo11 : : YFP in the TR2 variants and their D ssa2 counterparts show how deletion of SSA2 affects the expression of the FLO11 target gene . See also Figure S6 .

Model for a Functional Role of Variable Q - Rich Repeats in the Transcriptional Regulator Ssn6 Variation in the number of Q - rich repeats in Ssn6 may primarily affect the Hsp70 ( Ssa2 ) - mediated folding dynamics of this transcriptional regulator and its interaction with Tup1 and other regulators . The ensuing functional changes in Ssn6 result in repeat - length - dependent variation in the expression of genes involved in various cellular processes . These expression changes underlie phenotypic diversity ( e . g . , ﬂocculation strength ) .

A detailed explanation of the strategy used to create the SSN6 repeat variants in the S 1278b strain is provided in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures . Transcriptome Analysis Strains were grown overnight in YP 4 % glucose then inoculated in fresh me - dium at an OD 600 = 0 . 0005 and grown for 20 hr after which all samples had comparable ( (cid:3) 2 % ) glucose levels left . Each culture was subsequently divided intwo equal volumes . Onepellet was frozen at (cid:1) 80 (cid:4) C , andthe otherwas used to inoculate fresh YP medium with no glucose and incubated for 2 hr at 30 (cid:4) C . Total RNA was isolated using the standard phenol - chloroform method ( Am - berd et al . , 2005 ) . For details on mRNA sequencing and analysis , see Supple - mental Experimental Procedures . Immunoprecipitation of Ssn6 Yeast cells were grown in YP 4 % glucose until exponential phase , transferred toYPmediumlackinganycarbonsourcefor2hr , andthenharvestedbycentri - fugation . Cell pellets were lysed by vortexing with glass beads in cold lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl [ pH 7 . 5 ] , 100 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 10 % glycerol , complete protease inhibitors ; Roche ) , and extracts were cleared twice by centrifugation ( 10min , 14 , 000rpmat4 (cid:4) C ) .
