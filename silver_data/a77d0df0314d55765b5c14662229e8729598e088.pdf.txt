Such capabilities are lacking in existing tools . Initial evaluation suggests that our proposal improves usability over existing tools , has novel parameter space exploration capabilities , and also reveals a space for designing direct interactions with visualizations to support parametric exploration . Author Keywords Interactive visualization ; parallel coordinates ; sliders ; de - sign space exploration ; parametric modeling ; Architectural Design CCS Concepts • Human - centered computing → Graphical user inter - faces ; Information visualization ; Introduction Designers explore and synthesize multiple alternative so - lutions in a problem space [ 25 ] . However , most extant de - sign tools poorly support simultaneous alternatives . This inadequacy may be partly attributed to the nearly universal Single State Document Model [ 29 ] , where the document is allowed to exist in only one state , which is at odds with the creative process . Design tools should allow the setup , mod - LBW289 , Page 1 CHI 2020 Late - Breaking Work CHI 2020 , April 25 – 30 , 2020 , Honolulu , HI , USA iﬁcation , and comparison of several alternative scenarios simultaneously [ 29 , 19 ] . Working with alternatives results in more diverse design outcomes and improves task self - conﬁdence [ 10 ] , more credible evaluation of design work and better problem identiﬁcation [ 31 ] . Architectural design , especially in its early stages , presents high variability in both problem ( the goals to be met ) and solution ( the design to meet goals ) . Some aspects of both problem and solution can be explicitly represented , while others remain implicit and often only tacitly perceived by designers . Architectural design representations typically provide various 2D and 3D views to support implicit aspects ( such as composition and views ) and a variety of tools to report explicit goals ( such as cost and energy ) . Here we focus on the currently popular parametric modeling design representation , which both provides and requires an ex - plicit symbolic model that computes a solution from varying inputs and measures its explicit goals through outputs pro - duced by the model . Using parametric modeling designers work through a reﬂection - action cycle to develop , reﬁne and explore these symbolic models . Parametric modeling supports exploring several design al - ternatives by varying input parameters and observing the change in geometry and computed outputs [ 35 ] . However , in all popular parametric modelers , this trial - and - error style of exploration [ 24 ] allows only viewing one alternative at a time and poses user experience challenges to compar - ing and modifying several alternatives simultaneously [ 7 ] . Parametric models yield abstract , multi - dimensional data spaces comprising of input and output parameters , and ge - ometry or images [ 34 , 24 ] . For such data spaces , dynamic , ‘what - if’ , and incremental exploration capabilities are rec - ommended [ 3 , 26 ] . This is well supported by sliders [ 2 , 26 ] . Sliders are also the default UI element in parametric model - ers to vary input parameters . We propose interactive parallel coordinates - based widget , which behave like “parallel sliders” , that allows the dynamic exploration and comparison of several parametric alterna - tives simultaneously . We named it the Parallel Coordinate Controller ( PCC ) . Related Work Previews of command applications or parameter settings support experimentation and comparison of several po - tential solutions in image editing and rendering [ 30 , 20 ] , while linked parallel setup of alternatives is shown to ben - eﬁt task completion , satisfaction and solution quality [ 19 , 30 , 12 ] . Dream Lens [ 21 ] supports exploration of large gen - erative design data - sets by juxtaposed comparison using various visualization techniques and selection from super - posed images . Design Explorer 2 [ 1 ] offers sort - able juxta - posed thumbnail images with parallel coordinate plots and a scatter - plot matrix of user generated design data . GEM - NI [ 37 ] —a graph - based vector graphics editor , lets users “skate” through history of command applications to create new graphics and supports merging and recombining of previously created alternatives to generate new ones . Parallel arrangement of data attributes has been employed for exploration , evaluation , and synthesis of light - bulb de - signs in the Inﬂuence Explorer [ 33 , 34 ] . Parallel coordinate plot ( PCP ) based interfaces are proposed for geometry ex - ploration [ 6 , 9 ] . The ARL trade space visualizer ( ATSV ) [ 28 ] contains multiple , interactive , and coordinated visual encod - ings ( 2 - D scatterplots , 2 - D glyph plots , parallel coordinates , 1 - D and 2 - D histograms ) with sampling based data genera - tion and exploration tools . Tory et al . [ 32 ] propose an inter - face where volume rendering attribute values are arranged LBW289 , Page 2 CHI 2020 Late - Breaking Work CHI 2020 , April 25 – 30 , 2020 , Honolulu , HI , USA Figure 1 : ( a ) A re - sizeable and movable collection with ﬁve alternatives . ( b ) A selected alternative . ( c ) A selected alternative currently hovered in the PCC , shown in Figure 2 . in a parallel coordinate - style plot . Chaining these values by drawing a polyline connecting them composes the ren - dering function . Alternatives of resulting images can be generated by editing the connecting polyline . From the pre - viously cited examples [ 20 , 21 , 1 , 28 , 33 , 6 , 9 ] are entirely visualization based and allow comparison of pre - generated data sets but do not allow modiﬁcation or synthesis of al - ternatives , neither individually nor in parallel . The other ex - amples [ 37 , 32 , 19 , 30 ] allow synthesis and modiﬁcation but have rudimentary object comparison capabilities . Our proposal supports comparing large sets of alternatives , and rich interactions for manual synthesis and exploration . Design and Salient Features Our previous work [ 22 , 36 ] allows alternatives created in parametric modelers to be saved to and restored from a gallery , where they appear as collections interactive thumb - nails , 3D models , and a key - value list of input and output parameter values . The thumbnails and collections can be spatially arranged by dragging their boxes . The alterna - tives can be tagged , and queried by parameter values . The PCC is an additional view of this key - value data in typical parallel - coordinates style . Each input and output parameter forms an axis of the PCC . Alternatives are represented by poly - lines that join circular handles marking the correspond - ing numeric value of each parameter for that alternative . Like typical parallel - coordinate implementations , axes can be turned on or off , re - arranged , and ranges of values can be selected per axis , resulting in brushing of alternatives ( see Figure 2 ) . Brushing and selection is coordinated [ 23 ] across thumbnails and a work - in - progress scatter - plot view . Our design features vertically stacked axes to match sliders in parametric modelers , while also noting that multi - variate patterns revealed by parallel coordinates are unaffected by afﬁne transformation [ 16 ] . Figure 2 : PCC of the same collection of ﬁve alternatives in Figure 1 . ( a ) Parameters to be visualized can be chosen from a dropdown menu . Input axes are ( d ) output axes are ( e ) . ( b ) and ( c ) are the same selected alternatives ( c ) is currently being hovered . Hovering brings the item to the top . Hovering nearing a handle shows value in tooltip . ( c ) has one output value ( Retail Area ) less than the unselected ( grey ) alternatives . ( b ) has one output value more ( Total Area ) than the rest . This difference implies that the user may choose not to include certain parameters while saving alternatives from the modeler to the gallery . Axes can be reordered by dragging handles ( f ) . Note that the output areas show strong positive linear correlation with each other in this model , hence the nearly straight output plots . LBW289 , Page 3 CHI 2020 Late - Breaking Work CHI 2020 , April 25 – 30 , 2020 , Honolulu , HI , USA Figure 3 : Parallel editing of alternatives ( a ) and ( b ) in progress ( see Figure 4 ) . Thumbnails indicate processing has begun and on completion of computation , the images and the output plots will update . Novel Interactions We propose the following interactions , that are entirely novel to the best of our knowledge , to enable modiﬁcation and synthesis of multiple alternatives simultaneously . 1 . Parallel Editing —Selecting several alternatives and dragging any input parameter handle causes all han - dles for that parameter to move in tandem . The al - ternatives are recomputed by a cloud server with the new input values . The thumbnails and output values update live . Several parameters may be selected for parallel editing , allowing multi - dimensional exploration ( see Figures 3 and 4 ) . 2 . Sketching —A new alternative may be generated by drawing a poly - line across input parameter axes , by connecting existing handles , or a combination of both ( see Figure 5 ) . The user may skip drawing or con - necting some input parameters , in which case , new alternatives are generated by substituting missing val - ues from already selected alternatives . This results in rapid generation of new alternatives without having to edit many parameters . 3 . Automated generation — Instead of fully automated exhaustive sampling of parameter spaces , designers prefer direct engagement and manual exploration [ 5 ] . We implemented the Cartesian Product ( CP ) gen - erator , already found to be beneﬁcial in our previous work [ 22 ] because this let users generate new alter - natives automatically from their previous manual ex - plorations . Users select two or more alternatives , and new alternatives are generated from the CP of the in - put parameter values ( See Figure 6 ) . The number of results may be reduced by restricting the number of parameters to include in the CP , or by using only the extreme values of parameters . Figure 4 : Parallel editing of two selected alternatives ( a ) and ( b ) . In ( 1 ) handle of ( a ) at BaseRotation is dragged from value 0 . 9 to 1 . 2 . BaseRotation value of ( b ) moves in tandem by equal amount . Values may be entered directly into the appearing tooltip , and the delta will be applied across selected alternatives . In ( 2 ) Dragging multiple sets of handles across multiple axes enables multi - parametric parallel editing . LBW289 , Page 4 CHI 2020 Late - Breaking Work CHI 2020 , April 25 – 30 , 2020 , Honolulu , HI , USA Figure 5 : Creating a new alternative by " sketching " a polyline across axes . It may be achieved by double - clicking on desired points on the axes ( cursor ) or by a smooth drawing action ( dotted line ) . The handles of the resulting green line can then be adjusted by dragging before committing to the values . Existing handles may also be clicked . A new alternative is computed by applying these values to a default model . Skipped values will be determined from selected alternatives . Thus , users can rapidly generate new alternatives by sketching few selected parameters for variation . Evaluation We conducted informal interviews to “probe for utility and usability” [ 18 ] of our design . We demonstrated to or allowed “casual play” by thirty ( n = 30 ) participants , comprising ex - pert practitioners , usability experts , industry leaders , tool builders , and academia , in the domain of parametric mod - eling in architecture . We approached these participants opportunistically at conferences , workshops , professional meet - ups , and personally . We asked general questions like what they thought of the tool , how they would use it , what beneﬁt they saw , what shortcomings it had and how to over - come them , and if they had any suggestion for its capabil - ities . We took notes or audio recordings , which were later transcribed . The data was analysed by open , axial , and se - lective coding [ 27 ] . All participants strongly welcomed the idea of using such a tool and that the capability of parallel editing and sketching new alternatives would be beneﬁcial to exploring alternatives using parametric modeling . We found participants’ responses centered around three concepts to which we assigned labels : 1 ) generation or modiﬁcation , 2 ) visualization and presentation , and 3 ) in - puts and outputs . Since participants’ repeatedly mentioned using inputs and outputs to generate or modify alternatives , and how the visualizations played a role , these related con - cepts gave rise to two core themes that answered our re - search question on utility and usability . They are as follows . 1 . Improved Usability Over Existing Tools and Approaches • “Live connection with modeler” – – the ability to interac - tively restore alternatives to the parametric modeler was preferred over the tools cited as related work above that require designs to be pre - generated . The latter is undesirable possibly due to premature com - mitment , lack of progressive evaluation and high vis - cosity ( see Cognitive Dimensions [ 11 ] ) . • Use as a “presentation tool” —participants agreed that the prototype was a good analytic tool to present design alternatives to different stakeholders . It con - tains better features for organization , such as col - lections and tags , and better query capabilities , i . e . , brushing using PCC and querying by values , com - pared to examples in related work . • “Standalone” model editing tool —the capability to edit models in the “cloud” independent of the para - metric modeling software elicited the highest posi - tive responses . It was claimed that this could allow clients to experiment with the model without worrying about losing original content , like a “sand - box” . One participants claimed that they would use the gallery and PCC to explore their designs remotely from a lightweight portable device . Another remarked they would use the cloud computation capability to gener - ate large batches of alternatives . 2 . Utility as a Novel Design Exploration Tool ( Current Form and Future Extensions ) One participant stated that they would presume any per - ceived “gaps” in the PCC represented “unexplored” design space – i . e . parameter values that had not been explored , and that they would expect sketching a line through such gaps , to include both inputs and outputs , should return the feasibility of such an alternative or its nearest neighbor . An - other asked , “Can you draw over outputs ? ” This suggests rich interactions that can be designed around ‘sketching’ or modifying of outputs , along the lines of inverse design [ 8 ] , where alternatives are computed from speciﬁed output val - ues . Experts made many suggestions for using the PCC to interactively generate new alternatives , e . g . , using a single alternative as the argument to generate a “parameter spec - trum” [ 29 ] for a sensitivity analysis in the neighborhood of LBW289 , Page 5 CHI 2020 Late - Breaking Work CHI 2020 , April 25 – 30 , 2020 , Honolulu , HI , USA Figure 6 : A schematic diagram of a Cartesian Product operator . In ( 1 ) , one whole alternative ( a ) has been selected . Partial parameter sets ( b ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) have been selected from other alternatives . ( 2 ) shows the computed result in the PCC . Visually , it is the set of lines exhaustively connecting all parameter values selected for the operation . For each new alternative computed , a new thumbnail appears in the gallery . selected input values ; using input ranges as constraints and outputs values as goals to trigger optimization algorithms , often used with parametric modeling [ 7 ] ; and using selec - tions of parts of an alternative to update other alternatives simultaneously . One reviewer used the phrase “work - shop feel” to describe using the gallery for tasks involving multi - ple what - if scenarios . Another described the PCC as com - bining engineering inquiry with visual play over designs . None of these operations are practical in a parametric mod - eler’s single state interface , which is more evidence of en - hanced usability . Conclusion and Future Work Our ﬁndings not only suggest validation of our design di - rections , but also suggest a rich design space of interac - tions to support parametric exploration of alternatives in novel ways . Such interactions can be extended to other visual encodings , such as the scatter - plot view which is better than parallel coordinates at revealing bi - variate re - lationships [ 15 ] . For example , a point in a bi - variate input parameter plot could also be dragged to a new XY value to modify existing alternatives , or new points may be placed on the plot to generate new alternatives with those values . We acknowledge that currently we support a modest num - ber of alternatives with limited parameters per alternative , and only numerical values . However , literature on parallel coordinates have several available solutions for both prob - lems , e . g . , plotting high - dimensional large datasets [ 13 ] and representing categorical data [ 17 ] . Parametric models are unpredictable and often discontinuous functions . Output parameter values can vary arbitrarily . Thus with every new computed alternative , the scales of the output axes may change . In this case , uniform scaling is difﬁcult , and scaling based on normalization by median and quartile , or mean and standard deviation [ 4 ] are possible solutions . We also note that parallel coordinates are used for pattern detection in data [ 14 , 13 ] . These patterns or relationships are visi - ble from the shape of the plot or clusters , rather than exact values . An example is positive linear correlation visible as straight lines in Figures 2 and 4 . Also , the parametric model is constantly modiﬁed as the design problem formulation changes [ 7 ] , resulting in addition or deletion of parameters and changed model behavior . We account for this partially in Figure 2 ( d , e ) , as we investigate using ways of represent - ing altered models as categorical variables . We plan to ad - dress these shortcomings , implement relevant user sug - gestions , and conduct a study with participants performing a design exploration task to analyze 1 ) design exploration behavior and novel uses of the tool ; and measure whether 2 ) user experience , creativity support , and design quality is improved in comparison to existing tools and methods .
