ATP hydro - lysis triggered by actin assembly provides the struc - tural cues for ﬁlament turnover in vivo . Here , we present the cryo - electron microscopic ( cryo - EM ) structure of ﬁlamentous actin ( F - actin ) in the pres - ence of phosphate , with the visualization of some a - helical backbones and large side chains . A complete atomic model based on the EM map identiﬁed intermolecular interactions mediated by bound magnesium and phosphate ions . Comparison of the F - actin model with G - actin monomer crystal structures reveals a critical role for bending of the conserved proline - rich loop in triggering phosphate release following ATP hydrolysis . Crystal structures of G - actin show that mutations in this loop trap the catalytic site in two intermediate states of the ATPase cycle . The combined structural information allows us to propose a detailed molecular mecha - nism for the biochemical events , including actin polymerization and ATPase activation , critical for actin ﬁlament dynamics . INTRODUCTION The actin - ﬁlament system is required in almost all cytoplasmic processes , including cell adhesion , motility , cellular signaling , intracellular trafﬁcking , and cytokinesis . Although stable actin ﬁlaments ( F - actin ) are necessary during muscle contraction , the active turnover of ﬁlaments is required in many cell functions . Actin has two major domains separated by a nucleotide - binding cleft ( Kabsch et al . , 1990 ) . The outer domain is divided into sub - domains 1 and 2 and the inner domain into subdomains 3 and 4 . All of the subdomains interact with the bound nucleotide . ATP is hydrolyzed at the rate of 1 / 3 . 3 s (cid:1) 1 following the elongation of ﬁla - ments at the growing end of ﬁlaments ( Blanchoin and Pollard , 2002 ) , whereas the phosphate release is 100 times slower ( Carlier and Pantaloni , 1986 ) . As a result , newly polymerized ﬁla - ments consist of stable ADP - Pi actin ( abbreviated as F - ADP - Pi ) , whereas the older ﬁlaments contain mainly ADP actin ( F - ADP ) , which disassembles more rapidly ( Carlier and Pantaloni , 1986 ) . Under physiological conditions , inorganic phosphate ( Pi ) binds to F - actin and reduces the critical concentration for polymeriza - tion ( Rickard and Sheterline , 1986 ; Fujiwara et al . , 2007 ) . Actin dynamics also depends on the identity of the bound divalent cation , physiologically Mg 2 + , associated with the bound nucleo - tide ( Carlier et al . , 1986 ) . Although a vast amount of biochemical data has been accu - mulated , the quest for a deﬁnitive and detailed molecular mech - anism of the polymerization of monomeric actin ( G - actin ) to ﬁla - mentous actin ( F - actin ) has been hampered by the inherent ﬂexibility of actin ﬁlament . The ﬂexibility has not allowed an atomic structure of F - actin to be determined . More than 50 atomic structures of G - actin bound with ATP or ADP have been determined since 1990 ( Kabsch et al . , 1990 ) , but F - actin has been visualized to relatively moderate resolution either by three - dimensional ( 3D ) image reconstruction from electron micrographs ( Belmont et al . , 1999 ) or modeling based on X - ray ﬁber diagrams ( Holmes et al . , 1990 ; Lorenz et al . , 1993 ) . The inherent ﬂexibility of actin ﬁlaments hampers determination of atomic structure . Recently , a new model of F - actin based on improved X - ray ﬁber diffraction analysis was reported ( Oda et al . , 2009 ) . Oda et al . proposed that outer - domain movement upon assembly ﬂattens the actin molecule in the polymer , similar to the case of the bacterial actin homolog MreB ( van den Ent et al . , 2001 ) , Cell 143 , 275 – 287 , October 15 , 2010 ª 2010 Elsevier Inc . 275 A B C F D E 276 Cell 143 , 275 – 287 , October 15 , 2010 ª 2010 Elsevier Inc . and that the DNase I binding loop ( DNase I loop ) adopts an open loop conformation . However , the mechanism of ATP hydrolysis and its coupling with actin assembly remains poorly understood . Here , we present cryo - electron microscopic ( cryo - EM ) data in which single - particle analysis has been applied to short and relatively straight stretches of ﬁlaments , with Pi added in the millimolar range ( similar to the intracellular Pi concentration ) , to further minimize ﬁlament ﬂexibility ( Nonomura et al . , 1975 ) . The quality of the cryo - EM images was further reﬁned as described in the Experimental Procedures . The resolution of the ﬁnal reconstruction was estimated to be (cid:3) 5 A˚ ( Fourier shell correlation [ FSC ] of 0 . 143 at 4 . 7 A˚ , a criterion according to Rosenthal and Henderson [ 2003 ] ) or (cid:3) 8 A˚ ( FSC of 0 . 5 at 7 . 8 A˚ , a traditional criterion ) , and some of the a - helical backbones and large side chains can be directly observed . This indicates that the data quality was sufﬁcient to visualize the structural changes upon polymerization and allowed us to build a quasi - atomic model of F - actin ( F - ADP + Pi ) . Putative Mg 2 + - binding sites and Pi - binding sites of F - actin , which play an important role in actin assembly , were identiﬁed in the EM map , and the proline ( Pro ) - rich loop ( residues 108 – 112 ) was observed to adopt a more bent conﬁguration that would trigger a phosphate - releasing pathway . Crystal structures of G - actin with mutations in this loop , in which the ATPase activity was increased or decreased , further revealed the region required for Pi release ( the so - called back - door region ; Wriggers and Schulten , 1999 ) and the atomic details of the mechanism of ATP hydrolysis . The combined structural information sheds new light on the coupling mechanism of ATP hydrolysis and F - actin assembly . RESULTS Overall Structure of Actin in a Filament The 3D cryo - EM structure was reconstructed from segments containing 26 actin molecules ( Figure 1B ) . Approximately 8000 actin molecules from zero energy - loss cryo - EM images of actin ﬁlaments in the presence of phosphate ( Figure 1A ) contributed to the ﬁnal EM map ( Figure 1 and Figure S1 avail - able online ) . A quasi - atomic model ( Figures 1B and 1D ) was constructed by reﬁning the initial F - actin model consisting of 26 G - ADP actin molecules ( Rould et al . , 2006 ) to obtain a good ﬁt into the EM density map ( see Figure S1 , Movie S1 , Movie S2 , and Figure 1E for FSC and ﬁgure - of - merit [ FOM ] plots ) . The resolution of the structure of F - actin appeared to be nonuniform depending on the regions ( Figure 1E ) . In the region where three actin molecules interact within the ﬁlament , the quality of EM map was better ( Figure 1E ) and the backbone structure of a helices 5 and 6 ( h5 , residues 183 – 196 ; h6 , resi - dues 207 – 216 ) and the Thr - rich loop ( residues 197 – 204 ) could be clearly resolved , allowing the assignment of some large side chains such as Lys191 , Tyr198 , and Arg206 ( Figures 1C and 1D ) . Although no b structure could be directly visualized , most a helices and loops deﬁned in Figure 2C could be assigned . The N - terminal segment ( residues 1 – 5 ) , h0 ( residues 41 – 48 ) in the middle of DNase I loop , and h7 ( mobile helix : residues 226 – 230 ) were less clearly resolved but still allowed main - chain placement except for the h0 segment , which is disordered . The structural details are shown in Figures S1F – S1H . Outer - Domain Rotation and Widening of Hydrophobic Cleft In the F - actin structure , the relation between the two major actin domains is different from that in G - actin . The outer domain is found rotated in a swing - door manner by (cid:3) 16 (cid:4) relative to the inner domain ( Figure 2A ) . The pivoting point , Asp154 next to P loop 2 , is located near the bound nucleotide , with two hinges : Gln137 - Ala138 and Lys336 - Tyr337 ( Figures 2A and 2C ) . The axis of the rotation was oriented by (cid:3) 40 (cid:4) relative to the ﬁlament helix axis ( Figure 2A ) and not vertical to the helix axis ( Oda et al . , 2009 ) ( Figure S2 ) . The outer - domain rotation enables the DNase I loop to ﬁt in the rear half of the hydrophobic cleft ( Figure 1F ) so that it could reach Leu110 , which can be clearly assigned in Figure 1 .

For its calculation , the region enclosed in a cosine - edged cylinder with a diameter of 36 . 4 A˚ and a height of 22 . 8 A˚ ( covering (cid:3) 44 % of the whole molecular volume ) was used .

As a result of the outer - domain rota - tion ( Figure 2A ) , the front half of the hydrophobic cleft is widened , making the side chain of Tyr143 more solvent exposed and increasing the distance between Tyr143 and Leu346 on the hydrophobic helix ( h12 ) ( Figure 2B ) . The importance of the front half of the hydrophobic cleft for polymerization is further high - lighted by the fact that the Dictyostelium actin with Tyr143Phe mutation polymerizes poorly . The Tyr143Ile mutation , however , has only a small inhibitory effect on assembly ( Figure 2D ) . This is consistent with the fact that the corresponding residue of the bacterial actin homolog MreB is Ile ( van den Ent et al . , 2001 ) . The front half of the hydrophobic cleft is also a primary site for G - actin - and / or F - actin - binding proteins , which could regulate actin assembly by promoting or blocking the widening of the hydrophobic cleft . Indeed , small marine toxins such as kabiri - mide C and jaspisamide A ( Klenchin et al . , 2003 ) , which bind to the front half of the hydrophobic cleft and sever actin ﬁlament , are sterically compatible with our F - actin structure . This may partially account for the inhibitory effect of modiﬁcation of Cys374 with tetramethylrhodamine ( TMR ) on polymerizability ( Otterbein et al . , 2001 ) . Structural Changes in the Intermolecular Interface Accompanying the domain rotation , the main - chain atoms shift more than 4 . 8 A˚ mainly in the loop regions ( Figure 2C ) , which facilitates intermolecular interactions . This results in a buried surface area between three actin molecules of up to 7646 A˚ 2 , which is a substantial increase compared to 2998 A˚ 2 for the crystal structure of G - ADP actin docked into the EM map without remodeling . At the interface of the three actins within the ﬁlament ( Figures 1C and 1D and Figure 3A ) , the Thr - rich loop ( containing Thr202 and Thr203 ) was remarkably different from that in G - actin ( shown in gray in Figure 3A ) . Furthermore , the N - terminal part of h6 was shifted compared to that in G - actin ( shown in gray in Figure 3A and Figure S1A ) and possibly stabi - lized by a putative salt bridge of Glu205 with Arg290 of the upper molecule and the hydrophobic interaction of Ala204 and Ile208 with Ile287 of the upper molecule . The disruption of h6 is observed in the crystal structure of the actin - DNase I complex ( Kabsch et al . , 1990 ) . Local reordering of the N - terminal part of h6 could provide a common binding site for actin - binding proteins , including actin itself , and could also help bind a magne - sium ion ( site 1 in Figure 3A ) and two phosphate ions ( Pi1 and Pi2 , Figure 1D ) .

In addi - tion , these mutants exhibit more disperse distribution when fused to GFP in Dictyostelium cells , with the double mutant dis - playing a more prominent phenotype ( Figure 3F ) . Phosphate - Binding Loops and Shifted Sensor Loop Both of two Pi - binding loops , P loop 1 ( residues 13 – 16 ) and P loop 2 ( residues 156 – 159 ) , could be assigned ( Figure 4B ) . They surrounded the densities that correspond to a - and b - phos - phates of the bound nucleotide , with no evidence for any g - phosphate density . The region , where the g - phosphate is located in the ATP form , is occupied by bulk solvent ( Figure 4B ) , indicating that F - actin has bound ADP in the ATPase site ( Figure 4B ) . Similar to the majority of crystal struc - tures of G - actin with ATP or ADP , the nucleotide - binding cleft ( Nolen and Pollard , 2007 ) is closed . However , the P loop 1 encir - cles a low - density region ( a bubble in the EM map ; Figure S4A ) , suggesting that two strands , s1 ( residues 8 – 11 ) and s2 ( residues 16 – 18 ) , might be dynamically deformed . This could allow accommodation of the outer - domain rotation . Consistent with this , NMR spectroscopy showed that residues 1 – 22 , which include P loop 1 , are mobile even in an F - actin state ( Heintz et al . , 1996 ) . The sensor loop ( residues 71 – 77 ) , which reﬂects the state of bound nucleotide of G - actin ( Rould et al . , 2006 ) , adopts a confor - mation similar to that of G - ADP ( Otterbein et al . , 2001 ; Rould et al . , 2006 ) ( Figure 3A ) . Compared with G - ATP actin , Glu72 on the sensor loop moves upwards by 2 A˚ and closer to Arg183 . This enables a putative salt bridge between Glu72 and Arg183 , which stabilize F - actin , as Arg183 is also associated with two phosphate ions . Magnesium - and Phosphate - Binding Sites of F - Actin Actin is known to have several binding sites for cations and phosphates ( Rickard and Sheterline , 1986 ; Carlier et al . , 1986 ) . Also , more than 50 crystal structures of G - actin have been determined , and magnesium - binding sites have been deduced ( Table 1 ; Klenchin et al . , 2006 ) . After several cycles of reﬁnement of the atomic model , a differ - ence map ( EM density minus the atomic model ) showed signiﬁ - cant peaks , greater than 3 s , with > 90 % conﬁdence by t test applied to three independently reconstructed EM maps ( Figure 3E and Figure S3 ) . The three strongest peaks ( s - values 5 . 2 , 5 . 9 , and 4 . 8 ) in the positively charged region ( Figures 3C and 3D ) are assigned as Pi ( HPO 42 (cid:1) ) because Pi was the only major anion in the specimens . The phosphate - binding sites 1 and 3 ( Table 1 ) are also observed in the crystal structure of G - actin , in which the sites are occupied by sulfate ions ( SO 42 (cid:1) ) . The EM data also supported the ﬁve magnesium - binding sites out of seven found in the crystal structures ( Klenchin et al . , 2006 ) . They have signiﬁcant densities in the EM difference map , with the peaks being more than 3 s ( Figure S3 ) and with > 90 % conﬁdence by the t test analysis . The FOM values increase when the ions are incorporated to the model . The peaks in the EM difference map were found in the same locations as the cations in the crystal structures of G - actin . Thus , the coordi - nating residues in the model are in essentially the same confor - mation as in the crystal structures of G - actin . The resultant atomic model of F - actin ( F - ADP + Pi ) included 5 Mg 2 + and 3 HPO 4 2 (cid:1) ions per actin protomer ( Figure S3 ) . Because Pi is located outside of the ATPase site , it is not designated as F - ADP - Pi . Two phosphate ions and two Mg 2 + ions bound to the inner domain appear to have a crucial role in the intermolecular inter - actions . Mg 2 + ions at site 1 and 2 would mediate longitudinal and oblique interactions , respectively ( Figure 3A and Figure S3A ) . This could explain the importance of Mg 2 + for actin assembly ( Laki et al . , 1962 ; Carlier et al . , 1986 ) . Mg 2 + at site 1 reinforces the vertical interaction through coordination with two acidic resi - dues , Asp288 and Glu207 on the vertically adjacent molecule . It also interacts with Gln59 of the actin molecule on the plus - end side . Consequently , Mg 2 + site 1 forms an intramolecular bridge between the subdomains 2 ( Gln59 ) and 4 ( Glu207 ) , which keeps the nucleotide - binding cleft closed . The conﬁguration of Mg 2 + site 2 is similar to that found in crystal structures of G - actin with a Mg 2 + coordination to Gln263 and Ser265 of the hydro - phobic loop ( right panel of Figure 3A ) . In the F - actin model , its unique position in the groove of the actin double helix and near Table 1 .

Thr66 of subdomain 2 promotes a contribution to the oblique interaction through the hydrophobic loop ( right panel of Figure 3A ) . Among three putative phosphate ions , two major peaks in the difference map ( Pi - 1 with 5 . 2 s and Pi - 2 with 5 . 9 s ; Figure 3E ) are located near the center of the ﬁlament ( Pi - 1 , (cid:3) 1 A˚ from the ﬁla - ment axis ; Pi - 2 , (cid:3) 3 A˚ ) . The Pi at Pi - site 1 would stabilize the ternary interaction through interacting with Thr202 in the Thr - rich loop , Arg183 of the lateral molecule , and Lys284 of the upper molecule on the minus - end side ( Figure 3C ) . The Pi at Pi site 2 is associated with Arg183 and Arg206 of the same lateral molecule ( Figure3C ) . Thus , Arg183contributestoformtwoPisites . Ofnote , in the G - ATP state , the Arg183 side chain adopts a conformation unsuitableforeitherPisiteformation ( Otterbeinetal . , 2001 ; Rould et al . , 2006 ) ( left panel of Figure 4E ) , which would suggest that polymerization and ATP hydrolysis may be required for the crea - tion of the Pi - binding sites as seen in the F - actin model . A Cavity as a Proposed Phosphate - Release Pathway The phosphate release , as it occurs subsequent to actin polymerization , would be dependent on intrinsic properties of the F - actin . One key feature observed in the EM map is a cylin - drical cavity ( (cid:3) 18 A˚ long , (cid:3) 6 A˚ in diameter ) along the interdo - main groove on the backside of the actin molecule , which was observed in the EM map ( Figures 4A – 4C and Figure S4 ) ﬂanked by two additional actin chains ( blue and purple in Figure 4E ) and the b - phosphate of ADP ( Figures 4B – 4D ; see also Movie S3 ) . The cavity would be the only obvious route by which the hydrolyzed g - phosphate could readily access the external solvent ( Figure 4C and Figure S4 ) . The Pi site 1 , which is located near the exit of the cavity ( Figure 4C ) , could constitute a possible intermediary binding site for the hydrolyzed g - phosphate in a phosphate - release pathway ( Figure 4E ) . His73 , which also ﬂanks the cavity and is methylated in most eukaryotes , putatively changes side - chain conﬁguration after polymerization . In the G - ATP state , the d - nitrogen of His73 forms an interdomain H bond with the carbonyl oxygen of Gly158 , thereby bridging two major domains ( left panel of Figure 4E ) , whereas the H bond is likely to be disrupted in the F - actin . The imidazolic ring and the methyl group of meth - ylated His73 are located near the phenolic ring of Tyr198 of A B C E D Figure 4 .

In F - actin ( colored panel ) , the intermolecular cavity is formed along the groove between the outer and inner domains of the green molecule and is ﬂanked by the subdomain 4 of the purple actin molecule . Because the phosphate - binding site 1 ( Pi1 ) is located near the exit of the cavity , the hydrolyzed phosphate will be bound to this site before it escapes to the external solvent .

The methylated His73 modulates access of the hydrolyzed g - phosphate to the Pi site 1 . Such amechanismwouldexplainreportsofPireleasepriortopolymer - ization when His73 is not methylated and Pi release from Hi - s73Ala - actin showing almost no lag time after polymerization ( Nyman et al . , 2002 ) . Thus , we propose that the hydrolyzed g - phosphate binds to the Pi - binding site 1 ( Pi - site 1 ) and stabilizes the F - actin by reinforcing the ternary interaction before leaving actin ﬁlaments and that the methyl group of methylated His73 helps conﬁne the Pi - release pathway . Downward Bending of the Pro - Rich Loop The EM map shows that the DNase I loop extends along the lateral molecule toward the upper molecule and the middle portion ( h0 , residues 41 – 48 ) of the DNase I loop associated with the Pro - rich loop ( residues 108 – 112 ) of the upper molecule ( right panel of Figure 3A ) . The exact conformation of the h0 segment of the DNase I loop could not be determined , but in our analysis , we have modeled it as a short a helix ( Figure S1F ) , similar to that in the crystal structure of G - ADP actin ( Otter - bein et al . , 2001 ) . A large upward shift of this segment may explain why polymerization is inhibited by phosphorylation of Tyr53 ( Liu et al . , 2006 ) : the phosphate group of phosphorylated Tyr53 could form H bonds with Lys61 and thus restricts the extendability of the DNase I loop ( Baek et al . , 2008 ) . It is most likely that residues in the middle portion of the DNase I loop are close to the Pro - rich loop ; in particular , it forms an inter - action with Leu110 , of which the side - chain density was apparent in the EM map ( Figures 1C ) . The Pro - rich loop , in turn , bends down toward the plus end . The stacking interaction of Pro109 with His161 observed in G - actin , however , is not possible in the F - actin model ( Figures 4D and 4E ) . This is signif - icant , as His161 and Gln137 both have been suggested to be involved in the ATP hydrolysis ( Matsuura et al . , 2000 ; Vorobiev et al . , 2003 ) , and the sensor loop and the Pro - rich loop ( contain - ing Pro109 and Pro112 ) constitute the back - door region , which has been suggested to control phosphate release ( Wriggers and Schulten , 1999 ) . The importance of the Pro - rich loop was conﬁrmed through a focused study of the Pro109 mutants using X - ray crystallog - raphy and ATPase assay ( Figure 5 and Figure S5 ) . Structural changes due to the mutations were observed mainly in the region around the bound nucleotide and h6 , with no outer - domain rota - tion being observed . In the structure of wild - type actin , a water molecule ( Wat1203 ) is H - bonded to the 3 - oxygen of Gln137 , which renders it nucleo - philic . However , a nucleophilic in - line attack on g - phosphate would not occur ( Matsuura et al . , 2000 ; Vorobiev et al . , 2003 ) , as that water is too distant from the g - phosphate ( 4 . 0 A˚ ) . The d - nitrogen of His161 coordinates with another water molecule ( Wat1259 in Figures 5A – 5C ) , which , in turn , forms an H bond with the nucleophilic water and thus constrains its position ( Figure 5A ) . In Pro109Ile - actin , His161 has no partner for stack - ing ( Figure 5B ) , and the imidazolic ring of His161 is rotated by (cid:3) 12 (cid:4) , which disrupts the H bond network between His161 and the nucleophilic water ( Figure 5B ) . As a consequence , the nucle - ophilic water is found closer to the g - phosphate ( 3 . 6 A˚ ) , but ATP hydrolysis does not occur ( Figures 5B and 5E ) , presumably because the back door is still closed , likely due to a hydrophobic interaction of the introduced Ile109 with Val163 and Ile175 . However , in Pro109Ala mutant where His161 still has no partner for stacking , the Pro - rich loop is found bent further downward by 1 . 8 A˚ ( Figure 5C ) , with a shift in the main chain of Ala109 and Leu110 , and no density for g - phosphate is observed . The sensor loop is shifted upward in a manner similar to that in the F - ADP + Pi model or in G - ADP crystals ( Otterbein et al . , 2001 ; Rould et al . , 2006 ) . This indicates that the ATP added to the crystallization specimens is hydrolyzed with subsequent g - phosphate release ( Figure 5C ) . The ATPase activity of the Pro109Ala mutant in the presence of Mg 2 + increased by (cid:3) 10 - fold under nonpolymeriz - able conditions compared to control actin ( 1 / 424 s (cid:1) 1 versus 1 / 4510 s (cid:1) 1 ) , whereas the activity of Pro109Ile actin was increased by (cid:3) 2 - fold ( 1 / 2159 s (cid:1) 1 [ Figure 5E ] ) . Using ethenoATP , the nucleotide exchange rate of Pro109Ala - actin was shown to be 40 times faster ( 1 / 7 s (cid:1) 1 ) than the hydrolysis rate ( Figure 5F ) . Taken together , these data indicate that the downward bending of the Pro - rich loop is the key prerequisite for ATP hydrolysis rather than the outer - domain rotation , which assists the bending of the Pro - rich loop during polymerization ( Figure 6 ) . Mechanism of ATP Hydrolysis Based on X - Ray Crystallography In the catalytic site of the G - actin structures , an extensive network of water molecules can be observed , which is stabilized through interactions with the P loop 1 , the P loop 2 , the sensor Figure 5 .

Two water molecules , Wat1203 and Wat1259 , which change their positions depending on the introduced mutation , could be critical in the function of the ATPase cycle in the presence of Mg 2 + . We propose a four - step mechanism for the ATPase cycle ( see Movie S4 ) . First , by polymerization ( or Pro109Ala mutation ) , the stacking interaction of His161 is lost , and the water - mediated ( Wat1259 ) H bond between the nucleophilic water ( Wat1203 ) and His161 is disrupted , with a back door being half open , allow - ing a shift in the position of the nucleophilic water . Second , the nucleophilic water ( Wat1203 ) moves closer to the g - phosphate . Third , the water attacks the ATP , which then is hydrolyzed to ADP and Pi . Fourth , the sensor loop shifts upward and facilitates the Pi release to the Pi - release cavity by fully opening the back - door . The proposed mechanism is supported by the conserva - tion of key residues for ATPase activation ( Pro109 , Leu110 , His161 , and residues of two P loops [ residues 13 – 16 and 156 – 159 ] ) ( Figure S5B ) . Figure 5D summarizes how ATPase activity correlates with the states of the key water molecules , the back door , and nucleotide . In the presence of Ca 2 + , ATPase activity is low ( Figure 5E ) . The second step of ATPase cycle is slow because the water molecule Wat1108 is coordinated with Ca 2 + ion keeping the nucleophilic water Wat1203 away from the g - phosphate ( 4 . 4 A˚ ) ( see Figure S5A for details ) . This explains , in part , the differences between Ca 2 + - actin and Mg 2 + - actin in their dynamic polymeriza - tion properties ( Carlier et al . , 1986 ) . DISCUSSION Rotational Flexibility of Outer Domain One of the apparent structural changes in actin observed in the F - actin model compared to G - actin is a pronounced rotation of the outer domain in a swing - door manner . Such a rotation was A B Figure 6 . Proposed Model for Actin Polymerization ( A ) Schematicdiagramofactinpolymerization .

Afterthey are incorporated into the ﬁlament , ATP is hydrolyzed , forming an intermediate F - ADP + Pi ( colored in gray ) and then ADP - actin ( colored in dark gray ) .

The phosphate moieties of the bound nucleotides and the hydrolyzed g - phosphates are shown in orange spheres . The subdomain 4 is repre - sented by two cylinders corresponding to helices h5and h6 . In thismodel , polymerizationand ATP hydrolysis proceed infour steps as described inthetext . This model implicates that the actin ﬁlament has at least three actin molecules in an F - ATP state on the plus end ( ATP cap ) and that the activation of ATPase does not occur in a trimer ( a proposed nucleus for elongation ) . 284 Cell 143 , 275 – 287 , October 15 , 2010 ª 2010 Elsevier Inc . reported recently with the outer - domain rotation around the axis perpendicular to the actin helix axis , a propeller - like twisting ( Oda et al . , 2009 ) ( Figure S2A ) . The observed apparent rotation in the F - actin model is , however , different , with the rotation axis oriented by 40 (cid:4) relative to the ﬁlament axis ( Figure 2A ) . This rotation could be described as two perpendicular rotations , roughly propeller - like twisting and scissor - like closing . The apparent difference between the two studies may be due to the torsional and / or bending ﬂexibility of actin ﬁlaments and absence of added Pi in the sample used to obtain the ﬁber diffraction data . Of note , the orientation of the outer domain is variable even among the crystal structures of G - actin ( (cid:3) 10 (cid:4) ) , but this ﬂexibility does not trigger ATP hydrolysis , suggesting that more substantial changes such as these shown in this work are required for ATPase activation to promote the down - ward bending of the Pro - rich loop , a key prerequisite for trig - gering ATPase activity . How Polymerization Triggers ATP Hydrolysis At the heart of the G - actin to F - actin dynamics lies the question how polymerization triggers ATP hydrolysis . We propose a detailed model for polymerization based on the F - actin model , outlined in Figure 6B and Movie S5 . A newly incorporated mole - cule ( # 2 magenta ) enables the outer - domain rotation of the penultimate actin molecule ( # 3 green ) . The other oblique interac - tion between the penultimate actin and the neighboring actin molecule ( # 4 blue ) helps to orient the subdomain 2 of the penul - timate actin so that its DNase I loop ( the cylinder tethered to subdomain 2 in Figure 6B ) reaches out upward . The middle portion of the DNase I loop ﬁts in the rear half of the hydrophobic cleft , where the middle portion associates with the Pro - rich loop of the molecule on the minus - end side ( # 5 in yellowish green ) . This interaction induces the downward shift of Pro - rich loop and triggers ATP hydrolysis . The back door becomes fully open , and Pi is released to the Pi - release pathway ( stage 2 in Figure 6B ) . Thus , the interaction of the DNase I loop with the Pro - rich loop is the key step to couple actin assembly with ATPase activation . These results explain why actin with a nicked DNase I loop polymerizes poorly ( Khaitlina et al . , 1993 ) . Hydrolyzed g - phosphate binds to the Pi site 1 and reinforces the ternary interaction . Phalloidin , which binds to the site ( Lorenz et al . , 1993 ) near the Pi site 1 and slows the Pi release to the external solvent ( Dancker and Hess , 1990 ) , appears to mimic and / or reinforce the function of Pi . Unlike phalloidin , Pi can reversibly dissociate from the sites at low Pi concentrations , resulting in weakened intermolecular interactions . In summary , the EM map and resulting quasi - atomic model of F - ADP + Pi show intricate intermolecular interfaces and binding sites for Pi and Mg 2 + that allow proposal of a molecular mecha - nism of ATP hydrolysis upon actin assembly and delayed Pi release , in which the Pro - rich loop has a central role in coupling polymerization with ATP hydrolysis . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Electron Microscopy and Image Processing Actin was prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle ( Spudich and Watt , 1971 ) . Actin ﬁlaments were prepared in solution containing 50 mM NaCl , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 025 mM ATP , 10 mM sodium phosphate [ pH 7 . 4 ] , 0 . 05 % NaN 3 , and 0 . 7 mM DTT at room temperature ( 25 (cid:4) C ) . Zero energy loss cryo - EM micro - graphs were recorded at 200 kV ( Hitachi EF - 2000 with a cold ﬁeld emission gun and an in - column energy ﬁlter ) with a low - noise , high - sensitivity , and high - resolutionCCDcamera ( YasunagaandWakabayashi , 2008 ) withelectron dose of 15 – 20 e (cid:1) / A˚ 2 , a nominal magniﬁcation of 100 – 110 k , and underfocus values of 1 – 1 . 5 m m . High - coherence beam generated by cold ﬁeld emission gun was useful to minimize the image blurring due to underfocusing . The CCD camera with an epitaxially - grown scintillator ( Yasunaga and Wakabaya - shi , 2008 ) helped collect images with high resolution . All of the images were analyzed with a pixel size of 2 . 28 A˚ with EOS software ( Yasunaga and Waka - bayashi , 1996 ) . Images were segmented to contain 26 actin molecules and classiﬁed into 120 groups with 3 (cid:4) step rotation angles and were treated as single particles ( Narita et al . , 2001 ; Narita and Mae´da , 2007 ) . In the resultant 3D image , noncrystallographic helical symmetry was determined with cross - correlation analysis . Finally , the 14 actin molecules on the minus - end part in the EM map were averaged after ﬁtting each other using SPIDER ( Frank et al . , 1996 ) . The noncrystallographic helical symmetry with a 166 . 48 (cid:4) rotation and a 27 . 3 A ˚ translation along the ﬁlament axis was used . Model Building and Reﬁnement The initial model consisting of 26 G - ADP actin molecules ( Rould et al . , 2006 ) was manually ﬁtted to the EM density using O ( Jones et al . , 1991 ) . The reﬁne - ment was performed using spatially restricted molecular dynamics ( Noda et al . , 2006 ) . EM densities were treated as added pseudo - potential so that atoms tended to be retained in higher - density regions of the EM map . Throughout the reﬁnement , the validity of the atomic model was checked with the real - space R factor with O ( Jones et al . , 1991 ) and the program pdbRhoFit ( Yasunaga and Wakabayashi , 1996 ) , which sums up the density of the EM map where the atoms are located . The degree of ﬁt of the atomic modeltotheEMdensitywasalsoaccessedbycalculatingFOMfromtheFour - ier transforms of the EM map and the atomic model ( Yonekura et al . , 2003 ) . Manual model rebuilding using O ( Jones et al . , 1991 ) and reﬁnement using steered - molecular dynamics were performed iteratively to produce the ﬁnal model . Crystallization and Structural Determination Dictyostelium actin mutants were expressed and puriﬁed , as described previ - ously ( Noguchi et al . , 2007 ) , withslight modiﬁcations . To minimize the effect of polymerizationonbiochemicalassays , E205 , R206 , andE207weremutatedto Ala so that actin becomes nonpolymerizable ( Noguchi et al . , 2007 ) . Crystals of the complex of actin mutant ( P109I / E205A / R206A / E207A ) with gelsolin segment 1 in the Ca 2 + state were obtained by hanging drops containing 13 % PEG3550 , 130 mM LiCl , 100 mM MES [ pH 7 . 0 ] , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 0 . 2mMATP , and0 . 2mMAMP - PNP . ToobtaincrystalsintheMg 2 + state , 10 mM MgCl 2 and 0 . 5 mM EGTA were added before the crystallization . Crystals of the complex of another actin mutant ( P109A / E205A / R206A / E207A ) with gelsolin segment 1 were obtained in a similar manner . Crystals were cryoprotected with glycerol or ethylene glycol and then ﬂash cooled in liquidnitrogen . DatawerecollectedatPhotonFactory ( KEK , Japan ) . Thestruc - tures were solved by molecular replacement ( Storoni et al . , 2004 ) using Dictyostelium wild - type actin ( Matsuura et al . , 2000 ) as an initial model . The models were rebuilt and reﬁned using O ( Jones et al . , 1991 ) and Refmac5 ( Collaborative Computational Project , Number 4 , 1994 ) . Polymerization Assays Each actin mutant ( 2 . 3 m M ) was incubated in 150 mM NaCl , 20 mM imidazole - HCl ( pH 7 . 0 ) , 3 mM MgCl 2 , 10 m M CaCl 2 , and 1 mM ATP for 30 min at 25 (cid:4) C , ultracentrifuged , and analyzed by SDS - PAGE . In Vivo Optical Microscopy In vivo copolymerization of mutant actin with wild - type actin was assayed by quantifying GFP - actin . In brief , Dictyostelium cells expressing GFP - fused wild - type or mutant actin were grown in HL5 . In the mid log phase of growth , the culture medium was replaced with lysis buffer containing 20 mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 50 mM NaCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 , and Cell 143 , 275 – 287 , October 15 , 2010 ª 2010 Elsevier Inc . 285 protease inhibitors . After 1 min , the soluble and insoluble fractions were sepa - rated and subjected to western blotting analysis using anti - GFP antibodies . Assay of ATPase Activity and Nucleotide Exchange Rate The ATPase activity of G - actin was measured as described previously ( Saeki et al . , 1996 ) in 10 . 7 m M actin mutant , 10 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 5 mM DTT , and 0 . 2 mM ATP at 25 (cid:4) C . To measure the activity for the Mg 2 + state , 0 . 2 mM MgCl 2 and 0 . 3 mM EGTA were added before the measurement . E205A / R206A / E207A mutations were added to make the mutant polymeriza - tion incompetent ( Noguchi et al . , 2007 ) and exclude the effect of polymeriza - tiononATPaseactivation . Nucleotideexchangewasmeasuredbyﬂuorometry of the ethenoATP incorporated to G - actin ( 340 nm excitation , 410 nm emission ) . The experiments were performed with 2 m M actin in the presence or absence of 0 . 5 m M Dictyostelium proﬁlin I . The reaction was initiated by diluting the actin solution ( 10 mM Tris - HCl [ pH 7 . 5 ] , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 0 . 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 3 mM EGTA , and 1 m M ATP ) into a buffer containing 20 m M ethenoATP .
