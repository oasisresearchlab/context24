Mycobacterium ulcer - ans infections cause progressive muscle atrophy and dysfunction , and mycolactone impairs satellite cell proliferation . Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol 300 : R724 – R732 , 2011 . First published January 5 , 2010 ; doi : 10 . 1152 / ajpregu . 00393 . 2010 . —Clinical observations from Buruli ulcer ( BU ) patients in West Africa suggest that severe Mycobacterium ulcerans infections can cause skeletal muscle con - tracture and atrophy leading to signiﬁcant impairment in function . In the present study , male mice C57BL / 6 were subcutaneously injected with M . ulcerans in proximity to the right biceps muscle , avoiding direct physical contact between the infectious agent and the skeletal muscle . The histological , morphological , and functional properties of the muscles were assessed at different times after the injection . On day 42 postinjection , the isometric tetanic force and the cross - sectional area of the myoﬁbers were reduced by 31 % and 29 % , respectively , in the proximate - infected muscles relative to the control muscles . The necrotic areas of the proximate - infected muscles had spread to 7 % of the total area by day 42 postinjection . However , the number of central nucleated ﬁbers and myogenic regulatory factors ( MyoD and myoge - nin ) remained stable and low . Furthermore , Pax - 7 expression did not increase signiﬁcantly in mycolactone - injected muscles , indicating that the satellite cell proliferation is abrogated by the toxin . In addition , the ﬁbrotic area increased progressively during the infection . Lastly , muscle - speciﬁc RING ﬁnger protein 1 ( MuRF - 1 ) and atrogin - 1 / muscle atrophy F - box protein ( atrogin - 1 / MAFbx ) , two muscle - speciﬁc E3 ubiquitin li - gases , were upregulated in the presence of M . ulcerans . These ﬁndings conﬁrmed that skeletal muscle is affected in our model of subcutaneous infection with M . ulcerans and that a better understanding of muscle contractures and weakness is essential to develop a therapy to minimize loss of function and promote the autonomy of BU patients . skeletal muscle force ; degeneration ; edema ; ﬁbrosis ; muscle regener - ation BURULI ULCER ( BU ) IS AN INFECTIOUS disease caused by Mycobac - terium ulcerans . BU is currently the third most common myco - bacterial disease in the world , after tuberculosis and leprosy . This neglected infectious disease , which affects mostly the poorest people in developing countries , can cause very severe chronic skin lesions if diagnosis and treatment are delayed . In West Africa , most BU patients experience disabilities resulting from cutaneous ﬁbrosis and soft tissue contracture , which limit the range of motion of the affected joint ( 7 , 25 ) . While skeletal muscles play a key role in joint mobility and are located just under the necrotic skin infected by M . ulcerans , they have received little attention in BU studies . Moreover , clinical investigations of BU patients in West Africa have revealed that over half of the patients suffer from range - of - motion limitations and functional restrictions ( 7 ) . Furthermore , anecdotal and empirical observations suggest that BU patients generally suffer from skeletal muscle necrosis , atro - phy , and contracture . In our mice model of BU , the subcutaneous injection of M . ulcerans has been shown to cause necrosis , chronic inﬂammatory response , ﬁbrosis , and skeletal muscle stiff - ness ( 17 ) . Clinical and experimental ﬁndings , thus , indicate that M . ulcerans infections play a major role in the loss of skeletal muscle integrity . Repair and maintenance of skeletal muscle are attributed to the satellite cells . In response to several stimuli , including muscle injury , quiescent satellite cells activate , proliferate , and differen - tiate to repair damaged skeletal muscle ( 4 ) . Pax - 7 is expressed and transcriptionally active in quiescent satellite cells ( 26 ) . Following activation , satellite cells proliferate and coexpress Pax - 7 and MyoD ( 26 ) . Pax - 7 is also implicated in the regulation of satellite cell self - renewal , and Pax - 7 - null mice present impairment in muscle regeneration combined with a progressive loss in satellite cell number due to cell cycle defect and increased apoptosis ( 19 ) . Muscle mass is maintained by a fragile balance between protein synthesis and degradation , and muscle atrophy can occur when this balance is disturbed . The selective loss of contractile proteins relative to cellular proteins generally results in muscles with smaller myoﬁbers ( 3 ) . Chronic systemic inﬂammation is one of the potential conditions that can lead to signiﬁcant muscle atrophy ( 21 ) . For example , sepsis is characterized by chronic , systemic inﬂammation associated with both a reduction in protein synthesis and a breakdown of muscle proteins , in particular , the contractile proteins actin and myosin ( 12 , 13 ) . The atrophying muscles display increased rates of protein degradation , mainly caused by the activation of the ubiquitin proteasome system ( 2 ) . In addition , the muscle - speciﬁc E3 ubiquitin ligase muscle - speciﬁc RING ﬁnger protein 1 ( MuRF - 1 ) and atrogin - 1 / muscle atrophy F - box proteins ( atrogin - 1 / MAFbx ) are upregulated , while myogenic reg - ulatory factors , such as MyoD and myogenin , are usually down - regulated ( 20 , 35 ) . Since proinﬂammatory cytokines possess a strong potential for mediating sepsis - induced proteolysis of myo - ﬁbrillar proteins in skeletal muscles ( 9 , 12 , 21 ) and since a number of these cytokines are upregulated during M . ulcerans infections ( 17 ) , we veriﬁed the impact of M . ulcerans infections on biceps muscle at the histological , morphological , and functional levels . We demonstrated that the presence of M . ulcerans and mycolac - tone reduces muscle force production , upregulates MuRF - 1 and atrogin - 1 , and impairs satellite cell proliferation , all of which are associated with ﬁbrosis and muscle atrophy and dysfunction . MATERIALS AND METHODS Animal care and feeding . Male C57BL / 6 mice weighing 20 – 22 g ( Charles River Laboratories , Saint - Constant , QC , Canada ) were housed two per cage in pathogen - free conditions .

No differences in food and water consumption or physical activity were observed between groups . Experimental design . A previously developed protocol was used to evaluate the histological , biochemical , and functional impacts of M . ulcerans infections on skeletal muscles ( 17 ) . In the present study , the contractile properties , atrophy , ﬁbrosis , and regeneration of biceps muscles were assessed in 72 mice randomly assigned to three groups : 1 ) no treatment ( control , CTR , n (cid:1) 24 ) , 2 ) subcutaneous injection near the right biceps muscle with 30 (cid:2) l of PBS containing culture media ( Sham , n (cid:1) 24 ) , and 3 ) subcutaneous injection with M . ulcerans suspended in PBS [ 10 5 acid - fast bacilli ( AFB ) / 30 (cid:2) l ] near the right biceps muscle [ proximate - infected biceps ( PIB ) ; n (cid:1) 24 ] . The biceps muscle was chosen because it is a superﬁcial and easy muscle to dissect and it possesses two distinct tendons at its extremities . This superﬁcial muscle allows us to perform subcutaneous injection mim - icking somehow the mode of M . ulcerans infection . All mice from each group were killed on day 7 ( n (cid:1) 6 ) , day 21 ( n (cid:1) 9 ) , and day 42 ( n (cid:1) 9 ) postinjection . The infectious process did not progress exten - sively , and no apparent changes in physical activities were observed in infected mice . M . ulcerans injection protocol and surgical procedure . The injec - tion and surgical procedures were performed as described previously ( 15 ) . Brieﬂy , M . ulcerans strain 957 – 05 isolated from a BU patient in 2005 and identiﬁed by PCR using the insertion sequence IS2404 was grown for 6 – 8 wk on Lowenstein - Jensen medium at 30°C in a reduced oxygen environment ( 5 % CO 2 ) . The mycobacteria were collected and suspended in PBS . A homogeneous aliquot ( 10 (cid:2) l ) was stained using the Ziehl - Neelsen method , and the concentration of AFB was determined by manual counting using a microscope equipped with an immersion objective ( (cid:3) 1000 magniﬁcation ) . The concentra - tion was adjusted to 10 5 AFB / 30 (cid:2) l . The mice were anesthetized using 2 . 5 % isoﬂurane in O 2 at a rate of 600 ml / min . The AFB suspension ( 30 (cid:2) l ) or PBS with medium was injected subcutaneously into the right front limb , avoiding direct contact with the biceps muscle . On days 7 , 21 , and 42 postinjection , the CTR , Sham , and PIB mice were injected with buprenorphine ( 0 . 1 mg / kg ) and anesthetized 15 min later with pentobarbital sodium ( 40 mg / kg ) . An additional dose of pento - barbital sodium was given as needed to maintain profound anesthesia throughout the surgical procedure . The CTR , Sham , and PIB muscles were carefully removed for in vitro contractile , histological , and biochemical analyses . Mice were then euthanized by cervical dislo - cation . Measurements of contractile properties in vitro . To examine mus - cle force and function , each tendon of CTR , Sham , and PIB muscles was attached using 3 – 0 silk sutures . The distal tendon was tied to a rigid support between two platinum electrodes submerged in Krebs - Ringer buffer supplemented with 2 mg / ml of glucose as described previously ( 17 ) . The muscle was aligned vertically , and the proximal tendon was ﬁxed to the arm of a dual - mode servomotor ( 305B - LR , Aurora Scientiﬁc , Aurora , ON , Canada ) controlled by Dynamic Mus - cle Control software . Carbogen ( 95 % O 2 : 5 % CO 2 ) was constantly bubbled through the solution , which was kept at 25°C . Twitch tension and isometric contractions were performed , and twitch peak tension ( Pt , mN ) and maximal tetanic force ( P 0 , mN ; speciﬁc P 0 , N / cm 2 ) values were recorded , and force - frequency curves were generated as described previously ( 14 ) . Assessment of ﬁber area , regeneration , edema , and ﬁbrosis of skeletal muscles . Because the histological and contractile results indicated that there was no difference between Sham and CTR muscles , muscle atrophy , repair , and ﬁbrosis were assessed on CTR and PIB muscles only . Following the evaluation of the functional properties , the CTR and PIB muscles were trimmed of visible fat , tendons , and other connective tissues . The biceps were then weighed and stretched to near resting length , embedded in tissue freezing medium ( Triangle Biomedical Sciences , Durham , NC , USA ) , and frozen in isopentane that was cooled in liquid nitrogen . Muscle tissue sections ( 10 (cid:2) m thick ) were stained with hematoxylin - and - eosin , and images were acquired at (cid:3) 200 magniﬁcation . To measure muscle atrophy , the CSA of 200 randomly selected myoﬁbers per muscle section were determined using ImageJ software . To assess the necro - sis and repairing processes of skeletal muscles , the necrotic area and the number of central nucleated myoﬁbers were determined and expressed per CSA . The necrotic area was estimated in each muscle section by subtracting the summed area of normal and regenerating ﬁbers from the total area of each ﬁeld . ( 18 ) . Other tissue sections from CTR and PIB muscles were stained with Masson’s trichrome to color collagen blue . The surface areas of blue - stained tissues were measured and expressed as percentages of the total CSAs of the muscles . In another set of experiments , CTR , Sham , and PIB muscle samples were weighed and dehydrated for 18 h in a SpeedVac concentrator . Wet and dry muscle masses were subtracted to assess water content and edema . Protein sample preparation and Western blot analysis . CTR , Sham , and PIB muscles were homogenized in 200 (cid:2) l of lysis buffer ( 20 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 140 mM NaCl , 10 (cid:2) M MgCl 2 , 1 (cid:2) M CaCl 2 , 2 (cid:2) M NaF , 8 . 3 (cid:2) M Na 3 VO 4 , 2 (cid:2) M PMSF , 1 ml glycerol , 100 (cid:2) l Igepal , and 10 (cid:2) l of protease inhibitors in a ﬁnal volume of 10 ml ) . The homogenate was centrifuged at 10 , 000 g for 5 min , and the pellet was discarded . The protein content of the homogenates was measured using BCA protein assay kits ( EMD Chemical , Darmstadt , Germany ) . The protein concentrations were compared with a standard curve and determined at 562 nm using a Perkin - Elmer plate reader ( 6 ) . The protein suspensions ( 50 (cid:2) g ) were separated by SDS - PAGE . The proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membrane ( Bio - Rad , Hercules , CA ) and incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies ( atrogin - 1 rabbit polyclonal ; ECM Biosciences , Versailles , KY ) , MuRF - 1 goat polyclonal ( Novus Biological , Littleton , CO ) , MyoD rabbit polyclonal ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) , and myogenin rabbit polyclonal ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) diluted 1 : 1 , 000 in 5 % dry milk . (cid:4) - Tubulin ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) was used as an endogenous reference to monitor protein loading . Protein bands were detected using horseradish peroxidase - linked goat anti - rabbit or bovine anti - goat secondary antibodies . The bands were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection substrate ( Western Lightning Plus ECL ; Perkin Elmer , Waltham , MA ) . The chemiluminescent signal was acquired on Kodak ﬁlm ( X - OMAT ; LS Kodak scientiﬁc imaging ﬁlm ) and relative signal bands were quan - tiﬁed from scans ( TIFF images ) by densitometric analysis of inte - grated gray levels corrected for local background using Quantity One software ( Bio - Rad ) . Pax - 7 expression in injured skeletal muscles . To evaluate myo - genic potential in various conditions , skeletal muscles were injected and chemically damaged with 10 (cid:2) l of PBS ( Sham ) , 70 % ethanol ( Sham ) , mycolactone ( 25 (cid:2) g ) , or bupivacaine ( 50 (cid:2) g ) . Bupivacaine is a very well known myotoxin molecule that produces very reproduc - ible induction of muscle damage and repair . Because bupivacaine destroys myoﬁbers but spares satellite cells , leaving the basal laminae and microcirculation intact , it can be used as a positive control for muscle regeneration and recovery . After 7 days postinjury , control and experimental muscles were then dissected , homogenized , and immunolabeled with Pax - 7 ( Abcam ) on Western blot , as previously described to assess satellite cell survival and proliferation . Statistical analysis . All data are reported as means (cid:5) SE . The data were compared with a one - way ANOVA using JMP software ( JMP 7 ; SAS Institute , Cary , NC ) and Tukey’s a posteriori test . P values (cid:6) 0 . 05 were considered signiﬁcant . RESULTS M . ulcerans causes a signiﬁcant loss of muscle force . To evaluate the functional impact of M . ulcerans on the biceps muscles , twitch tension ( Pt , mN ) and maximal isometric force ( absolute P 0 , mN ) values were recorded in CTR , Sham , and PIB muscles on days 7 , 21 , and 42 postinfection .

The abso - lute P 0 values were 18 % and 31 % lower for the PIB muscles than for the Sham muscles on days 21 and 42 , respectively ( Fig . 1 B ) . The decline in muscle force was time dependent in PIB muscles , and signiﬁcant differences were observed be - tween PIB muscles at 7 , 21 , and 42 days . These decrements were nearly constant since the force - frequency curves for the PIB muscles were signiﬁcantly lower than the Sham and CTR muscles ( Fig . 1 C ) . However , M . ulcerans had no signiﬁcant inﬂuence on speed - related contractile parameters , since the time - to - peak tension ( TPT ; ms ) and half - relaxation time ( RT½ ; ms ) values were not signiﬁcantly different from those of the Fig . 1 .

Although M . ulcerans causes myoﬁber atrophy , edema , and the accumula - tion of connective tissue , which can all change the size of skeletal muscles , we also found a signiﬁcant decrease in muscle - speciﬁc force ( sP 0 , N / cm 2 ) at 21 and 42 days postin - jection relative to sham muscles ( data not shown ) . M . ulcerans and mycolactone cause muscle edema , damage , atrophy , and ﬁbrosis with impairment in satellite cell pro - liferation .

The edema progressed steadily , with the water content of the PIB muscles increasing from 2 . 6 % to 12 % between days 7 and 21 relative to the sham muscles ( Table 1 ) . Interestingly , the edema decreased thereafter , with no signiﬁ - cant differences between the CTR , Sham , and PIB muscles on day 42 . To assess muscle ﬁbrosis , CTR and PIB muscle sections were stained with Masson’s trichrome . As expected , there was more collagen in the PIB muscles than in the CTR muscles ( Figs . 2 , A and B ) . The area of ﬁbrotic tissue increased over time and reached 4 . 5 % and 5 . 3 % of the muscle CSA on days 21 and 42 , respectively ( Fig . 2 C ) . The histological obser - vations with hematoxylin and eosin suggested that the edema was mainly concentrated between muscle fascicles ( Figs . 3 , A and B ) . Furthermore , the M . ulcerans infections caused a signiﬁcant reduction in myoﬁber CSA , with the mean values for the PIB muscles dropping by 17 % and 29 % on days 21 and 42 , respectively , relative to the CTR muscles ( Fig . 3 C ) . The number of central nucleated myoﬁbers was also determined to estimate the number of regenerating ﬁbers . The CTR muscles did not display any ﬁber damage or central nucleated myoﬁbers while the number of regenerating ﬁbers remained stable at (cid:7) 6 – 7 myoﬁbers / mm 2 from days 7 to 42 in infected skeletal muscles ( Fig . 4 A ) . Consistent with this observation , the levels of expression of myogenic regulatory factors MyoD and myo - genin remained relatively low and stable at all experimental time points ( Figs . 4 , B and C ) . Histological observations also showed that muscle injected with 70 % ethanol ( Sham ) had minor inﬂammatory reaction ( Fig . 5 A ) , whereas skeletal muscles injected with PBS ( Sham ) presented no sign of histological damage ( Fig . 5 B ) . The injec - tion of mycolactone ( 25 (cid:2) g ) or bupivacaine ( 50 (cid:2) g ) induced extensive damage with signiﬁcant cell inﬁltration at 7 days postmuscle injury ( Fig . 5 , C and D ) . The extent of damage was particularly important following mycolactone injection ( Fig . 5 C ) . More importantly , the level of expression of transcription factor Pax - 7 , expressed on quiescent and activated satellite cells , increased by more than 12 - fold in bupivacaine - injected muscles but remained similar to Sham in mycolactone - injected muscles at 7 days postinjury ( Fig . 5 E ) . These results clearly indicated for the ﬁrst time that satellite cell proliferation is abrogated in the presence of mycolactone ( Fig . 5 E ) . As ex - pected , the PIB muscles displayed signiﬁcant areas of necrosis on days 21 and 42 compared with day 7 ( Fig . 6 A ) . The area of necrotic tissue increased and reached 7 % of the muscle CSA on day 42 . This catabolic state was associated with an upregula - tion of the muscle - speciﬁc ubiquitin ligases ( E3 ) atrogin - 1 / MAFbx ( muscle atrophy F - box protein ) and MuRF - 1 ( muscle - speciﬁc RING - ﬁnger 1 ) .

DISCUSSION The loss of contractile proteins and normal sarcomeric organization associated with muscle wasting is the hallmark of diverse catabolic conditions , such as muscle disuse , burn in - jury , cancer , renal failure , AIDS , chronic obstructive pulmo - nary disease , space ﬂight , muscular dystrophy , and aging ( 14 , 22 , 30 , 31 , 34 ) . Loss of muscle mass is also commonly seen in animal models and patients with sepsis ( 1 , 17 , 27 ) . This catabolic state of skeletal muscles is mainly driven by polyu - biquitination , which involves a cascade of proteolytic enzymes , such as ubiquitin - activating enzyme , ubiquitin - conjugated en - zyme , and ubiquitin - protein ligase . Ultimately , the loss of muscle mass results in weakness and fatigue that limit ambu - lation and prolong rehabilitation . The present ﬁndings showed that the M . ulcerans infections caused a 31 % and 29 % decrease in the force and CSA of myoﬁbers , respectively , which was associated with an upregu - lation of atrogin - 1 and MuRF - 1 , two muscle - speciﬁc ubiquitin - ligases involved in protein degradation . The ubiquitin - protea - some system is the major pathway responsible for the turnover of muscle protein , in general , and , more speciﬁcally , in sepsis ( 35 ) . For example , atrogin - 1 and MuRF - 1 play an essential role in sepsis - induced muscle wasting . More recent data have Fig . 5 . Histological damage and Pax - 7 expression in injured skeletal muscles . Skeletal muscles injected with 70 % ethanol ( Sham ) had minor inﬂammatory reaction ( A ) whereas skeletal muscles injected with PBS ( Sham ) presented no sign of histological damage ( B ) . The injec - tion of mycolactone ( 25 (cid:2) g ) or bupivacaine ( 50 (cid:2) g ) induced extensive damage with signiﬁcant cell inﬁltra - tion at 7 days postmuscle injury ( C and D ) . The extent of damage was particularly important following mycolac - tone injection ( C ) . However , Pax - 7 expression increased drastically in bupivacaine - injected muscles but remained low in mycolactone - injected muscles ( E ) . The levels of Pax - 7 were expressed relative to control muscles . All values are expressed as means (cid:5) SE ; n (cid:1) 4 . * Signiﬁ - cantly different from mycolactone and Sham groups .

Another major mechanism of sepsis - induced muscle wasting is the activation of the calpain system . Calpain and caspase - 3 appear to play a pivotal role in ubiquitin - proteasome - mediated muscle wasting by promoting myoﬁbrillar proteolysis ( 5 , 29 ) . Both the ubiq - uitin - proteasome and calpain proteolytic pathways have been shown to be partly controlled by proinﬂammatory cytokines ( 9 , 12 , 21 ) , such as TNF - (cid:4) and IL1 (cid:8) , which increase during M . ulcerans infections ( 17 ) . While the assessment of protein synthesis and degradation was not within the scope of the work reported here , other research on muscle atrophy and sepsis suggests that the loss of muscle mass and the reduction in the CSA of myoﬁbers in mice with M . ulcerans infections are likely the result of an upregulation of protein degradation combined with a reduction in protein synthesis . Muscle growth and regeneration are attributed to satellite cells . Our results showed that M . ulcerans and mycolactone have negative impacts on the regeneration process since the number of centronucleated myoﬁbers and the level of myo - genic regulatory factors MyoD and myogenin and Pax - 7 did not increase over time in the PIB muscles . MyoD is one of the earliest markers of myogenic commitment , which is expressed in activated satellite cells ( 23 ) , while myogenin is essential for the development of functional skeletal muscles ( 24 , 27 ) . The lack of a signiﬁcant increase in MyoD and myogenin content suggested that the presence of M . ulcerans prevented muscle regeneration . More importantly , the level of Pax - 7 expression increased by 12 - fold in bupivacaine - injected muscles , while the level of Pax - 7 expression in mycolactone - injected muscle remains stable , indicating that satellite cell proliferation is inhibited at 7 days postinjury . These results are in agreement with previous ﬁndings demonstrating that injecting skeletal muscles with mycolactone totally abrogates muscle regenera - tion ( 16 ) . The fact that the number of regenerating ﬁbers did not signiﬁcantly increase in these skeletal muscles may , thus , be due to an increase in satellite cell apoptosis , satellite cell inactivation , and / or the decreased unavailability of cytokines and growth factors that govern the muscle regeneration pro - cess . Furthermore , mycolactone can diffuse far from the site of infection ( 11 , 15 ) , penetrate membranes of other cell types , induce cytoskeleton rearrangement , and ultimately cause cell death by apoptosis ( 10 , 28 ) . Alternate interpretations for muscle dysfunction are also possible . First , an in vivo study of mice footpad infections demonstrated that M . ulcerans can invade and produce nerve necrosis ( 8 ) . It is , thus , possible that biceps nerves and / or neuromuscular junctions may be partly dysfunctional , leading to progressive muscle atrophy . Second , the accumulation of Fig . 6 . Necrotic area and expression of two ubiquitin ligases . The necrotic area ( A ) was quantiﬁed for CTR and PIB muscles on days 7 , 21 , and 42 postinjection . Expression levels of atrogin - 1 and muscle - speciﬁc RING ﬁnger protein 1 ( MuRF - 1 ) , two ubiquitin li - gases associated with muscle atrophy .

The inadequate chronic inﬂammatory re - sponse may lead to ﬁbrosis caused by persistent irritant or an upregulation of ﬁbrogenic growth factors and cytokines , which together stimulate the synthesis and deposition of extracellular matrix ( 36 ) . Previous observations have shown that muscle regeneration does not occur in the presence of mycolactone and that the collagen content of skeletal muscle increases by 134 % , indicating that mycolactone stimulates ﬁbroblasts , which are a major cell type in skeletal muscles ( 16 ) . These results are consistent with the increase in the ﬁbrotic areas of the PIB muscles observed on days 21 and 42 . Further in vitro and in vivo studies are needed to clarify the molecular mechanisms by which M . ulcerans , and / or mycolactone , and / or recruited leu - kocytes that secrete proinﬂammatory cytokines are involved in muscle atrophy and muscle regeneration impairment . Perspectives and Signiﬁcance BU is a neglected disease . Little research has been con - ducted on the impact of M . ulcerans on skeletal muscles . The present study demonstrated that M . ulcerans infections lead to a progressive and signiﬁcant decrease in tetanic force produc - tion and twitch tension of biceps muscles close to the site of infection . Histological , morphological , and biochemical anal - yses also indicated that M . ulcerans infections and mycolac - tone induce myoﬁber atrophy and ﬁbrosis , and they inhibit satellite cell proliferation . These results conﬁrmed the involve - ment of skeletal muscles at the functional level in our model of subcutaneous infection with M . ulcerans . The subcutaneous injection of the M . ulcerans was chosen because it mimics the mode of contamination of the disease from bug bites to humans . Furthermore , mice injected with M . ulcerans present a discrete nodule at 7 days postinfection . Several mice exhibit sequentially a local edema and skin ulceration at 21 and 42 days postinfection , respectively ( 17 ) . The same chronological manifestation of the disease is found in humans , making this animal model useful and relevant . We trust that the present work will set the stage for an extensive research program on skeletal muscle rehabilitation directed toward a better under - standing of muscle contracture and weakness that often lead to a loss of function , autonomy , and dignity in BU patients ( see the following Web address for details on this disease : http : / / www . who . int / buruli / en ) .
