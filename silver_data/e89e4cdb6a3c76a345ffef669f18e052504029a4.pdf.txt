Interpreting FCI scores : Normalized gain , preinstruction scores , and scientiﬁc reasoning ability Vincent P . Coletta a (cid:1) and Jeffrey A . Phillips Department of Physics , Loyola Marymount University , Los Angeles , California 90045 (cid:1) Received 2 April 2004 ; accepted 9 September 2005 (cid:2) We examined normalized gains and preinstruction scores on the force concept inventory (cid:1) FCI (cid:2) for students in interactive engagement courses in introductory mechanics at four universities and found a signiﬁcant , positive correlation for three of them . We also examined class average FCI scores of 2948 students in 38 interactive engagement classes , 31 of which were from the same four universities and 7 of which came from 3 other schools . We found a signiﬁcant , positive correlation between class average normalized FCI gains and class average preinstruction scores . To probe this correlation , we administered Lawson’s classroom test of scientiﬁc reasoning to 65 students and found a signiﬁcant , positive correlation between these students’ normalized FCI gains and their Lawson test scores . This correlation is even stronger than the correlation between FCI gains and preinstruction FCI scores . Our study demonstrates that differences in student populations are important when comparing normalized gains in different interactive engagement classes . We suggest using the Lawson test along with the FCI to measure the effectiveness of alternative interactive engagement strategies . © 2005 American Association of Physics Teachers .

It is usually given at the beginning and at the end of a course . 2 Students tend to score higher on the test when it is taken the second time , following instruction . Normalized gain G is deﬁned as the change in score divided by the maxi - mum possible increase G = postcore % − prescore % 100 − prescore % (cid:1) 1 (cid:2) In 1998 , Hake 3 published the results of an extensive survey of class average gains for 6542 students in 62 introductory physics courses in high schools , colleges , and universities . Hake showed that the class average data for all courses (cid:3) tra - ditional and interactive engagement (cid:1) IE (cid:2)(cid:4) combined , showed no signiﬁcant correlation between normalized gain and pre - instruction scores . The importance of Hake’s work cannot be overempha - sized . Normalized gain provides a readily accessible , objec - tive measure of learning in introductory mechanics . Research 3 , 4 demonstrates the superiority of IE methods to traditional methods of instruction . However , we will show that the uncritical use of G as a sole measure of relative effectiveness of alternative IE methods across diverse stu - dent populations may not be justiﬁed . For example , the lack of correlation between G and preinstruction scores for Hake’s entire data set does not mean that there is no corre - lation between these quantities . It is possible that such cor - relations exist for subsets of the population considered by Hake or in other populations not included in his data set . One of our purposes is to show that it is important to consider differences in student populations when comparing the normalized gains of different classes . For example , it might be incorrect to conclude that teaching methods used in an IE class with a normalized gain of 0 . 6 are necessarily more effective than those that produce a gain of 0 . 3 in a different class . The backgrounds of the students in the two classes could be a more important factor than the speciﬁc IE methods used in the classes . An independent way to probe the background of a student population is the Lawson Classroom Test of Scientiﬁc Rea - soning . This multiple - choice test includes questions on con - servation , proportional thinking , identiﬁcation of variables , probabilistic thinking , and hypothetico - deductive reasoning . 5 , 6 The test can be used to identify a student’s rea - soning level . Maloney showed that Lawson test score aver - ages vary among different populations of college students . 7 In his study in the calculus and algebra based physics courses for science majors at Creighton University , nearly 2 / 3 of the students were rated as having reached the highest reasoning level , while in the courses that served education and health science majors , barely 1 / 3 of the students had reached this stage . Given these results , we looked for a pos - sible correlation between Lawson test scores and normalized FCI gains . In Sec . II we analyze both individual student and class average FCI data . In Sec . III we discuss correlations between G and scores on the Lawson test (cid:1) see Appendix (cid:2) . Our con - clusions are presented in Sec . IV . II . FCI NORMALIZED GAIN AND PREINSTRUCTION SCORES We analyzed individual normalized gains for students at Loyola Marymount University (cid:1) LMU (cid:2) , Southeastern Louisi - ana University (cid:1) SLU (cid:2) , University of Minnesota (cid:1) UM (cid:2) , and Harvard University (cid:1) HU (cid:2) . These schools employed IE meth - ods in courses with a signiﬁcant lecture component . The size of the student sample and the class size varied widely : 285 students in 11 classes at LMU , 86 students in two classes at SLU , 1648 students in 14 classes at UM , and 670 students in 4 classes at HU . The Harvard classes were taught by Eric Mazur , Michael Aziz , William Paul , and Bob Westervelt , using the method described in Mazur’s book , Peer Instruction . 2 Peer instruc - 1172 1172 Am . J . Phys . 73 (cid:1) 12 (cid:2) , December 2005 http : / / aapt . org / ajp © 2005 American Association of Physics Teachers tion classes consist of lectures that are divided into short segments each of which is followed by conceptual , multiple - choice questions . Students are ﬁrst asked to answer the ques - tion individually and report their answers to the instructor through a computerized classroom response system or ﬂash - cards . When a signiﬁcant portion of the class obtains the wrong answer , students are instructed to discuss their an - swers with their partners and , if the answers differ , to try to convince the partners of their answer . After this discussion , students report their revised answers , usually resulting in many more correct answers and much greater conﬁdence in those answers . The class average values of G at HU are unusually high , typically about 0 . 6 . Peer instruction was also used by Kandiah Manivannan at SLU . The UM classes were taught by various instructors using the same general approach , called “cooperative group prob - lem solving . ” 8 , 9 The majority of the class time is spent by the lecturer giving demonstrations and modeling problem solv - ing before a large number of students . Some peer - guided practice , which involves students’ active participation in con - cept development , is accomplished using small groups of students . In the recitation and laboratory sections , students work in cooperative groups , with the teaching assistant serv - ing as coach . The students are assigned speciﬁc roles (cid:1) man - ager , skeptic , and recorder (cid:2) within the groups to maximize their participation . The courses utilize context - rich problems that are designed to promote expert - like reasoning , rather than the superﬁcial understanding often sufﬁcient to solve textbook exercises . Of the 285 LMU students , 134 were taught by one of us (cid:1) Coletta (cid:2) , using a method in which each chapter is covered ﬁrst in a “concepts” class . These classes are taught in a So - cratic style very similar to peer instruction . The material is then covered again in a “problems” class . The other author (cid:1) Phillips (cid:2) taught 70 students in lectures , interspersed with small group activities , using conceptual worksheets , short experiments , and context - rich problems . The other LMU professors , John Bulman and Jeff Sanny , both lecture with a strong conceptual component and frequent class dialogue . The value of each student’s normalized gain G was plotted versus the student’s preinstruction score (cid:3) see Figs . 1 (cid:1) a (cid:2) , 2 (cid:1) a (cid:2) , 3 (cid:1) a (cid:2) , and 4 (cid:1) a (cid:2)(cid:4) . Three of the four universities showed a sig - niﬁcant , positive correlation between preinstruction FCI scores and normalized gains . Harvard was the exception . There are , of course , many factors affecting an individu - al’s value of G , and so there is a broad range of values of G for any particular prescore . The effect of prescore on G can be seen more clearly by binning the data , averaging values of G over students with nearly the same preinstruction scores . Binning makes it apparent that very low prescores (cid:1) (cid:1) 15 % (cid:2) and very high prescores (cid:1) (cid:2) 80 % (cid:2) produce values of G that do not ﬁt the line that describes the data for prescores be - tween 15 % and 80 % . For each university , we created graphs based on individual data , using all pretest scores ; individual data , using only prescores from 15 % to 80 % ; binned data , using all pretest scores ; and binned data , using only pres - cores from 15 % to 80 % . Table I gives the correlation coef - ﬁcients , signiﬁcance level , and the slopes of the best linear ﬁts to these graphs . Figures 1 (cid:1) b (cid:2) , 2 (cid:1) b (cid:2) , 3 (cid:1) b (cid:2) , and 4 (cid:1) b (cid:2) show the binned data with prescores from 15 % to 80 % ; the corre - lation effects are seen most clearly in these graphs . The usual measure of statistical signiﬁcance is p (cid:3) 0 . 05 . For LMU and UM , the correlations are highly signiﬁcant (cid:1) p (cid:1) 0 . 0001 (cid:2) : the probability that G and prescore are not correlated in these populations is (cid:1) 0 . 0001 . In Sec . III we discuss a possible explanation for the lack of correlation in the Harvard data . We chose bins with approximately the same number of students in each bin . Ideally , we want the bins to contain as many students as possible to produce a more meaningful average . However , we also want as many bins as possible . We chose the number of bins to be roughly equal to the square root of the total number of students in the sample , so that the number of bins and the number of students in each bin are roughly equal . Varying the bin size had little effect on the slope of the ﬁt . Class average preinstruction scores and normalized gains were also collected for seven classes at three other schools where peer instruction is used : Centenary College , the Uni - versity of Kentucky , and Youngstown State University . These data and class average data for the 31 classes from the other four universities are shown in Fig . 5 . The correlation coefﬁ - cient is 0 . 63 and p (cid:1) 0 . 0001 . The linear ﬁt gives a slope of 0 . 0049 , close to the slopes in Figs . 1 and 2 and corresponds to G = 0 . 34 at a preinstruction score of 25 % and a G = 0 . 56 at a preinstruction score of 70 % . We also examined data from Ref . 3 . For Hake’s entire data set , which includes high school and traditional college classes , as well as IE college and university classes , the cor - relation coefﬁcient was only 0 . 02 , indicating no correlation .

Phillips When we analyzed separately the 38 IE college and univer - sity classes in his study , we found some correlation , although not enough to show signiﬁcance (cid:1) r = 0 . 25 , p = 0 . 1 (cid:2) ; the slope of the linear ﬁt was 0 . 0032 . We then combined Hake’s col - lege and university data with the data we collected . Hake’s data provided only 35 additional classes , because 3 HU classes in Hake’s data set were also contained in our data set . For the entire set of 73 IE colleges and universities , we found a slope of the linear ﬁt close to what we had found for our collected data alone (cid:1) 0 . 0045 (cid:2) . The coefﬁcient was 0 . 39 , signiﬁcant for this size data set (cid:1) p = 0 . 0006 (cid:2) . III . FCI AND SCIENTIFIC REASONING ABILITY Recently , Meltzer published the results of a correlation study 10 for introductory electricity and magnetism . He used normalized gain on a standardized exam , the conceptual sur - vey of electricity (cid:1) CSE (cid:2) , to measure the improvement in con - ceptual understanding of electricity . He found that individual students’ normalized gains on CSE were not correlated with their CSE preinstruction scores . Meltzer did ﬁnd a signiﬁcant correlation between normalized gain on the CSE and scores on math skills tests 11 for three out of four groups , with r = 0 . 30 , 0 . 38 , and 0 . 46 . Meltzer also reviewed other studies that have shown some correlation between math skills and success in physics . Meltzer concluded that the correlation shown by his data is probably not due to a causal relation between math skills and normalized gain and that students’ level of performance on the math test and their normalized gains on the CSE may both be functions of one or more “hidden variables . ” He mentioned several candidates for such variables : general intelligence , reasoning ability , and study habits . We have come to similar conclusions regarding the correlation between G and the preinstruction score we found in our data set . Piaget’s model of cognitive development may provide some insight into differences among students in introductory physics . According to Piaget , a student progresses through discrete stages , eventually developing the skills to perform scientiﬁc reasoning . 12 When individuals reach the penulti - mate stage , known as concrete operational , they can classify objects and understand conservation , but are not yet able to form hypotheses or understand abstract concepts . 13 In the ﬁnal stage , known as formal operational , an individual can think abstractly . Only at this point is an individual able to control and isolate variables or search for relations such as proportions . 14 Piaget believed that this stage is typically reached between the ages of 11 and 15 . Contrary to Piaget’s theoretical notion that most teenagers reach the abstract thinking stage , educational researchers Fig . 2 .

J . Phys . , Vol . 73 , No . 12 , December 2005 V . P . Coletta and J . A . Phillips have shown that many high school students , as well as col - lege students , have not reached the formal operational stage . 15 , 16 Arons and Karplus claimed that only 1 / 3 of col - lege students have reached the formal reasoning stage , 17 and that the majority of students either remain conﬁned to con - crete thinking or are only capable of partial formal reason - ing , often described as transitional . In other studies focusing on physics students , including the work of Maloney , similar results have been seen . 7 , 18 – 20 Formal reasoning skills are nec - essary for the study of physics . For example , students who lack the ability to understand abstract concepts will struggle with Newton’s second law . 21 , 22 In 2003 we began to administer Lawson’s Classroom Test of Scientiﬁc Reasoning as well as the FCI to LMU students to probe the relation between scientiﬁc reasoning ability and normalized gain on the FCI . Of the 285 LMU students tested with the FCI , 65 also took the Lawson test . We found a highly signiﬁcant , positive correlation between students’ nor - malized FCI gains and their Lawson test scores (cid:1) see Fig . 6 (cid:2) . With the slope of the linear ﬁt of 0 . 0069 , and r = 0 . 51 (cid:1) p (cid:1) 0 . 0001 (cid:2) , this correlation is stronger than the correlation between FCI gains and preinstruction FCI scores either for these students alone (cid:1) slope = 0 . 0034 , r = 0 . 26 (cid:2) or in any of the other samples . Figure 7 shows the average value of G for each quartile in Lawson test scores . The 16 students with the highest Lawson scores (cid:1) the top quartile (cid:2) had an average Lawson score of 93 % and an average G of 0 . 59±0 . 07 (cid:1) stan - dard error (cid:2) , while the 16 students with the lowest Lawson scores (cid:1) the bottom quartile (cid:2) averaged 48 % on the Lawson test , with an average G of 0 . 26±0 . 04 . To compare the correlation between Lawson test scores and G with the correlation between FCI prescores and G , we divided the 65 student sample into two groups , those with FCI prescores (cid:3) 33 % (cid:1) N = 33 (cid:2) and those with FCI prescores (cid:2) 33 % (cid:1) N = 32 (cid:2) . We then divided each of these groups into two parts based on their Lawson test scores . Thus we ob - tained four groups : (cid:1) 1 (cid:2) 16 students with low FCI scores (cid:1) 23 % average (cid:2) and Lawson test scores (cid:1) 60 % (cid:1) 48 % average (cid:2) ; (cid:1) 2 (cid:2) 17 students with low FCI scores (cid:1) 21 % average (cid:2) and Lawson test scores (cid:4) 60 % (cid:1) 76 % average (cid:2) ; (cid:1) 3 (cid:2) 15 students with high FCI scores (cid:1) 45 % average (cid:2) and Lawson test scores (cid:1) 80 % Fig . 4 .

Phillips (cid:1) 69 % average (cid:2) ; and (cid:1) 4 (cid:2) 17 students with high FCI scores (cid:1) 58 % average (cid:2) and Lawson test scores (cid:4) 80 % (cid:1) 91 % aver - age (cid:2) . The results in Table II indicate a stronger relation be - tween G and Lawson test scores than between G and FCI prescores . For example , we see that , even though group 3 has a much greater average FCI prescore than group 2 , group 3 has a lower average G (cid:1) 0 . 30 versus 0 . 44 (cid:2) , consistent with the lower average Lawson test score (cid:1) 69 % versus 76 % (cid:2) . As a ﬁnal test that is relevant to our discussion of the Harvard data in Sec . IV , we examined data from the 16 stu - dents who scored highest on the Lawson test , the top quar - tile . In comparing FCI prescores and Lawson test scores for these students , we found no correlation (cid:1) r = 0 . 005 (cid:2) . There was also no signiﬁcant correlation between G and FCI pres - cores (cid:1) r = 0 . 1 (cid:2) . Our study indicates that Lawson test scores are highly cor - related with FCI gains for LMU students . This correlation may indicate that variations in average reasoning ability in different student populations are a cause of some of the variations in the class average normalized gains that we ob - serve . In other words , we believe that scientiﬁc reasoning ability is a “hidden variable” affecting gains , as conjectured by Meltzer . 10 IV . CONCLUSIONS Based on the data analyzed in this study , we conclude the following . (cid:1) 1 (cid:2) There is a strong , positive correlation between individual students’ normalized FCI gains and their prein - struction FCI scores in three out of four of the populations tested . (cid:1) 2 (cid:2) There is a strong , positive correlation between class average normalized FCI gain and class average FCI preinstruction scores for the 38 lecture style interactive en - gagement classes for which we collected data , and nearly as strong a correlation between G and prescore when Hake’s data from his 1998 study are included . (cid:1) 3 (cid:2) A sample of 65 students showed a very strong positive correlation between individual students’ normalized FCI gain and their scores on Lawson’s classroom test of scientiﬁc reasoning . The correla - tion between G and FCI prescores among these students is far less signiﬁcant than the correlation between G and Law - son test scores . Why does the Harvard data show no correlation between G and FCI prescores , while the other three schools show signiﬁcant correlations ? And why are there variations in the slopes ? For LMU and SLU the slopes are 0 . 0062 and 0 . 0063 , respectively , whereas the UM slope is 0 . 0037 , and the class average slope is 0 . 0049 . A possible answer to both questions is that these differences are caused by variations in the com - positions of these populations with regard to scientiﬁc rea - soning ability . We expect that a much higher fraction of Har - vard students are formal operational thinkers and would score very high on Lawson’s test . We found that among the top LMU Lawson test quartile , there is no correlation be - tween FCI prescores and Lawson test scores , and no corre - lation between G and FCI prescores . It is reasonable to as - sume that a great majority of the Harvard student population tested would also show very high scientiﬁc reasoning ability and no correlation between scientiﬁc reasoning ability and FCI prescore ; 75 % of all Harvard students score 700 or higher on the math SAT , and math SAT scores have been shown to correlate with formal operational reasoning . 23 , 24 In contrast , less than 10 % of LMU’s science and engineering students have math SAT scores (cid:4) 700 . If scientiﬁc reasoning ability is a hidden variable that inﬂuences FCI gains , we would expect to see no correlation between G and FCI pres - core for very high reasoning ability populations . Why should there be any correlation between G and FCI prescores for other populations in which a signiﬁcant number of students are not formal operational thinkers ? When stu - dents score low on FCI as a pretest in college , there are many possible reasons , including the inability to grasp what they were taught in high school due to limited scientiﬁc reasoning ability and lack of exposure to the material in high school . Those students whose lack of scientiﬁc reasoning ability lim - ited their learning in high school are quite likely to have limited success in their college physics course as well . But those students who did not learn these concepts in high Fig . 7 . Comparison of average G and average Lawson Test scores for quar - tiles of Lawson scores . Fig . 6 .

Phillips school for some other reason , but who do have strong scien - tiﬁc reasoning ability , are more likely to score high gains in an interactive engagement college or university physics class . We believe it is the presence of those students with limited scientiﬁc reasoning ability , present in varying propor - tions in different college populations , that is primarily re - sponsible for the correlation between G and prescore that we have observed . What , if anything , can be done about poor scientiﬁc rea - soning ability ? One indication that remedial help is possible is the work of Karplus . He devised instructional methods for improving proportional reasoning skills of high school stu - dents who had not learned these skills through traditional instruction . He demonstrated strong improvement , both short - term and long - term , with a great majority of those students . 25 We hope to soon have all incoming students in the College of Science and Engineering at LMU take the Lawson test , so that we can identify students who are at risk for learning difﬁculties in physics and other sciences , and we have begun to develop instructional materials to help these students . We hope that other physics instructors will begin to use the Lawson test in their classrooms . It would be especially meaningful if physics education researchers report interac - tive engagement methods that produce relatively high nor - malized FCI gains in populations that do not have very high Lawson test scores . It is ironic that much of the improved average gains seen in interactive engagement classes is likely due to greatly im - proved individual gains for the best of our students , the most formal operational thinkers . This leaves much work to be done with students who have not reached this stage .
