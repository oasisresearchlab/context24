Unruh 1  , Jeffrey J . Lange 1 , Michaella Levy 1  , Brian D . Slaughter 1 , and Jennifer L . Gerton 1 , 3  The kinetochore is a large molecular machine that attaches chromosomes to microtubules and facilitates chromosome segregation . The kinetochore includes submodules that associate with the centromeric DNA and submodules that attach to microtubules . Additional copies of several submodules of the kinetochore are added during anaphase , including the microtubule binding module Ndc80 . While the factors governing plasticity are not known , they could include regulation based on microtubule – kinetochore interactions . We report that Fin1 localizes to the microtubule - proximal edge of the kinetochore cluster during anaphase based on single - particle averaging of super - resolution images . Fin1 is required for the assembly of normal levels of Dam1 and Ndc80 submodules . Levels of Ndc80 further depend on the Dam1 microtubule binding complex . Our results suggest the stoichiometry of outer kinetochore submodules is strongly influenced by factors at the kinetochore – microtubule interface such as Fin1 and Dam1 , and phosphorylation by cyclin - dependent kinase . Outer kinetochore stoichiometry is remarkably plastic and responsive to microtubule - proximal regulation . Introduction The kinetochore is a large evolutionarily conserved protein structure that is built hierarchically , from the centromeric Cse4 / CENP - A nucleosome to the spindle attachments . The assembly of many of the inner components , often referred to as the consti - tutive centromere associated network , is necessary for the as - sembly of many of the outer components ( De Wulf et al . , 2003 ) . The outer microtubule binding components include the Dam1 subcomplex in budding yeast , composed of 10 subunits ( Li et al . , 2002 ) , which can encircle microtubules in vitro ( Miranda et al . , 2005 ; Westermann et al . , 2005 ) and in vivo ( Ng et al . , 2018 Preprint ) . The microtubule - binding Ndc80 subcomplex is an - chored into the kinetochore by the Mis12 or MIND complex ( Dimitrova et al . , 2016 ) , both of which are evolutionarily con - served from yeast to humans . The Ndc80 complex is composed of four subunits , which form an extended coiled - coil configu - ration and contact the microtubule with finger - like projections ( Westermann et al . , 2003 ; Wei et al . , 2005 , 2007 ) . Together these submodules , along with many additional proteins , make up the structure that attaches centromeres to microtubules for chromosome segregation ( Musacchio and Desai , 2017 ) . Elegant structural studies have elucidated many of the physical inter - actions and substructures that can be assembled in vitro with purified recombinant components . What these reconstitution experiments cannot reveal are the dynamics and heterogeneity that may exist in vivo . In budding yeast , a single microtubule attaches to each chromosome for segregation at mitosis ( Winey et al . , 1995 ) , making it a simple system in which to study kinetochores in vivo . Furthermore , all kinetochores cluster together to create a sub - diffraction limited spot that enables fluorescence microscopy measurements . Recent evidence based on FRAP , photoactivation , and fluorescence microscopy measurements relative to GFP suggests that the conformation of the living kinetochore in budding yeast is both plastic and cell cycle regulated , with extra copies of several submodules added in anaphase , with similar observation in fission yeast , arguing for evolutionary conservation ( Dhatchinamoorthy et al . , 2017 ) . This result conflicts with previous data , and the finding is con - troversial and depends on the choice of reference protein ( Joglekar et al . , 2006 ) . Heterogeneity in the architecture of vertebrate kinetochores has been observed and may depend on the state of microtubule attachment ( Wynne and Funabiki , 2016 ) . The mammalian Ska subcomplex is progressively loaded at congressing kinetochores to improve load - bearing . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1 Stowers Institute for Medical Research , Kansas City , MO ; 2 Open University , Milton Keynes , England , UK ; 3 Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology , University of Kansas Medical Center , Kansas City , KS .

The two main microtubule binding components of the kine - tochore in budding yeast , the Ndc80 and Dam1 submodules , display distinct behavior in anaphase . Imaging - based measure - ments suggest the Ndc80 subcomplex is present in ∼ 8 copies per kinetochore in metaphase , increasing to ∼ 12 in anaphase ( Dhatchinamoorthy et al . , 2017 ) , with the exact number subject to debate ( Joglekar et al . , 2006 , 2008 , 2009 ; Haase et al . , 2013 ) . In contrast , imaging of the Dam1 subcomplex suggests it is present on kinetochores at similar levels throughout the cell cycle , with no detectable turnover ( Dhatchinamoorthy et al . , 2017 ) . Consis - tent with the idea of a hierarchy in building the structure , sub - modules with strong interactions in biochemical and structural data , such as COMA , MIND , and Ndc80 , display stoichiometric increases in concert during anaphase ( Dhatchinamoorthy et al . , 2017 ) . The extra microtubule contacts afforded by the addition of Ndc80 submodules during anaphase may facilitate tracking along the rapidly depolymerizing microtubule . The stoichiome - try of the Ndc80 submodule , but not the Dam1 submodule , was influenced by the depolymerization of microtubules , with slower depolymerization correlating with fewer copies of the Ndc80 submodule added in anaphase . The microtubule – kinetochore interface is a prime location for integrating signals to regulate kinetochore structure and function ( Monda and Cheeseman , 2018 ) . Notably , mutations affecting tension sensing and cytoki - nesis were examined for their impact on kinetochore stoichi - ometry and were found to have no effect ( Dhatchinamoorthy et al . , 2017 ) . However , given the plasticity of kinetochore stoi - chiometry observed in vivo , regulators of the stoichiometry likely exist . In this work we identify factors that influence outer kine - tochore stoichiometry , including Fin1 ( Filaments in between nuclei ) and the Dam1 submodule . Fin1 was originally reported to be a spindle pole body ( SPB ) – related intermediate filament protein ( van Hemert et al . , 2002 ) . Later , Fin1 was shown to purify with the outer kinetochore ( Akiyoshi et al . , 2009 ) . Fin1 has microtubule binding activity ( Woodbury and Morgan , 2007a ) and stabilizes spindles ( Woodbury and Morgan , 2007b ) . Using single - particle averaging ( SPA ) structured illu - mination microscopy ( SIM ) , we find evidence that kineto - chores are radially arranged on the spindle and demonstrate that Fin1 localizes to the SPB proximal side of kinetochore clusters . Fin1 is required for the addition of Ndc80 submodules during anaphase . Additionally , the amount of Ndc80 added in anaphase depends on another microtubule binding sub - complex , Dam1 . Taken together , our data indicate that the outer kinetochore stoichiometry depends on and is responsive to cues from the microtubule – kinetochore interface . Results and discussion Fin1 : A cell cycle – specific kinetochore component To discover factors that enabled the addition of extra kineto - chore submodules during anaphase , we purified kinetochores from cells arrested in G1 with α factor and cdc15 - 1 arrested an - aphase cells using Dsn1 - FLAG ( Akiyoshi et al . , 2009 ) and compared the protein composition by mass spectrometry . Mi - totic exit network mutants , including cdc15 - 1 , tem1 - 1 , and cdc5 - 1 , arrest with high levels of Ndc80 component Nuf2 - GFP at a maximal interkinetochore distance ( Fig . S1 ) , suggesting that cells arrest in late anaphase with a kinetochore stoichiometry typical of late anaphase . There were only three proteins present specifically in the kinetochore purifications from anaphase ( and not G1 ) ; of these three proteins , Fin1 was present at > 10 - fold higher levels than the other two , making it an exceptional candidate ( Fig . 1 a and Table S1 ) . Fin1 was recovered in previous kinetochore purifications , dependent on inner kinetochore pro - tein Ndc10 ( Akiyoshi et al . , 2009 ) . Fluorescence imaging of Fin1 - GFP – tagged protein over the cell cycle was consistent with localization to kinetochores from metaphase to telophase ( Fig . 1 , b and c ) , mass spectrometry data ( Akiyoshi et al . , 2009 ) , and other previous work ( van Hemert et al . , 2002 ) . To understand how the behavior of Fin1 compared with other kinetochore proteins in terms of dynamics during metaphase and anaphase , we used FRAP . Photobleaching during metaphase reveals that Fin1 can recover during anaphase ( Fig . 1 , d and e ) , suggesting it can load during this time window , similar to the behavior of subunits of the Mis12 / MIND and Ndc80 complexes , but contrasting with subunits of the Dam1 complex , which do not recover in FRAP experiments ( Dhatchinamoorthy et al . , 2017 ) . Calibrated imaging enables the calculation of the num - ber of GFP molecules in a subdiffraction limited kinetochore cluster based on the fluorescence of GFP , as determined by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy in live cells ( Shivaraju et al . , 2012 ) . Calibrated imaging is distinct from methods that have been previously used to calculate the stoichiometry of the yeast kinetochore that rely on a GFP - tagged reference protein , which may itself change with the cell cycle . Calibrated imaging of Fin1 - GFP demonstrates an increase from approximately one to four per kinetochore as clusters separate , a significant gain ( Fig . 1 f ) . Ndc80 subunits also increase in this time window , adding approximately four copies ( Dhatchinamoorthy et al . , 2017 ) . Taken together , these experiments put Fin1 near kineto - chores during the time window when kinetochores add copies of particular submodules and suggest the possibility that Fin1 could act as a licensing factor for this addition . Fin1 could also be considered a component of the kinetochore during this time window given its purification with outer kinetochore compo - nents ( Akiyoshi et al . , 2009 ) . SPA - SIM reveals Fin1 is proximal to the SPB Conventional fluorescence microscopy cannot resolve whether Fin1 colocalizes with the SPB or the kinetochore cluster . Therefore , superresolution images of GFP - tagged kinetochore proteins were collected in metaphase and anaphase to help re - solve the location of Fin1 relative to kinetochore components and the SPB . SPA - SIM ( Burns et al . , 2015 ) yields a nanometer scale resolution map of GFP - tagged proteins relative to each other in the kinetochore cluster ( Fig . 2 ) . Spc42 was used as a reference for the location of the SPB , and Tub1 was used to indicate the position of the spindle microtubules . Previous experiments used point fluorescence microscopy and statistical probability maps to deduce the mean position between various proteins in the Dhatchinamoorthy et al .

In these maps , the outer kinetochore components are proximal to the SPB marker with Cse4 , along with other inner kinetochore components , located more distal . The distances we calculated based on SPA - SIM measurements ( Fig . 2 , d and e ) are consistent with these previous reports . For example , the Dam1 and Ndc80 components are SPB - proximal , while the MIND subunit Nnf1 is more distal . Furthermore , we corroborate the finding that the cluster is more elongated in metaphase but becomes compacted during anaphase ( Joglekar et al . , 2009 ) . Figure 2 .

Journal of Cell Biology 4 Outer kinetochore plasticity https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1083 / jcb . 201810070 Microtubules in mitotic spindles are organized as a cylinder ( Winey et al . , 1995 ) . The organization of centromeres on the spindle in mitosis in budding yeast has been modeled , with co - hesin present as a 350 - nm barrel surrounding the spindle mi - crotubules ( Yeh et al . , 2008 ) . Our SPA - SIM analysis nicely revealed a bi - lobed intensity for subunits of Ndc80 , and other components during metaphase . Using simulation of the data , we found that the observed distributions of these proteins , based on the parameters of our superresolution microscope , were con - sistent with radial location of the Ndc80 submodule in meta - phase in a cylinder of ∼ 260 nm ( Fig . S2 ) . These results are consistent with previous models that predict the kinetochore cluster would be a barrel inside the cohesin barrel , providing experimental evidence to support the cylindrical configuration of kinetochores on the mitotic spindle in vivo . During metaphase , Fin1 is located between the SPB and the outer components of the kinetochore . During anaphase , Fin1 more clearly colocalizes with the microtubule - binding compo - nents of the kinetochore Ndc80 and Dam1 . We conclude that Fin1 is located at the outermost edge of the kinetochore cluster , at a position that would enable it to influence the outer kine - tochore during metaphase and anaphase . Fin1 is required for normal stoichiometry of outer kinetochore submodules To examine kinetochore make - up in the absence of Fin1 , we created strains without FIN1 and GFP tags on a subunit of either the MIND , Ndc80 , or Dam1 complex , as an indicator of the status of the subcomplex . We found that the normalized intensity and addition of the MIND complex was unaffected by loss of Fin1 ( Fig . 3 a ) . The normalized intensity of Ndc80 in G1 was similarly unaffected by loss of Fin1 , but the addition of Ndc80 during anaphase was strongly impaired ( Fig . 3 , b and c ) , demonstrating Fin1 is necessary for this addition . Although Dam1 does not add copies during anaphase , the overall normalized fluorescence intensity was affected by loss of Fin1 , with lower levels present in G1 and anaphase ( Fig . 3 c ) , suggesting that the assembly of Dam1 may also depend to some extent on Fin1 . To further define the function of Fin1 for the addition of Ndc80 , we used FRAP ( Fig . 3 , d and e ) . We previously demon - strated that when subunits of the MIND or Ndc80 complex are photobleached during metaphase , they recover during anaphase , indicating that molecules of MIND and Ndc80 complexes are added to the kinetochore cluster as anaphase progresses , a result further confirmed using photoactivation ( Dhatchinamoorthy et al . , 2017 ) . For 16 photobleached cells , the average recovery was > 50 % . However , the same photobleaching experiments in the fin1 Δ background reveal a dramatically and significantly reduced recovery of fluorescence during anaphase , indicating that Fin1 facilitates the recovery ( Fig . 3 d ) . As expected , the Dam1 complex does not recover in anaphase following photobleaching in meta - phase , with or without FIN1 ( Fig . 3 e ) . To further address how loss of Fin1 impacts kinetochores , we performed SPA - SIM for a subunit of the Ndc80 and Dam1 sub - complexes in a fin1 Δ background , using Spc42 - mCherry as a fiducial marker . SPA - SIM data collected for Nuf2 - GFP and Ask1 - GFP in the fin1 Δ background shows that the overall organization of the kinetochore cluster is not dramatically altered ( Fig . 3 f ) . In metaphase , the size of the Nuf2 cluster along the spindle axis is 468 . 2 nm ( SEM , 3 . 9 nm ) in the WT background . In the mutant background , the Nuf2 cluster is 447 . 7 nm ( SEM , 2 . 1 nm ) . In an - aphase , the Nuf2 cluster in the WT background is 194 . 0 nm ( SEM , 1 . 7 nm ) , while the cluster in the mutant background is 255 . 6 nm ( SEM , 2 . 6 nm ) . The Ask1 cluster in the WT background is 467 . 9 nm ( SEM , 5 . 1 ) in metaphase , and in the mutant background , it is 440 . 1 nm ( SEM , 3 . 5 ) . In anaphase , the Ask1 cluster in the WT background is 187 . 2 nm ( SEM , 5 . 0 ) and in the mutant back - ground , it is 259 . 8 nm ( SEM , 4 . 5 ) . In both phases , the WT data appear slightly more clustered , though in metaphase this only appears to condense the substructures and not change the overall shape of the distribution . Although there are differences in the fin1 Δ background compared with WT , the changes are all smaller that the difference between metaphase and anaphase , which we can effectively quantify . Furthermore , by filtering out a small subset of spots that are not diffraction - limited , we ensure that the technique is not compromised . Therefore , none of these differ - ences are expected to compromise our ability to use fluorescence intensity measurements to quantify stoichiometric changes . Taken together , our findings are consistent with Fin1 acting as a recruitment or licensing factor for the addition of Ndc80 in anaphase . In addition to MIND , Cnn1 / CENP - T provides a critical contact for Ndc80 in the kinetochore ( Schleiffer et al . , 2012 ; Malvezzi et al . , 2013 ) , but the recruitment of additional Ndc80 in anaphase surprisingly did not require Cnn1 ( Dhatchinamoorthy et al . , 2017 ) . Recent work reveals that the Cnn1 / CENP - T inter - actions only become essential for assembly of kinetochores in vitro when the MIND pathway of recruitment is crippled ( Lang et al . , 2018 ) . While Cnn1 may have the capacity to anchor extra Ndc80 into the kinetochore , loss of Cnn1 did not worsen the phenotype of the fin1 Δ strain ( Fig . 3 , a – c ) . Importantly , the Ndc80 - anchoring MIND complex is unaffected by loss of Fin1 , arguing that the addition of Ndc80 in anaphase may not be automatically templated by the addition of MIND subunits , even though MIND may provide a critical anchoring interaction . In other words , the presence of the MIND complex is not sufficient for the assembly of the Ndc80 complex . The loss of Fin1 also impacts the stoichiometry of the Dam1 complex . Altogether , our results suggest the stoichiometry of the outer kinetochore may depend on Fin1 - dependent spindle proximal cues . Interplay of Dam1 and Ndc80 on the stoichiometry of the outer kinetochore Dam1 and Ndc80 submodules both interact with micro - tubules , but also interact with each other ( Shang et al . , 2003 ; Lampert et al . , 2010 , 2013 ; Tien et al . , 2010 ; Kim et al . , 2017 ; Jenni and Harrison , 2018 ) . A temperature - sensitive mutation in Dam1 impairs the addition of Ndc80 in anaphase , but the mutation also compromised the assembly of the Dam1 com - plex ( Dhatchinamoorthy et al . , 2017 ) . Ask1 is a subunit of the Dam1 submodule . In a strain with two mutations in Cdc28 / CDK phosphorylation sites in Ask1 ( Higuchi and Uhlmann , 2005 ) , Dam1 assembly is not compromised based on a normal level of fluorescence ( Fig . 4 ) . Under these conditions , the Ndc80 complex is present at lower - than - normal levels in G1 , and there Dhatchinamoorthy et al . Journal of Cell Biology 5 Outer kinetochore plasticity https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1083 / jcb . 201810070 is no increase during anaphase , suggesting that compromising phosphorylation of the Dam1 submodule can cripple recruitment or stabilization of the Ndc80 complex . The MIND complex , however , increases in anaphase relative to G1 , although not to the same degree as in the WT background , but its recruitment in anaphase is not as compromised as the Ndc80 complex by the Dam1 phosphomutation . These findings highlight the interde - pendence of the two microtubule - binding submodules on each other in the kinetochore clusters in living cells . These findings also emphasize some independence between the recruitment of the MIND complex and the Ndc80 complex , akin to the ob - servations in the fin1 Δ background . The recruitment of Ndc80 may not be solely templated by the MIND complex . The impact of Fin1 phosphomutants on the stoichiometry of the outer kinetochore The kinetochore assembly state is regulated by phosphorylation of various subunits in many different species , suggesting phosphorylation acts as an evolutionarily conserved regula - tory mechanism of this molecular machine ( Gascoigne and Cheeseman , 2013 ; Wynne and Funabiki , 2015 ; Dimitrova et al . , 2016 ) . Fin1 phosphorylation is dependent on Clb5 - Cdc28 upon synthesis in S / G2 phase , and Fin1 interacts with the Glc7p cat - alytic subunit of the protein phosphatase type 1 ( PP1 ) complex when in the phosphorylated state ( Mayordomo and Sanz , 2002 ; Loog and Morgan , 2005 ) . However , Fin1 is dephosphorylated by Bmh1 and Bmh2 at mitosis and no longer interacts with Glc7 . To Figure 3 . Assembly of microtubule binding subcomplexesDam1and Ndc80 is affected by loss of Fin1 . ( a ) The MIND submodule compo - nent Dsn1 is not significantly affected by dele - tion of FIN1 or FIN1 and CNN1 . The normalized intensity of GFP - tagged Dsn1 protein was quantified in G1 and anaphase cells from an asynchronous culture . For the box plots in a – c , 200 – 250 kinetochore clusters were quantified , and for statistical analysis , a two - tailed t test was used . The middle line represents the mean , the box represents SD , and whiskers represent SEM . ( b ) The addition of the Ndc80 submodule component Nuf2 in anaphase is significantly re - duced by deletion of FIN1 or FIN1 and CNN1 , while the G1 level is unchanged . The normalized intensity of GFP - tagged Nuf2 protein was quantified in G1 and anaphase cells from an asynchronous culture ( * , P < 0 . 0001 ) . ( c ) The level of Dam1 submodule component Ask1 does not change between G1 and anaphase in WT cells . However , lower levels overall are ob - served when FIN1 or FIN1 and CNN1 are deleted ( * , P < 0 . 0001 ) . ( d ) The percent recovery of Nuf2 - GFP in fin1 Δ ( n = 26 cells ) shows signifi - cantly less recovery than in WT ( n = 16 cells ) . For statistical analysis , a two - tailed t test was per - formed . In the plot , the middle line represents the mean , and whiskers represent SD ; * , P , < 0 . 0001 .

Journal of Cell Biology 6 Outer kinetochore plasticity https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1083 / jcb . 201810070 further address whether Fin1 is acting in concert with Glc7 to regulate the make - up of the kinetochore , we analyzed the be - havior of Nuf2 - GFP in a glc7 - 10 temperature - sensitive mutant background . Nuf2 showed normal addition to kinetochores dur - ing anaphase ( Fig . S3 ) . Therefore , Glc7 function is not necessary for the kinetochore transition in anaphase . We also note that Glc7 was not present in our kinetochore purifications . Therefore , the effect of Fin1 at kinetochores may be independent of Glc7 . Fin1 is a phosphoprotein with 5 phosphorylation sites for cyclin - dependent kinase and a PP1 binding motif . To determine how phosphoregulation of Fin1 impacts kinetochore stoichiom - etry , we used point mutations in Fin1 . Fin1 - 5A will block phos - phorylation by Cdc28 / CDK , whereas Fin1 - AA bears a mutation in the PP1 binding motif ( Bokros et al . , 2016 ) . We first examined the localization of these mutant proteins . We found that the localization of the 5A mutant protein in anaphase was indis - tinguishable from Fin1 ( Fig . 5 a ) . However , when the mutant protein contained the AA mutation , it showed additional local - ization along the spindle , suggesting that interaction with PP1 normally prevents this localization . We next examined whether Ndc80 was added in anaphase in Fin1 phosphodeficient mutant backgrounds . Strains with these mutations as the sole source of Fin1 all grew normally under the conditions examined ( Fig . 5 b ) . We found that Nuf2 - GFP increased in anaphase relative to G1 in all the mutant backgrounds , but addition was most compro - mised in the Fin1 - 5A background ( Fig . 5 c ) . The spindle Figure 4 . An Ask1 phosphomutant curtails the addition of Ndc80 in anaphase . ( a ) Normalized fluorescence intensity measurements indicate that a strain bearing the ask1 - 2A mu - tation does not compromise the assembly of the Dam1 sub - complex .

Error bars indicate SEM ; * , P , < 0 . 0001 . ( e ) Normalized fluorescence intensity measurements indicate that a strain bearing the ask1 - 2A mutation has addition of MIND subcomplex component Dsn1 - GFP in anaphase ( * , P < 0 . 0001 ) . ( f ) The ratio of fluorescence in anaphase / G1 shows that Dsn1 - GFP increases in intensity in the ask1 - 2A strain background . Error bars indicate SEM ; * , P < 0 . 0001 .

Journal of Cell Biology 7 Outer kinetochore plasticity https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1083 / jcb . 201810070 localization of the Fin1 - AA mutant did not extend to Nuf2 - GFP in the AA mutant background . These data suggest phosphoryl - ation of Fin1 may normally enhance the stoichiometry transition that depends on Fin1 . Given that we observed the most signifi - cant decrease in the 5A mutant background , we next asked how Dam1 and MIND subunits were impacted by the 5A mutation . We found that the mutation also mildly reduced MIND addition ( Fig . 5 d ) but did not impact Dam1 ( Fig . 5 e ) . Altogether these results suggest that interaction of Fin1 with PP1 impacts spindle localization , whereas the phosphorylation of Fin1 by Cdc28 is required for maximal addition of Ndc80 and MIND sub - complexes in anaphase . Deletion of Fin1 is more deleterious to the assembly of the Dam1 subcomplex than the phosphomutant , which has no discernable impact . Elegant structural studies with purified proteins have re - vealed important principles of individual kinetochore organi - zation , assembly , and structure . However , these studies do not reveal the dynamics , plasticity , and spindle arrangement in live cells . We provide experimental evidence that kinetochores are present in a radial arrangement on the metaphase spindle . The Figure 5 . Impact of Fin1 phosphomutants on kine - tochore stoichiometry .

Journal of Cell Biology 8 Outer kinetochore plasticity https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1083 / jcb . 201810070 stoichiometry of the outer kinetochore is plastic and responsive to spindle - proximal factors , providing a possible explanation for why these proteins are variably recovered in kinetochore pu - rification procedures from yeast extracts . Fin1 , positioned at the outer edge of the kinetochore cluster from metaphase to telo - phase , is required to achieve the normal assembly of both Ndc80 and Dam1 . The assembly of the MIND complex is not sufficient for normal assembly of the outer kinetochore in vivo , as dem - onstrated in Fin1 and Dam1 mutant backgrounds . The amount of Ndc80 assembled further depends on Dam1 and Fin1 phos - phoregulation by cyclin - dependent kinase . While the assembly of the kinetochore is certainly hierarchical , multifactorial cues integrated at the microtubule interface can further influence the assembly status of the outer components and reveal the potential for plasticity in kinetochore stoichiometry . Materials and methods Strains used in this manuscript are listed in Table S2 . For sta - tistical analysis , data distribution was judged to be normal based on visual inspection , but this was not formally tested . Kinetochore purification and mass spectrometry Kinetochores were purified as described ( Akiyoshi et al . , 2009 ) . To purify kinetochores from cells arrested in G1 , 8 liters of culture was arrested with α - factor ( 5 µM ) . To purify kineto - chores from cells arrested in anaphase , 5 liters of yeast culture was collected after shifting the culture to 37°C for 3 h . Cell pellets were frozen in liquid N 2 and lysed using the Retsch mixer mill mm400 for three cycles ( 3 min on / 5 min off in liquid N 2 ) . Lysate in H0 . 15 ( 25 mM Hepes , pH 8 . 0 , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 1 mM EDTA , pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 5 mM EGTA , pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 1 % NP - 40 , 150 mM KCl , 15 % glycerol with 2 mM DTT , protease , and phosphatase inhibitors ) was ultra - centrifuged to collect the clear top layer , which was used for affinity - purification after incubating with antibody – conjugated Dyna - beads for 3 h . Kinetochores were eluted with 0 . 5 mg / ml 3XFlag peptide before Multidimensional Protein Identification Technology ( MudPIT ) . TCA - precipitated protein samples Dsn1 - His - Flag or no - tag controls isolated from three biological replicates from G1 - phase or anaphase cells ( 12 total immunoprecipitated samples ) were analyzed independently by MudPIT , as described previously ( Washburn et al . , 2001 ; Florens and Washburn , 2006 ) . Briefly , samples were urea denatured , reduced , and alkylated before digestion with recombinant LysC ( Promega ) and modified trypsin ( Promega ) . Reactions were quenched by the addition of formic acid to a final concentration of 5 % . After digestion , pep - tide mixtures were pressure - loaded onto 100 - µm fused silica microcapillary columns packed first with 9 cm of reverse - phase material ( Aqua ; Phenomenex ) , followed by 3 cm of 5 - µm Strong Cation Exchange material ( Luna ; Phenomenex ) , followed by 1 cm of 5 - µm C 18 reverse - phase . The loaded microcapillary columns were placed in - line with a 1260 Quartenary HPLC ( Agilent ) . The application of a 2 . 5 - kV distal voltage electrosprayed the eluting peptides directly into Orbitrap - Velos Pro or Elite hybrid mass spectrometers ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) equipped with a custom - made nano - liquid chromatography electrospray ionization source . Full mass spectrometry spectra were recorded on the eluting peptides over a 400 – 1 , 600 mass - to - charge range in the Orbi - trap at 60 , 000 resolution , followed by fragmentation in the ion trap ( at 35 % collision energy ) on the first to fifteenth most intense ions selected from the full MS spectrum . Dynamic ex - clusion was enabled for 90 s ( Zhang et al . , 2009 ) . Mass spec - trometer scan functions and HPLC solvent gradients were controlled by the XCalibur data system ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . RAW files were extracted into . ms2 file format ( McDonald et al . , 2004 ) using RawDistiller v . 1 . 0 , in house – developed soft - ware ( Zhang et al . , 2011 ) . RawDistiller D ( g , 6 ) settings were used to abstract MS1 scan profiles by Gaussian fitting and to imple - ment dynamic offline lock mass using six background poly - dimethylcyclosiloxane ions as internal calibrants ( Zhang et al . , 2011 ) . MS / MS spectra were first searched using ProLuCID ( Xu et al . , 2015 ) with a peptide mass tolerance of 6 ppm and 500 ppm for fragment ions . Trypsin specificity was imposed on both ends of candidate peptides during the search against a protein data - base containing 5 , 843 yeast proteins ( National Center for Bio - technology Information , February 26 , 2013 , release ) , as well as 193 usual contaminants such as human keratins , IgGs , and proteolytic enzymes . To estimate false discovery rates , each protein sequence was randomized ( keeping the same amino acid composition and length ) , and the resulting “ shuffled ” sequences were added to the database , for a total search space of 12 , 038 amino acid sequences . Masses of 57 . 0215 D were differentially added to cysteine residues to account for alkylation by carbox - yamidomethylcysteine and 15 . 9949 D were differentially added to methionine residues . DTASelect v . 1 . 9 ( Tabb et al . , 2002 ) was used to select and sort peptide / spectrum matches ( PSMs ) passing the following criteria set : PSMs were only retained if they had a DeltCn of ≥ 0 . 08 ; minimum XCorr values of 1 . 8 for singly , 2 . 1 for doubly , and 2 . 5 for triply charged spectra ; peptides had to be at least seven amino acids long . Results from each sample were merged and compared using CONTRAST ( Tabb et al . , 2002 ) . Combining all three runs from G1 or anaphase samples , proteins had to be detected by at least two peptides and / or two spectral counts . Proteins that were subsets of others were removed using the parsimony option in DTASelect on the proteins detected after merging all runs . Proteins that were identified by the same set of peptides ( including at least one peptide unique to such protein group to distinguish between isoforms ) were grouped together , and one accession number was arbitrarily considered as repre - sentative of each protein group . NSAF7 ( Zhang et al . , 2010 ) was used to create the final reports on all detected peptides and nonredundant proteins identified across the different runs . Spectral and protein level false dis - covery rates were , on average , 0 . 1 ± 0 . 09 % and 2 . 4 ± 1 . 0 % , re - spectively . NSAF7 was also used to generate a list of all PSMs leading to the identification of proteins in either or both of the G1 and anaphase samples . FRAP For FRAP and cell cycle time series experiments , an Ultraview VoX spinning - disk system ( PerkinElmer ) with a CSU - 10 spinning disk ( Yokogawa Electric Corp . ) on a 200M inverted microscope Dhatchinamoorthy et al . Journal of Cell Biology 9 Outer kinetochore plasticity https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1083 / jcb . 201810070 base ( Zeiss ) was used . Images were collected with a 100× 1 . 46 NA α - Plan Apochromat oil objective onto an electron - multiplying charge - coupled device camera ( C9100 - 13 ; Hamamatsu Photon - ics ) using Volocity software ( PerkinElmer ) . GFP and mCherry were excited with the 488 - nm and 561 - nm laser lines , respec - tively , using a 405 / 488 / 561 / 640 dichroic . The emission filter for green was a 500 – 550 - nm Bandpass , and for red it was a 415 – 475 - nm / 580 – 650 - nm dual Bandpass filter . For FRAP , asynchronous or arrested cells from mid - log phase were washed with synthetic complete medium and sandwiched between a slide and a cover - slip in a 2 % agar pad made with complete medium . Metaphase cells were chosen based on a sister kinetochore clusters distance ( < 0 . 1 µm ) or SPB distance ( < 0 . 2 µm ) . After collecting the pre - bleach image , GFP was bleached with four iterations of 100 % 488 - nm laser . The bleached cell was followed through the next G1 , and the intensity of the GFP was quantified . The intensity of the ki - netochore cluster was normalized to the prebleach intensity . For cell cycle time series experiments , the slide was prepared as described for FRAP , and images were acquired in long in - tervals to minimize photobleaching . For temperature - sensitive mutants , G1 - arrested cells were released from the arrest and were placed on a preheated 37°C microscopy chamber for image acquisition . Similar FRAP settings were used . For quantification , ImageJ was used , and percent recovery was calculated as in Dhatchinamoorthy et al . ( 2017 ) . Calibrated imaging ( counting molecules ) Calibrated imaging to obtain the Fin1 - GFP copy number was performed essentially as in Dhatchinamoorthy et al . ( 2017 ) and Shivaraju et al . ( 2012 ) with a few modifications . Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and confocal imaging were performed on the LSM 780 microscope using a 40× 1 . 2 NA C - Apochromat objective . Detection was accomplished through a 488 / 561 di - chroic and a 1 – airy unit pinhole with the Quasar GaAsP spectral photomultiplier tube in photon - counting mode detecting be - tween 500 and 561 nm . Images were acquired from an asyn - chronous live culture , and intensities were quantitatively compared with a cytosolic GFP strain whose concentration was determined via fluorescence correlation spectroscopy . Where necessary , the laser power was decreased to image Fin1 - GFP , and images were multiplied by the power ratio to obtain appropri - ately scaled images for quantitation . Linearity of the microscope laser power was verified before imaging . Image processing for calibrated imaging was performed in an identical fashion to Shivaraju et al . ( 2012 ) . Briefly , the Fin1 - GFP spots were fit to Gaussian functions and filtered based on size to eliminate declustered spots . Spot amplitudes were then com - pared with those predicted for a single GFP molecule from the fluorescence correlation spectroscopy measurements . Quantitative imaging ( relative molecule density ) Quantitative imaging was performed similarly to the FRAP imaging ( described above ) with the same objective and optical path . Control and mutant samples were collected on the same day using identical settings to allow for quantitative compari - son of intensity . Asynchronous live cultures were imaged with 300 - nm z resolution along with transmitted light to allow for cell cycle determination . G1 cells were selected by finding clearly unbudded cells with round morphology . Anaphase cells were selected as large budded cells with kinetochores contacting ei - ther cell membrane . The maximum intensity slice for each ki - netochore was fit to a Gaussian function , and kinetochores with an SD < 245 nm ( 1 . 75 pixels ) were included in the analysis . At this size cutoff , there is not a significant bias in the size of the G1 and anaphase kinetochore sizes for WT or mutant samples . There - fore , we are confident that reported intensity changes reflect increased protein density and not changes in kinetochore clus - tering . All reported intensities are Gaussian amplitudes in camera intensity units divided by 1 , 000 or 10 , 000 to put them in the 0 – 10 range . Anaphase / G1 ratios were calculated from the average intensities , and errors were propagated from the stan - dard error measurements according to Bevington ( 2003 ) . Structured illumination imaging Structured illumination imaging was performed using an Ap - plied Precision OMX Blaze microscope ( GE Healthcare ) with three PCO Edge sCMOS cameras for image detection . The ob - jective was an Olympus 60× 1 . 42 NA Plan Apochromat N . GFP and mCherry were excited with 488 and 561 nm excitation , re - spectively , and light was collected through standard GFP and mCherry emission filters . Reconstruction was accomplished using the SoftWoRX software ( GE Healthcare ) following stan - dard protocols and a Weiner filter setting of 0 . 001 . After re - construction , color alignment was performed using the color alignment slide and protocol provided by GE Healthcare . SMA analysis SPA - SIM was performed similar to Burns et al . ( 2015 ) with cus - tom tools in ImageJ ( National Institutes of Health ) with a few exceptions . Briefly , image alignment was performed with either Spc42 - mCherry or Fin1 - GFP as the fiducial marker for image alignment . Mother and daughter spots were identified by hand in sum projections of SIM images and then fit to two 3D Gaussian functions to identify alignment axes . Images were then realigned along this axis so that the centers of the fiducial markers were in the x and z axis center of the realigned image , and the midpoint between the fiducial markers was in the y axis center of the re - aligned image . The image was then divided into mother and daughter images with the fiducial centered along the y axis of the resulting image . The daughter image was flipped so that all images were oriented with fiducial markers in the center and the spindle pointing toward the bottom of the image . Early experiments did not resolve significant differences between the morphology of mother and daughter kinetochore components , so these two sets of images were averaged together in the final reconstructions . To create SPA images , the image sets were filtered for spindle length ( as described in the main text ) and then maximum pro - jected over five z slices centered on the fiducial signal . The images were then averaged and scaled eightfold with bilinear interpolation for display . Because we do not expect left - right asymmetry for any of the structures investigated here , images were averaged with their mirror images to improve signal . For assessment of cluster positions , average vertical profiles were generated from the SPA - SIM images and fit to single Dhatchinamoorthy et al . Journal of Cell Biology 10 Outer kinetochore plasticity https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1083 / jcb . 201810070 Gaussian functions to estimate their centers . Despite individual image alignment , the averaged images displayed slight shifts between either Fin1 or Spc42 signals . Distances were therefore measured relative to the fiducial and corrected to the Spc42 distance with the data from Fin1 - GFP and Spc42 - mCherry . These distances were also used to perform fine image alignment before contour generation . Contours were generated by scaling the images another eightfold with bilinear interpolation ( for a total of 32 - fold scaling over the raw data ) and then thresholding at 75 % of the maximum intensity in each image . An outline was then generated from this thresholded spot and added to a vector map in Adobe Illustrator . Gaussian and multi - Gaussian fitting were performed via nonlinear least squares with error values estimated via fitting of 100 Monte Carlo simulations with random noise corresponding to the distribution of fit residuals ( Bevington , 2003 ) . All custom plugins for this procedure are available at http : / / research . stowers . org / imagejplugins with source code available at https : / / github . com / jayunruh . Simulations of kinetochore cylinders To simulate SPA - SIM imaging of a cylindrical structure , we first determined the dimensions of the microscope focal volume . We chose to use the dimensions of Spc42 from our SPA - SIM re - constructions along the direction of the spindle as determined by Gaussian fitting . The lateral dimension was determined to be 119 nm , and the axial dimension was determined to be 272 nm ( full width half maximum values ) . These values are close to the theoretical values for mCherry imaged with a structured illu - mination microscope . Next , 3D images with 5 nm isotropic resolution were generated with four circles oriented along the z dimension of an image . Circles were spaced 75 nm apart along the y dimension and had a diameter of 250 nm . This image was then convolved with a 3D Gaussian function corresponding to the focal volume dimensions determined above . Finally , a single 3D Gaussian was placed on the image to approximately repre - sent the Fin1 - GFP signal .
