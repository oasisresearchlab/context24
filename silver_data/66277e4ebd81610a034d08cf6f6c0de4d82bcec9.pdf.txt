Social contact studies help measure the effectiveness of NPIs and estimate parameters for modelling SARS - CoV - 2 transmission . However , few contact studies have been conducted in Africa . Methods : We analysed nationally representative cross - sectional survey data from 19 African Union Member States , collected by the Partnership for Evidence - based Responses to COVID - 19 ( PERC ) via telephone interviews at two time points ( August 2020 and February 2021 ) . Adult respondents reported contacts made in the previous day by age group , demographic characteristics , and their attitudes towards COVID - 19 . We described mean and median contacts across these characteristics and related contacts to Google Mobility reports and the Oxford Government Response Stringency Index for each country at the two time points . Results : Mean reported contacts varied across countries with the lowest reported in Ethiopia ( 9 , SD = 16 , median = 4 , IQR = 8 ) in August 2020 and the highest in Sudan ( 50 , SD = 53 , median = 33 , IQR = 40 ) in February 2021 . Contacts of people aged 18 – 55 represented 50 % of total contacts , with most contacts in household and work or study settings for both surveys . Mean contacts increased for Ethiopia , Ghana , Liberia , Nigeria , Sudan , and Uganda and decreased for Cameroon , the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) , and Tunisia between the two time points . Men had more con - tacts than women and contacts were consistent across urban or rural settings ( except in Cameroon and Kenya , where urban respondents had more contacts than rural ones , and in Senegal and Zambia , where the opposite was the case ) . There were no strong and consistent variations in the number of mean or median contacts by education level , self - reported health , perceived self - reported risk of infection , vaccine acceptance , mask ownership , and perceived risk of COVID - 19 to health . Mean contacts were correlated with Google mobility ( coefficient 0 . 57 , p = 0 . 051 and coefficient 0 . 28 , p = 0 . 291 in August 2020 and February 2021 , respectively ) and Stringency Index ( coefficient − 0 . 12 , p = 0 . 304 and coefficient − 0 . 33 , p = 0 . 005 in August 2020 and February 2021 , respectively ) . Conclusions : These are the first COVID - 19 social contact data collected for 16 of the 19 countries surveyed . We find a high reported number of daily contacts in all countries and substantial variations in mean contacts across countries and by gender . Increased stringency and decreased mobility were associated with a reduction in the number of con - tacts . These data may be useful to understand transmission patterns , model infection transmission , and for pandemic planning . © The Author ( s ) 2022 .

BMC Medicine ( 2022 ) 20 : 344 Background Over 352 million cases and 5 . 6 million deaths from coro - navirus disease ( COVID - 19 ) have been recorded world - wide as of January 24 , 2022 [ 1 ] . With the first case on the African continent reported in Egypt on February 14 , 2020 [ 2 ] , Africa accounts for 3 . 4 and 4 . 2 % of meas - ured COVID - 19 cases and deaths , respectively [ 3 ] . While some countries have reported more infections than others , with South Africa , Morocco , Tunisia , Ethiopia , Egypt , Libya , Kenya and Zambia accounting for nearly 70 % of all COVID - 19 cases in Africa by January 24 , 2022 [ 3 ] , the relatively low burden of COVID - 19 in Africa compared to Europe and North America has been , in part , attributed to demographic factors such as younger and more rurally located populations , differences in case and death detection capacity , and environmental factors such as higher temperatures [ 4 – 6 ] , as well as countries’ previous experience with outbreak prone diseases [ 7 ] . In the absence of effective pharmaceutical interventions early in the pandemic , non - pharmaceutical interven - tions ( NPIs ) , or public health and social measures , were adopted to limit transmission and person - to - person con - tacts . African countries’ success in containing and delay - ing the first wave of SARS - CoV - 2 infections was partially attributed to the prompt and early introduction of NPIs . However , the timing and intensity of those measures var - ied between countries . By March 16 , 2020 , when the total reported cases had reached 64 , South Africa declared a national disaster , banned travel from the worst - affected countries and public gatherings , and closed schools . By March 26 , 2020 , when cases neared 927 and deaths were zero , the government announced a three - week national lockdown [ 8 ] . Closure of educational institutions and travel restrictions were also implemented in Kenya , fol - lowed by a partial lockdown on April 6 , 2020 , with 158 cases and 6 deaths [ 8 ] . In the second half of March 2020 , a 48 - h lockdown was also announced in DRC’s second largest city following the identification of two cases , whereas Senegal imposed a dusk - to - dawn curfew from March 24 , 2020 , with 79 cases and zero reported deaths [ 9 ] . In contrast , Ethiopia did not introduce lockdown measures but relied on an extensive testing and screening programme combined with public awareness campaigns [ 10 ] . Given the current challenge of ensuring sustained access to vaccines , many African countries continue to rely on NPIs , which can be economically burdensome , unsustainable , or challenging for people to adhere to . The effectiveness of many control measures can be assessed through social contact studies , which estimate the num - ber and type of person - to - person contacts . These contact estimates are also important components of mathemati - cal models of respiratory infectious disease dynamics [ 11 ] . Few contact studies have been conducted in Africa , which means that models must rely on estimates from so - called synthetic matrices , which adjust high - income country contact patterns with population and household structures in low - and middle - income countries ( LMICs ) [ 12 ] . Exceptions to this since the start of the pandemic are a study in informal settlements in Kenya [ 13 ] , one in KwaZulu - Natal in South Africa [ 14 ] , and one in dif - ferent settings in Ethiopia [ 15 ] . However , these are not nationally representative . This is also the case for other pre - COVID - 19 contact studies—in rural coastal Kilifi in Kenya [ 16 , 17 ] , rural Uganda [ 18 ] , rural Senegal [ 19 ] , in Cape Town and in a rural community and urban area in South Africa [ 20 , 21 ] , and in a rural and a peri - urban site of Manicaland in Zimbabwe [ 22 ] . We used cross - sectional data collected by the Partner - ship for Evidence - based Responses to COVID - 19 ( PERC ) and described and quantified social contacts from nation - ally representative samples of Africa Union Member States gathered from August 4 to 17 , 2020 and February 8 to 25 , 2021 . We compared mean and median contacts by different demographic characteristics and COVID - 19 perceptions . We related contact patterns to the inten - sity of restrictions during the survey periods using the Oxford Government Response Stringency Index as well as Google Community Mobility Reports . We further con - sidered how well these indicators capture changes in con - tacts . This paper provides one of the first comprehensive measurements of person - to - person contact behaviour across Africa during the COVID - 19 pandemic . Methods Survey methodology Telephone interviews were conducted with adult respondents ( aged 18 and over ) with access to a lan - dline or a mobile phone in 18 countries ( Cameroon , Democratic Republic of Congo , Egypt , Ethiopia , Ghana , Guinea , Ivory Coast , Kenya , Liberia , Mozambique , Nige - ria , Senegal , South Africa , Sudan , Tunisia , Uganda , Zam - bia , and Zimbabwe ) during August 4 to 17 , 2020 ( survey 1 , S1 ) and these countries plus Morocco during February 2 to 28 , 2021 ( survey 2 , S2 ) . The survey was designed as a quota sample survey through Random Digit Dial ( RDD ) with quotas on gender and urban / rural location within each country to achieve a sample closely matching the Keywords : COVID - 19 , SARS - CoV - 2 , Social contacts , Physical distancing , Modelling Page 3 of 13 Dobreva et al . BMC Medicine ( 2022 ) 20 : 344 profile of each country . Multiple call - backs to unan - swered numbers dialled was not part of the design [ 23 ] . Respondents were first asked questions relating to their knowledge about COVID - 19 , their risk percep - tions of catching COVID - 19 , their general health , and the potential impact of SARS - CoV - 2 on their heath ( Addi - tional file 1 ) . They were subsequently asked about their attitude towards the existing control measures , their confidence in the government’s response , their attitude towards vaccination ( in survey 2 only ) and the burden of the pandemic on them and their household . Respond - ents were finally asked whether they had been diag - nosed or believed to have had COVID - 19 , about their socio - demographic characteristics , and the number of contacts they had had in the last 24 h with contactees ( people who respondents had a contact with ) aged 0 – 17 , 18 – 55 , or over 55 . A contact was defined as “anyone with whom [ the respondent ] exchanged at least a few words and was close enough to not need to raise [ their ] voice or [ who they ] had direct physical contact with ( including handshaking or other contact ) . ” Contacts were catego - rised according to contacts with members of the house - hold ; with external visitors to the household ; with people at work , school , or university ; or with people in other places . Demographic data such as the respondent’s self - reported age , residence , household size , monthly income , and educational level were also collected . Statistical analysis R version 4 . 1 . 1 and Stata version 16 . 1 were used for the cleaning and preparation of the survey datasets and the subsequent analysis [ 24 , 25 ] . Data analysis was performed at the level of individual countries due to the anticipated variability between countries and given the novelty of such country - level analysis . Respondents’ gender , age , residence area , household head education level , monthly income and household size were characterised ( Table 1 and Additional file 2 : Table S1 for surveys 1 and 2 , respectively ) . Survey 2 had not collected monthly income in a common currency , preventing comparisons across countries . The age struc - ture of the sampled populations was also compared to United Nations’ World Population Prospects ( WPP ) data on the number of people by age group ( Additional file 2 : Table S2 ) and the percentage of female and rural popula - tion according to World Bank estimates ( Additional file 2 : Table S3 ) in each country to assess the representativeness of the sample [ 26 ] . The distribution of contacts by contactees’ age group ( 0 – 17 , 18 – 55 , 56 – 100 ) and contact setting ( house - hold , visitor , work or study , and other ) was charac - terised ( Figs . 1 and 2 ) . In addition , we calculated the mean and median number of total daily contacts per country ( Additional file 2 : Table S4 ) , according to respondents’ gender ( male or female ) , residence loca - tion ( urban or rural ) , household - head education status ( no education , primary , secondary , tertiary , including post - graduate ) , household size ( 0 – 3 , 4 – 6 , or 7 + ) , self - reported health ( “Very bad” / “Bad” , “Fair” , or “Good” / “Very good” ) , past or present SARS - CoV - 2 infec - tion status ( yes , no , or uncertain ) , perceived COVID - 19 self - reported infection risk ( “Low” / “Very Low” , “Medium” , or “High” / “Very high” ) , the self - reported impact of COVID - 19 on health ( “Not at all” , “Some - what” , “Very” , or “Extremely” seriously ) , mask owner - ship ( " Yes " or " No " ) for surveys 1 and 2 , and vaccine acceptance ( “Definitely” , “Probably” , “Definitely not” , or “Probably not” ) for survey 2 ( Additional files 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 and 11 ) . A permutation test was performed for the main results to determine whether the differ - ences in the mean or median number of daily contacts per respondent were significant at the 1 % to 0 . 01 % lev - els or were due to chance , using the country - specific samples for each survey ( Additional file 2 : Table S5 ) . Entries with missing data on any of these variables were not included in the statistical analysis . Variables with notable or surprising differences are presented in Figs . 3 and 4 , while the remainder are included as addi - tional files . Finally , mean and median daily contacts were regressed against the change in mobility from pre - pan - demic levels and the stringency of restrictions ( Fig . 5 and Additional file 12 : Fig . S10 ) . For the change in mobility , publicly available national - level Google Com - munity Mobility Reports were used , which show mobil - ity trends in different locations ( retail and recreation , groceries and pharmacies , parks , transit stations , work - places , and residential ) [ 27 ] . The dependent variable was defined as the mean or median reported number of contacts in the surveyed countries . The independ - ent variable was defined as the mean change in mobility recorded across all locations during each survey period . No data were available for the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) , Ethiopia , Guinea , Liberia , Sudan , and Tunisia . The Oxford Government Response Stringency Index is a composite index of the stringency scores of eight indicators ( school closing , workplace closing , cancellation of public events , restrictions on gather - ings , closure of public transport , stay - at - home require - ments , restrictions on movement , and restrictions on international travel ) ( Additional file 2 : Table S6 ) [ 28 ] . The independent variable for this analysis was defined as the mean absolute stringency index reported dur - ing each survey period . The estimated model intercepts and coefficients are reported with their standard errors and p - values . Page 4 of 13 Dobreva et al .

BMC Medicine ( 2022 ) 20 : 344 Ethics Participation was voluntary , and data were anonymised . Interviewers explained the purpose of the study in the respondent’s preferred language , and informed consent was obtained before participation . Ipsos Mori , a market research company based in the United Kingdom ( UK ) , conducted the surveys . Ethical approvals from the Lon - don School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicines ( LSHTM ) were obtained for the survey ( Ref : 22486 - 1 ) and current analysis ( Ref : 25945 ) as well as from all national ethics committees . Results Respondent characteristics Twenty - three thousand nine hundred forty respondents and 563 , 976 contacts were analysed across the 18 coun - tries for survey 1 and 25 , 640 respondents and 607 , 142 contacts across the 19 countries for survey 2 . The per - centage of people who agreed to participate out of all people randomly called ( i . e . the participation rate ) was on average 41 % for survey 1 and 50 % for survey 2 ( Addi - tional file 2 : Table S7 ) . The lowest participation rate was recorded in Morocco for survey 2 of 11 % and the highest for Sudan in survey 2 of 83 % . Most countries had a par - ticipation rate of at least 30 % . For survey 1 , the median age of respondents ranged between 26 in Guinea and Zambia and 41 in Tunisia ; between 42 % ( Guinea ) and 52 % ( Sudan ) were female ( Table 1 ) . For survey 2 , the median age ranged between 26 in Guinea and Sudan and 41 in Morocco and Tuni - sia ; between 45 % ( Kenya ) and 53 % ( South Africa ) were female ( Additional file 2 : Table S3 ) . The sampled popu - lations followed a similar age structure across countries in both surveys . Considering the absence of the 0 – 17 age group , adults aged over 60 were under - sampled in all countries for both surveys ( Additional file 2 : Table S2 ) [ 26 ] . Female respondents were represented well , when compared to population estimates ( Additional file 2 : Table S3 ) [ 26 ] . Between 24 % ( Uganda ) and 58 % ( South Africa ) resided in urban areas in survey 1 and between 21 % ( Uganda ) and 67 % ( Tunisia ) in survey 2 . Compared to the World Urbanisation Prospects estimates ( Addi - tional file 2 : Table S3 ) [ 29 ] , the rural population was under - sampled in DRC , Ethiopia , Guinea , and Sudan and oversampled in Cameroon and South Africa in survey 1 . The rural population was somewhat under - sampled in DRC and Kenya and oversampled in Nigeria and South Africa in survey 2 . For the remaining countries , the rural and urban populations were represented well . The median household size ranged between 5 and 9 in survey 1 ( Table 1 ) and between 4 and 10 in survey 2 Fig . 1 Percentage of contacts out of total average recorded contacts by contactees’ age group and country in surveys 1 and 2 Page 6 of 13 Dobreva et al . BMC Medicine ( 2022 ) 20 : 344 ( Additional file 2 : Table S1 ) . In most countries , respond - ents had primary , secondary or tertiary education representing between 20 % and 55 % of the survey 1 respondents . Similar was the case for survey 2 , except in Morocco and Guinea where over 35 % of the respondents had no education ( Additional file 2 : Table S1 ) . In Survey 1 , Guinea , Kenya , Liberia , Mozambique , and Uganda , approximately 30 % of respondents had an income of $ 0 – $ 100 . In Zimbabwe , these were 83 % of the respond - ents . In Cameroon , DRC , Egypt , Ethiopia , Ghana , Ivory Coast , Nigeria , Sudan , Tunisia , and Zambia , those with an income of $ 101 – $ 500 USD represented 40 % or more of the sample . These in turn represented 35 % and 28 % of the samples in Senegal and South Africa , respectively . 20 % of the observations for Cameroon , Mozambique , Nigeria , South Africa , and Senegal were missing income data . Reported income was not comparable across coun - tries for survey 2 as it was recorded in the local currency . Contact patterns The majority of contacts in each country occurred with contactees aged 18 to 55 , representing 50 % or over of total contacts for both surveys ( Fig . 1 ) . Between 20 % and 40 % of all contacts were with contactees aged 0 to 17 . A similar trend was observed for both surveys . Contacts with those over 55 were less than 20 % of total contacts in most countries . For both surveys , most con - tacts occurred in a household or work , school , or univer - sity settings ( Fig . 2 ) . Household contacts accounted for between 20 % and 40 % of all contacts . Contacts in work , school or university settings accounted for between 30 % and 40 % + of all contacts . The smallest number of con - tacts occurred in the remaining two settings ( other and visitors ) , except in Kenya , Mozambique , Sudan , and Zim - babwe , where other contacts accounted for the majority in survey 1 . Most countries displayed a similar pattern of contacts across survey rounds ( e . g . Cameroon , DRC , Egypt , Ghana , Guinea , Ivory Coast , Liberia , Senegal , South Africa , Sudan , and Zambia ) . However , there were some notable changes across survey rounds where most contacts occurred : from a household to a work / study set - ting in Ethiopia , Nigeria , Tunisia , and Uganda and from other to households in Mozambique and Zimbabwe . For survey 1 , the number of mean daily reported con - tacts per respondent varied greatly between countries ranging between 9 ( SD = 16 , median = 4 , IQR = 8 ) in Ethiopia and 41 ( SD = 56 , median = 20 , IQR = 41 ) in Cameroon ( Additional file 2 : Table S4 ) . For survey 2 , mean contacts ranged between 13 in Morocco ( SD = 15 , median = 8 , IQR = 11 ) and in Zimbabwe ( SD = 20 , Fig . 2 Percentage of contacts out of total average recorded contacts by contact setting and country in surveys 1 and 2 Page 7 of 13 Dobreva et al . BMC Medicine ( 2022 ) 20 : 344 median = 7 , IQR = 10 ) and 50 in Sudan ( SD = 53 , median = 33 , IQR = 40 ) . There was strong evidence to suggest that mean con - tacts increased between the surveys in Ethiopia ( from 9 to 21 ) , Ghana ( from 24 to 34 ) , Liberia ( from 27 to 35 ) , Nigeria ( from 19 to 28 ) , Sudan ( from 40 to 50 ) , and Uganda ( from 16 to 34 ) ( p - value < 0 . 0001 ) . For these , the increase in the median number of contacts was also sig - nificant for all but Liberia . Mean contacts decreased from 41 to 16 in Cameroon , 28 to 23 in DRC , and 25 to 16 in Tunisia ( p - value < 0 . 0001 ) . Of these , the decrease in the median number of contacts was significant for Cameroon and Tunisia at this significance level . This was consistent with changes in the stringency of restrictions ( Additional file 2 : Table S6 ) , except for Cameroon and DRC . In general , male respondents reported more mean or median contants than female respondents ( Fig . 3 and Additional file 2 : Table S5 ) . In survey 1 , male respondents reported significantly more mean contacts than female respondents in Cameroon ( 48 vs 33 ) , Egypt ( 29 vs 15 ) , Ethiopia ( 10 vs 7 ) , Ghana ( 28 vs 20 ) , Ivory Coast ( 26 vs 17 ) , Kenya ( 35 vs 22 ) , Mozambique ( 24 vs 15 ) , Nigeria ( 22 vs 16 ) , Sudan ( 53 vs 29 ) , Tunisia ( 32 vs 18 ) , and Uganda ( 18 vs 13 ) ( p < 0 . 0001 ) . Only in South Africa , no significant difference in the number of mean or median contacts was observed between the two genders . The overall trend was similar but no significant differences were observed for Ghana ( mean contacts for both genders of 34 ) and Ivory Coast ( 26 vs 25 ) in survey 2 . Male respondents in Morocco had double the contacts of female respondents ( 17 vs 8 , p < 0 . 0001 ) in survey 2 . The differences in the median reported contacts for both genders were less sig - nificant in comparison , but followed the same trend . The variation in the mean and median contacts by respondent’s location was less pronounced compared to that by gender ( Fig . 4 and Additional file 2 : Table S5 ) . However , respondents in urban locations had more con - tacts on average than those in rural locations in Cam - eroon ( survey 1 : 47 vs 35 ; survey 2 : 18 vs 13 , p < 0 . 0001 ) and Kenya ( survey 1 : 35 vs 26 ; survey 2 : 28 vs 23 , p < 0 . 01 ) . The opposite was the case in Senegal ( survey 1 : 17 vs 23 ; survey 2 : 17 vs 21 , p < 0 . 0001 ) and Zambia ( survey 2 : 23 vs 30 , p < 0 . 001 ) . Variations in the mean and median contacts by dif - ferent demographic characteristics or COVID - 19 per - ceptions over the two surveys are further reported in Additional files 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 and 11 . There were no substantial differences across countries in the num - ber of contacts by the household head education level ( Additional file 3 : Fig . S1 ) , the respondent’s self - reported Fig . 3 Median and mean contacts by country , survey wave , and respondent’s gender .

S4 ) , or possession of a mask ( Additional file 7 : Fig . S5 ) . Generally , respondents living in households of 7 or more members reported more non - household con - tacts ( work / study , visitor , or other ) than those in smaller households ( e . g . of 1 – 3 or 4 – 6 members ) ( Additional file 8 : Fig . S6 ) . In some countries ( e . g . Cameroon , DRC , Sudan ) , this applied to all contacts ( Additional file 9 : Fig . S7 ) . Somewhat surprisingly , we did not find consistent differences across countries and waves in the mean num - ber of contacts between respondents with low and high levels of perceived risk of catching SARS - CoV - 2 ( Addi - tional file 10 : Fig . S8 ) , and perceived risk to health ( Addi - tional file 11 : Fig . S9 ) . Mean daily contacts , mobility change , and stringency index The relationship between mean daily contacts and mobil - ity change and stringency index follows the expected pat - tern across survey waves ( Fig . 5 ) . Mean daily contacts increase as mobility increases and decline as the strin - gency of restrictions increases . In particular , an increase of one percentage point in mobility is associated with an increase of 0 . 57 ( standard errors ( SE ) : 0 . 26 , p = 0 . 0513 ) contacts for survey 1 and 0 . 28 ( SE : 0 . 25 , p = 0 . 2910 ) for survey 2 , though neither are significant at the 5 % level . A decrease of one unit in the stringency index was asso - ciated with a decrease of 0 . 12 ( SE : 0 . 11 , p = 0 . 3041 ) con - tacts for survey 1 and 0 . 33 ( SE : 0 . 10 , p = 0 . 0045 ) for survey 2 , significant at the 5 % level . A similar relationship is observed between median daily contacts and mobil - ity change and the stringency index ( Additional file 12 : Fig . S10 ) . However , the magnitude of the coefficient on mobility and stringency and their standard errors decreased compared to when mean contacts were used . A potential explanation for this is that using the mead - ian estimate instead of the mean decreases the variation in observations in the contacts by country . This in turn leads to a more significant but potentially diluted coeffi - cient estimate . Discussion These data show that social contacts differ markedly between and within countries . We also find an inverse relationship between the stringency of restrictions and mean contacts , suggesting that the implementation of NPIs follows their intent . We find that contacts were the lowest in Ethiopia ( survey 1 ) and Morocco and Zimba - bwe ( survey 2 ) , and the highest in Cameroon ( survey 1 ) and Sudan ( survey 2 ) . The majority of contacts occurred in the household or work / study settings for both surveys . Most contacts occurred with people of working age ( 18 – 55 ) , reflecting the generally higher social interac - tions associated with participating in economic activities . On average , men had more contacts than women and , in most countries , mean contacts did not differ by the respondent’s area of residence , except in Cameroon and Kenya ( where respondents in urban locations reported more contacts than those in rural ) and in Senegal and Zambia ( where the opposite was observed ) . Notably , considering that the surveys were conducted when contacts were discouraged , the reported mean number of contacts is consistently higher compared to previous estimates , for the countries where prior contact data are available [ 13 , 15 , 16 , 18 , 19 , 21 , 22 ] . The median number of reported contacts is closer to the past mean estimates . This could be due to a number of reasons . Firstly , while the respondent sample is close to nation - ally representative , respondents of working age ( 18 – 55 ) are slightly oversampled , potentially leading to a higher number of contacts . Additionally , many other studies report primarily on rural or semi / peri - urban commu - nities or selected regions [ 13 , 16 , 18 , 19 , 21 , 22 ] , mak - ing direct comparisons challenging . Finally , variations in the surveys’ methodologies could also be driving the observed differences—in the current study contacts were estimated rather than listed leading to reduced precision and potentially increased variability . Other studies have also found that men have more contacts than women , reflecting gender differences in economic activities outside the home in some commu - nities [ 15 , 30 ] . The finding that Senegalese respondents in urban areas make less contacts than in rural areas is consistent with findings of a prior Senegalese study on face - to - face contacts [ 19 ] . Surprisingly ( and in contrast to our findings ) , available contact studies in Kenya , South Africa , and Zimbabwe report more contacts for rural rather than urban areas [ 14 , 16 , 21 , 22 ] . This could be due to differences in the sampled populations and / or the defi - nition of a contact . We find that mean contacts increased between the two time points in Ethiopia , Ghana , Liberia , Nigeria , Sudan , and Uganda and decreased in Cameroon , DRC , and Tunisia , reflecting the opposite change in the restrictions between the two time points in all countries but Came - roon and DRC . We cannot exclude external factors that may confound this relationship . While the Cameroon and DRC findings are surprising , this could be due to , among many reasons , chance , poor quality stringency data , or because people are not responding to the restrictions . There was a lack of significant difference in the number of contacts according to respondents’ perception of the COVID - 19 risk to health in both surveys . This contrasts prior studies in high - income settings—a study in the UK Page 10 of 13 Dobreva et al . BMC Medicine ( 2022 ) 20 : 344 reported fewer mean contacts for those who agreed that COVID - 19 would have a high impact on their health than those who did not agree [ 31 ] . However , risk percep - tions might impact contact patterns differently in low - and - middle - income countries . For example , a survey in communities of Tamil Nadu , India found that the major - ity of respondents perceived low level of risk of contract - ing COVID - 19 , whereby more common concerns were related to loss of income , inability to travel , or getting sick [ 32 ] . Other studies also support the finding that most contacts occur in non - household settings [ 13 , 18 ] and , when tighter restrictions are in place such as a national lockdown , the proportion of household contacts is higher than in other contact settings [ 33 ] . More contacts of respondents in larger households than smaller ones have also been reported elsewhere [ 12 ] . There are some methodological limitations of this study . Firstly , the contact surveys in each country were conducted retrospectively via structured telephone interviews , prone to responder recall bias and fatigue . These may have led to respondents omitting contacts or rounding down or up their number of reported con - tacts . An improved study design might use prospec - tive contact diaries that record individual contacts , or structured questionnaires that aim to minimise recall bias by thoroughly guiding respondents through their day and listing all contacts [ 34 ] . Additionally , recent technological advances in wearable proximity sensors have enabled researchers to measure epidemiologically important close contacts in resource - limited settings [ 17 ] . This remains an important area for future research . However , such designs were not feasible for this study given that collecting contacts data was not the primary focus of the survey , but also because of the large sam - ple size ( over 1000 observations ) across the 18 and 19 countries in surveys 1 and 2 , respectively . The direction of the responder bias is unknown since contacts could be both rounded up or down and therefore the total contacts per country could be under or overestimated . Nevertheless , a strength of this survey , in addition to the large sample size , is that it captured a range of char - acteristics about the contacts and the respondents . Col - lecting data on multiple variables could have made a prospective design more burdensome and introduced a high rate of loss to follow - up . In addition , participants were asked to report the num - ber of social contacts they had , having been asked about COVID - 19 transmission risk and attitudes , and we can - not rule out that social desirability bias may have affected responses . While the extent of this occurring is difficult to determine , such bias would result in respondents under - reporting the number of contacts leading to overall lower average number of contacts recorded for a given country . Thirdly , a prerequisite for participation in the tele - phone survey was access to a functioning telephone , con - nectivity , and electricity , which might be limited in some countries , particularly in rural areas . Indeed , comparing the proportion of rural and urban participants to the World Urbanisation Prospects database showed that the rural population was under - sampled in DRC , Ethiopia , Guinea , and Sudan in survey 1 and in DRC and Kenya in survey 2 , which might affect the generalisability of the reported mean contacts in those countries . Fourthly , the participation rate for the two surveys was satisfactory given the survey design of randomly digit - dialling a great number of people and given that the two samples remained balanced against the general popu - lation on observed characteristics such as gender and location . Thus , it is unlikely that this introduced a strong bias in the results . However , there may unobserved char - acteristics which drive people to participate and which may have introduced bias in the contacts data . If this was the case , the direction and magnitude of the bias remains unknown . Regarding the regression analysis , this relies on a small sample size of 18 – 19 countries and in the case of mobil - ity even fewer since no mobility data existed for DRC , Ethiopia , Guinea , Liberia , Sudan , and Tunisia . While the observed relationship followed the expected pattern ( e . g . mean / median contacts increased with increasing mobil - ity and decreased with increasing intensity of the restric - tions across countries , albeit with weak significance ) , the analysis may have been underpowered to detect statisti - cally significant patterns in the data and did not account for confounding factors . Nevertheless , the observed rela - tionship validates that the collected data on contact pat - terns are of good quality . Finally , google mobility data patterns over - represent urban areas given the limited access to mobile phone , Google maps , and internet connection in rural areas . While we found no significant differences between the number of contacts in rural compared to urban areas in most countries , the observed relationship between mobility ( biased towards urban areas ) and the number of mean contacts per country is likely weakened due to the inherently different sample characteristics . Nevertheless , this analysis illustrates an informative finding that there is a correlation between the number of contacts and mobility change . Conclusions These are the first COVID - 19 social contact data col - lected and mean daily contacts reported for the majority of studied countries ( all but Kenya , Ethiopia , and South Africa ) . We found a high reported number of daily con - tacts in all countries as well as large variations in mean Page 11 of 13 Dobreva et al . BMC Medicine ( 2022 ) 20 : 344 contacts across countries . We also found large variations by gender whereby men had on average more daily con - tacts than women . We found no consistent patterns in the variation of mean contacts by other characteristics across the two survey waves and countries . We found that increased stringency and decreased mobility were associated with a reduction in the number of contacts . These findings can be useful for infectious disease modelling studies in low - and middle - income settings . In particular , we offer an empirical basis for assump - tions around the expected number of contacts by coun - try , urban / rural location , and gender . There are also some important learnings for policy makers and implementers involved in pandemic planning and response . For exam - ple , the stringency index had a relatively small coefficient and was weakly associated with the number of reported contacts per country , although the strength of the asso - ciation improved between the two surveys . While con - trol measures need to be appropriately implemented to ensure adherence , our study suggests they may have lim - ited effects on reducing contacts in the countries studied . This highlights the need to develop locally appropriate social control measures that are implementable . It also stresses the necessary support for communities to help ensure adherance to individual measures ( e . g . through the provision of resources such as improved risk com - munication strategies , infection , prevention and control materials , and clean water and soap for handwashing ) .
