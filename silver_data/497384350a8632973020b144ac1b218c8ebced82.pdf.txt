A . , Toulouse , France ABSTRACT Genome dynamics are intimately linked to the regulation of gene expression , the most fundamental mechanism in biology , yet we still do not know whether the very process of transcription drives spatial organization at speciﬁc gene loci . Here , we have optimized the ANCHOR / ParB DNA - labeling system for real - time imaging of a single - copy , estrogen - inducible trans - gene in human cells . Motion of an ANCHOR3 - tagged DNA locus was recorded in the same cell before and during the appear - ance of nascent MS2 - labeled mRNA . We found that transcription initiation by RNA polymerase 2 resulted in conﬁnement of the mRNA - producing gene domain within minutes . Transcription - induced conﬁnement occurred in each single cell independently of initial , highly heterogeneous mobility . Constrained mobility was maintained even when inhibiting polymerase elongation . Chro - matin motion at constant step size within a largely conﬁned area hence leads to increased collisions that are compatible with the formation of gene - speciﬁc chromatin domains , and reﬂect the assembly of functional protein hubs and DNA processing during the rate - limiting steps of transcription . INTRODUCTION Three - dimensional ( 3D ) organization of the genome con - tributes signiﬁcantly to regulation of all major nuclear pro - cesses . Changes in average positions of chromosome loci in a population of cells correlate with local or global changes in DNA metabolism ( 1 – 9 ) . This is notably the case for gene transcription , where active genes tend to associate with clusters of RNA polymerase II ( pol2 ) ( 10 ) . By imaging pol2 , its cofactors , and mRNA , these transcription hubs have been shown to be relatively immobile ( 11 – 14 ) , but the mo - tion of the associated DNA has not been reported . Conse - quently , we do not know if the observed reduced protein mobility is an intrinsic property of the transcription ma - chinery or an indirect effect of changes in chromatin confor - mation . Whichever the cause , the precise kinetics of this reorganization at timescales short enough to determine chromatin physical properties have not been analyzed in mammalian cells . Indeed , real - time analysis of chromatin at short time scales relevant for the analysis of transcription activation ( minutes ) has been hampered by methodological limitations . Existing technologies to visualize DNA loci usually rely on highly repetitive sequences , based on the insertion of hundreds of repeats of bacterial operator sequences to which ﬂuorescent repressor fusion proteins bind with high afﬁnity ( called FROS for ﬂuorescent repressor operator system ( 8 ) ) , or using multiplexed short guide RNAs that stably recruit catalytically inactive dCas9 - green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) fusion proteins to a large , repetitive genomic region and partially unwind the target DNA sequence ( 15 , 16 ) . These technologies have conﬁrmed that transcription impacts the nuclear localization of gene domains . However , they do not allow tagging of genes within the immediate vicinity of regulatory elements for fear of disturbing their very function . Nevertheless , it was shown that , in yeast , the mobility of a gene was increased by permanently recruiting the potent activator VP16 or chromatin remodeling factors ( 17 ) . This effect could stem from constitutive local decondensation of chro - matin near the labeled gene . In mouse embryonic stem cells , in contrast , using dCas9 - GFP targeted to MS2 sequence repeats inserted near the Nanog gene , it was reported that Submitted April 12 , 2017 , and accepted for publication August 4 , 2017 . * Correspondence : kerstin . bystricky @ ibcg . biotoul . fr Thomas Germier and Silvia Kocanova contributed equally to this work .

In both studies gene motion was compared in different cells . To truly assess immediate changes in chromatin motion during transcription activation , DNA dynamics of a single - copy gene have to be analyzed in real - time whilst simultaneously monitoring steps of mRNA synthesis in the same cell . To achieve this , we developed a novel ANCHOR DNA labeling system ( ANCHOR3 ) for use in human cells . ANCHOR is based on insertion of a nonrepetitive , short ( < 1 kb ) DNA sequence ( ANCH ) to which a limited number of OR ( bacterial partition protein or ParB ) bind site - specif - ically . Oligomerization via N - terminal protein - protein interaction leads to accumulation of OR proteins , which nonspeciﬁcally and dynamically associate with adjacent DNA and form a ﬂuorescent focus ( 19 – 21 ) . In yeast , OR / ParB was shown to spread over DNA within chromatin up to 2 kb from the ANCH sequence ( 22 ) . The ANCH site can be placed immediately next to a genomic locus of inter - est without disturbing DNA function in eukaryotic cells . For example , DNA resection from a HO cleavage site in yeast was normal despite the presence of an OR - bound ANCH site only 76 bp next to it , viral gene expression and subse - quent infectious behavior in mammalian cells was preserved when inserting an ANCH - and OR - GFP - expressing cassette into the dense herpes virus genome ( unpublished data ; http : / / www . neovirtech . com ) , and transcription activation was fully functional from transgenes placed on a plasmid or within the mammalian genome when ANCH was inserted immediately next to promoters ( this study and unpublished observations ) . Hence , stable insertion of the ANCHOR system into cells in which transcription of target genes can be activated under physiological conditions enables ﬂuorescence imaging of a single locus in the same cell over time , without interfering with gene expression . In this study , we demonstrate that the optimized ANCHOR3 system in combination with the MS2 system ( 23 ) is ideally suited for simultaneous visualization of DNA and mRNA at a single - gene level in living human cells at high - spatiotemporal resolution . We show that transcrip - tion initiation , not elongation , constrains local displacement of the hormone - induced Cyclin D1 gene as an immediate response to the transcription process in human cells . MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell line The human breast cancer cell line MCF - 7 ( purchased from American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC ) ) was used to generate stable FRT / LacZeo clones . Cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle medium ( DMEM ) F - 12 ( red DMEM / F12 ) completed with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( Gibco ) , 1 % Sodium Pyruvate ( Gibco ) , and 0 . 5 % gentamicin ( Gibco ) , or in phenol red free DMEM / F12 completed with 10 % charcoal stripped serum , 1 % Sodium Pyruvate ( Gibco ) , and 0 . 5 % gentamicin ( Gibco ) , in a water - satu - rated atmosphere containing 5 % CO 2 at 37 (cid:1) C . Transfections were carried out using FuGENE HD Transfection Reagent ( Promega ) , according to the supplier’s recommendation . ANCHOR3 labeling system ANCH3 corresponds to a speciﬁc chromosome partition sequence and was ampliﬁed directly by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) from the genome of an undisclosed exotic bacteria ( the ANCHOR system is the property of NeoVirTech SAS ; requests of use : contact @ neovirtech . com ) . The PCR product was then cloned using Bam H1 / Hin dIII into pCDNA FRT vector di - gested by Bgl II / Hin dIII ( Invitrogen ) . Insertion was veriﬁed by Apa I diges - tion and sequencing . OR3 corresponding to the cognate ParB protein was ampliﬁed by PCR and cloned via Bgl II / Kpn I directly into pGFP - c1 digested by the same enzyme . Insertion was veriﬁed by digestion and sequencing . Functionality of the construct was veriﬁed by cotransfection of both vectors in HeLa cells and produced clearly identiﬁable ﬂuorescent spots . To construct the ANCH3 - CCND1 - MS2 transgene ( Fig . 1 a ) , the ANCH3 sequence was ampliﬁed by PCR with primers containing Eco RV restriction sites and ligated into the Eco RV - digested pCDNA5 - FRT / CCND1pr - HA - CCND1 / 24MS2 / 3 0 UTR plasmid ( kindly provided by Yaron Shav - Tal ( 23 ) ) . Engineering of stable FRT / LacZeo clones expressing the CCND1 transgene MCF - 7 cells were transfected using a pFRT / / lacZeo kit from Invitrogen according to the supplier’s protocol . Selection of FRT clones was per - formed using 75 m g / mL Zeocin ( InvivoGen ) in red DMEM / F12 medium . Selection medium was renewed every 3 days . Three clones , showing the same growing behavior and ER a - target gene expression proﬁles as MCF - 7 cells were kept for use : G7 , A11 , and D11 . Clones G7 , A11 , and D11 were transfected with 1 m g of ANCH3 - CCND1 - MS2 or ANCH3 plas - mids and 6 m g of plasmid pOG44 encoding Flipase ( Invitrogen ) . Selection of positive clones was performed with 75 m g / mL Hygromycin ( Invitrogen ) , and presence of a single ﬂuorescent focus was veriﬁed by ﬂuorescence microscopy 24 h after cell transfection with 500 ng OR3 - Santaka . Santaka is ATUM’s synthetic nonaequorea ﬂuorescent protein that can be ampliﬁed by PCR and cloned into any daughter expression vector of choice ( https : / / www . atum . bio / products / expression - vectors / mammalian ? hl ¼ santaka ) . ANCH3 - CCND1 - MS2 cells as well as control cells with only an ANCH3 insertion were maintained in red DMEM / F12 completed with 75 m g / mL Hygromycin .

Forty images were acquired at a 5 s time interval . After three pre - bleachimages , acircularregionofinterest ( ROI ) ( 12pixelswide ) containing the ANCHOR spot was bleached with ﬁve iterations and maximal laser po - wer . For bleaching controls , cells with spots were acquired with the same conditionsasintheFRAPexperimentsbutwithoutbleachingtheﬂuorescent spot . The z - position was stabilized using Zeiss Deﬁnite Focus . Due to hard - ware limitations , the ﬁrst four images have a time interval between 3 . 4 and 6 . 6s . Thesereproducibledifferencesweretakenintoaccountintheanalysis . The image analysis was performed using FiJi ( http : / / ﬁji . sc / Fiji ) . For each FRAP time course , the position of the OR3 - EGFP ANCHOR spot was tracked in 3D using the FiJi MOSAIC plugin for 3D single - particle tracking ( http : / / mosaic . mpi - cbg . de / ? q ¼ downloads / imageJ ( 24 ) ) . If a spot was not detectable after photobleaching , its position was interpolated . The mean ﬂuorescence intensity F s was measured in a 5 (cid:3) 5 rectangular region around the tracked spot . The background ﬂuorescence intensity F bg was measured from a ROI in the unbleached part of the nucleus . Relative ﬂuorescence in - tensity RI at time point t i ( Fig .

The bleaching rate k bl was estimated from the FRAP time courses without bleaching the ANCHOR3 spots . Overall bleaching was below 10 % within the acquired 40 frames . The postbleach kinetics were ﬁtted to a single exponential func - tion as described in the legend to Fig . S1 d . Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and protein number estimation Imaging and photon counts were acquired on a Zeiss LSM780 ConfoCor3 confocal microscope using a 40 (cid:3) , 1 . 2 NA , water Korr FCS objective . Cells were imaged ( D x , D y ¼ 83 nm , D z ¼ 0 . 4 , 164 (cid:3) 164 pixels , 9 z - slices ) and subsequently two positions in the nucleus outside of ANCHOR3 spots were selected for FCS at the z - position of the central slice . For imaging , GFP was excited with a 488 nm laser ( Ar , 25 mW , 0 . 4 % AOTF transmission , 2 . 3 m W at probe ) and detected with a GaAsP detector using a 492 – 552 nm detection window . For pre - FCS imaging , the same detector settings , pixel size , pixel dwell time , and laser settings were used as for FRAP , allowing the conver - sion of ﬂuorescence intensities in the ﬁrst prebleach FRAP images to con - centrations and protein numbers based on an FCS calibration ( Eq . 3 ) . For FCS , GFP was excited with a 488 nm laser ( Ar , 25 mW , 0 . 05 % AOTF trans - mission , 0 . 28 m W at probe ) and the photon counts were recorded for 30 s using an avalanche photodiode detector ( 505 – 590 nm detection ) . To esti - mate the effective volume , a water solution of Alexa488 ( Lifetech ) with a known diffusion coefﬁcient ( D alexa ¼ 441 m m 2 s (cid:4) 1 , M . Wachsmuth , personal communication ) was measured before each experiment . The raw photon counts were processed using FluctuationAnalyzer 4G ( http : / / www . embl . de / (cid:5) wachsmut / downloads . html ) . This program com - putes the autocorrelation function ( ACF ) , correction factors , e . g . due to background , and ﬁts the ACF to physical models of diffusion ( see ( 25 ) , for further details ) .

The mean FI was measured in a 5 (cid:3) 5 px large square at the location of the FCS measurement . The data points were ﬁt to a line that describes the relationship between ﬂuorescence intensity FI and concentration C : C ¼ a þ b FI : ( 3 ) Based on Eq . 3 , each pixel of images acquired with the same settings as the pre - FCS images can be converted to a concentration . The protein num - ber in each voxel was obtained by multiplying the concentration C with the voxel volume V vox and N A ( see Fig . S1 e ) .

For the ﬁt , the Gauss Fit on Spot ImageJ plugin ( http : / / imagej . nih . gov / ij / plugins / gauss - ﬁt - spot / index . html ) was used . Fluorescence live cell imaging under stimulation For live cell tracking during transcription activation , 100 , 000 cells were plated in 35 mm glass - bottom culture plates ( Ibidi , Biovalley ) in red DMEM / F12 medium and allowed to attach for 24 h . Red DMEM / F12 me - dium was changed for phenol red free DMEM / F12 medium supplemented with 10 % charcoal stripped serum , without hygromycin , and cells were kept in the latter medium for 72 h . Cells were cotransfected with 500 ng OR3 - Santaka and 1 m g MCP - GFP DNA vectors 24 h before observation . To activate transcription of the ANCH3 - CCND1 - MS2 transgene , cells were maintained in L - 15 medium ( Liebovitz’s , Gibco ) supplemented with 10 % charcoal stripped serum , a buffer appropriate for live cell imaging . Observations were made using a Nipkow - disk confocal system ( Revolu - tion ; Andor ) installed on a microscope ( IX - 81 ) , featuring a confocal spinning disk unit ( CSU22 ; Yokogawa ) and a cooled electron multi - plying charge - coupled device camera ( DU 888 ; Andor ) . The system was controlled using the Revolution IQ software ( Andor ) . Images were acquired using a 60 (cid:3) Plan Apo 1 . 42 oil immersion objective and a two - fold lens in the optical path . Single laser lines used for excitation were diode - pumped solid - state lasers exciting GFP ﬂuorescence at 488 nm ( 50 mW ; Coherent ) and Santaka ﬂuorescence at 561 nm , and a Quad band pass emission ﬁlter ( Di01 - T405 / 488 / 568 / 647 - 13 (cid:3) 15 (cid:3) 0 , 5 ; Semrock ) allowed collection of the green and red ﬂuorescence . Pixel size was 110 nm . Movies containing 200 image frames acquired with an exposure time of 250 ms were recorded . Images were processed using ICY and FIJI software ( http : / / icy . bioimageanalysis . org / ; http : / / ﬁji . sc / Fiji ) . Germier et al . 1386 Biophysical Journal 113 , 1383 – 1394 , October 3 , 2017 After imaging of the cells without transcription stimulation , 100 nM 17 b - estradiol ( E2 ; Sigma ) was added directly under the microscope and dy - namics of the OR3 - Santaka spot in the same cells were recorded 45 min later . Before acquisition under E2 stimulation , presence of the MCP - GFP foci , indicating active transcription elongation , was veriﬁed in each analyzed cell ( Fig . 1 c ) . To block transcription elongation , we added fresh L - 15 medium containing 50 m M DRB ( 5 , 6 - dichloro - 1 - b - D - ribofuranosyl - benzimidazole ; Sigma ) . The cells were imaged 30 min after DRB addition and disappearance of the MCP - GFP foci was veriﬁed ( Fig . 3 b ) . To examine the impact of transcription initiation on chromatin motion in living cells , we added fresh L - 15 medium containing 500 nM Triptolide ( TPL , Sigma ) before or after stimulation by E2 . The cells were imaged under the same conditions as for DRB treatment . To study the effect of OH - Tamoxifen ( OH - Tam ; Sigma ) , cells were maintained in L - 15 medium and imaged before and 45 min after 1 m M OH - Tam treatment . Lateral drift test Lateral drift was analyzed by cross correlation . Cross correlation assumes that shape of the structures imaged in the sample is not expected to change signiﬁcantly during the acquisition ; the structure itself can be used to determine whether spatial shift between subsequent images exists . For single - cell analysis , movies were cropped and registered by the ImageJ plug - in StackReg using translation and rigid body functions for drift correc - tion , before tracking of the DNA locus using ICY tracker ( 26 ) . The trans - lation function calculates the amount of translation ( D r ) by a vectoring analysis from x ¼ r þ D r , where x and r are the output and input coordi - nates . Rigid body transformation is appropriate because coordinates are x ¼ { { cos q , (cid:4) sin q } , { sin q , cos q } } , r þ D r , considering both the amount of translation ( D r ) and the rotation by an angle q ( 27 ) . Mean - square displacement Particle tracking experiments and mean - square displacement ( MSD ) calculations were carried out using ICY and MatLab software ( http : / / icy . bioimageanalysis . org / ; https : / / fr . mathworks . com / ) . Tracks of 200 frames were scored . OR3 - Santaka spots were detected and tracked using the Spot detector and spot tracking plug - in from ICY in single cells . MSDs were calculated in MatLab using the following equation : dl 2 ð j ; i Þ ¼ ð x ð j þ i Þ - x ð i ÞÞ 2 þ ð y ð j þ i Þ - y ð i ÞÞ 2 : ( 5 ) Averaged MSD resulted from averaging the MSD at each time interval ( Fig . 2 b , n ¼ 14 ) . Mean MSD were extracted from the average squared displacement from 2 to 40 s of the ANCH3 locus during the time of acqui - sition in one cell ( Figs . 2 c and 3 , c , d , f , and g , n ¼ 15 , n ¼ 21 , n ¼ 9 , n ¼ 7 , n ¼ 3 , and n ¼ 10 , respectively ) . Areas of conﬁnement were obtained using the raw trajectories over 50 s and ﬁtted based on an ellipse using the freely available software package GNU Octave to draw a conﬁdence ellipse that contains 95 % of all recorded positions ( http : / / www . visiondummy . com / 2014 / 04 / draw - error - ellipse - representing - covariance - matrix / ) .

RESULTS To simultaneously visualize DNA and mRNA of a single gene , we labeled a Cyclin D1 ( CCND1 ) transgene with a new , improved ANCHOR3 system ( see Materials and Methods ) . The ANCHOR system was derived from pro - karyotic chromosome partitioning components and origi - nally implemented in yeast ( 22 ) . Speciﬁc association of a few ParB / OR protein dimers to a limited number of parS binding sites within the bacterial chromosome’s parti - tioning site initiates formation of a large nucleoprotein complex dependent on nonspeciﬁc , dynamic ParB / OR bind - ing and ensuing oligomerization ( 19 – 21 ) . The ANCHOR system thus relies simply on a short ANCH / INT sequence ( < 1 kb ) that can be inserted immediately adjacent , within a few basepairs , to regulatory elements . The transgene is further composed of the endogenous CCND1 promoter , a CCND1 cDNA cassette including its 3 0 enhancer region , and 24 repeats of the MS2 MCP protein - binding sequence within the CCND1 3 0 UTR ( 23 ) ( Fig . 1 a ) . The construct was inserted into an FRT site within the genome of estrogen receptor alpha ( ER a ) - positive MCF - 7 human mammary tumor cells ( Fig . 1 a ) . In the engi - neered , monoclonal cells , called ANCH3 - CCND1 - MS2 , ﬂuorescent OR3 - fusion proteins form a single focus at the ANCH3 site of the transgene that can be readily tracked in real - time ( Fig . 1 b ; Movies S1 and S2 ) . To characterize the binding kinetics of OR3 proteins at and around the ANCH3 site , we used FRAP of OR3 - EGFP labeled spots ( Fig . 1 b ) . Association and dissociation of OR3 - EGFP at the ANCH3 - tagged site was in a dynamic steady state with a measured half - life of 57 5 2 s ( Fig . 1 b ) . To estimate the copy number of OR3 proteins at an ANCH3 site in steady state , we per - formed confocal imaging calibrated by FCS , which allowed us to convert pixel ﬂuorescence intensity to protein concen - tration or number ( Fig . S1 , a , b , c , d , and e ) . The ﬂuorescence intensity of the ANCHOR3 spot increased with OR3 - EGFP abundance ( Fig . S1 f ) . Under our OR3 expression conditions , we calculated an average of 481 5 274ﬂuorescent molecules per site , corresponding to a signiﬁcant ampliﬁcation of the nine OR3 dimers bound speciﬁcally to the parS sites of the ANCH3 sequence ( Fig . S1 f ) . The MCP - EGFP signal corresponding to accumulated CCND1 transcripts is detectable near the ANCHOR3 - labeled DNA site 45 min after 17 b - estradiol ( E2 ) addition to G1 - synchronized cells grown in steroid - stripped media ( Fig . 1 c ; Movie S2 ) , consistent with the fact that ER a target gene expression is triggered 10 min after E2 addition ( 28 , 29 ) . Fluorescence intensity of the OR3 spot did not vary upon transcription activation , conﬁrming that events leading to mRNA production of the tagged locus do not interfere with OR3 accumulation . If any , displaced OR3 molecules reassociate faster than variations in intensity can be detected using our acquisition settings . Thus , the en - gineered cell line enabled real - time imaging of a single - copy gene during transcription activation by the endogenous ER a , under physiological conditions . To directly test whether changes in gene expression impact local chromatin dynamics , we recorded the motion Real - Time Single Gene Tracking Biophysical Journal 113 , 1383 – 1394 , October 3 , 2017 1387 FIGURE 2 Cyclin D1 motion is conﬁned during estradiol induced transcription activation .

( c ) Average squared displacement between 2 and 40 s ( mean MSD ) of single cells ( n ¼ 9 ) treated successively ( legend continued on next page ) Real - Time Single Gene Tracking Biophysical Journal 113 , 1383 – 1394 , October 3 , 2017 1389 of the ﬂuorescent ANCHOR3 - Santaka - tagged gene in the same cell before and 45 min after adding 100 nM E2 , whilst monitoring the appearance of MCP - EGFP - labeled mRNA signals ( Fig . 1 c ) . Live cell tracking revealed that movement of the CCND1 gene is locally constrained upon induction of its transcription ( Fig . 1 d ; Table 1 ) . We quantiﬁed the average displacement of the tagged transgene by plotting the MSD to each time interval D t ( see Materials and Methods ) . MSD curves calculated from time - lapse image series acquired with an interframe interval of 250 ms for a total of 50 s are shown in Fig . 2 a . We found that MSD plots of E2 - activated CCND1 differed signiﬁcantly from those of nonactivated cells ( Fig . 2 a , left panels ; Figs . S2 and S3 ) . In contrast , E2 had no effect on the behavior of a nongenic ANCH3 - only construct integrated at the same genomic location ( Fig . 2 a , right panels ; Figs . S2 and S3 ) , conﬁrming that the measured decline in mobility was due to transcrip - tion of the transgene rather than to unspeciﬁc , genome - wide effects of hormone addition . We also examined the motion of the ANCH3 - CCND1 - MS2 or ANCH3 - only constructs in - serted into distinct chromosomes ( G7 , A11 , and D11 clones ; Fig . 2 a ; Fig . S2 ) . At the single - cell level , we recorded large variations in MSD of the transgene in all clones , but these variations did not correlate with any speciﬁc insertion site ( Fig . S2 ) . Coherent with the observation that the mobility of genetic loci is highly heterogeneous , modeling of nucle - osome dynamics in HeLa cells suggests that subdiffusive behavior of chromatin depends on compaction levels and chromatin domain structure ( 30 ) . Intriguingly , motion of the ANCH3 - tagged single - gene locus followed two distinct regimes with an increase in the slope of the recorded MSD at time intervals > 5 s in these human mammary tumor cells synchronized in G1 ( Fig . 2 b , left panel ; Fig . S2 ) . The average MSD curves over 21 trajectories followed a nonlinear , anomalous diffu - sive behavior characteristic of objects moving in complex environments such as the nucleoplasm ( 31 ) ( Fig . S2 ) . Hence , we analyzed these MSDs on the basis of a general - ized diffusion model obeying a power law MSD (cid:5) k t a with k as prefactor , t the time interval , and a the anomalous diffusion exponent , a model shown to reﬂect chromatin mo - tion in several cell types and under various conditions ( 32 ) . Applying this model to our data , we demonstrate that at short < 5 s time intervals , diffusion of the chromatin ﬁber of a single - gene domain is highly anomalous ( a < 0 . 4 ) and subjected to local constraints . At greater time intervals , the slope of the population - averaged MSD curve increases ( a (cid:5) 1 ) , suggesting that the ﬁber of the nontranscribed gene locus ( ANCH3 - CCND1 - MS2 or ANCH3 only ) is rather mobile , almost freely diffusing . In contrast , the dynamic behavior of the mRNA - producing CCND1 loci differs signiﬁcantly : the MSD slope remains low ( a (cid:5) 0 . 5 ) consis - tent with signiﬁcant conﬁnement of the actively transcribed locus ( Fig . 2 b ) . To fully exploit our ability to track a single gene , we computed an average squared displacement from 2 s to 40 s ( mean MSD ) before and after induction of transcription in the same cell . For both constructs , in the absence of E2 , the mean MSD ranged from 0 . 009 to 0 . 290 m m 2 ( Fig . 2 c ) . This heterogeneity in the amplitude of motion is coherent with variations in the nuclearenvironment owing to crowding in mammalian nuclei ( 18 , 33 , 34 ) . Independently of the initial mobility , mean MSDs recorded for each cell producing MCP - labeled mRNA were consistently reduced after addi - tion of E2 to ANCH3 - CCND1 - MS2 cells ( Fig . 2 c , left panel ; between 0 . 006 and 0 . 090 m m 2 ; n ¼ 15 ; p - value ¼ 0 . 006 ) . In contrast , variations in mean MSD of the nongenic ANCH3 locus were not signiﬁcantly affected by E2 addition ( Fig . 2 c , right panel ; n ¼ 21 ; p - value ¼ 0 . 3 ) . To more accurately describe the behavior of the tracked chromatin locus , we determined its area of conﬁnement and speed in addition to time - averaged MSDs , which suffer from approximating experimental errors ( 35 ) . We found that spatial conﬁnement of the transcribed locus reﬂected obstructed diffusion . The nuclear area explored by the tagged locus over a 50 s time interval in the absence of hormone was reduced by 27 % upon addition of E2 , from 0 . 156 5 0 . 08 m m 2 ( no E2 , no detectable MCP labeled mRNA ) to 0 . 114 5 0 . 06 m m 2 ( visible mRNA accumulation at the tagged locus after 45 min E2 , n ¼ 26 ) ( Fig . 2 d ; Table 1 ) . Conﬁnement of the chromatin ﬁber could stem from steric hindrance due to protein loading or a change in the physical parameters of the ﬁber , or both ( 36 ) . We ﬁrst tested whether recruitment of large transcriptional cofactor com - plexes by hormone - bound ER a to the CCND1 promoter could inﬂuence chromatin mobility . Similarly to E2 , OH - Tam triggers ER a binding to responsive promoters , which leads to recruitment of numerous proteins and chromatin remodeling complexes ; in contrast to E2 , OH - Tam - bound ER a attracts transcriptional corepressors ( 37 , 38 ) . After addition of 1 m M OH - Tam , motion of the ANCH3 - tagged CCND1 locus was not conﬁned . Motion was similar to the dynamic behavior of the constructs in the absence of hormone although more homogeneous , likely due to the presence of corepressor complexes ( Fig . S3 ) . We conclude that association of a multitude of transcriptional cofactors recruited by OH - Tam - bound ER a alone , in the absence of transcription , cannot explain the observed local conﬁnement of the chromatin ﬁber . with E2 and then DRB .

Germier et al . 1390 Biophysical Journal 113 , 1383 – 1394 , October 3 , 2017 We next assessed the role of pol2 activity on motion of the tagged CCND1 locus using two distinct pol2 inhibitors ( Fig . 3 ) . E2 - stimulated cells were treated with an elongation inhibitor , the adenosine analog DRB . In contrast to ﬂavopir - idol , DRB action is reversible , rapid , and homogenous after 30 min ( 39 ) . CCND1 mRNA signals disappeared 30minafter addition of 50 m M DRB to E2 - treated ANCH3 - CCND1 - MS2 cells indicating that completion of elongation , i . e . , transcrip - tion of the 3 0 UTR including MS2 repeats , was efﬁciently in - hibited ( Fig . 3 b ) . The appearance of the MSD plot of the CCND1 locus tracking after DRB addition to cells main - tained in E2 - containing medium was similar to the one in cells that had not been treated with DRB ( Fig . 3 b , single - cell MSD curves ) , suggesting that conﬁned motion was sus - tained despite blocking elongation . Mean MSD values and area of conﬁnement for several cells analyzed 45 min after E2 stimulation and 30 min after adding DRB also did not change signiﬁcantly ( Fig . 3 c ; Table 1 ) . When pretreating cells for 30 min by DRB before adding hormone , we again observed a rapid decline in CCND1 motion upon mRNA pro - duction in every single cell analyzed ( Fig . 3 d ) . It is further known that in DRB - treated cells , transcription initiation by pol2 is preserved but elongation aborts rapidly within the ﬁrst transcribed exon ( 40 ) . Our observations let us speculate that initiating but not elongating pol2 conﬁnes chromatin dy - namics locally . To conﬁrm this hypothesis , we analyzed the tagged gene’s motion in cells treated with 500 nM TPL , an inhibitor of TFIIH that blocks pol2 at the promoter after tran - scription preinitiation complex ( PIC ) assembly ( 41 , 42 ) ( Fig . 3 a ) . An increase in mean MSD values and in area of conﬁnement of the ANCHOR3 spot’s track 30 min after addi - tion of TPL to E2 - stimulated mRNA - producing cells sug - gests that constraint of the ANCH3 - tagged transgene was released by blocking initiation ( Fig . 3 , e and f ; Table 1 ) . Furthermore , addition of E2 to TPL pretreated cells did not alter the recorded motion of the transgene ( p ¼ 0 . 6 ; Fig . 3 g ; Table 1 ) compared to DRB pretreated cells ( Fig . 3 d ) . Hence , our data suggest that events linked to PIC formation induce changes in chromatin mobility , leading to increased local mobility at time scales > 5 s within a largely conﬁned area . DISCUSSION Real - time tracking of a single - copy Cyclin D1 gene in the same cell before and during hormone - induced mRNA syn - thesis revealed that transcription initiation rapidly conﬁnes the mRNA - producing gene and alters its diffusive behavior . Conﬁnement was maintained even upon inhibition of pol2 elongation , but did not occur when recruitment of pol2 or transcription initiation was blocked by antiestrogens or TPL . Our results suggest that PIC formation and concomi - tant reorganization of the chromatin domain constrain freedom of movement of an induced gene’s promoter within minutes , compatible with the establishment of a tran - scriptional hub . Indeed , RNA polymerases aggregate in numerous rather immobile foci ( 13 , 43 ) . Several models concur in saying that a small fraction of active pol2 forms clusters with reduced mobility as transcription initiates ( 11 , 13 , 44 ) . This clustering is dependent on the presence of initiating pol2 complexes ( 45 ) . But what causes pol2 to stop moving ? In principle , our observation that transcription initiation locally conﬁnes chromatin dynamics within mi - nutes is compatible with the idea that pol2 foci assemble at active genes , and that , as the transcription initiation bub - ble forms , a decline in DNA freedom of movement leads to reduced pol2 mobility . Regulation of the CCND1 locus has been shown to involve intragenic looping ( 46 ) . Such conformational changes in gene domain organization , similar to those observed during glucocorticoid - stimulated transcription of MMTV tandem array gene loci in mouse adenocarci - noma cells ( 47 ) , are likely to have direct consequences for chromatin dynamics . For instance , anchoring of several chromosome ﬁbers within pol2 foci may increase the drag coefﬁcient and hence reduce chromatin displacements . The changes in local dynamics we describe are , thus , compatible with reorganization of preexisting chromatin folding within the gene domain at the 100 - kb range via long - range looping ( 1 , 9 , 48 ) .

Real - Time Single Gene Tracking Biophysical Journal 113 , 1383 – 1394 , October 3 , 2017 1391 of the transcribed locus at constant step size increases the frequency of interaction with transcriptional cofactors and polymerases of the gene within its regulatory compart - ment , similar to what was recently modeled as a ‘‘nano - reactor’’ ( 49 ) . Increased collisions are compatible with the formation of gene domain speciﬁc chromatin clus - tering ( also called ‘‘topologically associated domains’’ or TADs ) readily detected by crosslinking methods in mam - mary tumor cells ( 50 , 51 ; unpublished ) . In turn , conﬁned dynamics may prevent formation of unwanted long - range contacts as transcription proceeds . At the submegabase level , TADs comprise one or a few open reading frames and their regulatory elements ( gene domains ) ( 52 ) , particularly in human mammary tumor cells ( 48 , 50 , 53 , 54 ) ( unpublished data ) . If the existence of TADs is elusive in yeast , increased ligation frequencies also occur around gene bodies at the 2 kb range ( 55 ) . Most of our knowledge of chromatin dynamics stems from work in budding yeast ( 56 – 59 ) . In particular , live cell chromatin motion of a series of tagged genomic yeast loci ﬁts a Rouse model of polymer dynamics , in which the MSD increases with time with a power - law scaling and an anomaly expo - nent a (cid:5) 0 . 5 ( 60 ) . Assuming that within a (cid:5) 100 kb chro - matin domain around any of the tagged sites , at least one gene is actively transcribed in a population of yeast nuclei , the reported dynamic behavior characterizes active chro - matin . In agreement , obstructed diffusion characterizes the active CyclinD1 transgene locus in human cells here . In the absence of transcription the tagged single human transgene domain was highly dynamic , nearly freely diffusing . Similarly , our observations in yeast evidence increased motion when mutating RNA pol2 ( unpublished data ) . Transcription - induced , pol2 - dependent , intradomain contacts therefore likely result from the apparent diffusive behavior of chromatin in living cells . In mammalian cells , ATP - driven processes by chromatin remodeling factors ( 61 ) or other chromatin - associated proteins such as SAF - A ( 62 ) may contribute to the observed local motion and variation in anomaly . Anomalous diffusion was also reported for telomeres ( 63 ) and for gene arrays ( 64 ) but changes were derived from comparing motion in cells monitored under different conditions . The computed MSD curves of these loci characterized by speciﬁc struc - tures differ from the ones we compute for a single - gene lo - cus , which emphasizes the need for future modeling to better deﬁne physical parameters of the chromatin ﬁber in human cells . The powerful real - time imaging approach of a single DNA locus undergoing functional changes presented here using the ANCHOR system is widely applicable to other loci and genomes for studying rapid biological processes with single - cell resolution , and completing the picture emerging from imaging RNA pol2 and mRNA , but also from chromosome conformation capture data .
