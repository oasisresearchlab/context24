CHUVA DE SOUSA LOPES , email : lopes @ lumc . nl 19 20 2 SUMMARY 21 Current human primordial germ cell like cells ( hPGCLCs ) differentiation methods from human 22 pluripotent stem cells ( hPSCs ) are inefficient , and it is challenging to generate sufficient 23 hPGCLCs to optimize in vitro gametogenesis . We present a new differentiation method that 24 uses diluted basement membrane extract ( BME ) and low BMP4 concentration to efficiently 25 induce hPGCLC differentiation in scalable 2D cell culture . We show that BME overlay 26 potentiated BMP / SMAD signaling , induced lumenogenesis and increased expression of key 27 hPGCLC - progenitor markers such as TFAP2A and EOMES . These findings highlight the 28 importance of ( factors in ) BME during hPGCLC differentiation , and demonstrate the potential 29 of the BME - overlay method to interrogate the formation of PGCs and amnion in humans as 30 well to investigate the next steps to achieve in vitro gametogenesis . 31 32 33 KEYWORDS 34 Primordial germ cells , differentiation , pluripotent stem cells , human , amnion , basement 35 membrane extract , BMP , in vitro gametogenesis 36 37 38 HIGHLIGHTS 39 • hPGCLCs can be generated efficiently in 2D from hPSCs with treatment of BMP4 and BME 40 overlay 41 • BME overlay method is highly scalable , cost - effective and simple to perform 42 • hPGCLCs differentiate together with amniotic ectoderm - and mesoderm - like cells from a 43 TFAP2A + / CDX2 + / EOMES + / GATA3 + common progenitor population 44 • BME overlay enables robust hPGCLC formation by potentiating BMP / SMAD signaling in the 45 common progenitor population 46 47 3 INTRODUCTION 48 In mammals , gametogenesis is a complex and long process that is initiated by the 49 specification and lineage restriction of the primordial germ cells ( PGCs ) , the founding 50 population of the gametes ( Czukiewska and Chuva de Sousa Lopes , 2022 ) . Recapitulating 51 ( female and male ) gametogenesis in vitro would enable modeling of infertility - causing 52 diseases and may ultimately lead to new assisted reproduction techniques . 53 In mice , Bmp4 was identified as a crucial morphogen inducing PGC specification in the 54 posterior - proximal epiblast ( Lawson et al . , 1999 ) . Acting through the intracellular factors 55 Smad1 / 5 / 9 , Bmp4 is able to upregulate Tbxt ( Brachyury or T ) as well a specific gene regulatory 56 network that includes Prdm1 , Prdm14 and Tfap2c ( Saitou and Hayashi , 2021 ) . This knowledge 57 has led to the recapitulation of mouse PGC - like cell ( PGCLC ) formation in vitro , involving the 58 exposure of mouse pluripotent stem cells ( PSCs ) grown as embryoid bodies ( EBs ) to BMP4 59 ( Saitou and Hayashi , 2021 ) . Subsequently , human PGCLCs ( hPGCLCs ) have been generated 60 from human pluripotent stem cells ( hPSCs ) uncovering the divergent mechanisms of PGC 61 specification in mice and humans as well as differences in their molecular signature ( Fang et 62 al . , 2022 ) . 63 The origin of PGCs in mice and humans in vivo may also differ . In mice , specified PGCs 64 are located in the posterior - proximal epiblast at the base of the allantois shortly after the 65 onset of gastrulation . Although it remains unknown when and where exactly PGC 66 specification takes place in humans , in non - human primate embryos of cynomolgus monkeys 67 PGCs were first observed in the amnion prior to gastrulation ( Sasaki et al . , 2016 ) . In contrast 68 to mice and pig that undergo amniogenesis by folding , humans and non - human primates 69 undergo amniogenesis by cavitation ( Chuva de Sousa Lopes et al . , 2022 ; Eakin and Behringer , 70 2004 ) and may share similar origin of PGCs . In agreement , hPGCLCs share a common TFAP2A + 71 progenitor with amnion ectoderm - like cells in EB - differentiation assays ( Chen et al . , 2019 ) 72 and hPGCLC formation has been demonstrated in an amniotic sac embryoid model ( Zheng et 73 al . , 2019 ; Zheng et al . , 2022 ) . 74 The most widely used directed - differentiation protocols from hPSCs to hPGCLCs 75 include aggregation into EBs and treatment with high concentration of BMP4 . However , while 76 these EB - based methods were instrumental in understanding hPGCLC formation ( Irie et al . , 77 2015 ; Sasaki et al . , 2015 ) , they are characterized by low efficiency and high variability per 78 hPSC line ( Chang et al . , 2021 ; Chen et al . , 2017 ) . Reported hPGCLC yields ranged from 5 % - 79 60 % , with efficiencies above 30 % being uncommon , and with many hPSCs showing hPGCLC - 80 differentiation yields below 10 % . In addition , EB differentiation is low throughput , laborious , 81 and requires harsh and stressful cell dissociation , and as a result , efficient hPGCLC generation 82 for high throughput downstream experiments to optimize human gametogenesis in vitro . 83 remains challenging . 84 In this study , we have uncovered a critical role of extracellular matrix ( ECM ) during 85 hPGCLC differentiation from hPSCs in 2 - dimentional ( 2D ) culture . We show that 86 supplementation with basement membrane extract ( BME ) and a concentration as low as 87 10ng / ml of BMP4 using an ordinary 2D cell culture format is sufficient to consistently generate 88 4 high hPGCLC - yields between 30 - 50 % within 5 days of differentiation . The hPGCLCs in this 2D 89 system originated from a TFAP2A + CDX2 + GATA3 + EOMES + progenitor population , that also 90 gave rise to both amniotic ectoderm - like and presumably amniotic mesoderm - like cells . 91 Importantly , the presented hPGCLC - differentiation method is highly scalable and cost - 92 effective , which will greatly facilitate progress achieving human in vitro gametogenesis ( IVG ) . 93 94 95 RESULTS 96 Robust generation of hPGCLCs in 2D culture with BME overlay 97 The application of diluted BME on 2D plated hPSCs ( BME overlay ) has been shown to 98 be important to induce lumenogenesis ( Taniguchi et al . , 2015 ) , enabling that system to model 99 aspects of early human embryogenesis ( Karzbrun et al . , 2021 ) . As hPGCLCs formed readily in 100 the amniotic sac embryoid model , that consisted of BMP4 - treated hPSC - spheres cultured on 101 a microfluidic device ( Zheng et al . , 2019 ) , we hypothesized that BME - supplemented culture 102 may facilitate the generation of hPGCLCs in regular 2D culture formats . To test this , single cell - 103 passaged human induced PSCs ( hiPSCs ) were plated in mTeSR - plus medium supplemented 104 with 2 % BME ( Day 0 , D0 ) ( Figure 1A ) . One day later ( D1 ) , the medium was replaced with 105 previously described hPGCLC - induction medium ( Kobayashi et al . , 2017 ) containing 200ng / ml 106 BMP4 as well as stem cell factor ( SCF ) , leukemia inhibitory factor ( LIF ) and epidermal growth 107 factor ( EGF ) . The differentiation was carried out in hPGCLC - induction medium for 4 days ( D1 - 108 D5 ) with the medium in the initial 2 days ( D1 - D3 ) supplemented with 2 % BME ( Figure 1A ) . 109 Pronounced morphological differences were observed when hiPSCs were 110 differentiated with the BME overlay ( Figure 1B ) . In contrast to the flat colonies observed in 111 the absence of BME overlay , tightly packed colonies were present in the presence of BME 112 overlay . Immunofluorescence on D5 of differentiation revealed a large number of 113 ITGA6 + POU5F1 + SOX17 + hPGCLCs only in the BME overlay condition across three 114 independent hPSC lines , M54 ( Figure 1C ) , F99 and H1 ( Figure S1A ) , in addition to the 115 expression of other known PGC markers , such as TFAP2C , PDPN , PRDM1 and ALPL ( Figure 116 S1B ) . In agreement , flow cytometry analysis using PGC markers ITGA6 and EPCAM ( Mishra et 117 al . , 2021 ; Sasaki et al . , 2015 ) revealed the generation of hPGCLCs with efficiencies of about 118 50 % in line M54 , whereas basically no hPGCLCs were detected in the absence BME overlay 119 ( Figure 1D , S1C ) , revealing a critical role for cell - ECM interaction during hPGCLC 120 differentiation . 121 The response of hPSCs to BMP4 signaling is highly dependent on both culture format 122 and cell density ( Etoc et al . , 2016 ; Nemashkalo et al . , 2017 ) . The hPGCLC induction medium 123 contained a high dose of BMP4 ( 200ng / ml ) , which was optimized for EB - based methods . To 124 establish the optimal BMP4 dosage in our 2D system , we tested different concentrations of 125 BMP4 , while removing SCF , LIF and EGF from D1 - D3 and reducing the concentration of BMP4 126 to 10ng / ml from D3 - D5 ( Figure 1E ) . Strikingly , we observed comparable efficiencies to induce 127 ( ITGA6 + EPCAM + ) hPGCLCs with vastly reduced BMP4 concentrations in six independent hPSC 128 5 lines ( Figure 1F , S1D ) . Using immunofluorescence , we further confirmed an associated 129 increase in POU5F1 + SOX17 + hPGCLCs ( Figure 1G ) . 130 In previous work using EB - based differentiation , we identified lines F20 and M72 as 131 inefficient hPGCLC - generating lines ( Chang et al . , 2021 ) . We observed the same in BME 132 overlay differentiation , with F20 yielding 15 % and M72 0 . 3 % respectively ( Figure S1D ) . This 133 suggests that variance in hPGCLC generation efficiency could be an inherent cell line property 134 and not dependent on the differentiation method used . 135 It was previously demonstrated that ActA / NODAL induced hPGCLC differentiation 136 competency in hPSCs ( Kobayashi et al . , 2017 ) . Moreover , the addition of a low dose of ActA 137 together with BMP4 improved the specification of hPGCLCs in micropatterned colonies ( Jo et 138 al . , 2022 ) . Hence , we tested whether exogenous ActA could increase induction of hPGCLCs in 139 our system ( Figure 1H ) . We observed that simultaneous treatment with BMP4 and ActA from 140 D1 - D3 lowered the hPGCLCs yield in all tested concentrations , compared to treatment with 141 BMP4 alone ( Figure 1H ) , shortening the ActA treatment from D1 - D2 gave a similarly poor 142 outcome ( Figure S1E ) . Interestingly , inhibiting endogenous TGF b / ActA signalling by blocking 143 the receptor type I ( ALK4 / ACVR1B , ALK5 / TGFBR1 , ALK7 / ACVR1C ) using SB431542 in our 144 system reduced hPGCLC formation ( Figure 1H , S1E ) . 145 146 hPGCLCs differentiated together with amniotic ectoderm - like and mesoderm - like cells 147 To understand the cell types present in our BME overlay model during differentiation 148 ( 2 % BME overlay from D0 - D3 and 10ng / ml BMP4 from D1 - D5 ) , we performed single cell 149 transcriptomics of two hPGCLC - efficient lines ( M54 and F99 ) and two hPGCLC - inefficient lines 150 ( F20 and M72 ) at D0 , D2 and D5 ( Figure 2A , S2A ) . 151 Visualization by uniform manifold approximation and projection ( UMAP ) revealed the 152 presence of six clusters ( Cl0 - Cl5 ) ( Figure 2A ) . The top 12 most differentially expressed genes 153 ( DEGs ) ( based on the avg _ log2FC ) indicated that Cl0 - Cl1 consisted of D0 hPSCs expressing 154 high levels of SOX2 ; Cl5 consisted of D2 progenitor cells expressing high levels of BMP 155 signaling target genes ID1 and ID4 ; Cl3 corresponded to hPGCLCs expressing NANOS3 and 156 PDPN ; Cl2 seemed to correspond to human amniotic ectoderm - like cells ( hAELCs ) expressing 157 ISL1 , GATA3 , TFAP2A and KRT7 ; and Cl4 corresponded most probably to human amniotic 158 mesodermal - like cells ( hAMLCs ) expressing TMEM88 , BMP4 , COL3A1 and COL6A3 ( Figure 2B ) . 159 We further confirmed cell type identity by the expression of known markers genes 160 ( Chen et al . , 2019 ; Chuva de Sousa Lopes et al . , 2022 ; Tyser et al . , 2021 ) : hPGCLC ( Cl3 ) and 161 hPSCs ( Cl0 - Cl1 ) expressed high levels of POU5F1 and NANOG , but PRDM1 and SOX17 were 162 exclusively expressed by hPGCLCs ( Figure 2C ) ; hAELCs ( Cl2 ) and hAMLCs ( Cl4 ) shared high 163 expression of HAND1 , but only hAMLCs expressed high levels of GATA6 , PDGFRA and FOXF1 , 164 whereas many cells in hAELCs expressed ISL1 , TFAP2A , VTCN1 and IGFBP3 ( Figure 2C , S2B ) ; 165 and a small subset of cells in Cl2 expressed key endoderm markers FOXA2 , HNF1B , HNF4A 166 and SOX17 ( Tyser et al . , 2021 ) , presumably too small to result in a separate cluster ( Figure 167 S2C ) . As expected , CL3 ( hPGCLCs ) was almost exclusively composed of cells derived from the 168 efficient hPGCLC - generating PSCs lines M54 and F99 ( Figure S2A ) . 169 6 To compare the developmental timeline and cell types generated using our BME 170 overlay method with the EB - differentiation method , we merged our single - cell dataset with 171 the single - cell dataset published by Chen and colleagues ( Chen et al . , 2019 ) ( Figure 2D , S2D ) . 172 The molecular signatures were largely similar and the small population of human endoderm - 173 like cells ( part of Cl2 ) now formed an independent cluster together with cells previously 174 identified as primitive endoderm - like cells ( Figure 2E , S2E ) . Hence , our 2D - differentiation BME 175 overlay method is providing an alternative method for high - throughput generation of 176 hPGCLCs , while maintaining similar cell types obtained using a 3D - differentiation method . 177 Next , we validated by immunofluorescence the three main cell types present at D5 : 178 TFAP2C + / SOX17 + hPGCLCs , TPAP2A + / GATA3 + / SNAI2 + / KRT7 + hAELCs , and GATA6 + / PDGFRA + 179 hAMLCs ( Figure 2F , S2F ) . Finally , using human amnion from 9 weeks of gestation ( WG9 ) , we 180 confirmed by whole mount immunofluorescence the expression of TFAP2A in the amniotic 181 ectoderm , and GATA6 and PDGFRA in amniotic mesoderm ( Figure 2G ) . 182 183 Lumenogenesis and hPGCLC differentiation were independent events 184 A particular feature of BME overlay culture is the formation of lumen - containing 185 structures ( Taniguchi et al . , 2015 ) . Since we observed distinctive morphology resembling 186 tube / lumen structures in the BME overlay method , we investigated whether lumenogenesis 187 is linked to the differentiation of hPGCLCs . We were able to detect laminin deposition on top 188 of formed luminal structures on D2 differentiation with BME overlay ( Figure 3A ) . By contrast , 189 in the absence of the BME overlay , cells remained as a single cell layer ( Figure 3A ) . Moreover , 190 we observed the expression of basal - lateral markers ITGB1 and CTNNB1 , apical marker PODXL 191 and tight - junction marker TJP1 ( Figure 3A , 3B , S3A ) , confirming lumenogenesis at D1 - D2 . At 192 D3 , the lumen expanded and SOX17 + / PRDM1 + / PDPN + hPGCLCs were visible adjacent to the 193 lumen ( Figure 3C , 3D ) . At D5 , the lumens lost structural integrity and a large number of 194 SOX17 + hPGCLCs could be observed ( Figure 3D , S3B ) . In contrast to TPAP2A + hAELCs that 195 expressed a clear rim of TJP1 , SOX17 + hPGCLCs only showed a focal accumulation of TJP1 196 ( Figure S3B ) . 197 Next , we varied the period of the initial plating step ( mTesR - Plus + 2 % BME ) from 24 198 hours ( h ) to 0h ( cells plated directly in RB27 + 10ng / ml BMP4 + 2 % BME ) ( Figure 3E ) to 199 investigate whether hPGCLC differentiation depended on the timing of lumen formation . 200 Although the initial plating step was necessary to obtain hPGCLC differentiation , a 3h plating - 201 step was sufficient to obtain robust differentiation to hPGCLCs using two different lines , M54 202 ( Figure 3F ) and F99 ( Figure S3C ) . Interestingly , independent of the duration of the initial 203 plating step ( between 0h and 24h ) , small lumens marked by PODXL + TJP1 + apical membrane 204 domains were observed by D2 ( Figure 3G ) . In the absence of BME overlay , we observed 205 cellular polarization with the formation of a clear TJP1 + apical rim , but no lumen formation 206 ( Figure S3D ) . 207 To further test whether lumen maintenance at D2 was necessary for hPGCLCs 208 differentiation , we disrupted the lumens at D2 by dissociating and replating the cells , followed 209 by analysis at D5 ( Figure 3H ) . Despite the disruption of lumens at D2 , immunofluorescence 210 7 revealed formation of TFAP2C + / SOX17 + / POU5F1 + hPGCLCs ( Figure 3H ) . In conclusion , 211 lumenogenesis and hPGCLC differentiation appeared to be two independent events , and only 212 exposure to BME ( for a period as short as 3h ) prior to BMP4 + BME treatment ( for two days ) 213 was essential for hPGCLC differentiation . 214 215 BME overlay potentiates BMP4 signaling in the PGCLC progenitors at D2 216 We performed differential analysis between the PSCs at D0 ( Cl0 and Cl1 ) and the 217 progenitor population at D2 ( Cl5 ) and observed that from D0 to D2 DPPA4 and SOX2 were 218 downregulated , whereas many BMP responsive genes such as ID1 , ID4 , GATA3 , TFAP2A and 219 MSX2 were upregulated ( Figure 4A ) . In addition , TFAP2A was expressed in the progenitor cells 220 at D2 - D3 , but not in PRDM1 + / SOX17 + hPGCLCs at D5 ( Figure 4B , S4A ) . Interestingly , in the 221 absence of BME overlay , TFAP2A was basically absent at D2 ( Figure S4B ) , whereas GATA3 222 showed comparable levels with or without BME overlay at D2 - D3 ( Figure 4C , S4C ) . 223 To test whether the BMP4 signaling activity was influenced by BME overlay , we 224 examined the levels of phosphorylated ( p ) SMAD1 / 5 / 9 ( Figure 4C , S4C ) . Even though both 225 culture conditions ( with and without BME overlay ) contained 10ng / ml BMP4 , the 226 fluorescence intensity of nuclear pSMAD1 / 5 / 9 was higher in the presence of BME overlay in 227 particular at D2 ( Figure 4C , S4C ) . 228 In addition to TFAP2A and GATA3 , CDX2 and EOMES were also identified as markers 229 of hPGCLC progenitors in EB - differentiation ( Chen et al . , 2019 ) and BME overlay method 230 ( Figure S4D ) . In agreement , similarly to TFAP2A , both CDX2 and EOMES were upregulated at 231 D2 - D3 only in the presence of BME overlay ( Figure 4D , S4E , S4F ) . EOMES was previously 232 shown to be activated by ActA / NODAL signaling during hPGCLC differentiation and to 233 essential for initiating the hPGCLC transcriptional network ( Kobayashi et al . , 2017 ; Kojima et 234 al . , 2017 ) . However , we observed that the addition of exogenous ActA was detrimental for 235 hPGCLC differentiation in the BME overlay method ( Figure 1H ) . To understand this 236 discrepancy , we quantified the expression of EOMES , TFAP2A and SOX2 in the common 237 progenitor population at D2 in the presence or absence of BME overlay ; and after treatment 238 with 10ng / ml ActA or inhibition of endogenous TGF b / ActA signaling using 10 µ M SB431452 239 ( Figure 4D ) . 240 Compared to the absence of BME overlay , the D2 progenitors cultured with BME 241 overlay upregulated both TFAP2A and EOMES and downregulated SOX2 in line F99 ( Figure 242 4D , 4E ) and other lines F20 , M72 and F31 ( Figure S4F ) . When treated with 10ng / ml of BMP4 243 and 10ng / ml ActA in the presence of BME overlay , D2 progenitors upregulated EOMES 244 considerably , whereas inhibition of endogenous TGF b / ActA signaling blocked EOMES 245 expression ( Figure 4D , 4E ) , indicating that EOMES is strongly regulated by ActA signaling in 246 our culture system . Interestingly , treatment with a combination of BMP4 and ActA from D1 - 247 D3 with BME overlay resulted at D5 in the induction of SOX17 + FOXA2 + cells ( Figure S4G ) , 248 presumably endoderm , which is consistent with the role of ActA and its target EOMES in 249 endoderm differentiation ( Heslop et al . , 2022 ; Yoney et al . , 2022 ) . 250 8 In conclusion , in our optimized hPGCLC differentiation method , the addition of BME 251 overlay between D0 - D3 resulted in faster downregulation of SOX2 , increased pSMAD1 / 5 / 9 252 signaling , lumenogenesis and increased expression of TFAP2A , CDX2 and EOMES ( Figure 4F ) . 253 This led to the formation at D3 of nascent hPGCLCs , that downregulated TFAP2A and CDX2 , 254 upregulated NANOS3 by D5 , and which make up for about 50 % of the cells in culture alongside 255 amniotic ectoderm - and mesoderm - like cells ( Figure 4F ) . 256 257 258 DISCUSSION 259 The current methods to generate hPGCLCs in vitro have drawbacks regarding 260 efficiency and scalability . As a consequence , progress regarding the optimization of protocols 261 to further differentiate hPGCLCs into more mature germ cells , undergoing meiotic 262 progression in vitro , both in male and in females , has been hampered . We report a new 263 hPGCLC differentiation method that is efficient , simple , and cost effective in a highly scalable 264 2D format . This new method will contribute to accelerating the progression of human in vitro 265 gametogenesis research . 266 Using the BME overlay , hPSCs differentiate into hPGCLC alongside two other main cell 267 types , previously identified as amniotic ectoderm and ( amniotic ) extraembryonic mesoderm 268 ( Chen et al . , 2019 ) . We were able to verify by immunofluorescence that human amnion at 269 9WG consists of TFAP2A + amniotic ectoderm and PDGFRA + / GATA6 + amniotic mesoderm , 270 suggesting that the extraembryonic mesoderm - like cells were indeed amniotic mesoderm - 271 like cells . The recent single - cell transcriptomics dataset of a single gastrulating human 272 embryo , containing both amnion and hPGCs , is a tremendous resource for comparing in vitro 273 differentiated cells to in vivo counterparts ( Chuva de Sousa Lopes et al . , 2022 ; Tyser et al . , 274 2021 ) , confirming that the markers used are suitable to identify amniotic cell types . 275 The application of BME overlay primes hPSCs to gain competency to efficiently 276 differentiate to hPGCLCs . Priming hPSCs for 3h was sufficient and we report that ( some 277 component in ) BME acted directly and quickly to potentiate BMP signaling via pSMAD1 / 5 / 9 . 278 The ECM components of BME may interact with BMP4 directly , such as in drosophila , where 279 BMP4 homolog Dpp binds to collagen type IV which mediates BMP signaling ( Wang et al . , 280 2008 ) . Alternatively , ECM may change the availability and activity of the BMP receptors . For 281 example , ECM - integrin interactions reorder membrane into caveolae - rich lipid rafts domains 282 ( Kim et al . , 2011 ) , which is where BMPRI receptors are localized , affecting their activity ( Bonor 283 et al . , 2012 ; Ehrlich , 2016 ; Hartung et al . , 2006 ; Ramos et al . , 2006 ) . Finally , integrins activate 284 a multitude of downstream pathways that could result in crosstalk with BMP / SMAD signaling 285 ( Kim et al . , 2011 ) . 286 Downstream of BMP4 , BME - treated hPSCs showed increased pSMAD1 / 5 / 9 , leading to 287 upregulation of GATA3 , TFAP2A , CDX2 , and indirectly of EOMES . EOMES is essential for 288 hPGCLC formation ( Kobayashi et al . , 2017 ; Kojima et al . , 2017 ) , but its continued and high 289 expression has been shown to promote differentiation to endoderm ( Heslop et al . , 2022 ; 290 Yoney et al . , 2022 ) . Consistent with this , EOMES is moderately expressed in D2 - progenitor 291 9 cells exposed to the BME overlay . Moreover , in agreement with EOMES being a direct target 292 of TGFb / ActA signaling , the addition of ActA increases EOMES expression , resulting in a 293 reduction of the hPGCLC yield and a shift in the differentiation to SOX17 + / FOXA2 + endoderm 294 like cells . Surprisingly , in the absence of BME , the D2 - progenitors fail to upregulate EOMES . 295 This may explain why 3D differentiation methods have relied on ActA / CHIR99021 296 preinduction , which results in EOMES expression . 297 The observation that BME potentiates BMP / SMAD signaling has significance beyond 298 the field of in vitro gametogenesis . BMP4 is widely used in various differentiation protocols 299 and models of early embryogenesis ( Simunovic et al . , 2019 ; Warmflash et al . , 2014 ; Zheng et 300 al . , 2019 ; Zheng et al . , 2022 ) . Moreover , the presence of BME has proved beneficial for the 301 development of somite - like structures in a mouse 3D gastruloid stem - cell model ( van den 302 Brink et al . , 2020 ) as well as developing a peri - implantation assay for non - human primates 303 ( Yang et al . , 2021 ) . Hence , the combination of BME and treatment with BMP4 may prove 304 beneficial to mimic in vivo processes more accurately in human models of early 305 embryogenesis . 306 307 LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY 308 We established that a BME overlay method resulted in robust differentiation of 309 hPGCLCs for the majority of the tested hPSC lines , including commonly used ESC line H1 . 310 However , line F20 and M72 were characterized by low hPGCLC yields . The mechanism for 311 this line variability remains unclear , and users of the presented method will have to test hPSC 312 lines for compatibility . In addition , the presented method is reliant on BME isolated from 313 murine Engelbreth - Holm - Swarm ( EHS ) tumor , which is a complex mix of biologically active 314 compounds that may influence differentiation outcome , including trace amounts of growth 315 factors . Hence , the method presented is not chemically - defined nor clinical - grade . 316 317 318 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 319 We would like to thank the patient donating the human amnion material used in this study 320 as well as the staff of the Gynaikon Clinic in Rotterdam .

Chuva de Sousa Lopes ( lopes @ lumc . nl ) . 442 443 Materials availability 444 This study did not generate new unique materials or reagents . 445 446 EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS 447 Human samples and ethics statement 448 All experiments performed in this study were carried out strictly under the guidelines 449 specified in the Declaration of Helsinki for Medical Research involving Human Subjects . For 450 ethics approval , a letter of no objection was issued by the Medical Ethical Committee of 451 Leiden University Medical Center ( B21 . 054 ) . The human amnion sample used was collected 452 from elective abortion without medical indication , after obtaining informed consent from the 453 donor . The amnion ( 2 cm x 2 cm fragment ) was dissected in 0 . 9 % NaCl solution ( Fresenius 454 Kabi ) , fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) ( Sigma ) overnight ( o / n ) at 4°C washed three time 455 in PBS , and transferred to 70 % ethanol for storage at 4 ° C until further use . 456 457 Routine hPSCs culture 458 The hPSCs used in this study were either purchased from WiCell ( H1 ) or obtained from 459 the LUMC hiPSC core facility ( M54 , M72 , F20 , F31 , F99 ) . All 6 lines were cultured in mTeSR - 460 Plus media ( STEMCELL Technologies ) supplemented with MycoZap ( Lonza ) on tissue culture 461 plates coated with either Geltrex ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) or Cultrex ( R & D Systems ) diluted 462 in DMEM / F12 ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) at 1 % ( v / v ) concentration . Cells were cultured at 37°C 463 in a humidified normoxic incubator with 5 % CO 2 . Routine clump passaging was performed 464 every 4 - 7 days using ReLeSR ( Stem Cell Technologies ) . The starting cultures were 465 karyotypically normal and they were used for no more than 20 passages . 466 467 METHOD DETAILS 468 2D hPGCLC differentiation 469 High quality hiPSCs of 60 - 80 % confluency with minimal differentiation were used for 470 hPGCLC differentiation . Briefly , cells were dissociated with TryPLE ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) 471 at 37 ° C for 5 minutes ( min ) , diluted in DMEM / F12 ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) to stop digestion , 472 and spun down . Single cell suspension was resuspended in cold mTeSR - Plus media containing 473 17 RevitaCell supplement ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) and 2 % Geltrex or Cultrex at 2 . 04 x 10 5 474 cells / ml . We have obtained comparable hPGCLC differentiation using 10 µ M Y - 27632 ( Stem 475 Cell Technologies ) instead of RevitaCell . Depending on the plate format , the desired volume 476 of cell suspension was added to the Geltrex - or Cultrex - coated plate to achieve a final plating 477 density of 60 , 000 cells / cm 2 . On Day 1 ( 24 hours after plating ) , the medium was aspirated and 478 the cells were washed once with aRB27 basal medium [ advanced RPMI1640 ( Thermo Fisher 479 Scientific ) supplemented with B27 ( 1 : 100 ) ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) , 1X Glutamax ( Thermo 480 Fisher Scientific ) , 1X MEM Non - Essential Amino Acids ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) and Mycozap 481 ( Lonza ) ] . After washing , the differentiation media consisting of aRB27 with 2 % Geltrex or 482 Cultrex ( + BME overlay ) and 10ng / ml BMP4 ( R & D Systems ) was added to the cells [ or with 483 variations : omission of BME , varying BMP4 concentration and addition of SCF , LIF EGF , ActA 484 ( R & D Systems ) or SB431542 ( Tocris ) ] . Media exchange was performed the next day ( D2 ) and 485 on day 3 ( D3 ) , the medium was switched to aRB27 basal medium with 10 ng / ml BMP4 , 10 486 ng / ml human LIF ( PeproTech ) , 50 ng / ml SCF ( R & D Systems ) and 50 ng / ml EGF ( R & D Systems ) . 487 Medium change was performed daily until D5 . 488 489 Flow cytometry 490 Single cell suspension of the hPGCLC differentiation culture was generated by 491 incubating the cells with Accutase ( Stem Cell Technologies ) for 15 min at 37 ° C , followed by 492 vigorous pipetting to break up any clumps . The cell suspension was then passed through a 493 35 µ m nylon mesh strainer ( Corning ) , pelleted by centrifugation , washed once in FACS buffer 494 [ DPBS ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) with 0 . 5 % BSA ( Sigma - Aldrich ) ] , pelleted by centrifugation 495 and incubated with conjugated - antibodies diluted in FACS buffer at approximately 0 . 5 - 2x 10 6 496 cells / ml at 4 ° C for 30 min . Thereafter , the cell suspension was pelleted by centrifugation and 497 cells were resuspended in FACS buffer containing 7AAD ( BioLegend , 1 : 100 ) . The flow 498 cytometry analysis was performed on an LSR - II flow cytometer ( BD Biosciences ) . The FACS 499 data were collected from FACSDiva Software ( BD Biosciences ) and FlowJo Software ( BD 500 Biosciences ) were used for analysis . 501 502 Immunofluorescence and imaging 503 Cells cultured for imaging were either cultured on glass coverslips ( VWR ) or 18 - well μ - 504 slides ( Ibidi ) . At the time of analysis , cells were fixed in 4 % PFA for 15 min at room 505 temperature ( rt ) . The fixed cells were then washed three times with PBS and permeabilized 506 with 0 . 3 % Triton - X100 ( Sigma - Aldrich ) diluted in PBS for 15 min at rt , followed by three 507 washes with PBST ( 0 . 05 % Tween 20 ( Sigma - Aldrich ) in PBS ) . Cells were treated with blocking 508 buffer ( 1 % BSA diluted in PBST ) for 1 hour at rt and incubated with primary antibodies diluted 509 in blocking buffer at 4 ° C o / n . Next , the cells were washed three times with PBST and 510 incubated with secondary antibodies and DAPI ( Life Technologies ) diluted in blocking buffer 511 for 1 hour at rt , followed by three PBS washes . Cells in 18 - well μ - slides were imaged directly , 512 cells on coverslips were mounted with ProLong Gold ( Life Technologies ) . Imaging was 513 performed on either a 200 Series Dragonfly spinning disk confocal microscope ( Andor ) or a 514 18 TCS SP8 confocal microscope ( Leica ) . Renderings of image stacks were generated using the 515 Imaris surface creation functionality . Images were processed in Fiji ( ImageJ2 ) and Adobe 516 Photoshop ( Adobe ) . 517 518 Wholemount immunofluorescence and imaging 519 Amnion ( 2 cm x 2 cm fragment ) was washed three times 30 min in PBS at rt to remove 520 the 70 % ethanol solution . The tissue was permeabilized with 0 . 5 % Triton - X100 in PBS for 1 521 hour at rt , followed by o / n blocking in 0 . 2 % Triton - X100 with 1 % BSA in PBS ( whole mount 522 blocking buffer ) at 4 ° C . The tissue was then incubated with primary antibodies diluted in 523 whole mount blocking buffer for 24 hours at 4 ° C , washed three times in PBST for 15 min at rt 524 and incubated with secondary antibodies diluted in whole mount blocking buffer 3 hours at 525 rt . Finally , the tissue was washed three times with PBS for 15 min , mounted between cover 526 glass and glass slide using Prolong Gold and imaged on a 200 Series Dragonfly spinning disk 527 confocal microscope ( Andor ) . 528 529 Preparation cells for single - cell RNA - sequencing 530 BME - overlay cultures ( D2 and D5 ) and hPSCs ( D0 ) were digested with Accutase at 37 531 ° C for 15 min or shorter if single cell suspensions were obtained . Samples were washed once 532 in FACS buffer and centrifuged . Cells were then resuspended in FACS buffer , filtered through 533 the FACS tube strainer cap and treated with 7AAD diluted in FACS buffer at 1 : 100 dilution , on 534 ice for 3 min . Live cells were sorted on a CytoFLEX SRT benchtop cell sorter ( Beckman ) . The 535 collected live cells were sent to the Leiden Genome Technology Center ( LGTC ) for library 536 preparation using the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3 ' HT Kit v3 . 1 ( 10x Genomics ) according 537 to the manufacturers’ instructions and sequenced on NovaSeq6000 with V1 . 5 chemistry 538 ( illumina ) at Genome Scan . 539 540 QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS 541 Primary and secondary analysis of single - cell RNA - sequencing data 542 Raw RNA sequencing data was processed using the Cell Ranger pipeline ( v6 . 1 . 1 ) in 543 which reads were aligned to the human reference genome ( GRCh38 ) and gene UMI count 544 matrices were generated based on gene annotation in Cell Ranger reference annotation 545 version GRCh38 - 2020 - A . The R package Vireo2 ( v0 . 2 . 3 ) was used to distinguish cells from 546 different cell lines ( N = 4 ) based on genetic variation . Count matrices generated with Cell 547 Ranger were analyzed using Seurat ( v4 . 1 . 1 ) workflow in R ( v4 . 0 . 5 ) . Functions mentioned 548 below are part of the Seurat workflow unless specified otherwise . For quality control , cells 549 expressing < 2000 or > 7000 genes or cells having > 100000 UMIs were excluded from further 550 analysis . In addition , cells with > 10 % , or < 0 . 1 % of the total UMIs coming from mitochondrial 551 genes were excluded . Cells with > 6 % of UMIs mapping to dissociation - induced genes were 552 excluded as well ( van den Brink et al . , 2017 ) . Data was log - normalized using the 553 NormalizeData function ( scale factor : 100000 ) . To focus on cell type specific characteristics , 554 batch effect between cell lines ( N = 4 ) was corrected using the fastMNN function from R 555 19 package batchelor ( v1 . 6 . 0 ) . The top 2000 variable features ( genes ) were selected ( function : 556 FindVariableFeatures ) to perform Principal Component Analysis ( PCA ) ( function : RunPCA ) . 557 The first 15 principal components ( PCs ) were used to calculate cell clusters , with resolution 558 parameter set to 0 . 3 ( functions : FindNeighbors , FindClusters ) . Cells were visualized on a two - 559 dimensional plot calculated using the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection 560 ( UMAP ) algorithm ( function : RunUMAP ) . Differentially expressed genes ( DEGs ) for each 561 cluster were calculated using function FindAllMarkers ( parameters : only . pos = TRUE , min . pct 562 > 0 . 25 and logfc . threshold > 0 . 25 ) . Expression of individual genes were visualized using 563 functions FeaturePlot or VlnPlot . To generate heatmap data , mean expression of each gene 564 was calculated per cluster using base R functions , which were then filtered for top 12 565 differentially expressed genes per cluster ( ranking based on highest fold change ) , and 566 visualized using the pheatmap package ( v1 . 0 . 12 ) . For the combined analysis with Chen et al 567 data set ( UCLA2 ) ( Chen et al . , 2019 ) , we applied the same filtering parameters with regard to 568 global and mitochondrial gene expression as described above . Batch correction was done on 569 the two replicates in the Chen et al . data ( UCLA2 ) using the fastMNN function . The same 570 Seurat workflow was then applied as for the in - house dataset , with changes in the following 571 parameters : UMAP resolution parameter 0 . 27 . 572 573 Image quantification and visualization 574 The quantification of fluorescence intensity was performed using Fiji for image 575 handling and R package ggplot2 ( v3 . 3 . 5 ) for data visualization . First maximum intensity 576 projections were generated on Dragonfly confocal image stacks ( 2048 x 2048 pixels ; z - value : 577 10 - 12 ) , for three fields of view per analyzed condition . Images were segmented based on DAPI 578 channel to obtain areas representing nuclei . Segmentation consisted of thresholding DAPI 579 signal , generating an image mask , and performing additional segmentation using the Fiji 580 Watershed algorithm to separate overlapping nuclei . “Analyze particles” function was used 581 to obtain regions of interest ( minimum size set to 40 pixels ) , and mean fluorescence intensity 582 signals of nuclear markers in other channels were determined in these areas . Data were 583 loaded in R for filtering and visualization using ggplot2 ( geom _ jitter and geom _ violin ) . Data 584 was filtered for clear outliers that were a result of staining artefacts and autofluorescent 585 debris . In addition , areas above 300 pixels which likely represented multiple nuclei were 586 removed from the dataset . 587 588 20 REFERENCES 589 Bonor , J . , Adams , E .
