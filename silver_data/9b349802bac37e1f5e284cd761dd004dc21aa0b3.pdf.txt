Here , we 40 show that ERK3 , an atypical MAPK , directly acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange 41 factor for Cdc42 and phosphorylates the ARP3 subunit of the ARP2 / 3 complex at 42 S418 to promote filopodia formation and actin polymerization , respectively . 43 Consistently , depletion of ERK3 prevented both basal and EGF - dependent Rac1 and 44 Cdc42 activation , maintenance of F - actin content , filopodia formation and epithelial 45 cell migration . Further , ERK3 protein binds directly to the purified ARP2 / 3 complex 46 and augments polymerization of actin in vitro . ERK3 kinase activity is required for 47 the formation of actin - rich protrusions in mammalian cells . These findings unveil a 48 fundamentally unique pathway employed by cells to control actin - dependent cellular 49 functions . 50 51 52 53 54 3 Introduction 55 Actin is one of the most abundant and highly conserved proteins with over 95 % 56 homology among all isoforms 1 . In cells , it is present in globular / monomeric form ( G - 57 actin ) , which can polymerize into branched and elongated filamentous forms ( F - actin ) 58 in a dynamic , spatially and temporally controlled process 2 - 5 . The cytoplasmic actin 59 network constitutes an important part of the cytoskeleton , which not only 60 mechanically supports the plasma membrane and gives the cell its shape , but fulfils a 61 variety of other functions : It regulates velocity and directionality of cell migration , 62 enables intracellular signaling and transport , supports cell division and more 6 , 7 . 63 Moreover , by branching and bundling of F - actin filaments the actin cytoskeleton can 64 form unique structures such as lamellipodia and filopodia , which in epithelial cells 65 regulate cell polarization and are crucial for the contact with their environment , while 66 in other cell types these actin rich structures control motility , chemotaxis and 67 haptotaxis 8 - 12 . 68 69 To perform its cellular functions , the actin cytoskeleton must be able to rapidly 70 remodel in response to intrinsic and extrinsic cues 13 - 15 . The spatiotemporally defined 71 branching and elongation of the polymerized actin filaments is achieved by activation 72 of nucleation factors including the Actin - related protein 2 and 3 ( ARP2 / 3 ) complex , 73 Formins and Spire 16 - 23 . Actin nucleators facilitate formation of F - actin architectures , 74 branches and bundles , giving rise to specific actin - rich protrusions , thus generating 75 the pushing force required for membrane protrusion during migration 15 , 24 , 25 . It is well 76 established that ARP2 / 3 – dependent actin polymerization generates branched F - actin 77 network , while Formins generate unbranched filaments and promote growth of actin 78 filaments at the barbed end 21 , 26 , 27 . Two models of the filopodia initiation emerged , 79 where ARP2 / 3 and Formins are thought to be involved in the “convergent elongation” 80 and “tip nucleation” model , respectively . However , the proposed models are not 81 mutually exclusive and filopodia formation could engage both Arp2 / 3 and Formins 27 . 82 Moreover , both in vivo and in vitro experimental evidence upholds the essential role 83 for ARP2 / 3 complex - dependent actin nucelation in the formation of filopodia - like 84 protrusions 25 , 28 - 34 . 85 ARP2 / 3 complex is a major and highly conserved actin nucleator composed of seven 86 subunits 35 , 36 . The structural and biochemical properties of the ARP2 / 3 complex have 87 been intensively studied in vitro and apart from ATP , its activation relies on binding 88 4 to pre - formed actin filament and nucleation promoting factors ( NPFs ) 35 - 40 . The main 89 regulators of the ARP2 / 3 complex belong to the Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein 90 ( WASP ) family proteins , including WASP - family verprolin - homologous protein 91 ( WAVE ) 41 - 43 . WASP and WAVE proteins serve as a link between the actin 92 cytoskeleton and RhoGTPases via direct and intermediate binding to Cell division 93 control 42 ( Cdc42 ) and Ras - related C3 botulin toxin substrate 1 ( Rac1 ) , 94 respectively 17 , 18 . 95 The small Rho GTPases belong to the Ras homologous ( Rho ) superfamily of GTP - 96 binding proteins 44 . They function as binary molecular switches circulating between 97 active ( GTP bound ) and inactive ( GDP bound ) state . The on - off regulation of the Rho 98 GTPases is under the control of guanine exchange factors ( GEFs ) and GTPase 99 activating proteins ( GAPs ) 44 . GTP - bound active Cdc42 and Rac1 promote the 100 formation of filopodia and lamellipodia , respectively , by activating the NPFs , WASP 101 and WAVE 17 , 18 . Recent studies revealed a role for kinases in directly activating Rho 102 GTPases mainly through phosphorylation , but the identity of the relevant kinase ( s ) 103 remained elusive 45 - 49 . 104 ERK3 ( MAPK6 ) is an atypical member of the mitogen - activated protein kinases 105 ( MAPKs ) . Its physiological roles are tissue - specific and can be both dependent and 106 independent of its catalytic activity : Kinase - dependent roles of ERK3 include 107 promoting lung cancer cell migration and invasion , while its function in the regulation 108 of breast cancer cell morphology and migration is shown to be partially kinase - 109 independent 50 - 53 . Moreover , ERK3 is a labile protein whose rapid turnover has been 110 implicated in cellular differentiation 51 , 54 . Although the specific signaling mechanisms 111 involved in the regulation of ERK3 have been studied by us and others and provided 112 tissue - specific insights into this atypical MAPK function 51 , 53 , 55 - 58 , many aspects of 113 ERK3 biology such as its role in suppressing melanoma cell growth and invasiveness 114 remain elusive 59 . It is , however , known that ERK3 possesses a single phosphorylation 115 site at serine 189 ( S189 ) within S - E - G activation motif , located in its kinase domain , 116 which was shown to be phosphorylated by group I p - 21 - activated kinases ( PAKs ) , the 117 direct effectors of Rac1 and Cdc42 GTPases 60 - 62 . 118 119 ERK3 signaling is required for the motility and migration of different cancer cells , yet 120 its direct role in the regulation of the polarized phenotype of the cells and actin 121 cytoskeleton is lacking . Here , we unveil a multi - layered role for ERK3 in regulating 122 5 actin filament assembly . We demonstrate that ERK3 controls bundling of actin 123 filaments into filopodia via activation of Cdc42 . Mechanistically , ERK3 directly 124 binds to Rac1 and Cdc42 in a nucleotide - independent manner and is required for the 125 activity of both RhoGTPases in vivo . Furthermore , ERK3 could function as a direct 126 GEF for Cdc42 in vitro . In addition , ERK3 stimulates Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin 127 polymerization and maintains F - actin abundance in cells via direct binding and 128 phosphorylation of the ARP3 subunit at S418 . While the kinase activity is not 129 required for Cdc42 activation , Rac1 activity partially depends on ERK3 kinase 130 function . The in vivo relevance of these ERK3 functions was corroborated by analyses 131 of the motility of tumour cells in orthotopic mammary tumors grown in mice . 132 Together , our results establish a hitherto unknown regulatory pathway directly 133 controlled by ERK3 involving the major signaling molecules Cdc42 , Rac1 and 134 Arp2 / 3 in the modulation of the actin cytoskeleton and cell migration . 135 136 Results 137 138 ERK3 is required for motility of mammary epithelial cells 139 ERK3 has been shown to regulate mammary epithelial cancer cell migration and 140 metastasis 50 , 52 . To uncover the molecular underpinnings of the role of ERK3 in cell 141 migration , we investigated the intracellular localization of ERK3 by 142 immunocytochemical analyses using a validated antibody 51 , 52 . Endogenous ERK3 co - 143 localized to the F - actin - rich protrusions in human mammary epithelial cells ( HMECs ) 144 ( Figure 1A ) . Re - organization of actin protrusions at the leading edge of the cells 145 initiate cell migration 6 , 63 , therefore we further analyzed the significance of ERK3 in 146 cancer cell motility by loss of function studies . Depletion of ERK3 reduced speed and 147 displacement length ( distance between the start point and the end position of the cell 148 along each axis ) of MDA - MB231 cells ( Figure 1B - 1F and Supplementary Movie 1 - 149 4 ) . As shown in Figure 1C , depletion of ERK3 strongly reduced the random cell 150 motility , which remained low over time as indicated by the calculated acceleration 151 ( Figure 1D ) and concomitantly resulted in a shorter overall displacement length 152 ( Figure 1E ) with shorter migration track length and average speed ( Figure 1 - figure 153 supplement 1A and 1B ) . Considering that responses of tumor cells depend on their 154 microenvironment , we tested the in vivo motility of these cells . Intravital imaging of 155 6 the orthotopic mammary tumors confirmed reduced motility of the ERK3 knockdown 156 MDA - MB231 - GFP cells ( Figure 1G and Supplementary Movies 5 and 6 ) . Together , 157 these data suggest that ERK3 likely controls actin cytoskeleton dynamics thereby 158 influencing cell shape , motility and polarized migration . 159 ERK3 is activated and required for EGF - mediated directional migration in 160 epithelial cells 161 To further elucidate the physiological role of ERK3 in breast epithelial cell motility , 162 we assessed EGF - induced chemotactic responses to evaluate directional migratory 163 properties of control and ERK3 - depleted primary HMECs and metastatic MDA - 164 MB231 cells . Interestingly , knockdown of ERK3 significantly attenuated the EGF - 165 induced chemotaxis of both cell types ( Figure 1 - figure supplement 1C , 1D and 1E , 166 1F , respectively ) . 167 Considering that ERK3 participated in EGF - mediated chemotactic responses of both 168 primary and oncogenic mammary epithelial cells , we tested ERK3 protein kinetics in 169 response to the growth factor . EGF induced serine 189 ( S189 ) phosphorylation of 170 ERK3 at early time points in primary epithelial cells ( Figure 1 - figure supplement 2A 171 and 2B ) and MDA - MB231 cells ( Figure 1 - figure supplement 2C and 2D ) . A slight 172 increase in ERK3 protein levels was detected in HMECs upon EGF treatment ( Figure 173 1 - figure supplement 2A and 2B ) . Further cycloheximide ( CHX ) chase experiments 174 coupled with RT - PCR analyses suggested that EGF treatment did not increase ERK3 175 protein half - life ( Figure 1 - figure supplement 2E - 2H ) . Taken together , these data 176 confirmed that ERK3 was activated in response to EGF and required for EGF - 177 mediated directional migration of epithelial cells . We then investigated the 178 significance of S189 phosphorylation of ERK3 on F - actin and formation of actin rich 179 protrusions . ERK3 - depleted HMECs cells ( shERK3 - 3’UTR ) presented in Figure 1A 180 were transfected with V5 - tagged ERK3 wild type ( ERK3 WT ) or S189 mutants 181 ( ERK3 S189A / ERK3 S189D ) and expression of exogenous ERK3 was visualized by 182 V5 - tag staining . Co - staining of the cells with phalloidin green did not show any 183 significant differences in F - actin organization upon the overexpression of the S189 184 phosphorylation mutants as compared to the wild type ERK3 transfected cells ( Figure 185 1 - figure supplement 3 ) . Moreover , we observed that exogenous ER K3 localized 186 predominantly in the cytosol as compared to the endogenous ERK3 , where we could 187 detect ERK3 localizing at the cell edges and F - actin rich protrusions ( Figure 1A ) . 188 7 These results prompted us to prefer ERK3 knockdown cells for the study of ERK3 - 189 mediated phenotypes . 190 191 ERK3 is required for actin - rich protrusions 192 In order to migrate , cells acquire morphological asymmetry to drive their locomotion . 193 One of the first steps into breaking spatial symmetry of the cell involves its 194 polarization and formation of membrane extensions 15 . In response to extracellular 195 guidance , cells polarize and extend F - actin - rich protrusions at the leading edge to 196 direct cell migration 63 - 65 . As shown in Figure 1A , ERK3 co - localized with F - actin at 197 the edge of the cell and at the protruding filopodial spikes . Moreover , knockdown of 198 ERK3 clearly reduced F - actin content and actin - rich protrusions in human mammary 199 primary epithelial cells ( Figure 1A ) . Further analyses of control and ERK3 200 knockdown HMECs at the single - cell level confirmed that ERK3 - depleted cells had 201 limited , diffuse F - actin , concentrated in the cortical areas of the cells , and a 202 significantly decreased number of filopodia ( Figure 1G - 1J ) . 203 ERK3 - dependent regulation of Rac1 and Cdc42 activity 204 RhoGTPases are the major membrane signaling transmitters that drive polarized cell 205 asymmetry by locally regulating the formation of F - actin - rich protrusions 66 , 67 . EGF 206 signaling triggers activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 , which link the signal to the actin 207 cytoskeleton leading to the formation of lamellipodia - and filopodia - like protrusions , 208 respectively ( Figure 2A ) 68 . 209 Considering that loss of ERK3 significantly affected F - actin distribution and filopodia 210 formation in primary mammary epithelial cells ( Figure 1A and 1G - J ) , we tested the 211 activity of the two major regulators of actin assembly , Cdc42 and Rac1 ( Figure 2 B - 212 G ) . ERK3 knockdown significantly decreased levels of both basal and EGF - induced 213 GTP - bound Cdc42 and Rac1 in primary ( HMEC ) ( Figure 2B , D , F ) and triple 214 negative breast cancer ( MDA - MB231 ) mammary epithelial cells ( Figure 2C , E , G ) , 215 respectively . HMECs were cultured in the growth factor / hormone - enriched medium , 216 including EGF . Therefore , we withdrew the supplements to test the effect of EGF 217 alone on the activity of Rac1 and Cdc42 in these cells and compared the responses 218 with those of the cancer cells . Interestingly , we detected high Rac1 and Cdc42 levels 219 at steady state in HMEC cells , which underwent a rapid activation - inactivation cycle 220 after starvation and restimulation with EGF alone . The inhibitory effect on Rac1 was 221 8 not as striking as with Cdc42 ( Figure 2D - G ) . Intriguingly , we could observe co - 222 precipitation of ERK3 protein with the active RhoGTPases at endogenous levels 223 suggesting that these proteins exist in a multimeric complex ( Figure 2B - 2C ) . We 224 expanded these analyses to different cell types and consistently found that depletion 225 of ERK3 reduces the activity of Rac1 and Cdc42 and that the active RhoGTPases 226 specifically co - precipitated endogenous ERK3 ( Figure 2 - figure supplement 1 and 2 ) . 227 Interestingly , the effect of ERK3 on Rac1 and Cdc42 activity is either EGF - dependent 228 ( MCF7 cells ( Figure 2 - figure supplement 1A - 1C ) , Calu1 cells ( Figure 2 - figure 229 supplemnet 2A - 2C ) , – independent ( MDA - MB468 cells ( Figure 2 - figure supplement 230 1D - 1F ) or occurs both in resting and EGF - treated cells ( HT - 29 ( Figure 2 - figure 231 supplement 2D - 2F ) . Apart from cancer cells , we were also able to confirm that ERK3 232 sustains the activity of Rac1 and Cdc42 in primary human umbilical vein endothelial 233 cells , HUVECs ( Figure 2 - figure supplement 2G - 2I ) . 234 235 ERK3 directly binds to Rac1 and Cdc42 236 In light of these observations , we tested whether any direct interaction existed 237 between these RhoGTPases and ERK3 . By employing purified full - length 238 recombinant proteins , we found that ERK3 directly bound to Rac1 and Cdc42 in a 239 nucleotide - independent manner ( Figure 2H and 2I ) . The nucleotide - loading status of 240 the purified Rac1 and Cdc42 proteins was simultaneously assessed by GST - Pak1 - 241 PBD pull - down assay followed by immunoblots ( Figure 2 - figure supplement 3 ) . To 242 further assess the affinity of the binding , we performed concentration - dependent 243 protein binding assays with ELISA as described in the methods section . Binding of 244 full - length ERK3 to Rac1 and Cdc42 could be detected at a low nanomolar range ( 5 245 nM ) ( Figure 2J and 2K ) . Next , we tested whether the kinase domain of ERK3 ( amino 246 acids ( aa ) 9 - 327 ) would be sufficient for this interaction . In vitro GST - pull - down 247 assays confirmed that the kinase domain of ERK3 was sufficient for its binding to 248 Rac1 and Cdc42 ( Figure 2L , Figure 2 - figure supplement 4 ) . 249 250 ERK3 functions as a GEF for Cdc42 251 The intrinsic GDP - GTP exchange of RhoGTPases is a slow process , which is 252 stimulated in vivo by GEFs ( Figure 3A ) 44 . To examine the ability of the ERK3 kinase 253 domain to stimulate GDP - GTP exchange , we incubated GDP - loaded RhoGTPases 254 with non - hydrolysable GTPγS in the presence or absence of ERK3 kinase domain and 255 9 quantified the final amount of GTP - bound Cdc42 ( Figure 3B and 3C ) and Rac1 256 ( Figure 3D and 3E ) using GST - Pak1 - PBD fusion beads . The ERK3 kinase domain 257 failed to interact directly with the GST - Pak1 - PBD protein but bound to active Cdc42 258 in the same assay confirming that conformationally stable protein is being employed 259 in these assays ( Figure 2 - figure supplement 4 ) . These experiments showed that 260 although in cultured cells ERK3 regulated the activity of both Cdc42 and Rac1 , it 261 only directly stimulated the GDP - GTP exchange of Cdc42 ( Figure 3B and 3C ) . We 262 further corroborated these results by measuring GEF activity of the ERK3 kinase 263 domain in vitro by employing a second fluorophore - based assay . The results 264 confirmed those of the previous assay , as addition of ERK3 stimulated GTP - loading 265 on Cdc42 ( Figure 3F ) , but not on Rac1 ( Figure 3G ) . Notably , ERK3 exerted a more 266 potent and long - lasting effect than Dbl’s Big Sister ( Dbs ) , a well - established GEF for 267 Cdc42 and RhoA proteins ( Figure 3F ) 69 . 268 To assess whether full - length ERK3 could potentiate the effect in terms of activation 269 of Cdc42 , we compared GEF activity of the ERK3 kinase domain with that of the 270 full - length protein . Interestingly , full - length ERK3 exhibited weaker GEF activity in 271 vitro than the kinase domain of ERK3 ( Figure 3 - figure supplement 1 ) . The observed 272 in vitro discrepancy between the kinase domain and the full - length protein could be 273 attributed to differences in posttranslational modifications due to different production 274 methods of the two recombinant proteins , which might affect conformation and / or 275 activity . The full - length protein employed in these assays was purified from Sf9 cells , 276 while the kinase domain was purified from bacterial cells and therefore lacked – 277 among other things - Ser189 phosphorylation and thus kinase activity in vitro ( data 278 not shown , also see the methods section ) . We next examined whether ERK3 is 279 required for the localization and activity of Cdc42 at the plasma membrane ( PM ) . 280 Cellular fractionation assays revealed that knockdown of ERK3 does not disrupt the 281 localization of Cdc42 and Rac1 to the PM ( Figure 4A - 4C ) . On the contrary , the PM 282 fraction from ERK3 - depleted HMECs had more total Cdc42 and Rac1 than control 283 cells . Interestingly , subsequent pull - down of active Cdc42 / Rac1 from the PM fraction 284 revealed that although both RhoGTPAses are present at the plasma membrane in the 285 absence of ERK3 , their activity is significantly reduced ( Figure 4B and 4C ) . These 286 results were corroborated by the colocalization of ERK3 with Cdc42 to the 287 protrusions at the cell leading - edge ( Figure 4D - 4G ) with mean Pearson’s correlation 288 10 coeficient ( PCC ( r ) ) of 0 . 6638 ± 0 . 02946 and Spearman’s rank correlation coefficent 289 ( SRCC ( ρ ) ) : 0 . 7122 ± 0 . 02586 ( Figure 4F and 4G , respectively ) . 290 291 ERK3 as a nucleation - promoting factor of ARP2 / 3 - dependent actin 292 polymerization 293 Active Rac1 and Cdc42 induce ARP2 / 3 - dependent actin polymerization by activating 294 their effector NPFs , WASP and WAVE , respectively 17 , 18 . Figure 5A depicts a well - 295 described signaling module of ARP2 / 3 - dependent actin nucleation stimulated by 296 Cdc42 - activated WASP protein 17 , 40 , 70 - 72 . 297 As ERK3 protein co - precipitated with active Rac1 and Cdc42 ( Figure 2B and 2C ) we 298 further investigated whether also components of the ARP2 / 3 complex precipitate with 299 Rac1 / Cdc42 . Interestingly , we readily detected the ARP2 / 3 complex subunits ARP3 , 300 ARP2 and ARPC1A as well as ERK3 by immunoblots in active Rac1 / Cdc42 pull - 301 downs ( Figure 5B ) . Consistent with the reduction in active Rac1 and Cdc42 levels , we 302 observed that knockdown of ERK3 by CRISPR / Cas9 or with si / shRNAs led to a 303 reduction of F - actin staining in mammary epithelial cells as shown in Figure 5C and 304 Figure 5 - figure supplement 1A . To further quantify these effects and to corroborate 305 the role of ERK3 in polymerization of actin filaments , we evaluated the ratio of 306 cytoskeleton - incorporated filamentous ( F - ) and globular / monomeric actin ( G - actin ) in 307 control and ERK3 - depleted mammary epithelial cells by ultracentrifugation . 308 Knockdown of ERK3 significantly shifted total F - actin to G - actin in both primary 309 HMECs ( Figure 5D and 5E ) and MDA - MB231 cancer cells ( Figure 5 - figure 310 supplement 1B and 1C ) . Moreover , in the absence of Cdc42 , we could still detect 311 colocalization between endogenous ERK3 and the ARP3 subunit of the ARP2 / 3 312 complex ( Figure 5 - figure supplement 2A - 2D ) . These data prompted us to test whether 313 ERK3 directly controls ARP2 / 3 - dependent actin polymerization in the absence of 314 Rac1 and Cdc42 . 315 In vitro , the ARP2 / 3 complex expresses low intrinsic actin nucleating activity . In vivo , 316 its activity is tightly controlled by NPFs which stimulate conformational changes 73 , 74 . 317 To determine whether ERK3 had any direct effect on the assembly of actin filaments , 318 we used a pyrene - actin polymerization assay to monitor fluorescence kinetics over 319 time as the actin filaments assembled in the presence of the purified ARP2 / 3 complex . 320 11 We used the VCA domain of WASP protein as a positive control . Indeed , 321 recombinant ERK3 stimulated ARP2 / 3 - dependent actin polymerization at a 322 nanomolar concentration ( 5 nM ) in the presence of 10 nM of the ARP2 / 3 complex 323 ( Figure 5F ) . Moreover , the nucleation - promoting activity of ERK3 was comparable to 324 WASP ( VCA ) , a well - known NPF . ERK3 protein alone did not exert any stimulatory 325 effect on actin nucleation ( Figure 5F ) . These data suggest that ERK3 could function 326 as nucleation promoting factor to promote ARP2 / 3 - dependent actin polymerization . 327 Additionally , we tested what effect it had on ARP2 / 3 - dependent actin polymerization 328 when both ERK3 and WASP ( VCA ) were present . Using the same concentration as 329 for the initial screening ( ERK3 4 . 8 nM and WASP ( VCA ) at 400 nM ) , we did not 330 detect any additive effect when both proteins were combined ( Figure 5 - figure 331 supplement 3 ) . Combination of both proteins under this stoichiometric setting rather 332 negatively affected the polymerization rate that could be achieved by each protein 333 separately ( Figure 5 - figure supplement 3 ) . 334 335 ERK3 directly binds to ARP3 336 The ARP2 / 3 complex is composed of seven subunits : the actin - related proteins ARP2 337 and ARP3 and five associated proteins ( ARPC1 - 5 ) that sequester ARP2 and ARP3 in 338 the complex’s inactive conformation 35 , 38 ( Figure 6A ) . In vitro , NPFs such as WASP 339 stimulate actin polymerization by directly binding to and activating ARP2 / 3 . 340 Considering that ERK3 exerted a similar effect on the ARP2 / 3 - dependent actin 341 polymerization as NPFs , we further investigated the mode of interaction between 342 ERK3 and the ARP2 / 3 protein complex by employing purified components . Indeed , 343 using quantitative ELISAs we found that full - length ERK3 bound to the ARP2 / 3 344 complex with high affinity in vitro ( Figure 6B ) . 345 ARP2 and ARP3 are essential for the nucleating activity of the ARP2 / 3 complex and 346 occupy the central position in actin nucleation . Structural modeling has suggested that 347 although ARP2 and ARP3 interact with each other in the inactive conformation , they 348 are not not in the right configuration to act as a seed for actin nucleation . After 349 activation by NPF binding the heterodimer mimics two actin subunits . Binding of an 350 actin monomer then initiates the formation of the actin nucleus and the 351 polymerization process 73 , 75 , 76 . Extensive characterization of the individual subunits 352 also revealed that ARP3 is crucial for the stimulation and activity of the ARP2 / 3 353 complex and nucleation in vitro 75 . Considering that ARP3 is a structural component 354 12 regulating nucleating properties of the ARP2 / 3 complex , we further determined 355 whether ERK3 can directly bind to ARP3 . Through GST - pull - down experiments with 356 purified recombinant proteins , we could indeed detect a concentration - dependent 357 direct binding between full - length ERK3 and ARP3 ( Figure 6C ) . These results were 358 further confirmed with ELISA analyses suggesting a high affinity binding between 359 these two proteins ( Figure 6D ) . Finally , we also detected ERK3 co - precipitating with 360 ARP3 and ARP2 in human mammary epithelial cells at endogenous levels ( Figure 361 6E ) . 362 363 ERK3 phosphorylates ARP3 at S418 364 Conformational changes activating ARP2 / 3 are induced by binding to NPFs , actin and 365 ATP . Additionally , phosphorylation of the ARP2 / 3 residues has been reported 366 previously to play a crucial role in the conformational rearrangements within the 367 ARP2 / 3 complex 77 - 81 . Most of the studies focused on phosphorylation of the ARP2 368 subunit , which induced the conformational repositioning of this subunit towards 369 ARP3 , further allowing binding of NPFs and full - activation of the ARP2 / 3 complex 370 leading to the formation of the ARP2 - ARP3 heterodimer 79 - 81 . From the seven 371 components of the ARP2 / 3 complex ARP3 , ARP2 and ARPC1A purified from 372 Acanthamoeba castellani were shown to be phosphorylated 80 . Since ERK3 is a 373 kinase , we assessed phosphorylation of the ARP2 / 3 complex by ERK3 by employing 374 in vitro kinase assays and subsequent analysis of phosphopeptides by mass 375 spectrometry . Initial analyses detected phosphorylation of the ARP3 subunit at serine 376 418 ( S418 ) ( peptide sequence : HNPVFGVM S , please see supplementary file 1 ) . We 377 further validated the significance of the detected phosphorylation in vivo by 378 overexpressing the non - phosphorylatable ( S418A ) and phospho - mimicking ( S418D ) 379 mutants of ARP3 in primary mammary epithelial cells and analysing the cell 380 morphology and F - actin abundance . Cells transduced with wild - type ( WT ) ARP3 or 381 empty vector ( EV ) were used as reference controls ( Figure 6F ) . We were able to 382 validate the phosphorylation of the ARP3 at Ser418 in the the wild type ( EV ) as well 383 as the ARP3 - overexpressing cells ( Figure 6G ) and detect a decrease at the S418 384 phosphorylation in ERK3 - depleted cells depicted in Figure 5C ( Figure 6 - figure 385 supplement 1 ) . Of note , we observed that expression of exogenous ARP3 reduced the 386 protein levels of the endogenous ARP3 ( Figure 6G ) , possibly due to disruption of the 387 protein complex , thereby affecting the stability of the endogenous proteins . Strikingly , 388 13 expression of the phosphorylation - mimicking ARP3 mutant ( S418D ) under these 389 settings predominantly induced actin filament formation , as indicated by the intense 390 phalloidin staining ( Figure 6F ) and enhanced the F / G - actin ratio in primary mammary 391 epithelial cells ( Figure 6H and 6I ) . Moreover , S418D - overexpressing cells exhibited 392 F - actin - rich protrusions ( Figure 6F , lower panel ) . In contrast , most of the S418A - 393 expressing cells were smaller in size and had a round morphology ( Figure 6F , upper 394 panel ) . Quantification of the F - actin levels revealed that despite the morphological 395 distortion , cells expressing non - phosphorylatable ARP3 ( ARP3 S418A ) had no 396 significant effect on overall F - actin levels ( Figure 6H and 6I ) . To further determine 397 the relevance of the S418 phosphorylation in ERK3 - regulated ARP2 / 3 - dependent 398 actin polymerization in cells , we depleted ERK3 in the ARP3 S418D - overexpressing 399 HMECs using shRNA ( Figure 6J - 6L ) . Knockdown of ERK3 led to a significant 400 reduction of the F - actin levels in the ARP3 S418D - overexpressing cells . These data 401 suggested that although phosphorylation at Ser418 of ARP3 promoted actin 402 polymerization and thus the F - actin content it is not absolutely essential like ERK3 . A 403 concomitant active Rac1 / Cdc42 pull - down revealed a significant decrease in Rac1 404 activity , with almost no effect on Cdc42 ( Figure 6 - figure supplement 2A and 2B ) . We 405 could still detect ARP3 and ARP2 in complex with Cdc42 under these settings 406 ( Figure 6 - figure supplement 2A ) . Using immunofluorescence analysis , we observed 407 significant colocalization between endogenous ERK3 and ARP3 in HMECs ( Figure 408 6 - figure supplement 2C ) and between endogenous ERK3 and overexpressed ARP3 409 S418D ( Figure 6 - figure supplement 2D - 2F ) , respectively . Further , depletion of ERK3 , 410 as expected , reduced the migration of ARP3 S418D - expressing cells ( Figure 6 - figure 411 supplement 2G and 2H ) . 412 413 Kinase activity of ERK3 is necessary for membrane protrusions in primary 414 mammary epithelial cells 415 ERK3 controls both F - actin levels by regulation of the new filament assembly via 416 ARP3 - binding and its branching and bundling into the actin - rich protrusions by 417 binding to Cdc42 / Rac1 . We further investigated whether kinase activity of ERK3 was 418 required for the formation of actin - rich protrusions and F - actin levels in mammary 419 epithelial cells . Control ( shCo ) and ERK3 - depleted ( shERK3 , 3’UTR ) HMECs were 420 reconstituted with wildtype ( WT ) or kinase dead ( KD ) ( K49A / K50A ) ERK3 , and 421 empty vector ( EV ) was introduced as a control ( Figure 7A ) . Knockdown of ERK3 led 422 14 to a decrease in actin - rich protrusions and overall F - actin staining ( Figure 7B ) with 423 concomitant decrease in F - actin abundance ( Figure 7C and 7D ) . Complementation 424 with ERK3 WT rescued overall F - actin levels and the protrusive phenotype of the 425 HMECs ( Figure 7B , D ) . Interestingly , kinase - dead ERK3 recovered cytoskeletal F - 426 actin levels to the same extent as ERK3 WT ( Figure 7C and 7D ) . However , although 427 the abundance of F - actin is rescued upon kinase - dead ERK3 overexpression , cells 428 form dense meshwork of actin membrane ruffles which do not protrude into filopodia 429 but rather curved around the edges of the cell forming a tangled web ( Figure 7B ) . 430 These results indicate that kinase activity of ERK3 is not required for the 431 polymerization of actin , but rather for the bundling and / or branching of the rapidly 432 polymerizing actin filaments . To further corroborate these observations , the wild type 433 ( WT ) and kinase - dead ( KD ) ERK3 proteins were expressed in rabbit reticulocyte 434 lysate ( RRL ) system and then employed to stimulate ARP2 / 3 - dependent actin 435 polymerization in vitro . Kinase activity of ERK3 does not seeem to affect the 436 ARP2 / 3 - dependent actin polymerization in vitro ( Figure 7 - figure supplement 1 ) . We 437 performed active Rac1 / Cdc42 pull - down from HMECs shERK3 ( 3’ UTR ) cells 438 reconstituted with either wild - type ( WT ) or the kinase dead ( KD ) ERK3 and found 439 that the kinase activity of ERK3 was not required for interactions or activation of 440 Cdc42 . However , Rac1 activation was partially dependent on the kinase activity of 441 ERK3 ( Figure 7 - figure supplement 2A - 2E ) . 442 443 Discussion 444 The regulation of the actin cytoskeleton is an intensely investigated area because of its 445 fundamental role in many basic cellular functions . The signaling machinery that 446 controls the actin skeleton dynamics is deregulated in cancer contributing to 447 metastasis . Kinases are major drivers of signaling events and form the largest part of 448 the druggable genome . Several drugs have successfully been developed to target 449 deregulated kinases in cancer . Of the more than 500 kinases encoded by the human 450 genome many studies have been focused on the conventional MAPKs , while the 451 pathophysiological significance of atypical MAPKs remains underexplored . We have 452 recently demonstrated that ERK3 directly contributed to AP - 1 / c - Jun activation , IL - 8 453 production and chemotaxis 52 . Emerging studies have further shown that ERK3 454 functions in a context - and tissue - specific manner in controlling tumourigenesis and 455 metastasis 50 , 51 , 53 , 56 , 81 , 88 , 89 . Mice expressing a catalytically inactive ERK3 mutant 456 15 survive to adulthood and are fertile , but the kinase activity of ERK3 is necessary for 457 optimal postnatal growth . In the present study , we aimed to elucidate how ERK3 458 influences cell shape and actin cytoskeleton and unexpectedly revealed a pivotal role 459 for this atypical MAPK in the regulation of RhoGTPases as GEF , of ARP2 / 3 - 460 dependent polymerization of actin probably as NPF and of cell migration in 461 mammalian cells . Further , our studies unveiled an evolutionarily conserved role for 462 ERK3 in the formation of actin - rich protrusions . 463 464 ERK3 is a GEF for Cdc42 . 465 The activation of both Rac1 and Cdc42 was compromised in the absence of ERK3 in 466 primary mammary epithelial cells and oncogenic MDA - MB - 231 cells . While the 467 activation of Rac1 was partially rescued in human mammary epithelial cells upon 468 EGF stimulation in ERK3 - depleted cells , this was not the case in MDA - MB231 cells 469 ( Figure 2B , 2C and 2F , 2G ) . Furthermore , while ERK3 regulated the activity of both 470 Rac1 and Cdc42 in vivo ( Figure 2B - 2G ) , the kinase domain of ERK3 , which lacks 471 kinase activity directly facilitated GDP - GTP nucleotide exchange specifically for 472 Cdc42 ( Figure 3B , 3C and 3G ) , which is implicated as a main regulator of filopodia 473 assembly . In some cell types , we often detect a reduction in the total protein levels of 474 Rac1 and Cdc42 after depletion of ERK3 . Whether inactivation of these RhoGTPases 475 prompt them for proteasomal degradation under these settings deserves further 476 analysis . Using several experimental procedures , we demonstrated that interaction 477 between ERK3 and Rac1 or Cdc42 is direct and nucleotide - independent which 478 suggests that ERK3 is probably targeting the C - terminus of these RhoGTPases . 479 Interestingly , it has been reported that Rac1 possesses a C - terminal docking ( D site ) 480 for the canonical ERK ( 183 KKRKRKCLLL 192 ) 45 . Whether the same site is being 481 exploited by EKR3 for its binding to Rac1 or Cdc42 deserves further studies . It is 482 interesting to note that while the kinase domain of ERK3 promoted GTP binding to 483 Cdc42 , it slightly attenuated the same process with Rac1 ( Figure 3B - 3G ) . While the 484 kinase activity of ERK3 is not required for Cdc42 activation , Rac1 activity partially 485 depends on it . Further structural , biochemical and biophysical studies are clearly 486 warranted to unveil the molecular basis of this interaction and the subsequent 487 functional implications . 488 In cells , regulation of RhoGTPases and that of the actin assembly is a much more 489 complex and integrative process 68 . For example , a cell type - dependent , hierarchical 490 16 crosstalk between RhoGTPases was observed in the regulation of actin - rich 491 protrusions and Cdc42 activity was shown to initiate Rac1 - dependent lamellipodia 492 protrusions 67 , 90 , 91 . While ERK3 might activate Rac1 through its GEF - like function of 493 Cdc42 , it could also function as an intermediate link between Rac1 and its GEF by 494 scaffolding both proteins and / or activating the GEF , thus indirectly contributing to 495 Rac1 activity . 496 497 It is highly interesting that PAK family kinases , the effector kinases of Rac1 and 498 Cdc42 , directly phosphorylate the SEG motif in the activation loop of ERK3 60 , 61 . The 499 observations presented here strongly suggest a positive feed - back loop , where ERK3 500 is required for the GTP loading of Cdc42 and Rac1 to induce their interaction with 501 PAKs which in turn phosphorylate and activate ERK3 and we show that active ERK3 502 kinase is required for eventual formation of actin - regulated membrane protrusions . 503 The functional and physical uncoupling of this loop could possibly be controlled by a 504 phosphatase or by inducing the rapid turn - over of ERK3 protein . The constituents of 505 this dynamic complex need further evaluation and characterization . 506 507 ERK3 binds ARP3 to regulate its function in actin polymerization . 508 Cells rely on several mechanisms to regulate the assembly of actin filaments . To 509 complicate matters further , regulatory pathways involved in the filopodia formation 510 seem to be cell - type specific and Cdc42 - , WASP - and ARP2 / 3 - independent 511 mechanisms of membrane spikes formation have been proposed 92 - 94 . In this study , we 512 demonstrate that ERK3 directly binds the ARP2 / 3 complex and contributes to actin 513 polymerization ( Figure 5 and 6 ) . Conformational changes in ARP2 / 3 complex 514 assembly are crucial for the initial heterodimer formation between ARP2 and ARP3 515 subunits 42 , 75 , 95 . In the unstimulated complex , ARP2 and ARP3 subunits exist in the 516 splayed confromation and upon stimulation by NPFs the two proteins align into a 517 side - by - side position creating a surface mimicking the first two subunits of the new 518 actin filament 35 , 96 . Binding of these two crucial subunits by NPFs could reassure an 519 active conformation . Interestingly , phosphorylation of certain subunits of ARP2 / 3 520 complex has been shown to be indispensable for the destabilization of its inactive 521 conformation prior the full activation by the NPFs 77 , 79 - 81 . LeClaire et al . , further 522 reported that Nck - interacting kinase ( NIK ) regulates ARP2 phosphorylation and 523 grooms ARP2 / 3 complex for the NPFs activation . Phosphorylation events within the 524 17 ARP2 / 3 complex could regulate nucleation activity by affecting several properties , 525 such as complex formation itself , conformational changes in the complex assembly or 526 the affinity of the ARP2 / 3 to NPFs . Further structural simulation studies are needed to 527 test if the interaction of ERK3 with ARP2 / 3 complex and the ARP3 phosphorylation 528 at S418 inflict key conformation changes to support actin polymerization . While we 529 uncover a role for ERK3 in the formation of filopodia and ARP2 / 3 - dependent actin 530 polymerization , the possible role for ERK3 in the regulation of other actin nucleation 531 factors including formins cannot be ruled out . 532 533 While the kinase activity of ERK3 is clearly required for the formation of actin - rich 534 protrusions , expression of kinase - dead constructs in ERK3 - depleted cells failed to 535 inhibit F - actin enrichment . These data suggest that perhaps ERK3 binding to ARP2 / 3 536 and possibly other hitherto unknown factors per se contributes to actin 537 polymerization , while its kinase activity is probably still required for ARP2 / 3 - 538 dependent and Cdc42 - induced filopodia formation , polarization and migration of 539 mammalian epithelial cells . 540 Overall , our studies shed new light on the multi - layered regulation of actin 541 cytoskeleton by an understudied MAPK . ERK3 is druggable and kinase inhibitors 542 have already been developed for clinical use , which could also serve as a tool to 543 decipher kinase - dependent and - independent functions . These observations will not 544 only enhance the current understanding of actin cytoskeleton regulation , but also 545 instigate new lines of investigations on the molecular , structural and functional 546 characterization of RhoGTPases and the ARP2 / 3 complex . 547 Material and methods 548 Cell culture 549 Immortalized Human mammary epithelial cells ( HMECs ) hTERT - HME1 ( ME16C ) 550 ( ATCC CRL - 4010 ) were purchased from ATCC ( Manassas , VA 20108 USA ) and 551 cultured in mammary epithelial cell growth medium ( MEGM ) BulletKit , containing 552 supplements and growth factors ( Cat # CC - 3150 , Lonza ) according to the Clonetics ® 553 mammary epithelial cell system quide ( Lonza ) .

The images were first 1025 acquired in multiple regions of each cell type for 20 h . 1026 The image sequences were imported into Imaris version 9 . 3 . 1 and detected 1027 automatically by fluorescence with both the whole - cell spot and whole - cell surface 1028 analysis . As the surface and spot analysis center positions differed in control analysis 1029 by less than 1 % , the whole cell spot automated analysis was applied to all images in 1030 the same way with a 16 µm per cell diameter estimate . The automated tracking also 1031 occurred in the same way for all image sequences within Imaris with the 1032 autoregressive motion algorithm , with a maximum average distance of 60 µm per step 1033 and with zero step gap applied . The speed ( or cell speed ) was determined by dividing 1034 each x , y step by 1800 seconds ( or 30 minutes ) . The acceleration ( or cell acceleration ) 1035 33 was determined by subtracting a step speed from the previous step speed and dividing 1036 by 1800 seconds ( or 30 minutes ) . The displacement length was determined by 1037 subtracting the initial x , y position from the final x , y position and then to determine 1038 the difference vector length for each track over 20 hours of acquisition . The track 1039 length added each absolute x , y vector step for an entire track over 20 hours of 1040 acquisition . The track mean speed averaged the speed of the steps for individual 1041 tracks . 1042 The graphs were created with GraphPad Prism ( RRID : SCR _ 002798 ) and cell 1043 distribution according to the analyzed parameter was visualized by violin plots . 1044 Significance was determined using non - parametric Mann - Whitney test . 1045 1046 Transwell cell migration assay 1047 Migratory properties of control and ERK3 - depleted HMECs and MDA - MB231 cells 1048 were assessed using two - chamber transwell system ( Cat # 3422 , Corning ) .

After 1 h 1081 of continuous shaking , the supernatant was collected and transferred to a new tube 1082 containing freshly washed TiO2 beads for a second incubation . The TiO2 beads were 1083 collected separately and gently washed with 200 μL of loading buffer , 200 μL 80 % 1084 acetonitrile / 2 % trifluoroacetic acid , 200 mM ammonium glutamate , and 200 μL of 50 1085 % acetonitrile / 1 % trifluoroacetic acid , respectively . The TiO2 beads were dried and 1086 bound peptides were eluted sequentially in 10 minutes at first with 50 μL of 10 % 1087 ammonium hydroxide , pH 11 . 7 , then with 50 μL of 15 % ammonium hydroxide / 60 % 1088 acetonitrile , and finally with 50 μL of 1 % pyrrolidine . Eluted peptides were acidified 1089 by adding 75 μL 50 % formic acid and cleaned up using OMIX C18 , 10 µl SPE tips 1090 ( Agilent , Santa Clara , CA , USA ) . 1091 1092 LC - MS analysis : 1093 The samples were solved in 10 µl 0 . 1 % formic acid and 5 µl was analyzed by LC - MS 1094 using a timsTOF Pro ( Bruker Daltonik , Bremen , Germany ) which was coupled online 1095 to a nanoElute nanoflow liquid chromatography system ( Bruker Daltonik , Bremen , 1096 Germany ) via a CaptiveSpray nanoelectrospray ion source . The peptides were 1097 separated on a reversed phase C18 column ( 25 cm x 75 µm , 1 . 6 µm , IonOpticks 1098 ( Fitzroy , VIC , Australia ) ) . Mobile phase A contained water with 0 . 1 % ( vol / vol ) 1099 formic acid , and acetonitrile with 0 . 1 % ( vol / vol ) formic acid was used as mobile 1100 phase B .

ERK3 acts as a nucleation - promoting factor ( NPF ) in ARP2 / 3 - 1256 dependent actin polymerization in vitro and in vivo . ( A ) Schematic overview of 1257 Cdc42 - WASP stimulated ARP2 / 3 - dependent actin polymerization based on the cited 1258 literature . The process involves : ARP2 / 3 complex , WASP ( VCA ) as nucleation 1259 promoting factor , filamentous actin ( F - actin ) and monomeric actin ( G - actin ) . In the 1260 initial step Cdc42 is activated by GEF - catalyzed exchange of GDP to GTP . Active 1261 Cdc42 ( Cdc42 - GTP ) binds to the GTP - binding domain ( GBD ) on WASP thereby 1262 displacing the VCA domain . While the V - verpolin - like motif binds actin monomer 1263 ( G - actin ) , C - central and A - acidic domains bind and activate the ARP2 / 3 complex . 1264 Conformational changes induced by the binding of the ARP2 / 3 complex promote its 1265 40 binding to the actin filament , which is strengthened by the additional interaction of 1266 the ARP2 / 3 complex with WASP ( VCA ) - G - actin . Further conformational changes 1267 will secure the ARP2 / 3 complex on the filament and allow its binding to the actin 1268 monomer and the polymerization of the newly nucleated filament . Actin polymerizes 1269 at the fast - growing / barbed end , elongating towards the plasma membrane and the 1270 ARP2 / 3 complex would cross - link newly polymerizing filament to the existing 1271 filament .
