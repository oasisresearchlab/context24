Young † INTRODUCTION : Mammaliangenesthatplay prominent roles in healthy and diseasedcellular states are often controlled by special DNA el - ements called super - enhancers ( SEs ) . SEs are clusters of enhancers that are occupied by an unusually high density of interacting factors and drive higher levels of transcription than most typical enhancers . This high - density as - sembly at SEs has been shown to exhibit sharp transitionsofformationanddissolution , form - ing in a single nucleation event and collapsing when chromatin factors or nucleation sites are deleted . These features led usto postulate that SEs are phase - separated multimolecular as - semblies , also known as biomolecular conden - sates . Phase - separatedcondensates , suchasthe nucleolus and other membraneless cellular bodies , provideameanstocompartmentalizeand concentrate biochemical reactions within cells . RATIONALE : SEs are formed by the binding of master transcription factors ( TFs ) at each component enhancer , and these recruit un - usually high densities of coactivators , includ - ing Mediator and BRD4 . Mediator is a large ( ~ 1 . 2 MDa ) multisubunit complex that has mul - tiple roles in transcription , including bridging interactions between TFs and RNA polymerase II ( RNA Pol II ) . BRD4 facilitates the release of RNA Pol II molecules from the site of tran - scription initiation . The presence of MED1 , a subunit of Mediator , and BRD4 can be used to define SEs . We reasoned that if transcrip - tional condensates are formed at SEs , then MED1 and BRD4 should be visualized as dis - crete bodies at SE elements in cell nuclei . These bodies should exhibit behaviors described for liquid - like condensates . We investigated these possibilities by using murine embryonic stem cells ( mESCs ) , in which SEs were originally de - scribed . Because intrinsically disordered regions ( IDRs ) of proteins have been implicated in condensate formation , we postulated that the large IDRs present in MED1 and BRD4 might be involved . RESULTS : We found that MED1 and BRD4 occupy discrete nuclear bodies that occur at SEs in mESCs . These bodies exhibit properties of other well - studied biomolecular conden - sates , including rapid re - covery of fluorescence after photobleaching and sen - sitivity to 1 , 6 - hexanediol , which disrupts liquid - like condensates . Disruption of MED1 and BRD4 bodies by 1 , 6 - hexanediol was accompanied by a loss of chromatin - bound MED1 and BRD4 at SEs , as well as a loss of RNA Pol II at SEs and SE - driven genes . The IDRs of both MED1 and BRD4 formed phase - separated liquid droplets in vitro , and these droplets exhibited features characteristic of condensates formed by net - works of weak protein - protein interactions . The MED1 - IDR droplets were found to concentrate BRD4 and RNA Pol II from transcriptionally competent nuclear extracts , which may reflect their contribution to compartmentalizing and concentrating biochemical reactions associated with transcription at SEs in cells . CONCLUSION : Our results show that coacti - vators form phase - separated condensates at SEs and that SE condensates compartmentalize and concentrate the transcription apparatus at key cell - identity genes . These results have im - plications for the mechanisms involved in the control of genes in healthy and diseased cell states . We suggest that SE condensates facilitate the compartmentalization and concentration of transcriptional components at specific genes through the phase - separating properties of IDRs in TFs and cofactors . SE condensates may thus ensure robust transcription of genes essential to cell - identity maintenance . These properties may also explain why cancer cells acquire large SEs at driver oncogenes and why SEs that facilitate transcriptional dysregula - tion in disease can be especially sensitive to transcriptional inhibitors . ▪ RESEARCH Sabari et al . , Science 361 , 379 ( 2018 ) 27 July 2018 1 of 1 The list of author affiliations is available in the full article online . * These authors contributed equally to this work . † Corresponding author .

Young 1 , 3 † Super - enhancers ( SEs ) are clusters of enhancers that cooperatively assemble a high density of the transcriptional apparatus to drive robust expression of genes with prominent roles in cell identity . Here we demonstrate that the SE - enriched transcriptional coactivators BRD4 and MED1 form nuclear puncta at SEs that exhibit properties of liquid - like condensates and are disrupted by chemicals that perturb condensates . The intrinsically disordered regions ( IDRs ) of BRD4 and MED1 can form phase - separated droplets , and MED1 - IDR droplets can compartmentalize and concentrate the transcription apparatus from nuclear extracts . These results support the idea that coactivators form phase - separated condensates at SEs that compartmentalize and concentratethe transcriptionapparatus , suggest a role forcoactivator IDRs in this process , and offer insights into mechanisms involved in the control of key cell - identity genes . P haseseparationoffluidsisaphysicochemicalprocessbywhichmoleculesseparateintoadensephaseandadilutephase . Phase - separatedbiomolecularcondensates , which include the nucleolus , nuclear speckles , stress granules , and others , provide a mecha - nism to compartmentalize and concentrate bio - chemicalreactionswithincells ( 1 – 3 ) . Biomolecular condensates produced by liquid - liquid phase separation allow rapid movement of compo - nents into and within the dense phase and ex - hibit properties of liquid droplets such as fusion and fission ( 4 ) . Dynamic and cooperative multi - valent interactions among molecules , such as thoseproducedbycertainintrinsicallydisorderedregions ( IDRs ) of proteins , have been implicated in liquid - liquid phase separation ( 5 – 7 ) . Enhancers are gene regulatory elements bound by transcription factors ( TFs ) and other compo - nents of the transcription apparatus that func - tion to regulate expression of cell type – specific genes ( 8 – 13 ) . Super - enhancers ( SEs ) — clusters of enhancers that are occupied by exceptionally high densities of transcriptional machinery — regulate genes with especially important roles in cell identity ( 14 , 15 ) . DNA interaction data show that enhancer elements in the clusters are in close spatial proximity with each other and the promoters of the genes that they regulate ( 16 – 18 ) , consistent with the notion of a dense assembly of transcriptional machinery at these sites . This high - density assembly at SEs has been shown to exhibit sharp transitions of formation and dissolution , forming as the consequence of a single nucleation event ( 19 , 20 ) and collapsing when concentrated factors are depleted from chromatin ( 21 – 25 ) or when nucleation sites are deleted ( 26 – 29 ) . These properties of SEs led to the proposal that the high - density assembly of biomolecules at active SEs is due to phase sep - aration of enriched factors at these genetic el - ements ( 30 ) . Here we provide experimental evidence that the transcriptional coactivators BRD4 and MED1 ( a subunit of the Mediator complex ) form condensates at SEs . This estab - lishes a new framework to account for the diverse properties described for these regulatory ele - ments and expands the known biochemical pro - cesses regulated by phase separation to include the control of cell - identity genes . BRD4 and MED1 coactivators form nuclear puncta The enhancer clusters that make up SEs are oc - cupied by master TFs and unusually high den - sities of factors , including BRD4 and MED1 , that are coactivators ( 31 – 35 ) whose presence can be used to define SEs ( 14 , 15 , 21 ) . We reasoned that if BRD4 and MED1 are components of nuclear condensates , then they might be visualized as discrete puncta in the nuclei of cells , and the properties of these puncta could be investigated . Fixed cell immunofluorescence ( IF ) with anti - bodies against BRD4 and MED1 in murine em - bryonic stem cells ( mESCs ) revealed nuclear puncta for both factors ( Fig . 1A ) . To determine whether such puncta occur in live cells , we en - gineered mESCs by using CRISPR - Cas9 to tag endogenous BRD4 and MED1 with monomeric enhanced green fluorescent protein ( mEGFP ) ( fig . S1 ) . Live - cell fluorescence microscopy of the engineered mESC lines also revealed discrete nuclear puncta ( Fig . 1B ) . Analysis of these images showed that there were 1034 ± 130 BRD4 and 983 ± 102 MED1 puncta per nucleus ( means ± SEM ) ( table S1 ) . These results demonstrate that BRD4 and MED1 are components of puncta within the nuclei of mESCs . SEs are associated with coactivator puncta Several lines of evidence suggest that SEs are likely to be associated with some of the BRD4 and MED1punctain mESCs . ChIP - seq ( chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing ) data for BRD4 and MED1 show that SEs are especially enriched in these coactivators ( 14 , 15 ) . DNAinteractiondatasuggestthatSEconstituentsoccupiedbyBRD4andMED1areinclosespatialproximitytooneanother ( Fig . 1C and fig . S2A ) . Co - occupancy of the genome by BRD4 and MED1 is most evident at SEs ( fig . S2B ) ( 14 , 15 ) . To de - termine whether SEs are associated with some of the BRD4 and MED1 puncta , we performed IF for BRD4 or MED1 together with DNA - FISH or nascent RNA - FISH for the genomic region containing the Nanog gene and its SEs ( FISH , fluorescence in situ hybridization ) ( Fig . 1 , D to G ) . We found that BRD4 and MED1 puncta con - sistently overlapped the DNA - FISH foci ( Fig . 1D ) or RNA - FISH foci ( Fig . 1F ) . An average image analysis ( details are given in the methods ) of the BRD4 and MED1 IF signals centered at DNA - FISH foci ( n = 137 for BRD4 and 125 for MED1 ) and RNA - FISH foci ( n = 121 for BRD4 and 181 for MED1 ) revealed that , on average , BRD4 and MED1 fluorescence intensities are most enriched at the center of FISH foci ( Fig . 1 , E and G ) ; this trend was not observed for average images cen - tered at randomly selected nuclear positions ( Fig . 1 , E and G ) .

These results in - dicate that both BRD4 and MED1 puncta are present at SEs . Coactivator puncta exhibit liquid - like rates of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching We next sought to examine whether BRD4 and MED1 puncta exhibit features characteristic of liquid - like condensates . A hallmark of liquid - like condensates is internal dynamical reorganization and rapid exchange kinetics ( 1 – 3 ) , which can be interrogated by measuring the rate of fluores - cence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) . To study the dynamics of BRD4 and MED1 foci in live cells , we performed FRAP experiments on endogenously tagged mEGFP - BRD4 or mEGFP - MED1 cell lines . After photobleaching , mEGFP - BRD4 and mEGFP - MED1 puncta recovered fluorescence on a time scale of seconds ( Fig . 2 , A to D ) , with apparent diffusion coefficients of ~ 0 . 37 ± 0 . 13 and ~ 0 . 14 ± 0 . 04 m m 2 / s , respectively . These values are similar to those previously re - portedforcomponentsofliquid - likecondensates ( 36 , 37 ) . Adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) has been implicated in promoting condensate fluidity by driving energy - dependent processes and / or through its intrinsic hydrotrope activity ( 38 , 39 ) . Depletion of cellular ATP by glucose depriva - tion and oligomycin treatment altered fluores - cence recovery after photobleaching for both mEGFP - BRD4andmEGFP - MED1 foci ; therateof recovery for MED1 was reduced , and the extent of recovery for BRD4 was diminished ( Fig . 2 , E to H ) . These results indicate that puncta contain - ing BRD4 and MED1 have liquid - like properties in cells , consistent with previously described phase - separated condensates . Coactivator puncta and SE occupancy are sensitive to condensate perturbation To further investigate the biophysical properties of BRD4and MED1 puncta , we investigated their sensitivity to 1 , 6 - hexanediol , a compound known to disrupt liquid - like condensates , possibly by disruption of hydrophobic interactions ( 40 ) .

RESEARCH | RESEARCH ARTICLE with 1 , 6 - hexanediol caused a reduction in the number of BRD4 and MED1 puncta ( Fig . 3 , A and B ) . To determine the effect of 1 , 6 - hexanediol on BRD4 , MED1 , andRNApolymeraseII ( RNAPolII ) occupancy at enhancers and genes , ChIP - seq was performed with antibodies against these proteins in untreated or 1 , 6 - hexanediol – treated mESCs . Treatment with 1 , 6 - hexanediol caused a reduc - tion in all three proteins at enhancers , with the most profound effects occurring at SEs ( Fig . 3 , C and D , and fig . S5A ) . For example , at the Klf4 SE , the levels of BRD4 were reduced by 44 % , those of MED1 by 80 % , and those of RNA Pol II by 56 % ( Fig . 3C ) . Similar effects were observed genome - wide , wherereductions in BRD4 , MED1 , and RNA Pol II were substantially larger at SEs than at typical enhancers ( Fig . 3D ) , and the degrees to which BRD4 and MED1 were lost from SEs were positively correlated ( fig . S5B ) . These results are consistent withthe notionthat BRD4 and MED1 form condensates at SEs that are sensitive to 1 , 6 - hexanediol . The level of RNA Pol II occupancy across gene bodiescanbeusedasameasureoftranscriptionaloutput ( 41 ) . The ChIP - seq data revealed that the reduction in BRD4 and MED1 occupancy at SEs wasassociatedwithalossofRNAPolIIoccupancyacrossSE - associated gene bodies ( Fig . 3 , C and E , and fig . S5A ) . When genes were ranked by the extent to which RNA Pol II was lost upon 1 , 6 - hexanediol treatment , SE - associated genes were highly enriched among those that lost the most RNA Pol II ( Fig . 3F ) . These results are consistent with the idea that BRD4 and MED1 condensates are associated with SEs and that loss of condensate integrity adversely affects transcription . IDRs of BRD4 and MED1 phase - separate in vitro BRD4 and MED1 contain large IDRs ( Fig . 4A ) and share features with the IDRs of several pro - teins known to facilitate condensate formation ( 2 , 3 ) , including high proline and glutamine con - tent ( BRD4 ) , high serine content ( MED1 ) , and acidic and basic regions ( BRD4 and MED1 ) .

As determined by aspect ratio analysis , the MED1 - IDR and BRD4 - IDR droplets were highly spherical ( fig . S6A ) , a property expected for liquid - like droplets ( 1 – 3 ) . Phase - separated droplets typically scale in size according to the concentration of components in the system ( 43 ) . We performed the droplet forma - tion assay with varying concentrations of BRD4 - IDR , MED1 - IDR , andmEGFP , rangingfrom0 . 625 to20 m M .

Althoughthesedroplets were smaller at lower concentrations , we observed BRD4 - IDR and MED1 - IDR droplets at the lowest concentration tested ( 0 . 625 m M ) ( fig . S6C ) . To investigate the biophysical properties of these droplets , we tested their ability to form under varying salt concentrations ( to probe the contributionofelectrostaticinteractions ) orupon 1 , 6 - hexanediol treatment ( to probe the contribu - tion of hydrophobic interactions ) . The size dis - tributions of both BRD4 - IDR and MED1 - IDR droplets shifted toward smaller droplets with in - creasingNaClconcentration ( from50 to350mM ) ( Fig . 4E and fig .

These results demonstrate that a variety of mo - lecular interactions contribute to BRD4 - IDR and MED1 - IDR droplet formation .

The preformed BRD4 - IDR and MED1 - IDR droplets were reduced insizeandnumberwithdilutionandevenfurtherreducedwithelevatedsaltconcentration ( Fig . 4F and fig . S7B ) . These results show that the BRD4 - IDR and MED1 - IDR droplets form a distribution of sizes that is dependent on the conditions of the system and , once formed , respond to changes in the system , with rapid adjustments in size . These featuresarecharacteristic of phase - separated con - densates formed by networks of weak protein - protein interactions ( 1 – 3 ) . MED1 - IDR participates in liquid - liquid phase separation in cells To investigate whether the coactivator IDRs facilitate phase separation in cells , we used a pre - viously developed assay to manipulate local pro - tein concentrations within the cell ; this optoIDR assay tests IDR - dependent , light - inducible drop - let formation in vivo ( 44 ) . Briefly , the photo - activatable , self - associating Cry2 protein was labeled with mCherry and fused to an IDR of interest . This fusion mediates a blue light – inducible increase in the local concentration of selected IDRs within the cell ( Fig . 5A ) ( 44 ) . In this assay , IDRs known to promote phase separation enhance the photoresponsive cluster - ing properties of Cry2 ( 45 , 46 ) , causing rapid formation of liquid - like spherical droplets under stimulation by blue light . Fusion of a portion of the MED1 - IDR to Cry2 - mCherry facilitated the rapid formation of micron - sized spherical drop - lets upon blue light stimulation ( optoDroplets ) ( Fig . 5 , B and C , and fig . S8 ) . During stimula - tion , proximal droplets were observed to fuse ( Fig . 5 , D and E , and Movie 4 ) . The fusions ex - hibitedcharacteristicliquid - likefusionproperties of necking and relaxation to sphericalshape ( Fig . 5E ) . The MED1 - IDR droplets persisted after blue light stimulation and exhibited liquid - like FRAP recovery rates in the absence of blue light stim - ulation ( Fig . 5 , F to H ) . The rapid FRAP kinetics in the absence of light - activated Cry2 interac - tions suggests that the MED1 - IDR optoDroplets established by blue light are dynamic assemblies exchanging with the dilute phase . Conserved serine bias in the MED1 - IDR is necessary for phase separation Previous studies have implicated low - complexity IDRs of proteins in liquid - liquid phase separa - tion ( 7 , 36 , 37 , 42 ) . An examination of the amino acid content of MED1 revealed that the IDR con - tains a compositional bias for serine ( Fig . 6A ) . Thisserinecompositionalbiasisconservedamongvertebrates ( Fig . 6B ) . To investigate whether the serine bias is necessary for the MED1 - IDR ’ s capacity to phase - separate , we mutated all the serine ( S ) residues to alanine ( A ) and investigated the ability of this mutated IDR to form phase - separated droplets in vitro . The MED1 - IDR S - to - A mutantwasincapableofformingphase - separated droplets under conditions in which the wild - type IDR readily formed droplets ( Fig . 6C ) , indicating thattheconserved serine bias in the MED1 - IDRis necessary for droplet formation . MED1 - IDR droplets can incorporate proteins necessary for transcription A proposedfunctionofphaseseparationatSEsis the ability to compartmentalize and concentrate factors within a biomolecular condensate , so we soughtto test whether MED1 - IDR droplets could recapitulate this compartmentalization function invitro . Weidentifiedconditionsunder whichthe MED1 - IDR could form droplets but the BRD4 - IDR could not ( fig . S9 ) . We then investigated whether the MED1 - IDR droplets could compartmentalize BRD4 - IDRproteinundertheseconditions ( Fig . 7A ) . Using differentially labeled proteins ( mCherry – MED1 - IDR and mEGFP – BRD4 - IDR ) , we found that the MED1 - IDR droplets could incorporate , and thus concentrate , the BRD4 - IDR protein ( Fig . 7A ) . The MED1 - IDR droplets did not in - corporate mEGFP ( Fig . 7A ) . To probe the ap - proximate mesh size of the MED1 - IDR droplets ( 47 ) , we incubated them withfluorescentlylabeled dextrans with average molecular weights of 4 , 10 , and 40 kDa . We found that the 4 - kDa dextrans were incorporated into the MED1 - IDR droplets , the 10 - kDa dextrans were incorporated with less efficiency , andthe40 - kDadextranswereexcluded ( fig . S10 ) . These results suggest that the incor - porationofmEGFP – BRD4 - IDR ( 105kDa ) intothe MED1 - IDR droplet is due to attractive molecular interactions , as opposed to passive diffusion through the droplet mesh . We next investigated whether the MED1 - IDR , introducedintoatranscription - competentnuclear extract , would form droplets that might incor - porate BRD4 or other transcriptional compo - nents . We found that the wild - type MED1 - IDR , but not the MED1 - IDR S - to - A mutant , formed dropletsintheseextracts ( Fig . 7B ) . TheMED1 - IDR phase - separated droplets were denser than the surrounding extract and thus could be purified from solution by centrifugation . Immunoblot analysis revealed that BRD4 and the largest sub - unit of RNA Pol II ( RPB1 ) were enriched in pel - leted droplets in a MED1 - IDR dose – dependent manner ( Fig . 7C ) . These results indicate that the MED1 - IDR droplets can incorporate BRD4 and RNA Pol II . The ability of the MED1 - IDR protein to in - corporate BRD4 and RNA Pol II into an artificial phase - separated compartment suggests that it sequesters key components of the transcription apparatus and might thus “ squelch ” transcription in the nuclear extract . Wecarried out an in vitro transcriptionassaywiththeseextractsandfoundthatthewild - type MED1 - IDR protein doessquelch transcription , correlating with the amount of material separated from solution by the MED1 - IDR droplets ( Fig . 7D ) . We didnotobservethese effects with equivalent concentrations of mEGFP or with the MED1 - IDR S - to - A mutant ( Fig . 7D ) . These results demonstrate that the MED1 - IDR has the capacity to compartmentalize and con - centrate transcriptional machinery from a com - plex nuclear extract . Discussion SEsregulategeneswithprominentrolesinhealthyanddiseasedcellularstates ( 14 , 15 , 19 – 25 , 48 , 49 ) . SEs and their components have been proposed to form phase - separated condensates ( 30 ) , but with no direct evidence .

RESEARCH | RESEARCH ARTICLE transcription . Within these condensates , BRD4 andMED1 exhibitapparentdiffusioncoefficients similar to those previously reported for other proteins in phase - separated condensates in vivo ( 36 , 37 ) . The IDRs of both BRD4 and MED1 are sufficienttoformphase - separateddropletsinvitro , and the MED1 - IDR facilitates phase separation in living cells . Droplets formed by MED1 - IDR are capable of concentrating transcriptional machinery in a transcriptionally competent nuclear extract . These results support a model in which tran - scriptional coactivators form phase - separated condensates that compartmentalize and concen - trate the transcription apparatus at SE - regulated genes and identify SE components that likely play a role in phase separation . SEs are established by the binding of master TFs to enhancer clusters ( 14 , 15 ) . These TFs typ - ically consist of a structured DNA - binding domain and an intrinsically disordered transcriptional activation domain ( 50 – 52 ) . The activation do - mainsoftheseTFsrecruithighdensitiesofmanytranscriptionproteins , which , as a class , are enriched for IDRs ( 53 ) . Although the exact client - scaffold relationship ( 54 ) between these components remains unknown , it is likely that these protein sequences mediate weak multi - valent interactions , thereby facilitating conden - sation . We propose that condensation of such high - valency factors at SEs creates a reaction cruciblewithintheseparateddensephase , where high local concentrations of the transcriptional machinery ensure robust gene expression . The nuclear organization of chromosomes is likely influenced by condensates at SEs . DNA interactiontechnologiesindicatethattheindividual enhancers within the SEs have exceptionally high interactionfrequencieswithoneanother ( 16 – 18 ) , consistent with the idea that condensates draw these elements into close proximity in the dense phase . Several recent studies suggest that SEs can interact with one another and may also con - tributeinthisfashiontochromosomeorganization ( 55 , 56 ) . Cohesin , an SMC ( structural maintenance of chromosomes ) protein complex , has been im - plicated in constraining SE - SE interactions be - causeitslosscausesextensivefusionofSEswithin the nucleus ( 56 ) . These SE - SE interactions may be due to a tendency of liquid - phase condensates to undergo fusion ( 1 – 3 ) . The model whereby phase separation of co - activators compartmentalizes and concentrates the transcription apparatus at SEs and their regulatedgenes , describedhereandcorroborated by ( 57 ) , raises many questions . How does con - densation contribute to regulation of transcrip - tional output ? A study of RNA Pol II clusters , which may be phase - separated condensates , suggests a positive correlation between conden - sate lifetimeand transcriptional output ( 58 ) . What components drive formation and dissolution of transcriptional condensates ? Our studies indi - cate that BRD4 and MED1 likely participate , but the roles of DNA - binding TFs , RNA Pol II , and regulatory RNAs require further study . Why do some proteins , such as HP1a , contribute to phase - separated heterochromatin condensates ( 59 , 60 ) and others contribute to euchromatic condensates ? The rules that govern partitioning into specific types of condensates have begun to bestudied ( 61 – 65 ) andwillneed tobedefined for proteins involved in transcriptional condensates . Does condensate misregulation contribute to pathological processes in disease , and will new insights into condensate behaviors present new opportunities for therapy ? Mutations within IDRs and misregulation of phase separation have already been implicated in a number of neurodegenerative diseases ( 66 – 68 ) . Tumor cells have exceptionally large SEs at driver on - cogenes that are not found in their cell of origin , and some of these are exceptionally sensitive to drugs that target SE components ( 22 – 25 ) .

Methods summary Immunofluorescence against BRD4 and MED1 , coupled with DNA - FISH or RNA - FISH against SEs or SE - driven nascent transcripts , was per - formed in mESCs to visualize the colocaliza - tion between BRD4 or MED1 puncta and SEs .
