Mechanical strain encountered in the central nervous system can arise from diverse mechanisms , such as tissue reorganization , ﬂuid ﬂow , and axon growth , as well as pathological events including axon swelling or mechanical trauma . Biomechanical relevance of the in vitro mechanical testing requires to be placed in line with the physiological and mechanical changes in central nervous tissues that occur during the progression of neurodegenerative diseases . Mechanotransduction signaling utilized by glial cells and the recent approaches intended to model altered microenvironment adapted to pathological context are discussed in this review . New insights in systems merging substrate’s stiffness and topography should be considered for further glial mechanotransduction studies , while testing platforms for drug discoveries promise great advancements in pharmacotherapy .

INTRODUCTION Glial cells are largely involved in neural tissue remodeling throughout the physiological and pathological development of the ner - vous system . Glial cells also participate in the regenerative process after injury . 1 , 2 These cells have the ability to perceive the mechanical signals driven by microenvironmental changes . Although neural diseases have multiple known origins ( genetic defect , congenital disorder , tumor , autoimmunity , trauma , infection , environmental health , tissue mechanics , etc . ) , tissue mechanics is described as a major mechanism encountered and often driving pathogenesis . 3 , 4 Particularly when the tissue integrity is affected , the homeostasis is dysregulated , and the mechanical changes are , therefore , among the main signal that cells are sensing . Since tissue damage or malformation leads to profound changes in the mechanical properties of the nervous tissue , it is essen - tial to understand the response of these glial cells toward microenvi - ronmental mechanical changes in order to restore tissue homeostasis and function . Recent discoveries concerning the mechanosensitivity of glial cells have contributed to our understanding of the mechanisms of action by which these cells probe and interact with their surrounding substrates and juxtaposed cells . Speciﬁcally , glial cells adapt to the physiological or pathological context using mechanosensing capacity , through mechanotransduc - tion machinery . In principle , mechanotransduction is the result of cell sensing , integration , and conversion of external mechanical cues into biochemical signals . 5 The mechanical stimuli that are derived from cell substrate stiffness and surface tension affect the cell plasma membrane tension and result in ion inﬂux and signaling pathways activation . On a side note , the underlying pathways ( e . g . , stretched - activated ion channel signaling , 6 integrin signaling , 7 actomyosin contractility , 8 Hippo pathway , 9 and the transcription factor Yap / Taz 10 ) governing these mechanisms are often interconnected , depending on the nature of the mechanical signal . Thus , it is not surprising to ﬁnd that glial cells are strongly involved in the pathogenesis of neurological diseases since physiological perturbations recorded in the central nervous sys - tem ( CNS ) distort tissue mechanical stiffness and homeostasis . 3 , 11 Even slight changes in the properties of the brain extracellular matrix ( ECM ) or extracellular ﬂuid pressure caused by disease progression may result in tissue stiffening and compression , which in turn lead to an alteration in the mechanical signaling . For instance , tissue stiffening is prevalent in traumatic injuries , 12 dementia , 13 and Alzheimer’s APL Bioeng . 5 , 021505 ( 2021 ) ; doi : 10 . 1063 / 5 . 0037814 5 , 021505 - 1 V C Author ( s ) 2021 APL Bioengineering REVIEW scitation . org / journal / apb disease ( AD ) . 14 – 16 On the other hand , soft mechanical signature of glial scars has been recorded in the CNS 17 for multiple sclerosis ( MS ) 18 and glioma . 19 Therefore , emphasis has been placed on studying glial mecha - nobiology to understand the mechanotransduction signals that are involved in response to changes in microenvironment mechanical properties . 4 The mechanobiology area has advanced in tools and tech - niques to reproduce as faithfully as possible the physiological con - straints associated with disease development . In this review , we emphasize the emerging focus on glial mecha - notransduction with the development of biomimicking platforms to study the cell behavior in disease models through various mechanical stimuli and potential underlying ﬁndings in pharmacotherapy . Hence , we will elucidate the physiological and mechanical changes in CNS tis - sues that occur during the progression of neurodegenerative diseases . Then , we will discuss the current and recent advances in engineering systems that may be used to impart mechanical stresses ( hydrogels , motorized forms , spatial constraints , cell - topography interaction sys - tems , magnetic - induced traction , and micro / nanopatterning ) to cells in the context of glial cells . The compilation of the latest works on mechanotransduction signaling utilized by glial cells and the recent approaches intended to model altered microenvironment adapted to pathological context by modulating substrate’s stiffness and control - ling cell responses will be developed . Finally , potential leads and strate - gies for clinical outcomes will be discussed as a perspective . II . MECHANICAL STIFFNESS VARIATION IN THE DISEASED AND AGING CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM Besides the well - understood involvement of biomolecular signal - ing in disease progression , it is becoming clear that mechanotransduc - tion may also be involved due to changes in tissue stiffness and cytoskeletal structures . 11 This section summarizes the variations in mechanical stiffness and ECM modiﬁcations that are encountered within the CNS and associated pathologies and encompasses the limits of current methods , highlighting the precautions and parameters to be considered when studying a particular condition . We envision that this section can be read as a database to allow the rapid establishment of a system reproducing physiological conditions that are necessary for the most reliable study of the mechanotransduction pathways used in the chosen case . Data have , therefore , been compiled in Table I enclosed , while short physiopathological description can be found in Subsections IIA – IIG . A . Regional CNS stiffness variation The CNS comprises of a heterogeneous distribution of neural cells and their respective ECM , and the organization of cellular and ECM components vary across different regions . 20 – 22 This unique tis - sue structure confers heterogeneous cell mechanobiology and mechan - ical properties . The mechanical behavior of the brain and spinal cord tissues is , therefore , an essential element in understanding biological responses in the case of trauma and pathologies . Studies have revealed variation in stiffness properties emanating cellular compliance . 23 For instance , one of the functions of glial cells is to embed the neurons , which possess higher mechanical compliance . 24 Glial cells provide neurons with physical protection against mechanical aggression and trauma . 22 Hence , stiffness differences have been recorded between the white and gray matter . Speciﬁcally , the white matter contains bundled myelinated axons and is often presented with stiffer properties than the gray matter , where neuron somas are found . Therefore , the cell - type dependent intrinsic stiffness variation is thought to be involved in such a phenomenon . Rheological studies have described the CNS tis - sue characteristics similar to those of a non - linear viscoelastic mate - rial . 24 Indeed , neural cytoskeleton and the ECM networks stiffen when they are increasingly deformed . 24 Also , modifying the probed axis of the brain yields different outcomes . To explain this variation , it was suggested that the brain mechanical properties vary depending on the orientation and methodology chosen , which results from the charac - teristic anisotropic structure of the brain . Moreover , local stiffness is likely to change after a traumatic injury or brain disease . In particular , brain stiffness decreases in neurodegenerative disorders that are thought to be related to an impairment in neurogenesis . 25 B . Aging Over the course of time , many changes occur in the brain micro - environment , including loss of neuronal - glial cell connectivity and cell depletion accompanied by progressive alteration of the ECM . Thus , brain stiffness undergoes a continuous and linear decrease over aging , leading to brain atrophy . 26 The inner brain is physiologically stiffer than cortical brain tissue , but the age - related brain atrophy is heteroge - neous and results in regional brain softening due to the early shrinking of gray matter starting from the adolescence . 27 The annual decline for the cerebrum stiffness was evaluated at (cid:2) 8Pa per year for patient - s < 60years old 28 and (cid:2) 11Pa for patients > 60years old . 29 The overall brain stiffness decline is estimated to be between (cid:2) 4 . 9Pa and (cid:2) 13 . 6Pa per year . 28 Mechanical stiffnesses of the diverse brain region can be found in Table I . However , precautions are required when choosing the model which must be in line with the method used for an optimal deﬁnition of the corresponding model . Arani et al . utilized a mathematical model to predict the theoretical cerebrum stiffness of 2 . 56 6 0 . 08kPa for the age of 76years old based on a 60 – 80 aged cohort , 29 while Takamura et al . recently reﬁned the model with an estimated cerebrum stiffness at 2 . 35kPa at the age of 41 with a younger cohort comprising of 20 – 60 - year - old patients . 28 The difference in methodology could explain the softer measurement from the latter study . C . Demyelinating diseases—Multiple sclerosis Demyelinating diseases result in a lack of myelin and are often associated with ECM modiﬁcation . 13 , 18 , 30 A particular disease associ - ated with a local decrease in brain tissue stiffness is multiple sclerosis . The development of this inﬂammatory disease is characterized by the progressive destruction of myelin , leading to the loss of axonal myeli - nation and the basement membrane . Additionally , an increase in ﬁbrillar collagens , which results in perivascular ﬁbrosis , is observed . 17 In this case , the control of ECM expression by glial cells is disturbed . Subsequently , this leads to an increased proteoglycan production and hyaluronic acid ( HA ) secretion , which will accumulate in the vicinity of the demyelinated axon and impair remyelination . 31 , 32 However , these changes in the glial microenvironment do not always follow the same process . Indeed , the tissue mechanical properties in demyelinat - ing diseases depend on the severity and chronicity of the pathology . A recent study highlighted that acute demyelination could be reversed when followed by remyelination , resulting in reduced tissue APL Bioengineering REVIEW scitation . org / journal / apb APL Bioeng . 5 , 021505 ( 2021 ) ; doi : 10 . 1063 / 5 . 0037814 5 , 021505 - 2 V C Author ( s ) 2021 TABLE I .

Initially , the stiffness dif - ferences could be explained by the inﬁltration of macrophages and microglia activation in the acute lesion . Thereafter , astrogliosis was observed in the chronic lesion with glial cells expressing increased lev - els of cytoskeleton ﬁlaments [ glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein ( GFAP ) and vimentin ] as well as ECM components ( ﬁbronectin , ﬁbrillar collagen , biglycan , and decorin ) 35 in greater amount presenting the hallmark of an active lesion . D . Alzheimer’s disease In dementia , and particularly in Alzheimer’s disease ( AD ) , the changes in ECM composition are associated with a loss of matrix mol - ecules’ content that are essential in sustaining progenitors and stem cell niches in the brain . The brain mechanical stiffness was found to be reduced mostly in the regions that are affected by the pathology , including frontal , parietal , and temporal lobes 14 , 36 ( Table I ) . In addi - tion , this phenomenon intensiﬁes along with the severity of the pathol - ogy . Also , Alzheimer’s disease is characterized by the formation of amyloid plaques along with intracellular neuroﬁbrillary tangles which results in the loss of neuronal network connectivity and functionality , followed by brain atrophy . 15 The early amyloid ﬁbrils deposition is prone to favor an increase in brain stiffness , while the progressive syn - aptic loss and neurodegeneration result in an overall stiffness loss of 22 . 5 % . 37 E . Spinal cord injury and CNS trauma Glial cells are reported to be more compliant than neurons . 24 , 38 However , the activation and accumulation of astrocytes and microglia in glial scar signiﬁcantly increase the tissue stiffness after spinal cord injury . 22 In acute brain injury , tenascin upregulation in sites around brain lesions stiffen the ECM , 39 leading to long - term deleterious effects . Besides that , the remodeling of neurogenic niche after an injury can participate in long term issues in brain functionality , leading to chronic diseases . 40 However , in a recent study , tissue softening was recorded after traumatic injury of neural tissue , which correlates with an increased expression of matrix molecules ( Laminin , collagen IV ) and cytoskeleton component ( GFAP and vimentin ) ( Table I ) . 17 F . Gliosis and glioma The modulation of the ECM expression during gliosis and glioma progression leads to an increase in brain stiffness ( Table I ) . 3 , 41 Additionally , brain stiffness was found to increase by 10 fold , reaching E ¼ 1000Pa in gliobastoma . 3 As previously stated , ECM is not the only cause of brain stiffness , but glial cells also play an important role in determining tissue rigidity because of their ability to modulate their intrinsic mechanical characteristics in response to chemical or mechanical signals . For instance , ischemia - induced gliosis resulted in the upregulation of GFAP expression in M € uller glial cells , which in turn led to a global cell stiffening . 42 Considerable changes in ECM composition , cell expression , and properties occur after brain injury and in neurodegenerative diseases .

G . Importance of matrix compliance throughout neurogenesis for in vitro models Both ECM and intrinsic cell rigidity contribute to tissue stiffness and vary throughout neural development . During neurogenesis , neural stem cells sense the changes in their microenvironment driving the dif - ferentiation in neural lineage and following a sequence of changes . The differentiation in speciﬁc cell types is driven by preferential bio - mechanical cues . For instance , neuronal differentiation occurs ﬁrst in brain development 43 and neurites growth preferentially under very soft matrix stiffness conditions in vitro ( elastic modulus E ¼ 200Pa ) , while astrocytes spread on the stiffer environment ( E ¼ 9000Pa ) . 44 , 45 Likewise , oligodendrocyte ( OL ) differentiation and maturation are triggered when the stiffness of the microenvironment is around E ¼ 6500Pa . 46 Therefore , the cellular preference in the microenviron - ment rigidity demonstrates that an interplay occurs between intracel - lular contractile forces and extracellular attachment in neural cell lineage . 38 III . ENGINEERED METHODS TO UNDERSTAND GLIAL RESPONSE TO MECHANOTRANSDUCTION Understanding the mechanisms of mechanotransduction ( con - version of mechanical signals into a cascade of biochemical phenom - ena ) 4 and their contribution to development , physiology , and cerebrospinal diseases represent a major challenge in glial mechanobi - ology . To unravel the cellular mechanisms involved in glial mechano - transduction , engineering cell culture systems are required to better understand the molecular interplays which are speciﬁc to mechanical stimuli encountered or leading to a pathological context . Notable advances have recently been published in the ﬁeld of in vitro engineer - ing systems . The platforms are expected to reproduce the CNS matrix with faithful physiological conformity , thereby allowing the study of a deﬁned signaling pathway that may be involved in the biological phe - nomenon that is driven by a speciﬁc mechanical stimuli . Additionally , these platforms and culture systems were designed to evaluate the bio - mechanical characteristics that cells could detect in order to determine the signaling pathways and downstream elements involved in various cellular behaviors , such as cell activation , proliferation , spreading , dif - ferentiation , polarization , or myelination . The current techniques and strategies to study mechanosensing in glial cells are discussed below . A . Small scale techniques Force - application techniques ( AFM , optical tweezers ) are stan - dard methods to study mechanobiology and mechanical probing of mechanotransduction at the single cell level . 24 , 47 AFM provide the lowest force ( 5 – 10 pN ) , while optical tweezers ( 0 . 1 – 100 pN ) , pipette aspiration ( 10 pM – 1 nN ) , and magnetic tweezers ( 0 . 1 – 1nN ) can deliver higher force magnitude . 48 These techniques remain , unfortu - nately , cell - selective , low throughput , and invasive methods , mimick - ing acute stress for cells by their possible insult to the plasma membrane and their cortical shell integrity . B . 2D gels In order to modulate the external forces that cells can sense , it is necessary to adjust their microenvironment . Several approaches can be considered to generate mechanical tension such as biophysical modulation by tunable mechanical stiffness , appropriate topography , extracellular matrix coating , and culture in dynamic conditions or in three - dimensions . 49 , 50 Research in natural or synthetic materials has highlighted a wide range of possibilities to obtain the desired stiffness , viscosity , or topography to study mechanotransduction ( Table II ) . Inert and artiﬁcial substrates have been developed to offer the oppor - tunity to study cell behavior under precisely deﬁned mechanical condi - tions on a two - dimensional ( 2D ) hydrogel . 1 . Polyacrylamide gels Cyto - compatible materials such as polyacrylamide ( PAA ) hydro - gel can be fabricated with a range of elasticities ( shear modulus G 0 ¼ 0 . 01 – 230kPa ) simply by varying the amount of the polymer ( acryl - amide ) and its crosslinker ( bis - acrylamide ) . Increasing cross - linker concentration proportionally increases the PAA gel elastic modulus until reaching an inﬂection point which is changed according to the PAA initial concentration . 51 , 52 These modiﬁcations are not inducing an additional biological stimulus since this is a biologically inert mate - rial that does not intrinsically support cell adhesion . Thus , stiffness can be tuned without biological concern . 53 Polyacrylamide gels exhibit a strong homogeneity in surface topography , mechanical properties , and coating density—features which are crucial for reproducibility . The high biocompatibility and the magnitude of stiffness range avail - able makes PAA hydrogels an ideal starting matrix to reproduce CNS physiological range of mechanical stiffness . Ideally , the gel surface can be functionalized by the addition of adhesive polymers ( polyly - sine ) , 53 – 55 matrigel , 56 region - speciﬁc ECM proteins ( collagen I , colla - gen IV , laminin and ﬁbronectin ) , 7 , 9 , 57 – 59 or ECM peptides ( RGD , IKVAV , LRE ) 60 , 61 to the mixture when studying particular tissue envi - ronment . ECM protein or peptide density can be tailored to deﬁne the surface chemistry of the material precisely . 62 These models are simple to develop and can easily demonstrate cellular signaling by selectively evaluating one single effect . For instance , neuronal differentiation can be promoted by soft platforms ( 0 . 1 – 0 . 5kPa ) , while stiffer ones ( 1 – 10kPa ) favored the appearance of glial cells of astrocytic phenotype . 60 , 63 In the same fashion , the survival and proliferation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells ( OPC ) were modulated by substrate stiffness ( 0 . 1 – 70kPa ) . 46 , 55 PAA matrices reproducing CNS mechanical properties in native and traumatic con - texts ( 1 . 5 and 30kPa , respectively ) were used to highlight that stiff matrix impaired the myosin activity by inhibiting OL branching and differentiation in contrast to Schwann cells which were not affected by the change in rigidity . 64 One must consider that one of the major disadvantages of PAA gel is the change in porosity accompanied by the change in mechanical properties , leading to modiﬁed biological responses with regard to cell fate . 65 Furthermore , challenges and troubleshooting for PAA gels include the ﬁndings of the correct set of parameters ( e . g . , UV intensity , light wavelength , exposure time , distance from UV lamp , initiator con - centration , gel thickness , and acrylamide and bis - acrylamide concen - tration ) , the uneven gel attachment which is a particular issue encountered during gel - gradient fabrication , and heterogenous gel APL Bioengineering REVIEW scitation . org / journal / apb APL Bioeng . 5 , 021505 ( 2021 ) ; doi : 10 . 1063 / 5 . 0037814 5 , 021505 - 7 V C Author ( s ) 2021 thickness .

Polydimethylsiloxane ( PDMS ) gels Other studies used polydimethylsiloxane ( PDMS ) to explore mechanotransduction in neural and particularly glial cells ( elastic modulus ¼ 1kPa – 4MPa ) . 9 , 66 , 67 PDMS rigidity was tuned to study the effect of mechanical stiffness on glial proliferation , differentiation , and maturation . 9 , 66 , 68 – 70 The good elastic property enables numerous applications for PDMS elastomers in micro - engineering ( micropillars ) or as a stretchable material to test the effects mechanical forces on cells . Details on the recent research will be speciﬁed in Sec . IIIE1 . However , the inert and nonfouling characteristics of these synthetic materials require additional modiﬁcations to ensure proper cell attach - ment and integrin signaling , including the adsorption of charge enhancers ( polylysine , poly - ornithine ) 66 , 68 or the covalent binding of adhesive ECM proteins ( laminin , ﬁbronectin ) . 6 , 71 The nature of the generated biological interactions and especially the coating density are critical parameters that must be tightly controlled while attempting to reproduce cell attachment model as these models may differ from the biological reality . Similarly to PAA gels , functionalization of PDMS gel with ECM protein or ECM - derived peptides can be carried out with a protein crosslinker agent . The latter are interesting for tissue engineer - ing due to their ease of manipulation , incorporation into biomaterials and minimal impact on the mechanical characteristics of the gel . 72 The optimal choice of the substrate - protein combination will depend on the biological relevance of the reproduced tissue microenviron - ment . When the complexity of the natural habitat of the cells is difﬁ - cult to reproduce in vitro or when it is desired to decouple signaling integrins , a simpliﬁed coating model based only on the modiﬁcation of the surface charge with a polylysine coating can be used to improve cell adhesion and cell spreading . 7 , 53 As a result , hydrogels are often used as compliant growth sub - strates and can be ﬁne - tuned to optimize their homogeneity in surface topography , mechanical properties , and coating density . For a study looking for compliant materials , it is advisable to start with PAA , while the search for a larger structural stiffness will prefer to work on a PDMS substrate . 3 . Other synthetic and biohybrid gels Other synthetic gels were less frequently used to assess glial mechanotransduction by tuning their mechanical stiffness . Polyethyleneglycol ( PEG ) based gel of relatively low stiffness ( 3 . 4kPa ) was utilized to study neural cell biology and behavior . 73 , 74 Mixing natural - based materials with synthetic compounds to enhance biophysical properties and biocompatibility of the hydrogel is a developing strategy . Bioorthogonal polymer cross - linking , such as tetrazine - norbornene ligation , can be performed to obtain in situ hydrogels suitable for three - dimensional ( 3D ) cell culture . 75 Herein , the catalytic oxidation of the dihydrogen tetrazine using horseradish peroxidase enhanced the gelation time and grant gel stiffness modula - tion . By applying this method , PEG was added to gelatin to form tun - able stiffness composite hydrogels ( storage modulus ¼ 1 . 2 – 3 . 8kPa ) . 76 The viability of encapsulated cells was enhanced and could be applied to glial and neuronal cell culture as an improved method of studying mechanosensitivity in a 3D model . 4 . Hydrogels from natural materials Biomaterials of natural origins have been used to culture glial cells , mainly for differentiation assays , and sometimes to assess mechanical stiffness . Among them , hyaluronic acid ( HA ) , 58 , 77 – 79 colla - gen I , 80 , 81 gelatin , 82 matrigel , 83 ﬁbrin , 44 modiﬁed chitosan , 84 algi - nate , 85 , 86 and agarose 87 have been used on astrocytes and neural progenitor cells ( NPCs ) . These materials are mostly isolated from native surrounding ECM and basal lamina and contains adhesive sites for cells and , therefore , do not require additional functionalization nor surface modiﬁcation to allow cell attachment . For instance , HA , which reproduces the native microenvironment that surrounds glial cells , incorporates CD - 44 binding site that facilitates neural cell adhesion , while ECM polymeric proteins such as collagen , laminin , and ﬁbro - nectin provides integrin binding sites . Other plant - based and non mammalian polymers would still require surface functionalization . Although substrate stiffness was not assessed for some of those hydro - gels , these studies deserve to be mentioned in this section as tremen - dous effort in developing ECM - resembling microenvironment has been the made in the last few years . Notwithstanding , due to their nat - ural origin , such materials suffer high variability in structure and com - position with signiﬁcant batch - to - batch changes in biomolecule composition and proportion . This heterogeneity added with higher structural complexity hinder proper experimental design to decouple biochemical from mechanical stimulus . For those reasons , synthetic - based hydrogels have been preferred for their bioinert properties , their well controlled content and their ease to modulate substrate stiffness . Finally , self - assembled nanopeptides have been demonstrated suitable for glial cell culture . 88 Apparent physiological mechanical stiffness can be tuned though enzymatic addition or pH changes and hydrogel con - structs have been designed to be incorporated with ECM components that are native to nerve tissues ( e . g . , heparan sulfate proteoglycan and laminin peptide IKVAV ) . 88 – 90 5 . Recently engineered gels used to study mechanotransduction for different cell types Recent developments in biomaterial engineering techniques have signiﬁcantly improved the manufacturing capabilities of systems for analyzing cellular mechanotransduction . Hydrogels have become intensely complex and have obtained interesting new properties . Stiffness gradient hydrogel is the direct evolution from the substrate stiffness assay using various hydrogels with low to high mechanical stiffness . Gradient hydrogel can be generated by differential diffusion distance of unreacted crosslinker and monomer into pre - polymerized gel . With such system , one can attest the effect of local stiffness varia - tion on cell mechanosensivity in a controlled manner and at a small scale . 91 The incorporation of magnetic nano or microparticle in hydrogel permit the fabrication of a magnetic sensitive biomaterial . 92 Magnetic hydrogels are now envisioned as a therapeutic biomaterial for spinal cord regeneration . 93 The magnetic ﬁeld allow the control of the align - ment of polymer ﬁbers to generate a topography resembling the aniso - tropic architecture of spinal cord microenvironment . 94 , 95 Correspondingly , dorsal root ganglion neurons that were cultured in native stiffness - mimicking magnetic hydrogels demonstrated activa - tion of mechanosensitive ion channels , TRPV4 and Piezo2 . 96 This model could be transversally applied to glial cells study .

Small mechanical forces are exerted through near infrared light pulse under spatiotemporal control . The authors have designed a thin , soft , and patterned synthetic gel that comprised of acrylamide variants and gold nanorods ( AuNRs ) for photothermal responsiveness . This approach has opened new insights into mechano - transduction studies by providing forces at low magnitudes in a natural - mimicking cyclic stimulus , rather than constant strain that is associated with classic hydrogels . For instance , this technique could be very useful in looking at quick molecular events , such as cell signaling pathway activation , nuclear translocation of mechanosensors or cell membrane dynamics . 97 The design of hydrogels has considerably complexiﬁed to give rise to new systems with ﬁne and intricate properties , such as photo - responsive hydrogels , 98 thermoresponsive hydrogels , 92 , 99 stiffening hydrogels , 100 Matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) - degradable hydrogel platforms 101 or conductive hydrogels . 102 Among these new hydrogels , many may have properties which could satisfy new demands in the study of mechanotransduction pathways . 48 , 92 , 103 – 105 C . 3D gels Tissue - engineered models in 3D are developing for CNS applica - tion . 80 , 81 , 106 , 107 Reproducible 3D culture system based on alginate gel have been developed to monitor neurite outgrowth 108 and to mimic astrogliosis . 86 While tuning the material amount , mesh size evolves inversely proportional to alginate content to form the hydrogel . Alginate hydrogel has typical mechanical properties with a solid - like character , represented by storage modulus ( G 0 ) , predominant over liquid - like viscous feature or loss modulus ( G 00 ) . Also , PEG was used to construct a three - dimensional hydrogel and demonstrated the importance of mesh nets size along with storage modulus to modulate OPC proliferation and lineage commitment . 109 The focus is now on developing 3D micropatterned biomaterial systems which enable the seamless integration with experimental cell mechanics in a controlled 3D microenvironment . 110 For instance , synthetic ﬁbrous collagen - wise material with tunable mechanics and user - deﬁned architecture has been developed and could be applied for glial cell culture . 111 Also , a biosynthetic elastin - like matrix was used to study neural progenitor cell ( NPC ) differentiation exposing cells to native brain tissue stiffness ( elastic moduli (cid:4) 0 . 5 – 1 . 5kPa ) . 112 D . Microbeads and spatial constraints Other types of mechanical stress can be generated by the addition of micro - objects restricting the interstitial space and exerting spatial constraints on the cells ( Table III ) . Microspheres are used in culture to generate this spatial constraint in high cell density , reproducing spatial restriction encountered in brain diseases such as gliosis or after injury and ﬂuid inﬁltration leading to tissue compression . Space reduction induced by plating microspheres enhances OPCs’ differentiation and generation of myelinated ﬁbers . 113 This method is simple and poten - tially useful to reproduce space constraint . However , it does not mimic the normal physiological conditions and lack the matrix substrate interaction for studying the mechanotransduction involved in other phenomenon . 114 T AB L E II .

Nanotopography Topographical cues have been demonstrated to play an impor - tant role in determining cell fate . Topographical interaction can be studied by speciﬁc patterns and designed culture substrate to mimic deﬁned conditions encountered in CNS tissues ( stem cell niche , topography - directed neurogenesis , demyelination , axon and neurite extension , etc . ) . Different methods exist to design a particular topogra - phy ( Table IV ) . Among them , nanotopography can be used to design precise ( lithography ) or random surface features ( nanotube , porous membrane , electrospinning , self - assembled nanoﬁber ) that may be applicable to study glial cell behavior when designing scaffold for neu - ral regeneration . 115 These systems may be extended to understand glia mechanotransduction . 1 . Nanolithography obtained patterns PDMS is a suitable starter biomaterial to design well - deﬁned pat - terns . Customizable multi - architecture chip ( MARC ) array based on PDMS was used to build distinct topographies of various architectural complexities , including both isotropic and anisotropic features , in nano - to micrometer dimensions , with different aspect ratios and hier - archical structures . 116 , 117 The cost - effective feature of micropillars make this method suitable for high throughput screening assays for glial cell behavior to topographical cues . 118 This method could be effectively applied to study glial mechanotransduction in an attempt to reproduce the particular brain or spinal topography . Anisotropically grating patterned substrates are used to study glial cell differentia - tion . 117 In particular , Ankam et al . used this technique to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of topography - induced differentiation of human embryonic stem cells ( hESCs ) toward neuronal lineages . 119 In addition , suspended microﬁbers were recently fabricated via low - voltage 3D micropatterning . 120 Nonetheless , the restriction of cell anchoring sites is also the main disadvantage of this technique , which considerably limits the mechanisms of cell spreading and migration that can generate signaling biases in mechanotransduction pathways . 2 . Artificial axons Henceforth , growing interest in establishing the mechanosensing capacity of myelinating cells by modulating microenvironmental and biomechanical characteristics in vitro is arising . Although the link between mechanotransduction and myelination is not fully deter - mined at the molecular level , the activation of the mechanotransduc - tion pathways is thought to be essential for the quality of myelination . 38 A focus on developing synthetic neuronal axons dis - playing the biochemistry , morphology , and carrying biophysical char - acteristics of its biological analog has been increasing over the past recent years . Electrospinning can produce nano - to microﬁbers mim - icking the axon biophysical cues including ﬁber diameter ( 0 . 5 – 2 l m ) , alignment and density . Therefore , electrospun artiﬁcial axons had been proposed as a model for studying myelination since the geometry of the substrate could facilitate cell surface interaction , spreading , and wrapping in the absence of neural factors . 121 Under controlled bio - chemical cues of soluble factors determining their differentiation and maturation , OLs can extend their plasma membrane and generate a simulacrum of myelin sheath around the artiﬁcial axons . 122 The direct visualization and quantiﬁcation of myelin formation offered by these biomimetic platforms is thought to be an optimal system for pharma - cological agent screening and testing . 123 , 124 In this sense , artiﬁcial ﬁbers can be used to assess stiffness changes in the microenvironment by modulating the nature , length and diameter of the ﬁbers . 125 Suspended ﬁbers are thought to be an optimized model that overcome the inﬂuence of the support ( glass generally ) to better control the structural stiffness of the ﬁber mesh . 124 The intrinsic and mechanical stiffness of these suspended ﬁbers can be tuned to study mechano - transduction pathways in OL differentiation and myelination . 125 Several biomaterials have been tested as a ﬁber substrate , including polystyrene , polylactic acid ( PLA ) , polycaprolactone ( PCL ) , and gela - tin , and showed the possibility of modulating myelination in deﬁned conditions . 122 , 125 The stiffness range of such model is the closest to native condition , as compared to other topography study system ( micropillars ) or ﬁber fabrication systems . Another aspect that compels the high interest in ﬁber - based mye - lination platform is the possibility to test out drugs and discover potential target for therapeutic treatment . Inert ﬁbers are able to receive different types of coating to functionalize their surface in order to sustainably deliver non - viral genes ( microRNA ) and protein drugs . 123 Classical myelination assays , which consists ofOL - neuron co - culture , have very low throughput and are time - consuming . Thus , this can be considered as a good developing model for high through - put screening system for drug testing to target myelination process under deﬁned mechanical conditions . 125 Furthermore , current plat - forms for high throughput in vitro assays have been designed to assesses myelination of living axons . This type of assay is optimal for screening large compound libraries to identify new targets and drugs that stimulate myelination . 126 Although , this system is advantageous on non - biological substrate which does not incorporate the complex cellular neural - glial interactions , it lacks the mechanical aspect of it . Engineering systems with tunable mechanical properties could be therefore developed for co - culture study . Although effort have been put to develop 3D culture for glia , elec - trospun ﬁbers are material - dependent regarding their intrinsic stiff - ness . Hence , structural and intrinsic stiffnesses remain vastly far from native CNS and axon stiffness respectively . 111 , 125 Nonetheless , there is no available platform to date that better mimics both topography and CNS stiffness to study the behavior of glial cells in response to stiffness changes . Additionally , recent ﬁndings have demonstrated the fabrication of 3D - printed engineered artiﬁcial axons . 127 The authors described their product as minimally supported aligned ﬁbers in mechanically compliant range ( 0 . 1 – 1000kPa ) and with a relatively small diameter ( 5 – 20 l m ) . The appeal of this platform lies in the fact that those fea - tures can be independently modulated to reproduce speciﬁc physio - pathological states arousing interest to study myelination process under deﬁned conditions encountered by OLs in vivo . Their work showed that myelin production and wrapping is dependent on ﬁber diameter , stiffness , and surface ligand interaction . The application of this model to mechanical stretching platform can be considered as a challenge . Improvements are required to develop a universal and reproducible system that could be scaled up . The production of artiﬁ - cial ﬁbers by 3D printing technology could be an alternative but the resolution is not able to produce axon - like diameters under 10 l m at the moment .

Notwithstanding , 3D - printing machine deﬁni - tion is emerging and constantly upgrading , granting expectations to improve on the resolution matter soon . 127 F . Externally applied forces ( motorized platform ) Advanced platforms can be compatible with dynamic systems that can add a new dimension of mechanical stress related to tissue deformation ( Table V ) . Two types of motorized devices are found in literature , the tensile strain and stretching platforms . Dynamic cell cul - ture systems are often used to apply mechanical stimulus to reproduce physiological constraints and forces perceived by cells . Especially in the case of glial cells , dynamic platforms can mimic cell elongation , such as axonal growth , during brain development to assess glial response to the generated forces . In addition , stretching stresses repro - duce the deformation of CNS tissues following trauma . 128 – 130 Thus , a compliant and ﬂexible matrix is necessary to obtain a deformable cell substrate . For instance , elastic polymeric gels and thin crosslinked sili - cone ﬁlms following traction or stretched force are used as culture models to measure the effect of substrate rigidity on cell mechanistics . As previously stated , the matrix elastic properties can be modiﬁed by changing the ratio of monomer to crosslinker in polyacrylamide gels . 131 In biomechanics , the force - velocity relationship between the matrix compliance and the ability of cells to be mechanosensitive can be explained by the two - spring model based on the linear elasticity of hydrogels . In summary , soft substrates increase the force needed to maintain the stability of an adhesion , while on rigid surfaces this force is reduced when the actomyosin system is already fully mobilized to stabilize the focal adhesions . 132 Therefore , the optimal situation for a cell would be to have a surrounding matrix stiffness of the same mag - nitude as that of cell compliance . In practice , a Matrigel - coated pre - stretched silicon substrate was used as a matrix to directly address the effect of mechanical forces on nuclear heterochromatin organization in OPCs . The platform was mounted in a device that generates uniaxial cell deformation upon mechanical release of the substrate . 133 Such assay resumes mechanical compression by spatial restriction and exhibits comparable stimulus generated by microsphere space constraint . Thus , the authors identi - ﬁed SYNE1 as a key mechanotransducer in the nuclear envelope com - plex ( LINC ) and transmits the mechanical stress to the nucleoskeleton , subsequently leading to the formation of heterochro - matin , a main step in the OL differentiation . Also , the application of tensile strain to cells plated on elastomeric PDMS plates is a model developed recently . 67 , 134 Mechanical stretching was used to demon - strate the differential cell commitment to glial lineage along with the importance of ECM nature to direct oligodendrocyte differentia - tion , 135 or the regulation of the astrocytic endothelin secretion through ion channel activation . 136 Glial morphological changes and nuclear translocation of mechanotransducer Yes - Associated Protein ( YAP ) could be veriﬁed by the dynamic stimulation . 9 , 10 Katiyar et al . used a stretching platform coated with Matrigel or collagen I to engineer a “living scaffold” based on long astrocytes processes . 137 Such model could open the way to explore mechanotransduction in co - culture model on motorized platforms . Also , a novel cell - stretching array platform was designed to obtain deﬁned cellular alignment in vitro , 138 which is an interesting feature that can be easily applied for glial cell culture . Yet , these platforms still lack a long response time and are yet limited in generating homogeneous uniaxial or bidirectional forces regardless of the spatial stimulation . Recent advancement in engineering three - motorized stage system allowing imaging during the two phases of the cyclic stretch could be investigated to design multiparametric stimuli . 139 Nonetheless , those dynamic platforms are using hydrogel - based substrates to assess material deformation . Therefore , the recom - mendation to wisely choose the appropriate material and stiffness range apply herein . The type and nature of polymer can modify the cell response and adhesion properties and may require additional coating to ensure proper cell anchorage and focal adhesion formation . G . Magnetic particle ( MNP ) to reproduce axon - traction force In a different ﬁeld , iron oxide ( Fe 3 O 4 ) magnetic nanoparticles ( MNPs ) are able to produce mechanical tension provoking axon elon - gation and growth . 140 , 141 Their use was proposed to potentially improve nerve regeneration and to implement guidance for regenerat - ing axons through cell magnetic actuation . 142 In order to develop novel functional nanotools , the MNPs could be used as an in vitro sys - tem assay to promote axonal elongation / growth by exploiting the mechanical forces that act on MNP - neurons and thus study remyeli - nation in co - culture platform with OL . IV . GLIAL MECHANOSENSORS Physical changes in the cell microenvironment , including ECM architecture , compression strain , shear stress or osmotic pressure , trig - ger cell adaptation according to the nature and magnitude of the mechanical signals . The integration , conversion and ampliﬁcation of these physical signals into biochemical signals are performed by the mechanotransduction process . Hence , mechanosensory systems are distributed over the cell membrane at the interface with the substrate ( integrin complexes ) or the extracellular ﬂuidic milieu ( stretched - acti - vated ion channels ) . These sensors work closely with the cytoskeletal network ( actomyosin ) , which are in turn connected with adaptor pro - teins that relay intracellular and nuclear signaling ( YAP ) and ulti - mately result in cell architecture changes and morphological adaptation . 58 , 143 Cell surface - ligand signaling ( integrin - ECM ) and the Hippo signaling pathway are well studied although many effectors are still to be conﬁrmed in their sequence of action and partners . Stretched - activated ion channels ( Piezo1 ) are the new kids on the block of glial mechanotransduction . Intraglial variations in preferred pathways have been demonstrated by recent works on Schwan cells 9 and oligodendrocytes . 10 , 59 RNA - seq transcriptome study recently showed that although the Hippo pathways effectors [ Large Tumor Suppressor Kinase ( LATS ) , Mammalian Ste20 - like Kinase ( MST ) ] are well preserved , YAP and TAZ expression highly varies across the glial cell types . 144 The identiﬁed glial mechanosensors and the underlying mechanotransduction pathways are described in this schematic repre - sentation ( Fig . 1 ) . Pharmacological inhibitors targeting key molecular actor in mechanotransduction pathway have been used in glial cells , including blebbistatin , 145 – 147 verteporﬁn , 9 , 112 , 125 GsMTX - 4 , 19 , 136 , 148 – 150 Y - 27632 , PP2 , PF - 573228 , C3 , and ML - 7 .

CURRENT LIMITATIONS A . CNS stiffness measurement In mechanobiology , the brain tissue stiffness is represented by the elastic moduli or the storage Young’s modulus , E , and can be mea - sured by indentation through atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) , 18 , 26 , 151 or by using magnetic resonance elastography ( MRE ) . 14 The latter is noninvasive and often used to assess human brain degeneration and mechanical alteration during aging . 27 Corrspondingly , the young adult brain displays a storage modulus of approximately 3 . 5kPa , while the aged brain possesses lower stiffness (cid:3) 2 . 5kPa . However , the resolution obtained by MRE is not always deﬁned enough to distinguish atrophic changes in brain geometry and may be subjected to mathematical errors . While AFM measurements are more accurate and , therefore , more widely used in testing animal brain stiffness , both methods must be put in perspective to optimize the comparison between studies . 24 Murine brain stiffness described in the literature exhibits a value approximately 20 times higher when measured by AFM 36 compared to the MRE technique . 37 Regional brain stiffness variation can reach a substantial amplitude . For example , whole rat brain stiffness measured with an indenter set with 25 l m diameter sphere at 1Hz and 5 % strain was found to be between 150 and 300Pa , 26 whereas the median stiff - ness of rat cortical sections was measured in a range between 50 and 500Pa by using 89 . 3 l m beads with a force of 20 – 30 nN . 17 Therefore , the selection of the tissue sampling method is an important approach to consider when establishing a study model . Particularly , gray and white matters have different permeability and ﬂuid volume content , which modiﬁes their mechanical signature and can alter the stiffness measurement depending on the method employed . For example , CNS TABLE VI . Pharmacological inhibitors of cell mechanotransduction used in glia .

Those studies could focus on brain stiffness calibration and direct comparison in vivo and ex vivo by using MRE and AFM could provide further insights to estab - lish regional tissue maps of the variations in mechanical rigidity within the CNS . B . 2D vs 3D engineered methods Although commonly used , 2D cell culture platforms have several disadvantages when it comes to encompassing physiological forces . To illustrate the lack of natural and physiological representation , the cellu - lar interaction model is greatly restricted by side - by - side linear contact , which sometimes results in cell ﬂattening presenting an altered mor - phology in contrast to their native behavior . Also , it is noteworthy that cells cultured in 2D will face a poor relevant cell - ECM interaction and that could lead to altered gene expression . Certainly one of the major drawbacks of classic 2D culture systems is the triggered glial immuno - reactivity due to dysregulated homeostasis generated by abnormal environment , especially for microglia and astrocytes . 105 Overall , the use of 2D models should be made for approaches that would target a speciﬁc type of interaction to be investigated in order to focus on the expected cellular responses and avoid false positives due to artiﬁcially grown culture conditions in order to minimize the risk of having a lack of predictive ability for in vivo events . In particular , when myeli - nating cells are cultured on 2D platforms , the cell body will generate mostly cell processes and spreading but will not achieve an entire membrane wrapping resulting in complete myelination that can be observed around axons . In contrast , the 3D modeling is particularly attractive because it reproduces more accurately the mechanical , but also structural and geometrical conditions that cells encounter in tissue . The matrix pro - teins deposited evenly on experimental substrates do not constitute an ideal reproduction of living organisms . Indeed , in humans , matrix ﬁbers exist at many scales of length , which is difﬁcult to model by 2D surface - based substrates . Finally , when a cell applies a tensile force on a compliant substrate attached to stiffer support , the resulting physical deformations are strongly localized and decrease exponentially with the distance from the point of application of the force . The range of deformations is related to the thickness of the substrate . 154 On the other hand , in the context of a 3D substrate , when a cell contracts on or within the matrix , the deformations extend over relatively long dis - tances and are approximately proportional to the inverse square of the distance from the cell . 132 In the absence of cross - linking , the tension applied to ﬁber is all along its length resulting from the nonlinear rhe - ological properties of the matrix . 155 – 157 Nevertheless , 3D platforms are not exempted from limitations . At the technical level , 3D culture sys - tems have a higher degree of complexity and thus generate higher costs and a higher demand for expertise and specialized equipment ( i . e . , bioreactor ) . Another major problem to consider is the difﬁculty of visualizing cells in a thick matrix with the usual microscopy techni - ques . Also , the difﬁculty to retrieve cells for further downstream analysis can be impaired by the nature and the structure of the system . Laser capture microdissection could be a response to this issue but remains marginally used 125 due to the difﬁculty to engineer a suitable system for speciﬁc cell collection . Therefore , the matrix features including opacity , biodegradability , pore size or stiffness have to be controlled . In particular , it is common that 3D models are prone to reproducibility defects and exposing great variability within their structure . It is therefore important to consider the most homogeneous distribution possible of the structure to allow an equal distribution of nutrients and biological factors to the cells in order to avoid areas of cellular necrosis . C . Glial cell culture model The observation of cellular phenomena is often carried out over relatively short periods ( days or weeks ) which could not correlate with the lengthy development of a pathology ( months up to years ) . Although , pathogenesis indeed arises over a long - term period , none - theless , mechanical changes materialize during a short time . Mechanotransduction is a rapid mechanism translating quick cell behavior change that trigger microenvironmental modiﬁcations possi - bly leading to signiﬁcant tissue alteration over a longer period . Hence , short - term studies based on single - cell or co - culture are still relevant to unravel speciﬁc cell mechanisms but one must remain cautious in extrapolating data toward more complex models of pathologies encompassing diverse topographies , matrix component , cell types and phenotypes . Glial cell cultures for in vitro studies are also limited to the avail - ability of cell type . While sampling mature glia from a living organism is ethically and technically limited , alternatives can be sought in study - ing organotypic culture on varying mechanical stimuli . 158 , 159 The CNS organoid development and the associated malformations can be observed in detail that comes closer to living conditions . However , the level of modeling of mechanical constraints is still sketchy and requires technological advances . Since all of the mechanotransduction plat - forms without exception have used animal cells , it would be now advisable to consider performing the same experiments with human cells in order to be in line with a development of a therapeutic strategy . Other research would be likely to use gene engineering such as induced pluripotent stem cell ( iPSC ) technology to induce glial cells - like phenotype from healthy and diseased available patient biopsy ( skin or fat mainly ) . This ﬁeld is promising and has demonstrated that functional glial cells could be obtained . 160 – 162 Human glia could be obtained at any level of commitment or maturation and similar mechanical constraints addressed with animal cells could be eventually assessed . For instance , we can envision that myelination ability of iPSC - derived OLs obtained from healthy and diseases patients ( for instance MS ) could compared on tunable stiffness artiﬁcial axon plat - form for drug discovery . VI . CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES Glial cells are mechanosensitive and their biological responses depend highly on extracellular mechanical features including the nature and stiffness of their substrate , as well as the applied stresses or strains . 38 , 143 Mechanical strain in the CNS can arise from several phys - iological or developmental mechanisms , such as tissue reorganization , ﬂuid ﬂow , and axon growth , as well as pathological events including axon swelling or mechanical trauma . During development , CNS tissue APL Bioengineering REVIEW scitation . org / journal / apb APL Bioeng . 5 , 021505 ( 2021 ) ; doi : 10 . 1063 / 5 . 0037814 5 , 021505 - 22 V C Author ( s ) 2021 stiffness changes induced by the microenvironment determine the cell morphology and lineage speciﬁcation . Mechanotransduction studies on cell - substrate interactions can aid design of neuro - glial micro - organs and tissue constructs ( Fig . 2 ) . Hence , glial commitment dem - onstrates sub cell type preferences for substrate stiffness . The mecha - nisms leading to cell differentiation and maturation are directly inﬂuenced by cell shape and morphology . Consequently , the interplay between biochemical and topographical cues is thus driving neuronal and glial cell differentiation . Therefore , the use of testing platforms for drug discoveries promises great advancements in pharmacotherapy of CNS disorders , speciﬁcally in the cases of remyelination strategies or astrogliosis prevention . Novel therapeutic targets and biomarkers are expected to be identiﬁed following the exploration of these mechano - circuits . As a result , the understanding of the signaling crosstalk between ECM mechanics , ﬂuid ﬂow and mechanosensitive ion chan - nels and their synchronization with paracrine factors to control glial , and more largely , neural cell lineage and behavior would aid in the medicine approaches against neurodegenerative disorders . Therefore , a better understanding of the mechanotransduction pathways involved can potentially identify critical biomolecules for controlling cell fate . Focusing on mechanotransduction signaling to identify speciﬁc key molecules as therapeutic target to modulate the glial behavior in dis - ease condition is part of the drug discovery strategy that can arise from those studies . Evidence , which reveals that the effects of drugs acting on the glial system can be inﬂuenced by the context of mechani - cal stiffness established by the disease , is beginning to emerge . By using tunable stiffness platform conjointly with verteporﬁn treatment , Ong et al . highlighted that oligodendrocyte differentiation and maturation may be two mechanisms independently and diversely regulated through the mechanosensory YAP signaling . 125 Thus , a number of molecules possess a therapeutic potential for the nervous system . Among these molecules , clemastine has shown potential in promoting the differentiation of oligodendrocytes and in aiding the remyelination in defective nervous ﬁbers in preclinical and clinical studies . 163 – 165 However , the results are not conclusive over the long term and the pharmacology has yet to be deepened . It is crucial that such molecules with therapeutic potential be tested in models taking into account the mechanical dimensions to evaluate their mode of action and optimize their beneﬁcial activities in order to design a future therapy . In addi - tion , mechanotransduction platforms should also be designed into high throughput devices to help identify new molecules , and this will require manufacturing standardization procedures . Speciﬁcally , no regenerative therapy is effective for the CNS now . In the past decades , several strategies have been used ; among them are the cell therapies including the local injection of pluripotent stem cells or mature cells . Nonetheless , cell therapies have often been disappoint - ing due to the poor cell viability . The design of biomaterials to pro - mote healing and regeneration in the nervous system via transplantation of glial progenitors or the implantation of tissue scaf - folds is justiﬁed . 64 Biomaterials can physically reproduce the CNS tis - sue and offer permissive environment for cell survival , growth , and differentiation . Promising results were obtained after the implantation of soft hydrogels at the injury site of CNS tissue which prevent glial scar formation and enabled neurite outgrowth . 131 However , serious improvements in biomaterial properties are required to extend cell survival and tissue integration . Particularly , the stiffness of the implant can trigger gliosis and inﬂammation . 166 Also , preserving a mechanical homeostasis is one of the greatest challenges of the current CNS cell FIG . 2 .
