Collabora - tors are likely to have their offices in another building , attend different conferences , and pub - lish in other venues ; they might speak a different scientific language and value an alien scientific culture . This paper presents a detailed analysis of success and failure of interdisci - plinary papers — as manifested in the citations they receive . For 9 . 2 million interdisciplinary research papers published between 2000 and 2012 we show that the majority ( 69 . 9 % ) of co - cited interdisciplinary pairs are “ win - win ” relationships , i . e . , papers that cite them have higher citation impact and there are as few as 3 . 3 % “ lose - lose ” relationships . Papers citing references from subdisciplines positioned far apart ( in the conceptual space of the UCSD map of science ) attract the highest relative citation counts . The findings support the as - sumption that interdisciplinary research is more successful and leads to results greater than the sum of its disciplinary parts . Introduction Long - distance relationships are tough . Scholarly collaborations across disparate scientific disci - plines are even more challenging : Collaborators are likely to have their offices in another build - ing , attend different conferences , and publish in other venues ; they might speak a different scientific language and value an alien scientific culture . Over the last 20 years , interdisciplinarity has remained a hot topic in science policy [ 1 – 3 ] . Interdisciplinary is formed through problems , it is thus aimed at application , and can be defined as the combination of methods , theories and data of distinct disciplines to ideally derive a result that is greater than the sum of its parts [ 4 ] . As it is often taken for granted that it is a fruitful enterprise , governments and international organi - zations have pushed towards interdisciplinary research [ 5 , 6 ] . However , previous research pro - vided conflicting evidence on its effect on the impact of research . For instance , at the level of research groups , Rinia , van Leeuwen and van Raan showed , using the percentage of papers pub - lished outside of physics as a measure of Dutch physicists ’ interdisciplinarity , that interdisciplin - ary programs had lower impact ( raw citations and raw impact factors ) than programs that were PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0122565 March 30 , 2015 1 / 15 OPEN ACCESS Citation : Larivière V , Haustein S , Börner K ( 2015 ) Long - Distance Interdisciplinarity Leads to Higher Scientific Impact .

Funding : This research was funded by the Fonds Recherche Québec – Société et Culture , the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada and the Canada Research Chairs program . The funders had no role in study design , data at the ‘ core ’ of physics [ 7 ] . Applying relative impact indicators , the differences in impact between the groups were , however , lower . At the level of journals , Levitt and Thelwall provided evidence that , in the natural and medical sciences , papers published in journals to which more than one disciplinary classification had been assigned obtain fewer citations than papers published in strictly disciplinary journals [ 8 ] . Adams , Jackson , and Marshall calculated for 37 , 000 papers from two UK universities , the percentage of references made to journals published in disciplines other than that of the citing paper and found that interdisciplinary papers were not cited more than the ‘ average ’ paper , and that highly - cited papers were not the most interdisciplinary ones [ 9 ] . Also at the level of individual papers and using the percentage of references made to journals of a different discipline , Larivière and Gingras showed that , for some disciplines — such as bio - medical research — an increase in interdisciplinarity was associated with a decrease in citations [ 10 ] . For some other disciplines , a moderate interdisciplinarity was associated with an increase in impact . In all disciplines , however , papers with very high or very low interdisciplinarity ob - tained fewer citations ; a finding which has recently been corroborated by Yegros - Yegros et al . at the level of research groups [ 11 ] . Larivière and Gingras ’ [ 10 ] results also show that the relation - ship between interdisciplinarity and impact was “ highly determined by the citation characteris - tics of the disciplines involved , as articles citing citation - intensive disciplines are more likely to be cited by those disciplines and , hence , obtain higher citation rates than are articles citing non - citation - intensive disciplines ” ( p . 131 ) . This has important consequences on the interpretation given to the relation between citations and interdisciplinarity , as it shows that the disciplines in - volved and their citation dynamics can influence the scientific impact of interdisciplinary rela - tionships [ 10 ] . Recent work by Uzzi et al . rates the novelty of journal pairs in reference lists equate it with a possible novelty of results presented in the paper , and correlate it with the ulti - mate citation - impact of papers [ 12 ] . They find that novel combinations , when interjected with otherwise conventional combinations , yield increases in impact . Similarly , Klavans and Boyack [ 13 ] showed , using clusters of papers rather than disciplines , that the impact of citing papers in - creases with the topical distance of the papers they cite . Despite these numerous analyses , the effect of long - distance interdisciplinarity on the im - pact of research remains open to debate . Similarly , while the relationships between disciplines have been extensively mapped and visualized [ 14 – 16 ] , these are typically made to assess their intensity rather than their effect on the scientific impact ( citations ) of citing papers . This paper , thus , aims to measure and visualize subdiscipline distances and linkages to answer the follow - ing questions : What are the ( sub ) disciplines that increase impact when cited together ? To the opposite , what are the interdisciplinary combinations that are associated with a decrease in ci - tations ? The visualization of these interdisciplinary combinations and their effect on the impact of papers will shed light on the network of ( sub ) disciplines that have a positive effect on the im - pact the papers citing them . This analysis is limited to the scientific impact of interdisciplinary research , as measured by citations received . Other types of impacts which interdisciplinary re - search may have on education , industry practice or society , health or the economy at large are not measured here . The results nonetheless shed light on the impact of interdisciplinary rela - tionships in the scientific community , and may trigger more analyses — either quantitative or qualitative — on what it is exactly in these combinations of disciplines that result in highly cited research . This , in turn , can have significant implications for research policy and institutional planning .

Competing Interests : The authors have declared that no competing interests exist . Results Number of subdisciplines cited and citation rates The relative citation rate — both in terms of average and media — of papers increases with the number of subdisciplines they cite , supporting the perceived success of interdisciplinarity ( Fig 1 , panels A and B ) . At citation impact below the expected number of citations of papers published in the same subdiscipline at the same year , strictly disciplinary papers , i . e . , those cit - ing papers from one subdiscipline only , obtain the lowest citation rates ( 0 . 66 ) . These disciplin - ary papers make up 17 . 2 % of all papers in the WoS . Papers citing 3 subdisciplines or less obtain a mean impact below world average ( 47 . 3 % of all papers ) , while papers citing 4 subdisciplines ( 11 . 5 % of all papers ) obtain a mean citation rate that is on a par with the mean impact of papers published the same year in the same subdiscipline . On average , citation rates exceeding the Fig 1 .

A similar trend is observed for the median — although the impact values are lower , as they are less likely to be influenced by a few highly cited papers . Citation impact of interdisciplinary combinations The mean relative citation rate of all interdisciplinary subdiscipline pairs included in this study is 1 . 54 . Out of all 161 , 994 interdisciplinary subdiscipline pairs , 69 . 9 % are win - win relation - ships , 26 . 8 % increased impact for one of the subdisciplines , and only 3 . 3 % do not exceed ex - pected citation rates in any of the two subdisciplines ( Fig 2 ) . Note that the majority of interdisciplinary papers are win - win — this is due to the fact that strictly disciplinary pairs typi - cally have an impact below average , as well as to the various interdisciplinary pairs having dif - ferent numbers of papers . With 85 % win - win pairs , interdisciplinary relationships by and with subdisciplines from Chemistry are most often beneficial , followed by Brain Research ( 78 . 8 % ) and Biology ( 76 . 9 % ) . Most lose - lose relationships occur with subdisciplines in the Humanities ( 11 . 2 % ) and Electrical Engineering & Computer Science ( 7 . 3 % ) . From the perspective of a par - ticular discipline , the Humanities are by far benefiting most from interdisciplinary pairs but Fig 2 .

In terms of beneficial combinations , interdisciplinary co - citations that include subdisciplines from Biotechnology , Chemistry and Brain Research are most often suc - cessful as respectively 97 . 0 % , 96 . 4 % and 96 . 4 % of all subdisciplinary combinations are either a win - win or lose - win , i . e . , the citation impact of both or of the co - cited subdiscipline increased . Distinguishing between intradisciplinary , i . e . , pairs of two subdisciplines belonging to the same discipline , and truly interdisciplinary pairs , the most interdisciplinary win - win pairs are in Chemistry ( 77 . 7 % ) and Biotechnology ( 73 . 2 % ) , while Brain Research ( 16 . 0 % ) , Chemical , Me - chanical , & Civil Engineering ( 12 . 9 % ) and Medical Specialties ( 12 . 6 % ) show the highest per - centages of intradisciplinary win - win pairs . Citation impact and topical distance The mean relative citation rate of co - cited interdisciplinary pairs constantly increases with the distance between them ( Table 1 and Table 2 ) . Category A , which contains co - cited subdisci - pline pairs closest to each other in the UCSD map — in fact 71 . 4 % of the pairs in this category were assigned to the same discipline — has both the lowest citation rate ( 1 . 26 ) and lowest share of win - win pairs ( 62 . 4 % ) , while category J , which at a mean distance of 205 contains the topi - cally least related subdiscipline pairs was on average cited 72 % above average . Except for dis - tance categories A and J , the percentages of win - win relationships are quite stable at around 71 % . This suggests that the increase in citation impact is not caused by an increase in the num - ber of win - win pairs but rather by an actual growth of relative citation impact as distance in - creases . In other words , the probability of an interdisciplinary relationship increasing a paper ’ s relative citations in relation to both subdisciplines is similar across distance groups B to J but impact intensifies with greater distance . However , both medians ( 1 . 48 – 1 . 50 ) and standard de - viations ( 0 . 79 to 0 . 97 ) of categories G to J suggest that the increasing citation rates in these four groups are less due to an overall increase but mainly due to a few highly cited pairs ( Table 2 ) .

For example , in Electrical Engineering & Computer Science , relative citation rates increase from category A ( 1 . 25 ) to F ( 2 . 42 ) , after which they show a decrease in G to I to reach 2 . 46 in J . Earth Sciences also shows a tendency of increasing citation impact with distance to the co - cited subdiscipline from 1 . 27 in distance category A to 1 . 52 in J with the exception of impact dropping in D ( 1 . 24 ) and H ( 1 . 34 ) .

It should , however , be noted that for none of the 13 disciplines impact decreases with increasing distance . Table 3 shows the number and percentages of win - win and lose - lose relationships of inter - disciplinarity pairs in the UCSD map of science . Thus it highlights where the most successful and unsuccessful combinations of co - cited subdisciplines are located in the landscape of scien - tific disciplines . Relationships which involve one winner and one loser ( win - lose , lose - win ) are not shown . On average , the percentage of win - win relationships is highest in Chemistry ( mean : 85 . 0 % ; std . dev . : 6 . 9 % ) and Brain Research ( 78 . 4 % ; 12 . 6 % ) and lowest in the Humanities ( 35 . 0 % ; 23 . 0 % ) and Social Sciences ( 50 . 4 % ; 13 . 9 % ) , which is likely a consequence of the lower citation density of those disciplines . On the lose - lose side , Nursing Theory ( Medical Specialties ) was involved in the most lose - lose relationships , both in absolute ( 62 lose - loses ) and relative ( 19 . 6 % ) terms and the Humanities ( 23 . 7 % ; 26 . 5 % ) are involved in the most lose - lose relation - ships , on average . Subdisciplines associated with Biotechnology had , on average , the lowest share of lose - lose pairs ( 1 . 1 % ; 1 . 1 % ) , which clearly suggests that its multiple application to life sciences , pharmacology , agriculture or engineering is beneficial to all subdisciplines involved . Mapping interdisciplinarity The heat map ( Fig 4 ) visualizes the citation impact of all 80 , 997 occurring subdiscipline pairs s 1 - s 2 from the perspectives of both s 1 ( row ) and s 2 ( column ) . For example , the majority of red cells in the Social Sciences ( row ) > Brain Research ( column ) field indicate that these interdisci - plinary connections are mostly beneficial relative to expected citation rates in the Social Sci - ences , while the large number of blue cells in the Brain Research ( row ) > Social Sciences ( column ) field shows that from the perspective of Brain Research , many of these pairs do not result in high citation impact . The majority of red cells in the matrix reflects the overall success of interdisciplinary pairs . The heat map also highlights where interdisciplinary relationships do not deviate much from expected citation rates or do not appear at all ( white color coding ) , for example between the Humanities and Chemical , Mechanical , & Civil Engineering .

The most frequently co - cited win - win pair is Protein Science ( Biotechnology ) and Clinical Cancer Research ( Brain Research ) , which occurred in 562 , 384 citing papers and focuses , among other topics , on the genetic basis of cancer . Lose - lose relationships appear much less frequently and often between subdisciplines belonging to distant disciplines . The most frequently occurring lose - lose pair is Food Engineering ( Biotech - nology ) and Food Chemistry ( Chemistry ) ( 52 , 342 papers cite works from these two disciplines ) . The node size in A1 and B1 indicates the number of win - win and lose - lose relationships for particular subdisciplines . The “ biggest winners ” and “ biggest losers ” of interdisciplinarity are labeled for each discipline . Comparing A1 and B1 , it can be seen that the number of wins are less skewed and more equally distributed across the science map than the number of losses . The subdiscipline with the most win - win relationships in absolute numbers is Molecular Ecolo - gy ( Biology ; 409 win - wins , 81 . 2 % of all its interdisciplinarity relationships ) . However , Material Science ( Chemical , Mechanical , & Civil Engineering ; 387 ; 91 . 9 % ) obtained more win - wins as a percentage of all its interdisciplinarity combinations ( Table 3 ) . Node size in A2 / B2 and A3 / B3 indicates the mean citation rate of all outgoing ( A2 / B2 ) and incoming ( A3 / B3 ) pairs . As such , the maps show which subdisciplines gain and lose . While the mean of outgoing citation links ( mean of s 1 - s n for s 1 ) highlights recipients of impact , the mean of incoming links ( mean of s n - s 1 for s 1 ) marks the donors , who provide most positive ( win - win ) or negative ( lose - lose ) impact to the co - cited subdiscipline . As shown in A2 , the greatest recipients of win - win relationships belong to the Humanities , Electrical Engineering & Comput - er Science and Math & Physics , with Art History ( mean incoming relative citation rate : 10 . 23 ) and Biblical Literature ( 8 . 02 ) benefiting the most . Donors are more equally distributed and ap - pear in different disciplines with Industrial Chemistry ( 2 . 80 ) , Biotechnology Trends ( 2 . 67 ) and Bulk Solid Handling ( 2 . 66 ) providing on average the highest citation rates to the co - cited sub - discipline . On the lose - lose side , the picture on the disciplinary level is reversed : Recipients of highest lose - lose relationships are equally distributed with Modern Language ( mean incoming relative citation rate : 0 . 37 = 63 % below expectations ) , Gut ( 0 . 41 ) , Neurophysiology & Neurosci - ence ( 0 . 42 ) and Diabetes Metabolism ( 0 . 43 ) losing most . Donors of lose - lose , i . e . , negative im - pact , are mostly concentrated in the Humanities , Electrical Engineering & Computer Science as well as Math & Physics with Medieval History ( 0 . 17 ) and Modern Language ( 0 . 22 ) losing most when co - cited with another subdiscipline . Maps A4 and B4 highlight the strongest connections between two subdisciplines in terms of relative citation rates . In A4 , arcs with a citation rate of 5 . 0 and higher are shown , while B4 de - picts citation impact of 0 . 5 and lower , i . e . , 50 % below expectations . Node size indicates the number of win - win and lose - lose relationships and is thus identical to A1 and B1 . Arcs move clock - wise from source to target and are colored according to the source . For each discipline , the strongest outgoing connection is labeled . The highest relative citation rate is obtained by Child Abuse when co - cited with Leukemia ( 27 . 53 ) and the lowest impact by Pragmatics & Dis - course when co - cited with Modern Language ( 0 . 09 ) . It can be seen that the strongest win - win combinations ( links ) are between the Social Sciences to Brain Research ( e . g . , Child Abuse to Leukemia , 27 . 53 ) , Brain Research to Earth Sciences ( e . g . , Thoracic Surgery to Air Quality , 27 . 22 ) , Social Sciences and Medical Specialties ( e . g . , Child Abuse to Otolyngology , Head Neck , 22 . 98 ) , and Medical Specialties to Earth Sciences ( e . g . , Otolyngology , Head Neck to Air Quality , 17 . 08 ) and Brain Research ( e . g . , Psychiatric Nursing to Vascular Surgery , 15 . 36 ) , while the strongest lose - lose links are within the Social Sciences and Humanities ( e . g . , Pragmatics & Dis - course to Modern Language , 0 . 09 or Ethics to Medieval History , 0 . 11 ) but also range across the network such as from Earth Sciences ( Glaciology ) to Chemical , Mechanical , & Civil Engineering Interdisciplinarity and Impact PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0122565 March 30 , 2015 10 / 15 ( Transportation Research , 0 . 21 ) or Chemical , Mechanical , & Civil Engineering ( Dyes & Pig - ments ) to Social Sciences ( Marketing , 0 . 25 ) . Discussion and Conclusion Since the 1980s , interdisciplinary relationships have increased [ 17 ] , likely because of “ govern - ment programs and discourses promoting interdisciplinarity as a good thing in itself ” ( pp . 197 – 198 ) . Our results provide evidence that , on the whole , interdisciplinarity research , as measured by co - citation links , is beneficial , as the majority of co - cited interdisciplinary pairs benefit in terms of citation impact , and as few as 3 . 3 % of represent losses for both subdisci - plines involved . While most win - win relations are associated with disciplines related to medi - cine , most lose - lose relationships are associated with disciplines that typically have lower citation rates , such as computer science and engineering , social sciences and the humanities . This might also be due to the lower coverage of literature published in these domains , which often appears in non - journal literature ( conference proceedings , books , etc . ) . Topical distance has a positive effect on scientific impact in the natural sciences and social sciences and to a lesser extent in medical disciplines . This might be caused by several factors , two of which are discussed here . First , combining methods and perspectives from multiple dis - ciplines might be able to solve scientific problems or social issues that are more complex and that one discipline alone cannot solve [ 4 ] . Second , different subdisciplines have diverse intrin - sic citation dynamics . As shown by Larivière and Gingras [ 10 ] , papers ’ citation rates are influ - enced by the disciplines they cite : a humanities paper citing papers in medicine is likely to obtain higher - than - average citations compared to other humanities papers , while a medical paper citing papers in humanities is likely to experience the opposite faith . This would explain why the humanities , as well as other low citation count disciplines , are more often involved in lose - lose and win - lose relationships . Materials and Methods Disciplines and subdisciplines were assigned to journals using the UCSD map and classifica - tion system of science [ 18 ] . This classification covers 10 years ( 2001 – 2010 ) of WoS data and 8 years ( 2001 – 2008 ) of Scopus data and fractionally matches about 25 , 000 journal and other source titles to 13 disciplines and 554 subdisciplines using a combination of bibliographic cou - pling and keyword co - occurrences as similarity measures on journal level . The distance be - tween two subdisciplines is calculated using the x - y positions of the 554 subdisciplines on the UCSD map . Note that this map wraps around a cylinder , i . e . , the left most nodes are connected to the nodes on the far right . The cylinder circumference is 624 and the maximum distance is half of this : 312 . The distances for the 153 , 181 subdiscipline pairs range from 0 . 63 to 294 . 32 . This study uses a definition of interdisciplinarity based on cited references . An interdisci - plinary relationship between 2 of the 554 UCSD subdisciplines exists , if two papers from these subdisciplines are cited together in a third paper . Co - citations measure the contextual similari - ty between two references [ 19 ] as “ the degree of relationship or association between papers as perceived by the population of citing authors ” ( p . 265 ) . If aggregated on the level of scientific disciplines and subdisciplines , it thus reflects the combination of resources from different ( sub ) disciplines by the authors of the paper . Co - cited subdiscipline pairs were extracted from the reference lists of citing papers using a binary approach , i . e . , counting each pair once per citing paper , irrespective of the number of papers associated with the particular subdiscipline in the reference lists of the citing paper . Hence , if a paper A cited five references in ophthalmology , three in astrophysics , and ten in zoology , then three co - citation links were created based on paper A : ophthalmology - astrophysics , ophthalmology - zoology and astrophysics - zoology . The Interdisciplinarity and Impact PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0122565 March 30 , 2015 11 / 15 frequency of occurring subdiscipline pairs equals the number of papers co - citing papers from the two particular subdisciplines . Each co - cited interdisciplinarity pair was assigned its distance on the UCSD map to represent its topical proximity . Pairs were grouped into 10 categories of distances ( A - J ) with a comparable number of pairs in each category . The dataset used in this paper is drawn from Thomson Reuters ’ WoS database , including the Science Citation Index Expanded ( SCIE ) , the Social Sciences Citation Index ( SSCI ) and the Arts and Humanities Citation Index ( AHCI ) . It comprises 11 . 1 million papers ( articles and re - views ) published between January 1 , 2000 and December 31 , 2012 and their cited references matched to the UCSD classification system via journal name . Only references from this period were considered , as the UCSD classification system builds on 2000 - onwards publications . This leads to a lower proportion of references covered for the older years , and to a higher proportion for the more recent ones . Given that the analysis is based on the entire 13 - year period instead on an annual basis , the different coverage of the specific years should not affect the results . Ref - erences were linked to their record as a source item using Thomson ’ s ItemID _ ref as well as in - house matching using the first author , publication year , volume number , and page number . The match of cited references with the source item allows assigning a discipline and subdisci - pline to each cited reference . We excluded the 40 journals that are fractionally assigned to more than one UCSD subdiscipline to avoid artificially creating subdisciplinary pairs due to double classification . Based on this assignment , a paper is defined as interdisciplinary if it con - tains references from more than one subdiscipline . 17 . 2 % of the 11 million papers in the data - base cited references of one subdiscipline only . On the whole , 70 . 0 % of all references made were matched to source items indexed in the WoS , 45 . 8 % of which were published in the period analyzed . A total of 138 , 657 , 550 or 32 . 1 % of all cited references were matched to a UCSD subdiscipline and were taken into account for the calculation of citation impact of co - cited interdisciplinary pairs . The percentage of references matched to source items and published between 2000 and 2012 varied among disciplines , given the different use of journal literature [ 20 , 21 ] and age of references . The percentage of ref - erences made to WoS - indexed items was highest in Biotechnology ( 84 . 6 % ) and lowest in Hu - manities ( 7 . 0 % ) on the level of disciplines and if limited to the publication years under analysis , highest in Infectious Diseases ( 39 . 9 % ) and Brain Research ( 39 . 6 % ) and lowest in Social Sciences ( 16 . 9 % ) and in the Humanities ( 2 . 4 % ) . At the higher end of the spectrum for subdisciplines , more than 50 % of references were matched with a source item and published between 2000 and 2012 in Molecular Biology Methods ( 56 . 2 % ) , Nanotechnology ( 54 . 8 % ) , Proteomics ( 54 . 1 % ) , Cancer ( translated ; 54 . 0 % ) and Clinical Medicine ( translated ; 52 . 15 ) , while this percentage re - mained below 1 % in Literary Criticism , Hispanic Studies , Italian Studies , Art History , Textile Art , Medieval History , and Modern Language . The final dataset of interdisciplinary papers contained a total of 9 , 166 , 710 papers and their cited references matched to a UCSD subdiscipline . All unique subdiscipline pairs ( see binary definition above ) were extracted from each of the papers . A threshold of 30 co - citing papers at the level of subdisciplines during the 2000 – 2012 publication period was applied to assure a minimum robustness of citation rates . Of the 153 , 181 possible pairs of the 554 UCSD subdisci - plines , 80 , 997 ( 52 . 9 % ) were co - cited by at least 30 papers 179 million times amounting to a mean number of 2 , 214 co - citing papers per subdiscipline pair . As to be expected , the number of co - cited papers per interdisciplinary pair is positively skewed and the average number of co - citations per pair decreases continuously per distance categories A to J , i . e . , the more distant the two disciplines the smaller the number of co - citing papers . Two normalization methods are performed in this paper . A first one , which is used in Fig 1 , takes the subdiscipline ( and year ) of the journal in which the paper is published as the denomi - nator , and then divides each paper ’ s observed number of citations by this expected value . In Interdisciplinarity and Impact PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0122565 March 30 , 2015 12 / 15 this case , each paper only has one normalized citation rate , and a clear zero - sum game at level of all paper is observed . A second one , used to measure the impact of interdisciplinary relation - ships , is performed at the level of the paper and subdiscipline combination . In this case , each pair obtained two relative , i . e . , observed vs . expected , citation scores normalized by the average citation rates of all papers — interdisciplinary or not — that cited each of the two subdisciplines . Citations of each citing paper were counted from for the entire period studied , 2000 – 2013 . This normalization procedure was applied to account for the fact that the citation impact of in - terdisciplinary papers depends on the citation potential of the involved subdisciplines [ 10 ] . The impact of a paper p co - citing subdisciplines s 1 and s 2 needs to be calculated in the citation context of both s 1 and s 2 separately . The observed citation score of s 1 – s 2 represents the citation score of p . The expected citation rates for each co - cited subdiscipline are based on the citation rate of all papers citing the particular subdiscipline in the same publication year to normalize for age . In this normalization approach , the expected citations of the subdiscipline are defined by its direct citation environment . For subdisciplines s 1 and s 2 co - cited by paper p in year y , the expected citation rate of subdiscipline s 1 is thus the average citation rate of all papers citing sub - discipline s 1 in year y . The relative citation rate of the interdisciplinary pair s 1 – s 2 relative to s 1 equals the average of all observed vs . average ratios on the document level of all co - citing pa - pers in all years , conforming to the average - of - ratio method [ 22 ] . The relative citation rate of the interdisciplinary pair s 1 – s 2 relative to s 1 is based on the expected citations for s 1 . Two dis - tinct relative citation rates were computed for the 80 , 997 occurring subdiscipline pairs , result - ing in an asymmetric matrix with 161 , 994 relative citation rates . Thus , each co - cited pair s 1 – s 2 obtained two distinct observed vs . expected citation rates , normalized by the citation rates of papers that cited the subdiscipline s 1 and s 2 , respectively , in the same year . Based on the pair - wise comparison of the relative citation rates of co - cited subdisciplines , the success of interdis - ciplinary relationships was defined as win - win , win - lose / lose - win and lose - lose citation outcomes . If , on average , papers co - citing subdiscipline pair s 1 – s 2 were cited above expectations in both s 1 and s 2 the interdisciplinary relationship s 1 – s 2 was defined as a win - win relationship in terms of observed vs . expected citation impact , while a lose - lose situation was at hand if it did not exceed expected citation impact in both s 1 and s 2 . If citation impact was above expecta - tions compared to s 1 but below average compared to s 2 or below s 1 and above s 2 , the interdisci - plinary relationship s 1 – s 2 was defined as a win - lose or lose - win connection , respectively , see Fig 6 and examples therein . While a zero - sum can be obtained here at the level of paper and cited subdisciplines combinations , it cannot be observed for subdiscipline pairs , as papers cit - ing n subdisciplines appear n 2 - n times ( because the diagonal is empty ) and each subdiscipline pair is based on a different number of papers . While the first normalization method is used to show the scientific impact of papers citing a certain number of subdisciplines ( i . e . level of inter - disciplinarity ) , the second is used to assess the scientific impact co - cited subdisciplines . Success of interdisciplinarity in terms of citation impact is visualized using a heat map ( Fig 4 ) and network graphs ( Fig 5 ) . The heat map shows the mean relative citation impact of subdiscipline pairs , i . e . , each cell of the matrix represents the mean relative citation impact of a particular pair . The asymmetrical square matrix contains 554 rows and columns representing the subdisciplines of the classification , which are grouped according to the 13 superordinate disciplines . Cells representing subdiscipline pairs with citation rates above world average are indicated by shades of red , those below by shades of blue , while citation rates close to world av - erage are colored in white . About half of the matrix cells remain empty because the respective interdisciplinary pair did not meet the threshold of 30 co - citing papers or they were strictly dis - ciplinary ( i . e . , the diagonal of the matrix ) . The empty cells are also colored in white and can thus not be distinguished from cells with citation impact close to world average . Hence , the Interdisciplinarity and Impact PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0122565 March 30 , 2015 13 / 15 heat map highlights the winners and losers of interdisciplinary relationships from the perspec - tive of both s 1 and s 2 . While the heat map ( Fig 4 ) represents the 161 , 994 observed vs . expected citation impacts of interdisciplinary relationships of subdiscipline pairs , the win - win and lose - lose relationships with the highest citation impact are visualized in the UCSD map of science ( Fig 5 ) in order to show which interdisciplinary combinations are most successful and to communicate the dis - tances of the subdisciplines involved , see Fig 5 A4 and B4 .
