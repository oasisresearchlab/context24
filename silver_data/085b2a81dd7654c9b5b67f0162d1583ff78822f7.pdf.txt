Here polyacrylamide gel materials are examined using different techniques ( indentation , unconfined compression , dynamic mechanical analysis ) at different length - scales and considering both viscoelastic and poroelastic mechanical frameworks . Elastic modulus values were similar for nanoindentation and microindentation , but both indentation techniques overestimated elastic modulus values compared with homogeneous loading techniques . Hydraulic and intrinsic permeability values from microindentation tests , deconvoluted using a poroelastic finite element model , were consistent with literature values for gels of the same composition . Although elastic modulus values were comparable for viscoelastic and poroelastic analyses , time - dependent behavior was length - scale dependent , supporting the use of a poroelastic , instead of a viscoelastic , framework for future studies of gel mechanical behavior under indentation .

INTRODUCTION Nanoindentation has become a common technique for characterizing the mechanical properties of a wide range of materials , including materials with time - dependent mechanical behavior such as polymers [ 1 ] and biological materials [ 2 ] . Until recently , the majority of nanoindentation studies concerning biological tissues were on stiff , hard mineralized tissues , and most samples were dehydrated for testing . An increasing interest in compliant , soft and hydrated materials has driven the development of new techniques for expanding nanoindentation to new experimentally challenging materials sets . Both hydrated soft tissues and hydrated gel materials have been the subjects of recent nanoindentation investigations . Time - dependent mechanical behavior is a critical aspect of the mechanical response in many compliant and hydrated materials . Early nanoindentation studies emphasized time - independent , elastic - plastic material responses but many recent studies have incorporated viscoelastic [ 3 - 7 ] or viscous - elastic - plastic [ 8 , 9 ] material models . Linearly viscoelastic material characterization is now well - developed for nanoindentation studies on glassy and rubbery polymers , and such analysis has been used ( with caveats ) for characterizing time - dependent nanoindentation creep responses in hydrated bone [ 10 , 11 ] and indentation load - relaxation responses in soft biological tissues [ 12 , 13 ] . A similar analysis based on linear viscoelasticity has also been used recently for nanoindentation load - relaxation in hydrated gel materials [ 14 ] . Several open questions remain in the viscoelastic literature that are relevant in developing novel mechanical characterization paradigms for hydrated compliant materials . One question concerns the utility of time - domain [ 3 - 14 ] versus frequency domain [ 15 - 17 ] nanoindentation measurements for best - practice mechanical characterization of time - dependent materials . A second question concerns the appropriateness of viscoelastic material models for gels or hydrated tissues , as the behavior of a fluid - saturated porous solid is more appropriately described by poroelasticity [ 18 , 19 ] than viscoelasticity [ 20 ] . A recent study examined poroelastic data analysis for bone and demonstrated some promise for identification of hydraulic permeability values from nanoindentation data [ 21 ] .

Both nanoindentation and microindentation load - relaxation studies were performed on gels of two different nominal thicknesses . Data were examined in both viscoelastic and poroelastic mechanical frameworks . Results were compared with two sets of compression tests on the same gels but emphasizing frequency - domain measurements and including dynamic mechanical analysis ( DMA ) . Time - domain indentation relaxation results were converted to storage modulus for comparison with the compression results . 2 . MATERIALS AND EXPERIMENTAL METHODS 2 . 1 Materials Polyacrylamide gels were synthesized with 20 % acrylamide following established recipes . Briefly , the gels were created by the addition of initiators ( ammonium persulfate and tetramethylethylenediamine ( TEMED ) ) to a 30 % ( w / v ) acrylamide stock solution with a 19 : 1 acrylamide to bis - acrylamide ratio ( Severn Biotech Ltd . , Kidderminster , Worcs , UK ) . Gels were cast into two thicknesses ( l ) , nominally 2 mm and 5 mm thick and left 24 hours prior to being removed from original casting plates and submerged in distilled water . Gels were kept hydrated by storage in distilled water with water changes approximately every 48 hours until the time of testing . Dehydration profiles were established by weighing the samples as they air dried ; no change of mass was found in the first hour after removal from the bath , and thus tests undertaken in non - submerged conditions were conducted no more than 60 minutes after removal of the gels from the storage bath . Air - dehydrated gels were dehydrated in ambient conditions at least 24 hours prior to testing . Ethanol - dehydrated gels were soaked in ethanol baths for 24 hours prior to testing . 2 . 2 Indentation Tests Nanoindentation tests were performed in displacement - control on a UBI nanoindenter ( Hysitron , Inc . , Minneapolis , MN ) using the “manual method” for surface determination and test engagement [ 14 ] . A spherical alumina indenter tip with a 400 µm Page 4 of 22 Journal of Materials Research 1234567891011121314151617181920 21 222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960 F o r P e e r R e v i e w Page 5 of 22 radius was used for all tests . A ramp - hold displacement - time profile was used with a 5 or 10 second ramp time and a 20 - 30 s hold time for each test . Peak displacements for nanoindentation ranged from 1 to 3 . 5 µm . Microindentation tests were conducted on an Instron 5544 ( Canton , MA ) under similar ramp - hold conditions with a 10 s ramp time and a 300 s hold time , and peak displacements from 100 to 500 µm in thin gels and 100 µm to 1 mm in thick gels . The indenter tip was stainless steel and had a 1 . 5 mm radius ; a 5 N load cell was used for data collection . Indentation data for both nanoindentation and microindentation were analyzed with an approximate solution for spherical indentation load - relaxation based on elastic - viscoelastic correspondence as presented previously [ 12 ] . Briefly , load - time data were fit ( nonlinear curve fit wizard , Origin 8 , OriginLab , Northampton , MA ) to an exponential decay function of the form : P ( t ) = B ∞ + B D exp ( - t / τ 1 ) ( Eqn . 1 ) which was derived assuming the extensional relaxation function for a standard linear solid ( Figure 1 ) where the single time - constant exponential decay can be written E ( t ) = E ∞ + E D exp ( - t / τ ) ( Eqn . 2 ) and where the time constant is related to the viscosity and dashpot - associated modulus by τ = η / E 1 . The parameters E ∞ and E D were simply calculated from the fitting parameters B ∞ and B D ( assuming ν = 0 . 5 ) by [ 12 ] : E ! = B ! h max3 / 2 ( 16 R / 9 ) ( Eqn . 3 ) and E D = B D ( RCF ) h max3 / 2 ( 16 R / 9 ) , ( Eqn . 4 ) where RCF = ! t R exp t R ! ( ) " 1 # $ % & ’ ( ( Eqn . 5 ) E ∞ is the equilibrium modulus while the instantaneous modulus is given by the sum E ∞ + E D ; the elastic fraction is f E = E ( ∞ ) / E ( 0 ) = E ∞ / ( E ∞ + E D ) .

An oscillatory saw tooth displacement profile with a peak to peak displacement of 0 . 3 mm was used to compress the sample at a range of frequencies from 0 . 01 Hz to 8 Hz . A preload of 3 N was applied to ensure that the sample was held in compression throughout the duration of the test . The raw force , F ( t ) , and displacement , u ( t ) , time series data were converted into the frequency domain , F ( ω ) and u ( ω ) , using a fast Fourier transform . The complex modulus of the sample was calculated as : E * = F ( ! ) " l u ( ! ) " A ( Eqn . 6 ) where l is the sample height and A is the surface area of the sample ; the real part of E * corresponds to the storage modulus E ' and the imaginary part to the loss modulus E ' ' . 2 . 4 DMA tests Dynamic Mechanical Analysis ( DMA ) in compression was undertaken on circular cylindrical samples of diameter 18 mm and thickness nominally 5 mm using a DMA machine ( Q800 , TA Instruments , Newcastle , DE ) . The samples were oscillated up to a peak displacement of 5µm over a frequency range of 1 – 200 Hz . Following the findings of Yamashita [ 22 ] a pilot study was undertaken to determine an appropriate static preload of 8 . 5 N , which gave stable measurements of the complex modulus . During the main compression testing it was noted that at each given frequency a settling time of approximately one minute was required to achieve a stable measurement of the compression storage modulus , E ' and loss modulus , E ' ' . 2 . 5 Comparisons for time - and frequency domains Comparisons were made between indentation and unconfined compression tests by converting the indentation creep function data to storage modulus ( E ' ) and loss tangent ( tan δ ) via [ 20 ] : Page 6 of 22 Journal of Materials Research 1234567891011121314151617181920 21 222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960 F o r P e e r R e v i e w Page 7 of 22 E ' ( ! ) = E " + E D ! 2 # 2 1 + ! 2 # 2 ( Eqn . 7a ) tan ! ( " ) = E " ( " ) E ' ( " ) ( Eqn . 7b ) where E " ( ! ) = E D ! " 1 + ! 2 " 2 ( Eqn . 7c ) The frequency - based functions were computed using the average values of E ∞ , E D and τ for the microindentation and nanoindentation tests on similar ( thick ) samples as were used in the homogeneous compression tests . 3 . MODELING AND ANALYSIS An axisymmetric finite element ( FE ) model of the indentation experiment was developed using ABAQUS ( Version 6 . 7 , SIMULIA , Providence , RI , USA ) . The indenter was modeled as an analytical rigid surface and the contact between the indenter as the specimen surface was imposed to be frictionless ( Figure 2 ) . The specimen was assumed to be linear poroleastic and saturated and was discretized using eight - node elements with biquadratic displacement interpolation , bilinear pore pressure interpolation , and reduced integration ( the mesh consisted of 65830 nodes and 21735 elements ) . It was assumed that the specimen lies on an impervious stiff substrate and that water can diffuse freely across the entire layer surface , including the contact region . The mechanical behavior of a linear poroelastic material saturated with an incompressible fluid depends the elastic properties ( in the present case drained elastic modulus , E and Poisson’s ratio , ν were considered ) and on the hydraulic permeability κ [ 19 ] . The intrinsic permeability k = η W κ , where η W is the viscosity of water . ( For further background on poroelasticity the reader is referred to references [ 18 , 19 , 21 ] . ) To assess the values of these three material parameters from the results of indentation tests an identification algorithm was utilized . Given the output of the experiment in terms of indenter time - load data points ( t 1 , P 1 ) , … , ( t m , P m ) and the model of the experiment M ( x , t ) , whose response is governed by Page 7 of 22 Journal of Materials Research 1234567891011121314151617181920 21 222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960 F o r P e e r R e v i e w Page 8 of 22 a set of unknown parameters x , it is possible to compute the residuals for any choice of the parameter values : f i ( x ) = P i ! M ( x , t i ) P ave , i = 1 , … , m ( Eqn . 8 ) where P ave is the average experimental value . In the present case M ( x , t ) is the finite element model , and the unknown parameters x are E , ν and κ . For a least squares fit , the objective of the identification procedure is then finding the set of parameters x which minimizes F ( x ) = 1 2 ( f i ( x ) ) 2 i = 1 m ! ( Eqn . 9 ) Therefore the identification problem becomes the problem of the minimization of the objective function F ( x ) with respect to the unknown parameters x . In the present work the minimization problem was solved by using MATLAB ( The MathWorks , Natick , MA , US ) optimization toolbox and in particular the nonlinear least - squares routine , whose successful use in similar problems is reported in literature [ 23 - 25 ] . Identification was carried out for the hold segment of eight microindentation tests , five on thin gels and three on thick gels . No maximum value of F ( x ) was imposed as convergence criterion and the identification loop was iterated until the procedure showed no improvement in the minimization of F ( x ) . Typically convergence was achieved in 4 - 5 iterations . 4 . RESULTS Representative load - time ( P - t ) relaxation curves are shown in Figure 3 for ( a ) nanoindentation of a hydrated gel , ( b ) nanoindentation of dehydrated ( ethanol - soaked ) gel and ( c ) microindentation of hydrated gel . On this time - scale , the microindentation results are nearly elastic , while there is some relaxation present in the nanoindentation data on the same time - scale . Interestingly , the dehydrated sample ( Fig . 3b ) , although orders of magnitude stiffer than the hydrated sample tested under the same conditions ( Fig . 3a ) , exhibited more viscous dissipation than the hydrated samples . Numerical data derived from viscoelastic analysis of the full set of nanoindenation and microindentation tests are shown in Table 1 . As was evident in the Page 8 of 22 Journal of Materials Research 1234567891011121314151617181920 21 222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960 F o r P e e r R e v i e w Page 9 of 22 raw load - time responses ( Fig . 3 ) , dehydration increased the elastic modulus by three orders of magnitude regardless of dehydration method—air or immersion in ethanol . The elastic fraction ( f E ) decrease was greater in the ethanol - soaked gels compared with the air - dried gels . Overall the calculated storage modulus values from indentation were greater than those measured in two different modes of homogeneous compression tests , unconfined compression and DMA compression ( Figure 4a ) . Loss tangent values ( Fig . 4b ) were comparable for both compression tests , and similar to the peak calculated for nanoindentation . In the low frequency range for this experiment , the loss tangent from microindentation also started to approach the compressive values . It is clear that the standard linear solid model ( Fig . 1 ) is too simple a description of the dynamic behavior for these gel materials , given the sharp peak at a single frequency value . A representative fit to experimental microindentation data from the poroelastic FE model is shown in Figure 5 . Summary data from eight poroelastic FE fits to thick and thin gel microindentation tests are shown in Table 2 . The drained elastic modulus values are in agreement with the overall average equilibrium modulus , but are smaller than the individual values from the viscoelastic analysis of the same data ( data not shown ) ; this is likely because the finite layer thickness was accounted for in the FE model but not in the viscoelastic analysis . This is particularly an issue with the thin gels , for which the indentation depth h was more than 10 % of the layer thickness , l . There is also a trend towards decreasing modulus values with increasing indentation depth in the thin gel poroelastic results , although this effect is relatively small ( < 20 % ) . Poisson’s ratio increased with increasing indentation depth , and both hydraulic and intrinsic permeability values decreased with increased indentation depth . 5 . DISCUSSION Highly hydrated biological tissue and polymer gel materials are extremely compliant , and mechanical characterization of low - modulus materials holds several challenges . Indentation is an ideal mechanism for characterization of compliant materials , as there is no need to try to “grip” the sample as in a tensile test . However , new approaches are required for data analysis when it comes to hydrated time - dependent Page 9 of 22 Journal of Materials Research 1234567891011121314151617181920 21 222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960 F o r P e e r R e v i e w Page 10 of 22 materials—the elastic - plastic contact models [ 26 , 27 ] typically used for nanoindentation data analysis , are completely inappropriate in this context . Under displacement control , at a fixed displacement the load relaxes in a time - dependent material . There are relaxation mechanisms in both viscoelastic and poroelastic mechanical problems , but historically little effort has gone into distinguishing between the mechanisms . The choice is typically made a priori based on knowledge of the material , for example a viscoelastic solid polymer or a poroelastic hydrated soft tissue . Here the two approaches were compared explicitly . The length - scales probed here by nanoindentation and microindentation tests were significantly different . There was a two order of magnitude difference in the indentation depth and an order of magnitude difference in the indenter radius . As such , given the fact that the time - constant for poroelasticity , ! = L 2 / G " [ 18 , 21 ] contains an experimental length - scale ( L ) , it should be expected that the time constants observed in nanoindentation and microindentation were substantially different here . For larger experimental time - scales ( microindentation ) there was little relaxation ( i . e . a larger elastic fraction , f E ) in an experimental time - frame of tens of seconds when compared with more obvious time - dependence observed in the same time - frame in nanoindentation ( Fig . 3 ) . There is no length - scale intrinsic to viscoelasticity—as noted above , the appearance of different experimental time - constants for nanoindentation and microindentation is consistent with the existence of a length - scale associated with poroelasticity . It is also possible to identify differences between the shapes of the relaxation curves , given the fact that the mechanisms of relaxation are physically different . We further propose to use this curve shape as an additional piece of evidence to establish the active time - dependent mechanism is active in any given experiment . This curve - shape difference illustrated in Figure 6 , in which a best - fit from an FE spherical contact simulation on acrylamide gel is shown for both a poroelastic and a viscoelastic ( standard linear solid ) model ( Figure 6a ) . The difference between the fits is subtle , but plotting the residuals ( Figure 6b ) clearly demonstrates that the poroelastic fit is superior to the viscoelastic fit in this case : the viscoelastic fit both overshoots and undershoots at different points on the experimental curve . There are thus several independent pieces of evidence to suggest a poroelastic , instead of viscoelastic , mechanism operating in these Page 10 of 22 Journal of Materials Research 1234567891011121314151617181920 21 222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960 F o r P e e r R e v i e w Page 11 of 22 indentation tests . Given the emphasis on poroelastic flow , it is envisioned that time - domain , and not frequency - domain , measurements will be most suitable for nanoindentation characterization of hydrated gels and tissues . In the current study , experimental measurements of the elastic modulus of hydrated gel materials were consistent between microindentation and nanoindentation , although numerical values of the obtained elastic modulus were larger for indentation than for homogeneous compression testing . One potential experimental factor in overstimation of elastic modulus values is the indentation depth relative to the gel layer thickness . It has been shown with FE models that poroelastic layers show an apparent stiffening effect when the layer thickness is small [ 28 ] , an effect similar to that for an elastic multi - layered system . The thin gel results for microindentation ( Table 1 ) seem to be particularly afflicted with this , since comparison of the viscoelastic analysis—which assumes bulk half - space behavior—and the poroelastic analysis for a subset of the same gels ( Table 2 ) removes the overestimation relative to all other indentation data . The compressive values were numerically in good agreement with values of E = 0 . 22 MPa reported previously [ 29 ] for similar 20 % acrylamide gels . Therefore the indentation values appear to be still slightly too large , even in thick gels or when the finite layer thickness has been accounted for . A similar effect has been observed previously in non - gel polymeric systems , in which nanoindentation results consistently over - predict the elastic modulus compared with homogeneous loading [ 7 ] . It is unclear why this is the case but further investigations are clearly warranted . Gel intrinsic permeability values , obtained from inverse FE analysis of microindentation test data , ranged from 5 . 6 × 10 − 20 m 2 to 1 . 2 × 10 − 19 m 2 . These values are in direct agreement with a value of 1 × 10 − 19 m 2 previously published [ 30 ] for polyacrylamide gels of the same composition ( 20 % ) but using macroscopic homogeneous loading experiments . This result is encouraging , as it implies that indentation tests can be set up for high - throughput poroelastic characterization , especially when modern nanoindenters with automated x - y stage motion is available . However , each FE simulation for parameter optimization in the current study lasted for approximately 24 hours . Recently , a suggestion has been made [ 21 ] , based on previous analyses of the poroelastic spherical indentation problem [ 31 , 32 ] that a “master curve” approach could Page 11 of 22 Journal of Materials Research 1234567891011121314151617181920 21 222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960 F o r P e e r R e v i e w Page 12 of 22 be adopted for fast identification of permeability from experimental indentation data . The original suggestion and earlier analyses [ 21 , 31 , 32 ] were all based on step - load creep experiments , but there is no physical reason that a similar approach could not be adopted for displacement - controlled relaxation tests under more typical experimental conditions . The rapid identification of permeability from indentation tests would allow for “permeability mapping” of biological tissues or inhomogeneous materials , similar in concept to the “modulus map” approach already being used for elastic characterization of inhomogeneous materials and tissues [ 33 ] .
