IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT , VOL . 58 , NO . 4 , NOVEMBER 2011 643 Ensuring Quality Science From “R” to “D” : An Optimal Adoption Strategy for In - Licensing of Pharmaceutical Innovation Guozhen Zhao and Wen Chen Abstract —In today’s competitive business environment , phar - maceutical companies intensively explore contract R & D opportu - nities with small biotechnology companies and in - license externally discovered compounds to replenish their product pipelines . In or - der to maintain and increase external collaboration productivity , pharmaceutical companies must ﬁnd the most promising outside compounds generated in the research stage as the inputs for later in - house development stages . Thus , the “R” - to - “D” transition is signiﬁcant in ensuring the scientiﬁc quality of in - licensed com - pounds . In this paper , an optimal adoption strategy is proposed to evaluate the in - licensing opportunities for a pharmaceutical com - pany as it ﬁnances several biotech partners who focus on the same therapeutic area . This strategy is fundamentally an outsourcing decision process for the pharmaceutical company , and it is mod - eled as a Poisson process during which small biotechs submit their outcomes to the pharmaceutical company . We give the formula - tion for the process , whose simulation results , here , indicate that under the high uncertainty of both time value and market payoff , the pharmaceutical company should make its decision by trad - ing off research time for gradually emerging information on the compound’s quality . Speciﬁc characteristics that emerged in this process are discussed . We also carried out interviews with phar - maceutical R & D managers to explore the “practical applicability” of the model .

Digital Object Identiﬁer 10 . 1109 / TEM . 2011 . 2139215 more proprietary compounds from outside sources and putting these compounds through clinical trials , rather than resorting to in - house research . Consequently , pharmaceutical compa - nies’ in - licensing of objects developed elsewhere has experi - enced tremendous growth [ 39 ] . In 2002 , large pharmaceutical companies derived 40 % of the compounds in their develop - ment pipelines from in - licensed assets , compared to just 16 % in 1980 [ 6 ] . The proportion of revenue generated from exter - nally discovered products in the pharmaceutical industry has in - creased [ 46 ] , and according to Ceccagnoli and colleagues [ 11 ] , in almost 60 % of new branded drugs introduced from 1989 to 2004 , more than half of the patents protecting the new product originated outside the pharmaceutical companies themselves . In addition , large pharmaceutical companies have been shown to have higher success rates with in - licensed compounds than with compounds that they originated in - house [ 13 ] . In the case of in - licensing , the pharmaceutical company ( li - censee ) acquires the intellectual property ( IP ) of another party ( licensor ) , and expects this IP to ﬁll a gap in the licensee’s own development pipeline [ 39 ] . Pharmaceutical companies com - monly in - license developmental drugs from research - based and discovery - oriented biotechnology companies [ 41 ] , [ 49 ] . By the end of 2004 , one - third of the drugs marketed by major pharma - ceutical companies originated from licensing deals with smaller biotechnology companies [ 2 ] . “Large pharmas” and “small biotechs” different bodies of knowledge make each specialize in different phases of the drug innovation process [ 1 ] , [ 19 ] , which in turn makes in - licensing deals between them complementary and desirable . Small biotechnology companies , generally , have a comparative advantage in achieving early - stage discoveries in certain ﬁelds by using their cutting - edge technology in pharma - cogenomics , bioinformatics , proteomics , etc . [ 15 ] . By contrast , large pharmaceutical ﬁrms are considered more efﬁcient at later stage development [ 39 ] , conducting clinical testing [ 1 ] , market - ing and commercialization , and dealing with regulatory bodies like the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) [ 3 ] , [ 49 ] . Thus , in an ideal situation , pharmaceutical companies could in - license early - stage innovative compounds from biotechs to buttress their lagging R & D productivity and fuel their pipelines with attrac - tive projects [ 23 ] , [ 52 ] ; conversely , small biotechnology ﬁrms , by out - licensing their compounds to big pharmaceutical com - panies , could generate a stable source of much needed capital to keep their innovation engines running and maintain the research expertise necessary to turn their novel innovations into success - ful products [ 49 ] . Given such potentially reciprocal beneﬁts and synergy , pharmaceutical industry leaders have recognized 0018 - 9391 / $ 26 . 00 © 2011 IEEE 644 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT , VOL . 58 , NO . 4 , NOVEMBER 2011 in - licensing as a strategic mechanism through which they can achieve their corporate objectives [ 39 ] . However , the in - licensing strategy is not without its prob - lems , and there is a trend of R & D drug innovation organization being divided into separate “R” and “D” [ 45 ] . Some researchers ( e . g . , [ 21 ] , [ 25 ] , [ 48 ] ) have noticed an emerging drug innovation pattern in the pharmaceutical industry : given that the research component and the development component require consider - ably different strategies , organization patterns , and people skills , biotechs engage more in technology and chemistry ( i . e . , the ‘discovery’ part of drug innovation ) , and big pharmaceutical companies perform high - through screening and development for ﬁrst - in - human trials ( i . e . , the ‘development’ part of drug in - novation ) by using the compounds in - licensed from biotechs . As a result , one of the key concerns is that by further separat - ing “R” from “D” , in - licensing deals make the transition from “R” - to - “D” in the drug innovation process potentially more un - certain and problematic than in traditional in - house research and development . Industry data also show that pharmaceutical companies are shifting toward “D” by spending an increasing proportion of their R & D budget on development and portfo - lio management [ 25 ] . By 2004 , US pharmaceutical companies spent as much as 37 % of their total R & D budgets on clinical trial activities [ 19 ] . The uncertainties and problems in - licensing deals potentially incur during the “R” - to - “D” transition are at least twofold . First , in - licensed compounds may present a greater probabil - ity of failure than those developed in - house [ 22 ] , [ 34 ] , which makes the need for reducing the risk that an in - licensed lead compound may not succeed in late - stage clinical trials more pronounced [ 24 ] . Thus , a pharmaceutical company must deal with the question of how to guarantee the scientiﬁc quality of in - licensed compounds that are transferred from biotechs’ dis - covery stage to its own development and clinical trial stage . Second , considering the uncertainty involved in the market pay - off and time value of a drug innovation , it is not a good strategy for a pharmaceutical company that decides to in - license from outside to rely exclusively on one biotech in a certain therapeu - tic area , as serendipity is still the determinant success factor in drug discovery and development [ 39 ] . Rather , a pharmaceuti - cal company should collaborate with several small biotechs and maintain an in - licensing portfolio to diversify the risks . This is essentially a “hedge - betting strategy” for the pharma to put its innovation eggs in different baskets , which , from the per - spective of pipeline management , in turn makes the timing of the “R” - to - “D” transition of similar in - licensed lead compounds important . By successfully handling these two levels of possible uncertainties in in - licensing activities , companies may have bet - ter opportunities to pursue “quality science” over “pure luck , ” making drug innovation more a science - based rational process and less a chance - based trial - and - error “guesswork . ” As mentioned earlier , the success of an R & D process depends on the seamless transfer of the compounds in the “R” - to - “D” interface , in addition to smooth progress in both the research and the development stages individually . Thus , it is impera - tive to discuss how to reduce uncertainties and increase quality during the “R” - to - “D” transition of in - licensing in the pharma - ceutical industry . Accordingly , this paper addresses this issue by introducing an optimal adoption strategy speciﬁcally target - ing the “R” - to - “D” transfer of in - licensed lead compounds from biotechs to a pharmaceutical company , a strategy which could maximize the expected market payoff for the pharmaceutical company . More speciﬁcally , we present a simple model that creates a managerial tool that a pharmaceutical company ( li - censee ) could use to diversify its in - licensing risk by hedging its bets among various small biotechs while simultaneously op - timizing time - to - market and compound quality ; moreover , the biotechs ( licensors ) optimize their bargaining power according to the quality of the lead compounds that they out - license to the big pharmaceutical company . The remainder of this paper is organized as follows . In Section II , we ﬁrst give a brief description of in - licensing activi - ties during a drug discovery and development process . We focus our attention on the transition from preclinical testing ( i . e . , the end stage of drug discovery ) to Phase I clinical trials of the drug candidate ( i . e . , the ﬁrst time the compound is tested on human beings ) . In this section , we contend that , given the current trend of pharma – biotech in - licensing practices , it is imperative for big pharmaceutical company managers to have a managerial decision - making tool , speciﬁcally , designed for the “R” - to - “D” transition to help them make optimal decisions and diversify their risks . In Sections III and IV , we develop our formulation of the model , discuss its basic logic and main results , and ex - amine how it helps to realize the “hedge - betting strategy . ” In Section V , we ﬁrst develop a case study to test the potential usefulness of this model ; then , we discuss the possible practical application of this model in the “R” - to - “D” transition and how it could help pharmaceutical managers to optimize their deci - sion makings and reduce their decision burden . We interviewed pharmaceutical practitioners for the purpose of understanding the “real - world practice” of new drug discovery and validating the model we introduced . The interviews included several open questions about the new drug discovery process , in - licensing practices , and the interviewees’ comments on our model . Some comments of our interviewees are cited in Sections II , IV , and V . Finally , in Section VI , we discuss limitations , the possible application of the model to other industries , and future research directions . II . I N - L ICENSING IN THE “R” - TO - “D” T RANSITION : P ROS AND C ONS As the fortunes of big pharmaceutical companies and the biotech industry have become inextricably linked , interest in ef - fective drug licensing has been becoming increasingly prevalent over the last two decades ( e . g . , [ 3 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 39 ] ) . One senior vice president of a large pharmaceutical company we interviewed pointed out that : “Our goals are to have 50 % of our drugs com - ing from external alliances . The ﬁnancial and science trends are moving inexorably to this increasing and in - licensing will only increase in the future . ” However , given the inherent complexity of licensing events , pharmaceutical managers have to deal with the potential dilem - mas caused by both the pros and cons of biotech – pharma ZHAO AND CHEN : ENSURING QUALITY SCIENCE FROM “R” TO “D” : AN OPTIMAL ADOPTION STRATEGY 645 licensing and the need to have strategic considerations and use - ful managerial tools when facing the option to in - license a drug development project . One dilemma pharmaceutical company managers have to face is the timing of in - licensing deals . Currently , most in - licensing deals take place sometime between preclinical and Phase II clinical development [ 23 ] . Although pharmaceutical companies establish collaborations with biotechs and in - license molecu - lar compounds through almost all stages of drug innovation , from discovery , lead molecule , preclinical , until after Phase III clinical tests [ 3 ] , some researchers [ 14 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 23 ] argue that big pharmaceutical companies and small biotechnology ﬁrms could create more value for themselves by making deals ear - lier . In a simulation study , Kalamas and Pinkus [ 23 ] found that big pharmaceutical companies should in - license from biotechs more than 90 % of the time at the start of preclinical develop - ment . They also found optimal in - licensing deal distributions for both pharmaceutical companies and biotechs that favor ear - lier deals . It is argued that although late - stage licensing is im - portant to ﬁll short - term pharmaceutical pipeline gaps , for big pharmaceutical companies it is early - stage drug discovery col - laborations that play a fundamental role in ensuring that R & D operations remain competitive in the long run [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] . If this argument is valid , then the phases from compound optimization and preclinical testing to Phase I clinical testing—precisely the phases during which the compound goes from “R” to “D”—are appropriate periods for in - licensing deals to produce signiﬁcant beneﬁts for pharmaceutical companies . “R” - to - “D” stage licensing also beneﬁts the biotechs . Since 2002 , venture capital investors have shown a reduced appetite for companies with early - stage pipelines and have altered their investment behavior by moving toward companies with near - term products and revenues [ 7 ] . Thus , out - licensing early - stage molecular compounds to big pharmaceutical companies gives a biotech ﬁrm an alternative source of needed cash as early as pos - sible [ 52 ] . Furthermore , large - scale Phase III trials , regulatory affairs , and large - scale manufacturing and commercialization present huge challenges for an inexperienced biotech ﬁrm [ 52 ] . By focusing on early - stage research , out - licensing molecular compounds after optimization or preclinical testing on animal models , then , leaving late - stage development to a big pharma - ceutical company , a small biotech ﬁrm can make the most of its core competence and avoid its shortcomings . Therefore , early - stage licensing is favorable . Thus , licensing during the period of the “R” - to - “D” transition can beneﬁt both big pharmaceuti - cal companies and small biotechnology ﬁrms under the current pattern of drug research and development . In addition , some scholars ( e . g . , [ 1 ] ) have also argued that the “R” - to - “D” transition is socially optimal because of the cor - rect timing of licensing . Speciﬁcally , in a typical drug R & D innovation process , which has two main stages of research and development , some ﬁrms may be more efﬁcient in conducting early - stage research and others more efﬁcient in the ﬁnal - stage development , resulting in a synergic division of “knowledge la - bor” [ 29 ] . Thus , any timing other than that involved in transfer - ring from “R” to “D” might increase the total cost of innovation or even affect the well - being of society as a whole [ 1 ] . However , “R” - to - “D” stage in - licensing also imposes great risk and uncertainty on a pharmaceutical company , and conﬂicts of interest may exist between a big pharmaceutical company and small biotechnology ﬁrms . A pharmaceutical company typically compensates a biotech for in - licensing with a combination of an upfront payment , milestone payments , and royalties [ 52 ] . The upfront payment is usually made when the licensing agreement is executed and provides the biotech company with initial capital necessary to conduct research in the contracted area ; milestone payments are made when certain research goals are achieved or speciﬁed discovery events occur ; and royalty payments are usually made as a percentage of net sales once the drug is on the market , providing the biotech ﬁrm with appropriate incen - tives for due diligence [ 5 ] . Early - stage in - licensing is inherently riskier than late - stage development , less well characterized in terms of safety and efﬁcacy , further removed from the market - place in terms of time [ 22 ] , and more likely to fail ; therefore , a pharmaceutical company can be reluctant to pay too much up - front for early - stage in - licensing . The pharmaceutical company may prefer late - stage in - licensing deals because much of the un - certainty is already resolved by small biotech ﬁrms [ 41 ] . In ad - dition , early - stage in - licensing can be a disadvantage to a phar - maceutical company because many biotech ﬁrms retain their generic creations . In other words , these biotechs can invent and reinvent the wheel while the pharmaceutical company may have great difﬁculty obtaining high - quality discoveries over mediocre ones . Another problem for a big pharmaceutical company is that small biotechs may take advantage of asymmetric information to out - license their least promising compounds [ 36 ] . These are the possible reasons why some researchers and practitioners have identiﬁed a trend in recent years of big pharmaceutical companies increasing their in - licenses in middle - or late - stage programs [ 12 ] , [ 49 ] . Also , the bargaining power between a big pharmaceutical company ( licensee ) and a small biotech ﬁrm ( licensor ) deter - mines their respective preferences for the stage of licensing and , thus , the distribution of in - licensing payments . First , most small biotech ﬁrms are funded by venture capital and are un - der pressure to create a viable success strategy . The strategy of out - licensing molecular compounds is the key to surviving and continuing research . However , this fundamentally limits biotech ﬁrms’ negotiating power with a big pharmaceutical company . Second , biotechs always work on technological endeavors that are remote from the market and full of uncertainty and ambi - guity regarding sequence of considerations , choices , etc . This indicates that there is a long road to desirable outcomes and the expected returns are distant [ 4 ] . Moreover , without excellent negotiating skills , it is rather difﬁcult for biotech entrepreneurs to persuade a big pharmaceutical company to believe in the po - tential of their novel technologies . In addition , pharmaceutical companies are more cautious toward discovery collaborations with the biotech industry , which is somewhat fragmented from intense competition and lack of knowledge sharing , and phar - maceutical companies have begun regarding biotech offerings as increasingly generic in quality [ 10 ] . Thus , big pharmaceutical companies , who are more consolidated and established in terms of drug innovation , have more bargaining power . 646 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT , VOL . 58 , NO . 4 , NOVEMBER 2011 However , this situation has been changing in recent years and the negotiating power seems to begin shifting toward small biotechs [ 49 ] . People now tell more stories about pipelines dry - ing up and pharmaceutical companies competing for biotech deals . The competition is driven by a variety of factors : patent expirations of big pharmaceutical companies’ most proﬁtable products , an arguable decline in productivity for in - house dis - covery programs [ 25 ] , and some emerging biotechs’ increasing ability to withhold assets from potential partnerships [ 49 ] . More importantly , however , this shift of bargaining power imposes new challenges on pharmaceutical company managers . On the one hand , such competition for biotech lead compounds drives pharmaceutical companies to earlier stage deals ; on the other hand , they may also have to accept more clauses proposed by small biotechs , which emphasize milestone payments , royalties , and long - term proﬁt - sharing agreements for early - stage deals . This implies that the pharmaceutical company has to share more risks inherent in the early - stage research , risks initially borne by the biotechs . As small biotech companies begin to bolster their bargaining power against their big pharmaceutical counterparts , the latter are likely to increase in - licensing deals with biotechs , and these in - licensing agreements are likely to become more contractual and complicated in nature . Given the increasing complexity of in - licensing , pharmaceu - tical company managers have to face the aforementioned risks inherent in the “R” - to - “D” transition and incurred by bargaining power shifts . The key problem is that both licensing parties have no way of knowing in advance if the lead compound is going to succeed in later development stages and make to the market or not . They only have estimates and historical success rates to go by , and must do their best to use all available information to make their best guess [ 49 ] . This problem is , especially , salient for pharmaceutical managers because they are also on the disad - vantageous side of information asymmetry in in - licensing deals . Thus , in addition to grasping necessary valuation methods for an in - licensing deal , such as real option [ 55 ] , net present value ( NPV ) or expected NPV ( ENPV ) [ 7 ] , [ 33 ] , [ 53 ] , it is also im - perative for pharmaceutical managers to have tools to select the most - promising research - stage compound out of several generic candidates . Such managerial tools should be designed to help a pharmaceutical company increase its chances of developing superior quality drugs in the development stage , diversify risks in in - licensing deals , and extract as much value from the “R” - to - “D” transition as possible . In the next section , we present a model that a pharmaceutical company could use to select the best compound from available candidates aiming at the same therapeutic targets in later stage development . We show that , by using this model , a company’s chances of obtaining the optimal market payoff increases signiﬁcantly . III . M ODEL D EVELOPMENT To the best of our knowledge , Reinganum and Jensen are the initiators of modeling the demand for an innovation technology . The theoretical formulation of Reinganum’s [ 38 ] two - person game is based on the demand for a new technology . On the other hand , Jensen’s [ 20 ] decision model is more related to ours in the sense that in Jensen’s model , ﬁrms begin with initial as - sessments of the unknown proﬁtability of an exogenous techni - cal innovation and , without cost , gather information with which they update their assessments . McCardle [ 28 ] follows Jensen in using a Bayesian approach to model a single ﬁrm’s adoption decision , which allows the ﬁrm to continue gathering informa - tion and update its estimate of new technology’s proﬁtability . McCardle’s model also allows and predicts the occurrence of failed inventions by distinguishing between technological fea - sibility and economic proﬁtability . McCardle’s model focuses only on the decision process of one ﬁrm and one innovative technology . In drug R & D in - licensing practices , a pharmaceu - tical company not only evaluates a single project in - licensed from one biotechnology ﬁrm , but also it works with different biotechs , simultaneously , in order to decide whose project to se - lect . This phenomenon reﬂects the fact that in - licensing in drug R & D is no longer a linear process involving only one phar - maceutical company and one biotech ﬁrm ; rather , the process involves a network that ﬁgures more prominently in pharma - ceutical company’ success [ 21 ] . Within this network , pharma - ceutical companies compete for the best compounds they can in - license from biotechs , while biotechs compete among them - selves for pharmaceutical licensees for their therapeutically sim - ilar compounds . Accordingly , pharmaceutical companies need a framework for evaluating the relative performance of thera - peutically similar compounds from different biotechs . We focus on the establishment of such a framework . A . Model Assumptions and Limitations We constructed our model from the perspective of a large pharmaceutical company . The basic idea is that , in order to diversify the research and ﬁnancial risks , the pharma could es - tablish simultaneous early - stage research alliances with several small biotechs and select one compound from several candi - dates . Thus , in the context of our modeling for in - licensing , the pharmaceutical company is assumed to have n biotech ﬁrms that are actively seeking out - licensing for their lead compounds [ 41 ] . Speciﬁcally , the pharmaceutical company is considered to be the center of the licensing network [ 21 ] in the sense that 1 ) it ﬁnances all the biotechs’ lead compound research at the same time , and 2 ) the biotechs focus on molecular compounds for the same therapeutic targets , such as a certain receptor that leads to breast cancer or AIDS ; however , the research time the biotechs spend on their own compounds varies because of their indi - vidual research abilities . It makes sense to assume that several biotechs will focus on the same target because the depletion of “low - hanging fruits” results in the biotechs having only a small range of difﬁcult targets [ 26 ] , [ 42 ] , [ 47 ] . Thus , the several biotechs will compete to develop better compounds quickly . An interviewee estimated that “ . . . the typical big pharma company would have 10 + alliances like this . ” And another practitioner reported that “Answer ( to the number of such small biotechs ) is that it depends on the importance of a franchise to the company , the progress of internal programs , and the number of products that the disease can support . ” ZHAO AND CHEN : ENSURING QUALITY SCIENCE FROM “R” TO “D” : AN OPTIMAL ADOPTION STRATEGY 647 This implies that the negotiating power belongs largely to the pharmaceutical company , but it does not mean that the pharma - ceutical company in question is a monopsony in the licensing market . Rather , we ensure that the biotechs have counterbalanc - ing bargaining power for the following two assumptions . First , the pharmaceutical company has to pay an extra milestone pay - ment to the biotech who creates the currently best quality com - pound ; this assumption complies with both in - licensing payment practice and the current trend that small biotechs increasingly emphasize what happens upon success [ 49 ] . ( As we will dis - cuss later , by “currently best , ” we mean that the compound should not only satisfy all Phase I safety criteria , it , more im - portantly , should appear to be the most promising to reach the market among all already - available compounds . ) For instance , according to this assumption , the biotech who creates the ﬁrst compound will deﬁnitely receive the extra milestone payment . Also , if a second compound created by another biotech proves to be better than the ﬁrst compound , the biotech who creates the second compound will also get the extra milestone payment because this second compound is the “best” among the two already - available compounds ; but if the quality of the second compound is less than that of the ﬁrst , then the second biotech cannot receive the extra milestone payment because the ﬁrst compound is still the “best” among the already - available two compounds . This rule applies to all other later delivered com - pounds . Second , the biotech who submits a compound which is not the currently best reserves the right to take back its IP by pay - ing the pharmaceutical company a “penalty fee . ” ( Practically , such a biotech could lobby another pharmaceutical company to pay the “penalty fee” for the lesser quality compound to the focal pharmaceutical company , thus , giving the second pharmaceuti - cal company the IP . ) Third , as one senior director we interviewed pointed out : “We are aggressively looking for compounds to li - cense and the competition for the few good compounds ( and there are a lot of bad ones out there ) is intense , ” which indicates big pharmaceutical companies also compete among one another for small biotechs and , thus , give small biotech ﬁrms bargaining strength . We also assume that before deciding to develop an in - licensed compound , the focal pharmaceutical company incurs some cost to test the product’s safety ; such cost could be assumed to occur during Phase I clinical testing , when the candidate compound is tested in dozens of healthy adult bodies . There are various reasons for this assumption . First , the Phase I trial immediately follows the “R” stage and is the beginning of the “D” stage . Thus , it is necessary to take Phase I costs into consideration in order to understand the “R” - to - “D” transition . Second , we concede that passing the Phase I safety test does not naturally guarantee success in later development stages ; in fact , the pharmaceutical industry is full of cases in which the candidate compounds fail in Phase II and Phase III clinical trials or even after market launch . Rather , completion of Phase I simply reduces the risk of failure and gives drug scientists an opportunity to move forward . So , if the Phase I trial is successful , the pharmaceutical company can decide to develop the compound in further ( i . e . , Phase II and Phase III ) clinical trials on human subjects . And if it is fortunate enough to succeed in these phases , the next steps are regulatory application and commercialization . If , however , the compound fails to pass Phase I safety criteria , the pharmaceutical com - pany gives up further development of the compound , stops any further payments to the biotech who generated the abandoned compound , and waits for other biotechs’ compounds . In other words , if the pharmaceutical company gives up the ﬁrst com - pound ( no matter which of the n biotechs generated it ) , the company stops ﬁnancial support for the biotech , which pro - duced this compound , and there remain ( n − 1 ) biotechs who still receive research funding from it . Halting further funding to the failing biotech only means that the in - licensing on the focal project is stopped ; the pharmaceutical company and the biotech may continue to collaborate on other projects . Obviously , this type of competition among biotechs cre - ates an inherent dilemma for the pharmaceutical company : the compound generated earlier is not necessarily better and no one knows in advance the quality of the next - arriving com - pound [ 49 ] . This dilemma is , in fact , a reﬂection of the most fundamental characteristic of today’s drug innovation : serendip - ity and science interact to determine the fate of any molecular compound . Hence , the pharmaceutical company must decide whether to adopt a compound when it arrives or wait for the next , considering necessary tradeoffs between compound quality and time - to - market . On the one hand , the pharmaceutical company may hasten to adopt an early - produced but mediocre compound ; on the other , the company may waste too much time waiting for perfection and miss good opportunities which are increasingly hard to ﬁnd [ 16 ] . Moreover , as the bargaining power of small biotechs increases , they are unlikely to wait an unreasonably long time if they generate a good compound , and they may turn to the focal pharmaceutical company’s competitors ; thus , the focal big pharmaceutical company could lose both the best compound and a huge market share for it . Taking this dilemma into consideration , the following model provides the pharma - ceutical company the opportunity to in - license , since biotechs generate their compounds sequentially along the timeline , the best drug candidate in terms of expected market payoff , as early as possible . ( The expected market payoff of the best compound could be computed by the ENPV [ 33 ] or other valuation meth - ods ( e . g . , [ 7 ] , [ 55 ] ) , but we do not discuss the valuation of a compound ; instead we assume that the pharmaceutical com - pany already has a method to compute it . ) The model formulation makes use of the following parameters to describe the problem , and we will explain in detail how the model works . B . Formulation n : The number of biotech companies with which the pharmaceutical company signs contracts to research and in - license the compounds for the same therapeutic target . We ﬁrst assume that these n biotech compa - nies generate their compounds in a sequential pat - tern along the timeline . Second , we assume that each biotech company generates only one lead compound and submits it to the pharmaceutical company in ques - tion for in - licensing consideration . Thus , we also have n possible lead compounds . 648 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT , VOL . 58 , NO . 4 , NOVEMBER 2011 R k : The set of the remaining companies . k refers to the number of biotechs who have already submitted their compounds . For instance , if there are ﬁve biotechs , R 3 is the set in which there are still two remaining companies after three biotechs have already submitted their compounds . Thus , R 3 has two elements . λ i : The arrival rate of the lead compound for the biotech company i along the timeline . We assume that these compounds generated by different biotechs are inde - pendent and follow the Poisson process with parament λ i , [ 8 ] , [ 30 ] , [ 44 ] , [ 54 ] . K : The total upfront payments paid by the pharmaceu - tical company for all the n small biotechs at the time when the in - licensing agreements are reached between it and the n small biotechs . K is the initial payment of the big pharmaceutical company serving to activate the small biotechs’ research efforts . s i : The pharmaceutical company’s regular milestone payment per unit time to the biotech company i to sup - port early - stage drug research . Assume that s i = a λ i . In other words , the faster the biotech can generate its compound , the higher the unit - time milestone pay - ment . We make this assumption based on the facts that each biotech has its own particular characteris - tics , such as research strength , reputation , manage - ment skills , and applied technologies ; thus , the com - pounds generated by each biotech should have varying proﬁles , which in turn determine their chances of suc - cess for lead compound in - licensing . By s i = a λ i , we simplify these particular characteristics by assuming that the biotech that has stronger research capability will generate a compound faster , and , thus , should be granted more regular milestone payment . c : The ﬁxed cost spent on the Phase I clinical trial of a lead compound submitted by a biotech company for druggability test [ 51 ] . The pharmaceutical company determines which compound has the most potential to proceed to Phase II and Phase III tests and , ﬁnally , reach the market . m 1 : The expected market payoff if the compound the phar - maceutical company in - licenses ranks number 1 in druggability among all the n possible compounds . Thus , m 1 could be regarded as the expected payoff of a compound which has real breakthrough in a certain therapeutic area . m 2 : The expected market payoff if the compound the pharmaceutical company in - licenses ranks number 2 among all the n possible compounds in terms of drug - gability , and assuming that m 2 (cid:2) max i ( s i + K ) . Thus , m 2 could be regarded as the expected payoff of a compound with limited therapeutic value compared with a breakthrough compound . B : The extra milestone payment if the compound is the currently best one . Note that we distinguish two types of milestone payments for the sake of model build - ing . More speciﬁcally , in this model , we refer the aforementioned s i as the regular milestone payment the pharmaceutical company pays to the biotechs per unit time to support their continuous research efforts , whereas B is formulated as the extra milestone pay - ment rewarding the event that the biotech submits the currently best lead compound . α : The discount rate per unit time of the compounds due to the loss of value over time [ 44 ] . P : The “penalty fee” one small biotech has to pay to the pharmaceutical company if the biotech wants to get back its IP . g k : The added interim cost the pharmaceutical company incurs if it decides not to in - license the k th emerging candidate and wait for the next outcome . In other words , g k refers to the cost incurred during the period between the emergence of the k th compound , which is rejected by the pharmaceutical company , and the emergence of the ( k + 1 ) th compound on which the pharmaceutical company is about to make a decision . Our analysis begins from the cost g k , and g k has two parts : one is the regular milestone payments and the other is the cost of the Phase I clinical trial on an arrived compound . The total regular milestone payment from the next arrival of remaining company set R k is equal to (cid:2) i ∈ R s i / (cid:2) i ∈ R λ i , where (cid:2) i ∈ R s i is the unit - time regular milestone payments for supporting the remaining biotech companies in the set R k , which have not yet generated a compound . Additionally , we have assumed that the outcomes of the remaining biotechs in the set R k are independent and follow the exponential distribution with the parameter λ i , i ∈ R k ; therefore , the expected wait time for the next arrival of a compound is 1 / (cid:2) i ∈ R λ i : g k = (cid:2) i ∈ R s i (cid:2) i ∈ R λ i + c = a + c = g . ( 1 ) When a new compound comes out , the biotech who generated it submits it to the pharmaceutical company for the Phase I trial to determine the compound’s safety and its potential to go successfully through subsequent clinical trials and reach the market . Once the compound is shown to be safe , then the phar - maceutical company decides whether to develop it in further clinical tests . If the pharmaceutical company decides to develop the compound , then it ceases all regular milestone payments s i to the remaining biotechs . These biotechs can then turn to other pharmaceutical companies who may be the potential buyers for their products to seek ﬁnancial support for their continuous re - search . If the focal pharmaceutical company , after the Phase I trial , ﬁnds that the current compound does not meet expecta - tions and decides not to develop it further , then the biotech who generated the compound reserves the right to take the compound ( i . e . , its IP ) back by paying the focal pharmaceutical company P and out - licensing it to other pharmaceutical companies who are interested in the compound . In the current health care market ecology , the ﬁrst real break - through compound in the market captures a 40 – 60 % share , and the second only around 15 % [ 15 ] . This phenomenon reﬂects the importance of time - to - market ; however , currently almost 50 % of blockbusters are next - in - class compounds that do not provide highly differentiated therapeutic value [ 17 ] . Thus , the ZHAO AND CHEN : ENSURING QUALITY SCIENCE FROM “R” TO “D” : AN OPTIMAL ADOPTION STRATEGY 649 aforementioned dilemma that the big pharmaceutical company faces becomes more salient : that is , whether to occupy market share earlier with a compound whose quality might or might not be best , or wait longer for a better compound that might or might never come , due to the uncertain future . What makes the situation more complex is that even though the later arriving compound might be better than an earlier one , it may still have difﬁculty capturing the market share . Hence , it seems reasonable to assume that 1 ) if the pharmaceutical company is lucky enough to get the best candidate in terms of druggability among the n biotechs , such compound is more likely to become a real break - through and it will get a relatively higher m 1 expected market payoff ; 2 ) but if the pharma gets the second - best compound that is less likely to provide signiﬁcantly higher therapeutic value , it will gain m 2 expected market payoff that could be assumed smaller than m 1 ; and 3 ) the situation in which m 2 is close to m 1 should be considered because if the second - best compound is the ﬁrst - in - class one , it may have some ﬁrst - mover advantage , and , thus , its payoff m 2 should not be too much lower than m 1 . In the numerical study later ( Section V ) , we will discuss the case in which m 2 is close to m 1 in detail . Otherwise , the company will get 0 . It is not enough to only consider the expected market pay - off of an in - licensed compound ; one other inherent drug R & D challenge pharmaceutical managers must take into account is the value - deteriorating impact of time . In other words , waiting for a compound will actually decrease its value potential . Lead compounds intended for different therapeutical targets may be subject to different deteriorating rates of time . For instance , deterioration rates for diseases such as H1N1 are great either because of rapid mutation or because they occur only during spe - ciﬁc seasons of the year . Conversely , diseases such as cancers may have a lower time - related value - deteriorating rate . More - over , if we consider the fact that in today’s highly competitive market , the focal pharmaceutical company is not necessarily the only company operating within a therapeutic area , time can also be very value deteriorating even in serious and life - threatening diseases that are not seasonal . As formulated earlier , the unit - time impact of time value on the compounds is represented by α . We use J k ( 1 ) to denote the optimal expected market pay - off from the emergence of the k th compound until the end of all research ( i . e . , when the slowest biotech generates the n th compound ) , under the condition that the k th outcome surfaces as the currently best in the Phase I trial . As already noted , by “currently best , ” we mean that the compound should not only satisfy all Phase I trial safety criteria , but , more importantly , should appear to be the most promising compound to reach the market . Remember that the pharmaceutical company no longer pays the regular milestone payments s i to the ( k − 1 ) biotechs who have already generated the previous ( k − 1 ) compounds at k th stage . Denote J k ( 0 ) as the expected optimal market payoff from the emergence of the k th compound to the end of all research , under the condition that the k th outcome is not the currently best . In order to maximize the expected market payoff , the strategy of the pharmaceutical company is as follows . First , if it ﬁnds that a particular biotech’s submitted compound is the currently best , then it will keep the compound’s IP , reward the biotech with the extra milestone payment B , and decide whether to develop the compound or wait for a superior product . Second , if it ﬁnds that the compound submitted by the biotech is not the currently best , then it can decide to give up the compound and allow the biotech to purchase the IP back . The question then becomes : What is the optimal time in terms of expected market payoff for the pharmaceutical company to stop waiting for a potentially better compound and begin developing the currently best compound ? Denote γ k = (cid:2) i ∈ R k λ i α + (cid:2) i ∈ R k λ i . Here , γ k is a number that could be interpreted as a discount to the expected market payoff of the ( k + 1 ) th compound from its arrival time to the k th compound’s arrival time , given the unit - time discount rate of α . We use backward dynamic programming [ 43 ] to approach to the question : J n ( φ , r ) = m 1 + P 1 r = 0 − B 1 r = 1 . Hence , according to the deﬁnitions of J k ( 0 ) and J k ( 1 ) , for all k = n − 1 , n − 2 , . . . , 1 , we have J k ( R k , r ) = max (cid:3) k nm 1 + ( n − k ) k n ( n − 1 ) m 2 + P 1 r = 0 − B 1 r = 1 , − g + γ k E R k + 1 , r (cid:4) ( J k + 1 ( R k + 1 , r (cid:4) ) ) + P 1 r = 0 − B 1 r = 1 (cid:4) . When k = 0 , J 0 ( R 0 , 0 ) = max { 0 , − K − g + γ 0 E R 1 , 1 ( J 1 ( R 1 , 1 ) ) } . Thus , we have the following lemma . Lemma 1 : γ 0 > γ 1 > γ 2 > · · · > γ n . Lemma 1 could be easily proved as follows . Proof : By R k ⊃ R k + 1 for all k , we have (cid:2) i ∈ R k λ i > (cid:2) i ∈ R k λ i . Therefore , γ k > γ k + 1 for all k . (cid:2) Lemma 1 indicates that the fewer the number of the remaining biotechs who have still not generated a compound , the longer the pharmaceutical company will wait for the arrival of the next compound , if it wishes to wait . Lemma 2 : If ∃ k ∗ , R k ∗ : k ∗ n m 1 > (cid:5) k ∗ + 1 n m 1 + k ∗ k ∗ + 1 P (cid:6) γ k ∗ and k ∗ ( n − k ∗ ) n ( n − 1 ) m 2 > [ n − ( k ∗ + 1 ) ] ( k ∗ + 1 ) n ( n + 1 ) m 2 γ k ∗ , then k nm 1 > (cid:5) k + 1 n + k k + 1 P (cid:6) γ k and k ( n − k ) n ( n − 1 ) m 2 > [ n − ( k + 1 ) ] ( k + 1 ) n ( n + 1 ) m 2 γ k , for all k > k ∗ . 650 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT , VOL . 58 , NO . 4 , NOVEMBER 2011 ( Please see the Appendix for the proofs of Lemma 2 and Theorem 1 . ) Lemma 2 proves that as the k increases ( i . e . , as the number of the biotechs who submit their compounds increases ) , the probability of the pharmaceutical company obtaining a better - than - currently - best compound in the future decreases . However , as the time goes on , the value - deteriorating impact becomes increasingly unbearable for the pharmaceutical company . Thus , the company must make a choice between waiting for a better compound and enduring the time - based loss of value . Theorem 1 gives the adoption decision the pharmaceutical company should follow . Theorem 1 : If current k , R k satisﬁes that k nm 1 > (cid:5) k + 1 n m 1 + k k + 1 P (cid:6) γ k and k ( n − k ) n ( n − 1 ) m 2 > [ n − ( k + 1 ) ] ( k + 1 ) n ( n + 1 ) m 2 γ k then J k (cid:4) ( R k (cid:4) , r ) = k (cid:4) n m 1 + ( n − k (cid:4) ) k (cid:4) n ( n − 1 ) m 2 + P 1 r = 0 − B 1 r = 1 ∀ k (cid:4) > k . Theorem 1 discloses that once the pharmaceutical company ﬁnds that the gain achieved by waiting for a better compound cannot offset the loss incurred by the time discount , it will decide to stop waiting and begin to develop the currently best compound at hand . So , the essential idea of this model is to ﬁnd the exact break - even point at which additional losses offset the marginal gains , and at this point the pharmaceutical company should stop wasting time and begin to develop the currently best compound in hand . In addition , the extend of the time discount depends on both the unit - time discount rate α and the time length between the arrival of the k th and the ( k + 1 ) th compound . Based on Lemma 2 and Theorem 1 , we have the following . Corollary 1 : If current k satisﬁes that m 1 > (cid:5)(cid:5) 1 + 1 k (cid:6) m 1 + n k + 1 P (cid:6) γ k and 1 > (cid:5) 1 − 1 n − k (cid:6) (cid:5) 1 + 1 k (cid:6) γ k then the pharmaceutical company should prefer to choose the currently best compound instead of waiting for the next one . IV . M ETHODOLOGY In this section , we show how the backward induction applied in the DP for n = 3 , and we search optimal decisions for ev - ery set of remaining biotechs .

Notice that the complexity of the DP increases exponentially as the number of biotechs n increases . The major beneﬁt of the DP is that it provides the optimal decision for the pharmaceutical company in each stage at which the set of remaining biotechs R k contains different biotechs . We will discuss the effectiveness of this methodology later with numerical cases . V . N UMERICAL STUDY FOR A VIRTUAL PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY A . Numerical study Large pharmaceutical companies work with small biotechs intensively in preclinical drug discovery . Key pharmaceutical companies actively collaborate with biotechs in therapeutic ar - eas such as oncology , infectious diseases , AIDS , etc . , and the most active dealmakers include companies like GSK , Pﬁzer , Merck , and Novartis [ 21 ] . Novartis , for instance , spends 30 % of its R & D budget on external collaborations with 120 biotech companies and 280 academic centers [ 31 ] . One pharmaceutical company can collaborate with several biotechs , simultaneously , on a speciﬁc therapeutic area . Thus , we believe that by using publicly available real - world data , we can estimate the robust - ness of our model’s performance by simulating the in - licensing practices of a virtual pharmaceutical company . In this case study , the model requires the following data ( see Section III - B for detailed explanations of each parameter ) . 1 ) m 1 : The expected sales of a new drug during its total patent protection time if the new drug ranks number 1 among the n biotechs . 2 ) m 2 : The expected sales of a new drug during its total patent protection time if it ranks number 2 among the n biotechs . 3 ) n : The number of biotechs from whom a pharmaceutical company in - licenses compounds for a certain therapeutic target . 4 ) s i : The regular milestone payment paid for biotech i per year . 5 ) λ i : The arrival rate of compound for each individual biotech i . 6 ) c : Costs for the Phase I trial . 652 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT , VOL . 58 , NO . 4 , NOVEMBER 2011 Within the aforementioned parameters , Phase I trial costs could be considered ﬁxed under prevalent scientiﬁc and tech - nological conditions in the pharmaceutical industry . The com - pound arrival rate λ i depends on the particular characteristics of individual biotech i , such as its research technologies or man - agerial skills , and the more effective the managerial skills to coordinate research efforts the quicker the creation of a new compound . The regular milestone payment s i is determined by the current business environment in both the pharmaceuti - cal and biotech industries , and the particular technological and managerial characteristics of individual biotech i . Therefore , the key parameters that could inﬂuence the performance of our model are the total expected sales m 1 and m 2 , and discount factor α . Academic papers and news reports indicate that an - nual sales of a blockbuster drug generally exceeds US $ 1 billion ( e . g . , [ 15 ] , [ 39 ] ) . For instance , according to Reuters’ report [ 40 ] , in 2002 , the 10th bestselling blockbuster ( Zoloft by Pﬁzer ) had total sales of more than US $ 2 . 7 billion . Thus , if the new com - pound is a real breakthrough ( i . e . , in the context of this study , this compound ranks number 1 among all n possible compounds ) , we estimate that its annual “peak sales” would be US $ 1 billion . Furthermore , we take Reepmeyer’s view [ 39 ] that the effective patent protection time for a drug is estimated to be as short as 8 years . Thus , a reasonable estimation of the total market sales of new drug m 1 could be set at US $ 8 billion . But most drugs never become blockbusters , and “if your product is not a blockbuster , you may ﬁnd that the development expenses . . . chew up a lot of beneﬁt” [ 49 , p . 1226 ] ; thus , m 2 is estimated in this paper as lower than m 1 . We noticed that pharmaceutical companies do not collaborate with only a few biotech ﬁrms ; rather , the num - ber can be in the hundreds . For instance , we studied the top 10 big pharmaceutical companies , ranked by the number of drug R & D alliances , from 2000 to 2003 . The average number of col - laborations in early - stage research for one big pharmaceutical company was 43 . 6 small biotechs ( data from [ 37 ] ) . Moreover , in order to identify the ranges of the collaborations a typical phar - maceutical company has with biotechs in a therapeutic area , we studied the R & D external network of Novartis carefully , and , based on our best observations and reasoning , we estimated that the range of biotechs with whom a typical pharmaceutical com - pany collaborates for in - licensing in a certain therapeutic area could be around 3 to 8 . In other words , n ranges from 3 to 8 . We should also note that n cannot increase inﬁnitely because a pharmaceutical company does not have unlimited R & D funding to support an unlimited number of biotechs . We borrowed the data for average Phase I trial costs from Guedj and Scharfstein’s estimation [ 18 ] that this amount is around US $ 15 million . Moreover , according to Jones [ 22 ] , the upfront payment ( which may include some R & D funding and equity investment ) for each in - licensing deal was US $ 14 million in 2006 . Since in this numerical study , the number of biotechs n is assumed to be 5 , and considering the payment inﬂation after 2006 , we estimated the total upfront payment to the ﬁve biotechs to be K = US $ 100 . It is also estimated that the recent year preclinical asset payment was around $ 123 – 124 million [ 22 ] and the time for the payment was around 4 to 5 years [ 10 ] . Thus , we assume that the annual average regular TABLE I TABLE II milestone payment of s i , ∀ i , is around $ 25 million . Generally , the time spent on drug discovery before Phase I ( which includes basic research , target identiﬁcation and validation , lead ﬁnding , lead optimization , and in vitro and animal model testing ) is about 7 years [ 22 ] , [ 35 ] , [ 39 ] . However , if we consider the fact that many biotechs already have something viable in hand before they seek out - licensing with a big pharmaceutical company , the time used in basic research and target identiﬁcation could be omitted . Thus , a reasonable estimation of the interval time be - tween the arrival of two consecutive compounds is around 2 – 4 years . Thus , the arrival rate λ i ranges from 0 . 20 to 0 . 40 . Thus , in Example 1 , we estimate the parameters as follows . Example 1 : n = 5 , λ 1 = 0 . 40 , λ 2 = 0 . 35 , λ 3 = 0 . 30 , λ 4 = 0 . 25 , λ 5 = 0 . 20 , a = s i λ i = 60 , c = 15 , g = 15 + 60 = 75 , K = 100 , m 1 = 8000 , m 2 = 4000 , P = 1000 , B = 100 ( unit : million dollars ) . The purpose of Example 1 is to test how the model works when the value - deteriorating impact of time changes according to the characteristics of the compounds for different therapeutic targets . For instance , if the compound aims at a therapeutic area , where the inherent time - discount rate is high or the competition is hard , α could be considered larger ; otherwise , the discount factor α could be considered relatively small . Observation 1 : As unit - time discount rate α increases , the pharmaceutical company prefers to stop waiting . Explanation : As α increases , γ k will decrease , which implies the present value of the ( k + 1 ) th compound if discounted to the arrival time of k th becomes relatively small . Hence , the economic loss of waiting for the next arrival of a compound ZHAO AND CHEN : ENSURING QUALITY SCIENCE FROM “R” TO “D” : AN OPTIMAL ADOPTION STRATEGY 653 Fig . 1 . α = 0 . 11 . increases . Therefore , the pharmaceutical company should use the currently best compound at hand , rather than wait for a potentially better compound . (cid:2) Observation 2 : As γ k decreases , the pharmaceutical company prefers to stop waiting . Explanation : Consider the case α = 0 . 22 , when the set is R 3 = { 1 , 2 } , that is when the pharmaceutical company has already had three compounds available , the remaining two biotechs are biotch 1 and biotech 2 , and the pharmaceutical com - pany still prefers to wait because biotech 1 and biotech 2 have relatively higher innovation rates of λ 1 = 0 . 40 and λ 2 = 0 . 35 , respectively ; that is , they are believed to have better manage - rial skills in using their advanced technology . However , when R 2 = { 1 , 3 } , the company prefers to stop , because biotech 3 has a relatively lower rate of λ 3 = 0 . 30 that indicates a lower managerial skill or lower technology level . In other words , if the expected wait time before the next compound’s arrival is rela - tively long , then the pharmaceutical company will stop ; if the expected wait time for the next arrival is relatively short , then it will wait . Notice that the decision about whether or not to wait is not only determined by the amount of available compound candidates but also by the properties of the remaining biotechs in terms of their managerial skills and research capabilities ( i . e . , their individual arrival rate λ i ) . So intuitively , the focal phar - maceutical company prefers to wait for those biotechs whose research capability and managerial skills are higher . (cid:2) Figs . 1 – 7 illustrate how the pharmaceutical company makes its optimal adoption decision according to different levels of unit - time discount rates α , which in turn are determined by the characteristics of the compounds’ cure targets or the com - petition . As α increases , the time value of the lead com - pounds becomes increasingly important ; in other words , the company hopes to push the new drug to market as early as possible . Fig . 1 shows that when the unit - time discount rate α is small , the pharmaceutical company prefers to wait longer for all ﬁve biotechs’ compounds , regardless of the innovation rate λ i . How - ever , as α slightly increases to 0 . 16 , as shown in Fig . 2 , the innovation rate λ i ( i . e . , the biotechs’ research capability and managerial skills ) becomes signiﬁcant . More speciﬁcally , if the innovation process reaches stage R 3 as in Fig . 2 , the pharmaceu - tical company will note which biotechs have not yet submitted their compounds . If these remaining biotechs are biotech 3 and 5 , ( with λ 3 = 0 . 30 and λ 5 = 0 . 20 , respectively ) , or biotech 4 and 5 ( with λ 4 = 0 . 25 and λ 5 = 0 . 20 , respectively ) , the phar - maceutical company will stop waiting for them because their innovation rate is slow , and it would have to wait an unreason - ably long time . However , if the remaining biotechs at stage R 3 are other combinations , it is still beneﬁcial for the pharmaceu - tical company to wait for the next compound . Fig . 3 indicates that when α increases to 0 . 22 , the pharma - ceutical company prefers to stop waiting at stage R 3 for most combination of biotechs except the set including biotech 1 and biotech 2 . Figs . 4 – 6 could be interpreted similarly to Figs . 2 and 3 . In the extreme case of Fig . 7 , in which the unit - time discount rate is as high as 0 . 51 , the pharmaceutical company will stop as early as at R 2 ; that is , it will decide to move on to the later stage when there are only two compounds out of ﬁve available . Example 2 tests how the model works if the compound the pharmaceutical company in - licenses and develops is the second best one among all the in - licensed biotechs . The discussion of m 2 is important because it inﬂuences the extent to which the pharmaceutical company tries to become the ﬁrst mover in the market . More speciﬁcally , if the company ﬁnds that becoming the ﬁrst to market is more important than waiting for the best available compound , then it may expedite the development of the compound at hand and take it to market as early as possible . Because such a compound may not be a perfect breakthrough 654 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT , VOL . 58 , NO . 4 , NOVEMBER 2011 Fig . 2 . α = 0 . 16 . Fig . 3 . α = 0 . 22 . and , thus , end up being the second best globally among the n biotechs , its expected market payoff would not be as high as that of a real breakthrough . Thus , we assume that the expected payoff m 2 from such a compound would be less than m 1 . We examine how the changes in expected m 2 inﬂuence the pharmaceutical company’s adoption decision . Speciﬁcally , by recognizing the fact that the ﬁrst - in - class compound may take a large market share and the second - in - class compound may still have difﬁculty in capturing the market even though it might have better quality , we also consider the situation in which m 2 is close to m 1 . Example 2 : λ 1 = 0 . 40 , λ 2 = 0 . 35 , λ 3 = 0 . 30 , λ 4 = 0 . 25 , λ 5 = 0 . 20 , a = s i λ i = 60 , c = 15 , g = 15 + 60 = 75 , K = 100 , m 1 = 8000 , α = − ln ( 0 . 80 ) ≈ 0 . 22 , P = 1000 , B = 100 ( unit : million dollars ) . Observation : 3 When m 2 approaches to m 1 , the pharmaceu - tical company prefers to stop waiting . Explanation : As m 2 approaches to m 1 , the pharmaceutical company’s incentive to obtain the best - quality compound de - creases because ﬁrst - mover advantage becomes more and more important compared with relative druggability . (cid:2) Figs . 8 – 12 illustrate how the pharmaceutical company makes its adoption decision according to its expectation of the second - ranked compound’s market payoff . In fact , m 1 here could be regarded as an idealized “benchmark” against which the ZHAO AND CHEN : ENSURING QUALITY SCIENCE FROM “R” TO “D” : AN OPTIMAL ADOPTION STRATEGY 655 Fig . 4 . α = 0 . 29 . Fig . 5 . α = 0 . 36 . pharmaceutical company compares the expected payoff of the compounds in hands . As the ﬁgures show , when the company ex - pects the market payoff m 2 to be only 1000 million dollars ( see Fig . 8 ) , it will wait until nearly all the remaining biotechs sub - mit their compounds . As expected m 2 increases , the company makes its adoption decision according to the remaining biotechs . If the remaining biotechs have a higher innovation rate λ i , the company will wait ; if the remaining biotechs have a lower inno - vation rate λ i , the company will stop waiting . However , when the pharmaceutical company expects the market payoff m 2 to be about 5000 – 6000 million ( see Fig . 12 ) ( i . e . , the gap between m 2 and m 1 becomes closer ) , it will stop waiting as soon as three biotechs , no matter what their innovation rate λ i , submit their compounds . Thus , in this condition , the optimal stopping time tends to remain stable at the early stage . But more importantly , Example 2 shows that , as the expected payoff m 2 increases and approaches m 1 , the difference of the expected market pay - offs between the best - quality compound and the second - best - quality compound becomes less signiﬁcant ; rather , it becomes more and more beneﬁcial for the focal big company to gener - ate a ﬁrst - in - class compound that is not necessarily the “best in class” . Hence , it prefers to stop waiting earlier and put the compound that is already in hand into the later development stages . 656 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT , VOL . 58 , NO . 4 , NOVEMBER 2011 Fig . 6 . α = 0 . 43 . Fig . 7 . α = 0 . 51 . B . Possible Application and Practicality Practically , this model provides managers of big pharmaceu - tical companies with a useful managerial tool that may greatly turn their intuitive estimates into “scientiﬁc” decision processes , enhance their decision making accuracy , and enable them to make optimal choices . First , this model does not contradict people’s intuition and ex - perience ; rather , it provides big pharmaceutical company man - agers with a managerial method that could help them make more science - based decisions . For instance , common sense dictates that if a pharmaceutical company intends to in - license a com - pound with a large time - discount factor , the company should not wait too long to make the in - licensing decision . However , phar - maceutical company managers do not necessarily know how fast they should make such a decision . By using this model , managers can rely on a more accurate decision - making process rather than their intuition ; as long as managers have criteria about the compound’s expected market payoffs ( which could be derived from experience data’s ENPV ) and an expected time - discount rate of the compound’s therapeutic area ( which could be derived from drug scientists’ experience ) , they could have a much better idea of the exact time they should make their in - licensing decision . The model is sensitive to the information ZHAO AND CHEN : ENSURING QUALITY SCIENCE FROM “R” TO “D” : AN OPTIMAL ADOPTION STRATEGY 657 Fig . 8 . m 2 = 1000 . Fig . 9 . m 2 = 2000 . unfolding from several small biotechs’ candidate compounds and helps managers make optimal decisions regarding the tim - ing and pacing of in - licensing deals . The model makes sure that the time at which pharmaceutical company managers decide to stop waiting for better compounds is the optimal time because it is the break - even point , and any other stopping time can only reduce expected market payoff as a whole . Second , this model could diversify the risks inherent in the drug compound R & D process because it allows a big pharma - ceutical company to put its eggs in different baskets and hedges its bets among various small biotechs . Although this approach is not new and pharmaceutical industry use risk - diversifying logic extensively in practices such as R & D portfolio manage - ment [ 50 ] , the model extends this logic by suggesting a de - tailed algorithm that can be implemented during the transition from “R” - to - “D” . Since the quality of the compound in - licensed during the “R” - to - “D” transition directly determines the com - pound’s probability of surviving through the later development stages , diversifying the risk at the point of “R” - to - “D” by in - licensing from several small biotechs , as opposed to just one , decreases the uncertainty that big pharmaceutical companies face in later development stages . In this sense , the model pro - vides an optimal solution to the “hedge - betting strategy” or “diversifying strategy , ” and pharmaceutical company managers 658 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT , VOL . 58 , NO . 4 , NOVEMBER 2011 Fig . 10 . m 2 = 3000 . Fig . 11 . m 2 = 4000 . have an opportunity to compare compound quality among dif - ferent biotechs . Hence , they can get an “as - good - as - possible” compound within an “as - short - as - possible” time . In the eyes of practitioners , this model has both pros and cons . One interviewee pointed out that one merit of this model is that “there is a payoff on both sides , in that the small orga - nization may not have the capitalization or the knowledge of the clinical development process , so they also strongly leverage on a development partner who knows how to quickly turn the crank on clinical studies , since this pulls milestone and royalty awards forward in time . ” But this interviewee also expressed his concern that “ . . . I’d worry a bit about the sequencing issue . All these would presumably be in about the same development time envelope , meaning that they will be some delay ( perhaps signiﬁcant ) in being accretive to earnings . ” Another interviewee seemed to be more optimistic by indicating that “The bottom line is that both pharma and biotech need to get more efﬁcient in developing active compounds , and if you believe biotech is better than pharma at drug discovery and early validation , then this model is the future of the industry” . After all , in pharmaceutical in - licensing practices , “the big question is can you build a pipeline externally if you have to spend about $ 1 billion for every compound with good Phase II data , but it is just as expensive ( or more so ) to do this internally if ZHAO AND CHEN : ENSURING QUALITY SCIENCE FROM “R” TO “D” : AN OPTIMAL ADOPTION STRATEGY 659 Fig . 12 . m 2 = 5000 or m 2 = 6000 . you account for the attrition rate , ” and “the key is to be selective , . . . , evaluate much but enter into agreements selectively , ” as our interviewees correctly pointed out . VI . C ONCLUSION , L IMITATIONS , AND F UTURE R ESEARCH I MPLICATIONS The goal of this paper is to model serial in - licensing deals for adopting discovery - stage or preclinical - stage biotechnol - ogy lead compounds with an optimizing strategy that trades off between time value and lead compound quality . An opti - mal adoption model is developed to explore the timing for the pharmaceutical company to in - license and adopt drug innova - tions according to the expected market payoff determined by the ranking of the compound quality , the number of biotechs , and the value - deteriorating impact of time . The results suggest that pharmaceutical companies should consider the pros and cons of higher compound quality , a longer waiting time , and compound time value . The model also indicates that a pharma - ceutical company should aggressively seek external R & D in - licensing opportunities with several biotechs , simultaneously , for the purpose of “hedging the risk . ” These biotechs would , of course , be researching compounds targeting the same speciﬁc therapeutic area . Therefore , it is not impossible for a pharmaceu - tical company to in - license the right compound at the right time , whereas the small biotechs can also realize their own interests . This model could be widely used in other areas . For instance , the analysis of in - licensing deals can be extended from exter - nal collaborations to a pharmaceutical company’s in - house drug discovery process . R & D project managers can use the model to stimulate competition among different research groups working on the same project within a company . Moreover , there has been recent discussion in the industry about the merit of “open - source drug development” ( e . g . , [ 27 ] ) ; if open - source drug develop - ment can really help the pharmaceutical industry access to more new drugs and diagnostics , then this model could help both pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology ﬁrms identify the appropriate compounds in an incremental way . Furthermore , its usefulness could be extended to R & D transfers beyond the pharmaceutical industry . Since the model is designed for the transition period between stages , it can apply to many projects that need to guarantee the quality of knowledge - generated up - stream during transfer downstream and can be modiﬁed accord - ingly with minimal effort . For example , a software company could use the model to in - license open - source software pro - grams from several independent research groups or freelancers and adopt the currently best one after comparison . Although the in - licensing strategy that we propose in this pa - per is robust , it is not without limitations . First , this model cannot eliminate serendipity in the R & D process . Rather , it allows for the fact that human beings’ current scientiﬁc and technological knowledge does not guarantee a 100 % “rational” drug research process and that the emergence of new compounds largely de - pends on luck . While our model is an attempt to approach ideal quality science , it does not ensure quality science in itself . Sec - ond , we designed the model based on the scenario of a phar - maceutical company in - licensing from several small biotechs within the same therapeutic area . Thus , we do not consider pharmaceutical R & D in different therapeutic areas . Neverthe - less , we believe that future research centered on the “R” - to - “D” transition should signiﬁcantly deepen our understanding of the pharmaceutical industry . Third , for the sake of the model’s sim - plicity , we do not consider the situation in which compounds generated by different biotechs act on different targets but are used for the same indication . In this scenario , the compounds that act in different ways to treat the same disease may poten - tially be given at the same time ; thus , the compounds created by different biotechs would be complementary rather than sub - stitutive . We encourage researchers to modify this model by 660 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT , VOL . 58 , NO . 4 , NOVEMBER 2011 including more parameters and take complementary compounds into consideration . Future research could also adopt a game the - ory approach by probing small biotechs’ reactions to pharmas who they learn are using this strategy . In this case , it is possible that biotechs would intentionally postpone their submissions to pharmas if the time value was not important ; in other words , if they knew that an early - submitted compound might be “frozen” by their “big brother . ” Regardless of these considerations , just as Dr . D . Vasella , Chairman and CEO of Novartis AG said in an interview with Business Today [ 9 ] , “We can never read the future . . . [ and ] you are constantly dealing with uncertainty” . We hope the model we have developed here provides a simple but useful strategy that a pharmaceutical company can use to manage its in - licensing activities and reduce uncertainty in its decision making .

Proof of Lemma 2 Proof : We have k nm 1 > (cid:5) k + 1 n m 1 + k k + 1 P (cid:6) γ k ⇔ m 1 > (cid:5) k + 1 k m 1 + n k + 1 P (cid:6) γ k ⇔ m 1 > (cid:5)(cid:5) 1 + 1 k (cid:6) m 1 + n k + 1 P (cid:6) γ k . It is easy to see that as k increase , the right - hand side of the inequality will decrease . Therefore , all k > k ∗ satisﬁes the inequality , when k ∗ satisﬁes it . At the same time , we have k ( n − k ) n ( n − 1 ) m 2 > [ n − ( k + 1 ) ] ( k + 1 ) n ( n + 1 ) m 2 γ k ⇔ 1 > (cid:5) n − k − 1 n − k (cid:6) (cid:5) k + 1 k (cid:6) γ k ⇔ 1 > (cid:5) 1 − 1 n − k (cid:6) (cid:5) 1 + 1 k (cid:6) γ k . It is easy to see that as k increase , the right - hand side will decrease . Therefore , all k > k ∗ satisﬁes the inequity , when k ∗ satisﬁes the inequity . The proof is complete . (cid:2) B . Proof of Theorem 1 Proof : From Lemma 2 , we have that for all k (cid:4) > k , k (cid:4) n m 1 > (cid:5) k (cid:4) + 1 n m 1 + k (cid:4) k (cid:4) + 1 P (cid:6) γ k (cid:4) k (cid:4) ( n − k (cid:4) ) n ( n − 1 ) m 2 > [ n − ( k (cid:4) + 1 ) ] ( k (cid:4) + 1 ) n ( n + 1 ) m 2 γ k (cid:4) . Next , we will prove it by backward mathematic induction . It is clear that the statement holds when k (cid:4) = n . Assume that when k (cid:4) ≥ i + 1 , we all have J k (cid:4) ( R k (cid:4) , r ) = k (cid:4) n m 1 + ( n − k (cid:4) ) k (cid:4) n ( n − 1 ) m 2 + P 1 r = 0 − B 1 r = 1 . Hence , when k (cid:4) = i , J i ( R i , r ) = max (cid:3) i nm 1 + ( n − i ) i n ( n − 1 ) m 2 + P 1 r = 0 − B 1 r = 1 , − g + γ i E r (cid:4) ( J i + 1 ( r (cid:4) ) ) + P 1 r = 0 − B 1 r = 1 (cid:4) = max (cid:3) i nm 1 + ( n − i ) i n ( n − 1 ) m 2 + P 1 r = 0 − B 1 r = 1 , − g + γ i (cid:5) i + 1 n m 1 + [ n − ( i + 1 ) ] ( i + 1 ) n ( n − 1 ) m 2 + i i + 1 P − 1 i + 1 B (cid:6) + P 1 r = 0 − B 1 r = 1 (cid:4) = max (cid:3) i nm 1 + ( n − i ) i n ( n − 1 ) m 2 + P 1 r = 0 − B 1 r = 1 , − g − γ i 1 i + 1 B + γ i (cid:5) i + 1 n m 1 + i i + 1 P (cid:6) + γ i [ n − ( i + 1 ) ] ( i + 1 ) n ( n − 1 ) m 2 + P 1 r = 0 − B 1 r = 1 (cid:4) = i nm 1 + ( n − i ) i n ( n − 1 ) m 2 + P 1 r = 0 − B 1 r = 1 .
