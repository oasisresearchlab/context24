nature neurOSCIenCe VOLUME 15 | NUMBER 3 | MARCH 2012 431 a r t I C l e S Fragile X syndrome ( FXS ) is the most common inherited form of intel - lectual disability and a leading genetic cause of autism 1 , 2 . FXS is caused by transcriptional silencing of the FMR1 gene , which encodes fragile X mental retardation protein ( FMRP ) —an RNA - binding protein that regulates translation of its interacting mRNAs 2 . Most people with FXS show many neurological deficits , including low intelligence quotient , seizures , sensory hypersensitivity , social anxiety , hyperactivity and other characteristics of autism 3 , 4 . In the mouse model of FXS , Fmr1 knockout , plasticity that is dependent on group 1 metabotropic receptor ( mGluR1 and mGluR5 ) stimulation of protein synthesis is enhanced and dysregulated 5 . These findings motivated the ‘mGluR theory of FXS’ , which posits that altered mGluR - dependent plasticity contributes to the pathophysiology of the disease 6 – 8 . In support of the mGluR theory , many phenotypes in animal models of FXS are reversed by pharmaco - logical or genetic reduction of mGluR5 or downstream signaling pathways 7 , 8 . Notably , a recent report indicates that mGluR5 antagonism can be an effective therapeutic strategy in patients with FXS 9 . Group 1 mGluR activation stimulates de novo protein synthesis in neurons , and evidence suggests that FMRP suppresses translation of specific mRNA targets downstream of mGluR activation 2 . In FXS , the loss of an FMRP - mediated ‘brake’ is proposed to lead to excess mGluR5 - driven translation of many FMRP target mRNAs , which in turn leads to an excess of mGluR - dependent plasticity 6 , 8 . Although mGluR5 antagonism rescues many phenotypes associated with FXS , it is unknown whether these phenotypes are due to excess mGluR5 - driven translation . Other evidence suggests there may be altered mGluR5 function that is upstream of translation in Fmr1 − / y brains . Although total mGluR5 levels are normal in Fmr1 − / y forebrain , there is less mGluR5 in the postsynaptic density ( PSD ) fraction and an altered balance of mGluR5 association with short and long isoforms of the postsynaptic scaffold - ing protein Homer 10 . The N - terminal EVH1 ( Ena - VASP homology ) domain of Homer proteins binds the intracellular C - terminal tail of group 1 mGluRs ( mGluR5 and mGluR1a ) and affects their trafficking , localization and function 11 . Long , constitutively expressed forms of Homer ( Homer1b , 1c , 2 and 3 ) multimerize through their C - terminal coiled - coil domains and localize mGluRs to the PSD through inter - actions with SHANK ( SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains protein ) , as well as link mGluRs to signaling pathways through Homer interactions with phosphoinositide - 3 kinase enhancer ( PIKE ) , elongation factor 2 kinase ( EF2K ) and the inositol - 1 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate receptor 11 , 12 . Homer1a ( H1a ) , a short , activity - inducible form of Homer , lacks the coiled - coiled domain and cannot multimerize with other Homers . Consequently , H1a disrupts mGluR5 – long Homer complexes , alters mGluR signaling and causes constitutive , agonist - independent activity of mGluR1 and mGluR5 ( ref . 13 ) . In Fmr1 − / y mice , mGluR5 is less associated with the long Homer isoforms and more associated with H1a ( ref . 10 ) . We hypothesized that the altered balance in mGluR5 interactions with Homer isoforms contributes to the mGluR5 dysfunction and pathophysiology of FXS . To test this hypothesis , we crossed Fmr1 − / y mice with mice selectively lacking the H1a isoform of Homer1 ( H1a − / − ) and determined whether H1a deletion restored mGluR5 function and Homer interactions , as well as neurophysiological and behavioral phenotypes of Fmr1 − / y mice . In addition , we determined whether acute peptide - mediated disruption of mGluR5 - Homer scaffolds in wild - type ( WT ) mice 1 Department of Neuroscience , University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center , Dallas , Texas , USA . 2 Department of Psychiatry , University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center , Dallas , Texas , USA . 3 The Solomon H .

Here we provide evidence that altered mGluR5 - Homer scaffolds contribute to mGluR5 dysfunction and phenotypes in the fragile X syndrome mouse model , Fmr1 knockout ( Fmr1 − / y ) . In Fmr1 − / y mice , mGluR5 was less associated with long Homer isoforms but more associated with the short Homer1a . Genetic deletion of Homer1a restored mGluR5 – long Homer scaffolds and corrected several phenotypes in Fmr1 − / y mice , including altered mGluR5 signaling , neocortical circuit dysfunction and behavior . Acute , peptide - mediated disruption of mGluR5 - Homer scaffolds in wild - type mice mimicked many Fmr1 − / y phenotypes . In contrast , Homer1a deletion did not rescue altered mGluR - dependent long - term synaptic depression or translational control of target mRNAs of fragile X mental retardation protein , the gene product of Fmr1 .

Our results indicate that altered Homer isoform interactions are responsible for much , but not all , of the mGluR5 dysfunction and pathophysiology of FXS . Specifically , H1a deletion did not rescue the protein synthesis independence of mGluR - dependent long - term synaptic depression ( mGluR - LTD ) or altered translation of FMRP target mRNAs . The latter results sup - port an essential role for FMRP in translational control of its known target mRNAs and mGluR - LTD . Our results provide new evidence for altered mGluR5 - Homer scaffolds in Fmr1 knockout phenotypes and implicate different mechanisms of mGluR5 dysfunction in distinct phenotypes . Modulation and restoration of mGluR5 - Homer inter - actions may represent a new therapeutic strategy for FXS and related cognitive and autistic disorders . RESULTS Disruption of mGluR5 - Homer regulates signaling to translation To investigate whether the altered mGluR5 - Homer scaffolds con - tribute to the mGluR5 dysfunction in Fmr1 − / y mice , we determined whether disruption of mGluR5 - Homer scaffolds with a peptide in WT mice mimics mGluR5 signaling alterations in the Fmr1 − / y mice . The rationale for this approach is based on data that H1a - bound mGluR5 , which is increased in the Fmr1 − / y , is functionally equiva - lent to mGluR5 that cannot interact with any Homer isoform 13 – 15 . To disrupt mGluR5 - Homer , we incubated acute hippocampal slices from WT mice in a cell - permeable ( Tat - fused ) peptide containing the proline - rich motif ( PPXXF ) of the mGluR5 C - terminal tail that binds the EVH1 domain of Homer , mGluR5CT ( YGRKKRRQRRR - ALTPPSPFR ) 14 , 16 , 17 . mGluR5CT reduced mGluR5 - Homer interactions to 41 ± 6 % of that observed in slices with no peptide treatment ( n = 3 mice ; P = 0 . 003 ) as determined by coimmunoprecipitation of mGluR5 and Homer ( Fig . 1a ) . Notably , mGluR5CT peptide treatment roughly mimicked the 50 % decrease in mGluR5 – long Homer interaction observed in Fmr1 − / y hippocampal lysates ( described below ) . As a control , slices were incubated in a peptide with a mutated Homer binding motif , mGluR5MU ( YGRKKRRQRRR - ALTPLSPRR ) 14 , 16 . mGluR5MU peptide had no effect on mGluR - Homer by compari - son with slices with no peptide treatment ( 103 ± 8 % of untreated ; n = 3 ; Fig . 1a ) . Fmr1 − / y mice show a deficit in stimulation of protein synthesis by mGluR1 and mGluR5 that may be a result of altered mGluR5 - Homer interactions . Previously , we reported that mGluR5CT peptide - mediated disruption of mGluR5 - Homer interactions in rat hippocampal slices inhibits group 1 mGluR activation of the phosphoinositide - 3 kinase ( PI3K ) – mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) protein kinase pathway and of translation initiation . However , mGluR5CT does not inhibit mGluR activation of the mitogen - activated protein kinase 1 ( ERK ) pathway 17 . Here we observed similar effects in hippocampal slices from WT mice . mGluR5CT peptide incubation blocked acti - vation of PI3K - mTOR pathway in response to the group 1 mGluR agonist ( RS ) - 3 , 5 - dihydroxyphenylglycine ( DHPG ; 100 µ M ; 5 min ) as measured by phosphorylation of mTOR on Ser2448 and p70 ribosomal S6 kinase ( S6K ) on Thr389 ( phospho - mTOR : mGluR5MU : 196 ± 27 % of basal , n = 8 ; mGluR5CT : 94 ± 20 % of basal , n = 8 ; P < 0 . 01 ; phospho - S6K : mGluR5MU : 300 ± 80 % of basal , n = 6 ; mGluR5CT : 114 ± 13 % of basal , n = 6 ; P < 0 . 05 ; Fig . 1b , c ) and had no effect on activation of the ERK pathway as measured by phosphorylation of ERK on Thr202 and Tyr204 ( mGluR5MU : 495 ± 117 % of basal , n = 4 ; mGluR5CT : 477 ± 162 % of basal , n = 4 ; not significant ; Fig . 1d ) 17 . The mGluR5CT peptide did not affect basal levels of phospho - mTOR , phospho - S6K or phospho - ERK ( Supplementary Table 1 ) 18 . Homer and mGluR5 each directly interact with another transla - tional regulatory factor , EF2K 12 . Although phosphorylation of elongation factor 2 ( EF2 ) by EF2K inhibits translation elongation globally , EF2K is required for translational activation of mRNAs c P - S6K MU B D B D CT S6K Tubulin * DH P G - s t i m u l a t ed P - S 6 K ( % o f ba s a l ) 400 MU CT 300 200 100 0 a IB : mGluR5 Homer Input IP : lgG IP : Homer – – – MU MU MU CT CT CT 1 . 5 * * I mm unop r e c i p i t a t ed m G l u R 5 / H o m e r ( no r m a li z ed t o no pep t i de ) 1 . 0 0 . 5 0 None MU CT b P - mTOR MU B D B D CT mTOR Tubulin * * DH P G - s t i m u l a t ed P - m T O R ( % o f ba s a l ) 250 MU CT 200 150 100 50 0 d P - ERK ERK Tubulin B D B D MU CT DH P G - s t i m u l a t ed P - E R K ( % o f ba s a l ) 800 MU CT 600 400 200 0 e P - EF2 MU B D B D CT EF2 Tubulin * DH P G - s t i m u l a t ed P - E F 2 ( % o f ba s a l ) 800 MU CT 600 400 200 0 Figure 1 Peptide - mediated disruption of mGluR5 - Homer scaffolds in WT mouse hippocampus bidirectionally regulates group 1 mGluR signaling to translation initiation and elongation .

A moder - ate inhibition of elongation globally by EF2K is thought to release translation factors that are then available for translational activation of poorly initiated transcripts . Unexpectedly , mGluR5CT - treated slices showed a robust increase in phosphorylation of EF2 on Thr56 in response to DHPG ( 590 ± 118 % of basal ; n = 15 slices , Fig . 1e ) in comparison to mGluR5MU - treated slices ( 294 ± 63 % of basal ; n = 15 ; P < 0 . 05 ) . Similar results were obtained in rat hippocam - pal slices ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . The mGluR5CT peptide did not affect basal levels of phospho - EF2 ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . Taken together , our data suggest that Homer interactions facilitate mGluR activation of the PI3K - mTOR pathway to translation initiation , but dampen mGluR - induced phosphorylation of phospho - EF2 and thus restrain inhibition of global elongation rates . Consequently , disrup - tion of mGluR5 - Homer would be expected to block mRNA translation by blocking activation of the PI3K - mTOR pathway and translation initiation and enhancing inhibition of elongation to a level that may block elongation of all transcripts , including Arc . Consistent with this model , disrupting mGluR5 - Homer interactions in hippocampal slices with mGluR5CT peptide blocked DHPG - induced synthesis of Arc ( mGluR5MU : 122 ± 5 % of untreated , n = 7 ; mGluR5CT : 95 ± 7 % of untreated , n = 7 ; Supplementary Fig . 1 ) and elongation factor 1 α ( EF1 α ) 17 . Deletion of Homer1a rescues mGluR signaling in Fmr1 − / y mGluR5 – long Homer interactions are reduced in Fmr1 − / y mice , and we hypothesize that this contributes to altered mGluR5 function . If so , then mGluR signaling to translation in Fmr1 − / y slices may mimic what is observed with mGluR5CT peptide treatment of WT slices ( Fig . 1 ) . In support of our hypothesis , DHPG - induced activation of PI3K , mTOR and S6K is deficient in Fmr1 − / y hippocampal slices , and ERK activation is unaffected 18 – 20 ( Fig . 2b ) . Furthermore , DHPG - induced phosphorylation of EF2 was enhanced in Fmr1 − / y slices relative to that in slices from WT littermates ( WT : 787 ± 135 % of untreated , n = 7 mice ; Fmr1 − / y : 1 , 452 ± 176 % of untreated , n = 6 mice ; Fig . 2c ) . Notably , these alterations in mGluR signaling parallel what was observed with mGluR5CT peptide treatment of WT slices ( Fig . 1 ) . Basal levels of phosphorylated or total EF2 or S6K were unchanged in Fmr1 − / y slices ( Supplementary Table 2 ) 18 . These results indicate that mGluR5 function is not generally enhanced or decreased in Fmr1 − / y mice , but is changed in a complex way that is mimicked in WT mice by disruption of mGluR5 - Homer interactions . In Fmr1 − / y mice , mGluR5 is more associated with H1a ( ref . 10 ; Supplementary Fig . 2a ) . Because long Homers compete with H1a for interactions with their effectors 14 , 15 , we hypothesized that genetic deletion of H1a in Fmr1 − / y mice may restore normal mGluR5 – long Homer interactions and mGluR5 function . To test this idea , we bred Fmr1 − / y mice with mice with a genetic deletion of H1a to create H1a − / − Fmr1 − / y double knockout mice 21 . H1a − / − mice have normal levels of long Homer isoforms 1 , 2 and 3 ( ref . 21 ) . In agreement with previous results 10 , coimmunoprecipitation of long Homer isoforms from Fmr1 − / y forebrain revealed a reduced association of mGluR5 in comparison to that in WT littermates ( Fig . 2a ) , whereas coimmuno - precipitation of H1a revealed an increased association with mGluR5 ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . Total levels of mGluR5 and long Homer proteins and of H1a protein and mRNA in Fmr1 − / y hippocampi were not different from those in WT ( Fig . 2a and Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . Genetic deletion of H1a restored normal mGluR5 - Homer interactions in Fmr1 − / y mice ( n = 4 mice per genotype ; Fig . 2a ) but did not affect levels of mGluR5 , long Homers or their interactions on a WT back - ground ( Fig . 2a and Supplementary Fig . 2 ) 21 . To determine whether H1a deletion restored normal mGluR5 signaling in Fmr1 − / y mice , we examined mGluR signaling to the mTOR and EF2K translational regulatory pathways . The deficit in mGluR5 signaling to mTOR in the Fmr1 − / y , as measured by S6K Thr389 phosphorylation ( WT : 242 ± 34 % of basal , n = 21 ; Fmr1 − / y : 135 ± 15 % , n = 19 ; Fig . 2b ) , was restored in the H1a − / − Fmr1 − / y ( 220 ± 28 % of untreated , n = 18 ) . Similarly , enhanced mGluR activation of EF2K was rescued to WT levels by Figure 2 mGluR5 - Homer scaffolds and group 1 mGluR signaling are altered in Fmr1 – / y mice and rescued by genetic deletion of H1a . ( a ) Decreased mGluR5 – long Homer interactions in the Fmr1 – / y hippocampus were restored to WT levels in H1a – / – Fmr1 – / y littermates . mGluR5 coimmunoprecipitation ( IP ) with Homer was quantified and normalized to immunoprecipitated Homer . Left : representative blots ( IB ) from one set of littermates reveal a decrease in the amount of mGluR5 that coimmunoprecipitated with Homer in Fmr1 – / y that was reversed in the H1a – / – Fmr1 – / y mouse . One - fifth of the input for the IP was run on separate blots and demonstrates normal levels of mGluR5 and Homer across all genotypes . Right : group data from independent co - IPs in four litters reveal a reliable decrease in mGluR5 - Homer co - IP ( expressed as a ratio of immunoprecipitated mGluR5 / Homer ) in Fmr1 – / y mice and rescue by H1a deletion . ( b ) Treatment of acute hippocampal slices from littermates of each of the four genotypes with DHPG ( 100 µ m ; 5 min ) revealed a deficit in phosphorylation of S6K in Fmr1 – / y mice that was restored to WT levels in the H1a – / – Fmr1 – / y .

H1a − / − mice showed normal DHPG - induced phosphorylation of EF2 ( 796 ± 159 % of untreated , n = 6 ) and S6K ( 227 ± 34 % of treated , n = 14 ) . There was no effect of Fmr1 or H1a genotype on basal levels of phosphorylated or total EF2 or S6K ( Supplementary Table 2 ) . Furthermore , DHPG treatment did not alter levels of total EF2 or S6K in any genotype ( Supplementary Table 2 ) 17 , 19 . H1a deletion rescues enhanced translation rates in Fmr1 − / y Although DHPG - induced translation is absent in Fmr1 − / y mice , basal translation rates in brain are elevated 2 , 8 , 20 , 22 . Enhanced protein synthesis in hippocampal slices was reversed by pharmacological blockade of mGluR5 or of ERK activation , but not by an inhibitor of PI3K or of mTOR 20 ( Fig . 3 and Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . Another consequence of mGluR5 - H1a interactions is constitutive , or agonist - independent , mGluR5 activity 13 , which may drive translation rates through ERK activation , a pathway that remains intact in Fmr1 − / y mice and with Homer disruption ( Fig . 1d ) 18 , 20 . In support of this hypothesis , genetic deletion of H1a rescued enhanced translation rates as measured by incorporation of 35 S - labeled methionine and cysteine in proteins in hippocampal slices ( Fmr1 − / y : 122 ± 4 % of WT , n = 14 slices from 7 mice ; H1a − / − : 102 ± 4 % of WT , n = 8 slices from 150 100 50 0 35 S - M e t + C ys i n c o r po r a t i on ( % o f W T ) 35 S - M e t + C ys i n c o r po r a t i on ( % o f M U ) 35 S - M e t + C ys i n c o r po r a t i on ( % o f M U ) 35 S - M e t + C ys i n c o r po r a t i on ( % o f W T v eh i c l e ) W T WT WT b c a d f e WT WT – – + + MPEP P - ERK ERK eIF4E Tubulin P - 4EBP ( Ser65 ) 4EBP P - eIF4E P - ERK ERK eIF4E DH P G - s t i m u l a t ed e I F 4 F c o m p l e x ( % ba s a l ) Tubulin P - 4EBP ( Ser65 ) P - 4 EBP ( S 65 ) / 4 EBP no r m a li z ed t o W T P - e I F 4 E / e I F 4 E no r m a li z ed t o W T 4EBP P - eIF4E 0 250 200 B IP : eIF4G IB : eIF4E InputeIF4E eIF4G IB : eIF4G B B B D D D D F m r 1 – / y Fmr1 – / y Fmr1 – / y Fmr1 – / y H 1a – / – H1a – / – Fmr1 – / y H1a – / – F m r 1 – / y H 1a – / – W T MU CT MU CT Vehicle U0126 0 F m r 1 – / y H 1a – / – F m r 1 – / y H 1a – / – W T W T F m r 1 – / y H 1a – / – F m r 1 – / y H 1a – / – F m r 1 – / y Fmr1 – / y H 1a – / – F m r 1 – / y H 1a – / – W T F m r 1 – / y H 1a – / – F m r 1 – / y H 1a – / – 150 100 50 0 150 P - ERK 100 50 M PEP / ba s a l ( % ) M PEP / ba s a l ( % ) P - 4EBP ( Ser65 ) P - eIF4E WT * * * * * * * * * * * * * Fmr1 – / y 100 50 150 0 2 . 0 100 50 150 50 0 500 100 150 1 . 5 1 . 0 0 . 5 0 1 . 5 1 . 0 0 . 5 0 400 300 200 100 0 * * Figure 3 Altered mGluR5 - Homer scaffolds in Fmr1 – / y mice mediate enhanced basal translation rates and initiation complex formation .

Furthermore , mGluR5CT peptide - mediated disruption of mGluR5 - Homer in WT slices was sufficient to mimic the enhanced protein synthesis rates observed in Fmr1 − / y slices ( mGluR5CT = 123 ± 6 % of mGluR5MU treated , n = 16 slices per peptide from 10 mice ; P = 0 . 002 ; Fig . 3b ) . In contrast , mGluR5CT had no effect on pro - tein synthesis rates in Fmr1 − / y slices ( mGluR5CT = 106 ± 8 % of mGluR5MU treated , n = 14 ( mGluR5CT ) or 15 ( mGluR5MU ) slices from 8 mice ; P = 0 . 5 ; Fig . 3b ) . Translation initiation is the rate - limiting step in translation 23 . To determine whether enhanced translation rates in the Fmr1 − / y stem from increased initiation , we measured eIF4F translation initiation complexes in hippocampal slices prepared from WT , Fmr1 − / y , H1a − / − and H1a − / − Fmr1 − / y mice . The eIF4F complex is composed of the 5 ′ cap binding protein eIF4E , the scaffolding protein eIF4G and the RNA helicase eIF4A 23 . eIF4F complex assembly can be measured by coimmunoprecipitation of eIF4G and eIF4E and is stimulated by DHPG in WT animals 24 . Therefore , we also measured eIF4F com - plex in DHPG - stimulated slices from each genotype . Consistent with previous reports 19 , eIF4F complex levels were enhanced basally in Fmr1 − / y slices and no longer stimulated by DHPG ( Fig . 3d ) . Like 35 S - labeled methionine and cysteine incorporation , eIF4F complex levels in Fmr1 − / y slices were restored to WT levels by H1a deletion ( Fig . 3d ; n = 3 mice per condition ) . Genetic deletion of H1a also rescued the deficit in DHPG - stimulated eIF4F complex assembly in the Fmr1 − / y ( Fig . 3d ) . These results suggest that elevated protein synthesis rates in Fmr1 − / y mice are due to enhanced translation initiation that is driven by H1a - bound mGluR5 . The deficit in mGluR - stimulated translation initiation in Fmr1 − / y mice may be because eIF4F complex levels are saturated basally . Furthermore , mGluR - activation of mTOR is rescued in Fmr1 − / y mice by H1a deletion ( see Fig . 2 ) , which may also contribute to restoration of DHPG - induced eIF4F complex assembly 24 . To determine how increased H1a - mGluR5 interactions lead to enhanced signaling to translation downstream of ERK , we examined phosphorylation of initiation factors known to be regulated by ERK in WT and Fmr1 − / y cortical homogenates and the effects of H1a deletion . ERK phosphorylates and activates MAPK - interacting kinase ( Mnk ) , which in turn phosphorylates the cap - binding protein eIF4E on Ser209 ( ref . 23 ) . ERK also phosphorylates eIF4E binding protein ( 4EBP ) at Ser65 , a site distinct from mTOR - regulated sites ( Thr36 and Thr45 ) 25 . ERK - dependent phosphorylation of eIF4E and 4EBP ( Ser65 ) is associated with increased translation rates in neurons and other cell types 24 , 26 . Consistent with a role for ERK in phosphorylation of these initiation factors in hippocampal slices , phospho - ( Ser209 ) - eIF4E and phospho - ( Ser65 ) - 4EBP were strongly reduced or abolished by treatment with U0126 , an inhibitor of the upstream kinase that WT 100 1 1 DHPG DHPG DHPG DHPG 1 , 2 1 , 2 1 , 2 1 , 2 2 2 50 F P s l ope ( % ba s e li ne ) F P s l ope ( % ba s e li ne ) F P s l ope ( % ba s e li ne ) F P s l ope ( % ba s e li ne ) 0 100 50 0 100 50 0 100 50 0 0 20 40 Time ( min ) Fmr1 – / y H1a – / – H1a – / – Fmr1 – / y 60 Control ( n = 7 ) Control ( n = 11 ) Control ( n = 6 ) Control ( n = 7 ) Cycloheximide ( n = 8 ) Cycloheximide ( n = 8 ) Cycloheximide ( n = 6 ) Cycloheximide ( n = 9 ) 80 0 a c b d 40 20 Time ( min ) 60 80 0 20 40 Time ( min ) 60 80 0 20 40 Time ( min ) 60 80 WT Map1b e CaMKII α Actin Fmr1 – / y F m r 1 – / y F m r 1 – / y H1a – / – H 1a – / – H 1a – / – Fmr1 – / y H1a – / – F m r 1 – / y H 1a – / – F m r 1 – / y H 1a – / – 1 . 5 1 . 5 * * * * * * * * 1 . 0 1 . 0 0 . 5 0 . 5 M ap1b / a c t i n C a M K II α / a c t i n 0 0 W T W T WT B B B B D D D D 150 100 DH P G - s t i m u l a t ed A r c ( % ba s a l ) 50 0 f Arc ERK Fmr1 – / y H1a – / – Fmr1 – / y H1a – / – * * * F m r 1 – / y H 1a – / – F m r 1 – / y H 1a – / – W T Figure 4 Genetic deletion of Homer1a does not reverse the protein synthesis independence of mGluR - induced LTD or altered protein levels of FMRP target mRNAs .

Phospho - 4EBP and phospho - eIF4E levels were enhanced in cortical homogenates from Fmr1 − / y mice , an effect that was rescued by H1a deletion ( Fig . 3e ) . As reported in hippocampal slices ( Fig . 1d ) 17 , 20 , phospho - ERK levels were unchanged in Fmr1 − / y lysates ( Fig . 3e ) . To determine whether mGluR5 activity abnormally drives phospho - rylation of ERK , eIF4E and 4EBP ( Ser65 ) in Fmr1 − / y mice , we treated hippocampal slices from both WT and Fmr1 − / y mice with the mGluR5 inverse agonist 2 - methyl - 6 - ( phenylethynyl ) pyridine ( MPEP ; 10 µ M ) . MPEP treatment did not affect phospho - 4EBP or phospho - eIF4E in WT slices . However , in Fmr1 − / y slices , MPEP reduced phospho - 4EBP and phospho - eIF4E by ~ 50 % ( Fig . 3f ) . Unexpectedly , MPEP had no effect on phospho - ERK levels in either WT or Fmr1 − / y slices . These results support our hypothesis that H1a - mediated mGluR5 activity drives translation initiation through ERK phosphorylation of initia - tion factors . Because phospho - ERK levels are not affected by Fmr1 knockout or with MPEP , this suggests that mGluR5 may regulate accessibility or localization of eIF4E or 4EBP with ERK , as opposed to ERK activity per se . Altered LTD is not rescued by deletion of H1a In WT animals , mGluR - dependent LTD in the CA1 region of the hippocampus requires dendritic protein synthesis of FMRP - interact - ing mRNAs such as Arc and Mtap1b ( also known as Map1b ) 5 , 12 , 27 . Although mGluR activation induces robust LTD in Fmr1 − / y mice , mGluR - induced synthesis of Arc and Map1b is deficient and LTD is independent of new protein synthesis 5 , 12 . From this result , it has been suggested that loss of FMRP - mediated translational suppres - sion leads to enhanced steady - state levels of ‘LTD proteins’ that allow mGluR - LTD to persist without new protein synthesis 5 . Consistent with this hypothesis , elevated Map1b and Arc have been reported in Fmr1 − / y neurons 5 , 28 . Alternatively , H1a - bound and constitutively active mGluR5 , which drives total protein synthesis rates ( Fig . 3 ) 20 , could elevate LTD protein levels and lead to protein synthesis – independent LTD . To distinguish between these possibilities , we determined whether genetic deletion of H1a reverses the protein synthesis independence of mGluR - LTD and enhances levels of specific FMRP target mRNAs . To test the protein synthesis dependence of mGluR - LTD , we preincubated slices in the translation inhibitor cycloheximide ( 60 µ M ) . Although mGluR - LTD was reliably induced with DHPG in H1a − / − Fmr1 − / y mice ( 81 ± 3 % of baseline 60 – 70 min after DHPG application , n = 11 slices ) , LTD was not sensitive to cycloheximide ( 78 ± 1 % of baseline , n = 9 ) , and was similar to that in Fmr1 − / y mice ( control : 74 ± 4 % of baseline , n = 7 ; cycloheximide : 79 ± 3 % of baseline , n = 9 ; Fig . 4 ) 12 . LTD was inhibited by cycloheximide treatment in both WT ( control : 76 ± 1 % of baseline , n = 7 ; cycloheximide : 92 ± 4 % of baseline , n = 8 ; P = 0 . 002 ) and H1a − / − mice ( control : 65 ± 5 % of baseline , n = 6 ; cycloheximide : 88 ± 5 % of baseline , n = 6 ; P = 0 . 01 ; Fig . 4a , d ) . These results suggest that the altered mGluR5 - Homer scaffolds in Fmr1 − / y mice do not mediate the protein synthesis independence of mGluR - LTD . To determine whether H1a deletion in Fmr1 − / y mice rescues ele - vated steady state levels of LTD - promoting proteins or other FMRP target mRNAs , we performed western blots of Map1b , Arc and CaMKII α in hippocampal homogenates of WT , Fmr1 − / y , H1a − / − and H1a − / − Fmr1 − / y mice ( Fig . 4e ) . Map1b and CaMKII α were elevated in both Fmr1 − / y mice and H1a − / − Fmr1 − / y mice in comparison to WT and H1a − / − mice ( Fig . 4e ) , indicating that H1a deletion does not restore normal levels of Map1b and CaMKII α in Fmr1 − / y mice . Although we did not detect elevated steady - state protein levels of Arc in hippo - campal homogenates from Fmr1 − / y mice , we observed a deficit in DHPG - induced synthesis of Arc in hippocampal slices from Fmr1 − / y mice in comparison to WT ( WT : 140 ± 17 % of basal or untreated , n = 12 ; Fmr1 − / y : 98 ± 12 % of untreated , n = 12 ; Fig . 4f ) . However , H1a deletion did not restore mGluR - induced synthesis of Arc in Fmr1 − / y mice 12 ( H1a − / − Fmr1 − / y : 91 ± 12 % of untreated , n = 11 ) . DHPG - induced synthesis of Arc was normal in H1a − / − mice ( 139 ± 11 % of untreated , n = 11 ) . These results show that altered mGluR5 - Homer scaffolds in the Fmr1 − / y mice do not mediate abnormal mGluR - LTD or altered translational control of specific FMRP target mRNAs . Instead , these results support an essential role for interaction of FMRP with its target mRNAs in mGluR - LTD and translational control of these mRNAs 2 , 29 . mGluR5 - Homer and hyperexcitable neocortical circuits Humans with FXS and Fmr1 − / y mice show sensory hypersensitivity , epilepsy and / or audiogenic seizures suggestive of an underlying sen - sory circuit hyperexcitability 3 , 8 .

Neocortical slices of Fmr1 − / y mice have decreased excitatory drive onto layer 4 fast - spiking interneurons and prolonged thalamically evoked and spontaneously occurring persistent activity , or UP , states 30 , 31 . UP states represent a normal physiological rhythm generated by the recurrent neocortical synaptic connections and are observed in alert and slow - wave sleep states in vivo , as well as in neocortical slice preparations 32 , 33 . Of note , genetic or pharmacological reduction of mGluR5 in Fmr1 − / y mice rescues the prolonged UP states in acute slices and in vivo 31 . To determine whether altered mGluR5 - Homer interactions contribute to altered neocortical circuit function and hyperexcitability in Fmr1 − / y mice , we measured spontaneously occurring UP states in acute slices from somatosensory barrel cortex using extracellular multiunit record - ings 32 . As previously reported 30 , 31 , UP states were longer in slices from Fmr1 − / y mice than in those from WT littermates ( WT : 797 . 4 ± 31 . 5 ms , n = 22 slices ; Fmr1 − / y : 1 , 212 ± 87 . 9 ms , n = 13 ; Fig . 5a , b ) . In support for a role for altered Homer interactions , UP state duration was shortened to WT levels by H1a deletion ( H1a − / − Fmr1 − / y : 872 . 2 ± 42 . 1 ms , n = 44 ; Fig . 5a , b ) . Loss of H1a alone did not affect UP states , ruling out general alterations in excitability ( H1a − / − : 767 . 7 ± 35 . 8 ms , n = 18 ) . We next determined whether mGluR5CT peptide - mediated disrup - tion of mGluR5 - Homer was sufficient to prolong UP states in WT slices . Preincubation of WT neocortical slices in mGluR5CT peptide increased the duration of UP states in comparison to treatment with mGluR5MU control peptide ( WT mGluR5MU : 909 . 8 ± 103 . 7 ms , n = 13 slices ; WT mGluR5CT : 1 , 408 . 8 ± 156 . 4 ms , n = 15 ; Fig . 5c , d ) . Therefore , acute disruption of mGluR5 - Homer complexes is sufficient to mimic the circuit hyperexcitability in Fmr1 − / y mice . In contrast , mGluR5CT had no effect on the duration of UP states in Fmr1 − / y slices ( Fmr1 − / y mGluR5MU : 2 , 014 . 9 ± 117 . 9 ms , n = 15 ; Fmr1 − / y mGluR5CT : 1 , 819 . 8 ± 163 . 8 ms , n = 12 ; Fig . 5c , d ) , likely because Homer complexes are already disrupted in these mice . H1a deletion reverses Fmr1 − / y behavioral phenotypes To determine whether H1a deletion rescues any in vivo or behavioral phenotypes in Fmr1 − / y mice , we measured the incidence of audio - genic seizures and anxiety as measured using the open field activity test across the four genotypes . We chose these phenotypes because they are robust in the C57BL6 strain of Fmr1 − / y mice and sensitive to mGluR5 antagonists 8 . Consistent with previous reports , Fmr1 − / y mice showed increased seizure incidence and severity upon exposure to a loud sound relative to WT and H1a − / − mice , who exhibited little or no incidence of seizure ( seizure score ( 0 – 3 ; 3 being most severe ; see Online Methods ) : WT , 0 . 12 ± 0 . 12 ; n = 16 mice ; H1a − / − : 0 . 04 ± 0 . 04 ; n = 24 ; Fmr1 − / y : 1 . 6 ± 0 . 2 ; n = 39 ; P < 0 . 001 , Fmr1 − / y versus WT or H1a − / − ; Fig . 6a and Supplementary Table 3 ) . H1a − / − Fmr1 − / y mice responded with a reduced incidence and severity of seizure in com - parison to Fmr1 − / y littermates ( H1a − / − Fmr1 − / y mice , seizure score 1 . 1 ± 0 . 2 ; n = 37 ; P < 0 . 05 , H1a − / − Fmr1 − / y versus Fmr1 − / y ) . However , H1a − / − Fmr1 − / y mice showed increased seizures in comparison to WT or H1a − / − mice ( P < 0 . 001 ; Fig . 6a ) . Such a partial rescue of the audiogenic seizures by H1a deletion is similar to what is observed with genetic reduction of mGluR5 in Fmr1 − / y mice 7 . As previously reported , Fmr1 − / y mice spent more time in the center of a lit open field than WT littermates , which has been interpreted as reduced generalized anxiety in the mice 34 ( Fig . 6b ; WT , 85 ± 8 s ; n = 18 mice ; Fmr1 − / y , 138 ± 12 ; n = 24 ; P < 0 . 01 ) . H1a − / − mice did not differ from WT mice in this behavior ( H1a − / − , 75 ± 10 s ; n = 17 ) . We found that H1a − / − Fmr1 − / y mice behaved like WT mice ( H1a − / − Fmr1 − / y , 91 ± 10 s ; n = 17 ) , spending significantly less time than Fmr1 − / y mice ( P < 0 . 01 ) in the center of an open arena . There were no differences in locomotor activity between any of the genotypes ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . Therefore , H1a deletion completely rescued the open field activity phenotype , suggesting that altered mGluR5 - Homer inter - actions contribute to altered behavior in Fmr1 − / y mice and may be relevant for altered behaviors in people with FXS . DISCUSSION Two mechanisms for mGluR dysfunction in FXS Here we demonstrate a causative role for reduced Homer scaffolds in mGluR5 dysfunction in a model of human neurological disease . MGluR5 dysfunction in animal models of FXS is well established , and genetic or pharmacological reduction of mGluR5 activity reduces or rescues many disease phenotypes in animal models 8 and most recently in patients 9 . However , the molecular basis for mGluR5 dysfunction in FXS was essentially unknown . It has been suggested that loss of an FMRP - mediated translational ‘brake’ downstream of mGluR5 leads to enhanced mGluR5 function 6 , 8 , but this mechanism cannot account for the deficits in mGluR5 signaling or translation - independent dysfunction of mGluR5 associated with FXS 18 , 31 . Our results reveal two mechanisms for mGluR5 dysfunction in Fmr1 − / y mice . First , an imbalance of mGluR5 interactions from long to short Homer1a isoforms leads to altered mGluR5 signaling , enhanced basal translation rates , neocortical hyperexcitability , audiogenic sei - zures and open field activity ( Supplementary Fig . 6a ) . Because H1a - bound mGluR5 is constitutively active or agonist independent , our results strongly suggest that the therapeutic action of mGluR5 inverse agonists , such as MPEP 13 , in FXS phenotypes are due , in part , to inhibition of H1a - bound , constitutively active mGluR5 . Second , our results reveal that disrupted Homer scaffolds in Fmr1 − / y mice cannot account for altered mGluR - LTD or abnormal translational control of FMRP target mRNAs ( Supplementary Fig . 6b ) and implicate an essential role for FMRP binding to and translational regulation of specific mRNAs in mGluR - LTD . The discovery that altered Homer scaffolds account for much of the complex dysfunction of mGluR5 in FXS will help to develop alternative , targeted therapies for the disease and provide mechanistic links to other genetic causes of autism . Homer scaffolds coordinate mGluR regulation of translation Our data demonstrate new functions of Homer scaffolds in coordi - nation of mGluR - stimulated translation by facilitating activation 2 . 0 a b * * * * * * * * * * * 200 150 100 50 0 1 . 5 1 . 0 A ud i ogen i c s e i z u r e sc o r e T i m e i n c en t e r ( s ) 0 . 5 0 WT Fmr1 – / y H1a – / – Fmr1 – / y H1a – / – WT Fmr1 – / y H1a – / – Fmr1 – / y H1a – / – Figure 6 H1a deletion reduces audiogenic seizures and corrects open field activity in the Fmr1 – / y mouse .

Homer links to PIKE , a small GTPase that binds and activates PI3K in response to mGluR activation 11 . The PI3K pathway stimulates mTOR to phosphorylate eIF4E binding protein ( 4EBP ) , which in turn releases eIF4E to interact with eIF4G and form the eIF4F translation initia - tion complex 23 . Furthermore , mTOR phosphorylates S6K to stimulate translation of 5 ′ terminal oligopyrimidine tract ( 5 ′ TOP ) mRNAs that encode ribosomal proteins and translation factors , thus increasing the translational capacity of the cell 23 . mGluR activation of the PI3K - mTOR - S6K pathway was blocked by mGluR5CT , and the deficits in mGluR activation of mTOR and initiation complex ( eIF4F ) formation in Fmr1 − / y mice were restored by H1a deletion , indicating that Homer scaffolds are key for mGluR - stimulated translation initiation 18 . Although somewhat counterintuitive given the fact that mGluRs stimulate translation initiation , mGluRs also stimulate phosphoryla - tion of EF2 , which inhibits elongation rate 12 . EF2K and moderate inhibition of elongation are necessary for mGluR - induced synthesis of Arc , as well as mGluR - LTD 12 . Submaximal inhibition of global elon - gation may make available rate - limiting factors to translate mRNAs that are poorly initiated and cannot compete effectively for these factors 35 . Long Homer interactions limit EF2K activation by mGluRs and thus would be expected to temper mGluR - mediated inhibition of general elongation and , in turn , promote translation of poorly initiated mRNAs 12 . Consequently , disruption of mGluR5 - Homer enhances EF2K activity and would be expected to strongly inhibit elongation and block translational activation . Although we did not rescue abnormal mGluR - LTD in Fmr1 − / y neurons by deletion of H1a , in WT slices mGluR5CT peptide treatment blocked mGluR - induced synthesis of Arc and mGluR - LTD 18 . These results indicate that in WT neurons , where mGluR - LTD requires de novo protein synthesis , mGluR5 - Homer interactions are necessary to properly stimulate translation and induce LTD . In Fmr1 − / y mice there was a deficit in mGluR stimulation of PI3K - mTOR and eIF4F initiation complex formation , whereas EF2K acti - vation was markedly enhanced . These changes would be expected to block mGluR - induced translational initiation and strongly inhibit elongation . mGluR - induced rapid synthesis of many proteins ( for example , PSD - 95 , EF1 α , amyloid precursor protein , Arc , CaMKII α and Map1b ) is absent in Fmr1 − / y mice 2 , which may be mediated , in part , by disrupted mGluR - Homer scaffolds and altered signaling to the translation machinery . Alternatively or in addition , because FMRP interacts with these mRNAs , it is likely required for mGluR - triggered translational activation of specific target mRNAs 2 , 29 . The fact that H1a deletion rescues mGluR - mediated translation initiation complex formation but not synthesis of Arc suggests a requirement for both mGluR5 - Homer scaffolds and FMRP in mGluR - triggered Arc translation . Altered mGluR5 - Homer scaffolds increase translation rates Although there is a deficit in mGluR agonist – stimulated translation in Fmr1 − / y mice , steady - state translation rates and levels of specific proteins are elevated 19 , 20 , thus reflecting the complexity of transla - tional control . Because one function of FMRP is to suppress transla - tion of its mRNA targets 2 , an obvious possibility was that the elevated protein synthesis rates and protein levels directly result from loss of FMRP - mediated suppression of mRNA targets . In support of this hypothesis , H1a deletion does not reverse enhanced protein levels of Map1b and CaMKII α . However , elevated total protein synthesis rates and translation initiation ( eIF4F ) complexes were rescued by H1a deletion and mimicked in WT mice by mGluR5CT peptide treatment . Thus , increased steady - state translation rates in Fmr1 − / y tissue are a result of altered mGluR5 - Homer scaffolds that are a secondary con - sequence of FMRP loss . Elevated protein synthesis rates in Fmr1 − / y hippocampal slices are reversed by the genetic reduction of mGluR5 ( Grm5 + / − ) , the mGluR5 inverse agonist MPEP and inhibitors of ERK 8 , 20 . In Fmr1 − / y cortical lysates , we observed enhanced phospho - rylation of translation initiation factors that are downstream of ERK ( eIF4E and 4EBP ) that was reversed by H1a deletion . Furthermore , blocking mGluR5 activity with MPEP strongly reduced phospho - eIF4E and phospho - 4EBP in Fmr1 − / y , but not WT , hippocampal slices . Together these results suggest that H1a - bound and constitu - tively active mGluR5 in Fmr1 − / y neurons 13 drives ERK - dependent phosphorylation of eIF4E and 4EBP , which enhances eIF4F initiation complex formation and translation rates . Because we do not observe an effect of Fmr1 − / y or MPEP on phospho - ERK levels as detected by western blot , this suggests that mGluR5 either drives ERK activity that is not detectable by phosphorylation at Thr202 and Tyr204 and / or regulates accessibility of eIF4E and 4EBP to ERK . In contrast to hippocampus , recent results from neocortical synapto - neurosomes of Fmr1 − / y mice demonstrate a role for PI3K activity in enhanced protein synthesis rates 22 . We observed that the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin equalized translation rates between WT and Fmr1 − / y hippocampal slices , but this was because wortmannin actually increased translation rates in WT , but not Fmr1 − / y , slices ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . Furthermore , elevated basal phosphorylation of PI3K , mTOR and 4EBP ( at the mTOR sites ) was recently reported in fresh hippocampal lysates of Fmr1 − / y mice , perhaps as a result of increased PIKE 19 , 20 . Although we are unable to detect elevated basal activation of the PI3K - mTOR pathway in our slice preparation 18 , per - sistent activation of downstream effectors of PI3K and mTOR together with constitutive mGluR5 - driven ERK may elevate translation rates in Fmr1 − / y mice . Phospho - EF2 levels are unchanged in Fmr1 − / y slices , suggesting that basal or constitutive mGluR5 activity is not sufficient to activate EF2K . The detailed mechanisms by which ERK , PI3K and mTOR , and EF2K contribute to elevated basal protein synthesis rates in Fmr1 − / y mice requires further study and may differ depending on the brain region , subcellular compartment or preparation . H1a deletion and restoration of mGluR5 - Homer scaffolds in Fmr1 − / y mice did not rescue the protein synthesis independence of mGluR - LTD nor elevated steady - state levels of Map1b and CaMKII α proteins produced from FMRP target mRNAs . This supports the hypothesis that the protein synthesis independence of mGluR - LTD in Fmr1 − / y mice is a result of loss of FMRP - mediated translational sup - pression of LTD - promoting proteins , such as MAP1b 36 . Because H1a deletion rescued the elevated incorporation of 35 S - labeled methionine and cysteine , but not altered mGluR - LTD and enhanced MAP1b and CaMKII α levels , this suggests that altered LTD and elevated MAP1b and CaMKII are not a result of elevated total protein synthesis rates . Furthermore , the fact that mGluR - triggered Arc synthesis was not res - cued by H1a deletion supports an essential role for FMRP in mGluR - triggered translational activation of Arc . Recent work has implicated mGluR - triggered dephosphorylation of FMRP in translational acti - vation of FMRP target mRNAs , such as Dlgap3 ( SAPAP3 ) and Dlg4 ( PSD95 ) ( refs . 2 , 29 ) . Altered mGluR5 - Homer and neocortical network dysfunction Altered neocortical circuit function and hyperexcitability have been predicted to contribute to cognitive disorders and autism 37 , 38 . The epi - lepsy and electroencephalographic abnormalities observed in people with FXS are indicative of brain hyperexcitability 3 , 8 . Furthermore , these individuals are hypersensitive to sensory stimuli , and Fmr1 − / y n p g © 2012 N a t u r e A m e r i ca , I n c . A ll r i gh t s r ese r ve d . nature neurOSCIenCe VOLUME 15 | NUMBER 3 | MARCH 2012 439 a r t I C l e S mice have audiogenic seizures reflecting hyperexcitability of sensory circuits 3 , 8 . Although UP states are a normal physiological rhythm and are not epileptiform activity , they provide an effective readout of the state of circuit function and excitability 32 . Furthermore , UP states underlie the slow oscillations that occur during slow wave sleep and are implicated in memory consolidation , as well as sensory process - ing in waking states 33 . Therefore , altered neocortical UP states in the Fmr1 − / y mouse 30 , 31 may be relevant to the sensory processing and cognitive abnormalities in humans with FXS . Our findings indicate that the longer UP states in Fmr1 − / y neocortex are mediated by enhanced , likely constitutive , activity of H1a - bound mGluR5 ( ref . 31 ) . In support of this conclusion , prolonged UP states in the Fmr1 − / y mouse are reversed by genetic or acute , pharmacologi - cal blockade of mGluR5 ( ref . 31 ) and genetic deletion of H1a . Peptide - mediated disruption of mGluR5 - Homer interactions prolonged UP states in WT , but not Fmr1 − / y , slices , which suggests that regulation of Homer scaffolds , by H1a or other means , may regulate neocortical slow oscillations in the normal brain . Of note , H1a is induced in neocortex with sleep deprivation and contributes to the homeostatic increase in slow wave sleep that occurs in response to sleep depri - vation 39 . Consequently , altered UP states , Homer interactions and responses to H1a may contribute to the reported sleep problems in people with FXS 4 . How does mGluR5 activity lead to longer UP states ? Prolonged UP states are not due to mGluR5 - driven translation , because the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin does not affect UP state dura - tion in either WT or Fmr1 − / y slices 31 . Therefore , mGluR5 activity likely leads to prolonged UP states through post - translational regulation of the intrinsic excitability and / or synaptic function of neocortical neurons . Altered behavior in Fmr1 − / y mice is rescued by H1a deletion Genetic reduction of mGluR5 ( heterozygosity ) , or H1a deletion , completely rescues neocortical hyperexcitability ( for example , long UP states ) in Fmr1 − / y mice , but only partially rescues audiogenic sei - zures 7 , 31 . This suggests that hyperexcitability in other brain regions , such as the auditory brain stem , also contributes to audiogenic sei - zures in Fmr1 − / y mice , through mechanisms independent of mGluR5 and H1a 40 . Notably , mGluR5 antagonism and H1a deletion rescued the increased open field activity in Fmr1 − / y mice , suggesting that abnormal Homer scaffolds contribute to behavioral symptoms asso - ciated with FXS and may represent a new therapeutic target for the disease . In contrast to initial studies 7 , 8 , 20 , recent reports have failed to rescue some Fmr1 − / y mouse behaviors by reduction of mGluR5 activity 41 , 42 , suggesting mGluR5 - independent mechanisms in FXS pathology . Of note , in these studies inhibition of mGluR1 proved efficacious in reducing some Fmr1 − / y phenotypes 41 , 42 . MGluR1a is a Homer binding protein , and mGluR1a - Homer scaffolds may also be affected in Fmr1 − / y mice . Alternatively , because of the diverse mRNA targets of FMRP 43 other signaling pathways are likely affected in FXS . However , because mGluR5 antagonism has proven effective in some FXS patients 9 , the understanding of mGluR5 function in the normal brain and its dysfunction in FXS may provide additional and more targeted treatments for the disease and provide insight into autism . For the phenotypes we studied here , H1a deletion had no effect in the WT background but only in the Fmr1 − / y background . This is likely because H1a expression is typically low under basal conditions and is strongly induced in response to neuronal activity and experience 11 . The effects of H1a induction in WT mice are expected to be mimicked by the mGluR5CT peptide , where we observe effects on mGluR5 sign - aling , protein synthesis rates , LTD 18 and UP state duration . In contrast , mGluR5CT peptide has no effect on these measures in Fmr1 − / y mice 18 . Therefore , we would expect that experience - dependent H1a induction would affect mGluR5 function in WT , but not Fmr1 − / y , mice . Such insensitivity to experience - induced H1a could contribute to deficits in experience - dependent plasticity associated with FXS 7 . Mechanism of disrupted Homer scaffolds in Fmr1 − / y How does loss of FMRP lead to altered mGluR5 - Homer scaffolds ? Protein levels of long Homers and H1a are unchanged in total homogenates of Fmr1 − / y hippocampi 10 , and FMRP is not reported to interact with mRNA for any Homer isoforms 43 . Previous work reported a decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation of long Homer in Fmr1 − / y forebrain 10 , but it is unknown whether or how this affects interactions with mGluR5 . Phosphorylation of Homer3 regulates interactions with other Homer effectors 44 , 45 . Similarly , phosphoryla - tion of mGluR5 at the C - terminal Homer interaction domain reduces the affinity of mGluR5 for Homer 46 . Therefore , post - translational modification of mGluR5 and / or Homer in Fmr1 − / y mice may underlie the decreased interactions . Disrupted or destabilized synaptic scaffolds that affect Homer and / or mGluR5 may also contribute more generally to cognitive disorders and autistic behaviors . Mutations in the Homer binding domain of SHANK3 and the Homer binding protein oligophrenin 1 are implicated in autism and intellectual disability , respectively 47 , 48 . Expression of a truncated SHANK3 without the Homer binding domain in mice results in degra - dation of SHANK3 and autistic behaviors in mice . Notably , reduction of long Homers or induction of H1a recapitulates the degradation of synaptic SHANK3 ( ref . 47 ) . One possibility is that mGluR5 dysfunction of the kind we describe here may occur in individuals with mutations in SHANK3 or other genes that destabilize Homer scaffolds .

Homer1a - specific knockout mice were generated as described 21 and backcrossed at least five generations onto the C57 / Bl6J mice from the University of Texas Southwestern mouse breeding core facility . All experiments were performed on littermate controls and blind to mouse genotype . Long Evans Hooded rats were obtained from Charles River Laboratories . Approximately 750 mice and 15 rats were used for experiments . Only male mice were used . The animal use protocols used in this manuscript were approved by the UT Southwestern Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee . Reagents . Drugs were prepared as stocks , stored at −20 °C and used within 2 weeks . The Tat - fused peptides mGluR5CT ( YGRKKRRQRRR - ALTPPSPFR ) and mGluR5MU ( YGRKKRRQRRR - ALTPLSPRR ) 16 were synthesized at the University of Texas Southwestern Protein Chemistry Technology Center . Peptide was dissolved in H 2 O at 5 mM , aliquoted and stored at −20 °C , and used at 5 µ M . Frozen aliquots were used within 10 d . The mixed group 1 mGluR agonist DHPG , U0126 and wortmannin were purchased from Tocris Bioscience and prepared as described 20 , 22 . Cycloheximide was purchased from Sigma and freshly prepared daily by dissolving directly in artificial cerebrospinal fluid ( ACSF ) . Hippocampal slice preparation and lTd recordings . Acute hippocampal brain slices were prepared from rats 3 – 6 weeks of age or WT , Fmr1 – / y , H1a – / y or H1a – / – Fmr1 – / y mouse littermates as described previously 18 . LTD recordings were performed and analyzed as described 18 . mgluR signaling in slices and western blotting . Western blotting on slices was performed as described 18 . Hippocampal slices were preincubated in a static incubation chamber in ACSF containing 5 µ M mGluR5CT or mGluR5MU for 4 h before DHPG treatment ( Fig . 1 ) or 30 min in MPEP ( 10 µ M ; Fig . 3f ) . Blotting membranes were incubated with the following antibodies according to the manufacturer’s instructions : phospho - ( Thr56 ) - EF2 , total EF2 , phospho - ( Thr389 ) - S6K , phospho - ( Ser2448 ) - mTOR , total mTOR , phospho - ( Thr202 and Tyr204 ) - ERK1 / 2 , total ERK1 / 2 , phospho - ( Ser209 ) - eIF4E , phospho - ( Ser65 ) - 4EBP , 4EBP , eIF4G , eIF4E ( all from Cell Signaling Technology ) , Homer ( Sc - 8921 ; Santa Cruz ) , mGluR5 ( Millipore ) , β 3 tubulin ( Abcam ) , Arc ( Synaptic Systems ) , Map1b ( gift from I . Fischer , Drexel University ) , CaMKII α ( Santa Cruz , sc - 5391 ) , actin ( Millipore , MAB1501 ) . For comparison of phosphoprotein levels across conditions or genotypes , immunoreactive phosphoprotein bands were normal - ized to total protein from the same slice homogenates ( for example , phospho - mTOR / mTOR immunoreactivity ratio ) , each of which was first normalized to loading control ( either tubulin , actin or total ERK as indicated ) . coimmunoprecipitation . Hippocampi were lysed in coimmunoprecipitation buffer ( 50 mM Tris , pH 7 . 4 , 120 mM NaCl , 0 . 5 % Nonidet P - 40 ) , and protein was tumbled overnight at 4 °C with 1 µ g of antibody ( either Homer ( Santa Cruz , D - 3 ) , Homer1a ( Santa Cruz , M - 13 ) or eIF4G ( Cell Signaling ) ) . Protein A / G agarose bead slurry ( Thermo Scientific ) was added for 1 h more , and the beads were then washed with coimmunoprecipitation buffer . Western blotting was performed with antibodies to Homer ( Santa Cruz , E - 18 sc - 8921 ) , Homer1a ( ref . 21 ) , mGluR5 ( Millipore ) , eIF4E ( Cell Signaling ) or eIF4G ( Cell Signaling ) . Full - length blots are shown in Supplementary Figures 7 – 10 . Real - time RT - PcR . Hippocampi were homogenized in TRIzol reagent ( Invitrogen ) followed by RNA extraction according to manufacturer’s protocol . RNA ( 2 µ g from each sample ) was subjected to first - strand cDNA syn - thesis by SuperScript III First - Strand synthesis system ( Invitrogen ) with two inde - pendent primers targeting the 3 ′ UTR of the mRNAs ( Homer1a : 5 ′ - GTG GTA AAG CTT TCC TTC AGA G - 3 ′ and 5 ′ - GGC ACC TCT GTG GGC CTG TGG - 3 ′ ; Gapdh : 5 ′ - GGT ATT CAA GAG AGT AGG GAG - 3 ′ and 5 ′ - GGG TGC AGC GAA CTT TAT TG - 3 ′ ) . PCR was performed by GoTag Green DNA polymerase ( Promega ) with specific primers against Homer1a ( 5 ′ - TGA TTG CTG AAT TGA ATG TGT ACC - 3 ′ and 5 ′ - GAA GTC GCA GGA GAA GAT G - 3 ′ ) 50 and Gapdh ( 5 ′ - AGG TCG GTG TGA ACG GAT TTG - 3 ′ and 5 ′ - TGT AGA CCA TGT AGT TGA GGT CA - 3 ′ ) . metabolic labeling of hippocampal slices . Hippocampal slices were prepared as described 18 , 20 . For these experiments ( Fig . 3 ) , the most ventral slices ( two per hippocampus ) were used because basal protein synthesis rates differ between dorsal and ventral hippocampal slices 20 . Slices recovered for 3 . 5 h in ACSF at 32 °C and then were incubated in actinomycin D ( 25 µ M ) for 30 min . Where indicated , 20 µ M U0126 or 100 nM wortmannin was added at this step . For experiments with mGluR5 peptides , slices were preincubated in ACSF containing 5 µ M mGluR5CT or mGluR5MU for 4 h before actinomycin incubation . neocortical slice preparation and UP state recordings . UP state experiments in neocortical slices were performed and analyzed as described 31 . To allow time for the mGluR5 peptides to permeate slices , the peptide - containing ACSF was perfused onto the slices in the interface chamber for 4 h before recording and was supplemented with 10 µ M HEPES buffer , pH 7 . 4 , 0 . 05 % BSA and 5 µ M of the appropriate peptide . The ACSF containing peptide and BSA was not oxygenated directly , but slices were oxygenated in the interface recording chamber . Audiogenic seizures . To evaluate audiogenic seizures , mice were placed in a plastic chamber ( 30 × 19 × 12 cm ) containing a 120 - dB siren ( GE 50246 personal security alarm ) , which was covered with a Styrofoam lid . The 120 - dB siren was presented to mice for 5 min . Mice were videotaped and scored for behavioral phenotype as described 7 : 0 = no response , 1 = wild running , 2 = tonic - clonic seizures , 3 = status epilepticus or death . Behavioral measurements . Open field activity . Mice were placed individually into the periphery of a novel open field environment ( 44 cm × 44 cm , walls 30 cm high ) in a dimly lit room and allowed to explore for 5 min . They were monitored from above by a video camera connected to a computer running video track - ing software ( Ethovision 3 . 0 , Noldus ) to determine the time , distance moved and number of entries into two areas : the periphery ( 5 cm from the walls ) and the center ( all areas excluding the periphery ) . The open field arenas were wiped and allowed to dry between mice . Time in the center was used as a measure of anxiety . Locomotor activity . Mice were placed individually into a new , plastic mouse cage ( 18 cm × 28 cm ) that was located inside a dark Plexiglas box . Movement was monitored by five photobeams in one dimension ( Photobeam Activity System , San Diego Instruments ) for 2 h , with the number of beam breaks recorded every 5 min . Data were analyzed with an analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) with genotype and time as the dependent variables . Statistics . Data plotted in the figures represent the mean ± s . e . m . Significant dif - ferences were determined using independent or paired t - tests ( for determining effects of mGluR5CT peptide ) . For comparisons between WT , Fmr1 – / y , H1a – / – and H1a – / – Fmr1 – / y , a two - way ANOVA and Bonferroni post - tests were used . For statistics on nominal data , such as seizure severity and incidence ( Fig . 6a and Supplementary Table 3 ) , a chi - squared ( Fisher’s exact ) test was used . Group data are presented in the figures as mean ± s . e . m . * P < 0 . 05 ; * * P < 0 . 01 ; * * * P < 0 . 001 . 49 . The Dutch - Belgian Fragile X Consortium .
