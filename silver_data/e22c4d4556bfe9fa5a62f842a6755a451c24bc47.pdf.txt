Vacuolating cytotoxin A ( VacA ) is a H . pylori pore - forming toxin and a key determinant of gastric cancer risk . VacA is secreted as an 88 - kDa polypeptide ( p88 ) that upon interaction with host cells induces cytotoxic effects , including cell vacuolation and mitochondrial dysfunction . These effects are currently believed to be due to VacA p88 accumulating inside host cells and forming oligomeric anion - specific channels in membranes of intracellular compartments . However , the molecular nature of intracellular VacA channels in host cells remains undefined . Here we show that VacA p88 does not accumulate inside human epithelial cells , but instead is rapidly processed in endosomes into smaller p31 / p28 and p37 products in a manner that precedes VacA - induced vacuolation . VacA processing requires endosomal acidification and concerted cleavage by multiple endo - lysosomal proteases including cathepsins . In situ structural mapping reveals that upon processing , the toxin’s central hydrophilic linker and globular C - terminus are excised , whereas oligomerization determinants are retained . Congruently , the processed products are constituents of a high - molecular - weight complex inside the host cell ─ which we propose is the intracellular , mature and active VacA pore . These findings suggest that VacA exploits human endosomes for proteolytic processing and intracellular activation . Significance Statement Helicobacter pylori is a cancer - causing bacterium that infects the stomach of billions of people worldwide . Vacuolating cytotoxin A ( VacA ) is an important H . pylori virulence factor and its activity directly correlates with gastric carcinogenesis . Yet despite decades of intense research , the mechanisms underlying VacA activity in human cells remain incompletely understood . Here , we present evidence suggesting that VacA is activated inside human cells by multi - step proteolytic processing involving endo - lysosomal proteases including cathepsins . We also track and identify the functional processed VacA isoforms in host cells . These results revolutionize our understanding of the mechanism of VacA activation in human cells , whilst expanding our knowledge of the diversity of microbial virulence factors that exploit human endo - lysosomes for pathogenesis . 4 Main Text Introduction Helicobacter pylori infection of the human stomach is the strongest risk factor for gastric cancer , the fourth leading cause of cancer - related death in the world ( 1 , 2 ) . In the face of decreasing efficacy of H . pylori eradication treatment due to burgeoning antibiotic resistance , WHO listed H . pylori among 16 antibiotic - resistant bacteria that pose the greatest threat to human health ( 3 ) . Vacuolating cytotoxin A ( VacA ) is a key H . pylori virulence factor and a drug and vaccine target involved in H . pylori colonization , persistence and pathogenesis ( 4 - 7 ) . The 88 - kDa mature secreted VacA ( designated p88 ) functions as a pore - forming toxin , but its primary and tertiary structure bear no similarity to other bacterial pore - forming toxins ( 8 , 9 ) . VacA is internalized by host epithelial cells via endocytosis ( 10 ) and acts intracellularly to induce cytoplasmic vacuolation ( 11 , 12 ) , mitochondrial dysfunction and endosomal trafficking perturbation ( 13 - 15 ) . A large body of epidemiological data indicate that VacA channel activity correlates with increased disease severity and a heightened gastric cancer risk ( 16 ) . Extensive biophysical studies show that VacA p88 exhibits weak anion - specific channel conductance in both artificial planar lipid bilayers and plasma membranes of intact epithelial cells ( 14 , 17 , 18 ) . Channel activity is strictly dependent on the ability of VacA to self - associate into higher - order oligomers ( 19 - 21 ) . Secreted VacA p88 consists of two domains , an N - terminal p33 domain and a C - terminal p55 domain , which are both essential to pore - forming activity and receptor - binding ( 13 ) . The two domains are connected by a central hydrophilic linker that is dispensable for anion channel activity and prone to proteolytic - nicking in vitro ( 22 - 24 ) . Recent high - resolution cryo - EM structures of water - soluble VacA p88 oligomers further suggests that this hydrophilic linker , likely located at the center of the flower - shaped VacA p88 hexamer ( Fig . 1 ) , is highly flexible in structure ( 8 ) . It was previously speculated that VacA resembled classical A - B toxins and might undergo proteolytic cleavage within the hydrophilic linker inside host cells ( 25 ) . Nevertheless , intracellularly processed functional VacA domains have not been reported to date . Meanwhile , a widely accepted model of VacA mechanism of action proposes that the p88 hexamer forms the active channel responsible for most of the toxin’s cellular effects ( 18 ) . The physiological significance of this model has not yet been rigorously examined . Despite VacA acting intracellularly as a pore - forming toxin ( 11 ) , knowledge of the physiological form inside the host cell is lacking . In this study , we directly address this key knowledge gap using an in situ structural mapping approach . The data provide crucial insights into the physiological form 5 of the VacA channel in human epithelial cells . Our findings suggest that VacA p88 undergoes rapid proteolytic modification and activation in the endosome of host cells prior to inducing vacuolation . Results VacA is processed by human epithelial cells . To gain insight into the physiological form of VacA inside human gastric epithelium , we developed domain - specific antisera capable of recognizing N - terminal p33 or C - terminal p55 domain regions of VacA ( SI Appendix , Fig . S1a , b ) . Using these antisera , we examined the steady - state levels of VacA in a human gastric adenocarcinoma ( AGS ) cell line infected with H . pylori 60190wt ( VacA + Hp ) . In addition to cell - associated VacA p88 , we detected novel forms of VacA as summarized ( Fig . 1a ) : the antiserum raised to the N - terminal p33 domain detected distinct proteins that migrated at 31 kDa ( p31 ) and 28 kDa ( p28 ) ( Fig . 1b ) , whereas the antiserum raised to the C - terminal p55 domain detected a distinct protein that migrated at 37 kDa ( p37 ) ( Fig . 1c ) . These proteins were derived from VacA p88 since they were absent from cells inoculated with a H . pylori 60190 VacA - null mutant ( VacA ‒ Hp ) or heart infusion broth ( HI ) culture media alone ( Fig . 1b , c ) . The observed processing of VacA was not limited to the AGS cell line but is likely a fundamental process since HeLa cells similarly treated with VacA - containing culture supernatant ( CS ) showed the same processed forms of VacA ( Fig . 1d , e ) . Multiple lines of evidence confirm that these VacA fragments are generated by precise intracellular processing and are not degradation products . First , even after 24 h incubation with AGS cells , the only antisera - reactive band detected in spent culture medium recovered from VacA - treated cells was p88 ( SI Appendix , Fig . S2a ) . This indicated that p28 , p31 and p37 do not arise from extracellular degradation of p88 . Second , endocytosis inhibitors cytochalasin D and EGA ( 26 ) that blocked uptake of VacA also prevented the generation of p31 , p28 and p37 ( SI Appendix , Fig . S2b , c ) , suggesting that these fragments arise only after VacA entry into the host cell . Third , VacA processing in AGS cells treated with proteasome inhibitor MG132 was indistinguishable from that in untreated cells ; this implies that proteasomal degradation does not contribute to the formation of p28 , p31 and p37 ( SI Appendix , Fig . S3a ) . Fourth , Atg8 family Hexa KO HeLa cells , which lack the six known Atg8s and are therefore deficient in autophagy ( 27 ) , processed VacA identically to wild - type HeLa cells ( SI Appendix , Fig . S3b ) , confirming that autophagy does not contribute to VacA processing . Finally , the physiological relevance of VacA processing was confirmed by the fact that similar processed fragments were observed in VacA - intoxicated human two - dimensional ( 2D ) primary gastric organoid - derived monolayers ( SI Appendix , Fig . S4 ) . Taken together , these observations strongly suggest that VacA is processed inside host cells into hitherto unknown fragments by intracellular proteases . 6 VacA processing correlates with function . Given that many intracellularly - acting bacterial toxins are activated inside the host cell ( 28 ) , we next investigated whether the VacA p28 / p31 and p37 fragments are associated with vacuolating activities . First , we assessed the kinetics of VacA processing and its relationship to vacuolation using a cumulative intoxication assay . By treating AGS cells for up to 6 h with VacA + , we found that both p31 and p37 were detectable as early as 1 h post - intoxication ( SI Appendix , Fig . S5a ) . Their emergence preceded the onset of vacuolation , as assayed by neutral red uptake ( NRU ) ( SI Appendix , Fig . S5c ) , and both fragments continued to accumulate over time . The accumulation of p28 started slightly later , at ~ 4 h post - intoxication ( SI Appendix , Fig . S5a ) . More importantly , experiments employing trypsin - shaving of VacA - intoxicated cells showed that VacA p88 accumulated only on the cell surface and not inside host cells ( SI Appendix , Fig . S5b ) . The most plausible explanation for these observations is that endocytosed VacA p88 is processed rapidly into specific fragments and hence does not accumulate inside the host cell . Thus , contrary to longstanding belief , these observations argue that VacA hexamers composed of p88 are unlikely to represent the intracellular physiological VacA channel , but rather a prepore state . To dissect the sequence of VacA processing and assess whether these processed products correspond with intracellular activities , we analyzed VacA - intoxicated cells in pulse - chase experiments . AGS cells were pulsed with VacA + for 30 mins , after which unbound toxin ( p88 ) was removed . Cell - associated VacA was then examined over time ( up to 10 h post - pulse ) by immunoblot analysis of intoxicated - cell lysates using p33 - or p55 - specific antisera ( Fig . 2a ) . Consistent with our previous observations of negligible intracellular p88 , increasing p31 and p37 levels directly correlated with declining p88 levels ( Fig . 2b , c , respectively ) . Additionally , p28 became detectable from 2 h post - pulse , with its accumulation coinciding with the loss of p31 over time ( Fig . 2b ) , suggesting a two - tiered processing of VacA in which p31 is further processed to yield p28 . By 8 h and 10 h post - pulse , p28 and p37 were the predominant forms of intracellular VacA . Strikingly , upon NRU analysis of a parallel set of identical VacA - pulsed AGS monolayers ( SI Appendix , Fig . S6a ) , we observed that VacA - mediated NRU was inversely proportional to p88 levels ( Spearman r = - 0 . 91 , p = 0 . 005 ) but positively correlated with increasing levels of processed VacA ( Spearman r = 0 . 93 , p = 0 . 002 ) ( Fig . 2d ; SI Appendix , Fig . S6b ) . This suggests that processed VacA , rather than full - length p88 , is responsible for vacuolation . To further examine this hypothesis , we tested whether depletion of processed VacA would lead to loss of vacuolating activity . For this , we pulsed cells with VacA + and then sampled cell lysates for immunoblot analysis ( anti - p55 ) and NRU assay at the later time points of 16 , 20 and 24 h post - pulse , thereby allowing for natural depletion of intracellular VacA ( Fig . 2a ) . An identical replicate set of VacA + - pulsed AGS cells were trypsin - shaved immediately before harvest to identify residual cell surface - bound p88 by 7 cleaving it into p33 and p55 , and analyzed by anti - p55 immunoblot ( Fig . 2e ) . These results showed that the gradual loss of vacuolating activity after 16 h mirrored the decreasing p37 levels , but did not correlate with p88 levels , which was shown to be entirely extracellular by trypsin - shaving ( Fig . 2e , f ) . Collectively , the findings from these pulse - chase experiments support a new model for VacA mechanism of action : VacA p88 , upon entry into host cells , is rapidly processed into p31 / p28 and p37 fragments that trigger robust vacuolation until their clearance from the cell . Fragments associate with early endosomes and form a protein complex . Since VacA exerts its vacuolating activity by functioning as an oligomeric anion channel in the endosomal membrane of host cells ( 10 , 14 , 19 - 21 , 29 , 30 ) , it is thus tempting to postulate that the processed VacA fragments p31 / p28 and p37 exist as an oligomeric complex in the host endosome . To address this hypothesis , we first examined the subcellular localization of p31 , p28 and p37 using sucrose density gradient centrifugation . Analysis of the AGS cell extracts showed that the processed VacA products p31 , p28 and p37 cofractionated substantially with the early endosomal marker Rab5 ( Fig . 3a ) , suggesting their localization in early endosomes ( fractions 4 – 6 ) ( 10 ) . In addition , p31 and p37 were also evident in the most prominent mitochondrial fractions ( fractions 7 , 8 ) . Mitochondrial outer membrane protein Sam50 cofractionated not only with the VacA processed fragments but also Rab5 , whereas cells treated with VacA – ( Fig . 3a ) displayed less Rab5 - Sam50 co - fractionation , observations that are consistent with a previous study demonstrating that VacA promotes endosome - mitochondria juxtaposition ( 31 ) . Together , these results support a model where p28 , p31 and p37 accumulate within endosomes and mitochondria - associated endosomes . Oligomerization is crucial for VacA to function as anion channels both in vitro and inside host cells ( 21 , 32 ) . We thus next interrogated whether p31 / p28 and p37 co - exist as oligomers in subcellular membranes using a 2D - PAGE approach . Employing non - denaturing BN - PAGE followed by SDS - PAGE , we analyzed an endosome - and mitochondria - enriched fraction of VacA - treated AGS cells . The data showed that subcellular organelle - derived VacA co - migrated as a protein complex containing p31 , p28 and p37 ( Fig . 3b ; SI Appendix , Fig . S7 ) . Taking into account the exaggerating impact of detergent / dye binding on membrane protein size estimation in BN - PAGE ( 33 ) , the results suggest that these complexes are hexameric , or higher - order oligomers that represent VacA anion channels in subcellular membranes . Fragments retain crucial VacA regions . To further elucidate the structural nature of the intracellular processed VacA , we employed mass spectrometry ( MS ) analysis to determine the amino acid sequences of the various VacA processed fragments . Tryptic / chymotryptic peptides yielded from p31 and p28 span amino acid residues G31 to K274 , indicating that both fragments contain β - strands 1 – 15 in the N - terminal p33 domain of VacA ( 8 ) ( Fig . 1a ; SI Appendix , Fig . S8a ; Table S1 ) . By comparing the intracellular processing of wild - type VacA with VacA ∆6 - 27 , we 8 discovered that p31 was replaced by a truncated form in cells infected with the VacA ∆6 - 27 strain , whereas wild - type VacA and VacA ∆6 - 27 both generated identical p28 forms ( SI Appendix , Fig . S8b ) . This reveals that the difference between p31 and p28 is the presence and absence , respectively , of the VacA N - terminus ( residues A1 - W30 ) , a key hydrophobic region involved in channel formation ( 34 ) . Given these results and the estimated molecular weight of the fragments , both p31 and p28 likely terminate at the beginning of the inter - domain hydrophilic linker , specifically at or around P294 ( Fig . 1a ) . Tryptic / chymotryptic peptides from VacA p37 spanned residues T337 to K689 of VacA p88 , corresponding to β - strands 1 – 29 in the C - terminal p55 domain ( 8 ) ( SI Appendix , Fig . S8a ; Table S1 ) , and p37 peptides containing a ragged N - terminus indicated that V339 is the N - terminal boundary of p37 ( SI Appendix , Table S1 ) . Thus , p37 contains the V339 - A350 segment that is essential for oligomer formation ( 30 , 35 ) via cradling of the p33 domain of the adjacent protomer , as shown in the cryo - EM structure of p88 oligomers ( 8 , 9 ) ( Fig . 1f ) . Collectively , these results reveal that the VacA processed fragments p31 , p28 and p37 contain crucial functional and structural determinants , and that both the central hydrophilic linker and the C - terminal ‘foot’ region are excised during VacA processing ( Fig . 1f ) . Processing involves endosomal acidification and cathepsins . Multiple disparate VacA cleavage sites together with the rapid p88 - turnover in host cells suggests that intracellular VacA processing occurs via a series of robust cleavage events . Many intracellularly - acting bacterial toxins and viral fusion proteins exploit endosomal acidification and endo - lysosomal proteases for proteolytic processing ( 36 - 38 ) . To first assess whether VacA processing requires endosomal acidification , AGS cells were treated prior to and during VacA + intoxication with the endosomal acidification inhibitors bafilomycin A1 ( vacuolar - H + - ATPase inhibitor ) or chloroquine ( acidotropic weak base ) . These inhibitors blocked p31 / p28 and p37 production ( Fig . 4a , b ) , resulting in p88 accumulation inside the intoxicated host cells as evidenced by the protection of a proportion of p88 from exogenous trypsin digestion ( Fig . 4a , b ) . Furthermore , treatment of cells with the acidotropic weak base ammonium chloride , commonly used to potentiate VacA - induced vacuolation , slowed p88 processing in VacA - intoxicated cells ( SI Appendix , Fig . S9 ) . This is consistent with observations of ammonium chloride - enhanced p88 intracellular persistence previously reported by Foegeding et al . ( 39 ) . Taken together , our findings that endosomal acidification inhibitors block intracellular p88 processing into p31 / p28 and p37 suggest that endosomal acidification is essential for intracellular processing of p88 . Interestingly , VacA processing in HeLa Vps39 knockout cells ( Vps39 KO ) , which lack a gene product essential for endosomal maturation ( 27 ) , yielded an additional band at ~ 47 kDa and a doublet at ~ 38 - 39 kDa , but no p37 ( SI Appendix , Fig . S3b ) ; this confirms the central role of the endosomal pathway in host - cell mediated VacA processing . 9 To further understand the molecular mechanism behind VacA processing , we used a panel of specific cathepsin inhibitors . The cathepsin family of proteases represent the main class of acid hydrolases in endosomes and lysosomes . Pre - treatment of AGS cells with Pepstatin A methyl ester ( a membrane - permeable cathepsin D and E inhibitor ) and E64d ( membrane - permeable and highly specific cathepsin B , H , L and K inhibitor ) yielded a p55 - reactive processed fragment slightly larger than the p37 fragment ( Fig . 4c ) , which was not observed when cells were treated with Pepstatin A methyl ester alone ( data not shown ) . These data suggest that cathepsins B , H , L and / or K is / are involved in VacA processing . In contrast , cathepsins C and S do not seem to be required as pretreatment with their corresponding specific inhibitors did not alter the cleavage pattern ( Fig . 4d ) . The fact that none of these protease inhibitors , either alone or in combination , resulted in complete blockade of VacA processing or vacuolation ( data not shown ) suggests that VacA processing is a robust and complex process involving multiple endo - lysosomal proteases . This is perhaps unsurprising given the proteolytic susceptibility of the flexible hydrophilic linker in VacA and the broad - spectrum substrate specificities of cathepsins . Discussion VacA is a key virulence factor of H . pylori and an important disease marker . The current understanding of its structure and function is largely based on extensive research on water - soluble VacA hexamers in vitro . It is speculated that the membrane - associated active VacA channel might be similar in structure to water - soluble VacA hexamers ( 8 , 40 ) , of which two high - resolution cryo - EM structures were recently published ( 8 , 9 , 40 ) . Despite these reasonable assumptions , the actual nature of the physiological intracellular anion channel has remained unknown since the discovery of VacA over thirty years ago ( 41 - 43 ) . Here , our data provide crucial insights into the intracellular active form of VacA and reveal a new paradigm of a bacterial pore - forming toxin that exploits the human endosome for spatiotemporal activation . Our findings suggest that the hydrophilic linker and globular C - terminus are excised from full - length VacA to generate functional N - terminal p31 / p28 and C - terminal p37 fragments in endosomes following endocytosis . A key discovery in this study is that the only VacA species accumulating in the endosome are the processed VacA fragments and not full length VacA . It is well established that vacuolation is caused by VacA functioning as anion channels in the endosomal membrane ( 14 , 44 ) . Thus , this novel finding has crucial implications because together with the strict temporal correlation of VacA processing with vacuole development and resolution , it argues unequivocally that the processed form , and not full length unprocessed VacA , is the active VacA form that causes vacuolation in the endosome . 10 The hydrophilic linker that separates the N - and C - terminal VacA domains is vulnerable to in vitro proteolytic nicking ( 22 , 23 , 45 ) and is dispensable for anion channel activity ( 24 ) , which led to speculation that VacA might represent a prototypical A - B type pore - forming toxin ( 25 , 46 ) . Recent cryo - EM structures of water - soluble hexamers predicted that the hydrophilic linker occupies the central cavity of oligomers ( 8 ) , in close proximity to an N - terminal glycine zipper - containing hydrophobic α - helix , which is essential for insertion of the functional channel into membranes ( 19 , 34 ) . Excision of the linker , as reported in this study , may represent the first step of VacA channel activation , whereby the N - terminal glycine zipper is dissociated from the linker facilitating membrane insertion following endocytosis ( Fig . 5 ) . Meanwhile , cleavage of the ‘foot’ in the globular C - terminus of VacA , speculated to be involved in host cell binding ( 47 ) , may help liberate VacA from bound host cell receptors within the endosome . Such molecular workings may be a crucial mechanism to ensure full channel activation only in intended environments , such as endosomes , and may serve to avoid non - specific membrane damage . Our findings clarify various longstanding unsettled issues related to the intracellular form of VacA . Previous studies based on ectopic expression of VacA constructs in HeLa cells suggest that the first 422 amino acid residues of VacA suffice to cause vacuolation ( 12 ) , but the implications of these observations remained unclear . In this study , our results suggest that VacA is processed within host cells to generate functional N - terminal p31 / p28 and C - terminal p37 fragments . Notably , these fragments together comprise the 422 amino acid residues in the aforementioned minimal vacuolation - competent VacA construct ( 12 ) minus the central hydrophilic linker ( 24 ) . Thus , our findings provide a plausible mechanistic explanation for these previously puzzling observations . Our findings also shed light on a twenty - year - old enigma in the field surrounding the ability of VacA to cause vacuolation despite deletion or substitution of the entire hydrophilic linker ( 24 ) . Our discovery that the hydrophilic linker is in fact excised during VacA proteolytic activation provides a logical explanation for these once intriguing observations . Finally , while some studies provided evidence that regions from both N - and C - terminal VacA domains were required for vacuolation ( 48 , 49 ) , one study showed that the N - terminal domain alone , when chemically crosslinked in vitro , was sufficient for anion channel activity ( 50 ) . The domain - specific VacA antibodies developed in this study have enabled us to clarify this discrepancy . Our data show that regions from both the N - and C - terminal domains comprise the intracellular and active VacA channel , with the premise that the N - terminal p31 / p28 processed fragments constitute the channel portion of the mature VacA pore , whereas the C - terminal p37 fragment plays a structural role to stabilize the oligomeric pore complex . The latter is in accordance with recent cryo - EM structural data and data from other studies showing that residues V339 - A350 , which are retained in fragment p37 , are important for toxin oligomerization and stability ( 8 , 30 ) . 11 There are two caveats in our findings that have implications for the complex intracellular mechanism of action of VacA . One concerns the observed sequential processing of p31 to p28 with an apparent loss of the N - terminal hydrophobic α - helix . Based on previous data ( 19 ) , one would expect loss of this helix to result in a non - functional VacA toxin . However , our pulse chase analyses suggest that p28 , like p31 , is functional . This apparent paradox could be explained if the hydrophobic N - terminal α - helix of VacA is required for membrane insertion and / or the initial formation of a functional channel , but is dispensable once the mature channel has formed in the endosome . Alternatively , in the mature VacA channel , the hydrophobic N - terminal α - helix of VacA may still be present but is no longer covalently - associated with the rest of the protein ; this is conceivable if the short linker immediately upstream of hydrophobic N - terminal α - helix would undergo a conformational change in the processed active VacA form that renders the linker more susceptible to proteolytic cleavage . Finally , although we have identified cathepsins B , H , K or L to be involved in host cell processing of VacA , we were unable to completely block processing despite an exhaustive screen of protease inhibitors . This suggests that VacA processing involves multiple proteases and / or that the VacA cleavage regions confer protease - promiscuity and redundancy . These features support the notion that VacA has evolved to undergo robust endosomal processing – which would be expected if the latter is an integral step in the intracellular activation of VacA in endosomes . VacA has been shown to exhibit weak anion channel activity in the plasma membrane of host cells ( 17 ) . Our findings are therefore in line with the model that VacA is capable of a ‘dual mode’ operation – the extracellular full length p88 channel is capable of exerting weak channel activity in the plasma membrane , whereas the processed form reported in this study is responsible for the more cytotoxic intracellular channel activities , including vacuolation , that need to be under tight spatiotemporal control . In summary , this study has redefined the physiological active form of VacA . It has provided data in support of a new model in which VacA exploits human endosomal machinery for intracellular activation . Thus , VacA , despite its unique features and functional properties , is reminiscent of some A - B toxins such as diphtheria toxin and anthrax toxin , whose cellular functions similarly rely on endosomal acidification and proteolytic activation ( 51 ) . Given the crucial role of VacA in H . pylori pathogenesis , future identification of the protease ( s ) responsible for VacA activation could open doors to therapeutic innovations to combat antibiotic - resistant H . pylori infection and the associated gastric cancer . 12 Materials and Methods Cell and bacterial culture - AGS cells , a human gastric adenocarcinoma cell line , and HeLa cells , including Hexa KO and Vps39 KO mutant HeLa cell lines ( SI Appendix , Table S4 ) , were grown in Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium ( DMEM ; Gibco ) supplemented with 10 % ( v / v ) fetal bovine serum ( FBS ; Serana ) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5 % CO 2 . H . pylori strains ( SI Appendix , Table S4 ) were routinely maintained and broth cultures prepared as described previously ( 52 ) . Mutant H . pylori strains – Donor DNAs for creating H . pylori vacA mutant strains were synthesized from H . pylori 60190 nucleotide sequence ( accession number U05676 ) and cloned into pUC57 ( Genscript ) in two overlapping parts : part A contained nucleotides 210 to 1420 , with nucleotides 597 to 600 substituted to GGAT to create a BamHI site ; part B contained nucleotides 1321 – 2884 and was synthesized as either untagged , or carrying extra nucleotides encoding a monoclonal antibody - recognizable Strep tag II epitope tag ( SAWSHPQFEK ) inserted after amino acid 234 ( p31 - tagged ) or 525 ( p37 - tagged ) . Part A was further modified by ligating a cat gene in the created BamHI site . Parts A and B were amplified using primer pairs VacA _ NtermF / R or VacA _ CtermF / R , respectively , and then part A was joined to one of each of the part B forms using splice - by - overlap PCR using primer pair VacA _ NtermF / VacA _ CtermR with Phusion DNA polymerase ( primers in SI Appendix , Table S5 ) . H . pylori 60190 VacA - null mutant ( VacA – Hp ) was naturally transformed using the spliced PCR products to produce tagged strains 60190 Str 234 and 60190 Str 525 . Transformants were selected on GC plates supplemented with 8 µg / ml chloramphenicol and screened for vacuolating activity , sensitivity to kanamycin , and insertion of the tag by colony PCR , where relevant . H . pylori culture supernatant ( CS ) preparation - Broth cultures of H . pylori strains 60190wt , 60190 VacA - null mutant or P12 were inoculated to an O . D 600 of 0 . 05 and grown for 24 hours ( h ) . Bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation at 4000 x g for 20 min and the supernatant filter - sterilized using Millipore EXPRESS ™ Plus 0 . 22 - μm membrane filter vacuum stericups . Sterile supernatants were three - times concentrated using Millipore Amicon Ultra - 15 centrifugal 3 , 000 nominal molecular weight limit ( NMWL ) ( Da ) cutoff units by centrifuging at 2500 x g for ~ 40 minutes ( min ) at 4 °C . HI or brain heart infusion broth ( BHI ) negative control was prepared in the same manner . Sterile , concentrated VacA + , VacA – and P12 CS were stored in aliquots at - 80 °C . Production of VacA p33∆6 - 27 and p55 recombinant proteins and specific polyclonal antisera - Plasmids carrying DNA encoding H . pylori 26695 VacA subunits p33∆6 - 27 and p55 were amplified using specific primer pairs p33F / p33R and p55F / p55R ( SI Appendix , Table S5 ) , respectively , and ligated into BamHI / SalI - linearized expression vector pQE - 30 ( Qiagen ) to produce pQE30 - p33∆6 - 27 and pQE30 - p55 . N - terminal His - tagged recombinant p33∆6 - 27 ( r - p33 ) and p55 ( r - p55 ) proteins 13 were expressed as inclusion bodies in E . coli BL21 - DE3 and BL21 - DE3 Codon Plus , respectively , by inducing a mid - log culture with 0 . 5 mM IPTG ( 3 h at 37 o C ) . Following cell lysis using lysis buffer ( 0 . 1 % ( v / v ) Triton X - 100 , 0 . 2 mg / ml lysozyme , 10 µg / ml DNaseI , 0 . 1 % ( v / v ) b - mercaptoethanol in PBS , pH 7 . 5 ) and homogenization ( Avestin cell crusher , 2 passes ) , inclusion bodies were pelleted ( 20 , 000 x g , 30 mins , 4 o C ) and solubilized overnight at 4 o C in binding buffer ( 4 M urea , 200 mM NaCl , 20 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 ) . His - tagged proteins were purified using Ni - NTA resin ( Promega ) ; bound proteins were washed with binding buffer and eluted into elution buffer ( 4 M urea , 200 mM NaCl , 400 mM imidazole , 20 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 ) . Purified proteins were concentrated by ultrafiltration ( Amicon Ultra - 4 , Millipore ) and diluted in PBS . For antisera production , New Zealand White rabbits were immunized with 250 µg recombinant protein in Freunds complete adjuvant , and boosted 4 times with 150 µg in Freunds incomplete adjuvant at 2 - 4 week intervals . Specificity of polyclonal antisera was confirmed against r - p33 and r - p55 proteins , and native H . pylori VacA protein by immunoblot . All animal work was compliant with the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council guidelines and approved by the Monash University School of Biomedical Sciences Animal Ethics Committee . Intoxication of cultured mammalian cells with VacA - AGS and HeLa cells for H . pylori CS - treatment experiments were grown to ~ 80 % confluence before the addition of three - times concentrated H . pylori CS to a final concentration of 20 % ( v / v ) in cell culture media , and incubated at 37 ° C for 24 h unless otherwise stated . AGS cells for supernatant time - course experiments were seeded at 7 . 5 x 10 4 cells per well in a 24 - well plate or 1 x 10 4 cells per well in a 96 - well plate and incubated with H . pylori CS the following day for the indicated durations . For pulse - chase experiments , cells were intoxicated for 30 mins with VacA + or VacA – before one wash with PBS to remove unbound toxin , fresh media was replaced in wells for the remainder of the experiment . For H . pylori co - culture experiments , AGS cells were seeded at 1 x 10 5 cells per - well in a 24 - well plate and incubated the following day with broth - cultured H . pylori strains ( moi = 30 ) or sterile HI broth for 24 h , as described previously ( 52 ) . For immunoblot analysis , cells were washed twice with PBS before whole cell lysates were prepared by harvesting the cells with hot Laemmli buffer . Alternatively , cells were trypsin - shaved , harvested for mitochondrial preparation or subcellular fractionation , or subjected to neutral red uptake assay as further described . For VacA inhibitor experiments , AGS cells were treated with endocytosis inhibitors : cytochalasin D ( 20 µM , Sigma ) or 4 - bromobenzaldehyde N - ( 2 , 6 - dimethylphenyl ) semicarbazone ( EGA ; 20 µM , Sigma ) ( 26 ) ; endosomal acidification inhibitors : bafilomycin A1 ( 62 . 5 nM , Invivogen ) , chloroquine ( 50 µM , Invivogen ) , ammonium chloride ( 5 mM , Sigma ) ; proteasomal degradation inhibitor : MG132 ( 5 – 50 µM , Merck KgaA ) ; cathepsin inhibitors : Pepstatin A methyl ester ( 10 or 20 µM , Merck , US1516485 - 1MG ) or E64d ( 20 µM , Merck , 88321 - 09 - 9 ) . All inhibitors were used both prior to ( 1 h ) and during 14 intoxication unless otherwise specified in figure legends . Culture media used in the aforementioned experiments was not supplemented with ammonium chloride unless otherwise stated . Culture and intoxication of human primary gastric organoids with VacA - This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki , and the protocol was approved by the Cabrini Research Governance Office ( CHREC 04 - 19 - 01 - 15 ) and the Monash Human Research Ethics Committee ( MHREC ID 2518 ) . Patient recruitment was led by surgeons in the Cabrini Monash University Department of Surgery . Gastric tissue was obtained from patients undergoing sleeve gastrectomy at the Cabrini Hospital , Malvern , Australia . All patients provided written consent . Patient - derived normal human gastric tissue was placed in cold 1X chelating buffer ( distilled water , 5 . 6 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 8 . 0 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 96 . 2 mM NaCl , 1 . 6 mM KCl , 43 . 4 mM sucrose , 54 . 9 mM D - sorbitol ) , then cut in small fragments , and washed in 1X chelating buffer until the supernatant was clear . Glands were extracted by incubating tissue fragments for 10 mins at RT in 1X cold chelating buffer containing 10 mM EDTA , then resuspended in Matrigel ( Corning , 356231 ) and seeded into 24 - well tissue culture plates . Once polymerized , Matrigel was overlaid with 500 µL of culture medium composed of advanced Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium ( DMEM ) / F12 ( Gibco , Cat # 12634028 ) supplemented with penicillin / streptomycin ( Gibco , Cat # 15140122 ) , 10 mM HEPES ( Gibco , Cat # 15630080 ) , GlutaMAX ( Gibco , Cat # 35050061 ) , 1xB27 ( Gibco , Cat # 17504044 ) , 100 ug / ml Primocin ( Invivogen , Cat # ant - pm - 2 ) , 10 mM nicotinamide ( Sigma , N0636 ) , 1 mM N - Acetylcysteine ( Sigma , A9165 ) , 50 ng / mL recombinant human epidermal growth factor ( EGF , PeproTech , Cat # AF - 100 - 15 ) , 10 % ( v / v ) noggin - conditioned medium , 10 % ( v / v ) R - spondin1 - conditioned medium , 50 % ( v / v ) Wnt - conditioned medium , 200 ng / mL recombinant human fibroblast growth factor 10 ( FGF10 , PeproTech , Cat # 100 - 26 - 500 ) , 1 nM gastrin ( Tocris , Cat # G9145 ) , 2 µM A - 83 - 01 ( Tocris , Cat # 2939 ) . Following initial seeding of the cultures , 5 µM Y - 27632 dihydrochloride kinase inhibitor ( MedChemExpress , HY - 10583 ) , and 3 µM glycogen synthase kinase ( GSK ) 3β inhibitor ( CHIR99021 , Axon Medchem ) . Medium was refreshened every 2 - 3 days . Organoids were passaged by mechanical disruption every 6 - 10 days as described previously ( 53 ) , or by enzymatic dissociation for seeding onto cell culture inserts as described below . Transwell cell culture inserts ( 12 well , 16 . 38 mm height , 0 . 4 µm pore size ) ( Sarstedt , Cat # 83 . 3931 . 041 ) were placed in 12 - well plates . Following the establishment of human gastric organoids in 24 - well plates , organoids were mechanically scraped and collected into a tube with cold advanced DMEM / F12 ( Gibco ) . Organoids were then centrifuged at 1500 rpm at 4° C for 5 mins , and supernatant discarded . Single cell suspension was obtained by treatment with TrypLE Express solution ( Gibco , Cat # 12604013 ) for 3 minutes at 37° C . Cell pellet was resuspended in 15 culture medium containing 5 µM Y - 27632 dihydrochloride kinase inhibitor ( MedChemExpress ) , and 150 µL of cell suspension per insert was seeded . Cells were cultured in 150 µL apical and 1 mL basal complete medium for the first week or until a homogeneous monolayer of cells was formed , containing 5 µM Y - 27632 dihydrochloride kinase inhibitor ( MedChemExpress ) for the first 3 days . Medium in the apical and basal compartments of the insert was refreshed every 2 - 3 days . Human 2D gastric organoids were intoxicated with three - times concentrated H . pylori CS to a final concentration of 20 % ( v / v ) in both apical and basal media compartments at 37 ° C for 24 h . For immunoblot analysis , 2D organoids were gently washed with PBS before whole cell lysates were prepared by harvesting 2D organoids in transwells with hot Laemmli buffer . Immunoblot analysis and antibodies - Samples denatured by boiling in Laemmli buffer containing 100 mM DTT were separated in 12 % SDS - PAGE gels according to the Laemmli buffer system and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for immunoblot analysis . Primary antibodies used were rabbit anti - p33 and anti - p55 ( this study ) ; rabbit anti - F1β ( 54 ) and anti - Sam50 ( 55 ) ; rabbit anti - Strep tag II and mouse anti - rab5 ( Abcam ) . Secondary antibodies were ECL anti - rabbit or anti - mouse IgG HRP - conjugated ( Amersham ) , and bound secondary antibody was detected using ECL Prime chemiluminescent substrate ( Amersham ) . Isolation of AGS endosomal / mitochondrial - enriched fraction - AGS cells were washed twice with ice - cold PBS and all subsequent steps were performed on ice or at 4 °C . Cells harvested by scraping were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 x g for 10 min and resuspended in isotonic Solution A ( 20 mM HEPES pH 7 . 5 , 220 mM mannitol , 70 mM sucrose , 1 mM EDTA and freshly added 0 . 2 mg / mL PMSF ) . Cells were lysed by repeated expulsion through a 22 - gauge needle . Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 1000 x g for 15 min and the resulting supernatant then centrifuged at 10 , 000 x g for 30 min to pellet mitochondria . The mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in Solution A and centrifuged again at 1000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C to pellet any remaining whole cells and contaminating nuclei . Mitochondria - enriched sample protein concentrations were determined by BCA assay ( Pierce ) and stored at - 80 °C . Mass spectrometry - SDS - polyacrylamide gel blocks corresponding to VacA fragments identified by parallel VacA immunoblot analysis were excised and subjected to in - gel digestion using trypsin ( Promega ) or chymotrypsin ( Promega ) and LC - MS / MS analysis as previously described ( 56 ) . Mass spectrometric raw data was processed and searched by Byonic software ( Protein Metrics , v2 . 6 . 46 ) ( 57 ) or MASCOT ( v2 . 4 ) . Search parameters include fully specific or semi specific tryptic / chymotryptic cleavage sites with up to 3 missed cleavages , cysteine carbamidomethylation as fixed modification and methionine oxidation as common variable modification . Database 16 searching was performed against H . pylori 26695 protein sequences downloaded from Uniprot ( Sep 2015 ) . Mass spectrometry peptide scores , data from Western blot and mutant analyses together with the protein molecular weight calculator , Compute pI / Mw ( 58 ) were used as criteria to predict the N - and C - terminal boundaries of the VacA fragments . Subcellular fractionation – VacA + - or VacA – - treated AGS cells were scraped from a 175 cm 3 flask into 0 . 5 mL of ice - cold homogenization buffer containing 250 mM sucrose , 1 mM EDTA , 10 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 4 , mini c0mplete TM EDTA - free protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) . Cells were homogenized on ice by repeated passage through a 22 - gauge needle and centrifuged at 800 x g at 4 °C for 10 min to pellet whole cells and nuclei . The resulting supernatant was overlaid on a 5 - step discontinuous sucrose gradient ( 2 . 28 mL each of 18 % , 27 % , 35 % , 43 % and 50 % ( w / v ) sucrose solutions in 10 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 4 , 1 mM EDTA ) and centrifuged at 100 , 000 x g at 4 °C for 19 h using a SW 40 Ti rotor . Gradients were collected from the top of the gradient into 12 equal fractions using a Brandel density gradient fractionation system ( Brandel / ISCO ) . The protein component of each fraction was precipitated by 10 % ( v / v ) TCA followed by acetone washes , separated by SDS - PAGE , and analyzed by immunoblot with various antibodies as specified in figure legends . Trypsin - shaving of AGS cells – AGS cells in 24 - well plates were washed twice with 500 µL / well of pre - warmed PBS before incubation with 150 µL / well of pre - warmed trypsin solution ( 0 . 25 % ( w / v ) trypsin , 0 . 91 mM EDTA , Gibco ) for 5 mins at 37 °C in the presence of 5 % CO 2 . Trypsin activity was quenched by the addition of 450 µL / well of pre - warmed DMEM supplemented with 10 % HI - FBS . AGS cells were centrifuged at 150 x g and the pellet resuspended in 1 mL of ice - cold PBS . The previous step was repeated once more before the cell pellet was homogenized in hot SDS Laemmli buffer and analyzed by immunoblot . Quantification of vacuolation – Neutral red dye uptake ( NRU ) assays were performed in 96 - well plates as previously described ( 59 , 60 ) with modifications . Briefly , 0 . 5 % neutral red dye ( Sigma - Aldrich ) stock solution was diluted in phenol red - free RPMI supplemented with 10 % HI - FBS and 20 mM HEPES pH 7 to make a 0 . 025 % neutral red dye working solution . AGS cells were treated with VacA + , VacA – or cell - culture medium ( mock - treated ) in triplicate wells per treatment condition for varying durations , as specified in figure legends . For pulse - chase NRU experiments in which the cells were pulsed with VacA + for 30 minutes , the culture media was supplemented with 5 mM ammonium chloride for the final 30 mins of incubation to potentiate vacuolation . For both accumulation and pulse - chase experiments , treatments were staggered so that all time - points finished simultaneously and all wells contained cells of the same culture duration post - seeding . At completion of treatment , cells were washed once with 150 µL / well pre - warmed PBS and incubated with 100 µL / well of pre - warmed neutral red dye working solution for 4 min at room temperature . Excess dye was removed by washing cells twice with 150 µL / well pre - warmed PBS and the dye 17 extracted with 100 µL / well of acidified alcohol ( 50 % ( v / v ) ethanol in 1 % ( v / v ) acetic acid ) . Within each experimental cohort , optical densities were read at 540 nm and the values standardized by subtraction of the median value of six parallelly mock - treated wells of AGS cells . Each experiment was performed three times with triplicate wells per condition included in each independent experiment . 2D - PAGE of AGS endosomal / mitochondrial - enriched fraction – Mitochondria - enriched fraction isolated from VacA + - treated AGS cells ( 24 h treatment ) was resuspended in digitonin lysis buffer ( 1 % ( v / v ) digitonin , 20 mM Tris HCl pH 7 . 4 , 0 . 1 mM EDTA , 50 mM NaCl , 10 % ( v / v ) glycerol , 1 mM PMSF ) and incubated on ice for 30 min with periodic vortexing . Samples were then centrifuged at 10 , 000 x g for 30 min and the solubilized mitochondrial proteins were collected in the supernatant . For the first dimension electrophoresis , the supernatant was combined with blue native ( BN ) sample buffer ( final 1X BN buffer of 1 % ( w / v ) Coomassie Brilliant Blue G - 250 , 100 mM 6 - aminocaproic acid , 20 mM Bis - Tris pH 7 ) and electrophoresed on a 4 – 16 . 5 % BN polyacrylamide gel . For the second dimension , the BN lane containing mitochondrial proteins was excised and washed gently for 1 min in SDS - PAGE running buffer , then encased orthogonally in a 4 % SDS - polyacrylamide stacking gel overlaying a 12 % SDS - polyacrylamide gel . SDS - PAGE and immunoblot analysis were performed as described . Statistical analysis – All statistical analysis was performed using Prism v 8 . 4 . 3 ( GraphPad ) and p - values < 0 . 05 were considered significant . Neutral red uptake data was statistically assessed in response to each treatment over time by comparison with t = 0 , wherein elevated optical density indicated vacuolation and reduced optical density indicated reduced cell viability . For the accumulation experiments ( SI Appendix , Figure S6c ) , the median data from each of three independent experiments was stacked in a spreadsheet sub - column and assessed by repeated measures two - way ANOVA with the Geisser - Greenhouse correction . For the pulse - chase NRU experiments ( SI Appendix , Figure S7a ) , the 0 . 5 – 10 h time - points and 16 – 24 h time - points were assayed separately so the data was left unmatched and analyzed by ordinary two - way ANOVA . In each NRU analysis , the two intra - assay covariates of treatment and time were assessed using Holm - Sidak multiple comparisons test with individual variances computed for each comparison , and the residuals were confirmed to distribute horizontally in residual and homoscedasticity plots , and diagonally in a QQ plot . Non - parametric analysis of a correlation between VacA fragments and vacuolation was performed by determining the Spearman r of VacA anti - p55 densitometry values against the NRU values obtained at identical time - points . Data in this analysis was compiled from 3 independent experiments : NRU data ( x - direction ) was a single median value per time ( independent replicates shown in SI Appendix , Figure S6a ) ; densitometry data ( y - direction ) was each independent 18 experimental value per time point . The 0 . 5 – 10 h and 16 - 24 h densitometry data were analyzed separately because they originated from different sets of immunoblots , but only the 0 – 10 h data had enough datapoints to generate p - values . Cubic spline curves generated with three knots were included in the correlation plots to aid in visualizing the correlation but are not part of the analysis .

Proposed model for VacA activation inside human endosomes : a new VacA intoxication paradigm . 1 ) The VacA hexamer is endocytosed by host cells ; 2 ) Endosomal acidification induces conformational change in the VacA oligomer that exposes previously protected residues to early endosomal proteases . The hydrophilic linker ( red ) and C - terminal ‘foot’ are then proteolytically excised from p88 to generate p31 and p37 VacA fragments ; 3 ) Excision of the linker may enhance mobility of the hydrophobic N - terminus due to their predicted close proximity in the centre of the assembled oligomer ( 8 ) , thereby initiating membrane insertion and formation of the active channel . Notably , the beta - sheet extension of the p55 domain that cradles adjacent protomers is retained in fragment p37 and may be critical to stabilize processed VacA oligomers . The processed and active VacA oligomer dissipates the established ion concentration gradient between endosomes and cytoplasm culminating in vacuolation . Additional proteases present in late endosomes / endo - lysosomes cleave the hydrophobic N - terminus of p31 to generate p28 , which likely also possesses channel activity . The N - terminal and C - terminal structural domains of VacA are shown in cyan and blue , respectively . 28 Supplementary Information for Helicobacter pylori vacuolating cytotoxin A exploits human endosomes for intracellular activation Samuel L Palframan 1 , 2 , Md .

VacA antisera are reactive with recombinant p33 and p55 , native secreted VacA and novel intracellular cleavage products . a , Recombinant purified p33 ( r - p33 ) and p55 ( r - p55 ) proteins , b , H . pylori CS from VacA + Hp ( VacA + ) , VacA – Hp ( VacA – ) , P12 or HI broth , and c , AGS whole - cell lysates post - 24 h treatment with the indicated CS or HI broth were subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti - p33 or anti - p55 as indicated . 30 Figure S2 . VacA fragments are generated inside host cells . a , Immunoblot analysis of AGS cells treated with VacA + or VacA – for 24 h before analysis of AGS spent culture medium ( SM ) and whole cell lysate ( WC ) using anti - p55 . No p37 was detected in SM suggesting that VacA fragments do not arise extracellularly . Immunoblot analysis using b , anti - p33 or c , anti - p55 of VacA + - treated ( 6 h ) AGS cells without ( DMSO ) or with endocytosis inhibitor ( 20 µM cytochalasin D or 20 µM EGA ) . Cells were harvested without ( - ) or with ( + ) trypsin to cleave extracellular VacA p88 into p33 and p55 as a means to distinguish between extracellular and intracellular p88 . The susceptibility of p88 to trypsin confirms that VacA internalization was blocked by these inhibitors , and the absence of processed VacA fragments p31 , p28 and p37 in cells treated with cytochalasin D or EGA further suggests that VacA is processed intracellularly . 31 Figure S3 . Endo - lysosomal fusion , but not autophagy or the proteasome , is involved in intracellular VacA processing . a , Immunoblot analysis of AGS cells pre - treated with various concentrations of MG132 as indicated for 1 h before incubation with VacA + for 6 h ; blot probed using anti - p55 . Processing of VacA p88 into p37 was unaffected by MG132 at all concentrations tested suggesting that proteasomal degradation is not involved in VacA processing . b , Immunoblot analysis of HeLa parental cells , Hexa KO and Vps39 KO cells incubated with VacA + or VacA – for 16 hours using anti - p55 . Processing of VacA p88 was unaffected in Hexa KO cells suggesting that autophagy is not involved in VacA processing . However , in cells lacking Vps39 , a key gene involved in late endosomal and lysosomal clustering and fusion , VacA processing was affected as shown by the presence of an intermediate band at ~ 45 kDa , doublet bands of ~ 38 / 39 kDa and lower overall p37 levels . These data suggest that endosomal maturation is important for complete cleavage of VacA . 32 Figure S4 . VacA is processed by and induces vacuolation in human 2D primary gastric organoids . a , Immunoblot analysis of VacA – and VacA + - treated human 2D primary gastric organoid monolayers using anti - p55 ; VacA p88 is processed by human 2D primary gastric organoids into smaller fragments ( fragments p52 and p48 likely represent intermediate products ) .

Generation and accumulation of VacA fragments in gastric epithelial cells correlates with vacuolation – accumulation experiments . Immunoblot analysis using anti - p33 or anti - p55 ( as indicated ) of AGS cells treated with VacA + for various times before harvest a , without trypsin - shaving or b , with trypsin - shaving ( T + ) . c , Neutral red uptake ( NRU ) assay of AGS cells treated with VacA + or VacA – for various times ; y - axis denotes culture supernatant - treated cells O .

Generation and accumulation of VacA fragments coincides with and is directly proportional to the development of vacuolation , whereas p88 is vulnerable to trypsin at all time points as shown by the presence of p33 and p55 products in cells harvested with trypsin . These data suggest that p88 accumulates on the plasma membrane , is processed into fragments upon internalization and that these fragments represent the intracellular functional form of VacA . 34 Figure S6 . Initiation and resolution of vacuolation correlates with VacA fragment levels in gastric epithelial cells – pulse - chase experiments . a , NRU assay of AGS cells pulsed with VacA + or VacA – for 30 min at staggered time - points and chased ( after washing ) with fresh media for various times from 0 to 24 h post - pulse before synchronized NRU assay . Vacuolation was potentiated by supplementing media with 5 mM NH 4 Cl 30 min prior to NRU assay . Significant vacuolation was evident from 4 h to 16 h post - chase with VacA + , but not with VacA – at any time - point . By 20 h post - chase , NH 4 Cl was no longer able to significantly potentiate vacuolation in response to VacA + intoxication . y - axis denotes CS - treated cells O .

Spearman correlation analysis was performed using median NRU data and individual densitometry data - points , all from 3 independent experiments and 0 – 10 h post - chase . 35 Figure S7 . p31 , p28 and p37 are constituents of higher - order complexes in mitochondria - enriched AGS fractions . Independent repeat of experiment shown in Fig . 4a : 2D - PAGE and subsequent immunoblot analysis of mitochondria - enriched fractions isolated from AGS cells treated with VacA + for 24 h using the indicated antibodies . Processed products p31 , p28 and p37 are constituents of the same higher - order VacA complex that may represent functional VacA anion channels ; F 1 β is the beta subunit of F 1 - ATPase complex and serves as a BN - PAGE control . 36 Figure S8 . Identification of novel VacA cleavage products and difference between p31 and p28 . a , VacA coverage map of tryptic / chymotryptic peptides identified following common bottom - up MS analyses of p88 , p31 , p28 or p37 in - gel bands . The origins of these fragments were further confirmed by epitope - tagging the predicted p31 and p37 regions of VacA , which conferred anti - Strep reactivity to either the anti - p33 or anti - p55 reactive bands ( SI Appendix , Fig . S10 ) . Immunoblot analysis of AGS cells infected with various H . pylori 60190 - derived strains for 24 h using b , anti - p33 or c , anti - p55 ; VacA + ( 2 ) designates alternative 60190wt strain , Str 312 contains a Strep - tag within the hydrophilic linker at aa position 312 and ∆6 - 27 lacks aa residues 6 - 27 . Similar to VacA + , p88 from strains VacA + ( 2 ) and Str312 were processed into fragments p31 , p28 and p37 as expected ( panels b , c ) . Interestingly , the presence of a smaller product in place of p31 in strain ∆6 - 27 ( panel b ) , which lacks the hydrophobic N - terminal alpha helix , suggests that the difference between fragments p31 and p28 corresponds to the presence and absence , respectively , of this region . 37 Figure S9 . NH 4 Cl reduces VacA processing . Immunoblot analysis of VacA + pulse - chase time - course in AGS cells without ( - ) or with ( + ) 5mM NH 4 Cl during different stages of the pulse - chase : pre ( 1 h pre - treatment ) , pulse ( 0 . 5 h co - pulse with VacA + ) or chase ( 6 h ) . Samples were harvested at 0 , 1 or 6 h post - pulse as indicated . In the absence of NH 4 Cl p88 was processed into p37 as soon as 1 h into the chase and accumulated over time . Conversely , almost no p88 remained after 6 h . When NH 4 Cl was added during the chase alone or during the pulse and chase stages , less processing of p88 occurred resulting in lower p37 levels and higher p88 levels after 6 h . Interestingly , under these conditions an intermediate product of ~ 50 kDa was detected after 6 hours suggesting that VacA likely undergoes sequential processing . When cells were treated with NH 4 Cl during the pre - treatment , pulse and chase stages , processing of p88 into p37 was completely inhibited and p88 levels remained high throughout the chase . Again , an intermediate ~ 50 kDa product was detected after 6 h , which suggests that NH 4 Cl does not completely inhibit VacA processing . These data show that NH 4 Cl inhibits host cell VacA processing to varying degrees depending on when the drug is added and also demonstrates that VacA processing occurs in a sequential , step - wise manner . 38 Figure S10 . Insertion of Strep - tag into p31 / p28 or p37 VacA regions further confirms their VacA origin . a , Strep - tags were inserted into 60190 VacA at aa positions 234 ( Str 234 ) or 525 ( Str 525 ) to further confirm the VacA origin of p31 / p28 and p37 fragments , respectively ; arrow indicates position of Strep - tag . Immunoblot analysis of AGS cells treated for 24 h with VacA – , VacA + , Str 234 or Str 525 CS using b , anti - Strep c , anti - p33 or d , anti - p55 . VacA p31 and p28 products were detected using anti - Strep following treatment of host cells with Str 234 , while p37 was detected using anti - Strep following treatment of host cells with Str 525 ( panel b ) . Furthermore , treating cells with Str 234 resulted in slightly larger p31 and p28 fragments compared to corresponding VacA + fragments when probed with anti - p33 ( panel c ) , while cells treated with Str 525 resulted in a larger p37 fragment when probed with anti - p55 ( panel d ) . Together these data demonstrate the successful insertion of Strep - tags into p31 , p28 and p37 fragments , further confirming their VacA origin . 39 Table S1 .
