Introduction Thereisnowincreasingconsensusintheacademicliter - ature that a ﬁrm’s embeddedness in a network of interﬁrm relations matters for its economic and innovative perfor - mance ( Nooteboom , 1992 ; Hagedoorn , 1993 ; Powell et al . , 1996 ; Rowley et al . , 2000 ; Ahuja , 2000a ; Owen - Smith and Powell , 2004 ) . The empirical evidence has indicated that this relationship between embeddedness and innovation can be found in industries as diverse as chemicals ( Ahuja , ∗ Corresponding author at : Eindhoven Centre for Innovation Studies ( ECIS ) , Eindhoven University of Technology , P .

Gilsing ) . 2000a ) , biotechnology ( Baum et al . , 2000 ; Powell et al . , 1996 ) , semiconductors ( Stuart , 1998 ) , textiles ( Uzzi , 1997 ) , personal computers ( Hagedoorn and Duysters , 2002 ) and banking ( Zaheer and Bell , 2005 ) . More recently , some stud - ies have started to unravel this notion of embeddedness in order to understand in what speciﬁc ways it contributes to a ﬁrm’s innovation performance . Here , characteristics of partners have been studied such as their degree of innovativeness ( Stuart , 1998 ) as well as the properties of alliances such as the role of formal governance mecha - nisms ( Mowery et al . , 1996 ) , equity vs . non - equity alliances ( Rowleyetal . , 2000 ) ortheroleofrepeatedcontacts ( Wuyts et al . , 2005 ) . Beyond the dyad level , studies at the network level have shown that the properties of an alliance net - work also affect innovation . Here it has been shown that apart from the number of direct ties ( Ahuja , 2000a ; Shan 0048 - 7333 / $ – see front matter © 2008 Published by Elsevier B . V . doi : 10 . 1016 / j . respol . 2008 . 08 . 010 1718 V . Gilsing et al . / Research Policy 37 ( 2008 ) 1717 – 1731 et al . , 1994 ) also a ﬁrm’s indirect ties ( Ahuja , 2000b ) and the redundancy among these ties ( Ahuja , 2000b ; Baum et al . , 2000 ; McEvily and Zaheer , 1999 ) affect its innovation performance . In most of these studies an important function of alliances is that they function as ‘pipelines’ through which information and knowledge ﬂows between ﬁrms ( Owen - Smith and Powell , 2004 ) . This focus on the diffusion potential of alliances may not be surprising as most studies on the role of embeddedness have been assum - ing conditions of relative environmental stability . Here , embeddedness refers to routinisation and stabilization of linkages among members as a result of a history of exchanges and relations within a group or community ( Gulati , 1998 ) . Undersuchstructure - reinforcingconditions , the role of embeddedness is increasingly well under - stood ( Gulati , 1998 ; Madhavan et al . , 1998 ; Koka et al . , 2006 ) . These conditions connect with March’s category of exploitation ( 1991 ) in which environmental uncertainty is rather limited and the focus is on the reﬁnement and extension of existing competences and technologies . The rationale for teaming up with partners then is formed by possibilities to obtain complementary know - how ( Teece , 1986 ) and / or to speed up the R & D process in indus - tries where time - to - market is crucial . Here , cooperation is attractive as partners have a good understanding of the rel - evantissuesathandandalliancesenablearapiddiffusionof knowledge among partners , enhancing the efﬁciency and speed of cooperation ( Gilsing , 2005 ) . In this strand of literature , an implicit underlying assumption is that similarity of partners is beneﬁcial for learning and innovation . This follows from Cohen and Levinthal’s ( 1990 ) inﬂuential notion of absorptive capac - ity , where the idea that the extent to which ﬁrms can learn from external knowledge may be largely dependent upon the similarity of the partners’ knowledge bases . In a similar vein , different studies have demonstrated that learning potential declines with an increase in dissimilar - ity of knowledge stocks ( Hamel , 1991 ; Lane and Lubatkin , 1998 ; Mowery et al . , 1996 ; Fleming and Sorenson , 2001 ) . So , forinter - organisationallearninginexploitation , similar - ity is attractive and distances in knowledge and cognition ( cognitive distance ) constitute a liability . This raises the question of how to understand the role of network embeddedness in view of exploration that can be characterized by breaking away from the estab - lished way of doing things , with a focus on the discovery and experimentation of new technologies ( March , 1991 ; Nooteboom , 2000 ) . By its very nature , exploration is not about efﬁciency of current activities , but rather forms an uncertain process that deals with the search for new , technology - based business opportunities ( Rowley et al . , 2000 ; Nooteboom , 2000 ) , requiring the production of new insights and knowledge . This points to a different role of a ﬁrm’s alliance network , namely its recombination poten - tial for new knowledge creation rather than its function as a channelfordiffusionof existing informationandknowledge for exploitation . Existing literature has largely ignored this role of alliances for novelty creation and is therefore unable to explain the development of new knowledge and compe - tencies ( Hagedoorn et al . , 2000 ; Phelps , 2005 ) . In contrast to exploitation , in this process of exploration partner sim - ilarity is unattractive whereas cognitive distance between partners forms an important asset . The main aim of this paper is to develop an under - standing of the role of a ﬁrm’s alliance network in view of exploration . To do so , we will ﬁrst consider this role of cognitive distance between ﬁrms in order to understand how far dissimilarity between partners is attractive in view of exploration . Second , we combine such a cognitive view with a social structural one . In this way we complement the literature that has predominantly focused on the role of economic and social factors regarding alliance forma - tion and the role of network embeddedness ( Gulati , 1998 ) . A cognition - based understanding of these processes , how - ever , is still in its infancy ( Moran , 2005 ) . Combiningtheroleofcognitiveandsocialstructuralfac - torsmayprovideuswithnewinsightsintowhatconstitutes an optimal network structure for exploration . As we will argue , for exploration ﬁrms are faced with a dual task . On theonehand , theyneedtodevelopaccesstoheterogeneous sources of knowledge and in this way create a potential for novel combinations . This requires an emphasis on diver - sity and disintegrated network structures , which is related toBurt’sargument ( 1992 ) stressingthebeneﬁtsofaccessto non - redundant contacts to obtain novel information ( nov - elty value ) . On the other hand , ﬁrms need to make sure that such novel knowledge , once accessed , is evaluated , and when proven to be valuable is adequately absorbed . This process favours more homogeneous network structures in view of integrating the diverse inputs obtained from distant part - ners ( Hansen , 1999 ) . This is more in line with Coleman’s view ( 1988 ) stressing the beneﬁts of redundant network structures . Given these differences between the two tasks , we claim that a ﬁrm’s network will impact differently on eachtask . So , animportantcontributionofthispaperisthat it investigates how far optimal embeddedness for novelty creationmayformaburdenforabsorptivecapacityandvice versa . In this way , we may shed new light on the ongoing debate on the validity of the arguments by Burt , favour - ing structural holes , versus those of Coleman , favouring closure . This paper is structured as follows . In Section 2 we elab - orate our theoretical argument and formulate a number of hypotheses . Then , in Section 3 , we present details about the data , the speciﬁcation of variables , and the estimation method . In Section 4 we present our main ﬁndings . Finally , inSection5 , weprovideadiscussionoftheresults , themain conclusions and some indications for further research . 2 . Theory and hypotheses As argued above , the central focus of this paper is on the role of a ﬁrm’s alliance network regarding the ‘twin tasks’ of on the one hand creating novel combinations , and on the other hand the build - up of absorptive capacity for under - standing such novel combinations . To understand its role , we study a ﬁrm’s alliance network along three dimensions . First , following Nooteboom et al . ( 2005 ) , we consider the role of cognitive distance among the ﬁrms making up such an alliance network . Here , cognitive distance refers to the V . Gilsing et al . / Research Policy 37 ( 2008 ) 1717 – 1731 1719 extent that ﬁrms differ in their technological knowledge and expertise . Next we focus on the role of a ﬁrm’s posi - tion in a network . As a third element of a ﬁrm’s alliance network we study the role of network density . By consid - ering cognitive distance as well as position and network density we combine a cognitive view of a ﬁrm’s alliance network with a social structural view . Whereas a cogni - tive view elucidates the potential for recombination due to distances in cognition between ﬁrms , a social structural view highlights how technology - based alliances serve as the mechanism for crossing such distances and accessing ( proximate and distant ) partners . In this way , combining the two perspectives provides a complementary theoreti - calfoundationforunderstandingtheroleofaﬁrm’salliance network in exploration . 2 . 1 . Exploration The distinction between exploration and exploitation goes back to Holland ( 1975 ) and was later further devel - oped by March ( 1991 ) . Exploitation can be characterized as a process of routinisation , which adds to the exist - ing knowledge base and competence set of ﬁrms without changingthenatureofactivities ( March , 1991 ) . Thisresem - bles ‘local search’ in which ﬁrms search for new knowledge thatislesslikelytoconﬂictwiththeirexistingcognitiveand mental models ( Nelson and Winter , 1982 ) . 1 They develop moreandmorecompetenceintheirparticularﬁeld , further increasing the chance of immediate and positive returns . Exploitation may therefore increase a ﬁrm’s innovative performance due to returns from specialization , however it may also lead to technological obsolescence and leave ﬁrms locked out from new developments ( March , 1991 ; Sorensen and Stuart , 2000 ) . To escape from this lock - in sit - uation , ﬁrms need to engage in so - called exploration that canbecharacterizedbybreakingwithanexistingdominant design and shifting away from existing rules , norms , rou - tines and activities , in search of novel combinations . Hence exploration is not about efﬁciency of current activities and cannot be planned for . It is an uncertain process that is characterized by a constant search for new opportunities . 2 Although the literature agrees on the fact that alliance networks form an important instrument in this process ( Powell et al . , 1996 ; Rowley et al . , 2000 ) , there is very lim - ited empirical evidence of how they facilitate the creation of new knowledge in this process of exploration . An important issue here is that we take a ﬁrm’s per - spective on exploration . In other words , in this paper we will focus on the creation of technological knowl - edge that is new to the ﬁrm . So , we consider knowledge as novel and the activities to create such knowledge as exploratory if they fall outside a ﬁrm’s existing knowledge stock , even though they may have been in existence ear - 1 Underlying this is the idea of the relative inertia of ﬁrms , as advanced bypopulationecologythatﬁrmsarebetteratdoingmoreofthesamethan at adapting to change ( Carroll and Hannan , 2000 ) . 2 Exploration and exploitation are related and build on each other : exploration develops into exploitation , and exploration emerges from exploitation , in ways that go beyond the present paper ( see for a further discussion Nooteboom , 2000 ; Gilsing and Nooteboom , 2006 ) . Fig . 1 . Novelty and absorptive capacity . lier elsewhere . This clearly differs from exploration that yields knowledge that is new to the industry or perhaps even new to the world . These latter two form ‘newly emerging’ and respectively ‘pioneering’ technologies , rep - resenting ( much ) more radical types of exploration ( Ahuja and Lampert , 2001 ) . 2 . 2 . Role of technological distance Regarding the role of cognitive distance , Nooteboom ( 1999 ) proposed a model , which was tested by Wuyts et al . ( 2005 ) and by Nooteboom et al . ( 2005 ) . The key argument inthemodelisthatwhilelargerdistancesincognitionhave anegativeeffectonabsorptivecapacity , theyhaveapositive effect on the potential for novelty creation . In ﬁrst instance , as cognitive distance increases , it has a positive effect on learning by interaction because it yields opportunities for novelcombinationsofcomplementaryresources . However , at a certain point cognitive distance becomes so large as to preclude sufﬁcient mutual understanding needed to utilize those opportunities ( see also Fig . 1 ) . Of course , a certain degree of mutual understanding is needed for collaboration , and familiarity certainly breeds trust ( Gulati , 1995a ) , which facilitates successful collabo - ration . However , too much familiarity may take out the innovative steam from collaboration . The challenge then is to ﬁnd partners at sufﬁcient cognitive distance to learn something new , but not so distant as to preclude mutual understanding . In general , cognitive distance entails more than just technological distance , although there is correlation between technological distance and distance in other functional disciplines such as marketing , production and engineering . In this paper , we specify cognitive distance in terms of technological distance , for two empirical reasons . First , our measure of innovative success will be based on patents , and there technological knowledge is more dom - inant . A second , more pragmatic argument is that it is not clear precisely how other dimensions of cognitive distance should be measured ( cf . Wuyts et al . , 2005 ) . 1720 V . Gilsing et al . / Research Policy 37 ( 2008 ) 1717 – 1731 The logic of the above argument can be reframed in terms of technological distance : absorptive capacity declines with technological distance , and novelty value increases with it . For both effects of technological distance the simplest effect would be linear , and this is hypothe - sized until theoretical or empirical arguments emerge for a more complicated effect . Seen in this way , innovative per - formancebycollaborationishypothesizedtoarisefromthe interaction ( modelledasthemathematicalproduct ) ofnov - elty value and absorptive capacity . The basic idea here is that there is an inverted - U shaped relationship . Mathemat - ically : AC = a 0 − a 1 · TD ( a 0 , a 1 > 0 ) , ( 1 ) and NV = b 0 + b 1 · TD ( b 0 , b 1 > 0 ) . ( 2 ) where AC is the absorptive capacity , NV is the novelty value and TD is the technological distance . Theinnovationperformanceofcollaborationinthedyad ( = IP ) is deﬁned as the product of the two linear effects : IP = AC · NV ( 3 ) Replacing AC and NV by the right - hand side of Eqs . ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) yields : IP = a 0 · b 0 + ( a 0 · b 1 − b 0 · a 1 ) TD − a 1 · b 1 · TD 2 ( 4 ) Eq . ( 4 ) results in an inverse U - shaped effect if and only if : a 0 · b 1 > b 0 · a 1 ( 5 ) In sum , this leads to our ﬁrst hypothesis as follows . Hypothesis 1 . Exploration is an inverse U - shaped func - tion of technological distance . 2 . 3 . Role of network position Next to technological distance along any tie between two actors , another complementary dimension of vari - ety is the number and pattern of ties in a network . Our purpose now is to add such network effects to the effect of technological distance . In other words , we com - bine effects from relational embeddedness ( technological distance ) and structural embeddedness ( network effects ) ( Granovetter , 1985 ; Rowley et al . , 2000 ) . Unlike the local search process of exploitation ( March , 1991 ) , the search process in exploration is ‘recombinant’ , reﬂecting the idea that novelty arises as the result of ( re ) combining and transforming existing and novel ele - ments of knowledge into something radically new ( Nelson and Winter , 1982 ; Henderson and Clark , 1990 ; Tushman and Rosenkopf , 1992 ; Ahuja and Lampert , 2001 ) . Here , the role of an alliance network is that it brings together a vari - ety of skills and experience , which provides a potential for the generation of Schumpeterian novel combinations ( Schumpeter , 1939 ) . In this case , alliances do not serve as channels for the diffusion of existing knowledge and com - petencies but rather generate a recombination potential in view of new knowledge creation . This recombination potential originates from the fact that knowledge , values and behaviour are more homogeneous within groups than between groups , so that ﬁrms connected across groups have more access to alternative ways of thinking , giving them more options for creating new combinations ( Burt , 2004 ) . 3 To effectuate this recombination potential of its alliance network , ﬁrms should develop ties to companies thatarethemselvesnotconnectedtoaﬁrm’sexistinggroup of partners . A tie will provide access to new informa - tion and entrepreneurial opportunities to the extent that it offers access to non - redundant sources of information ( Burt , 1992 ) . Such a tie spans a structural hole . Structural holes guarantee that the partnering companies on both sides of the hole have access to different ﬂows of informa - tion ( Hargadon and Sutton , 1997 ) and that the information that comes from these mutually unconnected allies is non - redundant . Note that here we are looking at whether or not ties exist , across structural holes , apart from the tech - nological distance involved in any tie . A key issue here is that possibilities to create such non - redundant ties are not equally spread across ﬁrms . A ﬁrm’s network position importantly conditions the possibility to create alliances to such non - redundant partners and beneﬁt from these accordingly . Central ﬁrms become better informed about what is going on in the network . This increases possi - bilities for central ﬁrms to initiate the formation of new alliances ( Gnyawali and Madhavan , 2001 ) . Moreover , this combination of timely access to important and novel infor - mation and their higher status and power increases their bargaining power ( Gnyawali and Madhavan , 2001 ; Burt , 2004 ) , which also improves possibilities to beneﬁt more from their alliances than less central ﬁrms . Following this , we expect that central ﬁrms form attractive partners to ally with , whichenhancesthelikelihoodthatthesecentralplay - ers , when engaging in exploration , will create alliances to non - redundant partners and beneﬁt from these alliances accordingly . Asaconsequence , weanticipatethatcentrality has a positive effect on the search for novel combina - tions and hence on exploration , in particular on novelty value . However , searching through non - redundant ties comes at a price and bears certain risks . A consequence of hav - ing access to many non - redundant ties is that central ﬁrms have to deal with a higher volume of more diverse infor - mation that will arrive at faster rates when compared with less central ﬁrms ( Gnyawali and Madhavan , 2001 ) . This consumes time and resources that cannot be allocated for absorbing and integrating the obtained novel insights . Second , a sole focus on searching for novelty through non - redundant ties may result in a random drift so that a ﬁrm’s knowledge base changes continuously in different and unrelateddirections , makingtheaccessednovelknowledge difﬁcult to absorb and integrate ( Fleming and Sorenson , 2001 ; Ahuja and Katila , 2004 ) . So , both from a search - costs and a cognition point of view , too many non - redundant ties will decrease the potential for novelty absorption . In other words , centrality spurs the possibilities for novelty creation but at high ( er ) levels it may impede the possibili - ties for absorption of this novelty . Note that apart from the 3 “People who stand near the holes in a social structure are at a higher risk of having good ideas” ( Burt , 2004 : 349 ) . V . Gilsing et al . / Research Policy 37 ( 2008 ) 1717 – 1731 1721 number of non - redundant ties one has , there is the issue of technological distance along each tie . Thus , we hypothesize that , next to effects of technologi - caldistance , centralityhasapositiveeffectonnoveltyvalue ( NV ) and a negative effect on absorptive capacity ( AC ) , and bythesamelogicasfortheeffectsoftechnologicaldistance , with innovative performance being a product of NV and AC ) , this yields an inverse U - shaped effect on exploration . Hypothesis 2 . Exploration is an inverse - U shaped func - tion of network centrality . 2 . 4 . Role of network density In contrast to the effects of centrality , we anticipate that network density limits the potential for novelty creation whereas it enhances the build - up of absorptive capacity . As we will argue , both direct and indirect ties play a role in building up absorptive capacity . Therefore we consider the role of ‘global network density’ , which considers both types of ties as a property of the total network , rather than the density of ties surrounding a speciﬁc node . As we will argue , both direct and indirect ties play a role in building up absorptive capacity . Novel knowledge from a direct partner , especially at a large technological distance , may not be readily under - standable for a ﬁrm . If one is not able to understand novel information from a given source adequately , one may need another partner to complement one’s absorptive capacity ( Gilsing and Nooteboom , 2005 ) . In other words , the extent to which one’s partners are linked may help in dealing with technological distance to any of them . More precisely , if A remains linked to both B and C , even if there is also a link between B and C , this may help A to understand C by com - paringwhatAunderstandsfromCwithwhatBunderstands from C . This can matter especially when there is a large technological distance between A and C . In other words , even if a ﬁrm’s direct ties are known to be redundant for access to sources of information , they may be needed both to understand and to absorb knowledge accessed in the other relation . This is the case particularly when engaging in explo - ration , where new and distant knowledge is accessed , and dominant designs and standards may be lacking . Moreover , the often tacit and experimental nature of exploration fur - ther increases the difﬁculty of ﬁrms to recognize and value thetechnologyofpotentialpartnerswhentheyarenotcon - nected through a common alliance partner . In this way , not only direct but also indirect ties can enhance the absorp - tive capacity of the ﬁrm by acting as device for screening and interpreting novel information on its potential rele - vance and value ( Leonard - Barton , 1984 ; Vanhaverbeke et al . , 2008 ) . In addition , even if one does understand a given source , one may not be able to judge the reliability of infor - mation , so that , like researchers in gathering potentially biaseddata , onemayneedathirdpartyasasourcefortrian - gulation ( Gilsing and Nooteboom , 2005 ) . In this way , ﬁrms may be able to develop a richer understanding and a better evaluation of the acquired novelty ( Rowley et al . , 2000 ) . In addition , a dense network of direct and indirect ties also facilitates the build - up of trust , a reputation mech - anism , and coalitions to constrain opportunism ( Gulati , 1995a , b ; Hagedoorn and Duysters , 2002 ) . These are the prime arguments for closure , introduced by Coleman ( 1988 ) . They apply especially to exploration in view of the uncertainty surrounding it , which limits options for gover - nance by formal contracts ( Nooteboom , 1999 , 2002 ) . Now , density and its potential for trust building enables a proliferation of triangulation , as follows . First , it is useful for neighbours of the focal ﬁrm to be mutually connected for triangulation . Next , information from any neighbour is richer and more reliable to the extent that the neighbour also proﬁts from triangulation among its neighbours . So , density through direct ties and indirect ties plays an important role with regard to assessing the reliability of ( technologically distant ) sources of novelty as well as understanding and evaluating these sources . In sum , we propose that density enhances the absorptive capacity of each individual ﬁrm in the network . Let us now turn to the arguments against dense net - works . Oneargumententailsthattherearecostsassociated with establishing and maintaining contacts and that by sheddingredundantties , ﬁrmscancreateefﬁciencyintheir network ( Burt , 1992 ) . However , in exploration such costs of redundancy play a limited role as the key focus here is on ﬁnding and absorbing novelty , making considerations of efﬁciency less of an issue ( Hagedoorn and Duysters , 2002 ; Gilsing and Nooteboom , 2005 ) . The main argument against high density , however , is that it inhibits the existence and the utilization of diver - sity , and hence of novelty value . When knowledge is more densely spread across ﬁrms in the network , the beneﬁts of direct ties and indirect ties in giving access to novelty will decline , because ‘everyone knows what everyone knows’ . Firms are less likely to gain new or additional informa - tion from their indirect ties , as the information that can be obtained from them will be very similar to the knowledge alreadyobtainedfromitsdirectcontacts . Asaconsequence , thepotentialforcreatingnovelcombinationswilldiminish . A dense network also increases the likelihood that knowledgeandinformationreachingthecompanythrough its alliance network also reaches its partners . This may cre - ateariskofundesirablespillovers . Suchdiffusionofnovelty throughout the network can put limits on its appropria - tion and make it less attractive for ﬁrms to search for such novelty ( Gilsing and Nooteboom , 2005 ) . A ﬁnal argument against density is , as indicated before , that it facilitates effective sanctions . As pointed out by Coleman ( 1988 ) , dense networks enable reputation effects , and yield opportunities for coalitions to constrain behaviour . This is useful for the governance of relational risk , but may create strong behavioural pressures to con - form rather than to be radically different ( Kraatz , 1998 ) . Firms may also be pre - empted from entering into new , more innovative relationships , as the implicit expectation ofloyaltytotheirexistingpartnersandnetworkmayinhibit them from allying with others ( Buchko , 1994 ; Nooteboom , 1999 ; Duysters and Lemmens , 2003 ; Gulati et al . , 2000 ) . In sum , density supports the build - up of shared absorp - tive capacity but it may impede the possibilities for search andnoveltycreation . Theseargumentsleadtothefollowing hypothesis . 1722 V . Gilsing et al . / Research Policy 37 ( 2008 ) 1717 – 1731 Hypothesis 3 . Exploration is an inverse - U shaped func - tion of density . 2 . 5 . Combined effects The effects of technological distance ( TD ) ( Hypothesis 1 ) , betweennesscentrality ( BC ) ( Hypothesis2 ) andnetwork density ( D ) ( Hypothesis3 ) applysimultaneously , andhence there are interaction effects between them . Theoretically , theinverseU - shapedeffectsresultfromoppositeeffectson absorptive capacity ( AC ) and novelty value ( NV ) , which are multiplied in their effects on exploration performance , as speciﬁed previously for the effect of technological distance . In Hypothesis 1 we posited that technological distance has a negative effect on absorptive capacity and a positive effectonnoveltyvalue . InHypothesis2wearguedthatcen - trality has a negative effect on absorptive capacity and a positive effect on novelty value . In Hypothesis 3 we assume that network density has a positive effect on absorptive capacity and a negative effect on novelty value . For the combined effects , the full model then becomes : AC = a 0 − a 1 · TD − a 2 · BC + a 3 · D ( 6 ) NV = b 0 + b 1 · TD + b 2 · BC − b 3 · D , a 0 , a 1 , a 2 , a 3 , b 0 , b 1 , b 2 , b 3 > 0 ( 7 ) Multiplying ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) provides the equation for explo - ration performance ( IP ) : IP = AC · NV = ( a 0 · b 1 − b 0 · a 1 ) · TD + ( a 0 · b 2 − b 0 · a 2 ) · BC + ( b 0 · a 3 − a 0 · b 3 ) · D − a 1 · b 1 · TD 2 − a 2 · b 2 · BC 2 − a 3 · b 3 · D 2 − ( a 1 · b 2 + a 2 · b 1 ) · TD · BC + ( a 1 · b 3 + a 3 · b 1 ) · TD · D + ( a 2 · b 3 + a 3 · b 2 ) · BC · D ( 8 ) where a 0 · b 1 > b 0 · a 1 , a 0 · b 2 > b 0 · a 2 and b 0 · a 3 > a 0 · b 3 This mathematical model can be interpreted in the fol - lowing way . The interaction effect of two variables on exploration is negative when they have an effect in the same direction on novelty value or on absorptive capac - ity . These yield alternative ways for achieving those effects and here the variables can be considered as substitutes . This applies to the interaction effect between technological distance and betweenness centrality , which both enhance novelty value while decreasing absorptive capacity . Thus , such a combined increase in the potential for novelty value with a decrease of the ability to absorb this novelty has a negative net effect on exploration . Interaction effects are positive when variables have opposite effects on nov - elty value and on absorptive capacity . Here , the interacting effects form complements . An increase in novelty value is accompanied by an increase in the ability to absorb it . This applies to the interaction effects between technologi - cal distance and density as well as to the interaction effect between betweenness centrality and density . In both cases , an increase in novelty value , due to an increase of techno - logical distance or an increase of centrality , is accompanied by an increase in absorptive capacity due to an increase of network density . In other words , there are alternative strategies for the maximization of exploration . High ( low ) technologi - cal distance would need to be compensated by low ( high ) betweenness centrality and / or high ( low ) density . High ( low ) betweenness centrality would have to be compen - sated by low ( high ) technological distance and / or high ( low ) density . High ( low ) density would have to be com - pensated by high ( low ) technological distance and / or high ( low ) betweenness centrality . In sum , this leads to our ﬁnal three hypotheses as fol - lows . Hypothesis 4 . The interaction between technological dis - tance and betweenness centrality has a negative effect on exploration . Hypothesis 5 . The interaction between technological dis - tance and density has a positive effect on exploration . Hypothesis6 . Theinteractionbetweenbetweennesscen - trality and density has a positive effect on exploration . 3 . Data and methods 3 . 1 . Data The sample set for this study consisted of panel data on the alliance and patenting activities of 116 companies in the chemicals , automotive and pharmaceutical indus - tries . The reason for choosing these three industries is that they share the importance of investing in R & D and innovation , but that they also reveal profound differences regarding some key characteristics such as the stage of industry development ( Walker et al . , 1997 ) , the importance of exploration vis - à - vis exploitation ( Rowley et al . , 2000 ) and the importance of product versus process innovations ( Tiddetal . , 1997 ) . Testingourhypothesesindifferentindus - triesenablesustoassesshowfartheroleofaﬁrm’salliance network for exploration and exploitation remains invari - ant across industries , enhancing the generalization of the results . The focal ﬁrms that we study were observed over a 12 - year period , from 1986 until 1997 . The panel is unbalanced because of new start - ups and mergers and acquisitions . The 116 companies were selected to include public com - panies in these three industries that were also establishing technology - based strategic alliances . Information on the establishment of alliances is hard to obtain for small or privately owned companies . Previous studies on interﬁrm alliances also focused on leading companies in an industry ( Ahuja , 2000b ; Gulati , 1995b ) . In total , 994 alliances were established in the period 1986 – 1996 among these companies . Alliance data were retrieved from the MERIT - CATI database , which contains information on nearly 15 thousand cooperative technol - ogy agreements and their ‘parent’ companies , covering the period 1970 – 1996 ( see Hagedoorn and Duysters , 2002 , for a further description ) . Combining ﬁnancial data with the CATI data on strategic alliances further reduced the ﬁnal sample to 85 companies and 762 alliances . V . Gilsing et al . / Research Policy 37 ( 2008 ) 1717 – 1731 1723 Exploration , the dependent variable , is based on patent counts . AllpatentingdatawereretrievedfromtheUSPatent Ofﬁce Database for all the companies in the sample , also those based outside the US . Working with US patents – the largest patent market – is preferable to the use of sev - eral national patent systems “ . . . to maintain consistency , reliability and comparability , as patenting systems across nations differ in the application of standards , system of granting patents , and value of protection granted” ( Ahuja , 2000a , p . 434 ) . Especially in industries where companies operate on an international or global scale US patents may be a good proxy for companies’ worldwide innovative per - formance . For companies in the three sectors the ﬁnancial data were derived from a combination of Worldscope , Compus - tat and data published in the companies’ annual reports . 3 . 2 . Variables 3 . 2 . 1 . Dependent variable The different hypotheses test the effect of technological distance , network position and overall network density on the explorative innovation performance of companies in the chemical , automotive and pharmaceutical industries . To derive the dependent variable , technological proﬁles of all focal companies were computed to ﬁnd out whether newpatentsintheyearofobservationcouldbecategorized as ‘explorative’ . These technological proﬁles were created by adding up the number of patents a ﬁrm received in each patent class during the 5 years prior to the year of observation . Different scholars have argued that a moving window of 5 years is an appropriate timeframe for assess - ing the technological impact of prior inventions ( Podolny and Stuart , 1995 ; Stuart and Podolny , 1996 ; Henderson and Cockburn , 1996 ; Ahuja , 2000a ) . Studies of R & D depre - ciation ( Griliches , 1979 , 1984 ) suggest that knowledge capital depreciates sharply , losing most of its economic value within 5 years . The USPTO classes were determined at two - digit level , which resulted in approximately 400 classes . From these technology proﬁles we can distinguish between exploitative and explorative technology classes . Classes in which a company receives a patent in the year of observation but had not received a patent in the previ - ous 5 years were considered ‘explorative’ patent classes . 4 Since knowledge remains relatively new and unexplored for a ﬁrm immediately after patenting , patent classes kept their explorative ‘status’ for three consecutive years , par - allel to Ahuja and Lampert’s ( 2001 ) concept of novel and emerging technologies . 5 All the classes in which a com - pany had successfully applied for a patent the previous 5 years and successfully applied for a patent in the year of observation were considered ‘exploitative’ patent classes . 4 We chose the year when the company ﬁled for the patent rather than the year when it was granted , because the innovation in the company already has been realized when the company ﬁles for a patent . 5 In order to test the robustness of this measure , we also constructed a ‘exploration patents’ variable where explorative patents could keep this status for 5 years instead of 3 years . 3 . 2 . 2 . Explanatory variables Technological distance , centrality and overall network density are the three explanatory variables that have to be operationalized . The ﬁrst variable is based on USPTO patent count data . The other two are calculated based on the alliances that were established during the 5 - year period prior to the year of observation . This moving win - dowapproachisconsideredtobeanappropriatetimeframe during which the existing alliance portfolio is likely to have an inﬂuence on the current technological performance of a ﬁrm ( Kogut , 1988 , 1989 ; Gulati , 1995b ) . Technological distance : Technological distance was mea - sured on the basis of CRTA , which is the Pearson correlation index of the distribution across technological classes of the revealed technological advantages ( RTA ) of each ﬁrm rel - ative to the other sample ﬁrms . The RTA of a ﬁrm in a particular technological ﬁeld is given by the ﬁrm’s share in that ﬁeld of the US patents granted to all companies in the study , relative to its overall share of all US patents granted to these companies . The RTA index varies around one , such that a value higher than one suggests that a ﬁrm is comparatively specialized in the technology in question , given its overall innovative performance . Positive values of CRTA indicate similarity of the pattern of relative tech - nological specialization of ﬁrms , as it appears from the distribution of their patent activity across technological ﬁelds . Foreachﬁrmandeachyear , aproﬁlewasconstructed ofitsrevealedtechnologicaladvantage ( RTA ) ineachpatent class . A company’s RTA index in a patent class is deﬁned as its share of patents in that class ( compared to all its alliance partners ) divided by its share in all patent classes . The correlation coefﬁcient was computed pairwise between the RTA proﬁle of the focal ﬁrm and that of each of its alliance partners . The CRTA variable is then calculated as the average of these correlations . The values for CRTA can theoreticallyvaryfrom − 1to1 . Aspositive ( negative ) values indicate smaller ( larger ) technological distances , we chose to transform this variable into a new one ( ‘Technological distance’ ) withaminimumvalueofzeroandamaximumof hundred , where higher values indicate larger technological distance . The values for this variable in Table 2 indicate that the average technological distance is 42 . 4 with a standard deviation of 7 . 1 . The maximum distance is 52 . 5 and the minimum 4 . 8 . Overall network density : This explanatory variable is a characteristic of the overall alliance network in a partic - ular year for one of the three industries . This variable is “calculated as the number of all ties occurring in the matrix divided by the number of all possible ties” ( Knoke and Kuklinski , 1982 ) . Table 2 shows that the networks are sparse . The networks are calculated for each year and each industry : the density ranges from 0 . 5 % to 2 . 9 % . The average is 1 . 3 % . Network centrality : The second variable related to a ﬁrm’s alliance network is its betweenness centrality . Betweenness centrality measures the centrality of a focal ﬁrm in a network , and is calculated as the fraction of short - est paths between other companies that pass through the focal ﬁrm . Betweenness is , in some sense , a measure of the 1724 V . Gilsing et al . / Research Policy 37 ( 2008 ) 1717 – 1731 Table 1 Deﬁnitions of dependent and independent variables Variable name Variable description Dependent variable Explorative patents Number of patents a ﬁrm successfully ﬁled for in year t within patent classes in which it has not been active in the 5 years prior to the given year . The status of explorative patent’ is kept for 3 years Independent variables Technological distance The average of the correlations between the focal ﬁrm’s technology proﬁle and that of each of its alliance partners . The variable is transformed ; the values range from 0 to 100 , with higher values implying increasing distances between the technology portfolio of the focal ﬁrm and that of its alliance partners Network density The number of technological alliances in the network divided by all possible alliances between the networking ﬁrms Betweenness centrality The fraction of shortest paths of alliances between other companies that pass through the focal ﬁrm . We standardized this measure to compare the values across different alliance networks ; values range from 0 to 100 Control variables Age The number of years since a company was founded Firm size ( lnrevenues ) Natural logarithm of the total sales of the ﬁrm in t − 1 ( × 1000 Euro ) R & D intensity R & D expenditures in t − 1 divided by total sales in t − 1 Year Dummy variables for particular year , 1986 – 1997 Chemical company Dummy variable set to one if the ﬁrm is a chemical company ( default = pharmaceutical company ) Car manufacturer Dummy variable set to one if the ﬁrm is a car manufacturer ( default = pharmaceutical company ) Europe Dummy variable set to one if the ﬁrm is headquartered in Europe ( default = Asian company ) US Dummy variable set to one if the ﬁrm is headquartered in the US ( default = Asian company ) inﬂuence a focal ﬁrm has over the information through the alliance network . In other words , it also forms a network - wide ( global ) measureandtakesdirectandindirecttiesinto account . This is important as this indicates how far a ﬁrm canreachpotentiallyall ( includingdistant ) partsofthenet - work . This provides us with an indication of the potential for novel combinations that a ﬁrm may have . We standardized this measure to compare betweenness centralization of ﬁrms across different alliance networks – different years and industries . In theory , standardized val - uescanrangefrom0to100 . Table2indicatesthatthevalues for this variable range from 0 to 38 . On average , ﬁrms have a network position with a low value for betweenness cen - trality , but there are a few companies that are in the midst of the action . Furthermore , we included the interaction terms in the analyses because the hypotheses predict that technologi - cal distance , network density and betweenness centrality interact . Therefore , we standardize these three variables prior to calculating their interaction terms , in order to avoidunnecessarymulticollinearity ( AikenandWest , 1991 ; Rothaermel and Deeds , 2004 ) . 3 . 2 . 3 . Control variables Other variables can of course also affect the explorative innovation performance of these ﬁrms . We included three types of dummy variables . A ﬁrst indicates where the com - pany is headquartered geographically . Following the Triad concept of the world economy , a company can be head - quartered in North America , Asia or Europe ( Ohmae , 1985 ) . Firmsthatareheadquarteredindifferentcountriesmaydif - fer in their propensity to patent . Annual dummy variables were included to capture changes over time in the propen - sity of companies to patent their innovations . Finally , we included a dummy variable to indicate whether a com - pany is a car manufacturer or chemical ﬁrm ( default is the pharmaceutical industry ) . Furthermore , we included three organizational vari - ables as controls . 6 The ﬁrst is the age of the company . Older ﬁrms , with their accumulated experience , are expected to be better at exploitation , and younger ﬁrms , with lower stakes and habituation in old technologies , better at explo - ration . Hence , we expect a negative sign for the coefﬁcient of this variable . The natural logarithm of ‘corporate revenues’ – a proxy for ﬁrm size – was included as a control variable . Firm size is expected to enhance exploitative learning ( Acs and Audretsch , 1991 ) . Large ﬁrms have the ﬁnancial means and vast technological and other resources to invest heav - ily in R & D . However , they usually experience problems in diversifying into new technological areas inhibiting experimentation and favouring specialization along exist - ing technological trajectories ( Levinthal and March , 1993 ; March , 1991 ; Ahuja and Lampert , 2001 ) . As a result , large ﬁrms are disadvantaged with respect to exploring new technological ﬁelds and will innovate proportionally less than smaller ﬁrms in new technological areas ( Nooteboom , 1991 ; Nooteboom and Vossen , 1995 ) . R & D intensity ( R & D expenditures as a percentage of sales ) is expected to have a positive impact on exploration : ﬁrms that invest heavily in R & D will have a higher rate of innovation assuming that there exists a positive cor - relation between technological input and output ( Pakes and Griliches , 1984 ) . R & D investments also play a role in 6 Thosevariableswerecalculatedfortheyearpriortotheyearofobser - vation . V . Gilsing et al . / Research Policy 37 ( 2008 ) 1717 – 1731 1725 the ability of companies to recognise , value and assimi - late external knowledge . Absorptive capacity is crucial to acquire and integrate external knowledge , especially when the knowledge is tacit . Firms conduct R & D to be more able to use the technology of other companies ( Cohen and Levinthal , 1990 ; Kim , 1998 ; Mowery and Oxley , 1995 ) . 3 . 3 . Model estimation The dependent variable is a count variable and only takes nonnegative integer values—i . e . the number of patents a ﬁrm ﬁled for in a particular year in patent classes in which it has not issued patents during the past 5 years . A Poisson regression approach provides a natural baseline model for such data ( Hausman et al . , 1984 ; Henderson and Cockburn , 1996 ) . Since we use pooled cross - section data with several observations on the same ﬁrms at different points in time , we modelled the data using a random - effects Poisson estimation . 7 The basic Poisson model for event count data can be written as follows : Pr ( Y it = y it ) = exp ( − (cid:2) t ) (cid:2) y it it y it ! ( 10 ) where the parameter (cid:2) it represents the mean and the vari - ance of the event count and y it the observed count variable . It is furthermore assumed that : (cid:2) it = ˇ (cid:3) x it . ( 11 ) with x it being a vector of independent variables . The above speciﬁcation assumes that the mean and variance of the event count are equal . However , for pooled cross - section count data the variance often exceeds the mean . This overdispersion is particularly relevant in the case of unobserved heterogeneity . 8 The presence of overdispersion does not bias the regression coefﬁcients but the computed standard errors in the Poisson regression are understated , resultinginanoverestimationofthestatistical signiﬁcance of the coefﬁcients . Therefore , a random - effects Poisson estimator used : it does not assume within - ﬁrm observational independence for the purpose of computing standard errors . For the random - effects Poisson estimator Eq . ( 2 ) is changed into : (cid:2) it = ˇ (cid:3) x it + u i ( 12 ) where u i is a random effect for the i th ﬁrm and reﬂects the ﬁrm - speciﬁc heterogeneity . Unobserved heterogeneity may be the result of differ - ences between companies in their innovation - generating capabilities , and as a consequence in their propensity or ability to patent . Such unobserved heterogeneity , if present andnotcontrolledfor , canleadtooverdispersioninthedata 7 We used a Hausman speciﬁcation test ( 1978 ) to determine the choice betweenarandom - andaﬁxed - effectsmodel . Thistestwasnotsigniﬁcant , indicating that a random - effects model is consistent and efﬁcient for this analysis . 8 OtherpaperswithinthesamecontextasourshavealsousedthePois - sonrandom - effectssuchasAhuja ( 2000a ) —wherehealsostudiestherole of alliances within a context of technological inventions and considers a patent count as the DV .

First , the propensity to patent may be partly determined by the nationality of the companies or the industry to which they belong . Similarly , we introduced annual dummy variables to account for changes over time : they may capture the ever - growingimportanceofintellectualcapitalorchanging macroeconomic conditions . 4 . Results Table 1 represents the description of the different vari - ables . Table 2 provides the descriptive statistics and the correlationsbetweenthevariablesforthe762observations in the sample . Although the sample represents the promi - nent ﬁrms in the three sectors , there is quite some variance in most of the key variables . Table 3 represents the results of the regression anal - ysis using random - effects Poisson estimations to explain explorative innovation performance of the ﬁrms in our sample . The estimated alpha coefﬁcient is positive and signiﬁcant . This indicates that important ﬁrm - level unob - served effects are present in the data and that a panel estimator is preferred above a pooled Poisson estimator . We focus on the full model ( model 6 ) but also provide the basic model with only control variables ( model 1 ) and models that include only one explanatory variable ( models 2 – 4 ) , andamodelincludingthethreeexplanatoryvariables but without the interaction terms ( model 5 ) , to show that the coefﬁcients are robust over the different models and that multicollinearity is not a particular problem in these regressions . Models 2 , 3 and 4 introduce respectively technologi - cal distance , network density and betweenness centrality as explanatory variables . The likelihood ratio tests indi - cate that the three models have more explanatory power than model 1 . In model 2 , the coefﬁcients for the linear and quadratic term of the technological distance variable have the expected sign and are signiﬁcant . This result corrobo - rates Hypothesis 1 . Model 3 introduces the betweenness centrality of each focal ﬁrm and the overall network density as independent variables . Hypothesis 2 , claiming an inverse U - shaped rela - tion between the betweenness centrality and exploration is also corroborated . According to Hypothesis 3 we expect thatexplorationisalsoaninverse - Ushapedfunctionofnet - work density . The positive sign for the linear term and the negative sign for the quadratic term indicate that we also ﬁnd evidence for Hypothesis 3 . The corroboration of the ﬁrst three hypotheses also holds when the three explana - tory variables are simultaneously introduced in model 5 . Model 6 introduces the pairwise interaction terms betweenthethreeexplanatoryvariablestotestHypotheses 4 – 6 . We expect a negative interaction effect between tech - nological distance and betweenness centrality ( Hypothesis 4 ) , a positive interaction effect between technological distance and density ( Hypothesis 5 ) , and a positive inter - action effect between betweenness centrality and density ( Hypothesis 6 ) . As Table 3 shows , the signs of these three interaction terms are correct but the coefﬁcient for the interaction term between technological distance and net - workdensityisnotsigniﬁcant . Asaresult , Hypotheses4and 6areconﬁrmedbutthereisnoconﬁrmationforHypothesis 5 . Thelikelihoodratiotestindicatesthatmodel6compared tomodel5hasmoreexplanatorypower . Inotherwords , the introduction of the three interaction terms is important in explaining ﬁrms’ exploratory innovation performance . There are also some interesting conclusions to draw from the control variables in Table 3 . First , the coefﬁcients are stable over all the models , indicating the robustness of the results . Next , there are signiﬁcant differences between the three industries ( chemical industry , car manufactur - ing and pharmaceutical industry ) in their propensity to get involved in explorative innovation . The country of ori - gin of the different companies plays no role in explaining exploratory innovation . Size has a positive and signiﬁcant effect on the rate of innovation when ﬁrms are exploring new technological areas . Sincethisexplanatoryvariableisinlogform , itscoef - ﬁcient in the Poisson speciﬁcation can be interpreted as the elasticity between ﬁrm size and the dependent variable . The coefﬁcient is substantially smaller than one suggest - ing – ceteris paribus – that the frequency of patenting increases with ﬁrm size but less than proportionately . As a result , small ﬁrms are more innovative than larger ﬁrms when they explore new technologies . This is in line with the results of previous research on the relation between ﬁrmsizeandR & D ( NooteboomandVossen , 1995 ) , andwith research showing that new and more radical inventions are likely to originate within SMEs rather than in large ﬁrms ( Leifer et al . , 2000 ; Utterback , 1994 ; Christensen , 1997 ) . This ﬁnding is also in line with the organizational learning literature : large established organizations have difﬁcul - ties in diversifying into new technological areas , inhibiting experimentation and favouring specialization along exist - ing technological trajectories ( Levinthal and March , 1993 ; March , 1991 ; Ahuja and Lampert , 2001 ) . Asexpected , R & Dintensityhasapositiveandsigniﬁcant effect on the innovation rate of the companies in the sam - ple . The age of the ﬁrm has a negative but non - signiﬁcant effect on exploratory patents . This result suggests that established companies that had time to develop capabil - ities in particular technological ﬁelds do not necessarily have a competitive advantage over new entrants in the exploration of new technological ﬁelds . By contrast , the negativecoefﬁcientforageindicatesthatnewlyestablished ﬁrms might have a slight advantage in exploring new tech - nological ﬁelds ( although the evidence is inconclusive as the coefﬁcient is not statistically signiﬁcant ) , in line with previous research on the role of new ﬁrms in the creation of new technologies ( Methe et al . , 1997 ) . 5 . Discussion and conclusions The joint impact of the three explanatory variables is best understood and consistent with the theoretical analy - sis ( as speciﬁed in formulae 6 – 8 ) , if we take all variables in model6 – linear , quadraticandinteractionterms – simulta - neously into consideration . To keep the analysis tractable , we start from the observation that ﬁrms can control or inﬂuence relations only with their direct partners and have 1728 V . Gilsing et al . / Research Policy 37 ( 2008 ) 1717 – 1731 Fig . 2 . Explorativeinnovationperformanceatmeanlevelofnetworkden - sity . virtually no possibilities to do so beyond their ego - network ( Bae and Gargiulo , 2003 ) . Therefore , it seems reasonable to consider global density as an exogenous variable for the innovating ﬁrms . That leaves them with two variables for dealing with their alliance network when engaging in explorationendeavours , namelytheirnetworkpositionand the technological distance with their partners . Consider Fig . 2 that represents the joint effect of tech - nologicaldistanceandnetworkcentrality , keepingnetwork density constant at the mean level . As the ﬁgure shows , a ( highly ) central position in the network yields ample potential for a high exploration per - formance , if one works with partners at a very limited technological distance , and when supported by ‘sufﬁcient’ density ( mean level ) . However , if working from such a central position with partners that operate at a large ( r ) technological distance , performance drops rapidly . The interpretation of this ﬁnding may be as follows . Being highly central implies a higher chance of being faced with different kinds of knowledge and information ( Burt , 1992 ) . This is beneﬁcial for novelty value but also creates a need to understand and integrate potentially unrelated infor - mation . Therefore , being a highly central player requires exploration at small technological distances in order to be able to absorb knowledge from all parts of the network . The price for not doing so is a sharp decrease in one’s inno - vation performance . Also note that the highest impact on explorative innovation performance is found for ﬁrms with a central position especially at a very small technological distance . In contrast , a highly peripheral position ( at very low or minimal BC ) is a liability as it shows a much lower perfor - mance compared to more central positions , although such positions initially show an increase in innovation perfor - mance when technological distance increases . Moreover , being at the periphery can be advantageous at very high levels of technological distance , where more central ﬁrms perform comparatively less well . Being at the periphery generally implies that one is outside the immediate sight of dominant and more central players . Because of this , selec - tion forces to comply with dominant designs and existing Fig . 3 . Explorativeinnovationperformanceatmeanleveloftechnological distance . systems of production , organization , technical standards and so on , may be somewhat less stringent . Hence , deviat - ing from such prevailing ‘industry recipes’ ( Spender , 1989 ) becomes easier ( Gilsing and Nooteboom , 2005 ) . As a con - sequence , ﬁrms at the periphery may enjoy more freedom to experiment with partners at a high technological dis - tance . It might be that this strategy yields more radical innovations with potentially more technological and eco - nomic value . However , the way we measure our dependent variable ( based on patent counts ) does not take this into account , an issue we come back to when discussing limita - tions and possibilities for future research . Still , ﬁrms also need to consider the degree of over - all density and how it conditions their choices regarding position and technological distance respectively . Consider therefore Fig . 3 , showing the relation between density and betweenness centrality while keeping technological dis - tance at its mean value . Here we see that the effect of density on innovation performance has a similar , curvilinear effect for both cen - tralandperipheralpositions . Inotherwords , irrespectiveof one’s position , high density inhibits the existence and uti - lizationofdiversity , andhenceofnoveltyvalue , whileatlow levels it does not support absorption sufﬁciently . We also ﬁnd the highest impact on explorative innovation perfor - mance at intermediate levels of betweenness centrality ( at leastwhentechnologicaldistanceiskeptatthemeanlevel ) . However , a closer look at Fig . 3 reveals that high levels of networkdensityincombinationwithhighlevelsofcentral - ity also offer a fairly high impact on exploration . In short , we can say that at average technological distances , central companies in ( fairly ) dense networks have an advantaged position to develop explorative innovations . Following our ﬁndings , we can conclude that our key argument is conﬁrmed , claiming that successful explo - ration requires a delicate balance between the ‘twin tasks’ ofnoveltycreationontheonehandanditsefﬁcientabsorp - tion on the other hand . We found that highly central ﬁrms enjoy the strongest improvements of their explo - rative innovation performance and this effect declines V . Gilsing et al . / Research Policy 37 ( 2008 ) 1717 – 1731 1729 steadily when centrality decreases , or alternatively when technologicaldistanceincreases . Peripheralpositionsshow the least performance , although such positions can be attractive when cooperating with partners at a very large technological distance . In other words , success rates for exploration are not spread equally across network posi - tions . However , position alone does not tell the full story . Our empirical ﬁndings clearly indicate that exploration success also depends on the two other dimensions of embedded - ness , namely technological distance and network density . Therefore , an important conclusion is that the three ele - ments of network embeddedness need to be considered jointly in order to understand their complementary effects on both novelty creation and absorptive capacity . This is an important ﬁnding and contributes to the literature in several ways . Oneisthatitcontrastswiththetraditionintheliterature on alliances and interﬁrm networks with its bias towards to the role of position ( Powell et al . , 2005 ) . The message as conveyed from this study is that for exploration the value of a position depends on the technological distance from others and on the degree of network density . A second contribution is that the social network liter - ature speciﬁcally considers ‘social distance’ between any two nodes ( here ﬁrms ) in the network , in terms of the number of links on the shortest path between them . Here we have added technological distance between any two ﬁrms . This has enabled us to go beyond the dominant focus on partners’ similarity and to understand the pos - itive role of technological distance in exploration . Such a cognition - based view has been largely ignored by the lit - erature with its main focus on the role of economic and social factors regarding alliance formation and the role of network embeddedness ( Gulati , 1998 ; Phelps , 2005 ) . It also contributes to the literature on learning and innovation that stresses the recombination potential aris - ing from distances in cognition ( Nelson and Winter , 1982 ; Nooteboom , 2000 ; Malerba , 2004 ) , but leaves unexplained what are the associated social structural implications . Moreover , considering the role of global density enables one to go beyond the dyadic level , as has been mostly stud - ied in the literature ( Salancik , 1995 ; Gulati , 1998 ; Powell et al . , 2005 ) . The focus on dyads reﬂects an undersocialized view of alliances and ignores how far positive effects of a central or peripheral position can be mitigated or ampli - ﬁed by the entire structure . We found that this structure , in terms of its density , indeed plays an important role and conditions the potential beneﬁts of different degrees of centrality for exploration . Both for central and peripheral positions an intermediate degree of density seems to be mosteffective . Incontrast , highlevelsofdensitymayinhibit the existence and utilization of diversity , and hence of nov - eltyvalue , whileatlowlevelsitdoesnotsupportabsorption sufﬁciently . Thispointstoaninterestingnewinsightthatshedsadif - ferent light on the validity of the arguments of Burt versus Coleman . Success in exploration requires a dual empha - sis on the beneﬁts of non - redundant contacts for potential novel combinations as well as on network density for inte - grating the diverse inputs obtained from such contacts . In other words , it seems that both views convey some truth and may be seen as complements instead of opposites as stressed in the literature ( Hansen , 1999 ; McEvily and Zaheer , 1999 ; Rowley et al . , 2000 ; Ahuja , 2000b ) . Limitations of this study , which may provide directions for future research , are as follows . One is that we have stud - ied exploration that is new to the ﬁrm . In other words , we cannot substantiate our claims and ﬁndings beyond this relatively moderate degree of exploration . It therefore seems useful in future studies to consider more radical degrees of exploration such as the discovery of ‘newly emerging’ technologies ( new to the industry ) or ‘pioneer - ing’ technologies ( new to the world ) , respectively ( Ahuja and Lampert , 2001 ) . For these kinds of exploration one needs partners at presumably ( much ) larger technological distances than considered here and we anticipate that this will have major implications for the role of both between - ness centrality and density . A second limitation relates to our dependent variable . We have counted the number of explorative patents for eachﬁrmandinthiswayhavetreatedallpatentsequally . Of course , patents differ in technological and economic value , and taking this into account would deﬁnitely enrich future work in this ﬁeld . Weighing patents based on the number of citations that they receive seems a straightforward way to do this ( Ahuja and Lampert , 2001 ) . Such an approach would also enable studying the validity of our conjecture that peripheral ﬁrms have better possibilities for more rad - ical exploration when compared with central ﬁrms . A ﬁnal limitation is that we did not consider the effect of ‘tie strength’ on exploration . Different types of alliances can be weighted according to the ‘strength’ of the relationship as someauthorshavedone ( seeContractorandLorange , 1988 ; Gulati , 1995b ; Nohria and Garcia - Pont , 1991 ) . This would requireadditionalresearchregardingwhichalliancetypeis more instrumental for the exploration of new technologies .
