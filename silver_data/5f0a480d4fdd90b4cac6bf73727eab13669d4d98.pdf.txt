Temporal analysis of phosphotyrosine - dependent signaling networks by quantitative proteomics Blagoy Blagoev 1 , 2 , Shao - En Ong 1 , 2 , Irina Kratchmarova 1 & Matthias Mann 1 To study the global dynamics of phosphotyrosine - based signaling events in early growth factor stimulation , we developed a mass spectrometric method that converts temporal changes to differences in peptide isotopic abundance . The proteomes of three cell populations were metabolically encoded with different stable isotopic forms of arginine . Each population was stimulated by epidermal growth factor for a different length of time , and tyrosine - phosphorylated proteins and closely associated binders were afﬁnity puriﬁed . Arginine - containing peptides occurred in three forms , which were quantiﬁed ; we then combined two experiments to generate ﬁve - point dynamic proﬁles . We identiﬁed 81 signaling proteins , including virtually all known epidermal growth factor receptor substrates , 31 novel effectors and the time course of their activation upon epidermal growth factor stimulation . Global activation proﬁles provide an informative perspective on cell signaling and will be crucial to modeling signaling networks in a systems biology approach . In growth factor signaling , stimulation of cell - surface receptors ﬁrst triggers activation of the receptor itself and then of a large number of intracellular effector molecules 1 – 3 . The stimulus is integrated with a host of other cellular processes , leading to cytoskeletal changes , activating transcriptional programs in the nucleus and ultimately resulting in cell proliferation , differentiation or motility . Classical signaling pathways and networks depict potential protein - protein interactions only in a static form . In the cell , these interactions are dynamic and occur in an ordered fashion . So far , there have been no experimental methods for learning about the dynamics of protein activation and interaction at the proteomic scale . Dynamic proﬁling using phosphospeciﬁc antibodies or ﬂuorescence - based methods has had to be done one protein at a time , in different cell lines and different conditions , making it virtually impossible to obtain a global kinetic proﬁle of interaction or activation . Large - scale mapping of phosphorylation sites has shown great promise 4 , 5 , but has only given a partial picture of signaling dynamics . Here we address this important practical and conceptual problem by studying the temporal dimension of the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) signaling network as a model system . The critical step in early growth factor signaling is tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor and subsequently of key substrates . This leads to activation of these proteins and recruitment of signaling partners . The tyrosine phosphorylation status of any protein over time thus indicates its temporal involvement in the signaling process . We therefore devised a proteomics strategy to enable global , time - depen - dent analysis of the EGFR phosphotyrosine proteome ( Fig . 1 ) . Quantitative proteomics is useful not only for the measurement of protein abundance levels 6 – 8 but also for differential labeling of protein populations in functional experiments 9 , 10 . Previously , our laboratory described a mass spectrometry – based approach termed stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture ( SILAC ) 11 , 12 . One cell population is grown in medium containing normal arginine and another population is grown in medium with 13 C - substituted arginine until the arginine is completely incorporated into each protein in the cell . The only difference between the two proteomes is the form of arginine in the proteins , making their peptides distinguishable by mass spectrometry . Because the proteome is com - pletely labeled at the start of the experiment , protein synthesis and degradation have no effect on measured signal intensities , unlike in the case of classical metabolic labeling with radioisotopes . Therefore , relative peak heights of the peptides are a direct measure of the relative amounts of the proteins . So far , quantitative proteomic methods have been used to compare only two states , such as ‘on - off’ or disease versus normal . Here we introduce a second isotopic label , allowing simultaneous quantiﬁca - tion of three cellular states , for example , different time points of growth factor treatment ( Fig . 1a ) . Three populations of HeLa cells were grown in media containing different versions of arginine , leading to mass separation of the arginine - containing peptides by 6 or 10 Da ( see Fig . 1 ) . The cells were stimulated for different lengths of time with epidermal growth factor ( EGF ; 150 ng / ml ) , lysed and their combined cell extracts immunoprecipitated with anti - phosphotyrosine antibo - dies ( 4G10 and P - Tyr - 100 ) . Arginine - containing peptides generated by proteolytic cleavage of eluted proteins occur as triplets in the mass spectra ( Fig . 1b ) . The intensity of each peak directly indicates the relative amount of the tyrosine - phosphorylated protein or its binding partners at the corresponding time point of growth factor treatment . To obtain a higher - resolution time proﬁle of the phosphotyrosine phosphoproteome , we combined two three - state experiments . The unstimulated cells were divided to serve as a common zero point for both three - state experiments , resulting in a combined time proﬁle for 0 , 1 , 5 , 10 and 20 min .

This can lead to relatively large standard deviations for some proteins with low basal phosphorylation , but the curve shapes are still highly constrained , as discussed in Methods and the Supplementary Figure 1 online . We determined the activation proﬁle of 202 proteins , precipitated by anti - phosphotyrosine antibodies , upon EGF stimulation . Of these , 81 showed a 1 . 5 fold or higher change in at least one time point and are listed in Table 1 . Although the SILAC technique can quantify changes smaller than 10 % ( ref . 12 ) , we chose 1 . 5 as a conservative cutoff for biological signiﬁcance . Signaling factors are frequently of very low abundance , making their detection and quantiﬁcation a challenge to mass spectrometry . To estimate the coverage of the EGF tyrosine phosphoproteome achieved in our study , we ﬁrst compared the identiﬁed proteins against the results of our previous proteomic screens in the EGF system 13 – 15 and found that indeed all proteins were present . Second , we surveyed the literature for known effector molecules of EGF in early signaling events . We found 50 such proteins , and all appeared in our screen ( marked in Table 1 ) . These effectors have been determined by a wide variety of biochemical and genetic methods , many of which have no sensitivity bias . Third , in sensitivity - limited analysis of complex mixtures , many proteins are identiﬁed by only one peptide . However , we sequenced at least two peptides for all proteins listed in Table 1 . Furthermore , peptides from these proteins were observed in both of the experiments used to construct the dynamic proﬁle . The above evidence strongly suggests that we have covered an extensive part of the EGF - induced phosphoproteome . Our approach retrieved proteins that were tyrosine phosphorylated by the activated EGF receptor as well as by downstream kinases . Tyrosine phosphorylation also triggers interactions of signaling factors that are not necessarily phosphorylated themselves . For example , the adapter protein Grb2 was probably identiﬁed in our screen through its association with activated EGFR . As such proteins bind to phosphorylated partners in a stimulation - dependent manner and play roles in the signaling cascade , we use the term ‘activation’ for these molecules as well . We compared the proﬁles obtained by quantitative proteomics with those from standard western blot analyses . For this purpose , we grew and stimulated HeLa cells under the same experimental conditions used for the proteomic experiments up to the point of immunoprecipitation . Lysates derived from the different time points of stimulation were then immunoprecipitated separately with phosphotyrosine antibodies . We strove to obtain antibodies against proteins representing different classes of dynamic proﬁles for immunoblotting . As can be seen in Figure 2 and Table 1 , the western blots were consistent with the results from quantitative mass spectrometry for all the proteins tested , including for a novel protein we generated antibodies against . Activation proﬁles for some of the key proteins in EGF signaling are presented in Figure 3a , b . The receptor itself is activated about 40 - fold within 1 min , remains fully activated for 5 min and then slowly decreases to less than half the peak value at the last measured time point at 20 min . Eps15 and the E3 ubiquitin ligase c - Cbl show the same kinetics as the receptor , but with lower fold activation . These two proteins are known to be recruited early to the activated EGFR and to play an important role in early steps of receptor internalization 16 , 17 . Because Cbl transfers the ubiquitin to EGFR , it is not surprising that the proﬁle of ubiquitinated receptor ( quantiﬁed from ubiquitin peptides derived from the same gel band as the receptor ) is delayed compared with EGFR and Cbl . The ubiquitinated receptor is recog - nized by HRS and STAM / STAM2 ( ref . 18 ) , which are involved in the subsequent events of EGFR endosomal trafﬁcking . Consistent with this role , their activation proﬁle is delayed with respect to that of the ubiquitinated receptor ( Fig . 3a ) . In canonical growth factor signaling , the activated receptor recruits adaptor proteins that bring to the plasma membrane guanine exchange factors for small GTPases such as Ras , Rac and Rho , which then relay the signal to downstream effectors . For example , Ras signals to Raf and EGF receptor peptide ( NLQEILHGAVR ) STAM2 peptide ( DFATEVR ) Myosin regulatory light polypeptide 9 ( GNFNYVEFTR ) 624 626 628 630 1 R e l a t i v e i n t en s i t y m / z 624 626 628 630 1 R e l a t i v e i n t en s i t y m / z 625 627 629 631 40 R e l a t i v e i n t en s i t y m / z 625 627 629 631 40 R e l a t i v e i n t en s i t y m / z 419 421 423 425 15 R e l a t i v e i n t en s i t y m / z 419 421 423 425 10 R e l a t i v e i n t en s i t y m / z EGF ( min ) 0 1 10 EGF ( min ) 0 5 20 Digestion with trypsin Protein identification and quantification by LC - MS 0 min EGF Mix lysates 1 : 1 : 1 1 min EGF 10 min EGF 12 C6 14 N4 - Arg 13 C6 14 N4 - Arg 13 C6 15 N4 - Arg Affinity purification with anti - pTyr antibodies 6 Da 4 Da 1 1 1 1 a b Figure 1 Determining the activation proﬁle of the EGFR phosphotyrosine - dependent proteome . ( a ) Cells are grown in medium with one of three different forms of arginine such that this amino acid is completely incorporated into the proteome . Each population is stimulated by EGF for the indicated time interval and lysed . Lysates are mixed and tyrosine - phosphorylated proteins afﬁnity puriﬁed , followed by tryptic digestion and mass spectrometric analysis . The experiment is then repeated for another triplet of time points to obtain a higher resolution proﬁle . ( b ) Peptide mass spectra of three different proteins displaying distinct activation proﬁles . The peptide GNFNYVEFTR of myosin light chain in the upper left panel shows three isotope distributions with the same intensity ( stimulation for 0 , 1 and 10 min ) . The upper right panel shows the stimulation for 0 , 5 and 20 min . This phosphoprotein was therefore basally phosphorylated and did not change at the ﬁve time points of EGF stimulation . The peptide NLQEILHGAVR of EGFR in the middle panels displays a rapid increase from the 0 time point ( intensity set equal to one ) through the 1 - and 5 - min points , followed by a decrease at the 10 - and 20 - min points . The lower panels show the peptide DFATEVR of STAM2 . The increase is slower with a maximum between 10 and 15 min . 1140 VOLUME 22 NUMBER 9 SEPTEMBER 2004 NATURE BIOTECHNOLOGY L E T T E R S © 2004 N a t u r e P ub li s h i ng G r oup h tt p : / / www . n a t u r e . c o m / n a t u r e b i o t ec hno l og y activates a mitogen - activated protein ( MAP ) kinase cascade that transmits the signal into the nucleus . Consistent with this sequence , a chronological ordering of dynamic proﬁles from EGFR via adaptors ( Grb2 , Shc ) and guanine exchange factors ( GEFs ; Sos1 / 2 ) to MAP kinases was observed ( Fig . 3b ) . Interestingly , Sos activation decays faster than Grb2 activation ( Fig . 3b ) , which may correlate with nega - tive feedback mechanisms dissociating Sos from the activated EGFR - Grb2 complex 19 . We also note that two MAP kinases , Erk and p38 , showed different activation proﬁles , although both have the same posi - tion in the signaling cascade and translocate into the nucleus ( Fig . 3b ) . One of the major effects of growth factor stimulation is the rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton through small GTPases . Figure 3c shows the dynamics of Arp2 / 3 , a complex responsible for the branching of actin microﬁlaments . Arp2 / 3 has a maximum at 5 min , followed by another increase at the 20 - min time point . We quantiﬁed nine Arp2 / 3 members ; strikingly , all display the same Table 1 Proteins activated upon EGF stimulation Protein name 1 min 5 min 10 min 20 min Protein name 1 min 5 min 10 min 20 min Upregulated proteins Known effectors of EGFR signaling EGFR 39 40 31 . 5 17 . 8 PLC - gamma 29 . 7 11 3 . 2 2 . 8 ErbB 2 35 30 18 . 5 9 . 7 PI 3 - kinase , p85 - alpha 1 . 3 1 . 8 1 . 6 1 . 2 Eps15 34 28 . 6 17 . 9 2 . 8 STAT 5 19 . 7 19 . 1 4 . 6 2 . 1 c - Cbl 23 . 6 20 . 5 8 . 8 3 . 7 Annexin I 9 . 3 10 2 . 7 1 . 7 Cbl - B 3 . 5 3 . 6 2 . 7 1 . 7 Vav - 2 2 . 6 1 . 7 1 . 6 1 . 2 Ubiquitin 10 . 7 30 . 1 18 . 7 5 . 9 Vav - 3 4 . 0 3 . 8 2 . 5 2 . 2 Hrs 1 . 6 25 . 4 33 . 2 7 . 6 Tubulin alpha - 1 1 . 6 1 . 62 1 . 6 1 . 3 STAM 2 . 8 24 . 0 57 . 1 8 . 06 Tubulin beta - 2 1 . 5 1 . 5 1 . 4 1 . 2 STAM 2 1 . 1 7 . 1 15 . 4 2 . 1 ARF GAP , GIT1 1 . 5 2 . 0 1 . 5 1 . 06 Shc 5 . 6 6 . 0 3 . 7 2 . 9 Srcasm 2 . 7 6 . 8 2 . 6 1 . 5 Grb 2 1 . 6 1 . 4 1 . 4 1 . 3 Ras GAP - like protein IQGAP1 1 . 7 2 . 0 1 . 06 1 . 1 Sos 1 1 . 6 1 . 6 0 . 78 0 . 76 AP - 2 , beta 1 subunit 1 . 5 2 . 1 1 . 9 1 . 9 Sos 2 1 . 7 1 . 8 1 . 2 1 . 4 Clathrin light chain A 0 . 9 1 . 2 1 . 6 1 . 4 Erk 2 1 . 8 8 . 6 6 . 1 1 . 7 ACK1 3 . 0 3 . 2 3 . 9 0 . 9 p38 MAP kinase 1 . 0 2 . 1 4 . 0 1 . 2 Acid phosphatase 1 2 . 1 2 . 84 2 . 6 1 . 94 p62Dok 18 . 1 10 . 2 4 . 7 1 . 0 Vimentin 2 . 1 0 . 92 1 . 9 0 . 7 DOC 2 13 . 3 16 . 0 4 . 2 3 . 2 Desmoglein 2 13 . 5 9 . 71 6 . 2 4 . 2 SHIP 2 34 . 0 19 . 1 5 . 3 1 . 9 Gamma - catenin 4 . 8 4 . 0 2 . 1 1 . 4 Odin 8 . 3 6 . 3 3 . 0 1 . 8 Proteins not previously reported in EGFR signaling hnRNP R 8 . 1 10 14 . 5 10 Nuclear domain 10 protein 3 . 1 7 . 8 4 . 8 2 . 1 hnRNP A2 / B1 6 . 0 1 . 5 1 . 45 1 . 3 ADP , ATP carrier protein 1 . 7 1 . 77 1 . 5 1 . 32 hnRNP Q2 2 . 2 3 . 9 2 . 9 2 . 22 Sorcin 7 . 2 4 . 7 3 . 3 1 . 5 hnRNP JKTBP 1 . 1 1 . 5 1 . 6 1 . 2 N - cadherin 4 . 6 3 . 3 1 . 3 1 . 1 DEAD - box protein 3 22 . 8 32 . 7 21 . 1 15 . 58 WW domain binding protein 2 2 . 9 2 . 5 2 . 2 1 . 3 Major vault protein 1 . 7 2 . 5 1 . 1 0 . 97 HECT domain protein LASU1 2 . 6 9 . 8 5 . 1 1 . 95 Axl 1 . 2 1 . 4 1 . 6 1 . 5 PDCD6 - interacting protein 2 . 0 8 . 8 37 2 . 8 Anthrax toxin receptor 1 . 2 1 . 7 5 . 3 6 . 6 Syntenin 1 1 . 4 2 . 1 5 . 1 3 . 3 Transferrin receptor 1 1 . 1 2 . 2 9 . 8 6 . 9 TOM1 - like protein 2 a 3 . 9 14 . 6 8 . 5 1 . 7 Protein kinase PKX1 111 89 3 . 2 3 . 2 Ymer a 42 60 18 . 8 7 . 1 CYLD 23 . 9 22 . 2 17 . 1 2 . 9 LIM domains containing 1 a 2 . 4 2 . 0 1 . 3 1 . 1 ARF GAP , GIT2 1 . 19 2 . 1 1 . 4 1 . 1 FLJ21610 a 14 . 3 5 . 7 3 . 0 1 . 7 Centaurin delta 2 29 . 6 14 . 4 7 . 4 1 . 8 FLJ00269 a 3 . 2 1 . 7 1 . 22 0 . 7 Rho GEF 7 1 . 03 1 . 8 1 . 09 1 . 1 Downregulated proteins Known effectors of EGFR signaling ARP 2 / 3 , subunit 1A 0 . 58 1 . 07 0 . 44 0 . 72 ARP2 / 3 , 34 kDa subunit 0 . 72 1 . 04 0 . 51 0 . 76 ARP2 / 3 , 20 kDa subunit 0 . 60 1 . 00 0 . 43 0 . 72 ARP2 / 3 , 16 kDa subunit 0 . 80 1 . 02 0 . 54 0 . 71 ARP2 / 3 , 21 kDa subunit 0 . 63 1 . 06 0 . 47 0 . 69 Gelsolin 0 . 71 0 . 99 0 . 66 0 . 80 Similar to ARP2 / 3 , sub 5 0 . 60 1 . 06 0 . 49 0 . 78 p130Cas / BCAR 1 0 . 44 0 . 57 0 . 66 0 . 76 ARP2 / 3 , 41 kDa subunit 0 . 79 1 . 05 0 . 49 0 . 74 Annexin A2 0 . 68 0 . 64 0 . 65 0 . 76 ARP3 0 . 61 1 . 06 0 . 46 0 . 70 Cytochrome c 0 . 59 0 . 22 0 . 15 0 . 11 ARP2 0 . 62 1 . 07 0 . 53 0 . 81 Proteins not previously reported in EGFR signaling AND - 34 / BCAR 3 0 . 67 0 . 70 0 . 82 0 . 81 Endothelial lectin HL - 2 0 . 23 0 . 16 0 . 17 0 . 30 NDP kinase B 0 . 85 0 . 66 0 . 78 0 . 66 Swiprosin 1 a 0 . 59 1 . 03 0 . 61 0 . 94 The upper part of the table shows proteins with at least 1 . 5 - fold activation and the lower part proteins with at least 1 . 5 - fold downregulation .

NATURE BIOTECHNOLOGY VOLUME 22 NUMBER 9 SEPTEMBER 2004 1141 L E T T E R S © 2004 N a t u r e P ub li s h i ng G r oup h tt p : / / www . n a t u r e . c o m / n a t u r e b i o t ec hno l og y quantitative behavior . Although the data do not indicate whether Arp2 / 3 subunits are directly tyrosine phosphorylated , it is clear from Figure 3c as well as from western blots ( Fig . 2 ) that Arp2 / 3’s involvement goes through at least two peaks in the time scale studied here . This is further supported by the very small standard deviation of quantiﬁcation ( Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig . 1c online ) . Interestingly , Gelsolin , which is known to be tyrosine phos - phorylated and to actively participate in actin dynamics , has the same proﬁle as the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Fig . 3c ) 20 . A novel protein , Swiprosin 1 , exhibits the same dynamics ( Fig . 3c ) , suggesting a potential role in growth factor – dependent actin remodeling . Figure 3c also shows p130CAS and AND - 34 , two proteins with a unique proﬁle of rapid decrease upon stimulation and slow recovery of activity over the 20 - min period . Although AND - 34 has not previously been tied to EGF signaling , both proteins are known to be tyrosine phosphorylated and can interact with each other 21 . Another shared feature is that they were both found in screens for antiestrogen resistance genes in breast cancer cells , where they were termed BCAR1 and BCAR3 , respectively 22 , 23 . Thus , common function can be reﬂected in common activation proﬁles . Almost all of the known proteins in Table 1 are readily associated with growth factor signaling . One exception is a group of six RNA - binding proteins , with different levels and kinetics of upregulation ( Table 1 ) . Although the role of RNA - associated proteins has not usually been studied in this context , connections to the regulation of mRNA stability have been observed 24 . Four of the six RNA binding proteins in Table 1 are heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins , one is an RNA helicase , and the ﬁnal one , major vault protein , is a component of a large cytosolic RNP complex . Six of the proteins in Table 1 are novel , with no associated functional information . We already connected Swiprosin 1 with actin rearrangement through its time proﬁle ( see above ) . The activa - tion proﬁles of the other ﬁve are shown in Figure 3d . One of these is predicted to be an atypical protein kinase , and its activation proﬁle associates it with early events at the plasma membrane . Another novel protein contains three LIM domains . LIM domain proteins have been found in proteins that associate with actin ﬁlaments 25 , and , in the example of the LIM domain – containing protein Enigma , shown to associate with receptor tyrosine kinases 26 . Because this protein also showed the same early activation proﬁle , it may be involved in early actin remodeling . A third protein with an early activation proﬁle contains an ATPase domain but no other recognizable domain structure or obvious homology . TOM1 - like protein 2 is a novel protein named for its homology to TOM1 - like protein 1 / Srcasm , which interacts with several adapter proteins in a phosphotyrosine - dependent manner 27 . Like Srcasm , the novel protein has a VHS domain , which implicates it in endosomal trafﬁcking 28 . Further support for this functional context comes from the fact that the time proﬁle for Hrs is very similar to that of the novel protein ( Fig . 3a , d ) . The ﬁnal novel protein did not contain any recognizable domains or homology to known proteins . We raised an antibody against it , and the dynamic proﬁle observed by western blotting ( Fig . 2 ) fully correlates with the time proﬁle obtained by quantitative proteomics ( Fig . 3d ) . Continuing our tradition of naming growth - factor substrates after ﬁgures from Nordic mythology , we termed this molecule Ymer . This single unbiased study reveals virtually the entire known set of tyrosine - phosphorylated effectors of EGFR and the time proﬁle of their involvement . We classiﬁed the 81 effectors into major categories , recognizing that signaling molecules may have several functional roles ( see Supplementary Table 1 online ) . Only about a third of the proteins appear to have direct roles in transducing the signal to the cell nucleus . At least as many participate in cytoskeletal remodeling and cell adhesion . Of the remaining third , half are involved in receptor downregulation and signal termination . We found ten proteins that directly regulate the activities of the small GTPases , a ﬁnding con - sistent with their key role in signal transduction ( Supplementary Table 1 online ) . Our data provide insight into early EGFR signaling . Many proteins not previously known to be linked with EGFR signaling were identiﬁed . The data also contain information about a rich variety of growth factor – related phenomena . For example , we observed the transactivation of several transmembrane receptors , including tyrosine kinase receptors ( Axl ) as well as G - protein coupled receptors ( Anthrax toxin receptor ; Table 1 ) . As another example , STAT5 is known to be activated by EGFR but it is unclear if this activation is direct or indirect 3 . Because STAT5 is immediately activated , with the same kinetics as the receptor , our data suggest that the activation is direct . The tumor suppressor CYLD has recently been shown to be a critical regulator of NF kappa B – dependent apoptosis , and our data now link this protein to EGFR signaling 29 – 31 . Likewise , the RNA binding proteins found in this study may help open up another area of growth factor signaling .

One difﬁculty in modeling has been the complexity of the system , caused by its many interdependencies and absence of in vivo rate constants . Our global view of EGF stimulation should help modeling efforts in three ways : by providing a much more complete ‘cast of characters’ as well as the magnitude of their activation ; by allowing temporal ordering of the participants in the signaling net - work ; and by providing a strong constraint on possible models , which will have to reproduce the measured activation curves for each protein . Our temporal analysis can be extended to many other cellular situations . Other systems that involve tyrosine phosphorylation cas - cades can be studied in the same way . Different afﬁnity strategies , such as the use of recombinant domains as bait 10 , would allow other signaling questions to be addressed . Furthermore , when enriching phosphopeptides instead of phosphoproteins 4 , 5 , the time course of any individual phosphorylation site can , in principle , be determined . The strategy of triple labeling is likely to ﬁnd use beyond the study of temporal variations . For example , it would be interesting to examine response to pharmacological agents by a stepwise increase of the dose . Finally , this global approach to growth factor signaling will also help in understanding and modeling growth deregulation in cancer and metabolic disorders . METHODS Materials and reagents .

Each medium with the full complement of amino acids and the speciﬁc form of arginine was sterile - ﬁltered through a 0 . 22 m m ﬁlter ( Milipore ) and divided into two lots—for dialyzed serum - containing and serum - free media . HeLa cells were grown in DMEM - labeling medium , prepared as described above , supplemented with 2 mM L - glutamine , and 10 % dialyzed fetal bovine serum plus antibiotics , in a humidiﬁed atmosphere with 5 % CO 2 in air . Cells were grown for at least six cell divisions in labeling medium and were placed in serum - free medium 16 h before EGF stimulation . Immunoprecipitation and western blotting . HeLa cells labeled with either L - arginine , L - arginine - U - 13 C6 14 N4 or L - arginine - U - 13 C6 - 15 N4 ( 5 (cid:1) 10 7 cells per condition ) were treated with 150 ng / ml of EGF for 0 min , 1 min and 10 min . A second similarly labeled set of HeLa cells were treated with EGF for 0 min , 5 min and 20 min , respectively . All treatments were carried out at 37 1 C . The cells were then lysed in a buffer containing 1 % NP - 40 , 0 . 1 % sodium deoxycholate , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 50 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 1 mM sodium orthovanadate and protease inhibitors ( Complete tablets , Roche Diagnostics ) . The lysates were centrifuged at 14 , 000 g to pellet cellular debris . A Bradford assay was performed to equalize protein concentrations for subsequent 1 : 1 : 1 ( L - arginine , L - arginine - U - 13 C 614 N4 , L - arginine - U - 13 C6 - 15 N4 ) mixing of the lysates before the immunoprecipitation step . The unstimulated Arg - 0 cells served as a common reference point in the two experimental sets , and lysates from these cells were pooled and divided into two equal lots for mixing with treated samples . Mixed lysates were pre - cleaned on protein A beads for 1 h to reduce nonspeciﬁc binding of abundant proteins . Protein A beads were separated from lysates by passing the mixture through a Econo - Pac column ( Bio - Rad ) . Agarose - conjugated anti - phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 was incubated with each of the two sets of pre - cleaned lysates for 2 h followed by addition of agarose - conjugated anti - phosphotyrosine P - Tyr - 100 for an additional 4 h . Precipitated complexes were then washed with 30 column volumes of lysis buffer and proteins were subsequently eluted with ﬁve column volumes of glycine pH 2 . 4 . The eluate was neutralized with a neutralizing buffer containing 2 M Tris , pH 8 . 0 , 1 . 5 M NaCl , 1 mM EDTA and concentrated on Centricon Spin columns ( 10 kDa MW cutoff ; Milipore ) for separation on a NuPAGE 4 % – 12 % Bis - Tris gel ( Invitrogen ) .

The two gel lanes ( one for 0 , 1 and 10 min and one for 0 , 5 and 20 min of stimulation ) were divided into ten slices each for gel - enhanced liquid chromatography – mass spectrometry ( GeLC – MS ) and excised from the gel and subjected to in - gel reduction and alkylation , followed by trypsin digestion as previously described 33 . Peptides were extracted twice by adding an equal volume of 30 % acetonitrile / 0 . 3 % triﬂuoroacetic acid ( TFA ) in water to the digest mixture followed by a ﬁnal extraction with 100 % acetonitrile . Extracts were dried in a Speedvac to remove organic solvent and subsequently acidiﬁed to 0 . 5 % TFA . Samples were desalted and concentrated with STAGE tips 34 and resuspended in 5 m l of 0 . 5 % acetic acid / 0 . 02 % heptaﬂuorobutyric acid for sample injection . For the western blotting experiments , 1 (cid:1) 10 7 HeLa cells per condition were used . The cells were grown , serum - starved and EGF - treated essentially the same way as described above for the large scale experiment . Brieﬂy , the cells were starved for 16 h and then left untreated or treated with the growth factor for 1 , 5 , 10 and 20 min , respectively . Subsequently , the cells were scraped in a lysis buffer and the cleared lysates incubated with agarose - conjugated 4G10 antibody for 6 h . After the initial 2 h of incubation , anti - phosphotyrosine P - Tyr - 100 was added to the immunoprecipitations . After three washes with lysis buffer , immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved on SDS - PAGE . After transfer , the nitrocellulose membrane was blocked with 2 % BSA and then incubated with the corresponding antibodies , followed by HRP - conjugated secondary antibodies ( Fig . 2 ) . The membranes were subjected to chemiluminescent detection according to manufacturer’s instruc - tions ( ECL , Amersham ) . In the case of p44 / 42 and p38 MAP kinases , the western blotting was performed directly on the lysates using phospho - speciﬁc antibodies . Mass spectrometry and data analysis . Mass spectrometric analyses were done with nanoscale LC - mass spectrometry ( LC - MS ) and LC - tandem mass spectro - metry and a quadrupole time - of - ﬂight instrument ( QSTAR - Pulsar , ABI - MDS - SCIEX ) with sample introduction with a 96 - well autosampler ( Agilent HP1100 ) . The column was a self - packed , 10 - cm long 8 - m m tip opening / 100 m m ID capillary needle ( Picotip , New Objective ) packed with Vydac 218MSB3 bulk material ( 3 m m prototype reversed phase material , a gift from Grace - Vydac ) . The chromatographic separation was done with a linear gradient elution from 95 % buffer A ( H 2 O / acetic acid , 100 : 0 . 5 vol / vol ) to 50 % buffer B ( H 2 O / acetonitrile / acetic acid , 20 : 80 : 0 . 5 vol / vol ) in 80 min . Data ﬁles of completed LC - MS runs were converted to Mascot generic format ﬂat ﬁles by the Mascot . dll script supplied with Analyst QS software ( MDS - Sciex ) . The Mascot software package ( Matrix Science London ) was used for database search and protein identiﬁcation with IPI human protein database . Both peptide mass tolerance and fragment mass tolerances were set at 0 . 2 Da for an initial search . An iterative calibration algorithm based on Mascot protein identiﬁcations was applied to the raw Analyst data ﬁle and gave mass accuracies within 20 p . p . m . All protein identiﬁcations were based on at least two matching peptides and the tandem mass spectra were additionally validated manually . Arginine - containing peptides were extracted from the search results . Their retention times were used to locate the peptides in the raw mass spectral ﬁles CL with the help of an in - house software program capable of calling Analyst functions . ( The program is available as ‘open - source’ at http : / / www . sourceforge . net / under the name MSQuant . ) The program then identiﬁed the eluting peptide peak and determined the peak areas of peptide triplets for each single scan mass spectrum . This data were collated and veriﬁed manually for each arginine peptide cluster for each protein . Each arginine peptide yielded two ratios expressed as the peak area of Arg - 6 divided by the peak area of Arg - 0 , and Arg - 10 divided by Arg - 0 . Averaging these peptide ratios for the different arginine peptides sequenced yielded the ratios shown in Table 1 , for two of the four ratios . The other two ratios were obtained in the same way from the second set of experiments , using a common zero point and two additional durations of stimulation as described above . The typical quantiﬁcation error arising from 13 C - subtituted SILAC quanti - ﬁcation methods were better than 10 % relative standard deviation ( RSD ) for an individual peptide 12 . We separately assessed the quantiﬁcation variability between different peptides of a protein , which also resulted in a variability well within 20 % RSD . However , we observe that activation ratios 4 25 show higher variability ( as high as 30 % RSD ) because of small peak areas of the Arg - 0 peak 12 . In these cases , the ratio of signal - to - noise is much greater for the Arg - 0 peak as a percentage of the total peak area and the observed ratio is generally an underestimation of the true ratio . Because all points are normalized to the common zero time point , this error would contribute to all peptides by the same factor while leaving the curve shape unaffected . This is graphically illustrated in Supplementary Figure 1 online . The typical quantiﬁcation errors from mass spectrometric quantiﬁcation of 20 % RSD were smaller than the selected , conservative threshold of 1 . 5 - fold chosen for biological signiﬁcance . This cutoff yielded virtually the entire known EGF tyrosine phosphoproteome . The entire experiment was performed in an independent , three - time - point experiment on a smaller scale , which yielded reproducible activation proﬁles for all the proteins quantiﬁed . Activation curves were generated from protein ratios in Table 1 by plotting interpolated curves with KaleidaGraph ( Synergy Software ) using the Stineman function . The peak in activation proﬁles as described in the text is the maximum of this plotted curve . Note : Supplementary information is available on the Nature Biotechnology website .
