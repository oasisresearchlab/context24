The American Journal of GASTROENTEROLOGY VOLUME 107 | MAY 2012 www . amjgastro . com ORIGINAL CONTRIBUTIONS nature publishing group 736 F UN C T I O N A L G I D I S ORD E R S INTRODUCTION Th ere is convincing epidemiological evidence to support the rela - tion between psychosocial determinants ( 1 – 3 ) , gastrointestinal infections ( 4 ) , and the onset , persistence , and severity of irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) manifestations . However , a pathophysio - logical connection has not been elucidated . Our general hypo - thesis is that a leading event in IBS pathogenesis is the breakdown of intestinal epithelial barrier ’ s surveillance .

The objective of this study was to determine the molecular events and mechanisms and the clinical role of upper small intestinal alterations . METHODS : Clinical assessment and a jejunal biopsy was obtained in IBS - D patients and healthy subjects . Routine histology and immunohistochemistry was performed in all participants to assess the number of mast cells ( MCs ) and intraepithelial lymphocytes . RNA in tissue samples was isolated to identify genes showing consistent differential expression by microarray analysis followed by pathway and network analysis in order to identify the biological functions of the differentially expressed genes in IBS - D . Gene and protein expression of tight junction ( TJ ) components was also assessed by quantitative real - time polymerase chain reaction and confocal microscopy to evaluate the pathways identiﬁ ed by gene expression analysis . RESULTS : The analysis reveals a strong association between the transcript signature of the jejunal mucosa of IBS - D and intestinal permeability , MC biology , and TJ signaling . The expression of zonula occludens 1 ( ZO - 1 ) was reduced in IBS - D at both gene and protein level , with protein redistribution from the TJ to the cytoplasm . Remarkably , our analysis disclosed signiﬁ cant correlation between ZO proteins , MC activation , and clinical symptoms . CONCLUSIONS : IBS - D manifestations are linked to molecular alterations involving MC - related dysregulation of TJ functioning in the jejunal mucosa .

Barrier dysfunction might facilitate unfettered penetration of food and bacterial antigens , stimulating disruptive immuno - logical responses and the development of mucosal infl ammation ( 11 , 12 ) . Interestingly , both stress and infections display signifi - cant ability to disturb the mucosal barrier and to initiate and / or reactivate mucosal infl ammation in animal models and humans ( 9 , 10 , 13 – 15 ) . Additional support to this hypothesis comes from several reports showing the presence of low - grade infl ammation and immune activation as a frequent , yet not universal ( 16 , 17 ) , pathological hallmark in the intestinal mucosa of certain IBS sub - groups ( 18 , 19 ) . In this context , activated mast cells ( MCs ) in both the small bowel and the colon ( 20 – 22 ) may play a key role . Upon activation , MCs release a variety of potent biological mediators , some of which have been implicated in the regulation of the intes - tinal barrier function and in the generation of gastrointestinal motor abnormalities and visceral pain in IBS ( 16 , 23 , 24 ) . Although clinical studies have shown that increased intestinal permeability occur along the whole intestine , studies aimed at unraveling the molecular underpinnings of this abnormality in IBS are focused on the large bowel . In this sense , recent reports have shown that barrier dysfunction in IBS is linked to the down - regulation of the tight junction ( TJ ) scaff olding protein zonula occludens 1 ( ZO - 1 ) ( 9 ) and to the degradation of the TJ structural protein occludin by the proteasome in the colonic mucosa ( 10 ) . Recent microarray analysis in colonic biopsies of IBS patients describe signifi cant changes in the expression and secretion of selected pro - infl ammatory cytokines and the impairment of mucosal immune response to microbial pathogens ( 25 , 26 ) . Sev - eral lines of evidence suggest that the small bowel may be the area of origin of IBS symptoms . Hence , in contrast to previous stud - ies , we focused our eff ort on the small bowel . Furthermore , we applied a new strategy supplementing the information provided by microarray analysis with the identifi cation of biological func - tions by canonical signaling pathway analysis and regulatory net - work identifi cation . Since these studies indicated that TJ signaling and MC biology are the most altered pathways , we further studied the expression of TJ proteins and MC activation by quantitative real - time polymerase chain reaction ( Q - RT – PCR ) and immuno - fl uorescence . Finally , to validate and consolidate the information provided by these other techniques ; we investigated the potential clinical relevance of these molecular fi ndings analyzing their cor - relation with the clinical manifestations of IBS - D . METHODS ( See also Supplementary Methods section ) . Participants Twenty - fi ve newly diagnosed patients with daily watery diarrhea or mushy stools meeting the Rome II IBS - D criteria ( 27 ) and 23 healthy subjects , aged ≥ 18 and ≤ 60 years , were prospectively recruited from the gastroenterology outpatient ’ s clinic and by public advertising , respectively . A complete medical history and physical examination were carried out . Food allergy was excluded using a battery of skin prick tests ( Leti SA , Barcelona , Spain ) for 32 common food allergens in all candidates . Reasonable exclusion of past episodes of infectious gastroenteritis and gastrointestinal comorbidities was achieved by means of a broad biochemical and serological profi le including anti - transglutaminase antibodies , upper and lower fi beroptic and small bowel capsule endoscopy , abdominal sonography , and barium studies , when considered per - tinent . Th e study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee at Hospital Vall d ’ Hebron [ PR ( AG ) 76 / 2006 ] . Written informed consent was obtained from each participant . Experimental design and rationale Clinical assessment and a jejunal biopsy was obtained in all partici - pants . Routine histology and immunohistochemistry to assess the number of MCs and intraepithelial lymphocytes was performed in all participants . Th e following analyses were also performed in ran - domly selected subgroups of IBS - D patients and healthy subjects ( see also Statistical analysis below and Supplementary Table 1 ) : a . RNA in tissue samples was isolated to identify genes show - ing consistent diff erential expression by microarray analysis ( fi ve IBS - D patients and fi ve healthy subjects ) . Pathway and network analysis was then applied in order to identify the biological functions of the diff erentially expressed genes in IBS - D . b . Gene expression was also evaluated by Q - RT – PCR analysis in order to validate by a more sensitive method the results previ - ously obtained by microarray and pathway analysis in a larger population ( 17 IBS - D patients and 12 healthy subjects ) . c . To evaluate the pathways identifi ed by gene expression analysis , protein expression and distribution of ZO - 1 , ZO - 2 , and ZO - 3 was assessed by immunofl uorescence ( 16 IBS - D patients and 15 healthy subjects , of them eight IBS - D patients and four healthy subjects underwent both mRNA expression and immunofl uorescence analysis ) . Clinical assessment Th e following parameters were recorded : ( i ) background stress by the Modifi ed Social Readjustment Scale of Holmes – Rahe ( 28 ) ; ( ii ) severity of abdominal pain by a 100 - point visual analog scale during the last 10 days ; ( iii ) frequency of abdominal pain ( number of days with pain ) during the last 10 days ; ( iv ) stool fre - quency ( maximum number of bowel movements ) ; and ( v ) stool consistency assessed by the BSFS ( Bristol stool form score ) ( 29 ) ( in each subject , the BSFS was daily averaged , if more than one bowel movement , and the grand mean over the 10 - day period was calculated ) . Jejunal biopsy A single mucosal biopsy per participant was obtained from the proximal jejunum , 5 cm distal to the Treitz ’ s angle , using a Watson ’ s capsule . Tissue samples were immediately split into two similar pieces with a sterile scalpel . One fragment was fi xed in formalin and embedded in paraffi n for further microscopic examination The American Journal of GASTROENTEROLOGY VOLUME 107 | MAY 2012 www . amjgastro . com 738 F UN C T I O N A L G I D I S ORD E R S Mart í nez et al . ( histology , inmunohistochemistry , and immunofl uorescence ) . Th e other fragment was placed in RNAse - free tubes containing 500 μ l of RNA Later Solution ( Ambion , Madrid , Spain ) and stored at − 80 ° C until processed for RNA isolation , microarray analysis and / or Q - RT – PCR ( see Experimental design above ) . Analytical procedures Histology and immunohistochemistry . Tissue sections were processed for routine hematoxylin and eosin following general procedures to assess epithelial morphology and eosinophilic infi ltration . In addition , the number of MCs and intraepithelial lymphocytes was determined at × 400 magnifi cation using anti - human c - kit ( CD117 ) and CD3 antibodies ( Dako , Barcelona , Spain ) , as previously described ( 21 ) . Specimens were blindly examined by one experienced pathologist . Immunofl uorescence . Sections were blocked with Blocking Solution ( Dako ) for 10 min followed by 60 min room temperature incubation in mouse anti - human ZO - 1 and ZO - 2 monoclonal anti bodies ( Invitrogen , Madrid , Spain ) or rabbit anti - human ZO - 3 monoclonal antibody ( Cell Signaling Technologies , Danvers , MA ) . Secondary antibodies were Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti - rabbit IgG and 488 goat anti - mouse IgG ( Molecular Probes , Madrid , Spain ) . Nuclei were counterstained with 4 ′ , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole . Negative control slides were set by exposing the serial sections under similar conditions but without the primary antibody . Fading was controlled using the Prolong anti - fade mounting media ( Molecular Probes ) and all sections were examined on the same day to avoid fl uctuations in fl uorescence signal due to photobleaching of probes . Images were acquired at 1 , 024 × 1 , 024 resolution with a laser scanning confocal microscope ( FV - 10 ) ( Olympus , Barcelona , Spain ) at a scan speed of 2 μ s / pixel and Kalman averaging for noise reduction . Th e exposure time , gain , and off set were set in the nega - tive control slide , adjusted to use the full dynamic range of the de - tectors and kept constant between all samples . Quantifi cation of TJ protein expression was performed in a blinded manner measuring the average of fl uorescence intensity in 10 non - overlapping fi elds per subject and background corrected using the negative control as the background image using the FV - 10 - ASW Olympus soft ware ( Olympus , Barcelona , Spain ) . Microarray analysis . RNA in tissue samples was isolated to iden - tify genes showing consistent diff erential expression by micro array analysis , following standard procedures . Th e detailed protocol is described in the Supplementary Methods section . To identify the underlying diff erential profi le in gene expression , we applied hier - archical clustering on the complete set of diff erentially expressed genes using average linkage and correlation as measures of simi - larity . Genes with similar expression profi les across the subjects were grouped together ( y axis ) in a hierarchical way . Th e com - plete data set is available at the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus ( http : / / www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / geo ; accession number GSE14841 ) . Quantitative real - time PCR . Amplifi cation of cDNA was used to further validate microarray results and to evaluate the biological functions and pathways related to the diff erentially expressed genes identifi ed by microarray analysis ( tryptase , stem cell factor ( SCF ) , TRAIL , TRAIL - R1 , PTEN ( phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten ) , ZO - 1 , ZO - 2 , and ZO - 3 ) . cDNA synthesis was performed using 1 μ g of total RNA with the High Capacity Reverse Transcription Reagents Kit ( Applied Biosystems , Madrid , Spain ) . Q - RT – PCR was performed on an ABI PRISM 7500 FAST Sequence Detection System ( Applied Biosystems , Madrid , Spain ) using validated TaqMan Gene Expression Assays ( GEA ) , and the human 18S subunit ribosomal RNA gene as the endo genous control ( Applied Biosystems ) . Each sample , including distilled water as negative control , was run in triplicate and data were analyzed by the 2 − Δ Δ Ct method , as previously described ( 30 ) . Th e expression of each gene was normalized to the endogenous control and the fold - change was calculated individually respect to the average of the healthy group . Statistical analysis Data are expressed as median ( range ) or mean ± s . d . , unless otherwise stated ; P values of < 0 . 05 were considered signifi cant . To deal with the multiple testing issues derived from the fact that many tests are performed simultaneously , P values were adjusted to obtain strong control over the “ false discovery rate ” using the Benjamini and Hochberg method ( 31 ) . Two - tailed parametric or non - parametric tests were used when appropriate ( unpaired Student ’ s t - test or Mann – Whitney U - test ) using GraphPad Prism 5 . 0 soft ware ( La Jolla , CA ) . In order to emphasize the existence of diff erential expression when suggested by a small adjusted P value , we have calculated the number of IBS patients “ out of the normal range , ” which we have defi ned by the 95 % confi dence interval for the mean expression in the healthy group . In a descriptive manner , it shows the proportion of non - overlapped patients ( IBS patients “ out of normal range ” ) . Two - way analysis of variance was performed to assess the poten - tial infl uence of gender on gene expression in IBS - D patients and healthy subjects . Randomization of patients ( microarray study ) and genes ( validation of microarray data ) was performed using a standard random number generator : a linear congruential generator was used to generate uni - form random values , followed by a transformation to obtain integer values in a set with the same size as the number of patients / genes . Pathway analysis . Pathway and network analysis was performed by the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis ( IPA ) methodology ( IPA Soft - ware 7 . 0 , Ingenuity Systems ; http : / / www . ingenuity . com ) . IPA integrates gene expression data obtained by microarray analysis with all the biological information available at public databases of scientifi c literature to predict the functional linkages ( biological functions and signaling pathways ) of these genes and their inter - pretation in the context of protein networks . Only genes with a mean fold - change of ≤ 0 . 7 and ≥ 1 . 4 , compared with healthy indi - viduals were analyzed by IPA . For network analysis , IPA provided a score according to the fi t of supplied genes and the list of bio - logical functions involved . Detailed explanation of IPA methods is included in the Supplementary Methods section . © 2012 by the American College of Gastroenterology The American Journal of GASTROENTEROLOGY 739 F UN C T I O N A L G I D I S ORD E R S Gene Signature of the Jejunal Mucosa of IBS - D Correlation of clinical and biological parameters . To get further insight of the biological relevance of our fi ndings , relationships between clinical variables and the expression of individual genes were assessed by Spearman ’ s ρ correlation . RESULTS Study population No signifi cant diff erences in age were detected between IBS - D patients and healthy subjects ( P = 0 . 16 ) . In the Holmes – Rahe scale , IBS - D patients showed moderate stress levels , signifi - cantly higher than healthy subjects scoring low levels ( Table 1 ) . Other demographic and clinical characteristics of the par - ticipants are shown in Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1 . Th e subjects selected for each analysis performed in this study are detailed in Supplementary Table 1 . Th e clinical characteristics of the patients selected for the diff erent analyses ( age , stress level , abdominal pain , and stool consistency ) did not diff er from the remainder ( P > 0 . 05 for all ) . The jejunum of IBS - D shows hyperplasia of mucosal MCs All biopsies disclosed normal epithelial architecture , no increase in eosinophil counts , and no parasites , microbial , or viral inclusions . Patients showed a marked increased in MCs ( CD117 + ) counts ( Table 1 ; Supplementary Table 2 ) . The jejunal mucosa of IBS - D shows a distinctive transcriptional proﬁ le linked to alterations in intestinal permeability , MC function , and TJ signaling Analysis of microarray data revealed 286 genes diff erentially expressed in IBS - D patients compared with healthy subjects ( false discovery rate - adjusted P value < 0 . 05 ) . Th e majority of the diff er - ences was low to moderate ( range : 0 . 3 – 0 . 7 for down - regulated genes and 1 . 4 – 2 . 8 for up - regulated genes ; Figure 1a ) . Visualization by hier - archical clustering of the individual signal intensities showed a simi - lar pattern of gene expression among IBS - D patients ( Figure 1a ) . To validate our microarray analysis , we selected 14 genes and analyzed their expression levels by Q - RT – PCR . Th e expression diff erences in IBS - D compared with healthy subjects was similar by both tech - niques in all 14 genes analyzed ( Supplementary Figure 1 ) . To defi ne how individual genes interact and have a coordi - nated role in specifi c biological functions and signaling pathways , we identifi ed the potential networks of the IBS - D transcriptomic profi le . Out of 286 diff erentially expressed genes , 268 were iden - tifi ed by IPA as eligible for network analysis due to the interac - tion among them and with other related genes based on the IPA knowledge base . IPA identifi ed 17 signifi cant biological networks and their most signifi cant biological functions ( Supplementary Table 3 ) . Th e genes in the highest scored network ( score 44 , 26 genes ) were related to intestinal permeability ( P < 0 . 01 ) , apopto - sis of leukocytes and MCs ( P < 0 . 01 ) , and immunological disor - der ( P < 0 . 05 ) . Th e main canonical signaling pathways linked to this network were phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 ( PTEN ) ( P = 0 . 006 ) and TJ signaling ( P = 0 . 001 ) ( Figure 1b ) . Th e expression of genes related to the functions and pathways identifi ed in this network was also analyzed by Q - RT – PCR in a larger IBS - D population ( n = 17 ) ( Figure 1c ) to confi rm the data obtained by microarray and IPA analysis . Among genes related to alterations in intestinal permeability induced by MCs , tryp - tase ( TPSAB1 / TPSB2 ) showed consistent up - regulation in IBS - D patients ( P = 0 . 0007 ) ( with 82 % of patients out of the normal range ; Supplementary Table 4 ) , without alterations in protease - activated receptor 2 expression in epithelial cells among others . In addi - tion , genes related to apoptosis and survival of MCs , including FOXO3 ( forkhead box O3 transcription factor ) , MCL - 1 ( myeloid cell leukemia - 1 ) , and SCF were down - regulated in IBS - D tissue samples ( P < 0 . 001 for all ) ; one or more of them was out of the normal range in 88 % of IBS - D patients ( Supplementary Table 4 ) . We found over - expression of the pro - apoptotic genes TRAIL ( P = 0 . 006 ) and TRAIL - R1 ( P = 0 . 02 ) ( at least one was out of the normal range in 76 % of IBS - D patients ; Supplementary Table 4 ) , without alterations in CASP10 . In 100 % of IBS - D patients , at least two of these apoptosis - related genes were out of the normal range ( Supplementary Table 4 ) . Moreover , we validated the signifi cant reduction in PTEN expression in IBS - D ( P < 0 . 0001 ) ( with 94 % of IBS - D patients showing abnormal expression ; Supplementary Table 4 ) , which may also link FOXO3 to MCs survival .

IBS - D samples showed diff erential mRNA expression of several IPA analysis also identifi ed a number of canonical signaling pathways key for intestinal homeostasis as playing an important role in IBS - D ( Table 2 ) .

Th ese proteins , together with ZO - 3 , are responsible for connecting the integral transmembrane proteins of the intercellular junctions to the cytoskeleton ( 32 ) . In order to further assess TJ dysregulation , we measured the expression and protein distribution of ZO proteins in a larger set of participants . Q - RT – PCR analysis demonstrated a signifi cant down - regulation of ZO - 1 and ZO - 3 mRNA in IBS - D patients ( P < 0 . 01 for both ) , while ZO - 2 remained unchanged ( Figure 2b ) . In 76 % of IBS - D patients , at least one of these TJ - related genes was out of the normal range ( Supplementary Table 4 ) . Immunofl uorescence analysis showed reduced staining for both , ZO - 1 ( P < 0 . 0001 ) and ZO - 2 ( P < 0 . 05 ) in IBS - D , and no change in ZO - 3 staining ( Figure 3 ) . Moreover , we observed a marked labeling of the intracellular compartment in IBS - D samples , suggesting intensive internalization of this protein , as opposed to healthy subjects where ZO - 1 was restricted to the surface of epithelial cells ( Figure 3 ) . Th e expression of ZO proteins signifi cantly correlated with tryp - tase and SCF , which are indicative of MC activation and prolifera - tion , respectively ( Table 3 ) .

DISCUSSION We provide the fi rst evidence of the alteration of TJ signaling in the jejunal mucosa of IBS - D patients and its relation to MC activation and to the clinical features of these patients . Con - jointly , these fi ndings come to challenge the classical view of IBS as a model functional disorder , while reinforce its organic parentage , which extends beyond the colon to aff ect also the small bowel . Stress , age , and gender have no effect on the expression of MC and TJ - related proteins in the jejunum of IBS - D No signifi cant diff erences in gene expression were found between healthy women and men ( Supplementary Table 5 ) . To further assess the potential infl uence of gender on gene expression , we compared the gene expression data including gender as a vari - able and did not fi nd signifi cant diff erences in any of the genes analyzed ( Supplementary Table 6 ) . Furthermore , the intensity of fl uorescence of ZO proteins was similar for men and women in both IBS - D and healthy subjects ( Figures 2b and 3 ) . We also analyzed the potential eff ect of age on histological vari - ables and gene expression and did not fi nd any signifi cant correla - tion ( Supplementary Table 7 ) .

Altered intestinal permeability has been described as a key feature of IBS ( 5 – 8 ) , being more pronounced in IBS - D patients ( 5 ) . Our study identifi ed the TJ signaling as one of the most signi fi cant pathways . Of particular clinical interest to IBS - D is the down - regulation of ZO - 1 , given its ability to modulate paracellular permeability , and its correlation with enhanced intestinal permeability ( 6 , 9 ) . In our study , both Q - RT – PCR and confocal microscopy confi rmed the down - regulation of ZO - 1 in the jejunum of IBS - D . In addition , we found ZO - 1 redistribu - tion from the apical membrane of the enterocytes to the cyto - plasm in IBS - D samples .

Th ese genes have been shown to participate in MC apoptosis ( 37 – 40 ) , but they are not specifi c and their expression may refl ect apoptosis of other immune or epithelial cells . Alternatively , increased expression of apoptotic genes might represent a sort of homeostatic response to the increase in MC numbers . Interpreting the functional consequences in microarray screen - ing is one of the major goals of this exploratory technique . In order to achieve this , IBS - D gene profi le was further analyzed with the IPA soft ware , which integrates all biological knowledge extracted from the recent scientifi c literature . Our microarray gene analysis yielded a list of 286 diff erentially expressed genes in IBS - D . Other gene expression studies performed in the colon yielded a list of 20 – 33 genes ( 25 , 26 ) , disparities that may respond to heterogene - ous IBS populations , to variations between gut segments ( i . e . , the diff erent antigenic load to which jejunal and colonic mucosa are exposed ) , and to the larger size and deeper penetration of suction vs . endoscopic biopsies . Nevertheless , the magnitude of the diff er - ences in gene expression ( < 2 - fold in 86 . 5 % of the genes ) was simi - lar to previous studies ( 25 , 26 ) . Th is diff erential gene expression is concordant with the low - grade infl ammation observed in IBS - D ( 19 , 22 , 41 – 43 ) . We acknowledge that the relatively small size of participants and the reduced number of samples examined for micro - array profi ling is a potential weakness of the study . How - ever , we attempted to counterbalance this limitation by the highly homogeneous group population included . Moreover , the validation of the data by Q - RT – PCR and further assess - ment of alterations in TJ signaling at both mRNA and protein level in a higher number of patients also reinforce our results . However , we wish to acknowledge that these analyses can - not be viewed completely as replications / validations because selection of markers to be studied subsequently by Q - RT – PCR and immunofl uorescence was based on microarray analysis has been found in mouse colonocytes added with fecal superna - tants from IBS - D ( 33 ) . Besides protein down - regulation , struc - tural and functional modulation of barrier function can be also achieved by endocytosis of TJ proteins by a mechanism that depends on the stimulus involved ( 34 ) . Pro - infl ammatory fac - tors such as tumor necrosis factor and bacterial products have been shown to induce the internalization of ZO - 1 and occludin by caveolar - mediated endocytosis ( 35 , 36 ) together with a con - comitant loss of barrier function . Notably , caveolar - mediated endocytosis is identifi ed in our study as the most signifi cant signaling pathway associated with the transcriptional signature of IBS - D . Taken together , these results suggest that ZO - 1 down - regulation and redistribution may help to explain the increased intestinal permeability observed in IBS - D , although further studies are needed to defi ne the mechanism and functional con - sequences of this alteration . Diff erences in expression in ZO - 2 and ZO - 3 may also contri - bute to intestinal barrier dysfunction in IBS - D patients . Th e lack of congruity between mRNA expression and immunofl uorescence staining of these proteins found in our study may be due in part to the diff erent groups of subjects undergoing the two analyses . Interestingly , the down - regulation of ZO proteins negatively correlated with activation of MCs and bowel dysfunction in these patients . Given that tryptase has been shown to trigger redistribu - tion of ZO - 1 increasing paracellular permeability in colonocytes ( 37 ) , it can be speculated that the clinical manifestations of IBS - D may rely on distinctive MC - related impairment of jejunal TJ func - tion . Furthermore , our study demonstrated increased jejunal tryp - tase expression in IBS - D , as previously shown in the colon ( 16 ) . Th us , this mechanism may be of critical importance in the control of infl ammation in the intestine . However , additional studies are needed in order to defi ne its role in the pathophysiology of IBS - D . Overall , our data support that IBS - D pathophysiology is par - tially determined by the mucosal imbalance of factors control - ling survival , proliferation , and activation of several immune cells , among which MCs may be playing an important role . We acknowledge the apparent confl ict between the increased number Table 4 .

Although there is substan - tial overlap in the expression of individual genes between IBS - D patients and healthy subjects , grouping genes by their biological function showed that a large proportion of patients were out of the normal range . In this study , we took a directed approach that allows us to build a coherent model to explain IBS symptoms . However , caution is advised when interpreting the translational relevance of our results to the clinical practice , as we acknowl - edge that correlation is not causation and there are other models that could be constructed to explain our observations . In conclusion , this study provides a meaningful insight of the pathogenesis of IBS - D , particularly on the complex network of molecular interactions regulating the jejunal barrier function and its relation to clinical manifestations . Although much remains to be learned , we may hypothesize that the integration of com - putational and high - throughput genomic resources will provide disease biomarkers and new targets for therapeutic intervention in IBS .
