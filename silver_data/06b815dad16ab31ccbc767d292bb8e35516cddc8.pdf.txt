For 9 example , a honeybee foraging for nectar must decide whether to continue exploiting the 10 current patch or move to a new location 3 - 6 . When the relative reward of options changes over 11 time , humans explore in a normatively correct fashion , exploring more often when they are 12 uncertain about the relative value of competing options 7 - 11 . However , rewards in these 13 laboratory studies were objective ( e . g . , monetary payoff ) , whereas many real - world decision 14 environments involve subjective evaluations of reward ( e . g . , satisfaction with food choice ) . 15 In such cases , rather than choices following preferences , preferences may follow choices with 16 subjective reward ( i . e . , value ) to maximize coherency between preferences and behaviour 17 12 , 13 . If so , increasing coherency would lessen the tendency to explore while uncertainty 18 increases , contrary to previous findings . To evaluate this possibility , we examined the 19 exploratory choices of more than 280 , 000 anonymized individuals in supermarkets over 20 several years . Consumers’ patterns of exploratory choice ran counter to normative models for 21 objective rewards 7 - 9 , 14 – the longer the exploitation streak for a product , the less likely were 22 people to explore an alternative . Furthermore , customers preferred coupons to explore 23 alternative products when they have recently started an exploitation streak . These findings 24 suggest interventions to promote healthy lifestyle choices . 25 26 Effective decision making requires balancing exploratory and exploitative behaviour 1 , 2 , 15 . 27 For example , finding a restaurant that bests one’s current favourite requires some exploration . 28 The timing of exploration is also critical . Normatively , the rate of exploration should increase 29 as uncertainty about the relative goodness of options increases 8 . For example , one may give 30 a restaurant a second chance after a year has passed because the service could have improved 31 in the interim . People in laboratory studies with objective rewards ( e . g . , money ) behave in a 32 manner consistent with the ideal actor 7 - 9 , 14 , exploring more often when uncertainty is high . 33 This efficient , systematic exploration appears to demand capacity - limited cognitive resources 34 9 and rely on frontal dopamine brain circuitry 14 , 15 . However , as in the restaurant example , 35 rewards can be subjective rather than objective . Although it’s clear that higher monetary 36 rewards are better , comparing the reward associated with two dining experiences is more 37 subjective and multidimensional ( e . g . , atmosphere , service , food quality ) . In such cases , 38 determining value becomes an interpretive exercise . This interpretive process can be self - 39 reinforcing such that people come to prefer what they happen to choose ( or believe they 40 chose ) 16 - 18 . For example , in a jam tasting task , the jam people initially disfavoured was 41 deceptively presented as the favoured option for a re - taste . Not only did people frequently fail 42 to detect the switch , but they also provided rich justifications for their “choice” 12 . In such 43 studies , people altered their preferences to align with their previous behaviour , which can 44 affect future choice 17 - 20 . Such coherence seeking behaviour is in line with people’s 45 preference for information that is consistent with their current views and behaviour 21 - 23 . 46 47 These coherency seeking tendencies in subjective choice have implications for exploratory 48 behaviour . Most choices , like those in a supermarket , involve subjective interpretation of 49 reward . If people alter their preferences to match their choices , then patterns of exploration 50 should be opposite of that found with objective monetary rewards . With objective rewards , 51 the likelihood of exploring increases the longer it has been since exploring ( see Fig . 1a ) . We 52 refer to this manner of exploration as uncertainty minimizing , as it responds to the possibility 53 of missing changes in the choice environment while exploiting preferred options . If instead 54 preferences conform to choices , then people should become less likely to explore the more 55 they exploit ( see Fig . 1b ) , which we refer to as coherency maximizing . In coherency 56 maximization , the longer people repetitively exploit an option , the more entrenched their 57 preference becomes . Such increased liking for chosen options strengthens coherence between 58 preference and past behaviour , while also promoting coherent future behaviour based on this 59 preference . Unlike common approaches to balancing exploration and exploitation in machine 60 learning 24 , both views predict that exploration is structured and non - random in that the 61 likelihood of exploring varies with recent choice history . Although these two views of 62 exploration differ in their predictions for local timing of exploratory choice , they both predict 63 the global exploration frequency should be stable over longer timescales . For example , under 64 coherency maximization , once one eventually explores and discovers a new choice to exploit , 65 the entrenchment process starts anew . In effect , the exploratory choice reduces the burden of 66 continuing to choose coherently to justify past choices , thereby resetting people’s preferences 67 to the level before the entrenchment started . This makes it possible to settle on a new choice 68 once the exploitation streak of a former choice has ended . 69 70 Whereas laboratory studies with objective rewards find uncertainty minimizing exploration , 71 we predict that coherency maximizing exploration will dominate with subjective rewards . To 72 test this hypothesis , we evaluated how people explore with subjective rewards by examining 73 shoppers’ behaviour in the supermarket . Tesco , a major UK supermarket chain , provided 74 approximately 283 , 000 fully anonymized datasets , each representing the purchases of a 75 shopper within a specific product category over a period of 250 weeks , involving 152 . 2 ( SD 76 = 89 . 9 ) store visits on average . We examined how individual shoppers explored product 77 options within six different product categories : beers , breads , coffees , toilet papers , washing 78 detergents and yogurts . For example , a shopper may prefer and exploit beer brand A for a 79 number of store visits before exploring brand B . Exploration and exploitation coding was 80 based on repetition - repeated choices ( i . e . , purchases ) were coded as exploitations whereas 81 explorations involved non - repetitive ( i . e . , switching ) choice ( see Methods for further details ) . 82 83 On average , people explored with a relative frequency of . 404 and this global tendency to 84 explore was stable over time ( see Fig . 2a and 2b ) , mirroring the results in laboratory studies 85 using objective rewards 8 , 9 . Both uncertainty minimization and coherency maximization ( see 86 Fig . 1 ) anticipate this result while also predicting that local patterns of exploration should be 87 non - random . Indeed , people’s patterns of exploratory purchases were non - random , as 88 evidenced by exploitation streaks that were longer ( M = 8 . 56 , SD = 18 . 33 ) than expected in 89 92 . 8 % of cases by a permutation test ( see Supplementary Information ) . This result indicates 90 that people systematically explore when shopping . The key question is whether people’s local 91 exploration patterns are more akin to those predicted by uncertainty minimization ( Fig . 1a ) or 92 coherency maximization ( Fig . 1b ) . As predicted and consistent with coherency maximizing 93 view , shoppers were less likely to explore the longer they had been exploiting a product ( see 94 Fig . 2c and 2d ) . This result is in stark contrast to studies with objective rewards that find 95 uncertainty minimizing exploration . 96 97 Model - based analyses , which treat exploitation streak length as a continuous predictor of 98 exploration rate , corroborated the conclusion that people are coherency maximizers . Choices 99 were modelled with logistic regression to predict the probability of exploration given the 100 current exploitation streak length ( see Fig . 3a ) . The results showed that the impact of 101 exploitation streak length on probability to explore was negative for 79 . 3 % of the shopper 102 datasets , implying that people explored less the longer they have been exploiting . A 103 permutation test for all regression slopes revealed that 82 . 6 % were lower than expected ( see 104 Fig . 3b ) . The findings suggest non - random exploration in line with the predictions for 105 subjective outcomes and coherency maximization . 106 107 In other domains , exploratory behaviour is viewed as a stable characteristic of individuals 108 and groups . For example , individuals’ strategies tend to agree across internal ( e . g . , memory 109 retrieval ) and external ( e . g . , foraging ) search tasks 25 and exploratory behaviour has been 110 found to systematically vary with factors such as impulsivity , genotype , depressive 111 symptoms , and age 7 , 9 , 14 , 26 . Analogously , we consider whether people’s pattern of coherency 112 maximizing exploration is consistent at the individual level across different products . Using 113 the model - based estimates , we found that individuals’ patterns of coherency maximization 114 were consistent across the product categories considered . For example , for 20 . 3 % more 115 shoppers than expected by chance , either all or none of five product category datasets were 116 associated with strong coherency maximizing behaviour ( see Supplementary Information ) , 117 which is remarkable given the diversity of the product categories considered . 118 119 One controversial aspect of the coherency maximizing view is that preferences may follow 120 from choices . We assessed this possibility by examining consumer’s choices with coupon 121 offers . First , we analysed how customers reacted toward product coupons , where they 122 received points on a bonus card or price discounts for buying a promoted product . If people’s 123 preferences change with exploitation streak length , they should prefer coupons to exploit or 124 explore products differently at different stages ( i . e . lengths ) of their exploitation streaks . 125 Based on 69 , 664 coupon redemptions in our choice datasets ( see Fig . 4a ) , we observed that 126 customers redeemed coupons to explore products more quickly when they were on short 127 exploitation streaks ( M = 27 . 0 days ) compared to long ones ( M = 29 . 8 days ) . Conversely , 128 customers redeemed coupons to exploit more quickly on long exploitation streaks ( M = 24 . 4 129 days ) and slower on short streaks ( M = 25 . 7 days ) . This strong interaction is predicted by the 130 coherency maximization view . 131 132 Second , rather than relying on existing data , we conducted a follow - up coupon study in 133 which we issued coupons for instant coffee to 8 , 623 randomly selected households who 134 regularly buy instant coffees . A logistic regression model was fit to the group to predict 135 coupon redemption probability based on exploitation streak length . Consistent with the 136 previous coupon analysis and coherency maximizing exploration , the results revealed a 137 significant interaction of coupon type ( i . e . whether the coupon meant exploration or 138 exploitation to the customer ) and current exploitation streak length , | z | = 3 . 623 , p < . 001 ( see 139 Fig . 4b , details in Supplementary Information ) . Hence , we find support for the idea that 140 people’s choices induced preference changes , as their interest in coupon rewards depended on 141 how well the coupon matched their recent choices ( i . e . their exploitation streak length ) . 142 143 The overall pattern of results strongly indicates that shoppers are coherency maximizing 144 explorers , which is striking given that research with objective rewards ( e . g . , money ) finds the 145 opposite , uncertainty minimizing exploration 7 - 11 , 14 . One explanation is that subjective 146 rewards involve an evaluative process ( e . g . , satisfaction with food choice ) in which the 147 individual constructs value to justify the choice and maximize coherency 18 , 27 . Indeed , our 148 ability to a priori predict who would redeem a coupon relied on people ' s preferences being 149 shaped by recent behaviours . Effectively , preferences may follow choices , which might 150 appear irrational 28 but could be an effective strategy in some environments . For example , 151 preferring food sources that have been frequently and recently sampled could be an effective 152 means for avoiding foodborne illnesses . The same approach we utilized , linking big data with 153 psychological theory , could be leveraged to properly time interventions aimed at improving 154 diet and exercise regime . Given that we found individuals ' patterns of exploration were 155 consistent across diverse product categories , it may be possible to predict who would benefit 156 most from such interventions . One basic lesson from our research is that people periodically 157 enter periods of exploration with a predictable likelihood , creating a window of opportunity 158 to modify behaviour for better or worse . 159 References 160 1 Cohen , J .

This normatively correct pattern of non - random 251 exploratory behaviour , where people explore more as uncertainty about the relative goodness 252 of competing options increases , has been found in humans with objective rewards ( e . g . 253 monetary values ) . 254 b , 255 In contrast , coherency maximizing decision makers tend to explore less as the interval since 256 the last exploration increases . One possibility is that when outcomes require subjective 257 interpretation ( e . g . tasting food ) , decision makers change their preferences to match their 258 recent choices in order to increase coherency . We predict that this self - reinforcing pattern 259 will hold for supermarket shoppers . 260 Figure 2 261 262 263 Figure 2 : Exploration changes locally but not globally . 264 a , 265 A median split of each shopper’s purchases revealed that the overall rate of exploration was 266 stable over time . 267 b , 268 Likewise , the distribution of differences between the first and second half exploration rates 269 for each shopper showed no systematic variations over time . 270 c , 271 A median split of exploitation streaks by shopper revealed that , in line with the predictions 272 for coherency maximization , people were overall less likely to explore on their next purchase 273 when currently on a long run of exploitative choices . 274 d , 275 In line with panel c , most individuals showed a decline in probability to explore from 276 exploitation streaks shorter to those longer than their median streak . 277 Figure 3 278 279 280 Figure 3 : Predicting exploration from exploitation streak lengths . 281 a , 282 As shown , a coherency maximizing shopper is less likely to explore alternatives the longer 283 the exploitation streak , which is characterized by a negative slope in the logistic regression 284 model . In contrast , the slope would be positive under uncertainty minimization and flat for 285 random exploration . 286 b , 287 Consistent with coherency maximization , the slope of the fitted logistic regression model was 288 negative for the majority of individuals . For comparison , we permuted the order of each 289 individual’s purchases and fitted the model ( see Supplementary Information ) . Slopes were 290 more negative in the actual than in the permuted data , providing further support that people 291 are coherency maximizing . 292 Figure 4 293 294 295 Figure 4 : Coupon redemption depending on current exploitation streak length . 296 a , 297 Consistent with coherency maximization , customers redeemed coupons to exploit products 298 more quickly the longer they have been exploiting the product ( i . e . on long exploitation 299 streaks ) . Coupons to explore alternatives were used more quickly when customers were only 300 beginning to exploit ( i . e . on short exploitation streaks ) . Error bars represent standard errors . 301 b , 302 Model fits of the observed relationship between exploitation streak length and the probability 303 of coupon redemption are shown . A shopper was more likely to redeem a coupon to exploit 304 the longer the exploitation streak , whereas a coupon to explore was more likely to be 305 redeemed the more recently a shopper has explored . 306 Method 307 We analysed 282 , 972 anonymous datasets containing the chronologically ordered purchases 308 of individual supermarket customers at Tesco , a UK supermarket chain , regarding one of six 309 different product categories . Tesco provided access to these datasets in collaboration with 310 dunnhumby , a customer science company and subsidiary of Tesco ( see Data Availability 311 statement for requests ) . Customers’ product choices were recorded in a database every time 312 they checked out using a personalized bonus card . This data use was in accord with the card 313 agreement , which stipulated that anonymized shopping data would be used and shared 314 outside of Tesco . Individuals in this database can only be identified by an anonymous dataset 315 number , but not by any personal information . Thus , the analysed datasets only contained 316 purchase - related information ( e . g . quantities , prices , discounts , etc . ) , but no personal 317 information about the shopper . Our sample was restricted to people with at least 50 purchases 318 within a specific product category , which was necessary to model individual behaviour and to 319 select from loyal customers ( i . e . , for which we have good coverage of their purchases ) . We 320 did not select customers who never explored or who did over 75 % of the time . We coded 321 exploration and exploitation based on repetition , where repeated choices were coded as 322 exploitations and non - repetitions as explorations ( see Fig . 3a ) . 323 Data Availability 324 The datasets generated and analysed for the present study are available from dunnhumby , a 325 customer science company and subsidiary of Tesco , upon request : 326 data _ questions @ dunnhumby . com . 327 Further information about the data and analyses is available online at the Open Science 328 Framework : osf . io / e76wy . 329 Coherency Maximizing Exploration in the Supermarket Peter S .

E - mail : peter @ peterriefer . net Supplementary Information Customer datasets We gained access to the Clubcard bonus program of Tesco , a major UK supermarket chain . As Clubcard members , people receive points for their purchases at Tesco that can be transferred into store discounts and non - monetary rewards . Every time a customer shops at Tesco and uses the personalized Clubcard at the checkout , all purchased items and additional information , such as given discounts or redeemed coupons are recorded in a database . Individuals in this database can only be identified by an anonymous dataset number , but not by any personal information . We analysed anonymized datasets that only contained purchase - related information ( e . g . quantities , prices , discounts , etc . ) , but no personal information about the shopper . Thus , it was impossible to draw any connection between the analysed data and the shopper who carried out these purchases . The Clubcard database provides 250 weeks of purchase histories for approximately 1 . 55 million customers , which is a ten per - cent random sample of all Clubcard users . In order to capture a set of typical choices in the supermarket , we examined purchases within the product categories of beers , breads , coffees , toilet papers , washing detergents and yogurts . The range of every category was defined according to the retailer’s descriptions , which corresponds to the segmentation that people encounter in their stores . In order to assure a clearer differentiation between the choice options ( e . g . ignore package sizes and special editions ) , we differed products on the brand level . Our datasets included chronological individual purchases of customers within one of the six above - mentioned product categories . For some customers , we had multiple datasets from different categories available . We selected people with at least 50 purchases within a specific product category to gain sufficient data for individual analyses and also to retrieve customers that likely use their Clubcard with every store visit . Each product category contributed between 39 , 105 and 79 , 988 datasets , summing up to 318 , 294 in total . We coded exploration and exploitation based on repetition , where repeated choices were coded as exploitations and non - repetitions as explorations ( see Fig . 3a ) . After the coding , we removed about 3 . 5 % of the datasets , as subjects chose the same item on every single occasion . Furthermore , extreme cases of exploration proportions beyond . 75 were also excluded from all analyses ( 7 . 6 % of the datasets ) . Eventually , a total of 282 , 972 datasets remained for our analyses . The mean time between purchases was 14 . 57 days ( SD = 7 . 46 ) with breads on the low end at 8 . 57 days ( SD = 3 . 35 ) and washing detergent on the high end at 23 . 38 ( SD = 6 . 46 ) days . Of the available options in a product category , customers tried 8 . 22 ( SD = 5 . 84 ) different brands on average . This ranged from 4 . 59 ( SD = 2 . 05 ) options for washing detergents to 15 . 83 ( SD = 9 . 82 ) for beers . Coding of explorative and exploitative choices We identified choice options at the brand level , which subsumes minor differences in unit sizes ( e . g . the same product in a 0 . 5kg and 1 . 5kg package ) . In previous research , the classification of explorative and exploitative choices is often based on the numeric value of experienced rewards 1 - 3 . As there is no numeric choice outcome in our brand choice dataset , we focus on the individual’s decision between either staying or going – repeating a brand choice or breaking out of a repetitive habit 4 . This definition assumes that the brand people stay with at the moment is the one they currently perceive as the best choice . Our results proved robust to various definitions of exploratory choice . Thus , we coded customers’ repeated choice of a brand as exploitation . Non - repetitions were coded as explorations . For example , a choice sequence of A - A - B - A - A would be coded Exploit - Exploit - Explore - Explore - Exploit ( assuming the first choice is a repetition ) . In some cases ( less than 10 % ) , people chose multiple items from the same category within the same store visit . We coded these cases as explorations when at least one of the items was not purchased on the previous store visit . Permutation tests We used permutation tests to determine when results differed from chance . We created 100 permutations of the originally observed choice sequences for each choice dataset , which served as a null distribution . As a next step , we applied the coding of exploration and exploitation as described above to the original and the permuted datasets . All statistical analyses could hence be conducted with original and permuted datasets . Comparing the results of observed and permuted datasets could therefore be used to identify whether and how people’s actual choices differed from randomly ordered choices . The statistical values of every observed dataset ( e . g . exploration frequency ) were ranked in comparison with their permuted control ( i . e . , null ) datasets . Here , we captured whether the dataset showed a relatively low or high value compared to the control datasets . Table 1 displays the mean values of exploration frequency , exploitation streak length and exploration streak length for observed and permuted data . Further , the relative number of observed datasets with low values compared to their control is shown . For example , 7 . 2 % of shoppers have unusually short exploitation streaks compared to a permuted control . On the other hand , this means a vast majority of people has unusually long exploitation streaks . This suggests that the observed data is not randomly ordered and further , people go on longer exploitation streaks than one would expect if their choices were ordered randomly .

M = Mean . SD = Standard Deviation . Obs = Observed . Individual logistic regression models For each dataset , we modelled the probability of exploration for all choices in observed and permuted control data ( see previous paragraph ) using logistic regressions . A baseline model with intercept only ( one parameter ) attributed constant probability of exploration independent of recent choices . This baseline model was compared to a streak model that included an intercept and a slope linked to the current exploitation streak length ( two parameters ) . For each dataset , both models were fitted to all choices ( M = 114 . 0 choices , SD = 66 . 3 choices ) . The slope parameter in the streak model for the randomized control data shows a slight positive bias , due to the limited amount of data and the fact that the longest exploitation streak will definitely end , therefore causing f ( explore | exploitation streak length ) to inherently rise with streak length . In the observed data , 79 . 3 % of the slopes in the streak model are negative across all product categories . Compared to the permuted control data , 82 . 6 % of the datasets have unusually small or negative slope estimates . Table 2 lists these slope parameter estimates per category .

Means and standard deviations were calculated across all observed customer datasets in the respective categories . For the control datasets , the 100 slopes per customer dataset were first averaged and the mean and standard deviation of these averages across customer datasets are reported . Cross - category analysis Some customers were represented in multiple datasets that contained their shopping decisions in different product categories . In these cases , we tested whether customers showed similar behaviour across these categories . We yielded slope estimates from a logistic regression ( see previous paragraph ) for all datasets . Next , we examined how many individuals had unusually negative slopes , i . e . ranked in the lower fifth percentile ( slope ranked ≤ . 05 ) of the permuted control in either all or none of their choice datasets . Such individuals were labelled consistent in their exploratory behaviour . We focused on the lower fifth percentile of slopes as these individuals showed clear and strong coherency maximizing behaviour . In each category , this still applied to almost half of the people . In order to check for unexpected behavioural consistency across product categories we compared the number of observed consistent individuals with the expected frequencies from chance . We included individuals who were represented in three to five categories in our analysis to assure an appropriate number of constellations cases to analyse . From the observed frequencies , we obtained a maximum - likelihood estimate for the probability that a dataset yielded a slope estimate in the lower fifth percentile rank amongst its permuted versions . This probability was estimated separately for cases where three , four or five datasets were available . We then created an expected frequency distribution for the number of datasets with slopes ranked in the lower fifth percentile given the total number of datasets available ( i . e . either three , four or five ) and compared this to the observed distribution . Table 3 gives the probability estimates for datasets to yield slopes in the lower fifth percentile , given the total number of datasets and also the observed and expected distributions for datasets with such slopes .

Expected frequencies in brackets . Coupon analysis First , we analysed how quickly customers redeemed product coupons , which provided points on their bonus card or price discounts for buying a promoted product . Customers received these product coupons in their mail and could choose to redeem them when buying the promoted product within 60 days . In all our datasets , we found a total of 69 , 664 purchases that were associated with the use of a product coupon . From the view of coherency maximizing exploration , coupons to explore fit customers’ current behaviour better on short than on long exploitation streaks . Similarly , coupons to exploit a favourite fit better on long exploitation streaks than on short ones . Therefore , having exploited a product for a long time rather than just having started to exploit a new favourite , customers should be quicker to redeem a coupon for the exploited product . On the other hand , customers should be slower to redeem a coupon to explore a different product when they are currently on a long exploitation streak . This means on the other hand , that shoppers should redeem such an exploration coupon quicker when their exploitation streak is still short . We divided the exploitation streaks in each individual’s dataset into short and long streaks by a median split . For each observed coupon redemption , we noted whether at the time of reception the customer was on a short or long exploitation streak and whether the coupon product would mean exploration or exploitation for the next purchase . We observed that customers redeemed coupons to explore products more quickly when they were on short exploitation streaks ( M = 27 . 0 days ) compared to long ones ( M = 29 . 8 days ) . Conversely , customers redeemed coupons to exploit more quickly on long exploitation streaks ( M = 24 . 4 days ) and slower on short streaks ( M = 25 . 7 days ) . Based on the findings that we reported for the redemption times of coupons in the database , we mailed product coupons to randomly selected households in order to examine coupon redemption with respect to recent exploratory choices . We obtained 8 , 623 anonymized and randomly selected datasets from the instant coffees category where the customer made at least 50 purchases , independent of what was chosen . In the instant coffees category , people could choose between a maximum of 27 options of which five had a market share of at least 5 % ( including the target brand on our coupon ) . We made a priori predictions about how likely individuals would redeem a coupon for a certain instant coffee brand based on their recent choices . Then , we sent the 8 , 623 anonymous customer IDs to a mailing house so that they could be mailed a coupon offering of 100 bonus points if they bought a specific instant coffee brand , which was the same for all customers . Customers could redeem the coupon within three weeks after reception . We defined the coupon type for each customer individually . Coupons served customers to exploit if their last purchase before receiving the coupon was the coupon product . On the other hand , the coupon was identified as exploration coupon if the customer bought a different instant coffee brand with the most recent purchase . Table 4 summarizes a logistic regression with probability of coupon redemption as dependent variable . We used coupon type ( exploration or exploitation coupon ) and exploitation streak length at coupon reception , as well as the interaction of the two variables as predictors . The significant negative interaction term implies that redemption was less likely for exploration coupons on long exploitation streaks . Conversely , redemption was more likely for exploitation coupons the longer customers have already been exploiting . Regarding the odds ratios , we can see that for exploitation coupons , the chance of coupon redemption increases 1 . 012 times with every additional exploitative choice or 1 . 127 times every ten exploitations . On the other hand , redemption decreases by a factor of 1 . 035 for exploration coupons with every additional exploitative product purchase or , in other words , by 1 . 411 with every ten additional exploitations .
