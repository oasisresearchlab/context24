We identify differences in time - dependent morphology and strength of adherence of single breast cells that are likely related to their malignancy and metastatic potential ( MP ) . Speciﬁcally , we compare high and low MP breast cancer cells with benign cells as a con - trol on collagen - coated , polyacrylamide gels with Young’s modulus in the physiological range of 2 . 4 – 10 . 6 kPa . We observe that the evaluated metastatic breast cancer cells remainrounded , withsmallcontactarea , upto6 . 5hfollowing seeding . Incontrast , thebenigncellsspreadandbecomemore elongated on stiffer gels . We identify measurable differences in the two - dimensional , lateral , traction forces exerted by the cells , where the rounded , metastatic cells apply signiﬁcantly larger , traction forces , as compared to the benign cells , on gels stiffer than 2 . 4 kPa . The metastatic cell lines exhibited gel - stiffness - dependent differences in traction forces , strain energies , and morphologies during the initial stages of adhe - sion , which may relate to their MP or invasiveness .

Interactions between cancer cells and their microen - vironment , such as adhesion , regulate the combined bio - chemical and mechanical processes that facilitate metastatic invasion . This study is focused on the initial stages of cell adhesion prior to cell morphology stabilization , showing sig - niﬁcant differences between the evaluated metastatic - cancer and benign cell lines , as well as between the cells with varying metastatic potential . In the past few decades , the like - lihood for metastases has been indicated through changes in biological markers ( Sidransky 2002 ) , gene expression , and more recently through mechanical interactions between the cells and the cancer microenvironment ( Lelievre et al . 1998 ; Paszek and Weaver 2004 ) . However , there are still no deﬁnite procedures to determine the for metastatic potential ( MP ) of cells and predict the likelihood for metastasis and more so to forecast the target organ ( Kraning - Rush et al . 2012 ) , leading to grim prognoses for metastatic cancer patients . Typically , to deliver prognosis and decide on clinical procedures and treat - ments , oncologists rely on pathological reports and statistical history of a speciﬁc cancer type to determine the metastatic phenotype of a tumor ( Ravdin et al . 2001 ) . Recently , we and others have shown that highly metastatic breast cancer cells are softer both externally and internally , as compared to non - metastatic cancer and benign breast cells ( Guck et al . 2005 ; Cross et al . 2007 ; Gal and Weihs 2012 ) ; that relates to differences in cytoskeleton dynamics and internal struc - ture of the cells ( Mierke et al . 2010 ; Goldstein et al . 2013 ) . Remarkably , we also showed that the same metastatic cells are also adaptable and were able to modify their cytoskeleton and morphology ( Dvir et al . 2015 ) and apply strong mechani - 123 S . Massalha , D . Weihs cally invasive forces to their microenvironment ( Mierke et al . 2008 ; Kristal - Muscal et al . 2013 , 2015 ) . However , while these mechanical markers show great promise , they are not yet applicable as reliable tools to identify and classify cancer cells . Hence , determining the speciﬁc mechanical interac - tions of metastatic cancer cells with their microenvironment can lead to development of novel approaches to predict the likelihood for metastasis , as well as reveal mechanisms and stages of metastatic invasion . Mechanicalinteractionsofcancercellswiththeirmicroen - vironment have revealed differences between cells with varying MP , albeit by focusing on the migration of cells and the late stages of metastasis formation ( Kraning - Rush et al . 2012 ; Peschetola et al . 2013 ) . Recently , the mechanical inter - actions of single cancer cells with their microenvironment have been evaluated following stabilization of the adhesive interactions ( i . e . , 24 h after seeding ) and have been directly correlated with the cells’ invasiveness and its MP ( Zaman et al . 2006 ; Kristal - Muscal et al . 2013 ; Mak et al . 2013 ) . Speciﬁcally , the ability of cells to change shape , modify their internal structure ( cytoskeleton and nucleus ) , alter adhesion and migratory states is directly correlated with their abil - ity to invade surrounding tissue . Tumor initiation ( Vermolen et al . 2015 ) and invasion of metastatic cancer cells includes several stages combining mechanical and biochemical inter - actions . The focus of our work is on the initial stages of cell adhesion , which typically occur as cells migrate into new environments . For example , adhesion is an important stage of the transmigration of a cell through the endothelium of a blood vessel when extravasating into a potential , secondary tumor site ( Mierke et al . 2008 ) . Cell adhesion is a time - and environment - dependent pro - cessconsistingoftwomainstages : attachmentandspreading . Those are , respectively , mainly biochemical and a combi - nation of biochemical and biomechanical processes , part of a complex mechanobiology cascade . Biochemical sig - nals from the extracellular matrix allow cancer cells to respond to changes in their microenvironment ( Kumar and Weaver 2009 ) . Cell interactions with their environment occurs through adhesion receptors ( Bershadsky et al . 2003 ) , and focal adhesions ( Ingber 2008 ) by utilizing the cytoskele - ton networks . Following initial attachment by biochemical connections , coordinated processes including the membrane molecules and the dynamically active cytoskeleton can mod - ify cell structure and morphology to allow cell spreading and strengthening of cell - substrate connections ; the cytoskele - ton and especially its molecular motors facilitate dynamic remodeling and allow active transport and force generation within the cell . Although mechanical processes are critical in cell adhesion and invasion , cancer research has mostly been focused on the biochemistry of cell attachment and spread - ing ( Paszek et al . 2005 ) . Moreover , the mechanical processes that control cancer cell invasion , such as cell adhesion , cell migration , changes in the cell shape , and the generation of forces , are currently not well understood . Thus , the focus of the current work is on evaluating the mechanical interac - tions of cells , speciﬁcally during the early stages of adhesion , likely before cells reach a stable morphology . This can shed light on important stages in the metastasis process revealing potentially prognostic differences between cells with varying MP . From another perspective , it has been shown that the stiff - ness of the ECM and the cell microenvironment can have profound mechanical effects on the cell , such as changes in its morphology , motility , protein expression , and force gen - eration ( Lo et al . 2000 ; Discher et al . 2005 ; Yeung et al . 2005 ; Geiger and Yamada 2011 ) . Focusing on the latter , pre - vious studies showed that ﬁbroblasts and endothelial cells ( noncancerous ) develop a ﬂatter morphology on stiffer sub - strates ( > 3 kPa ) and that cells will preferentially migrate from a soft to a stiff substrate ( Discher et al . 2005 ; Yeung et al . 2005 ) . Those mechanical effects alter with different cell types , and their response to the microenvironment . Cells respond to substrate rigidity cues by exerting actomyosin contractility ( Ruppender et al . 2010 ) , through integrins , focal adhesions , and the cytoskeleton ( Rape et al . 2011 ) ; focal adhesion formation and actomyosin contractility are essen - tial for cell adhesion to substrates ( Pelham and Wang 1997 ) . Speciﬁcally for cancer cells , the substrate rigidity regulates invasiveness at the primary site ( Pelham and Wang 1997 ; Lo et al . 2000 ; Paszek et al . 2005 ; Levental et al . 2009 ) , thus understanding the role of cell – ECM interactions and how the stiffness of the microenvironment affects the mechani - cal behavior of the cells is crucial for cancer diagnosis and early determination of the metastatic potential of a single cancer cell . Cancer cells exhibit altered tensional homeosta - sis , as compared to normal , nonmalignant cells and are thus expected to differ in contractility and spreading . Mammary epithelial cells evaluated on soft substrates ( 0 . 2 – 10 kPa ) have shown higher contractility and larger cell spreading area than nonmalignant cells ( Butcher et al . 2009 ; Kraning - Rush et al . 2012 ) ; in those works , measurements were taken at extended times after stabilization of cell morphology , unlike the mea - surements performed in the current work . Here , we identify and evaluate differences in mechan - ical interactions of metastatic cells during the early onto stages of adherence , i . e . , attachment and initial spreading onto varying stiffness gels . Those early interactions ( up to 6 . 5 h following seeding ) are likely related to the MP of the cells . Speciﬁcally , we have measured the time - dependent , two - dimensional ( 2D ) , traction forces applied laterally at the gel surface ( Butler et al . 2002 ; Abuhattum et al . 2015 ) by breast cancer cells with different MP , as compared to a benign control , during adhesion to varying stiffness poly - acrylamide ( PAM ) gels ( Young’s moduli of 2 . 4 , 4 . 3 , 7 . 2 , 123 Metastatic breast cancer cells adhere strongly on varying stiffness substrates , initially . . . or 10 . 6 kPa ) , starting at 0 . 5 h and up to 6 . 5 h after seed - ing . We show that both high and low MP cells apply signif - icantly larger traction forces during adhesion as compared to the benign breast cells on all gels with Young’s modulus larger than 2 . 4 kPa ; on lower stiffness gels , traction forces applied by the cell lines were indistinguishable . Between the two evaluated metastatic cell lines , we observe gel - stiffness - dependent differences that may relate to their metastatic potential and the resulting invasiveness . Concurrently , the metastatic cancer cells remained mainly rounded , while benign cells became elongated with time , especially on the stiffest gels . These ﬁndings show a correlation between the MP of the adhering breast cancer cells and their small areas combined with the large mechanical forces applied by the cells , which is likely what facilitates their metastatic capa - bilities . 2 Materials and methods 2 . 1 Cell culture Human epithelial breast cancer cell lines with high metastatic potential , MDA - MB - 231 ( HTB - 26D , ATCC ) and low MP , MDA - MB - 468 ( HTB - 132 , ATTC , Manassas , VA ) were cul - tured in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium ( DMEM , Gibco - Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) ; the relative metastatic potential of the two cell types had previously been reported ( Cooney et al . 2011 ) . The medium was supplemented with : 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) , 1 % penicillin , 1 % L - Glutamine , and 1 % 1 mM Sodium pyruvate ( all from Biological Industries , Kibbutz Beit Haemek , Israel ) . The benign epithelial breast cell line MCF 10A ( CRL - 10317 , ATTC , Manassas , VA ) wasgrownin1 : 1ratioofDMEM : F - 12 media ( Biological Industries , Kibbutz Beit Haemek , Israel ) , supplemented with 5 % horse serum , 0 . 05 % Hydrocortisone 1 mg / ml , 0 . 01 % Cholera toxin , 0 . 1 % Insulin at 10 mg / ml ( all from Sigma - Aldrich , Rehovot , Israel ) , 1 % penicillin streptomycin , and 1 % L - Glutamine ( both from Biological Industries , Kibutz Beit Haemek , Israel ) . The media was ster - ileﬁltered ( 0 . 2 µ m pores ) , andthen0 . 01 % humanendothelial growth factor ( EGF , Peprotech Asia , Rocky Hill , NJ ) was added . All cell lines were cultured in a humidiﬁed incuba - tor at 37 ◦ C containing 5 % CO 2 and were used at passages 10 – 30 from stock . 2 . 2 Gel preparation Polyacrylamide ( PAM ) gels were prepared according to an established protocol ( Raupach et al . 2007 ; Kristal - Muscal et al . 2013 ; Dvir et al . 2015 ) , on a glass cover slip , No . 5 thick - ness , 30 mm diameter ( Menzel , Germany ) . The glass surface wasﬁrststerilizedusing0 . 1MNaOHandthenactivatedusing 3 - aminopropyltriethoxysilane ( APTS , both Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) and glutaraldehyde . Fluorescent beads , 2 µ m in diameter , were glued ( by drying ) on the glass , where the ﬁxed positions of the beads facilitate image dedrifting due to any mechanical drift with time . The PAM gels were formed by combining the monomers with distilled water according to the recipes provided in Online Resource 1 . Fluorescent , carboxylated 200 - nm diameter beads ( Invitro - gen , Carlsbad , CA ) were added to the monomer solution . Gelation was initiated with ammonium persulfate ( APS ) and catalyzed with the tertiary aliphatic amine N , N , N (cid:3) , N (cid:3) - tetramethylethylenediamine ( TEMED , both Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) . Solutions for gel preparation were kept at 4 ◦ C and were mixed on ice to reduce the polymerization rate . Gels were prepared within a plastic frame ( GeneFrame , 25 µ l , 10 × 10 mm , ABgene Thermo - Scientiﬁc , Waltham , MA ) stuck on the glass coverslip and covered with a ﬂexible , plastic coverslip ; gels were closed as oxygen inhibits poly - merization . Gelation was performed while cooling to 2 ◦ C and centrifuging for 30 min at 300 g , to bring the beads to the gel surface ( Raupach et al . 2007 ) and were left upside - down at room temperature for 2 h ; the polymerization time was determined by rheology . Following polymerization , the gels were rinsed with HEPES pH 8 . 5 ( Sigma , St Louis , MO ) and kept in phosphate buffered saline . For this study , we used four substrates with different Young’s moduli varying between 2 and 11 kPa ( See Online Resource 1 ) , within the physiological range of soft tissue stiffness ( Levental et al . 2007 ) . After full polymerization , the plastic coverslip is removed and the gel surface is activated with sulfo - SANPAH ( Ornat , Israel ) by UV light exposure , twice for 10 min each . After UV expo - sure , the gels are rinsed with HEPES for 15 min on a shaker , and this process is repeated twice . To allow cell adherence , the cells were coated with collagen solution ( Rat tail type 1 , Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) which is added to the gels and left for 24 h at 4 ◦ C . The collagen solution is replaced with PBS , and gels are kept at 4 ◦ C for 12 h . Prior to cell seeding , PBS is replaced with media and gels are kept in an incubator for 1 h before use . 2 . 3 Gel stiffness The Young’s modulus of the gel was determined using a TA Instruments AR - G2 rheometer ( New Castle , Delaware ) with a 20 mm diameter parallel plate ﬁxture . Gels were pre - pared on the rheometer plate , and the shear modulus ( G ∗ ) was measured during and after polymerization . Tempera - ture was maintained at 37 ◦ C throughout the measurement , to match the cell - experiment conditions . Sample evaporation and dehydration were minimized by placing water - droplets on the rheometer bottom - plate near the gel . Using strain and frequency sweeps , we determined that gels were elas - 123 S . Massalha , D . Weihs tic ( G (cid:3) > > G (cid:3)(cid:3) ) , and the Young’s moduli ( E ) were thus obtained through : E = 2 G (cid:3) ( 1 + ν ) where ν is the Poisson’s ratio with a value of 0 . 48 for PAM gels ( Boudou et al . 2009 ) . The Young’s modulus was varied between 2 and 11 kPa ( see Online Resource 1 and Online Resource 2 ) . The generated gels exhibit linear elastic responses up to at least 80 % strain ( not shown ) . 2 . 4 Sample preparation and image acquisition Cells were seeded on the gel at a concentration ( 30 , 000 cells in 2mL growth media ) that was optimized to image a single cell per ﬁeld - of - view ( FOV ) . Imaging was done using an Olympus IX81 inverted , epiﬂuorescence micro - scope with on - stage humidiﬁed incubator maintaining 37 ◦ C , 5 % CO 2 , and 90 % humidity , and using a 60 × / 0 . 7NA differential interference contrast ( DIC , Nomarsky Optics ) air - immersion objective . Images were acquired using an XR Mega - 10AWCL camera ( Stanford Photonics Inc . , Palo Alto , CA ) , at a ﬁnal magniﬁcation of 107 . 8 nm / pixel . The cells were imaged every 1 h starting from 0 . 5 h after seeding up till 6 . 5 h , at randomly selected FOVs where cells were observed at the shortest time . For each cell type and each gel stiff - ness , we evaluated 15 – 20 cells . Three images were acquired at each time point in each FOV : ( a ) DIC image of the cells on the gel , ( b ) ﬂuorescent image of the 200 - nm diameter particles embedded at the gel surface , and ( c ) a ﬂuorescent image of the 2 µ m diameter particles on the glass cover slip , under the gel . At the end of each experiment , the cells were removed using trypsin ( Solution C EDTA 0 . 02 % , Biological Industries , Kibutz Beit Haemek , Israel ) , and images of the undeformed gel were obtained for each FOV . 2 . 5 Traction force microscopy Bead displacements at the 2D gel surface were determined at each time point , relative to the undeformed gel following cell removal , and in - plane traction forces were calculated ( But - ler et al . 2002 ) ; traction force microscopy algorithms were kindly provided by Ramaswamy Krishnan , Harvard Univer - sity . Figure 1 schematically shows the ﬂow of the experiment and analysis procedures for calculating the displacement and stress maps . Brieﬂy , bead positions were cross - correlated between the ﬂuorescent images of the 200 - nm beads , with and without the cell , using a sliding window of 32 × 32 pixels ; the images were initially corrected for any local drift in the system using the positions of the large , ﬁxed beads . That provided the displacement map of the current FOV at the speciﬁc time point . Using the displacement ﬁeld and with the gel Young’s modulus ( i . e . , stiffness ) and its Poisson’s ratio , we calculated the traction forces . Traction forces were conﬁned to within the cell boundary only , and all forces outside the boundary were zeroed using an itera - tive Fourier transform calculation ; the cell boundaries were manually marked using custom codes in MATLAB 2012b ( MathWorks , Nattick , MA ) , assuming that forces are only applied at a cell’s location . We focus on the total traction force , which is the sum of the magnitudes ( nondirectional ) of the traction stresses vectors ( T ) applied over the entire cell area , A : F total = (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3) (cid:5) T ( (cid:5) r ) (cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3) d A . The total traction force is typically considered as the force applied at all focal adhe - sions , or the overall force production of the cell ( Abuhattum et al . 2015 ; Soine et al . 2015 ) . 2 . 6 Local force maxima analysis Biological variability causes each cell to apply a wide range of traction force and strain energy magnitudes at different times , and each cell exhibited a different time evolution ( Online Resource 3 ) . The adhesion is experimentally moni - tored ( imaged ) at discrete , predetermined time points . Hence , an approach to normalize the timescales of each cell within its experiment is required . We observe that each of the sin - gle cells applies increasing and decreasing forces , which for each cell occur at different times during the adhesion process . This is a result of the different dynamics of each cell , and thus averaging over all the cells provides only partial information , and in many cases will mask the single cell dynamics ; aver - aging is still appropriate in some cases and for some of the parameters . Thus , in cases of large changes with time we deﬁne the local maxima of the total forces applied by each cell , as demonstrated in Online Resource 4a ( Kristal - Muscal et al . 2013 ) . The local maxima of the total force indicate changes in cell - applied forces during interaction with the substrate . Online Resource 4b shows that the distribution of number of local force maxima during the experiment is inde - pendent of cell type . Thus , the number of force maxima is an independent parameter in our system , effectively providing a cell - normalized time ; the ﬁrst maximum always occurs at the shortest times , albeit different for each cell . 2 . 7 Cell morphology analysis To quantitatively evaluate the morphological changes of the cells during adhesion , we determine the cell area and perime - ter and then calculate the cells’ eccentricity and circularity ( Xiong et al . 2010 ; Ren et al . 2015 ) ; see Online Resource 5 . Using a custom MATLAB module , we have manually marked the cell edge locations on the DIC images , and using that we automatically calculated the cell area and perimeter . Cell circularity , a measure of the relative smoothness of the cell perimeter ( its 2D shape ) , is deﬁned by c = 4 π A / p 2 , where A and p are the cell area and perimeter , respectively . The circularity values are between 0 and 1 , where a circu - larity of 1 indicates a smooth edge , or cell boundary ( Online 123 Metastatic breast cancer cells adhere strongly on varying stiffness substrates , initially . . . Fig . 1 Traction force microscopy experiments . a Cells are seeded on a PAM gel ( top ) which has ﬂuorescent beads embedded in its surface ( bottom ) ; the orange line is the cell boundary . Cell is imaged every 1 h after seeding , and gel deformations due to cell - applied forces are identiﬁed through beads displacement . b The cell is removed from the gel with trypsin , providing the undeformed , relaxed gel , reference state . c The displacement map of the beads between the cell - deformed and relaxed gel is calculated for each time point ; d traction stress map is cal - culated from the displacement map by using the gels’ Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio . Scale bar is 20 µ m Resource 5 ) . Smaller values of the circularity indicate irreg - ular edges , e . g . , blebs , where in cells very low values may result from existence of many protrusions and lamellipodia . We have also determined the cell eccentricity , a measure of the relative elongation of the cells’ shape , by approximating the cell shape to an ellipse with the same second - moments . The eccentricity is then given by the ratio of the distance between the foci of the ellipse and its major axis length . The eccentricity ranges between 0 and 1 , respectively , indicating a circular shape or a line segment shape ; the eccentricity of a spindle - shaped cell will be lower than unity . 2 . 8 Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed to compare between the cell types on each gel stiffness . At all stiffness other than 2 . 4 kPa , differences in the cell lines were determined as signiﬁ - cant using a two - way ANOVA with a post hoc Tukey test or a corrected Tukey – Kramer test ; signiﬁcance was determined at least at force maxima 1 and 2 , and at number 3 only on the 10 . 6 kPa gels . Signiﬁcance was established with p < 0 . 05 , and all results are presented as mean ± SE of the mean . 3 Results We have identiﬁed differences in morphology and forces applied by metastatic and benign breast cells during cell adhesion to an elastic PAM gels with varying stiffness . We have monitored the time - dependent changes in the cell mor - phology and in the traction forces applied by the cells during the adhesion process . Cells were imaged every hour up to 6 . 5 h , and results for high and low MP breast cancer cell lines were compared and contrasted with the control , benign breast cells . We observe time - dependent changes in the morphologies of the adhering cells that differ depending on the metastatic potential of the cells . When seeded on gel with E = 10 . 6 ± 0 . 3 kPa and following initial ( biochemical ) attachment , all the cells are round and exhibit different time - dependent changes in their morphologies ( Fig . 2 ) . The area of the benign cells increases with time , as the cells spread out on the gel , while the metastatic cells’ areas remain unchanged ( Fig . 2b ) . We observe a slight difference between the two metastatic celllines , wherethehighMPcellscross - sectionsaretypically smallest . We have also calculated the eccentricity and circu - larity ( Fig . 2c ) of the cell area , which , respectively , indicate cell shape deviations from roundness and the smoothness of the cell’s perimeter . All the evaluated cell types exhibit simi - lar , high values of smoothness at their perimeters ( circularity close to unity ) , indicating few protrusions . As the benign cells increase their areas , their morphology becomes more elongated ( more eccentric ) . In contrast , the high and low MP cells’ areas remained unchanged on average , being mainly rounded throughout the experiment time , with the low MP cells being somewhat rounder and smoother . We also note the strain energy transmitted by the cells to the gels ( Fig . 2d ) . We observe higher strain energy and reduction with time for the 123 S . Massalha , D .

Low MP cells ( MDA - MB - 468 ) transiently change their morphology yet on average maintain a rounded shape . Benign breast cells ( MCF 10A ) spread out on the gel with time and become more elongated . Scale bar is 10 µ m . b The area of the benign cells increases with time , while the cancer cells maintain a nearly constant area with time . c Cell morphology shown through the eccentricity and circularity . The cell eccentricity increases as cells become elongated . In contrast , cellcircularity ( measureofsurfacesmoothness ) isconstantanditsvalue indicates nearly protrusion free cell - perimeters . The area and eccentric - ity of the high and low MP cancer cells are statistically different from benign cells ( p < 0 . 05 ) starting at , respectively , 2 . 5 and 4 . 5 h after seeding . d Strain energy applied by the cells reduces with time for the metastatic cells , yet remains constant and low for the benign cells . Error bars are standard errors metastatic cells , while the benign cells induce a constant and low strain energy . Gel stiffness affects the cell morphology differently for the metastatic and the benign cells . We initially focus on the last time point , 6 . 5 h after cell seeding , and observe that the high MP and the low MP cells remain mainly rounded on PAM gels , regardless the gel stiffness ( Fig . 3 ) . In con - trast , the benign cells are round on soft gels and are more elongated on stiffer gels ( E > 7 kPa ) . To evaluate the differ - ences in morphology , we have measured the cell areas and perimeters and have calculated the eccentricity and the cir - cularity . Figure 3b shows that both of the metastatic breast cancer cell lines maintain nearly constant and similar attach - ment area on the evaluated gels , yet both exhibit a small increase in their adhesion area on gels with mid - range stiff - ness , i . e . , Young’s moduli of 4 . 3 ± 0 . 3 and 7 . 2 ± 0 . 1 kPa . Moreover , both high and low MP cells maintain constant eccentricity of about 0 . 5 ( Fig . 3c ) , regardless of gel stiffness , representing the rounded shape . In contrast , we observe that the benign cells increase their attachment area with gel stiff - ness and become more elongated on gels with E > 7 kPa ; the eccentricity of the benign cells increases signiﬁcantly with the gel stiffness ( p < 0 . 05 ) , while the circularity or surface roughness is independent of the gel stiffness at this time ( not shown ) . The smaller , rounded metastatic cancer cells are able to apply signiﬁcantly larger traction forces to the gels than the larger area , spread out , benign cells ( Fig . 4 ) . We have mea - sured the traction forces applied by the cells on the gel during the adhesion process as a function of the time - equivalent , local force maxima ( see Sect . 2 . 6 ) . The evaluated cells ( 15 – 20 single cells of each type and on each gel stiffness ) exhibit a wide distribution of cell applied , time - dependent traction forces ( Online Resource 3 ) . Using the local force maxima approachtoeffectivelynormalizethedifferentdynamictime - scales of the single cells , we observe statistically signiﬁcant ( p < 0 . 05 ) variation between the forces applied by each cell type ( Fig . 4 ) ; similar trends are observed in the strain ener - 123 Metastatic breast cancer cells adhere strongly on varying stiffness substrates , initially . . . Fig . 3 Cell morphologies on 2 . 4 – 10 . 6 kPa PAM gels at t = 6 . 5 h after seeding . a Cell images and b areas indicate that high MP ( MDA - MB - 231 ) and low MP ( MDA - MB - 468 ) cells are mainly round on the gels . Benign ( MCF 10A ) cells are round on soft gels ( E < 7kPa ) and elon - gate on stiffer gels ( E > 7kPa ) . Scale bar is 10 µ m . c The eccentricity quantiﬁes changes in cell shape . Error bars are standard errors gies applied by the cells ( Online Resource 6 ) . We observe that the metastatic breast cancer cell lines consistently apply larger total traction force than the benign cells . Interestingly , although differences in morphology of the low and high MP cells are small , the forces applied by the cells differ sig - niﬁcantly . In addition , we observe that the low MP cells apply larger forces than high MP cells ( p < 0 . 05 ) during adhesion to some gels . We also note that the traction forces reduce at higher values of local maxima number ( i . e . , longer times ) for all cell types . This indicates that the total traction force amplitudes decrease with adhesion time , likely leading toward more stable morphologies and force distributions , as previously observed ( Kraning - Rush et al . 2012 ) . 4 Discussion The metastatic breast cancer cells exhibit inherently different time - and gel - stiffness - dependent , mechanical interactions during the early stages of adhesion , as compared to benign control . We show that the cancer cells remain rounded and apply large traction forces to the underlying elastic gels with E > 4 kPa . In contrast , the benign cells spread out on the gel , increased their contact area , and concurrently applied smaller forces , likely to maintain their adhesion . While remaining rounded , the metastatic cancer cells are able to apply signiﬁcantly larger traction forces to the gel as compared to the benign cells ( Fig . 4 ) ; those forces reduce 123 S . Massalha , D . Weihs Fig . 4 Average of peak , total traction force applied at local force maxima , correlated with time after seeding ; low numbers are short times . The force amplitudes on all gel stiffnesses decrease with time . Only cells that applied measurable forces during at least 5 time points out of the total of 7 experimental time points were included , and all cells exhibited 3 local force maxima during the experiment time . a The cells apply the same amplitude of forces on the soft gel ( 2 . 4 kPa ) . b , d Low MP cells apply larger forces than high MP and both apply more force than benign cells , c high MP cells apply the highest forces . Error bars are standard errors with time . Benign cells apply statistically smaller peak , total traction forces than the metastatic breast cancer cells , on all gels , except on the 2 . 4 ± 0 . 2kPa gels . On those lowest stiff - ness gels , all the cells ( benign and metastatic ) apply similar , small traction forces ( Fig . 3a ) that do not signiﬁcantly change with time ; we had previously observed that on those gels many cells attempt indentation utilizing a combination of lateral and normal forces ( Kristal - Muscal et al . 2013 ; Dvir et al . 2015 ; Kristal - Muscal et al . 2015 ) . In contrast , on the stiffer gels , we observe that the metastatic cells apply a wide range of traction forces ( 100 – 600 nN ) , while forces applied by benign cells typically remain around 100 nN . Interest - ingly , on the 4 . 3 ± 0 . 3 and 10 . 6 ± 0 . 3 kPa PAM gels the low MP cells apply signiﬁcantly larger traction forces than the high MP cells ( p < 0 . 05 ) , while on the 7 . 2 ± 0 . 1 kPa gel , the high MP cells apply larger traction forces . Concurrently , while the cells remain rounded , their areas change with time . We observe that on the stiffer gels that were evaluated ( E > 4 kPa ) , both the high MP and the low MP cells exhibit a decrease in the traction forces as the cell area on the gel increases ( Online Resource 7 ) ; the cells remain round yet increase their contact area . In contrast , the benign cells main - tain the force amplitude constant around 100 nN on all eval - uated gels although the cells increase their area and become more eccentric on the stiffer gels ; on the softest evaluated gel , the three cell lines are statistically indistinguishable . Previous works have shown that more aggressive cells apply more force , at speciﬁc gel stiffness ( Kraning - Rush et al . 2012 ) . At the short times after seeding evaluated here , we observe that depending on the gel stiffness sometimes the low MP cells apply more force . We have previously observed that fractions of the metastatic cells indent the gels , by forces other than solely in - plane traction ( Kristal - Muscal et al . 2013 ; Dvir et al . 2015 ; Kristal - Muscal et al . 2015 ) . The high MP cells typically exhibit a larger fraction of indent - ing cells , where in both cell types indentation decreases with gel stiffness ; cells are unable to indent very stiff gels . This may suggest that the non - indenting subpopulation of the high MP cells evaluated here is somewhat weaker , on some gel stiffnesses , as compared to the corresponding subpopulation of the low MP cells ; the non - indenting cells are typically more motile on the gel surface . The overall stronger traction forces applied by both of the metastatic cells and especially at shorter times likely facilitate , in an in vivo environment , rapid formation of new colonies , allowing the cells to rapidly modify their new environments and populate them . We had previously observed a time - dependent reduction of the forces that lead to gel indentations ( Kristal - Muscal et al . 2013 ) on soft gels ( 2 . 4 kPa ) that was likely correlated with preservation of energy as the cells “recognize” through mechanotransduction that they are unable to penetrate the synthetic gels . A similar maturation of the interaction of the adhering cells with their substrate likely occurs here . Initially the adhering cells apply stronger forces to attach and to purposefully modify their environment , and as the cells establish their more stable contact with the impene - trable gel substrate , they require less force to maintain the contact . That is , the total traction forces are largest at the 123 Metastatic breast cancer cells adhere strongly on varying stiffness substrates , initially . . . shortest times after cell seeding and decrease as the cells form more stable connections . We observe that the forces measured at the longest times of our experiments are sim - ilar to the forces that have previously been measured 24 h after seeding ( Kraning - Rush et al . 2012 ; Kristal - Muscal et al . 2015 ) on similar stiffness gels . This could again indicate stabilization of the cell adherence with time , although even at the longest timescale evaluated here , the metastatic cells still remain rounded ( Kraning - Rush et al . 2012 ) . Hence , the apparent “contact maturation” of the metastatic cells does not seem to require a change in the morphology of the metastatic breast cancer cells , in contrast to the benign cells . To conclude , we note that monitoring the morphology and force application during the early stages of cell adhesion can be used to distinguish the benign from the metastatic cancer cells . We suggest that the rounded morphology maintained by the cancer cells likely enables them to apply more locally focused , stronger traction forces . We had also previously observed the same cells utilize the rounded morphology with a unique internal cell organization to apply combined lat - eral and normal forces and indent softer PAM gels ( Raupach et al . 2007 ; Kristal - Muscal et al . 2013 ; Dvir et al . 2015 ) ; gels are impenetrable , and no chemoattractant was present . Con - currently to locally focusing the applied force , maintaining a rounded morphology may facilitate rapid detachment and migration of the cells if required . The larger forces applied by the evaluated metastatic cells likely facilitate their enhanced invasive and migratory capacity , as compared to the benign cells . While the generality of these phenomena would need to be veriﬁed using different cell types , the measurable param - eters presented here may provide the basis for a quantitative and rapid approach to deliver a more general predictive prog - nosis for likelihood of metastases of tumor cell samples .
