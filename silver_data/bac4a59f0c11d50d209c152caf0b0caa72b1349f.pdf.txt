Spudich , Stanford University School of Medicine , Stanford , CA , March 21 , 2003 ( received for review September 4 , 2002 ) Polymerizing networks of actin ﬁlaments generate force for a variety of movements in living cells , including protrusion of ﬁlop - odia and lamellipodia , intra - and intercellular motility of certain bacterial and viral pathogens , and motility of endocytic vesicles and other membrane - bound organelles . During actin - based motil - ity , coexisting populations of actin ﬁlaments exert both pushing and retarding forces on the moving cargo . To examine the distri - bution and magnitude of forces generated by actin , we have developed a model system where large artiﬁcial lipid vesicles coated with the protein ActA from the bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes are propelled by actin polymerization in cytoplas - mic extract . We ﬁnd that motile vesicles associated with actin comet tails are signiﬁcantly deformed due to an inward compres - sion force exerted by actin polymerization orthogonal to the direction of motion , which is > 10 - fold greater in magnitude than the component of the force exerted in the direction of motion . Furthermore , there is a spatial segregation of the pushing and retarding forces , such that pushing predominates along the sides of the vesicle , although retarding forces predominate at the rear . We estimate that the total net ( pushing minus retarding ) force generated by the actin comet tail is (cid:1) 0 . 4 – 4 nN . In addition , actin comet tail formation is associated with polarization of the ActA protein on the ﬂuid vesicle surface , which may reinforce the persistence of unidirectional motion by helping to maintain a persistent asymmetry of actin ﬁlament density . F orce generation is fundamental to many biological processes , such as muscle contraction , organelle transport , and cellular motility . Cells use a variety of mechanisms to store and transduce chemical energy to produce useful mechanical work . For exam - ple , the molecular motor proteins myosin and kinesin generate forces through conformational changes coupled to ATP hydro - lysis , allowing these proteins to walk along actin or microtubule tracks in a stepwise manner . The force generated by such motor proteins has been precisely measured and extensively studied ( 1 , 2 ) . Polymerizing protein filaments such as actin and microtu - bules can also convert chemical energy into mechanical force , requiring only a nonequilibrium polymerization reaction to transduce chemical free energy to useful mechanical work ( 3 , 4 ) . However , the magnitude and mechanism of force generation by protein polymerization are poorly understood compared with classical motor proteins , despite a broad range of biological processes that use this method of force generation ( 5 – 13 ) . Pathogenic bacteria , viruses , and endocytic vesicles that use actin polymerization - based mechanisms for motility are associ - ated with a characteristic actin ‘‘comet tail’’ structure ( 7 ) formed from a large number of actin filaments crosslinked in a dendritic meshwork ( 14 ) . New actin filaments are continuously nucleated at the cargo surface by using any of a variety of biochemical mechanisms , resulting in the local activation of the Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex , which catalyzes actin filament nucleation and filament branch formation ( 15 ) . The Gram - positive bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes , for example , initiates local actin poly - merization in an infected host cell by using a surface - bound virulence protein , ActA ( 16 ) , which directly activates Arp2 (cid:1) 3 ( 17 , 18 ) , whereas endocytic vesicles use more complex and indirect mechanisms for Arp2 (cid:1) 3 activation ( 10 , 12 , 19 ) . Local - ization of any of several different Arp2 (cid:1) 3 - activating factors to an organelle - sized object can generate formation of comet tails with similar overall structures that propel objects at comparable speeds , suggesting that it is the force exerted by the organ - ized polymerizing meshwork of actin filaments and not the specific identity of the surface nucleation factor that results in movement . Recently , the development of increasingly simplified recon - stituted motility systems where bacteria or artificial cargos are propelled by actin comet tails ( 20 – 23 ) has made it possible to perturb and study the biochemical and biophysical parameters governing polymerization - based motility . In addition , several detailed biophysical models ( 24 – 28 ) have been formulated to predict the magnitude and direction of the forces generated by actin polymerization in the comet tail . Here we describe a membrane - based reconstituted motility system that has enabled us to measure the spatial distribution and approximate magni - tude of the forces generated by actin in a motile comet tail . Our results are in agreement with the major qualitative predictions of a class of mesoscopic biophysical models that consider elastic energy stored in the growing comet tail actin gel as a major modality of force transduction , but they disprove several quan - titative predictions of published versions of these models ( 23 , 26 , 29 , 30 ) . Furthermore , our results extend the predictions of a microscopic model where coexisting populations of actin fila - ments can exert both retarding and pushing forces ( 27 , 31 ) . Materials and Methods Large multilamellar vesicles were prepared from a 46 : 50 : 2 : 2 molar ratio of phosphatidylcholine (cid:1) cholesterol (cid:1) fluorescein - phosphatidylethanolamine (cid:1) Ni - NTA chelating lipid . Further de - tails of vesicle preparation and coating of polystyrene beads with lipid monolayers can be found in Supporting Text , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site , www . pnas . org . His - tagged ActA was purified as previously de - scribed ( 18 , 21 ) and adsorbed on the surface of vesicles and lipid - coated beads at saturating amounts ( (cid:1) 10 7 molecules per bead estimated by quantitative Western blot ) . Motility assays were adapted from ref . 21 . ActA - coated vesicles were added to Xenopus laevis egg cytoplasmic extract diluted to 40 % of original protein concentration with Xenopus extract buffer ( 32 ) doped with tetramethylrhodamine iodoacetamide - labeled monomeric actin and ATP regenerating mix ( 32 ) . Vesicle motility was visualized on a Zeiss Axioplan microscope equipped with phase contrast and epifluorescence optics by using a (cid:2) 63 , numerical aperture 1 . 4 objective and a back - thinned cooled charge - coupled device camera ( Princeton Instruments , Trenton , NJ ) . Phase - contrast , fluorescein , and rhodamine images were acquired every 5 s . Quantitative measurements and data analysis were performed by using METAMORPH software ( Universal Imaging , Media , PA ) .

We have developed a model system where artificial lipid vesicles ranging in size from a few hundred nanometers to tens of micrometers are propelled by actin comet tails nucleated by a form of the L . monocytogenes ActA protein ( 21 ) ( see Movies 1 – 3 , which are published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) . Most vesicles associated with comet tails were (cid:1) 1 – 5 (cid:1) m in diameter , although occasionally much larger membranous struc - tures of varying shapes also nucleated actin and moved unidi - rectionally ( Movie 2 ) . Some actin - associated vesicles could be observed budding from larger membrane masses . During bud - ding , actin filaments accumulated in a collar around the neck of the nascent vesicle . Further polymerization caused the neck to stretch , eventually forming a persistent lipid tubule tether run - ning down the core of the comet tail ( Movie 3 ) . These tethers would occasionally snap , liberating a motile actin - associated vesicle that often resorbed the trailing lipid tubule ( Movie 1 ) . Free motile ActA - coated vesicles associated with actin comet tails were deformed , exhibiting an asymmetrical tear - drop shape with the longer axis parallel to the direction of motion and the end with highest curvature associated with the comet tail . In contrast , similarly prepared control vesicles not coated with ActA ( and therefore not associated with actin ) usually adopted a symmetrical spherical or prolate spheroid shape in cytoplasmic extract ( Fig . 1 A and B ) . To determine whether this qualitative shape difference was significant , we measured the major and minor axes on images of 121 ActA - coated , actin - associated vesicles and 242 control vesicles of similar sizes . Ninety - eight percent of actin - associated vesicles were tear - drop shaped , com - pared with only 7 % of control vesicles . ( Fig . 1 C and D ) . Similar distorted shapes have been reported for native endocytic vesicles associated with actin comet tails ( 12 ) . The characteristic distorted shape suggested that the comet tails exerted an inward compression force , orthogonal to the direction of motion , that pinched the rear of the vesicles . Consistent with this idea , we observed that the total volume of most vesicles decreased slowly over time , presumably as water was squeezed out through the semipermeable lipid bilayer ( average volume loss 0 . 006 (cid:1) m 3 (cid:1) s , or (cid:1) 0 . 0004 volume (cid:1) s ) . The observation of compression forces generated by actin comet tails is consistent with a class of biophysical models that focus on accumulation of stress in the crosslinked actin gel as a major modality of force storage and transduction ( 23 , 26 , 29 , 30 ) but has not previously been demonstrated experimentally . Actin - Dependent Polarization of ActA Protein . It was initially sur - prising that such large vesicles ( (cid:1) 5 (cid:1) m in diameter ) were able to form actin comet tails , because under similar conditions poly - styrene beads coated with immobilized ActA cannot break symmetry to form a polarized comet tail if their diameter is (cid:3) 2 (cid:1) m ( 21 ) . However , large beads coated asymmetrically with ActA can form polarized comet tails ( 21 ) . We therefore hypothesized that lateral movement of ActA on the surface of the fluid phospholipid bilayer might facilitate symmetry - breaking for vesicles . We compared the distribution of fluorescently labeled ActA ( Fig . 2 B , blue curve ) on vesicles associated with actin comet tails with fluorescently labeled lipid ( Fig . 2 A , green curve ) in similar vesicles and found a striking specific accumu - lation of ActA at the rear of the vesicle ( Fig . 2 A and B ; Movie 4 , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) . The distribution of ActA closely paralleled the distri - bution of actin filaments ( Fig . 2 B , red curve ) . Although ActA has not been shown to bind directly to actin filaments , ActA is known to bind F - actin indirectly via VASP and the Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex ( 33 – 35 ) , so it seems likely that the polarization of ActA on motile vesicles was due to its indirect binding to actin filaments in the comet tail . To determine whether this ActA asymmetry was due solely to actin - based forces acting on a fluid membrane surface or whether variations in membrane curvature might also affect ActA distribution , we examined the distribution of ActA on the surface of large ( 1 . 5 - (cid:1) m - diameter ) hydrophobic polystyrene beads coated with a lipid monolayer in association with actin comet tails . The surface of these beads is approximately as fluid as a simple lipid bilayer ( 36 ) , but the beads are not deformable . We found substantial accumulation of ActA on the rear half of the bead , suggesting that the actin - dependent ActA polarization could occur independently of deformation ( Fig . 2 C and D ) . Because ActA catalyzes nucleation of new actin filaments via its Fig . 1 . Actin - based deformation of large ActA - coated lipid vesicles in cyto - plasmic extracts .

Both b (cid:1) a and c (cid:1) a were signiﬁcantly smaller for the population of actin - associated vesicles than for the population of control vesicles ( P (cid:5) 0 . 0001 by Student’s t test ) , indicating that the actin comet tails caused the vesicles to become both narrower and more asymmetrical . 6494 (cid:2) www . pnas . org (cid:1) cgi (cid:1) doi (cid:1) 10 . 1073 (cid:1) pnas . 1031670100 Giardini et al . interaction with Arp2 (cid:1) 3 ( 18 ) , it is likely that actin - dependent ActA polarization in turn contributes to maintaining a persistent asymmetry of actin filament density on the vesicle surface and thus reinforcing persistent unidirectional motion over time . Analysis of Vesicle Motion . To understand how vesicle shape changes correlated with changes in speed and actin tail dynamics , we recorded and analyzed phase - contrast and fluorescent time - lapse movies of a large number of untethered moving vesicles ( Fig . 3 A ; Movie 1 , for example ) . Individual vesicles underwent significant changes in degree of deformation , speed , and comet tail actin density over periods of several minutes ( Fig . 3 ) . Our data set included movies of 121 actin - associated vesicles . The mean vesicle size in the measured population was 2 . 9 (cid:1) m in equivalent spherical diameter ( SD ; SD (cid:4) 1 . 0 (cid:1) m ) . These vesicles underwent a broad range of deformation , where the mean D was 0 . 29 ( SD (cid:4) 0 . 16 ; Fig . 4 A ) . Speeds also varied throughout the population as well as over the course of each movie ( mean (cid:4) 0 . 05 (cid:1) m (cid:1) s , SD (cid:4) 0 . 04 ; Fig . 4 B ) . There were no correlations between the degree of vesicle deformation and speed , size , or tail fluorescence over the population as a whole ( Fig . 4 C and D ) . Variability in membrane tension among the vesicles in the population might mask informative correlations between vesicle deformation and speed or actin density . Therefore , we examined the correlations between time - dependent changes in those three parameters for each individual vesicle . For all tracks longer than 200 s ( n (cid:4) 39 ) , we calculated the cross - correlation coefficient between deformation and speed ( R ds ) , deformation and peak fluorescence intensity ( R df ) , and speed and peak fluorescence intensity ( R sf ) . Across the population , the mean values of R ds and R df were not significantly different from zero ( 0 . 07 and (cid:6) 0 . 03 ) . The mean value of R sf was (cid:6) 0 . 39 , which is statistically significant at P (cid:5) 0 . 01 by Student’s t test . In other words , during segments of each movie where the peak actin comet tail density was higher than average , speed was likely to be lower than average ( Fig . 4 E ; see Supporting Text ) . Thus , changes in vesicle speed appeared to be coupled to changes in the comet tail actin filament density , such that comet tails became more dense as their associated vesicles slowed down . However , the forces responsible for vesicle deformation appeared to be largely independent of the forces responsible for determining net vesicle speed . Fig . 2 .

Next , we wished to deter - mine the spatial distribution of the forces responsible for vesicle deformation . Because the physical properties of artificial phos - pholipid vesicles have been well characterized ( 37 – 42 ) , we were able to use the degree and shape of vesicle deformations as a direct readout of the distribution of the sum of forces acting on the vesicle surfaces . We performed initial calculations on a canonical vesicle shape that represented an average member of the measured population ( Fig . 5 A ) . Because our movies showed that each vesicle shape and actin distribution changed only slowly with time , we assumed that the external forces per unit area balanced the internal pressure at every point on the vesicle surface and at every moment in time ( i . e . , the system is quasistatic ) . At any given moment in time , the net external pressure applied at each point on the vesicle surface is the sum of pressure due to membrane tension acting inward ( P (cid:4) ) , and pressure from two coexisting populations of actin filaments within the comet tail : unattached , polymerizing actin filaments pushing normal to the surface ( P p ) ( 25 ) , and attached actin filaments exerting a retarding force on the surface ( P r ) ( 25 , 26 , 30 ) . Because the separate effects of these two filament populations are not directly observable in our assay , we calculate only the net ( pushing minus retarding ) pressure due to actin ( P n (cid:4) P p (cid:6) P r ) . The internal pressure due to osmotic pressure ( P o ) is a constant everywhere and exactly balanced by the external pressure in the quasistatic case so that : P o (cid:5) P (cid:4) (cid:6) P n , [ 1 ] where both P (cid:4) and P n can vary with position along the mem - brane . Hydrodynamic drag is not included in Eq . 1 because the drag associated with movement of a 3 - (cid:1) m - diameter vesicle through viscous cytoplasm at the observed speeds is (cid:5) 100 fN , according to Stokes’ Law ( 43 ) , and is therefore negligible . To calculate the distribution of the pressure due to actin , we first determined the distribution and magnitude of the pressure due to membrane tension . The spatial distribution of the pres - sure P (cid:4) due to a constant membrane tension can be readily determined from the vesicle shape alone , because this pressure varies inversely with local membrane surface curvature , such that the pressure due to membrane tension is greatest where the radius of curvature is smallest ( Fig . 5 B ) . Because the actin filament density on the hemispherical front end of the vesicle was negligible and therefore so was the net actin pressure , the internal osmotic pressure must be P o (cid:5) P (cid:4) (cid:2) hemisphere (cid:5) 2 (cid:4) b , [ 2 ] where b is the radius of the hemisphere , and (cid:4) is the membrane tension . On the parabolic rear end of the vesicle , the sum of membrane pressure and actin pressure must balance the osmotic pressure found in Eq . 2 . Thus , the net pressure due to actin can be found from P n (cid:5) P (cid:4) (cid:2) hemisphere (cid:7) P (cid:4) (cid:2) parabola (cid:5) (cid:4) (cid:3) 2 b (cid:7) (cid:4) 1 R 1 (cid:6) 1 R 2 (cid:5)(cid:6) , [ 3 ] where R 1 and R 2 are the local radii of curvature , and the membrane tension (cid:4) is assumed to be constant around the vesicle . Eq . 3 shows that net actin pressure scales linearly with Fig . 4 . Distribution of deformation , speed , and size across a population of motile vesicles .

Net actin pressure required to balance forces due to osmotic pressure and P (cid:4) is represented in Fig . 5 C , and all pressures including membrane pressure around the front and rear of the vesicle are plotted in Fig . 5 D in terms of multiples of (cid:4) . Actin pressure is positive around the sides , indicating a net pushing force into the vesicle , and negative at the rear , indicating a net retarding force pulling away from the vesicle . Notably , this analysis suggests that the pressure normal to the vesicle surface that is generated by actin does not scale linearly with actin filament density ( see Fig . 3 C ) , in contrast to the implicit predictions of most simple biophysical models ( 3 , 24 , 25 ) . This may be due to spatial variations in actin filament length and crosslinking density , filament orientation ( 25 ) , and ratio be - tween numbers of attached and unattached filaments ( 27 ) , all of which are predicted to affect the magnitude of the net actin force . Integrating all net normal pressures due to actin over the entire vesicle surface , we find that the component of actin - dependent force that can push the vesicle forward ( parallel to the direction of motion ) is smaller than the inward compression force ( orthogonal to the direction of motion ) by 13 - fold . That is , most of the force generated by the actin tail is used to compress the vesicle , whereas (cid:5) 10 % of the available force is used to push it . Estimated Magnitude of Forces Generated by the Actin Comet Tail . Although we are able to use the observed vesicle shape to calculate the relative spatial distributions of the pressure com - ponents P (cid:4) and P n ( Fig . 5 B – D ) , the magnitude of these pressures can be calculated only by knowing the magnitude of the mem - brane tension (cid:4) . In our experimental system , we cannot directly measure (cid:4) , but we can set limits on its range by considering the material properties of the artificial phospholipid vesicles ( see Supporting Text and Movie 5 , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) . Using the estimated lower - and upper - limit values of (cid:4) (cid:4) 0 . 01 (cid:6) 0 . 1 mN (cid:1) m , we can calculate a range of magnitudes of the pressures due to actin at every point on the vesicle surface , because the amount of total integrated actin pressure required to maintain the observed teardrop shapes is linearly proportional to the value of (cid:4) . Integrating the calculated normal actin pressure over the surface of the canon - ical vesicle shown in Fig . 5 A , we determined that the minimum amount of net force generated by actin comet tails necessary to maintain this shape is (cid:1) 0 . 4 (cid:6) 4 nN . As described above , (cid:5) 10 % of this net force ( 0 . 03 – 0 . 3 nN ) is supplied along the direction of motion ; most of the force is orthogonal to the direction of motion and contributes to vesicle distortion . Our confidence in the force estimate is compromised by two issues . First , proteins in the extract may associate with the surface of the artificial vesicles to change the effective membrane tension in unpredictable ways ; and second , the membrane tension for motile vesicles associated with actin comet tails may change over time as the vesicles are increasingly distorted and volume is squeezed out . For these reasons , the upper force limit of 4 nN must be considered provisional . Forces in the nanon - ewton range are consistent with previous theoretical and exper - imental analyses ( refs . 26 , 29 , and 44 ; see Supporting Text ) . Discussion The most important conclusion of this work is that most of the force generated by actin comet tails is compressive rather than propulsive . Our findings indicate that the component of force orthogonal to the direction of motion is (cid:3) 10 - fold greater than the component in the direction of motion . Significant compres - sion forces orthogonal to the direction of motion have been predicted by a mesoscopic biophysical model of comet tail force generation where energy released by actin polymerization is stored as elastic deformation in the comet tail actin gel ( 23 , 26 , 29 , 30 ) . Models of this class consider the actin in the comet tail as a continuous gel that expands when gel growth is catalyzed on a bacterial or bead surface . Strain accumulating in the gel is relieved by forward motion of the object as inward - directed forces are exerted on the curved surface at the rear of the bead or bacterium . Therefore , for deformable objects such as vesicles , compression forces balancing actin gel expansion forces would be predicted to squeeze the object . Although qualitatively our observations are consistent with this prediction , the model predicts that the largest compressive forces would be positioned at the rear of the cargo ( 26 ) . In contrast , our results indicate that the net actin polymerization force exerted orthogonal to the direction of motion is greatest on the vesicle sides and minimal at the vesicle rear . In fact , we find that the net forces in the rear of the vesicle are oriented opposite the direction of motion , suggesting a spatial partitioning of pushing and retarding forces , a finding not predicted by any biophysical models to date . Furthermore , the strain accumulation model predicts that strain must accumulate in the actin gel before forward motion of the cargo ( 26 ) . In our vesicle system , this would correspond to a negative correlation between vesicle deformation and vesicle speed . The lack of significant correlation between these param - eters suggests that temporal partitioning of pushing and retard - ing forces is not a predominant mechanism for force transduc - tion in this system . These results may be in part explained by the fact that , although the net ratio of pushing to retarding forces may be spatially regulated , the release of retarding attachments at the rear of the vesicle is not synchronized for the entire population of attached filaments . Different actin filaments in - teracting with the cargo surface may be attached or growing for different amounts of time ( 27 ) . If the polymerization and binding of each filament are asynchronous and independent of neigh - boring filaments , their effects would average and result in a continuous strain accumulation and release of friction , instead of a catastrophic release of the vesicle followed by bursts in forward movement as had been previously predicted ( 26 ) . Quantitative predictions of the model based on elastic prop - erties of actin comet tails estimate total polymerization forces in the nanonewton range ( 29 , 30 ) , consistent with our estimates of the total net actin - dependent force between 0 . 4 and 4 nN . We have found that most of this force ( 93 % ) is exerted orthogonal to the direction of motion . Vesicles of the size we considered in this study require only 100 - fN force to overcome hydrodynamic drag , yet most of the actin polymerization force is exerted orthogonal to the direction of motion , resulting overall in an astonishing inefficiency of the transduction of the chemical energy liberated by actin polymerization into productive forward motion . Other forms of biological movement are also energet - ically inefficient ; for example , the classic flagellar rotor that propels many bacteria through liquid media translates (cid:5) 1 % of the energy required to turn the rotor into forward motion ( 44 ) . In the actin comet tail , the excess mechanical energy used in compressing the cargo may contribute to the stability and persistence of motion . Intracellular L . monocytogenes , for exam - ple , readily push their way through dense thickets of organelles . Their actin - dependent motion cannot be slowed by the action of optical tweezers ( 26 ) and is slowed only 20 - fold with a 500 - fold change in the viscoelastic properties of the cytoplasmic extract ( 45 ) . Slight repartitioning of the powerful mechanical forces at the surface among compression , friction , and propulsion may be sufficient to render this type of actin - based motility very robust to large environmental perturbations . Our results confirm some theoretical predictions of the ‘‘tethered ratchet’’ model ( 27 ) , where coexisting populations of actin filaments may be exerting different types of forces depending on whether they are bound or under compression . The observation that the net pushing and Giardini et al . PNAS (cid:2) May 27 , 2003 (cid:2) vol . 100 (cid:2) no . 11 (cid:2) 6497 C E LL B I O L O G Y retarding forces spatially partition on the sides and rear of the vesicle extends the predictions of this model . See Supporting Text for a discussion of possible molecular mechanisms for force partitioning on vesicle surfaces . In summary , our results directly demonstrate that forces generated by actin comet tails are largely compressive rather than simply propulsive . We show that different types of net actin forces , pushing and retarding , operate on the vesicle surface in a spatially defined manner . Our data rule out a temporally coordinated mechanism of strain accumulation followed by sudden release , contrary to the predictions of mathematical models based on actin gel expansion .
