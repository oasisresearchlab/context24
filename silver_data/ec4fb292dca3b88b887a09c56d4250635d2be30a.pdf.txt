Humphries ( martin . humphries @ manchester . ac . uk ) ; Benjamin T . Goult ( b . t . goult @ kent . ac . uk ) Abstract Talin is a mechanosensitive component of adhesion complexes that directly couples integrins to the actin cytoskeleton . In response to force , talin undergoes switch - like behaviour of its multiple rod domains that modulate interactions with its binding partners . Cyclin - dependent kinase - 1 ( CDK1 ) is a key regulator of the cell cycle , exerting its effects through synchronised phosphorylation of a large number of protein targets . CDK1 activity also maintains adhesion during interphase , and its inhibition is a prerequisite for the tightly choreographed changes in cell shape and adhesiveness that are required for successful completion of mitosis . Using a combination of biochemical , structural and cell biological approaches , we demonstrate a direct interaction between talin and CDK1 that occurs at sites of integrin - mediated adhesion . Mutagenesis demonstrated that CDK1 contains a functional talin - binding LD motif , and the binding site within talin was pinpointed to helical bundle R8 through the use of recombinant fragments . Talin also contains a consensus CDK1 phosphorylation motif centred on S1589 ; a site that was phosphorylated by CDK1 in vitro . A phosphomimetic mutant of this site within talin lowered the binding affinity of KANK and weakened the mechanical response of the region , potentially altering downstream mechanotransduction pathways . The direct binding of the master cell cycle regulator , CDK1 , to the primary integrin effector , talin , therefore provides a primordial solution for coupling the cell proliferation and cell adhesion machineries , and thereby enables microenvironmental control of cell division in multicellular organisms .

Introduction Cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) is required for anchorage - dependent cell survival and growth in multicellular organisms . During the G1 commitment phase of the cell cycle , adhesion signalling is required to initiate DNA synthesis ( 1 , 2 ) and suppress apoptosis ( 3 , 4 ) . However , how changes in adhesion signalling are able to influence cell cycle progression in adherent cells is only partly elucidated . During mitosis , major changes in integrin adhesion complexes ( IACs ) , cytoskeletal architecture and cell shape are obligatory for chromosome segregation and cytokinesis ( 5 – 8 ) . These remodelling events can be so extensive that cells become round and virtually lose their adhesion . Despite the risks to tissue integrity , the optimally symmetrical geometry of a sphere appears to enable the high degree of precision required for chromosome capture and division plane orientation ( 9 – 11 ) . Suppression of these changes during mitosis perturbs the ability of cells to divide accurately ( 12 – 14 ) . All of these changes are highly conserved , implying the existence of a primordial regulatory mechanism linking the cell cycle and adhesion machineries . One link between the cell cycle and adhesion is mediated through the master regulator of the cell cycle , cyclin - dependent kinase - 1 ( CDK1 ) . CDK1 is a serine / threonine kinase that partners with cyclins that control both kinase activity and substrate specificity ( 15 ) . CDK1 inhibition leads to disassembly of IACs , suggesting that CDK1 activity has an interphase role in promoting integrin - mediated adhesion and actomyosin organisation ( 12 , 16 ) . IAC area increases during S phase in a CDK1 - dependent manner , then inhibition of CDK1 through Wee1 - mediated phosphorylation in G2 causes IAC loss in preparation for entry into mitosis ( 12 ) . Together , these findings identify a key role for CDK1 in the regulation of adhesion during cell cycle progression . Talins are large ( 270 kDa ) multidomain proteins composed of an N - terminal head coupled to a large rod comprising 13 helical bundles ( R1 - R13 ) ( 17 ) . The two talin isoforms ( talin - 1 and talin - 2 ) are considered to be the principal proteins that couple integrins to F - actin . The N - terminal FERM domain binds to integrin cytoplasmic domains ( 18 – 21 ) and two sites in the C - terminal flexible rod domain bind F - actin ( 22 , 23 ) . Talin binding to integrins is maintained by actomyosin - generated force and results in conformational activation of integrins ( 20 ) . The linkage therefore provides a regulatable means of controlling cell adhesion to the ECM from within the cell . This trimolecular core also initiates the recruitment of a large number of additional proteins , termed the adhesome , which varies in composition between IAC type ( 24 – 26 ) , reflecting distinct effector , signalling , and mechanosensing functions . The role of talin as a key mechanotransducer relies on its ability to undergo force - dependent structural rearrangements . As force from actin is exerted on talin anchored to integrins , the talin rod gradually unfolds at discrete sites , resulting in both the displacement and recruitment of signalling proteins . This enables talin to serve as a mechanosensitive signalling hub , integrating a wide range of signals to produce diverse cellular responses ( 27 ) . Here , we identify a direct interaction between CDK1 and talin through an unbiased analysis of talin binding proteins . CDK1 contains a talin - binding LD motif that interacts directly with the R8 domain of talin . This interaction is required for regulating CDK1 function at IACs and leads to an alteration in the mechanosensitivity of talin . Direct mechanical coupling of the master cell cycle regulator and the principal integrin effector provides an elegant mechanism coupling the cell division and adhesion machineries to facilitate proliferation in a multicellular environment . Results Talin associates with CDK1 at adhesion sites To identify novel talin binding proteins , full - length talin - 1 fused to GFP was expressed in U2OS cells and interacting proteins identified by GFP - Trap pull - down and mass spectrometry . Multiple proteins were identified , including previously characterised ligands such as vinculin , KANK proteins and integrins ( Fig 1A and Supp Table 1 ) . In addition , peptides covering a large proportion of CDK1 ( SAINT Score 0 . 96 ) were detected with high confidence in all three talin pulldowns , but never in the GFP controls , suggesting that CDK1 also associates with talin . The mass spectrometry data were confirmed by western blotting of the GFP - talin pulldown with anti - CDK1 antibody ( Fig 1B ) . To support these findings , CDK1 was tagged with BirA * , expressed in U2OS cells , and BioID proximity biotinylation employed to label proteins close to CDK1 in situ . Using this approach , 118 labelled proteins were identified , including the known CDK1 interactors , cyclin B1 and cyclin B2 ( Supp Table 2 ) . 47 % of the identified proteins were found within the meta adhesome , suggestive of a role for CDK1 in regulating adhesion / cytoskeletal dynamics ( 28 ) . Furthermore , in addition to talin , the core adhesome components , vinculin , paxillin , filamin A and CRK , were in close proximity to CDK1 ( Fig 1C ) . Finally , TIRF microscopy was employed to determine the localisation of CDK1 at the cell - ECM interface . mScarlet - CDK1 was distributed in elongated , fleck - like structures that partially overlapped with GFP - talin - containing IACs ( Fig 1D ) . Taken together , these findings indicate a close association between talin and CDK1 at sites of integrin - mediated adhesion to the ECM . Figure 1 : Talin interacts with CDK1 .

CDK1 contains an LD motif that binds directly to talin R8 We next aimed to identify the binding interface between talin and CDK1 . Talin contains multiple binding sites for proteins that contain leucine / aspartic acid LD motifs , with a consensus sequence I / LDxØØxØØ ( where Ø denotes a hydrophobic residue ) ( 30 , 31 ) . These amphipathic helical peptide motifs engage talin via a helix - addition mechanism ( 32 , 33 ) , packing on the side of the helical bundles in the talin rod . This mode of binding allows mechanosensitive regulation as it only occurs when the talin rod domain mediating the interaction is folded : unfolding due to mechanical force disrupts the LD motif binding site and the connection is severed ( 27 ) .

The five talin rod fragments screened for binding to CDK1 are highlighted : R1 - R3 ( residues 482 - 911 , pink ) , R4 - R8 ( residues 913 - 1653 , green ) , R9 - R10 ( residues 1655 - 2015 , orange ) , R11 - R12 ( 1974 - 2293 , yellow ) and R13 - DD ( 2300 - 2542 , cyan ) .

Dissociation constants ± SE ( µM ) for the interactions are indicated in the legend . All measurements were performed in triplicate . ND = not determined . Analysis of the CDK1 protein sequence identified a highly conserved , consensus LD motif sequence between residues 206 - 223 ( Fig 2A , B ) , which we postulated might bind directly to talin . Fluorescence polarisation was employed to test direct binding , as described previously ( 34 , 35 ) . In this assay , a synthetic peptide spanning the CDK1 LD motif , CDK1 ( 206 - 223 ) , is fluorescently - tagged and titrated against an increasing concentration of unlabelled talin fragment ; any binding between the two polypeptides results in an increase in the fluorescence polarisation signal . To identify the putative CDK1 binding site ( s ) on talin , six talin fragments were generated that span the whole molecule ; F0 - F3 , R1 - R3 , R4 - R8 , R9 - R10 , R11 - R12 and R13 - DD ( Fig 2C ) . Two of these fragments incorporate the actin - binding sites in the talin rod , ABS2 ( R4 - R8 ( 23 , 36 ) ) and ABS3 ( R13 - DD ( 37 , 38 ) ) . No significant interaction was observed between CDK1 ( 206 - 223 ) and the talin Head , R1 - R3 , R9 - R10 , R11 - R12 or R13 - DD fragments ; however , R4 - R8 demonstrated increasing fluorescence polarisation with increasing talin concentration , indicative of a direct interaction ( Fig 2D ) . To further define the CDK1 binding site within talin R4 - R8 , we tested binding to additional rod domain constructs . Talin R4 - R6 demonstrated negligible binding to CDK1 ( 206 - 223 ) , whereas R7R8 bound to CDK1 ( 206 - 223 ) with a Kd of 14 µM ( Fig 2E ) . The R7R8 region of both talin isoforms , talin - 1 and talin - 2 , bound CDK1 ( 206 - 223 ) with similar affinity ( Fig 2E ) . As found for other LD motif peptides ( 35 ) , mutation of the LD motif within CDK1 to two alanine residues ( to generate a 2A mutant ; Fig 3A , B ) markedly reduced the interaction with talin ( Fig 3C ) .

( E ) Mapping of the CDK1 binding site on R8 as detected by NMR using weighted chemical shift differences ( red ) – mapped onto the R7R8 structure . ( F ) GFP - Trap pulldowns from cells expressing GFP alone , GFP - WT - talin - 1 or GFP - D R8 - talin - 1 along with HA - tagged WT or 2A - CDK1 , followed by western blotting for GFP and HA . The CDK1 LD motif binding pocket on talin R8 differs from that of DLC1 and RIAM We initially used NMR to characterise the interaction between CDK1 and talin . HSQC spectra of 15 N - labeled talin - 1 R7R8 were collected in the absence and presence of increasing amounts of CDK1 ( 206 - 223 ) peptide ( Fig 3D ) . Addition of CDK1 ( 206 - 223 ) peptide , but not CDK1 - 2A , resulted in progressive chemical shift changes to a subset of the R8 residues , indicative of a direct , specific interaction . Using the chemical shift assignments of the R8 domain of talin - 1 ( BMRB ID : 19339 ( 33 ) ) , the changes were mapped onto the structure of R8 ( PDB ID : 2X0C ( 40 ) ) . The changes mapped onto one face of the R8 domain , the same region that binds the LD motifs of DLC1 ( 33 ) and RIAM ( 17 , 41 ) ( Fig 3E ) . To support the requirement for the talin R8 domain in interacting with CDK1 , GFP - Trap pulldowns were performed using wild - type ( WT ) full - length talin or talin lacking the R8 domain ( D R8 ) . WT - talin - 1 - GFP pulled down HA - tagged CDK1 - WT , but not HA - CDK1 - 2A , whereas D R8 - talin - 1 - GFP failed to associate with HA - CDK1 - WT ( Fig 3F ) . To resolve the structural basis of the talin - CDK1 interaction , the R7R8 - CDK1 peptide complex was crystallised and the structure determined to 2 . 28Å resolution ( Fig 4A , B ) . The structure contained two R7R8 molecules within the asymmetric unit , each with CDK1 peptides localised to the respective R8 domains ( Supp Fig 1A ; Supp Table 3 ) . Each peptide was exceptionally resolved in both the F 0 - F C weighted difference map and simulated annealing OMIT maps ( Supp Fig 1B , C ) . Unexpectedly , the CDK1 peptide was oriented perpendicular to the helices of the R8 fold , forming a pseudo - 5 - helix bundle ( Fig 4A , B ) that contrasts with the helix - addition mechanism of DLC1 and RIAM ( 33 , 41 ) ( Fig 4 C , D ) . This arrangement was supported by NMR chemical shift mapping ( Fig 3E ) , where the shift changes upon addition of CDK1 peptide were located predominantly at one end of the LD motif - binding surface of the bundle . The CDK1 peptide was identified on the basis of sequence homology with the LD motif . In previous studies of LD motif recognition , the aspartate residue of the LD motif was shown to form a salt bridge with a positively charged residue on the cognate binding site ( 42 ) and , in the case of DLC1 , mutation of talin K1544 abolished interactions with R8 ( 33 ) . The CDK1 - talin structure deviated from this shared interaction mechanism as K1544 was not involved in the interaction , but instead oriented away from the CDK1 binding site . The isoleucine side chain of the LD motif was responsible for displacing the K1544 side chain and an ID / AA double mutation attenuated the CDK1 - talin interaction ( Fig 4B ) . The remainder of the CDK1 peptide formed a hydrophobic interface with the R8 domain with the CDK1 214 FRIFRA 219 sequence buried into a hydrophobic groove between the helices formed of talin residues L1492 , A1495 , V1498 , L1539 , V1540 and I1543 ( Fig 4B ) .

( E ) Modelled structure of talin ( grey ) bound to the complex of CDK1 ( blue ) and cyclin B1 ( orange ) using ( PDB ID : 4YC3 ( 39 ) ) . ( F ) Structure of the tripartite complex of CDK1 ( blue ) , cyclin B1 ( orange ) and CKS2 ( grey ) ( PDB ID : 4YC3 ) . Talin R8 and CKS2 both bind CDK1 via the same region on the opposite face to the cyclin binding surface . The CDK1 sequence formed an amphipathic helix that closely resembled its conformation in full - length CDK1 ( PDB ID : 4YC6 ( 39 ) ) , where the key residues involved in talin binding are surface exposed ( Supp Fig 2 ) . The structure of this lobe of the kinase has been solved in complex with other proteins such as CKS1 ( cyclin - dependent regulatory subunit 1 ) ( 39 ) , suggesting it may play a role as a targeting domain . As the CDK1 ID - motif peptide superimposed on the CDK1 structure , it was possible to model the interaction between talin and the CDK1 - cyclin B1 complex ( Fig 4E , F ) . This demonstrated that the talin - CDK1 interaction is unlikely to perturb CDK1 binding to regulatory cyclin proteins and suggests the possibility that talin is able to interact with active CDK1 - cyclin complexes . Talin binding is required for CDK1 - dependent regulation of adhesion We previously demonstrated that CDK1 kinase activity is required to maintain IACs and to facilitate changes in IAC area during cell cycle progression ( 12 ) . To test whether these functions were dependent on the interaction between CDK1 and talin , the effects of mutant versions of both proteins were determined . Consistent with previous data , knockdown of CDK1 in asynchronous cells resulted in a reduction in paxillin - positive IAC area that was rescued by re - expression of siRNA - resistant WT CDK1 , but not CDK1 - 2A ( which is unable to bind talin ; Supp Fig 3A , B ) . In addition , in synchronised cells expressing CDK1 - WT , the robust IAC growth previously observed during S phase did not occur in cells expressing CDK1 - 2A ( Supp Fig 3C ) . These findings indicate that the CDK1 LD motif is required for CDK1 to maintain IACs in asynchronous cells and to facilitate IAC growth during S phase . Subsequent analysis of the CDK1 - 2A mutant protein demonstrated complexing with cyclin B1 , but not cyclin A2 , and a lack of phosphorylation at the activating site T161 ( Supp Fig 3D , E ) . While talin binding may therefore contribute to CDK1 activation , since CDK1 - cyclin A2 maintains IACs ( 9 ) , it therefore cannot be concluded that the effects of CDK1 - 2A on adhesion are solely attributable to the loss of CDK1 binding to talin . In complementary studies , the effects of D R8 - talin - 1 expression on IACs were examined . In cells expressing WT talin - 1 , a dose - dependent reduction in IAC area was observed following treatment of cells with the CDK1 inhibitor RO3306 . In contrast , no loss of IAC area was observed in cells expressing D R8 - talin - 1 ( Fig 5A , B ) . Furthermore , in synchronised cells expressing D R8 - talin - 1 , IAC area remained constant through G1 , S and G2 , while cells expressing WT talin - 1 displayed IAC growth during S ( Fig 5C ) . These data demonstrate that the talin R8 domain is required for facilitating CDK1 - dependent regulation of IACs .

CDK1 phosphorylates talin R7R8 and modulates its mechanosensitivity Talin R8 binds to CDK1 in a similar region to the regulatory CKS proteins that target CDK1 to specific substrates and facilitate CDK1 - dependent phosphorylation ( 39 , 43 ) . We therefore hypothesised that binding of CDK1 to talin might lead to phosphorylation of residues within the R7R8 region . Incubation of talin - 1 R7R8 and CDK1 - cyclin A with ATP in vitro resulted in a high level of phosphorylation of R7R8 ( Fig 6A , B ) , and subsequent analysis by mass spectrometry identified a single phosphorylation at S1589 . Furthermore , sequence analysis identified the presence of a consensus CDK1 phosphorylation motif ( SP ) at S1589 ( Fig 6B - D ) . The positioning of the talin - 1 phosphorylation site is at the end of the R7 rod domain close to where R8 is inserted ( Fig . 6C - D ) , and is adjacent to two charged residues D1451 and E1591 . We predicted that phosphorylation of S1589 might lead to repulsion from these acidic residues , resulting in decreased stability of both R7 and R8 and a potential weakening of the binding of ligands to R7R8 . To determine if S1589 phosphorylation affected the binding of KANK to R7 and DLC1 and CDK1 binding to R8 ( 33 , 35 ) , a talin phosphomimetic mutant ( S1589D ) was designed and the binding affinity of the CDK1 , KANK and DLC1 peptide ligands to R7R8 measured by fluorescence polarisation . Binding of both R8 ligands was largely unaffected by the talin - 1 S1589D mutation , but the affinity of KANK binding was approximately four - fold lower ( Kd 4 µM and 1 µM for the mutant and WT , respectively ; Fig 6E , F ) . These data indicate that S1589 phosphorylation does not appreciably alter the binding surface of R8 , but does have a potentially significant change in binding of KANK to R7 .

Binding affinities were measured by fluorescence polarization . Dissociation constants ± SE ( μM ) for the interactions are indicated . The stability and positioning of the R7 and R8 domains is maintained by an extensive network of hydrogen bonds between the linkers connecting the two domains forming a two - stranded , anti - parallel ß - sheet - like structure ( 40 ) . As S1589 is located close to the linker between R7 and R8 , it was conceivable that the mechanosensitivity of this region may be altered by CDK1 - dependent phosphorylation . To test whether post - translational modification of S1589 alters the mechanical stability of the domains , we used single molecule unfolding experiments using magnetic tweezers ( Fig . 7A ) . Our previous study of the mechanical response of talin showed that , when exposed to mechanical force , the R7R8 double domain unfolds cooperatively with a single unfolding step of ~ 80 nm at ~ 15 pN force at a force loading rate of ~ 3 . 4 pN s - 1 ( 44 ) . To further characterise the mechanical properties of R7R8 , single molecule unfolding experiments were conducted for an R7R8 construct at loading rates of 1 . 0 ± 0 . 1 and 5 . 0 ± . 5 pN s - 1 . Consistent with our previous report ( 44 ) , a cooperative unfolding event was observed indicated by a single height - jump step of ~ 70 nm at a force of ~ 14 pN ( Fig 7B ) . The normalised unfolding force distributions of R7R8 at force loading rates of 1 ± 0 . 1 pN s - 1 and 5 ± 0 . 5 pN s - 1 peaked at 13 . 3 ± 1 . 6 pN and 14 . 5 ± 1 . 9 pN , respectively . Next , similar force - increase scans were performed with a single molecule construct containing R7 alone ( Fig 7C ) . In this case , the unfolding forces of the R7 domain were 10 . 1 ± 1 . 9 pN and 11 . 2 ± 1 . 1 pN for 1 ± 0 . 1 pN s - 1 and 5 ± 0 . 5 pN s - 1 , respectively ( Fig 7C ) , demonstrating that the R7 domain is mechanically weaker than R7R8 . As it has already been demonstrated that R8 is mechanically weak ( 44 , 45 ) , these findings indicate that the interdomain interaction between R7 and R8 is mutually stabilising . Next , to investigate how phosphorylation might affect the mechanical stability of R7R8 , a phosphomimetic single molecule construct of R7R8 containing S1589D ( referred as R7R8 S1589D ) was generated . The unfolding force of R7R8 S1589D peaked at 9 . 7 ± 1 . 5 pN and 10 . 0 ± 1 . 5 pN for 1 ± 0 . 1 pN s - 1 and 5 ± 0 . 5 pN s - 1 , respectively , and was significantly reduced compared to WT R7R8 ( Fig 7D ) . Furthermore , R7R8 S1589D and R7 had similar mechanical stabilities . These results demonstrate that phosphorylation of S1589 weakens the mechanical stability of this region likely by disrupting the interdomain connection of R7 and R8 .

Discussion Much of our current understanding of cell cycle regulation stems from studies on unicellular organisms , and less is known about the mechanisms coordinating cell division in the extracellular matrix - containing tissues of multicellular organisms . Here , our principal discovery is that there is a direct binding interaction between the master cell cycle regulator , CDK1 , and talin , a large mechanosensitive , actin - binding protein that plays a key role in regulating integrin - mediated cell adhesion to extracellular matrices . We have employed biochemical and structural approaches to define the binding mechanism , and demonstrate that a helical , talin - binding LD motif in CDK1 engages the talin rod R8 helical bundle . A CDK1 - 2A mutation , which disrupts the LD motif , impedes the assembly of IACs . Talin also contains a functional consensus CDK1 phosphorylation motif centred on S1589 , which regulates the mechanical responsiveness of the region , and thereby potentially alters downstream mechanotransduction pathways . We hypothesise that CDK1 binding to the talin scaffold could be a driver of the major morphological changes in adhesion seen during cell cycle progression and division , and that this constitutes an evolutionary adaptation of the cell cycle that is fundamental to multicellularity . Although we demonstrate that the talin - CDK1 interaction is required for CDK1 - dependent regulation of IACs during the cell cycle , a more detailed understanding of the mechanisms underlying this effect remains to be elucidated . For example , the talin - CDK1 interaction might regulate phosphorylation of multiple adhesome components , thereby contributing to IAC dynamics and downstream signalling pathways . The talin R8 domain is a nexus for multiple binding interactions ; thus , it binds DLC1 ( 33 , 46 ) , RIAM ( 17 , 47 ) and paxillin ( 33 ) , which modulate various aspects of cell spreading and migration , raising the possibility that competing interactions might provide a novel regulatory axis . The unique structure of the R7R8 region , in which the R8 helical bundle is inserted into the R7 helical bundle , means that R8 is shielded from force , unfolding only when R7 unfolds at ~ 14 pN applied force ( 44 , 45 ) . R8 therefore retains its ability to form helical addition interactions with LD motif - containing proteins even when flanking talin domains have unfolded under the forces exerted at sites of adhesion . The R7R8 region also provides linkages between IACs and the cytoskeleton , and it connects to both the actin and microtubule networks ( Fig 7 ) . Specifically , the R7 domain binds the KANK family of proteins ( 35 , 48 ) , which link to the cortical microtubule stabilising complex , and the R8 domain forms part of the actin binding site 2 ( ABS2 ) that makes strong , tension - bearing linkages to the actin cytoskeleton ( 23 , 36 ) . The R7R8 domains are stabilised by a ladder of hydrogen bonds between the linkers adjoining the two domains ( 40 ) , which makes the double domain one of the more stable regions in the group III ( 15 - 21 pN ) of talin rod domains ( 44 ) . The S1589D phosphomimetic R7R8 mutant is more susceptible to force , and unfolds at ~ 10 pN . This raises the possibility that CDK1 binding to , and phosphorylation of , the R7R8 region might regulate the association of talin with other IAC components and the cytoskeleton . The accessibility of the VBS in R8 has recently been shown to facilitate maturation of nascent adhesions ( 49 ) , suggesting that phosphorylation of S1589 during the cell cycle might also regulate adhesion dynamics by controlling the availability of this helix . The talin binding site on CDK1 also binds to the CKS proteins that regulate CDK1 function ( 39 ) . Therefore , talin and CKS interactions with CDK1 should be mutually exclusive . It is possible that the part of the CDK1 catalytic domain that binds to talin and CKS is a CDK1 - targetting domain , and its interactions with various proteins relocate CDK1 to cellular compartments where it can exert its effects . In addition , mutating the CDK1 LD motif leads to a loss of CDK1 phosphorylation at T161 , suggesting that this motif plays a key role in upstream regulation of CDK1 function . Therefore , investigating how binding partners of CDK1 - WT and CDK1 - 2A differ could elucidate key CDK1 regulatory mechanisms . Binding of CDK1 to cyclin A requires prior phosphorylation of T161 , whereas binding of CDK1 to cyclin B occurs without this phosphorylation ( 50 ) , and we demonstrate that CDK1 - 2A is still able to associate effectively with cyclin B , but is unable to complex with cyclin A . Thus , the CDK1 - 2A mutant may prove to be a useful tool for distinguishing the different roles of CDK1 - cyclin A and CDK1 - cyclin B during cell cycle progression . In this context , expression of CDK1 - 2A leads to a reduction in IACs and loss of IAC growth during S phase , processes that we have previously attributed to CDK1 - cyclin A , implying its utility in elucidating the mechanisms by which CDK1 - cyclin A modifies IACs and the cytoskeleton . Figure 8 : A cartoon to show how CDK1 regulation of talin mechanical response might orchestrate global rearrangements of the cells cytoskeleton . Talin ( white ) acts as a Mechanosensitive Signalling Hub that coordinates multiple cytoskeletal connections including microtubules ( green ) , mediated via KANK ( pink ) and the cortical microtubule stabilising complex ( CMSC ; orange ) and actin ( red ) , both directly and indirectly via vinculin ( green ) . The cell signalling of each integrin adhesion complex will be dependent on the conformational patterns of the talin binary switch domains and the cytoskeletal connections . The R7R8 region of talin serves as a nexus between the integrin adhesion complexes , microtubules and actin filaments . CDK1 ( blue ) binding to , phosphorylating , and altering the mechanical response of the R7R8 domains has the potential to alter these cytoskeletal linkages which might trigger global cytoskeletal rearrangement . The observation that CDK1 - dependent phosphorylation of talin at S1589 alters the mechanical sensitivity of R7R8 has implications for the role of talin as a mechanosensitive signalling hub ( 27 ) . This paradigm is based on the concept that the talin scaffold that connects integrins to the cytoskeleton can adopt many different conformations as a result of its binary switch patterns . These binary switches enable the cell to alter its behaviour in response to signalling , but also based on prior events , imbuing the cell with mechanical memory ( 51 ) . The highly reproducible response of talin to mechanical force is due to each of the talin switch domains having different mechanical responses to force ( 44 ) , and recruiting different signalling molecules as a function of force . The phosphorylation of S1589 by CDK1 may therefore alter the order that the talin switch domains unfold ( Fig . 7 ) . As further speculation , the concept of mechanical computation of the cell ( 51 ) , in which the entire cytoskeletal architecture functions as a computational assembly , predicts that cell architecture is dictated by the signals that the cell has received and the current patterns of mechanical switches in the cells . Alteration of this pattern by talin S1589 phosphorylation might lead to global changes to mechanotransduction downstream of talin . It may be that talin signalling , mechanotransduction via mechanical linkages , and information storage in binary switches are controlled by PTMs across many different tissues and scenarios . In this context , cell polarity is a key driver of tissue self - organisation and coupling cell division to the geometry and mechanics of the cytoskeletal machinery may provide a means of regulating the polarity and organisation of cells into tissues that underpins multicellularity . Prior to division , most cells are attached to an underlying ECM via IACs , and / or to neighbouring cells . While modulation of adhesion occurs during interphase to enable mitotic cell rounding and physical separation of daughter cells , the links between the cell cycle and cell adhesion are poorly understood . The novel interaction between talin and CDK1 identified in this report provides a framework for understanding these linkages . Our studies demonstrate that CDK1 is able to phosphorylate talin and switch talin into a state with different mechanical properties , potentially altering the talin interactome and function in IACs . As talin is central to the downstream events emanating from integrins , its interaction with CDK1 may enable large - scale , synchronised changes to cell architecture to be enabled during cell cycle progression and other adhesion - related processes such as cell migration . Furthermore , it is conceivable that changes in ECM stiffness sensed by talin may impact upon CDK1 activity and function , providing a direct , primordial link between mechanosensing and the induction of cell proliferation . Defining the changes in the talin and CDK1 interactomes that result from CDK1 - talin binding , and the knock - on consequences for adhesion and cell cycle signalling will be a priority .

Membranes were blocked for 60 min at RT using 5 % ( w / v ) BSA in TBS ( 10 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 4 , and 150 mM NaCl ) containing 0 . 05 % ( w / v ) Tween - 20 ( TBST ) and then probed overnight with primary antibodies diluted in 5 % ( w / v ) BSA / TBST at 4°C . Membranes were washed for 30 min by using TBST and then incubated with the appropriate fluorophore - conjugated secondary antibody diluted in 5 % ( w / v ) BSA / TBST for 45 min at RT in the dark . Membranes were washed for 30 min in the dark by using TBST and then scanned by using the Odyssey infrared imaging system ( LI - COR Biosciences ) In vitro kinase assay Purified recombinant GST - tagged CDK1 - cyclin A2 and His 6 - tagged CDK1 - cyclin B1 ( Invitrogen ) were stored in 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 5 mM EDTA , 0 . 01 % ( v / v ) Triton X - 100 , 2 mM DTT , 20 % ( v / v ) glycerol 20 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 . 30 ng of each protein was mixed with 0 . 1 µg of substrate ( talin R7R8 ) and incubated in 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM EDTA , 5 mM DTT , 25 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 02 % ( v / v ) Triton X - 100 , 1 mM ATP , 50 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 4 at 30 °C with shaking at 100 rpm for 20 min . The reaction was stopped by adding SDS sample buffer and boiled at 95 ° C for 10 min . A gradient SDS - PAGE 4 - 12 % Bis - Tris gel ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) was loaded with the entire sample and run at 200 V for 45 min . in 1x SDS running buffer ( NuPAGE ) . After western blotting , anti - phosphorylated CDK substrate antibody ( Cell Signalling Technology ) was used to probe the reactions . Phosphorylation site analysis Phosphorylation sites of talin - 1 R7R8 and talin - 2 R7R8 were determined using mass spectrometry . The in vitro kinase assay was carried out with the substrates talin - 1 R7R8 , talin - 2 R7R8 and CDK1 - cyclinA2 . Reactions was carried out for 45 min . at 30 °C and stopped by adding SDS sample buffer and boiling for 10 min at 95 °C . All samples were loaded onto an SDS PAGE 4 - 12 % Bis - Tris gel ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) and separated by running at 200 V for 60 min . Gels were stained with Instant - Blue ( Expedeon ) for 15 min , and washed in water overnight at 4°C . The talin R7R8 bands were cut from the gel and processed by in - gel tryptic digestion . Peptides were analysed by LC - MS / MS by using an UltiMate 3000 Rapid Separation LC ( Dionex Corporation ) coupled to an Orbitrap Elite MS ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . Peptides were separated on a bridged ethyl hybrid C18 analytical column ( 250 mm × 75 µm internal diameter , 1 . 7 µm particle size ; Waters ) over a 45 min gradient from 8 to 33 % ( v / v ) acetonitrile in 0 . 1 % ( v / v ) formic acid . LC - MS / MS analyses were operated in data - dependent mode to automatically select peptides for fragmentation by collision - induced dissociation . Multistage activation was enabled to fragment product ions resulting from neutral loss of phosphoric acid . Quantification was performed using Progenesis LC - MS / MS software . Single molecule stretching All single molecule stretching experiments were performed using magnetic tweezers ( 61 – 63 ) in standard buffered solution comprising PBS , 1 % ( w / v ) bovine serum albumin , 2 mM dithiothreitol , 10 mM sodium L - ascorbate at 21 ± 1 o C . The height of the target molecule - tethered superparamagnetic bead from the coverslip surface was recorded . At a constant applied force , the bead height change was the same as the molecule extension change ( 64 ) . During linear force - increase / force - decrease scans with typical loading rates of 0 . 1 to 10 pN s - 1 , the stepwise bead height change was the same as the stepwise extension change of the molecule . Over the time window of the stepwise transition event ( ≤0 . 01 s , the temporal resolution of this setup ) , the force change ( ≤0 . 001 to 0 . 1 pN ) was negligible . Force calibration of the magnetic tweezer has ~ 10 % uncertainty due to the heterogeneity of the paramagnetic beads ( 61 ) . Each single molecule protein construct contained a biotinylated AviTag at its N - terminus , a target domain spanned between four repeats of titin I27 domains , and a SpyTag at its C - terminus ( 65 ) . Between each two neighbouring molecular components in the construct , a short linker , GGGSG , was included to ensure flexibility of the components . The C - terminus of the protein construct was specifically attached to a SpyCatcher - coated coverslip surface ( Paul Marienfield ) , and the N - terminus of the construct was attached to a biotinylated DNA - coated paramagnetic bead ( 2 . 8 µ m diameter , Invitrogen ) via a biotin - neutravidin interaction . The four repeats of I27 domains and the DNA handle acted as a molecular spacer to avoid non - specific bead - surface interactions . The I27 domain has an ultra - high mechanical stability in that it typically unfolds at > 100 pN with a characteristic step size of ~ 24 nm at force loading rates 1 - 5 pN s - 1 ( 66 ) . Hence it can be distinguished from the target domain unfolding signals and does not affect the probing and characterisation of the target domains .
