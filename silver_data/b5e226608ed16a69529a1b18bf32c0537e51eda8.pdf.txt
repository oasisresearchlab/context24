We were asked to define vaccine coverage thresholds for transition through the stages of Australia’s ’National Plan’ to easing restrictions and reopening international borders . 17 18 19 20 Methods 21 Using available evidence of vaccine effectiveness against the then - circulating Delta variant , we used a mathematical model to determine vaccine coverage targets . The absence of any COVID - 19 infections in many sub - national jurisdictions in Australia posed particular methodological challenges for modelling in this setting . We used a novel metric called Transmission Potential ( TP ) as a proxy measure of the population - level effective reproduction number . We estimated TP of the Delta variant under a range of PHSMs , test - trace - isolate - quarantine ( TTIQ ) efficiencies , vaccination coverage thresholds , and age - based vaccine allocation strategies . 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 Findings 29 We found that high coverage of vaccination across all age groups ( ≥ 70 % ) combined with ongoing TTIQ and minimal PHSMs was sufficient to avoid strict lockdowns . At lesser coverage ( ≤ 60 % ) rapid case escalation risked overwhelming of the health sector and would prompt a need to reimpose strict restrictions , with substantive economic impacts in order to achieve the goals of the National Plan . Maintaining low case numbers was the most beneficial strategy for health and the economy , and at higher coverage levels ( ≥ 80 % ) further easing of restrictions was deemed possible . 30 31 32 33 34 35 Interpretation 36 These results reinforced recommendations from other modelling groups that some level of PHSMs should be continued to minimise the burden of the Delta variant following achievement of high population vaccine coverage .

INTRODUCTION 47 Since early 2020 , rapid dissemination of SARS - CoV - 2 and subsequent emergence of variants have resulted 48 in multiple rapidly escalating waves of infection with devastating impacts on health , society and the 49 economy [ 1 ] . In contrast with the rest of the world , many island nations in the Western Pacific Region 50 remained relatively COVID free through the first two years of the pandemic as a result of strong border 51 controls to prevent importation , and reactive imposition of social restrictions to constrain community 52 transmission ( e . g . [ 2 , 3 ] ) . These measures enabled enviable social freedoms and ongoing economic 53 activity , but such disconnection from the international community was not a sustainable strategy over the 54 longer term [ 4 ] . 55 Global concerted efforts to accelerate development and licensure of safe and effective vaccines raised 56 hopes that wide scale population immunisation would enable a return to ‘life as normal’ in high burden 57 settings , given demonstrated impacts on infection acquisition and onward spread [ 5 , 6 , 7 ] . For countries 58 that had pursued a low or zero - COVID strategy , ‘living with COVID’ seemed an achievable goal if 59 vaccines could constrain transmission and mitigate disease outcomes sufficiently to avoid overwhelming 60 the health system following SARS - CoV - 2 importation , while maintaining near normal societal functioning 61 [ 8 , 9 ] . However , anticipating the likely impacts of introducing COVID - 19 into an environment without 62 established SARS - CoV - 2 transmission is difficult [ 10 ] . 63 To address this challenge , we developed a Transmission Potential ( TP ) [ 10 ] metric to quantify the 64 likely spread of COVID in populations based on behavioural , social mixing data and available case 65 data . TP is an estimate of the average population - level trend in the effective reproduction number ( R ef f ) 66 and is driven by factors that influence transmission from local cases . Relevant considerations include 67 the effectiveness of test - trace - isolate - quarantine ( TTIQ ) case and contact management [ 11 ] , as well as 68 changes in personal distancing behaviour and mandated constraints on mixing group sizes , collectively 69 termed public health and social measures ( PHSMs ) [ 10 ] . Demonstrated reductions in TP achieved by 70 these interventions can be incorporated into future scenario projections , along with anticipated impacts 71 of vaccination on transmission [ REF vaccination efficacy / TP paper ] . International evidence of vaccine 72 effectiveness against acquisition and onward spread of the Delta variant was used to estimate the likely 73 overlaid impact of differing levels of vaccine coverage ( by age cohort ) on population wide TP . 74 This approach was used in mid - 2021 to help inform Australia’s National Plan to transition Australia’s 75 National COVID - 19 response [ 12 ] , by determining target vaccination thresholds for moving between its 76 four phases ( table 1 ) , including any ongoing requirement for public health responses and social measures . 77 These methods formed the basis for further collaborative work with the Australian Government Treasury 78 to determine likely economic implications of reopening at alternative thresholds based on the level of 79 adjunct PHSMs needed [ 13 ] , and constituted part of a broader suite of modelling advice to the Australian 80 Government to inform management of the pandemic and a shift away from strict lockdown measures 81 [ 14 , 15 , 16 ] . From the outset , it was anticipated that reopening targets in populations na¨ıve to COVID - 19 82 would be higher than for those with a history of prior circulation resulting in some degree of established 83 immunity to the virus . 84 METHODS 85 Transmission Potential 86 Transmission potential ( TP ) is a measure of the average potential for a virus to spread at the population 87 level [ 10 ] . It can be considered as an estimate of the reproduction number , if transmission were widespread 88 ( and therefore not concentrated in one demographic group with non - representative transmission rates ) . The 89 base model consists of three sub - models involving time to detection and isolation of cases , and two types 90 of physical distancing behaviour : we differentiate “macro - distancing” as the reduction in the average rate 91 of non - household contacts ( e . g . in response to lockdown - type restrictions ) , while “micro - distancing” is the 92 reduction in transmission probability per non - household contact ( e . g . adherence to social - distancing and 93 hygiene advice or legislation ; [ 10 ] ) . Transmission potential will vary among communities by differential 94 average household size and age structures , and can be modulated by changes to behaviour through public 95 health and social measures , time to detection and isolation of cases , and immunity through infection 96 and vaccination .

Phases of the “National Plan to transition Australia’s National COVID - 19 Response” [ 12 ] . Our modelling analysis focuses on the transition from ‘phase A’ in which strong suppression and no community transmission is the goal , to ‘phase B’ where vaccine coverage is high and SARS - CoV - 2 infection is allowed to establish in the population . Scenarios therefore examine the epidemic dynamics and clinical consequences of infections following seeding of an epidemic at different vaccination coverage thresholds achieved through alternative age prioritisation strategies . Phase Description Activities A Vaccinate , Prepare and Pilot Continue to strongly suppress the virus for the purpose of minimising community transmission B Vaccination Transition Seek to minimise serious illness , hospitalisation and fatality as a result of COVID - 19 C Vaccination Consolidation As above D Post - Vaccination Manage COVID - 19 consistent with public health man - agement of other infectious diseases below we explain and test how varying and adding components can modulate TP . Whilst an estimate of 98 transmission potential under a given scenario of R 0 , behaviour , and health system performance can never 99 be a perfect predictor of a reproduction number due to epidemic stochasticity and unaccounted sources 100 of variation , it is a measure that enables prediction of the likely ability to control spread in the event of 101 widespread transmission , and has been used as a systematically reported situational assessment metric in 102 Australia since 2020 [ 17 , 18 , 19 ] . 103 Test , Trace , Isolate , and Quarantine 104 Test - trace - isolate - quarantine ( TTIQ ) strategies are key non - pharmaceutical interventions used globally 105 to manage infectious disease outbreaks [ 20 , 21 ] including frequently during the COVID - 19 pandemic 106 [ 22 , 23 ] . TTIQ operates through isolating cases identified by testing , and tracing and pre - emptive 107 quarantining of their close contacts to prevent further onward transmission . We adapted our TP model 108 to include an explicit effect of reducing the time to case isolation achievable through intensive contact 109 tracing , in addition to the time to case detection effect already included [ 11 ] . The empirical distribution of 110 times from symptom onset to case isolation under an ‘optimal’ TTIQ capacity ( i . e . with a health system 111 that had enough capacity to rapidly contact trace all cases ) was estimated using a limited time series of 112 case data from the state of New South Wales between July 2020 and January 2021 , for which dates of 113 isolation were known with a high level of data completeness . This distribution was then calibrated to 114 estimate the distribution of times to isolation in other times and states by assuming improvements in TTIQ 115 are proportional to improvements in times to detection . We characterised a second level of ‘partially’ 116 efficacious TTIQ based on observations from the state of Victoria on 4 August 2020 . This date was the 117 then - peak of daily locally - acquired COVID - 19 cases in Australia representing a contact - tracing system 118 under resource constraints . These data were used to estimate the effect of ‘partial’ TTIQ on transmission 119 potential to estimate a baseline TP under community transmission . These estimates of ‘optimal’ and 120 ‘partial’ TTIQ correspond to a 54 % and 42 % reduction in transmission respectively ; the full details of this 121 estimation are found in [ 11 ] . 122 Public Health and Social Measures 123 In the presence of ongoing viral transmission , it is necessary to keep the rate of virus reproduction , R ef f , 124 below or close to 1 , as any extended periods where R ef f > 1 can quickly lead to significant numbers of 125 cases , causing stressors on health systems . So maintenance of R ef f near or below 1 is needed both to 126 contain community transmission in the suppression phase , and to prevent cases from exceeding health 127 sector capacity after re - opening . Regulated or advised risk reduction behaviours and constraints on social 128 mixing described collectively as public health and social measures ( PHSMs ) are the levers that may be 129 employed to manage R ef f in response to incursions and outbreaks . Behaviours change over time either 130 spontaneously because of heightened concern or complacency , or in response to mandated public health 131 orders invoking various elements of PHSMs . 132 Here we investigated what level of PHSMs would be required to bring TP to near or below 1 under 133 different scenarios of vaccination coverage .

Each bundle is drawn 135 from a specific time and place in Australia’s pandemic experience , thereby capturing both real - world 136 behavioural responses and the proportional reduction in TP achievable by PHSMs in this context . They 137 therefore represent differing degrees of social constraints for which the impact on TP and economic 138 activity could be defined from historical observations . 139 Full descriptions of measures included in these bundles are in table S1 . These bundles are intended to 140 reflect the plausible behavioural consequences of different levels of stringency of PHSM . As such , the 141 ‘Baseline PHSM’ bundle reflects behaviours during a period with minimal restrictions , and a population 142 aware of the risk of COVID - 19 ( as opposed to behaviour prior to the pandemic ) . The other bundles reflect 143 the behavioural effects of increasing levels of stringency . We emphasise that the TPs associated with these 144 PHSM bundles reflect state wide population behaviours ( numbers of household contacts and adherence to 145 hygiene advice ) estimated at these times . TPs are observed to differ substantially over time and between 146 states , even within similar restrictions [ ? 18 ] . These periods are therefore intended to reflect achievable 147 levels of reduction in TP via PHSMs , rather than inference about the particular impacts of these sets of 148 restrictions . 149 Table 2 . Description of measures implemented under different ‘bundles’ of public health and social measures ( PHSMs ) . Each bundle relates to a specific time and place in Australia’s pandemic experience up to mid - 2021 — thereby capturing behavioural responses and the proportional reduction in TP achievable by PHSMs in the Australian context . The proportional reductions in TP observed at each time and place can therefore be related to similar reductions achieved via other combinations of PHSMs ( not limited to the ”bundles” in place during the reference period ) . Similarly , the imposition of any given combination of PHSMs at different times and places may result in variable population responses and thus reductions in TP . More detailed descriptions of the bundles can be found in S1 PHSM bundle Description Baseline Minimal density / capacity restrictions and no major outbreaks as in NSW March 2021 Low More stringent capacity restrictions compared to baseline ( e . g . , hospitality venues limited to 10 customers per booking ) , as in NSW 23 August 2020 Medium Stringent capacity restrictions , group size limits ( e . g . , fewer than five people outdoors ) , stay - at - home orders ( except work , study , essential purposes ) , as in NSW 1 July 2021 High No household visitors , curfew , stay - at - home orders ( except essential purposes and permitted work ) , schools closed ( remote learning only ) , as in VIC 23 August 2020 Age - structured Vaccination Impact on Transmission 150 In keeping with WHO guidance [ 24 ] and many other countries , Australia’s immunisation program initially 151 prioritised health - and aged - care workers , elderly populations and those at increased risk of transmission 152 and / or severe outcomes [ 25 ] . When defining overall target coverage thresholds for the eligible population , 153 an important goal was to consider the distribution of doses received across age categories . While older 154 individuals are more likely to experience severe disease outcomes , young and working adults are expected 155 to make a greater contribution to transmission at the population level . So to explore the effect of age - 156 structured vaccination on transmission , we explored four allocation strategies : oldest first , 40 + years first , 157 all adults , and transmission reducing , described in table 3 ( the specific percentages of each age - group 158 vaccinated in these strategies can be found in [ 16 ] ) . These strategies were motivated by being the strategy 159 in place at the time ( oldest first ) , and a series of what were considered the only other practical options . The 160 strategies followed the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration [ 26 , 27 ] and Australian Technical 161 Advisory Group on Immunisation [ 28 ] advice on which vaccines were administered to which age - groups 162 and the dosing interval between first and second doses 4 . We also assume a two week delay from 163 administration until a vaccine takes full effect 4 . 164 We estimated the percentage reduction in TP that could be expected under different vaccination 165 coverages and distributions by age , vaccine type , and the number of doses received , via static analysis of 166 an age - based transmission matrix , S2 , [ 29 ] .

TP will be 168 influenced by spontaneous and imposed changes in physical distancing behaviours , the number of social 169 contacts on average between individuals and the timeliness of TTIQ measures . We use a baseline TP of 170 3 . 6 for the Delta variant based on averaged observations from the state of New South Wales in March 171 2021 , a period with minimal social restrictions and no major outbreaks . 172 For each vaccination scenario , the reduction in transmission by age - group was calculated from the 173 average vaccination efficacy against transmission ( accounting for the fractions of each vaccine type and 174 number of doses in that age - group ) and the age - group coverage . Proportional reductions in transmission 175 rates for each age combination were then applied to the original ‘unvaccinated’ transmission matrix to 176 construct a ‘vaccinated’ matrix . The dominant eigenvalue , representing the population - wide reproduction 177 number was compared between these pairs of matrices to compute a percentage reduction in TP due to 178 immunisation . 179 To explore and visualise the effect of different strategies on TP reduction among age categories , we 180 also calculated an age - group specific TP prior to and after vaccination under a given scenario . These 181 ‘by - age’ contributions are calculated for a given homogeneous age - group ( whereas other TP calculations 182 use all age groups concurrently S2 ) . Because these age - specific TP calculations exclude interactions with 183 other age - groups , they are not equivalent to the partial contribution of that age group to the overall TP . 184 Table 3 . Vaccine allocation strategies and allocation sequence by age - group . The specific modelled percentages of each age - group vaccinated in these strategies can be found in [ 16 ] . Strategy Allocation sequence Oldest first Vaccinations are prioritised from oldest to youngest . Specifically , priori - tization occurs in the following order : 80 + , 70 - 79 , 60 - 69 , 50 - 59 , 40 - 49 , 30 - 39 , 20 - 29 , 16 - 19 40 + years first Vaccinations are prioritised from 40 + upwards , then 16 + . Specifically , prioritization occurs in the following order : 40 - 49 , 50 - 59 , 60 - 69 , 70 - 79 , 80 + , 16 - 19 , 20 - 29 , 30 - 39 All adults Vaccinations are not prioritised in any particular order by age Transmissionreducing As for national program , under which all individuals 40 + were eligible as at the 12 th of July 2021 . Within the simulation time - frame , the 30 - 39 years cohort becomes eligible from the 30 th of August 2021 , and 16 - 29 years on the 11 th of October . Time in Lockdown 185 During outbreak suppression in Australia , early and stringent lockdowns were used to bring TP below 1 186 for the purposes of driving even a handful of local cases from an outbreak to zero , in the context of an 187 optimal TTIQ response . The goal of transitioning to phase B 1 was to minimise the requirement for such 188 stringent PHSMs , restricting their use to meet the explicit objective of prevention of overwhelming the 189 health sector in the face of escalating case loads . 190 Ongoing application of some degree of social measures through this phase to support vaccine impacts 191 reduces the likelihood for high restrictions and preserves TTIQ effectiveness by keeping case numbers 192 low . TP estimates with and without stringent PHSM can be used to calculate the approximate proportion 193 of time those stringent measures would need to be in place to prevent exceedance of health sector capacity 194 over a defined time frame . This simple static analysis can indicate the plausible societal and economic 195 impacts of the PHSM required to constrain transmission under each scenario and coverage . 196 Where a vaccination scenario leads to either a TP 1 > 1 with one PHSM bundle and TP 2 < 1 with 197 a more stringent bundle , the long - term average TP can be maintained at 1 , i . e . with daily case counts 198 Table 4 .

This fraction of 201 time under more stringent PHSMs is independent of the sequence or duration of the periods under more 202 stringent restrictions ; a strategy of rapid switching on and off of restrictions , or one of alternating long 203 periods with or without restrictions would both lead to long - term maintenance of TP = 1 , provided the 204 fraction of time in each condition is the same S1 . 205 Switching between more and less stringent PHSMs reflects a strategy that might be used to keep cases 206 below a health sector capacity limit in the event that there is long - term community transmission . With the 207 the necessary simplifying assumption that vaccination coverage is static , where one PHSM bundle leads 208 to growing cases numbers ( TP 1 > 1 ) , and a second bundle leads to contracting case numbers ( TP 2 < 1 ) , 209 we can calculate the fraction of time necessary under each bundle of PHSMs S1 . However this strategy 210 will not always be either necessary or possible . When cases under both bundles lead to declining case 211 numbers ( i . e . TP 1 < 1 and TP 2 < 1 ) , the fraction is zero as the more stringent PHSM bundle is not needed . 212 Alternatively , where even the more stringent PHSMs still lead to growing daily case numbers ( TP 2 > 1 ) 213 no fraction exists , because even the more stringent PHSM bundle could not control transmission . 214 Costs of PHSMs 215 The Australian Government Treasury estimated the direct economic costs of alternative COVID - 19 216 management scenarios explored in this analysis . Estimates included the expected average weekly costs 217 of activity restrictions and lockdowns for each of the bundled levels of restrictions , multiplied by their 218 duration of application over the specified timeframe . These figures were derived by analysing the impact 219 on hours worked across the economy during lockdown periods in 2020 , compared with the pre - COVID 220 baseline . They did not include indirect confidence effects , labour market impacts , social , fiscal or health 221 economic costs . For all scenarios it was assumed that case numbers would be constrained by social 222 measures to avoid overwhelming the health system . An objective of maintaining low case numbers in this 223 way was to avoid the significant behavioural changes and related economic impacts that were observed 224 in other country settings where severe and widespread outbreaks occurred in the absence of mixing 225 restrictions .

R code to reproduce these analyses are available 228 at https : / / github . com / aus - covid - modelling / NationalCabinetModelling . This 229 code uses outputs from regular situational assessment work [ 19 , 18 ] that are conducted using data provided 230 under confidential agreement from the Australian Commonwealth Government ( see also statement in 231 Ethics ) , and that the authors are not authorised to make available . Code to create figures 3 and S1 can be 232 found in [ 32 ] . 233 RESULTS 234 From an R 0 of 8 for the Delta variant , with baseline PHSMs and partial TTIQ in place TP is reduced 235 to 3 . 6 , which serves as a baseline to which other interventions are added 1 . The effects of vaccination 236 and more stringent PHSMs on TP are mathematically multiplicative , so the results displayed in figure 1 237 use a logarithmic y - axis in order to easily see the relative magnitude of each intervention . The results 238 demonstrate that as vaccination coverage increases , less stringent PHSMs are required to bring TP 239 below 1 and thus control epidemic activity ( figure 1 ) . Maintaining a rapid and highly effective TTIQ 240 response capacity is critical for ongoing epidemic control . Should TTIQ responses become only partially 241 effective due to high caseloads , high PHSM would be needed to curb transmission at the 50 % and 242 60 % coverage thresholds , whilst low PHSMs may be sufficient for control at 80 % coverage ( figure 243 1 ) . More optimistically , the combination of 70 % vaccine coverage and ongoing low PHSMs would 244 likely be sufficient for control , if optimal TTIQ can be maintained ( figure 1 ) . Note that compliance with 245 imposed measures will vary their effectiveness between populations and time - points . This uncertainty is 246 conceptually represented by the upper and lower bounds of each ‘box’ for each set of restrictions in figure 247 1 . 248 The choice of age - structured vaccine allocation strategy has a slight effect on Transmission Potential , 249 though this varies with level of vaccine coverage ( table 5 ) .

Vaccinating the 40 + years first tended to perform 253 worst at lower levels of coverage , requiring the largest proportion of time under strict PHSMs , however 254 this became unimportant at higher levels of vaccination . 255 Tables 6 and 7 compare the proportion of time that would need to be spent with high PHSM on top 256 of ongoing light restrictions to maintain case counts at some level , by vaccine coverage and allocation 257 strategy . We assume periodic switching between low PHSM and high PHSM over a long period with 258 the same vaccination coverage . With long - term coverage held at 50 % , 60 % , or 70 % , high PHSM would 259 be needed for significant fractions of time ( 18 - 89 % ) if caseloads escalate , leading to ‘partial’ TTIQ 260 effectiveness . For the ‘optimal’ TTIQ scenario and an achieved adult population coverage of 70 % , high 261 PHSM would be needed rarely if at all . 262 Table 5 .

These combined outputs demonstrate the substantive cost savings associated with avoidance of 266 lockdown and provided additional justification for delaying reopening until achieving 70 % threshold 267 vaccine coverage . The overlay of some degree of social measures at this threshold supported transmission 268 reduction and helped to maintain the effectiveness of an active case finding strategy focused on minimising 269 health impacts . At 80 % coverage these restrictions could be eased without any envisaged lockdown 270 requirement . 271 DISCUSSION 272 This work formed the basis of a significant contribution to easing of COVID - 19 restrictions in Australia 273 in late 2021 by providing a structured framework to explore the effect of management decisions on 274 transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 in Australia based on contemporary evidence [ 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 ] . Specifically , 275 it covers the pandemic period up to mid - late 2021 , during which time the Delta variant became established 276 in several eastern Australian states resulting in imposition of stringent lockdowns to manage transmission 277 and clinical burden , and closure of interstate borders . For those states , our recommendation of a target 278 vaccination level of at least 70 % 1 was a pathway out of restrictions and a way to reconnect with ‘COVID - 279 zero’ jurisdictions . In the other states , high vaccine coverage provided confidence that COVID - 19 impacts 280 could be mitigated sufficiently to avoid substantive health system and social disruption , and at 80 % 281 coverage only minimal social and behavioural measures would be required to support vaccination 1 . 282 The scenarios in this study representing a single national COVID - 19 epidemic were clearly ( and 283 deliberately ) artificial and served to inform high level policy strategy . Beyond defining threshold vaccine 284 targets , they highlighted the importance of a combination of timely public health responses ( TTIQ ) 285 and ongoing social and behavioural measures ( PHSMs ) to constrain SARS - CoV - 2 transmission . It was 286 recognised that at high caseloads , maintenance of optimal TTIQ was likely infeasible . In such instances , 287 jurisdictions retained the flexibility to strengthen PHSMs generally or locally ( as envisaged in the National 288 Plan [ 12 ] ) to regain local epidemic control 3 . The required intensity and duration of measures was to be 289 informed by ongoing situational assessment of transmission and its related health impacts [ 19 ] . 290 In August 2021 when these analyses were first reported , evidence of vaccine efficacy against acquisi - 291 tion and onward spread of infection had raised hopes that equitable vaccine distribution could substantially 292 This is a draft and has not yet been peer reviewed or published 9 / 24 .

Percentage of time necessary under PHSMs to constrain outbreaks ( a ) and cost ( in millions of Australian dollars per week ) of the least expensive PHSM bundle able to constrain outbreaks ( b ) under each combination of TTIQ effectiveness and ongoing PHSMs , at 50 , 60 , 70 , and 80 % vaccination coverage of the 16 + adult population , and an ”All adults” vaccine allocation scenario . Data in ( a ) from S2 , S3 , S4 , and S5 , and ( b ) from [ 13 ] limit global transmission and burden of COVID - 19 disease [ 33 ] . However , studies undertaken by multiple 293 modelling groups supporting decision making to ease UK lockdowns during the Delta era similarly 294 cautioned against the lifting of all restrictions ( ‘freedom day’ ) following achievement of vaccine targets , 295 given imperfect vaccine protection and potential for resurgence [ 34 ] . In support of this position , a rapid 296 rebound of Delta infections following reopening in the Netherlands had necessitated re - imposition of 297 social measures within only weeks of easing . At that time , global concern about driving emergence 298 of further variants remained high and strong suppression strategies were favoured by the World Health 299 Organisation [ 35 ] . 300 Our findings were aligned with and benchmarked against the UK modelling reports , including the 301 recommendation for ongoing social constraints , but were novel in two main aspects . For the majority 302 of Australian jurisdictions , relaxation of border restrictions would allow importation of infections into 303 ‘COVID - zero’ settings , requiring high confidence in model recommendations . The use of transmission 304 potential as a novel metric enabled anticipation of case loads in settings where there were presently none 305 [ 10 ] . Given ongoing global discussions about competing health and economic impacts of COVID - 19 and 306 social measures for its control [ 36 ] , the accompanying Treasury analyses were highly influential in whole 307 of government decision making . We are unaware of similar publicly available estimates of the costs of 308 PHSMs under different levels of vaccine coverage from other country settings . 309 The model assumed fixed efficacy of vaccine protection against transmission and disease at a single 310 time point and did not incorporate waning immunity . At the time of analysis , longevity of population 311 experience with COVID - 19 vaccines was limited and evidence of the rate of loss of protection was sparse . 312 Israel was the first country to approve booster doses on July 30 2021 , initially for individuals aged 60 and 313 above . This recommendation was prompted by observation of breakthrough infections following primary 314 vaccination consistent with waning immunity [ 37 ] . Booster requirements were then a contentious issue , 315 with many arguing that broad provision of a third vaccine dose was unnecessary in highly immunised 316 populations . There were particular concerns about impacts on supply for global vaccine equity , given 317 persistently low primary vaccine coverage and access in many low and middle income countries [ 38 ] . 318 This is a draft and has not yet been peer reviewed or published 10 / 24 .

These metrics were not sufficient to calculate the likely morbidity and mortality outcomes of 321 COVID - 19 under specific rollout strategies and changes given the dynamic nature of vaccination and 322 transmission . Related work extended our initial findings on transmission potential into an agent based 323 model framework to estimate those impacts and is reported elsewhere [ 39 ] . 324 It was further recognised that the national COVID - 19 epidemic had been , and would continue to 325 be , a ‘fire’ fought on multiple fronts across Australia’s geographically distributed population , largely 326 concentrated in coastal urban cities . We recommended that particular attention be paid to groups in whom 327 socioeconomic , cultural and other determinants were anticipated to result in higher transmission and / or 328 disease outcomes . In addition , achievements of vaccination targets at small area level was critical to 329 ensure equity of program impact , as ongoing outbreaks in under - vaccinated populations were considered 330 likely , and would need to be supported by optimisation of localised public health responses . These issues 331 were the focus of subsequent work [ 11 , 39 ] . 332 In reality , the applicability of these defined thresholds to reopening goals was made redundant by im - 333 portation and rapid transmission of the Omicron SARS - CoV - 2 variant in December 2021 . Dissemination 334 of this and subsequent immune escape variants has led to global reconsideration of the role of vaccination 335 in the control of COVID - 19 . Moreover , vaccine protection against severe disease appears more robust 336 and sustained than that against transmission , particularly in the context of waning post - immunisation 337 neutralising antibody titres ( REF ) . This emerging understanding has reoriented strategic vaccine use 338 towards promoting population resilience against severe disease outcomes , rather than transmission reduc - 339 tion . Subsequent work focuses on the implications of variant emergence for deployment of vaccines and 340 other control measures in the era of Omicron and beyond . 341 ETHICS 342 The study was undertaken as urgent public health action to support Australia’s COVID - 19 pandemic 343 response . The study used data from the Australian National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System 344 ( NNDSS ) provided to the Australian Government Department of Health under the National Health Security 345 Agreement for the purposes of national communicable disease surveillance . Data from the NNDSS were 346 supplied after de - identification to the investigator team for the purposes of provision of epidemiological 347 advice to government . Contractual obligations established strict data protection protocols agreed between 348 the University of Melbourne and sub - contractors and the Australian Government Department of Health , 349 with oversight and approval for use in supporting Australia’s pandemic response and for publication 350 provided by the data custodians represented by the Communicable Diseases Network of Australia . The 351 ethics of the use of these data for these purposes , including publication , was agreed by the Department of 352 Health with the Communicable Diseases Network of Australia . 353 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 354 This work forms part of a wider body of work around supporting Australia’s plan to reopen from COVID - 355 19 restrictions ( often known in media as ’the Doherty modelling’ ) . We thank our many colleagues who , 356 while largely locked in their homes , contributed to this large undertaking with unfailing good grace and 357 humour . 358 We also thank many colleagues at Treasury who helped advise and focus this work , in particular 359 including those contributing to [ 13 ] . 360 Thanks to David Price for helpful comments on the manuscript . 361 This work was directly funded by the Australian Government Department of Health Office of Health 362 Protection .

Whilst 548 the first PHSM bundle is in place cases will grow , and whilst the more stringent bundle is in place cases 549 will shrink , leading to an oscillation of case counts around some average level S1 . This reflects a strategy 550 that might be used to keep cases below a health sector capacity limit in the event that there is long - term 551 community transmission and under the necessary simplifying assumption that vaccination coverage is 552 static . 553 Where TP 1 > 1 and TP 2 < 1 , we can calculate the fraction of time spent under more stringent PHSMs as : fraction = − log ( TP 1 ) log ( TP 2 ) − log ( TP 1 ) ( S1 ) Where TP 1 < 1 the fraction is zero , and as the more stringent PHSM bundle is not needed . Where TP 2 > 1 554 no fraction exists , because even the more stringent PHSM bundle could not control transmission . 555 Note that this fraction of time under more stringent PHSMs is independent of the sequence or duration 556 of the periods under more stringent restrictions ; a strategy of rapid switching on and off of restrictions , or 557 one of alternating long periods with or without restrictions would both lead to long - term maintenance 558 of TP = 1 , provided the fraction of time in each condition is the same and that daily case numbers are 559 either growing or contracting exponentially ( i . e . , no significant susceptible depletion alters the growth 560 rate ) , e . g . S1 . However for practical reasons , a rapid switching between states is unlikely to be used . The 561 overall number of cases ( as opposed to the long - term average TP ) will however be dependant on the rate 562 of switching , but it is assumed in all calculations in this paper that switching is sufficient to maintain total 563 case numbers below a level which would result in overwhelming of the public healthcare system . 564 This is a draft and has not yet been peer reviewed or published 16 / 24 .

Example of how daily cases may fluctuate over time in response to stringency of PHSMs using 80 % vaccination coverage , partial TTIQ and reversion to baseline PHSMs , with either long or short intervals between switching PHSMs . In this example , to maintain a stable TP ≤ 1 over time requires strict PHSMs for ≥ 31 % of the time 3 , S2 . Starting with strict PHSMs as here results in cases fluctuating below the initial daily case number ( N 0 , dotted line ) . The length of intervals under respective PHSMs ( left vs . right ) will not alter the overall average TP ( though may affect total case numbers ) .

It has been expanded to include an 80 + age class ( assumed to have the same 567 mixing rates as 75 - 79 years ) S2 . Age - specific susceptibility and transmissibility estimates from [ 30 ] are 568 used and transmission rates have been calibrated to our baseline population - wide TP of 3 . 6 . 569 The greatest mixing intensities are anticipated between individuals aged from 15 - 24 years , remaining 570 high through adults of working age . While intense school - based mixing is anticipated between children 571 aged 5 - 14 , the transmission matrix accounts for the relatively low observed infectiousness of this age 572 group , associated with a high proportion of asymptomatic infections . 573 Figure S2 .
