Activation of JAK / STAT signaling by IFN - g requires parti - tioning of IFN - g R into specific lipid nanodomains at the plasma membrane . Using IFN - g R as a proxy , we investi - gated the role of actin dynamics in the formation and or - ganization of lipid nanodomains , a process that remains poorly understood . We identified formin Dia2 / DIAPH3 as a specific and RhoA - dependent regulator of IFN - g - induced JAK / STAT signaling . Based on lipidomics and specific probes enabling membrane lipid imaging by su - per resolution microscopy , we demonstrate that Dia2 is required for proper assembly of sphingomyelin and cho - lesterol lipid complexes . Finally , we show that the disor - ganization of lipid nanodomains induced by Dia2 deple - tion results in drastic changes in nano - partitioning and activity of other membrane proteins , such as Thy1 and PD - L1 . Our data establish , therefore , the central role of the RhoA - Dia2 axis in the regulation of IFN - g induced JAK / STAT signaling , and more broadly , in the nanoscale organization of the plasma membrane . receptor signaling | membrane lipid | formin | actin cytoskeleton Correspondence * : cedric . blouin @ curie . fr and christophe . lamaze @ curie . fr Introduction The spatio - temporal distribution and dynamics of lipids at the plasma membrane condition the lateral segregation of signal - ing receptors into functional nanodomains ( Rao & Mayor , 2014 ; Sezgin et al . , 2017 ) that play a key role in their activa - tion ( Levental & Lyman , 2023 ) . Receptor nano - partitioning is required for activation of T cell and B cell receptors ( Gold & Reth , 2019 ; Pathan - Chhatbar et al . , 2021 ) , interferon - γ recep - tor ( IFN - γ R ) ( Blouin et al . , 2016 ) , GPCRs ( Baccouch et al . , 2022 ) , integrins ( Kalappurakkal et al . , 2019 ) , and controls various cellular processes such as immune response , cell adhesion and cell survival ( Saha et al . , 2016 ) . Since the con - cept of lipid rafts was first proposed ( Simons & Ikonen , 1997 ) , there have been persistent controversies about the nature and function of the physical constraints that control the spa - tiotemporal diffusion and biological activity of plasma mem - brane components ( Sezgin et al . , 2017 ; Levental et al . , 2020 ) . Importantly , new technological developments , such as super - resolution microscopy , enhanced mass spectrometry and mo - lecular dynamics simulations have led to a recent revision of the original concept . Lipid rafts are now considered as highly dynamic nanoscale lipid - protein assemblies enriched with cholesterol and sphingolipids , and where receptors such as glycosylphosphatidylinositol - anchored proteins ( GPI - APs ) and cytokine transmembrane receptors are preferentially recruited ( Levental et al . , 2020 ; Murata et al . , 2022 ) . Besides that , the cortical actin cytoskeleton has been shown to influence mem - brane organization and determine molecular diffusion at the plasma membrane ( Jaqaman et al . 2011 ; Köster et al . , 2016 ; Fritzsche et al . , 2017 ; Kusumi et al . , 2023 ) . The actin - driven diffusion mechanism of membrane molecules can provide a valid explanation for the kinetic properties and non - equilibrium distribution of nanoclusters formed by multiple lipid or protein species . Nevertheless , the current paradigm of ordered lipid nanodomains still leaves us with several processes that are poorly understood , such as the identification of drivers for in - teractions between lipids , receptors , and actin within mem - brane nanodomains , and the role of these interactions in re - ceptor signal transduction and physiological functions . We demonstrated previously that the IFN - γ receptor ( IFN - γ R ) partitions into sphingomyelin ( SM ) and cholesterol ( Chol ) - dependent nanodomains , a process that is strictly required for IFN - γ R conformational changes and subsequent Janus kinas - es / Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription ( JAK / STAT ) signaling ( Blouin et al . , 2016 ) . Given the signifi - cant role of actin cytoskeleton in membrane organization , we sought to understand how it may be involved in the association of IFN - γ R with specific plasma membrane nanodomains and the regulation of JAK / STAT signaling . Formins have been shown to play a central role in the control of actin nucleation and elongation . They are involved in several cellular process - es , including filopodia and lamellipodia formation ( Schirenbeck et al . , 2005 , Block et al . , 2012 ) , cytokinesis ( Buracco et al . , 2019 ) , and phagocytic cups formation ( Brandt et al . , 2007 ) . The formin family groups 15 formin genes in placental mam - mals which can be categorized into seven subtypes ( Cour - temanche , 2018 ) : Diaphanous ( DIAPH / Dia ) , Dishevelled - Associated Activator of Morphogenesis ( DAAM ) , Formin - Related gene in Leukocytes ( FRL ) , Formin Homology Domain - containing Protein ( FHOD ) , Inverted Formin ( INF ) , Formin like ( FMN ) protein , and Delphilin ( Kovar et al . , 2005 ) . The role of formins in actin nucleation and filament elongation has been extensively studied , but their specific role in the function of plasma membrane transmembrane receptors has not been extensively addressed . Recently , formins have been involved in the diffusion of GPI - APs and B cell receptor at the plasma membrane , ( Saha et al . , 2015 ; Kalappurakkal et al . , 2019 ; Rey - Suarez et al . , 2020 ) and in the formation of CD44 | bioR χ iv | 2 Li et al . nanoclusters ( Freeman et al . , 2018 ; Sil et al . , 2020 ) . Howev - er , the precise molecular mechanisms by which formins drive the formation of specific lipid nanodomains and possibly con - trol membrane receptor signaling remain largely elusive . We identified DIAPH3 / Dia2 , a member of the formin family , as an essential and specific regulator of IFN - γ - stimulated JAK / STAT signaling . Spot - variation fluorescence correlation spectroscopy ( svFCS ) revealed a drastic change of mem - brane receptor diffusion behavior upon Dia2 inhibition . Spin - ning - disk and single molecule localization microscopy respec - tively showed that Dia2 depletion decreased the amount of cholesterol - associated sphingomyelin ( SM / Chol complex ) at the plasma membrane and its nanoclustering . Furthermore , we identified RhoA as a major upstream regulator of Dia2 controlling IFN - γ R function . We next showed that the RhoA - Dia2 axis has a general impact on plasma membrane nano - organization , as evidenced by the perturbed diffusion of GPI - AP Thy - 1 in absence of Dia2 . Finally , we observed that Dia2 was important for both the cellular abundance and the protein stability of PD - L1 , another receptor controlled by its lipid envi - ronment at the plasma membrane . Altogether , our data demonstrate that the RhoA - Dia2 axis governs the formation of SM / Chol nanodomains that are required for proper mem - brane receptors nano - partitioning and function at the plasma membrane . Results Formin inhibitor SMIFH2 impairs IFN - γR - induced JAK / STAT signaling . IFN - γ is a pleiotropic cytokine that regulates many cellular functions and plays a key role in innate immunity but also a dual function in tumor progression and elimination ( Stark & Darnell , 2012 ; Castro et al . , 2018 ) . IFN - γ R is a hetero - tetramer composed of two copies of IFN - γ R1 and two cop - ies of IFN - γ R2 chains . Upon ligand binding , STATs are phosphorylated by receptor - docked JAKs and then dissoci - ate from the receptor to rapidly translocate to the nucleus as transcription factors that bind IFN - γ - activated site ( GAS ) elements and induce IFN - stimulated genes ( ISGs ) activa - tion ( Stark & Darnell , 2012 ; Philips et al . , 2022 ) . To investi - gate the role of actin in IFN - γ R signaling function , we first treated human immortalized fibroblasts with several specific actin - perturbing drugs prior to IFN - γ stimulation . Only the formin specific inhibitor , SMIFH2 decreased the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 ( pSTAT1 ) upon IFN - γ stimulation ( Fig . 1a ) . We did not observe any difference for pSTAT1 levels in cells treated with other actin related inhibitors , such as the actin monomer sequestering drug Latrunculin A ( LatA ) , the actin polymerization inhibitor Cytochalasin D ( CytoD ) , Arp2 / 3 inhibitor CK666 , and myosin - II inhibitor Blebbistatin ( Fig . 1a ) . Moreover , we recently showed that SMIFH2 and its derived compounds can directly inhibit IFN - γ activity in the extracellular medium ( Thoidingjam et al . , 2022 ) . To eliminate extracellular SMIFH2 before cytokine addition , we added a PBS washing step ( SMI - WASH ) prior to IFN - γ stimulation ( Fig . 1b ) . We first verified that SMI - WASH condition still significantly reduces F - actin polymeri - zation as visualized by phalloidin staining ( Extended data Fig . 1a ) , consistent with its original inhibitory effect on for - min - mediated actin elongation ( Rizvi et al . , 2009 ) . We ob - served that SMI - WASH still significantly decreased STAT1 phosphorylation level ( Fig . 1c ) and nuclear translocation ( Fig . 1d ) without affecting IFN - γ binding and uptake ( Ex - tended data Fig . 1b ) . To further characterize the impact of formin inhibition on JAK / STAT signaling , we monitored the activation of JAK1 and JAK2 that are respectively associat - ed with IFN - γ R1 and IFN - γ R2 , and upstream of STAT1 phosphorylation . We found that SMI - WASH treatment de - creased both JAK1 ( Fig . 1e ) and JAK2 ( Fig . 1f ) phosphoryla - tion levels upon IFN - γ stimulation . All together , we conclud - ed that formin inhibitor SMIFH2 specifically inhibits early stage of IFN - γ mediated JAK / STAT activation at the plasma membrane . Full length DIAPH3 / Dia2 is critical for IFN - γ - induced JAK / STAT signaling . We next sought to identify which specific formin proteins could be involved in IFN - γ induced JAK / STAT signaling . Us - ing siRNA - based screening , we could down - express at a significantly low protein level six individual formin members that all have been reported to be associated with the actin cortex ( Breitsprecher and Goode , 2013 ) : FMNL1 , FMNL2 , DIAPH1 ( Dia1 ) , DIAPH3 ( Dia2 ) , DAAM1 , and FHOD1 ( Ex - tended data Fig . 2a ) . Among those , only Dia2 down - expression was able to significantly inhibit STAT1 phosphor - ylation ( Fig . 2a , Extended data Fig . 2b ) , and nuclear translo - cation ( Fig . 2b , Extended data Fig . 2c ) , whereas Dia1 , a formin of the same Dia / DIAPH subfamily , had no effect ( Fig . 2a , 2b ) . Furthermore , down - expression of Dia2 decreased to the same extent the activation i . e . , the tyrosine phosphoryla - tion levels of JAK1 ( Fig . 2c ) and JAK2 kinases ( Fig . 2d ) downstream of IFN - γ stimulation , without modifying the ex - pression of receptor subunits IFN - γ R1 and IFN - γ R2 at the cell surface ( Extended data Fig . 2d , e ) . Since the JAK / STAT signaling pathway can be triggered by many cytokines and secreted factors , we tested whether Dia2 down - modulation would inhibit JAK / STAT activation in a global manner . Therefore , we compared pSTAT1 level in siDia2 treated fi - broblasts upon stimulation by either IFN - γ , IFN - α , or Epi - dermal Growth Factor ( EGF ) . Remarkably , we observed pSTAT1 decrease only in the case of IFN - γ stimulation . Stimulation by either IFN - α or EGF ( Fig . 2e ) , for which JAK / STAT activation requires endosomal sorting of the acti - vated receptors ( Vieira et al . , 1996 ; Marchetti et al . , 2006 ; Zanin et al . , 2023 ) was unaffected by Dia2 down - expression . Altogether , these results demonstrate that Dia2 regulates specifically JAK / STAT signaling at the plasma membrane level in response to IFN - γ . In human cells , Dia2 exists in seven isoforms , each with dis - tinct expression patterns . Notably , isoform 1 , which lacks both N - and C - terminal parts , is significantly less expressed compared to isoform 7 and the full - length isoform 3 ( Stastna et al . , 2012 ) . The N - and C - terminal parts of Dia2 , which are exclusive to isoform 3 , are essential for its proper localiza - tion and activation at the plasma membrane ( Fig . 2f ) ( Gorelik et al . , 2011 ; Rousso et al . , 2013 ; Ramalingam et al . , 2015 ; Bucki et al . , 2019 ) . The positively charged poly - basic region of Dia2 N - terminal part , referred to as N - PBR , has been shown to bind acidic phospholipids in vitro ( Gorelik et al . , 2011 ) . Meanwhile , the theoretical isoelectric point ( pI ) values obtained for both the N - PBR and C - PBR of Dia2 are above 8 ( pI > 8 ) , which suggests a potential association with | bioR χ iv | 3 Li et al . the plasma membrane through electrostatic interactions ( Fig . 2f ) . To understand the role of Dia2 N - and C - domains in the regulation of JAK / STAT signaling , we compared the overexpression of Dia2 full length isoform 3 and isoform1 devoid of N - and C - PBRs . Whereas Dia2 - isoform 3 overex - pression does not perturb STAT1 activation by IFN - γ stimu - lation , we observed a drastic inhibition of pSTAT1 nuclear translocation in cells overexpressing the Dia2 - isoform 1 ( Fig . 2g , Extended data Fig . 2f ) . Most likely , this inactivation results from the dominant - negative action of t he short cyto - solic isoform 1 , which depletes the substrate from the en - dogenous full - length isoform 3 . As a result , the full - length isoform 3 is unable to process actin filaments at the plasma membrane . Dia2 regulation of IFN - γR - dependent JAK / STAT signal - ing requires RhoA . Rho - GTPases are prominent regulatory factors of actin and myosin dynamics . Various triggers for RhoA activation in - clude the binding of extracellular ligands such as chemo - kines to G - protein linked receptors ( GPCR ) , cytokines and growth factors to their specific receptors , extracellular matrix ( ECM ) factors , and intercellular adhesion molecules ( ICAM ) to integrins ( Bros et al . , 2019 ) . The formin Dia / DIAPH sub - family ( Dia1 , Dia2 and Dia3 ) and Rho - associated protein kinase ( ROCK ) are the two major downstream effectors of RhoA ( Kühn & Geyer , 2014 ; Lu et al . , 2015 ) . The binding of active Rho - GTPases to the N - terminal GTPase binding do - main of formins leads to their activation by removing self - inhibition due to internal domains interaction ( Breitsprecher and Goode , 2013 ) . But how actin elongation induced by ac - tive RhoA is involved in the regulation of plasma membrane receptors is still poorly understood . To determine if Rho - GTPases could regulate IFN - γ - induced JAK / STAT signaling Fig . 1 . Formin inhibitor SMIFH2 impairs IFN - γR - induced JAK / STAT signaling .

Rhosin treatment led to a strong decrease in pSTAT1 levels and subsequent nuclear translocation ( Fig . 3a - c ) . Conversely , upon RhoCN03 treatment , a RhoA / B / C activator ( Freeman et al . , 2018 ) ( Fig . 3a - c ) , JAK / STAT activation by IFN - γ was fully restored ( Fig . 3a - c ) confirming the role of Rho - GTPases in IFN - γ R function .

Rhosin treatment in cells down - expressing either Dia1 or Dia2 ( Fig . 3d ) . Rhosin treatment alone or combined with Dia1 or Dia2 depletion reduced pSTAT1 levels ( Fig . 3e ) and nuclear translocation ( Fig . 3f ) to the same extent with no additional inhibition . Since RhoA has many different ef - fectors , it could potentially regulate JAK / STAT signaling through other partners than Dia2 . We therefore analyzed STAT1 activation level upon RhoCN03 treatment in Dia2 Fig . 3 . RhoA regulates JAK / STAT signaling through Dia2 activation .

Altogether , our data demonstrate that RhoA acts upstream of Dia2 and is nec - essary for the proper activation of JAK / STAT signaling by IFN - γ . Dia2 controls the diffusion dynamics of signaling re - ceptors at the plasma membrane . To investigate the contribution of Dia2 in the regulation of IFN - γ R dynamics and signaling , we monitored IFN - γ R membrane lateral diffusion in living cells using spot varia - tion fluorescence correlation spectroscopy ( svFCS ) ( Blouin et al . , 2016 ) . svFCS is a unique and powerful FCS - based methodology that enables to monitor protein and lipid lat - eral diffusion regimes at high resolution and with single molecule sensitivity in the plasma membrane of living cells ( Lasserre et al . , 2008 ) . We carried out svFCS analysis in COS - 7 cells stably expressing IFN - γ R2 - eGFP . At steady state , IFN - γ R2 - eGFP shows a typical diffusion pattern of dynamic assignment to nanodomains , with relatively high effective diffusion ( D eff ) coefficient and intercept with the time axis ( D eff = 0 . 55 ± 0 . 08 µm 2 . s - 1 ; t 0 = 22 . 93 ± 4 . 45 ms ) ( Fig . 4a ) , as previously described ( Blouin et al . , 2016 ) . We ad - dressed the potential involvement of formins in the lateral diffusion of IFN - γ R2 by first treating cells with SMIFH2 . This inhibitor drastically switched IFN - γ R2 diffusion from nanodomains to a free - like diffusion behavior with significa - tively lower D eff and t0 values ( D eff = 0 . 28 ± 0 . 02 µm 2 . s - 1 ; t 0 = 10 . 0 ± 5 . 14 ms ) ( Fig . 4a ) . Similarly to SMIFH2 , Dia2 deple - tion effectively changed diffusion coefficients with a severe impact on the dynamic diffusion of IFN - γ R2 at the plasma membrane ( D eff = 0 . 30 ± 0 . 02 µm 2 . s - 1 ; t 0 = 8 . 05 ± 4 . 18 ms ) ( Fig . 4a , b ) . However , Dia1 depletion had only a modest ef - fect on IFN - γ R2 lateral diffusion as we could only observe a minor change of t 0 and the effective diffusion values ( Fig . 4a ) . This agrees with the lack of effect Dia1 depletion on JAK / STAT signaling activation ( Fig . 2a - d ) . Remarkably , Dia2 depletion led to almost the same t 0 value observed with SMIFH2 treatment , confirming that Dia2 is the main formin candidate involved in IFN - γ R2 membrane partitioning and function . Moreover , Rhosin treatment modified the dynamic Fig . 4 . Dia2 controls the diffusion dynamics of membrane receptors at the plasma membrane .

Scale bar = 20 µm . diffusion of IFN - γ R2 ( D eff = 0 . 31 ± 0 . 03 µm 2 . s - 1 ) , similar to Dia2 depletion ( D eff = 0 . 38 ± 0 . 07 µm 2 . s - 1 ) ( Fig . 4b ) , which strengthens our conclusions regarding the role of RhoA up - stream of Dia2 . | bioR χ iv | 8 Li et al . | bioR χ iv | 9 Li et al . We also examined the regulation by Dia2 of the lateral dif - fusion of another plasma membrane receptor associated with lipid nanodomains , the GPI - AP Thy - 1 ( Lasserre et al . , 2008 ) . As observed for IFN - γ R2 , Dia2 depletion significant - ly decreases GFP - Thy - 1 constrained diffusion ( D eff = 1 . 24 ± 0 . 15 µm 2 . s - 1 ; t 0 = 14 . 78 ± 1 . 55 ms ) , transitioning it toward a free - like diffusion pattern ( D eff = 0 . 97 ± 0 . 11 µm 2 . s - 1 ; t 0 = 7 . 82 ± 1 . 89 ms ) . This change is again similar to the effects of Rhosin treatment ( D eff = 0 . 82 ± 0 , 09 µm 2 . s - 1 ; t 0 = 9 . 38 ± 2 , 63 ms ) ( Fig . 4c ) . All together , these data suggest that Dia2 regulates the dynamic diffusion of cell surface proteins and receptors . Dia2 is required for the formation of cholester - ol / sphingomyelin nanodomains at the plasma mem - brane . Sphingomyelin ( SM ) is a major sphingolipid present at the plasma membrane of mammalian cells . It is known to form specific membrane lipid nanodomains in conjunction with cholesterol ( Chol ) and glycosphingolipids ( GSLs ) . Our pre - vious work established the importance of these SM and Chol - dependent nanodomains in the physiological function of IFN - γ R ( Blouin et al . , 2016 ) . Accordingly , a potent SM binding motif was reported in the transmembrane domain of the IFN - γ R1 subunit ( Contreras et al . , 2012 ) . More recently , we have characterized a new Chol binding motif in the IFN - γ R2 transmembrane domain , and we found it to be manda - tory for IFN - γ R activation and signaling ( Morana et al . , 2022 ) . While the direct relationship between formins and SM - dependent lipid nanodomains has not been estab - lished , it has been proposed that short dynamic actin fila - ment structures known as “actin asters” , that are driven by RhoA - dependent acto - myosin contractility , regulate lipid nanodomain formation and receptor activation at the plas - ma membrane ( Kalappurakkal et al . , 2019 ; Wang , et al . , 2022 ) . To investigate the potential global impact of Dia2 on the nanoscale organization of lipids at the plasma mem - brane , we first monitor the behavior of the solvatochromic probe NR12A , which measures lipid ordering ( Danylchuk et al . , 2019 ; Carravilla et al . , 2021 ) . Using confocal microsco - py in live cells , we observed a decrease in the Gp value for the plasma membrane of Dia2 depleted cells compared to control , indicating a more liquid - disordered environment in the absence of Dia2 ( Fig . 4d ) . Therefore , we tested whether Dia2 could participate in the control of lipid nanodomains reorganization at the plasma membrane . Over the years , toxin - derived proteins have been widely used to monitor specific lipids at the plasma membrane under various con - ditions ( Kusumi et al . , 2023 ) . Recently , it has become pos - sible to distinguish among the three distinct pools of choles - terol at the plasma membrane : the non - accessible so - called “essential” pool , the accessible pool , and SM - sequestered cholesterol ( SM / Chol ) pool ( Radhakrishnan et al . , 2020 ; Kusumi et al . , 2023 ) . We purified and fluorescently labelled Ostreolysin A ( OlyA ) , a toxin known for its specific recogni - tion of SM conformation when associated with cholesterol within SM / Chol complexes ( Fig . 5a ) ( Endapally et al . , 2019 ) . In parallel , we also used the Domain 4 ( D4 probe ) of Perfringolysin O , which only detects the accessible pool of cholesterol ( Shimada et al . , 2002 ) ( Fig . 5a ) . In agreement with the literature , OlyA exhibited a concentration - dependent binding on cells , which was abolished upon SM removal by sphingomyelinase ( SMase ) treatment , confirming its specific affinity for SM ( Extended data Fig . 3a , b ) . It is noteworthy that both SMIFH2 treatment and Dia2 depletion significantly reduced OlyA binding ( Fig . 5b , d ) , indicating a decrease of SM / Chol complexes at the outer leaflet of the plasma mem - brane . In parallel , both global formin inhibition and Dia2 de - pletion dramatically increase the surface binding of D4 probe , revealing a higher amount of free cholesterol on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane ( Fig . 5c , e ) . The variations in lipid probes binding observed under Dia2 depletion could not be solely attributed to changes in lipid quantities since lipidomic analysis performed on both control and Dia2 - depleted cells , revealed no differences in the total cellular levels of cholesterol and sphingomyelin ( Fig . 5f ) . Moreover , the overexpression of human Dia2 isoform 1 also decreased the SM / Chol complex staining with OlyA ( Fig . 5g ) , in line with its dominant negative effect on IFN - γ - induced JAK / STAT signaling ( Fig . 2f , g ) . In summary , these experiments demonstrate that Dia2 is necessary for main - taining SM / Chol complexes and plays a pivotal role in regu - lating the equilibrium among the different pool of cholesterol at the plasma membrane . Dia2 regulates the nano - organization of SM / Chol com - plexes at the plasma membrane . We used total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy ( TIRFM ) coupled to dual - color direct stochastic optical re - construction microscopy ( dual - color dSTORM ) coupled to spectral - demixing mode ( Lampe et al . , 2015 ; Lehmann et al . , 2015 ) to simultaneously investigate the nanoscale locali - zation of endogenous IFN - γ R1 and OlyA ( SM / Chol com - plexes ) ( Extended data Fig . 4 ) . Dia2 - depleted cells exhibited a significant reduction in OlyA labelling density at the plasma membrane compared to control ( Fig . 6a and Extended data Fig . 5a ) consistent with our observations using spinning - disk microscopy ( Fig . 5d ) . We applied density - based spatial clus - tering of applications with noise ( DBSCAN ) cluster analysis ( Rahbek - Clemmensen et al . , 2017 ; Nieves et al . , 2023 ) on the STORM coordinates ( Fig . 6a ) . This analysis revealed that in the absence of Dia2 , there was a decrease in the fraction of detected OlyA molecules assembled into clusters ( Fig . 6b ) , a reduction in the mean cluster size ( Fig . 6c ) , and a change in the cluster size distribution ( Fig . 6e ) , with indi - vidual clusters being more distant from each other ( Fig . 6d ) .

In contrast , we observed that the propensity of IFN - γ R1 to form clusters of the same size was preserved in cells lack - ing Dia2 compared to control ( Fig . 6f - h , j and Extended data Fig . 5b ) . These data suggest that a decreased amount of SM / Chol complex at the plasma membrane does not alter the formation or maintenance of IFN - γ R1 clusters . It is noteworthy that Dia2 depletion resulted in a slight but signif - icant increase in the mean distance between IFN - γ R1 clus - ters ( Fig . 6i ) . We further investigated the potential co - localization between IFN - γ R1 and OlyA bound to SM / Chol complex , using their respective coordinates . When consid - ering both the full signal and DBSCAN clustered images at a 20 nm resolution , we observed that IFN - γ R1 clusters ex - hibited reduced proximity with the fewer OlyA clusters in cells lacking Dia2 ( Fig . 6k , I , Extended data Fig . 5c ) . Thus , our data conclusively demonstrate that Dia2 is essential for the nanoscale organization of SM / Chol lipid complexes at the plasma membrane and their association with IFN - γ R into lipid nanodomains . Dia2 regulates PD - L1 stability at the plasma membrane . We next investigated whether the role of Dia2 in organizing lipids at the plasma membrane could affect other cellular functions beyond JAK / STAT signaling . The programmed cell - death ligand 1 ( PD - L1 ) induces PD - 1 - mediated T cell exhaustion , inhibiting the antitumor cytotoxic T cell response and leading to tumor survival and growth ( Ribas & Wolchok , 2018 ) . Recently , it has been shown that the lipidic environ - ment of the plasma membrane , especially cholesterol , and acidic phospholipids such as phosphatidylserine ( PS ) , is es - sential for PD - L1 stability and function ( Wen et al . , 2021 ; Wang et al . , 2022 ) . To assess whether Dia2 influences PD - L1 expression at the plasma membrane , we monitored PD - L1 expression in HeLaM cells by immunofluorescence and western blotting upon EGF and TNF - α stimulations . Both EGF and TNF - α induce PD - L1 expression via the PI3K / AKT and the MEK / ERK pathways , respectively ( Jiang et al . , 2019 ) . As expected , we observed an induction of PD - L1 ex - pression , with both plasma membrane and total levels in - creased after 24 h of EGF and TNF - α stimulation ( Fig . 7a - c ) . Under the same conditions , we found that Dia2 depletion decreased both plasma membrane and total PD - L1 levels ( Fig . 7a - c ) . Since we showed that Dia2 depletion does not inhibit EGF signaling ( Fig . 2e ) , these findings strongly sug - gest that Dia2 regulates PD - L1 stability and degradation through the formation of lipid nanodomain at the plasma Fig . 7 . Dia2 is essential for the stability of PD - L1 at the plasma membrane .

( d ) Schematic showing how Dia2 controls receptor signaling by organizing plasma membrane lipid ( nano ) landscape . At steady state , RhoA - Dia2 pathway controls both SM / Chol complex and nanodomain formation at the plasma membrane , which determines plasma membrane nanopartitioning , activation and stability of receptors and lipids . The Dia2 - isoform1 that lacks poly - basic amino acid regions loss the SM / Chol complex formation ability , resulting in dysfunction of JAK / STAT signaling . Data shown are mean ± SEM .

This regulation most likely reflects Dia2 impact on SM / Chol distribution on the cell surface , as well as the cellular levels of PS and PE , as indicated by lipidomic anal - ysis ( Fig . 4f ) . Discussion The molecular machinery driving or maintaining the assem - bly of lipid nanodomains around transmembrane receptors is largely unknown . The cortical actin cytoskeleton has been reported to influence membrane organization and molecular diffusion at the plasma membrane ( Jaqaman et al . , 2011 ; Fritzsche et al . , 2016 ; Fujiwara et al . , 2016 ; Köster & Mayor , 2016 ) . Based on theoretical and experimental data , it was proposed that actin asters , made of cortical short dynamic actin filaments driven by myosin , regulate the nano - partitioning of membrane proteins ( Gowrishankar , et al . , 2012 ) . Dynamic actin remodeling has been involved in GPI - AP nanoclustering ( Kalappurakkal et al . , 2019 ) and in the formation of CD44 - containing actin barriers that build pickets ( Freeman et al . , 2018 ; Sil et al . , 2020 ) . Actin elongation driven by formins may be involved in these processes , as SMIFH2 treatment affected GPI - APs and CD44 nanocluster - ing ( Kalappurakkal et al . , 2019 ; Sil et al . , 2020 ) . How cortical actin and formins regulate the spatio - temporal dynamics of transmembrane protein association with specific lipid nanodomains at the plasma membrane is still elusive ( Mayor et al . , 2023 ) . Herein , we investigated the role of formin / Dia2 in lipid nanodomain formation . First , we observed a decrease in global lipid ordering at the plasma membrane in the absence of Dia2 , which suggests a partial loss of membrane lipid packing heterogeneity . We then studied the distribution of SM / Chol complexes at the plasma membrane using specific SM / Chol and free cholesterol probes . Dia2 depletion result - ed in a significant decrease in the amount of SM / Chol com - plexes together with a concomitant increase of free choles - terol on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane . In the ab - sence of Dia2 , lipidomics indicate that free cholesterol is re - leased from the SM / Chol complexes since no change was found in the total cellular amount of cholesterol and SM . We studied the distribution of SM / Chol complexes and IFN - γ R at the single molecular level with TIRF - dSTORM . We observed fewer and more dispersed lipid clusters at the plasma mem - brane of Dia2 depleted cells , indicating that the loss of Dia2 prevents the formation of SM / Chol nanodomains . Of note , images from super - resolved microscopy revealed that Dia2 depletion reduced the proximity of IFN - γ R1 clusters from SM / Chol complexes . This is consistent with the observations made with svFCS on the loss of dynamic partitioning of IFN - γ R in nanodomains . In this context , the presence of a cho - lesterol binding motif ( Sen et al . , 2011 ) and a SM binding motif ( Contreras et al . , 2012 ) located at the transmembrane domain ( TMD ) of IFN - γ R1 subunit is informative . More re - cently , a new consensus Chol - binding motif within the IFN - γ R2 TMD , which is required for JAK / STAT signal transduc - tion , has been identified ( Morana et al . , 2022 ) . The potential interactions mediated by the newly identified lipid binding sites of IFN - γ R are certainly critical for inducing conforma - tional changes in IFN - γ R upon ligand binding ( Blouin et al . , 2016 ) . Thus , we propose that Dia2 plays a direct role in con - trolling the association of IFN - γ Rs with specific lipids . An intriguing question is how Dia2 , which is active at the in - ner leaflet of the plasma membrane , can regulate lipid nanodomain formation on the outer leaflet . Outer - leaflet do - mains enriched in SM and cholesterol , along with specific li - pids such as phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) enriched in the inner leaflet , have been reported to mutually regulate each other and to be coupled in a trans - bilayer manner ( Abe et al . , 2012 , Abe et al . , 2021 ) . Such trans - bilayer mechanism could theoretically apply to Dia2 since it can interact with and stabilize PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 domains through the binding of its N - terminal basic domain , a process favored by cholesterol ( Bucki et al . , 2019 ) . Thus , Dia2 could regulate lipid nanodomain formation not only through actin elongation but also through direct interaction with the plasma membrane . Another mechanism of trans - bilayer coupling was proposed , wherein GPI - APs localized in the outer leaflet in - teract with the long acyl - chain interdigitations of negatively charged lipid phosphatidyl serine ( PS ) localized in the inner leaflet . Then , additional membrane associated adapters would couple PS to the dynamic actin - myosin machinery through electrostatic interactions and facilitate the nanoclus - tering of GPI - APs ( Raghupathy et al . , 2015 ) . In this context , we observed that Dia2 depletion decreased PS by 37 . 3 % , while increasing by 29 . 1 % the less negatively charged phos - phatidylethanolamine ( PE ) ( Fig . 5f ) . It is therefore possible that the loss of Dia2 , which results in the reduction of the overall negative charge at the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane , may perturb the proper recruitment of adapters . The perturbed diffusion of Thy - 1 revealed svFCS in the ab - sence of Dia2 ( Fig . 4c ) may thus reflect the modified cluster - ing of GPI - APs . We found that RhoA is an essential regulator , upstream of Dia2 , for the activation of JAK / STAT signaling by IFN - γ . The spatiotemporal distribution and activation of Rho - GTPases play a significant role in the recruitment and arrangement of actin assembly factors at the plasma membrane . Formins are intrinsically autoinhibited in the cytoplasm and are recruited to the plasma membrane upon interaction with active Rho - GTPases ( Pollard , 2016 ; Chen et al . , 2020 ) . Upon RhoA acti - vation , plasma membrane associated - Dia2 can initiate the nucleation and elongation of cortical actin filaments , which in turn could reinforce Dia2 anchorage to the plasma mem - brane . Remarkably , the overexpression of GFP - Dia2 - isoform 1 , which lacks N - terminal poly - basic amino acid residues and acts as a dominant negative competitor , led to both the downregulation of SM / Chol complexes at the plasma mem - brane and the inhibition of JAK / STAT signaling . RhoA itself could directly mediate the formation lipid nanodomains and their assembly around the IFN - γ R by interacting with specific lipids and its effectors . This mechanism was revealed for ac - tivated Rac1 that partitions into nanoclusters enriched in PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ( Remorino et al . , 2017 ) . It is there - fore , likely that the active sorting and non - homogenous lat - eral distribution of RhoA and formins at the plasma mem - brane play an important role in the formation and mainte - nance of specific and functional lipid nanodomains . Finally , when Dia2 is depleted , we observed reduced expres - sion of PD - L1 at the cell surface and intracellularly . A role for formins in PD - L1 expression had never been reported . How - ever , it is known that actin controls the expression of PD - L1 at the plasma membrane , as the actin polymerization inhibitor CytoD significantly reduces PD - L1 protein levels ( Miyazawa et al . , 2018 ) . Moreover , gene silencing of the ERM scaffold - | bioR χ iv | 12 Li et al . ing proteins , namely ezrin , radixin and moesin , that crosslink actin filaments at the plasma membrane , reduces PD - L1 cell surface expression without affecting mRNA levels ( Kobori et al . , 2021 ; Tanaka et al . , 2021 ) . PD - L1 is a type I transmem - brane protein ( Zak et al . , 2017 ) presenting a small cyto - plasmic domain ( CD ) encompassing residues 260 – 290 , that is involved in PD - L1 protein stability and degradation . Dele - tion of the CD tail renders PD - L1 resistant to proteosomal degradation through ubiquitination ( Zhang et al . , 2018 ) . In addition , palmitoylation of CD Cys272 regulates PD - L1 sta - bility and trafficking ( Yang et al . , 2019 ; Yao et al . , 2019 ) . PD - L1 degradation is prevented when the CD tail properly binds to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane through electrostatic interactions ( Wen et al . , 2021 ) . Two cholester - ol - recognition amino acid consensus ( CRAC ) motifs present in the transmembrane domain of PD - L1 have recently been identified as critical for the protein stability at the plasma membrane ( Wang et al . , 2022 ) . Based on these studies and the current study , it is highly likely that the strong downregu - lation of PD - L1 results from increased degradation induced by the absence of a suitable lipidic environment . The JAK / STAT pathway stands as a paradigm of receptor - mediated signal transduction , with implications in numerous human pathologies . Recently , it has attracted a new surge of interest due to many studies that have revealed the pivot - al role of IFN - γ in the intricate process of tumor progression and evasion from immune checkpoints ( Benci et al . , 2019 ) . Our study has uncovered a significant and novel contribution from the formin Dia2 , which plays a crucial role in precisely tuning the JAK / STAT signaling cascade orchestrated by IFN - γR . More broadly , this work brings new mechanistic in - sights on how actin and lipid nanodomains collaborate to spatiotemporally regulate the nano - organization of mem - brane receptors and their corresponding bioactivities .

For STAT1 , the phosphorylated and total protein levels were assayed on the same blot with the primary antibodies mouse anti - pSTAT1 and rabbit anti - STAT1 , and visualized using fluorescence and lumines - cence , respectively . The ratio of phosphorylated - to - total pro - tein was determined for each time point . STAT1 phosphorylation and its nucleus translocation Cells were cultured in DMEM Glutamax ( Gibco ) with 10 % bo - vine fetal serum , and then stimulated by switching the medi - um with DMEM , supplemented with 1000 U / ml of human re - combinant IFN - γ ( BioLegend ) , 20 ng / ml of EGF ( Sigma ) or 1000 U / ml of IFN - α ( gift from Biosidus ) for 10 min at 37 °C . Prior to IFN - γ stimulation , cells were treated with 25 µM SMIFH2 for 20 min . For the SMI - WASH treatment , cells were treated with 25 µM SMIFH2 for 20 min , following with PBS wash to remove the extracellular SMIFH2 before IFN - γ stimu - lation . For the Rhosin treatment , cells were cultured in DMEM Glutamax ( Gibco ) with 10 % bovine fetal serum for 24 h , which was then replaced by DMEM Glutamax 0 . 2 % bovine fetal serum , supplemented with 30 µM of Rhosin ( Sigma ) for 24 h . For the RhoCN03 rescue experiment , Rhosin ( 30 µM ) and RhoCN03 ( 0 . 25 µg / ml ) ( Cytoskeleton , Inc . ) were added on cells for 4 h prior to IFN - γ stimulation . For biochemical analysis , cells were washed with ice cold PBS and lysed in SDS Sample Buffer as described earlier . Total lysates were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and Western blot analysis . For the immunoblot signal analysis , pSTAT1 levels were quantified by calculating the ratio between pSTAT1 and STAT1 . For immunofluorescent analysis , cells were grown on coverslips , treated as described above and then fixed with cold methanol at - 20°C for 10 min . After washing with cold PBS , cells were incubated with primary anti - pSTAT1 antibody for 1 h at room temperature and revealed by using a AlexaFluor488 - conjugated goat anti - mouse secondary antibody . pSTAT1 nucleus translocation was quantified with Fiji software ( Schindelin et al . , 2012 ) by calculating the nuclei - cytosolic ratio of pSTAT1 signal ( Nuclei masks were realized with the DAPI staining ) . Actin staining To stain for global actin network , cells were grown on co - verslips in DMEM Glutamax ( Gibco ) with 10 % bovine fetal serum for 24 h . Cells were then treated with 25 µM SMIFH2 or SMI - WASH at 37 °C for 20 min , and fixed with 4 % PFA on ice for 5 min and at room temperature for 20 min . After three PBS washes , cells were permeabilized with saponin ( 0 . 2 mg / ml ) at room temperature for 10min , then were co - incubated with AF647 labeled phalloidin ( Cytoskeleton , Inc . ) at room temperature for 30 min . Immunofluorescence images were collected by epifluorescence microscopy and quantified with Fiji software ( Schindelin et al . , 2012 ) by calculating the mean intensity of fluorophore - labeled phalloidin . To stain cell cortical actin network . Cells were transfected with siRNAs for 48 h , then transferred to coverslips for 24 h , and fixed with 4 % PFA on ice for 5 min and at room tempera - ture for 20 min . After washing with PBS , then directly co - incubated with AF647 - labeled phalloidin at room temperature for 30 min . Super - resolution images were collected by STORM imaging and analyzed by NEO software ( Abbelight ) . Cell surface staining of IFN - γR Cells were grown on coverslips in DMEM Glutamax ( Gibco ) with 10 % bovine fetal serum , and then washed with ice - cold PBS . Cells were washed with cold PBS , following with prima - ry anti - IFN - γR1 ( 1 : 100 ) ( BD Biosciences ) and anti - IFN - γR2 ( 1 : 50 ) ( Proteintech ) antibody on ice for 60 min . After primary antibody binding , cells were washed with cold PBS , then fol - lowing with 4 % PFA on ice for 5 min and at room temperature for 20 min . Cells then were wash with cold PBS again , follow - | bioR χ iv | 14 Li et al . ing co - incubated with fluorophore - labeled secondary anti - bodies at room temperature for 45 min . Images were ac - quired using a spinning disk microscope ( Inverted Eclipse Ti - E , Nikon ; 60x CFI Plan Apo VC oil immersion objective ; Spinning disk CSU - X1 , Yokogawa ; Camera sCMOS Prime 95B , Photometrics ) . Surface expression levels were quanti - fied using Fiji software ( Schindelin et al . , 2012 ) by calculat - ing the mean intensity of fluorescence signal in the sum pro - jected images . svFCS The setup is built around an inverted Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope , equipped with a C - Apochromat 40× 1 . 2 NA ob - jective f . A 488 nm excitation laser wavelength illuminates the back aperture of the objective ( ≈ 2 µW ) . Once separated from excitation by a 488 nm dichroic mirror and out - of - focus rejection through confocal pinhole , the backward fluores - cence is collected by an avalanche photodiode . The back aperture of the objective is under - filled by the laser beam in order to size the FCS volume of observation ( Lenne et al . , 2006 ) . The defined radius of the excitation beam ( namely the waist size , w , ranging from 200 - 400 nm ) is preliminary calibrated according to the Rhodamine 6G diffusion coeffi - cient ( 280 µm² / s in aqueous solution at 37°C ) , the estimation of the measurement error being linear with the w² value without exceeding 0 . 5 % even for the larger waist ( Billaudeau et al . , 2013 ) . For the measurements on living cells , the laser beam focused by the objective is precisely placed at the plasma membrane following a z - scan procedure allowing locating the observation volume at the maximum of fluores - cence intensity in the z - axis . The fluorescence signals emit - ted from the molecules inside the spot volume are then col - lected . For each observation spot size , each series ( be - tween 10 to 15 series of 20 recordings of 5 second each ) was performed on different low fluorescent cells ( densi - ty ~ 200 molecules / µm² as evaluated from the autocorrelation function ( ACF ) ) . For each series , the 20 recordings are se - lected on the basis of the fundamental FCS assumption in order to keep only the measurements that are in a stationary regime , meaning that the signal fluctuations show a time - invariant profile . Any “abnormal” recordings are discarded ; they could be due to strong membrane or cellular move - ments , or vesicular trafficking . Indeed , the former generates a loose of the focalized spot of observation at the plasma membrane , the later , a collective contribution of individual fluorescently labeled molecules present within endocytic vesicles whose sizes are always smaller than the observa - tion spot . The abrupt and strongly altered signal fluctuation is immediately identifiable on the auto - correlated function due to the invalidation of the time invariance requested for the analysis . The mean of the kept ACFs is fitted with a two - component model . Equation 1 where N is the number of molecules , A the ratio of slow dif - fusing molecules with a diffusion time t d ( the one used for the diffusion plots ) compared to the fast - diffusing ones ( pre - sumably corresponding to eGFP proteins non - covalently bound to the receptor ) . For a given waist , the mean diffusion time calculated from 10 to 15 series is weighted in accord - ance with the number of kept ACF per series . The estimation of the t d and w 2 values were determined using a maximum likelihood estimation considering a Gaussian kernel of the individual and independent recordings with their experimental standard deviations . The diffusion plots were obtained by drawing the average t d ( for each series at a defined waist ) and their associated errors ( square root of the variance ) as a function of w 2 . The values of t 0 and D eff were estimated from the diffusion plots by computing the linear regression analysis simultaneously accounting for the estimation errors of t d and w 2 . The estimation variances for t 0 and D eff according to equation 2 were given by the Cramer - Rao bound . Equation 2 where t d is the diffusion time , w the spot radius , t 0 the y - axis intercept of the diffusion plots , D eff the effective diffusion coef - ficient proportional to the inverse of the slope of the diffusion plots . The interpretation of the data is done based on the numerical simulations where the variation of t 0 corresponds to different modes of membrane compartmentalization ( Wawrezinieck et al . , 2005 ; Lenne et al . , 2006 ) . In the case of free diffusion ( under the Brownian diffusion constraint ) , the FCS diffusion law projection intercepts the time axis at the origin ( t 0 = 0 ) ; in negative axis ( t 0 < 0 ) when molecules are confined by meshwork barriers , or in positive axis ( t 0 > 0 ) when molecules dynamically associate with traps and do - mains ( lipid nanodomains ) ( He & Marguet , 2011 ; Mailfert et al . , 2020 ) . Gp value measurement Lipid packing was monitored with the global polarization ( Gp ) of NR12A , a solvatochromic photostable plasma membrane - targeting dye ( gift from Andrey Klymchenko ) . Briefly , siRNA transfected HeLaM cells were incubated for 10 min with 200 nM NR12A at room temperature and then wash with DMEM medium without serum . Pictures were acquired with a Nikon A1RHD25 confocal microscope equipped with a CFI Plan Lambda S 100X NA 1 . 35 silicon immersion objective . Only the images obtained close to the glass substrate , corre - sponding to the plasma membrane were considered . Gp val - ues for each pixel were then calculated using the plugin for Fiji described in ( Carravilla et al . , 2021 ) . The following formu - la was used , where Ib and Ir are the intensities recorded at 580 – 630 nm ( liquid ordered ) and 650 – 700 nm ( liquid disor - dered ) channels , respectively : Sphingomyelin probes purification and labeling OlyA - His6 - WT overexpression was induced at 18°C with 1 mM IPTG for 16 h , and the recombinant protein was purified by nickel chromatography followed by gel filtration ( Plateform of protein production , Institut Curie ) using the same proce - dures as described in ( Endapally et al . , 2019 ) . After purifica - tion , OlyA - His6 was labeled with Alexa Fluor 647TM C2 - maleimide dye as described previously ( Endapally et al . , 2019 ) . Staining of cell surface lipids with OlyA and D4 For the surface staining , HeLaM cells were transfected with | bioR χ iv | 15 Li et al . siRNAs for 3 days , SMIFH2 treatment for 20 min , transfect - ed with constructs of Dia2 - isoforms for 48 h , or in presence of sphingomyelinase ( SMase , Sigma ) ( 0 . 3 unit / ml ) for 1 h . After PBS wash , cells were incubated with either OlyA ( 3 µM ) or D4 - mCherry ( 10 µg / ml , gift from Toshihide Koba - yashi ) probes in 1 % BSA - PBS ( v / v ) at room temperature for 5 min , then fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) for 20 min . Images were acquired using a spinning disk micro - scope ( Inverted Eclipse Ti - E , Nikon ; 60x CFI Plan Apo VC oil immersion objective ; Spinning disk CSU - X1 , Yokogawa ; Camera sCMOS Prime 95B , Photometrics ) . Surface expres - sion levels were quantified using Fiji software ( Schindelin et al . , 2012 ) by calculating the mean intensity of fluorescence signal in the sum projected images . Sample preparation for lipidomic analysis HeLaM cells were transfected with siRNA for 3 days , then washed 3 times with 150 mM ammonium bicarbonate ( NH 4 HCO 3 ) and co - incubated with NH4HCO3 for 5 minutes on ice . After 3 washes by centrifugation with 1 ml of NH 4 HCO 3 medium , the cell pellets ( 1 . 10 6 cells ) were collect - ed with 200 µl of NH 4 HCO 3 medium , then quickly frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored at - 80°C for later use . The lipids were extracted in chloroform / methanol , pre - mixed with in - ternal standard mix , then analyzed at the metabolomics and lipidomics platform of Institut Curie on Q Exactive Plus Hy - brid Quadrupole - Orbitrap Mass Spectrometer ( Thermo Sci - entific ) . Sample preparation for dSTORM Precision Cover Glasses , # 1 . 5H ( 170 µm thickness ) ( THOR labs ) were cleaned in solution A ( 125 ml MillQ H 2 O , 25 ml NH 4 OH and 25 ml H 2 O 2 ) at 80°C for more than 2 h , then fol - lowed by MeOH at room temperature for 10 min . The HeLaM cells ( siRNA treatment ) are seeded on above cleaned coverslips and cultured for 24 h . The cells were washed with PBS , then directly fixed with 4 % PFA on ice for 5 min , then at room temperature for 20 min . The cells fol - lowed by an incubation with the SM / Chol probe OlyA ( 3 µM ) and primary anti - IFN - γR1 antibody ( 1 : 50 ) ( BD Biosciences ) together in 1 % BSA - PBS at room temperature for 90 min , then washed by PBS and co - incubated with fluorophore CF680 - labeled secondary antibody at room temperature for 60 min . After immunolabeling , a post - fixation step was per - formed using 4 % PFA at room temperature for 15 min after PBS wash . The cells were then quenched for auto - fluorescence from PFA in 50 mM NH 4 Cl at room tempera - ture for 15 min , and then following with PBS wash . The co - verslips were kept with PBS until being imaged . Acquisition setup of single - molecule localization mi - croscopy dSTORM Coverslips are mounted on slides with cavity ( Sigma ) filled with Everspark buffer ( protocol here : https : / / www . idylle - labs . com / everspark - by - eternity # protocol ) , and then sealed with twinsil ( Picodent ) . Single molecule imaging was done using an Abbelight SAFe360 with the spectral demixing mode ( dichroic mirror at 700 nm , Chroma ) with two sCMOS cameras ( Hamamatsu Fusion BT ) mounted on an inverted Nikon Ti2 - E microscope with a 100X 1 . 49 NA objective . The laser used is an Oxxius 640 nm ( 500 mW , around 3 , 5 kW / cm² at the sample under experimental condition ) at the TIRF angle to specifically excite fluorophores at the plasma membrane near the coverslip ( The first few hundred nano - metres from coverslip ) . To summarize the spectral demixing mode , the partially overlapping emissions of the AF647 and CF680 are spectrally split with the 700 nm dichroic beamsplit - ter before reaching two separated cameras . Then , the inten - sity ratios between both cameras for each localization are calculated to allocate each particle to the good wavelength ( Winterflood et al . , 2015 ) . Each acquisition was made with 20 ms exposure time and around 30 , 000 frames . The data were analyzed with NEO software from Abbelight for noise filtering , cluster fraction , cluster size and localization . Density - based spatial clustering of applications with noise ( DBSCAN ) analysis of dSTORM We used DBSCAN for cluster analysis . This density - based clustering algorithm searches for clusters by looking for num - ber of localizations within a circle defined by its radius , ε , and its center , p . If the area of the circle contains more than a minimum number of points ( MinPts ) , a new cluster with p as a core object is created . Thus , the DBSCAN algorithm re - quires the definition of the two input parameters ε and MinPts . The algorithm then subsequently tests all the locali - zations found in the first cluster for having MinPts within a radius , ε , and assigns them to the cluster , and so forth . If a localization does not have MinPts within ε , this point is de - fined as a border point of the cluster . We evaluated the MinPts carefully by keeping the real signal and remove the background noise or the monomer fraction localization , and chose MinPts of 5 for OlyA , and MinPts of 10 for IFN - γR1 . Then , we evaluated the fraction in cluster , cluster size in a range of ε : 200 , 150 , 100 and 50 nm . For SM / Chol cluster , we analyzed the fraction in cluster , the cluster size distribu - tion , the mean of cluster size with ε = 150 and MinPts = 5 , as 10 times smaller size of probe OlyA ( 15 . 6 KDa ) than normal antibody . For IFN - γR1 cluster , we analyzed the fraction in cluster , the cluster size distribution with ε = 50 and MinPts = 10 , to achieve a search radius that would allow more than one IFN - γR1 protein with antibodies bound next to each other . We analyzed the mean of cluster size with ε = 30 and MinPts = 5 , as same result as ε = 50 and MinPts = 10 ( da - ta not shown here ) . We analyzed the distance between clus - ters of OlyA with ε = 150 and MinPts = 5 , and IFN - γR1 with ε = 50 and MinPts = 5 . We evaluated the directly localizations with or without DBSCAN between SM / Chol complex and IFN - γR1 at the 20 nm resolution . PD - L1 immunostaining Cells were grown on coverslips in DMEM Glutamax ( Gibco ) with 10 % bovine fetal serum , and then stimulated with EGF ( Sigma , 20 ng / ml ) or TNF - α ( CurieCoreTech recombinant protein - Institut Curie , 20 ng / ml ) for 24 h at 37 °C . Cells were washed with ice cold PBS and surface stain with primary anti - PD - L1 ( 1 : 50 ) antibody ( BioLegend ) on ice for 90 min . After primary antibody binding , cells were washed with ice cold PBS , and fixed with 4 % PFA on ice for 5 min and at room temperature for 20 min . After PBS wash , cells were incubat - ed with fluorophore - labeled secondary antibodies at room temperature for 45 min . The images were collected on spin - ning disk microscope , and surface expression level was quantified with ImageJ software ( NIH ) by calculating the mean intensity of signal . Statistics and reproducibility All analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 8 . 0 to 9 . 0 , ( GraphPad Software ) . Two - tailed ( paired or un - paired ) Student’s t - tests and Kolmogorov – Smirnov tests were used when comparing only two conditions . For more than two | bioR χ iv | 16 Li et al . conditions , the Kruskal – Wallis test was used with Dunn’s multiple comparison test and Tukey ' s multiple comparisons test was used . For comparison of Cluster parameters ob - tained from dSTORM pictures , we used linear mixed - effects model with Jamovi software ( https : / / www . jamovi . org ) . Signif - icantly different comparisons of means are marked on the graphs with asterisks . Error bars denote s . e . m . or s . d . No statistical method was used to pre - determine sample size . The investigators were not blinded to allocation during ex - periments and outcome assessment . For comparison be - tween experimental groups ( control vs treatment ) , the sam - ples were assigned randomly to each group . All the control and treated experiments were done on the same day side by side using the same reagents batches . Unless stated otherwise in the figure legends , all representative results shown for immunolabelling , and western blots were per - formed at least three times independently with similar re - sults . Statistical reports for all cells from the three experi - ments ; smaller solid circles represent individual cells , larger circles represent mean of each experiment , and the same level of transparency corresponds to the same experiment .
