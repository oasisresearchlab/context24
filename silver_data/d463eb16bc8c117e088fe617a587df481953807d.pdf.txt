Volume 26 September 15 , 2015 3275 MBoC | ARTICLE The EHD protein Past1 controls postsynaptic membrane elaboration and synaptic function ABSTRACT Membranes form elaborate structures that are highly tailored to their specialized cellular functions , yet the mechanisms by which these structures are shaped remain poorly understood . Here , we show that the conserved membrane - remodeling C - terminal Eps15 Ho - mology Domain ( EHD ) protein Past1 is required for the normal assembly of the subsynaptic muscle membrane reticulum ( SSR ) at the Drosophila melanogaster larval neuromuscular junc - tion ( NMJ ) . past1 mutants exhibit altered NMJ morphology , decreased synaptic transmission , reduced glutamate receptor levels , and a deficit in synaptic homeostasis . The membrane - re - modeling proteins Amphiphysin and Syndapin colocalize with Past1 in distinct SSR subdo - mains and collapse into Amphiphysin - dependent membrane nodules in the SSR of past1 mutants . Our results suggest a mechanism by which the coordinated actions of multiple lipid - binding proteins lead to the elaboration of increasing layers of the SSR and uncover new roles for an EHD protein at synapses . INTRODUCTION Dozens of lipid - binding proteins dynamically remodel membranes , generating diverse cell shapes , sculpting organelles , and promoting traffic between subcellular compartments . Although the activities of many of these membrane - remodeling proteins have been studied individually , what is lacking is an understanding of how membrane - remodeling factors work together to generate specialized mem - branes in vivo . C - terminal Eps15 Homology Domain ( EHD ) – family proteins en - code large membrane - binding ATPases with structural similarity to dynamin and function at a variety of steps of membrane transport ( Naslavsky and Caplan , 2011 ) . These proteins contain an ATPase do - main , a helical lipid - binding domain , and a carboxy - terminal EH do - main that interacts with Asn - Pro - Phe ( NPF ) – containing binding part - ners ( Naslavsky and Caplan , 2011 ) . Although their mechanism of action is not fully understood , it is postulated that C - terminal EHD proteins bind and oligomerize in an ATP - dependent manner on membrane compartments , where they are involved in the trafficking of cargo ( Grant et al . , 2001 ; Lin et al . , 2001 ; Lee et al . , 2005 ; Daumke et al . , 2007 ) . The mouse and human genomes each contain four highly similar EHD proteins ( EHD1 – 4 ) , which have both unique and overlapping functions ( Naslavsky and Caplan , 2011 ) . EHD proteins interact with several members of the Bin / Amphiphysin / Rvs167 ( BAR ) and Fes / Cip4 homology - BAR ( F - BAR ) protein families , which them - selves can remodel membranes via their crescent - shaped dimeric BAR domains ( Masuda and Mochizuki , 2010 ) . In mammals , EHD pro - teins associate with the NPF motifs of the F - BAR proteins Syndapin I and II , and these interactions are critical for recycling of cargo from endosomes to the plasma membrane in cultured cells ( Xu et al . , 2004 ; Braun et al . , 2005 ) . In Caenorhabditis elegans , the sole EHD protein Rme - 1 colocalizes and functions with the BAR protein Amphiphysin and the F - BAR protein Syndapin , also via their NPF motifs ( Pant et al . , 2009 ) . Further , EHD1 has been suggested to drive the scission of endosomal recycling tubules generated by the membrane - deform - ing activities of Syndapin 2 and another NPF - containing protein , MI - CAL - L1 ( Giridharan et al . , 2013 ) . However , the combined membrane - remodeling activities that might arise in vivo from the shared functions of C - terminal EHD and NPF - containing proteins remain unclear . The Drosophila neuromuscular junction ( NMJ ) is a powerful sys - tem in which to study membrane remodeling .

Koles et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and also contain Dlg ( Razzaq et al . , 2001 ; Supplemental Figure S1A ) . Finally , whereas muscle - specific RNAi revealed negligible expression of Past1 in the motor neuron ( Figure 1C ) , ectopic presynaptic expression of Past1 - EGFP induced the formation of extensive tubules emanating from the presynaptic arbor , consistent with Past1 having a robust mem - brane deformation activity . These tubules contained presynaptic membrane marker HRP but were not enriched for the presynaptic proteins we tested ( Supplemental Figure S1B ) , suggesting that they exclude presynaptic cytoplasm and ultrastructures . Given the localization of Past1 to the NMJ and its expected role in membrane remodeling , we next examined the morphology of this synapse in past1 60 - 4 / 110 - 1 - null mutants ( Olswang - Kutz et al . , 2009 ) . Whereas total bouton number was similar to that for wild - type animals ( Figure 1E and Supplemental Table S1 ) , past1 mutants exhibited a marked defect in synaptic bouton shape . Boutons were less round than wild - type boutons , often with ragged edges ( Figure 1E ) . We also found a significant increase in the frequency of ghost boutons ( Figure 1 , F and G ) , defined by the dramatic reduc - tion or absence of a postsynaptic marker ( Dlg ) at α - HRP – labeled type Ib and type Is boutons on muscles 6 and 7 , which are particu - larly sensitive to this phenotype ( Ataman et al . , 2008 ) . However , the amount of postsynaptically localized α - HRP labeling ( representing shed neuronal membrane debris ; Fuentes - Medel et al . , 2009 ) was similar in wild type and past1 mutants , suggesting that ghost bou - tons did not arise from excessive presynaptic membrane shedding ( Figure 1H ) . The NMJ morphology and ghost bouton phenotype were rescued by reexpression of Past1 - EGFP in muscles ( Figure 1 , E – G ) . Therefore Past1 is required postsynaptically for normal syn - aptic morphogenesis . Past1 is required for synaptic transmission and homeostasis To test the effects of Past1 on NMJ function , we next examined synaptic transmission in past1 mutants . The larval NMJs to which Past1 localizes are glutamatergic synapses and depend on a gluta - mate receptor ( GluR ) tetramer consisting of the invariant subunits GluRIIC , GluRIID , and GlurIIE and the variable subunits GluRIIA and GluRIIB , which determine the electrophysiological properties of the receptor ( DiAntonio et al . , 1999 ; Marrus et al . , 2004 ) . At the larval NMJ , GluRIIA - containing complexes are believed to represent na - scent synapses , whereas GluRIIB complexes are believed to repre - sent more mature , stable synapses ( Thomas and Sigrist , 2012 ) . In addition , this NMJ exhibits robust homeostasis in response to re - duced activity of glutamate receptors , responding with an increase in presynaptic release dependent on a retrograde signal and Ca 2 + influx ( Petersen et al . , 1997 ; Frank , 2014 ) . To determine the role of Past1 in glutamatergic signaling at the NMJ , we immunostained past1 mutants with glutamate receptor – specific antibodies and found a specific reduction in the levels of GluRIIA but not of GluRIIB or GluRIIC ( Figure 2 , A and B ) . Despite reduced GluRIIA levels , Glu - RIIC clusters in past1 mutants were apposed normally to presynaptic active zones marked by Bruchpilot ( BRP ) ( Figure 2C ) , suggesting that synapse formation was not affected . We then used electrophysiology to examine the functional con - sequences of loss of Past1 . Compared to controls , past1 - mutant NMJs exhibited strongly reduced spontaneous miniature excitatory postsynaptic potentials ( mEPSPs ; Figure 2 , D and E ) , as well as dampened evoked postsynaptic potentials ( EPSPs ; Figure 2 , D and F ) . The frequency of mEPSPs was also depressed ( Figure 2G ) , per - haps because reduced mEPSP amplitude precludes detection of some events . Strikingly , quantal content was not increased to com - pensate for mEPSP amplitude reduction ( Figure 2H ) , suggesting a side of the NMJ , a highly convoluted array of muscle membrane infoldings called the subsynaptic reticulum ( SSR ) incorporates neu - rotransmitter receptors , ion channels , and cell adhesion molecules . Assembly of the SSR during larval growth involves activity - depen - dent targeted exocytosis mediated by the small GTPase Ral and its effector , the exocyst complex ( Teodoro et al . , 2013 ) , as well as the t - SNARE ( target soluble N - ethylmaleimide – sensitive factor attach - ment protein receptor ) receptor gtaxin / Syx18 ( Gorczyca et al . , 2007 ) and scaffolding proteins such as Discs Large ( Dlg ; Lahey et al . , 1994 ) . Many proteins with predicted membrane - remodeling activi - ties , including Drosophila homologues of Syndapin ( Synd ) and Am - phiphysin ( Amph ) , localize extensively to SSR membranes , making them prime candidates to facilitate SSR elaboration ( Leventis et al . , 2001 ; Razzaq et al . , 2001 ; Zelhof et al . , 2001 ; Kumar et al . , 2009b ) . Amph regulates the postsynaptic turnover of the trans - synaptic cell adhesion molecule FasII ( Mathew et al . , 2003 ) , but its role in orga - nizing the SSR is unknown . The Drosophila melanogaster genome encodes a single C - termi - nal EHD protein called Putative achaete / scute target ( Past1 ) . Past1 mutants exhibit defects in endocytic recycling in larval nephrocytes , sterility and aberrant development of the germline , and short lifespan ( Olswang - Kutz et al . , 2009 ) , but the functions of Past1 at the NMJ have not been explored . Mammalian EHD1 localizes to the mouse NMJ , but its function there has been difficult to ascertain , perhaps due to redundancy with other EHD proteins ( Mate et al . , 2012 ) . Here we take advantage of the fact that Past1 encodes the only Drosophila C - terminal EHD protein and define its role at the NMJ . RESULTS Past1 localizes to the SSR and is required for proper SSR assembly We first investigated a potential role for Past1 in the neuromuscular system by examining its localization at the larval NMJ relative to the neuronal membrane marker anti – horseradish peroxidase ( α - HRP ) and the presynaptic and postsynaptic scaffolding protein Dlg . Larval muscles are innervated by glutamatergic type Ib NMJs ( which are surrounded by extensive SSR and Dlg ) , glutamatergic type Is NMJs ( which are surrounded by a much thinner layer of SSR and Dlg ) , and peptidergic type II and III NMJs ( which lack both SSR and Dlg ; Prokop , 2006 ) . Polyclonal α - Past1 antibodies ( Olswang - Kutz et al . , 2009 ) revealed endogenous Past1 localization at the NMJ to type Ib and Is arbors but not to type II or type III arbors ( Figure 1A ) , suggest - ing that Past1 localizes specifically to SSR - surrounded NMJs . Past1 localized to a postsynaptic domain larger than that defined by Dlg and decorated frequent tubule - like extensions into the muscle ( Figure 1B , arrows ) . This Past1 immunolabeling disappeared in past1 - null mutants and was lost after postsynaptic depletion of Past1 by RNA interference ( RNAi ) , confirming the specificity of the labeling ( Figure 1C ) . Localization of Past1 to the SSR was recapitu - lated using a Past1 – enhanced green fluorescent protein ( EGFP ) transgene driven by the muscle driver BG487 - GAL4 ( Figure 1D ) . By contrast , the mutant Past1 G62E - EGFP protein ( analogous to muta - tions in mammalian and C . elegans EHD1 / rme - 1 , which abolish ATP binding and membrane association ; Lee et al . , 2005 ) was diffusely localized in the muscle , with only a small degree of enrichment at the NMJ ( Figure 1D ) , indicating that ATP binding and membrane binding by Past1 are required for its localization . Past1 also localized to tubulovesicular structures in the muscle cortex ( Figure 1B and Supplemental Figure S1A ) and to Dlg - labeled muscle – muscle junctions . Of interest , however , it did not localize to t - tubules , which are prominent deep invaginations of the muscle plasma membrane that couple muscle membrane depolarization to Volume 26 September 15 , 2015 Function of Past1 at the Drosophila NMJ | 3277 microscopy of the membrane markers mCD8 - GFP and myr - mRFP ( Figure 3A ) . Thus Past1 is required for normal development and morphology of the SSR . Past1 functionally interacts with Synd and colocalizes with Amph Synd and Amph are two NPF motif – containing membrane - remodel - ing proteins that localize to SSR at the Drosophila larval NMJ ( Leventis et al . , 2001 ; Razzaq et al . , 2001 ; Zelhof et al . , 2001 ; Kumar et al . , 2009b ) and interact with EHD proteins in other systems ( Xu et al . , 2004 ; Braun et al . , 2005 ; Pant et al . , 2009 ) . Amph - A is the only one of three Drosophila Amphiphysin splice isoforms that contains an NPF motif ( Zelhof et al . , 2001 ) , whereas all predicted Drosophila Synd isoforms contain a single NPF motif ( Figure 4A ) . To test whether Synd and Amph might function with Drosophila Past1 , we expressed them in cultured Drosophila S2 cells . Past1 - EGFP local - ized to tubular and punctate structures in these cells ( Figure 4B ) . By contrast , the ATP - binding mutant Past1 G62E - GFP localized primarily to the cytoplasm and infrequent aggregates , whereas Past1 lacking its NPF - interacting EH domain ( Past1 ∆ EH - EGFP ) localized primarily to the cytoplasm ( Figure 4B ) . Thus Past1 requires its ATP / membrane - binding capacity as well as its EH domain for localization in S2 cells . Amph - A localized to small puncta , as did an Amph NPF motif mu - tant in which the conserved EH domain – interacting phenylalanine was replaced with alanine ( Figure 4C ; Pant et al . 2009 ) . The isolated Synd F - BAR domain localized to short tubules and puncta , often emanating in a radial pattern from the center of the cell , whereas full - length Synd localized mainly to the cytoplasm and only weakly to puncta , consistent with previous results demonstrating autoinhi - bition of the Synd F - BAR by its SH3 domain ( Kumar et al . , 2009b ; Rao et al . , 2010 ; Figure 4D ) . We mutated the conserved phenylala - nine in the NPF motif of Synd to alanine ( Synd NPFmut ) and found a similar localization to wild - type Synd ( Figure 4D ) . We first tested the effects of coexpression of Amph and Past1 - EGFP in S2 cells . Past1 - EGFP colocalized with a fraction of Amph - positive puncta , and this localization was retained when the Amph NPF motif was mutated ( Figure 4C ) . These results suggest that colo - calization does not depend on Past1 EH domain – Amph NPF motif interactions , although Past1 and Amph can be recruited to the same cellular structures . We next tested the effects of Past1 on Synd local - ization . Strikingly , when coexpressed with Past1 - EGFP , Synd - mCherry partially relocalized from the cytoplasm to a radial pattern , reminiscent of its isolated F - BAR , and Past1 - EGFP colocalized with these structures ( Figure 4C ) . By contrast , Past1 - EGFP colocalized significantly less with structures formed by the isolated Synd F - BAR , which is missing the Past1 - interacting NPF motif ( Figure 4D ) . Fur - ther , the Synd NPFmut mutant exhibited reduced colocalization with Past1 compared with wild - type Synd . These results suggest that in S2 cells , Past1 ( either directly or indirectly ) interacts with and re - leases Synd from autoinhibition , revealing a membrane - binding ac - tivity similar to its isolated F - BAR . Taken together , these data sug - gest that functional interactions between Past1 and Synd are likely to be conserved for the Drosophila homologues of these proteins . Finally , we found that Past1 - EGFP , Synd - mCherry , and Amph - myc colocalized in puncta when expressed together in S2 cells ( Supple - mental Figure S2 ) , indicating that they can associate with the same structures in vivo . Past1 organizes distinct SSR domains defined by Amph and Synd To understand how Past1 sculpts the SSR , we examined its effects on the localization of Amph and Synd at the NMJ . In wild - type defect in synaptic homeostasis . To test this possibility , we used the null mutation GluRIIA SP16 , representing a challenge to postsynaptic function that produces a robust homeostatic response ( Petersen et al . , 1997 ) . Compared to past1 single mutants , we found that past1 ; GluRIIA SP16 double mutants exhibited a further reduction in mEPSP amplitude ( Figure 2 , D and E ) . These mEPSPs in past1 ; GluRIIA SP16 mutants were very similar in amplitude to GluRIIA SP16 single mutants ( Figure 2E ) , suggesting that the reduction in mEPSP amplitude in past1 mutants is predominantly due to diminished Glu - RIIA levels . Remarkably , although we observed robust homeostatic compensation in GluRIIA SP16 single mutants ( as evidenced by in - creased quantal content ) , GluRIIA SP16 ; past1 double mutants had the same diminished quantal content as past1 single mutants ( Figure 2H ) . These results indicate that past1 mutants have a specific and strong defect in synaptic homeostasis . Past1 organizes the subsynaptic reticulum Past1 is a membrane - remodeling protein , and the defects in synap - tic morphology , transmission , and homeostasis that we observed may be due to a direct role in organizing postsynaptic membranes . To test the role of Past1 in the SSR , we examined the organization of postsynaptic membranes using a muscle - expressed myris - toylated monomeric red fluorescent protein ( myr - mRFP , targeted to membranes via fatty acid modification ) or mCD8 - GFP ( targeted to membranes using the transmembrane domain of mouse CD8 ) . Both reporters localized strongly to the SSR in control and past1 - mutant NMJs but were found partly concentrated in nodules at past1 - mutant NMJs ( Figure 3A , arrows ) . Myr - mRFP is predicted to diffuse readily within membranes , so we used it as a reporter for mobility within membranes in the SSR , using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) analysis . At the resolution of light microscopy , myr - mRFP intensity and vol - ume were unchanged between wild - type and past1 - mutant NMJs ( Figure 3B ) . On photobleaching a string of terminal boutons in either wild - type or past1 mutants , myr - mRFP recovered first in the proximal bouton and last in the distal bouton ( Figure 3C , arrows ) , indicating that membrane diffusion occurs primarily between the SSR of adjacent boutons rather than between the NMJ and the muscle cortex . In past1 mutants , myr - mRFP exhibited a similar re - covery rate but a significantly higher mobile fraction than in wild - type animals , suggesting that the SSR reticulum may have re - duced complexity , allowing more extensive membrane exchange ( Figure 3C and Supplemental Movies S1 and S2 ) . To examine further the ultrastructure of the mutant NMJ , we used transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) . The past1 - mutant boutons exhibited normal presynaptic structures , including synaptic vesicles and active zones ( Figure 3D ) . TEM of wild - type type 1b bou - tons revealed a highly elaborated postsynaptic reticulum ( Figure 3D ) . In striking contrast , Past1 - mutant type 1b boutons exhibited aber - rant SSR membranes , often separated into distinct nodules . Further , a fraction of the nodules ( 5 of 12 nodules ; n = 5 boutons ) exhibited a central core ( yellow arrow ) surrounded by long membrane exten - sions ∼ 20 nm wide in cross section ( Figure 3D , red arrow ) . Nodules were not seen in wild - type samples ( n = 5 boutons ) . Because thin tubules would be unlikely to extend so frequently and for such long distances in the plane of the thin section , it is likely that these exten - sions represent flat membrane sheets . We tested this possibility by conducting serial section electron microscopy on NMJs and indeed found that the long membrane extensions in nodules continued through multiple ∼ 70 - nm sections ( Figure 3E ) , consistent with the hypothesis that they represent membrane sheets . These membrane nodules are likely to correspond to the nodules seen by confocal 3278 | K . Koles et al .

Finally , we tested the role of Past1 ATP binding / membrane bind - ing in the consolidation of the Synd - labeled membrane domain into nodules . First , we confirmed that postsynaptic reexpression of Past1 - EGFP ( using the muscle driver BG57 - GAL4 ) in the past1 mu - tant rescued the SSR distribution of Synd ( Supplemental Figure S4 ) . By contrast , control larvae expressing mCD8 - GFP in the past1 - mu - tant background exhibited Synd nodules , with which mCD8 - GFP colocalized . The ATP / membrane - binding mutant Past1 G62E - EGFP failed to rescue the Synd nodule phenotype and localized to the nodules ( Supplemental Figure S4 ) . Taken together , our results indi - cate that ATP / membrane binding by Past1 is required to fully elabo - rate the SSR and that , in its absence , a membrane domain defined by Amph aberrantly surrounds a domain defined by Synd . Amph is required to consolidate Synd into nodules To test the order of action of Amph and Synd microdomains in post - synaptic membrane elaboration , we examined the localization of Synd in amph ; past1 double mutants by confocal microscopy . Strik - ingly , in these double mutants , Synd was no longer localized to nod - ules but instead was strongly depleted from the NMJ , and its overall levels in the muscle were slightly but significantly reduced ( Figure 6 , A and B ) . By contrast , amph single mutants had Synd levels similar to those of wild - type NMJs ( Figure 6 , A and B ) . This result suggests that Amph is required to pack Synd into the nodules that form in past1 mutants and that in the absence of NMJ localization , Synd may be destabilized . We next used confocal microscopy to assess the localization of Dlg as a proxy for overall SSR organization . Dlg was localized to a slightly but significantly larger domain in amph single mutants than in past1 single mutants ( Figure 6 , A and C ) . In contrast to the dra - matic mislocalization of Synd , amph ; past1 mutant NMJs did not have significantly different Dlg volume or intensity than wild - type or past1 - mutant NMJs . This suggests that unpacking of Synd nodules and mislocalization of Synd from the SSR in amph ; past1 mutants are specific to the Synd structure rather than due to a general loss of SSR . Of importance , GluRIIA levels were similar in amph ; past1 dou - ble mutants compared with past1 single mutants ( Figure 6D ) , sug - gesting that loss of GluRIIA is a general property of past1 mutants and not an indirect effect of Synd nodule formation . To examine further the phenotype of amph ; past1 double mutants , we examined their SSR organization by TEM . The amph - mutant SSR had a similar appearance to wild - type SSR ( Figure 6E ) . Further , in contrast to past1 single - mutant SSR , we did not observe any nodules or concentric membrane sheets in the amph ; past1 double - mutant SSR ( Figure 6E ) . Thus we conclude that in the animals , Synd and Amph were found at the NMJ in uniformly dis - tributed small postsynaptic puncta ( Figure 5A ) , consistent with pre - vious reports that they colocalize with postsynaptic Dlg ( Kumar et al . , 2009a , b ) . However , in past1 - mutant NMJs , both Synd and Amph were strikingly mislocalized to nodules close to the presynap - tic membrane ( Figure 5A ) . Nodules appeared in 82 % of past1 - mu - tant NMJs ( but no wild - type NMJs ; Supplemental Figure S3A ) and were distinct from the presynaptic active zone marker BRP , which labels synapses ( Supplemental Figure S3B ) . These nodules coin - cided with indentations of the presynaptic membrane ( Figure 5B , arrows ) and colocalized strongly with the postsynaptically expressed membrane marker mCD8 - GFP ( Figure 5C ) , suggesting that Synd and Amph nodules represent the membrane structures seen by TEM . Further , Synd nodules were recapitulated by RNAi knockdown of Past1 in muscles , indicating that they arise due to lack of postsyn - aptic Past1 function ( Figure 5D ) . We next tested whether Synd and Amph levels were altered in past1 - mutant NMJs and found that whereas total levels were unchanged at the NMJ ( Figure 5E ) , there was a higher fraction of Synd - and Amph - positive pixels at higher fluorescence intensities relative to wild - type NMJs , consistent with the observed increased clustering of both Synd and Amph in the nodules ( Figure 5F ) . We next tested the localization of a number of additional post - synaptic components in past1 mutants by confocal microscopy . We found that the BAR domain – containing protein dRich ( Nahm et al . , 2010b ) and the F - BAR protein dCip4 ( Nahm et al . , 2010a ) were lo - calized to structures very similar to Synd nodules ( Supplemental Figure S3C ) . The postsynaptic scaffolding molecules Dlg and spec - trin , which are not believed to bind to EHD proteins like Past1 , were also mislocalized , forming a honeycomb pattern around the NMJ ( Supplemental Figure S3D ) . Thus loss of Past1 causes significant re - organization of postsynaptic membrane - associated and scaffolding proteins . To understand further the organization of SSR components in past1 mutants , we used structured illumination microscopy ( SIM ) , with which we could image their organization beyond the diffraction limit of conventional fluorescence microscopy . In wild - type animals , SIM revealed Synd localization in a punctate pattern , along tubules that extended beyond the Dlg domain ( Figure 5G ) , similar to Past1 localization ( Figure 1B ) and providing increased resolution over pre - vious studies ( Kumar et al . , 2009a , b ) . In wild - type animals , Amph localized in small puncta that closely overlapped with the Dlg do - main of the SSR ( Figure 5G ) . Thus , in wild - type animals , Synd local - izes to a more extensive SSR domain than Amph . By contrast , inten - sity profiles averaged across multiple past1 - mutant nodules revealed that Synd localized to the center of the nodule , whereas Amph la - beled a region larger than the central domain and Dlg occupied a further domain on the muscle side of the nodule ( Figure 5 , G and H ) . Thus the relative positions of Synd and Amph in the SSR are reversed in past1 - mutant NMJs . These results suggest that the aberrant localization to endogenous Past1 , whereas an ATP - binding mutant ( contrast enhanced ) is largely cytoplasmic .

Volume 26 September 15 , 2015 Function of Past1 at the Drosophila NMJ | 3281 perhaps due to redundancy with other membrane - remodeling pro - teins . In fact , in addition to Amph and Synd , we found that the BAR proteins Cip4 and dRich are localized to nodules in past1 mutants ( Supplemental Figure S3 ) , suggesting that multiple membrane - re - modeling proteins are available to function in the Past1 - dependent pathway . In the future , it will be important to build into our working model the additional roles of these and other SSR - localized mem - brane - remodeling proteins , as well as the timing of exocyst - depen - dent membrane addition ( Teodoro et al . , 2013 ) . Role of Past1 in NMJ development and function Our results demonstrate that postsynaptic Past1 plays critical roles in the structure and function of the Drosophila NMJ . Past1 mutant NMJs exhibit aberrant morphology and excess ghost boutons . These ghost boutons are unlikely to be due to defective clearance of excess neuronal membrane as previously described ( Fuentes - Medel et al . , 2009 ) , since we did not observe large amounts of neu - ronal debris ( Figure 1H ) . They are also unlikely to be related to ex - cess ghost boutons seen in Wingless ( Wg ) signaling pathway mutants ( Ataman et al . , 2006 , 2008 ) , since past1 mutants do not phenocopy many other aspects of reduced Wg signaling , including increased GluR levels , disrupted presynaptic function , and reduc - tion in bouton number ( Packard et al . , 2002 ; Speese et al . , 2012 ) . The likeliest interpretation is that Past1 functions directly in SSR membrane elaboration , consistent with our EM observations , and ghost boutons may arise when membrane nodules become too se - vere to allow SSR assembly around boutons that form toward the end of larval development . Another prominent synaptic phenotype that we found in past1 mutants is a strong and specific reduction in localization of GluRIIA to postsynaptic specializations , resulting in decreased mEPSP ampli - tude ( Figure 2 ) . This decrease in GluRIIA could potentially arise by many mechanisms , including altered transcriptional or translational regulation or GluR traffic to or from the synapse . Indeed , expression of a dominant - negative EHD1 suppresses AMPA ( α - amino - 3 - hydroxy - 5 - methyl - 4 - isoxazolepropionic acid – type ) glutamate recep - tor recycling in hippocampal dendritic spines ( Park et al . , 2004 ) . Al - though there has been little evidence that Drosophila GluRs are regulated by membrane traffic , our data implicating the membrane - remodeling protein Past1 indicate that this may be the case . Finally , unlike the great majority of perturbations that reduce GluRIIA levels ( reviewed in Frank , 2014 ) , past1 mutants surprisingly fail to compen - sate for this loss by homeostatic up - regulation of presynaptic release , suggesting that Past1 could be involved in relaying an as - yet - uniden - tified retrograde signal for synaptic homeostasis . Further work ex - ploring mechanisms of GluRIIA regulation and retrograde signaling will be required to understand the role of Past1 in these events . Our present data cannot distinguish whether the function of Past1 in GluR traffic or homeostasis is directly related to its role in SSR elaboration , and it is possible that membrane compartments inde - pendent of the SSR are required for these functions and are dis - rupted in the mutant . Our finding that GluRIIA levels are still reduced in amph ; past1 double mutants although SSR nodules are sup - pressed ( Figure 6D ) supports the conclusion that GluR localization defects are independent of aberrant SSR morphogenesis . Of note , absence of Past1 , Amph - dependent membrane sheets are required to consolidate or pack a Synd domain , and these events lead to dysfunctional elaboration of the SSR . DISCUSSION Roles of Past1 , Synd , and Amph in membrane elaboration Although there is great diversity in the morphologies of subcellular membranes and organelles , we have relatively little understanding of the mechanisms by which these complex shapes are generated . Here we uncovered novel functional roles in membrane remodeling at the NMJ for Past1 , the sole C - terminal EHD protein in Drosophila . Putting together our observations at the NMJ and in S2 cells with previous results from other groups , we propose a new working model for how Past1 functions in synaptic membrane elaboration ( Figure 7 ) . Our first key observation is that Past1 is required for nor - mal elaboration of the SSR and that this function depends on its ATP - binding and thus membrane - remodeling activity . Next we found that in wild - type SSR , Amph localizes to a domain proximal to the bouton , whereas Past1 and Synd localize to a more extended tubu - lovesicular domain . By contrast , in the absence of Past1 , the SSR re - arranges into highly organized subdomains , with a core of Synd sur - rounded by a shell of Amph ( likely corresponding to membrane sheets seen in Figure 3D by transmission electron microscopy [ TEM ] ) . We found that Amph is required for the formation of the sheets ( per - haps by regulating the tight curvature at the tips of these membrane structures ) and for consolidation of Synd into nodules . Further , our FRAP data indicate that the nodules result in significantly increased membrane flow within the SSR relative to wild - type SSR , suggesting reduced complexity . Finally , our S2 cell data indicate that Past1 may activate the membrane - binding / remodeling activity of Synd . These results suggest a novel mechanism for SSR elaboration at the wild - type NMJ involving sequential steps of membrane remod - eling ( Figure 7 ) . In this model , Amph localizes and generates mem - brane tubules proximal to the bouton , and Past1 and Synd work together to further elaborate the tubules distal to the bouton . Suc - cessive rounds of these events could lead to the growth and expan - sion of layers of reticulum . In past1 mutants , this process is severely compromised , resulting in nodules containing a core of inactive Synd packed by Amph - dependent membrane sheets . One issue that remains to be resolved is whether direct physical interactions among Past1 , Amph , and Synd ( within the SSR subdo - mains to which they colocalize ) contribute to Past1 - dependent membrane remodeling at the NMJ , as they do in other systems ( Xu et al . , 2004 ; Braun et al . , 2005 ; Pant et al . , 2009 ) . Our S2 cell data ( Figure 4 ) suggest that Past1 and Synd functionally interact in vivo . However , we were unable to biochemically detect Past1 - Amph or Past1 - Synd complexes using coprecipitation experiments in extracts from Drosophila larvae or S2 cells or with purified proteins ( unpub - lished results ) , suggesting that either they do not directly interact or their interactions are not preserved in solution under the conditions tested . Genetic experiments at the NMJ using mutations that dis - rupt putative Past1 - Synd and Past1 - Amph interactions are unlikely to be informative because synd and amph single mutants exhibit no dramatic phenotype in SSR organization ( Leventis et al . , 2001 ; Razzaq et al . , 2001 ; Zelhof et al . , 2001 ; Kumar et al . , 2009b ) , 10 μm .

Otherwise , α - HRP antibodies and secondary antibodies for imaging were conjugated to Dylight 405 , Dylight 488 , Rhodamine Red - X , or Alexa 647 ( Jackson ImmunoResearch , West Grove , PA ) . Immunohistochemistry , imaging , and analysis of NMJ morphology For analysis of NMJ morphology and protein localization at the NMJ , flies were cultured at controlled density at 25ºC . Wandering third - instar larvae were dissected in calcium - free HL3 . 1 saline ( Feng et al . , 2004 ) and fixed in HL3 . 1 containing 4 % formaldehyde ( or Bouin’s fix for α - GlurRIIA , α - spectrin , and Cip4 staining ) before anti - body staining . For analysis of NMJ morphology , NMJs on muscle 6 / 7 and muscle 4 , segment A3 , were selected . Spinning - disk confocal Z - stacks ( 0 . 3 μm ) were collected at room temperature on an Andor spinning - disk confocal system consisting of a Nikon Ni - E upright microscope equipped with 60 × ( numerical aperture [ NA ] 1 . 4 ) and 100 × ( NA 1 . 45 ) oil immersion objectives , a Yokogawa CSU - W1 spinning - disk head , and an Andor iXon 897U electron - multiplying charge - coupled device camera ( Andor , Belfast , Northern Ireland ) . Images were collected using NIS Elements AR software ( Nikon , Melville , NY ) . Laser scanning confocal images were acquired at room temperature on a Leica SP5 confocal microscope equipped with an HCX PL APO lambda blue 63 . 0 × ( NA 1 . 4 ) oil im - mersion objective and Leica software ( Leica , Wetzlar , Germany ) . SIM images were collected at room temperature on a Nikon N - SIM instrument equipped with an Apo TIRF 100 × ( NA 1 . 4 ) objective . Images were acquired using a violet - to - red diffraction grating at three angles and five phases of illumination , producing 15 raw images for SIM analysis using NIS Elements software . For TEM , samples were fixed , embedded , and sectioned as pre - viously described ( Karnovsky , 1965 ) . Sections were imaged on a JEOL 1200EX 80 - kV electron microscope at 6500 , 8000 , or 12 , 000 × magnification ( JEOL , Peabody , MA ) . Data were collected from type Ib boutons , defined by their extensive SSR . Live imaging and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching Wandering third - instar larvae were dissected in HL3 . 1 saline , and the CNS was removed . Type Ib NMJs on muscle 4 were imaged on a spinning - disk confocal microscope ( see earlier description ) with a 60 × water - dipping objective ( NA 1 . 0 ) . From three to 10 confocal stacks many mutants with severely defective SSR and / or reduced GluR lev - els exhibit normal homeostasis ( e . g . , GluRIIA , which also has reduced SSR ( Petersen et al . , 1997 ; Schmid et al . , 2006 ) ; Dlg ( Budnik et al . , 1996 ) ; Gtaxin , ( Gorczyca et al . , 2007 ) ; and Pak1 ( Albin and Davis , 2004 ) , suggesting that homeostasis is a specific function of Past1 rather than a general SSR - or GluR - related defect . Conservation of C - terminal EHD protein function at the NMJ Past1 represents the sole EHD homologue in Drosophila , whereas mammals express four EHD proteins with distinct functions ( Naslavsky and Caplan , 2011 ) . Of importance , many of the roles we defined for EHD proteins at the NMJ and in muscle are likely to be conserved . Past1 localizes to the NMJ , the muscle cortex , and myo - tendinous junctions ( Supplemental Figure S1 ) . However , unlike EHD1 ( Posey et al . , 2014 ) , Past1 does not significantly localize to t - tubules . The activities we identified for Past1 at the Drosophila NMJ may inform mechanisms by which EHD2 participates in sarcolemmal repair at the muscle cortex ( Marg et al . , 2012 ) , EHD3 functions in cardiac muscle physiology ( Curran et al . , 2014 ) , and EHD1 and EHD4 act at the mouse NMJ ( Mate et al . , 2012 ) . Our findings set the stage for uncovering how neuromuscular synapses are formed and elaborated and illustrate how cooperation between lipid - remodel - ing proteins can create highly complex membrane structures . MATERIALS AND METHODS Fly stocks Flies were cultured using standard media and techniques . UAS - Past1 - EGFP and UAS - Past1 G62E - EGFP lines were constructed in pBI - UASC - Gateway ( Wang et al . , 2011 ) using the PAST1 - RB transcript and inserted into the Attp40 locus ( Markstein et al . , 2008 ) on Drosophila chromosome II at Genetic Services ( Cambridge , MA ) .

Synd and Amph pixel intensity distributions at the NMJ were calculated in ImageJ from sum intensity projections of confocal stacks . The α - HRP – positive presynaptic area was dilated by 1 . 5 μm to define the postsynaptic region . Images were then normalized to the mean Synd / Amph intensity in this area , and pixel intensity distributions were calculated using the Sixteen Bit Histogram plugin in Image - J .

Statistical significance was calculated using GraphPad Prism software using analysis of vari - ance followed by pairwise Tukey’s tests or using Student’s t tests where only two groups were compared ; * p < 0 . 05 , * * p < 0 . 01 , * * * p < 0 . 005 ; n . s . , not significantly different . were collected for the prebleach intensity before two to three regions / NMJ were bleached using a Mosaic 3 photoillumination device equipped with a 450 - mW , 405 - nm laser ( Andor ) . Fluorescence recov - ery was measured by collecting confocal stacks at 10 - s intervals for 450 s . Z - drift was corrected by manually selecting an in - focus range of confocal slices , and XY drift was corrected automatically using the Image registration function in NIS Elements software . Fluorescence recovery in two - dimensional ( 2D ) projections of these confocal stacks were normalized to prebleach ( 1 ) and postbleach ( 0 ) fluorescence in - tensities and analyzed with GraphPad Prism ( GraphPad , La Jolla , CA ) . S2 Cell culture and imaging S2 cells ( Cherbas and Cherbas , 1998 ) were cultured according to standard protocols in Schneider’s medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum and 0 . 1 mg / ml penicillin / streptomycin . Past1 - EGFP and Past1 G62E - EGFP were described earlier . Past1 ∆ EH - EGFP was generated by deleting sequences coding amino acids 417 – 534 of Past1 . Synd ( isoform A ) - mCherry and Synd F - BAR - mCherry ( amino acids 1 – 300 , as previously described in Becalska et al . 2013 ) were generated in pBI - UASc ( Wang et al . , 2011 ) . Amph - A was con - structed in pUAST and tagged with five copies of the myc epitope . Site - directed mutagenesis was used to generate Amph - A F516A ( Amph - A NPFmut ) and Syndapin F418A ( Syndapin NPFmut ) . Constructs were cotransfected with Actin - GAL4 using Effectene reagent ( Qiagen , Valencia , CA ) and incubated for 2 – 3 d at 25°C . Cells were spread for 1 h on coverslips coated with concanavalin A ( Rogers et al . , 2003 ; Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) , fixed for 10 min in 4 % formaldehyde in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) , and then , where indicated , permeabilized , stained with primary and secondary anti - bodies , and washed with PBS plus 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 . Samples were mounted in Mowiol with DABCO ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , and cells were imaged by spinning - disk confocal microscopy as described earlier . Electrophysiology and analysis Wandering third - instar larvae were chosen for electrophysiology . Lar - vae were dissected in a modified HL3 saline : NaCl ( 70 mM ) , KCl ( 5 mM ) , MgCl 2 ( 10 mM ) , NaHCO 3 ( 10 mM ) , sucrose ( 115 mM = 3 . 9 % ) , trehalose ( 4 . 2 mM = 0 . 16 % ) , HEPES ( 4 - ( 2 - hydroxyethyl ) - 1 - piperazineethanesulfonic acid ; 5 . 0 mM = 0 . 12 % ) , and CaCl 2 ( 0 . 5 mM ) . Sharp electrode recordings were taken from muscle 6 of abdominal segment A2 or A3 , as previously described ( Davis et al . , 1998 ; Frank et al . , 2006 ) . Data were collected using an Axopatch 200B amplifier ( Molecular Devices , Sunnyvale , CA ) , digitized using a Digidata 1440A data acquisition system ( Molecular Devices ) , and recorded with pCLAMP 10 acquisition software ( Molecular Devices ) . For presynaptic nerve stimulation , a Master - 8 pulse stimulator ( A . M . P . Instruments , Jerusalem , Israel ) and an ISO - Flex isolation unit ( A . M . P . Instruments ) were used to deliver 1 - ms suprathreshold stimuli to the appropriate segmental nerve . The average spontaneous miniature EPSP ( mEPSP ) amplitude was quantified by measuring the amplitude of ∼ 100 – 200 individual spontaneous release events per NMJ . The average evoked EPSP amplitude was calculated for each NMJ . Quantal content ( QC ) was determined for each NMJ by calculating the ratio of average EPSP and average mEPSP amplitudes . QC was corrected for nonlin - ear summation as described ( Martin , 1955 ) . Image and statistical analyses Analyses of postsynaptic volumes and volumetric intensities were conducted using the Volocity 5 . 5 Classification Module ( ImproVision , Waltham , MA ) . Volumes corresponding to presynaptic ( as determined by HRP ) labeling were determined using intensity thresholds , as previously described ( Ramachandran et al . , 2009 ) .
