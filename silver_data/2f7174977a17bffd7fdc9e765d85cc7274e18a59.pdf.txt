EVs can form by outward budding of the plasma membrane or by an intracellular endocytic trafficking path - way involving fusion of multivesicular late endocytic compartments ( multivesicular bodies ( MVBs ) ) with the plasma membrane , as described in the 1980s 4 , 5 ( Fig . 2 ) . Such fusion events result in the extracellular release of the intraluminal vesicles ( ILVs ) of these compartments , generating a subtype of EVs termed ‘exosomes’ 6 that have the same size as ILVs ( < 200 nm in diameter ) . Exosome secretion was initially proposed as a mechanism through which cells eliminate unnecessary proteins 4 , 5 . However , work in the late 1990s indicated that it could serve an intercellular communication purpose , especially in immune responses and cancer 7 , 8 . Strong sup - port for this concept came in 2007 , when exosomes were shown to contain mRNAs and microRNAs that , when transferred to recipi - ent cells , remained functional and changed cellular behaviour 9 . Concomitantly , EVs called microvesicles , microparticles or ecto - somes , presumably released from the plasma membrane , were also shown to transfer functional proteins and RNA between cells 10 , 11 . EVs of sizes similar to exosomes 12 – 14 or larger 15 – 17 have been observed to bud from the plasma membrane of the main cell body or mem - brane extensions ( for example , microvilli , filopodia , cilia and fla - gella ) ( Fig . 2 ) of various cell types . EVs in the size range of exosomes share the same biophysical characteristics in terms of size , density and membrane orientation ( Fig . 1 ) and , therefore , current methods cannot separate them efficiently . Depending on the cell type , envi - ronmental conditions and other factors ( for example , infection or artificial expression of molecules ) , the relative proportion of released MVB - derived exosomes versus other small EVs is highly variable and preparations obtained by most current protocols may contain a mixture of small EVs of endosomal ( namely , exosomes ) and non - endosomal origin 18 , as well as other lipid - based but non - vesicular structures , such as lipoproteins of various densities ( intermediate - , high - , low - or very - low - density lipoprotein ) 19 ( Fig . 1 ) , and the newly identified exomeres 20 . Recently 18 , exosomes enriched in late endo - some components were defined as a small EV subtype bearing the tetraspanins CD63 ( a protein accumulating in MVBs ) and CD9 / CD81 ( which are mainly at the plasma membrane ) , although this definition awaits validation in other cells and conditions . Numerous functions have been ascribed to EVs in many patho - physiological situations , including cancer , immune responses , cardiovascular diseases , regeneration and stem cell - based ther - apy 21 . Although many studies describe these functions as exosome specific , the potentially heterogeneous subcellular origin of EVs found in many exosome preparations indicates the broader func - tional relevance of multiple EV types . Here , we discuss some non - exhaustive examples of the specificities of exosomes and plasma membrane - derived EVs in terms of biogenesis and secretion , tar - geting to and delivery of content into recipient cells and consequent functionalities . Vesicle budding inside MVBs or at the plasma membrane An important feature shared by plasma membrane - derived EVs and endosome ILVs is that they bud away from the cytosol in contrast to other intracellular budding events that are required for trafficking between different compartments . Thus , their membrane orienta - tion is identical to that of the cell surface , exposing the extracellular domains of the transmembrane proteins and enclosing cytosolic components . Given that the known molecular mechanisms of biogenesis , secretion and interaction of EVs with target cells have been comprehensively reviewed elsewhere 22 , here , we describe key examples of the formation of vesicles inside MVBs ( that is , future exosomes ) , and whether and how these mechanisms apply to EVs forming at the plasma membrane ( Fig . 2 ) . ESCRT . The endosomal sorting complex required for transport ( ESCRT ) is a family of proteins that associate in successive com - plexes ( ESCRT - 0 , - I , - II and - III ) at the membrane of MVBs to regulate cargo targeting into and the formation of ILVs 23 . The pres - ence of tumour susceptibility gene 101 protein ( TSG101 ) and other ESCRT proteins or ESCRT - accessory molecules , for example , ALIX ( encoded by PDCD6IP ) and vacuolar protein sorting - associated protein 4 ( VPS4 ) , in the preparations of small EVs has often been offered as proof of their MVB origin . However , ESCRT factors are involved in various budding and membrane scission events at the plasma membrane , all of which require ESCRT - I / II / III and acces - sory molecules 23 , leading to EV release ( see examples in refs . 24 , 25 ) . ESCRT - 0 components are generally not described in plasma mem - brane budding and release models . Thus , ESCRT - 0 dependence of EV secretion could be a means to demonstrate their MVB origin . Accordingly , depletion of the ESCRT - 0 components HRS ( encoded by HGS ) or signal transducing adapter molecule 1 ( STAM1 ) in HeLa cells 26 decreases the secretion of small EVs bearing CD63 and major histocompatibility complex - II / CD81 , which correspond to exosomes according to ref . 18 . However , such approaches may induce Specificities of secretion and uptake of exosomes and other extracellular vesicles for cell - to - cell communication Mathilde Mathieu 1 , 2 , Lorena Martin - Jaular 1 , Grégory Lavieu 1 and Clotilde Théry 1 * The ability of exosomes to transfer cargo from donor to acceptor cells , thereby triggering phenotypic changes in the latter , has generated substantial interest in the scientific community . However , the extent to which exosomes differ from other extracellu - lar vesicles in terms of their biogenesis and functions remains ill - defined . Here , we discuss the current knowledge on the speci - ficities of exosomes and other types of extracellular vesicles , and their roles as important agents of cell - to - cell communication .

For instance , depleting HRS during human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection decreased viral release from the plasma membrane , by preventing degrada - tion of tetherin ( encoded by BST2 ) , which normally retains virions at the plasma membrane 27 . As tetherin also retains MVB - derived exosomes on plasma membrane patches 28 , these conditions may also reduce the secretion of both exosomes and plasma membrane - derived EVs . HRS binds to ubiquitin moieties to target proteins to ILVs 23 . However , the presence of ubiquitinated proteins in small EVs 29 , 30 cannot support their exosomal nature because the absence of ubiquitinated proteins from plasma membrane - derived EVs has not been established . Conversely , following cell exposure to type 1 interferons , the subsequent conjugation of proteins to the ubiquitin - like molecule ISG15 was shown to trigger MVB – lysosome fusion , thereby reducing exosome secretion 31 . However , given that one of the critical ISG15 targets was TSG101 , which is also required for the formation of plasma membrane - derived small EVs 24 , 25 , the reduced secretion observed following enhanced ISGylation may not be exclusive to exosomes . Lipids . Vesicle budding away from the cytosol involves cone - shaped lipids , such as ceramide , generated by sphingomyelin - ases 32 , 33 . Inhibiting neutral sphingomyelinase ( nSMAse - 2 ; encoded by SMPD3 ) was shown to prevent budding of ILVs in MVBs and exosome release by an ESCRT - independent mechanism 32 . Although this study did not explore their effects on other EVs , ceramide - inhibiting drugs ( especially GW4869 ) or nSMAse - 2 - targeting RNA ~ 50 – 150 nm ~ 100 – 1 , 000 nm ~ 100 – 5 , 000 nm Exosomes Microvesicles , ectosomes or microparticles Apoptotic EVs and apoptotic bodies Retroviruses 80 – 150 nm Exomeres ~ 30 – 50 nm HDL , LDL and IDL 5 – 35 nm VLDL and chylomicrons 20 – 1 , 200 nm EVs HDL VLDL and chylomicrons LDL and IDL 0 . 93 1 . 26 Density ( g ml – 1 ) 1 . 22 1 . 16 1 . 06 1 . 08 Fig . 1 | Physical characteristics of the different eV subtypes . Different EV subtypes are depicted together with other co - isolated particles . Schematized is the subcellular origin of these EVs ( endosomal or from the plasma membrane ) together with size and density ranges . Regardless of the secretion mechanisms , different EV subtypes cannot be fully separated according to size or density because of overlapping physical characteristics . For instance , this applies to small microvesicles , exosomes and enveloped viruses . Cellular debris , such as the apoptotic bodies or small apoptotic vesicles produced when cells undergo apoptosis 119 , might be undistinguishable from the other EVs . Other secreted particles that can be co - isolated with EVs include exomeres and different types of lipoproteins . Upon differential centrifugation of fluids containing these vesicles 18 , the largest ( for example , > 300 nm ) are recovered at a low speed ( around 2 , 000 g ) and a short time ( 20 – 30 minutes ) of centrifugation , followed by recovery of intermediate - size EVs of 150 – 300 nm at around 10 – 20 , 000 g for less than 30 minutes . The smallest EVs ( < 150 nm ) are mainly recovered after high - speed ultracentrifugation , but such preparations may include the smallest non - EV structures ( exomeres 20 and high - density lipoprotein ( HDL ) ) , especially if centrifugation is performed for an extended length of time . However , lipoproteins can be separated from EVs by combining size and density - based isolation methods 19 .

However , affecting the ceramide - generation pathway affects many other cellular properties 34 . Specifically , GW4869 can induce com - pensatory secretion of slightly larger plasma membrane - derived EVs 35 or cell death by an nSMAse - independent mechanism 36 . In addition , nSMAse controls general post - Golgi trafficking , and hence potentially all secretion 37 . Ceramide also regulates autophagy 38 that might indirectly affect MVB homeostasis . In general , effects on cell death and autophagy should be taken into account when interpret - ing the effects of compounds or modulation of gene expression on EV secretion . In C . elegans , externalization of phosphatidylethanolamine , which is normally maintained at the cytosolic face of the plasma membrane by a flippase , leads to EV budding and release 39 . In mam - malian cells , loss of phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanol - amine asymmetry also leads to plasma membrane - derived vesicle budding 40 , and two families of proteins with scramblase activity are involved in this process 41 . However , the effects of these mechanisms on exosome secretion have not been explored . Syndecan and syntenin . Specific targeting of a transmembrane protein into ILVs of MVBs can also occur through protein – pro - tein interactions 42 . Syntenin - 1 ( encoded by SDCBP ) binding to the cytosolic domain of syndecan - 1 recruits ALIX , which together with ESCRT - I – III components , allows inward bud - ding into ILVs and subsequent recovery of both syntenin and syndecan - 1 in exosome - containing pellets . This mechanism depends on Src - mediated syndecan - 1 endocytosis 43 and requires phospholipase D 2 and ADP - ribosylation factor 6 ( ARF6 ) GTPase activities 44 . However , this pathway may not be specific to MVB - derived exosomes in all cell types . In dendritic cells and adipo - cytes , syntenin is most abundant in small EVs , especially those corresponding to exosomes 18 , but is also detected in larger EVs 45 .

By contrast , externalization of phosphatidylethanolamine ( PE ) and phosphatidylserine ( PS ) may be more specifically involved in plasma membrane - derived EV secretion , and V - ATPase - mediated acidification of MVBs may be a specific control mechanism of exosome secretion , although V - ATPase inhibitors may also affect the Golgi V - ATPase .

MVB acidification . Progressive acidification along the endocytic pathway is required for degradation and recycling of internalized components 46 . Autophagy protein 5 ( Atg5 ) and Atg16L1 47 , which dissociate the E1 subunit of V1 - ATPase ( encoded by ATP6V1E1 ) and , therefore , abolish its proton transporter activity , or bafilomy - cin treatment 28 both reduce MVB acidification and were shown to increase exosome secretion in human cells . This suggests that pH could be a determinant of MVB function as secretory versus deg - radatory compartments . Alternatively , increased exosome secre - tion could be due to reduced endocytosis and degradation of the secreted exosomes in cells with altered MVB function , or due to indirect effects of bafilomycin on Golgi trafficking 48 . Although the present discussion of exosome biogenesis inside MVBs is not exhaustive , a key point to consider is that none of the currently known biogenesis mechanisms is fully specific to the exo - some pathway or valid in all cell types . intracellular trafficking for exosome and eV secretion The intracellular trafficking molecules that allow MVB transport to and fusion with the plasma membrane could also permit distin - guishing exosomes from plasma membrane - derived EVs , provided that they are unique to exosome secretion . Rab GTPases . Members of the Rab family of small GTPases play well - established roles in transferring vesicles between intracel - lular compartments 49 and have also been implicated in MVB trafficking to the plasma membrane for exosome release 50 , 51 . For example , impairing Rab27a or Rab27b altered MVB morphology and docking to the plasma membrane 50 , indicating a role in exo - some secretion . Although neither this nor subsequent studies 52 , 53 evaluated the effects of manipulating Rab27a / b on the secretion of other EVs , Rab27a inhibition was separately shown to decrease HIV secretion from the plasma membrane in an MVB - dependent manner 54 ( Fig . 2 ) . Whether this observation also applies to non - virus - induced plasma membrane - derived EVs is unknown , but it is worth considering when interpreting EV - related effects of Rab27 inhibition . Beyond MVBs , Rab27a / b are involved in the secretion of Weibel – Palade bodies and Golgi - derived secretory granules 55 , 56 . Thus , Rab27a / b inhibition could affect the secretion of soluble com - ponents present inside such granules , as observed for some soluble non - EV - associated proteins in Rab27a - depleted tumour cells 57 , 58 . Thus , using Rab27a / b inhibition to prove exosome or small EV involvement requires further steps , such as rescuing the phenotype by exogenous exosomes or small EVs . The same considerations apply to other small GTPases that promote exosome or small EV secretion . For instance , inhibiting Rab11a 59 , 60 , Rab35 ( refs . 51 , 61 ) or Rab7 ( ref . 42 ) resulted in decreased small EV recovery . However , Rab11 and Rab35 function in early or recycling endosomes , raising the possibility that the released vesicles originate from earlier endosomes or even from the plasma membrane ( Fig . 2 ) . Interestingly , in cytotoxic T lymphocytes 62 , fusion between late Rab27a + and recycling Rab11a + endosomes is mediated by the Rab27a effector Munc13 - 4 ( encoded by UNC13D ) and is required for regulated fusion of cytotoxic granules with the plasma membrane . Similarly , Rab11a and Rab27a crosstalk could be involved in the recently described Ca 2 + - induced Rab11a – Munc13 - 4 - dependent secretion of exosomes in a human cancer cell line 60 . Together , these studies indicate that the cell type , environment and analysis of EV secretion at steady state or upon induction ( for example , by Ca 2 + level increase or other means ) may influ - ence the mechanism of small EV and / or exosome secretion so that a specific experimental condition may not be valid in other experi - mental systems . SNAREs . Rab GTPases may be acting at too early or promiscuous intracellular trafficking steps to be used for modulation of exo - some secretion . Thus , a main goal of studying exosome biogen - esis is to identify the SNARE ( soluble N - ethylmaleimide - sensitive fusion attachment protein receptor ) complexes that are specifically required for MVB fusion with the plasma membrane . The YKT6 SNARE was shown to be required for the secretion of Wnt - bearing exosomes 63 , and Syx - 5 , the C . elegans homologue of syntaxin - 5 , was reported to target MVBs to the plasma membrane through the Ral - 1 small GTPase 64 . However , given that both of these SNAREs are involved in endoplasmic reticulum - to - Golgi trafficking , their inhibition is bound to also affect regular secretion pathways . Separately , syntaxin - 1A , a neuron - specific SNARE involved in synaptic vesicle secretion , was found to affect exosome secretion in Drosophila 65 . In HeLa cells , a plasma membrane - associated SNARE , synaptosomal - associated protein 23 ( SNAP - 23 ) , mediates MVB – plasma membrane fusion spontaneously and following histamine treatment 66 . Although these SNAREs are involved in fusion events closer to the plasma membrane and therefore may not interfere with upstream trafficking , they may also be involved in secretion from secretory granules . Visualizing MVB trafficking and EV release at the cellular level could also permit distinguishing between secretory versus degrada - tion pathways . For example , using a pH - sensitive fluorescent CD63 construct in combination with correlative light - electron micros - copy permitted the unequivocal visualization and quantification of MVB fusion with the plasma membrane 66 . However , the respective contribution of this pathway versus direct plasma membrane bud - ding or fusion of less acidic compartments could not be determined because the latter events are not quantifiable by this type of pH - sensitive experimental system . Cytoskeleton . Budding and the release of EVs require altered actin polymerization under the plasma membrane followed by contrac - tion of the actomyosin cytoskeleton 67 , 68 in a process orchestrated by the small GTPase RhoA . However , the status of the actin pool around MVBs and its possible effect on ILV formation have not been explored . Depolymerization of cortical actin is also probably necessary to allow docking of MVBs to the plasma membrane for subsequent exosome release . Thus , targeting actin polymerization may indirectly promote exosome secretion . Similarly , the microtubule network is probably required for the transport of MVBs to the plasma membrane 69 ; however , although its pharmacological inhibition decreases exosome secretion 70 , it also affects other plasma membrane - derived domains , such as cilia or nanotubes . Thus , although cytoskeletal components may play important roles in the secretion of exosomes versus plasma mem - brane - derived EVs , targeting them is also likely to induce diverse non - specific effects . enveloped viruses versus exosomes and other small eVs Enveloped virus budding shares many similarities with small EV biogenesis . Viruses use the host intracellular trafficking machinery during the different steps of virion assembly and budding , which , as for EVs , may occur in different locations depending on the virus and host cell . In the case of HIV - 1 , virus assembly occurs at the plasma membrane of T cells 71 , whereas in macrophages , it takes place in internal compartments 72 . Recruitment of the HIV - 1 Gag protein at the membrane budding site is necessary for the final assembly of the viral components 71 . Gag also recruits the ESCRT machinery , including TSG101 ( refs . 73 , 74 ) and ALIX 75 , that eventu - ally mediates the release of the nascent particle through a mem - brane fission event 76 ( Fig . 2 ) . The nucleocapside domain of Gag can mimic the PDZ domains of syntenin to capture ALIX , such that syntenin can replace nucleocapside function during HIV - 1 bud - ding 77 . In contrast to large EVs and syntenin - containing exosomes PersPective | FOCUS https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41556 - 018 - 0250 - 9 PersPective | FOCUS NaTure Cell Biology NaTure CeLL BioLoGy | VOL 21 | JANUARY 2019 | 9 – 17 | www . nature . com / naturecellbiology 12 FOCUS | PersPective NaTure Cell Biology ( see previous section ) , HIV - 1 budding occurs independently of the ARF6 GTPase 44 , but it also involves many Rab proteins , including Rab9 , Rab7a , Rab27a , Rab14 and Rab11 - FIP1C ( reviewed in ref . 78 ) , that are also known to promote EV secretion 42 , 50 . The exception is Rab14 , the potential roles in EV regulation of which remain to be investigated . SNAREs are also involved in both HIV and EV release . Inhibition of the SNARE machinery demonstrated its role in Gag protein localization at the plasma membrane and , consequently , in HIV - 1 assembly 79 ; however , whether some SNAREs are specific to EVs without affecting HIV is undetermined . Finally , HIV - 1 assem - bly involves the formation of filamentous actin structures that disap - pear after virus budding 80 . Although actin - disrupting drugs reduce viral production 80 , 81 , they might also affect EV release as noted ear - lier . As many aspects of these processes are still largely unknown , it will be necessary to identify and characterize individual molecules that regulate specific steps of EV and virus production . At ~ 120 nm , the diameter of HIV - 1 is comparable to that of exo - somes and small EVs . These membrane - enclosed structures also share other physical and molecular features . For example , the lipid composition of both HIV - 1 virions and small EVs includes high proportions of cholesterol , sphingomyelin and saturated lipids 82 , 83 , and both possess the same membrane orientation . HIV - 1 virion membranes are also enriched for the CD63 ( ref . 84 ) and CD81 ( ref . 85 ) tetraspanins that are found on small EVs . Such similarities make the separation of virions and EVs from virus - infected cells particu - larly challenging ( Fig . 1 ) . For example , small EVs and HIV - 1 virions achieve the same equilibrium densities in sucrose density gradi - ents 86 . Further complicating matters , virus - infected cells produce modified EVs that incorporate fragments of the viral genome and viral proteins , meaning that classical purification techniques result in the co - purification of these elements 87 . Thus , the study of small EV function during HIV - 1 infection has been hampered by the dif - ficulty in obtaining HIV - free EV preparations , which could explain contradictory reports regarding the induction of both proviral and antiviral EV responses 87 . Biology of eV uptake and examples of resulting functions The rising interest in EVs is linked to their capacity to trigger phe - notypic changes in acceptor cells . Differences in EV size and / or sur - face components probably influence their recognition and capture by target cells . For instance , micropinocytosis is in theory compat - ible with the capture of isolated exosomes and small EVs , but not large EVs or small EV aggregates , which are too large 88 . As we are only starting to appreciate EV diversity , our knowledge of the fate of different subtypes once they reach acceptor cells remains limited . Thus , in this section , we discuss general EV uptake mechanisms and associated functions . EVs can transmit information to acceptor cells by acting at the cell surface , without delivery of their content . For instance , during immune responses , EVs harbouring major histocompatibility com - plex – peptide complexes can activate cognate T cell receptors on T lymphocytes 7 , 89 . EVs can also be internalized and either targeted to the lysosome for degradation or recycled and released in the extra - cellular space . This type of EV recycling within acceptor breast cancer cells enables the association of Wnt11 with internalized fibroblast - derived CD81 + EVs 90 . Re - release of these particles was shown to trigger breast cancer cell motility through Wnt - related signalling 90 . However , the main characteristic of EVs is to enclose and trans - mit molecules protected by a lipid bilayer . Many studies report the effects of full delivery of EV cargo . This is illustrated hereafter through selected examples . Several reports demonstrate EV roles in tumour progression , for instance , through the exchange of RNAs between glioblastoma and endothelial cells 11 , oncogenic DNA sequences and retrotransposon elements between medulloblastoma and endothelial cells 91 , and proteins , such as the oncogenic epidermal growth factor receptor variant III ( EGFRvIII ) receptor , between glioma cells 92 . The transfer of proteins has also been reported in the nervous system , where the EV - mediated transfer of cytosolic syn - aptotagmin 4 from presynaptic to postsynaptic cells allows retro - grade control of presynaptic activity 93 . In a different context , toxic components , such as the scrapie form of the prion PrPsc , are loaded into EVs to be disseminated into normal cells 94 , 95 . In addition , the chemokine receptor CCR5 , which is required for transmission and propagation of HIV - 1 , can be exchanged between monocytes and endothelial cells via EVs , leading to the infection of tissues that are normally not equipped with the machinery required for viral infection 96 . The mechanisms of EV uptake and cargo delivery into the cyto - sol of acceptor cells are still incompletely characterized ( Fig . 3 ) . The first step of EV uptake involves targeting the acceptor cell . However , whether the particular combination of EV subtype and acceptor cell confers targeting specificity or whether the process is unspecific and stochastic remains unresolved , with literature providing support for both possibilities . For instance , small EVs emanating from oligo - dendrocytes are internalized preferentially by microglia , rather than neurons 97 . Small EVs from primary neurons are only captured by other neurons , whereas those from a neuroblastoma cell line bind equally to astrocytes 98 . By contrast , HeLa cells are able to take up a wide variety of EVs produced by different cells 99 , 100 and this seems to be the case for various cell types , as shown in experiments in which EVs were broadly labelled with generic lipophilic dyes or fluorescent CD63 ( ref . 101 ) . Providing further support for a generic targeting process , EV - mediated cargo transfer can occur in an interspecies , mouse and human , context 9 . Nevertheless , physiologically relevant specific targeting might be achieved through a combination of EV and cell type that remains to be elucidated . CD47 , an integrin - asso - ciated protein that protects cells from phagocytosis , is often found on the surface of EVs and was shown to increase the time of EV circulation in the blood by preventing their phagocytosis by mac - rophage and monocytes 102 . This resulted in more efficient target - ing of these EVs to pancreatic cells to deliver an artificially loaded short interfering RNA 102 , suggesting that cell targeting could also be achieved through a negative - selection mechanism . Identifying the physiological targets of EVs and how these may differ for particu - lar EV subtypes will provide a tremendous advantage in selecting experimental models and developing new assays . The second step of uptake is the entry point into the acceptor cell . Although most studies report internalization of EVs by accep - tor cells , whether this occurs through a non - specific process such as macropinocytosis or micropinocytosis , or through a specific , recep - tor - dependent pathway is unclear 88 . Many proteins localized on the surface of EVs and acceptor cells , including integrins 103 – 105 , lectins / proteoglycans 106 and T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain - containing protein 4 ( Tim4 ) 107 , have been proposed to be involved in EV uptake and , therefore , they could also contribute to cell tar - geting specificity . However , none has been established as a bona fide EV receptor by showing that it is sufficient and necessary for EV internalization . Many EV subtypes share common surface pro - teins and it is possible that one of them acts as a general ligand for a receptor , enabling vesicle internalization , similarly to the uptake mechanism of low - density lipoprotein 108 . Thus far , EV internalization has been reported to occur through multiple routes that involve endocytosis by both clathrin - dependent and clathrin - independent pathways 88 , 99 – 101 . This aspect of EV func - tion also lacks consensus . For instance , caveolin 1 , which is involved in a form of clathrin - independent endocytosis , has been proposed to have both negative and positive effects in EV uptake in experi - mental setups that were relatively similar 99 , 100 , 109 . The uptake route might be more dependent on the acceptor cell type than on the EVs themselves , as in most studies , EVs are broadly tracked through the use of generic lipophilic dyes .

Many studies do not assess the end point of EV internalization ( for example , content delivery versus EV deg - radation or re - secretion ) , which prevents conclusions regard - ing the functional consequences on EV - mediated cargo transfer . Nevertheless , the plasma membrane has been proposed as a target membrane for the delivery of content through membrane fusion 110 . This may be the case for plasma membrane - derived EVs that are capable of delivering DNA 111 , because their larger size might limit their internalization . Although this mechanism cannot be formally ruled out , most publications report EV entry into cells through internalization , before cargo delivery . Thus , the endosome is the putative location of EV - content delivery , and membrane fusion in response to acidic pH has been proposed as a possible mecha - nism 110 , 112 , similarly to the process used by some viruses 113 . Lipids , such as cholesterol and phosphatidylserine , might also play a role in membrane fusion . For example , annexin V , which binds to phospha - tidylserine exposed at the surface of certain EVs , has been reported to block the fusion between monocyte - derived EVs and activated platelets 114 . However , many EVs do not harbour phosphatidylserine at their surface 115 , suggesting the involvement of other molecules . EV topology indicates that their fusion with plasma or endosome membranes would require a specific machinery that would differ from the SNARE proteins used for fusion between intracellular ves - icles ( Fig . 3 ) . Other mechanisms that may control EV escape from endosomes , for example , by releasing partially degraded material from ruptured endosomal or lysosomal compartments , cannot be ruled out . Furthermore , some unexpected delivery mechanisms have been described , including direct transfer into the nucleus 116 or the endoplasmic reticulum 117 through the contact of these compart - ments with endosomes that contain internalized EVs . These obser - vations await further investigation , but raise intriguing possibilities about EV - specific intracellular fates . Conclusions A major advance of the past decade is the increased recognition that EVs include many different particle subtypes , each of which may have interesting functions in cell - to - cell communication . The heightened interest in this field notwithstanding , our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that govern EV biogen - esis , release , uptake and function remains limited . A key limitation for the precise characterization of EVs has been the technical dif - ficulty in isolating and characterizing pure populations of specific subtypes , as the methods currently at our disposal lead to the sys - tematic co - isolation of EVs of distinct subcellular origins . Thus , although many articles use the term ‘exosome’ to refer to EV prepa - rations that have been separated from larger EVs by physical pro - cesses , it is likely that they rather refer to a mixture of small EVs of both exosomal and non - exosomal nature . Hence , unless their MVB origin has been clearly established , it may be preferable to favour the generic term ‘small EVs’ 118 . Our current knowledge of EV physiology , diversity , internaliza - tion and cargo delivery is still too limited to yield clear mechanis - tic conclusions about precisely how EVs interact with and modify acceptor cells . For the EV field to progress , it will be necessary to perform studies in a comprehensive manner that includes EV subtypes ( 1 ) Targeting ( 2 ) Entry Docking Indirect Direct ( 3 ' ) Delivery Signalling ( 3 ) Delivery Recycling Degradation Protein Protein Protein Protein Sugar Lipid Lipid Lipid Virus VSVG Endosome Endolysosome SNARE SNAREs ? ? H + Fig . 3 | The three steps of eV uptake by acceptor cells . ( 1 ) EVs or a specific EV subtype are targeted to the acceptor cell . Docking could occur through specific molecular interactions involving membrane - exposed proteins , sugars or lipids ( inset ) , or through unspecific macropinocytosis or micropinocytosis . ( 2 ) EVs that enter the acceptor cell may be targeted to endosomes . ( 3 ) Internalized EVs release their content through the indirect route of endosomal escape . This might involve membrane fusion through unknown molecular mechanisms , which could resemble those used by viruses harbouring the fusogenic protein VSVG . The eukaryotic fusogenic proteins SNAREs , which mediate fusions of intracellular compartments by connecting the respective cytosolic sides of their membranes , cannot play a role in EV - to - acceptor cell fusion , as the cytosolic sides of these two membranes are in opposite orientations . Once internalized , EVs might also be recycled and re - secreted or targeted to the lysosome for degradation . ( 3 ′ ) An alternative , direct route of content delivery to the acceptor cell could involve EV fusion with the plasma membrane and cargo release directly into the cytosol .

Such approaches will be crucial to determine which of the identified molecules or mechanisms are specific to certain EV subtypes versus those that are instead applicable to all EVs . A specific area that would benefit from further investigation is EV uptake . There is currently no consensus regarding the main route followed by EVs or a given EV subtype to deliver content in the cytosol of acceptor cells . Determining whether internaliza - tion occurs through macropinocytosis or micropinocytosis and / or receptor - mediated pathways , and whether these processes result in cargo delivery will be essential to understand and control EV uptake . A suitable approach may be to first track a generic soluble cargo present in many different EV types to determine the condi - tions ( including donor and acceptor cell combinations ) under which cargo exchange has notable physiological and biochemical effects . This knowledge would then permit characterization of the cellular and molecular underpinnings of EV uptake and content delivery . It will also be important to consider how the various bio - genesis , release and uptake pathways affect intracellular functions not related to EVs . Such systematic analyses will facilitate the iden - tification of specific EV functions in physiological and pathological settings , and will aid in translating this knowledge for the treat - ment of pathological effects of EVs or the therapeutic application of EV - relevant cellular mechanisms .
