Montague Cobb - NMA Health Institute 2022 Abstract Background COVID - 19 revealed and broadened existing disparities in large cities . This article interprets the early impacts of COVID - 19 on food insecurity ( FI ) in the Chicago and New York City ( NYC ) metropolitan areas for Black , Indigenous , and People of Color ( BIPOC ) and provides a study using a Social Determinants of Health ( SDOH ) framework . Methods A cross - sectional survey adapted from the National Food Access and COVID Research Team ( NFACT ) was deployed in Chicago ( N = 680 ) and in NYC ( N = 525 ) during summer 2020 and oversampled for race , ethnicity , and socio - economic status . Multivariate binary logistic regression generated adjusted odds ratios ( aOR ) and 95 % CIs for FI and select SDOH variables , which was conducted on each dataset . Results The prevalence of FI in NYC increased to 66 . 8 % ( from 57 . 8 % ) and in Chicago to 44 . 8 % ( from 41 . 0 % ) . While higher income protected against FI before , protection was diminished or eliminated since COVID - 19 . FI declined for households with children in NYC while odds increased and became significant in Chicago . Respondents with chronic health conditions experienced increased odds of FI since COVID . In Chicago , this variable had the highest odds of FI . Respondents with depression or anxiety had increased odds of FI . In NYC , depression had the highest odds of FI . Females in NYC were pro - tected against FI . Hispanics in NYC lost protection against FI from before to since COVID - 19 . Conclusions Results support the observed rise of FI for BIPOC and its association with health status . The analysis has multifaceted , structural policy implications for reducing FI in urban centers . Keywords Food insecurity · COVID - 19 · Chicago · New York City · Racial / ethnic disparities · Social determinants of health Introduction In public health , social inequities are examined across communi - ties to understand the interlinkages between social structures and human well - being . Among diverse methods to better understand differential effects of the COVID - 19 pandemic across commu - nities , indices provide an assessment of household well - being useful in analyses [ 1 ] . Subsequent measures of health inequi - ties during COVID - 19 include access to quality healthcare , education , and food security [ 2 – 4 ] . In times of crisis such as the ongoing COVID - 19 pandemic , pre - existing social inequalities lead to increased risks of infections , disease , disability , and mor - tality , especially among those of lower socioeconomic status . Even before COVID - 19 , historically marginalized communi - ties experienced higher levels of unemployment , poor general health , poor nutritional status , and underlying chronic health conditions , such as diabetes mellitus and heart disease [ 5 ] . * John Mazzeo jmazzeo @ depaul . edu Preety Gadhoke drgadhoke @ gmail . com 1 Master of Public Health Program , College of Liberal Arts and Social Sciences , DePaul University , 1 E .

Debates around measuring and tracking inequity include alternatives that draw on SDOH for meas - uring inequity outside of strictly income - based variables . Examining inequality beyond income paints a more accurate picture of social inequality and , conversely , well - being [ 7 ] . As such , food security is a core SDOH [ 6 ] . Food inse - curity ( FI ) is defined as having limited or no access to suf - ficient , nutritious food for living an active , healthy life . FI disproportionately impacts low - income communities and Black , Indigenous , and People of Color ( BIPOC ) [ 8 ] and is associated with poor health outcomes [ 9 ] . The United States Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) Six - Item Household Food Security Module offers a validated index to measure FI that we used to test hypotheses about the impacts of COVID - 19 on BIPOC households across multiple sites [ 10 ] . The COVID - 19 pandemic has revealed and broadened frac - tures in social structures , widening disparities globally across spheres of food security , health , and income . Pandemics affect humanity along the “fault lines of society—exposing and often magnifying power inequities that shape population health even in [ less uncertain ] times” [ 11 , 12 ] . COVID - 19 has resulted in the worsening of FI , which exacerbates worry and distress about not being able to meet basic household needs [ 13 ] . This chasm became severe for BIPOC in the USA—those who were already experiencing greater FI before the pandemic [ 8 ] and were sicker and living shorter lives than Whites [ 14 – 17 ] . These disparities of COVID - 19 morbidity and mortality are “unjust , avoidable and… preventable” [ 16 , 18 ] . COVID - 19 is associated with greater FI among BIPOC and worse mental health outcomes [ 19 – 21 ] . Moreover , the US Cen - sus Bureau’s Household Pulse Survey reported that , although economic activity resumed in the USA around May 2020 , the pandemic and subsequent social distancing restrictions led to family hardship , particularly food scarcity [ 22 ] . As a result , many individuals turned to safety net programs in their locali - ties for help early in the pandemic , including food pantries and social assistance programs ( i . e . , Supplemental Nutrition Assis - tance Program ( SNAP ) , Medicaid , and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families ( TANF ) ) , the $ 2 . 0 trillion Coronavirus Aid , Relief , and Economic Security ( CARES ) Act , and a more exten - sive relief package by the Trump administration [ 23 ] . While it is important to understand the breadth and depth of the impact of COVID - 19 for building future resilience to public health crises [ 24 , 25 ] , few studies have reported empirical evidence about the impact of COVID - 19 on FI in the USA [ 9 , 26 ] . In addition to the inability to provide nutritious , affordable , available , and acceptable foods for a household , FI is associated with multiple adverse health outcomes , such as diabetes mellitus , hypertension , cardio - vascular disease , depression , and increased risk of mortality [ 26 ] . With the continued threat of the COVID - 19 pandemic , worsening economic conditions and financial instability adversely impact FI households [ 27 ] and BIPOC [ 9 , 28 ] . Large metropolitan areas have great variability in terms of policies that can influence FI and health outcomes for residents . Two of the largest cities in the USA—Chicago and New York City ( NYC ) —have different welfare - oriented policies in place that may influence differences in FI outcomes . For example , pre - COVID - 19 , NYC’s safety net structure was heavily reliant on human services nonprofit organizations that , since the pan - demic , have experienced large budget decreases from a lack of government funding [ 29 ] . Meanwhile , Chicago’s pre - COVID - 19 support is reliant on federal and state welfare programs , such as SNAP and the Healthy Hunger - Free Kids Act of 2010 ( imple - mented in Chicago Public Schools [ CPS ] ) , all of which received continuous support during the pandemic . The city of Chicago also partnered with community nonprofit organizations for food distribution , and although resources were available , social dis - tancing and business closures made it difficult to access [ 30 ] . Leveraging the SDOH framework [ 6 ] in combination with the safety net response to COVID - 19 , our study examines FI in Chicago and in NYC [ 23 , 31 – 35 ] . The aims of this paper are to ( 1 ) report and interpret the impacts of COVID - 19 on BIPOC FI households in the greater Chicago and NYC metropolitan areas and ( 2 ) discuss how these findings reflect differing urban contexts and safety net policies for the pur - pose of narrowing and eliminating disparities in FI . Methodology Study Design Our exploratory study began early in the pandemic . We recognized the need to collect data quickly to identify the early impacts of COVID - 19 on FI for BIPOC across geog - raphies and populations . As such , our study contributes to the efforts of a larger national collaborative , known as the National Food Access and COVID Research Team ( NFACT ) . This group developed a survey to evaluate the early and ongoing impacts of COVID - 19 on food security . That survey relies on the USDA Six - Item Food Security Module to generate a comparable measure of FI [ 10 ] . As of August 2020 , the NFACT survey was administered across 18 sites and 15 states , including a national poll [ 19 ] . The Chicago and NYC studies adapted the NFACT survey to fit our respective contexts . The research team applied the SDOH Framework , with new measures on access to healthcare and mental health , among others [ 36 – 38 ] , from a previously 1705 Journal of Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities ( 2023 ) 10 : 1703 – 1720 1 3 validated survey [ 26 ] . Our adaptations included shortening the survey administration time by streamlining the language and eliminating most comment fields , and adding health measures such as access to health care , mental health status , physical health status , and high risk medical conditions for COVID - 19 . Our analysis examined datasets for Chicago and NYC separately . Both were collected using a similar survey and methodology . We did not merge the data or attempt to draw statistical comparisons between the cities . The Chicago sur - vey covered the Chicago Metropolitan Statistical Area ( Cook , DeKalb , DuPage , Grundy , Kane , Kankakee , Kendall , Lake , McHenry , and Will Counties in Illinois ; and Lake , Newton , and Porter Counties in Indiana ) . The NYC survey included NYC proper ( Manhattan County [ NYC ] , Kings County [ Brooklyn ] , Queens County [ Queens ] , Richmond County [ Staten Island ] , and Bronx County [ Bronx ] ) and surround - ing Hudson and Westchester Counties in New York , Bergen County in New Jersey , and Fairfield County in Connecticut . We used a nested quota sampling design to meet specific targets for race , ethnicity , income , and education . Estimating outcomes for BIPOC in public health research is crucial and oversampling is a way to deliver more accurate estimates than what can be obtained from comparisons to the general popu - lation [ 39 ] . We oversampled in both cities using a similar design to capture self - reported low - income populations ( less than $ 25 , 000 annual income before 2019 taxes ) ( 50 % Chi - cago , 50 % NYC ) , Black ( 50 % Chicago , 40 % NYC ) , Native American ( 10 % NYC ) , Hispanic ( 50 % Chicago , 40 % NYC ) , and those with a high school education or less ( 50 % Chi - cago , 50 % NYC ) . It is important to note that in our recently published NFACT multisite paper , three other studies also oversampled for BIPOC populations [ 19 ] . Both surveys used a cross - sectional design and were conducted independently at a single data collection time point during the summer of 2020 . Respondents were asked about perceived differences in their state of living across two different time periods . Specifically , we asked partici - pants to make a self - assessment of their state before COVID - 19 versus their current state in real time since COVID - 19 . All “before CO13D - 19” data were retrospective recalls by respondents at the same time they responded to items about “since COVID - 19 . ” The start of the coronavirus outbreak was defined as March 2020 . Responses to “before COVID - 19” included the 12 months prior to March 2020 , while “since COVID - 19” included everything after the March 2020 onset of COVID - 19 to the time of the survey . Participants were recruited from a web - based consumer panel and screened based on age ( 18 and over ) , race , ethnicity , county of residence , income , and education levels [ 36 ] . Respond - ents were asked to provide information about their household which included all individuals who lived with them . Only one respondent per household participated . The consumer panel solicited participation from registered members and provided compensation for participation . Subsample quotas were achieved by targeting solicitations to members who met the demographic and socioeconomic criteria . Final de - identified datasets were delivered to the research team . Variables Food Security We utilized the United States Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) Six - Item validated Food Security Module to measure FI ( out - come ) before COVID - 19 and since COVID - 19 . The Six - Item Short Form [ 10 ] was adapted to ask about the time period both “in the year before the coronavirus outbreak” and “since the coro - navirus outbreak , ” defined in the survey instrument as “before COVID - 19” and “since COVID - 19 , ” respectively ( Appendix 17 ) . Scoring and classification used established procedures from the USDA Food Security Module ( Appendix 17 ) . According to the USDA , for reporting purposes a raw score of 0 – 1 is described as “food secure , ” and the two categories “low food security” ( 2 – 4 ) and “very low food security” ( 5 – 6 ) in combination are referred to as FI [ 10 ] . The measure was used without modifications in the univariate analysis and represented as three categories : “food secure” ( 0 – 1 ) , “low food security” ( 2 – 4 ) , and “very low food security” ( 5 – 6 ) . In the bivariate and multivariate analyses , food security was re - coded as a binary categorical variable where 0 corresponds to “food secure” and 1 corresponds to “FI . ” Household Determinants This category has two variables : household income and household with children . Household income captures all income streams for the household to which the respondent belongs . Household income was categorized into seven sub - categories , where 0 corresponds to “Less than $ 12 , 000 per year” and 6 corresponds to “ $ 125 , 000 or greater per year . ” Respondents were asked to report the number of persons less than 18 years old living in their households . This vari - able was re - coded into a binary categorical variable where 0 corresponds to “No children living in the household” and 1 corresponds to “Children are living in the household . ” Individual Determinants This category represents the respondent’s physical and mental health , in addition to their access to healthcare services . Respondents self - reported the presence of a health condition or multiple health condi - tions , including cancer , hypertension , diabetes , chronic respiratory disease , rheumatological disease , and cardiovascular disease . This variable was re - coded into a binary categorical variable , where 0 corresponds to “No health condition” and 1 corresponds to “Health condition present . ” These specific chronic health conditions are a health burden , physically , mentally , and economically . These health 1706 Journal of Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities ( 2023 ) 10 : 1703 – 1720 1 3 conditions place individuals at a greater risk for developing serious illness when contracting COVID - 19 [ 40 ] . Anxiety and depression were measured using the GAD - 2 [ 41 ] and PHQ - 2 [ 42 ] scales , respectively . Both screening tests use a score scale from 0 to 6 . If a respondent’s score is higher than 3 ( optimal cut point ) , the test is considered positive ( posi - tive GAD - 2 and / or PHQ - 2 ) and the respondent is at higher risk of having either anxiety or depression , respectively . Accord - ingly , these variables were coded as 0 which corresponds to “Negative” and 1 which corresponds to “Positive . ” Health insurance status was categorized into three sub - categories , where 0 corresponds to “Private health insur - ance , ” 1 corresponds to “Public health insurance , ” and 2 corresponds to “No health insurance . ” This category of variables also represents the respondents’ self - identified demographics and educational attainment . Par - ticipants’ demographics consist of age , gender , race , and ethnic - ity . Age was categorized into three groups where 0 corresponds to ages “18 to 39 , ” 1 corresponds to ages “40 to 55 , ” and 2 corresponds to “56 years old and above . ” Gender had five categories : “Female , ” “Male , ” Non - binary , ” “Transgender , ” and “Other . ” The gender variable was re - coded to a binary categorical variable where 0 corresponds to “Male” and 1 corresponds to “Female” in the bivariate and multivariate analyses . Other subcategories of gender were omitted from these analyses due to very low statistical power . Race and ethnicity were re - coded into two categories . The first cat - egory has two subcategories , where 0 corresponds to “Non - Hispanic White” and 1 corresponds to “Black , Indigenous , People Of Color ( BIPOC ) . ” The second category has two subcategories , where 0 cor - responds to “non - Hispanic” and 1 corresponds to “Hispanic . ” Respondents’ education was re - coded into three catego - ries based on the level of their educational attainment in the statistical analyses . Respondents who received education after bachelor’s level were coded as 0 . Those who attained education in a college ( some college education , or associate degree ) or a university degree ( bachelor degree ) were coded as 1 . Finally , respondents who obtained education up to a high school level were coded as 2 . Statistical Analysis Descriptive analysis was conducted to explore the frequencies of the USDA Six - Item validated Food Security Module . The inde - pendent variables were treated as categorical variables ( nominal or ordinal ) and examined using frequencies . The mode was calcu - lated as a measure of central tendency and dispersion . A McNe - mar’s test was conducted to assess the statistically significant change in the proportions of food security status before COVID - 19 and since COVID - 19 . Only respondents who answered all USDA Six - Item questions for before and since COVID - 19 were included in the test ( matched pairs pre - post test ) . Bivariate chi - square tests were conducted to examine the differences in FI prevalence when stratified by the indicator variables . To consider the results of the McNemar’s or chi - square tests to be statistically significant , the p - value must be less than 0 . 05 . The multivariate binary logistic regression model was devel - oped using the SDOH framework . Our model includes vari - ables for four of the five social - economic indicator categories : ( 1 ) economic stability : household income range ; ( 2 ) access to quality education : education level ; ( 3 ) access to quality health - care : presence of a health condition , anxiety screen , depression screen , and health insurance status ; and ( 4 ) social and com - munity context : children in the household , age , gender , race , and ethnicity . We did not analyze variables for the neighbor - hood and built environment SDOH category [ 6 ] . The multi - variate logistic regression model was applied to examine the associations between FI and all of the independent variables at the same time . The multivariate regression models’ results were reported as adjusted odds ratios . The confidence intervals ( CI ) were set at 95 % which corresponds to a p - value of 5 % . To consider an association significant , the reported ratios must have had a p - value < 0 . 05 . The area under the receiver operating characteristic ( ROC ) curve was calculated to evaluate how well the adjusted binary logistic regression models classify positive and negative food security status outcomes at all possible cutoff points . The analysis was performed with Stata / BE 17 . 0 . Results Descriptives The characteristics and demographics of individual respondents and households are shown in Table 1 . The descriptives relevant to the sampling design include income , race , ethnicity , and edu - cation . A similar percentage of households reported an annual income of less than $ 25 , 000 in Chicago and NYC ( 31 . 4 % and 34 . 7 % , respectively ) . Most respondents were 18 to 39 years old in Chicago and NYC ( 70 % , 69 . 5 % , respectively ) . The gender of respondents in Chicago was 46 . 2 % female and 52 . 1 % male , 0 . 9 % non - binary , 0 . 7 % transgender , and 0 . 1 % other . In NYC , 52 . 6 % of respondents were female , 45 . 5 % male , 0 . 8 % non - binary , 0 . 9 % transgender , and 0 . 2 % other . Most respondents in Chicago and NYC identified as BIPOC ( 74 . 4 % and 92 % respectively ) . Both Chicago and NYC had a similar percentage of respondents who identified as Hispanic ( 36 . 6 % and 36 . 2 % respectively ) . Respond - ents who have reported having up to a high school education in Chicago and NYC were 29 . 1 % and 29 . 7 % respectively . Descriptives relevant to SDOH include the presence of children in the household , presence of a health condition , anxiety , depression , and health insurance status . In Chi - cago , 55 . 7 % of respondents reported having children living in their household , and in NYC it was 60 . 4 % . Respondents who reported a health condition were 32 . 9 % in Chicago , and 51 . 2 % in NYC . Most Chicago respondents screened positive 1707 Journal of Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities ( 2023 ) 10 : 1703 – 1720 1 3 for anxiety and depression ( 66 . 6 % and 66 . 7 % , respectively ) , while positive screens for anxiety and depression in NYC were 37 . 9 % and 43 . 8 % , respectively . A similar percentage of respondents reported having a type of health insurance in Chicago and NYC ( 85 . 7 % and 86 . 7 % respectively ) . Food security assessments before and since COVID - 19 in Chicago and NYC are shown in Table 2 . Since COVID - 19 , the percentage of households classified as food secure ( score 0 – 1 ) declined and FI households ( score 2 – 6 ) increased in both cities . In Chicago , 44 . 8 % of households were FI since Table 1 Descriptive characteristics † Black , Indigenous , and People Of Color and reference is non - Hispanic White Indicator Chicago ( n = 680 ) NYC ( n = 525 ) Household income range , 2019—no .

In NYC , the percentage of FI households since COVID - 19 was 66 . 8 % , compared to 57 . 8 % before . A greater percentage of households in Chicago and NYC reported very low food security since COVID - 19 ( 20 . 6 % and 28 . 7 % , respectively ) compared to before ( 14 . 6 % and 22 . 7 % , respectively ) . Bivariate Analyses Table 3 shows the food security status ( food secure vs FI ) of matched - pairs ( before COVID - 19 and since COVID - 19 ) respondents in Chicago and NYC . We classified FI households that completed all Food Security Index questions for before and since COVID - 19 into consistently FI ( CFI ) and newly FI ( NFI ) categories . Households that were FI before and since COVID - 19 were categorized as CFI . Households were categorized as NFI when they were food secure before and FI since COVID - 19 [ 26 ] . NFI is significant because it demonstrates the loss of food secu - rity since COVID - 19 . In Chicago , the number of CFI households was 200 ( 80 % ) and that of NFI households was 50 ( 20 % ) . Simi - larly , in NYC , the number of CFI households was 272 ( 79 . 5 % ) and that of NFI households was 70 ( 20 . 5 % ) . Table 4 shows the FI status of respondents ( matched - pairs ) in Chicago and NYC before and since COVID - 19 . In Chi - cago , the difference in proportions of FI was 3 . 99 % higher ( p < 0 . 05 , 95 % CI : 0 . 01 – 0 . 07 ) since COVID - 19 compared to before COVID - 19 . Likewise in NYC , the difference in propor - tions of FI was higher ( p < 0 . 001 , 95 % CI : 0 . 05 – 0 . 13 ) since COVID - 19 when compared with before COVID - 19 . Chi - square analyses were conducted to test if there were differ - ences in prevalence of FI when stratified by the indicators before and since COVID - 19 in Chicago and NYC . There was a signifi - cant difference in the prevalence of FI between the subcategories of household income , anxiety and depression screens , health insurance , age , race , and education in Chicago before COVID - 19 ( Appendix 6 ) . After COVID - 19 , FI prevalence remained signifi - cantly different across the previous variables in addition to children in a household and ethnicity ( Appendix 7 ) . In NYC , there was a significant difference in the prevalence of FI across children in a household , health condition , anxiety , depression , health insurance , age , gender , race , and ethnicity before COVID - 19 ( Appendix 8 ) . Since COVID - 19 , FI prevalence remained significant for the pre - vious variables except for age , race , and ethnicity ( Appendix 9 ) . Multivariate Logistic Regression Before COVID‑19 Table 5 shows the multivariate binary logistic regression analyses before and since COVID - 19 in Chicago and NYC . In Chicago , the adjusted model showed that the association of income was signifi - cant across almost all subcategories . When controlling for all covari - ates , the higher the income subcategory , the lower the odds to have reported FI . As such , income subcategory $ 125 , 000 or above had the least odds of reported FI ( aOR = 0 . 11 , 95 % CI : 0 . 03 – 0 . 41 ) . In NYC , all income subcategories except one ( $ 100 , 000 – $ 124 , 999 ) were significantly associated with FI after adjustment for covariates .

Respondents with health conditions had higher odds to have reported FI in Chicago and NYC ( aOR = 1 . 76 , 95 % CI : 1 . 08 – 2 . 85 , aOR = 1 . 95 , 95 % CI : 1 . 28 – 2 . 97 , respectively ) . People with self - reported depression had greater odds to have reported FI in Chicago and NYC ( aOR = 1 . 9 , 95 % CI : 1 . 08 – 3 . 34 , aOR = 2 . 37 , 95 % CI : 1 . 45 – 3 . 87 , respectively ) . Chicago respondents who had public health insurance had lower odds to have reported FI compared to respondents who had private health insurance ( aOR = 0 . 56 , 95 % CI : 0 . 34 – 0 . 93 ) . In NYC , the respondent’s type of health insurance had no significant association with FI . Respondents in Chicago over 56 years of age had fewer odds to have reported FI compared to those 18 to 39 years old ( aOR = 0 . 34 , 95 % CI : 0 . 15 – 0 . 8 ) . Females in NYC had lower odds to have reported FI ( aOR = 0 . 59 , 95 % CI : 0 . 38 – 0 . 91 ) compared to males . Respondents in NYC who identified as Hispanic had fewer odds to have reported FI compared to non - Hispanic respondents ( aOR = 0 . 44 , 95 % CI : 0 . 29 – 0 . 68 ) . Educational attainment showed no association with FI in Chicago or NYC . Since COVID‑19 As shown in Table 5 , income subcategories either lost their significant association with FI or had their association sig - nificance reduced in Chicago and NYC . Most respondents of different income subcategories had their reported FI adjusted odds reduced since COVID compared to before . Income sub - categories ranging from $ 50 , 000 to $ 124 , 999 per year lost their significant association among NYC respondents and remained significant among Chicago respondents . In general , income sub - categories remained significantly associated with lower adjusted odds of FI with various degrees in Chicago and NYC . Households with children had higher odds to have reported FI in Chicago and NYC ( aOR = 1 . 78 , 95 % CI : 1 . 15 – 2 . 76 , aOR = 2 . 35 , 95 % CI : 1 . 48 – 3 . 72 , respectively ) . Among respond - ents who reported living with chronic health conditions , there was an increase in the odds of reported FI since COVID - 19 . Respondents living with health conditions had higher odds to have reported FI in Chicago and NYC ( aOR = 1 . 97 , 95 % CI : 1 . 23 – 3 . 15 , aOR = 2 . 2 , 95 % CI : 1 . 43 – 3 . 39 , respectively ) . Chi - cago respondents with a positive anxiety screen had higher odds to have reported FI ( aOR = 1 . 97 , 95 % CI : 1 . 23 – 3 . 15 ) . Respond - ents with a positive depression screen in NYC had more than two times the odds to have reported FI ( aOR = 2 . 52 , 95 % CI : 1 . 52 – 4 . 18 ) . Compared to respondents with private health insurance , NYC respondents with public health insurance or no health insurance were at increased odds to have reported FI ( aOR = 2 , 95 % CI : 1 . 26 – 3 . 18 , aOR = 2 . 22 , 95 % CI : 1 . 05 – 4 . 73 , respectively ) . Having health insurance and the type of health insurance were significantly associated with FI in NYC since COVID - 19 compared to before COVID - 19 . In Chicago , this factor lost its significant association with FI since COVID - 19 . Since COVID - 19 , respondents in Chicago over 56 years of age had fewer odds to have reported FI compared to those 18 to 39 years old ( aOR = 0 . 39 , 95 % CI : 0 . 17 – 0 . 9 ) . Females in NYC had lower odds to have reported FI ( aOR = 0 . 6 , 95 % CI : 0 . 38 – 0 . 93 ) . Being female in Chicago was not significantly associated with FI . NYC respondents who identified as His - panic no longer had a significant association with lower odds of reported FI since COVID - 19 compared to before COVID - 19 . Educational attainment was not significantly associated with FI in either city since COVID - 19 . Discussion Overall , the results of the analyses for Chicago and NYC returned similar trends and associations . In both cities , FI increased since COVID - 19 , with minor deviations for unique scenarios in either Chicago or NYC . Increases in FI for NYC and Chicago have been reported elsewhere [ 43 – 45 ] . This is unsurprising consider - ing the intensity with which the COVID - 19 pandemic affected U . S . urban areas [ 46 ] . Chicago and NYC are two of the three largest metropolitan areas in the USA and urban research has confirmed the vulnerability of large cities to pandemics and infec - tious diseases [ 47 ] . However , our findings are higher compared to other sources , likely because we oversampled populations previ - ously known to experience higher rates of FI [ 8 , 16 , 17 ] . Our study reports that , before COVID - 19 , income was significantly associated across nearly all subcategories across both cities , with higher income as a protective factor against FI in Chicago . Here , we used income as an indicator variable for economic stability in the Healthy People 2030 goals , as is common in the SDOH framework [ 48 ] . In the examined time period since COVID - 19 , high income subcategories did not appear to be protective against FI in NYC . Findings also reveal income’s relevance to FI as low - income populations saw higher odds of FI and , since COVID - 19 , the protective effects of income were reduced or eliminated in both cities [ 49 ] .

These results support other research that finds households with children experienced higher odds of FI than those without chil - dren [ 50 ] . A possible common explanation across the two cities could be the sudden loss of free school meals with school dis - trict closures . With schools closed , families would be expected to experience an increase in spending on food to account for any meals provided by the school , across each school - aged child in the household . For instance , there are 337 , 664 children attending Table 5 Multivariate binary logistic regression aOR adjusted odds ratio . * p < 0 . 05 , * * p < 0 . 01 , * * * p < 0 . 001 . † Black , Indigenous , and People Of Color Indicators FI before COVID - 19 aOR ( 95 % CI ) FI since COVID - 19 aOR ( 95 % CI ) Chicago ( n = 489 ) NYC ( n = 502 ) Chicago ( n = 497 ) NYC ( n = 502 ) Household’s income range , 2019 Less than $ 12 , 999 per year - - - - $ 13 , 000 – $ 24 , 999 per year 0 . 58 ( 0 . 28 – 1 . 23 ) 0 . 44 ( 0 . 21 – 0 . 91 ) * 0 . 97 ( 0 . 46 – 2 . 05 ) 0 . 75 ( 0 . 35 – 1 . 6 ) $ 25 , 000 – $ 49 , 999 per year 0 . 33 ( 0 . 17 – 0 . 65 ) * * 0 . 33 ( 0 . 17 – 0 . 63 ) * * 0 . 54 ( 0 . 28 – 1 . 06 ) 0 . 43 ( 0 . 22 – 0 . 84 ) * $ 50 , 000 – $ 74 , 999 per year 0 . 24 ( 0 . 11 – 0 . 49 ) * * * 0 . 41 ( 0 . 2 – 0 . 86 ) * 0 . 43 ( 0 . 21 – 0 . 88 ) * 0 . 68 ( 0 . 32 – 1 . 43 ) $ 75 , 000 – $ 99 , 999 per year 0 . 34 ( 0 . 16 – 0 . 74 ) * * 0 . 31 ( 0 . 13 – 0 . 75 ) * * 0 . 4 ( 0 . 18 – 0 . 88 ) * 0 . 55 ( 0 . 22 – 1 . 37 ) $ 100 , 000 – $ 124 , 999 per year 0 . 23 ( 0 . 08 – 0 . 63 ) * * 0 . 47 ( 0 . 17 – 1 . 29 ) 0 . 28 ( 0 . 1 – 0 . 74 ) * 0 . 46 ( 0 . 16 – 1 . 27 ) $ 125 , 000 or greater per year 0 . 11 ( 0 . 03 – 0 . 41 ) * * 0 . 25 ( 0 . 11 – 0 . 61 ) * * 0 . 18 ( 0 . 05 – 0 . 63 ) * * 0 . 3 ( 0 . 12 – 0 . 71 ) * * Children in the household No - - - - Yes 1 . 22 ( 0 . 78 – 1 . 93 ) 2 . 62 ( 1 . 68 – 4 . 1 ) * * * 1 . 78 ( 1 . 15 – 2 . 76 ) * * 2 . 35 ( 1 . 48 – 3 . 72 ) * * * Health condition No - - - - Yes 1 . 76 ( 1 . 08 – 2 . 85 ) * 1 . 95 ( 1 . 28 – 2 . 97 ) * * 1 . 97 ( 1 . 23 – 3 . 15 ) * * 2 . 2 ( 1 . 43 – 3 . 39 ) * * * Anxiety screen Negative - - - - Positive 1 . 58 ( 0 . 9 – 2 . 76 ) 1 . 11 ( 0 . 67 – 1 . 84 ) 1 . 97 ( 1 . 15 – 3 . 38 ) * 1 . 27 ( 0 . 76 – 2 . 14 ) Depression screen Negative - - - - Positive 1 . 9 ( 1 . 08 – 3 . 34 ) * 2 . 37 ( 1 . 45 – 3 . 87 ) * * 1 . 62 ( 0 . 94 – 2 . 78 ) 2 . 52 ( 1 . 52 – 4 . 18 ) * * * Health insurance Private health insurance - - - - Public health insurance 0 . 56 ( 0 . 34 – 0 . 93 ) * 1 . 24 ( 0 . 79 – 1 . 95 ) 0 . 76 ( 0 . 46 – 1 . 24 ) 2 ( 1 . 26 – 3 . 18 ) * * No health insurance 1 . 09 ( 0 . 59 – 2 . 04 ) 1 . 56 ( 0 . 76 – 3 . 2 ) 1 . 27 ( 0 . 68 – 2 . 37 ) 2 . 22 ( 1 . 05 – 4 . 73 ) * Age 18 – 39 - - - - 40 – 55 0 . 6 ( 0 . 34 – 1 . 05 ) 0 . 65 ( 0 . 38 – 1 . 11 ) 0 . 63 ( 0 . 37 – 1 . 07 ) 0 . 74 ( 0 . 43 – 1 . 28 ) 56 + 0 . 34 ( 0 . 15 – 0 . 8 ) * 0 . 56 ( 0 . 27 – 1 . 16 ) 0 . 39 ( 0 . 17 – 0 . 9 ) * 0 . 76 ( 0 . 37 – 1 . 58 ) Gender Male - - - - Female 1 . 16 ( 0 . 75 – 1 . 78 ) 0 . 59 ( 0 . 38 – 0 . 91 ) * 1 . 15 ( 0 . 75 – 1 . 74 ) 0 . 6 ( 0 . 38 – 0 . 93 ) * Race / ethnicity Non - Hispanic White - - - - BIPOC † 1 . 28 ( 0 . 7 – 2 . 31 ) 0 . 54 ( 0 . 22 – 1 . 37 ) 1 . 67 ( 0 . 93 – 2 . 98 ) 0 . 87 ( 0 . 36 – 2 . 06 ) Non - Hispanic - - - - Hispanic 0 . 82 ( 0 . 5 – 1 . 35 ) 0 . 44 ( 0 . 29 – 0 . 68 ) * * * 0 . 97 ( 0 . 6 – 1 . 56 ) 1 . 05 ( 0 . 67 – 1 . 64 ) Education Graduate and postgraduate - - - - College 1 . 48 ( 0 . 51 – 2 . 61 ) 1 . 11 ( 0 . 56 – 2 . 23 ) 0 . 86 ( 0 . 41 – 1 . 79 ) 0 . 87 ( 0 . 43 – 2 . 17 ) Up to high school 1 . 5 ( 0 . 62 – 3 . 64 ) 1 . 1 ( 0 . 5 – 2 . 42 ) 0 . 88 ( 0 . 39 – 1 . 99 ) 0 . 97 ( 0 . 43 – 2 . 17 ) Area Under ROC curve 0 . 7634 0 . 7685 0 . 7568 0 . 7548 1711 Journal of Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities ( 2023 ) 10 : 1703 – 1720 1 3 642 K - 12 public schools in Chicago and 1 . 1 million children attending 1866 K - 12 public schools in NYC [ 51 ] . In NYC public schools , 73 percent of 1 . 1 million students experience poverty and therefore qualify for free or reduced lunches [ 52 ] . Similarly , respondents living with chronic health conditions had higher odds of being FI in Chicago and NYC . Our find - ings corroborate with the literature indicating that people who live in FI households often face difficulties in managing diet - related chronic conditions , including being on a limited budget and restricted healthcare access [ 53 ] . These conditions also place them at a higher risk of COVID - 19 infections and death , such as obesity , diabetes mellitus , hypertension , and heart disease [ 40 ] . Again , respondents living with chronic health conditions had higher odds of being FI since COVID - 19 began , understandably , given the sudden and drastic decline in access to health care due to the immediate infrastructural and institutional shutdowns [ 2 ] . Since COVID - 19 , FI has been identified as a major predictor of depression , anxiety , and high stress among low - income Ameri - cans [ 20 , 21 ] . Even prior to the pandemic , FI has been a well - known predictor for mental health factors , including major depres - sion and anxiety [ 54 ] . However , it should be noted that there is a bidirectionality to the relationship between FI and mental health , and therefore , we cannot infer causality [ 55 ] . Depression had two times greater odds to be associated with FI in NYC and was asso - ciated with higher FI in Chicago . Research shows that financial insecurity and FI create feelings of sadness , hopelessness , shame , guilt , and anxiety [ 56 ] . It is possible that social isolation since COVID - 19 exacerbated these feelings and increased depression and / or depression symptoms in individuals [ 2 ] . Furthermore , Chicago respondents who had public health insurance had fewer odds to be FI , while in NYC , the type of health insurance a respondent had showed no significant association with FI . This could be due to differences between access and affordability of health insurance in both cities , including public health insurance . Our findings differ from other studies , in particular research that shows Medicare enrollees to have higher odds to experience FI [ 57 ] . Age was inversely associated with the odds of being FI before COVID - 19 in both cities , but age was only significant in Chicago since the onset of COVID - 19 . It is important to note that the study is limited in evaluating the relationship between age and FI , since age was measured as a categorical variable with three categories , and age of the participants is not representative of the population . Overall , our results confirm that age is a significant predictor for FI in Chicago , but there was no significance in NYC . FI is most prevalent among females in a household with chil - dren [ 54 ] . Females had greater odds of being FI before COVID - 19 began in NYC potentially due to the high cost of living , if women are assumed to earn lower incomes and bear greater care responsibili - ties [ 58 , 59 ] . Female caregivers with children may also have gained access to school meal programs and other related programs before , but not early during , the COVID - 19 pandemic . At the start of the pandemic , all Chicago Public School ( CPS ) students were eligible to receive meals . CPS increased food accessibility for children and families by providing “grab and go” family food packages that con - tained up to 3 days’ worth of food for breakfast and dinner [ 60 ] . In addition , CPS students received up to $ 450 distributed through a P - EBT card to meet food needs , increasing food accessibility [ 61 ] . The confluence of NYC’s higher population density , higher cost of living , greater relative poverty , and the public’s higher dependence on public transportation and therefore inability to avoid crowds may help explain some of the greater disparate effects across gender , caused by the early first wave of the pandemic when NYC was the epicenter [ 62 ] . However , further studies are needed with a larger sample size , to make such assessments . Findings of earlier studies in Chicago support our findings that , pre - COVID , BIPOC households in Chicago had higher odds of experiencing FI [ 26 , 63 ] . Notably , a larger proportion of BIPOC households , not Hispanic households , in NYC appeared to be better protected from FI since COVID - 19 than before the pandemic . This pattern was not observed among BIPOC in Chi - cago . Because BIPOC households in NYC had differing results than the Hispanic population in NYC , as well as both BIPOC and Hispanic households in Chicago , the data suggests that we need a closer look at the local policies and programs in place as well as other potential factors influencing FI protections for historically marginalized communities in both cities [ 64 ] . Using slightly dif - ferent nested quotas in the sampling designs for NYC and Chi - cago , as well as the different proportion of White respondents in the two cities , could have contributed to different outcomes for BIPOC and Hispanic respondents . It should be noted that our study was not powered to detect differences across specific race or ethnicity groups , except for Hispanic , despite our intention to oversample households affected by FI . Finally , educational attainment served as a proxy vari - able for quality access to education in the SDOH framework [ 6 ] . While not unimportant to conversations about economic instability , our findings showed that educational attainment had no significant association with self - reported FI status , when comparing the periods before COVID - 19 and since the onset of COVID - 19 in March 2020 . Conclusion Our study found that FI increased since COVID - 19 in both Chicago and NYC for BIPOC populations known to be vul - nerable to FI . While FI increased since COVID - 19 in both Chicago and NYC , SDOH factors across the two cities did not show substantially different effects on FI since COVID - 19 , aside from specific cases such as females and Hispanics in NYC . Our study was exploratory in nature , conducted in the early months of the COVID - 19 pandemic , cross - sec - tional in design , and oversampled for BIPOC . These urban centers are densely populated and often experience “staggering income inequalities” among a 1712 Journal of Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities ( 2023 ) 10 : 1703 – 1720 1 3 heterogeneous population with a mix of diverse races , cul - tures , and backgrounds [ 62 , 65 ] . Population density in NYC ( 26 , 403 people per square mile ) is over 2 . 2 times greater than Chicago ( 11 , 783 people per square mile ) . Manhattan alone , the borough with the highest population density at more than 66 , 000 people per square mile , is 5 . 6 times greater than Chicago [ 66 ] . In turn , the dense social composition of NYC impacted people across all income brackets , helping to explain that in our study , high income was not a protective factor in NYC . Beyond general population density , over - crowding has been linked to COVID - 19 risks of exposure , regardless of geography [ 67 ] . Moreover , there may be wider social and economic dis - parities in NYC , as evidenced by higher costs of living and greater relative poverty . In fact , NYC has continued to be reported as being the most expensive city in the USA , com - pared to other large American cities such as San Francisco , Boston , Chicago , and Los Angeles [ 68 ] . In NYC , higher costs of living ( i . e . , out - of - pocket rent expenses ) are often associ - ated with not only lower levels of economic achievement , but also worse self - reported health conditions and a higher likelihood of postponing medical services for financial rea - sons [ 69 ] . In NYC , the cost of living index data is 1 . 6 times higher than Chicago : based on a Composite Index of 100 % , 116 . 9 % for Chicago , and 185 . 8 % for NYC ( combined aver - age of Manhattan [ 216 . 7 % ] , Brooklyn [ 181 . 7 % ] , and Queens [ 159 % ] ) [ 70 ] . Despite these differences , we did not find sub - stantial differences in FI before and since COVID - 19 for the two cities . Income inequality was associated with FI before COVID - 19 in both cities . However , since COVID - 19 , increasing annual income was either lost or diminished in its association with FI . Aside from income , employment and access to quality education are compo - nents of economic instability within the SDOH framework . Ulti - mately , employment was not included in this study as income and education have been sufficient proxy variables across COVID - 19 FI studies [ 44 , 45 , 71 ] . However , we believe there is a complex relationship surrounding the type and nature of employment that needs future exploration . Access to quality education , through the educational attainment variable , was not significant in our study . This study shows that beyond income , other structural , social , and health inequities had a greater impact on predicting FI since COVID - 19 in both cities . When accounted for , such factors diminished the protective effect of increasing annual income against FI . We recognize the limitations of using income as an indicator of economic standing . Future studies will expand beyond income to discuss variables such as educational attainment , employment status , and types of employment as additional indicators of economic well - being . Age is a characteristic often linked to or dependent on other factors such as gender , race and ethnicity , and social class , build - ing on what Estes [ 72 ] calls an interlocking system of oppres - sion that is interactional in nature . Similar to the conclusions drawn from our BIPOC results , future studies need to be larger to capture the nature of age , which may have adverse effects on young populations ( i . e . , teenagers ) , in addition to any elderly - related results . In order to truly understand the impact of an emergency or crisis on FI , we need to further study the intersec - tionality of race , ethnicity , gender , and low - income populations . Our study is useful for understanding how SDOH influ - ence COVID - 19’s impacts on FI among BIPOC popula - tions in general . While we oversampled for specific race and ethnicity groups , the study was not sufficiently pow - ered to detect differences among groups . Since our study design is cross - sectional , findings indicate associations and cannot determine causality or temporality . Despite the limitations of our study , higher rates of FI were reported for our sample population across both sites . Additionally , similar studies confirm not only the continuation of FI since COVID - 19 , but also suggest amplified outcomes on households with children as well as widening dietary ineq - uities across low - income and BIPOC households [ 43 – 45 ] . These results underscore the early impact of the pandemic on existing socioeconomic inequities affecting BIPOC populations , as well as the higher prevalence of FI among these communities before the pandemic [ 26 ] . Similarly , our transgender , non - binary , and other gender categories did not have sufficient statistical power to be tested as their own category . As the world rapidly urbanizes , studying urban centers can ultimately unlock the key to future public health solu - tions [ 73 ] . Despite observed differences between Chicago and NYC , the magnitude of the results does not change the overall rise of FI reported in all US cities studied by NFACT publications . Singularly testing each variable for its predictive capacity on FI may have overlooked inter - locking influences , also referred to as syndemics theory [ 74 ] . As we do more research at the intersection of income , food , and health security , we can discover more common - alities across insecure communities and account for emerg - ing insecure groups . Future studies should address the intersectionality of demographic characteristics on outcomes like FI instead of relying on the predictive power of any single factor . Further evidence on the drivers of FI , and how we can predict and combat further increases in FI , can enable us to better alleviate the issue via policy solutions . From a policy perspective , Chicago continues to increase acces - sibility through the new “Food Equity Agenda , ” a multi - year project to transform the food system in Chicago . The goals of the agenda are to eliminate barriers for food pantry expansions , eliminate barriers to urban farming , market nutrition programs and benefits , support local BIPOC food business , and increase funding for BIPOC food producers and businesses [ 75 ] . The results have multifaceted , structural policy implications insofar as income does not necessarily indicate food security , 1713 Journal of Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities ( 2023 ) 10 : 1703 – 1720 1 3 which could question the means - tested approach of social policies in the USA . For example , along with demographic and employment information , applications for programs such as SNAP require disclosure of income . As applications for benefits become more user - friendly , accounting for categories like chronic health conditions or health insurance status can better address issues of FI . This study corroborates other recent publications that call for a paradigmatic shift in our policies by taking a human rights framework to address upstream social and economic determinants of health that create health dispari - ties to eliminate FI [ 26 ] . Moreover , further studies that include food security as a SDOH are necessary to inform targeted improvements in social protection policies and programs .
