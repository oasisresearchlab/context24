RNA interference ( RNAi ) has recently emerged as a speciﬁ c and efﬁ cient method to silence gene expression in mammalian cells either by transfection of short interfering RNAs ( siRNAs ; ref . 1 ) or , more recently , by transcription of short hairpin RNAs ( shRNAs ) from expression vectors and retroviruses 2 – 10 . But the resistance of important cell types to transduction by these approaches , both in vitro and in vivo 11 , has limited the use of RNAi . Here we describe a lentiviral system for delivery of shR - NAs into cycling and non - cycling mammalian cells , stem cells , zygotes and their differentiated progeny . We show that len - tivirus - delivered shRNAs are capable of speciﬁ c , highly stable and functional silencing of gene expression in a variety of cell types and also in transgenic mice . Our lentiviral vectors should permit rapid and efﬁ cient analysis of gene function in primary human and animal cells and tissues and generation of animals that show reduced expression of speciﬁ c genes . They may also provide new approaches for gene therapy . Rapid progress in sequencing genes and characterizing their expression patterns has resulted in a growing list of coding regions predicted to contribute to mammalian tissue function and the development of disease . Current approaches to study gene function , such as generating knockout mice , are time - consuming and expensive and cannot be applied to human tissues .

Retroviral vectors are efﬁ cient , stable gene delivery tools in mammalian cells 13 , 14 , and recent studies suggest that they can stably express shRNAs in transformed and primary cells 10 . We have devel - oped a lentivirus - based vector ( pLL3 . 7 ) that expresses RNAi - inducing shRNAs under the control of the U6 promoter ( Fig . 1 a ; ref . 15 ) . This vector was engineered to co - express enhanced green ﬂ uorescent protein ( EGFP ) as a reporter gene , permit - ting infected cells to be tracked by ﬂ ow cytometry ( Fig . 1 a , d ) . Lentiviruses have two key advantages over other gene deliv - ery systems . First , they can infect non - cycling and post - mitotic cells 16 , 17 . Second , transgenes expressed from lentiviruses are not silenced during development and can be used to generate trans - genic animals through infection of embryonic stem ( ES ) cells or embryos 18 , 19 . Initial experiments indicated that pLL3 . 7 vectors could gener - ate high - titre infectious lenti - viruses that expressed shRNAs and silenced gene expression upon infection of mammalian cell lines ( Fig . - - 1 d – d – d f – f – ) . We next f ) . We next f tested whether pLL3 . 7 could silence gene expression in primary mammalian cells by infecting OVA - speciﬁ c CD8 - positive OTI T cells derived from T - cell receptor transgenic mice 20 . T cells were activated with cognate peptide in vitro and infected with a version of pLL3 . 7 engineered to express an shRNA that silences expression of mouse CD8 α ( pLL3 . 7 CD8 ; Fig . 1 b , c ; refs . 4 , 21 ) . Flow cyto - metric analysis showed that 68 – 82 % of the cells were infected and reproducibly showed approximately 93 % lower expression of CD8 ( Fig . 2 a ) , indicating that lentivirus - driven expression of shRNAs efﬁ ciently Fig . 2 Functional silencing of genes Functional silencing of genes in cycling and non - cycling primary immune cells in vitro and in vivo by a lentiviral vector . a , Speciﬁ c silencing of genes in cycling T cells by pLL3 . 7 CD8 and pLL3 . 7 CD25 .

The efﬁ ciency of infection was determined by assaying GFP expression by ﬂ ow cytom - etry ( left histogram , green line ) and compared with uninfected cells ( purple peak ) . Bone marrow chimeras were generated by injecting sorted ( GFP - positive ) HSCs into lethally irradiated recipients . The contribution of these cells to the mature spleen cells of the chimeras was determined by staining with the congenic marker CD45 . 2 , analyzing GFP expression by ﬂ ow cytometry ( right histogram , green line ) , and comparing with mice that received uninfected HSCs ( purple peak ) .

This effect of pLL3 . 7 CD8 was speciﬁ c , as infected T cells showed normal expression of other T - cell surface markers ( Fig . 2 a and data not shown ) . To determine whether pLL3 . 7 - based vectors could also silence gene expression in non - cycling cells , we infected dendritic cells with RNAi lentiviruses that expressed shRNAs against the pro - apoptotic molecule Bim ( ref . 22 ; pLL3 . 7 Bim ) . Infection of these cells was efﬁ cient , as gauged by expression of green ﬂ uorescent protein ( GFP ) , and resulted in a reduction of Bim expression ( Fig . 2 b ) . To determine whether lentivirus - mediated expression of shR - NAs could induce functional silencing of a gene in primary cells , we infected OTI T cells with an RNAi lentivirus that targeted CD25 , the IL - 2 receptor α - chain ( pLL3 . 7 CD25 ; Fig . 2 a ) . IL - 2 is an important growth factor for T cells , and T cells derived from mice that lack CD25 do not proliferate in vitro 23 . Activated OTI T cells infected with pLL3 . 7 CD25 showed a 95 % reduc - tion in IL - 2R α chain expression , but expressed normal levels of other surface markers ( Fig . 2 a and data not shown ) . These cells showed a 75 – 80 % reduction in proliferation when challenged with increasing concentrations of IL - 2 ( Fig . 2 c ) . As not all cells were infected in these experiments ( typically 70 – 85 % of cells were GFP - positive ) , the actual inhibition of IL - 2 – induced proliferation by RNAi was probably even more signiﬁ cant . Lentivirus - based vectors are capable of stably expressing transgenes in stem cells and are not silenced during development 14 , 18 . We tested whether pLL3 . 7 could be used to silence gene expression in hematopoietic stem cells ( HSCs ) and their prog - eny . HSCs puriﬁ ed from whole bone marrow by cell sorting were infected with pLL3 . 7 or pLL3 . 7 CD8 and then cultured for 2 days in the presence of cytokines . This protocol led to infection of 30 – 60 % of HSCs ( Fig . 2 d and data not shown ) . Next , GFP - d and data not shown ) . Next , GFP - d positive cells were sorted and injected into lethally irradiated congenic mice . After 8 weeks , the injected HSCs had contributed to all blood cell lineages in reconstituted mice , as determined by staining for the congenic CD45 allele , and about 20 – 40 % of HSC - derived lymphocytes were GFP - positive ( Fig . 2 d ) . The presence of GFP - negative cells is probably the consequence of the low activity of the CMV promoter in these cells 24 . To examine whether len - tivirus - mediated expression of shRNAs in T cells resulted in gene silencing in vivo , we analyzed splenocytes from reconsti - tuted mice . Mice that received HSCs infected with pLL3 . 7 CD8 showed at least a 90 % reduction in the frequency of CD8 + T cells when compared with those receiving HSCs infected with pLL3 . 7 ( Fig . 2 e ) . No effect was seen on CD4 - positive T cell lev - els and other immune cell populations , indicating that lentivi - rus - induced gene silencing was both functional and speciﬁ c . We serially passaged bone marrow cells from reconstituted mice and still observed lentivirus - driven expression of GFP in hematopoietic cells ( data not shown ) , conﬁ rming that we had infected true stem cells . Lentiviruses have also been reported to infect mouse ES cells and to maintain their expression in transgenic mice generated from these cells 18 . We generated stable lines of ES cells that were infected with pLL3 . 7 CD8 or with versions of pLL3 . 7 that expressed shRNAs against p53 ( ref . 6 ; pLL3 . 7 p53 ) or a neuron - speciﬁ c isoform of Mena ( ref . 25 ; pLL3 . 7 Mena + ; Fig . 3 a and data not shown ) . To test whether gene silencing could be main - tained throughout organogenesis , we puriﬁ ed GFP - positive Table 1 • Efﬁ cient generation of RNAi transgenic mice through infection of zygotes with lentiviruses Number of Average number RNA Total mice transgenic offspring of lentiviral lentivirus Litters born ( percentage ) integrants ( range ) Control 2 15 8 ( 53 % ) 3 . 4 ( 2 – 5 ) CD8 4 32 16 ( 50 % ) 3 . 1 ( 2 – 6 ) CD25 7 42 11 ( 26 % ) nd P53 4 22 5 ( 23 % ) nd RNAi transgenic mice were generated with pLL3 . 7 ( control ) , pLL3 . 7 CD8 , pLL3 . 7 CD25 and pLL3 . 7 p53 .

Because RAG deﬁ ciency blocks T and B lymphocyte development in the bone marrow , any peripheral T and B lymphocytes present in the chimeric progeny must be derived from the injected ( RAG - positive ) ES cells 26 . The degree of chimerism in animals derived from infected ES cells varied between 50 % and 90 % , as gauged by GFP ﬂ uorescence of whole mice and dissected organs ( Fig . 3 c and data not shown ) . About c and data not shown ) . About c 20 – 40 % of immune cells in these mice were GFP - positive ( Fig . 3 b and data not shown ) . To examine whether lentivirus - medi - ated expression of shRNAs resulted in the silencing of CD8 in vivo , we stained thymus and spleen cells of 7 - day - old chime - ric mice with antibodies to CD8 and CD4 and analyzed them by ﬂ ow cytometry . Developing T cells in the thymus of pLL3 . 7 CD8 – infected mice showed an 89 % reduction in CD8 expres - sion ( Fig . 3 d ) . In addition , we detected few mature CD8 - posi - tive T cells in this organ or in the spleen ( Fig . 3 d ) . By contrast , these mice showed normal expression of CD4 on thymocytes and normal percentages of mature CD4 - positive T cells in immune tissues ( Fig . 3 d ) . No effects were observed on T - cell differentiation and frequencies in mice derived from ES cells infected with pLL3 . 7 Mena + and pLL3 . 7 ( Fig . 3 d and data not d and data not d shown ) . Direct lentiviral infection of single - cell embryos provides an efﬁ cient and broadly applicable approach to generate trans - genic animals 19 . We infected single - cell embryos with RNAi lentiviruses to determine whether this methodology could be used to bypass the use of ES cells . Embryos infected with pLL3 . 7 , pLL3 . 7 CD8 , pLL3 . 7 CD25 , pLL3 . 7 p53 or pLL3 . 7 Mena + expressed GFP after 3 days in culture ( Fig . 4 a and data not shown ) and produced offspring that showed expression of GFP and siRNAs in all tissues tested ( Table 1 , Fig . 4 b , c and c and c data not shown ) . As in ES cell chimeras , 2 - week - old transgenic mice generated from pLL3 . 7 CD8 – infected zygotes showed a 91 % reduction in CD8 expression in developing thymocytes ( Table 2 and Fig . 4 d ) . The frequency of mature CD8 - positive T cells in the peripheral lymphoid organs of these mice was also reduced ( Table 2 and Fig . 4 d ) . Notably , gene silencing was maintained in adult mice ( Table 2 ) . As in HSC - reconstituted and ES cell chimeric mice , the expression of GFP in immune cells of RNAi transgenic mice generated with pLL3 . 7 vectors was low ( 5 – 60 % ) . In all mice , cells exhibiting silencing showed an equal reduction of CD8 gene expression , but the percentage of cells showing silencing differed between transgenic strains ( Table 2 ) . This variation may be a function of the number of integrated lentiviral genomes present in different transgenic lines ( Table 2 ) . Gene silencing was not restricted to immune cells ; brain and liver cells derived from transgenic mice that expressed pLL3 . 7 p53 showed reduced expression of the p53 tumor - sup - pressor protein ( Fig . 4 e ) . The promise of RNAi to efﬁ ciently silence genes in mammalian cells is widely recognized 12 , 15 , 27 , 28 . The results presented here show that lentiviruses can be used to deliver shRNAs and reduce gene expression in cycling and non - cycling cells , as well as in chimeric and transgenic mice . This technology should allow systematic genetic analysis in most cell types and tissues , including those of human ori - gin , and facilitate comprehen - sive studies of gene function in mice and in species that are not traditionally amenable to genetic manipulation . Lentiviral expression vectors might be used therapeutically to silence disease - causing genes , to ren - der cells resistant to infectious organisms , and to facilitate the creation of tissues deﬁ cient in speciﬁ c antigens as a source of transplant organs . Future modiﬁ cations to lentiviral expres - sion vectors , such as the inclusion of inducible or tissue - speciﬁ c promoters , will extend the range of cells and situations in which they can induce RNAi . Methods RNAi lentivirus system . The complete details of the construction of pLL3 . 7 and other LentiLox vectors are described online ( see URL ) . In brief , the pBFGW plasmid 19 was extensively modiﬁ ed to carry lox P sites , a CMV promoter driving expression of EGFP and the mouse U6 promoter with downstream restriction sites ( Hpa I and Xho I ) to allow the efﬁ cient intro - duction of oligonucleotides encoding shRNAs ( Fig . 1 a , b , c ) . To conﬁ rm that pLL3 . 7 could silence gene expression in mammalian cells , we used an shRNA predicted to target the α - chain of CD8 to generate pLL3 . 7 CD8 ( Fig . 1 b , c ) . The CD8 shRNA was based on previously pub - lished sequences 4 , 21 . We generated lentivirus particles ( as described below ) and used them to infect E10 cells . Infected ( GFP - positive ) cells showed on average a 94 % reduction of CD8 expression ( Fig . 1 d ) . Inhibition of CD8 expression was speciﬁ c , as the levels of other surface proteins were not altered ( Fig . 1 d and data not shown ) . Moreover , in a subline of E10 cells d and data not shown ) . Moreover , in a subline of E10 cells d engineered to express human CD8 , which differs from mouse CD8 by 4 of 19 nt in the targeted region , only the mouse gene was silenced ( data not shown ) . Cells infected with control virus ( pLL3 . 7 ) or viruses expressing shRNAs against other genes showed no decrease in CD8 levels ( Fig . 1 d and d and d data not shown ) . To conﬁ rm that the decrease in surface expression of CD8 seen in infected E10 cells resulted from mRNA degradation , CD8 transcript lev - els in sorted ( GFP - positive ) cell populations infected with either pLL3 . 7 CD8 or a control virus were quantiﬁ ed by northern blotting ( Fig . 1 e ) . E10 cells that showed silencing expressed short RNAs of approximately 21 nt that were complimentary to an anti - sense strand of the CD8 stem loop , indicating that lentivirus - encoded shRNAs were being expressed and processed into siRNAs ( Fig . 1 f ) . To test the stability of lentivirus - f ) . To test the stability of lentivirus - f induced RNAi in mammalian cells , we followed expression of CD8 in long - term cultures of E10 cells infected with pLL3 . 7 or pLL3 . 7 CD8 and sorted for expression of GFP . E10 cells infected with pLL3 . 7 CD8 virus were sorted 4 d after infection for GFP expression and low CD8 expres - sion , whereas control virus infected cells were sorted for GFP expres - sion only ( Fig . 1 d ) . Each population was cultured for 1 mo and analyzed for CD8 expression by ﬂ ow cytometry at weekly intervals . We saw no change in expression of this surface receptor over the course of 1 mo , and these cells remained uniformly GFP - positive ( Fig . 1 d ) . But in each experiment a small fraction ( 2 – 10 % ) of infected ( GFP - positive ) E10 cells showed no evidence of gene silencing . These cells were shown to Table 2 • Stable and functional silencing in adult RNAi transgenic mice Age of RNAi transgenic mice ( wk ) 2 8 8 8 8 8 9 9 Percent decrease in CD8 expression 93 93 93 88 87 92 94 94 Decrease in percentage of mature 56 20 35 44 99 100 46 56 CD8 - positive cells Number of lentiviral integrants nd 2 3 2 6 5 4 3 The frequency of CD8 - positive T cells present in neonatal and adult CD8 RNAi transgenic mice and age - matched con - trols , and the reduction of CD8 expression in cells showing gene silencing , were determined by staining lymphocytes with antibodies to Thy1 , CD4 and CD8 . The percent reduction in CD8 - positive T cells seen in CD8 RNAi transgenic mice was determined by dividing the percentage of splenic T cells that were CD8 - positive in CD8 RNAi transgenic mice by the percentage observed in control mice . The percent reduction in CD8 expression was determined by dividing the mean ﬂ uorescence intensity of CD8 staining in T cells ( Thy1 - positive ) from CD8 RNAi transgenic mice that showed silencing by the mean ﬂ uorescence intensity of CD8 on T cells from control mice .

CD8 - positive T cells were activated by culturing splenocytes derived from OTI TCR transgenic mice at a densi - ty of 2 × 10 6 cells ml – 1 in the presence of 1 µ g ml – 1 of OVA peptide and 100 ng ml – 1 IL - 2 ( Biosource International ) . After 24 h and 48 h , cultures were supplemented with 20 – 100 × 10 6 lentiviral particles ( multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) of 10 – 50 ) , 10 µ g ml – 1 Polybrene , and spun at 1 , 200 r . p . m . for 1 h at 30 ° C in a Beckman Allegra 6R centrifuge . Supernatant was removed after infection and replaced with growth medium containing 1 µ g ml – 1 OVA and 100 ng ml – 1 IL - 2 . We collected T cells for experiments after 72 h . We generated dendritic cells by culturing whole bone marrow cells for 7 d at a density of 2 × 10 6 cells ml – 1 in the presence of 20 ng ml – 1 GM - CSF ( Biosource International ) . During this culture period , fresh cyto - kine was provided every other day . The resulting cell populations were typi - cally greater than 60 % CD11c - positive as determined by ﬂ ow cytometry ( data not shown ) . On day 7 , we transferred dendritic cells to a new plate , cultured them at a density of 2 × 10 6 cells ml – 1 with medium containing no GM - CSF and infected them on day 8 and 9 with approximately 100 × 10 6 ( MOI of 50 ) lentiviral particles . Cells were collected for analysis on day 10 . Hematopoietic stem cell infection . Whole mouse bone marrow cells were depleted for cells expressing B cell ( B220 ) and granulocyte lineage mark - ers ( CD11b ) using magnetic beads ( Miltenyi ) , and then sorted for Sca1 - positive and c - Kit - positive cells . These cells were spin - infected with RNAi lentiviruses at an MOI of approximately 10 – 50 , and then cultured at a density of 2 × 10 6 cells ml – 1 for 2 d in the presence of IL - 3 ( 20 ng ml – 1 , Biosource International ) , IL - 6 ( 50 ng ml – 1 , Biosource International ) and SCF ( 50 ng ml – 1 , Peprotech ) . We sorted infected HSCs for GFP expression , after which we injected approximately 2 × 10 5 cells into lethally γ - irradi - γ - irradi - γ ated ( 1200 rads ) recipient mice that were congenic for the CD45 antigen , to allow us to distinguish host and donor cells ( HSCs were derived from a mouse strain that expresses CD45 . 2 on hematopoietic stem cells ; recipi - ent mice expressed CD45 . 1 on these cells ) . Most reconstituted mice also received 2 × 10 6 host - derived ( CD45 . 1 ) whole bone marrow cells . Bone marrow chimeras were analyzed between 6 wk and 8 wk after reconstitu - tion for GFP expression in splenocytes and CD8 gene silencing by stain - ing and ﬂ ow cytometry . In all experiments , progeny of infected HSCs were identiﬁ ed by staining for CD45 . 2 . ES cell infection . We maintained and infected AK7 ES cells as described 18 . Clones of ES cells were picked , expanded and analyzed by ﬂ ow cytom - etry for GFP expression . If the clone contained a mixed population of infected and uninfected cells , we puriﬁ ed the GFP - positive population by ﬂ uorescence - activated cell sorting before blastocyst injection . Generation of RNAi chimeric and transgenic mice . For ES cell – derived mice , we injected approximately 10 – 12 pLL3 . 7 - infected GFP - positive ES cells into Rag2 – / – blastocysts , which we then implanted into a pseu - dopregnant female recipient mouse 26 . We screened neonates resulting from these injections for chimerism by determining the level of GFP fluorescence of their skin and paws . Highly chimeric ( > 50 % ) neonates were used for analysis . To generate lentiviral transgenics , we injected a small volume of high - titre RNAi lentivirus ( 4 – 10 × 10 8 IU - - µ l – 1 ) into the perivitelline space of single - cell mouse embryos , which we then implanted into pseudopregnant female recipient mice 19 . The resulting neonates were screened for lentiviral integration by Southern blotting and expression by GFP ﬂ uorescence . Flow cytometry . The following phycoerythrin - conjugated antibodies were used for ﬂ ow cytometric analysis : antibody against CD4 ( clone RM4 - 5 ) , antibody against CD8 α ( clone 53 - 6 . 7 ) , antibody against CD25 ( clone PC81 ) , antibody against CD45 . 2 , antibody against CD95 . 2 ( Thy1 . 2 ) and strepavidin . We also used allophycocyanin - conjugated antibody against CD8 α and biotin - conjugated antibody against Thy1 . 2 for analysis . All antibodies were from BD Pharmingen . All plots shown are gated for viable cells , which were isolated by selecting PI – cells . Northern - blot analysis . For northern - blot analysis , we lysed cells with Trizol reagent ( Invitrogen ) and prepared total cellular RNA accord - ing to the manufacturer’s instructions . RNA was prepared from tissues using RNAlater ( Ambion Diagnostics ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . We carried out CD4 / CD8 probe hybridization as described 4 . For the small RNA northern blot , total RNA ( 60 µ g ) was fractionated on a 10 % denaturing polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nylon mem - brane . The membrane was hybridized to a probe consisting of a 21 - nt CD8 siRNA sense strand labeled at the 5 ′ end with 32 P . We used a 5 ′ radio - labeled oligonucleotide probe to 5S RNA to determine equal load - ing of RNA . Western - blot analysis . Mouse tissues were lysed in RIPA buffer ( 150 - - mM NaCl , 50 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 0 . 5 % sodium deoxycholate , 0 . 1 % sodium dodecylsulfate ) supplemented with Com - plete Protease Inhibitor Tablets ( Roche ) . We determined protein con - centrations using BCA Protein Assay ( Pierce ) . Equal amounts of protein ( 100 - - µ g ) were loaded per lane and separated on a 10 % SDS – PAGE gel . Protein was transferred to a PVDF membrane . We detected p53 using antibody against p53 Ab - 3 ( Oncogene Research Products ) diluted 1 : 1 , 000 and donkey antibody against mouse conjugated with horse - radish peroxidase diluted 1 : 10 , 000 . The blot was developed with ECL + reagent ( Amersham Biosciences ) . Animal care . We carried out all mouse experiments according to the guide - lines established by the Committee on Animal Care at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology or the Institutional Animal Care and Use Commit - tee at Biogen .

Genet . 33 , 401 – 406 ( 2003 ) ; published online 18 February 2003 ; corrected after print 14 May 2007 The authors wish to remove panels b , d and e of Figure 2 because they were falsified or fabricated . Figure 2 shows the functional silencing of genes in primary cells by lentiviral - mediated RNAi . The authors showed that primary activated T cells can be successfully transduced by lentivirus and that RNAi - targeted surface markers are downregulated in transduced cells ( Fig . 2a ) . This knockdown leads to a deficiency in T cell proliferation in response to IL - 2 ( Fig . 2c ) . These conclusions remain intact . Figure 2b demonstrates the transduction of bone marrow – derived dendritic cells and the knockdown of bim expression . Figure 2d shows the transduction of hematopoietic stem cells ( HSCs ) and the expression of GFP marker in splenocytes from chimeras derived from transduced HSCs . Figure 2e shows the reduction in CD8 + cells harvested in CD8 - knockdown bone marrow chimeras . However , the data supporting the transduction of dendritic cells or HSCs with the lentiviral vector pLL3 . 7 and the resulting knockdown has been determined to be falsified or fabricated , invalidating the conclusions drawn from these panels ( Fig . 2b , d , e ) . We have no reason to believe that the other results and interpretations in this paper need to be corrected . This correction follows an investigation by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology into scientific misconduct by Luk Van Parijs , the communicating author of the paper . The investigation also found that Dr . Van Parijs was solely responsible for the scientific misconduct that resulted in the falsified or fabricated data in this paper . In addition , the authors wish to revise a Corrigendum regarding this paper that was published at Dr . Van Parijs’ request ( Nat . Genet . 34 , 231 ; 2003 ) . The Corrigendum contained a revised author list that mistakenly omitted Mingdi Zhang , an author on the original paper . The complete author list is as follows : Douglas A . Rubinson , Christopher P . Dillon , Adam V . Kwiatkowski , Claudia Sievers , Lili Yang , Johnny Kopinja , Dina L . Rooney , Mingdi Zhang , Melanie M . Ihrig , Michael T . McManus , Frank B . Gertler , Martin L . Scott & Luk Van Parijs . That Corrigendum also acknowledged partial support from the Broad Institute for the work reported in the paper . The Broad Institute in fact did not support any of that work , and the acknowledgment of its support was mistaken . Editor’s note : all of the authors , with the exception of Luk Van Parijs , agree with the wording of this Corrigendum . © 2007 N a t u r e P ub li s h i ng G r oup h tt p : / / ww w . n a t u r e . c o m / n a t u r e g e n e t i cs
