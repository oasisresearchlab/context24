Braun - Dullaeus Abstract —Mechanotransduction represents an integral part of vascular homeostasis and contributes to vascular lesion formation . Previously , we demonstrated a mechanosensitive activation of phosphoinositide 3 - kinase ( PI3 - K ) / protein kinase B ( Akt ) resulting in p27 Kip1 transcriptional downregulation and cell cycle entry of vascular smooth muscle cells ( VSMC ) . In this study , we further elucidated the signaling from outside - in toward PI3 - K / Akt in vitro and in an in vivo model of elevated tensile force . When VSMC were subjected to cyclic stretch ( 0 . 5 Hz at 125 % resting length ) , PI3 - K , Akt , and Src kinases were found activated . Disrupting caveolar structures with (cid:1) - cyclodextrin or transfection of VSMC with caveolin - 1 antisense oligonucleotides ( ODN ) prevented PI3 - K and Akt activation and cell cycle entry . Furthermore , PI3 - K and Akt were resistant to activation when Src kinases were inhibited pharmacologically or by overexpression of a kinase - dead c - Src mutant . (cid:2) V (cid:1) 3 integrins were identified to colocalize with PI3 - K / caveolin - 1 complexes , and blockade of (cid:2) V (cid:1) 3 integrins prevented Akt activation . The central role of caveolin - 1 in mechanotrans - duction was further examined in an in vivo model of elevated tensile force . Interposition of wild - type ( WT ) jugular veins into WT carotid arteries resulted in a rapid Akt activation within the veins that was almost abolished when veins of caveolin - 1 knockout ( KO ) mice were used . Furthermore , late neointima formation within the KO veins was significantly reduced . Our study provides evidence that PI3 - K / Akt is critically involved in mechanotransduction of VSMC in vitro and within the vasculature in vivo . Furthermore , caveolin - 1 is essential for the integrin - mediated activation of PI3 - K / Akt . ( Circ Res . 2005 ; 96 : 635 - 642 . ) Key Words : remodeling (cid:1) muscle , smooth (cid:1) signal transduction (cid:1) stress (cid:1) vasculature I t is currently recognized that the machinery governing the cell cycle regulates multiple cellular functions in the cardiovascular system , thereby maintaining the homeostasis of the vasculature and allowing its adaptation to acute and chronic changes . Besides organizing cellular proliferation , the cell cycle is involved in migration , apoptosis , and hypertrophy . 1 One of the major constituents of the blood vessel wall responsible for the maintenance of vessel structures and functions are vascular smooth muscle cells ( VSMCs ) . In the vasculature , VSMCs are constantly exposed to alternating mechanical forces . Under normal tensile stress , VSMCs are relatively insensitive to mitogens . During altered mechanical stress ( eg , high blood pressure ) , however , VSMCs upregulate protein synthesis in response to growth factors , dedifferenti - ate , and increase their proliferative rate , resulting in medial hypertrophy and intimal hyperplasia . 2 Whereas the com - monly accepted “response to injury” hypothesis suggests that growth factors are locally released , thereby initiating cell cycle entry and progression of vascular cells , the signaling pathways arising solely from mechanical force have just partially come to light . 3 Recently , we demonstrated that the earliest cell cycle events can occur in a mechanosensitive fashion independently of newly released or synthesized growth factors but that they are dependent on an intact integrin signaling . 4 Besides mediating cell adhesion , integrins transmit extra - cellular stimuli into intracellular signaling events . 5 Thus , integrins mediate VSMC dedifferentiation , migration , prolif - eration , and apoptosis . 6 Signaling through integrins requires physical interaction with other membrane proteins and sub - sequent association with signal transduction proteins of the cytoplasm . Caveolin - 1 functions as a membrane adaptor . For example , caveolin - 1 links the integrin (cid:2) - subunit to the c - Src kinase pathway and subsequently to the mitogen - activated protein kinase pathway ( MAPK ) to promote cell cycle pro - gression . 7 Another pathway critical for VSMC proliferation consists of the phosphoinositide 3 - kinase ( PI3 - K ) / protein ki - Original received September 18 , 2003 ; resubmission received October 13 , 2004 ; revised resubmission received February 15 , 2005 ; accepted February 16 , 2005 .

In this way , p27 Kip1 may serve as a differential sensor for growth factor – and mechanically in - duced cell cycle entry in VSMCs . In the present study , we further elucidated the integrin / adaptor protein interactions resulting in growth factor – independent PI3 - K / Akt activation and subsequent cell cycle entry . We present evidence that the structural protein caveolin - 1 is essential for integrin - mediated PI3 - K / Akt activation during cyclic stretch of VSMCs in vitro and in an in vivo model of elevated tensile force . In our in vitro model , mechanical force induces the formation of functional signaling complexes composed of (cid:2) V (cid:1) 3 integrins , caveolin - 1 , PI3 - K / Akt , and the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase c - Src , resulting in PI3 - K / Akt activation and thereby facilitat - ing a mechanosentive proliferative response of VSMCs . Materials and Methods Cell Culture , Stretch Apparatus , and Experimental Conditions Primary cultures of VSMCs were initiated by enzymatic dissociation from the aorta of 7 - to 8 - week - old male Sprague - Dawley rats ( Charles River Breeding Laboratories , Kingston , NY ) . 10 The cells were seeded ( (cid:1) 10 000 cells / cm 2 ) onto 6 - well fibronectin - coated FlexI plates ( Flexcell ) . Studies were conducted on VSMCs ( passages 7 to 12 ) after achieving confluence in 10 % FCS / DMEM / F12 , followed by serum withdrawal for 2 days to achieve quiescence . On the day of the experiment , fresh serum - free medium was substituted and uniaxial cyclic stretch was applied with a flexercell apparatus ( 125 % resting length , 0 . 5 Hz ) in a tissue culture incubator . Immunocytochemistry VSMCs were grown on fibronectin - coated flexercell wells . Quies - cent or stretched ( 30 minutes ) cells were fixed for 10 minutes in ice - cold acetone . Cells were covered for 20 minutes with 10 % normal goat serum , followed by incubation with rabbit anti - caveolin - 1 ( 1 : 100 ) and mouse anti PI3 - K ( p85 , 1 : 50 ) for 1 hour in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) containing 0 . 1 % bovine serum albumin . After two washing steps ( 10 minutes in PBS ) , cells were incubated with secondary antibodies for 40 minutes : donkey anti - rabbit IgG conjugated to FITC ( 1 : 200 ) and goat anti - mouse IgG conjugated to Alexa Fluor 546 ( 1 : 200 ) . After washing , cells were mounted in Vectashield mounting medium H - 1000 containing DAPI ( 5 (cid:3) g / mL , Linaris ) and evaluated using an epifluorescence micro - scope ( DMRB , Leica ) . Negative controls were performed using only the secondary antibody . Preparation of Cellular Lysates and Immunoblot Analysis Specific protein content in cell lysates was analyzed by immunoblot as previously described . 11 Briefly , cell lysis buffer contained 50 mmol / L HEPES pH 7 . 4 , 100 mmol / L NaCl , 50 mmol / L NaF , 5 mmol / L glycerophosphate , 2 mmol / L EDTA , 2 mmol / L EGTA , 1 mmol / L vanadat , 0 . 5 % octyglucopyranoside , PMSF 100 (cid:3) g / mL , aprotinin 30 (cid:3) L / mL , leupeptin 1 ng / mL , and okadaic acid 10 (cid:3) mol / L . Lysate proteins ( 20 (cid:3) g ) were run on a polyacrylamide gel and blotted onto nitrocellulose ( Hybond - ECL , Amersham ) . After blocking , blots were incubated with primary antibody for 1 hour at room temperature . Specific proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence ( ECL (cid:2) , Amersham ) after labeling with horse - radish peroxidase - labeled secondary antibody ( 1 : 2000 for 1 hour ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Flow Cytometry Cells were harvested by trypsinization , fixed overnight with 75 % methanol , washed , and incubated with 100 (cid:3) g / mL RNase ( Oncogene Research Products ) and 10 (cid:3) g / mL propidium iodide in PBS for 1 hour at 37°C . Samples were analyzed for DNA content using a high - speed cell sorter ( EPICs Altra , Beckman Coulter ) . Data were computer - analyzed with commercially available software ( Multi - cycle , Phoenix Flow Systems ) . Mice and Vein Graft Procedure Caveolin - 1 (cid:3) / (cid:3) mice were provided by M . Drab , Max Planck Institute for Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics , Dresden , Germany . All animal experiments were performed according to protocols approved by the Institutional Committee for Use and Care of Laboratory Animals ( Giessen University ) . The vein graft procedure has been described previously . 12 Briefly , mice were anesthetized with keta - mine ( 50 mg / kg body weight , IP ) . The jugular vein was harvested from the donor . In the recipient , the left common carotid artery was mobilized from proximal to the distal bifurcation , cut in the middle , and a cuff ( 0 . 63 mm outside diameter and 0 . 5 mm inside diameter , Portex LTD ) placed at each end . At each end , the artery was turned inside out over the cuff and ligated . The vein segment was grafted between the two ends of the carotid artery by sleeving the ends of the vein over the artery - cuff and ligating them together with an 8 - 0 suture . For Western blot experiments , vein grafts were perfused with PBS , excised immediately , and snap - frozen in liquid nitrogen until further use . Statistical Analysis Data are given as mean (cid:4) SEM . Statistical analysis was performed by ANOVA . Post hoc analysis was performed by the method of Bonferroni . All experiments , including the immunoblots , were inde - pendently repeated at least three times .

Results Mechanical Strain Induces Colocalization of PI3 - K With Caveolin - 1 and Their Clustering at Focal Adhesion Sites Previously , we had demonstrated that stretch - induced cell cycle entry and progression can be prevented by pharmaco - logical inhibition of PI3 - K ( LY294002 and wortmannin ) or overexpression of a constitutive negative Akt , indicating a requirement for PI3 - K / Akt in mechanically induced prolifer - ation of VSMCs . 4 In the present examination of cellular distribution , it was found that in quiescent cells , PI3 - K had a homogeneous cytosolic distribution and that caveolin - 1 was distributed at the cell surface in a diffuse , punctuate manner ( Figure 1A and 1B ) . After 15 minutes of cyclic stretch , PI3 - K and caveolin - 1 accumulated in clusters at the cell membrane . Double - staining suggested their colocalization ( Figure 1A and 1B ) . The PI3 - K / caveolin - 1 complexes seemed to be located at focal adhesion sites as implicated by their colocalization with vinculin ( shown for caveolin - 1 ; Figure 1A and 1B ) . 636 Circulation Research April 1 , 2005 by gu e s t on J u l y 10 , 2017 h tt p : / / c i r c r e s . a h a j ou r n a l s . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m Mechanosensitive Activation of PI3 - K / Akt Requires Intact Caveolar Structures and Caveolin - 1 We examined whether caveolar structures are required for the mechanosensitive activation of PI3 - K / Akt . Addition of (cid:1) - cyclodextrin , which depletes cholesterol from caveolae and thereby disrupts caveolar structures , was able to prevent stretch - induced assembly of PI3 - K with Akt and caveolin - 1 ( Figure 2A ) . Furthermore , it prevented activa - tion of PI3 - K and phosphorylation of Akt ( Figure 2B and Figure 2D ) . Because caveolin - 1 essentially contributes to caveolae formation and serves as an adaptor molecule for multiple cell membrane molecules , involvement of caveolin - 1 in stretch - induced PI3 - K activation and Akt phosphorylation was examined . Incubation of cells with caveolin - 1 antisense oligonucleotides ( cav - 1 AS ODN ) but not control ( reverse ) ODN resulted in an almost complete abolition of caveolin - 1 expression within 24 hours ( Figure 2C ) . Incubation with cav - 1 AS ODN 24 hours before stretch was able to completely prevent phosphorylation and , thereby , activation of Akt ( Figure 2D ) . Activation of PI3 - K / Akt is essential for stretch - induced cell - cycle entry and subsequent proliferation of VSMCs . 4 Consistent with experiments described earlier demonstrat - ing a caveolin - 1 – dependent activation of PI3 - K / Akt dur - ing cyclic stretch , caveolin - 1 AS ODN , but not control ODN , almost completely prevented stretch - induced prolif - eration ( Figure 3A ) . In contrast , caveolin - 1 AS ODN did not significantly alter the proliferative response of VSMCs exposed to serum stimulation ( 10 % FCS ; Figure 3B ) . Our data indicate that caveolin - 1 mediates mechanosensitive cell cycle entry and progression of VSMCs via PI3 - K / Akt . To further substantiate the results seen by transient AS ODN - mediated caveolin - 1 disruption , we isolated VSMCs from aortas of caveolin - 1 (cid:3) / (cid:3) mice ( cav - 1 (cid:3) / (cid:3) ) . As demon - strated in rat VSMCs , exposure of mouse wild - type ( WT ) VSMCs to cyclic stretch for 15 minutes induced a profound activation of Akt as well as p42 / 44 ( Erk ) mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) ( Figure 3C ) . This activation was comparable to the activation seen in cells exposed to 10 % FCS in the absence of cyclic stretch . Akt activation was Figure 2 . Activation of PI3 - K / Akt requires intact caveolar struc - tures and caveolin - 1 . A , VSMCs were exposed to cyclic stretch for 15 minutes . Cyclodextrin ( 10 mmol / L ) was added 30 minutes before stretch . PI3 - K ( p85 ) was precipitated in lysates of stretched cells and control cells , and associated ( coimmunopre - cipitated ) proteins were determined by immunoblotting . B , Cells were exposed to cyclic stretch for 15 minutes . Cyclodextrin ( 10 mmol / L ) was added 30 minutes before stretch . Mitogen - free , quiescent cells served as a control .

Cdk4 served as a loading control . D , Cells were exposed to cyclic stretch for 15 minutes . Cyclodextrin ( 10 mmol / L ) was added 30 minutes before stretch . VSMCs were also pretreated using caveolin - 1 AS ODN , reverse AS ODN ( rev ODN ) as a control , or liposomes alone . Akt phosphorylation was determined by immu - noblotting . Cdk4 served as a control for equal protein loading . Figure 1 . Mechanical strain induces association of PI3 - K , PDK1 , and Akt with caveolin - 1 and their clustering at focal adhesion sites . VSMCs were held quiescent or were exposed to cyclic stretch for 15 minutes .

Although a moderate Akt activation was de - tected after addition of 10 % FCS to cav - 1 (cid:3) / (cid:3) VSMCs , this activation was markedly impaired , suggesting that caveolin - 1 also facilitates growth factor – induced Akt activation . Similarly , Erk activation was impaired in cav - 1 (cid:3) / (cid:3) cells exposed to cyclic stretch , suggesting that caveolin - 1 is also essential for mechanosensitive Erk activation . However , Erk was still sensitive to serum stimulation in these cells . Twenty four hours of cyclic stretch did not trigger prolif - eration of cav - 1 (cid:3) / (cid:3) cells but of WT cells ( 15 (cid:4) 1 . 7 versus 28 (cid:4) 2 . 4 of cells in S / G2 - phase , respectively ; n (cid:7) 3 , P (cid:8) 0 . 01 ; Figure 3D ) . However , the proliferative response to 10 % FCS was not impaired in cav - 1 (cid:3) / (cid:3) VSMCs compared with their WT littermates ( 36 . 5 (cid:4) 3 . 5 versus 32 . 1 (cid:4) 2 . 8 , cells in S / G2 - phase ; n (cid:7) 3 , P (cid:7) NS ; Figure 3D ) . Notably , the basal prolifer - ative rate of cav - 1 (cid:3) / (cid:3) cells was determined to be higher than that of WT cells ( n (cid:7) 3 , P (cid:8) 0 . 01 , Figure 3D ) . Cyclic Stretch Causes Activation of Src Family Kinases , Their Association With Caveolin - 1 and PI3 - K ( p85 ) , and Activation of PI3 - K / Akt Src nonreceptor protein tyrosine family kinases have been demonstrated to associate with caveolin - 1 . 13 Src family ki - nases ( SFKs ) have also been shown to be involved in Akt activation . 14 We examined whether the SFK c - Src , Fyn , or c - Yes associate with caveolin - 1 and PI3 - K ( p85 ) under conditions of cyclic stretch . Lysates of rat VSMCs stretched for 5 minutes were immunoprecipitated with anti – c - Src , anti - Fyn , or anti – c - Yes , and an immunoblot was performed for caveolin - 1 . Cyclic stretch rapidly stimulated caveolin - 1 / Fyn , caveolin - 1 / c - Src , and caveolin - 1 / c - Yes association in VSMCs ( Figure 4A ) . Furthermore , cyclic stretch resulted in activation of Fyn , c - Src , and c - Yes as examined by their autophosphorylation ( Figure 4B ) . SFK activation was rapid and transient , as peak activity levels were already reached after 30 minutes of cyclic stretch ( data not shown ) . As expected , stretch - induced activation of SFKs was prevented by the specific inhibitor , PP1 . In addition , cyclic stretch resulted in a significant ( 4 . 5 - fold ) increase of c - Src tyrosine kinase activity ( Figure 4C , n (cid:7) 3 , * P (cid:8) 0 . 01 ) . Figure 4 . Cyclic stretch causes association of Src family kinase ( SFK ) with caveolin - 1 and results in SFK activation . A , VSMCs were exposed to cyclic stretch for 5 minutes .

SFK c - Src , Yes , and Fyn were immunoprecipitated in lysates of stretched cells and quiescent cells or cells pretreated with the speciﬁc inhibitor PP1 ( 10 (cid:3) mol / L ) before stretch .

After ﬁxation and propidium iodide staining , cell cycle distribution was determined by FACS analysis .

Caveolin - 1 expression was observed in wild - type cells only . PanAkt expres - sion served as a loading control .

Previously , we had shown that Akt phosphorylation , under conditions of cyclic stretch , was strictly dependent on PI3 - K activation because PI3 - K inhibition ( LY294002 and Wortmannin ) completely prevented Akt phos - phorylation . 4 The addition of PP1 , a specific inhibitor of the Src kinase family , 15 not only prevented PI3 - K activa - tion ( Figure 5A ) but was also able to completely prevent stretch - induced Akt phosphorylation ( Figure 5B ) , indicat - ing that the SFK acts upstream of PI3 - K . To further investigate the role of SFKs in PI3 - K / Akt activation and to specifically probe for the involvement of c - Src in stretch - induced PI3 - K activation , we transiently overexpressed a kinase - inactive mutant of c - Src [ c - Src ( K297R ) ] in rat VSMCs . Overexpression of c - Src ( K297R ) but not of a control vector expressing green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) prevented stretch - induced Akt activation ( Figure 5C ) . The cells had been cotransfected and MACS - sorted before Western blotting to ensure analysis of a highly enriched , positively transfected cell population ex - pressing the inactive c - Src mutant . Integrin (cid:1) V (cid:2) 3 Mediates Stretch - Induced PI3 - K / Akt Activation We previously demonstrated that mechanosensitive PI3 - K activation is dependent on an intact integrin / extracellular matrix interaction , 4 and (cid:2) V (cid:1) 3 integrins have been shown to mediate stretch - induced VSMC proliferation . 16 Therefore , experiments were performed to elucidate the role of specific integrins , in particular (cid:2) V (cid:1) 3 integrins , in mechanosensitive PI3 - K activation . Lysates of cells stretched for 10 minutes were immunoprecipitated with anti – PI3 - K ( p85 ) , and immu - noblots were performed for (cid:2) V and (cid:1) 3 integrins . Both integrin types were found to be associated with PI3 - K ( p85 ) , indicat - ing that (cid:2) V or (cid:1) 3 integrins play a role in mechanically induced PI3 - K / Akt activation ( Figure 6A ) . To further examine (cid:2) V (cid:1) 3 integrin involvement in PI3 - K / Akt activation , we preincu - bated cells with a specific (cid:2) V (cid:1) 3 - integrin inhibitor ( XJ735 ) . Preincubation of cells with XJ735 but not with a control peptide prevented stretch - induced Akt activation ( Figure 6B ) , indicating that stretch - induced PI3 - K activation is mediated to a large extent by (cid:2) V (cid:1) 3 integrins . Mechanosensitive Akt Activation and Neointima Formation Is Impaired in Caveolin - 1 (cid:3) / (cid:3) Mice To validate the role of caveolin - 1 in mechanical strain – induced signal transduction and proliferation in vivo , jugular vein segments from cav - 1 (cid:3) / (cid:3) mice were exposed to arterial pressure by transplantation into the mouse common carotid artery of C57 / BL6J WT recipients . After exposure of the vein grafts to arterial pressure for 15 minutes , activation ( phos - phorylation ) of Akt and Erk was determined by immunoblot - ting . The results indicate that Akt activation was prevented in the veins of cav - 1 (cid:3) / (cid:3) mice ( Figure 7A ) . Similarly , Erk activation was impaired in the veins of cav - 1 (cid:3) / (cid:3) mice com - pared with the veins of WT controls ( Figure 7A ) . To evaluate if impaired force - induced Akt ( and Erk ) activation of cav - 1 (cid:3) / (cid:3) VSMCs in vitro and in vivo finds a correlate in an altered neointima formation , vein segments were interposed into the arterial system for 6 weeks . Whereas veins of WT mice developed severe neointimal lesions , neointima formation was significantly reduced in veins de - rived from cav - 1 (cid:3) / (cid:3) mice ( 0 . 12 (cid:4) 0 . 03 versus 0 . 19 (cid:4) 0 . 03 mm 2 , respectively ; n (cid:7) 8 , P (cid:8) 0 . 01 ; Figure 7B and 7C ) . Discussion Mechanotransduction plays a critical role in vascular ho - meostasis . Whereas physiologically moderate cyclic stretch seems essential for maintaining vessel wall structure and for Figure 5 . c - Src mediates stretch - induced PI3 - K / Akt activation .

PP1 ( 10 (cid:3) mol / L ) was added 30 minutes before stretch . Akt phosphorylation was determined by immunoblotting . Cdk4 served as a control for equal protein loading . C , Cells were tranfected with a kinase - inactive c - Src [ c - Src ( (cid:3) ) ] or a control vector expressing only GFP 24 hours before positive selection by MACS . Positively trans - fected cells were then plated and exposed to 15 minutes of cyclic stretch .

Recently , we were able to demonstrate that mechanical force activates PI3 - K / Akt signaling independent of growth factors . Akt in turn inactivates forkhead transcrip - tion factors , which are involved in p27 Kip1 gene transactiva - tion . Subsequent downregulation of p27 Kip1 resulted in cell cycle entry and progression of VSMCs . 4 In the present study , we were able to further characterize the components and mechanisms of VSMCs mechanosensing that initiate mechanically induced proliferation of VSMCs . We provide evidence that Src family kinases represent an important component of integrin - mediated PI3 - K / Akt signal - ing and that caveolin - 1 is required for efficient signaling by forming an active c - Src kinase / PI3 - K / Akt module . Moreover , we demonstrate the relevance of our findings in an in vivo model of enhanced tensile force . Interposing a vein of a cav - 1 (cid:3) / (cid:3) mouse into the carotid artery of a WT mouse allowed us to examine the effect of force on the cav - 1 (cid:3) / (cid:3) vasculature independent of systemic limitations inherent in caveolin - 1 gene - disrupted mice . In cav - 1 (cid:3) / (cid:3) veins , Akt acti - vation was completely abolished . Nevertheless , veins of cav - 1 (cid:3) / (cid:3) mice still developed a neointima , although to a significantly lesser extent . Previous studies and our in vitro data may explain the in vivo results : whereas Akt was unresponsive to both serum and mechanical stimulation when caveolin - 1 was deleted , exposure of these cells to serum mitogens still resulted in Erk activation . On the other hand , stretch - induced proliferation was completely prevented when VSMCs of cav - 1 (cid:3) / (cid:3) mice were used , whereas growth factor treatment still resulted in their cell cycle entry and progres - Figure 6 . Integrin (cid:2) V (cid:1) 3 mediates stretch - induced PI3 - K / Akt acti - vation . A , VSMCs were exposed to cyclic stretch for 15 min - utes . PI3 - K ( p85 ) was precipitated in lysates of stretched cells and quiescent cells . PI3 - K – associated ( coimmunoprecipitated ) integrin (cid:2) V and integrin (cid:1) 3 were determined by immunoblotting . B , Cells were exposed to cyclic stretch for 15 minutes after pre - incubation with the speciﬁc integrin (cid:2) V (cid:1) 3 inhibitor XJ735 or a control peptide ( GRGESP ) . Akt phosphorylation was determined by immunoblotting . PanAkt served as a control for equal protein loading . Figure 7 . Stretch - induced Akt activation and neointima forma - tion in vivo is dependent on caveolin - 1 . A , Jugular veins of wild - type C57 / BL6J mice ( WT ) or caveolin - 1 (cid:3) / (cid:3) mice were trans - planted into carotid arteries of WT mice . After 15 minutes of exposure to arterial perfusion , Akt and Erk activation were determined by immunoblotting of lysates of excised veins . Cdk4 served as a loading control . B and C , Jugular veins of WT mice or caveolin - 1 (cid:3) / (cid:3) mice were transplanted into carotid arteries of WT mice , and 6 weeks after transplantation , neointima forma - tion was quantiﬁed by morphometrical analysis ( n (cid:7) 8 , * P (cid:8) 0 . 01 , representative cross sections are shown ) . 640 Circulation Research April 1 , 2005 by gu e s t on J u l y 10 , 2017 h tt p : / / c i r c r e s . a h a j ou r n a l s . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m sion . This points toward Akt’s predominant role for mechan - ically triggered proliferation . Indeed , pharmacological inhi - bition of Erk during stretch did not impair the proliferative response of VSMCs in vitro . 4 Furthermore , our study also points toward a predominant role of caveolin - 1 for mechano - sensitive cell cycle entry and progression . Growth factor – induced proliferation , however , was not impaired when caveolin - 1 was disrupted , a finding previously described . 19 In vivo , the net effect of growth factors and mechanically triggered stimuli determine the amount of neointima formation . This may explain why late neointima formation was signifi - cantly reduced but not abolished in our model . Moreover , it may explain why another study that used instead an inflammatory model of neointima formation reported an increase of lesion size in cav - 1 (cid:3) / (cid:3) mice . 20 Obviously , more factors have to be consid - ered . In cav - 1 (cid:3) / (cid:3) mice , endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( eNOS ) is activated . 21 eNOS gene transfer has been shown to prevent neointima formation in denuded rat carotid arteries . 22 Therefore , augmented endothelial nitric oxide synthesis may be additionally responsible for reduced neointima formation in our in vivo model as well as reduced plaque formation in ApoE (cid:3) / (cid:3) mice interbred with cav - 1 (cid:3) / (cid:3) . 23 As mentioned earlier , other studies have demonstrated that signaling components within caveolae may be held inactive until their activation and release by appropriate external stimuli . The p42 / 44 ( Erk ) MAP kinase cascade has been shown to be predominantly negatively regulated by caveolin . 19 , 24 Moreover , mice lacking caveolin - 1 have defects in nitric oxide and calcium signaling , and their lungs display severe abnormalities caused by uncontrolled cell proliferation and fibrosis , 25 pointing toward the role of caveolin in inhibiting signaling pathways that regulate cellular proliferation in lung tissue . It is not yet clear , however , why hyperproliferative abnormalities were not found in other tissues that are normally rich in caveolin - 1 . This may be explained by studies demonstrating that caveolae can also stimulate signaling activity and proliferation . The association of caveolin - 1 with the integrin (cid:2) - subunit and the tyrosine kinase Fyn , for example , leads to activation of the Ras - Erk pathway and promotes cell cycle progression . 7 The PDGF and the insulin receptors also seem to initiate their signal transduction from caveolae . 26 Our data support the hypothesis that in the vascula - ture , which is constantly exposed to alternating mechanical force and different growth factors , a dual role of caveolin - 1 may contribute to a sensitive balance of anti - and pro - proliferative effects that allow the vessel to adapt to acute or chronic changes . Interestingly , a dual role of caveolin - 1 toward eNOS has recently been demonstrated : although caveolin - 1 repressed basal eNOS activity , it was crucial for agonist - ( vascular endothelial growth factor – ) induced eNOS activation . 27 In this study , we also demonstrate that cholesterol depletion of the plasma membrane by (cid:1) - cyclodextrin prevents PI3 - K / Akt acti - vation . Caveolae form from cholesterol - and sphingolipid - rich rafts in the membrane in a process that requires caveolin - 1 . Furthermore , the function of caveolae is dependent on a sufficient level of cholesterol in the plasma membrane , and caveolin - 1 is involved in maintaining caveolar cholesterol levels . 28 Consistent with our re - sults , reduction of plasma membrane cholesterol levels with cho - lesterol - binding agents has been shown to inhibit specific agonist - stimulated signaling pathways , eg , insulin - stimulated insulin receptor substrate - 1 phosphorylation 29 or shear stress , 30 and nerve growth factor – induced 31 and endothelin - 1 – induced 32 activation of the extracellular signal - regulated kinase , Erk . Although our data suggest that caveolin - 1 acts directly through protein - protein inter - actions , it may also operate indirectly by maintaining caveolar structure and integrity necessary for mechanosensitive proliferation through integrin / c - Src / PI3 - K / Akt interaction . Immunocytochemical staining of VSMCs indicates a force - dependent recruitment of PI3 - K and caveolin - 1 to focal adhesion sites , suggesting that PI3 - K plays a role in integrin - mediated cellular response to mechanical stimuli . It has been shown that integrins are , indeed , sequestered into caveolar microdomains of the plasma membrane , 7 , 33 implying a re - quirement of caveolar microdomains for integrating integrin - mediated mechanotransduction toward an intracellular signal . In VSMCs , the proliferative response to strain was abrogated by antibodies to both (cid:2) V and (cid:1) 3 integrins , but not (cid:1) 1 integrins . 16 , 34 In accordance with these findings , we find a dependency of tensile stress - mediated PI3 - K / Akt activation on (cid:2) V (cid:1) 3 integrins . Furthermore , Src family kinases are required for the force - dependent formation of focal adhesion complexes and strengthening of (cid:2) V (cid:1) 3 integrin - cytoskeleton connections . 35 In addition , an involvement of Src family kinases in PI3 - K and in Akt activation has been reported before . 36 In this study , we demonstrate that a pharmacological inhibitor of the Src kinase family tyrosine kinases ( PP1 ) prevents not only Akt activation and proliferation , but also PI3 - K activation , indicating that mechanosensitive c - Src kinase signaling lies upstream of PI3 - K . Our findings support the concept that c - Src is an additional , essential component for mechanosensitive PI3 - K activation . Mechanosensing of VSMCs via (cid:2) V (cid:1) 3 integrins / caveolin - 1 / c - Src kinase – dependent activation of PI3 - K / Akt signaling and subsequent cellular proliferation may play an important role in physiological vascular remodeling processes and the pathophysiology of vascular proliferative diseases . Our data further add to the understanding of mechanisms involved in vascular homeostasis and the pathophysiology of prolifera - tive disease processes and may have novel implications for the future design of therapeutic interventions .

Transfection Procedures and Magnetic - Activated Cell Sorting ( MACS ) For caveolin - 1 antisense oligonucleotide ( ODN ) experiments , phosphorothioate ODN were modified by the addition of a propinyl group to the pyrimidine base cytidine , which is thought to enhance base stacking for enhanced sense antisense interaction . The antisense ODN sequence used in the experiments was 5´ - ACCCCCAGACATGCTGGC - 3´ ( complementary to bases 23 - 40 of rat caveolin - 1 ; Z46614 ) ; the reverse ODN sequence was 5´ - CGGTCGTACAGACCCCCA - 3’ . For the lipofection procedure , 20 nmol / l ODN were mixed with Fugene ( Roche , Mannheim , Germany ) in serum - free medium ( Opti - MEM , GIBCO BRL , 2004 / 095505 / R1 Karlsruhe , Germany ) and incubated for 10 min . VSMC were rinsed once with PBS and the ODN - Fugene solution was added to the cells in a serum - free medium . Cells were then incubated for 24 h before the experiment was performed as indicated . Subsequently , the cells were harvested by trypsinization for FACS analysis or Western blotting . FITC - labeled ODN showed nuclear uptake in up to 90 % of cells using this technique ( data not shown ) . For MACS , cells were co - transfected with equimolar amounts of pMACS . K k - II and the expression plasmid in a 1 : 3 ratio as indicated . Transfection was carried out using Fugene ( Roche , Mannheim , Germany ) . For a 35 - mm dish , 6 µ l liposomes were added to 100 µ l Opti - MEM ( GIBCO BRL , Karlsruhe , Germany ) and mixed with 2 µ g vector DNA before adding the mixture to the cells in a serum - free medium . After 4 h , medium was withdrawn and fresh medium containing 10 % FCS was added . Transfection efficiency was 20 - 30 % . After 24 h , transfected cells were trypsinized and magnetically labeled using MACSelect K k - II MicroBeads ( Miltenyi Biotec , Bergisch Gladbach , Germany ) .

Lysate samples containing 250 µg of protein were pre - cleared with normal rabbit immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) bound to protein G Dynabeads ® before incubation with 1 µ g of anti - Fyn , anti - c - Src , or anti - Yes antibody for 2 h . Magnetic separation was achieved using protein G Dynabeads ® .

The reaction was terminated by addition of Laemmli buffer and subsequent boiling . After electrophoresis , gels were air - dried and subjected to autoradiography . For relative quantification of c - Src tyrosine kinase activity , cells were lysed in RIPA buffer and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti - c - Src antibody as described above . Activity of c - Src kinase was determined by a non - radioactive tyrosine kinase assay kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol ( Chemicon , Harrow , UK ) . Relative changes in c - Src activity ( OD 450 ) were displayed as means ± s . e . m .

Interposed vessels were harvested by cutting the grafted segments from the native vessels at the cuff end . Vessel samples were fixed with 4 % 2004 / 095505 / R1 phosphate - buffered formaldehyde at 4 °C for 24 h . The grafts were embedded in tissue - tec ( Miles Laboratories , Naperville , IL ) and processed by routine histology . Three sections ( 4 µm ) per graft were stained with hematoxylin and eosin ( HE ) for histological evaluation and quantification of neointimal area with KS300 software ( Carl Zeiss , Hallbergmoos , Germany ) . 2004 / 095505 / R1 Online Data Supplements : Materials and Methods Reagents The following antibodies were used : rabbit anti - phospho - Akt ( ser473 , pAkt ) ( New England Biolabs , Frankfurt , Germany ) , sheep anti - panAkt1 ( Upstate Biotech , Waltham , Massachusetts ) , rabbit anti - caveolin - 1 , rabbit anti - c - Src , mouse anti - Fyn , rabbit anti - c - Yes , rabbit anti - integrin α V , rabbit anti - integrin β 3 , mouse anti - Cdk4 , rabbit anti - vinculin ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , California , USA ) , mouse anti - PI3 - K ( p85 ) ( BD Biosciences , Erembodegem , Belgium ) .

For the lipofection procedure , 20 nmol / l ODN were mixed with Fugene ( Roche , Mannheim , Germany ) in serum - free medium ( Opti - MEM , GIBCO BRL , 2004 / 095505 / R1 Karlsruhe , Germany ) and incubated for 10 min . VSMC were rinsed once with PBS and the ODN - Fugene solution was added to the cells in a serum - free medium . Cells were then incubated for 24 h before the experiment was performed as indicated . Subsequently , the cells were harvested by trypsinization for FACS analysis or Western blotting . FITC - labeled ODN showed nuclear uptake in up to 90 % of cells using this technique ( data not shown ) . For MACS , cells were co - transfected with equimolar amounts of pMACS . K k - II and the expression plasmid in a 1 : 3 ratio as indicated . Transfection was carried out using Fugene ( Roche , Mannheim , Germany ) . For a 35 - mm dish , 6 µ l liposomes were added to 100 µ l Opti - MEM ( GIBCO BRL , Karlsruhe , Germany ) and mixed with 2 µ g vector DNA before adding the mixture to the cells in a serum - free medium . After 4 h , medium was withdrawn and fresh medium containing 10 % FCS was added . Transfection efficiency was 20 - 30 % . After 24 h , transfected cells were trypsinized and magnetically labeled using MACSelect K k - II MicroBeads ( Miltenyi Biotec , Bergisch Gladbach , Germany ) . Transfected ( K k - II positive ) cells were then separated on MS + / RS + separation columns ( Miltenyi Biotec ) and subsequently replated on flexercell - plates . For analysis , cells were lysed in the appropriate buffer . Positively selected cells were > 85 % positive for K k - II expression . Phosphoinositide 3 - Kinase Assay Cells were washed and lysed as described above . The supernatant was collected and approximately 500 µg of soluble proteins were subjected to immunoprecipitation with the indicated antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C . The immunocomplexes were harvested by magnetic separation using protein G Dynabeads ® ( Dynal Biotech , Hamburg , Germany ) , washed twice in lysis buffer , once in kinase buffer ( 20 mmol / l Tris pH 7 . 4 , 100 mmol / l NaCl , 0 . 5 mmol / l EDTA ) , and incubated with 15 µg of phosphatidylinositol ( Sigma ) . The assay was started by adding 5 µCi of [ α - 32 P ] ATP , 20 µmol / l ATP , and 20 mmol / l MgCl 2 for 20 min . The reaction was terminated after 20 min by addition of chloroform - methanol - 11 . 6 mol / l HCl ( 100 : 200 : 2 ) , 2004 / 095505 / R1 after which the lipids were extracted by chloroform : methanol ( 1 : 1 ) and fractioned by thin - layer chromatography in chloroform - methanol - water - ammoniumhydroxide ( 43 : 30 : 7 : 5 ) . The thin - layer chromatography plate was then air - dried and subjected to autoradiography . Src Family Kinase ( SFK ) Kinase Assay Cells were lysed as described above . Lysate samples containing 250 µg of protein were pre - cleared with normal rabbit immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) bound to protein G Dynabeads ® before incubation with 1 µ g of anti - Fyn , anti - c - Src , or anti - Yes antibody for 2 h . Magnetic separation was achieved using protein G Dynabeads ® . Immune complexes were washed 4 times with lysis buffer , and twice with kinase buffer ( 50 mmol / l HEPES [ pH 7 . 4 ] , 10 mmol / l MnCl 2 , 1 mmol / l dithiothreitol ) , re - suspended in kinase buffer containing 10 µCi of [ α - 32 P ] ATP and 25 µmol / l ATP , and incubated for 15 min at 30 °C . The reaction was terminated by addition of Laemmli buffer and subsequent boiling . After electrophoresis , gels were air - dried and subjected to autoradiography . For relative quantification of c - Src tyrosine kinase activity , cells were lysed in RIPA buffer and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti - c - Src antibody as described above . Activity of c - Src kinase was determined by a non - radioactive tyrosine kinase assay kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol ( Chemicon , Harrow , UK ) . Relative changes in c - Src activity ( OD 450 ) were displayed as means ± s . e . m . Histology and Morphometry Mice were anesthetized , perfused with 0 . 9 % NaCl solution via cardiac puncture into the left ventricle for 2 min and subsequently perfusion - fixed with 4 % phosphate - buffered formaldehyde ( pH 7 . 2 ) for 5 min . Interposed vessels were harvested by cutting the grafted segments from the native vessels at the cuff end . Vessel samples were fixed with 4 % 2004 / 095505 / R1 phosphate - buffered formaldehyde at 4 °C for 24 h . The grafts were embedded in tissue - tec ( Miles Laboratories , Naperville , IL ) and processed by routine histology . Three sections ( 4 µm ) per graft were stained with hematoxylin and eosin ( HE ) for histological evaluation and quantification of neointimal area with KS300 software ( Carl Zeiss , Hallbergmoos , Germany ) .
