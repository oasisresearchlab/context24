Government outcomes are the results , impacts or consequences of actions by the Government on the Australian community . Agencies are required to identify the output groups that demonstrate their contribution to Government outcomes over the coming year . This section summarises output groups , specifying the performance indicators and targets used to assess and monitor the performance of the AIHW in achieving Government outcomes . Outcome 1 – Better Health and Well - Being for Australians through Better Health and Welfare Statistics and Information 2 . 1 : S UMMARY OF O UTCOME , A GENCY R ESOURCING , O UTPUTS AND P ERFORMANCE I NFORMATION Outcome Summary The Australian Government places a high priority on sound , evidence - based policy and programs . As an Australian national agency dedicated to health and welfare information and statistics , the AIHW plays a key role in the development of the evidence - base for the health , housing and community services sectors . The AIHW works with the Australian and State and Territory governments to prepare and publish high quality , consistent information and statistics . Statistics are produced on areas such as : population health ; health services ; mental health and disability services ; Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health and welfare ; community services , including those for children and aged care ; drug and alcohol use and services ; and on housing and homelessness . Key Strategic Directions • Assist in the Government’s reform agenda by working with all stakeholders to ensure more consistent data is available . • Strengthen the policy relevance of the AIHW evidence - base through stronger stakeholder engagement . • Capitalise on the new information environment to maintain and enhance the quality of Australia’s health and welfare statistics . • Enhance data access , while protecting privacy . • Improve communication of key messages in information and statistics . 260 AIHW – Agency Budget Statements – Outcomes Major Activities Assisting the Reform Agenda The AIHW will work with all governments and other stakeholders to ensure there is the highest quality consistent data and information available to underpin the reform agenda in health and ageing as well as in other areas where the AIHW collects and analyses administrative data , including , housing , homelessness , disability and child protection . A I H W AIHW expertise in relation to health data will be applied to the development of performance indicators and used to ensure objective measurement of performance as well as providing a reliable evidence - base for policy reform . In some cases this may involve developing new data items for collection across states and territories , and ensuring that consistent definitions are applied . The AIHW will continue to add value by its informed analysis of the data to highlight patterns of service use and trends in health that will guide reform initiatives . Strengthening Policy Relevance As an independent statutory authority within the Health and Ageing Portfolio , the AIHW places a high priority on the development of relevant and timely information as an evidence - base for policy development . This helps to ensure that policies and programs are based on accurate , up - to - date information . Over the next four years , the AIHW , on behalf of the Australian Government , will develop and report on national indicators for safety and quality in health care in association with the Australian Commission for Safety and Quality in Health Care , and in areas as diverse as child health and well - being , juvenile justice , chronic disease and housing assistance . In addition , the AIHW will develop data to enhance the existing information collections in relation to medical indemnity and the health labour force , and child protection services . In conjunction with relevant national committees and jurisdictions , the AIHW will : explore the feasibility of implementing a national information collection in relation to child care and preschool services ; scope the development of a national information collection for family treatment and support services provided in the context of child protection ; and develop a tool to measure high and complex needs ( including for mental health services ) among homeless people seeking supported accommodation assistance . In 2008 - 09 , the AIHW will contribute data and analytical services to support the new national agreements being negotiated in the areas of health care funding , housing assistance and disability services . Nationally consistent data and analysis will help to ensure effective monitoring of the performance improvement objectives in national agreements . In line with the Australian Government’s priority of tackling the impact of cancer on the health and well - being of Australians , the AIHW will also work closely with peak bodies responsible for cancer control to provide data on cancer prevalence and survival rates , and to monitor cancer screening programs . Capitalising on the New Information Environment The Australian Government supports the collection of meaningful national statistics on the health and well - being of Australians , and on the health and welfare services they receive . The AIHW will continue to support the production of national data standards , data sets and metadata , and make these standards and metadata freely available through the internet . 261 AIHW – Agency Budget Statements – Outcomes The AIHW has a leadership role in ensuring statistical reporting functions in the health and welfare sector continue . The Institute will , where possible , work to improve statistical reporting , through changes to the information environment over coming years . Specific developments include e - Health , revisions of international classifications , development and uptake of terminologies , emerging data sources , and changed regulatory approaches , especially in the field of privacy . The AIHW contributes to maintaining the system of national health and welfare statistics through its input to data standards , metadata , terminologies and classifications . This work is critical to the provision of accurate and up - to - date information on the performance of the health and welfare systems . During 2008 - 09 , the AIHW will work with jurisdictions , national information committees , the National E - Health Transition Authority and other stakeholders to develop a framework for the statistical and analytical uses of e - Health data . The AIHW will ensure data standards for health and welfare statistics are maintained and are inclusive of developments in the broader national and international standards , and information management . Enhancing Data Access While Guarding Privacy In line with its legislative obligations and the Australian Government’s commitment to improve the use of data to inform policy directions , research and evaluation , the AIHW will work towards improving the use of its data while protecting Australians’ privacy . Over the next four years , the AIHW will ensure its custodial and ethics approval processes conform with national changes to human research ethics arrangements , national privacy legislation , policy directions for national health and welfare information , and any new custodial arrangements that might arise from national information agreements . In addition to publishing extensive summary statistics on health and welfare , the AIHW in 2008 - 09 will support ethical research by providing controlled access to data sets for specific research . Improving the Communication of Key Messages from Information and Statistics The AIHW will support the Australian Government’s objectives for evidence - based policy and community engagement , by producing plain English analyses of key health and welfare issues , easy to use statistical products and targeted education materials to improve community understanding and use of health and welfare statistics . In 2008 - 09 , the AIHW will introduce new methods for assessing the effectiveness of its reports and work with all governments to continuously improve the user - friendliness of AIHW reporting . As part of a wider social inclusion agenda , the AIHW will also work with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to improve feedback of relevant information to Indigenous communities and to improve communities’ statistical expertise and capacity to draw lessons from the data .

Departmental Resources Income Statement The AIHW is expecting to incur a small loss in 2007 - 08 . A loss of up to $ 730 , 000 has been approved by the Minister for Finance and Deregulation . The AIHW is budgeting to break - even in 2008 - 09 and in the following years . In order to achieve this , the AIHW will need to reduce its output as revenue is not expected to keep pace with increases in unit costs . Balance Sheet The AIHW’s cash balance is budgeted to slightly decrease in 2007 - 08 . Increases in the cash balance are estimated in subsequent years due to break - even budgets and capital expenditure being lower than depreciation . The value of land and buildings is expected to decrease due to the depreciation of fit - out costs over the term of the remaining lease . No other significant changes in balance sheet items are expected . 268 AIHW – Agency Budget Statements – Budgeted Financial Statements 3 . 3 : B UDGETED F INANCIAL S TATEMENTS T ABLES Table 3 . 3 . 1 : Budgeted Departmental Income Statement ( for the period ended 30 June ) Estimated Budget Forward Forward Forward actual estimate estimate estimate estimate 2007 -
