Here we show that the catalytic domain of FKBP36 binds to clathrin heavy chain ( CHC ) of clathrin . Despite wild - type FKBP36 not displaying PPIase activity , the introduction of the R81L substitution resulted in catalysis of prolyl isomerization , which is comparable to the regulated activity of FKBP38 . Furthermore , the TPR domain of FKBP36 interacts with Hsp72 . In fact , FKBP36 preferentially binds to Hsp72 among the members of the Hsp70 family and is thus the ﬁrst TPR - containing protein which discriminates between Hsp70 proteins . The clathrin - FKBP36 - Hsp72 complexes resulting from both identiﬁed interactions are bound to the matrices of clathrin - coated vesicles in spermatocytes , which indicates a possible role of FKBP36 and Hsp72 in the disassembly of clathrin coats . FKBP36 belongs to the peptidyl - prolyl cis / trans isomerase ( PPIase , 1 EC 5 . 2 . 1 . 8 ) family of FK506 - binding proteins ( FKBPs ) . The FKBP6 gene , which encodes FKBP36 , was shown to be involved in Williams - Beuren syndrome ( WBS ) ( 1 ) . FKBP6 belongs to a cluster of genes on chromosome 7 , which is completely or in part deleted in WBS patients . The dominant autosomal disorder WBS is characterized by supravalvular aortic stenosis , multiple peripheral pulmonary arterial stenoses , elﬁn face , mental and statural deﬁciency , characteristic dental malformation , and infantile hypercal - cemia ( 2 ) . The functional role of FKBP36 was studied previously by generating a FKBP36 - deﬁcient mouse ( 3 ) . The absence of FKBP36 in rodents resulted in aspermic males and the absence of normal pachytene spermatocytes . In contrast , female FKBP6 - / - mice are fertile and perfectly normal . Crackower et al . identiﬁed FKBP36 as a component of the synaptonemal complex , where this FKBP localizes to meiotic chromosome cores and regions of homologous chromosome synapsis . FKBP36 features two domains : ( i ) an N - terminal PPIase domain of the FKBP type and ( ii ) a C - terminal protein interaction domain containing three tetratrico peptide repeat ( TPR ) motifs . FKBPs usually catalyze the isomerization of peptide bonds preceding the amino acid proline in polypep - tides ( 4 ) . Moreover , these enzymes are characterized by their ability to bind tightly to the immunosuppressive drugs FK506 and rapamycin . The complexes of FKBPs and both low - molecular weight inhibitors are known to be involved in immunosuppression ( 5 ) . Several human FKBPs feature TPR motifs , which are degenerative sequences of 34 amino acids mediating inter - protein interactions ( 6 ) . Members of the FKBP family bind with their TPR domains to the C - terminal domains of heat shock proteins , such as Hsp90 ( 7 ) . These interactions are involved in multiprotein complex formation . Complexes between dimers of Hsp90 and either FKBP51 or FKBP52 have been reported to interact with client molecules , e . g . , steroid hormone receptors , to modify the activity , stability , or subcellular localization of the client proteins ( 7 ) . Within these complexes , the FKBPs interact with both the receptor and Hsp90 ( 8 ) . Here we show that the PPIase domain of FKBP36 interacts with clathrin , in a manner independent of the putative active site of FKBP36 . Additionally , a second interaction occurs between the FKBP36 TPR domain and the C - terminal domain of Hsp72 that leads to the formation of clathrin - FKBP36 - Hsp72 complexes . These complexes are present at the matrix of clathrin - coated vesicles of rat testes cells . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Sources of Enzymes . Human FKBP36 , human Hsp72 C10 , human Hsp71 C10 , and human Hsc70 C10 were employed ; human Hsp70L C10 and human Hsp90 C90 were recombi - nantly expressed by using a pET28a vector in Escherichia coli Rosetta cells . GST fusion FKBP36 variants were expressed using a pGEX4T1 vector in E . coli Rosetta cells . Rat and bovine testis CHC was puriﬁed from clathrin - coated vesicles .

The PPIase substrates ( Suc - Ala - Xaa - Pro - Phe - pNA ) were purchased from Bachem ( Heidelberg , Ger - many ) . FK506 was purchased from Calbiochem ( La Jolla , CA ) . PPIase Acti V ity Assay . Measurements were performed in 35 mM Hepes buffer ( pH 7 . 8 ) at 10 ° C in the protease - coupled assay ( 24 ) . Peptide substrates of the type succinyl - Ala - Xaa - Pro - Phe - 4 - nitroanilide , where Xaa represents a variable amino acid position N - terminal of the amino acid proline , were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide . A Hewlett - Packard 8452 diode array UV - vis spectrophotometer was used for monitoring the time course of the reaction . The obtained ﬁrst - order kinetics can be described by the rate equation V ) k obs [ cis ] ; k obs ) k 0 + k enz ( [ cis ] is the time - dependent concentration of the cis conformer , k 0 is the uncatalyzed , and k enz is the rate of the PPIase - catalyzed cis - trans interconversion of the substrate ) . The speciﬁcity constant k cat / K M was obtained from the equation k cat / K M ) ( k obs - k 0 ) / [ PPIase ] , assuming that the entire amount of the enzyme represents catalytically active molecules . Inhibition constants for the PPIase activity of FKBP36 and FKBP36 R81L by FK506 were determined by a competition assay using recombinant FKBP12 and the succinyl - AFPF - 4 - nitroanilide substrate ( 11 ) . Fluorescence Spectroscopy . Fluorescence spectra were recorded with a Perkin - Elmer FluoroMax2 ﬂuorescence spectrometer , using a 1 cm × 1 cm cuvette , an excitation wavelength of 280 nm , and excitation and emission slit widths of 5 and 3 nm , respectively . Protein samples were applied in 10 mM Tris buffer ( pH 7 . 5 ) . Protein Interaction Assays . For the GSH - Sepharose bind - ing assay , 30 µ L of GSH - Sepharose was pre - equilibrated in 25 mM Tris - HCl buffer ( pH 7 . 5 ) ( 150 mM NaCl and 1 mM DTT ) and saturated with GST or GST fusion proteins . Then the beads were washed twice with buffer B [ 25 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 150 mM NaCl , and 1 mM DTT ] and subsequently incubated for 2 h with 100 µ L of rat testes cytoplasm . In some experiments , 50 µ M Hsp90 C90 or 50 µ M Hsp72 C10 was added . Beads were centrifuged , washed three times , and mixed with an equal volume of Laemmli sample buffer . Samples were then subjected to 10 % SDS - PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting . Preparation of Subcellular Fractions . Subcellular fractions were prepared from either fresh or frozen rat testis . Rat testis were comminuted in 10 mM Hepes - NaOH ( pH 7 . 2 ) , 0 . 15 M NaCl , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT , 1 µ g / mL pepstatin A , 1 µ g / mL leupeptin , and 0 . 2 mM PMSF , followed by homogenization in a potter homogenizer . The crude extract was centrifuged for 10 min at 1000 g . The pellet was used for the preparation of nuclei ( 25 ) . The supernatant was centrifuged again for 15 min at 15000 g and for 45 min at 100000 g to prepare cytosol and membrane fractions . Membrane fractions were either extracted with 0 . 5 M Tris ( pH 7 . 5 ) to produce clathrin - coated vesicle components or with 1 % Triton . The membrane fraction was used for preparation of clathrin - coated vesicles ( 26 ) . Sucrose Gradient Centrifugation . For sedimentation analy - sis , clathrin - coated vesicles were subjected to a 0 to 60 % sucrose gradient centrifugation at 38000 rpm for 1 h at 4 ° C in an SW41 Ti rotor ( Beckman ) . Dissociation of Clathrin - Coated Vesicles and Preparation of CHC . For dissociation of coat proteins , crude clathrin - coated vesicles were resuspended in 0 . 5 M Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 4 ) . After incubation at room temperature for 30 min , these mixtures were centrifuged at 100000 g for 1 h . Samples of the supernatant and pellet were collected for protein analysis . For the preparation of puriﬁed CHC , the supernatant was subjected to gel ﬁltration in 0 . 5 M Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 4 ) ( Pharmacia S200 16 / 60 column ) . CHC - containing fractions were pooled and centrifuged at 100000 g for 1 h , and clathrin trimers were concentrated by addition of ammonium sulfate to 50 % saturation . RESULTS PPIase Acti V ity of FKBP36 . The multidomain FKBP36 was considered as FKBP on the basis of the similarity of its protein sequence to the sequences of several members of this PPIase family ( 1 ) . The N - terminal FKBP36 domain , comprising Gly 37 - Leu 143 , features 35 - 45 % identical resi - dues in the corresponding positions of the PPIase domains of other human FKBPs , including FKBP12 and FKBP52 . FKBP36 has a domain composition similar to those of FKBP37 . 7 , FKBP44 , and FKBP38 , the sequence of which is 45 % identical or similar with that of FKBP36 . Fourteen FKBP12 residues are involved in the formation of a hydrophobic pocket , which comprises the active site and mediates FK506 binding with high afﬁnity ( 9 , 10 ) . The PPIase domain of FKBP36 features eight conserved and two similar residues in the corresponding positions . Thus , the FKBP36 activity was tested in standard PPIase assays . However , neither the full - length protein nor the isolated PPIase domain of FKBP36 possessed catalytic activity in the presence of different peptide substrates ( data not shown ) . In addition , the capability of FKBP36 to bind to FK506 was analyzed using a FKBP competition assay ( 11 ) , but in analogy to the PPIase measurements , no FK506 binding of FKBP36 was observed . Further analysis of the FKBP36 residues corresponding to the active site residues of FKBP12 revealed a signiﬁcant difference between both proteins . Arg 81 of FKBP36 corre - sponds to Phe 46 of FKBP12 and probably protrudes with a positive charge in the largely hydrophobic cavity . This difference in wild - type ( WT ) FKBP36 might interfere with the binding of peptide substrates . Hence , we introduced the R81F substitution into FKBP36 to investigate the inﬂuence of the arginine side chain on FKBP36 activity , but in contrast to WT FKBP36 , the expression of this variant in E . coli resulted in an insoluble protein . However , the FKBP36 R81L variant carrying a hydrophobic leucine , as present in the corresponding position of FKBP25 , was expressed in the soluble fraction of E . coli and had a content of secondary structure elements and stability similar to those of the WT protein . Interestingly , the FKBP36 R81L variant exhibited catalytic activity in the PPIase assay , which revealed a k cat / K M value of ( 5 . 9 ( 0 . 2 ) × 10 3 M - 1 s - 1 for succinyl - Ala - Phe - Pro - Phe - p - nitroanilide substrate . This catalytic efﬁciency is compa - rable to the activity of the CaM - Ca 2 + - activated FKBP38 and signiﬁcantly lower than those of constitutively active FKBPs ( 11 , 12 ) . Interestingly , FKBP36 R81L activity was not inhibited by either the FKBP inhibitors FK506 and rapamycin or the cyclophilin inhibitor CsA ( data not shown ) . Measurements using different tetrapeptide substrates showed Clathrin - FKBP36 - Hsp72 Complex Biochemistry , Vol . 47 , No . 26 , 2008 6947 that the FKBP36 R81L variant has a unique substrate speciﬁcity , which is , however , similar to other FKBP substrate speciﬁcities ( Figure 1 ) . The FKBP36 R81L variant preferred the bulky hydrophobic residues leucine and phe - nylalanine and did not accept substrates with charged amino acid side chains , like glutamate and lysine , in the position N - terminal to proline . This substrate speciﬁcity excludes the possibility that the detected enzymatic activity is caused by an E . coli PPIase , which theoretically could be present as an impurity with the recombinant protein . These results demonstrate that the lack of catalytic activity of the FKBP36WT variant is based on the interference of the Arg 81 side chain with the binding of peptide substrates . Arg 81 is conserved in vertebrate orthologs of FKBP36 , but not found in the corresponding positions of other human FKBPs . Thus , a conserved participation of the FKBP36 active site in a signal transduction pathway and speciﬁc interaction partners of the catalytic domain of FKBP36 can be inferred . Furthermore , FK506 binding to FKBP36 is not prevented by Arg 81 , because the FKBP36 R81L variant is also not targeted by the low - molecular weight inhibitor , which adds to the unique features of the FKBP36 active site . The PPIase Domain of FKBP36 Interacts with CHC of Clathrin . To identify novel interaction partners of FKBP36 , a glutathione S - transferase fusion protein was coupled to a GSH afﬁnity matrix and applied to rat testes lysate . The experiments showed interactions between FKBP36 and a protein , which was identiﬁed by MALDI - TOF analysis as CHC . Thus , GST - bound FKBP36 was incubated with puri - ﬁed CHC to test the presence of direct interactions between both proteins . Figure 2A shows that CHC bound to the GST - FKBP36 fusion protein , whereas no interactions with only GST were observed . To further probe the interaction between clathrin and different FKBP36 variants , we determined whether clathrin interacts with the PPIase domain of FKBP36 . In fact , CHC bound to GST - fused full - length FKBP36 and the FKBP36 1 - 142 variant , whereas no binding to the GST - FKBP36 145 - 327 protein was observed ( Figure 2B ) . Moreover , the FKBP36 37 - 327 variant lacking the N - terminal extension bound to CHC in a manner comparable to that of the wild - type protein . Thus , CHC binds to the PPIase domain of FKBP36 , and the C - terminal TPR domain of FKBP36 is not involved in clathrin binding . Consequently , the inﬂuence of the clathrin triskelion on the activity of WT FKBP36 and FKBP36 R81L was assayed , but the measured prolyl isomerization in the presence of F IGURE 1 : Substrate speciﬁcity of FKBP36 R81L . The ratios of the speciﬁcity constants k cat / K m for peptide substrates of the type Suc - Ala - Xaa - Pro - Phe - 4 - nitroanilide are shown . PPIase activity against the Suc - Ala - Phe - Pro - Phe - 4 - nitroanilide substrate was set to 100 % . F IGURE 2 : FKBP36 interacts directly with CHC . ( A ) Coomassie - stained SDS - PAGE ( 10 % ) of samples of an incubation experiment using puriﬁed clathrin trimer from rat testis and the GST - FKBP36 protein - or GST - preloaded GSH - Sepharose . Samples without CHC served as the control . ( B ) GSH - Sepharose preloaded with either GST - FKBP36 variants or only GST was incubated with rat testes lysate and subsequently analyzed by SDS - PAGE and Western blotting using anti - CHC . ( C ) Rat testes lysate was incubated with GSH - Sepharose preloaded with different GST - FKBP36 variants and analyzed by SDS - PAGE and Western blotting using anti - CHC and anti - GST antibodies . ( D ) GST - FKBP36 variants were loaded on GSH - Sepharose and incubated with rat testes lysate either in the presence or in the absence of FK506 and subsequently analyzed by SDS - PAGE and Western blotting using anti - CHC antibodies . 6948 Biochemistry , Vol . 47 , No . 26 , 2008 Jarczowski et al . either WT FKBP36 or FKBP36 R81L was not inﬂuenced by clathrin trimers ( data not shown ) . However , clathrin showed interactions with the FKBP36 R81L variant similar to those of the wild - type protein ( Figure 2C ) . Furthermore , we tested the inﬂuence of FK506 on the interaction between clathrin and FKBP36 ( Figure 2D ) . The interaction between both proteins was not inﬂuenced by FK506 , which is in agreement with the ﬁndings that ( i ) FK506 does not inhibit FKBP36 and ( ii ) the clathrin triskelion has no inﬂuence on FKBP36 activity . These results demonstrate that clathrin binds to the PPIase domain of FKBP36 , but no interactions between the active site of FKBP36 and CHC are involved . FKBP36 Is a Component of Clathrin - Coated Vesicles . To analyze cellular interactions between FKBP36 and clathrin , a subcellular fractionation of rat testes cells was performed . FKBP36 was found to localize in the nucleus and cytoplasm , as previously reported ( 3 ) . Figure 3A shows that in addition a signiﬁcant fraction of endogenous FKBP36 was extracted from membranes with 0 . 5 M Tris , which is typical for components of clathrin - coated vesicles . In a further attempt to analyze whether the interaction partners are found colocalized in the cell , the subcellular compartments were further fractionated by differential centrifugation . Figure 3B shows a similar pattern for clathrin and FKBP36 , showing that both interaction partners are similarly distributed in the compartments of rat testes cells . In addition , a signiﬁcant population of Hsp72 was detected to colocalize with FKBP36 and CHC in the fraction of clathrin - coated vesicles . Moreover , puriﬁed vesicles from rat testes were subjected to a sucrose gradient centrifugation to analyze the association of FKBP36 with the clathrin coat . After fractionation , the distribution of different proteins was subjected to Western blot analysis . CHC was identiﬁed in fractions 6 - 27 with a peak in fraction 15 , and (cid:1) - adaptins were found in fractions 9 - 27 ( Figure 3C ) . A similar distribution in the sucrose gradient was observed for the endogenous FKBP36 . Moreover , copuriﬁed FKBP36 is found in the supernatant after disassembly of the matrix of clathrin - coated vesicles ( Figure 3D ) . The FKBP36 pattern is , thus , similar to the results found for clathrin . Collectively , these ﬁndings show that FKBP36 binds to matrix proteins of clathrin - coated vesicles . In pull - down experiments in which puriﬁed clathrin - coated vesicles are loaded onto a GST - FKBP36 afﬁnity matrix , in addition to CHC , (cid:1) - adaptins and Hsp72 were identiﬁed binders of the FKBP36 matrix ( Figure 3E ) . Analogous experiments with dissociated clathrin - coated vesicles resulted in binding of clathrin trimers and Hsp72 to the FKBP36 afﬁnity matrix , whereas (cid:1) - adaptins did not bind ( Figure 3E ) . Hence , FKBP36 interacts directly with clathrin and Hsp72 in the matrix of clathrin - coated vesicles . The interaction among FKBP36 , clathrin , and Hsp72 is independent of the assembly of the clathrin triskelion to clathrin - coated vesicles . FKBP36 Discriminates between Different Hsp70 Proteins . Since FKBP36 interacts with clathrin and Hsp72 , we analyzed whether CHC and Hsp72 compete for the same binding site in FKBP36 . To this end , we applied Hsp72 to different FKBP36 variants with GST fusion proteins loaded on GSH - Sepharose . Hsp72 bound speciﬁcally to afﬁnity matrices loaded with WT FKBP36 and the FKBP36 145 - 327 variant that comprises the C - terminal TPR domain of FKBP36 ( Figure 4A ) . TPR domains are known to mediate the interaction with the C - terminal domains of either Hsp70 proteins or Hsp90 . Thus , the puriﬁed C - terminal Hsp72 domain was used in a competition experiment with endogenous proteins interacting with a FKBP36 afﬁnity matrix ( Figure 4B ) . Indeed , the puriﬁed C - terminal Hsp72 domain competed with endog - enous Hsp72 , demonstrating an interaction between FKBP36 and the C - terminal domain of Hsp72 . Moreover , the C - terminal Hsp72 domain competed also with Hsp90 for FKBP36 binding , which clearly shows that both heat shock proteins bind to FKBP36 in a similar manner . These observations were conﬁrmed by a competition of the C - terminal Hsp90 domain with both Hsp72 and Hsp90 from rat testes lysate . Hence , FKBP36 forms complexes with clathrin and either Hsp72 or Hsp90 . Hsp72 is not the only member of the Hsp70 family that is expressed in testes cells ( 13 ) . Hence , we performed a pull - down experiment using puriﬁed C - terminal domains of Hsp90 , Hsp72 , Hsp70c , Hsp71 , and Hsp70L to investigate the possibility of selective interactions between FKBP36 and the different members of the Hsp70 family . Figure 5A shows that the C - terminal domains of Hsp90 and Hsp72 bind to the FKBP36 afﬁnity matrix as in previous experiments . The C - terminal domains of other Hsp70 family members , however , did not bind to FKBP36 in signiﬁcant amounts . Thus , FKBP36 discriminates between the Hsp70 proteins and binds preferentially to Hsp72 . These results were also conﬁrmed by ﬂuorescence measurements ( Figure 5B ) . Only the presence of the C - terminal Hsp72 domain changed the protein ﬂuorescence of FKBP36 signiﬁcantly . DISCUSSION The testis - speciﬁc FKBP36 is essential in male fertility and has apparently several interaction partners , which indicate different physiological functions of this multidomain PPIase . Our results demonstrate that these interactions are mediated , in part , by the catalytic domain , even though the putative active site is probably not involved and WT FKBP36 lacks PPIase activity against standard tetrapeptide substrates . In contrast , the FKBP36 R81L variant exhibited catalytic activity and unique substrate speciﬁcity . Thus , the catalytic domain of FKBP36 is , in principle , able to catalyze the cis - trans isomerization of prolyl bonds in polypeptide chains , but the presence of the Arg 81 side chain in the putative active side interferes with the PPIase activity of FKBP36 . Consequently , FKBP36 either has substrates that differ greatly from the peptides that were used or requires prior activation by an unknown mechanism . In the absence of a physiological substrate peptide , one could only speculate that FKBP36 substrates may not even involve proline residues , if FKBP36 is constitutively active . Peptide bond isomerase activity against substrates without proline residues has been described previously as a feature of secondary amide bond isomerases ( 14 ) . However , FKBP36 could also be regulated by an unknown mechanism and thus be involved in a speciﬁc signal transduction pathway . FKBP38 , which has the sequence most similar to that of FKBP36 among the human FKBPs , is inactive in its free form like FKBP36 , but FKBP38 becomes activated upon binding to CaM - Ca 2 + and then participates in neuronal apoptosis control by inhibition of Bcl - 2 ( 11 ) . Interestingly , Clathrin - FKBP36 - Hsp72 Complex Biochemistry , Vol . 47 , No . 26 , 2008 6949 F IGURE 3 : FKBP36 is a component of clathrin - coated vesicles . ( A ) Western blot analysis of a subcellular fractionation of either rat testis cells or rat liver using anti - CHC , anti - FKBP36 , anti - GAPDH , and anti - histone antibodies . ( B ) Western blot analysis of a clathrin - coated vesicle preparation from rat testis lysate by differential centrifugation . The supernatant ( S ) and pellet ( P ) of sedimentation steps at 17000 g , 76000 g , and 100000 g and accordingly a sucrose - ﬁcoll gradient ( SF ) were analyzed using anti - CHC , anti - Hsp72 , and anti - FKBP36 antibodies . ( C ) Fractions of a sucrose gradient centrifugation ( from 0 to 60 % sucrose ) of puriﬁed clathrin - coated vesicles were analyzed by Western blotting using anti - (cid:1) - adaptin , anti - CHC , and anti - FKBP36 antibodies . ( D ) Sedimentation analysis of FKBP36 and CHC from either assembled or dissociated clathrin - coated vesicles . The supernatant ( S ) and pellet ( P ) from an ultracentrifugation were analyzed by Western blotting using anti - CHC and anti - FKBP36 antibodies . ( E ) GST - FKBP36 protein - loaded GSH - Sepharose was incubated with either assembled ( Mes ) or dissociated ( Tris ) clathrin - coated vesicles . The presence of CHC , (cid:1) - adaptin , and Hsp72 in the eluate was analyzed by Western blotting . 6950 Biochemistry , Vol . 47 , No . 26 , 2008 Jarczowski et al . both CaM - Ca 2 + - bound FKBP38 and FKBP36 R81L have comparable activities that are signiﬁcantly lower than those of constitutively active FKBP family members . FKBP36 may bind to an unknown activating factor or is perhaps phos - phorylated at surface residues Tyr 75 and Thr 90 , which then may form salt bridges with the Arg 81 side chain and thus remove the positive charge form the hydrophobic putative active site to activate the PPIase in a manner similar to that of FKBP38 . Functional interactions of the FKBP36 PPIase domain , even without an involvement of the putative active site , mediate the interactions with CHC of the clathrin triskelion . Similar interactions between the PPIase domains of FKBP52 and structural proteins without the participation of the PPIase activities have been reported previously ( 15 ) . In parallel to these complexes , FKBP36 interacts also via its TPR domain with the C - terminal domains of heat shock proteins , which has also been found for FKBP38 , FKBP51 , FKBP52 , and FKBP37 . 7 ( 16 – 18 ) . Thus , FKBP36 might mediate the assembly of multiprotein complexes associated with clathrin - coated vesicles in parallel to the role of FKBP52 in steroid hormone receptor complexes ( 19 ) . Within these complexes , FKBP36 might link clathrin and either Hsp72 or Hsp90 to yet unknown client proteins . However , the interactions among FKBP36 , clathrin , and Hsp72 could also be important in another process in spermatocytes : Hsp72 is closely related to Hsc70 , which was shown to disassemble the clathrin matrices ( 20 ) . Hsc70 is localized to clathrin - coated vesicles due to interactions with auxillin which , in turn , binds to CHC ( 21 ) . However , auxillin is not present in spermatocytes ( 22 ) , suggesting the involve - ment of other proteins in the disassembly of clathrin - coated vesicles . Since FKBP36 binds directly to CHC and Hsp72 in testis cells , as demonstrated by the fractionation of rat testes lysate , the resulting clathrin - FKBP36 - Hsp72 com - plexes may have a role in the disassembly of the clathrin coat in the maturation process of this vesicle type . Our results demonstrate , furthermore , speciﬁc binding between FKBP36 and Hsp72 . Thus , FKBP36 is the ﬁrst example of a TPR - containing protein that discriminates between different members of the Hsp70 family . Interest - ingly , both FKBP36 and Hsp72 play a role in meiosis regulation ( 3 , 23 ) . Moreover , the knockout of the genes encoding FKBP36 or Hsp72 individually results in similar phenotypes , with infertile males and perfectly normal females . Thus , FKBP36 and Hsp72 appear to participate in the same process in male meiosis , likely forming FKBP36 - Hsp72 complexes . Thus , the testis - speciﬁc FKBP36 partici - F IGURE 4 : FKBP36 TPR domain interacting with the C - terminal Hsp72domain .
