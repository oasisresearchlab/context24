O ’ Donnell 2 , 3 , 4 , * ABSTRACT Clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) is a well - studied mechanism to internalize plasma membrane proteins ; however , to endocytose such cargo , most eukaryotic cells also use alternative clathrin - independent endocytic ( CIE ) pathways , which are less well characterized . The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , a widely used model for studying CME , was recently shown to have a CIE pathway that requires the GTPase Rho1 , the formin Bni1 , and their regulators . Nevertheless , in both yeast and mammalian cells , the mechanisms underlying cargo selection in CME and CIE are only beginning to be understood . For CME in yeast , particular α - arrestins contribute to recognition of specific cargos and promote their ubiquitylation by recruiting the E3 ubiquitin protein ligase Rsp5 . Here , we show that the same α - arrestin – cargo pairs promote internalization through the CIE pathway by interacting with CIE components . Notably , neither expression of Rsp5 nor its binding to α - arrestins is required for CIE . Thus , α - arrestins are important for cargo selection in both the CME and CIE pathways , but function by distinct mechanisms in each pathway . KEY WORDS : Plasma membrane , Internalization , Protein trafficking , Ubiquitin ligase , Yeast INTRODUCTION Organelle identity , membrane composition and cellular signaling rely on accurate protein and membrane sorting . A dynamic interplay between exocytosis and endocytosis is essential to maintain the composition of the plasma membrane . Selective cargo sorting into Golgi - derived secretory vesicles and endosome - derived recycling vesicles , and subsequent targeting and fusion of these vesicles to the plasma membrane , is crucial for delivery of cargo to the cell surface . By contrast , endocytosis internalizes cargo from the plasma membrane , and is important for nutrient uptake , turnover of damaged proteins , regulation of membrane composition and response to extracellular signals . Sorting decisions differentiate between proteins that will be internalized and those that will remain at the plasma membrane . Proteins often undergo post - translational modification , including phosphorylation and ubiquitylation , before internalization ( Goh and Sorkin , 2013 ; Marchese and Trejo , 2013 ; Nikko et al . , 2008 ) . Modified proteins are recognized by endocytic adaptors , which link membranes , cargos and the endocytic machinery ( Polo et al . , 2002 ; Reider and Wendland , 2011 ; Shih et al . , 2002 ) . Sorting decisions not only determine which proteins are internalized , they also direct cargo into specific endocytic pathways . Clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) , in which clathrin forms a stabilizing coat around the vesicle , is the best - characterized endocytic mechanism . However , most eukaryotic cells have multiple clathrin - independent endocytic ( CIE ) pathways ( Mayor et al . , 2014 ) . CIE pathways promote internalization through alternative mechanisms or cell surface structures , including lipid - enriched membrane microdomains ( i . e . caveolae , CLIC – GEEC pathway ) , membrane ruffles / protrusions ( i . e . phagocytosis and macropinocytosis ) or activation of Rho - or Arf - family small GTPases ( Lamaze et al . , 2001 ; Radhakrishna et al . , 1996 ; Sabharanjak et al . , 2002 ) . Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a widely - used model for CME , and has provided important insights into the composition , dynamics and regulation of CME that are widely conserved ( Boettner et al . , 2012 ; Kaksonen et al . , 2003 , 2005 ) . Despite genetic evidence that additional endocytic routes existed ( Chu et al . , 1996 ; Payne et al . , 1988 ) , yeast were thought to rely solely on CME ; however , recent evidence demonstrated the existence of a yeast CIE pathway that depends on the GTPase Rho1 and the formin Bni1 ( Prosser and Wendland , 2012 ; Prosser et al . , 2011 ) . In addition , a CIE pathway was discovered in Candida albicans ( Epp et al . , 2013 ) and an alternative endocytic route in S . cerevisiae , using only a few CME proteins , might function when CME is impaired ( Aghamohammadzadeh et al . , 2014 ) . Thus , yeasts use multiple internalization pathways , but the mechanisms of cargo selection and sorting , as well as regulation of these ‘ alternative ’ non - CME pathways remain poorly understood in yeast and mammals . Here , we define a previously unrecognized role for α - arrestins in CIE cargo selection . S . cerevisiae α - arrestins are a family of 14 proteins , classified based on predicted structural similarity with mammalian β - arrestins and with well - established roles in cargo sorting during CME and other trafficking intervals ( Alvarez , 2008 ; Becuwe et al . , 2012 ; Lin et al . , 2008 ) . Yeast α - arrestins bind cargo proteins and act as adaptors to recruit the E3 ubiquitin protein ligase Rsp5 , which in turn ubiquitylates cargo to stimulate recognition by the CME machinery ( Lin et al . , 2008 ; Nikko and Pelham , 2009 ; Nikko et al . , 2008 ) . We show that individual α - arrestins , or sets of α - arrestins , promote internalization of the same cargos by both CME and CIE pathways . Furthermore , phospho - regulation of α - arrestin - mediated cargo trafficking , as observed in CME ( O ’ Donnell et al . , 2013 ) , also appears to occur during CIE . Strikingly , whereas internalization through CME requires binding of Rsp5 to α - arrestins , Received 9 June 2015 ; Accepted 5 October 2015 1 Departmentof Biology , The Johns Hopkins University , Baltimore , MD 21218 , USA . 2 DepartmentofBiologicalSciences , UniversityofPittsburgh , Pittsburgh , PA15260 , USA . 3 Division of Biochemistry , Biophysics and Structural Biology , Department of MolecularandCellBiology , UniversityofCalifornia , Berkeley , CA94720 - 3202 , USA . 4 Department of Biological Sciences , Duquesne University , Pittsburgh , PA 15282 , USA . * Author for correspondence ( odonne15 @ duq . edu ; dprosser @ jhu . edu ) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License ( http : / / creativecommons . org / licenses / by / 3 . 0 ) , which permits unrestricted use , distributionandreproductioninanymediumprovidedthattheoriginalworkisproperlyattributed . 4220 © 2015 .

Instead , α - arrestins regulate cargo selection by binding to components of the CIE machinery . Thus , α - arrestins play mechanistically distinct roles in the CME and CIE pathways in S . cerevisiae . RESULTS Specific α - arrestins interact with components of the CIE pathway Previous studies demonstrated a role for the α - arrestins Aly1 and Aly2 in post - endocytic sorting ( O ’ Donnell et al . , 2010 ) . To better understand the function of these α - arrestins , we identified potential binding partners by mass spectrometry . Using this approach , two distinct peptides from Rho1 GDP - GTP exchange factor 2 ( Rom2 ) were detected among the proteins that interacted with these α - arrestins . The peptides were present at a 4 - fold enrichment with α - arrestin when compared with GST - alone control pull - down experiments ( O ’ Donnell et al . , 2010 ) ( A . F . O . , A . Apffel , R . G . Gardner and M . S . Cyert , unpublished results ) . Rom2 , and its paralog Rom1 , are Rho1 - specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) ( Ozaki et al . , 1996 ) that contribute to the cell wall integrity pathway ( Levin , 2005 ) and have been implicated in CIE ( Prosser et al . , 2011 ) . To confirm the association between Aly2 and Rom2 , Gal4 DNA - binding domain ( DBD ) fusions of Rom2 and Rom1 were used as bait in yeast two - hybrid ( Y2H ) analyses with fusions of the Gal4 transcriptional activation domain ( TAD ) to Aly2 , its N - terminal arrestin domain ( residues 1 - 599 ) or its C - terminus ( residues 600 - 1046 ) . We found that the Aly2 C - terminus interacted with Rom2 , whereas full - length Aly2 did not ( Fig . 1A ) . Exposure of the C - terminus in full - length Aly2 might require some regulatory event . However , we observed previously that full - length TAD – Aly2 is present at lower levels than the TAD – Aly2 C - tail construct ( O ’ Donnell et al . , 2013 ) , possibly explaining its lack of interaction with Rom2 . Using the same method , TAD fusions to other full - length α - arrestins failed to interact with DBD – Rom1 or DBD – Rom2 ( data not shown ) . Certain Rho family GTPases bind mammalian β - arrestins ( Barnes et al . , 2005 ; Bhattacharya et al . , 2002 ; Claing et al . , 2001 ; Lefkowitz and Shenoy , 2005 ) . Therefore , we explored whether Rho1 can bind to yeast α - arrestins . As judged by Y2H analyses using DBD – Rho1 as bait , robust association with TAD fusions to each of the 14 yeast α - arrestins was not detected ( data not shown ) . As an alternative approach , we examined whether in vitro transcribed - translated , radiolabeled α - arrestins associated in pull - down assays with GST – Rho1 , GST – Ypt1 ( a Rab protein ) or GST – Ras2 . Only GST – Rho1 consistently retained each of the six α - arrestins tested above the GST control level , and only for Ldb19 and Rog3 was binding to GST – Ras2 comparable to that of GST – Rho1 ( Fig . 1B ) . By using Rho1 mutants ( Schmelzle et al . , 2002 ; Sekiya - Kawasaki et al . , 2002 ) locked in the GTP - bound or nucleotide - free state [ Rho1 Q68L and Rho1 G22A , respectively ( Fig . 1C ) ] or using non - hydrolysable versions of GTP or GDP ( GTP γ - S and GDP β - S , respectively ) ( Fig . 1D ) , we consistently found that binding of the three α - arrestins tested ( Ldb19 , Aly1 and Aly2 ) was unaffected . These data suggest that the interface between Rho1 and these α - arrestins does not involve the switch I and switch II regions . We also found that each of the GST – α - arrestins precipitated more HA – Rho1 compared with the GST control when extracts from cells expressing GST or GST – α - arrestin fusions and HA – Rho1 were used . These results suggest that the α - arrestins Aly1 , Aly2 , Ldb19 , Rod1 and Rog3 associate with Rho1 in vivo ( Fig . 1E ) . α - Arrestins promote cargo internalization in CME - deficient cells Rho1 is a component of yeast CIE ( Prosser and Wendland , 2012 ; Prosser et al . , 2011 ) . Given the observed associations between Aly2 and the Rho1 GEF Rom2 and between α - arrestins and Rho1 , we asked whether α - arrestins operate in CIE , as they do in CME ( Lin et al . , 2008 ; Nikko and Pelham , 2009 ) . CIE in yeast was identified using a mutant strain ( hereafter referred to as 4 Δ ) lacking four monomeric clathrin - binding adaptor proteins – Ent1 and Ent2 ( epsin homologs ) and Yap1801 and Yap1802 ( AP180 / PICALM homologs ) ( Prosser et al . , 2011 ) . ENT1 and ENT2 are an essential gene pair ; however , expression of the PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding epsin N - terminal homology ( ENTH ) domain is sufficient to maintain viability ( Aguilar et al . , 2006 ) . Although viable , 4 Δ cells expressing the ENTH1 domain ( 4 Δ + ENTH1 ) are defective for CME cargo internalization , whereas additional expression of any one of the four deleted adaptor proteins in 4 Δ cells restores CME . In 4 Δ + ENTH1 cells , actin patch proteins exhibit grossly aberrant dynamics at the cell cortex and 4 Δ + ENTH1 cells are temperature - sensitive at 37°C ( Maldonado - Báez et al . , 2008 ; Prosser et al . , 2011 , 2010 ) . Dosage suppressors of 4 Δ + ENTH1 temperature sensitivity restored growth and improved endocytosis of the plasma membrane proteins Ste3 ( a - factor receptor ) and Mup1 ( methionine permease ) ( Prosser et al . , 2011 ) . Among the candidates identified were plasmids expressing the Rho1 - activating cell wall stress sensor Mid2 , the Rho1 GEF Rom1 and the GTPase Rho1 ( Prosser et al . , 2011 ) . The Rom1 paralog Rom2 also suppressed the 4 Δ + ENTH1 endocytic defect ( D . C . P . , unpublished results ) . The observed suppression required the formin Bni1 and Bni1 - binding proteins Spa2 and Bud6 , which are subunits of the polarisome complex involved in polarized actin assembly ( Sheu et al . , 1998 ) ; however , suppression was independent of clathrin and other CME machinery ( Prosser et al . , 2011 ) . On the basis of the published data summarized above , we examined whether high - copy expression of any yeast α - arrestin could suppress the 4 Δ + ENTH1 endocytic defect . Ste3 – GFP was used to track cargo internalization in these CME - deficient cells because it is constitutively internalized and trafficked to the vacuole in wild - type ( WT ) cells , but is retained at the plasma membrane when CME is impaired ( Maldonado - Báez et al . , 2008 ; Urbanowski and Piper , 2001 ) . As expected , WT cells and 4 Δ cells expressing full - length Ent1 ( 4 Δ + Ent1 ) displayed little plasma membrane fluorescence but pronounced vacuolar fluorescence ( Fig . 2A ) ( Maldonado - Báez et al . , 2008 ; Prosser et al . , 2011 ) . By contrast , in 4 Δ + ENTH1 cells carrying vector , prominent plasma membrane fluorescence was evident , indicative of defective endocytosis of Ste3 – GFP . In 4 Δ + ENTH1 cells expressing high - copy Rom1 , Ste3 – GFP internalization was restored , as evidenced by decreased plasma membrane fluorescence and increased vacuolar fluorescence ( Fig . 2A ) . Likewise , and as judged by the same criterion , high - copy expression of α - arrestins Aly1 , Aly2 and Ldb19 promoted internalization of Ste3 – GFP , whereas nine other α - arrestins ( Art5 , Rim8 , Bul1 , Bul2 , Ecm21 , Csr2 , Rod1 , Rog3 and Art10 ) had little or no effect ( Fig . 2A ) . The suggestion that Aly1 , Aly2 and Ldb19 promote Ste3 internalization by CIE was confirmed by repeating these experiments in cells expressing Ste3 tagged with superecliptic pHluorin , a pH - sensitive GFP variant whose fluorescence is quenched in the acidic vacuole ( Miesenböck et al . , 1998 ) . This strategy allows the intensity of plasma membrane fluorescence to be quantified in the absence of vacuole - localized signal ( Prosser et al . , 2010 ) . As seen with Rom1 , we found that high - copy expression of 4221 RESEARCH ARTICLE Journal of Cell Science ( 2015 ) 128 , 4220 - 4234 doi : 10 . 1242 / jcs . 175372 J o u r n a l o f C e ll S c i e n c e Fig . 1 . α - Arrestins interact with the Rho1 GEF Rom2 and the GTPase Rho1 .

To distinguish among these mechanisms , we examined whether high - level Rom1 could still promote Ste3 – GFP internalization in 4 Δ + ENTH1 cells lacking ALY1 , ALY2 and LDB19 . In cells retaining CME ( either the WT or 4 Δ + Ent1 background ) , absence of Aly1 , Aly2 and Ldb19 caused a modest retention of Ste3 – GFP at the plasma membrane , indicating that these α - arrestins contribute to internalization of Ste3 when CME is intact ( Fig . 2C ) , but also produce a readily detectable vacuolar signal , suggesting that other α - arrestins also contribute to CME of Ste3 . Ste3 – GFP retention at the plasma membrane was more pronounced in 4 Δ + ENTH1 aly1 Δ aly2 Δ ldb19 Δ cells than in aly1 Δ aly2 Δ ldb19 Δ yeast . Importantly , in these cells , high - level Rom1 expression was impaired in its ability to reduce plasma membrane fluorescence and restore vacuolar localization , whereas high - level expression of any of the three α - arrestins efficiently reduced the plasma membrane fluorescence ( Fig . 2C ) . This result indicates that the Rho1 - dependent CIE pathway for Ste3 internalization requires Aly1 , Aly2 or Ldb19 . We next considered the possibility that Aly1 , Aly2 and Ldb19 promote vacuole localization of Ste3 – GFP in 4 Δ + ENTH1 cells by diverting cargo destined for the plasma membrane directly to endosomes or to the vacuole , thwarting Golgi - to - plasma - membrane transport . To address this possibility , we treated cells with the actin - depolymerizing drug latrunculin A ( LatA ) , which blocks endocytosis but not Golgi - to - vacuole transport ( Huang and Chang , 2011 ) . After 2 h with LatA , Ste3 – GFP accumulated at the plasma membrane in WT and 4 Δ + Ent1 cells , consistent with continued plasma membrane delivery and defective endocytosis ( Fig . 3 ) . In 4 Δ + ENTH1 cells with vector or high - copy Art5 or Rim8 , Ste3 – GFP was retained at the plasma membrane in untreated cells and showed similar localization after LatA treatment . Importantly , Ste3 – GFP accumulated at the plasma membrane in LatA - treated 4 Δ + ENTH1 cells with high - copy Rom1 , Aly1 , Aly2 and Ldb19 ( Fig . 3 and Prosser et al . , 2011 ) , demonstrating that Rom1 and α - arrestins do not affect transport of cargo to the plasma membrane . As further evidence for a role for Rom1 and α - arrestins in uptake of plasma membrane cargo , we performed a washout experiment Fig . 2 .

After accumulation of Ste3 – GFP at the plasma membrane , LatA was removed from the medium , allowing resumption of actin polymerization and endocytosis . Under these conditions , Ste3 – GFP relocalized from the plasma membrane to the vacuole in WT and 4 Δ + Ent1 cells , but remained at the plasma membrane in 4 Δ + ENTH1 cells transformed with vector , Art5 or Rim8 ( Fig . 3 ) , consistent with impaired endocytosis in CME - deficient cells . By contrast , in 4 Δ + ENTH1 cells expressing high - copy Rom1 , Aly1 , Aly2 and Ldb19 , endocytosis of Ste3 – GFP was partially restored , as judged by faint , but detectable , vacuolar fluorescence and reduced Ste3 – GFP fluorescence at the plasma membrane . Thus , α - arrestins promote endocytosis of plasma membrane cargos ( see also later results ) . To verify that α - arrestins act through CIE , we deleted BNI1 in the 4 Δ + ENTH1 cells , as Bni1 is a required component of the CIE pathway ( Prosser et al . , 2011 ) . As seen previously , the absence of Bni1 did not affect Ste3 internalization in either WT or 4 Δ + Ent1 cells , as judged by either Ste3 – GFP localization ( Fig . 4A ) or the Ste3 - pHluorin signal intensity ( Fig . 4B ) . In 4 Δ + ENTH1 cells lacking BNI1 , overexpression of Rom1 or any α - arrestin tested was unable to promote efficient Ste3 endocytosis , as judged by the same criteria ( Fig . 4A , B ) . Similar results were obtained in cells lacking the polarisome subunit Spa2 ( data not shown ) , which binds Bni1 ( Fujiwara et al . , 1998 ) and is required for CIE ( Fujiwara et al . , 1998 ; Prosser et al . , 2011 ) . In contrast , in cells lacking another formin , Bnr1 , which has no apparent role in CIE ( Prosser et al . , 2011 ) , Rom1 , Aly1 , Aly2 or Ldb19 overexpression were effective in stimulating Ste3 endocytosis ( Fig . S1A , B ) . These findings further support the conclusion that Aly1 , Aly2 or Ldb19 promote Ste3 internalization by the CIE pathway . High - copy α - arrestins promote cargo internalization in a clathrin - independent manner To determine whether α - arrestins restore endocytosis in 4 Δ + ENTH1 cells in a manner that might depend on either clathrin or cortical actin patches , we next assessed the ability of α - arrestins to promote internalization of Ste3 in chc1 Δ cells , which lack the clathrin heavy chain . Because clathrin functions in vesicle budding from the plasma membrane or from the trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) , chc1 Δ yeast have defects in multiple trafficking pathways . Furthermore , chc1 Δ cells have fragmented vacuoles , which can obscure observation of plasma membrane cargo proteins ( Burston et al . , 2009 ; Prosser et al . , 2011 ; see also Fig . 4E for a direct comparison of Ste3 – GFP and Ste3 – pHluorin in WT and chc1 Δ cells , as well as in chc1 Δ cells expressing plasmid - borne CHC1 ) . Thus , for this analysis , we used chc1 Δ cells expressing Ste3 – pHluorin . As shown in Fig . 4C - E , we observed that surface fluorescence was high in chc1 Δ cells carrying vector , indicating impaired Ste3 – pHluorin internalization . By contrast , surface fluorescence was greatly diminished in cells expressing high - copy ROM1 , ALY1 , ALY2 or LDB19 , whereas high - copy ART5 and RIM8 had no effect . Thus , like Rom1 , the α - arrestins Aly1 , Aly2 and Ldb19 promote clathrin - independent internalization of Ste3 . To determine whether α - arrestins promote endocytosis in 4 Δ + ENTH1 cells without correcting defects in cortical actin patch assembly and dynamics , we performed two - color total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy ( TIR - FM ) of cells expressing genomically encoded Sla1 – GFP and Abp1 – mCherry . The timing for recruitment of many yeast actin patch proteins is known , thereby defining discrete stages in CME ( Kaksonen et al . , 2003 , 2005 ) . In brief , an early coat complex forms , which initiates recruitment of clathrin , followed by a late coat complex consisting largely of adaptor proteins and endocytic scaffolds necessary for maturation of the nascent endocytic vesicle . At this time , Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization and type I myosin ( Myo3 and Myo5 ) activity powers membrane deformation , followed by the action of proteins that sever the neck to separate the vesicle from the plasma membrane . The vesicle then moves toward the cell interior and actin patch proteins dissociate . Arrival of a protein at , and / or its departure from , a cortical patch can be monitored by time - lapse imaging and displayed as a kymograph . Sla1 , a late coat protein , arrives at cortical patches 30 - 40 s prior to completion of endocytosis and is internalized with the vesicle ; Abp1 , an actin - binding protein , arrives 12 - 15 s before vesicle internalization ( Kaksonen et al . , 2005 ) . Thus , Sla1 – GFP arrives first ( the cortical patch is green ) , is subsequently joined by Abp1 – mCherry ( the patch turns yellow ) , and then both are internalized , which is evident when the patch disappears as the vesicle leaves the TIR - FM field . This stereotypical behavior was readily observed in WT and 4 Δ + Ent1 cells ( Fig . 4F , top two rows ) ; however , Sla1 – GFP patches were static in 4 Δ + ENTH1 cells carrying a vector , as seen previously ( Prosser et al . , 2011 ) . Patches also persisted for over 2 min ( the duration of observation ) and if a patch became decorated with Abp1 – mCherry , it remained similarly static ( Fig . 4F ) . Importantly , high - copy expression of Rom1 or the α - arrestins Aly1 , Aly2 , Ldb19 , Art5 or Rim8 did not alter these patterns ( Fig . 4F ) . Thus , the ability of Aly1 , Aly2 and Ldb19 to promote cargo internalization in 4 Δ + ENTH1 cells is not mediated by restoration of actin patch dynamics , consistent with its lack of dependence on clathrin heavy chain . α - Arrestinfunction inclathrin - independentendocytosisdoes not require Rsp5 α - Arrestins are characterized by an N - terminal arrestin fold domain involved in cargo recognition and a C - terminal tail containing one or more L / PPxY motifs ( Fig . 5A ) , which bind WW domains in Rsp5 ( closest mammalian ortholog is Nedd4L ) ( Chen and Sudol , 1995 ; Lin et al . , 2008 ) . Thus , α - arrestins serve as adaptors that recruit Rsp5 to cargo , thereby facilitating cargo ubiquitylation . Not surprisingly , α - arrestin – Rsp5 binding is crucial for CME ( Lin et al . , 2008 ; Nabhan et al . , 2010 ; Nikko et al . , 2008 ) . To determine whether the function of α - arrestin in CIE similarly requires Rsp5 , we first used ‘ PPxY - less ’ mutants ( Alvaro et al . , 2014 ; O ’ Donnell et al . , 2013 ) in which the consensus L / PPxY motifs of Aly1 , Aly2 or Ldb19 were mutated to abolish Rsp5 binding . Unexpectedly , we found that the Aly1 , Aly2 and Ldb19 PPxY - less mutants still promoted internalization of Ste3 – GFP ( Fig . 5B ) and Ste3 – pHluorin ( Fig . 5C ) in 4 Δ + ENTH1 cells . Moreover , the degree of internalization was indistinguishable from levels observed when the WT α - arrestins were expressed . These data suggest that α - arrestins do not require Rsp5 during CIE , which stands in stark contrast to their function during CME . One potential caveat to the above conclusion is that the PPxY mutations might weaken but not totally abolish Rsp5 binding ( Alvaro et al . , 2014 ) . It is also possible that the requirement for Rsp5 during CIE is lower than during CME . To rule out this possibility , we eliminated Rsp5 and repeated these analyses . Normally , Rsp5 is essential because it promotes ubiquitylation and degradation of many proteins . Importantly , Rsp5 ubiquitylates the essential gene pair , SPT23 and MGA2 ( Hoppe et al . , 2000 ) , which leads to proteasomal cleavage of Spt23 and Mga2 at the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) membrane , and releases their cytoplasmic domains to stimulate transcription of oleate synthesis genes ( Hoppe et al . , 2000 ; Zhang et al . , 1999 ) .

To examine whether CIE functions in the absence of Rsp5 , we constructed an rsp5 Δ strain expressing the cytoplasmic domain of Mga2 ( termed Mga2 Δ TMD ) , as well as Ste3 – GFP . Immunoblot analysis with Rsp5 - specific antibodies confirmed that Rsp5 was absent from rsp5 Δ cell lysates , but present in lysates from yeast carrying an RSP5 plasmid ( Fig . 5D ) . In the rsp5 Δ [ Mga2 Δ TMD ] cells carrying vector , Ste3 – GFP accumulated at the plasma membrane . Consistent with localization at the plasma membrane , cortically localized Ste3 – GFP did not fully overlap with the ER marker RFP – HDEL ( Audhya and Emr , 2003 ) ( i . e . some cortical regions contained Ste3 – GFP but were devoid of ER membranes ) , nor was there any perinuclear Ste3 – GFP , that would suggest ER retention ( Fig . S2 ) . As anticipated , little fluorescent signal was observed in the vacuole , consistent with an endocytic defect . Expression of plasmid - borne RSP5 greatly reduced surface fluorescence and restored Ste3 – GFP trafficking to the vacuole . High - copy YAP1801 , which functions during ubiquitin - dependent CME , was unable to restore Ste3 – GFP internalization , and two high - copy α - arrestins , ART5 or RIM8 , were similarly unable to restore Ste3 internalization . Importantly , high - copy expression of ROM1 , ALY1 , ALY2 or LDB19 reduced Ste3 – GFP at the plasma membrane and greatly increased vacuolar fluorescence in rsp5 Δ + Mga Δ TMD cells . Hence , the three α - arrestins that , when overproduced , promote the CIE of Ste3 , still do so in the absence of Rsp5 .

To corroborate the latter conclusion , we used an independent method to assess whether these three α - arrestins have a discernible impact on Ste3 - dependent response to a - factor when CME is intact . High - copy expression of Aly1 , Aly2 or Ldb19 stimulated Ste3 – GFP internalization in 4 Δ + ENTH1 cells , hinting that Aly1 , Aly2 and Ldb19 play overlapping roles . For this reason , we generated single ( aly1 Δ , aly2 Δ and ldb19 Δ ) , double ( aly1 Δ aly2 Δ , aly1 Δ ldb19 Δ and aly2 Δ ldb19 Δ ) and isogenic triple ( aly1 Δ aly2 Δ ldb19 Δ ) mutants . Each single mutant exhibited a Ste3 – GFP distribution that was indistinguishable from that in WT yeast , indicating efficient receptor internalization ( Fig . 6A ) . However , in cells lacking any pair of these α - arrestins , or all three , Ste3 – GFP accumulated at the plasma membrane . In contrast , Ste3 – GFP internalization was unimpaired in a strain lacking two other α - arrestins , Art5 and Rim8 ( Fig . 6A ) , which are a paralogous pair analogous to Aly1 and Aly2 and whose individual overexpression had no impact on CIE of Ste3 ( Fig . 2 ) . For Aly1 , Aly2 and Ldb19 , the increased Ste3 – GFP plasma membrane fluorescence in cells lacking any two of these α - arrestins suggested that they each help to downregulate the a - factor receptor when CME is intact . When the Ste3 GPCR on the surface of MAT α cells binds the a - factor pheromone , the MAP kinase cascade is activated , resulting in changes in gene expression that promote mating and induce growth arrest ( Bardwell et al . , 1994 ) . Responsiveness to a - factor is assessed by an agar diffusion ( ‘ halo ’ ) bioassay that measures growth arrest of sensitized reporter cells ( i . e . MAT α sst2 Δ , where a negative regulator of the mating pathway , an RGS protein , is deleted ) that have been challenged with an a - factor - soaked filter disk ( Kuchler et al . , 1989 ) . We found that sst2 Δ cells lacking ALY1 , ALY2 and LDB19 were more sensitive to a - factor compared with the sst2 Δ control cells over a range of concentrations ( Fig . 6B ) . Negative regulation of the mating pathway by these α - arrestins is consistent with their role in internalizing Ste3 . It is possible , however , that these α - arrestins contribute in other ways to signal desensitization . Given their ability to both stimulate removal of Ste3 from the plasma membrane and reduce a - factor sensitivity in cells with intact CME , it seems likely that , as in CIE , the same adaptors play a role in internalization of Ste3 by CME . Together these data suggest that , when the efficiency of Ste3 internalization in MAT α cells is impaired in the absence of Aly1 , Aly2 and Ldb19 , greater persistence of Ste3 at the plasma membrane leads to more signaling through the mating pheromone pathway , which , in turn , prolongs growth arrest . The role for Aly1 , Aly2 and Ldb19 in regulating Ste3 - dependent response to a - factor is similar to what we recently demonstrated for α - arrestins Rod1 , Rog3 and Ldb19 in down - modulating the α - factor receptor ( Ste2 ) in MAT a cells ( Alvaro et al . , 2014 ) . In brief , we found that two paralogous α - arrestins , Rod1 and Rog3 , as well as Ldb19 were required for optimal downregulation of the Ste2 - dependent mating pathway in response to α - factor and for removal of Ste2 from the plasma membrane . Here , we found a similar requirement for two paralogous α - arrestins , Aly1 and Aly2 , as well as Ldb19 in downregulation of Ste3 . We next sought to determine whether phospho - regulation of the α - arrestins in these pathways was similarly conserved . Dephosphorylation of Rod1 by calcineurin , which is a phosphoprotein phosphatase , is required for optimal Rod1 - mediated negative regulation of Ste2 ( Alvaro et al . , 2014 ) . Previously , we established that Aly1 is also a calcineurin substrate and that dephosphorylation of Aly1 by calcineurin enhances its ability to mediate removal of a nutrient permease from the plasma membrane ( O ’ Donnell et al . , 2013 ) . Therefore , to determine whether calcineurin - dependent dephosphorylation of Aly1 promotes Ste3 endocytosis and negatively regulates Ste3 - initiated signaling , we used three approaches . First , we found , as expected , that re - introduction of either Ldb19 , Aly2 or Aly1 reduced sensitivity of MAT α aly1 Δ aly2 Δ ldb19 Δ sst2 Δ cells to a - factor - evoked growth arrest , whereas re - introduction of Aly1 Δ PILKIN , a mutant that no longer binds or is dephosphorylated by calcineurin ( O ’ Donnell et al . , 2013 ) , was unable to do so ( Fig . 6C ) . Second , in 4 Δ + ENTH1 cells , where overexpression of either Rom1 or WTAly1 promotes internalization of Ste3 – GFP , high - copy Aly1 variants that lack a calcineurin - binding site ( Aly1 Δ PILKIN and Aly1 AAAAAA ) did not correct Ste3 – GFP endocytosis defects , whereas an Aly1 variant with a very - high - affinity calcineurin - binding site ( Aly1 PVIVIT ) did ( Fig . 6D ) . Likewise , an Aly1 variant that is permanently dephosphorylated because its calcineurin - regulated phospho - sites ( Ser or Thr ) have been mutated to Ala , potently stimulated Ste3 – GFP endocytosis , whereas an Aly1 variant that mimics the persistently phosphorylated state , because its calcineurin - regulated phospho - sites have been mutated to Glu , did not ( Fig . 6D ) . Third , WT Aly1 and the same set of Aly1 variants that promoted Ste3 – GFP internalization also facilitated removal of Ste3 – pHluorin from the plasma membrane ( Fig . 6E ) . Taken together , these data indicate that calcineurin - mediated dephosphorylation of Aly1 promotes Ste3 internalization by either the CME or CIE pathways and that particular α - arrestins probably help to select specific endocytic cargo in both the CME and CIE pathways . This model is supported by additional data , provided below . α - Arrestins play cargo - selective roles in both the CME and CIE pathways It is well established that individual α - arrestins bind to and recruit Rsp5 to specific subsets of cargo proteins , promoting their ubiquitylation and CME ( Lin et al . , 2008 ) . In some cases , multiple arrestins bind to a single cargo ( Nikko and Pelham , 2009 ) , as recently shown for interaction of Ldb19 , Rod1 and Rog3 with Ste2 ( Alvaro et al . , 2014 ) . In other cases , a single α - arrestin is mainly responsible for cargo internalization , as demonstrated for Ldb19 and the high - affinity methionine permease ( Mup1 ) ( Lin et al . , 2008 ) . Because our data suggest that Aly1 , Aly2 and Ldb19 promote internalization of Ste3 through both the CME and CIE pathways , we asked whether α - arrestins that act on other cargo do so in both CME and CIE pathways . To examine whether Ldb19 promotes Mup1 internalization by CIE , we monitored internalization of Mup1 – pHluorin ( Prosser et al . , 2010 , 2011 ) in 4 Δ + ENTH1 cells . In the absence of methionine , MUP1 expression is upregulated and the protein is retained at the plasma membrane ; in contrast , when excess methionine is present , MUP1 expression is repressed and the protein traffics to the vacuole and is degraded . Indeed , in WT or 4 Δ + Ent1 cells , Mup1 – pHluorin was cleared from the plasma membrane 30 min after addition of methionine , whereas little diminution in plasma membrane levels of Mup1 – pHluorin was observed in 4 Δ + ENTH1 cells ( Fig . 7A , left panels ) . However , in 4 Δ + ENTH1 cells , overexpression of Rom1 or Ldb19 ( or its L / PPxY variant ; data not shown ) significantly reduced the fluorescence signal , whereas overexpression of four other α - arrestins did not ( Fig . 7A , middle and right panels ) . These data are summarized and quantified in Fig . 7B . Thus , as occurs during CME , internalization of Mup1 by CIE is promoted by Ldb19 . To address the role of Rod1 , Rog3 and Ldb19 during CIE of Ste2 , we examined internalization of Ste2 – GFP . In MAT a cells with intact CME ( WT cells and 4 Δ + Ent1 cells ) , in which constitutive 4228 RESEARCH ARTICLE Journal of Cell Science ( 2015 ) 128 , 4220 - 4234 doi : 10 . 1242 / jcs . 175372 J o u r n a l o f C e ll S c i e n c e Fig . 6 .

In 4 Δ + ENTH1 cells , there was readily detectable plasma membrane fluorescence and diminished vacuolar fluorescence ( Fig . 7C ) . Overexpression of ROM1 , as well as ROD1 and ROG3 ( and their PPxY - less variants ) and to a lesser extent LDB19 ( and its L / PPxY variant ) , reduced the plasma membrane fluorescence and significantly increased vacuolar fluorescence of Ste2 – GFP , whereas overexpression of neither ALY1 nor ALY2 did so ( Fig . 7C ) . Therefore , internalization of Ste2 by CIE is promoted by the same set of α - arrestins that are utilized for CME of Ste2 . DISCUSSION Cargo sorting maintains the appropriate complement of proteins in each subcellular compartment . Given the array of proteins in a compartment , mechanisms must exist to select and concentrate cargos in nascent vesicles , or to exclude specific proteins from transport sites . The existence of multiple trafficking pathways originating from a single compartment requires cargo packaging into the correct transport intermediate . Thus , cargo sorting must be coordinated to ensure maintenance of organelle identity and cellular function . Many aspects of this process are poorly understood . Fig . 6 .

The former is well established . Specifically , α - arrestins act as adaptors that bind cargo and the ubiquitin ligase Rsp5 to stimulate cargo ubiquitylation ( Lin et al . , 2008 ; Nikko and Pelham , 2009 ; Nikko et al . , 2008 ; Springael et al . , 1999 ) . Ubiquitylated cargos are recognized by factors that concentrate endocytic substrates at CME sites ( Polo et al . , 2002 ; Shih et al . , 2002 ) . Here , we show that α - arrestins also drive internalization of cargos through CIE . Moreover , we found that α - arrestin function does not require binding or recruitment of Rsp5 in CIE . Instead , our data indicate that α - arrestins interact with components of the CIE pathway , including Rho1 and its GEF Rom2 . Thus , α - arrestins are likely to utilize distinct mechanisms to mark cargo for internalization by CIE than they do for CME . In yeast , there are 14 α - arrestins , each of which contains predicted arrestin - fold domains likely responsible for cargo interaction , and a C - terminal tail with at least one Rsp5 - binding L / PPxY motif ( Alvarez , 2008 ; Becuwe et al . , 2012 ) . Interaction with cargo and Rsp5 is important for α - arrestin function in CME . The adaptor function of α - arrestins is likely to be conserved . Six mammalian α - arrestins have been identified ( five arrestin - domain - containing proteins , ARRDC1 – ARRDC5 , and thioredoxin - interacting protein , TXNIP ) ( Alvarez , 2008 ; Aubry and Klein , 2013 ) . As in yeast , mammalian α - arrestins bind Nedd4 - family ubiquitin ligases ( Rsp5 homologs ) and promote cargo ubiquitylation ( Nabhan et al . , 2010 ; Patwari and Lee , 2012 ; Shea et al . , 2012 ) . A given α - arrestin can bind one or more specific cargos to promote their ubiquitylation and recognition by the CME machinery , thereby contributing to cargo selection and sorting ( Alvaro et al . , 2014 ; Becuwe et al . , 2012 ; Lin et al . , 2008 ; Nikko and Pelham , 2009 ) . Conversely , multiple α - arrestins can bind to single cargo and regulate its internalization , indicating that arrestins have partially overlapping functions and / or operate differently under distinct sets of conditions ( Alvaro et al . , 2014 ; Nikko and Pelham , 2009 ; O ’ Donnell et al . , 2015 ) . Indeed , for certain cargos , different α - arrestins promote cargo internalization in response to unique ligands or under different stresses or environmental conditions ( Alvaro et al . , 2014 ; Lin et al . , 2008 ; Nikko and Pelham , 2009 ) . In addition to regulating cargo endocytosis , certain α - arrestins participate in Rsp5 - dependent cargo sorting and trafficking at other subcellular compartments . Aly1 , Aly2 , Bul1 and Bul2 are involved in endosomal sorting of the general amino acid permease Gap1 ( O ’ Donnell et al . , 2010 ; Soetens et al . , 2001 ) and Rod1 contributes to TGN - to - vacuole transport of the lactate / H + symporter Jen1 ( Becuwe and Léon , 2014 ) . Moreover , post - translational modifications play key roles in regulating α - arrestin function . Phosphorylation of Ldb19 by the TORC1 - inhibited protein kinase Npr1 prevents endocytosis of Ldb19 - dependent cargo ( MacGurn et al . , 2011 ) , whereas Npr1 - mediated phosphorylation of Aly2 promotes endosome - to - TGN sorting of Gap1 ( O ’ Donnell et al . , 2010 ) . Similarly , phosphorylation of Rod1 by a protein kinase , Snf1 , inhibits the endocytic trafficking of Jen1 ( Becuwe et al . , 2012 ) and the hexose transporters Hxt1 and Hxt3 ( O ’ Donnell et al . , 2015 ) , whereas dephosphorylated Rod1 promotes internalization of Jen1 ( Becuwe et al . , 2012 ) . Additionally , dephosphorylation of Rod1 and Aly1 by the Ca 2 + / calmodulin - activated phosphatase calcineurin promotes endocytosis of , respectively , the α - factor receptor Ste2 ( Alvaro et al . , 2014 ) and the Asp / Glu permease Dip5 ( O ’ Donnell et al . , 2013 ) . Also , α - arrestins are themselves substrates for Rsp5 - dependent ubiquitylation ( Alvaro et al . , 2014 ; Becuwe et al . , 2012 ; Lin et al . , 2008 ; O ’ Donnell et al . , 2013 ) , which may play a role in regulating their function ( Becuwe and Léon , 2014 ; Merhi and André , 2012 ) . Given the established roles of α - arrestins in CME and in post - endocytic trafficking , how do they contribute to CIE ? On the basis of our study , there are some similarities and key differences in how α - arrestins function in CME versus CIE . First , for the cargos tested , selectivity of a given α - arrestin was the same in both pathways : ( 1 ) Ste3 internalization involves Aly1 , Aly2 and Ldb19 ; ( 2 ) Ste2 internalization involves Rod1 , Rog3 and Ldb19 ; and ( 3 ) Mup1 internalization requires Ldb19 . Second , as demonstrated for Aly1 in facilitating internalization of Dip5 by CME ( O ’ Donnell et al . , 2013 ) , we found that calcineurin - mediated dephosphorylation of Aly1 is necessary to promote internalization of Ste3 by CIE . In contrast to their CME function , we found that the utilized α - arrestins do not require Rsp5 binding , or even its presence , to stimulate cargo internalization by CIE . Indeed , high - level expression of the CIE component Rom1 or specific α - arrestins promoted Ste3 endocytosis in rsp5 Δ cells . Initially , our discovery of Rsp5 independence was unexpected , but a previous study indicated that Rsp5 is not strictly required for endocytosis of the Fet3 / Ftr1 iron transporter complex per se ; rather , once internalized , Rsp5 - Fig . 8 . Schematic depiction of the roles played by α - arrestins as cargo - selective regulators of CME and CIE . ( A ) For CME , α - arrestins bind Rsp5 through their L / PPxY motifs and recruit the ligase to cargo proteins . Rsp5 ubiquitylates both the α - arrestin and the cargo to stimulate CME ( Alvaro et al . , 2014 ; Lin et al . , 2008 ; Nikko and Pelham , 2009 ; Nikko et al . , 2008 ; O ’ Donnell et al . , 2013 ) . ( B ) For CIE , Rsp5 and Rsp5 - binding motifs in α - arrestins are dispensable . Instead , we propose that α - arrestins bind cargo proteins and help recruit the Rho1 GTPase and its GEFs , Rom1 or Rom2 . Recruitment of Rho1 to the site of cargo internalization stimulates localized activation of the formin Bni1 and subsequent actin nucleation . This model incorporates cargo selection , GTPase activity and actin nucleation , all of which are key features needed to stimulate endocytosis . 4231 RESEARCH ARTICLE Journal of Cell Science ( 2015 ) 128 , 4220 - 4234 doi : 10 . 1242 / jcs . 175372 J o u r n a l o f C e ll S c i e n c e mediated ubiquitylation promotes ESCRT - dependent transport of the complex to the vacuole lumen , effectively preventing its recycling to the plasma membrane ( Strochlic et al . , 2008 ) . Furthermore , Rog3 does not require Rsp5 binding for its role in downregulation of Ste2 ( Alvaro et al . , 2014 ) ; however , we did not directly assess the ability of Rog3 to promote CME or CIE of Ste2 , and so this Rsp5 independence might reflect a role for Rog3 in CIE . Thus , emerging evidence indicates that α - arrestins can play Rsp5 - independent roles in trafficking . Overall , our data suggest that α - arrestins contribute to CIE by serving as molecular matchmakers , but in a fashion that is different from their role in CME . We found that α - arrestins interact with proteins implicated in CIE , including Rom1 / 2 and Rho1 ( Prosser et al . , 2011 ) . Similarly , a recent study reported that a fission yeast α - arrestin , Art1 , directly associates with the Rho1 GEF Rgf3 ( Davidson et al . , 2015 ) and that this interaction is important during cytokinesis ; thus , interaction with small GTPases and / or their regulators may be a previously unappreciated but common function of α - arrestins . Indeed , this might apply more globally to the arrestin family , because the mammalian β - arrestins bind several small GTPases , including RhoA ( the ortholog of yeast Rho1 ) and GEFs ( Barnes et al . , 2005 ; Bhattacharya et al . , 2002 ; Claing et al . , 2001 ; Lefkowitz and Shenoy , 2005 ) . In this capacity , β - arrestins typically regulate GTPase pathways , similar to the α - arrestin - mediated promotion of Rho1 activity we propose here . It will be interesting in future studies to define the α - arrestin – GTPase binding interface and determine whether this is also conserved across the arrestin family , and to assess the relative contributions of CME and CIE for a specific cargo . MATERIALS AND METHODS Yeast strains and growth conditions Yeast strains and plasmids are described in Tables S1 and S2 , respectively . Yeast were grown in YPD or SC medium lacking the nutrient ( s ) required for plasmid maintenance ( Alvaro et al . , 2014 ; Prosser et al . , 2011 ) and transformed by the lithium acetate method ( Ausubel , 1991 ) . Yeast two - hybrid analysis Y2H tests used PJ69 - 4a ( James et al . , 1996 ) cells containing pGBT9 - derived plasmids with Gal4 DBD fusions and pACT2 - derived plasmids bearing Gal4 TAD fusions ( Bartel et al . , 1993 ; Harper et al . , 1993 ) . Transformants were plated on SC - Leu - Trp as a positive control and on SC - Leu - Trp - His to indicate GAL1 prom - HIS3 activation . In vitro binding of α - arrestins to GST – GTPase fusions BL21 DE3 * E . coli cells were induced to express GST - tagged Rho1 , Ypt1 or Ras2 ( pGEX4T - 1 plasmids ; Table S2 ) with 100 mM IPTG . After 6 h , cells were collected , washed , resuspended , incubated for 10 min on ice in 1× PBS ( pH 7 . 5 ) containing 0 . 2 mg / ml lysozyme , 1 mM DTT , 0 . 5 % Tween - 20 , 10 % glycerol , cOmplete ™ mini EDTA - free protease inhibitor tablet ( Roche Diagnostics , Mannheim , Germany ) and 100 µg / ml DNase and disrupted by sonication . After removal of cell debris , GST - tagged proteins were adsorbed to glutathione - agarose beads for 4 h at 4°C . Beads were washed three times with and resuspended in 20 mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 10 % glycerol and cOmplete ™ mini EDTA - free protease inhibitor . Protein concentration and purity were assessed using the intensity of Coomassie - Blue - stained bands compared with a standard and equivalent amounts of GST , GST – Rho1 , GST – Ypt1 and GST – Ras2 were used in each experiment . To examine nucleotide specificity , bead - bound GST – Rho1 was incubated for 30 min with 0 . 2 mM of GTP , GTP γ - S , GDP or GDP β - S ( Sigma , St Louis , MO ) and wash buffers contained 0 . 2 mM of the corresponding nucleotide . Radiolabeled α - arrestins , generated as described previously ( Alvaro et al . , 2014 ) with the addition of a final purification using Invitrogen Centri - sep Spin Columns ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) to remove residual nucleotides , were incubated with beads containing ∼ 5 µg of GST - tagged protein at 4°C for 2 h in 20 mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 10 % glycerol , 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 and cOmplete ™ mini EDTA - free protease inhibitor . After two washes with 500 µl of the same buffer , bound protein was eluted in SDS - PAGE sample buffer and resolved by SDS - PAGE . After staining with Coomassie Blue , gels were dried and the level of co - purifying [ 35 S ] α - arrestins measured using a Phosphorimager screen , a Typhoon scanner and ImageJ software ( NIH , Bethesda , MD ) . Co - purification of GST – α - arrestins with HA - tagged Rho1 in cell extracts BJ5459 GEV cells carrying vector ( pEGKG ) or plasmids expressing GST – Aly1 , GST – Aly2 , GST – Ldb19 , GST – Rod1 or GST – Rog3 fusions under control of the GAL10 prom were grown and expression induced as described ( Alvaro et al . , 2014 ) . Cells were lysed by vortexing at 4°C with acid - washed glass beads in 600 µl of 100 mM NaCl , 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 , 15 mM EGTA , 50 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 4 ) and cOmplete ™ mini EDTA - free protease inhibitor . After clarification , GST - tagged proteins were adsorbed to glutathione - agarose beads for 3 h at 4°C . After washing the beads twice in the same buffer , they were incubated at 4°C for 2 h with equal amounts of extract from BJ5459 GEV cells expressing HA - Rho1 . After washing three times with 500 µl of the same buffer , bound proteins were eluted in SDS - PAGE sample buffer , resolved by SDS - PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting using : rabbit polyclonal anti - GST ( 1 : 1000 dilution ; cat . no . SC - 495 , Santa Cruz Biotechnologies Inc . , Santa Cruz , CA ) and mouse monoclonal anti - HA antibody 3F10 ( 1 : 1000 dilution ; cat . no . 12158167001 , Roche Diagnostics ) . Immune complexes were detected with IRDye ( 680 or 800 ) - conjugated anti - rabbit , anti - rat or anti - mouse secondary antibodies ( LI - COR Biosciences , Lincoln , NE ) and an Odyssey infrared - imaging system ( Odyssey ™ , LI - COR Biosciences ) . Microscopy and image analysis Image acquisition was performed as described previously for Ste3 – GFP , Ste3 – pHluorin ( Prosser et al . , 2010 , 2011 ) and Ste2 – GFP ( Alvaro et al . , 2014 ) . Briefly , cells were grown on selective medium for 16 - 24 h , dispersed on slides in SC medium and examined at room temperature using an Axiovert 200 inverted microscope ( Carl Zeiss , Munich ) equipped with a 100× , 1 . 4 NA Plan - Apochromat objective lens , an X - Cite 120 PC fluorescence illumination system , a Cooke Sensicam ( Cooke Corporation , Kelheim ) and SlideBook 5 software ( 3i , Denver , CO ) . For TIR - FM imaging of Sla1 – GFP and Abp1 – mCherry , slides ( prepared as above ) were viewed at room temperature using a 3i Marianas ™ system equipped with a 100× , 1 . 45 NA Plan - Fluar objective , dual EM charge - coupled device cameras ( Cascade II 512 , Photometrics , Tucson , AZ ) , 488 nm and 561 nm diode lasers and SlideBook 5 software . Simultaneous two - color images were acquired at 1 s intervals over 2 min , and kymographs were generated using the multiple kymograph ImageJ plugin ( http : / / www . embl - heidelberg . de / eamnet / html / kymograph . html ) . Mup1 – pHluorin internalization was tracked as described ( Prosser et al . , 2011 ) . Briefly , cells grown to mid - exponential phase in SC - Ura - Met were seeded onto concanavalin - A - coated 8 - well chamber slides ( Nunc ) at 30°C . Methionine was added to 20 µg / ml and the cells were viewed immediately and viewed again 30 min later . LatA treatment and washout experiments were performed using cells grown to mid - exponential phase in SC - Ura . Cells were collected and viewed before or after treatment with 200 µM LatA for 2 h ( BioMol , Hamburg , Germany ) in SC - Ura at 30°C . Cells were then pelleted at 8000 rpm in a microfuge , washed three times with SC - Ura , and grown foran additional 2 h at 30°C before imaging . Image acquisition parameters were constant within any experiment , allowing direct comparisons of fluorescence intensities ; identical maximum and minimum intensity values were applied using ImageJ . For pHluorin quantification , background was subtracted and whole - cell integrated density values were measured ( minimum of 40 cells per condition ) , normalized to cell size and expressed in arbitrary units ( a . u . ) for Ste3 – pHluorin or as a percentage of initial Mup1 internalized 30 min after methionine exposure . 4232 RESEARCH ARTICLE Journal of Cell Science ( 2015 ) 128 , 4220 - 4234 doi : 10 . 1242 / jcs . 175372 J o u r n a l o f C e ll S c i e n c e Four independent trials were performed for Mup1 experiments . Significance was assessed by one - way ANOVA , followed by Tukey ’ s multiple comparison analysis . Purification of a - factor pheromone and biossay of pheromone - induced growth arrest The a - factor pheromone was purified as described previously ( Sterne , 1989 ) . Briefly , BJ5459 cells ( Jones , 1991 ) containing pKK16 ( Kuchler et al . , 1989 ) , encoding MFA1 and STE6 for robust expression and secretion of a - factor , were grown to saturation in acid - washed glass flasks . The a - factor adheres to glass and was solubilized with n - propanol . Solubilized a - factor was concentrated by rotary evaporation , spotted onto sterile filter disks , and dried . Cellular response to a - factor - impregnated filters was monitored by an agar diffusion bioassay ( Kuchler et al . , 1989 ) . Approximately 1×10 5 MAT α sst2 Δ cells were plated in top agar , the disk containing a - factor was placed on the incipient lawn , cells were grown at 30°C for 2 - 6 days , and the resulting zone of growth inhibition ( halo ) was measured .
