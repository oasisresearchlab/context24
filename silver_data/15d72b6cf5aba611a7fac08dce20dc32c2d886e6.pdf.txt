The cellular response to stretching has been actively stud - ied . For example , stretching induces phosphorylation of the myosin regulatory light chain ( MRLC ) via the RhoA / RhoA - associated protein kinase ( ROCK ) pathway , resulting in in - creased cellular tension . In contrast , the effects of compressive stress on cellular functions are not fully resolved . The mechanisms for sensing and differentially responding to stretch - ing and compressive stress are not known . To address these questions , we investigated whether phosphorylation levels of MRLC were affected by compressive stress . Contrary to the response in stretching cells , MRLC was dephosphorylated 5 min after cells were sub - jected to compressive stress . Compressive loading induced activation of myosin phospha - tase mediated via the dephosphorylation of myosin phosphatase targeting subunit 1 ( Thr853 ) . Because myosin phosphatase targeting subunit 1 ( Thr853 ) is phosphorylated only by ROCK , compressive loading may have induced inactivation of ROCK . However , GTP - bound RhoA ( active form ) increased in response to compressive stress . The compres - sion - induced activation of RhoA and inactivation of its effector ROCK are contradictory . This inconsistency was due to phosphorylation of RhoA ( Ser188 ) that reduced affinity of RhoA to ROCK . Treatment with the inhibitor of protein kinase A that phosphorylates RhoA ( Ser188 ) induced suppression of compression - stimulated MRLC dephosphorylation . Inci - dentally , stretching induced phosphorylation of MRLC , but did not affect phosphorylation levels of RhoA ( Ser188 ) . Together , our results suggest that RhoA phosphorylation is an im - portant process for MRLC dephosphorylation by compressive loading , and for distinguish - ing between stretching and compressing cells .

The funders had no Introduction Tissues and cells in the human body are continually subjected to mechanical stress , such as compression , shear flow , and pressure . In order to maintain homeostasis in the body , it is nec - essary for cells to respond to mechanical stress . If cells cannot adequately respond to stress , the body will deteriorate into a pathological state . For example , vascular smooth muscle cells dilate and constrict in response to variations in blood pressure . High blood pressure causes an in - crease in blood flow and shear stress on vascular endothelial cells resulting in vascular damage . On the other hand , low blood pressure reduces blood circulation making it more difficult to provide nutrients and oxygen throughout the body . Therefore , in order to maintain constant blood flow , smooth muscle cells contract or dilate in response to high or low blood pressure [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] . Dysfunctional response to blood pressure induces several vascular diseases , such as hy - pertension [ 3 ] , chronic heart failure [ 4 ] and vasospastic angina [ 5 ] . Thus , elucidating the cellu - lar response to different mechanical stress in the human body is important for understanding various physiological events , including disease development . Mechanical stress that arises due to deformation of extracellular matrix ( ECM ) is divided broadly into two categories : stretch and compression . The cellular response to stretching cells has been widely studied . The intracellular factors sensing cell stretching are membrane - associ - ated proteins ( integrins [ 6 ] and cation channels [ 7 ] ) and cytoskeletons ( actin filaments [ 8 ] and microtubles [ 9 ] ) . Signaling pathways are activated by these factors , and cells respond through the production of extracellular matrix [ 10 ] , cell differentiation [ 11 ] , and increases in cellular elasticity [ 12 ] . On the other hand , cellular response to compressive loading are not well under - stood . It is also unclear which proteins can sense differences between stretching and compressing cells . Stretching cells also affects cellular tension force . Actin fibers , which are known as sensors of mechanical stress , exert traction force by interacting with myosin II . The tensional force is regulated by phosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chain ( MRLC ) at Thr18 and Ser19 , which stimulates the ATPase activity of myosin II [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] . The phosphorylation levels of MRLC are regulated by the balance between activities of some kinases and myosin light chain phosphatase ( MLCP ) . MLCP consists of three subunits , a catalytic subunit of the type 1 protein serine / threonine phosphatase family ( PP1 δ ) , a myosin phosphatase targeting subunit ( MYPT1 ) , and a 20 - kDa small subunit ( M20 ) [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] . MYPT1 is phosphorylated by ROCK , an effector of RhoA , and thereby inactivates MLCP [ 17 ] . After cells were forced to stretch , MRLC was phosphorylated via activation of RhoA and ROCK , and cells exerted stronger trac - tion forces [ 18 ] . However , it is unknown whether MRLC is phosphorylated or dephosphory - lated in response to compressive loading . In this study , we investigated how cells sense the differences between stretching and com - pression by examining the response of MRLC to compressive loading . We determined whether the levels of phosphorylated MRLC were changed in response to compressive loading using a previously developed device that compresses cells isotropically . As a result , MRLC was dephos - phorylated in response to compressive loading in contrast to the response of MRLC when stretching cells . The MRLC dephosphorylation response was induced by MLCP activation , MYPT1 dephosphorylation , and ROCK inactivation . Interestingly , compressive loading in - duced RhoA activation that was similar to the RhoA response to stretching cells . It was re - ported that the phosphorylation of RhoA ( Ser188 ) reduces the affinity of RhoA to ROCK [ 19 ] . Western blotting showed that RhoA was phosphorylated in response to compressive loading . In contrast , the phosphorylation levels of RhoA did not oscillate by stretching cells . The phos - phorylation of RhoA after compressing cells was induced by the adenylyl cyclase / protein kinase A ( PKA ) signaling pathway . These results suggest that the mechanisms that regulate cellular RhoA Phosphorylation by Compressive Loading PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0117937 March 3 , 2015 2 / 17 role in study design , data collection and analysis , decision to publish , or preparation of the manuscript . Competing Interests : The authors have declared that no competing interests exist . tension in response to variations in mechanical stress are controlled by the presence or absence of RhoA phosphorylation by PKA , but not activation or inactivation of RhoA . Materials and Methods Cell culture Murine C2C12 skeletal myoblast cells were obtained from the RIKEN Cell Bank ( Tsukuba , Japan ) . Cells were cultured in Dulbecco ’ s modified Eagle ’ s medium ( DMEM ; Sigma - Aldrich , MO , USA ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( BIST - TEC ; Equitech Bio Inc . , TX , USA ) and 1 % antibiotic solution ( Sigma - Aldrich ) at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5 % CO 2 . Reagents Protein phosphatase 1 and 2A inhibitor ( Calyculin A ) , protein kinase A inhibitor ( H - 89 ) , and adenylyl cyclase inhibitor ( SQ22 , 536 ) were purchased from Sigma - Aldrich . The following pri - mary antibodies were used for western blotting : myosin light chain 2 antibody ( # 3672 ; Cell Sig - naling Technology , MA , USA ) , phospho - myosin light chain 2 ( Ser19 ) antibody ( # 3671 ; Cell Signaling Technology ) , phospho - myosin light chain 2 ( Thr18 / Ser19 ) antibody ( # 3674 ; Cell Signaling Technology ) , myosin light chain 2 antibody ( # 3672 ; Cell Signaling Technology ) , GAPDH antibody ( # AM4300 ; Ambion , TX , USA ) , MYPT1 antibody ( # 2634 ; Cell Signaling Technology ) , phospho - MYPT1 ( Thr696 ) antibody ( # 5163 ; Cell Signaling Technology ) , phospho - MYPT1 ( Thr853 ) antibody ( # 4563 ; Cell Signaling Technology ) , RhoA antibody ( # ARH03 ; Cytoskeleton , CO , USA ) , and phospho - RhoA ( Ser188 ) antibody ( # AB41435 ; Abcam , Cambridge , UK ) . MRLC stained by phospho - myosin light chain 2 ( Ser19 ) antibody is denoted as 1P - MRLC , and MRLC stained by phospho - myosin light chain 2 ( Thr18 / Ser19 ) antibody is denoted as 2P - MRLC . Application of mechanical strain Cells were stretched or compressed isotropically using previously described methods [ 20 ] . The silicone chamber and steel ring were prepared , as shown Fig . 1A . The chamber is made of a transparent silicone rubber ( SH9555 ; Toray Dow Corning Silicone , Tokyo , Japan ) . For cell compression , the silicone chamber was pre - stretched by inserting the steel ring into the ditch of silicone . Myoblast cells were removed from the culture dishes using trypsin - EDTA , trans - ferred to the chamber , and cultured on pre - stretched silicone coated with 50 μ g / mL fibronec - tin . When the ring was pulled out of the ditch , the cells were compressed via the compression of the silicone chamber ( Fig . 1B ) . We observed that cell area was decreased 12 % immediately after cell compression ( S2C Fig . ) . In order to perform cell stretching , cells were cultured on the silicone chamber which was not pre - stretched , and then stretched by inserting the steel ring into the ditch of silicone ( Fig . 1C ) . The medium was replaced with DMEM containing 1 % FBS and 1 % antibiotic solution for 3 hours before applying mechanical strain . The cells were treated with the following inhibitors for 90 minutes before mechanical loading : 2 nM calyculin A ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , 30 μ M H - 89 ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , and 100 μ M SQ22 , 536 ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . Western blotting Cells were fixed in ice - cold trichloroacetic acid for 3 minutes and washed 3 times with PBS . Cell lysates were prepared in Laemmli sample buffer ( 0 . 25 M Tris - HCl , 5 % dithiothreitol , 2 . 3 % sodium dodecyl sulfate , 10 % glycerol , 0 . 01 % bromophenol blue , pH 8 . 8 ) . The proteins were then separated by SDS - PAGE using 7 . 5 % polyacrylamide gels ( for MYPT1 ) and 12 . 5 % ( for other proteins ) . After blocking ( 5 % skimmed milk in TBS - Tween 20 solution , 10 mM Tris - HCl RhoA Phosphorylation by Compressive Loading PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0117937 March 3 , 2015 3 / 17 containing 150 mM NaCl and 0 . 05 % Tween 20 , pH 7 . 5 ) , the blots were incubated at 4°C over - night with the appropriate primary antibody . After incubation with a secondary antibody ( HRP - conjugated anti - mouse or anti - rabbit IgG ) , the blots were developed using Can Get Sig - nal Immunoreaction Enhancer Solution ( Toyobo , Osaka , Japan ) . Protein levels of GAPDH were used as an internal standard . Western blots were quantified by Image J software ( National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MA ) . Observation of actin filaments To observe the dynamics of F - actin in cells under compressive loading , we performed live cell imaging . Semi - confluent C2C12 cells on a culture dish were transfected with a previously con - structed plasmid encoding azami green - tagged β - actin [ 21 ] and cultured for 1 day . The cells were removed from the culture plate using trypsin - EDTA , transferred onto the silicone cham - ber , and observed with a Nikon C1 confocal imaging system ( Nikon Instech . , Tokyo , Japan ) .

Cells were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 minutes , per - meabilized with 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 in PBS for 10 minutes . The samples were then blocked with 0 . 5 % BSA in PBS for 1 hour at room temperature , and incubated with MFP 488 - phalloidin for 1 hour at room temperature . We observed the samples after treatment with a fade - resistant so - lution ( 2 . 5 % DABCO , 90 % glycerol , 6 % PBS ; pH 8 . 0 ) . The resulting images were captured with a Nikon C1 confocal imaging system using the ×60 objective ( Nikon Instech . ) . Quantitative analysis of actin filament thickness The thickness of F - actin was quantitatively analyzed with a stress fiber thickness index ( SFTI ) [ 22 ] . In brief , immunofluorescent images of actin filaments were subjected to a minimum filter , which replaced each pixel in the image with the smallest pixel value in that pixel ’ s neighbor - hood . Fluorescence intensities on F - actin were gradually decreased by repeating minimum fil - tering . Actin filament intensity against the number of minimum filtering was fitted using the following equation : I ¼ A þ B (cid:2) exp (cid:3) N t (cid:1) (cid:3) where I is ﬂ uorescence intensity on a F - actin image , N is the number of the minimum ﬁ ltering , τ is the decay constant , and A and B are constants . The ﬂ uorescence intensity of thicker ﬁ bers decayed slower with ﬁ ltering ; thus , the decay constant was associated with actin ﬁ lament thickness . The decay constant τ was used as a SFTI . Images of phalloidin - stained actin ﬁ la - ments in 60 individual cells were randomly selected from 3 independent experiments and analyzed . RNA interference ( RNAi ) RNAi was used to knockdown the expression of the MYPT1 gene . The target sequence of the siRNA used in this study was 5 0 - CUGUGGAUAUCUCGAUAUUGC - 3 0 ( sense sequence ) . As a negative control , the following non - target sequence of the siRNA was randomly selected and used : 5 0 - ACUACAUGUCACAUCACGGUU - 3 0 ( sense sequence ) . Cells were transfected with siRNA duplexes using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX ( Invitrogen , CA , USA ) and were used for the designated assay after incubation for 2 days . The silencing efficiency was confirmed by western blotting . RhoA activation assay The Rho activity assay was performed and quantified using the RhoA Activation Assay Bio - chem Kit ( Cytoskeleton ) based on the Rhotekin pull - down assay . In brief , cells were washed with PBS then extracted using cell lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 10 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 5 M NaCl , 2 % Igepal ) . Samples were centrifuged for 5 minutes at 10 , 000 × g and then the superna - tant was incubated with Rhotekin - RBD beads for 1 . 5 hours at 4°C . After washing the beads with buffer ( 25 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 30 mM MgCl 2 , 40 mM NaCl ) , proteins were removed from the beads with Laemmli buffer , then subjected to western blotting . Statistical analysis Statistical analysis of the western blot data was performed using the Student ’ s t - test . Data is pre - sented as mean ± standard error of the mean ( SEM ) , and consists of 3 independent experiments . RhoA Phosphorylation by Compressive Loading PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0117937 March 3 , 2015 5 / 17 Results MRLC dephosphorylation in response to cell compression We examined whether the phosphorylation levels of myosin regulatory light chain ( MRLC ) in C2C12 cells changed after 12 % cell compression . In order to investigate time - dependent changes in MRLC phosphorylation , we analyzed mono - phosphorylated MRLC at Ser19 ( 1P - MRLC ) and di - phosphorylated MRLC at Thr18 and Ser19 ( 2P - MRLC ) by western blot at 0 . 5 , 1 , 3 , and 5 minutes after compression ( Fig . 2A ) . The levels of phosphorylated MRLC 5 minutes after compressive loading decreased relative to the control without compressive stress . To de - termine whether MRLC underwent continued dephosphorylation for more than 5 minutes after compressive loading , we detected phosphorylated MRLC at 5 , 15 , and 30 minutes after cell compression ( Fig . 2B ) . Similar to Fig . 2A , MRLC was dephosphorylated 5 minutes after cell compression . Fifteen minutes after compressive loading MRLC was more phosphorylated than at 5 minutes after cell compression . Furthermore , 15 minutes after cell compression the level of MRLC phosphorylation returned to the level reported before cell compression . Fig 2 . Phosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chain in response to compression . The phosphorylation levels of myosin regulatory light chain ( MRLC ) in C2C12 cells stimulated by 12 % compression was detected by western blotting . Mono - phosphorylated MRLC ( Ser19 ) is expressed as 1P - MRLC , and di - phosphorylated ( Thr18 / Ser19 ) is 2P - MRLC . Cells without compression were used as a control , and the compressed cells were analyzed at 0 . 5 , 1 , 3 , and 5 minutes ( A ) and 5 , 15 , and 30 minutes ( B ) after compression . The levels of 1P - MRLC , 2P - MRLC , MRLC and GAPDH were quantified with Image J software .

A previous study reported that F - actin disruption with cytochalasin D induced MRLC de - phosphorylation [ 23 ] ; therefore , we observed the behavior of actin filaments in cells expressing azami green - acitn ( Fig . 3A ) . Live cell imaging showed that F - actin was not disrupted after cell compression . Even without significant disruption of actin filaments , the thickness of actin fila - ments might change in response to compressive loading . The thickness of actin filaments was quantitatively assessed using immunofluorescent techniques ( Fig . 3B ) . Actin filament thickness was estimated by the stress fiber thickness index ( SFTI ) . SFTIs were not statistically different before or after compressive loading ( Fig . 3C ) . Thus , these results suggested that 12 % compres - sive stress did not affect F - actin dynamics . Compression induced MRLC dephosphorylation via activation of myosin light chain phosphatase Only one type of protein phosphatase ( PP ) , called myosin light chain phophatase ( MLCP ) , de - phosphorylates MRLC . We examined the role of MLCP in MRLC dephosphorylation as a Fig 3 . F - actin was unaffected by compressive stress .

The stress fiber thickness index was calculated from 3 independent experiments including 60 individual cells . The results were presented as mean ± SEM . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0117937 . g003 RhoA Phosphorylation by Compressive Loading PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0117937 March 3 , 2015 7 / 17 response to compressive loading . MLCP is composed of three subunits : a catalytic subunit ( protein phosphatase 1c δ , PP1c δ ) , a myosin binding regulatory subunit ( myosin phosphatase target subunit 1 , MYPT1 ) , and a subunit of unknown function ( p20 ) . First , the catalytic activity of MLCP was inhibited with calyculin A , a PP1 and PP2A inhibitor . Cells were treated with calyculin A ( 2 nM ) 90 minutes before compressive loading , and then we examined whether MRLC was dephosphorylated in response to compressive stress ( Fig . 4A ) . Accordingly , when compression was applied to cells under the treatment of calyculin A , MRLC was not dephos - phorylated . Next , MYPT1 , which is a subunit of MLCP was knocked down using RNAi ( Fig . 4B ) . As a result , compression did not induce MRLC dephosphorylation in cells transfected with MYPT1 siRNA . Thus , these results suggested that MLCP activity was involved in MRLC dephosphorylation in response to compression . Fig 4 . Compression induced inactivation of ROCK , and activated MLCP . ( A ) Influence of MLCP inhibition on phosphorylated MRLC under compressive stimulation . Cells were compressed 90 minutes after the treatment of calyculin A ( 2 nM ) .

( C ) Western blotting for phosphorylated MYPT1 under cell compression . MYPT1 ( Thr696 ) and MYPT1 ( Thr853 ) dephosphorylation 5 minutes after cell compression were detected by western blotting .

MYPT1 can bind to both MRLC and PP1c δ [ 24 ] , [ 25 ] . MYPT1 facilitates the specific activity of PP1c δ in the dephosphorylation of phospho - MRLC by tethering the catalytic subunit to MRLC . Thr694 and / or Thr852 at MYPT1 can be phos - phorylated . Phospho - MYPT1 is also a target of PP1c δ , and lowers substrate specificity of PP1c δ to MRLC [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] , [ 28 ] . Additionally , phosphorylation of MYPT1 ( Thr852 ) interferes with the binding of MYPT1 to MRLC [ 29 ] . For these reasons , phosphorylation of MYPT1 inac - tivates MLCP . In contrast , blockage of MYPT1 phosphorylation induces MLCP activation . MYPT1 mutants ( Thr694Ala and Thr852Ala ) mimick the un - phosphorylated state , can en - hance MLCP activity and decreases the levels of phosphorylated MRLC compared to wild type MYPT1 [ 30 ] . Because MLCP was activated after cell compression , we hypothesized that these MYPT1 sites are dephosphorylated in response to compressive loading . We examined the phosphorylation levels of MYPT1 ( Fig . 4C ) . MYPT1 ( Thr852 ) was significantly dephosphory - lated after cell compression , whereas MYPT1 ( Thr694 ) was not . These findings indicate that compression activated MLCP via MYPT1 ( Thr852 ) dephosphorylation , which resulted in the dephosphorylation of MRLC . The Thr694 site of MYPT1 is phosphorylated by various kinases : ROCK , ZIPK , ILK , and PAK [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] , [ 28 ] . On the other hand , the Thr852 site of MYPT1 is phosphorylated only by ROCK [ 26 ] . Taken together , it may be suspected that ROCK was inac - tivated by compressive stress . RhoA activation and phosphorylation by compressive loading It was deduced that ROCK was inactivated in response to compressive loading . We examined whether compression induced inactivation of RhoA , which up - regulates ROCK . An immuno - precipitation technique with Rhotekin - RBD beads was used to detect the levels of RhoA - GTP ( active RhoA ) before and after cell compression . Interestingly , active RhoA was increased 1 minute after compressive stress ( Fig . 5A ) . Here , there was a discrepancy between inactivated ROCK and activated RhoA after compression . Nusser et al . reported that when RhoA is phos - phorylated at the Ser188 site , it cannot interact and activate ROCK [ 19 ] . We hypothesized that RhoA was phosphorylated in response to cell compression . Western blot results showed that RhoA ( Ser188 ) was significantly phosphorylated 5 minutes after compressive loading ( Fig . 5B ) . Adenylyl cyclase / PKA signaling regulated MRLC dephosphorylation response It has been reported that RhoA ( Ser188 ) is phosphorylated by protein kinase A ( PKA ) [ 31 ] . We investigated the contribution of RhoA phosphorylation by PKA to the MRLC dephosphor - ylation response . First , we examined the efffects of PKA inhibitor H - 89 on the phosphorylation levels of RhoA . Cells on a plastic dish were treated with H - 89 at a concentration of 30 μ M for 90 minutes , and then , phosphorylation levels of RhoA was decreased by H - 89 treatment ( Fig . 5C ) . Next , we investigated the efects of the treatment of H - 89 on compressive - induced RhoA phosphorylation and MRLC dephosphorylation . Cells on a silicone rubber were treated with H - 89 ( 30 μ M ) 90 minutes before compressive loading . PKA inhibitor H - 89 resulted in blockage of RhoA phosphorylation in response to cell compression ( Fig . 5D ) . Additionally , there was no significant difference between the levels of phosphorylated MRLC in cells with and without compression when treated with PKA inhibitor ( Fig . 5D ) . Therefore , these results suggest that RhoA phosphorylation induced by PKA leads to MRLC dephosphorylation in re - sponse to compressive loading . The activity of PKA is dependent on intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( cAMP ) concentration [ 32 ] . cAMP is synthesized from adenosine triphosphate by adenylyl cyclase [ 33 ] .

( C ) Effects of protein kinase A ( PKA ) inhibitor H - 89 or adenylyl cyclase inhibitor SQ22 , 536 on phosphorylated RhoA Phosphorylation by Compressive Loading PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0117937 March 3 , 2015 10 / 17 To examine whether inhibition of adenylyl cyclase suppresses MRLC dephosphorylation in re - sponse to compressive loading , we initially investigated the effects of adenylyl cyclase inhibitor ( SQ22 , 536 ) on the phosphorylation levels of RhoA . When cells were treated with 100 μ M SQ22 , 536 for 90 minutes , levels of phosphorylated RhoA were decreased ( Fig . 5C ) . We subse - quently investigated the effects of the inhibition of adenylyl cyclases on compressive - induced RhoA phosphorylation and MRLC dephosphorylation . Cells on a silicone rubber were treated with SQ22 , 536 ( 100 μ M ) 90 minutes before compressive loading . Under the treatment of SQ22 , 536 , phosphorylation levels of RhoA were decreased rather than remaining unchanged by compressive loading ( Fig . 5E ) . Moreover , inhibition of adenylyl cyclase blocked compres - sion - stimulated MRLC dephosphorylation ( Fig . 5E ) . These results suggest that the adenylyl cy - clase / cAMP / PKA signaling pathway is involved in MRLC dephosphorylation response to compression . Stretching cells cannot induce phosphorylation of RhoA The deformation stress opposite to compressive loading is cell stretching . The cellular response to stretching also contrasts the response to cell compression . For example , MRLC was phos - phorylated via ROCK activation after fibroblast cells were subjected to stretching [ 18 ] . We con - firmed that stretching induced MRLC phosphorylation in C2C12 cells as well ( S1A Fig . ) . On the other hand , we found that the RhoA response to stretching was consistent with the re - sponse to compressive stress . We investigated the RhoA activity 5 minutes after C2C12 cells were stretched . Then RhoA was activated by stretching cells ( S1B Fig . ) . Combined with the re - sult that RhoA activation was induced by compressive loading , RhoA was activated in response to both stretching and compressing stress . In other words , it suggests that RhoA cannot distin - guish stretching cells from compressive loading . We hypothesized that MRLC dephosphoryla - tion response to cell compression as distinguished from stretching was caused by RhoA phosphorylation , but not due to change in RhoA activity . Western blotting for phosphorylated RhoA was used to examine whether phosphorylated RhoA changed in response to stretching cells . There was no significant difference in RhoA phosphorylation between stretched and unstretched cells ( S1C Fig . ) . Therefore , RhoA phosphorylation may be the means by which MRLC can discriminate between stretched and compressed cells . Discussion In this study , we obtained the following results . ( 1 ) Myosin regulatory light chain ( MRLC ) was dephosphorylated in C2C12 cells subjected to compressive loading . ( 2 ) MRLC dephosphoryla - tion in response to cell compression was induced by MLCP activation via MYPT1 ( Thr853 ) de - phosphorylation . ( 3 ) Compression may induce ROCK inactivation despite RhoA activation . ( 4 ) The MRLC dephosphorylation response was due to RhoA phosphorylation through the adenylyl cyclase / protein kinase A signaling pathway . Fig . 6 is the signaling pathway summariz - ing the results suggested in the present work . Additionally , we hypothesize that RhoA RhoA ( Ser188 ) .

The finding that MRLC was dephosphorylated in response to compressive loading is thought to influence cell density . Keeping the cell density constant can help control tissue and organ size , and aberration of this system can trigger cancer development and other diseases . An increase in cell density due to excess cell division causes compressive stress on the cells themselves . In order to reduce the excessive cell density , cells must stop proliferating . Recently , it was reported that cells on a stiffer extracellular matrix ( ECM ) activate Yes - associated protein ( YAP ) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ - binding motif ( TAZ ) , which promotes cell proliferation and cell survival [ 34 ] . YAP / TAZ activation in response to ECM stiffness was me - diated by MRLC phosphorylation . Thus , the MRLC dephosphorylation response to compres - sion may inhibit cell proliferation signaling via YAP / TAZ . This suggestion is supported by the report that DNA synthesis scaled directly with projected cell area : cells on a small adhesive is - land coated with fibronectin showed low ability of cell proliferation and survival [ 35 ] . Addi - tionally , George T . Eisenhoffer reported that increased density in MDCK cells was de - escalated through apical extrusion of cells and returned to the constant cell area [ 36 ] . Suspension of cell division through YAP / TAZ inactivation and apical extrusion of cells by compressive loading may regulate cell density in vivo . We considered the effect of compressive loading on cell area . Cells can control their own size , and regulate their cell area to keep it constant . For example , immediately following cell Fig 6 . Proposed model for compression - induced dephosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chain ( MRLC ) . In C2C12 cells subjected to compressive loading , RhoA and adenylyl cyclase activation were induced . Adenylyl cyclase activation may activate protein kinase A ( PKA ) via cAMP production . RhoA phosphorylation by PKA induces decreasing affinity of RhoA for ROCK and inactivates ROCK [ 19 ] . Myosin phosphatase target subunit 1 ( MYPT1 ) at Thr852 which is kinase substrate of ROCK is dephosphorylated . Accordingly , myosin phosphatase ( MLCP ) is activated and dephosphorylates MRLC . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0117937 . g006 RhoA Phosphorylation by Compressive Loading PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0117937 March 3 , 2015 12 / 17 division cells are very small , and then gradually grow to the size of their parent cell [ 37 ] . We ex - amined how cell size changes in response to compressive loading when cells are forced to de - crease in size . As a result , cells gradually grew to a large size after compressive stress and returned to their original size 20 minutes after cell compression ( S2A Fig . ) . Initially , we thought that increasing cell size after compressive loading was due to MRLC dephosphorylation . How - ever , cell area is regulated by cellular tension , which is dependent on the phosphorylation of MRLC , and time - dependent change of phosphorylated MRLC in response to compressive loading is correlated with the change in traction force during cell spreading [ 38 ] . Therefore , we investigated the cell area of cells that were compressed under the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase , which is important in the MRLC dephosphorylation response to compression . However , cells under the treatment of adenylyl cyclase inhibitor also return to their original size after com - pressive loading along with the non - treated cells ( S2B , C Fig . ) . Thus , these results suggested that MRLC dephosphorylation by cell compression may not be necessary to regulate cell area . Cell spreading is promoted by protrusion of membrane ruffles . Rho GTPases is implicated in the formation of actin filamients in membrane protrusion . A recent study showed that Rac1 , which is one of the RhoGTPases , was essential for cell migration , but not for cell spreading [ 39 ] . On the other hand , RhoA is involved not only in contractile force generation by ROCK , but also membrane protrusion by mDia1 . Using a FRET technique , it was reported that RhoA was activated 40 seconds before Rac1 activation in lamellipodia formation [ 40 ] . Therefore , the RhoA / mDia1 signaling pathway may be related to reconstruction of cell area after compressive loading . Based on Fig . 3 , we concluded that compressive loading did not induce collapse or thickness change of actin filaments . However , actin particles with approximately 0 . 5 μ m diameter were observed after cell compression ( Fig . 3B ) . There are three conceivable causes why the actin par - ticles were generated . ( i ) Cortical thinner actin filaments may be disrupted . Hayakawa et al . re - ported that actin - severing protein cofilin selectively bind to unstrained actin fibers [ 41 ] . Since compressive loading decreased tension of actin fibers , enabling binding of cofilin to the the actin fibers and sebsequently severing them . Although disruption of actin fibers was not ob - served with live - cell imaging , observable actin fibers using this technique are thick bundles of actin filaments called stress fibers . Thus , thinner cortical actin filaments may be disrupted by cofilin , so that actin particles increased after cell compression . ( ii ) The actin particles are possi - bly the nucleus of actin polymerization . Compressive loading induced RhoA activation and can activate mDia1 . mDia1 can stabilize actin dimers and trimers that are intermediates of actin polymerization [ 42 ] . Profilin interacts with mDia1 and recruits the actin monomers to the actin nucleus , therefore , actin filaments are elongated [ 43 ] . RhoA activation by compressive stress might induce activation of mDia1 , resulting in nucleation of actin polymerization . ( iii ) The particles may be endosomes and exosomes . Endocytosis and exocytosis regulate not only composition and surface area , but also tension of cellular membranes . Endocytosis increases membrane tension by removing excess membrane components , whereas exocytosis relaxes the cell membrane . In this study , compressive loading decreased cellular membrane tension . In order to maintain the plasma membrane tension , endocytosis may be stimulated after cell com - pression . Additionally , clathrin - mediated endocytosis is associated with the actin cytoskeleton . Actin dynamics is required for membrane invagination and clathrin - mediated plaque uptake [ 44 ] . Actin and some of its interacting proteins ( Arp2 / 3 , cortactin , Hip1R etc . ) are recruited to clathrin - containing structures upon scission from the plasma membrane [ 45 ] , [ 46 ] . Hence , it would not be surprising if endocytosis was activated by change in the tension of the actin cyto - skeleton after cell compression . In this study , RhoA was activated after induction of compressive stimuli . Furthermore , a previous study revealed that stretching cells also induced RhoA activation [ 18 ] . In summary , RhoA Phosphorylation by Compressive Loading PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0117937 March 3 , 2015 13 / 17 cells cannot sense differences between compressing and stretching cells in terms of RhoA activ - ity . Some guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEF ) , which are activators for RhoA , are known to respond to mechanical stress . For example , LARG and GEF - H1 were activated in re - sponse to generate tensile forces on fibronectin - coated magnet beads attached to the dorsal sur - face of cells [ 47 ] . Vav - 2 which can exchange GDP for GTP on several Rho - GTPases including RhoA , Rac1 , RhoG , and Cdc42 responded to fluid shear flow and ECM stiffness [ 48 ] , [ 49 ] . Al - ternatively , p190RhoGEF [ 50 ] and PDZRhoGEF [ 51 ] , also known as RhoGEFs , were activated by mechanical stress . These RhoGEFs may sense compressive stress and activate RhoA . This study reported that adenylyl cyclase was involved with MRLC dephosphorylation in re - sponse to compressing cells . Ten types of adenylyl cyclases have been found , of which eight types are expressed in mouse . Adenylyl cyclase activity is altered by some agents . All adenylyl cyclase isozymes are stimulated by forskolin [ 52 ] , seven types are regulated by protein kinase A and C [ 53 ] , and three types are activated by Ca 2 + or calmodulin [ 54 ] . Additionally , cytoskele - ton disruption also enhanced some adenylyl cyclases [ 55 ] . A previous study revealed that ade - nylyl cyclase type 6 , which is activated only by forskolin , was mechanoresponsive factor that increased inside the cells in response to shear stress [ 56 ] . However , it has not been reported that compression induced forskolin products or increased intracellular Ca 2 + . We did not ob - serve collapse of actin fibers ( Fig . 2 ) or an increase in intracellular Ca 2 + after compressive load - ing to cells ( data not shown ) . Further work is needed to investigate which adenylyl cyclases are activated in response to compressive loading . Lastly , we note the specificity of the PKA inhibitor H - 89 . H - 89 is currently used as a selec - tive and potent inhibitor of protein kinase A ( PKA ) . However , Davies et al . reported that H - 89 inhibits at least eight kinases except for PKA [ 57 ] . It is also noted that ROCK is included in the kinases targeted by H - 89 . Thus , inhibition of other kinases excluding PKA ( especially ROCK ) may affect dephosphorylation of MRLC in response to compressive loading . Nevertheless , H - 89 blocked phosphorylation of RhoA after cell compression . Within the targets of H - 89 , the only kinase that can regulate phosphorylation levels of RhoA is PKA . It was reported that phos - phorylation of RhoA induces ROCK inactivation and affects the phosphorylation levels of MRLC [ 58 ] . Additionally , SQ22 , 536 also prevented RhoA phosphorylation and MRLC dephos - phorylation in response to compressive loading . SQ22 , 536 inhibits some adenylyl cyclases , which results in inhibition of cAMP formation and PKA activity . Hence , we concluded that the adenylyl cyclase / cAMP / PKA signaling pathway is involved in compression - induced MRLC dephosphorylation . Supporting Information S1 Fig .
