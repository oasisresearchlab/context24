( Received October 2 , 2016 ; Accepted November 8 , 2016 ) Pollen germination is an essential step towards successful pollination during maize reproduction . How low niutrogen ( N ) affects pollen germination remains an interesting biolo - gical question to be addressed . We found that only low N resulted in a signiﬁcantly lower germination rate of pollen grains after 4 weeks of low N , phosphorus or potassium treatment in maize production . Importantly , cytological analysis showed 7 - fold more micronuclei in male meiocytes under the low N treatment than in the control , indicating that the lower germination rate of pollen grains was partially due to numerous chromosome loss events resulting from preceding meiosis . The appearance of 10 bivalents in the control and low N cells at diakinesis suggested that chromo - some pairing and recombination in meiosis I was not af - fected by low N . Further gene expression analysis revealed dramatic down - regulation of Nuclear Division Cycle 80 ( Ndc80 ) and Regulator of Chromosome Condensation 1 ( Rcc1 - 1 ) expression and up - regulation of Cell Division Cycle 20 ( Cdc20 - 1 ) expression , although no signiﬁcant dif - ference in the expression level of kinetochore foundation proteins Centromeric Histone H3 ( Cenh3 ) and Centromere Protein C ( Cenpc ) and cohesion regulators Recombination 8 ( Rec8 ) and Shugoshin ( Sgo1 ) was observed . Aberrant modu - lation of three key meiotic regulators presumably resulted in a high likelihood of erroneous chromosome segregation , as testiﬁed by pronounced lagging chromosomes at anaphase I or cell cycle disruption at meiosis II . Thus , we proposed a cytogenetic mechanism whereby low N affects male meiosis and causes a higher chromosome loss frequency and even - tually a lower germination rate of pollen grains in a staple crop plant .

Introduction Maize is a major cereal crop that makes a principal contribution to global food security . As a constituent of numerous import - ant compounds including proteins , nucleic acids and plant hor - mones , nitrogen ( N ) is one of the three macronutrients required for maize growth , development and grain formation ( Novoa and Loomis 1981 , Uhart and Andrade 1995a , Lam et al . 1996 ) . Although millions of tons of N fertilizers are applied in the ﬁeld across the world , low N remains a major limiting factor for maize production in many areas ( Sanchez 2002 , Fageria and Baligar 2005 ) . For example , a majority of crop ﬁelds suffer from N insufﬁciency in Africa where millions of hungry people await the supply of food ( Giller et al . 1997 , Sanchez , 2002 ) . Even in China , approximately one - third of ﬁelds do not have a sufﬁcient N supply , especially in western China ( Zhang et al . 2008 ) . In addition , N availability in the ﬁeld can be affected by other factors . For example , N availability is closely related to water availability . Low N supply accompanied by drought has become a serious nutritional problem in crop production due to fre - quent seasonal drought ( Eck 1984 , Bingham 1966 , Saini and Aspinall 1981 , Denning et al . 2009 , Lobell et al . 2011 ) . N insuf - ﬁciency reduces leaf photosynthetic capacities , biomass accu - mulation and carbon allocation to reproductive organs in maize ( Below et al . 1981 , Ding et al . 2005 ) . N stress particularly decreases ear size and the number of grains and tassel ﬂorets ; however , the underlying cytogenetic mechanisms remain poorly understood ( Uhart and Andrade 1995a , Uhart and Andrade 1995b , Liao et al . 2012 ) . Pollen development in the anther takes place in two major phases , namely microsporogenesis and microgametogenesis ( McCormick 2004 , Borg et al . 2009 ) . During microsporogenesis , microsporocytes successively undergo meiosis I and meiosis II to produce tetrads of haploid microspores . After entering microgametogenesis , microspores sequentially go through two rounds of mitosis , and gradually develop into trinucleate pollen grains ( McCormick 2004 , Borg et al . 2009 ) . Pollen genesis involves reductional chromosome segregation during micro - sporogenesis , an accurate cytogenetic process tightly regulated by many critical regulators with highly conserved functions Plant Cell Physiol . 58 ( 2 ) : 342 – 353 ( 2017 ) doi : 10 . 1093 / pcp / pcw195 , Advance Access publication on 15 November 2016 , available online at www . pcp . oxfordjournals . org !

Recombination 8 ( REC8 ) is a foundation component of the cohesin complex that holds sister chromatids together , and Shugoshin ( SGO ) protects REC8 from phosphorylation and en - sures stepwise cohesin release in meiosis ( Stoop - Myer and Amon 1999 , Watanabe and Nurse 1999 , Kitajima et al . 2004 , Rabitsch et al . 2004 , Hamant et al . 2005 , Golubovskaya et al . 2006 , Lee et al . 2008 , Shao et al . 2011 ) . Mutation of either Rec8 or Sgo1 causes premature separation of sister chromatids and results in severe chromosome mis - segregation . Centromeric Histone H3 ( CENH3 ) and Centromere Protein C ( CENPC ) are kinetochore foundation proteins essential for centromere and kinetochore functioning ( Dawe et al . 1999 , Zhong et al . 2002 , Cheeseman and Desai 2008 ) . Nuclear Division Cycle 80 ( NDC80 ) is a crucial kinetochore protein required for faithful chromosome segregation ( Wigge et al . 1998 , He et al . 2001 , Wei et al . 2005 , Cheeseman et al . 2006 ) : ( i ) it directly interacts with the Mini - chromosome Instability 12 ( MIS12 ) complex and forms a visible MIS12 – NDC80 bridge between sister kineto - chores to ensure co - orientation of sister kinetochores during meiosis I ( Cheeseman and Desai 2008 , Li and Dawe 2009 ) ; ( ii ) it , together with three other biochemically associated kinetochore proteins , constitutes a four - subunit complex that directly links the core kinetochore with highly dynamic microtubules for stable chromosome – spindle associations ( Wigge and Kilmartin 2001 , McCleland et al . 2004 , DeLuca et al . 2006 , Joglekar et al . 2006 , Wei et al . 2007 , Powers et al . 2009 , Alushin et al . 2010 ) ; ( iii ) it may serve as a docking site for Aurora B kinase that plays important roles in kinetochore orientation and connection to microtubules by correcting in - correct chromosome – microtubule interactions before the cell cycle proceeds ( Tanaka et al . 2002 , Lampson et al . 2004 , Monje - Casas et al . 2007 , Alushin et al . 2010 , Meyer et al . 2013 ) ; and ( iv ) it is an essential player in the spindle assembly checkpoint as a necessary loading pad for Mps1 kinase and Mad1 / Mad2 com - plexes ( Martin - Lluesma et al . 2002 , DeLuca et al . 2003 , Kemmler et al . 2009 ) . MIS12 was identiﬁed as a central kinetochore com - ponent required for equal chromosome segregation ( Goshima et al . 1999 , Goshima et al . 2003 , Sato et al . 2005 , Kline et al . 2006 , Afreen and Varma , 2015 ) , and it ensures mono - orientation of sister kinetochores and reductional chromosome segregation during meiosis I in maize ( Li and Dawe 2009 ) . Loss of function of either Ndc80 or Mis12 causes severe chromosome mis - segrega - tion and aneuploidy . Regulator of Chromosome Condensation 1 ( RCC1 ) , a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that mediates Ran - GTP generation , binds to chromatin for proper spindle assembly and functioning via N - terminal phosphorylation and methylation ( Bischoff and Ponstingl 1991 , Carazo - Salas et al . 1999 , Moore et al . 2002 , Li and Zheng , 2004 , Chen et al . 2007 , Makde et al . 2010 , Halpin et al . 2011 ) . Impairment of RCC1 phosphorylation or methylation leads to defective spin - dle assembly and abnormal chromosome segregation . Cell Division Cycle 20 ( CDC20 ) regulates chromosome segregation at anaphase onset by binding to and activating the APC / C ( Anaphase Promoting Complex / Cyclosome ) complex for de - struction of securin ( Visintin et al . 1997 , Lim et al . 1998 , Jallepalli et al . 2001 , Peters , 2006 ) . Chromosomes then move to opposite poles following proteolytic cleavage of chromatid cohesin ( Uhlmann et al . 2000 , Waizenegger et al . 2000 , Petronczki et al . 2003 ) . Pollen genesis and germination are two essential steps to - wards successful pollination in maize . It is well known that pollen genesis and functioning are extremely vulnerable to en - vironmental stresses , and that pollen viability is dramatically reduced under various abiotic stresses such as drought , cold , high temperature and micronutrient deﬁciencies ( Herrero and Johnson 1980 , Dell 1981 , Saini and Aspinall 1981 , Sharma et al . 1990 , Sharma et al . 1991 , Young et al . 2004 , Tang et al . 2011 ) . For example , water insufﬁciency at the meiotic stage leads to pollen sterility in wheat , barley , rice and maize ( Zavadskaya and Skazkin 1960 , Saini and Aspinall 1981 , Sheoran and Saini 1996 , Zhuang et al . 2007 ) . Drought or cold stress cause high frequencies of cell sterility during tetrad separation and uni - nucleate microspore formation in wheat and rice ( Oliver et al . 2005 , Ji et al . 2010 ) . In sorghum , cold stress increases the male sterility rate by disrupting pollen mother cell formation and cell cycle progression to the leptotene stage in meiosis I ( Brooking 1976 ) . However , effects of macronutrient deﬁciencies on pollen genesis and germination and in particular the underlying cyto - genetic and molecular mechanisms are not well understood . Here , we investigated how macronutrient deﬁciencies affected pollen genesis and germination and showed that only low N signiﬁcantly reduced the germination rate of pollen grains in maize . We further showed that such lower pollen germination rates under N insufﬁciency were partially attributed to aberrant meiotic modulation during pollen genesis . Results Low N signiﬁcantly lowered the germination rate of pollen grains of maize plants Pollen viability is a key factor in determining pollination efﬁ - ciency . To analyze pollen viability , we pre - tested three different approaches including the iodine – potassium iodide method , the triphenyl tetrazolium chloride method and the in vitro germin - ation method , and found that the third method is the most consistent ( Wang et al . 2010 ) . We slightly modiﬁed the pollen germination in vitro method and carefully controlled experi - mental conditions to analyze the pollen germination rate as described in the Materials and Methods . N , phosphorus ( P ) and potassium ( K ) are three essential macronutrients for plant growth , development and grain formation ( Marschner 1995 ) . To determine whether they are essential for pollen ger - mination , we separately grew maize plants with N , P or K limi - tation . After 4 weeks of treatment , only low N caused a statistically signiﬁcant reduction ( P < 0 . 01 ) in the germination rate of pollen grains . On average , an approximately 20 % de - crease in the germination rate ( 61 ± 6 . 4 % , n = 642 for low N plants and 81 ± 6 . 7 % , n = 675 for N - sufﬁcient plants ) was observed under the low N condition ( Fig . 1A ) . Thus , N limita - tion had a larger negative effect on pollen germination com - pared with P or K limitation under our experimental conditions . Although most leaves remained green in most plants at the 343 Plant Cell Physiol . 58 ( 2 ) : 342 – 353 ( 2017 ) doi : 10 . 1093 / pcp / pcw195 early reproductive stage , premature leaf senescence occurred on the low N - treated plants ( Fig . 1C ) , strongly suggesting com - prehensive negative effects of low N on plant growth . We fur - ther self - crossed maize plants and found surprisingly fewer kernels on the low N - treated maize ear at harvest ( 110 ± 40 kernels per low - N ear vs . 280 ± 30 kernels per N - sufﬁcient ear ) ( Supplementary Fig . S1 ) , indicating the yield loss due to insufﬁcient N acquisition . Indeed , the female parent primarily determined the kernel number when excessive pollen grains were applied , as indicated by 114 ± 35 kernels per low - N ear crossed with N - sufﬁcient pollen vs . 277 ± 31 kernels per N - suf - ﬁcient ear crossed with low - N pollen . Similarly , the low - N ear had 107 ± 42 kernels when outcrossed with low - N pollen , and the N - sufﬁcient ear had approximately 2 - fold more kernels ( 275 ± 36 ) when outcrossed with N - sufﬁcient pollen . Numerous micronuclei were observed in haploid cells in tetrads under the low N condition In an effort to better understand how low N reduced the ger - mination rate of maize pollen , we analyzed the frequency of micronuclei in tetrads , which is a distinctive cytological feature indicative of pollen abortion and low germination rates ( Hassold and Hunt 2001 , Huang et al . 2008 ) . Anthers containing tetrads were preferentially selected for cell extrusion , slide prep - aration , 4 0 , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI ) staining , and micronucleus capture and quantiﬁcation under the ﬂuores - cence microscope . We pre - examined micronucleus frequencies in tetrads in low N , P or K plants , and only found signiﬁcantly more micronuclei in low N tetrads than in control tetrads ( Supplementary Fig . S2 ) , consistent with the signiﬁcant nega - tive effect of low N on pollen germination ( Fig . 1A ) . Thereafter , we focused all cytological and molecular work on low N - treated plants . As shown in Fig . 2 B and C , we observed more tetrads with micronuclei in low N - treated plants . Quantiﬁcation ana - lysis showed that the micronucleus frequency ( 2 . 75 ± 0 . 38 % ; n = 6 , 158 ) of low N plants was seven times that of the control ( 0 . 38 ± 0 . 03 % ; n = 10 , 439 ) ( Fig . 2C ) , indicating severe disruption of meiotic chromosome segregation by the low N stress during pollen formation . We ﬁrst checked bivalent formation at dia - kinesis and did not ﬁnd univalents in the control ( Fig . 2D ; n = 350 ) and low N cells ( Fig . 2E ; n = 395 ) . To better reveal how low N affected chromosome segregation , MIS12 antibodies ( Li and Dawe 2009 ) were used to mark kinetochores and track chromosome segregation during meiosis . At meiosis I , each pair of sister kinetochores co - orient in parallel with or along with the metaphase plate during late prometaphase for proper chromosome alignment ; at metaphase I , all sister kinetochores align perfectly into two lines , ensuring each pair of sister kin - etochores has monopolar spindle attachment for homologous chromosome segregation upon onset of anaphase ( Petronczki et al . 2003 , Li and Dawe 2009 ) . Any kinetochore alignment along the spindle axis between two lines of sister kinetochores at metaphase I indicates abnormal bi - orientation of sister kin - etochores and their bipolar attachment , which inevitably leads to chromosome mis - segregation ( Li and Dawe 2009 ) . Interestingly , rather than parallel alignment of most MIS12 signals along the metaphase plate ( Fig . 3B , C ) , some signals showed linear alignment along the spindle axis ( Fig 3E , F ) as previously characterized in the maize Mis12 RNAi ( RNA inter - ference ) mutant plants ( Li and Dawe 2009 ) , indicating that low N caused bi - orientation of sister kinetochores during meta - phase I . Most importantly , pronounced lagging chromosomes or chromosome bridges occurred at anaphase I in low N mei - otic cells ( Fig . 3J – R ) . Such types of errors were observed in 21 cells out of 402 anaphase I cells from three low N plants , and only one cell had chromosome mis - segregation when examin - ing 421 anaphase I cells in three N - sufﬁcient plants . In meiosis II , segregation of sister chromatids was delayed or arrested ( Fig . 4D – F ) : two sets of chromatids migrated opposite to the spindle pole in one telophase II cell ; while chromosomes in the coupling cell , rather than aligning along the metaphase plate or separat - ing , instead moved peripherally to the cell corner . Sometimes , multiple nuclei , rather than four symmetric nuclei , initiated approaching the end of meiosis II ( Fig . 4G – I ) .

Zheng et al . | Aberrant meiotic modulation affects pollen germination meiotic II cells from three low N plants , and only three cells with segregation errors out of 613 meiotic II cells in three N - sufﬁ - cient plants . All these cytogenetic errors were like those observed in the maize Mis12 RNAi mutant plants ( Li and Dawe 2009 ) and may result in differentially sized micronuclei during gametogenesis ( Fig . 5D – L ) . Each MIS12 signal repre - sented the kinetochore or centromere structure ( Li and Dawe 2009 ) and indicated that those micronuclei were derived from chromosome loss events ( Fig . 5D – L ) . Variations in the size of the micronuclei may be associated with the scale of chromo - some loss or breakage ; while variations in the distance between the micronucleus and the main nucleus largely depended on complicated chromosome dynamics during ‘illegal’ movements ( Fig . 5D – L ) . Chromosome mis - segregation and micronucleus formation consequently interfered with normal pollen forma - tion and reduced the germination rate of mature pollen grains in low N plants . Notably , only micronuclei derived from a large chromosome segment or an entire chromosome were detected , and smaller micronuclei were not detectable in this analysis , which underestimated the cytogenetic error frequency . Differential regulation of expression of key meiotic regulators Chromosome misorientation and mis - segregation occurs once cohesion is interfered with ( Petronczki et al . 2003 ) . REC8 and SGO are two key components which establish and maintain chromosome cohesion during cell division ( Stoop - Myer and Amon 1999 , Watanabe and Nurse 1999 , Kitajima et al . 2004 ) . To rule out the possibility of cohesion defects during chromosome mis - segregation and micronucleus formation under the low N condition , we analyzed the expression levels of ZmRec8 and ZmSgo1 in anthers of the control and low N plants and found no signiﬁcant difference between the two groups ( Fig . 6A , B ) . Thus , REC8 – SGO1 - mediated cohesion might function properly in meiosis during pollen formation , or have no relationship to severe cytological and developmen - tal defects including chromosome mis - segregation and micro - nucleus formation at the transcription level in this study . The kinetochore plays pivotal roles in mediating chromosome segregation ( Yu et al . 2000 ) . Speciﬁcally , CENH3 and CENPC are inner kinetochore proteins essential for kinetochore assembly and functioning ( Cheeseman and Desai 2008 ) . Kinetochore pro - tein MIS12 is required for co - orientation of sister kinetochores during meiosis I in maize ( Li and Dawe 2009 ) , and participates in spindle assembly and proper chromosome segregation in mitosis ( Goshima et al . 1999 , Goshima et al . 2003 ) . NDC80 serves as a contact point for chromosome – spindle interaction ( Joglekar et al . 2006 , Wei et al . 2007 , Powers et al . 2009 , Alushin et al . 2010 ) . If cohesion was unaffected under N limitation , chromo - some mis - segregation that we observed in low N meiotic cells may be derived from kinetochore defects . We thus analyzed ex - pression levels of Cenh3 , Cenpc , Mis12 and Ndc80 between low N and control treatments . Cenh3 and Cenpc expression remained at a similar level to the control ( Fig . 6C , D ) . Unexpectedly , Mis12 expression was signiﬁcantly enhanced , with an approximately 6 - fold increase in response to low N ( Fig . 6E ) . On the other hand , Ndc80 , an essential regulator of chromosome orientation and spindle attachment , had a 4 - fold lower expression level ( Fig .

A likely lower protein level of NDC80 may result in disrup - tion of the MIS12 – NDC80 bridge or shrinkage of the kineto - chore – microtubule binding interface , which caused chromosome misorientation ( Fig . 3D – F ) . To better dissect the molecular mechanism of overgeneration of micronuclei under low N stress , we further quantitatively ana - lyzed expression levels of several other critical genes regulating cell cycle progression . We searched for and obtained maize Rcc1 - 1 ( GRMZM2G302245 ) , Cdc20 - 1 ( GRMZM2G063192 ) and Aurora B kinase ( GRMZM2G132 - 116 ) sequences from the updated maize database ( maizesequence . org ) , cloned them and conﬁrmed that they were most probably the orthologs in the maize genome using reciprocal blast against the Arabidopsis genome . These key meiosis regulators are well conserved between plant and animal genomes and can be easily identiﬁed because maize RCC1 - 1 , CDC20 - 1 and Aurora B are 58 , 67 and 64 % similar , respectively , to their Arabidopsis homologs at the protein level . As shown in Fig . 6 , we detected a 27 - fold decrease in Rcc1 - 1 expression under the low N condition ( Fig . 6G ) . Such dramatic down - regulation of Rcc1 expression may lead to abnormal spindle attachment . Aurora B is thought to correct erroneous spindle – chromosome interactions in normal meiotic cells ( Lampson et al . 2004 , Monje - Casas et al . 2007 , Meyer et al . 2013 ) . With low N supply , the expression of putative maize Aurora B remained at a similar level to that of control plants ( Fig . 6H ) . Under this circumstance , Aurora B prob - ably failed to correct frequently occurring improper spindle – chromosome attachments . If ‘illegal’ chromosome orientation and spindle attachment is not properly corrected , CDC20 function is inhibited and the cell cycle is arrested to prevent premature chromosome segregation ( Petronczki et al . 2003 ) . Unfortunately , the low N treatment caused an approximately 200 - fold up - regu - lation of Cdc20 - 1 expression ( Fig . 6I ) . Such Cdc20 - 1 overexpression may promote securin destruction and cohesion cleavage , which accelerates anaphase onset and chromosome mis - segregation , leading to numerous haploid cells with micronuclei . We also ana - lyzed expression patterns of another putative Cdc20 gene ( Cdc20 - 2 ; GRMZM2G130425 ) and two other putative Rcc1 genes ( Rcc1 - 2 , GRMZM2G003565 ; and Rcc1 - 3 , GRMZM2G135770 ) , and found no signiﬁcant difference between the low N and control samples ( Supplementary Fig . S3 ) . Discussion Lower germination rates of pollen grains with low N supply were partially attributed to frequently occurring micronuclei during pollen genesis Low N may cause a range of physiological , developmental and cytogenetic effects on pollen genesis and maturation , which collectively led to lower germination rates of maize pollen . Cytogenetic defects are among the most fundamental factors affecting pollen germination and are therefore our primary re - search focus ( Sa ´ nchez - Mora ´ n et al . 2004 ) .

We detected a micro - nucleus in 2 . 75 % of the tetrads in low N plants ( 7 - fold of that of control ) ( Fig . 2A – C ) , indicating dramatic disruption of meiosis in pollen mother cells by the low N stress and subsequent chromosome loss . Notably , our ﬁnding was similar to an earlier observation ( 2 . 17 ± 1 . 35 % of cells with micronuclei ; Li and Dawe 2009 ) in maize mis12 RNAi mutant lines , although we had a lower fold change than the previous study . Our micronucleus frequency was comparable with the previous result in the study on mango where cold stress caused a 5 - fold increase in a similar assay ( Huang et al . 2008 ) , suggesting that N insufﬁciency imposed damage on maize pollen formation similar to that exerted on mango ﬂowering by cold stress . Some cells with micronuclei may die out before developing into mature pollen grains , and some may fail to germinate as pollen grains or eventually abort at later developmental stages . Collectively , the lower germination rate of pollen grains was , at least , par - tially attributed to numerous tetrad cells with micronuclei under the low N condition . Micronucleus formation may trace back to chromosome mis - segregation in anaphase I partially due to aberrant modulation of expression of key meiotic regulators Micronuclei may be derived from cytological errors in a range of key meiotic events such as chromosome cohesion , kinetochore orientation and spindle attachment ( Hassold and Hunt 2001 , Petronczki et al . 2003 , Handel and Schimenti , 2010 , Santaguida and Amon 2015 ) . In our study , the expression level of Rec8 and Sgo1 was not signiﬁcantly affected under the low N condition ( Fig . 6A , B ) , suggesting normally functioning cohesion .

Proper kinetochore orientation during metaphase I is dependent on a fully functional MIS12 – NDC80 bridge in maize ( Li and Dawe 2009 ) , especially NDC80 as a contact point for chromosome – spindle interaction ( Joglekar et al . 2006 , Wei et al . 2007 , Powers et al . 2009 , Alushin et al . 2010 ) . Four - fold down - regulation of Ndc80 expression ( Fig . 6F ) possibly may have caused ( i ) loose and unstable kinetochore – microtubule associations and more stochastic kinetochore capture ( DeLuca et al . 2006 , Joglekar et al . 2006 , Wei et al . 2007 , Powers et al . 2009 , Alushin et al . 2010 ) , which increased the probability of bi - orientation of sister kinetochores during meiosis I ; ( ii ) reduced recruitment of Aurora B kinase and components of the spindle assembly checkpoint ( Martin - Lluesma et al . 2002 , DeLuca et al . 2003 , Kemmler et al . 2009 , Alushin et al . 2012 , Umbreit et al . 2012 ) ; or ( iii ) compromised kinetochore structure and a weak MIS12 – NDC80 bridge between sister kinetochores ( Cheeseman and Desai 2008 , Li and Dawe 2009 ) . Taken together , Ndc80 down - regulation may allow ‘illegal’ bi - orientation of sister kin - etochores at metaphase I ( Fig . 3D – F ) . Further , Rcc1 - 1 was down - regulated approximately 27 - fold ( Fig . 6G ) . Given that RCC1 is required for proper chromosome – spindle attachment ( Carazo - Salas et al . 1999 , Moore et al . 2002 , Li and Zheng , 2004 , Chen et al . 2007 , Makde et al . 2010 ) , dramatic down - regulation of Rcc1 expression possibly disrupted proper spindle attach - ment . Down - regulation of Ndc80 and Rcc1 - 1 expression syner - gistically interfered with kinetochore orientation and interrupted cell cycle progression that led to metaphase arrest or was delayed by the APC / C CDC20 - mediated spindle checkpoint ( Visintin et al . 1997 , Lim et al . 1998 , Carazo - Salas et al . 1999 , Moore et al . 2002 , Peters , 2006 , Powers et al . 2009 , Alushin et al . 2010 ) . Aurora B functions to ensure that all kin - etochores are properly oriented and connected to microtu - bules before the cell cycle proceeds ( Lampson et al . 2004 , Kelly and Funabiki 2009 , Meyer et al . 2013 ) . However , the ex - pression of putative Aurora B remained at a similar level to that of the control ( Fig . 6H ) .

There was signiﬁcant down - regulation of Ndc80 ( 4 - fold ) and Rcc1 ( 27 - fold ) , and signiﬁcant up - regulation of Mis12 ( (cid:3) 6 - fold ) and Cdc20 ( (cid:3) 200 - fold ) under the LN treatment compared with that under CK conditions , with similar expression levels of Rec8 , Sgo1 , Cenh3 , Cenpc and Aurora B under different treatments . The bars represented the SD of three biological replicates . * * indicates highly signiﬁcant differences between CK and LN ( P < 0 . 01 , t - test ) . 349 Plant Cell Physiol . 58 ( 2 ) : 342 – 353 ( 2017 ) doi : 10 . 1093 / pcp / pcw195 sufﬁcient to correct improper attachments in this context beyond spontaneously occurring attachment errors . To a worse extent , a 200 - fold up - regulation of Cdc20 - 1 expression may have accelerated anaphase onset prematurely rather than suspended it for error correction ( Fig . 6I ; Visintin et al . 1997 ) . Like the previous observation in mis12 RNAi mutant meiocytes ( Li and Dawe 2009 ) and other mutant lines with mutations in crucial meiotic regulators ( Klein et al . 1999 , Shonn et al . 2000 , Camahort et al . 2007 ) , dramatic cytogenetic errors , including sister kinetochore misorientation and chromosome lagging in meiosis I and chromosome mis - segregation in meiosis II , became pronounced ( Figs . 3 , 4 ) and gave rise to micronuclei in haploid cells at the end of meiosis ( Fig . 5 ) . This is also similar to cytological phenotypes identiﬁed in Ndc80 or Rcc1 disrupted lines ( Carazo - Salas et al . 1999 , McCleland et al . 2003 ) . Haploid cells containing micronuclei at the tetrad stage very probably developed into poor pollen grains that eventually aborted and resulted in a lower germination rate under mid - term low N treatment ( Fig . 1A ) . Notably , meiosis is an extremely compli - cated cytogenetic process ( Petronczki et al . 2003 , Cheeseman and Desai 2008 ) ; therefore , other meiotic regulators ( Lermontova et al . 2015 ) or unrevealed defects caused by low N may contribute to micronucleus formation ( Fig 2A – C ) . Furthermore , it is likely that other post - meiotic defects also contribute to the substantial decrease of germination rates of pollen grains under low N ( Fig . 1 ) . In contrast to our previous mis12 mutant plants ( Li and Dawe 2009 ) , Mis12 expression was up - regulated in this context ( Fig . 6E ) ; however , this up - regulation is insufﬁcient to rescue cytological errors caused by aberrant Ndc80 , Cdc20 - 1 and Rcc1 - 1 expression . On the other hand , normal functioning of Cdc20 - 2 , Rcc1 - 2 and Rcc1 - 3 probably prevented more severe chromo - some misbehavior caused by misregulation of Cdc20 - 1 and Rcc1 - 1 ( Fig . 6G , I ; Supplementary Fig . S3 ) . Lastly , reasoning based on gene expression calls for future investigation at the protein level in terms of protein abundance and localization with well performing antibodies . To characterize further mis - orientation of sister kinetochores at metaphase I as we did previously ( Li and Dawe 2009 ) , antibodies of at least two pro - teins located in different kinetochore domains ( inner , central and outer domains ; Yu et al . 2000 ) are required to be generated in two different animal systems for double labeling . Lastly , tubu - lin antibodies have to be generated to visualize spindle defects after failure with two commercial antibodies . The low N - speciﬁc lower germination rate of pollen grains was loosely associated with low grain yield in maize production The ear size and grain number are key factors in determining grain yield in maize production ( Below et al . 1981 ) . Grain for - mation depends on timely pollination , nutrient allocation and carbohydrate accumulation ( Below et al . 2000 ) . Pollen germin - ation is the ﬁrst step towards successful fertilization . Water insufﬁciency reduces grain set in wheat mainly due to male sterility , whereas female fertility remains unaffected ( Bingham 1966 , Saini and Aspinall 1981 ) . Low temperature also induces pollen sterility in rice , resulting in yield losses ( Oliver et al . 2005 ) . Our studies showed that 4 weeks of low N led to a 20 % decrease in the germination rate of maize pollen grains , whereas low P or K had no signiﬁcant effect ( Fig . 1A ) . Therefore , low N not only reduces the photosynthetic rate and carbohydrate partition into kernels , but also decreases the ear size and pollen germin - ation rates ( Fig . 1A ; Supplementary Fig . S1 ; Below et al . 1981 , Below et al . 2000 , Liao et al . 2012 ) . The lower germination rate of pollen grains under the low N condition may be directly derived from reduced N allocation towards the tassel ( or pollen ) , com - positional change of N compounds or a systemic effect of low N supply . Under extreme circumstances with a limited amount of pollen grains , germination failure directly reduces pollination efﬁciency and tends to decrease the grain number . However , there are generally a vast excess of pollen grains in the maize ﬁeld during the pollination period ; poor ear development and growth are the major cause of yield reduction rather than low germination rates of pollen grains . Materials and Methods Plant culture and growth conditions Maize ( Zea mays L . ) seeds ( inbred line 478 , an N - efﬁcient line from Dr . Fanjun Chen at China Agricultural University ) ( Wang et al . 2005 , Han et al . 2016 ) were surface - sterilized , soaked and germinated at 30 (cid:4) C for 2 d in a plant growth chamber . Germinated seeds were transferred to pots ( 23cm diameter (cid:5) 38cm depth , three plants per pot ) containing acid - washed quartz sand ( 0 . 25 – 0 . 5mm in diameter ) . All pots had small drainage holes in the bottom . After 1 week , one vigorous three - leaf seedling per pot was selected for continuous culture and the other two seedlings were removed . The full nutrient solution was made as described previously ( Niu et al . 2010 ) , and plants were watered with excess nutrient solution every other day before the jointing stage and every day after - wards . To avoid potential salt stress , the sand was washed with distilled water every 15 d . Plants were grown in a standard glass greenhouse under controlled conditions with a light / dark regime of 14 / 10h , air temperature of 28 (cid:4) C / 18 (cid:4) C and relative humidity of 45 – 55 % ( Niu et al . 2007 ) . Each pot was covered by a layer of black plastic ﬁlm to prevent green algae growth and a second layer of white ﬁlter paper to reduce heat absorption and overaccumulation . Treatments and sampling Four weeks after being transferred to pots , plants were treated as follows : control ( 6mM N , 375 m M phosphorus , 1 . 875mM potassium ) , low N ( 2mM ; Niu et al . 2010 ) , low phosphorus ( 37 . 5 m M ) or low potassium ( 375 m M ) , six pots per treatment as technical replicates . Each set of experiments was repeated six times as biological replicates ( three times for pollen analysis and three times for meiotic analysis ) . Seven - week - old tassels from individual plants were harvested , wrapped up with paper towels and immediately saturated with buffer A ( 80mM KCl , 20mM NaCl , 0 . 5mM EGTA , 2mM EDTA and 15mM PIPES buffer , pH 7 . 0 ) for cytological analysis . The same young tassels were frozen in liquid N 2 and stored at – 80 (cid:4) C for total RNA extraction . After old pollen grains were removed from 9 - week - old plants by vigorously shaking tassels on the preceding evening , fresh pollen samples were obtained from all plants by gently shaking at around 09 : 00 – 09 : 30h and immediately used for in vitro ger - mination analysis . Pollen germination analysis A 10mg aliquot of homogenous pollen grains from each plant was added to a microcentrifuge tube with 500 m l of pollen germination solution ( 0 . 35mol l – 1 sucrose , 0 . 03 % CaCl 2 , 0 . 01 % H 3 BO 3 ) . After mixing well by gentle pipetting , the mixture was evenly coated onto Petri dishes containing pollen growth medium ( 0 . 35mol l – 1 sucrose , 0 . 03 % CaCl 2 , 0 . 01 % H 3 BO 3 , 0 . 7 % agarose ; modiﬁed after 350 H . Zheng et al . | Aberrant meiotic modulation affects pollen germination Aylor 2004 ) using a spreader . Petri dishes were sealed with paraﬁlm , incubated at 25 (cid:4) C for 3h , and then immediately observed under a microscope ( Olympus , BX51 ) to count germinated pollen grains in 10 ﬁelds per Petri dish . Approximately 200 pollen grains from each sample were examined , with three different plants as technical replicates , and another two sets of plants were sampled as biological replicates . For a given treatment , the germination rate = the total number of germinated pollen grains / the total number of germinated and ungeminated pollen grains . Cytological analysis Cytological analysis was carried out as described previously ( Yu et al . 1997 , Li and Dawe 2009 ) . Brieﬂy , ﬂorets were screened for anthers with tetrads and meiotic cells in 1 (cid:5) PHEMS buffer plus 0 . 32 M sorbitol . Selected anthers were ﬁxed in a cell culture dish containing the ﬁxative [ 1 (cid:5) PHEMS buffer , 4 % par - aformaldehyde , 1 % ( v / v ) Triton X - 100 ] with vigorous shaking at room tem - perature for 2h . Fixed anthers were rinsed in 1 (cid:5) phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ; 137mMNaCl , 2 . 7mMKCl , 10mMNa 2 HPO 4 , 2mMKH 2 PO 4 , pH7 . 4 ) three times . The meiocytes were extruded from the ﬁxed anthers in PBS under a dissecting microscope , transferred onto poly - L - lysine - ( P0425 - 72EA , Sigma ) coated glass slides , brieﬂy spun in a tabletop centrifuge , incubated with primary antibodies ( anti - rabbit MIS12 , 1 : 100 in 1 (cid:5) PBS ) overnight and secondary anti - bodies [ anti - rabbit IgG ( H + L ) , 1 : 100 in 1 (cid:5) PBS ] for 4h . The cells were washed with 1 (cid:5) PBS buffer three times after incubation . Chromosomes were then stained with VECTASHIELD with DAPI ( H - 1200 , Vector Laboratories Inc . ) , cov - ered with coverslips and sealed . Images were captured using a Sensys CCD camera ( QIMAGING , RETIGA - SRV , FAST 1394 ) attached to an Olympus BX61 epiﬂuorescence microscope . The slides were stored in a slide box at 4 (cid:4) C . Three plants were harvested for each treatment , with three sets of plants as biological replicates . Total RNA extraction , reverse transcription and quantitative real - time PCR analysis Frozen maize anthers ( 100mg ) were ground in liquid N 2 , and total RNA was extracted using the TRIzol method ( Invitrogen ) . Reverse transcription was per - formed according to the manufacturer’s instructions ( M - MLV , Invitrogen ) .
