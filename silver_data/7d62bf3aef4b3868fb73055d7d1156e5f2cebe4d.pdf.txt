The Dynamic Re - evaluation of Alterqatives and the Emulation of Human Decision Making Joe K . Clema and Mark Fynewever Colorado State University C ~ NSIM ( Conflict Simulator ) , a computer program designed to heuristically simulate decision making ( 3 ) , has incorporated Bayes ' Theorem in its structure to re - evaluate alternatives as new information becomes available to the decision maker . With this ability to re - evaluate alternatives utilizing both present and past information , even complex areas such as interna - tional affairs may be heuristically studied and analyzed . By employing elements of game theory , computer modeling and simulation , Bayes ' Theorem , and probabilistic utility theory , the authors have developed a program that simulates decision making for n - person , zero - sum games with an arbitrary number of alternatives for each participant . The capabil $ ty of human misunder - standing and misinterpretation of opponent ' s decisions has been included in the model . The methodology of C @ NSIM is general and may be applied in virtually any area of decision making where the alternatives are mutually exclusive , exhaustive , and the decision maker is willing to use a Bayesian approach in the assignment of probabilities , or has statistical records available .

Yet the methodology of sophisticated decision making in complex situations seems still to be little understood . The common denominators of " good " decision making do not seem to be well - defined ; nor have mathematical models sufficiently evolved to the point that we are able to emulate the decision making process of human beings operating in a complex environment . Yet the authors feel that the mathematical methods presently available coupled with today ' s computer technology provide the capability to devise systems which permit the simulation ( and probably the emulation ) of man ' s decision making processes . Though general problem solving programs of some sophistication ( i ) have been written , the develop - ment of a truly general problem solving program capable of choosing " good " alternatives in complex situations is probably twenty years off . ( 2 ) STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM The authors have developed and are continu - ally expanding a program , C ~ NSIM ( 3 ) , which attempts to provide insights into the processes of human judgement . The question to be answered is , " Can the human decision making process be emulated by the technique of computer modeling and simulation ? " C ~ NSIM , a F ~ RTRAN program , is a computer program which chooses from a table of alternatives and re - evaluates the utility of alternatives based on new information . This program provides a system to test theories and hypotheses about the choosing of alternatives in complex situations where the information available to the decision maker is not necessarily sufficient to enable him to make the " best " decision . C ~ NSIM has been designed for n - person , non - zero sum games , with utiles determined by a Bayesian Approach based on a risk , cost , and benefit analysis from available information and past experience . The heuristic approach employed by the authors involves a great deal of generalization ; even so this approach may be quite similar to human decision making in the face of uncertainty . METHODOLOGY OF SOLUTION The Monte Carlo simulation coupled with Bayesian analysis , Bayes ' Theorem , and utilities provide a model permitting a researcher to ask questions and test hypotheses about decision making . In the C ~ NSIM model one might ask and test such questions as the following : What would happen if we employ a ' hard line ' ? What would happen if we do not consider any possibility of employing nuclear weapons ? How sensitive are the estimates in the initialization of the program ? Are other methods of evaluation and re - evalu - tion plausible ? What happens when particular alternatives , and combinations of alternatives are employed in various situations ? What chain of events might lead to a nuclear war ? 852 C ~ NSIM , in its present form , might prove to be a valuable aid in political science courses and business courses . A slight modification in C ~ NSIM would permit a student ( or students ) to play one of the opponent ( s ) on an interactive terminal to experiment with the above questions . The computer emulation of human decision - making implies selecting " good " alternatives by a program that rivals its human counterparts based on the same goals , information , situation , and present environment . It has been demonstrated ( 4 ) that humans generally perform suboptimally when operating in areas of uncertainty and manipulating probabil - istic information . Thus , when employing probabil - istic utiles ( 5 ) in a Bayesian Approach ( 3 , 6 , 7 ) , Bayes ' Theorem may be used to provide a method for optimizing ( 8 ) the utiles and re - evaluating the alternatives . The basis for the program ' s model at present is a Monte Carlo simulation established initially upon user input . ( See Tables i and 2 ) . The authors assume that the better informed a decision - maker is , the better his decisions will be , whether that decision - maker is a man or a machine . In sophisticated areas of decision - making such as international politics , there will in general be no frequency distributions available from past records to judge such questions as , " What will China ' s reaction be if we mine the ports of North Viet Nam ? " , or " If we withdraw all ground forces , what will China do ? " Still , an informed and experienced person should be able to make more valid estimates about situations than an uninformed person unfamiliar with Viet Nam and the Viet Namese conflict . With the Bayesian Approach it is assumed that a person ' s past experiences and knowledge of a situation counts for something . As an example , it would be expected that a native Coloradoan would be able to make a more reliable estimate of the percentage of sunny days in Colorado without consulting any additional records , whereas a European unfamiliar with Colorado would not be expected to make that same " good " estimate . Similarly , from past experience , the Coloradoan should be able to predict with some reliability , weather in Colorado , but an uninformed outsider should not be able to do as well . Certainly these initial estimates of what will happen in a given situation are not infallible predictions . But with the implementation of Bayes ' Theorem ( 3 , 9 ) alterna - tives can be re - evaluated and updated as more information about the present situation becomes available . The authors believe that they might be able to employ certain search methods in their model to provide the computer program with the capability of formulating new alternatives to be considered . It is rather interesting that experiments have demonstrated that humans re - evalu - ate alternatives and change opinions in proportion with Bayes ' Theorem as they accumulate new information ( 8 ) and when the human is willing to change his opinions .

( 8 ) In a nutshell then , the human decision maker employing C ~ NSIM is asked to make initial evalua - tions and rank the alternatives that are mutually exclusive , exhaustive , and are considered to be valid policies that might actually be employed . This Bayesian statistical approach says that the decision maker ' s prior experience provides him with the capability of making good estimates about the probability of events occurring . Bayes ' Theorem is then used to update the probabilities as new information becomes available . Thus , the prior probabilities presumably assigned objectively ( but , of course , subject to present knowledge , prejudice , emotion , and personal experience ) , are modified to presumably more reliable measures of the current situation as more information is accumulated arbitrarily chosen . See TABLES one and two for examples of initial a priori probabilities . After each move is made , the other partici - pant ( s ) view the move , interpret the move , and then use Bayes ' Theorem to update the probabil - ity tables for their side , as well as adjust the frequency tables for that category . A simple example of what is done follows : Initial Table Alternatives Categ0ri ~ s 1 Z Status Peaceful quo Move . 5 . 5 . 6 i . Peace proposal . 4 . 3 . 3 2 . Status Quo . 2 . 2 . i 3 . Renew Build - up . i . 05 The above is a simplified portion of a part of the TABLE and is not very realistic . However , it will permit the demonstration of the use of Bayes ' Theorem . ( 6 ) THE COMPUTER SIMULATION MODEL The Viet Namese conflict has been chosen as an example of the use of CONSIM . Only two opponents will be used in the example for simplic - ity . Though a multitude of alternatives are avail - able for consideration , only some of the more interesting options available to each side are presented . The options available to each side may be grouped into four , more general , categories . These are l ) Status Quo , 2 ) peaceful move , 3 ) threatening move , and 4 ) imminent nuclear war . ( 3 ) These categories , as well as the alternatives are P ( Ai ) P ( B / A i ) P ( Ai / B ) k E P ( B / Aj ) P ( Aj ) j = i The updating is performed as follows : P ( CAT . I ) P ( ALT . I / CAT . I ) P ( CAT . I / ALT . I ) = 2 Z P ( CAE . J ) P ( ALT . I / CAT . j ) j = i 854 Substituting into this equation yields ( . 5 ) ( . 4 ) P ~ AilB ~ , , = = ( . 5 ) ( . 4 ) + ( . 5 ) ( . 3 ) . 75 Following the same procedure for each element in the table , a new table is produced . This is the probability of each category , given that a particular alternative has occurred . New Bayesian Table Alternatives Cate $ ories + + + + + i 2 Status Peaceful quo Move i . Peace Proposal . 57 . 43 2 . Status Quo . 50 . 50 3 . Renew Build - up . 67 . 33 Now the original table may be updated by again applying Bayes ' Theorem . The procedure is very similar to the previous example ; however , this time the formula is : P ( ALT . IICAT . I ) = P ( ALT . I ) P ( CAT . I / ALT . I ) 3 E P ( ALT . j ) P ( CAT . I / ALT . j ) j = i = ! : 6 ) ( . 57 ) ( . 6 ) ( . 57 ) + ( . 3 ) ( . 50 ) + ( . i ) ( . 67 ) . 342 = . 559 = . 61 Similarly , all probabilities are updated to produce the following new table : Updated Table Alternatives Categories + + + + + i 2 Status Peaceful quo Move . 5 . 5 . 6 . 612 . 585 . 3 . 268 . 340 . i . 120 . 075 PROGRAM OPERATION C @ NSIM is a dynamic simulation of a political situation . With further developments such as strategies to seek and attain goals , and heuristic search methods , the authors believe that C @ NSIM can become much more than an interesting simulation . At the present time the dynamic alteration of probabilities coupled with the initial input determines the final output at the end of a run . A run consists of randomly determining the order in which the participants move by utilizing a random number generator . This order is then followed throughout the remainder of the game . Each participant can only react to the move of the participant which immediately precedes him , though work is under way to review all moves in the current cycle and react to them . At each turn , a participant is able to choose any one of the finite number of alternatives he possesses . The probabilistic utiles determine the actual alternative chosen as the computer program generates a random number ; then , from the cumula - tive distribution of the particular category the player is in , the alternative is chosen . ( 3 ) As the moves continue to be made , a frequency count is maintained corresponding to each probability position . The updating after each move consists of incrementing by one the count for a particular alternative chosen under a particular category heading . The number of times a category and an alternative are chosen are each counted also . When C @ NSIM begins executing , the updating begins - the frequency counts , the choosing of alternatives , the evaluations , and re - evaluations as described . The frequencies of events begin to change as they are updated with the latest information . When Bayes ' Theorem is applied , the probability tables are re - evaluated and a revised table is the result . This table ( The New Bayesian Table ) describes the probability ( utility ) of being in a particular category , given the fact that a specific alternative has been chosen . Bayes ' Theorem is then applied again . This time it is used on the New Bayesian probabil - ity table to produce a new , updated probability table . The table now contains the probability of choosing an alternative given that a specific category has been determined from an opponent ' s past move . The capability of misinterpretations ( 3 ) which has been incorporated into C @ NSIM provides the ability to determine the percent of " mistakes " a participant is to make . ( 3 ) If one chooses ten percent , then again utilizing random numbers , a participant will randomly choose the category to pick his alternative from ten percent of the time , rather than choosing the category based on what his opponent did . With this capability it is possible to experiment on the importance of misinterpretations and see what effect they will have on the outcome of a run . RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS It is very interesting to examine output from a C ~ NSIM run and interpret what meaning to give the results . After several thousand rounds ( generally far less than i0 thousand rounds ) the program has reached steady state . Some probabil - ities have changed significantly , some very little . ( See TABLES i , 2 , 3 , and 4 ) . The number of occurrences of nuclear war are , of course , interesting to examine , and since the probabilities for nuclear war usually drop rapidly ( See GRAPHS i and 2 ) it is interesting to speculate on the significance of this result . In the TABLES are shown an example where the output actually resulted in an increase in the probability for nuclear war . This is , of course , partially dependent upon the initialization where nuclear war is given low probability of occurring . Still , it is not completely clear why the probability for this category should usually rapidly drop , as our model in no way precludes the occurrence of nuclear war . It should be pointed out that C ~ NSIM has been validated ( 3 ) on three different random number generators and sensitivity analysis tests have been performed . 855 ALTERNATIVE PROBAB IL ITY + + + + + I . 14900 2 . 15382 3 . 28182 4 . 08982 5 . 10600 6 . 00973 7 . 00091 8 . 20891 CURRENT STATUS OF USA CURRENT MOVE IS PEACE PROPOSAL FROM CATEGORY 3 THIS MOVE WAS MADE IN ROUND NUMBER i0000 PROBABILITY TABLE CATEGORY i 2 3 4 PROBABILITY - > รท - > . 29638 . 26229 . 42860 . 01273 WITHDRAW TROOPS INCREASE BOMBING STATUS QUO RENEW VIETNAM BUILDUP COMPLETE WITHDRAWAL THREATEN NUCLEAR WAR EMPLOY NUCLEAR WEAPONS PEACE PROPOSAL โข 13489 . 15110 . 15971 . 07356 โข 15624 . 15611 . 15482 . 01644 โข 29784 . 30667 . 25614 . 26133 โข 08497 . 07845 . 09893 . 13001 โข 09351 . 12782 . 09124 . 44420 โข 00462 . 00770 . 01478 . 00014 โข 00255 . 00042 . 00010 . 00001 โข 22537 . 17173 . 22428 . 07430 + CATEGORIES + ALTERNATIVE PROBABILITY + + + + + 1 . 16636 2 . 11791 3 . 29500 4 . 14227 5 . 10791 6 . 01345 7 . 00009 8 . 15700 CURRENT STATUS OF CHINA CURRENT MOVE IS INCREASE AID THIS MOVE WAS MADE IN ROUND NUMBER I0000 INCREASE AID SEND MORE ADVISORS STATUS QUO SEND ARMIES COMPLETE WITHDRAWAL THREATEN NUCLEAR WAR EMPLOY NUCLEAR WEAPONS PEACE PROPOSAL PROBABILITY TABLE CATEGORY i 2 PROBABILITY - > รท - > . 28207 . 45720 . 15869 . 14850 . 11304 . 14088 . 29414 . 29895 . 15270 . 12006 . 09181 . 12057 . 01191 . 00929 . 00010 . 00007 . 17761 . 16169 FROM CATEGORY 2 3 4 . 25100 . 00982 . 18674 . 69789 . 08606 . 00243 . 29792 . 06100 โข 16780 . 22459 . 10671 . 01113 . 02330 . 00019 . 00012 . 00002 โข 13134 . 00276 TABLE 3 + CATEGORIES + 3 3 1 3 2 4 4 2 ALTERNATIVE PROBABILITY + + + + + 1 . 12055 2 . 15464 3 . 27591 4 . 13109 5 . 09127 6 . 00873 7 . 00009 8 . 21773 CURRENT STATUS OF USA CURRENT MOVE IS INCREASE BOMBING FROM CATEGORY 2 THIS MOVE WAS MADE IN ROUND NUMBER i0000 100 % MISINTERPRETATION PROBABILITY TABLE CATEGORY PROBABILITY - 9 - - > - - ) - 1 2 3 4 . 29984 . 29293 . 31424 . 09300 WITHDRAW TROOPS INCREASE BOMBING STATUS QUO RENEW VIETNAM BUILDUP COMPLETE WITHDRAWAL THREATEN NUCLEAR WAR EMPLOY NUCLEAR WEAPONS PEACE PROPOSAL โข 10817 . 14306 . 14146 . 01886 โข 14808 . 14350 . 14752 . 23490 โข 30017 . 27336 . 28542 . 17359 โข 11371 . 08483 . 10283 . 42835 โข 08910 . 09894 . 10188 . 03831 โข 00881 . 00907 . 01062 . 00100 โข 00009 . 00007 . 00014 . 00000 โข 23187 . 24718 . 21015 . 10499 TABLE 4 + CATEGORIES + 856 ALTERNATIVE PROBABILITY + + + + + i . 17982 2 . 13136 3 . 27100 4 . 11318 5 . 12136 6 . 01245 7 . 00018 8 . 17064 CURRENT STATUS OF CHINA CURRENT MOVE IS PEACE PROPOSAL FROM CATEGORY 4 THIS MOVE WAS MADE IN ROUND NUMBER i0000 100 % MISINTERPRETATION PROBABILITY TABLE CATEGORY PROBABILITY - ~ - + - > 1 2 3 4 . 29907 . 30575 . 30673 . 08855 INCREASE AID SEND MORE ADVISORS STATUS QUO SEND ARMIES COMPLETE WITHDRAWAL THREATEN NUCLEAR WAR EMPLOY NUCLEAR WEAPONS PEACE PROPOSAL . 18341 . 18608 . 22187 . 00040 . 14613 . 11165 . 14037 . 11834 . 25918 . 28707 . 24883 . 33222 . 13459 . 12541 . 10382 . 03105 . 12520 . 12440 . 10778 . 14497 . 01275 . 00972 . 01847 . 00002 . 00039 . 00011 . 00010 . 00000 . 13833 . 15556 . 15875 . 37300 + CATEGORIES + TABLE 4 o ~ i - q O t ~ O C ~ t ~ O C ~ o .

This game is a military game where there must be a winner - no chance of a stalemate . In this game the decision maker ( the computer program ) will manage goals , alternatives ( their consequences and implications ) , and constantly keep track of the present environment ( current situation ) . The program will utilize an evaluation routine and search routine to establish utiles and formulate strategies . The utiles ( again probabilistic ) will be maintained in a matrix and game theory methods , ( probably the minimax method ) , will be employed to determine moves . The program is therefore capable of ranking alternatives and forming a preference . If the search methods and evaluation routine prove to be sophisticated enough , then the program will be able to choose the alternatives which will bring it ( the decision maker ) closer to the desired goal of winning . By using a random access storage to manage the data base , the program will have access to all past lines of play . By using Bayes ' Theorem , the program will re - evaluate each game ( and hence the line of play ) based on whether the program won or lost . The matrix of all possible moves at each step will be in the data base and will be rated with probabilistic utiles making the re - evaluation possible . Thus , the fundamental concepts ( rules of the game ) , goals ( winning - capturing the opponent ' s general ) , and present environment ( initial location of the pieces ) will be given to the program . This initial data base will be processed , analyzed , evaluated , updated , and re - evaluated in an attempt to predict optimally what the future move should be in order to bring the program closer to its goal . The feed - back which the program receives should permit for a " learning " process in which the decision 858 maker improves over the course of many games . If this feedback can be correctly implemented by the use of Bayes ' Theorem , and if the evaluation and search techniques are sufficiently sophisti - cated the authors will soon be able to present a new version of C ~ NSIM which " learns " from its own mistakes and should never make the identical mistake twice .
