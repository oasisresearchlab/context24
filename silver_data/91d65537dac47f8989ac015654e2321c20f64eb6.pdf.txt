Why was the study conducted ? 7 • There are limited data on coronavirus disease 2019 outcomes when contracted during 8 pregnancy . 9 • In this study we describe 141 cases of SARS - CoV - 2 infection in pregnancy and 10 postpartum period in a racially and ethnically diverse population . 11 • We sought to describe demographics of COVID - 19 pregnant population , identify risk 12 factors for worse clinical course , review laboratory trends and provide perinatal 13 outcomes . 14 B . What are the key findings ? 15 • The overall rate of moderate and severe disease was low in pregnant women in our 16 series ( 4 . 3 % ) ; however , there was one maternal death . 17 • Hispanic women were disproportionately affected by SARS - CoV - 2 compared to 18 other racial / ethnic groups . 19 • Hispanic ethnicity and obesity were risk factors for worse clinical course . 20 C . What does the study add to what is already known ? 21 • Our study identifies Hispanic ethnicity and obesity as risk factors for worse clinical 22 course of COVID - 19 in pregnancy . 23 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 2 ABSTRACT 24 Background : Older age and medical comorbidities are identified risk factors for developing 25 severe COVID - 19 . However , there are limited data on risk stratification , clinical and laboratory 26 course , and optimal management of COVID - 19 in pregnancy . 27 Objective : Our study aims to describe the clinical course of COVID - 19 , effect of comorbidities 28 on disease severity , laboratory trends , and pregnancy outcomes of symptomatic and 29 asymptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 positive pregnant women . 30 Study Design : This is a case series of pregnant and postpartum women who tested positive for 31 SARS - CoV - 2 between 3 / 1 / 2020 and 5 / 11 / 2020 within 3 hospitals of the Yale - New Haven Health 32 delivery network . Charts were reviewed for basic sociodemographic and pre - pregnancy 33 characteristics , COVID - 19 course , laboratory values , and pregnancy outcomes . 34 Results : Out of 1 , 567 tested pregnant and postpartum women between 3 / 1 / 2020 and 5 / 11 / 2020 , 35 9 % ( n = 141 ) had a positive SARS - CoV - 2 result . Hispanic women were overrepresented in the 36 SARS - CoV - 2 positive group ( n = 61 ; 43 . 8 % ) . Additionally , Hispanic ethnicity was associated 37 with higher rate of moderate and severe disease compared to non - Hispanic ( 18 % ( 11 / 61 ) vs 3 . 8 % 38 ( 3 / 78 ) , respectively , OR 5 . 5 95 % CI 1 . 46 - 20 . 7 , p = 0 . 01 ) . Forty - four women ( 31 . 2 % ) were 39 asymptomatic , 37 ( 26 . 2 % ) of whom were diagnosed on universal screening upon admission for 40 delivery . Fifty - nine percent ( n = 83 ) were diagnosed antepartum , 36 % ( n = 51 ) upon presentation 41 for childbirth and 5 % ( n = 7 ) postpartum . Severe disease was diagnosed in 6 cases ( 4 . 3 % ) and 42 there was one maternal death . Obese women were more likely to develop moderate and severe 43 disease than non - obese women ( 16 . 4 % ( 9 / 55 ) vs 3 . 8 % ( 3 / 79 ) , OR 4 . 96 , 95 % CI 1 . 28 - 19 . 25 , 44 p = 0 . 02 ) . Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy were diagnosed in 22 . 3 % ( 17 / 77 ) of women who 45 delivered after 20 weeks . Higher levels of C - reactive protein during antepartum COVID - 19 - 46 related admission were more common in women with worse clinical course ; this association , 47 however , did not reach statistical significance . 48 Conclusion : COVID - 19 in pregnancy may result in severe disease and death . Hispanic women 49 were more likely to test positive for SARS - CoV - 2 than other ethnic groups . Obesity and 50 Hispanic ethnicity represent risk factors for moderate and severe disease . 51 52 Keywords : coronavirus , COVID - 19 , SARS - CoV - 2 , pregnancy , Hispanic ethnicity 53 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 3 INTRODUCTION 54 Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) , a single - stranded RNA 55 virus , causes coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) and is responsible for a global health 56 emergency . This pandemic has led to over 29 million people infected and over 925 , 000 deaths 57 worldwide ( as of September 14 , 2020 ) . 1 This health crisis has spared no demographic , causing 58 concern about its impact on vulnerable populations , such as pregnant women . 2 , 3 59 Since the start of the pandemic , clinicians and researchers have steadily expanded the 60 understanding of COVID - 19 in pregnancy . However , the total number of cases reported in the 61 literature remains limited . This study aims to describe the clinical course of pregnant women and 62 their neonates in a large , diverse hospital system in a significantly affected region adjacent to 63 New York City , one of the United States’ initial infectious epicenters . Medical comorbidities and 64 sociodemographic factors were examined for association with COVID - 19 severity and clinical 65 course . Lastly , we report laboratory trends for SARS - CoV - 2 positive pregnant women admitted 66 to the hospital . 67 MATERIALS AND METHODS 68 Study population 69 This is a case series of all pregnant and postpartum women with positive SARS - CoV - 2 70 RT - PCR tests between 3 / 1 / 2020 and 5 / 11 / 2020 from three Yale New Haven Health hospitals 71 ( Yale New Haven , Bridgeport , and Greenwich hospitals ) . Subjects were identified using an 72 electronic health record ( EHR ) search for an open pregnancy episode and a SARS - CoV - 2 RT - 73 PCR laboratory result within the timeframe . Ambulatory and inpatient testing was included . 74 Each chart was individually reviewed for current pregnant status ( positive pregnancy test with or 75 without ultrasound confirmation ) or pregnancy resolution within 6 weeks of SARS - CoV - 2 test 76 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 4 for inclusion into the study cohort . Subjects with a positive test were included for analysis . Each 77 case was individually reviewed to collect the following : baseline sociodemographic factors ; past 78 medical , surgical and obstetric history ; antenatal course ; and COVID - 19 course including 79 symptoms , laboratory and imaging studies , management , maternal , and neonatal outcomes . The 80 study was approved by Yale University institutional review board with waiver of consent 81 ( HIC2000027797 ) . 82 Testing and diagnosis of COVID - 19 83 SARS - CoV - 2 testing used RT - PCR analysis of nasopharyngeal swab specimens . Testing 84 criteria generally consisted of either 1 ) patients with symptoms of COVID - 19 as deemed by their 85 healthcare provider or the institutional COVID - 19 Call Center , or 2 ) universal testing of all 86 pregnant women who were admitted after April 1 , 2020 for delivery or antepartum management . 87 Testing criteria of symptomatic patients evolved during the study period and were set by 88 institutional committees guided by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) 89 recommendations . Neonatal testing was indicated for all newborns born to mothers who tested 90 positive for SARS - CoV - 2 within 2 weeks of the delivery and was performed by RT - PCR of 91 nasopharyngeal samples between 24 and 48 hours of birth . 4 92 Disease severity was classified per World Health Organization ( WHO ) into 93 asymptomatic ( no current or previous symptoms ) , mild ( symptomatic patients without evidence 94 of viral pneumonia or hypoxia ) , moderate ( clinical signs of pneumonia without signs of severe 95 pneumonia and no need for supplemental oxygen ) , severe ( signs of severe pneumonia i . e . 96 respiratory rate of 30 / min or more , blood oxygen saturation of less than 95 % [ the threshold for 97 oxygen supplementation in pregnancy ] , severe respiratory distress ) , and critical ( acute 98 respiratory distress syndrome , sepsis or septic shock ) . 5 Outpatient triage of the pregnant COVID - 99 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 5 19 population was performed per institutional guidelines ( Supplemental Figure 1 ) . For analysis , 100 severe and critical disease were combined , resulting in a total of 4 groups . Final disease severity 101 was assigned retrospectively according to the above definitions which were set up a priori by a 102 panel of Maternal - Fetal Medicine subspecialists based on the entire course of the disease . 103 Race and ethnicity information were self - reported at the time of hospital registration and 104 abstracted directly from the EHR . Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy ( HDP ) , including 105 gestational hypertension , preeclampsia without and with severe features , eclampsia and HELLP , 106 were identified during individual chart review . All diagnoses were confirmed to meet the 107 American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists ( ACOG ) criteria of HDP . 6 Laboratory 108 testing guidelines for admitted patients varied between the hospitals and evolved over time . D - 109 dimer and C - reactive protein ( CRP ) were chosen for analysis as the most consistently tested and 110 trended lab studies . Since the occurrence of birth affects the levels of these lab values , we 111 divided our cohort into two groups for the purpose of analysis : women admitted for delivery 112 ( symptomatic and asymptomatic ) and women admitted in the antepartum period and discharged 113 undelivered . 114 Statistical analysis 115 Patient characteristics including sociodemographics , pregnancy outcomes , comorbidities , and 116 disease severity are reported descriptively and presented as percentages of the total cohort . 117 Continuous variables were not normally distributed and thus reported as median and interquartile 118 range ( IQR ) . Bivariate analysis to evaluate the association between patient characteristics , 119 comorbidities , and disease severity was performed using Fisher exact test . Due to the low 120 number of subjects in the moderate and severe groups , to further examine the association 121 between ethnicity ( Hispanic and non - Hispanic ) and obesity ( pre - pregnancy BMI ≥ 30 and < 30 122 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 6 kg / m 2 ) with severity of the disease , the cohort was organized into two groups : 123 asymptomatic / mild disease and moderate / severe disease . Unadjusted odds ratios ( OR ) with 95 % 124 confidence intervals ( CI ) were calculated for these dichotomous measures . Adjusted OR were 125 unable to be calculated due to small sample size . Tests of association between specific symptoms 126 and disease severity were restricted to those with symptoms ( n = 97 ) . In this group we evaluated 127 the association between COVID - 19 severity as a 3 - level categorical measure ( mild , moderate , 128 severe ) and dichotomous measures of symptoms using the Fisher exact test . Non - parametric 129 Mann - Whitney U test was used to compare non - normally distributed continuous variables ( CRP 130 values ) . P value < 0 . 05 was considered significant . 131 132 RESULTS 133 During the study period , 1 , 567 pregnant and postpartum women were evaluated for 134 SARS - CoV - 2 based on symptoms or as part of the universal testing protocol upon presentation 135 for delivery or antepartum admission ; 8 . 9 % ( 141 / 1 , 567 ) tested positive . Fifty - nine percent 136 ( 84 / 141 ) of positive patients received their care at Yale New Haven Hospital , 24 . 1 % ( 34 / 141 ) at 137 Bridgeport Hospital and 16 . 3 % ( 23 / 141 ) at Greenwich Hospital . The median age of the cohort 138 was 30 years ( IQR 25 - 34 ) ( Table 1 ) . The median pre - pregnancy body mass index ( BMI ) was 139 28 . 4 kg / m 2 ( IQR 24 . 1 - 35 . 1 ) . Forty - four percent ( 61 / 141 ) of women were Hispanic , 27 . 3 % 140 ( 38 / 141 ) were non - Hispanic white , 21 . 6 % ( 30 / 141 ) were non - Hispanic black , and 7 . 2 % ( 10 / 141 ) 141 were of Asian or other race . Among all tested women the racial / ethnic breakdown was as 142 follows : Hispanic 23 . 5 % ( 356 / 1 , 567 ) ; non - Hispanic white 54 . 2 % ( 823 / 1 , 567 ) ; non - Hispanic 143 black 13 . 8 % ( 209 / 1 , 567 ) ; Asian and other 8 . 6 % ( 130 / 1 , 567 ) ; data were missing on 49 tested 144 women ( data not shown ) . Comparison of race / ethnicity breakdown between SARS - CoV - 2 145 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 7 positive and negative groups revealed overrepresentation of Hispanic women in the positive 146 cohort , p < 0 . 001 . For reference , the racial / ethnic distribution of all women across three hospitals 147 admitted for delivery during the study frame was as follows : 23 . 1 % ( 480 / 2082 ) Hispanic ; 56 . 3 % 148 ( 1172 / 2082 ) non - Hispanic white , 12 . 7 % ( 265 / 2082 ) non - Hispanic black , 7 . 9 % ( 165 / 2082 ) Asian 149 and other . When evaluated as a dichotomous measure , Hispanic ethnicity was associated with 150 increased odds of moderate / severe COVID - 19 course compared to non - Hispanic ethnicity ( 18 % 151 ( 11 / 61 ) vs 3 . 8 % ( 3 / 78 ) , unadjusted OR 5 . 5 95 % CI 1 . 46 - 20 . 71 , p = 0 . 01 ) . 152 The median gestational age at diagnosis was 35 weeks for antepartum diagnoses ( IQR 153 22 - 38 . 5 ) , 39 weeks ( IQR 38 - 39 ) for asymptomatic women , and 27 . 5 ( IQR 17 - 36 ) , 35 ( IQR 30 - 154 36 ) , and 26 ( IQR 22 - 31 ) weeks for patients with mild , moderate and severe / critical disease , 155 respectively . Additional demographic information and patient characteristics are described in 156 Table 1 . The diagnosis was made antenatally in 58 . 8 % of cases ( 83 / 141 ) : 7 . 8 % ( 11 / 141 ) in the 1 st 157 trimester , 26 . 2 % ( 37 / 141 ) in the 2 nd trimester , and 24 . 8 % ( 35 / 141 ) in the 3 rd trimester . Thirty - six 158 percent of women ( 51 / 141 ) were diagnosed upon admission for childbirth . Five percent ( 7 / 141 ) 159 were diagnosed with COVID - 19 postpartum after discharge from their childbirth admission . 160 Thirty - one percent of women ( 44 / 141 ) were asymptomatic . Fifty - eight percent of women 161 ( 82 / 141 ) had mild disease ; 6 . 4 % ( 9 / 141 ) had moderate disease . Five women had severe or 162 critical disease . One woman died in the Emergency Room . This woman , with a pre - pregnancy 163 BMI of 35 kg / m 2 , was diagnosed with COVID - 19 in ambulatory care in the first trimester of 164 pregnancy . She developed respiratory distress at home 13 days after initial symptom onset and 165 arrived at the Emergency Department profoundly hypoxemic , suffering cardiac arrest and 166 ultimately died despite prolonged attempts at cardiopulmonary resuscitation . No autopsy was 167 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 8 performed . Including this case , the rate of severe / critical disease in our population was 4 . 3 % 168 ( 6 / 141 ) . Timing of the diagnoses and disease severity are reflected in Figure 1 . 169 Maternal medical comorbidities and their relation to COVID - 19 course are presented in 170 Table 1 . Severity of disease was associated with obesity , both as a dichotomous measure and by 171 obesity class ( p = 0 . 01 and p < 0 . 01 , respectively ) but not with any other co - morbidity . Obese 172 women had higher rates of moderate / severe disease than non - obese women ( 16 . 4 % ( 9 / 55 ) vs 173 3 . 8 % ( 3 / 79 ) , unadjusted OR 4 . 96 , 95 % CI 1 . 28 - 19 . 25 ) . The distribution of obesity among racial - 174 ethnic groups was as follows : Hispanic – 38 . 6 % ( 22 / 57 ) ; non - Hispanic white - 23 . 7 % ( 9 / 38 ) ; 175 non - Hispanic black – 73 . 3 % ( 22 / 30 ) ; and Asian or other – 25 % ( 2 / 8 ) , p < 0 . 001 , suggesting that 176 Hispanic ethnicity is unlikely to be solely related to the effect of obesity on clinical course of 177 COVID - 19 . Obese Hispanic women were also more likely to develop moderate and severe 178 COVID - 19 compared to non - obese Hispanic women ( 31 . 8 % ( 7 / 22 ) vs 8 . 6 % ( 3 / 35 ) , OR 4 . 98 , 179 95 % CI 1 . 13 - 21 . 98 ) . 180 Among symptomatic women , the most common symptoms in our cohort were cough 181 ( 70 . 1 % ) , muscle aches ( 51 . 6 % ) and sore throat ( 47 . 4 % ) ( Figure 2 ) . The most common symptoms 182 in women with severe disease were muscle aches , fever , shortness of breath , nausea , chest pain 183 and abdominal pain . 184 D - dimer and CRP trends , grouped by the type of admission , are presented in Figure 3 . 185 Notably , D - dimer values varied greatly within the group who tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 186 during childbirth admission . However , most had a substantial increase in D - dimer value shortly 187 after birth with a subsequent decline within 48 hours . D - dimer took longer to normalize in one 188 patient ( 5 days after delivery ) whose respiratory status deteriorated in labor necessitating 189 cesarean birth followed by ICU admission for COVID - 19 - related respiratory failure . There were 190 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 9 no cases of venous thromboembolism diagnosed during the study period . CRP also peaked after 191 delivery . Women admitted antepartum for COVID - 19 management who developed severe 192 disease appeared to have higher initial CRP values than those with milder disease . Comparison 193 between these two groups , however , did not reach statistical significance ( p = 0 . 057 ) . 194 Pregnancy outcomes were available for 56 . 7 % of women ( 80 / 141 ) ( Figure 1 and Table 195 2 ) . Notably , one woman underwent termination via dilation and evacuation at 22 weeks of 196 gestation due to severe preterm preeclampsia syndrome in the setting of COVID - 19 infection . 7 197 Ninety - five percent of pregnancies ( 76 / 80 ) resulted in a live birth , 3 of which were preterm ( 2 - 198 spontaneous , 1 – indicated by preeclampsia with severe features ) . Vaginal delivery occurred in 199 67 . 5 % ( 52 / 77 ) of cases , and cesarean in 31 . 1 % of cases ( 24 / 77 ) . One cesarean birth was 200 indicated for maternal and fetal decompensation secondary to COVID - 19 . 201 HDP affected 22 . 1 % ( 17 / 77 ) of COVID - 19 positive pregnancies . The rate of 202 preeclampsia / eclampsia / HELLP was 16 . 9 % ( 13 / 77 ) . Twelve percent of COVID - 19 positive 203 women ( 2 / 17 ) had pre - existing hypertension . For comparison , the overall rates of HDP , 204 preeclampsia / eclampsia / HELLP and pre - existing hypertension at Yale - New Haven Hospital in 205 2018 - 2019 among singleton pregnancies were 18 . 5 % ( 1601 / 8 , 691 ) , 7 . 6 % ( 668 / 8 , 691 ) and 8 . 9 % 206 ( 770 / 8 , 691 ) , respectively . 207 Nasopharyngeal swab SARS - CoV - 2 RT - PCR results for all tested newborns ( n = 60 ) were 208 negative . Placental tissue from the 22 - week termination for severe preterm preeclampsia 209 syndrome tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 RNA . 7 None of the newborns required COVID - 19 210 related ICU admission . 211 COMMENT 212 Principal Findings 213 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 10 This is a series of 141 cases of COVID - 19 in pregnant and postpartum women within a 214 diverse population of Southern Connecticut . Although the rate of severe disease in our 215 population is low ( 4 . 3 % ) , our cohort includes one maternal death . In our cohort , Hispanic women 216 were disproportionately affected by COVID - 19 and appeared to have an increased risk of 217 moderate / severe disease . This finding is unlikely to be related to a disproportionate testing in 218 Hispanic population as all three hospital sites implemented universal SARS - CoV - 2 testing upon 219 admission for childbirth . Pre - pregnancy obesity was associated with a higher disease severity 220 category . HDP affected approximately 1 out of every 5 women with COVID - 19 after 20 weeks 221 of gestation with the majority diagnosed with preeclampsia with severe features or HELLP 222 syndrome . Our study demonstrates that delivery is associated with transient increases in D - dimer 223 and CRP levels in all COVID - 19 positive women regardless of symptomatic status . D - dimer 224 returned to predelivery values within 24 - 48 hours in most women . D - dimer did not appear to be 225 a useful marker to distinguish COVID - 19 disease severity category . All newborns born to 226 COVID - 19 positive women tested negative for SARS - CoV - 2 RNA via nasopharyngeal swab 227 after 24 hours of life ; however , there was one case with positive placental SARS - CoV - 2 testing . 7 228 Results in the Context of What is Known 229 Early reports of SARS - CoV - 2 infection during pregnancy are encouraging as they failed 230 to demonstrate higher susceptibility or morbidity in pregnant women compared to the general 231 population . 8 - 11 More recent reports have described severe and critical disease in pregnancy as 232 well as maternal deaths from COVID - 19 , indicating potential for severe maternal morbidity and 233 mortality . 12 - 14 The case of maternal death in our series highlights the potential for the disease 234 course to be protracted with seemingly unpredictable and abrupt deterioration in health after 10 - 235 14 days . 15 236 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 11 One of the most important goals of the healthcare community during SARS - CoV - 2 237 pandemic is identification of populations at risk for severe disease and death . Racial and ethnic 238 disparities as risk factors for severe COVID - 19 are an emerging focus of COVID - 19 studies in 239 the United States . 16 - 19 Our data raises concern about the role of social determinants of health and 240 systemic inequities specific to SARS - CoV - 2 transmission and healthcare access . Our findings 241 are further supported by a recent study by Moore at al , which demonstrated a disproportionate 242 number of COVID - 19 cases among underrepresented racial / ethnic groups ( with Hispanic 243 population being the largest affected group ) in COVID - 19 pandemic hotspots . 20 We demonstrate 244 that pre - pregnancy obesity is associated with more severe COVID - 19 , which is consistent with 245 prior studies in non - pregnant adults and a small study of pregnant women . 13 , 21 246 In non - pregnant adults , higher D - dimer levels are associated with increased risk of 247 critical COVID - 19 course and death . 22 , 23 Anticoagulation , guided by D - dimer levels , has been 248 shown to decrease mortality in this population . 24 In both complicated and uncomplicated 249 pregnancies , however , D - dimer levels are known to increase above baseline , though reference 250 ranges are inconsistent . 25 Our study presents novel data on D - dimer trends in SARS - CoV - 2 251 positive symptomatic and asymptomatic women in relation to delivery . CRP has emerged as 252 another independent predictor of adverse outcomes in non - pregnant COVID - 19 patients 26 . Our 253 data suggests that D - dimer may not be helpful in determining disease severity in a pregnant and 254 peripartum COVID - 19 population . Its use for anticoagulation guidance needs to be further 255 evaluated . Similar to D - dimer , there are no well - established reference ranges for CRP in 256 pregnancy and there are limited data for the use of this parameter in pregnant COVID - 19 257 positive women . 27 Our data suggest that admission CRP values in antepartum women may 258 emerge as a more helpful in predicting disease severity . 259 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 12 Clinical and Research Implications 260 Overrepresentation of Hispanic women in our SARS - CoV - 2 positive cohort and concern 261 for increased severity of COVID - 19 disease in this group indicates an urgent need to further 262 characterize and address the causes of these disparities . Additional larger - scale studies are 263 needed to address the mounting evidence that racial and ethnic disparities are central to the 264 myriad factors ( e . g . health care access , housing , and ability to socially distance ) that lead to the 265 unequal distribution of SARS - CoV - 2 infection and COVID - 19 severity and mortality seen 266 throughout the United States . 16 267 The CDC guidelines include only severe obesity ( BMI > 40 mg / m 2 ) as a risk factor for 268 severe illness in the non - pregnant population while our study links pre - pregnancy BMI of ≥ 30 269 kg / m 2 with worse clinical course during pregnancy . 28 The current ACOG - SMFM COVID - 19 270 guidelines do not list obesity as a comorbidity placing pregnant women at risk for more severe 271 disease . 29 Given our findings , consideration should be made to include all classes of obesity as a 272 risk factor in pregnancy for progression to moderate and severe disease . 273 Lastly , larger studies are required to review possible association between SARS - CoV - 2 274 infection and HDP . 275 Strengths and Limitations 276 Our study was performed in a diverse health care system consisting of academic and 277 community hospitals with a racially and ethnically diverse population ; however , the study is 278 limited to a single geographic location and may not be generalizable to other regions of the 279 country with different patient populations and prevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 . Additionally , this 280 population is heterogenous with both symptomatic and asymptomatic women being tested for 281 SARS - CoV - 2 . We acknowledge that many women with symptoms were likely never tested and 282 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 13 new commercial tests performed outside of hospital labs emerged during the course of this study , 283 the results of which may have not been incorporated in the EHR and identified for review . 284 Furthermore , testing guidelines as well as management strategies evolved during the study 285 period , thus , contributing to the variation in clinical decision making . WHO COVID - 19 severity 286 assignment criteria were used for this study as this classification system was the only one 287 explicitly applicable for pregnancy at the time . Furthermore , we adjusted the oxygen saturation 288 criterion for severe disease from < 90 % on room air in non - pregnancy to < 95 % in pregnancy . 30 289 The racial and ethnic composition of the tested population may not be an accurate representation 290 of the overall pregnant population . We were unable to compare the rates of HDP in COVID - 19 291 positive and negative patients as we had limited access to the data on the latter group . CRP value 292 comparisons between COVID - 19 severity groups were limited by small sample size . We were 293 unable to perform a multivariate analysis to assess for confounding due to small sample size . 294 Lastly , unlike other literature , we failed to demonstrate associations between pre - existing 295 hypertension and diabetes with worse COVID - 19 course ; this may be due to a relatively small 296 sample size . 31 Larger registry studies are needed to examine the risk factors associated with 297 COVID - 19 progression in pregnancy . 298 Conclusions 299 This study demonstrates that the majority of pregnant women with COVID - 19 remain 300 either asymptomatic or have mild disease ; however , severe illness and death can occur . Pre - 301 pregnancy obesity was associated with an increased risk of severe illness . Further , the Hispanic 302 population in this cohort appeared to be at increased risk for severe illness . Large - scale studies 303 are required to develop better risk stratification strategies for COVID - 19 in pregnancy . 304 305 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 14 References : 306 1 .
