The ARID3A / Bright transcription factor has also been implicated in malignancies , primarily those derived from hematopoi - etic lineages . Previously , we demonstrated that ARID3A shuttles between the nucleus and the plasma membrane , where it localizes within lipid rafts . There it interacts with components of the B - cell receptor ( BCR ) to reduce its ability to transmit downstream signaling . We demonstrate here that a direct component of ARID3A - regulated BCR signal strength is cortical actin . ARID3A interacts with actin exclusively within lipid rafts via the actin - binding protein EZRIN , which conﬁnes unstimulated BCRs within lipid rafts . BCR ligation discharges the ARID3A – EZRIN complex from lipid rafts , allowing the BCR to initiate downstream signaling events . The ARID3A – EZRIN interaction occurs almost exclusively within unpolymerized G - actin , where EZRIN interacts with the multifunctional ARID3A REKLES domain . These observations provide a mechanism by which a transcription fac - tor directly regulates BCR signaling via linkage to the actin cytoskeleton with consequences for B - cell - related neoplasia . Keywords : transcriptional regulation ; lipid rafts ; actin cytoskeleton ; B - cell antigen receptor 1 . Introduction The cortical cytoskeleton is an actin - based structure that underlies and confers me - chanical support to the plasma membrane ( PM ) via a dense meshwork ( about 100 nm thick ) comprised primarily of ﬁlamentous ( F ) actin [ 1 ] . An array of proteins , including myosin motors as well as actin - binding and linker factors , comprise the PM [ 2 ] . The cortex is dynamic in that it can locally disassemble ( globular ( G ) - actin ) and reassemble ( F - actin ) to drive the formation of cellular protrusions and to modulate lipid microdomain ( lipid raft ) organization [ 3 , 4 ] . PM - associated receptors maintain dynamic contacts with the cortex via linker proteins that simultaneously bind actin and the cytoplasmic domains of PM proteins [ 5 ] . The resulting receptor – cytoskeleton anchoring has a direct impact on receptor mobility and inﬂuences receptor function [ 6 ] . Over 100 actin - binding proteins constitute the cortical cytoskeleton [ 1 ] . In resting B cells , the mobility of B - cell antigen receptors ( BCRs ) is restricted , as the cortical actin cytoskeleton acts as a barrier to their diffusion [ 7 , 8 ] . Such contractile stress and tension is mediated by ERM proteins ( EZRIN , RADIXIN , and MOESIN ) [ 9 , 10 ] . ERM proteins supply the tension needed to anchor BCRs in the cortex . Actin and EZRIN form a network which conﬁnes BCRs in nanoscale lipid rafts via EZRIN carboxyl terminal binding to integral membrane proteins of the BCR complex [ 11 ] . BCR mobility , on the other hand , is established if the EZRIN – actin interaction is disrupted [ 12 ] . Diseases 2021 , 9 , 22 . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 3390 / diseases9010022 https : / / www . mdpi . com / journal / diseases Diseases 2021 , 9 , 22 2 of 16 Besides its mechanical functions , actin has also been implicated in transcriptional regulation—both through cytoplasmic alterations in cytoskeletal actin dynamics and through the assembly of transcription factor ( TF ) regulatory complexes [ 13 ] . Established ex - amples include the subcellular localization of myocardin - related TFs ( MAL , MKL1 , BSAC , and MRTF - B ) [ 14 , 15 ] , the PREP2 homeoprotein TF , and the TF repressor YY1 [ 16 , 17 ] . Lymphoma and other immunological diseases , including autoimmune disorders , can derail the normal activation of B cells via impairment of the actin cytoskeleton . These include Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome ( WAS ) , an immunodeﬁciency disease resulting from deﬁciency of WASP or WASP - interacting protein ( WIP ) —both critical actin regulators in hematopoietic cells [ 18 , 19 ] . Diffuse large B - cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) is also highly associ - ated with elevated levels of phosphorylated actin - binding proteins , including ERMs [ 20 ] . Likewise , defects that alter CD19 and other BCR co - stimulatory receptor expression or alterations in intracellular signaling thresholds / strength can lead to disease states . For example , autoimmune diseases often derive from the ﬂawed regulation of B - cell responses which result in the emergence of high - afﬁnity autoreactive B cells , autoantibody production , and tissue damage ( reviewed in [ 21 ] ) . We observed [ 22 ] that a palmitoylated pool of ARID3A , a TF restricted to B cells / embryonic stem cells , shuttles from the nucleus to the PM where it is diverted to lipid rafts of resting B cells to associate with “signalosome” components . The BCR signalosome requires the participation of signaling proteins ( e . g . , BTK and BLNK ) whose genetic defects often impair B - cell activation , differentiation , and often lead to agammaglobulinemia [ 11 , 12 ] . Following BCR stimulation , ARID3A transiently interacts with SUMOylation enzymes , blocks calcium flux and phospho - rylation of BTK and TFII - I TFs , and is then discharged from lipid rafts as a SUMO - I - modified form [ 22 ] . The lipid raft concentration of ARID3A contributes to the signaling threshold of B cells , as their sensitivity to BCR stimulation decreases as the levels of ARID3A increase [ 22 ] . These events are independent of the previously established role of nuclear ARID3A in im - munoglobulin gene transcription [ 23 ] . Here we demonstrate that actin is a critical component underlying ARID3A - regulated BCR signal strength . ARID3A interacts with actin exclusively within lipid rafts via the actin - binding protein EZRIN , which in unstimulated BCRs is conﬁned within lipid rafts . We observed that antigen binding discharged the ARID3A – EZRIN complex from lipid rafts , allowing the initiation of downstream signaling events . Consistent with the timing of EZRIN discharge , ARID3A – EZRIN interaction occurred almost exclusively within unpolymerized G - actin , and was mediated by the multifunctional REKLES domain of ARID3A . Along with our previous data , this provides further mechanistic insight into how ARID3A can directly regulate BCR signaling via association with the actin cytoskeleton . Our results further suggest that ARID3A deregulation may underlie BCR - actin - associated immunological diseases . 2 . Results 2 . 1 . Variable Levels of ARID3A within Lipid Rafts in Unstimulated and Stimulated B - Cell Lymphomas From B - cell leukemias / lymphomas , we prepared whole - cell lysates ( WCLs ) as pre - viously described [ 22 ] . Lipid rafts were prepared by ﬂotation on discontinuous sucrose gradients [ 22 ] using the B - cell - speciﬁc lipid rafts component Raﬂin [ 24 ] as an internal con - trol for purity ( Materials and Methods ) ( Figure S1A ) . Plasma membranes ( PMs ) , isolated as pellets from the same raft extraction , were further puriﬁed for 30 min on ice as described in the Materials and Methods . The purity of the lipid raft and plasma membrane preparations was demonstrated by the fact that neither GM130 ( a member of the Golgi family ) nor lamin B ( a member of the nuclear envelope complex ) were detectable in the preparations ( Figure S1B ) . As shown in Figure S1C , lipid rafts isolated from human transformed cell lines repre - sentative of a mature B - cell lineage ( Raji , Ramos , CL - 01 and Daudi ) displayed detectable but consistently variable levels of ARID3A . Notably , rafts from Raji and Daudi cells ( lanes 1 and 3 ) contained lower amounts of ARID3A compared to those from Ramos and CL - 01 Diseases 2021 , 9 , 22 3 of 16 cells ( lanes 2 and 4 ) . Equal loading was demonstrated by probing the blots with anti - Raftlin antiserum . Semi - quantitative densitometry ( Materials and Methods ) indicated that ~ 1 % ( Raji and Daudi ) vs . ~ 10 % ( Ramos and CL - 01 ) of total ARID3A partitioned within rafts , and that raft - localized ARID3A accounted for < 10 % of total cellular ARID3A—a value similar to the previously estimated level of membrane ( m ) IgM in lipid rafts [ 25 , 26 ] . Equal loading was demonstrated by probing the blots with anti - Raftlin . The differences among these lines in raft - localized ARID3A made them excellent choices for our analyses of BCR signaling strength . 2 . 2 . BCR Stimulation Induces a Rafts - Restricted , Transient Interaction of ARID3A with EZRIN Prior to Their Co - Discharge We previously demonstrated that Ramos and CL - 01 were less sensitive , whereas Raji and Daudi were more sensitive to BCR stimulation , as judged by the downstream production of tyrosine phosphorylation and Ca 2 + mobilization [ 22 ] . We further showed that the engagement of the BCR results in a signiﬁcant and speciﬁc reduction of the small pool of lipid - rafts - localized ARID3A , which is lost from lipid rafts as BTK and other signalosome components accumulate there in proportion to BCR signaling strength [ 22 ] . The fact that the cytoskeletal linker protein EZRIN undergoes a similar anti - IgM - mediated discharge from lipid rafts [ 11 , 12 ] prompted us to examine ARID3A – EZRIN interaction under differential BCR signal strength conditions . As shown in Figure 1 , we observed that EZRIN and ARID3A did not form an immunoprecipitable complex in WCLs of any of the B - cell lines , regardless of whether the cells were stimulated ( Figure 1A ( a – c ) , lanes 5 , 6 , 11 , 12 , 17 , 18 , 23 , and 24 ) . However , EZRIN and ARID3A did associate within lipid rafts , and their interaction required BCR stimulation ( compare lanes 7 and 19 with lanes 8 and 20 in Figure 1A ( a , b ) ) . EZRIN was co - discharged with ARID3A as evidenced by their identical trafﬁcking . That is , EZRIN was detected in anti - ARID3A IPs of lipid rafts of the higher - threshold cell lines ( Ramos and CL - 01 ) stimulated with anti - IgM only ( Figure 1A ( a ) , lanes 8 and 20 ) ; within all cell lines stimulated with anti - CD19 only ( Figure 1A ( b ) , lanes 2 , 8 , 14 , and 20 ) ; and discharged in all cell lines following anti - IgM + anti - CD19 stimulation ( Figure 1A ( c ) , lanes 2 , 8 , 14 , and 20 ) ( Figure S2 ) . Notably , EZRIN was retained in the membrane fraction only following strong co - stimulation ( Figure 1A ( c ) , lanes 4 , 10 , 16 , and 22 ) . We observed no change in the expression levels of SUMO - 1 , which modiﬁes ARID3A at a single lysine residue and interacts with ARID3A in rafts ( 22 ; Figure S3 ) . These results suggest that post - discharge , the ARID3A – EZRIN complex is directed to different fates depending on the signaling threshold of the BCR . 2 . 3 . EZRIN Knockdown Results in Reduced BCR Signaling Strength The above results suggest that , within lipid rafts , EZRIN might link ARID3A indirectly to the BCR to control signaling strength . Thus , we tested if signal strength was impaired following strong ( anti - IgM + anti - CD19 ) stimulation in B cells deﬁcient in EZRIN . Retroviral shRNA knockdown of EZRIN was performed in each of the four lym - phoma / leukemia lines . ImageJ analysis conﬁrmed each KD to be robust ( 75 – 90 % relative to a scrambled sh - RNA KD control ; Figure S4 ) . EZRIN wild - type ( WT ) and KD B - cell leukemias / lymphomas were then loaded with Indo - 1 , incubated with an Fc γ III / II receptor - blocking Ab ( to prevent Ab – Ag immune complexes ) , and then strongly stimulated with anti - CD19 + F ( ab (cid:48) ) 2 - IgM 30 s rior to the measurement of Ca 2 + ﬂux . Cells were gated , and representative results of three separate experiments assessed via the Acapella Kinetic In - tensity Analysis script ( Materials and Methods ) are shown in Figure 1B . EZRIN loss led to signiﬁcant reduction ( p ≤ 0 . 05 ; * ) in the signaling strength of the more sensitive Raji and Daudi B cells as compared to the less - sensitive Ramos and CL - 01 B cells . That is , ~ 38 % of Raji and Daudi responded to strong BCR stimulation as compared to ~ 12 % of Ramos and CL - 01 , as judged by ImageJ analysis . Diseases 2021 , 9 , 22 4 of 16 These data led us to speculate that the ARID3A – EZRIN complex might function to secure the raft environment for the active BCR or to prepare inactive BCR complexes for signaling activity . They further implied that the inherent signaling strength of the BCR , in the absence of EZRIN , may contribute in a feedback manner by directing the ultimate fates of ARID3A – EZRIN complexes within the actin cytoskeleton—a hypothesis tested below . Diseases 2021 , 9 , x FOR PEER REVIEW 4 of 17 Figure 1 . The ARID3A – EZRIN complex is directed to different fates depending on the signaling threshold of the B - cell receptors ( BCRs ) .

Lipid rafts ( Raft ) , plasma membranes ( Memb ) , and whole - cell lysates ( WCLs ) were analyzed following anti - ARID3A IP and Western blotting with anti - EZRIN . EZRIN – ARID3A did not co - IP in either stimulated or unstimulated WLCs ( lanes 5 , 6 , 11 , 12 , 17 , 18 , 23 , and 24 ) but did within BCR - stimulated lipid rafts ( lanes 8 and 20 ( panels a and c ) . ARID3A – EZRIN co - immuno - precipitated in lipid rafts of the higher threshold cell lines ( Ramos and CL - 01 ) stimulated with anti - IgM only ( a , lanes 8 and 20 ) ; within all cell lines stimulated with anti - CD19 only ( b , lanes 2 , 8 , 14 , and 20 ) ; and were discharged in all cell lines following anti - IgM + anti - CD19 stimulation ( c , lanes 2 , 8 , 14 , and 20 ) . EZRIN was retained in the PM only following strong co - stimulation ( c , lanes 4 , 10 , 16 , and 22 ) . B . EZRIN knockdown ( KD ) resulted in reduced signaling strength . EZRIN levels were reduced by shRNA knockdown ( KD ; Materials and Methods ) , and calcium ( Ca 2 + ) flux was measured in the indicated B - cell tumors of high or low signaling strength following strong costimulation , as detailed in Materials and Methods . Data shown are representative of three inde - pendent experiments . α - IgM and α - CD19 were added 30 s ( upward arrow ) before the beginning of the experiment , and the cells were analyzed at 250 cells / s . Results are plotted as the mean calcium concentration vs . time . A significant difference ( p ≤ 0 . 05 * ) was determined among high - vs . low - signaling cells when comparing their calcium response to stimulation with and without EZRIN knockdown .

Notably , EZRIN was retained in the membrane fraction only following strong co - stimulation ( Figure 1A ( c ) , lanes 4 , 10 , 16 , and 22 ) . We observed no change in the expression levels of SUMO - 1 , which modifies ARID3A at a single lysine residue and interacts with ARID3A in rafts ( 22 ; Figure S3 ) . These results suggest that post - discharge , the ARID3A – EZRIN complex is directed to different fates depending on the signaling threshold of the BCR . Figure 1 . ( A ) .

ARID3A Interacts via EZRIN with Actin in Leukemic Cell Lines and in Normal Murine B Cells Previous reports established that EZRIN binds speciﬁcally to F - actin polymers [ 11 , 12 ] and that partial depolymerization of actin increases the strength of BCR signaling [ 27 ] . This and the data above suggested that EZRIN mediates the BCR ligation - dependent aggregation of lipid rafts by releasing them from the underlying cortical actin cytoskeleton . As shown in Figure 2A , actin and ARID3A co - immunoprecipitated in lipid rafts of all unstimulated B - cell lines ( lanes 1 , 5 , 9 , and 13 ) . Strong stimulation with anti - IgM + anti CD19 ( lanes 4 , 8 , 12 , and 16 ) discharged ARID3A from actin in the lipid rafts of all cells . Weaker stimulation with either anti - CD19 or anti - IgM discharged actin from ARID3A in the lipid rafts of B cells with high signaling strength ( Raji and Daudi ; lanes 2 , 3 , 14 , and 15 ) , but not from B cells with weak signaling strength ( Ramos and CL - 01 ; lanes 6 , 7 , 10 , and 11 ) . Strong stimulation ( Figure 2A ; lanes 4 , 6 , 12 and 16 ) was required to discharge other ARID3A - interacting proteins [ 22 ] , including UBC - 9 , PIAS - 1 , and SUMO - I . Diseases 2021 , 9 , x FOR PEER REVIEW 6 of 17 Figure 2 . Interaction and discharge of ARID3A – actin complexes within lipid rafts as a function of BCR signal strength . ( A ) ARID3A co - immunoprecipitated with αβ - actin in the lipid rafts of B - cell lines ( lanes 1 , 5 , 9 , and 13 ) regardless of their signaling strength . Strong stimulation ( α - IgM + α - CD19 ; lanes 4 , 8 , 12 , and 16 ) discharged ARID3A from actin in the lipid rafts of all cells , whereas weaker stimulation ( α - CD19 or α - IgM ) discharged actin from ARID3A in lipid rafts of strong ( Raji and Daudi ; lanes 2 , 3 , 14 , and 15 ) , but not weak ( Ramos and CL - 01 ; lanes 6 , 7 , 10 , and 11 ) signaling strength B cells . Strong stimulation ( lanes 4 , 8 , 12 , and 16 ) was required to discharge other ARID3A - interacting proteins ( UBC - 9 , PIAS - 1 , and SUMOI ) from lipid rafts . ( B ) Triple immunoflu - orescence of murine B cells stained for actin ( green ) , ARID3A ( red ) , and nuclei ( blue ) revealed strong actin – ARID3A association ( yellow ; also illustrated in Figure S5 and Supplementary Videos 1 and 2 ) . Scale bar , 5 µm . The fact that ARIA3A was detected in lipid rafts implied it was discharged after strong stimulation . However , our data do not exclude whether other unknown proteins were also discharged , as no Abs against these putative factors were employed . Next , we employed normal murine follicular ( FO ) B cells to test whether ARID3A interacts with EZRIN , with actin , or with both . Further , we asked whether either or both of these interactions , as demonstrated in B - cell lymphomas ( Figure 2A ) , were dependent upon the signaling strength of the BCR . As shown in Figure S2A , B , equal inputs of ARID3A and EZRIN within FO WCLs were stimulated as detailed above with either α - IgM , α - CD19 , or α - IgM + α - CD19 and then employed as inputs for Co - IP analyses . Anti - ARID3A immunoprecipitates were fractionated on SDS - PAGE and then blotted with ei - ther anti - EZRIN or anti - αβ - actin ( Figure S2C , D , respectively ) . We observed that both EZRIN and actin interacted with ARID3A most avidly following strong signaling via α - IgM + α - CD19 . Figure 2 .

Finally , support for an ARID3A - actin interaction was provided by immunoﬂuores - cence data ( stains and microscopy detailed in the Materials and Methods ) . Strong stimula - tion ( anti - IgM + anti - CD19 ) was observed in FO B cells , which were stained for actin ( green ) , ARID3A ( red ) , and nuclei ( blue ) . The image in Figure 2B reveals signiﬁcant levels of actin - ARID3A overlap ( yellow ) . More deﬁnitive data was provided by the higher - resolution modulated polarization microscopy ( MPM ) ( Figure S5 ; Movies S1 and S2 ) . MPM measures cytoskeletal ﬁlaments based on their birefringence , and differs from standard polarization microscopy by exploiting the angle dependence of birefringence . Collectively , the data suggest that ARID3A interacts with actin which , as previously demonstrated [ 11 , 12 ] , interacts with EZRIN . However , the data neither identify the stoi - chiometry nor whether ARID3A interacts directly with actin , with EZRIN , or with both . 2 . 5 . ARID3A Localizes within Monomeric G - Actin We reasoned that a functional consequence of ARID3A discharge is the release of lipid - rafts - associated actin , either for depolymerization or for polymerization . The degree to which release is achieved might contribute to the signaling threshold of the BCR . In nonmuscle cells of mammals , actin is encoded by two genes , Actb and Actg1 , which respectively encode beta - actin and gamma - actin [ 28 – 30 ] . Each isoform can exist as a monomer , termed globular ( G ) - actin , or as a polymer , ﬁlamentous ( F ) - actin [ 31 , 32 ] . Changes in actin organization are driven by the assembly and disassembly of F - actin . This dynamic turnover is regulated by a diverse set of proteins , many of which bind to F - actin to inﬂuence the network architecture [ 31 , 32 ] . Following transfection of ARID3A into COS7 cells , we employed Triton X - 100 with or without Tween 20 fractionation to obtain detergent - soluble ( enriched in G - actin ) and insoluble ( enriched in F - actin ) proteins as described in the Materials and Methods . Tween 20 is a surfactant typically employed to decrease background staining and enhance reagent spreading in manual procedures . Following lysate fractionation over SDS - PAGE , Western blotting was performed to determine the partitioning of ARID3A and EZRIN . Acid sphingomyelinase ( SMPD1 ) served as a positive control for the insoluble ( IS ) fraction , and levels of input were adjusted using a pan - actin Ab that reacts equally with both forms . Unexpectedly , given that the vast majority of actin - binding proteins associate with F - actin [ 30 , 31 ] , ARID3A partitioned almost exclusively within the unpolymerized , G - actin soluble fraction ( Figure 3A ) . These unexpected results encouraged us to analyze actin - associated partitioning of a highly conserved ARID3A paralogue , ARID3C [ 33 ] . ARID3C is signiﬁcantly condensed relative to ARID3A ( Figures S6 and S7 ) , but ARID3C shares all functional domains and undergoes nuclear - cytoplasmic shuttling , with a fraction of ARID3C also localizing within lipid rafts following BCR stimulation [ 33 ] . These shared features provided the opportunity to readily and more broadly investigate essential sequences required for G - actin partition - ing . Indeed , we observed ARID3C partitioning into the soluble fraction ( Figure 3A ) .

This dynamic turnover is regulated by a diverse set of proteins , many of which bind to F - actin to influ - ence the network architecture [ 31 , 32 ] . Following transfection of ARID3A into COS7 cells , we employed Triton X - 100 with or without Tween 20 fractionation to obtain detergent - soluble ( enriched in G - actin ) and insoluble ( enriched in F - actin ) proteins as described in the Materials and Methods . Tween 20 is a surfactant typically employed to decrease background staining and enhance rea - gent spreading in manual procedures . Following lysate fractionation over SDS - PAGE , Western blotting was performed to determine the partitioning of ARID3A and EZRIN . Acid sphingomyelinase ( SMPD1 ) served as a positive control for the insoluble ( IS ) fraction , and levels of input were adjusted using a pan - actin Ab that reacts equally with both forms . Unexpectedly , given that the vast majority of actin - binding proteins associate with F - actin [ 30 , 31 ] , ARID3A partitioned almost exclusively within the unpolymerized , G - actin soluble fraction ( Figure 3A ) . Figure 3 . ARID3A and the related paralogue ARID3C localize within monomeric globular ( G ) - actin via the conserved REKLES - β domain . ( A ) ARID3A and 3C transfected COS7 lysates were processed via Triton X - 100 and / or TritonX - 100 + Tween 20 fractionation into insoluble ( IS , ﬁlamentous ( F ) - actin ) or soluble ( S , G - actin ) proteins . After fractionation by SDS - PAGE , samples were Western blotted with the indicated Abs ; anti - SMPD1 served as an IS positive control and actin inputs were equalized with pan - actin . ARID3A and 3C partitioned primarily within the G - actin fraction . ( B ) Loss of the REKLES domain ( ARID3A - d ( 521541 ) and ARID3C ∆ 6 ) , but not SUMO - I binding motifs ( ARID3A - K402A or ARID3C - K284A ) abolished partitioning into the soluble G - actin fraction . ( C ) A region within REKLES - β ( amino acids 532 – 540 and indicated on Figure S6B ) contains a cluster of conserved residues ( G532 , Y535 , G537 , and L539 ) whose point mutation signiﬁcantly reduced or abolished ARID3A association with G - actin . ( D ) Bacterially puriﬁed ARID3A segregated within soluble G - actin . Left : SDS - PAGE Coomassie - stained image of bacterial ARID3A following puriﬁcation as detailed in the Materials and Methods . Right : SDS - PAGE Western blot of TX - 100 soluble ( S ) and insoluble ( IS ) fractions blotted with the indicated probes . SMPD1 , marker for the insoluble fraction ; γβ - actin , loading control . Alternatively , co - fractionation of ARID3A and 3C within G - actin might owe , at least in part , to the fact that higher detergent concentration releases them into fully soluble protein pool independently of actin . Deletions might render the ARID proteins less soluble , rather than disrupting their association with actin . We did not experience any obvious solubility issues while working with this system , but to more conclusively rule out this possibility , we employed bacterially puriﬁed ARID3A in an in vitro reaction with puriﬁed F - and G - actin . As shown in Figure 3D , we observed virtually exclusive segregation of ARID3A within the G - actin soluble fraction . 2 . 6 . SUMO Modiﬁcation Does Not Control ARID3 Partitioning within G - Actin We previously demonstrated that for BCR signaling , ARID3A required SUMOylation at a single conserved lysine residue ( K402 ) in order to exit lipid rafts ( [ 22 ] ; Figure S5C ) . ARID3C requires SUMOylation of the equivalent K284 for raft exit [ 33 ] . As shown in Figure 3B , both ARID3A - K402A and ARID3C - K284A fractionated primarily within the soluble fraction . Thus , the results suggest that SUMOylation plays no major role in G - actin association . The REKLES - β domain is essential for ARID3A association within G - actin . The REKLES domain is named for a hexapeptide ( boxed in Figure S6A ) that is conserved among all ARID paralogues [ 34 , 35 ] . ARID3C encodes an additional splice variant ( termed ARID3C ∆ 6 ) which lacks the C - terminal portion of exon 6—the strongly conserved protein – protein interaction region ( Figure S7 ) . ARID3C ∆ 6 fails to undergo nuclear - cytoplasmic shuttling , and it does not associate with ARID3A in solution [ 33 ] . Yet , it does bind to Diseases 2021 , 9 , 22 8 of 16 common ARID3A DNA - binding sites in vitro [ 33 ] . As shown in Figure 3B , loss of this portion of the REKLES domain resulted in transfer of ARID3C ∆ 6 to the insoluble fraction . Sequence alignments allow the REKLES domain to be divided into three sub - domains : a conserved 17 amino acid N - terminal REKLES - α , a relatively conserved 51 amino acid spacer region , and a highly conserved 59 amino acid C - terminal REKLES - β domain ( Figure S6A , B ) . REKLES - α is required for nuclear localization ( NLS ) and REKLES - β is essential for nuclear export ( NES ) [ 22 , 33 ] . REKLES - β is also essential for ARID3A and ARID3C heteromeric interactions [ 35 ] . The ARID3C ∆ 6 observation suggested that the corresponding region of ARID3A , the REKLES - β domain , is critical for ARID3A residence within G - actin . To test this , we ﬁrst determined if ARID3A carrying a complete deletion ( d ) ( amino acids 500 – 562 ; Figure S5C ) of the 63 residue REKLES - β was also transferred to the soluble G - actin fraction . Accordingly , only ~ 40 % of REKLES β - deﬁcient d500 – 562 remained within the G - actin fraction . REKLES - β amino acids 521 – 541 contain a cluster of residues ( G532 , Y535 , G537 , and L539 ) conserved in all ARID3 paralogues ( Figure S6B ; [ 27 ] ) . Alanine substitutions within each abolished G - actin soluble fraction association to varying degrees . 2 . 7 . The REKLES - β Domain Is Essential for EZRIN – ARID3A Interaction The data above suggested that ARID3A interaction within PM G - actin is mediated through its REKLES - β subdomain , potentially via interaction with the cytoskeletal linker protein EZRIN . This hypothesis was tested by the Co - IP experiments of Figure 4 . We transfected COS7 cells with full - length ARID3A ( residues 1 – 601 ) or with each of the following REKLES mutations : d453 – 500 , in which the entire REKLES domain is deleted ( d ) ; d500 – 521 , in which the C - terminal 21 residues of the spacer , located just N - terminal to the REKLES - β domain , are deleted ; t1 – 541 , in which ARID3A is truncated just N - terminal to REKLES - β ; and d521 – 541 , in which the REKLES - β domain is deleted ( Figure 4A ) .

Transfected lysates were immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal anti - ARID3A Ab which was previously shown to pull down each of the input mutants [ 34 – 36 ] . After adjusting for equivalent levels of immunoprecipitated ARID3A inputs ( Figure 4B , middle panel ) , WT and mutant lysates were fractionated on SDS - PAGE and then Western blotted with an EZRIN monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) . As shown in Figure 4B , EZRIN – ARID3A interaction was abrogated only by deletion of the REKLES - β domain and N - terminal proximal section of the spacer region . Collectively these results indicate that ARID3A is tethered to G - actin via interaction of its RECKLES - β and proximal spacer domain with EZRIN . 3 . Discussion To our knowledge , ARID3A was the ﬁrst TF shown to function in lipid rafts [ 22 ] , but its residence there is not unprecedented . Both STAT1 and STAT3 [ 37 ] as well as an isoform of the IgH coactivator OCA - B [ 38 , 39 ] localize to lipid rafts . Several other TFs , including TFII - I , form cytoplasmic complexes [ 14 – 17 ] . That TFs function directly or as intermediates in receptor signaling is supported by the association of p35 - OcaB with galectin - 1 [ 40 ] and , in this report , ARID3A with EZRIN . Previous reports suggested that EZRIN binds speciﬁcally to F - actin , which in turn increases BCR signaling strength by aggregating and releasing lipid rafts from the cortical actin cytoskeleton [ 11 , 12 ] . Here we extend these results with the observation that an ARID3A – EZRIN – G - actin complex occurred exclusively within lipid rafts which was co - discharged from rafts following BCR stimulation ( Figures 1 and 2 , and Figure S2 ) . Our data further indicate that , within lipid rafts , EZRIN links ARID3A indirectly to the cytoskeleton to control BCR signaling strength ( Figures 1 and 2 ) . We observed signiﬁcant but relatively subtle difference in Ca 2 + ﬂuxes among strong and weak signaling lines following EZRIN KD ( Figure 1B ) . Follow - up experiments em - ploying an NFAT - driven luciferase reporter assay might provide a more sensitive means of quantifying the impact of the EZRIN loss on Ca 2 + signaling . In addition , it would be useful to knock out ARID3A in each of the B - cell lines ( using CRISPR / Cas9 ) and to examine the effect on BCR signaling via Ca 2 + mobilization and time courses of whole - cell protein tyrosine phosphorylation as readouts . ARID3A mutant constructs ( e . g . , EZRIN non - binding or lipid raft non - localizing ) could then be transfected into the KO cells to investigate how EZRIN binding and lipid raft localization impact on ARID3A’s ﬁne - tuning of BCR signaling . We observed that ARID3A associated almost exclusively with unpolymerized G - actin ( Figure 3A , B ) . This was unanticipated , as the majority of actin - binding proteins analyzed in this manner in the literature associate with F - actin [ 30 , 31 ] . The interaction requires a patch of ﬁve residues conserved among ARID3 paralogues within the 59 - residue carboxyl terminal ( β subregion ) of the multifunctional REKLES domain ( Figure S6B ) . In addition , REKLES - β , as well as the C - terminal 21 residues of the REKLES - αβ spacer , are required to link ARID3A to EZRIN ( Figure 4B ) . We suggest that future microscopic investigation of these interactions in leukemic cells would prove beneﬁcial , as the majority of the data in the manuscript derive from these tumors . Our results add another layer of complexity to the ARID3A REKLES domain . The REKLES - α subregion encodes an NLS and a binding site for SUMO - I , whereas its β subre - gion provides essential residues for nuclear export as well as for heteromeric interactions with EZRIN , BTK , PIAS - 1 , and UBC9 [ 22 , 34 , 35 ] . The three - dimensional structure of the DNA - binding domain of ARID3A has been solved [ 41 , 42 ] , yet the structure of REKLES remains to be determined . The observed extent of REKLES’ multifunctionality as well Diseases 2021 , 9 , 22 10 of 16 as the architecture of the platform tethering G - actin to the REKLES – EZRIN complex is a future goal of our research . We combined several of these features into the model in Figure 4C . We suggest that a functional consequence of ARID3A discharge from lipid rafts is the release of lipid - rafts - associated G - actin for polymerization to F - actin . The extent to which this release is achieved contributes to the signaling threshold of the BCR . Conversely , reassembly of the polymerized F - actin cytoskeleton might act to stabilize interactions among the BCR and additional signaling molecules via trapping the lipid - raft - localized signaling complex . In support of this , Total Internal Reﬂection Fluorescent Microscopy TIRFM studies ( capable of observing the BCR , actin , and EZRIN simultaneously ) revealed EZRIN – actin networks in resting B cells [ 43 ] . That Ag – Ab binding induces transient EZRIN dephosphorylation followed by detachment of lipid rafts from the actin cytoskeleton [ 39 ] is consistent with our observations ( Figures 1 and 2 ) in respect to the promotion of BCR – lipid raft interactions . However , the stoichiometry and formation kinetics of the ARID3A – EZRIN – actin complex remains to be determined . We found it interesting in this regard that ARID3A and EZRIN share a binding partner , S100P . Dimeric S100P binds to and activates EZRIN by unmasking its F - actin binding sites [ 44 ] , whereas monomeric S100P represses the DNA - binding and transactivation activity of ARID3A [ 36 ] . We feel that further experimental reﬁnement of our model is justiﬁed from a health perspective . ARID3A dysregulation is implicated in several malignancies—primarily those derived from hematopoietic lineage cells [ 45 ] . For example , diffuse large B - cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) presents both as activated B - cell ( ABC ) and germinal center B - cell ( GC ) subtypes , with the former being far more penetrant [ 46 ] . Both ARID3A and phosphorylated actin - binding proteins , including ERMs , are highly expressed in ABC - DLBCL [ 27 , 46 ] . While far less is known about ARID3C [ 47 ] , RNA - Seq analyses recently identiﬁed it within a signaling complex consisting of protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type R ( PTPRR ) , α - catenin , β - catenin , and E - cadherin that form exclusively in ovarian cancer [ 48 ] . Several members of the actin - nucleating WAVE complex , including BRK1 , BRICK1 , and SCAR / WAVE , are direct , upregulated transcriptional targets of ARID3A , as determined by the ENCODE ChIP - seq project [ 49 ] . WAVE proteins play diverse roles , ranging from BCR activation [ 50 – 52 ] to cancer invasion and metastasis [ 53 , 54 ] . ARID3A direct transactivation of PFN1 , a member of the proﬁlin family of small actin - binding proteins , is an essential regulator of actin polymerization in response to BCR ligation [ 55 ] . PFN1 has also been characterized as a tumor - suppressor in human breast cancer [ 56 ] . These data suggest that modulation of EZRIN , ARID3A , and potentially ARID3C may provide both prognostic and therapeutic options for these and other malignancies . 4 . Materials and Methods 4 . 1 . Cell Lines Raji ( EBV + , Cat . No . CCL - 86 ) , Daudi ( EBV + ; Cat . No . CCL - 213 ) , and Ramos ( EBV − ; Cat . No . CSC - C1015 ) [ 57 – 59 ] were obtained from ATCC ( Manassas , VA , USA ) ; CL - 01 ( EBV − ; Cat . No . NBP1 - 49595 ) [ 60 ] was obtained from Novus Biologicals , LLC ( Centennial , CO , USA ) . Each was maintained as previously described [ 22 ] . Cells were grown and main - tained in either Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle medium ( DMEM ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ; Invitrogen , Waltham , MA , USA ) or in RPMI medium containing 10 % FBS . CD43 - B cells were prepared by negative selection of whole human blood ( Gulf Coast Regional Blood Center , Houston , TX , USA ) or from 10 - wk BALB / c murine splenocytes . 4 . 2 . Constructs Mutant forms of ARID3A and ARID3C used in this study were generated previously by site - directed mutagenesis [ 22 , 33 – 35 ] . Diseases 2021 , 9 , 22 11 of 16 4 . 3 . Preparation of Stable sh - RNA Retrovirally Transduced B - Cell Lines Stable transductants were established by employment of the Phoenix - A retroviral sys - tem . Approximately 3 × 10 5 amphitropic Phoenix - A packaging cells in 4 mL of DMEM were supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) in 60 mm plates . After one day of culture , cells were transfected using FuGene6 , and viral supernatant was harvested 2 days post - transfection , centrifuged , and ﬁltered to remove live cells and debris . The target cell lines de - scribed above were plated ( ~ 3 × 10 5 ) onto 60 - mm plates and growth medium was replaced with viral mixture . To introduce EZRIN - knockdown sequences , we used oligos ordered from Integrated DNA Technologies with restriction site overhangs BbsI and XhoI ( sense , 5 (cid:48) - ACCGGCCGTGGAGAGAGAGAAAGATTCAAGAGATCTTTCTCTCTCTCCACGGCT TTTTTACCGGTC - 3 (cid:48) ; anti - sense , 5 (cid:48) - TCGAGACCGGTAAAAAAGCCGTGGAGAGAGAGA AAGATCTCTTGAATCTTTCTCTCTCTCCACGGC - 3 (cid:48) ) . Stable lines were established by selection with 2 µ g / mL of puromycin from day 2 post - infection . 4 . 4 . B - Cell Stimulation To measure signaling effects at low doses of anti - IgM where receptor internalization is minimized , we used monoclonal anti - IgM Abs in the absence of secondary crosslinking . To stimulate B cells , 500 ng of F ( ab’ ) 2 fragments of α - µ ( clone JDC - 15 ; Dako ( α - human ) ; OB1022 ; Southern Biotech ( α - mouse ) ) and α - CD19 ( clone HD37 ; Dako ( α - human ) ; clone SJ25 - C1 ( α - mouse ) ) were added to ~ 5 × 10 8 cells for 5 min at 37 ◦ C . We determined by FACS analysis and semi - quantitative Western blotting of lipid - raft - associated membrane ( m ) IgM ( Figure S1 ; [ 22 ] ) that under these conditions 1 – 5 % of mIgM in rafts and membranes are engaged . 4 . 5 . Preparation of Lipid Rafts Approximately 500 mg of wet cell pellet was washed twice in ice - cold phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) and homogenized in 5 mL of 10 mM Tris / Cl ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 1 mM EDTA , 250 mM sucrose , 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride , and 1 µ g / mL leupeptin ( all from Sigma , St Louis , MO , USA ) in a tightly ﬁtted Dounce homogenizer using ﬁve strokes . The resulting homogenate was centrifuged at 900 × g for 10 min at 4 ◦ C , and the supernatant was then subjected to centrifugation at 110 , 000 × g for 90 min at 4 ◦ C . The resulting membrane pellet was resuspended in ice - cold 500 µ L TNE buffer ( 10 mM Tris / Cl ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM EDTA , 1 % Triton X - 100 ( Sigma ) , 10 × protease inhibitors ( Complete tablets , Roche , Indianapolis , IN , USA ) ) . Sucrose gradients for the preparation of lipid rafts were assembled as previously described [ 18 ] . Lipid rafts were isolated by ﬂotation on discontinuous sucrose gradients . Membrane pellets were extracted for 30 min on ice in TNE buffer . For the discontinuous sucrose gradient , 1 mL of cleared supernatant was mixed with 1 mL of 85 % sucrose in TNE and transferred to the bottom of an ultracentrifugation tube , followed by overlay with 6 mL of 35 % sucrose in TNE and 3 . 5 mL of 5 % sucrose in TNE . Samples were spun at 200 , 000 × g for 30 h at 4 ◦ C . Fractions were collected from the top of the gradient and analyzed using Western blotting and / or coimmunoprecipitation , as described [ 30 , 31 ] . 4 . 6 . Immunoprecipitation / Western Blot Analyses We employed a stringent RIPA formulation of 500 mM NaCl ; 10 mM Tris – HCl , pH 8 ; 0 . 1 % SDS ; 5 mM EDTA , pH 8 ; 10 × protease inhibitor ( Complete tablet , Roche ) to solubilize lipid rafts for subsequent immunoprecipitation experiments . Brieﬂy , buoyant fractions , taken from the discontinuous gradient centrifugation , were pooled and incubated with the same volume of RIPA buffer on ice for 15 min . Resulting extracts were pre - cleared by rocking with 1 mL of a 5 % slurry of RIPA equilibrated Protein A beads ( CL - 4B ; Amersham Pharmacia , Uppsala , Sweden ) for 4 h at 4 ◦ C . After removal of the precipitate , the resulting supernatant was subjected to IP / Western blot assays . The following Abs were employed : α - CD19 ( clone 6D5 , Dako ) , α - ARID3A polyclonal Ab ( produced in - house ; [ 19 ] ) , α - IgM ( BD Pharmingen ) , α - V5 ( Sigma ) , α - Raftlin ( graciously provided by Dr . Akihiko Yoshimura ; Diseases 2021 , 9 , 22 12 of 16 21 ) , α - SUMO - 1 ( Sigma ) , anti - TFII - I ( kindly provided by Dr . Carol Webb ; [ 18 ] ) , pan α - actin ( rabbit origin , Cytoskeleton , Inc . ) , α - Acid sphingomyelinase ( SMPD1 ; ab83354 , Abcam ) , goat α - EZRIN ( sc - 6407 ; Santa Cruz ) 4 . 7 . Accumulation of Cytosolic Calcium Indo - 1 AM ( acetoxymethyl ester ; Invitrogen ) was added to ~ 3 × 10 6 leukemia / lymphoma cells in 500 µ L Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution ( HBSS ; Invitrogen ) and 10 % FCS ( HBSS - 10 ) . The final Indo - 1 concentration was 1 µ M . Following incubation at 37 ◦ C for 30 min , cells were kept at RT for 5 min and then washed with HBSS containing 2 mM HEPES buffer and no serum ( HBSH - 0 ) . All manipulations including the incubation were in the dark . Cells were then reacted with a rat anti - human CD16 / CD32 Fc blocking Ab ( clone 2 . 4G2 , Pharmingen ) and washed with HBSH - 0 in the dark at 4 ◦ C . The cells were resuspended in 50 µ L HBSH - 0 , added to a total volume of 150 µ L . Prior to Ca 2 + analyses , cells were filtered at RT , warmed to 37 ◦ C , and then placed in a flow cytometer maintained at 37 ◦ C at a flow rate of 250 cells / s . Anti - IgM and anti - CD19 were added ( detailed as above in Section 4 . 4 ) 30 s prior to initiation of the experiments . Data acquisition employed a 30 s baseline and was continued for 300 s at 37 ◦ C . Cells were analyzed at ~ 250 cells / s , and their flux in calcium concentration was determined as the 485 / 405 nm emission ratio with excitation at 355 nm . Calibration was performed by measuring Rmin and Rmax , and applying the equation described previously [ 48 ] using the Acapella Kinetic Intensity Analysis script . Responses are reported as [ Ca 2 + ] vs . time . 4 . 8 . Calcium Calibration The presence of unhydrolyzed dye might affect calibration significantly . The 485 / 405 nm fluorescence ratios were converted into calcium concentrations using the analytical expression : [ Ca 2 + ] = Kd × B × ( R − Rmin ) / ( Rmax − R ) in which Rmax and Rmin are determined from the measurement . At the end of the measurement the intracellular dye was saturated with calcium . By using a Ca 2 + ionophore and saturating [ Ca 2 + ] , the Ca 2 + - insensitive AM form will not undergo a wavelength shift while the sensitive form will . 4 . 9 . Puriﬁcation of Actin To obtain detergent - soluble ( actin - free ) and insoluble ( actin - enriched ) fractions , ARID3A - transfected COS7 cells were harvested by scraping , and then resuspended in 750 µ L of pre - warmed LAS buffer ( 50 mM Pipes ( pH 6 . 9 ) , 50 mM NaCl , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM EGTA , 5 % ( v / v ) glycerol , 0 . 1 % NP - 40 , 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 ( with or without 0 . 1 % Tween 20 ) , 0 . 1 % β - mercaptoethanol , 1 mM ATP , 0 . 001 % Antifoam C , and a protease inhibitor cocktail consisting of 0 . 4 mM tosyl arginine methyl ester , 1 . 5 mM leupeptin , 1 mM pepstatin A , and 1 mM benzamidine ) . Cells were lysed by 10 passages through a 25 - gauge needle . The lysate was clarified by centrifugation ( 400 × g for 5 min at RT ) . The supernatant ( 100 µ L ) was collected , and actin polymerization was initiated by addition of 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM EGTA , 100 mM KCl , and 1 µ M phalloidin and by incubation for 1 h at 37 ◦ C . F - actin and F - actin - binding proteins were pelleted by ultracentrifugation ( 270 , 000 × g ) for 1 h at 4 ◦ C . The supernatant ( G - actin fraction ) was collected , and the pellet ( F - actin fraction ) was washed twice with Milli - Q water and resuspended in 100 µ L of 8 M urea . After addition of SDS loading buffer , the samples were separated by SDS - PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting for actin using anti - pan - actin polyclonal rabbit Ab ( 1 : 2000 ; Cell Signaling Technology , 4968 ) . 4 . 10 . Immunoﬂuorescence Staining of Murine B Cells Mouse CB7Bl / 6 MZ and FO B cells were isolated from mouse spleen cell suspension by anti - CD19 exclusion using a kit # 130 - 100 - 366 ( Miltenyi Biotec , Cologne , Germany ) . Cells were ﬂuorescently stained with rabbit αβ - actin mAb ( SP124 ; ab115777 ; Abcam ) developed with goat anti - rabbit IgG H & L ( Alexa Fluor ® 594 ) , mouse anti - ARID3A mAb A - 4 ( sc - 398367 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) developed with goat anti - mouse IgG H & L ( Alexa Fluor ® 488 ; ab150117 , Abcam ) , and stained with DAPI ( Staining Solution ab228549 , Abcam ) .

Quantiﬁcation of Blot Intensities with ImageJ Quantitative results of Western blots were assessed using ImageJ , a Java - based image analysis package downloaded from the National Institutes for Health at https : / / imagej . nih . gov / ij / download . html ( access date 21 May 2014 ) upgraded to the latest full distribution ( including macros , plugins and LUTs ) as detailed at http : / / wsr . imagej . net / distros / ( access date 23 June 2015 ) . To determine the dynamic range and limit of detection , blots were wrapped in clear plastic for 60 and 120 s . For X - ray ﬁlm exposure , blots were placed in a cassette and exposed to ﬁlm for 20 , 60 , and 300 s . The developed ﬁlm was scanned using a Molecular Image GS - 800 densitometer ( Biorad ) . Data was analyzed using the Volume Analysis Speciﬁcation Quantity in Quantity One software ( FPQuest™ ) . 4 . 12 . Modulated Polarization Microscopy ( MPM ) Modulated polarization microscopy ( MPM ) visualizes cytoskeletal ﬁlaments based on their birefringence , but differs from standard polarization microscopy by exploiting the angle dependence of birefringence . MPM imaging as detailed by Kuhn and Poenie [ 61 , 62 ] was performed at a rate of one to two processed frames per second . Each image in the resulting MPM movie sequence was enhanced slightly using a 3 × 3 convolution kernel of [ ( − 1 / 2 1 / 2 1 / 2 ) , ( − 1 1 / 2 1 / 2 ) , ( − 1 / 2 1 / 2 1 / 2 ) ] , which added a small emboss effect to the image and improved visibility . Fluorescent images were acquired using a 12 bit CCD camera ( Model DVC - 1312M , DVC , Austin , TX , USA ) on a Nikon Diaphot 200 ﬂuorescence microscope . Image stacks were obtained using a MAC 2000 z - axis focus controller ( Ludl Electronic Products , Hawthorne , NY , USA ) and a custom image acquisition plugin written for ImageJ . The point - spread function ( PSF ) was measured under similar conditions using 100 nm ﬂuorescent beads ( L - 5473 , Molecular Probes ) diluted in dH2O and dried on glass slides to give approximately one bead per ﬁeld . Image stacks were deconvolved for 500 iterations using the expectation maximization algorithm in XCOSM [ 62 ] . 3D projections were calculated using the maximum value projection method in ImageJ , and stereo pairs were generated using images that differed in rotation by 10 degrees . Images were enhanced using a multiscale 3D line ﬁlter implemented as a custom plugin for ImageJ . 4 . 13 . Puriﬁcation of ARID3A in Bacteria An N - terminal 6X - histidine - tagged ARID3A was constructed as previously described [ 63 ] . Briefly , full - length ARID3A was cloned into the pET30a + expression vector ( Novagen ) , and its expression induced with IPTG 30 min after chaperone induction . Harvested cells were disrupted by sonication , and total cell lysates were analyzed on 12 % SDS - PAGE ( prior to or as a monitor of purification ) with Silver Stain ( Invitrogen ) . Following elimination of cell debris by centrifugation , supernatants were purified by affinity chromatography over Ni 2 + - NTA agarose ( SuperFlow , ThermoScientific , Rockville , IL ) according to the manufacturer’s instruc - tions ( Novagen Inc , Madison , WI and Qiagen , Germantown , MD , USA ) . Further purification was carried out by DEAE Bio - Gel agarose chromatography as instructed by the vender ( Phar - macia Fine Chemicals , Uppsala , Sweden ) . The final yield of purified ARID3A was ~ 20 µ g from LB media .
