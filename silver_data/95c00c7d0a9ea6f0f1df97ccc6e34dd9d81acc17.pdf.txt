Endothelial cell form a major component of the BBB , but its regulation in stroke has yet to be clari ﬁ ed . We investigated the function of Yes - associated protein 1 ( YAP ) in the endothelium on BBB breakdown during cerebral ischemia / reperfusion ( I / R ) injury . The effects of YAP on BBB dysfunction were explored in middle cerebral artery occlusion / reperfusion ( MCAO / R ) - injury model mice and using brain microvascular endothelial cells ( BMEC ) exposed to oxygen - glucose deprivation / reoxygenation ( OGD / R ) injury . The degree of brain injury was estimated using staining ( 2 , 3 , 5 - Triphenyltetrazolium chloride , hematoxylin and eosin ) and the detection of cerebral blood ﬂ ow . BBB breakdown was investigated by examining the leakage of Evans Blue dye and evaluating the expression of tight junction ( TJ ) - associated proteins and matrix metallopeptidase ( MMP ) 2 and 9 . YAP expression was up - regulated in the nucleus of BMEC after cerebral I / R injury . Vertepor ﬁ n ( YAP inhibitor ) down - regulated YAP expression in the nucleus and improved BBB hyperpermeability and TJ integrity disruption stimulated by cerebral I / R . YAP - targeted small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) exerted the same effects in BMEC cells exposed to OGD / R injury . Our ﬁ ndings provide new insights into the contributions made by YAP to the maintenance of BBB integrity and highlight the potential for YAP to serve as a therapeutic target to modulate BBB integrity following ischemic stroke and related cerebrovascular diseases .

The BBB is a specialized barrier comprised of endothelial cells ( ECs ) , tight junctions ( TJs ) , pericytes , astrocytic end - feet processes , and the basement membrane . These components are crucial for the establishment of a highly regulated microenvironment , which ensures appropriate neuronal function ( Moskowitz et al . , 2010 ; Lallukka et al . , 2018 ; Sweeney et al . , 2019 ) . Therefore , protection against BBB destruction represents an effective strategy for the clinical prevention and treatment of ischemic stroke .

Front . Pharmacol . 12 : 777680 . doi : 10 . 3389 / fphar . 2021 . 777680 Frontiers in Pharmacology | www . frontiersin . org November 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 777680 1 ORIGINAL RESEARCH published : 26 November 2021 doi : 10 . 3389 / fphar . 2021 . 777680 ECs represent the most important component of the BBB , lining the entire microvasculature , and forming TJs to limit paracellular transport , ECs also display considerably a limited rate of transcellular transport for hydrophilic molecules , which contributes to the maintenance of barrier function ( Armulik et al . , 2010 ; Guclu et al . , 2014 ) . The appropriate regulation and maintenance of the barrier integrity of the ECs that line within blood vessels represent an essential feature of the BBB . The prevention of early cytoskeletal changes in microvascular ECs can attenuate BBB breakdown and secondary tissue injury , resulting in the amelioration of long - term neurological de ﬁ cits ( Fernandez - Klett et al . , 2013 ; Hall et al . , 2014 ) . However , the molecular mechanisms that underlie the regulation of EC function and the associated BBB alterations that occur under pathological conditions remain incompletely understood . The Hippo / Yes - associated protein 1 ( YAP ) kinase cascade has been reported to serve as a critical regulator of organ size , tissue regeneration , and tumor suppression ( Halder and Johnson , 2011 ; Lin et al . , 2017 ) . The Hippo pathway negatively regulates the activity of transcriptional co - activators , including YAP and transcriptional co - activator with PDZ - binding motif ( TAZ ) ( Varelas , 2014 ) . In the nucleus , YAP transcribes genes that control cell proliferation , apoptosis , and cell fate ( Szymaniak et al . , 2015 ) . YAP localization becomes dramatically altered upon tissue damage , and in some tissues , nuclear YAP abundance is associated with increased regeneration ( Choi and Kwon , 2015 ) . YAP has been shown to be involved in BBB dysfunction during ischemic stroke ( Ouyang et al . , 2020 ; Gong et al . , 2019 ) , although the function of YAP in the maintenance of the cerebral endothelial barrier ( CEB ) remains unclear . We postulated that YAP might be essential for EC protection and the maintenance of CEB integrity following ischemic stroke . In the present study , we investigated the effects of YAP on the CEB in mouse and cell models of ischemic - reperfusion injury , with the aim of determining whether YAP represents a potential therapeutic target for regulating BBB integrity after ischemic stroke and related cerebrovascular diseases . 2 MATERIALS AND METHODS 2 . 1 Ethical Approval of the Study Protocol The welfare of all animals was ensured , and all experimental procedures were performed in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals established by the National Institutes of Health . The Animal Ethics Committee of China Pharmaceutical University ( Nanjing , China ) approved all protocols [ No . SYXK ( Su ) 2018 - 0008 ] . 2 . 2 Animals Male C57BL / 6J mice were purchased from the Animal Center of Yangzhou University ( Yangzhou , China ) . Adequate food and water were provided . Animals were housed in cage in an environment maintained at a constant temperature ( 22 – 24 ° C ) with a normal circadian rhythm . 2 . 3 Cell Culture bEnd . 3 cells were purchased from Bioleaf Biotech ( Shanghai , P . R . China ) and cultured in Dulbecco ’ s modi ﬁ ed Eagle ’ s medium ( DMEM ; Gibco , Billings , MT , United States ) supplemented with 15 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ; Gibco ) , 100 U / mL penicillin and 100 U / mL streptomycin ( Ameresco , Framingham , MA , United States ) at 37 ° C in a humidi ﬁ ed atmosphere of 5 % CO 2 and 95 % air . Cells were plated onto cell culture dishes and grown to 80 – 90 % con ﬂ uence before experimentations . 2 . 4 Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion / Reperfusion Model Mice were anesthetized in an induction chamber using 3 – 4 % iso ﬂ urane in 30 % O 2 / 70 % N 2 . Anesthetization was con ﬁ rmed after approximately 2 min when respiration slowed to one breathe per second . Animals were removed from the induction chamber and placed in an anesthesia mask , which maintained an iso ﬂ urane concentration of 1 – 1 . 5 % . Middle cerebral artery occlusion / reperfusion ( MCAO / R ) was induced using a method based on intraluminal ﬁ laments with slight modi ﬁ cation as described previously ( Gong et al . , 2019 ) . Brie ﬂ y , the right middle cerebral artery of mouse was occluded by inserting a blunt - tip 4 - 0 nylon mono ﬁ lament for 1 h followed with reperfusion for 24 h . 2 . 5 Oxygen and Glucose Deprivation / Reperfusion Model bEnd . 3 cells were placed in a 37 ° C anaerobic chamber ( 0 . 2 % O 2 , 5 % CO 2 , 95 % N 2 ) and cultured in glucose - free medium for 6 h . After the oxygen - glucose deprivation , the cells were placed in glucose - containing DMEM with 15 % FBS and incubated under normoxic conditions for hours in order to imitate I / R - like conditions Cao et al . ( 2016 ) . 2 . 6 Transendothelial Electrical Resistance Assay The protective effects of vertepor ﬁ n ( VP , CAS No . 129497 - 78 - 5 ) were examined in vitro . Cells were divided into four groups ( n (cid:1) 3 ) : Control , OGD / R , VP ( 1 μ M , Supplementary Figure S1 ) treatment after 6 h OGD , and edaravone ( Edara , 1 μ M , CAS No . 89 - 25 - 8 ) . Edara is a commonly used drug for the clinical treatment of ischemic stroke and is often used as a positive drug in basic research ( Bao et al . , 2018 ) . bEnd . 3 cells were cultured on top of gelatin - coated transwell inserts in 24 - well plates for 7 days . The Transendothelial electrical resistance ( TEER ) of the EC monolayer was monitored daily using a Millicell - ERS voltohmmeter ( Millipore , United States ) . The results obtained from the experimental groups were measured after subtracting the value of a blank , cell - free ﬁ lter . 2 . 7 TTC Staining The protective effects of VP were examined in mice that were randomly divided into four groups ( n (cid:1) 6 per group ) : sham , Frontiers in Pharmacology | www . frontiersin . org November 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 777680 2 Gong et al . Inhibiting YAP Attenuates I / R Injury MCAO / R , VP ( 10 mg / kg , i . p . ) after 1 h MCAO , and Edara ( 5 mg / kg , i . p . ) . After 24 h of reperfusion , the mice brains were quickly removed and frozen at − 70 ° C . The frozen brain was coronally cut into ﬁ ve slices , then incubated individually using a 24 - well culture plate with 1 % triphenyl tetrazolium chloride ( TTC ) solution at 37 ° C for 15 min . The infarct area was measured by computerized planimetry after photographing with a digital camera . The infarct volume is calculated by summing infarct areas on each slice and multiplying by slice thickness . The personnel conducting the TTC staining was blinded to the study group assignment in order to avoid subjective factors affecting the experimental results Tsubokawa et al . ( 2017 ) . 2 . 8 Determination of Cerebral Edema and Neurological De ﬁ cits The mice were sacri ﬁ ced after MCAO / R induction . The brains were taken out and the wet weight of tissue was accurately measured . After dried in an oven at 100 ° C for 48 h , the lung tissues were weighed again , recording as dry weight . The content of water in brain were calculated to determine the degree of brain edema . The neurological de ﬁ cits of the experimental animals were graded on an 18 - point scale , as previously described Wu et al . ( 2019 ) . The evaluation indicators include body symmetry , gait , climbing , circling behavior , forelimb symmetry , compulsory circling and whisker response . The index scores are added together as the ﬁ nal score . The higher the score , the more severe the neurological de ﬁ cit . 2 . 9 Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Animal brains were removed 24 h after reperfusion , mice were euthanized , the brains excised rapidly , and dipped in 4 % paraformaldehyde . Examination was completed in the Pathology Department of the Jiangsu Center for Safety Evaluation of Drugs ( Jiangsu , P . R . China ) and the brain slices were observed by a digital scanner ( NanoZoomer 2 . 0 RS , Hamamatsu , Japan ) . 2 . 10 Cerebral Blood Flow Measurement After anesthesia with 3 % pentobarbital sodium , an incision of about 1 – 2 cm was made in the abdominal cavity of mice . Cerebral blood ﬂ ow ( CBF ) in the mesentery was measured using a laser Doppler ﬂ owmeter Laser . Images were acquired at ischemia onset and during reperfusion ( n (cid:1) 6 per group ) . 2 . 11 Evans Blue Analysis Evans Blue ( EB ) extravasation was used to determine BBB integrity as described previously Wu et al . ( 2019 ) . At 22 h after reperfusion , 2 % EB dye ( 3 ml / kg , Sigma , United States ) was injected via the tail vein . The mice were euthanized at 2 h after injection of EB and then perfused with saline . The brains were rapidly taken out and imaged . Then the right hemisphere of brain tissue was weighed , homogenized in formamide ( 0 . 1 g / ml ) and centrifuged at 5 , 000 g for 30 min after incubated at 60 ° C for 18 h . The supernatants were collected to determine the quantity of EB , the absorbance at 620 nm was measured spectrophotometrically using an In ﬁ nite M200 Pro plate reader ( Tecan , NC , United States ) . EB leakage into the brain tissue was assessed with a standard curve and expressed as micrograms per Gram of wet brain tissue . 2 . 12 In vitro Permeability Assay Cells were incubated in the Millicell ™ cell culture inserts in a humidi ﬁ ed atmosphere of 5 % CO 2 and 95 % air for 7 days . After exposure to OGD / R conditions and drugs , the medium was removed . 200 μ L of EB solution ( 0 . 67 mg evans blue powder dissolved in 4 % BSA solution ) were added into the Millicell cell culture inserts and 600 μ L of 4 % BSA solution were added into the external chamber . The cells were continuously incubated for another 1 h and then the external solution was collected and the absorbance at 620 nm was measured spectrophotometrically using an In ﬁ nite M200 Pro plate reader ( Tecan , NC , United States ) . The EB leakage of each group was calculated according to the standard curve and expressed as a percentage of the values of control group . 2 . 13 siRNA Transfection and Plasmid 2 . 13 . 1 YAP - siRNA Treatment YAP - siRNA ( sense : 5 ′ - GACAUCUUCUGGUCAGAGA - 3 ′ , and anti - sense : 3 ′ - AGUACCGGAGGUAACAGAG - 5 ′ ) were constructed by Genomeditech Co . , Ltd , ( Shanghai , China ) . Cells were divided randomly into four groups : Control , Control + siRNA , OGD / R , OGD / R + siRNA . bEnd . 3 cells were treated with YAP - siRNA or control solvent for 6 h in DEME medium and proliferated for another 24 h . OGD / R was treated subsequently in DMEM medium . After testing the expression of YAP by western blot , the cells with adequate interference ef ﬁ ciency were used in the evaluation of the downstream signaling pathways . 2 . 14 Cell Viability Culture medium containing 5 mg / ml 3 - ( 4 , 5 - Dimethylthiazol - 2 - yl ) - 2 , 5 - diphenyltetrazolium bromide ( MTT ) solution replaced the complete medium Four hours after incubation at 37 ° C , the reaction solution was removed , and 150 µL DMSO was added to each well . A microplate reader ( Epoch , Bio Tek , Winooski , VT , United States ) was used to record the absorbance with dual waves at 570 and 650 nm after 10 min of shaking . 2 . 15 Western Blot Analysis The cells or brain tissue samples ( n (cid:1) 6 , for each group ) were decapitated and rapidly collected . The prepared cells or tissues ( brain tissues from the ischemic penumbra ) were homogenized in 1 : 10 ( w / v ) ice - cold protein extraction buffer in glass homogenizers . To detect the levels of YAP and phospho - ( p ) - YAP in the nucleus , a Nuclear Extraction Kit ( Solarbio , Cat : SN0020 ) was used to isolate and purify nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions . To examine the levels of zonula occludens - 1 ( ZO - 1 ) , occludin , matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) - 2 and MMP - 9 , soluble proteins were extracted from cell lysates by centrifugation at 12 , 000 × g for 10 min at 4 ° C and collecting the supernatant .

Regarding the IF brain slice , the location of the studied brain area was showed as an illustration ﬁ gure in Supplementary Figure S1 . 2 . 17 Statistical Analysis Data are expressed as the mean ± SEM . Statistical analyses were carried out using the Student ’ s t - test ( two - tailed ) for comparison between two groups and one - way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) followed by Dunnett ’ s test if the data involved three or more groups . Tests were considered signi ﬁ cant at p < 0 . 05 . Analyses were carried out using Prism v5 . 01 ( GraphPad , San Diego , CA , United States ) . 3 RESULTS YAP is highly expressed in the nuclei of brain endothelial cells from mice subjected to MCAO / R injury in vivo . To determine the speci ﬁ c role played by YAP in ischemic stroke , YAP expression levels were evaluated in the brain after MCAO / R injury using western blotting and IF analyses . After 1 h of cerebral ischemia and 24 h of reperfusion , the expression levels of YAP and p - YAP were reduced in the cytoplasm , and the expression level of YAP was signi ﬁ cantly increased in the nucleus ( Figure 1 and Supplementary Figures S3 – 5 ) . Vertepor ﬁ n ( a small molecule inhibitor of YAP ) inhibits the expression of YAP in the nucleus under MCAO / R injury conditions . The western blot analysis results showed that VP ( 10 mg / kg ) , when i . p . injected 1 h after MCAO , signi ﬁ cantly increased the expression levels of p - YAP and YAP in the cytoplasm and decreased YAP expression levels in the nucleus ( Figure 2A ) . In addition , the IF results also showed that the ﬂ uorescence intensity of p - YAP signi ﬁ cantly increased ( Supplementary FIGURE 2 | Effects of VP treatment on YAP / p - YAP expression levels following MCAO / R injury in mice .

Inhibiting YAP Attenuates I / R Injury Fig . 7 ) , and the intensity of YAP in nucleus signi ﬁ cantly decreased after the administration of VP compared with the intensities observed in the untreated MCAO / R group ( Figure 2B and Supplementary Figure S6 ) . 3 . 1 Inhibition of YAP Attenuates MCAO / R - Induced Brain Damage VP ( 10 mg / kg ) signi ﬁ cantly reduced cerebral infarct volume , cerebral edema , and neurological de ﬁ cits after MCAO / R injury ( Figures 3A , B , Supplementary Figures S8 and 9 ) . The damaged area of the brain was reduced signi ﬁ cantly in MCAO / R model mice after the administration of VP compared with the untreated MCAO / R mice ( Figure 3C ) . CBF improved in the ischemic hemisphere of MCAO / R mice after the administration of VP compared with untreated MCAO / R mice ( Figure 3D ) . The ef ﬁ cacy of VP was similar to that observed for Edara , which was used as a positive control , which indicated that VP treatment induced improvements following ischemic brain injury in mice . 3 . 2 The Inhibition of YAP Results in the Maintenance of BBB Integrity Following MCAO / R Injury Compared with the untreated MCAO / R group , the administration of VP signi ﬁ cantly reduced EB leakage , increased the expression levels of ZO - 1 and occludin , and decreased the expression levels of matrix metallopeptidase ( MMP ) - 2 and MMP - 9 in brain tissues ( Figure 4 ) . The ef ﬁ cacy of VP was similar to Edara , which indicated that VP could improve BBB integrity following MCAO / R injury . 3 . 3 YAP is Highly Expressed in the Nucleus of Cells Exposed to OGD / R Injury In vitro To evaluate changes in YAP expression in an in vitro model of cerebral I / R injury , YAP / p - YAP expression levels were examined in the brain - derived EC line bEnd . 3 following the induction of an OGD / R model . YAP / p - YAP expression levels in the cytoplasm reduced gradually after 6 h of OGD and 6 h of reoxygenation , whereas YAP expression increased gradually in the nucleus ( Figure 5A ) . IF analysis also showed changes in YAP / p - YAP expression occurred after 6 h of OGD followed by 6 h of reoxygenation ( Figure 5B ) , which was consistent with the results of in vivo studies . 3 . 4 VP Inhibits the Expression of YAP in the Nucleus Under OGD / R Injury Conditions Whether VP can inhibit the expression of YAP in the nucleus under OGD / R injury conditions remains to be elucidated . The expression levels of the Hippo pathway target kinase YAP and p - YAP in the Hippo pathway were measured by western blotting and IF analyses in vitro after the administration of VP . The results showed that VP ( 1 µM ) signi ﬁ cantly increased the expression levels of p - YAP and YAP in the cytoplasm and decreased YAP FIGURE3 | EffectsofVPtreatmentonbraindamagecausedbyMCAO / Rinjuryinmice .

Inhibiting YAP Attenuates I / R Injury expression levels in the nucleus ( Figures 6A – C ) . Further analysis showed that under OGD / R conditions , the ratio of translocated YAP protein into the nucleus was approximately 85 % , and after VP administration , the ratio of translocated YAP into the nucleus was approximately 30 % ( Supplementary Figure S10 ) . 3 . 5 Inhibition of YAP Ameliorates the Loss of Endothelial Barrier Integrity Induced by OGD / R Injury To further investigate the protective effects of VP in vitro , bEnd . 3 cells exposed to OGD / R injury were utilized . Compared with the control group , the cell viability of the OGD / R group decreased , based on the results of an MTT assay ( Figure 7A , Supplementary Figure S11 ) . Treatment with VP ( 1 µM ) and Edara ( 1 µM ) signi ﬁ cantly increased cell survival following OGD / R injury . TEER was lower after OGD / R injury compared with the control group and increased signi ﬁ cantly following treatment with VP and Edara ( Figure 7B ) . EB leakage increased in the OGD / R group compared with that in the control group , and VP signi ﬁ cantly inhibited OGD / R - induced EB leakage to an equivalent level as observed for Edara ( Figure 7C ) . Compared with the OGD / R group , the protein expression levels of ZO - 1 and occludin were increased , and MMP − 2 and − 9 expression levels were decreased signi ﬁ cantly after VP administration ( Figures 7D , E ) .

Compared with the control group , the TEER of cells subjected to OGD / R . Treatment with YAP - siRNA induced a signi ﬁ cant increase in TEER ( Figure 8A ) . EB leakage increased in the OGD / R group compared with the control group . YAP - siRNA signi ﬁ cantly inhibited OGD / R - induced EB leakage to an equivalent level ( Figure 8B ) . Compared with the OGD / R group , the protein expressions levels of ZO - 1 and occludin increased signi ﬁ cantly after the administration of YAP - siRNA ( Figure 8C ) . The IF results also showed that the ﬂ uorescence intensity of ZO - 1 increased signi ﬁ cantly after the administration of YAP - siRNA compared with that in the OGD / R group ( Figure 8D ) . 4 DISCUSSION Here , we identi ﬁ ed a previously unrecognized role for YAP in the maintenance of endothelial TJ stability . The increased expression of YAP in the nucleus was observed in both cellular and animal models of cerebral I / R injury . The speci ﬁ c role played by YAP was investigated through the use of a YAP inhibitor and the use of YAP siRNA . The results showed YAP inhibition improved cerebral I / R injury - induced BBB dysfunction . We identi ﬁ ed YAP as a regulator of BBB integrity during pathological injury . Thus , the inhibition of YAP expression during cerebral I / R injury may represent a novel strategy for the promotion of ischemic stroke recovery . The Hippo / YAP signaling pathway plays an essential role in central nervous system development Bao et al . ( 2017 ) . YAP participates in a range of cellular functions , including migration , adhesion , phagocytosis , and signal transduction Guichet et al . ( 2018 ) . YAP regulates adherens junction dynamics and EC distribution during vascular development FIGURE 5 | Expression levels of YAP / p - YAP in brain endothelial cells following OGD / R - induced injury . bEnd . 3 cells were exposed to 6 h of OGD and 6 h of reoxygenation .

Inhibiting YAP Attenuates I / R Injury ( Dieterich et al . , 2000 ; Nagasawa - Masuda and Terai , 2017 ) . The Hippo / YAP signaling pathway has been reported to be involved in the destruction of the BBB in an in vivo model ( Gong et al . , 2019 ; Jin et al . , 2020 ) . However , no studies have investigated the function of YAP in the maintenance of CEB integrity in mice and brain EC models of ischemic stroke . In this study , we found that YAP was highly expressed in the nucleus following cerebral I / R injury model induction ( Figures 1 – 5 ) , which indicated that the Hippo / YAP signaling pathway was linked to CEB injury after ischemic stroke . We postulate that YAP acts as a key target protein , which participates in the pathological process and biologic function of ischemic stroke ; however , few studies have investigated the involvement of YAP in CEB regulation in ischemic stroke . To further explore the role played by YAP during brain injury induced by cerebral I / R , we used a YAP inhibitor , vertepor ﬁ n ( VP ) , which is a benzoporphyrin derivative that is clinically used in photodynamic therapy for neovascular macular degeneration ( Brodowska et al . , 2014 ) . Recently , studies have shown that VP inhibits YAP activation by disrupting YAP - TEA domain transcription factor ( TEAD ) interactions , which prevented YAP - induced oncogenic growth ( Liu - Chittenden et al . , 2012 ) . However , whether and how VP regulates YAP expression during the development of ischemic stroke remains unknown . In this study , VP treatment was found to signi ﬁ cantly increase the expression levels of p - YAP and YAP in the cytoplasm and decreased YAP expression levels in the nucleus under cerebral I / R model conditions ( Figures 2 – 6 ) . Furthermore , VP treatment was able to reduce the cerebral infarct volume and brain water contents and improve neurological de ﬁ cits and CBF in cerebral I / R model mice . Cerebral infarct volume , neurological de ﬁ cits , brain edema , and CBF are often used to evaluate the degree of brain injury ( Lochhead et al . , 2017 ) . H and E staining is an important method used to evaluate the degree of pathological changes in tissue sections ( Campbell et al . , 2017 ) . Our results suggested that VP ameliorated MCAO / R - induced brain damage in vivo ( Figure 3 , Supplemental Figure S8 ) . The evolution of BBB breakdown after cerebral I / R occurs along the following path : I / R rapidly induces cytoskeletal alterations in BMECs , due to the activation of a variety of FIGURE6 | Effects ofVPtreatmentonYAP / p - YAP expression levelsfollowingOGD / Rinjuryinbrainendothelial cells . bEnd . 3 cellsweretreatedwithVP ( 1 µM ) and subsequentlyexposedto6 hofOGDand6 hofreoxygenation .

Frontiers in Pharmacology | www . frontiersin . org November 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 777680 9 Gong et al . Inhibiting YAP Attenuates I / R Injury protease and signaling pathways . Cytoskeletal alterations cause EC contraction and the disassembly of TJs through junctional - accessory proteins ( for example , ZO - 1 , occludin ) . The disassembly and redistribution of TJs result in subtle BBB hyperpermeability , inducing the extravasation of ﬂ uid and small macromolecules from the blood to the central nervous system . The weakened barrier becomes more vulnerable to the MMP - 2 / 9 - mediated degradation of TJs , further damaging the BBB and permitting the eventual leakage of large macromolecules Shi et al . ( 2016 ) . In vivo , EB staining is often used to evaluate the degree of BBB damage ( Nishiyama et al . , 2008 ) . VP treatment in MCAO / R model mice was able to signi ﬁ cantly decrease EB leakage and MMP2 / 9 expression levels and increase the expression levels of ZO - 1 and occludin compared with untreated MCAO / R model mice ( Figure 4 ) . In vitro , VP remarkably alleviated OGD / R - induced endothelial - barrier injury , mitigated bEnd . 3 cell leakage , and inhibited the degradation of TJ proteins ( Figure 7 ) in OGD / R exposed cells compared with the untreated control , indicating the protective effects of VP against I / R - induced CEB damage . Meanwhile , bEnd . 3 cells transfected with YAP - siRNA were used to evaluate the effects of YAP on endothelial barrier integrity in vitro . YAP expression decreased in following siRNA interference in bEnd3 cells exposed to OGD / R ( Figure 8 ) . These results indicated that YAP - siRNA was able to maintain the integrity of the endothelial barrier by promoting the preservation of TJ , which further indicated that YAP is a vital target molecule for the maintenance of BBB integrity . Cerebral ECs are key components involved in the maintenance of BBB integrity . The loss of BBB integrity is a pathophysiological hallmark of brain diseases , including Alzheimer ’ s disease , epilepsy , and cranial trauma ( Straight et al . , 2003 ; Schmidt et al . , 2014 ; Sharma and Goyal , 2016 ) . Studies have reported that Hippo ( MST ) - YAP signaling is involved in brain vessel in various diseases , including cerebral I / R injury and subarachnoid hemorrhage , suggesting the potential for the modulation of this signaling pathway to in ﬂ uence the prognosis of many types of neurological disorders ( Gong et al . , 2019 ; Zhao et al . , 2016 ; Qu et al . , 2018 ) . Future studies remain necessary to elucidate the speci ﬁ c roles played by this pathway in the development of these FIGURE7 | EffectsofVPtreatmentonendothelialbarrierinjuriesinducedbyOGD / R . bEnd . 3cellsweretreatedwithVP ( 1 µM ) andsubsequentlyexposedto6 hof OGDand 6 hofreoxygenation .

Inhibiting YAP Attenuates I / R Injury various neurological disorders . As an essential component of this signaling pathway , YAP has been shown to be involved in several diseases , including the discord caused by viruses or bacteria ( Lee et al . , 2013 ) . Our results suggested that YAP might act as a key mediator in I / R - induced CEB injury . Our ﬁ ndings provide broad insights into brain injury characterized by BBB hyperpermeability and indicate new therapeutic strategies for severe diseases associated with dysfunctional TJ signaling . In summary , the inhibition of YAP expression in the nucleus bene ﬁ cially antagonizes the high endothelial permeability induced by cerebral I / R injury , both in vivo and in vitro . As a regulatory molecule , YAP contributes to the maintenance of CEB integrity ( Figure 9 ) . Taken together , our ﬁ ndings extend the current understanding of the regulatory mechanisms associated with TJ function and present potential novel targets for the development of ef ﬁ cacious drugs that may prevent and treat damage associated with ischemic stroke and other related diseases . In conclusion , we clari ﬁ ed a key role for YAP in BBB maintenance during stroke . YAP could represent a potential target in ECs for pharmacotherapeutic interventions designed FIGURE 8 | Effects of YAP - siRNA on endothelial barrier injury induced by OGD / R . bEnd . 3 cells were treated with YAP - siRNA and subsequently exposed to 6 h of OGD and 6 h of reoxygenation .
