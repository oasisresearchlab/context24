We conducted a systematic review of published studies on influ - enza and the following co - infections or co - morbidities that are prevalent in Africa : dengue , malaria , measles , meningococcus , Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia ( PCP ) , hemoglobin - opathies , and malnutrition . Articles were identified except for influenza and PCP . Very few studies were from Africa . Sickle cell disease , dengue , and measles co - infection were found to increase the severity of influenza disease , though this is based on few studies of dengue and measles and the measles study was of low quality . The frequency of influenza was in - creased among patients with sickle cell disease . Influenza infection increased the frequency of meningococcal disease . Studies on malaria and malnutrition found mixed results . Age - adjusted morbidity and mortality from influenza may be more common in Africa because in - fections and diseases common in the region lead to more severe outcomes and increase the influenza burden . However , gaps exist in our knowledge about these interactions . Introduction Until recently , little was known about influenza in Africa except for outbreaks reporting a high case - fatality rate [ 1 – 4 ] . In response to threats from avian and pandemic influenza , surveillance has expanded in recent years , and from 2006 – 2010 , influenza surveillance sites increased more than tenfold across the continent [ 5 ] . Recent studies have suggested that influenza is common in Africa . Much of the global burden of severe influenza is in less developed countries [ 6 ] , and PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0128580 June 11 , 2015 1 / 17 OPEN ACCESS Citation : Cohen AL , McMorrow M , Walaza S , Cohen C , Tempia S , Alexander - Scott M , et al .

Data Availability Statement : As this is a systematic review of the pubished literature , all data is available in the published literature . Funding : This work is supported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , Atlanta , Georgia , USA . Competing Interests : The authors have declared that no competing interests exist . during the 2009 influenza pandemic , Africa may have borne a disproportionate number of deaths from influenza [ 7 ] . There are a number of reasons why sub - Saharan Africa specifically may share a dispropor - tionate burden of severe disease outcomes from influenza and should be a focus of interven - tions to reduce the global burden of disease . One of these is the high prevalence of co - infections and co - morbidities that may be risk factors for more severe influenza illness , such as HIV and tuberculosis [ 8 ] . Another important co - infection may be dengue , which is under - rec - ognized and underreported in Africa ; it is estimated that as many as 1 million cases occur in Africa annually and 22 countries have reported sporadic cases or outbreaks [ 9 ] . Of the more than 600 , 000 deaths from malaria in 2012 , 90 % occurred in sub - Saharan Africa [ 10 ] . Measles is common in Africa , and N . meningitidis causes recurring meningitis epidemics in the sub - Saha - ran meningitis belt . Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia ( PCP ) is the most common opportunis - tic infection among HIV - infected individuals and may be a common cause of respiratory illness in much of sub - Saharan Africa where HIV is prevalent [ 11 ] . In 2010 , more than 230 , 000 infants were estimated to be born with sickle cell disease in sub - Saharan Africa , and more than 3 . 6 million infants were born with sickle cell trait , more than two - thirds of the global burden of disease [ 12 ] . The World Health Organization estimates that malnutrition contributes to a third of all deaths in children under five years , and many of these deaths are in sub - Saharan Africa [ 13 ] . Little is known about whether co - infections and co - morbidities which are prevalent in Af - rica have the potential to increase the frequency or severity of influenza infection or to affect re - sponse to influenza vaccination . Co - infection of influenza with HIV , tuberculosis , and pneumococcus has been established as causes of severe disease in Africa and have been ex - plored recently in the literature [ 14 – 18 ] . The impact of underlying medical conditions such as diabetes mellitus and asthma on influenza has been explored extensively in the global literature [ 19 ] . We conducted a systematic review of published studies to fill the gaps in knowledge of other co - infections and co - morbidities that could also plausibly influence influenza burden in Africa . Materials and Methods We conducted systematic reviews of the literature published from January 1900 to August 2013 . Seven databases were searched : Medline [ Ovid ] , Embase , PsycINFO , CINAHL , Web of Science , Cochrane , Global Health , Google Scholar , and CAB Abstracts . Studies were included if they contained original data on the following : 1 . Frequency or burden of influenza and co - infection or co - morbidity 2 . Disease association between influenza and co - infection or co - morbidity 3 . Clinical presentation of influenza and co - infection or co - morbidity 4 . Effectiveness of interventions preventing laboratory - confirmed influenza among individuals with the co - infection or co - morbidity Eligible studies had to be conducted in humans and could be of any study design except case studies . Summary measures gathered as part of the review differed by study design ; when avail - able , relative risks , odds ratios ( OR ) , and percents of seroconversion or seroprotection after in - fluenza vaccination were abstracted . Studies could be conducted in any country or setting but needed to be written in English , Spanish , French , Portuguese , Italian , or German . Databases were last searched in September 2013 . The titles of all studies identified through the database searches were reviewed by two reviewers ; the abstracts and full text of potentially Review of Influenza Co - Infection in Africa PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0128580 June 11 , 2015 2 / 17 relevant articles were then reviewed . Additional articles were identified from reviewing bibliog - raphies of published articles . Seven separate systematic reviews were conducted and reported according to PRISMA Statement guidelines [ 20 ] . The topics of the reviews were chosen among infections and mor - bidities with the following two characteristics : ( 1 ) they are prevalent or emerging infections or underlying medical conditions in African countries , and ( 2 ) an association with influenza is plausible but not well - accepted or recently reviewed in the literature . The topics of the reviews included in this paper were not intended to be comprehensive nor specific to Africa ; they were chosen to fill in research gaps for conditions for which little is known and which might impact influenza in Africa . The seven infections and morbidities in this review were dengue , malaria , measles , meningococcal disease , PCP , hemoglobinopathies , and malnutrition . For each search , we included ( 1 ) a term for influenza ( “ influenza ” or “ flu ” ) and ( 2 ) a term for each co - infection or co - morbidity , as listed below . Variations on words were also included , e . g . , “ parasite ” and “ parasitology , ” depending on the database . The search strategy differed slightly depending on the database . Search terms for co - infections and co - morbidities included in this review were as follows : 1 . Malaria : malaria , Plasmodium or parasite 2 . Malnutrition : Malnutrition , kwashiorkor , marasmus , or nutrition 3 . Hemoglobinopathies : Hemoglobinopathy , sickle cell , hemoglobin SC , hemoglobin C , or thalassemia 4 . Meningococcal Disease : Neisseria meningitides or meningococcus 5 . Dengue : Dengue 6 . Measles : Measles 7 . Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia : Pneumocystis Several studies were identified that assessed probiotics or other nutritional supplements not traditionally found in resource - limited settings ; therefore , we restricted inclusion criteria for these malnutrition articles to nutritional supplements that are commonly available in African settings such as zinc sulfate or Vitamin A . When appropriate , we rated the quality of the indi - vidual studies using the Newcastle - Ottawa Scale [ 21 ] . Studies were considered high quality if the Newcastle - Ottawa Scale was (cid:1) 7 out of 9 ; studies were of low quality if the score was (cid:3) 3 of 9 . Individual studies were also assessed for potential bias or confounding . No review protocol was registered . Human subjects review was not necessary since this was a systematic review of published studies . Results Co - infections Dengue . Our literature search yielded 1 , 228 articles of which 287 were duplicates ( Fig 1 ) . Of the remaining 941 articles , 12 were deemed to be potentially relevant and were fully assessed for eligibility and 2 met selection criteria , both from Nicaragua . Both studies were large cohort studies of high quality ( S1 Table ) . The 2009 pandemic influenza A ( H1N1 ) pdm09 ( pH1N1 ) co - incided with the dengue season in Nicaragua , and both studies found that co - infection was as - sociated with increased illness severity . The first study followed a cohort of children for influenza A ( pH1N1 ) infection . Of 185 children with influenza A ( pH1N1 ) infection , 3 were co - infected with dengue . All three ( 100 % ) of co - infected children were hospitalized , compared Review of Influenza Co - Infection in Africa PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0128580 June 11 , 2015 3 / 17 with 1 % of those with influenza A ( pH1N1 ) infection only ( p < 0 . 001 ) and 42 % of those with dengue infection only ( p = 0 . 08 ) [ 22 ] . The second study followed a cohort of children with den - gue and found that 66 % had antibodies to influenza A ( pH1N1 ) , suggesting recent infection with influenza . Dengue patients with serologic evidence of recent past influenza A ( pH1N1 ) in - fection had nearly twofold increased odds of developing shock compared with dengue patients without evidence of recent influenza A ( pH1N1 ) infection [ OR = 1 . 93 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 1 . 01 – 3 . 31 , p = 0 . 045 ] [ 23 ] . Malaria . Titles and abstracts of 3 , 461 published articles were reviewed ( Fig 1 ) . Of these ar - ticles , 669 were duplicates and were removed . The remaining 2 , 670 titles and abstracts were as - sessed and 4 articles met the inclusion criteria for this review . All 4 studies assessing malaria Fig 1 .

Malaria infection was diagnosed by blood smear in all studies . Three of the four studies were of high quality , and all included at least 25 cases ( S1 Table ) . The first three studies evaluated the risk of co - infection , but not the impact on disease sever - ity . The earliest of these studies , which was from Tanzania and had the lowest quality , used se - rology to confirm influenza infection in 14 of 24 subjects , which was a subset of 128 subjects clinically diagnosed with influenza [ 24 ] . Among children aged 0 – 9 years , 28 ( 62 % ) of 45 with influenza also had malaria parasitemia . Among age - and village - matched asymptomatic con - trol children , 38 ( 84 % ) of 45 had parasitemia , which was a significantly higher parasitemia ( p = 0 . 02 ) and a mean positive parasite density than influenza cases ( p = 0 . 01 ) . No statistically significant differences were identified in older age groups . The remaining studies all used re - verse transcription polymerase chain reaction to identify influenza infections . A study of chil - dren aged 5 – 10 years in Kenya found that 4 ( 11 % ) of 36 subjects with influenza infection were co - infected with malaria [ 25 ] . Likewise , influenza infection occurred in 4 ( 13 % ) of 31 children with malaria vs 32 ( 40 % ) of 81 children without malaria infection ( p = 0 . 04 ) . A study in Senegal found that among 82 episodes of acute respiratory infection in 67 children , 1 ( 4 % ) of 25 with influenza had a malaria co - infection , while 6 ( 18 % ) of 34 children with no respiratory virus identified had malaria ( p = 0 . 11 ) [ 26 ] . Another study in Kenya found 45 % ( 149 / 331 ) of influen - za - positive patients were co - infected with malaria , whereas only 6 % ( 149 / 2408 ) of malaria - pos - itive patients were co - infected with influenza [ 27 ] . Children hospitalized for respiratory disease and with influenza infection were less likely than those without influenza to have malaria ( risk ratio [ RR ] , 0 . 57 – 0 . 76 across sites and ages ) , and children with malaria infection were less likely than those without to have influenza ( RR , 0 . 36 – 0 . 63 ) ; these findings may be because febrile children are likely to have influenza or malaria infection , but not necessarily co - infection with both . The authors also evaluated the severity of co - infection in this study . Among co - infected children aged 24 – 59 months , hospital length of stay was 2 . 7 and 2 . 8 days longer than influen - za - only - infected children at the 2 sites , and 1 . 3 and 3 . 1 days longer than those with malaria only ( all p < 0 . 01 ) . Measles . Our literature search yielded 3 , 902 articles ( Fig 1 ) . Of these , 483 were duplicates , leaving 3 , 429 articles . The full text of two was reviewed , and one met selection criteria , which was of low quality ( S1 Table ) . This study from Italy in the 1960 ’ s tested 68 patients with mea - sles for influenza co - infection , as well as other respiratory pathogens . Complications such as pneumonia or enteritis were found in 60 % ( 9 / 15 ) of patients with measles and influenza A , 63 % ( 5 / 8 ) of patients with measles and influenza B , but only 17 % ( 5 / 30 ) of patients with mea - sles and no identified respiratory viral co - infection ( p = 0 . 03 for patients with measles and any influenza compared with measles and no viral co - infection ) [ 28 ] . Meningococcus . Our literature search yielded 2 , 419 articles , of which 156 were duplicates ( Fig 1 ) . This yielded 2 , 263 articles ; the full text of 42 were screened for eligibility , and 18 met se - lection criteria . Of these , half ( 9 ) were of high quality and three were of low quality ( S1 Table ) . Six used an ecological cohort study design , though none of those were of low quality . The association between invasive meningococcal disease and antecedent viral infection was noted as long ago as World War I [ 29 ] , though the patients in these early reports were not uni - formly tested for influenza and meningococcus and a definitive association was not found . More recent studies from a variety of settings have observed a temporal association between in - fluenza and meningococcal meningitis outbreaks : influenza B in India [ 30 ] , influenza A and B in Germany [ 31 ] , and influenza A in the United Kingdom [ 32 ] . Temporal associations have been confirmed by testing patients with meningococcal disease for serologic evidence of recent influenza infection . During concurrent outbreaks of influenza and meningococcal disease at a mental hospital in the U . S . in 1968 , patients with meningococcal disease serogroup B were Review of Influenza Co - Infection in Africa PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0128580 June 11 , 2015 5 / 17 more likely to have a fourfold or greater rise in antibody titers to influenza A than controls [ 33 ] . Similarly , patients with meningococcal disease in England and Wales in 1989 were nearly four times more likely than age - matched controls to have serologic evidence of recent influenza A infection as measured by high antibody titers ( OR 3 . 9 , 95 % CI 1 . 2 – 13 . 9 ) [ 34 ] . Two more re - cent outbreaks also confirmed an association in settings where close contact likely perpetuated transmission : a cluster of 5 matching , nongroupable meningitis cases in children who all rode the same school bus in the U . S . had increased risk of serologic evidence of influenza B infection as measured by high titers [ 35 ] , and an outbreak of 9 cases of meningococcal serogroup C in - fections among Greek Air Force recruits had evidence of influenza B infection , either by a four - fold increase in antibody titers of acute and convalescent serum samples or a permanent high antibody titer of (cid:1) 1 : 64 in both serum samples [ 36 ] . Some studies have looked for evidence of any viral respiratory infection among patients with meningococcal disease outside the setting of acute outbreaks . One study found an associa - tion between a four - fold rise in influenza B titers and bacterial meningitis among children ad - mitted to a hospital in the U . S . ; however , this association was not specific for bacterial meningitis caused by N . meningitidis [ 37 ] . A similar association has been identified among stu - dents at an Air Force base in the U . S . who had meningococcal serogroup C or Y disease [ 38 ] . More recently , a number of studies have quantified the magnitude of the ecologic associa - tions between the timing of influenza and meningococcal epidemics in a number of settings through modelling of surveillance data from many years ( Table 1 ) . Although there has been one study that found no ecologic association between influenza and meningococcal disease [ 39 ] , the majority of these studies found a statistically significant association [ 40 – 45 ] . One study found an association only among infants less than 1 year of age [ 40 ] and another only with meningococcal disease serogroup B [ 44 ] . Studies from Canada and Germany have found an association between influenza A and invasive meningococcal disease that was strongest with a 1 - week lag between influenza and meningococcal disease [ 42 , 43 ] . In summary , there is evidence from a number of observational studies , many of high quality , that meningococcal disease increases in frequency following influenza . Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia ( PCP ) . Our literature search yielded 433 articles ; 66 duplicates were removed , leaving 366 articles , of which none met selection criteria ( Fig 1 ) . Co - morbidity host factors Hemoglobinopathies . The literature review identified 327 potentially relevant articles , of which 41 were removed as duplicates ( Fig 1 ) . We reviewed the titles and abstracts of the re - maining 286 manuscripts , and assessed the full text of 40 articles for eligbility , of which 19 met selection criteria . None were from the African region , and all studied sickle cell disease except one . Six studies were immunogenicity studies so the Newcastle - Ottawa Score was not applica - ble . Of the remaining studies , 7 were of high quality , 1 was of good quality , and 5 were of low quality . Four published case series of influenza infection among patients with sickle cell disease showed that influenza can precipitate acute chest syndrome among individuals with sickle cell disease [ 46 – 49 ] and that influenza A ( pH1N1 ) may have caused more severe outcomes than seasonal influenza when it was first identified [ 46 ] . A case series of 75 children hospitalized with influenza A ( pH1N1 ) in Milwaukee , Wisconsin , USA , found 16 % had a hemoglobinopathy [ 50 ] . In 2009 , an outbreak of influenza A ( pH1N1 ) occurred at a camp in the U . S . for children with hematologic and oncologic conditions ; although there was no comparison group , children with sickle cell disease were disproportionately ( 82 % ) affected by influenza , and most ( 89 % ) were hospitalized [ 51 ] . A study from Brazil found that sickle cell disease was not associated Review of Influenza Co - Infection in Africa PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0128580 June 11 , 2015 6 / 17 with death among patients infected with influenza A ( pH1N1 ) [ 52 ] . A study from Spain found that 3 % of children seen in an emergency department with influenza A ( pH1N1 ) had a hemo - globinopathy or underlying blood disorder , and that those conditions were associated with a nearly six - fold increased odds of admission [ 53 ] . The largest and most rigorous study of the burden of influenza among individuals with sickle cell disease used administrative data from four U . S . states and found that children with sickle cell disease were hospitalized with influenza at 56 times the rate of children without sickle cell disease [ 54 ] . Patients with hemoglobinopathies have impaired immune responses , and individuals with sickle cell anemia may develop respiratory complications such as acute chest syndrome in re - sponse to influenza infection . Six studies evaluated whether influenza vaccine is immunogenic among individuals with sickle cell disease ( Table 2 ) . Five studies found that influenza vaccine was immunogenic among children and adults with seroconversion rates of 60 – 87 % and Table 1 .

One study in adults with sickle cell disease found impaired immune responses to trivalent inactivated vaccine , suggesting that the long - term effects of sickle cell disease , such as splenic atrophy , may affect immune response to vaccination [ 60 ] . Influenza vaccines are generally considered safe among individuals with sickle cell disease ; however , one study suggested a 7 - to 9 - fold increased risk of hospitalization for sickle cell anemia after administration of trivalent inactivated vaccine [ 61 ] . Follow - up studies by the same group did not find increased hospitali - zations for sickle cell crises in adults [ 62 ] or children [ 63 ] after influenza vaccination . No vac - cine effectiveness or efficacy studies among persons with sickle cell disease have been conducted . We found only one article that evaluated the interaction between influenza vaccine and thal - assemia . This study found that the 2009 influenza A ( pH1N1 ) MF59 - adjuvanted vaccine was immunogenic and safe among adolescents and young adults with β - thalassemia [ 64 ] . In summary , a number of high quality observational studies showed that sickle cell disease is associated with increased severity and frequency of influenza .

Among the 16 articles that met the inclusion criteria for this review , 5 assessed the impact of malnutrition in children on influ - enza disease and 11 assessed malnutrition as a risk factor for poor response to influenza vacci - nation in the elderly . Two studies were randomized trials , so the Newcastle - Ottawa Score was not applicable . Of the remaining studies , eight studies were of high quality and none were low quality ( S1 Table ) . A number of studies have shown that protein - energy or micronutrient malnutrition may modify the clinical course of influenza infection in children . Two studies assessed malnutrition during the influenza A ( pH1N1 ) pandemic period . A study of hospitalized children in Argen - tina found that malnutrition was a risk factor for death among children with influenza A ( pH1N1 ) infection [ RR = 3 . 07 ( 1 . 46 – 6 . 48 ) ] [ 65 ] . A second study of 74 children hospitalized with influenza A ( pH1N1 ) in Peru found that malnutrition was common ( 40 % ) but was not as - sociated with severe disease [ OR = 1 . 7 ( 0 . 4 – 7 . 2 ) ] ; in this study , the type of malnutrition was not specified [ 66 ] . A third study among Gambian children that found few cases of influenza among malnourished children presenting to care at an outpatient clinic ( (cid:3) 5 % prevalence ) and no statistically significant difference in the prevalence of influenza between malnourished and nourished children [ 67 ] . A randomized trial of vitamin D supplementation in Japanese chil - dren receiving 1200 IU Vitamin D3 daily found a reduced risk of influenza A infection ( RR = 0 . 58 , 95 % CI 0 . 34 – 0 . 99 ) [ 68 ] .

S . study that examined the impact of body mass index ( BMI ) on influenza A ( pH1N1 ) found that among children 2 – 19 years of age hospitaliza - tion was associated with being underweight ( BMI (cid:3) 5 th percentile ) among those with [ OR = 12 . 5 , ( 3 . 4 – 45 . 5 ) ] or without [ OR = 5 . 5 , ( 1 . 3 – 22 . 5 ) ] chronic conditions [ 69 ] . Among the elderly there were 11 studies that assessed malnutrition and nutritional supple - mentation as a risk factor for poor immunogenic response to vaccination , as measured by hu - moral immunity . Four articles assessed the relationship between general nutritional status and BMI and response to influenza vaccine [ 70 – 73 ] , but only 1 study found an association between poor vaccine response and low BMI [ 73 ] . Other studies found statistically significant associa - tions between markers of nutritional status including haemoglobin [ 71 ] , iron [ 71 ] , total protein [ 71 ] , serum albumin [ 74 ] , vitamin D [ 75 ] , and vitamin E [ 76 ] and poor response to influenza vaccination . Other studies found no association between protein [ 77 ] , beta - carotene [ 78 ] , reti - nol [ 78 ] , alpha - tocopherol [ 78 ] or zinc [ 78 ] and response to influenza vaccination . Likewise , two studies of zinc supplementation in the elderly found conflicting results [ 79 , 80 ] . One study found that neither zinc nor zinc plus arginine affected response to influenza immunization in the elderly [ 79 ] , while the other found that supplementation with zinc sulphate and selenium sulfide increased seroprotection rates to influenza A ( H3N2 ) [ 80 ] . In summary , there were a number of good or high quality studies , but the results were mixed regarding whether there was an association between influenza and malnutrition . Discussion This systematic review suggests that infections and diseases more prevalent in settings such as Africa may affect the frequency and severity of influenza infection ( Table 3 ) . Studies included in this review suggest an association between influenza severity or frequency and sickle cell dis - ease , dengue , and measles , though the data on the potential interaction between influenza and dengue and measles are based few studes and the study of measles is of low quality . Influenza infection increased the frequency of meningococcal disease . The studies on malaria and malnu - trition found mixed results with respect to association with influenza frequency and severity . Other infections not included in these systematic reviews , such as HIV , tuberculosis , and Review of Influenza Co - Infection in Africa PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0128580 June 11 , 2015 9 / 17 pneumococcal disease , are associated with increased severity of influenza . We found no data on influenza and PCP . Many of the studies were not of high quality . More high quality studies should be conducted in lower income settings and African countries to confirm these associa - tions . Although influenza has long been under - recognized as a cause of illness and death in Af - rica , this review suggests that prevention and vaccination against influenza can prevent severe influenza infection in these high - risk and co - infected groups . Although HIV was not included in this review , it is epidemic in many sub - Saharan countries [ 81 ] , and recent reviews found that HIV and AIDS are associated with increased severity of in - fluenza [ 14 , 82 ] . In adults in the U . S . , HIV is associated with increased severity [ 83 ] and mor - tality [ 84 ] among patients with influenza . HIV - infected adults in Kenya have been found to have increased odds of hospitalization for pneumonia [ 85 ] . HIV - infected children in South Af - rica have an increased risk of hospitalization for pneumonia [ 86 , 87 ] . In South Africa , HIV confers increased odds of death from influenza - associated pneumonia in all ages [ 8 , 88 ] , and the HIV epidemic drives the epidemiology and clinical presentation of influenza [ 8 , 89 ] . Influenza can be a risk factor for other infections . As has been shown with pneumococcal disease [ 15 , 16 ] , influenza appears to increase an individual ’ s susceptibility to meningococcal disease . Similarly , tuberculosis is epidemic in many sub - Saharan countries [ 81 ] , and influenza may be associated with an increased risk of death from tuberculosis [ 90 , 91 ] . Mortality data from the 1918 influenza pandemic and more recent data from South Africa suggest that death from tuberculosis may be precipitated by co - infection with influenza [ 17 , 91 ] . Social and environmental factors may increase the risk of severe influenza in settings like Africa . As classified by World Bank , all of sub - Saharan African countries are low - or middle - income countries [ 92 ] , and lower socioeconomic status is associated with increased severity and burden of influenza disease [ 93 – 95 ] .

Low birth weight and non - exclusive breast feeding are common in sub - Saharan Africa [ 81 ] . Solid fuel use is common in sub - Saharan Africa and leads to exposure to indoor air pollution . Low birth weight , non - exclu - sive breast feeding and exposure to indoor air pollution are associated with pneumonia , if not with influenza specifically [ 96 – 98 ] . Some infectious diseases common in Africa may make the diagnosis of influenza challeng - ing because of similar clinical presentations . Malaria and dengue can present clinically with fe - brile syndromes similar to influenza [ 99 ] , and co - infection has been reported [ 100 – 104 ] . Although measles and PCP are common in Africa , can present as febrile respiratory illness , and may be associated with changes in the immune system , we found too few published articles to comment on the interaction of those infections with influenza . If there is an association be - tween PCP and influenza infection , it may be difficult to tease out the effects of underlying HIV infection since the majority of patients with PCP will also have HIV infection . The main limitation of these reviews are the paucity of high quality published articles in some areas — namely dengue , measles , and PCP — which limit the conclusions that can be drawn . Nearly all of the studies use an observational study design , including ecological cohort studies of influenza and meningococcus . Although many of these observational studies were of high quality , and randomized controlled trials would not be ethical or feasible to answer many of these research questions , observational studies are subject to biases . Except for the publica - tions on malaria , most of the published articles are from countries not in Africa , so the findings may not be generalizable to low - income and African settings . For example , only one study eval - uating the association between meningococcal disease and respiratory viruses has been con - ducted in Africa ; although there was a statistically significant association found , the viruses evaluated ( adenovirus , parainfluenza , respiratory syncytial virus , and rhinovirus ) did not in - clude influenza [ 105 ] . This is also not a comprehensive review of every condition that might impact influenza in Africa . Some of the articles may use less effective laboratory techniques to identify influenza , particularly older studies that were conducted before more sensitive and specific techniques , such as polymerase chain reaction for influenza , were developed or com - monly used ; this may misclassify some patients with influenza as not having influenza . Studies used differing definitions of immune response , either high titers or a four - fold response , which may make it difficult to interpret and determine active co - infection . Lastly , many of the studies did not control for potential confounding factors such as other infections ( e . g . , HIV ) , severity at presentation , and health care access and did not include comparison groups to adequately address the research question . Vaccination against influenza remains the most important and effective way to prevent dis - ease from influenza . Very little influenza vaccine is available and used in sub - Saharan Africa [ 106 ] . Vaccinating populations at high risk of severe complications , such as individuals with HIV infection , tuberculosis , and sickle cell disease , should be prioritized in countries where those conditions are prevalent . Although there are few studies demonstrating the efficacy or ef - fectiveness of influenza vaccine among individuals who are infected with tuberculosis , influen - za vaccine is safe and effective among adults that are infected with HIV [ 107 ] and those that have sickle cell disease [ 55 – 59 ] . Since influenza can predispose individuals to pneumococcal and meningococcal disease , vaccination against those pathogens may reduce the burden of these secondary bacterial infections and be important in minimizing disease seasonally [ 108 ] and during a pandemic [ 109 ] . Prevention and treatment of other diseases such as HIV with an - tiretrovirals will also be an essential component to controlling influenza in settings with high HIV prevalence . Micronutrient supplementation may also be useful , particularly in settings with malnutrition , although micronutrient interventions would be unlikely to be implemented for influenza only .
