Previous methods for this task mainly rely on inference optimiza - tion or generative adversarial network , but they are either very time - consuming or struggling at fine control of the foreground objects ( e . g . , texture and content details ) . To address these issues , we pro - pose a novel Painterly Harmonization stable Diffusion model ( PHD - iffusion ) , which includes a lightweight adaptive encoder and a Dual Encoder Fusion ( DEF ) module . Specifically , the adaptive encoder and the DEF module first stylize foreground features within each en - coder . Then , the stylized foreground features from both encoders are combined to guide the harmonization process . During training , be - sides the noise loss in diffusion model , we additionally employ con - tent loss and two style losses , i . e . , AdaIN style loss and contrastive style loss , aiming to balance the trade - off between style migration and content preservation . Compared with the state - of - the - art mod - els from related fields , our PHDiffusion can stylize the foreground more sufficiently and simultaneously retain finer content .

While standard image harmonization [ 7 , 8 ] focuses on adapting low - level statistics ( e . g . , color , brightness ) , painterly im - age harmonization [ 3 , 44 , 58 ] is more challenging as it requires transferring high - level styles in addition to low - level statistics . Existing works for this task can be roughly divided into two categories : optimization - based [ 36 , 58 ] and feed - forward [ 3 , 44 , 56 ] approaches . For the optimization - based approaches [ 36 , 58 ] , they optimize over the composite image by minimizing the designed losses , which makes them very time - consuming and unsuitable for real - time applications . Besides , the feed - forward [ 3 , 44 , 56 ] meth - ods mainly rely on Generative Adversarial Network ( GAN ) [ 15 ] and the trained model can directly generate the harmonized im - ages . However , one limitation of GAN - based approaches is limited control over complex foregrounds [ 49 ] , resulting in unsatisfactory harmonized foregrounds ( e . g . , loss of content and style details ) . In recent years , diffusion models [ 21 ] have demonstrated compa - rable or better performance compared with state - of - the - art image generation models , by formulating image generation as sequential stochastic transitions from a simple distribution to data distribu - tion . Diffusion methods can be divided into unconditional diffusion methods [ 21 , 51 ] and conditional diffusion methods [ 39 , 46 ] . The a r X i v : 2308 . 02228v1 [ c s . C V ] 4 A ug 2023 MM ’23 , October 29 - November 3 , 2023 , Ottawa , ON , Canada Lingxiao Lu , Jiangtong Li , Junyan Cao , Li Niu , and Liqing Zhang unconditional diffusion methods aim to generate realistic images by modeling the distribution of natural images without conditioning on any specific input . Whereas , the conditional diffusion methods aim to generate images with the guidance of conditional informa - tion ( e . g . , text , semantic mask , etc . ) . Among them , Stable Diffusion ( SD ) [ 46 ] is one of the most popular models , which successfully integrates the text CLIP [ 45 ] into latent diffusion . Further , some more recent models ( e . g . , T2I - adapter [ 39 ] , ControlNet [ 57 ] ) freeze the SD model and introduce trainable adapters to encode different types of conditions into SD through multi - step guidance . There - fore , conditional diffusion models offer a promising and flexible approach to improve painterly image harmonization by enabling multi - step guidance for the photographic foreground . Several existing works have introduced diffusion methods into similar tasks like cross - domain image composition [ 18 ] and image editing [ 38 ] . For example , CDC [ 18 ] proposed an inference - time conditioning method that uses high - frequency details from the background and low - frequency style from the foreground object for image composition . However , CDC [ 18 ] assumes that high - frequency ( resp . , low - frequency ) feature in the image represents style ( resp . , content ) information , which does not always hold . An - other work SDEdit [ 38 ] synthesizes images by first adding noise to the input image and then iteratively denoising through a stochastic differential equation . However , this approach lacks proper and suf - ficient guidance during the denoising process , leading to the final image lacking sufficient styles and contents . In this paper , we introduce Painterly Harmonization stable Diffu - sion model ( PHDiffusion ) , which exploits two extra modules based on the Stable Diffusion ( SD ) model . Inspired by the conditional dif - fusion model [ 39 ] , we equip SD with a lightweight adaptive encoder , which aims to extract the required condition information ( i . e . , back - ground style , image content ) from the composite image . As part of denoising U - Net , the denoising encoder in SD takes composite image as input . The adaptive encoder takes in the concatenation of composite image and foreground mask , producing residuals added to the feature maps in the denoising encoder . Based on the denois - ing encoder and the adaptive encoder , we introduce a Dual Encoder Fusion ( DEF ) module to fuse the information from two encoders . Specifically , given the image features extracted by two encoders , our DEF module incorporates the background style into foreground content and generates the stylized foreground features . Then , the stylized foreground features from two encoders are combined to provide multi - step guidance in the denoising steps . To utilize the rich prior knowledge in pretrained SD and relieve the training burden , following [ 39 ] , we freeze the model parameters of SD , and only update the adaptive encoder and DEF module during training . The standard noise loss used in diffusion models [ 46 ] could maintain the image content , but cannot migrate background style to the foreground . Therefore , we further introduce two additional style losses , i . e . , AdaIN loss and contrastive style loss , to balance the style and content for foreground object . The AdaIN loss [ 22 ] aligns the multi - scale statistics ( e . g . , mean , variance ) of the foreground object with the background painting , while the contrastive style loss [ 5 ] aims to push the foreground style towards background style . In addition , we also incorporate a content loss to address the issue of excessive content preservation by using noise loss alone . With noise loss , style losses , and content loss , our PHDiffusion is able to comprehend the background style and preserve the foreground content . During testing , our PHDiffusion could be directly used to produce harmonized image , preventing additional time - consuming inference optimization [ 18 , 26 ] . To verify the effectiveness of our PHDiffusion , we compare our methods with the state - of - the - art methods , and conduct experi - ments on the benchmark datasets COCO [ 32 ] and WikiArt [ 41 ] . The experimental results show that our PHDiffusion can achieve certain visually pleasant results that previous methods can - not achieve , especially when the background has dense tex - tures or abstract style . Our contributions can be summarized as follows : 1 ) We are the first work focusing on painterly image harmonization using diffusion model . 2 ) We propose a Painterly Harmonization stable Diffusion model ( PHDiffusion ) by using dual encoder fusion to provide effective guidance and reasonable loss designs to achieve sufficient stylization . 3 ) The experimental results show that our PHDiffusion strikes a good balance between adapting styles and maintaining structures . 2 RELATED WORK 2 . 1 Image Harmonization As a subtask of image composition [ 42 ] , image harmonization aims to adjust the color and illumination statistics of foreground to be compatible with background in a composite image . In recent years , deep learning methods [ 4 , 6 , 17 , 54 , 62 ] play an important role in this field . Especially after the first large - scale image harmonization dataset iHarmony4 [ 8 ] was released , supervised image harmoniza - tion [ 2 , 9 , 16 , 19 , 20 , 33 ] methods have received more and more attention . For example , DoveNet [ 8 ] approached image harmoniza - tion as a domain translation task . Hao et al . [ 20 ] utilized attention block to calculate non - local information for foreground adjustment . SSAM [ 9 ] focused on relation between the spliced region and non - spliced region by exploiting a dual path attention model to fuse them together . CDTNet [ 7 ] combined pixel - to - pixel transforma - tion and RGB - to - RGB transformation for high - resolution image harmonization . Recently , DCCF [ 55 ] and 𝑆 2 𝐶𝑅𝑁𝑒𝑡 [ 31 ] are applied in this field for high resolution image harmonization . Note that the abovementioned methods require ground - truth image to supervise , which is not suitable for our task . 2 . 2 Painterly Image Harmonization As a similar task to image harmonization , painterly image harmo - nization aims to blend a photographic foreground into an artistic background painting , resulting in a visually coherent painting . Com - pared with image harmonization , painterly image harmonization is more challenging as it needs to adapt high - level styles beyond low - level statistics . Deep Painterly Harmonization [ 36 ] introduced a two - pass algorithm to ensure both spatial and inter - scale statis - tical consistency . Meanwhile , Deep Image Blending [ 58 ] utilized a two - stage blending algorithm and proposed a Poisson blending loss to guide blending together with content and style loss . How - ever , both Deep Painterly Harmonization [ 36 ] and Deep Image Blending [ 58 ] are optimization - based method , which optimizes the input image during inference , making them unusable from real - time harmonization . On the other hand , E2STN [ 44 ] , PHDNet [ 3 ] , and Yan et al . [ 56 ] exploited the feed - forward scheme by first training Painterly Image Harmonization using Diffusion Model MM ’23 , October 29 - November 3 , 2023 , Ottawa , ON , Canada the generator and then directly producing the harmonized image during inference . Specifically , E2STN [ 44 ] took advantages of both global and local discriminators to harmonize the embedded ele - ment with the background image . PHDNet [ 3 ] exploited spatial and frequency domains to capture different types of background type , and then adjusted the foreground in both domains . Yan et al . [ 56 ] integrated GP - GAN [ 53 ] , WCT [ 29 ] , and StyleTr 2 [ 10 ] to - gether to fuse the global and local information together . Note that , these feed - forward approaches [ 3 , 44 , 56 ] are mainly based on ad - versarial learning by playing a minimax game between generator and discriminator , which have limited control over complex pho - tographic foreground [ 49 ] and have difficulty in leveraging prior knowledge across different image domains [ 15 ] . Different from them , our method is built upon the diffusion model , with stylized foreground features as guidance and a combo of style losses to produce the harmonized result . 2 . 3 Artistic Style Transfer Artistic style transfer aims to stylize a content image given a style image . Previous optimization - based methods [ 13 , 14 , 25 ] optimize the content image to match its style with the style image . In con - trast , feed - forward [ 10 , 22 , 24 , 28 , 35 , 43 ] methods generate stylized images by training a generator to combine the content image and the style image . For example , style - relevant statistics [ 30 , 60 ] ( e . g . , mean and standard deviation of feature map ) between the style image and fused image should be similar , and content - relevant infor - mation [ 11 ] ( e . g . , the categories of objects ) within the fused image should also be kept from the content image . Moreover , to enhance the visual quality in artistic style transfer , contrastive learning is also introduced [ 5 , 61 ] to capture sufficient style information . Artis - tic style transfer methods stylize the entire content image , while painterly image harmonization focuses on the inserted object in the background painting . 2 . 4 Diffusion Models Recently , diffusion models have shown remarkable performance in image generation [ 21 , 34 , 51 ] , text - to - image generation [ 40 , 46 ] , image translation [ 26 ] , image inpainting [ 37 , 47 ] , and image edit - ing [ 18 , 23 , 38 , 59 ] . Image editing and cross - domain image composi - tion are the most relevant fields to our painterly image harmoniza - tion . Hence , we focus on these two fields with diffusion models in this section . Specifically , SDEdit [ 38 ] employed the image synthesis approach that commences with the addition of noise to the input image , followed by iterative denoising process with stochastic dif - ferential equation . CDC [ 18 ] proposed to harmonize the image in frequency domain by exploiting high - frequency details from the background and low - frequency style from the foreground object . Besides , there are a few diffusion models designed for artistic style transfer . To name a few , DiffStyle [ 23 ] disentangled representations for content and style , and fused them in h - space , which lies in the bottleneck of U - Net . InST [ 59 ] was motivated by the belief that an unique artwork can not be directly explained by words , so it de - signed an encoding module that maps style image into text domain through a CLIP image encoder . However , previous diffusion - based methods can not provide powerful style guidance and hold adequate content in painterly image harmonization . In this work , we endow stable diffusion with stylized feature guidance and well - designed losses for adjusting sufficient styles and maintaining content details , leading to better harmonization performance . 3 METHOD The overall framework of our PHDiffusion is depicted in Figure 2 , which consists of a Stable Diffusion ( SD ) model , an adaptive en - coder , and a Dual Encoder Fusion ( DEF ) module . Given a composite image 𝑰 𝑐 and the corresponding foreground mask 𝑴 , we first ex - ploit the adaptive encoder to extract the multi - scale composite feature maps 𝑭 𝑖𝑐 , 𝑖 ∈ { 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 } . In order to guide the generation of SD , we fuse the composite feature map 𝑭 𝑖𝑐 with the corresponding denoising feature map 𝑭 𝑖𝑧 𝑡 from the U - Net encoder of SD according to their resolutions through the DEF module to generate new de - noising feature map ˆ 𝑭 𝑖𝑧 𝑡 . Note that , we freeze the SD , and supervise the adaptive encoder and the DEF module using noise loss , content loss , and two style losses ( AdaIN loss and contrastive style loss ) . Next , we will first briefly review SD model , introduce the adap - tive encoder , and then elaborate on our DEF Module . Finally , we will introduce the objectives for training adaptive encoder and DEF . As for the notation in the remainder of this section , 𝑧 ′ 0 is the initial latent feature extracted by encoder from image 𝑰 . 𝑧 ′ 𝑡 ; 𝑡 = 1 , 2 , . . . 𝑇 represents the latent feature that is deduced from 𝑧 ′ 0 in the forward process of diffusion 𝑞 ( 𝑧 ′ 𝑡 | 𝑧 ′ 0 ) . While 𝑧 𝑡 ; 𝑡 ∈ { 𝑇 − 1 , . . . 0 } is predicted in the backward denoising process . ˜ 𝑰 0 is the decoded harmonized image from 𝑧 0 . ˆ 𝑴 is the mask that is down - sampled to size of 𝑧 ′ 0 . 3 . 1 Preliminaries Our method is built upon the Stable Diffusion ( SD ) [ 46 ] model , where SD is a latent diffusion model pretrained in two stages com - prised of an auto - encoder and a denoising U - Net . In the first stage , the SD model trains the auto - encoder , in which the encoder E first encodes images 𝑰 into latent space 𝑧 ′ 0 = E ( 𝑰 ) and then the decoder D reconstructs them into original images ˆ 𝑰 = D ( 𝑧 ′ 0 ) . In the second stage , the auto - encoder is frozen and the SD constructs the denoising U - Net 𝜖 𝜃 [ 21 ] by first adding 𝑇 - step noise to latent space feature 𝑧 ′ 0 to generate 𝑧 ′ 𝑡 ; 𝑡 = 1 , 2 , . . . 𝑇 , and then training the denoising U - Net with latent denoising loss , which is formulated as L 𝐿𝐷𝑀 : = E 𝑧 ′ 0 , 𝑦 , 𝜖 ∼N ( 0 , 1 ) , 𝑡 h (cid:13) (cid:13) 𝜖 − 𝜖 𝜃 1 (cid:0) 𝑧 ′ 𝑡 , 𝑡 , 𝜏 𝜃 2 ( 𝑦 ) (cid:1)(cid:13) (cid:13) 22 i , ( 1 ) where 𝜖 is the noise that is added in latent space feature 𝑧 ′ 0 in each noising step , 𝜖 𝜃 1 is the denoising U - Net that predicts the noise 𝜖 in current step 𝑡 , 𝑦 stands for extra condition ( e . g . , text , mask , etc . ) , and 𝜏 𝜃 2 is a domain specific encoder that projects 𝑦 to intermediate representation . In this work , we add condition information , i . e . , the composite image with foreground mask , using an adaptive encoder similar to [ 39 ] . During inference , noise is first added to 𝑧 ′ 0 to generate 𝑧 ′ 𝑇 , and then 𝑧 ′ 𝑇 is used as 𝑧 𝑇 , the initial input for 𝜖 𝜃 1 . 𝜖 𝜃 1 is then iteratively used to estimate the noise at each denoising step 𝑡 , thus the latent map 𝑧 𝑇 is gradually refined and ultimately becomes clean latent feature 𝑧 0 . Finally , the clean latent feature 𝑧 0 is fed into the decoder D to generate the image . For more details about the training and inference of Stable Diffusion , please refer to [ 46 ] . MM ’23 , October 29 - November 3 , 2023 , Ottawa , ON , Canada Lingxiao Lu , Jiangtong Li , Junyan Cao , Li Niu , and Liqing Zhang Figure 2 : The architecture of our PHDiffusion . Given an composite image 𝑰 𝑐 and its foreground mask 𝑴 , 𝑰 𝑐 is sent to a pretrained Stable Diffusion [ 7 ] model for painterly image harmonization . The input 𝑰 𝑐 is first encoded to the latent space 𝑧 ′ 0 = E ( 𝑰 𝑐 ) , which is followed by the forward process of diffusion to deduce 𝑧 ′ 𝑡 ; 𝑡 = 1 , 2 , . . . 𝑇 with noise 𝜖 . During inference , 𝑧 ′ 𝑇 is used as the initial input 𝑧 𝑇 for the backward process to predict 𝑧 𝑡 ; 𝑡 = 𝑇 − 1 , 𝑇 − 2 , . . . 0 through the denoising U - Net . Finally , the harmonized image ˜ 𝑰 0 is generated through the decoder by ˜ 𝑰 0 = D ( 𝑧 0 ) . In the meanwhile , the composite image 𝑰 𝑐 concatenated with foreground mask 𝑴 is sent to the adaptive encoder , which is followed by the Dual Encoder Fusion to provide guidance to the denoising process in U - Net . The denoising process is supervised by the noise loss L 𝐿𝐷𝑀 . Besides , we exploit two style losses ( L 𝐴𝑑𝑎𝐼𝑁 and L 𝐶𝐿 ) for foreground stylization and content loss ( L 𝑐𝑜𝑛 ) for content preservation . 3 . 2 Adaptive Encoder As introduced before , the adaptive encoder accounts for encoding additional condition and providing multi - step guidance in the de - noisingsteps . Previous implementations oftheadaptiveencoder [ 39 ] focus more on rough structures ( e . g . , sketch , pose , semantic mask ) , and exploit the text condition [ 46 ] to indicate extra demands ( e . g . , styles or environments ) . Different from previous works , we discard the text CLIP model and adopt the lightweight adaptive encoder [ 39 ] to encode the concatenation of composite image and foreground mask , simultaneously preserving content details and extracting background styles . In detail , the architecture of adaptive encoder comprises of four feature extraction blocks and three DownSam - ple ( DS for short ) blocks . The input with resolution 512 × 512 is first downsampled to 64 × 64 ( named as 𝑭 0 𝑐 ) through pixel unshuf - fle [ 48 ] . By combining one convolutional layer and two residual blocks as an extraction module ( EM for short ) , the generation of 𝑭 𝑖𝑐 , 𝑖 ∈ { 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 } can be formulated as : 𝑭 1 𝑐 = EM 1 ( 𝑭 0 𝑐 ) , 𝑭 2 𝑐 = EM 2 ( DS ( 𝑭 1 𝑐 ) ) , 𝑭 3 𝑐 = EM 3 ( DS ( 𝑭 2 𝑐 ) ) , 𝑭 4 𝑐 = EM 4 ( DS ( 𝑭 3 𝑐 ) ) , ( 2 ) where the resolutions of 𝑭 1 𝑐 , 𝑭 2 𝑐 , 𝑭 3 𝑐 , and 𝑭 4 𝑐 are 64 × 64 , 32 × 32 , 16 × 16 , and 8 × 8 , respectively . Similar structures also exist in U - Net encoder to generate 𝑭 𝑖𝑧 𝑡 with the same resolution as 𝑭 𝑖𝑐 , 𝑖 ∈ { 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 } . 3 . 3 Dual Encoder Fusion Module In the section , we introduce our Dual Encoder Fusion ( DEF ) module to preserve content of foreground object and extract reasonable style from background painting . As shown in Figure 2 , the adaptive encoder first takes composite image 𝑰 𝑐 and foreground mask 𝑴 as input , then generates the composite feature maps 𝑭 𝑖𝑐 , 𝑖 ∈ { 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 } with different resolutions . Each of the composite feature maps 𝑭 𝑖𝑐 is then fused with the corresponding denoising feature maps 𝑭 𝑖𝑧 𝑡 . However , we find that if we directly add or concatenate the feature maps from these two encoders , the final generation result cannot stylize the foreground well , leading to notable style discrepancy between foreground and background . Considering that CNN can only expand the receptive field of the foreground features within a certain range and struggles to capture long - range dependency [ 12 ] , we propose to endow the foreground features with global receptive field to some extent . To balance the global - local receptive field of the foreground features , we design different fusion strategies for the features with different resolutions . For shallow features with high resolutions , where 𝑖 ∈ { 1 , 2 } , com - posite feature maps 𝑭 𝑖𝑐 are simply added to 𝑭 𝑖𝑧 𝑡 to maintain the local structures . While for deeper features with low resolutions , where 𝑖 ∈ { 3 , 4 } , 𝑭 𝑖𝑐 and 𝑭 𝑖𝑧 𝑡 are fused through our DEF module to Painterly Image Harmonization using Diffusion Model MM ’23 , October 29 - November 3 , 2023 , Ottawa , ON , Canada Figure 3 : The architecture of Dual Encoder Fusion ( DEF ) mod - ule . Given the composite feature map 𝑭 𝑖𝑐 ( resp . , the denoising feature map 𝑭 𝑖𝑧 𝑡 ) , we stylize the foreground of composite feature map ( resp . , the denoising feature map ) by regarding the foreground feature map 𝑭 𝑖𝑐 , 𝑓 ( resp . , 𝑭 𝑖𝑧 𝑡 , 𝑓 ) as query and the background feature map 𝑭 𝑖𝑐 , 𝑏 ( resp . , 𝑭 𝑖𝑧 𝑡 , 𝑏 ) as key / value through a transformer layer to obtain the stylized foreground feature map ˆ 𝑭 𝑖𝑐 , 𝑓 ( resp . , ˆ 𝑭 𝑖𝑧 𝑡 , 𝑓 ) . Then , ˆ 𝑭 𝑖𝑐 , 𝑓 and ˆ 𝑭 𝑖𝑧 𝑡 , 𝑓 are fused through concatenation and a fully - connected layer , which is then combined with the composite background feature map 𝑭 𝑖𝑐 , 𝑏 and denoising feature map 𝑭 𝑖𝑧 𝑡 to further guide the denoising process . capture the global styles . The above process can be formulated as ˆ 𝑭 𝑖𝑧 𝑡 = ( 𝑭 𝑖𝑐 + 𝑭 𝑖𝑧 𝑡 , 𝑖 = 1 , 2 , DEF ( 𝑭 𝑖𝑐 , 𝑭 𝑖𝑧 𝑡 ) , 𝑖 = 3 , 4 . ( 3 ) The structure of our DEF module is illustrated in Figure 3 , which consists of stylized feature extraction and stylized feature fusion . 3 . 3 . 1 Stylized Feature Extraction . Before we fuse composite feature maps 𝑭 𝑖𝑐 and denoising feature maps 𝑭 𝑖𝑧 𝑡 , we first need to expand the receptive field of the foreground features and extract the desired style from background . We utilize the foreground features to search for relevant background styles through a transformer layer [ 52 ] . In detail , by taking composite feature map 𝑭 𝑖𝑐 as example , we first extract its foreground features 𝑭 𝑖𝑐 , 𝑓 and background features 𝑭 𝑖𝑐 , 𝑏 by masking and flattening , which can be formulated as 𝑭 𝑖𝑐 , 𝑓 = Flatten ( 𝑭 𝑖𝑐 ◦ ˆ 𝑴 ) , 𝑭 𝑖𝑐 , 𝑏 = Flatten ( 𝑭 𝑖𝑐 ◦ ( 1 − ˆ 𝑴 ) ) , ( 4 ) where ˆ 𝑴 denotes the foreground mask that is down - sampled to the corresponding size , ◦ represents the element - wise product , and Flatten ( · ) means the conversion from 2D feature map to 1D feature sequence . To search for the relevant background styles , we en - hance the foreground features through a transformer layer , where 𝑭 𝑖𝑐 , 𝑓 serve as queries and 𝑭 𝑖𝑐 , 𝑏 serve as keys / values . The stylized composite foreground features ˆ 𝑭 𝑖𝑐 , 𝑓 can be represented by ˆ 𝑭 𝑖𝑐 , 𝑓 = Transformer ( 𝑭 𝑖𝑐 , 𝑓 , 𝑭 𝑖𝑐 , 𝑏 , 𝑭 𝑖𝑐 , 𝑏 ) , ( 5 ) where Transformer is a transformer encoder layer [ 52 ] . Similar to 𝑭 𝑖𝑐 , the denoising feature map 𝑭 𝑖𝑧 𝑡 can also be used to get the stylized denoising foreground features ˆ 𝑭 𝑖𝑧 𝑡 , 𝑓 , so that the foreground features are stylized by relevant background styles . 3 . 3 . 2 Stylized Feature Fusion . After extracting ˆ 𝑭 𝑖𝑐 , 𝑓 and ˆ 𝑭 𝑖𝑧 𝑡 , 𝑓 for 𝑖 ∈ { 3 , 4 } , we need to leverage both ˆ 𝑭 𝑖𝑐 , 𝑓 and ˆ 𝑭 𝑖𝑧 𝑡 , 𝑓 from dual en - coders to help the denoising process . In particular , we first concate - nate ˆ 𝑭 𝑖𝑐 , 𝑓 and ˆ 𝑭 𝑖𝑧 𝑡 , 𝑓 , and then pass them through a fully - connected layer to acquire the stylized foreground features ˆ 𝑭 𝑖𝑧 𝑡 , 𝑐 . The stylized foreground features ˆ 𝑭 𝑖𝑧 𝑡 , 𝑐 are then combined with the background of composite feature map 𝑭 𝑖𝑐 and the denoising feature map 𝑭 𝑖𝑧 𝑡 to guide the denoising steps . The above steps could be formulated as ˆ 𝑭 𝑖𝑧 𝑡 , 𝑐 = FC ( ˆ 𝑭 𝑖𝑐 , 𝑓 ⊕ ˆ 𝑭 𝑖𝑧 𝑡 , 𝑓 ) , ( 6 ) ˆ 𝑭 𝑖𝑧 𝑡 = 𝑭 𝑖𝑧 𝑡 + Fold ( ˆ 𝑭 𝑖𝑧 𝑡 , 𝑐 ) + 𝑭 𝑖𝑐 ◦ ( 1 − ˆ 𝑴 ) , ( 7 ) where FC ( · ) means the fully - connected layer , ⊕ means the concate - nation between two vectors , Fold ( · ) means folding the ˆ 𝑭 𝑖𝑧 𝑡 , 𝑐 into 2D foreground map . 3 . 4 Objective Function First , we employ the standard noise loss from diffusion models [ 46 ] , which aims to reconstruct the image feature within the latent space . However , merely using noise loss can only reconstruct the com - posite image without changing the foreground style . Therefore , we employ a combination of noise loss , AdaIN loss , and contrastive style loss , with the goal of attaining a balance between reasonable style and preservation of image structures / details . Besides , content loss is employed to assist in balancing noise loss and style losses . In the following , we will detail four losses one by one . 3 . 4 . 1 Noise Loss . The denoising step of DDPM [ 21 ] is to remove noise from 𝑧 ′ 𝑇 step by step and finally reconstruct the original composite input 𝑧 ′ 0 . Therefore , the goal of the noise loss is to predict the noise in step 𝑡 , which can be formulated as L 𝐿𝐷𝑀 : = E 𝑧 ′ 0 , 𝑦 , 𝜖 ∼N ( 0 , 1 ) , 𝑡 (cid:20)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13) 𝜖 − 𝜖 𝜃 1 (cid:16) 𝑧 ′ 𝑡 , 𝑡 , 𝜏 ˆ 𝜃 2 ( 𝑦 ) (cid:17)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13) 2 2 (cid:21) , ( 8 ) in which 𝑡 is sampled from { 1 , . . . , 𝑇 } , 𝑦 is the condition information ( i . e . , composite image and foreground mask ) in our problem . 𝜖 𝜃 1 in - cludes the model parameters of denoising U - Net , while 𝜏 ˆ 𝜃 2 includes the model parameters of adaptive encoder and dual encoder fusion module . 3 . 4 . 2 AdaIN Loss . Note that the noise loss in Eqn . ( 8 ) is calcu - lated in the latent space , whereas the style losses cannot be di - rectly calculated in the latent space . Thus , we calculate two style losses based on the decoded image through decoder D , giving ˆ 𝑰 0 = D ( ˆ 𝑧 𝑡 0 ) . ˆ 𝑧 𝑡 0 = (cid:16) 𝑧 ′ 𝑡 − √ 1 − ¯ 𝛼 𝑡 𝜖 𝜃 1 (cid:16) 𝑧 ′ 𝑡 , 𝑡 , 𝜏 ˆ 𝜃 2 ( 𝑦 ) (cid:17)(cid:17) / √ ¯ 𝛼 𝑡 [ 21 ] , in which ¯ 𝛼 𝑡 = 𝑡 ˛ 𝑠 = 1 𝛼 𝑠 , 𝛼 𝑠 = 1 − 𝛽 𝑠 and 𝛽 𝑠 represents forward process variances . Based on ˆ 𝑰 0 , we can easily calculate style losses . We utilize the AdaIN style loss [ 14 ] to achieve consistency in multi - scale feature statistics ( i . e . , mean , standard deviation ) between the background painting and the foreground in the harmonized MM ’23 , October 29 - November 3 , 2023 , Ottawa , ON , Canada Lingxiao Lu , Jiangtong Li , Junyan Cao , Li Niu , and Liqing Zhang Figure 4 : Construction of a triplet of anchor , positive sample , and negative sample for contrastive style loss . image ˆ 𝑰 0 . The style loss can be written as L 𝐴𝑑𝑎𝐼𝑁 = 𝐿 ∑︁ 𝑙 = 1 (cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13) 𝜇 (cid:16) 𝜙 𝑙 (cid:16) ˆ 𝑰 0 (cid:17) ◦ ¯ 𝑴 𝑙 (cid:17) − 𝜇 (cid:16) 𝜙 𝑙 ( 𝑰 𝑏 ) (cid:17)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13) 2 2 + 𝐿 ∑︁ 𝑙 = 1 (cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13) 𝜎 (cid:16) 𝜙 𝑙 (cid:16) ˆ 𝑰 0 (cid:17) ◦ ¯ 𝑴 𝑙 (cid:17) − 𝜎 (cid:16) 𝜙 𝑙 ( 𝑰 𝑏 ) (cid:17)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13) 2 2 , ( 9 ) where 𝜙 𝑙 , 𝑙 ∈ { 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 } represents the 𝑙 - th ReLU _ 𝑙 _ 1 layer in a pre - trained VGG - 19 [ 50 ] network . 𝑰 𝑏 is the complete background painting and ¯ 𝑴 𝑙 denotes the foreground mask that is down - sampled to the corresponding size . 𝜇 ( · ) means the calculation of mean value and 𝜎 ( · ) means the calculation of standard deviation . 3 . 4 . 3 Contrastive Style Loss . To better migrate background style to foreground , we introduce another contrastive style loss , which is complementary with AdaIn loss . Contrastive style loss was first introduced into style transfer task by [ 5 ] , which distinguishes the image rendered by the reference style from other styles . Here , we adapt contrastive style loss to our painterly image harmonization task . Specifically , we construct a triplet of three elements : anchor , positive sample , and negative sample , as shown in Figure 4 . To acquire anchor , we first feed the harmonized output ˆ 𝑰 0 into pre - trained VGG - 19 network and extract the output feature map of ReLU _ 3 _ 1 layer . Then , we crop the feature map with the downsam - pled mask followed by average pooling to obtain the foreground feature , which is projected to the anchor vector 𝒇 𝑞 . Through the same procedure , positive sample 𝒇 + 𝑏 is extracted from the back - ground painting 𝑰 𝑏 , so that 𝒇 𝑞 and 𝒇 + 𝑏 share the same style . And negative samples 𝒇 − 𝑏 are extracted from other style images . Given the triplet , we tend to pull close the anchor and positive example while separating the anchor from negative examples , which can be represented as L 𝐶𝐿 = − log ' ››› › « exp (cid:18)(cid:16) 𝒇 𝑞 (cid:17) 𝑇 (cid:16) 𝒇 + 𝑏 (cid:17) / 𝜂 (cid:19) exp (cid:18) (cid:16) 𝒇 𝑞 (cid:17) 𝑇 (cid:16) 𝒇 + 𝑏 (cid:17) / 𝜂 (cid:19) + ˝ 𝒇 − 𝑏 exp (cid:18) (cid:16) 𝒇 𝑞 (cid:17) 𝑇 (cid:16) 𝒇 − 𝑏 (cid:17) / 𝜂 (cid:19) “ﬁﬁﬁ ﬁ ‹ , ( 10 ) where the temperature 𝜂 regulates the push and pull forces . We set 𝜂 as 0 . 2 following [ 5 ] . 3 . 4 . 4 Content Loss . In addition , when balancing between noise loss and style losses , chances are that the content details are exces - sively preserved , leading to insufficient style transfer . Therefore , we reduce the weight of noise loss and incorporate content loss [ 14 ] , which is commonly used in style transfer tasks . The content loss can help preserve the high - level content information without the sacrifice of styles . The content loss can be written as L 𝑐𝑜𝑛 = (cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13) 𝜙 4 (cid:16) ˆ 𝑰 0 (cid:17) − 𝜙 4 ( 𝑰 𝑐 ) (cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13) 2 2 , ( 11 ) where 𝜙 4 has been defined below Eqn . ( 9 ) . 3 . 4 . 5 Total Loss . By summarizing the noise loss , two style losses , and content loss , the total loss can be written as L 𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 = 𝜆 1 L 𝐿𝐷𝑀 + L 𝐴𝑑𝑎𝐼𝑁 + 𝜆 2 L 𝐶𝐿 + L 𝑐𝑜𝑛 , ( 12 ) in which 𝜆 1 and 𝜆 2 are hyper - parameters . We empirically set them as 60 and 5 respectively . 4 EXPERIMENTS 4 . 1 Experiment Settings We train the adaptive encoder and the fusion module for 10 epochs with a batch size of 2 . We utilize Adam as the optimizer with the learning rate of 2 × 10 − 4 . During training , we resize the input images and the mask to 512 × 512 and use the pretrained Stable Diffusion model [ 7 ] with the version of sd - v1 - 4 . We utilize the training data of COCO [ 32 ] and WikiArt [ 41 ] . For more implementation details , please refer to the supplementary . 4 . 2 Baselines Based on the target task , existing baselines can be categorized into three groups : painterly image harmonization [ 3 , 36 , 58 ] , cross - domain composition methods [ 18 , 38 ] , and artistic style transfer methods [ 10 , 22 , 35 , 43 , 59 ] . The painterly image harmonization methods include DIB [ 58 ] , DPH [ 36 ] , and PHDNet [ 3 ] . The cross - domain composition methods include CDC [ 18 ] and SDEdit [ 38 ] . TheartisticstyletransfermethodsincludeAdaIN [ 22 ] , AdaAttN [ 35 ] , SANet [ 43 ] , StyTr2 [ 10 ] , and InST [ 59 ] . Among them , CDC [ 18 ] , SDEdit [ 38 ] , and InST [ 59 ] are diffusion - based methods . For the first and the second groups , these works can stylize a cer - tain region , so we directly compare them with our results . However , for the third group , these works stylize the entire photographic im - age . To adapt artistic style transfer methods to our task , we stylize the content image according to the background image , followed by cutting and pasting the stylized foreground object onto the back - ground image . We set 𝑆𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ to 0 . 7 by default to control total inference steps for our model . More details of implementations including hyper - parameters of baselines are in the supplementary . 4 . 3 Comparisons with Baselines 4 . 3 . 1 Visualization Analysis . Compared with the first group of baselines , painterly harmonization methods , we can refer to Figure 5 for the visualization results . It is shown that our PHDiffusion can endow the foreground with more abundant and coherent styles ( row 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) . For example , as illustrated in row 1 , our PHDiffusion can not only learn the local dotted textures , but also learn the global stripe arrangement . Besides , our method can strike great balance between content and style . For content preservation , our method holds more semantic edge information ( row 1 , 2 , 3 ) , and also maintains more refined details ( row 1 ) . In row 3 , our method preserves the clear umbrella frame while capturing the textures Painterly Image Harmonization using Diffusion Model MM ’23 , October 29 - November 3 , 2023 , Ottawa , ON , Canada Figure 5 : From left to right , we show the composite image , mask , harmonized results of SDEdit , CDC , DIB , DPH , PHDNet and our PHDiffusion .

Best viewed in color and zoom in . and CDC struggle to transfer sufficient style while keeping original content ( row 1 , 3 , 4 ) . In row 1 , the content has already changed sharply while the style fails to be adapted to the target . Though CDC has learnt some dotted textures , the style and content exhibit a lack of cohesion , resembling distinct layers . And in row 3 and row 4 , the content is lost to some extent with details unrecognized . The poor performance of baselines is probably caused by the stochastic nature of diffusion model , which can be a double - edged sword for the tasks that require handling delicate details , since it is very hard to adjust hyper - parameters , ( e . g . , strength ) to balance between style and content without proper guidance . In contrast , our method provides more effective guidance for the denoising process . Compared with the third group , artistic transfer methods , as shown in Figure 6 , it can be seen that InST loses content and exhibits style incompatible with the background ( row 1 , 4 ) . Other style transfer methods can not produce adequate styles . Our method not only produces textures that highly match the background ( row 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) , but also enables the overall color distribution to be strongly correlated with the background ( row 1 , 3 ) , leading to better visual harmony . The great performance of our PHDiffusion is attributed to two aspects . Firstly , for producing sufficient styles , our DEF module can query backgrounds for reasonable styles and utilize prior knowl - edge in pretrained stable diffusion model . Secondly , for balancing content and style , the combination of noise loss , content loss , and style losses enable the adaptive encoder and DEF module to store appropriate guiding information . 4 . 3 . 2 User Study . We also conduct a user study to compare the effectiveness of various methods , following [ 3 ] . Specifically , we randomly select 100 content images from COCO [ 32 ] and 100 style images from WikiArt [ 41 ] to generate 100 composite images . Given each composite image , we can obtain 11 harmonized results includ - ing 10 baselines and our method . Then pairwise comparisons are conducted , resulting in 5 , 500 image pairs . We invite 50 users to identify the more harmonious one in each pair . Finally 275 , 000 com - parison results are collected , followed by using the Bradley - Terry ( B - T ) model [ 1 , 27 ] to calculate an overall ranking of all methods . As presented in Table 1 , our PHDiffusion achieves the highest B - T score . 4 . 4 Ablation Studies As described in Section 3 , our PHDiffusion exploits an adaptive encoder along with the dual encoder fusion module to guide the denoising process and two style losses to balance the content and style . Therefore , in this section , we demonstrate their effectiveness , and report B - T score in Table 2 and visual results in Figure 7 . For the effectiveness of style losses , we conduct experiments without contrastive style loss ( V1 ) or AdaIN loss ( V2 ) . For the effectiveness of transformer layer in DEF module , we conduct experiments in the following three settings : ( 1 ) remove transformer layers in both encoders ( V3 ) ; ( 2 ) remove transformer layer in adaptive encoder ( V4 ) ; ( 3 ) remove transformer layer in U - Net encoder ( V5 ) . Comparing V1 , V2 , and V6 in Table 2 , we find that the AdaIN loss is more important for style transfer , while the contrastive style loss assists in capturing more reasonable styles . Moreover , by comparing V3 , V4 , V5 , and V6 in Table 2 , we can find that the transformer layers in U - Net encoder and adaptive encoder are both helpful to generate reasonable styles , and exploiting transformer layer in both encoders can further boost the painterly image harmonization . For visual results in Figure 7 , comparing V1 , V2 , and V6 , it is observed that AdaIN loss ( V1 ) can learn styles that appear to be blended , while contrastive style loss ( V2 ) tends to learn fine textures ( more haziness for cup and more textures of the fur for bear ) while maintaining the original color . So the combination of two style losses helps the transformer capture adequate local textures and fine global styles . Comparing V3 and V4 ( V3 and V5 ) in Figure 7 , we can find that the transformer can help learn more consistent and reasonable styles from the background . Comparing V4 , V5 , and V6 in Figure 7 , it is observed that the adaptive encoder prefers more subdued color ( V5 ) while the U - Net encoder tends to perform more exaggerated color ( V4 ) . Balancing them can achieve more reasonable and harmonized styles for our final result ( V6 ) . 5 CONCLUSION In this work , we have introduced diffusion model into painterly im - age harmonization . We have proposed a novel Painterly Harmoniza - tion stable Diffusion model ( PHDiffusion ) , in which the denoising process of diffusion is under the guidance of lightweight adaptive encoder and dual encoder fusion . Experiments have demonstrated that our approach can simultaneously preserve detailed content and produce sufficient styles , surpassing the state - of - the - art methods .

A DATASET AND IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS We conduct experiments on two benchmark datasets , i . e . , COCO [ 5 ] and WikiArt [ 9 ] , where COCO is a large - scale photograph dataset with the instance segmentation annotation for 80 different object categories and WikiArt is a large - scale digital art dataset consisting of 27 distinct styles . These two datasets are used to produce com - posite images by inserting photographic foreground objects from COCO into painterly backgrounds from WikiArt . In detail , to obtain the foreground object with proper size and res - olution , we select 9 , 100 foreground images from the COCO dataset , whose foreground ratio is between 0 . 05 and 0 . 3 , and width and height are ≥ 480 . Moreover , we select 37 , 931 background images from the WikiArt dataset , whose width and height are ≥ 512 .

Finally , all the composite image are resized to 512 × 512 for training . This process can produce composite images with discordant visual elements . Our network is implemented using Pytorch 1 . 11 . 0 . And the train - ing process is executed on an Ubuntu 20 . 04 LTS operating system , utilizing a computing environment comprising of 32GB memory , Intel Xeon Silver 4116 CPU , and two GeForce RTX 3090 GPUs . B STRENGTH CONTROL 𝑆𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ is a hyper - parameter that decides the total step in the inference process . For example , the total step is equal to 35 when 𝑆𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ is 0 . 7 and default total step is 50 . The larger total step means more noise to be added and removed , leading to larger vari - ability , so that the guidance from condition information could have greater impact on the harmonized results . We observe that when 𝑆𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ grows larger in a proper range ( i . e . , 0 . 1 - 0 . 7 ) , the style of our harmonized result gets transferred gradually while the content details are barely changed . However , as the 𝑆𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ changes , other diffusion model baselines cannot balance the style and content . In Figure 1 , we visualize how the harmonization results changes as the strength changes . In detail , we compare the harmonization results of SDEdit [ 8 ] , CDC [ 3 ] , InST [ 12 ] , and our PHDiffusion with the 𝑆𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ ranging from 0 . 1 to 0 . 9 . Recall that the inference process of diffusion model is under control of the 𝑆𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ , where the smaller the 𝑆𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ is , the smaller the denoising step is . If the denoising process is guided improperly or without guidance , the style and the content cannot be balanced as the 𝑆𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ changes . In detail , for SDEdit [ 8 ] and InST [ 12 ] in Figure 1 , as the 𝑆𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ becomes larger , the style is more sufficient while the content is destroyed . For CDC [ 3 ] , since the denoising process is guided by the composite image , as the 𝑆𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ gets larger , the content details are more preserved while the style is ignored ; however , as the 𝑆𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ gets smaller , the style is more sufficient while the content is destroyed . Besides , the balanced point for CDC [ 3 ] is also quite vulnerable . However , if this process is guided by our DEF module , it can be tailored to painterly image harmonization with smooth transi - tion between original and target styles without destroying content . a r X i v : 2308 . 02228v1 [ c s .

𝑺𝒕𝒓𝒆𝒏𝒈𝒕𝒉 is set to 0 . 1 , 0 . 3 , 0 . 5 , 0 . 7 , 0 . 9 from left to right for each method . We also present the results of Ours , CDC , SDEdit , and InST for comparison . Figure 2 : The attention maps in DEF module for Adaptive Encoder and U - Net Encoder . For U - Net Encoder , we present its attention maps in different timesteps . Specifically , from our harmonization results in Figure 1 , we observe that the styles are progressively strengthened while content is well - preserved ( details such as eyes in the second example and words on the airplane in the third example remain visually clear ) . This proves that diffusion process is highly controllable and our mechanism can provide powerful guidance for the diffusion process . C VISUALIZATION OF ATTENTION MAPS FOR DUAL ENCODER FUSION To better understand the transformers in DEF module , we visualize the attention maps of transformers during inference in Figure 2 . Since the feature maps in adaptive encoder remain the same during multi - step inference , so its attention maps also remain the same . In contrast , the feature maps in U - Net encoder are updated during multi - step inference , so the attention maps vary in different steps . Therefore , in Figure 2 , we show how the attention maps in U - Net encoder changes during denoising steps . Specifically , each attention map is obtained by averaging the attention maps from all atten - tion heads , and then resized to the original resolution . In Figure 2 , it can be observed that , for composite image whose background has similar objects with foreground , these objects can be detected and attended by the transformer layer , so that these objects in the background usually have larger weights . For example , in row 1 of Figure 2 , the wolf in the background , which is similar to the foreground dog , gains attention in both adaptive encoder and U - Net encoder . For U - Net encoder in different steps , the wolves are all attended . Moreover , the ground surrounding the dog , which has similar color to the dog , is also attended by our DEF module .

Besides , for composite image whose background has pure textures ( row 2 ) , the DEF module seems to pay attention to the background randomly for both adaptive and U - Net encoders to capture the over - all pattern . These visualization results again prove that our DEF module can focus on meaningful background regions and provide rational guidance during the denoising steps . D COMPARISON WITH BASELINES D . 1 Details of Diffusion - based Baselines For all the diffusion - based baselines , since the 𝑆𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ has great influence on the harmonization results , we adjust the 𝑆𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ and select the optimal outcome for comparison . Therefore , we set 𝑆𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ to 0 . 5 , 0 . 5 and 0 . 7 for SDEdit [ 8 ] , CDC [ 3 ] and InST [ 12 ] , respectively , which are the best results for balancing content and style . For our PHDiffusion , we choose 𝑆𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ = 0 . 7 by default . Besides , to adapt style transfer method InST [ 12 ] for painterly image harmonization , for training process , we train the proposed small conditional network on WikiArt while freezing the diffusion model , after which the model is able to learn styles in WikiArt better . Moreover , during inference , we first add noise for 𝑇 steps to the composite image in forward process . During each backward step , we exploit the corresponding background in 𝑖 - th forward step to replace the background of predicted images in ( 𝑇 − 𝑖 ) - th background step , which aims to preserve the background and only adapt the foreground to satisfy the demand of painterly image harmonization . D . 2 More Visual Results We provide more visual results to compare with other baselines . As we have introduced in the main submission , we have three groups of baselines . The first group contains painterly image harmoniza - tion methods , DIB [ 11 ] , DPH [ 7 ] , and PHDNet [ 1 ] . The second group includes cross - domain composition methods , CDC [ 3 ] and SDEdit [ 8 ] . And the third group , artistic style transfer , consists of AdaIN [ 4 ] , AdaAttN [ 6 ] , SANet [ 10 ] , StyTr2 [ 2 ] , and InST [ 12 ] . The results for the first and second group are shown in Figure 4 , while the results for the third group are shown in Figure 5 . In Figure 4 , it can be seen that DIB [ 11 ] , DPH [ 7 ] and PHD - Net [ 1 ] can also achieve harmonization to some extent , but the learnt textures are not as accurate as ours ( row 1 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 10 ) . Be - sides , our PHDiffusion can capture more global styles , thus tending to be more naturally blended with the background ( row 2 , 6 , 7 , 8 ) . Specifically , our PHDiffusion is able to maintain more semantic information and content details ( e . g . , the stripes on the body of the cat in row 8 and the pattern on the shirt of the man in row 7 ) . And for cross - domain methods in Figure 4 , it is obvious that SDEdit [ 8 ] tends to directly copy the content of foreground objects ( row 2 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 10 ) , and the style is not compatible with the background images . Besides , CDC [ 3 ] fails to preserve the content details ( row 1 , 3 , 5 , 9 , 10 ) . The comparison between our PHDiffusion and other cross - domain methods ( i . e . , SDEdit [ 8 ] and CDC [ 3 ] ) turns out that our method outperforms them in both style and content . For the third group in Figure 5 , it can be observed that InST [ 12 ] has lost too much content details . Though its learnt style is quite consistent with the background , the harmonization results from InST [ 12 ] are still less realistic ( row 1 , 4 , 6 ) . Moreover , for AdaIN [ 4 ] , AdaAttN [ 6 ] , SANet [ 10 ] , and StyTr2 [ 2 ] , they can also partially migrate the background style , however , the styles in our results are obviously more harmonized ( row 3 to row 9 ) . For various types of backgrounds , our harmonization results always behave well in holding semantic information ( row 3 , 7 , 9 ) . Overall , for our har - monization results , the inserted foreground objects can be better integrated into the background , making the whole harmonized images appear to be intact artistic paintings . E LIMITATIONS Generally speaking , our method is capable of producing visually appealing and harmonious results , however , some types of fore - ground objects such as human faces are still hard to be in great harmony with the backgrounds . Since human faces have delicate details and we are very sensitive to the subtle changes in human faces , it is very difficult to sufficiently stylize the human faces while preserving their delicate details .
