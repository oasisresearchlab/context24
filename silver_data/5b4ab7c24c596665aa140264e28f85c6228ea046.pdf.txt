The novel adaptor protein Swiprosin - 1 enhances BCR signals and contributes to BCR - induced apoptosis A Avramidou 1 , 2 , 3 , C Kroczek 1 , 2 , C Lang 1 , W Schuh 1 , H - M Ja¨ck 1 and D Mielenz * , 1 B - cell receptor ( BCR ) signals are essential for B - cell differentiation , homeostasis and negative selection , which are regulated by the strength and quality of BCR signals . Recently , we identiﬁed a new adaptor protein , Swiprosin - 1 , in lipid rafts of B - cell lines that undergo apoptosis after BCR stimulation . During murine B - cell development , Swiprosin - 1 exhibited highest expression in immature B cells of the bone marrow , but was also expressed in resting and activated splenic B cells and in non - lymphoid tissue , especially in the brain . Ectopic expression of Swiprosin - 1 in the immature murine B - cell line WEHI231 enhanced spontaneous and BCR - induced apoptosis . In contrast , short hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) - mediated downregulation of Swiprosin - 1 impaired speciﬁcally spontaneous and BCR - elicited apoptosis , but not BCR - induced G1 cell cycle arrest and upregulation of the cell cycle inhibitor p27 Kip1 . In accordance , Swiprosin - 1 abundance regulated net cell growth of WEHI231 cell populations through reciprocal regulation of Bcl - xL , but not Bim , thereby controlling spontaneous apoptosis . Swiprosin - 1 - enhanced apoptosis was blocked through nuclear factor j B - activating stimuli , namely B - cell - activating factor of the TNF family , anti - CD40 and lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) . This correlated with enhanced BCR - induced I j B - a phosphorylation and degradation in cells expressing a Swiprosin - 1 - speciﬁc shRNA . Finally , ectopic Swiprosin - 1 expression enhanced BCR - induced cell death in primary , LPS - stimulated splenic B cells . Hence , Swiprosin - 1 may regulate lifespan and BCR signaling thresholds in immature B cells . Cell Death and Differentiation ( 2007 ) 14 , 1936 – 1947 ; doi : 10 . 1038 / sj . cdd . 4402206 ; published online 3 August 2007 Antigen - induced positive selection and homeostasis of B lymphocytes in secondary lymphatic organs are , besides other factors , controlled by the B - cell receptor ( BCR ) . 1 The IgM BCR complex consisting of two Ig heavy ( m ) and light chains as well as the signaling molecules Ig a and Ig b is ﬁrst presented on the surface of immature B cells in the bone marrow . Here , the BCR is tested for binding to self in order to avoid generation of self - reactive B cells , since failure to establish tolerance during early B - cell development can cause antibody - mediated autoimmune diseases . Immature B cells migrate then as transitional ( T1 ) B cells to the spleen where they develop into T2 B cells and further on develop into mature B cells . At this transition , BCR signaling is essential for survival , 2 whereby the strength of the BCR signal regulates development of immature B cells into B1 - , B2 - and marginal zone B cells . 3 The quality of the BCR signal is regulated in a developmental manner : BCR engagement by self - antigen prevents T1 B - cell maturation through clonal deletion , whereas encounter of the BCR in mature B cells initiates proliferation and , with speciﬁc costimulation , differentiation into plasma cells . 4 Since one B cell expresses the same BCR during its differentiation from immature to mature cell and the BCR is required for immature and mature B - cell homeo - stasis , 1 , 5 a key question is how the BCR mediates three physiological outcomes , namely survival , differentiation or apoptosis . One possibility are different BCR signaling modes in immature and mature B cells . 4 , 6 Calcium mobilization and tyrosine phosphorylation patterns differ qualitatively in im - mature and mature B lymphocytes 6 , 7 but quantitative differ - ences have also been reported . Speciﬁcally , transitional immature B cells in an autoreconstitution system responded to IgM stimulation at ﬁve times lower doses of anti - IgM antibodies than mature B cells . 7 This suggests that the BCR signaling threshold is regulated between immature and mature B cells , possibly by sequential expression of signaling molecules during B - cell development . 6 , 8 Another possibility is different compartmentalization of the BCR in the plasma membrane . Many BCR signaling molecules are concentrated in cholesterol - dependent micro - domains ( lipid rafts ) in the plasma membrane . Lipid rafts therefore represent essential platforms for BCR signaling . 9 Interestingly , in immature B - cell lines , the BCR appears to be excluded from lipid rafts . 10 , 11 Moreover , primary immature , transitional B cells have lower amounts of cholesterol in their plasma membrane than mature B cells , explaining the failure of the BCR to become stabilized in lipid rafts upon BCR crosslinking in immature B cells . 12 Differences in the protein composition of lipid rafts between mature and immature Received 20 . 11 . 06 ; revised 21 . 6 . 07 ; accepted 25 . 6 . 07 ; Edited by B Osborne ; published online 03 . 8 . 07 1 Division of Molecular Immunology , Department of Internal Medicine III , Nikolaus Fiebiger Center for Molecular Medicine , University of Erlangen - Nu¨rnberg , Germany * Corresponding author : D Mielenz , Division of Molecular Immunology , Department of Internal Medicine III , Nikolaus Fiebiger Center for Molecular Medicine , Glu¨ckstr . 6 , Erlangen 91054 , Germany .

Over - expression of Swiprosin - 1 in the immature B - cell line WEHI231 enhanced spontaneous and BCR - induced apopto - sis . In contrast , shRNA - mediated silencing of Swiprosin - 1 suppressed apoptosis following BCR ligation . Finally , Swiprosin - 1 regulated net cell growth of WEHI231 cells through control of spontaneous apoptosis . Our ﬁndings support the conclusion that Swiprosin - 1 regulates apoptosis and inﬂuences BCR signaling in immature B cells . Results Structure and expression of Swiprosin - 1 . The aim of this study was to characterize Swiprosin - 1 . Swiprosin - 1 is a 240 amino - acid protein with predicted and apparent molecular weights of 27 and 33kDa , respectively . 14 , 15 Comparison of amino - acid sequences revealed that mouse Swiprosin - 1 ( NM _ 025994 ) is almost identical to human ( NM _ 024329 ) ( 91 % ) and rat orthologues ( NM _ 001031648 ) ( 98 % ) . Rat and human Swiprosin - 1 are 93 % identical ( Figure 1a ) . Primary and secondary structure analysis ( Figure 1b ) showed that Swiprosin - 1 putatively contains four myristylation sites , lipid modiﬁcations known to play a role in association of proteins with lipid rafts , 16 three binding sites for SH3 domain containing proteins , two EF - hand domains and a coiled - coil domain at the C - terminus . These features could indicate a function for Swiprosin - 1 as small adaptor protein involved in Ca 2 þ signaling . To analyze the expression of Swiprosin - 1 , we performed Northern blot analysis . As predicted from the cDNA sequence , a Swiprosin - 1 message of 2 . 4 kb length was detected in spleen , lung and liver with highest abundance in brain and lowest abundance in kidney and thymus ( Figure 1c ) . We further analyzed expression of Swiprosin - 1 during B - cell development . Semiquantitative RT - PCR analysis revealed that Swiprosin - 1 is expressed throughout B - cell differentia - tion , with highest expression in immature bone marrow B cells ( Figure 1d ) . In contrast , Swiprosin - 2 , a close homolog , is expressed only in pro - B cells ( our unpublished data ) . To test whether activation of mature B cells affects expression of Swiprosin - 1 , mature splenic B cells were stimulated with anti - IgM F ( ab ) 2 / IL - 4 , LPS or anti - CD40 / IL - 4 . Western blot analysis ( Figure 1e ) showed that there was no obvious change in Swiprosin - 1 expression following stimulation for up to 96h . Involvement of Swiprosin - 1 in immature B - cell apoptosis . We originally identiﬁed Swiprosin - 1 in lipid rafts of the immature B - cell line WEHI231 . 14 To characterize Swiprosin - 1 , we infected WEHI231 cells with a retrovirus encoding Myc - tagged Swiprosin - 1 ( pSw1Myc ) or with empty virus , pMSCVpuro ( pMSCV ) . Expression of Sw1myc was veriﬁed by western blotting with anti - Swiprosin - 1 ( Figure 2a ) and anti - Myc antibodies ( not shown ) . Initially , we observed a signiﬁcant amount of dead cells in puromycin - resistant cultures transduced with pSwiMyc . To investigate whether this was due to apoptosis , we used an early marker , namely loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential ( DC m ) . 17 Cells were labeled with 3 , 3 0 - dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide ( DioC6 ) , a ﬂuorochrome that stains mitochondria in a DC m - dependent manner , 18 and with propidium iodide ( PI ) , to identify secondary necrotic cells . This revealed an increased frequency of PI - negative cells with reduced DC m in pSwiMyc - transduced WEHI231 cells , but not in untrans - duced or pMSCV - transduced cells ( Figure 2b ) , indicating that Swiprosin - 1 might induce apoptosis through the mito - chondrial pathway . In immature , transitional B cells , BCR stimulation results in induction of apoptosis 4 and WEHI231 cells serve as a model system for this process . 19 To examine involvement of Swiprosin - 1 in BCR - mediated apoptosis , we analyzed WEHI231wt , pMSCV - and pSw1Myc - transduced cells with AnnexinV ( AnxV ) / PI staining before and after BCR stimulation ( Figure 2d ) ( representative analysis in Figure 2c ) . BCR engagement led to an increase in early apoptotic ( AnxV þ / PI (cid:3) ) and secondary necrotic cells ( AnxV þ / PI þ ) in the wt population ( total of 17 . 6 % after 20h ) ( Figure 2d ) . How - ever , after 20h , pSw1Myc - transduced WEHI231 cultures contained on the average 61 % total apoptotic cells after BCR stimulation , that is 3 . 7 - fold more apoptotic cells than in wt cells . After 20h , pMSCV - transduced cells displayed on the average 35 . 1 % of total apoptotic cells , equivalent to a two - fold increase over wt cells . Although pMSCV - transduced cells showed increased apoptosis in this assay compared to wt cells , pSwiMyc - transduced cells were almost twice as apoptotic as pMSCV - transduced cells , indicating a speciﬁc Swiprosin - 1 effect . When left unstimulated , pSwiMyc - transduced WEHI231 cells were on the average more apoptotic ( 8 % ) after 20h than pMSCV - transduced ( 4 . 9 % ) or wt cells ( 4 . 4 % ) ( Figure 2d ) . These results , together with the observation that pSwiMyc - transduced cells displayed a decreased DC m under normal culture conditions , indicated that overexpression of Swiprosin - 1 starts an apoptotic program amplifying proapoptotic BCR signals in WEHI231 cells . To conﬁrm these data , we silenced Swiprosin - 1 stably via expression of a Swiprosin - 1 speciﬁc shRNA ( pshSw1 ) . The empty vector ( pSuper ; pSp ) ( Figure 3a ) and a vector expressing a scrambled shRNA ( pScrambled ; pScr ) with the same nucleotide content as the Swiprosin - 1 - speciﬁc RNA ( Figure 3b ) served as controls . After 20h of stimulation , pshSw1 - WEHI231 cells showed on the average 4 . 9 % apoptotic cells in comparison to the pSp - WEHI231 cells and wt cells that exhibited 13 or 14 . 1 % apoptotic cells , respectively ( Figure 3a ) . This effect was speciﬁc since control clones expressing the scrambled shRNA ( pScr ) exhibited more apoptotic cells than pshSw1 clones ( Figure 3b ) . Thus , it was not simply expression of shRNA that protected WEHI231 cells from apoptosis . Since the decrease of DC m ( Figure 2b ) pointed to activation of the central , caspase - dependent apoptotic pathway , 17 we investigated whether Swiprosin - 1 induced caspase activation . In fact , pSwiMyc - transduced cells exhibited a prominent signal of the large fragment of caspase 7 ( p20 ) ( Figure 3c , lane 8 ) , representing active caspase 7 . Similar results were Swiprosin - 1 in B - cell apoptosis and growth A Avramidou et al 1937 Cell Death and Differentiation obtained for caspase 3 ( data not shown ) . Collectively , these data demonstrate that Swiprosin - 1 does not only induce , but even appears to be required for BCR - elicited apoptosis of WEHI231 cells . Swiprosin - 1 sets the threshold for BCR signaling and regulates net cell growth of WEHI231 cells . The balance between pro - and antiapoptotic signals in immature B cells determines BCR signaling threshold and survival of immature B cells in the bone marrow . 20 Since Swiprosin - 1 was most abundant in immature B cells ( Figure 1d ) , and since Swiprosin - 1 ampliﬁed spontaneous and BCR - induced apoptosis in WEHI231 cells ( Figure 2d ) , we speculated that the amount of Swiprosin - 1 could set the BCR signaling threshold in immature B cells . If this was true , the BCR should elicit a response at much lower antigen doses in cells overexpressing Swiprosin - 1 . Thus , we treated pSw1Myc - , pshSw1 - , pMSCV - and pSp - WEHI231 cells with increasing concentrations of cross - linking anti - m heavy chain ( m Hc ) F ( ab ) 2 for 20h . This resulted in an increase of apoptotic cells in pSwiMyc - , pMSCV - and pSp - cells , concomitant with the concentration of stimulating antibody ( Figure 4 ) . However , pSw1Myc - transduced cells exhibited more apoptosis compared to pMSCV cells at each antibody concentration ( compare open and ﬁlled squares ) . Moreover , saturation was reached later , namely at 0 . 75 m g / ml , in pSwiMyc - transduced Figure 1 Sequence and expression analysis of Swiprosin - 1 .

Cell lysates ( 30 m g ) per lane were subjected to western blotting with anti - m Hc , anti - Sw1 and anti - Erk antibodies . Molecular mass standards ( kDa ) are shown on the left . Sw1 : Swiprosin - 1 , m Hc : m heavy chain Swiprosin - 1 in B - cell apoptosis and growth A Avramidou et al 1938 Cell Death and Differentiation cells , whereas a saturating response was reached already at 0 . 25 m g / ml in pMSCV - and pSp cells . In contrast , pshSw1 cells exhibited almost no apoptotic response ( compare open and ﬁlled triangles ) . These results indicated that Swiprosin - 1 lowers the BCR signaling threshold , which in WEHI231 cells leads to increased BCR - elicited apoptosis . Since we observed spontaneous apoptosis in untreated pSwiMyc - transduced WEHI231 cells ( Figure 2 ) , we hypothe - sized that the amount of Swiprosin - 1 protein could also affect net cell increase . Therefore , we analyzed cell growth of pSwiMyc - , pMSCV - , pSp - and pshSw1 - WEHI231 cells ( Figure 5 ) . Interestingly , pSwiMyc - transduced cultures grew slower than pMSCV - and pSp cells , whereas pshSw1 cells grew faster than pMSCV - and pSp cells . Thus , decreased expression of Swiprosin - 1 promotes survival and results in increased WEHI231 populations . Swiprosin - 1 contributes to BCR - induced apoptosis but not to BCR - induced G1 arrest . Net cell growth can also be inﬂuenced by cell cycle regulation and in WEHI231 cells , treatment with anti - IgM induces growth arrest in G0 / G1 phase . 21 Thus , we analyzed the impact of Swiprosin - 1 on the cell cycle . Figure 6a displays a representative ﬂow cytometric analysis of WEHI231wt cells with characteristic G1 arrest and an increase of cells with subdiploid ( subG1 ; apoptotic ) DNA content after BCR stimulation . 21 In the absence of anti - IgM stimulation , pshSw1 - WEHI231 cells in contrast to pSp - WEHI231 cells contained a decreased subG1 population and a slightly increased G2 / M population after 24h . After 48h , only a decreased subG1 peak was visible ( Figure 6b ) . In stark contrast , pSw1Myc - WEHI231 cells displayed increased subG1 populations and decreased G2 / M populations both after 24 and 48h compared to pMSCV cells ( Figure 6d ) . In the presence of stimulating anti - IgM antibody , pshSw1 - WEHI231 cells showed a signiﬁcantly reduced subG1 peak after 24 and 48h , and increased G2 / M populations when compared to pSp - WEHI231 cells ( Figure 6c ) . Conversely , both after 24 and 48h , pSwiMyc - WEHI231 cells featured strongly increased subG1 populations , concomitant with an accelerated decrease of cells in G2 / M ( Figure 6e ) . Of note here is that ﬁrst , pshSw1 - WEHI231 cells did undergo G0 / G1 cell cycle arrest after anti - IgM stimulation ( Figure 6c ) and second , pSwiMyc - WEHI231 cells hardly arrested at G0 / G1 but rather went directly into apoptosis ( Figure 6e ) . Thus , BCR - induced G0 / G1 arrest takes place also in the absence of Swiprosin - 1 , but with delayed onset . To verify these data , we analyzed expression of p27 Kip1 , a cyclin - dependent kinase inhibitor that becomes upregulated after BCR Figure 2 Effect of Swiprosin - 1 overexpression on WEHI231 cells . ( a ) Lysates from uninfected WEHI231 cells ( wt ) , WEHI231 cells retrovirally transduced with empty vector ( pMSCV ) , or with a Sw1myc - coding vector ( pSw1Myc ) were analyzed by western blotting with the indicated antibodies .

Cells were stained with AnnexinV - FITC ( AnxV - FITC ) and PI and analyzed by ﬂow cytometry . The gates used to evaluate AnxV þ and AnxV þ / PI þ cells are indicated in the dot plots . ( d ) WEHI231wt , pMSCV - and pSw1Myc - infected cells were treated with 10 m g / ml goat anti - mouse IgM F ( ab ) 2 fragment for the indicated times , or left untreated for 20h ( 0 ) , and evaluated by ﬂow cytometry using AnxV - FITC / PI staining . Data are presentedas mean 7 S . D . of triplicates . Representative results of three independent experiments are shown . Numbers indicate the different clones used in this experiment Swiprosin - 1 in B - cell apoptosis and growth A Avramidou et al 1939 Cell Death and Differentiation stimulation in WEHI231 cells to induce G1 arrest . 21 In keeping with the results of the cell cycle analyses , p27 Kip1 was upregulated 2 . 2 - , 1 . 9 - and 1 . 8 - fold in pSp - , pshSw1 and pMSCV - WEHI231 cells , but only 1 . 2 - fold in pSwiMyc - WEHI231 cells , respectively ( Figure 7a ) . Thus , Swiprosin - 1 overexpression enhances spontaneous and BCR - elicited apoptosis , the latter probably through acceleration of the G1 – SubG1 transition . Conversely , downregulation of Swiprosin - 1 protects WEHI231 cells from apoptosis , but not from BCR - induced G0 / G1 arrest . However , pshSw1 - WEHI231 cells do undergo apoptosis and G2 / M arrest after g - irradiation ( Supplementary Figure 1 ) . Bcl - 2 ( BH ) homology proteins , such as Bim or Bcl - xL , regulate apoptosis through formation of pro - or antiapoptotic heterodimers . Since Bim is pro - and Bcl - xL is antiapoptotic in primary immature and in WEHI231 B cells , 22 , 23 we next examined their abundance . Bcl - xL was roughly three - fold decreased in WEHI231 cells overexpressing Swiprosin - 1 Figure 3 Effect of Swiprosin - 1 silencing on BCR - induced apoptosis of WEHI231 cells .

Molecular mass standards ( kDa ) are indicated on the left Swiprosin - 1 in B - cell apoptosis and growth A Avramidou et al 1940 Cell Death and Differentiation ( calculation based on dilution analysis ; Figure 7b ) . We corroborated these results by semiquantitative RT - PCR analysis where we observed a reduction in Bcl - xL mRNA ( note that Bcl - 2 mRNA was not changed ; data not shown ) . Conversely , Bcl - xL protein was on the average three - fold more abundant in Swiprosin - 1 - silenced cells compared to control clones ( Figure 7c ) . In contrast , proapoptotic Bim protein was not enhanced ( Figure 7b ) . Taken together , these results indicate that Swiprosin - 1 abundance regulates Bcl - xL amounts reciprocally on the transcriptional level and thereby inﬂuences proapoptotic BCR signaling . Swiprosin - 1 is involved in nuclear factor j B signaling . The BCR activates the canonical nuclear factor k B ( NF - k B ) pathway where phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of inhibitors of NF - k B ( I k B ) lead to unmasking of NF - k B nuclear localization sequences and nuclear import of p50 / p65 NF - k B heterodimers . 24 , 25 Bcl - xL is a target gene of the canonical NF - k B pathway 26 and thus , cells devoid of Swiprosin - 1 should positively regulate NF - k B in response to BCR stimulation . Indeed , BCR stimulation of pshSw1 - WEHI231 cells induced strong I k B - a phosphoryl - ation ( Figure 8a ) , which was not observed in control cells or in Swiprosin - 1 - overexpressing cells ( Figure 8b – d ) . Con - comitantly , BCR - induced I k B - a degradation was enhanced in pshSw1 - WEHI231 cells ( Figure 8e ) . In contrast , BCR - induced , transient p42 / 44 - MAPK / Erk ( mitogen - activated protein kinase / extracellular signal - regulated kinase ) activation was similar in all cell lines examined ( Figure 8 ) . Collectively , our data suggest that Swiprosin - 1 is part of the BCR signaling pathway and plays a role as negative regulator of the canonical NF - k B - activating branch . In support of this , we observed constitutive colocalization of a Swiprosin - 1 - EGFP fusion protein with the BCR in unstimulated cells , and partial cocapping with the BCR in BCR - stimulated WEHI231 cells ( Supplementary Figure 2 ) . If decreased NF - k B activity and decreased abundance of Bcl - xL were responsible for increased apoptosis of pSwiMyc - transduced WEHI231 cells , activation of NF - k B should reverse this effect . Coincubation of pSwiMyc - transduced WEHI231 cells with agonistic anti - IgM mAb plus NF - k B - inducing stimuli of B cells , namely BAFF ( B - cell activating factor of the TNF family ) , 26 anti - CD40 mAb 27 and LPS ( lipopolysaccharide ) , 24 alleviated apoptosis in pSwiMyc - transduced cells to that of the control cells ( pMSCV ) ( Figure 9a ) . LPS pretreatment also reduced cell death induced by transient transduction of WEHI231 cells with the GFP - encoding retroviral vector pCru5 - Sw1myc - IRES - GFP ( 9 . 4 – 3 . 6 % after 24h , 64 – 48 . 9 % after 48h ) , but hardly cell death in empty vector ( pCru5 - IRES - GFP ) - transduced cells ( 3 . 8 – 3 . 7 % after 24h , 35 . 3 – 31 . 1 % after 48h ; Figure 9b ) . Hence , NF - k B activation counteracts Swiprosin - 1 - induced apoptosis in immature B cells .

To investigate the function of Swiprosin - 1 in primary B cells , we retrovirally transduced freshly isolated splenic B cells from adult C57Bl / 6 mice with pCru5 - Sw1myc - IRES - GFP or the control vector , pCru5 - IRES - GFP . Splenic B cells of mature mice are mostly mature , with a IgM low / IgD high phenotype ( Figure 10a ) , but do contain immature , T1 B cells of the IgM high / IgD low phenotype , the target of negative BCR selection . 2 To retrovirally transduce primary B cells efﬁciently , entry into the cell cycle is necessary and best achieved by preactivating freshly isolated primary B cells with LPS . After BCR engagement , we detected an increase in the frequency of apoptotic cells ( AnxV positive ) from 38 to 57 % in pSw1Myc - transduced cultures . BCR engagement also increased the frequency of apoptotic cells in primary cultures transduced with the GFP control vector ( Figure 10b ) . However , the difference in the frequencies before and after BCR engagement was clearly smaller in control vector - transduced cells than in pSw1Myc - transduced cells and changed after addition of anti - IgM antibodies only from 55 to 61 % . Vice versa , the frequency of live cells decreased sig - niﬁcantly after BCR engagement in pSwiMyc - transduced cultures from 61 to 42 % , but in control vector - transduced cultures only from 44 to 39 % . Thus , Swiprosin - 1 appears to amplify proapoptotic BCR signals not only in transformed B - lymphoma cells but also in primary B cells . Discussion Here we report a function of the novel adaptor protein Swiprosin - 1 ( synonym : Efhd2 ; www . ensembl . org ) : Swipro - sin - 1 regulates speciﬁcally apoptosis , but not cell cycling , in an immature B - cell line . During B - cell differentiation and the humoral immune response , regulation of apoptosis is extremely important . For example , only about 3 % of the new B cells generated daily reach the long - lived B - cell pool in the periphery , 2 and apoptosis controls the pool of activated plasma blasts and selection in germinal centers . Despite being proapoptotic in an immature B - cell line , Swiprosin - 1 is expressed in similar amounts in all murine B - cell lines examined ( not shown ) and in resting and activated splenic B cells . Thus , there must be mechanisms regulating Swiprosin - 1 function . We exclude interactions with Swiprosin - 2 ( Efhd1 ) because during B - cell differentiation , Swiprosin - 2 is only expressed in pro - B cells ( unpublished data ) . Since Swiprosin - 1 is likely involved in EGF receptor signaling 28 and is not exclusively expressed in lymphoid tissue , it probably functions in a cell - type - speciﬁc manner . This may be due to different subcellular localization , sequential expres - sion of interacting proteins or cell - type - speciﬁc post - transla - tional modiﬁcations . Accordingly , Swiprosin - 1 was enriched in lipid rafts of two cell lines prone to BCR - induced apoptosis in contrast to apoptosis - insensitive CH27 B cells . 14 The amplifying effect of Swiprosin - 1 on BCR - induced cell death was reversed by LPS , anti CD40 and BAFF ( Figure 9 ) . LPS / TLR ( toll like receptor ) - 4 signals might counteract Swiprosin - 1 signals through sustained antiapoptotic activa - tion of NF - k B . 24 In keeping with this idea , Bcl - xL , an antiapoptotic NF - k B target gene , was upregulated in WEHI231 cells in which Swiprosin - 1 was silenced and downregulated in WEHI231 cells overexpressing Swiprosin - 1 . These ﬁndings are coherent with the notion that , like Swiprosin - 1 , Bcl - xL abundance regulates BCR - induced apoptosis , but not cell cycle arrest . 27 Since ﬁrst , Swiprosin - 1 expression is highest in immature , bone - marrow derived B cells and Bcl - xL is downregulated in immature B cells , 29 Figure 7 Effect of Swiprosin - 1 silencing and Swiprosin - 1 overexpression on p27 Kip1 , Bcl - xL and Bim expression . ( a ) Indicated WEHI231 clones were left unstimulated or stimulated with 10 m g / ml goat anti - mouse IgM F ( ab ) 2 for 24h . Cell lysates were separated by 10 % SDS - PAGE , transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with antibodies against Swiprosin - 1 , p27 Kip1 and BiP . Molecular mass standards are indicated on the left . Optical densities of p27 Kip1 bands are indicated at the bottom ( AU ) . ( b ) Cell lysates ( 80 , 27 and 9 m g ) from the indicated clones were separated by 10 % SDS - PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose . The blot was probed with antibodies against Bcl - xL , Bim , BiP and Swiprosin - 1 . Molecular mass standards are indicated on the left . ( c ) Cell lysates ( 50 , 17 and 6 m g ) from the indicated clones were separated by 10 % SDS - PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose . The blot was probed with antibodies against Bcl - xL and BiP . Molecular mass standards are indicated on the left . Relative Bcl - xL amounts were calculated by comparing Bcl - xL AU of the indicated clones , lane by lane , and are expressed as mean 7 S . D . Images are composed of different regions of the same blot Swiprosin - 1 in B - cell apoptosis and growth A Avramidou et al 1943 Cell Death and Differentiation second , Bcl - xL is important for survival of immature B cells 30 and third , NF - k B - and Bcl - xL - inducing stimuli , BAFF , anti - CD40 and LPS , counteracted Swiprosin - 1 - induced apoptosis , we propose that Swiprosin - 1 expression may contribute to survival and selection of immature B cells via modulation of Bcl - xL expression . Swiprosin - 1 could shift the balance of pro - and antiapoptotic signals in B cells towards proapoptotic signals by virtue of its abundance . Hence , Swiprosin - 1 may be involved in establishing central and peripheral tolerance by regulating the lifespan of immature B cells through induction of a default proapoptotic pathway . This could be balanced by BAFF in T2 and mature B cells , and through LPS or CD40 during T - independent or T - dependent antigenic challenges , respectively . Overexpression of Swiprosin - 1 led to reduced DC m and caspase 7 cleavage but caspases do not appear to be directly involved in BCR - induced apoptosis in WEHI231 cells . 27 Thus , the possibility that overexpression of Swiprosin - 1 activates the cytosolic phospholipase A2 ( PL A2 ) / cathepsin pathway 27 in WEHI231 cells is not excluded here . However , we exclude upregulation of proapoptotic Bim and altered Erk signaling as reasons for Swiprosin - 1 - enhanced cell death because altera - tion of Swiprosin - 1 expression did not affect Erk activation ( 0 – 60min ) or Bim expression . Instead , we observed increased I k B - a phosphorylation and degradation in pshSw1 - WEHI231 cells . Antigen - induced BCR signals stimulate the canonical NF - k B pathway , 25 mediated through the PLC g 2 / protein kinase C b ( PKC b ) / Carma - 1 cascade . 31 Since silencing of Swiprosin - 1 enhanced BCR - induced I k B - a degradation , we suggest that Swiprosin - 1 is part of the NF - k B - activating branch of the BCR pathway . Therefore , downregulation of Swiprosin - 1 in mature B cells could allow the BCR to trigger the PLC g 2 / PKC b / Carma - 1 pathway for ‘immunogenic’ signal - ing . 31 In summary , Swiprosin - 1 modulates spontaneous and BCR - induced apoptosis very likely through NF - k B , Bcl - xL , changes in DC m and activation of post - mitochondrial effector proteases . Regulation of the lifespan of immature B cells through BCR signaling thresholds has been proposed by several groups ( reviewed by Noelle and Erickson 32 ) and may be determined genetically . 33 Interestingly , the murine Swiprosin - 1 gene is localized only 10Mb away from the peak marker D4Mit33 in a murine systemic lupus erythematodes susceptibility locus on chromosome 4 . 33 An intriguing question therefore is whether Swiprosin - 1 is regulated under inﬂammatory conditions ? Indeed , Swiprosin - 1 appears to be downregulated in PBMC of human rheumatoid arthritis patients . 34 Downregulation of Swiprosin - 1 could therefore not only affect normal B - cell Figure 8 AnalysisofI k B a - andp42 / 44 - MAPKphosphorylationinSwiprosin - 1 - overexpressing and - silencedWEHI231cells .

The generation of mice with a Swiprosin - 1 - null allele will clarify this issue . Materials and Methods Antibodiesandotherreagents .
