PLs were pursued to avoid harsher restrictions , but some studies have found that the particular implementation by Madrid authorities was rather ineffective . Based on Madrid’s case , we devise a general , minimal framework to investigate the PLs effectiveness by using a data - driven metapopulation epidemiological model of a city , and explore under which circumstances the PLs could be a good NPI . The model is informed with real mobility data from Madrid to contextualize its results , but it can be generalized elsewhere . The lowest lockdown activation threshold (cid:31) considered ( 14 - day cumulative incidence rate of 20 cases per every 10 5 inhabitants ) shows a prevalence reduction > 20 % with respect to the scenario (cid:31) = 10 3 , more akin to the case of Madrid , and assuming no further mitigation . Only the combination of (cid:31) = 20 and mobility reduction > 90 % can avoid PLs for more than > 20 % of the system . The combination of low (cid:31) and strong local transmissibility reduction is key to minimize the impact , but the latter is harder to achieve given that we assume a situation with highly mitigated transmission , resembling the one observed during the second wave of COVID - 19 in Madrid . Thus , we conclude that a generalized lockdown is hard to avoid under any realistic setting if only this strategy is applied . During the COVID - 19 pandemic , we have become acquainted with a myriad of measures to halt or at least control the spreading of the novel coronavirus SARS - CoV - 2 at different scales . Measures that are different from vaccination and medical treatments are called non - pharmaceutical interventions ( NPIs ) . These may include travel bans , lockdowns of different geographical extensions , curfews , restrictions on occupancy in public closed spaces , or self - protection measures such as wearing masks or sanitation ( see 1 for a comprehensive review of NPIs within the context of COVID - 19 ) 2 – 6 . The objective of most NPIs is to reduce contacts between individuals , with the ultimate goal of breaking transmission chains and , subsequently , controlling the spread and minimizing hospitalizations and deaths . However , certain NPIs may bring severe economic downturns 7 – 9 , dysfunctional supply chains 10 – 12 , and social backlash 13 – 15 . Therefore , competent authorities should be properly informed of the benefits and costs of the possible interventions , especially if these are enforced . Given the negative impact that global lockdowns and quarantines inflict on societies , it is important to look for alternative strategies in successive COVID - 19 waves . In this regard , a proposed alternative in the context of urban settlements is that of localized mobility restrictions , which is a more fine - grained restriction that acts only on the neighborhoods that are especially affected by an epidemic outbreak , instead of acting indiscriminately on the whole city . In Spain , the city of Madrid stands as a unique and paradigmatic example of pursuing the so - called perimeter lockdowns ( PLs ) at the level of Basic Health Zones ( BHZ , subareas of the city defined by public health criteria ) . The main characteristic of these lockdowns was that they were implemented in highly inte - grated urban areas . As such , they restricted mobility in and out of the BHZ but allowed residents to go to work , attend academic activities , or for other essential purposes in the rest of the city , for which public transportation was available . Similarly , small businesses such as restaurants and shops were allowed to open , although at 50 % maximum capacity . Hence , the lockdown was much more permeable than those implemented at larger scales , in which mobility is completely restricted between cities or regions . The case of Madrid reached the literature OPEN 1 Institute for Biocomputation and Physics of Complex Systems ( BIFI ) , University of Zaragoza , 50018 Zaragoza , Spain . 2 Department of Theoretical Physics , University of Zaragoza , 50018 Zaragoza , Spain . 3 Centai , Turin , Italy . * email : alfonso . demiguel . arribas @ gmail . com 2 Vol : .

But the commentary received several responses that pointed to inaccuracies and lack of self - criticism given the severe impact of the epidemic in the region 17 – 20 . Two different studies approached the question through statistical analyses and con - cluded its lack of effectiveness at least in the real - life setting under consideration 21 , 22 . Independently , perimeter lockdowns within a large city were also implemented during the first wave of COVID - 19 in Santiago de Chile . In 23 , the authors similarly conclude , through causal inference methods , that this kind of strategy is ineffective in the context of highly integrated human settlements , such as cities . Due to the rarity of this strategy , to the best of our knowledge , it has not been explored using mechanistic models . In contrast to studies that rely on the statistical analysis of the collected data , mechanistic models can provide important insights into the effects of any strategy regardless of the peculiarities of the situation under analysis . This is important to properly gauge if a strategy will be effective in other places and under different conditions . Thus , in this work , we aim to assess the effectiveness of PLs at the urban scale using these models . To do so , we first take a brief look at the data collected during the implementation of the strategy in Madrid . This case serves as an example of how this strategy can be implemented in practice . Then , we build a simplified model of COVID - 19 transmission to test the effect of PLs at the urban scale using a metapopulation framework . It is worth stressing that , even though we use the case of Madrid as an inspiration to conceive and guide the study , the framework developed is general enough to be extended to other locations . As such , we do not intend to replicate Madrid’s epidemiological trajectory but rather design , based on epidemiological first principles , a minimal model that captures the essential features of the spreading at the urban level and that can inform public health policy on the outcome of potential scenarios . Results First , we take a brief look at the real data from Madrid during the period in which the PL strategy was in place . Then , we show the results from the simulations of our metapopulation model with PLs applied to an idealized scenario inspired by Madrid . Analysis of Madrid’s epidemiological data . In general , perimeter lockdowns were enforced in areas in which the 14 - day cumulative incidence rate ( 14d CIR ) was above a certain threshold , although this information could be complemented by its trend and the , broadly defined , presence of community transmission in the area . In Fig . 1 , the dashed horizontal lines indicate the threshold set by the authorities which , as we can see , was not static . Rather , it mostly followed the epidemic waves . This strategy was in place from late September 2020 to May 2021 ( vertical dashed lines in the figure ) , a period that comprises the second and third waves of the epidemic in Spain ( the first one is not shown in the figures ) . Given the typical time scale of the spreading , it has been shown that the change in trend after the implementation of the strategy cannot be attributed to it 21 , 22 . Note also that there were several BHZs with a 14d CIR above the threshold that were not confined ( Fig . 1B ) . Lastly , we observe high synchronization in the spreading for all the BHZ time series , whether under lockdown or not . Thus , either the application of the strategy in a few areas had effects on the whole system , or it had limited consequences . Next , we look at the overall mobility from the beginning of the pandemic to the end of the PL strategy , F . g . 2 . The imposition of the national lockdown ( first vertical red line ) reduced mobility to 40 % of the usual values . Then , it slowly increased following the progressive lifting of the restrictions during the summer of 2020 , reaching mobility values of 70 % of the baseline . The value is reduced once again to 50 % of the baseline mobility during August 2020 , which is the period in which , typically , people go on vacation in Spain .

In this period , we observe that the mobility levels tend to stabilize , except for the occasional public holidays , around that 70 % . Averaging over the full period of PLs , mobility levels remain at 0 . 63 [ 0 . 62 , 0 . 64 ] , and , excluding weekends , increase to 0 . 67 [ 0 . 66 , 0 . 68 ] . Thus , the impact of the PLs on the overall mobility within the city was negligible . Modeling perimeter lockdowns . We use a stochastic and discrete - time metapopulation SIR model ( see “Methods” ) . In this context , a metapopulation is a collection of subpopulations that can exchange individuals . Inside each population , the dynamics of the disease are governed by the classical SIR model . Thus , an individual may get infected in one subpopulation , travel to another one and start a new outbreak there . These models have been applied to global - scale situations , such as the global spread of influenza - like diseases 24 , 25 , COVID - 19 26 – 28 , and to regional and national scales 29 , 30 . The metapopulation framework 31 , 32 is versatile and allows the description of a system on varying spatial scales , and thus can also be conceived on the urban scale . Our analysis considers an urban system with a total population of N individuals and V administrative subdivisions ( subpopulations ) . The epidemic dynamics within each district i is governed by a well - mixed SIR compartmental model where the probability of getting infected is 1 − [ 1 − R 0 � t / ( T I N i ) ] I i , where N i represents the number of people in district i , I i is the number of infected individuals in the said area , R 0 is the basic reproduction number and T I is the mean infectious time . The flow between districts in the metapopulation system is modeled through a static origin - destination matrix . The matrix was built using real mobility data from the pre - pandemic period ( see “Methods” ) . We modu - late the intensity of the flow with a global parameter , κ , so that if κ → 0 individuals do not exit their district . Conversely , if κ → 1 , the mobility is equal to the baseline situation ( see Eq . 2 ) . We further assume a situation of general disease awareness in society and thus with generalized mitigation measures in place like wearing face masks , extra hygiene measures , some capacity limits , avoidance of crowded situations , etc . This awareness situation is more similar to the one experienced in Madrid at the time of the onset of the perimeter lockdown strategy . In this context , it would be more appropriate to model the spreading using the effective reproductive number R t rather than the basic reproductive number R 0 , the latter being defined only for a fully susceptible population without any mitigation strategies in place . For simplicity , we set R 0 ≈ R t to include directly all these factors without explicitly modeling them 33 . We set R 0 = 1 . 25 which is in the range of the estimations of the effective reproduction number performed by the Spanish Ministry of Health in August 2020 , when the second wave of infections started 34 . Finally , we use an infectious period of T I = 4 . 5 days . All simulations are seeded with 5 infected individuals in the central district Centro . The simulations end when the total number of infected individuals in the system reaches zero . We add two extra parameters to the model to reproduce the dynamics of the perimeter lockdowns ( PLs ) : (cid:31) and χ . The first one is the risk threshold that determines when an area should be closed . Even though this parameter changed many times during the implementation of this strategy in Madrid ( see Fig . 1 ) , we fix it for each simulation . This way , whenever the cumulative incidence in a district i is above (cid:31) , a PL is activated in that area . As a consequence , flows of travelers from and to the district at risk are completely suppressed . The second parameter , χ , is the transmissibility reduction fraction in district i , so that β i = χβ , where β is the general trans - missibility rate related to the basic reproductive number of the disease , R 0 = β T I . As previously discussed , PLs included other control measures aimed at reducing the spreading rate within the affected area , and this parameter allows us to control the intensity of such interventions . To study the effect of PLs , we define three epidemiological observables : global peak incidence , I max , global final prevalence , R ( ∞ ) , and the final fraction of districts whose 14d CIR exceeded a certain risk threshold , D ( ∞ ) / V . For brevity , we refer to these observables simply as the peak incidence , prevalence , and locked dis - tricts , respectively . Furthermore , in all cases the values are normalized over the ones obtained in the no - response M a r 20 A p r 20 M a y 20 J un 20 J u l 20 A ug 20 S e p 20 O c t 20 N ov 20 D ec 20 J a n 21 F e b 21 M a r 21 A p r 21 M a y 21 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 N o r m a li ze d nu m b e r o f t r a v e l s National lockdown 2020 / 9 / 21 PLsstart 2021 / 5 / 21 PLs end WeekdaysSatSun Figure 2 .

Weekend days are distinguished for the sake of clarity . There was a national lockdown from March 2020 to June 2020 , corresponding to the first wave of the epidemic in Spain . The PL strategy was implemented in Madrid on late September 2020 . Note that the Spanish Government stopped collecting mobility data two weeks before the end of the PL strategy in Madrid . 4 Vol : .

As such , when the normalized observables are less than unity , it signals that the intervention had some positive effect on containing the epi - demic . In the following , we explore how these observables change when we vary the three free parameters in our model : the general mobility parameter , κ , the risk threshold , (cid:31) , and the transmissibility reduction , χ . Effects of perimeter lockdowns . Panels A1 ( peak incidence ) , A2 ( prevalence ) , and A3 ( locked districts ) of Fig . 3 show a series of curves for several threshold risk values (cid:31) = 20 , 100 , 500 , and 1000 , without transmis - sibility reduction in locked areas ( χ = 1 ) and varying κ as control parameter . Every point in the curves depicts a situation where mobility is lower than the baseline scenario ( κ = 1 ) . Note that , since χ = 1 , the only effect of PLs is to cut down mobility in and out the affected districts . These curves then allow us to disentangle the effects of general mobility on the system . Clearly , all the observables show that reducing the general mobility parameter κ helps to reduce the impact of the epidemic with respect to the no - response scenario . The problem , though , lies in the magnitude of the decrease . Madrid’s PLs pursued risk threshold values mainly between (cid:31) = 500 and 1000 most of the time . Under these conditions , even with lower mobility than the one observed during the national lockdown ( κ ∼ 0 . 4 , see Fig . 2 ) the effects are mostly negligible . To achieve , for instance , a reduction of 20 % in peak incidence , mobility should be one order of magnitude lower than during the national lockdown ( κ ∼ 0 . 01 ) . And this still would not impact the prevalence or the fraction of locked districts . Only when κ = 10 − 3 ( 99 . 9 % reduction ) , these quantities are reduced by 50 % . With a much more strict threshold for PL activation , (cid:31) = 20 , and under the regular mobility scenario , we can obtain a reduction in peak incidence > 20 % , and around 10 % in prevalence , but this does not keep the system from undergoing a de facto general lockdown unless mobility is also reduced by 90 % or more . In panels B1 ( peak incidence ) , B2 ( prevalence ) , B2 ( locked districts ) of Fig . 3 , instead , we fix the general mobility to the baseline , κ = 1 , and vary χ in the districts under PLs . In this situation , the intervention restricts the in and out mobility in the selected districts and also reduces the transmissibility within the area by a factor χ . Here we readily see that PLs , when accompanied with additional mitigation measures inside the affected area , can effectively reduce the impact of the disease on the system . Given the proposed R 0 = 1 . 25 and T I = 4 . 5 days , reducing baseline transmissibility by 20 % ( χ = 0 . 8 ) translates into an effective reproduction number for a quarantined district that is on the verge of criticality , that is , R ∗ = 1 31 . Note , however , that the value of R 0 is already very low as we assume that multiple non - pharmaceutical interventions are in place . Thus , achieving further reductions might not be possible . In any case , when χ = 0 . 8 and (cid:31) = 500 , we obtain normalized values for peak incidence of 0 . 093 [ 0 . 093 , 0 . 093 ] and prevalence of 0 . 166 [ 0 . 166 , 0 . 167 ] . This is a reduction of more than 90 % and 80 % with respect to the no - response scenario , respectively . However , we can see that all districts in the urban system have outbreaks above the risk threshold , for any (cid:31) and χ shown in the figure . Thus , under these conditions , perimeter lockdowns can greatly reduce the impact on the population but would not protect parts of the city from the most affected ones , even under mild epidemiological conditions . Figure 3 . Epidemic impact curves for varying control parameter values . ( A1 ) , ( A2 ) , and ( A3 ) show the peak incidence , prevalence , and locked districts fraction , respectively , for varying values of mobility parameter κ and different threshold (cid:31) values , without transmissibility reductions in the locked areas ( χ = 1 ) . ( B1 ) , ( B2 ) , and ( B3 ) show the same observables for varying values of transmissibility reduction , χ , and different (cid:31) values , with baseline mobility ( κ = 1 ) . Quantity values are normalized with respect to a no - response scenario . The vertical dashed line in the B panels marks the point where , by reducing χ , the global reproduction number turns R ∗ = 1 , and thus the threshold under which the spread is under control 31 . 5 Vol . : ( 0123456789 ) Scientific Reports | ( 2023 ) 13 : 4474 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41598 - 023 - 31614 - 8 www . nature . com / scientificreports / Lastly , we explore in more detail the space of parameters ( κ , χ ) for two selected (cid:31) scenarios . We consider a rather proactive strategy , with (cid:31) = 20 ( panels A1 , A2 , A3 in Fig . 4 ) , and a more reactive strategy , with (cid:31) = 500 ( panels B1 , B2 , B3 in Fig . 4 ) . With this analysis , we can better appreciate the limited role of general mobility κ in both the reduction of the peak incidence and the final global prevalence when κ decreases from unity down to sensible but really strict values ( around κ = 0 . 1 ) . Now , moving from χ = 1 to χ = 0 . 8 we can obtain an impor - tant reduction of the impact , both for (cid:31) = 20 and also (cid:31) = 500 . See Tables 1 and 2 for an outline of the results given a selection of ( κ , χ ) scenarios . Finally , with respect to locked districts , with (cid:31) = 20 it is possible to avoid the invasion of the entire system , but it requires a strong reduction of mobility , going well below κ = 0 . 5 ( see Table 1 ) . Note the difficulty of doing this : PLs have to be activated very soon and , at the same time , it is essential to achieve a strong reduction of global mobility in the system to effectively save a few districts from experienc - ing an outbreak . With (cid:31) = 500 , the full invasion is unavoidable , except for extremely low values of mobility . Discussion Examples of perimeter lockdowns of highly dense - integrated suburban areas are scarce . The inspection of the real epidemiological and mobility data from Madrid casts a lot of doubts about its proper implementation and its effectiveness . As we referenced previously , this is something that the few works devoted to the experience Figure 4 . Epidemic impact when varying simultaneously κ and χ for selected (cid:31) scenarios . Plots ( A1 ) , ( A2 ) , and ( A3 ) show the peak incidence , prevalence , and locked districts fraction , respectively , in ( χ , κ ) - space for the threshold (cid:31) = 20 .

In 21 , through a joint point trend analysis , the authors found that the decrease in the epidemic curve , both in the entire city and the BHZ affected , started before the impact of the perimeter lockdown could have been reflected , and also found that the strategy did not increase the speed at which cases were decreasing . The authors offer several reasons for the strategy’s failure : ( 1 ) the curve started to decrease before measures were taken . ( 2 ) Perimeter lockdowns were focused on mobility rather than preventing high - risk situations . ( 3 ) Even though the focus lied on mobility , it was allowed for essential activities such as working . And ( 4 ) , BHZ boundaries were unknown to many residents since these are used for public healthcare administration . Regarding our particular experiment , points ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) apply and align well with our conclu - sions : mobility is not very much effective in this kind of setting , and the focus should be on preventing high - risk situations like workplace or community mixing . In 22 , through the use of a generalized additive models technique , they reach a similar conclusion : the perimeter confinements did not have a significant impact on the 14 - day cumulative incidence . To further understand the mechanisms underpinning the spreading dynamics in this strategy , we conceived a minimal model using a metapopulation framework parameterized using real mobility data . Our model results show how difficult it is to control an outbreak in an urban environment under the PLs . The reduction is critically marked by how successful the transmissibility reduction is within a district , with mobility playing a minor role . Note that Madrid initially set its lockdown risk threshold at (cid:31) = 1000 and then changed it dynamically up and down , being (cid:31) = 350 the lowest documented . In our model , even when the threshold was (cid:31) = 20 , a very high effort on reducing general mobility was needed to avoid invasion of the full system . This mobility reduction was not even achieved during the national lockdown that closed most businesses and industries ( Fig . 2 ) . Furthermore , during a PL in Madrid , it was still allowed to go to your workplace even if it was in another district . Localized lockdowns were also implemented in Santiago de Chile during its first COVID - 19 wave . In 23 , Li et al . explored their performance , obtaining mixed results . The authors state that localized lockdowns on their own are insufficient to control pandemic growth in the presence of indirect effects from contiguous neighboring areas that do not have lockdowns . As we did , they found that localized lockdowns can help contain the transmis - sion of the virus but their effectiveness is dependent on its duration and indirect effects from neighboring areas Table 1 .

Moreover , their estimates showed that in Greater Santiago the epidemic is only controlled when generalized lockdowns are in place . In contrast , these measures showed promising results in municipalities that were rather isolated from affected neighboring areas . They concluded that the growth of disease transmission is reversed only when lockdowns are implemented in a coordinated fashion across inter - connected geographic areas . Urban systems for the most part are typically very well interconnected systems where it is easy to move from one part to another in time scales significantly lower than 1 day . Large portions of the population in these systems mix at different sites during the day : whether at workplaces , at schools , at the public transportation system , or during leisure activities . Therefore , a high level of synchronization in the spreading can be expected . Hence , when an outbreak emerges in one area , it will quickly spread through the system unless mobility is extremely reduced . If perimeter lockdowns are accompanied by significant transmissibility reductions , the measures can make a difference to flatten the curves . But unless the action is performed soon enough , the most probable course of action for the spreading is to quickly invade the full system . If the goal of the PLs is to protect some parts of the system so that citizens inside can normally live and perform their daily activities , this seems unachievable under reasonable assumptions and regular behavior . Our results from a sound theoretical model which idealized several critical features and thus , overall , offered a best - case scenario , seem to confirm this thesis . Moreover , the real epidemiological data for Madrid clearly shows the synchronization phenomena among different areas . Responses that aim to partially isolate areas of a system that are so spatially interconnected and temporally synchronized are likely to be insufficient . As results have shown , the emphasis should not be on mobility ( either general or among particular areas ) but on general measures that bring transmission down where the mixing or contact is effectively produced . Our model explains the qualitative features of the real epidemic spreading observed in Madrid under the PLs and sets a general model to approach this type of situation . Nonetheless , it has its limitations . As we have already stated , our model is minimal and is intended to capture only the most basic features of the spreading together with the control strategy , but it is not intended to reproduce the real COVID - 19 trajectories that took place during the period studied . COVID - 19 is a complex disease with a long latency period , an important amount of pre - symptomatic infectivity and even asymptomatic transmission . Moreover , the disease can present high hospitalization and death rates which are highly age - dependent . These are elements worth taking into account when aiming for accurate COVID - 19 forecasting . However , regarding the assessment of non - pharmaceutical interventions as the one presented here , the SIR model stands as a simple but best - case scenario modeling choice . The rationale is that even though we neglect key elements that would hinder surveillance and disease control , such as a latency period and asymptomatic disease progression , the outcome is still unfavorable for the success of the strategy . Another limitation is that , at the subpopulation level , a homogeneous well - mixing scheme is con - sidered . This is a standard assumption within the metapopulation framework but indeed relevant heterogeneous features may exist both intra - district and inter - district , such as age differential mixing . We also remark that our implementation of PLs assumed perfect information and absolute compliance . Moreover , travel bans were totally cut down , which is at odds with the permeability allowed in the real - life setting . Thus , even though our model is limited in many aspects , it can be , in general , regarded as a best - case scenario . The fact that the PLs did not achieve high effectiveness under these circumstances signals that in a real setting the situation would be worse . Even though our minimal model indicates that the effectiveness of perimeter lockdowns at the urban scale is low , more detailed modeling could unveil subtleties at lower scales . Future works could aim for increased heterogeneity in human behavior . One could use micro - mobility models based on points of interests at the subpopulation level to break the homogeneous mixing assumption . In terms of the population , the addition of the socioeconomic characteristics of the population may help to disentangle the differential impact of non - pharmaceutical strategies on the diverse population strata . Indeed , even though at the aggregated level perimeter lockdowns appear to be inefficient , their impact on the most vulnerable parts of the population is yet unknown and is open for further research . From a theoretical point of view , an interesting research line would be to determine the amount of spatial cohesion at which these systems tend to be highly synchronized and for which mobility plays only a minor role beyond the initial stages . This could facilitate the analysis of strategies similar to the one presented here at multiple scales , such as metropolitan areas or urban - rural systems . Methods Madrid’s surveillance data . To test the effectiveness of the measures in the particular case of Madrid , we have explored the official epidemiological data reported by the government 35 and collected the time series for the 14 - day cumulative incidence rate ( 14d CIR ) for all the BHZs belonging to the city of Madrid . The 14d CIR is a standard in the field of public health 36 and is measured as : where N is the total population assuming a fully susceptible population at the beginning of the outbreak , and the summation of new cases is done over the previous 14 days . The value is given for every 100 , 000 inhabitants . Therefore , for the sake of brevity , all references to this variable will omit this factor . In Madrid , this indicator was used to determine whether or not a particular BHZ had to be confined , together with other auxiliary information such as its trend or the presence of community transmission . The threshold value upon which a PL was implemented varied in time . Consequently , for a more complete picture , we also reconstructed the 14d CIR threshold , or activation threshold , by looking at official bulletins 37 . The confined status of a BHZ was held for two weeks and then reviewed according to its epidemiological situation . ( 1 ) 14d CIR = (cid:31) 14i = 1 new cases i N × 10 5 inhabitants , 8 Vol : .

The metapopulation framework is a versatile way of modeling the spreading of an epidemic in which the spatial distribution of individuals plays a major role 31 , 32 . In particular , we create a metapopulation system composed of 21 subpopulations representing each of the 21 administrative districts of the city of Madrid , Spain . Within each subpopulation , the epidemic dynamics are governed by the classical SIR model under the well - mixed approximation . It must be noted that , even though this model cannot capture some of the particular characteristics of COVID - 19 , it can still provide useful insights for settings in which those characteristics do not play a major role , as in our analysis 33 , 38 . In cases in which case detection or the latency period might be relevant , it would be necessary to use an SEIR model or one of its vari - ants . Epidemic modeling . At the district level , we implement a well - mixed SIR compartmental model . In this model , individuals are classified according to their health status : susceptible ( S ) if they are susceptible to catching the disease , infected ( I ) if they have been infected and can infect others , and removed ( R ) when they are either recov - ered or deceased . Within each district , the transition between compartments results from the following rules , iterated at each time step , corresponding to (cid:31) t = 1 day 39 : • S → I : Susceptible individuals in district i are infected with probability P i ( S → I ) = 1 − [ 1 − R 0 � t / ( T I N i ) ] I i , where R 0 is the basic reproduction number of the disease , T I is the mean infectious time , N i represents the number of people in district i and I i represents the number of infected individuals in the said area . • I → R : Infected individuals become removed at a rate inversely proportional to the mean infectious period , T I . The probability for an infected individual to transition to the removed state is thus simply P ( I → R ) = � t / T I . The new infected and removed individuals are generated stochastically by sampling from binomial distributions using the above probabilities , respectively 39 , 40 . Mobility . To estimate realistic mobility patterns we use the data from a mobility survey carried out by the Spanish Ministry of Transport , Mobility and Urban Agenda 41 . This survey provides the estimated number of individuals going from one district to another every day since February 2020 to May 2021 . We use the data from the pre - pandemic period to build a baseline mobility matrix that is not influenced by any changes on social interactions produced by the pandemic . Indeed , as described in the main text , we use an effective value of the basic reproduction number that already incorporates all these effects . Thus , if we were to use the real data from the period under study , we would be counting twice certain interventions . Each element of the mobility matrix , D ij , represents the rate at which individuals move from district i to district j . This can be estimated from the origin - destination ( OD ) matrix provided by the Spanish government , M , in which M ij represents the number of individuals traveling from district i to district j . In particular , the ele - ments of D are defined as : where D ij is the rate at which individuals move from district i to district j and κ is a general mobility parameter . The baseline values of D ij are obtained considering κ = 1 . When κ → 0 , we see that D ii → 1 , so that the rate of individuals staying at their origin district approaches one . The particular values of D ij are calculated using data from the Ministry’s survey from the pre - pandemic period . Then , at each step (cid:31) t , the number of travelers from district i to every destination j is sampled from a multinomial process with probabilities D ij (cid:31) t . Perimeter lockdown strategy . The response against the spreading process is assumed to be the best - case sce - nario , with perfect information and neither exceptions nor violations of the policies enacted by the authorities . The observable to monitor the effectiveness in every district is the same as in the real - life setting , the 14d CIR . We set a risk threshold (cid:31) so that whenever 14d CIR i ≥ (cid:31) for district i , we say that this district is at risk and thus it is set under a perimeter lockdown . The implications for a district under this type of lockdown are twofold : 1 . Travel bans . Flows of travelers from and to the district at risk are completely suppressed . Note that this intervention is independent of the value of κ , which controls the overall mobility in the system even in the absence of restrictions . It is also important to remark that this is again a best - case scenario since in reality trips involving affected areas were allowed for a variety of circumstances . 2 . Transmissibility reduction . Localized lockdowns usually come with additional measures to try to control the spreading within the affected area . This may include a rise in disease awareness through mass media and authorities’ advertisements and actions like occupancy limits and mandatory wearing of face masks . The combination of such actions would translate into a reduction of the transmissibility , its magnitude being dependent on people’s compliance and the intensity and effectiveness of those same measures . To model this , we set a local transmissibility rate for each closed district i , β i = χβ , where β is the general transmissibility rate related to the basic reproductive number of the disease R 0 = β T I , and χ is the fraction of the reduction in transmissibility . For normal districts , χ = 1 , but when a district is under lockdown , this quantity is χ < 1 . ( 2 ) D ij = (cid:31) κ M ij (cid:30) j M ij if i � = j 1 − (cid:30) k � = i D ik if i = j 9 Vol . : ( 0123456789 ) Scientific Reports | ( 2023 ) 13 : 4474 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41598 - 023 - 31614 - 8 www . nature . com / scientificreports / Once these measures are in place for a district at risk , the restriction remains until the outbreak ends in the whole system . That is , when the global incidence is I = 0 . In reality , however , once the affected areas stopped fulfilling the lockdown requirements , these restrictions were lifted . Since we are not seeking a replication of the Madrid epidemiological trajectory , but a general exploration and understanding of the basic dynamics under these types of lockdowns , we limit ourselves to studying what happens in this extreme scenario . Population and mobility data . The metapopulation model is informed by real population and mobility data from Madrid . Madrid is the capital city of Spain with a population of N = 3 , 312 , 310 inhabitants in 2020 . The prime administrative divisions of the city are V = 21 distritos ( districts ) . The model does not resolve at the basic health zone ( BHZ ) level , which is the one that was actually considered for the PLs , due to the lack of more fine - grained mobility data . In Table 3 , we collect the population size at the district level N i ( note that a BHZ generally encompasses between 5000 and 25 , 000 inhabitants ) . Regarding mobility data , we obtained interdistrict mobility flows provided by the Spanish Ministry of Transport as part of a survey aimed at analyzing changes in mobility patterns within Spain amid the COVID - 19 crisis and at evaluating the effect of mobility restrictions 41 . This survey is based on cell phone data provided by cell phone carriers . The data of interest spans a period ranging from March 2020 until May 2021 . There is also a week of data in February 2020 , from day 14 to day 21 , used as a baseline reference for comparisons with the COVID - 19 period . We refer to this period as the regular mobility scenario . We took only this reference period since we want to inform our urban model of Madrid with regular or unperturbed data . These data are used to build the origin - destination matrix M . To do so , we average the mobility flows between i and j for the whole week so that M is time - independent . Data availability The epidemiological data is publicly available at 35 . The raw mobility data is publicly available at 41 .
