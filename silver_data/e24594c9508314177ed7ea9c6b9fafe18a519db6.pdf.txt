Summary . The formation of actin ﬁlaments is crucial for endocytosis and other interrelated cellular phenomena such as motility , polarized morpho - genesis , and cytokinesis . In this paper we have investigated the role of the WASP / Las17 - interacting protein Bzz1p in endocytosis and trafﬁcking to the vacuole . We and others have recently shown that Bzz1p is an actin patch protein that interacts directly with Las17p via a SH3 - polyproline in - teraction . Bzz1p functions with type I myosins to restore polarity of the actin cytoskeleton after NaCl stress . In an in vitro bead assay , GST - Bzz1p fusion protein triggers a functional actin polymerization machinery through its two C - terminal SH3 domains . In this paper we implicate Bzz1p with the type I myosins both in ﬂuid - phase and in the internalization step of recep - tor - mediated endocytosis . As deduced from their localization as GFP fu - sions , the vacuolar delivery of endocytic and biosynthetic cargoes as well as the multivesicular body pathway appear unaffected . We further elucidate Bzz1p direct participation in actin polymerization by demonstrating that each of the SH3 domains of Bzz1p individually is able to trigger actin poly - merization in a cell - free system dependent on Arp2 / 3 , Las17p , Vrp1p , and the type I myosins . Taken together , our results show that Bzz1p partici - pates , essentially via its SH3 domains , in early steps of endocytosis to - gether with known actin nucleation activators .

Introduction The formation of actin ﬁlaments is crucial for multiple , in - terrelated cellular phenomena such as motility , endocytosis , polarized morphogenesis , and cytokinesis . Three types of actin ﬁlament structures compose the yeast actin cytoskele - ton : cortical patches at the plasma membrane , cytoplasmic cables oriented along the mother – daughter cell axis , and an actomyosin ring which forms at cytokinesis ( Kilmartin and Adams 1984 , Tolliday et al . 2001 ) . While nucleation of actin structures in cables and cytokinesis ring depends on the formin proteins Bni1p and Bnr1p ( Evangelista et al . 2002 , Pruyne et al . 2002 , Sagot et al . 2002 ) , actin nucle - ation in cortical patches requires the conserved protein complex Arp2 / 3 . This complex , which is involved in actin dynamics , endocytosis , and polarized growth , functions downstream of the Rho - type GTPases Cdc42 and Rac in mammalian cells and of Cdc42p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( Higgs and Pollard 2001 ) . Major regulators of Arp2 / 3 complex - dependent actin polymerization are the proteins of the WASP ( Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome pro - tein ) / SCAR ( suppressor of cyclic AMP receptor ) , or WAVE , family . These proteins are adapters that integrate cellular signals through interaction with multiple effectors , such as activated Rho GTPases , phosphoinositides , or SH3 ( Src homology 3 ) domain proteins , to activate and regulate the nucleation of actin polymerization by the Arp2 / 3 com - plex ( Rohatgi et al . 2001 ) . In S . cerevisiae , the unique WASP homologue Las17p ( local anaesthetic sensitive , also called Bee1p ) , is dependent on the GTPase Cdc42 for its function ( Lechler et al . 2001 ) . Las17p is involved in actin assembly at the cell cortex and in endocytosis and was shown to be a potent activator of actin polymerization in vitro ( Li 1997 , Madania et al . 1999 , Naqvi et al . 1998 ) . A number of other proteins that function with Las17p and localize to cortical patches in S . cerevisiae are important for endocytosis , notably verprolin ( Vrp1p ) and the redundant type I myosins Myo3p and Myo5p ( Evangelista et al . 2000 , Geli et al . 2000 , Madania et al . 1999 , Naqvi et al . 1998 ) .

Deletion of Vrp1p , the yeast homologue for mammalian WIP ( WASP - interacting protein ) leads to defects in growth , endo - cytosis , and actin patch polarization ( Naqvi et al . 1998 ) . Vrp1p contains a WH2 domain similar to the one in the C - terminal region of Las17p , which allows interaction with monomeric actin . Although Vrp1p has not been reported to activate nucleation , functional and direct physical interac - tions with Las17p have been demonstrated and both proteins are components of a macromolecular complex at potential sites of Cdc42p - dependent cortical actin polymerization ( Lechler et al . 2001 , Madania et al . 1999 ) . Genetic analysis has demonstrated that type I myosins are functionally redun - dant with WASP counterparts in fungi ( S . cerevisiae Las17p and Schizosaccharomyces pombe Wsp1p ) and both Dictyostelium discoideum and fungal type I myosins physi - cally interact with the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Jung et al . 2001 , Lee et al . 2000 , Soldati 2003 ) . In S . cerevisiae , Myo3p and Myo5p are required for actin assembly in a permeabilized cell assay and participate in activation of Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin poly - merization at the plasma membrane , in endocytosis , and in actin polarization . Both proteins interact with Las17p and Vrp1p through SH3 / polyproline binding and Myo5p SH3 domain recruits the actin polymerization machinery in vitro in a Vrp1p - dependent manner ( Evangelista et al . 2000 , Geli et al . 2000 , Lechler et al . 2000 ) . A model was proposed in which Las17p , Vrp1p , and Myo3 / 5p form a complex con - taining two redundant activators of the Arp2 / 3 complex : Las17p as one element and Vrp1p in association with type I myosins as another ( Lechler et al . 2001 ) . Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin polymerization at the plasma membrane is important for the internalization step of endocy - tosis ( Kubler and Riezman 1993 , Moreau et al . 1997 ) . In S . cerevisiae , the analysis of endocytosis in several endocyto - sis - deﬁcient mutants ( end mutants ) reveals a requirement for actin and for a number of other proteins that affect actin dynamics ( Munn et al . 1995 ) . Thus , although the general evidence for the implication of the actin cytosketon in endo - cytosis was abundant , direct evidence comes from recent dy - namic studies in vivo ( Gourlay et al . 2003 , Kaksonen et al . 2003 , Smith et al . 2001 ) . The recent study by Kaksonen et al . ( 2003 ) has shown that actin patches display a slow - move - ment phase followed by a fast - movement phase away from the plasma membrane , which the authors suggest may corre - spond to the formation of a membrane invagination followed by the departure of an endocytic vesicle into the cytoplasm . In mammalian cells , the formation of individual clathrin - coated pits correlates with the recruitment of dynamin and actin . Actin was recruited at late stages of pit formation and its polymerization corresponds to the movement of newly formed vesicle into the cell ( Merriﬁeld et al . 2002 ) . In S . cerevisiae , a recent dynamic localization of Myo5 - GFP shows that it associates with cortical patches without detectable oscillation or movement and this precedes the fast movement of Arp2 / 3 - associated structures away from the plasma membrane . A temperature - sensitive myo5 mutant which retards this fast - movement phase is also defective for ﬂuid - phase endocytosis , suggesting that type I myosins facilitate either the membrane constriction or the vesicle scission phase of endocytosis ( Jonsdottir and Li 2004 ) . This result is in agreement with other studies showing that class I myosins are implicated in closure of mammalian phago - somes ( Swanson et al . 1999 ) and are transiently localized to sites of macropinocytosis and phagocytosis in Acanth - amoeba castellanii ( Ostap et al . 2003 ) . Endocytosed molecules are delivered to early endosomes for sorting and their subsequent transport along the endocytic pathway results in delivery to the vacuolar or lysosomal lu - men , where they are degraded . A study in living S . cerevisiae cells with the endocytic marker Ste2 - GFP showed that the motility of endosomes and delivery of endocytosed cargoes to the vacuole requires actin polymerization dependent on Las17p ( Chang et al . 2003 ) . Newly synthesized proteins intersect the endocytic pathway at the endosome , a major sorting station for retrograde and forward trafﬁc . Two main pathways ensure trafﬁcking from the Golgi to the vacuole , the CPY ( caboxypeptidase Y ) pathway that is dependent on a large number of Vps ( vacuolar sorting proteins ) proteins and the ALP ( alkaline phosphatase ) pathway that requires the AP - 3 adaptor complex ( Lemmon and Traub 2000 ) . Mem - brane proteins require a speciﬁc sorting at the endosomal level for their delivery to the vacuolar lumen . These proteins coming either from the biosynthetic or the endocytic path - way are sorted into the intralumenal vesicles of the late endo - somes or multivesicular bodies ( MVB ) ( Raiborg et al . 2003 ) . We have recently shown that two yeast ENTH ( epsin N - terminal homology ) domain - containing proteins , Ent3p and Ent5p , which are involved in sorting of ubiquitinated biosyn - thetic and endocytic cargoes into the MVB , are required for polarized organization of the actin cytoskeleton ( Eugster et al . 2004 , Friant et al . 2003 ) . Moreover , Vps52p , a member of the yeast tethering complex ( or GARP , Golgi associated retrograde protein complex ) , was originally isolated as a sup - pressor of actin mutants ( Conibear and Stevens 2000 , Winsor and Schiebel 1997 ) . A recent screen to identify new vps mu - tants in S . cerevisiae showed that a number of these mutants have defects in their actin cytoskeleton organization or affect actin - related proteins ( Bonangelino et al . 2002 ) . Further - more , in a Xenopus laevis cell - free system , the Arp2 / 3 com - plex has been shown to mediate propulsion of endosomes through the cytoplasm and N - WASP localizes to the front of 90 A . Soulard et al . : Yeast protein Bzz1p functions with Myo5p in endocytosis actin comet tails formed on these endomembranes in vivo and in vitro ( Taunton et al . 2000 ) . The conserved protein domain SH3 is a protein – protein interaction module that binds speciﬁcally to short proline - rich sequences ( Mayer 2001 ) . The majority of SH3 do - main - containing proteins is involved in signalling pathways and in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton , even though these proteins also participate in numerous other processes . The S . cerevisiae genome contains 29 SH3 domains in 25 proteins , a number of which are known to be part of or to interact with the actin cytoskeleton . As indicated above , the SH3 domain of type I myosins is fundamental in actin cy - toskeleton regulation . Several other yeast proteins impli - cated in actin regulation ( Rvs167p , Lsb1 - 4p , Bzz1p , Bbc1 , and Sla1p ) bear SH3 domains that interact directly with the proline - rich region of Las17p ( Madania et al . 1999 , Soulard et al . 2002 , Tong et al . 2002 , Warren et al . 2002 ) . Thus , the study of yeast SH3 domain - containing proteins is essential to understand the regulation of actin polymerization and the internalization step of endocytosis . We and others have recently shown that Bzz1p is an actin patch protein that interacts directly with Las17p via a SH3 - polyproline interaction ( Soulard et al . 2002 , Tong et al . 2002 ) . Bzz1p is a member of the PCH ( Pombe Cdc15 ho - mology ) family that contains proteins such as Cdc15p in S . pombe , Hof1p in S . cerevisiae , PSTPIP in Mus musculus , and CIP4 ( Cdc42 interacting protein ) in Homo sapien s . In - terestingly , many of the characterized proteins of the PCH family are involved in actin cytoskeleton functions such as actin organization , endocytosis , and cytokinesis and interact with WASP family proteins ( Lippincott and Li 2000 ) . We found that Bzz1p coimmunoprecipitates with Las17p , Vrp1p , Myo3 / 5p , Bbc1p , Hsp70p ( heat shock protein ) , and actin ( Soulard et al . 2002 ) . While deletion of BZZ1 shows no obvious phenotype , simultaneous deletion of BZZ1 , MYO3 , and MYO5 genes is lethal and a bzz1 (cid:1) myo5 (cid:1) double mutant is unable to restore polarity of the actin cy - toskeleton after NaCl stress . We have further shown that GST - Bzz1p fusion protein coated on beads is able to recruit a functional actin polymerization machinery through its two C - terminal SH3 domains , and this in a manner dependent on Las17p , Vrp1p , and the type I myosins ( Soulard et al . 2002 ) . In this study , we show that Bzz1p functions with the type I myosins in the internalization step of endocytosis , while the destination of several cargoes of the endocytic , vacuolar sorting , and the MVB pathways appear unaf - fected . We further elucidate Bzz1p direct participation in actin polymerization by investigating the capacity of each of the SH3 domains of Bzz1p to trigger Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin polymerization in a cell - free system . Material and methods Plasmids , yeast strains , media , and molecular biology procedures The wild - type SLW001 , bzzl (cid:1) ( SLW701K ) , myo5 (cid:1) ( SLW501W ) , bzz1 (cid:1) myo5 (cid:1) ( SLW571WK ) , arp2 - 2 ( FKW201 ) , las17 (cid:1) ( FKW171H ) , vrp1 (cid:1) ( LBOR88 ) , wild - type RLY1 , and myo3 (cid:1) myo5 (cid:1) ( RLY822 ) yeast strains were previously described ( Soulard et al . 2002 ) . In this study , we also used myo3 (cid:1) ( SLW301 , Mat a myo3 (cid:1) : : HIS3 his3 - (cid:1) 200 ura3 - 52 ) strain and bar1 derivatives of wild - type SLW001 ( SLW002 ) , bzz1 (cid:1) SLW701K ( SLW702K ) , myo5 (cid:1) SLW501W ( SLW502W ) , bzz1 (cid:1) myo5 (cid:1) SLW571WK ( SLW573WK ) strains for the (cid:2) - factor uptake . The plas - mids encoding Ste2 - GFP ( Stefan and Blumer 1999 ) , GFP - Vam3 ( Darsow et al . 1998 ) , GFP - Phm5p and GFP - Sna3p ( Reggiori and Pelham 2001 ) were previously described and were kind gifts from Christopher Stefan , Scott Emr , and Hugh Pelham , respectively . The plas - mid encoding the two SH3 domains of Bzz1p in fusion to the GST was previously described ( Soulard et al . 2002 ) . The two plasmids encoding the ﬁrst and the second SH3 domain of Bzz1p fused to GST have been described and were kindly provided by S . Paoluzi and G . Cesareni ( Tong et al . 2002 ) . Yeast cell cultures and genetic manipulations were carried out essentially as previously described ( Soulard et al . 2002 ) . DNA manipulations and transformation into E . coli DH5 (cid:2) and BL21 - DE3 ( Novagen ) cells were performed according to standard protocols . Endocytosis assays Lucifer yellow - carbohydrazide ( LY ) assays and 35 S - labeled (cid:2) - factor up - take assays were performed on mid - log - phase cells using the continuous presence protocol as described ( Dulic et al . 1991 ) . All uptake assays were performed at least twice . Representative cells are shown for LY uptake . For 35 S - labeled (cid:2) - factor uptake , the results from two independent experi - ments which gave nearly identical results are shown . Immunoﬂorescence and microscopy Living cells expressing GFP fusion proteins were harvested at an op - tical density at 600 nm of 0 . 5 and resuspended in phosphate - buffered saline for visualization . In vivo , labelling of yeast vacuoles with FM 4 - 64 ( N - ( 3 - triethylammoniumpropyl ) - 4 ( 6 - ( 4 - ( diethylamino ) phenyl ) - hexatrienyl ) pyridinium dibromide ) was done as described ( Vida and Emr 1995 ) . Cells were visualized on a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope equipped with ﬂuorescence optics and images were captured with a Nikon Digital DXM1200 camera ( Plateforme de microscopie et d’imagerie de l’IBMP , Strasbourg ) . Bead - directed actin polymerization assay Puriﬁcation of GST recombinant fusion proteins and preparation of yeast protein extracts were done as previously described ( Soulard et al . 2002 ) . The bead - directed actin polymerization assay was essentially performed as described by Geli et al . ( 2000 ) with slight modiﬁcations ( Soulard et al . 2002 ) . To summarize , 7 (cid:3) l of yeast protein extract was mixed with 1 (cid:3) l of ARS ( 10 mg of creatine kinase per ml , 10 mM ATP , 10 mM MgCl 2 , 400 mM creatine phosphate ) and 1 (cid:3) l of 10 (cid:3) M Alexa Fluor 568 - labeled actin ( Molecular Probes ) . The actin polymerization reaction was initiated by adding 1 (cid:3) l of 50 % glutathione - Sepharose beads bound to 2 to 3 (cid:3) g of GST fusion proteins . Where indicated , la - trunculin A was added at a ﬁnal concentration of 10 (cid:3) M before the ad - dition of the fusion protein beads . After incubation for 20 min at room temperature , samples were visualized with a ﬂuorescence microscope ( Nikon Optiphot - 2 ) and images taken with a charge - coupled - device camera ( Photonics Science Coolview 10 ) . All the assays were per - formed at least twice ; the results shown are from one of similar inde - pendent experiments . A . Soulard et al . : Yeast protein Bzz1p functions with Myo5p in endocytosis 91 Results Bzz1p required with type I myosins for endocytosis We have shown that Bzz1p is implicated with type I myosin , Myo5p , in the regulation of actin polymerization ( Soulard et al . 2002 ) . Myo3p and Myo5p are required for the uptake step of endocytosis ( Geli and Riezman 1996 ) . Given that a triple bzz1 (cid:1) myo3 (cid:1) myo5 (cid:1) mutant is nonviable , we asked whether Bzz1p is required with one of the type I myosins for the internalization step of endocytosis by testing ﬂuid - phase and receptor - mediated endocytosis ( Figs . 1 and 2 ) . Fluid - phase endocytosis was analyzed by following the ac - cumulation of the ﬂuorescent dye LY in the vacuole after a 40 min incubation at 24 and 37 (cid:4) C . Wild - type and bzz1 (cid:1) mutant cells accumulated LY in the vacuole irrespective of the temperature of incubation , whereas the myo5 (cid:1) cells which took up LY at 24 (cid:4) C showed very little LY uptake at 37 (cid:4) C compared to 24 (cid:4) C ( Fig . 1 ) . In the bzz1 (cid:1) myo5 (cid:1) dou - ble - mutant strain , uptake of LY appeared defective at both 92 A . Soulard et al . : Yeast protein Bzz1p functions with Myo5p in endocytosis Fig . 1 . Bzz1p and Myo5p are implicated in ﬂuid - phase endocytosis . Wild - type ( WT ) cells ( SLW001 ) , bzz1 (cid:1) ( SLW701K ) , myo5 (cid:1) ( SLW501W ) , and bzz1 (cid:1) myo5 (cid:1) ( SLW571WK ) mutant cells were grown at 24 (cid:4) C and tested for LY accumulation in the vacuole for 40 min at 24 and 37 (cid:4) C after a 30 min preshift . The same ﬁeld of cells viewed by ﬂuorescence ( LY ) and by Nomarski optics ( DIC [ differential interference contrast ] ) is shown . At the bottom , enlarged views of typical individual cells after LY uptake at 24 (cid:4) C are shown temperatures as very little accumulation in the vacuole was observed ( Fig . 1 ) . The defect in the double mutant thus ap - pears to be due to the deﬁciency of the Myo5p function at 37 (cid:4) C . However , since myo5 (cid:1) cells at 24 (cid:4) C internalized the dye , the internalization defect in the double mutant bzz1 (cid:1) myo5 (cid:1) represents a shared function of Myo5p and Bzz1p . Nonetheless , the observed reduction in LY uptake in the myo5 (cid:1) and the bzz1 (cid:1) myo5 (cid:1) mutant cells does not repre - sent a complete endocytotic block because after a longer pe - riod of uptake ( 60 min ) , some ﬂuorescent dye could be observed in the vacuole ( data not shown ) . To further elucidate possible endocytotic defects in a quantitative manner , receptor - mediated endocytosis was an - alyzed by following internalization of 35 S - labeled (cid:2) - factor at 24 and 37 (cid:4) C over time in wild - type , bzz1 (cid:1) , myo5 (cid:1) , and bzz1 (cid:1) myo5 (cid:1) cells ( Fig . 2 ) . Cells were grown at 24 (cid:4) C and after a 20 min incubation at either 24 or 37 (cid:4) C radiolabelled (cid:2) - factor was added to cells . The percentage of internalized pheromone at each time point was determined by dividing internal ( pH 1 resistant ) counts by the total cell - associated ( pH 6 resistant ) counts . At 37 (cid:4) C , the myo5 (cid:1) mutant strain was severely deﬁcient in internalization of (cid:2) - factor when A . Soulard et al . : Yeast protein Bzz1p functions with Myo5p in endocytosis 93 Fig . 2A , B . Bzz1p functions with Myo5p in receptor - mediated endocytosis . A Strains SLW002 ( WT ) , SLW702K ( bzz1 (cid:1) ) , SLW502W ( myo5 (cid:1) ) , and SLW573WK ( bzz1 (cid:1) myo5 (cid:1) ) were assayed for (cid:2) - factor internalization at 24 (cid:4) C by the continuous - presence protocol . The results were expres - sed as the percentage of internalization as a function of time . The bar graph on the right represents the initial rate of (cid:2) - factor inter - nalization calculated for the ﬁrst 10 min of uptake . B The same experiment was done at 37 (cid:4) C after a 30 min preshift to 37 (cid:4) C compared with wild - type or bzz1 (cid:1) mutant cells ( Fig . 2B ) and consequently the bzz1 (cid:1) myo5 (cid:1) mutant strain showed comparable internalization . However , at 24 (cid:4) C , the single mutants bzz1 (cid:1) and myo5 (cid:1) internalized (cid:2) - factor at a rate comparable to wild - type cells , whereas the double mutant bzz1 (cid:1) myo5 (cid:1) cells showed a partial (cid:2) - factor internalization defect ( Fig . 2A ) . Taken together , the above results demon - strate that Bzz1p functions with the type I myosin Myo5p in the internalization step of ligand - dependent endocytosis as revealed by an internalization defect in only the double mu - tant at 24 (cid:4) C . Bzz1p and Myo5p not required for vacuolar delivery of cargoes It was recently shown that Las17p activation of actin poly - merization is required for endosome motility and delivery of endocytic cargo to the vacuole ( Chang et al . 2003 ) . We have shown that Bzz1p and Myo5p associate in a complex with Las17p in cell extracts ( Soulard et al . 2002 ) . To investigate whether the association of Bzz1p with type I myosins was also required after the internalization step in intracellular traf - ﬁc , that is , for delivery of endocytic and biosynthetic cargoes to the vacuole , we compared the intracellular localization of an endocytic cargo , Ste2 - GFP , the (cid:2) - factor pheromone re - ceptor ( Stefan and Blumer 1999 ) , and a biosynthetic cargo , GFP - Vam3 , a syntaxin - related protein , required for vacuolar assembly ( Darsow et al . 1998 ) . Strains transformed by plas - mids expressing each of these cargos were examined in wild - type , bzz1 (cid:1) , myo5 (cid:1) and bzz1 (cid:1) myo5 (cid:1) cells at 24 (cid:4) C ( Fig . 3 ) and 37 (cid:4) C ( data not shown ) . These cells were also labeled with the lipophilic dye FM 4 - 64 , which is endocytosed from the external medium ( Fig . 3 ) . After exposure of cells to FM 4 - 64 , the dye initially labels the plasma membrane and then intermediate endosomal compartments and ﬁnally accu - mulates at the vacuolar membrane ( Vida and Emr 1995 ) . In the following experiments , FM 4 - 64 was thus used as a counterstain to label the vacuolar membrane . In wild - type cells not stimulated by (cid:2) - factor , Ste2 - GFP localizes to the plasma membrane and undergoes normal ligand - independent endocytosis through endocytic vesicles and then accumulates in the vacuolar lumen at both 24 and 37 (cid:4) C ( Fig . 3A ) ( Stefan and Blumer 1999 ) . At 37 (cid:4) C , in the myo5 (cid:1) and bzz1 (cid:1) myo5 (cid:1) cells the vacuole was present but did not label with Ste2 - GFP ( data not shown ) , an expected consequence when endocytic internalization is blocked ( as shown in Fig . 2 for ligand - stim - ulated internalization of (cid:2) - factor ) . At 24 (cid:4) C , where the bzz1 (cid:1) myo5 (cid:1) double mutant shows a partial endocytic defect , the bzz1 (cid:1) , myo5 (cid:1) , and bzz1 (cid:1) myo5 (cid:1) mutant cells accumulated Ste2 - GFP in the vacuolar lumen as in the wild type ( Fig . 3A ) . These results suggest that Bzz1p and Myo5p are not required for the further delivery of endocytic cargo to the vacuole . That is , these steady - state observations show that dye , once it is endocytosed , arrives at its ﬁnal destination in the vacuolar lumen . The vacuolar t - SNARE Vam3p is transported from the Golgi apparatus to the vacuole through the alkaline phos - phatase ( ALP ) pathway . In wild - type cells , GFP - Vam3 localizes almost exclusively to the vacuolar membrane irre - spective of the temperature of incubation ( Fig . 3B ) ( Darsow et al . 1998 ) . In cells lacking Bzz1p and / or Myo5p , GFP - Vam3 accumulated on vacuolar membranes as revealed by FM 4 - 64 counterstaining at both 37 °C ( data not shown ) and 24 (cid:4) C ( Fig . 3B ) . These results indicate that mutant cells lacking Bzz1p , Myo5p , or both Bzz1p and Myo5p are ca - pable of sorting biosynthetic cargo to the vacuole by the ALP pathway . Bzz1p and Myo5p not required for sorting into the MVB pathway The sorting of membrane proteins into the vacuole is a speciﬁc process that requires internalization into the in - tralumenal vesicles of the late endosome or MVB ( Raiborg et al . 2003 ) . To determine whether Bzz1p and / or Myo5p are required for sorting into the MVB pathway , we ana - lyzed the sorting of two biosynthetic MVB cargoes that are transported along the CPY pathway , Phm5p ( a vacuolar polyphosphatase ) , which requires ubiquitylation for its in - corporation into the internal vesicles of MVB , and Sna3p ( a transporter ) , which does not require ubiquitin modiﬁca - tion ( Reggiori and Pelham 2001 ) . GFP - tagged versions of Phm5p and Sna3p were expressed from plasmids in wild - type , bzz1 (cid:1) , myo5 (cid:1) , and bzz1 (cid:1) myo5 (cid:1) cells and intracel - lular localization of the proteins was determined at 24 and 37 (cid:4) C by ﬂuorescence microscopy after labelling of the vacuolar membrane with FM 4 - 64 ( Fig . 4 ) . In wild - type cells , GFP - Phm5 and GFP - Sna3 fusion proteins showed bright staining of the vacuolar lumen . This localization re - sults from sorting of cargoes into the intralumenal vesicles of the MVB followed by delivery to the vacuole and matu - ration of the cargo GFP fusion protein by proteolysis giving rise to the release of free GFP ( Fig . 4 ) . In all the mutants , GFP - Phm5 ( Fig . 4A ) and GFP - Sna3 ( Fig . 4B ) constructs showed clear intravacuolar GFP ﬂuorescence , indicating that in these cells both proteins are properly sorted into the MVB vesicles and delivered to the lumen of the vacuole . These results suggest that Bzz1p and Myo5p are not required for either ubiquitin - dependent or ubiquitin - independent sorting into the MVB pathway . 94 A .

A The localization of GFP - Phm5 , a biosynthetic MVB cargo that requires ubiquitination for its sorting , was studied in wild - type ( WT , SLW001 ) , bzz1 (cid:1) ( SLW701K ) , myo5 (cid:1) ( SLW501W ) , and bzz1 (cid:1) myo5 (cid:1) ( SLW571WK ) cells at 24 (cid:4) C by ﬂuorescence microscopy . The cells were doubly labelled with the FM 4 - 64 dye to reveal vacuolar membranes and analyzed by ﬂuorescence and DIC microscopy . B The same analysis was done with GFP - Sna3 , a biosynthetic MVB cargo that does not require ubiquitin modiﬁcation for internalization and sorting Each of the Bzz1p SH3 domains induces actin polymerization We have previously shown that Bzz1p triggers actin poly - merization in vitro through its two C - terminal SH3 domains ( Soulard et al . 2002 ) . In the case of Myo5p , a polypeptide containing the single SH3 domain in addition to part of the TH2 ( talin homology 2 ) domain and the C - terminal acid do - main induces actin polymerization in vitro ( Geli et al . 2000 ) . This domain was shown to be required for different actin functions such as organelle dynamics , cell wall biogenesis , and nuclear division ( Anderson et al . 1998 ) . To determine whether each of the two SH3 domains of Bzz1p is sufﬁcient to induce actin polymerization , we expressed each domain as a GST fusion protein ( GST - BZZ1 - SH3 - 1 amino acids 496 – 533 and GST - BZZ1 - SH3 - 2 amino acids 580 – 633 ) and tested their ability , when coated on glutathione - Sepharose beads , to trigger whole - cell - extract - dependent actin poly - merization compared to that of a construct bearing both SH3 domains ( GST - BZZ1 - SH3 - SH3 amino acids 446 – 633 ) ( Fig . 5 ) . De novo polymerization of actin ﬁlaments was monitored by ﬂuorescence microscopy in the presence of ﬂuorescent Alexa 568 – actin added to yeast cell extracts which gave rise to the accumulation of a ﬂuorescent signal around the beads ( Geli et al . 2000 , Soulard et al . 2002 ) . Beads coated with each SH3 domain alone ( BZZ1 - SH3 - 1 and BZZ1 - SH3 - 2 ) incubated in the presence of a wild - type yeast protein extract accumulated a distinct ﬂuorescent sig - nal , similar to the beads coated with the GST - BZZ1 - SH3 - SH3 fusion protein ( Fig . 5 ) . That this signal was due to de novo actin polymerization was demonstrated by the fact that there was no detectable signal when the yeast cell extracts were pretreated with latrunculin A , a drug which sequesters actin monomers and results in rapid depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton ( data not shown ) . Thus , we conclude that each SH3 domain of Bzz1p independently is able to induce de novo actin polymerization in vitro . Earlier studies pointed out the role of the Arp2 / 3 com - plex and the WASP homolog Las17 / Bee1 in actin polymer - ization regulation ( Lechler et al . 2001 , Li 1997 , Madania et al . 1999 , Moreau et al . 1996 ) . We showed previously that in vitro actin polymerization triggered by the full - length Bzz1p GST fusion construct requires a functional Arp2 / 3 complex and Las17p ( Soulard et al . 2002 ) . To determine whether the SH3 domains of Bzz1p had similar require - ments , we tested protein extracts from arp2 - 2 temperature - sensitive and las17 (cid:1) deletion mutants in this in vitro actin polymerization assay ( Fig . 5 ) . There was no visible ﬂuores - cent labelling of the beads in either of the extracts , showing that the SH3 domains of Bzz1p require both Arp2 / 3 com - plex and Las17p to polymerize actin . In this study , we show that Bzz1p functions with Myo5p in the internalization step of endocytosis . The yeast homolog of the human WIP , Vrp1 , interacts through its proline - rich motifs with Myo5p SH3 domain and this interaction is required for the induction of Myo5p - dependent actin polymerization ( Anderson et al . 1998 , Evangelista et al . 2000 , Geli et al . 2000 ) . To investigate whether Vrp1p and the type I myosins were required for actin polymerization induced by Bzz1p SH3 domains , we tested yeast protein extracts from vrp1 (cid:1) , myo3 (cid:1) , myo5 (cid:1) , and myo3 (cid:1) myo5 (cid:1) mutant cells in our in vitro assay ( Fig . 5 ) . Interestingly , the extracts from the vrp1 (cid:1) A . Soulard et al . : Yeast protein Bzz1p functions with Myo5p in endocytosis 97 Fig . 5 . The individual SH3 domains of Bzz1p are sufﬁcient to induce actin polymerization that is dependent on the Arp2 / 3 complex , Las17p , Vrp1 , and the type 1 myosins . Glutathione - Sepharose beads coated with GST fused to either the two SH3 domains of Bzz1p ( BZZ1 - SH3 - SH3 ) or to each SH3 domain alone ( BZZ1 – SH3 - 1 or BZZ1 – SH3 - 2 ) were incubated with whole - cell extracts from WT ( SLW001 ) , arp2 - 2 ( FKW201 ) , las17 (cid:1) ( FKW171H ) , vrp1 (cid:1) ( LBOR88 ) , myo3 (cid:1) ( SLW ) , or myo3 (cid:1) myo5 (cid:1) ( RLY822 ) yeast strains in the presence of an ATP - regenerating system and Alexa 568 - actin . Samples were incubated at 24 (cid:4) C for 20 min prior to observation by ﬂuorescence microscopy mutant and from the myo3 (cid:1) myo5 (cid:1) double - mutant cells were unable to trigger accumulation of ﬂuorescently labelled actin ﬁlaments around the beads coated with the SH3 domains of Bzz1p , whereas an extract from a single myo3 (cid:1) ( Fig . 5 ) or myo5 (cid:1) ( data not shown ) mutant allowed actin to polymerize . These results show that each single SH3 domain of Bzz1p is able to induce actin polymerization in vitro and displays similar requirements to either the full - length Bzz1p or the C - terminal part of the protein bearing the two SH3 domains . These requirements include a functional Arp2 / 3 complex , WASP / Las17 , WIP / Vrp1p , and the type 1 myosins Myo3p or Myo5p . Discussion In this paper , we have investigated the role of the Las17p - in - teracting protein Bzz1p in endocytosis and trafﬁcking to the vacuole . Our results show that Bzz1p interacts with the type I myosins in ﬂuid - phase endocytosis . Since the bzz1 (cid:1) myo3 (cid:1) myo5 (cid:1) triple mutant is lethal ( Soulard et al . 2002 ) , a bzz1 (cid:1) myo5 (cid:1) double mutant was investigated . As evidenced by less LY uptake to the vacuole at 24 (cid:4) C , the bzz1 (cid:1) myo5 (cid:1) double mutant was more severely affected than the single myo5 (cid:1) mutant . Although this defect is partial and can be overcome by incubation at longer times , it prompted us to examine ligand - stimulated receptor - mediated endocytosis by Ste2p . At higher temperature ( 37 (cid:4) C ) both myo5 (cid:1) and bzz1 (cid:1) myo5 (cid:1) mutants were unable to take up (cid:2) - factor . Since the loss of Myo5p alone was sufﬁcient to cause a se - vere defect in endocytosis at 37 (cid:4) C , the double mutant is not informative for Bzz1p in these conditions . Nevertheless , since the loss of Myo5p alone had little or no effect on en - docytosis at 24 (cid:4) C , investigation of the double mutant at this temperature was informative . Kinetic experiments at 24 (cid:4) C revealed that the bzz1 (cid:1) myo5 (cid:1) double mutant showed de - creased internalization of (cid:2) - factor compared to the wild type or single mutants . Thus , we conclude that Bzz1p has a synthetic effect with Myo5p and further suggest that it may be redundant for this function with Myo3p . Given that both ﬂuid - phase and receptor - mediated endocytosis appear to be affected , the defects observed are most likely related to a common function of these two types of endocytosis rather than to speciﬁc modiﬁcations required only for receptor - mediated endocytosis such as phosphorylation and ubiqui - tination of membrane proteins ( Galan et al . 1996 , Hicke and Riezman 1996 , Hicke et al . 1998 ) . Our earlier characteriza - tion of Bzz1p functions revealed a synthetic actin phenotype of a bzz1 (cid:1) myo5 (cid:1) but not a bzz1 (cid:1) myo3 (cid:1) mutant in the re - organization of a polarized actin cytoskeleton after NaCl stress ( Soulard et al . 2002 ) . Several studies showed that actin is required for the internalization step of both ﬂuid - phase and receptor - mediated endocytosis ( Riezman et al . 1996 , Moreau et al . 1997 ) . Therefore , Bzz1p could be re - quired with Myo5p for proper actin function at the plasma membrane during endocytic uptake , a function revealed at 24 (cid:4) C in conditions where endocytosis was largely unaf - fected by the absence of Myo5p alone . It was recently shown in both mammalian and yeast cells that Arp2 / 3 complex - dependent actin polymerization mediates propulsion of endosomes through the cytoplasm and is required for efﬁcient vacuolar delivery of endocy - tosed cargoes in S . cerevisiae ( Chang et al . 2003 , Taunton et al . 2000 ) . Another study showed that Sla1p and Sla2p interact in vitro and in vivo and that overexpression of the interacting fragment of Sla1p causes reduced ﬂuid - phase endocytosis and defects in subsequent trafﬁcking to vac - uoles ( Gourlay et al . 2003 ) . Additionally , a number of mu - tants along the vacuolar protein sorting pathway in S . cerevisiae have recently been found to have defects in the actin cytoskeleton or to involve some actin - related pro - teins ( Arp5p and Arp6p ) ( Bonangelino et al . 2002 , Friant et al . 2003 ) . These results suggest that actin could also be implicated in vacuolar sorting . Both Bzz1p and type I myosins are implicated in actin functions in S . cerevisiae ( Goodson et al . 1996 , Soulard et al . 2002 ) . Furthermore , the type I myosins were suggested to facilitate either the membrane constriction or the vesicle scission phase of en - docytosis ( Jonsdottir and Li 2004 ) . We previously showed that a bzz1 (cid:1) myo3 (cid:1) myo5 (cid:1) triple mutant is lethal ( Soulard et al . 2002 ) , indicating that these proteins are essential . To determine whether Bzz1p is implicated either alone or with type I myosins in vacuolar sorting , we analyzed the ALP Vps pathway , the vacuolar delivery of an endocytic cargo , and the MVB sorting pathway in cells lacking Bzz1p and / or Myo5p . In this study , we localized different cargoes as GFP fusion proteins , as their localization repre - sents a cellular steady - state or end point localization of dif - ferent proteins after membrane trafﬁcking through cellular pathways to the vacuole . Our results indicate that Bzz1p and Myo5p are not absolutely required for trafﬁcking through these different pathways . However , they do not ex - clude an eventual delay in protein sorting due to loss of Bzz1p and / or the type I myosins . To investigate this possi - bility further , investigation of individual pathways , such as kinetic analyses by pulse - chase of CPY , ALP , and CPS would be required . We and others showed that Bzz1p binds to Las17p and Myo5p in two - hybrid assays and is immunoprecipitated in a large complex that also contains Las17p and the type I myosins Myo3p and Myo5p , indicating that it can interact 98 A . Soulard et al . : Yeast protein Bzz1p functions with Myo5p in endocytosis with these proteins ( Soulard et al . 2002 , Tong et al . 2002 ) ( our unpublished results ) . We also showed that GFP - Bzz1p localized to cortical patches and that this localization is de - pendent on Las17p . Bzz1p was directly implicated in actin polymerization by showing that this protein could induce de novo nucleation of actin polymerization in a coated - bead as - say . This actin polymerization could be triggered by the two SH3 domains located at the C terminus of Bzz1p ( Soulard et al . 2002 ) . The ﬁrst demonstration in S . cerevisiae that an SH3 domain was implicated in stimulation of Arp2 / 3 - depen - dent nucleation was reported by Geli et al . ( 2000 ) , who showed that the C - terminal part of Myo5p containing the TH2 , SH3 , and acidic domains stimulated Arp2 / 3 - dependent polymerization in a Vrp1p - dependent manner . Furthermore , the SH3 domain of Myo5p was shown to be required for proper localization of Myo5p to actin patches ( Anderson et al . 1998 ) . Several other yeast SH3 domain - containing pro - teins are implicated in actin regulation ( Rvs167p , Lsb1 - 4p , Bbc1 , and Sla1p ) and interact directly with Las17p via their SH3 domain ( Madania et al . 1999 , Tong et al . 2002 , Warren et al . 2002 ) . Although Sla1p and Bbc1p SH3 domains were shown to mediate direct interactions with Las17p , these two proteins have an inhibitory activity on Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization in vitro . Moreover , Sla1p and Bbc1p share an overlapping role in vivo because the two Sla1p SH3 domains required for the inhibitory activity in vitro were also required in vivo with Bbc1p for normal actin organization and cell vi - ability ( Rodal et al . 2003 ) . Together , these studies clearly show that SH3 domains can either activate or inhibit actin polymerization . Here we show that each SH3 domain of Bzz1p on its own stimulates actin polymerization in the same in vitro actin polymerization assay that was previously used for the full - length and the SH3 - containing C - terminal frag - ment of Bzz1p . The fact that this polymerization is depen - dent on the presence of the Arp2 / 3 complex Las17p and type I myosins conﬁrms our earlier functional and physical interaction data and supports the proposition that the assay represents actin patch polymerization . Recently , several in vivo imaging studies provided evidence for the implication of actin patches in the internalization step of endocytosis ( Gourlay et al . 2003 , Jonsdottir and Li 2004 , Kaksonen et al . 2003 , Smith et al . 2001 ) . In the study by Kaksonen et al . ( 2003 ) , real - time imaging of six patch proteins revealed an ordered sequence of events at the plasma membrane where , it is proposed , actin patches are formed at sites already contain - ing part of the endocytic machinery . Changes in patch com - ponents corresponded to changes in patch behavior . Las17p , the ﬁrst visible protein , moves only in short oscillations close to the membrane and is joined by the endocytic proteins Sla1p , Sla2p , and Pan1p in patches which show slow move - ment over restricted distances . When the Arp2 / 3 complex and the activator Abp1p were visualized , the faster move - ment over greater distances that was observed may represent patches moving inwards , away from the plasma membrane . This stage also corresponds to maximal actin recruitment with a polymerization rate equivalent to highly motile cells ( Kaksonen et al . 2003 ) . In a separate study , type I myosin containing cortical patches were seen to be relatively nonmotile at the plasma membrane , just before their rapid and extended movement away from the membrane in Arp2 / 3 - associated structures ( Jonsdottir and Li 2004 ) . A myo5 mutant , which is also defective for ﬂuid - phase endocy - tosis , delays this fast - movement phase , suggesting that type I myosins could facilitate either the membrane constriction or the vesicle scission phase of endocytosis . In light of these dynamic studies and of our results showing the redundant function of Bzz1p and Myo5p in the recovery of actin patch polarity ( Soulard et al . 2002 ) and in the internalization step of endocytosis , two possi - ble functions can be hypothesized for Bzz1p . Bzz1p could serve as a linker protein ( perhaps one of several ) between Las17p and Myo3 / 5 and be required for efﬁcient endocytic internalization . The main function of Bzz1p could also be redundant with Myo3 / 5 for the constriction of the membrane or the scission of endocytic vesicles . However , to determine which of the above roles corre - sponds to Bzz1p main function , or whether it may play multiple roles in the actin machinery , further dynamic studies of its plasma membrane localization and move - ment are necessary . In summary , our results clearly show that the Las17p / WASP - interacting protein Bzz1p functions with the type I myosin Myo5p in the internalization step of ﬂuid - phase and receptor - mediated endocytosis . Many de - tails remain to be discovered , including the identiﬁcation of downstream effectors of Bzz1p and the dynamic local - ization of Bzz1p relative to other components in cortical patches at the plasma membrane . Dynamic studies in vivo , as well as genetic and molecular studies of protein interac - tions , should provide the basis for a more detailed under - standing of the role of Bzz1p in endocytic internalization .
