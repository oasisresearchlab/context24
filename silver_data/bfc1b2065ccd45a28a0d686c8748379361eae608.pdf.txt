Tandon contributed equally to this work To understand the trafﬁcking of endocytosed hemo - globin ( Hb ) in Leishmania , we investigated the charac - teristics of in vitro fusion between endosomes containing biotinylated Hb ( BHb ) and avidin – horse - radish peroxidase ( AHRP ) . We showed that early endosome fusion in Leishmania is temperature and cytosol dependent and is inhibited by ATP depletion , ATP g S , GTP g S and N - ethylmaleimide treatment . The Rab5 homolog from Leishmania donovani , LdRab5 , was cloned and expressed . Our results showed that homotypic fusion between the early endosomes in Leishmania is Rab5 dependent . Early endosomes containing BHb fused efﬁciently with late endosomes in a process regulated by Rab7 , whereas no fusion between early and late endosomes was detected using ﬂuid phase markers . Pre - treatment of early endosomes containing BHb with monoclonal antibody speciﬁc for the C - terminus of the Hb receptor ( HbR ) or the addition of the C - terminal cytoplasmic fragment of the HbR speciﬁcally inhibited the fusion with late endosomes , suggesting that signal ( s ) medi - ated through the HbR cytoplasmic tail promotes the fusion of early endosomes containing Hb with late endosomes . Keywords : endocytosis / Hb / Leishmania / Rab / reconstitution Introduction Endocytosis is a fundamental process that mediates internalization , sorting and degradation of endocytosed molecules ( Wileman et al . , 1985 ) . In protozoan parasites , endocytosis is mainly studied in trypanosomatids ( Clayton et al . , 1995 ; Liu et al . , 2000 ) , and a few receptor systems mediating efﬁcient supply of nutrients have been identiﬁed ( Voyiatzaki and Soteriadou 1992 ; Bastin et al . , 1996 ) . However , the intracellular route and mechanism of transport of internalized materials in these parasites remain largely unknown . Recent studies have established that transport of cargo along the endocytic pathway requires a series of coordinated and speciﬁc vesicle fusion events regulated by small GTP - binding proteins of the Rab family ( Zerial and McBride , 2001 ) . Among the endocytic Rabs , Rab7 is involved in transport from the early to late compartment ( Feng et al . , 1995 ; Mukhopadhyay et al . , 1997b ) , whereas Rab5 regulates transport from the plasma membrane to the early compartment as well as homotypic fusion among early endosomes ( Gorvel et al . , 1991 ; Mukhopadhyay et al . , 1997a ) . Indications of similar endocytic and secretory pathways in trypanosomatids , reported recently ( McConville et al . , 2002 ) , remain to be characterized . Homologs of Rab4 , Rab5 , Rab7 and Rab11 have been identiﬁed in Trypanosoma brucei . Rab4 and Rab11 appear to be involved in recycling , while different isoforms of Rab5 regulate distinct steps in endocytosis ( Field and Field , 1997 ; Field et al . , 1998 ; Pal et al . , 2002 ) . Rab7 , and to a lesser extent Rab4 , are associated with the endocytic pathway in Dictyostelium discoideum ( Temesvari et al . , 1994 ; Laurent et al . , 1998 ) . In Toxoplasma gondii , Rab5 regulates cholesterol acquisition from the host cell ( Robibaro et al . , 2002 ) and Rab6 is involved in sorting of post - Golgi secretory granules ( Stedman et al . , 2003 ) . However , regulation of intracellular trafﬁcking by Rab GTPases in protozoan parasites remains to be elucidated . Recently , we have shown that endocytosis of hemoglobin ( Hb ) in Leishmania is mediated through receptors located in the ﬂagellar pocket ( Sengupta et al . , 1999 ) , possibly to generate intracellular heme after degradation of inter - nalized Hb , as Leishmania lack a complete heme biosynthetic pathway ( Sah et al . , 2002 ) . In order to understand the regulation of Hb trafﬁcking in Leishmania , we have reconstituted endosome fusions using endosomes containing Hb puriﬁed from Leishmania promastigotes . Here we report the cloning and expression of Rab5 from L . donovani and show that the early endosome in Leishmania is a very dynamic compartment and promotes fusion with early and late compartments during Hb trafﬁcking . Results Cloning and expression of Rab5 homolog from L . donovani To clone the Rab5 homolog from L . donovani , a BLAST ( Karlin and Altschul , 1993 ) search was carried out using human Rab5 as a query . Genes from divergent genera of protozoa showed signiﬁcant similarity with human Rab5 , e . g . D . discoideum ( 88 % ) , T . gondii ( 75 % ) , Plasmodium falciparum ( 78 % ) , Entamoeba histolytica ( 78 % ) and T . brucei ( 61 % ) . As Trypanosma are closest to Leishmania , a second search was carried out using T . brucei Rab5B sequence as a query , which revealed a putative Rab5 - like sequence from L . major with 72 % homology . Putative start and stop codons were predicted and appropriate forward and reverse primers were used to Rab5 - mediated endosome – endosome fusion regulates hemoglobin endocytosis in Leishmania donovani The EMBO Journal Vol . 22 No . 21 pp . 5712 – 5722 , 2003 5712 ª European Molecular Biology Organization amplify a fragment ( 636 bp ) from L . donovani cDNA by PCR . The PCR product was cloned , sequenced and hypothetically translated ( 211 amino acids ) . A BLAST search revealed that the cloned protein ( LdRab5 ) has ~ 91 % similarities with L . major putative Rab5 , 65 % with T . brucei Rab5 , 66 % with T . gondii Rab5 , 62 % with D . melanogaster Rab5 and 59 % with human and mouse Rab5 . Comparison of LdRab5 sequence with other Rab5 sequences using ClustalW multiple sequence alignment ( Version 1 . 8 ; Thompson et al . , 1994 ) demonstrated the presence of conserved Rab protein features ( Stenmark and Olkkonen , 2001 ) including the GTP - binding region , effector loop and C - terminal isoprenylation motif ( Figure 1 ) . Characterization of Rab5 from L . donovani GTP binding and GTPase activities of GST – LdRab5 were determined using free GST and mammalian GST – Rab5 as controls . Figure 2A shows that unlike free GST , GST – LdRab5 bound a signiﬁcant amount of [ a - 32 P ] GTP . The binding of [ a - 32 P ] GTP was competed out by unlabeled GTP and GDP but not by ATP , indicating the speciﬁcity of guanine nucleotide binding of LdRab5 ( Figure 2B ) . However , kinetic analysis of GTPase activity revealed that LdRab5 GTPase activity is comparatively reduced with respect to mammalian Rab5 ( Figure 2C ) . Speciﬁcity of antibodies against LdRab5 and LdRab7 Antibodies against LdRab5 and LdRab7 were raised to characterize Hb trafﬁcking in Leishmania . Western blot analysis showed that antibodies against LdRab5 and LdRab7 speciﬁcally recognized an ~ 23 kDa and an ~ 27 kDa protein , respectively , from Leishmania lysate ( Figure 3 ) and did not cross - react with GST ( data not shown ) . Subcellular fractionation and preparation of Rab5 - enriched early endosomal compartment from Leishmania Previously we showed that Hb is internalized efﬁciently into the endocytic compartment within 5 min in Leishmania ( Sengupta et al . , 1999 ) . Thus , internalization of biotinylated Hb ( BHb ) for 5 min was used to label the endocytic compartment . Another set of endosomes was labeled by 5 min internalization of avidin – horseradish peroxidase ( AHRP ) , a ﬂuid phase marker ( Gorvel et al . , 1991 ) . In order to characterize compartments labeled with AHRP , subcellular fractionation was carried out and HRP activity was estimated from different fractions ( 50 m l ) collected from the top of the gradient . Maximum HRP activity was obtained at the 8 – 30 % interface ( Figure 4 ) . No signiﬁcant HRP activity was detected at the top of the gradient , indicating that most of the endosomes were intact . Five successive fractions were pooled , washed and solubilized in SDS buffer , and western blot analyses were carried out to determine the nature of the compartments . Results presented in Figure 4 show that Rab5 and transferrin receptor were predominantly present in fraction numbers 6 – 10 , which retained maximum HRP activity , whereas a Rab7 - positive compartment was found in the later fractions with relatively low HRP activity .

Rab5 - regulated endosome fusion in Leishmania 5713 doublet observed for Rab5 might be isoforms or prenylated and non - prenylated protein . Maximum activity of 5 ¢ - nucleotidase , a plasma membrane marker , was detected in the lighter fractions having relatively lower HRP activity ( Figure 4 ) . Hb was also detected in the fractions enriched in Rab5 and transferrin receptor , when similar fractionation was carried out following 5 min internalization of BHb . Reconstitution and characterization of in vitro endosome – endosome fusion in Leishmania Reconstitution of endosome fusion has been used suc - cessfully to determine the requirements for endocytosis ( Gorvel et al . , 1991 ) . The results presented in Figure 5A show a typical in vitro fusion experiment in which two sets of endosomes containing BHb or AHRP were incubated for 1 h at 23 (cid:176) C in the presence of an ATP - regenerating system containing different concentrations of gel - ﬁltered cytosol prepared from Leishmania promastigotes . Maximum fusion between the endosomes was observed at 1 mg / ml cytosol concentration . No fusion was detected in the absence of cytosol , suggesting a role for the cytosolic components in endosome fusion . The extent of early endosome fusion in Leishmania was signiﬁcantly more at 23 (cid:176) C than at 37 (cid:176) C , whereas no fusion was detected at 4 (cid:176) C ( data not shown ) . To determine the energy requirement , endosome fusion was carried out in an ATP - depleting system [ 250 mM sucrose , 0 . 5 mM EGTA , 20 mM HEPES - KOH pH 7 . 2 , 1 mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) , 1 . 5 mM MgCl 2 , 100 mM KCl containing 5 mM glucose and 25 U / ml hexokinase , and 0 . 25 mg / ml avidin as scavenger ] . Under these conditions , as well as in the Fig . 2 . Characterization of Rab5 from L . donovani . ( A ) GTP binding of the indicated concentrations of LdRab5 was detected using a [ a - 32 P ] GTP overlay assay . Free GST and mammalian Rab5 were used as control . ( B ) [ a - 32 P ] GTP binding was measured in the absence ( control ) or presence of 1 mM of the indicated nucleotides . ( C ) The kinetics of GTPase activity of LdRab5 were determined as described in Materials and methods . Mammalian Rab5 wild - type ( WT ) protein and Rab5 : Q79L , a GTP locked mutant , were used as control . Results are representative of three independent preparations . Fig . 3 . Speciﬁcity of Leishmania Rab5 and Rab7 antibodies . Leishmania cell lysate ( 40 m g / lane ) was analyzed by western blot using speciﬁc antibodies against LdRab5 and LdRab7 . Results of western blots are representative of three independent preparations . Fig . 4 . Subcellular fractionation of the L . donovani endocytic compart - ment . Promastigotes were disrupted after internalization of AHRP , and PNS was loaded onto a discontinuous sucrose gradient as described in Materials and methods . After centrifugation , 50 m l fractions were col - lected from the top of the gradient and analyzed for the presence of HRP . Five successive fractions from the top of the gradient were pooled , washed and analyzed by western blot for the presence of the indicated proteins ( TfR , transferrin receptor ) . 5 ¢ - Nucleotidase activity was also measured from the pooled fractions . Similar fractionation was carried out using BHb as a probe , and the presence of Hb in the frac - tions was analyzed by western blot using anti - Hb antibody . Results from western blots are representative of three independent preparations . S . B . Singh et al . 5714 presence of a 4 . 5 m M ATP g S - containing ATP - regenerating system , signiﬁcant inhibition of fusion was observed between endosomes , indicating that both ATP and ATP hydrolysis are required for this process ( Figure 5B ) . About 80 % fusion between early endosomes at a high cytosol concentration ( 1 . 5 mg / ml ) was inhibited by 25 m M GTP g S , a non - hydrolyzable analog of GTP ( Figure 5C ) . Moreover , treatment of endosomes containing BHb with 6 m g / ml of mammalian GDI ( GDP dissociation inhibitor ) in the presence of 1 mM GDP speciﬁcally removed Leishmania Rab protein , i . e . Rab5 , but not transferrin receptor ( Figure 5D , inset ) . Rab - depleted endosomes containing BHb inhibited fusion with endosomes contain - ing AHRP by ~ 90 % , indicating that Rab GTPases may be regulating this fusion process ( Figure 5D ) . Role of NSF - like protein in endosome fusion in Leishmania In vitro fusion between endosomes from mammalian cells is inhibited by N - ethylmaleimide ( NEM ) treat - ment and can be restored by the addition of NEM - sensitive factor ( NSF ) ( Diaz et al . , 1989 ) . To deter - mine the role of NSF in early endosome fusion in Leishmania , fusion was carried out in the presence of different concentrations of NEM . Figure 6A shows that ~ 70 % of the fusion was inhibited by 0 . 3 mM NEM . Endosome fusion was also signiﬁcantly abrogated in cytosol immunodepleted with antibody against mam - malian NSF , which detected an ~ 70 kDa protein , presumably the NSF homolog , in Leishmania lysate ( Figure 6B , inset ) . Fig . 5 . Characterization of in vitro early endosome fusion in Leishmania . ( A ) Two sets of early endosomes containing BHb or AHRP were incubated in the presence of an ATP - regenerating fusion buffer supplemented with different concentrations of gel - ﬁltered Leishmania cytosol for 1 h at 23 (cid:176) C . Speciﬁc fusion ( ﬁlled circles ) was measured by subtracting the value obtained in the absence of cytosol from the total fusion ( open circles ) observed in the presence of cytosol as indicated in Materials and methods . Maximum fusion was observed at 1 mg / ml of cytosol , which was normalized to 1 U , and results are expressed as relative fusion of three independent experiments 6 SD . One unit corresponds to 12 ng of HRP activity / mg of protein . ( B ) In vitro fusion between endosomes from Leishmania was carried out in an ATP - regenerating system ( Control ) , ATP - depleted system or in the presence of ATP g S ( 4 . 5 m M ) . Fusion obtained in the control was chosen as 1 U , and the results are expressed as relative fusion of three independent experiments 6 SD . One unit corresponds to 13 . 6 ng of HRP activity / mg of protein . ( C ) Fusion between endosomes in Leishmania was carried out in an ATP - regenerating system in the presence of different concentrations of GTP g S and 1 . 5 mg / ml cytosol . Fusion obtained in the absence of GTP g S was chosen as 1 U , and the results are expressed as relative fusion of three independent experiments 6 SD . One unit corresponds to 12 . 6 ng of HRP activity / mg of protein . ( D ) Endosomes containing BHb treated either with GDP ( 1 mM ) alone or with GDI ( 6 m g / ml ) as described ( Mukherjee et al . , 2000 ) were centrifuged and pellets were analyzed for the presence of Rab protein by western blot using anti - LdRab5 . Transferrin receptor ( TfR ) was used as a control ( inset ) . Treated and untreated ( control ) endosomes containing BHb were used in the fusion assay . Fusion obtained with untreated endosomes was chosen as 1 U , and results are expressed as relative fusion of three independent experiments 6 SD . One unit corresponds to 14 . 5 ng of HRP activity / mg of protein . Rab5 - regulated endosome fusion in Leishmania 5715 Role of endocytic Rabs in intracellular trafﬁcking of Hb To determine the role of endocytic Rabs in endosome fusion in Leishmania , fusion of BHb - loaded early endo - somes with early endosomes containing AHRP was carried out in the presence of Rab5 - or Rab7 - immunode - pleted cytosol . Anti - LdRab5 and anti - LdRab7 speciﬁcally depleted the respective proteins from Leishmania cytosol ( Figure 7A , inset ) . Fusion between early endosomes was inhibited by ~ 75 % in Rab5 - depleted cytosol , whereas Rab7 depletion reduced fusion by only ~ 25 % ( Figure 7A ) . Addition of in vitro prenylated LdRab5 ( Lombardi et al . , 1993 ) to the Rab5 - depleted system completely restored fusion to the control level ( Figure 7A ) . Previous studies have shown that early endosomes can fuse with early endosomes , whereas in vitro fusion between early and late endosomes does not occur ( Gorvel et al . , 1991 ) . This prompted us to test heterotypic fusion between early and late endosomes in Leishmania . Accordingly , late endoso - mal fractions were prepared by 5 min internalization of AHRP followed by 15 min chase at 23 (cid:176) C , as described previously ( Gorvel et al . , 1991 ; Laurent et al . , 1998 ) , and separated by sucrose gradient . Partial characterization of fractions containing maximum HRP activity revealed that these vesicles predominantly contain Rab7 , a late endosomal marker , but no Rab5 or transferrin receptor , whereas 5 min internalized AHRP vesicles possess early endosomal markers such as Rab5 and transferrin receptor ( Figure 7B ) . In contrast to the previous study ( Gorvel et al . , 1991 ) , ~ 80 % fusion between BHb - loaded early endosomes and late endosomes containing AHRP was observed in Leishmania ( Figure 7C ) . However , consistent with the earlier report , Figure 7C shows that early endosomes containing ﬂuid phase markers such as avidin and biotinylated HRP ( BHRP ) fuse efﬁciently , whereas fusions of early endosomes containing avidin with late endosomes containing BHRP is signiﬁcantly inhibited . Moreover , Figure 7D shows that the observed heterotypic fusion between BHb - loaded early endosomes and late endosome containing AHRP is signiﬁcantly inhibited in the presence of Rab7 - depleted cytosol but not by Rab5 - depleted cytosol . Addition of in vitro prenylated LdRab7 to the Rab7 - depleted system signiﬁcantly restored fusion ( Figure 7D ) . These results indicate that the cytoplasmic tail of the Hb receptor ( HbR ) from early endosomes containing BHb may possibly promote this heterotypic fusion . To determine the role of the cytoplasmic tail of the HbR in heterotypic fusion , we have cloned and expressed different deletion mutants of the receptor as GST fusion proteins ( Figure 8A ) : the N - terminus ( HbR - D C ) , middle region ( HbR - D NC ) and C - terminus ( HbR - D N ) . Figure 8B shows that polyclonal antibody against HbR puriﬁed from Leishmania ( PHbR ) recognized HbR - D NC and HbR - D N , while a monoclonal antibody ( 1B6 ) speciﬁcally recog - nized HbR - D N . In addition , HbR - D C predominantly bound to Hb , in comparison with other fragments . PHbR was used as a positive control . No binding was observed with GST ( data not shown ) . When BHb - loaded early endosomes were pre - treated with 1B6 , heterotypic fusion with late endosomes containing AHRP was signiﬁcantly inhibited . Moreover , addition of HbR - D N in the fusion assay inhibited ~ 80 % of fusion , whereas no signiﬁcant inhibition was observed with HbR - D C or HbR - D NC ( Figure 8C ) . Localization of Rab5 in Leishmania Immunolocalization showed that L . donovani Rab5 is localized in the anterior end near the ﬂagellar reservoir ( Figure 9G ) , which is indicated by the presence of nucleus and kinetoplast ( Figure 9D ) . Also , Rab5 co - localized with 5 min internalized Hb ( Figure 9J ) , which is clearly separated from the Lysotracker Red - labeled perinuclear lysosomal compartment ( Figure 9M ) . Fig . 6 . Role of NSF - like protein in endosome fusion in Leishmania . ( A ) Cytosol prepared from Leishmania was treated with different concentrations of NEM ( 30 min at 4 (cid:176) C ) and excess NEM was quenched with 3 mM DTT . Fusion was carried out in an ATP - regenerating system containing NEM - treated cytosol . Fusion obtained in the absence of NEM was chosen as 1 U , and the results are expressed as relative fusion of three independent experiments 6 SD . One unit corresponds to 10 . 6 ng of HRP activity / mg of protein . ( B ) Endosome fusion was carried out in the presence of NSF - immunodepleted cytosol as indicated in Materials and methods . Fusion obtained with untreated cytosol was chosen as 1 U , and the results are expressed as relative fusion of three independent experiments 6 SD . One unit corresponds to 11 . 2 ng of HRP activity / mg of protein . Inset shows western blot analysis of Leishmania cell lysate ( 40 m g / lane ) with antibodies against mammalian NSF . Results from western blots are representative of three independent preparations . S . B . Singh et al . 5716 Discussion To understand the intracellular trafﬁcking of Hb in L . donovani promastigotes and its sorting in the early endocytic compartment , we have used an in vitro recon - stitution assay ( Gruenberg et al . , 1989 ) of endosomes isolated from Leishmania promastigotes using appropriate receptor - mediated or ﬂuid phase endocytic probes . The cell fractionation data and partial characterization of puriﬁed vesicles revealed that 5 min internalization of an appropriate endocytic probe speciﬁcally labeled early endosomes enriched in Rab5 and transferrin receptor , whereas 5 min internalization followed by 15 min chase speciﬁcally labeled late endosomes containing Rab7 , as observed in previous studies ( Gorvel et al . , 1991 ; Laurent et al . , 1998 ) . These results are in agreement with the ﬁndings that Rab5 - positive early endosomes regulate early events of endocytosis ( Gorvel et al . , 1991 ; Mukhopadhyay et al . , 1997a ) , whereas Rab7 , localized in late endosomes , serves as a targeting signal to the late compartment ( Feng et al . , 1995 ) . Our results show that several features of homotypic early endosome fusion in Leishmania are similar to fusion events described previously in mammalian cells ( Gruenberg et al . , 1989 ; Gorvel et al . , 1991 ) . Thus , early endosome fusion in Leishmania requires cytosol , ATP and its hydrolysis . A signiﬁcantly higher level of fusion between endosomes from Leishmania was observed at its optimal growth temperature of 23 (cid:176) C than at 37 (cid:176) C ( data not shown ) . This is not surprising since Dictyostelium , which grows optimally at 21 – 28 (cid:176) C , exhibits signiﬁcant fusion at a similar temperature ( Lenhard et al . , 1992 ) . It has been shown in several systems that Rab - GDI in the presence of GDP speciﬁcally depletes Rab proteins from the mem - Fig . 7 . Role of endocytic Rabs in endosome fusion in Leishmania . ( A ) Fusion between early endosomes containing BHb or AHRP was carried out in an ATP - regenerating system in the presence of untreated cytosol , LdRab7 - depleted cytosol , LdRab5 - depleted cytosol or LdRab5 - depleted cytosol supplemented with 500 ng of in vitro prenylated LdRab5 as described in Materials and methods . Fusion obtained with untreated cytosol was chosen as 1 U , and the results are expressed as relative fusion of three independent experiments 6 SD . One unit corresponds to 13 . 2 ng of HRP activity / mg of protein . Inset shows immunodepletion of Rab5 or Rab7 from Leishmania cytosol using speciﬁc antibodies . ( B ) AHRP - labeled early and late endosomes puriﬁed by sucrose density gradient were analyzed for the presence of early and late compartment - speciﬁc markers by western blot using speciﬁc antibodies ( TfR , transferrin receptor ) . ( C ) Fusion of early endosomes containing BHb with early or late endosomes containing AHRP was carried out in an ATP - regenerating system in the presence of cytosol . Similarly , fusion of early endosomes containing ﬂuid phase marker such as avidin was carried out with early or late endosomes containing BHRP . Fusion obtained between the early endosomes in the respective system was chosen as 1 U , and results are expressed as relative fusion of three independent experiments 6 SD . One unit corresponds to 15 . 2 and 12 . 8 ng of HRP activity / mg of protein in the fusion assay of early endosomes containing BHb and avidin , respectively . ( D ) Heterotypic fusion between BHb - loaded early endosomes and late endosomes containing AHRP was carried out in an ATP - regenerating system in the presence of untreated cytosol , LdRab5 - depleted cytosol , LdRab7 - depleted cytosol or LdRab7 - depleted cytosol supplemented with 500 ng of in vitro prenylated LdRab7 . Fusion obtained with untreated cytosol was chosen as 1 U , and results are expressed as relative fusion of three independent experiments 6 SD . One unit corresponds to 12 . 4 ng of HRP activity / mg of protein . Rab5 - regulated endosome fusion in Leishmania 5717 brane ( Funato et al . , 1997 ) and exhibits broad substrate speciﬁcity across species ( Attal and Langsley , 1996 ; Chaturvedi et al . , 1999 ) . In agreement with this , mamma - lian GDI along with GDP selectively stripped off Leishmania Rab protein from the endosomes , rendering them fusion incompetent , demonstrating the role of Rab proteins in this fusion . Another ubiquitous factor required for vesicle fusion in mammalian cells is NSF , a homohexamer having both ATP - binding and hydrolyzing activities ( May et al . , 2001 ) . The current model suggests that NSF in its ATP - bound state binds to the membrane through soluble NSF attachment protein ( SNAP ) , and ATP hydrolysis of NSF triggers rearrangement of v - SNARE and t - SNARE ( SNAP receptor ) , which actually mediate membrane fusion ( Chen and Scheller , 2001 ) . As NSF is an ATPase and because our ﬁndings that ATP g S and NEM treatment inhibit fusion of Leishmania endosomes , we explored the role of NSF - like protein in this fusion . NSF is reported to be well conserved among different organisms , and antibodies against NSF from one organism cross - react with others ( Weidenhaupt et al . , 1998 ) . Accordingly , in our study , anti - mammalian NSF antibody speciﬁcally recognizes an ~ 70 kDa protein in Leishmania , and fusion carried out in the presence of cytosol immunodepleted using this antibody is signiﬁ - cantly inhibited , demonstrating the role of NSF - like protein in endosome fusion in Leishmania . These results along with others suggest that , as in higher eukaryotic cells , an NSF - mediated SNARE complex is likely to regulate endocytosis in unicellular protozoa ( Chaturvedi et al . , 1999 ; Bogdanovic et al . , 2000 ) . Previous studies have shown that Rab5 regulates homotypic fusion between early endosomes . To determine the role of Rab5 in endosome fusion in Leishmania , we have cloned and expressed LdRab5 , which speciﬁcally binds GTP . However , GTPase activity of LdRab5 is lower than mammalian Rab5 . It has been shown that consensus sequences of Rabs in switch I ( IGVDF ) and switch II ( KLQIW ) regions are crucial for GTP hydrolysis and GDP / GTP exchange and this sequence is sensitive to alteration . The switch I and switch II regions of LdRab5 consist of VGASF and HFDIW , respectively , which may possibly explain the relatively low GTPase activity of LdRab5 as compared with its mammalian equivalent . However , LdRab5 contains RYKS and YYRGA , the signature motifs of the Rab subfamily ( Pereira - Leal and Seabra , 2000 ; Stenmark and Olkkonen , 2001 ) . Immunolocalization shows that Rab5 co - localizes with the 5 min internalized Hb - containing compartment , indi - cating that Rab5 in Leishmania is localized in an early endocytic compartment . Recently , it has been shown that LmRab7 localized in the perinuclear late endosome / lysosome compartment in L . mexicana ( Denny et al . , 2002 ) . Subsequently , LdRab5 , LdRab7 and speciﬁc anti - bodies were used to characterize endosome fusion in Leishmania . We observe that LdRab5 regulates fusion of BHb - loaded early endosomes with early endosomes containing AHRP from Leishmania , resembling the results of an earlier report ( Gorvel et al . , 1991 ) . However , early endosome fusion in Dictyostelium appears to be regulated by Rab7 , suggesting that Rab7 may couple both ends of the endocytic pathway in D . discoideum ( Laurent et al . , 1998 ) . It has been shown in different reconstitution systems that early endosomes are capable of homotypic fusion in vitro , whereas heterotypic fusion between early endosomes and late endosomes does not occur in vitro ( Gorvel et al . , 1991 ; Laurent et al . , 1998 ) . Similarly , early and late endosomes prepared from Leishmania promasti - gotes after ﬂuid phase uptake of avidin and BHRP , respectively , do not fuse as observed in other systems . In contrast , early endosomes containing a receptor - mediated endocytic probe , BHb , drive the fusion with both early and late compartments in Leishmania , and Rab7 regulates this heterotypic fusion . Several studies indicate that the signals for endocytosis and intracellular trafﬁcking often reside in the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor . For example , deletion of core kinase sequences from the distal region of the cytoplasmic Fig . 8 . Role of HbR cytoplasmic tail in heterotypic fusion in Leishmania . ( A ) Deletion mutants HbR - D C , HbR - D NC and HbR - D N , corresponding to the N - terminus , middle region and C - terminus of HbR , respectively , were expressed and puriﬁed as GST fusion proteins . ( B ) Puriﬁed HbR and deletion mutants ( 1 m g / lane ) were analyzed by western blot using anti - HbR polyclonal antibody ( top ) , monoclonal antibody , 1B6 ( middle ) and hemoglobin binding ( bottom ) as described in Materials and methods . ( C ) To determine the role of the HbR cytoplasmic domain , BHb - containing early endosomes were incubated with 1B6 , anti - LdRab5 antibody or the indicated deletion mutants of HbR ( 280 ng ) for 30 min at 4 (cid:176) C . Subsequently , late endosomes containing AHRP were added to treated early endosomes along with cytosol containing an ATP - regenerating system , and fusion was carried out as described in Materials and methods . Fusion obtained with untreated endosomes was chosen as 1 U , and the results are expressed as relative fusion of three independent experiments 6 SD . One unit corresponds to 12 . 6 ng of HRP activity / mg of protein . S . B . Singh et al . 5718 domain of the epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) receptor impaired proper trafﬁcking of the receptor to the late / lysosomal compartment ( Kornilova et al . , 1996 ) . Similarly , a sequence distal to the endocytic motif of cation - independent mannose 6 - phosphate receptor in the cytoplasmic tail is required for efﬁcient transport to late endosomes ( Juuti - Uusitalo et al . , 2000 ) . In addition , dendritic cells express DEC - 205 , an endocytic receptor - like macrophage mannose receptor ( MMR ) . However , unlike MMR , DEC - 205 receptor recycles from the late compartment and the targeting signal is localized in the distal region of the cytoplasmic tail ( Mahnke et al . , 2000 ) . Thus , it is tempting to speculate that the cytoplasmic tail of HbR projecting from the early endosome may transduce some signal ( s ) to mediate fusion with late endosomes in Leishmania . In order to prove unequivocally that the cytoplasmic domain of the HbR regulates heterotypic fusion , we have cloned and expressed different deletion mutants of HbR , which is a transmembrane protein having kinase activity ( data not shown ) . Topology prediction ( TMPred ; Hofmann and Stoffel , 1993 ) of HbR sequence and the observed maximum binding of Hb with HbR - D C suggest that possibly the N - terminus is the extracellular domain of Fig . 9 . Confocal images showing the localization of Rab5 in L . donovani promastigotes . Cells were ﬁxed in formaldehyde and Rab5 was visualized by anti - LdRab5 antibody and subsequently probed with goat anti - mouse Alexa Fluor 488 - labeled second antibody ( F , G , I , J , L and M ) as described in Materials and methods . Early endosomes were visualized by 5 min uptake of BHb , probed with avidin – Texas red ( H and J ) . Yellow indicates co - local - ization of Rab5 with Hb in early endosomes ( J ) . Nucleus ( Nu ) and kinetoplast ( K ) were labeled with propidium iodide ( E and G ) , and lysosome - like compartments were visualized by pre - incubating the promastigotes with Lysotracker Red ( K and M ) for 30 min at 23 (cid:176) C . The upper panel shows the phase image ( C ) of plasma membrane labeled with FM4 - 64 ( A ) and kinetoplast and nucleus stained with Syto green ( B and D ) . Fp indicates the ﬂagellar pocket . Rab5 - regulated endosome fusion in Leishmania 5719 HbR . Our results show that BHb - loaded early endosomes pre - treated with monoclonal antibody ( 1B6 ) , speciﬁc to the C - terminus of HbR , signiﬁcantly inhibit heterotypic fusion with late endosomes containing AHRP . Similarly , addition of HbR - D N in the fusion assay inhibited ~ 80 % of fusion , whereas no signiﬁcant inhibition was observed with HbR - D C or HbR - D NC . These results demonstrate that signal transduced from the HbR tail projecting from the early endosomal compartment is blocked by a C - terminus - speciﬁc antibody or competed by HbR - D N , indicating that the signal mediated through the C - terminal cytoplasmic tail of HbR may promote the fusion with late endosomes . In conclusion , our results represent the ﬁrst documen - tation that endocytosis in unicellular parasitic protozoa such as Leishmania is regulated by small GTP - binding proteins of the Rab family through vesicle fusion . Interestingly , our results have shown that early endosomes containing Hb in Leishmania fuse efﬁciently with both early and late compartments . We suggest that Hb in Leishmania ﬁrst moves to an early endosomal compart - ment where Rab5 - dependent rapid exchange between the endosomes occurs . Subsequently , Hb is targeted to the late / lysosomal compartment through signals mediated by the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor , which is Rab7 dependent . It will be interesting to determine the nature of signal ( s ) mediated through the receptor tail , which promotes heterotypic fusion between early endosomes and late endosomes in Leishmania . Materials and methods Materials Avidin , AHRP , N - hydroxy succicinimidobiotin ( NHS - Bio ) and bicinch - oninic acid ( BCA ) were purchased from Pierce Biochemicals ( Rockford , IL ) . Recombinant mammalian GDI and Rab5 constructs were kindly provided by Dr Philip Stahl ( Washington University School of Medicine , St Louis , MO ) . A mouse monoclonal anti - Rab5 antibody was received as a gift from Dr A . Wandinger - Ness ( Northwestern University , Evanston , IL ) . Alexa Fluor 488 , goat anti - mouse IgG and Lysotracker Red were purchased from Molecular Probes ( Eugene , OR ) . All HRP - labeled secondary antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology ( Santa Cruz , CA ) . Enhanced chemiluminescence ( ECL ) reagents were from Amersham Biosciences ( Amersham , UK ) . Unless otherwise stated , all other reagents were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co ( St . Louis , MO ) . Anti - Hb , anti - HbR and anti - NSF polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies were raised in mice by standard techniques ( Overkamp et al . , 1988 ; Celis et al . , 1994 ) . Hb was biotinylated using NHS - Bio as described previously ( Gruenberg et al . , 1989 ) . Cytosol was prepared from Leishmania using a procedure similar to that described previously ( Mukherjee et al . , 2000 ) . Cells Leishmania donovani promastigotes ( UR 6 ) were obtained from the Indian Institute of Chemical Biology , Kolkata , India . Cells were routinely maintained on blood agar slants containing glucose , peptone , sodium chloride , beef heart extract , rabbit blood and gentamycin ( Roy , 1932 ) . For experimental use , cells were harvested in phosphate - buffered ( 10 mM pH 7 . 2 ) saline ( 0 . 15 M ) from 3 - day - old slants . Cloning and expression of Rab5 homolog from L . donovani A putative Rab5 - like sequence with substantial homology to T . brucei Rab5B was identiﬁed from the L . major genome using BLAST . Accordingly , forward ( 5 ¢ - GGATCCATGTCATCCATCAGTCGC - 3 ¢ ) and reverse ( 5 ¢ - GAATTCCTAGCAGCATCCGTTCTCT - 3 ¢ ) primers were designed against the start and stop codons , respectively , of the putative Rab5 sequence of L . major . RT – PCR was performed using these primers to amplify the open reading frame of the putative Rab5 sequence using L . donovani cDNA . mRNA isolated from Leishmania promastigotes using an Oligotex mRNA kit ( Qiagen , Germany ) was used for cDNA synthesis using a Thermo Script RT – PCR kit ( Gibco - BRL ) as per the manufacturer’s instructions . Subsequently , PCR was performed using the above primers in a Perkin - Elmer thermocycler for 30 cycles : denaturation at 94 (cid:176) C for 3 min ; annealing at 55 (cid:176) C for 30 s ; and extension at 72 (cid:176) C for 1 min . The PCR product was cloned into pGEMT - easy vector ( Promega ) and sequenced using m13 universal primers in an automated sequencer . Subsequently , the PCR product was cloned into Bam HI – Eco RI sites of the pGEX - 4T - 2 vector ( Amersham Biosciences ) and transformed into Escherichia coli . Expression and puriﬁcation of LdRab5 Transformed E . coli were grown in LB and induced with 0 . 2 mM isopropyl - b - D - thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) for 3 h at 37 (cid:176) C for expression of GST – LdRab5 . Cells were harvested , lysed by sonication and lysate was treated with Triton X - 100 ( 1 % ) . Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 13 000 g for 10 min at 4 (cid:176) C . The fusion protein , GST – LdRab5 , was puriﬁed from the supernatant using reduced glutathione beads by standard procedures . Generation of antibodies against LdRab5 and LdRab7 GST – LdRab5 immobilized on glutathione beads was cleaved with 10 U of thrombin ( Pharmacia ) in cleavage buffer ( 50 mM Tris – HCl pH 7 . 5 containing 150 mM NaCl and 2 . 5 mM CaCl 2 ) for 3 h at 24 (cid:176) C , and beads were removed by centrifugation ( Smith and Corcoran , 1993 ) . After ensuring the purity of the released LdRab5 by SDS – PAGE , mice were immunized with this protein to raise antibodies by standard techniques ( Overkamp et al . , 1988 ) . We have also cloned and expressed Rab7 from L . donovani ( data not shown ) and raised antibody against LdRab7 using a similar procedure . The speciﬁcity of the antibodies against the respective proteins was determined by western blot analysis using Leishmania cell lysate . GTP overlay assay GTP binding of LdRab5 was detected in an overlay assay ( Via et al . , 1997 ) . Brieﬂy , different amounts of GST – LdRab5 and mammalian GST – Rab5 proteins blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with 1 m Ci / ml of [ a - 32 P ] GTP ( 3000 Ci / mM , NEN ) in 50 mM phosphate buffer pH 7 . 5 containing 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA and 0 . 3 % Tween - 20 , washed and visualized by autoradiography . GTPase assay The GTPase activity of LdRab5 was determined as described previously ( Stenmark et al . , 1994 ) . Brieﬂy , 2 pmol of immobilized Rab5 was incubated with buffer A ( 20 mM Tris – HCl pH 7 . 8 , 100 mM NaCl , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM Na - phosphate and 10 mM 2 - mercaptoethanol ) for 20 min at 25 (cid:176) C and bound nucleotides were eluted with 1 M guanidine - HCl . Immobilized proteins were then incubated with 2 pmol [ a - 32 P ] GTP ( 800 Ci / mmol , Perkin Elmer Life Sciences , MA ) in 20 m l of buffer A for 10 min at 0 (cid:176) C and incubated for various times at 23 (cid:176) C . Samples were washed and incubated in 8 m l of buffer B ( 0 . 2 % SDS , 2 mM EDTA , 10 mM GDP , 10 mM GTP pH 7 . 5 ) and heated for 2 min at 70 (cid:176) C . An aliquot was analyzed using thin - layer chromatography and visualized by autoradiography . Preparation of early endosomes from Leishmania Leishmania promastigotes were incubated with BHb ( 2 mg / ml ) in internalization medium ( MEM containing 10 mM HEPES and 5 mM glucose pH 7 . 4 ) for 5 min at 23 (cid:176) C , to label the early endosomal compartment . Internalization of BHb was stopped by adding cold medium , and cells were washed three times with cold homogenization buffer ( HB ; 20 mM HEPES , 250 mM sucrose and 2 mM EGTA , pH 7 . 2 containing protease inhibitors ) . Uninternalized BHb bound to the cells was quenched by incubating the cells with excess avidin ( 200 m g / ml ) at 4 (cid:176) C for 30 min . After washing with HB , 5 3 10 9 cells were resuspended in 12 ml of HB , equilibrated in a pre - cooled nitrogen cavitation bomb ( Parr Instrument company , IL ) with 750 p . s . i . N 2 for 25 min and disrupted by release of N 2 from the bomb ( Shapiro et al . , 1989 ) . The unbroken cells , nuclei and other cell debris were removed by low speed centrifugation at 500 g for 10 min at 4 (cid:176) C . The post - nuclear supernatant ( PNS ) was snap - frozen in liquid nitrogen . The enriched endosomal fraction from the PNS was prepared as described previously ( Mukherjee et al . , 2000 ) . Brieﬂy , thawed PNS was diluted with HB ( 1 : 3 ) and centrifuged at 20 000 g for 1 minat 4 (cid:176) C . The resultant supernatant was again centrifuged at 100000 g for 5 min at 4 (cid:176) C . The pellet enriched in early endosomal vesicles was used for in vitro fusion assays . Another set of endosomes containing AHRP was prepared similarly . S . B . Singh et al . 5720 Likewise , late endosomes were labeled by 5 min internalization followed by 15 min chase of AHRP or BHRP at 23 (cid:176) C . HRP - labeled enriched late endosomal vesicles were puriﬁed from the sucrose gradient as described below . Subcellular fractionation of L . donovani endocytic compartment To characterize the compartments labeled by 5 min internalization of AHRP by L . donovani promastigotes at 23 (cid:176) C , subcellular fractionation was carried out as described previously ( Laurent et al . , 1998 ) . Brieﬂy , cells were disrupted after internalization of AHRP and 0 . 5 ml of PNS was loaded onto a discontinuous sucrose density gradient formed by layering 0 . 35 ml of 54 % , 1 . 45 ml of 40 % and 1 . 45 ml of 30 % sucrose in HB . After centrifugation in an MLS 50 rotor ( Beckman TL100 ) at 100 000 g for 1 h at 4 (cid:176) C , 50 m l fractions were collected from the top of the gradient and samples were analyzed for the presence of HRP , 5 ¢ - nucleotidase activity ( Graham , 1993 ) and various compartment - speciﬁc markers . A similar fractionation was carried out using BHb as probe , and the presence of Hb in fractions was detected by western blot analysis using anti - Hb antibody . In vitro reconstitution of endosome fusion in Leishmania Reconstitution of fusion between endosomes prepared from Leishmania was carried out as described earlier ( Gorvel et al . , 1991 ) . Brieﬂy , two sets of endosomes containing BHb or AHRP were mixed in fusion buffer ( 250 mM sucrose , 0 . 5 mM EGTA , 20 mM HEPES - KOH pH 7 . 2 , 1 mM DTT , 1 . 5 mM MgCl 2 , 100 mM KCl , including an ATP - regenerating system , 1 mM ATP , 8 mM creatine phosphate , 31 U / ml creatine phosphokinase and 0 . 25 mg / ml avidin as scavenger ) supplemented with gel - ﬁltered ( G - 25 Sephadex ) cytosol prepared from Leishmania . Fusion was carried out for 1 h at 23 (cid:176) C and the reaction was stopped by chilling on ice . The membrane was solubilized in solubilization buffer ( SB ; PBS containing 1 % Triton X - 100 and 0 . 2 % methylbenzethonium chloride with 0 . 25 mg / ml avidin as scavenger ) , and BHb – AHRP complexes were immunoprecipitated using anti - Hb antibody . The HRP activity associated with the BHb – AHRP complex was measured as fusion units using O - phenylenediamine as chromogenic substrate ( Gruenberg et al . , 1989 ) . Fusion carried out in the absence of cytosol was low and was subtracted from the corresponding values to determine speciﬁc fusion . Maximum fusion obtained at 1 mg / ml cytosol concentration was expressed as 1 U of relative fusion . HRP activity corresponding to 1 U is speciﬁed in the ﬁgure legends . Immunodepletion of Leishmania cytosol using speciﬁc antibodies To deplete Rab5 from Leishmania cytosol , 100 m l of protein A / G plus – agarose ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) was incubated with 10 m l of anti - LdRab5 antibody in PBS overnight at 4 (cid:176) C . The antibody – protein A / G – agarose complex was washed and blocked with 1 mg / ml bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) for 1 h at 4 (cid:176) C . Subsequently , 600 m g of cytosol containing protease inhibitors was added to the protein A / G – agarose – anti - LdRab5 complex and incubated for 1 h at 4 (cid:176) C as described previously ( Mukherjee et al . , 2001 ) . Rab5 - depleted Leishmania cytosol was separated from the agarose beads by centrifugation . NSF - or Rab7 - depleted Leishmania cytosol was prepared similarly using the respective antibodies . Generation of HbR deletion mutants Recently we have cloned and expressed HbR from L . donovani ( data not shown ) . Different deletion mutants corresponding to the 5 ¢ end ( 1 – 378 bp ) , middle region ( 363 – 828 bp ) and 3 ¢ end ( 810 – 1383 bp ) of the gene were ampliﬁed by PCR using appropriate forward and reserve primers designed against the HbR sequence . These fragments were cloned into pGEMT - easy vector , sequenced and subcloned into pGEX - 4T - 2 vector . The GST fusion proteins , HbR - D C , HbR - D NC and HbR - D N , corresponding to the N - terminus , middle region and C - terminus of HbR , respectively , were expressed in E . coli and puriﬁed by standard procedure . Hemoglobin binding activity of HbR Puriﬁed HbR and different deletion mutants were subjected to SDS – PAGE ( 1 m g of each protein ) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane . After blocking with 5 % BSA and incubating with 1 m g / ml Hb , the membrane was incubated with anti - Hb antibody and subsequently probed with HRP - labeled secondary antibodies . Hb bound to various proteins was visualized by ECL . Immunolocalization of Rab5 in L . donovani In order to localize Rab5 in L . donovani promastigotes , cells were washed three times with PBS and ﬁxed in 4 % formaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at 4 (cid:176) C . Following the washes , thin smears of cells were prepared on glass slides and permeabilized with 0 . 4 % saponin for 20 min at 24 (cid:176) C . Subsequently , cells were incubated with 10 % fetal calf serum ( FCS ) to block non - speciﬁc binding , washed and probed with anti - LdRab5 antibody in PBS containing 0 . 4 % saponin for 30 min at 24 (cid:176) C . Cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 - labeled goat anti - mouse secondary antibody in the same buffer for 30 min at 24 (cid:176) C . Finally , the cells were washed and incubated for 15 min at 24 (cid:176) C with 5 m g / ml of propidium iodide to label the nucleus and kinetoplast . Similarly , early endosomes were labeled by 2 h binding of BHb at 4 (cid:176) C , washed , followed by 5 min uptake at 23 (cid:176) C and visualized by avidin – Texas red . Promastigotes were pre - incubated with Lysostracker Red ( 10 m M ) for 30 min at 23 (cid:176) C in PBS to label the lysosome - like compartment , before ﬁxing the cells . Slides were mounted with antifade reagents ( Molecular probes ) and viewed in an LSM 510 confocal microscope using an oil immersion objective .
