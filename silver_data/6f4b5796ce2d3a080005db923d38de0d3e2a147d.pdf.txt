However , the organization was unable to aggregate and visualize these data computationally . We present the Environmental Health Channel , an interactive web - based tool for visualizing environmental sensing and public health data . This tool enables discussing and dis - seminating scientiﬁc evidence to reveal local environmental and health impacts of industrial activities .

HCI ) ] : Miscellaneous Introduction and Related Work Air quality and its impacts on public health are critical envi - ronmental issues for residents who live near oil and gas de - velopment sites [ 5 ] . A vital step towards addressing these issues is through the collection and dissemination of con - vincing scientiﬁc evidence of these impacts [ 8 , 9 ] . However , conveying this evidence , especially with multiple types of data at a large temporal and geographic scale , requires the a r X i v : 1804 . 03263v1 [ c s . H C ] 9 A p r 2018 Figure 1 : The user interface of the Environmental Health Channel , which visualizes the analysis of air quality sensors . assistance of computational tools . In the pursuit of devel - oping a tool for this purpose , we collaborated with a local non - proﬁt organization that is working to study and assist communities that are potentially affected by oil and gas de - velopment . Since 2014 , the organization has collected data which includes ( 1 ) particulate measurements from air qual - ity sensors , ( 2 ) physical and psychosocial symptoms from surveys , and ( 3 ) personal stories from interviews . These citizen - contributed data were stored across multiple incom - patible systems , which hindered retrieving information , vi - sualizing trends , and disseminating ﬁndings . Moreover , the organization lacked the resources to independently develop computational tools for aggregating and visualizing data to facilitate user decision - making . Therefore , we collaborated with health professionals from the non - proﬁt organization to develop the Environmental Health Channel ( EHC ) , an inter - active web - based data visualization tool ( see Figure 1 ) . The goals were to ( 1 ) make citizen - contributed data explorable Figure 2 : When selecting health data by clicking on the top - left button in Figure 1 , the bottom parallel coordinate plot changes . through visualization , ( 2 ) enable users to communicate and share air quality issues with scientiﬁc evidence , and ( 3 ) em - power community members to make evidence - supported decisions . EHC enables exploring and sharing compelling scientiﬁc evidence of local environmental impacts of oil and gas drilling activities interactively . EHC is an interactive system that supports citizen sci - ence , where amateurs and professionals form partnerships through actual participation or collaboration in producing scientiﬁc knowledge [ 20 , 11 , 4 , 3 , 22 , 24 ] . Several exist - ing tools equip citizens with the capabilities to curate data and share data - driven scientiﬁc knowledge among stake - holders and community members . Creek Watch [ 15 ] is a mobile and web application tool for reporting images and descriptions about the local waterway condition to assist water management policymaking . Sensr [ 13 ] is a frame - work for creating mobile applications to collect and manage citizen - contributed data without coding skills . Tian et al . [ 27 ] , Kim et al . [ 14 ] , and Kuznetsov et al . [ 17 ] implemented air quality monitoring systems that measure particulate mat - ters with commercial or customized sensors and visualize these data in browsers or mobile applications . Our work is distinguished from these projects by two aspects . First , EHC provides scientiﬁc evidence from various perspectives by visualizing multiple types of data from air quality sen - sors , health surveys , and personal stories . Second , instead of showing raw data , EHC aggregates data temporally and geographically to enable comparing different local areas . System During system development , we collaborated with health professionals from the non - proﬁt organization in imple - menting system features . We began the design process by investigating the data types that the non - proﬁt organi - zation gathered from affected residents , as different data types require distinct visualization affordances . There were three data types : air quality metrics , self - reported health symptoms , and personal stories with images . Since 2014 , the non - proﬁt organization has provided portable air qual - ity sensors [ 25 , 26 ] to affected residents . After a month of placing sensors indoors and outdoors , the organization collected the sensors , computed air quality statistics from the raw sensor values , and presented these statistics to affected residents in report form . Also , affected residents ﬁlled out a self - reporting health survey to indicate physical and psychosocial symptoms that they experienced during the period when sensors were placed . The organization in - terviewed several affected residents about their personal stories of living near oil and gas drilling sites and collected photographs of their home environments . From these in - terviews , the organization created a series of photos with narrative text . Integrating the sensor , survey , and interview data into EHC posed privacy issues . To protect the pri - vacy of participants , we de - identiﬁed and aggregated data based on zip code boundaries . This approach addressed the concern that conﬁdentiality could be compromised by re - identiﬁcation of data . EHC stored these de - identiﬁed data in a Google Sheet , which enabled the stakeholders to work collaboratively on adding more citizen - contributed data in the future with ease without programming skills . To automate the process of updating data , a Python script on the server periodically parsed the Google Sheet data into suitable formats for each visualization . EHC permits reviewing and comparing aggregated data Figure 3 : The image slider of personal stories from residents . among different regions simultaneously . To enable inter - preting patterns and identifying key policy issues from mul - tiple types of data , we implemented a heatmap , a parallel coordinate plot , and a story slider in HTML / JavaScript . The heatmap ( see the top part of Figure 1 ) contains col - ored polygons to indicate zip code regions which contain air quality sensor data . A color legend ( see bottom - right of the map part of Figure 1 ) displays the relative color scale from green , yellow , orange , to red , which corresponds to - 1 , - 0 . 5 , 0 . 5 , and 1 standard deviation away from the mean value respectively . When users click on a colored zipcode , an in - formation window shows up to provide summary statistics of air quality data in the corresponding zip code region . The parallel coordinate plot [ 10 ] ( see the bottom part of Figure 1 ) displays the distribution of summary statistics describing air quality or health data . Each axis of the plot represents one statistic , such as the average number of air quality peaks per day . This plot allows users to visually compare relative values of a statistic across different zip code re - gions . For instance , when the number of peaks per day is selected ( see Figure 1 ) , red - colored zip code regions on the map have a relatively higher number of peaks per day than all other regions . Users can select a statistic by clicking on the corresponding label on the axis . The story slider ( see Figure 3 ) shows personal stories and images collected from interviews . This combined visual and narrative presenta - tion offers insight into personal experiences with oil and gas exposures and their involvement with air monitoring . Users can click on open - book icons on the heatmap to explore stories on the slider . Evaluation We conducted a 2 - hour focus group study [ 19 , 23 , 16 ] and applied afﬁnity diagramming [ 21 , 1 , 2 , 7 , 12 ] to gain insights about : ( 1 ) potential issues about system features and ( 2 ) affordances that EHC provided or would support in the fu - ture . Seven air quality experts were invited to discuss EHC with a software developer and three health professionals . We found that the discussion was centered around three themes found in previous research [ 6 , 17 , 18 , 14 , 15 , 13 ] : exploration , investigation , and advocacy . First , exploration refers to supporting the understanding of air quality vari - ables , data sources , and visualizations . For instance , par - ticipants mentioned the importance of providing instructions and explanations to users about the provided sensor statis - tics and the health variables . Participants also suggest that the color red should always indicate a qualitatively worse situation as it relates to potential health impacts , instead of a numerically higher value . Second , investigation per - tains to recognizing and comparing data patterns , forming hypotheses , and building narratives with evidence . For ex - ample , providing methods for simultaneously comparing health and air quality data is critical for allowing users to investigate the hypotheses that interest them . Additionally , participants recommended adding background variables , such as demographics , to provide more context and en - hance scientiﬁc evidence . Third , advocacy refers to val - idating data , taking actions with scientiﬁc evidence , and advocating for social impact and political change . For in - stance , as stories are compelling in evoking emotions and may leave users with the desire to take action , participants suggested adding resources at the end of the story slider to encourage community engagement . Moreover , participants pointed out that there is a need for abstracting data and vi - suals into concise and convincing reports that can easily be shared with stakeholders and raise the awareness of air quality issues . Discussion and Future Work EHC has been deployed in the local community affected by oil and gas development . Although EHC is being iteratively improved , it enables and encourages health professionals in the non - proﬁt organization to add , visualize , and share incoming data interactively among stakeholders and citi - zens without the assistance of computer scientists . With the help of air quality experts and health professionals , we have conducted a focus group study to understand issues about system features and determined possible future directions . The result supports the ﬁndings in previous research con - ducted by DiSalvo [ 6 ] , Kuznetsov [ 18 , 17 ] , and Kim [ 14 , 15 , 13 ] . As participants in this study were limited to experts , the result does not reﬂect the opinions of users with other lev - els of participation and expertise , such as residents or the general public . Future work will involve conducting more fo - cus group studies to receive feedback from a broader audi - ence . Moreover , we have not evaluated the impact of EHC on experts nor residents . Future research is needed to un - derstand motivations of participation and evaluate attitude changes after using EHC , such as changes in the aware - ness of air quality problems , conﬁdence in reaching goals , and sense of belonging in a community . We hope that this work will lay a foundation for researchers who develop in - formation technology that provides scientiﬁc evidence from multiple perspectives to empowers citizens .
