Summary Host cell invasion of the food - borne pathogen Campylobacter jejuni is one of the primary reasons of tissue damage in humans but molecular mechanisms are widely unclear . Here , we show that C . jejuni trig - gers membrane ruffling in the eukaryotic cell followed by invasion in a very speciﬁc manner ﬁrst with its tip followed by the ﬂagellar end . To pinpoint important signalling events involved in the C . jejuni invasion process , we examined the role of small Rho family GTPases . Using speciﬁc GTPase - modifying toxins , inhibitors and GTPase expression constructs we show that Rac1 and Cdc42 , but not RhoA , are involved in C . jejuni invasion . In agreement with these observations , we found that internalization of C . jejuni is accompanied by a time - dependent activa - tion of both Rac1 and Cdc42 . Finally , we show that the activation of these GTPases involves different host cell kinases and the bacterial ﬁbronectin - binding protein CadF . Thus , CadF is a bifunctional protein which triggers bacterial binding to host cells as well as signalling leading to GTPase activation . Collec - tively , our results suggest that C . jejuni invade host target cells by a unique mechanism and the activation of the Rho GTPase members Rac1 and Cdc42 plays a crucial role in this entry process . Introduction Campylobacter jejuni and related species are the major cause of human bacterial gastroenteritis , and may be responsible for as many as 400 – 500 million cases worldwide each year ( Friedman et al . , 2000 ) . Disease outcomes from C . jejuni infection vary from mild , non - inﬂammatory , self - limiting diarrhoea to severe , inﬂamma - tory , bloody diarrhoea lasting for several weeks ( Wassenaar and Blaser , 1999 ) . In addition , C . jejuni is also associated with the development of the peripheral neuropathies Miller – Fisher and Guillain – Barrè syndromes ( Nachamkin et al . , 1998 ; Yuki et al . , 2004 ) . A number of virulence - related properties of C . jejuni have been described , including bacterial motility ( Morooka et al . , 1985 ; Yao et al . , 1994 ) , chemotaxis ( Takata et al . , 1992 ; Yao et al . , 1997 ) , host cell attachment ( Monteville et al . , 2003 ) and toxin production ( Wassenaar , 1997 ) . Early studies of intestinal biopsies from patients and in vitro infection of cultured human intestinal epithelial cells have demonstrated that C . jejuni is able to invade gut tissue cells ( van Spreeuwel et al . , 1985 ; Oelschlaeger et al . , 1993 ; Ketley , 1997 ) . Since then , invasion of host target cells has been reported as one of the primary mechanisms of tissue damage caused by this pathogen . Numerous studies have provided evidence for unique microtubule - dependent ( actin ﬁlament - independent ) mechanisms by which C . jejuni invades gut tissue cells ( Oelschlaeger et al . , 1993 ; Hu and Kopecko , 1999 ) . In addition , the homologues of a type IV secretion system have been identiﬁed on a large plasmid ( pVir ) in C . jejuni 81 - 176 ( Bacon et al . , 2000 ) . Mutation of the pVir - encoded genes comB3 and virB11 resulted in reduced adhesion and invasion in vitro as compared with the parental wild - type ( wt ) strain ( Bacon et al . , 2002 ) .

Moreover , several C . jejuni adhesins have been described ; the best characterized are the periplasmic - binding protein PEB1 ( Pei et al . , 1998 ) and the outer membrane protein CadF ( Konkel et al . , 1997 ) . CadF enables C . jejuni to bind to ﬁbronectin for efficient attachment and invasion ( Monteville et al . , 2003 ; Krause - Gruszczynska et al . , 2007 ) , and appears to be involved in a signal transduction pathway leading to tyrosine phosphorylation of the focal adhesion protein paxillin . The cytolethal - distending toxin ( CDT ) is also con - sidered as an important C . jejuni virulence factor ( Hickey et al . , 2000 ) . The cdtB gene encodes the active subunit of CDT , exerting its effect as a nuclease that damages DNA ( Lara - Tejero and Galan , 2000 ) . It has been shown also that internalized bacteria colocalize speciﬁcally with microtubules and dynein ( Hu and Kopecko , 1999 ) . However , the mechanism by which C . jejuni are able to trigger eukaryotic cell entry is still poorly understood and very limited information is currently available concerning host cell factors involved in this process . Internalization of bacterial pathogens in general has typically been observed to induce rearrangement of the host actin - cytoskeletal structure caused by activation of small Rho family GTPases ( Hardt et al . , 1998 ; Tran Van Nhieu et al . , 1999 ; Criss et al . , 2001 ; Kazmierczak et al . , 2001 ; Cossart and Sansonetti , 2004 ; Rottner et al . , 2004 ) , but their importance and role in infections with C . jejuni has not been investigated yet . Members of the small Rho GTPases act as molecular switches that control a wide variety of signal transduction pathways in eukaryotic cells , including cellular actin dynamics . They cycle between a GDP - bound ( inactive ) state and GTP - bound ( active ) state , and , in the GTP - bound state , the GTPase relays extracel - lular signals to a large number of downstream effectors . RhoA , Rac1 and Cdc42 , the best - characterized members of the family , have distinct effects on the actin cytoskeleton ( Caron and Hall , 1998 ) . It has been proposed that Rho proteins are involved in formation of stress ﬁbres and focal adhesion complexes , whereas Rac1 triggers lamellipodia and membrane ruffling , and Cdc42 proteins induce ﬁlopo - dia formation ( Nobes and Hall , 1995 ) . However , in other actin - dependent processes such as bacterial invasion , a distinct subset of Rho GTPases becomes activated , often in a cell type - speciﬁc manner . For example , it has been demonstrated that Rac1 and Cdc42 play a crucial role in the invasion of Salmonella enterica and Shigella ﬂexneri ( Hardt et al . , 1998 ; Tran Van Nhieu et al . , 1999 ) , whereas RhoA is important for the uptake of Mycobacterium avium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( Sangari et al . , 2000 ; Kazimierczak et al . , 2001 ) . The growing number of known bacterial virulence factors acting on small Rho family GTPases comprises GEFs ( guanine nucleotide exchange factors ) and GAPs ( GTPase - activating proteins ) , which are capable of induc - ing localized signalling to actin rearrangement at the sites of bacterial invasion ( Cossart and Sansonetti , 2004 ; Rottner et al . , 2004 ) , or a novel class of type III effector proteins which mimic Rho GTPases ( Alto et al . , 2006 ) . In addition , numerous bacterial protein toxins are special - ized to activate , inhibit or modify Rho family GTPases ( Barbieri and Aktories , 2005 ) . For example , Clostridium difficile toxin B catalyses the glucosylation of Rho , Rac1 and Cdc42 at a speciﬁc threonine residue , causing their inactivation ( Just et al . , 1995 ) . Another example is the Clostridium botulinum toxin C3 ADP ribosyltransferase ( C3 toxin ) which is a speciﬁc inhibitor of RhoA , B and C ( Barbieri and Aktories , 2005 ) . Thus , conceptually , the latter toxins can modulate many aspects of actin - cytoskeletal function and provide a powerful tool to study the role of GTPases during the invasion of other pathogens . Since C . jejuni invades by a microtubule - dependent ( actin ﬁlament - independent ) mechanism into gut tissue cells ( Oelschlaeger et al . , 1993 ; Hu and Kopecko , 1999 ) , we asked whether this process differs from those of actin - dependent invasion mechanisms of other pathogens where small Rho family GTPases play an important role . For this purpose , we investigated the functional impor - tance of small Rho GTPase members and bacterial pathogenicity factors during host cell entry of C . jejuni . With the use of speciﬁc protein toxins , pharmacological inhibitors , GTPase constructs and GTPase activation assays we show for the ﬁrst time that infection of intestinal epithelial cells with C . jejuni induces the activation of small GTPase members Rac1 and Cdc42 which appear to be crucial regulators of C . jejuni invasion . Finally , we demonstrate that the bacterial ﬁbronectin - binding protein CadF plays a substantial role in this process . Results Campylobacter jejuni invasion of INT - 407 cells analysed by high - resolution ﬁeld emission scanning electron microscopy ( FESEM ) As a model system to study C . jejuni invasion , we used non - phagocytic intestinal epithelial cells ( INT - 407 ) and the C . jejuni strain 81 - 176 ( Hu and Kopecko , 1999 ; Biswas et al . , 2000 ; Konkel et al . , 2004 ; Hu et al . , 2005 ) . Many research laboratories worldwide use this clinical isolate as it exhibits a high level of invasion of INT - 407 cells and its entire genome sequence has been recently determined ( Hu and Kopecko , 1999 ; Hofreuter et al . , 2006 ; Hu et al . , 2006 ) . Analysis of the interaction of C . jejuni with the 2432 M . Krause - Gruszczynska et al . © 2007 The Authors Journal compilation © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd , Cellular Microbiology , 9 , 2431 – 2444 surface of INT - 407 epithelial cells by ﬁeld emission scan - ning electron microscopy ( FESEM ) revealed that the bac - teria were able to attach to the host cell surface , followed by cellular invasion of the C . jejuni which was observed predominantly after 4 – 6 h of infection ( Fig . 1A , red arrows ) . Interestingly , we found that the bacterium invaded into the cell in a very speciﬁc manner ﬁrst with its tip followed by the ﬂagellar end ( Fig . 1A and B , yellow arrowheads ) . Tight engulfment and membrane ruffles were also observed regularly , suggesting the occurrence of GTPase activation followed by dynamic membrane rearrangements during the invasion process ( Fig . 1B , blue arrows ) . Campylobacter jejuni invasion is time - dependent and associated with dynamic host actin - cytoskeletal rearrangements To determine the time frame required for C . jejuni to enter the eukaryotic cells , INT - 407 monolayers were infected for different time periods , ranging from 30 min to 24 h , and the number of intracellular bacteria was then determined by gentamicin protection assays ( Fig . 2A ) . The results indicated that penetration of C . jejuni into cultured cells occurred as early as 30 min after infection and that the number of intracellular bacteria increased rapidly between 4 and 6 h , in good agreement with the data obtained by FESEM . Intracellular persistence of C . jejuni could be shown by the fact that the number of intracellular bacteria even increased during 24 h infections . However , survival of the internalized C . jejuni past 24 h could not be assessed because the infected INT - 407 cells started detaching after this time period . The data obtained with the gentamicin protection assays and FESEM were then conﬁrmed by confocal microscopy examination . For example , INT - 407 cells infected with GFP - expressing C . jejuni also revealed numerous intracellular bacteria ( Fig . 2B – E , arrows ) . Interestingly , immunoﬂuorescence ( IF ) staining with rhodamine - conjugated phalloidin indicated condensation of actin ﬁlaments associated with the attached bacteria ( Fig . 2B – E , arrows ) . This result is consistent with previous observations ( Konkel et al . , 1992 ; Monteville et al . , 2003 ) . In addition , a signiﬁcant proportion of intracellular C . jejuni was also observed to be closely associated with con - densed patches of host ﬁlamentous actin ( Fig . 2F – H , arrowheads ) . These ﬁndings support the view , in addition to previous reported microtubule - dependent invasion , that C . jejuni induces actin - cytoskeletal rearrangements and Rho GTPase activation . Inactivation of Rac and Cdc42 , but no Rho , prevents C . jejuni internalization To investigate whether small Rho GTPases play a role in the uptake of C . jejuni , we ﬁrst incubated INT - 407 cells with the pharmacological inhibitor compactin which inac - tivates GTPases by blocking their isoprenylation and membrane targeting ( Chong et al . , 1994 ) . Indeed , expo - sure of INT - 407 cells to compactin signiﬁcantly reduced C . jejuni internalization as quantiﬁed by gentamicin pro - tection assays ( Fig . 3A ) . Next , we treated the cells with Fig . 1 . High - resolution ﬁeld emission scanning electron microscopy of C . jejuni invasion into INT - 407 epithelial cells . ( A ) C . jejuni 81 - 176 ( red arrows ) infected for 4 – 6 h were able to induce their entry into the eukaryotic target cells and ( B ) were often associated with membrane ruffles ( blue arrows ) and tight engulfment of the bacteria . We found that the bacteria invaded into the cell ﬁrst with their tip followed by the other end carrying the ﬂagella ( yellow arrowheads ) . The bar in each ﬁeld corresponds to 1 m m . Role of Rho GTPases and CadF in Campylobacter jejuni invasion 2433 © 2007 The Authors Journal compilation © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd , Cellular Microbiology , 9 , 2431 – 2444 toxin B from C . difficile prior to bacterial infection . Toxin B is a protein that monoglucosylates Rho , Rac and Cdc42 , leading to their irreversible inactivation in a very efficient manner ( Barbieri and Aktories , 2005 ) . As expected , in the presence of toxin B , INT - 407 cells started rounding up and actin structures were disrupted ( data not shown ) , leading to profound inhibition of C . jejuni internalization in a dose - dependent manner , as determined by gentamicin protec - tion assays and confocal microscopy ( Fig . 3A ; and data not shown ) . It is noteworthy that the number of bacteria bound to epithelial cells was also signiﬁcantly increased in both the toxin B - treated samples as compared with the control ( Fig . 3A ) . However , this is not surprising as the toxins markedly altered the morphology of the INT - 407 cells in a manner that should improve bacterial access to the basolateral pole , where C . jejuni binding ( and internal - Fig . 2 .

Importantly , toxin B had no effect on bac - terial viability , as indicated by the cell - associated C . jejuni colony - forming units ( cfu ) ( data not shown ) . Similar results were obtained with TcdB toxin which expresses similar inactivating activities on Rho , Rac and Cdc42 ( Fig . 3B ) . To further elucidate which GTPases are involved in C . jejuni invasion , another variant of toxin B from C . difficile strain 1470 serotype F ( TcdBF ) was applied which inactivates Rac and R - Ras but not Rho and Cdc42 ( Chaves - Olarte et al . , 2003 ) . Interestingly , TcdBF also had a pronounced blocking effect ( Fig . 3B ) . These results suggest that Rac but not Rho is involved in the entry process of C . jejuni . To conﬁrm this idea , we utilized exoenzyme C3 from C . botulinum which speciﬁcally inac - tivates RhoA – C ( Genth et al . , 2003 ) and CNF - Y , a speciﬁc activator of RhoA ( Hoffmann and Schmidt , 2004 ; Hoff - mann et al . , 2004 ) . Treatment of INT - 407 cells with the cell - permeable C3 fusion protein for 6 h resulted in the complete loss of stress ﬁbres consistent with inhibition of Rho ( Genth et al . , 2003 and data not shown ) . Infection of INT - 407 cells pre - treated with C3 led to a slight increase of bacterial binding but did not block C . jejuni internaliza - tion ( Fig . 3A ) . In agreement with these results , increased internalization of C . jejuni was not observed by activation of RhoA using CNF - Y ( Fig . 3A ) , excluding a role of RhoA – C in this effect . The latter result further excludes the possibility that the reduced C . jejuni invasion was due to mere changes of actin dynamics . To conﬁrm that Rac1 and Cdc42 activity was required for bacterial internalization , INT - 407 cells were transiently transfected with the dominant - negative ( DN ) alleles of Rac1 ( Rac1 - T17N ) or Cdc42 ( Cdc42 - T17N ) . Transfection of INT - 407 cells with both DN - Rac1 and DN - Cdc42 resulted in a signiﬁcantly reduced C . jejuni invasion as determined by gentamicin protection assays ; expression of either DN - Rac1 or DN - Cdc42 alone was less effective ( Fig . 4A and B ) . In conclusion , Rac1 and Cdc42 were required for the internalization of C . jejuni . Activation of Rac and Cdc42 , but not RhoA , promotes C . jejuni internalization To show that activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 trigger bacte - rial invasion , INT - 407 cells were transfected with c - Myc - tagged constitutively active ( CA ) mutant alleles of Rac1 ( Rac1 - Q61L ) , Cdc42 ( Cdc42 - Q61L ) and RhoA ( RhoA - G14V ) , and the empty vector as a control . After 48 h , the transfected cells were infected with C . jejuni for another 6 h and intracellular bacteria were quantiﬁed by gentami - cin protection assays ( Fig . 4C ) . The most pronounced effect was observed with CA - Rac1 whose expression Fig . 4 . Effect of expression of dominant - negative and constitutively active forms of Rho GTPases on C . jejuni uptake .

Role of Rho GTPases and CadF in Campylobacter jejuni invasion 2435 © 2007 The Authors Journal compilation © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd , Cellular Microbiology , 9 , 2431 – 2444 stimulated C . jejuni internalization about 4 . 7 - fold as com - pared to the empty vector control ( P = 0 . 003 , Student’s t - test ) . A moderate effect was seen with CA - Cdc42 ( about 1 . 7 - fold increase ) which was also statistically signiﬁcant ( P = 0 . 011 ) . In agreement with the data obtained with CNF - Y toxin , expression of CA - RhoA resulted in a signiﬁ - cant decrease of C . jejuni internalization ( P = 0 . 003 , Fig . 4C ) . Similar expression of each of the CA - GTPase proteins in the assays was conﬁrmed by immunoblotting using an a - c - Myc antibody with GAPDH as a control ( Fig . 4D ) . Thus , activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 but not RhoA is most likely to govern C . jejuni invasion . Rac1 and Cdc42 regulate the internalization of C . jejuni as determined by confocal microscopy To reveal by another more direct approach whether the activity of Rac1 and Cdc42 is crucial for the cellular entry of C . jejuni , we have analysed the presence of internal - ized bacteria by confocal microscopy , in 50 individual INT - 407 cells , each overexpressing the DN - or CA - GTPase proteins respectively ( Fig . 5 ) . Internalized GFP - expressing C . jejuni were detected within multiple non - transfected cells of the ﬁeld ( data not shown ) . In contrast , C . jejuni were rarely found internalized into either Rac1 - T17N - or Cdc42 - T17N - expressing cells ( Fig . 5A and C , respectively ) . Instead , internalized bacte - ria were prominently observed in both Rac1 - Q61L - and Cdc42 - Q61L - expressing INT - 407 cells in a statistically signiﬁcant manner ( Fig . 5B and D , respectively ) . The quantiﬁcation data are shown in Fig . 5E . Thus , activated Rac1 and Cdc42 positively regulate the uptake of C . jejuni in INT - 407 epithelial cells . Campylobacter jejuni internalization is accompanied by activation of endogenous Rac1 and Cdc42 To test whether the activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 occurs during infection with C . jejuni , pull - down assays were per - formed . Particularly , GTP loading onto Rac1 and Cdc42 was determined by speciﬁc binding of the active GTPase to the Cdc42 - Rac1 interactive binding domain of PAK1 fused to glutathione S - transferase ( GST – CRIB ) ( Sander et al . , 1998 ) . Positive and negative controls were carried out with GTP g - S and GDP , respectively ( data not shown ) . Monolay - ers of INT - 407 cells were infected with C . jejuni for different Fig . 5 .

Lysates were prepared , and the amount of GTP - loaded Rac1 and Cdc42 was determined . As shown in Fig . 6A – C , prominent activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 in INT - 407 cells was detected between 2 and 4 h after infec - tion . These results are consistent with the ﬁnding that high rates of C . jejuni - induced membrane ruffling and invasion can be detected as soon as 4 – 6 h after infection ( Figs 1 – 5 ) . Moreover , they further support our hypothesis that activation of both Rac1 and Cdc42 activity is biologically relevant to C . jejuni internalization . Identiﬁcation of kinases involved in C . jejuni - induced activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 To elucidate signalling pathways leading to C . jejuni - induced activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 , several kinase inhibitors were applied . In previous studies , treatment with numerous kinase inhibitors resulted in a decrease of C . jejuni invasion ( Wooldridge et al . , 1996 ; Biswas et al . , 2004 ; Hu et al . , 2006 ) . In agreement with these results , we observed that invasion of C . jejuni was signiﬁcantly reduced in the presence of the kinase inhibitors genistein , tyrphostin - 46 , wortmannin or staurosporine ( Fig . 7A ) .

Role of Rho GTPases and CadF in Campylobacter jejuni invasion 2437 © 2007 The Authors Journal compilation © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd , Cellular Microbiology , 9 , 2431 – 2444 test if the latter effect is based on inhibition of Rac1 and Cdc42 activation , INT - 407 cells pre - treated with the inhibi - tor were infected with C . jejuni for 2 h . Rac1 and Cdc42 activity was then assessed by CRIB pull - down assay as described above . Genistein , a broad - spectrum inhibitor of tyrosine kinases , had no signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the acti - vation of Rac1 - GTP ( Fig . 7B and D ) but it reduced the levels of Cdc42 - GTP ( Fig . 7C and D ) . Furthermore , tyrphostin - 46 , a inhibitor of EGFR , p56 Lck and PDGFR , and wortmannin , an inhibitor of PI - 3 kinase , completely blocked the activation of Cdc42 but not Rac1 during infec - tion with C . jejuni ( Fig . 7 ) . Thus , the genistein - / tyrphostin - / wortmannin - mediated decrease in bacterial cell entry may be based on reduced Cdc42 activation . Staurosporine , a potent broad - spectrum inhibitor of serine / threonine kinases , which also reduced bacterial uptake , completely inhibited the activation of both Rac1 and Cdc42 , which may account for the reduced bacterial uptake . Although we cannot fully rule out pleiotropic effects of the inhibitors , our data suggest that the EGF and the PDGF receptor , p56 Lck , PI - 3 kinase , and several tyrosine kinases are involved in C . jejuni - induced activation of Cdc42 but not Rac1 , while serine / threonine kinases appear to be involved in the activation of both Rac1 and Cdc42 . Activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 by C . jejuni involves the ﬁbronectin - binding protein CadF Finally , we attempted to identify or exclude bacterial factors involved in C . jejuni - induced GTPase activation . For this purpose , we employed ﬁve isogenic mutants of C . jejuni pathogenicity factors : CadF , KpsS , WaaF , PEB1 and CDT ( Table 1 ) . While almost no difference in acti - vation of Rac1 and Cdc42 was observed with the 81 - 176 D cdtB and 84 - 25 D waaF mutants , infection with 84 - 25 D kpsS and 81 - 176 D PEB1A mutants slightly enhanced the activation of the GTPases when com - pared with their respective wt strains ( Table 1 ) . Interest - ingly , the virulence plasmid - free C . jejuni strains 84 - 25 and F38011 ( see Experimental procedures ) activated Rac1 and Cdc42 as efficiently as the pVir - carrying strain 81 - 176 , indicating that pVir is not involved in the signal - ling upstream of GTPases ( Table 1 ) . Reduced activation of Rho GTPases was observed in cells infected with the F38011 D cadF mutant strain ; this strain less efficiently activated Rac1 ( 68 % compared with wt ) and Cdc42 ( 37 % compared with wt ) ( Fig . 8C – E , Table 1 ) . The acti - vation of Rho GTPases correlated with the association of CadF - positive C . jejuni to the cells and their internal - ization into INT - 407 cells , which was signiﬁcantly higher as compared with the isogenic cadF mutant ( Fig . 8A and B ) . Thus , the ﬁbronectin - binding protein CadF most likely plays a role in the activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 . However , CadF does not appear to be the sole factor involved in GTPase activation and invasion of C . jejuni . The CadF mutant was still able to induce some GTPase activation suggesting that other bacterial factor ( s ) are also implicated ( Fig . 8C – E ) . Discussion Host cell invasion is an important process in the patho - genesis of many bacteria and involves numerous steps : bacterial binding at speciﬁc receptor sites , signalling to the host cell , modiﬁcation of intracellular host signal trans - duction pathways , membrane and cytoskeletal rearrange - ments , and eventual engulfment of the bacterium , which commonly involves the activity of one or more of the small Table 1 .

Krause - Gruszczynska et al . © 2007 The Authors Journal compilation © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd , Cellular Microbiology , 9 , 2431 – 2444 Rho family GTPases ( Cossart and Sansonetti , 2004 ; Rottner et al . , 2004 ) . Rho family members , including Rac1 , Cdc42 and RhoA , are small GTP - binding proteins that induce a variety of host cell responses ( Nobes and Hall , 1995 ; Caron and Hall , 1998 ; Tran Van Nhieu et al . , 1999 ; Cossart and Sansonetti , 2004 ) . These Rho family GTPases serve as guanine nucleotide - regulated switches that transduce external stimuli to modulate different cel - lular functions ( Nobes and Hall , 1995 ; Caron and Hall , 1998 ; Tran Van Nhieu et al . , 1999 ; Cossart and San - sonetti , 2004 ) . Microtubule - dependent host cell entry by C . jejuni is considered as one of the primary reasons for bacterial - caused tissue damage ; however , the molecular mechanisms of C . jejuni invasion are widely unknown . Here , we show that the food - borne pathogen C . jejuni enters host target cells in a very speciﬁc manner and demonstrate that Rac1 and Cdc42 and the bacterial ﬁbronectin - binding protein CadF play a crucial role in C . jejuni internalization . We found that C . jejuni invasion of INT - 407 cells depended on the activation of both Rac1 and Cdc42 . Inhibition of endogenous Rho family members by com - pactin , toxin B , TcdB , TcdBF and the transient transfec - tion of DN - Rac1 or DN - Cdc42 , effectively reduced the uptake of C . jejuni , suggesting an involvement of these proteins in the invasion process . In turn , internalization of C . jejuni was enhanced by the transient expression of CA - Rac1 and / or CA - Cdc42 with CA - Rac1 being more effective than CA - Cdc42 . These ﬁndings suggest that Rac1 is the major player regulating host cell internaliza - tion of C . jejuni . Host cell invasion of numerous pathogens , including S . ﬂexneri and S . enterica , is accompanied by extensive membrane ruffling and requires different Rho GTPases including Rac1 and Cdc42 , which are regulated directly through bacterial factors injected into the host cell by a type III secretion system ( ‘trigger mechanism’ ) ( Hardt et al . , 1998 ; Tran Van Nhieu et al . , 1999 ; Cossart and Sansonetti , 2004 ) . However , other than the ﬂagella , C . jejuni does not encode a classical type III secretion system ( Konkel et al . , 1999 ; Hofreuter et al . , 2006 ) . Our electron microscopic studies support the view that C . jejuni did not enter host cells by a classical trigger - like mechanism . Thus , it is tempting to speculate that other pathogenicity factors such as plasmid pVir , CDT , KpsS , WaaF , PEB1 or CadF may be involved in C . jejuni - induced GTPase activation . Interestingly , wt C . jejuni strains , like 84 - 25 and F38011 , which lack pVir , induced activation of Rho GTPases , suggesting that pVir and the encoded factors ComB3 and VirB11 are not involved in the invasion of C . jejuni 81 - 176 into host cells ( Bacon et al . , 2000 ; 2002 ) . The CPS and LOS biosynthesis genes Fig . 8 . Importance of CadF expression on C . jejuni - induced activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 and host cell invasion . INT - 407 cells were infected with isogenic F38011 D cadF mutant versus wt F38011 for 6 h at 37°C . A . The expression of CadF proteins during infection was veriﬁed by immunoblotting using the a - CadF antibody . B . Total and intracellular Campylobacter cells were quantiﬁed by gentamicin protection assay [ P (cid:2) 0 . 05 ( * ) and P (cid:2) 0 . 005 ( * * ) ] . Cell lysates were prepared from infected and non - infected cells , and incubated with a GST – CRIB fusion protein as described . C and D . The presence of bound ( C ) active Cdc42 - GTP or ( D ) Rac1 - GTP was analysed by Western blotting using a - Rac1 and a - Cdc42 antibodies respectively . Similar quantities of individual GTPase proteins in each lane were conﬁrmed by Western blotting using equivalent volumes of cell lysates . E . Quantiﬁcation of Rac1 and Cdc42 GTPase activities during the course of infection . One hundred per cent of activity corresponds to the highest amount of detected GTPase - GTP levels . Role of Rho GTPases and CadF in Campylobacter jejuni invasion 2439 © 2007 The Authors Journal compilation © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd , Cellular Microbiology , 9 , 2431 – 2444 kpsS and waaF have been shown previously to be impli - cated in C . jejuni invasion ( Karlyshev et al . , 2000 ; Bacon et al . , 2001 ; Kanipes et al . , 2004 ) . We found that their respective isogenic mutants activated Rho GTPases comparable to wt C . jejuni , suggesting that kpsS and waaF genes may have other functions during the invasion process . In addition , we observed that inactivation of the important bacterial adhesin PEB1 even enhanced C . jejuni - induced Rac1 and Cdc42 activation , suggesting that bacterial binding to host cells per se does not trigger GTPase activation . Importantly , we found that an isogenic cadF mutant less efficiently induced activation of Rho GTPases compared with wt bacteria . This suggests that CadF , at least in part , is involved in Rac1 / Cdc42 activation . Because CadF is a well - described ﬁbronectin - binding protein , we propose that CadF is a bifunctional protein . CadF does not only act as a canonical adhesin for bacterial binding to ﬁbronectin but could also stimulate integrins and growth factor receptor clustering , which sub - sequently activates downstream factors such as GEFs of Rac1 and Cdc42 . Our inhibitor studies were in full agree - ment with the ﬁnding that CadF is involved in signalling leading to GTPase activation . The inhibitor studies showed that Rac1 and Cdc42 are activated by at least two signalling pathways . The activa - tion of Cdc42 but not Rac1 was entirely blocked by tyrphostin - 46 and wortmannin , suggesting that growth factor receptors and PI - 3 kinase play a crucial role in the C . jejuni - induced activation of Cdc42 . This indicates that Cdc42 is likely activated by a classical growth factor receptor ( e . g . EGFR or PDGFR ) and PI - 3 kinase - dependent pathway , but this needs to be investigated in future studies . Importantly , both inhibitors had almost no effect on the activation of Rac1 . This is remarkable as most of the known signalling pathways leading to the activation of Rac1 are PI - 3 kinase - dependent ( Rottner et al . , 2004 ) . The only known exception was shown for a PI - 3 kinase - independent pathway involving Tiam1 , a spe - ciﬁc GEF for Rac1 . Interestingly , the interaction between Tiam1 and the Arp2 / 3 complex links activation of Rac1 to actin polymerization ( Ten Klooster et al . , 2006 ) and the intrinsic exchange factor activity speciﬁc for Rac1 is enhanced by threonine phosphorylation of Tiam1 ( Michiels et al . , 1997 ; Fleming et al . , 1999 ; 2000 ) . In agreement with this hypothesis , we observed that the activation of Rac1 is entirely blocked by staurosporine , a well - known inhibitor of threonine and serine kinases . Thus , we hypothesize that C . jejuni CadF may activate Rac1 by a pathway involving serine and threonine kinases and Tiam1 . The latter conclusions are consistent with previous inhibitor studies , demonstrating that C . jejuni entry into host target cells ( as measured by gentamicin protection assays ) is blocked by inhibitors including genistein , tyrphostin - 46 , staurosporine or wortmannin ( Wooldridge et al . , 1996 ; Biswas et al . , 2000 ; 2004 ; Hu et al . , 2006 ) . However , how activated Rac1 and Cdc42 potentially regulate the downstream C . jejuni invasion pathway needs to be elucidated in future studies . In other systems , targets of both Rac1 and Cdc42 may include PAK ( Cossart and Sansonetti , 2004 ; Rottner et al . , 2004 ) . Upon binding to either GTP - bound Rac1 or Cdc42 , PAK undergoes autophosphorylation on multiple sites and is activated . PAK function in vivo includes activation of the JNK / SAPK , p38 MAP kinase and LIM kinase pathways . Recent studies demonstrated the activation of the Erk and p38 MAP kinase pathways during C . jejuni infection ( Watson and Galan , 2005 ; Hu et al . , 2006 ) . All of these processes potentially stimulate localized membrane dynamics and C . jejuni uptake . Another interesting ﬁnding in this study is that expres - sion of CA - RhoA ( RhoA - G14V ) reduced C . jejuni invasion . Numerous studies have shown that CA - RhoA or endogenous RhoA activation inhibited Rac1 activation in neurons ( Yamaguchi et al . , 2001 ; Negishi and Katoh , 2002 ) and CHO cells ( Sugimoto et al . , 2003 ) . Activation of Rho kinase by RhoA induces phosphorylation and activa - tion of myosin , located at the cell periphery , and conse - quently elevates contractile activity of actomyosin , enhancing the stabilization of cortical actin ﬁlaments . This stabilization disturbs the Rac1 - mediated reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton at the cell periphery and subse - quent protrusion ( Negishi and Katoh , 2002 ) . Thus , acti - vated RhoA may block Rac1 resulting in blocking of C . jejuni host cell entry . Taken together , the work presented here demonstrates several lines of evidence for a clear role for Rac1 and Cdc42 during host cell entry of three different isolates including the C . jejuni model strain 81 - 176 . These ﬁndings add another important aspect to our understanding of the mechanism of C . jejuni pathogenesis . As the exact pathway of C . jejuni invasion into host target cells is not fully clear , it will be highly interesting to study in the future the precise mechanisms of how C . jejuni CadF induces activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 to regulate actin rearrange - ment and / or microtubule dynamics involved in the bacte - rial entry process . Experiments are underway in our laboratory to investigate these signalling pathways in more detail . Experimental procedures Bacterial strains and INT - 407 cells All C . jejuni wt and mutant strains used in this study are pre - sented in Table 1 . In addition , the C . jejuni 81 - 176 wt strain was transformed with the pWM1007 - gfp vector ( Miller et al . , 2000 ) . All C . jejuni strains were grown on Campylobacter blood - free selec - tive Agar Base ( Oxoid ) containing Campylobacter growth supple - ment ( Oxoid ) or , when appropriate , on Mueller – Hinton ( MH ) agar 2440 M . Krause - Gruszczynska et al . © 2007 The Authors Journal compilation © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd , Cellular Microbiology , 9 , 2431 – 2444 amended with 200 m g ml - 1 kanamycin at 37°C under microaero - bic conditions ( generated by CampyGen , Oxoid ) for 48 h . The presence or absence of plasmids such as pVir was evaluated by standard plasmid preparations and PCR as described ( Bacon et al . , 2000 ; 2002 ) . Human embryonic intestinal epithelial cells ( INT - 407 ) , obtained from the American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC CCL - 6 ) , were grown in Eagle’s minimum essential medium ( MEM ) containing L - glutamine and Earle’s salts ( Gibco ) , 100 units ml - 1 penicillin , 100 m g ml - 1 streptomycin and 10 % fetal bovine serum ( Gibco ) in a humidiﬁed 5 % CO 2 incubator . Infection studies For the infection assays , INT - 407 cells were seeded to give 4 ¥ 10 5 cells in 12 - well tissue culture plates . The culture medium was replaced with fresh MEM without antibiotics 1 h before infection . Bacteria were suspended in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS , pH 7 . 4 ) , added to the cells at a multiplicity of infection ( moi ) of 200 and co - incubated with INT - 407 for the indicated periods of time . Transfection experiments Transfection of GTPase constructs containing cDNAs of consti - tutively active mutants ( Rac1 - Q61L , RhoA - G14V and Cdc42 - Q61L ) or dominant - negative mutants ( Rac1 - T17N , RhoA - T19N and Cdc42 - T17N ) were performed using GeneJammer transfec - tion reagent ( Stratagene ) . After 48 h , transfected INT - 407 cells were infected with C . jejuni . All constructs were expressed as N - terminal c - Myc fusion proteins from plasmid pRK5 and were kindly provided by Dr L . Machesky ( Caron and Hall , 1998 ) . The N - terminal GFP fusion construct of Cdc42 - T17N was a gift of Dr Ilan Rosenshine ( Ben - Ami et al . , 1998 ) . The efficiency of trans - fection was veriﬁed both by IF staining in confocal microscopy and Western blotting using an a - c - Myc antibody ( hybridoma clone 9E10 from ATCC ) or a - GFP antibody ( Pharmingen ) . Gentamicin protection assay Infection of INT - 407 cells at a density of 4 ¥ 10 5 cells per well was carried out as described above . After infection , the cells were washed three times with 1 ml of pre - warmed MEM medium per well to remove non - adherent bacteria . To determine the cfu cor - responding to intracellular bacteria , the INT - 407 cell monolayers were treated with 250 m g ml - 1 gentamicin ( Sigma ) at 37°C for 2 h , washed three times with medium , and then incubated with 1 ml of 0 . 1 % ( w / v ) saponin ( Sigma ) in PBS at 37°C for 15 min . The treated monolayers were re - suspended thoroughly , diluted and plated on MH agar . To determine the total cfu corresponding to host - associated bacteria , the infected monolayers were incu - bated with 1 ml of 0 . 1 % ( w / v ) saponin in PBS at 37°C for 15 min without prior treatment with gentamicin . The resulting suspen - sions were diluted and plated as described above . For each strain , the level of bacterial adhesion and uptake was determined by calculating the number of cfu . All experiments were routinely performed in triplicates . In parallel control experiments , 250 m g ml - 1 gentamicin killed all extracellular bacteria ( data not shown ) . Inhibitor studies For uptake inhibition and activation studies , INT - 407 cells in 1 ml of medium were pre - treated with 1 m g cell - permeable C3 toxin ( C2IN - C3 together with C2II ; Genth et al . , 2003 ) , 350 ng of CNF - Y for 30 min , 2 – 6 ng of toxin B , TcdB or TcdBF for 2 h or 50 m M compactin ( Calbiochem ) for 16 h at 37°C . Cloning and puriﬁcation of toxins CNF - Y and toxin B was described elsewhere ( Just et al . , 1995 ; Hoffmann et al . , 2004 ) . Subsequent infection with C . jejuni was carried out as described above . After infection , INT - 407 cells were washed three times with pre - warmed MEM medium to remove non - adherent bacteria and then subjected to cell adhesion and invasion assays or were ﬁxed with 3 . 8 % ( v / v ) paraformaldehyde in PBS . The ﬁxed cell samples were subjected to IF staining and confocal microscopy . All pharmacological inhibitors ( Calbiochem ) used in Fig . 7 were added to the cells 30 min prior to infection . We have carefully checked the viability of cells in every experiment to exclude toxic effects resulting in loss of host cells from the monolayers . The following inhibitor concentrations were used : 250 m M genistein ( Wooldridge et al . , 1996 ; Biswas et al . , 2004 ; Hu et al . , 2006 ) , 600 m M tyrphostin - 46 ( Biswas et al . , 2004 ) , 0 . 4 m M staurosporine ( Biswas et al . , 2004 ) or 1 m M wortmannin ( Biswas et al . , 2000 ; Hu et al . , 2006 ) . Immunoﬂuorescence labelling and confocal microscopy Immunoﬂuorescence labelling of infected host cells was per - formed as described elsewhere ( Brandt et al . , 2005 ) . Specimens were ﬁxed in 3 . 8 % ( v / v ) paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 20 min followed by permeabilization in PBS - 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 for 15 min . All antibodies were diluted in PBS - 1 % bovine serum albumin , and all incubations with antibodies were carried out for 1 h . Filamentous actin in the host cell was labelled with rhodamine - conjugated phalloidin ( Molecular Probes ) . Expression of GTPase constructs was detected using an a - c - Myc antibody as described above , followed byAlexa 350 - labelled a - mouse IgG ( Molecular Probes ) . IF - labelled samples were analysed with a Leica TCS SP2 confocal laser scanning microscope ( Leica Microsystems , Bensheim , Germany ) . Confocal image data obtained with a 100 ¥ / 1 . 4 N . A . oil immersion objective and CLSM software ( Leica Microsystems ) were processed digitally using Velocity software ( version 3 . 6 ) which allows optimizing images in brightness and contrast and pseudo - colouring : GFP ( green ) , rhodamine ( red ) and Alexa - 350 ( blue ) and the determination whether the bacteria are inside or outside of infected cells . GTPase activation assays Rac1 and Cdc42 activation in infected cells was determined with the Rac1 and Cdc42 activation assay kit ( Cytoskeleton ) . Brieﬂy , INT - 407 cells were grown to 80 % conﬂuency and serum - starved overnight . Subsequently , cells were incubated in PBS ( pH 7 . 4 ) as a control or infected with C . jejuni ( moi of 200 ) in a time - course . Uninfected and infected INT - 407 cells were washed with PBS , re - suspended in the assay buffer of the kit and detached from dishes with a cell scraper . For a positive and negative control , a portion of the uninfected cell lysate was mixed with GTP g - S and GDP for 15 min respectively . Cell lysates ( treated with bacteria , GTP g - S , GDP or untreated ) were mixed with the PAK - RBD slurry ( 1 h , 4°C ) . Finally , the beads were collected by centrifugation and Role of Rho GTPases and CadF in Campylobacter jejuni invasion 2441 © 2007 The Authors Journal compilation © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd , Cellular Microbiology , 9 , 2431 – 2444 washed three times with assay buffer . Activated Rac and Cdc42 were then visualized by immunoblotting as described below . To conﬁrm equal amounts of protein for each sample , aliquots of the lysates from different time points were also analysed by immuno - blotting . The GTPase activities were quantiﬁed as band intensities representing the amount of active Rac1 - GTP and Cdc42 - GTP using the Lumi - Imager F1 software program ( Roche ) . SDS - PAGE and immunoblotting Proteins from transfected and / or infected INT - 407 cells were separated on 10 – 15 % polyacrylamide gels and blotted onto polyvinylidene diﬂuoride ( PVDF ) membranes ( Immobilon - P ; Milli - pore ) . Staining with primary antibodies against Rac ( Upstate ) , Cdc42 ( Santa Cruz ) , CadF ( Konkel et al . , 1997 ) or GAPDH ( Santa Cruz ) wasperformedaccordingtothemanufacturer’sinstructions . As a secondary antibody , horseradish peroxidase - conjugated a - mouse , a - rabbit or a - goat IgG was used ( DAKO ) . Immunoreac - tivebandswerevisualizedbyECLplusWesternBlottingDetection System ( Amersham Biosciences ) . FESEM INT - 407 monolayers grown on coverslips were infected with C . jejuni for either 4 h or 6 h , then ﬁxed with a ﬁxation solution containing 5 % formaldehyde and 2 % glutaraldehyde in cacody - late buffer ( 0 . 1 M cacodylate , 0 . 01 M CaCl 2 , 0 . 01 M MgCl 2 , 0 . 09 M sucrose ; pH 6 . 9 ) and subsequently washed several times with cacodylate buffer . Samples were dehydrated with a graded series of acetone ( 10 % , 30 % , 50 % , 70 % , 90 % and 100 % ) on ice for 15 min for each step . Samples in the 100 % acetone step were allowed to reach room temperature before another change of 100 % acetone . Samples were then subjected to critical - point drying with liquid CO 2 ( CPD030 , Balzers , Liechtenstein ) . Dried samples were covered with a 10 nm thick gold ﬁlm by sputter coating ( SCD040 , Balzers Union , Liechtenstein ) before examina - tion in a ﬁeld emission scanning electron microscope ( Zeiss DSM - 982 - Gemini ) using the Everhart Thornley SE detector and the inlens detector in a 50 : 50 ratio at an acceleration voltage of 5 kV . Statistical analysis All data were evaluated using the Student’s t - test with SigmaStat statistical software ( version 2 . 0 ) . P - values (cid:2) 0 . 05 were consid - ered as statistically signiﬁcant .
