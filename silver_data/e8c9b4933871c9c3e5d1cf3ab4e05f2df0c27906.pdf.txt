Most of them are closely linked with unique clinical manifestations and could go undetected until there is a complication . Management of these diseases requires long - term informal care , and this has resulted in a complex network of relation - ships between patients , complementary care providers , informal and formal caregivers . Unfortunately , there are not many studies investigating these relationships from a decolonized perspective with the intention of co - designing interventions that are unique to their lived experiences . This workshop aims to bring together researchers working on digital health and care projects in Africa to discuss the implications of existing collaborative care structures and cultures for technology , as well as near future Afrocentric approaches to collaborative care . We aim to highlight existing chal - lenges in technology enabled collaborative care , differentiate them from established challenges in the Global North and identify design opportunities . This workshop will contribute to the growing atten - tion shown to the African continent in CSCW and HCI research more broadly .

Some of the NCDs with high mortality rates include diabetes , cancer , and cardio - vascular diseases , and a report by the World Health Organisation revealed that they were responsible for at least 37 % of mortalities in Sub - Saharan Africa ( SSA ) [ 25 ] . In the same report , NCDs were declared to be responsible for 50 % - 88 % of deaths in seven African countries - these diseases claim approximately 400 , 000 lives per year . Due to notable shift in disease burden from communicable diseases to NCDs [ 11 , 15 , 23 ] , a silent epidemic of chronic diseases may be a fast - approaching reality . NCDs are known to affect diverse indigenous populations and high - income earners resident in these countries are not left out [ 8 ] . Type 2 Diabetes ( T2D ) for example , is 537 CSCW ’23 Companion , October 14 – 18 , 2023 , Minneapolis , MN , USA Oritsetimeyin et . al a recurring challenge in SSA with approximately 24 million positive diagnoses and millions still undiagnosed [ 12 ] . Non - communicable diseases are usually chronic in nature and require long - term collaborative care [ 6 ] . As a result , healthcare systems have to adequately prepare for an increasing disease bur - den and the provision of adequate care . Additionally , most of these NCDs involve sporadic acute episodes and this also affects overall disease management [ 4 ] . Currently , there are therapeutic alterna - tives for the management of most NCDs and non - pharmacological options for lifestyle modifications , yet a significant percentage of the African population have not attained a standard quality of life [ 13 ] . This could be as a result of factors such as changing be - havioural practices , economic disparities [ 10 ] , poor healthcare in - frastructures [ 3 ] , flawed collaborative care systems [ 24 ] , and the ne - glect of contextualization and socio - cultural practices in the design of Digital Health Interventions [ 5 , 9 ] . The importance of collabora - tive care in chronic disease management cannot be over emphasized , and for this reason Scientific , it is timely to bring together CSCW and HCI researchers working in this context to discuss current and future collaborative technology trends . Advances in Artificial Intelligence , Human - Computer Interac - tion , Telemedicine , genomics etc [ 18 ] , have resulted in a variety of digital health and care DH interventions which are permeating the African continent [ 1 ] . The confidence and acceptance rate of these solutions differ per African country . For example , in SSA countries , technology adoption has been slow compared to High - Income coun - tries ( HICs ) and reasons for this could include poor literacy levels , economic disparities , limited influence from the government and lack of trust for DH interventions [ 14 , 16 ] . Unfortunately , there is insufficient evidence on how to support the context specific technol - ogy needs through Afrocentric Collaborative Care design , although there is growing interest in CSCW and HCI [ 2 , 17 , 19 , 20 ] . There are significant differences between African countries and other parts of the world , and significant contrast between African countries themselves . It is important to understand the context of a target population so as to 1 ) Encourage Equality , Diversity and Inclusion in design practices [ 7 , 21 ] , 2 ) Facilitate the development of interventions that have considered previously ignored nuances and , 3 ) Increase confidence and adoption rates of DH Interventions . Thus , it can be argued that worldviews should not be imposed on a population as a ’one size fits all’ approach to design is visibly flawed . 2 WORKSHOP THEMES AND OBJECTIVES Digital Health Researchers and enthusiasts , clinicians overseeing chronic disease care , pro - Afrocentric interest groups and individu - als with an interest in providing context specific care are invited to engage in this workshop . The objectives of this workshop are : 1 ) To explore the current scope of collaborative care in African countries2 ) To discuss the impact of context and socio - cultural structures on collaborative care and the design of digital interventions 3 ) To participate in envisioning Afrocentric Collaborative Care FuturesThese shall be discussed under the following themes : 1 ) Care pathways : This theme will consider formal and informal care pathways , with an aim to elaborate on the complex network of collaborative care in most African countries . 2 ) Absence and lack of access to Digital Health interventions : We hope to expand on the different barriers impacting the design and adoption of Digital Interventions . 3 WORKSHOP STRUCTURE 3 . 1 Format and Call for Participation We propose that theworkshop encourages online participation . This will permit individuals unable to travel to the conference in different zones to participate , particularly from the AfriCHI community . We propose a six hour workshop , this will grant us enough time to have in - depth discussions and conduct activities without being under pressure to summarize . We will cooperate with the organisers of the CSCW conference so as to encourage participants to attend and engage in other workshops . For example , adhering to deadlines and being responsible for tools / technical equipment that may facilitate the workshop . 3 . 1 . 1 Workshop Submissions . Firstly , an announcement will be made via the organiser’s networks and website providing relevant information about the workshop and links for other researchers to make submissions . A call for submissions will be advertised on the website and CSCW , HCI , and African specific health email lists to encourage participation in the hybrid workshop . Interested partici - pants from academia will be encouraged to submit two - to - four - page submissions in ACM CHI format that report on work - in - progress , position papers , or reflections on past research on collaborative care in Africa . These papers will be assessed on their appropriateness to the workshop call , their alignment with the workshop themes and their potential to provoke discussion at the workshops . They will be juried by the organisers of the workshop . Other participants such as clinicians or Digital Health enthusiasts will be encouraged to submit reports , posters , or short 90 second videos with their tai - lored biographies . We are aiming for a maximum number of thirty ( 30 ) participants . 3 . 2 Logistics As it is important to allow for hybrid participation to encourage involvement beyond those who can travel to CSCW , we propose that the workshop will be hosted in - person and using an accessible video - conference platform that will encourage and support engage - ment in the form of chats , breakout rooms and live captions e . g . , Zoom . Before the workshop , we shall provide relevant information such as : the agenda of the workshop , workshop facilitators , contact emails , video conference links . Additionally , position papers and other submitted materials will be made available on the workshop’s website or open access publication platforms . We will also be ask - ing if participants would like to share their email addresses and join a mailing list to allow for a community to be formed around Afrocentric Collaborative Care . 3 . 3 Pre - Workshop Activities We will be setting up a website to advertise the papers accepted to the workshop as well as communication channels . This will include Slack so that the participants can contact each other prior to the 538 Afrocentric Collaborative Care : Supporting Context Specific Digital Health and Care CSCW ’23 Companion , October 14 – 18 , 2023 , Minneapolis , MN , USA workshop , discuss online during the hybrid workshop , and build community and connections long after the end of the workshop . 3 . 4 Tentative Timeline • 10th JULY 2023 : Call for participation advertised widely • 25th AUGUST 2023 : Submission deadline for authors • 8th SEPTEMBER 2023 : Notification of acceptance • 18th SEPTEMBER 2023 : Camera - ready papers / other submis - sions due • 14th OCTOBER 2023 : Workshop 3 . 5 Tentative Workshop Schedule • 09 : 00 – 09 : 05 : Introduction by organiser • 09 : 05 – 09 : 20 : Opening Keynote • 09 : 20 – 10 : 20 : Lightning talks / Presentations A • 10 : 20 – 11 : 00 : Online break • 11 : 00 – 12 : 15 : Round table discussion of themes / Break out rooms • 12 : 15 – 01 : 00 : Panel discussion • 01 : 00 – 02 : 00 : Lightning talks / Presentations B • 02 : 00 – 02 : 30 : Question and Answer session • 02 : 30 – 03 : 00 : Closing Keynote , wrapping up and reflections 3 . 6 Description of Activities ( 1 ) Opening Keynote : The Keynote speaker will introduce the workshop , highlight objectives and provide a general structure of the workshop to attendees . ( 2 ) Lightning talks / Presentations : The participants will be divided into two groups based on the workshop’s themes . Each group will have a maximum of 10 participants . They will be given approximately 6 minutes each to present their work . ( 3 ) Introduction of themes / Break out rooms : We propose that there will be two break out rooms to align with each theme of this workshop . These themes and related objectives will be displayed to attendees , and they will have the liberty of selecting either of them based on their interests . Attendees will discuss and share ideas in each breakout room . There - after , representatives from each group will present to the whole group . ( 4 ) Panel discussion : Panelists will have discussions centered around the themes ( 5 ) Question and Answer session : In this segment of the work - shop , panelists will be addressing concerns from the panel discussion and answering questions . 4 EXPECTED OUTCOMES We expect to : • Encourage conversations between research communities and individuals from different backgrounds . • Invite contributors to submit their work as extended papers to make up a special issue publication on Afrocentric Collab - orative Care in a journal such as CSCW Journal or IJHCS . 5 CALL FOR PARTICIPATION This workshop explores the implications of existing collaborative care structures and cultures for technology , as well as near future Afrocentric approaches to collaborative care . This workshop will be held online in conjunction with ACM CSCW 2023 in Minneapolis , MN , USA . The importance of collaborative care in Africa cannot be over em - phasized , and for this reason , it is important to bring together CSCW and HCI researchers working in this context to discuss current and future collaborative technology trends . Advances in Artificial In - telligence , Human - Computer Interaction , Telemedicine , genomics etc . , have resulted in a variety of digital health and care interven - tions which are permeating the African continent . The African context has different implications for the success of any technol - ogy interventions , and there are significant differences between countries and regions that are often overlooked in western - focused approaches to innovation and research in CSCW and HCI . This workshop will take a decolonized perspective with the intention of exploring past , current and future research on participatory and context specific interventions that are unique to lived experiences of health and care on the African continent . This workshop will bring together researchers working on digi - tal health and care projects in Africa to discuss . Together we will highlight existing challenges in technology enabled collaborative care , differentiate them from established challenges in the Global North and identify design opportunities . This workshop will con - tribute to the growing attention shown to the African continent in CSCW and HCI research more broadly . As it is important to allow for hybrid participation to encourage involvement beyond those who can travel to CSCW , the workshop will be hosted online using an accessible video - conference platform that will encourage and support engagement in the form of chats , breakout rooms and live captions . Interested participants from academia should make two - to - four - page submissions in ACM CHI format that report on work - in - progress , position papers , or reflections on past research on col - laborative care in Africa . These papers will be assessed on their appropriateness to the workshop call , their alignment with the workshop themes and their potential to provoke discussion at the workshop . They will be juried by the organisers of the workshop . Other participants such as clinicians or Digital Health enthusiasts will be encouraged to submit reports , posters , or short 90 second videos with their tailored biographies .
