Continuity of deformation across polyacrylamide layers . ( a ) Top panel : Experimental measurement of the x - deformation applied by a motile Physarum amoeba at the top xy - plane of the substratum , u ( x , y , z = h 0 ) , obtained by tracking red ﬂuorescent beads embedded in the top substratum layer . The scale bar is 50 µ m long . Center panel : Experimental measurement of the x - deformation at a second xy - plane underneath the surface , u ( x , y , z = h 1 ) , obtained by tracking green ﬂuorescent beads embedded in an intermediate substratum layer . Bottom panel : Experimental measurements of the deformation in a vertical xz - section of the substratum indicated by the dashed lines in the top and middle panels , u ( x , z ) . The deformations obtained by tracking both red and green beads in different substratum layers have been stacked to demonstrate the continuity of the measured deformations in the z direction . The scale bar is 5 µ m high . ( b ) Same as ( a ) but this time the y - deformation v exerted by the cell on the substratum is represented . ( c ) Same as ( a ) but this time the z - deformation w exerted by the cell on the substratum is represented . Traction force microscopy can be performed on a linearly elastic substratum when con - stant body forces and / or external contact stresses act upon the substratum The equation of elastostatic equilibrium ( 1 ) , which is solved to recover traction stresses from measurements of substratum deformation , is generally accepted to hold when both the body forces and external contact stresses acting on the substratum are negligible . Here , we demonstrate that this equation also holds in the presence of appreciable body forces and contact stresses , as long as these are constant in time and the substratum is linearly elastic . Relaxing the assumption of negligible body forces and external contact stresses can be used to broaden the application of traction force microscopy to a wide range of non - conventional experimental setups . Particularly , it covers the setup used in our study , where the substratum is subjected to the weight of an agar cap during the duration of our microscope recordings . We still assume that the inertia and viscosity of the substratum are negligible , leading to this equation of equilibrium for the substratum at an instant of time t with cell when the cell is present in the ﬁeld of view ∇ · [ τ elastic ( u with cell ) ] + ρ f + δ ( S ) τ contact = 0 , ( SI1 ) and to this other equation at a different instant of time t whitout cell when the cell is absent from the ﬁeld of view ∇ · [ τ elastic ( u without cell ) ] + ρ f + δ ( S ) τ contact = 0 . ( SI2 ) In these two equations , u with cell represents the deformation caused by both the body forces and the cell , whereas u without cell represents the deformation caused by the body forces and external contact stresses in the absence of the cell . The elastic stress tensor in the substratum is τ elastic . The time - independent body force is f and ρ is the substratum density . The external contact stress is τ contact and δ ( S ) is a Dirac delta that enforces the application of this stress only at surface S ( i . e . z = h in the case of the agar cap ) . We now subtract equations ( SI1 ) and ( SI2 ) to obtain ∇ · [ τ elastic ( u with cell ) − τ elastic ( u without cell ) ] = 0 , ( SI3 ) where the body force and the contact stress cancel out because they are constant in time . We now note that if the substratum is linearly elastic , equation ( SI3 ) is equivalent to ∇ · [ τ elastic ( u with cell − u without cell ) ] = 0 , ( SI3 ) where u = u with cell − u without cell is the deformation measured in our experiments by performing image correlation between z - stacks acquired at t = t with cell and t without cell . Furthermore , note that u is the deformation caused by the traction stresses generated by the cell .

Relative error in the recovered traction stresses as a function of the signal - to - noise ratio of the measured deformation S 2 N 0 and the lengthscale of the noise patterns δ / µ . The data were obtained for the synthetic deformation ﬁeld in eq . ( 6 ) of the main text using σ = 0 . 45 , h 0 − h 1 = 0 . 15 , h 0 = 2 . 5 µ and U 0 = W 0 . The error is deﬁned as Err ( S 2 N 0 , δ ) = | | (cid:126) τ 0 − (cid:126) τ ( S 2 N 0 , δ ) | | | | (cid:126) τ 0 | | , where (cid:126) τ 0 is the ground truth traction stress vector and (cid:126) τ ( S 2 N 0 , δ ) is the traction stress recovered when the deformation ﬁeld has additive noise of signal - noise - ratio S 2 N 0 and lengthscale δ .
