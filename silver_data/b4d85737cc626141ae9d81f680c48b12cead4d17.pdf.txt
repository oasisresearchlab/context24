Februar 2016 Berlin 2016 Abstract Bilayer membranes are an essential component of biological cells , functioning as robust but ﬂexible walls between cellular compartments that can remodel in response to stimuli . Interestingly , many of these remodeling processes can be mimicked in minimal model systems using lipid or polymer vesicles . The goal of this thesis will be to understand two of these processes from a theoretical perspective . First , we examine the spontaneous formation of nanotubes in giant vesicles as a consequence of bilayer asymmetry . In connection with experimental results , and using numerical energy minimization of a continuum membrane model , we show that the nanotubes appear via a nucleation and growth mechanism that reﬂects two competing kinetic pathways as the vesicles are osmotically deﬂated . The ﬁrst pathway nucleates new isolated buds , whereas the second pathway makes the isolated buds grow into necklace - like tubes . Furthermore , we show that the necklace - like tubes undergo a novel shape transformation into cylindrical tubes once they reach a certain critical tube length , for which we ﬁnd analytical expressions that are consistent with the experimental results . Second , we study the engulfment of adhesive nanoparticles by vesicles and biomembranes . We show that the engulfment behavior depends strongly on the asymmetry of the bilayer , as quantitatively described by the membrane spontaneous curvature . We derive analytical expressions for the instabilities of the free and the completely engulfed states of the particle , which depend on the particle size , adhesive strength , bending rigidity and spontaneous curvature . For model membranes with uniform composition , the two instabilities lead to two critical particle sizes that determine four distinct engulfment regimes . Our analytical expressions can be used to extract the membrane spontaneous curvature and the particle – membrane adhesive strength from experimental or simulation studies . In order to address the process of endocytosis in cells , we then consider adhesion - induced segregation of membrane components . The asymmetric protein coat formed during clathrin - dependent endocytosis is modeled as a bound membrane segment that has a large sponta - neous curvature compared to the unbound one . We derive explicit expressions for the engulf - ment rate and the uptake of nanoparticles by cells , which provide a quantitative ﬁt to experi - mental data for clathrin - dependent endocytosis of gold nanoparticles . Finally , we examine the engulfment of nanoparticles by membranes of complex shape , and show that nanoparticles can act as local probes of the membrane curvature . We ﬁnd that a single vesicle in contact with many nanoparticles can display up to ten distinct engulfment patterns , and describe in detail the morphological transitions between these patterns , which are directly accessible to experiment . Zusammenfassung Lipid - Doppelschichten ( ‘lipid bilayers’ ) sind ein essenzieller Bestandteil von biologischen Zellen , sie dienen als robuste , aber gleichzeitig ﬂexible Trennwände zwischen zellulären Kompartimenten , die unter dem Einﬂuss von äusseren Stimuli umgebaut werden . Interessanterweise können viele dieser Umbauprozesse in relativ einfachen Modellsystemen aus Lipid - oder Polymer - Membranen untersucht werden . In dieser Arbeit geht es um das theoretische Verständnis zweier dieser Umbauprozesse , nämlich der Bildung von Membran - Nanoröhrchen und des Membran - Einschlusses ( ‘engulfment’ ) von festen Nanoteilchen . Zuerst betrachten wir die spontane Bildung von Nanoröhrchen in Riesenvesikeln ( ‘giant vesi - cles’ ) als Folge einer relativ großen spontanen Krümmung , die die Asymmetrie zwischen den beiden Monoschichten ( ‘leaﬂets’ ) der Vesikelmembranen beschreibt . Ausgehend von experimentellen Resultaten , bei denen die Riesenvesikel osmotisch geschrumpft wurden , zeigen wir mittels Energie - minimierung , dass Nanoröhrchen durch einen Keimbildungs - und Wachstumsprozess entstehen , der auf zwei kompetitiven kinetischen Pfaden beruht . Der erste Pfad führt zur Bildung von einzelnen neuen Membran - Knospen ( ‘buds’ ) , die dann mittels des zweiten kinetischen Pfades zu Perlenketten verlängert werden . Wenn diese Perlenketten eine kritische Länge erreichen , wandeln sie sich in zylindrische Nanoröhrchen um . Für diese neuartige Form - Transformation wurde eine analytische Theorie entwickelt , die im Einklang mit den bisherigen experimentellen Beobachtungen steht und quantitative Vorhersagen für die kritische Röhrchenlänge liefert . Anschließend untersuchen wir den Einschluss von adhärenten Nanoteilchen durch Vesikel und biolo - gische Membranen . Wir zeigen , dass das Einschlussverhalten stark von der spontanen Krümmung der Membranen abhängt . Wir leiten analytische Ausdrücke für die Instabilitäten von freien und komplett eingeschlossenen Zuständen der Nanoteilchen ab und bestimmen deren Abhängigkeit von Partikelgröße , Adhäsionsstärke , Biegesteiﬁgkeit und spontaner Krümmung . Für Modellmembranen mit homogener Zusammensetzung erhalten wir zwei kritische Teilchengrößen , aus denen sich vier verschieden Parameterbereiche für das Einschlussverhalten ergeben . Die analytischen Ausdrücke können verwendet werden , um die spontane Krümmung und die Adhäsionsstärke aus Experimenten und / oder Simulationen abzuleiten . Um im Weiteren den Prozess der Endozytose in Zellen zu untersuchen , betrachten wir die durch Adhäsion induzierte Segregation von Membrankomponenten , die auf eine relativ große spontane Krümmung des am Teilchen gebundenen Membransegments führen kann . Wir leiten explizite Ausdrücke für die Einschlussrate und die zelluläre Aufnahme der Nanoteilchen ab . Wenn wir diese theoretischen Ergebnisse mit experimentellen Daten zur Clathrin - abhängigen Endozytose von Gold - Nanoteilchen vergleichen , so erhalten wir eine quantitative Beschreibung der beobachteten Größenabhängigkeit dieses Prozesses . Abschließend untersuchen wir Membranen und Vesikel von beliebiger Form , die mit vielen Nan - oteilchen wechselwirken . Wir zeigen , dass diese Teilchen als Sonde für die lokale Membrankrümmung verwendet werden können . Dabei stellt sich heraus , dass eine Vesikel , die sich in einer Dispersion von identischen Nanoteilchen beﬁndet , bis zu zehn verschiedene Einschlussmuster aufweisen kann . Wir sagen morphologische Übergänge zwischen diesen Mustern voraus , die auch experimentell zugänglich sein sollten .

As a consequence of their role as barriers between distinct compartments with distinct functions , all biological membranes are exposed to an asymmetric environment , a fact that is reﬂected in a compositional asymmetry between the two leaﬂets that form the membranes . 2 , 3 Thanks to their ﬂuidity , biological membranes are highly dynamic structures that can remodel in response to external and internal cues . Some of these remodeling processes occur on the micrometer scale corresponding to whole - cell deformations , as is the case in cell spreading or cytokinesis . 4 , 5 On the other hand , cell membranes can also remodel on the nanometer scale , as occurs in the formation of spherical and tubular membrane protrusions such as blebs or microvilli , which have typical sizes on the order of tens or hundreds of nanometers . 6 Among these remodeling processes , of particular practical importance are those involved in the entry of nanometer - sized particles into cells . Indeed , nanoparticles are increasingly used for targeted delivery of drugs to biological cells , 7 , 8 reaching diﬃcult targets such as tumors 9 , 10 or the blood - brain barrier . 11 , 12 Novel magnetic nanoparticles are being developed as contrast agents in Magnetic Resonance Imaging , 13 , 14 whereas gold nanoparticles are being used in X - Ray imaging and photothermal therapies . 15 , 16 Nanoparticles are also more and more common in industrial processes , which has lead to concerns about their cytotoxicity . The world production of nanoparticles is projected to increase 25 - fold in the period between 2008 and 2020 , 17 with nanoparticles being extensively used in cosmetics , food , paints , powders , and surface treatment . 18 Both in vitro and in vivo studies ﬁnd that nanoparticles can be cytotoxic in large doses , with toxicity levels depending on nanoparticle size , shape , and surface chemistry . 17 , 19 , 20 A further particularly important class of nanoparticles comprises viruses . Viral capsids typically range in size from 20 to 300 nm , and enter cells via the same pathways as artiﬁcial nanoparticles . 21 Insights on these pathways may help in preventing viral infection before replication . In order to enter a cell , a particle must ﬁrst cross the cellular membrane . This process is termed endocytosis , and starts with the adhesion and engulfment of the particle by the membrane , followed by membrane ﬁssion . 22 , 23 The particle then ends up inside the cytoplasm , fully enclosed by membrane . Several distinct endocytic pathways used by cells 1 1 Introduction to take up nanoparticles have been described , depending on the molecular machinery involved . 22 , 23 Of these , the most commonly observed is clathrin - mediated endocytosis , which is assisted by the formation of a strongly curved protein coat on the inner side of the membrane . 22 Interestingly , some of these remodeling processes can be mimicked in minimal model systems . First , the formation of nanometer - sized tube - like protrusions has been observed in experiments in which liposomes 24 – 28 or Giant Unilamellar Vesicles ( GUVs ) 29 – 31 are exposed to asymmetric concentrations of curvature - generating proteins . Second , engulfment of solid particles by liposomes , 32 , 33 GUVs 34 – 42 and polymer vesicles 43 has also been observed to occur spontaneously in experiments . An understanding of remodeling processes in these biomimetic systems can be very useful , as they allow insight into the fundamental membrane processes underlying their biological counterparts , without the added complexity intrinsic to living cells . In this work , we set out to understand , from a theoretical perspective , ( i ) the spontaneous formation of membrane nanotubes in model systems and ( ii ) the engulfment of particles by biological and biomimetic membranes . In both cases , we will emphasize the key role of membrane asymmetry in the remodeling process . 1 . 2 Biomembranes 1 . 2 . 1 Lipid bilayers Lipids are among the most important molecules in biology , constituting about 10 % of cells by dry weight ( data for E . coli ) . 44 Lipids are amphiphilic molecules , that is , they combine a hydrophilic ( water - loving ) head and a hydrophobic ( water - hating ) tail , see Figure 1 . 1 ( a ) . 45 Typically , the tail is composed of two hydrocarbon chains . At very low concentrations , they are soluble in water . However , as soon as the concentration reaches the so - called critical micelle concentration ( CMC ) , they self - assemble into structures in which only the hydrophilic heads are exposed to the water , thereby shielding the core of hydrophobic tails . 46 The two most common such structures are micelles and bilayers , see Figures 1 . 1 ( b ) and 1 . 1 ( c ) . Which structure forms will depend on the concentration and on the shape of the lipids : conical lipids with a single tail or a large head groups form micelles , whereas those with a more cylindrical shape tend to form bilayers . 46 Free lipid bilayers of ﬁnite size in water would have exposed hydrophobic edges , which would involve a large energy cost . For this reason , they typically close into round “bags” called vesicles , which will be described in more detail in Section 1 . 3 . Lipid bilayers are thin membranes composed of two monolayers of lipids , see Figure 1 . 1 ( c ) . These membranes have the striking property of being just a few nanometers in thickness , while being able to extend to much greater lengths , of the order of tens of micrometers , in the lateral direction . At room or physiological temperatures they are typically in a ﬂuid 2 1 . 2 Biomembranes Figure 1 . 1 : Schematic architecture of lipids and lipid structures .

They oﬀer resistance to stretching and bending but , being ﬂuid , they cannot support shear stresses because the lipid molecules can freely rearrange within each monolayer plane . 47 , 48 In contrast to this in - plane mobility , the movement of lipids from one monolayer to the other ( known as ﬂip - ﬂop ) is much more restricted , and happens only in the timescale of hours or days for most lipids . 49 One important exception to this rule is the biologically - relevant cholesterol , which is known to ﬂip - ﬂop much faster . 50 At lower temperatures , lipid bilayers are found in a solid state , also known as the gel phase . 45 In the gel phase , lipids show in - plane crystalline order , which leads to increased bending rigidity , shear resistance and decreased ﬂip - ﬂop rates . The transition from the gel to the ﬂuid phase occurs at a temperature called the melting temperature , which depends on the particular type of lipid that forms the bilayer . 45 However , it is also possible to form bilayers with a mixture of two or more lipids , leading to a much more complex phase behaviour . In this case , bilayers can display phase coexistence between the ﬂuid and gel phase at intermediate temperatures 51 and , in the presence of cholesterol , there can also be coexistence between two distinct ﬂuid phases . 52 – 54 These two phases are called liquid - ordered ( Lo ) and liquid - disordered ( Ld ) , referring to the order of the lipid chains . It is debated whether binary mixtures of a single phospholipid and cholesterol show ﬂuid - ﬂuid separation , 53 , 54 but macroscopic ﬂuid - ﬂuid phase separation is well - documented for ternary mixtures of cholesterol and two other lipids . 52 , 54 A very important characteristic of lipid bilayers is their selective permeability . Hydrophobic molecules can cross lipid membranes with ease , whereas membranes are highly impermeable to ions . In the case of uncharged polar molecules , their permeability depends on size : small molecules ( including water ) can cross the membrane , while large molecules such as sugars cannot . This fact is of great relevance to the structural stability of biological cells , which actively regulate the passage of ions through the membrane by using specialized proteins called ion channels . 55 In Figure 1 . 1 ( c ) , a symmetric bilayer in which both monolayers are identical is depicted . It is however very common , particularly in biological membranes , 2 , 3 to encounter asymmetric Jaime Agudo Canalejo 3 1 Introduction Figure 1 . 2 : Molecular mechanisms for the generation of bilayer asymmetry . ( a ) compositional lipid asymmetry between the two leaﬂets of the bilayer ; ( b ) asymmetric concentration of membrane - anchored molecules with a bulky headgroup such as glycolipids ; and ( c ) asymmetric adsorption of ions or small molecules . bilayers in which each monolayer has a diﬀerent lipid composition from the other , see Figure 1 . 2 ( a ) . Other mechanisms that generate bilayer asymmetry include asymmetric concentration of membrane - anchored molecules with a bulky head group , such as glycolipids , and asymmetric adsorption of ions or small molecules , see Figures 1 . 2 ( b ) and 1 . 2 ( c ) . 31 From a mechanistic perspective it is clear that , whereas symmetric bilayers will tend to be ﬂat , asymmetric bilayers will typically prefer to curve towards one of the two sides , acquiring a certain spontaneous curvature . In the case of molecules with a bulky headgroup or asymmetric adsorption , membranes will tend to bend away from the side with more bulky or adsorbed molecules . In the case of asymmetric composition of lipids , the preferred curvature will depend mostly on the shape of the lipids involved . 56 1 . 2 . 2 The plasma membrane Lipid bilayers are the main ingredient of biomembranes , which are the essential structural element of cells , acting as ‘walls’ or separation barriers between cells and their environment , or between diﬀerent organelles within the cell . Apart from lipids , biomembranes are mainly composed of proteins and a few carbohydrates , see Figure 1 . 3 . In this so - called ﬂuid - mosaic model of cell membranes , ﬁrst proposed by Singer and Nicolson in 1972 , 57 the cell membrane is viewed as a ﬂuid lipid bilayer in which proteins are embedded and can freely diﬀuse . As depicted in the ﬁgure , biomembranes are strongly asymmetric : the lipid composition is typically diﬀerent between leaﬂets , the proteins do not have a symmetric shape , and often the cellular cytoskeleton is coupled to the membrane on one of its sides only . 56 Biomembranes diﬀer in their composition depending on their particular function , with great diﬀerences across cell types and between organelles of the same cell , and more than 1000 diﬀerent lipid species being present in any eukaryotic cell . 1 Of all biomembranes , perhaps the most studied is the plasma membrane , which separates the interior from the exterior of a cell , protecting the cell from its surroundings . Plasma membranes of animal cells are composed of lipids and proteins in approximately equal weight , 59 and 4 1 . 2 Biomembranes Cytoskeleton Lipids Glycosylphosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) Cholesterol Carbohydrate Proteins Figure 1 . 3 : Fluid - mosaic model of the plasma membrane .

Jaime Agudo Canalejo 5 1 Introduction show a strong asymmetry in the lipid compositions of the outer and inner leaﬂets . 2 , 3 In fact , this asymmetry is actively regulated by the cell via proteins called ﬂipases and ﬂopases , which respectively bring selected lipids from the outer to the inner leaﬂet and vice versa . Conversely , this asymmetry can be destroyed by proteins called scramblases . 2 , 3 Other proteins with important functions present in the plasma membrane include ion transporters , as described in the previous section , and membrane receptors which relay signals between the outside and the inside of cells . Transmembrane proteins often have asymmetric , wedge - like shapes , further contributing to the asymmetry of the membrane . 56 In addition , the plasma membrane in eukaryotic cells is linked on the inner side to the cellular cortex , which is a dense network of actin ﬁlaments and myosin motors that actively regulates the cell shape , see Figure 1 . 3 . 58 For all these reasons , the plasma membrane of cells is a highly dynamic structure , and typically displays complex shapes , with outwards and inwards protrusions , folds and wrinkles that can act as membrane reservoirs , 6 , 60 see Figure 1 . 4 . Membrane reservoirs are particularly important in the case of phagocytic cells , specialized immune cells that have the function of engulﬁng large solid particles such as bacteria or apoptotic cells . When engulﬁng a large particle , an initially round phagocytic cell can increase its “apparent” plasma membrane area by up to 5 - fold , 61 which implies that up to 80 % of the total membrane area is stored in reservoirs . In addition to the area stored in folds and wrinkles , the plasma membrane is subject to constant recycling , with the full content of the plasma membrane being exchanged in the timescale of a few hours . 62 1 . 3 Elastic theory of membranes 1 . 3 . 1 General theory As mentioned in Section 1 . 2 . 1 , the lateral span of bilayers can be up to three or four orders of magnitude larger than their thickness . Such separation of length scales allows one to describe the membrane as an inﬁnitesimally thin two - dimensional surface embedded in three - dimensional space . 47 The local shape of the membrane at any given point is characterized by the two principal curvatures C 1 ≡ 1 / R 1 and C 2 ≡ 1 / R 2 , see Figure 1 . 5 , which are the maximal and minimal curvatures of the membrane along two perpendicular directions on its surface . 47 More importantly , from these two quantities one can deﬁne at each point the mean curvature M ≡ ( C 1 + C 2 ) / 2 ( 1 . 1 ) and the Gaussian curvature K ≡ C 1 C 2 ( 1 . 2 ) which are independent of the choice of coordinates . It is clear that the local bending energy density of a membrane at any given point should depend on the curvature of the membrane at that point . To a ﬁrst approximation , one can 6 1 . 3 Elastic theory of membranes R 2 R 1 Figure 1 . 5 : Principal radii of curvature R 1 and R 2 of a two - dimensional surface at a given point . The corresponding principal curvatures are deﬁned as C 1 ≡ 1 / R 1 and C 2 ≡ 1 / R 2 . Adapted from Ref 63 . thus write the bending energy as an expansion in the deviation of the membrane curvature from its optimal value , obtaining 47 , 64 E be = (cid:2) d A (cid:2) 2 κ ( M − m ) 2 + κ G K (cid:3) ( 1 . 3 ) to lowest order , where the constants κ and κ G have units of energy and are known as bending rigidity and Gaussian bending rigidity , respectively . These two bending rigidities are material parameters . The third material parameter is the spontaneous curvature m , which describes the preferred mean curvature of the membrane that results from the existence of bilayer asymmetry . The integral in eq ( 1 . 3 ) runs over the whole surface A of the membrane . The sign of the mean curvature M and the spontaneous curvature m must be deﬁned by convention : in the case of closed vesicles , we will say that curvatures are positive if the membrane bends away from the interior compartment , as in the case of a spherical vesicle , and negative if the membrane bends towards the interior compartment . A second contribution to the total elastic energy of the membrane comes from area stretching . 48 , 65 Indeed , the number of lipids being ﬁxed , the membrane will have a preferred , optimal resting area A 0 . Molecularly , this optimal area can be understood as A 0 ≡ A lip ( N + + N − ) / 2 , where A lip is the optimal area per lipid , and N + and N − are the number of lipids in each monolayer . Again , expanding the energy on the deviations from this optimal area , the stretching contribution to the total energy will be given by E st = k A 2 A 0 ( A − A 0 ) 2 ( 1 . 4 ) Jaime Agudo Canalejo 7 1 Introduction to lowest order , with k A being a material parameter known as the area compressibility of the membrane . The tension of the membrane as a response to area stretching or compression can be calculated as the derivative of this stretching energy with respect to the area , obtaining 48 Σ = k A A − A 0 A 0 ( 1 . 5 ) and is thus simply proportional to the dimensionless strain of the membrane . By taking into account the bilayer structure of the membrane in a more molecularly detailed theory , one can show that the area compressibility is related to the bending rigidity by k A ∼ κ / d 2 , where d is the bilayer thickness . 65 Lipid membranes can support little area expansion , rupturing if they are stretched more than a few percent of their optimal area . As discussed in Section 1 . 2 . 1 , in the absence of cholesterol the number of lipid molecules on each monolayer is constant in the timescale of hours , as lipid ﬂip - ﬂop from one monolayer to the other is very rare . This ﬁxes the optimal area of each monolayer independently so that the diﬀerence in optimal area between monolayers is given by ΔA 0 ≡ ( N + − N − ) A lip . 65 Deviations from this optimal area diﬀerence will incur an energy cost , which is given by the area diﬀerence elasticity ( ADE ) model , again to lowest order , 66 E ade = ¯ κπ 2 Ad 2 ( ΔA − ΔA 0 ) 2 ( 1 . 6 ) where ¯ κ is a material parameter called the non - local bending rigidity and d is the bilayer thickness . Taking into account that the typical curvatures of a vesicle are much smaller than the inverse thickness of the bilayer , one can write the area diﬀerence ΔA as a function of the membrane shape with ΔA = 2 d (cid:2) d AM + O ( d 2 ) ( 1 . 7 ) where again the integral runs over the whole surface A of the membrane . As previously noted , membranes typically form closed vesicles , which divide the aqueous solution into two compartments , an interior one and an exterior one . This fact is important because , as discussed before , lipid membranes are impermeable to ions and large uncharged polar molecules . We will call these molecules osmotically active , because they exert an osmotic pressure onto the membrane . Assuming an ideal solution of molecules , the diﬀerence between the pressures exerted by the molecules in the interior and exterior compartments is 67 ΔP ≡ P int − P ext = k B T ( n / V − ρ ext ) ( 1 . 8 ) where k B is the Boltzmann constant , T the temperature , n the number of osmotically active molecules inside the vesicle , V the volume enclosed by the vesicle , and ρ ext the number density of osmotically active molecules in the exterior compartment . We can deﬁne the optimal volume of the vesicle V 0 ≡ n / ρ ext , at which the osmotic pressure diﬀerence is 8 1 . 3 Elastic theory of membranes zero . Deviations from this optimal volume will cost an energy E vol = (cid:2) V V 0 dV (cid:2) ΔP ( V (cid:2) ) = k B T [ n ln ( V / V 0 ) − ρ ext ( V − V 0 ) ] ≈ k B Tρ ext 2 V 0 ( V − V 0 ) 2 ( 1 . 9 ) where the last expression holds for small deviations from the optimal volume | V / V 0 − 1 | (cid:5) 1 . In principle , the total energy of the system will be given by these four energies of bending ( 1 . 3 ) , stretching ( 1 . 4 ) , area diﬀerence elasticity ( 1 . 6 ) and volume work ( 1 . 9 ) , so that E tot = E be + E st + E ade + E vol ( 1 . 10 ) Specifying the full system would require eleven parameters : six material parameters deﬁning the membrane , namely the bending rigidity κ , the Gaussian bending rigidity κ G , the non - local bending rigidity ¯ κ , the area compressibility k A , the bilayer thickness d , and the spontaneous curvature m ; two control parameters , given by the number density of osmotically active molecules in the exterior compartment ρ ext and the temperature T ; and three geometric parameters that deﬁne an individual vesicle , namely its optimal area A 0 , optimal volume V 0 and optimal area diﬀerence between monolayers ΔA 0 . Exploring such a high - dimensional parameter space would seem like a daunting task . Luckily , as explained in the next subsection , many of these contributions can be simpliﬁed or ignored when considered detail . 1 . 3 . 2 Eﬀective constraints on vesicles A ﬁrst simpliﬁcation arises from the fact that there is a large separation between the energy scale associated with bending , which is of order κ , and that associated with stretching , which is of order k A A 0 . Indeed , the typical value of the bending rigidity for lipid membranes is κ ∼ 10 − 19 J , whereas the area compressibility is on the order of k A ∼ 0 . 2 J / m 2 . 68 The energy scale of stretching will be much larger than that of bending as long as √ A 0 (cid:7) (cid:4) κ / k A ∼ 0 . 7 nm . This is the case for all realistic vesicles , for which √ A 0 ranges from several tens of nanometers to tens of micrometers . As a consequence , stretching will be negligible and the area of vesicles will not deviate signiﬁcantly from the optimal area , so that we can set the constraint A = A 0 A similar consideration can be done with the volume work . The energy associated with deviations from the optimal volume will be of order k B Tρ ext V 0 , compared to the energy associated with bending κ . Thus , we can consider the enclosed volume to be essentially ﬁxed as long as the number density of osmotically active molecules in the exterior compartment is large enough ρ ext (cid:7) κ / k B TV 0 . Using the typical value of κ , and at room temperature , one ﬁnds that for small vesicles of size 100 nm the threshold concentration of osmotically active molecules is in the μ M range , and goes down to pM range for larger vesicles of size 10 μ m . In most experiments , as well as in physiological conditions , the osmolarity of the aqueous solutions is typically above the mM range , and therefore the enclosed volume Jaime Agudo Canalejo 9 1 Introduction of vesicles is constrained to V = V 0 . However , it is sometimes the case that experiments with vesicles are done in pure water . In such cases , we have ρ ext (cid:8) 0 and the energetic contribution of volume work can be dropped altogether . One further simpliﬁcation arises from the fact that many experiments are done with membranes made from lipid mixtures including cholesterol . As mentioned before , cholesterol can easily ﬂip - ﬂop from one monolayer to the other , therefore uncoupling the monolayers and relaxing the constraint on the area diﬀerence between them . This implies that we can formally set ¯ κ = 0 in ( 1 . 6 ) , that is , neglect the contribution from area diﬀerence elasticity . Finally , we note that the second term in ( 1 . 3 ) , the one associated with the Gaussian curvature , does not depend on the speciﬁc shape of the vesicle . The Gauss - Bonnet theorem 69 tells us that the integral of the gaussian curvature over a closed surface is a topological invariant , with (cid:3) d AK = 4 π ( 1 − g ) , where g is the genus of the vesicle . For a vesicle of spherical topology g = 0 , for one of toroidal topology g = 1 , etc . Therefore , as long as we do not consider changes in the vesicle topology , the Gaussian term of the bending energy only adds a constant term to the total energy and we can formally set κ G = 0 in ( 1 . 3 ) . With all these considerations , the total energy that we must consider when describing free vesicles in typical experimental conditions becomes E = (cid:2) d A 2 κ ( M − m ) 2 ( 1 . 11 ) with only two material parameters , namely the bending rigidity κ and the membrane spontaneous curvature m , and two geometrical constraints on the total area A and volume V that must be explicitly enforced . In practice , one can choose an energy scale , naturally given by κ , and a length scale , such as the vesicle size R ve ≡ (cid:4) A / 4 π . The equilibrium shapes of free vesicles then depend only on two dimensionless parameters : the reduced spontaneous curvature mR ve and the reduced volume v ≡ 3 V / 4 πR 3 ve . 64 1 . 3 . 3 Shape transformations of vesicles 1 . 3 . 3 . 1 Free vesicles A problem of great interest amounts to ﬁnding the equilibrium shape of a vesicle for given values of the parameters , that is , ﬁnding the shape S that minimizes the energy ( 1 . 11 ) for given mR ve and v . In principle , this is achievable by functional minimization of the energy ( 1 . 11 ) . In order to incorporate the area and volume constraints , one minimizes the functional 70 F [ S ] = E [ S ] + ΣA [ S ] − ΔPV [ S ] ( 1 . 12 ) where Σ and ΔP are Lagrange multipliers . The same symbols Σ and ΔP as for the tension and pressure diﬀerence are used , both for historical reasons and because they can be 10 1 . 3 Elastic theory of membranes shown to be identiﬁable . 71 Functional minimization of F leads 70 to the so called shape equation ΔP = 2 ΣM − 2 κ (cid:5) ∇ 2 M − ( M − m ) (cid:2) 2 ( M − m ) M − 4 M 2 + 2 K (cid:3)(cid:6) ( 1 . 13 ) where ∇ 2 is the Laplace - Beltrami operator . The shape equation ( 1 . 13 ) is a non - linear fourth order partial diﬀerential equation , and is therefore extremely hard to solve analytically . In the limit of zero bending rigidity κ = 0 , it reduces to the Laplace equation for ﬂuid - ﬂuid interfaces as given by ΔP = 2 ΣM . A set of solutions that can be obtained by directly inspecting ( 1 . 13 ) is the set of surfaces with constant mean curvature ∇ 2 M ≡ 0 that satisfy ΔP = 2 ( Σ + 2 κm 2 ) M − 4 κmM 2 . Of these , perhaps the most relevant are spheres , for which M = 1 / R where R is the radius of the sphere . The sphere is in fact the lowest energy shape for vesicles in the absence of osmotically active molecules ΔP = 0 , that is , in the absence of a volume constraint , for small values of the spontaneous curvature . In the presence of a volume constraint , however , spheres can only be the solution for reduced volume v = 1 , and lower values of the reduced volume necessarily require solutions with non - uniform mean curvature in order to satisfy 0 < v < 1 . 64 If one wants to ﬁnd the solutions of ( 1 . 13 ) for given reduced spontaneous curvature mR ve and reduced volume v , one needs to do so numerically . This is still a complicated task , but it becomes particularly simple when considering axisymmetric shapes and , crucially , axisymmetric shapes can be shown to be those of lowest energy for small values of the spontaneous curvature mR ve = O ( 1 ) . 64 The two - dimensional phase diagram of lowest energy ( stable ) shapes in this region of small spontaneous curvatures is shown in Figure 1 . 6 ( a ) . There are four diﬀerent branches of solutions : prolates , oblate - discocytes , stomatocytes and pear - shaped vesicles . The transitions D between prolates and oblates , D sto between oblates and stomatocytes , and D pear between prolates and pears are discontinuous ; whereas the transition C pear between pears and prolates is continuous . At the lines L pear and L sto , limit shapes involving inﬁnitesimally small necks are obtained . The lines SI sto and SI ob delineate regions with self - intersecting , unphysical shapes . The simplest case that we can consider is that of vesicles without bilayer asymmetry , that is , with no spontaneous curvature m = 0 , as a function of the reduced volume v . This is indicated by the dotted line in Figure 1 . 6 ( a ) . As one deﬂates the vesicle from a sphere v = 1 , one ﬁnds stable prolates in the range 1 > v > 0 . 65 , oblate - discocytes in the range 0 . 65 > v > 0 . 59 , and stomatocytes for 0 . 59 > v > 0 . Example shapes along the deﬂation trajectory are shown in Figure 1 . 6 ( b ) . As v approaches zero , a limit shape is obtained with two concentric spheres of equal size connected to each other by an inﬁnitesimal neck . The shape evolution is radically diﬀerent in the presence of spontaneous curvature . In the upper and lower regions of the phase diagram in Figure 1 . 6 ( a ) we ﬁnd budding , that is , the formation of a smaller daughter vesicle ( bud ) connected to the larger mother vesicle as Jaime Agudo Canalejo 11 1 Introduction Reduced volume v S p o n t aneou s c u r v a t u r e 0 1 2 - 1 - 2 m [ 1 / R v e ] ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) ( d ) Figure 1 . 6 : The shapes of free vesicles .

( b – c ) Lowest energy shapes as a function of reduced volume v for ( b ) symmetric membranes with m = 0 , and ( c ) asymmetric membranes with mR ve = + 1 . 5 which display budding . ( d ) Experimental observation of a budding transition . Adapted from ( a – c ) Ref 64 and ( d ) Ref 72 . 12 1 . 3 Elastic theory of membranes the vesicle is deﬂated . For positive spontaneous curvatures , the budding occurs towards the outside , as shown in Figure 1 . 6 ( c ) for mR ve = + 1 . 5 , whereas for negative spontaneous curvatures the budding occurs towards the inside . The budded state has lowest energy to the left of the lines D pear and D sto for positive and negative spontaneous curvatures , respectively . Between the lines D pear and L pear , or D sto and L sto , the bud is connected to the mother vesicle by a small but ﬁnite neck . To the left of L pear and L sto , however , the neck becomes inﬁnitesimally small . The stability limit of such inﬁnitesimally small necks is given by the ideal neck condition M mv + M bud = 2 m ( 1 . 14 ) where M mv and M bud are the mean curvature of the mother vesicle and of the bud at the position of the ideal neck , respectively . More generally , it can be shown 71 , 73 that out - buds are stable if M mv + M bud < 2 m , whereas in - buds are stable if M mv + M bud > 2 m . The ideal neck condition ( 1 . 14 ) was ﬁrst found empirically in numerical calculations , 64 and later proven analytically . 73 Such budding transitions have been observed in experiment , 72 as seen in the micrographs in Figure 1 . 6 ( d ) . 1 . 3 . 3 . 2 Vesicles with intramembrane domains As mentioned in the Introduction , membranes made from ternary lipid mixtures including cholesterol can phase separate into two distinct ﬂuid macroscopic domains . Suppose a ﬂuid domain of phase β is embedded in a ﬂuid matrix of phase α , see Figure 1 . 7 ( a ) . In general , the phases α and β will have diﬀerent bending rigidities κ ( α ) and κ ( β ) , as well as diﬀerent spontaneous curvatures m ( α ) and m ( β ) . The domain will be bounded by a domain wall or edge with a ﬁnite line tension λ , which will contribute a line energy E (cid:4) = λ(cid:10) αβ , where (cid:10) αβ is the length of the domain edge . Because of the ﬂuid nature of the membrane , it is be possible for the domain to reduce this line energy by bending out of plane , that is , by budding . 74 By balancing the bending contribution with the edge contribution , it is straightforward to see that domains will tend to bud once they become larger than a characteristic size given by κ ( β ) / λ . 74 Such domain - induced budding has also been observed in experiments , as shown in Figure 1 . 7 ( b ) . Using numerical energy minimization , the lowest energy shapes of a phase separated vesicle with a ﬂuid domain can be obtained as a function of the relevant parameters . 76 , 77 Once again , one ﬁnds wide regions of the phase diagrams which display fully - budded states , in which the bud of phase β is connected to the mother vesicle of phase α by an inﬁnitesimally small neck . The stability limit of such states is given by 76 , 77 κ ( α ) M mv + κ ( β ) M bud = κ ( α ) m ( α ) + κ ( β ) m ( β ) ± λ / 2 ( 1 . 15 ) where again M mv and M bud are the mean curvature of the mother vesicle and of the bud at the position of the neck , respectively . The plus sign in front of the line tension applies to Jaime Agudo Canalejo 13 1 Introduction ( a ) ( b ) Figure 1 . 7 : Domain - induced budding . ( a ) Schematic depiction of an initially ﬂat ﬂuid domain ( 1 ) that reduces its edge energy by bending out of plane ( 2 ) and forming a bud ( 3 ) . ( b ) Experimental observation of domain - induced budding , with Lo and Ld phases labeled in blue and red respectively . Scale bars are 5 μ m . Adapted from ( a ) Ref 74 and ( b ) Ref 75 . out - buds , whereas the minus sign applies to in - buds . This equation can be understood as a generalization of the ideal neck condition ( 1 . 14 ) to the case of phase separated membranes . Indeed , by setting κ ( α ) = κ ( β ) , m ( α ) = m ( β ) and λ = 0 in ( 1 . 15 ) we directly recover ( 1 . 14 ) . 1 . 3 . 3 . 3 Vesicles adhering to planar substrates Working with free vesicles is experimentally challenging , due to their intrinsic Brownian rotation and translation , that make following a single vesicle with the usual confocal microscope setup diﬃcult . For this reason , experimentalists typically work with vesicles that are bound to a planar substrate either ( i ) by attractive forces or ( ii ) through gravitation , by ﬁlling the vesicles with a denser solution than the surrounding one . Furthermore , adhesion of membranes to substrates or between each other is a topic of biological relevance , as cells are often cultured in adhesive substrates and membrane - membrane adhesion is always the ﬁrst step in membrane fusion . 78 For large vesicles , there is a separation of length scales between the typical range of adhesive forces , such as van der Waals or electrostatic interactions which act on the range of a few nanometers , and the size of the vesicles , which is on the order of micrometers . For this reason , it is possible to use a contact potential , in which we replace the microscopic interaction potential by an eﬀective adhesion energy W < 0 per unit area of membrane that is bound to the substrate . Thus , if A bo is the membrane area bound to the substrate , the vesicle gains an adhesion energy 79 E ad = − | W | A bo ( 1 . 16 ) The presence of the contact potential ( 1 . 16 ) does not aﬀect the shape equation ( 1 . 13 ) , but enters into the boundary conditions for the solution . The bound segment and the unbound segment of the vesicle membrane are separated by a contact line . Along this contact line , the principal curvature C ∗ 1 of the membrane parallel to the contact line must 14 1 . 4 Membrane nanotubes Figure 1 . 8 : Shapes of an adhering vesicle . The vesicle is initially spherical with radius R ve and has no volume constraint . The adhesive strengths used are | W | R 2 ve / κ = 2 . 0 , 2 . 9 , 4 . 1 , 6 . 4 and 10 . 2 . Adapted from Ref 79 . be C ∗ 1 = 0 because the substrate is planar . 79 The second principal curvature perpendicular to the contact line follows from mechanical equilibrium along this line , with minimization of the free energy leading to the value C ∗ 2 = (cid:4) 2 | W | / κ . 79 The contact mean curvature is therefore M co = ( C ∗ 1 + C ∗ 2 ) / 2 = (cid:4) | W | / 2 κ ( 1 . 17 ) In general , one ﬁnds that for low adhesion , the vesicles do not bind to the substrate , whereas they do bind for suﬃciently large values of the adhesion . The binding transition may be continuous , as is the case for spherical vesicles with no volume constraint , oblates and stomatocytes ; or discontinuous in the case of discocytes and prolate vesicles . As the adhesive strength is increased beyond the binding transition , the bound area increases progressively and the shape of the vesicle approaches a spherical cap . Example shapes for the case of a vesicle with no volume constraint for increasing values of the adhesive strength are shown in Figure 1 . 8 . In all cases , the stability limit of the free vesicle state is given by 65 M co = M fv ( 1 . 18 ) where M fv is the mean curvature of the free vesicle at the point of contact with the substrate before adhesion . Equation ( 1 . 18 ) can be rewritten as | W | = 2 κM 2 fv , and in particular | W | = 2 κ / R 2 ve in the special case of an initially spherical vesicle . 1 . 4 Membrane nanotubes In Section 1 . 3 . 3 . 1 , we described the shapes of free vesicles in the case of small spontaneous curvatures , of the order of the vesicle size m = O ( 1 / R ve ) . In practice , however , asymmetric Jaime Agudo Canalejo 15 1 Introduction g ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) 1 2 3 Figure 1 . 9 : Membrane nanotubes in the presence of curvature - inducing proteins .

Membrane nanotubes are indicated by arrows ( scale bar 15 μ m ) . Adapted from ( a ) Ref 56 , ( b ) Ref 25 and ( c ) Ref 29 . protein adsorption to the membrane can induce very high spontaneous curvatures , of up to | m | = 1 / ( 20 nm ) in the case of specialized BAR - domain proteins , see Figure 1 . 9 ( a ) . 24 , 56 For a large vesicle of size R ve = 20 μ m , this would imply reduced spontaneous curvatures of the order of | m | R ve ∼ 1000 , far outside the boundaries of the phase diagram of free vesicle shapes in Figure 1 . 6 ( a ) . Indeed , the vesicle morphologies observed in the presence of such large spontaneous curvatures are very diﬀerent from the ones described in the previous section . In experiments , proteins known to be curvature - inducing in cells , such as N - BAR proteins amphiphysin 24 , 25 and endophilin , 26 F - BAR protein syndapin , 27 as well as endocytosis - related proteins such as epsin , 28 have been adsorbed onto liposomes . The adsorption of the curvature - inducing proteins leads to complex shapes consisting of long and thin membrane tubules that spontaneously arise from the liposomes , see Figure 1 . 9 ( b ) . Spontaneous tubulation has also been observed in model systems consisting of Giant Unil - amellar Vesicles that enclose aqueous two - phase solutions of PEG and dextran polymers , 29 , 30 see Figure 1 . 9 ( c ) . These systems are very interesting from a biophysical perspective because they can mimic the nanometer - sized membrane area reservoirs present in micrometer - sized living cells , compare Figure 1 . 4 . The nanotubes form spontaneously upon deﬂation of the vesicle , and can store as much as 20 % of the excess area of the vesicle . However , a systematic theory of the formation and shapes of these membrane tubes has been lacking . 16 1 . 5 Particle – membrane interactions Indeed , it was argued 29 that the tubes were stabilized by the large negative spontaneous curvatures induced by the asymmetric adsorption or anchoring of the polymers , but what deﬁnes the shapes of these tubes was unclear . In principle , the bending energy ( 1 . 11 ) of a vesicle with a strongly negative spontaneous curvature m (cid:5) − 1 / R ve could be minimized by storing its excess membrane area into either ( i ) inwards - pointing cylindrical tubes with radius 1 / 2 | m | ; or ( ii ) inwards - pointing spherical buds with radius 1 / | m | . In both cases , the bending energy would be minimized because the mean curvature of the inwards protrusions would match the spontaneous curvature M = m . In addition , it is conceivable that single buds may be isolated from each other , or that they may be strung together into longer necklace - like tubes . The mechanisms that set the shape , number and length of these tubes have not been described so far . Understanding the formation of such nanotubes will be one of the aims of this thesis , see Chapter 2 . 1 . 5 Particle – membrane interactions 1 . 5 . 1 Adsorption , incorporation , translocation and engulfment As explained in the Motivation of this thesis , understanding the interaction between nanoparticles and membranes is of key importance to a number of scientiﬁc , medical and in - dustrial ﬁelds . ‘Nanoparticle’ , however , is an umbrella term that encompasses an astonishing variety of particles , made from diﬀerent materials and with widely diﬀering characteristics , such as fullerenes , 80 quantum dots , 81 and silver , 82 gold 83 or silica 84 nanoparticles . In the context of particle – membrane interactions , we may identify three nanoparticle properties of particular relevance : 85 • Size : nanoparticles can range from below 1 nm , in the case of spherical fullerenes , 80 up to a few hundreds of nanometers , in the case of large metallic 83 , 86 or silica nanopar - ticles . 84 Naturally , nanoparticles that are smaller than the membrane thickness d (cid:8) 5 nm will interact with the membrane in very diﬀerent ways than those that are of comparable size , or much larger than the membrane . • Shape : nanoparticles are most commonly spherical ; however , they can also show elongated shapes with one dimension larger than the other two , as in the case of carbon nanotubes 87 or gold nanorods ; 88 as well as ﬂat shapes with two dimensions larger than the third one , as in the case of graphene nanosheets . In this case it will be important whether one , two or all of its dimensions are larger or smaller than the membrane thickness d . • Surface chemistry : hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity , as well as surface charge , strongly inﬂuence the nanoparticle – membrane interactions . 89 In addition , nanoparti - cles may be functionalized by coating them with lipids , polymers or speciﬁc protein ligands that can bind to receptors on the membrane surface . 89 Jaime Agudo Canalejo 17 1 Introduction Depending on these properties , nanoparticles may either ( i ) adsorb onto the membrane , ( ii ) incorporate inside it , ( iii ) translocate through it or ( iv ) get engulfed by the mem - brane . Particle adsorption onto membranes was already described in Section 1 . 2 . 1 , see Figure 1 . 2 ( c ) . Particles that adsorb onto membranes are typically hydrophilic , so that they do not tend to penetrate inside the membrane , and small , with sizes comparable to the head group of the lipids . 90 , 91 As mentioned , asymmetric adsorption of nanoparticles between the two sides of the bilayer induces spontaneous curvature , with the membrane preferring to bend away from the side with the highest coverage of adsorbates . This was ﬁrst predicted theoretically 92 and later conﬁrmed in molecular dynamics simulations . 90 . Hydrophilic particles that are larger , of size comparable to the membrane thickness d (cid:8) 5 nm , and that exhibit an attractive interaction with the lipid headgroups may instead incorporate into the membrane , as found in molecular dynamics simulations , see Figure 1 . 10 ( a ) . 91 , 93 In order to maximize the contact with the hydrophilic head groups , the membrane changes its topology and completely surrounds the particle . Incorporation into the membrane also occurs in the case of hydrophobic particles of size comparable to or smaller than the membrane thickness d . Smaller hydrophobic nanoparticles , such as spherical fullerenes , may incorporate into the hydrophobic core of the membrane without altering its structure , see Figure 1 . 10 ( b ) . 91 , 94 – 96 Such nanoparticle incorporation into the bilayer has been widely observed in experiments . 97 – 102 Larger hydrophobic particles , on the other hand , will not ﬁt inside the hydrophobic core , and may therefore induce a pore on the membrane that they will span , see Figure 1 . 10 ( c ) . 103 . It is also conceivable that a nanoparticle may directly translocate from one side to the other of the membrane , as shown in Figure 1 . 10 ( d ) . In order to achieve this , a pore must open in the membrane through which the particle can cross to the other side . Very small or elongated nanoparticles , with dimensions around a nanometer , such as uncharged polar molecules , metal nanoclusters , dendrimers and carbon nanotubes have been shown to translocate through membranes with little to no disruption . 106 – 110 Larger particles of a few nanometers , on the other hand , can translocate through the membrane only by disrupting its integrity . This occurs in the case of charged particles ( such as cationic quantum dots or gold nanoparticles ) which induce transient poration of the cell membrane when entering cells , leading to increased cytotoxicity . 109 , 111 , 112 In all the cases described , the particles were of size comparable or smaller than the membrane thickness d . As soon as particles become larger ( in all dimensions ) than a few times the membrane thickness , incorporation or translocation become unfavorable and , if the interaction between the hydrophilic surface of the membrane and the particle is attractive , the membrane will instead bend around the particle and engulf it , as in Figure 1 . 10 ( e ) . 92 , 113 The engulfment process ends with the particle fully covered by membrane but still connected to the mother membrane by a small neck , as in the rightmost picture of Figure 1 . 10 ( e ) . This neck might then break via membrane ﬁssion , with the 18 1 . 5 Particle – membrane interactions ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) ( d ) ( e ) time Figure 1 . 10 : Diﬀerent modes of interaction between particles and mem - branes .

In ( b ) , the particle is hydrophobic of radius R pa < d and incorporates into the membrane core . In ( c ) , the hydrophobic particle of radius R pa (cid:2) d ﬁrst induces and then spans a pore in the membrane . In ( d ) , an elongated particle of size comparable to d translocates across the membrane by opening a pore . In ( e ) , a hydrophilic particle of radius R pa (cid:7) d is gradually engulfed by the membrane , remaining connected by a small neck in the end .

Jaime Agudo Canalejo 19 1 Introduction particle then having been eﬀectively transported from one side of the membrane to the other . In the rest of this section , we will review previous experimental and theoretical work on particle engulfment . 1 . 5 . 2 Engulfment by model membranes The ﬁrst experiments that mixed vesicles with solid particles were performed nearly 20 years ago , by Dietrich et al . 34 In those experiments , Giant Unilamellar Vesicles of a few tens of microns in size were made from DMPC or SOPC membranes in the ﬂuid state . Single spherical Latex particles with radii ranging from 1 μ m to 10 μ m were then brought in contact with a single vesicle using an optical trap . Immediately after the particle made contact with the vesicle membrane , the particle was observed to jump out of the optical trap and into the membrane , that would engulf it . Both complete engulfment and partial engulfment were observed . Occasionally , the particles were observed to induce rupture of the vesicle membrane . Indeed , the vesicles used were initially spherical and semi - tense , and the osmotic conditions were such that the enclosed volume of the vesicle was constrained . As a consequence , in order to engulf the particles the vesicle membrane needs to stretch , leading to rupture if the membrane stretches more than a few percent . Similar experiments with spherical GUVs and single particles manipulated by optical tweezers have been performed later , again ﬁnding spontaneous engulfment of the particles by the vesicles . 35 , 36 Other experiments with GUVs and Latex particles have been performed using more deﬂated , non - spherical vesicles , with enough excess area so that the vesicle can engulf the particles without stretching . 37 The vesicles would thus display prolate and oblate - discocyte morphologies , as those described in Section 1 . 3 . 3 . 1 . The Latex particles were observed to get partially engulfed at the areas of lowest curvature of the vesicles , such as at the poles of discocyte vesicles or the sides of prolate vesicles , see Figure 1 . 11 ( a ) . In other experiments , GUVs have been mixed with solutions containing much smaller nanoparticles , in the size range of tens of nanometers . Various types of nanoparticles have been used , such as quantum dots , 38 silica , 39 , 40 polystyrene 41 or core – shell magnetic nanopar - ticles . 42 Depending on the surface properties , in particular surface charge of the particles , as well as the charge of the lipid membranes , nanoparticles were found to localize at the vesicle surface , sometimes leading to deformation and rupture of the membranes . However , the studies used optical microscopy , making it impossible to discern whether the nanoparticles were partially or completely engulfed by the membranes . Lastly , experiments have been performed in which lipid 32 , 33 or polymer 43 vesicles of small size , in the range of a few hundred nanometers , were mixed with solutions of silica nanoparticles , with sizes of a few tens of nanometers . In all cases , complete engulfment followed by neck ﬁssion and full internalization of the particles by the vesicles was clearly observed using cryo - electron microscopy , see e . g . Figure 1 . 11 ( b ) . 20 1 . 5 Particle – membrane interactions ( a ) ( b ) Figure 1 . 11 : Engulfment of particles by vesicles . ( a ) Partial engulfment of a single Latex particle at the pole of a discocyte GUV ( left ) and of multiple particles at the side of a prolate GUV . ( b ) Complete engulfment ( followed by neck ﬁssion ) of silica nanoparticles by a small liposome . Adapted from ( a ) Ref 37 and ( b ) Ref 33 . From a theoretical perspective , the engulfment of particles by membranes can be understood as a competition between adhesion and bending energies , as in the case of vesicle adhesion to planar substrates , see Section 1 . 3 . 3 . 3 . For particles much larger than the range of the adhesion potential , we can once again consider a contact potential with a given adhesion energy per unit area W < 0 . The adhesion energy will then be given by E ad = − | W | A bo , where A bo is the area of membrane that is bound to the particle . The gain in adhesion energy will be opposed by the energetic cost of bending the membrane around the particle . Such an energy balance was ﬁrst considered by Lipowsky and Döbereiner , 92 for the case of a large vesicle ( with zero spontaneous curvature ) engulﬁng a small spherical particle . The vesicle is assumed to have enough excess area so that its membrane does not need to stretch in order to accommodate the particle . If the particle has radius R pa , the energy gain from adhesion will amount to − | W | 4 πR 2 pa for a completely engulfed particle , and will therefore increase with particle size . On the other hand , the cost of bending the membrane around the particle amounts to 2 κ ( 1 / R 2 pa ) 4 πR 2 pa = 8 πκ , and is therefore independent of particle size . Ignoring the change in bending energy of the unbound part of the membrane due to engulfment , which should be negligible if the particle is much smaller than the vesicle , we ﬁnd that complete engulfment is energetically favorable if | W | 4 πR 2 pa > 8 πκ or , equivalently , R pa > (cid:7) 2 κ | W | ( 1 . 19 ) Therefore , engulfment becomes energetically favorable only for large enough particles . If the size of the particle is not negligible compared to the vesicle size , one must consider the energy contribution of the change in shape of the unbound segment of the vesicle after engulfment , ΔE un ≡ E un − E fr , where E un is the energy of the unbound segment after complete engulfment and E fr is the energy of the free vesicle ( before engulfment ) . The condition for energetically favorable engulfment then becomes | W | 4 πR 2 pa > 8 πκ + ΔE un . Jaime Agudo Canalejo 21 1 Introduction For vesicles without spontaneous curvature and constrained volume , one ﬁnds always ΔE un < 0 , and the threshold radius for engulfment therefore decreases . 114 In addition , if the free vesicle is close to a shape transition , such as in the phase boundaries between discocytes / oblates or oblates / prolates as shown in Figure 1 . 6 ( b ) , the engulfment of the particle may induce the shape transition of the vesicle . 115 , 116 A limitation of the approach leading to equation ( 1 . 19 ) is that it simply compares the energy of the free and completely engulfed states , but does not inform us about the stability of each state , that is , about the energy landscape of the engulfment process . Indeed , the transition from the free to the completely engulfed state may in principle occur discontinuously , meaning that there is an energy barrier between the two states , or continuously , via partially engulfed states . In order to achieve this , one would need to numerically calculate the energy of the unbound part of the membrane along the engulfment coordinate , that is , for increasing values of the bound area 0 ≤ A bo ≤ 4 πR 2 pa . This was carried out by Deserno 117 in the particular case of a planar membrane with no spontaneous curvature that is connected to a membrane area reservoir with ﬁxed tension . ∗ The condition ( 1 . 19 ) for favorable engulfment was found to be exact in the absence of membrane tension , with the transition being discontinuous , whereas in the presence of tension a continuous transition between free and partially engulfed states as well as a discontinuous transition between partial engulfment and complete engulfment were found . However , a systematic calculation of the energy landscapes of engulfment in the more realistic case of closed vesicles with ﬁxed membrane area ( and ﬁxed enclosed volume ) has not been attempted in the literature . More recent theoretical eﬀorts have focused on understanding the engulfment of non - spherical particles , such as ellipsoidal , rod - like or cube - like particles . 118 – 123 These particles have the common feature of having non - uniform curvatures , with weakly curved sides coexisting with strongly curved tips or edges . As a consequence , one ﬁnds discontinuous orientational changes of the particle during the engulfment process , with engulfment starting from the weakly curved side , but completing at the strongly curved tip . 118 , 120 , 121 Further eﬀorts have been dedicated to the engulfment of soft particles , such as small vesicles 124 , 125 , thin elastic shells 126 or liquid droplets . 127 In all cases , the softness of the particle enhances partially engulfed states in which the particle and the membrane spread onto each other . Lastly , some eﬀorts have been devoted to understanding the interactions of membranes with multiple spherical particles . If the range of the adhesive potential is non - negligible when compared to the particle size , membrane - mediated interactions can lead to cooperative engulfment of several nanoparticles into membrane tubes . 128 – 130 With a few exceptions , 115 , 116 , 118 , 128 , 129 all of these theoretical and simulation studies have dealt with particle engulfment by planar membranes rather than vesicles , and those who did consider vesicles did not explore the parameter space of vesicle sizes and shapes in ∗ In this case , the tension is neither treated as a mechanical force , as in eq ( 1 . 5 ) , nor as a Lagrange multiplier to keep the area constraint , as in eq ( 1 . 12 ) , but rather as a chemical potential for the membrane area reservoir . 22 1 . 5 Particle – membrane interactions any detail . In particular , the only two theoretical studies describing engulfment of single spherical particles by vesicles 115 , 116 have focused only on engulfment occurring at the poles of axisymmetric vesicles , due to the limitations of the numerical methods used therein . In addition , all of these studies have ignored the ( relevant ) possibility of bilayer asymmetry , focusing only on membranes with zero spontaneous curvature . Overcoming these limitations will be one of the main goals of this thesis , see Chapters 3 and 4 . 1 . 5 . 3 Engulfment by cells : endocytosis Many experiments have been performed in order to understand the endocytic pathways that bring solid nanoparticles into cells . As mentioned in the Introduction , the interaction of nanoparticles and cells is of key importance to the ﬁelds of drug delivery , optical imaging , nanotoxicity and virology . Several distinct endocytic pathways used by nanoparticles and viruses to enter cells have been described , 21 – 23 depending on the molecular machinery involved in the engulfment process : clathrin - mediated , which involves the formation of protein coats including clathrin triskelions , AP - 2 adaptor proteins and membrane receptors ; caveolin - mediated , involving membrane rafts enriched in caveolin , cholesterol and glycol - ipids ; macropinocytosis , dependent on actin polymerization ; phagocytosis as performed by specialized white blood cells ; as well as several less - studied pathways such as Arf6 - or ﬂotillin - mediated pathways . Given the variety of pathways , cell types and nanoparticles involved , it is perhaps too ambitious to try to do a comprehensive review of the existing work on endocytosis . The interested reader can ﬁnd comprehensive reviews on engulfment of nanoparticles 23 and viruses 21 elsewhere . It is however worthy to focus our attention on a particular ﬁnding with a more physical ﬂavor , namely the study of the dependence of endocytosis on particle size . In several studies , the uptake of gold nanoparticles 86 , 131 , 132 and artiﬁcial viral particles 133 , 134 by cells has been quantiﬁed as a function of the particle size . Intriguingly , the results indicate that there is an optimal particle size for which uptake is maximal : the optimal particle radius is found to be around 25 nm , with cell uptake decreasing both for larger and smaller particles . This non - monotonic dependence cell uptake with particle size is somewhat puzzling , in light of the theoretical results for engulfment by model membranes discussed in the previous subsection . Indeed , the energetic competition between bending and adhesion there described implied that the larger the particle , the more favorable is engulfment , see eq ( 1 . 19 ) . Naively , one would therefore expect cell uptake to increase monotonically with particle size , instead of showing a maximum at a given size . Attempts to solve this conundrum have so far been based on considering that ( i ) the particle – membrane adhesion is speciﬁc , that is , mediated by ligands on the particle surface that bind to receptors on the membrane , and ( ii ) the number of receptors on the membrane is limited . 135 – 141 In this type of model , particles have to be large enough to overcome the Jaime Agudo Canalejo 23 1 Introduction bending - related threshold given by eq ( 1 . 19 ) , but cannot be too large because they will then use up all the available membrane receptors , leading to incomplete engulfment . The competition between these two mechanisms leads to an optimum particle size for maximal cell uptake . However , the assumptions of these models conﬂict with several experimental observations . First , not only speciﬁc but also non - speciﬁc attractive interactions as mediated by surface charge are known to play important roles in endocytosis . 142 – 144 . Second , it is known that membrane receptors are continuously recycled between the plasma membrane and internal organelles , with constitutive recycling times ranging from a few minutes to half an hour . 145 Finally , the number of receptors bound per nanoparticle is typically just a few . 146 For these reasons , ascribing the decrease in cell uptake for larger particles to depletion of receptors on the membrane does not seem satisfactory . In this thesis , we will explain the size dependence of cell uptake observed in experiments as a consequence of the membrane asymmetry induced by protein coats , without the need of receptor shortage . This is developed in Chapter 3 . 1 . 6 Numerical minimization of bending energy 1 . 6 . 1 Axisymmetric shape equations In order to study the formation of membrane nanotubes and the engulfment of nanoparticles by vesicles , it is necessary to ﬁnd the shapes of membranes that minimize the bending energy ( 1 . 11 ) , subject to the necessary constraints . In the general case of a membrane or vesicle with arbitrary shape , functional minimization of the bending energy leads to the general shape equation ( 1 . 13 ) which , as mentioned previously , is extremely hard to solve . However , the shape equation simpliﬁes greatly when the search of minimum energy shapes is restricted to axisymmetric ones . Luckily , axisymmetry is present when we consider the shape of nanotubes , as well as the engulfment of particles at the poles of vesicles , see Figure 1 . 12 . Using the parametrization by the arc length s displayed in Figure 1 . 12 , the shape functional ( 1 . 12 ) that includes the bending energy as well as the area and volume constraints by Lagrange multipliers can be written as 64 F = (cid:2) s ∗ 0 d s L ( ψ , ˙ ψ , x , ˙ x , γ ) ( 1 . 20 ) where constant terms that do not aﬀect the minimization have been left out , and the ‘Lagrangian’ function is given by L ≡ πκx (cid:8) ˙ ψ + sin ψ x − 2 m (cid:9) 2 + 2 πΣx + πΔPx 2 sin ψ + γ ( ˙ x − cos ψ ) ( 1 . 21 ) 24 1 . 6 Numerical minimization of bending energy Figure 1 . 12 : Axisymmetric geometry and arc length parametrization . ( a ) A membrane nanotube that protrudes towards the outside of a spherical vesicle ( represented by the dotted segment ) , to which it connects by an inﬁnitesimally small neck . ( b ) A vesicle in contact with a spherical particle ( grey ) that originates from the exterior compartment . The unbound part of the vesicle membrane ( black ) , meets the bound part ( green ) smoothly at a certain wrapping angle φ . The bound part of the membrane has area A bo . where γ = γ ( s ) is a Lagrange multiplier function that serves to impose the geometrical constraint ˙ x = cos ψ . We now put the ﬁrst variation δF in ( 1 . 20 ) equal to zero and obtain the Euler - Lagrange equations of ( 1 . 21 ) , which have the form 64 ˙ ψ = u ˙ u = − u x cos ψ + cos ψ sin ψ x 2 + γ sin ψ 2 πκx + ΔPx cos ψ 2 κ ˙ γ = πκ (cid:10) ( u − 2 m ) 2 − sin 2 ψ x 2 (cid:11) + 2 πΣ + 2 πΔPx sin ψ ˙ x = cos ψ ( 1 . 22 ) where the dot denotes a derivative with respect to the arc length s . These are the axisymmetric shape equations , which form a system of nonlinear ordinary diﬀerential equations that can be solved numerically . These equations are subject to the initial condi - tions ψ ( 0 ) = 0 , u ( 0 ) = u 0 , γ ( 0 ) = 0 , x ( 0 ) = 0 . ( 1 . 23 ) with the initial value u 0 being unknown , which will be used to satisfy the boundary conditions at the end point s ∗ in a numerical shooting method . We can augment the system of equations in ( 1 . 22 ) with the equations for the area and Jaime Agudo Canalejo 25 1 Introduction volume as given by ˙ A = 2 πx ˙ V = πx 2 sin ψ ( 1 . 24 ) with initial conditions V ( 0 ) = 0 , A ( 0 ) = 0 . ( 1 . 25 ) The shape equations ( 1 . 22 ) and ( 1 . 24 ) , as well as the initial conditions ( 1 . 23 ) and ( 1 . 25 ) are identical when considering nanotube formation or particle engulfment . On the other hand , the boundary conditions at the end point s ∗ are diﬀerent in each case , as detailed in the following . 1 . 6 . 2 Application to nanotube formation In principle , nanotubes may be connected to the large mother vesicle by an open neck of ﬁnite size , or by an inﬁnitesimally small ‘ideal’ neck as shown in Figure 1 . 12 ( a ) . In the latter case , the curvature of the nanotube at the position of the neck must satisfy the inequality associated with the ideal neck condition ( 1 . 14 ) , in order for the neck to be stable . Carrying out the calculations , we ﬁnd ( a posteriori ) that the stability condition for an ideal neck is always satisﬁed . For this reason , we focus in the following on nanotubes that are connected by an ideal neck to a spherical mother vesicle of radius R mv . At ﬁrst sight , the problem has ﬁve unknown parameters , namely ΔP , Σ , u 0 , s ∗ and R mv . These should be used to enforce the boundary conditions at the end point s ∗ . In order to ensure a smooth matching of the nanotube shape at the north pole , and to satisfy the constraints on the total area A and enclosed volume V , the boundary conditions must be ψ ( s ∗ ) = ± π x ( s ∗ ) = 0 A ( s ∗ ) = A − 4 πR 2 mv V ( s ∗ ) = V − ( 4 π / 3 ) R 3 mv ( 1 . 26 ) where the plus and minus signs apply to nanotubes that point towards the exterior and the interior of the vesicle , respectively . We would therefore seem to have an underdetermined system with ﬁve unknowns and four equations . However , as explained in Section 1 . 3 . 3 . 1 , the mother vesicle can have a stable spherical shape of radius R mv only if it satisﬁes the Laplace - like equation ΔP = 2 ( Σ + 2 κm 2 ) R mv − 4 κm R 2 mv ( 1 . 27 ) which determines ΔP as a function of Σ and R mv . We thus have a well - posed boundary problem with four boundary conditions and four unknowns , that can be solved using a non - linear shooting procedure . The numerical 26 1 . 6 Numerical minimization of bending energy integration of eqs ( 1 . 22 ) and ( 1 . 24 ) , with initial conditions in eqs ( 1 . 23 ) and ( 1 . 25 ) , is performed using a Runge - Kutta method , while the search for the values of Σ , R mv , u 0 and s ∗ that satisfy the boundary conditions in ( 1 . 26 ) is carried out using Newton’s method . Choosing the vesicle size R ve ≡ (cid:4) A / 4 π as a length scale and the bending rigidity κ as an energy scale , the shapes of nanotubes can be determined as a function of just two dimensionless parameters : the reduced volume v ≡ 3 V / 4 πR 3 ve and the reduced spontaneous curvature mR ve . 1 . 6 . 3 Application to particle engulfment In the case of particle engulfment , we want to ﬁnd the minimum energy shape of the unbound segment of the membrane that matches smoothly with the segment bound to the particle at a wrapping angle φ , see Figure 1 . 12 ( b ) . The wrapping angle φ acts as a reaction coordinate for the engulfment process , from no engulfment at φ = 0 to complete engulfment at φ = π . The bound segment follows the contour of the particle , and thus assumes the shape of a spherical cap . This segment has the area A bo = 2 πR 2 pa ( 1 − cos φ ) ( 1 . 28 ) If we cut the spherical particle along the contact line , we obtain two spherical caps . The spherical cap adjacent to the bound membrane segment has the vol - ume V bo = 4 π 3 R 3 pa ( 2 + cos φ ) sin 4 φ 2 ( 1 . 29 ) Furthermore , the combined bending and adhesion energy of the bound membrane segment is given by E bo = (cid:2) 4 πκ ( 1 ± mR pa ) 2 − 2 π | W | R 2 pa (cid:3) ( 1 − cos φ ) ( 1 . 30 ) where the plus and minus signs apply to engulfment of particles that originate from the exterior and interior of the vesicle , respectively . There are in this case four unknown parameters , ΔP , Σ , u 0 and s ∗ , that are used to satisfy the four boundary conditions that enforce the area and volume constraints as well as the smooth matching , ψ ( s ∗ ) = π ± φ x ( s ∗ ) = R pa sin φ A ( s ∗ ) = A − A bo V ( s ∗ ) = V ± V bo ( 1 . 31 ) where again the plus and minus signs apply to engulfment of particles that originate from the exterior and interior of the vesicle , respectively . As before , all that remains is to numerically integrate eqs ( 1 . 22 ) and ( 1 . 24 ) , with the initial conditions in eqs ( 1 . 23 ) and ( 1 . 25 ) , while searching for the values of Σ , ΔP , u 0 and s ∗ that satisfy the boundary conditions in ( 1 . 31 ) . Jaime Agudo Canalejo 27 1 Introduction A given shape will be determined by four dimensionless parameters : the reduced vol - ume v , the reduced spontaneous curvature mR ve , the reduced particle radius R pa / R ve and the wrapping angle φ . By repeating this procedure for diﬀerent values of φ in the range 0 ≤ φ ≤ π , while keeping the other parameters ﬁxed , we can obtain the bending energy of the unbound segment E un ( φ ) along the reaction coordinate of the engulfment process . Taking the bending energy E un ( φ ) of the unbound segment together with the bending and adhesion energies of the bound segment as given by ( 1 . 30 ) , we obtain an energy landscape for engulfment E ( φ ) ≡ E un ( φ ) + E bo ( φ ) . The energy landscapes for engulfment will thus depend on four dimensionless parameters : the reduced volume v , the reduced spontaneous curvature mR ve , the reduced particle radius R pa / R ve , and the reduced adhesive strength | W | R 2 pa / κ . 1 . 7 References for the Introduction [ 1 ] G . van Meer , D .

My contributions as a co - author were to • Elucidate the formation of multiple nanotubes in terms of two competing pathways upon deﬂation : a pathway of slow lipid ﬂow through membrane necks that leads to the nucleation of new buds via an oblate - stomatocyte bifurcation ; and a pathway of fast lipid ﬂow through the necks that leads to the growth of pre - existing buds . See ‘Nucleation and Growth of Necklace - like Tubes’ in the main text . • Study , using numerical energy minimization as described in Section 1 . 6 of this thesis , the growth of single buds into necklace - like nanotubes , obtaining an energy landscape of tube formation as a function of the reduced volume of the vesicle . See ‘Nucleation and Growth of Necklace - like Tubes’ and Figure 5 in the Main Text . • Study the pathway of transformation of necklace - like tubes into cylindrical tubes via intermediate unduloids , showing that the mean curvature increases monotonically for given tube area and length , or conversely , that tube length increases monotonically for given mean curvature and tube area . See ‘Necklace – Cylinder Coexistence and Critical Tube Length’ and Figure 7 in the Main Text , as well as Figure S5 in the Supporting Information . • Calculate the critical tube length at which necklace - like tubes transform into cylin - drical tubes for VM - C morphologies , by considering the energetics of nanotubes adhering to a liquid - liquid interface . See ‘Necklace – Cylinder Coexistence and Critical Tube Length’ in the Main Text , as well as Section S2 and Figure S4 in the Supporting Information As a consequence of this work , we have expanded the previously - known theoretical phase diagram of the shapes of free vesicles , see Figure 1 . 6 in Section 1 . 3 . 3 . 1 of this thesis , to the region of very large spontaneous curvatures . We show that , in a deﬂation trajectory , 39 2 Patterns of Flexible Nanotubes Formed by Liquid - Ordered and Liquid - Disordered Membranes spherical buds form ﬁrst , later growing into necklace - like tubes that ﬁnally transform into cylindrical tubes via a novel transition when they reach a certain critical length . The increased theoretical understanding of the nanotube shapes allows us to deduce the spontaneous curvature of the membrane by image analysis of either ( i ) the tube radius or ( ii ) the total length and area of the tubes . We also obtain a better understanding of the formation and morphology of area reservoirs in model systems such as lipid or polymer vesicles , that can mimic those present in biological cells . 40 Patterns of Flexible Nanotubes Formed by Liquid - Ordered and Liquid - Disordered Membranes Yonggang Liu , † , ‡ Jaime Agudo - Canalejo , † Andrea Grafmu ̈ ller , † Rumiana Dimova , † and Reinhard Lipowsky * , † † Theory & Biosystems , Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces , 14424 Potsdam , Germany ‡ State Key Laboratory of Polymer Physics and Chemistry , Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry , Chinese Academy of Sciences , 130022 Changchun , China * S Supporting Information ABSTRACT : Biological membranes form both intra - and intercellular nanotubes that are used for molecular sorting within single cells and for long - distance connections between di ﬀ erent cells . Such nanotubes can also develop from synthetic lipid bilayers in their ﬂ uid state . Each nanotube has a large area - to - volume ratio and stably encloses a water channel that is thereby shielded from its surroundings . The tubes are rather ﬂ exible and can easily change both their length and their conformation . Here , we study nanotubes formed by liquid - ordered ( Lo ) and liquid - disordered ( Ld ) membranes with three lipid components exposed to aqueous mixtures of two polymers , polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) and dextran . Both types of membranes form striking patterns of nanotubes when we reduce the volume of giant vesicles by osmotic de ﬂ ation , thereby exposing the two bilayer lea ﬂ ets of the membranes to polymer solutions of di ﬀ erent composition . With decreasing volume , three di ﬀ erent patterns are observed corresponding to three distinct vesicle morphologies that re ﬂ ect the interplay of spontaneous curvature and aqueous phase separation . We show that tube nucleation and growth is governed by two kinetic pathways and that the tubes undergo a novel shape transformation from necklace - like to cylindrical tubes at a certain critical tube length . We deduce the spontaneous curvature generated by the membrane - polymer interactions from the observed vesicle morphologies using three di ﬀ erent and independent methods of image analysis . The spontaneous curvature of the Ld membranes is found to be 4 . 7 times larger than that of the Lo membranes . We also show that these curvatures are generated by weak PEG adsorption onto the membranes , with a binding a ﬃ nity of about 1 . 6 k B T per chain . In this way , our study provides a direct connection between nanoscopic membrane shapes and molecular interactions . Our approach is rather general and can be applied to many other systems of interest such as polymersomes or membrane - bound proteins and peptides .

We investigate and compare two di ﬀ erent lipid compositions that form a liquid - ordered ( Lo ) and a liquid - disordered ( Ld ) phase . The vesicles enclose aqueous polymer mixtures of dextran and polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) , an aqueous two - phase system that has been frequently used in biochemical analysis and biotechnology 13 to separate and purify biomole - cules , cell organelles , and cell membranes . The lipid membranes form striking patterns of nanotubes within the giant vesicles when we de ﬂ ate these vesicles osmotically , thereby exposing the two bilayer lea ﬂ ets to polymer solutions of di ﬀ erent composition . Three types of nanotube patterns can be distinguished corresponding to three di ﬀ erent vesicle morphol - ogies as shown schematically in Figure 1 . The theoretical analysis of these observations reveals that the tubes are nucleated from small buds which subsequently grow into necklace - like tubes . The necklaces are further extended until they transform into cylindrical tubes when their length exceeds a certain critical value . The critical length can be reduced by the adhesion of the nanotubes to interfaces . These morphological features are universal and apply to the de ﬂ ation - induced formation of membrane nanotubes in general . The magnitude of the bilayer asymmetry , arising from the exposure of the two lea ﬂ ets to di ﬀ erent polymer concentrations , is quantitatively described by the spontaneous curvature of the membranes . We introduce three di ﬀ erent and independent methods of image analysis to deduce this curvature from the observed vesicle morphologies . All three methods give very consistent results . The spontaneous curvature m of the Ld and Lo membranes is found to be m Ld ≃ − 1 / ( 125 nm ) and m Lo ≃ − 1 / ( 600 nm ) over a certain range of polymer concentrations . Using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations , we also elucidate the molecular mechanism for the spontaneous curvatures obtained here and conclude that these curvatures are generated by the weak adsorption of PEG chains onto the membranes , with a binding free energy of about 4 kJ / mol or 1 . 6 k B T per chain , and that the curvature ratio m Ld / m Lo ≃ 4 . 7 is approximately equal to the ratio κ Lo / κ Ld of the corresponding bending rigidities . Our approach to deduce the spontaneous curvature from the observed tubulation process is quite general and can be extended to other membrane systems of interest . Two examples are provided by polymer bilayers or polymer - somes 11 , 14 − 16 and by the adsorption of proteins 17 , 18 or peptides 19 onto lipid membranes . Accurate estimates for the spontaneous curvature are also crucial in order to determine the critical particle sizes for the engulfment of nanoparticles by membranes and vesicles . 20 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Tubulation of Vesicles Induced by Osmotic De ﬂ ation . Giant unilamellar vesicles were prepared from ternary lipid mixtures of dioleoylphosphatidylcholine ( DOPC ) , dipalmitoyl - phosphatidylcholine ( DPPC ) , and cholesterol , see Methods . The vesicles were formed in aqueous polymer mixtures of PEG and dextran , which undergo phase separation into two aqueous phases , a PEG - rich and a dextran - rich phase , when the polymer weight fractions exceed a few weight percent 13 , 21 , 22 ( Figure 2a , b ) . Two types of lipid compositions were studied corresponding to a ﬂ exible Ld and a more rigid Lo membrane . 23 − 25 The Ld membranes were ﬂ uorescently labeled by a red dye , the Lo membranes by a green one ( Figure 2c , d and Supporting Information Movies ) . Our experiments started with spherical vesicles that enclosed a homogeneous polymer solution ( composition 0 in Figure 2b ) . These vesicles were then de ﬂ ated osmotically by using exterior solutions that contained ﬁ xed weight fractions of the two polymers but an increasing amount of sucrose . The subsequent de ﬂ ation steps are depicted in Figure 2b and described in more detail in Table S1 . After the ﬁ rst de ﬂ ation step , the interior polymer solution still formed a uniform aqueous phase ( composition 1 ) , corresponding to the VM - A morphology in Figure 1 . After the second and all subsequent de ﬂ ation steps , the interior solution underwent phase separation into a PEG - rich and a dextran - rich phase which formed two aqueous droplets within the vesicles . The shapes of these droplets could be directly imaged by di ﬀ erential interference contrast and ﬂ uorescence microscopy , see Figure S1 . The PEG - rich droplet was always in contact with the membranes , whereas the dextran - rich droplet came into contact with the Ld and Lo membranes only after the third and fourth de ﬂ ation step , respectively . Therefore , the Ld membranes were completely wetted by the PEG - rich phase for composition 2 , while the Lo membranes exhibited the same type of wetting for compositions 2 and 3 , corresponding to the VM - B morphology in Figure 1 . Subsequent de ﬂ ation steps led to the VM - C morphology with partial membrane wetting and nonzero contact angles . Each osmotic de ﬂ ation step reduces the vesicle volume and , thus , increases the area - to - volume ratio of the vesicle . In the absence of polymers , vesicles undergo smooth shape trans - formations from spherical toward prolate shapes as studied previously 26 , 27 for one - component membranes . In contrast to such conventional shape transformations , the vesicles studied here still assumed a spherical shape after the initial de ﬂ ation steps , both for the ﬂ exible Ld membranes ( Figure 2c ) and for Figure 1 . Three nanotube patterns corresponding to the distinct vesicle morphologies VM - A , VM - B , and VM - C observed along the de ﬂ ation path : Schematic views of horizontal xy - scans ( top row ) and of vertical xz - scans ( bottom row ) across the de ﬂ ated vesicles . In all cases , the tubes are ﬁ lled with external medium ( white ) . For the VM - A morphology , the interior polymer solution is uniform ( green ) , whereas it is phase separated ( blue - yellow ) for the morphologies VM - B and VM - C , with complete and partial wetting , respectively , of the membrane by the PEG - rich aqueous phase ( yellow ) . For the VM - B morphology , the nanotubes explore the whole PEG - rich ( yellow ) droplet but stay away from the dextran - rich ( blue ) one . For the VM - C morphology , the nanotubes adhere to the interface between the two aqueous droplets forming a thin and crowded layer along this interface . The di ﬀ erent nanotube patterns can be most easily visualized by three - dimensional confocal scans of the vesicles , see Supporting Movies .

However , because the vesicle volume was reduced by the de ﬂ ation , the vesicle shapes had an apparent area A app that was smaller than the initial vesicle area A 0 . As shown in Figure 3a , this apparent area decreased by about 7 % , 3 % , and 2 . 5 % during the ﬁ rst , second , and third de ﬂ ation step , respectively . The missing membrane area , A = A 0 − A app , was stored in nanotubes that protruded into the vesicle interior . This tube formation was observed for both types of membranes and for all three vesicle morphologies ( Figure 2c , d ) . For the VM - A and VM - B morphologies , the tubes underwent strong thermally excited undulations and we had to analyze the whole three - dimensional stack of confocal scans in order to estimate the length of the tubes . Examples are provided by the Movies Ld _ 1 and Ld _ 2 , which display an Ld vesicle after the ﬁ rst and second de ﬂ ation step , respectively , and Figure 2 .

ACS Nano Article DOI : 10 . 1021 / acsnano . 5b05377 ACS Nano 2016 , 10 , 463 − 474 465 43 reveal that the Ld tubes were quite long , of the order of 20 μ m . For the VM - C morphologies , longer tube segments can be recognized in a single image because the tubes were then localized close to the pd interface between the PEG - rich and the dextran - rich droplet , see Movie Ld _ 4 . This localization is a direct consequence of partial membrane wetting which favors adhesion of the tubes to the pd interface . Thus , the complete - to - partial wetting transition can be directly deduced from the observed remodelling of the nanotubes which explore the whole PEG - rich droplet for the VM - B but adhere to the pd interface for the VM - C morphology , see Figure 4 . Because the de ﬂ ation path was close to the critical consolute point , the tension Σ pd of the pd interface was rather low and varied between 0 . 1 and 10 μ N / m , see Figure 3b . For the VM - C morphology , i . e . , for partial wetting of the membranes by the two phases , the pd interface forms a contact line with the membrane and the resulting geometry can be characterized by e ﬀ ective contact angles as de ﬁ ned in Figure S3 . The variation of these contact angles with the osmotic de ﬂ ation is displayed in Figure 3c . Nucleation and Growth of Necklace - like Tubes . The tubes of the Lo membranes were su ﬃ ciently thick to determine their shapes directly from the confocal images . The three - dimensional scans in the Movies Lo _ 1 and Lo _ 2 show that each Lo vesicle contains many necklace - like tubes consisting of quasi - spherical membrane beads connected by thin membrane necks . The presence of these tubes can be understood from the competition of two kinetic pathways which are related to two di ﬀ erent bifurcations of the vesicle shape . Initial de ﬂ ation of a spherical vesicle leads , via an oblate - stomatocyte bifurcation , 26 to the formation of a single spherical bud protruding into the vesicle interior , corresponding to the shape L sto in Figure 5 . Upon further volume reduction , the vesicle can follow two alternative pathways depending on the lipid ﬂ ow through the narrow membrane neck between the bud and the mother vesicle . If this ﬂ ow is relatively fast , the bud grows in size until it transforms , via a sphere - to - prolate bifurcation , into a short necklace of two identical spheres , corresponding to the shape L [ 2 ] in Figure 5 . As we continue to de ﬂ ate the vesicle , the “ fast - ﬂ ow ” pathway acts to elongate the necklace - like tube which then passes through the necklace - like shapes L [ n ] that consist of an increasing number n of small spheres connected by thin membrane necks , see Figure 5 . The energy landscape in Figure 5a and the tube shapes in Figure 5b have been obtained by minimizing the bending energy of the membrane , see Methods and Section S1 . On the other hand , if the lipid ﬂ ow through the neck is relatively slow or blocked , the mother vesicle uses the released excess area to form a second bud . Therefore , the de ﬂ ation of the vesicle generates new buds via the “ slow - ﬂ ow ” pathway which are then elongated into necklace - like tubes via the “ fast - ﬂ ow ” pathway . Necklace − Cylinder Coexistence and Critical Tube Length . Even though the vast majority of the Lo tubes were necklace - like , we also observed cylindrical tubes for the VM - C morphology of Lo membranes . Somewhat surprisingly , both necklace - like and cylindrical tubes were found to coexist on the same vesicle . One example is provided by the Lo _ 4 vesicle displayed in Figure 6 and Movie Lo _ 4 . Close inspection of these confocal images reveals the existence of two long cylindrical tubes that spiral around the spherical cap of the pd interface . These observations can be understood from the competition of di ﬀ erent energy contributions which favor necklace - like tubes below a certain critical tube length and cylindrical tubes above this length . At the critical tube length , the necklace - like tube transforms into a cylindrical one . Such a transformation can proceed in a continuous manner via intermediate unduloids as shown in Figure 7 . For the VM - A and VM - B morphologies , the existence of a critical tube length can be understood intuitively from the following simple argument . A necklace - like tube consisting of small spheres with radius R ss = 1 / | m | as depicted in Figure 7a has vanishing bending energy . The main body of a cylindrical tube with radius R cy = 1 / ( 2 | m | ) as displayed in Figure 7c also has vanishing bending energy , but the cylinder must be closed by two end - caps which have a ﬁ nite bending energy . Therefore , the bending energy of the membrane disfavors the cylindrical tube . On the other hand , the necklace - like tube has a larger volume compared to the cylindrical one and the osmotic pressure di ﬀ erence across the membranes acts to compress the tubes when they protrude into the interior solution inside the vesicles . 8 Therefore , such a tube can lower its energy by Figure 4 . Nanotube patterns within Ld vesicles as observed for the VM - B and VM - C morphologies corresponding to complete and partial wetting of the membranes . ( a ) Disordered pattern corresponding to an xy scan ( with z = 31 μ m ) of the VM - B morphology after the second de ﬂ ation step . Because the Ld membrane is completely wetted by the PEG - rich phase , the nanotubes explore the whole PEG - rich droplet but stay away from the dextran - rich phase . ( b ) Layer of densely packed tubes as visible in an xy scan ( with z = 22 . 5 μ m ) of the VM - C morphology after the fourth de ﬂ ation step . As a result of partial wetting , the nanotubes now adhere to the pd interface between the two aqueous droplets and form a thin layer in which crowding leads to short - range orientational order of the tubes . Note that the tube layer is only partially visible because the pd interface is curved into a spherical cap . ACS Nano Article DOI : 10 . 1021 / acsnano . 5b05377 ACS Nano 2016 , 10 , 463 − 474 466 44 reducing its volume which favors the cylindrical tube . The volume work is proportional to the tube length whereas the bending energy of the end - caps is independent of this length . It then follows from the competition between these two energies that short tubes are necklace - like whereas long tubes are cylindrical . The same conclusion is obtained from the systematic theory in Section S1 which predicts that an individual necklace - like tube transforms into a cylindrical one when the length of the necklace reaches the critical value L tu * and that this critical length lies within the interval 2 . 84 R 0 < L tu * < 3 R 0 for the observed VM - A and VM - B morphologies where π ≡ R A / ( 4 ) 0 0 represents the radius of the initial vesicle with area A 0 . The upper bound 3 R 0 for the critical tube length is universal and applies to a vesicle with a single tube , whereas the lower bound 2 . 84 R 0 applies to a vesicle with an arbitrary number of tubes and follows from the observed reduction of the apparent vesicle area during the ﬁ rst two de ﬂ ation steps . The critical tube area of a single tube is then given by 2 π L tu * / | m | which is about 6 π R 0 / | m | . These bounds for the VM - A and VM - B morphologies agree with the observed necklace - like shapes of the Lo tubes which are all shorter than the critical tube length . The Ld tubes are about 5 times longer than the Lo tubes , but they are still shorter than the critical tube length . On the basis of the latter observation and the high ﬂ exibility of the Ld tubes , see further below , we conclude that the Ld tubes for the VM - A and VM - B morphologies have a necklace - like shape as well . For the VM - C morphology , the nanotubes adhere to the pd interface . In this case , the critical tube length is determined by the interplay between ( i ) the adhesion energy which is proportional to tube length and favors the cylindrical tube and ( ii ) the bending energy of the end - caps for the cylindrical tube which disfavors the latter tube . The systematic theory in Section S2 now leads to a critical tube length L ad * that depends on four material parameters , namely the bending rigidity , the spontaneous curvature , the interfacial tension of the pd interface , and the intrinsic contact angle , as described by eq S47 and Figure S4 . All of these parameters have been determined experimentally and two of them are found to vary signi ﬁ cantly along the de ﬂ ation path which implies a corresponding variation of the critical tube length L ad * . The values for the Ld _ 4 and the Lo _ 4 vesicle , for example , are given by 5 . 6 and 21 . 4 μ m , respectively ( Figure S4d ) . The latter value agrees with the length of the cylindrical tubes as observed for the Lo membranes . When we compare the length of individual tubes in Movie Ld _ 4 with the critical length of 5 . 6 μ m , we conclude that the Ld tubes have a cylindrical shape for this VM - C morphology . Spontaneous Curvature from Image Analysis . For the Lo membranes , the spontaneous curvature can be directly estimated from the shape of the tubes . As mentioned , all Lo tubes found for the VM - A and VM - B morphologies were relatively short and necklace - like which implies that the spontaneous curvature can be estimated via m = − 1 / ⟨ R ss ⟩ with the average radius ⟨ R ss ⟩ of the small , quasi - spherical beads . For the Lo _ 1 vesicle after the ﬁ rst de ﬂ ation step , for example , this direct shape analysis leads to ⟨ R ss ⟩ = 0 . 72 μ m and to the spontaneous curvature m = − 1 . 4 μ m − 1 . All m - values obtained in this manner are displayed in Figure 8a as green stars . These values have an accuracy of about 20 % , re ﬂ ecting the relative standard deviation of the measured bead radius R ss . The direct shape analysis was also applied to the cylindrical and necklace - like tubes coexisting on the Lo _ 4 vesicle , see Figure 6 . The average diameter ⟨ 2 R cy ⟩ of the cylindrical tubes as obtained from the confocal scans ( Figure 6d , e ) implies the spontaneous curvature m = − 1 / ⟨ 2 R cy ⟩ which leads to m = − 1 . 82 μ m − 1 for the cylindrical tubes on the Lo _ 4 vesicle , with an accuracy of about ± 13 % corresponding to the relative standard deviation of the measured diameter of the cylinders ( Figure 6f ) . For the latter vesicle , the average bead diameter of the necklace - like tubes leads to m = − 1 . 56 μ m − 1 with an accuracy of about ± 19 % ( Figure 6g ) . The good agreement Figure 5 . Formation and growth of necklace - like tube . ( a ) Energy landscape with di ﬀ erent branches of equilibrium shapes as a function of the reduced vesicle volume v . The latter volume has the value v = 1 for a spherical shape and continuously decreases during de ﬂ ation , see Methods . The energy di ﬀ erence Δ E describes the de ﬂ ation - induced reduction in bending energy compared to the initial spherical vesicle . The eight vertical lines labeled from 1 to 8 ( top ) describe eight discrete de ﬂ ation steps . ( b ) Shapes of necklace - like tube corresponding to the eight vertical lines in panel a . The short vertical line on the left end of the tubes corresponds to a short segment of the mother vesicle which is connected to each tube by a thin membrane neck . As we de ﬂ ate the initial vesicle with v = 1 , we move along the 1 - necklace branch ( red ) that begins at the limit shape L sto with bead radius R ss ≈ 1 / ( 2 | m | ) and v = 0 . 9997 . After passing the shape L [ 1 ] with R ss = 1 / | m | and v = 0 . 9987 , we reach the reduced volume v = 0 . 9982 at which the 1 - necklace branch crosses the 2 - necklace branch ( blue ) . For the latter v - value , a 1 - necklace coexists with an open 2 - necklace . Further de ﬂ ation leads to the 2 - necklace L [ 2 ] with a closed neck at v = 0 . 9975 and , subsequently , to the 3 - necklace branch ( orange ) and the 4 - necklace branch ( green ) . The dashed and solid segments of the free energy landscape in panel a correspond to tubes with closed and open necks , respectively . The parameters used in this example belong to the Lo _ 1 vesicle with size R 0 = 20 . 7 μ m and spontaneous curvature m = − 1 . 67 μ m − 1 as obtained from the area partitioning analysis .

For the Ld membranes , we could not resolve the shapes of the nanotubes because they had a thickness below optical resolution . However , we could still deduce the spontaneous curvature from two geometric quantities that can be directly determined from the confocal scans : the total tube area A = A 0 − A app and the total tube length L . The latter length can be directly estimated from the three - dimensional confocal scans , see Movies Ld _ j , with an uncertainty of about ± 15 % . Indeed , all tubes with constant mean curvature are then characterized by spontaneous curvatures within the interval − 2 π L / A ≤ m ≤ − π L / A ( Figure S5 ) . Furthermore , if a fraction Λ of the total tube length is cylindrical and the remaining fraction 1 − Λ is necklace - like , we obtain the estimate π π = − − Λ = − − Λ − m L A L A A ( 2 ) ( 2 ) ( area partitioning ) 0 app ( 1 ) For the VM - A and VM - B morphologies of the Lo membranes , all tubes had a necklace - like shape which implies Λ = 0 . After the ﬁ rst de ﬂ ation step of the Lo vesicle , for example , we measured the excess area A = 354 μ m 2 and the overall tube length L = 94 μ m which leads , via eq 1 with Λ = 0 , to the spontaneous curvature m = − 1 . 67 μ m − 1 . For the VM - C morphologies , on the other hand , tube adhesion can lead to some cylindrical tubes and nonzero Λ - values ( Table S2 ) . The m - values obtained via eq 1 are displayed in Figure 8a as green Figure 6 .

Therefore , the direct shape analysis of the cylindrical and necklace - like tubes leads to the estimates m = − 1 / ( 2 R cy ) = − 1 . 82 ± 0 . 24 μ m − 1 and m = − 1 / R ss = − 1 . 56 ± 0 . 30 μ m − 1 .

Low energy transformation of a necklace - like tube into a capped cylinder : all three tubes have the same surface area and , apart from the end - caps , the same mean curvature M which is equal to the spontaneous curvature m .

The transformation of the sphere - necklace into the cylinder proceeds via a continuous family of intermediate unduloids . During this transformation , the tube volume is reduced by a factor 3 / 4 . Apart from their end - caps , the unduloids and the cylinder have the same bending energy as the sphere - necklace . All curvatures are negative because the tubes protrude into the interior aqueous compartments of the vesicles .

For the Ld tubes , we could not estimate the fraction Λ from the confocal scans . However , the high ﬂ exibility of these tubes as observed for the VM - A and VM - B morphologies provides strong evidence that these tubes were necklace - like as well . The tube ﬂ exibility can be characterized by the persistence length for tube bending . Using the parameter values for the Ld membranes , we then ﬁ nd that a cylindrical tube has a persistence length of 15 μ m ( Section S3 ) , whereas the persistence length of the corresponding necklace - like tube should be comparable to the diameter of the small spheres . Inspection of the Movies Ld _ 1 and Ld _ 2 reveals that the thermal ﬂ uctuations of the Ld tubes lead to hairpin - like conformations with curvature radii of the order of 2 μ m which implies a persistence length below 2 μ m . Such an upper bound for the persistence length is consistent with a necklace - like but not with a cylindrical tube morphology . As mentioned , the same conclusion is obtained from the observed tube lengths which are shorter than the critical tube lengths for the necklace - cylinder transformation . Therefore , we estimated the sponta - neous curvatures for the VM - A and VM - B morphologies of the Ld membranes using eq 1 with Λ = 0 . The spontaneous curvature of the Ld _ 1 vesicle , for example , is then found to be m = − 1 / ( 125 nm ) . For the VM - C morphologies of the Ld membranes , we deduced the total tube length L from the density of the tubes at the pd interface and estimated the spontaneous curvature via eq 1 using the value Λ = ± 1 2 1 2 , thereby taking the whole range 0 ≤ Λ ≤ 1 of possible Λ - values into account . For the VM - C morphologies of both the Lo and the Ld membranes , the values of the spontaneous curvature as deduced from the direct shape and the area partitioning analysis could be validated via a third , completely di ﬀ erent mode of analysis . The latter mode is based on the interfacial tension Σ pd of the pd interface ( Figure 3b ) as well as on the e ﬀ ective contact angles ( Figure 3c ) . 7 Using these quantities and the force balance along the contact line , we computed the membrane tensions in the two segments ( Figure 8b ) and the spontaneous curvature via κ θ θ = − Σ ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ m 2 sin ( ) sin ( ) ( force balance ) pd d e 1 / 2 ( 2 ) With the use of the measured bending rigidities for the Ld and Lo membranes , the expression given by eq 2 leads to m - values that are in good agreement with those obtained via the two other modes of analysis , see open squares in Figure 8a . Spontaneous Curvature Generated by PEG Adsorp - tion . Because vesicle tubulation was only observed in the presence of the polymers , the spontaneous curvature of the vesicle membranes must arise from the polymer - membrane interactions . If these interactions are e ﬀ ectively attractive or repulsive , the polymers form adsorption or depletion layers on the two bilayer lea ﬂ ets . The membrane then prefers to bulge toward the solutions with the higher and lower concentrations for polymer adsorption and depletion , respectively . 29 After the ﬁ rst de ﬂ ation step , both the PEG and the dextran concentrations in the interior aqueous solution are larger than in the exterior solution ( Figure 2a ) . After the second and all subsequent de ﬂ ation steps , the PEG concentration in the interior PEG - rich phase is again larger than in the exterior solution , but the dextran concentration in the interior phase is now smaller than in this exterior solution ( Figure 2a ) . Furthermore , all de ﬂ ation steps lead to a negative spontaneous curvature of the membranes . These observations are only consistent with the theoretical results in ref 29 if the spontaneous curvature is induced by PEG adsorption . The latter conclusion has been con ﬁ rmed by additional experiments in which we used the same lipid composition but exposed the vesicles to aqueous solutions that contained only PEG and no dextran , see Figure 9 . For the latter systems , osmotic de ﬂ ation of the vesicles again generated membrane nanotubes that protruded into the solution with the higher PEG concentration . To corroborate these conclusions about PEG adsorption and to obtain direct insight into the conformations of the adsorbed PEG molecules , we performed molecular dynamics simulations of the polymer − lipid systems with atomistic resolution for the experimentally used lipid compositions and chain length of PEG , see Methods . Typical conformations of adsorbed chains are displayed in Figure 10a , b for both Ld and Lo membranes . These conformations indicate that the PEG molecules are only Figure 8 . Variation of deduced membrane parameters with osmotic de ﬂ ation : in all panels , the red and green data correspond to the Ld and Lo membranes , respectively , and the vertical dashed line to the critical concentration c cr . ( a ) Absolute value of the spontaneous curvature in contact with the uniform aqueous phase ( data for c / c 0 = 1 . 120 ) and with the PEG - rich aqueous phase ( data for c / c 0 ≥ 1 . 174 ) . The data were obtained by direct shape analysis of the nanotubes ( green stars ) , area partitioning analysis as given by eq 1 ( open circles ) , and force balance analysis described by eq 2 ( open squares ) . The horizontal dotted line corresponds to the optical resolution limit of 1 / ( 300 nm ) .

For comparison , the interfacial tension Σ pd is also included ( blue crosses and solid black line ) . ( c ) Intrinsic contact angle θ in between the pd interface and the vesicle membrane as de ﬁ ned in Figure S3c . The intrinsic contact angle is obtained from the e ﬀ ective contact angles via cos ( θ in ) = [ sin ( θ p ) − sin ( θ d ) ] / sin ( θ e ) . 28 Note that the intrinsic contact angle , which represents a material parameter , varies rather smoothly with the polymer concentration , in contrast to the e ﬀ ective contact angles in Figure 3c . ACS Nano Article DOI : 10 . 1021 / acsnano . 5b05377 ACS Nano 2016 , 10 , 463 − 474 469 47 weakly bound , with relatively short contact segments ( or “ trains ” ) , and relatively long loops in between . The two terminal OH groups of the PEG molecule were frequently bound to the membrane via hydrogen bonds . In addition , a small number of contacts was formed between the polymer backbones and the membranes . Combining both types of contacts , the adsorbed polymers formed an average number of 4 . 5 ± 2 . 3 and 3 . 2 ± 2 . 1 contacts with the Ld and the Lo membranes , respectively . A more quantitative measure for the a ﬃ nity of the polymers to the membranes is provided by the potentials of mean force displayed in Figure 10c , d . These potentials indicate that the PEG molecules have essentially the same a ﬃ nity for both types of membranes , with a binding free energy of about 4 kJ / mol or 1 . 6 k B T per polymer chain . Discussion of Deduced Spontaneous Curvatures . The spontaneous curvatures displayed in Figure 8a have two remarkable features : ( i ) they depend only weakly on the total polymer concentration c within the vesicles ; and ( ii ) when exposed to the same asymmetric environment , the spontaneous curvature of the Ld membrane is about 4 . 7 times larger than that of the Lo membrane . The second feature is relatively easy to explain . Indeed , the spontaneous curvature generated by adsorption is theoretically predicted to be inversely propor - tional to the bending rigidity of the membrane 8 , 29 as recently con ﬁ rmed for the adsorption of small molecules by molecular dynamics simulations . 30 If we assume that the PEG chains have similar a ﬃ nities to the Ld and Lo membranes as implied by our simulation results ( Figure 10c , d ) , the ratio m Ld / m Lo of the spontaneous curvatures should be equal to the ratio κ Lo / κ Ld of the bending rigidities . The latter rigidity ratio is estimated to be κ Lo / κ Ld ≃ 4 . 5 , based on the experimental results in ref 25 , which should be compared with the curvature ratio m Ld / m Lo ≃ 4 . 7 in Figure 8a . Because the experimental uncertainty is of the order of 10 to 20 % for both ratios , the data are consistent with m Ld / m Lo ≃ κ Lo / κ Ld and , thus , with a comparable amount of adsorbed polymers on both types of membranes , in agreement with our simulation results . The weak dependence of the spontaneous curvatures on the polymer concentration c within the vesicles is more di ﬃ cult to understand . Because the polymer weight fractions in the exterior solution were kept constant during all de ﬂ ation steps , the concentration - dependence of the spontaneous curvatures follows from the concentration - dependence of the PEG coverage on the inner membrane lea ﬂ ets in contact with the interior polymer solutions . If these lea ﬂ ets were in contact with dilute PEG solutions , the polymer density within the adsorption layer would be increased by a factor of about exp [ Δ F ch / k B T ] ≃ 5 compared to the bulk density , based on the binding free energy Δ F ch ≃ 1 . 6 k B T for a single PEG chain ( Figure 10c , d ) . Therefore , as the polymer concentration within the interior solution is increased , the PEG coverage on the interior lea ﬂ ets of the membranes would also be increased which implied a corresponding increase of the spontaneous curvature . However , for the de ﬂ ation path studied here , the PEG − dextran solutions were not dilute but semidilute , with substantial overlaps between the chains , see Table S3 , which led to repulsive PEG − dextran interactions in the one - phase region and to repulsive PEG − PEG interactions in the PEG - rich phase . When the PEG chains are adsorbed onto the inner lea ﬂ et , the local PEG concentration is increased and the PEG chains must experience even more repulsive PEG − PEG and PEG − dextran interactions than in the bulk solutions . For adsorption onto solid surfaces , repulsive chain − chain inter - actions typically lead to a saturation of the polymer coverage as observed in many experiments , see , e . g . , refs 31 − 33 . In the present context , such a saturation of the PEG coverage is quite plausible after the third de ﬂ ation step . Furthermore , after the ﬁ rst and the second de ﬂ ation step , the interior polymer solutions were rather close to the critical consolute point with ϵ ≡ | c − c cr | / c cr of the order of 10 − 2 ( Table S3 ) . In such a situation , the correlation length for compositional ﬂ uctuations is expected to be large compared to the size of the PEG chains which implies a thickening of the adsorption layers and a corresponding increase in the PEG coverage on the inner membrane lea ﬂ ets . Thus , the weak concentration - dependence of this coverage should arise from the antagonistic e ﬀ ects of near - critical ﬂ uctuations and repulsive chain − chain interactions along the chosen de ﬂ ation path . CONCLUSIONS In summary , we have shown that both Ld and Lo membranes form nanotubes when their lea ﬂ ets are exposed to two aqueous polymer solutions that di ﬀ er in their composition . The total length of the tubes is controlled by the osmotic de ﬂ ation , while their thickness directly re ﬂ ects the bilayer asymmetry of the membranes as described by their spontaneous curvature . The vast majority of individual Lo nanotubes had a necklace - like shape ( Figure 2 as well as Figure S2 and Movies ) , but we also observed long cylindrical tubes coexisting with shorter necklace - like tubes on the same vesicle ( Figure 6 and Movie Lo _ 4 ) . The formation of many necklace - like tubes can be understood from the competition of two kinetic pathways . The ﬁ rst pathway nucleates new buds of the mother vesicle whereas Figure 9 . Nanotubes formed in Ld ( red ) and Lo ( green ) vesicles exposed to aqueous solutions of PEG and sucrose , i . e . , in the absence of dextran . The interior solution contained only PEG and no sucrose with the initial weight fraction w p = 0 . 0443 . The vesicles were de ﬂ ated by exchanging the external medium by a hypertonic solution with no PEG but an increasing weight fraction w su of sucrose . The vesicles in ( a ) and ( c ) are obtained for w su = 0 . 0066 , those in ( b ) and ( d ) for w su = 0 . 01 . The corresponding osmolarity ratios P e / P 0 are 1 . 05 and 1 . 61 , respectively . The white scale bars are 10 μ m in all panels . ACS Nano Article DOI : 10 . 1021 / acsnano . 5b05377 ACS Nano 2016 , 10 , 463 − 474 470 48 the second pathway stores additional area in the existing buds and extends these buds into necklace - like tubes ( Figure 5b ) . These necklace - like tubes transform into cylindrical tubes when their length reaches a certain critical length ( Sections S1 and S2 ) . It then follows from the magnitude of the critical tube lengths that individual Ld tubes were necklace - like for the VM - A and VM - B morphologies but cylindrical for some of the VM - C morphologies . In the latter case , the tube adhesion led to a reduction of the critical tube length . To deduce the spontaneous curvature from the observed vesicle morphologies , we used three di ﬀ erent and independent methods of image analysis : direct shape analysis ( Figure 6 ) , overall partitioning analysis of membrane area ( eq 1 ) , and force balance analysis along the contact line of the partially wetted membranes ( eq 2 ) . All three analysis methods gave very consistent values for the spontaneous curvature m as summarized in Figure 8a . The spontaneous curvatures of the Ld and Lo membranes were fairly constant over the range of polymer concentrations studied here , with m Ld ≃ − 8 μ m − 1 and m Lo ≃ − 1 . 7 μ m − 1 which implies the curvature ratio m Ld / m Lo ≃ 4 . 7 . We also elucidated the molecular mechanism for the generation of the spontaneous curvatures and showed that these curvatures are induced by the weak adsorption of PEG molecules onto the membranes . Indeed , the formation of nanotubes was also observed in the absence of dextran , e . g . , when the giant vesicles were exposed to aqueous solutions of PEG alone ( Figure 9 ) . In addition , both the typical conformations of the adsorbed polymers and the associated polymer - membrane a ﬃ nities were determined by atomistic molecular dynamics simulations ( Figure 10 ) . The binding free energies were found to be relatively small and similar in size for Ld and Lo membranes , about 4 kJ / mol or 1 . 6 k B T per polymer chain . Because of this similarity , the curvature ratio m Ld / m Lo is approximately equal to the rigidity ratio κ Lo / κ Ld . Our study can be extended in several ways . First , it will be useful to further corroborate our preliminary results for dilute PEG solutions ( Figure 9 ) in order to avoid the added complexity of semidilute polymer mixtures . Second , using other lipid or polymer compositions with di ﬀ erent bending rigidities or polymer - membrane a ﬃ nities , we can easily vary the tube thickness and , in particular , produce thinner and longer nanotubes which should then exhibit a larger fraction of cylinders . Third , using osmotic de ﬂ ation in combination with micropipette aspiration to shorten the tubes 7 and / or optical tweezers to extend individual tubes , one should be able to directly probe the dynamics of the necklace - cylinder trans - formation . Because our de ﬂ ation - based approach is both simple and general , it can be applied to other membrane systems of interest . One example is provided by synthetic lipid bilayers with two lea ﬂ ets that have di ﬀ erent compositions as recently produced by a variety of preparation methods . 34 − 38 With the use of similar methods , it should also be possible to produce Figure 10 . Typical conformation and potential of mean force for adsorbed PEG molecules . ( a and b ) Simulation snapshots of PEG molecule adsorbed onto Ld and Lo bilayer . The Ld and Lo composition is the same as in Figure 2 . The color code for the lipids is blue for DOPC , orange for DPPC , and red for cholesterol . The PEG molecules consist of 180 monomers corresponding to the average molecular weight used in the experiments . Each lipid membrane is immersed in about 27 000 water molecules ( not shown ) . ( c and d ) Potential of mean force ( PMF ) for Ld and Lo membranes as a function of the separation z between the polymer ’ s center - of - mass and the bilayer ’ s midplane . The potential wells are relatively broad , with a width of about 4 nm , because the polymer end groups can adsorb even for relatively large z - values . The binding free energy of a single PEG chain is about 4 kJ / mol or 1 . 6 k B T for both types of membranes . ACS Nano Article DOI : 10 . 1021 / acsnano . 5b05377 ACS Nano 2016 , 10 , 463 − 474 471 49 bilayers of block copolymers with such a compositional asymmetry . Block copolymer bilayers form giant polymer - somes 14 which change their shapes in response to osmotic de ﬂ ation 15 , 16 , 39 and can form tubular shapes as well . 11 Furthermore , our approach can also be used to determine the spontaneous curvature arising from the membrane binding of BAR - domain proteins 17 , 18 and amphipathic peptides . 19 In the living cell , the membranes are continuously remodelled by the formation of transport vesicles via ﬁ ssion and fusion processes . The magnitude of the spontaneous curvature determines whether these remodelling processes are endergonic or exergonic . If the spontaneous curvature is comparable to the inverse size of the transport vesicle , budding is exergonic and fusion is endergonic . One example for the latter situation is provided by clathrin - dependent endocytosis for which the spontaneous curvature plays a pivotal role . 20 METHODS Materials . Dextran ( 400 − 500 kg / mol ) and poly ( ethylene glycol ) ( PEG 8000 , 8 kg / mol ) were purchased from Sigma - Aldrich . The polydispersity , measured with gel permeation chromatography , was 1 . 11 for PEG and 1 . 83 for dextran . The binodal of the polymer solution was determined by cloud - point titration . 22 The critical consolute ( or demixing ) point was located at a total polymer concentration of 8 . 12 wt % with a dextran to PEG weight ratio w d / w p = 1 . 25 . The interfacial tensions Σ pd between the dextran - rich and PEG - rich phases were measured using a SITE100 spinning drop tensiometer ( Kru ̈ ss ) as described in ref 22 . Dioleoylphosphatidylcho - line ( DOPC ) and dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine ( DPPC ) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids and cholesterol from Sigma - Aldrich . Texas Red labeled dihexadecanoyl phosphoethanolamine ( DHPE - TR ) was purchased from Invitrogen and distearoyl phosphoethanolamine - N - [ poly ( ethylene glycol ) 2000 - N ′ - carboxy ﬂ uor - escein ] ( DSPE - PEG - CF ) from Avanti Polar Lipids . Vesicle Preparation and De ﬂ ation . Aqueous polymer solutions with initial weight fraction ( w d , w p ) 0 = ( 0 . 0390 , 0 . 0312 ) corresponding to composition 0 ( blue cross in Figure 2a , b ) were encapsulated within giant vesicles with membranes composed of DOPC , DPPC and cholesterol . The latter vesicles were formed using the electroformation method as described elsewhere . 7 The Ld membranes with lipid composition DOPC : DPPC : cholesterol = 64 : 15 : 21 were labeled by 0 . 1 mol % DHPE - TR . The Lo membranes with lipid composition DOPC : DPPC : cholesterol = 13 : 44 : 43 were labeled with 0 . 2 mol % DSPE - PEG - CF . For these two lipid compositions , the bending rigidities were previously studied ; we used the values κ Ld = 0 . 82 × 10 − 19 J and κ Lo = 3 . 69 × 10 − 19 J obtained in ref 25 . After preparation , the vesicles were transferred into a chamber ﬁ lled with an isotonic solution with polymer weight fractions ( w d , w p ) 0 e = ( 0 . 0327 , 0 . 0327 ) , corresponding to the green cross in Figure 2a , b . The de ﬂ ation was done by exchanging the external medium with a hypertonic solution containing the constant polymer weight fractions w d = 0 . 0327 and w p = 0 . 0327 and an increasing weight fraction of sucrose . These conditions ensured that the vesicles sedimented toward the coverslip at the bottom of the chamber and that the symmetry axis was oriented perpendicular to this coverslip ; see Figure 2c , d and Figure S2a , b . Confocal Microscopy . Vesicles were observed by a confocal microscope ( Leica TCS SP5 ) with a 63 × water immersion objective ( N . A . = 1 . 20 ) . The images were deconvoluted by Huygens Professional software ( version 4 . 3 . 1 , Scientic Volume Imaging ) , and analyzed using home - developed software in Matlab to determine the contours of the mother vesicle and the membrane nanotubes . A complete three - dimensional scan of a vesicle consisted of a stack of 37 − 82 confocal images that were taken at di ﬀ erent separations from the coverslip , see the Movies Ld _ j and Lo _ j which display scans of Ld and Lo vesicles after the ﬁ rst , second , and fourth depletion step . The analysis of these scans is described in more detail in Figure 6 and Table S2 . Computation of Vesicle Shapes via Free Energy Minimiza - tion . For the VM - A and VM - B morphologies , the free energy landscapes of the giant vesicles have been determined by minimizing the bending energy of the vesicle membrane for constant membrane area A 0 and de ﬂ ation - controlled vesicle volume V . The bending energy depends ( i ) on the shape of the vesicle membrane which is described by its ( local ) mean curvature M and ( ii ) on two ﬂ uid - elastic parameters , the bending rigidity κ and the spontaneous curvature m . 26 , 40 The constraints on area and volume are taken into account by two Lagrange multipliers , Σ and Δ P , and by minimizing the shape functional 26 ∫ κ = − + Σ − Δ A A PV d 2 ( M m ) 2 0 (cid:1) ( 3 ) We used the vesicle size R 0 ≡ ( A 0 / 4 π ) 1 / 2 as the basic length scale and the volume - to - area ratio or reduced volume π ≡ ≤ v V R / [ ( 4 / 3 ) ] 1 03 ( 4 ) as the basic control parameter or reaction coordinate , see Sect . S1 for more details . In this way , we obtained the free energy landscape for a giant vesicle with a necklace - like tube as displayed in Figure 5 . For the VM - C morphology , the overall shape of the vesicles can be determined by an appropriate generalization of the shape functional as described in ref 28 . The VM - C shape involves the intrinsic contact angle θ in as an additional material parameter , see Figure S3c . In order to study the adhesion of membrane nanotubes to the pd interface , we ignored the relatively small curvature of the pd interface and calculated the free energies for the adhesion of both necklace - like and cylindrical tubes to a planar pd interface . The results of these calculations are described in Section S2 and summarized in Figure S4 . Molecular Dynamics Simulations of PEG Adsorption . For the atomistic simulations , we used the GROMACS software package 4 . 5 . 5 with the Berger force ﬁ eld 41 for the lipids and parameters based on the GROMOS 53A6 force ﬁ eld for the polymers . 42 For the PEG 8000 polymer chain , this force ﬁ eld leads to a radius of gyration of 3 . 43 nm in reasonable agreement with the value 3 . 83 nm for PEG 8000 as obtained by linear extrapolation from the results in ref 43 and the value 4 . 05 nm as estimated in ref 22 based on the PEO data in ref 44 . Lipid bilayers corresponding to the experimentally used compositions for the Ld and Lo membranes were assembled , together with a single polymer chain of PEG 8000 , in a cubic simulation box of size 10 . 3 × 10 . 3 × 14 . 8 nm 3 with periodic boundary conditions in all three spatial directions for the unrestrained simulations , using the charmm membrane builder . 45 The Ld membrane contained 256 DOPC , 60 DPPC , and 84 cholesterol molecules , whereas the Lo membrane consisted of 52 DOPC , 176 DPPC , and 172 cholesterol molecules ( Figure 10 ) . The PEG 8000 molecules had a length of 180 monomers . Bilayer and polymer were immersed in 27 080 water molecules as described by the SPC water model . Both the Ld and the Lo membranes were simulated for 700 ns . For the computations of the potentials of mean force in Figure 10c , d , we increased the box size perpendicular to the membrane to 20 . 5 nm corresponding to 51 758 water molecules and used 12 umbrella windows , each of which was simulated for 100 ns .

The vesicle membrane has a large and negative spontaneous curvature m which favors highly curved mem - brane segments , in contrast to the small curvature 1 / R 0 of the initial vesicle . When the vesicle volume is reduced by osmotic deﬂation , the membrane can form an ‘ N - shape’ consisting of a large spherical mother vesicle together with a necklace - like tube that protrudes into the vesicle interior . We have determined the N - shapes of minimal bending energy as a function of reduced volume v ≡ V V 0 ≤ 1 with V 0 ≡ 4 π 3 R 30 ( S1 ) where v = 1 corresponds to the spherical mother vesicle without a necklace - like tube . The results of the numerical energy minimization , which are based on the shape functional in Eq . 3 of the main text , are displayed in Fig . 5 . The N - shapes of minimal bending energy contain the shapes L [ N ] for which the necklace consists of N spherical beads with radius R ss = 1 / | m | , see Fig . 5 . Such a necklace - like tube has constant mean curvature M = m and , thus , vanishing bending energy as follows from Eq . 3 of the main text . Furthermore , the mother vesicle has the radius R N = R 0 (cid:7) 1 − N ( | m | R 0 ) 2 < R 0 ( S2 ) as obtained from the conservation of membrane area which has the form A 0 = 4 πR 20 = 4 πR 2 N + N 4 π | m | − 2 . ( S3 ) The necklace is anchored to the mother vesicle by an ideal membrane neck . The latter neck is formed as one approaches the limit shape L sto from the branch of stomatocytes . [ 1 ] Likewise , the L [ N ] - shapes with N ≥ 2 also represent limit shapes which are obtained from necklace - like tubes with open necks , see Fig . 5 . The L [ 1 ] - shape is special because the necklace consists of a single spherical bead ( or bud ) which is obtained from the limit shape L sto by increasing the bead radius from R ss = 1 / ( 2 | m | ) to R ss = 1 / | m | . The L [ N ] - shapes with N ≥ 2 contain two types of ideal necks , the anchor neck between the mother vesicle and the ﬁrst bead as well as the ss - ss necks between the small spheres of the necklace . Both types of membrane necks are stable provided R ss ≥ 1 / | m | [ 2 ] which includes the limiting case R ss = 1 / | m | considered here . The volume of the L [ N ] - shapes is given by V N = 4 π 3 R 3 N − N 4 π 3 R 3ss = V 0 (cid:12)(cid:10) 1 − N ( | m | R 0 ) 2 (cid:11) 3 / 2 − N ( | m | R 0 ) 3 (cid:13) ( S4 ) 2 54 which decreases monotonically with increasing number N of the small beads . There - fore , the sequence of L [ N ] - shapes provides a possible , low - energy pathway for osmotic deﬂation as depicted in Fig . 5 in the main text . Because the bending energy of the necklace - like tube with R ss = 1 / | m | vanishes , the bending energy of the L [ N ] - shapes arises from the mother vesicle alone , i . e . , E be (cid:14) L [ N ] (cid:15) = 8 πκ ( 1 − mR N ) 2 ( S5 ) which is equivalent to E be (cid:14) L [ N ] (cid:15) = 8 πκ (cid:16) 1 + | m | R 0 (cid:7) 1 − N ( | m | R 0 ) 2 (cid:17) 2 . ( S6 ) This energy also decreases monotonically with increasing bead number N , compare Fig . 5 . S1 . 2 Giant vesicle with cylindrical tube We now transform the L [ N ] - shapes as considered in the previous section into alter - native C [ N ] - shapes for which the necklace - like tubes are replaced by cylindrical ones . For each value of N , we perform this transformation in such a way that both the membrane area and the vesicle volume are conserved . The cylindrical tubes consist of cylinders that are closed by two spherical caps , where one of these end caps is connected to the mother vesicle by an ideal neck . The body of such a cylinder has length L cy , radius R cy = 1 / ( 2 | m | ) , and mean curvature M = m which implies that this membrane segment has vanishing bending energy . The radius of the mother vesicle is now denoted by R ls . Because the C [ N ] - shape is required to have the same membrane area as the L [ N ] - shape , the length scales L cy and R ls are related via R 2ls + 1 4 | m | L cy + 1 4 m 2 = R 2 N + N m 2 . ( S7 ) A second relation between these two scales is obtained from the requirement that the C [ N ] - shape and the L [ N ] - shape , which both include the mother vesicle , have the same volume which implies R 3ls − 3 16 m 2 L cy − 1 8 | m | 3 = R 3 N − N | m | 3 . ( S8 ) When we combine the two relations ( S7 ) and ( S8 ) to eliminate L cy , we obtain the implicit equation R 3ls (cid:8) 1 + 3 4 | m | R ls (cid:9) = R 3 N (cid:8) 1 + 3 4 | m | R N (cid:9) − N + 1 / 4 4 | m | 3 ( S9 ) 3 55 for the mother vesicle radius R ls of the C [ N ] - shape where R N can be expressed in terms of R 0 via ( S2 ) . The implicit equation ( S9 ) directly implies that R ls < R N for all positive values of N . Therefore , the C [ N ] - shape has a smaller mother vesicle and the membrane area stored in the cylinder exceeds the area stored in the N - necklace . We now deﬁne the parameter (cid:15) via R ls = R N ( 1 − (cid:15) ) ( S10 ) and consider the limit of large | m | R 0 , in which we obtain the asymptotic equality (cid:15) ≈ N + 1 / 4 12 (cid:8) 1 | m | R 0 (cid:9) 3 ( large | m | R 0 ) ( S11 ) from the implicit equation ( S9 ) . The bending energy of the C [ N ] - shape is equal to E be (cid:14) C [ N ] (cid:15) = 8 πκ ( 1 − mR ls ) 2 + 2 πκ ( S12 ) where the ﬁrst and the second term represents the energy contributions from the mother vesicle and from the two end caps of the cylinder , respectively . S1 . 3 Critical tube length for necklace - cylinder transformation We now compare the bending energy ( S12 ) of the C [ N ] - shape with the bending energy ( S5 ) of the L [ N ] - shape . The mother vesicle of the C [ N ] - shape has the bending energy 8 πκ ( 1 − mR ls ) 2 which is smaller than the bending energy 8 πκ ( 1 − mR N ) 2 of the L [ N ] - shape because R ls < R N and | m | R ls (cid:7) 1 . However , the capped cylinder has the bending energy 2 πκ whereas the necklace has vanishing bending energy . Therefore , when we transform the L [ N ] - shape into the C [ N ] - shape , we reduce the bending energy of the mother vesicle but increase the bending energy of the tube . We now deﬁne the reduced diﬀerence Δ ≡ E be (cid:18) C [ N ] (cid:19) − E be (cid:18) L [ N ] (cid:19) 8 πκ ( S13 ) between the bending energies of the C [ N ] - and the L [ N ] - shape , which has the form Δ = ( 1 + | m | R ls ) 2 + 14 − ( 1 + | m | R N ) 2 ( S14 ) or Δ = | m | ( R ls − R N ) [ 2 + | m | ( R ls + R N ) ] + 14 ( S15 ) Replacing R ls by R N ( 1 − (cid:15) ) , the latter relation becomes Δ = − (cid:15) | m | R N [ 2 + 2 | m | R N − (cid:15) | m | R N ] + 14 . ( S16 ) 4 56 The L [ N ] - shape and the C [ N ] - shape are energetically favored for Δ > 0 and Δ < 0 , respectively . The critical bead number N ∗ and the critical tube length L ∗ tu = N ∗ 2 R ss = N ∗ 2 / | m | ( S17 ) then follow from Δ = 0 . In the limit of large | m | R 0 and small (cid:15) ∼ ( | m | R 0 ) − 3 , see ( S11 ) , we obtain the asymptotic equality Δ ≈ − N + 1 / 4 6 | m | R 0 + 1 4 ( S18 ) which implies the critical tube length L ∗ tu = N ∗ 2 / | m | ≈ 3 R 0 . ( S19 ) It is interesting to note that exactly the same relation for the critical tube length is obtained if one replaces the bending energy contribution from the mother vesicle by the volume work performed on the tube by the pressure diﬀerence Δ P which behaves as Δ P ≈ 4 κm 2 / R ls for large | m | R ls and acts to compress the necklace - like tube which has a larger volume than the cylindrical one . [ 3 ] S1 . 4 Critical tube lengths for mother vesicle with many tubes So far , we have explicitly discussed a mother vesicle with a single tube . However , the above considerations can be easily extended to a mother vesicle with several tubes . Indeed , all we have to do is to select one of the tubes and to redeﬁne the membrane area and the membrane volume in an appropriate manner . Thus , let us label the selected tube by the index s and the remaining tubes by the index r = 1 , 2 , . . . . The selected tube has the area A s , the remaining tubes have the areas A r . The redeﬁned membrane area ˆ A 0 is then given by ˆ A 0 ≡ A 0 − (cid:20) r A r ≡ A mv + A s ( S20 ) with the area A mv of the redeﬁned mother vesicle . If we envisage to inﬂate this mother vesicle to retract the selected tube without changing the remaining tubes , we obtain a spherical vesicle with radius ˆ R 0 = [ ˆ A 0 / ( 4 π ) ] 1 / 2 and volume ˆ V 0 = 4 π 3 ˆ R 30 . Now , we have to replace the quantities R 0 , V 0 , and A 0 in Eqs . S1 - S3 by ˆ R 0 , ˆ V 0 , and ˆ A 0 and to repeat the whole calculation with the hatted variables . In this way , we study the growth of the selected tube while all the other tubes remain unchanged . As a result , we obtain the critical length ˆ L ∗ tu ≈ 3 ˆ R 0 for the selected tube . Because the redeﬁned vesicle radius ˆ R 0 is smaller than R 0 , the critical length ˆ L ∗ tu is smaller than L ∗ tu for a vesicle with a single tube . This diﬀerence can , however , be neglected for the VM - A and VM - B morphologies studied here . Indeed , after the ﬁrst two deﬂation steps , the total area of all membrane tubes , A = A s + (cid:21) r A r , satisﬁes A ≤ 0 . 1 A 0 , see Fig . 3a in the main text , which implies that ˆ A 0 > 0 . 9 A 0 and ˆ R 0 > 0 . 948 R 0 5 57 irrespective of which individual tube we select . Therefore , the critical tube length ˆ L ∗ tu of any selected tube lies within the interval 2 . 84 R 0 < ˆ L ∗ tu ≤ 3 R 0 and is always much larger than the individual tube lengths observed for the VM - A and VM - B morphologies . When a necklace - like tube with length L ∗ tu is transformed into a cylindrical tube of equal area A ∗ tu , the tube length becomes twice as large . Therefore , in equilibrium , necklace - like tubes should have a length up to L ∗ tu whereas cylindrical tubes should have a length exceeding 2 L ∗ tu . As a consequence , the length distribution of the tubes is predicted to exhibit a gap deﬁned by the interval L ∗ tu < L tu < 2 L ∗ tu . S2 Critical tube length for VM - C morphologies For the VM - C morphologies , the vesicle membrane is partially wetted by the two aqueous phases and the pe membrane segment separating the PEG - rich from the external phase forms the intrinsic contact angle θ in with the pd interface . For the lipid - polymer systems studied here , all intrinsic contact angles were smaller than 90 ◦ ( Fig . 8c in the main text ) . Because of partial wetting , a membrane tube can lower its free energy by adhering to the pd interface . Furthermore , the large separation of length scales between the weakly curved pd interfaces and the strongly curved membrane tubes implies that we can ignore the interfacial curvature and consider the adhesion of the tubes to planar interfaces . In order to obtain explicit expressions for the corresponding adhesion free energies , we also ignore possible deformations of the tube shapes by the adhesion . S2 . 1 Adhesion free energy of necklace - like tube First , consider a necklace - like tube consisting of N spherical beads with radius R ss = 1 / | m | as in Fig . S4a . A single bead will immerse into the dextran - rich phase until the angle between the pd interface and the pe segment of the bead membrane is equal to the intrinsic contact angle θ in . In the following , we will ﬁrst consider an arbitrary contact angle θ and then require that the adhesion free energy attains its lowest value when this contact angle is equal to the intrinsic contact angle θ in . When the tube membrane forms the contact angle θ with the pd interface , the total surface area A nl of the necklace - like tube is partitioned into two segments according to A nl = N 4 πR 2ss = N 4 π | m | − 2 = A mp + A md ( S21 ) with the contact area A mp = N 2 πR 2ss ( 1 + cos θ ) = N 2 π | m | − 2 ( 1 + cos θ ) ( S22 ) 6 58 between the inner leaﬂet of the membrane and the PEG - rich phase and and the contact area A md = N 2 πR 2ss ( 1 − cos θ ) = N 2 π | m | − 2 ( 1 − cos θ ) ( S23 ) between the inner leaﬂet of the membrane and the dextran - rich phase . At the same time , the area A pd of the pd interface is reduced by Δ A pd = N π ( R ss sin θ ) 2 = N π | m | − 2 sin 2 θ ( S24 ) The interfacial free energy of the pd interface and the free , non - adhering necklace fully immersed in the PEG - rich phase has the form F nl , fr = Σ pd A pd + Σ mp A nl ( S25 ) with the interfacial tension Σ mp of the interface between the inner leaﬂet of the membrane and the PEG - rich phase . Likewise , the interfacial free energy of the necklace adhering to the pd interface is given by F nl , ad = Σ pd ( A pd − Δ A pd ) + Σ mp ( A nl − A md ) + Σ md A md ( S26 ) with the interfacial tension Σ md between the inner leaﬂet of the membrane and the dextran - rich phase . The adhesion free energy of the necklace - like tube is then given by F nl ≡ F nl , ad − F nl , fr = ( Σ md − Σ mp ) A md − Σ pd Δ A pd ( S27 ) or F nl = A nl (cid:2) 12 ( Σ md − Σ mp ) ( 1 − cos θ ) − 14 Σ pd sin 2 θ (cid:3) . ( S28 ) We now require that this free energy attains its equilibrium value when the contact angle θ becomes equal to the intrinsic contact angle θ in corresponding to ∂ F nl / ∂θ = 0 for θ = θ in . This requirement leads to Σ md − Σ mp = Σ pd cos θ in ( S29 ) and to the equilibrium value F eqnl = A nl Σ pd g nl ( θ in ) ( S30 ) for the adhesion free energy of the necklace - like tube with the angle - dependent function g nl ( θ ) ≡ 12 cos θ ( 1 − cos θ ) − 14 sin 2 θ = − 14 ( 1 − cos θ ) 2 . ( S31 ) The second expression for g nl ( θ ) implies that the adhesion free energy F eqnl is negative for nonzero values of the intrinsic contact angle θ in , which shows explicitly that the adhering tube is energetically favored compared to the free tube immersed in the PEG - rich phase . Furthermore , the adhesion free energy density F eqnl / A nl as obtained from ( S30 ) depends only on two material parameters , the interfacial tension Σ pd of the pd interface and the intrinsic contact angle θ in , both of which can be determined experimentally , see Fig . 3b and Fig . 8c in the main text . 7 59 S2 . 2 Adhesion free energy of cylindrical tube Next , consider a cylindrical tube with two spherical end caps as in Fig . S4b . The body of the cylinder has length L cy and radius R cy = 1 / ( 2 | m | ) ; the spherical end caps have the same radius as the cylinder . These two membrane segments have the areas A bodcy = 2 πR cy L cy = π | m | L cy and A capcy = 4 πR 2cy = π m 2 . ( S32 ) When the tube membrane forms the contact angle θ with the pd interface , the tube area A cy is partitioned according to A cy = A bodcy + A capcy = A mp + A md ( S33 ) with the contact areas A mp = 2 ( π − θ ) R cy L cy + 2 πR 2cy ( 1 + cos θ ) ( S34 ) and A md = 2 θR cy L cy + 2 πR 2cy ( 1 − cos θ ) . ( S35 ) At the same time , the area A pd of the pd interface is reduced by Δ A pd = 2 R cy L cy sin θ + πR 2cy sin 2 θ . ( S36 ) The interfacial free energies F cy , fr and F cy , ad have the same general form as in ( S25 ) and ( S26 ) . It then follows that the adhesion free energy of the cylindrical tube is given by F cy = A bodcy G bodcy + A capcy G capcy ( S37 ) with the body contribution G bodcy ≡ ( Σ md − Σ mp ) θ π − Σ pd sin θ π ( S38 ) and the cap contribution G capcy ≡ ( Σ md − Σ mp ) 12 ( 1 − cos θ ) − Σ pd 14 sin 2 θ . ( S39 ) The equilibrium value of the contact angle θ is again imposed by the condition ∂F cy / ∂θ = 0 for θ = θ in which leads to the same relation Σ md − Σ mp = Σ pd cos θ in as in ( S29 ) . As a consequence , the adhesion free energy of the capped cylindrical tube has the equilibrium form F eqcy = Σ pd A bodcy g cy ( θ in ) + Σ pd A capcy g nl ( θ in ) ( S40 ) with the function g cy ( θ ) ≡ θ π cos θ − sin θ π ( S41 ) and the function g nl ( θ ) as deﬁned in ( S31 ) . 8 60 S2 . 3 Critical area and critical length of adhering tubes We now compare an adhering necklace - like tube with an adhering cylindrical tube of the same tube area A tu which then satisﬁes A tu = A cy = A nl . ( S42 ) The bending energy of the necklace - like tube vanishes whereas the capped cylin - der has the bending energy 2 πκ arising from the spherical end caps as in ( S12 ) . Therefore , we have to consider the free energy diﬀerence Δ F = F eqcy + 2 πκ − F eqnl ( S43 ) which can be rewritten in the form Δ F = 2 πκ − Σ pd A tu (cid:10) 1 − π m 2 A tu (cid:11) g ( θ in ) ( S44 ) with the function g ( θ ) ≡ g nl ( θ ) − g cy ( θ ) = 1 π ( sin θ − θ cos θ ) − 14 ( 1 − cos θ ) 2 . ( S45 ) As shown in Fig . S4c , the function g ( θ ) is positive for 0 < θ < π . Therefore , the shape of the adhering tube is determined by the competition between the bending energy 2 πκ of the spherical caps , which favors necklace - like tubes , and the adhesion free energy , which favors cylindrical tubes . The spherical cap energy is independent of the tube area whereas the adhesion free energy is proportional to this area . As a consequence , short adhering tubes are necklace - like whereas long adhering tubes are cylindrical . These two regimes are separated by the critical tube area A ∗ tu = 2 πκ Σ pd g ( θ in ) + π m 2 ( S46 ) as follows from Δ F = 0 . The ﬁrst term directly reﬂects the interplay between the membrane’s bending rigidity κ , the interfacial tension Σ pd , and the intrinsic contact angle θ in for partial wetting . The second term on the right hand side of ( S46 ) represents a correction term arising from the spherical end caps . In Fig . S4d , we compare the free energies of single necklace - like and cylindrical tubes as a function of tube area A tu for the Ld 4 and the Lo 4 vesicles . The critical tube area is about 4 . 4 μ m 2 for the Ld 4 vesicle and about 80 . 7 μ m 2 for the Lo 4 vesicle . From an experimental point , it is easier to measure the length of individual tubes rather than their area . The critical length L ∗ ad = N ∗ ad 2 / | m | of the necklace - like tube with the critical bead number N ∗ ad is given by L ∗ ad = A ∗ tu | m | 2 π = κ | m | Σ pd g ( θ in ) + 1 2 | m | . ( S47 ) When a necklace - like tube with length L ∗ ad is transformed into a cylindrical tube of equal area A ∗ tu , the tube length becomes twice as large . Therefore , in equilibrium , 9 61 necklace - like tubes should have a length up to L ∗ ad whereas cylindrical tubes should have a length exceeding 2 L ∗ ad . For the example displayed in Fig . S4d corresponding to the fourth deﬂation step , the critical tube length L ∗ ad is 5 . 6 μ m for the Ld 4 vesicle and 21 . 4 μ m for the Lo 4 vesicle . S3 Tube ﬂexibility and persistence length The ﬂexibility of membrane nanotubes can be characterized by the persistence length for tube bending . This length scale governs the exponential decay of the two - point correlation function between unit tangent vectors along the tube , in close analogy to semiﬂexible polymers [ 4 , 5 ] . A cylindrical tube of radius R cy has the persistence length [ 6 , 7 ] ξ p = 2 πκR cy / ( k B T ) . ( S48 ) For R cy = 1 / ( 2 | m | ) corresponding to the state of lowest bending energy , this expres - sion becomes ξ p = πκ | m | k B T . ( S49 ) Using the overall partitioning of the membrane area with total tube area A and total tube length L , a cylindrical tube has the spontaneous curvature | m | = πL / A which implies the persistence length ξ p = κ k B T A L ( cylindrical tube ) . ( S50 ) The persistence length of the necklace - like tube , on the other hand , is comparable to the diameter 2 R ss = 2 / | m | of the small spheres which implies ξ p (cid:8) 2 R ss = 1 π A L ( necklace - like tube ) . ( S51 ) For the Ld membrane studied here , the bending rigidity κ Ld = 0 . 82 × 10 − 19 J and κ Ld / ( k B T ) = 20 at room temperature ( 25 ◦ C ) . For the Ld 1 vesicle , we obtained the total tube area A = 473 μ m 2 and the total tube length L = 600 μ m . If the tubes were cylindrical , we would obtain the spontaneous curvature | m | = 1 / ( 0 . 251 μ m ) and the persistence length ξ p = 15 . 4 μ m . If the tubes were necklace - like , we would obtain the spontaneous curvature | m | = 1 / ( 0 . 125 μ m ) and the persistence length ξ p (cid:8) 0 . 25 μ m . Inspection of the Movies Ld 1 and Ld 2 reveals that the thermal ﬂuctuations of the tubes lead to hairpin - like conformations with curvature radii of the order of 2 μ m which implies a persistence length below 2 μ m . Such an upper bound for the persistence length is consistent with a necklace - like but not with a cylindrical tube morphology . 10 62 Figure S1 : Shapes of aqueous droplets for diﬀerent vesicle morphologies : The images correspond to Ld j vesicles after the j th deﬂation step with j = 0 , 2 , 3 , and 4 as observed by diﬀerential interference contrast ( DIC ) microscopy ( top row ) and ﬂuorescence microscopy ( bottom row ) . The two images with the same j - value display the same vesicle . The white scale bar is 10 μ m in all panels . The images were obtained by a horizontally aligned inverted microscope ( Axiovert 135 , Zeiss ) equipped with a 40x long distance objective and a mono - color camera .

The latter line divides the membrane up into two segments , the pe segment between the PEG - rich droplet and the exterior phase as well as the de segment between the dextran - rich droplet and the exterior phase . When viewed with optical resolution , the membrane exhibits a kink at the contact line which deﬁnes the eﬀective contact angles θ p , θ d , and θ e ; ( b ) The three arrows represent the interfacial tension Σ pd as well as the two membrane tensions ˆΣ pe and ˆΣ de within the pe and de segments of the membrane .

The necklace - like tube corresponds to the ratio R ne / R bu = 0 , the cylindrical tube to R ne / R bu = 1 ; ( b ) For given membrane area A and tube length L , the mean curvature M increases monotonically from M = − 2 πL / A for the necklace - like tube to M = − πL / A for the cylindrical tube ; and ( c ) Three examples of unduloids for ﬁxed A and L that interpolate between the necklace - like and the cylindrical tube with mean curvature M in units of πL / A ( right column ) . As we transform the sphere - necklace into the cylinder , the neck radius R ne of the intermediate unduloid increases monotonically whereas the bulge radius R bu ﬁrst increases and then decreases again . The latter radius has the value A / ( 2 πL ) both for the cylindrical tube and for the sphere - necklace and attains its maximum at M = m = − 1 . 187 πL / A with max ( R bu ) = 0 . 662 A / πL . 14 66 Table S1 : Deﬂation path within the phase diagram of Fig . 2 : The deﬂation path in Fig . 2a , b consists of seven deﬂation steps which lead to seven compositions of the aqueous polymer solution within the vesicle , labeled from j = 1 to j = 7 .

The columns 2 - 7 display the following quantities : Dextran weight fraction w d , PEG weight fraction w p , total polymer mass density c j of the interior solution , as well as concentration ratio c j / c 0 , osmolarity ratio P e / P 0 between the exterior and the initial osmolarities , P e and P 0 . The exterior osmolarity P e is increased by exchanging the external medium by a hypertonic solution with constant w d = w p = 0 . 0327 and an increasing weight fraction of sucrose . For j ≥ 0 , the weight frac - tions w d and w p represent the weight fractions of all dextran and all PEG molecules within the interior solution , irrespective of whether this solution is uniform or phase separated , and are characterized by the constant ratio w d / w p = 1 . 25 .

This concentration determines the reduced polymer concentration (cid:15) = | c cr − c | / c cr which measures the distance from the critical consolute point with concentration c cr . For the PEG and dextran chains studied here , the radii of gyration have been estimated to be R p = 4 . 05 nm and R d = 21 nm . [ 9 ] The overlap concentrations of PEG and dextran are then given by 1 / [ ( 4 π / 3 ) R 3p ] = 0 . 00359 / nm 3 and 1 / [ ( 4 π / 3 ) R 3d ] = 0 . 0258 / ( 10 nm ) 3 which are equivalent to the overlap weight fractions w ∗ p = 0 . 0477 and w ∗ d = 0 . 0193 . We characterize the degree of overlapping and the associated strength of repulsive chain - chain interactions by the overlap ratios w p / w ∗ p and w d / w ∗ d . Columns 4 and 5 display the overlap ratios of the PEG and dextran chains within the one - phase region . In this region , the large dextran chains overlapped already at the lowest dextran concentration while the smaller PEG chains did not overlap with each other but always overlapped with the dextran chains . The corresponding ratios after phase separation are shown in columns 6 and 7 for the PEG - rich phase as well as in columns 8 and 9 for the dextran - rich phase . In the PEG - rich phase , the overlap of the PEG chains increased with each deﬂation step whereas the dextran chains became separated after the third step . In the dextran - rich phase , the dextran chains overlapped more and more strongly whereas the PEG chains became more and more dilute but had to overlap with the dextran chains . Thus , all polymer solutions along the deﬂation path were semi - dilute . comp . c j (cid:15) w p w ∗ p w d w ∗ d w PEp w ∗ p w PEd w ∗ d w DEp w ∗ p w DEd w ∗ d j [ g / cm 3 ] 0e 0 . 0664 0 . 69 1 . 69 0 0 . 0714 0 . 139 0 . 65 2 . 02 1 0 . 0800 0 . 035 0 . 73 2 . 26 cr 0 . 0829 0 0 . 76 2 . 34 2 0 . 0838 0 . 011 0 . 94 1 . 36 0 . 57 3 . 53 3 0 . 0875 0 . 055 1 . 09 0 . 79 0 . 46 4 . 42 4 0 . 0909 0 . 097 1 . 18 0 . 56 0 . 39 5 . 03 7 0 . 1002 0 . 209 1 . 38 0 . 25 0 . 28 6 . 78 17 69 Movie Ld 1 : Morphology VM - A of Ld membrane Giant vesicle bounded by an Ld membrane ( red ) after the ﬁrst deﬂation step .

The bilayer asymmetry is described quantitatively by the spontaneous curvature of the membrane . First , we study the engulfment of particles by model vesicles using numerical energy mini - mization , as described in Section 1 . 6 of this thesis . We describe for the ﬁrst time the eﬀects of vesicle size on engulfment , and show that even small spontaneous curvatures strongly aﬀect the engulfment behavior . We show that , depending on the values of particle size , vesicle size , adhesive strength and spontaneous curvature , there are four distinct engulfment regimes , with the particle being either free , partially engulfed , completely engulfed , or displaying bistability between the free and completely engulfed states . We then go on to show that these four engulfment regimes are determined by the instabilities of the free and completely engulfed states , for which we obtain analytical expressions . The instability condition of the free particle state generalizes the condition for vesicle adhesion to planar substrates , see eq ( 1 . 18 ) in Section 1 . 3 . 3 . 3 of this thesis ; whereas the instability condition of the completely engulfed state generalizes the ideal neck condition previously known for the budding of homogeneous vesicles , see eq ( 1 . 14 ) in Section 1 . 3 . 3 . 1 . The two stability conditions are then used to show that the engulfment of particles by planar or quasi - planar membranes is strongly aﬀected by spontaneous curvature . They also provide a way to measure the spontaneous curvature and particle – membrane adhesive strength from image analysis of experiments or simulations . Finally , we consider particle - induced segregation of membrane components , leading to a bound membrane segment with diﬀerent bending rigidity and spontaneous curvature than the unbound segment . We model the case of clathrin - mediated endocytosis in cells by considering bound segments with a large negative spontaneous curvature compared to the unbound segment . We show that the non - monotonic dependence of particle uptake by cells observed in experiments , as introduced in Section 1 . 5 . 3 of this thesis , can be explained 73 3 Critical Particle Sizes for the Engulfment of Nanoparticles by Membranes and Vesicles with Bilayer Asymmetry as a consequence of the strongly asymmetric clathrin coat . Our analytical expression for the particle uptake provides a ﬁt to existing experimental results on clathrin - mediated endocytosis of gold nanoparticles by HeLa cells . The paper thus expands the existing literature on engulfment by model membranes as well as by biological cells ( see Section 1 . 5 of this thesis ) in a new direction , showing that bilayer asymmetry ( in the form of spontaneous curvature ) plays a key role in particle engulfment and should not be neglected . The analytical expressions for the instability of the free and completely engulfed states allows one to understand and predict particle engulfment without the need to perform numerical calculations . 74 A GU DO - CA N A LEJ O A N D LIP O W S KY V O L . 9 ’ N O . 4 ’ 370 4 – 3720 ’ 20 1 5 www . acsnano . org 3704 April 03 , 2015 C 20 1 5AmericanChemica l Societ y Critical Particle Sizes for the Engulfment of Nanoparticles by Membranes and Vesicles with Bilayer Asymmetry Jaime Agudo - Canalejo and Reinhard Lipowsky * Theory & Biosystems , Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces , 14424 Potsdam , Germany T he interaction o f nano p artic l es with bio l ogica l an d biomimetic mem - branes pl a y s an im p ortant ro l e in man y d i ﬀ erent p rocesses s u ch as biome d i - ca l imaging , d r u g d e l i v er y , nanoto x icit y , an d v ira l in f ection . 1 (cid:2) 4 T wo im p ortant ste p s o f these p rocesses are the a d hesion o f the p artic l es to the membranes an d their s u b - se qu ent eng ulf ment b y these membranes , both ste p s being go v erne d b y the inter pl a y o f p artic l e a d hesion an d membrane ben d - ing . 5 B iomimetic mo d e l s y stems consisting o f nano p artic l es in contact with l i p i d 6 (cid:2) 1 0 or p o ly mer 11 v esic l es ha v e been u se d to e lu ci - d ate the p artic l e a d hesion an d eng ulf ment p rocess e xp erimenta lly .

Many studies have shown that both surface chemistry , which determines the adhesive strength of the membrane (cid:2) particle interactions , and particle size represent key parameters for these processes . Here , we show that the asymmetry between the two lea ﬂ ets of a bilayer membrane provides another key parameter for the engulfment of nanoparticles . The asymmetric membrane prefers to curve in a certain manner as quantitatively described by its spontaneous curvature . We derive two general relationships between particle size , adhesive strength , and spontaneous curvature that determine the instabilities of ( i ) the nonadhering or free state and ( ii ) the completely engulfedstateoftheparticle . Formodelmembranessuchaslipidorpolymerbilayerswith auniformcomposition , thetworelationshipsleadtotwocritical particle sizes that determine four distinct engulfment regimes , both for the endocytic and for the exocytic engulfment process . For strong adhesion , the criticalparticlesizesareontheorderof10nm , whiletheyareontheorderof1000nmforweakorultraweakadhesion . Ourtheoreticalresultsaretherefore accessible to both experimental studies and computer simulations of model membranes . In order to address the more complex process of receptor - mediated endocytosis , we take the adhesion - induced segregation of membrane components into account and consider bound and unbound membrane segments that di ﬀ er in their spontaneous curvatures . To model protein coats as formed during clathrin - dependent endocytosis , we focus on the case in which the bound membrane segments have a large spontaneous curvature compared to the unbound ones . We derive explicit expressions for the engulfment rate and the uptake of nanoparticles , which both depend on the particle size in a nonmonotonic manner , and provide a quantitative ﬁ t to experimental data for clathrin - dependent endocytosis of gold nanoparticles .

Thecompletelyengulfedstateisunstableiftheopening of the neck leads to a decrease in the membrane ' s bend - ing energy that overcompensates the loss in adhe - sion energy . The corresponding instability criterion as described by eq 8 involves the mean curvature M ms 0 of the weakly curved membrane segment ( dotted line ) of the mother vesicle . For a convex segment as shown here , the segment curvature M ms 0 is positive . In general , this curvature must be smaller than 1 / R pa to ensure that the unbound and bound membrane segments do not intersect each other . TABLE 3 .

Free Energy Landscapes for Engulfment Process Geometry of bound and unbound membrane segments . In order to minimize the free energy of the vesicle - particle system , we decomposed the membrane into a bound seg - ∗ To whom correspondence should be addressed 1 92 ment and an unbound segment as shown in Figure S1 for endocytic engulfment . The bound membrane segment ( red in Figure S1 ) is in contact with the nanoparticle of radius R pa and extends up to the contact line which deﬁnes the wrapping angle φ . This angle varies from φ = 0 for the free particle state to φ = π for the completely engulfed state and can be regarded as the reaction coordinate for the engulfment process . The total membrane area A = 4 πR 2ve is equal to the sum of the area A bo of the bound membrane segment and the area A un of the unbound segment . The bound segment of the vesicle membrane follows the contour of the particle , and thus assumes the shape of a spherical cap with mean curvature M = ∓ 1 / R pa where the minus and plus sign corresponds to the endocytic and exocytic process , respectively ( main text , Figure 2 ) . The area of the bound segment is given by A bo = 2 πR 2pa ( 1 − cos φ ) . ( S1 ) If we cut the spherical particle along the contact line , we obtain two spherical caps . The spherical cap adjacent to the bound membrane segment has the volume V bo = 4 π 3 R 3pa ( 2 + cos φ ) [ sin ( φ / 2 ) ] 4 . ( S2 ) The unbound membrane segment does not experience molecular interactions with the particle and its shape is determined ( i ) by the location of the contact line , which provides the circular boundary of the unbound membrane segment , ( ii ) by the area A un = A − A bo of the unbound segment , ( iii ) by the eﬀective volume V ± V bo , which is enclosed by the unbound membrane segment and the additional planar surface that spans the circular contact line , where the plus and minus sign applies to endo - and exocytosis , respectively ; and ( iv ) by the spontaneous curvature m . 2 93 94 of the unbound membrane segment where the integral extends over the area A un = A − A bo of the latter segment . In eq S4 , we used the convention that the upper and lower sign of the ± symbol corre - sponds to the endocytic and exocytic case , respectively . The same convention will be used below in all equations in which a ± symbol appears . Free energy minimization . In order to ﬁnd the shape of the unbound segment that minimizes E un for a given value of the wrapping angle φ and , thus , for a given location of the contact line , we minimize the shape functional F un ≡ E un + Σ ( A − A bo ) − Δ P ( V ± V bo ) ( S6 ) where Σ and Δ P are Lagrange multipliers which ensure that the membrane area has the prescribed value A and that the unbound and bound membrane together enclose the vesicle volume V . The auxiliary volume V ± V bo is enclosed by the unbound membrane segment and the additional planar surface that spans the circular contact line . When we calculate the free energy E un ( φ ) of the unbound membrane segment by minimizing the shape functional F un in eq S6 for many diﬀerent values of φ within the interval 0 < φ < π , keeping both the area A and the volume V ﬁxed , we obtain the corresponding free energy landscape E ( φ ) = (cid:2) − 2 π | W | R 2pa + 4 πκ ( 1 ± mR pa ) 2 (cid:3) [ 1 − cos ( φ ) ] + E un ( φ ) ( S7 ) where the ﬁrst term on the right hand side follows from eq S4 . Typical free energy landscapes E ( φ ) obtained in this way are displayed in Figure S2 corresponding to the parameter values marked with green diamonds in Figure 3c . In general , the free energy landscapes may contain additional minima corresponding to additional intermediate states . For the uniform membranes considered in the main text , these additional states can always be ignored because they represent satellite minima very close to the free or completely engulfed states , from 4 95 96 segments , as in eqs S3 - S5 , we obtain E (cid:2)(cid:2) = E (cid:2)(cid:2) bo + E (cid:2)(cid:2) un with E (cid:2)(cid:2) bo = − 2 πR 2pa | W | + 4 πκ ( 1 ± R pa m ) 2 ( S9 ) with the plus ( minus ) sign corresponding to endocytosis ( exocytosis ) . The instability line L fr is now determined by E (cid:2)(cid:2) = − 2 πR 2pa | W | + 4 πκ ( 1 ± R pa m ) 2 + E (cid:2)(cid:2) un = 0 . ( S10 ) Alternatively , we may also determine L fr from the instability relation M co = M ms or (cid:22) R 2pa | W | / ( 2 κ ) = 1 ± R pa M ms ( S11 ) where the expression for the contact mean curvature M co in eq 23 of the main text has been used . The two relationships as given by eqs S10 and S11 are only equivalent if the unbound membrane segment makes the contribution E (cid:2)(cid:2) un = 4 πκR pa [ M ms − m ] [ ± 2 + R pa ( M ms + m ) ] ( S12 ) to the second derivative E (cid:2)(cid:2) . A combination of E (cid:2)(cid:2) bo in eq S9 and E (cid:2)(cid:2) un in eq S12 then leads to E (cid:2)(cid:2) = E (cid:2)(cid:2) bo + E (cid:2)(cid:2) un = − 2 πR 2pa | W | + 4 πκ ( 1 ± R pa M ms ) 2 . ( S13 ) For endocytosis ( + sign ) , this relationship is identical to eq 6 in the main text . Relation between membrane area and mechanical membrane tension . In the the - oretical approach used here , the mechanical tension Σ does not represent an independent parameter but plays the role of a Lagrange multiplier Σ , see eq S6 , which is determined in terms of the other parameters in order to ensure that the membrane area has the prescribed 6 97 value A . 1 – 3 The minimization procedure typically leads to Lagrange multipliers Σ that cor - respond to relatively small tensions of the order of κ / R 2ve , κm / R ve , or κm 2 . If we stretched the membrane with such a tension , the change in membrane area arising from the mem - brane’s area compressibility would be rather small which provides a consistency check on the theory . In fact , even in the presence of relatively large tensions of the order of 1 mN / m , the membrane area can only change by a few percent without rupturing . Thus , as long as the membrane does not rupture , its area remains constant to a very good approximation . For giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs ) , the membrane area A can be directly measured and it is then possible to corroborate the theory by a systematic comparison of calculated and experimentally observed membrane shapes as has been successfully done for lipid vesicles in the absence of nanoparticles . 4 – 6 An alternative theoretical approach has been used in refs 7 and 8 where the engulfment of nanoparticles was theoretically studied in the presence of a certain prescribed membrane tension Σ (cid:2) . This tension was treated as an independent control parameter and then represents a ‘chemical potential’ for membrane area which would govern the exchange of area with a putative area reservoir , in analogy to a grand - canonical ensemble . This approach is motivated by the view that eukaryotic cells control the tension of their plasma membranes , presumably by regulating the osmotic conditions and by remodelling the cytoskeletal forces acting on the cell membrane , which leads to the so - called cortical tension . Because the mechanisms underlying this tension are complex and poorly understood , it is appealing to reduce this complexity to a single tension parameter . One diﬃculty with this approach is that the measured tension values are quite variable and change during the cell cycle . Indeed , recent experiments provide Σ (cid:2) - values in the range between 0 . 05 and 2 mN / m . 9 , 10 Another diﬃculty is that the actin - myosin cortex exerts complex patterns of forces onto the cell membrane which contribute to the membrane tension but , at the same time , directly aﬀect the membrane shape , and it is not obvious that these two eﬀects of the cortical forces may be decomposed and considered separately . 7 98 The lipid membranes and vesicles addressed in our study do not involve an area ( or lipid ) reservoir which implies that the membrane area A rather than the membrane tension should be regarded as the basic control parameter . Furthermore , the instability relations for the free and completely engulfed particle states as derived here depend only on local properties of the membrane close to the nanoparticle and can , thus , also be applied to cell membranes . In fact , one can show that the free energy landscapes for particle engulfment remain unaﬀected by small tensions Σ (cid:2) (cid:5) Σ o ≡ κ / R 2pa . For a membrane with a clathrin coat , the bending rigidity is κ = 10 − 18 J as measured in ref 11 which leads to crossover tensions Σ o ≥ 0 . 4 mN / m for particle sizes R pa ≤ 50 nm as studied experimentally in refs 12 and 13 . B . Exocytic Engulfment of Nanoparticles Instability relations for exocytic engulfment . For exocytic engulfment , the curvature M ms of the membrane segment adjacent to the free particle state F ( main text , Figure 5 ) must be smaller than 1 / R pa in order to ensure that the membrane and the particle do not intersect each other . Furthermore , the contact mean curvature is given by M co = − 1 R W + 1 R pa as explained in the Methods section . As a consequence , the relation M co = M ms for the instability line L fr of the free state F leads to R pa = R fr ≡ 1 M ms + R − 1 W and M ms > − 1 / R W ( L fr , exocytosis ) . ( S14 ) and the membrane segment starts to spread over the particle if R pa > R fr and M ms > − 1 / R W ( unstable F , exocytosis ) . ( S15 ) For strongly curved membrane segments with a negative mean curvature M ms smaller than − 1 / R W , the free state F is stable for all particle sizes , i . e . , the critical particle size R fr = ∞ . For exocytic engulfment , the curvature M (cid:2) ms of the mother membrane adjacent to the 8 99 membrane neck of the completely engulfed state C ( main text , Figure 6 ) must be larger than − 1 / R pa in order to ensure that the mother membrane does not intersect the membrane segment bound to the particle . The instability line L ce for the state C as determined by M co + M (cid:2) ms = 2 m now has the form R pa = R ce ≡ 1 2 m + R − 1 W − M (cid:2) ms for M (cid:2) ms < 2 m + 1 / R W ( L ce , exocytosis ) , ( S16 ) and the membrane neck starts to open if R pa < R ce and M (cid:2) ms < 2 m + 1 / R W ( unstable C , exocytosis ) . ( S17 ) If the unbound membrane segment has a mean curvature M (cid:2) ms larger than 2 m + 1 R W , the completely engulfed state C is unstable for all particle sizes , i . e . , R ce = ∞ . The physical re - quirement that the membrane has no self - intersections in state C leads to the additional con - dition that M (cid:2) ms is larger than − 1 / R pa . Therefore , stable states C without self - intersections are only possible for − 1 R pa < M (cid:2) ms < 2 m + 1 R W . These instability lines and instability criteria for exocytic engulfment can be transformed into those for endocytic engulfment , if we change ( i ) the sign of the spontaneous curvature m as well as ( ii ) the signs of the curvatures M ms and M (cid:2) ms of the two membrane segments . This ‘mirror symmetry’ implies that we have a one - to - one correspondence between the engulfment diagrams for exocytic and endocytic engulfment as illustrated further below for the case of weakly curved membranes . For notational simplicity , we have used the same notation R W for the adhesion length of both the endocytic and the exocytic process . Note , however , that the two adhesion lengths may have diﬀerent numerical values because the molecular interactions described by the adhesive strength W may be diﬀerent on the two sides of the asymmetric bilayer . 9 100 101 Table S1 : Critical particle sizes for exocytic engulfment as derived from eqs S15 and S17 . Range of spontaneous Intermediate Engulfment Lower Upper curvature m size regime process critical size critical size m > 12 ( M ms + M (cid:2) ms ) bistable B st discontinuous R ce R fr m < 12 ( M ms + M (cid:2) ms ) partial P st continuous R fr R ce R W . Inspection of Figure S3b shows that exocytic engulfment by ﬂat membranes leads to partially engulfed states for negative spontaneous curvature and to bistability for positive spontaneous curvature . This behavior for the exocytic process is exactly the opposite of the behavior for the endocytic process for which partially engulfed states occur for positive spontaneous curvature and bistability is found for negative spontaneous curvatures ( main text , Figure 7b ) . For small but ﬁnite values of the segment curvatures M ms and M (cid:2) ms , the regimes for exocytic engulfment again undergo small changes , primarily determined by the sign of M ms + M (cid:2) ms , as illustrated in Figure S3a and Figure S3c . A detailed comparison of the diﬀerent regimes for exocytic and endocytic engulfment as displayed in Figure S3 and Figure 7 shows that the exocytic diagrams can be obtained from the endocytic ones if we simultaneously change the sign of the spontaneous curvature m as well as the signs of the segment curvatures M ms and M (cid:2) ms . In this way , we obtain Figure S3c from Figure 7a and Figure S3a from Figure 7c . This ‘mirror symmetry’ of the engulfment diagrams is a direct consequence of the corresponding ‘mirror symmetry’ of the instability criteria as pointed out after eq S17 . Adhesion length and spontaneous curvature from critical particle sizes . If the exocytic engulfment process is continuous and proceeds via partially engulfed states , the two critical particle sizes R fr and R ce > R fr are accessible to direct observation , either in experimental or in simulations studies . From the observed critical sizes , we can then 11 102 determine the adhesion length via R W = R fr 1 − R fr M ms ( cont exocytosis ) ( S18 ) and the spontaneous curvature via m = 12 (cid:10) 1 R ce − 1 R fr + M ms + M (cid:2) ms (cid:11) ( cont exocytosis ) ( S19 ) as follows from eqs S14 and S16 . C . Kinetics of Membrane Spreading and Engulfment Rate Force balance at the contact line . The spreading of the membrane over the particle surface is induced by the attractive membrane - particle forces and proceeds via the displace - ment of the contact line . For the engulfment of a spherical particle , the membrane geometry is axially symmetric and the contact line has the total length L co = 2 πR pa sin ( φ ) . ( S20 ) The position of the contact line is determined by the contact point of the membrane contour . The coordinate of this point is taken to be the arc length s ≡ R pa φ ( S21 ) of the bound membrane contour measured from the south pole of the particle with φ = 0 as in Figure S1 . The displacement of the contact line now corresponds to changes in s . The contact line at position s experiences two forces : a thermodynamic driving force and a friction force . The thermodynamic driving force F 1 reﬂects the change in the system’s 12 103 energy as we displace the contact line . This force has the form F 1 = − d E s ( s ) d s = − 1 R pa d E ( φ ) d φ ( S22 ) where E s ( s ) is the free energy landscape of the system as a function of s , i . e . , E s ( s ) = E ( φ ( s ) ) = E ( s / R pa ) with the free energy landscape E ( φ ) as discussed before , see Figure S2 . The force F 2 , on the other hand , depends on the dissipation mechanism . If the contact line does not move , there will be no friction . Therefore , the friction force F 2 is taken to be proportional to the velocity v = d s / d t of the contact line which is equal to the derivative of arc length s with respect to time t . The friction coeﬃcient for the displacement of the whole contact line should be proportional to the length L co of the contact line which implies F 2 = η eﬀ L co d s / d t which deﬁnes the eﬀective dynamic viscosity η eﬀ . Using eq S20 for the contact length L co and changing variables from arc length s to wrapping angle φ via s = R pa φ , we obtain the φ - dependent friction force F 2 = 2 π η eﬀ R 2pa sin ( φ ) d φ d t . ( S23 ) We now balance the thermodynamic driving force F 1 in eq S22 with the friction force F 2 in eq S23 , i . e . , we set F 1 = F 2 which leads to the equation of motion for the contact line as given by sin ( φ ) d φ d t = − 1 2 π η eﬀ R 3pa d E ( φ ) d φ ( S24 ) which is identical with eq 17 in the main text . Size - dependent engulfment rate . The equation of motion for the contact line ( eq S24 ) involves the gradient d E / d φ of the free energy landscape which can again be decomposed into two contributions from the bound and unbound membrane segment , i . e . , d E ( φ ) d φ = d E bo ( φ ) d φ + d E un ( φ ) d φ ( S25 ) 13 104 with d E bo ( φ ) d φ = (cid:2) − 2 π | W | R 2pa + 4 πκ bo ( 1 ± m bo R pa ) 2 (cid:3) sin ( φ ) ( S26 ) with the plus sign corresponding to endocytosis . As far as the gradient d E un ( φ ) / d φ of the unbound membrane ( or mother membrane ) is concerned , it is intuitively plausible that E un ( φ ) changes primarily by shape changes of the unbound membrane segment close to the contact line and that these changes are small if this segment can adapt its mean curvature to the spontaneous curvature m . For m = 0 , for example , this segment can attain a shape close to a catenoid which has vanishing bending energy and , thus , makes no contribution to E un . This expectation can be directly conﬁrmed for the initial spreading close to the free state F , i . e . , for small values of the wrapping angle φ because d E un ( φ ) d φ ≈ E (cid:2)(cid:2) un , fr φ = 4 πκR pa [ M ms − m ] [ ± 2 + R pa ( M ms + m ) ] φ for small φ ( S27 ) as follows from E un ( φ ) ≈ E un ( 0 ) + 12 E (cid:2)(cid:2) un , fr φ 2 and eq S12 with E (cid:2)(cid:2) un = E (cid:2)(cid:2) un , fr . The latter equation also applies to the present case because the unbound membrane segment ( or mother membrane ) is characterized by the same ﬂuid - elastic parameters m and κ as in the case of the uniform membrane . Likewise , for the ﬁnal spreading process close to the completely engulfed state C , i . e . , for small deviations δφ ≡ φ − π , the free energy landscape for the unbound membrane segment behaves as E un ( φ ) ≈ E un ( π ) + 12 E (cid:2)(cid:2) un , ce δφ 2 with E (cid:2)(cid:2) un , ce ≡ d 2 E un ( φ ) d φ 2 (cid:23)(cid:23)(cid:23)(cid:23)(cid:23) φ = π = 4 πκR pa [ M (cid:2) ms − m ] [ ± 2 + R pa ( 3 m − M (cid:2) ms ) ] . ( S28 ) which implies the gradient d E un ( φ ) d φ ≈ 4 πκR pa ( M (cid:2) ms − m ) [ ± 2 + R pa ( 3 m − M (cid:2) ms ) ] δφ for small δφ . ( S29 ) 14 105 Inspection of eqs S27 and S29 shows that the gradient d E un ( φ ) / d φ is proportional to R pa ( M ms − m ) for small φ and to R pa ( M (cid:2) ms − m ) for small δφ = φ − π . These dependencies have two implications . First , the gradient d E un ( φ ) / d φ vanishes for small φ and M ms = m as well as for small δφ and M (cid:2) ms = m as expected . Second , this gradient becomes small if both the segment curvatures M ms and M (cid:2) ms as well as the spontaneous curvature m are small compared to the inverse particle radius 1 / R pa . The latter property motivates a systematic expansion of the free energy E un in powers of the size ratio (cid:7) ≡ R pa / R ve with R ve = (cid:4) A / 4 π as before . Such an expansion shows ( i ) that M (cid:2) ms ≈ M ms to leading order in (cid:7) and ( ii ) that the free energy gradient d E un / d φ of the unbound membrane segment behaves as d E un ( φ ) d φ = ± 8 πκ R pa ( M ms − m ) sin ( φ ) cos ( φ ) + O ( (cid:7) 2 ) . ( S30 ) For small values of φ and δφ = φ − π , this expression becomes identical , to ﬁrst order in (cid:7) = R pa / R ve , with eq S27 and eq S29 , respectively . This asymptotic behavior has been conﬁrmed by numerical minimization of the total free energy . Therefore , in the limit of small size ratios R pa / R ve , the gradient d E un ( φ ) / d φ is proportional to R pa ( M ms − m ) ≈ R pa ( M (cid:2) ms − m ) for all values of φ . As a consequence , this gradient can be neglected if both the segment curvatures M ms and M (cid:2) ms as well as the spontaneous curvature m are much smaller than the inverse particle radius 1 / R pa . In the latter case , the gradient of the free energy landscape is determined by the bound membrane segment alone and behaves as d E ( φ ) d φ ≈ d E bo ( φ ) d φ = (cid:2) − 2 π | W | R 2pa + 4 πκ bo ( 1 ± m bo R pa ) 2 (cid:3) sin ( φ ) ( S31 ) as follows from eq S26 . When we insert this expression for d E ( φ ) / d φ into the equation of motion as given by eq S24 ( or eq 17 in the main text ) , the factors proportional to sin ( φ ) cancel and we obtain the simpliﬁed equation of motion d φ d t = | W | R 2pa − 2 κ ( 1 ± mR pa ) 2 η eﬀ R 3pa ( S32 ) 15 106 which implies that the wrapping velocity d φ / d t is constant and that the engulfment time t FC follows from π = | W | R 2pa − 2 κ ( 1 ± mR pa ) 2 η eﬀ R 3pa t FC . ( S33 ) For the plus sign corresponding to endocytosis , eq S33 is equivalent to eq 18 in the main text . References ( 1 ) Deuling , H . ; Helfrich , W .

By using the analytical expressions obtained before for the instability conditions of the free and completely engulfed states we show that , depending on the local curvature of the vesicle at the point of contact with the particle , a particle will either remain free , be partially or completely engulfed , or show bistability between the free and the completely engulfed states . The four engulfment regimes that we had described previously can therefore coexist on the surface of a single vesicle , forming diﬀerent engulfment patterns . For a homogeneous vesicle , we show that up to three diﬀerent engulfment regimes can be simultaneously present on a single vesicle , combining to form a total of ten possible engulfment patterns . These patterns depend strongly on the vesicle shape , as deﬁned by its reduced volume ; on the spontaneous curvature ; and on the particle size and adhesiveness , which are both encoded into a single parameter , the contact mean curvature . We obtain exact morphology diagrams showing the regions of stability of the diﬀerent engulfment patterns , as well as the transitions between them . This paper thus provides for the ﬁrst time a way to predict engulfment behavior at non - axisymmetric locations of vesicles , expanding the literature on particle engulfment in yet another new direction . This is achieved without the need of carrying out numerical calculations , thanks to the instability conditions obtained before . The importance of bilayer asymmetry to the engulfment process is highlighted once again , and novel engulfment patterns that should be observable in experiment are predicted . 109 Adhesive Nanoparticles as Local Probes of Membrane Curvature Jaime Agudo - Canalejo and Reinhard Lipowsky * Theory and Bio - Systems , Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces , 14424 Potsdam , Germany ABSTRACT : Biological and biomimetic membranes display complex shapes with nonuniform curvature . Because the interaction of adhesive nanoparticles with such membranes depends on the local membrane curvature , di ﬀ erent segments of the same membrane can di ﬀ er in their engulfment behavior . For a single vesicle in contact with many nanoparticles , we predict ten distinct engulfment patterns as well as morphological transitions between these patterns , which are directly accessible to experiment . KEYWORDS : membranes and vesicles , nanoparticle − membrane adhesion , nanoparticle engulfment , bilayer asymmetry , local stability analysis , contact mean curvature , spontaneous curvature N anoparticles are widely used to deliver drugs , imaging agents , and toxins to biological cells . 1 , 2 The cellular uptake of a nanoparticle requires the engulfment of this particle by the cell membrane , a process that is dominated by the competition between particle adhesion and membrane bending . 3 The underlying interactions can be studied experimentally in biomimetic systems consisting of nano - particles and lipid 4 − 8 or polymer 9 vesicles . Several theoretical and computational methods have also been used to elucidate the engulfment process . 10 − 18 However , all of these previous studies of nanoparticle − membrane systems have ignored one important aspect of biological and biomimetic membranes , namely their complex , nontrivial shapes . 19 − 22 Cells and cellular organelles display a whole catalogue of shapes , such as the prolate - like shapes of dividing cells or mitochondria ; the discocyte , stomatocyte , and echinocyte shapes of red blood cells ; the invaginated , stomatocyte - like shapes of nascent autophagosomes ; or the recently reported “ parking garage ” shapes of the endoplasmic reticulum . 23 Interestingly , many of these shapes can be mimicked using lipid 19 or polymer vesicles . 24 In particular , prolate , discocyte , and stomatocyte shapes arise naturally as the shapes that minimize the bending energy of closed vesicle membranes with constrained volume 20 and will be used as examples of complex membrane shapes in the following . Our results also apply to vesicle shapes that are topologically distinct from a sphere , corresponding to toroidal or higher genus shapes with one or several handles . 25 , 26 Previous theoretical studies of nanoparticle − membrane systems have been subject to certain limitations . Direct computation of minimal energy shapes of membranes is only possible for axisymmetric geometries , and therefore , previous work has been restricted to the engulfment of spherical particles by planar membranes 10 , 12 or at the poles of closed axisymmetric vesicles . 11 , 13 , 14 The study of nonaxisymmetric geometries is computationally expensive because it requires the numerical energy minimization of triangulated or spline surfaces , 15 , 16 or alternatively molecular dynamics simulations , 17 , 18 and e ﬀ orts have focused mainly on the engulfment of nonspherical particles by planar membranes . In this Letter , we show how the approach introduced in ref 14 , based on local stability analysis of free and completely engulfed particles , can be used to understand the engulfment of spherical particles at nonaxisymmetric locations on the vesicle surface . In this way , we can elucidate the interaction of nanoparticles with membranes of any shape . In general , attractive interactions between a nanoparticle and a membrane can lead to di ﬀ erent states of engulfment . Previous studies have shown that spherical nanoparticles do not bind to membranes for weak attractive interactions but become completely engulfed for su ﬃ ciently strong adhesion . 3 , 10 Recently , we found 14 that concave membrane segments with negative mean curvature stabilize partially engulfed states , in which the membrane covers only a fraction of the particle surface , whereas convex segments with positive mean curvature favor bistability of unbound and completely engulfed particles . We thus identi ﬁ ed four distinct stability regimes for the nanoparticles and the associated membrane segments : free (cid:3) segments do not bind the particles at all ; (cid:2) segments completely engulf the particles , whereas (cid:4) segments engulf them only partially ; ﬁ nally , bistable (cid:1) segments exhibit an energy barrier between free and completely engulfed particles . Each type of membrane segment is stable over a certain range of mean curvatures . As a consequence , the di ﬀ erent types of segments can coexist on a single vesicle , creating engulfment patterns with many nanoparticles when the vesicle is exposed to a solution of such particles ; see Figure 1 . We predict that a single vesicle can exhibit ten distinct engulfment patterns : four single - segment patterns , with the whole vesicle membrane being composed of a single (cid:3) , (cid:4) , (cid:2) , or (cid:1) segment , four two - segment patterns , namely (cid:3) + (cid:1) , (cid:1) + (cid:2) , (cid:3) + (cid:4) , or (cid:4) + (cid:2) , and two three - segment patterns provided by (cid:3) + (cid:1) + (cid:4) or (cid:1) + (cid:4) + (cid:2) . Which pattern is present depends on three parameters : the spontaneous curvature of the membrane , the reduced volume of the vesicle , which controls its overall shape , and the Received : August 28 , 2015 Revised : September 29 , 2015 Published : October 2 , 2015 Letter p ubs . acs . org / N anoLett © 2015 American Chemical Society 7168 DOI : 10 . 1021 / acs . nanolett . 5b03475 Nano Lett . 2015 , 15 , 716 8 − 7173 (cid:6)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:22)(cid:1)(cid:15)(cid:22)(cid:1)(cid:7)(cid:18)(cid:1)(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:11)(cid:18)(cid:1)(cid:7)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:11)(cid:22)(cid:22)(cid:1)(cid:7)(cid:21)(cid:23)(cid:15)(cid:9)(cid:16)(cid:11)(cid:1)(cid:20)(cid:24)(cid:8)(cid:16)(cid:15)(cid:22)(cid:14)(cid:11)(cid:10)(cid:1)(cid:24)(cid:18)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:21)(cid:1)(cid:7)(cid:18)(cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:5)(cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:24)(cid:23)(cid:14)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:3)(cid:14)(cid:19)(cid:15)(cid:9)(cid:11)(cid:1)(cid:4)(cid:15)(cid:9)(cid:11)(cid:18)(cid:22)(cid:11)(cid:27)(cid:1)(cid:25)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:9)(cid:14)(cid:1)(cid:20)(cid:11)(cid:21)(cid:17)(cid:15)(cid:23)(cid:22)(cid:9)(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:26)(cid:15)(cid:18)(cid:13)(cid:1)(cid:7)(cid:18)(cid:10)(cid:1)(cid:21)(cid:11)(cid:10)(cid:15)(cid:22)(cid:23)(cid:21)(cid:15)(cid:8)(cid:24)(cid:23)(cid:15)(cid:19)(cid:18)(cid:1)(cid:19)(cid:12)(cid:1)(cid:23)(cid:14)(cid:11)(cid:1)(cid:7)(cid:21)(cid:23)(cid:15)(cid:9)(cid:16)(cid:11)(cid:1)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:1)(cid:7)(cid:18)(cid:26)(cid:1)(cid:7)(cid:10)(cid:7)(cid:20)(cid:23)(cid:7)(cid:23)(cid:15)(cid:19)(cid:18)(cid:22)(cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:1)(cid:18)(cid:19)(cid:18)(cid:29)(cid:9)(cid:19)(cid:17)(cid:17)(cid:11)(cid:21)(cid:9)(cid:15)(cid:7)(cid:16)(cid:1)(cid:20)(cid:24)(cid:21)(cid:20)(cid:19)(cid:22)(cid:11)(cid:22)(cid:28) 110 contact mean curvature , which encodes the information on the size and adhesiveness of the nanoparticles . All three parameters can be controlled experimentally , and changes in these parameters lead to continuous morphological transitions between the di ﬀ erent patterns . Our Letter is organized as follows . We ﬁ rst focus on endocytic engulfment of particles originating from the exterior aqueous compartment and brie ﬂ y review how the stability of free and completely engulfed particles leads to four stability regimes for a single particle . 14 We then show how , for su ﬃ ciently small nanoparticles , these stability regimes depend on only three parameters that also determine the possible engulfment patterns . Next , we extend our theory to exocytic engulfment of particles originating from the interior aqueous compartment and argue that membrane - mediated interactions between the particles do not a ﬀ ect the engulfment patterns . Finally , we discuss the engulfment patterns in connection to experiments . Engulfment can be understood from the interplay between particle adhesion and membrane bending . According to the spontaneous curvature model , 20 , 27 the bending energy density of the membrane is given by (cid:3) be = 2 κ ( M − m ) 2 , where M is the mean curvature , which typically varies along the vesicle membrane . The relevant material parameters of the membrane are its bending rigidity κ and its spontaneous curvature m . The attractive interaction with the particle is described by the adhesive strength , | W | , which represents the absolute value of the adhesive free energy per unit area . 28 We ﬁ rst focus on endocytic engulfment of rigid spherical particles with radius R pa by a vesicle with total membrane area A and enclosed volume V . These three geometrical parameters , together with the three material parameters κ , m , and | W | , determine the particle − vesicle morphologies . It will be useful to de ﬁ ne the contact mean curvature κ ≡ | | − ⎛ ⎝ ⎜⎜ ⎞ ⎠ ⎟⎟ M R W R 1 2 1 co pa pa2 ( 1 ) which encodes the competition between adhesion and bending into a single length scale , and represents 14 the equilibrium mean curvature of the membrane along the contact line with the adhering particle . It is important to note that the contact mean curvature increases both with increasing particle size and with increasing adhesive strength . Let us consider a small segment of the vesicle membrane with mean curvature M ms . The stability limit L fr of a free particle coming into contact with this segment is given by the relation = M M co ms ( 2 ) between the contact mean curvature M co and the mean curvature M ms of the unperturbed membrane segment . The free state is stable for large segment curvatures with M ms > M co but is unstable for small segment curvatures with M ms < M co . In the completely engulfed state , the particle is fully covered by the membrane but is still connected to the mother vesicle by a narrow membrane neck . In the continuum approach used here , the completely engulfed state represents a limit shape with an ideal neck that is attached to the mother vesicle at a single contact point . If the mean curvature of the mother vesicle at this contact point is denoted by M ms ′ , the stability limit L ce of the completely engulfed particle is given by + ′ = M M m 2 co ms ( 3 ) The completely engulfed state is stable if the mother segment curvature is large and satis ﬁ es M ms ′ > 2 m − M co but unstable if it is small with M ms ′ < 2 m − M co . Equations 2 and 3 were validated in ref 14 via extensive numerical calculations and detailed theoretical considerations . We also found that , in the case of particles much smaller than the vesicle , a partially engulfed state can only be stable if both the free and the completely engulfed state are unstable . The two relations in eqs 2 and 3 then de ﬁ ne the boundaries of four stability regimes for the nanoparticles and the associated membrane segments : ( i ) For M ms > M co and M ms ′ < 2 m − M co , the free state is stable and the completely engulfed state is unstable , which de ﬁ nes a stable (cid:4) segment ; ( ii ) for M ms > M co and M ms ′ > 2 m − M co , both the free and the completely engulfed state are stable and the segment belongs to a bistable (cid:1) segment ; ( iii ) for M ms < M co and M ms ′ > 2 m − M co , the free state is unstable and the completely engulfed state is stable , which implies a stable (cid:2) segment ; and ( iv ) for M ms < M co and M ms ′ < 2 m − M co , both the free and the completely engulfed state are unstable , and the particle should be partially engulfed by the membrane segment , which then belongs to a stable (cid:5) segment . Vesicle membranes divide the aqueous phase into an interior and exterior compartment . When both compartments contain osmotically active agents , the vesicle adapts its volume in such a way that the osmotic pressure in the interior compartment balances the exterior osmotic pressure . The equilibrium shapes of such a vesicle with volume V , membrane area A , and vesicle size π ≡ R A / 4 ve are then determined , in the absence of nanoparticles , by the reduced volume v ≡ 3 V / 4 π R ve3 and the spontaneous curvature m . 20 In general , these equilibrium shapes form several stable branches such as the prolate and oblate branches for 0 . 65 ≲ v < 1 and m = 0 . When a vesicle with area A and volume V completely engulfs N pa nanoparticles , its overall shape is determined by the decreased area A − 4 π R pa2 N pa and the increased volume V + ( 4 π / 3 ) R pa3 N pa . Therefore , the reduced overall volume is increased from v to Figure 1 . Di ﬀ erent engulfment patterns of nanoparticles ( black ) on a prolate vesicle . The spontaneous curvature of the vesicle membrane is positive in ( a ) and negative in ( b ) . The patterns involve four types of membrane segments : free segments with no engulfment ( red ) and bistable segments with activated engulfment and release ( yellowish orange ) as well as segments decorated by partially engulfed ( blue ) and completely engulfed ( green ) particles . A change in particle size or adhesiveness leads to continuous morphological transitions between these patterns . The numbered diamonds refer to Figure 3 , below .

As an example , a giant unilamellar vesicle of size 10 μ m could engulf 100 nanoparticles of radius 100 nm , and its reduced volume would increase by less than 2 % . Thus , for su ﬃ ciently small nanoparticles , we can ignore the tiny changes in the overall vesicle shape and identify the mean curvature M ms ′ in eq 3 with the mean curvature M ms in eq 2 . This approximation is justi ﬁ ed as long as the overall vesicle shape stays on the same branch of equilibrium shapes as the reduced volume is increased from v to v ′ , that is , unless the vesicle undergoes a shape transition ( see Figure 4 below ) . Furthermore , the relevant properties of the nanoparticles are encoded in the contact mean curvature M co as de ﬁ ned byeq 1 ) . Therefore , the nanoparticle − vesicle morphologies are now determined by only three parameters , namely v , m , and M co ( measured in units of 1 / R ve ) . Now , consider a certain vesicle shape as determined by v and m . Unless the vesicle is perfectly spherical , which corresponds to the limit case v = 1 , the mean curvature M ms will vary along the vesicle membrane in a continuous fashion . As a consequence , such a vesicle will display all membrane curvatures in the closed interval M v , m min ≤ M ms ≤ M v , m max , where M v , m min and M v , m max are the minimal and maximal membrane curvatures of the vesicle . Using the inequalities described above that de ﬁ ne the di ﬀ erent stability regimes , it is now straightforward to determine which types of membrane segments will be present on a given vesicle . The general procedure is illustrated in Figure 2 . A given vesicle can be represented by the closed interval M v , m min ≤ M ms ≤ M v , m max . The M ms - axis is divided up into three nonoverlapping intervals by the two stability limits M ms = M co and M ms = 2 m − M co . It then follows that not all combinations of di ﬀ erent engulfment regimes or engulfment patterns can be found on the same vesicle . For the case m > M co , we ﬁ nd six possible patterns : three single - segment patterns with the whole vesicle being composed of a (cid:4) , (cid:3) , or (cid:1) segment , two two - segment patterns with coexistence of + (cid:3) (cid:4) or + (cid:3) (cid:1) segments , and one three - segment pattern of coexisting + + (cid:3) (cid:1) (cid:4) segments . For the case m < M co , we ﬁ nd again the single - segment (cid:4) and (cid:1) patterns , plus four new possible patterns : a single - segment (cid:2) pattern , two two - segment patterns + (cid:4) (cid:2) and + (cid:1) (cid:2) , and one three - segment pattern + + (cid:1) (cid:4) (cid:2) . Thus , in contrast to the naive expectation that the four di ﬀ erent types of membrane segments might form 2 4 − 1 = 15 di ﬀ erent engulfment patterns , which represents the number of nonempty subsets of a set with four elements , we ﬁ nd that a vesicle can exhibit only ten such patterns : four single - segment patterns , four two - segment patterns , and two three - segment patterns . Furthermore , we can exclude the + (cid:4) (cid:1) two - segment pattern ( apart from the exceptional case M co = m ) and all patterns that contain both an (cid:3) and a (cid:2) segment , compare Figure 2 . We can now use this type of reasoning to quantitatively describe the engulfment patterns present on the equilibrium shapes of free vesicles , as a function of the three free parameters v , m , and M co . In Figure 3 , we illustrate the engulfment patterns as a function of spontaneous curvature m and contact mean curvature M co for a prolate vesicle with reduced volume v = 0 . 98 . The di ﬀ erent engulfment patterns are separated from each other by the four lines L frmin , L frmax , L cemin , and L cemax , corresponding to the stability limits L fr and L ce , as given by eqs 2 and 3 , for the membrane segments of minimal and maximal curvature of the vesicle M ms = M v , m min and M v , m max . In this case , the four lines appear essentially straight because the overall shape of the vesicle Figure 2 . Engulfment regimes (cid:4) , (cid:1) , (cid:3) , or (cid:2) as a function of membrane segment curvature M ms : The possible regimes depend on whether the spontaneous curvature m exceeds the contact mean curvature M co ( top row ) or vice versa ( bottom row ) . The boundaries between the di ﬀ erent regimes follow from the stability limits M ms = M co and M ms = 2 m − M co . For a given shape of the vesicle , all segment curvatures are located within a closed interval M v , m min ≤ M ms ≤ M v , m max , as illustrated by the two shaded rectangles . For m = 0 , these shaded intervals correspond to a prolate ( top ) and a stomatocyte ( bottom ) , see Figure 4 . Figure 3 . Engulfment patterns as a function of contact mean curvature M co and spontaneous curvature m for a prolate vesicle with reduced volume v = 0 . 98 . The solid vertical lines and the dashed tilted lines are given by the stability limits L frmin , L frmax , L cemin , and L cemax ; see text . These four lines partition the ( M co , m ) plane into the four extended regions (cid:3) , (cid:1) , (cid:2) , and (cid:4) , characterized by single - segment patterns , the four stripes + (cid:3) (cid:1) , + (cid:1) (cid:2) , + (cid:4) (cid:2) , and + (cid:3) (cid:4) , corresponding to two - segment patters , and the intersection region of the stripes . The latter region contains the two three - segment patterns + + (cid:3) (cid:1) (cid:4) and + + (cid:1) (cid:4) (cid:2) , which are separated by the dotted line with m = M co ; see inset . The dotted line line also provides a very good approximation to the transition line at which the free and completely engulfed states switch metastability in the bistable (cid:1) region . The horizontal dotted - dashed lines and the numbered diamonds refer to Figure 1 .

In addition , the line M co = m separates the two three - segment patterns + + (cid:3) (cid:1) (cid:4) and + + (cid:1) (cid:4) (cid:2) , and provides a very good approximation to the transition line at which the free and completely engulfed states of the particle switch their metastability in the bistable (cid:1) region . Large positive values of m lead to single - segment patterns with partially engulfed states . In contrast , negative values of m increase the stability of completely engulfed states and enhance the bistability of the system , which may be used to reversibly load and release the nanoparticles in response to external forces . The horizontal dotted − dashed lines and the numbered diamonds refer to Figure 1 , and represent the evolution of the engulfment patterns as a function of increasing particle size or adhesiveness . As seen in Figure 1a , partial engulfment is more persistent at the weakly curved equator of the prolate vesicle . As the contact curvature increases and we cross the vertical line L frmin in Figure 3 , a (cid:4) segment starts to grow continuously from the equator until it covers the whole vesicle when we reach the L frmax line . The (cid:4) segment only starts to shrink once we cross the L cemax line , and disappears at the equator when we cross the line L ce min , the vesicle being now covered by a single (cid:2) segment . In contrast , bistable behavior is favored at the strongly curved poles of the vesicle , from which the (cid:1) segments start to grow and then shrink ; see Figure 1b . In Figure 3 , which applies to reduced volume v = 0 . 98 , the parameter regions with stable two - or three - segment patterns are relatively small and , thus , require ﬁ ne - tuning of the parameters M co and m . Multisegment patterns , on the other hand , become more and more frequent as we decrease the reduced volume v and , thus , increase the di ﬀ erence between M v , m min and M v , m max . This tendency is illustrated in Figure 4 , which displays the engulfment patterns as a function of reduced volume v and contact mean curvature M co for vesicles with spontaneous curvature m = 0 . As the reduced volume v is decreased by osmotic de ﬂ ation , the vesicle undergoes two morphological transitions , from prolates to discocytes and from discocytes to stomatocytes , 20 corresponding to the two horizontal lines in Figure 4 . For the prolate branch , the two - segment regions rapidly expand as the vesicle is de ﬂ ated from a sphere . For the discocyte and stomatocyte branches , one ﬁ nds large regions of the parameter space with stable three - segment patterns . In these regions , partial engulfment is again favored at the segments of lowest membrane curvature , such as at the poles of the discocyte and at the central invagination of the stomatocyte , whereas bistability occurs in the segments of highest membrane curvature . Moving vertically along this engulfment pattern diagram can be easily accomplished experimentally , by simply changing the reduced volume via osmotic de ﬂ ation and in ﬂ ation . In order to obtain the stability regimes for nanoparticles originating from the interior aqueous compartment , we must replace R pa by − R pa in the expression 1 for the contact mean curvature M co , which now decreases for increasing particle size R pa or adhesive strength | W | . The inequalities that de ﬁ ne the di ﬀ erent segment types then change sign , which implies that the stability regimes in Figures 2 , 3 , and 4 are swapped according to ↔ (cid:3) (cid:2) and ↔ (cid:1) (cid:4) . In contrast to the endocytic case , positive spontaneous curvatures and small segment curvatures now enhance bistability , whereas negative sponta - neous curvatures and large segment curvatures promote partial engulfment . In this Letter , we focused on the membrane − particle interactions and ignored possible particle − particle interactions mediated by the membrane . The latter interactions are obviously absent for the (cid:3) segments but should also play no role for (cid:1) and (cid:2) segments because , in the completely engulfed state , the membrane experiences only a local , point - like deformation at the position of the neck , which costs no energy . Thus , completely engulfed particles are unable to “ feel ” each other and are expected to di ﬀ use freely on the (cid:1) and (cid:2) segments . On the other hand , if a completely engulfed particle di ﬀ uses from a (cid:1) or (cid:2) segment into an (cid:3) or (cid:4) segment , it will unbind or partially unwrap from the membrane . The partially engulfed particles within (cid:4) segments may “ feel ” local curvature gradients and can then aggregate into particle clusters . 5 , 29 , 30 However , such a clustering process does not a ﬀ ect the distinction between the (cid:3) , (cid:1) , (cid:2) , and (cid:4) segments and , thus , does not change the engulfment patterns described above . The engulfment patterns described here should be directly observable in the optical microscope using ﬂ uorescently labeled particles . For a membrane with known bending rigidity , the mean contact curvature can be tuned by using nanoparticles of an appropriate material and size . As an example , the adhesive strength between DMPC bilayers and silica was measured 31 to be on the order of | W | ≃ 0 . 5 mJ / m 2 . Using eq 1 and the measured value 32 of the bending rigidity κ ≃ 18 k B T for DMPC bilayers , we see that the contact mean curvature can be varied from M co ≃ − 1 / ( 75 nm ) to + 1 / ( 79 nm ) as we increase the nanoparticle size from R pa = 14 to 22 nm . In addition , the adhesive strength and thus the contact mean curvature may be tuned in a continuous manner by changing the salt concentration of the aqueous solution . 8 Furthermore , the spontaneous curvature of the membrane can be varied over a wide range from | m | ∼ 1 / ( 100 μ m ) to 1 / ( 20 nm ) via asymmetric adsorption of ions , small molecules or larger polymers and proteins , 33 , 34 as well as through the controlled formation of bilayers with compositional asymmetry . 35 − 37 Finally , the reduced volume and therefore the vesicle shape can be controlled using osmotic de ﬂ ation and in ﬂ ation . Figure 4 . Engulfment patterns as a function of contact mean curvature M co and reduced volume v for spontaneous curvature m = 0 . The four lines L frmin , L frmax , and L cemin , and L cemax are now highly curved , compare to Figure 3 , and are discontinuous along the two solid horizontal lines , which represent shape transitions of the free vesicle . The asterisks indicate the precise positions of the displayed 2 - segment and 3 - segment patterns .

These relations depend on two material parameters : the contact mean curvature M co as given by eq 1 , and the spontaneous curvature m , and imply four distinct types of stable membrane segments . As a consequence , a nanoparticle will be either free , partially engulfed , completely engulfed , or show bistability between partially and completely engulfed states , depending on the local curvature of the membrane . For small particle radii , the stability relations can be used to predict ten distinct engulfment patterns on complex membrane shapes as provided , for example , by prolate , discocyte , or stomatocyte vesicles as well as morphological transitions between these patterns , see Figures 1 − 4 . These patterns should be directly observable in the optical microscope using ﬂ uorescently labeled particles . The stability relations ( eqs 2 and 3 ) have been derived for the spontaneous curvature model in ref 14 but should have the same form in the area - di ﬀ erence - elasticity model . 38 The latter model describes bilayer membranes for which one can ignore molecular ﬂ ip - ﬂ ops between the two lea ﬂ ets of the bilayers and , thus , assume that each lea ﬂ et has a ﬁ xed number of molecules irrespective of the membrane shape . For this model , the stability relations ( eqs 2 and 3 ) should again hold provided one replaces the spontaneous curvature m by the e ﬀ ective spontaneous curvature m eff ≡ m − ζ / ( 4 R ve ) with ζ ∼ R pa / R ve . [ The dimensionless quantity ζ is equal to κ κ ̅ − q q ( / ) ( ) 0 where κ ̅ is the second bending rigidity of the area - di ﬀ erence - elasiticity model 38 with κ κ ̅ ≃ / 1 and q denotes the integrated mean curvature ∫ ≡ q AM R d / ve , which attains the value q 0 for the relaxed vesicle shape with an optimal packing of the molecules in both lea ﬂ ets . When the latter shape is quasispherical , one ﬁ nds q − q 0 ≈ ± 4 π R pa / R ve for small size ratios R pa / R ve where the plus and minus sign apply to exo - and endocytosis , respectively . Note that q − q 0 has a ﬁ xed value for a given vesicle shape . ] For the systems considered here , the size R pa of the nanoparticles was taken to be much smaller than the size R ve of the vesicles which implies that the e ﬀ ective spontaneous curvature m eff is approximately equal to the spontaneous curvature m even in the absence of ﬂ ip - ﬂ ops between the bilayer lea ﬂ ets . In the present study , we focused on the engulfment patterns of free vesicles exposed to a single species of nanoparticles in order to demonstrate the far - reaching consequences of the stability relations ( eqs 2 and 3 ) . Because of their local nature , these relations can be generalized to more complex membrane systems . Relatively simple examples are provided by ( i ) binary mixtures of two nanoparticles with di ﬀ erent sizes and ( ii ) vesicle membranes with coexisting membrane domains formed by liquid - ordered and liquid - disordered phases . In case ( i ) , the two particle sizes lead to two di ﬀ erent engulfment patterns which are superimposed on the vesicles . In case ( ii ) , the di ﬀ erent ﬂ uid − elastic parameters of the two membrane phases lead to coexisting engulfment patterns that are con ﬁ ned to the two types of membrane domains . Furthermore , we may consider vesicles that experience external forces or constraints arising , for example , from adhesive surfaces , micropipettes , or optical tweezers . In the latter cases , the stability relations ( eqs 2 and 3 ) remain valid for the “ unperturbed ” membrane segments , that is , for those membrane segments that are neither in contact with other surfaces nor directly exposed to localized external forces . For the “ perturbed ” segments , on the other hand , we can derive generalized stability relations as will be shown in a subsequent paper . Finally , it will be rather interesting to study the engulfment patterns of cellular membranes . The shape of these membranes is often strikingly similar to the shape of vesicles but the particle engulfment usually involves additional processes such as the formation of protein coats in receptor - mediated endocytosis 14 or localized forces arising from the coupling to the cytoskeleton . ■ AUTHOR INFORMATION Corresponding Author * E - mail : lipowsky @ mpikg . mpg . de .

We have emphasized the importance of including the eﬀects of bilayer asymmetry , as quantiﬁed by the membrane spontaneous curvature , on the membrane description . Indeed , the formation of nanotubes in giant vesicles cannot be explained in the absence of spontaneous curvature , as shown in Chapter 2 . Furthermore , in Chapters 3 and 4 we have shown that spontaneous curvature strongly aﬀects the engulfment of particles by model membranes ; and we have provided a satisfactory explanation for the observed size - dependence of clathrin - mediated endocytosis of nanoparticles by cells based on the strong membrane asymmetry induced by the clathrin coat , see Chapter 3 . In Chapter 2 , using numerical energy minimization , we expanded the previously known phase diagram of free vesicle shapes to the regions of very large spontaneous curvature | m | R ve (cid:7) 1 , where R ve is the vesicle size . In this case , osmotic deﬂation of a spherical vesicle initially leads , via an oblate - stomatocyte transition , to the formation of a spherical bud . Upon further deﬂation , there are two competing kinetic pathways : the ﬁrst pathway leads to the creation of new buds , whereas the second pathway makes existing buds grow into necklace - like nanotubes . Furthermore , we describe for the ﬁrst time a transition between necklace - like and cylindrical tubes that occurs once the tubes reach a certain critical length . This increased understanding of nanotube shapes allows one to deduce the spontaneous curvature of the membrane by optical imaging of the nanotubes . Membrane nanotubes connected to vesicles are an interesting model system for the mem - brane area reservoirs present in cells , see Figure 1 . 4 . These area reservoirs equip cells with increased versatility and robustness , as in the case of phagocytic cells , which can increase their apparent surface area by up to 400 % , implying that up to 80 % of their membrane area is stored in hidden reservoirs , see Section 1 . 2 . 2 . In the experiments described in Chapter 2 , up to 20 % of the total membrane area was stored in the tubes , but there is in principle no reason why this number should be an upper limit . Indeed , further deﬂation should lead to more area stored in nanotubes . The added complexity caused by the presence of aqueous phase - separation within the vesicle in the experiments of Chapter 2 can be avoided by using solutions of only PEG and sucrose . It will be interesting to see if vesicles with nanotubes show increased robustness , as in the case of biological cells . Indeed , as explained in Section 1 . 5 . 2 , the interaction of initially 117 5 Summary and Outlook spherical vesicles ( in the absence of nanotubes ) with large strongly adhesive particles leads to vesicle rupture . This can be easily understood , as lipid membranes can only stretch by typically 4 % before rupturing . The engulfment of a particle of radius R pa requires a spherical vesicle of radius R ve to stretch by a factor R 2 pa / R 2 ve . This implies that a vesicle will rupture when brought in contact with strongly adhesive particles if the particle radius is larger than √ 0 . 04 R ve = R ve / 5 . In contrast , a spherical vesicle with apparent radius R ve and 20 % of its area stored in nanotubes could in principle engulf of the order of 0 . 2 R 2 ve / R 2 pa particles of radius R pa before starting to stretch . The same argument for added robustness in the presence of nanotubes should apply to vesicles squeezing through pores , or vesicles containing active matter such as a reconstituted actin cortex . In the ﬁrst part of Chapter 3 , we examined in detail the eﬀects of membrane asymmetry as well as vesicle size on particle engulfment , which were previously unexplored . Using extensive numerical energy minimization , as well as theoretical considerations , we obtained two analytical conditions for the stability of the free and completely engulfed states of a particle . These two instability conditions completely determine the engulfment behavior . The instability of the free state was found to be independent of the membrane spontaneous curvature , whereas the instability of the completely engulfed state is dependent on the spontaneous curvature . We proposed an experimental method by which the membrane spontaneous curvature and the adhesive strength of the particle – membrane interactions can be deduced from image analysis of experiments or simulations in which membranes are put in contact with particles of diﬀerent sizes . Whereas the analysis of nanotube shapes is useful in measuring very large spontaneous curvatures | m | R ve (cid:7) 1 , where R ve is the vesicle size , analysis of particle engulfment gives access to small spontaneous curvatures of the order of the vesicle size | m | R ve ∼ 1 , which are typically more elusive . It will be exciting to see if this method can be applied in experiments . In the second part of Chapter 3 , we examined the case of adhesion - induced segregation of membrane components by the adhering particle . The theory that we developed is in principle applicable to any multi - component membrane in which some lipid species or membrane - anchored molecules have a higher aﬃnity for the particle than the others . This would be the case , for example , if a charged particle interacts with a membrane made of a mixture of charged lipids of opposite charges , or of a charged lipid with a neutral lipid . In general , the membrane segment bound to the particle will have diﬀerent composition and thus diﬀerent elastic properties than the unbound membrane segment . Of most interest is the limit case in which the bound segment has a much larger spontaneous curvature than the unbound segment , as is the case in the strongly asymmetric protein coats occurring during clathrin - mediated endocytosis by cells . We showed that , in this case , only intermediate - sized particles that are between a lower and an upper threshold can be engulfed . We obtained analytical expressions for the engulfment rate and total uptake of particles by cells , that can explain the experimentally observed size - distribution of gold 118 nanoparticle uptake by HeLa cells . When compared to previous models , our theory does not depend on the depletion of receptors from the cell membrane , which is a problematic assumption , see Section 1 . 5 . 3 . In Chapter 4 , we used the analytical conditions of the free and completely engulf states to examine engulfment on nanoparticles at non - axisymmetric locations of vesicles . This would be extremely diﬃcult to do using direct energy minimization , see Section 1 . 6 . We found that the fate of a particle is strongly dependent on the local curvature of the vesicle at the point of contact with the particle . As a consequence , vesicles with a complex shape of non - uniform curvature will display membrane segments in which particles remain free , others in which particles may be partially or completely engulfed , as well as segments were particles show bistability between the free and the completely engulfed states . We showed that , when exposed to many nanoparticles , a homogeneous vesicle can simul - taneously display up to three such diﬀerent segments on their surface , thereby forming distinct engulfment patterns . We found that there are only ten possible engulfment patterns , and described in detail the transitions between them as a function of the vesicle shape and spontaneous curvature , as well as particle size and adhesiveness . These patterns should be observable under optical microscope by using ﬂuorescently labeled particles . Given the generality of our approach based on the two instability conditions , our results can be directly extended to more complex cases such as phase - separated membranes , or vesicles in contact with mixtures of particles made from diﬀerent materials or sizes . To conclude , we hope to have shown that membrane remodeling processes are strongly af - fected by the asymmetry of the bilayer , which is too often neglected in theoretical treatments . We have provided new analytical tools for researchers to quantify this bilayer asymmetry in experiments or simulations . In addition , our analytical instability conditions for the en - gulfment of particles by membranes allow for a very thorough understanding of engulfment processes without the need to perform numerical calculations .
