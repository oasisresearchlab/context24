As the centrosome is surrounded by various dense components , we hypothesized that the centrosome may be bordered by a putative diffusion barrier . After quantitatively measuring the trapping kinetics of soluble proteins of varying size at centrosomes by a chemically inducible diffusion trapping assay , we found that centrosomes were highly accessible to soluble molecules with a Stokes radius of ≤ 5 . 1 nm , whereas larger molecules rarely reach centrosomes , indicating the existence of a size - dependent diffusion barrier at centrosomes . The permeability of barriers was tightly regulated by branched actin filaments outside of centrosomes . Such barrier gated the microtubule nucleation . We propose that actin filaments spatiotemporally constrain the distribution of molecules at centrosomes in a size - dependent manner . Significance Statement Centrosome maintains its microenvironment without membrane . Whether the dense protein complexes outside centrosomes including pericentriolar matrix , microtubules , and branched actin filaments provide physical obstruction is unclear yet . We here established a series of new tools for quantitative evaluation of the diffusion rates of varisized soluble proteins in different sub - compartments of centrosomes . Our results demonstrated that branched actin filaments , but not pericentriolar matrix or microtubules , around centrosome have acted as a size - dependent diffusion barrier and physically constrain centrosome microtubule nucleation . Introduction Precise regulation of protein distribution and dynamics ensures proper cellular function and architecture , defects of which are associated with degenerative and neoplastic diseases ( 1 , 2 ) . Whereas active transport requires energy for molecules to move to their destination , soluble molecules diffuse down a concentration gradient without energy expenditure in passive transport ( 3 ) . To conduct local reactions , cells compartmentalize soluble molecules spatiotemporally by using diffusion barriers in various forms such as nuclear pore complexes , dendritic spine necks , axon initial segments , and ciliary pore complexes ( 3 – 6 ) . These passive permeable diffusion barriers serve as conduits between different subcellular compartments and regulate the movement of soluble molecules across adjacent pools . Diffusion barrier deficiency results in protein mislocation / dislocation , which causes several known human diseases ( 4 , 7 , 8 ) . Eukaryotic cells contain endomembrane systems to compartmentalize molecules in membranous organelles for executing different functions ( 9 ) . Unlike most organelles , the centrosome is a non - membranous organelle ; however , it is still capable of assembling hundreds of specific molecules locally and maintaining its microenvironment within the cytosol pool . These attributes ensure its proper architecture and function in terms of microtubule nucleation ( 10 , 11 ) and formation of the primary cilium , an important protruding structure on the cell surface for sensing extracellular stimuli ( 10 , 12 – 14 ) . Many scaffold proteins serve as platforms to recruit centrosomal molecules from the cytosolic pool . Moreover , it is well known that the highly dense protein matrix that is present in confined areas is capable of forming permeable diffusion barriers ( 15 ) . Based on the previous observation that centrosomes are embedded in a cloud of proteins known as the pericentriolar matrix , and emanating microtubules as well as branched actin filaments ( 16 , 17 ) , we hypothesized that a putative diffusion barrier may exist around centrosomes to constrain the distribution and dynamics of centrosomal molecules . To investigate the diffusion behavior of soluble molecules , several conventional approaches including single - particle tracking , fluorescence correlation spectroscopy , fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) , and tracking photoactivatable fluorescence proteins or microinjected molecules have been widely applied ( 18 – 27 ) . However , the diffusion behaviors of molecules uncovered by these conventional methods are determined by both their intrinsic diffusion rates and extrinsic affinity for other immobile scaffolds , which cannot be easily uncoupled . To faithfully uncover the diffusion rates of soluble molecules independently of extrinsic interference , we applied a chemically inducible diffusion trap ( CIDT ) , a previously developed approach , which permits the monitoring of molecule diffusion rates in specific subcellular sites while avoiding interactions between probes and immobile scaffolds in close proximity ( 3 , 18 , 28 ) . With the CIDT approach , we have identified a size - dependent diffusion barrier consisting of actin filaments as the key component around centrosomes . Results Establishment of centrosome - specific CIDT systems We first describe how to use the CIDT approach to probe diffusion barriers . CIDT in living cells involves three components : rapamycin , a naturally occurring chemical dimerizer ; FK506 - rapamycin - binding domain ( FRB ) ; and immunophilin FK506 - binding protein - 12 ( FKBP ) ( 29 ) . Introduction of rapamycin swiftly dimerizes FRB with nearby molecules of FKBP ( Fig . 1a ) ( 30 ) . Typically , FRB molecules are tagged with a known targeting sequence ( TS in Fig . 1a ) and consequently anchored to regions of interest ( ROIs ) , whereas FKBP molecules are tagged with diffusive probes ( FKBP - probes ) that uniformly distribute in the cytosolic pool . When the diffusion probes can access FRB - ROIs , the addition of rapamycin rapidly induces FRB / FKBP dimerization and consequently traps FKBP - probes from the cytosol onto FRB - ROIs ( Fig . 1a ) . In the presence of a diffusion barrier , however , the barrier can block certain FKBP - probes from the ROI ( Fig . 1a ) . In addition to accessibility , the trapping kinetics of FKBP - probes depend on their diffusion rates across cytosolic pools to FRB - ROIs . By measuring the kinetics of variably sized FKBP - probes that are trapped by FRB - ROIs , putative size - dependent diffusion barriers around FRB - ROIs can be characterized ( 3 , 18 ) . CIDT has been successfully used to identify a size - dependent diffusion barrier at the base of the primary cilium ( 18 ) , which was also confirmed by other assays ( 31 ) . To explore putative diffusion barriers at centrosomes , we constrained FRB molecules at centrosomes by tagging FRB with centrosome - targeting sequences ( CTSs ) ( Fig . 1b ) . It is necessary to select CTSs with low shuttling and highly sustained localization at the designated centrosomal sub - compartments in an attempt to focus on probe diffusion and avoid interference from the active transport of probes , as would be facilitated by CTSs that are highly mobile . Therefore , we took advantage of the FRAP assay to explore and evaluate the dynamics of several previously identified CTS candidates including CEP120C ( C terminus of CEP120 , which localizes at the centriolar outer wall ) ( 32 ) , CEP170C ( C terminus of CEP170 , which localizes at subdistal appendages ) ( 33 ) , PACT ( C terminus of Pericentrin , which localizes at the pericentriolar matrix ) , Centrin2 ( which localizes to the centriolar lumen ) ( 34 ) , and PCM1F2 ( F2 domain of PCM1 , which localizes at centriolar satellites ) ( 35 ) . Among these , green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) - tagged CEP120C and CEP170C showed the most rapid recovery after photobleaching ( Supplementary Fig . 1a - c ) with highly mobile fractions ( > 20 % ) and low recovery half - time ( < 60 sec ) ( Supplementary Fig . 1c ) , indicating constant centrosome cytoplasmic shuttling of CEP120C and CEP170C . Meanwhile , PCM1F2 , PACT , and Centrin2 were capable of constraining a cyan fluorescent protein , Cerulean3 ( Ce3 ) , and the FRB molecule in specific sub - compartments of centrosomes ( Ce3 - FRB - Centrin2 at centrioles ; PACT - Ce3 - FRB at the pericentriolar matrix ; PCM1F2 - Ce3 - FRB at centriolar satellites ; Supplementary Fig . 2 ) , show a low shuttling rate with a low mobile fraction ( < 20 % in 5 min ) ( Supplementary Fig . 1b - c ) , making them suitable CTSs for the CIDT system . We confirmed that rapamycin treatment triggers the trapping of cytosolic FKBP - tagged probes in the ROIs where the corresponding CTS - FRB proteins reside by co - expressing yellow fluorescent protein ( YFP ) - tagged FKBP ( YFP - FKBP ; Stokes radius [ Rs ] , 3 . 2 nm ; molecular weight , 40 kDa ) with PCM1F2 - Ce3 - FRB , PACT - Ce3 - FRB , and Ce3 - FRB - Centrin2 in U2Os cells , a cell type derived from a human osteosarcoma that exhibits clear centrosomal structures . ( Fig . 2a ; Supplementary videos 1 - 3 , left ) . The accumulation of YFP - FKBP onto each centrosome locale quickly reached a plateau level , probably due to the full occupancy of FRB binding sites locally ( Fig . 2b ) . The half - time ( t 1 / 2 ) values for translocation of YFP - FKBP onto centrioles , the pericentriolar matrix , and centriolar satellites were all similar ( centrioles : 12 . 15 ± 2 . 27 sec ; pericentriolar matrix : 13 . 83 ± 3 . 09 sec ; centriolar satellites : 7 . 24 ± 0 . 46 sec ; Table 1 ) . This confirmed the applicability of the centrosome CIDT method in our subsequent experiments . Recruiting varisized diffusion probes onto centrosomes We investigated the diffusion of varisized proteins at three centrosome locales in U2Os cells . Native Rs ( Stoke radius ) for YFP - FKBP , YFP - FKBP - Grp1 , YFP - FKBP - Luciferase , YFP - FKBP - Tiam1 , YFP - FKBP - D N b - Gal , and YFP - FKBP - b - Gal were 3 . 2 , 4 . 1 , 4 . 5 , 5 . 1 , 6 . 3 , and 7 . 6 nm , with molecular weights of 40 , 57 , 100 , 124 , 322 , and 659 kDa , respectively , according to previous measurements ( Table 1 ) ( 18 ) . We next co - expressed PCM1F2 - Ce3 - FRB and each of the YFP - FKBP - tagged probes in U2Os cells . All varisized diffusion probes immediately translocated onto the centrosome peripheral , centriolar satellites , within 13 sec upon rapamycin treatment ( Fig . 3a , b , left , Supplementary Fig . 3 , Table 1 , and Supplementary video 1 ) . Interestingly , whereas probes with an Rs as large as 5 . 1 nm still showed rapid translocation onto all three centrosomal sub - compartments , YFP - FKBP - D N b - Gal ( 6 . 3 nm ) and YFP - FKBP - b - Gal ( 7 . 6 nm ) had not been recruited onto the pericentriolar matrix and centriolar lumen by 5 min ( Fig . 3a , b , middle and right ; Supplementary Figs . 4 , 5 , Table 1 , and Supplementary videos 2 , 3 ) . We further quantified the translocation probability by extending the translocation time to 2 hr after trapping the diffusive probes by rapamycin treatment . Cells transfected with 18 combinations of one CFP - FRB - ROI and one YFP - FKBP - tagged probe representing each condition were treated with rapamycin for 2 hr ( Table 1 ) . The rapamycin groups demonstrated a tendency to decline in their translocation rate as the size of the diffusive probes increased . The translocation rates were high and the differences were subtle between probes with Rs of ≤ 5 . 1 nm at the periphery of the centrosome ( centriolar satellites ) . However , the change in translocation rates was especially drastic at the core centrosomal regions ( pericentriolar matrix and centrioles ) for probes with Rs ≥ 6 . 3 nm . The translocation probability of YFP - FKBP - D N b - Gal ( Rs , 6 . 3 nm ) at the pericentriolar matrix and centrioles showed a nearly twofold change , similar for YFP - b - Gal ( Rs , 7 . 6 nm ) , which had an even lower translocation rate of 10 ± 3 % at the centrioles after a 2 - hr rapamycin treatment ( Table 1 ) . In conclusion , the diffusion kinetics of soluble proteins ranging from an Rs of 3 . 2 to 7 . 6 nm ( 40 - 659 kDa ) at centriolar satellites were similar , whereas their diffusion / accumulation at the pericentriolar matrix and centrioles showed a negative correlation . The probability of accessing peripheral centriolar satellites for soluble diffusive probes with Rs ≥ 6 . 3 nm ( 322 kDa ) is still high but plummets at the pericentriolar matrix and centrioles . The poor accessibility of large probes to the centrosome core is not determined by their diffusivity in the cytosol , as the trapping kinetics of those probes to centriolar satellites and to the plasma membrane are all rapid ( Fig . 3 , Supplementary Figs . 3 , 6 ; Table 1 ; Supplementary video 1 ) . Given that the rapid recruitment occurred within a minute , the mTOR pathway was not likely to contribute to the diffusive effect despite the addition of rapamycin . Taken together , these results revealed the existence of a size - dependent diffusion barrier between the core centrosomes and cytosol pool . Actin filaments contribute to the centrosomal diffusion barrier We next aimed to explore the molecular components of the centrosomal diffusion barriers . Centrosomes are known to be microtubule - and actin - organizing centers that are surrounded by these cytoskeletal elements ( 10 , 11 , 36 – 38 ) . We hypothesized that either microtubules or actin filaments contribute to the function and composition of centrosomal diffusion barriers , as it is known that the cytoskeleton not only provides mechanical support but also serves as a critical component of permeable passive barriers in cells ( 39 ) . To examine the role of microtubules in centrosomal diffusion barriers , U2Os cells were treated with Nocodazole to depolymerize the cellular microtubule polymers to soluble tubulins ( 40 ) . An immunostaining assay confirmed that microtubule depolymerization occurred 10 - 20 min after Nocodazole treatment ( Fig . 4a ) . We then carried out the CIDT assay on cells with either intact or depolymerized microtubules . Live - cell imaging showed that YFP - FKBP - ∆ Nβ - Gal was blocked from entering centrioles even after microtubule depolymerization , indicating that the contribution of microtubules with respect to the diffusion barrier was rather trivial ( Fig . 4b , c ) . We next investigated the role of actin filaments . Centrosomes are surrounded by Arp2 / 3 - associated branched actin - filaments ( 41 ) . We disrupted actin filaments in U2Os cells by the addition of CK666 , an Arp2 / 3 inhibitor ( 42 , 43 ) , which perturbs actin polymerization ( 44 ) . Immunofluorescence results showed the reduction in actin filaments around the centrosomes after 2 hr of CK666 treatment ( Fig . 4d ) . A CIDT assay in the presence of CK666 showed that the decrease in centrosomal actin filaments allowed the entry of YFP - FKBP - D N b - Gal , which could not access the centriolar lumen in the absence of CK666 ( Fig . 4e , f ) , indicating the substantial contribution of actin filaments to the composition of the centrosomal size - dependent diffusion barrier . The permeability of centrosomal diffusion barriers decreases in anaphase At anaphase , an increase in the amount of branched actin around centrosomes was observed ( 45 ) . We therefore tried to characterize the permeability of centrosomal diffusion barriers in anaphase cells . In interphase HeLa cells , YFP - FKBP - Luciferase could access PACT - labeled pericentriolar matrix ( Fig . 5 ; Supplementary Video 4 ) . However , the entry of YFP - FKBP - Luciferase onto centrosomes was blocked in anaphase cells , indicating the permeability of centrosomal diffusion barriers temporally decreased during anaphase ( Fig . 5 ; Supplementary Video 4 ) . The actin - based diffusion barrier physically regulates 𝑟 - TuRC and microtubule nucleation The centrosome acts as a microtubule organizing center via recruiting the 𝑟 - tubulin ring complex ( 𝑟 - TuRC ) , a key protein complex ( Rs : ~ 15 nm ) ( 46 ) required for microtubule nucleation , onto centrosome ( 47 ) . We tried to examine whether the centrosome diffusion barrier gates the recruitment of 𝑟 - TuRC at centrosomes . The density of one major component in 𝑟 - TuRC , 𝑟 - tubulin , in control and CK666 - treated centrosomes was labeled and quantified . Disruption of actin - based diffusion barriers significantly increased the amount of 𝑟 - tubulin at centrosomes ( Fig . 6a , b ) . We next transfected U2Os cells with EB1 - mNeon , a microtubule plus - end marker tagged with a green / yellow fluorescent protein , mNeon , to track microtubule growth ( 25 µm in diameter ) in the cells with either an intact or disrupted ( CK666 treated ) diffusion barrier ( Fig . 6c ) . We quantitatively measured the frequency of microtubule nucleation and the microtubule elongation rate , events indicative of microtubule growth in the centrosome core region and in the cytosol , respectively . The number of nascent microtubules derived from centrosomes was significantly increased in the absence of a diffusion barrier as compared with that in control cells ( Fig . 6d ) . Disruption of the diffusion barrier did not , however , affect the elongation rate of microtubules in cytosol ( Fig . 6e ) . These results suggest that recruitment of 𝑟 - TuRC and initiation of microtubule growth around centrosomes were hindered by the diffusion barrier , whereas their elongation rate was not perturbed after they had elongated away from the centrosome . Discussion We here established a centrosome - specific CIDT system that enables rapid recruitment of varisized cytosolic diffusive probes to three centrosome locales , ranging from the core to the periphery . Diffusive probes with an Rs of ≤ 5 . 1 nm ( 124 kDa ) can freely access all centrosome sub - compartments , whereas the accessibility of large diffusive probes was hindered . Probes with an Rs of ≥ 6 . 3 nm ( 322 kDa ) could not reach the pericentriolar matrix and centrioles , indicating the existence of a size - dependent diffusion barrier outside the centrosomal core region . The centrosomal diffusion barrier was perturbed after disruption of branched actin filaments . Disruption of the centrosomal diffusion barrier enabled the entry of large molecules and 𝑟 - TuRC as well as increased microtubule nucleation . The permeability of actin - based barriers was temporally decrease in anaphase . In summary , these results suggest that actin - based diffusion barriers outside of centrosomes spatiotemporally gate the diffusion of molecules in a size - dependent manner . According to our CIDT results , cytosolic molecules with an Rs of ≤ 5 . 1 nm can freely access centrosomal core regions . Therefore , most cytosolic components , such as small proteins , metabolites , ions , mRNAs , and others , are able to reach the interior of centrosomes . Intuitively , anchoring via their affinity for centrosomal scaffold proteins should be the major mechanism by which small molecules are retained at centrosomes for local reactions . Conversely , without active transport mediated by motor proteins , large molecules ( Rs ³ 6 . 3 nm ; 322 kDa ) such as protein complexes , aggresomes , and ribosomes are prohibited from centrosomes . For example , proteasomes are soluble protein complexes that locally trigger proteolytic degradation at centrosomes ( 48 ) . Because of their very large size ( 20 S proteasome : ~ 750 kDa ) ( 49 ) , we assume that proteasomes cannot access centrosomal core region to directly trigger protein degradation . Alternatively , centrosomal proteins may diffuse to the cytosol pool that is proximal to centrosomes for proteasome - mediated degradation . Indeed , excess centrosomal proteins and misfolded proteins accumulate in regions proximal to centrosomes upon inhibition of proteasome activity , which supports our assumption ( 48 , 50 ) . We demonstrated that branched actin filaments act as a diffusion barrier around centrosomes . Branched actin filaments are also abundant in dendritic spines , the axonal initial segment , and other subcellular regions ( 51 – 53 ) . Not surprisingly , the dense actin meshwork in these sites also functions as a diffusion barrier . Actin filaments in dendritic spines restrict the mobility of proteins larger than 100 kDa . This restriction is reduced during actin reformation in structural plasticity or after actin filaments are severed by latrunculin A ( 46 ) . The actin - based diffusion barrier in axonal initial segments ensures axon integrity and neuron cell polarity by preventing dendric protein - positive vesicles from accessing the axonal lumen ( 54 ) . As centrosomes are transformed into basal bodies at the entrance to the lumen of the primary cilium during G0 phase , we assumed that centrosomal diffusion barriers may also halt the entry of cytosolic molecules into the ciliary lumen . However , previous studies demonstrated that proteins with an Rs as large as 7 . 9 nm can access the ciliary lumen ( 18 , 31 ) . One possible explanation for this is that centrosomal diffusion barriers do not span the entire ciliary base . Ultrastructural observations of branched actin filaments and the ciliary base are needed to confirm this assumption . Recently , the discovery of phase - separation mechanisms in cells has provided new insights into how non - membrane - bound components assemble and maintain their structures ( 55 , 56 ) . The organelles with phase transition properties generate a gel - like microenvironment in which to concentrate centrosomal molecules locally and to separate this compartment physically from the cytosol ( 57 ) . However , whether this centrosomal condensate results in any restrictions on solute mobility is still unclear . According to our CIDT results , the accessibility of molecules at centrioles and the pericentriolar matrix is similar , indicating that cytosol molecules smaller than 124 kDa can freely diffuse across the pericentriolar matrix and reach the centriolar wall . Moreover , disruption of branched actin filaments allows the trapping of YFP - FKBP - ∆Nβ - Gal ( 320 kDa ) at centrioles . These results indicated that the pericentriolar matrix does not hinder the diffusion of molecules as large as 124 kDa . Previous studies demonstrated that centrosomal branched actin acts as a negative regulator of microtubule nucleation ( 45 , 58 ) . However , how branched actin at the centrosome suppresses microtubule nucleation is still unclear . Our results indicated that branched actin prevented large molecules from crossing the centrosome boundary . It is thus plausible that microtubule nucleation would also be physically hindered , although microtubule elongation , which occurs outside of the centrosomes , was not affected by diffusion barriers . The approaches developed here have powerful applications beyond probing diffusion mechanisms . Chemically inducible dimerization systems have been widely used to spatiotemporally manipulate cellular architecture and signaling by recruiting proteins of interest ( Rs of ≤ 5 . 1 nm ) onto target sites in cells ( 18 , 59 – 61 ) . The current study has established a new system that enables rapid recruitment of proteins of interest onto the centrioles , pericentriolar matrix , or centriolar satellites within seconds . It offers a feasible way to spatiotemporally manipulate molecular signaling at three different centrosomal sub - compartments . This approach should allow us to address previously intractable questions in centrosome biology , a discipline that has a strong translational link to a variety of centrosome - related diseases .

Using the CIDT system to probe a putative centrosomal diffusion barrier . ( a ) With the CIDT ( chemically inducible diffusion trapping ) system , YFP - FKBP - tagged diffusive protein probes ( FKBP - probes ) ranging from 40 to 659 kDa ( 3 . 2 nm to 7 . 6 nm ) were used to probe the putative diffusion barrier in cells . FRB was localized to region of interest ( ROI ) by tagging with the targeting sequence of ROI ( TS ) . Theoretically , in the absence of a barrier ( middle panel ) , probes can freely access and be trapped at ROI via rapamycin ( Rapa ) - triggered FRB / FKBP dimerization ; in the presence of a barrier ( lower panel ) , probe diffusion can be hindered and , thus , dimerization obstructed . ( b ) To explore the precise location of putative diffusion barriers at centrosomes , FRB ( R ) was tagged to localize to three different sub - compartments of centrosomes , the centriolar satellites ( I ) , pericentriolar matrix ( II ) , and centrioles ( III ) . The accessibility of FKBP ( K ) - tagged diffusion probes of various sizes to centrosomes was tested by the CIDT system . Figure 2 .
