Davis , Renee C . Ireton , and Albert B . Reynolds Department of Cancer Biology , Vanderbilt University , Nashville , TN 37232 120 - catenin stabilizes epithelial cadherin ( E - cadherin ) in SW48 cells , but the mechanism has not been estab - lished . Here , we show that p120 acts at the cell surface to control cadherin turnover , thereby regulating cadherin levels . p120 knockdown by siRNA expression resulted in dose - dependent elimination of epithelial , placental , neuronal , and vascular endothelial cadherins , and complete p loss of cell – cell adhesion . ARVCF and (cid:2) - catenin were functionally redundant , suggesting that proper cadherin - dependent adhesion requires the presence of at least one p120 family member . The data reveal a core function of p120 in cadherin complexes , and strongly predict a dose - dependent loss of E - cadherin in tumors that partially or completely down - regulate p120 . Introduction p120 - catenin ( p120 ) is the prototypic and most abundant member of an Arm - domain protein subfamily that includes ARVCF , (cid:2) - catenin , and p0071 ( for review see Anastasiadis and Reynolds , 2000 ) . p120 was originally described as a substrate for Src - and receptor tyrosine kinases ( Reynolds et al . , 1989 , 1992 ) , and later was identified as a catenin ( Reynolds et al . , 1994 ; Shibamoto et al . , 1995 ) , one of several cofactors that interact with the cadherin tail and modulate cadherin function ( for review see Anastasiadis and Reynolds , 2000 ) . The classical catenins , (cid:3) - and (cid:4) - catenin , bridge the cadherin cytoplasmic domain to the underlying actin cytoskeleton . p120 is required to stabilize epithelial cadherin ( E - cadherin ) in SW48 cells ( Ireton et al . , 2002 ) , and may also regulate cadherin – cytoskeletal connections indirectly through functional interactions with Rho GTPases ( Anastasiadis et al . , 2000 ; Noren et al . , 2000 ; Grosheva et al . , 2001 ; Magie et al . , 2002 ; for review see Anastasiadis and Reynolds , 2001 ) , but the underlying mechanisms have not been established . E - cadherin is the main cell – cell adhesion molecule in epithelial tissues and is regarded as a master organizer of the epithelial phenotype ( Takeichi , 1995 ) . Direct mutation of the E - cadherin gene in gastric and lobular breast carcinomas indicates a classical tumor suppressor role in some tumors ( Oda et al . , 1994 ; Berx et al . , 1995 ) . In late - stage carcinomas of all types , E - cadherin down - regulation occurs frequently via epigenetic mechanisms ( Comijn et al . , 2001 ; Matsumura et al . , 2001 ) and is closely correlated with the transition to metastasis ( Frixen et al . , 1991 ; Vleminckx et al . , 1991 ; Birchmeier and Behrens , 1994 ; Perl et al . , 1998 ) . Together , these data establish E - cadherin as a tumor and / or metastasis suppressor , depending on the mechanism and timing of E - cadherin down - regulation ( for review see Yap , 1998 ; Nollet et al . , 1999 ) . In the event of E - cadherin down - regulation , (cid:3) - and (cid:4) - catenins are rapidly degraded ( Nagafuchi et al . , 1991 ) via an adenomatous polyposis coli – dependent mechanism ( Po - lakis , 2000 ) that ultimately targets (cid:4) - catenin for destruction by the proteosome ( for review see Kikuchi , 2000 ) . In contrast , p120 is stable in the absence of cadherins and becomes stranded in the cytoplasm ( Thoreson et al . , 2000 ) . Ourselves and others have postulated that cytoplasmic p120 actively drives the metastatic phenotype in cadherin - deficient cells through inappropriate activation / suppression of various Rho - GTPases such as Rac1 and RhoA ( Anastasiadis et al . , 2000 ; Noren et al . , 2000 ; Anastasiadis and Reynolds , 2001 ; Grosheva et al . , 2001 ) . These data suggest a metastasis promoter role for p120 when mislocalized through prior loss of E - cadherin . Down - regulation of p120 occurs frequently in colon , prostate , breast , lung , and other carcinoma types ( for review see Thoreson and Reynolds , 2002 ) , but the consequences are unknown . Paradoxically , it is rare to see p120 down - regulation in established tumor cell lines . The lone exception is the SW48 colon carcinoma cell line , where genetic alterations result in extremely low levels of a mutated p120 that lacks the carboxy terminus ( Ireton et al . , 2002 ) .

Th e J ou r n a l o f C e ll B i o l o gy 526 The Journal of Cell Biology | Volume 163 , Number 3 , 2003 levels of full - length p120 expression in these poorly orga - nized cells stabilized E - cadherin and caused a striking rescue of epithelial morphology . Thus , in SW48 cells at least , p120 appears to be essential for E - cadherin stability and function ( Ireton et al . , 2002 ) . On the other hand , recent reports in Drosophila ( Myster et al . , 2003 ; Pacquelet et al . , 2003 ) and Caenorhabditis elegans ( Pettitt et al . , 2003 ) indicate that p120 is not essential , and that its absence causes only minor defects that are not fully apparent unless complemented by weak alleles of E - cadherin or (cid:3) - catenin . Here , to clarify the role of p120 in mammalian cells , we have knocked down p120 with siRNA in cells expressing ep - ithelial ( E - ) , placental ( P - ) , neuronal ( N - ) , and vascular en - dothelial ( VE - ) cadherins . We report that each of these cad - herins , as well as (cid:3) - and (cid:4) - catenins , were rapidly degraded in the absence of p120 , resulting in loss of cell – cell adhesion . The effect was clearly dose dependent , indicating that p120 expression levels may directly determine cadherin levels . Degradation of p120 - uncoupled cadherin occurred after its arrival at the surface , indicating that p120 regulates cadherin turnover at the level of internalization or recycling . p120 ho - mologues ARVCF and (cid:2) - catenin could substitute for p120 , so at least one family member is likely required to maintain adhesion . Thus , cadherin complexes are rapidly turned over and degraded in mammalian cells in the absence of direct in - teraction with p120 or a p120 family member . These obser - vations establish a core function for p120 in the cadherin complex and have additional implications in support of a role for p120 in tumor suppression . Results p120 loss leads to loss of the cadherin complex To directly address the general consequences of p120 defi - ciency , we stably expressed p120 - specific siRNA using the pRetroSuper ( pRS ) retrovirus to knockdown p120 in mam - malian cell lines ( Fig . 1 ) . Human and murine p120 siRNAs ( h siRNA and m siRNA , respectively ) were generated against homologous human and murine sequences that dif - fer by three mismatches at the nucleotide level ( Fig . 1 a ) . Pi - Figure 1 . p120 knockdown eliminates the E - cadherin complex and abolishes adhesion . ( a ) Human and murine p120 siRNAs ( h siRNA and m siRNA , respectively ) were generated against homologous human and murine sequences that contain three mismatches at the nucleotide level ( asterisks ) . ( b ) Schematic depicting a novel method for in vitro p120 knock - down and knock - up . Human p120 was knocked down using the retroviral vector pRS to express human - specific p120 siRNA , and stable cell lines were selected . p120 was then reexpressed ( knock - up ) by infecting the knock - down cell line with an LZRS retrovirus containing murine p120 cDNA . ( c ) Wild - type A431 cells ( lane 1 ) were infected with virus carrying the control m siRNA ( lane 2 ) or h siRNA ( lane 3 ) , and stable cell lines were isolated . p120 expression was restored ( knock - up ) by infecting h siRNA – expressing cells with retrovirus containing murine p120 ( lane 4 ) . The indicated cadherin complex proteins were analyzed by Western blotting whole cell lysates . E - cadherin , (cid:4) - catenin , and (cid:3) - catenin levels were substantially reduced in p120 knockdown cells , and restoring p120 reversed the effect . ( d ) p120 ( i and vii ) , E - cadherin ( ii and viii ) , (cid:4) - catenin ( iii and ix ) , (cid:3) - catenin ( iv and x ) , tubulin ( v and xi ) , and vinculin ( vi and xii ) were localized by immunofluorescence in stable A431 cell lines expressing the control m siRNA ( i – vi ) or h siRNA ( vii – xii ) . Cells were plated sparsely to allow colonies to emerge from single cells . Note that p120 knockdown cells lack cadherin complexes and have lost cell – cell adhesion . The cadherin complex is selectively targeted because the levels of tubulin and vinculin are unaffected . Th e J ou r n a l o f C e ll B i o l o gy p120 regulates cadherin turnover | Davis et al . 527 lot experiments revealed that the h siRNA strongly knocked down p120 levels in human cells , but not murine cells , and vice versa . E - cadherin levels were also severely reduced by p120 knockdown in several different epithelial cell lines . These data indicate that the stabilizing effect of p120 is not limited to SW48 cells , but represents a mechanism that is likely common to all E - cadherin – expressing cells . By intentionally targeting the above siRNA oligos to human and murine sequences that differed by several nucleotides , it was relatively straightforward to efficiently “knock down” p120 with the human - directed siRNA ( pRS - h siRNA ) and subsequently “knock up” p120 by infection with pLZRS - mp120 , a retrovirus containing the murine p120 cDNA ( Fig . 1 b ) . Restoring p120 levels by expressing murine p120 reversed the effects of the h siRNA and restored adhesion ( Fig . 1 , b and c ) . It is worth noting that this method is generally applicable to any protein . If a homologous gene is not available , a knock - up construct can be generated by making silent mutations in the region targeted by the siRNA . The method is a simple in vitro equivalent of transgenic knock - out and knock - in technology , and essentially solves the common dilemma associated with ex - pressing mutant proteins in cells that already contain high lev - els of an endogenous counterpart . To our knowledge , this is the first example of this broadly applicable method . To examine the effects of p120 knockdown in detail , we isolated stable clones of A431 cells expressing p120 - specific siRNA and characterized them by Western blotting ( Fig . 1 c ) and by immunofluorescence ( Fig . 1 d ) . p120 was nearly elim - inated by h siRNA ( Fig . 1 c , lane 3 ) , but not by m siRNA ( Fig . 1 C , lane 2 ) , and p120 loss induced near complete loss of E - cadherin . Levels of (cid:3) - and (cid:4) - catenin were also severely re - duced , as expected from the fact that these catenins are stabi - lized via interaction with cadherins . Thus , p120 loss essen - tially eliminated the entire cadherin complex . Levels of vinculin , which concentrate at focal adhesions in these cells , were unaffected , as were levels of tubulin . Figure 2 . The p120 - associated destruction mechanism is common to multiple cadherins . A431 ( human cervical carcinoma ) , HUAEC , and C2C12 ( mouse myocyte ) cells express E - and P - cadherin , VE - cadherin , and N - cadherin , respectively . Each cell line was infected with either human - or murine - specific p120 siRNA retrovirus to generate polyclonal knockdown cell lines , and levels of p120 or E - , P - , VE - , and N - cadherins were assayed by Western blotting of whole - cell lysates . Tubulin levels were used as a loading control . p120 knock - down reduced expression of all these cadherins , indicating that its function is common to most ( if not all ) p120 - associated cadherins . Note that the effects of the h and m siRNAs used for knockdown and control in the human cell lines are reversed in the murine cell line C2C12 . Figure 3 . p120 levels act as a set point mechanism for determining cadherin levels . ( a ) Assay of relationship between p120 and E - cadherin levels by immuno - fluorescent staining . A431 cells express - ing p120 siRNA were infected with the murine p120 retrovirus and plated sparsely so that individual clones could emerge that expressed widely varying amounts of murine p120 . Cells were co - stained by immunofluorescence to ex - amine the p120 – E - cadherin relationship and its affect on cell – cell adhesion . p120 loss ( i ) caused complete loss of E - cadherin ( ii ) and the cells were nonadhesive . Intermediate levels of p120 expression ( panel iii ) permitted intermedi - ate levels of E - cadherin ( panel iv ) , and cell – cell adhesion was partially restored . Higher than normal levels of p120 ( panel v ) strongly induced E - cadherin ( vi ) and cell – cell adhesion was robust . These experiments reveal a direct relationship between p120 and E - cadherin levels , and the extent of cell – cell adhesion is directly affected . ( b ) Quantitative assessment of relationship between p120 and E - cadherin levels . A polyclonal population of cells expressing p120 siRNA was generated by retroviral infection . Individual clones within the population express different levels of p120 depending on integration events that affect the efficiency of the siRNA expression . Using E - cadherin antibodies ( HECD - 1 ) , the cells were separated by FACS ® into pools expressing progressively lower levels of E - cadherin . Cell lysates from the samples were split and then Western blotted with anti - p120 ( mAb pp120 ) or anti - E - cadherin ( C - 20820 ) . Th e J ou r n a l o f C e ll B i o l o gy 528 The Journal of Cell Biology | Volume 163 , Number 3 , 2003 Analysis of the p120 knockdown cells by immunofluores - cence revealed near complete loss of junctional E - cadherin , loss of (cid:3) - and (cid:4) - catenins , and loss of cell – cell adhesion ( Fig . 1 d ) . It is noteworthy that other adhesion systems ( e . g . , des - mosomes ) cannot compensate for loss of the core compo - nents of the adherens junction . These observations reveal that p120 is essential for adhesion and suggest a core func - tion for p120 in regulating cadherin turnover . The requirement for p120 is common to other cadherins To determine whether the consequence of p120 knockdown pertains only to E - cadherin , we repeated the experiments de - scribed in Fig . 1 on cells expressing E - , P - , VE - , and N - cad - herins ( Fig . 2 ) . A431 ( human cervical carcinoma ) , human umbilical aortic vascular endothelial ( HUAEC ) , and C2C12 ( murine myoblast ) cells were selected because they express E - and P - cadherin , VE - cadherin , and N - cadherin , respectively . Interestingly , the levels of each of these cadherins were sub - stantially reduced by p120 knockdown ( Fig . 2 , lanes 3 , 6 , and 9 ) . Note that because C2C12 cells are murine , the constructs are reversed relative to the human lines ; m siRNA is the knockdown construct and the h siRNA is the control . The knockdown levels in these experiments are not quite as strik - ing as in the clonal cell lines represented in Fig . 1 because they are polyclonal cell lines , and therefore represent the average siRNA expression and knockdown from multiple integration events . Nonetheless , these data indicate clearly that the mech - anism of stabilization by p120 is common to a wide variety of cadherins , probably all cadherins that bind p120 . p120 levels directly determine cadherin levels To more accurately quantify the relationship between p120 and cadherin expression , we infected A431 cells with the p120 siRNA virus and analyzed individual cell clones by coimmu - nofluorescence for p120 and E - cadherin ( unpublished data ) . We also performed the reverse experiment ( knock - up ) by in - troducing murine p120 into the h siRNA - expressing A431 cells ( Fig . 3 ) . In all cases , there was a striking correlation be - tween the levels of p120 and E - cadherin , which was also re - flected by the extent of cell – cell adhesion . In the absence of p120 , there was essentially no E - cadherin present ( Fig . 3 , i and ii ) . By contrast , intermediate levels of p120 caused inter - mediate levels of E - cadherin and partial restoration of epithe - lial morphology ( Fig . 3 , iii and iv ) . When murine p120 was expressed at higher than normal levels , E - cadherin levels were correspondingly elevated and exceeded the wild - type levels observed in the parental cell lines ( Fig . 3 , v and vi ; see also Fig . 1 c ) . Panels v and vi are overexposed because the common ex - posure time for the entire panel was chosen to allow better vi - sualization of the low and intermediate p120 levels . We also quantified the relationship between p120 and E - cadherin expression by FACS ® analysis of a population of p120 siRNA - infected cells with mAb - HECD1 , which rec - ognizes the extracellular domain of human E - cadherin ( Fig . 3 b ) . The cells were sorted into pools with progressively de - creasing levels of surface E - cadherin . Cell lysates were gen - erated from each pool , divided in half , and then Western blotted for E - cadherin and p120 ( Fig . 3 b ) . As in the immu - nofluorescent assays , the levels of p120 closely paralleled the levels of E - cadherin . Together , these data show that E - cadherin levels faithfully reflect the level of p120 expression in individual cells , and show that the levels of E - cadherin can be experimentally ti - trated by increasing or decreasing the levels of p120 . p120 family members can functionally substitute for p120 In most epithelial cell lines , p120 is abundant and its close relatives such as ARVCF and (cid:2) - catenin are poorly expressed or absent . Although p120 knockdown was sufficient to nearly eliminate E - cadherin in several epithelial cell lines tested , the effect was incomplete in cells such as the colon carcinoma cell line HCT116 . An obvious explanation is that p120 family members might partially or completely substi - tute for p120 , depending on their relative abundance . In - deed , HCT116 cells are unusual in that they express moder - ate levels of ARVCF ( unpublished data ) . To determine whether other p120 relatives can also regulate E - cadherin Figure 4 . Redundant roles for p120 family members ARVCF and (cid:2) - catenin . A431 cells stably expressing human p120 siRNA were transiently transfected with ARVCF - GFP , (cid:2) - catenin – GFP , or myc - tagged plakophilin - 3 ( Pkp - 3 - myc ) . 24 h after transfection , cells were plated sparsely and individual colonies grew for 2 d . Levels of the transfected proteins and E - cadherin were then analyzed by immuno - fluorescence . GFP expression alone ( i , eluminated cells ) did not affect E - cadherin levels ( ii ) . Both ARVCF - GFP ( iii ) and (cid:2) - catenin – GFP ( v ) substantially increased levels of E - cadherin ( iv and vi ) and rescued cell – cell adhesion . In contrast , plakophilin - 3 ( vii ) , a p120 - related protein that does not bind classical cadherins , but had no effect on E - cadherin levels ( viii ) or cell – cell adhesion . Th e J ou r n a l o f C e ll B i o l o gy p120 regulates cadherin turnover | Davis et al . 529 turnover , we transiently expressed GFP - labeled ARCVF or (cid:2) - catenin in A431 cells that lack p120 as a result of siRNA knockdown ( Fig . 4 ) . As a negative control , we also tested plakophilin - 3 , a more distant p120 relative that binds des - mosomal ( but not classical ) cadherins . A431 cells expressing p120 siRNA alone were almost completely E - cadherin nega - tive ( Fig . 4 , i and ii ) , as described earlier in this paper , and were not affected by GFP expression ( Fig . 4 i , fluorescent cells ) . ARVCF ( Fig . 4 , iii ) and (cid:2) - catenin ( Fig . 4 , v ) localized to adherens junctions and efficiently rescued adhesion by re - storing normal E - cadherin levels ( Fig . 4 , iv and vi ) . In con - trast , myc - tagged plakophilin - 3 ( Fig . 4 vii , stained cells ) did not affect cadherin levels ( Fig . 4 viii ) and failed to restore cell – cell contacts . Thus , there is a clear redundant role among close family members with regard to cadherin stabili - zation , and the occasional significant presence of a p120 family member ( e . g . , ARVCF in colon HCT116 cells ) is likely to account for the fact that E - cadherin loss does not perfectly parallel p120 loss in some cell lines . Mechanism of E - cadherin loss p120 reportedly is the first of the catenins to bind newly synthesized N - cadherin , and coprecipitates with the nascent precursor form of N - cadherin ( Wahl et al . , 2003 ) . Because of the extraordinary efficiency of E - cadherin destruction af - ter p120 knockdown , we first considered the possibility that p120 binding was necessary to stabilize E - cadherin during or after protein translation and before arrival at the cell surface . Figure 5 . p120 regulates E - cadherin turnover at the cell membrane . ( a ) E - cadherin synthesis and processing in p120 knockdown cells . E - cadherin turnover was examined by pulse - chase analysis of parental and h p120 siRNA - expressing A431 cells . (cid:3) - and (cid:4) - Catenin processing from the same experiment are shown below . Chase times are indicated across the top . At chase time 0 ( 15 min after initiation of the pulse labeling ) , E - cadherin synthesis was identical in the presence and absence of p120 ( a , compare E - cadherin bands ) . The processing of the pro - ( pro - E - cad ) and mature ( E - cad . ) forms were identical for at least 1 h . Soon thereafter , E - cadherin degradation was significantly accelerated in the absence of p120 . ( b ) Analysis of total E - cadherin surface levels in parental and p120 knockdown A431 cells . The parental and p120 knockdown A431 cells were biotinylated for 20 min at 4 (cid:5) C to label surface cadherins . To specifically measure the surface levels , E - cadherin was first immunoprecipitated directly with E - cadherin mAb HECD - 1 . The sample was eluted with 0 . 5 % SDS and then reprecipitated with streptavidin - coated beads to isolate the surface - labeled pool . E - cadherin levels at the surface in p120 knockdown cells ( lane 1 ) are at least 100 - fold diminished relative to the parental cells ( lane 2 ) . The result in lane 2 shows that the surface E - cadherin can be efficiently labeled ( and detected ) by this method . ( c ) Tracking the arrival of newly synthesized E - cadherin to the cell surface . The methods in a and b were combined to determine whether newly synthesized E - cadherin could transit to the cell surface in the absence of p120 . The results in c were quantified by densitometry and represented graphically in d . Parental and p120 knockdown ( h siRNA ) cells were labeled with [ 35 S ] methionine for 15 min , chased at 37 (cid:5) C for the times indicated across top , and placed on ice ( 4 (cid:5) C ) to suspend trafficking . Cell surface proteins were immediately biotinylated at 4 (cid:5) C for 20 min as in b . Surface E - cadherin was then isolated as in b , and the nascent [ 35 S ] methionine E - cadherin pool was visualized by SDS - PAGE and radiography . Nascent E - cadherin appeared at the surface at 30 min and peaked at 1 h . The absence of p120 had no effect on this result . Therefore , p120 is not required for E - cadherin synthesis or trafficking , but is essential to regulate E - cadherin turnover soon after its arrival at the cell surface . Th e J ou r n a l o f C e ll B i o l o gy 530 The Journal of Cell Biology | Volume 163 , Number 3 , 2003 To examine E - cadherin synthesis in the absence of p120 , we labeled the p120 knockdown A431 cells with [ 35 S ] methio - nine and performed pulse - chase experiments ( Fig . 5 a ) . In - terestingly , the rate of E - cadherin synthesis was unaffected by the absence of p120 ( Fig . 5 a , compare top panels ) . Moreover , the processing and turnover of both the precursor and mature forms of E - cadherin were identical for at least 1 h after the pulse , after which the cadherin degradation curves diverged rapidly . Degradation of (cid:3) - and (cid:4) - catenins paralleled the loss of E - cadherin , as expected from the fact that these catenins are stabilized by cadherin binding . The fact that the newly synthesized cadherin behaved identically in the presence and absence of p120 for 1 h , and until after the precursor form disappeared , suggests that cad - herin degradation occurred after arrival at the cell surface . The result was initially surprising because examination of to - tal surface levels of E - cadherin in the p120 knockdown cells ( h siRNA ) and parental cell lines ( Fig . 5 b ) showed that al - though surface E - cadherin could be efficiently isolated by bi - otin labeling and streptavidin pulldown ( e . g . , Fig . 5 b , lane 2 ) , it was (cid:2) 100 - fold less abundant in the p120 - deficient cells ( Fig . 5 b , compare lane 1 with lane 2 ) . To definitively address this issue , we combined the pulse - chase and biotin surface - labeling strategies in order to selec - tively examine the fate of the nascent E - cadherin molecules with respect to their arrival at the cell surface ( Fig . 5 c ) . The pulse labeling was conducted as in Fig . 5 a , except that sur - face E - cadherin was subsequently biotin labeled ( as in Fig . 5 b ) at each time point after the pulse chase . The surface - labeled cadherins were then isolated by streptavidin pull - down , and nascent cadherins were visualized by SDS - PAGE and autoradiography . The data show that the rate of nascent E - cadherin arrival at the cell surface is almost identical in the presence and absence of p120 ( Fig . 5 , c and d ; compare pa - rental and siRNA cell lines ) . The appearance and removal of E - cadherin from the cell surface ( Fig . 5 c ; E - cadherin (cid:6) streptavidin immunoprecipitations ) are quantified by densi - tometry and displayed graphically in Fig . 5 d . Note that peak levels of nascent ( 35 S - labeled ) E - cadherin at the cell sur - face occurred at 1 h , and by 4 h , the nascent cadherin was ei - ther moving off the surface or getting degraded . The timing is consistent with the 4 - h time point in Fig . 5 a , which marks the first interval where degradation of the unbound cadherin sharply accelerates . Clearly , E - cadherin transits normally to the surface in the absence of p120 , but is then rapidly turned over . To identify the mechanism of degradation , we treated p120 knockdown cells with over 30 agents known to inhibit factors that have been reported to affect cadherin stability and turnover . Examples include inhibitors of presenilin - 1 , caspases , metalloproteinases , and calpain . Cells were incu - bated for 24 h with predetermined amounts of the various inhibitors , and then analyzed by immunofluorescence ( un - published data ) or Western blotting for changes in levels of E - cadherin ( Fig . 6 ) . Although the majority of the inhibitors had no affect , several proteosome inhibitors ( i . e . , PS341 , lac - tacystin , and MG132 ) significantly blocked E - cadherin deg - radation ( Fig . 6 ; lactacystin , lanes 1 and 2 ; PS341 , lanes 3 and 4 ) . The reduced amount of E - cadherin at the higher PS341 dose ( Fig . 6 , compare lane 3 with lane 4 ) reflects tox - icity of this compound . Of the two commonly used lysoso - mal inhibitors we tried , ammonium chloride ( Fig . 6 , lane 5 ; NH 4 Cl ) had no effect , but chloroquine ( Fig . 6 , lane 6 ; Chl ) blocked E - cadherin degradation almost as effectively as the proteosome inhibitors . In both the PS341 - and chloroquine - treated cells , cytoplasmic pools of E - cadherin increased , but the increased levels were not reflected by increased adhesion or higher surface cadherin levels . Thus , these inhibitors ap - pear to block cadherin degradation , but do not affect inter - nalization . The data suggest that when newly synthesized E - cadherin arrives at the cell surface , p120 is required to prevent the immediate targeting of unbound E - cadherin for degradation by the proteosome and / or lysosome . We con - clude that p120 regulates cadherin turnover by controlling either internalization , or possibly an immediately subse - quent decision whereby internalized cadherins are sorted into recycling or degradation pathways . Discussion Here , we provide evidence that the core function of p120 in cadherin complexes is to regulate cadherin turnover . Pre - viously , we showed that the stabilizing effect of p120 on E - cadherin in a p120 - deficient SW48 cell line involved a post - transcriptional mechanism and required direct p120 – E - cadherin interaction ( Ireton et al . , 2002 ) . However , it was not clear whether this phenomenon was generally applicable beyond SW48 cells , nor could we determine the underlying mechanism . Here , using siRNA and / or p120 reconstitution , we show that E - cadherin levels depend absolutely on p120 expression . Importantly , this set point mechanism is com - mon to other ( probably all ) p120 - binding cadherins because p120 knockdown also induced significant down - regulation Figure 6 . Mechanism of E - cadherin degradation . The effects of various inhibitors known to influence cadherin stability were assayed in the stable p120 knockdown A431 cells . E - cadherin levels from samples treated for 24 h ( lanes 1 – 9 ) were monitored by Western blotting whole - cell lysates and were compared with normal E - cadherin levels in the parental cell line ( lane 10 ) . Inhibitor concentrations were as follows : lactacystin 10 (cid:7) M ( lane 1 ) , 3 . 3 (cid:7) M ( lane 2 ) ; PS341 100 nM ( lane 3 ) , 33 nM ( lane 4 ) , ammonium chloride 5 mM ( lane 5 ) , Chloroquine 33 (cid:7) M ( lane 6 ) , and IETD - CHO 10 nM ( lane 7 ) . DMSO is the control condition ( lane 8 ) . The proteosome inhibitors lactacystin and PS341 increased E - cadherin levels ( compare lanes 1 – 4 to lanes 8 and 9 ) . The lower cadherin levels after 100 nM PS341 ( lane 3 ) relative to the 33 - nM treatment ( lane 4 ) is due to toxicity at the higher concentration . Of the lysosomal inhibitors , chloroquine ( lane 6 ) , but not ammonium chloride ( lane 5 ) , increased E - cadherin levels . A caspase 8 inhibitor ( lane 7 ) that has been shown to inhibit E - cadherin degradation in myeloma cells had no effect . Th e J ou r n a l o f C e ll B i o l o gy p120 regulates cadherin turnover | Davis et al . 531 of P - , VE - , and N - cadherins . The timing and location of p120 action argue strongly that p120 regulates adhesion via controlling cadherin turnover at the cell surface . These ob - servations have crucial implications for roles of p120 in cad - herin function and cancer . We believe that the only exception to the requirement for p120 occurs in cells that express p120 family members such as ARVCF or (cid:2) - catenin . This qualifier is based in part on cell lines such as HCT116 where the observed reduction in E - cadherin levels after p120 siRNA expression did not per - fectly parallel the extent of p120 loss . Indeed , although ARVCF is typically difficult to detect in many epithelial cell lines , it is expressed at moderate levels in HCT116 cells ( un - published data ) . Our data show that ARVCF and (cid:2) - catenin efficiently compensate for p120 loss when ectopically ex - pressed in A431 cell lines expressing p120 siRNA . Despite significant structural and sequence similarity , plakophilin - 3 had no effect , presumably because it does not bind classical cadherins . These data strongly imply that surface cadherin stability is invariably dependent on the binding of either p120 or a closely related family member , and the presence of variable levels of p120 family members likely accounts for the discrepancy in cell lines where p120 knockdown does not cause a corresponding loss of resident classical cadherins . The fact that p120 availability limits cadherin levels has sev - eral crucial implications . For example , overexpression of dom - inant - negative cadherins frequently down - regulates expression of endogenous cadherins ( Kintner , 1992 ; Fujimori and Ta - keichi , 1993 ; Zhu and Watt , 1996 ) , but the mechanism is un - known . Our data strongly suggest that a key action of domi - nant - negative cadherins is the sequestering of endogenous p120 , thereby driving the turnover and degradation of endog - enous cadherins . In addition , cadherin levels in cells may ulti - mately be controlled by factors that regulate p120 levels , and competition for interaction with p120 is likely to be physio - logically relevant in cells that express more than one cadherin . In theory , the absence of cadherins in p120 - deficient cells indicates either a failure to normally synthesize cadherins or an efficient means of eliminating them when p120 is not present . However , our pulse - chase data indicate that p120 is not required for normal synthesis or transit of cadherin to the cell surface . Instead , p120 absence dramatically accelerates cadherin degradation after its arrival at the surface , indicating a role in regulating cadherin turnover at the membrane ( modeled in Fig . 7 ) . Our data do not precisely distinguish the point at which p120 acts to prevent degradation . The sim - plest explanation is that p120 limits degradation by regulat - ing internalization . Only cadherin - bound p120 is phosphor - ylated ( Thoreson et al . , 2000 ) , and p120 phosphorylation is the most likely means of regulating p120 – cadherin affinity and / or p120 activity in the complex . We cannot rule out the less likely possibility that once internalized , p120 might con - trol the next step , which targets the endocytosed cadherin for either degradation or recycling back to the surface . Regard - less , it is likely that the ultimate destruction of the cadherin in p120 - deficient A431 cells resides mainly in the proteo - some , and to some extent in the lysosome . Under normal circumstances , cadherin turnover is consti - tutive and endocytosis is a crucial mechanism for down - reg - ulating cadherin adhesiveness ( Le et al . , 1999 , 2002 ; Xiao et al . , 2003 ) . Previously , we postulated that p120 acts as a switch , inducing the assembly or disassembly of cadherin complexes through transient signaling events ( probably tyro - sine and serine phosphorylation ) , which in turn might regu - late cadherin clustering . Our new data strongly favor a mechanism whereby dynamic assembly and disassembly of cadherin complexes is driven primarily by regulation of cad - herin turnover rather than physical clustering ( Fig . 7 ) . A plausible explanation is that the rate of cadherin turnover is dictated by events at the cell surface that transiently increase or decrease p120 affinity for cadherins . The off state favors internalization / degradation , whereas the on state favors re - tention / recycling . The low affinity of p120 for cadherins , as judged by coimmunoprecipitation experiments ( Thoreson et al . , 2000 ) , probably reflects the ability of p120 to rapidly al - ternate between cadherin - bound and - unbound states . It is worth noting that (cid:3) - and (cid:4) - catenins are largely passive play - Figure 7 . Model for p120 function in regulating cadherin turnover . The low affinity of p120 for cadherins , as judged by coimmunopre - cipitation experiments , probably reflects the ability of p120 to rapidly alternate between cadherin - bound and - unbound states . ( 1 ) Our data suggest that the rate of cadherin turnover is controlled by cell surface events that transiently increase or decrease p120 affinity for cadherins . Thus , cadherin complexes exist in a dynamic equilibrium between p120 - bound and - unbound states , which in turn may be regulated by p120 phosphorylation ( not depicted ) . ( 2 ) Unbound cadherin is targeted for internalization , possibly via a Hakai - like ubiquitination mechanism ( see Discussion ) . ( 3 ) We cannot yet rule out an alternative pathway where p120 binding is irrelevant for internalization , but mediates a sorting decision that recycles internalized cadherin back to the membrane . ( 4 ) Regardless of the exact decision point , unbound cadherin is targeted for degradation by the proteosome and / or lysosome . Considerable evidence indicates that signaling events at the cell surface modulate phosphorylation of the cadherin - bound pool of p120 . The simplest interpretation of these observations is that p120 phosphorylation regulates its steady - state affinity for cadherins , which in turn regulates adhesion by controlling the rate of cadherin turnover . Note that (cid:3) - and (cid:4) - catenin are passive players in this model . They likely participate in clustering and certainly mediate the cytoskeletal interaction ( not depicted ) , but their role may be secondary to regulating surface cadherin levels , which is almost completely determined by p120 . Th e J ou r n a l o f C e ll B i o l o gy 532 The Journal of Cell Biology | Volume 163 , Number 3 , 2003 ers in this model . Because their stability is controlled by cad - herin binding , their fate is ultimately tied to cadherin levels , which are clearly controlled by p120 . Of course , turnover and clustering are not mutually exclusive mechanisms , but our current data suggest that turnover may take precedence . Recent experiments in C . elegans and Drosophila indicate that p120 is not essential in these organisms . Indeed , both worms ( Pettitt et al . , 2003 ) and flies ( Myster et al . , 2003 ) are viable when p120 is removed , and p120 - uncoupled E - cad - herin can substitute effectively for wild - type E - cadherin in flies ( Pacquelet et al . , 2003 ) . In contrast , the murine p120 knockout is embryonic lethal ( unpublished data ) . Addition - ally , our current data show clearly that p120 is essential in mammalian cells . It is possible that mammalian p120 has evolved both additional family members and increased com - plexity to accommodate the developmental demands of higher organisms . An unanswered question is the exact targeting mechanism for internalization and / or degradation of cadherins not asso - ciated with p120 . Because direct binding of p120 to E - cad - herin is required , it is possible that p120 binding blocks the interaction of an unknown binding partner ( or event ) that targets E - cadherin for degradation . Candidates include pres - enilin - 1 ( Baki et al . , 2001 ; Marambaud et al . , 2002 ) and Hakai ( Fujita et al . , 2002 ) , which are reported to compete with p120 for binding the cadherin juxtamembrane domain . Presenilin - 1 binding promotes proteolytic degradation of E - cadherin ( Baki et al . , 2001 ; Marambaud et al . , 2002 ) , whereas Hakai is a ubiquitin ligase that binds tyrosine - phos - phorylated E - cadherin , leading to its ubiquitination and de - struction ( Fujita et al . , 2002 ) . Several tyrosine kinase recep - tors are turned over via a similar mechanism involving the oncogene and ubiquitin ligase Cbl , which binds tyrosine - phosphorylated residues via its classical SH2 domain ( for re - view see Hicke , 1999 ) . However , we were unable to block E - cadherin destruction in the p120 siRNA cell lines with ei - ther presenilin or tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( unpublished data ) . Moreover , the mechanism we describe is common to several cadherins , whereas the Hakai mechanism appears specific for E - cadherin . Nonetheless , our data favor a model where an E - cadherin – targeting event is triggered by the ab - sence or transient off - loading of p120 . Finally , several lines of evidence suggest that this new role for p120 in regulating cadherin turnover may be important in cancer . In cell lines , E - cadherin loss leaves p120 stranded in the cytoplasm , but has little effect on p120 levels . It is well es - tablished that E - cadherin loss occurs frequently by mutation ( Berx et al . , 1998 ) and by epigenetic mechanisms ( Comijn et al . , 2001 ; Matsumura et al . , 2001 ) that probably do not in - volve p120 . In contrast , p120 loss clearly represents a different scenario that directly induces loss of E - cadherin , and thus ulti - mately , the entire cadherin complex . It follows that p120 loss may precede cadherin loss in the reported subset of tumors that have been shown to lack both proteins ( for review see Thoreson and Reynolds , 2002 ) . Accumulating evidence sug - gests that p120 down - regulation occurs frequently in colon , prostate , lung , bladder , breast , and several other malignancies ( for review see Thoreson and Reynolds , 2002 ) . p120 is both mutated and underexpressed in the colon carcinoma cell line SW48 , and indeed , E - cadherin is indeed strongly down - regu - lated in these cells , providing the first physiologically relevant example of this phenomena in a carcinoma cell line . However , no other p120 - deficient cell lines have been described , and physical alterations in the p120 gene locus have not been asso - ciated with malignancy . Together , these observations suggest that p120 down - regulation in tumors occurs by an epigenetic mechanism that has yet to be identified , and raise the possibil - ity that like E - cadherin , p120 acts as a tumor suppressor . In conclusion , we show that p120 levels determine steady - state levels of functional cadherins by regulating cadherin turnover at the cell surface . This is likely the core function of p120 in the cadherin complex and suggests that cadherin adhesiveness is modulated , in part , by signaling events that dynamically influence p120 – cadherin affinity . In addition , p120 is clearly at the top of the cadherin food chain in terms of who controls the overall fate of the com - plex . Together with reports of p120 down - regulation in a wide range of epithelial tumors , these data suggest a role for p120 as a tumor suppressor . Materials and methods Cell culture , infections , and transfections HUAECs ( CC - 2535 ; Cambrex ) were thawed at passage one . They were grown in endothelial basal medium ( CC - 3121 ; Cambrex ) supplemented with EGM SingleQuots ® supplements and growth factors ( CC - 4133 ; Cam - brex ) . Just before use , HUAEC culture dishes were treated with 0 . 2 % gela - tin ( Sigma - Aldrich , G1393 ) in PBS for 20 min at 37 (cid:5) C . Culture conditions for Phoenix cells have been described previously ( Ireton et al . , 2002 ) , and all other cell lines were cultured as described elsewhere ( Anastasiadis et al . , 2000 ) . For siRNA expression , cells were infected with pRS and se - lected with 3 to 5 (cid:7) g / ml puromycin . As indicated , some cells were in - fected again with LZRS – mp120 – neomycin and selected with 600 (cid:7) g / ml neomycin . pRS and LZRS retroviruses were produced in the Phoenix cell packaging line as described previously ( Ireton et al . , 2002 ) . Clonal A431 cell lines were subcloned by limiting dilution . p120 expression was as - sessed by immunofluorescence and Western blotting . Transient transfec - tions were performed with LipofectAMINE™ 2000 ( Invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Immunofluorescence and FACS ® Cells were plated sparsely on glass coverslips and incubated for 2 d before immunofluorescent labeling . Cells were washed once with PBS , then fixed in 3 % PFA for 30 min . Fixed cells were washed with PBS / 10 mM glycine twice and permeabilized in 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 / PBS for 5 min . Cells were again washed in PBS / 10 mM glycine and blocked in 3 % milk / PBS before staining . Primary antibodies mAb pp120 ( Transduction Laboratories ) , anti - (cid:4) - catenin C - 2206 ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , anti - (cid:3) - catenin C - 2081 ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , anti - E - cadherin C - 20820 ( Transduction Laboratories ) , and HECD - 1 ( a gift from Masatoshi Takeichi , Kyoto University , Kyoto , Japan ) were used as de - scribed previously ( Ireton et al . , 2002 ) . Other primary antibodies were used as follows : anti - tubulin ( DM1a ; Sigma - Aldrich ) 1 : 1000 , anti - vinculin ( hvin - 1 ; Sigma - Aldrich ) 1 : 400 , anti - myc ( mAb 9E10 ) 1 (cid:7) g / ml , and SHE78 – 7 anti E - cadherin ( Zymed Laboratories ) 1 (cid:7) g / ml . Secondary antibodies goat anti – mouse IgG1 and IgG2a conjugated either to Alexa ® 594 or 488 were used at 1 . 7 (cid:7) g / ml . Cells were mounted in ProLong Antifade ( Molecular Probes , Inc . ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and were visual - ized on a microscope ( Axioplan 2 ; Carl Zeiss MicroImaging , Inc . ) with Im - mersol 518F oil ( Carl Zeiss MicroImaging , Inc . ) using a 63 (cid:8) Plan Apochro - mat 1 . 4 aperture objective lens ( Carl Zeiss MicroImaging , Inc . ) . Pictures were acquired using a camera ( Orca - ER ; Hamamatsu ) and Openlab v3 . 1 . 4 software ( Improvision ) . To isolate pools of cells expressing different levels of E - cadherin , a p120 siRNA - infected A431 cell population was sorted by FACS ® as follows : cells were dissociated with GIBCO BRL cell dissociation buffer ( enzyme free , PBS based ) at 37 (cid:5) C for 45 min . Single - cell suspensions were enhanced by repeated pipetting , washed in PBS containing 1 % serum , and then labeled with E - cadherin mAb HECD1 ( 10 (cid:7) g for 5 (cid:8) 10 6 cells in 1 ml ) , followed by washing and then additional labeling with the secondary antibody Alexa ® 488 – conjugated goat anti – mouse IgG ( 1 / 1 , 000 dilution in 1 ml ; Molecular Th e J ou r n a l o f C e ll B i o l o gy p120 regulates cadherin turnover | Davis et al . 533 Probes , Inc . ) . After washing , cells were labeled with 7AAD ( Molecular Probes , Inc . ) to discriminate dead cells , and subjected to FACS ® using a FACStar PLUS™ cell sorter ( Becton Dickinson ) . All procedures were per - formed at 4 (cid:5) C to prevent E - cadherin endocytosis . Four gates were set based on preliminary experiments designed to separate cells into four cate - gories of cells expressing high to low levels of E - cadherin . The resulting pools were expanded and then analyzed by Western blotting for p120 and E - cadherin levels . Pulse chase , biotinylation , and cell surface trafficking Pulse - chase experiments were performed exactly as described previously ( Ireton et al . , 2002 ) . Biotinylation and the rate of cell surface trafficking were also performed exactly as described previously ( Bonifacino et al . , 2003 ) . In brief , cells were plated at 5 (cid:8) 10 5 cells per 60 - mm dish for 36 h before pulse chase . Cells were 35 S - labeled for 15 min before chase . At the end of the chase , cell surface proteins were labeled with 1 mg / ml EZ - Link sulfo - NHS - SS - biotin ( Pierce Chemical Co . ) at 4 (cid:5) C for 30 min . E - cadherin was immunoprecipitated from NP - 40 cell lysates , and surface cadherin was detected by dividing the E - cadherin immunoprecipitations in half , eluting E - cadherin from the beads with 0 . 5 % SDS , reconstituting elutions in 50 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) , and pulling down biotinylated E - cadherin with 10 (cid:7) l per sample of packed streptavidin - coated agarose beads ( Sigma - Aldrich ) for 1 h at 4 (cid:5) C . Samples were washed three times with 50 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) , and protein was eluted with 2 (cid:8) Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by SDS - PAGE and autoradiography as described pre - viously ( Ireton et al . , 2002 ) . Quantification was performed by densitometry using Image Gage software ( Fujifilm Inc . ) . Arbitrary densitometry units were plotted with GraphPad Prism ( GraphPad Software , Inc . ) and adjusted for background . Biotinylation of total surface cadherin was performed as described above , but without the pulse - chase labeling . Constructs LZRS – mp120 – Neo has been described in detail previously ( Ireton et al . , 2002 ) . The pRS vector was a gift from Reuven Agami ( The Netherlands Cancer Institute , Amsterdam , Netherlands ) . pRS human p120 siRNA and pRS m siRNA were generated according to Brummelkamp et al . ( 2002 ) . In brief , a 64 - bp linker was inserted into pRS using the BamHI and HindIII sites . Oligos for the linker contained p120 - specific sense and correspond - ing antisense sequences , flanking a 6 - base hairpin , and were PAGE puri - fied by Integrated DNA Technologies . pEGFP - C1 (cid:2) - catenin ( Lu et al . , 1999 ) was a gift from Qun Lu ( East Carolina University , Greenville , NC ) . pEGFP - C2 ARVCF C11 ( Waibler et al . , 2001 ) was a gift from Anna Starzin - ski - Powitz ( Johann Wolfgang Goethe - Universität , Frankfurt , Germany ) . pEGFP - C1 ( CLONTECH Laboratories , Inc . ) was used as a negative control in transfection experiments . Western blotting Western blotting procedures were conducted as described by Mariner et al . ( 2001 ) . In brief , cells were grown to confluence and lysed with either NP - 40 or RIPA buffer . Protein concentrations in lysates were obtained by copper reduction / bicinchoninic acid ( BCA ) assay ( Pierce Chemical Co . ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Primary antibodies were used as follows : mAb pp120 ( 0 . 1 (cid:7) g / ml ) , anti - E - cadherin mAbs C - 20820 ( 1 / 2 , 500 ) and HECD - 1 ( 0 . 1 (cid:7) g / ml ) , anti - (cid:4) - catenin pAb C - 2206 ( 1 / 5 , 000 ; Sigma - Aldrich ) , and anti - (cid:3) - catenin pAb C - 2081 ( 1 / 5 , 000 ; Sigma - Aldrich ) . Secondary antibodies were peroxidase - conjugated donkey anti – mouse IgG ( 1 / 10 , 000 ; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories ) and mouse anti – rabbit IgG ( 1 / 10 , 000 ; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories ) . Anti - tubulin ( DM1a ; Sigma - Aldrich ) and anti - vinculin ( hvin - 1 ; Sigma - Aldrich ) were used at 1 : 1 , 000 and 1 : 400 , respectively . Inhibitors Cells were plated at 5 (cid:8) 10 5 cells per 60 - mm dish for 36 h before treat - ment with inhibitors . Inhibitors were added to standard growth media at the following concentrations : 33 nM PS341 ( Millenium Pharmaceuticals ) , 3 . 3 (cid:7) M lactacystin ( Calbiochem ) , 33 (cid:7) M chloroquine ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , 5 mM ammonium chloride ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , and 10 nM IETD - CHO ( Calbio - chem ) .
