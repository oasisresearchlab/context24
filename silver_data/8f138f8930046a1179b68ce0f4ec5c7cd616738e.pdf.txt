However , the widely used methods to characterize phase separation proteins are still based on low - throughput experiments , which con - sume time and could not be used to explore protein LLPS properties in bulk . Results By combining gradient 1 , 6 - hexanediol ( 1 , 6 - HD ) elution and quantitative proteomics , we developed chro - matin enriching hexanediol separation coupled with liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry ( CHS - MS ) to explore the LLPS properties of different chromatin - associated proteins ( CAPs ) .

BMC Genomics ( 2023 ) 24 : 493 Background The formation of membraneless organelles by liquid – liq - uid phase separation ( LLPS ) is a novel biological concept with fast - growing attention [ 1 ] . Multiple chromatin - associated proteins ( CAPs ) forming nuclear condensates through LLPS involve in regulating vital biological pro - cesses . For example , heterochromatin protein 1α ( HP1α ) is critical in forming heterochromatin domains in the nucleus [ 2 , 3 ] . In addition , condensate formation of RNA Pol II and several transcription factors ( TFs ) and tran - scription cofactors ( TCs ) are critical for gene regulation [ 4 – 8 ] . Therefore , investigating LLPS properties of CAPs assists in elucidating phase separation processes regulat - ing chromatin - associated biological processes . Several in vivo and in vitro low - throughput experimental meth - ods are available to characterize LLPS proteins , includ - ing immunofluorescence , droplet roundness / fusion , and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching [ 9 ] . However , these methods are time - consuming , and cannot identify LLPS proteins in large scale . In addition , the formation of biomolecular condensate is related to the microenvi - ronment that surrounds the condensate . However , these methods neglect physiological conditions . Given the complexity and difficulty of low - throughput experimen - tal identification of LLPS proteins under physiological conditions , an efficient high - throughput experiment is urgently required to investigate the LLPS properties of CAPs . 1 , 6 - Hexanediol ( 1 , 6 - HD ) is an aliphatic alcohol that interferes with hydrophobic interactions and is com - monly used in vivo and in vitro to disassemble LLPS - dependent biomolecular condensates [ 10 , 11 ] . 1 , 6 - HD interferes not only with hydrophobic interactions between proteins but also with hydrophobic interactions between proteins and nucleic acids , which are required for the formation of LLPS - dependent biomolecular con - densates [ 12 ] . A previous study has shown that after treating MCF7 cells with 1 , 6 - HD , different proteins exhibited varying degrees of decrease in ChIP - seq sig - nals [ 6 ] . This finding suggested different proteins vary in 1 , 6 - HD sensitivity , resulting in different chromatin bind - ing abilities of proteins . This protein - specific sensitivity to 1 , 6 - HD provides a valuable opportunity to investigate the LLPS properties of CAPs in bulk under physiological conditions . Previously , we reported a new high - through - put experimental method called Hi - MS combining 10 % 1 , 6 - HD treatment , and found that CAPs have varying 1 , 6 - HD sensitivities , thus reflecting their abilities to bind DNA [ 13 ] . However , there are a few limitations regard - ing Hi - MS : 1 ) it is complex and time consuming and 2 ) it only uses one single - concentration for 1 , 6 - HD treat - ment , although we noticed that CAPs showed differ - ent sensitivities to different concentrations of 1 , 6 - HD [ 13 ] . Considering that several studies have applied dif - ferent concentrations of 1 , 6 - HD to disrupt a variety of biomolecular condensates [ 7 , 14 , 15 ] , we believe that applying different concentrations of 1 , 6 - HD can assist in better understanding of the LLPS properties of CAPs . Therefore , we need to develop convenient and less time - consuming high - throughput experimental methods to investigate the sensitivity of proteins to different concen - trations of 1 , 6 - HD treatment . In this work , we developed a high - throughput experi - mental method called chromatin enriching hexanediol separation coupled with liquid chromatography mass spectrometry ( CHS - MS ) using gradient 1 , 6 - HD elution . CHS - MS could effectively enrich CAPs prone to LLPS . Combining gradient 1 , 6 - HD treatment , we explored the sensitivity of CAPs to 1 , 6 - HD with different concentra - tions and further examined the physicochemical charac - teristics of these CAPs . Results CHS‑MS effectively captures chromatin‑associated proteins In order to explore the LLPS properties of CAPs , we developed a method to capture CAPs ( Fig . 1A ) . To avoid the interference of background proteins , we treated K562 cells with isotonic buffer ( IB ) to remove proteins in the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm . Subsequently , to investigate the sensitivity of proteins to different concentrations of 1 , 6 - HD , we performed gradient elution to enrich proteins eluted under different conditions ( 2 % , 5 % , and 10 % 1 , 6 - HD ) . Finally , we obtained the abundance of proteins in each treatment group with label - free quantitative mass spectrometry ( MS ) . We named this method chroma - tin enriching hexanediol separation coupled with liquid chromatography mass spectrometry ( CHS - MS ) ( Fig . 1A ) . Using this approach , we captured 2 , 522 ( IB ) , 1 , 613 ( 2 % 1 , 6 - HD ) , 1 , 544 ( 5 % 1 , 6 - HD ) and 1 , 638 proteins ( 10 % 1 , 6 - HD ) respectively ( Additional file 1 : Figure S1A , Addi - tional file 2 : Table S1 ) . The 1 , 6 - HD treatment group and the IB treatment group had 1 , 621 overlapping proteins ( Additional file 1 : Figure S1B ) . We analysed the types of proteins enriched in IB and 1 , 6 - HD treatment , and found that 1 , 6 - HD treatment enriched more TFs , TCs , and RNA binding proteins ( RBPs ) ( Fig . 1B ) . In addition , we performed Gene Ontology ( GO ) enrichment analy - sis of the captured proteins in the 1 , 6 - HD and IB treat - ment groups . As shown in Fig . 1C and Additional file 3 : Table S2 , GO terms localized in the nucleus , e . g . nucleo - lus , spliceosomal complex , nuclear speckle , and chro - matin , were more enriched in 1 , 6 - HD treatment group , while GO terms localized in the cytoplasm , e . g . ribosome and mitochondrion , were more enriched in IB treatment group . Page 3 of 11 Zhu et al . BMC Genomics ( 2023 ) 24 : 493 Taken together , these results suggested that our experi - mental procedure could effectively enrich CAPs . 1 , 6‑HD‑eluted proteins are prone to LLPS To elucidate the abundance distribution of known phase separation proteins in different treatment groups , we analysed 272 known phase separation proteins from PhaSepDB [ 16 ] and found that the 1 , 6 - HD treatment group enriched greater abundance of these known phase separation proteins than the IB treatment group ( Fig . 2A ) . In addition , OpenCell [ 17 ] provided extensive protein imaging data . We found that the 1 , 6 - HD treat - ment group enriched higher abundance of nuclear puncta proteins than the IB treatment group ( Fig . 2A ) . Hi - MS provided an anti - 1 , 6 - HD index of chromatin - associated proteins ( AICAP ) [ 13 ] . We found that 1 , 6 - HD treatment group enriched higher abundance of AICAP < 0 . 5 pro - teins than the IB treatment group ( Fig . 2A ) . Next , we also investigated the enrichment of various biomolecular con - densates - associated proteins from PhaSepDB in different treatment groups . As shown in Fig . 2B and Additional file 4 : Figure S2 , the 1 , 6 - HD treatment group enriched higher abundance of proteins related to chromatin - asso - ciated condensates ( nuclear speckle , spliceosome , par - aspeckle and nuclear body ) , whereas the IB treatment group enriched higher abundance of proteins related to biomolecular condensates closely associated with cyto - plasm ( nucleolus , nuclear pore complex , and nuclear stress body ) [ 18 ] . Previous studies have revealed a number of LLPS - related sequence features [ 1 , 19 – 21 ] , most of which involve multivalent interactions . In brief , multivalent interactions could be mediated by intrinsically disor - dered regions ( IDRs ) or low complexity domains ( LCDs ) . Therefore , we analysed the sequence characteristics of the enriched proteins in different treatment groups . We found that the high - abundance proteins in the 1 , 6 - HD treatment group contained a high proportion of IDR or LCD regions compared with the low abundance proteins , whereas the trend in the IB treatment group was opposite Fig . 1 CHS - MS effectively enriches chromatin - associated proteins .

BMC Genomics ( 2023 ) 24 : 493 ( Fig . 3 ) , indicating that 1 , 6 - HD treatment could specifi - cally enrich proteins with high proportion of disordered regions . In addition , many computational approaches have been developed to predict protein’s probability to undergo LLPS [ 22 ] . PScore was developed on the basis of pi – pi interaction frequency to screen LLPS proteins [ 23 ] . catGRANULE was initially trained to predict inap - propriate liquid phase separation on the basis of yeast proteome [ 24 ] . PhaSePred provides self - assembling and partner - dependent phase - separating protein prediction Fig . 2 Enrichment of proteins in biomolecular condensates .

BMC Genomics ( 2023 ) 24 : 493 [ 25 ] . Hence , to further explore the phase separation characteristics of the enriched proteins in the 1 , 6 - HD treatment group , we compared the phase separation pre - diction scores of the enriched proteins in different groups ( Fig . 3 ) . The high - abundance proteins in the 1 , 6 - HD treatment group exhibited higher phase separation scores in all four phase separation protein predictors ( PScore , SaPS , PdPS , and catGRANULE ) than the low - abundance proteins . By contrast , the enriched proteins in the IB treatment group showed lower phase separation scores in all four predictors . Among them , SaPS and PdPS pre - dicted the likelihood of self - assembled phase separation proteins and interaction - dependent phase separation proteins , respectively , indicating that 1 , 6 - HD treatment could enrich these two types of phase separation proteins well ( Fig . 3 ) . To further support our argument , we com - pared it with previously published gradient salt extrac - tion experiments [ 26 ] , and found proteins enriched in 1 , 6 - HD treatment were prone to LLPS compared with salt treatment ( Additional file 5 : Figure S3 ) . These results suggest that 1 , 6 - HD treatment could specifically disrupt the biomolecular condensates in the nucleus and thus enrich proteins prone to LLPS . Different gradients of 1 , 6‑HD capture proteins with diverse physicochemical properties To investigate the differences in protein sensitivity towards different gradients of 1 , 6 - HD , we analysed the abundance and physiochemical properties of enriched proteins eluted by different concentrations of 1 , 6 - HD . Because the nucleolus consists of multiple layers in its structure , we speculate that different concentrations of 1 , 6 - HD have different influences on each layer . We clas - sified nucleolus rim proteins ( rim ) and nucleolus interior proteins ( nuc ) with subcellular localization information provided by HPA . Then , we analysed their enrichment in treatment groups with different 1 , 6 - HD concentra - tions . We found that a lower concentration of 1 , 6 - HD ( 2 % ) enriched higher abundance of rim proteins while a higher concentration ( 10 % ) enriched higher abundance of nuc proteins ( Fig . 4A ) . This indicates that the dis - ruption ability of 1 , 6 - HD on biomolecular condensates gradually increased with the increase of 1 , 6 - HD concen - tration , which also further verified the effectiveness of different 1 , 6 - HD concentration treatments in CHS - MS experiments . To further explore the characteristics of the enriched proteins in different 1 , 6 - HD treatment groups , we defined the proteins captured in each concentration treatment group with abundance exceeding 50 % of the total abun - dance of all concentration treatment groups as represent - ative proteins for this concentration ( Fig . 4B , Additional file 6 : Figure S4 ) . We performed GO enrichment analysis on all representative proteins , and found that 2 % 1 , 6 - HD treatment group enriched transcription - related complex ( transcription factor complex and mediator complex ) , and 10 % 1 , 6 - HD treatment group enriched splicing - associated complex and chromatin remodeling complex ( nuclear speckle , spliceosomal complex , and SWI / SNF complex ) , while 5 % 1 , 6 - HD treatment group enriched mitochondrion - associated complex ( mitochondrial inner membrane and mitochondrial respiratory chain complex Fig . 3 Analysis of known sequence features related to phase separation and phase separation prediction scores . IDR and LCD scores are their respective ratios to the full length of the protein . P - value was calculated using Mann – Whitney rank sum test . IDR , intrinsically disorder region ; LCD , low complexity domain Page 6 of 11 Zhu et al . BMC Genomics ( 2023 ) 24 : 493 I ) ( Fig . 4C ) . These results suggested that transcription - related complexes were sensitive to 2 % 1 , 6 - HD treat - ment , and splicing - related complexes were sensitive to 10 % 1 , 6 - HD treatment . In addition , we also defined the proteins with abundance share between 20 and 50 % as common proteins ( Additional file 7 : Table S3 ) and found that the common proteins were mostly components of cytoplasmic localization ( Additional file 8 : Table S4 ) . We further analysed the sequence characteristics of all representative proteins , and found the representative proteins in the 2 % 1 , 6 - HD treatment group contained a higher proportion of IDR and LCD regions compared to the higher concentration treatment groups ( Fig . 5A ) . These results indicate that the enriched proteins in the 2 % 1 , 6 - HD treatment group may rely mainly on IDR and LCD to maintain hydrophobic interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids , and are most sensitive to the 1 , 6 - HD treatment . In addition , we found that the ratio of hydrophobic amino acids and charged amino acids also differed between the representative proteins in the dif - ferent concentration treatment groups . Briefly , the rep - resentative proteins in the 2 % 1 , 6 - HD treatment group contain the lowest ratio of hydrophobic amino acids and the highest ratio of charged amino acids , suggesting that proteins containing fewer hydrophobic amino acids are more sensitive to 1 , 6 - HD treatment ( Fig . 5A ) . This result is consistent with previous findings [ 27 – 30 ] that 1 , 6 - HD interferes with weak hydrophobic protein – protein Fig . 4 Representative proteins enriched by different gradients of 1 , 6 - HD treatment .

BMC Genomics ( 2023 ) 24 : 493 or protein - RNA interactions that are required for these dynamic , liquid - like assemblies to form . We also per - formed InterPro enrichment analysis of all representative proteins , and found that 10 % treatment group enriched more nucleotide - binding and structural domains ( Nucle - otide - binding alpha – beta plait , RNA recognition motif domain , and WD40 repeat ) than 2 % and 5 % treatment groups ( Fig . 5B , Additional file 9 : Table S5 ) . In summary , CHS - MS captured representative proteins sensitive to different concentrations of 1 , 6 - HD , and these proteins have different physicochemical properties . Discussion Enriching CAPs has always been a heated research area . MS - based proteomics could be used to measure system - level protein dynamics and help collect CAPs in large scale , but capturing CAPs , especially those involved in nuclear condensates through LLPS , is challenging . Many chromatin proteins are expressed transiently at low levels or are difficult to extract from the nucleus [ 31 – 33 ] . Pre - vious experimental approaches enriching CAPs are com - prehensive and failed to detect most expressed TFs and TCs [ 34 – 39 ] . In the present research , we combined strict isotonic solution elution and gradient 1 , 6 - HD treatment to partially solve this restriction . The 1 , 6 - HD treatment enriched more TFs , TCs and RBPs than the IB treatment . These results indicated that our newly - developed method CHS - MS could effectively enrich CAPs , which helps fur - ther elucidate their LLPS properties . Developing a systematic experimental methodology to identify and characterize biomolecular condensates and the LLPS properties of their components is crucial for further development of the LLPS field . In this study , CHS - MS combines quantitative proteomics and gradi - ent 1 , 6 - HD elution to investigate the LLPS properties of CAPs . CHS - MS is a simple and easy - to - operate method for rapid enrichment of CAPs prone to LLPS . And gra - dient 1 , 6 - HD elution could assist in exploring the prop - erties of proteins with different sensitivities towards different concentrations of 1 , 6 - HD . We found that tran - scription - related complexes were sensitive to 2 % 1 , 6 - HD treatment and the representative proteins of 2 % 1 , 6 - HD treatment had the highest percentage of IDRs and LCDs . Previous studies have also shown TFs and TCs have high percentages of IDRs and can form transcription - related condensates . In addition , the splicing - related complexes were sensitive to 10 % 1 , 6 - HD treatment and the representative proteins of 10 % 1 , 6 - HD treatment had Fig . 5 Analysis of physicochemical properties of representative proteins under different gradients of 1 , 6 - HD treatment . A Distribution of physicochemical properties of representative proteins in different gradients of 1 , 6 - HD treatment . B InterPro enrichment analysis of representative proteins . - Log10 ( p - value ) was noted in the corresponding cell Page 8 of 11 Zhu et al . BMC Genomics ( 2023 ) 24 : 493 the lowest percentages of IDRs and LCDs and enriched more nucleotide - binding and structural domains . These results suggested that aside from IDR and LCD - depend - ent LLPS , LLPS proteins may have other modes of inter - actions to form biomolecular condensates . Thus , our method provides a new perspective to explain the differ - ent sequence features of LLPS proteins and identify pos - sible physicochemical properties of LLPS proteins . Nevertheless , our method still has a few limita - tions , with one of them concerning histone modifica - tions . Histone modification also plays critical roles in chromatin - associated condensates [ 40 , 41 ] . We found 1 , 6 - HD treatment group enriched greater abundance of histone acetylation - associated proteins than IB treatment group ( Additional file 10 : Figure S5 , Additional file 11 : Table S6 ) . Given that histones bind tightly to DNA , the influences histone modifications have in nuclear conden - sates and their biological functions are difficult to explore with CHS - MS . Future studies should consider targeting specific biomolecular condensates by histone modifica - tions with immunoprecipitation and thus determine the key factors driving LLPS in each class of condensates . In addition , we noticed that CHS - MS enriched mito - chondria - associated proteins ( Figs . 1C and 4C ) while salt extraction experiment [ 26 ] also enriched these proteins ( Additional file 12 : Figure S6A ) . We further compared the abundance of mitochondria - associated proteins in whole - cell and CHS - MS extractions and found lower abundance of these proteins in CHS - MS extractions ( Additional file 12 : Figure S6B ) . Future researchers should improve nuclear extraction methods to effectively remove cytoplasmic components such as mitochondria . Another limitation of our study lies in the possible influ - ence of RNAs in biomolecular condensate formation . By comparing the protein types of the captured proteins in the 1 , 6 - HD and IB treatment groups , we found that 1 , 6 - HD treatment captured more RBPs . This result suggested that RNA may also play an important role in nuclear condensates . A previous study has shown that non - coding RNAs ( ncRNAs ) , which are spatially restricted molecules , form nuclear condensates via the process of “seeding” [ 42 ] . For example , nucleoli use ribosomal pre - cursor RNAs to recruit protein aggregates [ 43 , 44 ] , and paraspeckles use long ncRNA nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1 ( NEAT1 ) as the scaffold molecule to recruit other proteins for local aggregation [ 45 ] . The properties of ncRNAs allow them to contribute to the “seeding” of nuclear compartments . For instance , the transcription process generates multiple copies of ncRNAs , which accumulate in high concentrations near transcription sites . Moreover , these spatially restricted ncRNAs con - tain sequence motifs and secondary structures that could bind diffusible RNAs and proteins , allowing these diffusible molecules to accumulate at high concentra - tions locally . Therefore , further studies applying CHS - MS should consider capturing nuclear ncRNAs together with proteins , which could lead to an enhanced understand - ing of the formation of nuclear biomolecular condensates and the biological processes they participate in with the phase separation proteins and ncRNAs . Conclusions In summary , the CHS - MS experimental method is more convenient and less time - consuming than the exist - ing methods used to investigate the LLPS properties of CAPs . This method could also be extended to different biological systems to help researchers rapidly enrich rep - resentative proteins in different gradients of 1 , 6 - HD and systematically explore their physicochemical properties . Materials and methods Cell culture K562 ( ATCC ) cells were grown in RPMI 1640 ( Gibco ) and supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( Gibco ) and streptomycin ( Gibco ) at 37 °C with 5 % CO 2 . Protein extraction To separate cytosolic and nuclear fractions , a Minute ™ cytoplasmic and nuclear extraction kit ( # SC - 003 ; Invent Biotechnologies ) was used according to the manufacturer’s protocol . Briefly , 10 6 K562 cells were washed in cold PBS and lysed following incubation with 200 μl cytoplasmic extraction buffer on ice for 5 min with vigorous vortexing for 15 s . Next , the lysates were centrifuged at 14 , 000 × g for 5 min at 4 ℃ to obtain the cytosolic and membrane fractions ( supernatant ) and nuclear fraction ( pellet ) . The nuclear pellet was then washed with 0 . 5 ml cold PBS and centrifuged at 8 , 000 × g for 5 min at 4 ℃ . Sequentially , 100 μl of cold PBS , 2 % , 5 % , and 10 % 1 , 6 - HD dissolved in PBS were added to the pellet by mixing , incubated for 5 min at 4 ℃ , and centrifuged at 14 , 000 × g for 30 s at 4 ℃ to obtain the IB , 2 % , 5 % , and 10 % 1 , 6 - HD fractions . LC – MS / MS analysis Samples were analysed on Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Plus mass spectrometers ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Rockford , IL , USA ) coupled with an Easy - nLC 1000 nanoflow LC system ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . Dried peptide sam - ples were re - dissolved in solvent A ( 0 . 1 % formic acid in water ) , loaded to a trap column ( 100 μm × 2 cm , home - made ; particle size , 3 μm ; pore size , 120 Å ; SunChrom , USA ) with a max pressure of 280 bar by using solvent A , and then separated on a homemade 150 μm × 12 cm sil - ica microcolumn ( particle size , 1 . 9 μm ; pore size , 120 Å ; SunChrom , USA ) with a gradient of 5 % – 35 % mobile phase B ( acetonitrile and 0 . 1 % formic acid ) at a flow rate Page 9 of 11 Zhu et al . BMC Genomics ( 2023 ) 24 : 493 of 600 nl / minutes for 75 min . For detection with Fusion Lumos MS , a precursor scan was carried out in the Orbitrap by scanning m / z 300 − 1400 with a resolution of 120 , 000 at 200 m / z . The most intense ions selected under top - speed mode were isolated in Quadrupole with a 1 . 6 m / z window and fragmented by higher - energy col - lisional dissociation with normalized collision energy of 35 % and then measured in the linear ion trap by using the rapid - ion trap scan rate . The automatic gain control tar - gets were 5 × 10 5 ions with a max injection time of 50 ms for full scans and 5 × 10 3 with 35 ms for MS / MS scans . The dynamic exclusion time was set as 18 s . Data were acquired using the Xcalibur software ( Thermo Scientific ) . Peptide identification and protein quantification Raw sequencing data were searched against the National Center for Biotechnology Information Ref - seq human proteome database in Firmiana implemented with the Mascot search engine ( Matrix Science , version 2 . 3 . 01 ) [ 46 ] . The mass tolerances were set as 20 ppm for pre - cursor ions and 0 . 05 Da for product ions ; N - acetylation and oxidation of methionine were set as variable modi - fications ; and cysteine carbamidomethylation was set as a fixed modification . The peptide FDR was 1 % . Proteins with at least one unique peptide and two strict peptides or more than two strict peptides ( mascot ion score ≥ 20 ) were defined as high - confidence proteins . The high - confidence proteins detected in at least one sample were selected for subsequent analysis to further increase the reliability . Peak area values were used to calculate protein quantification . The missing data were inputted with the minimum values . Quantile normalization was applied after missing value imputation . Statistical analysis P - value was calculated to measure the statistical sig - nificance of TF , TC and RBP enriched in 1 , 6 - HD treat - ment group by chi - square test . P - value was calculated to measure the statistical significance of protein abundance difference of different treatment groups by independent samples t test and Mann – Whitney rank sum test . Gene ontology enrichment analysis Gene ontology analysis was conducted using Enrichr [ 47 ] . Protein annotations The TF and coactivator annotations are from animalT - FDB [ 48 ] . The RNA binding protein annotations are from EuRBPDB [ 49 ] . The nuclear puncta protein annotations are from OpenCell [ 17 ] . The nucleolar rim and nuc pro - tein annotations are from HPA [ 50 ] , where the nuc por - tion of the protein includes nucleoli and nucleolus fibrillar center , as defined in HPA . Mitochondria - associated protein and histone - related protein annotations are from Gene Ontology [ 51 ] . Protein sequence analysis and LLPS annotations IDRs were predicted using ESpritz [ 52 ] , with a thresh - old set at 5 % FPR . The LCDs were predicted using SEG [ 53 ] under default parameters . The scores shown in the present paper are the ratio of IDRs and LCDs to the full length of the protein sequence . PScore [ 23 ] and cat - GRANULE [ 24 ] scorings were calculated under default parameters . SaPS and PdPS scorings were provided by PhaSePred [ 25 ] for the eight features scoring .
