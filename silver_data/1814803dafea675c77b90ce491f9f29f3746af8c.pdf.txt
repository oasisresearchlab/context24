MIR4697 rs329648 was associate with risk of developing PD in Chinese population . 3 . The TT genotype of rs329648 increase the risk of PD in male but not in female . Abstract A large meta - analysis recently identified six new loci associated with risk of PD , but subsequent studies have given discrepant results . Here we conducted a case - control study in a Han Chinese population in an attempt to clarify risk associations in Chinese . Among the four single - nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) that we examined - VPS13C - rs2414739 , MIR4697 - rs329648 , GCH1 - rs11158026 , and SIPA1L2 - rs10797576 we detected a significant association between rs329648 and risk of developing PD in a recessive model . This association remained significant after adjusting for gender and age ( OR 1 . 87 , 95 % CI 1 . 295 - 2 . 694 , p = 8 . 21 x 10 - 4 ) or Bonferroni correction . The T allele of rs329648 occurred significantly more frequently among patients with PD than among healthy controls ( OR 1 . 22 , 95 % CI 1 . 033 - 1 . 443 , p = 0 . 02 ) , while there was no statistic significant after Bonferroni correction . Subgroup analysis showed a significant association specifically among males in a recessive model ( OR 1 . 943 , 95 % CI 1 . 200 - 3 . 147 , p = 0 . 007 ) . In contrast , genotye and allele frequencies at rs329648 did not differ significantly between female patients with PD and healthy female controls , or between patients with early - onset or late - onset PD . Our results suggest that rs329648 is associated with risk of developing PD in the Han Chinese population . Our findings should be verified in further studies , and they highlight the need for functional studies of MIR4697 . Keywords : Parkinson ’ s disease , GCH1 , SIPA1L2 , VPS13C , MIR4697 , single - nucleotide polymorphism Introduction Parkinson ’ s disease ( PD ) , the second most frequently occurring neurodegenerative disease , is characterized by loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra ( SN ) area of the brain . Aggregation of - synuclein in survival dopaminergic neurons results in asymmetric onset of static tremor , bradykinesia , rigidity and posture and gait instability [ 1 ] . The pathogenesis of PD remains elusive , with many hypotheses proposed including oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction ; most researchers believe that PD results from complex interactions between environmental and genetic factors . Advances in genomic technology in the last three decades have led to the identification of several genes potentially linked to PD based on pedigree analysis , including SNCA , PANK2 , PINK1 , DJ - 1 , and VPS35 [ 2 ] . Since familial PD accounts for only 10 % of all PD cases , other genetic risk factors are likely to contribute to sporadic PD . Recent genome - wide association studies ( GWAS ) and targeted association studies in different ethnic groups have identified more than 20 chromosomal loci associated with PD [ 2 ] . A meta - analysis synthesizing data from five GWAS defined a novel PD susceptibility locus , RIT2 , on chromosome 18 ( rs12456492 , p = 5 × 10 - 5 ) [ 3 ] . Subsequent replication studies have verified this association in Asian and specifically Chinese populations [ 4 - 6 ] . An even larger meta - analysis based on GWAS involving 13 , 708 cases and 95 , 282 controls identified 26 loci , of which 24 were replicated in an independent set of 5 , 353 cases and 5 , 551 controls . These 24 loci included 6 new risk loci for PD : INPP5F - rs117896735 , VPS13C - rs2414739 , MIR4697 - rs329648 , GCH1 - rs11158026 , DDRGK1 - rs8118008 and SIPA1L2 - rs10797576 ) [ 7 ] . While a subsequent replication study on a Chinese population in Taiwan verified the association of MIR4697 - rs329648 and GCH1 - rs11158026 with risk of PD [ 8 ] , a study on Chinese from southwest of mainland China did not replicate either of these associations [ 9 ] . Given these inconsistent results and ethnic heterogeneity in many of the association studies in the PD literature , we wanted to help clarify potential risk associations in Chinese populations . Therefore we conducted a case - control study to examine the potential association of four new loci ( VPS13C - rs2414739 , MIR4697 - rs329648 , GCH1 - rs11158026 , and SIPA1L2 rs10797576 ) with risk of PD in a Han Chinese population . Subjects and methods Subjects A total of 589 Han Chinese patients with sporadic PD were consecutively recruited from two movement disorder centers : West China Hospital of Sichuan University , located in southwest China ; and the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat - sen University , located in southeast China . Patients were independently diagnosed by two movement disorder specialists according to UK PD Society Brain Bank criteria for idiopathic PD [ 10 ] . Familial patients who had one or more relatives with the disease were excluded . Patients were divided into those with late - onset PD ( LOPD ) if age at onset was > 50 years ; others were classified as having early - onset PD ( EOPD ) . As a control group , healthy Han Chinese without a history of neurodegenerative disease were recruited . The study protocol was approved by the ethics committees of Sichuan University and Sun Yat - sen University . Written informed consent was obtained from all individuals . All experiments were performed according to the approved guidelines and regulations . The study was performed according to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki . Genotyping Genomic DNA was obtained from peripheral leukocytes using the classical phenol - chloroform DNA extraction method . Single - nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) were genotyped using a customized 2x48 - Plex SNPscan TM Kit ( cat . no . G0104 , Genesky Biotechnologies , Shanghai , China ) . This kit was developed by Genesky Biotechnologies based on their patented SNP genotyping technology involving double ligation and multiplex fluorescence PCR [ 11 ] . PCR products were separated and detected by capillary electrophoresis on an ABI3730XL sequencer , and raw sequence data were analyzed using GeneMapper 4 . 0 . Genotypes at each locus were determined based on the labeling color and size of products from the allele - specific ligation PCR . The following quality control measures were taken . First , the researchers who performed genotyping were blinded to sample identity . Second , 20 % of samples were randomly selected and re - genotyped by a different researcher , which gave a 100 % replication rate . Third , 10 samples showing each of the observed genotypes based on the ligase detection reaction were sequenced directly on an ABI Prism 3730 , again giving a 100 % reproducibility rate . Statistical analysis Values for age were reported as mean ± standard deviation ( SD ) , while values for gender composition , allele and genotype frequencies were reported as percentages . Allele and genotype frequencies were determined by direct counting of alleles . Concordance of the genotype distribution in the control group with predictions of Hardy - Weinberg equilibrium ( HWE ) was assessed . Differences between males and females were assessed for significance using the chi - squared test , while the difference in age between patients with PD and healthy controls was assessed using Student ’ s t test . Logistic regression was carried out using PD as the dependent variable , while age , gender , and genotype served as independent variables . The threshold of significance was defined as a two - tailed p < 0 . 05 . All statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS 17 . 0 ( IBM , Chicago , USA ) . Power calculations were carried out using PS Power and Sample Size software . Results The study involved 589 patients with sporadic PD ( 329 men , 260 women ) with an average age of 64 . 38 ± 11 . 26 yr ( range , 28 - 88 yr ) and an average age at symptom onset of 59 . 20 ± 10 . 80 yr ( range , 18 - 87 yr ) ( Table 1 ) . Patients were divided into those with LOPD ( n = 414 ) , who had a mean age at onset of 63 . 72 ± 7 . 09 yr ; and those with EOPD ( n = 175 ) , who had a mean age at onset of 43 . 48 ± 5 . 56 yr . The mean age among the 634 healthy controls ( 365 men , 269 women ) was 63 . 86 ± 12 . 63 yr ( range , 18 - 89 ; Table 1 ) . Gender composition and age were similar between the group of patients with PD and controls ( Table 1 ) . The distributions of genotypes for four SNPs in the four genes were in HWE ( Table 2 ) , and the frequencies of genotypes and minor alleles at the four loci were similar between patients and controls for all SNPs except SNP rs329648 ( Table 2 ) . Analysis based on a recessive model indicated significant association between rs329648 and risk of developing PD , and this association remained significant after adjusting for gender and age ( OR 1 . 87 , 95 % CI 1 . 295 - 2 . 694 , p = 8 . 21x10 - 4 ; Table 2 ) or Bonferroni correction . The frequency of the T allele at rs329648 was significantly higher among patients than controls ( OR 1 . 22 , 95 % CI 1 . 033 - 1 . 443 , p = 0 . 02 ; Table 3 ) , while there was no statistic significant after Bonferroni correction . Since our research involved 589 cases and 634 controls , it had 91 . 4 % power to detect an association between rs329648 and risk of PD at an odds ratio of 1 . 86 under the recessive model at a significance level of 0 . 05 , assuming a TT genotype frequency of 0 . 08 in controls . Subgroup analysis was performed based on gender and age at onset . Among male patients and controls , rs329648 was associated with risk of PD in a recessive model ( OR 1 . 943 , 95 % CI 1 . 200 - 3 . 147 , p = 0 . 007 ; Table 4 ) , though no individual allele appeared to be associated with disease ( Table 4 ) . Among females , frequencies of genotypes or minor alleles did not differ significantly between patients and controls . Similar lack of association was observed when comparing EOPD and LOPD patients ( Table 4 ) . Discussion This case - control study in Han Chinese patients with PD from mainland China suggests that rs329648 is associated with PD . The TT genotype of rs329648 appear to increase the risk of developing PD , though subgroup analysis suggests that the TT genotype increases risk in men but not women . We failed to replicate associations between risk of PD and three other SNPs ( VPS13C - rs2414739 , GCH1 - rs11158026 , SIPA1L2 rs10797576 ) previously reported in other Chinese and Western populations [ 7 - 9 ] . Our results are consistent with those of a large meta - GWAS study indicating an association between rs329648 and PD [ 7 ] . A study on Chinese in Taiwan [ 8 ] also indicated such an association but in the opposite direction : the meta - GWAS and our results suggest that rs329648 increases risk of developing PD , whereas the Taiwan study suggests that it decreases risk . The discrepancy between our study and the Taiwan study may reflect differences in genetic background or in gene - environment interactions . Our cohort came from the southwest and southeast of mainland China , and the minor allele frequency in our control group was 32 % , lower than that reported in the Taiwan study ( 37 . 4 % ) [ 8 ] , although similar to that reported in another study from mainland China ( 32 . 5 % ) [ 9 ] . Our sample size was similar to that of the Taiwan study , and it had a power of 0 . 91 to detect an association between rs329648 and PD in a recessive model . Genetic differences also likely help explain why we failed to replicate associations of PD risk with the SNPs VPS13C - rs2414739 and SIPA1L2 - rs10797576 , which were reported in studies on Chinese populations from mainland China and Taiwan [ 8 , 9 ] , as well as why we failed to detect an association of PD risk with GCH1 - rs11158026 , which was reported not only in the Taiwan study [ 8 ] but also in a large meta - GWAS involving Asian and Caucasian populations [ 7 ] . In the case of rs11158026 , it is already known that the minor allele is the C allele in Asian populations [ 8 , 9 , present study ] but the T allele in Caucasian populations [ 7 ] . Epidemiological studies show that PD occurs more often in men than in women , with an increased relative risk of 1 . 5 [ 12 ] . Several gender - specific SNPs have been associated with risk of PD , including C ( - 260 ) > T polymorphism in the gene encoding the CD14 monocyte receptor , which is a genetic risk factor in women [ 13 ] ; rs12817488 [ 14 ] and the rs373371 [ 15 ] has been proposed to be a risk factor in men [ 12 ] ; and a Val / Val genotype at rs4680 has been associated with younger age at onset in men [ 16 ] . Interestingly , we detected a sex difference in the genotype distribution of rs329648 : the TT genotype appeared to increase the risk of developing PD in Han Chinese men but not women in our cohort . In contrast , no allele or genotype at rs329648 appeared to influence age at onset . The function of MIR4697 is unclear , making it difficult to speculate on how SNPs in this gene may contribute to PD pathogenesis . MIR4697 belongs to the family of microRNA ( miRNAs ) , which are non - coding RNAs 20 - 24 nt long that post - transcriptionally regulate gene expression in multicellular organisms by affecting both stability and translation of mRNAs [ 17 ] . These miRNAs have been shown to play an important role in in cancer [ 18 ] as well as the neurodegenerative disorders including PD based on data from patients and animal models [ 19 - 23 ] . Polymorphisms in genes encoding miRNAs as well as in the target sites of miRNAs have been associated with PD [ 24 ] . Our results suggest the need for functional studies of MIR4697 in order to clarify its potential role in PD . Although our study involved a relatively large cohort and it gave robust results , it does have some limitations . First , all our patients were diagnosed based on clinical presentation and diagnosis was not confirmed by pathology ; this increases the risk that some of our patients may have been misdiagnosed . Second , only certain SNPs were examined in the four genes , leaving open the possibility that other loci in the same or other genes may contribute to risk of PD . Third , this study did not take gene - environment interactions into consideration . Despite these limitations , our study provides strong evidence that rs329648 is associated with risk of developing PD in Han Chinese . Further studies should verify our findings as well as explore the function of MIR4697 .
