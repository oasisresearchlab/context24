To enhance HDR , enabling the insertion of precise genetic modifications , we suppressed the NHEJ key molecules KU70 , KU80 or DNA ligase IV by gene silencing , the ligase IV inhibitor SCR7 or the coexpression of adenovirus 4 E1B55K and E4orf6 proteins in a ' traffic light ' and other reporter systems . Suppression of KU70 and DNA ligase IV promotes the efficiency of HDR 4 – 5 - fold . When co - expressed with the Cas9 system , E1B55K and E4orf6 improved the efficiency of HDR up to eightfold and essentially abolished NHEJ activity in both human and mouse cell lines . Our findings provide useful tools to improve the frequency of precise gene modifications in mammalian cells . The CRISPR - Cas9 systems ( clustered , regularly interspaced , short palindromic repeats ( CRISPR ) – CRISPR - associated protein ) repre - sent a versatile tool for genome engineering , enabling the induction of site - specific genomic double - strand breaks ( DSBs ) by single guide RNAs ( sgRNAs ) 1 . In mammalian cells DSBs are mostly repaired by the nonhomologous end - joining ( NHEJ ) pathway 2 , 3 , frequently leading to the loss of nucleotides from the ends of DSBs . This enables the efficient construction of knockout alleles through the induction of frameshift mutations 4 . By contrast , the alternative pathway of homology - directed repair ( HDR ) can be used for the introduction of precise genetic modi - fications such as codon replacements or reporter insertions by recom - bination with exogenous targeting vectors , serving as repair template 5 . We reasoned that the efficiency of HDR and thus the construction of precise genetic modifications could be boosted by the transient inhi - bition of NHEJ key molecules , similar to what has been observed for Drosophila embryos with a genetic DNA ligase IV deficiency 6 . To quantitatively determine the outcome of CRISPR - Cas - induced DSB repair , we first generated human HEK293 cells with a ‘traffic light’ reporter 7 ( TLR ) vector integrated into the adeno - associated virus integration site 1 ( AAVS1 ) locus 8 ( Fig . 1a ) . HEK293 cells were transfected with an AAVS1 targeting vector carrying the TLR insert and expression plasmids for Cas9 and an AAVS1 - specific sgRNA ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . Upon selection and genotyping of trans - fected cells , we obtained heterozygous ( AAVS1 TLR / + ) and homozy - gous ( AAVS1 TLR / TLR ) targeted clones harboring the TLR construct in the AAVS1 locus ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . The reporter includes a CAG promoter for expression of a nonfunctional green fluorescent ( Venus ) gene , disrupted by the replacement of codons 117 – 152 with target sequences from the mouse Rosa26 and Rab38 locus , followed by coding regions for a self - cleaving 2A peptide and a red fluorescent ( TagRFP ) gene in a reading frame shifted by 2 bp ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . CRISPR - Cas9 - induced DSBs in the target region that are repaired by means of NHEJ and cause deletions shift the translation to the frame of the 2A - TagRFP in about 1 / 3 of the mutagenic NHEJ events ; this can be detected in reporter cells by the expression of RFP ( Fig . 1b ) . If an intact Venus coding region is provided as repair tem - plate , cells that repair the DSBs by HDR express Venus . For activation of the TLR reporter , we designed two sgRNAs against the Rosa26 target sequence , of which sgRosa26 - 1 showed a higher activity to induce deletions in the endogenous locus of mouse NIH3T3 cells ( Fig . 1c ) . Next , we transfected AAVS1 TLR / + cells with an expression vector for Cas9 , blue fluorescent protein ( BFP ) and sgRosa26 - 1 , together with a linearized Venus donor plasmid . 72 h after transfection the cells were analyzed by FACS , gated for BFP + transfected cells , and the frequency of Venus + and of RFP + cells was determined . We observed 3 % RFP + and 5 % Venus + cells , indications of NHEJ or HDR repair events , respectively , as compared to 0 . 1 % RFP + and 0 . 6 % Venus + cells in a control lacking sgRosa26 - 1 ( Fig . 1d ) . Of note , RFP + cells detected by the TLR assay represent only 1 / 3 of all mutagenic NHEJ events . Similar results were obtained with AAVS1 TLR / TLR cells ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . For suppression of key NHEJ pathway proteins 2 , 9 by short hairpin ( sh ) RNAs , we added a human H1 promoter to the sgRosa26 - 1 / Cas9 / BFP expression vector and inserted published shRNA sequences to knock down KU70 , KU80 or DNA ligase IV .

A substantial suppression of NHEJ repair was observed upon the individual or combined knockdown of KU70 , KU80 or DNA ligase IV ( Fig . 1e and Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . Similar results were obtained in AAVS1 TLR / TLR cell lines by the knockdown of KU70 , KU80 or DNA ligase IV ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . The knockdown of ligase IV reduced its protein level in transfected AAVS1 TLR ( BFP + ) cells by 70 % ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . As additional approaches to DNA ligase IV inhibition , we used the small - molecule inhibitor SCR7 ( ref . 10 ) or the adenovirus 4 ( Ad4 ) E1B55K and E4orf6 proteins , which mediate the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of DNA ligase IV 11 , 12 . For the coexpression of Ad4 proteins , sgRosa26 - 1 , Cas9 and BFP from a vector pair , we linked the Ad4 E1B55K or the Ad4 E4orf6 gene by self - cleaving 2A peptide sequences to BFP ( Fig . 1f ) . Mono - or biallelic AAVS1 TLR cell lines were transfected with either the sgRosa26 - 1 – Cas9 - BFP expression vector ( in the presence or absence of SCR7 inhibitor ) or both sgRosa26 - 1 / Cas9 / BFP / Ad4 E1B55K and E4orf6 plasmids . The presence of SCR7 n p g © 201 5 N a t u r e A m e r i ca , I n c . A ll r i gh t s r ese r ve d . nature biotechnology volume 33 NumBeR 5 mAY 2015 545 L E t t E R S reduced the fraction of RFP + cells in the BFP + population fourfold whereas the coexpression of Ad4 proteins led to an eightfold reduction , compared to controls lacking inhibitor or Ad4 proteins ( Fig . 1f and Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . The coexpression of Ad4 proteins reduced the level of DNA ligase IV protein in transfected AAVS1 TLR ( BFP + ) cells by 93 % ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . Overall , these results show that the NHEJ repair of CRISPR - Cas9 - induced DSBs can be suppressed by targeting DNA ligase IV using RNA interference , SCR7 or , most efficiently , the Ad4 proteins . To assess the effect of NHEJ suppression on HDR , we transfected AAVS1 TLR / + cells with Venus repair template together with sgRosa26 - 1 / Cas9 / BFP vector ( with and without SCR7 ) or with sgRosa26 - 1 / Cas9 / BFP vectors including either the Ad4 proteins or shRNA constructs tar - geting KU70 , KU80 or DNA ligase IV . After 72 h the frequency of RFP + and Venus + cells within BFP + cells was analyzed by FACS ( Fig . 2a , b and Supplementary Fig . 7 ) . Venus + ( HDR ) cells increased from 5 % for sgRosa26 - 1 / Cas9 / BFP alone , to 8 – 14 % in the presence of single shRNAs against KU70 , KU80 or DNA ligase IV , to 25 % in the presence of shRNAs against KU70 and DNA ligase IV or 1 µ M of the inhibitor SCR7 , and further to 36 % upon the coexpression of the Ad4 proteins . Thus , HDR efficiency was enhanced up to fivefold in the presence of KU70 and ligase IV shRNAs or SCR7 , and up to sevenfold by the Ad4 protein pair ( Fig . 2c and Supplementary Fig . 8 ) . Titration of SCR7 on AAVS1 TLR / + cells showed an optimal effect at 1 µ M concentration ( Supplementary Fig . 9 ) . For cells in the pres - ence of two shRNAs , SCR7 or Ad4 proteins , we noticed diminished fluorescence signals within the population of Venus + cells at 72 h after transfection ( Fig . 2a and Supplementary Figs . 7 , 9c ) , indicating reduced Venus expression in cells undergoing NHEJ blockade , possibly caused by local chromatin remodeling through an extended DNA damage response 13 , 14 . However , Venus expression was normal in clones estab - lished from AAVS1 TLR / + cells targeted in the presence of Ad4 proteins , indicating that this effect is only transient ( Supplementary Fig . 9d ) . From the sample expressing the Ad4 proteins , Venus + cells were sorted , and we established 24 clones to confirm the integrity of the repaired TLR loci using PCR and sequence analysis ( Supplementary Table 2 ) . In contrast to the increase of Venus + cells , RFP + cells decreased from 3 % in the controls to 1 . 7 % , 1 . 4 % or 0 . 6 % in the presence of shRNAs , SCR7 or Ad4 proteins , respectively ( Fig . 2a , b ) . Whether the residual NHEJ activity relies on the KU - and ligase IV – independent alternative end - joining mechanism 15 remains to be determined . Assessing the influence of the lengths of homology regions of the repair template on HDR efficiency , we generated donor templates with 3 ʹ homology regions shortened from 1 , 450 bp as in the original donor template to 350 bp ( Fig . 2d and Supplementary Fig . 10 ) . We transfected AAVS1 TLR / + cells with sgRosa26 - 1 / Cas9 / BFP expression vector and each of the various donor templates , with or without the coexpression of Ad4 proteins . FACS analysis revealed a reduced tar - geting frequency ( 2 % ) for the donor with a 350 bp 3 ʹ homology region whereas the other molecules showed HDR efficiencies in the range of 5 % ( Fig . 2e ) . In the presence of Ad4 proteins the frequency of Venus + cells increased robustly up to 25 % for the 350 - bp donor and to 30 % for the other donor molecules . In line with the previous results , the frequency of RFP + cells was strongly reduced by the coexpression of Ad4 proteins ( Fig . 2f ) . Thus , PCR - generated fragments with combined homology regions of > 1 kb are effective donors for HDR ( Fig . 2e , f and Supplementary Fig . 10 ) . Applying our approach to an endogenous genomic locus , we inserted a GFP reporter gene into the AAVS1 locus of HEK293 cells . The AAVS1 - SA - T2A - GFP targeting vector includes AAVS1 homology regions flanking a splice acceptor site and a 2A peptide sequence linked to GFP , enabling reporter expression by the AAVS1 - derived transcript ( Fig . 2g ) . HEK293 cells were cotransfected with an AAVS1 - specific sgRNA / Cas9 / mCherry ( AAVS1 - 1 / Cas9 / mCherry ) expression plas - mid and the AAVS1 - SA - T2A - GFP targeting vector , with or without coexpression of Ad4 proteins . 72 h after transfection the mCherry + transfected population exhibited 8 % GFP + cells upon expression of sgAAVS1 - 1 / Cas9 alone whereas the coexpression of Ad4 proteins raised the frequency of the cells to 66 % ( Fig . 2h ) . Thus , in line with the TLR results , we observed an eightfold stimulation of gene targeting at the AAVS1 locus by the coexpression of Ad4 proteins . FACS sorting and cloning GFP + cells 48 h after transfection , we found correct GFP gene integration in 45 of 48 samples ( 95 % ) , but only in 60 % of the clones derived from the sample without Ad4 proteins ( Supplementary Fig . 11 and Supplementary Table 3 ) , the remaining cells presumably repre - senting random integrants . Coexpression of Ad4 proteins also promoted HDR efficiency in a mouse Burkitt lymphoma ( BL ) cell line containing an activated PI3 kinase a - subunit 16 linked to an IRES element and a GFP reporter in the Rosa26 locus . We targeted the GFP using a specific sgRNA and a promoterless donor vector replacing GFP by BFP ( Fig . 2i ) . The fraction of BFP + cells indicates HDR efficiency whereas the fraction of GFP – cells indicates Figure 1 Insertion of a traffic light reporter into the AAVS1 locus of HEK293 cells and suppression of the NHEJ pathway .

Mouse BL cells were electroporated with Cas9 and the BFP replacement vector alone or with GFP - specific sgRNA / Cas9 expression plasmid with or without the coexpression of Ad4 proteins . Electroporation with sgGFP and Cas9 led to a transfection efficiency of 40 % , as determined by mCherry expression after 24 h . About half of the transfected cells ( 22 % in total ) lost GFP expression after 72 h ( Supplementary Fig . 12 ) and 10 % of the GFP - cells were BFP + ( Fig . 2j ) . The addition of Ad4 proteins reduced transfection efficiency to 27 % , but again about half of the transfected cells ( 14 % in total ) lost GFP expres - sion after 72 h ( Supplementary Fig . 12 ) . Notably , 50 % of the GFP – cells were now BFP + ( Fig . 2j ) , indicating a fivefold stimulation of HDR by Ad4 proteins . To assess whether a point mutation can be corrected in a tumor cell line , we reverted the T24P codon replacement in the Foxo1 gene n p g © 201 5 N a t u r e A m e r i ca , I n c . A ll r i gh t s r ese r ve d . nature biotechnology volume 33 NumBeR 5 mAY 2015 547 L E t t E R S of Ad4 proteins further increased the targeting efficiency to 100 % and doubled the net yield of homozygous , targeted clones . In summary , we show that for CRISPR - Cas9 - induced mutagenesis the suppression of the NHEJ key enzyme DNA ligase IV is an effec - tive way for engineering precisely targeted mutations into the genome of mammalian cells . The activity of ligase IV can be blocked by gene silencing , small - molecule inhibition or proteolytic degradation , offer - ing diverse approaches for the optimal delivery into target cells . For the proteolytic degradation of DNA ligase IV , we selected the E1B55K and E4orf6 proteins of adenovirus 4 , shown to exert minimal influence on other cellular substrates such as Mre11 or p53 , which are co - targeted by many other serotypes 17 . Nevertheless , we cannot exclude the possibility that HDR stimulation by the Ad4 proteins is mediated by the combined suppression of DNA ligase IV and other regulatory proteins . It could be of further interest to compare the effect on HDR of the E1B55K and E4orf6 proteins of additional adenoviral serotypes and species identified from humans 18 and other vertebrates 19 . Furthermore , the use of Ad4 proteins may be also beneficial for the construction of targeted mouse mutants , as recently shown for zygotes cultured in the presence of SCR7 ( ref . 20 ) . In populations of cells transfected with a sgRNA , Cas9 and Ad4 protein expression plasmids , we presently reach knock - in frequencies of 50 – 66 % . By delivering Cas9 and sgRNAs as synthetic RNAs it may be possible , as shown for human induced pluripotent stemcells 21 , to further enhance gene targeting efficiencies . It will be interesting to apply CRISPR - Cas9 mutagenesis combined with NHEJ suppression also to early embryos of other model organisms and to primary mammalian cells to achieve gene corrections .

We transfected BL cells with a mutation - specific sgRNA and a second sgRNA recognizing the first intron , expression vectors for Cas9 and fluorescent reporters without or together with Ad4 proteins and a targeting vector containing the reverted codon 24 ( and harbor - ing a silent nucleotide replacement ) and a puromycin - resistance gene ( Supplementary Fig . 13 ) . At day 2 transfected cells were isolated by FACS sorting , subjected to puromycin selection , and 53 or 39 clones derived from single cells were established from the sample without or with coex - pression of Ad4 proteins , respectively . Genotyping of these clones by PCR and sequence analysis showed that 43 of the 53 clones derived without Ad4 proteins were mutants , 33 of these were heterozygous and 10 clones ( 19 % ) were targeted on both alleles . In the presence of Ad4 proteins , we found that all 39 clones were targeted , 24 of these were heterozygous and 15 clones ( 38 % ) homozygous mutants .

Human HEK293 and mouse NHI3T3 cells were plated into 24 - well or 6 - well plates at 1 day before transfection . On the day of transfection , these cells were supplied with new complete medium and the DNA mixed with FuGENE HD Reagent ( Promega ) in Opti - MEM ( Invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer’s introduction . After 15 min of incubation at room temperature , the mixture was dropped slowly into the well . For electropor - ation , mouse BL cells were harvested and counted , 1 – 2 × 10 6 cells resuspended with 3 µ g plasmid DNA in 100 ml electroporation buffer and transferred to a 0 . 2 cm cuvette ( Sigma ) and electroporated using a Nucleofactor device ( Lonza ) . Then , cells were transferred into prewarmed complete medium . Cell sorting and flow cytometry . For single - cell cloning , single cells were sorted into 96 - well plates with 150 ml complete medium supplied with 10 µ g / ml Gentamycin ( Lonza ) . These plates were briefly centrifuged and incubated at 37 °C , 5 % CO 2 , the single - cell clones were evaluated 3 days after sorting to exclude multiple cell contamination . Cells were cultured until confluence and duplicated for genotyping PCR . For the bulk sorting , the reporter - positive cells were sorted into 15 - ml Falcon tubes with complete medium , cells were centrifuged and fur - ther cultured or used for the isolation of genomic DNA . For flow cytometry analysis , HEK293 cells were trypsinized and resuspended in PBS / 1 % BSA FACS buffer and analyzed with a Fortessa machine ( Becton Dickinson ) . Mouse BL cells were harvested , centrifuged and resuspended in PBS / 1 % BSA FACS buffer . Genomic DNA isolation , PCR and T7EI assay . Reporter + cells were cultured and harvested at different time points . Single - cell clones were duplicated in 96 - well plates . Genomic DNA was extracted using the QuickExtract DNA extraction kit ( Epicentre ) following the manufacturer’s instruction . For T7EI assay , PCR was done using Herculase II Fusion DNA Polymerase ( Agilent Technology ) with PCR gene - specific primers ( Supplementary Table 4 ) using the following conditions : 98 °C for 3 min ; 35 – 37 cycles ( 95 °C for 20 s , 60 °C for 20 s , 72 °C for 20 s ) and 72 °C for 3 min . PCR products were run on 2 % agarose gels , purified , denatured , annealed and treated with T7EI ( New England Biolabs ) . Cleaved DNA fragments were separated on 2 % agarose gels and the DNA con - centration of each band was quantified using the ImageJ software . Percent values of indels were calculated as described 30 . For genotyping PCR , genomic DNA was amplified using DreamTaq DNA Polymerase ( Thermo Scientific ) with primers listed in Supplementary Table 4 . DNA sequencing . PCR products were directly sequenced by specific primers or cloned into the pSTBlue - 1 Blunt vector ( Novagen ) following the manufac - turer’s protocol . Plasmid DNAs were isolated using the NucleoSpin Plasmid ( Macherey - Nagel ) . Plasmids were sequenced using T7 forward primer ( 5 ʹ - TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG - 3 ʹ ) by the Sanger method ( LGCgenomics , Berlin , Germany ) . Western blot analysis . Transfected AAVS1 TLR Reporter ( BFP + ) cells were iso - lated by FACS and 10 × 10 6 cells were lysed on ice in RIPA buffer ( 20 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 150 mM NaCl 1 , mM EDTA , 1 % NP - 40 , 0 . 1 % SDS , 0 . 1 % sodium deoxycholate ) for 20 – 30 min in the presence of protease inhibitors ( Roche ) . The whole - cell lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 14 , 000 r . p . m . The supernatants were transferred into new tubes and protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay ( Bio - Rad ) . The lysates were boiled at 100 °C for 5 min and loaded on SDS - PAGE gels . Blots were probed with anti - DNA ligase IV ( H - 300 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) and anti - beta - actin ( AC - 74 , Sigma ) antibod - ies .

Cell 123 , 1013 – 1023 ( 2005 ) . ONlINE METHODS Traffic light reporter construct . The traffic light reporter ( TLR ) expression construct was assembled by cloning of PCR fragments encoding a defective Venus ( codons 117 – 152 replaced by a 52 - bp segment derived from the mouse Rosa26 locus ( sgRNA target sequence underlined ) and a 56 - bp segment from the mouse Rab38 gene ) linked to the 2A peptide from Thosea asigna 22 and the cod - ing region of TagRFP 23 in a 2 - bp shifted reading frame ( + 3 ) , cloned in between the CAG promoter and the polyA region of the bovine hGH gene . The CAG promoter was deleted from this plasmid to derive the traffic light targeting vector ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . Cell culture and reagents . Wild - type , AAVS1 TLR HEK293 and mouse NIH3T3 cells were maintained in DMEM ( Gibco ) supplied with 15 % FBS ( Gibco ) , cells were passaged three times per week . The mouse Burkitt lymphoma cell line , generated from a Burkitt - like mouse lymphoma 16 was maintained in DMEM supplied with 15 % FBS , 2 mM HEPES ( Gibco ) , 2 mM sodium pyruvate ( Gibco ) , 2 mM l - glutamine ( Gibco ) , and 1× NAA ( Gibco ) , beta - mercaptoethanol ( Sigma ) and passaged four times per week . For puromycin selection , mCherry + cells were sorted , seeded at 10 3 cells / well and selected with 3 µ g / ml of Puromycin for 2 weeks . Then colonies were counted and single cells were sorted . The SCR7 inhibitor was purchased ( Xcess Biosciences , San Diego , USA ) , 12 h after trans - fection these cells were maintained in complete medium supplied with 1 µ M SCR7 inhibitor until analysis . At SCR7 concentrations of 60 µ M and 10 µ M , we observed a reduction of transfection efficiency and of cell viability . Donor vectors and CRISPR - Cas9 - T2A - reporter vectors . To generate the CRISPR - Cas9 - T2A reporter vector , we amplified T2A - mCherry and T2A - BFP fragment by overlapping PCR and cloned them into FseI / EcoRI sites of plas - mid pX330 ( Addgene , # 42230 ) . The mCherry and BFP templates were derived from the plasmids MSCV - IRES - mCherry and MSCV - IRES - BFP , respectively , a kind gift of Frank Rosenbauer and Martin Janz ( Charite , Berlin ) . To generate the AAVS1 - SA - 2A - Puro - TLR targeting vector , a CAG - Venus + 1 - P2A + 3 - mtagRFP + 3 cassette was cloned into SalI / NotI sites of AAVS1 - SA - 2A - Puro targeting vector ( Addgene , # 22075 ) . In addition , a SA - 2A - GFP fragment was generated by over - lapping PCR and inserted into the XhoI / SalI sites of the AAVS1 targeting vec - tor , with the GFP template derived from a pRosa26 - IRES - GFP plasmid ( V . T . C . , unpublished ) . For reporter replacement in the mouse cell line , the P110 * - IRES - BFP - pA construct was generated by overlapping PCR and cloned into the pST - blue - 1 sequencing plasmid ( Novagen ) . For PCR donor templates , fragments were amplified with Herculase II Fusion DNA Polymerase ( Agilent Technology ) from pVenus + 1 - P2A + 3 - tagRFP plasmid using the same forward primer and different reverse primers ( Supplementary Table 4 ) . Generation of CRISPR - Cas9 vector expressing shRNA or Ad4 proteins . To generate CRISPR - Cas9 - T2A - BFP / mCherry - hH1 - shRNA vectors , we generated the human H1 promoter and MCS sequence by overlapping PCR and cloned it into the NotI site of the CRISPR - Cas9 - T2A - BFP / mCherry plasmid . To obtain CRISPR - Cas9 - T2A - BFP / mCherry - P2A - Ad E1B55K or E4orf6 plasmids , the coding regions for adenoviral serotype 4 proteins were synthesized as mammalian codon – optimized sequences ( Supplementary Table 1 ) by Genscript ( Piscataway , NJ , USA ) . Using these genes and BFP and mCherry template plasmids , we amplified BFP / mCherry - P2A - Ad4 E1B55K and BFP / mCherry - P2A - Ad4 E4orf6 fragments and cloned them into the NheI / EcoRI sites of the CRISPR - Cas9 - T2A - reporter plasmid by Gibson assembly ( New England Biolabs , E2611S ) . sgRNA and shRNAs . sgRNAs were designed based on unique sequences with 20 nt and as the last nucleotide before the PAM signal an A or G was selected . The target sequences should hybridize with the sgRNA scaffold only at low energy as predicted by the Mfold web server ( http : / / mfold . rna . albany . edu / ? q = mfold / rna - folding - form ) . Complementary oligonucleotides were ordered separately , annealed , phosphorylated and cloned into the BbsI sites of the CRISPR - Cas9 - T2A - reporter plasmid ( Supplementary Table 4 ) . For shRNA silencing , shRNA - targeted sequences were selected from previous reports 24 – 29 ( Supplementary Table 4 ) . Complementary oligonucleotides were ordered separately , annealed , phosphorylated and cloned into the BamHI / AflII sites of the CRISPR - Cas9 - T2A - reporter - hH1 plasmid . n p g © 201 5 N a t u r e A m e r i ca , I n c .
