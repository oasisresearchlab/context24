Remarkably little is known about the 18 amount of polymerized actin in contractile rings , so we used low concentration of GFP - Lifeact to 19 count total polymerized actin molecules in the contractile rings of live fission yeast cells . 20 Contractile rings of wild - type cells accumulated polymerized actin molecules at 4 , 900 / min to a 21 peak number of ~ 198 , 000 followed by a loss of actin at 5 , 400 / min throughout ring constriction . 22 In adf1 - M3 mutant cells with cofilin that severs actin filaments poorly , contractile rings 23 accumulated polymerized actin at twice the normal rate and eventually had almost two - fold more 24 actin along with a proportional increase in type II myosins Myo2 , Myp2 and formin Cdc12 . 25 Although 30 % of adf1 - M3 mutant cells failed to constrict their rings fully , the rest lost actin from 26 the rings at the wild - type rates . Mutations of type II myosins Myo2 and Myp2 reduced 27 contractile ring actin filaments by half and slowed the rate of actin loss from the rings . 28 Introduction 29 Cytokinesis separates daughter cells during the last stage of the cell cycle . Amoebas , fungi and 30 animal cells assemble an actomyosin ring to provide force to form a cleavage furrow ( for review 31 see ( Pollard and O ' Shaughnessy , 2019 ) ) . Contractile rings consist of actin filaments , actin 32 binding proteins including alpha - actinin , capping protein , cofilin , formins and type II myosins 33 ( Wu et al . , 2003 ) . In fission yeast , two type II myosins contribute about equally to the rate of ring 34 constriction ( Bezanilla et al . , 2000 ; Laplante et al . , 2015 ) . Myo2 is essential for viability , while 35 the unconventional myosin - II called Myp2 is not . 36 Although actin is the most abundant protein in contractile rings , much less is known 37 about its dynamics than the myosins or actin - binding proteins owing to difficulty tracking actin 38 3 in live cells . Fluorescent phalloidin is widely used to stain actin in fixed cells but this provides 39 only a snapshot . SIR - actin , jasplakinolide conjugated to silicon rhodamine , can stain actin 40 filaments in live cells ( Lukinavicius et al . , 2014 ) , but jasplakinolide will alter actin dynamics . 41 Microinjection of fluorescently labeled actin is an option for some animal cells ( Cao and Wang , 42 1990 ) but has not been exploited for quantitative measurements and may not be feasible for some 43 cells including fungi . Unfortunately , the genetically encoded fluorescent tags tested to date 44 compromise the function of actin during cytokinesis . For example , the formins that nucleate and 45 elongate actin filaments for the contractile ring in fission yeast filter out all the actin fused to 46 either fluorescent proteins such as GFP or small tetracysteine peptide tags ( Chen et al . , 2012 ; Wu 47 and Pollard , 2005 ) . 48 Consequently , only indirect labeling of actin filaments in the contractile ring has been 49 successful . Although less versatile than direct labeling , we measured about 190 , 000 actin 50 molecules , equal to 500 µm of actin filaments , in the fission yeast contractile ring by titration 51 with Lifeact ( Courtemanche et al . , 2016 ) , a small peptide that binds actin filaments ( Riedl et al . , 52 2008 ) . We also estimated the average length of the filaments from the ratio of polymerized actin 53 to formin molecules in the contractile ring . The filaments start at about 1 . 4 µm and shorten 54 gradually during the ring constriction . Despite this progress , little is known about how actin 55 filaments themselves turn over in contractile rings . 56 Cofilins promote actin turnover during endocytosis in yeast ( Chen and Pollard , 2013 ; 57 Okreglak and Drubin , 2007 ) , at the leading edge of motile cells ( Ghosh et al . , 2004 ; Konzok et 58 al . , 1999 ) and in neurite growth cones ( Zhang et al . , 2012 ) . Cofilin is required for the assembly 59 of the cytokinetic contractile ring in fission yeast ( Chen and Pollard , 2011 ; Nakano and Mabuchi , 60 2006 ) . Cofilin mutations that reduce severing activity slowed or prevented the assembly of 61 4 contractile rings , because the precursors to the contractile ring , called cytokinetic nodes , are 62 pulled into large heterogeneous clusters around the equator rather than being organized into a 63 contractile ring . Rings that form slowly from these clusters constrict far more variably than those 64 in wild - type cells ( Chen and Pollard , 2011 ) . 65 Here we expanded our previous study ( Courtemanche et al . , 2016 ) to count polymerized 66 actin in contractile rings of wild - type fission yeast and strains with mutations in cofilin , formin 67 and type II myosins . The cofilin mutant adf1 - M3 with half of wild - type severing activity had 68 strong effects on both contractile ring assembly and disassembly . The contractile rings of the 69 cofilin mutant cells have about twice the normal numbers of actin , formin Cdc12 , Myo2 and 70 Myp2 molecules , while contractile rings of cells with a hypomorphic mutation of formin Cdc12 71 accumulated actin slowly . Remarkably , mutations of either type II myosin , Myo2 or Myp2 , 72 reduced contractile ring actin by half . 73 74 Results 75 Measurement of actin turnover in contractile rings using GFP - Lifeact 76 To measure the number of polymerized actin molecules in contractile rings of live fission yeast 77 over time , we expressed GFP - Lifeact ( GFP - LA ) constitutively from the endogenous leu1 locus , 78 driven by a constitutive Padf1 promoter of the endogenous cofilin gene . All yeast strains used in 79 this study expressed GFP - LA at similar levels ( Fig . S1 ) , which saturates only 6 % of polymerized 80 actin molecules and avoids artifacts during cytokinesis and endocytosis caused by higher 81 concentrations of GFP - Lifeact ( Courtemanche et al . , 2016 ) . Using a calibrated fluorescence 82 microscope ( Wu and Pollard , 2005 ) , we converted the fluorescence intensity of GFP - Lifeact into 83 the numbers of actin molecules in subcellular structures ( Courtemanche et al . , 2016 ) . 84 5 Specifically , we expressed from the endogenous locus Rlc1 , the regulatory light chain for both 85 Myo2 and Myp2 , tagged with tdTomato and used its fluorescence to segment the contractile ring 86 and measure the total GFP - Lifeact fluorescence . 87 Actin accumulated in contractile rings , about half during assembly and about half during 88 18 mins of maturation when the rate was constant at ~ 4 , 900 molecules / min ( Fig . 1A - B and Table 89 1 ) . At the end of the maturation phase , just before cleavage furrow ingression , fully assembled 90 contractile rings contained ~ 200 , 000 polymerized actin molecules , consistent with previous 91 measurements ( Courtemanche et al . , 2016 ) . 92 During contractile ring constriction the number of polymerized actin molecules was 93 constant for the first six minutes , which was not clear in our previous analysis ( Courtemanche et 94 al . , 2016 ) , and then declined steadily at ~ 5 , 400 molecules / min for ~ 20 minutes ( Fig . 1C ) . About 95 50 , 000 actin molecules remained in the contractile ring remnant at the end of constriction , which 96 has not been reported previously . These filaments abruptly dispersed within two minutes , 97 together with the myosin regulatory light chain Rlc1 leaving behind actin patches along both 98 sides of the cleavage furrow ( Fig . 1A ) . 99 Contractile ring assembly and composition in the cofilin hypomorphic mutant adf1 - M3 100 Cofilin is essential for viability , so we used the hypomorphic mutant adf1 - M3 to test the role of 101 cofilin in the dynamics of contractile ring actin filaments . The adf1 - M3 mutation reduces the 102 severing activity of cofilin by more than 50 % and slows contractile ring assembly ( Chen and 103 Pollard , 2011 ) . Actin patches and actin filament bundles stained brighter with Bodipy - 104 phallacidin in fixed adf1 - M3 mutant cells than in wild - type cells ( Chen and Pollard , 2011 ) . 105 However , at that time we lacked quantitative probes to measure polymerized actin in live cells 106 ( Chen et al . , 2012 ) . The cytokinesis defects were less severe in the adf1 - M3 strain than the adf1 - 107 6 M2 strain ( Chen and Pollard , 2011 ) , allowing us to analyze the assembly and disassembly of 108 larger numbers of mature rings . 109 Contractile ring assembly in adf1 - M3 mutant cells was less orderly ( Fig . 2B ) and much 110 more variable than in wild type cells ( Fig . 2B - D ) . Contractile rings of adf1 - M3 mutant cells 111 accumulated actin twice as fast over a similar period of time as wild type cells ( Table 2 ) . 112 Therefore , mature rings of the mutant had on average about 1 . 9 times as much actin as wild - type 113 cells ( Table 1 and Fig . 2A , arrows ) . The peak number of molecules ( 100 , 000 to 600 , 000 ) was 114 much more variable in adf1 - M3 mutant cells than wild - type cells ( Fig . 2D ) . On average , the 115 contractile rings of adf1 - M3 mutant cells had enough actin molecules to assemble ~ 950 µm of 116 filaments ( Table 2 ) . A cross section of such rings would contain ~ 75 filaments in a bundle ~ 160 117 nm wide , if the spacing between the actin filaments is 15 nm like wild - type cells , which have 118 ~ 50 filaments in a bundle of ~ 125 nm wide ( Courtemanche et al . , 2016 ; Swulius et al . , 2018 ) . 119 We conclude that severing by cofilin limits and makes more reliable the assembly of actin 120 filaments in the contractile ring . 121 To estimate the lengths of actin filaments in the contractile ring of adf1 - M3 mutant cells 122 we measured the number of formins in fully assembled contractile rings just before they 123 constricted . Assuming that barbed ends of all contractile ring actin filaments are associated with 124 a formin ( Coffman et al . , 2013 ) , the ratio of total actin to total formin molecules gives the 125 average length of actin filaments , averaging ~ 1 . 5 µm in wild - type cells ( Table 2 ) , similar to the 126 previous estimate ( Courtemanche et al . , 2016 ) . 127 The number of Cdc12 - 3GFP molecules in the contractile rings of adf1 - M3 mutant cells 128 was on average about twice that of wild - type cells and much more variable ( Fig . 3C ) , while the 129 number of formin For3 was the same as wild - type cells ( Fig . 3D ) . As a result , the combined 130 7 number of the two formin molecules was ~ 50 % higher in the contractile rings of the mutant cells 131 ( Table 2 ) . Consequently , the ratio of actin to formins was ~ 25 % higher , translating to an average 132 length of 1 . 9 µm in the mutant cells ( Table 2 ) . 133 The numbers of type II myosins ( Myo2 and Myp2 ) in mature contractile rings of wild - 134 type cells peaked at ~ 7 , 000 myosin molecules ( Fig . 3A - B and Table 2 ) , consistent with previous 135 measurements ( Goss et al . , 2014 ; Wu and Pollard , 2005 ) . This translates to one myosin motor 136 domain for every 76 nm of actin filament and ~ 20 motor domains for every actin filament in the 137 contractile ring . 138 Contractile rings of adf1 - M3 mutant cells that were able to constrict had twice as many 139 myosin molecules as the wild - type cells , translating to one myosin motor domain for every 70 140 nm of filament ( Fig . 3A - B and Table 2 ) . We conclude that reduced severing by cofilin leads to 141 contractile rings with twice the normal numbers of actin , Cdc12 and type II myosin molecules , 142 so the ratios of these three proteins are about the same as in wild - type cells ( Table 2 ) . 143 Effects of a formin mutation on contractile ring assembly 144 Measurements of the time course of actin accumulation in the contractile rings of the cdc12 - 4A 145 formin mutant cells revealed defects in actin that were not appreciated in previous work ( Bohnert 146 et al . , 2013 ) . The essential formin Cdc12 is required for assembly of actin filaments in contractile 147 rings ( Chang et al . , 1996 ; Kovar et al . , 2003 ) . The hypomorphic cdc12 - 4A mutation prevents the 148 phosphorylation of the formin by the essential SIN pathway kinase Sid2 ( Bohnert et al . , 2013 ) . In 149 prior work the mutant cells appeared to assemble normal contractile rings , but our quantitative 150 measurements revealed that the cdc12 - 4A mutation reduced by about half both the rate of 151 accumulation and the final numbers of polymerized actin ( Fig . 2E and Table 1 ) . 152 8 Contractile ring disassembly during constriction in adf1 - M3 mutant cells 153 The contractile rings in 30 % of adf1 - M3 mutant cells ( n = 65 ) either failed to constrict or halted 154 constriction prematurely ( Fig . S2 ) , but those that constricted fully did so at an average rate 155 similar to wild - type cells although with much more variability ( Chen and Pollard , 2011 ) . During 156 ring constriction , the absolute number of actin molecules in the contractile rings of adf1 - M3 cells 157 declined linearly at ~ 5 , 800 / min ( Fig . 4A and B , Table 1 ) , almost identical to wild - type cells . 158 However , the cofilin mutant cells had two defects . First , the large standard deviations showed 159 that rate of actin disassembly varied much more in adf1 - M3 cells than in wild - type cells . Second , 160 the normalized disassembly rate , which took the number of actin molecules in the ring into 161 consideration , was 40 % lower in the mutant than wild - type cells . Thus , normal severing by 162 cofilin is not essential for the disassembly of actin filaments in constricting contractile rings but 163 makes the process much more orderly . 164 Wild - type cells retain both Myo2 ( Fig . 4C ) and Myp2 ( Fig . 4D ) in the contractile ring 165 through the first 20 minutes of constriction before they leave during the last 10 minutes of the 166 constriction as observed earlier ( Wu and Pollard , 2005 ) . In contrast , these myosins persisted at 167 nearly their highest levels for an hour and the time course of the process was much more variable 168 in the adf1 - M3 mutant cells ( Fig . 4C and D ) . In a few cofilin mutant cells , the myosins dwelled 169 at the cell division for more than 10 minutes after the completion of the ring constriction ( Fig . 170 5A ) . Myp2 oscillated as clusters along the contractile ring of the mutant cells , which was rarely 171 observed in the wild - type cells ( Fig . 5A ) . 172 Face views of constricting contractile rings of adf1 - M3 cells revealed linear structures 173 containing both myosin - II isoforms and actin filaments that separated from 60 % ( n = 18 ) of the 174 rings ( Fig . 5B and C ) . Similar structures were observed previously in 3D - reconstructions of 175 9 cofilin mutants adf1 - M2 and - M3 ( Cheffings et al . , 2019 ; Chen and Pollard , 2011 ) . Although the 176 structures containing myosin - II retracted back to the contractile ring , the bundles of actin 177 filaments did not ( Fig . 5C , arrowheads ) . Such shedding of actin filaments was not observed in 178 the wild - type cells . We conclude that contractile rings are far less stable in cofilin mutant cells 179 than wild type cells . 180 Influence of type II myosins on assembly and disassembly of contractile ring actin 181 filaments 182 Mutations of either type II myosin gene in the myo2 - E1 or myp2∆ strains reduced the numbers of 183 actin molecules in contractile rings by more than half compared with wild - type cells at the end of 184 the maturation period and the onset of constriction ( Fig . 6A - B and Table 1 ) . This surprising 185 finding was missed previously . 186 Starting with less than the normal amount of polymerized actin , contractile rings 187 constricted slower in both myo2 - E1 ( 0 . 32 µm / min ) and myp2∆ ( 0 . 30 µm / min ) cells than wild - 188 type cells ( 0 . 36 µm / min ) . These rates are slightly higher than earlier studies ( Laplante et al . , 189 2015 ; Zambon et al . , 2017 ) . After normalization for the initial actin content , the rates that actin 190 left constricting rings were only slightly less than normal in the myo2 - E1 mutant and similar in 191 the myp2∆ strain to wild - type cells ( Table 2 ) . 192 To rule out the possibility that the lower disassembly rates in the myosin mutants were 193 indirectly tied to ring assembly defects , we measured the loss of actin from contractile rings of 194 wild - type cells treated with blebbistatin to inhibit myosin II ( Straight et al . , 2003 ) . Contractile 195 rings in wild - type cells either disintegrated or failed to assemble in blebbistatin concentrations of 196 ≥ 20 µM ( Fig . 6D ) . Treating wild - type cells with mature contractile rings with 10 µM 197 blebbistatin decreased the rate of actin disassembly by 60 % ( Fig . 6C ) . The ring constriction rate 198 10 was also lower by 30 % ( n = 16 ) ( Fig . 6D ) . We conclude that type II myosins contribute to both 199 the assembly and disassembly of actin filaments in contractile rings . 200 201 Discussion 202 Knowing the numbers and dynamics of polymerized actin molecules in the actomyosin 203 contractile ring is essential for understanding the mechanism of cytokinesis , but such 204 measurements have not been made due to the technical challenge of labeling actin directly 205 without disrupting its activity ( Chen et al . , 2012 ; Wu and Pollard , 2005 ) . Indirect probes can 206 produce artifacts , so we measured polymerized actin with a low concentration of GFP - Lifeact 207 that does not disturb endocytosis or cytokinesis ( Courtemanche et al . , 2016 ) . Measurements on 208 beautiful EM - tomograms ( Swulius et al . , 2018 ) confirmed our earlier count of contractile ring 209 actin with GFP - Lifeact ( Courtemanche et al . , 2016 ) . 210 Our method provides valuable , new quantitative data on the accumulation and loss of 211 polymerized actin in contractile rings but does not reveal the behavior , including the turnover , of 212 individual filaments . Experiments with a probe directly on actin molecules will be required to 213 probe the underlying mechanisms . 214 Our measurements revealed several aspects of cytokinesis that were overlooked due to 215 the lack of quantitative data on actin in contractile rings including the phenotypes of yeast strains 216 with mutations in cofilin , myosin and formin genes . The protein products of each of these genes 217 are essential for cytokinesis and their roles are likely to have been conserved during evolution . 218 The role of cofilin in the assembly and composition of contractile rings 219 A mutation that reduces the severing activity of cofilin has a remarkable impact on the molecular 220 composition of the contractile ring : about twice the wild - type numbers of polymerized actin , 221 11 Myo2 , Myp2 and formin Cdc12 . First we consider myosins and then formins and actin for 222 discussion . 223 Myosins : Myo2 and formin Cdc12 are components of cytokinesis nodes that form prior to 224 the assembly of actin filaments ( Wu and Pollard , 2005 ) , so extra numbers of both proteins in the 225 contractile rings of adf1 - M3 cells implies proportionally more cytokinesis nodes . In fact , the 226 nodes were larger in adf1 - M3 mutant cells than wild - type cells ( Chen and Pollard , 2011 ) and 227 likely represent clusters of larger numbers of small , unitary nodes as revealed in wild - type cells 228 by super - resolution microscopy ( Laplante et al . , 2016 ) . We do not know when these extra nodes 229 form or how either reduced severing or more polymerized actin induce their formation . 230 On the other hand , Myp2 is recruited to fully formed contractile rings during the 231 maturation period in a process that depends on actin filaments ( Okada et al . , 2019 ; Takaine et al . , 232 2015 ; Wu et al . , 2003 ) . Thus , the higher numbers of Myp2 molecules in contractile ring of adf1 - 233 M3 cells may follow directly from the high content of actin filaments . 234 Formins and actin : The essential formin Cdc12 nucleates and elongates actin filaments in 235 the contractile ring ( Chang et al . , 1996 ; Kovar et al . , 2003 ) , so more formin Cdc12 in contractile 236 rings of adf1 - M3 cells likely contributes to the rapid accumulation of extra actin filaments and 237 the actin monomer concentration in the cytoplasm sets the rate of growth of individual filaments . 238 On the other hand , no connection between slow severing and excess formin is known . 239 The longer actin filaments in the contractile rings of adf1 - M3 cells are expected for cells 240 with low actin filament severing activity ( Chen and Pollard , 2011 ) and given evidence that 241 cofilin stochastically severs actin filaments connecting the precursor nodes ( Chen and Pollard , 242 2011 ) . Longer filaments may also explain our observation of a negative genetic interaction 243 between cofilin and ain1 mutants ( Chen and Pollard , 2011 ) . 244 12 Since actin filaments accumulate faster in the contractile rings of adf1 - M3 mutant cells , 245 some other mechanism must account for the slow assembly of full contractile rings ( Chen and 246 Pollard , 2011 ) . The most likely mechanism is that slow severing results in the aggregation of 247 nodes that delays the coalescence of the nodes into an organized contractile ring of actin 248 oligomers ( Chen and Pollard , 2011 ) . 249 In contrast to the essential formin Cdc12 , adf1 - M3 cells do not accumulate excess formin 250 For3 , which is not a component of cytokinesis nodes and joins fully assembled contractile rings 251 at a later stage and assembles peripheral actin bundles at the cell division plane ( Coffman et al . , 252 2013 ) . Unlike Cdc12 , its recruitment likely depends on the type V myosin and polarized 253 membrane secretion ( Coffman et al . , 2013 ) . 254 The role of cofilin in contractile ring constriction and disassembly 255 Multiple defects appear during constriction of contractile rings of adf1 - M3 cells . First , 256 constriction is much less uniform than in wild - type cells . About 30 % of the rings fail to complete 257 the constriction . Bundles of actin filaments containing myosins peel from the rings of mutant 258 cells . Second , starting with contractile rings containing much more polymerized actin and both 259 type II myosins , the cofilin mutant cells required more time for all three proteins to leave the 260 rings in a highly variable fashion . Third , type II myosin Myp2 oscillates along the contractile 261 rings as clusters . Nevertheless , the adf1 - M3 mutation does not significantly reduce the rate of net 262 loss of actin filaments from contractile rings as they constrict . 263 The most likely explanation for the variability of contractile ring constriction in the adf1 - 264 M3 cells is that the loss of severing activity compromises the continuous , relatively rapid ( tens of 265 seconds ) turnover of contractile ring components , which is required to maintain orderly force 266 production in computer simulations of constriction ( Stachowiak et al . , 2014 ) . Those simulations 267 assume estimates of continuous protein turnover revealed by photobleaching experiments . 268 13 Dialing down the turnover of polymerized actin , Cdc12 and Myo2 in these simulations , resulted 269 in the loss of tension in less than 3 minutes . Cofilin contributes to this turnover by severing actin 270 filaments , while other uncharacterized processes cause the exchange of Cdc12 and Myo2 with 271 cytoplasmic pools . 272 Role of formins in the assembly of the contractile ring 273 Counting polymerized actin revealed unrecognized defects caused by the cdc12 - 4A mutation . 274 This mutation prevents phosphorylation of Cdc12 by the SIN pathway kinase Sid2 , but does not 275 cause any discernable cytokinetic defects ( Bohnert et al . , 2013 ) . Although cytokinesis appears 276 normal , contractile rings in cdc12 - 4A mutant cells accumulate actin slower and in less than half 277 the number of wild - type cells . This previously overlooked actin assembly defect may explain the 278 hyper - sensitivity of this strain to Latrunculin A ( Bohnert et al . , 2013 ) as well as the genetic 279 interaction of the cdc12 - 4A mutation with many other cytokinetic mutants . 280 Roles of type II myosins in the assembly of the contractile ring 281 Our experiments revealed to our surprise that mutations of type II myosins strongly reduce the 282 actin content of contractile rings . This remarkable , unexpected finding had been missed in 283 dozens of studies on these mutant strains due to the lack of methods to measure actin in live 284 cells . During ring assembly , Myo2 in a given node pulls on actin filaments growing from nearby 285 nodes ( Vavylonis et al . , 2008 ) . In a reconstituted system , force on a filament growing from 286 formin Cdc12 slows its elongation ( Zimmermann et al . , 2017 ) . However , the loss of Myo2 287 activity in the myo2 - E1 mutant has the opposite effect , resulting in more actin filaments , so the 288 mechanism reducing the actin content is not clear . Myp2 is not present in contractile rings until 289 after they form , so it must have its effect on the half of the actin that assembles during the 290 maturation period , which is slower in the myp2  mutant than wild - type cells . 291 14 The role of type II myosins in constriction and disassembly of the contractile ring 292 Contractile rings with half the normal amount of actin filaments constrict 10 % slower in the 293 myo2 - E1 strain and 20 % slower in the myp2∆ strain than wild - type cells ( Laplante et al . , 2015 ) . 294 Disassembly of actin filaments is slower in both myosin mutants than wild - type cells , although 295 these rates are the same as wild - type when normalized for the starting actin content . Previously , 296 the defects in ring constriction in the strains with myosin - II mutations was attributed entirely to 297 loss of function of the myosins ( Laplante et al . , 2015 ; Zambon et al . , 2017 ) . However , these 298 strains have a secondary defect , a loss of about half the normal polymerized actin . This insight 299 emphasizes the importance of quantitative measurements of other contractile ring components in 300 mutant strains . 301 Inhibition of myosins with 10 µM blebbistatin reduced both the disassembly rate of actin 302 filaments and the ring constriction rate by ~ 60 % and 30 % respectively . In addition to cofilin - 303 mediated severing , forces produced by myosins may contribute to actin filament turnover during 304 contractile ring constriction . 305 Collectively , our experiments demonstrate the value of measurements of polymerized 306 actin in live cells . These measurements provided new , unanticipated features of contractile ring 307 assembly and constriction , which will motivate future studies to characterize mechanisms . 308 309 Materials and methods 310 Yeast genetics 311 We followed the standard protocols for yeast cell culture and genetics . Tetrads were dissected 312 using a SporePlay + dissection microscope ( Singer , UK ) . Table 3 lists all the strains used in this 313 study . 314 15 Microscopy 315 For microscopy , 1 ml of exponentially growing yeast cells at 25°C with a density between 5 . 0 × 316 10 6 / ml and 1 . 0 × 10 7 / ml in YE5s liquid media ( unless specified ) , were harvested by 317 centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 1 min and resuspended in 50 µl YE5s . Due to the extremely slow 318 growth of the adf1 - M 3 cells at 25°C , they were first inoculated at 30°C for a day from the plate , 319 before being inoculated at 25°C for 12 h . 6 μL of re - suspended cells were applied to a 25 % 320 gelatin + YE5s pad and sealed under the coverslip with VALAP ( a mix of an equal amounts of 321 Vaseline , Lanolin , and paraffin ) ( Wang et al . , 2016 ) . Live cell microscopy was carried out on an 322 Olympus IX71 microscope equipped with both a 100× ( NA = 1 . 41 ) and a 60× ( NA = 1 . 40 ) 323 objective lenses , a confocal spinning - disk unit ( CSU - X1 ; Yokogawa , Japan ) , a motorized XY 324 stage with a Piezo Z Top plate ( ASI ) . The images were captured on an Ixon - 897 EMCCD 325 camera controlled by iQ3 . 0 ( Andor , Ireland ) . Solid - state lasers of 488 nm ( 5 % for 100ms except 326 for For3 - 3GFP : 7 . 5 % for 150 ms ) and 561 nm ( 5 % for 50 ms ) were used in the confocal 327 fluorescence microscope . In all experiments , the cells were imaged for 3 h ( 2 - minutes interval 328 unless specified ) by acquiring a Z - series of 15 slices at a step size of 0 . 5 μm using the 100× 329 objective ( unless specified ) . Live cell microscopy was conducted in a room where the 330 temperature was maintained at around 22 ± 2°C . To minimize the variations in culture and 331 microscopy conditions , we imaged both control and experimental groups with randomized order 332 within a week . To measure the relative fluorescence of Cdc12 - 3GFP and For3 - 3GFP , a Z - series 333 of 8 slices with a spacing of 1 μm was used . 334 To image the contractile ring head - on , cofilin mutant cells were observed in a petri dish 335 with a coverslip bottom . A sample of 20 µl of the cell culture was spotted onto a glass coverslip 336 ( # 1 . 5 ) at the bottom of a 10 - mm petri dish ( Cellvis , USA ) . The coverslip was precoated with 50 337 16 µl of 50 µg / ml lectin ( Sigma , L2380 ) and allowed to dry overnight at 4⁰C . The cells were 338 allowed to attach to the lectin for 10 minutes at room temperature . YE5s medium ( 2 ml ) was then 339 added to the dish just before microscopy . Images were acquired at 1 - minute intervals . 340 Drug treatment 341 A sample of 20 µl of the cell culture was spotted onto a glass coverslip on the bottom of a petri 342 dish as described above . YE5s medium ( 2 ml ) with either 10 µ M Blebbistatin or 1 % DMSO was 343 added to the dish before starting microscopy using the 60x objective . Image acquisition was 344 started exactly after 15 min of the drug treatment to minimize experimental variability . 345 Image processing and analysis 346 We used ImageJ ( National Institutes of Health ) to process all the images , with either freely 347 available or customized macros / plug - ins . For quantitative analysis , the fluorescence micrographs 348 were corrected for X - Y drifting using the StackReg plug - in ( Thevenaz et al . , 1998 ) . Average 349 intensity projections of Z - slices were used for actin number measurements . Maximum intensity 350 projections of Z - slices were used for the contractile ring tracking . Kymographs of the rings 351 labeled with Rlc1 - tdTomato were generated to determine both the start and end of ring closure . 352 The customized plug - in Ring Intensities Measurement - 2015 was used to measure the GFP - LA 353 fluorescence during the constriction of rings that went on to complete constriction 354 ( Courtemanche et al . , 2016 ) . The background fluorescence was calculated separately for each 355 cell used for GFP - LA measurement . The corrected GFP - LA fluorescence was then converted to 356 number of actin molecules based on the calibration as described ( Morris et al . , 2019 ) . 357 The number of actin filaments in a cross - section of the contractile ring was calculated by 358 dividing total length of actin filaments with the circumference of a cell . Total length of actin 359 filaments ( µm ) is calculated as total number of actin molecules divided by 370 . The 360 17 circumference of wild - type and adf1 - M3 cells was estimated at 10 and 13 µm respectively ( Chen 361 and Pollard , 2011 ) . The center - to - center spacing between actin filaments is assumed to be 15 nm 362 ( Kanbe et al . , 1989 ; Swulius et al . , 2018 ) in estimating the width of a contractile ring . 363 Western Blots 364 For probing the expression level of GFP - Lifeact , 50 ml of exponentially growing cells were 365 collected by centrifuging at 3000g for 5 min . The pellet was resuspended in 300 µL of lysis 366 buffer containing Halt TM protease inhibitor cocktail ( # 1862209 , Thermo - Fisher Scientific ) and 367 frozen at - 20 ⁰C until lysis . The cells were lysed using BeadBug microtube homogenizer 368 ( Benchmark Scientific ) . Proteins were resolved using Mini - PROTEAN TGX TM Precast SDS - 369 PAGE gels ( # 4561084 , BioRad ) . The gels were either stained with Coomassie blue or transferred 370 to PVDF membrane ( Millipore ) for immunoblots . Membranes were blotted with 1 : 1000 dilution 371 of primary anti - GFP ( # 11814460001 , Sigma - Roche ) over night , followed by 1 : 5000 dilution of 372 HRP - linked secondary antibody ( # sc - 516102 , Santa Cruz ) for 2 h . The blot was developed using 373 SuperSignal TM West Pico PLUS chemiluminescent substrate ( # 34577 , Thermo - Fisher Scientific ) . 374 Acknowledgements 375 Research reported in this publication was supported by National Institute of General Medical 376 Sciences of the National Institutes of Health under award numbers R01GM026132 to TDP and 377 R15GM134496 to QC .
