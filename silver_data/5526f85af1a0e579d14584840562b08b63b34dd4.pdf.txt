BMC Psychiatry ( 2022 ) 22 : 743 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1186 / s12888 - 022 - 04405 - 0 RESEARCH Mental health outcomes following COVID - 19 infection : impacts of post - COVID impairments and fatigue on depression , anxiety , and insomnia — a web survey in Sweden Farzaneh Badinlou * , Tobias Lundgren and Markus Jansson‑Fröjmark Abstract Background : The negative impact of the COVID‑19 pandemic on the mental health is now clearly established . How‑ ever , information on the levels of mental ill health of people infected with COVID‑19 and potential correlates of poor mental health is still limited . Therefore , the current study aimed to study indicative of potential mental health prob‑ lems in individuals with a history of probable or confirmed SARS CoV‑2 infection / infections and address the impacts of post‑COVID impairments and fatigue following COVID‑19 infection / infections on depression , anxiety , and insomnia . Methods : A web‑survey including demographics , questions related to COVID‑19 status and post‑COVID impair‑ ments , and standardized measures of depression , anxiety , insomnia , and fatigue was completed by 507 individuals with a history of probable or confirmed SARS CoV‑2 infection / infections . Results : We found significant rates of significant depression , anxiety , and insomnia in our sample , with more than 70 % experiencing levels above the clinical cut offs for at least one psychological health problems . Higher levels of depression , anxiety , and insomnia were associated with the severity of COVID‑19 infection in the acute phase , hospitalization because of COVID‑19 , and higher levels of post‑COVID impairments and fatigue . Reduced motivation emerged as the strongest predictor for mental ill health . Conclusions : These findings highlight that individuals infected with COVID‑19 , especially those who still have expe‑ rienced post‑COVID impairments , are more likely to suffer from mental ill‑health and may be more vulnerable for poor mental health outcomes . Therefore , more effective actions are needed to take in order to promote and protect mental health of individuals with a history of COVID‑19 infection .

Background Since the beginning of the COVID - 19 pandemic , the study of mental health has been the focus for many investigations around the world . Early studies focused mainly on the psychosocial response to the COVID - 19 pandemic and impacts of pandemic - related strategies , such as quarantine , lockdown , closing schools / universi - ties , movement and travel restrictions , on mental health outcomes in the general population [ 1 – 6 ] . Findings from studies in different countries showed that the prevalence of mental health problems increased significantly in the general population during the COVID - 19 pandemic [ 7 – 11 ] . In Sweden , studies of mental health in the early Open Access * Correspondence : farzaneh . badinlou @ ki . se Department of Clinical Neuroscience , Centre for Psychiatry Research , Karolinska Institutet , and Stockholm Health Care Services , Region of Stockholm , Norra Stationsgatan 69 , 113 64 Stockholm , Sweden Page 2 of 11 Badinlou et al . BMC Psychiatry ( 2022 ) 22 : 743 phase of the COVID - 19 pandemic showed elevated rates of depression , anxiety , and insomnia in the general popu - lation compared with before the pandemic , the same as in other counties [ 12 , 13 ] . With increasing number of COVID - 19 cases and hos - pitalization due to COVID - 19 in the different countries , a possible bidirectional association between COVID - 19 and mental health problems was attracting the atten - tion of researchers [ 14 – 16 ] . On the one hand , pre ‐ exist - ing mental health problems could increase the risk to get COVID infection , or make the outcomes of the infection worse [ 17 – 21 ] . On the other hand , a significant propor - tion of patients with and survivors of COVID - 19 reported numbers of psychological issues , such as post - traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , depression , anxiety , insomnia , and obsessive – compulsive symptoms [ 22 – 26 ] . Follow - up studies on COVID - 19 survivors after dis - charge from hospital or / and recover from COVID - 19 reported an unexpected result called post COVID - 19 condition [ 27 – 29 ] . This condition affects individuals infected with COVID - 19 and is characterized by a wide range of persistent symptoms even after months of the onset of disease or hospitalization [ 28 , 30 – 35 ] . The post COVID - 19 condition has also been widely reported by individuals with the mild - to - moderate symptoms in the acute phase of SARS - CoV - 2 disease , mostly recovered without requiring special treatment or / and hospitaliza - tion [ 36 ] . A recent meta - analysis , including data from fifty studies , shows that the global prevalence of post - COVID condition was 0 . 43 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0 . 39 – 0 . 46 ) . In other words , nearly half of the peo - ple with a history of probable or confirmed SARS CoV - 2 infection experienced mid - and long - term symptoms after recovery from COVID - 19 [ 37 ] . Long ‐ term impacts of COVID ‐ 19 infection can be multi - systemic problems and disabilities , and fatigue in general was the most com - monly reported symptom in previous studies [ 37 – 42 ] . A collaborative cross - sectional study in Japan and Swe - den examining associations between mental health and post - COVID conditions showed that post - COVID con - dition includes mental health issues , such as depression and anxiety , were significantly higher in groups with post - COVID conditions , compared to noninfected groups and infected group without post - COVID conditions . In addi - tion , post - COVID conditions was demonstrated to be a risk for developing mental health illness [ 43 ] . Another study , conducted in Sweden reexamined the prevalence of depression , anxiety , and insomnia in the general popu - lation and the impact of COVID - 19 - related persistent symptoms on these psychiatric symptoms two years after the first appearance of COVID - 19 . Findings showed that the level of depression did not change significantly , the level of anxiety decreased , and the level of insomnia had increased compared with the early phase of the pandemic in Sweden . COVID - 19 - related persistent symptoms were found as an important vulnerability factor for mental ill - health [ 44 ] . However , research on the mental health of people infected with COVID - 19 is still limited , and it is not clear how post - COVID impairments and fatigue , as the most common persistent symptom , might interrelate with mental health outcomes . The first purpose of the current study was to determine indicative of potential mental health problems in individuals with a history of probable or confirmed SARS CoV - 2 infection / infections . To further enhance the knowledge , the second aim of the study was to address the impacts of post - COVID impair - ments and fatigue on mental health outcomes following COVID - 19 infection / infections . Methods Participants and setting of the study A total 507 people was included in the current study . Inclusion criteria were : ( i ) infected with COVID - 19 ; ( ii ) age ( ≥ 18 years ) ; ( iii ) being a resident of Sweden ; ( iv ) ability to understand Swedish and use the internet in order to complete web - survey . The following exclusion criteria was used ; ( i ) age under 18 years old , ( ii ) did not complete scales , or ( iii ) not infected with COVID - 19 . They were therefore unable to complete COVID - 19 - re - lated and post - COVID questions . We used convenience sampling to recruit participants in the current study . In that , an announcement including information about the study and a link to a web - survey was posted in COVID - 19 - related Facebook groups and sites , and the Karolin - ska institute homepages . In order to recruit potential participants , the study information was administered at four primary care centers treating post - COVID patients in Stockholm , Sweden . . The participants’ age ranged between 19 and 81 years old ( M = 47 . 72 , SD = 10 . 62 ) . Demographic information about the participants is pre - sented in Table 1 . Table 2 presents the descriptive statistics of COVID - 19 - related variables . The majority of the participants reported they had been infected with COVID - 19 for the first time in the first and second wave of COVID - 19 in Sweden , spring and autumn 2020 [ 45 ] . Measures Demographic information Demographic variables were age , gender , education , mar - ital status , work status , and economic status . COVID‑19‑related variables COVID - 19 - related variables included infected with COVID - 19 , hospitalization due to COVID - 19 , been high - risk group for COVID - 19 , vaccinated against COVID - 19 , Page 3 of 11 Badinlou et al . BMC Psychiatry ( 2022 ) 22 : 743 and COVID - 19 severity in the acute phase . Infected with COVID - 19 was measured by a single item in which respondents stated on a 4 - point scale if they have / had a confirmed COVID - 19 infection supported by posi - tive tests for COVID - 19 virus ( PCR ) and / or positive rapid antigen test on a 4 - point scale ( yes , I have had it one time , yes , I have had it two times , yes , I have had it more than two times , yes , I believe I’ve had it , but have not had it confirmed ) . Respondent also were asked to state on a binary scale ( yes , no ) if they have / had been hospitalized because of COVID - 19 , high - risk group for COVID - 19 ( including high blood pressure , angina , stroke , heart disease , diabetes , cancer , smoking , respira - tory diseases , and impaired immune system ) , and vac - cinated against COVID - 19 . COVID - 19 severity in the acute phase was measured with 15 items , including fever , fatigue , cough , loss of smell / taste , difficulty breathing / shortness of breath , headache / migraine , aches or pain in body , diarrhea , rash on skin , runny or blocked nose , nausea / vomiting , arrhythmia / palpitations , sore throat , cognitive difficulties such as memory and attention dif - ficulties , and mental health issues such as sleep problems , depression and anxiety [ 46 , 47 ] . Here participants rated symptoms that they had at the beginning of the infec - tion or infections and those the following 4 weeks on a 4 - point scale ( 0 = no , 1 = mild , 2 = moderate , 3 = severe ) considering acute COVID - 19 usually can last up to 4 weeks from the onset of symptoms [ 48 ] . The respond - ents’ answers to the 15 symptoms of COVID - 19 items were summed up to calculate a COVID - 19 severity in the acute phase ( range 0—45 , α = 0 . 77 ) . Post‑COVID impairments The post - COVID impairments in the current study were assessed with 54 items used in our previous study [ 38 ] . The items were based on previous questionnaires devel - oped to examine long - term impacts of COVID - infection such as the Functional Compass COVID - 19 question - naire and the Long COVID Symptom and Impact Tools [ 36 , 49 ] and comprehensive literature review of the long - term effects of COVID - 19 [ 32 , 33 , 48 , 50 , 51 ] . Par - ticipants rated their impairments due to COVID - 19 infection / infections on a 4 - point scale ( 0 = no , 1 = mild , 2 = moderate , 3 = severe ) . Items were categorized into four sub - categories according to the International Clas - sification of Functioning , Disability and Health [ 52 ] as impairments in mental functions including impaired orientation , brain fatigue , lack of appetite , sleep prob - lems , concentration difficulties , attention difficulties , memory problems , impaired organization and planning , impaired mental functions of language , depression , anxi - ety , stress , obsessions , and compulsions ; impairments in sensory functions and pain including poor quality of Table 1 Sample characteristics ( N = 507 ) n % Demographic variabels Gender Female 446 88 Male 61 12 Education Pre‑secondary 14 2 . 8 Secondary 140 27 . 6 University / Post graduate 353 69 . 6 Marital status Single 106 20 . 9 Married 213 42 In a relationship 144 28 . 4 Divorced / separated / widowed 44 8 . 7 Work status Working full time / part time 335 66 . 1 Unemployed / unpaid work 23 4 . 5 Retired 24 4 . 7 Parental leave 5 1 Sick leave 107 21 . 1 Student 13 2 . 6 Economic status Below average 84 16 . 6 Average 247 48 . 7 Above average 176 34 . 7 Table 2 Descriptive statistics of COVID‑19‑related variables n % Infected with COVID‑19 Yes , one time 316 62 . 3 Yes , two times 105 20 . 7 Yes , more than two times 12 2 . 4 Yes , unconfirmed 74 14 . 6 Infected with COVID‑19 for the first time First wave of COVID‑19 in Sweden , spring 2020 160 38 . 4 Second wave of COVID‑19 in Sweden , autumn 2020 88 21 . 1 During the year 2021 95 22 . 8 During the year 2022 74 17 . 7 Hospitalization for COVID‑19 Yes 52 12 . 5 No 363 87 . 5 Being a high‑risk group for COVID‑19 Yes 98 19 . 6 No 403 80 . 4 Vaccinated against COVID‑19 Yes , one dose 21 4 . 1 Yes , two doses 157 31 Yes , three doses 243 47 . 9 No 86 17 Page 4 of 11 Badinlou et al . BMC Psychiatry ( 2022 ) 22 : 743 vision , dry / red / itchy eyes , ringing in ears or tinnitus , dizziness , disturbed balance , loss of taste , loss of smell , feeling of numbness / tingling , generalized pain , pain in head , chest pain , pain in stomach or abdomen , joint pain , and pain in multiple body parts ; impairments body sys - tem functions including voice problems , impaired heart functions , respiratory distress , cough , tiredness or lack of energy ( physical ) , shortness of breath , sore throat / difficult to swallow , vomiting , impaired nutrient uptake , diarrhea , weight change , nausea , fever / feeling of fever , chills / the feeling of freezing , impaired sexual desire and functions , impaired mobility of movement , decreased muscle power , movement problems , skin changes , rash , and hair loss ; and impairments in activities and participa - tion including difficulty taking care of yourself , impaired control of other diseases and drugs , keep special diet , and difficulties in doing housework , impaired work abil - ity / study ability , and difficulty being to leisure activities . The respondents’ answers to each sub - category of post - COVID impairments were summed up and divided the number of items in order to obtain mean for each sub - category as a common way to analysis scores from obser - vational measures in social sciences [ 53 ] . Fatigue The Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory ( MFI ) is self - report instrument to measure fatigue . The MFI is a 20 - item scale and consists of five subscales : general fatigue ( GF ) , physical fatigue ( PF ) , reduced motivation ( RM ) , reduced activity ( RA ) , and mental fatigue ( MF ) . Each scale contains four items . The items are rated on 5 - point scale , from 1 ( Yes , that is true ) to 5 ( No , that is not true ) , scores range from 0 to 20 [ 54 ] . This test yields a total score ( the sum of all items ) and five scale scores calculated as the sum of the items within each subscale . Higher scores indicate higher fatigue levels . The subscale score > 12 was considered clinically significant fatigue [ 55 ] , and the total score > 60 was considered clinically significant multidimensional fatigue [ 56 ] . In this study , we used the Swedish version . Psychometric studies show that the Swedish version of the instrument is reliable and valid [ 57 , 58 ] . Mental health variables Mental health variables were considered as outcome variables in the current study and consisted of depres - sion , anxiety , and insomnia . Depression was measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 ( PHQ - 9 ) . The PHQ - 9 consists of nine items answered on a four - point scale ( 0 – 3 ) , with the total score ranging from 0 to 27 [ 59 , 60 ] . Anxiety was assessed with the General Anxiety Disorder - 7 ( GAD - 7 ) . The GAD - 7 includes seven items answered on a four - point scale ( 0 – 3 ) , scores range from 0 to 21 [ 61 – 64 ] . Insomnia was measured with the Insom - nia Severity Index - 7 ( ISI - 7 ) . The ISI - 7 consists of seven items to assess the nature , severity , and impact of insom - nia answered on a five - point scale ( 0 – 4 ) , the total score ranges from 0 to 28 [ 65 , 66 ] . We used the recommended cutoff scores of ≥ 10 for detecting the clinically significant depression , anxiety , and insomnia in the current study [ 59 , 64 , 66 ] . Procedure The study was approved by the Swedish national ethical board ( dnr 2021 – 06 , 617 - 01 ) and informed consent was obtained from all participants . Participants answered the survey in the online platform , Research Electronic Data Capture ( REDCap ) , hosted locally at Karolinska institute [ 67 , 68 ] . Data were collected between the 23 th of Febru - ary and the 5 th of April 2022 . Statistical analysis The data were analyzed using IBM SPSS ( IBM , Version 26 ) [ 69 ] and checked for normality , missing values , out - liers , or any errors in data . The mean , standard devia - tion , and numbers or percentage were calculated for each continuous and categorical variable . For purposes of analysis , categorical variables were dichotomized ; education ( dichotomous : high education , low educa - tion ) , marital status ( dichotomous : in relationship , not relationship ) , work status ( dichotomous : not working , working ) , economic status ( dichotomous : above average , average and below average ) , and infected with COVID - 19 ( dichotomous : confirmed COVID - 19 infection , not confirmed COVID - 19 infection ) . Zero - order correlations ( Pearson’s r ) were calculated to examine the relationship among all measures and to identify primary predictors of the model . To address the second aim , hierarchical linear regression models were applied to explore the contribu - tion of potential predictors on mental health outcomes . Three separate analyses were employed to estimate the predictors’ association with depression , anxiety , and insomnia as dependent variables . For all three regres - sion models , the significant variables were considered as potential predictors . Due to performing multiple tests on a single dataset , alpha - level was adjusted to p ≤ 0 . 01 in the current study . Results Descriptive statistics for mental health , fatigue , and post‑COVID impairments variables Table 3 presents descriptive statistics for the measures of depression , anxiety , and insomnia . In that , 55 % , 20 . 5 % , and 60 . 9 % of the participants reached the cutoff for clini - cal depression , anxiety , and insomnia , respectively . The majority of the participants reached cutoff for at least one Page 5 of 11 Badinlou et al . BMC Psychiatry ( 2022 ) 22 : 743 psychological health problems ( 74 . 7 % ) . Intercorrelations between these measures were r = 0 . 71 for depression and anxiety scores , r = 0 . 58 for depression and insomnia scores , and r = 0 . 58 for anxiety and insomnia scores . Table 4 includes summary results from the fatigue scores and prevalence rates per domain . Of all par - ticipants , 94 . 7 % ( n = 481 ) reached cutoff for severe fatigue on at least one fatigue dimension , based on cutoff scores > 12 . For more details , 89 . 9 % ( n = 456 ) , 85 . 6 % ( n = 434 ) , 84 . 8 % ( n = 430 ) , 51 . 6 % ( n = 255 ) , and 73 . 4 % ( n = 372 ) met criteria for likely clinically signifi - cant general fatigue , physical fatigue , reduced activity , reduced motivation , and mental fatigue , respectively . Of all participants , 39 . 3 % ( n = 194 ) reached the cutoff for clinically significant multidimensional fatigue . As seen in Table 4 , these measures are intercorrelated ( see Table 4 ) . Those surveyed also provided data on post - COVID impairments , each on a scale from 0 to 3 , higher scores indicating higher levels of impairments . Table 5 includes summary results from the post - COVID impairments . The highest level of impairment was impairments in activities and participation , followed by impairments in mental functions . As seen in Table 5 , these variables are intercorrelated ( see Table 5 ) . Correlational analyses Table 6 presents correlations between the outcome var - iables with participant background , COVID - 19 - related factors , post - COVID impairments , and fatigue dimen - sions . Notably , the background variables failed to sig - nificantly correlate with the mental health outcomes . More serious condition in the acute phase of COVID - 19 infection was significantly related with all three out - come variables . Hospitalization because of COVID - 19 achieved significant but small correlation with insom - nia . Post - COVID impairments and fatigue variables significantly positively correlated with depression , anxi - ety , and insomnia .

BMC Psychiatry ( 2022 ) 22 : 743 Regression analyses Table 7 presents the final results of the hierarchical regression models for depression , anxiety , and insom - nia . In a three - block model , COVID - 19 - related fac - tors including severity of COVID - 19 infection in the acute phase and hospitalization for COVID - 19 were entered into the first block , followed by post - COVID impairments including impairments in mental func - tions , sensory functions and pain , body system func - tions , and activities and participation , entered in block 2 , and fatigue factors including general fatigue , physi - cal fatigue , reduced activity , reduced motivation , and mental fatigue , entered in block 3 . All three blocks reached statistical significance for each of the outcome variables . For depression , fatigue accounted for the largest part of the variance , with (cid:31) R 2 accounting for 23 % of the variance . For anxiety , both fatigue factors and post - COVID impairments accounted similar vari - ance in the equations , with (cid:31) R 2 accounting for 12 % of the variance . For insomnia , COVID - 19 - related factors accounted for the largest part of the variance . Interest - ingly , out of all variables , reduced motivation came out as the most important predictor for all three mental health outcomes . Discussion The first aim of the current study was to examine levels of mental health problems following COVID - 19 infec - tion / infections . The second aim was to study associations between COVID - 19 - related factors , post - COVID impair - ments as well as fatigue and mental health problems in individuals with a history of probable or confirmed SARS CoV - 2 infection / infections . Results showed significant rates of significant depression ( 55 % ) , anxiety ( 20 . 5 % ) , and insomnia ( 60 . 9 % ) in our sample . The correlational analyses show that severity of COVID - 19 infection in the acute phase and hospitalization due to COVID - 19 were significantly correlated with mental health outcomes . All post - COVID impairments and fatigue dimensions were significantly associated with depression , anxiety , and insomnia . In multivariate models , generally , sever - ity of COVID - 19 infection in the acute phase explained a portion of the variance in depression and insomnia and impairments in mental functions explained variance in Table 6 Correlations between potential predictors and depression , anxiety , and insomnia * p < 0 . 01 a Adjusted to exclude depression , anxiety , stress , or sleep problems Potential Predictors Depression ( PHQ‑9 ) Anxiety ( GAD‑7 ) Insomnia ( ISI‑7 ) Background variables Age ‑0 . 06 ‑0 . 145 0 . 104 Gender 0 . 011 0 . 031 0 . 026 Education ‑0 . 095 ‑0 . 041 ‑0 . 111 Marital status ‑0 . 056 0 . 021 ‑0 . 071 Work status 0 . 143 0 . 101 0 . 065 Economic status 0 . 077 0 . 031 0 . 001 COVID‑19‑related variables Infected with COVID‑19 ( Confirmed ) 0 . 030 0 . 141 0 . 101 Severity of COVID‑19 infection 0 . 343 * 0 . 227 * 0 . 288 * Been high‑risk group ‑0 . 084 ‑0 . 061 ‑0 . 110 Hospitalization for COVID‑19 ‑0 . 101 ‑0 . 036 ‑0 . 166 * Vaccinated against COVID‑19 ‑0 . 035 ‑0 . 064 ‑0 . 042 Post‑COVID impairments Impairments in mental functions a 0 . 547 * 0 . 361 * 0 . 342 * Impairments in sensory functions and pain 0 . 392 * 0 . 417 * 0 . 473 * Impairments in body system functions 0 . 417 * 0 . 218 * 0 . 337 * Impairments in activities and participation 0 . 473 * 0 . 257 * 0 . 307 * Fatigue variables General fatigue 0 . 510 * 0 . 262 * 0 . 365 * Physical fatigue 0 . 461 * 0 . 204 * 0 . 286 * Reduced activity 0 . 532 * 0 . 265 * 0 . 297 * Reduced motivation 0 . 568 * 0 . 402 * 0 . 329 * Mental fatigue 0 . 514 * 0 . 340 * 0 . 232 * Page 7 of 11 Badinlou et al . BMC Psychiatry ( 2022 ) 22 : 743 depression and anxiety . However , reduced motivation emerged as the most consistent predictor of all three mental health outcomes . In our study , rates of mental health problems were clearly higher than previous studies using the same measures and cut - off levels , noticeably in depression and insomnia . There are a number of likely explanations . The first possible explanation for these findings lies in our sample and inclusion criteria . In the previous stud - ies , the participants were recruited from social media and age ≥ 18 was a main inclusion criterion [ 12 , 43 , 44 ] , whereas we used convenience sampling targeting indi - viduals with a history of probable or confirmed COVID - 19 infection . As a result , in studies by Matsumoto et al . [ 43 ] and Brocki et al . [ 44 ] , 13 % and 51 . 2 % of the par - ticipants reported that they have been infected with the COVID - 19 , respectively , whereas in our study , 85 % of the participants reported confirmed COVID - 19 infec - tion / infections supported by positive tests for COVID - 19 virus ( PCR ) and / or positive rapid antigen test , including one time , 61 . 9 % , two times , 20 . 7 % , and more than two times , 2 . 4 % . The second possible explanation of these results is that diagnosis of COVID - 19 is likely to be asso - ciated with increased rates of mental health problems and subsequent psychiatric diagnoses . In that , psychi - atric illness and mental health problems such as depres - sion , anxiety , insomnia , post - traumatic stress disorder , obsessive – compulsive symptoms , and substance use disorders are highly prevalent in patients diagnosed with COVID - 19 [ 16 , 21 – 26 , 70 , 71 ] . The third possible expla - nation is that a major proportion of participants in the current study had experienced the post - COVID impair - ments , such as impairments in mental function , sensory functions and pain , and body system functions . These findings are in line with a previous study that showed that incidence of clinically significant mental health problems was higher in COVID - 19 - infected participants , and it was more prominent in those with post - COVID condi - tions [ 43 ] . Furthermore , there are a number of previous studies indicating co - occurrence between pain , physical health problems and mental health illness [ 72 – 74 ] . The final possible explanation is the timing of data collec - tion . Data for the current study was collected after the peak of the Omicron variant in Sweden , January 2022 , which increased COVID - 19 cases dramatically and tight - ened the restrictions . As a result , the rate of reinfection increased . In our sample , 19 % ( n = 99 ) of the participants reported that they had been infected for a second time and even a third time in January / February 2022 . Con - sidering possible explanations , we can safely say that individuals infected with COVID - 19 , especially those experiencing post - COVID impairments , are more likely to suffer from mental ill - health and may be more vulner - able for poor mental health outcomes . Looking at potential predictors , prior severity of COVID - 19 infection , post - COVID impairments and fatigue dimensions were associated with poor men - tal health outcomes and hospitalization because of Table 7 Results from hierarchical multiple regression analyses of depression , anxiety , and insomnia a Adjusted to exclude depression , anxiety , stress , or sleep problems Depression Anxiety Insomnia Block 1 ΔR2 = 0 . 144 , F = 16 . 08 , p < 0 . 001 ΔR2 = 0 . 071 , F = 7 . 46 , = 0 . 001 ΔR2 = 0 . 130 , F = 14 . 59 , p < 0 . 001 β p β p β p Severity of COVID‑19 infection 0 . 144 0 . 035 0 . 125 0 . 134 0 . 174 0 . 038 Hospitalization for COVID‑19 0 . 033 0 . 528 0 . 049 0 . 440 0 . 082 0 . 199 Block 2 ΔR2 = 0 . 165 , F = 11 . 14 , p < 0 . 001 ΔR2 = 0 . 119 , F = 7 . 003 , p < 0 . 001 ΔR2 = 0 . 062 , F = 3 . 67 , p = 0 . 007 Impairments in mental functions a 0 . 243 0 . 014 0 . 291 0 . 017 0 . 037 0 . 764 Impairments in sensory functions and pain 0 . 082 0 . 393 0 . 212 0 . 074 0 . 018 0 . 880 Impairments in body system functions 0 . 050 0 . 624 0 . 033 0 . 794 0 . 093 0 . 467 Impairments in activities and participation 0 . 054 0 . 519 0 . 142 0 . 165 0 . 128 0 . 219 Block 3 ΔR2 = 0 . 230 , F = 18 . 11 , p < 0 , 001 ΔR2 = 0 . 119 , F = 6 . 36 , p < 0 . 001 ΔR2 = 0 . 091 , F = 4 . 69 , p < 0 . 001 General fatigue 0 . 099 0 . 157 0 . 019 0 . 810 0 . 188 0 . 024 Physical fatigue 0 . 127 0 . 091 0 . 046 0 . 612 0 . 019 0 . 837 Reduced activity 0 . 016 0 . 843 0 . 115 0 . 247 0 . 177 0 . 077 Reduced motivation 0 . 448 < 0 . 001 0 . 395 < 0 . 001 0 . 286 < 0 . 001 Mental fatigue 0 . 010 0 . 897 0 . 019 0 . 841 0 . 036 0 . 713 Page 8 of 11 Badinlou et al . BMC Psychiatry ( 2022 ) 22 : 743 COVID - 19 was positively correlated with insomnia ( see Table 6 ) . These results are in line with previous studies showing high levels of mental health problems months after COVID - 19 recovery , and a more serious COVID - 19 infection in acute phase might be a risk factor for developing mental health illness [ 75 , 76 ] . In more detail , individuals infected with COVID - 19 showed the higher levels of mental health symptoms in the form of depres - sion , generalized anxiety , and post - traumatic stress [ 43 ] . In more recent studies , post - COVID condition is clearly linked to mental ill - health [ 43 , 76 , 77 ] . Multivariate analyses were used to estimate the unique variance accounted for in depression , anxiety , and insomnia scores . The block of COVID - 19 - related variables explained unique variance in depression and insomnia and severity of COVID - 19 infection appeared to contribute unique variance in depression and insom - nia . The block of post - COVID impairments explained unique variance in depression and anxiety . The results are consistent with previous study reporting higher lev - els of mental health problems in individuals with post - COVID conditions compared with individuals who had developed COVID - 19 without post - COVID conditions [ 43 ] . Looking at the importance of the separate variables within the set , impairments in mental functions appeared to contribute unique variance in depression and anxi - ety even we adjusted this variable to exclude depression , anxiety , stress , or sleep problems . It seems that impair - ments in mental functions such as impaired orientation , brain fatigue , concentration and attention difficulties , memory problem , and impaired organization and plan - ning might be a risk factor for poor mental health out - comes . The block of fatigue variables , including general fatigue , physical fatigue , reduced activity reduced moti - vation , and mental fatigue , contributed unique variance in all three mental health outcomes . We further found that reduced motivation was interestingly the strongest predictors of risk for poor outcomes in depression , anxi - ety and insomnia . In other words , lower levels of motiva - tion were associated with an increased risk of depression , anxiety , and insomnia symptoms . In the current study , motivation was assessed through four questions related to motivation dimension of the MFI - 20 including “I feel like doing all sorts of nice things” , “I dread having to do things” , “I have a lot of plans” , and “I don’t feel like doing anything” . One possible explanation relies in that con - stancy in the face of difficulties as occurred during the COVID - 19 pandemic is an important factor for lower wellbeing [ 78 ] . Life has been changed during the pan - demic and a wide range of difficulties has been constantly experienced by many people such as financial difficulty , loneliness , fear of illness with COVID - 19 , loss of work , difficulties acquiring medication , difficulties accessing food , threats to personal safety , and difficulties in social functioning [ 9 , 79 , 80 ] . Therefore , reduced motivation could be a result of mental health issues or / and the pan - demic period . Another possible explanation is that to stay motivated seems to play a key role for mental health outcomes in individuals infected with COVID - 19 . It has been nearly two years and a half since the COVID - 19 pandemic started . People are tired to cope with pan - demic and its consequences and demotivated to struggle with their post - COVID condition and improve their well - being beside the negative impacts on their life . Conclusion In conclusion , the current study outlines that individu - als with a history of probable or confirmed SARS CoV - 2 infection / infections are more likely to suffer from mental health problems . Therefore , policies are needed in order to promote and protect mental health in the individuals infected with COVID - 19 especially those who still have experienced post - COVID impairments . Implication The identified factors that contribute to the level of mental health problems can be used for screening pur - poses in order to provide interventions for individuals infected with COVID - 19 especially among those who still have experienced post - COVID condition . For exam - ple , the finding that reduced motivation was the strong - est predictor of poor mental health suggests that staying motivated seems to be a core component in individuals infected with COVID - 19 in order to manage their mental health . In the health care systems , the interventions tar - geting this group could use techniques like motivational interviewing in order to encourage patients to seek help , provide the initial motivation for treatment and increase likelihood of behavior changes [ 81 – 84 ] . Limitations and future directions There are several important limitations in the current study . First , using the cross - sectional design in this study did not enable us to interpret the findings as imply - ing causality . Longitudinal studies are needed to iden - tify how mental health outcomes change over time and the causal factors of changes . Second , we conducted this study on a convenience sample , which limits the gener - alizability of findings . Further studies are warranted to examine the mental health using more representative samples . Third , we gathered self - report data in this study . Self - report biases and poor recall should therefore be considered when interpreting the findings . Fourth , lack of baseline data related to mental health before infec - tion / infections did not enable us to examine confidently the impacts of post - COVID impairments and fatigue on Page 9 of 11 Badinlou et al . BMC Psychiatry ( 2022 ) 22 : 743 mental health outcome . Fifth , lack of a control group of non - COVID affected subjects did not enable us to assess the weight of COVID infection versus psychosocial fac - tors of the pandemic on mental health outcomes . Further studies are warranted to study mental ill health by com - paring COVID affected and non - COVID affected sub - jects . Finally , the findings that reduced motivation and impaired mental functions were the strong predictor of poor mental health outcomes in the current study raise the chicken - and - the - egg dilemma . Further studies are vital to address the bidirectional associations between motivation as well as cognitive functions and mental health outcomes in individuals infected with COVID - 19 especially those with post - COVID conditions .
