The identification of the molecules and mechanisms that allow these cellular processes to interface is vital for understanding cell behaviors . Ndel1 , the mammalian homolog of the Aspergillus nidulans NudE , organizes the cytoskeleton and regulates molecular motors , thereby impacting on the positioning of membranes . Hypothetically , Ndel1 can act in concert with enzymes controlling membrane trafficking ( vesicle - mediated transport ) per se , but this idea has never been investigated . We now report that a pool of Ndel1 associates directly with Dynamin 2 ( Dyn2 ) , a large cytosolic GTPase involved in the trafficking of the AMPA receptor subunit GluR1 . In vitro , Ndel1 enhances Dyn2 GTPase activity in its unassembled and assembled forms , without promoting oligomerization of the enzyme . In cells , gain and loss of function of Ndel1 recapitulate the effects of overexpression of Dyn2 and Dyn2 dominant negative with reduced GTPase activity on the intracellular localization of GluR1 , respectively , without affecting the stability of microtubules . Together , these results indicate that Ndel1 regulates Dyn2 GTPase activity and impacts GluR1 - containing membranes distribution in a manner reminiscent of Dyn2 .

Emerging evidence indicate that Ndel1 , a 345 amino - acid coiled - coil protein and the mammalian homolog of the Aspergillus nidulans NudE , organizes the cytoskeleton and regulates molecular motors in numerous cell types [ 1 – 7 ] . In mitotic cells , through association with MTs , Ndel1 ensures the assembly of the mitotic spindle , centrosomal maturation and mitosis [ 8 , 9 ] . During mitosis , Ndel1 also regulates the alignment and segregation of chromo - somes . In the developing neocortex , Ndel1 , in association with the Dynein motor and the lissencephaly protein Lis1 , contributes to neuronal migration [ 8 , 10 – 12 ] ( for a review on neuronal migration , refer to [ 13 ] ) . It does so by stabilizing MTs and promoting nucleokinesis , the process that pulls the nucleus toward the extending leading process of a migrating neuron [ 12 ] . In addition , Ndel1 can also influence actin organization and dynamics through interactions with Rho GTPases and Paxillin during cell migration and adhesion [ 14 – 17 ] . Finally , Ndel1 induces neuronal differen - tiation and maintains cell integrity of maturing neurons through polymerization of neuronal IFs ( neurofilaments ) transported by Dynein and Kinesin [ 1 , 18 , 19 ] . In each of these biological processes , Ndel1 not only plays a key role in maintaining structural integrity but also appears to position organelles and traffic membranes via MTs and molecular motors . For instance , Ndel1 participates in the positioning of Golgi membranes through the MTs / Lis1 / Dynein pathway [ 20 , 21 ] . Whether Ndel1 contrib - utes to membrane trafficking ( vesicle - mediated transport ) per se through other mechanisms such as by regulating proteins that shape membranes structure , remains however undefined . Dynamin ( Dyn ) is a large cytosolic GTPase ( , 100 kDa ) that was first isolated from the brain as a microtubule - binding protein , although little evidence points to a role for Dyn in MTs remodelling [ 22 ] . However , a recent study indicates that Dyn2 is involved in dynamic instability of MTs [ 23 ] . Dyns are most well characterized for their action on membranes . Dyn associates with membranes and through oligomerization into ring - like structures , wraps around the neck of budding vesicles [ 22 , 24 , 25 ] . Following hydrolysis of GTP , Dyn changes its conformation to constrict and PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 1 January 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 1 | e14583 pinch membranes [ 22 , 24 ] . A longitudinal tension appears to be required to pull apart the membranes and allow membrane fission during membrane trafficking in yeast , vertebrate and mammalian cells [ 25 – 27 ] . There are three isoforms of Dynamin : Dyn1 , Dyn2 and Dyn3 [ 22 , 28 ] . Whereas Dyn1 and Dyn3 are expressed in a tissue - specific manner , Dyn2 is ubiquitously expressed [ 29 ] . Dyn2 is enriched in clathrin - coated pits at the plasma membrane [ 30 ] . A very minor fraction of Dyn2 is presumably found at the trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) [ 31 , 32 ] . Dyns have also been linked to actin dynamics and implicated in calveolae internalization , vesicles recycling at the synapse , lamellipodia formation , cell migration and invasion [ 33 – 41 ] . In a yeast two - hybrid screen , we recovered Dyn2 as a Ndel1 - binding partner . We verified this interaction biochemically and molecularly . We also found that Ndel1 , like Dyn2 , impacts the intracellular distribution of the a´ - amino - 3 - hydroxyl - 5 - methyl - 4 - isoxazole - propionate ( AMPA ) receptor GluR1 , possibly through regulation of Dyn2 GTPase activity . Results Ndel1 interacts directly with Dynamin 2 In a yeast two - hybrid screen , we recovered Dyn2 as a Ndel1 - binding partner . To determine whether Dyn2 forms a complex with the MT - associated factor Ndel1 in cells , co - immunoprecip - itation experiments with Ndel1 antibodies were performed on HeLa cell lysates . As shown in Fig . 1A , Dyn2 co - immunoprecip - itated with Ndel1 as did Lis1 and Dynein . The association between Ndel1 and Dyn2 was also detected in neuroblastoma CAD cells , rat primary cultured hippocampal neurons and adult mouse cortex ( Fig . 1B ) . All co - immunoprecipitation experiments were controlled with the absence of antibodies or the presence of Myc antibodies . Using a post - mitochondrial fraction ( PMF ) , an intermediate fraction composed of cytosol , Golgi , endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) , endosomes and plasma membranes , we succeeded in co - immunoprecipitating Dyn2 with Ndel1 ( Fig . 1C ) . Taken together , these results indicate that Dyn2 forms a complex with Ndel1 in vivo . The direct interaction between Ndel1 and Dyn2 was demon - strated by an in vitro binding assay using purified His - Ndel1 and GST - Dyn2 fusion proteins . While GST protein did not associate with His - Ndel1 , GST - Dyn2 pulled down His - Ndel1 ( Fig . 1D ) . The direct interaction between the two proteins was further tested by Far - western assays . Incubation of GST - Dyn2 with membrane - bound His - Ndel1 revealed specific binding of Dyn2 to Ndel1 at the expected molecular weight ( , 45 kDa ) . The binding occurred in a dose - dependent manner , as increasing the amounts of His - Ndel1 ( 1 to 2 m g ) resulted in stronger signals with Dyn2 antibodies ( Fig . 1E ) . Lanes with no protein loaded did not exhibit immunoreactivity . In the reverse experiment , incubation of soluble His - Ndel1 protein with membrane - bound GST - Dyn2 verified the direct interaction between the two proteins ( Fig . 1E ) . Like other Dynamins , Dyn2 is composed of a GTPase domain , a middle domain , critical for tetramerization and high - order self - assembly , a Pleckstrin Homology domain ( PH ) for membrane association , a GTPase Effector Domain ( GED ) that acts as an intramolecular GTPase Activating Protein ( GAP ) and a Proline - Rich Domain ( PRD ) that varies among members of the Dyn family and indirectly promotes cell signalling through association with various protein partners bearing SH3 domains [ 22 ] . To map the domain ( s ) of interaction between Ndel1 and Dyn2 , recombi - nant His - Ndel1 and truncated GST fragments of Dyn2 were expressed and purified for in vitro binding assays ( Fig . 2A ) . The GTPase domain , the middle domain , the PH and GED domains , but not the PRD of Dyn2 interacted with His - Ndel1 ( Fig . 2B ) . The F5 construct containing all three binding sites bound less to Ndel1 than the individual F1 - F3 constructs suggesting possible confor - mational changes in Dyn2 and / or competition between multiple binding sites . To map the interaction domain ( s ) on Ndel1 , N - terminus ( a . a . 1 – 201 ) , C - terminus ( a . a . 191 – 345 ) or full length ( a . a . 1 – 345 ) Flag - Ndel1 constructs were transfected in HeLa cells and co - immunoprecipitation experiments were performed with Flag antibody . The C - terminus and full length Ndel1 , but not the N - terminus , interacted with endogenous Dyn2 ( Fig . 2C ) . This Ndel1 tail / Dyn2 direct interaction was confirmed by yeast two - hybrid assays ( Fig . 2D ) . Together , these results indicate that the C - terminus of Ndel1 is sufficient for direct interaction with Dyn2 , possibly with all domains excluding the PRD . Ndel1 enhances Dynamin 2 GTPase activity in vitro The above findings showing that Ndel1 binds to Dyn2 through its regulatory domains including the GTPase domain ( Figs . 2A , 2B ) raised the question as to whether Ndel1 regulates Dyn2 GTPase activity . To test whether Ndel1 modulates Dyn2 activity , we performed two different in vitro GTPase assays . Previous studies have shown that Dyn2 activity is stimulated by oligomer - ization of the enzyme [ 22 , 42 , 43 ] . Based on these reports , we reconstituted Dyn2 oligomers in vitro under low salt conditions and measured the GTPase activity upon addition of GTP and in the presence or absence of Ndel1 ( see Materials and Methods ) . We found that addition of Ndel1 to the reaction mixture enhanced the hydrolysis of GTP into GDP by , 2 fold , in a time - dependent manner ( Fig . 3A ) . In this radioactive assay , Ndel1 itself did not exhibit any GTPase activity ( Fig . 3A ) . Using a non - radioactive assay we further confirmed that Ndel1 augments the GTPase activity of assembled Dyn2 ( Fig . 3B ) . Consistent with data obtained with the radioactive assay , we also confirmed that Ndel1 shows no detectable intrinsic activity ( Fig . 3B ) . Phospholipase D ( PLD ) , an activator of Dyn2 GTPase activity , and high salt conditions that disassemble Dyn2 oligomers , were used as positive and negative controls , respectively ( Fig . 3B and [ 43 , 44 ] ) . Interestingly , even under high salt conditions , we found that Ndel1 significantly augments Dyn2 basal activity ( Fig . 3B and see below ) . Taken together , these results indicate that Ndel1 enhances the GTPase activity of unassembled and assembled Dyn2 . The F1 and F5 fragments of Dyn2 contain the GTPase domain , and the GTPase + middle + PH + GED domains , respectively . Both fragments have detectable activity ( Fig . 3C ) . We further tested whether Ndel1 impacts the activity of F1 and F5 . We found that Ndel1 enhances the activity of F5 by , 1 . 3 fold . This increase in activity is within the same magnitude as the augmentation observed with the full length protein ( Figs . 3B , 3C ) . Remarkably , Ndel1’s effect was maintained when oligomerization of F5 was prevented under high salt conditions ( Fig . 3C ) . In contrast to F5 and Dyn2 full length , F1 , which cannot oligomerize , did not display detectable levels of activity ( Fig . 3C + [ 44 ] ) . However , the addition of Ndel1 or PLD ( positive control ) elevated the GTPase activity to detectable levels . Thus , our data confirmed the existence of a low intrinsic activity of the GTPase domain ( F1 ) that can be stimulated by PLD [ 44 ] , and revealed that Ndel1 can also increase this activity . In sum , these results indicate that Ndel1 can augment the basal ( unassembled ) and oligomeric ( assembled ) GTPase activity of Dyn2 in vitro . Ndel1 decreases the oligomerization of Dynamin 2 We found that Ndel1 increases the GTPase activity of Dyn2 in its oligomeric form . We also made the observation that Ndel1 Ndel1 Regulates Dyn2 Activity PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 2 January 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 1 | e14583 counteracts the decrease in activity caused by high salt conditions and we attributed this to an enhancement in basal activity . However , Dyn2 self - assembly per se has been proposed as a major regulator of its GTPase activity [ 43 ] . Since Ndel1 binds the middle domain of Dyn2 , which is important for its oligomerization , it is possible that Ndel1 facilitates Dyn2 oligomerization . To determine whether Ndel1 facilitates Dyn2 self - assembly in vitro , Dyn2 oligomers were assembled in vitro in the presence or absence of Ndel1 . The complexes were analyzed by a sedimentation assay that separates Dyn2 oligomers in the pellet ( P ) from unassembled Dyn2 in the supernatant ( S ) after centrifugation . Using this assay , , 70 % of Dyn2 sedimented ( Fig . 4 ) . Incubation of Ndel1 with non - assembled Dyn2 did not enhance the amount of Dyn2 recovered in the pellet ( Fig . 4 ) . In fact , at the opposite , a significantly lower Figure 1 . Interaction between Ndel1 and Dyn2 .

These results indicate that Ndel1 decreases Dyn2 oligomerization . They are consistent with the findings that Ndel1 enhances Dyn2 GTPase activity ( GTP hydrolysis ) ( Fig . 3 ) and GTP hydrolysis stimulates Dyn2 disassembly [ 43 ] . The data also confirmed that the Ndel1 - mediated increase in Dyn2 activity under high salt conditions ( Fig . 3B ) is not related to a facilitation of Dyn2 oligomerization but rather to an increase in basal activity . Ndel1 mimics the effects of Dynamin 2 on GluR1 intracellular localization We have shown that Ndel1 interacts with Dyn2 and regulates its GTPase activity in vitro . Considering that Dyn2 regulates intracellular trafficking [ 31 , 32 ] and endocytosis of the AMPA receptor subunit GluR1 [ 45 , 46 ] , we propose that Ndel1 may regulate GluR1 intracellular distribution in a similar way to Dyn2 . To verify this hypothesis , we compared the effects of exogenous Ndel1 , exogenous Dyn2 , Ndel1 siRNA and mutant Dyn2 with reduced GTPase activity ( Dyn2 ( K44A ) ) [ 45 – 47 ] on GluR1 distribution in HeLa cells , by membrane fractionation . Our rationale is that Ndel1’s gain of function would mimic the effects of exogenous Dyn2 on GluR1 localization , while loss of function of Ndel1 would recapitulate the effects of Dyn2 ( K44A ) . Heavy membrane and light membrane fractions from the five groups of transfected cells were separated by velocity sucrose gradient ( see Materials and Methods ) . This method of fraction - ation is not selective to specific organelles , as shown in Fig . 5A , but provides the general information on the localization of GluR1 in the presence or absence of functional Ndel1 or Dyn2 . When expressed at low levels , GluR1 is normally found at the cell periphery ( Fig . 5C ) . As shown in Fig . 5B , the overexpression of Ndel1 reduced the ratio of GluR1 in heavy membranes vs total levels of GluR1 ( heavy membranes + light membranes = 100 % ) in a manner reminiscent of cells overexpressing Dyn2 , when compared to cells transfected with an empty vector . These results indicate that GluR1 localization is similarly affected in the presence of an excess of Ndel1 or Dyn2 , the total amount of GTPase activity being higher in these cells . Conversely , the expression of the dominant negative Dyn2 ( K44A ) with reduced GTPase activity enhanced the ratio GluR1 ( heavy membranes ) / GluR1 ( total levels ) ( Fig . 5B ) . Remarkably , depletion of Ndel1 by siRNA also increased the ratio GluR1 ( heavy membranes ) / GluR1 ( total levels ) . The impaired localization of GluR1 in Ndel1 siRNA - Figure 2 .

This alteration was unlikely caused by destabilization and collapse of the MT network as levels of acetylated - Tubulin ( Ac - Tubulin : stable MTs ) and MT structures remain essentially unchanged in Ndel1 - depleted cells ( Fig . 5B and references [ 1 , 4 ] ) . Nor was it caused by remodelling or fragmentation of the TGN or endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) as revealed by the fractionation profiles of the KDEL ER marker and TGN marker p230 trans - Golgi in the heavy and light membrane fractions , and their staining pattern in these Ndel1 - depleted cells ( Fig . S1 ) . To further confirm the changes in GluR1 intracellular localization , we stained HeLa cells co - transfected with GluR1 at low levels and control siRNA . In these cells , GluR1 was distributed properly throughout the cell body and cell periphery ( Fig . 5C ) . In contrast , in GluR1 - expressing cells depleted of Ndel1 , GluR1 mostly accumulated in perinuclear regions , with very little proteins transported to the periphery ( Fig . 5C ) . Taken together , these results support the notion that Ndel1 regulates GluR1 intracellular localization in a similar fashion to Dyn2 . As loss of Ndel1 function mimics the effects of Dyn2 ( K44A ) with reduced activity , these results combined with the in vitro GTPase assays suggest that Ndel1 may in part positively regulate Dyn2 GTPase activity to impact GluR1 localization . Discussion We have discovered that Ndel1 is a novel regulator of the basal ( unassembled ) and assembled Dyn2 GTPase activity , and impacts the intracellular localization of one of Dyn2 targets , the AMPA receptor subunit GluR1 . Whether Ndel1 regulates GluR1 distribution through control of Dyn2 GTPase during trafficking and / or organelles remodelling ( changes in positioning / morphol - ogy ) remains to be determined . Ndel1 is not a typical GAP The GTPase Effector Domain ( GED ) of Dyns favors self - assembly and consequently , acts as an intramolecular GTPase Activating Protein ( GAP ) to enhance the GTPase activity of Dyn2 [ 48 ] . Several molecules such as Grb2 can indirectly stimulate the GTPase activity of Dyns by promoting self - assembly through the GED domain . In 2006 , the first ‘‘external’’ GAP , Phospholipase D ( PLD ) , acting directly on the active and assembled Dyns was identified [ 23 , 42 , 44 ] . Like other GAPs that use an arginine finger - based mechanism for activation , the PHOX homology domain of PLD contains two arginine residues essential for the GAP function . Consistent with the mechanism of other GAPs , the PHOX homology domain of PLD also interacts with the GTPase domain of Dyns in its GTP - bound state . Our biochemical experiments indicate that Ndel1 binds to the GTPase domain of Dyn2 . Using in vitro radioactive and non - radioactive GTPase assays , we found that Ndel1 enhances the GTPase activity of Dyn2 in its unassembled and assembled states by a mechanism independent of the oligomerization of the enzyme . In cells , Ndel1 depletion by siRNA also mimics the effects of Dyn2 ( K44A ) , a mutant with reduced GTPase activity , while overexpression of Ndel1 impacts on GluR1 distribution in a similar way to enhancing Dyn2 activity . These results suggest that Ndel1 may regulate GluR1 intracellular distribution through Dyn2 GTPase activity . It remains unclear which of the two ( unassembled or assembled ) Dyn2 GTPase activities is regulated by Ndel1 in cells . Interestingly , the interaction between Ndel1 and Dyn2 is GTP - independent ( data not shown ) and Ndel1 does not exhibit a PHOX homology domain . Thus , we propose that Ndel1 may act on Dyn2 in a different way than a typical GAP . Taking in consideration the relatively small molecular weight of Ndel1 , its binding to all domains ( GTPase , middle , PH and GED ) except the PRD of Dyn2 suggests that it may adopt a particular conformation for interaction . The crystal structure of the Dyn2 / Ndel1 interfaces will help define the mechanism of this novel activator . Figure 4 . Ndel1 decreases oligomerization of Dyn2 .

( B ) The framed Western blots depict the separation of GluR1 in HM vs GluR1 in LM in HeLa cells . Increasing the levels of Dyn2 or Ndel1 reduces the ratio GluR1 HM / GluR1 ( HM + LM ) , indicating GluR1 is redistributed from the heavy membranes Ndel1 Regulates Dyn2 Activity PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 7 January 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 1 | e14583 How does Ndel1 regulates GluR1 distribution ? Our membrane fractionation experiments indicate that Ndel1 impacts the intracellular localization of GluR1 in a similar way to Dyn2 . In cells overexpressing or lacking Ndel1 , the ER and TGN distribution remain unaffected ( Fig . S1 ) . Thus , it is unlikely that the Ndel1 siRNA - mediated redistribution of GluR1 is due to remodelling of these organelles [ 20 ] . However , we cannot exclude the possibility that Ndel1 affects the positioning and morphology of organelles other than the ER and TGN . It should also be noted that Dyn2 affects TGN biology as shown on Fig . S1C [ 31 ] but it is unknown whether this contributes to the redistribution of GluR1 in cells through a Ndel1 - independent mechanism . As a third non - mutually exclusive scenario based on the interactions data , in vitro GTPase assays and comparative studies with Ndel1 siRNA and dominant negative Dyn2 , we speculate that Ndel1 , by regulating Dyn2 GTPase activity , could modulate the trafficking , i . e . vesicle - mediated transport , of GluR1 . This speculative model finds support in the literature . Indeed , by virtue of its interactions with Dyn2 ( this study ) , cytosolic proteins involved in membrane morphogenesis such as a COP [ 4 ] , cytoskeletal proteins and molecular motors [ 2 , 3 , 12 , 49 , 50 ] , Ndel1 would be a candidate of choice to integrate cytoskeleton dynamics and membrane fission during membrane trafficking . On the one hand , by increasing Dyn2 GTPase activity , Ndel1 could help the cytosolic enzyme to constrict membranes and sever GluR1 - containing vesicles from heavy membranes . On the other hand , Ndel1 and Dyn2 have been linked to actin [ 14 – 17 , 34 – 36 , 38 , 39 ] and Ndel1 can modulate actin organization and dynamics to provide the longitudinal tension necessary to pull apart membranes during fission [ 25 ] . Such longitudinal force has already been suggested in yeast in the form of localized actin polymerization at the site of endocytosis at the plasma membrane [ 27 , 51 , 52 ] . Alternatively , by regulating Dynein and Kinesin activities through Lis1 [ 5 , 7 , 12 , 49 , 50 , 53 ] and by activating the walking of soluble molecular motors on MTs , Ndel1 could generate a similar longitudinal force through MTs . Ndel1 could also facilitate the polymerization of MTs to extend this force . This idea of longitudinal force generated by MTs / Dyn2 / Ndel1 would be compatible with a recent study reporting that Dyn2 also controls MTs stability [ 23 ] . Furthermore , a vesicles population with both Dynein and Kinesin I bound that may be capable of bi - directional motility along MTs has been described [ 49 ] . Further studies are required to test this appealing speculative model of dual ( constrictive and longitudinal ) forces involving Ndel1 / Dyn2 / MTs and active transport of Dyn2 in mammalian cells . Ndel1 and other cellular functions associated with Dynamins We have focused our study on the full length Dyn2 due to its ubiquitous nature in context of GluR1 trafficking . As a centrosomal protein , Ndel1 may participate in centrosome cohesion via binding to Dyn2 and gamma - Tubulin [ 40 ] . The Dyn family contains 3 members ( Dyn1 , Dyn2 , Dyn3 ) expressed in a tissue - specific manner [ 22 ] . The alternative splicing sites in the Dynamin gene further increase the diversity of Dyn proteins in cells . So far , more than 20 Dyn isoforms have been reported [ 54 ] . Therefore , Ndel1 may also interact with other Dyn members and isoforms to control cellular functions such as clathrin - mediated receptor endocytosis , calveolae internalization , vesicles recycling at the synapse and lamellipodia formation [ 33 – 39 , 41 ] . Finally , Ndel1 has been extensively studied in regards to its essential role in brain development and maturation . Its association with the MT - associated factors Lis1 and DISC - 1 ( the lissencephaly and schizophrenia - causing proteins , respectively ) , has incriminated it as a potential candidate in developmental and neuropsychiatric disorders . The findings that Ndel1 acts on the functions of intermediate filament protein NF - L [ 1 ] and Dyn2 ( this study ) , both mutated in the sensory motor neurodegenerative Charcot - Marie - Tooth disease [ 55 – 58 ] further highlight his key role in degener - ating neurons . Thus , investigation of the roles of Ndel1 / Dyn complex in nerve cells will provide a better understanding of the importance of cytoskeleton / membrane interface in the healthy and diseased nervous system . Materials and Methods Immunoprecipitations Cells were lysed in lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris – HCl at pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl , 10 mM KCl , 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 5 % NP40 , 0 . 5 % Tween - 20 containing a protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche Diagnostics ) ) by sonication . Supernatants were incubated with appropriate antibodies and the resulting immune complexes were washed 4 times with lysis buffer , separated by SDS – PAGE and immunoblotted . Far - western and in vitro pull - down assays Far - western assays were performed with affinity - purified GST - fused Dyn2 and His - tagged Ndel1 proteins . GST - fused Dyn2 ( M r of , 130 kDa ) and His - tagged Ndel1 ( M r of , 45 kDa ) proteins were expressed in BL - 21 Escherichia coli ( Stratagene ) cells and purified on a Glutathione Sepharose 4 Fast Flow column ( GE Healthcare ) or Ni - NTA Agarose column ( Qiagen ) according to the manufacturer’s protocol . The in vitro pull - down assays of the GST - fused Dyn2 and His - tagged Ndel1 were carried out with Glutathione Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads or Ni - NTA Agarose beads in 500 m L of binding buffer containing 20 mM HEPES , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM DTT , a protease inhibitor cocktail and 0 . 1 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) at 4 u C for 2 hours . Yeast two - hybrid assays Dyn2 full length isoform was amplified by PCR and inserted into the Sal I and Not I sites of pPC86 vector ( GAL4 - activation - domain ) ( Invitrogen ) . Full - length ( a . a . 1 – 345 ) , coiled - coil domain ( a . a . 1 – 201 ) and carboxyl tail ( a . a . 191 – 345 ) of Ndel1 were cloned into pPC97 vector ( GAL4 - DNA - binding - domain ) . MaV203 yeast cells were co - transformed with various constructs of pPC97 and pPC86 vectors . Colonies grown on SD - Leu / Trp media were streaked onto a YPD ( yeast peptone dextrose ) plate and colony - lifting assays for b - galactosidase expression were carried out according to the manufacturer’s instructions ( Clontech ) . Also , transformants were plated on SD - Leu / Trp / His media , containing 20 mM or 40 mM 3 - amino - 1 , 2 , 4 - triazol ( 3 - AT ) and incubated for 5 days at 30 u C . to the lighter membranes . The usage of a dominant negative mutant of Dyn2 ( Dyn2 ( K44A ) ) or the treatment of cells with Ndel1 siRNA reverts the ratio , indicating accumulating GluR1 in the HM fraction . ‘‘C’’ corresponds to control ( cells transfected with an empty vector ) . Error bars indicate s . d . ( n = 3 ) . One way ANOVA : * * * , p , 0 . 001 ; * * , p , 0 . 01 ; * , p , 0 . 05 . Note that the levels of stable ( acetylated ) Tubulin are similar in Ndel1 siRNA - treated cells vs control siRNA - treated cells . ( C ) In HeLa cells treated with control siRNA , the AMPA receptor GluR1 ( red ) is found at the cell periphery and up to the cell edge . In HeLa cells treated with Ndel1 siRNA most of GluR1 ( red ) is found close to the nucleus with very little amount at the cell periphery . Cells were double stained with a marker for the trans - Golgi network ( p230 trans - Golgi , blue ) .

For the transfection and transient expression of proteins ( Dyn2 - GFP , Dyn2 ( K44A ) - GFP , Flag - tagged Ndel1 , GluR1 and ER - mCherry ( see below ) ) , cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . HeLa cells were transfected with synthetic siRNAs ( 25 – 100 nM , duplexes ) specific for Ndel1 ( 5 9 - GCAGGUCUCAGUGUUAGAA - 3 9 ) by using HiPerfect transfection reagent ( Qiagen ) according to the manu - facturer’s instructions and then cultured for 24 hours or 48 hours to achieve Ndel1 silencing . Allstars negative control siRNA duplexes ( Qiagen ) were used as a control . The molar ratios of GluR1 construct to other DNA constructs or Ndel1 siRNAs for co - transfection were 1 : 1 for biochemical analyses . For ER structure experiments , HeLa cells were co - transfected with ER - mCherry and control or Ndel1 siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 . The total number of cells analyzed for classifications of described ER phenotypes exceeded 200 for control siRNA - treated cells and 450 for Ndel1 siRNA - treated cells . Immunocytochemistry Briefly , HeLa cells were fixed for 20 minutes in warm PBS with 4 % paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0 . 5 % saponin . They were incubated in 10 % goat serum ( 2 . 5 hours , 25 u C ) , appropriate primary antibody in PBS with 3 % BSA , 0 . 5 % saponin ( overnight , 4 u C ) and secondary antibody in PBS with 3 % BSA , 0 . 5 % saponin ( 2 hours , 25 u C ) . The immunofluorescent staining was performed with GluR1 ( Chemicon International ) , Ndel1 ( custom - made ) and p230 trans - Golgi ( BD Biosciences ) antibodies . For ER staining , cells were transfected with an ER - targeted fluorophore , ER - mCherry , produced using variations of previously reported methods [ 59 , 60 ] . PCR primers complementary to the mCherry sequence of the mCherry vector in pcDNA 3 . 1 ( + ) ( a generous gift from Dr Michael A Colicos ) were used to amplify the mCherry sequence and add a BamH I restriction site on 5 9 end and the KDEL ER retention signal plus EcoR I restriction site on 3 9 end . An ER targeting peptide , corresponding to the 17 initial amino acids of Calreticulin was synthesized and Nhe I and BamH I restrictions sites were added on 5 9 and 3 9 end respectively . Both inserts were further ligated between the Nhe I and EcoR I restriction sites of the pcDNA 3 . 1 ( + ) ( Invitrogen ) under control of the CMV promoter . Confocal images were captured with a Nikon Eclipse C1 laser and detector units mounted on a Nikon Eclipse TE2000 - E microscope with a 60X 1 . 40 oil objective using EZ - C1 3 . 50 imaging software . Post - mitochondrial fractions preparation Briefly , post - mitochondrial fractions ( PMF ) from HeLa cells were isolated using a series of centrifugations and homogeniza - tion / resuspension in hypotonic / isotonic extraction buffers ( for additional details , see the manufacturer’s protocol for isolation kit ER0100 ; Sigma - Aldrich ) . The PMF is the source of ER microsomes and is also enriched in plasma membrane , Golgi membranes and small vesicles / endosomes membranes ( Fig . 1C ) . The PMF was examined by Western blot analysis using Tubulin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , p230 trans - Golgi , EEA1 ( BD Biosciences ) , Na + / K + ATPase ( Upstate ) , BiP and KDEL ER marker ( Santa Cruz Biotechnologies ) antibodies . Preparation of heavy and light membrane fractions by velocity sucrose gradient centrifugation The preparation was performed according to reference [ 61 ] . Briefly , 2 6 10 7 cultured HeLa cells transfected with or without Dyn2 - GFP , Dyn2 ( K44A ) - GFP , Flag - tagged Ndel1 , Ndel1 siRNA and GluR1 constructs were washed twice with ice - cold PBS and re - suspended in 0 . 5 mL ice - cold Homogenization Buffer ( 0 . 2 M sucrose , 10 mM HEPES , 1 mM EDTA , protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche Diagnostics ) pH 7 . 4 ) . The nuclei and unbroken cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1 , 000 6 g for 10 minutes after homogenization . The supernatant ( , 1 mL ) was loaded onto a 0 . 2 M to 1 . 2 M linear sucrose gradient and centrifuged at 25 , 000 r . p . m . in a Beckman rotor ( SW41 ) for 15 minutes ( after reaching the final speed ) . Five millilitres from the top of the gradient were collected as the light membrane fraction ( LM ) . Four millilitres from the bottom of the gradient were collected as the heavy membrane fraction ( HM ) . The collected fractions were subjected to buffer change by ice - cold Homogenization Buffer without sucrose and concentrated by an Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter device ( Millipore ) . All steps were carried out at 4 u C . Dynamin 2 GTPase assays Radioactive GTPase assays were conducted in Assay buffer ( 10 mM HEPES , 10 mM PIPES , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 1 mM DTT at pH 7 . 0 , 0 . 1 % BSA ) containing 0 . 5 mM GTP in a final volume of 20 m L . Bacterially - expressed Dyn2 ( 1 . 5 m M ) was preincubated with or without purified His - Ndel1 protein for 30 minutes at room temperature . Reactions were initiated by adding GTP spiked with 0 . 5 m Ci a - 32 P - GTP and incubated at 37 u C . Aliquots ( 1 . 5 m L ) were removed at specified times and spotted onto polyethyleneimine ( PEI ) cellulose thin - layer chro - matography ( TLC ) plates ( Scientific Absorbents Incorporated ) . Nucleotides were resolved by thin layer chromatography in 1 : 1 ratio of 1 M LiCl : 2 M formic acid solution . The TLC plates were dried in a warm air drier and autoradiographed with HyBlot CL film ( Denville Scientific Inc . ) for 4 hours at 2 80 u C . GTP and GDP levels were quantified using the Labscan program ( Image Master , 2D software v3 . 10 ; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) . Percentages of GTP hydrolysis were calculated for a minimum of three time points , and were defined as ( GDP / ( GTP + GDP ) ) 6 100 . Alternatively , the non - radioactive ELIPA GTPase assay ( Cyto - skeleton , Inc . ) was used in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions . Bacterially - expressed Dyn2 constructs ( 0 . 8 m M ) were preincubated with or without purified Ndel1 ( 1 . 5 m M ) in Assay Buffer ( 10 mM HEPES , 10 mM PIPES , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 1 mM DTT at pH 7 . 0 , 0 . 1 % BSA ) for 20 minutes at 37 u C . Reactions were initiated by adding 1 . 5 mM GTP and incubated at 37 u C . OD 360 nm was measured at regular intervals using a SpectraMax Plus 384 ( Molecular Devices ) for 60 minutes . This assay evaluates GTPase activity by assessing the amount of inorganic phosphate ( Pi ) generated through GTP hydrolysis . Sedimentation assay Dyn2 self - assembly with or without Ndel1 was tested by sedimentation after high - speed centrifugation . Dyn2 ( 2 m M ) with or without Ndel1 ( 2 m M ) was incubated in 10 mM HEPES , 10 mM PIPES , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 1 mM DTT at pH 7 . 0 , 0 . 5 mM GTP in a final volume of 50 m L at 37 u C for 15 minutes . Mixtures were then spun at 16 , 000 r . p . m . ( 20 , 800 6 g ) for 20 minutes in a microfuge refrigerated at 4 u C to obtain supernatant ( S ) and pellet ( P ) fractions . The pellet fraction was resuspended in 50 m L of the same buffer to obtain equal volumes of supernatant and pellet fractions . Samples were heated at 95 u C for 5 minutes after addition of 10 m L of 6 X SDS – PAGE buffer , resolved on a 8 % polyacrylamide gel and visualized by Coomassie staining .

( A ) Confocal pictures of HeLa cells transfected with a control siRNA or Ndel1 siRNA and stained for Ndel1 and p230 trans - Golgi , a protein associated with the trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) .

( B ) Confocal pictures of HeLa cells transfected with a control siRNA or Ndel1 siRNA and co - transfected with a construct encoding an endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) - targeted fluorophore ( ER - mCherry ) . The three upper panels represent the three ER phenotypes observed in both treatments : perinuclear , partially dispersed and fully dispersed ER . The bar graph shows the distribution of ER phenotypes among cells . Note that the distribution of the ER , labelled with the ER - mCherry remains largely unchanged in Ndel1 siRNA - transfected cells when compared to control siRNA - transfected cells . The bar graph reports the results of one experiment and is representative of the data found in 3 independent experiments . Chi - square analysis . ns , not significant . Scale bar , 10 m m . ( C ) Analysis by Western blots of the content of the KDEL ER marker and TGN marker p230 trans - Golgi in the light and heavy membrane fractions ( LM and HM respectively ) isolated from cells overexpressing GluR1 together with either Dyn2 , a mutant inactive form of Dyn2 ( Dyn2 ( K44A ) ) , Ndel1 , or depleted of Ndel1 by siRNA . Note that Ndel1 does not affect the distribution of the KDEL ER marker and TGN marker among the fractions : p230 is for instance mostly found in the HM fraction of cells overexpressing or lacking Ndel1 in a similar way to untransfected control cells . Dyn2 , which is important for TGN biology affects p230 trans - Golgi fractionation [ 31 ] but not KDEL ER marker distribution . On the contrary , the inactive Dyn2 ( K44A ) mutant does not affect p230 trans - Golgi distribution .
