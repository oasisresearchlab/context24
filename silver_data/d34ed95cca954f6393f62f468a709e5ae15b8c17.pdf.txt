Article Immunology Find the latest version : http : / / jci . me / 18937 - pdf The Journal of Clinical Investigation | December 2003 | Volume 112 | Number 11 1707 Introduction B cell development is achieved with sequential and combined effects of participating molecules . B - line - age commitment from common lymphoid progeni - tors is initiated with a transcription factor , PAX5 , which presumably suppresses differentiation toward other lineages ( 1 – 3 ) . EBF and E2A are two other B lin - eage – specific transcription factors that work at an early developmental stage ( 4 , 5 ) . At a later develop - mental stage , the pre - B receptor complex and its related molecules SYK , BLNK , and BTK are indis - pensable for B cell development ( 6 – 11 ) . Interactions with intrinsic factors within the cells have not yet been fully revealed . Humoral factors derived from the hematopoietic microenvironment are also significant for B cell development during early and late develop - mental stages ( 12 ) : stromal cell – derived factor - 1 is indispensable in both humans and mice ( 13 , 14 ) , while IL - 7 is essential in mice ( 15 ) but not in humans ( 16 , 17 ) . In addition , bone marrow stromal cells play significant roles via contact with B - precursor cells as well as secretion of humoral factors such as the cytokines and chemokines mentioned above . Howev - er , the majority of participating molecules residing on stromal cells still remain undetermined . Agammaglobulinemia is a congenital syndrome characterized by a defect of B cells with preserved T cell function . This syndrome seems to be caused by abnormalities of molecules involved in B cell devel - opment and / or proliferation . The molecules respon - sible for the syndrome are therefore presumed to be intrinsic factors acting within or on B - precursor cells , or factors residing in the microenvironment that sup - port B cell development . Thus , their delineation will contribute to a further understanding of the B cell ontogeny . The most common cause of agammaglob - ulinemia is a defect of the BTK gene ( 18 , 19 ) . Muta - tions of the BTK gene are found in approximately 80 % of patients with agammaglobulinemia ( 20 ) .

However , such abnormal - ities are displayed in a minority of cases , and patho - genesis remains unresolved in the remainder . Thus , other unknown molecules essential for development and / or proliferation of B cells probably exist ( 21 ) . A girl with agammaglobulinemia and minor facial anomalies lacked B cells in peripheral blood . Kary - otypic analysis of her white blood cells showed a bal - anced chromosomal translocation , t ( 9 ; 20 ) ( q33 . 2 ; q12 ) . Expression of BTK in her white blood cells was unaf - fected , and all other previously mentioned molecules known to be responsible for agammaglobulinemia were not located on the translocation site . In the cur - rent study , we isolated a novel gene , leucine - rich repeat – containing 8 ( LRRC8 ) , and its truncated form that resulted from the chromosomal translocation . Transfer of the truncated gene into murine hematopoietic stem cells inhibited B cell develop - ment . Our data indicate that LRRC8 plays a signifi - cant role in B cell development , thereby adding a novel candidate to the group of molecules essential for B cell development . Methods Patient . A 17 - year - old girl with congenital agamma - globulinemia lacked B lymphocytes in peripheral blood and showed epicanthic folds , mild hyper - telorism , high - arched palate , and lowered ears ; no family member exhibited immunodeficiency . The absolute count of her peripheral lymphocytes was 3 , 300 per microliter , and the proportions of CD20 - , CD2 - , CD4 - , and CD8 - positive lymphocytes were 0 . 6 % , 97 . 0 % , 56 . 0 % , and 34 . 7 % , respectively . G - band - ed chromosomal analysis of her leukocytes showed 46 , XX , t ( 9 ; 20 ) ( q33 . 2 ; q12 ) , de novo , i . e . , her parents had no chromosomal abnormality . Informed consent was obtained from the patient and her parents . Isolation of the LRRC8 gene . For FISH analysis , we chose bacterial artificial chromosome ( BAC ) and P1 - derived artificial chromosome ( PAC ) clones on the long arm of chromosome 20 based on the Contig map from the Sanger Centre and the physical map of GeneMap’99 from the National Center for Biotech - nology Information , both purchased from BACPAC Resources ( Oakland , California , USA ) . FISH analysis was performed in a commercial clinical laboratory . The ET1033 probe was a PCR product amplified with primers ET1033s and ET1033a . Inverse PCR involved genomic DNA digestion with BamHI and BglII with self - ligation using T4 DNA ligase , followed by PCR amplification with an inverse pair of primers on chromosome 20 to uncover the mutation of der20 ( 22 ) . For cycle sequencing , templates were labeled with Terminator Ready Reaction Mix , and cDNA sequences were read with an ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer ( Applied Biosystems Applera Corp . , Foster City , Utah , USA ) . mRNAs were isolated from periph - eral mononuclear cells obtained from the patient and healthy donors . The primers for RT - PCR were NG1044 on exon 1 and PH221 on exon 2 for wild - type , and NG459 on exon 1 and TWIN2 on chromo - some 20 for mutant . Detection of the LRRC8 protein . Rabbit polyclonal antibodies ( poAbs ) against amino acids 342 – 589 of human LRRC8 were made by a commercial laborato - ry and used as primary antibodies for Western blot or flow cytometry analysis . The poAb’s also reacted with the murine ortholog . We carried out Western blot analysis using an HRP - conjugated donkey anti - rab - bit antibody as a secondary antibody , and ECL West - ern Blotting Detection Kit ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech , Piscataway , New Jersey , USA ) . For flow cytometry analysis ( FACSCalibur ; Becton Dickinson and Co . , Franklin Lakes , New Jersey , USA ) , cells were preincubated with goat serum and then incubated with the poAb’s against LRRC8 . After several washes , stained cells were reacted with a phycoerythrin - con - jugated goat anti - rabbit Ig antibody ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , Missouri , USA ) . Lineage - specific mAb’s ( Becton Dickinson and Co . ) used in this study were as follows : murine granulocytes , Gr - 1 ; monocytes , Mac - 1 ; T cells , CD3 ; and human and murine B - line - age cells , CD19 and B220 , respectively . Preparation of the retroviral vectors MIY and MutY . MIY is a mock vector , and MutY is a vector producing a truncated form of the LRRC8 protein . The truncated form of the LRRC8 gene was synthesized by PCR amplification using an NF9 and AIN2 primer pair . Ecotropic Phoenix packaging cells ( 23 ) were trans - fected with MIY or MutY using a calcium phosphate coprecipitation method ( 24 ) . After 24 - hour culture , medium was replaced with DMEM supplemented with 20 % FBS , and removed supernatant containing virus was cleansed by passage through a 0 . 20 - µ m syringe filter and frozen at – 80°C until use . This pro - cedure was repeated two more times every 24 hours . Gene transfer and bone marrow transplantation . Three milligrams of 5 - fluorouracil was intravenously inject - ed into 8 - week - old C57BL / 6 mice . Three days later , bone marrow cells were collected from the femurs and tibiae and cultured on a 35 - mm RetroNectin Dish ( Takara Bio Inc . , Shiga , Japan ) with 3 ml of DMEM containing 20 % FBS , 100 ng / ml stem cell fac - tor , 100 ng / ml thrombopoietin , and 100 ng / ml Flt3 - L ( Genzyme Techne , Minneapolis , Minnesota , USA ; Cosmo Bio Co . , Tokyo , Japan ) for 24 hours as pres - timulation ( 25 ) . The medium was then replaced by retrovirus - containing supernatant with addition of the same FBS and cytokine concentrations as those used in the prestimulation medium and was changed every day for 3 days . Then the cells on the 35 - mm RetroNectin dish were harvested with cell dissocia - tion buffer ( GIBCO BRL ; Invitrogen Corp . , Carlsbad , California , USA ) and injected into 8 - week - old syn - geneic recipients preconditioned with a single 9 . 0 - Gy irradiation dose .

Results Isolation of LRRC8 and its mutant form . Translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 9 and 20 was determined by spectral karyotyping ( SKY ) FISH analysis ( Figure 1a ) . To identify the translocation site of the derivative of chromosome 20 ( der20 ) , we pre - pared BAC and PAC clones located on the long arm of chromosome 20 . FISH analysis showed that the PAC clone dJ890O15 stepped over the translocation site ( Figure 1b ) . According to Southern blot hybridization analysis with the ET1033 probe derived from dJ890O15 , the translocation site was estimated to exist between the 37 , 345th and 38 , 000th bp of dJ890O15 ( Figure 1c ) . We then analyzed the patient’s DNA by inverse PCR and obtained PCR products containing the translocation site on der20 ( Figure 1d ) . A cDNA fragment containing the translocation site on der9 was also obtained by PCR . Sequencing analysis of these products showed that the translo - cation site existed between the 122 , 214th and 122 , 215th bp of the BAC clone RP11 - 98H23 on chro - mosome 9 , and between the 37 , 632nd and 37 , 633rd bp of the dJ890O15 on chromosome 20 . A single nucleotide insertion ( T ) was observed at the translo - cation site on der20 ( Figure 1e ) . Although no genes located at the translocation site on chromosome 9 were found , exons or coding sequences for two full - length mRNAs , termed FLJ10337 and FLJ20996 , and several spliced mRNAs were split and located over the translocation site , and computer analy - sis using both GENESCAN and HMMGENE predicted the existence of a hypothetical protein . There were no sequences for mRNA around the translocation site ( ∼ 20 kbp ) on chromosome 20 . Sequences for the wild and mutant genes were obtained with 3 ′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends from peripheral white blood cells of the patient . Their schemata are shown in Figure 2a . Tran - scription from the mutant gene as well as the wild - type gene in the patient’s cells was confirmed by RT - PCR ( Figure 2b ) . Wild and mutant forms of the LRRC8 pro - tein were also detected in the patient’s cells by Western blot analysis ( Figure 2c ) . Characteristics of LRRC8 . The length of the coding region of this gene was predicted to be 2 , 433 bp , and the protein consisted of 810 amino acids ( ∼ 94 . 2 kDa ) . The result of Western blot analysis with poAb’s against this protein was compatible with the predicted molec - ular weight ( Figure 2d ) . It had two exons ; exons 1 and 2 encoded 719 and 91 amino acids , respectively . The protein was produced at a higher level in bone marrow cells than in peripheral blood cells ( Figure 2e ) .

Underlined characters represent translated polypeptides from the intron . The Journal of Clinical Investigation | December 2003 | Volume 112 | Number 11 1711 Similarly , murine bone marrow cells contained greater amounts of the protein than peripheral blood cells . The gene was highly conserved between humans and mice : 93 % of nucleotide sequences and 99 % of amino acid sequences were identical ( Figure 3a ) . The struc - ture of the protein predicted by TMHMM and Pfam computer - assisted analysis is shown in Figure 3b . It consisted of four transmembrane helixes located close to the N - terminal and nine leucine - rich repeats ( LRRs ) ( 26 ) close to the C - terminal . Both terminal ends were outside the cell , and the second to ninth LRRs were located consecutively . This gene was named LRRC8 by the nomenclature committee , the Human Genome Organisation . The truncated gene encoded 754 amino acids , including 719 derived from exon 1 and 35 from the intron ( Figure 3c ) . Both wild and mutant LRRC8 proteins were expressed on the patient’s cells . There was no muta - tion in the coding sequences on the unaffected allele . Significance of the mutant LRRC8 . A mouse stem cell virus ( MSCV ) vector ( 27 ) including a fragment encod - ing yellow fluorescent protein ( YFP ) as a selection marker ( MSCV - IRES - YFP ) , designated MIY ( 28 ) , was prepared and used as a control vector ( Figure 4a ) . Then , MutY was constructed with the mutant cDNA and MIY , which successfully yielded the mutant protein ( Figure 4b ) as well as YFP . To evaluate B cell reconsti - tution , lethally irradiated mice were transplanted with MIY - or MutY - infected bone marrow cells . The periph - eral blood cells were analyzed by flow cytometry 3 months after transplantation , and the ratio of YFP - positive cells in each cell lineage was calculated . Although the efficiency of gene transfer into hematopoietic stem cells differed in each mouse , the ratio of YFP - positive cells in the B cell population was significantly decreased , and furthermore , that in the T cell population was decreased compared with those in granulocytes and monocytes of mice transplanted with MutY - infected bone marrow cells ( Figure 4c ) . Statisti - cal analysis is shown in Figure 4d . While our results show that expression of the truncated protein causes abnormalities in B and T cell development , they are consistent with the idea — but do not prove — that the mechanism by which this happens is dominant sup - pression by truncated proteins . To examine the influence of the mutant protein on B cell development , B - lineage cell subsets in the bone mar - row of the transplanted mice were analyzed with flow cytometry ( Figure 5a ) . The development of B cells was arrested at the stage of pro - B ( B220 + , CD43 + ) , and a severe reduction in the proportion of pre - B cells ( B220 + , CD43 – ) was observed . We examined protein expression on B - lineage cells belonging to different maturation stages ( Figure 5b ) . Pro - B cells expressed the protein at a higher level than pre - B cells in the bone marrow , while the expression was much lower on peripheral B cells . Discussion We isolated a novel gene , LRRC8 , from the transloca - tion site on chromosome 9 of a patient with agam - maglobulinemia , and this gene was truncated by the Figure 4 Enforced expression of mutant LRRC8 .

The patient ' s white blood cells expressed both wild - type and truncated LRRC8 pro - teins . LRRC8 is highly conserved between humans and mice : 93 % and 99 % of nucleotide and amino acid sequences were identical , respectively . Transplanta - tion of bone marrow cells that were forced to express truncated LRRC8 to lethally irradiated mice induced a severe reduction of the B cell number in peripheral blood . Our results indicate that the LRRC8 deficit is responsible for the B cell deficiency in this patient and that normal LRRC8 is required for B cell development . We showed that development of B - lineage cells expressing the truncated form of LRRC8 is arrested at the stage of pro - B , and the proportion of pre - B cells was severely reduced in the bone marrow . Since the highest expression of LRRC8 protein was seen on pro - B cells among subsets of B - lineage cells , this pro - tein seems to be a key molecule for growth and / or differentiation in pro - B and pre - B cells . The LRRs are functional domains that mediate adhe - sion to other molecules ( 26 ) . The LRRs of LRRC8 are located on the outside of cells . Various molecules with such a structure are known to act as cell surface recep - tors , including RP105 ( LPS receptor ) , CD42 ( vWF receptor ) , TrkA ( high - affinity nerve growth factor receptor ) , and follicle - stimulating hormone receptor ( 26 , 29 ) . It is possible that LRRC8 has a novel specific ligand that induces B cell development . LRRC8 lacks domains that can transduce signals to the cytosol or nucleus . RP105 , a Toll - like receptor on B cells , has an adapter protein named MD - 1 instead of a signal - trans - ducing domain ( 30 ) . Similarly , LRRC8 might also have adapter molecules for signal transduction . The intact LRRC8 gene on the unaffected allele of the patient was transcribed , and intact LRRC8 protein was expressed . Nevertheless , B cells were totally absent in the peripheral blood . This suggests that the truncated form has not a quantitative effect but a dominant - sup - pressor effect on B cell development . Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome is ascribed to a domi - nant - negative mutant of Fas ( 31 ) . Fas is a homotrimer of Fas subunits . When one of the three subunits is replaced with a mutant , the Fas complex loses its func - tion . Therefore , only one - eighth of the receptors can transduce death signal into cells in patients with the heterozygous mutation . Dominant - negative mutants are known in several receptors that compose homo - oligomers : dynamin - 1 , growth hormone receptor , and insulin receptor ( 32 – 34 ) . Although there are no known proteins containing LRR structures that form homo - oligomers , LRRC8 might form such a complex . In addition to the deficiency of B cells , a decrease in the proportion of T cells among cells transfected with the mutant LRRC8 was also observed . Although both human and murine T cells express LRRC8 ( data not shown ) , the number of T cells was not decreased in our patient . The difference between the function of LRRC8 in mice and its function in humans should be clarified in a further study . Minor facial anomalies as well as agammaglobu - linemia were observed in the patient . Using RT - PCR , we have determined that LRRC8 is expressed in brain , heart , lung , liver , and kidney ( unpublished observa - tions ) . Since this gene is expressed in a ubiquitous fashion beyond lymphoid and hematopoietic systems , the protein might therefore play a role in morpho - genesis . A further analysis of LRRC8 may contribute to our understanding of its roles in development . There are no known proteins homologous to LRRC8 , but there are at least two hypothetical pro - teins , AD158 and T cell activation leucine repeat – rich protein ( TA - LRRP ) . There are also two predictable proteins , LRRC5 and FLJ23420 , which may be frag - ments of other LRRC8 homologs . LRRC8 , AD158 , and TA - LRRP conserve 59 % of their amino acid sequences and share a unique structure : four trans - membrane helixes and eight sequentially located LRRs . TA - LRRP was found by a microarray assay of induced genes in activated T cells . These putative proteins , sharing a unique structure , constitute a novel protein family that has not , to our knowledge , been reported so far ( unpublished observations ) . Although their functions remain to be elucidated , it seems plausible that they play essential and funda - mental roles in morphogenesis . Acknowledgments We thank N . Sakai and H .
