Jensen 1 , * , Andrew G . Woodman 1 , M . Eric Hyndman 2 & Hans J . Vogel 1 L - plastin is a calcium - regulated actin - bundling protein that is expressed in cells of hematopoietic origin and in most metastatic cancer cells . These cell types are mobile and require the constant remodeling of their actin cytoskeleton , where L - plastin bundles filamentous actin . The calcium - dependent regulation of the actin - bundling activity of L - plastin is not well understood . We have used NMR spectroscopy to determine the solution structure of the EF - hand calcium - sensor headpiece domain . Unexpectedly , this domain does not bind directly to the four CH - domains of L - plastin . A novel switch helix is present immediately after the calcium - binding region and it binds tightly to the EF - hand motifs in the presence of calcium . We demonstrate that this switch helix plays a major role during actin - bundling . Moreover a peptide that competitively inhibits the association between the EF - hand motifs and the switch helix was shown to deregulate the actin - bundling activity of L - plastin . Overall , these findings may help to develop new drugs that target the L - plastin headpiece and interfere in the metastatic activity of cancer cells . L - plastin ( LPL ) is a 70 kDa Ca 2 + - and actin - binding protein that plays an important role in both the adaptive and innate immune system 1 – 4 . Among the three isoforms found in humans ( L - , T - , and I - plastin ) , LPL is exclusively expressed in cells of hematopoietic origin , where it can act as an actin cross - linker by promoting actin bundling 5 – 8 . The actin - bundling activity of LPL is known to be calcium - dependent , where increasing calcium concentrations inhibit the formation of actin - bundles 9 , 10 . It has been demonstrated that LPL has an optimal Ca 2 + - binding affinity to respond to intracellular Ca 2 + - signals , whereas T - plastin from solid tissues , such as fibroblasts and epithelial cells , is relatively insensitive 11 . The sensitive response of LPL to Ca 2 + - signals is probably crucial for the frequent morphology changes of leukocytes where constant remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton is required to give rise to cell motility . Indeed , LPL is known to be required for T cell activation and motility 2 , 12 . Furthermore , the absence of LPL from neutrophils causes them to be defective and they are no longer able to kill pathogens 13 . Interestingly , LPL is also expressed after the transformation of a normal cell to a metastatic cancerous cell 14 – 19 . The protein has also been recognized as a biomarker for the early detection of various forms of cancer , such as kidney 20 , colon 21 , and breast cancer 22 . A calcium signal is induced when cancer cells bind to proteins of the basal lamina 23 . This calcium - mediated signal suggests that LPL plays a crucial role in invasion and cellular adhesion of cancer cells . Indeed , the inhibition of LPL through the intracellular expression of an alpaca antibody blocks filopodia formation and reduces the invasion of prostate carcinoma cells 24 . More recently , studies of the formation of invadopodia and filopodia in cancer cells showed that the two actin - bundling proteins L - plastin and fascin played distinct and complementary roles . However , both proteins were required to create the actin - based cellular protrusions that give rise to the migration , invasion , and the metastatic properties of cancer cells 25 . Furthermore , results obtained with a mouse model have shown that metastasis of prostate cancer is diminished when LPL expression is reduced , while increased LPL expression levels and its phosphorylation give rise to increased metas - tasis 26 . Therapeutic tools used to decrease the rate of cancer progression have been developed based on recombi - nant adenoviral vectors that are driven by the LPL promoter 27 – 29 . LPL is comprised of two N - terminal EF - hand motifs ( head - piece domain ) , which are homologous to a single domain of calmodulin ( CaM ) ( 34 . 7 % identical ) , followed by two actin - binding domains ( ABDs ) 5 .

While many signaling and cytoskel - etal proteins share these CH domains 30 , plastins are the only known proteins to have two tandem ABDs 31 – 33 . The four CH domains are each folded into a compact globular shape where the ABD1 and ABD2 are arranged back - to - back 34 , 35 . Each ABD can bind an actin - filament , thereby LPL can cross - link between two actin - filaments to form a tight bundle . Although , it has been shown that ABD1 binds actin ten times stronger than ABD2 in vitro 36 , it is still not clear which ABD binds the actin - filament first 36 , 37 . LPL is regulated not only by the intra - cellular Ca 2 + - concentration , but also by post - translational modifica - tions , such as the phosphorylation of Ser5 22 , 38 – 40 . Among the three human isoforms , LPL is the only isoform which has been shown to be phosphorylated in vivo . Although the protein may have several other putative post - translational modification sites , to date only phosphorylation of Ser5 ( and Ser7 only in hematopoietic cells ) has been described in the literature 2 . Phosphorylation at Ser5 of L - plastin allows it to function in a coordinated fashion to permit adhesion , migration , and remodeling of actin to occur 41 . The phosphorylation of L - plastin Ser5 in polymorphonuclear leukocytes is essential for continued adhesion . Jones et al . showed that adhesion to serum - coated surfaces was induced by the Ser5 - phosphorylated N - terminal peptide of LPS . L - plastin’s targeting to the actin cytoskeleton is mediated by Ser5 phosphorylation 42 . When Ser5 , the major phosphorylation site is mutated to Ala , the protein is inactive 41 . However , when Ser5 was substituted with Glu in vivo , the mutant pro - tein has the same effect as the native protein 41 . Ser5 phosphorylation is also important for the control of actin turn - over in focal adhesions 43 . On the other hand , the physiological function of Ser7 phosphorylation has not yet been elucidated . Very recently it has been shown that S - glutathionylation may also contribute to the regulation of LPL function 44 . In addition , LPL activity may also be modulated via direct binding to other proteins such as vimentin 45 , the protein - ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 ( Iba1 ) 46 , grancalcin 47 , or CaM 48 . Although it has been well established that LPL bundles actin in a calcium - dependent manner , the mechanism of the Ca 2 + - switch is currently unknown . A detailed understanding of the Ca 2 + - switch of LPL at the molecular level could potentially lead to the development of drugs that can deregulate the actin - bundling functions of LPL in cancer cells and prevent them from becoming metastatic . In this study , we have determined the solution NMR structures of the N - terminal headpiece domain , which constitutes the Ca 2 + sensor EF - hand motif of LPL . The structure was determined in the presence and absence of Ca 2 + . Our original hypothesis was that the headpiece domain would bind directly to one of the four folded CH - domains of LPL , in a manner similar to calmodulin ( CaM ) binding to CH domains of various proteins 49 – 52 . However , this was not the case . Instead , we have discov - ered that an additional regulatory motif is present in LPL which we have called the ‘switch - helix’ . This region is located immediately following the two EF - hand motifs and well before the start of ABD1 . It forms an α - helix only in the presence of Ca 2 + , which binds to the EF - hand motifs . Upon removal of Ca 2 + , the switch helix is released and this part of the protein is now unstructured . In subsequent experiments , this region was shown to be impor - tant for modulating the actin bundling activity of LPL and that it could act as the Ca 2 + - dependent switch of LPL . In in vitro experiments , we have also demonstrated that it is possible to deregulate the Ca 2 + - switch of LPL using a peptide that competes with Helix - 5 for binding to the EF - hand domain of the protein . Results Structural characterization of calcium - free EF and calcium - bound EF - H5 . All backbone amide resonances except for the Pro residues of the Ca 2 + - free EF and the Ca 2 + - bound EF - H5 constructs were unam - biguously assigned in the 1 H , 15 N - HSQC NMR spectra ( Supplementary Fig . S1 ) . The backbone amide resonances of Ca 2 + - free EF - H5 were also completed except for Arg 91 and Tyr 48 , which could not be identified due to extensive signal overlap in the middle of the spectrum . This overlap is characteristic of the presence of some unstructured elements that are present in part of the apo - protein ( see below ) . Next , the chemical shift index ( CSI ) for the C α and C’ atoms were analyzed to predict the secondary structures in both the Ca 2 + - bound and Ca 2 + - free forms of EF - H5 ( Supplementary Fig . S2 ) . As expected , EF - H5 contained four α - helices that make up two helix - loop - helix EF - hand Ca 2 + - binding motifs . Interestingly , the Ca 2 + - bound EF - H5 protein was found to contain an extra α - helix ( H5 ) at the C - terminal end , which was not formed in the Ca 2 + - free form . Taken together with the hetero - nuclear { 1 H } - 15 N NOE data ( Supplementary Fig . S2 ) , this region of the protein is unfolded and flexible in the absence of Ca 2 + , while it becomes a stable α - helix upon Ca 2 + - binding . Subsequently , we generated an EF construct in which the H5 region is omitted ( Fig . 1 ; EF construct ) . We compared the HSQC spectra of the EF and EF - H5 to look for any changes in the structure upon removal of H5 ( Supplementary Fig . S3a ) . As expected , in the Ca 2 + - free form , there are no significant chemical shift changes in the HSQC NMR spectra except for the C - terminal region , indicating that the structure of the apo EF domain is not affected by omitting the H5 . Hence , the H5 region is not important for the overall folding of the EF region in the Ca 2 + - free form . By removing this unstructured element from the protein , we could eliminate most of the signal overlap at the center of HSQC spec - trum and we could achieve unambiguous assignments that facilitated the determination of the tertiary structure of the Ca 2 + - free form . In contrast , significant spectral changes were observed for the Ca 2 + - bound form of the EF - construct and many signals became somewhat broader ( Supplementary Fig . S3b ) , indicating that H5 is an integral part of the Ca 2 + - bound protein and is a requirement to stabilize its structure . The tertiary structures of Ca 2 + - EF - H5 and Ca 2 + - free EF were successfully determined using proton - proton distance information derived from NOESY experiments using the automated NOE assignment protocol implemented in the CYANA software . All the parameters from the structure calculations are summarized in Supplementary Table S1 . Figure 2a represents 30 NMR solution structures of Ca 2 + - free EF superimposed with a root mean squared deviation ( r . m . s . d . ) of 0 . 40 Å . The first EF - hand motif consists of helix 1 ( residues 8 – 21 ) and helix 2 ( residues 31 – 39 ) . The second EF - hand motif consists of helix 3 ( residues 48 – 60 ) and helix 4 ( resi - dues 71 – 79 ) . The two calcium - binding loops of the EF - hand motifs are connected through a small anti - parallel β - sheet , as is typically found in such proteins 53 , 54 . The bundle of four helices is in a closed conformation where www . nature . com / scientificreports / 3 Scientific RepoRts | 7 : 40662 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / srep40662 Figure 1 .

In Fig . 2b , the superimposed 30 structures of Ca 2 + - bound EF - H5 are displayed with a rmsd of 0 . 37 Å . Similar to the Ca 2 + - free form , the EF - hand motifs are composed of helix 1 ( residues 8 – 21 ) , helix 2 ( residues 31 – 40 ) , helix 3 ( residues 47 – 57 ) , and helix 4 ( residues 71 – 79 ) , except that the bundle is now in an open - conformation . Ca 2 + - binding induces dramatic changes in the angles between the four helices , resulting in the exposure of a hydrophobic pocket ( Supplementary Fig . S4 ) . Interestingly , an extra helix ( H5 ; residues 85 – 94 ) is tightly associated with this exposed pocket , which is very similar to a typical CaM - target peptide interaction 55 . Bulky hydrophobic residues of H5 including V86 , F90 , and I94 are key residues that associate with the hydropho - bic pocket and act as anchoring residues ( Fig . 2b ) . The EF - hand domain and H5 are directly connected by a short flexible linker ( Fig . 2b and Supplementary Figs S2 ) . As the H5 region is free from the EF domain in the absence of Ca 2 + , we wondered if this region becomes a part of the ABDs . We have compared the 1 H , 15 N HSQC NMR spectra of 15 N - labeled ABD1 ( residues 113 – 379 ) and H5 - ABD1 ( residues 83 – 379 ) ( Supplementary Fig . S5a ) . There are no substantial chemical shift differences except for extra signals in the H5 - ABD1 spectrum all of which are located in a random coil region of spectrum ( ~ 8 ppm ) . Next , we investigated the possible interaction between H5 and ABD2 . We titrated the synthetic H5 peptide into the sample containing 15 N - labeled ABD2 ( residues 384 – 627 ) ( Supplementary Fig . S5b ) . Again , no chemical shift changes were observed , indicating no interaction . Therefore , we have concluded that in the absence of any actin filaments , the H5 region is free from either the EF - domain or the ABDs in the absence of Ca 2 + . Effect of Ser5 phosphorylation on the EF structure . In order to study the structural effects caused by the Ser5 phosphorylation , we have prepared a S5E mutant of the EF - H5 construct . The S5E mutation has been utilized previously to mimic the phosphorylation at Ser 5 41 . Our results showed that when Ser5 was mutated to Glu , both the Ca 2 + - free and Ca 2 + - bound form experienced only a slight change in conformation , which can be seen from the NMR spectra ( Supplementary Fig . S6 ) . The few residues that experience chemical shift changes were all located in the immediate vicinity of the mutation . Therefore , phosphorylation does not seem to affect the interaction between the EF domain and H5 and the global structure of the EF domain remains unchanged . This result is resonable as this phosphorylation site is located in the flexible N - terminal portion of EF - H5 in both forms ( Supplementary Fig . S2 ) . Isothermal titration calorimetry ( ITC ) experiments . To investigate the role of H5 in Ca 2 + - binding to the Ca 2 + - sensor domain of LPL , we performed ITC experiments for the EF and EF - H5 constructs . Figure 3a shows the ITC isotherm obtained during a calcium - titration experiment and the fitting to determine the ther - modynamic parameters for EF - H5 . The isotherm shows that it contains two binding events which are very close in their Kds . However , we were not able to unambiguously derive two sets of ITC parameters from these data . The first Ca 2 + binding seems to produce slightly larger heat , which may possibly be attributed to the folding Figure 3 . Calorimetric titration of ( a ) EF - H5 and ( b ) EF with Ca 2 + . The baseline corrected ITC titrations are shown in the top panel . Derived binding isotherms were fitted to obtain thermodynamic parameters ( bottom panel ) . www . nature . com / scientificreports / 5 Scientific RepoRts | 7 : 40662 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / srep40662 of H5 . When we analyzed these data as a single binding event , a Kd value of 0 . 7 ± 0 . 2 µ M ( range indicates SD , n = 3 ) with a stoichiometry of approximately 2 was obtained and this is consistent with a previous report 11 . On the other hand , the EF construct in which the H5 region is omitted showed two clearly distinctive sequential Ca 2 + - binding events ( Fig . 3b ) . In this case , the curve fitting with a two sites model produced two very different Kd values , 0 . 3 ± 0 . 1and 2 . 6 ± 0 . 2 µ M ( ranges indicate SD , n = 3 ) that could easily be fitted . These results suggest that H5 is required for promoting high affinity Ca 2 + - binding to one of the two Ca 2 + - binding sites . These data are summarized in Table 1 . Actin - bundling assay with various LPS constructs . In order to investigate the role of H5 in actin - bundling , we incubated platelet actin and various LPL constructs ( depicted in Fig . 1 ) to form actin - bundles and we analyzed the amount of actin in the pellet after low - speed centrifugation ( Fig . 4 ) . The full - length LPL shows Ca 2 + - dependent actin - bundling where ~ 90 % of the actin was found in the pellet in the presence of EGTA , whereas the amount was reduced to ~ 50 % in the presence of Ca 2 + ( Fig . 4a ) . Consistently , ~ 70 % of LPL was found Constructs N1 K d 1 ( µ M ) H1 ( cal / mol ) S1 ( cal / mol / K ) N2 K d 2 ( µ M ) H2 ( cal / mol ) S2 ( cal / mol / K ) EF - H5 1 2 . 3 0 . 7 ± 0 . 2 2 − 4507 ± 56 13 . 0 ± 0 . 2 — — — — EF 1 . 0 0 . 3 ± 0 . 1 − 1341 ± 82 24 . 3 ± 2 . 0 1 . 2 2 . 6 ± 0 . 2 − 4179 ± 236 10 . 8 ± 1 . 9 Table 1 .

After low speed centrifugation , the amount of actin in the pellet was estimated via SDS - PAGE and Coomassie brilliant blue staining . Each experiment was repeated three times ( n = 3 ) to obtain average values and standard deviations ( SD ) . www . nature . com / scientificreports / 6 Scientific RepoRts | 7 : 40662 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / srep40662 in the pellet with EGTA , while this amount was reduced to ~ 50 % with Ca 2 + ( Fig . 4a ) . This result is in line with previous reports 9 . It was unexpected that the ABD12 construct , which only contains four CH - domains , produced only a very small amount of actin bundles ( Fig . 4b ) . However , the inclusion of H5 in the construct ( H5 - ABD12 ) dramatically increased the amount of actin bundles to almost the same level with the full - length LPL , suggesting that H5 is indispensable for actin - bundling of LPL . Consistently , with the LPL constructs in which the H5 region was deleted ( LPL - Δ H5 ) , the amount of actin bundles was drastically reduced particularly in the presence of EGTA ( Fig . 4c ) . Next , we have tested the LPL - Ins construct where an extra 16 amino - acid residues were inserted to separate H5 from the ABDs ( Fig . 1 ) . Similar to LPL - Δ H5 , less effective actin - bundling was observed in the presence of EGTA ( Fig . 4d ) . Surface plasmon resonance ( SPR ) experiment . SPR experiments were carried out to investigate the interactions between the EF domain of LPL ( EF construct ) and various synthetic CaM - binding peptides . Since the EF structure of LPL is very similar to one of the two CaM domains , we decided to study two typical CaM - binding peptides , CaMKIp and smMLCKp , as well as the cytotoxic peptide melittin , which is also known to bind to CaM 56 , 57 ( Supplementary Fig . S7 ) . Although , all peptides tested were able to interact with the EF domain of LPL in the presence of Ca 2 + , the quality of the SPR data obtained for the smMLCKp was not sufficient for the analysis ( data not shown ) . The Kd values derived were compared to that of an H5 synthetic peptide representing the H5 region of LPL ( residues 83 – 100 ) . The Kd’s obtained are listed in Table 2 . The affinity between EF and the H5 peptide was found to be relatively weak with a Kd value of 3 . 5 × 10 − 6 M . This is consistent with the intermedi - ate exchange and resultant line broadening observed in the HSQC NMR spectrum when the H5 peptide is added into 15 N - labeled EF ( Supplementary Fig . S8 ) . The strong CaM binding peptides ( Kd = < 10 − 8 M ) , CaMKIp and smMLCKp , could also bind to the EF domain of LPL , albeit weakly . Interestingly , the melittin peptide bound one order of magnitude stronger than the H5 peptide . Interactions between LPL and melittin , and its effect on actin - bundling . Since we have found that melittin can bind stronger to EF than the synthetic H5 peptide , we were interested to determine if this peptide can displace H5 from the Ca 2 + - bound LPL . We titrated the melittin peptide into a sample containing the 15 N - labeled EF - H5 and the chemical shift changes were monitored by HSQC NMR spectra ( Fig . 5 ) . Many signals disappeared as we added the peptide , indicating an interaction with an intermediate exchange behavior on the NMR time scale . As we expected , most of the signals that disappeared originated from the residues in the bound H5 region ( Fig . 5 ) , suggesting that H5 is displaced by the melittin peptide . As a control , a titration experiment was also performed with the CaMKIp peptide , which has almost the same Kd as the H5 peptide ( Table 2 ) . There were no substantial chemical shift changes detected in this titration , indicating that the CaMKIp peptide was unable to displace H5 . Finally , we have examined whether the presence of melittin peptide affects the actin - bundling of LPL Peptide K D ( M ) H5p ( 3 . 52 ± 0 . 24 ) × 10 − 6 CaMKIp ( 3 . 27 ± 0 . 15 ) × 10 − 6 Melittin ( 1 . 58 ± 0 . 20 ) × 10 − 7 Table 2 .

The assignments for the affected signals are indicated . www . nature . com / scientificreports / 7 Scientific RepoRts | 7 : 40662 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / srep40662 ( Fig . 4e ) . The Ca 2 + - dependent regulation of actin - bundling of LPL was clearly less pronounced in the presence of melittin . The actin - bundling induced by the melittin peptide alone was negligible ( data not shown ) . Discussion By determining the NMR solution structures of the EF - hand domains of LPL , we have discovered that an extra ‘switch - helix’ can be formed between the EF construct and the ABDs which may act as the Ca 2 + - sensor . This fifth helix of LPL ( H5 ) is only formed in the presence of Ca 2 + when it is bound to the two EF - hand motifs . On the other hand , the H5 region is released from the EF domain and becomes unstructured in the absence of Ca 2 + . This is consistent with the previous CD spectroscopy results that show a large increase in the helical content in EF - H5 upon binding Ca 2 + ions 11 . H5 is tightly associated with the exposed hydrophobic pocket of Ca 2 + - bound EF domain , which is reminiscent of CaM - target peptide binding 55 . Interestingly , in contrast to the methionine rich hydrophobic pockets of CaM , all four methionine residues of EF - H5 are located on the outside surface of the LPL EF domain ( Supplementary Fig . S4 ) . The flexible side chains of methionine allow the target binding pockets of CaM to accommodate widely different targets 55 . This implies that the hydrophobic pocket of the LPL EF - hands is devoid of methionine side - chains and seems to be designed to be rather specific for the H5 sequence . Importantly , amino - acid sequence alignments show that the H5 region is highly conserved among all three human plastin isoforms ( data not shown ) . Furthermore , from our sequence analysis , the plastin isoform from the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum ( FimA ) also appears to have a potential H5 helical region and it has been shown that this protein can also bundle actin filaments in a Ca 2 + - dependent manner 58 . LPL represents an example of an automodulation mechanism that is seen in some EF - hand proteins such as plant Ca 2 + - dependent protein kinases ( CDPKs ) and the ER Ca 2 + - sensor stromal interaction molecule 1 ( STIM1 ) , where the calcium sensor domain and regulatory target domain are integrated in the same protein 54 . The H5 region of LPL was previously predicted as a potential binding site for CaM 48 . Indeed this sequence produced a high theoretically predicted score for CaM binding 59 . Wabnitz and coworkers have demonstrated that CaM and LPL co - localize in the T - cell / APC contact zone and that the deletion of the H5 region decreases the localization level of LPL by ~ 50 % . In their work , the direct binding between CaM and LPL was confirmed by a CaM - pull down assay , and it was only seen in the absence of Ca 2 + . Therefore , we have tested the inter - action between EF - H5 and CaM in the presence of EDTA . However , we were unable to detect any substan - tial chemical shift changes in the HSQC spectrum of 15 N - labeled apo - CaM when we added non - labeled EF - H5 ( Supplementary Fig . S9 ) . These data suggests that the interface for CaM should be located outside of the EF - H5 region ( possibly in the CH - domains ) . Indeed , CaM binding to CH - domains from many different actin - binding proteins has been reported before 49 – 52 . The decreased localization level of LPL in the contact zone by removing the H5 region may then be attributed to the reduced actin - bundling activity of LPL ( see below ) . In order to further investigate the role of H5 in the Ca 2 + - dependent actin - bundling of LPL , we have performed actin - bundling assays with a series of different LPL constructs ( Fig . 4 ) . The deletion of H5 from LPL ( LPL Δ H5 ) significantly reduced the bundling activity of LPL in the presence of EGTA compared to the wild - type , suggest - ing that H5 plays an important role in this activity ( Fig . 4a , c ) . However , the activity also dropped slightly in the presence of Ca 2 + compared to the full - length LPL , suggesting that possible steric hindrance could be caused by the reduced distance between the EF domain and the ABDs . Therefore , in this work , we also generated the LPL - Ins construct ( Fig . 1 ) . By replacing the H5 in LPL with a ( GGGS ) 4 linker , the actin - bundling activity also dropped substantially in the absence of Ca 2 + , albeit to a lesser extent than that seen with the LPL Δ H5 ( Fig . 4d ) . This observation confirmed that the steric hindrance caused by the reduced distance is not the major reason for the reduced actin bundling . We noted that our results indicated that the bundling activity of the isolated ABDs ( ABD12 ) was very poor ( Fig . 4b ) , however , the slightly longer construct that also contained H5 ( H5 - ABD12 ) dramatically increased the amount of bundled actin . From these results , it seems reasonable to conclude that H5 is required for sustaining the effective actin - bundling activities of LPL and that the Ca 2 + - bound EF domain sequesters H5 , which therefore acts as a Ca 2 + - switch . Previous cryo - EM studies of LPL constructs , when they are decorated on the F - actin filament , have provided significant low resolution structural information 37 , 60 – 63 . Although isolated ABD1 , which consists of CH1 and CH2 , binds an order of magnitude stronger than ABD2 , containing CH3 and CH4 36 , cryo - EM studies have shown that ABD1 binds to actin filaments in a polymorphic and sparse manner 37 . Indeed , the crystal structure of the actin - binding core ( ABDs ) of Arabidopsis thaliana fim - brin ( AtFim1 ) and Schizosaccharomyces pombe fimbrin ( sac6 ) have revealed that the relative domain orientation between the CH1 and CH2 cannot be defined with a single orientation , which suggests some flexibility between the domains 34 . Indeed , the relative domain orientation in the crystal structure was not consistent with that deter - mined by the cyro - EM studies 60 , 61 , 63 and was not supported by previous mutational studies 64 . These observations suggest that a significant rearrangement of relative domain orientation of the four CH domains is required prior to actin - binding . Based on the earlier cryo - EM results and our own observations , we propose a possible model for how the actin - bundling of LPL is regulated by Ca 2 + ( Fig . 6 ) . When the intra - cellular Ca 2 + - concentration is low , the H5 region is free from the EF domain . According to our results , H5 does not interact directly with the ABDs in the absence of any the actin filaments ( Supplementary Fig . S5 ) . However , from the cryo - EM structure 60 , the H5 region may interact with ABD1 ( between CH1 and CH2 ) upon binding to the actin - filament where H5 acts as a wedge to stabilize domain orientation to form a favorable actin - binding interface . When the Ca 2 + - concentration is elevated , the Ca 2 + - bound EF - domain sequesters H5 from the ABD1 and the removal of the wedge would lead to an unstable domain orientation and therefore lower the actin - bundling efficiency . The possible sterical hin - drance caused by the reduced distance between EF and ABDs may play a role in the regulation as discussed above . It has been shown that ABDs become more resistant to tryptic digestion in the presence of Ca 2 + , suggesting that the ABDs are protected by the spatially close EF domain 60 . In this study , we have also found that H5 is not only the Ca 2 + - switch of actin - bundling , but also an important modulator for the Ca 2 + - binding to the EF domain . The association of H5 with the EF - hand motifs is required to enhance the Ca 2 + - affinity of one of Ca 2 + - binding sites to www . nature . com / scientificreports / 8 Scientific RepoRts | 7 : 40662 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / srep40662 µ M range . Very recently , a similar role for a helix that is positioned in the vicinity of the EF - hand motifs has been reported for one of the NCS family calcium binding proteins , the guanylyl cyclase activator protein 1 ( GCAP1 ) , in which an adjacent helix is also important for high affinity Ca 2 + - binding 65 . Since we have established a model for the Ca 2 + - switch , it was of great interest to us to determine whether peptides / drugs can out - compete H5 and consequently disable the Ca 2 + - switch of LPL ( Fig . 6c ) . This may lead to the development of potential drugs that could contribute to suppressing the metastatic activity of cancer cells . We have performed SPR experiments with various CaM - binding peptide candidates ( Supplementary Fig . S7 ) . The synthetic peptide corresponding to the H5 region binds to the Ca 2 + - bound EF with the Kd of 10 − 6 M . Considering that H5 is directly linked to the EF domain in the actual protein , it would require much higher affinity to outcompete . Indeed , the HSQC spectrum of 15 N - labeled EF saturated with the H5 peptide did not produce the same spectrum as EF - H5 , suggesting a much lower affinity than when they are directly connected ( Supplementary Fig . S8 ) . Among the peptides we have examined , only melittin showed a much higher affinity than the H5 peptide ( Table 2 ) . We have confirmed that melittin can out - compete H5 in the EF - H5 construct ( Fig . 5 ) . Melittin also reduced the Ca 2 + - dependency of the actin - bundling of LPL , indicating that this peptide can interfere in the Ca 2 + - switch of LPL as we expected ( Fig . 4e ) . In addition to the Ca 2 + switch , the targeting of LPL to the actin cytoskeleton is also regulated by the phos - phorylation of Ser5 41 . Among all three human plastin isoforms , LPL is the only isoform that is currently known to be phosporylated in vivo 40 . Unlike other actin - binding proteins , where phosphorylation usually occurs in the actin - binding domain , LPL phosphorylation seems to take place on the regulatory Ca 2 + - binding domain . Janji and coworkers demonstrated that compared to the non - phosphorylated LPL protein , the S5E mutant had increased actin bundling activity 41 . They hypothesized that Ser5 phosphorylation would cause a conformational change in the Ca 2 + - binding domain that would affect the interaction of the actin - binding domains with actin . Our results show that the phosphorylation of Ser5 does not induce a conformational change in the EF domain . From the reduced actin - bundling observed with H5 - ABD12 construct compared to the full - length LPL , it is clear that the EF domain also contributes to the actin bundling ( Fig . 4a , b ) , consistent with a previous report 61 . Therefore , we propose that the phosphorylation of Ser5 directly enhances this effect . Development of metastasis provides the most serious challenge for cancer treatment and is responsible for most cancer related deaths . A number of recent studies have shown that ectopically expressed LPL is largely responsible for this process 19 . Therefore , LPL presents itself as a promising target for drug development to prevent the metastatic activity of the cancer cells . It is also well known that inhibition of fascin , another actin - bundling protein , is a viable approach to block tumor metastasis 66 , 67 . In this study , as a proof of concept , we have demon - strated that melittin that can interfere with the association of the EF - domain with H5 can disable the Ca 2 + - switch of LPL . The melittin peptide , which is isolated from bee venom , has been reported to have anticancer activity including the inhibition of metastasis by reducing cell motility and it has been proposed as an agent for anticancer therapy 68 , 69 . However , melittin is also a strong hemolytic peptide that is toxic to all normal cells . Therefore , it is Figure 6 . Possible model for the regulatory Ca 2 + - switch of LPL . ( a ) The regulatory helix ( H5 ) stabilizes the actin binding interface formed with CH1 and 2 ( ABD1 ) in the absence of Ca 2 + . ( b ) The Ca 2 + - bound EF hands sequesters H5 from ABD1 , resulting in a less stable domain orientation , which leads to the lower actin bundling efficiency . ( c ) Peptides or drugs which can block the association between H5 and EF hands can potentially deregulate the Ca 2 + - switch of LPL . www . nature . com / scientificreports / 9 Scientific RepoRts | 7 : 40662 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / srep40662 not a suitable peptide for direct clinical applications . Nevertheless , drugs that can block the binding pocket of the EF domain of LPL and that are safe for clinical application could be discovered via high - throughput screening . Therefore , we believe that our findings may be a significant first step towards the future development of drugs that target the metastatic events that occur in many types of cancer cells . Methods Protein expression and purification . A synthetic gene with optimized codons for the expression of the full - length human L - plastin protein ( LPL ) in E . coli was purchased from GeneArt . From the full - length LPL gene as the template , all the constructs used in this study were generated by a standard PCR protocol ( Fig . 1 ) . To generate the expression vectors for the LPL - EF , LPL - EF - H5 , ABD1 , H5 - ABD1 , and ABD2 constructs , the PCR products were subcloned into a pET15 vector ( Invitrogen ) , which contained an N - terminal His - tag and a TEV protease cleavage site , using NdeI and XhoI sites . To generate the expression vectors for all other constructs , the PCR products were subcloned into a pGEX - 6p - 1 vector ( GE Healthcare ) using XhoI and BamHI sites . The vector was modified so as to contain a TEV protease cleavage site between the GST and construct . To create EF - H5 - S5E , which mimics the phosphorylated state , Ser 5 near the N - terminal end of the EF - H5 construct was mutated to Glu using the Quick Change site - directed mutagenesis kit ( Stratagene ) . All the recombinant plasmids were trans - formed into competent E . coli BL21 ( DE3 ) ( Novagen ) cells for protein expression . E . coli cells were grown in Luria Bertani medium with 100 µ g / ml of ampicillin at 37 °C . Uniformly 15 N - or 15 N , 13 C - labelled proteins were prepared in M9 minimal medium supplemented with 0 . 5 g / L 15 NH 4 Cl and / or 3 g / L 13 C - glucose . At an optical density of ~ 0 . 6 ( 600 nm ) , the cultures were induced with 0 . 5 – 1 . 0 mM IPTG . After 4 hours , the bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation . For the His - tagged constructs , the cell pellet was resuspended in the IMAC binding buffer ( 20 mM Tris - Cl , 0 . 1 M NaCl , and 50 mM imidazole , pH 8 . 0 ) and lysed via French Press . The supernatant was applied onto an IMAC column ( GE Healthcare ) . The column was washed extensively with the IMAC binding buffer and the His - tagged proteins were eluted with the elution buffer ( 20 mM Tris - Cl , 0 . 1 M NaCl , and 300 mM imidazole , pH 8 . 0 ) . The His - tag was then cleaved with TEV protease in the digestion buffer ( 20 mM Tris - Cl , 0 . 1 M NaCl , 0 . 5 mM EDTA , and 1 mM dithiothreitol ) at 34 °C . The mix - ture was then loaded onto the cOmplete column ( GE Healthcare ) to remove the TEV protease and the His - tag from the protein . The GST - fusion proteins were purified using a Glutathione Sepharose 4 Fast Flow column ( GE Healthcare ) . The cell pellet was resuspended in the extraction buffer ( 50 mM Tris - Cl , 100 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , pH 7 . 5 ) and lysed by French Press . The supernatant was applied onto the column equilibrated with the extrac - tion buffer . The column was washed with the extraction buffer supplemented with 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 and then further washed with the elution buffer with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 . The column was equilibrated with the digestion buffer and the GST - fusion protein was digested with a TEV protease on the column at 34 °C . The eluted fractions were passed through the cOmplete column to remove the TEV protease . TEV protease was expressed and puri - fied from the pRK793 plasmid as previously described 70 . Protein purification was verified using SDS - PAGE and Coomassie brilliant blue staining . NMR spectroscopy experiments . The calcium - free samples of EF - H5 , EF - H5 - S5E , and EF contained 0 . 5 – 1 . 0 mM 15 N - or 13 C , 15 N - labeled protein , 100 mM KCl , 20 mM Bis - Tris ( pH 6 . 8 ) , 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 03 % NaN 3 , 10 mM 2 H - labelled dithiothreitol ( 2 H - DTT ) , and 0 . 5 mM 2 , 2 - dimethyl - 2 - silapentane - 5 - sulfonate ( DSS ) in 99 . 99 % D 2 O or 10 % D 2 O / 90 % H 2 O . The calcium free non - labeled LPL - EF was also prepared in 99 . 99 % D 2 O with the same buffer components . The calcium - bound form of those constructs were prepared in buffer containing ~ 1 mM 15 N - or 13 C , 15 N - labelled protein , 100 mM KCl , 20 mM Bis - Tris ( pH 6 . 8 ) , 5 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 03 % NaN 3 , 0 . 5 mM DSS , and 10 mM 2 H - DTT in 99 . 99 % D 2 O or 10 % D 2 O / 90 % H 2 O . The calcium - bound non - labeled LPL - EF - H5 was also prepared in 99 . 99 % D 2 O with the same buffer ingredients . DSS was used as a reference to obtain 1 H , 15 N and 13 C chemical shifts . All NMR spectra were processed with NMRPipe 71 and analyzed using NMRView 72 . All NMR experiments were performed with a Bruker Avance 700 or 600 MHz spectrometer at 25 °C . Main - chain NMR signal assignments of the calcium - bound and the calcium - free LPL - EF - H5 , and calcium - free LPL - EF were completed with two - dimensional 1 H , 15 N - HSQC and three - dimensional HNCACB , CBCA ( CO ) NH , HN ( CA ) CO , HNCO , HNCA , and HN ( CO ) CA experiments . Aliphatic side - chain assignments were obtained by three - dimensional C ( CCO ) NH - TOCSY , H ( CCO ) HN - TOCSY , and HBHA ( CBCACO ) NH exper - iments . Aromatic side - chain assignments were achieved using two - dimensional ( HB ) CB ( CGCD ) HD and ( HB ) CB ( CGCDCE ) HE experiments . All NOESY experiments including three - dimensional 15 N - edited NOESY - HSQC and 13 C - edited NOESY - HSQC , and two - dimensional NOESY were measured with a mixing time of 120 ms . { 1 H } - 15 N heteronuclear NOE data were obtained using a 5 sec train of 120° proton pulses . Structure calculations . CYANA version 2 . 0 73 was used to calculate the structure of the calcium - free EF and the calcium - bound EF - H5 . This was done using distance restraints generated from the automated NOE assign - ment protocol implemented in CYANA . The dihedral angle restraints were predicted by TALOS + 74 , and hydro - gen bond restraints for α - helices were based on the secondary structure derived from the chemical shift index for the C α and C’ atoms . A total of 12 Ca 2 + - ligand restraints for the calcium - binding loops were also introduced according to the well - known Ca 2 + coordination geometry 53 , 54 . The 30 lowest - energy structures from a total of 200 were used for analysis . The program MOLMOL was used to generate the molecular graphics 75 . Isothermal titration calorimetry ( ITC ) . All ITC experiments were carried out on a Microcal VP - ITC microcalorimeter . 40 µ M LPL - EF or LPL - EF - H5 in calcium - free buffer containing 20 mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 2 ) , 100 mM KCl , and 1 mM Tris ( 2 - carboxyethyl ) phosphine , was injected with 1 . 2 mM CaCl 2 in the same buffer at 25 °C . Prior to each titration , the ITC sample cell was soaked in 5 mM EDTA solution , and was rinsed stringently www . nature . com / scientificreports / 10 Scientific RepoRts | 7 : 40662 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / srep40662 afterwards with calcium free buffer . The calcium free buffer was prepared via 1 week incubation with Chelex chelating agent . Each protein sample was exchanged into the calcium free buffer , and then passed through a Calcium Sponge S column ( Life Technologies ) . Data was fitted using the one or two site model , as applicable , with the MicroCal Origin software to obtain the stoichiometry ( N ) , affinity ( K ) , free enthalpy ( Δ H ) , and entropy ( Δ S ) values . Surface plasmon resonance ( SPR ) . The binding between Ca 2 + - bound LPL - EF and a synthetic peptide corresponding to H5 ( Ac - STDVAKTFRKAINKKEGI - NH2 ) was evaluated by SPR using a BIAcore X100 instru - ment ( GE Healthcare ) and was compared to other peptides including the cytotoxic peptide melittin , and the CaM - target CaMKI and smMLCK peptides . Peptides used here were purchased as synthetic peptides with > 95 % purity from Genscript ( San Diego , CA ) . The EF construct was immobilized via its sole cysteine residue ( Cys42 ) onto a CM5 sensor chip ( GE Healthcare ) using thiol - coupling . The running buffer contained 10 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM KCl , 1 mM CaCl 2 , and 0 . 005 % ( v / v ) Tween - 20 . Different concentrations of the peptide sample were injected at a flow rate of 30 µ L / min with a contact time of 1 min at 25 °C . The BIAevaluation software 2 . 0 ( GE Healthcare ) was used to process the SPR sensorgrams and for curve - fitting to obtain the dissociation constants ( K d ’s ) . Two different concentrations in each experiment were injected twice to obtain the fitting errors ( SEM ) . Actin - bundling assay . Human platelet actin ( Cytoskeleton ) was dissolved in 2 mM Tris pH7 . 5 , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , and 0 . 5 mM DTT ( Buffer G ) . The actin was then polymerized overnight at 4 °C in 20 mM Tris pH 7 . 5 , 100 mM KCl , and 1 mM MgCl 2 . Spontaneously bundled F - actin was removed by centrifugation at 12 , 000 g for 15 min prior to the assay . F - actin and LPL constructs were incubated at room temperature for 1 h in 50 uL of the buffer containing 20 mM Tris pH7 . 5 , 100 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 6 µ M F - actin , 3 µ M LPL construct , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 1 mM ATP with and without 5 mM EGTA . LPL induced actin bundles were sedimented by centrifuga - tion at 12 , 000 g for 15 min and the supernatant was carefully removed . The amount of actin and / or LPL construct in the pellet was analyzed by SDS - PAGE . The effect of the presence of 12 µ M melittin peptide on actin - bundling was also examined . Data Availability . The atomic coordinates , NMR constraints and resonance assignments have been depos - ited in the Protein Data Bank ( PDB IDs 5JOJ and 5JOL ) and the BMRB data base ( BMRB - 30071 and 30072 ) .
