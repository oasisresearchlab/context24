S1 G a A A b np mem sol     ( ) , ( S3 ) where A mem is the protein SASA in the membrane , A sol is the total protein SASA , a = 0 . 028 kcal / mol and b = (cid:2) 1 . 7 kcal / mol . These last two constants have been determined based on the partition - ing of small nonpolar molecules between aqueous and organic phases ( Sitkoff et al . , 1994 ) . SASA values are calculated with a modifi ed Shrake - Rupley algorithm ( Shrake and Rupley , 1973 ) us - ing the solvent - accessible surface representation of the protein with a water probe radius of 1 . 4 Å . In the presence of the mem - brane , if the point on the surface of the protein lies between the upper , u + , and lower , u (cid:2) , leafl ets then it is considered occluded and does not contribute to A mem . MATLAB’s cubic interpolation function was used to navigate between the position of the point on the protein surface and the grid points describing the upper and lower membrane surfaces . Search strategies Searches that are initiated from a fl at membrane must overcome a large nonpolar energy barrier to expose a central charged residue to aqueous solution . The red curve in Fig . S1 illustrates the diffi - culty that the original search algorithm has in crossing this barrier to solvate a central lysine residue on a hydrophobic leucine - alanine TM segment . At iteration 0 , the membrane is fl at and the insertion energy for the segment is (cid:2) 15 kcal / mol , whereas we know that the true minimum energy is below (cid:2) 40 kcal / mol ( see blue and green curves ) . Even after (cid:2) 3 , 000 iterations , the initial strategy fails to pro - mote suffi cient bending of the membrane to expose the lysine , re - sulting in unfavorable electrostatics . Our next approach was to ignore the nonpolar energy term in the cost function for the fi rst 50 iterations , thereby removing the nonpolar barrier and minimiz - ing the electrostatic energy component . Within the fi rst 50 itera - tions , the search identifi es large bent confi gurations that drop the total energy down below (cid:2) 20 kcal / mol by exposing the lysine ( green curve ) . By 1 , 000 iterations , the search has dropped below (cid:2) 40 kcal / mol and shows little improvement over the next 2 , 000 it - erations . The large spikes in the energy every 250 iterations are caused by the search algorithm attempting to cover the charged residue . Lastly , we started the search from two initial guesses that exposed the buried charged residue . First , the lower leafl et re - mained fl at and the shape of the upper leafl et was set to a pure si - nusoidal curve with a period of 2 (cid:3) and an amplitude and phase that placed the charged atoms in the polar headgroup region or solvent . This was then repeated for the bottom leafl et , and the shape that produced the lowest energy was used to initiate the Pow - ell’s - based search . The initial guess method signifi cantly outper - forms the other strategies in both its speed and ability to identify global minima as indicated by the blue curve in Fig . S1 . For all of the results presented in this manuscript , the initial guess strategy was used and produced the most energetically favorable solutions ; however , in many cases we ran all search strategies as a precaution . Comparison to existing residue insertion scales The construction of a hydrophobicity scale allows us to compare our method to a range of previous computational and experi - mental work . Our expectation was that optimizing the membrane confi guration would lead to lower insertion energies compared with our previous calculations , which posited simple contact curves ( Choe et al . , 2008 ) . This is important because experiments reveal relatively low insertion energy values compared with com - putational scales . As in previous studies ( Hessa et al . , 2005 ; Choe Supplemental text Electrostatic energy The electrostatic energy of the protein , G elec , is highly dependent on the local dielectric environment , and there is a large energetic cost for moving charged and polar residues into the membrane . We determine the electrostatic potential , (cid:4) , by solving the Pois - son - Boltzmann equation :      [ ( ) ( ) ] ( ) sinh [ ( ) ] ( ) ,      r r r r e k T r B 2 4 ( S1 ) where  = (cid:4) / k T B is the reduced electrostatic potential , (cid:5) is the Debye - Huckel screening coeffi cient to account for ionic shield - ing , (cid:6) is the spatially dependent dielectric constant , e is the elec - tron charge , and (cid:7) is the charge density within the protein . The energy is then given by : G dxdydz elec    . ( S2 ) In aqueous solution , (cid:6) was set to the value of water for all points outside of the protein molecular surface , whereas (cid:6) is modifi ed to take on values corresponding to the membrane for all spatial points between the upper surface , u + , and lower surface , u (cid:2) , de - termined from solving Eq . 2 in the main text . Additionally , (cid:5) is set to zero for points between u + and u (cid:2) , indicating a lack of counter - ion penetration into the membrane . (cid:8) G elec is then given by the dif - ference between the electrostatic energies calculated in bulk aqueous solution and in the presence of the membrane . The headgroup regions were defi ned as all points 8 Å from the upper or lower membrane surfaces . For positions r within the headgroup regions , (cid:6) ( r ) was set to a high dielectric of 80 , whereas the ion accessibility (cid:5) ( r ) was set to zero . A detailed description of the manipulations to the microenvironment of the protein in the presence of the membrane can be found in our original manu - script ( Choe et al . , 2008 ) , and in our recent publication support - ing our electrostatics software package APBSmem ( Callenberg et al . , 2010 ) . Because the points describing the membrane surface were on a different grid than those used for the APBS calculations , we used the cubic interpolation function in MATLAB to move between grids . The linearized Poisson - Boltzmann equation was used for all calculations reported here ; however , we performed test runs us - ing the full nonlinear equation . The electrostatic component of the energy varied < 0 . 2 kcal / mol for individual calculations , but when performing a search for optimal bending , the fi nal electro - static energy varied by up to 0 . 7 kcal / mol . During the search , the electrostatics grid spacing was set to 0 . 77 Å for increased speed . Once the lowest energy membrane shape was identifi ed , a fi nal electrostatics calculation was performed us - ing a grid spacing of 0 . 31 Å for greater accuracy . For searches that used the fi ner discretization from the start , fi nal energy values dif - fered by 0 . 3 kcal / mol or less . Nonpolar energy The nonpolar energy coming from the tendency of water to ex - clude molecules results in a large stabilizing force for proteins in the membrane . We model it by assuming that the energy differ - ence of the protein in solution compared with the protein in the membrane , G np , is proportional to the difference in the protein’s solvent accessible surface area ( SASA ) : S U P P L E M E N TA L M AT E R I A L Callenberg et al . , http : / / www . jgp . org / cgi / content / full / jgp . 201110766 / DC1 S2 To be added numbers of arginine residues were calculated in CHARMM c32b2 using the molecular surface representation , a bilayer thickness of 42 Å , a membrane dielectric of 2 , a solvent dielectric of 80 , and an effective surface tension coeffi cient of 0 . 005 . We used the same set of parameter values to carry out the comparison calculations using our method . The peptide’s atomic radii were taken from the radius _ gbsw set , which was calibrated for GBSW calculations ( Nina et al . , 1997 ; Chen et al . , 2006 ) . A membrane - switching length of 2 . 5 Å was used . The default values were used for all other GBSW parameters . Briefl y , we performed an electrostatic point calculation in the presence of the membrane , and then we performed the same point calculation in solution using an exter - nal dielectric value of 80 everywhere outside the protein . The electrostatic component of the insertion energy was recorded as the difference between these two energies . S U P P L E M E N TA L R E F E R E N C E S Botelho , S . C . , M . Osterberg , A . S .

We determined the apparent free energy of insertion for each amino acid by fi nding the difference in the two peptides’ insertion energies and subtracting the insertion en - ergy of an individual leucine , (cid:2) 3 . 6 kcal / mol , which was calcu - lated as described in our previous work ( Choe et al . , 2008 ) . As shown in Fig . S2 , our revised scale is consistent with the over - all trend of experiments that fi nds hydrophobic residues most sta - ble in the membrane and polar and charged residues less stable . The magnitude and spread of the energy values remain the same between our current results and our original work ( Choe et al . , 2008 ) , but importantly , our new algorithm outperforms the origi - nal model for all amino acids , predicting charged residue insertion energies to be 1 – 2 kcal / mol lower . Although the rank ordering of our scale is similar to a recent experiment on peptide insertion in the inner mitochondrial membrane ( Botelho et al . , 2011 ) , our pre - dicted values are still more in line with computational results ( Mac - Callum et al . , 2007 ) than the low values reported by the translocon studies ( Hessa et al . , 2005 , 2007 ) . Visualization of the system geom - etry revealed that the membrane signifi cantly bends around cen - tral charged residues but remains fl at when polar and hydrophobic amino acids are inserted . As we previously reported , charged lysine and polar asparagine have comparable insertion energies , although the cost of inserting asparagine is primarily electrostatic because the membrane does not bend , whereas the cost of inserting lysine is largely nonpolar because the membrane bends to expose large regions of the TM segment . We also tested the effect that the material properties of the membrane had on the scale . In separate calculations , we reduced the compression modulus ( K a ) , bending modulus ( K c ) , and stretch ( (cid:9) ) parameters to 1 / 2 of their normal value and , in each case , the insertion energy scale was only mildly impacted . The charged residue values were most affected , becoming 0 . 5 kcal / mol easier to insert ( data not shown ) . Context dependence of hydrophobicity scales A biological hydrophobicity scale was reconstructed using a TM segment with different fl anking residues ( yellow bars in Fig . S2 ) . We replaced the N - and C - terminal fl anking glycine residues , simi - lar to the H - segment studied by Hessa et al . ( 2005 ) , with a charged sequence , NNKK . . . KKNN , typical of amino acid sequences at the membrane – water interface . As shown in the bar chart , most of the Helix 2 insertion energies are within 1 kcal / mol of the origi - nal values ( dark green ) ; however , glutamate , aspartate , lysine , and arginine all destabilize the new segment 2 – 7 kcal / mol more than they destabilize the original segment . This destabilization is predominantly caused by a large increase in the solvent - accessible surface area . In the new reference pep - tide , in which the central amino acid is a leucine , the membrane remains fl at and the lysine residues are buried in the headgroup region . This is an energetically favorable confi guration because it reduces the SASA of the TM segment while allowing the charged lysines to interact favorably with polar lipid headgroups . When the central amino acid is replaced by a charged residue , the mem - brane bends to expose the NNKK sequence to water , resulting in a much greater nonpolar energy penalty than incurred for the original GGGG sequence , due to the larger size of lysines and asparagines . Comparison with Generalized Born We wanted to compare our continuum method for computing the energetics of membrane proteins to other continuum meth - ods that use Generalized Born methods along with modifi cations to model the membrane . We chose the CHARMM GBSW module , which is an extremely popular method in the fi eld ( Im et al . , 2003a , b ) . Insertion energies for TM helices harboring varying Callenberget al . S3 Figure S2 . Biological hydrophobicity scale for inserting all - natural amino ac - ids ( except proline ) in the center of a TM helix . Our search algorithm ( dark green ) identifi es insertion energies that are lower than manual guesses from our previous work ( light green ) when using the same Helix 1 peptides ( H - segments ) fl anked by four glycine residues ( Choe et al . , 2008 ) . Charged amino acids ( K , E , D , and R ) are 2 – 7 kcal / mol more destabilizing to Helix 2 peptides ( yellow bars ) , which are fl anked by polar asparagines and charged lysines . All 3 scales were shifted by + 2 . 04 kcal / mol to set the alanine in - sertion energy to zero for the current method . Figure S1 . Three different search strategies . We at - tempted to minimize the total insertion energy of a hydrophobic helix with a central charged lysine . The original search strategy has the membrane start from a fl at , unstressed state . The height value of the con - tact curve nodes shown in Fig . 1 C were then used as independent parameters in the Powell’s search strat - egy . After nearly 3 , 000 iterations of the search strat - egy , the total energy has been reduced by only a few kcal / mol because of the inability to cross a high - en - ergy barrier of exposing hydrophobic residues to solvent before uncovering the lysine ( red curve ) . The modifi ed nonpolar search strategy disregards the nonpolar energy for the fi rst 50 iterations to overcome the barrier and expose the central charged residue to water after (cid:2) 1 , 000 iterations ( green curve ) . The initial guess search strategy starts from a distorted contact curve that already exposes the bur - ied charged residue to water ( blue curve ) . This method quickly identifi es a membrane confi gura - tion that is a few kcal / mol more stable than the non - polar method .
