Different mechanisms for plasma mem - brane repair have been described in a variety of cellular models , including patching with endo - membranes , endocytosis , and extracellular budding . We found that the endosomal sorting complex required for transport ( ESCRT ) , which is implicated in numerous membrane ﬁ ssion events ( such as during cytokinesis or for the budding of several viruses ) was also required for the rapid closure of small wounds made at the plasma membrane . Methods : We used micropipettes , detergents , pore - forming toxins , and laser wounding to damage the plasma membrane of mammalian cells in tissue culture . Ultraviolet or two - photon lasers were used to induce small , localized wounds , and cell reactions were followed with time - lapse imaging . Propidium iodide ( PI ) entry in wounded cells was used to allow imaging of the plasma membrane opening and to quantify the rate of closure of single wounds . Mathematical ﬁ t of PI entry kinetics was used to estimate the diameter and the rate of closure of individual wounds . Characterization of PI ﬂ uorescence and diffusion gave us an estimation of wound sizes . Transfection of small interfering RNA or dominant - negative mutants of ESCRT subunits allowed us to assess their importance during plasma membrane repair . Last , using correlative scanning electron microscopy we examined the ultrastructure of wounded plasma membranes . Results : The various wounding methods used here revealed a systematic recruitment of ESCRTs to the plasma membrane . Wounding with a laser beam showed that ESCRTs—and in particular , ESCRT - III proteins—were speciﬁ cally recruited to wound sites and were accumulated until wound closure . This recruitment depended on calcium , which is known to be a crucial signaling molecule for wound repair . The depletion of important ESCRT subunits such as CHMP4B , CHMP2A , or Vps4 was deleterious for a subpopulation of cells bearing small wounds ( less than 100 nm in diameter ) . Correlative scanning electron microscopy and time - lapse imaging revealed that wounding was followed by ESCRT - positive membrane budding and shedding . Energy depletion did not prevent—and rather increased—ESCRT accumulation but prevented both membrane shedding and repair . Discussion : These results show that ESCRT proteins play an important role in the detection and removal through the extracellular shedding of small wounds present at the plasma membrane . We propose that different mechanisms for membrane repair ( patching , budding , or endocytosis ) can be used by cells depending on the type and size of the wound . These mechanisms are stimulated by common early signaling events , such as calcium , but downstream events are likely to depend on the physiochemical characteristics of the wounds . ESCRT - positive plasma membrane shedding has been observed in a variety of normal and patho - logical conditions . It remains unclear whether these phenomena are linked to local plasma membrane damage and whether ESCRT - III proteins are involved in these processes . FIGURES IN THE FULL ARTICLE Fig . 1 .

Endocytosis , membrane patching , or extracellular budding can be used for plasma membrane repair . We found that endosomal sorting complex required for transport ( ESCRT ) , involved previously in membrane budding and fission , plays a critical role in plasma membrane repair . ESCRT proteins were recruited within seconds to plasma membrane wounds . Quantitative analysis of wound closure kinetics coupled to mathematical modeling suggested that ESCRTs are involved in the repair of small wounds . Real - time imaging and correlative scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) identified extracellular buds and shedding at the site of ESCRT recruitment . Thus , the repair of certain wounds is ensured by ESCRT - mediated extracellular shedding of wounded portions . E ndosomal sorting complex required for transport ( ESCRT ) has been implicated in multivesicular body ( MVB ) biogenesis , viral budding , cytokinesis , and spontaneous bud - ding of the plasma membrane ( 1 ) . They are in - volvedinlocalmembranedeformationandscission . The topology of the bent membrane is very char - acteristic , with its concave side facing the cy - toplasm . ESCRT subunits are classified in five complexes : ESCRT - 0 , ESCRT - I , ESCRT - II , ESCRT - III , and ESCRT disassembly subcomplex , which are recruited in a serial fashion during MVB biogenesis ( 2 – 4 ) . ESCRT - III and ESCRT disas - sembly proteins appear to be involved in every ESCRT - associatedfunction . ESCRT - 0andESCRT - II have not been implicated in cytokinesis and are dispensable during viral budding ( 5 , 6 ) . It is like - lythatadaptorproteinssuch asALG - 2 – interacting protein X ( ALIX ) can fulfill the role of ESCRT - II for the recruitment of the ESCRT - III machinery ( 5 , 7 – 14 ) . Extracellular budding events have been de - scribed during cellular response to plasma mem - brane wounding by pore - forming toxins ( 15 , 16 ) . Because the topology of these budded membranes was reminiscent of ESCRT - dependent membrane deformation , we decided to explore the role of ESCRTs in plasma membrane repair . WefirstanalyzedthebehavioroftheESCRT - III complex upon localized plasma membrane dam - age . We followed the dynamics of CHMP4B , an ESCRT - IIIproteinnecessaryforallknownESCRT functions in mammals . The plasma membrane of HeLa cells was wounded using three different means . In the first assay , we incubated HeLa cells expressing CHMP4B - EGFP ( enhanced green flu - orescent protein ) at endogenous levels ( 17 ) , with two pore - forming molecules ( digitonin at 250 m M or saponin at 0 . 05 % ) added to the cells for a short time . In both cases , we observed a redistribution of cytosolic CHMP4B - EGFP to localized spots at the cell membrane less than 3 min after the ad - dition of the pore - forming molecules ( Fig . 1A ) . Similarresultswere obtainedwith the pore - forming toxins streptolysin O and listeriolysin O ( Fig . 1B ) . Second , we mechanically damaged the plasma membrane using a micropipette in a standard RESEARCH ARTICLE 1 Institut Curie , 26 rue d ’ Ulm , 75248 Paris Cedex 05 , France . 2 CNRSUMR144 , 26rued ’ Ulm , 75248ParisCedex05 , France . * These authors contributed equally to this work . † Corresponding author .

( A to C ) HeLa cells stably expressing CHMP4B - EGFP at endogenous levels ( re - ferred below as HeLa CHMP4B - EGFP ) were used . Cells were treated with digitonin or saponin for 1 min and fixed for 3 min after the beginning of the treatment ( A ) or were treated with streptolysin O or listeriolysin O for 2 . 5 min before fixation ( B ) . Cells were fixed and immunolabeled with antibodies to GFP ( for better visualization of CHMP4B - EGFP recruitment ) ( A to C ) . Plasma membrane wounding with a glass needle ( highlighted with dashed lines ) was followed by differential interference contrast ( DIC ) microscopy imaging , and CHMP4B - EGFP re - cruitment was observed by confocal microscopy in 6of20cellsanalyzed ( C ) . ( D ) HeLacellscotransfected withCHMP4B - mCherryandMyrPalm - EGFPconstructs were wounded at the plasma membrane with a UV laser / spinning disc microscope system .

Similarly , CHMP4B - EGFP wasrecruited to the wounded site in HeLa cells in about 25 % of the cells analyzed ( n = 20 ) ( Fig . 1C ) . Finally , to standardize wounding conditions and to couple localized plasma membrane dam - age to fast imaging of the cellular response , we performed laser - based plasma membrane wound - ing . We used either a scanning confocal micro - scope equipped with a two - photon laser or a spinning disc confocal microscope equipped with an ultraviolet ( UV ) laser . These experiments re - vealed a very fast ( less than 30 s ) and localized recruitment of CHMP4B - EGFP to wounded domains ( Figs . 1D and 2 , A and C ) . CHMP4B was found on the damaged plasma membrane colocalizing with the plasma membrane marker pMyrPalmEGFP ( Fig . 1D ) . ESCRT - III subunits have been observed before at the plasma membrane when overexpressed or when lacking autoinhib - itory domains ( 18 , 19 ) and during viral budding or uncharacterized nonviral budding events ( 1 ) . Certain ESCRT - III subunits , such as CHMP3 , bind with high affinity to phosphatidylinositol 3 , 4 - bisphosphate , a lipid exclusively produced at the plasma membrane ( 20 ) . Because lysosomes / late endosomes ( LLEs ) were found to be involved in plasma membrane repair ( 21 , 22 ) and because ESCRT proteins are involved in LLE functions , we tested whether CHMP4 was transported by LLE to the wounded area of the plasma membrane . Cells expressing CHMP4B - EGFP were immu - nostained with endolysosomal markers [ lyso - bis - phosphatidic acid ( LBPA ) , lysosomal - associated membrane protein 1 ( Lamp1 ) , and early endosome antigen 1 ( EEA1 ) ] after localized laser wounding to look for approaching endolysosomal vesicles . No LBPA , Lamp1 , or EEA1 vesicular structures were detectable close to the wound in conditions where CHMP4 was strongly recruited ( fig . S1 ) . As reported before ( 22 ) , however , the presence of Lamp1 can be revealed by surface staining at the wound ( fig . S2A ) . However , the recruitment of ESCRTs at the wound in cells with depolymer - ized microtubules suggests that it is mainly inde - pendent of vesicular transport ( fig . S2B ) . This is further suggested by the fact that recruitment of CHMP4B onwoundsiteswasenergy - independent ( see below ) . These data suggest that soluble ESCRT - III pro - teins are directly targeted to physical holes present at the plasma membrane , where they may be in - volved in repair . The disruption of the membrane and the closure of the wound were monitored fol - lowing the entry of the impermeant nucleic acid dye propidium iodide ( PI ) into wounded cells . Re - versible physical damage upon laser - based wounding can be efficiently followed in real time , quantify - ing cellular PI fluorescence . CHMP4B recruitment was triggered by single or sequential and spatial - ly distinct laser wounds ( Fig . 2 , A to C , and movie S1 ) . The suitability of PI to monitor wound open - ing and repair was confirmed by comparing PI with other dyes ( fig . S3 ) . Using PI as a tracer , or other fluorescent dyes , we observed that wounds could stay open for a few hundreds of seconds ( Fig . 2B and fig . S3 ) . This was further confirmed by adding PI to the cells at different time points afterwounding , whichindicatedthatsome wounds remainedopenupto4min ( fig . S4 ) . Therecruitment Fig . 2 .

Furthermore , we calculated the difference between the time of closure ( time of reach of the PI plateau ) and the time of maximum recruitment of CHMP4B , which was not statistically different from 0 , strongly sug - gestingthatthese twoeventsarecorrelated ( Fig . 2E ) . Thus , as soon as the wound closes , ESCRT - III starts to dissociate from the wounded area . We next investigated whether other subunits of the ESCRT - III subcomplex were involved in this targeted response . Immunostaining of digitonin - treated cells revealed that , upon damage , endog - enous CHMP3 , CHMP2A , and CHMP2B , but not CHMP6 , colocalized with CHMP4B - EGFP at the plasma membrane ( Fig . 3 , A to C , E , and F , and fig . S5 ) . Proteins from other ESCRT sub - complexes , such as hepatocyte growth factor – regulated tyrosine kinase substrate ( HRS ) , were not detected ( fig . S6A ) , although recruitment of overexpressed and endogenous TSG101 was ob - served ( fig . S6 , B and C ) . We investigated wheth - er ALIX , a protein capable of bypassing ESCRT - 0 , ESCRT - I , and ESCRT - II complexes and recruit - ingESCRT - IIIproteinsdirectly , wasinvolvedinthe recruitmentofESCRT - IIIproteins . ALIXcolocalized with CHMP4B - EGFP at the plasma membrane of cells treated with digitonin ( Fig . 3D ) or wounded with a laser beam ( Fig . 4C ) . Polyubiquitination of the plasma membrane wounded by a laser or by digitonin was observed by immunofluorescence ( fig . S7 ) . Its belated detection befogs the role of ubiquitin as a potential early signal for ESCRT recruitment via ubiquitin - binding domains ( 23 , 24 ) . Nevertheless , although we cannot exclude that the belated detection is due to a limited antibody sensitivity , the presence of ESCRTs at the wound sites in the absence of energy , as described below , argues in favor of ubiquitin - independent recruit - ment of ESCRTs . Calcium , an essential molecule for wound repair ( 25 ) , is likely to be involved in early signaling of membrane damage and stimu - late the local recruitment of ESCRTs . As ex - pected , calcium depletion enhanced cell necrosis when cells were wounded with a laser ( Fig . 4A and fig . S8 ) . These conditions also strongly in - hibited ESCRT recruitment ( Fig . 4B ) . This ar - gues for a role of calcium entry at wounded sites in the local recruitment of ESCRT . Accordingly , the recruitment of ALIX mutants lacking calcium - binding domain ( 26 ) ( as well as lipid - binding mutants ) was strongly impaired as compared to a control mutant or wild - type proteins ( Fig . 4 , C and D ) . Thus , calcium plays a major , and early , role in the direct recruitment of ESCRTs to the wounded plasma membrane , but the presence of both ALIX and TSG101 suggests that redun - dant pathways may be involved in the recruitment of ESCRTs at the wounded plasma membranes . The lipid - binding domain of ALIX has been de - scribed by Bissig et al . ( 26 ) as an LBPA - specific lipid - binding domain . Nevertheless , this study only considers lipids present on MVBs . Our data suggest that ALIX can bind to the plasma mem - brane through its LBPA - binding domain , sug - gesting that this domain can also bind other lipids present at the plasma membrane , or that LBPA might be transiently present at the wounded plas - ma membrane . This finding opens research per - spectives concerning ALIX binding properties . Finally , we analyzed the recruitment of the AAA + adenosine triphosphatase Vps4 ( respon - sible for the disassembly of ESCRT - III polymers ) and also observed the rapid kinetics of recruit - ment ( fig . S9 and movie S2 ) . The timing for Vps4 recruitment and removal from the wounding site was very close to that of CHMP4B recruitment and removal . We did not detect other markers such as annexin A1 that have previously been detected in streptolysin O wounds ( 16 ) . We then asked whether the ESCRT machin - ery was recruited at the wounded area following the classical sequential order of events described Fig . 3 . CHMP2 , CHMP3 , and the ESCRT - associated protein ALIX are recruited to wounds . ( A to D ) HeLa CHMP4B - EGFP cells were treated with digitonin and immunostained for CHMP2B ( A ) , CHMP3 ( B ) ( 37 ) , CHMP6 ( C ) , and ALIX ( D ) ( 38 ) . Intensity measurements of CHMP4B - EGFP and the other ESCRT subunits were performed along the lines highlighted at the plasma membrane edge and are represented as intensity spectrums . ( E and F ) HeLa CHMP4B - EGFP ( E ) or HeLa ( F ) cells were wounded and imaged with a spinning disc microscope equipped with a UV laser . Cells were fixed 2 min after wounding and immunostained for CHMP2A . EGFP signal was enhanced in all experiments as before . White arrows point at the wound where CHMP4B - EGFP is recruited .

CHMP2 proteins , in interaction with Vps4 , are necessary to recruit the ESCRT disassembly com - plex ( 2 , 3 , 27 – 30 ) . In control cells , CHMP4B - EGFP local accumulation reached a plateau about 2 to 4 min after wounding and then started to decrease right after wound closure ( see Fig . 2 , B to D ) . In contrast , in CHMP2A knockdown cells , CHMP4B continued accumulating up to three times more at the wounded site and reached a plateau only 15 min after wounding ( Fig . 5 , A and B , fig . S10A , and movie S3 ) . This suggests that ESCRT - III recruitment is the result of a dy - namic equilibrium between the assembly and disassembly of the complex on the wound . Knock - down of CHMP3 had a similar , albeit milder , ef - fect on CHMP4B accumulation ( figs . S10B and S11A ) , suggesting a role for CHMP3 in the dis - assembly of ESCRT - III machinery . To better understand the role of ESCRT - III proteins in plasma membrane repair processes , wefollowedthe openingandclosureof thewound by recording and quantifying the kinetics of entry of PI into wounded cells . A simple model of wound closure was established , and the curves of PI entry after cell damage were fitted using this model . Successive wounding of the same cell showed that the plateau of PI entry reached after each damage was caused by wound closure and not by saturation of PI labeling and thus could be used when fitting the curves ( Fig . 2C and fig . S12 ) . Quantitative information about the initial radius of the hole in the plasma membrane ( R eff ) and its rate of closure ( v ) could be estimated using the model ( see details in supplementary materials and methods and fig . S12 ) . Laser - based plasma membrane damage led to a diversity in wound size ( see the cumulative distribution in fig . S13 ) . When we plotted closing rate values against the relative wound size , closure rates increased with wound size . However , two modes were apparent : one for relatively smaller R eff ( smaller holes ) , where rates increased rapidly in function of R eff , and one for relatively larger R eff ( larger holes ) , where closing rate increased more moderately . This suggested that different mechanisms may be used depending on wound sizes . Indeed , inhibition of CHMP2A affected only the closure rate of relatively small holes with no impact on wound size distribution ( Fig . 5 , C and D , and fig . S13 , A and B ) , whereas no ef - fect was observed for larger holes ( fig . S12B ) . Using quantitative microscopy and calculation , we could estimate that ESCRTs play a role in the repair of wounds of less than 100 nm ( fig . S14 ) . No effect on v could be detected upon treatment of cells with small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) against CHMP3 ( figs . S10B and S11 , C and D ) . ESCRT - III function was further perturbed by transfecting the dominant - negative ( DN ) mu - tant Vps4B E223Q ( 31 ) or by treating cells with an siRNA targeting CHMP4B ( 32 ) ( for siRNA efficiency , see fig . S10C ) . These treatments inhib - it ESCRT - III activity : CHMP4B is the main com - ponent of ESCRT - III filaments ( 33 ) , and Vps4B DN blocks depolymerization of ESCRTsubunits and therefore their recycling ( 3 ) . In these con - ditions , we did not detect a reduction in the rate of closure . However , when we plotted the distri - bution of wound size , we observed that pertur - bation of Vps4B or CHMP4B functions leads to a reduction in the number of cells displaying a relatively smaller wound ( fig . S13 , C and D ) . No such effect was seen upon inhibition of CHMP2A orCHMP3 ( figs . S11BandS13A ) . Thissuggested that , upon perturbation of Vps4B or CHMP4B functions , cells with smaller wounds did not sur - vive and , thus , could not be analyzed . Accord - ingly , we observed a significant reduction of cell survival upon laser wounding in these condi - tions , in comparison to cells treated with a con - trol siRNA or overexpressing wild - type Vps4B ( Fig . 5E ) . Thiswasconsistentwiththe higherlevels of PI entry observed ( Fig . 5F ) . This indicates that ESCRT - III activity is essential for cell survival after plasma membrane damage and suggests that the importance of ESCRT - III role in repair is re - lated to the size of the wound . Our observations indicate that ESCRT - III pro - teins are rapidly , specifically , and dynamically recruited to damaged areas of the plasma mem - brane to quickly repair the defect . Knowing the usual topology of ESCRTactivity , this suggests a modelwherebyESCRTproteinswouldbeinvolvedinextracellularbuddingofthedamagedareaandsealingoftheplasmamembrane . To directly test this model by observing the wound site at high resolution , we set up a correl - ative scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) assay to ( i ) get a spatiotemporal control of the wound driven by a laser , ( ii ) observe CHMP4B - EGFP dynamics and specific recruitment , and ( iii ) ob - tain a high - resolution image of the zone where CHMP4B - EGFP was recruited . The surface of Fig . 4 . ESCRT - III proteins and the ESCRT - associated protein ALIX are recruited in a calcium - dependent manner . HeLa CHMP4B - EGFP cells were incubated in media with or without calcium and supplemented with BAPTA [ 1 , 2 - bis ( 2 - aminophenoxy ) ethane - N , N , N ′ , N ′ - tetraacetic acid ] or EGTA . Both media were supplemented with PI at 160 m g / ml . Laser wounding was performed with a UV laser mounted on a spinning disc microscope . Cells were examined for necrosis after wounding on the basis of morphology by transmission light and levels of PI ( see fig . S8 ) . ( A ) Surviving and necrotic cells were quantified .

The recruitment of CHMP4B - EGFP was followed by fluorescence time - lapse imaging ( Fig . 6A ) . Lateral projection of image stacks showed that CHMP4B was recruited on plasma membrane protrusions ( Fig . 6B ) . Cells imaged by time - lapse microscopy were then fixed andobservedbySEM ( n = 6 ) . Low - magnification observation allowed the detection of wounded areas ( Fig . 6C ) . At higher magnification , a clus - ter of extracellular buds of various size was de - tected on damaged zones and could be aligned with CHMP4B - EGFP – positive areas ( Fig . 6 , D to F ) . This suggested that ESCRT - III proteins were involved in extracellular budding at wounded sites . We observed ESCRT - positive membrane shedding at the cell surface at wounded sites using time - lapse confocal microscopy ( Fig . 7A , fig . S15 , and movie S5 ) . Accordingly , using spinning disc confocal time - lapse microscopy and SEM , we ob - served that CHMP4B - EGFP – positive buds were accompanied with shedding ( fig . S16 ) . Both mem - brane repair and ESCRT - positive shedding were adenosine 5 ′ - triphosphate ( ATP ) – dependent mech - anisms ( Fig . 7 , B to E , and movie S6 ) . ESCRT recruitment itself still occurred in the absence of energy , but pinching of the membrane was only observed when energy production was restored ( Fig . 7C and fig . S17 ) . Thus , ESCRT shedding itself appears necessary for the wound closure , and ATP - dependent mechanisms , most likely the ESCRT disassembly machinery , may also be re - quired to resolve the neck constriction , bud detach - ment , and wound closure . The precise mechanisms that allow cells to rapidly detect wounds at the plasma membrane will need further investigation , but our results indicate a key role played by calcium increase . In addition , time - lapse imaging of CHMP4B recruit - ment led to an intriguing observation : We often noticed that plasma membrane wounding was followed by the rapid formation of a localized bleb of a few micrometers in diameter . The bleb rapidlybecamepositiveforCHMP4B - EGFP ( Fig . 6G ) . Astheblebregressed , thestainingofCHMP4B - EGFP became denser . Previous studies have re - vealed that events lowering membrane tension ( such as exocytosis and local removal of the actin cytoskeleton ) occur upon wounding of the plas - ma membrane ( 34 ) . On the basis of these studies and our observations , we thus propose a model whereby a lesion in the plasma membrane trig - gers a local drop in membrane tension reinforced by local membrane supply through exocytosis and / or cytoskeleton remodeling . This drop in ten - sion together with calcium entry would promote ALIX and ESCRT - III local recruitment . Other signals such as ubiquitination of proteins at the wound site or loss of lipid asymmetry and the recruitment of lipid - binding proteins may re - inforce this binding . The assembly of ESCRT - III into helix - shaped filaments would then trap the damaged portions of plasma membrane on buds , shed them from the plasma membrane , and Fig . 5 .

Rapidbinding of ESCRT proteins may also prevent extension of the wound and enhance cell survival . Although these mechanisms would be sufficient to explain localized membrane repair , it may be associated with other mechanisms described previously , such as patching of membrane gaps with intracellular vesicles ( fig .

The size of the gap may dic - tate the choice of the mechanism involved for repair because the patching model has clearly been demonstrated for larger wounds and because we observed critical involvement of ESCRT - III proteins to repair wounds smaller than 100 nm . Thesewoundswereratherlong - lastingascompared to what has been observed for larger wounds . In conclusion , plasma membrane integrity is essential for cell homeostasis and survival . We propose that ESCRT - III proteins play a central role in repairing local injuries by ensuring extra - cellular shedding of damaged areas . Plasma mem - brane shedding , sometimes positive for ESCRTs , has been observed in several normal and path - ological conditions ( 35 , 36 ) , and it will now be important to test whether this is linked to local plasma membrane damage and whether ESCRT - III proteins are involved in these processes .
