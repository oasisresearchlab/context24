Two regions of laminins — three laminin globular domains of the a chain ( LG1 – 3 ) and the carboxyl - terminal tail of the g chain ( g - tail ) — are re - quired for integrin binding , but it remains unclear how the g - tail contributes to the binding . We determined the crystal structure of the integrin binding fragment of laminin - 511 , showing that the g - tail extends to the bottom face of LG1 – 3 . Electron microscopic imaging combined with biochemical analyses showed that integrin binds to the bottom face of LG1 – 3 with the g 1 - tail apposed to the metal ion – dependent adhesion site ( MIDAS ) of integrin b 1 . These findings are consistent with a model in which the g - tail coordinates the metal ion in the MIDAS through its Glu residue . INTRODUCTION Adhesion of cells to the basement membrane ( BM ) is a fundamental biological process essential for tissue development and maintenance . Laminins make a major contribution to the cell - adhesive activity of theBM andelicita varietyofcellular responses through interaction with a panel of cell surface receptors , including integrins . Laminins consist of three chains , a , b , and g , which assemble into a cross - shaped heterotri - mer . In mammals , 11 laminin chains ( a 1 to a 5 , b 1 to b 3 , and g 1 to g 3 ) and 16 combinations of these have been identified ( 1 ) . Laminin - 511 ( LM511 ) , an isoform consisting of chains a 5 , b 1 , and g 1 , is expressed in the early embryonic stage and maintains tissue homeostasis through - out life ( 2 ) . Integrins are heterodimeric membrane proteins composed of noncovalently associated a and b subunits ( 3 ) . Twenty - four integrins have been identified in mammals ; among these , a 6 b 1 integrin exhibits the highest binding affinity for the a 5 chain – containing laminin iso - forms LM511 and LM521 ( 4 ) . The integrin binding activity of laminin has been mapped within the “ E8 ” segment , comprising the distal part of the coiled - coil domain and threelamininglobulardomains ( LG1 – 3 ) ofthe a chain ( Fig . 1A , middle ) . LG1 – 3 , which are prerequisite for integrin binding ( 5 – 7 ) , have been proposed to adopt a “ cloverleaf ” configuration based on electron micro - scopic observations ( 8 ) , although LG1 – 3 alone adopted an open configuration when their structure was determined by x - ray crystallog - raphy ( 9 ) . LG1 – 3 alone have no significant integrin binding activity ( 10 ) , suggesting that b and / or g chains facilitate the cloverleaf assembly of LG1 – 3 for integrin recognition . Our previous results showed that the Glu residue at the third posi - tion from the C terminus of the g chain is crucial for integrin binding ( 11 , 12 ) . However , it remains to be determined whether this Glu residue in the C - terminal region of the g chain ( designated the g - tail ) contributes to adopting an active LG1 – 3 conformation for integrin recognition or directly interacts with integrins by coordinating the metal ion held in the major ligand - binding site of integrins . This site is referred to as the MIDAS ( metal ion – dependent adhesion site ) . Here , we sought to determine the role of the g - tail in the laminin - integrin interaction by x - ray crystallography combined with electron micro - scopic imaging and a series of biochemical analyses . RESULTS Crystal structure of the integrin binding region of LM511 Through a series of truncation / deletion mutagenesis experiments coupled with evaluation of the integrin binding activity , we identified a truncated LM511E8 ( tLM511E8 ) suitable for the structural determi - nation , which was successfully crystallized and whose structure was determined at 1 . 8 Å resolution ( fig . S1 and table S1 ) . The structure of tLM511E8 exhibited a “ ladle ” shape with LG1 – 3 adopting a compact triangular cloverleaf configuration , where LG1 was in direct contact with LG3 ( Fig . 1 , A and C ) . Each LG adopts a canonical b - sandwich fold stabilized by a conserved disulfide bridge typical for this class of domain . We found one calcium ion at the LG1 - LG3 interface ( Fig . 1B ) , where its octahedrally coordinating ligands were provided by both LG1 ( four ligands ) and LG3 ( one ligand ) , as well as one water molecule . The overall arrangement of LG1 – 3 is in sharp contrast to that seen in the same fragment of a 2 chain previously reported in isolation , which adopted an open configuration with LG1 completely dissociated from LG3 ( 9 ) . Thus , the cloverleaf assembly of LG1 – 3 in tLM511E8 should have been brought about by the heterotrimeric assembly of the a 5 chain with a b 1 - g 1 dimer , rather than by the direct contact between LG1 and LG3 ( Fig . 1D ) . Notably , LG1 and LG2 clamp the C - terminal region of the b 1 - g 1dimer ( Fig . 2A ) . LG1containsahydrophobicpatchconsisting ofresidues V2733 , V2735 , P2736 , Y2913 , F2915 , L2921 , and P2928 ( Fig . 2B ) . Following the heterotrimeric assembly , the hydrophobic patch is brought into directcontact with the side chains of Y1782 of the b 1 chain and L1596 / P1597 / F1601 of the g 1 chain . As a result , LG1 is fastened to the C - terminal region of the b 1 - g 1 dimer through hydrophobic side - chain interactions ( Fig . 2C ) . LG2 faces the b 1 chain pillar from the opposite side , but there are no obvious side - chain interactions at the interface . Instead , water molecules fill the gap by forming a hydrogen - bonded network and secure the contacts of LG2 with the b 1 - g 1 dimer ( Fig . 2D ) . Thus , heterotrimeric assembly may impose conformational restriction on LG1 and LG2 to appose the b 1 chain pillar and lead to the cloverleaf assembly of LG1 – 3 . It has been proposed that the Glu residue in the g - tail associates with LG1 – 3 to ensure their functional triangular assembly ( 5 ) . However , the five C - terminal residues of the g 1 chain , including E1607 ( g 1E1607 ) , 1 Division of Matrixome Research and Application , Institute for Protein Research , Osaka University , 3 - 2 Yamadaoka , Suita , Osaka 565 - 0871 , Japan . 2 Laboratory of Protein Synthesis and Expression , Institute for Protein Research , Osaka University , Suita , Osaka 565 - 0871 , Japan . * These authors contributed equally to this work . † Corresponding author .

Adv . 2017 ; 3 : e1701497 1 September 2017 1 of 8 which is the critical residue for integrin binding , are disordered in our structure and have no direct contact with LG1 – 3 ( Fig . 2 and fig . S2B ) , strongly arguing against its role in stabilizing the functionally active conformation of LG1 – 3 . Recently , Pulido et al . ( 13 ) reported a high - resolution crystal structure of the integrin binding region of mouse LM111 . The global structure of LM111 is essentially the same as that of LM511 shown here , with both LM111 and LM511 exhibiting a triangular configuration of LG1 – 3 with the b 1 - g 1 dimer clamped between LG1 and LG2 . One interesting difference is that the LG3 in LM111 is positioned to makethetransverseplaneofLG1 – 3orthogonaltothecoiled - coildomain , whereas LG3 in LM511 forms a beveled plane of LG1 – 3 ( fig . S2A ) . Nevertheless , the g 1 - tail in the LM111 structure is oriented toward the bottom face of LG1 / LG2 with the side chain of E1605 ( equivalent to g 1E1607 in human ) and the following residues disordered in the crystal structure ( fig . S2B ) , as in our human tLM511E8 structure . LM511 binds to a 6 b 1 integrin in a bottom - to - head manner The ligand - binding site of integrins has been mapped to the upper face of the integrin ’ s headpiece that consists of the b - propeller do - main of the a subunit and the b I / hybrid domains of the b subunit ( 3 ) . It is generally accepted that recognition of physiological ligands by integrins relies on an acidic residue in the ligands , coordinating a divalent metal ion in the MIDAS of the integrin b subunit ( b - MIDAS ) ( 14 ) . Consistent with this scheme , the Glu residues in the g 1 - tail ( E1607 ) and g 2 - tail ( E1191 ) are essential for integrin binding by lami - nins ; the g 3 chain does not have an equivalent Glu residue ( 11 , 12 ) . Furthermore , our exhaustive survey demonstrated that no single acidic residue in the LM511E8 fragment other than g 1E1607 is critically re - quired for integrin binding ( 15 ) , pointing toward the possibility that g 1E1607 directly coordinates with the b - MIDAS . To gain insight into the location of the integrin binding site within LM511 , we examined LM511E8 complexed with recombinant a 6 b 1 integrin by electron mi - croscopy . A gallery of electron microscopic images revealed that the headpiece of a 6 b 1 integrin always bound to LM511E8 at the site op - posite the filament - like coiled - coil extension ( Fig . 3A and fig . S3 ) . These results indicate that LM511 binds to a 6 b 1 integrin via the bottom face of LG1 – 3 , where the disordered five C - terminal resi - dues of the g 1 - tail are predicted to reside ( Fig . 3B ) .

Adv . 2017 ; 3 : e1701497 1 September 2017 2 of 8 The g 1 - tail is positioned close to the metal ion of the b 1 - MIDAS To further clarify the possibility that the g 1 - tail directly interacts with a 6 b 1 integrin , we simultaneously introduced Cys substitutions into the g 1 - tail and the b I domain of integrin b 1 and then performed exhaustive screening for intermolecular disulfide formation between the Cys - substituted LM511E8 and the a 6 b 1 integrin . We reasoned that a Cys residue introduced adjacent to g 1E1607 would become cross - linked to a Cys residue introduced near the b 1 - MIDAS if the g 1 - tail directly interacts with integrin b 1 . Thus , we introduced Cys substi - tutions of residues I1606 and K1608 of the g 1 - tail ( Fig . 3C ) and of 19 residues in the b I domain that are predicted to be surface - exposed near the b 1 - MIDAS ( fig . S4 ) . LM511E8 with g 1 - I1606C and g 1 - K1608C substitutions ( designated LM511E8 / I1606C and LM511E8 / K1608C , respectively ) retained integrin binding activity , whereas those having additional Gln substitutions for g 1E1607 ( designated LM511E8 / I1606C / EQ and LM511E8 / K1608C / EQ ) were almost devoid of the ac - tivity ( fig . S5 ) . Coexpression of Cys - substituted LM511E8 and a 6 b 1 integrin in mammalian cells and subsequent immunoprecipitation of secreted LM511E8 , followed by SDS – polyacrylamide gel electrophore - sis ( SDS - PAGE ) under nonreducing conditions , identified a total of seven disulfide - linked products between LM511E8 and a 6 b 1 integrin , depending on the position of the Cys substitution near the b 1 - MIDAS ( Fig . 3 , D and E , and fig . S6 ) . LM511E8 / I1606C was disulfide - linked to four Cys - substituted integrin b 1 residues : 133 , 221 , 222 , and 223 ( Fig . 3E , top ) ; LM511E8 / K1608C was disulfide - linked to three Cys - substituted residues : 133 , 223 , and 225 ( Fig . 3E , bottom ) . The ability of both laminin mutants to form disulfide bonds with integrin b 1 resi - dues 133 and 223 is consistent with the fact that these residues are closest to the MIDAS metal ion , where g 1E1607 is predicted to ligate ( Fig . 3D ) . In contrast , residues 221 and 222 , which are located further away from the a subunit , preferentially cross - linked to LM511E8 / I1606C , whereas residue225 , situated closer to the a subunit , efficiently cross - linked to LM511E8 / K1608C . These results suggest that the I1606 - E1607 - K1608 segment of the g 1 - tail is aligned parallel to theseg - ment with residues221 to 225 of the a 2 - a 3 loop ofintegrin b 1 , withthe C - terminal end of the former pointing toward the b - propeller domain ofintegrin a 6 when g 1E1607 coordinateswiththe b 1 - MIDAS metalion ( Fig . 3F , top ) . This is in sharp contrast to the common mode of Arg - Gly - Asp ( RGD ) motif recognition by many integrins , where a short peptide segment is docked at the a - b interface in the N → C direction , with the side chains of Arg and Asp being recognized by the a and b subunits of integrins , respectively ( Fig . 3F , bottom ) ( 16 – 18 ) . To confirm the specificity of the intermolecular disulfide formation between the Cys - substituted LM511E8 and the a 6 b 1 integrin , we per - formed the disulfide cross - link assays using laminin mutants carrying the inactivating Gln mutation at g 1E1607 ( fig . S7 ) . The Gln substitution resulted in a significant reduction in the disulfide formation , suggesting that efficient disulfide bond formation requires correct steering of the g 1 - tail guided by the g 1E1607 - MIDAS interaction . It is also notable that intermolecular disulfide bonds , particularly involving integrin b 1 residue 133 , form to some extent in the absence of g 1E1607 , suggest - ing that LM511E8 devoid of g 1E1607 has weak but appreciable binding ability to integrin . g 1 - Tail – derived peptide inhibits laminin - integrin interaction Although these results strongly support the idea that the g 1 - tail com - prises the integrin binding site of LM511 and directly interacts with the b 1 - MIDAS of a 6 b 1 integrin , we have been unable to show competitive inhibition of integrin - ligand interaction using synthetic peptides derived from the g 1 - tail ( 11 ) , which has been repeatedly observed in RGD - recognizing integrins with RGD and related peptides ( 19 ) . To re - visit the effect of synthetic g 1 - tail peptides on laminin - integrin inter - actions , we performed inhibition assays using a g 1 - tail – derived pentapeptide SIEKP ( designated g 1C5 ) and its E - to - Q mutant ( SIQKP ) under conditions where a 6 b 1 integrin was rendered conformationally Fig . 2 .

Adv . 2017 ; 3 : e1701497 1 September 2017 3 of 8 activebytheactivatinganti - integrin b 1 antibodyTS2 / 16 . g 1C5 wasonly weakly inhibitory to a 6 b 1 integrin binding to LM511E8 in the absence of TS2 / 16 , but it exerted a significant inhibitory activity in the presence of TS2 / 16 [ half - maximal inhibitory concentration ( IC 50 ) approximately 25 m M ] ( Fig . 4A ) . The inhibitory activity of g 1C5 was abrogated by the E - to - Q substitution , lending support to the idea of direct interaction of the g 1 - tail with a 6 b 1 integrin in a g 1E1607 - dependent manner . DISCUSSION Despite the requirement for the Glu residue within the g - tail in integrin recognition by laminins , it has remained unsettled whether the g - tail is required for the maintenance of a functionally active conformation of LG1 – 3 of the a chain or whether it directly interacts with integrin by coordinating the metal ion in the b - MIDAS . Several lines of evidence obtained in this study support the latter possibility . First , the g 1 - tail of tLM511E8 was found disordered in the crystallized structure and there - fore does not seem to contribute significantly to the maintenance of LG1 – 3 conformation . The C - terminal region of the b 1 - g 1 dimer is clamped between LG1 and LG2 , suggesting that the disordered g 1 - tail extends to the bottom face of the ladle - shaped tLM511E8 . Second , elec - tron microscopic imaging of LM511E8 complexed with a 6 b 1 integrin revealed that LM511E8 binds to the integrin in a bottom - to - head manner , consistent with the prediction that the disordered g 1 - tail - MIDAS Glu - Tail RGD - containing ligand 100 250 250 100 A LM511E8 6 1 integrin 10 nm Laminin - integrin binding interface B E D C I221 1 - MIDAS Y133 S222 G223 L225 S132 S134 1 2 - 3 loop E229 1 ( kDa ) 6 1 integrin LM 5E8 LM 5E8 [ IP ] [ IB ] 6 1 integrin / LM511E8 / WT WT K1608C ( kDa ) 6 1 integrin LM 5E8 LM 5E8 [ IP ] [ IB ] 6 1 integrin / LM511E8 / WT WT I1606C 2 - 3 loop K1608C 1 - 1 loop I1606C Wild type F N - Tail Glu Laminin C Asp N Arg Acidic residue RGD loop - MIDAS - MIDAS - Tail Bottom face Headpiece Laminin Integrin contact Laminin - integrin binding interface propeller domain C “Bottom - to - head” Fig . 3 .

Third , intermolecular disulfide cross - link screening with a panel of Cys - substituted LM511E8s and a 6 b 1 integrins demonstrated that the g 1 - tail is selectively disulfide - linked to residues near the b 1 - MIDAS , supporting the idea of direct interaction ofthe g 1 - tailwithintegrin ’ s b 1 - MIDAS . Finally , the g 1C5peptideSIEKP inhibited the binding of LM511E8 to a 6 b 1 integrin , but its E - to - Q mu - tantdidnot , corroboratingthedirectinteractionofthe g 1 - tailwith a 6 b 1 integrin , in which g 1E1607 is prerequisite . Together , these findings lead ustoconcludethatthe g 1 - taildirectlyinteractswithintegrin ’ s b 1 - MIDAS , with g 1E1607 serving as the critical acidic residue that coordinates the metal ion in the b 1 - MIDAS . There is compelling evidence that LG1 – 3 is required for laminin recognition by integrins . Deletion of LG1 – 3 or substitution of any one of the LGs nullifies the integrin binding activity of laminins ( 10 , 20 ) . Furthermore , the integrin binding specificity , as well as the affinity of lamininisoforms , hasbeenshowntobeprimarilydefinedbythelaminin a chains ( 4 ) . In support of the involvement of LG1 – 3 in laminin recog - nition by integrins , the LM511E8 mutant lacking the five C - terminal residuesofthe g 1 - tailcompetitivelyinhibitedthebindingof a 6 b 1integrin to LM511E8 , albeit at a much higher concentration than intact E8 ( fig . S8 ) . Given that LM511E8 binds to a 6 b 1 integrin in a bottom - to - head manner , it is conceivable that LG1 – 3 harbor an auxiliary integrin recognition site ( s ) at their bottom face that can complement the primary site involving the g 1 - tail , although the detailed location of this site ( s ) remains to be explored . Pulido et al . ( 13 ) noted that the LG1 and LG2surfacesoneithersideofthe g 1 - tailaremorehighlyconservedthan that of LG3 , implying that the residues involved in integrin binding lie within the highly conserved surfaces . Our exhaustive disulfide cross - link screening with Cys - substituted LM511E8 and a 6 b 1 integrin showed that the g 1 - tail came into close contact with and cross - linked with integrin b 1 residue 133 near the b 1 - MIDAS even in the absence of g 1E1607 . These findings suggest that the interaction of a 6 b 1 integrin with the bottom face of LG1 – 3 brings the g 1 - tail into close contact with the b 1 - MIDAS , therebystabilizingthelaminin - integrincomplex ( Fig . 4B ) . In conclusion , we report evidence that supports a scheme in which the g 1 - tail directly interacts with integrin b 1 , with g 1E1607 coordinat - ing the metal ion in the b 1 - MIDAS during formation of the LM511 – a 6 b 1integrincomplex .

The PCR products were digested with Nhe I and Not I and then ligated into the Nhe I – Not I sites , that is , between the Nhe site and the Not I site , of pcDNA3 . 4 + MCS . 6×His , HA , and FLAG tags , followed by a TEV protease recognition sequence , were added by extension PCR . The PCR products were digested with Nhe I / Not I and inserted into the corresponding restriction sites of pcDNA3 . 4 + MCS . tLM a 5E8 / I2723C and tLM g 1E8 / D1585C mutants were generated by extension PCR using tLM a 5E8 and tLM g 1E8 ex - pression vectors as templates , respectively . The PCR products were digested with Nhe I / Not I and inserted into the corresponding restric - tion sites of pcDNA3 . 4 + MCS . An expression vector for the extracellular domain of human integrin a 6 with C - terminal ACID peptide and FLAG tag sequences was prepared as described previously ( 10 ) . An expression vector for the ex - tracellular domain of human integrin b 1 with a BASE peptide and a 6×His tag sequence at the C terminus was prepared as described previ - ously ( 21 ) . Expression vectors for integrin b 1 mutants , in which 19 res - idues located on the I - like domain were individually Cys - substituted , were produced by extension PCR , using integrin b 1 expression vector as the template . The PCR products were digested with Bam HI / Not I and cloned into the same sites of the wild - type construct . All DNA sequences were verified using ABI PRISM 3130xl Genetic Analyzer ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . Expression and purification of recombinant proteins LM511E8 was transiently expressed in FreeStyle 293 - F cells ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions . Conditioned media were collected 72 hours after transfection and loaded onto cOmplete His - Tag Purification Resin ( Roche ) . The resin was washed with Hepes - buffered saline ( HBS ) ( 8 . 0 ) [ 20 mM Hepes and 137 mM NaCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) ] , and the protein was eluted with HBS ( 8 . 0 ) containing 250 mM imidazole . Fractions containing LM511E8 were further loaded onto DDDDK - tagged Protein Purification Gel ( MBL ) . The resin was washed with HBS ( 7 . 4 ) [ 20 mM Hepes and 137 mM NaCl ( pH 7 . 4 ) ] , and the proteins were eluted with HBS ( 7 . 4 ) containing DDDDK peptide ( 100 m g / ml ; MBL ) . Fractions containing LM511E8 were concentrated with Amicon Ultra - 15 ( Merck Millipore ) and further purified on a Superdex 200 10 / 300 GL column ( GE Healthcare ) using HBS ( 7 . 4 ) as the running buffer . tLM511E8 for crystallization was produced using FreeStyle 293 - F cells and purified by affinity chromatography as for LM511E8 . Fractions containing tLM511E8 were concentrated using Amicon Ultra - 15 and digested with TEV protease ( 2000 U / ml ) at 25°C for 24 hours . The reaction mixture was subjected to gel filtration on a Superdex 200 10 / 300 GL column using HBS ( 7 . 4 ) as the running buffer . Fractions containing TEV - digested tLM511E8 were concen - trated with Amicon Ultra - 2 ( Merck Millipore ) to ~ 30 mg / ml and stored at − 80°C . Recombinant human a 6 b 1 integrin was prepared as described pre - viously ( 10 , 11 ) . Intact a 6 b 1 integrin for electron microscopic observa - tion was prepared using the same expression system . The conditioned media wereloadedonto ANTI - FLAGM2 AffinityGel ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , and bound proteins were eluted with HBS ( 7 . 4 ) containing FLAG pep - tide ( 100 m g / ml ) . Fractions containing a 6 b 1 integrinwereconcentrated with Amicon Ultra - 4 ( Merck Millipore ) and immediately subjected to gel filtration on a Superdex 200 10 / 300 GL column using HBS ( 7 . 4 ) as the running buffer . Fractions containing a 6 b 1 integrin were collected andstoredat − 80°C . Proteinconcentrationsofallrecombinantproducts were determined using Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) using bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) as the standard . Solid - phase integrin binding assay Binding activities of a 6 b 1 integrin to wild - type and mutant LM511E8s , including tLM511E8 , were measured by solid - phase binding assays as follows . LM511E8swereadsorbedonto96 - wellmicrotiterplates ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) at 10 nM overnight at 4°C and then blocked with 3 % BSA at room temperature for 1 hour . The amounts of LM511E8s adsorbed on the plates were quantified with mAbs 5D6 and 4C7 to confirm the equality of the amounts of adsorbed proteins . After washing once with tris - buffered saline ( TBS ) [ 20 mM tris and 137 mM NaCl ( pH 7 . 4 ) ] containing 1 mM MnCl 2 , 0 . 3 % BSA , and 0 . 02 % Tween 20 ( Mn 2 + buffer ) , the plates were incubated with serially diluted a 6 b 1 integrin solution at room temperature for 3 hours in the presence of 1 mM MnCl 2 or 10 mM EDTA . After three washes with Mn 2 + buffer or TBS containing 10 mM EDTA , 0 . 3 % BSA , and 0 . 02 % Tween 20 , the plateswereincubatedwithbiotinylatedrabbitanti - VelcropAb ( 1 . 5 m g / ml ) in Mn 2 + buffer at room temperature for 30 min . After three washes with Mn 2 + buffer , theplateswereincubatedwithstreptavidin - HRP ( 0 . 53 m g / ml ) for 15 min .

Adv . 2017 ; 3 : e1701497 1 September 2017 6 of 8 a 6 b 1 integrin was quantified by measuring the absorbance at 490 nm after incubation with o - phenylenediamine . The apparent dissociation constants were determined as described previously ( 25 ) . Preparation of laminin - integrin complex The laminin - integrin complex was formed by mixing 200 pmol of puri - fied LM511E8 and the same amount of purified a 6 b 1 integrin at room temperature for 30 min in HBS ( 7 . 4 ) containing 1 mM MnCl 2 . The complex was subjected to gel filtration on a Superose 6 10 / 300 GL col - umn ( GE Healthcare ) preequilibrated with HBS containing 1 mM MnCl 2 . Fractions containing the complex were identified by SDS - PAGE followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining . Electron microscopy and image processing The fractionated complex was incubated for 1 min at room tem - perature on glow - discharged carbon - coated grids ( Nisshin EM ) . Samples were washed three times in ultrapure water containing 1 mM MnCl 2 and stained three times with 2 % uranyl acetate for 30 s . After vacuum drying , grids were inspected with a Hitachi H - 7650 transmission electron microscope operated at 80 kV . Intermolecular disulfide bond formation between LM511E8 and a 6 b 1 integrin c - Myc – tagged LM a 5E8 was used throughout the intermolecular disulfide formation assays . LM511E8 / wild type , LM511E8 / I1606C , LM511E8 / I1606C / EQ , LM511E8 / K1608C , and LM511E8 / K1608C / EQ were transiently coexpressed with wild - type or Cys - introduced a 6 b 1 integrin using the FreeStyle 293 Expression System . Seventy - two hours after transfection , conditioned media were incubated with mAb 5D6 ( 1 m g / ml ) at 4°C for 1 hour . Secreted laminin - integrin complexes were precipitated with Protein G Sepharose 4 Fast Flow ( GE Healthcare ) . Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS - PAGE under nonreducing conditions , followed by immunoblotting with anti – c - Myc mAb and anti - Velcro pAb . Inhibition of a 6 b 1 integrin binding to LM511E8 Wild - typeLM511E8wasadsorbedonto96 - wellmicrotiterplatesat10nM overnight at 4°C and then blocked with 3 % BSA at room temperature for 1 hour . Serially diluted synthetic peptide [ g 1C5 or g 1C5 ( EQ ) ] or LM511E8 ( wild type or Dg 1C5 ) was incubated with 1 nM a 6 b 1 integrin in Mn 2 + buffer containing 3 nM isotype control IgG orintegrin b 1 ac - tivating mAb TS2 / 16 at room temperature for 1 hour , then added to LM511E8 - coated plates , and allowed to bind to LM511E8 at room temperature for 1 hour . After three washes with Mn 2 + buffer , the plates were incubated with biotinylated rabbit anti - Velcro pAb ( 1 . 5 m g / ml ) in Mn 2 + buffer at room temperature for 30 min . After three washes with Mn 2 + buffer , the plates were incubated with streptavidin - HRP ( 0 . 53 m g / ml ) for 15 min . After three washes with Mn 2 + buffer , the amount of bound a 6 b 1 integrin was quantified by measuring the absorbance at 490 nm after incubation with o - phenylenediamine . IC 50 values were calculated using the following equation y ¼ A (cid:2) D 1 þ ð x = C Þ B þ D where x is peptide or LM511E8 concentration ( in micromolars per nanomolar ) , “ y ” is activity ( in percent ) in the presence of inhibitors relative to the activity in the absence of inhibitors , “ A ” corresponds to the relative activity on the top plateau region of the curve , “ B ” cor - responds to the slope , “ C ” corresponds to the inflection point of the curve , and “ D ” correspondstotherelativeactivityonthebottomplateau region of the curve . To obtain these four parameters , experimental raw data points were fitted to this equation using the “ Curve Fitter ” tool of ImageJ software ( 26 ) . IC 50 values were determined by substituting “ y = 50 ” in the abovementioned equation . Crystallization and diffraction data collection Crystallization was performed at 20°C . Initial screening of crystal - lization conditions was performed using The Classics Neo Suite ( Qiagen ) . For this screen , a mosquito crystallization robot ( TTP LabTech ) was used to dispense 0 . 5 m l of protein solution mixed in a 1 : 1 ratio with the reservoir solution . Drops were equilibrated over 80 m l of reservoir solution using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method . The initial crystallization condition [ 0 . 2 M ammonium sulfate , 0 . 1 M sodium acetate ( pH 4 . 6 ) , and 25 % polyethylene glycol 4000 at room temperature ] was optimized using a 24 - well crystallization plate with the hanging drop vapor diffusion method . Each well contained 500 m l of reservoir solution , and the drop volume was a mixture of 0 . 5 m l of protein solution and 0 . 5 m l of reservoir solution . Diffraction quality crystals were obtained under conditions of 0 . 2 M ammonium sulfate , 0 . 1 M sodium acetate adjusted to pH 4 . 2 with acetic acid , and 19 % poly - ethylene glycol 4000 . Before x - ray diffraction experiments , crystals were soaked in reservoir solution containing an additional 20 % glycerol and flash - cooled in liquid nitrogen . The diffraction data set for phasing was collected at BL - 1A , Photon Factory ( Tsukuba , Japan ) , and processed using the XDS package ( 27 ) . In this data collection , three data sets of 720° each with an oscillation angle of 0 . 2° were merged . A higher - resolution data set for refinement wascollectedatBL44XU , SPring - 8 ( Hyogo , Japan ) , andprocessed using the HKL2000 package ( 28 ) . The diffraction data statistics are shown in table S1 . Structure determination The crystal structure of tLM511E8 was solved by the single - wavelength anomalous dispersion method using native crystals . The coordinates of the substructure including the sulfur atoms and the calcium ion were determined using SHELXC and SHELXD ( 29 ) . The phase calculation using these coordinates with phase im - provement followed by automated initial model building was per - formed using the PHENIX program package ( 30 ) . This initial model was then extended and refined by manual editing using COOT ( 31 ) , with the iterated implementation of refmac5 ( 32 ) on the higher - resolution data set . Finally , the crystal structure was re - fined to the R / R free factors of 0 . 202 / 0 . 237 at a resolution of 1 . 80 Å , validated with MOLPROBIDY ( 33 ) . Refinement statistics are de - scribed in table S1 . All figures of the tLM511E8 model in this article were produced using PyMOL ( www . pymol . org / ) .
