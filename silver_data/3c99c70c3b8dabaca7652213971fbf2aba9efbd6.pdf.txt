The g - phosphate - exchangingactivityofNDPKwasmeasuredasdescribed 26 with minor modiﬁcations . The assay buffer contained 100mM Tris - Cl , pH 7 . 5 , 100mM KCl , 25mM MgCl 2 , 3mM phosphoenolpyruvate , 2mM ATP , 0 . 3mM NADH , 2 . 5 units pyruvatekinase , 2 . 5unitslactatedehydrogenaseand1mMdCDP . Thereactionwasstarted by adding puriﬁed NDPK to a ﬁnal concentration of 3nM in 600 m l at 20 8 C . NDPK activity was measured by monitoring the lactate dehydrogenase - pyruvate kinase - coupled NADH decrease ( change in absorption at 340nm ) in the reaction mixture . The effect of phytochrome on NDPK activity was examined by incubating puriﬁed oat phytochromes , illuminatedbyred ( 660nm , P fr form ) orfar - red ( 730nm , P r form ) light , withNDPKinthe reaction mixture . The K m value of NDPK2 with dCDP was measured in a similar manner except that the ﬁnal concentration of phytochromes was ﬁxed at 60nM . Invitrobinding assay Six - histidine - tagged NDPK2 ( 500ng ) was crosslinked with the P r or P fr form of oat phytochrome ( 1 m g ) by adding the thiol - reactive crosslinking reagent bisbromobimane ( bBBr ) toaﬁnalconcentrationof1mMin20 m lreactionbuffer ( 100mMHEPES , pH8 . 0 , 50mM NaCl , 10mM MgCl 2 ) 27 . After 1min of crosslinking , the reaction was stopped by adding glutathione to a ﬁnal concentration 100mM . The crosslinked samples were separated on SDS – PAGE and detected using a histidine - tag antibody . Localization of NDPK2 A NDPK2 gene was fused to GFP and subcloned into pBI121 plant binary vector ( Clontech ) . Transgenic tobacco plants were then generated by Agrobacterium - mediated transformation and the localization of GFP - fused NDPK2 was observed bya ﬂuorescence microscope ( Olympus ) . Characterization of a ndpk2mutant A ndpk2 mutantwasisolatedfromFeldmannT - DNAinsertionlines 28 andaninsertionsite identiﬁed by sequencing . The homozygous line of the ndpk2 mutant was used for the characterization . Toinvestigatethefar - redhigh - irradianceresponse , bothwild - type ( WS - 2 ) and ndpk2 mutants were grown on MS agar plates without sucrose under continuous far - red light ( 8 m Wcm - 2 ) for 5 days .

Actin polymerization is essential for cell locomotion and is thought to generate the force responsible for cellular protrusions . The Arp2 / 3 complex is required to stimulate actin assembly at the leading edge in response to signalling 1 – 6 . The bacteria Listeria and Shigella bypass the signalling pathway and harness the Arp2 / 3 complex to induce actin assembly and to propel themselves in living cells 7 – 10 . However , the Arp2 / 3 complex alone is insufﬁcient to promote movement . Here we have used pure components of the actin cytoskeleton to reconstitute sustained movement in Listeria and Shigella in vitro . Actin - based propulsion is driven by the free energy released by ATP hydrolysis linked to actin polymerization , and does not require myosin . In addition to actin and activated Arp2 / 3 complex , actin depolymerizing factor ( ADF , or coﬁlin ) and capping protein are also required for motility as they maintain a high steady - state level of G - actin , which controls the rate of unidirectional growth of actin ﬁlaments at the surface of the bacterium . The movement is more effective when proﬁlin , a - actinin and VASP ( for Listeria ) are also included . These results have implications for our understanding of the mechanism of actin - based motility in cells . Attempts to understand how site - directed actin polymerization can produce movement in cells have centred on work to connect actin to the signalling pathway in Listeria and Shigella . The Arp2 / 3 complex is activated by all proteins of the WASP / Scar family 1 – 5 , which connect the cytoskeleton to the signalling pathway 3 , 11 . The Shigella IcsA protein recruits N - WASP 12 and activates it in a Cdc42 - like fashion , leading to Arp2 / 3 activation 10 . The Listeria ActA protein activates Arp2 / 3 by mimicking N - WASP 9 . N - WASP can mediate the insertional polymerization of actin because its amino - terminal domain binds F - actin and its carboxy - terminal domain © 1999 Macmillan Magazines Ltd letters to nature 614 NATURE | VOL 401 | 7 OCTOBER 1999 | www . nature . com binds G - actin in a proﬁlin - like fashion , shuttling actin subunits to the growing barbed ends 10 . The combination of ActA and VASP at the surface of Listeria may fulﬁl a function equivalent to that of IcsA - activated N - WASP 13 . However , when bacteria are brought into a solution of pure F - actin , assembled at steady state in the presence of ATP , Arp2 / 3 and either VASP or N - WASP , the bacteria initiate actin assembly at their surface but fail to move 8 , 10 , 13 , whereas they can move steadily in cell - free extracts with an ATP supply . We sought to reconstitute actin - based movement by supplementing the bacterium - activated machinery with proteins that would shuttle actin subunits to the barbed ends generated by locally activated Arp2 / 3 complex . We observed sustained movement of Listeria and N - WASP - coated Escherichia coli ( IcsA ) ( Fig . 1 ) in a physiological ionic strength buffer solution , pH 7 . 5 , containing F - actin ( 7 . 5 m M ) supplemented with 0 . 1 m M Arp2 / 3 , 0 . 05 m M capping protein , 5 m M ADF , 2 . 5 m M proﬁlin and 0 . 25 m M a - actinin , and the Listeria motility medium also contained 0 . 5 m M VASP ; these con - centrations are generally compatible with those found in vivo . The bacteria formed actin tails about 30 m m long and moved at rates of up to 2 m m min - 1 ( E . coli ( IcsA ) ) or 4 m m min - 1 ( Listeria ) , similar to values recorded in extracts , and the percentage of motile bacteria was also the same as in extracts 13 . This motility medium was developed because actin - based move - ment results from the rapid turnover of actin ﬁlaments , which grow from their barbed ends at speciﬁc sites and depolymerize from the pointed ends of all ﬁlaments in the medium in a treadmilling process 14 . Efﬁcient propulsion ﬁrst implies that the treadmilling is strongly biased , or ‘funnelled’ 15 , such that barbed ends grow only where force is needed . Complete barbed - end capping of all ﬁla - ments in the medium fulﬁls this condition and maintains G - actin subunits at the high concentration required ( the critical concentra - tion ) at the pointed end . Furthermore , barbed ends generated at the bacterial surface must be capped as soon as they dissociate from the motile ActA – VASP or IcsA – N - WASP machinery . In addition , the treadmilling rate is governed by the rate of depolymerization from ﬁlament pointed ends . This reaction is very slow in pure F - actin solutions , which is why bacteria fail to move in standard F - actin solution . Actin depolymerizing factor and proﬁlin are there - fore expected to contribute to actin - based propulsion 16 – 19 , as they act synergistically , leading to a 125 - fold increase in ﬁlament turn - over and to a large increase in the steady - state amount of ATP – G - actin and proﬁlin – actin . The F - actin solution containing capping protein , ADF and proﬁlin therefore acts as a chemostat to elicit the rapid shuttling of ATP – G - actin subunits , supporting actin - based propulsion of Listeria as well as Shigella . The high steady - state concentration of ATP – G - actin represents the ‘fuel’ for different bacteria - associated motors . The F - actin present in the medium buffers the ATP – G - actin at its steady - state concentration , so it may be present at any concentration . Bacterial movement also requires a - actinin 20 , and the role of VASP in Listeria movement has been studied 13 , 21 , 22 . Thenon - pathogenic E . coli expressing IcsAwas used as a valid substitute for Shigella , as it can move in Xenopus egg extracts 23 , 24 and in N - WASP - supplemented platelet extracts 10 . We established the optimum composition of the dynamic steady - state F - actin solution suitable for Listeria or E . coli ( IcsA ) movement and determined which proteins are essential for motility by measur - ing the rates of bacterial propulsion when a range of concentrations of Arp2 / 3 , capping protein , ADF , proﬁlin , a - actinin ( and VASP for Listeria ) were added to an F - actin solution ( Table 1 ) .

In the presence of just Arp2 / 3 , ADF and capping protein , Listeria and N - WASP - coated E . coli ( IcsA ) moved slowly at rates of 0 . 5 and 1 . 2 m mmin - 1 , respectively . The rate of movement varied with all protein concentrations with a bell - shaped curve . Free Arp2 / 3 present in the motility medium is inactive 2 – 5 , 10 , being transiently activated at the bacterium surface by interaction with ActA 9 or IcsA - bound N - WASP 10 to nucleate / branch actin ﬁlaments in a spatially restricted fashion 6 , 9 and then incorporated at branches in the actin meshwork 10 . The dependence of the rate on ADF reached a maximum at half - saturation of F - actin by ADF , like the treadmilling rate in vitro 17 and consistent with biochemical data showing that ADF increases the turnover of actin ﬁlaments even when Arp2 / 3 is present 19 . The requirement of barbed - end capping for movement points to a function for capping proteins that explains 16 their reported effect in cell motility 25 – 27 . At very high concentrations , however , capping protein blocks the elongation of actin ﬁlaments formed at the bacterium surface , overcoming the barbed - end nucleation process elicited by Arp2 / 3 , so movement is slower . Listeria and E . coli ( IcsA ) depended equally on ADF , proﬁlin and capping protein for move - ment , although Listeria moved twice as fast as E . coli ( IcsA ) under all conditions , owing to their different motile machineries at the surface ( ActA – VASP and IcsA – N - WASP , respectively ) . Proﬁlin ( and VASP for Listeria ) , although not absolutely essential , were nonetheless important for movement . Proﬁlin increases the rate of movement two - to threefold , consistent with previous motility assays 13 , 28 and with biochemical data showing that proﬁlin enhances the processivity of treadmilling in the presence of ADF 18 . The absence of VASP was more deleterious than that of proﬁlin in Listeria movement , causing a tenfold decrease in the rate of move - ment , even though normal actin tails were still formed . This result is in agreement with a recent report showing that VASP is present at the leading edge in amounts correlating with the rate of protrusion 29 , but is only in partial agreement with genetic and depletion studies 13 , 21 , 22 showing that abnormal actin tails form and movement ceases for most bacteria in the absence of VASP . In cells and cell extracts , other proteins might interact with ActA at the VASP - binding site , either compensating for or aggravating the effects of VASP removal . Our reconstituted motility medium there - fore represents a better tool for testing the speciﬁc functions of different proteins in motility . We found that a - actinin was not required for movement , and varying its concentration had no effect on the rate of movement . However , when a - actinin was not present , the actin tails were much less denseand the bacteria attached to their tails drifted appreciably in the solution , presumably owing to the lack of connections between the ﬁlaments in the medium and those that form the actin tails . Vinculin was not required for E . coli ( IcsA ) movement , in agreement with a previous report 30 . In conclusion , actin - based movement can be reconstituted in vitro by using a small number of actin - binding proteins whose function in the regulation of actin dynamics is well established . No myosin motor is required for actin - based movement . Actin - based movement operates by using the free energy released by ATP hydrolysis to actin assembly . Knowing which proteins are essential for actin - based movement is an important step toward under - standing its detailed mechanism and its regulation by the signalling pathway .

It has been suggested that 14 - 3 - 3 s promotes pre - mitotic cell - cycle arrest following DNA damage , and that its expression can be controlled by the p53 tumour suppressor gene 1 . Here we describe an improved approach to the generation of human somatic - cell knockouts , which we have used to generate human colorectal cancer cells in which both 14 - 3 - 3 j alleles are inactivated . After DNA damage , these cells initially arrested in the G2 phase of the cell cycle , but , unlike cells containing 14 - 3 - 3 s , the 14 - 3 - 3 s - / - cells were unable to maintain cell - cycle arrest . The 14 - 3 - 3 s - / - cells died ( ‘mitotic catastrophe’ ) as they entered mitosis . This process was associated with a failure of the 14 - 3 - 3 s - deﬁcient cells to sequester the proteins ( cyclin B1 and cdc2 ) that initiate mitosis and prevent them from entering the nucleus . These results may indicate a mechanism for maintaining the G2 checkpoint and preventing mitotic death . Many cell types treated with DNA - damaging agents arrest in the G2 phase of the cell cycle . The 14 - 3 - 3 j gene is transcriptionally activated by p53 after DNA damage , and exogenous overexpression of 14 - 3 - 3 s can block cells in G2 , indicating that 14 - 3 - 3 s might be a component of the G2 checkpoint 1 . To test this hypothesis , we created cell lines deﬁcient in 14 - 3 - 3 s by homologous recombina - tion . The human 14 - 3 - 3 j genomic locus was cloned and fully sequenced , and subclones were used to construct a targeting vector containing a geneticin - resistance gene in place of genomic 14 - 3 - 3 j sequences . Two loxP sites were introduced into the con - struct , one immediately 5 9 and the other directly 3 9 to the geneticin - resistance gene . A primer site for polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) derived from deleted genomic sequences was placed between the 5 9 loxP site and the 5 9 end of the selection marker 2 . The two loxP sites and the primer - containing construct enabled a relatively rapid and robust approach to screening clones for correctly targeted alleles , and for sequentially generating clones with both alleles disrupted ( see Methods ) . The human colorectal cancer cell ( CRC ) line HCT116 was used for these experiments because it expresses wild - type p53 and 14 - 3 - 3 s , has intact DNA - damage checkpoints and is suitable for targeted homologous recombination 3 . Two independently derived 14 - 3 - 3 s + / - and three 14 - 3 - 3 s - / - clones were used for the studies described below ( Fig . 1a – c ) . All clones of the same genotype behaved identically . We investigated the function of 14 - 3 - 3 s in human cells following DNA damage by adriamycin , a commonly used chemotherapeutic agent , as well as by ionizing radiation . The disruption of 14 - 3 - 3 s had a marked effect on the responses of the cells to these agents . After either treatment , 14 - 3 - 3 s + / + and 14 - 3 - 3 s + / - cells increased in size , with a corresponding nuclear enlargement and DNA content characteristic of cells arrested in G2 ( Fig . 2a ) . Although 14 - 3 - 3 s - / - cells appeared to enter into a similar G2 block following DNA damage , they failed to maintain this arrest and eventually under - went ‘mitotic catastrophe’ ( Fig . 2a ) . Mitotic catastrophe is an apoptosis - like process than begins in prophase , after dissolution of the nuclear membrane , and is associated with the entry of cdc2 and cyclin B1 into the nucleus 4 , 5 . This process began , 24 h after
