Using Vicsek - style models with an Ornstein - Uhlenbeck process acting on angular velocity , we uncover a rich variety of collective phases not observed in usual overdamped systems , including vortex lattices and active foams . In a model with strictly nematic interactions the smectic arrangement of Vicsek waves giving rise to global polar order is observed . We also provide a calculation of the eﬀective interaction between vortices in the case where a telegraphic noise process is at play , explaining thus the emergence and structure of the vortex lattices observed here and in motility assay experiments .

Gh Self - propelled particles are nowadays commonly used to study collective motion and more generally “dry” ac - tive matter , where the surrounding ﬂuid is neglected . Real world relevant situations include shaken granular particles [ 1 – 5 ] , active colloids [ 6 – 8 ] , bio - ﬁlaments dis - placed by motor proteins [ 9 – 11 ] . The trajectories of mov - ing living organisms ( from bacteria to large animals such as ﬁsh , birds and even human crowds ) are also routinely modeled by such particles , see e . g . [ 12 – 17 ] . Many of these ‘active particles’ travel at near - constant speed with their dynamics modeled as a persistent ran - dom walk with some stochastic component acting di - rectly on their orientation [ 18 ] . This noise , which rep - resents external and / or internal perturbations , produces jagged irregular trajectories . Most of the recent results on active matter have been obtained in this context of overdamped dynamics . In many situations , however , the overdamped approx - imation is not justiﬁed . In particular , trajectories can be essentially smooth , as for chemically propelled rods [ 19 , 20 ] , birds , some large ﬁsh that swim steadily [ 16 ] , or even bioﬁlaments in motility assays with a high density of molecular motors [ 10 ] . Whether underdamped dynamics can make a diﬀerence at the level of collective asymp - totic properties is largely unknown . Interesting related progress was recently reported for starling ﬂocks [ 21 ] . Underdamped “spin” variables are instrumental there for eﬃcient , fast transfer of information through the ﬂock , allowing swift turns in response to threats during which speed is modulated in a well coordinated manner . In the other examples cited above , speed remains nearly - constant and the persistently turning tracks of ﬁsh or microtubules reveal some ﬁnite , possibly large , memory of the curvature . In this context an Ornstein - Uhlenbeck ( OU ) process acting on the angular velocity was shown to be a quantitatively - valid representation [ 10 , 16 ] . The collective motion of self - propelled particles with such un - derdamped angular dynamics remains largely unknown . In this Letter , we explore minimal models of aligning self - propelled particles with memory similar to that used in [ 10 ] to study the emergence of large - scale vortices in motility assays . Considering both polar ( ferromagnetic ) and nematic alignment interactions between particles , we show that memory is a crucial ingredient for collective motion giving rise to a wealth of collective states hereto - fore not observed in the memory - less case . Among the most remarkable features of the rich phase diagram of these minimal models , we provide evidence that global polar order can arise from strictly nematic interactions , taking the form of trains of “Vicsek waves” , i . e . the ubiq - uitous nonlinear structures well - known from models and experimental situations described by the traditional Vic - sek model [ 22 , 23 ] . We not only consider OU , but also telegraphic noise ( TN ) processes which we show to be more easily amenable to analytic approaches . For these telegraphic noise models , we present a calculation yield - ing the eﬀective interaction between emerging vortices , and thus a simple explanation of why these structures form hexagonal or square lattices depending on the sym - metry of the alignment interaction . Let us ﬁrst introduce Vicsek - style models with mem - ory . Point particles with position ˙ x i move at unit speed along their heading θ i ( t ) , i . e . ˙ x i = e θ i , where e θ i is the unit vector along θ i . Headings evolve according to : d θ i d t = α N i X | x j − x i | < 1 sin [ m ( θ j − θ i ) ] + ω i ( t ) ( 1 ) where the sum is over the N i neighbors of i within unit distance , m = 1 ( resp . 2 ) codes for ferromagnetic ( resp . 2 ( b ) ( a ) 0 1 2 3 4 1 10 10 2 ρ 0 τ V D N VW NB AF PL 0 1 2 3 4 1 10 10 2 ρ 0 τ V D P VW ZZ VC FIG . 1 .

( b ) : polar model . nematic ) alignment , and ω is a zero - mean noise . For un - correlated white noise , noise strength and global density of particles are the two main parameters , and these over - damped models are expected to exhibit a phase diagram similar to that of their discrete - time counterparts [ 24 – 26 ] . Memory is introduced via an Ornstein - Uhlenbeck pro - cess for the noise ω in Eq . ( 1 ) , keeping all other com - partments of the dynamics overdamped : d ω i d t = − 1 τ ω i + ξ i ( t ) ( 2 ) where ξ is a Gaussian white noise of variance σ 2 . The underdamped models deﬁned by Eqs . ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) depend on one extra parameter , the memory time τ . In the limit of small τ , they reduce to their overdamped versions . In [ 10 ] , the nematic version ( m = 2 ) of this model was introduced and a preliminary study of its collec - tive regimes was presented in the ( ρ 0 , τ ) plane keeping h ω 2 i = 12 τσ 2 , the variance of ω , ﬁxed [ 27 ] . Here , we present a detailed phase diagram of our models in the ( ρ 0 , τ ) plane also keeping h ω 2 i ﬁxed , having checked that its global structure does not vary much with h ω 2 i . The quantiﬁers used to deﬁne and distinguish the collective states observed and the methodology followed to estab - lish the following phase diagrams are detailed in [ 28 ] . Nematic model ( m = 2 ) . Its phase diagram is sum - marized in Fig . 1a . The three main regions found in [ 10 ] are present : At small enough density , noise always dominates alignment leaving an homogeneous disordered phase ( D ) . At low enough τ , homogeneous nematic order emerges ( N ) , while at high enough τ one eventually ob - serves a hexagonal lattice of large vortices ( V ) made with local nematic order ( see Fig . 2a , and [ 10 ] ) . Our analysis also revealed the existence of a complex arrangement of other collective states in the area sep - arating these three main regions . Consistent with the overdamped case [ 26 ] , a coexistence phase made of a dense nematic band ( NB ) standing in a disordered gas is present between the D and N regions . But there is also a large domain inside which one can observe trains of dense , traveling bands such as those known to occur in overdamped models with ferromagnetic alignment like the original Vicsek model [ 24 , 29 ] . These smectic polar pattern ( ‘Vicsek waves’ , VW , hereafter , Fig . 2c ) are even the only asymptotic state in a subregion of their obser - vation domain . Thus global polar order arises whereas the interaction is purely nematic . [ 30 ] Note that such global order , made of nonlinear structures , is not in con - tradiction with the theoretical arguments at linear level [ 26 , 31 , 32 ] precluding the emergence of homogeneous polar order in systems with nematic interactions . The vortex lattice directly melts to the homogeneous disorder state when decreasing τ at low densities . For large - enough ρ 0 , on the other hand , it becomes a spatio - temporally disordered cellular structure —an ‘active foam’ ( AF ) ( Fig . 2b ) . This foam is still made of the same nematically - ordered streams as the vortex lattice , but they are unstable . Finally , at large enough densities , increasing τ , the ho - mogeneous nematic state becomes transversally unstable . Global nematic order is preserved , but local segregation leads to oppositely - going polar lanes of relatively large width ( laning region PL in Fig . 1a , snapshot in Fig . 2d ) . Laning has been reported in overdamped self - propelled hard rods with long - enough aspect ratio interacting ex - clusively via steric exclusion , and also for elongated ‘de - formable’ particles [ 33 , 34 ] . Observed here it with point - wise particles , we conclude that ﬁnite - size particles are not necessary . This striped pattern is dynamic : a space - time plot of local polar order across the lanes reveals two sets of lanes ( each with lanes in both orientations ) moving slowly along this transversal direction , yielding a standing wave pattern ( Fig . 3 ) . Whether laning is also dynamic in rods systems remains to be investigated . Polar model ( m = 1 ) . We now describe the phase di - agram in the case of ferromagnetic alignment ( Fig . 1b ) , which has the same general features as in the nematic case : Three main regions are present , homogeneous dis - order ( D ) , homogeneous polar order ( P ) , and vortex lat - tice ( V ) . This lattice is now a checkerboard arrangement of locally polar clockwise and counterclockwise vortices ( Fig . 2e ) . Again , for short - enough memory time τ , one recovers , between the D and P phases , the coexistence phase made of a smectic arrangement of Vicsek waves ( VW ) , familiar from the study of the overdamped case . The central region is less complicated than in the ne - matic case , but nevertheless comprises ( at least ) two new phases . For ρ 0 > 1 , the vortex lattice leaves place to chaotic phase where vortex cores move , coalesce , vanish , 3 o r de r ( a ) vortex lattice ( V ) ( b ) active foam ( AF ) ( c ) vicsek wave ( VW ) ( d ) polar lane ( PL ) ( e ) vortex lattice ( V ) ( f ) vortex chaos ( VC ) ( g ) zigzag ( ZZ ) ρ = 0 ρ M local nematic localpolar den s i t y CCW CW FIG . 2 .

Fi - nally , the homogeneous polar order region P is bordered , at large τ , by a regime characterized by moving domains inside which polar order is perpendicular to the main direction of motion , so that particles perform “zigzag” trajectories ( ZZ region in Fig . 1b , snapshot in Fig . 2g ) . Some general comments are in order . For both the nematic and polar models several states are observed to coexist in the central region of parameter space : They can be reached from diﬀerent initial conditions , and ob - served for at least the very long time T that we use here as a criterion for “stability” . Determining which one is dominant , though , is a diﬃcult task beyond the scope of this paper . However , as already noticed for Vicsek waves in the nematic case , there exists , for each phase , a re - gion where it is the only observed state . Thus all phases reported here are likely to exist asymptotically . Telegraphic noise models . Further progress may come from numerical work even more intensive than reported here . Another avenue to ascertain the robustness of our results would be to derive continuous theories for our models . Unfortunately , methods that were proven suc - cessful in the overdamped case are diﬃcult to apply here since they rely on decorrelation of particles between suc - cessive interactions . A way out of this conundrum is to replace the Ornstein - Uhlenbeck process ( 2 ) by some sym - metric Poisson telegraphic noise process ω = ǫω 0 in which ǫ = ± 1 with a switching probability equal to 1 / τ . Then , indeed , one can consider two subpopulations of particles , clockwise and counterclockwise , exchanging particles at rate 1 / τ via some memoryless Poissonian switching pro - cess , similar to that for ﬂipping self - propelled rods in [ 20 ] . We ﬁrst studied numerically the collective properties of the telegraphic noise ( TN ) models . Their phase diagrams are qualitatively similar to those presented in Fig . 1 for the OU models ( detailed results will be published else - where [ 35 ] ) . Almost all phases observed in the OU case are also present with TN . Possibly the only exception is the absence of the active foam regime , which is replaced by a chaotic regime that appears as a superposition of ne - matic bands and vortices . This points to the robustness of the results presented so far , an indication that Vicsek - style models with memory can probably all be described by some common continuous theory . Here , we postpone the construction of a full - ﬂedged hydrodynamic theory . Instead , we now show how the structure of the emerging vortex lattice observed at large τ and the shape of its region of existence in parameter space can be understood via the calculation of the eﬀec - tive interaction between vortices . In the vortex region , τ is large , which means that one particle typically stays on a circle trajectory for a while . We take advantage of this to describe the dynamics of the centers r i of these circular trajectories , changing x i , the particle position , to r i = x i + ǫ i ω − 1 0 ( − sin θ i , cos θ i ) . Diﬀerentiating both sides and using Eq . ( 1 ) we obtain ˙ r i = 2 ǫ i δ ( t − t s ) ω 0 ˜ e θ i − αǫ i N i ω 0 X | x i − x j | < 1 sin [ m ( θ j − θ i ) ] e θ i ( 3 ) where ˜ e θ i = e θ i − π 2 , t s is the time when ǫ i switches be - tween ± 1 . Assuming that N i = 1 , θ changes little during one collision , we describe the ensemble behavior of Eqs . ( 3 ) by probability distributions of clock / anticlock - wise particles f ± ( r , θ ) satisfying the equations ( see [ 20 ] ) ∂f ± ( r , θ ) ∂t = ± ∂ ∂ r · e θ f ± ( r , θ ) U ± ω 0 − ∂ ∂θf ± ( r , θ ) ( ± ω 0 + U ± ) + f ∓ ( r ± D ˜ e θ , θ ) − f ± ( r , θ ) τ ( 4 ) with the ensemble - averaged rotation rates U ± = α X µ = − 1 , 1 Z d ξ Z π − π d φχ ( x µξ , φ , x ± 1 r , θ ) f µ ( ξ , φ ) sin ( φ − θ ) 4 t x 1024 0 2000 0 polar order FIG . 3 .

To simplify Eqs . ( 4 ) , we average over the rotation period and assume the dis - tributions to be almost uniform in θ ( an assumption valid below the onset of ordered phase [ 36 ] ) . Deﬁning F ± ( ) = R 2 π 0 f ± ( r , θ ) d θ / 2 π we obtain ∂F ± ∂t = − Dα ∂ ∂ r · F ± ( r ) Z d ξ K ( r − ξ ) [ F ± ( ξ ) + ( − 1 ) m F ∓ ( ξ ) ] + 1 τ (cid:26) 1 2 π Z 2 π 0 d θF ∓ ( r + D e θ ) − F ± ( r ) (cid:27) , ( 5 ) where the radial interaction kernel K ( r ) = − Z π − π d θ Z π − π d φχ ( x 1 0 , φ , x 1 r , θ ) sin [ m ( φ − θ ) ] e θ 4 π ( 6 ) is shown in Fig . 4a , b . ( see [ 28 ] for details ) . The interac - tion is short - range : K ( r ) = 0 for | r | > D + 1 . In the polar case ( m = 1 ) , it is attractive ( repulsive ) between vortices with the same ( opposite ) sign of ω . In the nematic case ( m = 2 ) , the interaction has a short - range attractive part and a medium range repulsive part . We examined the stability of a homogeneous state F + = F − = ρ 0 / 2 . Linearizing Eqs . ( 5 ) , we obtain af - ter Fourier transform d F k ± d t = (cid:18) ( − 1 ) m + 1 πDα | k | K | k | ρ 0 + J 0 ( | k | D ) τ (cid:19) F k ∓ − (cid:18) πDα | k | K | k | ρ 0 + 1 τ (cid:19) F k ± . ( 7 ) J n is the n - th Bessel function of the ﬁrst kind , and K k = R D + 1 0 d r J 1 ( kr ) re ( 0 ) · K ( re ( 0 ) ) . Examining the eigenvalues of Eq .

In the nematic case , due to the conservation of particles , the most unstable mode F + + F − is neutral at | k | = 0 , see Fig . 4 ( d ) . The corresponding amplitude equation is the conserved Swift - Hohenberg equation [ 37 ] .

In the polar ( nematic ) interaction case , ρ 0 τ = 20 ( 17 ) . consistent with our ﬁndings . In the polar case , the un - stable mode F + − F − would yield the conventional Swift - Hohenberg equation with cubic nonlinearity . But conser - vation of particles implies that the unstable mode cou - ples to the neutral mode F + + F − at | k | = 0 . A square lattice is then expected [ 38 ] , again in agreement with our results . Numerical integration of Eqs . ( 5 ) conﬁrms that for ρ 0 τ > c min the correct periodic lattice emerges , Fig . 4e , f . The instability condition ρ 0 τ > c min is in semi - quantitative agreement with simulations of the particle models with TN . To summarize , we have shown that memory , in the form of underdamped angular dynamics , is a crucial in - gredient for the collective properties of self - propelled par - ticles . Our Vicsek - style models exhibit a prominent vor - tex lattice phase at high density and large memory . With nematic alignment an hexagonal lattice emerges , but po - lar interactions lead to a checkerboard square lattice of alternating vortices , a fact explained by the calculation . We have also shown the emergence of a number of col - lective states for moderate memory times . In particular , we observed the emergence , out of purely nematic inter - actions , of global , long - range , polar order made of Vicsek waves . We also reported that nematic interactions can give rise to a system of traveling polar lanes . Such lan - ing conﬁgurations have been reported for overdamped self - propelled elongated objects interacting via steric ex - clusion [ 33 ] . Thus repeated collisions between these rods seem to amount to some eﬀective memory . Laning may in fact be best characterized this way , and not necessarily by the aspect ratio of particles . Even though smooth trajectories with persistent cur - vature are observed for birds , swimmers , etc . , the stud - ied models are probably most suited for self - organization 5 phenomena in in vitro mixtures of bioﬁlaments and motor proteins such as motility assays . Nematic vortices were already reported in [ 10 ] , and Vicsek wave - like patterns in [ 9 ] . We are conﬁdent that some of the other phases reported here are also present in such systems .
