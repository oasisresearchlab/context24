With the aim of improving endosomal release , a poorly understood and inefficient process , we studied the uptake and cytosolic release of siRNAs , formulated in lipoplexes or lipid nanoparticles , by live - cell imaging and correlated it with knockdown of a target GFP reporter . siRNA release occurred invariably from maturing endosomes within ~ 5 – 15 min of endocytosis . Cytosolic galectins immediately recognized the damaged endosome and targeted it for autophagy . However , inhibiting autophagy did not enhance cytosolic siRNA release . Gene knockdown occurred within a few hours of release and required < 2 , 000 copies of cytosolic siRNAs . The ability to detect cytosolic release of siRNAs and understand how it is regulated will facilitate the development of rational strategies for improving the cytosolic delivery of candidate drugs . Cytosolic delivery is the major obstacle to siRNA drug development .

A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t acids , called lipoplexes 2 . However , because of their size , charge and toxicity , they are not suitable for in vivo use . Smaller ( 50 – 100 nm ) homogeneous lipid nanoparticles ( LNP ) , formed by mixing siRNAs with PEGylated and cationic lipids and cholesterol , are the furthest advanced in clinical studies 3 – 5 . These LNPs are ionizable ( neutral at physiological pH , but protonated in endosomes ) , which facilitates fusion of their lipids with the endosomal membrane and enables cytosolic RNA delivery . LNPs carrying transthyretin siRNAs cause durable gene knockdown in the liver ( > 80 % knockdown lasting weeks after one injection 6 ) with manageable toxicity . These are currently being evaluated in phase 3 clinical trials to treat familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy . LNPs are trapped in the liver and generally cause effective gene knockdown only in that organ . Both lipoplexes and LNPs are taken up by endocytosis , but most of their cargo accumulates in late endosomes and lysosomes , where they are not active 7 – 9 . Figuring out how to improve cytosolic release is hampered by a lack of tools to detect the endosomal escape of nucleic acids . Previous microscopy studies of endocytosed lipoplexes or LNPs either have not directly visualized cytosolic release 8 , 9 or have detected a gradual increase of RNA - oligonucleotide cargo in the cytosol without clearly linking it to knockdown or mechanism 7 , 10 . Visualizing endosomal release in live cells is challenging because small amounts of released siRNAs must be detected simultaneously with intensely fluorescent endosomes that are densely packed with lipoplexed siRNA . To handle the large dynamic range , we developed an imaging approach similar to the high - dynamic - range ( HDR ) technique used in digital cameras . Cells were imaged with two different exposure settings using a spinning - disk microscope equipped with an electron - multiplying charge - coupled device ( EMCCD ) camera . Multiple planes encompassing most of the cellular volume were acquired with short exposure times and a dynamic range adjusted to the bright structures within the cells ( the intact lipoplexes and vesicles ) . Then a single plane in the lower third of the cell was captured with a long exposure time , intentionally overexposing bright areas to detect the weakly fluorescent siRNA signal in the cytosol ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . Using this technique , we observed sudden cytosolic release of Alexa Fluor 647 – labeled siRNAs ( siRNA - AF647 ) that originated from intensely fluorescent lipoplex - containing vesicles ( Fig . 1a and Supplementary Movie 1 ) . The released siRNAs rapidly diffused and filled the entire cytosol within 10 – 20 s , suggesting that free siRNAs , rather than intact lipoplexes , escaped into the cytosol . Although cytosolic release was detected in a single plane , the method was sensitive enough to detect release events that occurred outside that plane . Typically between one and five release events were observed per cell over several hours . The fluorescence intensity of the releasing particle usually increased gradually 1 – 2 min before release and then suddenly dropped , concurrently with detection of the cytosolic signal ( Fig . 1b ) . The releasing vesicle’s fluorescence was reduced by only a fraction of its intensity and did not decline further with time . Thus only some cargo was released , and the leaky vesicle did not continue to release its cargo . Therefore , the membrane of the releasing endosome did not rupture . Because fluorophores in close proximity are self - quenched , we interpreted the initial increase in fluorescence as a sign of partial disintegration of the lipoplexes that resulted in dequenching . The sudden drop in fluorescence reflected the actual release event Wittrup et al . Page 2 Nat Biotechnol . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2015 November 30 . A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t and coincided with a sudden increase in cytosolic siRNA fluorescence adjacent to the releasing vesicle ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . siRNA release coincided , in many cases , with small cytosolic Ca 2 + transients , of variable magnitude as measured using the Fluo - 4 Ca 2 + sensor , which originated from the damaged endosome ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . Laser illumination during imaging did not affect the probability of cytosolic release of the siRNA ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . To correlate release events with target gene knockdown , we first used flow cytometry to study lipoplex - mediated gene knockdown in HeLa cells that were stably expressing destabilized eGFP ( HeLa - d1 - eGFP ) 11 with an ~ 1 - h half - life ( t 1 / 2 ) . HeLa - d1 - eGFP cells were incubated with dilutions of lipoplexes containing fluorescent siRNAs targeting eGFP ( siGFP - AF647 ) . Although most cells internalized siGFP - AF647 lipoplexes , eGFP knockdown was an all - or - nothing phenomenon at all lipoplex concentrations tested ( Fig . 1c ) , which suggested that endosomal release was a discrete limiting step of knockdown . Although more cells showed knockdown at higher siRNA concentrations , the extent of knockdown was dose independent . Next we simultaneously monitored eGFP fluorescence and cytosolic siRNA delivery over several hours in HeLa - d1 - eGFP cells incubated with fluorescent siGFP lipoplexes ( Fig . 1d and Supplementary Movie 2 ) . In cells that showed siGFP - AF647 endosomal release , eGFP fluorescence began to decrease ~ 60 min after release and had a t 1 / 2 of ~ 115 min ( Fig . 1e ) . In control cells treated with cycloheximide , which stopped protein synthesis , eGFP fluorescence began to decline after a delay of ~ 18 min , with a t 1 / 2 of ~ 45 min after cycloheximide treatment . Thus , cytosolic delivery of siRNAs caused rapid knockdown . Although we could not exclude the possibility that there were small amounts of siRNA leakage that we could not detect , the all - or - nothing knockdown response together with the synchronization of knockdown following the first release event , and its rapidity , suggest that the release events observed here are the dominant pathway for lipoplex - mediated siRNA cytosolic delivery . To estimate how many cytosolic copies of the siRNAs are needed for complete knockdown , the siRNA - AF647 concentration in the cytosol just after release was estimated by comparing the cytosolic fluorescence of cells with a reference curve for the fluorescence intensities of droplet preparations spanning a range of siRNA - AF647 concentrations ( measured with the same imaging setup , linear range : < 1 – 1 , 000 nM , R 2 = 0 . 9992 ) . Lipoplexes containing more siRNAs ( using a fixed amount of lipid ) released progressively more cytosolic siRNAs ( Fig . 1f ) . However , knockdown kinetics were indistinguishable between cells with widely different cytosolic concentrations of siGFP ( Fig . 1g ) . Assuming an average cell volume of 2 , 000 fl , the lowest quartile of cells contained on average ~ 2 , 000 cytosolic siRNAs , while the highest quartile had ~ 200 , 000 cytosolic molecules . This calculation suggests that < 2 , 000 cytosolic siRNAs / cell caused maximal knockdown , in agreement with previous estimates 7 , 12 , 13 . In comparison , HeLa - d1 - eGFP cells contained 1 , 326 ± 63 ( mean ± s . d . ) eGFP mRNA molecules / cell by qRT - PCR analysis . Because we could identify the releasing endosome by its change in siRNA fluorescence ( Fig . 1b ) , we next characterized the stage in endosomal maturation at which release Wittrup et al .

A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t occurred . HeLa cells expressing GFP - tagged endosomal marker proteins were incubated with fluorescent lipoplexes to identify the properties of the releasing vesicle ( Fig . 2 ) . Lipoplex - containing vesicles associated with the early endosome marker EEA1 ( ref . 14 ) before release , but became EEA1 − just before release ( Fig . 2a , b and Supplementary Movie 3 ) . Release occurred 5 . 5 min ( median , 4 – 9 min , 25 – 75 percentile , n = 35 ) after maximal GFP - EEA1 intensity . In GFP - Rab5 – expressing HeLa cells , the releasing endosome also became Rab5 + a few minutes before release ( Fig . 2c , d and Supplementary Movie 4 ) . Release occurred about 3 min ( median , 1 – 3 . 5 min , 25 – 75 percentiles , n = 20 ) after GFP - Rab5 intensity reached its maximum , when endosomes are normally still Rab5 + . In many cases the lateral mobility of lipoplex - containing vesicles increased sharply around the time of GFP - Rab5 recruitment , indicating maturation into a mobile endosome ( Supplementary Movie 4 and data not shown ) . Thus , the majority of release events occurred about 5 – 10 min after lipoplexes were taken up into the cell . Endosomes undergo a Rab5 to Rab7 conversion during maturation to late endosomes 15 , 16 . GFP - Rab7 was recruited to lipoplex - containing endosomes a few minutes before release and remained associated after release ( Fig . 2e , f and Supplementary Movie 5 ) . By contrast , the late endosomal ( Rab9 ) and lysosomal ( LAMP1 ) markers were just being recruited or completely absent , respectively , at the time of release ( Fig . 2g , h ) . The vesicle remnants became LAMP1 + 40 – 50 min after release , when they became lysosomes . Thus lipoplexed siRNAs are released from EEA1 − Rab5 + Rab7 + Rab9 ± Lamp1 − maturing endosomes ( Fig . 2i ) during a narrow time window within 5 – 15 min of uptake . The endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) was not recruited to the releasing endosome ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . Previous studies have shown that delivered siRNAs begin to be loaded into Ago2 - RISC complexes , which localize near the ER 13 , 17 , after 30 min , but we did not study these later events . We next asked whether endosomal maturation contributes to siRNA release using HeLa - d1 - eGFP cells overexpressing either wild - type ( WT ) or dominant - negative ( DN ) Rab5 or Rab7 . Neither Rab construct affected lipoplex uptake ( Fig . 2j ) . However , DN Rab7 , but not DN Rab5 , impaired knockdown ( Fig . 2k ) , suggesting that Rab7 activity promotes endosomal siRNA escape . Given its central role in early endosomal maturation 16 , it is unclear why inhibiting Rab5 did not affect uptake and knockdown . It is possible that lipoplexes are routed through a Rab5 - independent pathway or that compensatory mechanisms are triggered by Rab5 inhibition . We next studied whether inhibiting endosomal acidification ( with the V - ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A1 or with chloroquine ) affected knockdown . Both drugs reduced knockdown ( Fig . 2l ) . Thus , endosome maturation enhances siRNA knockdown , presumably because it promotes release . Transfection reagents induce autophagy 18 , 19 . siRNA escape , which presumably results from a damaged endosomal membrane , could trigger macroautophagy of the releasing endosome . HeLa cells transfected with tandem - fluorescent LC3 ( tfLC3 ) ( ref . 20 ) , in which LC3 is fused to a pH - sensitive eGFP and a pH - insensitive mRFP , were used to detect autophagy . Within a few minutes of endosomal release , LC3 was recruited to the damaged endosome ( Fig . 3a – c ) . Wittrup et al . Page 4 Nat Biotechnol .

A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A characteristic cup - shaped membrane engulfed and sealed off the damaged vesicle ( Supplementary Movie 6 ) . About 30 – 50 min later , the GFP - LC3 signal disappeared , whereas the mRFP - LC3 signal was retained ( Fig . 3d ) , which indicated entry of the endosome into an acidic lysosomal compartment . This timing was consistent with LAMP1 detection on endosomes ~ 40 – 50 min after siRNA release ( Fig . 2h ) . Thus , endosomal escape triggers macroautophagic isolation of the releasing endosome . We then asked how autophagy is activated . Cytosolic carbohydrate - sensing galectins are recruited to endosomes damaged by cytosolic invasion by bacteria 12 , 21 , when endosomal glycans become exposed to the cytosol . To determine whether galectin recruitment might trigger autophagy , we used HeLa cells to express YFP - tagged versions of all the cytosolic galectins and found that they stained the cytoplasm diffusely under basal conditions ( Fig . 3e ) . In lipoplex - treated cells , galectin - 8 and galectin - 9 were strongly recruited to the releasing endosome within seconds , galectin - 3 was weakly recruited , and galectin - 1 and galectin - 4 were barely recruited ( Fig . 3f – h ) . These differences may reflect differences in carbohydrate recognition by the galectins , which are not well characterized . In a few cases , galectins were detected on the vesicle 1 – 2 min before we detected cytosolic siRNAs , presumably due to limited or transient endosomal damage and release that was below our limit of detection . For most of the release events , galectins were recruited within 5 – 10 s of cytosolic siRNA detection . As galectin - 8 was uniformly cytosolic in undisturbed cells , galectin - 8 recruitment could be used to identify the siRNA - releasing endosomes ( Fig . 3i and Supplementary Movie 7 ) . The autophagic double membrane around a releasing endosome might limit further siRNA release . Indeed , a recent report suggests that lipoplex - mediated plasmid DNA delivery is restricted by autophagy 19 . During microbial invasion 3 , 12 , activation of autophagy occurs by a noncanonical pathway that depends on galectin - 8 and the adaptor NDP52 . Knockdown of either galectin - 8 or NDP52 severely impaired LC3 recruitment to damaged endosomes , whereas galectin - 3 knockdown had no effect ( Fig . 3j , k ) . ( We were unable to knock down galectin - 9 . ) However , neither galectin - 8 nor NDP52 knockdown enhanced target gene knockdown ( Fig . 3l ) . Thus , something other than autophagy limits siRNA release . siRNA and plasmid DNA release might be differentially sensitive to autophagy because siRNAs diffuse more rapidly than larger plasmid DNAs . To determine whether LNP - formulated siRNAs traffic like lipoplexed siRNA , we studied LNPs that contained the ionizable lipid L319 ( a biodegradable derivative of DLin - MC3 - DMA ) , distearoylphosphatidylcholine , cholesterol , 1 , 2 - dimyristoyl - sn - glycerol and methoxypolyethylene glycol 22 , which resemble LNPs currently in clinical trials 6 , 23 . These small LNPs , which carry much less siRNA than the larger lipoplexes , were efficiently internalized ( Fig . 4a ) . Each cell took up more than 100 LNPs over several hours . After a lag phase of 1 – 2 h , which corresponded to a lag in endocytosis , the kinetics of LNP - mediated knockdown closely tracked those of lipoplex - mediated knockdown ( Fig . 4b ) . Thus , knockdown occurred rapidly after endocytosis . However , like other groups 7 , 8 , we could not detect siRNA release from LNPs , presumably because of their smaller cargo . For those particles whose fluorescence intensity changed , we could not reliably assess whether this was due to endosomal escape or to acquisition - related errors from bleaching , statistical Wittrup et al .

A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t fluctuations or movement relative to the imaging plane . However , we could use galectin - 8 recruitment as a surrogate for endosomal release . Indeed , when HeLa cells expressing YFP – galectin - 8 were incubated with siRNA - AF647 LNPs , multiple galectin - 8 foci appeared progressively after an initial lag phase of ~ 1 . 5 – 2 h ( Fig . 4c and Supplementary Movie 8 ) . Galectin - 8 foci only formed on LNP - fluorescent vesicles ( Fig . 4d and Supplementary Movie 9 ) , but only a small fraction of internalized LNPs ( ~ 7 % , 62 of 862 LNP - containing vesicles in 10 cells ) recruited galectin - 8 , suggesting that most internalized LNPs did not release their cargo . Galectin - 8 recruitment coincided with a sudden reduction of siRNA - AF647 fluorescence , thereby confirming that galectin recruitment could be used to identify releasing vesicles ( Fig . 4e ) . Some individual LNP traces increased fluorescence just before release ( data not shown ) , indicating possible disintegration and dequenching as observed for lipoplexes . Vesicular fluorescence after release was reduced by ~ 50 % , suggesting that about half of the siRNAs in the LNPs were released during each event . Thus , ~ 3 . 5 % of internalized siRNAs in LNPs were delivered into the cytosol . To identify in which endosomal compartment release occurred , we incubated HeLa cells expressing mCherry – galectin - 8 and GFP - tagged endosomal markers with siRNA - AF647 LNPs and used galectin - 8 recruitment to time cytosolic release . Galectin - 8 recruitment occurred after EEA1 fluorescence disappeared and both before and after Rab5 fluorescence reached its peak ( Fig . 4f , g and Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . Most galectin - 8 recruitment occurred before vesicles became Rab7 + ( Fig . 4h ) and always before they became LAMP1 + ( Fig . 4i ) . Unreleased siRNAs accumulated in LAMP1 + lysosomes from which there was no further release ( Fig . 4j ) . Like lipoplexes , LNP vesicles were also targeted for autophagy , and a subset became LC3 + ( Supplementary Fig . 7 ) . Thus , LNP siRNAs were released from EEA1 − Rab5 + Rab7 ± LAMP1 − maturing endosomes over a narrow ~ 10 - min time window , which was somewhat earlier than that for lipoplexed siRNAs , which were released from Rab7 + endosomes ( many of which had acquired Rab9 ) . The slight difference in the stage of endosomal maturation at which lipoplexes and LNPs release RNA may reflect differences in their pH sensitivities and physical characteristics . Here we developed an imaging method to visualize endosomal escape of siRNAs from lipoplexes and LNPs . For both , cytosolic release occurred from maturing endosomes ( Fig . 4k ) and triggered the autophagic isolation of the releasing endosome . A previous mathematical model also suggested that LNP siRNAs are released early in the endosomal pathway 7 . It is worth noting that LNPs containing ionizable lipids with p K a s in the range of the maturing endosome pH ( 6 – 7 ( ref . 24 ) or 6 . 2 – 6 . 5 ( ref . 25 ) ) knock down gene expression most efficiently . siRNA release occurred during a narrow ‘window of opportunity’ . No release occurred from late endosomes or lysosomes . We do not know what limits release from these compartments . Although autophagic isolation and subsequent fusion with the lysosome would be expected to terminate release , inhibiting autophagy did not enhance knockdown or increase release . This suggests that other factors that act before autophagy is complete—such as changes in cholesterol , lipid and protein composition that accompany endosomal maturation—might regulate release .

A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t To our knowledge , this is the first study to show that nonmicrobial endosomal damage triggers autophagy through a galectin - 8 – dependent pathway . As glycoproteins and glycolipids are typically excluded from the cytosol , these glycan sensors might act as alarms to inform the cell about cytosolic invasion . However , we did not detect innate immune or inflammasome activation in lipoplex - or LNP - treated cells ( data not shown ) . It will be interesting to see whether the imaging methods developed here can be applied to follow the cytosolic delivery of endocytosed nucleic acids and other large molecules , such as antibodies , by other delivery approaches . These include siRNA delivery strategies , such as conjugates to N - acetylgalactosamine ( GalNAc ) 3 or aptamers 26 , which have shown in vivo efficacy . Because GalNAc - conjugates are monomeric and are not delivered as particles , detecting their release may be challenging unless they are released in packets , their endosomal escape also activates galectin sensors , or more sensitive single - molecule imaging methods are developed . In this study , the detection limit for cytosolic siRNA was ~ 0 . 5 nM . The molecular basis of endosomal release is not well understood . The ability to detect both the released contents and the releasing endosome at the very moment of release ( by assaying galectin recruitment ) should provide a valuable tool to characterize the process and the molecules involved . It could provide insights into how to modulate intracellular sorting or enable screening of endosome - destabilizing compounds . It should also help in the design and optimization of delivery strategies that can overcome the endosomal - release bottleneck that thwarts effective intracellular therapeutics for siRNAs and other large - molecule drugs .

LNPs were prepared using ionizable lipid L319 , distearoylphosphatidylcholine ( DSPC ) , cholesterol and PEG - DMG at a molar ratio of 55 : 10 : 32 . 5 : 2 . 5 ( L319 : DSPC : cholesterol : PEG - DMG ) according to the procedure in ref . 22 . Spinning - disk confocal microscopy image acquisition Images were acquired with a spinning disk confocal head ( Yokogawa ) coupled to a fully motorized epifluorescence microscope ( Axio Observer ) equipped with a 63× lens ( Plan Apochromat , 1 . 4 numerical aperture ( NA ) , Carl Zeiss ) and a 40× lens ( Plan Apochromat , 1 . 2 NA , Carl Zeiss ) . Three 50 - mW solid - state lasers ( 491 , 561 and 660 nm ; cobalt laser ) , coupled to the spinning head through an acoustic - optical tunable filter ( AOTF ) , were used as light source . The imaging system operates under control of SlideBook 5 . 0 and an EMCCD camera ( Quant - EM , Hamamatsu ) was used to acquire images . HDR live - cell imaging of lipoplex uptake Cells transfected with fluorescent fusion proteins were transfected 72 – 96 h before imaging , with an Amaxa Nucleofector ( Lonza ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions for HeLa cells ( Kit R ) . Cells were plated on 25 - mm poly - L - lysine – coated coverslips 12 – 24 h before imaging . Coverslips were transferred to a sample holder ( 20 / 20 Technology , Inc . ) and 900 µl DMEM without phenol red , supplemented with 10 % FCS , 2 mM glutamine , 20 mM HEPES was added . The sample holder was then put in the microscope within an environmental chamber , maintained at 37 °C , 5 % CO 2 and 100 % humidity , containing the objective lenses . siRNA - AF647 or siRNA - Cy3 and Lipofectamine 2000 was precomplexed for 15 min at room temperature in OptiMEM ( Gibco ) ( 100 : 4 : 96 , pmol : µl : µl , siRNA : Lipofectamine 2000 : OptiMEM ) , to obtain a 1000 nM lipoplex solution . Cells were then selected for subsequent imaging . For nucleofected cells , low transgene expressing cells were chosen . Then , 100 µl siRNA - solution was added ( 100 nM final siRNA concentration ) , and image acquisition started immediately . During acquisition , normally 14 z - planes , 0 . 7 µm apart were acquired with 30 - ms exposures of the siRNA - AF647 channel and ~ 100 - ms exposures in the GFP channel ( for endocytic marker – expressing cells ) . After all z - planes were acquired , a single long exposure ( generally 300 ms ) in the lower third of the cell was acquired in the siRNA - AF647 channel ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . When permitted by frame rate , multiple positions were imaged in parallel . For visualization purposes , the display lookup table ( LUT ) is skewed to enhance weak signals in the images ( i . e . , cytosolic siRNA ) . In experiments with varying siRNA to transfection lipid ratios , the Lipofectamine 2000 amount was kept constant ( 4 µl ) while either 2 , 10 or 100 pmol siRNA - AF647 was Wittrup et al .

Calcium imaging HeLa cells were preloaded with the Fluo - 4 acetoxymethyl calcium indicator ( Life Technologies ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . 100 nM siRNA - AF647 lipoplexes were added to the cells and imaging of a single plane was started immediately using a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope with a 40× objective ( Plan Apochromat , 1 . 3 NA , Carl Zeiss ) . The maximal field of view was acquired , intentionally overexposing the siRNA channel to detect the cytosolic siRNA signal . Quantification of lipoplex associated fluorescence intensity The fluorescence intensity of siRNA - releasing endosomes was analyzed from confocal microscopy images using SlideBook 5 . 0 software . A segmentation mask was created using the siRNA - AF647 signal in maximum projection time - lapse images ( short exposures ) . The identified particles were tracked over time following the center of intensity . Releasing endosomes were identified manually as follows : 1 ) cells exhibiting sudden increases in cytosolic siRNA - AF647 fluorescence were identified from long exposure images ; 2 ) the siRNA - AF647 fluorescence intensity of all identified particles in that cell was examined ; and 3 ) if one , and only one , particle within that cell changed significantly in fluorescence intensity , this particle was identified as the releasing particle , otherwise , the endosomal escape event was discarded in the analysis . Fluorescence intensity traces were then shifted in time with t = 0 for all release events , or in some cases , t = 0 at the maximal endocytic marker fluorescence intensity . Endosomal marker fluorescence intensity values were normalized to 0 – 1 for every trace , with 0 being the background ( autofluorescence ) intensity as determined in untransfected cells , and 1 being the highest intensity value in each trace to compensate for variations in expression levels . To compare the relative abundance of the different GFP - labeled endocytic markers at the time of release , background - corrected , normalized GFP fluorescence intensities of the releasing endosomes ( average of the frame before and after release ) was calculated . Flow cytometry HeLa or HeLa - d1 - eGFP cells were plated 24 h before start of incubation . For experiments with a fixed ratio of siRNA to cationic lipid , a 1 , 000 - nM lipoplex solution was mixed ( 100 : 4 : 96 , pmol : µl : µl , siRNA : Lipofectamine 2000 : OptiMEM ) . Aliquots of this solution were added to cells in fresh DMEM , with 10 % FCS , to obtain the desired final siRNA concentration . After incubation , cells were washed once with PBS , followed by a wash in CellScrub Wash Buffer ( Genlantis ) and one more PBS wash . Cells were then removed from plates by trypsin digestion , resuspended and washed twice with FACS buffer ( PBS , 0 . 5 % BSA , 10 mM HEPES ) . Fluorescence was analyzed on a FACSCanto ( BD ) or FACSAria ( BD ) cell analyzer using FlowJo software ( Tree Star ) . For LNP incubations , cells were incubated with LNPs dissolved in DMEM , 10 % FCS and 1 . 5 µg / ml recombinant apolipoprotein E3 ( ApoE3 , R & D Systems ) . After incubation , cells Wittrup et al .

A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t were washed once with PBS , trypsinized and analyzed by flow cytometry as described above . Live - cell eGFP expression measurements To assess the half - life of destabilized d1 - eGFP , HeLa - d1 - eGFP cells were plated 24 h before imaging . After transfer to the microscope , 10 µg / ml cycloheximide ( Sigma ) in DMSO was added to the cells and six positions were imaged in parallel every 3 min for 5 h with a 40× objective . Control cells receiving only DMSO were imaged in a separate acquisition . In the acquired images , cells were tracked over time using an in - house – developed tracking algorithm implemented in the open - source CellProfiler ( MIT ) software package . Relative changes in eGFP expression were quantified by measuring the average signal intensity of every tracked cell ( normalized to 1 at t = 0 for cycloheximide - treated cells and to 1 throughout the acquisition for the untreated cells ) . To assess the kinetics of siRNA - mediated knockdown of eGFP , HeLa - d1 - eGFP cells were plated 24 h before imaging . Coverslips were transferred to a sample holder and 900 µl ice - cold DMEM ( with 10 % FCS ) was added followed by 100 µl siGFP - AF647 lipoplex solution ( 100 : 4 : 96 , pmol : µl : µl , siRNA : Lipofectamine 2000 : OptiMEM ) . Cells were then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C in the dark and finally transferred to fresh medium at 37 °C and imaged using spinning - disk confocal microscopy for 12 h with a 40× objective . This procedure ensured that the majority of cells had either one or no release event . Relative changes to eGFP fluorescence levels , in cells experiencing cytosolic release events , was quantified as described above . t = 0 was set to time of release for each cell and the intensity level of nonreleasing cells was set to 1 throughout the acquisition . Intracellular siRNA concentration estimation In time - lapse images acquired during lipoplex – siRNA - AF647 incubations , the cytosolic siRNA - AF647 fluorescence after release was quantified as the difference in median cellular siRNA - AF647 fluorescence before and after release . Thus , the fluorescence increase of the ‘typical’ cytosolic pixel was quantified ; this was practically unaffected by the fluorescence of bright vesicles and intact lipoplexes . This cytosolic siRNA - AF647 fluorescence was then converted to an estimated cytosolic siRNA concentration through the use of a reference curve . An siRNA - AF647 reference concentration curve was established by measuring four - fold dilutions of siRNA - AF647 between 1 and 1 , 000 nM in a cytosol - mimicking buffer ( 15 g / l BSA , 125 mM KCl , 4 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 14 mM NaCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 20 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 2 ) . An ~ 10 - µm high liquid column of these solutions were imaged ( in triplicate ) using the same imaging conditions as in the live - cell eGFP measurements . Images were corrected for background fluorescence and uneven illumination , and the median fluorescence of the entire frame was then calculated . Interference with endosomal maturation HeLa - d1 - eGFP cells were nucleofected with dsRed - tagged Rab constructs ( WT and DN ) and plated for flow cytometry analysis . One day later the cells were put in fresh DMEM ( with 10 % FCS ) , and siGFP - AF647 lipoplexes ( 10 nM final siGFP - AF647 concentration ) were added . Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry 24 h later . Wittrup et al . Page 10 Nat Biotechnol . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2015 November 30 . A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t For drug treatments , HeLa - d1 - eGFP cells were plated for flow cytometry analysis , and one day later fresh DMEM ( with 10 % FCS ) containing 100 µM chloroquine ( Sigma ) or 100 nM bafilomycin A1 ( Sigma ) was added . After 1 h , one - tenth the volume of siGFP - AF647 lipoplex solution was added ( 0 . 2 – 25 nM final siGFP - AF647 concentration ) . Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry 24 h later . siRNA treatment HeLa cells were co - nucleofected with tfLC3 and 30 pmol siRNA , followed by a second nucleofection with 30 pmol siRNA the day after . The following day , cells were plated and 24 h later the cells were incubated with 100 nM siRNA - AF647 lipoplexes and imaged using spinning - disk confocal microscopy . The GFP - LC3 signal of releasing endosomes was quantified 15 min after release . For flow cytometry experiments , HeLa - d1 - eGFP cells were nucleofected with 30 pmol siRNA , followed by a second nucleofection with 30 pmol siRNA the day after . For ‘mock’ samples , cells were treated identically except for omission of the siRNA . Two days later , the cells were put in fresh medium and one - tenth the volume of lipoplex solution ( 0 . 1 – 0 . 4 : 4 : 96 , pmol : µl : µl , siRNA : Lipofectamine 2000 : OptiMEM ) was added . Cells were incubated for 12 h and analyzed by flow cytometry as described above . RNA from transfected and control cells was collected in TRIzol ( Life Technologies ) and extracted according to the manufacturer’s protocol . Total RNA ( 1 µg ) was converted to cDNA using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase ( Life Technologies ) . For qRT - PCR , 20 µl reactions containing SsoFast EvaGreen mastermix ( Bio - Rad ) , appropriate primers and template cDNAs made from 10 ng RNA were amplified on a Bio - Rad CFX 96 Thermal Cycler . qRT - PCR data were normalized to GAPDH or ACTB and to the expression level in siCtrl - treated cells . . LNP microscopy HeLa cells were nucleofected with YFP – galectin - 8 or conucleofected with expression plasmids for mCherry – galectin - 8 and GFP - tagged endosomal markers . Cells were prepared for microscopy 24 h later . LNP – siRNA - AF647 ( 50 nM ) in DMEM , 10 % FCS and 1 . 5 µg / ml ApoE3 was added to the cells . The cells were then incubated for 1 . 5 – 2 h at 37 °C before spinning - disk confocal imaging was started . To limit photobleaching and toxicity , only the lower half of the cells were imaged ( 8 z - planes , 0 . 5 µm apart ) at low illumination intensities for up to 45 min with frame rates of 10 – 30 s . Then new cells were selected and imaged up to a maximum of ~ 4 h after adding LNPs . LNP image analysis The fluorescence intensity of LNP – siRNA - AF647 – releasing endosomes was analyzed from maximum z - projection confocal microscopy images using SlideBook 5 . 0 software . Galectin - 8 – targeted LNPs were first identified . The targeted LNP was then tracked manually from the first frame of appearance with a circular mask ( diameter of 5 pixels ) . Local background fluorescence intensities were obtained from a donut - shaped mask around the particle mask . Local background – corrected fluorescence intensities of all galectin + LNPs Wittrup et al . Page 11 Nat Biotechnol . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2015 November 30 . A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t were then analyzed using a Matlab algorithm to identify the first frame of galectin positivity in an unbiased manner ( above a defined threshold ) . Fluorescence intensity traces were then shifted in time with t = 0 , for the time of galectin - 8 recruitment , or in some cases the maximal endocytic marker fluorescence intensity ( along a moving - average window ) . siRNA - AF647 and mCherry – galectin - 8 traces were normalized to 0 – 1 for every trace , with 0 being the background and 1 the highest value in each trace . Background - corrected endocytic marker ( GFP ) traces were normalized to the average cellular GFP fluorescence . To estimate the fraction of galectin - 8 + LNP vesicles , vesicles were counted and scored manually after 165 min of LNP incubation . Statistical analysis Data are expressed as mean ± s . d . ( s . d . ) . Shaded areas in intensity tracings are estimated 95 % confidence values of the calculated average , defined as the s . e . m . multiplied by 1 . 96 .
