Unraveling phosphatidylinositol 4 - kinase function in the yeast Golgi - endosomal system Dissertation Zur Erlangung des akademischen Grades Doktor rerum naturalium ( Dr . rer . nat . ) an der Fakultät Mathematik und Naturwissenschaften der Technischen Universität Dresden Von Lars Demmel Aus Merseburg Dresden , Juli 2005 Gutachter : Professor Dr . Bernard Hoflack , TU Dresden Dr . Christiane Walch - Solimena , MPI - CBG , Dresden Professor Dr . Gabriele Fischer von Mollard , Universität Bielefeld Eingereicht : 18 . Juli 2005 Verteidigt : 13 . September 2005 I Abstract In Saccharomyces cerevisiae , experiments with temperature - sensitive mutants of the PI4 - kinase Pik1p revealed that the PI4P pool generated by this enzyme is essential for Golgi morphology and normal secretory function and that the PI4P pool at the Golgi represents a regulatory signal on its own . In order to function as a spatial and temporal regulator of membrane traffic , PI4P synthesis and turnover must be tightly regulated . It remains elusive which factors are in - volved in the targeting and regulation of Pik1p . Little is also known about PI4P binding proteins mediating the effects of this phosphoinositide on Golgi function . Since it has been shown that multiple pathways leave the Golgi towards the plasma membrane one can ask the question whether Pik1p and its product PI4P specifically control one path - way ? Here we demonstrate an interaction of Pik1p with the 14 - 3 - 3 proteins Bmh1p and Bmh2p . Interestingly , overexpression of Bmh1p and Bmh2p results in multiple genetic interactions with genes involved in late steps of exocytosis and it affects the forward transport of the general amino acid permease Gap1p . The detected interaction depends on the phosphorylation state of Pik1p and Pik1p phosphorylation accompanies its shuttling out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm where presumably the binding to Bmh1 / 2p occurs . Therefore , we reason that these interactions might serve the sequestration of Pik1p away from the Golgi . This study reveals that Pik1p shows a strong effect on the delivery of Gap1p to the surface whereas the transport of exocytosis markers implicated in the direct Golgi - to - plasma membrane pathway are not significantly disturbed . Cells carrying a deletion of GGA2 also show a strong defect in delivery of Gap1p to the surface . In addition , pik1 - 101 gga2 Δ double mutants display synthetic genetic and membrane transport phenotypes and recruitment of Gga2 to the TGN partially depends on functional Pik1p . Therefore , our results suggest a role of Pik1p in the TGN to endosome pathway . II Zusammenfassung Experimente mit temperatur - sensitiven Mutanten von Pik1p haben gezeigt , dass der er - zeugte PI4P Pool erforderlich ist für Golgi Morphologie und normale Sekretion . Daraus folgt , dass PI4P selbst ein wichtiges regulatives Signal am Golgi Apparat ist . Um als räumlicher und zeitlicher Regulator des Membrantransports fungieren zu können , muss die Synthese von PI4P genau reguliert werden . Es verbleibt unklar , welche Faktoren in die Rekrutierung und Regulierung von Pik1p involviert sind . Weiterhin sind auch wenige PI4P bindende Proteine bekannt . Es wurde gezeigt , dass mehrere Pfade von Golgi zur Plasmamembran führen . Es stellt sich nun die Frage , ob Pik1p und sein Produkt PI4P einen speziellen Pfad kontrollieren ? Wir zeigen , dass Pik1p mit den 14 - 3 - 3 Proteinen Bmh1p und Bmh2p interagiert . Die Überexpression von Bmh1p und Bmh2p führt zu mehreren genetischen Interaktionen mit Genen , die eine Rolle in späteren Schritten der Exozytose spielen und hat einen Ef - fekt auf den Transport der ‘Allgemeinen Aminosäure Permease’ Gap1p vom Golgi zur Plasmamembran . Die Interaktion war nur nachweisbar , wenn Pik1p phosphoryliert war . Wir haben entdeckt , dass Pik1p Phosphorylierung einhergeht mit seinem Transport vom Zellkern in das Zytoplasma , wo höchstwahrscheinlich auch die Bindung zu Bmh1 / 2p stattfindet . Daher nehmen wir an , dass die Interaktion der Pik1p Sequestrierung vom Golgi Apparat dient . Unsere Ergebnisse zeigen , dass Pik1p eine Rolle spielt beim Transport von Gap1p zur Zelloberfläche , aber der Transport von Proteinen , die auf direktem Wege zur Plas - mamembran gelangen , nur unwesentlich beeinflusst ist . Zellen , die kein Gga2p besitzen , zeigen ebenso einen starken Defekt im Transport von Gap1p zur Zelloberfläche . Weiter - hin finden wir synthetische Effekte in pik1 - 101 gga2 Δ Doppelmutanten und das Gga2p zumindest zu einem gewissem Grad PI4P für seine Lokalisierung zum Golgi Apparat be - nötigt . Zusammenfassend legen unsere Ergebnisse nahe , dass Pik1p im Golgi zu Endo - somen Transport eine Rolle spielt .

Introduction A key feature of many eukaryotic cells such as neurons , some epithelial cells and even budding yeast is polarized secretion or delivery of membrane proteins . In order to reach the plasma membrane , proteins have to transit through various membrane - bounded organelles . The identity of these membrane - bounded organelles is maintained by proper sorting and delivery of proteins and lipids inhabiting these organelles . Lipids and proteins are transported between compartments via vesicular traffic [ 1 ] . This process requires the selective packaging of cargo into transport vesicles , which bud from a specific donor compartment , the movement of these vesicles and the tethering and fusion to the mem - brane of the acceptor organelle . 1 . 1 . Post Golgi transport in yeast 1 . 1 . 1 VPS and SEC genes in yeast A major sorting station within cells is the Golgi apparatus . In the Golgi of the bud - ding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , newly synthesized proteins are either sorted to - wards the vacuole or into the secretory pathway ( Figure 1 ) . 25 years ago , Novick and Schekman identified by genetic screening the first 23 genes required for secretion of the periplasmic enzyme invertase and involved in the maintenance of organelle morphology [ 2 , 3 ] . These essential genes were named SEC genes and were implicated in ER - to - Golgi , intra - Golgi and Golgi - to - plasma membrane transport . Analysis of the isolated genes re - vealed molecular mechanisms of membrane transport . Among the isolated genes were SEC4 and SEC2 . Temperature sensitive mutant alleles of sec4 and sec2 accumulate se - cretory vesicles ( SVs ) in the cytoplasm . Sec4p is the first small Rab GTPase found to regulate membrane transport . In its GTP - bound state , Sec4p is localized to forming SVs at the Golgi [ 4 , 5 ] . Sec2p , the GDP exchange factor for Sec4p , is a regulator of Sec4p 2 function and localizes via its C - terminus to the SVs and by this means enhances its GDP exchange activity for Sec4p . Thus , the localization of Sec2p to SVs is essential for vesi - cle transport [ 6 , 7 ] . Sec4p - GTP associates with Sec15p on SVs [ 8 ] . Sec15p itself is part of a large multisubunit complex ( Sec15p , Sec3p , Sec5p , Sec6p , Sec8p , Sec10p , Exo70p and Exo84p ) , called the exocyst , which is involved in the tethering of SVs to specific sites at the plasma membrane [ 9 ] . Thus , the exocyst is an effector of Sec4p . Although the sequence of necessary protein - protein interactions leading to the assembly of the exocyst has not been determined yet , Sec4p is considered to be the activator and , therefore , the main regulator of this process [ 9 ] . Besides the implication of Sec3p in the selection of the secretion site , the precise function of the other exocyst components is not well understood [ 10 ] . Further downstream of the exocyst complex , the SNARE - proteins Sso1 / 2p ( yeast syntaxin ) and Snc1 / 2p ( yeast synaptobrevin / VAMP ) as well as Sec9p ( yeast SNAP25 ) , Sec18p ( yeast NSF ) and Sec1p [ 11 , 12 ] control the fusion of vesicles with the plasma membrane . Early acting sec mutants block transport of both , vacuolar and cell surface proteins , whereas late - acting sec mutants do not affect the delivery of hydrolases to the vacuole [ 13 ] . Therefore , vacuolar proteins are segregated from secretory and plasma membrane proteins and packaged for transport to the vacuole separately [ 14 ] . In two independent screens for spontaneous mutants defective in vacuolar protein sorting , the VPS genes , which mediate the traffic from the late Golgi to the vacuole , were identified [ 15 - 17 ] . Most of the VPS genes are not essential and the hallmark of all vps mutants is the mis - sorting of vacuolar enzyme precursors ( e . g . carboxypeptidase Y ( CPY ) ) to the cell sur - face . The over 50 VPS genes fall in 5 mutant morphology - based groups corresponding to the transport step they are involved in . Class A VPS cells show wild type like morphol - ogy but display 1 - 3 vacuoles , the class B group shows fragmented vacuoles , indicating that these genes are required for the consumption of vesicles and late endosomes at the vacuole . In class C vps mutants , no vacuole is apparent indicating an involvement of these genes in the tethering and fusion of vesicles and late endosomes to the vacuole . Class D VPS genes have assigned role in late Golgi to late endosome transport . The dele - tion of class E VPS genes leads to the formation of a large aberrant multilamellar struc - ture adjacent to the vacuole [ 18 ] . This structure is called class E compartment [ 16 , 19 - 3 25 ] . Most of the class E VPS genes belong to the heteromeric protein complexes , ESCRT - I to ESCRT - III , and function sequentially in sorting into the multivesicular body ( MVB ) pathway and the formation of the internal vesicles of MVBs ( reviewed in [ 26 ] ) . In yeast , a direct route from the Golgi to the vacuole exists . This pathway is con - trolled by the adaptor complex AP - 3 and depends on the clathrin - like protein Vps41p [ 27 , 28 ] . As described above , proteins involved in the transport of SVs and the late stages of secretion have been isolated . Temperature sensitive mutants of late - acting sec genes ac - cumulate vesicles within the cytosol because of their inability to fuse with the plasma membrane . Deletion mutants of vps genes show defects in sorting of vacuolar proteins . However , only a few mutants with a defect in vesicle budding from the late Golgi have been isolated . Among these proteins involved in post - Golgi budding are Sec14p ( yeast phosphatidylinositol transfer protein ) , Sec7p ( yeast Arf1p GEF ) , Ypt31 / 32p ( yeast Rab GTPases ) and Pik1p ( yeast phosphatidylinositol 4 - kinase ) . Temperature - sensitive mu - tants of the corresponding genes accumulate Golgi membranes and show a block in se - cretion [ 29 - 34 ] . 4 Figure 1 Overview of the yeast secretory and vacuolar sorting pathways Transmembrane proteins as well as secreted proteins are synthesized in the ER , transported to the Golgi mediated by early - acting Sec proteins . The Golgi represents a major protein sorting station within the cell . Biosynthethic cargo is transported to the plasma membrane directy or indirectly through an endosomal compartment . Vacuolar proteins or proteins destined for degradation reach the vacuole transiting endoso - mal compartments . The yeast early endosome is defined as a compartment positive for the t - SNARE Tlg1p , the late endosome is positive for the t - SNARE Pep12p and multivesicular bodies ( MVBs ) are negative for both SNARE proteins but instead show intra - lumenal vesicles . In contrast to the mammalian system , the yeast MVB structures are downstream of the late endosome . There are remarkable insights into the mecha - nisms of vacuolar protein sorting by the ESCRT machinery . It is furthermore well investigated how vesi - cles traffic through the cytoplasm and how they find the site of exocytosis . Also , the tethering ( exocyst ) and fusion machinery ( SNARE pairs , Sec1p , Sec9p ) at the plasma membrane is well understood . In contrast , little is known about the molecules involved in vesicle budding / fission at the Golgi , especially for surface delivery . 5 1 . 1 . 2 Two distinct classes of secretory vesicles Since cargo proteins leave the Golgi on distinct routes , one might wonder whether different kinds of SVs exist . The size of post - Golgi vesicles is about 100 nm . These vesi - cles accumulate at the restrictive temperature in sec6 mutants within the cytoplasm [ 3 ] . Using differential centrifugation and gradient fractionation , Edina Harsay and Anthony Bretscher were able to isolate 2 populations of vesicles differing in their density [ 35 ] . The markers used for high density secretory vesicles ( HDSV ) were periplasmic and secreted proteins , invertase and acid phosphatase respectively , whereas the major plasma mem - brane ATPase Pma1p and the cell wall component Bgl2p fractionate with light density secretory vesicles ( LDSV ) [ 35 ] . The authors argue that LDSV are delivered in a more polarized fashion and that HDSV transport cargos , which do not require precise targeting to a specific site at the cell surface . In addition , since both vesicle populations can be isolated from sec6 mutants , the machinery for tethering ( exocyst complex ) and fusion ( Sec1p , Sec9p , Snc1 / 2p , Sso1 / 2p ) of both types of vesicles with the plasma membrane might be the same . The question arising is whether these two distinct vesicle populations reach the plasma membrane via different transport routes . Biosynthetic transport from the Golgi to the endosomal system depends on the action of Vps1p ( yeast dynamin ) and clathrin [ 36 , 37 ] . In sec6 - 4 vps1 ∆ double mutants , the formation of HDSV was abolished and the HDSV marker invertase was instead found together with Pma1p in LDSVs . The same result was obtained in sec6 - 4 vps4 ∆ , sec6 - 4 pep12 ∆ and sec6 - 4 chc1 - 521 double mutants [ 38 , 39 ] . Vps4p is required for the formation of endosome - derived vesicles [ 40 ] and Pep12p has been identified as late endosome t - SNARE [ 21 , 41 ] . In contrast , sec6 double mutants with mutants blocking the direct pathway from the trans - Golgi to the vacuole ( e . g . sec6 - 4 apl6 ∆ ) have no effect on sorting of invertase to HDSVs [ 39 ] . It has also been found that missorted CPY is secreted in LDSV in vps1 ∆ mutants . Interestingly , in snc1 ala43 vps34 ∆ mutants , accumulating both types of vesicles , CPY is still secreted in LDSVs whereas invertase is found in HDSVs [ 38 ] . The snc1 ala43 mutant abolishes the fu - sion of vesicles with the plasma membrane and the deletion of PI 3 - kinase Vps34p dis - rupts the sorting of vacuolar hydrolases from endosomes to the vacuole . 6 These data demonstrate that if the formation of HDSVs is blocked , yeast cells are able to shift this cargo into LDSV , reflecting a distinct surface pathway [ 38 , 39 ] . These results furthermore suggest that in yeast at least two pathways to the surface exist and that some surface protein or secreted proteins reach the surface via an intermediate endosomal compartment . The biogenesis of HDSVs depends on the function of Vps1p and clathrin . This also implies that some exocytic cargo is transported along with vacuolar proteins before diverting to the surface . The experiments showing that invertase is sorted correctly in a vps34 ∆ mutant furthermore indicate that the biogenesis of HDSV is independent of protein sorting from endosomes to the vacuole . Although the formation of LDSVs cannot be blocked with known mutants involved in the Golgi - to - endosome pathway , this path - way must not be necessarily a direct pathway but instead might also transit via an en - dosomal compartment involving an unknown machinery . Interestingly , sec6 - 4 pep12 ∆ double mutants also efficiently block the HDSV formation [ 38 , 39 ] . This observation makes it very likely that HDSV cargo is sorted at the late endosome prior packaging into HDSVs . Thus , the late endosome represents an additional sorting station besides the Golgi ( Figure 2 ) . A caveat of these models is that pathways between the Golgi , the plasma membrane and the endosomal system might be interdependent and that the per - turbance of one route indirectly affects another one . Nonetheless , a remaining unsolved issue is whether HDSVs derive , similar to LDSVs at the Golgi , in a clathrin and Vps1p independent manner from late endosomes . Machineries for the sorting of exocytic cargo into and the formation of both , HDSV and LDSV , remains unknown . 7 Figure 2 Two populations of SVs , two branches of Golgi - to - surface transport In sec6 - 4 mutants at the restrictive temperature , two classes of vesicles can be isolated by density centrifu - gation . The high density secretory vesicles ( HDSV ) are positive for invertase and acid phosphatase activity . The light density secretory vesicles ( LDSV ) are positive for the major plasma membrane ATPase Pma1p and for the cell wall component Bgl2p . It has been shown that if transport to or from the endosomes is blocked by deletion of Vps1p ( yeast dynamin ) , Pep12p ( late endosome t - SNARE ) , Vps4p ( endosome - derived vesicle formation ) or mutants of clathrin ( chc1 - 521 ) , the formation of HDSVs is abolished and HDSV cargo is shifted into LDSVs ( dashed green arrow ) . These results led to the suggestion that a direct pathway ( LDSV ) and an indirect pathway , which would exit from the late endosome ( LDSV ) might exist in parallel . 1 . 1 . 3 Golgi exit routes of exocytic and vacuolar proteins As indicated above , exocytic cargo and vacuolar proteins can leave the Golgi on distinct routes . The transport routes of some exocytic and vacuolar proteins , which in this study serve as marker proteins , are characterized and discussed below ( Figure 3 ) . The secretion of the periplasmic enzyme invertase is blocked in all sec mutants [ 3 ] . Furthermore , invertase can be found in HDSVs isolated from sec6 - 4 mutant cells and is shifted into LDSV in double mutants of sec6 - 4 combined with vps1 ∆ or chc1 - 512 [ 38 , 39 ] . Since the transport to the endosomes depends on Vps1p and clathrin [ 36 , 37 ] , inver - 8 tase is likely to reach the surface via an endosomal compartment . In addition , sec6 - 4 pep12 ∆ double mutants also accumulate invertase in LDSV [ 38 , 39 ] . This suggests that invertase transits via the late endosome to the cell surface . Present data can , however , not determine whether invertase is transported directly from the Golgi to the late endosome or whether it reaches the late endosome from an early endosome . Pma1p , the major plasma membrane ATPase , requires association with a lipid - ordered phase also called rafts [ 42 ] . In contrast to invertase , Pma1p is found in LDSV [ 38 , 39 ] . This pathway is independent of Vps1p and , therefore , Pma1p is so far thought to follow a direct Golgi - to - plasma membrane route . Since the machinery involved in bud - ding of LDSVs from the trans - Golgi is unknown it could not be investigated yet whether Pma1p can be shifted to HDSV . In contrast to Pma1p , the general amino acid permease Gap1p is not associated with rafts / detergent resistant membranes ( DRMs ) [ 43 ] and is transcriptonally and post - translationally regulated by differential sorting in the late secretory pathway . Depending on the nitrogen source , Gap1p is transported to the cell surface or degraded in the vacuole [ 44 , 45 ] . Under poor nitrogen conditions ( e . g . proline ) Gap1p is expressed and trans - ported to the cell surface . If cells are then shifted to medium with a good nitrogen source ( e . g . glutamine ) , Gap1p is internalized and degraded in the vacuole . In addition , newly synthesized Gap1p is also routed towards the vacuole . Entry into the degradation pathway relies on ubiquitination of Gap1p . The monomeric clathrin adaptor proteins , Gga1p and Gga2p , bind to ubiquitinated Gap1p and this interaction is required for degradation of newly synthesized Gap1p [ 44 - 47 ] . However , the question whether the ubiquitination of Gap1p plays a role for sorting at the Golgi or at a later step on the late endosome is not solved at the moment . Harsay and Schekman raise the argument that proteins , which are only required under certain conditions ( secretion of invertase is regulated by low glucose conditions ) are sorted into HDSV and sorted at an endosome , whereas the direct transport to the surface of Pma1p is not triggered by any external stimulus [ 39 ] and , thus , follows a more general or default pathway . As described above , Gap1p localization and transport is highly regulated by the external nitrogen source . Thus , Gap1p might be a good candidate transmembrane protein packaged into HDSV that could transit through an endosomal compartment to the surface . However , it has to be noted that the actual exocytic route of 9 Gap1p has not been shown yet . As discussed above , HDSV formation is abolished in pep12 ∆ mutants and it might thus well be that in wild type cells , Gap1p is transported first to the late endosome and then sorted to surface by an unknown mechanism or , de - pending on its ubiquitantion , to the vacuole . Another protein with tightly regulated plasma membrane localization is chitin synthase III ( Chs3p ) . Chs3p is responsible for the synthesis of most of the chitin in the yeast cell wall [ 48 ] and required for cytokinesis . The protein localizes at the plasma membrane to the mother - bud junction [ 49 ] and to intracellular punctate structures called chitosomes . The chitosome is positive for the Golgi / early endosome marker Kex2p and is thus considered to be a specialized endosome [ 50 - 52 ] . Golgi exit and delivery of Chs3p to the cell surface is controlled by the action of Chs5p and Chs6p [ 50 , 53 ] . In addition , Chs3p transport is independent of late endosomes because in the class E vps mutant vps27 ∆ Chs3p organelles do not collapse into a class E compartment [ 54 ] . When daugh - ter cells reach full size , Chs3p is endocytosed and recycled for subsequent use in further rounds of cell division [ 49 , 52 ] . The current model is that Chs3p is stored in the chito - somes . When chitin synthesis is required , Chs3p is transported back from the chito - some / early endosome to the Golgi and from there transported in a polarized fashion to the mother - bud junction . This retrieval to the Golgi depends on adaptor protein complex AP - 1 , which is required for the formation of clathrin coated vesicles ( CCVs ) [ 54 ] . Another protein cycling within the Golgi endosomal system is the trans - Golgi protease Kex2p , which is required for the cleavage and processing of mating pheromone pro - α factor . kex2 ∆ mutants are unable to secrete killer toxin and are mating deficient ( only α cells ) [ 55 - 58 ] . Kex2p is transported to the late endosome at a relatively slow rate , from where it is retrieved back to the trans - Golgi . The retrieval step of Kex2p from this organelle is regulated by the retromer complex , a complex of Vps5p , Vps17p , Vps26p , Vps29p and Vps35p [ 59 ] . This slow delivery to the late endosome is thought to reflect transport via the early endosome to the late endosome [ 59 - 62 ] . The retrieval signal of Kex2p is located within the cytoplasmic tail of the protease [ 63 - 65 ] . In gga1 / 2 ∆ or vps1 ∆ cells , α factor is secreted in a highly glycosylated form , implicating defects in the local - ization / retrieval of Kex2p [ 66 , 67 ] . 10 The vacuolar hydrolase CPY is generated in a glycosylated form in the ER ( p1 form , 67kDa ) , transported to the Golgi , where it is processed to a higher glycosylated form ( p2 , 69kDa ) and then transits through the late endosome to the vacuole where CPY is cleaved by Pep4p to the mature form ( m form , 61kDa ) [ 68 ] . Efficient delivery of CPY to the vacuole requires its binding to the second lumenal domain of Vps10p , the sorting receptor for this hydrolase . Vps10p exclusively binds to the p2 form of CPY [ 69 , 70 ] . In cells lacking Vps10p , more than 90 % of CPY is secreted [ 69 ] . Upon delivery of CPY to the late endosome , Vps10p is retrieved back to the Golgi . The C - terminal tail of Vps10p plays a critical role in this process [ 71 ] . In contrast to Kex2p , the delivery of Vps10p to late endosomes is much more rapid , probably reflecting direct transport from the Golgi to the late endosome [ 60 , 66 , 72 ] . CPY accumulates in LDSV in sec6 - 4 vps1 ∆ cells , whereas in sec6 - 4 vps10 ∆ double mutants CPY is detected in HDSVs [ 39 ] . This demon - strates that CPY can enter HDSVs even in the absence of its sorting receptor , implicating a Vps10p independent sorting step for CPY . It might also suggest that Vps10p functions not only at the Golgi [ 69 , 73 ] but also at a later endosomal sorting step . In gga1 / 2 ∆ cells , CPY is secreted in the p2 form and in a pseudomature form [ 66 , 74 , 75 ] , although the lo - calization of Vps10p is normal [ 66 , 75 ] . However , delivery of CPY to the vacuole does not require AP - 1 [ 71 ] . Another TGN protein cycling between the late endosome and the Golgi is dipep - tidyl aminopeptidase A ( DPAP A ) . The delivery of DPAP A happens at a slow rate and seems to involve phopshoinositides [ 72 ] . The cytosolic domain of DPAP A , needed for interaction with the retromer complex and retrieval from endosomes [ 62 , 64 ] , has been fused to the transmembrane and lumenal domain of alkaline phospatase ( ALP ) to create the fusion protein A - ALP . This reporter protein transits through a compartment with proteolytic activity , indicated by the removal of its C - terminal propeptide [ 64 ] . The transport of A - ALP to the late endosome requires clathrin and the yeast synaptojanin - like protein Inp53p [ 72 , 76 ] , which is implicated in vesicle uncoating due to hydrolysis of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , a phosphoinositide known to bind to clathrin coat components [ 77 - 79 ] . The transport of A - ALP was severely disturbed in inp53 ∆ gga1 ∆ gga2 ∆ mutants but not in inp53 ∆ combined with an AP - 1 mutant ( inp53 ∆ apl2 ∆ ) [ 76 ] . From this , Ha et al . con - cluded that A - ALP transport is regulated by clathrin , Inp53p and AP - 1 . 11 Figure 3 Post - Golgi transport routes of established cargo . The major plasma membrane ATPase Pma1p has been show to be in LDSVs and invertase activity has been detected in HDSV that are formed depending on clathrin , Vps1p , Pep12p and proteins involved in the formation of endosome derived vesicles ( Vps4p ) but not on sorting into the degradation pathway ( Vps34p ) . It has been proposed that the secretion of HDSV cargo is tightly regulated and , although it has not been demonstrated yet , the general amino acid permease Gap1p might reach the surface by this route . The chitin synthase III ( Chs3p ) reaches the plasma membrane directly , and the Golgi exit of Chs3p is controlled by Chs5p and Chs6p . The retrieval from its internal stores ( ‘chitosomes’ ) to the Golgi depends on AP - 1 . The vacuolar hydrolase carboxypeptidase Y ( CPY ) binds to its sorting receptor Vps10p at the Golgi . Together , they are transported to the late endosome . CPY is released from Vps10p and delivered the vacuole whereas Vps10p is retrieved back to the Golgi . The protease Kex2p and the chimera A - ALP reach the late en - dosome with slow kinetics indicative of transit through early endosomes . A - ALP is delivered to the vacuole and Kex2p is retrieved back to the Golgi . 1 . 2 Phosphoinositide signaling All phosphorylated derivates of phosphatidylinositol ( PI ) are referred to as phosphoinosi - tides . In contrast to other phospholipid headgroups , the inositol ring of PI can be reversi - bly phosphorylated at positions 3’ , 4’ and / or 5’ . This leads to the formation of PI3P , PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 , PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 , PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , PI4P , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PI5P . In yeast , PI3P , PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 , PI4P and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 have so far been clearly detected . Recent reports in other yeast ( S . pombe ) 12 raise the possibility that also PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 might be present in S . cerevisiae [ 80 ] . These second messengers have been implicated in the regulation of growth , differ - entiation , cytoskeletal organization and membrane traffic ( reviewed in [ 81 - 83 ] ) . In recent years , different phosphoinositides have been shown to function as spatially restricted membrane signals , thus contributing to specificity in membrane transport . This concept is supported by the findings that the substrate ( phosphatidylinositol ) and the products ( phosphoinositides ) , as well as the modifying enzymes such as kinases and phosphatases are restricted to specific compartments and that structurally distinct phosphoinositides can recruit unique sets of effectors from the cytosol [ 84 ] ( Figure 4 ) . 1 . 2 . 1 Phosphatidylinositol 3 - phosphate in yeast membrane transport In a screen for mutants missorting vacuolar proteins , Vps34p and Vps15p were isolated [ 16 , 17 ] . VPS34 encodes for the only Phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase identified in yeast [ 85 ] . In order to function , Vps34p has to be recruited from the cytosol to the mem - brane and activated by the membrane associated Ser / Thr kinase Vps15p . In cells lacking Vps34p , Vps15p or carrying only kinase dead Vps15p , the levels of PI3P are drastically reduced [ 68 , 86 ] . Although Vps34p has been biochemically localized to Golgi and en - dosome enriched fractions [ 86 ] , it is believed that Vps34p preferentially acts at the early endosome and is not directly involved in exit / sorting from the Golgi . This is supported by the observation that , unlike vps1 ∆ mutants , vps34 ∆ cells produce both vesicle popula - tions , LDSVs and HDSVs [ 38 ] . Recruitment to membrane of PI3P binding proteins in mammals and yeast requires a conserved RING domain , called FYVE domain ( reviewed in [ 87 ] ) . A GFP - FYVE domain fusion protein exclusively localizes to the endosomes [ 88 - 91 ] , providing additional proof that Vps34p acts at the endosome and that PI3P is specific for the endosomal compartment . One of the FYVE domain containing proteins recruited by PI3P to endosomes is Vac1p , which is a structural homolog of mammalian EEA1 . Similar to EEA1 , Vac1p binds to PI3P and to Vps21p ( yeast Rab5 ) [ 92 - 94 ] . 13 1 . 2 . 2 Phosphatidylinositol ( 3 , 5 ) - bisphosphate in yeast membrane transport One of the effectors of PI3P is the FYVE domain containing protein Fab1p . Fab1p functions as PI3P 5 - kinase and converts PI3P to PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 [ 95 , 96 ] . Fab1p activity turns off PI3P signaling and initiates a new PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 signaling pathway . Perhaps , the conversion of PI3P abolishes further fusion of Golgi - derived vesicles with the endosome and induces , due to PI3 , 5P 2 signaling , the formation of multi vesicular bodies ( MVB ) . This represents an interesting example of the sequential action of phosphoinositides within cells . In contrast to Vps34p , Fab1p is not essential for membrane transport to the vacu - ole although fab1 ∆ mutant cells posses an increased vacuole with reduced catalytic activ - ity of vacuolar hydrolases due to defects in acidification of this compartment [ 95 ] . In yeast , activated G - coupled pheromone receptors are downregulated by sorting into MVBs , which , in turn , fuse with the vacuole , where their content is degraded by vacuolar hydrolases [ 97 ] . Membrane vesicles have been found in the lumen of vacuoles [ 98 ] . Sup - porting a role for Fab1p in the formation of MVB and / or fusion of endosomes with the vacuole , fab1 mutants show a reduced number of vesicles in the vacuole [ 95 ] and fab1 ∆ cells deliver their cargo to the limiting membrane of vacuoles [ 97 ] , explaining the in - creased vacuole and the defect in vacuolar homeostasis seen in mutants . The ENTH domain containg protein Ent3p and the ANTH domain containing protein Ent5p have been shown to localize to endosomal structures in a PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 depend - ent manner . Both proteins are required for sorting ubiquitinated cargo into MVBs [ 99 , 100 ] . Another yeast PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 effector is Svp1p , which seems to be involved in the re - trieval of excess membrane from the vacuole to the late endosome . Svp1p binds to PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 through its WD40 motif [ 101 ] . 1 . 2 . 3 Phosphatidylinositol ( 4 , 5 ) - bisphosphate in yeast membrane transport Although only 1 % of plasma membrane phospholipids is comprised of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , it is by far the most abundant phosphoinositide in the cell [ 102 ] . Mss4p is essential for 14 yeast viability and represents the only PI4P 5 - kinase so far identified in yeast [ 103 ] . Mss4p activity accounts for the major pool of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 at the plasma membrane as shown by localization of the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 specific PH domain ( GFP - 2xPH PLC δ ) to the plasma membrane [ 104 , 105 ] . The 5 - kinase itself localizes to the plasma membrane [ 106 ] and to the nucleus [ 107 ] . PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 homeostasis at the plasma membrane is not only regulated by lipid kinases but is also maintained by nucleo - cytoplasmic shuttling of Mss4p . Mss4p is stably associated with the plasma membrane upon phosphorylation by yeast casein kinase I Yck1 / 2p [ 107 ] . Dephosphorylation of Mss4p by an unknown phosphatase results into a transient nuclear transport of Mss4p . However , when Mss4p activity is required , Bcp1 , which is related to the mammalian BRCA2 - interacting protein BCCIP , mediates Mss4p export from the nucleus into the cytoplasm [ 107 ] . Due to the analysis of mutant pheno - types , Mss4p has been implicated in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton in cells during polarized growth [ 108 ] . Defects in fluid phase and receptor - mediated endocytosis at non - permissive temperature have also been reported for mss4 - 1 cells [ 108 ] . This might be explained by the requirement of a polarized actin cytoskeleton for endocytosis in yeast . Another possibility is that so far unknown proteins in yeast can bind to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and recruit the clathrin machinery to the site of endocytosis . It has been shown in the mammalian system that the protein AP - 180 binds directly to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 via its ENTH ( ep - sin amino terminal homology ) domain and also to clathrin [ 109 - 111 ] . The ENTH domain can be found in many proteins involved in endocytosis ( reviewed in [ 78 ] ) . Therefore , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 might serve as a site selection for endocytosis . In addition , the clathrin adaptor complex AP - 2 binds to clathrin and with a basic motif in the α subunit to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 [ 112 ] . Another indication for a role of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in endocytosis is that dynamin makes direct contact to the membrane through its PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding PH domain ( reviewed in [ 113 ] ) . However , it has to be noted that yeast dynamin Vps1p is not implicated in endocytosis and that yeast AP - 2 does not mediate clathrin regulated endocytosis [ 114 ] . The phosphoinositide phosphatases Inp52p and Inp53p are similar to the mam - malian synaptojanin and convert the plasma membrane pool of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 to PI4P [ 104 ] and , therefore , regulate the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 pool at the plasma membrane . Cells defective in the 5 - phosphate phosphatase Inp52p accumulate PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 also in intracellular , most likely endosomal compartments [ 104 ] . Mammalian synaptojanin and the hydrolysis of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 15 have been implicated in CCV uncoating during endocytosis [ 115 ] . Whether yeast Inp52p and Inp53p play a similar role in vesicle uncoating has still to be investigated . Although PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 has not been localized to the Golgi yet , Inp53p is implicated in slow delivery of the artificial marker protein A - ALP to the vacuole [ 76 ] . AP - 1 and not Gga1 / 2p controls this pathway [ 76 ] . It might also well be that the observed phenotypes in inp53 ∆ mutants are only a indirect result of disturbed endocytosis and subsequent disturbance of early endosomes . 1 . 2 . 4 Phosphatidylinositol 4 - phosphate in yeast membrane transport The yeast genome encodes for three PI 4 - kinases , LSB6 , STT4 and PIK1 [ 116 - 118 ] . Lsb6p and Stt4p localize to the plasma membrane [ 119 , 120 ] whereas Pik1p is re - cruited to the Golgi apparatus and to the nucleus [ 34 , 121 , 122 ] . In contrast to STT4 ( at least in most backgrounds ) and PIK1 , LSB6 is not essential for yeast growth . This means that no other PI 4 - kinase can substitute for Stt4p and Pik1p function . Since Lsb6p also localizes to the plasma membrane [ 119 ] , it is plausible that overexpression of LSB6 at least partially suppresses the growth defect of stt4 null mutants but not of pik1 null mutants [ 119 ] . An involvement of Lsb6p in membrane transport re - mains to be determined . Due to the distinct localization of Pik1p and Stt4p , the pools of PI4P remain func - tionally segregated . Stt4p localization to the plasma membrane is stabilized due to the interaction with the plasma membrane protein Sfk1p [ 120 ] . However , cells lacking Sfk1p are viable and events downstream of Stt4p are still functional [ 120 ] . Thus , the precise mechanism by which Stt4p is recruited to the plasma membrane is still elusive . The pool of PI4P produced by Stt4p acts as precursor for the production of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 by Mss4p [ 105 ] . Nevertheless , the plasma membrane pool of PI4P is not totally consumed by Mss4p since it can be visualized using a tandem of PH Osh2p domain fused to GFP [ 123 , 124 ] . This pool solely depends on Stt4p since it disappears in stt4 - 4 but not pik1 - 83 mu - tant cells . It has been shown that Stt4p is required for the regulation of Rho1p GTPase by binding and activation of Rom2p through its PH domain , which is required for the acti - 16 vation of the PKC pathway [ 120 ] . Furthermore , Stt4p has been implicated in actin cy - toskeleton organization and is required for maintaining cell wall integrity and vacuolar morphology [ 122 ] . Until now , no direct role for Stt4p in membrane traffic has been de - scribed although an indirect involvement via the actin cytoskeleton or the effects on the cell wall integrity cannot be excluded . Since Stt4p has been implicated in ER - to - Golgi aminophospholipid transport a probably minor pool of Stt4p is thought to be present in the ER [ 125 ] . Whether this ER pool of PI4P plays a role in exocytosis or at later steps , e . g . at the Golgi is still not understood . The role of PI4P is beyond being only a precursor for PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . For example , no PI4P 5 - kinase acting downstream of Pik1p has been identified . In addition , PH domains specific for PI4P localize to the Golgi [ 105 ] . Therefore , PI4P itself is the functional rele - vant phosphoinositide at the Golgi . This pool of PI4P is mainly produced by Pik1p , which localizes to the Golgi and the nucleus [ 34 , 121 , 122 ] . The function of Pik1p within the nucleus is not understood . It is also still elusive by which molecular mechanism Pik1p is recruited to the Golgi or transported to the nucleus . Pik1p contains two putative nuclear localization sequences . The only known physical interactor of Pik1p is the calmodulin - related calcium myristoyl switch protein frequenin - 1 ( Frq1p ) [ 126 , 127 ] . Frq1p positively regulates the activity of Pik1p in vitro and it is speculated that Frq1 myristoylation plays a role in the recruitment of Pik1p to the Golgi [ 126 ] . However , experimental proof for this proposed mechanism is still missing . The recruitment of PI4K β , the mammalian ortholog of Pik1p , to the Golgi depends on ARF1 as demonstrated by release of the kinase upon treatment with BFA . The molecular mechanism of this recruitment is still unknown . In addition , this interaction enhances the production of PI4P [ 128 ] . This raises the possibility that Arf1p plays a role in Pik1p recruitment to the Golgi in yeast . Moreo - ver , it has also been shown that pik1 mutant alleles are synthetic lethal with a deletion of ARF1 [ 34 , 129 ] . Another temperatur sensitive allele , pik1 - 83 , is only synthetic sick with a deletion of Arf1p but shows decreased levels of PI4P at the permissive temperature [ 122 ] . It could also be that , in analogy to the situation in mammalian cells , where the phosphati - dylinositol 3 - kinase is a Rab5 effector [ 130 ] , Pik1p might be recruited by a yeast Golgi Rab protein in its GTP - bound state . In contrast , it has been demonstrated for mammalian cells that PI4KIII β interaction with Rab11 - GTP is essential for the localization of Rab11 17 to the Golgi and subsequently for the regulation of exocytotic membrane transport [ 131 ] . Whether such mechanisms exist for Pik1p in yeast is unknown . It has been shown that pik1 - 101 is synthetic lethal with mutants of most late - acting sec - genes and in combination with mutant alleles of cytoskeletal proteins ( act1 - 2 , myo2 - 66 ) [ 34 ] . Furthermore , pik1 mutant cells ( pik1 - 101 and pik1 - 83 ) are defective in the transport of the periplasmic protein invertase , show a delay in the maturation of CPY and exhibit an unpolarized actin cytoskeleton , exaggerated Golgi membranes ( Berkeley Bod - ies ) and defects in cytokinesis [ 34 , 121 , 122 , 132 ] . These phenotypes result from a re - duced catalytic activity of both pik1 mutant alleles at the restrictive temperature [ 34 , 122 ] . In addition , FM4 - 64 uptake is blocked at endosomes in pik1 - 101 cells [ 34 ] . Thus , Pik1p and its product PI4P are involved in membrane transport from the Golgi and in maintainance of Golgi morphology . The effect on the FM4 - 64 uptake might be indirect since disturbing exit from the Golgi most certainly will also affect downstream compart - ments of the endosomal system . Until now , also a direct role of Pik1p / PI4P at the en - dosomes cannot be ruled out . Another indication that PI4P is important for exit from the Golgi derives from studies on the PI4P 4 - phosphatase Sac1p . Cells lacking SAC1 display an increased anterograde transport of chitin synthase III ( Chs3p ) . The same effect has been observed in cells overexpressing PIK1 [ 133 ] . Further confirmation of the importance of PI4P in Golgi - to - plasma membrane transport is that sac1 mutants bypass sec14 mutants [ 134 ] . Sec14p is the main phosphati - dylinositol transfer protein ( PITP ) in yeast and is required for Golgi - to - plasma membrane transport [ 3 , 29 , 30 , 135 ] . Double mutants of sec14 - 3 and sac1 - 22 contain tenfold more PI4P than either single mutant and sec14 - 3 mutants produce less PI4P than wild type cells at the restrictive temperature [ 132 ] . Moreover , overproduction of PIK1 also partially suppresses the sec14 - 3 growth defect [ 132 ] . However , it is worth noticing that sac1 ∆ cells have more phenotypes than only the bypass of the Sec14p requirement and that the accumulation of PI4P in sac1 ∆ cells alone cannot explain the Sec14p bypass ( reviewed in [ 136 ] ) . By performing a genome wide synthetic lethal screen for Pik1p ( pik1 - 139 ) , pro - teins involved in the transport to the vacuole , in intra - Golgi , Golgi - to - plasma membrane and retrograde endosome - to - Golgi or Golgi - to - ER have been isolated [ 129 ] . Among these 18 proteins were components of the TRAPP II complex ( kre11 ∆ , trs33 ∆ ) [ 137 ] , proteins in - volved in the formation of clathrin coated exocytic vesicles ( drs2 ∆ ) [ 46 , 138 ] and pro - teins involved in the formation of vesicles at the Golgi ( ypt31 ∆ ) [ 31 , 32 ] . Nevertheless , this screen failed to identify coat components or proteins containing PI4P binding mod - ules ( e . g . PH domain ) and , therefore , it is unclear whether true effectors of PI4P have been isolated . However , the authors suggest that PI4P is required for transport between Golgi and the endosomal system . Figure 4 Subcellular distribution of phosphoinositides in yeast PI3P is mainly localized to early endosomes . At late endosomes / MVBs , PI3P is converted to PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 . The most abundant phosphoinositide at the Golgi is PI4P . The PI4P produced at the plasma membrane serves mostly as precursor for the formation of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . Despite that lack of direct evidence , PI4P is also thought to be present at the ER . The responsible kinases are color coded in the same way as the phosphoi - nositide they are producing . The assumed site of action for the phosphoinositide phosphatases Sac1p and Inp52 / 53p is indicated by black arrows . 19 1 . 2 . 5 Phosphoinositide binding modules Phosphoinositides in membrane transport function in the recruitment of proteins to specific sites within the cell . They are ideal membrane second messengers because they are spatially and temporally restricted and the synthesis from the abundant precursor PI can be very rapid , leading to an enrichment of specific phosphoinositides in membrane microdomains . Due to a high ratio between phosphoinositides to binding protein , many proteins can be targeted to membranes without saturating the binding sites . In addition , the different phospho - derivates of PI activate specific downstream events ( reviewed in [ 87 ] ) . The interaction of proteins with phosphoinositides is mediated by highly conserved modular protein domains , is of low affinity and rapidly reversible . This leads to a cycle of diffusion within the cytoplasm , fast recruitment to membranes and subsequent release to the cytoplasm [ 139 ] . Up to date , the epsin amino - terminal homology ( ENTH ) domain , the AP180 N - terminal homology ( ANTH ) domain , the Fab1 , YOTB , Vac1 and EEA1 ( FYVE ) domain , the band 4 . 1 , ezrin , radixin and moesin ( FERM ) domain , the Tubby domain , the phox homology ( PX ) domain and the pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domain have been identified [ 87 , 91 , 102 ] . The PX domain was identified as a 130 aa homology region in two components of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase ( phox ) complex [ 140 ] . PX domain containing proteins have an assigned function in vesicular traffic , protein sorting or lipid modification [ 141 - 146 ] . In the yeast genome , 15 PX domain containing proteins have been identified , and all bind to PI3P [ 146 ] . The interaction with the headgroup of PI3P is not enough for membrane recruitment but penetration of the membrane might play a role in increasing the affinity of PX domains binding to PI3P [ 102 ] . The FYVE domain was identified as a 60 - 70 aa domain and named for the 4 pro - teins it was first discovered in : Fab1 , YOTB , Vac1 and EEA1 [ 147 ] . This domain is able to bind directly and selectively to PI3P in vivo and in vitro and is implicated in endoso - mal membrane transport steps [ 98 , 148 , 149 ] . The FYVE domain contains two β - hairpins and a small α - helix that are held together by two Zn 2 + binding clusters in a zinc finger like motif . A basic motif within the first β - hairpin creates a shallow positively charged 20 pocket . Side chains of the basic motif form hydrogen bonds to phosphates of the PI3P headgroup and to the 4 - , 5 - and 6 - hydroxyls of the inositol ring . Additional 4 - or 5 - phosphate would disrupt hydroxyl group hydrogen bonding and cause steric problems . Therefore , FYVE domains are specific for PI3P [ 150 ] . The same argument is valid for the specificity of PX domains [ 151 ] . Binding to the headgroup of PI3P is not enough for membrane recruitment . First , PI3P is not very abundant in the membrane and , second , binding to the PI3P headgroup is very weak [ 150 ] . By analyzing the structure , it has be - come clear that FYVE domains penetrate the membrane . This bases on the insertion of a non - polar side chain of the membrane interacting loop into the membrane [ 152 - 154 ] . However , even this dual mechanism , interacting with the headgroup and penetrating the membrane , seems to be not enough for membrane recruitment of FYVE domains . Single FYVE domains fused to GFP show no membrane labeling but a dimer of the FYVE do - main fused to GFP is localized to endosomes [ 89 ] . Therefore , it seems likely that dimeri - zation / oligomerization plays a crucial role in membrane binding . A variety of experiments has shown that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 plays a important role in the initial steps of endocytosis [ 155 ] . For example , the α - subunit of AP - 2 is able to interact via a N - terminal 80 aa region with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and by this means recruits the AP - 2 complex to the plasma membrane [ 112 , 156 ] . The N - terminal part of α - subunit comprises a α - helical solenoid structure , which binds inositol phosphates on its surface rather than forming a binding pocket . That might also be the reason for the weak and relative pro - miscuous interaction [ 157 ] . The AP180 protein has been show to bind to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and to clathrin . In fact , the recruitment of clathrin to the site of endocytosis can be reconstituted in vitro using PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 liposomes , purified AP180 and clathrin [ 109 , 110 ] . The N - terminal part of AP180 resembles the N - terminal part of α - subunit of AP - 2 , also forming a α - helical solenoid structure and sharing the ability to bind PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 [ 109 ] . This struc - ture has been named AP180 N - terminal homology ( ANTH ) domain [ 109 ] . As for the subunit of AP - 2 , the ANTH binds weakly to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 [ 157 ] . However , since PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is highly abundant in the plasma membrane it most likely is the physiological ligand of the ANTH domain . Epsin binds to the α - subunit of AP - 2 and its epsin N - terminal homology ( ENTH ) domain [ 111 ] also forms a α - helical superhelical solenoid structure , which binds 10 times 21 stronger to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 than ANTH domains and targets independently to the plasma mem - brane [ 110 ] . In in vitro assays , purified ENTH domains induce the tubulation of liposomes , penetrate the membrane surface and alter the curvature of membranes [ 109 ] . It has been shown that upon binding to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , an additional amphiphatic helix is ex - posed which most likely penetrates the membrane . This membrane penetration is required for the induction of membrane curvature [ 158 ] . In contrast to epsin , epsinR has been shown to interact with AP - 1 / clathrin and the epsinR ENTH domain weakly prefers PI4P over PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in vitro [ 159 , 160 ] . Proteins containing a pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domain are involved in signaling , rearrangement of the cytoskeleton , membrane transport and modification of phospholip - ids [ 113 ] . Since the PH domain itself lacks any catalytic activity and is often identified in proteins tied to membranes it is thought that PH domains function as membrane adaptors or tethering domains , linking proteins to membranes [ 161 ] . The around 120 aa long PH domain has first been recognized as a special motif that interacts strongly with PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 and , thereby , recruits proteins to the plasma membrane [ 162 ] . However , in a screen for new PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 binding PH domains , PH domains with specificity in vitro for PI3P , PI4P and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 were identified [ 163 ] . PH domains lack any primary sequence similarity [ 164 ] but share a common three - dimensional structure . This core structure con - sists of a pair of nearly orthogonal β - sheets of four and three antiparallel strands resem - bling a collapsed β - barrel . The N - and C - termini are located on the same side but protrude in opposite directions . The characteristic C - terminal α - helix packs against one edge of the β - sheet structure , stabilizing the fold [ 162 , 165 ] . In addition , PH domains are electro - statically polarized , the positively charged face overlapping with the phosphoinositide binding site [ 162 ] . The binding of phosphoinositides occurs in a binding pocket via mul - tiple hygrogen bonds to each phosphate in the headgroup [ 166 ] . The amount of hydrogen bonds made between the PH domain and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 or PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 headgroup are strong enough to recruit the PH domain to the membrane [ 167 ] without the necessity of a membrane penetration through an amphiphatic helix as seen in FYVE or PX do - mains . Until now , PH domains are the only established PI4P binding modules . However , the binding of PH domains to PI4P is relatively weak since only a small number of hy - drogen bonds can be formed . Apparently , the recruitment of PI4P specific PH domains to 22 Golgi membranes requires PI4P and functional Arf1p . This has been shown in both , the yeast and the mammalian system [ 105 , 168 ] . Whether the PH domain binds to Arf1 itself or to a factor recruited by Arf1 to the membrane is unknown . The yeast genome encodes for 33 PH containing proteins as identified by SMART database search [ 169 ] . In vitro studies of the binding specificities of the isolated PH do - mains revealed that one is specific for PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( PH Num1p ) , four are specific for PI3P ( PH Bud4p , PHSpo71p ( N ) , PH Spo71p ( C ) , PH Yrl187wp ) , 22 PH domains bind to all phosphoinositides tested and six PH domains show no binding to phosphoinositides at all [ 170 ] . When these PH domains were fused to eGFP , 21 showed a diffuse cytoplasmic labeling , 6 localized to the plasma membrane in yeast ( PH Cla4p , PH Num1p , PH Opy1 ( C ) , PH Skm1p , PH Yil105cp , PH Ynl047cp ) and HeLa cells and the PH domains of Osh1p and Osh2p localized to the Golgi [ 170 ] . In addition , in a large - scale study , in which the full - lenght protein fused to GFP were local - ized , only four PH domain - containing proteins were significantly localized to membranes [ 171 ] . An interesting outcome of the localization of yeast PH domains is that similar de - grees of membrane localization can be seen for PH domains with different phosphoinosi - tide binding affinities in vitro and that different localization can be observed for PH do - mains with similar phosphoinositide binding specificities [ 170 ] . This suggests that bind - ing to phosphoinositides facilitates membrane targeting of most PH domains but it does not specify their subcellular location . This further implicates , as mentioned above , that simultaneous binding to additional factors is required for the localization to distinct membranes [ 105 , 168 ] . phosphoinositide domain membrane PI3P PI ( 3 , 4 , ) P 2 PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 3 PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 PI4P PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 FYVE , PX PH , tubby non identified PH , tubby PH , ENTH PH , FERM , tubby , ENTH , ANTH endosome PM - PM Golgi PM Table 1 Specificities of phosphoinositide binding motifs ( reviewed in [ 102 ] ) Phosphoinositides bind to specific binding modules with distinct specificities . These specificities reflect the distinct site of membrane recruitment . PM = plasma membrane 23 1 . 2 . 6 PI4P effectors Although many proteins are known that bind to PI3P or PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and that are in - volved in endocytosis or transport to the vacuole / lysosome , only a few proteins have been shown to bind to PI4P or require PI4P for membrane localization [ 78 , 84 , 136 , 172 ] . The PH domains of the mammalian oxysterol binding proteins OSBP and GPBP localize to the Golgi in yeast and mammalian cells . In both systems , PI4P and functional Arf1 are required for membrane targeting of these domains . Golgi localization conferring PI4P is produced by Pik1p in yeast or its mammalian homolog PI4K β in mammalian cells [ 105 , 168 ] . In a screen for PH domains binding to PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , PH FAPP1 was isolated . Surpris - ingly , PH FAPP1 has a strong preference for PI4P in vitro [ 163 ] . There are several lines of evidence that PI4P activity and ARF activity is required for Golgi localization of full length FAPP1 and FAPP2 . Firstly , FAPP1 / 2 localizes to the cytoplasm in kinase dead mutants of PI4K β . Secondly , upon treatment with BFA , FAPP1 / 2 redistributes from the Golgi to the cytosol [ 168 ] . Thirdly , the localization to the Golgi is dependent on the PH domain of FAPP1 / 2 and the overexpression of PH FAPP can displace endogenous FAPP1 / 2 from the Golgi into the cytosol . In addition , ARF1 - GTP γ S can be pulled down from cyto - sol using GST - PH FAPP [ 168 ] . Interestingly , PH FAPP ( and also PH OSBP ) increases the binding of ARF - GTP to membranes by inhibiting the recruitment and the activity of ARF - GTPase activating protein ( ARF - GAP ) . This suggests that upon FAPP1 / 2 binding , ARF - GTP is stabilized at the Golgi membrane [ 168 ] . The exact function of FAPP1 / 2 is still unclear but it has been shown that cells treated with FAPP specific siRNAs are defective in delivery of the viral marker protein ts0450VSV - G and glucosaminoglycans from the Golgi to the plasma membrane but had no effect on transport of Lamp proteins to the lysosome or of mannose 6 - phosphate receptors through endosomes [ 168 ] . If VSV - G transport is inhibited by release of endogenous FAPP1 / 2 due to overexpression of PH FAPP , long VSV - G positive tubules extend from the Golgi . Furthermore , the number of trans - port carriers is drastically reduced in these cells . This data might indicate that FAPP1 / 2 are involved in fission at the Golgi [ 168 ] . The obtained results led to the proposal that FAPPs either might be new coats involved in the formation of transport carriers specific 24 for Golgi - to - plasma membrane transport [ 168 , 173 ] or that FAPPs might play a role in the organization of membrane microdomains . However , whether FAPP proteins really are coats for TGN derived vesicles needs to be determinend . It remains to be shown that FAPPs associate with transport carriers . In mammalian cells , PI4KIII α , PI4KIII β and PI4KII α , the orthologs of yeast Stt4p , Pik1p and Lsb6p respectively , localize to the Golgi apparatus [ 174 , 175 ] . The synthesis of PI4P by PI4III β is regulated by an unknown mechanism involving ARF1 [ 128 ] . Although ARF1 also recruits the PI4P 5 - kinases , remarkably little PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 can be found at the Golgi [ 128 ] . The transport of CCVs from the Golgi to endosomes is medi - ated by the tetrameric clathrin adaptor complex AP - 1 [ 176 ] . AP - 2 , another adaptor com - plex involved in endocytosis , has been shown to bind to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 directly through its α - subunit [ 112 , 156 ] . In contrast to AP - 2 , AP - 1 localization to the Golgi depends on PI4KII α . In in vitro assays , purified AP - 1 binds with higher affinity to PI4P than to PI5P or PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 but not at all to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . PI4KII α RNAi blocks AP - 1 association with the Golgi ( TGN ) and , as a consequence , blocks the Golgi association of clathrin . In addition , PI4KII α RNAi inhibits export of VSV - G and HA from the Golgi in HeLa cells . How - ever , this defect appears to be more indirect since it can be rescued by PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 shuttled into the cells [ 175 ] . Similar to the FAPPs , AP - 1 recruitment to the Golgi depends also on ARF1 [ 177 , 178 ] . Another PI4P effector , EpsinR , was found in a database search for additional ep - sin proteins in mammalian cells . It is more distantly related to epsin 1 - 3 and therefore called epsin related protein ( EpsinR ) [ 179 ] . The ENTH domain of epsinR is conserved but the lipid specificity is predicted to be different from the epsin ENTH domain [ 179 ] . In in vitro assays , epsinR weakly prefers PI4P [ 159 , 160 ] . The isolated epsinR ENTH do - main is able to localize to the Golgi [ 159 ] and mutations in the ENTH domain altered subcellular localization . However , the mutated form of the epsinR is not totally mislo - calized to the cytosol [ 160 ] . EpsinR has been shown to bind in vivo and in vitro to AP - 1 and to GGA1 and GGA2 [ 159 , 160 ] . Moreover , EpsinR and AP - 1 ( γ - subunit ) and to a lower degree epsinR and GGAs colocalize by immunofluorescence microscopy [ 159 ] In addition , epsinR is enriched in CCVs [ 159 ] . Recently , EpsinR has been implicated in budding from the Golgi by facilitating membrane curvature during CCV formation [ 160 ] . 25 Nevertheless , it has to be noted that the identity of the PI 4 - kinase generating PI4P for EpsinR recruitment is still unsolved . The colocalization of epsinR with AP - 1 raises the possibility that PI4P required for epsinR localization is also produced by PI4KII α [ 175 ] . In a search for new proteins involved in the transport of ceramides , a new PI4P binding protein in mammalian cells has been identified . Ceramide , which is produced in the ER , is transported to the Golgi for conversion into sphingomyelin . When exposed to the cholesterol absorbing agent methyl - β - cyclo - dextrin , sphingomyelin deficient cells lose their cellular cholesterol and die faster than wild type cells . CERT was identified in a screen for methyl - β - cyclodextrin revertants in sphingomyelin deficient cells [ 180 ] and Human CERT is similar to GPBP ∆ 26 , a splicing variant of Goodpasture antigen - binding protein ( GPBP ) . It has a PH domain and a putative lipid transfer catalyzing domain called START . The PH CERT domain associates full length CERT with the Golgi [ 105 , 180 ] , and the START domain is required for the extraction of ceramides from the ER [ 180 ] . There - fore , CERT has been implicated in the non - vesicular traffic of ceramides from the ER to the Golgi [ 180 ] . The yeast genome encodes for 7 oxysterol binding proteins ( OSBP ) called Osh1 - 7 . The molecular function of the yeast OSBPs is not understood but it has been shown that they share redundant functions [ 181 , 182 ] and that they are involved in maintaining the cellular sterol lipid composition [ 181 ] . Only the deletion of all OSH genes leads to inviability [ 181 ] . The depletion of all Osh proteins ( osh1 / 2 / 3 / 5 / 6 / 7 ∆ osh4 ts ) leads to only minor defects in CPY maturation , has no effect on Gas1p ( GPI - anchored protein , re - quired for cell wall assembly ) and Hsp150p ( secreted heat - shock protein required for cell wall stability ) transport to the plasma membrane but shows defects in endocytosis [ 183 ] . The Osh1 and Osh2 full - length proteins have been localized to the Golgi in dependence of PI4P produced by Pik1p . A structural requirement for this localization is their PH do - main [ 124 , 170 , 171 ] . Osh4p / Kes1p plays a particular role because the deletion of KES1 suppresses a sec14 - 3 mutant ; an effect that cannot be reversed by overexpression of any other Osh protein [ 181 ] . It also possesses an unconventional PH domain and localizes , in dependence on PI4P , to the Golgi [ 184 ] . In pik1 - 101 mutants , Kes1 - GFP is released into the cytosol [ 184 ] . It has furthermore been shown that deletion of KES1 improves the growth of pik1 - 101 mutants [ 184 ] . Because of these results it was suggested that Kes1p is 26 an inhibitor of Pik1p and a negative regulator of Pik1p - driven membrane traffic . It has also be mentioned that pik1 - 101 phenotypes do not resemble phenotypes seen in Osh protein depleted cells and , therefore , more PI4P binding proteins involved in Golgi func - tion have to exist in yeast . Figure 5 PI4P binding proteins Depletion of PI4KII α by RNAi leads to the release of AP - 1 from the Golgi . In addition , AP - 1 binds PI4P in vitro . It has also been show that epsinR preferentially binds to PI4P in vitro . Since epsinR binds to the γ - appendage of AP - 1 it raises the possibility that PI4KII α is also responsible for Golgi recruitment in vivo . The ceramide transporter CERT has been shown to bind to PI4P in vitro through its PH domain . FAPP proteins bind to PI4P in vivo and in vitro , and this interaction depends on a functional PH domain , PI4KIII β and Arf - GTP . PH OSBP and PH FAPP are recruited to the Golgi in yeast . This localization depends on Arf1 and Pik1p . The only known yeast proteins interacting with PI4P are Osh1p , Osh2p and Osh4p / Kes1p . All three yeast proteins contain PH domains . * indicates in vitro data only . 1 . 3 Post Golgi vesicle formation 1 . 3 . 1 Drs2p Initial indication that Drs2p is involved in post - Golgi transport comes from ob - served genetic interactions with arf1 ∆ and chc1 [ 185 ] . Yeast Drs2p ( or Swa3p ) is the founding member of a distinct subfamily of P - type ATPases with putative aminophos - 27 pholipid translocase ( flippase ) activity . Besides Drs2p , Dnf1p , Dnf2p , Dnf3p and Neo1p belong to this family [ 186 - 188 ] . Drs2p and Dnf3p localize to the Golgi whereas Dnf1 and Dnf2p have been found at the plasma membrane and on internal membranes ( Golgi , en - dosomes ) [ 185 , 189 , 190 ] . It has been shown that Drs2p can flip NBD - phosphatidylserine ( NBD - PS ) and NBD - phosphaditylethanolamine ( NBD - PE ) from the lumenal leaflet to the cytosolic leaflet of the Golgi [ 191 ] . Interestingly , loss of Drs2p depletes the plasma membrane of Dnf1p and Dnf2p . This indicates that Drs2p is involved in exocytotic trans - port and that Dnf1 / 2p reaches the plasma membrane through vesicular transport [ 138 , 190 , 192 ] . Furthermore , drs2 mutants missort Kex2p to the plasma membrane and have a defect in CPY maturation similar to the defect seen in arf1 ∆ cells . Mechanistically , phos - pholipid translocation by Drs2p is thought to function in the formation of CCVs at the Golgi because temperature sensitive drs2 mutants are unable to translocate NBD - PS and do not form HDSV at the restricted temperature , and an ATPase dead mutant blocks the formation of HDSV as well [ 138 , 185 , 190 ] . However , PS - deficient cells also require Drs2p for the HDSV formation and , therefore , PS is not the obligatory substrate for Drs2p function in CCV formation and PE is an obvious candidate substrate for Drs2p [ 191 ] . As an alternative mechanism to phospholipid translocation , a conformational change accompanying ATP hydrolysis might regulate protein - protein interactions rele - vant for vesicle formation . In the context of such a model it is of interest that the C - terminal tail of Drs2p interacts with the Arf1 - GEF Gea2p and although this interaction is not essential for Drs2p function it might contribute to the concentration of the budding machinery ( Arf1 , adaptors and clathrin ) to budding sites at the Golgi [ 193 ] . But how does the flipping of phospholipids effect the vesicle formation ? Changes in the surface area of one leaflet relative to the other would induce conformational changes in the bilayer . To be more specific , phospholipid translocation from the lumenal to the cytosolic leaflet of the Golgi would lead to an increase in the surface area of the cytosolic leaflet and , subsequently , bending of the membrane and induction of a positive curvature , thus , facilitating the generation of tightly curved vesicles [ 194 ] . As an extreme consequence that might lead to the consumption of the trans - Golgi into CCVs . This sce - nario is in agreement with the cisternal maturation model [ 195 ] . Drs2p might induce positive curvature at the Golgi and by this means create a platform for coat proteins 28 forming vesicles . In addition , due to the interaction with the Arf1 GEF Gea2p , Drs2p might recruit Arf1 to the membrane . Arf1is required for the formation of CCVs at the plasma membrane . Furthermore , high concentrations of PE can facilitate the assembly of clathrin - coated buds on liposomes ( reviewed in [ 196 ] ) . 1 . 3 . 2 AP - 1 ( assembly protein or adaptor protein ) in yeast and mammalian cells AP - 1 is a tetrameric adaptor complex , which mediates cargo selection in the late secretory and endocytic pathway in association with clathrin . It consists of two large subunits ( a . k . a . adaptins ) , γ and β 1 , one medium subunit called µ 1 and one small subunit named δ 1 . The β 1 - subunit binds through the clathrin box motif in the hinge region to clathrin [ 197 ] but the hinge and ear region of γ - adaptin are also able to interact with clathrin [ 198 ] . The function of the γ - ear is the recruitment of additional factors to the site of coat formation [ 75 , 199 , 200 ] and the µ - subunit has been implicated in cargo selection and recruitment . The recognized tyrosine related sorting motif is usually found in the cy - toplasmic tail of transmembrane proteins [ 201 , 202 ] . Another sorting motif , a di - leucine motif with the [ D / E ] XXXL [ L / I ] consensus sequence , is not recognized by the µ - subunit but by the γ and δ 1 - subunits [ 203 ] . In addition , the di - leucine motif with the consensus sequence DXXLL is not bound by AP - 1 , but binds to GGA proteins [ 204 , 205 ] . Figure 6 Schematic diagram of AP - 1 AP1 is a tetrameric adaptor complex consisting of four subunits : the two large subunits γ and β 1 , a medium - sized subunit δ 1 and the small µ 1 - subunit . The γ - ear recruits accessory proteins , the µ - subunits interacts with tyrosine - related sorting motifs within cargo tails . The function of the β - subunit is the interaction with clathrin . The AP - 1 complex localizes to the trans - Golgi in mammals and yeast . Although there is not much known about the precise recruitment mechanism of AP - 1 to the Golgi , 29 it has been shown that activated ARF - GTP and , at least in the mammalian system , PI4P are required for Golgi association [ 175 , 206 - 210 ] . Several lines of evidence indicated that AP - 1 containing CCVs are involved in anterograde transport from the Golgi to endosomes and the best - studied example is the transport of mannose - 6 - phosphate receptor ( M6PR ) from the Golgi to endosomes [ 211 - 215 ] . If AP - 1 mediates anterograde transport of M6PR from the Golgi it is expected that AP - 1 deficient cells accumulate M6PR in the Golgi . Interestingly , µ 1 knockout mice , which do not assemble AP - 1 , transport M6PR to the plasma membrane where it is endo - cytosed and then accumulates in EEA1 positive early endosomes [ 216 ] . This indicates a function in the retrograde rather than the anterograde pathway from the endosome to the Golgi . In addition , yeast AP - 1 has also been implicated in retrieval of Chs3p from the early endosome to the Golgi [ 54 ] . This furthermore supports the idea that AP - 1 has a function in retrograde transport . In addition , genetic experiments in yeast challenged the accepted view that AP - 1 is required for the formation of CCVs at the Golgi . Firstly , the deletion of the yeast β 1 - subunit ( apl2 ∆ ) has no phenotype . In contrast , clathrin mutants show defects in vesicular transport [ 217 ] . Secondly , the deletion of all AP - subunits does not cause a clathrin mutant like phenotype and has actually no effect on CCV formation at all . Additional deletion of accessory proteins ( yeast AP180 ) also did not disturb CCV formation [ 114 ] . That might indicate an important role for other adaptor proteins ( e . g . yeast Gga proteins ) in linking clathrin to cargo proteins . 1 . 3 . 3 GGA ( Golgi localized , γ - ear containing , Arf binding ) proteins in yeast and mammalian cells There are three GGA proteins ( GGA1 , GGA2 , GGA3 ) in humans and two in yeast ( Gga1p , Gga2p ) . GGAs function as monomeric clathrin adaptors and localize , similar to AP - 1 , to the Golgi and to endosomes . In yeast , Gga proteins are found on CCVs but in mammalian Gga proteins rather rapidly dissociate into the cytosol where they stay monomeric . Until now , it is controversial whether GGA proteins and AP - 1 function se - quentially or in parallel membrane traffic pathways [ 54 , 66 , 75 , 176 , 216 , 218 , 219 ] . 30 The most striking feature of GGA proteins is a conserved modular organization . GGAs contain a VHS ( Vps27 , Hrs , Stam ) domain , a GAT ( GGA and TOM ) domain , a hinge region and a GAE ( γ - adaptin ear ) domain [ 220 ] . Figure 7 Schematic domain structure of GGA proteins GGA proteins are monomeric adaptor proteins . GGA proteins have a N - terminal VHS ( Vps27 , Hrs , Stam ) domain , a GAT ( GGA and TOM ) domain , a hinge region and a GAE ( γ - adaptin ear ) domain . The VHS domain binds to cargo recognition sequences with the consensus sequence DXXLL . The GAT domain me - diates the interaction with ARF - GTP and ubiquitin . The hinge domain has a clathrin binding box motif and the GAE domain is able to bind to accessory proteins . The VHS domain of mammalian GGAs interacts with the acidic di - leucine motif ( DXXLL ) within the cytoplasmic tail of cargo proteins [ 204 , 221 , 222 ] . It has to be men - tioned that the interacting residues within the VHS domain are not conserved between mammalian and yeast GGAs . In addition , so far investigated yeast transmembrane pro - teins ( Vps10p , Pep12p , Kex2p ) do not have the DXXLL motif in their cytoplasmic do - main [ 223 ] . That might indicate that yeast GGA proteins recognize a different sorting signal . Nevertheless , the general amino acid permease Gap1 , which is Gga dependent sorted from the Golgi to the vacuole , contains a DXXLL di - leucine motif . Gap1p , in which the di - leucine motif is changed to DXXAA , is not degraded in the vacuole [ 224 ] . The GAT domain binds to ARF - GTP [ 225 ] and also to ubiquitin [ 47 , 226 ] . In the mam - malian system , GGA binding to ARF - GTP is required and sufficient to recruit the pro - teins to Golgi membranes [ 225 ] . That seems not to be the case in yeast , where the VHS and GAE domain have been shown to cooperate with the GAT domain to direct GGA localization to the Golgi [ 227 ] . Nevertheless , yeast GGAs also interact with Arf1p - GTP [ 228 ] . Arf1 and ubiquitin can bind simultaneously to GGA proteins and ARF binding to GGAs activates ubiquitin binding , which is very weak in full - length GGA proteins [ 47 , 229 ] . This provides a mechanism by which ubiquitinated cargo is sorted into CCVs and transported from the Golgi to endosomes . In yeast , it is well known that GGA proteins are involved in transport from the Golgi into the endosomal system [ 41 ] and that ubiq - 31 uitination of , for example Gap1p , is important for entry into the degradative pathway [ 45 ] . Cells expressing GGA proteins lacking the ubiquitin - binding motif in the GAT do - main do not divert Gap1p to the vacuole anymore but rather transport it to the cell surface [ 47 ] . Nonetheless , it has so far not been shown whether GGA proteins are involved in transport of exocytic cargo through endosomes . It might well be that the key sorting deci - sion is made at an endosomal compartment . The hinge region of GGA proteins mediates the interaction with clathrin [ 66 , 67 , 230 ] and the GAE domain interacts with accessory proteins such as ENTH domain proteins ( epsinR in mammalian cells , Ent3p and Ent5p in yeast ) [ 159 , 160 , 231 ] . In yeast , phenotypic analysis of gga1 / 2 ∆ cells indicates an involvement in a Golgi - to - endosome pathway . The vacuolar hydrolase CPY is missorted to the plasma membrane in its Golgi or a pseudo - mature form in gga1 / 2 ∆ cells . Delivery of another vacuolar hydrolase ( CPS ) to the vacuole is delayed [ 74 , 75 , 225 ] . Furthermore , in gga1 / 2 ∆ cells , 60 % of α - factor is secreted in an aberrant , highly glycosylated form . The secretion of mature α - factor depends on cleavage by the protease Kex2p , indicating a de - fect in Kex2 localization in gga1 / 2 ∆ cells [ 66 ] . Deletion of GGA1 / 2 also results in mis - sorting of the late endosomal t - SNARE Pep12p to early endosomes [ 41 ] leading to the proposal that Gga1 / 2p are involved in transport to the late endosomes , whereas AP - 1 is involved in traffic between Golgi and early endosomes [ 41 ] . Support for this hypothesis comes from genetic studies showing that the combined deletion of GGA1 / 2 and APL2 ( AP - 1 , β 1 - subunit ) had more severe effects on growth , CPS and A - ALP processing and α - factor secretion than deletion of either gene alone [ 66 , 76 ] . It was argued that inhibition of two distinct pathways causes severe defects or that AP - 1 and Gga proteins have at least different cargo selectivity . In addition , it has been shown that Gga proteins control the Golgi exit of Vps10p [ 66 ] . Although it might be too early to make a clear - cut statement whether yeast Gga proteins regulate Golgi - to - early endosome or Golgi - to - late endosome transport , the data summarized above indicate an involvement in a specific Golgi - to - endosome pathway rather than in a general default Golgi exit pathway . 32 Figure 8 Vesicle mediated post - Golgi protein transport The molecular machinery for the formation of LDSVs , which might follow a direct pathway , is not known . The transport of vesicles from the Golgi to the early endosomes ( Kex2p ) and from the Golgi to the late en - dosomes ( CPY ) is disturbed in cells lacking Drs2p . Similar to cells lacking clathrin or Vps1p , no HDSV are formed in drs2 ∆ cells . Exit from the Golgi depends on Arf1 and its interaction with Gga proteins . It has been suggested that AP - 1 regulates transport to early endosomes and that Gga proteins control a parallel pathway from the Golgi to late endosomes . In addition , AP - 1 and Dnf1 / 2p have been implicated in the re - trieval of proteins from the early endosomes . 33 2 . Rationale The yeast genome encodes for two essential PI 4 - kinases , Stt4p and Pik1p . Due to the distinct localization of both phosphoinositide kinases , the pools of PI4P are involved in different cellular processes . The PI4P pool at the Golgi is produced by Pik1p and is essential for secretion and , in turn , secretion is a prerequisite for growth . To gain insights into the role of PI4P in membrane transport , it is on the one hand important to understand the regulatory network controlling PI4P production at the trans - Golgi and on the other hand one has to identify the transport machinery recruited by PI4P to the trans - Golgi . The production of PI4P can be controlled by retaining Pik1p in the cytoplasm or , in other words , by controlling the recruitment of Pik1p to the Golgi . Both mechanisms are beyond understanding . Furthermore , Pik1p can also be detected in the nucleus . The function of the nuclear pool is not understood and it is unclear whether Pik1p has a direct role in the nucleus or whether is it only sequestered in this organelle . Does Pik1p cycle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm and if so , what molecular mechanisms regulate this process ? Moreover , besides frequenin - 1 ( Frq1 ) , no proteins are known to interact with Pik1p and Frq1 has only been shown to stimulate Pik1p activity in vitro . The regu - lation of Pik1 catalytic activity in vivo remains to be elucidated . Regulators of Pik1p ac - tivity are likely to be new physical interactors , which still need to be identified . Whether the physical interactions effects membrane transport needs also to be determined . For newly identified physical interactors , the role in Pik1p regulation and membrane transport needs to be determined . By analysis of transport routes of different cargo proteins and the identification of two distinct populations of secretory vesicles , two exocytic pathways can be proposed : ( i ) a direct pathway and ( ii ) an indirect pathway via an endosomal compartment . At first , it remains to be established which exocytic routes really exist in yeast . Moreover , the mo - lecular mechanisms involved in sorting of proteins into distinct pathways are only poorly understood and it is an open question what adaptor and coat proteins are involved in transport to the surface and if SVs carry coats at all . Besides the interaction with cargo , phosphoinositides are obvious candidates for membrane signals for transient recruitment 34 of adaptor proteins to distinct sites on organelles . The pool of PI4P produced by Pik1p is the major phosphoinositide at the Golgi . Thus , PI4P binding partners at this compartment are candidates for adaptors / coats in membrane transport from the Golgi . The search for those PI4P binding targets provides an entry point into the dissection of the machinery for SVs formation . Since multiple routes to the surface have been described in the literature , it has to be shown whether Pik1p controls a specific pathway to the surface or whether the pik1 - 101 mutant phenotypes are caused by a more general mechanism such as changes in Golgi morphology or in the actin cytoskeleton ? 35 3 . Results 3 . 1 Pik1p – Bmh1 / 2p interaction 3 . 1 . 1 Pik1p interacts with 14 - 3 - 3 proteins In 2002 , the company ‘Cellzome’ reported genome - wide screening for protein - protein interactions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae [ 232 ] . Interestingly , Pik1p was found as part of a distinct complex ( # 32 ) . The 14 - 3 - 3 proteins Bmh1p and Bmh2p ( entry protein ) , the neutral trehalase proteins Nth1p and Nth2p , the transcription regulator Rtg2p as well as the serine / threonine kinase Fun31p were identified as members of this complex . In or - der to confirm the complex and to identify the protein interacting with Pik1p itself , the relationships within this complex were investigated by using the yeast - two - hybrid sys - tem . All possible combinations were tested in our own LexA - based reporter system ( in analogy to [ 233 ] ) . The plasmid pMBL31 ( backbone of pGBKT7 ( Clontech ) but LexA ) and the use of reporter strain L40 ( Invitrogen ) allowed us to use the same activation do - main ( AD ) constructs for either Gal4 or LexA based reporter systems . The only known interactor of Pik1p , Frq1p [ 126 ] , was used as a positive control . Bmh1 / 2p , when expressed as Gal4 - AD construct , interacted with Pik1p - LexA fu - sion ( full - length ) . These double transformed cells did grow on His - reporter plates and gave detectable LacZ signals ( Figure 9A / B ) . The signals were weaker than detected for the Pik1p / Frq1p interaction ( Figure 9B ) . Since the Pik1p - AD fusion showed autoactiva - tion , it was not possible to swap the DNA - binding and activation domains . The Bmh1 / 2p interaction with Pik1p could be mapped to the catalytic domain of Pik1p , as a fragment of Pik1p ( amino acids 2 - 769 , lacking the catalytic domain ) did not give rise to an interaction signal , whereas the full - length protein did ( Figure 9A ) . That both 14 - 3 - 3 proteins bind to Pik1p is not surprising since they share high similarity in their N - termini . 36 None of the other members of the complex gave a detectable interaction signal with Pik1p when tested in the yeast - two - hybrid system . Figure 9 Bmh1p and Bmh2p interact with Pik1p in Yeast - two - hybrid . ( A ) Bmh1 / 2p were fused to the Gal4 - AD and tested for yeast - two - hybrid interaction with LexA - Pik1p fu - sion . Growth was observed on reporter plates ( SC - HIS ) . Pik1p - full length interacts with Bmh1 / 2p whereas Pik1p aa 2 - 769 does not . Frq1p was used as positive control . Bmh1 / 2p interact with the C - terminal part of Pik1p . ( B ) β - galactosidase overlay assay of Pik1p and Bmh1 / 2 in the modified LexA system ( L40 , ONPG liquid culture assay , n = 5 , mean ± S . D . ) shows a weaker interaction of Pik1p with Bmh1 / 2p than with Frq1p . Experiments were done by Mike Beck ( shown for completeness ) . 37 Yeast - two - hybrid interactions need to be confirmed by biochemical methods . Therefore , bacterially expressed GST - Bmh1p was used to pull down Pik1p from yeast lysates ( Figure 10A ) . This interaction was stable up to 500mM NaCl and 1 % NP - 40 . In order to narrow down the interacting region within the 14 - 3 - 3 protein , a GST - Bmh1p fu - sion protein only containing amino acids 1 - 198 was created . Also the truncated version of Bmh1p was able to specifically pull down Pik1p from yeast lysates . Therefore , Pik1p binds to the conserved N - terminal 2 / 3 of Bmh1p ( Figure 10A ) . Since the GST - pull downs have been only performed from yeast lysates , there was a possibility that the interaction was indirect , mediated by a third unknown protein partner . To exclude this option , Pik1p was in vivo translated and GST pull downs per - formed . Both 14 - 3 - 3 proteins were able to precipitate Pik1p ( Figure 10B ) . It is worth mentioning that only a small fraction of Pik1p could be precipitated by GST - Bmh1p or GST - Bmh2p . A large portion of Pik1p could still be detected in the supernatant ( Figure 10A / B ) . This suggests that either the interaction of Pik1p with 14 - 3 - 3 is transient or that only a minor fraction of Pik1p has the ability to interact with Bmh1 / 2p due to posttrans - lational modifications . 38 Figure 10 GST - Bmh1 / 2p precipitates Pik1p . ( A ) Pik1p can be pulled - down from yeast lysates by GST - Bmh1p . Full length Bmh1p fused to GST ( pMB186 ) and GST - Bmh1p aa 1 - 198 ( pMB241 ) were expressed in E . coli , purified and incubated overnight with cleared yeast lysate ( CSY513 ) at 4˚C . GST fusion proteins were precipitated using glutathione 4B sepharose and eluated proteins analyzed by SDS - PAGE and immunoblotting . Experiment done by Mike Beck ( shown for completeness ) . ( B ) Pull - down of 35 [ S ] methionine labelled in vitro translated Pik1p with GST - Bmh1 / 2p . GST - Bmh1p ( pMB186 ) and GST - Bmh2p ( pMB187 ) were expressed in E . coli , purified and incubated overnight with in vitro translated Pik1p ( pLD103 , T N T ™ Quick Coupled Transcrip - tion / Translation System ) . GST fusion proteins were precipitated using glutathione 4B sepharose and elu - ated proteins analyzed by SDS - PAGE and immunoblotting . 3 . 1 . 2 Genetic interactions of BMH1 and BMH2 In order to learn more about the function of the interaction between Pik1p and the 14 - 3 - 3 proteins , genetic interactions were analyzed . Temperature sensitive mutant alleles of pik1 ( pik1 - 101 and pik1 - 120 , which is similar to pik1 - 83 ) were transformed with 2 µ high copy plasmids encoding Bmh1p and Bmh2p . Whereas pik1 mutants transformed as a control with the empty plasmid were able to grow at 34˚C ( Figure 11 ) , overexpression of both 14 - 3 - 3 proteins resulted in an enhancement of the growth defect in both pik1 mutant alleles ( Figure 11 ) . This suggested an inhibitory role of Bmh1p and Bmh2p on Pik1p function . 39 Figure 11 Genetic interaction of PIK1 and BMH1 / 2 Overexpression of BMH1 ( pMB180 ) and BMH2 ( pMB181 ) enhances the growth defect of pik1 - 101 ( CSY212 ) and pik1 - 120 ( YMB011 ) mutant cells at 30˚C and 34˚C . The vector alone ( pRS426 ) has no ef - fect on growth . Experiment done by Mike Beck ( shown for completeness ) . It has been demonstrated that the overexpression of yeast Bmh2p results in the suppression of mutation in the clathrin heavy chain gene , CHC1 [ 234 ] . This genetic inter - action suggested a role of 14 - 3 - 3 proteins in membrane transport . In addition , Pik1p has also been implicated in vesicular transport and Golgi function [ 34 , 122 ] . Since Bmh1p and Bmh2p displayed negative genetic interactions with Pik1p , genetic interactions be - tween the 14 - 3 - 3 proteins and other genes involved in vesicular transport were analyzed . Similar to pik1 mutants , overexpression of Bmh1p and Bmh2p results in an enhancement of the growth phenotype in mutants functioning at the Golgi ( arf1 Δ , vps1 Δ , ypt31 Δ / ypt32 ts , sec14 - 3 ) or in mutants involved in Golgi - to - plasma membrane transport ( sec1 - 1 , sec2 - 41 , sec2 - 59 , sec3 - 2 , sec4 - 8 , sec15 - 1 ) . Notable exceptions from this scheme are the sec6 - 4 and sec7 - 1 mutant alleles . On the other hand , overexpression of the 14 - 3 - 3 40 proteins had no effect on tested mutants playing a role in ER - to - Golgi transport ( sec21 - 1 , sec23 - 1 ) ( Table 2 ) . The only case of suppression of the growth defect was observed for the temperature - sensitive allele of the yeast NSF homologue ( sec18 - 1 ) ( Table 2 ) . Fur - thermore , a strong enhancement of the growth defect was found in the cytoskeleton mu - tants act1 - 2 and myo2 - 66 ( Table 2 ) . Both , Act1p and Myo2p , have previously been shown to be involved in transport of secretory carriers to the plasma membrane [ 235 - 237 ] . The observed strong interaction between 14 - 3 - 3 and and cytoskeleton genes is in line with the previously described defect in actin organization and polarized targeting of vesicles due to overexperession of a Bmh2p C - terminal fragment [ 238 ] . The genetic in - teractions implicate that Bmh1p and Bmh2p play a role in the regulation of membrane traffic probably acting at late stages in the secretory pathway . Because Bmh1 / 2p showed also negative interactions with pik1 mutants and all the late - acting Sec proteins are down - stream of Pik1p , 14 - 3 - 3 proteins might act upstream of these genes . 41 Transport step Allele Genetic interaction ER - Golgi sec21 - 1 sec23 - 1 - - intra Golgi arf1 ∆ vps1 ∆ ypt31 ∆ ypt32 ts sec14 - 3 ⇓ ⇓ ⇓ ( ⇓ ) Golgi – plasma membrane sec1 - 1 sec2 - 49 sec2 - 59 sec3 - 2 sec4 - 8 sec6 - 4 sec7 - 1 sec15 - 1 ( ⇓ ) ⇓ ⇓ ( ⇓ ) ⇓ - - ⇓ general factor sec18 - 1 sec19 - 1 act1 - 2 myo2 - 66 ⇑ - ⇓ ⇓ Table 2 Effect of Bmh1 / 2p overexpression on growth of mutants of genes regulating membrane transport Mutants involved in secretion were transformed with pMB180 ( BMH1 - 2 µ ) and pMB181 ( BMH2 - 2 µ ) and grown at 25˚C , 30˚C , 34˚C and 37˚C . Synthetic enhancement is indicated with ⇓ , suppression with ⇑ . Weak genetic interactions are specified with ( ⇓ ) or ( ⇑ ) . Experi - ment done by Mike Beck ( shown for completeness ) . 3 . 1 . 3 Pik1p and Bmh1 / 2p interaction is phosphorylation dependent 14 - 3 - 3 proteins have been shown to bind to phosphorylated motifs within their targets and as shown in Figure 10 , only a small portion of Pik1p did interact with Bmh1p and Bmh2p . Thus , it was reasonable to assume that the Pik1p - Bmh1 / 2p interaction might depend on phosphorylation and that under wild type conditions only a minor fraction of Pik1p is actually phosphorylated . 42 It has been shown in some late - acting sec mutants that Pik1p exist in a highly phosphorylated form at the restrictive temperature ( Christiane Walch - Solimena , unpub - lished data ) . In order to increase the amount of phosphorylated Pik1p , the experiments were therefore performed with yeast lysates from sec6 - 4 cells after shift for 1h to 37˚C where most of the Pik1p is found in a phosphorylated state ( see Figure 17 ) . Pik1p could be pulled - down with GST - Bmh1p and GST - Bmh2p in the presence of phosphatase in - hibitors ( NaF , Na 3 VO 4 ) ( Figure 12 ) . In agreement with our prediction , in the absence of phosphatase inhibitors and after incubation with λ - PPase Pik1p could not be precipitated . Thus , the interaction between these two proteins requires phosphorylation of Pik1p ( Fig - ure 12 ) . Figure 12 GST - Bmh1 / 2p interaction with Pik1p depends on Pik1p phosphorylation GST - Bmh1p ( pMB186 ) and GST - Bmh2p ( pMB187 ) were expressed in E . coli , purified and incubated overnight with cleared yeast lysate from a sec6 - 4 strain ( NY17 ) at 4˚C . GST fusion proteins were precipi - tated using glutathione 4B sepharose and eluated proteins were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and immunoblot - ting . If phosphorylation of Pik1p was protected by phosphatase inhibitors ( 25mM NaF and 100 µ M Na 3 VO 4 ) Pik1p was precipitated by GST - Bmh1 / 2p , whereas treatment with 5000 U of λ - PPase abolished the interaction . It has been show for mammalian PI4KIII β that autophosphorylation of the protein is involved in the regulation of kinase activity [ 239 ] . It might well be that autophos - phorylation of Pik1p creates binding sites for Bmh1 / 2p which in turn regulate Pik1p catalytic activity . The standard pik1 mutant allele used in the lab is pik - 101 . Various phe - notypes on post - Golgi transport , aberrant Golgi morphology and on the actin cytoskelon have been established in this mutant . This allele harbors a single point mutation ( S1045F ) 43 within its catalytic domain . This mutated serine could have been a potential phosphoryla - tion site . Furthermore , pik1 - 101 mutant cells show very low kinase activity at 37˚C [ 34 ] and could , therefore , be defective in autophosphorylation . If autophosphorylation is re - quired for Bmh1 / 2p binding to Pik1p , GST - Bmh1p and GST - Bmh2p should be unable to pull - down Pik1p from yeast lysates of pik1 - 101 mutant cells . Pik1 - 101p could be pre - cipitated from yeast lysates of sec6 - 4 pik1 - 101 double mutants ( 1h , 37˚C ) by GST - Bmh1p and GST - Bmh2p ( Figure 13 ) . This suggested that S 1045 is either not phosphory - lated or not essential for the 14 - 3 - 3 protein interaction with Pik1p . Moreover this result excludes autophosphorylation of Pik1p as a major contribution to the phospho - sites in - volved in Bmh1 / 2p binding . Figure 13 Kinase dead Pik1p still binds to GST - Bmh1 / 2 . Cleared yeast lysate obtained from sec6 - 4 pik1 - 101 strain ( CSY221 ) after 1h shift to 37˚C was incubated overnight with GST - Bmh1 / 2p at 4˚C . GST fusion proteins were precipitated using glutathione 4B sepha - rose and eluated proteins were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and immunoblotting . Mutant Pik1p can still be precipitated ruling out autophosphorylation of Pik1p as a major contribution to the phosphorylation in - volved in Bmh1 / 2p binding . 3 . 1 . 4 Localization of the Pik1p - Bmh1 / 2p complex Pik1p is a protein that is recruited to the Golgi apparatus by a so far unknown mechanism . It is unlikely that soluble proteins involved in multiple cellular processes , as it is the case for 14 - 3 - 3 proteins , confer specific targeting of a PI 4 - kinase to a membrane . Nevertheless , one can imagine that Bmh1 / 2p are involved in the regulation of subcellular 44 localization . To investigate possible colocalization of Bmh1 / 2p and Pik1p , double imunofluorescence was performed . Cells were stained with α - myc antibody for Bmh1p - 13xmyc or Bmh2p - 13xmyc and and with α - Pik1p antibody for Pik1p . Bmh1p and Bmh2p did neither localize with Pik1p at punctuate structures representing the Golgi ( Figure 14A ) , nor did they significantly colocalize with the pool of Pik1p within the nu - cleus ( Figure 14A ) . As shown by double labeling with DAPI for DNA , Bmh1p was clearly excluded from the nucleus . Cytoplasmic labeling was diffuse , indicating that Bmh1p does not associate with any particular membrane ( Figure 14A ) . Bmh2p was evenly distributed throughout the cell in a punctate pattern . It displayed a weak colocali - zation with Pik1p in the nucleus ( Figure 14A ) . These data suggested that the major pool of the 14 - 3 - 3 proteins is within the cytoplasm and , therefore , no major pool of these pro - teins is present on the Golgi . Thus , it is unlikely that 14 - 3 - 3 proteins contribute to the binding of Pik1p to the Golgi or are involved in the nuclear function of Pik1p . The nuclear pool of Pik1p did not completely coincide with DNA labeling by DAPI ( Figure 14A ) . Instead , Pik1p colocalizes with the nucleolar marker ( nucleolar anti - body 2 . 3b [ 240 ] ) and is only adjacent to DNA ( Figure 14B ) . 45 Figure 14 Localization of Pik1p and Bmh1 / 2p by immunofluorescence microscopy ( A ) Pik1p and Bmh1 / 2p do not colocalize on the Golgi or in the nucleus . Genomically myc - tagged Bmh1p ( YMB054 ) or Bmh2p ( YMB058 ) were analyzed by immunofluoresce microscopy using α - Pik1p antise - rum , α - myc antibody ( 9E10 ) and DAPI . ( B ) Pik1p localizes to the nucleolus as shown by colocalization with a nucleolar marker ( nucleolar antibody 2 . 3b ) . Experiment in panel B performed by Peggy Hsu ( shown for completeness ) . The immunofluorescence experiments suggested that Pik1p - Bmh1 / 2p interaction occurs primarily in the cytoplasm . In order to demonstrate this by subcellular fractiona - tion , a yeast strain expressing Pik1p - TAP and Bmh2p - 13myc fusion proteins was con - structed . The tagged versions of the proteins were fully functional . Experiments were per - formed in a wild type and a sec6 - 4 background . The sec6 - 4 background was again chosen to facilitate the phosphorylation dependent interaction of Pik1p with Bmh1 / 2p . Pik1p was found in both , supernatant and pellet of a 13 , 000xg and a 100 , 000xg spin . Bmh1 / 2p was 46 detected in both 13 , 000xg supernatant and pellet but mostly in the soluble fraction of the 100 , 000xg spin and to a small extent in a microsomal membrane fraction ( 100 , 000xg pellet ; Figure 15 ) . The obtained result that only a minor fraction localizes to membranes is in agreement with the fact that Pik1p is a soluble protein , which has to be recruited to the Golgi . The data suggested that Bmh1 / 2p likely function in binding to a cytosolic pool of Pik1p . Figure 15 Subcellular distribution of Pik1p and Bmh1 / 2p Pik1p - TAP and Bmh1 / 2p were localized by subcellular fractionation . Fractions were prepared from wild type or se6 - 4 strains containing Pik1p - TAP and Bmh2p - 13xmyc ( YMB118 or YMB119 respectively ) and equal volumes loaded . Proteins were separated by SDS - PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting . Pik1p and Bmh2 are detectable in all fractions , but the major fractions are found in the S 100 fraction . Experiment done by Mike Beck ( shown for completeness ) . Since we had observed that overexpression of Bmh1 / 2p enhances the tempera - ture - sensitive phenotype of a number of sec mutants we concluded that the 14 - 3 - 3 pro - teins might be negative regulators of Pik1p function . Considering that the interaction between both proteins occurs primarily in the cytoplasm , we reasoned that increase of Bmh1 / 2p levels in the cell might result in a loss of Pik1p from the TGN and thus im - paired secretion . However , overexpression of either BMH1 or BMH2 from a high copy ( 2 µ ) plasmid did not affect Pik1p localization to the TGN according to immunofluores - 47 cence microscopy . In addition , the nucleolar Pik1p could still be found using im - munofluorescence microscopy ( Figure 16 ) . Figure 16 Bmh1 / 2p overexpression does not effect Pik1p localization . Wild type yeasts overexpressing Bmh1p ( pMB180 ) or Bmh2p ( pMB181 ) were processed for immunofluo - rescence microscopy using α - Pik1p antiserum and DAPI . Pik1p is still localized to the Golgi and the nu - cleolus . 48 3 . 1 . 5 Overexpression of 14 - 3 - 3 proteins inhibits membrane transport Overexpression of Bmh1p and Bmh2p had negative effects on the growth of pik1 mutants and other late acting sec genes . This data raised the possibility that overproduc - tion of these proteins in itself was able to generate a phenocopy of membrane transport defects observed in this mutant background . For this , the localization of GFP - tagged plasma membrane proteins that are transported through the secretory pathway was evalu - ated by fluorescence microscopy . This method had the advantage that distinct intracellu - lar accumulations can be observed . A C - terminally GFP - tagged version of the general amino acid permease Gap1 * p ( Gap1K9K16 ) [ 45 , 46 ] was used . This mutant allele is lacking ubiquitination and , therefore , transported exclusively to the cell surface . The fu - sion protein was placed under the control of the inducible GALs promoter . Since the ex - pression of the Gap1 * 1p - GFP was inducible , not steady - state levels were analyzed but rather transport kinetics are observable . Bmh1p ( not shown ) and more strikingly Bmh2p overexpresssion ( Figure 17 ) resulted in an internal accumulation of Gap1 * p - GFP similar to the one observed in pik1 - 101 ( Figure 17 ) or pik1 - 120 ( data not shown ) indicating a partial block in exocytosis . This data suggests that Pik1p and Bmh1 / 2p act together in regulation of exocytosis , and that Bmh1 / 2p might counteract Pik1p function at the Golgi . 49 Figure 17 Overexpression of Bmh2p in wild type cells phenocopies the transport defect of Gap1 ( K9K16 ) - GFP in pik1 - 101 . Wild type cells overexpressing Bmh1p ( pMB181 ) and pik1 - 101 cells were transformed with Gap1 * p - GFP ( TBQ99 ) . Cells were grown overnight in YPRaf . The expression was induced by addition of galactose ( 2 % final ) for 3h . The reporter construct was visualized by fluorescence microscopy . Intracellular punctate structures are visible in pik1 - 101 cells and wild type cells overexpressing Bmh2p . 3 . 1 . 6 Nucleo - cytoplasmic shuttling of Pik1p is regulated by phosphorylation and 14 - 3 - 3 binding Pik1p is a soluble protein , which is recruited to the Golgi by an unknown mechanism . Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy has shown that a major pool of the protein is present in the nucleolus . It has been previously described that Pik1p and other nuclear proteins rapidly and reversibly translocate from the nucleus to the cytoplasm upon secre - tion block in a number of sec mutants [ 34 , 241 ] . This regulatory circuit has been named ‘arrest of secretion response’ or ASR and is distinct from other stress - related cellular re - sponses [ 241 ] . The observed nucleo - cytoplasmic shuttling of Pik1p was used to investi - 50 gate whether phosphorylation and thus 14 - 3 - 3 binding correlates with this translocation event . Using a modified SDS - PAGE system [ 242 ] , two forms of Pik1p with a slight dif - ference in electrophoretic mobility in wild - type cells were separated ( Figure 18A ) . Upon shift to 37°C , a minor increase in the higher molecular weight form was observed . This gel - shift was due to phosphorylation as after treatment with λ - PPase , only the lower band could be detected . ( Figure 18A ) . Interestingly , a major shift to a higher molecular weight band was detected in sec6 - 4 mutant cells after shift to the restrictive temperature , where previously a complete translocation of Pik1p from the nucleus to the cytoplasm has been observed ( Figure 18A ) . A by error - prone PCR generated temperature - sensitive pik1 mu - tant allele , named pik1 - 130 , had a defect in nucleolar but not cytoplasmic punctate stain - ing for Pik1p in immunofluorescence experiments at the restrictive temperature ( Figure 18B ) . Under these conditions , Pik1p was exclusively in a higher , phosphorylated form ( Figure 18A ) demonstrating in an independent approach that translocation of Pik1p from the nucleolus to the cytoplasm correlates with phosphorylation . It has to be noted that the mutant Pik1p protein is unstable at the restricted temperature of 37˚C making its detec - tion difficult . We propose a model in which Pik1p phosphorylation and 14 - 3 - 3 binding might regulate nucleo - cytoplasmic shuttling . 51 Figure 18 Pik1p translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm correlates with a shift to a phosphorylated form . ( A ) Wild type ( NY1211 ) , sec6 - 4 ( NY778 ) and pik1 - 130 ( YMB087 ) cells were treated with phosphatase inhibitors and incubated either at 25˚C or 37˚C for 30 mins , lysed and subjected to SDS - PAGE and im - munoblotting . Alternatively , cells were shifted to 37˚C for 30 min , lysed in the absence of phosphatase inhibitors and subsequently incubated with λ - PPase . ( B ) pik1 - 130 mutants were subjected to immunofluo - rescence microscopy using α - Pik1p antiserum and DAPI . Upon shift to 37˚C , mutant Pik1p is excluded from the nucleus . 52 3 . 2 Identification of multicopy suppressors of pik1 - 101 cells 3 . 2 . 1 Genetic interactions The PI4 - kinase Pik1p has been shown to be involved in post Golgi transport and in maintaining normal Golgi morphology [ 34 , 122 ] . Nevertheless , proteins mediating the pik1 - 101 phenotypes remain elusive . In order to identify proteins regulating Pik1p func - tion itself or proteins recruited to the Golgi by PI4P , a multicopy suppressor screen using the temperature - sensitive allele pik1 - 101 was performed . This approach has been used to study the Stt4p pathway and led to the successful identification of Sfk1p [ 120 ] . Sfk1p has been shown to facilitate the localization of the essential PI4 - kinase Stt4p to the plasma membrane . Moreover , Mss4p , the so far only known PI4P 5 - kinase in yeast , has been identified as multicopy suppressor of the stt4 - 1 mutant allele [ 243 ] . Upon screening of 26 , 600 colonies at 37˚C and 39 , 000 colonies at 34˚C , 17 plas - mids rescuing the growth defect of pik - 101 cells were isolated and sequenced . The PIK1 gene was isolated twice . Single genes were subcloned into pRS426 and tested again for suppression of the mutant growth defect . With the exception of PIK1 itself , none of the recovered suppressors was able to restore growth up to 37˚C . The overexpression of RME1 , TIF6 , CDC37 , MSN1 , MPS1 , PRE4 as well as the overexpression of the unknown open reading frames YHL035C , YDR031W , YNL013C , YBR085C - A , YMR134W and YMR135W - A rescued the growth defect up to 34˚C ( Figure 19 / Table 3 ) . The suppressors were named ROP1 to ROP12 ( ROP for Rescuer of pik1 - 101 ) . Overexpression of these genes in pik1 - 120 , another temperature sensitive allele with 5 mutations in its center part and its catalytic domain , or in stt4 - 1 , the other essential PI4 - kinase , failed to rescue growth defects at higher temperature ( data not shown ) demonstrating allele - and gene - specificity of the isolated suppressors . 53 Figure 19 Suppressors of the pik1 - 101 growth defect Genes isolated from the genomic library as putative suppressors of the growth defect of pik - 101 were sub - cloned into pRS426 ( pLD033 – pLD059 ) and transformed into pik1 - 101 cells ( CSY215 ) . Transformants were spotted onto YPD or SC - URA plates and grown at 25˚C , 30˚C , 34˚C and 37˚C . Suppressors only par - tially suppressed the growth defect up to 34˚C except Pik1p , which showed suppression up to 37˚C .

The localization was obtained by fusing 3xHA to the C - terminus of each ORF . The expression was under the control of the endogenous promoters . PM = plasma membrane , internal punctate = intracellular dotty structures , which are not positive for Sec7 , n . d . = not determined 54 At present , the only proteins known to interact directly with Pik1p are frequenin - 1 ( FRQ1 ) [ 126 ] , Bmh1p and Bmh2p ( see above ) . Frq1p is a multicopy suppressor of pik1 - 11 and pik1 - 24 . These are mutant alleles lacking any mutation within the carboxy - terminal catalytic domain . None of the mutant alleles harboring mutations in the catalytic domain , including the pik1 - 120 ( alias pik1 - 83 ) allele , are suppressed by Frq1p overex - pression [ 126 ] . Since the pik1 - 101 growth defect was not suppressed by Frq1p overex - pression it was of interest to determine whether the isolated suppressors were able to sup - press the ts - phenotype of pik1 mutant alleles lacking any mutation within the catalytic domain . N - terminal ts - mutants were created by random PCR mutagenesis . Three mutant alleles , named pik1 - 130 , pik1 - 131 and pik1 - 133 , were isolated . ROP s were transformed into N - terminal mutant pik1 alleles and tested for suppression at the non - permissive tem - perature . Again , overexpression of ROP s did not rescue the growth defect ( data not shown ) . This data suggests that the ROP s are specific for alleles carrying exclusively mutations within the catalytic domain . In order to investigate whether there is a functional interaction of Pik1p and one of the Rop proteins , double mutants of pik1 - 101 in yeast strains with a deletion of the suppressing ORF YHL035C , YDR031W , YNL013C , YMR135W - A ( Saccharomyces Dele - tion Project / EUROSCARF ) were generated . A synthetic growth defect would support a function of Pik1p and its suppressor in a common pathway . A synthetic growth defect could not be observed in double mutants of pik1 - 101 and yhl035C , ydr031w , ynl013C , ymr135w - a ( data not shown ) . 3 . 2 . 2 Pik1p expression levels are not elevated In order to exclude that ROP s are simply activators of Pik1p expression , it was investigated whether overexpression of the ROP s caused elevated Pik1p expression levels ( Figure 20 ) . RME1 , MSN1 and TIF6 are genes involved in transcription or translation . Since no increased Pik1p levels were observed as a result of the overexpression of these genes , they are likely to interfere with the nuclear function of Pik1p or regulate other proteins acting with Pik1p . 55 Figure 20 Overexpression of ROP s does not increase Pik1p expression levels . Wild type ( NY13 ) and pik1 - 101 cells ( CSY215 ) transformed ROP s in pRS426 ( pLD033 – pLD059 ) or pRS426 alone were lysed and subjected to SDS - PAGE and immunoblotting . 3 . 2 . 3 Localization of Rop proteins To evaluate the isolated suppressors of pik1 - 101 , plasmids encoding for a fusion protein of the suppressor with 3xHA were transformed into wild type cells and analyzed for potential Golgi localization by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy . Suppressors localizing in dependence on Pik1p activity to the Golgi would have been of particular in - terest since they could be putative PI4P effectors . None of the ROP s did localize to the Golgi or the bud tip ( Figure 21 and Table 3 ) . Instead , the localization experiments re - vealed cytoplasmic and nuclear ( RME1 , TIF6 , MSN1 , PRE4 , YBR085C - A ) staining , the staining of the nuclear envelope and the cortical ER ( YMR134W ) as well as some intra - cellular punctate staining ( YHL035C , YDR031W , YNL013C , YMR135W - A ) . Double la - beling with Kex2p - 13myc , a marker of the Golgi and early endosomes , and localization experiments in the class E vps mutant Δ vps27 mutant cells also suggested that the ROP s do not localize to an endosomal compartment . These observations suggested that the Rop proteins are not required for recruiting Pik1p to the Golgi and also excluded the possibil - ity that the tested ROP s are putative downstream components ( e . g . coat components ) re - cruited to the Golgi by binding PI4P . 56 Figure 21 Rop - 3xHA fusion proteins do not localize to the Golgi . Rops were fused to 3xHA and expressed under the control of their own promoters ( pLD078 – pLD085 ) . Constructs were transformed into wild type cells ( CSY321 ) and processed for indirect immunofluorescence microscopy . Rop - 3xHA fusion proteins localize to the cytoplasm , nucleus , ER , punctate structures at the plasma membrane or to some internal punctate structures . 3 . 2 . 4 Rescue of pik1 - 101 mutant phenotypes In order to determine why these proteins partially suppress the growth defect of pik1 - 101 cells , rescue of pik1 - 101 mutant phenotypes was investigated . Mutant cells dis - play a reduced secretion competence of Suc2p ( invertase ) [ 34 ] . Overexpression of single ROP in pik - 101 mutant cells did not restore the secretion of invertase to levels seen in wild type cells ( data not shown ) . Another striking phenotype of pik1 - 101 mutant cells is the accumulation of Golgi membranes [ 34 ] , most likely due to the inability to release transport carriers . Wild type cells , pik1 - 101 cells and pik1 - 101 mutants overexpressing a 57 single ROP gene were shifted for 1h to the restrictive temperature of 37˚C , fixed with glutaraldehyde and prepared for analysis by EM . In comparison to wild type cells , pik1 - 101 mutant cells showed enlarged , donut - shaped Golgi structures , which are referred to as Berkeley bodies . These Berkeley bodies had constricted areas , which might represent budding profiles . In addition , pik1 - 101 cells did not display accumulation of vesicles as it was the case in other late - acting sec - mutants . Surprisingly , no ROP - gene was able to res - cue this mutant phenotype . Instead , overexpression of ROP4 , ROP8 and ROP9 caused a change in Golgi morphology to an even larger " pearls on a string " like structure ( Figure 22 ) . This suggested that cells overexpressing ROP4 , ROP8 and ROP9 might not be any - more inhibited at the step of budding but arrest at a later fission state . Figure 22 ROP4 , ROP8 and ROP9 overexpression in pik1 - 101 cells effects Golgi morphology . ROP4 ( pLD046 ) , ROP8 ( pLD045 ) and ROP9 ( pLD048 ) were overexpressed in pik1 - 101 cells ( CSY215 ) , fixed and processed for electron microscopy . pik1 - 101 mutant cells show Berkeley bodies , representing enlarged Golgi structures . No rescue of the phenotype could be observed due to the overexpression of the ROP s , instead even larger Golgi structures were visible . bar = 100nm 58 Nevertheless , the identification of putative PI4P binding proteins and , therefore , putative coat components is still the main focus of the work . Therefore , no further work has been done on the Rop proteins . 3 . 3 Identification of the PI4P regulated pathway 3 . 3 . 1 Genetic interaction of Pik1p and Gga2p In yeast , at least two routes exit the Golgi towards the plasma membrane . One of these routes is thought to involve the endosomal system . Until now , limited information about the regulation of these pathways is available . Two types of SVs , HDSVs and LDSVs , have been described . The machinery regulating sorting into and formation of these specialized SVs is unknown [ 38 , 39 ] . The machinery required for tethering and fu - sion of these post - Golgi vesicles instead seems to consist of the known late - acting Sec proteins ( exocyst , Sec4p ) [ 38 , 39 ] . Interestingly , pik1 - 101 is synthetic lethal with most of these late - acting sec genes as well as with Golgi GTPases such as ARF1 , YPT1 and YPT31 / 32 [ 34 ] . In order to shed some light on the identity of proteins involved in sorting and budding on the Golgi or endosome and on the proteins binding to PI4P and by this means regulating the Pik1p pathway , a genome - wide synthetic lethality screen has been performed ( approach adopted from [ 244 ] ) . The pik1 - 101 strain was crossed with around 4800 single deletion strains that represent the complete set of viable haploid deletion mutants in Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( Euroscarf ) . Among other genes involved in the transport between Golgi and the endosomal system , the synthetic genetic array analysis identified GGA2 , a monomeric adaptor protein implicated in the transport from the Golgi to the prevacuolar compartment ( PVC ) [ 41 , 66 , 76 , 217 , 245 ] . Double mutants of pik1 - 101 and gga2 ∆ showed reduced growth at 25°C relative to the parental strains harboring only a single mutation . The synthetic sick interaction was confirmed by tetrad analysis ( Figure 23A ) . Moreover , double mutants of pik1 - 101 and alp4 ∆ ( AP - 1 subunit ) are syn - 59 thetic lethal ( data not shown ) . These results indicated that Pik1p and AP - 1 might function in parallel pathways whereas Pik1p and Gga2 might play a common role in the same pathway . In addition , PIK1 was overexpressed from a 2 µ plasmid in yeasts having a dele - tion of GGA1 , GGA2 or GGA1 / 2 . Wild type yeasts transformed either with the empty plasmid or the Pik1p expressing plasmid were able to grow . However , gga1 / 2 ∆ cells overexpressing Pik1p did grow much slower than cells transformed with the empty plas - mid ( Figure 23B ) . These genetic interactions , in which both , decrease or increase in PI4P impairs growth of gga2 ∆ cells , indicate a functional relationship between Pik1p and Gga2p . Figure 23 Pik1p interacts genetically with Gga2p . ( A ) pik1 - 101 cells were crossed to the entire yeast deletion collection from Euroscarf . The synthetic sick interaction between pik1 - 101 and gga2 ∆ was confirmed by tetrad analysis . Red - circled colonies are pik1 - 101 gga2 ∆ double mutants . Experiment done by Maike Gravert ( shown for completeness ) ( B ) PIK1 ( CSP8 ) was overexpressed in wild type ( CSY138 ) , gga1 ∆ ( CSY139 ) , gga2 ∆ ( CSY140 ) or gga1 / 2 ∆ ( CSY141 ) cells . gga2 ∆ cells overexpressing PIK1 grew much slower than control cells with the empty vector . Ex - periment performed by Christiane Walch - Solimena ( shown for completeness ) . 3 . 3 . 2 Transport of GFP - tagged plasma membrane proteins in pik1 - 101 cells Pik1p has been implicated in the regulation of exit from the Golgi apparatus [ 34 ] . Until now , there were no assays available which were able to discriminate between the different Golgi exit routes . In order to solve the question whether Pik1p favors a specific 60 exocytic pathway , the transport of GFP - tagged plasma membrane proteins Pma1p , a chi - mera between Fus1p and Mid2p ( Fus - Mid ) and Gap1 ( K9K16 ) p ( Gap1 * p ) was analyzed . Pma1p , the major plasma membrane ATPase , has been reported to require raft associa - tion and was transported via a probably direct pathway to the cell surface [ 42 ] . The inte - gral plasma membrane protein Fus1p plays a role in cell fusion during the mating proc - ess . It has been demonstrated that proper O - glycosylation of Fus1p was necessary for its delivery to the plasma membrane . The Fus - Mid chimera construct also required intact lipid rafts and O - glycosylation for its transport to the surface [ 246 ] . The general amino acid permease Gap1p is transported to the cell surface in dependence on the nitrogen source . Cells growing under poor nitrogen conditions ( proline ) transport Gap1p to the cell surface . If cells were then shifted to medium with a good nitrogen source ( glutamine ) , Gap1p is transported to the vacuole . In addition , newly synthesized Gap1p was also routed towards the vacuole . Entry in the degradation pathway relied on ubiquitination of Gap1p [ 44 - 47 ] . Gap1p has also been shown not to be associated with rafts / DRMs [ 43 ] . The used mutant of Gap1p lacked ubiquitination sites [ 45 ] and , therefore , cannot be in - ternalized and was independent of the nitrogen condition provided by the media . All three constructs were placed under the control of the inducible GALs promoter . Wild type and pik1 - 101 mutant cells were grown up overnight in medium con - taining raffinose as sole carbohydrate source . Expression of the GFP - tagged marker was induced 3 hours prior to microscopy . The temperature shift to the restricted temperature of 37˚C was performed during the last hour of induction . Wild type and mutant cells ex - pressing Fus - Mid - GFP showed a strong and robust labeling of the plasma membrane ( Figure 24 ) . In addition , some labeling of the vacuole was visible , most likely due to overexpression of Fus - Mid - GFP indicating a saturation of the transport and sorting ma - chinery under the chosen experimental conditions ( Figure 24 ) . The observed labeling of the vacuole was not due to endocytosis since the same labeling with Fus - Mid - GFP was obtained in the endocytosis mutant end4 ( Tomasz Proszynski and Robin Klemm , per - sonal communication ) . The marker Pma1p - GFP also showed a bright labeling of the plasma membrane and of the vacuole in wild type and pik - 101 cells at both temperatures ( Figure 24 ) . Internal punctate labeling could be observed below the plasma membrane in wild type and pik1 - 101 cells at 25˚C . This labeling was not visible anymore after shifting 61 cells to the restricted temperature of 37˚C ( Figure 24 ) . Probably , these dots represented early endosomes . Wild type cells expressing Gap1 * p - GFP showed bright labeling of the plasma membrane and in some cells a faint labeling of the nuclear envelope . Faint punc - tate structures directly below the plasma membrane could be seen in a few cells . After shifting wild type cells to 37˚C , fluorescence within the vacuole was apparent ( Figure 24 ) . In pik1 - 101 mutant cells , an accumulation of large internal punctate structures , most likely representing the Golgi apparatus , could already be observed in cell growing at the permissive temperature ( Figure 24 and Figure 25 ) . This is not surprising since the mutant allele used has a significantly reduced catalytic kinase activity already at 25˚C [ 34 ] . Upon shifting pik1 - 101 cells to 37˚C , an increase in the accumulation of Gap1 * p in internal membrane structures was observed . Mutant cells growing at 37˚C also showed a faint vacuolar labeling ( Figure 24 ) . These data suggest that Pik1p and PI4P are not essential for transport of plasma membrane proteins which are associated with detergent resistant membranes ( DRMs , rafts ) and which follow the direct route towards the plasma mem - brane . In contrast , pik1 - 101 cells are accumulating Gap1 * p at the level of the Golgi , sug - gesting a role of the PI 4 - kinase Pik1p in specialized traffic to the cell surface . 62 Figure 24 In pik1 - 101 cells the delivery of Gap1 * p - GFP to the surface is inhibited . Wild type ( NY604 ) and pik1 - 101 ( YMB064 ) cells were transformed with Fus - Mid - GFP ( TBQ55 , ) Gap1 * p - GFP ( TBQ99 ) and Pma1p - GFP ( TBQ106 ) . Cells were grown overnight at 25˚C in SCRaf - URA . Next day , expression was induced by addition of galactose to a final concentration of 2 % for 3h . The temperature shift was performed during the last hour of induction . Subsequently , cells were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy . pik1 - 101 cells are defective in delivery of Gap1 * p - GFP to the surface whereas the transport of DRM - associated proteins is not effected in this assay . 63 3 . 3 . 3 Gap1 * p - GFP transport is inhibited in gga2 ∆ mutant at the Golgi The identification of Gga2p as a genetic interactor of Pik1p raised the possibility that both proteins regulate the same pathway . Therefore , the transport of Pma1p - GFP , Fus - Mid - GFP and Gap1 * p - GFP was analyzed in gga1 ∆ , gga2 ∆ and gga1 / 2 ∆ mutant cells . As described before , wild type cells showed a robust labeling of the plasma mem - brane and a few faint punctate structures below the plasma membrane ( Figure 25 ) . Domi - nant plasma membrane labeling could also be observed in all gga ∆ mutants . Wheras no accumulation of Gap1 * p on internal membranes was visible in gga1 ∆ cells , cell lacking gga2 showed an inhibition of transport to the surface and accumulated Gap1 * p in punc - tate structures ( Figure 25 ) . The transport of Pma1p - GFP and Fus - Mid - GFP was unaf - fected in all gga ∆ mutants ( data not shown ) . Figure 25 Delivery of Gap1 * p - GFP to the surface is inhibited in cells with a deletion of GGA2 . Wild type ( CSY138 ) , gga1 ∆ ( CSY139 ) , gga2 ∆ ( CSY140 ) or gga1 / 2 ∆ ( CSY141 ) were transformed with Gap1 * p - GFP ( TBQ99 ) . Cells were grown overnight at 25˚C in SCRaf - URA . Next day , expression was induced by addition of galactose ( 2 % final ) for 3h . Subsequently , cells were analyzed by fluorescence mi - croscopy . gga2 ∆ and gga1 / 2 ∆ cells showed a strong effect on transport of Gap1 * p - GFP to the surface . 64 Gga proteins have been shown to regulate exit from the Golgi [ 66 ] . In order to confirm that the inhibition of Gap1 * p transport to the cell surface was at the level of the Golgi , Gap1 * p - GFP was colocalized with the late Golgi marker Sec7p in wild type and gga2 ∆ cells . Wild type cells did not accumulate Gap1 * p - GFP and , therefore , no colocali - zation with Sec7 - dsRed could be observed . In contrast , Sec7 - dsRed positive structures clearly colocalized with Gap1 * p - GFP accumulation within gga2 ∆ cells ( Figure 26 ) . Figure 26 Delivery of Gap1 * p - GFP to the surface is blocked in the Golgi in gga2 ∆ cells . Wild type ( CSY138 ) and gga2 ∆ ( CSY140 ) cells were cotransformed with Gap1 * p - GFP ( TBQ99 ) and Sec7 - dsRed ( TBQ128 ) . Cells were grown overnight at 25˚C in SCRaf - URA . Next day , expression was induced by addition of galactose to a final concentration of 2 % for 3h . Subsequently , cells were analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy . In gga2 ∆ cells the intracellular accumulation of Gap1 * p - GFP colo - calized with the late Golgi marker Sec7 fused to dsRed . These results indicate that Pik1p and Gga2p might be involved in the regulation of the same exocytic pathway , namely the pathway assumed by Gap1 * p . In both cases , the transport of markers ( Fus - Mid , Pma1p ) trafficking to the surface via the direct pathway was mostly unaffected . Furthermore , in agreement with their previously implied role in 65 Golgi exit [ 34 , 66 , 122 ] , pik1 - 101 and gga2 ∆ mutants block Gap1 * p transport at the Golgi . 3 . 3 . 4 Role of Pik1p and Gga2p in transport within the endosomal system Since Gga proteins have been shown to play a role in Golgi - to - endosome traffic , the possible common function of Pik1p and Gga2p in transport within the endosomal system was investigated . Mutants of pik1 have a reduced secretion of invertase ( Suc2p ) , which has been suggested to pass to the cell surface via an endosomal compartment [ 34 , 35 , 38 , 39 ] . Therefore , the secretion of invertase was analyzed after 1h of induction in low glucose ( 0 . 1 % ) medium and shift to 37˚C . The sec6 - 4 mutant allele served as control . In this mutant , SVs are not able to fuse with the plasma membrane anymore and , thus , secretion of invertase was decreased by 90 % ( Figure 27A ) . Whereas the secretion of in - vertase was not disturbed in gga1 ∆ , gga2 ∆ and gga1 / 2 ∆ cells , in pik - 101 cells the inver - tase secretion was reduced by 20 % relative to wild type levels in this assay ( Figure 27A ) . In agreement with the observed synthetic growth defect , the pik1 - 101 gga2 ∆ double mu - tant showed a synthetic defect in the secretion of invertase , which was reduced by 40 % . ( Figure 27A ) . This result suggests a common function of Pik1p and Gga2p in regulation of invertase secretion . The furin - like protease Kex2p is required for the processing of pro - α factor [ 57 ] . Mutations in the machinery required for Golgi exit or the retention from the PVC results in Kex2p mislocalization [ 66 , 247 ] . As a consequence , the maturation of α factor is de - fective [ 57 , 58 ] . In gga1 / 2 ∆ cells , around 60 % of α factor is secreted as a highly glyco - sylated precursor [ 66 ] . Therefore , the secretion of biological active α factor was analyzed in pik1 - 101 , gga2 ∆ , pik1 - 101 gga2 ∆ double mutants and gga1 / 2 ∆ cells at the semi - permissive temperature of 30˚C . MAT α cells were replicated on a lawn of MAT a sst1 ∆ cells ( α factor sensitive cells ) , which will in dependence on the concentration of α factors arrest growth in G1 phase . Wild type cells were surrounded by a halo of growth inhibi - tion ( Figure 27B ) . Cells with a deletion of KEX2 showed no halo . In agreement with the described secretion of α factor precursors in gga1 / 2 ∆ cells , no or at best a very small halo 66 around MAT a gga1 / 2 ∆ cells could be observed . Single mutants of pik1 - 101 or gga2 ∆ secreted α factor at wild type levels as indicated by the same halo size around wild type , pik1 - 101 and gga2 ∆ cell ( Figure 27B ) . The double mutant pik1 - 101 gga2 ∆ was sur - rounded by a significantly smaller halo than that of the wild type ( Figure 27B ) . The assay cannot distinguish whether in the double mutant the anterograde transport / Golgi exit is blocked or whether Kex2p is missorted and , therefore , α factor processing is affected . But either way , this result suggests again a common role of Pik1p and Gga2p within the Golgi - endosome system . 67 Figure 27 Synthetic effects of the pik1 - 101 gga2 ∆ double mutant on transport within the Golgi - endosome system . ( A ) Secretion of invertase in wild type ( CSY138 ) , gga1 ∆ ( CSY139 ) , gga2 ∆ ( CSY140 ) or gga1 / 2 ∆ ( CSY141 ) , pik1 - 101 ( CSY544 ) , pik1 - 101 gga2 ∆ ( CSY545 ) and sec6 - 4 ( NY778 ) was induced by shifting cells for 1h into low glucose ( 0 . 1 % ) . The experiment was done at the restrictive temperature of 37˚C . The ratio between secreted and intracellular invertase was determined ( n = 3 , mean ± S . D . ) . ( B ) Secretion of bio - logical active α factor was investigated by the halo assay . MAT α wild type ( CSY210 ) , kex2 ∆ ( CSY711 ) , gga2 ∆ ( CSY905 ) , pik1 - 101 ( CSY544 ) , pik1 - 101 gga2 ∆ ( CSY544 ) and gga1 / 2 ∆ ( CSY141 ) were patched onto a freshly prepared lawn of MAT a sst1 ∆ cells ( CSY904 ) on YPD . After 2 days of growth at 30˚C , the surrounding halo was scored . 3 . 3 . 5 Pik1p is required for exit from the trans - Golgi It has been shown that Pik1p is not only involved in exocytosis but also regulates the VPS pathway . The transport of the vacuolar hydrolase CPY from the Golgi to the vacuole is delayed in pik1 - 101 mutant cells [ 34 ] . In order to analyze whether CPY trans - 68 port is disturbed on the level of the Golgi or at a later endosomal stage in pik1 mutant cells , the stability of Vps10p , the CPY cargo receptor , was investigated . For that purpose the class E vps mutant vps28 ∆ was used . In class E mutants , the anterograde transport from late endosomes to the vacuole and the retrograde transport from the late endosome to the Golgi are impaired . This results in an enlarged and , more importantly , proteolyti - cally active compartment . As a consequence , Vps10p cannot be retrieved to the Golgi and is degraded in this class E compartment [ 248 , 249 ] . Furthermore , mutations that block Golgi exit restore the stability of proteins ( e . g . Vps10p ) when combined with class E vps mutants . For example , it has been shown by this experimental approach that Gga1 / 2p are involved in transport between the Golgi and endosomes and that Gga proteins control exit from the Golgi . [ 66 ] . Thus , the stability of genomically tagged Vps10p - 3xHA was analyzed in wild type , pik1 - 101 , vps28 ∆ and pik1 - 101 vps28 ∆ cells . Cells were pulsed for 25 min with 35 [ S ] methionine , chased for 0 min , 30 min and 60 min and Vps10p - 3xHA was immuno - precipitated . In wild type and pik1 - 101 mutant cells , Vps10p - 3xHA was stable up to 60 min and no difference in stability could been observed between wild type and pik1 - 101 cells ( Figure 28 ) , arguing against an involvement in late endosome - to - Golgi retrieval . In contrast , Vps10p - 3xHA is unstable in vps28 ∆ cells . Already at the beginning of the chase time , 50 % of Vps10p - 3xHA was degraded to the lower proteolysis - resistant form . After 30 min and 60 min , only the lower form could be observed ( Figure28 ) . When a pik1 - 101 mutation was introduced into a vps28 ∆ mutant , Vps10p - 3xHA was significantly , al - though not completely stabilized . Both , the full - length and the protease - resistant form could be immunoprecipitated over a period of at least 60 min ( Figure 28 ) . These results suggested that Pik1p is involved in Golgi exit , and more specifically , regulates transport to the endosomal system . 69 Figure 28 Pik1p regulates exit from the Golgi . Wild type ( CSY392 ) , pik1 - 101 ( CSY391 ) , vps28 ∆ ( CSY900 ) and vps28 ∆ pik1 - 101 ( CSY399 ) containing 3xHA genomically tagged Vps10p were grown overnight in minimal medium lacking methionine . Proteins were pulsed with 35 [ S ] methionine for 25 min and then chased for 0 min , 30 min and 60 min . Proteins were precipitated with TCA , washed with acetone and Vps10p - 3xHA was immunoprecipitated using a α - HA antibody . Samples were subjected to SDS - PAGE and audioradiography . Vps10 - 3xHA * indicates the lower protease - resistant form . 3 . 3 . 6 Gga2p localization partially depends on Pik1p function In order to determine a mechanistic relationship between Pik1p and Gga2p , the localization of GFP - Gga2p to the Golgi was investigated . In contrast to mammalian cells , yeast Gga proteins according to the published literature do not depend on GTP - bound Arf1p for their Golgi localization [ 75 , 225 , 227 , 228 , 230 ] . GFP - Gga2p expressed in wild type yeast localized to the cytoplasm and to punctate structures positive for Sec7p - dsRed , indicating trans - Golgi association ( Figure 29A ) . ) . Sec7p - dsRed expression was driven by the strong TPI - promoter . Since pik1 - 101 cells do not tolerate overexpression of Sec7p , Sec7p was genomically tagged with dsRed . This Sec7 - dsRed fusion protein was fully functional but showed much fainter labeling of the Golgi . In pik1 - 101 cells , GFP - Gga2p did not localize anymore to the Golgi but instead showed a strong cytoplasmic labeling with only a few remaining small dots in the cytoplasm ( Figure 29A ) . These results were already obtained at the permissive temperature of 25˚C . This was not surprising since pik1 - 101 cells show reduced kinase activity already at 25˚C compared to wild type cells [ 34 ] . These results indicate an involvement of Pik1p in the localization of GFP - Gga2p to the trans - Golgi . 70 To confirm these microscopy data , wild type cells and pik1 - 101 cells , which were incubated for 1h at the permissive or restrictive temperature , were fractionated by differ - ential centrifugation . At the permissive temperature a significant fraction of endogenous Gga2p was pelletable in wild type cells , but in the absence of functional Pik1p , signifi - cantly less Gga2p was bound to membranes ( Figure 29B ) . Moreover , at the restrictive temperature of 37˚C , less Gga2p was found in the pellet fraction of wild type and pik1 - 101 mutant cells compared to the permissive temperature , again showing a clear reduc - tion in Gga2p membrane localization in pik1 - 101 mutant cells ( Figure 29B ) . This is an - other indication that Pik1p might be involved in the recruitment of Gga2p to the Golgi . The experiments described above left the possibility that Gga2p is not able to bind directly to PI4P but instead the interaction was indirect , mediated by a third unknown protein partner . To rule out that scenario , a protein - lipid overlay assay was performed using bacterially expressed GST - Gga2p and PIP - strips from Molecular Probes . Lipid protein overlay assays are not very reliable concerning the specificity of phosphoinositide binding but are an easy assay to evaluate the ability of direct binding to lipids . GST - Gga2p was able to bind to PI4P , PI5P , PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 , PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 but , interest - ingly , not to PI3P or PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( Figure 29C ) . It is worth noticing that the existence of PI5P , PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 in S . cerevisiae has not been shown yet . These results suggested that GST - Gga2p can bind directly to some phosphoinositides and that Gga2p is a putative PI4P effector . 71 Figure 29 Functional Pik1p is required for normal localization of Gga2p to the Golgi . ( A ) Wildtype cells expressing an additional genomic copy of Sec7 - dsRed under the control of the TPI pro - moter ( CSY349 ) and pik1 - 101 ( CSY906 ) cells containing genomically tagged Sec7 - dsRed were trans - formed with plasmids encoding for GFP - Gga2p ( pCS136 ) . Cells were grown in selective media to mid log - phase and subsequently analyzed by fluorescence microscopy . In wild type cells , Gga2p colocalizes with Sec7p - dsRed , whereas in pik1 - 101 cells GFP - Gga2p is mostly cytosolic . ( B ) Subcellular distribution of endogenous Gga2p was evaluated by subcellular fractionation from wild type ( CSY210 ) and pik1 - 101 ( CSY544 ) cells by differential centrifugation . Temperature shift to 37˚C was done for 1h prior fractiona - tion . Equal volumes of fractions were loaded on a SDS - PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting and using Image Quant Software ( n - = 3 , mean ± S . D . ) . Less endogenous Gga2p is membrane - bound in pik1 - 101 cells at both , permissive and restrictive , temperatures compared to wild type . ( C ) Full length Ggap fused to GST ( pAB381 ) was expressed in E . coli , purified and incubated with PIP strip ( Molecular Probes ) . GST - Gga2p fusion protein was detected using a α - GST antibody . GST - Gga2p has the ability to interact directly with phosphoinositides . 72 4 . Discussion 4 . 1 Pik1p – Bmh1 / 2p interaction The transport of proteins from the Golgi to the plasma membrane is disturbed in cells producing too little or too much PI4P at the Golgi [ 34 , 122 , 133 ] . Herein , a direct interaction of the Golgi resident PI 4 - kinase Pik1p and the yeast 14 - 3 - 3 proteins Bmh1p and Bmh2p has been described . The shown interaction depends on the phosphorylation of Pik1p and , in turn , Pik1p phosphorylation correlates with the translocation of Pik1p from the nucleus to the cytoplasm . Interestingly , the binding of Bmh1p and Bmh2p to Pik1p negatively affects membrane transport . Therefore , phosphorylation dependent nucleo - cytoplasmic shuttling of Pik1p might be a mechanism by which PI 4 - kinase function and , as a consequence , PI4P levels are regulated . 4 . 1 . 1 Localization of Pik1p The yeast PI 4 - kinase Pik1p localizes to the Golgi and to a significant degree to the nucleus [ 34 , 121 ] . Now , it has been shown that Pik1p localizes to the nucleolus . Whether Pik1p has a function within the nucleus is not clear . Alternatively , the nuclear localization of phosphoinositide kinases could serve the downregulation of the PI - kinase activity . The phosphoinositide kinase itself could shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm . Such a process could provide a mechanism for rapid up - or downregulation of phosphoinositide levels at the target membrane . Nucleo - cytoplasmic shuttling of kinases , transcription factors and replication factors is a well - described phenomenon and often phosphorylation controls the function of the nuclear lo - calization signal ( NLS ) ( reviewed in [ 250 ] ) . It has recently been published that the yeast PI4P 5 - kinase Mss4p , which converts PI4P to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 on the cell surface , contains a bipartite NLS and shuttles between the nucleus and the plasma membrane [ 107 ] . The 73 mutant allele mss4 - 1 encodes for a protein that localizes to the plasma membrane at the permissive temperature but is restricted to the nucleus upon shift to the non - permissive temperature . As a consequence , the cellular levels of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 are reduced to less than 10 % of the wild type levels [ 107 ] . Therefore , Mss4p kinase activity can be controlled in vivo by nuclear sequestration [ 107 ] . Upon exit from the nucleus , Mss4p is phosphorylated at the plasma membrane by casein kinase 1 ( Yck1 / 2p ) and Mss4p phosphorylation con - tributes to stable plasma membrane localization . A mutant protein of mss4 - 1 , which is restricted to the nucleus at 37˚C , is not phosphorylated [ 107 ] . Interestingly , Pik1p also possesses two putative NLS and it has been previously shown that Pik1p rapidly and re - versibly translocates from the nucleus into the cytoplasm upon block of secretion in sec - mutants [ 34 ] . This relocation is part of the “arrest of secretion response” , a regulatory cir - cuit that signals from the secretory pathway to the nucleus to initiate nuclear reorganiza - tion and ribosomal gene expression upon inhibition of secretion [ 241 ] . In addition , Pik1p is , similar to Mss4p , a phosphoprotein and phosphorylation most likely occurs outside the nucleus . This is supported by the results obtained from the pik1 - 130 mutant allele . At the permissive temperature of 25˚C , Pik1p can be found at the Golgi and in the nucleolus whereas the protein is no longer found in the nucleus at the restrictive temperature of 37˚C when it primarily exists in a phosphorylated form . Thus , phosphorylation of Pik1p , similar to Mss4p , correlates with the exclusion from the nucleus . A possible scenario would be that Pik1p is phosphorylated in the vicinity of the NLS and this in turn masks the NLS . A similar mechanism has been described for the yeast transcription factor Swi5p [ 251 ] . This protein is nuclear in G1 cells but cytoplasmic in S , G2 , and M phase cells . The Swi5p NLS confers cell cycle - dependent nuclear entry . Located within or close to the NLS are three serine residues , mutation of which results in constitutive nuclear en - try . These residues are phosphorylated in a cell cycle - dependent manner in vivo , they are phosphorylated when Swi5p is in the cytoplasm and dephosphorylated when it is in the nucleus . All three serines are phosphorylated by purified CDC28 - dependent H1 kinase activity [ 251 ] . As indicated by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy and subcellular frac - tionation , the binding of the 14 - 3 - 3 proteins Bmh1p and Bmh2p to phosphorylated Pik1p occurs in the cytoplasm . 14 - 3 - 3 proteins have been shown to regulate cellular processes 74 by modulating the localization of downstream proteins . Often , binding of 14 - 3 - 3 proteins sequesters a protein in a distinct compartment and upon release of 14 - 3 - 3 the target pro - tein is able to relocate ( reviewed in [ 252 ] ) . Therefore , binding of Bmh1 / 2p might regulate the subcellular localization of Pik1p . 14 - 3 - 3 binding might mask the NLSs within Pik1p and abolishes Pik1p entry into the nucleus . A scenario could be that Pik1p is phosphory - lated in close vicinity to the NLS and binding of Bmh1 / 2p covers up the NLS . For exam - ple , 14 - 3 - 3 ε controls the nucleo - cytoplasmic shuttling of Cdc25 in Xenopus [ 253 ] . In Cdc25 , the bipartite NLS is flanked by a serine ( S287 ) , which confines binding of 14 - 3 - 3 ε . The binding of 14 - 3 - 3 ε to phosphorylated Cdc25 reduces strongly the interaction of Cdc25 with α - importin [ 253 ] . In addition , a S287A mutant of Cdc25 , which cannot be phosphorylated and in turn cannot bind to 14 - 3 - 3 ε is found exclusively in the nucleus [ 253 ] . Again , this demonstrates that 14 - 3 - 3 binding can abolish the entry into the nucleus . The overexpression of Bmh1p and Bmh2p in pik1 - 101 and pik1 - 120 ( a . k . a pik1 - 83 ) leads to synthetic enhancement of the mutant growth defect . Moreover , overexpres - sion of Bmh1p and Bmh2p in wild type cells causes a pik1 mutant phenocopy concerning the transport of Gap1 * p - GFP to the plasma membrane . Thus , 14 - 3 - 3 proteins might act upstream of Pik1p . The pik1 mutant phenocopy might be caused by reduced levels of PI4P on the Golgi . Since , as mentioned above , 14 - 3 - 3 proteins are known to regulate the localization of target proteins , it is possible that the delivery of Pik1p to Golgi mem - branes is diminished in cells overexpressing Bmh1p and Bmh2p . This would also be a mean to regulate rapidly the activity of Pik1p . However , immunofluorescence micros - copy showed no significant change in Pik1p localization due to Bmh1p or Bmh2p over - expression from a 2 µ plasmid . Nonetheless , minor changes in Pik1p localization would not have been detected by microscopy and these minor changes might already have ef - fects on growth and Gap1 * p - GFP surface delivery . Furthermore , the major pool of the 14 - 3 - 3 proteins can be detected in the cytoplasm , again favoring a situation in which 14 - 3 - 3 binding to Pik1p sequesters Pik1p away from Golgi membranes . Yet , a direct role of Bmh1p and Bmh2p on internal membranes cannot be excluded . It is also possible that Bmh1 / 2 overexpression negatively regulates the interaction of Pik1p with other proteins e . g . cytoskeleton or Golgi proteins . 75 It might be that 14 - 3 - 3 interaction protects Pik1p from dephosphorylation until Pik1p binds to the Golgi . It is possible that , similar to the situation in Mss4p and Vps34p , phosphorylation of Pik1p is required for its localization to the target membrane . Casein kinase 1 , which phosphorylates Mss4p , is localized to the plasma membrane , Vps15p re - quired for the phosphorylation of Vps34p is localized to endosomes [ 68 , 86 , 107 , 254 ] and in both cases , the protein kinase was needed for membrane binding of the PI kinase ( protein kinase / lipid kinase module ) . The identification of the phosphorylation sites within Pik1p and the identification of the kinase responsible for Pik1p phosphorylation would help to gain further under - standing of the Pik1p - 14 - 3 - 3 interaction . For example , knowing the phosphorylation sites could solve the question whether the interaction serves the sequestration from the nucleus or from the Golgi . By mutating these phospho - sites and , subsequently , disrupting the interaction of 14 - 3 - 3 and Pik1p , it would be of interest to observe changes in subcel - lular localization . Perhaps one cellular pool is increasing on the cost of the other . Another experiment along this line would be the incubation of yeast cytosol of wild type cells or cells harboring mutations in the Pik1p phospho - sites with GST - tagged importins . If 14 - 3 - 3 binding masks the NLS less Pik1p will be pull downed from wild type cells relative to the cytosol from mutant cells . Furthermore , knowing the kinase , which phosphorylates Pik1p , and the localization of the kinase would also shed some light on the subcellular localization of phosphorylated Pik1p . 4 . 1 . 2 14 - 3 - 3 proteins in the regulation of membrane traffic Both 14 - 3 - 3 proteins , BMH2 and to a lesser extend BMH1 , show dosage depend - ent growth defect rescue of cells lacking clathrin heavy chain Chc1p . In addition , double deletion mutants of BMH1 or BMH2 with CHC1 are not viable [ 234 ] . These results pro - vided genetic evidence that 14 - 3 - 3 might be involved in vesicular transport . However , the molecular mechanism of this interaction is still elusive . Pik1p itself , like Chc1p , is also involved in the formation of post - Golgi vesicles . Cells harboring a mutation within the catalytic domain of Pik1p display a delay in delivery of CPY to the vacuole and an accu - 76 mulation of Golgi membranes ( Berkeley bodies ) [ 34 ] . Now , Pik1p has been identified as first target of Bmh1p and Bmh2p involved in membrane transport steps at the Golgi . Furthermore , 14 - 3 - 3 proteins interact genetically with pik1 - 101 and pik1 - 120 , many late acting sec - genes as well as mutant alleles of act1 and myo2 . However , no genetic inter - action could be observed between BMH1 / 2 and sec - genes regulating ER - to - Golgi trans - port suggesting that Bmh1 / 2p functions in post - Golgi transport . In contrast to the BMH1 / 2 interaction with chc1 , overexpression of BMH1 or BMH2 did not rescue the growth defect of the mutants but instead an enhancement of the growth defect was visi - ble . Additional proof for the role of 14 - 3 - 3 proteins in secretion comes from the finding that the overexpression of BMH2 or to a lesser extend of BMH1 results in a phenocopy of the inhibition of the transport of Gap1 * p - GFP to the cell surface , again arguing in favor of a negative regulatory mechanism . It has to be mentioned that only a genetic interaction between BMH1 and BMH2 and CHC1 has been demonstrated and that there is no ex - perimental proof of a physical interaction . Another difference is that the N - terminal part of Bmh1 / 2p is interacting with Pik1p whereas the deletion of C - terminal region of Bmh proteins abolishes the rescue of chc1 mutant growth defect [ 234 , 255 ] . This might indi - cate that 14 - 3 - 3 proteins interact through different motifs with target proteins , maybe by this means recruiting two factors required for the formation of secretory vesicles to the same site at the target membrane . It will furthermore be interesting to establish whether the observed genetic interaction between BMH1 / 2 and CHC1 is due to an effect of PI4P production on Chc1p - mediated vesicle formation . In addition , other 14 - 3 - 3 targets than Pik1p at the Golgi should be considered as a possibility . 14 - 3 - 3 proteins have also been found to be involved in exocytosis through the re - arrangement of the actin cytoskeleton [ 238 ] . Overexpression of the C - terminal region of Bmh2p resulted in a failure of polarized vesicular transport indicated by an unpolarized localization of Sec4p [ 238 ] . Moreover , overproduction of the dominant negative allele of Bmh2p disrupted the actin cytoskeleton . However , only polarized secretion seemed to be affected since the secretion of invertase was unaffected . The observed strong genetic in - teractions of BMH1 / 2 with ACT1 and MYO2 are in agreement with the role of Bmh1 / 2p in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton . Also pik1 mutants exhibit strong defects in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and are synthetic lethal with act1 and myo2 [ 34 , 77 122 ] . Thus it is possible that Pik1p and 14 - 3 - 3 together play a role in an actin dependent process at the Golgi exit or in the transport of secretory vesicles . Furthermore , the over - expression of BMH1 / 2 led to enhancement of pik1 - 101 growth defect and pik1 - 101 mu - tant cells show a decrease in the secretion of invertase . The result that dominant - negative Bmh2p has no effect on invertase secretion is in agreement with that [ 238 ] . It would be of interest to see whether BMH2 overproduction in wild type cells also results in a pik1 - 101 phenocopy in respect to invertase secretion . A new role for 14 - 3 - 3 proteins in vesicular transport has been defined and Bmh1 / 2p have been implicated in the regulation of Pik1p . Further investigation of the regulation of Pik1p phosphorylation and links between 14 - 3 - 3 binding to Pik1p and other proteins participating in membrane traffic will likely provide important new information about the formation of secretory vesicles from the TGN . 4 . 2 . Multicopy suppressors of pik1 - 101 The pik1 - 101 mutant protein localizes properly to the Golgi at all temperatures . However , due to a single S1045A point mutation within the catalytic domain the catalytic activity is drastically reduced at both , permissive and restrictive , temperature [ 34 ] . Pro - teins , which upon overproduction partially rescue the growth defect of pik - 101 mutant cells were identified in this study . The isolated suppressors were called ROP s and have been shown to be specific for pik1 alleles having exclusively a mutation within the cata - lytic domain . In addition , overexpression of ROP s is not sufficient to restore growth at 37˚C of the stt4 - 1 mutant allele . Unfortunately , Rop proteins failed to localize to the Golgi and therefore are unlikely to be PI4P binding proteins at this compartment . The suppressors also did not rescue the analyzed pik1 - 101 mutant phenotypes of invertase se - cretion or Golgi morphology . Some of the isolated genes regulate transcription or translation and were localized to the nucleus . At first sight , these genes were ignored as unspecific suppressors of the pik1 - 101 growth defect . However , these proteins might be involved in the nuclear func - 78 tion of Pik1p . For example , Rop2 has been localized to the nucleolus [ 171 ] , which is also the localization of the nuclear pool of Pik1p . Furthermore , recently it has been shown that Elp1p , which is part of the Elongator complex and which copurifies with hyperphosphorylated RNA - polymerase II , plays a role in the regulation of membrane transport [ 256 ] . Elp1p is a suppressor of sec2 - 59 mu - tants , localizes to the cytoplasm and not to actively transcribing genes and regulates negatively polarized secretion . It has been demonstrated that Elp1p is downstream of Ypt31 / 32p but functions upstream of Sec2p and Sec4p [ 256 ] . The pik1 - 101 suppressor screen also isolated a number of cytosolic proteins ( Rop1p , Rop2p , Rop7 - 10p ) . These proteins might also have an indirect effect on Pik1p function and so far not investigated role in secretion . A striking phenotype of pik1 - 101 mutant cells is the accumulation of Golgi mem - branes ( Berkeley bodies ) [ 34 ] . This phenotype together with the delay of CPY maturation indicates that pik1 - 101 mutant cells are defective in vesicle budding from the Golgi . The overexpression of ROP4 , ROP8 and ROP9 did not result in a restoration of the normal , wild type - like Golgi morphology but instead an enhancement of the pik1 phenotype was observed . The Berkeley bodies increased in size and changed from a donut - shaped to a pearls - on - a - string like structure . Although the wild type morphology was not restored the observed Golgi structures might be considered a rescue phenotype since the wild type Golgi also appears as “nodular network” [ 257 , 258 ] . Therefore , the seen structures might be more normal than a Berkeley Body . The Golgi structure indicated that transport carri - ers are formed but the vesicles are unable to bud off the Golgi . It seemed as if the fission machinery at the Golgi is not assembled properly . That suggests that PI4P is directly or indirectly involved in recruiting the machinery for vesicle formation and vesicle fission . Since none of the Rop proteins localized to the Golgi , the multicopy suppressor screen failed to isolate new PI4P binding proteins involved in post - Golgi vesicle forma - tion . Although the isolated genes might be interest for the understanding of Pik1p regula - tion , the identification and characterization of the PI4P dependent Golgi budding machin - ery has been the main goal of this thesis . One might wonder whether the Golgi sorting and budding machinery has not already been entirely identified but previous work might 79 have failed to make the proper connections between the isolated proteins and their in - volvement in membrane transport . 4 . 3 PI4P regulated pathway It has been shown that pik1 mutants have a delayed transport of CPY to the vacu - ole , reduced secretion of invertase and accumulate Golgi membranes [ 34 ] . Therefore , it was long believed that , in analogy to the recruitment of components of clathrin coats in endocytosis , parts of the Golgi budding machinery are recruited by PI4P . In this study , genetic interactions between Pik1p and Gga2p as well as synthetic transport defects ( Gap1 * p - GFP , invertase , Kex2p ) , which indicate an involvement of Pik1p in Golgi - to - endosome transport , are described . In addition , herein it is shown that Gga2p is the first coat component in yeast , which is at least partially recruited to the Golgi by PI4P . 4 . 3 . 1 Genetic interactions Recently , a synthetic genetic array analysis of a conditional pik1 mutant was per - formed [ 129 ] . The used pik1 - 139 mutant allele has point mutations within the catalytic domain . Among the genes , synthetic lethal or sick with pik1 - 139 at 25˚C , ARF1 , YPT31 and DRS2 have been isolated . It has been shown that these proteins , similar to Pik1p , are involved in Golgi exit and the formation of CCVs [ 31 , 32 , 138 , 185 , 259 ] . Furthermore , deletion of DRS2 has been shown to abolish the formation of invertase containing HDSV [ 138 ] , implicating Drs2p in the formation of exocytic vesicles from the Golgi transiting the endosomal system . These results on the one hand confirm already obtained results that pik1 - 101 is synthetic lethal with arf1 ∆ and ypt31 ∆ ypt32ts [ 34 ] and on the other hand show that a synthetic lethal screen for Pik1p has the power to elucidate the machinery for post - Golgi budding . However , it is unclear whether this synthetic lethal screen isolated true effectors of PI4P since none of the isolated proteins contains a PH domain , which is 80 known to interact with PI4P . True PI4P effectors might contain an unidentified PI4P binding module . Besides , the screen used the collection of all viable deletions in yeast and PI4P effectors might be essential proteins . The authors argue themselves that PI4P effectors might also be recognized by other Golgi determinants , e . g . Arf1p . A similar synthetic lethal screen for the pik1 - 101 allele was simultaneously performed in our lab . The screen confirmed the genetic interactions between pik1 mutants and genes involved in retrograde traffic from endosomes to the Golgi . Besides arf1 and ypt31 , a weak syn - thetic sick interaction of pik1 - 101 with gga2 ∆ ( Maike Gravert , personal communication ) . This was in interesting finding as Gga proteins interact physically with Arf1p [ 74 ] and there are also indications for a direct or indirect interaction of Pik1p with Arf1p . Fur - thermore , it has been shown that many PI4P binding proteins require Arf1 for proper Golgi localization [ 105 , 168 ] . Furthermore , pik1 - 101 and gga2 ∆ share similar transport phenotypes ( see below ) . Whereas yeast Gga proteins have been implicated in Golgi - to late endosome transport [ 41 , 66 , 76 ] , the yeast AP - 1 complex has been reported to be in - volved in transport between the Golgi and the early endosome [ 54 , 66 ] . There is strong experimental evidence that AP - 1 is regulating retrograde transport of chitin synthase III Chs3p from the early endosomes to the Golgi [ 54 ] . It has been shown in our study that pik1 - 101 was only synthetic sick with gga2 ∆ but pik1 - 101 was synthetic lethal with the deletion of the AP - 1 subunit ALP4 . Thus , there might be a functional connection of Pik1p and Gga2p in the same pathway and it places Pik1p in a post - Golgi pathway parallel to AP - 1 . It has to be mentioned that further strong synthetic interactions have been discov - ered with genes involved in early endosome - to - Golgi transport such as Ypt6 or Ric1p ( Maike Gravert , personal communication ) . The synthetic lethal interaction of pik1 - 101 with alp4 ∆ was not discovered in the synthetic lethal screen but was found during the evaluation process of the obtained results . This might be explained by the fact that the screen was performed genome wide in a high through - put format . The overexpression of Pik1p is synthetic sick with gga2 ∆ but not with gga1 ∆ ( Christiane Walch - Solimena , personal communication ) . The following scenario might explain the result : Pik1p and Gga2p act in the same pathway . The deletion of Gga2p leads to a block of this specific Golgi exit pathway . Since cargo in yeast can be rerouted into other pathways [ 38 , 39 ] , yeast cells are still viable . The overproduction of Pik1p 81 might force cargo back into the original and by the deletion Gga2p inhibited pathway . Therefore , the secretion of some specific cargo might be abolished or largely diminished leading to the strong genetic interaction . 4 . 3 . 2 Pik1p and Gga2p regulate surface delivery of Gap1 * p - GFP Cargo can leave the Golgi on different routes to the surface . It can be transported directly to the surface . Some plasma membrane proteins can be internalized from the plasma membrane , reach early endosomes and are then recycled back to the Golgi in an AP - 1 dependent manner [ 54 ] . Other cargo proteins might transit the late endosome on their way to the cell surface . Pik1p is synthetic lethal with proteins regulating recycling from the early endosomes but only synthetic sick with genes controlling Golgi - to - late en - dosome transport . Therefore , again , Pik1p might be involved in transport to the late en - dosomes . In previous studies , two routes from the Golgi to the cell surface have been de - scribed [ 38 , 39 ] . A tremendous problem in the field is the poor knowledge of markers of these distinct transport routes . The major plasma membrane ATPase Pma1p has been identified as cargo of the LDSV , which reach the surface on a probably direct pathway . This pathway cannot be inhibited by mutations of the clathrin heavy chain gene CHC1 or by deletion of yeast dynamin Vps1p [ 38 , 39 ] . Both , Chc1p and Vps1p , have been shown to be involved in the transport to the endosomal system . The ( late ) endosomal route to the surface is taken in HDSVs by invertase , a soluble periplasmic protein [ 38 , 39 ] . So far , no transmembrane protein has been reported to utilize this route . The general amino acid permease Gap1p is a transmembrane protein and found at the plasma membrane under poor nitrogen conditions ( e . g . proline ) . If cells are then shifted to better nitrogen condi - tions ( e . g . glutamine ) , Gap1p is mono - ubiquitinated and transported from the surface to the vacuole . In addition , newly synthesized Gap1p is also mono - ubiquitinated at the Golgi and transported to the vacuole in dependence on Gga proteins , which have been shown to bind ubiquitin through their GAT domain . [ 44 - 47 ] . However , the question whether the ubiquitination of Gap1p plays a role for sorting at the Golgi or at a later step 82 on the late endosome is not solved at the moment . The argument has been raised that proteins , which are only required under certain conditions are sorted into HDSV and sorted at an endosome [ 39 ] As described above , Gap1p localization and transport is highly regulated by the external nitrogen source . Thus , Gap1p might be a good candidate transmembrane protein packaged into HDSV that could transit through an endosomal compartment to the surface . Pik1p itself is a good candidate for a protein regulating the HDSV pathway . First , the transport of invertase to the surface is reduced and the delivery of CPY to the vacuole is delayed on the Golgi level in pik1 mutant cells [ 34 ] . Second , the transport of Pma1p - GFP and Mid / Fus - GFP , both proteins following the direct pathway [ 42 , 246 ] , is not af - fected in pik1 - 101 mutant cells . In striking contrast , the transport of Gap1 ( K9K16 ) p - GFP ( Gap1 * p - GFP ) is blocked in pik1 - 101 mutant cells . Although the majority of the protein still reaches the surface , a significant pool , which is not visible in wild type cells , accu - mulates in the Golgi . This mutant cannot be ubiquitinated and , therefore , cannot be sorted to the vacuole and is , independent of the nitrogen source , always transported to the cell surface [ 45 ] . The same specific transport defect is seen in gga2 ∆ and gga1 / 2 ∆ cells . That is the first demonstration that Gga proteins are involved in exocytosis . This suggests that Pik1p and Gga2p control the same Golgi exit pathway in yeast , presumably involving an ( late ) endosomal compartment . Gga proteins are able to bind to ubiquitin directly and have been shown to be re - quired for sorting of ubiquitinated Gap1p from the Golgi to the vacuole . In contrast to the mammalian system , where it is certain that Gga proteins recognize through their VHS domain a DXXLL motif within the cytoplasmic tail of cargo proteins , e . g . the mannose - 6 - phosphate receptor , no such sequence has been identified so far in yeast . Nevertheless , Gap1p contains a DXXLL motif [ 224 ] and it remains to be shown whether yeast Gga proteins recognize that motif . So far , ubiquitin is the only determined signal recognized by yeast Gga proteins . However , ubiquitin binds to the GAT domain [ 47 , 226 ] and , there - fore , it is possible to imagine that yeast proteins sorted and packaged into vesicles by Gga proteins might also have a motif in their cytoplasmic domain which is bound by the VHS domain . The obtained results that gga2 ∆ cells accumulate Gap1 * p - GFP in the Golgi whereas wild type cells properly deliver Gap1 * p - GFP to the surface show on the one 83 hand that Gga proteins are generally involved in Gap1p exit from the Golgi and on the other hand that ubiquitin is not the only motif recognized by yeast Gga proteins . From these the following model is emerging : Gga proteins recognize ubiquitinated cargo des - tined for degradation and exocytic cargo through a so far unknown motif . CCVs are formed and cargo is transported to the endosomal system . The endosome represents in this model a major sorting station . Ubiquitinated cargo is handed over from the endoso - mal clathrin machinery to the ESCRT machinery and sorted to the vacuole . This scenario is supported by data from the mammalian system where it has been demonstrated that GGA3 interacts with the ESCRT - I subunit Vps23 / TSG101 [ 226 ] . Non - ubiquitinated exocytic cargo is tranported by an unknown mechanism to the surface , most likely in HDSV [ 39 ] . However , since the accumulation of Gap1 * p - GFP occurs in the Golgi , yeast Gga protein might only play a minor role on the yeast endosomes . Nevertheless , the obtained results only represent the first step toward the under - standing of post - Golgi transport and sorting in yeast . In the future , it needs to be shown that exocytic cargo really transits via a late endosomal compartment . Towards this goal , more cargo proteins , sharing the assumed Gap1p pathway need to be identified and their route carefully analyzed . Even more importantly , the identity of the machinery sorting cargo at the late endosomes towards the surface is still elusive and needs to be discovered and characterized . In order to clarify , whether Gap1p is transported through a late en - dosomal compartment , wild type , pik1 - 101 and gga1 / 2 ∆ cells expressing Gap1 * p - GFP will be submitted to immuno - EM analysis and the degree of colocalization between Tlg1p ( early endosome ) and Pep12p ( late endosome ) with Gap1 * p - GFP will evaluated . 4 . 3 . 3 Synergistic function of Pik1p and Gga2p in Golgi - to - endosome transport It has been shown that pik1 - 101 mutant cells secrete 20 % less invertase relative to wild type cells . A collaborative function of Pik1p and Gga2p is required for proper in - vertase secretion since pik1 - 101 gga2 ∆ double mutants only release 60 % of invertase into the periplasm . However , the assay is not able to determine the site of accumulation within the cell and it might therefore be that invertase accumulates at the Golgi or at late en - 84 dosomes . The periplasmic enzyme invertase is found in HDSV whose formation is blocked in cells lacking the late endosome t - SNARE Pep12p [ 35 ] . The most straightfor - ward explanation is that invertase transits through the late endosome on its way to the surface . Yet , whether it is transported directly to the late endosome or whether invertase is transported first to an early endosome remains an open question . Nevertheless , further indication that invertase might transit through a late endosomal compartment comes from the observation that Gga proteins regulate Golgi - to - late endosome transport [ 41 ] . This implies that both proteins , Pik1p and Gga2p , function together in the regulation of a Golgi - to - late endosome pathway . The secretion of α - factor can be visualized using the halo assay . Yet , this assay is unable to dissect whether α - factor is simply not properly secreted of whether the proc - essing of pre - α - factor is disturbed because the necessary proteases such as Kex2p are mislocalized to other compartments or because Kex2p is not efficiently transported to the desired compartment . Nonetheless , the lack of a halo indicates a defect in the Golgi - endosomal system . As seen for invertase , Pik1p and Gga2p function synergistically on the secretion of α - factor , placing again both proteins together in a Golgi - to - endosome pathway . It might well be that Pik1p and Gga2p control the exit of Kex2p from the Golgi . It has been demonstrated that Golgi exit of Kex2p and Vps10p is reduced in gga1 / 2 ∆ cells [ 66 ] . Thus , less pre - α - factor is processed resulting in a reduced halo size relative to wild type cells . The halo formation is not completely abolished by pik1 - 101 gga2 ∆ muta - tion . That is in agreement with previous results indicating that AP - 1 is more important for Kex2p exit from the Golgi than Gga proteins whereas Gga proteins more tightly regulate the exit of Vps10p [ 66 ] . It has further been shown that the transport of the vacuolar hydrolase CPY is de - layed in pik1 - 101 cells [ 34 ] . However , pik1 mutant cells do not missort CPY to the sur - face as shown ( data not shown , unpublished data ) , which is different from results ob - tained for gga1 / 2 ∆ cells in which around 40 % of CPY are secreted in a pseudo - mature form [ 74 , 75 , 225 ] . This difference in phenotypes might be explained with different func - tions of Pik1p and Gga proteins in the same process . It might be that Pik1p is involved vesicle formation per se but not in sorting . The Gga adaptor proteins however are able to interact with cargo directly and therefore are required for cargo sorting . This process is in 85 analogy to the situation on early endosomes where PI3P produced by Vps34p recruits the ESCRT machinery , which in turn regulates sorting into MVBs [ 26 ] . Besides sorting cargo , adaptor proteins are implicated in the formation of vesicles . It has been shown that Gga proteins are involved in Golgi exit and that deletion of GGA1 / 2 is able to block the exit of cargo ( Vps10p ) destined for late endosomes [ 66 ] . In agreement with the proposed function of Pik1p in SV formation , pik1 - 101 cells also show a delay in Golgi exit of Vps10p . These new data are also in agreement with the observed CPY transport defect . The artificial marker protein A - ALP and the furin - like protease Kex2p are trans - ported via the early endosome to the late endosome from where A - ALP is sent to the vacuole and Kex2p retrieved to the Golgi . The deletion of the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 5 - phosphatase INP53 has been shown to accelerate Golgi - to - late endosome transport of these two pro - teins . However , delivery of CPY to the vacuole and the retrieval of Vps10p from late en - dosomes to the Golgi are not disturbed [ 72 ] . Interestingly , the deletion of INP53 in a gga1 / 2 ∆ background also results in a synthetic growth defect but the deletion of INP53 in cells already lacking ALP2 has not effect on growth [ 76 ] . Inp53p contains a SacI domain , which has a PI4P 4 - phosphatase activity [ 260 ] . The deletion of INP53 might therefore cause an increase of PI4P on the Golgi and by this mean mimics the phenotype caused by the overexpression of Pik1p in gga1 / 2 ∆ cells . These results place Inp53p in a Golgi - to - early endosome pathway together with AP - 1 . Furthermore , inp53 ∆ gga1 ∆ gga2 ∆ triple mutants show a drastic delay of A - ALP transport to the vacuole [ 76 ] . This suggested that Inp53p and Gga proteins act in parallel pathways . Both , Inp53 and Sac1 , are important for Golgi function and although their relationships to PI kinases are not clear yet , they have been show to regulate intracellular PI4P / PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 pools [ 104 , 261 , 262 ] . It has also been discovered that deletion of the PI4P 4 - phosphatase Sac1p or the overproduction of Pik1p lead to excessive forward transport to the plasma membrane of chitin synthase III Chs3p and subsequent accumulation in the vacuole [ 133 ] . A possible explanation could be that an excess of PI4P disturbs the identity of the yeast endosomal system and Chc3p , which is usually recycled from plasma membrane through the early endosomes to the Golgi , is instead sorted towards the vacuole . Another possible scenario would be that due to the overproduction of PI4P , Chs3p is not transported in its normal direct , Chc5p dependent route to the surface but rather is forced to enter the Pik1p path - 86 way through the late endosome . This non - physiological pathway lacks any kind of regu - latory machinery for Chc3p exit and , therefore , Chs3p is highly transported to the sur - face . 4 . 3 . 4 PI4P contributes to the recruitment of Gga proteins to the Golgi Mammalian ARF1 in its GTP - bound state is required and sufficient to recruit mammalian Gga proteins to the Golgi . An additional prerequisite for the binding of mammalian Gga proteins is the interaction with the DXXLL motif within the cytoplasmic tail of cargo proteins [ 225 ] . However , since ARF1 is a very abundant Golgi protein and the interaction with the cargo tail is very weak the question how Gga proteins are re - cruited to specific sites at the Golgi is still not answered . It has also recently been demon - strated that mammalian AP - 1 requires functional PI4KII α in order to localize to the Golgi [ 175 ] . One proposed model for the action of AP - 1 and Gga proteins in mammalian cells is that both proteins act sequentially . At first , Gga proteins locate to the Golgi due to the action of ARF - GFP . Gga proteins in turn inhibit ARF - GAP function resulting in pro - longed recruitment of ARF to the membranes and in increasing chance to recruit AP - 1 to this membrane site . Gga itself pack cargo and recruit clathrin to the membranes . AP - 1 is associated with casein kinase 2 , which phosphorylates cargo proteins as well as Gga pro - teins leading to the release of Gga proteins from the Golgi and binding of AP - 1 to the cargo [ 176 ] . The in the literature described situation in yeast seems to be completely dif - ferent . First , although yeast Gga proteins bind to Arf1 - GTP , Arf1 function seems to be dispensable for Golgi localization of yeast Gga proteins [ 227 ] . Another striking differ - ence is that all available experimental results indicate that AP - 1 and Gga proteins regulate two different pathways [ 41 , 54 , 76 , 114 , 217 ] or at least are involved in the packaging of different cargos into the same CCV . The last idea is supported by the fact that AP - 1 and Gga proteins co - immunoprecipitate in yeast [ 66 ] . Now , our study provides evidence that Pik1p function is at least partially required for Gga2p localization to the Golgi ( micros - copy , subcellular fractionation ) . Gga2p would therefore be the first coat adaptor recruited by PI4P to the Golgi in yeast . In addition , recombinant GST - Gga2p is able to bind di - 87 rectly to phosphoinositides in vitro ( protein lipid overlay assay ) . Furthermore , the speci - ficity of Gga2p for some phosphoinositides needs to be determined . Until now , Gga2p binds to PI4P and PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 as well as to PI5P , PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , whose existence is not confirmed in budding yeast . It has to be mentioned that in vitro binding to a PIP strip is a good means to identify the ability of a protein to bind to phosphoinositides but provides only limited informations about the specificity . It might for example well be that a protein binds quite well PI5P in vitro but has no tendency to do so in vivo and vice versa [ 170 ] . The result that Gga2p can bind to phosphoinositides directly needs to be con - firmed by pull - down assays using liposomes containing various phosphoinositides . An - other future experiment is to elucidate the contribution of cargo binding to the recruit - ment of Gga2p to membranes . Towards that goal , proteoliposomes containing the puta - tive di - leucine motif of the general aminoacid permease Gap1 and phosphoinositides will be incubated with recombinant GST - Gga2p and analyzed for their ability to bind Gga2p . The VHS domain , which in mammalian Gga proteins binds to di - leucine DXXLL motifs , has a very similar structure to the phosphoinositide binding ENTH domain . This similarity is not detectable with sequence analysis programs . The structural similarity and the fact that proteins containing either domain are involved in membrane trafficking indi - cate that they might have had a common ancestor [ 263 ] . This raises the possibility that yeast Gga proteins interact with PI4P through the VHS domain [ 264 ] . The interaction between phosphoinositide and ENTH domain depends on certain surface residues on the ENTH domain [ 157 ] . But while VHS domain and ENTH domain have a preserved hy - drophobic core , there are variations in the surface residues , maybe causing functional dif - ferences [ 263 ] . In addition , whether the ( yeast ) Gga - VHS domain binds to di - leucine motifs and phosphoinositides or whether binding of a di - leucine motif is mutually exclu - sive has not yet been demonstrated . Another interesting observation is that other VHS domain containing proteins such as Vps27p contain instead of the GAT domain an addi - tional FYVE domain for the interaction with PI3P . This either indicates that ( i ) different VHS domains might have different phosphoinositide specificities or that ( ii ) the VHS domain binds weakly one phosphoinositide before the FYVE domain binds PI3P or that ( iii ) the VHS domain has nothing at all to do with phosphoinositide binding . 88 Gga proteins bind to accessory proteins through their GAE domain [ 159 , 160 , 231 ] . In yeast , Gga2p has been shown to interact with Ent3p and Ent5p in yeast - two - hybrid analysis . Both proteins colocalize with clathrin at the Golgi . While Ent3p has been shown to be associated with Gga2p in vivo , Ent5p coimmunoprecipitates with Gga2p , AP - 1 and clathrin [ 231 ] . Both proteins , Ent3p and Ent5p , contain phosphoinositide - binding modules . Ent3p has an ENTH domain similar to the one found in epsin1 whereas Ent5p has an ANTH domain similar to AP180 . This might indicate that Ent3p and Ent5p fulfill distinct functions at the Golgi [ 231 ] . It might well be that Ent3p is involved in the induction of membrane curvature and that Ent5p , which has two putative clathrin - binding boxes , plays a role in the formation of a clathrin coat . It has been proposed that due to differences in the surface residues responsible for phosphoinositide binding Ent3p and Ent5p bind other phosphoinositides than PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 [ 265 ] . Since Ent3p and Ent5p interact with Gga2 and colocalize with clathrin at the Golgi that phosphoinositide might be PI4P produced Pik1p . The interaction with Ent3p and Ent5p might contribute to proper Golgi localization and Gga proteins might bind directly to PI4P through their VHS domain but might also interact with PI4P via Ent3p or Ent5p . Further support for the idea that Ent3p and Ent5p might be involved in the recruitment of Gga proteins to the Golgi comes from the observation that transport defects observed ent3 / 5 ∆ double mutants are similar to the defects found in gga1 / 2 ∆ mutants [ 231 ] . Moreover , this scenario would also explain why in ent3 / 5 ∆ but not in ent3 ∆ or ent5 ∆ cells the localization of clathrin to the Golgi is dis - turbed . Gga proteins have a clathrin - binding box . If now Gga proteins fail to localize to the yeast Golgi , clathrin is not recruited to the membrane and no clathrin coat can be as - sembled . Besides that hypothetical role on the Golgi , Ent3p and Ent5p are thought to have an additional function as PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 effectors and have been implicated in protein sorting into the MVB pathway [ 99 , 100 ] . In the literature it has been described that yeast GGA localization to membranes does not depend on Arf1 [ 227 ] . We have found evidence that Arf1 might contribute to the localization of Gga2 to membranes ( data not shown , unpublished data ) . It has been shown for the mammalian system that ARF1 function is required by an unknown molecular mechanism for PI4KIII β localization to the Golgi [ 128 ] . If Arf11p would also be impli - cated in Pik1p localization to the Golgi , the recruitment of Pik1p and Gga2p would have 89 a common underlying process . Recruitment of PI4P effectors to the Golgi by PI4P and Arf1 - GTP has also been described for proteins containing PH domains , e . g . FAPPs and OSBPs [ 105 , 168 ] . Thus , interaction with the small GTPase Arf1 and binding to PI4P seems to be a common dual mechanism for transient recruitment of proteins to the Golgi . Alternatively , the reduced binding of Gga2p to membranes might be a result of interfer - ence with the Arf1 cycle . It would be possible that Pik1p or PI4P recruits an Arf1 - GEF to the Golgi and , thus , less Arf1 - GTP is found at the Golgi in pik1 - 101 mutant cells . This scenario would also explain a dependence on Pik1p and Arf1p for in vivo binding of Gga2p to the Golgi . It has for example been shown that the activity of the ARF1 - GEF ARNO on recombinant myristoylated Arf1 is increased on liposomes containing PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 does not affect the activity by changing the conformation but rather is involved in the recruitment of the PH domain containing ARNO to the mem - branes [ 266 , 267 ] . In mammalian cells , FAPP1 and FAPP2 have been identified as PI4P and ARF1 - GTP effectors . Both , PI4P and ARF1 - GTP , are required for proper FAPP localization to the TGN . Overexpression of the PH FAPP1 domain , which competes with other ARF1 ef - fectors for ARF1 binding , impairs the formation of VSV - G transport carriers and thereby blocks direct VSV - G transport from the TGN to the surface [ 168 ] . The closest FAPP ortholog in yeast is oxysterol - binding protein Kes1p / Osh4p , which also binds in a PI4P dependent manner to the Golgi [ 184 ] . However , the involvement of Arf1 in Kes1p local - ization remains to be shown . In addition , the deletion of KES1 or deletion of 6 OSH s ( OSH1 / 2 / 3 / 5 / 6 / 7 ) in combination with at temperature sensitive mutant of kes1 had no striking phenotype in exocytosis or transport to the vacuole [ 183 ] . Thus , the role of Kes1p in membrane transport remains to be determined . 4 . 3 . 5 Involvement in retrograde transport Since it has been shown that pik1 - 101 mutant cells accumulate the plasma mem - brane t - SNARE Snc1 - GFP at an endosomal compartment after Snc1 - GFP has been rein - ternalized from the plasma membrane [ 129 ] , the question arises whether Pik1p plays an additional role on endosomes or in regulating Golgi entry . The observed Snc1p transport 90 phenotype can also be found in gga1 / 2 ∆ cells [ 41 ] . Furthermore , pik1 - 101 has been shown to be synthetic lethal with the deletion of the VFT complex component VPS54 [ 129 ] . The VFT complex is implicated in vesicle tethering during retrograde transport between early endosomes and the Golgi [ 268 ] . The deletion of VPS54 shares some phe - notypes with pik1 mutant cells , e . g . bipolar budding or depolarization of the actin cy - toskeleton [ 34 , 269 ] . Moreover , it has been demonstrated that pik1 - 139 mutant cells are defective in polarized transport of chitin synthase III Chs3p and , similar to Snc1 , are de - fective in Chs3p recycling from chitosomes to the Golgi [ 129 ] . However , the transport of Pma1p ( our study ) or plasma membrane hexose transporter Hxt1p [ 129 ] , which are not recycled from the surface is not disturbed . In addition , since neither PI4P specific PH domains nor Pik1p localize to endosomes it is unlikely that Pik1p / PI4P play a direct role on endosomal compartments . The late endosomal SNARE Pep12p is missorted to the early endosomes in gga1 / 2 ∆ cells [ 41 ] . This might result in endosomal structures , which have lost their iden - tity and , as a consequence , share trades of early and late endosomes . Since Pik1p and Gga2p function in a common pathway , pik1 - 101 mutant cells might also have a disturbed endosomal system . Therefore , the Snc1p recycling phenotype might only be of indirect nature . Although is has not been shown yet that pik1 - 101 cells have endosomes with trades of early and late endosomes , it would also explain why pik1 - 101 cells accumulate FM4 - 64 on the level of endosomes [ 34 ] . It might be that due to the loss of endosome identity the machinery for sorting to the vacuoles is not properly recruited . Alternatively , as a consequence of affected endosome identity , the Golgi might be depleted of important factors , which are required for retrograde transport from early endosomes . A direct role of Pik1p / PI4P in early endosome - to - Golgi transport at the point of entry ( e . g . recruitment of VFT ) cannot be excluded . 91 4 . 3 . 6 Conclusions Figure 30 Pik1p and Gga regulate exocytic transport to the plasma membrane through the late endosome . The transport of Pma1p and of the Mid / Fus fusion protein is not affected in pik1 - 101 cells or gga1 / 2 ∆ cells . However , Pik1p and Gga2p together control Golgi exit of cargo proteins , which reach the plasma mem - brane through a presumably late endosomal compartment . In this scenario , the late endosome represents an additional sorting station , in which cargo is sorted either towards the surface or transported to the vacuole for degradation . Cargoes not affected by Pik1p are in red . In green , Pik1p or Gga dependent transport . Ma - chinery shown for vesicle formation indicated in black . The in this study obtained results indicate that Pik1p functions in the same post - Golgi pathway as Gga2p and in a parallel pathway to AP - 1 . Both , Pik1p and Gga2p , control together transport to the late endosome . Pik1p is upstream of Gga2p and is re - quired for normal Gga2p localization to the Golgi . Similar to what has been shown for Gga proteins , Pik1p is mainly involved in the formation of SVs at the Golgi exit ( Figure 30 ) . 92 5 .

The replacement was achieved by homologues recombination after co - transformation of PCR - product and linearized vector pGBKT7 in yeast strain AH109 and gave rise to plasmid pMBL31 ( in analogy to [ 233 ] ) , that was verified by DNA sequencing . For plate overlay assay for detection of α - or β - galactosidase , low melting point agarose was melted in Z - buffer ( 60 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 40 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 10 mM KCl ; 1 mM MgSO 4 , pH 7 . 0 ) to 0 . 5 % , then 0 . 1 % SDS , 38 mM β - mercaptoethanol , 0 . 03 % X - Gal ( for LacZ ) or 0 . 02 % X - aGal ( for Mel1p ) were added . Colonies were overlaid and agarose was allowed to solidify . Plates were then kept at 30°C for color development under visual in - spection . For measurement of β - galactosidase activity in liquid cultures , cells from 1 . 5 ml mid - log phase culture were harvested , washed with Z - buffer and resuspended in 300 µ l of Z - buffer . 100 µ l of the suspension was subjected to 3 freeze / thaw cycles in liquid nitrogen and a 37°C water bath . 0 . 7 ml of Z - buffer with β - mercaptoethanol ( 0 . 27 ml / 100ml ) and 107 160 µ l of o - nitrophenyl - β - D - galactopyranoside ( ONPG ) ( 4 mg / ml in Z - buffer ) were added to the reaction and blank ( 100 µ l of Z - buffer ) tubes . After development of the yel - low color at 30°C , 0 . 4 ml of 1 M Na 2 CO 3 was added and the elapsed time was recorded . After centrifugation ( 10 min ; 14 , 000 rpm ) , supernatants were transferred into cuvettes and measured against the blank at 420 nm . β - galactosidase units were calculated [ 275 , 276 ] : € β− Galactosidase units = 1000 ⋅ OD 420 t ⋅ V ⋅ OD 600 [ 277 ] t = elapsed time of incubation [ min ] , V = 0 . 1 ml x concentration factor , OD 600 of culture 5 . 2 . 3 Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy Cells of a 40 ml yeast culture with an OD 600 of 0 . 6 – 1 . 0 were fixed in 50 ml Fal - con tubes containing 5 ml 1 M K - phosphate pH 6 . 5 and 5 ml 37 % formaldehyde . The suspension was rotated on a nutator for 20 min at RT , harvested ( 3000 rpm , 5 min ) and resuspended in 10 ml of freshly prepared and filtered 4 % paraformaldehyde solution ( 4 % PFA , 42 mM NaOH , 1 . 36 g / 100ml KH 2 PO 4 , 1 mM MgCl 2 ) .

Fractions were quantified using the Image Quant Software . 5 . 2 . 9 Multicopy suppressor screen Yeasts harboring a pik1 - 101 mutation ( CSY215 ) were transformed with a YEp24 - genomic DNA library . Transformants were grown at the permissive temperature of 25˚C and then replicated onto SC - URA plates . Plates were incubated at 25˚C , 34˚C and 37˚C . Colonies , which were able to grow at higher temperatures , were of special interest be - cause they contain suppressors of the pik1 - 101 growth defect . From these yeasts , plas - mids were isolated , amplified in E . coli and sequenced . In addition , to test for plasmid de - pendence of the growth rescue , colonies were replicated on 5’FOA plates . On these plates , yeast cells are forced to lose the plasmid and , therefore , lose the ability to grow at restrictive temperatures if it is plasmid - dependent . Since the genomic DNA fragments of the library contain 3 - 8 ORFs and in order to narrow down the list of putative suppressors , 113 simple deletions of ORFs were performed and created plasmids transformed in pik1 - 101 mutants . After this procedure , the remaining putative pik1 - 101 suppressors were cloned with their endogenous promoter and terminator into pRS426 ( 2 µ , URA3 ) . The obtained plasmids were transformed in pik1 - 101 mutants and tested for growth at restrictive tem - peratures . 5 . 2 . 10 Electron Microscopy A 50ml YPD culture was grown overnight to mid log - phase . 10 ODu were harvested on a 0 . 45 µ m Millipore filter apparatus , washed with 10ml 0 . 1M cacodylate and resuspended in 10ml 0 . 1M cacodylate buffer containing 3 % glutaraldehyde .
