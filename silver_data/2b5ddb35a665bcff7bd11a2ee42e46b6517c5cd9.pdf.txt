Phagocytosis is triggered by particle binding to cell surface receptors , which signal to activate morphologi - cal changes that lead to particle internalization 3 , 4 . α M β 2 integrin , also known as complement receptor ( CR ) 3 , is highly expressed in macrophages , is the main receptor for many pathogens and medi - ates clearance of apoptotic and certain cancer cells 5 , 6 . CR - mediated phagocytosis involves deposition of serum complement C3b on the particle surface , also called opsonization , and its cleavage into iC3b , which is a specific ligand for α M β 2 integrins 7 , 8 . CR - mediated phagocytosis is thought to require active reorga - nization of the actin cytoskeleton . It is inhibited by pharmacologi - cal disruption of the cytoskeleton 9 , requires Arp2 / 3 10 , 11 , the formin mDia1 12 and the GTPase RhoA 13 . However , how actin dynamics are spatially and temporally orchestrated to mediate particle internal - ization is not known . Early electron microscopy studies suggested that , while Fc receptor - mediated phagocytosis involved ruffle - like pseudopods that reach out from the cell surface and wrap around target particles , complement - opsonized targets appeared to sink into the macrophage cytoplasm without involvement of membrane extensions 14 , 15 . How actin regulatory proteins control cytoskeletal dynamics to facilitate CR - mediated ‘sinking phagocytosis’ is unclear . In addition to phagocytosis , integrins also mediate mesenchy - mal cell migration , where integrin activation , adhesion and traction force are driven by actin dynamics 16 , 17 . Whether actin plays a simi - lar role in CR - mediated phagocytosis is unknown . During migra - tion , Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization pushes against the leading edge plasma membrane , generating forces that drive actin ‘flow’ towards the cell interior 18 , 19 . Formation of a linkage between integrins and actin filaments activates integrin to bind ligand and anchors the flowing actin , slowing its rearward motion . Continued assembly of anchored filaments drives forward protrusion of the cell edge and force transmission to integrins , generating traction forces on the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) 20 – 22 . As integrin cytoplasmic tails cannot bind directly to actin filaments , coupling integrin to actin is mediated indirectly by integrin - and actin - binding proteins in focal adhesions ( FAs ) that form a so - called ‘molecular clutch’ 16 . Talin , which binds and activates integrins by its head piece 23 and has actin binding sites in its rod domain 24 , forms a force - transmit - ting link between integrins and actin during cell migration 25 , and is required for CR - mediated phagocytosis 26 . In addition , force across talin unveils vinculin binding sites 27 , which , in conjunction with FAK - mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin , promote vin - culin binding to talin and actin , reinforcing the link between inte - grins , talin and actin at FAs 28 – 30 . Paxillin and vinculin association with phagosomes has been observed during Fc - and CR - mediated phagocytosis 14 , and Syk and the FAK - related tyrosine kinase Pyk2 may function in CR - mediated phagocytosis 31 , 32 , suggesting that mechanical coupling of CR to actin by a similar molecular clutch might mediate phagocytosis . In mesenchymal cells , the FA molecular clutch is sensitive to ECM stiffness 33 – 35 , which regulates decisions driving growth , death , differentiation and migration 36 – 38 . In the context of phago - cytosis , target stiffness varies enormously , ranging from low kPa for mammalian cells 39 to hundreds of MPa for bacteria and fungi 40 , 41 . In addition , apoptosis 42 , 43 and transformation to malignancy 44 are associated with changes in cell stiffness . Thus , CR could render phagocytosis sensitive to the mechanical properties of the tar - gets , which would have important implications for discrimination between microbes and living , dead and transformed cells . Here , we have tested the hypothesis that α M β 2 integrin - mediated phagocytosis by macrophages involves an indirect linkage between actin and integrins , analogous to the molecular clutch characterized in migrating mesenchymal cells . We present evidence that a talin / vinculin - based molecular clutch mechanically couples the forces generated by Arp2 / 3 - and Dia1 - mediated actin polymerization to complement - engaged integrins during phagosome formation , promoting fast membrane protrusion around stiff targets . Coupling of β 2 integrins to actin by a mechanosensi­ tive molecular clutch drives complement receptor­mediated phagocytosis Valentin Jaumouillé 1 , Alexander X . Cartagena­Rivera 2 and Clare M . Waterman 1 * α M β 2 integrin ( complement receptor 3 ) is a major receptor for phagocytosis in macrophages . In other contexts , integrins’ activi - ties and functions are mechanically linked to actin dynamics through focal adhesions . We asked whether mechanical coupling of α M β 2 integrin to the actin cytoskeleton mediates phagocytosis . We found that particle internalization was driven by forma - tion of Arp2 / 3 and formin - dependent actin protrusions that wrapped around the particle . Focal complex - like adhesions formed in the phagocytic cup that contained β 2 integrins , focal adhesion proteins and tyrosine kinases . Perturbation of talin and Syk demonstrated that a talin - dependent link between integrin and actin and Syk - mediated recruitment of vinculin enable force transmission to target particles and promote phagocytosis . Altering target mechanical properties demonstrated more efficient phagocytosis of stiffer targets . Thus , macrophages use tyrosine kinase signalling to build a mechanosensitive , talin - and vincu - lin - mediated , focal adhesion - like molecular clutch , which couples integrins to cytoskeletal forces to drive particle engulfment .

To gain insight into the role of the actin cytoskeleton in CR - mediated phagocytosis , we imaged actin dynamics during particle uptake . β 2 integrins were activated with phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ( PMA ) in RAW 264 . 7 mac - rophages expressing F - tractin - EGFP ( enhanced green fluorescent protein ) , a fluorescent probe for actin filaments 45 . Macrophages were exposed to iC3b - opsonized microspheres and their internal - ization was followed by time - lapse confocal microscopy . Videos revealed that contact between the cell and particle induced for - mation of actin - filled protrusions that rapidly advanced along the particle surface ( Fig . 1a and Supplementary Video 1 ) . After full sur - rounding of the particle by actin protrusions , the particle was pro - pelled inwards by the curved actin cortex flattening ( Fig . 1a , upper panel ) or a burst of actin polymerization between the internalized phagosome and the plasma membrane ( Fig . 1a , lower panel ) . Once internalized , intermittent bursts of actin assembly occurred on the phagosome , as previously observed 46 . Similar actin protrusions around particles were seen in F - tractin - EGFP - expressing RAW macrophages phagocytosing serum - opso - nized zymosan A ( a yeast cell wall particulate preparation that engages α M β 247 , 48 ; Fig . 1b and Supplementary Video 1 ) or comple - ment - opsonized sheep red blood cells ( sRBCs ; Supplementary Video 1 ) , as well as in LifeAct - EGFP - expressing mouse bone mar - row - derived macrophages or F - tractin - EGFP - expressing human THP - 1 macrophages phagocytosing iC3b - opsonized microspheres ( Fig . 1e and Extended Data Fig . 1a ) . The integrin dependence of this process was verified by incubating PMA - activated macro - phages with α M or β 2 integrin blocking antibodies , which reduced binding and internalization of iC3b - opsonized microspheres , com - plement - opsonized native or glutaraldehyde - fixed sRBCs , or zymo - san ( Extended Data Fig . 1b – e ) . Lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , which activates α M β 249 , also promoted internalization of iC3b - opsonized microspheres or complement - opsonized sRBCs via similar actin protrusion dynamics ( Extended Data Fig . 1b – e and Supplementary Videos 1 and 2 ) . Thus , α M β 2 engagement induces actin - based pro - trusions that reach out and surround target particles . A further prediction of a reaching mechanism is that protru - sions should emanate before the particle is pulled towards the cell interior , while in a sinking mechanism , movement of the particle towards the cell interior should precede internalization . The tim - ing of internalization relative to inward movement was determined from kymographs along the axis of particle displacement in videos of F - tractin - GFP - expressing RAW macrophages during phago - cytosis of serum - opsonized zymosan . This revealed that actin - filled protrusions extended to the distal side of the particle before the particle moved towards the cell interior ( Fig . 1c ) . In addition , three - dimensional ( 3D ) confocal imaging of the plasma membrane marker CAAX - EGFP showed that membrane protrusions emanated from the cell surface after particle binding and wrapped around and fully internalized the target particle before its inward movement ( Fig . 1d and Supplementary Video 3 ) . These protrusions were dis - tinct from the previously described ruffles that grab particles before uptake 50 . Together , these results show that CR - mediated phagocy - tosis involves a reaching mechanism in which actin - based protru - sions extend along a target particle surface to mediate phagosome formation , and that particles are actively driven to the cell interior by cortical actin dynamics . Arp2 / 3 and mDia1 contribute to specific aspects of actin dynam - ics during CR - mediated phagocytosis . We next sought to delineate the mechanism of actin assembly in phagocytosis . Pharmacological inhibition of Arp2 / 3 with CK - 666 51 or formins with SMIFH2 52 sig - nificantly reduced the phagocytosis efficiency of iC3b - opsonized microspheres ( Fig . 2a ) . Treatment with CK - 666 together with SMIFH2 further reduced phagocytosis efficiency , suggesting that Arp2 / 3 and formins play distinct roles in phagosome formation . Confocal imaging of F - tractin - mCherry revealed , for the small fraction of successful phagocytic events , that CK - 666 treatment blocked cell surface ruffling , with most particles making contact with non - ruffled regions of the cell . Once contacted , particles formed a hemispherical divot in the cell surface , followed by forma - tion of a thin actin - filled protrusion that advanced along the par - ticle surface to internalize it ( Fig . 2b and Supplementary Video 3 ) , and bursts of actin driving phagosome movement were absent . In contrast , SMIFH2 treatment caused excessive ruffling over the entire cell surface , which mediated contact with particles . Although cell surface ruffles were not tightly coupled to the particle surface , they eventually did envelope and internalize particles ( Fig . 2b and Supplementary Video 4 ) . Thus , Arp2 / 3 drives particle capture by ruffles , initiation of the phagocytic cup and phagosome movement , while formins couple actin protrusions to the particle surface . We next examined how Arp2 / 3 and formins coordinate actin dynamics during phagocytosis . We co - expressed mCherry - F - tractin together with either mEmerald - ArpC2 ( as a marker of the Arp2 / 3 complex ) or mEmerald - tagged mDia1 or mDia2 ( as markers of the formins that have been previously implicated in CR - mediated phagocytosis ) 12 . Time - lapse confocal videos showed that ArpC2 and mDia1 were enriched at the cell – particle contact and during phagosome formation , whereas mDia2 was not ( Fig . 2c , Extended Data Fig . 2 and Supplementary Video 5 ) . ArpC2 filled protrusions as they advanced along the particle surface and concentrated in actin bursts that propelled phagosomes inwards . In contrast , mDia1 only extended part way around the particles from the contact site during the initial phase of protrusion advance , but filled the cup Fig . 2 | Arp2 / 3 and mDia1 contribute to specific aspects of actin dynamics during CR­mediated phagocytosis . a , Percent of bound particles that were internalized after perturbation of Arp2 / 3 , formins , myosin II and Rho - associated kinase ( ROCK ) .

To deter - mine their respective recruitment kinetics , we measured ArpC2 or mDia1 and F - tractin fluorescence intensities in a region surround - ing the particle over time ( Fig . 2c , bottom left and centre ) . This showed that ArpC2 was recruited concomitantly with F - tractin and reached its maximum ~ 5 s before the peak in F - tractin intensity . In contrast , the intensity of mDia1 increased more slowly than that of F - tractin , reaching its maximum and remaining stable 15 s after the F - tractin peak . This was supported by temporal cross - corre - lation analysis , which showed a higher correlation coefficient for ArpC2 and F - tractin intensities than for mDia1 and F - tractin inten - sities ( Fig . 2c , bottom right ) , suggesting that Arp2 / 3 may be the primary driver of actin assembly in the phagocytic cup .

Super - resolution structured illumination TIRF microscopy ( TIRF - SIM ) of fixed frustrated cups stained with fluorescent phalloidin revealed a dense actin network within a few micrometres from the leading edge , similar to the network formed by Arp2 / 3 in lamellipo - dia 18 ( Fig . 4b and Supplementary Video 8 ) .

NAtuRe Cell Biology | VOL 21 | NOVEMBER 2019 | 1357 – 1369 | www . nature . com / naturecellbiology 1362 Articles NATurE CEll BIoloGy suggest that Arp2 / 3 - mediated polymerization drives the leading edge of protrusions to mediate target capture and phagocytic cup formation and also propels phagosomes into the cell interior after internalization , whereas mDia1 follows Arp2 / 3 in the phagocytic cup to mediate actin assembly that couples advancing protrusions to the particle surface . Two distinct actin networks are differentially coupled to the target particle to drive protrusion of the phagocytic cup . Actin polymerization at the leading edge of a migrating cell can drive either retrograde flow of the cytoskeleton within the cell or , if cou - pled through an integrin - mediated molecular clutch to the extracel - lular substrate , can drive leading edge protrusion 16 . To determine if similar actin dynamics mediate phagocytosis , we employed con - focal fluorescent speckle microscopy ( FSM ) 56 of actin dynamics in RAW macrophages expressing actin - mEos3 . 2 by photoswitching at a low rate during phagocytosis of iC3b - opsonized microspheres . Automated detection and tracking 57 revealed that fluorescent actin speckles appeared sequentially at the advancing tip of the phagocytic cup at about the same rate as leading edge protrusion , and , after appearance , remained nearly immobile relative to the particle and did not undergo retrograde flow along the particle surface ( Fig . 3a and Supplementary Video 9 ) . This suggests that actin assembly at the leading edge of the phagocytic cup drives protrusion without retrograde flow . To rule out the possibility of flow off - axis to the con - focal imaging plane , we analysed actin dynamics in flat phagocytic cups during frustrated phagocytosis . Time - lapse TIRF - SIM imaging of F - tractin - EGFP showed that , shortly after coverslip attachment , the peripheral lamellipodium - like zone and more proximal lamella - like zone expanded outward until the cell reached a maximal spread area ( Fig . 3b and Supplementary Video 8 ) . Kymographs perpen - dicular to the cell edge revealed cup protrusion of 6 ± 0 . 7 µ m min − 1 , with slow actin retrograde flow ( 0 . 6 ± 0 . 1 µ m min − 1 ) occurring in the lamellipodia - like zone , together indicating an actin network assembly rate of ~ 6 . 6 µ m min − 1 ( sum of protrusion and retrograde flow ; Fig . 3c ) . In contrast to the flow in the periphery , retrograde flow was virtually absent in the lamella - like zone ( Fig . 3c ) . To test whether α M β 2 integrin engagement was required to couple actin to the substrate , we analysed actin dynamics in macrophages spread on poly - l - lysine to allow adhesion without integrin engagement .

Together , these results indicate that polymerization of two distinct actin networks are differentially coupled by α M β 2 - mediated adhe - sion to complement - opsonized target particles to drive protrusion of the phagocytic cup : a peripheral , Arp2 / 3 - mediated network that is partially coupled to the particle surface and a more proximal , mDia1 - generated network that is fully particle - coupled . β 2 integrins mediate the formation of focal complex - like signal - ling platforms at the phagosome . We next sought to determine if complement - engaged integrins were coupled to actin by an FA - like molecular clutch . We first immunolocalized FA structural and signal - ling proteins in RAW macrophages that were fixed after 5 min incuba - tion with iC3b - opsonized microspheres . Confocal imaging revealed patches on the phagosome surface of vinculin , α - actinin and zyxin , actin - associated proteins typically found in FAs and podosomes 58 ( Fig . 4a ) . Moreover , phospho - tyrosine , phospho - FAK ( tyrosine 397 ) , phospho - paxillin ( tyrosines 31 and 118 ) and phospho - Syk ( tyrosine 342 ) were all enriched in patches on phagosomes , indicative of active integrin signalling ( Fig . 4a , b ) . To better characterize the structure and dynamics of adhesions in the phagocytic cup , we imaged frus - trated phagocytic cups by TIRF - SIM . Localization of actin and phos - pho - paxillin in fixed cells showed near - diffraction - limited puncta lacking actin enrichment that were sparsely distributed throughout the cup ( Fig . 4b ) , similar to focal complexes formed by macrophages adhered to ECM 59 . Lack of localization of expressed ArpC2 - mCherry to such puncta ( Fig . 2d and Supplementary Video 6 ) confirmed they were not podosomes 58 , 60 . Analysis of paxillin - mEmerald dynamics by time - lapse TIRF microscopy showed that puncta formed a microme - tre or so behind the leading edge and remained stable throughout spreading ( Fig . 4c and Supplementary Video 11 ) . Co - expression of untagged α M integrin , EYFP - β 2 integrin and mApple - paxillin showed that paxillin puncta were enriched in β 2 integrin , confirming they were sites of integrin engagement ( Fig . 4d and Supplementary Video 12 ) . This demonstrates that phagocytosis is mediated by discrete inte - grin adhesions that bear the composition , signalling , morphological and dynamic characteristics of focal complexes . Mechanical coupling of integrins to the actin cytoskeleton by talin enhances particle engulfment . We next sought to examine the transmission of actin - generated forces to complement - engaged integrins during phagocytosis . We characterized the stresses exerted by RAW macrophages on a phagocytic target by performing time - lapse traction force microscopy ( TFM ) 61 on fiducial - marked polyacrylamide gels functionalized with anti - α M integrin antibody during frustrated phagocytosis ( Fig . 5a ) . This showed that the force increased during the expansion of the phagocytic cup and peaked as the cell reached its maximal spread area ( Fig . 5b ) . After spread - ing , stresses fluctuated throughout the cup with an average peak of 58 . 8 ± 5 . 3 Pa ( Fig . 5c and Supplementary Video 13 ) . The high - est stresses localized to the periphery of the cup and were directed towards the centre , where stresses were below the detection limit ( Fig . 5a ) . Together with our observations of actin dynamics above , this shows that the direction of traction stresses correlates with the direction of actin flow within the phagocytic cup . We then probed the molecular mechanism of force transmission to the phagocytic target . Talin forms a force - bearing link between integrin and actin in migrating cells , and over - expression of its head domain disrupts this link 25 . Analysis of macrophages over - express - ing talin head - mEmerald in the frustrated phagocytosis TFM assay showed a 71 % reduction of traction stresses compared to control ( Fig . 5a – c and Supplementary Video 13 ) . In a phagocytosis assay , over - expression of full - length talin significantly increased particle binding and internalization , in agreement with its known effects on integrin activation 23 . In contrast , talin head over - expression had no effect on binding , but significantly reduced particle internalization ( Fig . 5d , e and Supplementary Video 14 ) . Thus , a talin - mediated linkage between integrin and actin is required for force generation on target particles and efficient internalization . Syk kinase activity is required for vinculin recruitment and strengthening force transmission for optimal particle uptake . We next sought to test whether tyrosine kinases or ROCK - mediated myosin II activity promote molecular clutch reinforcement in phago - cytosis , as shown for FAs in cell migration 29 , 62 . Pharmacological inhibition showed that phagocytosis efficiency of iC3b - opsonized microspheres was strongly reduced by treatment with either the Syk inhibitor piceatannol 63 or the Src - family kinase inhibitor PP2 64 , with weaker albeit significant reduction by the FAK / Pyk2 inhibitor TAE226 65 ( Fig . 6a ) . Combined treatment with the three inhibitors abolished microsphere internalization almost entirely , suggesting that the tyrosine kinases have non - redundant functions . In contrast , inhibition of myosin II with blebbistatin 66 or ROCK with Y - 27632 67 did not significantly affect phagocytosis efficiency , indicating that myosin II - mediated contractility was not required for particle inter - nalization ( Fig . 6b ) . We next examined the role of tyrosine kinases and contractility in the regulation of vinculin . In migrating cells , Src - and FAK - mediated phosphorylation of paxillin and ROCK - mediated myosin II activ - ity promote vinculin recruitment to FAs 29 , where vinculin engages Fig . 6 | Syk kinase activity is required for vinculin­mediated clutch reinforcement and optimal particle uptake . a , b , e , Phagocytosis efficiency in RAW macrophages upon treatment with DMSO ( control , n = 60 fields , from six independent experiments ) , PP2 ( 20 µ M , n = 30 fields , from three experiments ) , piceatannol ( 50 µ M , n = 40 fields , from four experiments ) , TAE226 ( 5 µ M , n = 44 fields , from five experiments ) or the three inhibitors combined ( 3YKi ) ( n = 29 fields , from three experiments ) ( a ) , upon treatment with DMSO ( control , n = 43 fields ) , blebbistatin ( 50 µ M , n = 36 fields ) or Y - 27632 ( 10 µ M , n = 40 fields , from five independent experiments ) ( b ) or after siRNA knockdown of Syk or vinculin ( n = 30 fields from three experiments ) ( e ) . c , Time - lapse images of vinculin concentration relative to a soluble marker during phagocytosis of iC3b - opsonized microspheres by macrophages treated with DMSO ( control , upper row ) , Y - 27632 ( 10 µ M ) or piceatannol ( 50 µ M ) .

We quantified the effects of perturbations on vinculin recruitment to phagosomes by ratiometric imaging of vinculin - mEmerald and sol - uble FusionRed protein ( enabling correction for volume effects 68 ) . This showed that Syk inhibition abolished vinculin recruitment to puncta on the phagosome , Src or FAK / Pyk2 inhibition caused partial reduction , while ROCK inhibition had no significant effect ( Fig . 6c – e and Supplementary Video 15 ) . We confirmed the role of Syk and vinculin in phagocytosis by siRNA silencing , with each found to significantly decrease phagocytosis efficiency ( Fig . 6f ) . We then assessed whether Syk activity was important for force transmission to integrins . TFM analysis of frustrated phagocytosis showed that treatment with piceatannol significantly reduced the traction force ( Fig . 6g , h and Supplementary Video 13 ) . Together , these results indicate that multiple families of tyrosine kinases con - tribute to CR - mediated phagocytosis , but Syk activity specifically promotes vinculin recruitment to the phagosome , enhances force transmission to the target particle and increases particle uptake . c a f Vinculin S c r a m b l e s i R N A V c l s i R N A GAPDH b h 5 µ m 5 µ m T r a c t i on m agn i t ude ( P a ) Untreated F - t r a c t i n - E G F P Piceatannol 100 80 60 40 20 0 100 80 60 40 20 0 d P = 0 . 0006 0 500 1 , 000 1 , 500 2 , 000 2 , 500 3 , 000 3 , 500 – 4 – 2 0 2 4 V i n c u li n r e c r u i t m en t ( i n t eg r a t ed i n t en s i t y ) Time relative to vinculin peak ( min ) Control Piceatannol Y - 27632 0 50 100 150 T r a c t i on s t r e ss ( P a ) 5 µ m P = 0 . 002 P = 0 . 003 Max Mean Control Piceatannol Syk S c r a m b l e s i R N A S yk s i R N A GAPDH P = 0 . 002 P < 0 . 0001 P < 0 . 0001 P < 0 . 0001 g 5 µ m 5 µ m 5 µ m 0 s 120 s 240 s 360 s C on t r o l Y - 27632 P i c ea t anno l 0 s 120 s 240 s 360 s 0 s 120 s 240 s 360 s e D M S O P P 2 P i c ea t anno l T A E 226 Y - 27632 0 20 40 60 80 100 V i n c u li n r e c r u i t m en t ( % ) P = 0 . 1515 P < 0 . 0001 P = 0 . 0007 P = 0 . 0003 Control PP2 Piceatannol TAE226 3YKi 0 20 40 60 80 100 P hago cy t o s i s e ff i c i en cy ( % ) P hago cy t o s i s e ff i c i en cy ( % ) Control Blebbistatin Y - 27632 0 20 40 60 80 100 Scramble Syk Vinculin 0 20 40 60 80 P hago cy t o s i s e ff i c i en cy ( % ) P = 0 . 0029 P = 0 . 5276 P = 0 . 0631 98 64 50 36 9850 36 148 4 3 2 0 – 1 4 3 2 0 – 1 4 3 2 0 – 1 NAtuRe Cell Biology | VOL 21 | NOVEMBER 2019 | 1357 – 1369 | www . nature . com / naturecellbiology 1365 Articles NATurE CEll BIoloGy a c b P = 0 . 0005 P = 0 . 445 P = 0 . 0003 P = 0 . 398 P = 0 . 5415 P = 0 . 1419 5 µ m 5 µ m 5 µ m 0 s 30 s 60 s 90 s 120 s 150 s 180 s 0 s 30 s 60 s 90 s 120 s 150 s 180 s 0 s 30 s 60 s 90 s 120 s 150 s 180 s 0 . 4 k P a 4 k P a 30 k P a 0 . 4 kPa 4 kPa 30 kPa 0 200 400 600 800 1 , 000 M a x i m u m s u r f a c e a r ea ( µ m 2 ) 0 . 4 kPa 4 kPa 30 kPa 0 1 2 3 4 5 Lead i ng edge v e l o c i t y ( µ m m i n – 1 ) d e P < 0 . 0001 P < 0 . 0001 P < 0 . 0001 P = 0 . 2255 P = 0 . 0039 0 . 1 1 10 100 1 , 000 E l a s t i c m odu l u s ( k P a ) U n t r ea t ed U n t r ea t ed F i x ed F i x ed U n t r ea t ed + b l ebb i s t a t i n F i x ed + b l ebb i s t a t i n 0 20 40 60 80 100 P ha go cy t o s i s e ff i c i en cy ( % ) Fig . 7 | Molecular clutch­mediated mechanosensing regulates phagocytosis . a , Representative spinning disk confocal images of RAW macrophages expressing F - tractin - EGFP , from time - lapse videos of frustrated phagocytosis on anti - α M β 2 - coated 0 . 4 kPa , 4 kPa and 30 kPa polyacrylamide gel substrates . b , Quantification of the velocity of the edge of the phagocytic cup determined from videos of frustrated phagocytosis of RAW macrophages on anti - α M β 2 - coated 0 . 4 kPa ( n = 10 cells ) , 4 kPa ( n = 20 cells ) and 30 kPa ( n = 20 cells ) polyacrylamide gel substrates . c , Quantification of the phagocytic cup maximum surface area determined from videos of frustrated phagocytosis of RAW macrophages on anti - α M β 2 - coated 0 . 4 kPa ( n = 30 cells ) , 4 kPa ( n = 30 cells ) and 30 kPa ( n = 14 cells ) polyacrylamide gel substrates . d , Elastic moduli determined by AFM of complement - opsonized untreated sRBCs ( n = 66 cells ) or sRBCs fixed with 0 . 05 % glutaraldehyde for 1 min ( n = 29 cells ) . e , Percent of bound complement - opsonized untreated sRBCs ( circles ) or sRBCs fixed with 0 . 05 % glutaraldehyde ( triangles ) that were internalized by RAW macrophages in the absence ( orange ) or presence of 50 µ M blebbistatin ( green ) ( n = 30 fields from three independent experiments ) .

NAtuRe Cell Biology | VOL 21 | NOVEMBER 2019 | 1357 – 1369 | www . nature . com / naturecellbiology 1366 Articles NATurE CEll BIoloGy CR - mediated phagocytosis is mechanosensitive . We finally sought to determine whether CR - dependent phagocytosis was mechanosensitive . We first analysed the response of macrophages to ligand - coated polyacrylamide gels of different stiffness during frustrated phagocytosis . We found that cells formed a phagocytic cup on gel stiffnesses above 0 . 4 kPa ( Fig . 7a and Supplementary Video 16 ) . Kymograph analysis showed that , after plating , the initial velocity of leading edge protrusion increased directly with gel stiff - ness ( Fig . 7b ) , whereas the final spread area was unaffected ( Fig . 7c ) . To determine if differences in cup formation in response to changes in target stiffness during frustrated phagocytosis translated to changes in phagocytosis , we altered sRBC stiffness by treatment with glutaraldehyde . Measurements by atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) showed that 50 mM glutaraldehyde treatment for 1 min increased the elastic modulus of sRBCs by nearly 10 - fold ( from 2 . 8 ± 0 . 2 kPa to 242 . 6 ± 27 . 6 kPa ; Fig . 7d ) . Phagocytosis assays showed that while untreated sRBCs were modestly internalized ( 30 . 1 ± 2 . 6 % effi - ciency ) , stiff sRBCs were engulfed with nearly threefold higher efficiency ( 69 . 3 ± 3 . 6 % ) , and this difference was unaffected by inhibition of myosin II with blebbistatin ( Fig . 7e ) . Together , these results show that CR - mediated phagocytosis involves a myosin II - independent mechanosensitive molecular clutch . Discussion This study demonstrates that , contrary to the prevailing view 2 , 14 , 15 , CR - mediated phagocytosis does not proceed by particles sinking into the cell , but is driven by actin - based protrusions that extend along the particle to mediate internalization . Given the rapidity of phagocytosis ( ~ 2 – 5 min ) , protrusion formation could have been missed by electron microscopy , whereas live - cell imaging enables visualization of the entire process . Similar observations were made with mouse and human macrophage cell lines , as well as mouse pri - mary macrophages , suggesting that this mechanism is conserved . We show that CR - mediated phagocytosis and the migration of mesenchymal cells utilize similar mechanisms . In both systems , Arp2 / 3 - mediated polymerization of a dense actin network drives protrusion of the leading edge , while mDia1 follows Arp2 / 3 to promote integrin - dependent coupling to the particle surface . Phagocytic cups contain clusters of α M β 2 integrins and FA pro - teins , suggesting that actin is coupled to integrins by FA machinery . Indeed , we demonstrate that talin , vinculin and tyrosine kinases play critical roles in the transmission of forces generated by the actin cytoskeleton to ligand - engaged α M β 2 integrins , acting as a molecular clutch that drives phagocytosis . We find that macro - phages form phagocytic cups faster on stiffer targets and engulf them more efficiently , indicating that CR - mediated phagocytosis is mechanosensitive . These findings highlight the conserved nature of the molecular clutch to mediate different cell functions in mes - enchymal and immune cells . Despite many commonalities , subtle differences exist that may be critical to the different cellular processes . In migrating cells , most leading edge adhesions disassemble in the lamellum , where formin - dependent polymerization and myosin II - mediated bundling of actin stress fibres drive elongation of remaining adhesions into mature FAs 69 – 72 . In CR - mediated phagocytosis , adhesions formed concomitantly with cup protrusion , but they neither matured , turned over nor formed podosome - like ring structures , suggesting that they are similar to focal complexes 72 . In migrating cells , lamel - lipodial actin polymerization drives retrograde flow , which slows down when engaged to ECM - bound integrins via a talin - mediated molecular clutch 55 , 73 that transmits traction forces to the ECM , and drives leading edge protrusion 20 , 21 . Actin flow slows further in the lamella as the clutch is reinforced by the recruitment of vin - culin , mediated by myosin II activity and paxillin phosphorylation by FAK 29 , 74 , 75 . Variability in the degree of actin – integrin engage - ment in the lamella is thought to regulate the speed of migration 76 . In the phagocytic cup , actin retrograde flow occurred in the lamel - lipodium - like network at the cup edge , but completely ceased in the lamellum - like zone , indicating full engagement of actin to complement - bound integrins , consistent with the observed fast cup protrusion . Recruitment of vinculin was independent of myosin II contractility , and the low traction force and lack of stress fibres support the notion that contractility is low in the cup . Because vin - culin can be recruited to FAs in a myosin - independent manner by interaction with phosphorylated paxillin 29 , or when vinculin con - formation is open 74 , Syk could recruit vinculin to α M β 2 adhesions through phosphorylation of paxillin or vinculin . Thus , comparing the cell migration and phagocytic machinery , the low contractility and tight coupling between actin and integrins induced by Syk - mediated recruitment of vinculin during phagocytosis may shift the balance of actin - driven forces towards less retrograde flow and faster protrusion of the leading edge to promote rapid and efficient target internalization . What might phagocytic preference for stiff targets be good for ? Such mechanosensitivity may influence target discrimination , as cells stiffen during apoptosis , and microbes are much stiffer than mammalian cells 40 – 43 . Such preference could affect antigen uptake and subsequent presentation , thus affecting the ability to mount an adaptive immune response . Mechanosensitivity could also bear on particle - based drug delivery , where phagocytosis reduces particles reaching target tissues 77 . Although FcR - mediated phago - cytosis has also been reported to be mechanosensitive 78 , how these receptors are linked to the cytoskeleton is not known . Elucidating the mechanisms of phagocytic mechanosensitivity could enable engineering of dendritic cells or macrophages with improved anti - tumour response 79 or drug - bearing particles that evade phagocytosis . online content Any methods , additional references , Nature Research reporting summaries , source data , extended data , supplementary informa - tion , acknowledgements , peer review information ; details of author contributions and competing interests ; and statements of data and code availability are available at https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41556 - 019 - 0414 - 2 .

Polystyrene microspheres ( Bangs Laboratories ) were opsonized with purified iC3b ( Complement Technology ) at 100 µ g ml − 1 in PBS , or BSA at 1 mg ml − 1 , overnight at 4 °C . sRBCs ( MP Bio ) were labelled with Alexa Fluor 647 succinimidyl ester ( Invitrogen ) for 1 h at room temperature , then washed in PBS and incubated with an anti - sRBC rabbit IgM ( MyBioSource MBS524107 , 1 : 200 dilution ) for 1 h at room temperature . After washes , RBCs were incubated in 20 % C5 - deficient serum ( Sigma - Aldrich ) at 37 °C for 20 min . Texas Red - labelled zymosan A ( Invitrogen ) was opsonized with 20 % C5 - deficient serum ( Sigma - Aldrich ) at 37 °C for 1 h . Macrophages were plated overnight on # 1 . 5 glass coverslips ( Corning ) , then incubated with 150 ng ml − 1 of PMA in serum - free RPMI 1640 , and the indicated blocking antibodies for CD11b ( BD Pharmingen 553307 ) , CD18 ( BD Pharmingen 553341 ) or rat IgG 2b isotype control ( BD Pharmingen 553985 ) at 10 μ g ml − 1 , 15 min before adding particles . For live - cell microscopy , imaging was started immediately after particle addition . For quantification of phagocytosis , cells were incubated with opsonized particles for 1 h at 37 °C , then rinsed twice and fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde ( Electron Microscopy Science ) in PBS for 20 min . Outside opsonized particles were labelled by immunofluorescence with an anti - iC3b antibody ( GeneTex GTX40522 , 1 : 2 , 000 dilution ) , and nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 ( Thermo Scientific ) . Outside BSA - coated microspheres , unopsonized sRBCs and zymosan A were labelled with anti - BSA ( Abcam ab186531 , 1 : 100 dilution ) , anti - sRBC ( MP Bio 55806 , 1 : 200 dilution ) or anti - 1 , 3 β - glucan antibody ( Abcam ab233743 , 1 : 200 dilution ) , respectively . Image fields of view containing cells were selected randomly and acquired with a × 20 0 . 45 NA objective . At least 1 , 000 cells were quantified per condition for each independent experiment . Binding index ( total cell - associated particles normalized to the number of cell - associated particles in the reference condition , in this case PMA - activated cells ) and phagocytic index ( total internalized particles per cell normalized to internalized particles in the PMA reference condition ) were determined . We included both surface - associated particles and internalized particles when counting ‘binding’ , because it is assumed that a particle had to have bound to the cell in order to be internalized . Phagocytosis efficiency was defined as the percentage of cell - associated particles that were internalized . Silencing of Syk or vinculin expression was verified by western blotting of cell lysates from the same sample of transfected cells , using anti - Syk ( Cell Signaling 13198S , 1 : 1 , 000 dilution ) and anti - vinculin ( Sigma - Aldrich V9131 , 1 : 2 , 000 dilution ) antibodies , respectively . To control for equal loading , the lower parts of the membranes were cut after protein transfer and processed for anti - GAPDH western blotting ( Cell Signaling 5174 , 1 : 5 , 000 dilution ) . Frustrated phagocytosis . Glass coverslips # 1 . 5 were coated with neutravidin ( Thermo Scientific ) at 0 . 5 mg ml − 1 in PBS , at 4 °C for 4 h . After washes , coverslips were incubated with 10 μ g ml − 1 biotin - conjugated M1 / 70 ( BD Pharmingen 553309 ) or rat IgG 2b isotype control ( BD Pharmingen 553987 ) antibodies at 4 °C overnight . Coverslips were then blocked with PLL - PEG ( Susos ) at 0 . 1 mg ml − 1 , at 4 °C for at least 2 h . Macrophages were suspended in ice - cold PBS with 2 mM EDTA by scraping , then washed in serum - free RMPI 1640 , supplemented with 25 mM HEPES pH 7 . 3 and 150 ng ml − 1 PMA 15 min before addition onto the coverslips . Cells were imaged immediately for live - cell microscopy , or fixed with 4 % PFA after 5 min and processed for immunofluorescence . For frustrated phagocytosis on polyacrylamide gels and TFM , 40 - µ m - thick gels with 40 nm TransFluoSpheres ( 633 / 720 ; Thermo scientific ) were prepared on glass coverslips as described before 35 . Neutravidin ( 0 . 5 mg ml − 1 ) was crosslinked to the surface of the gels using sulfo - SANPAH at 1 mg ml − 1 ( Thermo Scientific ) . After washes , gels were incubated with biotin - conjugated M1 / 70 ( BD Pharmingen 553309 ) or rat IgG 2b isotype control ( BD Pharmingen 553987 ) antibodies at 10 μ g ml − 1 , at 4 °C overnight . Microscopy . All live - cell imaging was performed at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 , supplemented with 25 mM HEPES pH 7 . 3 and 150 ng ml − 1 PMA . Microscopy was performed on Nikon Eclipse Ti or Ti2 microscopes equipped with Perfect Focus , a TIRF illuminator , a Yokogawa CSU - X1 or CSU - W1 spinning disk and either a Photometrics Coolsnap Myo or a Hamamatsu Orca - flash 4 . 0 v3 camera . Illumination was provided by fibre - optically ( Oz Optics ) coupled solid - state lasers ( 45 mW , 405 nm ( for photoconversion ) , 100 mW , 488 nm ( for EGFP , EYFP and mEmerald excitation ) , 200 mW , 561 nm ( for mCherry , mEos3 . 2 and Texas Red excitation ) and 100 mW , 655 nm ( for fluorescent beads ) from Spectral Applied Research , and emission was collected via multi - bandpass dichroic and single - bandpass emission filters ( 525 / 50 nm for green , 605 / 52 nm for red ) and a long - pass LP647 nm for far red ( Chroma ) in an electronic filter wheel ( Sutter Instruments ) . Pairs of images in each channel were captured in rapid succession at the noted intervals over time for multi - colour time - lapse imaging . Microscope functions were controlled by Elements ( Nikon ) or Metamorph ( GE ) software . Stage temperature was held constant with an airstream incubator ( Nevtek ) . Phagocytosis of particles was imaged by spinning disk confocal microscopy with a × 100 1 . 49 NA oil objective for 2D imaging , and a × 60 1 . 27 NA water objective for 3D imaging . Frustrated phagocytosis on polyacrylamide gels was imaged by spinning disk confocal microscopy with a × 60 1 . 2 NA water objective . Frustrated phagocytosis on glass coverslips was imaged by TIRF microscopy with a × 60 1 . 49 NA oil objective . TIRF - SIM was performed on a DeltaVision OMX SR microscope , equipped with a × 60 1 . 42 NA oil objective . SIM images were reconstructed using 0 . 02 for the Wiener filter and aligned using softWoRx ( Applied Precision ) . Images were analysed and quantified using ImageJ 1 . 52 ( NIH ) and MetaMorph 7 . 7 ( Meta imaging ) . For 3D imaging , confocal stacks were deconvolved with NIS Elements ( Nikon ) . Quantification of protein recruitment during phagosome formation . For quantification of ArpC2 , mDia1 and F - tractin recruitment to phagosomes , confocal images were acquired every 5 s . Integrated fluorescence intensities were measured in a 6 - µ m - diameter circular ROI , centred on the phagocytosed bead . After background subtraction , measurements were normalized to the maximal intensity and plotted over time relative to the peak of F - tractin recruitment . For each phagosome , recruitment of the fluorescent actin nucleator and fluorescent F - tractin were compared using the cross - correlation function in Matlab . For quantitative measurement of vinculin recruitment to phagosomes , confocal images were acquired every 30 s . Correction for variations in cell thickness within the confocal slice was performed as described previously 68 . Briefly , expression of freely diffusing FusionRed was employed as a volume reference and each cell was treated separately . After background subtraction , each cell was isolated using a mask created with the mEmerald - vinculin channel . Images were normalized by the mean intensity of the entire cytoplasm . Subtraction of the volume ( FusionRed ) image from the mEmerald - vinculin image created an image Re , where the intensity of each pixel represents the amount of protein recruited ( positive values ) or excluded ( negative values ) , relative to the average concentration of protein within the cytoplasm . For each phagosome , vinculin relative recruitment was quantified from the Re image , in a 6 - µ m - diameter circular ROI centred on the phagocytosed bead . Kymograph analysis of actin retrograde flow and cell protrusion . Kymographs for cell protrusion and actin flow measurements were obtained by plotting the fluorescence intensities of the GFP channel along a line perpendicular to the leading edge of the cell ( x axis ) , over the time course of the experiment ( y axis ) , using ImageJ . Slope angles were measured for the initial protrusion of the leading NAtuRe Cell Biology | www . nature . com / naturecellbiology Articles NATurE CEll BIoloGy edge , the actin retrograde flow at the leading edge ( lamellipodium ) and in the lamellum , and converted into velocity . Fluorescent speckle microscopy . RAW macrophages expressing actin - mEos3 . 2 were imaged by spinning disk confocal microscopy . A low level of 405 nm laser light was used for the photoconversion of a small number of mEos3 . 2 - actin molecules from green to red for every time point , and images of red fluorescence were acquired every 3 s . To analyse the flow relative to the particle , image sequences for each phagocytosis event were cropped and realigned in reference to the particle position using ImageJ . Fluorescent speckles were then detected and tracked with the QFSM software from the Danuser lab in Matlab R2016a ( Mathworks ) , as described previously 57 . Immunofluorescence . For immunofluorescence of endogenous adhesion proteins , cells were incubated with opsonized particles , fixed for 10 min at 37 °C , then rinsed twice and fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde ( Electron Microscopy Science ) in cytoskeleton buffer ( 10 mM MES pH 6 . 1 , 138 mM KCl , 3 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM EGTA ) for 20 min . Free aldehydes were quenched 100 mM glycine for 10 min and cells were permeabilized with 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 for 5 min . Endogenous proteins were immuno - labelled using the following antibodies : anti - α - actinin ( Sigma - Aldrich A5044 , 1 : 500 dilution ) , anti - vinculin ( Sigma - Aldrich V9131 , 1 : 500 dilution ) , anti - zyxin ( B71 , 1 : 600 dilution ) , anti - phospho - tyrosine ( EMD Millipore 05 - 321 , 1 : 300 dilution ) , anti - phospho - FAK Y397 ( Invitrogen 44722G , 1 : 100 dilution ) , anti - phospho - paxillin Y31 ( Invitrogen 44720G , 1 : 100 dilution ) , anti - phospho - paxillin Y118 ( Invitrogen 44722G , 1 : 100 dilution ) and anti - Syk Y348 ( BD Pharmingen 558167 , 1 : 200 dilution ) . Cy3 - conjugated secondary antibodies ( Jackson ) and Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin ( Fischer Scientific ) were used at 1 : 400 dilution . Samples were mounted on glass slides with Dako ( Agilent ) . TFM . Polyacrylamide gels ( 4 . 07 kPa shear modulus , 40 μ m thickness ) were prepared on glass coverslips with embedded 40 nm fluorescent beads ( TransFluoSpheres ( 633 / 720 ) , Thermo Scientific ) , as described previously 35 . An average of 10 images of the beads in the gels were acquired before addition of macrophages as a no - stress reference . Macrophages were added and beads ( as markers of gel deformation deformation ) and expressed fluorescent proteins were imaged every 10 s during frustrated phagocytosis . Bead displacements relative to the reference position were determined using particle image velocimetry , and the corresponding contractile energy was estimated with Fourier transform traction cytometry , using the ImageJ plugins previously described 61 . The phagocytic cup area was determined by manually drawing an ROI following the leading edge of the cup in the fluorescent protein channel . Maximal and mean stress within the phagocytic cup were measured at the time point when the cup reached its maximal surface area . For measurement of traction force over time , the mean magnitude of traction stress within the cup was measured and reported relative to the surface area of the cup . AFM . sRBCs were plated on a glass - bottomed dish ( Willco Wells ) pre - coated with 0 . 01 % poly - l - lysine ( Life Technologies ) and immersed in PBS solution ( Life Technologies ) . Force - mapping AFM experiments were performed using a Bruker Bioscope Catalyst AFM system ( Bruker ) mounted on an inverted Axiovert 200M microscope ( Zeiss ) equipped with a confocal laser scanning microscope 510 Meta ( Zeiss ) and a × 40 objective lens ( 0 . 95 NA , Plan - Apochromat , Zeiss ) with the temperature kept at 37 °C using a heated stage ( Bruker ) . A soft silicon nitride AFM probe ( MLCT , Bruker ) was used with the following tip dimensions : height of 2 . 5 – 8 µ m , nominal radius of 20 nm and nominal half - opening angle of 18° . The AFM microcantilevers were pre - calibrated using the standard thermal noise fluctuation method . The estimated spring constants for the microcantilevers used were 0 . 02 – 0 . 06 N m − 1 . After calibration , the AFM probe was moved on top of a cell . Five successive curves were performed for each cell . The deflection setpoint was set to 20 nm , yielding applied forces between 400 pN and 1 nN . The force - mapping scan speed was 0 . 5 Hz . Young’s modulus was determined from the force – distance curves using NanoScope Analysis software ( Bruker ) . For fitting , indentation depths between 0 and 100 nm were consistent in yielding good fits ( R 2 > 0 . 9 ) . Curves with poor fits ( R 2 < 0 . 9 ) were discarded from the analysis . The cellular elastic Young’s modulus ( E , in Pa ) was computed by fitting each recorded force – distance curve with Sneddon’s contact mechanics model for indenting an infinite isotropic elastic half - space with a conical indenter 80 : F Sneddon ¼ 8 E tan α 3 π δ 2 where F is the applied force , α is the tip half - opening angle and δ is the sample mean indentation . Statistics and reproducibility . Statistical analysis was performed using Prism 7 ( GraphPad ) .
