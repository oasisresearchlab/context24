In large outbreaks , this can stretch resources and workforce due to quar - antine of uninfected staff . We analysed the performance of a manual contact tracing system for healthcare workers ( HCW ) at a multi - site healthcare facility in Melbourne , Australia , from June e September 2020 , during an epidemic of COVID - 19 . Methods : All HCW close contacts were quarantined for 14 days , and tested around day 11 , if not already diagnosed with COVID - 19 . We examined the prevalence and timing of symptoms in cases detected during quarantine , described this group as proportions of all close contacts and of all cases , and used logistic regression to assess factors associated with infection . Results : COVID - 19 was diagnosed during quarantine in 52 furloughed HCWs , from 483 quaran - tine episodes ( 11 % ) , accounting for 19 % ( 52 / 270 ) of total HCW cases . In 361 exposures to a clear index case , odds of infection were higher after contact with an infectious patient compared to an infectious HCW ( aOR : 4 . 69 , 95 % CI : 1 . 98 e 12 . 14 ) . Contact with cases outside the workplace increased odds of infection compared to workplace contact only ( aOR : 7 . 70 , * Corresponding author .

(cid:1) 11 % developed COVID - 19 in quarantine , accounting for 19 % of all healthcare worker cases . (cid:1) Odds of COVID - 19 were higher after contact with infectious patients compared to infectious healthcare workers . (cid:1) Odds of COVID - 19 were higher if close contact occurred outside of work . Introduction Contact tracing is a key part of the public health response to novel coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) [ 1 ] . Modelling suggests that effective case isolation , contact tracing and quarantine can effectively control outbreaks , and that these strategies provide additional beneﬁt when combined with population wide non - pharmaceutical interventions ( NPIs ) to limit physical contact [ 2 ] . In Australia , imple - mentation of coordinated contact tracing , together with strict border measures , has allowed easing of NPIs without sustained community transmission [ 3 ] . Health care workers ( HCWs ) are at signiﬁcantly elevated risk of COVID - 19 [ 4 , 5 ] , so implementation of effective contact tracing in health care settings should be prioritised . However contact tracing is resource intensive [ 6 ] , and in the context of large outbreaks quarantining large numbers of HCW can heavily impact health systems [ 7 ] . Various frameworks have been suggested to guide contact tracing in health care settings [ 6 , 8 ] . However , there is a need to determine the most effective , and least restrictive , strategies for isolation , testing , and return to work [ 9 ] . We conducted a retrospective analysis of contact tracing data during an outbreak to examine the rate and timing of COVID - 19 onset among HCW close contacts identiﬁed through hospital - based contact tracing , and to identify factors associated with increased risk of infection in this group . Methods Setting We sourced data from a large public tertiary hospital in Melbourne , Victoria . The facility includes a 550 bed tertiary campus , a 150 bed aged care and sub - acute campus , a large mental health service and four residential aged care facil - ities . Around 10 , 000 staff were employed across 32 sites , although about 70 % worked at the two main metropolitan campuses . Victoria experienced a second epidemic of COVID - 19 between June and October 2020 , driven largely by local transmission within Melbourne . Stage 3 restrictions ( including the closure of bars , entertainment venues , and places of worship , limiting restaurants to take - away only , and prohibiting public gatherings of more than two people ) were implemented in 10 postcodes from 2 July , and expanded to all of metropolitan Melbourne from 8 July . From 2 August , Stage 4 restrictions were introduced ( including an overnight curfew , limits on movement to within a 5 km radius of one’s residence except for essential activities , and a 1 h limit on outdoor exercise ) . The epidemic included around 18 , 650 cases and peaked on 4 August with 687 new diagnoses [ 10 ] . The temporal distri - bution of new diagnoses of COVID - 19 in HCWs across the facility over this period resembled the shape of the epidemic curve for Victoria as a whole [ 10 , 11 ] . Use of NPIs to reduce transmission risk to HCWs at the facility changed signiﬁcantly over the same period . In particular , mandatory universal mask wearing , even in non - clinical settings , was introduced and expanded from early July ( Supplementary table 1 ) . From mid - July , staff were required to wear N95 masks at all times in high - risk areas such as wards dedicated to the care of COVID - 19 patients . Contact tracing For the purposes of this report , we deﬁne isolation as separation of suspected or conﬁrmed cases from the gen - eral population , and quarantine as separation of non - cases deemed to be at elevated risk of infection based on expo - sure history . Furlough refers to the temporary removal of HCW from the workforce , while in isolation or quarantine . Hospital - based contact tracing was undertaken by the Infection Prevention and Surveillance Service ( IPSS ) in accordance with guidelines provided by the Victorian Department of Health and Human Services ( DHHS ) [ 12 ] . Cases were notiﬁed to IPSS by the hospital laboratory , if tested at the facility . If tested elsewhere , cases were C . R . Bailie , V . K . Leung , E . Orr et al . + MODEL 2 notiﬁed by DHHS , the positive staff member themselves , or their manager . An IPSS staff member interviewed each HCW case via phone as soon as practical after they were notiﬁed . Contact tracing was performed for the infectious period from 48 h prior to symptom onset , or ﬁrst positive test if asymptom - atic at notiﬁcation , until the case was isolated . Close contacts were deﬁned by DHHS as people who had either : a ) (cid:3) 15 min cumulative face - to - face contact during the prior week , b ) (cid:3) 2 h in a conﬁned space shared with a conﬁrmed or probable case during the prior week , or c ) been exposed to a particular setting judged by IPSS to be associated with a high risk of infection ( such as a ward experiencing a widespread outbreak ) [ 12 ] . HCWs wearing appropriate personal protective equip - ment ( PPE ) during care of suspected , probable or conﬁrmed patient cases were not considered close contacts unless a breach in PPE was identiﬁed [ 12 ] . From 11 July , following advice from DHHS , mask use was considered when risk assessing contact between HCWs . In instances where both case and contact were HCWs , and both were masked , the above close contact deﬁnition was no longer applied . Instead , designation as a close contact was subject to in - dividual risk assessment by IPSS , considering nature and duration of contact , as well as whether the case was symptomatic . Data were collected on all close contacts within the facility , and any close contact with other staff that occurred external to the facility . Data were entered into a REDCap database at the time of contact tracing . HCW close contacts were contacted via phone and furloughed for 14 days from the last date of close contact . IPSS staff or a wellbeing team staff member provided regular follow up over the quarantine period and assisted contacts to seek testing if they developed symptoms . Re - turn to work was contingent on a negative test result on or after day 11 and completion of quarantine , regardless of test results , although some staff also underwent asymp - tomatic testing earlier in the quarantine period . Testing was performed using polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) on upper respiratory tract samples ( nose and throat swab ) . Testing for respiratory viruses other than severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) was not routinely performed . Data source and study population We extracted data from the REDCap database used by IPSS for case and contact management . We deﬁned HCWs as anyone working or undertaking study in the facility and who could be exposed either directly or indirectly to SARS - CoV - 2 in that setting . We included data from June e September 2020 for all cases of COVID - 19 diagnosed in HCWs who attended the facility , and all HCW close contacts of another HCW , patient , or visitor case . We excluded records for HCW close contacts of a case in the community who was not also a HCW , because these contacts were not identiﬁed through hospital - based contact tracing . We also excluded records where there were insufﬁcient data to determine why the HCW had been designated a close contact . Individual HCWs could have multiple instances in the database if they were furloughed on multiple occasions . Data analysis Data analysis was performed in R version 6 . 3 . 1 [ 13 ] . We calculated the overall proportion of HCW close contact in - stances resulting in diagnosis of COVID - 19 during quaran - tine . We excluded from further analysis instances where HCW were furloughed without a clear index case , i . e . they were deﬁned as a close contact according to deﬁnition c ) above , but there were insufﬁcient data to identify details and timing of speciﬁc cases they were exposed to . For each HCW close contact instance , we extracted data on age , sex , role , symptom onset , test dates and results , number of linked potential source cases , whether the linked case ﬁrst resulting in the HCW being quarantined ( index case ) was another HCW , a patient , or a visitor , place of contact with the index case , and date of last close contact . We classiﬁed role as “clinical” for HCWs involved directly with patient care , for example nurses , doctors , and allied health staff . Other staff , for example cleaning , administrative , security , or food handling staff we classiﬁed as “non - clinical” . We classiﬁed place of close contact into either “workplace only” , or “external (cid:4) workplace” where there had been close contact external to the facility , for example in a household or social setting , regardless of whether there was also contact within the facility . We used univariate and multivariate logistic regression models to assess potential factors associated with increased odds of testing positive during quarantine , based on data available from the contact tracing database . We included HCW role , number of linked cases , place of con - tact with the index case , and type of index case as cate - gorical predictors in both univariate and multivariate models , based on a priori assumptions of possible inde - pendent causal effects . We tested interactions between these variables , but none were statistically signiﬁcant , and we did not include them in the multivariate model ( data not shown ) . We included sex and age group in the multivariate model in an attempt to reduce confounding due to un - measured behavioural factors . For HCW close contacts who tested positive during quarantine and developed symptoms , we plotted a histo - gram of symptom onset by days since last close contact . We ﬁtted gamma , Weibull and lognormal distributions using the R package “ﬁtdistrplus” [ 14 ] . We chose the best ﬁtting model based on the Akaike information criterion ( AIC ) , calculated 95 % conﬁdence intervals by bootstrapping with 1000 iterations , and calculated 95 % prediction intervals for developing symptoms by days 3 , 7 , and 11 post last close contact . Results We screened 506 HCW close contact records , excluded 13 due to missing data , and a further 10 identiﬁed through community rather than hospital - based contact tracing ( Fig . 1 ) . In the remaining 483 instances , HCWs were desig - nated as close contacts and furloughed through hospital - Infection , Disease & Health xxx ( xxxx ) xxx + MODEL 3 based contact tracing . Of these , 11 % ( 52 / 483 ) resulted in diagnosis of COVID - 19 during quarantine , which repre - sented 19 % ( 52 / 270 ) of HCW cases identiﬁed in the facility . In 25 % ( 122 / 483 ) of instances , HCWs were furloughed without recorded contact with an index case , while in 75 % ( 361 / 483 ) of instances , HCWs were furloughed following close contact with an index case . Twelve of 122 instances ( 10 % ) where there was no known contact with an index case resulted in a diagnosis of COVID - 19 . These instances were not analysed as speciﬁc index case data were not available . Forty of the remaining 361 instances ( 11 % ) where there was known contact with an index case resulted in a diagnosis of COVID - 19 . These 361 instances represent data from 357 unique HCWs , as 4 were quarantined more than once . The median age of these 357 furloughed HCWs was 32 years ( range 21 e 70 ) , 283 ( 79 % ) were female , and 314 ( 88 % ) worked in clinical roles ( 218 nurses , 58 doctors , 26 allied health staff , and 12 students ) . These HCWs were fur - loughed due to close contact with at least one of 97 source cases , including 71 HCW cases , 24 patient cases where contact occurred without appropriate PPE , and two visitor cases . In 28 instances HCWs were identiﬁed as close con - tacts of more than one case and in 333 as close contacts of one case only ( Table 1 ) . In the multivariate model , odds of infection were higher for close contact with a patient versus a HCW index case ( aOR : 4 . 69 , 95 % CI : 1 . 98 e 12 . 14 ) , and for close contacts with any close contact occurring external to the workplace ( aOR : 7 . 70 , 95 % CI : 2 . 63 e 23 . 05 , Table 1 ) . For sex , age group , role of the HCW contact , and the number of linked cases , estimated effect sizes were small , and conﬁdence intervals included an odds ratio of 1 . The timing of testing and symptom onset was analysed in 39 of 40 HCW cases diagnosed in quarantine ( Fig . 2 , test dates were missing for one HCW ) . Seventeen cases were initially tested within 3 days of furlough either because of symptoms ( 8 / 17 ) or as part of asymptomatic screening ( 9 / 17 ) , among whom 65 % ( 11 / 17 ) were positive ( Fig . 2 ) . Symptoms developed in 63 % ( 25 / 40 ) of cases during the quarantine period . For these cases , the distribution of days from last contact to symptom onset was best approximated by a gamma distribution , with marginally lower AIC than the lognormal distribution ( Supplementary ﬁgure 1 ) . Based on the ﬁtted model parameters we estimated 30 % ( 95 % CI : 16 e 46 % ) of symptomatic infected HCWs would develop symptoms by 3 days since last close contact , 78 % ( 95 % CI : 65 e 92 % ) by 7 days and 95 % ( 95 % CI : 88 e 100 % ) by 11 days ( Supplementary table 2 ) . In 9 % ( 31 / 361 ) of instances , HCWs reported COVID - 19 compatible symptoms in quarantine but were not identiﬁed as cases . However , all reported onset prior to 11 days since last close contact and tested negative around day 11 . Of these 31 HCWs , 27 had also earlier tested negative at onset of symptoms . Discussion In our study , approximately one in ten close contact HCWs tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 during quarantine , repre - senting 19 % of all HCW infections . We identiﬁed close contact with infected patients compared with infected HCWs , or close contact outside the health - care facility as possible risk factors for infection in quarantined HCWs . More than a third of cases diagnosed in quarantine did not develop symptoms . We estimated that almost all symp - tomatic infected HCWs developed symptoms by 11 days after their most recent close contact with an infectious case . Strategies for contact tracing and quarantine should consider both individual and workforce impacts of fur - loughing staff , as well as the beneﬁts associated with pre - venting transmission . In our setting , approximately 9 non - infected close contacts were furloughed for every case contained in quarantine . Given the substantial proportion Figure 1 Selection of health care worker ( HCW ) database records for inclusion . C . R . Bailie , V . K . Leung , E . Orr et al . + MODEL 4 of overall SARS - CoV - 2 transmission from asymptomatic and presymptomatic cases to ( estimated to be between 20 % and 70 % ) [ 15 ] , we believe this represents a favourable trade - off . The consequences of transmission in a high - risk setting are serious , although these have to be balanced with the risks of furloughing a signiﬁcant proportion of a critical workforce . This study was conducted in the setting of widespread community transmission , with increasing HCW infections mirroring an increase in cases in the community . Our ﬁnding that risk of infection was increased with contact outside the healthcare setting is in keeping with previous in - vestigations of infected HCWs [ 16 ] , and the known pro - pensity of SARS - CoV - 2 to spread within households [ 17 ] . Our investigation highlights that hospital infection control and prevention teams need to effectively cooperate with and conduct joint risk assessments with public health author - ities conducting community contact tracing . During the COVID - 19 epidemic in Victoria , about 70 % of HCW or aged - care worker infections were thought to be acquired at work [ 18 ] . However , the minority of cases in our facility were detected through workplace contact tracing , with the majority detected either through symptomatic testing or wider asymptomatic screening [ 11 ] . Clearly , effective contact tracing should be accompanied by other strategies to reduce workplace transmission . Such strate - gies include targeted asymptomatic testing , screening everyone entering the workplace for symptoms of COVID - 19 , as well as optimising air ﬂow and use of PPE [ 19 ] . Our ﬁndings suggest that among those quarantined , contact with known infected patients presented higher risk of infection than contact with known infected HCWs . This might reﬂect generally higher viral loads among admitted patients , associated with more severe disease [ 20 ] , and differences in nature and extent of HCW - HCW and HCW - patient close contact . Several studies have attempted to follow - up HCWs exposed to COVID - 19 patients , and have generally found low rates of infection [ 21 e 24 ] . However these typically involve a small number of selected patients [ 21 e 24 ] , and hospital seroprevalence studies suggest many HCW cases go undiagnosed [ 25 , 26 ] . Thus , there is a need for systematic prospective research involving follow - up and testing of casual contacts of hospitalised COVID - 19 patients to better deﬁne risk of infection and to reﬁne quarantine requirements . We estimated that 88 e 100 % of HCWs who develop symptoms after being quarantined will do so within 11 days of last close contact . This is consistent with data on the incubation period of SARS - CoV - 2 [ 27 ] , accounting for some HCWs being infected prior to the most recent exposure . Given SARS - CoV - 2 viral load in upper respiratory tract samples peaks around symptom onset [ 20 , 28 ] , and that viral load appears to be similar in asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic cases [ 29 e 31 ] , testing on day 11 could be expected to detect the vast majority of HCW cases who would otherwise pose a risk of onwards transmission . Our ﬁndings suggest that a strategy involving testing on days 3 or 7 might fail to detect a substantial proportion of Table 1 Characteristics of health care workers ( HCWs ) furloughed due to close contact on 361 occasions , results of univariate and multivariate logistic regression predicting diagnosis of COVID - 19 by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) during 14 day quarantine .

Infection , Disease & Health xxx ( xxxx ) xxx + MODEL 5 asymptomatic or pre - symptomatic cases . Indeed , a number of HCW cases in our study were PCR - negative when tested early in the quarantine period . However , earlier identiﬁ - cation of infected HCWs in quarantine would have facili - tated earlier identiﬁcation of their contacts , providing opportunities to prevent further transmission . Our study has several limitations . First , due to the sub - stantial workload on contact tracing staff , data sometimes contained limited information on nature of contact or possible exposures outside of the workplace , preventing more detailed analysis . Further , during the peak of the second epidemic , delays of up to several days in both turn - around time of results from some external pathology ser - vices , and in case follow - up and reporting by the DHHS , in turn led to unavoidable delays in initiating contact tracing , which may have affected the ability of cases to provide an accurate history of contact at the time of interview . Second , when investigating factors associated with risk of infection in close contacts , we considered information about the index case , but not other cases the HCW was subse - quently identiﬁed as having been exposed to . While this approach may be helpful in informing risk assessment in real - time , it does not account for possible sources of infection other than the index case . While exposure misclassiﬁcation due to undocumented contact is likely to have occurred , we did not set out to make inferences based on a complete picture of each individual’s exposures , but to determine how contact tracing data could be used to better deﬁne risk . Third , it is possible some asymptomatic cases with long incubation periods may have gone undetected on day 11 testing , biasing estimates around symptom onset towards earlier in the quarantine period . However , this seems un - likely based on current incubation period data [ 27 ] , and we are not aware of any study HCWs being diagnosed in the immediate period following quarantine . Fourth , caution should be used in attempting to apply our ﬁndings to other settings , as a range of dynamic and difﬁcult to measure factors affect generalisability . These include HCW factors , such as the proportion of staff vaccinated or previously infected , facility factors including close contact deﬁnitions and workplace practices , and pathogen factors including the presence of more infectious variants . The COVID - 19 pandemic has demonstrated the critical importance of systems for hospital contact tracing , but has also put them under unprecedented strain . In our setting , contact tracing detected and contained a substantial pro - portion of HCW cases , without requiring furlough of an excessive number of non - infected staff . These data demonstrate that our contact tracing and furlough pro - cedures likely prevented many more cases in HCWs , although there were signiﬁcant impacts on the workforce . Collection of large amounts of data for contact tracing purposes poses logistical challenges , but it also provides opportunities to gain insight into how systems are per - forming and may be improved . This requires hospitals to implement robust processes for data collection and stor - age , facilitating near to real - time analysis . This may be aided by better integrating systems for contact tracing run by hospitals and other public health agencies , and by exploring novel methods for automated contact tracing [ 32 ] . Planning for hospital - based contact tracing should be accompanied by workforce planning that can accommodate furlough of large numbers of staff .
