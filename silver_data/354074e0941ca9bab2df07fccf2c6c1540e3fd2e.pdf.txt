Yet it has remained mysterious because of the experimental hurdles that beset the study of this developmental phase . Here , we establish an in vitro system to culture human embryos through implantation stages in the absence of maternal tissues and reveal the key events of early human morphogenesis . These include segregation of the pluripotent embryonic and extra - embryonic lineages , and morphogenetic rearrangements leading to generation of a bilaminar disc , formation of a pro - amniotic cavity within the embryonic lineage , appearance of the prospective yolk sac , and trophoblast differentiation . Using human embryos and human pluripotent stem cells , we show that the reorganization of the embryonic lineage is mediated by cellular polarization leading to cavity formation . Together , our results indicate that the critical remodelling events at this stage of human development are embryo - autonomous , highlighting the remarkable and unanticipated self - organizing properties of human embryos . The development of a human embryo from a fertilized egg begins with a series of cleavage divisions and morphogenetic rearrangements that lead to the formation of a free - floating blastocyst . This blastocyst comprises three distinct cell lineages : embryonic tissue ( epiblast ) and twoextra - embryonictissues ( hypoblastandtrophectoderm ) that , after implantation into the uterus , will give rise to the yolk sac and pla - centa respectively . This pre - implantation period has been extensively studied using methods that pioneered in vitro fertilization 1 , 2 ( IVF ) . However , on the seventh day of development , the human embryo must implant into the uterus of the mother to survive , to establish the body plan and to generate the germ layers . The failure of an embryo to implant is a major cause of early pregnancy loss 3 and yet the cellular and molecular changes that take place in the human embryo at this stageremainunknown . Thisisbecauseexperiments invivo arenotfea - sible and there has been no system to culture human embryos ex vivo . Monkey embryos have been used as a model for human embryo development 4 , 5 and the co - culture of human blastocysts and endometrial cells 6 has provided an experimental system to model post - implantation morphogenesis . However , the extent to which these systems recapitulate post - implantation development of the human embryo remains an open question . Moreover , the potential of human blastocysts for self - organization has never been explored . Here , to shed light on the early post - implantation phases of human development , we have adapted our recently established protocol for mouse embryos 7 , 8 . The culture system we have established allows human embryos to undergo the pre - to post - implantation transition in vitro , in the absence of any maternal tissues . By comparing human embryos developing in vitro and the Carnegie series of in vivo developinghumanembryos 9 , wehaveidentifiedthatthekeyhallmarks of human embryogenesis take place in the absence of any maternal tissues , uncovering the self - organizing properties of human embryos at this stage . RESULTS Establishment of a method to culture human embryos through implantation stages in vitro To gain understanding of the developmental events undertaken by the implanting human embryo , we reasoned that we needed an in vitro culture system that would recapitulate these processes . To this end , we adapted the culture conditions we had previously es - tablished for mouse embryos at comparable stages 7 .

( a ) Human embryos were thawed and cultured until the blastocyst stage ( day 5 – 6 of development ) . The zona pellucida was removed and embryos were transferred to plates in IVC1 medium for imaging .

Embryos were scored by morphological criteria and those showing abnormalities ( fragmented blastomeres or developmentally arrested ) were discarded . We first plated human blastocysts on optical - grade dishes in 21 % O 2 and in in vitro culture medium 1 ( IVC1 ) , which was replaced by in vitro culture medium 2 ( IVC2 ) after 48h ( Fig . 1a , b ) 7 . Time - lapse microscopy revealed that human blastocysts cultured in IVC1 underwent a series of contractions and expansions reflecting collapse and subsequent enlargement of the blastocyst cavity ( Supple - mentary Video 1 ) , as observed in IVF clinics 10 . However , by the end of day 7 , the blastocyst cavity completely collapsed and embryos attached to the dish ( Fig . 1b – d ) . At this time the attached embryos started to grow and this growth continued until day 12 – 13 ( Fig . 1c , d and Supplementary Video 2 ) . We previously found that either human cord serum or KnockOut Serum Replacement ( KSR ) in IVC2 permits peri - implantation mouse development 11 . Here we show human embryos develop in medium supplemented with KSR up to day 13 ( Fig . 1b – d ) . The experiment was stopped at this point because the internationally recognized ethical limit for human embryo culture is up to day 14 or to the first signs of development of the primitive streak 12 . The trend in IVF clinics over recent years has been to culture pre - implantation human embryos in hypoxic conditions ( 5 % O 2 ) , as this favours embryo survival 13 and inhibits diﬀerentiation in embryonic NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 18 | NUMBER 6 | JUNE 2016 © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

However , after 4 days in culture , whereas 49 % of embryos ( N = 59 ) cultured in 21 % O 2 maintained a cluster of epiblast cells showing expression of the pluripotency factor OCT4 , none of the embryos cultured in hypoxic conditions ( N = 20 ) had OCT4 - expressing cells ( Supplementary Table 1 ) .

These data involved the assessment of a total of 59 embryos collected across 6 experiments , out of which 29 showed preservation of the embryonic lineage . This suggests that preservation of the epiblast in vitro beyond day 7 might benefit from higher O 2 concentrations possibly because of the increase in embryo size , which may decrease the O 2 pressure in the core of the embryo . Hypoxia clearly has a complex influence on embryonic development and its eﬀects need to be better understood in the intrauterine milieu to determine exactly how it aﬀects both mouse and human embryogenesis 16 . As a result of these findings , here we cultured human embryos beyond day 7 in 21 % O 2 , which we show permits further development of the pluripotent lineage in vitro . Development of the embryonic and extra - embryonic lineages during human post - implantation morphogenesis in vitro To gain temporal understanding of the cellular and developmental events through early post - implantation development , we fixed and immunostained human embryos at diﬀerent time points of culture . We used KnockOut Serum Replacement to supplement the medium as it permits a more reproducible time course of development than human cord serum 7 . We have focused on development between days 7 and 11 , because during these 5 days the embryo undergoes a major reorganization that is necessary for subsequent gastrulation 9 . Shortly after attachment ( day 7 – 8 of development ) , we observed a clear separation between embryonic ( OCT4 - expressing , epiblast ) and extra - embryonic ( GATA6 - expressing , hypoblast ) cells , the respective progenitors for the fetus and yolk sac ( Fig . 3a ) , whereas in the unattached blastocysts , this segregation of epiblast and hypoblast progenitors had not yet taken place ( Fig . 2b ) . This contrasts with mouse embryos , where the epiblast and the hypoblast - equivalent ( the primitive endoderm ) segregate already before implantation 17 ; but agrees with observations in human embryos 18 – 22 . We found that at day 7 – 8 , the epiblast was formed by a cluster of about 20 OCT4 - expressing NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 18 | NUMBER 6 | JUNE 2016 © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved 703 T E C H N I C A L R E P O RT cells surrounded by approximately 50 GATA6 - expressing hypoblast cells ( Fig . 3a and Supplementary Table 2 ) . By day 8 – 9 , GATA6 - expressing hypoblast cells preferentially localized to one side of the epiblast , as occurs in human embryos developing in vivo 9 . This spatial organization was maintained throughout subsequent developmental stages ( from day 9 to day 11 ; Fig . 3a and Supplementary Fig . 1a and Supplementary Videos 3 and 4 ) . By day 11 , the number of OCT4 - expressing epiblast cells had significantly increased to an average of 328 cells , whereas the number of GATA6 - expressing hypoblast cells increased up to 79 ( Supplementary Table 2 ) . To analyse development of trophectoderm , the progenitors of the placenta , we followed cytokeratin 7 ( CK7 ) , which is highly expressed in trophoblast derivatives 23 . We found that the trophectoderm cells surrounding the epiblast and hypoblast ( Fig . 3b ) presented a polarized epithelial phenotype , evident from the localization of the apical determinant PAR6 ( Fig . 3c ) . From day 8 onwards , we noted the presence of CK7 - expressing multinucleated cells in the outermost region of the embryo ( Fig . 3d ) . To determine their exact position with respect to the epiblast – hypoblast cluster , we performed a three - dimensional ( 3D ) reconstruction of cellular shapes , based on the computational segmentation of membranes and nuclei ( Fig . 3e ) . This revealed two trophectoderm subpopulations : cells in proximity to the epiblast – hypoblast bilayer had a single nucleus , whereas those in the periphery of the embryo were multinucleated and exhibited characteristic lacunae ( Fig . 3e and Supplementary Video 5 ) . On the basis of the expression of CK7 , their position and their cellular and nuclear shape , these two cell populations are likely to correspond to the cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast respectively , indicating that the development of post - implantation trophoblast derivatives can be recapitulated in the absence of any maternal tissue . Together these results demonstrate that the development of all three lineages progresses as human embryos develop in vitro . Human epiblast polarization and pro - amniotic cavity formation Next , we focused on the development of the epiblast because it undergoes its first major reorganization at implantation . One of the hallmarks of epiblast transformation is the acquisition of a polarized phenotypeandtheformationofalumen , theprospectivepro - amniotic cavity 9 , 24 , essential for the subsequent development of the body plan . However , the cellular mechanisms underlying lumen formation in humans remain unknown . Whereas some reports in higher primates pointtowardscelldeathwithintheepiblastasthemaindriveroflumen formation 25 , alternative reports suggest folding of the epiblast 26 , or a change of polarity in epiblast cells 4 . Importantly , these hypotheses are based on the observations of rhesus monkey embryos by electron microscopy as , so far , it has not been possible to definitively identify cell types and their features in human embryos at implantation . We found that at day 7 – 8 of development , the epiblast was a cluster of cells showing no signs of polarization ( Fig . 4a and Supplementary Figs 1b and2 ) . However , byday8 – 9 , agroupofOCT4 - expressingepiblastcells became radially organized around a small central lumen . These cells were apico - basally polarized in 31 % of the embryos ( Supplementary Table 1 ) , as determined by the polarized apical localization of actin and aPKC ( the principal kinase of the apical Par polarity complex ; Fig . 4a and Supplementary Fig . 1b ) . The formation of a small lumen at the exact site of incipient apical polarization indicates the onset of pro - amniotic cavity formation within the epiblast . Importantly , we did notobserveanyapoptoticcell , cellulardebrisoranyotherindicationof cell death in the incipient pro - amniotic cavity ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . These results indicate that the epiblast becomes polarized by day 9 of in vitro development and suggest that apoptosis is not the mechanism driving lumenogenesis in human embryos . Human bilaminar disc formation The next expected remodelling event is the formation of the amniotic epithelium and the epiblast disc . In contrast to the mouse , in which the amnion is formed at gastrulation , the amnion is expected to form in humans shortly after implantation with those epiblast cells adjacent to the hypoblast acquiring a columnar shape , and those in contact with cytotrophoblast diﬀerentiating into squamous and flat amniotic epithelium . At this stage , both tissues line the pro - amniotic cavity 24 . We observed that as development of embryos progressed in vitro , the epiblast and the pro - amniotic cavity expanded in size ( Fig . 4a , b and Supplementary Fig . 4 and Supplementary Table 2 and SupplementaryVideo6 ) , indicativeofembryogrowth . Atday10 – 11of development , we could detect two morphologically distinct groups of OCT4 - expressing cells . 3D reconstructions of cellular shapes revealed that OCT4 - expressing cells located near the hypoblast had a columnar morphology whereas opposite - facing OCT4 - expressing cells had a distinct squamous and flat shape ( Fig . 4c and Supplementary Video 7 ) . Moreover , these flat OCT4 - expressing cells were in close proximity to cells with a higher nuclear volume ( on average 2 . 5 times bigger than epiblast cells ) , a feature characteristic of trophoblast cells . These observations suggest that the two types of OCT4 - expressing cells may represent the epiblast disc and the prospective amniotic epithelium . Human prospective yolk sac formation The next expected event of human embryo development is the reorganization of hypoblast cells to give rise to a second cavity , the primary yolk sac 9 , 27 , which will provide the blood supply to the developing fetus . Remarkably , we found that human embryos developing in vitro established a second cavity at day 11 of development ( Supplementary Video 8 ) . This cavity was localized below the epiblast and was surrounded by GATA6 - expressing cells , highlighting its hypoblast origin ( Fig . 4d , e and Supplementary Video 9 ) . Thus , both expression of characteristic lineage markers as well as morphological features suggest that formation of the prospective yolk sac can be also recapitulated in human embryos developing in vitro ( Fig . 4f ) . Human pluripotent stem cells ( hPSCs ) recapitulate the events of polarization and lumenogenesis As the above results revealed that epiblast polarization and lumen formation are the first features of epiblast morphogenesis after implantation , we next investigated the molecular pathways that could be responsible for this critical remodelling . Given the ethical restrictions and the limited number of human embryos available for functional studies , we turned to human embryonic stem cells ( hESCs ) and human induced pluripotent stem cells ( hiPSCs ) as alternative models . First , to determine whether the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) participatesininducingepiblastpolarizationandlumenformation , we cultured individual hESCs in 3D Matrigel .

The main remodelling events that take place during this transition are : segregation of epiblast and hypoblast progenitors ( day 7 ) ; polarization and pro - amniotic cavity formation in the epiblast ( day 8 – 10 ) ; differentiation of the trophectoderm ( TE ) into cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast cells ( day 8 – 10 ) ; formation of the prospective amniotic epithelium , the prospective yolk sac and the bilaminar disc ( day 10 – 11 ) .

As the hESCs continued to divide , they self - organized around a central lumen . These hESC cysts were apico - basally polarized , as demonstrated by the polarized localization of aPKC ( Fig . 5a ) , PAR6 ( Fig . 5b ) , centrosomes ( Fig . 5c ) and the Golgi ( Fig . 5d ) . They retained expression of pluripotency markers such as OCT4 ( Fig . 5a ) , mimicking the preservation of OCT4 in the epiblast of in vitro - cultured human embryos ( Fig . 3 ) . To confirm these results , we next plated hiPSCs into 3D Matrigel as we did with hESCs . We found that hiPSCs also polarized and began to form NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 18 | NUMBER 6 | JUNE 2016 © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

Lumens formed on the apical side of polarized cells that exhibited apical microvilli and a polarized distribution of aPKC , PAR6 and the Golgi ( Fig . 6a – c ) . This polarized organization was preserved in the presence of the ROCK inhibitor Y - 27632 ( Fig . 6d ) , commonly used to avoid cell death at the time of plating of hPSCs . We could also detect lumen - directed secretion of the anti - adhesive protein podocalyxin ( PODXL ) , implicatedinlumenformationthroughcharge repulsion 29 , 30 ( Fig . 6e , f ) . The observation that hPSC cysts develop lumens between two cells as they become polarized suggests that lumen formation is not a consequence of cell death . To test this possibility directly , we treated hiPSCs with a caspase 3 inhibitor to prevent cell death 8 and found that polarization and lumen formation were not aﬀected ( Fig . 6g , h ) . Taken together , our results indicate that lumen formation is a consequence of cellular polarization and not cell deathandleadustosuggestthatsimilarmolecularpathwaysmaydrive lumenogenesis in human embryos soon after implantation . DISCUSSION Implantation is a milestone in human development , as this is the time when the embryo undergoes major remodelling , which is absolutely required for correct gastrulation and therefore successful body formation and pregnancy outcome . However , so far , the absence of an in vitro culture system to visualize and model this critical developmental transition has severely limited our understanding of human embryogenesis . Here , we have established a system for the in vitro culture of human embryos that oﬀers a unique opportunity to understand human development after implantation . This system has allowed us to uncover the main morphogenetic events that normally occur after human embryo implantation including : epiblast and hypoblast segregation ; epiblast polarization ; formation of the pro - amniotic cavity and the bilaminar disc ; appearance of the prospective amniotic ectoderm ; appearance of yolk sac ; and diﬀerentiation of the trophoblast into cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast ( Fig . 4f ) . Although this system may not be able to fully recapitulate all of the complex aspects of human embryogenesis in vivo , it has allowed us to reveal a remarkable self - organizing capacity of human blastocysts that has been previously unknown . The next stage in human development corresponds to primitive streak formation but for ethical reasons we are obliged to stop our cultures at day 14 of development or before the primitivestreakformation 12 . Thus , ourstudieshavefocusedonthekey events of pre - gastrulation stages .

NS , not signiﬁcant ( n = 12 hiPSC cysts per condition , 24h time point ; n = 10 hiPSC cysts per condition , 48h time point ) . Data presented in this ﬁgure involved the assessment of a minimum of 10 hESC cysts per panel and per condition across a minimum of 2 independent experiments per panel . but by the epiblast’s polarization , as proposed in monkey embryos 4 . Owing to the limitations to perform functional studies in human embryos , we have used hPSCs as an alternative model to test this hypothesis , and demonstrate that the ECM participates in inducing cell polarization and lumen formation through polarized secretion ( hollowing ) and not programmed cell death ( cavitation ) . This is similar to the mechanism of epiblast polarization we have recently found to operate in mouse embryos 8 . Thus , remarkably , despite the significant diﬀerences in embryo morphology between these diﬀerent mammalian species , the initial steps of post - implantation embryogenesis are evolutionarily conserved . One of the most intriguing aspects of human implantation development is the diﬀerentiation of the epiblast into the epiblast disc and the amniotic epithelium 24 . Interestingly , we could not recapitulate formation of the amniotic epithelium in our 3D hPSC culture possibly because this developmental process requires interaction with extra - embryonic tissues present in the whole embryo . It will be of interest to determine the signalling pathways required for modelling amnion NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 18 | NUMBER 6 | JUNE 2016 © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

Indeed , we anticipate that future studies using the in vitro culture systems we report here for both human embryos and hPSCs will shed new light on the cellular and molecular mechanisms of this mysterious and yet critical stage of human development , which will be of basic and clinical importance .

The exact number of embryos analysed in the diﬀerent conditions , as well as the number of embryos that exhibited a polarized epiblast , is indicated in Supplementary Table 1 . No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size . Given the nature of the work ( mostly descriptive ) , no statistical comparisons were done between diﬀerent embryos . Embryos that showed abnormalities ( fragmented blastomeres or developmentally arrested ) were excluded from the analysis . The investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment . Figure 1 involved the assessment of 5 embryos collected across 3 independent experiments . Out of these 5 embryos 3 showed a correct development . Figure 2 involved the assessment of 20 embryos cultured in 5 % O 2 and collected across 3 independent experiment . All 20 embryos lacked the pluripotent lineage ( phenotype shown in the image ) . Embryos were randomly assigned to either 5 % O 2 or 21 % O 2 . Figures 3 and 4 involved the assessment of 59 embryos collected across 6 independent experiments . Briefly , 29 embryos preserved a cluster of pluripotent cells ; and out of these 29 embryos , 9had an organized epiblast . Figures 5 and 6 involved the assessment of a minimum of 10 hPSC cysts per panel and condition . These were collected across a minimum of 2 independent experiments per panel .
