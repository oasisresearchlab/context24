It has been shown to interact with mutant tau , which can promote neurodegeneration , but nothing is known about the physiological function of EFhd2 in the nervous system . To elucidate this question , we analyzed EFhd2 2 / 2 / lacZ reporter mice and showed that lacZ was strongly expressed in the cortex , the dentate gyrus , the CA1 and CA2 regions of the hippocampus , the thalamus , and the olfactory bulb . Immunohistochemistry and western blotting confirmed this pattern and revealed expression of EFhd2 during neuronal maturation . In cortical neurons , EFhd2 was detected in neurites marked by MAP2 and co - localized with pre - and post - synaptic markers . Approximately one third of EFhd2 associated with a biochemically isolated synaptosome preparation . There , EFhd2 was mostly confined to the cytosolic and plasma membrane fractions . Both synaptic endocytosis and exocytosis in primary hippocampal EFhd2 2 / 2 neurons were unaltered but transport of synaptophysin - GFP containing vesicles was enhanced in EFhd2 2 / 2 primary hippocampal neurons , and notably , EFhd2 inhibited kinesin mediated microtubule gliding . Therefore , we found that EFhd2 is a neuronal protein that interferes with kinesin - mediated transport . Citation : Purohit P , Perez - Branguli F , Prots I , Borger E , Gunn - Moore F , et al .

Introduction Ca 2 + ions are crucial second messengers in synaptic transmis - sion and cytoskeleton function . Ca 2 + binding proteins of different classes play important roles in the brain [ 1 ] . Swiprosin - 1 / EFhd2 ( EFhd2 ) is a proposed Ca 2 + sensor protein expressed abundantly in the brain [ 2 , 3 ] , and was shown to interact with tauP301L [ 4 ] . EFhd2 consists of a N - terminal region of low complexity with an alanine stretch , a functional SH3 binding motif [ 5 ] , two functional EF hands [ 2 , 6 ] and a C - terminal coiled - coil domain [ 7 ] . The coiled - coil domain of recombinant EFhd2 is responsible for self - oligomerization in a Ca 2 + - dependent manner [ 8 ] and for the interaction with mutant tau in brain extracts of JNPL3 mice in vitro [ 9 ] . How EFhd2 may be linked with neurodegenerative diseases is not known , due to the physiological function of EFhd2 being poorly understood . Though it was previously reported that EFhd2 is part of conserved functional cytoskeletal and Ca 2 + feedback loops in B cells and other systems [ 2 , 10 ] , which within neurons would point towards functions in neurite maintenance and / or transport . Anterograde and retrograde axonal transport along microtu - bules ( MTs ) of most cargos is mediated by the motor proteins kinesin and dynein , respectively [ 11 ] . Microtubule associated proteins ( MAP ) assist these processes by stabilizing MTs . The MAP tau directly binds and thus stabilizes MT in axons and microtubule associated protein 2 ( MAP2 ) stabilizes MT in dendrites [ 11 , 12 ] . Defects in synaptic and transport proteins are involved in neurodegenerative diseases by interfering with axonal transport and neural circuit function ( reviewed in [ 13 , 11 ] ) . Axonal branching during physiological axonal regeneration requires local destabilization of the MT cytoskeleton [ 12 ] . This process requires detachment of tau from MTs , which can be mediated by the phosphorylation of tau at many residues [ 12 ] . Therefore , PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 1 August 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 8 | e103976 controlled tau phosphorylation is a critical physiological process and may be linked with EFhd2 [ 4 ] . We therefore tested the hypothesis that EFhd2 controls cytoskeletal functions in neurons using EFhd2 knock - out / lacZ knock - in mice . We found that EFhd2 was strongly expressed in the cortex , hippocampus , thalamus and the olfactory bulb . We revealed that EFhd2 is has a negative impact on transport of synaptophysin - GFP containing vesicles in hippocampal neurons . Specifically , EFhd2 inhibited kinesin mediated microtubule gliding . Taken together , we propose that EFhd2 is a neuronal protein that interferes with kinesin activity . Materials and Methods Chemicals All chemicals were purchased from Sigma - Aldrich ( Deisenho - fen ; Germany ) Merck ( Darmstadt ; Germany ) or Roth ( Karlsruhe ; Germany ) unless stated otherwise . Cell culture medium and supplements were obtained from Invitrogen Life Technologies ( Heidelberg , Germany ) . Mice Mice were maintained and sacrificed in accordance with the European Communities Council Directive of 24 th Nov . 1996 and were approved by the local governmental administration for animal health ( Permit number : 54 . 2531 . 31 - 28 / 08 , government of the administrative region of Mittelfranken ; Genehmigungen zur Haltung genetisch vera¨nderter Tiere , permit number 820 - 8791 . 2 . 41 , government of the administrative region of Unter - franken ) . All efforts were made to minimize suffering . Wild type ( WT ) C57BL / 6 mice at embryonic ( E16 and E18 ) and adult ages ( P150 ) were used . We have generated mice deficient for EFhd2 on a C57Bl / 6 background using stem cells from the trans - NIH Knock - Out Mouse Project ( KOMP , https : / / www . komp . org / ) from Velocigen Regeneron Pharmaceuticals , and described elsewhere [ 14 ] . Immunohistochemistry and b - Galactosidase staining For immunohistochemistry , brains from adult mice ( P150 ) were removed , fixed in 4 % para - formaldehyed ( PFA ) in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) and embedded in paraffine . Tissue sections ( 8 m m ) were deparaffinized and antigen was retrieved [ 15 ] . Briefly , sections were heated for 30 min in a Benchmark - Stainer ( Roche ) in 10 mM Tris , 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 05 % Tween 20 at 95 u C . Sections were then blocked in 1 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) in PBS and incubated with undiluted hybridoma supernatant containing EFhd2 mouse antibody ( mAb ) [ 16 ] and anti - mouse Fc c specific antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase ( HRP , Jackson ) . To visualize b - Galactosidase activity , brains were fixed in 0 . 2 % Glutaraldehyde , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM EDTA in PBS for 1 h at room temperature ( RT ) , washed twice for 30 min in 2 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM EDTA in PBS , and incubated in staining solution ( 2 mM X - Gal , 5 mM potassium hexacyanido ferrate ( II ) , 5 mM potassium hexacyanido ferrate ( III ) , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM EDTA in PBS ) for 2 h at 37 u C . Brains were washed 3 times for 5 min in PBS , fixed over - night ( ON ) in 4 % PFA , and washed 3 times for 15 min in PBS . Then , the brains were incubated for 1 h each in 50 % / 70 % / 80 % ethanol , and analyzed as whole mount or embedded in 4 % agarose and coronally sectioned ( 100 m m ) using a vibratome ( Leica RM2055 ) . Sections were examined with an inverted microscope ( Zeiss Apotome 2 ) using Zeiss Axiovision 4 . 8 software ( Carl Zeiss ) . Primary Cortical Neurons Cortices from mouse embryos at E16 were dissected , chopped into 200 – 500 m m pieces and further mechanically dissociated with siliconated glass pipettes . Neurons were seeded at a density of 1 6 10 5 cells / cm 2 and cultured in Neurobasal culture media ( Invitrogen ) supplemented with L - Glutamine , 2 % B27 and Penicillin - Streptomycin in 5 % CO2 , 95 % humidity at 37 u C . Neurons were transfected with constructs encoding dTomato and EFhd2Myc [ 3 ] using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) following the manufacturer’s instructions . For immunostainings , neurons were fixed in 4 % PFA . Non - specific binding sites were blocked with immunofluorescence buffer ( IFB ; PBS supplemented with 0 . 1 % Triton x - 100 and 5 % normal donkey serum ) for 1 h at RT . Neurons were stained ON with anti - EFhd2 mAb ( 1 : 200 ) . Synapses were labelled with goat anti - synapsin 1a / b antibody ( 1 : 1000 ; Santa Cruz ) , rabbit and goat anti - PSD95 ( postsynaptic density protein 95 ) antibodies ( 1 : 200 each ; Abcam ) , rabbit anti - VAMP2 ( vesicle - associated membrane protein 2 ; 1 : 2000 ; Synapse Systems ) . Neurites were stained with goat anti - tau ( microtubule - associated protein tau ; 1 : 250 ; Santa Cruz ) and rabbit anti - MAP2 ( microtu - bule - associated protein 2 ; 1 : 200 ; Abcam ) . Next , the samples were rinsed several times with PBS supplemented with 0 . 1 % Triton x - 100 , and incubated with suitable fluorescently labelled secondary antibodies ( Invitrogen ) diluted in IFB . After mounting , cells were either analyzed by confocal microscopy ( Zeiss LSM780 , digital resolution 1024 6 1024 ) or with a Zeiss Apotome 2 microscope . The co - localization of EFhd2 with Tau and MAP2 was assessed using ImageJ and Volocity ( Perkin - Elmer ) as previously described in detail [ 17 , 18 ] and is expressed as Pearson’s co - localization co - efficient . Co - localization analysis of EFhd2 / synapsin and EFhd2 / PSD95 was performed with deconvoluted images derived from an Olympus Deltavision microscope ( 60 6 ; NA 1 . 42 ) , using the JACOP plugin in ImageJ ( sbweb . nih . gov / ij / ) , which provides the Pearson’s co - localization co - efficient . Synaptosome preparation by centrifugation Synaptosomes were prepared as previously published [ 18 , 19 ] . Briefly , forebrains from three to four adult mice were dissected out and kept in a cold glass - Teflon homogenizer together with 30 ml of pre - chilled 4 mM Hepes - NaOH ; pH 7 . 3 supplemented with 0 . 32 M sucrose . Tissue homogenization was performed by 10 up - down strokes at 900 rpm and the tissue homogenate was centrifuged at 800 6 g for 10 min at 4 u C . The resulting supernatant ( S1 ) was centrifuged at 10 , 000 6 g for 15 min at 4 u C , resuspended and centrifuged again for 20 min 100000 6 g to obtain pellet 2 ( P2 ) representing the crude synaptosome fraction ( STS ) , and superna - tant ( S2 ) . Synaptosomes were broken by osmotic shock , and the synaptosomal plasmatic membranes ( P3 ; PM ) separated by centrifugation at 25 , 000 6 g for 20 min at 4 u C . The resulting supernatant ( S3 ) was further centrifugated at 30 , 000 6 g ON at 4 u C in order to separate the cytosolic fraction ( S4 ; Cyt ) and the synaptic vesicles fraction ( P4 ; SV ) . Synaptosomal fractions were further analyzed by western blot . Life cell imaging of hippocampal neurons Hippocampal neuronal cultures were prepared from one to three days old EFhd2 + / + and EFhd2 2 / 2 mice [ 14 ] . Newborn mice were killed by decapitation . Hippocampi were removed from the brain and transferred into ice - cold Hank’s salt solution , and the dentate gyrus was removed . After digestion with trypsin ( 5 mg / ml ) , cells were triturated mechanically and plated in MEM medium , supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum and 2 % B27 Supplement ( all Invitrogen ) . Neurons were transfected with synaptophysin - EGFP under control of a synapsin promoter on Function of EFhd2 in Neurons PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 2 August 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 8 | e103976 day 3 in vitro ( DIV ) with a modified calcium phosphate method as described [ 20 , 21 ] . Experiments were performed on day DIV 23 . Imaging was performed as described previously ( Welzel et al . , 2009 ; Welzel et al . , 2011 ) . Experiments were conducted at room temperature on a Nikon TI - Eclipse inverted microscope equipped with a 60 6 , 1 . 2 NA water immersion objective and Perfect Focus System . Fluorescent dyes were excited by a Nikon Intensilight C - HGFI through an excitation filter centered at 482 nm using a dichroic longpass mirror ( cut - off wavelength 500 nm ) . The emitted light passed an emission band - pass filter ranging from 500 – 550 nm ( Semrock , Rochester ) and was projected onto a cooled EM - CCD camera ( iXon DU - 885 , Andor ) . Cover slips were placed into a perfusion chamber ( volume = 500 m l ) containing extracellular medium containing ( in mM ) : 144 NaCl , 2 . 5 KCl , 2 . 5 CaCl 2 , 2 . 5 MgCl 2 , 10 Glucose , 10 Hepes , pH 7 . 5 . Synaptic boutons were stimulated by electric field stimulation ( platinum electrodes , 10 mm spacing , 1 ms pulses of 50 mA and alternating polarity ) ; 10 m M 6 - cyano - 7 - nitroquinoxaline - 2 , 3 - dione ( CNQX , Tocris Bioscience ) and 50 m M D - amino - 5 - phosphonovaleric acid ( D , L - AP5 , Tocris Bioscience ) were added to prevent recurrent activity . Images were recorded with 200 ms exposure time at 1 Hz frame rate . In all experiments resulting image stacks were converted into ICS file format . Kymographs were generated using the dropdown menu ‘‘kymograph’’ in MetaMorph 7 . 5 . 1 . ( MolecularDevices ) . Only straight axonal segments were selected for analysis to avoid velocity artifacts originating from factors such as strong axon covings . Kymographs were analyzed using the Hough transform as described previously ( Welzel et al . , 2011 ) . Protein purification GST fusion proteins encoded in pGEX2T ( GE healthcare ) were induced and purified as described previously [ 2 , 16 ] and dialyzed into appropriate buffers . A truncated form comprising 560 amino acids from the N - terminus and containing the motor domain , neck and part of the stalk of human neuron - specific kinesin - 1 ( KIF5A 560 ) was expressed in E . coli as fusion protein with a C - terminal chitin - binding intein tag and purified by binding to chitin beads followed by removal of the intein - tag by 50 mM DTT - induced specific self - cleavage [ 22 ] . Kinesin was concentrated using Amicon ultra filter units ( Merk Millipore ) and stored in motility buffer ( 50 mM imidazole , 0 . 5 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 5 mM EGTA , 0 . 5 mM DTT , pH 6 . 8 ) supplemented with 150 mM NaCl and 1 M glycerol at 2 80 u C . Tubulin was purified from porcine brain homogenates by two cycles of temperature - dependent disassembly at 0 u C and reassembly at 37 u C . Co - purified MAPs were removed by phosphocellulose ion exchange chromatography [ 23 ] . Stabi - lized MTs were formed by taxol - promoted self - assembly at 37 u C from 2 mg / ml pure tubulin in the MT assembly buffer ( 20 mM PIPES , 80 mM NaCl , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 5 mM MgCl 2 , pH 6 . 8 ) supplemented with 0 . 2 mM GTP and 20 m M taxol . MTs were usually prepared at the day of usage at least 30 min prior to an experiment . The purity of kinesin was 75 – 80 % , the purities of GST , GST - EFhd2 and tubulin were all 95 – 98 % as determined by SDS - PAGE . In vitro gliding assay Gliding assays were performed as described previously [ 24 , 25 ] MTs were assembled and stabilized as described above . All gliding assays were performed with pure KIF5A 560 in motility buffer ( 26 . 5 mM Imidazol , 9 . 4 mM PIPES , 0 . 735 mM EGTA , 0 . 265 mM DTT , 137 . 6 mM NaCl , 1 . 5 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 5 mM ATP , and 0 . 004 mM GTP ) supplemented with 20 m M taxol . The gliding assay mixture containing KIF5A 560 ( 0 . 4 mg / ml ) , stabilized MTs ( 40 m g / ml ) , and GST or GST - EFhd2 at indicated concen - trations was incubated 5 min at room temperature prior transferring it onto casein - coated glass slides . The sample was covered by a cover slip . MT gliding was visualized by video - enhanced differential interference contrast microscopy ; gliding velocities were calculated from at least 10 MTs in each sample using the Argus - 20 software ( Hamamatsu Photonics ) . 100 % correspond to the gliding velocity of 1 . 3 um / sec . All analyses were performed using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope ( Carl Zeiss ) equipped with a Plan - Neofluor 63 6 / 1 . 25 oil immersion objective ( Carl Zeiss ) , a Chalnicon video camera type C2400 - 0 . 1 , and the image processing system Argus - 20 ( both Hamamatsu Photonics ) , which enables background subtraction , and electronic contrast enhancement . Microtubule movement was documented on a digital hard - disk recorder ( JVC SR - DVM70EU , JVC ) . Western blotting Brains were extracted in cold homogenization buffer ( 50 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 ; 2 mM EDTA , 140 mM NaCl ) supplemented with 1 mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) as well as protease and phosphatase inhibitors . After homogenization , samples were centrifuged first at 800 6 g for 10 min . Supernatants ( S1 ) were incubated with 1 % of Triton x - 100 for 30 min on ice and centrifuged at 11 , 000 6 g for 10 min at 4 u C . Neurons were directly lysed in homogenization buffer containing 1 % Triton X - 100 . 5 to 40 m g of total protein were loaded were separated by SDS - PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes . Primary antibodies were incubated ON at 4 u C in Tris - buffered saline and 0 . 1 % Tween20 ( TBST ) supplemented with 3 % BSA ( mouse anti - SNAP - 25 ( clone SMI - 81 ; 1 : 1000 ; Synaptic Systems ) , mouse anti - synaptophysin ( clone p38 ; 1 : 1000 ; Sigma - Aldrich ) ; mouse anti - b 3 - tubulin ( TUJ 1 : 2000 ; Covance ) ; goat anti EFhd2 ( 1 : 500 ; Everest Biotech ) , rabbit anti EFhd2 ( [ 26 ] , 1 m g / ml ) ; goat anti Tau ( 1 : 500 ; Santa Cruz ) were employed to determinate synaptosomal sub - fractions . After several washes with TBST , blots were incubated with corresponding secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and developed by chemical luminescence techniques . Statistical Analysis Data are expressed as mean 6 standard error of the mean ( SEM ) . Statistical analysis was done with the Student’s t - test for unpaired variables ( two - tailed ) when data passed the Kolmogorov - Smirnov Test ( with Dallal - Wilkinson - Lilliefor P value ) or other - wise , as indicated in the figure legends or the main text . Statistics were calculated using GraphPad Prism software . P - values # 0 . 05 were considered significant ( * ) . * * and * * * : p , 0 . 001 and 0 . 0002 , respectively . Results EFhd2 is expressed in the murine cortex and hippocampus To determine the expression of EFhd2 in the adult brain we utilized an EFhd2 2 / 2 knockout / lacZ knock - in mouse strain generated in our laboratory [ 14 ] . In heterozygous animals ( EFhd2 + / 2 ) , one efhd2 allele is replaced by a lacZ reporter gene ( Fig . 1A ) . The lacZ reporter gene downstream of the efhd2 promoter , resulting in b - galactosidase expression , indicates efhd2 mRNA expression , which we have shown to be strong compared to other tissues [ 3 ] . Hence , EFhd2 2 / + and EFhd2 2 / 2 mice express b - galactosidase in the adult brain , while protein levels of EFhd2 are reduced correspondingly ( Fig . 1B ) . Whole mount staining revealed strong b - galactosidase activity in the forebrain ( Fig . 1C ) . To determine efhd2 expression in more detail , we sectioned whole mount stained adult mouse brains coronally Function of EFhd2 in Neurons PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 3 August 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 8 | e103976 Figure 1 .

Prominent dose - dependent b - galactosidase activity indic - ative of efhd2 promoter activity was detected in the deeper layers of the cortex ( IV , V , and VI ) , as well as the dentate gyrus , the CA1 and CA2 areas of the hippocampus . b - galactosidase activity was also observed in the thalamus and the olfactory bulb ( Fig . 1D ) . EFhd2 protein is expressed in embryonic brain tissue and primary cortical neurons Next , we showed the presence of the EFhd2 protein in the cortex , hippocampus , and thalamus of wild - type mouse embryos ( E18 ) and adult tissue ( P150 ) by western blot analysis ( Fig . 2A ) . Importantly , we noted that EFhd2 was expressed in all forebrain areas at embryonic and adult stages ( Fig . 2A ) , the latter of which confirmed previous findings [ 4 ] , but embryonic expression has not been revealed before . As a control , we included non - neuronal tissue ( spleen ) of EFhd2 + / + , 2 / + and 2 / 2 mice , confirming the predominant expression of EFhd2 protein in the adult brain compared to other organs [ 3 ] . Next , we examined the expression of EFhd2 in cortical neurons , where we observed a moderate up - regulation of EFhd2 between DIV1 and DIV13 ( compare EFhd2 expression relative to Actin ) , concomitant with steady up - regulation of tau and the pre - synaptic marker synapsin ( Fig . 2B ) . Hence , EFhd2 is expressed in embryonic and adult brain as well as in primary cortical neurons . The EFhd2 protein was up - regulated roughly two - fold during neuronal maturation in vitro and in parallel with tau . In complete accordance , EFhd2 protein was increased roughly two - fold in adult versus embryonic brain tissue . Immunohistochemistry confirmed the expression of EFhd2 in the pyramidal layers ( layers III – V ) and the multiform layer ( layer VI ) of the cortex ( Fig . 3A ) . Conversely , EFhd2 was never detected in the molecular layer ( layer I ) , the external granular layer ( layer II ) and the white matter ( Fig . 3A ) . The EFhd2 signal was also specific in the granular and pyramidal cell laminas of the hippocampus ( Fig . 3B ) . EFhd2 was associated with cell bodies but apparently not nuclear . A dot - like neuropil staining ( see arrowheads in Fig . 3B ) of EFhd2 was observed in the hippocam - pus of EFhd2 + / + mice but not of EFhd2 2 / 2 mice using anti - EFhd2 mAb A4 . 18 . 18 [ 16 ] . Similar results were obtained with the anti - EFhd2 mAb A4 . 15 . 18 [ 16 ] ( data not shown ) . An isotype matched control antibody ( IgG1 k ) did not reveal a specific staining . The intercellular , dot - like expression of EFhd2 indicated a staining of neurites or synapses , and we next tested these possibilities in cultures of primary neurons . EFhd2 is expressed in neurites marked by tau and MAP2 in murine cortical neurons and is found in proximity to pre - and post - synaptic markers We therefore analyzed localization of EFhd2 in primary cortical neurons by confocal microscopy . The anti - EFhd2 mAb specifically stained the somatodendritic region and neurites in a punctuate fashion ( Fig . 4A ) . This staining resembled the EFhd2 staining pattern observed in situ ( Fig . 3B ) . To determine whether EFhd2 is associated with axons , which was anticipated due to the previously published interaction with tau [ 4 ] , or with dendrites , we performed co - staining of EFhd2 with tau and MAP2 [ 27 ] ( Fig . 4B ) . This experiment revealed a distinct staining of MAP2 in neurites and the somatodendritic cytoplasm . There were also neurites that were only positive for tau ( see arrows in Fig . 4B ) , as the establishment of neuronal polarity , i . e . axon - dendrite specifi - cation , has taken place under the culture conditions we applied [ 27 , 28 ] . Interestingly , EFhd2 revealed a clear co - localization with MAP2 when compared to the isotype control ( Fig . 4B ) . However , EFhd2 was also present in neurites marked with tau . Quantifica - tion of the fluorescence signals showed that EFhd2 was associated with neurites marked by tau to about 30 % , but mostly with neurites marked by MAP2 , to about 50 % ( Fig . 4B ; summary in Fig . 4D ) . The staining results obtained with the anti - EFhd2 mAb ( dominant staining of MAP2 marked neurites ) were confirmed by Myc - staining in neurons transfected with a Myc - tagged EFhd2 protein [ 3 ] ( Fig . 4C ) . We selectively chose neurons that moder - ately over - expressed EFhd2Myc . In summary , EFhd2 is not only associated with tau marked neurites , as might have been inferred from the interaction with mutant tau [ 4 ] , but also with neurites marked by MAP2 as well as the cytoplasm of primary neurons . To further elaborate this result , we investigated whether EFhd2 might be associated with the pre - and postsynaptic markers synapsin 1 a / b and PSD95 by deconvolution microscopy . Indeed , there was a partial co - localization of EFhd2 with the pre - synaptic marker synapsin 1a / b [ 29 ] ( Fig . 5A ) . Quantification revealed that the fluorescence signals of EFhd2 and synapsin 1a / b overlapped with a Pearson’s co - localization coefficient of 0 . 49 . Vice versa , the fluorescence signals of synapsin 1a / b overlapped with EFhd2 signals with a Pearson’s co - localization coefficient of 0 . 55 ( Fig . 5 ) . In addition , EFhd2 was found in close association with PSD - 95 ( Fig . 5B ) , confirming its dendritic localization , but did not directly co - localize ( Pearson’s co - localization coefficients EFhd2 / PSD - 95 : 0 . 31 , PSD - 95 / EFhd2 : 0 . 14 ) . Hence , using two different marker systems ( MAP2 / Tau and Synapsin1 / PSD95 ) we reveal that EFhd2 is localized in neurites . The punctuate staining pattern along neurites , and the staining pattern in situ ( Fig . 3B ) suggested that EFhd2 colocalizes with transport vesicles ; or with synaptic structures ; or both . Hence , EFhd2 could be associated with transport vesicles delivering synaptic proteins but also be a synaptic protein . These possibilities are not mutually exclusive . EFhd2 is associated with the cytosolic and plasma membrane fractions of biochemically isolated synaptosomes To test the possibility that EFhd2 is associated with synapses , we analyzed synaptosomes prepared by differential centrifugation [ 18 , 19 ] from brains of adult EFhd2 + / + and EFhd2 2 / 2 mice . First , we assessed to which extent EFhd2 could associate with this biochemically isolated brain fraction . To this end we analyzed the amount of EFhd2 protein present in the pelleted fraction ( P2 – STS [ synaptosomes ] ) that was further used to obtain the different synaptosome fractions and the fraction S2 ( not used for further analysis ) . Whereas the cytosolic protein b 3 - tubulin was only to 26 % in the P2 fraction , the synaptic marker synaptophysin was present much more , and EFhd2 was present to 37 % , indicating that a substantial part of EFhd2 can associate with biochemically prepared synaptosomes ( Fig . 6A ) . Next , we assessed where in synaptosomes EFhd2 was located . Therefore , the fraction P2 synaptosomes were separated into cytosolic ( Cyt ) , synaptic vesicle ( SV ) and plasma membrane ( PM ) fractions . Using protein markers for specific fractions , namely b 3 - tubulin - cytosolic fraction , synaptophysin - synaptic vesicle fraction and SNAP25 - plasma membrane [ 29 ] , we revealed that EFhd2 is present mostly in the cytosolic and synaptic plasma membrane compartments . The abundance of the synaptic proteins synaptophysin and SNAP25 was unchanged between EFhd2 2 / 2 mice and controls ( Fig . 6B ) . Taken together , these data revealed that a fraction of EFhd2 is localized in biochemically isolated synapses [ 19 ] . We did not control these fractions by electron microscopy as in the original publication . Importantly , however , synapsin , s a synaptic marker , is also found in these preparations [ 19 ] and we found that EFhd2 co - localizes with synapsin ( Fig . 4A ) in matured primary neuronal cultures [ 27 ] .

Ultrastructural analyses in vitro and in situ will be necessary to address the question of specific synaptic abundance or accumulation of EFhd2 in the future .

Therefore , we measured synaptic transport by expressing a synaptophysin - GFP fusion protein , coupled to an automated image acquisition and analysis device [ 21 ] , in primary hippocampal neurons of EFhd2 + / + and EFhd2 2 / 2 mice . Interestingly , net axonal transport and percentages of moving particles were significantly increased in the absence of EFhd2 , whereas the pausing time was not affected ( Fig . 7A , B ) . Thus , lack of EFhd2 increased the speed of axonal transport . We next asked , whether EFhd2 decreased axonal transport by inhibition of the plus end microtubule motor protein kinesin [ 11 ] .

These data indicated that kinesin mediated transport was modulated in the presence of EFhd2 . We therefore measured the ATPase activity of KIF5A in the absence or presence of recombinant GST - EFhd2 . We did not observe a significant inhibition of kinesin mediated ATPase activity by GST - EFhd2 ( data not shown ) . Thus , EFhd2 slowed kinesin mediated MT gliding , which might be a consequence of reduced kinesin - MT interaction . Discussion Strong EFhd2 expression in the brain was detected in the grey matter , including the cortex and hippocampus . Thus , the lacZ expression pattern in EFhd2 - gene targeted mice and anti - EFhd2 immunohistochemistry outlined a specific EFhd2 expression in the pyramidal layers of the cortex , in the dentate gyrus , and in the CA1 - CA2 regions of the hippocampus . These findings are in line with the in situ hybridizations described in the Allen brain atlas Figure 7 . Inhibitory effects of EFhd2 on microtubule motor mediated transport in cellular and cell - free systems .

The average velocities are 59 . 98 2 / + 16 . 76 nm / s ( EFhd2 2 / 2 ; 25 kymographs ) vs . 47 . 06 2 / + 12 . 73 nm / s ( EFhd2 + / + ; 10 kymographs ) ( mean 2 / + SD ; p = 0 . 0063 , two tailed t - test ) .

Brain regions that mostly consist of white matter ( e . g . the corpus callosum ) do not show efhd2 expression ( see Allan Brain Atlas , Experiment 69671911 ) . Interestingly , these findings were also confirmed in microarrays from human brain ( Allan Brain Atlas , EFhd2 human microarrays ) . In the developing embryo , we show for the first time that the EFhd2 protein is expressed in the cortex , hippocampus , and thalamus of E18 brain , indicative of expression of EFhd2 during brain development . EFhd2 was also expressed in primary cortical neurons and became up - regulated during neuronal differentiation in a biphasic manner . This might be an indication that EFhd2 is involved in specific neuronal differentiation processes . Along this line , tau also plays an important physiological role during axon branching and in synaptic plasticity and EFhd2 has been shown to interact with a mutant form of tau [ 4 ] . Increased levels of EFhd2 correlated with the presence of an additional band of tau . Thus , a possible interplay between tau and EFhd2 may functionally affect certain specific aspects of neuronal development [ 12 ] . To unravel potential functions of EFhd2 in the central nervous system , we studied the intracellular localization of EFhd2 . We found EFhd2 expressed in fine granular structures in the neuropil throughout the CNS with prominent expression in regions that contain dense neuronal populations in rodents and human brain ( e . g . in the hippocampus ) , while EFhd2 expression was absent in EFhd2 2 / 2 mice . We also found co - labelling of EFhd2 with axonal and dendritic markers in cortical neurons . A co - localization of roughly 40 % was observed for EFhd2 with pre - synaptic markers . Co - staining of EFhd2 with synaptic markers was indicative of a potential role in synaptic transmission . This finding led us to investigate EFhd2 expression in synaptosomes . We detected EFhd2 in biochemically isolated synaptosomes , with the highest abundance in the cytosolic fraction . Other proteins that are predominantly found in the cytosolic fraction , for example amphiphysin , function in synaptic vesicle endocytosis [ 32 ] . Analysis of the Drosophila homolog of EFhd2 ( DSwip ) also revealed a potential role in cell - cell communication : DSwip accumulates transiently in foci at the contact sites of fusing myoblasts and either directly or indirectly regulates calcium - dependent exocytosis of the electron - dense vesicles of the pre - fusion complex in myoblasts [ 33 ] . Taking these data into consideration , we next analyzed synaptic exocytosis and endocy - tosis in EFhd2 2 / 2 mice , but did not find any significant difference compared to the control group . This finding might be explained by redundancy of other proteins involved in vesicle exocytosis in the nervous system . For example , even depletion of synaptophysin , a major synaptic vesicle protein involved in endocytosis of synaptic vesicles , does not result in major differences in phenotype or neurotransmitter release [ 34 – 36 ] . In line with the proposed function of DSwip , however , the yet to be molecularly defined association of EFhd2 with vesicular structures might be compatible with a function in establishing and breaking down contact between pre - and post - synaptic membrane structures [ 11 , 12 ] , that is , synaptic plasticity . The distribution of EFhd2 in neurites marked both with tau and MAP2 suggested a universal role in neurites . To our surprise we found an increase in transport velocity and an increase in the number of moving particles in EFhd2 2 / 2 mice . The idea of EFhd2 as a regulator of axonal transport is fully compatible with a possible function of EFhd2 in establishing and breaking down contacts between pre - and post - synaptic membrane structures [ 11 ] . In addition , the strongest expression of EFhd2 was found in the cytosolic fraction of our biochemically isolated synaptosome preparation . In this fraction , also cytoskeleton markers like b 3 - tubulin are highly abundant . These data are compatible with EFhd2 being part of a conserved regulatory cytoskeletal network [ 10 , 37 ] . To address this possibility further , we aimed to identify in a cell free system the proteins that functionally interact with EFhd2 . KIF5A - induced MT gliding was decelerated by addition of a GST - EFhd2 fusion protein to this system , indicating a dose - dependent functional interaction between EFhd2 and KIF5A . A potential mechanism of the interference with kinesin activity towards MTs could be inhibition of MT binding to kinesin by EFhd2 . EFhd2 might also exert effects on dynein ( MT minus end motor ) , specifically since differential regulation of dynein and kinesin motor proteins by locally altered concentrations of tau have been described earlier [ 38 ] . On the other hand , neither tau - deficient nor tau - overexpressing mice do show alterations of axonal transport in vivo [ 39 ] . Thus , alternatively and not mutually exclusive , EFhd2 might in neurons also interact with components of the actin cytoskeleton [ 8 , 10 , 40 ] , like gelsolin does , which inhibits axonal transport in a Ca 2 + dependent manner [ 41 ] . In our hands , EFhd2 2 / 2 mice did not develop any obvious neuronal phenotype . How can this be reconciled with a proposed role for EFhd2 in tauopathies [ 4 , 9 ] , such as Alzheimer’s disease [ 42 ] ? Normal mice do not develop neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and thus , transgenic mouse models are being used to mimick certain aspects of human neurodegenera - tion . Hence , it is not surprising that EFhd2 2 / 2 mice do not develop an obvious phenotype in that respect . However , the phenotype of induced neurodegeneration , or other neurologic diseases ( for review see [ 7 ] ) , upon genetic or environmental challenge , might be modulated in one or the other direction in the absence of EFhd2 . For instance , reduction of endogenous tau protein ameliorates onset of disease in an amyloid - beta transgenic mouse model [ 43 ] . Alterations in both anterograde as well as retrograde transport are sufficient to induce neurodegeneration [ 44 ] . Thus it is tempting to speculate that EFhd2 might be involved in transport of cargo relevant for neurodegenerative diseases , in combination with or without tau . Hence our data will in the future contribute to more specifically testing the hypotheses that EFhd2 is involved 1 ) in tauopathies [ 4 , 9 ] with regard to intracellular transport , and 2 ) in establishment of synaptic plasticity . Taken together , we reveal here for the first time the wide spread neuronal expression of EFhd2 and propose that EFhd2 is a neuronal protein controlling basal neuronal functions exerted through kinesin .
