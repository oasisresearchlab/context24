ANALYTICAL BIOCHEMISTRY 72 , 248 - 254 ( 1976 ) A Rapid and Sensitive Method for the Quantitation of Microgram Quantities of Protein Utilizing the Principle of Protein - Dye Binding R e productio n Research Laboratorirs , Departme n t of Bioc he mistry , Univer sity of Georgia , Athens , Georgia 30602 Received September 11 . 1975 ; accepted January 29 . 1976 A protein determination method which involves the binding of Coomassie Brilliant Blue G - 250 to protein is described . The binding of the dye to protein causes a shift in the absorption maximum of the dye from 365 to 595 nm . and it is the increase in absorption at 595 nm which is monitored . This assay is very reproducible and rapid with the dye binding process vi rt ually complete in approximately 2 min with good color stability for I hr . There is little or no interference from cations such as sodium or potassium nor from carbohydrates such as sucrose . A s mall amount of color is developed in the presence of strongly alkaline buffering agents , but the assay may be run accurately by the use of proper buffer controls . The only components found to give excessive interfering color in the assay are relatively large amounts of detergents such as sodium dodecyl sulfate , Triton X - 100 , and commercial glassware detergents . Interference by small amounts of detergent may be eliminated by the use of proper controls . Laboratory practice in protein purification often requires a rapid and sensitive method for the quantitation of protein . Methods presently available partially fulfill the requirement for this type of quantitation . The standard Lowry procedure ( 1 ) is subject to interference by com - pounds such as potassium ion ( 2 ) , magnesium ion ( 3 ) , EDTA ( 4 ) , Tris ( 3 ) t hiol reagents ( 2 ) , and carbohydrates ( 5 ) . The relatively insensitive biuret reaction ( 6 ) is subject to interference by Tris ( 7 ) , ammonia ( 8 ) , and glycerol ( 9 ) . Even the modified procedure for eliminating problems with the Lowry and biuret assays ( 10 , ll ) present problems since more complications and time are involved in the modified procedures . The dye binding techniques in the literature are for the most part insensitive assays involving the binding of Orange G to protein ( 12 - 16 ) . The excep - tion to this rule is the Amidoschwarz 10 - B binding assay ( 17 ) . This procedure , too , has its drawbacks since the precipitation of the protein by trichloroacetic acid followed by filtration on Millipore membranes is required . The protein assay herein described eliminates most of the problems involved in the procedures described above , and is easily utilized for 248 Copyright 0 1976 by Academic Press , Inc .

It is based on the observation that Coomassie Brilliant Blue G - 250 exists in two different color forms , red and blue ( 18 ) . The red form is con - verted to the blue form upon binding of the dye to protein ( 18 ) . The protein - dye complex has a high extinction coefficient thus leading to great sensitivity in measurement of the protein . The binding of the dye to pro - tein is a very rapid process ( approximately 2 min ) , and the protein - dye complex remains dispersed in solution for a relatively long time ( approx - imately 1 hr ) , thus making the procedure very rapid and yet not requiring critical timing for the assay . MATERIALS AND METHODS Reagents . Coomassie Brilliant Blue G - 250 was obtained from Sigma , and used as supplied . 2 - Mercaptoethanol was obtained from Sigma . Triton X - 100 was obtained from Schwar tz / Mann . Sodium dodecyl sulfate was obtained from BDH Chemicals Ltd . , Poole , England . Hemosol was obtained from Scientific Products . All other reagents were of analytical grade or the best grade available . Protein prepar ation . Bovine serum albumin ( 2x crystallized ) , chymo - trypsinogen A , and cytochrome c ( horse heart ) were obtained from Schwart z / Mann . Hemoglobin and human serum albumin were obtained from Nutritional Biochemicals Corporation . Protein solutions were pre - pared in 0 . 15 M NaC l . Concentrations were determined for bovine serum albumin , human serum albumin , c h ymotrypsinogen A , and cytochrome c spectrophotometrically in a Bausch and Lomb Spectronic 200 uv spectrophotometer based on la = 6 . 6 ( 19 , 20 ) , 5 . 3 ( 19 , 21 ) , 20 ( 19 , 22 ) and 17 . 1 ( 23 , 24 ) respectively . Hemoglobin solutions were prepared gravimetrically . Preparation of protei n reagent . Coomassie Brilliant Blue G - 250 ( 100 mg ) was dissolved in 50 ml 95 % ethanol . To this solution 100 ml 85 % ( w / v ) phosphoric acid was added . The resulting solution was diluted to a final volume of I liter . Final concentrations in the reagent were 0 . 01 % ( w / v ) Coomassie Brilliant Blue G - 250 , 4 . 7 % ( w / v ) ethanol , and 8 . 5 % ( w / v ) phosphoric acid . Protein assay ( standard method ) . Protein solution containing 10 to 1 00 pg protein in a volume up to 0 . 1 ml was pipetted into 12 x 100 mm test tubes . The volume in the test tube was adjusted to 0 . 1 ml with appropriate buffer . Five milliliters of protein reagent was added to the test tube and the contents mixed either by inversion or vortexing . The absorbance at 595 nm was measured after 2 min and before I hr in 3 ml cuvettes against a reagent blank prepared from 0 . 1 ml of the appropriate buffer and 5 ml of protein reagent . The weight of protein was plotted against the corresponding absorbance resulting in a standard curve used to determine the protein in unknown samples . 250 MARION M . BRADFORD Microprotein a ss a y . Protein solution containing 1 to 10 pg protein in a volume up to 0 . 1 ml was pipetted into 12 x 100 mm test tubes . The volume of the test tubes was adjusted to 0 . 1 ml with the appropriate buffer . One milliliter of protein reagent was added to the test tube and the contents mixed as in the standard method . Absorbance at 595 nm was measured as in the standard method except in 1 ml cuvettes against a reagent blank prepared from 0 . 1 ml of the appropriate buffer and 1 ml of protein reagent . Standard curves were prepared and used as in the standard method . RESULTS Reprod u cibility , sensitivity , and linearity of the assay . Triplicate standard assays of bovine serum albumin as a standard result in a highly reproducible response pattern . Statistical analysis gives a standard devia - tion of 1 . 2 % of mean value for the assay . There is extreme sensitivity in the assay with 25 pg sample giving an absorbance change of 0 . 275 OD units . This corresponds to 5 pg prote in / ml in the final assay volume . There is a slight nonlinearity in the response pattern . The source of the nonlinearity is in the reagent itself since there is an overlap in the spectrum of the two different color forms of the dye . The background value for the reagent is continually decreasing as more dye is bound to protein . This presents no real problem since the degree of curvature is only slight . If the assay is run with a set of standards and unknowns measured against the response curve of the standards instead of calculated by Beer ' s Law , there is no difficulty in obtaining satisfactory results . Accuracy of the assay . Figure 1 shows the results of various proteins assayed in the system as to individual responses . There is a scattering of points around the line drawn in the graph . The scattering is believed to be a multifaceted function composed of difficulties in determining the exact amount of protein present in a given sample due to variation of extinction coefficients in the literature , the methods used to determine the exact amount of protein used in measuring extinction coefficients , and some degree of variation in the efficiency of dye binding to various proteins . Figure 2 shows the response pattern obtained from Lowry ( 1 ) assays of the same proteins . The degree of scatter in protein response to Lowry ( 1 ) assay is similar to that shown for the dye - binding assay presented here . The sensitivity of the Lowry ( 1 ) method is an absorbance of 0 . 110 OD units for the 25 pg standard corresponding to 8 pg protei n / ml of final assay volume . By calculation , then , the dye binding assay is approximately four times more sensitive than the Lowry ( 1 ) assay . The degree of scatter around the Lowry ( 1 ) assay plot also points to the difficulty in establishing a quantitative value for a protein in standard solutions . Stability of the protein - dye complex color . Figure 3 shows the rate of PROTEIN ASSAY BY DYE BINDING Protein ug Protein dye binding response pattern for various proteins . formation of protein - dye complex in the assay system and the stability of the color complex . The absorbance was monitored at 7 . 5 sec intervals for 2 min and then at 1 min intervals for a period of 1 hr . As seen from the graph . the color development is essentially complete at 2 min , and re - mains stable plus or minus 4 % for a period of 1 hr . Since the protein - dye complex has a tendency to aggregate with time , there is a decrease in color after this period of time simply by the physical removal of the prcrein - dye complex from solution .

This still gives ample time to read a relatively large number of samples . Microassay system sensitivity . When bovine serum albumin is used as the standard in the micro assay system the degree of nonlinearity is similar to that found in the standard assay . There is a loss in protein - dye complex response as compared with the standard assay , i . e . . 5 pg protein / ml gives an absorbance change of 0 . 1 vs 0 . 27 in the standard as - say . Perhaps this results from increased dilution of the protein reagent . Interference by nonprotein components . As indicated earlier , there is some interference in the assay system by strongly alkaline buffering agents . This may be overcome by running the appropriate buffer con - trols and subtracting the value for the control either mathematically o r spectrophotometricall y . A wide spectrum of components was tested for effects on the protein dye binding assay ( Table 1 ) . A lack of effect on the assay by magnesium chloride , potassium chloride , sodium chloride , ethanol , and ammonium sulfate was observed . The small effects due to Tris , acetic acid , 2 - mercaptoethanol , sucrose , glycerol , EDTA , and trace quantities of the detergents , Triton X - 100 , sodium dodecyl sulfate , and Hemosol , can be easily eliminated by running the proper buffer control with the assay . However , the presence of large quantities of the deter - gents present abnormalities too great to overcome .

A difficulty observed in performing the assay is the tendency of the protein - dye complex in solution to bind to cuvettes . This results in a blue colored cuvette . The amount of binding is negligible as far as assay read - ings are concerned , i . e . , less than 1 % error . as indicated by the stand - ard deviation of triplicate assays in the reproducibility section . The blueness of the cuvettes after assay does present problems in other uses of the cuvettes so the following directions for cleaning the blue complex from cuvettes is included : Method 1 : Rinse cuvettes with concentrated glassware detergent , followed by water and acetone . ( Gives immediate removal . ) Method 2 : Soak cuvettes in 0 . 1 M HCL . ( Removes complex in a few hours . ) The binding of the protein - dye complex has been observed only with quartz cuvettes and may be eliminated by using either glass or plastic cuvettes .
