INTRODUCTION PROBLEMS OF SOCIAL CHOICE frequently take the following form . There are n voters and a set K = { 1 , 2 , . . . , k } of objects . These objects may be bills consid - ered for adoption by a legislature , candidates considered for membership in a club , etc . The voters must choose ( adopt ) a subset of the set of objects . Assume that each voter has a linear order of the 2k possible subsets that can be adopted . A voting scheme is a method for passing from n - tuples of these linear orders , called preference profiles , to sets of objects . A scheme is dictatorial if there is some voter whose preferred choice is always selected , no matter what the preferences of other voters . A scheme is manipulable if , for some profile of individual preferences , a voter can obtain an outcome set that he prefers by misrepresenting his true preferences . Applied to this framework , the Gibbard - Satterthwaite theorem says that if there is more than one issue to consider for adoption , then all nonmanipulable schemes are dictatorial . 2 ( An additional hypothesis is required : the range of the scheme must contain at least three sets of objects . ) In this paper we provide a response to the Gibbard - Satterthwaite theorem that is of the same form as the one provided by Groves and Clarke in their classic papers on the free - rider problem . For social choice problems in which the interpretation of an outcome is a public decision and a vector of money transfers , and preferences are of the transferable utility form , the Groves - Clarke mechanisms are nonmanipulable . Furthermore , they are the only nonmanipula - ble mechanisms on the domain of transferable utility preferences . Here we prove parallel results for the problem of selecting subsets from a set K of objects . We define a class of mechanisms called voting by committees and observe that on an important domain of preferences they are nonmanipulable . 1The work of S .

A familiar special case of voting by committees is voting by quota . In the quota system with quota Q ( ( 1 < Q < n ) , the ith voter ( 1 < i < n ) votes a subset of the objects Ai c K and the outcome is the set of objects that belong to at least Q of the sets Ai . This type of voting is used explicitly by some clubs when electing new members : a candidate for membership is elected if his name is checked on some predetermined number ( say Q ) of ballots . A reduced form of voting by quota operates in many legislative bodies . Elected representatives normally vote on a large number of issues each year . Although the issues are in practice confronted one by one , with , for example , support by two - thirds of the legislators needed for adoption , it is as if all legislators announce at once the issues they support ( this might follow some logrolling ) and as if issues an - nounced by two - thirds of the legislators are then adopted . Voting by quota is a particular way of describing which coalitions of voters are winning , in the sense that they can force an object into the final outcome set . A more general class of voting scheme can be described by specifying a family of winning coalitions for each object and then including an object into the outcome set if and only if the set of voters who favor it constitutes a winning coalition . ( We assume that if a coalition is winning , then so are its supersets . ) This device of specifying voters and winning coalitions is standard in game theory and is known as a ( monotonic ) simple game , or a committee . Thus , the voting scheme just described , which uses a committee to choose each object , is called voting by committees . The key result of this paper is a characterization of voting by committees . 3 We now specify the domain of preferences that will be considered . For a preference relation defined on the subsets of K , we will call an object " good " if it is preferred to the empty set . A preference relation is separable if for any set A cK , and any object x 9 A , { x } UA is preferred to A if and only if x is good . As a special case , preferences are separable when they have an additive representation . 4 Since separability requires a degree of independence among objects , interaction effects lead to its failure . A conservative legislator may favor the passage of either of two laws by itself ( { x } > 0 , and { y } > 0 ) ; the adoption of two together might , in his opinion , represent an intolerable change from the 3There is some similarity between voting by committees and approval voting , a method that has been studied in detail by Brams and Fishburn ( 1982 ) . They are similar in that in both methods voters submit a set of objects . However , they are different in virtually every other respect , since the social choice in approval voting is a single object and since approval voting is in general manipulable ( after one introduces a tie - breaker rule so that it is well - defined ) . 4A preference relation > on 2K is additively representable if there exists a function U : K u 0 - R , with U ( 0 ) = O such that for all A , B c K , A > B if andonlyif , U ( z ) > , U ( z ) . zeA zEB An important case in which this condition will be satisfied is when ( a ) each object can be gauged according to a finite number ( say n ) of characteristics , ( b ) preferences over bundles of characteris - tics are represented by a differentiable function U , and ( c ) objects are infinitesimal changes from a status quo x . VOTING BY COMMITTrEES 597 status quo ( 0 > { x , y } ) . Therefore , his preference relation is not separable . If you believe that the appointment of Professor Glutz or Professor Smith would be preferred to nobody being appointed , but you believe that appointing both of them together would be a disaster since it would tear your institute apart , then your preferences are not separable . It is easy to see that voting by committees is not manipulable on the domain of separable preferences . 5 To see this , fix a profile of preferences and let S denote the set of objects that will be included in the outcome set independently of how the ith voter votes . If voter i has a separable preference relation , then his most preferred subset is his set of good objects , and he would like to add as many of them to S as possible . By truthfully reporting his preferred subset under voting by committees , i adds to S all the objects that he considers good among those he can add . With separable preference this is the best he can do . In addition to nonmanipulability over separable preferences , voting by commit - tees satisfies the classical property of voter sovereignty : no subset of objects is a priori barred from emerging as the outcome . We can now be more specific about our characterization of voting by commit - tees . It is the only method for passing from n - tuples of individual preferences to sets of objects that satisfies voter sovereignty and nonmanipulability on the domain of separable preferences . Voting by quota is then easily characterized as the subclass of voting by committee methods that satisfies the additional classical requirements of anonymity and neutrality . Anonymity guarantees the symmetric treatment of individuals , and it formalizes the requirement of " one man one vote . " Neutral - ity means that each object is given a free hand to emerge and that one object is not favored over another simply because of its " name . " Under voting by quota , winning coalitions are determined by size only , not by the names of the voters , and the same committee is used for all objects . The paper proceeds as follows . In Section 2 , we introduce notation , defini - tions , and the main theorems . Then in Section 3 we prove that voting by committees is manipulable on any domain larger than that of separable prefer - ences . Finally , in Section 4 we study the efficiency property of voting by committees . 2 . A CHARACTERIZATION OF VOTING BY COMMITTEES 2 . 1 . Notation and the Statements of the Main Theorems The set of voters is N = { 1 , 2 , . . . , n } . The set of objects is K = { 1 , 2 , . . . , k } . We assume that n and k are at least 2 . 6 Subsets of K are denoted by 5Notice that with separable preferences all triples of sets of objects are free . Thus , there does not exist a social welfare function on this domain that satisfies Arrow ' s axioms . This should be a warning against misinterpretations of results by Satterthwaite ( 1975 ) , Kalai and Muller ( 1979 ) , and others , regarding the close connection between the possibilities of defining Arrowian social welfare functions and strategy - proof decision schemes on a domain . 6 Our main results can also cover the cases n = 1 or k = 1 . We exclude these trivial cases for ease of exposition since including them would require minor changes in some of our statements . 598 SALVADOR BARBERA , HUGO SONNENSCHEIN , AND LIN ZHOU A , A ' , B , B ' , S , T , . . . , with the empty set denoted by 0 . The ith voter ' s prefer - ence relations , denoted by > i , > i ' , etc . , is an ( asymmetric ) ordering on 2K ( the set of subsets of K ) . 7 Let P denote the set of all orderings on 2K . Given > , a preference relation in P , and & , a class of subsets of K , argmax ( > , & ) denotes the best element of > on & ; that is , argmax ( > , 9 ) > B for all A E & , A 0 argmax ( > , & ) . We consider voting schemes that have each voter order the 2k subsets of objects and for each n - tuple of such orderings produce an outcome of a set of objects . Formally , we have the following definition . DEFINITION 1 : A voting scheme f is a function from P ' to 2 It is important for both theoretical and practical purposes to search for voting schemes that are simple to execute and also possess certain desirable features . We believe that the class of schemes of voting by committees is very attractive on both accounts . DEFINITION 2 : A committee ( or a monotonic simple game ) is a pair C = ( N , W ) , where N = { 1 , . . . , n } is the set of voters , W is a nonempty set of nonempty coalitions of N , which satisfies [ McE W and M ' DMI - * M ' c W . Coalitions in W are called winning . M E W is a minimal winning coalition if and only if M ' cM - * M ' O W ( M ' cM means M ' cM and M ' M ) . Let B ( > ) denote the best element of 2K according to > : B ( > ) = argmax ( > , 2K ) . DEFINITION 3 : A voting scheme f : P ' n > 2K iS voting by committees , if for each object x , there exists a committee Cx = ( N , Wx ) such that : for all profiles ( > 1 , > 2g . . * * > n ) , X E ff ( > 1 , > 2 . . . , > n ) if and only if { i lx c B ( > i ) } c Wx . One nice feature of voting by committees is that it depends only on the subset of K ranked highest by each voter ; that is , it is of the form f : ( 2K ) n - > 2K . It is certainly more economical to execute a scheme of this form than a scheme that requires information about every detail of voter ' s preferences . Other attractive features of voting by committees include its resistance to manipulation and its respect for voters ' preferences . A voting scheme is strategy - proof if it is always in the best interest of voters to reveal their actual preferences . The formal definition of strategy - proofness qualifies the above statement by introducing a relevant domain R = R1 X R2 x . . . XRn . DEFINITION 4 : A voting scheme f : p n > 2K iS manipulable on R at ( > 1 , > 2 . . > n ) ER by iEN via > ' eR - if f ( > 1 , > 2 , > ' . . . > n ) > if ( > 1 , 7 Requiring strict preference is not too restrictive when K is finite . VOTING BY COMMITrEES 599 > 2 , . . > n ) . As a shorthand , we sometimes simply say that f is manipulable on R . A voting scheme f is strategy - proof on R if it is not manipulable on R . DEFINITION 5 : A voting scheme f : pn 2K satisfies voter sovereignty on R if for each A cK there exists ( > 1 , > 2 . . . , > n ) eR such that f ( > 1 , > 2 , . . . , > n ) = A . Of course , by the Gibbard - Satterthwaite theorem , voting by committees is manipulable on pn . We are interested in the restricted domains on which voting by committees becomes strategy - proof . One such restriction is introduced in the following manner . A voter can evaluate each object separately from the other objects . For each > E P , let G ( > ) = { x E KJ { x } > 0 ) be called the set of good objects , and its complement GC ( > ) the set of bad objects . DEFINITION 6 : A preference relation > E P is separable if for all A c K and all x OA , A u { x } > A if and only if x E G ( > ) . The set of all separable preferences is denoted by Ps . Notice that additive representability implies separability ( see footnote 3 for the definition of additive representability ) . The converse is not true with more than two objects . For example , the preference relation > : { x , y , z } > { x , y } > { x , z } > { y , z } > { z } > { y } > { x } > 0 is separable but not additively repre - sentable . Also notice that whenever > is separable , B ( > ) = G ( > ) : the best set is the set of all good objects . It is easy to check that voting by committees is strategy - proof on ( pS ) n and satisfies voter sovereignty . More importantly , our main theorem states that voting by committees is the only method to have these two properties . THEOREM 1 : A voting scheme f : ( pS ) n 2K is strategy - proof on ( pS ) n and satisfies voter sovereignty if and only if it is voting by committees . Theorem 1 is tight . In particular , the requirement of voter sovereignty cannot be dispensed with . For example , consider the voting scheme f under which voter 1 always gets the single object he most prefers . Clearly , it does not satisfy voter sovereignty . Although f is strategy - proof , it is not voting by committees . Next we specialize our result to anonymous and neutral voting schemes . DEFINITION 7 : A voting scheme f is anonymous if f ( > 1 , > 2 . . . , > n ) - f ( > cr ( l ) , > o ( 2 ) , . , > oJ ( n ) ) for all ( > 1 , > 2 . . . , I > n ) Cpn and all permutations o of N . DEFINITION 8 : A voting scheme f is neutral if f ( / . t ( > 1 ) , , u / ( > 2 ) , . . . , ( > d ) ) p ( f ( > 1 , > 2 . . . , > n ) ) for all ( > 1 , > 2 , * . > n ) E pn and any permutation , A of K . A ( > ) is the ordering obtained from > by permuting the objects according to , u . 600 SALVADOR BARBERA , HUGO SONNENSCHEIN , AND LIN ZHOU DEFINITION 9 : A voting scheme f : P ' n - * 2K is voting by quota if there exists Q between 1 and n such that for all ( > i , > 2 . . . , > n ) , we have x ef ( > 1 , > 2 . . . . > n ) if and only if # { ijx E B ( > i ) } > Q . ( # L denotes the number of the elements in L . ) Voting by quota Q is a special case of voting by committees in which there is one single committee C = ( N , WQ ) for all objects and winning coalitions are determined by their sizes . The following corollary of Theorem 1 completely characterizes voting by quota . COROLLARY 1 : A voting scheme f : ( pS ) n - * 2K satisfies anonymity , neutrality , voter sovereignty , and is strategy - proof on Ps if and only if it is voting by quota . We highlight the implication of our result for the anonymous and neutral case because the resulting methods of voting by quota are simple and intuitive . Of course , many important decision processes can be represented by voting by committees but not voting by quota . Voting mechanisms in the U . N . Security Council and the U . S . Congress illustrate this point . The last remark we want to make is that Theorem 1 and its corollary still hold when the domain of separable preferences is replaced by that of additively representable preferences . 8 THEOREM 2 : A voting scheme f : ( pA ) n - * 2K is strategy - proof on ( pA ) n and satisfies voter sovereignty if and only if it is voting by committees . COROLLARY 2 : A voting scheme f : ( pA ) n - * 2K satisfies anonymity , neutrality , voter sovereignty , and is strategy - proof on ( pA ) n if and only if it is voting by quota . 2 . 2 . Proofs of the Theorems As mentioned above , voting by committees , although formally defined on preference n - tuples , does not require complete specifications of voters ' prefer - ence relations . If f is voting by committees , then it depends only on the voters ' most preferred sets . We call this property " tops only , " and use the following notation : f : ( 2 K ) 2 We first characterize all strategy - proof voting schemes in this restricted subclass . The distinct feature of this characterization is that it does not require any condition other than strategy - proofness . Notice that in general a strategy - proof voting scheme can be such that some object is never elected , or some other always elected . To allow for these possibilities , we extend slightly our 8Although pA is a subset of ps , Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 are logically independent . VOTING BY COMMITTEES 601 previous notion of a committee , admitting an empty set of winning coalitions or the empty coalition of voters as a winning coalition . DEFINITION 10 : A generalized committee is a pair C = ( N , W ) , where N = { 1 , . . . , n } is the set of voters , W is a set of coalitions of N , which satisfies [ MEc W and M ' DM ] - * M ' E W . We can now state the following lemma . LEMMA 1 : A voting scheme f : ( 2K ) n - * 2K is strategy - proof on ( pS ) n if and only if it is voting by generalized committees , i . e . , for each object x in K , there is a generalized committee Cx = ( N , Wx ) such that X ef ( S1 , S2 ' . . . I Sn ) ' U { ilX E B ( > i ) } E WX . PROOF : ( i ) First , if X Ef ( S1 , . . . , Si . . . Sn ) and xcE Si , then xcE Ti implies x Ef ( S1 , . . . , i , . . . , Sn ) . This is because we can always find a separable prefer - ence relation > i such that G ( > i ) = T and any set of objects including x is preferred to those sets excluding x . ( For example , take an additively repre - sentable preference relation ui such that ui ( x ) = 2k , and Jui ( y ) l < 1 for any y ox . ) Therefore , f is strategy - proof implies x cf ( S1 , . . . , , n . . . , 5 ) when x E Ti . ( ii ) Second , if x Ef ( S1 , . . . , Si , . . . , Sn ) and x 4 Si , then x Ef ( S1 , . . . , Ti , . . . . , Sn ) for every Ti . This is because we can find an additive preference relation > i such that G ( > i ) = Si and any set of objects excluding x is preferred to f ( S , . . . , Si . . . . Sn ) which includes x . ( For example , let ui ( x ) = - 2k , and Iui ( y ) I < 1 for any y ox . ) Therefore , f is strategy - proof implies x E f ( S , . . . . TO , . . . Sn ) for every Ti . ( iii ) For any object x , let Wx = { M cNJ there exists an S = ( S1 , S2 , . . . , 5n ) such that M = { ilx c Si } , and x E f ( S ) ) . We show that Cx = ( N , Wx ) is a general - ized committee . Suppose M E Wx . There exists an S = ( S 2 , . . . . Sn ) such that M = { ilx E Si } , and x Ef ( S ) . Then for any M ' D M , construct S ' as follows : Sit = K , for i E M ' \ M ; and Sit = Si , otherwise . When one replaces Si by Sit one by one to go from S to S ' , successive applications of ( i ) and ( ii ) lead to x E f ( S ' ) . So M ' E Wx since M ' = { ilx E S / ! } . This shows that Cx = ( N , Wx ) is a generalized committee . ( iv ) Finally , we have to show that for any x and S = ( SI , S21 , . . Sn ) , X E f ( S ) if and only if Mx = { ilx E St ! } E Wx . The " only if ' part is just the definition of Cx . On the other hand , if Mx E Wx , then there exists an S ' = ( S1 , S , . I . . , S9 ) , x E St ! < / * x E Si , and x E f ( S ' ) . Again , when one replaces Si by Sit one by one to go from S to S ' , successive applications of ( i ) and ( ii ) lead to x Ecf ( S ) . Q . E . D . The limitation of Lemma 1 is that the voting schemes considered are assumed a priori to have the property of " tops only . " The example after Theorem 1 illustrates that " tops only " is not a consequence of strategy - proofness . However , if voter sovereignty is assumed , then we can show that strategy - proofness 602 SALVADOR BARBERA , HUGO SONNENSCHEIN , AND LIN ZHOU implies " tops only . " In fact , even a weaker condition than voter sovereignty suffices . To motivate this condition , let us have a closer look at the structure of voting by generalized committees . An object for which the generalized commit - tee has an empty collection of winning coalitions will never appear in any outcome , while an object for which the generalized committee contains even the empty coalition as a winning coalition will appear in all outcomes . Furthermore , if one examines the class of objects that appear in some outcomes but not all , then any subset of this class , union the set of objects that are always chosen , will occur as an outcome . This property is called weak voter sovereignty . DEFINITION 11 : For a voting scheme f , let Uf = U A e range ( f ) A , and Lf - nAErange ( f ) A . We say that f satisfies weak voter sovereignty if range ( f ) = { Lf U SIS e 2Uf } . We now provide a characterization of voting schemes which are strategy - proof on ( ps ) ' and satisfy weak voter sovereignty without the assumption of " tops only . " LEMMA 2 : A voting scheme f : ( ps ) n - * 2K is strategy - proof on ( pS ) n and satisfies weak voter sovereignty if and only if it is voting by generalized committees . With a voting scheme f that is voting by generalized committees the struc - tures of the generalized committees associated with objects that never come out or always come out are as follows : x 0 U * CX = ( N , Wx ) is empty , and x E Lf - C = ( N , Wx ) contains the empty coalition as a winning coalition . Since voter sovereignty implies weak voter sovereignty , the hypotheses of Theorem 1 imply those of Lemma 2 and together with the fact that voter sovereignty also implies Uf = K , and Lf = 0 the preceding sentence allows one to deduce Theorem 1 from Lemma 2 . 9 Before we can turn to the proof of Lemma 2 , we introduce the concept of option sets as used by Barber ' a and Peleg ( 1990 ) . DEFINITION 12 : For a voting scheme f , the set of options , given > i E PS , is defined by ( rf i ( > i ) = { AE 2K1 3 > - i E ( PS ) fn ' such that f ( > i1 > - i ) = A } . Sometimes it is simply written as o - _ i ( > i ) when it is clear which f is being discussed . PROOF OF LEMMA 2 : It is easy to check that voting by generalized committees is strategy - proof on ( pS ) n and satisfies weak voter sovereignty . To prove the converse , we proceed by induction . 9 Lemma 2 contains little of substance beyond Theorem 1 . However , the proof we have adopted proceeds by induction on the number of voters and the weaker hypotheses of Lemma 2 are better adapted to this induction . VOTING BY COMMITTEES 603 Step 1 : We begin with the case in which there are two voters . The following facts are direct consequences of the assumption that f is strategy - proof and satisfies voter sovereignty . Fact 1 : For all > 1 , > 2 E PS , f ( > l , > 2 ) = argmax ( > l , ffl ( > 2 ) ) = argmax ( > 2 , ( B2 ( > l ) ) - Fact 2 : For all > E pS , f ( > , > ) = argmax ( > , Uf ) . ( i ) We first show : If xEB ( > i ) fnUf , and x AEo - 2 ( > 1 ) , then AU { x } E 02 ( > i ) . Assume this is not true . Find a preference relation > 2 in ps such that A U { x } > 2A > 2D for any other D . ( For example , choose an additive one with u2 ( y ) > 2 for all y cA , U2 ( X ) = 1 , and u2 ( z ) < - 1 otherwise . ) Fact 1 thus implies f ( > 1 , > 2 ) = A . Since both { x } and A are contained in Uf , so is A U { x } because f satisfies weak voter sovereignty . Therefore , Fact 2 implies f ( > 2 , > 2 ) = A U { x } . But given A U { x } > 1A , voter 1 then can manipulate at ( > , , > 2 ) via > 2 . This is a contradiction . ( ii ) Second , if x e B ( > , ) U Lf , and xE A E o - 2 ( > l ) , then A \ f { x } c E - 2 ( > l ) * Assume this is not true . Find a preference relation > 2 in ps such that A \ { x } > 2A > 2D for any other D . ( For example , let u2 ( y ) > 2 for all ycEA , u2 ( x ) = - 1 , and u2 ( z ) < - 1 otherwise . ) Fact 1 thus implies f ( > 1 , > 2 ) = A . And Fact 2 implies f ( > 2 , > 2 ) = A \ { x } . Since A \ { x } > 1A , voter 1 then can manipulate at ( > 1 , > 2 ) via > 2 . Again a contradiction . ( iii ) Third , if B ( > 1 ) = B ( > ' ) , then o2 ( > 1 ) = U2 ( > ' ) . Suppose this is not true . There would exist a set A E u2 ( > 1 ) such that A e u2 ( > 1 ' ) . Decompose A into two disjoint sets : A = E1 uF1 , such that E1 cB ( > 1 ) , and F1 cBc ( > 1 ) . Let > in ps be such that B ( > ) = A . Fact 1 implies f ( > 1 , > ) = A . Now consider f ( > 1 ' , > ) = D A , since A e u2 ( > ' ) . Also decompose D into two disjoint sets : D = E2UF2 , such that E2 cB ( > 1 ' ) = B ( > 1 ) , and F2 c Bc ( > 1 ' ) = Bc ( > 1 ) - It must be true that E1 c E2 . If not , let x E E1 but x e E2 . Since x E E1 = A n B > 1 ) , x e B ( > 1 ) = B ( > 1 ' ) , and x e A = B ( > ) . Hence { x } U D E o - 2 ( > 1 ' ) by ( i ) , and { x } U D > D . Then f ( > 1 ' , > ) = D contradicts Fact 1 . A similar reasoning , using ( ii ) , leads to F2 c F1 . Therefore , F * E implies that at least one of the two inclusions E1 c E2 and F2 c F1 is strict . But this means f ( > 1 ' , > ) = D = E2 U F2 > 1El U F1 = A = f ( > 1 , > ) . Voter 1 then can manipulate at ( > 1 , > ) via > 1 ' . ( iv ) Now we show that f depends on the top sets of voter ' s preferences only . Assume B ( > 1 ) = B ( > 1 ' ) and B ( > 2 ) = B ( > 2 ) , for some > 1 , > l ' , > 2 , and > 2 ' C ps . Since U2 ( > 1 ) = a2 ( > 1 ) by ( iii ) , Fact 1 implies f ( > 1 , > 2 ) = f ( > 1 ' > 2 ) . Notice that identical statements of ( i ) , ( ii ) , and ( iii ) still hold if the roles of the agents are reversed . So we also have f ( > l ' , > 2 ) = f ( > l ' > 2 ' ) . Therefore , f ( > l , > 2 ) = f ( > ' , > 2 ) . 604 SALVADOR BARBERA , HUGO SONNENSCHEIN , AND LIN ZHOU ( v ) Given ( iv ) , we can apply Lemma 1 to conclude that f is voting by generalized committees . And the structures of these generalized committees are obvious . Step 2 : We assume that the theorem is true for all cases with less than n voters . Now we consider a voting scheme f from ( pS ) n to 2K that satisfies the assumptions of the theorem . ( i ) When we fix voter l ' s preference relation at > 1 , we get a voting scheme f > 1 from ( pS ) n - 1 to 2K that is induced by f : f > ( > 21 . . * > n ) f ( > 1 , > 2 X - * * - > n ) X It is obvious that f > 1 is strategy - proof . In addition , there are two sets D ( > , ) and I ( > 1 ) such that range ( f > 1 ) = { D ( > 1 ) USISE2I ( > ' ) } , and these two sets depend on B ( > , ) only . We will have a proof of this statement in ( ii ) . For now let us assume it is true . Therefore , f > 1 also satisfies weak voter sovereignty . Then by the induction hypothesis , f > 1 is voting by generalized committees . Now for any > 1 E ps , we have a voting scheme f > 1 that is voting by generalized committees . Furthermore , f > 1 f > 1 ' whenever B ( > 1 ) = B ( > 1 ' ) . Suppose this is not true . Then , without loss of generality , there would exist an object xc I ( > 1 ) and a coalition M such that M is winning in C > 1 = ( N \ { 1 } , Wx ) but not winning in Cx > 1 ' = ( N \ { 1 } , Wx ' ) . Consider a preference profile ( > 21 . > n ) in which B ( > i ) = { x } if i EM , and B ( > j ) = 0 otherwise . So f > I ( > 2 , . . . . , > n ) = { X } U D ( > 1 ) and f > 1 ' ( > 2 , . . . . > n ) = D ( > 1 ' ) = D ( > 1 ) . But then f is manipulable by voter 1 ( either at ( > 1 , > 21 . . . > n ) or at ( > 1 ' , > 2 1 > n ) , depending on whether x is good or bad for > 1 , and > 1 ' ) . This is a contradiction . To summarize , we have shown that f > 1 is voting by generalized committees for any > 1 E ps , thus depends on the voters ' most preferred sets only and that f > 1 f > 1 ' whenever B ( > 1 ) = B ( > i ' ) . Therefore , f must depend on the voters ' most preferred sets only . Hence we can now apply Lemma 1 to conclude that f is voting by generalized committees . ( ii ) Here we prove the statement made in ( i ) : For any > 1 E ps , there are two sets D ( > 1 ) and If > 1 ) such that range ( f > 1 ) = { D ( > 1 ) U S IS E 2 ( > ' 1 ) } , and these two sets depend on B ( > , ) only . We will use an important property that any strategy - proof scheme F possesses : Fact 3 : For all > , F ( > , > , . . . , > ) = argmax ( > , range ( F ) ) . We construct a voting scheme f from ( pS ) 2 to 2K as follows : A ( > l1x > 2 ) = A ( > 1x > 2 1 . . . > 2 ) We first show that a2A ( > 1 ) = oaf1 ( > 1 ) for any > 1 . It is trivial that o2f ( > 1 ) C Jf 1 ( > 1 ) . On the other hand , for any A Eo - f 1 ( > 1 ) , we find some > 2 E pS such that B ( > 2 ) = A . Since f > 1 is strategy - proof , we can apply Fact 3 to f > 1 to get : f ( > 1 , > 2 ) = f ( > 1 , > 2 X * * > 2 ) = f > 1 ( > 2X . . . . X > 2 ) = argmax ( > 2 , fj1 ( > 1 ) ) = A . This shows o - f 1 ( > 1 ) C ( Jf ( > 1 ) . So , ( Jf ( > 1 ) = o - f1 ( > 1 ) VOTING BY COMMITTEES 605 A We now claim that f is also strategy - proof and satisfies weak voter sovereignty . It is obvious that voter 1 in f cannot manipulate . And since a - f ( > 1 ) = o - f 1 ( > 1 ) Fact 3 leadsA to f ( > 1 , > 2 ) = f ( > 11 > 2 , . . . , > 2 ) = argmax ( > 2 , o - 1 ( > 1 ) ) = argmax ( > 2 , 2of ( > ) ) . So voter 2 in f cannot manipulate either . Hence f is strategy - proof . Because range ( f ) U o - f ( > ) and range ( f ) = U f ( > 1 ) , o - f ( > , ) = of 1 ( > 1 ) for all > l ' s leads to range ( f ) = range ( f ) . Therefore , f satisfies weak voter sovereignty since f does . By step 1 , we know that f > 1 is voting by generalized committees . Then it is obvious that for any > 1 E ps , there are two sets D ( > , ) and I ( > , ) such that o - f ( > 1 ) = { D ( > 1 ) U SISEc 2 ' ( > ' ) } , and these two sets depend on B ( > 1 ) only . So our statement is proved since o - { ( > , ) = - f 1 ( > 1 ) = range ( f ' ) - Q . E . D . It is now easy to complete the proofs of the other results . Corollary 1 follows immediately from Theorem 1 . If a voting scheme f is strategy - proof on separable preferences and satisfies voter sovereignty , then it is voting by committees by Theorem 1 . The additional requirement of neutrality implies that the committee structures for all objects must be the same , and the requirement of anonymity implies that all minimal winning coalitions must have the same size Q . Therefore , f is voting by quota Q . To prove Theorem 2 and Corollary 2 , one needs to observe that in our proofs of Lemma 1 and Lemma 2 all preference relations we have used are in fact additively representable . Hence , the exact same proof applies to Theorem 2 and Corollary 2 . 3 . SEPARABLE PREFERENCES AND THE STRATEGY - PROOFNESS OF VOTING BY COMMITTEES We already know that voting by committees is the only method that satisfies strategy - proofness and voter sovereignty on the domain of separable prefer - ences . In this section we will show that , in general , voting by committees cannot be strategy - proof on any larger domain . To make this idea precise , we restrict attention to admissible domains that admit a wide enough variety of prefer - ences . DEFINITION 13 : A domain R = R1 x R2 X . . . x R _ C pn is rich if , for all i E N and all A c K , there exist > i E Ri , such that A = B ( > i ) . If voting by committees is strategy - proof on a rich domain R , then what does this tell about the structure of R ? Not much can be deduced if the power structures of the committees are extreme . Consider the example of voting by a single committee C . When C is dictatorial , voting by committee C is strategy - proof on the universal domain , and there is no restriction at all on the admissible preferences . Dictatorship is an example of one of the cases we consider extreme : some voter can single - handedly prevent other voters from forming a winning coalition . The other extreme is when some voter never contributes to any winning coalition : for any winning coalition he belongs to , some voters within it - excluding him - can form a winning coalition on their own . We now present a condition that is used to eliminate such situations . 606 SALVADOR BARBERA , HUGO SONNENSCHEIN , AND LIN ZHOU DEFINITION 14 : Assume that we have a committee C = ( N , W ) with minimal winning coalitions Na ' s . A voter i is a vetoer if i E fl NaNf . A voter i is a dummy if i e Ua Na A committee C = ( N , W ) is nonextreme if it contains neither veto voters nor dummy voters . THEOREM 3 : Assume that voting scheme f is voting by nonextreme committees . 1ff is strategy - proof on a rich domain R = R , XR2X . . . XR , thenRicPsfor all i . ' 0 PROOF : We start with an equivalent specification of Ps : A preference rela - tion > is separable on K if and only if , ( * * ) for all x and all A cK ( x eA ) , A U { x } > A if and only if xE B ( > ) . The necessity of ( * * ) is obvious . On the other hand , suppose ( * * ) holds for some > . If we let A = 0 in ( * * ) , then ( * * ) says { x } > 0 if and only x EB ( > ) . Hence B ( > ) = G ( > ) . But ( * * ) is then simply the definition of separability when B ( > ) is replaced by G ( > ) . So > is separable on K . Now we show that Ri C Ps for all i . Given a preference > j C Ri , take any x , and A such that x OA . ( i ) Suppose x e B ( > j ) . Since C , is nonextreme , there is a minimal winning coalition N , in C , such that i E Nl . Again since Cx is nonextreme , N \ { i } is winning in Cx . Because R is rich , we can choose > j for j E N \ { a } such that B ( > j ) = A U { x } , j E N , \ { i } , B ( > J ) = A , otherwise . With preferences defined this way , f [ B ( > ) . . . B ( > ) , . . . , B ( > n ) ] = A u { x } . But if voter i announces E = B ( > d ) \ { x } , f [ B ( > , ) , . . I E , . . . , B ( > n ) ] I = A . f is strategy - proof implies A u { x } > jA . ( ii ) Suppose x - B ( > i ) . By the same method , we can show that f is strategy - proof implies A > iA u { x } . Hence by the specification of Ps provided above , > i E Ps . Q . E . D . 4 . EFFICIENCY AND STRATEGY - PROOFNESS ON RESTRICTED DOMAINS11 We now apply Theorem 1 to demonstrate that , in general , there exists no efficient , strategy - proof and nondictatorial voting scheme on ( pS ) n . The point here is that the constraints associated with incentive compatibility prevent one from achieving the Pareto frontier even on this restricted domain . 10A more general result accommodating extreme committees is available . But such a treatment will blur the main picture without providing more insights . 11 This section was motivated by discussions with L . Corchon and A . Postlewaite , who pointed out to us that voting by quota is not Pareto optimal . VOTING BY COMMITrEES 607 DEFINITION 15 : A voting scheme f is efficient if for all ( > , , > 21 . . . I > n ) in its domain , the outcome is Pareto optimal , i . e . , for all A cK , A sf ( > 1 , > 2 . . . , > n ) , f ( > l , > 2 , . , > n ) > iA for at least one i . DEFINITION 16 : A voting scheme f is dictatorial if there exists a voter i such that f ( > l , > 2 , . . . , > n ) = argmax ( > i , 2K ) for all ( > 1 , > 2 , . . . , > n ) in its domain . THEOREM 4 : For k > 3 , there exists no efficient , strategy - proof , and nondicta - torial voting scheme on ( p s . Efficiency obviously implies voter sovereignty ; therefore , by Theorem 1 , any voting scheme that is efficient and strategy - proof must be voting by committees . Furthermore , we can show that voting by committees 1s generally not efficient unless it is dictatorial . As an introductory example , we consider a situation where K = { x , y } , N = { 1 , 2 } , and the voting scheme is voting by quota Q = 1 . Voter 1 prefers x to the empty set , but dislikes y so much that even x and y together are worse than the empty set ; and voter 2 prefers y to the empty set , but dislikes x so much that x and y together are also worse than the empty set . Voting by quota Q = 1 produces the outcome { xy } , which is Pareto dominated by 0 . The second example is : K = { x , y ) , N = { 1 , 2 , 3 } , and the voting scheme is voting by quota Q = 2 . In this case the voting scheme turns out to be efficient . However , the second example represents a rare case . It occurs only when k = 2 and the committees in the voting schemes have some special structures . 12 The negative result prevails when k > 3 . PROOF OF THEOREM 4 : We will provide a proof for the case in which K contains three distinct objects only : x , y , and z . The proof for the general case is similar . We show that the existence of such a voting scheme leads to a contradiction . Suppose f is a voting scheme that is efficient , strategy - proof , and nondictato - rial on ( pS ) n . By Theorem 1 , we know that f must be voting by committees . Let Cx , Cy , and CZ be the corresponding committees for x , y , and z . For any nonempty partition of voters , N = N , u N2 ( N , n N2 = 0 ) : ( i ) If N , is winning for one object , say x , then N2 cannot be winning for another object , say y . Otherwise , let > , and > 2 in P ' be the following : { x } > 10 > 1 { xy } > 1 { y } > . . . , and { Y } > 20 > 2 { XY } > 2 { X } > 2 . . . . ( For example , take two additively representable preference relations ul and u2 such that u1 ( x ) = 1 , u , ( y ) = - 2 , u , ( z ) = - 3 , and u ( 0 ) = 0 ; and u2 ( x ) = 2 , u2 ( y ) = - 1 , u2 ( z ) = - 3 , and u2 ( 0 ) = 0 . ) For the preference profile in which every voter in N , has > , and everyone in N2 has > 2 , f produces the outcome { xy } , which is Pareto dominated by 0 . 12An earlier version of our paper ( Barber ' a , Sonnenschein , and Zhou ( 1988 ) ) contained a more detailed discussion on this point . 608 SALVADOR BARBERA , HUGO SONNENSCHEIN , AND LIN ZHOU ( ii ) If N1 is not winning for one object , say x , then N2 must be winning for any other object , say y . Otherwise , let > 1 and > 2 in ps be the following : { x } > 1 { xy } > 10 > 1 { y } > 1 . , and { YI > 2 { XYI > 20 > 2 { x } > 2 . . . . For the preference profile in which every voter in N1 has > 1 and everyone in N2 has > 21 f produces the outcome 0 , which is Pareto dominated by { xy } . Similarly , if N = N1 U N2 U N3 ( Ni ' s are exclusive ) , then : ( iii ) It cannot be true that N1 is not winning for x , N2 not winning for y , and N3 not winning for z . We now define rx = min { # MIM is winning in CXj . ry and rz are defined similarly . Finally , let r = min { rx , ry , rz } . ( 1 ) Suppose r = 1 . Without loss of generality , we assume that voter 1 is winning for x . According to ( i ) , N \ { 1 } is not winning for y or z . Then , according to ( ii ) , voter 1 is winning for both z and y . Again , according to ( i ) , N \ { 1 } is not winning for x . But now voter 1 is a dictator . This is a contradiction . ( 2 ) Suppose 2 < r < n . Assume M is winning for x and # M = r . According to ( i ) , N \ M cannot be winning for z . Since # M = r > 2 , we can divide M into two disjoint nonempty coalitions : M = M1 U M2 . By the definition of r , M1 is not winning for x and M2 not winning for y . Together with the fact that N \ M is not winning for z , we have a contradiction to ( iii ) . ( 3 ) Suppose r = n . Simply divide N into two disjoint nonempty coalitions : N = N1 UN2 . By the definition of r , N1 is not winning for x and N2 not winning for y . This contradicts ( ii ) . Q . E . D .
