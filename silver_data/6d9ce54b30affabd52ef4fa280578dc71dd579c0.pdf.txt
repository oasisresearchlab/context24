Epsins function as adaptors by recognizing ubiquitinated cargo and as endocytic acces - sory proteins by contributing to endocytic network stabil - ity / regulation and membrane bending . Importantly , epsins play a critical role in signaling by contributing to epider - mal growth factor receptor downregulation and the acti - vation of notch and RhoGTPase pathways . In this review , we present an overview of the epsins and emphasize their functional importance as coordinators of endocytosis and signaling . Keywords : endocytosis ; epsin ; notch ; RhoGTPase ; signaling . Introduction Endocytosis is the process by which cells internalize portions of the plasma membrane to uptake nutrients and to control their membrane composition and surface area . In addition to cellular homeostasis , this fundamental cellular process is crucial for the regulation of multiple signaling pathways . It is well - known that endocytosis attenuates signals by inter - nalizing activated ligand - receptor complexes from the cell surface . However , a growing body of evidence demonstrates that endocytosis also activates signaling , for example , by con - tributing to the assembly of signaling endosomes from which new signaling events can be generated . This review dis - cusses the epsin family of endocytic proteins and their role in coordinating endocytosis and signaling . For a more detailed chronological perspective and discussion of topics , such as epsin regulation , we refer the reader to an excellent review by Beverly Wendland ( 1 ) . The epsins Brief overview of the epsin protein family The epsins are a family of endocytic adaptor proteins con - served across evolution with crucial physiological roles . Thus , while in metazoans epsins are required for proper embryo development ( 2 – 5 ) , in yeast , they are essential for cell viability ( 6 – 8 ) . The founding member of the family , rat epsin - 1 ( Eps15 interacting protein 1 ) was discovered by the DeCamilli lab ( Yale University ) as an interaction part - ner of the endocytic accessory protein Eps15 ( 9 ) . Sequence analysis of epsin - 1 revealed striking similarities with the mitotic phosphoprotein - 90 from Xenopus laevis ( 10 ) and two Saccharomyces cerevisae proteins later identiﬁ ed as epsin homologs ( 6 ) . Soon after , a second paralog , epsin - 2 was discovered ( 11 ) . Both , epsin - 1 and - 2 were characterized as plasma membrane - localized components of the clathrin - mediated endocytic machinery ( 9 , 11 ) . Although ubiqui - tously expressed , epsin - 1 and - 2 were found to be enriched in the brain ( 9 , 11 ) . In contrast , a third epsin paralog , epsin - 3 , was subsequently shown to have a very restricted expression proﬁ le that includes migrating keratinocytes ( 12 ) , gastric parietal cells ( 13 ) , and several carcinomas ( 12 – 15 ) . Saccharomyces cerevisiae and most vertebrates ( includ - ing primates , rodents , and zebraﬁ sh ) contain at least two epsin paralogs . In contrast , only one epsin gene is present in Schizosaccharomyces pombe , Caenorhabditis elegans , and Drosophila melanogaster . However , the single epsin gene in D . melanogaster produces two alternatively spliced forms ( 3 , 16 ) . In addition to these classical plasma membrane - localized epsins , there is a ubiquitous family of epsin - like proteins that display partial sequence similarities but possess several dis - tinctive features . Speciﬁ cally , these epsin - related ( epsinR ) proteins ( also known as enthoprotin , clint , or epsin - 4 ) have a different set of protein and lipid interaction partners , local - ize to the trans - golgi network / endosomes and participate in endosome to golgi transport ( 17 – 21 ) . Therefore , a detailed description of this protein subfamily is beyond the scope of this review . Domain organization of epsins Domain organization of the epsins will be described from N - to C - terminus taking a generic mammalian epsin as a model ( Figure 1 ) . At the N - terminus , epsins bear a highly conserved , approximately 150 amino acid - long epsin 118 A . Sen et al . N - terminal homology ( ENTH ) domain ( 22 ) [ reviewed in ( 23 ) ] . The structure of the mammalian ENTH domain has been solved by X - ray crystallography as well as by NMR spectroscopy ( 24 – 27 ) , and the emerging structural con - sensus revealed a superhelical fold comprised of seven α helices followed by an eighth helix misaligned with the superhelical axis . Structurally , the ENTH domain is most similar to the VHS domain characteristic of the Vps27 , Hrs , and STAM trafﬁ cking proteins , and it also contains arma - dillo and HEAT repeat segments found in β - catenin and karyopherin - β , respectively ( 24 ) . The ENTH domain binds phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate , a lipid enriched at different regions within the plasma membrane including endocytic sites ( 25 , 27 , 28 ) [ reviewed in ( 29 ) ] . Importantly , an elegant study from the McMahon lab demonstrated that this interaction triggers a dramatic conformational change that induces the formation of an additional N - terminal alpha - helix , helix0 ( α 0 ) ( 27 ) . Owing to its amphipathic nature , α 0 inserts into the cytoplasmic leaﬂ et of the plasma membrane and promotes membrane curvature ( 27 , 28 , 30 – 32 ) . This remarkable process is believed to be one of the initial steps of membrane invagination toward the formation of clathrin - coated pits ( CCPs ) and eventually of clathrin - coated vesi - cles [ reviewed in ( 33 – 36 ) ] . Following the discovery of ubiquitin interacting motifs ( UIM ) in a subunit of the 26S proteasome ( 37 ) , the consen - sus UIM sequence was identiﬁ ed in several proteins involved in receptor - mediated endocytosis , including epsin ( 38 ) . Most epsins contain two or three UIM copies that interact with ubiquitinated cargo and are located C - terminal to the ENTH domain ( 39 – 41 ) [ reviewed in ( 1 ) ] . Importantly , coop - erative binding of the UIMs is required for high avidity and Figure 1 Schematic representation of a generic mammalian epsin .

Furthermore , it has been proposed that multiple monoubiquitination or limited polyubiquitination ( up to approximately four ubiquitin units ) of cargo is essential for achieving sufﬁ cient interaction avidity for epsin recruit - ment ( 42 – 45 ) [ reviewed in ( 46 ) ] . The region between the UIMs and the very C - terminus of epsin is mostly unstructured ( 47 ) and displays high interspe - cies sequence divergence . However , this region also includes several conserved short signature motifs for binding vari - ous components of the endocytic machinery ( corresponding to 5 – 13 % of this region ’ s sequence ) . Speciﬁ cally , mam - malian epsins possess two clathrin - binding motifs ( CBM ) that closely follow the consensus L ø Z ø Z motif ( where L is leucine , ø and Z are amino acids with bulky hydrophobic and polar side chains , respectively ) and bind to the termi - nal domain of clathrin heavy chain ( 48 , 49 ) [ reviewed in ( 50 ) ] . These clathrin - binding sequences ﬂ ank a cluster of three to eight DP [ W / F ] ( aspartate - proline - tryptophan / phe - nylalanine ) repeats that bind to the adaptor complex AP2 ( 9 , 51 – 54 ) . In fact , the resulting avidity of these AP2 - binding motifs is so high that overexpression of an epsin - 1 fragment containing its DP [ W / F ] motifs leads to severe impairment of AP2 - mediated internalization by a dominant - negative mechanism ( 9 ) . C - terminal to the CBM - DPW cassette , two or three NPF ( asparagine - proline - phenylalanine ) tripeptide repeats are found . These motifs are recognized by the eps15 - homology ( EH ) domain of proteins like eps15 , intersectin , and POB1 ( 9 , 55 , 56 ) . This general architecture ( Figure 1 ) is mostly preserved in higher eukaryotes with minor variations in the number of some binding motifs . In contrast , yeast epsins display sig - niﬁ cant differences . For example , the AP2 - binding DP [ W / F ] motifs are absent , and a single clathrin - binding domain is present at their very C - terminus ( 6 ) ( see Figure 2 ) . Other deviations from this general architecture are present in the epsin ortholog of Dictyostelium discoideum . This epsin lacks UIMs but interacts with clathrin and AP2 at the plasma mem - brane ( 57 ) ( Figure 2 ) . In Trypanosoma bruceii , the single ENTH domain - containing protein , TbEpsinR , displays fea - tures common to both epsin and epsinR . Similar to epsinR , TbEpsinR lacks UIMs , and a fraction is partially localized at endosomal membranes ; however , unlike epsinR , a second population contributes to clathrin - dependent endocytosis at the plasma membrane ( 58 ) . Epsin and endocytosis Epsins are proteins capable of fulﬁ lling different roles at nascent endocytic sites . On one hand , as these proteins bear UIMs , they act as endocytic adaptors by directly binding to ubiquitinated cargo . On the other hand , epsins also interact with other elements of the endocytic machinery including the hubs of the endocytic network , i . e . , AP2 and clathrin . Therefore , epsins function as an accessory protein by consoli - dating and regulating the endocytic network . Epsins in endocytosis and signaling 119 Epsin - speciﬁ c cargoes Although yeast epsins are known to participate in the internal - ization of several membrane proteins , such as the alpha - factor receptor Ste2 ( 40 , 59 ) , they are not essential for their endo - cytosis , i . e . , to date , no physiological cargo has been found to be epsin speciﬁ c . In higher eukaryotes , epsin is required for endocytosis of notch ligands ( 4 , 60 – 62 ) , and a body of evidence strongly implicates this adaptor in epidermal growth factor receptor ( 63 – 66 ) and epithelial sodium channel ( 67 – 69 ) internalization . Notch ligands The notch signaling pathway is a conserved signaling module involved in cell fate determination [ reviewed in ( 70 ) ] . While genetic evidence obtained in D . melanogaster suggests that endocytosis is required in both signal - sending and - receiving cells for notch activation ( 71 ) , other studies indicated that Drosophila epsin , liquid facets ( Lqf ) is only required in the signal - sending cell ( 60 , 61 ) . These observations imply that epsin contributes to notch activation by regulating / facilitating the endocytosis of the notch ligands delta / serrate / lag2 ( DSL ) ( 4 , 60 – 62 ) . Introduction of a tyrosine - based internalization signal ( from the LDL receptor ) in the cytoplasmic domain of delta ( Dl ) could bypass the need for epsin in notch signaling ( 61 ) , supporting the notion that the endocytic adaptor function of epsin is critical for this pathway activation . Moreover , the endocytosis and signaling of Dl was found to be epsin speciﬁ c , as disruption of AP2 had no signiﬁ cant impact ( 72 ) . Dl and serrate accumulate at the plasma membrane in cells deﬁ cient in mindbomb or neuralized , suggesting that these E3 ligases ubiquitinate DSL ligands for epsin - mediated internalization ( 61 , 62 , 73 – 77 ) . Although the exact mechanism by which epsin - mediated endocytosis triggers notch activation is not fully understood , it is clear that it requires ubiquitination , epsin binding , and internalization of notch ligands . Details on the signaling relevance of epsins for this pathway are described in the section on ‘ Epsin controls notch signaling activation via endocytosis ’ . Epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) This receptor tyrosine kinase belongs to the erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog ( ErbB ) family consisting of four closely related members : ErbB1 ( EGFR ) , ErbB2 , ErbB3 , and ErbB4 ( also designated as HER1 - 4 for human epidermal growth factor receptor ) . This protein family , particularly ErbB1 , has been the focus of extensive research due to its role in cancer . Indeed , EGFR expression is frequently upregulated in many solid tumors where it promotes cancer progression [ recently reviewed in ( 78 ) ] , thus making the use of EGFR inhibitors a powerful therapeutic approach . Importantly , deﬁ cient internalization of EGFR also leads to receptor hypersignaling and , in consequence , to malignant transformation ( 79 , 80 ) [ reviewed in ( 81 ) ] . Therefore , the study of EGFR endocytosis has captured considerable interest . Classically , binding of ligands to the extracellular domain of their receptors not only induces downstream signal transduction but also promotes receptor endocytosis [ reviewed in ( 82 , 83 ) ] . The ubiquitin - ligase Cbl is believed to initiate the internalization of EGFR ( 63 ) by promoting mono , multi - , and polyubiquitination ( 63 , 66 , 84 ) . However , whether ubiquitination is necessary and sufﬁ cient for internalization still remains to be fully established [ reviewed in ( 85 ) ] . Although there is some result variability , likely associated with knock - down efﬁ ciency and diversity of cell lines used , it is broadly accepted that internalization of ubiquitinated - EGFR is dependent on epsin and requires the integrity of its UIMs ( 43 , 64 – 66 ) . Whether this process is clathrin depen - dent or not has been a topic of debate . On one hand , it has been proposed that upon exposure to high ( but still physio - logical ) concentrations of ligand , EGFR undergoes extensive ubiquitination ( 64 ) . Under these conditions , in addition to the classical clathrin - dependent internalization mechanism , a clathrin - independent , caveolae - , Eps15 - , and epsin - dependent internalization route has been reported to occur for EGFR endocytosis ( 64 ) . Interestingly , another report indicated that epsin binding to ubiquitin negatively affected its inter - action with clathrin ( 86 ) . Further , it was proposed that the Figure 2 Comparison of domain architecture of epsins from different organisms . Hs , Homo sapiens ( NP _ 037465 . 2 ) ; Sc , S . cerevisiae ( NP _ 010120 ) ; Dm , D . melanogaster ( AAF05113 ) ; Ce , C . elegans ( NP _ 510459 ) ; Dd , D . discoideum ( XP _ 635269 ) . 120 A . Sen et al . clathrin - independent pathway of EGFR internalization leads to degradation of cargo ( i . e . , to signaling termina - tion ) , whereas the clathrin - dependent route promotes per - sistent signaling as well as recycling of EGFR ( 64 , 87 ) . In contrast , other studies have indicated that epsins are able to interact with both clathrin and ubiquitin simultaneously ( 43 , 63 , 65 , 66 ) and that EGFR does not signiﬁ cantly colocalize with caveolar structures ( 88 ) . These seemingly contradic - tory results likely suggest that EGFR endocytosis is a more complex process than anticipated . In fact , other posttrans - lational modiﬁ cations besides ubiquitination have recently been found to contribute to EGFR uptake ( 84 ) , raising the possibility of multiple endocytic routes and additional adap - tors besides epsin ( yet to be identiﬁ ed ) being involved in the process . Epithelial sodium ( Na ) channel ( ENaC ) This amiloride - sensitive sodium channel is primarily found in polarized epithelia in lung , kidney , colon , sweat ducts , and salivary glands . ENaC is a heteromer composed of two alpha , one beta , and one gamma subunit . This channel functions to maintain electrolyte balance and ﬂ uid movement across the epithelia [ reviewed in ( 89 ) ] . It is known that the ubiquitin - ligase neural precursor cell expressed , developmentally downregulated protein 4 - 2 ( Nedd4 - 2 ) ubiquitinates and promotes ENaC internalization ( 90 – 93 ) . In Liddle ’ s syndrome where ENaC recognition by Nedd4 - 2 is affected , the channel activity is increased resulting in hypertension ( 94 , 95 ) . ENaC was found in clathrin - coated vesicles along with epsin , and these proteins efﬁ ciently co - immunoprecipi - tated together in an epsin UIM - dependent manner ( 68 ) . Furthermore , coexpression of ENaC with Nedd4 - 2 or epsin decreased ENaC - dependent currents , in contrast to a domi - nant - negative dynamin mutant , which increased such currents ( 67 ) . This evidence implicates epsin in the downregula - tion of this sodium channel . Interestingly , the same authors reported that epsin was not implicated in the endocytosis of the K + channel ( 68 ) , renal outer medullary potassium chan - nel ( ROMK ) , even when it is also known to be subjected to ubiquitination ( 96 ) . In addition to the abovementioned cargoes , endocyto - sis of a number of other proteins seems to be dependent on epsins . For example , epsins play a role in the uptake of inﬂ uenza virus bound to its receptor in mammalian cells ( 97 ) . Epsin is also important for the clathrin - mediated inter - nalization of the antigen - presenting MHC class I molecules following ubiquitination by a Kaposi ’ s sarcoma - associated herpesvirus ubiquitin ligase ( 45 , 98 ) . Furthermore , epsin is involved in the internalization of insulin receptor ( 42 ) , and a large - scale RNA interference study revealed that epsin contributes to the internalization of dopamine transporter in neurons ( 99 ) . Additionally , epsin was shown to medi - ate the internalization of ubiquitinated G protein - coupled receptor protease activated receptor 1 ( PAR1 ) ( 100 ) . The Drosophila epsin homolog Lqf was reported to be required for the receptor - mediated endocytosis of Drosophila larval serum proteins into larval fat body cells from the hemo - lymph ( 101 ) . Epsin as an accessory protein Besides its role in the internalization of ubiquitinated cargo , epsins are believed to participate in the stabilization of the endocytic network . An interesting study from the Schmid lab - oratory ( Scripps Institute ) demonstrated that CCPs undergo maturation into functional clathrin - coated vesicles only if they successfully pass through an ‘ endocytic checkpoint ’ ( 102 ) . The checkpoint veriﬁ es , via protein - protein interac - tions , a critical mass of cargo , endocytic components , and other factors ( 102 ) . Failure to reach this critical mass leads to destabilization of the immature CCPs , which subsequently abort ( 102 ) . This observation is in agreement with a previ - ous study that demonstrated that stochastically initiated CCPs undergo rapid collapse if conditions for stabilization are not met ( 103 ) . Epsin - 1 , along with CALM and SNX9 , contrib - utes to this endocytic checkpoint , and even a partial depletion of epsin - 1 ( by 40 % ) leads to an increase in the proportion of abortive CCPs ( 104 ) . Epsins in yeast are also recruited during the early stages of clathrin coat formation ( 105 ) and participate in the assembly of clathrin - coated areas ( 106 ) . Furthermore , the yeast epsins play a similar role in expand - ing and sustaining the endocytic network via protein - protein interactions mediated by their UIM and NPF motifs ( 59 , 107 ) . In addition , epsins might be involved in other regulatory mechanisms affecting the endocytic network , for example , in Dictyostelium , epsin has been implicated in facilitating phos - phorylation of the actin - binding adaptor protein huntingtin - interacting protein 1 related ( Hip1r ) ( 108 , 109 ) . Epsin and signaling The process of endocytosis plays a dual role in signaling regulation . It not only desensitizes cells by downregulating activated receptors ( e . g . , EGFR ) but is also required for the activation of other signaling pathways ( e . g . , via internaliza - tion of notch ligands ) . Importantly , epsins are functional in both the modes of signaling regulation . The role of epsins in signal termination is directly linked to their ability to sup - port endocytosis of receptors ( as described in the ‘ Epsin and endocytosis ’ section ) targeted for lysosomal degradation . The function of epsins in signaling activation has been linked to the notch developmental pathway and RhoGTPase signaling . Epsin controls notch signaling activation via endocytosis Endocytosis is critical for the activation of the notch signal - ing pathway . It has been established that Lqf is essential for proper signaling by the DSL ligands ( 60 , 61 ) . lqf - clones showed no overall disruption of global endocytosis , but Dl was unable to signal to receiving cells ( 61 ) . In agreement , epsins ’ relevance for embryogenesis and development has been clearly demonstrated : Lqf null mutation is embry - onic lethal ( 2 ) , and ﬂ ies overexpressing epsin or expressing mutant epsin alleles display severe eye , wing , and leg mor - phology defects ( 3 , 110 ) . Similarly , epsin mutations , in both Epsins in endocytosis and signaling 121 D . melanogaster and C . elegans , led to defects in germline and heart development due to deﬁ ciencies in notch signaling ( 4 ) . A detailed study on the phenotypes of double epsin - 1 / - 2 knockout ( KO ) mice revealed that embryos did not survive beyond E10 . 5 , while single epsin KO pups were healthy ( 5 ) . However , embryonic ﬁ broblasts taken from double epsin KO embryos did not show abnormalities in general clathrin - me - diated endocytosis . The major cause for the lethality of the embryos was the disruption of the extraembryonic structures , defects in cardiovascular development , somitogenesis , and neural tube differentiation of the embryo ( 5 ) . Interestingly , these phenotypes are highly comparable to those produced by impairment of the notch pathway . These studies suggest that although epsin is dispensable for general endocytosis , it may be critical for cargo - speciﬁ c signaling functions . Epsin contributes to RhoGTPase signaling activation Cdc42 is a highly conserved member of the RhoGTPase fam - ily that acts as the master regulator of cell polarity [ reviewed in ( 111 ) ] . This signaling protein was ﬁ rst identiﬁ ed in yeast through mutants that led to a cell division arrest and loss of actin cytoskeleton polarization ( 112 ) . Indeed , Cdc42 regu - lates the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons [ reviewed in ( 111 ) ] and modulates membrane trafﬁ cking [ reviewed in ( 113 ) ] among other functions . Complementary to their endo - cytic role , epsins are involved in the regulation of this key cell polarity protein ( 8 ) . Mechanistically , the epsin ’ s ENTH domain interacts with and sequesters / inhibits yeast Cdc42 GTPase - activating proteins ( Cdc42 GAPs ) ( 8 ) . This interac - tion has been proposed to relieve the GAP - induced Cdc42 inhibition and thereby to promote Cdc42 signaling activation . Interestingly , this function is analogous to the one described for the epsin - interacting protein intersectin that sequesters / inhibits a Cdc42 GAP , CdGAP ( 114 ) , and displays GEF activ - ity toward Cdc42 ( 115 ) . In yeast , the ENTH domain is necessary and sufﬁ cient to sustain cell viability upon epsin deletion ( 6 , 8 ) . Furthermore , the speciﬁ c residues required for this essential function of the ENTH domain were also identiﬁ ed . As expected , ENTH domain mutations in these residues ( ENTH Y100R and ENTH T104D ) led to defects in Cdc42 activation , reduced viabil - ity , and actin cytoskeleton depolarization ( 8 ) . In agreement , in Dictyostelium discoideum , T107 , the residue analogous to the yeast T104 , was essential for normal actin dynamics at the membrane ( 109 ) as well as for the development of nor - mal spore morphology ( 57 ) . Interestingly , yeast epsin Ent2 has also been found to have physical and genetic interactions with the only S . cerevisiae Cdc42 GEF ( 116 , 117 ) . In addition , the ENTH domain of Ent2 bears an additional activity in cell divi - sion signaling pathways ( 118 ) that is dependent on its ability to interact strongly with one of the yeast Cdc42 GAPs : bud emergence 3 ( Bem3 ) . Bem3 is also one of the key players in the assembly of the septin cytoskeleton , a family of scaffolding proteins essential for proper cell division ( 119 , 120 ) . In fact , overexpression of the ENTH domain of Ent2 , but not of Ent1 , induces severe abnormalities in septin organization ( 118 ) . Taken together , this evidence indicates that the endocytic protein epsin is involved in Cdc42 regulation , probably coor - dinating the processes of establishment of cell polarity and endocytosis in time and space . Importantly , epsin involvement in Rho GTPase signaling function is conserved in mammals . Speciﬁ cally , epsins via their ENTH domain were found to interact with the Cdc42 / Rac1 GAP and Ral effector , Ral - binding protein 1 ( RalBP1 ) ( 121 ) . Indeed , siRNA - mediated knockdown of epsins led to Rac1 activation deﬁ ciencies ( 121 ) . Importantly , this interac - tion was shown to be essential for another polarity - dependent process : cell migration . Interestingly , epsins are enriched in the leading edge of migratory cells ( 121 , 122 ) , and epsin - 3 is selectively expressed in migratory keratinocytes ( 12 ) . Further , overexpresssion of epsins enhanced cell migration and invasion , with epsin - 3 being the most potent paralog for induction of this behavior ( 121 ) . Interestingly , upregulation of epsins has been reported in skin , breast , and lung cancers ( 12 – 14 , 123 ) . In addition , our lab also identiﬁ ed epsin - 3 expression in mouse pancreatic cancer models and in human pancreatic cancer cell lines , such as BxPC - 3 and Panc - 1 ( 15 , 121 ) . Furthermore , overexpression of epsin - 2 and - 3 in Madin Darby canine kidney cells induced morphological changes characterized by extended lamellipodia that prompted the epsin - transfected cells to migrate out of epithelial colonies ( 15 ) . Therefore , it is tempting to speculate that epsin upregu - lation can contribute to enhance cancer cell invasion in vivo by RhoGTPase ( Rac1 ) and notch signaling hyperactivation , and it constitutes an interesting possibility to be investigated . Nonclassical functions of epsins Apart from its role in endocytosis and signaling , epsin seem to be important for autophagy in Drosophila , as larvae lack - ing Lqf are unable to form autophagosomes ( 101 ) . Further , epsin has been reported to accumulate in the nucleus follow - ing inhibition of nuclear export and to be involved in regu - lation of transcription ( 24 , 124 ) . Additionally , the ability of epsin to induce membrane curvature is important for proper mitotic membrane organization ( 125 ) . Interaction of epsin with microtubules has also been reported ( 126 ) . Perspectives Epsin is a multifaceted protein that apart from its classical role in cargo recognition and endocytic network stabiliza - tion , plays a crucial role in signaling . Epsin is required for the activation of the notch pathway , and it affects RhoGTPase signaling . Therefore , we propose that epsins are proteins that coordinate endocytosis and signaling in time and space . This coordination between endocytosis and signaling is of utmost importance because efﬁ cient functioning of one requires precise regulation by the other . For example , work in yeast has demonstrated that the polarized distribution of signaling molecules , such as Cdc42 regulates membrane trafﬁ cking , which in turn reinforces polarization ( 127 , 128 ) 122 A . Sen et al . [ recently reviewed in ( 129 ) ] . The establishment and mainte - nance of such polarized regions is crucial for eukaryotic cel - lular organization and impacts central functions , such as cell viability , cell fate speciﬁ cation , and cellular migration . Thus , it is not surprising that epsin is required for cell via - bility ( yeast ) , proper embryo development ( ﬂ ies and mice ) , as well as establishment of cell polarity and functions associated with it ( e . g . , cytokinesis , cell migration , and invasion ) . Unlike other endocytic proteins [ reviewed in ( 130 ) ] , the epsins ( par - ticularly epsin - 3 ) are found to be upregulated in cancer cells . Although a direct link to carcinogenesis remains to be estab - lished , the role of epsins in promoting cancer invasion is a promising direction to be explored . Acknowledgments We thank Drs .
