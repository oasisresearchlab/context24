In this study , the development of intelligence , measured traditionally , i . e . , operating within well - de ﬁ ned problem spaces ( Standard Progressive Matrices ) was compared with the development of intelligence operating in ill - de ﬁ ned problem spaces ( Creative Reasoning Task ) and the development of creativity ( Test of Creative Thinking - Drawing Production ) , in primary school children ( N = 175 ) across four grade levels . Results showed that problem space matters : Traditional intelligence test scores increased regularly with grade level , whereas creativity , as well as intelligence operating in an ill - de ﬁ ned problem space , developed irregularly but similarly . This suggests that when creativity is fostered , intelligence ’ s ability to operate in ill - de ﬁ ned problem space may be fostered , likewise . Guilford ( 1956 ) de ﬁ ned the concepts of convergent and divergent thinking . He described convergent thinking as the ability to search for a speci ﬁ c solution in well - de ﬁ ned problem spaces , and divergent thinking as the ability to generate ideas of a certain quantity ( ﬂ uency ) , variety ( ﬂ ex - ibility ) and exceptionality ( originality or relative frequency ; cf . Guilford , 1967 ) in ill - de ﬁ ned problem spaces . Problem spaces are representations of sets of possible and logical steps that one must take to ﬁ nd the ﬁ nal solution . This is true for problems that present themselves as clear and synoptic situations to the one who will solve them , and for problems that were hitherto unperceived and have to be formulated by the perceiver . The former situation requires the ability of problem solving , the latter the ability of problem ﬁ nding ( Carson & Runco , 1999 ; Kim , 2011 ; Runco , 1994 ) . Convergent thinking is considered to be an important subset of intelligence ( Sternberg , 1982 ) , whereas divergent thinking is the cognitive process most commonly linked with creativity ( Plucker & Renzulli , 1999 ) . Despite the fact that Guilford ( 1956 ) considered convergent and divergent thinking as related concepts , intelligence and creativity have been studied as two separate constructs . Here , the focus is on children ’ s development of intelligence and creativity considering both as two distinct constructs . Research on the development of intelligence revealed that performances on intelligence tests correlate positively with chronological age and advancement in school education ( Brouwers , Van de Vijver , & Van Hemert , 2009 ; Ceci , 1991 ; Ceci & Williams , 1997 ; McArdle , Ferrer - Caja , Hamagami , & Woodcock , 2002 ; Neisser et al . , 1996 ) . The latter was found to be the best predictor of performance on intelligence tests ( Brouwers et al . , 2009 ) . This means that the development of a child ’ s intelligence is directly affected by school attendance ( Ceci , 1991 ; Ceci & Williams , 1997 ; Neisser et al . , 1996 ) , but also that “ schooling fosters the development of cognitive pro - cesses that underpin performance on most IQ tests ” ( Ceci , 1991 , p . 703 ) . Research on the development of creativity revealed less con - sistent results . Some researchers found a positive correlation between creativity and chronological age or advancement in school education ( e . g . Chae , 2003 ; Claxton , Pannells , & Rhoads , 2005 ) , whereas others even described a decrease in creativity associated with increasing age / grade ( e . g . Kim , 2011 ; Torrance , 1968 ) .

Using a longitudinal design , he found evidence for a decline in creativity in fourth - grade children , which he called the fourth - grade slump . Torrance ( 1968 , 1995 ) general - ized that children in grade 3 are more creative than children in grade 4 . According to Nash ( 1974 ) , this “ slump ” is a “ result of increasing peer group pressure for conforming behavior around age nine or ten ” ( p . 170 ) . Charles and Runco ( 2000 ) found that the fourth grade slump is restricted to certain aspects of creativ - ity ; although ﬂ uency of ideas increased , the proportion of appro - priate ideas declined with grade level . Several authors emphasized the impact that the educa - tional environment has on creativity ( Maker , Jo , & Muammar , 2008 ) , either fostering its development or incit - ing its decline ( Lubart & Georgsdottir , 2004 ) . According to Besançon and Lubart ( 2008 ) , “ The main goals of most educational systems are to transmit knowledge , rigorous working habits , and societal values ” ( p . 381 ) . These goals form the basis of most educational curricula . Hence , these curricula may place more emphasis on convergent thinking than on divergent thinking , and this may be the reason why the development of creativity and intelligence yield different patterns of development ( Houtz , Rosen ﬁ eld , & Tetenbaum , 1978 ) . Up to now , however , in studies comparing the develop - ment of intelligence and creativity , the intelligence mea - sures considered came from tests in which cognition operates in a well - de ﬁ ned problem space , i . e . , where the task is to ﬁ nd the one and only correct answer . Creativity measures , on the contrary , came from tests operating in an ill - de ﬁ ned problem space , where the task is to generate as many ideas as possible . Therefore , it cannot be af ﬁ rmed whether , if a difference between the development of intel - ligence and creativity is found , would in fact be due to the application of the different cognitive abilities related to both constructs or rather due to the differences in problem spaces in which these operate . What would be expected when intelligence is measured operating in an ill - de ﬁ ned problem space ? Recent research suggests that intelligence can , in fact , be measured and studied operating in ill - de ﬁ ned problem space situations ( Jaarsveld et al . , 2015 ) . This research shows that intelligence measured in ill - de ﬁ ned problem spaces functions differently from intelli - gence measured in well - de ﬁ ned problem spaces ( Jaarsveld , Lachmann , Hamel , & van Leeuwen , 2010 ; Jaarsveld , Lachmann , & van Leeuwen , 2012 ) . Jaarsveld et al . ( 2010 ) inferred that in a creative think - ing process , intelligence ( considered as mostly convergent thinking ) intertwines with creativity ( considered as mostly divergent thinking ) . Others have argued , as well , that crea - tivity works with intelligence ( Ambrose , 2009 ; Cropley , 2006 ; Runco , 2003 ) . This intertwining between convergent and divergent thinking is called creative reasoning , and it may be understood as the ability to generate original , yet appropriate , solutions ( Jaarsveld et al . , 2010 , 2012 ) . In other words , both convergent and divergent thinking inter - twine within a cognitive process that emerges from a problem task or a problematic situation for which no solu - tion is readily available . Therefore , both abilities mutually contribute to generating a solution , which emerges after several alternating stages of convergent and divergent thinking ( Jaarsveld et al . , 2015 ; Jaarsveld & van Leeuwen , 2005 ) . In this process , both abilities are addressed ; divergent thinking creates new approaches and ideas , and convergent thinking ensures that the correct choices are taken and that the logical aspects of the solu - tion are considered ( Jaarsveld & van Leeuwen , 2005 ) . Aiming to measure this cooperative cognitive process , a new , innovative measurement method , called the creative reasoning task ( CRT ) , was developed ( detailed information about the CRT is presented in the method section ; see also Jaarsveld et al . , 2010 , 2012 ) . In our study , the development of intelligence ( operating in closed problem spaces ) and creativity in primary school children of grades 1 – 4 was compared . Both were related to the development of intelligence operating in ill - de ﬁ ned problem space . Taking into consideration ﬁ ndings of research on intelligence and creativity , the hypotheses were : ( a ) Traditionally measured intelligence will develop continually across grade level and ( b ) creativity will develop irregularly . The main research question is whether intelligence measured in ill - de ﬁ ned problem spaces , i . e . creative reasoning , develops more like traditional intelli - gence or more like creativity . In other words , is the differ - ence in development between intelligence and creativity found in previous research due to cognitive abilities related to these constructs or to the problem space in which they operate ? METHOD Participants At the start of the school year , a sample of 175 primary school children from Grade 1 to Grade 4 ( between 6 and 10 years old ) was tested . State authorities approved this study and parents consented to the participation of their children . Children were informed that they could end their participation at any time during the session if for any reason they felt uncomfortable ; one female child did so and , accordingly , her results were excluded from the study . Also excluded were eight children ( all Grade 1 ) who pro - duced a SPM answer form that was invalid because several solutions were marked . Hence , the ﬁ nal sample was com - posed of 166 children ( 89 male and 77 female ) . Per grade , number of participants and mean ages in years were as follows : Grade 1 ( M = 6 . 28 , N = 25 ) , Grade 2 ( M = 7 . 00 , N = 61 ) , Grade 3 ( M = 8 . 05 , N = 39 ) , Grade 4 ( M = 9 . 17 , N = 41 ) . 126 M . M . WELTER ET AL . Material Traditional intelligence and creativity were investigated with the paper - and - pencil version of standardized tests , the Standard Progressive Matrices test ( SPM , Raven , 1998 ) and the Test of Creative Thinking - Drawing Production ( TCT - DP , Urban & Jellen , 1995 ) . respectively . Additionally , the CRT ( Jaarsveld et al . , 2010 , 2012 ) was used to test intelligence operating in an ill - de ﬁ ned problem space . SPM The SPM ( Raven , 1998 ) is a nonverbal intelligence test consisting of 60 items grouped in ﬁ ve sets . Each of the items comprises an incomplete pattern presented in the form of a 1 × 1 , 2 × 2 or 3 × 3 matrix . Participants are asked to complete the pattern by choosing a ﬁ gure from six or eight possible solution options given below the matrix . The maximum score is 60 points , because each item is ﬁ xed as pass or fail . The items are , at ﬁ rst , easy and simple , but become increasingly more dif ﬁ cult within and across sets , requiring higher levels of cognitive abilities to encode and analyze information ( Raven , 2009 ) . The individual test pro - cessing time and the dif ﬁ culty progression of the SPM items are functional in assessing the extent of clear thinking ( Heller , Kratzmeier , & Lengfelder , 1998 ) . The SPM was intended to capture cognitive ability in as many age groups as possible , regardless of education , nationality , or health condition ( Heller et al . , 1998 ) . Raven intended to develop a test that is easy to administer , is clear to interpret , and could be employed to individuals of differ - ent ages ( from 6 years on ) and socio - economic backgrounds ( Raven , 2009 ) , who all have to solve the same set of tasks in the same order ( Heller et al . , 1998 ) . TCT - DP The TCT - DP ( Urban & Jellen , 1995 ) is a test for the measurement of an individual ’ s creative thinking potential . It can be used to identify very high creative potential , as well as to recognize individuals with underdeveloped crea - tive abilities , who may be in need of stimulation and support ( Urban & Jellen , 1995 ) . The test contains two answering forms ( form A and form B ) both providing six ﬁ gure fragments in a square frame , inspiring further drawing . Based on these fragments , the respondent is requested to complete the drawing in a free and open way . The fragments are : semicircle , dot , large right angle , curved line , broken line , and a small open square outside the frame ( Urban & Jellen , 1995 ) . The drawing is evaluated and scored by means of 14 criteria that can deliver up to six raw points each , except for the four criteria of unconventionality which are valued at a maximum of 3 points ( maximum score = 72 ) . The criteria are : continuations , completions , new elements , connections made with a line , connections made to produce a theme , boundary breaking that is fragment dependent , boundary breaking that is fragment independent , perspective , humor and affectivity , unconventionality A , unconventionality B , unconventionality C , unconventionality D , and speed . The test is applicable in a single or group testing with indivi - duals aged between 5 and 95 years with administration requiring 15 min . CRT The CRT is a diagnostic device that measures intelli - gence and creativity intertwined in an ill - de ﬁ ned problem space . This is in contrast to traditional intelligence tests that measure intelligence in a well - de ﬁ ned problem space ( Jaarsveld et al . , 2010 , 2012 ) . The CRT involves generating components and generating relationship ( s ) that connect these components ; it thus represents a cognitive thinking process in which both intelligent and creative abilities inter - act ( Jaarsveld et al . , 2015 ) . This interaction evolved as a cognitive mechanism when human survival depended on ﬁ nding effective solutions to both common and novel pro - blem situations ( Gabora & Kaufman , 2010 ; Runco , 2003 ) . Creative reasoning solves that minority of problems that are unforeseen and yet of high adaptability ( Jung , 2014 ) . The CRT is a creative reasoning test because individuals have to reason creatively . They are directed to thinking creatively because the task comes with an open problem space : The constraints of the task are ill - de ﬁ ned . The instruc - tion asks them “ to create a matrix that is as original and as dif ﬁ cult to solve as possible . ” Hence , individuals are urged to apply their reasoning abilities in creating a matrix that never existed before but is nevertheless solvable by another person . The CRT is a creativity test because each individual creates her or his own matrix . The matrix is created on a blank form with only the outlines of a 3 × 3 matrix showing . Each created matrix is different . The frequency distributions of components and relationships created in the CRT do not compare to those of the components and relationships solved in the SPM ( Jaarsveld et al . , 2010 , 2012 ; Jaarsveld , Lachmann , & van Leeuwen , 2013 ) . In fact , created matrices ( Jaarsveld et al . , 2015 ; N = 52 , 19 – 42 years old ) were shown features not contained in the SPM , like original intertwining of relationships , components that are not exclu - sively geometrical , and three - dimensionality . For this study three test forms were applied , each corre - sponded to one of the three possible types of matrix formats contained in the SPM : 1 × 1 ( continuous pattern ) ; 2 × 2 and 3 × 3 . The ﬁ gure that completes the matrix should be drawn within the matrix in the outlined square in the lower right corner . Children were free in their choice of test form . The CRT contains two subscores : one for intelligence in an ill - de ﬁ ned problem space , i . e . , CRT - Relations ( CRT - R ) , and one for creativity , i . e . , CRT - Components & Speci ﬁ cations ( CRT - C ) . Due to the research question and design , the latter was not used in the present study . THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTELLIGENCE AND CREATIVITY 127 The CRT - R score represents the logic and coherence in a pattern of components for a matrix that was created and it is evaluated by means of de ﬁ ned relations that can deliver up to 128 raw points . These relations are : matrix 1 × 1 ( idio - syncratic and semantic coherence , jigsaw , and pattern com - pletion ) ; string ( iteration of one component and iteration of two or > 2 components ) ; matrix 2 × 2 ( symmetry , change , increase , and succession ) ; and matrix 3 × 3 ( change , increase , succession , combination , indication of mathema - tical operation , and two values , see Jaarsveld et al . , 2012 for detailed information ) . However , as the CRT deals with ill - de ﬁ ned space problems , it is therefore impossible to ﬁ x a set of evaluation criteria for all possible solutions . Procedure The tests were performed during the ﬁ rst weeks of the school year . Children were tested in groups during class time . All tests were performed within one session . Children were asked to work alone and quietly . To facilitate this , they were seated suf ﬁ ciently far away from each other . Two researchers con - ducted the session without the teacher being present . Children were asked ﬁ rst to perform the SPM ( 45 min ) , then to generate a SPM - style item in the CRT ( 20 min ) , and ﬁ nally , to complete the TCT - DP ( 15 min ; Form A ) . The appropriate instruction was given to the whole group before each of the tests . Those children who ﬁ nished a test before the given time limit were allowed to read books that lay ready to this purpose . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The Kolmogorov - Smirnov test con ﬁ rmed normal distribu - tion of the data . Therefore , to test the effect of grade level on intelligence ( SPM and CRT - R ) and creativity ( TCT - DP ) scores , analyses of variance ( ANOVA ) were run . Because a Levene ’ s test revealed that the assumption of homogeneity of variances was violated , the nonparametric Kruskal - Wallis - Test was performed additionally . Moreover , bivariate Pearson ’ s correlations were performed between grade , gen - der , and the raw scores of the three dependent variables . Means and standard deviations of the SPM , CRT - R , and TCT - DP raw scores are presented in Table 1 . Results of the Pearson ’ s correlation showed that grade correlated positively with mean scores of all applied tests , the SPM ( r = . 654 , p < . 001 , N = 166 ) , the CRT - R ( r = . 356 , p < . 001 , N = 166 ) , and the TCT - DP ( r = . 440 , p < . 001 , N = 166 ) . This suggests that children in higher grades performed superiorly in comparison to children from lower grades on the traditional intelligence test , on the intelligence test operating in an ill - de ﬁ ned problem space , and on the creativity test . There was no correlation between the depen - dent variables and gender . Partial Pearson ’ s correlation performed within the whole sample between SPM , TCT - DP , CRT - R raw scores , controlled for grade , revealed no correlation . However , correlation analyses performed separately within each grade level showed signi ﬁ - cance in Grade 4 ( N = 41 ) between the following scores : SPM and CRT - R , r = . 313 , p ( two - tailed ) = . 046 , p ( one - tailed ) = . 023 ; SPM and TCT - DP , r = . 339 , p ( two - tailed ) = . 030 , p ( one - tailed ) = . 015 . For the other grade levels no correlations were found . Similar results were obtained by Jaarsveld et al . ( 2012 ; N = 205 , 6 – 10 y old ; SPM raw scores correlated with those of CRT - R , r = . 192 , p < . 01 and with those of the TCT - DP , r = . 225 , p < . 001 ) . Regarding intelligence , ANOVA results indicated a main effect of Grade on both intelligence test measures : SPM , F ( 3 , 162 ) = 43 . 870 , p < . 001 , η 2 p = . 448 , and CRT - R , F ( 3 , 162 ) = 10 . 094 , p < . 001 , η 2 p = . 157 . The nonparametric Kruskal - Wallis - Test revealed the same pattern of results as the ANOVA , H ( 3 ) = 79 . 059 , p < . 001 for SPM and H ( 3 ) = 28 . 002 , p < . 001 for CRT - R . The SPM mean scores increased regularly through grade levels ( see Figure 1a ) ; Bonferroni post - hoc analysis revealed a signi ﬁ cant increase from grade 1 to grade 2 ( p = . 016 ) , and from grade 2 to grade 3 ( p < . 001 ) . The increase from grade 3 to 4 reached the 5 % criterion of signi ﬁ cance for an independent pairwise t - test , but it failed after conservative Bonferoni correc - tion . In contrast to the SPM scores , the CRT - R scores improved irregularly with grade level ( Figure 1b ) , i . e . , there was a signi ﬁ - cant increase from grade 2 to grade 3 ( p = . 001 ) only ; no differences were observed between grade 1 and grade 2 and between grade 3 and grade 4 . Regarding creativity , results showed that TCT - DP scores presented a main effect of grade , F ( 3 , 162 ) = 13 . 781 , p < . 001 , η 2 p = . 203 . In accordance with the ANOVA , the nonparametric Kruskal - Wallis - Test also showed a signi ﬁ cant effect of grade , H ( 3 ) = 35 . 825 , p < . 001 . For TCT - DP scores , there was an irregular increase with grade level , similar to the results for the CRT - R ( Figure 1c ) , i . e . , Bonferroni post - hoc analysis showed a signi ﬁ cant increase only between grades 2 and 3 . Results showed that traditionally measured intelligence develops more regularly across grade levels than creativity . Interestingly , intelligence measured in an ill - de ﬁ ned problem TABLE 1 Means and ( standard deviations ) of raw scores of SPM , CRT - R and TCT - DP by grade levels Test Grade 1 ( N = 25 ) Grade 2 ( N = 61 ) Grade 3 ( N = 39 ) Grade 4 ( N = 41 ) SPM 24 . 80 ( 8 . 78 ) 30 . 48 ( 9 . 57 ) 40 . 67 ( 6 . 43 ) 43 . 54 ( 5 . 07 ) CRT - R 7 . 32 ( 12 . 49 ) 6 . 59 ( 11 . 40 ) 20 . 77 ( 18 . 62 ) 22 . 41 ( 24 . 63 ) TCT - DP 9 . 52 ( 4 . 74 ) 11 . 56 ( 6 . 02 ) 16 . 59 ( 6 . 02 ) 18 . 27 ( 8 . 80 ) Note .

WELTER ET AL . space showed a pattern of development comparable to the one presented by creativity ; a step function where the scores remained the same over the ﬁ rst two grade levels , with a sig - ni ﬁ cant peak in grade 3 and no further change in grade 4 . This ﬁ nding indicates that problem space matters and not necessarily the application of the different cognitive abilities related to the constructs of intelligence and creativity . In other words , it is the character of the problem space , being well - or ill - de ﬁ ned , which offers different possibilities for an individual ’ s cognitive abilities . In tasks with a well - de ﬁ ned problem space , different abilities are addressed than in tasks with an ill - de ﬁ ned space . Intelligence operating an in ill - de ﬁ ned space seems to compare better to creativity , which also unfolds in ill - de ﬁ ned spaces , than to intelligence oper - ating in a well - de ﬁ ned space . Thus , it seems that cognitive processes addressed and operating in well - de ﬁ ned problem spaces develop differently from those addressed and operat - ing in ill - de ﬁ ned spaces . GENERAL DISCUSSION Results showed , ﬁ rst , that difference in the development between intelligence and creativity can be ascribed to the differences in problem space in which cognitive abilities operate . Second , when children developed abilities that help them ﬁ nd the one and only correct solution , they do not necessarily develop abilities that help them ﬁ nd new and appropriate solutions . Traditional intelligence displayed a continual growth throughout grade levels indicating a stable and continuous development . This result is common in the literature ; per - formance on intelligence tests correlates with chronological age and advancement in school education ( Brouwers et al . , 2009 ; Ceci , 1991 ; Ceci & Williams , 1997 ; McArdle et al . , 2002 ; Neisser et al . , 1996 ; Welter , Jaarsveld , van Leeuwen , & Lachmann , 2016 ) . In a cross - cultural meta - analysis , Brouwers et al . ( 2009 ) found that the performance of FIGURE 1 Means and standard errors of the raw scores of the SPM ( a ) , the CRT - R ( b ) and of the TCT - DP ( c ) for the four grade levels . * = p < . 05 , * * = p < . 01 ; * * * = p < . 001 ( Bonferroni post - hoc analysis , except for SPM ( a ) between Grade 3 and 4 : t - test without Bonferroni correction ) . THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTELLIGENCE AND CREATIVITY 129 children on Raven ’ s progressive matrices increased across childhood . Findings showed a positive correlation between advancement in school education and test scores ; advance - ment in school education was found to be the best predictor of performance on intelligence tests ( Brouwers et al . , 2009 ) . The relationship between advancement in school educa - tion and SPM test scores may occur because the SPM requires cognitive abilities that are nurtured and trained in school ( Ceci , 1991 ; Jaarsveld et al . , 2012 ) . Alternatively , the relationship could re ﬂ ect a more general effect of cognitive development : the way the SPM was constructed , i . e . , with increasing item complexity , gives bene ﬁ t to older children who are more advanced in general cognitive development ( Jaarsveld et al . , 2012 ) . Normally , both factors work together ; the older a child gets , the better it can manipulate complex relationships and , the older a child gets , the longer it has bene ﬁ ted from the educational system . Creativity ﬁ ndings showed only an increase in scores from grade 2 to grade 3 . This suggests a possible stagnation in the development of creativity . As reported in creativity research , some decreases in creativity scores may happen in certain stages of the development ( e . g . , Kim , 2011 ; Torrance , 1968 ) . Torrance ( 1968 ) observed a decline in creativity scores of fourth grade children , the fourth grade slump . Our results cannot be characterized as a slump ( decline in score , as found by Torrance ) , but rather as a slowdown or a stagnation . Charles and Runco ( 2000 ) found that the development of creativity in grade 4 depends on what aspects are measured ; while the ﬂ uency of ideas increases from grade 3 to grade 4 , the proportion of appro - priate ideas declines . This task involves both aspects , with a focus of ﬂ uency ( Urban , 2005 ) . This may explain why there is neither a signi ﬁ cant increase nor a decrease in the present data . These results are also in accordance with other studies reporting stagnations in creativity scores for the TCT - DP . For instance , Urban & Jellen ( 1995 ) found that , on average , tests scores increase with grade level . However , the improvement was not linear , but showed a step - like pattern with a plateau pro ﬁ le after grade 5 . Theurer , Berner , and Lipowsky ( 2012 ) , tested children in three sessions ; at the beginning of the ﬁ rst school year , at the end of the second school year , and at the end of the fourth school year . They found a discontinuous pattern of development of creativity ; children ’ s creative performance stagnated after the end of the second year . Besançon and Lubart ( 2008 ) tested 211 children in two sessions . Their results showed an in ﬂ uence of grade on the creative performance . Children who went from third to fourth grade showed less improvement than children who advanced to grade 2 or grade 3 . It can be inferred that traditional intelligence and crea - tivity developed differently across grade levels , with intelli - gence growing continually and creativity developing in an irregular way presenting peaks and periods of what seemed to be a stagnation . According to Houtz et al . ( 1978 ) , this discrepancy may be a consequence of educational curricula , which , throughout grade levels , focus increasingly on con - vergent thinking . Therefore , schools should take reasonable steps to guide children in their creative development ( Lubart & Georgsdottir , 2004 ; Maker et al . , 2008 ) , changing from an approach that emphasizes recognition and memorization of information to one that challenges children not only to think creatively and to explore the unknown ( Beghetto , 2010 ; Smith & Smith , 2010 ; Torrance , 1972 , 1987 ) , but also to ﬁ nd and then formulate problems for which no ready avail - able answer is at hand ( Carson & Runco , 1999 ; Getzels , 1987 ; Kim , 2011 ; Runco , 1994 ) . These ﬁ ndings suggest that intelligence measured in an ill - de ﬁ ned problem space developed differently from tradi - tionally measured intelligence , but similarly to creativity . This means that the problem space of tests should be considered in interpreting developmental patterns . The dif - ference found in the developmental patterns of both intelli - gence measurements con ﬁ rms what was highlighted by Jaarsveld et al . ( 2010 , 2012 ) : intelligence operates differ - ently in well - de ﬁ ned and ill - de ﬁ ned problem spaces . According to Jaarsveld et al . ( 2012 ) , this difference may occur because the performance on the SPM requires abil - ities that are more likely to be trained in school than the abilities required for the CRT in which no solution is readily available . School education mainly aims at devel - oping abilities that help to ﬁ nd the one and only correct solution . The similarity in development between creativity and intelligence measured in an ill - de ﬁ ned problem space indi - cates that similar abilities are needed when performing ill - de ﬁ ned tasks ; i . e . , intelligence operating in an ill - de ﬁ ned problem space requires abilities that typically are requested in creativity tests . This fact may imply that in fostering creativity , the abilities related to intelligence operating in ill - de ﬁ ned problem spaces may be fostered , as well . This last observation is not only of theoretical relevance , but is also of very practical importance . All observations and implications made about the educational setting in rela - tion to children ’ s creativity are also valid in relation to intelligence measured in ill - de ﬁ ned problem space situa - tions . In these types of situations , children are encouraged to generate , rather than only solve problems . This was already emphasized by Kim ( 2011 ) : Children should be encouraged to ﬁ nd and recognize problems , rather than be offered problems to solve . In sum , these results show that problem space matters : intelligence functions differently in ill - de ﬁ ned and well - de ﬁ ned problem space situations . The cognitive abilities usually required for creativity tasks compare to those that intelligence requires when operating in ill - de ﬁ ned problem 130 M . M . WELTER ET AL . space . The results imply that when education does not attend to creative thinking , it might endanger intelligent thinking which is needed to ﬁ nd and solve problems for which no ready answer is available .
