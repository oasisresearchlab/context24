Electronic Supplementary Material ( ESI ) for Molecular BioSystems This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2011 Electronic Supplementary Material ( ESI ) for Molecular BioSystems This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2011 Supplementary discussion Four of the top seven putative targets from the ProtoArray screen are involved in vesicle trafficking thus have a functional link to the validated ones from the hEX1 array . Piccolo is a huge protein , over 5000 amino acids , which is found in the presynaptic active zone and is thought to act as a scaffold for vesicles and protein assemblies ( 2 , 3 ) . Kinesin light chain 2 is part of the kinesin assembly that transports vesicles ( 1 ) and cortactin is part of the clathrin - coated pits , where endocytosis is initiated ( 4 ) . SNAP - 23 is among the validated proteins found in the human protein ( hEx1 ) screen . Among the proteins with lower intensities in the ProtoArray screen is ARFGAP3 , a functional homologue of the validated protein ARFGAP2 . A brief summary of both validated and non - validated target proteins involved in vesicle trafficking grouped after functions is found in Table S3 . References 1 .
