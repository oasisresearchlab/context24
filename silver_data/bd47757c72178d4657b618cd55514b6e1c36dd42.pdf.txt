Introduction Generative AI has the potential to improve practical work in software engineering [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 ] . These technologies are powerful , but there are increas - ing - and increasingly diverse - potential risks of ap - plying generative AI to human work and human out - comes [ 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 ] . In a paper at the 2020 HAIGEN workshop , we explored potential future societal problems with generative AI through the use of partic - ipatory design fictions [ 10 ] . In those three fictions , we invited our colleagues to speculate on possible societal harms from generative AI applications . Here , we shift our strategy toward workplaces , and we try to take a more balanced view , considering both poten - tial benefits and potential risks of generative applications in workplaces of the future .

We adopt a different strategy based on design fictions as a research method [ 16 , 17 ] that al - lows us to consider a set of related benefits and risks of generative AI applications that might be used in future workplaces . We contribute • an interrelated set of speculations regarding fu - ture generative AI applications in workplaces , and • a consideration of some value tensions that may emerge between employee needs and organiza - tional needs We also critique our work as being half - done , and we describe possible ways to complete the work in the near future . 2 . Background 2 . 1 . Generative AI for Software Engineering One of the strengths of generative algorithms and ap - plications is their ability to create instances from a ”learned” class of examples , including projects that in - volve images [ 18 , 19 , 20 ] , videos [ 21 ] , music [ 22 , 23 ] , molecules [ 24 , 25 ] , texts of many types [ 26 , 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 ] , and diverse other media and categories ( e . g . , [ 31 , 32 , 33 ] ) . When analyzed as sequences of tokens , these ”learned” patterns can function as predictions of ( e . g . ) the next word in a text or a software program ; this ”next - in - sequence” aspect is a major focus of this paper , here extended to the ”next” user actions . While there is not space in this position paper to review the rich history of generative algorithms , we note briefly that many reports describe generative AI applications with both potential benefits [ 34 , 35 , 36 ] and potential risks [ 37 , 38 , 39 , 14 , 12 , 10 ] to individuals or societies . Our team have been studying how generative application scan provide significant value to software engineers [ 26 , 8 , 28 , 40 ] , and our IUI 2022 paper reports measurable successes [ 27 ] . In this position paper , we ask what types of instances might be created in the future , and whether organizations or societies may wish to place limits on the generation of certain types of instances . In the history of theorizing mixed - initiative dynam - ics between humans and AIs , most scholars have imag - ined batch - like processes in which one party ( human or AI ) takes a first major step , and the second party ( AI or human ) completes the work through a second major step [ 41 , 42 , 43 , 44 , 45 , 46 , 47 , 48 ] . While Conversational User Interfaces ( CUIs ) provide limited forms of on - going interactions , the sheer computational requirements of generative AI algorithms have made it difficult to de - sign and build generative dialogic applications until re - cently ( e . g . , [ 49 , 50 , 51 ] ) . An important problem in these dialogs will be how to control the generative AI execution from moment - to - moment - i . e . , how to ”tune” [ 52 , 53 ] or ”steer” [ 22 , 23 ] the algorithm toward outcomes of value to their human partners . We speculate on how possible control - parameters might be provided to human users , and how particular values of those parameters might be recommended through content - based or social - based algorithms . 2 . 2 . Design Fictions For more than a decade , scholars have used design fic - tions as a core research method [ 16 , 17 ] . Based on the - orizing by Peirce [ 54 ] over a century ago , Dunne and Martin summarized the potential of design fictions as abductive methods , stating that “The designers who can solve the most wicked problems do it through collabo - rative integrative thinking , using abduc - tive logic , which means the logic of what might be . Conversely , deductive and in - ductive logic are the logic of what should be or what is … [ 55 ] ( italics added ) Abductive reasoning has also been claimed as a major tool for creatively building theory in approaches such as grounded theory [ 56 , 57 , 58 , 59 ] and thematic analy - sis [ 60 , 61 ] . We apply future - oriented design fictions to extrapolate current phenomena and trends into possible futures [ 62 , 63 ] and to begin to interrogate those possible futures for their human implications and impacts [ 64 , 65 ] . We hope that design fictions can contribute to the mixed - initiative discussions mentioned earlier , focusing atten - tion the types of relationships that we envision between humans and AIs [ 47 , 66 ] . Design fictions may take several forms , including text , images , film , video , theatre , and physical objects [ 67 , 68 , 69 , 70 , 71 , 17 ] , and may be particularized into recog - nizable genres such as fictional job adverts [ 72 ] , enact - ments [ 73 ] , technology probes [ 74 , 75 , 76 ] , product cata - logs [ 74 ] , autobiographies [ 77 ] , and evenclearly - fictitious conference papers [ 78 , 79 ] . More familiarly , design fic - tions can take the form of stories [ 10 , 66 , 80 , 81 , 82 , 83 , 84 , 85 , 86 , 71 , 87 , 88 , 89 ] . We adopt the method of telling a story , through which we explore trends and possibilities at the intersection of technology , skilled human work , and values . 1 3 . Design Fiction 3 . 1 . Crafting the Design Fiction Design fiction scholars emphasize that a fiction should provide a perceptual bridge [ 90 ] between the reader and novel concepts that may be challenging [ 64 , 91 ] or even upsetting [ 74 , 66 , 10 ] . The temporary suspension of dis - belief is considered important [ 92 , 90 ] , and this is accom - plished through narrative integrity and consistency of the imagined world [ 85 , 93 ] and through empathy with its protagonists [ 94 , 95 ] . Auger states that ”careful man - agement of the speculation” is important , because ”if it strays too far . . . the audience will not relateto the proposal resulting in a lack of engagement or connection” [ 90 ] . Design fictions use methods such as diegesis ( the creation of a story - world ) to communicate new possibilities and to discuss their consequences [ 96 , 97 , 16 ] . We apply these principles by setting our story in a rec - ognizable software engineering workplace - albeit with futuristic tools and the gradual unveiling of an unsettling workplace culture . To avoid aspects of the ”uncanny valley” that can occur when AI agents behave in eerily human ways [ 98 , 15 ] , we designed the conversational style of the generative AI assistant - ”Your Programming Partner ( YPP ) ” - to be recognizably non - human - even robotic in some ways . 3 . 2 . Strategic Ambiguity While design fictions are usually crafted for specific intentions , it is also important that they act as cul - 1 Methodological treatments of how to approach or write design fictions may be found in Markussen and Knutz [ 16 ] , Sturdee et al . [ 17 ] , Huusko et al . huusko2018structuring , Blythe and Wright [ 65 ] , and Cheon and Su [ 77 ] ; see also Blythe and Encinas [ 68 ] and Baumer et al . [ 78 ] for approaches to assessing or evaluating design fictions . tural probes [ 99 ] , actively engaging the reader to form their own interpretations and to draw their own con - clusions [ 100 , 101 , 75 , 16 , 102 ] . Coulton et al . note that ”it seems that Design Fiction has ambiguity ‘baked in’ ” [ 103 ] , and researchers have tried to balance among diegetic factors such as familiarity and consistency , vs . the ambiguity that is needed to encourage new ( e . g . , ab - ductive [ 55 ] ) thinking among their readers [ 66 , 68 , 104 ] . The strategy of ambiguity can be particularly impor - tant if the fiction addresses value tensions [ 105 , 84 , 80 ] . Ambe [ 83 ] and Huusko [ 64 ] argue that many technology applications may have both utopian and dystopian impli - cations , and these implications may be different for differ - ent stakeholders [ 106 , 107 ] . Feminist technoscience con - vergently urges us to consider each person’s perspective , and to question power differentials [ 108 , 109 , 110 , 111 ] . We noted above that design fictions may be designed to raise challenging or upsetting questions . Using a for - mulation from Haraway’s feminist theorizing [ 112 ] , Son - dergaard et al . suggest that we need to ”stay with the trouble” of value tensions in AI : ”Might we allow the [ AI assistant ] to be not just good or bad , submissive or dom - inant , but a complicated , contradictory being ? . . . The future world serves as a pro - jection of current issues and conflicts , and thus the future becomes a way of looking at ourselves and our culture . ” [ 70 ] We tried to apply these rather open - ended concepts by deliberately leaving certain details unspecified , includ - ing the gender - identities of the actors , the nature of the actors in certain workplace roles , and the reasons for the loneliness that is experienced by the protagonist . We also presented certain potential value tensions in a relatively neutral way , to emphasize the questions rather than to impose premature closure on complex ethical topics . For brevity , we now proceed directly to the design fiction . Fiction Notes Drinking Chai with Your ( AI ) Programming Partner < 1 > Tikaani had been postponing work to translate the UX of the enormous BiggerFin application that their team was modernizing from its legacy Cobol code . So much had changed in the decades since BiggerFin was originally deployed . Everyone who had been on the original BiggerFin team had retired or moved on to other jobs . Generative translation technologies had become increasing accurate to convert the back - end code , but modernizing the UI was still a challenge for AIs . The UI remained a challenge because web - based UI technologies were now much better , and corporations’ expectations for what was considered ”good design” had also changed . Today was the day to do this ! And it would distract Tikaani from the loneliness of the office , with so many unoccupied desks . Fortunately , Tikaani had a conversational generative AI ( genAI ) assistant that could help , named ”Your Programming Partner” ( YPP ) . Motivation and Setting . Problems with legacy applica - tions [ 26 , 27 ] . Why is the office so empty ? Introduce the AI Assistant . < 2 > Tikaani opened the spec from the design team , and called up YPP . YPP displayed ”Greetings follow . Good morning , Tikaani . Today we will have a good day , a very good day , ” and followed with ”Adver - tisement follows . Try BerryBytes in the ByteBar . They’re brainfood . They can reduce any unwanted aftertastes . . . ” Establish YPP’s robotic voice , re - ducing the likelihood of uncanny valley effects [ 113 , 114 ] . Messages from multiple entities may be delivered through the YPP conversational interface . < 3 > During the previous modernization project , Tikaani had told YPP that its nickname was going to be ”Y” . Tikaani pressed the speech - to - text key , and said ”Y , please review the spec , ” and made a gesture to tell YPP which document was the spec . Personalization of the social pres - ence of the AI . Speech - to - text . Gestural component of UI . < 4 > “Drink chai , ” said YPP . Tikaani took a sip of chai . Introduce a theme that will become complexified later . < 5 > After a brief pause , YPP displayed , “To perform a generative trans - lation from spec to architecture . a set of examples is required . Recom - mendations follow : Finance / big - institution ; Finance / small - institution ; Corporate ; SMB ; or say ‘other’ for non - recommended domains . ” Each recommendation was displayed as a selectable button , so that Tikaani’s choice would immediately lead to action by YPP . Combined nature of recommenda - tions as both informational and ac - tionable . Fiction Notes < 6 > While it was true that BiggerFin was indeed a large financial client and would have been a partial match to “Finance / big - institution , ” the clients of BiggerFin for this service would be people and small businesses seeking micro - loans . Tikaani wanted to use a more social search strategy to make their choice . There was no one nearby to ask , so Tikaani typed , ”Display team members along with the number of financial projects they have worked on . ” YPP produced the list , again making each row of the displayed table into a button - for - action . Tikaani saw that Yu had worked on 20 similar projects . Yu had been Tikaani’s mentor when they joined the company , and Tikaani missed the days when they had traded ironic comments over tea . Tikaani gestured to the “Yu – Finance projects” row , and YPP accepted this gesture as a choice + command , and began to work . Human can override AI’s recom - mendation . . . . . . and can specify a different , more social way of choosing data . Introduce Yu as a colleague , to be complexified below . Similarly to < 5 > , each row of the display functions as both informa - tional and actionable . < 7 > YPP displayed , “Further guidance is required . Recommendations follow . ( 1 ) Granularity of microservices can be one of : micro , mini , or macro . Macro is recommended . ( 2 ) Optimization can be a weighted sum of : performance , maintainability , alignment - to - code , alignment - to - usage / natural - seams , alignment - to - data . Balanced weights are recommended . ” Tikaani revised the granularity to micro , and accepted YPP’s recommendations about optimization weights . Build YPP’s robotic nature through engineering - style passive voice . Show multiple ”tunable param - eters” of the generative algo - rithm [ 115 , 116 , 117 ] . Human can revise recommenda - tion or accept as - is . < 8 > YPP asked , ”You usually prefer a JupyterGen notebook rather than VSEdit . Decision required : Should a JupyterGen notebook with your usual defaults be used for this project ? ” YPP has ”learned” a generative model of Tikaani’s actions from past projects , and has predicted Tikaani’s most likely ”next action” today , saving Tikaani’s time in the notebook . < 9 > YPP opened a JupyterGen notebook on Tikaani’s display , and prepopulated the first cell with relevant Python libraries . Some of the libraries were open source , and some were proprietary libraries used to brand the modernized UXs as the company’s products . YPP wrote major module names into the markdown cells that preceded each code cell , and added draft documentation for the classes that each code cell would contain . YPP wrote stub code into some cells , and proposed full implementations into other cells . Generative AI provides partial re - sults for human to complete [ 26 ] . Fiction Notes < 10 > As YPP began to display the coding strategy into the shared Slack channel , Tikaani finished their sip of chai and put their cup down . Now that YPP was doing most of the work , Tikaani could relax and watch it unfold . They knew that they would need to review YPP’s code , but they hadn’t had to correct YPP’s architectural assumptions during the past year . YPP called Tikaani’s attention to lower - confidence code , and Tikaani made edits as needed . Tikaani was impressed that ”Y” had learned so much of Tikaani’s individual coding practices during their last year together . It was true that Tikaani missed the days when people actually had to solve their own coding problems without genAI support . But work with ”Y” was easier , and much faster , and actually produced fewer bugs . This day of work with ”Y” , while maybe a little bit boring , was going to be a highly productive and also pleasurable - perhaps , indeed , a very good day . Reflection on how the human’s role has changed - mostly for the better . AI flags low - confidence outcomes for human action . User modeling . Benefits of human + genAI collabo - ration . < 11 > YPP displayed , ”Recognition follows . You earned 5 BerryByte points . Points were downloaded to your ID chip . Don’t forget to redeem them at the ByteBar . ” And after a moment , ”CyberHR hope that this recognition will help you to have a good day , a very good day . ” Incentives delivered through the conversational UI . < 12 > “Drink chai , ” YPP said . Tikaani took a sip of chai . < 13 > Tikaani began to perform a detailed review of the code that YPP had generated . As Tikaani opened a generic class , YPP displayed , ”There are alternative modules to consider . Actionable Explanation follows . Class QuikClientPortfolio ( ) from commercial package QuikFi - nance would be 20 % faster , but has license fees that are usually $ 5k to $ 8k . Do you want to use QuikClientPortfolio ( ) and submit a request for approval ? ” AI initiates consultation , but allows human to make the business deci - sion . < 14 > Unsure of how to make the decision , Tikaani typed , ”Inquire through YourPartnetNet for colleagues who have knowledge of Quik - ClientPortfolio . Poll ’Which release of QuikClientPortfolio is stable ? ’ and indicate my status as Blocked . Use probable - knowldege feature . Anonymous responses are acceptable . ” < 15 > A minute later , YPP displayed , ”6 colleagues responded . 5 said Re - lease 15 . 3 is stable . 1 said Release 15 . 1 is stable . Two non - anonymized names are available . ” The network of ”Partner” AIs func - tions as a Transactional Memory System ( TMS ) [ 118 ] . It stores records of ”who knows what” [ 119 , 120 ] , and it ”learns” each em - ployee’s knowledge trajectory , so that it can generate probable knowledge - states based on past ac - tivities [ 121 ] . < 16 > Tikaani decided to accept the majority opinion . They typed , ”Estimate likelihood of approval for QuikClientPortfolio Release 15 . 3 , based on data from the current year only . ” < 17 > YPP displayed , ”Estimation follows . Package QuikFinance has been approved on 82 % of projects this year . Based on your personal history with requests , likelihood of approval for you is 90 % . ” Then YPP repeated , ”Do you want to use QuikClientPortfolio ( ) and submit a request for approval ? ” AI can access the human’s personal history of this category of request . Reinforce the robotic - voice repeti - tion of the question . Fiction Notes < 18 > Tikaani pressed the speech - to - text key and said , ”Paste Quik - ClientPortfolio , generate documentation of the decision rationale via GPT - neo and display it . ” YPP generated the rationale . Tikaani re - viewed , and made two corrections . Tikaani said “Send request for approval , and add to my personal log . ” YPP displayed each step as it completed it . Generative production of request - for - approval . Generative AI provides partial results for the human to com - plete [ 26 ] . < 19 > “Drink chai , ” YPP said . Tikaani sipped . < 20 > Tikaani found a serious domain - related problem in one of YPP’s generated modules . Apparently YPP didn’t understand that micro - financing often involved clients with little collateral and incomplete credit histories . Tikaani knew that there would need to be additional factors added to the model . They began to rewrite the generated class from scratch . YPP issued a first warning : ”The recommended module for this functionality is based on the MonthProjection ( ) class from the FinBlast library . ” Tikaani continued to write code . Human contextual knowledge is uniquely informative [ 122 , 123 ] . However , the human is violating work norms . The human is stubborn . < 21 > YPP continued , “Explanation follows . The estimated cost in work time for writing your own version is 3 - 5 hours for you , plus 2 - 4 hours for the QA team to test your new code , with a heightened risk of bugs of 34 % . Required action follows . ( 1 ) provide rationale for writing your own version of this module ; then ( 2 ) shift your work to a different module while ( 3 ) your rationale is automatically sent to your team - lead for approval . Full disclosure follows . There is a possibility that your team - lead will need to ( 4 ) auto - escalate your rationale to higher human management for further review . This may include a review of your user profile , with possible modification to your profile . ” AI explains the costs of the human action . . . . . . and the approvals process that the human must follow . . . . . . including a policy - based risk . < 22 > Tikaani sighed . They wrote the rationale , and moved on to the next one of YPP’s generated documentation markdown cells . This day was looking less pleasurable . AI has become a projection of ex - ecutive policy and power [ 124 ] . < 23 > YPP played an audio clip and displayed , “CyberHR offer follows . You could be eligible for the BOGIE program . Buy Out Generative Image of Employee can enroll you at 150 % of your base pay to help create a digital employee with your skills – a virtual you ! Your work records are applied automatically as training data , and you may be asked to fine - tune the model . You receive 150 % of your base pay for the 12 months of development , which you receive as your buy out bonus when your employment terminates at the end of those 12 months . You agree that the contents of the model become the intellectual property of the company . Depending on how well your BOGIE image performs , you may be asked to stay on to continue the fine - tuning as an external consultant . Contact CyberHR to find out if you qualify for this exciting program . ” The display was in a modal dialogbox , so Tikaani had to reply “I’m interested” or “Ask me later” to return to their work . Did the CyberHR AI use emotion - sensing algorithms [ 125 ] to deter - mine that the human may be per - suadable to take the buy - out that will benefit the company ? [ 126 ] . The same generative technology that allowed YPP to predict the hu - man’s preferred JupyterGen imple - mentation environment < 8 > , can be used to create v - Tikaani . Fiction Notes < 24 > After the frustration of having to justify a necessary rewrite , Tikaani was almostly ready to take the buy - out offer . But no . When the work was good , it was still interesting – even though it was lonelier now that Yu had taken the buy - out and had been replaced with v - Yu . Tikaani declined the offer , and went back to coding . Yu had agreed to be replaced by a virtual employee that was genera - tively modeled based on Yu’s work records . < 25 > “Drink chai , ” YPP said . Tikaani glared at the screen . Tikaani is experiencing negative af - fect . < 26 > “Drink chai , YPP repeated , “You are at 46 % . Explanation follows . Having a good day is an employee responsibility . Chai helps . Below 40 % , level - 1 reporting to management is mandated . Required action follows . Drink chai . ” Was that a robot joke ? Tikaani had heard rumors of an experimental emotion module . Just before Yu had retired and been replaced with v - Yu , Yu had suggested that – Drinking chai is required by policy , and is sensed by the AI . < 27 > YPP interrupted Tikaani’s reverie . “Drink chai . You are at 42 % . ” < 28 > Tikaani gulped down a full mouthful of chai , and braced against its metallic aftertaste . Tikaani thought back to the days when chai was just an optional beverage that they drank with Yu’s team during tea - breaks . Now chai had become a mandatory delivery vehicle for the Computer - Human Adaptive Intracellular . The the short - lived CHAI virobots were linked to the cyberHR department through near - field communications . The virobots monitored and corrected employees’ health and psychological engagement , based on a generated target bio - labor profile from a ”learned” dataset of biosignals from employees with demonstrated productivity and sufficient job - tenure . Tikaani prepared for the brief moment of dizziness as the virobots crossed their blood - brain barrier to reach the emotion centers of the limbic system . YPP’s warnings had left Tikaani is a very grim mood . But now , Tikaani felt the Intracellular beginning to activate . Tikaani experienced a familiar calm . Despite the loneliness of the mostly - empty office , it was going to be a good day after all , a very good day . Similarly to policy - based cam - paigns to improve employee en - gagement [ 127 , 128 , 129 ] , the com - pany helps employees to work hap - pily and productively through bio - logical interventions . . . . . . which are highly effective , per - haps benefiting company produc - tivity and perhaps employee men - tal health ? Table 1 : Design Fiction with explanatory notes . 4 . Discussion For brevity , we will link our Discussion points to the fiction by reference to numbered paragraphs - e . g . , ” < 3 > . ” 4 . 1 . Generative AI Applications and Features in Software Engineering Workplaces The ”Drinking Chai” story explored a series of increas - ingly futuristic applications of generative AI . We briefly review them here : • We began with the well - understood domain of generative software translation in paragraphs < 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 > , and we emphasized the need for human - AI partnerships in translation < 10 , 13 , 16 , 20 > [ 28 , 26 , 27 , 130 ] , sometimes guided by the AI’s flagging of low - confidence transla - tions < 10 > [ 26 , 27 ] and by the AI’s recommen - dation of alternate classes and libraries < 10 , 13 > . Applied inflexibly , the principle of generative an - ticipation of the ”best” coding usages will lead to trouble in paragraphs < 20 - 22 > . • We also included currently - available capabilities to generate documentation for the generated and modified code , as has been done in limited ways for source code < 18 > [ 40 , 8 ] and also for certain sub - genres of journalism ( e . g . , [ 131 ] ) . • We proposed capabilities for the human to con - trol , steer , and tune specific aspects of the gen - erative processes and outcomes < 5 , 7 > [ 115 , 22 , 132 ] . • We included GUI style transfer as a way of re - fining the generic translations < 6 > [ 133 ] . • We proposed a more futuristic capability to parse a specification document into an architecture plan , and then into a high - level class structure < 3 > with necessary human guidance < 5 , 7 > . • Further into the future , we proposed that a gener - ative assistant could learn the work - practices of its human partner , and could save the hu - man’s effort by suggesting and then implement - ing the anticipated ”next steps” < 8 , 9 , 17 > . • More controversially , we considered that organi - zations could develop virtual versions of par - ticular employees through ”learning” their in - dividual work - practices and then implementing those patterns into a virtual replacement for the employee < 23 , 24 , 26 > . We acknowledge that this idea is futuristic . GANs and related algorithms re - quire large amounts of data . While organizations may be able to use existing generative algorithms for the general case of human actions , further research will be required to specialize these pat - terns to an individual human’s pattern through a smaller set of personal data . We leave open the question of whether this would be a desirable outcome . • Again controversially , we considered that orga - nizations might use generative technologies to ”learn” a ”best” set of employee attributes , and might seek to impose those attributes on less - compliant employees < 28 > . In the preceding discussion , we listed an escalating series of generative features , and we provided evidence ( where it exists ) that current research may be trending toward those features . It may be useful to address the plausibility of the concept of virobots to influence em - ployees’ emotions < 26 , 28 > . While the control aspects are futuristic , we note that in - dwelling digital devices have been part human medical audiology , endocrinology , and neurology for at least a decade [ 134 ] , now as part of a medical approach to Internet of Things [ 135 ] with concomitant privacy and security risks [ 136 , 137 ] . Some of these devices are already being used to modify the patient’s brain state [ 138 , 139 ] . In the commercial space , Applied Digital company’s Verichip is marketed as a sub - dural injection of an RFID tag for building access [ 140 ] . Further , we note that organizations have for years played white noise [ 141 ] or curated music [ 142 , 143 , 144 , 141 ] to affect employees’ mental status for specific organi - zational purposes such as enhanced concentration [ 143 ] , job - engagement [ 142 ] , and even reduction in costly em - ployee - controlled overtime hours [ 144 ] . Thus , employers’ interests in affecting employee mental state are already part of conventional office technologies , and implantable digital devices are already a medical and industrial reality , as is the use of signals from these devices to modify a person’s internal milieu . The only questions that sep - arate the existing state - of - the - art technologies and our paragraphs < 26 , 28 > are : What kinds of psychological modifications might be implemented in the future ? and How would they be ”delivered ? ” and Who controls those modifications ? and of course Is this a desirable future ? 4 . 2 . Value Tensions In keeping with theory and practice of design fictions [ 83 , 64 , 107 , 91 ] and feminist technoscience [ 109 , 110 , 108 , 111 ] , we hoped to raise questions of personal , organiza - tional , and societal values through our fiction . Our use of the principle of strategic ambiguity [ 103 , 106 , 70 ] helps to highlight some of the tensions : • What are the trade - offs of panoptic [ 145 , 146 ] surveillance on employees’ work - practices to achieve organizational goals of productivity < 8 , 10 , 13 , 17 , 20 - 22 > ? Can we distinguish between generative assistance and generative intrusion ? • When should work be governed by choice vs . organizationally - determined ”best” practices < 20 - 22 > ? How can we balance between ”norms” and individual and group innovations < 28 > ? • If AI agents serve as ”teammates” [ 47 ] , then what are the appropriate human - AI collaboration dy - namics [ 42 , 41 , 43 , 44 , 45 ] ? Should they assist < 1 , 3 , 6 - 10 > , advise < 13 , 17 > , monitor < 21 > , and / or sanction employees < 21 , 26 - 28 > ? How do we ad - judicate competing claims about replacing human employees by digital employees < 23 - 24 > ? • Who should own the intellectual property rights of the data used to model the digital em - ployee < 23 > ? • Is Tikaani’s team - lead human or algorith - mic < 21 > ? Managers often interpret , modify , and implement organizational policies to their em - ployees . How would that managerial function be different if an algorithm were to operationalize those policies without human considerations ? • Why is Tikaani so concerned with loneliness < 1 , 6 , 28 > ? We hope that these tensions will help us to ”stay with the trouble” [ 70 , 112 , 108 ] about how generative AI might affect employees and organizations , and under whose guidance . 5 . Conclusion We have applied design fictions as a research method [ 16 , 17 ] to develop conjectures about possible futures of gen - erative AI features and applications , and to raise values - based questions about those possible futures . It is fair to ask , ”what did we learn from this research method ? ” In the Discussion , we explored two topics . We considered current generative AI approaches , and we projected them into possible futures . Gen - erative software translation and generative documen - tation are current capabilities [ 28 , 26 , 27 , 130 , 40 , 8 , 131 ] . Further , we note that there is already re - search under way to provide finer controls over gen - erative algorithms citelouie2020novice , louie2020cococo , zhou2020generative - although there is much work yet to be done . We used those concepts as ”starting points , ” to explore more futuristic ideas . If multiple generative AI applications predict the ”next token” in a sequence of tokens , then we speculated about the nature of possible future tokens , and what those to - kens might be used for . We considered what might be possible - for good or ill - if human actions were treated as be tokens . We were then able to imagine helpful sce - narios , in which an AI could beneficially anticipate the next human action , and could prepare for that action . We also imagined what might be harmful scenarios , in which a human actor might be replaced by a token - based model trained on that person’s history of actions . Finally , based in feminist technoscience [ 109 , 110 , 108 , 111 ] and value sensitive design [ 147 ] , we explored im - plicit values , and the likelihood of value tensions among diverse stakeholders in each of these possible futures . Despite the design fiction tradition of publishing a fiction without empirical data [ 65 , 81 , 86 , 71 , 126 , 87 , 66 ] , we want to broaden the conversation . Our next steps will involve participatory design fiction methods‘ [ 148 , 149 , 150 , 89 , 80 ] to make the work more polyvocal [ 101 ] and more reflective of our technical community’s diverse opinions and aspirations .
