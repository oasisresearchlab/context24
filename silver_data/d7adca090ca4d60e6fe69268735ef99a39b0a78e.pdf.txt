Despite the plethora of studies focusing on the interaction of cells with micrometer and submicro geometrical features , limited information is available on the response of cells to substrates with a quasi - regular distribution of nanoscopic pores . Here , the behavior of four di ﬀ erent cell types is analyzed on two mesoporous ( MeP ) silicon substrates , with an average pore size of ∼ 5 ( MeP1 ) and ∼ 20 nm ( MeP2 ) , respectively . On both MeP substrates , cells are observed to spread and adhere in a larger number as compared to ﬂ at silicon wafers . At all considered time points , the surface density of the adhering cells n d is larger on the PSi substrate with the smaller average pore size ( MeP1 ) . At 60 h , n d is from ∼ 1 . 5 to 5 times larger on MeP1 than on MeP2 substrates , depending on the cell type . The higher rates of proliferation are observed for the two neuronal cell types , the mouse neuroblastoma cells ( N2A ) and the immortalized human cortical neuronal cells ( HCN1A ) . It is speculated that the higher adhesion on MeP1 could be attributed to a preferential matching of the substrate topography with the recently observed multiscale molecular architecture of focal adhesions . These results have implications in the rational development of PSi substrates for supporting cell adhesion and controlling drug release in implants and sca ﬀ olds for tissue engineering applications .

INTRODUCTION The growing interest in porous silicon ( PSi ) for several biomedical applications is justi ﬁ ed by its distinctive advantages over other more traditional materials , such as polymers . PSi can be produced using top - down and quite inexpensive fabrication strategies . 1 In addition , robust protocols are available for its surface modi ﬁ cation with a variety of functional groups and biomolecules . 2 , 3 Also , the pore size , pitch , and shape ( pore geometry ) can be accurately tuned , during the fabrication process , by judiciously choosing parameters such as the etching time , current intensity , active etchant concentration , temper - ature and silicon doping . 1 According to the IUPAC de ﬁ nition , surfaces with a pore size smaller than 2 nm are referred to as microporous ; whereas mesoporous PSi ( MeP ) exhibits pores with an average size ranging between 2 and 50 nm ; and , eventually , for pores larger than 50 nm , the term macroporous PSi ( MaP ) is used . Di ﬀ erently from bulk silicon , PSi is biodegradable under physiological conditions and it dissolves progressively into nontoxic silicic acid . The dissolution rate is dependent on the pore geometry and surface modi ﬁ cation , and it grows as the pore size increases . 4 Several studies have demonstrated the biocompatibility of PSi under di ﬀ erent conditions . 5 − 8 In addition to this , PSi o ﬀ ers very interesting photoluminescence properties which are dependent on pore geometry and disappear for pores larger than a few tens of nanometers . 9 , 10 For all this , PSi has been proposed and is currently used for the fabrication of diverse micro - and nanodevices of interest to the biomedical community . Microchips made out of PSi for the controlled release of drugs were already demonstrated in the ' 90s , 11 and thereafter by several researchers . 12 , 13 With the advent of more sophisticated miniaturization techniques , PSi nanoparticles have been fabricated and used for the systemic administration of therapeutic and imaging agents . 14 − 16 Because of its inherent optical properties , biosensors and bio - optoelectronic devices are also generated out of PSi . 17 MiP Received : January 16 , 2012 Accepted : May 14 , 2012 Published : May 14 , 2012 Research Article www . acsami . org © 2012 American Chemical Society 2903 dx . doi . org / 10 . 1021 / am300519a | ACS Appl . Mater . Interfaces 2012 , 4 , 2903 − 2911 and MeP substrates have been shown to be extremely promising in developing new plasma fractionation techniques for proteomic analysis . 18 , 19 PSi - based sca ﬀ olds for orthopedic implants 20 and for controlling the adhesion and proliferation of di ﬀ erent cell types , including neurons 21 and hepatocytes , 22 have been proposed too . Eye implants for the controlled and long - term release of drugs within the ocular bulb have also been reported . 23 Substrate topography has been known for a long time to a ﬀ ect crucial cell functions , such as adhesion , proliferation , migration and di ﬀ erentiation . 24 This has been extensively characterized on di ﬀ erent materials and on substrates exhibiting diverse topographical features , such as pits , holes , ridges , at the micrometer and submicrometer scale ( > 100 nm ) . 25 − 29 Despite all this , most of the studies on PSi have focused on the e ﬀ ect of surface chemistries on cell adhesion and proliferation . 21 , 22 , 30 , 31 Recently , a hand - full of manuscripts have started interrogating on how pore geometry could a ﬀ ect the cellular response . In Sapelkin et al . , rat hippocampal neurons were observed to preferentially adhere on MaP surfaces , with a pore size ranging between 50 and 100 nm , rather than on ﬂ at silicon surfaces . 32 A broader range of pore sizes was considered in Khung et al . , where neuroblastoma cells ( SK - N - SH ) were cultured over continuous porous gradient substrates spanning across the MeP and MaP regimes . 33 It was shown that substrates with an average pore sizes in the few hundreds of nanometers restrict cell proliferation and adhesion within the ﬁ rst 24 h . This was con ﬁ rmed in a more recent study , with osteoblasts , cultured over substrates with pore sizes of 100 , 300 , and 500 nm . 34 In this manuscript , the adhesive behavior of four distinct cell types is analyzed up to 60 h post seeding on oxidized PSi substrates presenting a pore size ranging between ∼ 5 and 20 nm . This indeed is the more relevant pore size for biomedical applications pertaining to the in vivo controlled delivery of drugs from PSi implants and the in vitro harvesting of low molecular weight proteins from plasma . The four cell types are mouse 3T3 ﬁ broblasts and human vascular endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) , often used as reference cells in biocompatibility and proliferation studies ; mouse neuroblastoma cells ( N2A ) and immortalized human cortical neuronal cells ( HCN1A ) , which are relevant for neurological applications and are characterized by low proliferation rates . Using silicon anodization , two classes of PSi substrates are fabricated within the MeP regime : MeP1 with a pore size of ∼ 5 nm and MeP2 with a pore size of ∼ 20 nm . After a through characterization of the silicon substrates , the distinctive cell adhesion behavior is documented using confocal and electron microscopy . The number density of adhering cells over the two PSi substrates and the ﬂ at unetched silicon , used as a control , is quanti ﬁ ed at the di ﬀ erent time points and compared across the di ﬀ erent cells lines . 2 . MATERIALS AND METHODS 2 . 1 . Fabrication and Characterization of the PSi Substrates . A boron - doped , p type ( 100 ) silicon wafer ( resistivity 5 − 10 Ω / cm ) was used as a substrate . The silicon wafer was cleaned with acetone and ethanol to remove possible contaminants and then etched with a 4 % wet HF ( by Carlo Erba ) solution . The wafer was rinsed with water and dried with N 2 . PSi substrates with a pore diameter lower or equal to 10 nm were obtained by Si anodization using an electrolyte mixture of HF , D . I . water , and ethanol ( by Sigma - Aldrich ) ( 1 : 1 : 2 , v / v / v ) . A constant current density of 20 mA / cm 2 for 5 min at 25 ° C was applied . PSi substrates with a pore diameter larger than 10 and lower than 50 nm were obtained setting a constant current density of 4 mA / cm 2 for 5 min at 25 ° C . An electrolyte mixture of HF , D . I . water , and methanol ( by Sigma - Aldrich ) ( 5 : 3 : 2 , v / v / v ) was used . The samples were ﬁ nally rinsed in D . I . water , ethanol , and pentane with 4 min steps . The PSi substrates were ﬁ nally oxidized in oven at 200 ° C for 2 h . The photoluminescence properties of the PSi substrate was directly veri ﬁ ed using an ultraviolet lamp ( from Spectroline ) , in the long wave ultraviolet limit ( 365 nm ) . The lamp was positioned at 25 cm from the sample , a distance that guarantees a typical peak intensity density of 1000 μ m W / cm 2 . The UV illumination was maintained for 10 s , and the samples were photographed with a commercial camera ( Canon ) setting 2 s integration time . Surface hydrophilicity of the samples was determined by measuring the water contact angle with one drop of about 5 μ L of D . I . water using an automatic contact angle meter ( KSV CAM 101 , KSV INSTRUMENTS LTD , Helsinki , Finland ) at room temperature . Four measurements were performed on each substrate to evaluate the average contact angle θ , at 5 s . 2 . 2 . Cell Culture and Staining . The four cell lines used , namely primary human endothelial ( HUVEC - C ) , mouse mesenchymal normal ( NIH - 3T3 ) , mouse neuroblastoma ( Neuro - 2a , N2A ) and human cortical neuron cell line ( HCN - 1A ) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC ) . The HUVECs were cultured in M199 medium containing 20 % newborn calf serum ( NCS , GIBCO - BRL ) , 5 % human serum ( Gemini Bio - Products , Inc . ) , 50 mg / mL ascorbic acid , 1 . 6 mmol / L L - glutamine , 5 mg / mL bovine brain extract ( Clonetec Corp ) , 7 . 5 mg / mL endothelial growth supplement ( Sigma ) , 100 U / mL penicillin , 100 mg / mL streptomycin , and 10 U / mL heparin . HUVECs at the third to ﬁ fth passage were used for all experiments . The 3T3 , N2A and HCN - 1A cells were cultured in Dulbecco ’ s Modi ﬁ ed Eagle ’ s Medium ( DMEM ) with high glucose and GlutaMAXTM - I ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , California ) , supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( Invitrogen ) , penicillin G ( 100 U / ml ) and streptomycin sulfate ( 100 mg / mL ) ( Invitrogen ) . PSi wafer specimens ( 15 × 15 mm approximately ) were treated under UV light overnight for sterilization , then they were individually placed into single wells of a 6 - well plate ( Corning Incorporated ) . The wafer specimens were washed with phosphate - bu ﬀ ered saline solution ( PBS , Invitrogen ) . The cells were ﬁ nally seeded in complete cell culture medium and incubated for 24 , 36 , 48 , and 60 h , at 37 ° C in a humidi ﬁ ed 5 % CO 2 / air atmosphere . After incubation , the cell culture medium was removed and the cells were washed twice in PBS and ﬁ xed with BD Cyto ﬁ x ( BD Biosciences ) . 100 μ L of Cyto ﬁ x were put on each sample and were incubated in dark for 30 min at 4 ° C . The cells were washed twice with Cytoperm ( a permeabilization solution , BD Biosciences ) . All cells ﬁ xed upon the Si substrates were labeled with 100 μ L DAPI ( 40 , 6 - Diamidino - 2 - phenylindole , SigmaeAldrich ) solution for 30 min at 4 ° C . Finally , the DAPI solution was removed and each sample was washed with PBS . The total number of cells n tot initially deposited in each well for incubation was 3 . 0 × 10 4 , 1 . 5 × 10 4 , 5 . 0 × 10 5 , and 1 . 0 × 10 4 for the mouse 3T3 ﬁ broblasts , the HUVECs , the N2A and the HCN - 1A experiments , respectively . The cells were subcon ﬂ uent throughout the duration of the experiment . Note that , although the number of originally seeded cells varies with the cell line , the area covered by the cells is smaller than about 1 % , at time zero , and well below 80 % , at 60 h post incubation . Therefore , the e ﬀ ect of the originally seeded number of cells on their viability and proliferation can be neglected . Cells were washed twice in PBS and permeabilized with 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 ( SIGMA Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) for 15 min at room temperature . Then , cells were washed again twice in PBS , labeled with Vinculin primary antibody ( Abcam ) for 30 min at 4 ° C and a secondary antibody ( Alexa Fluor 488 chicken antimouse from Invitrogen ) was added . After 40 min of incubation , the cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated with Alexa Fluor 635 phalloidin ( Invitrogen ) . The samples were washed twice with PBS . After this , cells were labeled with 100 μ L of DAPI solution ( Sigma Aldrich ) 30 min at 4 ° C . And ﬁ nally , each sample was washed three times with PBS . 2 . 3 . Cell Microscopy and Counting . An inverted Leica TCS - SP2 laser scanning confocal microscopy system was used to image cells ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces Research Article dx . doi . org / 10 . 1021 / am300519a | ACS Appl . Mater . Interfaces 2012 , 4 , 2903 − 2911 2904 adhering on the substrates . Confocal images of blue ( DAPI ) ﬂ uorescence were collected using a 405 nm excitation line and a 10 × dry objective , so that cells with a characteristic size of a few micrometers could be clearly observed . The number of cells adhering to the substrate within the region of interest at di ﬀ erent roughness and time steps was measured . The cells were analyzed over time after 24 , 36 , 48 , and 60 h in culture . The number of adhering cells ( n ) was normalized with respect to the total number of cells initially deposited in each well ( n tot ) and divided by the well area to derive the surface density of adhering cells as n d = n / ( n tot A ) with A ≈ 707 mm 2 . The ﬂ uorescence distribution of actin and vinculin was analyzed for cells deposited on ﬂ at and PSi substrates using an inverted Nikon TE2000 - C1 confocal microscope . All images were acquired using a 60 × / 1 . 49 NA TIRF oil immersion objective . The pinhole ( 30 μ m ) was maintained throughout each experiment , thus yielding the maximum confocality for the system . Sample ﬂ uorophores were excited using a 488 nm Ar Laser ( for vinculin ) and a 543 nm HeNe laser ( for actin ) . The images were digitized into 512 × 512 pixels and conveyed to a computer for storage . 2 . 4 . SEM Characterization of the PSi Substrates and Cells . SEM images of the wafers were captured using a Dual Beam ( SEM - FIB ) - FEI Nova 600 NanoLab system . During acquisition , the beam energy and the corresponding electron current were ﬁ xed to 15 keV and 0 . 14 nA , respectively . The PSi morphology was imaged by employing the mode 2 con ﬁ guration , whereby images can be magni ﬁ ed over 2500 × 10 3 times and ultrahigh resolution can be achieved . For cell characterization , the Si specimens were positioned inside each well in a 6 well micro plate . The cells were cultured for 48 h using normal conditions , as described above . The medium was removed by suction . The cells were then washed twice with PBS bu ﬀ er and ﬁ xed with 4 % of paraphormaldehyde for 30 min at 4 ° C . The samples were washed twice with 0 , 1 M Cacodylate Bu ﬀ er with 10 min wait between each washing . The sample were ﬁ nally dehydrated using alcohol steps 10 min long , with a concentration in D . I . water ranging from 50 to 100 % in volume . Several SEM images of the cells were captured to assess the dependence of cells morphology upon the di ﬀ erent porous substrate . A JEOL JSM - 7500F scanning electron microscope was used for the measurements . During acquisition , the beam energy of 5 keV and corresponding electron current of 0 . 98 pA was used . The surface porosity of the substrates was determined by proper imaging analysis of several SEM micrographs , as described in the Supporting Information . 2 . 5 . Cell Protein Extracts and Western Blot . The expression of vinculin , a major component of adhesion plaques and cell − cell junctions , is markedly up regulated in cells during growth activation , di ﬀ erentiation , motility and cell transformation . Therefore , experi - ments were performed to verify the expression of vinculin in cells growing on ﬂ at and MeP Si substrates . Neuro2a neuroblastoma cells were seeded on the di ﬀ erent substrates and , after 48 h , the total protein was collected and subjected to Western blotting assay . Total protein extracts were obtained as follow : a 5 × 10 5 cell pellet was resuspended in 50 μ L of RIPA bu ﬀ er ( 50 mM Tris - cl pH 7 . 4 ; 150 mM NaCl ; 1 % NP40 ; 0 . 25 % Na - deoxycholate ; 1 mM PMSF ; 1x Roche complete mini protease inhibitor cocktail ; 1x Sigma phosphatase inhibitor 1 cocktail ) and maintained for 20 min on ice with constant rocking . Samples were centrifuged 20 min at 12 , 000 rpm 4 ° C and supernatant was collected in new tubes . Proteins were quanti ﬁ ed by Figure 1 . Fabrication of porous silicon ( PSi ) substrates .

RESULTS 3 . 1 . Fabrication and Characterization of Porous Silicon ( PSi ) Substrates . PSi substrates were generated from a bulk boron - doped p - type ( 100 ) silicon wafer via anodization . 1 The original silicon wafer was placed in a Te ﬂ on electrolytic cell , where a platinum cathode and the silicon wafer ( anode ) are immersed in a hydrogen ﬂ uoride ( HF ) solution ( Figure 1A − C ) . The mechanism for pore formation is schematically reported in Figure . 1D . Substrates with various pore sizes were obtained by tailoring the etching conditions ( Table in Figure . 1E ) , and treating the silicon wafers for 5 min at room temperature ( 25 ° C ) . Mesoporous silicon substrates with an average pore diameter of 5 nm ( MeP1 ) and 20 nm ( MeP2 ) were obtained by applying a constant current density of 20 mA / cm 2 and 4 mA / cm 2 , respectively . This anodization process introduced a thin porous layer over the original ﬂ at Si substrate with a thickness of a few tens of nanometers ( Figure 1F ) . In this work , three substrates are used for the analysis of cell behavior : MeP1 , MeP2 and ﬂ at unetched silicon ( Si ) , as a reference . The surface topography of the three substrates was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) and atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) . Also , photoluminescence was used to con ﬁ rm indirectly the characteristic pore size in the MeP substrates ; and contact angle measurements were employed to quantify the substrate hydrophobicity .

Interfaces 2012 , 4 , 2903 − 2911 2906 together with a power spectrum analysis of the surface pro ﬁ le . Distinctive geometrical features can be easily depicted when comparing the three substrates ( Figure 2A ) : the Si substrate appears as almost uniformly ﬂ at ; the MeP1 and MeP2 substrates are quite uniformly porosi ﬁ ed with a characteristic pore size in the few nanometers and few tens of nanometers , respectively . Such di ﬀ erences are also re ﬂ ected by the surface AFM pro ﬁ les ( Figure . 2B ) and by the surface power spectra ( Figure 2C ) . In particular , the surface roughness R a is low for all three substrates being equal to 0 . 1 , ∼ 1 , and ∼ 1 . 3 nm for the Si , MeP1 , and MeP2 substrates , respectively . On the other hand , larger di ﬀ erences arise for the surface fractal dimension D , when comparing Si and MeP2 ( D = 2 . 35 and 2 . 39 , respectively ) with the MeP1 substrate ( D = 2 . 81 ) . A detailed analysis of the pore geometry is presented in Figure 2D where the pore size distribution , photoluminescent behavior and surface contact angle are presented for the two PSi substrates . For MeP1 substrates , most of the pores have a size falling in the 5 nm range and no pores larger than 20 nm are detected ; whereas for the MeP2 substrates , most of the pores exhibit a characteristic size ranging between 10 and 20 nm and very few pores are larger than 50 nm ( Figure 2D ) . These pore size distributions are con ﬁ rmed by the photo - luminescence analysis where the silicon substrates are exposed to a UV light ( λ ≈ 365 ) . As expected , 35 the images show a stronger luminescence for the MeP1 as compared to the MeP2 substrates , in that the former have a higher occurrence of pores in the nanometer range ( Figure . 2E ) . Both MeP substrates are originally hydrophobic exhibiting a contact angle of θ ≈ 135 ° , but becomes hydrophilic ( θ ∼ 30 ° ) upon oxidation ( Figure . 2F ) . The ﬂ at Si substrates are hydrophilic with a contact angle θ = 60 ° ( see Figure S1 in the Supporting Information ) . By imaging postprocessing of several SEM micrographs , the surface porosity of the two Si substrates was estimated as the ratio between total area of the pores and the area of the considered region of interest . As shown in the Supporting Information , the surface porosities were 20 . 1 ± 4 % for MeP1 and 25 . 0 ± 6 % for MeP2 . 3 . 2 . Cell Adhesion and Proliferation on Porous Silicon ( PSi ) Substrates . The propensity to adhere and grow of the four cell types was analyzed by incubating them over fragments of silicon substrates ( ∼ 15 × 15 mm ) . Note that none of the Figure 3 .

Interfaces 2012 , 4 , 2903 − 2911 2907 substrates was pretreated to support cell adhesion . At each time point , namely 24 , 36 , 48 , and 60 h , the silicon substrates were ﬁ rst washed to remove loosely adhering and death cells ; then , the remaining cells were ﬁ xed and labeled with DAPI . The cells adhering within a region of interest ( ROI ) of ∼ 1 × 1 mm 2 were counted using ﬂ uorescent microscopy . For each substrate , more than 40 ROIs were considered to provide a meaningful sample size for statistical analysis The number of adhering cells per unit surface normalized by the total number of seeded cells ( i . e . , the cell surface density , n d ) is shown in Figure 3A as a function of time . As expected , the cell surface density n d increases with time . More interestingly , Figure 3A shows that the maximum cell surface density n d occurs over the MeP1 substrates , at all time points and for all cell types . The contribution of the MeP1 substrates in supporting cell adhesion and proliferation is even more evident in the bar chart of Figure 3B , where the ratios between the cell surface densities n d , measured at 60 h , over the MeP1 and Si substrates ( MeP1 / Si ) and the MeP2 and Si substrates ( MeP2 / Si ) are presented . For the ﬁ rst ratio , MeP1 / Si substrate ( dark bars in Figure 3B ) , values larger than 50 are observed for the neuronal N2A cells . These are followed by the mouse 3T3 Figure 4 .

Interfaces 2012 , 4 , 2903 − 2911 2908 ﬁ broblasts , with a ratio larger than 10 ; HUVECs , with a ratio of ∼ 7 ; and by the HCN - 1A cells , with a ratio of ∼ 5 . The MeP2 / Si ratios are smaller but still signi ﬁ cantly larger than unity ( light bars in Figure . 3B ) . Comparing directly the surface density of cells on the two PSi substrates , it appears that cells are from ∼ 1 . 5 to 5 times more numerous on MeP1 , at 60 h . It is here important to recall that human cortical neuronal cells ( HCN - 1A ) proliferate very slowly but , interestingly , they do exhibit a growth rate signi ﬁ cantly larger than zero on MeP1 substrates . This experimental evidence supports the notion that cells preferentially adhere and grow over substrates with nanometer pore size ( MeP1 ) rather than on ﬂ at Si substrates or substrates with a larger pore size ( MeP2 ) . A direct comparison of the adhesion of 3T3 mouse ﬁ broblasts and HUVECs on nominally ﬂ at silicon substrate ( Si ) and glass cell culture dish ( Glass ) has been included in Figure S2 in the Supporting Information . The data show minor di ﬀ erences in terms of the number density of cells adhering over 4 di ﬀ erent times points , namely 24 , 36 , 48 , and 60 h . The surface of the two substrates ( Si and Glass ) has also been characterized using Atomic Force Microscopy and Contact Angle measurements ( see Figure S3 in the Supporting Information ) . These data show that the considered cell lines have fairly similar behaviors on Si and Glass , thus suggesting that the di ﬀ erence observed with the porous substrates is signi ﬁ cant and practically relevant . To gain additional information on the distinctive cell behavior over the three di ﬀ erent substrates , the 3T3 and N2A cells were ﬁ xed and observed with scanning electron and confocal microscopy . SEM and ﬂ uorescent confocal microscopy images for the mouse 3T3 ﬁ broblast cells are given in Figure 4 . Similar images for the N2A cells are presented in Figure S4 in the Supporting Information . On both MeP substrates , the cell body appears elongated with a well spread cytoskeleton and the formation of long protrusions out of the cell membrane ( Figure 4B , D ) . Di ﬀ erently , on the Si substrate , cells appear more rounded with a few short and squat protrusions ( Figure 4B ) . Noticeably , and in accordance with these ﬁ ndings , a similar behavior was observed for stromal cells that , when adhering on mesoporous silicon or polymer ﬁ ber composites , exhibit elongated morphologies . 36 From the SEM images , two important parameters for characterizing the cell morphology can be derived : the cell area A ( in μ m 2 ) , de ﬁ ned as the area covered by the cell projected over the substrate ; the cell shape index ( CSI ) , de ﬁ ned as the ratio between the shorter and the longer axis of the cell . Both parameters , A and CSI , are presented in the bar chart of Figure 4C . For both MeP substrates , no signi ﬁ cant di ﬀ erence is observed in cell adhesion area and morphology , whereas cells on ﬂ at Si substrates are more rounded and less spread . Note that ﬂ at Si substrates showed a slightly larger contact angle as compared to the MeP substrates , which could in part be responsible for the observed lower cell adhesion and spreading . Similar morphological observations can be drawn from the confocal ﬂ uorescent images of Figure 4D . Here , however , additional information can be gained by looking at the actin network ( red labeled ) and the pattern distribution of the vinculin molecules ( green labeled ) . Actin ﬁ laments appear more elongated and aligned along the major axis of the cell on the MeP substrates . Also , vinculin tends to form more distinct and ordered clusters , preferentially expressed at the head of cell membrane protrusions ( Figure . 4D ) . The higher expression levels of vinculin in cells growing on MeP substrates are also con ﬁ rmed by Western blotting analysis : as shown in Figure S5 in the Supporitng Information , the signal given by antivinculin antibody appeared 2 times higher in Neuro2A proliferating on MeP1 substrate , compared to Si and MeP2 . No di ﬀ erence was revealed in beta - III tubulin expression , used as calibrator . Taken together , these results indicate that cells growing on MeP1 substrates can better activate molecular pathways directly related to the active proliferation . It should here be noted that in a biological environment ( pH > 5 . 5 ) , porous silicon is generally biodegradable over time . 43 − 46 The dissolution process is strongly dependent on the porosity of the layer and surface modi ﬁ cation . The substrates used here exhibit a porosity not exceeding 60 % and a protective coating of native silicon dioxide layer ( SiO 2 ) ; and no substrate degradation was observed over the whole period of the experiments ( 60 h ) . 4 . DISCUSSION PSi implants for long - term drug release have been demon - strated for quite a few applications . This includes devices for the release of antibiotics in bone implants , 20 , 37 , 38 for supporting the di ﬀ erentiation and proliferation of stem cells , 23 hepato - cites , 22 and improving the biomechanical connectivity between man - made electrodes and neuronal cells . 21 Drugs and small molecules can be e ﬀ ectively loaded into the porous network of PSi , using di ﬀ erent approaches . 39 , 40 Capillary action is certainly the simplest . In this case , a concentrated solution of the active agent to be loaded is either dropped directly on the PSi layer or the latter is fully immersed in the solution . The pore geometry , as well as the surface chemical modi ﬁ cation , are important determinants in controlling the loading , ﬁ rst , and then the release of the active agent . 41 , 42 Drugs , microbicidal formula - tions , proteins and small molecules are more e ﬀ ectively trapped in pores exhibiting a size smaller than ∼ 10 nm . Indeed , this manuscript focuses on the behavior of cells that would adhere and proliferate over MeP1 ( pore diameters < 10 nm ) and MeP2 ( pore diameters = 10 − 50 nm ) substrates . The results presented clearly support the notion that cells can sense nanoscopic features on PSi substrates down to just a few nanometers ( ∼ 5 nm ) and react di ﬀ erently to distinctive nanotopographical cues . This has been demonstrated for four distinct cell types , namely mouse 3T3 ﬁ broblasts , HUVECs , N2A and HCN - 1A cells . They all manifested a higher adhesion on MeP1 substrates as compared to ﬂ at silicon or MeP2 surfaces , at all the considered time points . The largest enhancement in cell adhesion is observed for the N2A , a murine neuroblastoma cell line , for which 50 times more cells adhered , at 60 h , over the MeP1 substrates . But even the HCN - 1A cells , which are characterized by a very slow proliferation rate , were observed to grow 5 times faster at 60 h . At authors ’ knowledge , such a behavior has never been reported , so far , since studies on cell adhesion over PSi have mostly focused on substrates with larger pores ( > 20 − 30 nm up to a few micrometers ) , showing either a decrease in adhesion ( substrates with 100 − 500 nm pore size ) or similar adhesion ( > 1000 nm ) , with respect to ﬂ at silicon wafers . 32 − 34 It is still not yet clear , however , why cells would preferentially adhere and grow on MeP substrates . Recently , it has been shown that focal adhesions ( FAs ) exhibit a complex multiscale architecture where nanoscopic , doughnut - shaped complexes ( ∼ 25 nm in diameter and spaced at ∼ 45 nm intervals ) are distributed within the adhesion area and are associated to aligned bundles of actin ﬁ laments . 47 Given their characteristic ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces Research Article dx . doi . org / 10 . 1021 / am300519a | ACS Appl . Mater . Interfaces 2012 , 4 , 2903 − 2911 2909 size , these complexes could better conform to clusters of ∼ 5 nm pores over MeP substrates . In other words , it can be speculated that the nanoscopic complexes in FAs would more intimately interact with the porous structure of the MeP substrates . More studies are needed to verify this hypothesis as well as to elucidate the role played by the nanoscopic complexes in FAs . In future works , the attention should focus on the systematic analysis of ( i ) the cytoskeleton organization via ﬂ uorescent confocal microscopy , ( ii ) the architecture of FAs by cryo - electron tomography ; and ( iii ) the dynamics of formation for FXs and FAs . It should also be noted that an accurate dissection of the mechanisms regulating cell interaction with mesoporous structures would require the use of substrates that are transparent to light . Nonetheless , the MeP silicon substrates and the presented results help in shedding new lights on the biophysics of cell adhesion on truly nanoscopic substrates and stimulate additional work on this important subject . 5 . CONCLUSIONS The adhesion of four cell types , mouse 3T3 ﬁ broblasts , HUVECs , N2A and HCN - 1A cells , were monitored up to 60 h on three di ﬀ erent silicon substrates : two PSi substrates , with a pore size falling in the mesoporous regime ( MeP1 : pore size ∼ 5 nm ; MeP2 : pore size ∼ 20 nm ) , obtained via anodization of silicon wafers and a unetched Si substrate . Cells on MeP1 were documented to grow from 5 to 50 times faster as compared to Si substrates , at 60 h . For the MeP2 substrates , the growth rate was still larger than for the Si substrate and ranged between 1 . 5 and 8 , at 60 h . The growth rate was higher for the N2A , a murine neuroblastoma cell line , and smaller for the HCN - 1A , a human neuronal cell line which is known to have a very low duplication rate . A large di ﬀ erence in adhesion between MeP1 and MeP2 was observed , although cell spreading and morphology appeared similar . We speculate that there could be an “ optimal matching ” between the multiscale molecular architecture of focal adhesions and the porous structure of MeP1 substrates that could facilitate adhesion . These results have implications in the rational development of PSi substrates in implants and sca ﬀ olds for the controlled release of drugs , nerve repair , and tissue engineering applications . ■ ASSOCIATED CONTENT * S Supporting Information Additional data on the characterization of the PSi substrates and on cell adhesion , and complementary information to the Materials and Methods section .
