Stress was introduced by Hans Selye as the general adapta - tion syndrome , which is a process under which the body confronts noxious agents . In the face of stress , the ﬁ rst reac - tion of the body is an alarm reaction , and the body prepares itself for “ ﬁ ght or ﬂ ight . ” And the second stage is adaptation of resistance , for the organism cannot sustain this motivated state too long . Finally , “ due to wear and tear , ” the body enters a third stage of exhaustion . Selye ’ s brilliant ideas about stress helped an entirely new ﬁ eld to be forged and attracted thou - sands of researchers to work on the biological mechanism of stress . Stress was later extended to the ﬁ eld of psychology and rede ﬁ ned as the presence of acute or persistent physiological or psychological threats to the organism that result in signif - icant strain on the body ’ s compensatory systems , because anticipated thoughts about the stressful events can also induce stressful reactions . In addition , if the biological threat is easily avoidable , the body will not be stressed . Therefore , stressful reactions depend on the uncertain thought about the stressful events . Lazarus proposed that stress depends on the thoughts and appraisals of the importance of the individual analysis of subjective appraisal of the situation . He distinguished two kinds of appraisals . The ﬁ rst appraisal is automatic , unre ﬂ ective and unconscious , and fast activating , which is related to harm and threat , and induces fearful emotion to motivate avoidance and withdraw . The second is conscious and concerned with coping . In the face of threat , the organ - ism was scared at ﬁ rst and showed fearful emotions . And then to cope with the threats , the organism collects energy in the body trying to “ ﬁ ght or ﬂ ight ” and shows angry emotions . Therefore , fear and anger usually come in a tan - dem at stressful events ; fear is the scariness at the stressful events , and anger is coping with the threats . Lazarus suggested that fear and anger are hard to be detached and are two sides of the same coin . Similar to Selye ’ s three stages of stress , Lazarus suggested another stage of reappraisal after coping with the situation . An individual employs two kinds of reappraisals : problem - focused and emotion - focused . If the organism can cope successfully with the stressful situation , the organism will get positive emotions and be happy . If the organism failed to cope with the situation , the organism would get negative emotions and be sad . Therefore , stressful event - induced emotions will go through a “ fear - anger - joy - sadness ” process , like a rainbow after a storm ( Figure 1 ) . If the organism cannot overcome the stressful events , like chronic stresses , some mental disorders will appear . The relation of theprocesswith theemotionalchanges and mental disorders is shown in Figure 1 . The mechanisms whereby external stressors a ﬀ ect brain function have been the subject of extensive study over the past 60 years . Corticotropin - releasing hormone ( CRH ) , which was named the stress hormone , has become the focus of the study . In both animals and humans , CRH can simulate norepinephrine ( NE ) synthesis and release . The central NE system innervates many brain areas , sym - pathetic nervous systems . CRH release also activates the hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal ( HPA ) axis , which has been widely accepted as one of the central mechanisms involved in stress . The CRH induced release of ACTH ( adrenocorticotropic hormone ) and can in turn alter the HindawiNeural Plasticity Volume 2017 , Article ID 9634501 , 3 pages https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1155 / 2017 / 9634501 function of the neural network by altering building blocks in the networks and by altering the integrative properties , and thus the behavioral or emotional changes . This neural plasticity underlying stress undoubtedly a ﬀ ects the brain function and may prompt functional alternations in mental disorders . Indeed , stress - induced neuroplasticity plays a critical role in almost all of the mental disorders , and stress has become a synonym for diverse terms of negative emotions , such as depression and anxiety . In this special issue , we collected papers on stress - induced neural plasticity and some neurological diseases . These reviews and experimental papers present the evidence that stress indeed a ﬀ ects long - term synaptic changes and induces many diseases such as depression and chronic pain . Inthereviewpaper “ Safety NeedsMediateStressfulEvents Induced Mental Disorders , ” Z . Zheng et al . reviewed recent papers about stress and proposed a new theory about human needs , which challenged the cornerstone theory of Maslow ’ s famoustheoryofhierarchy ofneeds : safetyneedscome second to physiological needs . In this article , they propose that safety needs are more important and basic than physiological needs . Theyalsoprobed intotheneuralbasis ofthestresssystemtobe LC / NE system , and HPA system , which can be regarded as a “ safety circuitry , ” whose major behavior function is “ ﬁ ght or ﬂ ight ” and “ fear and anger ” emotions . In the experimental paper “ Shuyu Capsules Relieve Pre - menstrual Syndrome Depression by Reducing 5 - HT 3A R and 5 - HT 3B R Expression in the Rat Brain , ” F . Li et al . reported a special treatment for the premenstrual depres - sion . In this paper , the author reported that the premen - strual syndrome depression is characterized by changes in the subtypes of 5 - HT receptors , especially the 5 - HT 3 receptors . In a special kind of rat depression model , they found that a kind of Chinese herb named Shuyu capsule can a ﬀ ect the expression levels of these receptors and can possibly be used to treat depression . In the experimental paper “ ATP Induces Disruption of Tight Junction Proteins via IL - 1 Beta - Dependent MMP - 9 Activation of Human Blood - Brain Barrier In Vitro , ” F . Yang et al . reported that ATP released after blood - brain barrier impairments under brain traumatic stress a ﬀ ected P 2 X 7 receptors and induced neural plasticity in the brain . In the experimental paper “ Activation of Sphingosine 1 - Phosphate Receptor 1 Enhances Hippocampus Neurogenesis in a Rat Model of Traumatic Brain Injury : An Involvement of MEK / Erk Signaling Pathway , ” Y . Ye et al . reported MEK / ERK signaling pathway in the neural plasticity under traumatic events . In the review paper “ The Role of Stress Regulation on Neural Plasticity in Pain Chroni ﬁ cation , ” the authors X . Li and L . Hu reviewed papers about stress and reported two pathways for stress : the faster pathway is the catecholamine , including norepinephrine and dopamine , priming the body into a kind of “ ﬁ ght or ﬂ ight ” state , and the slower process , including HPA changes . The neural plasticity under stress might be the substrate for chronic pain . In the experimental paper “ Pro ﬁ ling Proteins in the Hypothalamus and Hippocampus of a Rat Model of Pre - menstrual Syndrome Irritability , ” M . Qiao et al . reported molecular changes in the hypothalamus and hippocampus under premenstrual depression , including Ulip2 , tubulin , actin , interleukin , increased Kapp - beta binding motif phos - phoprotein , and many other proteins . This paper will help understand the pathogenesis of premenstrual depression . In the experimental paper “ Neuroplastic Correlates in the mPFC Underlying the Impairment of Stress - Coping Ability and Cognitive Flexibility in Adult Rats Exposed to Chronic Mild Stress during Adolescence , ” Y . Zhang et al . reported very interesting studies about in ﬂ uences of chronic mild stress in adolescence on cognition emotion and behavior and neurochemistry changes in the prefrontal cortex and suggested that the chronic stress - induced epigenetic changes might be the reason for the correlation between the emotional changes and neurochemistry changes . In the experimental paper “ A Combined Water Extract of Frankincense and Myrrh Alleviates Neuropathic Pain in Mice via Modulation of TRPV1 , ” D . Hu et al . reported some changes in TRPV1 channels under chronic pain , and they Succeed Coping Fear Stressfulevents ( anger ) Phobia Happiness FailureSadness Repeated failure HelplessnessDepression ( a ) Stressful events Calm F e a r J o y S a d n e s s M i s s i n g W o r r y P a n i c A n g e r ( b ) Figure 1 : Stress - induced emotion ﬂ ow and mental disorders . ( a ) At stressful events or threatening events , an organism will ﬁ rst be scared with the fear emotion . And to cope with the stressful events , the organism collects energy in the body to try to “ ﬁ ght or ﬂ ight ” with angry emotions . Fear is the scariness at the stressful events , and anger is coping with the stressful events . If the organism can cope successfully with the stressful situation , the organism will reappraise the situation and get positive emotions and be happy . If the organism failed to cope with the situation , the organism would get negative emotions and be sad . Stress - fear - response ( anger ) - consequences ( happiness or sadness ) constitute the emotion ﬂ ow in our lives . ( b ) The emotion ﬂ ow at stressful events is like a rainbow after a storm . 2 Neural Plasticity introduced a kind of Chinese herb which helps recovery from the chronic pain by modulation of TRPV1 channels . In the experimental paper “ Pathological Role of Peptidyl - Prolyl Isomerase Pin1 in the Disruption of Synaptic Plasticity in Alzheimer ’ s Disease , ” L . Xu et al . reported stress - induced loss of Pin1 protein activity enhances ubiquitin , which in turn induced synaptic loss and leads to Alzheimer ’ s disease . Collectively , these studies demonstrate that stress can induce many critical changes in the neural plasticity underly - ing many neurological diseases . We hope that this special issue will stimulate interests in the ﬁ eld of mechanisms of stress - inducing synaptic disorder and will help achieve a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanism of stress - induced disorders .
