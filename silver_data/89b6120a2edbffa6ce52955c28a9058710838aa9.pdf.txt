However , few studies have investigated the effect of exercise conducted in natural settings . Here , in a crossover randomized controlled trial , we investigated the effect of a common daily activity , stair - climbing , on creative thinking . As experimental intervention , subjects were asked to walk downstairs from the fourth to the ﬁrst ﬂoor and back at their usual pace . As control intervention , they walked the same path but using the elevator instead . Compared to using the elevator , stair - climbing enhanced subsequent divergent but not convergent thinking in that it increased originality on the Alternate Use Test ( d = 0 . 486 ) . Subjects on average generated 61 % more original uses after stair - climbing . This is the ﬁrst study to investigate the effect of stair - climbing on creative thinking . Our ﬁndings suggest that stair - climbing may be a useful strategy for enhancing divergent thinking in everyday life . Keywords : acute aerobic exercise , stair - climbing , creativity , divergent thinking , alternate use test , insight problem - solving INTRODUCTION Creativity or creative thinking , a high - level cognitive function , is the key to invention and innovation in many ﬁelds of human society , including but not limited to science , technology , industry , business , education , and art ( Hennessey and Amabile , 2010 ; Sternberg and Kaufman , 2018 ) . The development of eﬀective tools to evaluate and strategies to enhance creative thinking , therefore , has attracted much attention in the past decades ( Guilford , 1967b ; Hennessey and Amabile , 2010 ; Sternberg and Kaufman , 2018 ) . Creative thinking comprises two fundamental processes : divergent and convergent thinking . Whereas the former involves stretching beyond existing solutions to generate multiple , novel ones , the latter involves approaching a single correct , objective - appropriate solution ( Guilford , 1967a ) . It has been shown that performance on tests of divergent and convergent thinking predicts creative potential and achievement in real - life as well as creativity evaluated by others ( Cropley , 2000 ; Kim , 2008 ; Runco et al . , 2010 ; Gralewski and Karwowski , 2019 ) . A recent , timely systematic review concluded that a single bout of aerobic exercise may enhance creative thinking ( in particular divergent thinking , Aga et al . , 2021 ) . In the reviewed studies , divergent thinking was typically evaluated with the original or adapted versions of the Alternate Uses Test ( AUT , Guilford , 1960 ; Torrance , 1966 ) . In this test , subjects have to write down as many as possible unusual uses of common objects , such as “bricks . ” The number of generated uses ( known as ﬂuency ) , the number of conceptual categories the generated uses are from ( ﬂexibility ) , and Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 1 January 2022 | Volume 15 | Article 834097 fnbeh - 15 - 834097 January 24 , 2022 Time : 14 : 55 # 2 Matsumoto et al . Stair - Climbing Divergent and Convergent Thinking the rareness of the uses ( originality ) are commonly employed as indicators of divergent thinking ( Runco and Acar , 2012 ; Reiter - Palmon et al . , 2019 ) . Studies conducted in the laboratory have reported that aerobic workout or dance for approximately 20 min ( Steinberg et al . , 1997 ) , walking on a treadmill for 4 min at a self - selected pace ( Oppezzo and Schwartz , 2014 ) or 44 min at vigorous - intensity ( Netz et al . , 2007 ) , or cycling on an ergometer for 15 min at roughly light to moderate intensity ( Aga et al . , 2021 ) enhanced one or multiple indicators of divergent thinking . Convergent thinking , in contrast , was unaﬀected or uninvestigated in these studies . Despite these encouraging ﬁndings , whether aerobic exercise commonly conducted in everyday life enhances creative thinking remains unclear . To our knowledge , only two studies have investigated the eﬀect of acute aerobic exercise conducted in natural , real - life settings . One study investigated the eﬀect of walking through a university campus ( Oppezzo and Schwartz , 2014 ) , and the other the eﬀect of a 45 - min physical education class featuring aerobic games ( Román et al . , 2018 ) , both of which reported enhanced divergent thinking after the intervention . Neither studies , however , evaluated convergent thinking . In the present study , therefore , we aimed to advance our understanding of the impact of aerobic exercise conducted in everyday life on both divergent and convergent thinking , by focusing on a common physical activity , stair - climbing . Climbing stairs at comfortable or fast paces and with or without carrying groceries or other loads , has been a recommended physical activity in many governmental guidelines , such as those of the United States ( US Department of Health and Human Services , 2018 ) and Japan ( Japanese Ministry of Health Labour and Welfare [ JMHLW ] , 2013 ) . Based on previous reports that stepping over obstacles and precision stepping activate the prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) , a primary neural substrate of divergent thinking , cognitive ﬂexibility , and executive functions in general ( Yuan and Raz , 2014 ; Dajani and Uddin , 2015 ; Wu et al . , 2015 ) , we hypothesized that a brief stair - climbing intervention enhances divergent and convergent thinking . MATERIALS AND METHODS Participants The study was approved by the authors’ Institutional Review Board and carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki . All subjects provided written informed consent . The study was also preregistered on the University hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trial Registry ( UMIN - CTR ) . Using data from Oppezzo and Schwartz ( Oppezzo and Schwartz , 2014 ) that reported an eﬀect size of d = 0 . 70 ( Experiment 1 , Walking versus Siting within - subjects ) , we estimated that to detect such an eﬀect size with power = 0 . 8 , alpha = 0 . 05 , two - sided , 19 subjects were necessary . Considering dropout cases , we recruited 22 subjects ( 12 males , 10 females , including 19 medical undergraduates and three graduate students ; age : 21 . 36 ± 1 . 33 years ) . The inclusion criterion was being in their twenties . The exclusion criteria were reporting any current psychiatric disorders ( or currently psychiatric examinations ) and having participated our previous studies of creative thinking . Design and Procedure Before the laboratory visit , subjects received instructions to get enough sleep and refrain from doing intense physical activities and from smoking and consuming drinks with caﬀeine for at least 2 h before coming to the laboratory . They were also asked to change the experimental schedule if they were sick . Upon arriving , subjects ﬁrst provided written informed consent after receiving a detailed description of the study . They then ﬁlled out questionnaires and answered their demographic information together with a few questions to check if they have followed the above instructions . Subjects also indicated their baseline mood using the Positive and Negative Aﬀect Schedule [ PANAS , Watson et al . , 1988 ] . The study was a crossover randomized controlled trial with a posttest comparison design ( Figure 1 ) . Subjects were assigned to receive a brief stair - climbing and control intervention in a counter balanced order and immediately after each intervention they conducted tests of creative thinking . The trial was repeated on two separate days to investigate the eﬀect on divergent and convergent thinking , respectively . The order of the divergent and convergent thinking tests was also randomized . Statistical comparisons showed that subjects reported similar baseline positive aﬀect ( paired t - test , t = − 0 . 697 , p = 0 . 493 ) and negative FIGURE 1 | Schematic illustration of the procedure . Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 2 January 2022 | Volume 15 | Article 834097 fnbeh - 15 - 834097 January 24 , 2022 Time : 14 : 55 # 3 Matsumoto et al . Stair - Climbing Divergent and Convergent Thinking aﬀect ( Wilcoxon signed - rank test , Z = − 1 . 267 , p = 0 . 205 ) on the two test days , suggesting that the randomization was appropriate . During both interventions , subjects wore an Apple Watch ( Series 4 , Apple Inc . ) to measure their heart rate and time taken to ﬁnish the intervention . The accuracy of Apple Watch for the measurement of heart rate has been established ( Wang et al . , 2017 ) . Immediately after each intervention , subjects also indicated their current mood on a visual analog scale in terms of pleasure , relaxation , and vigor ( Aga et al . , 2021 ) . As a washout period , after the ﬁrst phase of intervention and creative thinking test , subjects rested for 5 min . After ﬁnishing the last creative test on the second test day ( i . e . , at the end of the experiment ) , subjects also ﬁlled out the International Physical Activity Questionnaire ( IPAQ ) to report their levels of vigorous physical activity , moderate physical activity , and walking in the past 7 days . Intervention For the stair - climbing intervention , starting from the laboratory room on the fourth ﬂoor , subjects were asked to walk downstairs to the ﬁrst ﬂoor and back after approaching but without stepping out of the entrance of the building . A schematic illustration of this round - trip path and the layout of the ﬁrst and fourth ﬂoors is shown in Supplementary Figure 1 . One ﬂight had 21 stairs in between . For the control intervention , they were asked to walk the same path but using the elevator instead . Subjects were asked to walk at their usual pace for both interventions . They were also asked to remain quiet and not to speak with anyone they might encounter throughout the interventions . The rationale of selecting this intensity of exercise intervention ( i . e . , walking downstairs of three ﬂights and then back ) was three - fold . Firstly , this intensity ( in Metabolic equivalents ) was roughly equal to that of treadmill walking for 4 min as used in Oppezzo and Schwartz ( Oppezzo and Schwartz , 2014 ) , as estimated based on our pilot testing . Secondly , we could also have set the walking distance to ﬁve ﬂights since we also had laboratory rooms on the sixth ﬂoor ; however , in our pilot testing , subjects felt somewhat tired and short of breath , which did not allow us to start the creative thinking tests immediately after the intervention . Thirdly , based on our pilot survey with staﬀs and students in our department , most people tended to use stairs for two or three ﬂights . The building in which we conducted the experiment was a research building with six ﬂoors and nine clinical departments . The elevator was most crowded before 9 : 00 in the morning and after 17 : 00 in the afternoon because of the commuting traﬃc , and was moderately crowded between 12 : 00 and 14 : 00 because of the lunch break . The experiment was conducted between 9 : 00 – 12 : 00 am and 14 : 00 – 17 : 00 pm , during which time the traﬃc was generally considered mild . Divergent Thinking The commonly employed AUT was used to evaluate divergent thinking . In this test , given 4 min , subjects had to think of original and unusual uses of three common objects ( e . g . , “brick” ) and write their answers on a blank paper sheet of A4 - size . Diﬀerent objects were used for each phase of intervention , the order of which was also randomized for each subject . Following previous studies , ﬂuency , ﬂexibility , and originality were employed as indicators of divergent thinking ( Runco and Acar , 2012 ; Reiter - Palmon et al . , 2019 ) . Fluency was deﬁned as the total number of unusual uses ( excluding the common use of each object ) . Flexibility was deﬁned as the total number of conceptual categories the uses are from ( e . g . , “dumbbell” and “objects for muscle training” belong to the same conceptual category ) . Originality was the rareness of the uses and here deﬁned according to the conceptual category of the uses . That is , only if a single participant generated use ( s ) from a speciﬁc conceptual category , that category was considered original ; if two participants generated use ( s ) from the same conceptual category , the category was considered original for neither of them . Before scoring all responses , the primary coder ( i . e . , the ﬁrst author ) ﬁrst received extensive training with the scoring method . Using data from our previous study , the primary coder reached almost perfect agreement ( Cohen , 1960 ) with our previous coder , as indicated by Cohen’s κ = 0 . 970 and 0 . 812 for ﬂexibility and originality , respectively . After training , the primary coder scored all participants while staying blinded to the intervention order . To further ensure reliability , we also asked a secondary coder to score responses for a randomly selected object . The two coders reached an agreement of κ = 1 . 000 and 0 . 789 for ﬂexibility and originality , respectively . Convergent Thinking The matchstick arithmetic problems created by Knoblich et al . ( 1999 ) were used to measure convergent thinking . Each problem was shown as an incorrect equation written with Roman numerals made by matchsticks and subjects had to move one stick to make the equation correct . For instance , for the problem of IV = III + III , the correct answer was to move one stick from the left side of “IV” to its right side to form “VI . ” Three diﬀerent types of problems depending on the way of moving the matchstick were selected for each set of divergent thinking test ( administered after each phase of intervention ) . Based on our pilot testing , the time limit was set to 4 min . The number of correctly solved problems was used as the indicator of convergent thinking . At the beginning of the experiment on the test day of convergent thinking , all subjects were ﬁrst trained to be able to recognize the Roman numerals . After they ﬁnished the second phase of convergent thinking test , subjects were also asked if they had ever seen any of the matchstick problems tested . No subjects had seen exactly the same problems before the study . Statistical Analysis The statistical analysis was conducted with IBM SPSS Statistics 26 . 0 . Due to non - normal distribution based on the Shapiro – Wilk test , Wilcoxon signed - rank tests were used to compare divergent and convergent thinking indicators after the stair - climbing versus control intervention . Two - way repeated measures ANOVAs were used investigate the eﬀect of the test day ( divergent versus convergent thinking ) and the intervention ( stair - climbing versus control ) on heart rate , time taken to return to the laboratory room , and post - intervention mood .

Stair - Climbing Divergent and Convergent Thinking ( Faul et al . , 2007 ) was used for calculating eﬀect sizes . P < 0 . 05 was considered signiﬁcant . RESULTS Heart Rate , Time Taken , and Mood Measures As reported in Table 1 , two - way repeated measures ANOVAs indicated a signiﬁcant eﬀect of intervention on heart rate ( p < 0 . 001 ) and time taken to return to the laboratory room ( p < 0 . 001 ) , while the eﬀect of test day and the intervention and test day interaction remained insigniﬁcant . The data on diﬀerent test days were therefore combined together and plotted in Figure 2A . As can be seen , compared to using the elevator , stair - climbing increased heart rate ( 109 . 66 ± 11 . 198 versus 91 . 89 ± 11 . 418 bpm , d = 3 . 547 ) and cost less time ( 173 . 82 ± 23 . 890 versus 228 . 98 ± 57 . 760 s , d = 0 . 937 ) . There were no signiﬁcant eﬀect of the intervention , test day , or their interaction on the post - intervention mood measures ( Figure 2B and Table 1 ) . Divergent and Convergent Thinking Scatterplots of the data of divergent and convergent thinking are shown in Figure 3 . Wilcoxon signed - rank tests indicated that compared to using the elevator , stair - climbing signiﬁcantly increased originality ( Z = 1 . 977 , p = 0 . 048 , d = 0 . 486 ) but not ﬂuency ( Z = 0 . 164 , p = 0 . 870 , d = 0 . 056 ) or ﬂexibility ( Z = 0 . 196 , p = 0 . 845 , d = 0 . 076 ) on the AUT . Thus , stair - climbing increased divergent thinking not because subjects thought of more uses ( as there was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in ﬂuency ) but because they thought of more original uses . To further verify this conclusion , we divided the number of original uses by the number of total uses generated for each subject . After using the elevator , subjects produced 2 . 3 ± 1 . 461 original uses for every 10 generated uses . In contrast , after stair - climbing , they produced 3 . 7 ± 2 . 246 original uses for every 10 generated uses . This diﬀerence was signiﬁcant as indicated by a Wilcoxon signed - rank test ( Z = 2 . 207 , p = 0 . 027 , d = 0 . 532 ) . In other words , compared to using the elevator , subjects on average generated 61 % more original uses after stair - climbing . With regards to convergent thinking , subjects’ performance on the matchstick test did not diﬀer after using the elevator versus after stair - climbing ( Z = 0 . 428 , p = 0 . 669 , d = 0 . 085 ) . Lastly , we also investigated if the eﬀect of stair - climbing on originality was associated with subjects’ regular physical activity level . The results , however , indicated no signiﬁcant correlations between the change of originality and total physical activity , vigorous physical activity , moderate physical activity , or walking ( all p > 0 . 503 ) . DISCUSSION To our knowledge , this is the ﬁrst study to investigate the eﬀect of stair - climbing on creative thinking . We found that compared to using the elevator , stair - climbing enhanced subjects’ originality on the AUT , indicating improved divergent thinking . Subjects on average generated 61 % more original uses after stair - climbing than after using the elevator . In contrast , stair - climbing did not aﬀect convergent thinking as evaluated by the matchstick arithmetic problems . As a daily physical activity , stair - climbing increased subjects’ heart rate more than using the elevator ( d = 3 . 547 ) . Using the commonly employed formula ( 220 - age ) as an estimation of maximum heart rate and considering the average age of all subject was 21 . 36 years , the intensity of the stair - climbing here ( with a mean heart rate of 109 . 66 bpm ) was equal to 55 % maximum heart rate , or very light ( American College of Sports Medicine [ ACSM ] , 2013 ) . Our results suggest that stair - climbing in very light intensity in a natural , real - life setting may enhance divergent thinking . Furthermore , in our experiment , because of the waiting time to use the elevator , stair - climbing also cost less time ( d = 0 . 937 ) . Thus , compared to using the elevator , at least for people at the fourth ﬂoor , stair - climbing may be a preferred moving method because of its higher eﬃciency and divergent thinking - enhancing eﬀect . Among the three measures of divergent thinking , stair - climbing enhanced originality but not ﬂuency or ﬂexibility . Whereas the explanation of such result is unclear , one possibility is that stair - climbing did not change vigor or arousal level in the present study and the latter , however , is required for the enhancing of ﬂuency and ﬂexibility ( Aga et al . , 2021 ) . Nevertheless , compared to ﬂuency and ﬂexibility , originality is generally considered more important and the key component of divergent thinking ( Runco and Acar , 2012 ; Oppezzo and Schwartz , 2014 ) . Based on previous reports that stepping over obstacles and precision stepping activate the prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) , a primary neural substrate of divergent thinking , cognitive ﬂexibility , and executive functions in general ( Yuan and Raz , 2014 ; Dajani and Uddin , 2015 ; Wu et al . , 2015 ) , we hypothesized that stair - climbing enhances divergent and convergent thinking . Our hypothesis , however , was only partially supported . Our results are consistent with Oppezzo and Schwartz TABLE 1 | The results of two - way repeated measures ANOVAs of heart rate , time taken to return to the laboratory room , and post - intervention mood measures .

( Oppezzo and Schwartz , 2014 ) , who reported that walking on a treadmill for 4 min at a self - selected pace improved divergent ( evaluated by the AUT ) but not convergent thinking ( evaluated by the compound remote - association test ) . It is unclear why walking aﬀects divergent but not convergent thinking despite the observation that both divergent and convergent thinking are related to the functioning of the PFC ( Kleibeuker et al . , 2013 ; Yuan and Raz , 2014 ; Dajani and Uddin , 2015 ; Wu et al . , 2015 ; Peña et al . , 2019 ) . One possibility might be that the impact of aerobic exercise on convergent thinking depends on post - exercise mood ( Aga et al . , 2021 ) , which , however , is not aﬀected by walking or stair - climbing at very light intensity . This possibility remains to be tested by future well - designed studies . Regarding the neurobiological basis of the divergent thinking - enhancing eﬀect of walking and stair - climbing , another potential mechanism in addition to the PFC may be the release of dopamine in response to physical activity ( Chen et al . , 2016 , 2017 ) . This proposal is based on the ﬁnding that dopamine is relevant to cognitive ﬂexibility ( Klanker et al . , 2013 ) and associative or reinforcement learning ( Chen , 2015 ; Chen et al . , 2015 ) , two cognitive processes underlying divergent thinking ( Benedek et al . , 2012 ) . As an everyday life physical activity , climbing stairs at comfortable or fast paces and with or without carrying groceries or other loads , has been a recommended physical activity in many governmental guidelines ( Japanese Ministry of Health Labour and Welfare [ JMHLW ] , 2013 ; US Department of Health and Human Services , 2018 ) . Few studies , however , have investigated Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 5 January 2022 | Volume 15 | Article 834097 fnbeh - 15 - 834097 January 24 , 2022 Time : 14 : 55 # 6 Matsumoto et al . Stair - Climbing Divergent and Convergent Thinking s the speciﬁc physical and mental health beneﬁts of stair - climbing . Allison et al . ( 2017 ) reported that brief intense stair - climbing involving 3 × 20 s “all - out” eﬀorts produced robust physiological changes , including increased heart rate and blood lactate . Stenling et al . ( 2019 ) reported that compared to after no exercise , subjects had increased heart rate and felt more energetic , less tense , and less tired after three 1 - min stair - climbing sessions ( with 1 - min recovery in between ) . In this study , males but not females showed better switching performance and neither showed improved inhibitory control ability ( Stenling et al . , 2019 ) . These results , however , need to be replicated because their sample size was small ( n = 11 for males ) . Our current study adds novel evidence to the literature of stair - climbing that a brief very light intensity stair - climbing enhances divergent thinking . As it has been reported that regular walking is associated with improved divergent but not convergent thinking ( Nakagawa et al . , 2020 ; Chen et al . , 2021 ) , future research may further investigate if regular stair - climbing has similar cognitive beneﬁts . Our study also had several limitations . Firstly , we used stair - climbing in a natural , real - life setting as our intervention , the intensity of which therefore was heterogeneous for each subject . This is diﬀerent from heart rate reserve or aerobic capacity reserve - based exercise prescriptions ( American College of Sports Medicine [ ACSM ] , 2013 ) . It is possible that people with higher aerobic capacity tend to use stairs more often and for more ﬂights , although they may be unable to choose which ﬂoor to use for work or living . Secondly , we only tested stair - climbing as a round - trip between the fourth and the ﬁrst ﬂoors . The intervention was considered very light in intensity and it is possible that stair - climbing at this very light intensity was unable to eﬀectively enhance divergent thinking in some subjects . Future research is thus required to test stair - climbing at higher intensities to see if it boosts divergent thinking in all subjects . Thirdly , we used but one common test for the evaluation of divergent and convergent thinking , respectively . To validate our results , future studies should also test the eﬀect of stair - climbing on other popular tests of divergent and convergent thinking . Fourthly , we limited our subjects to those in their twenties in order to exclude the confounding eﬀect of age and improve statistical power . This , however , also limits the generalization of our ﬁndings to other populations . Future studies with more diverse subjects are needed to test whether our ﬁndings generalize to other populations . CONCLUSION In a randomized controlled trial with a within - subjects crossover posttest comparison design , we found that compared to using the elevator , a brief stair - climbing intervention involving a round - trip walking for three ﬂights enhanced divergent thinking in a sample of healthy young adults . Subjects on average generated 61 % more original uses after stair - climbing than after using the elevator . Furthermore , stair - climbing cost less time compared to using the elevator . Our ﬁndings suggest that stair - climbing may be an eﬃcient and useful strategy for enhancing divergent thinking in everyday life .
