Results : Using a new methodology , we provide experimental evidence for the bidirectional cell membrane transport of endo - cannabinoids containing an arachidonoyl chain . Conclusion : Endocannabinoid release and uptake are regulated by a membrane - based target independent of intracellular proteins . Significance : A specific bidirectional membrane transporter for the major endocannabinoids is postulated . Despite extensive research on the trafficking of anandamide ( AEA ) across cell membranes , little is known about the mem - brane transport of other endocannabinoids , such as 2 - arachi - donoylglycerol ( 2 - AG ) . Previous studies have provided data both in favor and against a cell membrane carrier - mediated transport of endocannabinoids , using different methodological approaches . Because AEA and 2 - AG undergo rapid and almost complete intracellular hydrolysis , we employed a combination of radioligand assays and absolute quantification of cellular and extracellular endocannabinoid levels . In human U937 leukemia cells , 100 n M AEA and 1 (cid:1) M 2 - AG were taken up through a fast andsaturableprocess , reachingaplateauafter5min . Employing differential pharmacological blockage of endocannabinoid uptake , breakdown , and interaction with intracellular binding proteins , we show that eicosanoid endocannabinoids harboring an arachidonoyl chain compete for a common membrane target that regulates their transport , whereas other N - acylethanol - amines did not interfere with AEA and 2 - AG uptake . By com - bining fatty acid amide hydrolase or monoacyl glycerol lipase inhibitors with hydrolase - inactive concentrations of the AEA transport inhibitors UCM707 ( 1 (cid:1) M ) and OMDM - 2 ( 5 (cid:1) M ) , a functional synergism on cellular AEA and 2 - AG uptake was observed . Intriguingly , structurally unrelated AEA uptake inhibitors also blocked the cellular release of AEA and 2 - AG . We show , for the first time , that UCM707 and OMDM - 2 inhibit the bidirectional movement of AEA and 2 - AG across cell mem - branes . Our findings suggest that a putative endocannabinoid cell membrane transporter controls the cellular AEA and 2 - AG trafficking and metabolism . The endocannabinoid system is a lipid signaling system com - prising arachidonic acid - derived ligands , such as arachidonoyl - ethanolamide ( AEA ) 2 and 2 - arachidonoylglycerol ( 2 - AG ) , which interact with the G protein - coupled cannabinoid recep - tors CB 1 and CB 2 in different cell types ( 1 , 2 ) . The diverse roles of the endocannabinoid system ( ECS ) in physiological and pathological processes have been elucidated both in the central nervous system and in the periphery . In the last decade , exten - sive biomedical research has provided insights into how the ECS works at a mechanistic level and thus revealed new per - spectives for drug discovery ( 1 ) . Besides the cannabinoid recep - tors , the major endocannabinoid catabolic enzymes fatty acid amide hydrolase ( FAAH ) ( 3 ) and monoacyl glycerol lipase ( MAGL ) ( 4 ) , several new proteins have been identified as new members of the ECS . These include the hydrolyzing enzymes N - acylethanolamine - hydrolyzing acid amidase ( 5 , 6 ) , FAAH - 2 ( 7 ) , (cid:1) , (cid:2) - hydrolase - 6 and - 12 ( ABHD - 6 and - 12 ) ( 8 ) , AEA - bind - ing fatty acid - binding proteins ( FABPs ) ( 9 ) , and other potential intracellular AEA carrier proteins like Hsp70 and albumin ( 10 ) and more recently the FAAH - like cytoplasmic AEA transporter ( FLAT ) ( 11 ) . Despite an increasing knowledge about the recep - tors and signaling pathways involved in the ECS , the movement of AEA and 2 - AG across the cell membrane remains to be elu - cidated and is subject to ongoing controversy ( 12 ) . Previous studies have addressed the issue of intracellular AEA uptake , providing strong evidence in favor of a carrier - mediated trans - port that is linked to but distinctly independent of the enzy - matic hydrolysis of AEA by FAAH ( 13 – 18 ) .

In addition to the carrier - mediated mecha - nism , two other models have been proposed for AEA uptake : the simple cellular diffusion driven by its fast and efficient cyto - plasmic breakdown mediated by FAAH ( 22 – 25 ) and a carrier - mediated caveolae - related endocytotic process ( 26 , 27 ) . Sur - prisingly , few studies have addressed the uptake mechanism of 2 - AG , which is the major endocannabinoid in brain and periph - eral tissues ( 12 , 28 , 29 ) . Given the strong pharmacological evi - dence in favor of a facilitated endocannabinoid membrane transport mechanism , the prevalent hypothesis supports the model of a putative membrane transporter ( 29 – 35 ) . However , such an endocannabinoid membrane transporter ( EMT ) has not yet been identified . Moreover , it remains to be elucidated whether AEA , 2 - AG , and other endocannabinoids share the same membrane transport mechanism . Another poorly inves - tigated aspect is the process of cellular release subsequent to the biosynthesis of AEA and 2 - AG at the inner membrane leaflet ( 36 ) . It has been proposed that endocannabinoids are released directly from the cell membrane , where they are generated , but only few studies imply that a bidirectional membrane trans - porter could be involved in the release of AEA into the extra - cellular space ( 16 , 37 – 39 ) . Here we have experimentally addressed the issue of AEA and 2 - AG cellular uptake using U937 human monocytes / macrophages . Given the complexity and pitfalls involved in the handling of endocannabinoid lipids ( 40 , 41 ) , we employed a combination of two independent detec - tion methods . We used the classical radioactivity - based assays as well as a direct gas chromatography ( GC ) / MS - based analyt - ical quantification of endocannabinoids . Applying this inte - grated methodology and using diverse combinations of phar - macological tool compounds , we have obtained data that strongly support a carrier - mediated cell membrane transport of AEA and 2 - AG in U937 cells . Our results clearly suggest a com - mon putative EMT specific for the eicosanoid endocannabi - noids AEA , 2 - AG , N - arachidonoyl dopamine ( NADA ) , 2 - arachidonyl glyceryl ether ( noladin ether ; 2 - AGE ) , and O - arachidonoyl ethanolamine ( virodhamine ) . This study also provides evidence that the putative EMT is mechanistically independent from the newly described AEA intracellular car - rier proteins and degrading enzymes . Finally , our data strongly suggest that the putative EMT works in a bidirectional manner and also mediates the release of AEA and 2 - AG . Although the EMT has not yet been cloned and identified , for the sake of clarity , we use the terms “EMT” and “EMT inhibitor , ” implicitly referring to the putative EMT . Overall , our study provides new evidence in favor of a membrane target that regulates the extra - cellular and intracellular levels of endocannabinoids in an orchestrated manner together with the cytoplasmic carrier pro - teins and degrading enzymes .

[ ethanolamine - 1 - 3 H ] AEA ( 60Ci / mmol ) and [ 1 , 2 , 3 - 3 H ] 2 - AG ( 20 – 40 Ci / mmol ) were obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals , Inc . Cell Culture —Human monocytic leukemia U937 cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection ( Manassas , VA ) and were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum , 1 g / ml fungizone ( amphotericin B ) , 100 units / ml penicillin , 100 g / ml streptomycin , and 2 m M L - glutamine ( all from Invitrogen ) . The U937 monocytic cells were differentiated into macrophages using 2 ng / ml phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ( PMA ; Sigma ) for 48 h , according to standard procedures ( 42 – 44 ) . Cells were grown in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 at 37 °C in humidified 5 % CO 2 atmosphere . Radioactivity - based Determination of Endocannabinoid Uptake —The uptake of [ ethanolamine - 1 - 3 H ] AEA ( 60 Ci / mmol ) and [ 1 , 2 , 3 - 3 H ] 2 - AG , ( 20 – 40 Ci / mmol ) in intact cells was performed by using U937 and PMA - differentiated U937 ( macrophage ) cells . Briefly , 10 6 cells were suspended in 500 (cid:3) l of serum - free medium in silanized plastic tubes and preincu - bated with different concentrations of inhibitors for 10 – 30 min at 37 °C , depending on the experiment . Plastic or glass tubes were filled with AquaSil TM siliconizing fluid ( ThermoScien - tific ) , and after 1 min , the silanizing agent was removed and discarded . The tubes were rinsed with pure methanol and then allowed to dry overnight at room temperature . Combination experiments were performed by co - preincubating the cells with both FAAH and EMT inhibitors . Successively , cells were added with a mixture of either AEA / [ 3 H ] AEA to a final concentration of 100 n M or 2 - AG / [ 3 H ] 2 - AG to a final concentration of 1 (cid:3) M and then incubated for 5 min at 37 °C . Time course experiments were performed by incubation of the cells from 30 s to 60 min . In AEA plus 2 - AG and AEA and / or 2 - AG plus other lipids ( endocannabinoids or N - acylethanolamines ) combination experiments , the endocannabinoids were co - incubated for 5 min with the cells without preincubation . The uptake process was stopped by transferring the tubes on ice and rapidly centri - fuging them at 800 (cid:2) g for 5 min at 4 °C . The supernatant was collected ( 500 (cid:3) l ) and transferred into 1 ml of a methanol / chloroform mixture ( 1 : 1 , v / v ) , whereas the pellet was resus - pended in ice - cold PBS plus 1 % fatty acid - free BSA and centri - fuged at 800 (cid:2) g for 5 min at 4 °C ( washing step ) .

The cell pellet was resus - pended in 250 (cid:3) l of ice - cold PBS and transferred into 500 (cid:3) l of a methanol / chloroform mixture ( 1 : 1 , v / v ) , vortexed vigorously , sonicated in an ice - cold water bath for 5 min , and finally cen - trifuged at 10 , 000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C . The aqueous phase was pooled with the aqueous phase extracted from the super - natant and transferred in a scintillation tube , whereas the lipo - philic phase was transferred in a different tube . The radioactiv - ity measured in the pooled aqueous phases represented the amount of [ 3 H ] ethanolamine or [ 3 H ] glycerol generated by [ 3 H ] AEA or [ 3 H ] 2 - AG hydrolysis , respectively . The intracellu - lar and extracellular amount of [ 3 H ] AEA and [ 3 H ] 2 - AG as well as the [ 3 H ] glycerol and [ 3 H ] ethanolamine formation were measured by adding 3 ml of Ultima Gold scintillation liquid ( PerkinElmer Life Sciences ) using a Packard Tri - Carb 2100 TR scintillation counter ( PerkinElmer Life Sciences ) . Data were collected from at least three independent experiments per - formed in triplicate , and results were expressed as [ 3 H ] ethano - lamine ( or [ 3 H ] glycerol ) formation and intracellular or extra - cellular [ 3 H ] AEA ( or [ 3 H ] 2 - AG ) reduction or accumulation in percentage of the vehicle - treated samples . Construction of Theoretical Curves for Additivity and Inde - pendent Interaction —In order to investigate the type of inter - action between EMT and FAAH inhibitors , when applied in combination to the cells , we made use of an empirical method previously described by Po¨ch et al . ( 45 – 48 ) . This method allows analysis of the combination of increasing concentrations of a compound A ( the FAAH inhibitors URB597 and PMSF ) in the presence of a fixed concentration of the compound B ( the EMT inhibitor UCM707 at 1 (cid:3) M or OMDM - 2 at 5 (cid:3) M ) . The construction of the theoretical curves is based upon the assumption that A and B contribute to the overall effect , either interacting on the same target or on two different targets . In the first case , it is assumed that B behaves like A , thus interacting at the same target . This leads to the construction of the theoretical curve for additivity . In this case , B can be seen as a dilution of A , which is equieffective with a certain concentration of A , termed x . Based on this assumption , the expected effects of the combi - nation A (cid:3) B represent the effects of A (cid:3) x ( where x is the concentration of A that is equieffective to B ) . As a consequence , the theoretical curve for additivity is constructed by replotting the concentration curve of A to the left of the original curve by a distance x . In line with the definition of the additivity given above , at the highest concentration of A , the E max reached by the combination A (cid:3) B does not differ from the one obtained by applying only A . The construction of the theoretical curve for “independent interaction” is based on the assumption that A and B act independently on two distinct targets . This curve is constructed by using Equation 1 , E A (cid:3) B (cid:4) E A (cid:3) E B (cid:5) ( E A (cid:2) E B ) ( Eq . 1 ) where the E max is 1 . Thus , the response to A (cid:3) B is expressed as a fraction of the maximum frequency . If the interaction between A and B is independent , the theoretical curve will appear upward shifted compared with the concentration - effect curve of A . The magnitude of such a shift is determined by the response to B . The independent interaction is also called “func - tional synergy” ( 48 ) . Radioactivity - based Determination of Endocannabinoid Release —Thereleaseof [ ethanolamine - 1 - 3 H ] AEA ( 60Ci / mmol ) and [ 1 , 2 , 3 - 3 H ] 2 - AG ( 20 – 40 Ci / mmol ) was carried out in U937 cells . Briefly , 10 6 cells were suspended in 500 (cid:3) l of serum - free medium in silanized plastic tubes and preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C with a degrading enzyme inhibitor mixture in order to block AEA and 2 - AG hydrolysis . 100 n M URB597 plus 1 (cid:3) M PMSF was used to fully avoid AEA cleavage , whereas a mix of 1 (cid:3) M JZL184 , 10 (cid:3) M WWL70 , and 20 (cid:3) M tetrahydrolipstatin was used to block 2 - AG breakdown . Afterward , cells were loaded with a mix of “cold / hot” endocannabinoid through a 5 - min incubation at 37 °C to allow the cells to intracellularly accumu - late the molecules . Next , the cells were centrifuged for 5 min at 800 (cid:2) g , the supernatant was discarded , and a washing step with PBS plus 1 % BSA was performed in order to eliminate the resid - ual endocannabinoid molecules stuck on the external plasma membrane leaflet . After a subsequent centrifugation step , cells were resuspended in endocannabinoid - free PBS containing 1 % fatty acid free BSA as AEA and 2 - AG extracellular acceptor and incubated for 25 min at 37 °C . Finally cells were centrifuged at 800 (cid:2) g for 5 min at 4 °C , and the pellet and the supernatant underwent an aqueous / organic separation phase as described above . The radioactivity associated with the intracellular and extracellular [ 3 H ] AEA and [ 3 H ] 2 - AG was measured by adding 3 ml of Ultima Gold scintillation liquid ( PerkinElmer Life Sci - ences ) using a Packard Tri - Carb 2100 TR scintillation counter ( PerkinElmer Life Sciences ) . The radioactivity of the aqueous phase was measured to confirm the absence of endocannabi - noid hydrolysis . Data were collected from at least three inde - pendent experiments performed in triplicate , and results were expressed as [ 3 H ] AEA ( or [ 3 H ] 2 - AG ) intracellular and extracel - lular levels as a percentage of the vehicle - treated samples . FAAH Activity —FAAH activity was assessed by using either pig brain or U937 cell homogenates , as described previously ( 49 ) . Briefly , 10 (cid:3) l of the inhibitor at the adequate concentra - tion or vehicle control was preincubated for 15 min at 37 °C with 490 (cid:3) l of diluted pig brain ( 200 (cid:3) g / sample ) or U937 cell homogenates ( corresponding to 10 6 cells (cid:4) 0 . 63 mg of total protein ) in 10 m M Tris - HCl , 1 m M EDTA , pH 8 . 0 , plus 0 . 1 % fatty acid - free BSA . A mixture of 100 n M AEA plus [ 3 H ] AEA was added to the samples and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C . Suc - cessively , 1 ml of methanol / chloroform mixture ( 1 : 1 , v / v ) was added , and after vigorous vortexing , the aqueous and organic phases were separated by centrifugation at 10 , 000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C . The radioactivity associated with the [ 3 H ] ethano - lamine was measured upon the addition of 3 ml of Ultima Gold scintillation liquid ( PerkinElmer Life Sciences ) to the aqueous phase , using a Packard Tri - Carb 2100 TR liquid scintillation analyzer . Results were expressed as percentage of FAAH activ - ity versus vehicle - treated homogenate . Quantification of AEA and 2 - AG Levels by GC / MS —After incubation with the compounds , cells were pelleted by centrif - ugation at 800 (cid:2) g , and supernatant was removed . Cell pellets were subsequently washed with 1 % fatty acid - free BSA and again centrifuged at 800 (cid:2) g at 4 °C . Both supernatants were combined for extraction , and for quantification ; the cells were Bidirectional Endocannabinoid Cell Membrane Transport 34662 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 287•NUMBER 41• OCTOBER 5 , 2012 a t UG I S E R V E I D ADQU I S I C I ON S on M a r c h 4 , 2015 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m analyzed separately . The quantification of the AEA and 2 - AG levels was performed according to our recently published method ( 50 ) . Lipid Extraction —Cell pellets were resuspended into 250 (cid:3) l of PBS and transferred to 1 . 5 ml of ice - cold chloroform / meth - anol mixture ( 2 : 1 , v / v ) containing internal standards yielding a 4 : 2 : 1 ratio ( CHCl 3 / CH 3 OH / H 2 O , v / v / v ) ( 51 ) . The suspension was vortexed vigorously , sonicated for 5 min in an ice - cold water bath and then centrifuged for 10 min at 500 (cid:2) g at 4 °C . The organic phase was recovered into a glass vial , dried under N 2 reconstituted in 1 ml of ethanol , diluted with 9 ml of water , and finally extracted by solid - phase extraction ( C - 18 Sep - Pak cartridge ( Waters AG , Baden - Da¨ttwil , Switzerland ) ) . Superna - tants were diluted in 1 ml of ethanol ( containing internal stand - ards ) , and water was added to reach the final volume of 10 ml . The lipids were extracted by solid - phase extraction ( C - 18 Sep - Pak cartridge ( Waters AG ) ) . The internal standards used for the quantification were as follows : N - arachidonoylethano - lamine - d 4 ( 1 ng / (cid:3) l ) ( 25 ng / sample ) and 2 - arachidonoylglyc - erol - d 5 ( 8 ng / (cid:3) l ) ( 200 ng / sample ) . Derivatization and GC / MS Conditions —Derivatization of the hydroxyl groups was performed with the silylating agent dimethylisopropylsilyl imidazole at room temperature for 1 h as reported previously ( 52 ) . Samples were subjected to a Sephadex LH - 20 column and eluted with hexane / chloroform / methanol ( 10 : 10 : 1 ) . After evaporation to dryness , samples were resus - pended in 25 (cid:3) l of hexane and subsequently analyzed by GC / electron ionization mass spectrometry using an Agilent 6890 N gas chromatograph equipped with a 30 - meter HP - 5MS column and a 5975 C electron ionization mass spectrometer with a triple - axis detector . Helium was used as the carrier gas at a constant flow rate of 1 . 5 ml / min with splitless injection at an inlet temperature of 250 °C . Optimal separation of the analytes was achieved with the following oven program : initial temper - ature 150 °C for 1 min followed by an increase to 280 °C at 8 °C / min with a final time of 20 min . Due to acyl group migra - tion of 2 - AG during lipid extraction and purification , a signifi - cant amount of 1 - AG was formed . Therefore , the peak areas of 1 - AG and 2 - AG were combined for all quantifications as already described ( 53 ) . Thin Layer Chromatography ( TLC ) Analysis —U937 cells or U937 macrophages ( 10 6 ) were suspended in 500 (cid:3) l of serum - free medium in silanized plastic tubes and incubated with dif - ferent concentrations of [ 3 H ] AEA or [ 3 H ] 2 - AG for 5 min at 37 °C , depending on the experiment . Afterward , the cells were centrifuged for 5 min at 800 (cid:2) g at 4 °C . Supernatants were collected , and cell pellets were resuspended in 250 (cid:3) l of PBS and transferred to 1 . 5 ml of ice - cold chloroform / methanol mix - ture ( 2 : 1 , v / v ) . The suspension was vortexed vigorously , soni - cated for 5 min in an ice - cold water bath , and centrifuged for 10 min at 500 (cid:2) g . Organic and aqueous phases were separated and dried under N 2 . The organic phase was reconstituted in 10 (cid:3) l of chloroform , and the aqueous phase was reconstituted in 5 (cid:3) l of water and applied to the TLC plate . The same procedure was carried out for the supernatant . Lipids were separated by one - dimensional TLC on Silica Gel 60 plates ( Merck ) in a solvent system composed of chloroform / methanol / acetic acid / water ( 25 : 15 : 4 : 2 , v / v / v / v ) and visualized by exposure to iodine vapor . The radioactive lipids were detected on dried TLC plates using a radioisotope detector ( Berthold Technologies ) and quantified by using the Rita Con - trol software provided by the manufacturer . RT - PCR Analyses of ABHDs —Total RNA was extracted from U937 cells and U937 macrophages , and mRNA was reverse - transcribed as described previously ( 54 ) . cDNA samples were amplified for 35 cycles : 1 min at 95 °C ; 1 min at 64 . 1 °C ( ABHD - 6 ) , 70 °C ( ABHD - 12 ) , or 55 °C ( GAPDH ) ; 1 min at 72 °C plus an elongation step at 72 °C for 10 min . Primers used were 5 (cid:1) - GCTCAGTGTGGTCAAGTTCCTTCCA - 3 (cid:1) ( forward ) and 5 (cid:1) - TTCCATCACTACTGAGTGCCCACAG - 3 (cid:1) ( reverse ) for ABHD - 6 ; 5 (cid:1) - GGGTGACTCAGTGGGAACGCC - 3 (cid:1) ( forward ) and 5 (cid:1) - GCTGCTGACTGGAGGAAAACGGG - 3 (cid:1) ( reverse ) for ABHD - 12 ; 5 (cid:1) - GTGAAGGTCGGTGTCAACG - 3 (cid:1) ( forward ) and 5 (cid:1) - GGTGAAGACGCCAGTAGACTC - 3 (cid:1) ( reverse ) for GAPDH . The expected amplification products were 673 - , 638 - , and 300 - bp - long , respectively . ABHD - 6 and - 12 primers were designed by Oligo - Primer Analysis Software version 4 . 0 , whereas GAPDH primer sequences were as published previ - ously ( 54 ) . Statistical Analysis —Results are expressed as mean values (cid:6) S . E . of at least three independent experiments performed in triplicate . Statistical significance of differences between groups was determined by Student’s t test ( unpaired t test ) with GraphPad Prism version 5 software . Statistical significance was evaluated using two - tailed unpaired t tests against controls . Differences between the analyzed samples were considered as significant if p was (cid:4) 0 . 05 . RESULTS AEA and 2 - AG Uptake Kinetics and Reincorporation into Phospholipids —First , the kinetics of [ 3 H ] AEA and [ 3 H ] 2 - AG uptake into human monocyte - like U937 cells was evaluated in the time range from 30 s to 60 min . U937 cells have previously been reported to exhibit good AEA uptake ( K m value (cid:7) 0 . 2 (cid:3) M ) ( 55 ) . The data shown in Fig . 1 clearly indicate that both mole - cules are taken up through a fast and saturable process and undergo a rapid and almost complete intracellular hydrolysis . The intracellular [ 3 H ] AEA and [ 3 H ] 2 - AG levels , as well as their hydrolytic products formed , showed a hyperbolic increase over time , reaching a plateau after (cid:7) 5 min of incubation . Accord - ingly , the extracellular clearance of [ 3 H ] AEA and [ 3 H ] 2 - AG fol - lowed the mirrored hyperbolic trend ( Fig . 1 , A and B ) . In both endocannabinoids the 3 H labels were in the headgroup of the lipid , which is ethanolamine for AEA and glycerol for 2 - AG . Interestingly , upon methanol / chloroform phase separation , the level of glycerol was more than double the ethanolamine level at each time point , whereas the intracellular amount of the rela - tive endocannabinoid precursor showed an opposite trend , with AEA being more than double the 2 - AG level . In order to investigate this unexpected difference , we performed TLC analyses of the intra - and extracellular sources of the radioac - tive signal . Although it has previously been reported that etha - nolamine generated upon [ 14 C ] AEA hydrolysis in RBL - 2H3 rat basophilic leukemia cells is not incorporated into membrane phospholipids ( PLs ) ( 25 ) , our results clearly show a significant incorporation of [ 3 H ] ethanolamine into U937 membrane phos - Bidirectional Endocannabinoid Cell Membrane Transport OCTOBER 5 , 2012• VOLUME 287•NUMBER 41 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 34663 a t UG I S E R V E I D ADQU I S I C I ON S on M a r c h 4 , 2015 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m FIGURE 1 .

Bidirectional Endocannabinoid Cell Membrane Transport 34664 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 287•NUMBER 41• OCTOBER 5 , 2012 a t UG I S E R V E I D ADQU I S I C I ON S on M a r c h 4 , 2015 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m pholipids . As shown in Fig . 1 C , the bulk of the intracellular radioactive signal after 5 min of incubation did not originate from intact [ 3 H ] AEA but from [ 3 H ] ethanolamine incorporated into phosphatidylethanolamine ( PE ) . The retardation factors of the different PLs and endocannabinoids and degrading prod - ucts were determined on TLC ( data not shown ) . On the other hand , TLC analyses of U937 cells incubated with [ 3 H ] 2 - AG did not reveal any significant incorporation of [ 3 H ] glycerol into PLs ( Fig . 1 D ) . In Table 1 , the relative contributions ( expressed as a percentage of the total radioactive signal ) of the radioactive sources show that 74 . 9 and 0 . 2 % of intracellular radioactivity come from PL - incorporated [ 3 H ] ethanolamine and [ 3 H ] glyc - erol , respectively . Therefore , free [ 3 H ] glycerol accounts for almost 95 % of the total radioactive signal , whereas free ethanol - amine has only a minor contribution ( less than 5 % ) . The [ 3 H ] ethanolamine was detected both intracellularly and extra - cellularly , whereas [ 3 H ] glycerol was recovered almost only extracellularly ( data not shown ) . We performed the same kinetic experiments in differentiated non - proliferating U937 macrophages ( obtained by treating U937 cells with 2 ng / ml PMA for 48 h ) . U937 macrophages showed the same hyperbolic time - dependent increase of the intracellular radioactive signal . However , the intracellular radioactivity was 4 times lower in macrophages than in U937 cells at each time point , whereas the [ 3 H ] ethanolamine level was more than double ( Fig . 1 E ) . The time - dependent extracellular AEA clearance showed the same qualitative and quantitative trend in both cell types ( Fig . 1 , A and E ) . In agreement with this , TLC analyses revealed a remark - able difference in the [ 3 H ] ethanolamine incorporation into PLs because non - proliferating U937 macrophages showed low [ 3 H ] PE levels ( 5 % of total radioactivity signal ) in comparison with U937 cells ( Table 1 ) . No difference was observed in the 2 - AG levels and glycerol formation over time between the two cells types ( Table 1 ) . Based on the above observations , we concluded that the intracellular fate of endocannabinoids and their hydrolytic products has to be taken into consideration when approaching the trafficking and degradation issues . Because experiments using radiolabeled endocannabinoids may be ambiguous due to differential phospholipid incorporation , we assessed the uptake kinetics of AEA and 2 - AG by quantifying their absolute levels by GC / MS . The intracellular AEA level was very high already after 1 min of incubation and then dramatically decreased over time , reaching the plateau after 5 min ( Fig . 1 F ) . The absolute quantification of AEA therefore confirmed the rapid uptake and subsequent intracellular degradation and ethanolamine incorporation into PE . The absolute AEA quantification was performed also in U937 macrophages showing exactly the same kinetics for intra - and extracellular AEA levels ( Fig . 1 F ) . Thus , depending on the cell type , the incorporation of [ 3 H ] ethano - lamine into PE can significantly alter the readout . The same GC / MS experiments were performed using 2 - AG , but it was not possible to measure any intra - or extracellular levels because 2 - AG was below the limit of detection at every time point ( data not shown ) , possibly reflecting its very rapid enzy - matic breakdown at the U937 cell membrane . Independent Interaction between EMT and FAAH Inhibitors upon Cellular Uptake of AEA —To explore the membrane - spe - cific endocannabinoid transport mechanisms , the effects of the commercially available EMT inhibitors UCM707 ( 20 ) and OMDM - 2 ( 19 ) as well as the FAAH inhibitors URB597 ( 56 ) and PMSF ( 57 ) on AEA uptake were tested alone or in combination in U937 cells . First , the IC 50 values of UCM707 and OMDM - 2 were calculated . In agreement with the literature ( 19 , 20 ) , the IC 50 values were 1 . 8 and 5 . 2 (cid:3) M , respectively ( Fig . 2 , A and B ) . Similarly , we measured the effects of URB597 and PMSF on AEA uptake and degradation in U937 cells ( Fig . 2 , C and D ) . Because the enzyme N - acylethanolamine - hydrolyzing acid amidase can be involved in AEA breakdown ( 5 , 6 ) , we also tested the N - acylethanolamine - hydrolyzing acid amidase - se - lective inhibitor CCP in U937 cell homogenate . CCP did not show any effect on AEA degradation up to 30 (cid:3) M . Accordingly , CCP did not affect AEA uptake in U937 cells up to 30 (cid:3) M ( data not shown ) . On the other hand , URB597 and PMSF led to an extracellular accumulation of [ 3 H ] AEA and a reduction of the intracellular [ 3 H ] AEA / [ 3 H ] PE levels and the [ 3 H ] ethanolamine formation ( Fig . 2 , C and D ) . We then chose an EMT inhibitor concentration that produced a 30 – 40 % reduction of AEA uptake ( 1 (cid:3) M for UCM707 and 5 (cid:3) M for OMDM - 2 ) to combine with different concentrations of FAAH inhibitors . Both UCM707 and OMDM - 2 have been shown to specifically inhibit the cellular uptake of AEA up to concentrations of 10 and 30 (cid:3) M , respectively , whereas at higher concentrations , they also inhibited FAAH activity ( 19 , 20 ) . Our data confirmed that UCM707 and OMDM - 2 at 1 and 5 (cid:3) M , respectively , did not inhibit FAAH activity in pig brain homogenate and U937 cells homogenate ( Table 2 ) . In addition , we monitored the kinetics of the AEA uptake inhibition mediated by the two EMT inhib - itors . The data showed identical inhibitory potencies from 30 s to 10 min of incubation ( Fig . 2 E ) , suggesting that these mole - cules bind to a plasma membrane target which regulates AEA entry , thus blocking endocannabinoid uptake independently from the intracellular targets involved in the later phases of AEA trafficking ( see also below ) . In the combination experiments , 1 (cid:3) M UCM707 and 5 (cid:3) M OMDM - 2 were co - incubated with increasing concentrations of FAAH inhibitors , and the cells were subsequently incubated with 100 n M AEA containing 0 . 5 % [ 3 H ] AEA for 5 min . As shown in Fig . 3 , A – D , the intracellular levels of [ 3 H ] AEA / PE was significantly reduced by the combination as compared with the inhibition induced by the FAAH inhibitor alone , leading to the assumption that the two compounds may act synergistically TABLE 1 Intra - and extracellular sources of 3 H signal measured after 5 min of incubationwitheither100n M (cid:8) 3 H (cid:9) AEAplusAEAor1 (cid:1) M (cid:8) 3 H (cid:9) 2 - AGplus 2 - AG with U937 cells and U937 macrophages Thevaluesareexpressedasapercentageofthetotal 3 Hsignal .

FAAH and the EMT ) . In order to test this hypothesis , we constructed two theoretical curves ( see “Experimental Procedures” ) , assuming either a common target for the FAAH and endocannabinoid cell mem - brane transport inhibitors ( theoretical additive curve ) or two distinct targets ( theoretical curve for independent interaction ) . As shown in Fig . 3 , A – D , we calculated both theoretical curves for AEA uptake inhibition ( shown by dotted lines ) by 1 (cid:3) M UCM707 and 5 (cid:3) M OMDM - 2 with increasing concentration of FAAH inhibitor . The experimental combination of a fixed con - centration of the inhibitor of AEA transport with increasing concentrations of the FAAH inhibitor is described by a sigmoi - dal curve that resembles the theoretical curve for independent interaction . As shown in Fig . 3 , A – D , the inhibition curves for combinations were shifted upward compared with the FAAH inhibitor curves . Thus , the [ 3 H ] AEA / PE intracellular levels measured after the treatment with the combinations are signif - icantly lower than the levels measured after the treatment with FAAH inhibitors . In line with the independent interaction model , the E max reached with the combinations is significantly higher than the E max obtained with URB597 and PMSF alone , in agreement with the assumption of two different targets ( see Fig . 3 , A – D ) . Furthermore , at very low and almost FAAH - ineffec - tive concentrations of URB597 ( 10 – 100 p M ) and PMSF ( 1 – 10 n M ) , the effects of the combination on the intracellular [ 3 H ] AEA / PE level were much stronger than the theoretical curves , except for the OMDM - 2 / URB597 combination ( Fig . 3 , A – D ) . The IC 50 values calculated from the inhibition curves of URB597 and PMSF alone or in the presence of 1 (cid:3) M UCM707 or 5 (cid:3) M OMDM - 2 is reported in Table 3 . In agreement with the uptake inhibition data , the extracellu - lar [ 3 H ] AEA accumulation measured after treating the cells with combinations of EMT and FAAH inhibitors was signifi - cantly higher than the effect obtained applying FAAH inhibi - tors alone . In particular , for low and FAAH - ineffective concen - trations of URB597 and PMSF , the extracellular [ 3 H ] AEA levels were higher than the expected levels for 1 (cid:3) M UCM707 ( (cid:1) 280 % versus 197 % of control for combinations and UCM707 , respec - tively ) and for 5 (cid:3) M OMDM - 2 ( (cid:1) 180 % versus 138 % of control for the OMDM - 2 / PMSF combination and OMDM - 2 , respec - tively ) , again supporting an independent effect between EMT and FAAH inhibitors ( Fig . 3 , E – H ) . The same set of experiments were carried out by adding only AEA without [ 3 H ] AEA and quantifying the absolute intracellu - lar and extracellular levels by GC / MS . As shown in Fig . 4 , treat - ment with UCM707 or OMDM - 2 induced a reduction of AEA uptake similar to the one observed in the radioactivity - based FIGURE 2 .

In contrast , however , URB597 and PMSF led to a signif - icant increase of the intracellular AEA level because in the vehi - cle control , the incorporation of ethanolamine did not lead to an overestimation of the intracellular AEA level ( see Fig . 1 ) . When cells were treated with a combination of EMT and FAAH inhibitors , the increase of intracellular AEA was abolished ( Fig . 4 , A and B ) . Thus , when the AEA cellular uptake was inhibited , the FAAH inhibition effects by PMSF and URB597 were not seen . This provides very strong evidence in favor of a mem - brane transporter . Moreover , UCM707 and OMDM - 2 showed identical inhibition of AEA uptake irrespective of the presence of PMSF and URB597 ( Fig . 4 , A and B ) . In agreement , the extra - cellular level of AEA was increased by all of the treatments ( EMT inhibitors , FAAH inhibitors , and combinations ) ( Fig . 4 , C and D ) . Overall , these data clearly indicate that a putative EMT is involved in the first step of AEA cellular uptake . UCM707 or OMDM - 2 Inhibits AEA Uptake without Interfer - ing with FABPs —The degradation of AEA and 2 - AG is medi - ated by several enzymes located in different cellular compart - ments . 2 - AG hydrolysis is catalyzed mainly by MAGL , a soluble enzyme , which has been found to be associated with the inner cell membrane layer and the recently identified ABHD - 6 and ABHD - 12 , which have been proposed to be integral cell mem - brane proteins with the catalytic site facing intra - and extracel - lularly , respectively ( 58 , 59 ) . Therefore , 2 - AG hydrolysis seems to occur almost exclusively at the cell membrane . On the con - trary , the main enzyme involved in the AEA degradation is FAAH , whose localization has been described primarily in the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) ( 3 ) . Once AEA is taken up into the cell , it needs to travel across the cytosol to reach the ER , where it is finally cleaved . AEA is a lipophilic molecule that is not able to move freely across the hydrophilic cytosolic envi - FIGURE 3 .

The existence of such carriers has been suggested several years ago ( 32 ) , but only recently different AEA intracellular binding pro - teins ( AIBPs ) ( 60 ) have been identified , such as FLAT , albumin , Hsp70 , and FABP5 and - 7 ( 10 , 11 , 61 ) . It has also been proposed by Kaczocha et al . ( 9 , 61 ) that FABPs may be the actual target of the EMT inhibitors , which would provide evidence against an membrane protein target . Therefore , we performed experi - ments using two different cell types that either express or do not express the FABPs endogenously . A recent publication described in detail the U937 proteome , showing a negligible expression of FABPs ( 44 ) . When U937 cells were differentiated into macrophage - like cells , a dramatic increase of FABP expres - sion levels was shown ( 44 ) . Making use of this finding , we assessed the effects of UCM707 or OMDM - 2 in U937 mono - cytes and U937 macrophages . As shown in Fig . 5 , A and B ( and Fig . 2 , A and B ) , both UCM707 and OMDM - 2 induced an iden - tical concentration - dependent AEA uptake inhibition and extracellular accumulation in both cell types , indicating that these compounds exert their activity independently from the expression of FABPs . Interestingly , unlike in U937 cells , in U937 macrophages , both inhibitors at concentrations higher than 10 (cid:3) M did not further reduce the cellular uptake . This could be due to the fact that higher concentrations of the UCM707 or OMDM - 2 partially inhibit FAAH activity as we observed in our pig brain and cell homogenate experiments ( data not shown ) . As shown above ( see Fig . 1 , E and F , and Table 1 ) , U937 macrophages exhibit a negligible incorporation of [ 3 H ] ethanolamine , leading to a significantly distinct base - line radioactivity in vehicle - treated cells ( (cid:7) 10 times lower in the U937 macrophages ) . To confirm this , we also tested the effect of URB597 on AEA uptake in U937 cells and U937 macro - phages . The results exhibited the same concentration - depen - dent inhibition of ethanolamine formation , and the extracellu - lar accumulation of [ 3 H ] AEA increased in both cell types ( Figs . 2 C and 5 C ) . On the other hand , URB597 induced a significant intracellular accumulation of [ 3 H ] AEA in macrophages , unlike in U937 cells , where it led to a strong reduction ( Figs . 2 C and 5 C ) . In agreement with the differential fate of [ 3 H ] ethano - lamine in these cell types , we conclude that in U937 macro - phages , UCM707 and OMDM - 2 , at concentrations higher than 10 (cid:3) M , partially inhibit FAAH , leading to a slight accumulation of intracellular [ 3 H ] AEA . The inhibition of EMT and FAAH may contrast with each other , blunting the overall AEA uptake inhibition induced by these AEA transport inhibitors at higher concentrations . It was reported that by using the specific FAPB inhibitor BMS309403 , the AEA uptake was partially inhibited , support - ing a crucial role of FABPs in AEA trafficking and breakdown ( 9 ) . We thus evaluated the effect of BMS309403 in both U937 cells and U937 macrophages . The results shown in Fig . 5 D reveal no inhibition of [ 3 H ] AEA uptake in U937 cells up to 3 (cid:3) M , a concentration that is 10 – 100 times higher than the K i FIGURE 4 .

Conversely , BMS309403 inhibited [ 3 H ] AEA uptake in U937 macrophages already at significantly lower concentrations ( 100 – 300 n M ) , in agreement with its K i value for FABPs ( Fig . 5 D ) . In keeping with this observation , the calculated IC 50 value for [ 3 H ] AEA uptake by BMS309403 in U937 cells was 10 times higher than in U937 macrophages ( 12 . 3 (cid:6) 1 . 1 versus 1 . 2 (cid:6) 0 . 8 (cid:3) M ) ( Fig . 5 D ) . Endocannabinoids with an Arachidonoyl Chain Are Trans - ported via the Same Putative EMT but Not Other N - Acylethanolamines —In contrast to the efforts made to elu - cidate the mechanism of AEA cellular uptake ( for reviews , see Refs . 12 and 63 ) , the movement of 2 - AG across the cell mem - brane has only been investigated marginally . Few papers address the issue of 2 - AG transport , conveying different hypotheses , from simple diffusion to carrier - mediated trans - port by the same EMT proposed for AEA or via a different transporter ( 30 – 33 , 39 , 64 ) . Therefore , here we also investi - gated the cellular uptake of 2 - AG , applying the above described methodology . 100 n M AEA plus [ 3 H ] AEA was co - incubated with increasing concentrations of 2 - AG ( generating different ratios between the two endocannabinoids ) in U937 cells , leading to a compet - itive inhibition of [ 3 H ] AEA uptake with an IC 50 of 1 . 2 (cid:6) 0 . 6 (cid:3) M ( Fig . 6 A ) . Accordingly , 2 - AG induced a strong concentration - dependent extracellular [ 3 H ] AEA accumulation ( Fig . 6 A ) . The same experiments were carried out by adding 2 - AG in presence of 100 n M AEA , and the absolute intracellular and extracellular levels of the latter molecule were quantified by GC / MS . As shown in Fig . 6 B , 2 - AG inhibited the cell membrane movement of AEA in the same qualitative and quantitative manner as observed in the radioactivity - based experiments . At 1 (cid:3) M , 2 - AG led to (cid:7) 50 % inhibition of AEA uptake ( Fig . 6 B ) . The same co - incubation experiments were performed , applying different concentrations of AEA in presence of 1 (cid:3) M of either 2 - AG or 2 - AG / [ 3 H ] 2 - AG .

In the same graph , the AEA - induced extracellular accumulation of [ 3 H ] 2 - AG is also shown . In agreement with the kinetic experiments men - tioned above , the intracellular 2 - AG level measured by GC / MS was below the limit of detection both in vehicle - treated and AEA - co - incubated cells . At higher AEA concen - trations , the extracellular level of 2 - AG became detectable , whereas it was not measurable in the vehicle - treated cells ( Fig . 6 D ) . Collectively , these data show a competition between the two endocannabinoids for the same membrane carrier . In all of the other conditions tested , the intracellular and extracellular levels of 2 - AG were too low to be detected , probably due to the multienzymatic pathways involved in 2 - AG hydrolytic cleavage as well as the higher detection limit of 2 - AG compared with AEA ( 50 ) . We recently established a method to quantify the levels of other endogenous N - acylethanolamines , such as PEA , OEA , SEA , and LEA , by GC / MS ( 50 ) . We applied this method to investigate the AEA and 2 - AG uptake in the presence of these N - acylethanolamines . As shown in Fig . 7 , neither AEA nor 2 - AG cellular uptake was influenced by the presence of these N - acylethanolamines . This suggests that the latter lipids are not transported via the putative EMT ( Fig . 7 ) , which is in agreement with two studies showing a lack of competition between AEA and PEA ( 65 ) and between AEA or 2 - AG and SEA ( 66 ) . The absolute intracellular and extracellular levels of all N - acyletha - nolamines were quantified upon administration to the cells , either alone or together , because the latter condition more closely resembles the physiological conditions . All of the N - acylethanolamines exhibited an increase of both the intracel - lular and extracellular levels when administered simultane - ously in comparison with the single administration . Nonethe - less , the intra - / extracellular ratio did not exhibit any change ( Fig . 7 ) , suggesting that the FAAH hydrolysis rather than the movement across the cell membrane is affected . All of these fatty acid - derived N - acylethanolamines are FAAH substrates and can compete for the enzymatic hydrolysis . Again , 2 - AG was FIGURE6 .

To further explore the structural requirements of lipids that are transported via the same mechanism as AEA and 2 - AG , we next measured whether other arachidonic acid - derived endo - cannabinoids affect [ 3 H ] AEA and [ 3 H ] 2 - AG transport . As shown in Fig . 8 , A – C , NADA , virodhamine , and 2 - AGE all com - peted with the uptake of both [ 3 H ] AEA and [ 3 H ] 2 - AG with similar potencies , reducing their intracellular levels and increasing their extracellular levels . Intriguingly , this competi - tion occurred independently of the inhibition of enzymatic hydrolysis of the major endocannabinoids , as shown by the fact that all endocannabinoids inhibit both [ 3 H ] AEA and [ 3 H ] 2 - AG cellular uptake , irrespective of their FAAH and MAGL inhibi - tion activity ( for MAGL inhibition , see also below ) . We used PEA as a control to see the FAAH inhibition in this setup ( Fig . 8 D ) . As expected , 10 (cid:3) M PEA did not affect [ 3 H ] 2 - AG uptake and hydrolysis but significantly reduced [ 3 H ] AEA cellular uptake and hydrolysis by about 50 % .

As mentioned above , enzymes other than MAGL are involved in 2 - AG breakdown , and therefore the selective blockage of MAGL resulted only in a partial reduction ( 55 % ) of [ 3 H ] glycerol formation as compared with the vehicle - treated cells . The residual 2 - AG hydrolysis mainly depends on ABHD - 6 and - 12 ; in fact , the multiple inhibition of MAGL ( by 1 (cid:3) M JZL184 ) , ABHD - 6 ( WWL70 , 10 (cid:3) M ) , and ABHD - 12 ( tetrahydrolipstatin , 20 (cid:3) M ) led to an 80 % – 85 % inhibition of 2 - AG hydrolysis in U937 cell homogenate ( data not shown ) . Moreover , U937 cells and U937 macrophages showed robust mRNA expression lev - els of both ABHD - 6 and ABHD - 12 ( Fig . 9 D ) . In subsequent experiments , we combined 3 (cid:3) M UCM707 with increasing con - centrations of JZL184 ( 0 . 1 – 1000 n M ) , as performed previously with AEA . As shown in Fig . 10 A , the combination treatment reversed the intracellular accumulation of [ 3 H ] 2 - AG medi - ated by JZL184 , resulting in a significant reduction of the intracellular endocannabinoid level . The extracellular level was not significantly increased in the presence of the com - bination as compared with the JZL184 treatment alone ( Fig . 10 B ) . This lack of potentiation for the combination is in line with the negligible effect induced by 3 (cid:3) M UCM707 ( (cid:1) 105 % of control ) on extracellular [ 3 H ] 2 - AG accumulation ( see Fig . 9 A ) . The combination treatment was also carried out with the EMT inhibitor OMDM - 2 at 5 (cid:3) M combined with 1 (cid:3) M JZL184 . As shown for UCM707 , the OMDM - 2 / JZL184 com - bination induced a significant reduction of the intracellular [ 3 H ] 2 - AG accumulation as compared with JZL184 treatment alone . Unlike with UCM707 , the combination of JZL184 with OMDM - 2 led to a slight but significant increase of the extracellular endocannabinoid level . Although not under - stood at present , this is in agreement with the slight increase ( about 25 % ) of the extracellular [ 3 H ] 2 - AG induced by 5 (cid:3) M OMDM - 2 alone ( Fig . 10 , C and D ) . Likewise , the combination of UCM707 and JZL184 abolished the absolute intracellular amount of 2 - AG seen with GC / MS upon JZL184 treatment ( 80 pmol / 10 6 cells ) . In the vehicle - treated cells and the UCM707 treated cells , the 2 - AG level was below the limit of detection ( Fig . 10 E ) . The UCM707 / JZL184 FIGURE10 .

FAAH activity does not significantly contribute to the [ 3 H ] 2 - AG hydrolysis ( assessed in U937 cell homogenate ) ( Fig . 10 G ) and cellular uptake into U937 cells ( Fig . 10 H ) , as shown by blocking FAAH with 1 (cid:3) M URB597 . The Putative EMT Mediates a Bidirectional Transport of AEA and 2 - AG in U937 Cells —The release ( efflux ) mechanism of endocannabinoids is still unknown , and very few studies have addressed this issue only for AEA ( 16 , 37 – 39 ) . In order to inves - tigate the hypothesis that the same EMT is involved in both the release and uptake , we adapted a method to indirectly load the cells with [ 3 H ] AEA or [ 3 H ] 2 - AG ( see “Experimental Proce - dures” ) . In this system , we achieved an almost complete phar - macological inhibition of endocannabinoid breakdown by using a combination of URB597 and PMSF ( FAAH ) or by using JZL184 ( MAGL ) , tetrahydrolipstatin , and WWL70 ( ABHD - 6 and - 12 ) . Subsequent to inhibition of hydrolysis , cells were incubated with a mixture of “cold / hot” endocannabinoids , which accumulated intracellularly as shown before , despite the lack of the gradient generated by continuous breakdown . After - ward , the EMT inhibitors UCM707 , OMDM - 2 , and LY2183240 were applied , and the extracellular release of the preloaded [ 3 H ] AEA or [ 3 H ] 2 - AG was measured after 25 min of incubation in an endocannabinoid - free medium containing 1 % fatty acid - free BSA as an extracellular “acceptor . ” As shown in Fig . 11 , A – C , all three EMT inhibitors significantly inhibited the [ 3 H ] AEA release in a concentration - dependent manner . As expected , the EMT inhibitor - treated cells also revealed a strong increase of the cytosolic [ 3 H ] AEA level . In agreement with the cellular release of [ 3 H ] AEA shown , all three EMT inhibitors also partially inhibited the release of [ 3 H ] 2 - AG and increased its intracellular level in a concentration - de - pendent manner ( Fig . 12 , A – C ) . Importantly , all three EMT inhibitors showed a similar potency and efficacy in inhibit - ing the release of both endocannabinoids . Collectively , these results show , for the first time , that the putative EMT , as characterized by its inhibitors , is involved in the bidirec - tional movement of AEA and 2 - AG . DISCUSSION Endocannabinoids have been shown to be involved in numerous physiological and pathophysiological processes ( 1 ) . Their generation , transport , and degradation are fundamental for the functioning of the ECS . The mechanism of endocan - nabinoid movement across the cell membrane is a controversial issue , despite almost 2 decades of research activity on this topic . There are both in vitro ( 12 , 63 ) and in vivo ( 67 – 70 ) data sup - porting the existence of a putative anandamide EMT . However , other EMT - independent AEA uptake mechanisms have been proposed , such as caveolae - related endocytosis ( 27 , 71 ) and FAAH - driven facilitated diffusion ( 24 , 25 , 72 ) . More recently , different cytoplasmic AEA - binding proteins ( FABPs , Hsp70 , albumin , and FLAT ) and intracellular compartments ( adipo - somes ) have been shown to be important for the cellular uptake of AEA ( 9 , 11 , 60 , 73 ) . Because the methodology used in endo - cannabinoid cellular transport assays is fundamental for the interpretation of the data obtained , as previously pointed out ( 40 , 41 ) , we have made use of absolute quantifications of endo - cannabinoids in addition to radioligand assays ( see below ) . All of our experiments were carried out without serum in order to avoid any alteration of the actual extracellular concentration of AEA and 2 - AG ( 50 ) . By using silanized plastic tubes ( see “Experimental Procedures” ) , we were able to overcome the inherent problem of AEA and 2 - AG sticking to plastic , as pre - viously described ( 40 , 41 ) , and the total recovery of AEA and 2 - AG ( sum of extracellular and intracellular endocannabinoids and their hydrolytic products ) at the end of the experiments was always in the range of 85 – 95 % of the initial amount added to the cells ( data not shown ) . Distinct Incorporation of [ 3 H ] Ethanolamine and [ 3 H ] Glyc - erol into U937 Cell Membranes and Implications for Uptake Assays —Current methodologies applied to investigate endo - cannabinoid cell membrane transport mainly rely on the meas - urement of radiolabeled AEA , detecting the intra - and extracel - lular radioactive signal after a lipophilic / aqueous phase separation . Consequently , the position of the radioisotope in the endocannabinoid critically affects the readout . Indeed , after hydrolysis , the free arachidonate and the PL - incorporated arachidonic acid are collected within the lipophilic phase , FIGURE 11 . EMT inhibitors block [ 3 H ] AEA release from U937 cells preloaded with 100 n M [ 3 H ] AEA plus AEA . Shown are concentration - dependent intracellular [ 3 H ] AEA ( AEAintr ) accumulation and extracellular [ 3 H ] AEA released ( AEArel ) reduction after a 25 - min incubation of UCM707 ( A ) , OMDM - 2 ( B ) , or LY2183240 ( C ) in FAAH - blocked U937 cells ( obtained by cellular pretreatment with 100 n M URB597 and 1 (cid:3) M PMSF ) preloaded with 100 n M [ 3 H ] AEA plus AEA .

Bidirectional Endocannabinoid Cell Membrane Transport 34674 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 287•NUMBER 41• OCTOBER 5 , 2012 a t UG I S E R V E I D ADQU I S I C I ON S on M a r c h 4 , 2015 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m whereas the ethanolamine ( or glycerol from 2 - AG ) is recovered in the aqueous phase . Therefore , when [ ethanolamine - 1 - 3 H ] AEA is used in the presence of either FAAH or EMT inhib - itors , the intracellular radioactivity from the lipophilic phase should be differentially affected . FAAH inhibition leads to higher intracellular levels of AEA compared with vehicle - treated cells , as reported for URB597 ( 56 , 74 , 75 ) , whereas blocking the cell membrane transport leads to a reduced cellu - lar penetration of AEA , as reported for several inhibitors ( 19 – 21 ) . FAAH inhibitors can lead to different readouts , depending on many factors , such as AEA concentration , distinct incorpo - ration of ethanolamine in different cell types , and method of detection ( radioactivity versus absolute quantification ) . This could be a major explanation for the different readouts reported for FAAH inhibitors on AEA cellular uptake ( 25 , 56 , 74 , 76 ) . If FAAH is blocked , AEA is still transported inside the cell , where it segregates into cytoplasmic reservoirs , such as the recently described carrier proteins or adiposomes ( 9 – 11 , 73 ) , whereas in FAAH - active cells , AEA is rapidly hydrolyzed . Selective EMT inhibitors inhibit AEA uptake without signifi - cantly interfering with the enzymes involved in endocannabi - noid degradation ( Refs . 19 and 20 and this work ) . In our experiments , we incubated U937 cells with [ ethanolamine - 1 - 3 H ] AEA , finding a similar reduction of the cytosolic radio - activity signal by pretreating the cells with either URB597 , PMSF , or OMDM - 2 and UCM707 . On the contrary , when the same experiments were carried out measuring the absolute intra - and extracellular endocannabinoid levels in a radiolabel - free assay , the EMT inhibition led to a decreased cytoplasmic AEA level , whereas inhibition of FAAH led to intracellular accumulation . The discrepancy between the two experimental settings was explained upon performing TLC analyses , showing that PE - incorporated [ 3 H ] ethanolamine is the major source ( 74 . 9 % ) of the intracellular radioactivity signal in the vehicle - treated cells . Importantly , this leads to an overestimation of the cytoplasmic [ 3 H ] AEA level . The arachidonic acid derived from AEA hydrolysis was shown to be almost completely incorpo - rated into PLs in both rodent cancer cells and primary cortical neurons ( 17 , 18 ) , whereas on the contrary , the ethanolamine was not found in PLs after 5 min of incubation with [ 3 H ] AEA in RBL - 2H3 rat basophilic leukemia cells ( 25 ) or only partially incorporated into primary cortical rat neurons ( 17 ) . Ethanola - mine is involved in different cellular processes , and it is essen - tial for biosynthesis of the most abundant phospholipids , phos - phatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine ( 77 ) . The ethanolamine PL incorporation is a well known multistep path - way ( see supplemental Fig . 1 ) that initiates with the ethanola - mine phosphorylation , catalyzed by choline or ethanolamine kinases , two soluble cytoplasmic enzymes . Subsequently , phos - phoethanolamine reacts with CTP to generate CDP - ethanola - mine , which in turn is condensed with 1 , 2 - diacylglycerol to produce PE via the enzymatic activity of the ER - expressed CDP - ethanolamine : diacylglycerol ethanolamine phospho - transferase ( 78 ) . AEA hydrolysis occurs mainly at the ER level , where FAAH is primarily expressed and where the rate - limiting step of the PE biosynthesis takes place . AEA - generated [ 3 H ] ethanolamine is included in the cytosolic pool of ethanol - amine and fed to the PL biosynthesis . This constitutive incor - poration of [ 3 H ] ethanolamine can directly impact the readout of the [ 3 H ] AEA uptake assay . Although a former study ruled out a significant PL incorporation of [ 3 H ] ethanolamine in RBL - 2H3 ( 25 ) , most of the studies on AEA uptake have been per - formed using cancer cell lines that have been shown to possess a high activity of the PL biosynthesis pathway due their rapid and unlimited proliferation rate ( 18 ) . In fact , choline kinase has been reported to be overexpressed in many cancer types , where it promotes proliferation ( 79 ) . In the present study , we show that the human U937 monocyte leukemia cells retain the vast majority of the AEA - derived [ 3 H ] ethanolamine in PLs within 5 min due to the high rate of PL biosynthesis in this cell line ( 80 ) . Importantly , the non - proliferating PMA - differentiated U937 macrophages negligibly incorporate ethanolamine . Similarly , RBL - 2H3 cells probably possess a lower rate of PLs biosynthe - sis , which would explain the difference observed in ethanola - mine incorporation . Unlike ethanolamine , [ 3 H ] glycerol gener - ated upon 2 - AG hydrolysis has a different intracellular fate because it is only poorly incorporated into PLs ( 0 . 2 % ) . Glycerol is the backbone of glycerophospholipids , the most abundant class of lipids in mammalian cells . Its biosynthesis takes place in the ER , and it is initiated by the acylation of glycerol 3 - phos - phate to form phosphatidic acid , which represents the common precursor for all of the other glycerophospholipids ( 77 ) .

Bidirectional Endocannabinoid Cell Membrane Transport OCTOBER 5 , 2012• VOLUME 287•NUMBER 41 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 34675 a t UG I S E R V E I D ADQU I S I C I ON S on M a r c h 4 , 2015 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m [ 3 H ] Glycerol formation occurs at the cell membrane , where the 2 - AG hydrolytic enzymes MAGL , ABHD - 6 , and ABHD - 12 are located ( 58 , 59 ) . According to the MAGL crystal structure , glyc - erol can leave the catalytic site via a specific exit channel ( 81 ) and freely diffuse throughout the cell membrane , despite its hydrophilic nature . This can happen thanks to the aquaglycero - porins ( AQPs ) , a class of transmembrane water channels , which are also permeable to glycerol ( 82 ) . Recently , the expression of two aquaglyceroporin members , AQP3 and AQP9 , has been identified in macrophages ( 83 , 84 ) . Therefore , [ 3 H ] glycerol formed upon 2 - AG cleavage is unlikely to enter the intracellular pool available for glycerophospholipid biosynthesis . Independent Interaction between FAAH Inhibitors and EMT Inhibitors upon AEA Uptake —The main indirect proof for the existence of the EMT was obtained by treating cells with differ - ent inhibitors of cellular uptake of AEA at concentrations at which they do not interact with FAAH ( 19 – 21 ) . Moreover , in the literature , there is some evidence against the causal rela - tionship between the inhibition of AEA degradation and the inhibition of cellular uptake . Centonze et al . ( 85 ) showed that two natural products , quinpirole and cocaine , act as FAAH inhibitors in corticostriatal slices without affecting AEA uptake in corticostriatal synaptosomes . Furthermore , inhibition of AEA uptake independent of FAAH inhibition has been reported to produce a variety of in vivo effects , including anti - nociception , in animal models of neuropathic pain ( 67 – 70 ) . Here we show that the combination treatment of an EMT inhibitor ( UCM707 or OMDM - 2 ) at low and FAAH - ineffective concentrations with the selective FAAH inhibitor URB597 or the nonspecific hydrolase inhibitor PMSF results in a functional synergism on the AEA uptake inhibition , in agreement with an independent interaction between the two classes of inhibitors ( 46 – 48 ) . The weak FAAH inhibition by low concentrations of inhibitors could be amplified by increased EMT activity due to CB 1 receptor stimulation . Several papers have suggested a reg - ulatory loop between CB 1 receptors and EMT , where receptor activation triggers a higher EMT activity ( 86 , 87 ) . Maccarrone et al . ( 86 ) reported a NO - mediated link between CB 1 and EMT in endothelial cells , and Ortega - Gutie´rrez et al . ( 87 ) showed a SR141716A - sensitive contribution of AEA uptake into neuro - nal cortical cells obtained from both FAAH (cid:3) / (cid:3) and FAAH (cid:5) / (cid:5) mice . In this study , the increased amount of extracellular AEA triggered by the EMT inhibitors might activate CB 1 receptors , which are expressed on the cell surface of the U937 clone we used ( data not shown ) ( 88 , 89 ) . FAAH inhibition by the EMT inhibitors can be ruled out because we chose concentrations at which UCM707 ( 1 (cid:3) M ) and OMDM - 2 ( 5 (cid:3) M ) do not inhibit FAAH ( 19 , 20 ) , which was confirmed by us in two different experiments , including U937 cell homogenate . The results on the combination effects of EMT and FAAH inhibitors , reported here for the first time , show an independent interaction based on the activity on two different targets ( i . e . FAAH and EMT ) . The EMT and Cytoplasmic AEA - binding Proteins Are Differ - ent Players in the AEA Uptake Process —Two recent papers have reported the binding of several EMT inhibitors to FAPB5 and FLAT in the micromolar range ( 11 , 61 ) . In addition , UCM707 at 20 (cid:3) M was shown to inhibit AEA accumulation in FLAT - ex - pressing HEK293 cells ( 11 ) , whereas OMDM - 2 at 10 (cid:3) M par - tially reduced AEA uptake in FAAH - transfected HeLa cells , probably competing with AEA for FABP5 binding ( 61 ) . Although in our experiments we applied these two EMT inhib - itors at significantly lower concentrations ( 5 – 10 times ) , a potential weak interaction with FABPs and FLAT ( if present in cells ) cannot be completely ruled out . Independent groups have identified different intracellular carrier proteins , such as FABPs , FLAT , albumin , and Hsp70 , which were collectively named AIBPs ( 60 ) , which shuttle AEA within the cytosol to different intracellular compartments and targets ( 9 – 11 , 60 , 61 ) . Although AIPBs certainly play an important role in cellular AEA uptake , these recent reports indicate that carrier proteins are crucially involved in the complex AEA trafficking process without ruling out an EMT - mediated uptake step . Indeed , Fu et al . ( 11 ) showed that FLAT specifically binds AEA and not 2 - AG , and Oddi et al . ( 10 ) reported the same for albumin and Hsp70 . However , our data clearly indicate that the cellular uptake process of AEA and 2 - AG occurs via the same mecha - nism . Furthermore , Fu et al . ( 11 ) described some other intrigu - ing findings in favor of the existence of an EMT . They showed the trend of the EMT inhibitors UCM707 and VDM11 to inhibit AEA uptake in FLAT - transfected HEK293 cells more strongly than in the vector - transfected cells ( 11 ) . HEK293 cells have been shown to possess the EMT ( although with a lower V max value than U937 cells ) and almost completely lack FAAH activity ( 16 , 90 , 91 ) . Therefore , the additional AEA uptake inhi - bition by UCM707 and VDM11 in FLAT - transfected cells over mock - transfected cells may be a combination of separate effects on FLAT and EMT . This hypothesis is supported by the inabil - ity of the specific FLAT inhibitor ARN272 to produce any addi - tional reduction of AEA uptake in FLAT - transfected cells . Fur - thermore , the accumulation of intracellular AEA after 5 min of incubation in neurons isolated from FAAH / FLAT - deficient mouse brain is almost half of the AEA level found in neurons isolated from wild type mice , suggesting that these cells exploit other transport mechanisms in addition to FAAH / FLAT for AEA uptake . Finally , Fu et al . ( 11 ) also identified a role of FLAT in the release of AEA . In the culture medium obtained from Neuro - 2a FLAT - transfected cells , a significantly higher amount of AEA was found in vector - transfected cells ( 11 ) . Importantly , FLAT expression did not induce any effect on 2 - AG , whereas we report a role of the EMT in the release of both endocannabinoids . Two recent papers ( 9 , 61 ) identified different FABPs as intracellular AEA carrier proteins , describ - ing their involvement in the AEA uptake process in both COS - 7 transfected cells and the endogenously FABP - expressing HeLa cells ( 61 ) . Interestingly , the specific FABPs inhibitor BMS309403 has been shown to only partially reduce the AEA uptake in FABP - transfected COS - 7 and N18TG2 cells at con - centrations higher than 20 and 50 (cid:3) M , respectively ( although the reported K i is in the nanomolar range ( 62 ) ) . In HeLa cells , both the pharmacological and genetic inhibition of FABPs led to a partial inhibition of the nuclear PPAR (cid:1) activation triggered by OEA and GW747 ( two PPAR agonists ) , thus confirming the intracellular shuttling role of FABPs for these compounds . However , the authors did not show the role of FABPs in AEA - triggered PPAR (cid:1) activation . Furthermore , the authors showed a partial reduction of AEA uptake in FAAH - transfected HeLa Bidirectional Endocannabinoid Cell Membrane Transport 34676 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 287•NUMBER 41• OCTOBER 5 , 2012 a t UG I S E R V E I D ADQU I S I C I ON S on M a r c h 4 , 2015 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m cells that was lost in FABP - deficient cells , which led them to hypothesize that these proteins are the main target of the EMT inhibitors used . In this study , we evaluated the potency of AEA uptake inhibition by UCM707 and OMDM - 2 using U937 cells and U937 macrophages , which have recently been shown to differentially express FABPs ( 44 ) . The authors monitored changes in the proteome in monocyte - like U937 cells and upon stimulation with PMA ( macrophage - like phenotype ) . In U937 macrophages , the levels of FABP5 increase about 4 - fold , and FABP4 levels increase dramatically because they are not expressed or are very weakly expressed in U937 cells ( 44 ) . In our study , we made use of this finding and employed the nonspe - cific FABP inhibitor BMS309403 to inhibit AEA uptake . We obtained a 10 - fold lower IC 50 value for AEA uptake inhibition in FABP - expressing cells ( U937 macrophages ) compared with the non - expressing cells ( U937 cells ) . However , UCM707 and OMDM - 2 inhibited AEA uptake in both cell types with the same potency , independent of FABP expression . This finding confirms the involvement of FABPs in the intracellular traffick - ing of AEA but also clearly refutes the hypothesis that these carrier proteins are the main target of EMT inhibitors . The inhibition of AEA uptake in FAAH - transfected HeLa cells shown by Kaczocha et al . ( 61 ) could be derived from a partial FAAH inhibition rather than the exclusive interaction with FABPs , due to the high EMT inhibitor concentrations applied . On the other hand , the loss of AEA uptake in FABP - deficient cells could be the consequence of the disruption of the AEA movement toward the ER , reflecting the participation of FABPs in AEA intracellular trafficking . Although FABPs have been proposed to possess promiscuous binding pockets for several endocannabinoid - like molecules , 2 - AG binding has not been shown so far ( 61 ) . Another major concern about the specificity of the uptake inhibitors toward the EMT over other ECS targets , such as intracellular carriers and FAAH , is related to the kinetics of cellular AEA uptake . Some studies report that uptake inhibition occurs only at late time points ( i . e . later than 90 s of incubation ) ( 24 , 25 ) , whereas most of the measurements on cellular AEA uptake have been carried out after 4 – 10 min of incubation , thus raising the question of the role of downstream targets in the AEA uptake inhibition ( 12 ) . In our hands , the inhibition of [ 3 H ] AEA cellular uptake by UCM707 and OMDM - 2 was iden - tical from 30 s to 10 min , accounting for a very fast and constant transport process mediated by a cell membrane target rather than intracellular targets . Furthermore , the EMT inhibitor con - centrations applied were significantly lower than the ones required for FAAH inhibition ( Refs . 19 and 20 and this work ) or AIBP binding ( 11 , 61 ) . Evidence That AEA and 2 - AG Share a Common Membrane Transport Mechanism —Our results clearly point out that the EMT is a membrane transporter for both AEA and 2 - AG . How - ever , intracellular carriers have so far only been identified for AEA ( 9 – 11 ) , and unlike with AEA , relatively little is known about the trafficking of 2 - AG across the cellular membrane ( 28 ) . A few studies have reported 2 - AG uptake via a protein - facilitated mechanism that is shared by AEA ( 29 – 32 ) . 2 - AG was shown to inhibit AEA uptake in C6 rat glioma cells with an IC 50 value of 4 . 6 (cid:3) M , whereas , in the same setting , AEA was not able to significantly modulate 2 - AG uptake at 20 - fold higher concentrations ( 31 ) . Similarly , the competitive effect of 2 - AG on cellular AEA uptake has been described with similar potency in RBL - 2H3 rat basophilic leukemia cells ( 92 ) and Neuro - 2a mouse neuroblastoma cells ( 65 ) , as well as in granule and astro - cytoma cells ( 33 , 93 ) . In addition , several papers ( 30 – 35 , 39 , 64 ) have reported 2 - AG uptake to possess the typical characteris - tics of a carrier - mediated transport , such as time and tempera - ture dependence , saturability , and sensitivity to the nonspecific AEA transport inhibitor AM404 in different cell lines . Despite these results , it is still debated whether the same putative trans - porter is responsible for both AEA and 2 - AG uptake because only 2 - AG was shown to inhibit AEA trafficking at physiologi - cal concentration ratios between the two endocannabinoids ( 31 ) . To our knowledge , so far only two EMT inhibitors have been tested on 2 - AG uptake , namely AM404 ( 30 , 31 , 35 ) and its 2 - methylphenyl derivative , VDM11 ( 34 ) . At 10 (cid:3) M , both com - pounds inhibit cellular 2 - AG uptake , but both compounds also target other proteins , such as the transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 ( TRPV1 ) ( 94 ) , membrane channels ( 95 – 97 ) , FLAT ( 11 ) , FAPBs ( 61 ) , FAAH ( 93 ) , MAGL ( 98 ) , and others ( 99 ) . Other researchers did not report any interplay between cellular AEA and 2 - AG uptake but suggested that the latter is mediated either via a passive diffusion process ( 29 , 100 ) or by a specific transporter ( different from AEA ) . All of the experi - ments carried out so far relied on the radiolabeled 2 - AG , with - out quantifying the absolute amounts of the endocannabinoid intra - and extracellularly . Exact assay conditions ( i . e . low endo - cannabinoid concentrations and short incubation times ) and controls ( unambiguous signal detection ) seem mandatory to be able to measure endocannabinoid membrane transport . Here we clearly show a reciprocal competition between AEA and 2 - AG membrane trafficking at physiological concentration ratios ( 2 - AG up to 50 times higher than AEA and AEA up to 5 times higher than 2 - AG ( 101 ) ) . In particular , 2 - AG inhibited AEA uptake at a 10 : 1 concentration ratio , whereas AEA elicited the same effect at a 5 : 1 concentration ratio . Although the two endocannabinoids mutually inhibited their uptake at physio - logical concentration ratios , an estimated factor 2 of difference in favor of AEA was recognized , supporting a higher affinity of AEA toward the EMT . Furthermore , both UCM707 and OMDM - 2 inhibited 2 - AG uptake with IC 50 values similar to AEA uptake inhibition . In agreement with the absence of [ 3 H ] glycerol incorporation into PLs , the effect of JZL184 was a concentration - dependent increase of the intracellular 2 - AG level . When UCM707 was combined with increasing concen - trations of JZL184 , the intracellular accumulation of 2 - AG was inhibited , implying that less 2 - AG can enter the cells . Unlike for AEA , both EMT inhibitors did not lead to an increase of the 2 - AG extracellular level and to a reduction of the glycerol for - mation . This difference can be explained by the more complex degrading machinery involved in 2 - AG breakdown , which involves at least three distinct enzymes located in the cell mem - brane . In addition to MAGL ( 81 , 102 ) , which is usually found associated with the inner cell membrane leaflet , two other hydrolyzes have been recently identified to hydrolyze 2 - AG , ABHD - 6 and - 12 . It is noteworthy that these enzymes are inte - gral cell membrane proteins that have been suggested to share Bidirectional Endocannabinoid Cell Membrane Transport OCTOBER 5 , 2012• VOLUME 287•NUMBER 41 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 34677 a t UG I S E R V E I D ADQU I S I C I ON S on M a r c h 4 , 2015 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m the catalytic triad with MAGL ( 8 ) . ABHD - 6 has been proposed to face the catalytic site intracellularly and ABHD - 12 extracel - lularly ( 58 , 59 ) . The physiological relevance of this redundancy of 2 - AG breakdown is still being investigated , but it appears completely different from AEA , whose enzymatic inactivation is primarily mediated by the ER - located FAAH ( 3 ) . Therefore , in our system , the extracellular accumulation of 2 - AG is prob - ably lowered by the hydrolytic activity of ABHDs , as suggested also by the higher levels of glycerol formation . Although these enzymes have so far been identified only in the brain and in neuronal cell lines , a recent study showed a high expression of both ABHDs in mouse macrophages ( 103 ) . In agreement , we show that ABHD - 6 and ABHD - 12 transcripts are expressed in both U937 cells and U937 macrophages . Toward a Common Membrane Transport Mechanism for Arachidonoyl Chain Harboring Endocannabinoids —We found that the N - acylethanolamines PEA , OEA , LEA , and SEA , which have been reported to be co - released with the endocannabinoid AEA upon cellular stimulation , did not influence the uptake of AEA and 2 - AG . The cellular uptake of PEA and SEA has already been shown to be independent from cellular AEA uptake ( 65 , 66 ) . We show that the three additional arachidonoyl chain - containing endocannabinoids ( eicosanoids ) , NADA , virod - hamine , and noladin ether , compete with the uptake of AEA and 2 - AG in U937 cells , independent of their ability to inhibit FAAH and MAGL . NADA has previously been shown to inhibit [ 14 C ] AEA uptake in RBL - 2H3 and C6 glioma cells with IC 50 values of 21 . 5 and 17 . 5 (cid:3) M , respectively ( 104 ) and to inhibit FAAH ( IC 50 values of 22 . 0 and 23 . 0 (cid:3) M in N18TG2 cells and RBL - 2H3 cells , respectively ) ( 104 ) and MAGL ( IC 50 value of 0 . 78 (cid:3) M in rat cerebellar homogenate ) ( 98 ) . Conversely , noladin ether was shown to inhibit [ 14 C ] AEA and [ 3 H ] 2 - AG uptake in C6 glioma cells with IC 50 values of 15 . 6 and 22 . 7 (cid:3) M , respec - tively ( 105 ) and to inhibit FAAH with an IC 50 value of 3 (cid:3) M in rat cerebellar homogenate without significantly inhibiting MAGL ( IC 50 36 (cid:3) M in rat cerebellar homogenate ) ( 106 ) . To date , little is known about virodhamine . In agreement with our finding , it has been found to inhibit [ 14 C ] AEA uptake with a relatively high IC 50 value ( 123 (cid:3) M ) in RBL - 2H3 cells ( 107 ) . It must be considered that different cells may express the putative EMT to different degrees , and depending on the amount of AEA added in each assay , also passive diffusion and FABPs could play a role . Our observation that arachidonoyl chain - containing endocannabinoids compete for the cellular uptake of [ 3 H ] AEA and [ 3 H ] 2 - AG but not other N - acylethanolamines suggests a common membrane transport mechanism for endo - cannabinoids , pinpointing the importance of the arachidonoyl moiety for competition . This is in agreement with a previous conclusion on the importance of the arachidonoyl moiety for AEA transport inhibitors ( 73 , 108 ) . Evidence for the Involvement of the EMT in the Cellular Release of AEA and 2 - AG —A pivotal characteristic for an ener - gy - independent carrier - mediated transporter is the bidirec - tional shuttling of the substrate across the cell membrane , depending on the concentration gradient . Only very few papers have addressed this issue with AEA transport . Ligresti et al . ( 16 ) showed a reduction of AEA release upon thapsigargin stimula - tion in HEK293 cells and in dorsal root ganglion neurons when preincubated with 4 (cid:3) M VDM11 . In another experiment , Mac - carrone et al . ( 37 ) reported a similar inhibition of release of preloaded [ 3 H ] AEA from HUVEC cells when preincubated with 10 (cid:3) M AM404 . In the same article , the trans - effect of flux coupling has also been reported , measuring accumulation of [ 3 H ] AEA added to HUVEC cells preloaded with 100 (cid:3) M “cold” AEA ( 37 ) . Similarly , a time - and temperature - dependent AEA efflux was shown in cerebellar granule cells preloaded with radiolabeled [ 3 H ] AEA ( 38 ) . In the same cells , Hillard and Jarra - hian ( 39 ) demonstrated that the transcellular movement of AEA exhibits the trans - effect of flux coupling . Our results now demonstrate that all of the three inhibitors tested , UCM707 , OMDM - 2 , and LY2183240 , produced a concentration - depen - dent reduction of the endocannabinoid release coupled with an increase of the intracellular levels . We therefore not only con - firmed the presence of a carrier - mediated bidirectional [ 3 H ] AEA movement across the cell membrane but also show that structurally unrelated inhibitors of AEA cellular uptake partially block [ 3 H ] AEA . The maximal inhibition of [ 3 H ] AEA release was in the range of 20 – 40 % , whereas its intracellular level increased by 50 – 80 % . This difference could be explained by the presence of different intracellular storage compartments that remove [ 3 H ] AEA from the cytosolic pool , which is released following an outward concentration gradient . To our knowl - edge , there is so far no literature addressing the mechanism involved in 2 - AG release . Therefore , we have applied the same methodology to assess 2 - AG cellular efflux in U937 cells , using a combination of inhibitors of 2 - AG degradation ( JZL184 for MAGL ( 109 ) , WWL70 for ABHD - 6 ( 110 ) , and tetrahydrolip - statin for ABHD - 12 ( 8 ) ) . Tetrahydrolipstatin also inhibits dia - cylglycerol lipase ( the main enzyme involved in the 2 - AG bio - synthesis ) with a higher potency than for ABHD - 12 ( 111 ) . Thus , at the concentration used in our assay , a potential de novo synthesis of 2 - AG can be excluded . By using this method , we were able , for the first time , to show that the same small mole - cule inhibitors that lead to a reduction of AEA and 2 - AG uptake are also able to inhibit the release of both endocannabinoids , resulting in a parallel increase of their intracellular levels . Because the mechanism of endocannabinoid release has not yet been elucidated , our consistent evidence for the bidirectionality of the putative EMT may provide the basis for future research . Our findings further suggest several intriguing physiological scenarios as it has more recently become evident that endocan - nabinoids have several intracellular targets , including nuclear PPARs , the membrane TRPV channels , and intracellular can - nabinoid receptors ( 112 , 113 ) . Along this line , a recent study identified and characterized the presence of functional CB 1 receptors on the mitochondria ( mtCB1 ) in mice hippocampal neurons ( 113 ) . Furthermore , for 2 - AG a novel positive allos - teric GABA A receptor binding site at the inner leaflet of the cell membrane has been identified ( 114 ) . Altogether , our findings suggest that the putative EMT may be the only common target between AEA and 2 - AG in the traf - ficking and metabolism pathways . While AEA binds to AIPBs and is shuttled to several intracellular sites , such as the inner cell membrane leaflet ( TRPV1 ) , nuclear membrane ( PPARs ) , ER ( FAAH - 1 ) , and adiposomes ( FAAH - 2 ) , to date no intracel - lular carrier proteins have been shown to bind and / or shuttle Bidirectional Endocannabinoid Cell Membrane Transport 34678 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 287•NUMBER 41• OCTOBER 5 , 2012 a t UG I S E R V E I D ADQU I S I C I ON S on M a r c h 4 , 2015 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m 2 - AG . Furthermore , AEA is primarily hydrolyzed by the ER - lo - cated FAAH , whereas 2 - AG breakdown occurs at the cell mem - brane , where MAGL and the newly identified integral ABHD enzymes are located . Unlike FAAH or MAGL inhibitors , endo - cannabinoid membrane transport inhibitors could shift the endocannabinoid response toward either extracellular or intra - cellular targets , depending on the overall expression context . The latter possibility seems to be quite appealing in the light of the pleiotropic effects triggered by AEA through interaction with intracellular targets , such as inflammation modulation ( PPARs ) and nociception ( TRPV1 ) . In conclusion , our data provide new evidence in favor of a common cell membrane - associated mechanism for the cellular release and uptake of the major endocannabinoids in U937 cells . Specific inhibitors for this endocannabinoid cell membrane transport mechanism hold great potential as novel modulators of the ECS , which probably modulate endocannabinoid action differently from inhibitors of FAAH and MAGL .
