Tran 3 , Marc Ferrer 2 & David B . Sacks 1 * The small GTPase Cdc42 is an integral component of the cytoskeleton , and its dysregulation leads to pathophysiological conditions , such as cancer . Binding of Cdc42 to the scaffold protein IQGAP1 stabilizes Cdc42 in its active form . The interaction between Cdc42 and IQGAP1 enhances migration and invasion of cancer cells . Disrupting this association could impair neoplastic progression and metastasis ; however , no effective means to achieve this has been described . Here , we screened 78 , 500 compounds using a homogeneous time resolved fluorescence‑based assay to identify small molecules that disrupt the binding of Cdc42 to IQGAP1 . From the combined results of the validation assay and counter‑screens , we selected 44 potent compounds for cell‑based experiments . Immunoprecipitation and cell viability analysis rendered four lead compounds , namely NCGC00131308 , NCGC00098561 , MLS000332963 and NCGC00138812 , three of which inhibited proliferation and migration of breast carcinoma cells . Microscale thermophoresis revealed that two compounds bind directly to Cdc42 . One compound reduced the amount of active Cdc42 in cells and effectively impaired filopodia formation . Docking analysis provided plausible models of the compounds binding to the hydrophobic pocket adjacent to the GTP binding site of Cdc42 . In conclusion , we identified small molecules that inhibit binding between Cdc42 and IQGAP1 , which could potentially yield chemotherapeutic agents . The 189 - kDa scaffold protein , IQGAP1 , contains several protein - interaction domains , namely a calponin homol - ogy domain ( CHD ) , a polyproline - binding ( WW ) domain , four calmodulin - binding IQ motifs ( IQ ) , and a Ras - GAP - related domain ( GRD ) 1 , 2 . The multiple domains of IQGAP1 enable it to interact with a wide variety of signaling and structural proteins , such as actin , calmodulin , members of the Rho GTPase family ( e . g . Rac1 and Cdc42 ) , β - catenin , components of the phosphoinositide 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) / AKT pathway , and adenomatous poly - posis coli 2 , 3 . Through its plethora of binding partners , IQGAP1 regulates multiple fundamental cellular processes , including cytoskeletal organization , cell – cell adhesion , cell migration , transcription , and signal transduction 2 , 4 . The contribution of IQGAP1 - mediated signaling to different stages of cancer progression is an emerging field 2 , 5 . IQGAP1 is overexpressed in numerous human cancer cell lines and tissues 5 . We previously documented that overexpression of IQGAP1 in human breast epithelial cells enhances tumor proliferation , invasion , and angiogenesis 6 . IQGAP1 is an oncogene that is not required for cell homeostasis 7 , making it an attractive molecule for the development of targeted therapies . Published data imply that the interaction of IQGAP1 with selected binding partners can be specifically targeted to attenuate neoplastic processes . For example , treatment of mice with cell - permeable peptides that disrupt IQGAP1 - extracellular signal regulated kinase ( ERK ) 1 / 2 interactions inhibit Ras driven tumorigenesis 8 . Cdc42 is among the best characterized IQGAP1 binding partners 2 . Cdc42 is a Rho GTPase that is impor - tant for neoplastic transformation of cells by Ras and other oncoproteins 9 .

Guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) promote the exchange of GDP for GTP , whereas GTPase activating proteins ( GAPs ) enhance the intrinsic GTPase activ - ity of the small G proteins , promoting hydrolysis of the bound GTP . Importantly , IQGAP1 does not have GAP activity 11 . Instead , when IQGAP1 binds to the GTP - bound ( active ) form of Cdc42 , it inhibits Cdc42 intrinsic GTPase activity , keeping Cdc42 active 12 , 13 . A constitutively active Cdc42 mutant construct , termed Cdc42 - Q61L , binds IQGAP1with high affinity 14 . In contrast , when amino acid residue N17 in Cdc42 is mutated , the construct fails to bind to many Cdc42 binding partners , including IQGAP1 14 . Cdc42 is not mutated in cancers ; instead , dysregulation of Cdc42 functions contribute to carcinogenesis 9 . Increased levels of active Cdc42 directly impact actin cytoskeletal dynamics and filopodia formation 15 , 16 , which are crucial for cell migration , adhesion and responses to external stimuli 17 . Importantly , overexpression of IQGAP1 increases the pool of active Cdc42 in the cells , while knockdown of endogenous IQGAP1 decreases the amount of active Cdc42 13 . Moreover , Cdc42 is an important component of IQGAP1 - mediated cell prolifera - tion , tumorigenesis , and invasion 6 . Therefore , blocking the formation of IQGAP1 / Cdc42 complexes using small molecule inhibitors could reduce the amount of active Cdc42 in malignant cells , thus reducing tumorigenesis . In this study , we used a high throughput screening ( HTS ) approach to identify small molecules that interfere with IQGAP1 / Cdc42 interactions . We screened approximately 78 , 500 small molecules using a homogeneous time resolved fluorescence ( HTRF ) assay and identified four compounds that interfere with IQGAP1 / Cdc42 interactions and can potentially be used in targeted therapies . Results Development of the HTRF assay . In order to identify compounds that disrupt the interaction between IQGAP1 and Cdc42 , we developed a HTRF - based assay and adapted it to a 1536 - well plate format to enable HTS . We used the glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) - tagged C - terminal half ( amino acids 864 – 1657 ) of IQGAP1 ( Fig . 1a ) and hexa - histidine ( His ) - tagged Cdc42 - Q61L , because of their high binding affinity . We previously reported that constitutively active Cdc42 - Q61L binds to this fragment of IQGAP1 with an equilibrium dissociation constant ( K d ) of 24 ± 4 nM measured by scintillation proximity assay 14 . In agreement with our previous observations 14 , analysis by GST pulldown and Western blotting revealed that Cdc42 - Q61L binds to the C - terminal region of IQGAP1 ( Fig . 1b ) . In contrast , dominant negative Cdc42 - N17 has no detectable binding to IQGAP1 ( Fig . 1b ) . In the HTRF assay , the binding of Cdc42 to IQGAP1 was detected using anti - 6xHis - XL665 and anti - GST - cryptate antibodies . When Cdc42 - Q61L is bound to IQGAP1 - C , the corresponding antibodies come into close proximity , initiating energy transfer between the long - life fluorescent Europium 3 + cryptate donor and the XL665 acceptor ( Fig . 1c ) . The energy is emitted as a detectable fluorescent signal at d a N17 Q61L Cdc42 : Buffer 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 GST GST - IQGAP1 - C IQGAP1 - C His - Cdc42 N17 Q61L Q61L b His 330 nm IQGAP1 - C Cdc42 GST XL665 620 nm small molecule inhibitor 665 nm 330 nm energy transfer IQGAP1 - C Cdc42 GST His XL665 small molecule inhibitor K d ~ 24 nM c IQGAP1 - C 864 – 1657 CHD WW IQ GRD RGCT N C 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 ( 665 / 615 ) x 10 4 Figure 1 .

( b ) GST pull - down assay . GST - IQGAP1 - C was incubated with His - tagged Cdc42 - N17 or Cdc42 - Q61L for 2 h at 4 °C . GST alone was incubated with Cdc42 - Q61L as the negative control . Complexes were isolated using glutathione - Sepharose and resolved by SDS - PAGE . The gel was cut at 70 kDa . The upper part of the gel was stained with Coomassie blue . The lower portion of the gel was transferred to PVDF membrane and probed with anti - Cdc42 antibodies .

When a molecule interrupts the binding , the proximity of antibodies will not be adequate to produce energy transfer , and the signal will be reduced or absent , resulting in a diminished fluorescent signal ( Fig . 1c ) . We initially evaluated the HTRF assay in 384 - well - plate format and used Cdc42 - N17 as the negative control . A robust fluorescence signal was detected when IQGAP1 - C was incubated with Cdc42 - Q61L ( Fig . 1d ) . By contrast , when IQGAP1 - C was incubated with Cdc42 - N17 , the fluorescence was minimal , essentially the same as that observed in the absence of Cdc42 - Q61L ( IQGAP1 only samples ) . These data validate that we can detect a specific interaction between Cdc42 and IQGAP1 in a multiwell plate format , enabling us to use this assay to screen for small molecule inhibitors by HTRF . The assay was miniaturized and optimized to a 1536 - well - plate format ( see Methods for details ) . Then , the Library of Pharmacologically Active Compounds ( LOPAC® 1280 , Sigma Aldrich ) collection was screened in dose response to evaluate the robustness of the assay in a screening format and in the presence of compounds . The compounds were tested at seven concentrations . The final concentrations of the compounds in the assay ranged from 38 µM to 3 . 6 nM . HTRF signals in the presence of DMSO and 1 . 5 nM IQGAP1 protein alone were collected for each plate and set as IC 0 and IC 100 , respectively . The median assay parameters were 7 . 1 - fold signal - to - background ratio ( S / B ) and 0 . 87 Z’ - factor , indicating a robust assay performance amenable to HTS . We conducted a DMSO tolerability assay using 4 % DMSO to assess the potential effect of DMSO on the HTRF signal . The data confirmed that DMSO alone does not alter the HTRF signal ( See Supplementary Fig . S1 online ) . High throughput screening and counter‑screens . We screened approximately 78 , 500 small molecules using the primary HTRF assay ( Fig . 2 ) . Each compound was tested at four doses , with concentrations ranging from 38 µM to 305 nM . Primary hits were selected based on the following criteria : ( 1 ) maximum response > 30 % of the signal on the scale between vehicle control DMSO ( IC 0 ) and GST - IQGAP1 - C only as maximal potential inhibition ( IC 100 ) , ( 2 ) inactivity in the cryptate donor channel ( i . e . , no fluorescence ) and ( 3 ) lack of promiscuous and / or undesirable chemical structure ( dopamine - like , quinolone - like , thiourea , etc . ) . Based on these criteria , 439 compounds were selected for further analysis ( Fig . 2 ) . The compounds were re - tested in the same primary HTRF IQGAP1 - Cdc42 binding assay at seven doses , in the concentration range of 38 μM to 50 nM . One hundred and ninety - eight ( ~ 45 % ) of the 439 primary hits were confirmed in the validation screening . Conceivably , some of the compounds identified in the HTRF assay could be artifacts , i . e . , compounds that interfere with the HTRF assay technology or antibody - tag binding . To eliminate these false positives , we tested the compounds in two different HTRF counter - screens . The counter - screens were similar to the primary HTRF assay , but instead of the GST - IQGAP1 and His - Cdc42 proteins , a hexa - histidine tagged GST ( His - GST ) or a ~ 78 , 500 compounds screened in primary biochemical HTRF IQGAP1 - CDC42 binding assay 439 compounds selected based on following criteria : • Max Response > 30 % in acceptor AND inactive in donor channels • Non - promiscuous activity • Exclusion of undesirable chemical structures Follow - up HTRF binding assay : 198 ( 45 % ) confirmed His - tagged GST HTRF counter - screen His and GST tagged Cdc42 HTRF counter - screen 44 selected for orthogonal assays Immunoprecipitation of endogenous proteins from cell lysates 3 selected for cell proliferation and migration assays in MCF7 and MDA - MB - 231 breast cancer cells Cytotoxicity assay with IQGAP1 - null and control MCF7 cells Target engagement by MST Figure 2 .

Ninety - nine compounds were identified as false positives based on these counter - screens . Interestingly , some of the compounds did not show any activity in the His - GST counter - screen but were active in the counter - screen with the double - tagged Cdc42 - Q61L . Evaluation of the hit compounds in orthogonal assays . Based on the validation and counter screen - ing data , we selected 44 compounds using compound dose response curve algorithms developed at NCATS 18 for orthogonal assays in cell lysates and breast cancer cell lines ( Fig . 2 ) . These were the most potent compounds ( EC 50 < 15 µM ) representing the largest structural clusters . Immunoprecipitation was used to examine the ability of the compounds to interrupt the interaction between native and full - length Cdc42 and IQGAP1 proteins . Each compound was added to lysates from HEK293 cells at a final concentration of 50 µM and endogenous IQGAP1 was immunoprecipitated . DMSO alone was used as the negative control ( 100 % binding ) . Samples were analyzed by Western blotting and blots were probed for IQGAP1 and Cdc42 . The amount of endogenous Cdc42 that co - immunoprecipitated with IQGAP1 was quantified and normalized to the amount of IQGAP1 immunoprecipitated from the same sample . A representative blot with 12 of the 44 evaluated compounds is shown in Fig . 3a . No Cdc42 co - precipitated with rabbit IgG , documenting the specificity of the immunoprecipitation . The compounds were tested in at least three independent experiments and the most promising compounds were re - tested at different concentrations ( 0 . 2 , 0 . 6 , 1 , 5 , 16 or 50 µM ) . Four of the 44 compounds , namely NCGC00131308 , NCGC00098561 , MLS000332963 and NCGC00138812 , reduced the binding substantially ( Table 1 ) . NCGC00131308 and NCGC00138812 significantly reduced the interaction between endogenous IQGAP1 and Cdc42 by a mean of 60 % and 47 % , respectively ( Fig . 3b ) . In addition , the selected 44 compounds were assessed for their effects on cell viability . Analysis was per - formed in both MCF7 breast carcinoma cells with stable knockdown of IQGAP1 by siRNA ( termed MCF7 - siIQ8 ) and control MCF7 cells ( see Methods for details ) , to decipher whether the cytotoxicity could be caused by the disruption of the target protein – protein - interaction .

The selected compounds ( 50uM ) or DMSO ( vehicle ) were added to equal aliquots of protein lysates and endogenous IQGAP1 was immunoprecipitated with polyclonal anti - IQGAP1 antibodies . Anti - rabbit IgG was used as the negative control ( last lane ) . Immune complexes were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane . Western blots were probed with anti - IQGAP1 and anti - Cdc42 antibodies . 1 % of the protein lysates was loaded directly onto the gel ( Input ) . The data are representative of at least three independent experiments . Vertical lines indicate where irrelevant lanes were removed from the blots and added sections from a separate blot . Full - length blots are presented in Supplementary Fig . 5 .

MLS000332963 showed a moderate cytotoxicity ( EC50 = 19 . 95 µM , efficacy of 47 % ) in control MCF7 cells only ( Fig . 4b ) . The remaining two compounds did not show any noticeable effect on cell viability . We selected compounds NCGC00131308 , NCGC00138812 and MLS000332963 for additional cell - based experiments due to their activities in the primary , counter - screening and orthogonal assays ( Fig . 4b – d , Table 1 ) . Interestingly , while all three compounds were inactive in the His - GST counter - screen , NCGC00131308 and NCGC00138812 were active in the double - tagged Cdc42 counter - screen with EC 50 values of 4 . 47 and 6 . 31 µM , respectively . Although NCGC00098561 showed good activity in disrupting IQGAP1 and Cdc42 interaction in the biochemical HTRF assay ( validation assay : EC 50 = 7 . 94 µM , efficacy 84 % ) and was not active in either of the counter - screens ( Fig . 4a ) , it was removed from further cell - based experiments because of its cytotoxicity . Effects of the lead molecules on cell proliferation and migration . Because the interaction between IQGAP1 and Cdc42 enhances cell proliferation and migration , we examined if small molecules NCGC00131308 , NCGC00138812 and MLS000332963 can modulate these functions in breast cancer cells . MCF7 and MDA - MB - 231 cell growth was monitored in the presence of the compounds for 72 h using the IncuCyte live - cell analy - sis system . DMSO treated cells were used as the control . All three compounds had a dose - dependent inhibitory effect on proliferation of MCF7 and MDA - MB - 231 cells ( Fig . 5a , b ) . MLS000332963 exhibited the highest potency among the tested compounds with EC 50 values of 6 . 54 μM and 3 . 01 µM in MCF7 and MDA - MB - 231 cells , respectively . The scratch wound assay was used to assess the effect of the compounds on cell migration of MDA - MB - 231 cells . These cells were chosen for this assay because their migratory abilities are better than MCF7 cells . The cells were treated with NCGC00131308 , NCGC00138812 and MLS000332963 molecules at different concentrations or with DMSO as control , and the migration of the cells was kinetically monitored for 72 h . All three compounds inhibited the cell mobility in a dose - dependent manner ( Fig . 5c , Supplementary Fig . S2 online ) . The EC 50 of MLS000332963 was 2 . 7 μM with maximum efficiency of 39 % . NCGC00138812 was less active and had an EC 50 of 12 . 9 µM and maximum efficiency of 20 % . NCGC00131308 Table 1 .

Microscale thermophoresis assay . As mentioned above , the compounds NCGC00131308 and NCGC00138812 showed high activity in the HTRF counter - screen with the His and GST double - tagged Cdc42 , but not in the counter - screen with His - tagged GST ( Fig . 4c , d ) . These observations prompted us to investigate whether these compounds bind to Cdc42 rather than to IQGAP1 using the microscale thermophoresis assay . Additionally , we tested the compounds MLS000332963 and NCGC00098561 , which were inactive in both coun - ter - screens ( Fig . 4a , b ) . Cdc42 exhibited negative thermophoresis in a dose - dependent manner in the presence of NCGC00131308 and NCGC00138812 ( Fig . 6 ) . The dissociation constants ( K d ) for NCGC00131308 and NCGC00138812 were 28 . 12 µM ± 3 . 32 and 96 . 17 µM ± 14 . 41 , respectively . In contrast , the small molecules MLS000332963 and NCGC00098561 did not affect the thermophoretic motion of Cdc42 ( Fig . 6 ) , suggesting that these compounds do not interact with Cdc42 . Effects of the lead molecules on Cdc42 activation and filopodum formation . Based on the microscale thermophoresis assays , we selected compounds NCGC00131308 and NCGC00138812 for fur - ther cell - based studies . First , we evaluated the impact of the two compounds on the amount of active Cdc42 . Serum starved MDA - MB - 231 cells were incubated with DMSO ( control ) , 50 μM NCGC00131308 or 50 μM NCGC00138812 . After 2 h , cells were incubated with or without 100 ng / mL epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) for 10 min . The amounts of active Cdc42 in the cells were quantified using a GST - WASP - GBD pulldown assay . The WASP - GBD binds only GTP - bound ( active ) Cdc42 ; Therefore , the amount of bound Cdc42 indicates the amount of active Cdc42 19 . EGF significantly increases the amount of active Cdc42 in MDA - MB - 231 cells incubated with DMSO ( Fig . 6b , c ) . No Cdc42 bound to GST alone , documenting specificity ( Fig . 6b ) . NCGC00131308 abrogated the increase in GTP - Cdc42 induced by EGF ( Fig . 6b , d ) . By contrast , NCGC00138812 did not appreciably reduce activation of Cdc42 by EGF ( Fig . 6b , d ) . Changes in the levels of active Cdc42 directly impact actin cytoskeletal dynamics and the formation of filopodia 15 , 16 , which play an important role in adhesion and responses to external stimuli 17 . Therefore , we ana - lyzed the effects of compound NCGC00131308 on the characteristics of filopodia in MDA - MB - 231 cells . To visualize filopodia , we stained cells with phalloidin . The length , area , shape ( eccentricity ) and number of filo - podia were quantified with FiloQuant FIJI ( Fig . 6e , f ) . NCGC00131308 significantly decreased the length , area and the number of filopodia per cell ( Fig . 6f ) , all of which directly results from defective actin polymerization at the site of filopodia formation 20 . In addition , NCGC00131308 altered the shape of the filopodia , inducing NCGC00131308 - 7 - 6 - 5 - 4 - 100 - 75 - 50 - 25 0 Log [ compound ] , M A c t i v i t y , % primary HTRF validation His - GST His - Cdc42 - GST toxicity in control MCF7 toxicity in IQGAP1 - KD MCF7 MLS000332963 NCGC00098561 a - 7 - 6 - 5 - 4 - 100 - 75 - 50 - 25 0 Log [ compound ] , M A c t i v i t y , % primary HTRF validation His - GST His - Cdc42 - GST toxicity in MCF7 control toxicity in IQGAP1 - KD MCF7 NCGC00138812 - 7 - 6 - 5 - 4 - 100 - 75 - 50 - 25 0 Log [ compound ] , M A c t i v i t y , % d c b - 7 - 6 - 5 - 4 - 100 - 75 - 50 - 25 0 Log [ compound ] , M A c t i v i t y , % Figure 4 .

Overall , our data reveal that compound NCGC00131308 reduces the amount of active Cdc42 induced by EGF in MDA - MB - 231 cells , thereby reducing filopodia formation induced by EGF , a phenotype that affects migration of cancer cells 21 . Predicted binding model . To explore the binding interactions of NCGC00131308 and NCGC00138812 with Cdc42 , we performed docking studies of these two molecules at the Cdc42 - IQGAP1 binding interface and generated a possible binding model . Structural analysis of the PPI interface revealed a hydrophobic bind - ing pocket adjacent to the GTP binding site of Cdc42 , which is well - formed with potential for small molecule binding to disrupt the Cdc42 - IQGAP1 interaction ( Supplementary Fig . S4 online ) . The small molecules were therefore docked to the Cdc42 protein binding interface and the top - ranked docking poses were analyzed . The results showed that both inhibitors bind preferably to this pocket in a similar binding mode . As shown in the 2D diagram of inhibitor binding interaction analysis ( Fig . 7 ) , NCGC00131308 and NCGC00138812 fit in the pocket by forming extensive hydrophobic and aromatic interactions with surrounding residues A13 , V85 , S88 , K96 , and W97 . A hydrogen bonding interaction was formed with residue E62 and the piperazine ring of F2 , while a hydrogen bonding interaction was formed between residue D11 and the pyrimidine ring of H3 . In comparison , compounds MLS000332963 and NCGC00098561 , did not make such key interactions in the pocket . These results may explain the MST assay results and provide structural insight as to how the small molecules are able to disrupt the interaction between Cdc42 and IQGAP1 . Discussion Interactions between proteins are central to both intracellular signaling and inter - cellular communications and regulate numerous fundamental biological processes . A single interface of a protein frequently interacts with several other proteins to mediate a wide array of interactions and associations in protein complexes 22 . The intricate protein – protein interactions are tightly regulated to drive specific signaling outcomes for the cells . In some pathological conditions , undesirable protein – protein interactions may occur , which may be important in the disease pathophysiology 23 , 24 . Small molecule inhibitors can effectively interrupt specific protein – protein interactions and can be used as therapeutic strategies 25 . Cdc42 modulates numerous crucial physiological processes , such as cell cycle progression , cell migration , mitotic spindle orientation and establishment of polarity 26 – 28 . Additionally , Cdc42 is an important regulator of cytoskeletal dynamics during pathological conditions , such as invasion and metastasis of several types of cancer - 8 - 6 - 4 0 20 40 60 80 100 MCF7 Log [ compound ] , M C on f l u e n cy , % NCGC00131308 NCGC00138812 MLS000332963 - 9 - 8 - 7 - 6 - 5 - 4 0 20 40 60 80 100 MDA - MB - 231 Log [ compound ] , M C on f l u e n cy , % NCGC00131308 NCGC00138812 MLS000332963 0 20 40 60 80 0 25 50 75 100 Time , h R e l a t i ve w ound d e n s i t y , % 0 . 5 % DMSO 50 µM NCGC00131308 50 µM NCGC00138812 50 µM MLS000332963 - 6 - 5 - 4 0 25 50 75 100 Log [ compound ] , M R e l a t i ve w ound d e n s i t y , % NCGC00131308 NCGC00138812 MLS000332963 a b c d Figure 5 .

Increased expression of Cdc42 correlates posi - tively with cancer progression and poor clinical outcome in lung adenocarcinoma 32 , colorectal cancer 33 , breast carcinoma 34 and melanoma 35 , which makes Cdc42 an appealing target for cancer therapy . Cdc42 functions are modulated by direct interactions with several effector and signaling proteins 36 . Therefore , efforts have been made to find small molecule inhibitors that can specifically disrupt the interactions of Cdc42 with selected signaling molecules to suppress selected cellular functions , such as motility and invasion 37 . IQGAP1 , a widely studied Cdc42 binding partner ( for review , see Ref 4 ) , stabilizes Cdc42 in the active form 13 . Because overexpression of both IQGAP1 and Cdc42 is linked to carcinogenesis , small molecule inhibitors that efficiently disrupt the interaction between Cdc42 and IQGAP1 have potential for treating neoplastic progres - sion and metastasis . HTRF assays have been successfully used to screen and identify small molecules , which disrupt protein complexes and alter cell behavior 27 . This approach has been implemented to find new medications to prevent cancer cell invasion and metastasis 28 . Here we describe a novel high throughput HTRF assay to identify selective cell - active small molecule inhibitors that disrupt the interactions between Cdc42 and IQGAP1 . We measured the molecular interactions between His - Cdc42 and GST - IQGAP1 using a pair of commercially available , fluorescent - tagged antibodies specific for His or GST . We thoroughly optimized the concentrations of recombinant proteins and antibodies , as well as binding buffer components , to obtain a high signal - to - background ratio ( 7 . 1 - fold ) and Z’ - factor of 0 . 87 , which render this assay suitable for HTS . Eliminating false positive hits is a major challenge in HTRF assays 38 . To address this problem , we employed two different counter - screens . In the first , we directly linked the hexa - histidine and GST tags to each other .

After 2 h , 100 ng / mL EGF ( + ) or vehicle ( - ) was added for 10 min . After cell lysis , equal amounts of protein lysate were incubated with GST ( control ) or GST - WASP - GBD ( WASP ) for 2 h .

In both approaches , the fluorescent antibodies against the His and GST tags constantly stay in close proximity ; only tag and / or antibody binders should show activity and would be considered as false positives . We screened small molecule libraries of approximately 78 , 500 compounds and detected 198 compounds that significantly inhibited the interaction of Cdc42 with IQGAP1 . These 198 compounds were tested in both counter - screens . The 44 most potent compounds ( EC 50 < 15 µM ) from different chemotypes of structural clus - ters , which were inactive in the His - GST counter - screen , were selected for immunoprecipitation and cytotoxic - ity assays . Based on these assays , we selected four lead compounds , namely NCGC00131308 , MLS000332963 , NCGC00098561 and NCGC00138812 , for further analysis . Importantly , all four compounds consistently impaired the interaction of Cdc42 with IQGAP1 in cell lysates . From a medicinal chemistry perspective , these molecules have a reasonable structure for further struc - ture – activity relationship and optimization studies . Especially appealing are the tetrahydropyrido pyrimidi - namine NCGC00131308 and the pyrazolo pyrimidine NCGC00138812 compounds , which have desirable physicochemical characteristics , such as reasonable molecular weight , cLogP and tPSA , no chemically liable functionalities and an adequate number of hydrogen donors and acceptors . NCGC00098561 , which showed good inhibitory activity in the biochemical HTRF and immunoprecipitation assays , had a high cytotoxicity . This cytotoxicity is probably independent of the targeted IQGAP1 - Cdc42 interaction as the compound had very similar potency and efficacy in both control and IQGAP1 - knockout MCF7 cells . Therefore , the compound was not tested further in our cell - based assays . Figure 7 .

Therefore , we evaluated the effect of NCGC00131308 , MLS000332963 , and NCGC00138812 compounds on the proliferation of MCF7 and MDA - MB - 231 human breast carcinoma cells as well as on migration of MDA - MB - 231 cells . All three compounds effectively inhibited cell growth and migration , suggesting that they modulate cellular processes by interfering with IQGAP1 - Cdc42 interactions . Interestingly , NCGC00131308 , MLS000332963 and NCGC00138812 behaved similarly in all assays , except the counter - screen with the dual - tagged Cdc42 . NCGC00131308 and NCGC00138812 inhibited the HTRF signal in a dose - dependent manner , while MLS000332963 was inactive . We hypothesized that NCGC00131308 and NCGC00138812 might bind to Cdc42 and disrupt the homodimerization of Cdc42 induced by the dimeriza - tion of GST 40 . The second counter - screen with His - tagged GST indicates that none of the selected compounds interacts with antibodies to hexa - histidine , GST and / or HTRF because they were inactive in this assay . Also , we used the same concentrations of His - GST and His - Cdc42 - GST ( 100 nM ) in both counter - screens , so , if existent , the monomer – dimer equilibrium in both assays is comparable . Analysis by microscale thermophoresis revealed that compounds NCGC00131308 and NCGC00138812 interact directly with Cdc42 . By contrast , MLS000332963 and NCGC00098561 do not bind . NCGC00131308 prevented the increase in active Cdc42 induced by EGF in breast carcinoma cells . Active Cdc42 drives the forma - tion of straight and stable filopodia , which confer adequate force to push the membrane edge during directional migration 41 . To ascertain whether the inhibitors impair Cdc42 - dependent cellular effects , we analyzed filopodia formation by confocal microscopy . Consistent with the results of active Cdc42 assays , NCGC00131308 signifi - cantly decreased the length and number of filopodia generated by EGF . Moreover , NCGC00131308 causes bent filopodia with less eccentricity , which indicates reduced filopodia stiffness and likely contributes to decreased directional cell migration in our wound assay . To gain additional insight into how the four lead compounds suppress the interaction between Cdc42 and IQGAP1 , we performed computational modeling of the Cdc42 interface interacting with these compounds . Docking analysis provided plausible models of compounds NCGC00131308 and NCGC00138812 binding to the hydrophobic pocket adjacent to the GTP binding site of Cdc42 at the IQGAP1 interface , which could dis - rupt the Cdc42 - IQGAP1 interaction . Computational modeling showed that compounds MLS000332963 and NCGC00098561 do not fit well in the hydrophobic pocket , consistent with our experimental observations by thermophoresis . Accumulating evidence suggest that small GTPases , such as Rab and Ras , dimerize to function as signal - ing units with the capacity to activate cellular cascades , including the mitogen - activated protein kinase and PI3K / Akt pathways 42 , 43 . Understanding the biology of small GTPase dimerization has profound implications for pharmacological targeting of signaling pathways in cancer . We previously solved the crystal structure of Cdc42 bound to the GRD of IQGAP2 , which revealed that four molecules of Cdc42 bind two IQGAP2 molecules 12 . Importantly , two Cdc42 molecules form a dimer in the complex 12 . Elucidating the mechanism of action of the four compounds that we identified requires additional investigation . However , it is tempting to speculate that the small molecule inhibitors interfere with dimerization of Cdc42 molecules at the IQGAP1 binding interface 44 . The interaction of IQGAP1 with Cdc42 regulates the invasion of Salmonella typhimurium 45 and other bacteria 46 into host cells . IQGAP1 also participates in the pathogenesis of viral infections 47 . Thus , small mol - ecule inhibitors of the Cdc42 / IQGAP1 interaction could potentially be used against invading microorganisms . In conclusion , we developed a novel HTRF - based strategy and identified four small molecule inhibitors that disrupt the interaction of Cdc42 with IQGAP1 . The approach we developed could also be used to identify inhibi - tors that interfere with the association of Cdc42 with other binding partners to develop new therapies against neoplastic transformation and other pathological conditions , such as microbial infections .

IRDye® - 800CW and - 680RD ( Life Technologies TM , USA ) were used as secondary antibodies for Western blotting at 1 : 10 , 000 dilutions . Constructs and recombinant proteins . The generation of both the C - terminal half of IQGAP1 ( com - prising amino acids 864 – 1657 ) containing a GST - tag 48 and His - Cdc42 - Q61L 44 have been described previously . The His - Cdc42 - Q61L construct was generated from pGEX - Cdc42 - Q61L ( residues 1 – 184 of Cdc42 ; generously donated by Darerca Owen , University of Cambridge , Cambridge , UK ) by excising the plasmid and inserting it into pRSET . To make dual - tagged GST - Cdc42 - Q61L - His , a pGEX4T - His vector was generated . For this purpose , the phosphorylated oligo pair with nine His tags were annealed and inserted into pGEX4T at XmaI and XhoI sites ( 5 ′ - CCG GGC TGG AAG TTC TGT TCC AGG GGC CCC ATC ATC ATC ATC ATC ATC ATC ATC ATCAT - 3 ′ ; 5 ′ - TCG AGA TGA TGA TGA TGA TGA TGA TGA TGA TGA TGG GGC CCC TGG AAC AGA ACT TCCAG - 3 ′ ) . To make pGEX4T - Cdc42 - Q61L - His , Cdc42 - Q61L was synthesized by PCR using pGEX2T - Cdc42 - Q61L as template with the forward primer 5 - CGG GAT CCC AGA CAA TTA AGT GTG TTG TTG TGGG - 3 ′ ; and reverse primer 5’ - CCG GAA TTC TTA GAA TAT ACA GCA CTTCC - 3’ . Synthesized Cdc42 was cut with BamH I and EcoR I and inserted into pGEX4T - His at BamH I and EcoR I sites . DNA sequencing confirmed the sequences of all constructs . GST - IQGAP1 - C and GST - Cdc42 - Q61L - His were expressed in Escherichia coli BL - 21 and isolated using glutathione - Sepharose chromatography , essentially as previously described 48 . His - Cdc42 - Q61L was expressed in E . coli and purified by nickel - immobilized metal affinity chromatography as previously described 44 . 11 Vol . : ( 0123456789 ) Scientific Reports | ( 2022 ) 12 : 17372 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41598 - 022 - 21342 - w www . nature . com / scientificreports / Primary HTRF Assay for High Throughput Screening ( HTS ) . Recombinant His - Cdc42 - Q61L , GST - IQGAP1 - C in combination with acceptor XL665 conjugated anti - His antibody ( Anti - His - XL665 ) and donor Eu - cryptate conjugated anti - GST antibody ( anti - GST - cryptate ) were used for the HTRF assay to perform a high throughput screening of compound libraries in 1536 - well white solid bottom medium - binding plates ( Greiner Bio - One ) . For the assay , His - Cdc42 - Q61L and GST - IQGAP1 - C proteins were diluted and pre - mixed in the binding buffer ( 50 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl and 0 . 01 % Triton - X100 ) to final assay concentrations of 50 nM His - Cdc42 - Q61L and 1 . 5 nM GST - IQGAP1 - C . As control , 1 . 5 nM GST - IQGAP1 - C in the absence of His - Cdc42 - Q61L was used to gauge the maximal potential inhibition ( IC 100 ) . Anti - His - XL665 and anti - GST - cryptate anti - bodies were prepared as threefold concentrated working mixture in binding buffer just prior to dispensing , with final assay concentrations of 5 ng / μL and 0 . 7 ng / µL , respectively . Pre - mixed proteins ( 4 µL / well ) were dispensed to assay plates with a BioRAPTR FRD™ dispenser . The compounds , dissolved in DMSO , were pin - transferred to the wells ( 23 nL / well ) with a Kalypsus pintool instrument ( Wako Automation ) , followed by addition of 2 µL / well pre - mixed antibodies . The plates were incubated for 3 h at ambient temperature . Then , 1 μL / well of 2 . 8 M potas - sium fluoride was dispensed to prevent possible quenching , i . e . , to stabilize the signal . The signal was detected immediately with an Envision plate reader ( Perkin Elmer ) using the HTRF settings ( excitation at 340 nm , dual emission at 665 nm and 620 nm ) . DMSO alone was used as the vehicle control ( IC 0 ) . The data were calculated as the ratio 665 / 620 × 10 4 to normalize for any effects in the donor channel . The assay protocol is outlined in Supplementary Table S1 online . A 1536 - well plate with the established assay conditions and chosen controls of DMSO as IC 0 and 1 . 5 nM IQGAP1 protein as IC 100 was used to establish the signal - to - background ( S / B ) ratio and Z’ factor characteristics of the assay . Then , the Library of Pharmacologically Active compounds ( LOPAC ®1280 , Sigma Aldrich ) collection was screened in dose response for the purpose of establishing the robustness of the assay in a screening format and in the presence of the compounds . Compounds titrated 1 : 5 at seven concentrations in an interpolation man - ner were tested . The final concentrations of the compounds in the assay ranged from 38 µM to 3 . 6 nM . Following assay validation , the primary high - throughput screening HTS was performed with multiple NCATS in - house screening collections , at four final concentrations ( 38 µM to 105 nM ) . Inhibitors of the IQGAP1 / Cdc42 HTRF binding assay from the primary HTS were selected using compound dose response curve algorithms developed at NCATS , which assigns a curve response classification ( CRC ) number to each tested compound 18 . This method classifies primary hits into different categories according to their potency ( IC 50 ) , magnitude of response ( efficacy ) , quality of curve fitting ( r2 ) , and number of asymptotes . Selected compounds were re - tested using the HTRF assay to confirm initial activity , following the same format described above in a dose - dependent manner at seven concentrations in 1 : 3 serial dilutions . HTRF counter‑screens . Two different HTRF counter - screens were used to identify false positive hits . The two interacting proteins GST - IQGAP1 - C and His - Cdc42 - Q61L were replaced with His - tagged GST or Cdc42 - Q61L containing GST at the N - terminus and His at the C - terminus ( GST - Cdc42 - Q61L - His ) . First , GST - Cdc42 - Q61L - His was titrated in parallel with the pre - mixed His - Cdc42 - Q61L and GST - IQGAP1 - C to comparatively match the signal level to the signal of the primary HTRF assay . We chose 100 nM GST - Cdc42 - Q61L - His protein as the final concentration for the counter - screen . The assay protocol is outlined in Supplemen - tary Table S2 online . Briefly , 4 μL / well of GST - Cdc42 - Q61L - GST diluted in binding buffer was dispensed to the plates , followed by pinning 23 nL / well of selected hit compounds from the primary screening and addition of 2 μL / well premixed HTRF antibodies . After 3 h , 1 μL / well of 2 . 8 M potassium fluoride was added to the assay and the fluorescence signal was read on the Envision instrument . For controls , we used pre - mixed proteins GST - IQGAP1 - C and His - Cdc42 - Q61L ( primary assay’s regular conditions ) as IC 100 , and His - Cdc42 - Q61L only at 1 . 5 nM final concentration as IC 0 . The second counter - screen was performed with 100 nM His - tagged GST following the protocol described above . Cell culture . Cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium ( DMEM , ATCC # 30 - 2002 ) sup - plemented with 10 % ( v / v ) fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) ( ATCC # 30 - 2020 ) . MCF7 cells with stable knockdown of IQGAP1 ( termed MCF - siIQ8 ) and control MCF7 cells stably expressing Renilla have been described previously 39 . Briefly , a stable IQGAP1 - deficient MCF7 cell line was generated by integrating a specific siRNA targeted against IQGAP1 into the genome of MCF7 malignant breast epithelial cells 39 . The protein expression of IQGAP1 in knockdown cells is 80 % lower than in parent MCF - 7 cells 39 . HEK293 , MCF7 and MDA - MB - 231 cells were purchased from ATCC . CellTiter‑Glo® luminescent cell viability assay . Selected hit compounds were tested in CellTiterGlo cell viability assays to determine their cytotoxic effect on IQGAP1 knockout and control MCF7 cells . Prior to the assay , we assessed cell proliferation to keep both cell lines at similar exponential growth rates within 80 h after plating . For this purpose , the cells were plated onto 384 - well clear bottom black plates ( Perkin Elmer , Ultra ) at various cell densities ( between 625 and 10 , 000 cells / 50µL / well ) , spun down for 15 s , and placed into Incucyte SX5 ( Essen BioScience ) for automated bright - field channel reading every 4 h . Based on the growth curve , the densities for the two cell lines that displayed comparable exponential growth within 75 h were selected and the seeding number adjusted to be suitable for the 1536 - well plate . For the cytotoxicity assays , cells were harvested with 0 . 05 % trypsin , spun down at 125x g for 5 min , re - suspended in fresh DMEM supplemented with 5 % ( v / v ) FBS , and seeded into 1536 - well white solid bottom tissue culture - treated plates ( Greiner One , # 789173 - F ) at 600 cells / 5µL / well for knockout cells and 300 cells / 5µL / well for control cells using a Multidrop Combi dispenser 12 Vol : .

One column on each plate was dispensed with growth medium only ( no cells ) to gauge the maximal potential cytotoxic effect ( IC 100 control ) . The plates were kept in a tissue culture incubator at 37 °C with 5 % CO 2 for ~ 20 h for attachment and recovery of the cells . The next day , selected compounds were pin - transferred into the wells in columns 5 – 48 , 23nL / well at 7 - point 1 : 3 serial dilution , in the range of 46 µM to 78 nM final assay concentration . DMSO was used as the vehicle control ( IC 0 ) . The plates were covered with stainless steel cell culture Kalypsys lids and incubated at 37 °C with 5 % CO 2 under 95 % humidity for 72 h . Plates and reagents were equilibrated to room temperature and then 5 µL / well of CellTiter Glo ( Promega , # G7570 ) reagent was dispensed with a Multidrop Combi dispenser to the assay plates . After incubation for 10 min at ambient temperature , the luminescence signal was read with a ViewLux instrument ( Perkin Elmer ) with one second exposure . Relative luminescent units ( RLU ) for each well were normalized to the median RLUs from DMSO control wells as 0 % and “no cells” control wells as 100 % viability . Proliferation assay . MDA - MB - 231 and MCF7 cells were grown to confluence , detached using trypsin – EDTA cell dissociation buffer ( Gibco 12604013 ) and counted . Cells were plated into 384 - well , clear - bottom , black , tissue culture treated plates ( Corning 3683 ) using an automatic dispenser ( Thermo Multidrop Combi SMART ) at densities of 2000 cells / 10 µL / well for MDA - MB - 231 cells and 4000 cells / 10 µL / well for MCF7 cells in DMEM supplemented with 5 % FBS . After 4 h incubation at 37 °C with 5 % CO 2 , the growth medium was replaced with 10 µL medium containing compounds at 16 - point 1 : 2 serial dilutions with the final highest con - centration of 50 µM for each compound . All samples containing compounds were plated in triplicate . Cells in the first column of the plate were treated with 0 . 5 % DMSO as control . The plates were placed into an Incucyte SX5 Live - cell imaging system ( Sartorius ) and phase images were taken at 6 - h intervals for 72 h with 10X objec - tive lens . The growth medium containing compounds or DMSO was replenished after 24 h . The images were analyzed , and the growth curves generated by the Incucyte software 2020A using the basic analyzer mode . Scratch wound migration assay . MDA - MB - 231 cells were grown to confluence and plated into a 96 - well clear plate ( Sartorius 4379 ) at 30 , 000 cells / 100 µL / well in DMEM supplemented with 5 % FBS . Cells were incu - bated at 37 °C with 5 % CO 2 overnight . Even wounds were created using a 96 - pin wound device ( Sartorius 4493 ) following the manufacturer’s protocol .

The images were analyzed , and the wound density curves generated by the Incucyte software 2020A using the scratch wound analysis option . Microscopy and image analysis . MDA - MB231 cells were cultured in 24 - well plates containing glass coverslips . When 60 % confluent , cells were serum starved for 16 h , preincubated with 50 μM compound NCGC00131308 for 2 h , then incubated with 100 ng / mL epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) or vehicle for 10 min . Cells were fixed with 4 % PFA and stained with Alexa Fluor 488 Phalloidin ( Invitrogen™ # A12379 ) and Hoechst 33342 ( BD Biosciences # 561908 ) to visualize F - actin and DNA , respectively . Coverslips were mounted with ProLong glass antifade mounting medium ( Invitrogen ) , then imaged with a Zeiss LSM880 confocal microscope using a 63× objective lens . Cells and filopodia were segmented using FIJI / ImageJ 49 . Individual filopodia were segmented using the FiloQuant FIJI plugin 50 . Cells were segmented by Voronoi tessellation using Hoechst 33342 stained nuclei as seed points . The segmented images were quantified using the scikit - image Python package 51 . The following geometric and spatial parameters of the filopodia were quantified : ( 1 ) the branch length of each filopodial segment , ( 2 ) cumulative area of each segment , ( 3 ) eccentricity , defined as the ratio of the minor axis length to the major axis length , and ( 4 ) the number of filopodial segments per unit exposed cell membrane . Further data handling and plotting were done using the tidyverse R package . At least 200 cells were analyzed for each condition . Immunoprecipitation and western blotting . HEK293 cells were plated in 10 - cm dishes to reach 80 % confluence . The following day , the cells were washed with ice - cold phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) and lysed with 500 µl of Buffer A ( 50 mM Tris – HCl , pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl , and 1 % Triton X - 100 ) supplemented with com - plete protease and phosphatase inhibitors ( Roche , Mannheim , Germany ) . Lysates were subjected to two rounds of sonication for 10 s each , and insoluble material was precipitated by centrifugation at 13 , 000 xg for 10 min at 4 °C . Supernatants were precleared with protein A - Sepharose beads for 1 h . DMSO ( vehicle ) or different concen - trations of the compounds ( 0 . 2 , 0 . 6 , 1 , 5 , 16 or 50 µM ) were added to equal amounts of protein lysates for 30 min . Protein A - Sepharose beads and anti - IQGAP1 polyclonal antibodies were then added for 2 h at 4 °C . Anti - rabbit IgG antibodies were used as the immunoprecipitation control . Samples were washed five times with Buffer A , resolved by SDS - PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride ( PVDF ) membranes ( Millipore Corp ) . Mem - branes were probed with anti - IQGAP1 and anti - Cdc42 antibodies . After secondary antibody detection , Western blots were imaged using a LI - COR Odyssey infrared imaging system ( LI - COR , USA ) . Western blot quantifica - tion and analysis was conducted using Image Studio™ Lite ( LI - COR Biosciences ) . Assay of active Cdc42 . The GST - WASP - GBD ( GTPase - binding - domain ) has been described previously 19 . Briefly , GST - WASP - GBD was generated by polymerase chain reaction , digested , and ligated into a pGEX - KG vector 52 . Following expression of the GST fusion protein in E . coli , purification was performed by glutathione - 13 Vol . : ( 0123456789 ) Scientific Reports | ( 2022 ) 12 : 17372 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41598 - 022 - 21342 - w www . nature . com / scientificreports / Sepharose affinity chromatography . MDA - MB - 231 cells were grown in DMEM with 10 % FBS to 60 % confluence . Cells were starved of serum for 16 h , then incubated with either DMSO ( vehicle ) or 50 μM of the compounds indicated in the figure legend . After 2 h , 100 ng / mL EGF or vehicle was added for 10 min . After washing with 1xPBS , cells were lysed in lysis buffer ( 20 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 % NP - 40 , 20 mM NaF , and 20uM GTP , containing halt protease & phosphatase inhibitor cocktail ( Thermo Scientific # 1 , 861 , 281 ) . Lysates were pre - cleared with glutathione - Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C and equal amounts of protein was incubated with either GST ( control ) or GST - WASP - GBD for 2 h at 4 °C . Complexes were collected with glutathione - Sepharose and washed 5× with lysis buffer . Bound proteins were resolved by SDS - PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane . The membrane was cut immediately below the 37 kDa molecular weight marker . The top portion of the membrane was discarded and the bottom portion was probed with anti - Cdc42 antibody ( BD Transduction Laboratories # 610929 ) . Aliquots of whole cell lysate were processed in parallel . The membrane was cut immedi - ately below the 37 kDa molecular weight marker . After transfer , the bottom portion of the membrane was dis - carded and the top portion was probed with anti - tubulin ( Sigma – Aldrich # T5201 ) antibody ( loading control ) . The intensities of the Cdc42 and tubulin bands were quantified using Image Studio ( LI - COR Biosciences ) . Microscale thermophoresis ( MST ) . The interactions between Cdc42 and selected compounds were evaluated by MST using His - Cdc42 fluorescently labeled with Monolith His - tag labeling RED - Tris - NTA 2nd Generation kit ( Nanotemper Technologies ) following the manufacturer’s protocol . Two - fold serial dilutions of compounds were first prepared in DMSO , then further diluted in PBS containing 0 . 05 % Tween - 20 . Compounds were incubated with an equal volume of 100 nM labeled Cdc42 for 5 min at room temperature . Samples were loaded into Monolith™ standard capillaries and measured using Monolith NT . 115 ( Nanotemper Technologies ) with 50 % excitation power and 50 % MST power , with laser on and off times of 30 s and 5 s , respectively . The K d values were calculated by evaluating the thermophoresis and T - Jump signals using MO . Affinity Analysis soft - ware ( Nanotemper Technologies ) . All experiments were conducted in three biological replicates . Molecule docking . The crystal structures of IQGAP1 in apo form ( PDB code 3FAY ) 53 and IQGAP2 bound to Cdc42 ( PDB code 5CJP ) 12 have been solved . Therefore , we generated the binding complex of IQGAP1 / Cdc42 by superimposing IQGAP1 to IQGAP2 in the crystal structural complex with Cdc42 . The binding model of IQGAP1 / Cdc42 was used to predict inhibitor binding interaction . Docking studies were performed using the MOE program 54 . The ligand induced fit protocol was used and the binding affinity was evaluated using the GBVI / WSA score . Statistical analyses . All data are representative of at least three independent experiments conducted with three technical replicates unless indicated otherwise in the figure legends . Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software ( version 8 . 0 ; San Diego , CA ) . Bars indicate mean ± standard errors .
