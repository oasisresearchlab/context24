All EGFR ligands are synthesized as type 1 transmembrane precursors that undergo extracellular domain cleavage to release soluble ligands , which then bind to and activate the EGFR . This cleavage event is usually mediated by members of the a disintegrin and metalloprotease ( ADAM ) family . Understanding how these ligands are trafficked within the cell and released at the cell surface has the potential to produce significant new insights in cell biology . For example , the role of a trafficking adaptor for the transforming growth factor - alpha ( TGFA ) precursor ( see ‘Transforming growth factor - alpha’ section ) and the role of exosomal ligands in mediating receptor activation ( see ‘Amphiregulin’ section ) have been identi - fied during these studies . Aspects of individual ligands In the following paragraphs , recent advances for each of the seven EGFR ligands are discussed . Although in this section we discuss the ligands individually , we point out that these ligands do not act in isolation but rather affect the behavior of each other to accomplish a diverse repertoire of biological responses through EGFR signal - ing . From a focused view in this section , the next section highlights the differences , similarities , and cross - talk among the ligands . Epidermal growth factor EGF is the prototypic and founding member of the EGFR ligand family , first identified from submaxillary gland extracts during nerve growth factor studies 9 . The EGF - EGFR ligand - receptor system has greatly enhanced our understanding of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling , as evidenced by more than 70 , 000 publications for EGF alone . A recent review has distilled our current understand - ing of EGF and its actions 3 . More recently , a study uncovered that EGF - induced EGFR signaling enhances production of intracellular reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) by dual oxidase 1 ( DUOX1 ) 10 . This nicely complements earlier studies in which ROS were shown to enhance EGFR signaling by modulating both positive and negative regulators of EGFR signaling ( ADAMs and protein tyrosine phosphatases ) 11 – 14 . In another recent study , urinary EGF has been shown to be an independent risk factor for progression of chronic kidney disease , substantiating earlier findings by Harris and colleagues 15 – 18 . Transforming growth factor - alpha A historical perspective of key advances for TGFA , including TGFA regulation at the level of expression , trafficking , and processing , has been provided in a recent review 7 . Studies with transmembrane TGFA precursor ( pro - TGFA ) uncovered a novel interaction with Naked2 ( NKD2 ) and showed that NKD2 acts as a cargo recogni - tion and targeting ( CaRT ) protein for pro - TGFA 19 , 20 . In polarized epithelial cells , NKD2 envelops pro - TGFA - containing exocytic vesicles and directs them to the basolateral surface where the vesi - cles dock and fuse in an NKD2 myristoylation - dependent manner 19 . In Madin - Darby canine kidney ( MDCK ) cells expressing myristoylation - deficient NKD2 ( glycine at the second position is replaced by an alanine , G2A - NKD2 ) , the vesicles accumu - late at the basolateral “corner” and pro - TGFA is trapped in the cytoplasm 20 . Basolateral delivery of pro - AREG and pro - EREG , unlike pro - TGFA , is unaffected in G2A - NKD2 - expressing MDCK cells , suggesting utilization of alternate trafficking machinery 21 , 22 . More recently , the Schekman lab has demonstrated that cornichon - 1 ( CNIH ) acts as a cargo receptor for pro - TGFA in the early secretory pathway 23 . These findings indicate that each ligand has distinct nuances as to its biosynthetic trafficking , cell surface delivery , and ectodomain cleavage . Upstream of regulation at the protein trafficking level , TGFA can be regulated at the level of transla - tion by microRNAs ( miRs ) directly or indirectly ( for example , by miR - 374a 24 and miR - 505 25 directly and by miR - 124 through Slug 26 , in addition to other miRs reported earlier 7 , 27 ) . miR - 203 has been noted to be a broad EGF family regulator that binds to 3 ′ untranslated regions of AREG , EREG , and TGFA mRNA and regulates their stability 28 . Amphiregulin A recent review has highlighted our current understanding of AREG 2 . During pro - AREG studies , a new mode of EGFR ligand signaling via exosomes was discovered 29 . pro - AREG is packaged into exosomes , and pro - AREG - containing exosomes increase the invasiveness of recipient breast cancer cells . Exosomal uptake is partially dependent on ligand - receptor interaction as treatment of recipient cells with EGFR blocking monoclonal antibody attenu - ated the uptake of pro - AREG - containing exosomes . We have termed this new mode of EGFR activation by exosomal ligands as ExTRAcrine ( exosomal targeted receptor activation ) signaling . As noted in Figure 1 , ExTRAcrine signaling has features of auto - crine , paracrine , and juxtacrine signaling . It is possibly involved in endocrine signaling as well , since EGFR and pro - AREG can be detected in human plasma exosomes 30 . There is accumulating evidence that AREG is produced in a number of cells other than epithelial cells and fibroblasts . Artis and col - leagues have identified roles for AREG in immune surveillance 31 . Damaged epithelial cells release interleukin - 33 ( IL - 33 ) , IL - 25 , and thymic stromal lymphopoietin ( TSLP ) , which can activate group 2 innate lymphoid cells to release AREG , as well as IL - 5 , IL - 9 , and IL - 13 . It is thought that AREG ameliorates injury by binding to epithelial EGFR and stimulating proliferation and repair . This does not exclude an effect of AREG on EGFR - expressing , non - epithelial cells , including fibroblasts , polymorphonuclear cells , and Fox3 + regulatory T cells ; the latter two have been reported to express EGFR by flow cytometry 31 , 32 . A difficulty in studying the actions of the ligands in the mouse is the lack of robust antibodies to examine mouse EGFR by immunofluorescence or immunohistochemistry , or both . A variety of stresses , such as inflammation ( with lipopolysaccha - rides ) , ischemia , and hypoxia , induce AREG and EREG expres - sion in the brain ( cortex , striatum , and hippocampus ) . Under these stresses , glial cells show upregulation of EREG and AREG , which , when released , may protect against neuronal cell death . In Neuro2a cells , administration of EREG or AREG inhibits tunicamycin - induced endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) stress and cell death 33 . Recent work by Elder’s group continues to implicate a role for the C - terminal domain of AREG in promoting keratinocyte proliferation 34 . In addition , Yarden’s group has shown preclinical efficacy for an AREG neutralizing antibody in ovarian cancer 35 . Page 3 of 11 F1000Research 2016 , 5 ( F1000 Faculty Rev ) : 2270 Last updated : 29 OCT 2018 Epiregulin EREG binds to and activates EGFR and ERBB4 . EREG is weakly expressed in normal adult tissues but is overexpressed in diseases like cancer . Multiple roles for EREG in normal physiology and disease states have been reviewed recently 4 . However , the basic biological processes , such as the polarized distribution of pro - EREG within cells and the subsequent spatial control of EGFR activity , have been understudied . We have identified a new mode of epithelial transformation by apical mistrafficking of pro - EREG 22 . In polarized MDCK cells , pro - EREG is delivered to the basolateral membrane and its delivery is dependent on a tyrosine - based ( YXX Φ ) sorting motif . Disruption of this motif leads to complete apical delivery ; however , pro - EREG basolateral sorting is inde - pendent of the usual YXX Φ - recognizing clathrin adaptor , AP1B 22 . This apical rerouting of pro - EREG leads to activation of apical EGFR signaling , which has a different activation profile compared with basolateral EGFR signaling . MDCK cells expressing an apical mistrafficking mutant of EREG ( Y156A ) are more transforming than their wild - type , basolateral EREG - expressing counterparts when injected subcutaneously in nude mice . Additionally , there are mutations in human cancers that would disrupt the sorting motifs of the majority of EGFR ligands , including pro - EREG 36 . In a recent study with breast epithelial MCF10A cells , EREG expression was shown to contribute to tumor progression during early stages of cancer 37 . A comprehensive understanding of pathways that govern spatial compartmentalization of the EGFR ligands might reveal alternate approaches to treat cancer . Recently , additional functions of EREG have been uncovered . In circulating monocytes , EREG is upregulated acutely during short bursts of exercise and intermittent hypoxia in rat aortic smooth muscle cells . These facts may have implications for atherosclerosis 38 . Additionally , EREG is shown to assist in the proliferation , repair , or regeneration ( or a combination of these ) in liver , colon , and salivary gland acinar cells 39 – 42 . EREG also plays a role in odontogenesis by enhancing proliferation of dental apical papilla stem cells and inducing oral epithelial cell differentiation by dental papilla cells 43 . Wrana and colleagues have identified EGFR - dependent Yap sig - naling in the intestine which contributes to regeneration and tumorigenesis 44 . They reported that EREG , but not EGF or AREG , is able to maintain growth of organoids generated from Yap null mice ; however , it should be noted that the concentration of recom - binant mouse EREG given was very high and the source of the other ligands was unclear . Betacellulin Betacellulin ( BTC ) is a dual - specificity ligand that binds to and activates EGFR and ERBB4 . In a recent review , structural details and key functions of BTC gleaned from knockouts , transgenic ani - mals , patient samples , and in vitro studies have been reviewed 8 . Recently , it has also been shown that pro - BTC localizes to the basolateral membrane 45 . pro - BTC basolateral sorting is dependent on a cytoplasmic EEXXXL motif , and disruption of this motif , or introduction of a human cancer mutation ( E156K ) within this motif , leads to pro - BTC mistrafficking . An analogous EEXXXL motif is also responsible for basolateral sorting of pro - AREG 21 . This report also demonstrated that pro - BTC mistrafficking induces an EGFR - dependent hepatic polarity phenotype ( apical surfaces on the side , between two cells ) in otherwise columnarly polarized MDCK cells , a finding not observed with any of the other EGFR ligands . Recent publications have uncovered additional functions of BTC . BTC transgenic mice display high cortical bone mass 46 . Addition - ally , in bone metastases associated with castration - resistant pros - tate cancer , BTC is upregulated in osteoblasts and contributes to osteoblastic activity 47 . BTC transgenic mice also develop urothelial hyperplasia and show sex - dependent reduction in urinary protein Figure 1 . Modes of signaling via epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) ligands . Autocrine signaling occurs when a ligand is released from a cell and binds to EGFR on that same cell . Paracrine signaling refers to the released ligand acting on a nearby cell , usually a different cell type . Juxtacrine signaling occurs when a non - cleaved , transmembrane ligand binds to EGFR on an adjacent cell ; this is best documented for heparin - binding epidermal growth factor - like growth factor ( HBEGF ) . Amphiregulin ( AREG ) , transforming growth factor - alpha ( TGFA ) , and HBEGF , as well as EGFR , can be packaged into signaling competent exosomes . Uptake of exosomal AREG by recipient cells is , at least in part , dependent on EGFR , leading to the term exosomal targeted receptor activation ( ExTRAcrine ) . ExTRAcrine signaling has features of autocrine , paracrine , and juxtacrine signaling as well as possibly endocrine signaling since EGFR and AREG can be detected in human plasma exosomes 30 .

BTC has also been identified as a novel modulator of interferon ( IFN ) response and enhances the anti - viral action of IFN 49 . In a large cytokine and chemokine screen to modulate IFN responses , BTC was identified as one of the most potent modulators of the IFN response . Moreover , miR - 200 has been shown to control BTC ( and AREG ) translation 50 . Heparin - binding epidermal growth factor - like growth factor Roles for heparin - binding EGF - like growth factor ( HBEGF ) in multiple cellular processes in normal and disease states have been recently reviewed 5 . Among the EGFR ligands , pro - HBEGF has the longest residency time at the cell surface , perhaps explaining why pro - HBEGF functions as a receptor for the B fragment of Diph - theria toxin . Since the toxin binds only to human and monkey pro - HBEGF , mouse modelers have exploited this selective binding by introducing human pro - HBEGF into the ATG start site of mouse genes expressed in selected cell types , which can then be eliminated by administration of the toxin 38 , 39 . However , when repurposing pro - HBEGF in this way , possible “side effects” of human HBEGF ( that can bind to mouse EGFR and ERBB4 ) need to be considered 51 . Local administration of HBEGF helps mice recover from chronic suppurative otitis media , a chronic inflammation of the middle ear 52 . Delivery of EGF or FGF2 was not effective 53 . It is unclear whether auto - or cross - induction ( or both ) of other ligands play a role in this process 54 , 55 . HBEGF mRNA is also a target for miR - 132 , both of which play a major role in wound healing 56 . During the transi - tion from inflammation to proliferation in wound healing , miR - 132 expression was upregulated together with a concomitant decrease in HBEGF levels . Surprisingly , HBEGF downregulation coincided with the proliferative phase during wound healing and increased receptor activity . Other miRs ( for example , miR - 96 , miR - 212 , and miR1192 ) have also been shown to target HBEGF 57 – 59 . Epigen Epigen ( EPGN ) , the most recently discovered EGFR ligand , seems to be a low - affinity EGFR ligand . The localization of pro - EPGN in polarized epithelial cells is not known and its cytoplas - mic domain lacks any recognized basolateral sorting motifs 36 . Schneider and Yarden have recently reviewed EPGN structure and function 6 . EPGN knockout mice do not display an obvious phenotype 60 ; however , transgenic overexpression of EPGN during embryonic development induces sebaceous gland hyperplasia 61 . Interestingly , activation of the transcription factor Nrf2 , a master regulator of cellular anti - oxidant defense , causes sebaceous gland enlargement in an EPGN - dependent manner 62 . Pharmacologic acti - vation of Nrf2 has been employed as a cancer prevention strategy and this is due in part to its role in ROS detoxification 63 . However , Nrf2 activation - induced EPGN upregulation and subsequent EGFR activation might actually be pro - tumorigenic and act counter to its anti - cancer effects . EGFR signaling also regulates Nrf2 activity ; in cortical neurons , astragaloside IV ( extracted from Astragalus membranaceus ) induces HBEGF - dependent EGFR transactiva - tion that leads to Ser40 phosphorylation of Nrf2 and its nuclear translocation 64 . EPGN transgenic mice also show a peripheral demy - elinating neuropathy , leading to late - onset muscular dystrophy 65 . Different ligands , differing functions EGFR can be activated by seven related , but distinct , ligands . Multiple publications have noted the capacity of these different ligands to act in a “functionally selective” manner ( that is , to pro - duce quantitatively and , to a lesser extent , qualitatively distinct cel - lular responses 66 – 68 ) . It is important to note that EGFR is one of four members of a family of related receptors . The others are desig - nated as ERBB2 / HER2 , ERBB3 / HER3 , and ERBB4 / HER4 . Of the ligands that bind to the EGFR , three ( EREG , HBEGF , and BTC ) are known to bind to and activate ERBB4 . None of the EGFR ligands is known to interact with ERBB2 or ERBB3 . A family of EGF - related ligands , termed neuregulins , binds to ERBB3 and ERBB4 . There is no known ligand for ERBB2 . In some cases , the ligand functional selectivity could be due to the capacity of some of the ligands to activate ERBB4 ; however , dif - ferences also exist in cells that do not express detectable levels of ERBB4 . As noted above , four ligands ( EGF , TGFA , AREG , and EPGN ) interact solely through EGFR , yet they do not produce iden - tical biological responses . In particular , AREG is often regarded as a low - affinity ligand for the EGFR . Crystallographic studies have described high - resolution ligand : ectodomain structures for EGF : EGFR , TGFA : EGFR , and NRG - 1 β : ERBB4 69 . However , these stud - ies do not provide an explanation for downstream differences in biological activity . Recently , a comparative study 70 of EGF , TGFA , AREG , and BTC binding to the EGFR and subsequent dimer formation has made clear that EGF and TGFA have a distinct preference to pro - duce EGFR : ERBB2 heterodimers compared with EGFR : EGFR homodimers , but that BTC and AREG produced dimers of both types equally . In addition , AREG produced significantly ( 50 % ) fewer dimers of either type compared with the other ligands . These initial data point to dimerization - competent , conformation - based receptor differences provoked by different ligands as a potential basis for heterogeneity in signaling and biological outcomes . These data and the related issues of receptor methylation and receptor antagonists ( discussed below ) will need to be evaluated . Another fact , sometimes forgotten or ignored , is that EGFR ligands can auto - and cross - induce one another , adding a layer of com - plexity to studies of an individual ligand 54 , 55 . In addition , the often observed co - expression of EPGN , EREG , AREG , and BTC , which may be due to their chromosomal clustering on human 4q13 - 21 and 5E1 in the mouse , further complicates our understanding of the role of individual ligands in biological processes 55 . ExTRAcrine signal - ing and auto - and cross - induction of EGFR ligands are variables that merit consideration in systems biology approaches to the merg - ing fields of autocrine signaling and quorum sensing , as reviewed elsewhere 71 . Interestingly , exogenous administration of ligands has recently been used as a treatment strategy for certain disease conditions in mice . Table 1 lists distinct actions recently observed for individual EGFR ligands in vivo . Once again , this is a highly selective compilation and we apologize for any omissions . We have chosen to highlight studies that identify new functions of the individual ligands . Page 5 of 11 F1000Research 2016 , 5 ( F1000 Faculty Rev ) : 2270 Last updated : 29 OCT 2018 Ligand processing and delivery to the cell surface As noted above , all seven mammalian EGFR ligands are syn - thesized as a type 1 transmembrane precursor and are processed through biosynthetic compartments common to other secretory and cell surface proteins . We have mentioned earlier that mammalian ligands are usually cleaved by ADAMs . Owing to the focus on EGFR ligands in this review , we have not elaborated on ADAM activity in cleavage of EGFR itself . ADAM - mediated EGFR cleav - age acts as a negative feedback for EGFR signaling and acts in concert with the positive feedback through ligand shedding 72 . Drosophila genetics has identified the involvement of particular gene products ( Rhomboid , Star ) for intracellular trafficking of the fly EGFR ligands . Recent work in mammalian cells has found at least two novel roles for inactive rhomboids ( iRhoms ) in the processing of EGFR ligand precursors 73 . Rhomboid gene products are known to be seven membrane - spanning molecules , which function as intramembrane serine pro - teases that cleave various transmembrane molecules within the cell or at the cell surface 73 . The rhomboid family also includes catalytically inactive proteins termed iRhoms . Although rhomboid cleavage of the fly EGFR ligand precursor is required for process - ing to the cell surface , the presence of iRhoms in the biosynthetic pathway prevents this cleavage and leads to intracellular degrada - tion of EGFR ligand precursors 74 . iRhoms localize to the ER . In this way , iRhoms block the cell surface expression of multiple EGFR ligands , several of which are not substrates for the catalytic rhomboids . Hence , the iRhoms may not just compete with rhom - boids , but rather regulate EGFR ligand levels by an independent mechanism , suggesting that the iRhom gene may have evolved a distinct regulatory function . Consistent with this idea , during evolution the iRhoms have acquired large segments of sequence not shared with the catalytic rhomboids . In flies , the independent mechanism that regulates intracellular ligand levels is identified as the ER - associated protein degradation pathway that leads to proteo - somal degradation 73 . A second , less direct , mechanism by which iRhoms control the pro - duction of bioactive secreted EGFR ligands is through control of the ultimate step in processing : the metalloprotease - mediated , cell - surface cleavage of the ligand precursor . This step is executed by members of the ADAM protease family of which ADAM17 is prob - ably the most significant member for EGFR ligands . ADAMs are single - pass transmembrane proteins that are trafficked through the ER and Golgi before reaching the cell surface , where the ectodo - main proteolytically cleaves the ectodomain of substrates , such as EGFR ligand precursors . During intracellular trafficking , ADAMs are converted by furin - dependent proteolytic processing in the Golgi from an inactive form to a mature active species , and this requires iRhoms 75 – 78 . When mammalian iRhoms are deleted or knocked down , no mature cell surface ADAM17 molecules are produced and in turn ADAM17 substrates , such as EGFR ligand precursors are not cleaved . In mammals , there are two iRhoms ( RHBDF1 / iRhom1 and RHBDF2 / iRhom2 ) , which seem to have overlapping effects on ADAM17 maturation , depending on the cell type . iRhom effects , however , are selective toward ADAM17 . Since ADAM17 also cleaves the inflammatory tumor necrosis factor precursor , iRhoms may influence both cell proliferation and inflammatory pathways . Interestingly , dominant iRhom2 mutations have been detected in an inherited syndrome , tylosis ( thickening of the palms and soles ) , in patients with esophageal cancer 79 . The disorder appears to be due to mutations in the N - terminal cytosolic domain of iRhom2 that stabilize the protein . These mutations have been linked to increased release of AREG ( and HBEGF ) and increased EGFR activity . The impact of these mutations on ADAM17 activity is unsettled 79 – 81 . A spontaneous recessive mutation in this domain of iRhom2 has been Table 1 . In vivo administration of epidermal growth factor receptor ligands as treatment strategies .

Of interest , there is a suppressor of Cub , Mcub , in which there is a loss - of - function mutation in mouse AREG 82 . Ligand interactions with receptors Although the complexities presented by multiple ligands binding to multiple ErbB receptors are described above and in more detail elsewhere 68 , 70 , a few recent publications give additional param - eters to consider . First , an antagonist has now been described for the mammalian receptors 83 , which adds to the negative control of ligand receptor interaction described some time ago for the Drosophila EGFR system . In flies , the secreted molecule Argos is able to associate with fly EGF and prevent ligand bind - ing to the Drosophila EGF receptor ( DER ) 84 , 85 . Although an Argos equivalent has not been detected in mammals , Zheng and colleagues 83 report that migration inhibitory factor ( MIF ) , which is O - glycosylated and secreted , binds to EGFR and blocks EGF binding . This antagonist is , therefore , mechanistically distinct from Argos . The report does show that MIF blocks EGF binding to its receptor in cell culture , preventing activation of the recep - tor and downstream signaling pathways , and that recombinant MIF interacts with the recombinant EGFR ectodomain in a purified system , but there are a few missing pieces to this provocative and potentially significant report . Does MIF interact with the EGFR at biologically significant concentrations ? What is the receptor interaction site for MIF and does it overlap with the known ligand binding sites ? Is there specificity to the MIF interaction within the ERBB system or unrelated receptors ? Importantly , this study also shows that EGF activation of its receptor induces the secretion of a metalloprotease ( MMP 13 ) that degrades MIF and thus provides a feedback loop to this EGFR antagonist . The EGFR is subject to a variety of co - and post - translational modifications that have significant roles in the capacity of the receptor to transduce second messenger systems following ligand binding . Recently , the role of methylation in mediating high - affinity ligand binding has been described 86 . Methylation at R198 and R200 within the EGFR ectodomain is reported to mediate high - affinity EGF binding . When receptor methylation is pre - vented by mutagenesis of the two Arg residues or by knockdown of the relevant methyltransferase ( PRMT1 ) , dissociation constant ( Kd ) values are altered approximately threefold to reflect a loss of higher affinity binding compared with the wild - type receptor . Decreased ligand - dependent receptor dimerization , activation , and downstream signaling , including tumorigenesis , are observed in the absence of receptor methylation , compared with wild - type receptor . Similarly , exogenous expression of PRMT1 increased high - affinity ligand binding to the EGFR , as well as receptor - mediated down - stream signaling events . The study also provides evidence that a pool of PRMT1 is localized within the ER . The EGFR ectodomain is often subdivided into four regions ( D1 , D2 , D3 , and D4 ) with EGF binding requiring molecular contacts with D1 and D3 . In untreated cells , over 90 % of the receptor exists in an inactive or “tethered” state involving interaction of residues in D2 and D4 that sterically prevent ligand binding to the D1 and D3 regions . Methylation of R198 and R200 , located in D2 , is proposed on the basis of molecular modeling to destabilize the teth - ered conformation and thereby increase receptor in the extended conformation , which allows high - affinity binding to D1 and D3 . In the past , the basis of high - affinity binding has been attributed to receptor heterogeneity or negative cooperativity 87 . Recent studies that have supported these mechanisms may have to be adjusted to include receptor methylation status . The level of methylated recep - tor is estimated to be approximately 10 % of the EGFR population , which is about the same as the high - affinity binding receptor pool . Since methylation of the EGFR ectodomain is reported to occur within the lumen of the ER / Golgi during biosynthesis , the authors concluded that the level of PRMT1 activity in that compartment may determine the size of the high - affinity receptor pool . If the above studies are confirmed , methylation may also contribute to high - affinity binding . Analyses of colorectal tumor tissue showed an increased level of methylated EGFR compared with control tissue . Methylated recep - tor was correlated with a worse overall patient survival and higher recurrence rate . Cetuximab , an EGFR neutralizing monoclonal antibody , is used to treat certain cancers , particularly colon cancer . This antibody binds to the D3 region of the EGFR , thereby blocking ligand binding . Methylation not only increased high - affinity EGF binding but also decreased the capacity of cetuximab to interfere with ligand binding . In tissues of patients with cancer , the presence of methylated receptor was a predictor of poor patient response to this therapeutic agent . In summary , study of the EGFR and its ligands , since their discovery more than fifty years ago , continues to yield important insights into multiple biological processes . From oocyte maturation , blastocyst implantation , and embryonic development to organ development and maintenance and diseases like cancer , this line of investigation continues to be broadly relevant and clinically important .
