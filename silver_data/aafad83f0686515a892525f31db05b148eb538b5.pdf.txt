A new study now reveals that ADF / coﬁlin preferentially dismantles branched networks and provides new insights into the collaborative work of ADF / coﬁlin and Aip1 on ﬁlament disassembly at the molecular level . The highly dynamic and tightly regulated remodelling of the actin cytoskeleton is an essential requirement for many cellular processes , including endocytosis , cytokinesis and cell migration . These processes are accompanied by a constant turnover of actin structures to provide the cells with the required plasticity to quickly alter speciﬁc actin architectures in response to signalling cues and , additionally , to replenish the pool of assembly - competent , ATP - bound actin monomers to fuel new assembly reactions [ 1 ] . A paper in this issue of Current Biology now adds to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind actin - ﬁlament disassembly mediated by the combined action of the actin - binding proteins ADF / coﬁlin and Aip1 [ 2 ] . Key players known to accelerate ﬁlament disassembly are a family of small and ubiquitous proteins collectively called actin depolymerization factor ( ADF ) / coﬁlin [ 3 ] . Vertebrate cells express three different ADF / coﬁlins ( ADF , coﬁlin 1 and coﬁlin 2 ) , whereas yeast expresses a single ADF / coﬁlin isoform . ADF / coﬁlin binds in a cooperative manner preferentially to aged ADP – F - actin and mediates severing by altering the mechanical properties of the ﬁlament [ 4 , 5 ] . Structural and biochemical analyses revealed that coﬁlin binding changes the subunit tilt and increases the helical twist of the ﬁlament [ 4 ] , thereby weakening lateral contacts between actin monomers [ 6 ] and decreasing the persistence length of the ﬁlament [ 7 ] . Severing occurs preferentially at boundaries between bare and ADF / coﬁlin - decorated ﬁlament segments , thereby controlling the overall ﬁlament length , depending on ADF / coﬁlin - binding density [ 8 ] . ADF / coﬁlin remains bound to dissociated ADP – actin monomers and inhibits nucleotide exchange ( ATP for ADP ) on monomeric actin [ 9 ] . Thus , proﬁlin and other accessory proteins , such as Srv2 / cyclase - associated protein ( CAP ) , are required to efﬁciently recycle ADF / coﬁlin - bound ADP – actin monomers back into an assembly - competent , ATP - bound state [ 10 , 11 ] . R450 Current Biology 25 , R448 – R469 , June 1 , 2015 ª 2015 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved Current Biology Dispatches In vitro , severing of actin ﬁlaments is observed only at low ADF / coﬁlin : actin ratios [ 12 ] . Notably , the resulting fragments do not disassemble quickly into monomers , but remain rather stable . However , at high ADF / coﬁlin : actin ratios , ADF / coﬁlin instead fully decorates actin ﬁlaments and suppresses severing [ 12 ] . Intriguingly , the cellular concentrations of ADF / coﬁlin exceed micromolar values and are therefore formally more than sufﬁcient to stabilize instead of sever the ﬁlaments . Since the disassembly of F - actin mediated by ADF / coﬁlin alone simply is too inefﬁcient and undirected to explain the rapid turnover of actin networks in living cells [ 13 ] , additional actin - binding proteins , such as Aip1 , coronin or Srv2 / CAP , must synergize with ADF / coﬁlin to markedly accelerate actin disassembly [ 14 , 15 ] . Aip1 ( actin interacting protein 1 ) was identiﬁed in a two - hybrid screen for yeast actin - binding proteins [ 16 ] . This 65 kDa WD40 domain repeat protein consists of two seven - bladed b - propeller domains and contains binding sites for actin and coﬁlin . Aip1 has been shown to enhance ADF / coﬁlin - mediated actin - ﬁlament disassembly [ 17 ] , but was initially proposed to cap ﬁlament barbed ends and facilitate coﬁlin - mediated disassembly by preventing the reannealing of severed ﬁlaments , acting in a similar way to heterodimeric capping protein . Two recent studies from the Pollard and Brieher labs have assessed the interplay of Aip1 and ADF / coﬁlin in more detail and challenged this view [ 18 , 19 ] . They have provided conclusive evidence that Aip1 is an ADF / coﬁlin - dependent actin disassembly factor that can boost actin - ﬁlament disassembly by about one order of magnitude and have shown that Aip1 is not a barbed - end capping protein . Although both groups share the view that Aip1 overturns the rules of ADF / coﬁlin - mediated actin disassembly , such that increasing ADF / coﬁlin : actin ratios now result in ﬁlament destabilization through much faster severing , they diverge with respect to the issue of whether ADF / coﬁlin is displaced from the ﬁlaments by Aip1 or not . The new work from Gressin et al . [ 2 ] published in this issue builds upon these ﬁndings and ﬁrst shows that yeast ADF / coﬁlin preferentially disassembles branched networks rather than either parallel or antiparallel ﬁlament bundles . The authors employed an elegant micropatterning technique to induce the growth of ﬂuorescently labelled actin ﬁlaments with a deﬁned architecture developing from two adjacent small bars coated with an activator of the actin - nucleating Arp2 / 3 complex ( Figure 1 ) . Small holes in a PDMS layer placed above the bars allowed these authors to introduce additional proteins into the assay . Upon addition of yeast ADF / coﬁlin they observed weaker decoration of branched networks than bundles of parallel or mixed orientation . Consistently , branched actin networks generated by Arp2 / 3 complex on the surface of the bars disassembled more rapidly than the ﬁlament bundles growing away from the bars ( parallel orientation ) or those meeting the same type of ﬁlaments emerging from the adjacent bar ( mixed orientation ) . Interestingly , upon addition of ADF / coﬁlin and Aip1 all three types of actin structure disassembled rapidly , suggesting that ADF / coﬁlin dismantles different types of actin cytoskeleton in an architecture - dependent manner , while cooperation of ADF / coﬁlin with Aip1 is necessary to trigger the full disassembly of all actin - ﬁlament networks ( Figure 1 ) . To better understand the molecular details of ADF / coﬁlin - mediated actin - ﬁlament disassembly , Gressin et al . [ 2 ] then used multi - color total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy at a single ﬁlament / single - molecule level and reported several intriguing observations . Using ﬂuorescently labelled ADF / cofilin ADF / cofilin Aip1 Aip1 fast slow A B Current Biology slow Figure 1 . Disassembly of different actin structures by ADF / coﬁlin and Aip1 . A branched actin network was polymerized on bar - shaped structures ( light grey ) coated with an activator for the Arp2 / 3 complex ( dark blue ) . Filaments growing out of the coated region converged and formed loose bundles . ( A ) Added ADF / coﬁlin bound to aged ADP – actin ﬁlaments ( yellow ) with a higher occupancy on the bundles compared with branched networks . ADF / coﬁlin - decorated ( red ) branched actin networks were therefore partially dismantled and de - branched , whereas the ﬁlament bundles remained stable . After addition of Aip1 fast disassembly of all actin structures occurred . ( B ) The simultaneous addition of both factors , ADF / coﬁlin and Aip1 , also led to complete disassembly of all actin networks , albeit with much slower kinetics when compared with Aip1 addition to ADF / coﬁlin - saturated actin structures , illustrating that the binding of ADF / coﬁlin is the rate - limiting step in this process . Current Biology 25 , R448 – R469 , June 1 , 2015 ª 2015 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved R451 Current Biology Dispatches actin and ADF / coﬁlin , they saw cooperative binding of ADF / coﬁlin to actin ﬁlaments , and the results revealed that accumulation of a minimum cluster of 23 ADF / coﬁlin molecules on the ﬁlament is required for severing ( Figure 2 ) . Moreover , they made an exciting observation that these ADF / coﬁlin clusters remain associated at or near the pointed ends of severed ﬁlaments for extended periods of time . The effect of Aip1 on disassembly of single ﬁlaments was most effective when ADF / coﬁlin fully decorated actin ﬁlaments , which is again consistent with Gressin et al . ’s observation that parallel and mixed - orientation actin bundles are rapidly disassembled by ADF / coﬁlin in the presence of Aip1 but not by ADF / coﬁlin alone . Interestingly , they also found some evidence for displacement of ADF / coﬁlin upon addition of Aip1 , supporting the idea that Aip1 might promote severing by competing with ADF / coﬁlin to locally reduce the density of coﬁlin on the ﬁlaments and generate new boundaries between bare and ADF / coﬁlin - decorated ﬁlament segments [ 20 ] . This work provides substantial new insights into the biochemical reactions that regulate ADF / coﬁlin - mediated actin - ﬁlament disassembly . But , as is frequently the case , a number of important questions remain to be addressed . For instance : what are the kinetics of ADF / coﬁlin release from the ﬁlament after addition of Aip1 and is actin released only from one end of the depolymerizing ﬁlament or from both ends , as suggested by others [ 19 ] ? Probably the most important question for our future understanding of the mechanism is whether ADF / coﬁlin dissociates alone or in a complex with actin . On the one hand , it is possible that Aip1 unloads ADF / coﬁlin from the ﬁlaments to create more boundaries for better severing , but , on the other hand , it is also conceivable that Aip1 destabilizes the ﬁlament directly and releases ADF / coﬁlin – actin complexes for direct recycling . Thus , this work suggests an as yet unidentiﬁed function for ADF / coﬁlin , namely to serve as a marker that maintains actin ﬁlaments or networks in a pre - disassembly state , which in turn can be subsequently utilized by Aip1 for full disassembly .
