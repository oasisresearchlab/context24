Such filaments form the core of thin , tubular , membrane - bound cell surface protrusions known as filopodia , which are a major feature of mammalian cell morphology . Filopodia are dynamic structures that help cells sense environmental cues , and play a role in cell migration , axon guidance , angiogenesis and other processes . RhoGTPases bind to and control the activity of mDia proteins , and several other binding partners of the three mDia1 isoforms — mDia1 , mDia2 and mDia3 — have been documented . Two independent pathways controlling mammalian filopodium formation have emerged , with one driven by the RhoGTPase Cdc42 , and the other by Rif . While mDia2 has been the main formin implicated in forming filopodia , mDia1 has recently surfaced as the key formin utilized by both the Cdc42 and Rif pathways to drive filopodial protrusion . mDia Domain Organization and Interacting Proteins When cells migrate , they extend dynamic membrane - bound actin - rich tubular protrusions known as filopodia . 1 Formins are a family of large multi - domain proteins that nucleate and polymerize actin to form linear actin filaments like those found within filopodia . 2 In this review we will focus on the formins mDia1 – 3 and their role in filopodium formation . Formins function as dimers and nucleate actin by means of a formin homology 2 ( FH2 ) domain that binds globular actin monomers . Interaction of the adjacent formin homology 1 ( FH1 ) domain with profilin effectively recruits actin monomers to the formin dimer , facilitating the polymerization process . 3 A subset of formins , known as Diaphanous - related formins ( Drfs ) , bind to and are regulated by RhoGTPases . 3 Drfs are rendered inactive by interaction of a C - terminal Diaphanous autoregulatory domain ( DAD ) with an N - terminal Diaphanous inhibitory domain ( DID ) ( Fig . 1 ) . The binding of a RhoGTPase to the N - terminal GTPase binding domain ( GBD ) contributes to disruption of this autoinhibitory interaction , which results in the activation of the Drf . 2 In the case of the Drf FHOD1 , phosphorylation of C - terminal serine and threonine residues by ROCK also overcomes the autoinhibition . 4 Other domains found in Drfs include a a dimerization domain ( DD ) and a coiled coil ( CC ) region , and some groups believe that the DD and DID together constitute a loosely defined formin homology 3 ( FH3 ) domain . 3 An N - terminal phospholipid - binding basic domain ( BD ) has also been identified in the Drfs mDia1 and mDia2 . mDia1 has three stretches of basic amino acids in this domain , which allows it to localize to the plasma membrane , while mDia2 has two . 5 In contrast , the Drf DAAM1 has only one stretch of basic amino acids in its N - terminal , and the distribution of con - stitutively active DAAM1 is restricted to the cytoplasm . 6 This might explain why only mDia1 and mDia2 have been implicated in the formation of membrane - bound cell surface protrusions like filopodia and lamellipodia , 7 - 9 while mDia3 — lacking this BD — has only been reported to generate cytoplasmic actin structures . 10 Several RhoGTPases and other proteins have been reported to bind to mDia1 - 3 . These are summarized in Figure 1 . mDia Proteins in Actin - Based Cellular Structures mDia1 - 3 form several types of actin - based cellular structures . Within the cytoplasm , mDia1 gives rise to stress fibers , 11 , 12 and mDia2 drives the actin dynamics that power vesicle movement 13 and creates the actin scaffold for constriction of the contractile ring during cytokinesis . 14 At the plasma membrane , both mDia1 and mDia2 have been shown to form lamellipodia 8 , 15 and filopodia . 7 , 16 A role for formins in lamellipodial protrusion is not surprising — once thought to be structures comprised of dendritic networks of branched microfilaments , lamellipodia have recently been reported to contain linear actin filaments as well . 17 We have found mDia3 to be capable of inducing filopodia in N1E115 neuroblastoma cells , despite not being able to detect the presence of endogenous mDia3 protein in this particular cell line . 16 All three mDia isoforms have also been linked to invadopodia protrusion , 18 while mDia2 alone plays a role in forming the filopodial precursors of dendritic spines . 19 Actin dynamics leading to the formation of the phagocytic cup in macrophages are believed to involve mDia1 and mDia2 too . 20 * Correspondence to : Sohail Ahmed ; Email : sohail . ahmed @ imb . a - star . edu . sg Submitted : 03 / 28 / 12 ; Accepted : 03 / 29 / 12 http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 4161 / cib . 20214 Communicative & Integrative Biology 5 : 4 , 340 – 344 ; July / August 2012 ; G 2012 Landes Bioscience 340 Communicative & Integrative Biology Volume 5 Issue 4 © 2012 Lande s B i o sc i en c e . D o no t d i s t r i bu t e . mDia Proteins and Filopodium Formation in Mammalian Cells Previous studies have pointed to a role for mDia2 in mammalian filopodia . A decrease in filopodial protrusion was seen in mouse fibroblasts overexpressing constitutively active Cdc42 and microinjected with anti - mDia2 antibodies , as well as cells cotransfected with activated Cdc42 and a non - functional mDia2 mutant . 21 In NIH3T3 fibroblasts , mDia2 localized to the tips of filopodia in cells over - expressing constitutively active Rif . 9 Constitu - tively active mDia2 , when overexpressed alone in B16F1 melanoma cells , also accumulated at filopodial tips . 22 Furthermore , knockdown of mDia2 protein in mouse hippocampal neurons reduced the formation of the filopodial pre - cursors of dendritic spines . 19 In more recent work , mDia1 - 3 have been shown to induce filopodia in neuronal cells when overexpressed on their own . 7 , 16 However , only mDia1 was seen within filopodia , as observed by time lapse imaging of live cells . 7 , 16 The lack of mDia2 and mDia3 in neuronal filopodia implies that these Drfs might be involved in the initiation of filopodium formation but not the elongation of the structures . One possibility is that mDia2 and mDia3 generate short microfilaments that are subsequently elongated by mDia1 to form mature filopodia . This would tie in with the suggestion that mDia2 is a relatively strong nucleator but poor elongator of microfila - ments , 23 based on observations that it elongates microfilaments at a slower rate than mDia1 . 24 The filopodia induced by full - length wild - type mDia2 appeared cylindrical and of even thickness along their length , 7 , 16 and so did the filopodia formed by FH1FH2 - mDia2 , a fragment of mDia2 that consists of only the FH1 and FH2 domains . 8 This is unlike the club - shaped filopodia obtained by transfecting Figure1 . Domain organization and interacting partners of mDia1 - 3 . The shortest fragment ( s ) known to bind the respective mDia isoforms is shown for each interacting protein . Excluded from this diagram are YWK - II , which binds a 223 aa fragment of hDia1 that shares 96 % aa sequence identity with mDia1 ( 903 - 1125 aa ) , 56 and INF2 , which binds to aa 1181 - 1262 and aa 1051 - 1193 of what might be longer splice variants of mDia1 and mDia3 respectively . 50 Domain architecture diagrams were created using MyDomains Image Creator ( prosite . expasy . org / cgi - bin / prosite / mydomains / ) .

B16F1 cells with constitutively active mDia2 , 8 , 22 where the structures are packed with shorter microfilaments at their distal ends but contain relatively few long microfilaments that extend toward the base of the protrusions . 22 The high overexpression of constitutively active mDia2 could have resulted in endogenous mDia1 protein becoming a limiting factor on the process of filopodial microfilament elongation , giving rise to the club - shaped morphology of the filopodia . In addition , both full - length mDia2 and FH1FH2 - mDia2 localized mostly to the cytoplasm 7 , 8 — in these experiments it is likely that less of the protein was present in filopodia , and there was enough endogenous mDia1 to elongate the smaller number of short microfilaments generated , thus resulting in filopodia of even thickness along their shafts . These interpretations of the findings would further implicate mDia1 as the key mDia isoform that elongates microfilaments to form mature filopodia . It would be interesting to see if knocking out mDia1 affects mDia2 - driven filopodial protrusion — will the resulting mDia2 - induced filopodia be shorter in length ? mDia1 was seen throughout the shafts of filopodia when overexpressed alone or together with IRSp53 or constitutively active Rif in neuronal cells . 7 , 16 This is in contrast to the ‘ tip nucleation ’ model of filopodium formation , 1 where formins are expected to be found only at the tips of the protrusions . One possible explanation is that mDia1 dimers play a dual role in filopodium formation and are involved in not just polymerising the actin filaments but bundling them together as well . Another possibility is that filopodia consist of short , discontinuous actin filaments that do not span the entire length of the filopodial shaft . This has been shown by cryo - electron tomography studies to be the nature of the actin filaments that constitute Dictyostelium filopodia . 25 Superresolution microscopy studies would be able to reveal detail at the nanometre scale and help elucidate the specific locations of mDia1 and mDia2 , as well as other proteins associated with filopodial protrusion , within the structures with much greater accuracy . This would help in establishing a better understanding of the roles of these proteins in the various stages of filopodium formation . mDia Proteins in Filopodia Induced by Cdc42 and Rif The Rho GTPases Cdc42 and Rif regulate distinct pathways to filopodium formation . Cdc42 works through IRSp53 , which recruits to the plasma membrane the following proteins that modulate actin dynamics : N - WASP , Mena , WAVE2 and Eps8 . 26 The Rif pathway to filopodia does not require IRSp53 , N - WASP , Mena or WAVE2 . 7 As for the mDia proteins , mDia1 appears to be the only isoform common to both pathways . In the filopodia of neuronal cells overexpressing IRSp53 , mDia1 but not mDia2 was present , and was observed to interact with IRSp53 within the structures . 16 While both mDia1 and mDia2 were present in Rif filopodia , only mDia1 interacted with the RhoGTPase . 7 In addition , knockdown of either of these two isoforms resulted in a decrease in Rif - driven filopodium formation , 7 while IRSp53 filopodia were affected only by the silencing of mDia1 expression . 16 Taken together , it appears that mDia2 is not required for IRSp53 to form filopodia , and we have found that coexpressing mDia2 with IRSp53 leads to a loss of filopodia instead . 16 It remains to be seen as to why cells need two or even more - yet - undiscovered pathways to form filopodia , and why IRSp53 requires only mDia1 when Rif appears to require both mDia1 and mDia2 . Also , Rif has been shown to bind the GBD of mDia3 , however the significance of this interaction has yet to be investigated . 27 mDia1 11 , 27 and possibly mDia2 28 are involved in stress fiber formation in addition to filopodial protrusion . These two types of actin - based cellular structures appear to be linked — in fish fibroblasts , microfilaments in filopodia can become incorporated into stress fibers , 29 and it has been suggested that the reverse might occur in rat embryonic fibroblasts , with the actin freed up by the dissolution of stress fibers facilitating the protrusion of filopodia . 30 Rif interacts with both mDia1 and mDia2 27 and is able to trigger the formation of both filopodia 7 , 9 and stress fibers . 27 The dual role of these three proteins might point to a major role for them in controlling the balance between these two types of actin structures in cell migration . Conclusions It is clear that mDia proteins play an important role in mammalian filopodium formation . mDia2 appears to be specific for the Rif - mediated pathway whereas mDia1 is required for the pathways controlled by Cdc42 and Rif . It remains to be seen how exactly Rif utilizes two different formins , mDia1 and mDia2 , to form filopodia . How Rif couples membrane deforma - tion with actin dynamics to give rise to these structures has also yet to be resolved . Apart from mDia1 and mDia2 , are there other proteins specific to the Rif pathway to filopodium formation ? What potential roles do IRSp53 family proteins ( IRTKS , MIM , ABBA and PinkBar ) play in filopodial protru - sion ? These are some of the important questions to address in future studies on mammalian filopodia .
