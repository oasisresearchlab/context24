Retromer , an adaptor complexintheendosome - to - Golgiretrievalpathway , hasbeenimplicatedinAPPtransportbecauseretromerdeficiencyleadstoaberrant APP sorting and processing and levels of retromer proteins are altered in AD . Here we report that sorLA and retromer functionally interact in neurons to control trafficking and amyloidogenic processing of APP . We have identified a sequence ( FANSHY ) in the cyto - plasmicdomainofsorLAthatisrecognizedbytheVPS26subunitoftheretromercomplex . Accordingly , wecharacterizedtheinteraction between the retromer complex and sorLA and determined the role of retromer on sorLA - dependent sorting and processing of APP . Mutations in the VPS26 binding site resulted in receptor redistribution to the endosomal network , similar to the situation seen in cells withVPS26knockdown . ThesorLAmutantretainedAPP - bindingactivitybut , asopposedtothewild - typereceptor , misdirectedAPPinto a distinct non - Golgi compartment , resulting in increased amyloid processing . In conclusion , our data provide a molecular link between reduced retromer expression and increased amyloidogenesis as seen in patients with sporadic AD . Introduction Elevated production of the amyloid (cid:1) ( A (cid:1) ) peptide is widely accepted as a neurotoxic event in Alzheimer’s disease ( AD ) ( Haass and Selkoe , 2007 ) . A (cid:1) is generated by sequential enzy - matic cleavages of amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) by (cid:1) - and (cid:2) - secretases . In an alternative non - amyloidogenic pathway , APP is processed by the (cid:3) - secretase enzyme that clips within the A (cid:1) peptide , thereby precluding amyloid formation . Increasing evi - dence suggests that intracellular APP trafficking determines the access of APP to the respective secretases and thereby regulates the balance between amyloidogenic and non - amyloidogenic pro - cessing ( Sannerud and Annaert , 2009 ) . Thus , dissecting the APP trafficking pathway is of critical importance for understanding how A (cid:1) is formed . sorLA ( alternatively named LR11 or SORL1 ) is a 250 kDa member of the VPS10p - domain receptor family of type - 1 sorting receptors ( Willnow et al . , 2008 ) . We and others have shown that sorLA binds APP and retains it in the Golgi compartment , thereby preventing processing of the precursor into A (cid:1) ( Ander - sen et al . , 2005 , 2006 ; Offe et al . , 2006 ; Schmidt et al . , 2007 ; Dodson et al . , 2008 ; Rohe et al . , 2008 ) . Accordingly , single nucle - otide polymorphisms in SORL1 , the gene encoding sorLA , are associatedwithlate - onsetAD , andsorLAexpressionisreducedin vulnerable brain regions of AD patients ( Scherzer et al . , 2004 ; Andersen et al . , 2005 ; Dodson et al . , 2006 ; Rogaeva et al . , 2007 ) . Although the significance of sorLA for controlling APP trans - port and processing is well appreciated , little is known about the molecular mechanisms that guide the receptor through the intra - cellular compartments . Trafficking of sorLA is likely to be regu - lated by a complex system of cytoplasmic adaptor proteins that bind to specific target sequences within the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor . This assumption is supported by the observation that VPS10p , the yeast homolog of sorLA , requires the retromer com - plex for proper sorting ( Seaman et al . , 1997 , 1998 ) . In mammals , retromer is composed of at least five different proteins arranged in two subcomplexes comprising VPS26 , VPS29 , and VPS35 ( the VPS trimer ) and a dimer of two sorting nexin proteins ( SNX1 or SNX2 with SNX5 or SNX6 ) ( Seaman , 2005 ; Wassmer et al . , ReceivedMay6 , 2011 ; revisedSept . 30 , 2011 ; acceptedNov . 28 , 2011 .

The cargo binding activity of retromer is assigned to the VPS trimer , and , in all cases in which this has been studied , bind - ing is mediated by the VPS35 subunit ( Collins , 2008 ) . The retromer complex is essential for normal cellular func - tion , as illustrated by the embryonic lethality of knock - out mice devoid in VPS26 or in SNX1 and SNX2 expression ( Lee et al . , 1992 ; Schwarz et al . , 2002 ) . Previous studies have also suggested that retromer is engaged in binding and trafficking of the mam - malian sorLA protein ( Lane et al . , 2010 ) because knockdown of either VPS35 or SNX1 results in reduced sorLA expression ( Nielsen et al . , 2007 ) . Similarly to sorLA , expression of the retromer component VPS35 is decreased in vulnerable regions of AD brains , but the mechanism by which retromer influences onset of disease re - mains poorly understood ( Small et al . , 2005 ) . However , recent studies reported that retromer deficiency in mice and flies in - creases the production of A (cid:1) ( Muhammad et al . , 2008 ) , likely by impact on APP sorting ( Vieira et al . , 2010 ) . Because the retromer complex does not interact directly with APP , we speculated that sorLA is the molecular link between retromer function and APP processing . We provide evidence for a direct link between sorLA and retromer and suggest a model on how they jointly prevent APP from entering the amyloidogenic pathway . Materials and Methods Antibodies .

DNA constructs and recombinant proteins . The construct encoding the full - length sorLA – FANSHY 3 6A mutant was generated by site - directed mutagenesis of the human sorLA cDNA in pcDNA3 . 1zeo ( (cid:1) ) vector us - ing primers 5 - GCA GCT TCA CCG CCG CTG CCG CAG CGG CAG CTA GCT CCA GGC - 3 and 5 - GGC AAC TAG AAG GCA CAG TCG AGG - 3 , and , accordingly , 5 - GCC TGG AGC TAG CTG CCG CTG CGG CAG CGG CGG TGA AGC TGC - 3 and 5 - CTT GCA AAC GTC ACT GCT GCC TCC - 3 . The wild - type ( WT ) sorLA fragment was replaced by the mutated PCR fragment via SfuI and XhoI . The CD8 ED – sor - LA CD – WT construct was made as described previously ( Seaman , 2004 ) , involving PCR amplification of the cytoplasmic tail of WT sorLA and adding an AflII site to form an in - frame fusion with human CD8 (cid:3) . Thus , the cytoplasmic domain of sorLA was joined to the lumenal domain of CD8 (cid:3) . Site - directed mutagenesis of the sorLA tail was accomplished usingtheQuikChangekitbyStratagene , followingtheinstructionsofthe manufacturer . H6Ubi - tail proteins were produced in Escherichia coli BL21 / DE3 pL - ysSasdescribedpreviously ( Andersenetal . , 2000 ) .

The quality of the H6Ubi - tail proteins was tested by SDS - PAGE analysis . The human VPS26A protein ( GenBank accession number NP _ 004887 ) was expressed with a C - terminal histidine tag by using the pET11a vector ( Novagen ) and purified from E . coli lysate on Talon beads ( Invitrogen ) . The GGA1 – VHS domain was produced as described pre - viously ( Cramer et al . , 2010 ) . A vector for short - hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) knockdown of VPS26 was prepared based on the siRNA sequence against VPS26 ( AAU GAU GGG GAA ACC AGG AAA ) , the BLOCK - iT Inducible H1 RNAi Entry Vector kit ( Invitrogen ) , and a pair of oligonucleotides . The oligos used were as follows : 5 (cid:2) - CACC AAT GAT GGG GAA ACC AGG AAA GAGA TTT CCT GGT TTC CCC ATC ATT - 3 (cid:2) ( top strand ) and 5 (cid:2) - AAAA AAT GAT GGG GAA ACC AGG AAA TCTC TTT CCT GGT TTC CCC ATC ATT - 3 (cid:2) ( bottom strand ) . APP metabolism . SH - SY5Y cells were cultured in DMEM F - 12 ( Invit - rogen ) supplemented with 10 % FBS and 5 % penicillin / streptomycin . To obtain stable cell lines , SH - SY5Y cells were transfected using HiFect ( Amaxa ) with constructs encoding sorLA – WT or sorLA – FANSHY 3 6A . Transfected cells were selected by adding 300 (cid:4) g / ml zeocin ( Invitrogen ) tothemedium48haftertransfection . DeterminationofAPPmetabolism was performed using the endogenous level of APP expression in the stable transfected SH - SY5Y cells .

Equal amounts of protein from cells and medium were suspended in SDS loading buffer and loaded onto 4 – 16 % SDS - PAGE , followed by WB . The nitrocellulose membranes ( GE Healthcare ) were probed for sorLA , holo - APP , and ac - tin . The A (cid:1) 1 – 40 level was determined by ELISA ( Invitrogen ) . Cell surface biotinylation . SH - SY5Y cell lines stably expressing either sorLA – WT or sorLA – FANSHY 3 6A were grown in six - well plates and used at 80 % confluency . Cells were washed twice with ice - cold PBS and incubated for 30 min on ice with PBS containing 1 mg / ml EZ - linked sulfo - NHS - S - biotin ( Pierce ) . Biotinylation was quenched by 20 min of incubation with 100 m M glycine . The quenching buffer was removed by washing in PBS , and the cells were lysed in lysis buffer ( PBS , 1 % Triton X - 100 , and 0 . 1 % SDS ) supplemented with Complete proteinase inhibi - tor ( Roche ) . To precipitate the biotinylated proteins , cell lysates were incubated with streptavidin beads ( GE Healthcare ) overnight at 4°C . After incubation , the beads were washed three times in PBS before being eluted with 50 (cid:4) l of SDS sample buffer and incubated at 98°C for 5 min . The total protein fraction ( 20 (cid:4) g of sorLA – WT or sorLA – FANSHY 3 6A ) and the cell surface fraction ( 20 (cid:4) l of sorLA – WT and sorLA – FANSHY 3 6A ) wereloadedontoSDS - PAGE ( 4 – 16 % ) , followedby WB .

A pulse - chase experiment was per - formedusing1 . 5 (cid:3) 10 6 ofSH - SY5YcellsstablyexpressingsorLA – WTor sorLA – FANSHY 3 6A . The cells were incubated in cysteine and methione - free medium ( Sigma ) for 15 min before metabolic labeling [ 200 (cid:4) Ci / ml L - [ 35 S ] cysteine and L - [ 35 S ] methione ( Pro - mix ; GE Health - care ) in the presence of 1 (cid:3) Glutamax ( Sigma ) ] for 40 min . Thereafter , the cells were washed in PBS and incubated in complete DMEM and chased for the indicated times , followed by cell lysis . sorLA – WT and sorLA – FANSHY 3 6A were immunoprecipitated using Gamma - bind Sepharose beads ( GE Healthcare ) coated with rabbit serum against sol – sorLA . The precipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS - PAGE , followed by autoradiography . As described previously ( Seaman , 2007 ) , determination of the CD8 ED – sorLA CD – WT and mutant stability was performed in the pres - ence of cycloheximide , except that the cells were grown in 90 mm tissue culture dishes and were treated with cycloheximide for 4 h . Confocal microscopy . With the purpose of studying colocalization of sorLA with different marker proteins , we used primary hippocampal neuronal cultures and human SH - SY5Y cell lines stably expressing either sorLA – WT or sorLA – FANSHY 3 6A . Furthermore , we used SH - SY5Y cells transiently transfected with either CD8 ED – sorLA CD – WT or CD8 ED – sorLA CD – FANSHY 3 6A in combination with sorLA – WT , sorLA – FANSHY 3 6A , sorLA – F 12 3 A , sorLA – FTAF 3 4A , and sorLA – Y 17 3 F .

The cells were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 10 min , after which the paraformaldehyde was removed by washing three times in PBS . The cells were then permeabil - ized for 30 min by incubation in PBS containing 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 . Next , cells were blocked for 30 min in blocking buffer [ PBS containing 10 % fetalcalfserum ( FCS ) ] . Afterblocking , thecellswereincubatedwith primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer for 2 h at room tempera - ture or overnight at 4°C . The cells were then washed three times in PBS and incubated with secondary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature in the dark . The cells were imaged using a Carl Zeiss confocal LSM 510 META laser microscope with 40 (cid:3) , NA 1 . 2 C - Apochromat objectives ( Carl Zeiss ) . Endosome - to - Golgi retrieval of CD8 ED – sorLA CD – WT and CD8 ED – sorLA CD – FTAF 3 4A was investigated using the antibody - uptake assay as described previously ( Seaman , 2004 , 2007 ) . In this assay , cells express - ingtheCD8 - reporterconstructofinterestwereincubatedwithanti - CD8 antibody continuously for 3 h .

TheplasmidcontainingmCherryand GFP - tagged APP or sorLA were transfected into 70 – 80 % confluent PC12 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) . The day after transfection , the cells were seeded onto coverslips coated with Matrigel ( BD Biosci - ences ) . The cellswereincubatedinserum - freemediumsupplementedwith NGF ( 50 ng / ml ) 24 – 48 h before investigation . The cells were investigated using a Nikon E800 epifluorescence microscope , and images were captured using a CCD camera . Movies were generated by obtaining images at 1 frame / s with a 100 (cid:3) oil - immersion objective ( NA 1 . 4 ) . The vesicle move - ment was analyzed by generation of kymostacks using a homemade NIH ImageJ KymoToolbox plugin ( http : / / rsb . info . nih . gov / ij / ; available on re - quest at Fabrice . Cordelieres @ curie . fr ) . A number of vesicles was analyzed per condition ( APP , 354 vesicles ; sorLA – WT , 226 vesicles ; sorLA – FANSHY 3 6A , 287 vesicles ) over three experiments ( n (cid:5) 3 ) . Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy ( FLIM ) was conducted to determine FRET between APP and either sorLA – WT or the sorLA – FANSHY 3 6A mutant . The FLIM experiments of the cells were investi - gated on a Carl Zeiss confocal LSM 510 META laser microscope with a 40 (cid:3) , NA1 . 2C - Apochromatobjective . Thismicroscopeisequippedwith a mode - locked titanium – sapphire two - photon laser ( Mai - Tai ; Spectra Physics ) , photon counting card ( SPC830 ) , and associated software from Becker & Hickl ( SPCM program ) . APP was detected with antibody 8E5 and anti - rabbit labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 . Alexa Fluor 488 fluores - cence was detected with a PMC - 100 detector ( Hamamatsu ) after two - photon excitation at 800 nm . Images in the SPCM program were 256 (cid:3) 256 pixels in size and 256 time channels in depth , and they were acquired with the following settings in the LSM program : pixel dwell time , 1 . 6 (cid:4) s ; line average , 1 and 0 . 11 (cid:4) m / pixel ( zoom 4 ) . Fluorescence lifetime decay curves were collected in 10 cycles of 10 s . Lifetimes were measured for APP labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 in the presence and absence of sorLA – WT or sorLA – FANSHY 3 6A labeled with Alexa Fluor 543 , respectively . Lifetime curves were obtained from 10 – 15 cells . The fluorescence decay curves were fitted to a monoexpo - nentialdecayfunctioninSPCImage ( Becker & Hickl , version2 . 9 . 4 . 1993 ) with bin set to 1 ( 3 (cid:3) 3 pixels ) and amplitude threshold set to 25 . The scatter parameter was fixed to 0 , and all other parameters were left free . As instrument response function , we used the one automatically calcu - lated by SPCImage . Proximity ligation assay . According to protocol ( So¨derberg et al . , 2006 ) , the localization and interactions between endogenous APP and sorLA – WT or the sorLA – FANSHY 3 6A mutant were analyzed using a proximity ligation assay ( PLA ) . SH - SY5Y cells transfected with sorLA – WT or sorLA – FANSHY 3 6A were fixed on coverslips with 4 % paraformaldehyde , and membranes were permeabilized with 0 . 5 % sapo - nin . The cells were incubated overnight at 4°C with mouse anti - sorLA ( 20C11 ) andrabbitanti - APP ( Cterminal ) .

Large - scaleanti - CD8nativeIPswereperformedasaboveusingsix140 mm dishes of cells for each CD8 reporter . After washing , the IPs were combined into a spin column ( one column per CD8 reporter ) , and the bound proteins were eluted using 2 (cid:3) 150 (cid:4) l aliquots of 200 m M glycine - HCl , pH 2 . 3 . After elution , the proteins were precipitated by addition of 1 . 2 ml of ice - cold acetone . After precipitation with acetone , the precipi - tated proteins were dried in a Speed - Vac and then prepared for liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry analysis as described previously ( Harbour et al . , 2010 ) . Peptide pull - downs and mass spectrometry . Peptides containing the cy - tosolic tail of human sorLA were purchased from Eurogentec and dis - solved in ultra - pure water ( 1 mg of peptide in 200 (cid:4) l of H 2 O ) . Peptide 1 was soaked in 4 (cid:4) l of DMSO before dissolving in water . According to the SulfoLinkmanual ( Pierce ) , thepeptideswerethencoupledtoiodoacetyl - activated agarose ( SulfoLink Coupling Resin ; Pierce ) . As a control for unspecific resin binding , one batch of beads was treated in parallel but without addition of the peptide . The binding efficiency was estimated by applyingaBCAassayonthepeptidesolutionbeforeandaftercouplingtotheSepharose . A (cid:4) 90 % decrease in signal ( and a decrease of peptide in solution therewith ) was considered as efficient coupling . After the cou - pling , free binding sites were blocked by 50 m M cysteine . Animals were killed , and kidneys were removed rapidly , rinsed briefly in PBS , and homogenized with an Ultra - Turrax ( IKA ) in 1 ml of ice - cold RIPA buffer ( 0 . 2 % SDS , 0 . 1 % sodium deoxycholate , 1 % NP - 40 , 150 m M NaCl , 50 m M Tris - HCl , 2 m M 2 - mercaptoethanol , and 5 m M EDTA , pH 7 . 4 ) or DOC buffer ( 10 % sodium deoxycholate and 500 m M Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 4 ) per 50 mg of tissue . The homogenates were incubated on ice for 10 min before they were sonicated . To enrich cytosolic proteins , the lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 126 . 200 (cid:3) g for 30 min at 4°C . Protein concentrations were estimated by performing a BCA assay ( with comparison with a BSA standard ) . One milligram of protein was incu - bated overnight at 4°C with 50 (cid:4) l of settled peptide - coupled resin . Next , the column was washed five times for 5 min with 1 ml of either RIPA or DOCbuffer .

For electron microscopy , cells were fixed with 2 % formaldehyde and 0 . 1 % glutaraldehyde in 0 . 01 M PBS , pH 7 . 4 , for 10 min at room temperature . The cells were washed three times and removed with a rubber policeman in the same buffer containing 1 % gelatin ( Merck ) . The cells were then pelleted and embedded in 12 % gelatin , infiltrated with 2 . 3 M sucrose in PBS for 30 min , and , finally , frozen in liquid nitrogen . Ultrathin cryosections ( 70 (cid:8) 90 nm ) were obtained with an FCS Reichert Ultracut S cryo - ultramicrotome at (cid:9) 100°C and collected on 200 mesh nickel grids . The sections were incu - bated overnight with a polyclonal rabbit anti - sol – sorLA antibody at 1 : 1000 before 2 h of incubation with goat anti - rabbit gold ( 10 nm ) ( Bio - Cell ) . All incubations were performed at 4°C . Finally , the sections were contrasted with methyl cellulose containing 0 . 3 % uranylacetate and studied in a Philips CM100 electron microscope . Results Retromer binds and regulates the localization of sorLA Expression of sorLA and retromer has been detected previously in a subset of neuronal cells within the mammalian brain . To determine whether these proteins colocalize , we performed im - munostaining for sorLA and the retromer proteins VPS35 and SNX1 in primary hippocampal cultures . We observe that sorLA and the two retromer proteins partly overlap in a perinuclear compartment ( Fig . 1 A ) . Noticeably , not all cells stained for sorLA , which is in line with the previously shown heterogeneous cellular pattern of sorLA immunostaining of brain , including hippocampus ( Motoi et al . , 1999 ) . Based on the colocalization seen in hippocampal neurons , we decided to investigate whether the retromer complex regulates the intracellular distribution of sorLA . For that purpose , we pre - pared a shRNA knockdown vector against the human VPS26 protein and transfected the construct into SH - SY5Y cells to test for its ability to reduce VPS26 expression . As seen by WB , VPS26 and VPS35 protein expression were clearly visible in nontrans - fectedcells . However , VPS26wasundetectableincellstransfected with the shRNA vector ( Fig . 1 B ) . We also found that the level of VPS35 was decreased in VPS26 - depleted cells . This observation is in agreement with previous studies showing that VPS proteins of the cargo - selective subcomplex stabilize each other ( Arighi et al . , 2004 ; Seaman , 2004 ) ( Fig . 1 B ) .

SH - SY5Y cells were transfected with an expression vector for sorLA alone or cotransfected with the VPS26 shRNA knockdown vector . In the presence of functional retromer in single - transfected SH - SY5Y cells , sorLA was ob - served within the perinuclear region showing strong overlap with the Golgi marker ManII . However , in the retromer knockdown cells ( i . e . , double - transfected cells ) , the receptor displayed a more punctate and peripheral distribution ( Fig . 1 C ) . This change in sorLA localization suggests that retromer acts in the retrieval of sorLA from a peripheral compartment ( e . g . , early and / or recy - cling endosomes ) to the Golgi . Because knockdown of VPS26 alters sorLA distribution , we wanted to examine whether sorLA and retromer can physically interact . We therefore performed co - IP experiments using a chimeric reporter construct encoding the extracellular do - main ( ED ) of CD8 fused to the cytoplasmic domain ( CD ) of sorLA ( CD8 ED – sorLA CD – WT ) . Because previous reports described that the retro - mer complex associates with the cytoplas - mictailofthecation - independentmannose 6 - phosphate receptor ( CIMPR ) , we used a CD8 ED – CIMPR CD – WT fusion construct asapositivecontrol . Asnegativecontrol , we applied CD8 alone or a mutated variant ( CD8 ED – CIMPR CD – WLM 3 3A ) lacking the retromer binding site ( Seaman , 2007 ) . IP experiments were performed on lysates from transfected HeLa cells using an anti - CD8 antibody . As shown in Figure 1 D , theretromerproteinsVPS35andVPS26co - precipitated with CD8 ED – sorLA CD – WT and CD8 ED – CIMPR CD – WT but not with CD8 ED – CIMPR CD – WLM 3 3A or CD8 alone . These data provide evidence that ret - romerandsorLAphysicallyassociatewithincells ( Fig . 1 D ) . Identification of the retromer binding motif in sorLA To identify the retromer binding site in sorLA , we prepared overlapping 15 - mer peptides corresponding to the cytoplas - mic tail ( sorLA peptides 1 – 5 ; Fig . 2 A ) and coupled these peptides to Sepharose resin . The peptides were then incubated with homogenates of mouse kidney—a tissue shown to contain high levels of retromer and sorLA ( Reiche et al . , 2010 and data not shown ) —and bound proteins were eluted and analyzed by SDS - PAGE , fol - lowed by Coomassie staining . Prominent bands were subsequently identified by MS . Interestingly , we noticed that peptide 5 covering the sequence closest to the transmembrane domain of sorLA bound several proteins , including VPS26 ( Fig . 2 B ) . Notably , peptide 5 is rich in aromatic residues , including the di - phenylalanine motif FTAF ( Fig . 2 A ) . This sequence is similar to the FYVF motif in the yeast VPS10p receptor that is believed to medi - ate binding to the yeast retromer complex ( for review , see Seaman , 2008 ) . To test whether the aromatic residues present in peptide 5 are involved in retromer binding , we mutated the FTAF motif within the CD8 ED – sorLA CD – WT to a tetra - alanine sequence ( CD8 ED – sorLA CD – FTAF 3 4A ) . We then repeated the co - IP experiment in HeLa cells , comparing retromer precipitation for CD8 ED – sorLA CD – WT and CD ED – sorLA CD – FTAF 3 4A ( Fig . 2 C ) . We found that both VPS26 and VPS35 associated with the chimeric protein carrying the WT sorLA tail sequence ( Fig . 2 C ) . However , when the cytoplasmic FTAF motif was mutated , the interaction with retromer was abolished ( Fig . 2 C ) . Additionally , (cid:1) 1 - adaptin , a component of the clathrin AP - 1 complex , showed specific interaction with CD8 ED – CIMPR CD – WT but did not bind to sorLA . Notably , neither the tail of APP nor of the (cid:1) - site APP - cleaving enzyme ( BACE ) could precipitate components of the retromer in this assay ( Fig . 2 C ) . Figure 2 .

Fjorbacketal . • RetromerRegulatessorLARetrogradeTrafficking J . Neurosci . , January25 , 2012 • 32 ( 4 ) : 1467 – 1480 • 1471 Phenylalanine residue 12 ( F 12 ; numbering according to the tail sequence in Fig . 2 A ) is also part of an F X NP X Y - like motif known to function in the clathrin - dependent endocytosis path - way [ i . e . , for the low - density lipoprotein receptor ( Davis et al . , 1986 ) ] . Therefore , we prepared a sorLA mutant wherein the FANSHY hexa - peptide was substituted with six alanine residues . SH - SY5Y cells were transfected with either sorLA – WT or sorLA – FANSHY 3 6A constructs , and co - IP of the retromer was per - formed . Because co - IP of VPS35 was only seen for cells that expressed sorLA – WT ( Fig . 2 D ) , we conclude that aromatic resi - dues in sorLA are essential for binding the retromer complex . To further investigate the binding partners of the cytoplasmic domain of sorLA , we applied a large - scale IP assay using HeLa cells stably transfected with the CD8 ED – CIMPR CD – WT , CD8 ED – sorLA CD – WT , and CD8 ED – sorLA CD – FANSHY 3 6A mutant reporter constructs , respectively . Proteins immunopre - cipitated with anti - CD8 antibodies were subsequently analyzed by MS . As shown in Table 1 , peptides from the clathrin adaptor AP - 1 ( adaptins ) were detected in the CD8 ED – CIMPR CD – WT sample , along with peptides from the retromer protein VPS35 . The CD8 ED – sorLA CD – WT sample contained peptides from VPS35 , VPS26 , and VPS29 , but only one peptide from VPS35 was detected in the CD8 ED – sorLA CD – FANSHY 3 6A sample . Similar numbers of peptides from the CD8 (cid:3) protein , GAPDH , and elon - gation factor were present in all three samples , indicating that comparableamountsofmaterialwereanalyzedfromeachsample ( Table 1 ) . Next , we measured whether recombinant VPS26 can interactdirectlywiththe54aatailofsorLAusingsurfaceplasmonresonanceanalysis . Whereas the nonmutated cytoplasmic part of sorLA bound strongly to VPS26 , the tail of sorLA – FANSHY 3 6A failed to do so ( Fig . 2 E ) . However , both proteins bound to the GGA1 VHS domain shown previously to interact in a region that shares no overlap with the FANSHY motif ( Nielsen et al . , 2001 ; Cramer et al . , 2010 ) showing a specific disruption of the VPS26 binding site ( Fig . 2 F ) . Together , these data demonstrated that sorLA binds the VPS26 subunit of retromer and suggest that this interaction re - quires aromatic residues in the receptor tail . Lack of retromer binding alters the localization of sorLA – FANSHY 3 As We next investigated the effect of mutating the FANSHY se - quence on cellular distribution of sorLA . In this assay , SH - SY5Y cells were double transfected with different combinations of CD8 - reporter and full - length sorLA constructs to analyze the localization pattern of both proteins within the same cell . First , we transfected SH - SY5Y cells with the CD8 ED – sorLA CD – WT construct in combination with sorLA – WT ( Fig . 3 A ) . The cells were subsequently stained with antibodies against the ED of sorLA and the CD8 reporter . As expected , we found a strong colocalization between CD8 ED – sorLA CD – WT and sorLA – WT in a perinuclear Golgi - like compartment , demonstrating that the CD8 tag did not influence the subcellular distribution . Likewise , we found that CD8 ED – sorLA CD – FANSHY 3 6A and sorLA – FANSHY 3 6A robustly overlapped albeit in a more peripherally localized compartment ( Fig . 3 A ) . Notably , when combining the mutant sorLA – FANSHY 3 6A with CD8 ED – sorLA CD – WT , we observed only minor colocalization . Rather , the majority of sorLA – FANSHY 3 6A was observed in a peripheral and punctu - ate expression pattern ( Fig . 3 B ) . Transfection with the reverse constructs , i . e . , CD8 ED – sorLA CD – FANSHY 3 6A and sorLA – WT , showed a similar dispersed localization of the mutant recep - tor tail . In conclusion , sorLA – FANSHY 3 6A localize differently from sorLA – WT when transfected into the same cell . Because our biochemical experiments suggested a critical role for the sequences F 9 TAF 12 and F 12 ANSHY that share F 12 , we compared the subcellular distribution of CD8 ED – sorLA CD – WT with two mutants lacking either F 9 and F 12 ( sorLA – FTAF 3 4A ) or only F 12 ( sorLA – F 12 3 A ) ( compare with Fig . 2 A ) . In accor - dance with the in vitro data , substitutions in sorLA – FTAF 3 4A , butalsoinsorLA – F 12 3 A , shiftedthereceptordistributiontothe peripheral compartment similar to that observed for the sorLA – FANSHY 3 6A mutant ( Fig . 3 C ) . In comparison , mutating ty - rosine 17 in FANSHY to a phenylalanine ( sorLA - Y 17 3 F ) did not influence the perinuclear expression pattern . Collectively , we therefore conclude that F 12 in the receptor tail is important for retromer to control sorLA sorting . To establish that the aberrant subcellular distribution of the mutants was a consequence of deficient retromer binding , we cotransfected the SH - SY5Y cells with the shRNA construct to knock down expression of VPS26 . In the presence of functional retromer , CD8 ED – sorLA CD – WT was confined to the perinuclear region , but transfection with the VPS26 shRNA clearly redistrib - uted the receptor to a more distal and dispersed compartment in which it colocalized with the sorLA – FANSHY 3 6A mutant ( Fig . 3 D ) . These data strongly suggest a functional link between retro - mer , its binding to the FANSHY sequence , and sorting of sorLA . Immunoelectron microscopy analysis of WT and mutant sorLA To examine the protein localization in more detail , we performed immunoelectron microscopy on cells stably transfected with ei - ther sorLA – WT or sorLA – FANSHY 3 6A constructs . Unfortu - nately , despite several attempts , we did not succeed in generating a stable cell line that expressed sorLA – F 12 3 A . However , because the F 12 3 A and FANSHY 3 6A mutations had similar cellular localization patterns as shown in the CD8 - reporter experiment ( cf . Fig . 3 B ) , all subsequent studies were performed using the FANSHY 3 6A mutant line . In agreement with the confocal IF data , immunoelectron microscopy revealed that sorLA – WT re - sides partly in Golgi compartments but also in large multivesicu - lar bodies in the vicinity of the nucleus , whereas only small amounts of the WT receptor were present in peripheral compart - ments except for pronounced labeling of the plasma membrane ( Fig . 3 E ) . In contrast , the majority of sorLA – FANSHY 3 6A was Table1 .

Reduced expression of sorLA – FANSHY 3 6A at the cell surface The immunoelectron microscopy data also revealed low abun - dance of sorLA – FANSHY 3 6A at the plasma membrane when compared with the WT receptor ( Fig . 4 A ) . To quantitatively de - termine surface expression of the sorLA variants , we incubated the transfected SH - SY5Y cells with a membrane - impermeable biotin reagent at 4°C . A fraction of the total cell lysates and the biotinylated protein were resolved by SDS - PAGE analysis , and sorLA expression was determined by WB ( Fig . 4 B ) . Quantifica - tion of these bands demonstrated 48 . 3 (cid:8) 2 . 7 % less sorLA – FANSHY 3 6A at the plasma membrane compared with the level of sorLA – WT . We then speculated about whether the low cell - surface ex - pression of sorLA – FANSHY 3 6A might be a consequence of def - icits in the secretory pathway , leading to less mature receptor reaching the cell surface . To test this hypothesis , we examined receptor maturation using a pulse - chase protocol . The kinetics of receptor maturation ( i . e . , the acquisition of glycosylation ) was indistinguishable between sorLA – WT and sorLA – FANSHY 3 6A as shown by a similar pattern of high and low glycosylated sorLA ( Fig . 4 C ) . When sorLA reaches the plasma membrane , some receptor molecules can undergo cleavage by metalloproteases , leading to secretionofthesolubleEDintothemedium ( Hampeetal . , 2000 ) . The time needed to reach the cell surface can be estimated by quantification of secreted soluble sorLA from the pulse - chase experiment . Accordingly , we immunoprecipitated newly synthe - sized and shed EDs from the cell culture medium at 60 , 90 , 120 , Figure 3 .

Neither the sorLA – WT nor sorLA – FANSHY 3 6A EDs were secreted after 60 min chase , but EDs from both proteins were secreted to a similar extent at later time points , i . e . , 120 and 240 min ( Fig . 4 D ) . Together , these experiments suggest that anterograde transport of newly synthe - sized sorLA to the cell surface was not affected by mutation of the FANSHY motif in the cytoplasmic tail . sorLA – FANSHY 3 6A mutant fails to enter the endosomal sorting pathway We next investigated whether enhanced endocytic uptake and delivery to lysosomes for degradation might account for the im - paired surface exposure of the sorLA – FANSHY 3 6A mutant . Ac - cordingly , we metabolically labeled SH - SY5Y cells expressing either sorLA – WT or sorLA – FANSHY 3 6A for 40 min and chased proteins for the following 48 h . However , we failed to detect any major difference in turnover between the WT and mutant receptor ( Fig . 4 E ) . These data suggest that the mutant does not exhibit increased lysosomal targeting and degradation in SH - SY5Y cells ( Fig . 4 E ) . The predominant expression of sorLA – FANSHY 3 6A in small electron - dense vesicles near the plasma membrane led us to suggest that the mutant might be impaired in retrograde traffick - ing from tubular endosomal network ( TEN ) and back to the Golgi , a pathway that is critically dependent on the retromer complex . First , we studied colocalization of sorLA – WT and sorLA – FANSHY 3 6A with the Golgi markers ManII and TGN46 ( Fig . 4 F ) . Remarkably , we found only a modest overlap between sorLA – FANSHY 3 6A and ManII and TGN46 , whereas sor - LA – WT showed a much more pronounced colocalization ( Fig . 4 F ) in line with the speculated defect in retrograde transport of the mutant . Second , we used an antibody uptake protocol in which we labeled the chimeric proteins using an anti - CD8 antibody at the cell surface ( Seaman , 2007 ) and studied internalization of the CD8 ED – sorLA CD – WT and CD8 ED – sorLA CD – FTAF 3 4A re - porters in HeLa cells . In keeping with impaired retrograde traf - ficking , we found that antibody bound to CD8 ED – sorLA CD – WT was endocytosed and delivered to the trans - Golgi compartment ( TGN46 - positive ) , whereas the CD8 ED – sorLA CD – FTAF 3 4A fusion protein accumulated in punctate structures ( Fig . 4 G ) . A similar observation was made for the CD8 ED – sorLA CD – FANSHY 3 6A reporter ( data not shown ) , confirming that the aromatic motif is responsible for trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) retrieval . In addition to mediating retrograde transport back to the Golgi , the TEN is also implicated in redirecting some receptor molecules back to the plasma membrane via recycling vesicles . If sorLA – FANSHY 3 6A accumulates within the tubular compart - ment as a result of deficient association with retromer , one could speculate that over time ( steady - state ) that less soluble sorLA would be released into the medium ( as opposed to shedding of newly synthesized receptors ; see the pulse - chase experiment in Fig . 4 D ) . Despite almost identical expression of sorLA – WT and sorLA – FANSHY 3 6A in the stably transfected SH - SY5Y cells , we consistently detected (cid:7) 30 % less shedding of the mutant receptor when compared with the WT receptor ( p (cid:6) 0 . 0001 ) ( Fig . 4 H ) . These data suggest that recycling of sorLA – FANSHY 3 6A back tothecellsurfaceisimpaired . Fromthesestudies , weelaborateon a previously described model ( Nielsen et al . , 2007 ; Schmidt et al . , 2007 ) in which sorLA moves through the secretory pathway to reach the cell surface . Our new studies suggest that , after inter - nalization , sorLA is recycled back to the Golgi via the TEN—a sorting step that requires binding of VPS26 of the retromer com - plex to the FANSHY sequence in sorLA . sorLA – FANSHY 3 6A interacts with APP We have demonstrated previously that sorLA can bind to and retain APP in the Golgi compartment , thereby preventing pro - cessing of APP via both amyloidogenic and non - amyloidogenic pathways ( Andersen et al . , 2005 ; Schmidt et al . , 2007 ) . Because retromer deficiency increases the amyloidogenic degradation of APP ( Small et al . , 2005 ; Muhammad et al . , 2008 ) , we asked whether the sorLA – FANSHY 3 6A mutant might affect the sub - cellular localization and sorting of APP . We first performed double - IF microscopy for sorLA – FANSHY 3 6A and APP in the transfected SH - SY5Y cells . The proteins exhibited a high degree of colocalization in the perinu - clear region but notably also in the peripheral punctate structures ( data not shown ) . This observation we corroborated using a PLA . In brief , an immunostaining was performed in which the second - ary antibodies were tagged with oligonucleotides that can hybrid - ize and be PCR amplified when antigens are within a distance of 40 nm . The resulting DNA strands were visualized by hybridiza - tion of fluorescently labeled oligonucleotides . Staining with the anti - sorLA and anti - APP antibodies generated a strong signal for both sorLA – WT and sorLA – FANSHY 3 6A ( Fig . 5 A ) . Notably , althoughthesignalforsorLA – WTandAPPwasvisibleinaregion close to the nucleus , it seemed that sorLA – FANSHY 3 6A and APP proximity was scattered throughout the cell , in line with the dispersed distribution of the mutant receptor ( cf . Fig . 3 A ) . In additional experiments , we used FLIM to analyze the direct interaction of sorLA – WT and sorLA – FANSHY 3 6A with APP . In cells expressing APP alone , the lifetime of Alexa Fluor 488 - labeled APP in the absence of acceptor Alexa Fluor 543 - labeled sorLA was 2163 (cid:8) 127 ps ( n (cid:5) 14 ) . This lifetime was shortened to 1979 (cid:8) 182 ps ( n (cid:5) 15 ; p (cid:6) 0 . 004 ) in the presence of labeled sorLA . A similar reduction in the lifetime to 1982 (cid:8) 116 ps ( n (cid:5) 13 ; p (cid:6) 0 . 001 ) was found for the APP - conjugated donor in the presence of sorLA – FANSHY 3 6A , indicating that mutation within the cytoplasmic domain of sorLA had little effect on the complex formation between sorLA and APP ( Fig . 5 B ) . We conclude that retromer is required for trafficking of sorLA but not for formation of the sorLA : APP complex . Accordingly , the sorLA mutant devoid in retromer binding is able to redistrib - ute APP to a compartment with a similar morphology to the TEN . sorLA affects the trafficking of APP Finally , we set out to investigate how sorLA – WT and sorLA – FANSHY 3 6A affect the vesicular transport of APP using time - 4 ( Figurelegendcontinued . ) ( streptavidinbeads ) relativetothetotalexpressionlevel ( input ) in SH - SY5YcellsshownbyrepresentativeWB .

Because previous studies had shown that sorLA – WT significantly reduces the velocity of the exit of a photo - activatable GFP – APP fusion protein from the perinuclear region ( Schmidt et al . , 2007 ) , we studied whether sorLA – FANSHY 3 6A possesses a similar ability to reduce the speed of APP . We first transfected differentiated PC12 cells with APP – EGFP and sorLA – RFP constructs to validate that sorLA impairs APP trafficking . Not only did we observe a strong colocalization of sorLA – WT and APP within a subset of transport vesicles in the perinuclear region ( Fig . 5 C ) , we also noticed a strongly reduced velocity of vesicles containing both sorLA – RFP and APP – EGFP compared with vesicle containing only APP – EGFP ( data not Figure5 .

In a second round of experiments , we compared neurite dynamics of APP – EGFP alone or after cotransfection with either sorLA – WT or sorLA – FANSHY 3 6A . In the absence of sorLA expression , the majority of APP - containing vesicles were moving both retrogradely and anterogradely as shown by the kymograph ( Fig . 5 C ) . On the contrary , coexpression of sorLA – WT retarded transport of almost all APP - containing vesicles , reducing the cu - mulative distance traveled from 30 . 8 to 8 . 3 (cid:4) m and the mean speedofvesiclesfrom0 . 15to0 . 03 (cid:4) m / s ( Fig . 5 D ) . Remarkably , in the presence of sorLA – FANSHY 3 6A , movement of APP - containing vesicles were identical to the APP in mock - transfected cells . These data suggest that sorLA only slows down APP traffick - ing if the receptor resides in the Golgi apparatus . The sorLA – FANSHY 3 6A mutant does not protect against APP processing We next compared the impact of sorLA – WT and sorLA – FANSHY 3 6A on APP processing . To do so , we first compared endogenous APP expression in parental SH - SY5Y with cell lines transfected with either one of the two sorLA constructs . WB of total cell lysates using an antibody against the C - terminal end of APP revealed that levels of immature and mature APP were not grossly affected by either sorLA – WT or sorLA – FANSHY 3 6A ( Fig . 5 E ) . However , when investigating shedding of soluble APP in medium collected for 48 h , we found a 71 . 2 (cid:8) 6 . 2 % ( p (cid:6) 0 . 0001 ) reduction in secreted sAPP (cid:3) in sorLA – WT - expressing cells . Interestingly , the sorLA – FANSHY 3 6A mutant was signif - icantly less potent than the WT protein in preventing sAPP (cid:3) processing ( 54 . 0 (cid:8) 7 . 0 % ; p (cid:6) 0 . 01 ) compared with nontrans - fected cells ( Fig . 5 F ) . Finally , we measured A (cid:1) secretion using ELISA to determine the effect of the mutant receptor on the amyloidogenic process - ing pathway . By comparing the medium from nontransfected SH - SY5Ycells , wefounda30 . 8 (cid:8) 3 . 2 % reduction ( p (cid:5) 0 . 0001 ) in A (cid:1) production from cells that overexpress sorLA – WT . In con - trast , sorLA – FANSHY 3 6A did not offer any protection against A (cid:1) production , because the level of A (cid:1) in the conditioned me - dium was not significantly different from nontransfected cells ( Fig . 5 F ) . In conclusion , we have shown that sorLA is able to interact with retromer via VPS26 and this binding is necessary to retrieve to the Golgi complex . Aberrant sorLA trafficking by mutation in the FANSHY motif or loss of retromer function leads to altered APP processing and increased A (cid:1) production . Our findings sug - gest a functional link between the impaired retromer expression observed in some cases of sporadic AD and the increase in amy - loid burden . Discussion The precise sorting of APP during endocytosis is of critical im - portancefortheADpathologybecauseA (cid:1) generation ( i . e . , BACE cleavage ) occurs in the acidic environment of the endosome . Be - sides endosomal sorting of APP , enlarged / dysfunctional endo - somes have been implicated in AD progression , showing the importance of delineating sorting mechanisms of endosomal function ( Nixon , 2005 ) . This is supported by independent evi - dence that revealed altered expression of various sorting recep - tors and adaptors in AD ( Small and Gandy , 2006 ) . In particular , defects in retromer - mediated transport have been linked to AD development . Studies combining brain imag - ingtechniqueswithmicroarrayanalysisreportedreducedexpres - sion of VPS35 and VPS26 in sporadic AD brains ( Small et al . , 2005 ) . In addition , it has been proposed that retromer deficiency affects APP processing , thereby increasing A (cid:1) levels ( Small et al . , 2005 ; Muhammad et al . , 2008 ) . Co - IP studies have indicated that retromer and APP exist in a multiprotein complex , although a direct interaction between APP and any of the retromer compo - nents has not yet been identified ( Vieira et al . , 2010 ) . sorLA is member of a group of membrane proteins including sortilin , CIMPR , and the iron transporter DMT1 - II that undergo retromer - dependent transport from the endosomal compart - ments back to the Golgi . Recent studies have identified short peptide motifs required for retromer association . These motifs are highly hydrophobic and rich in aromatic amino acid residues , e . g . , the tripeptides FLV ( sortilin ) , WLM ( CIMPR ) , and YLL ( DMT1 - II ) , respectively ( Seaman , 2007 ; Tabuchi et al . , 2010 ) . However , up to now , the nature of the sorLA signal involved in retromer - dependent retrograde transport has not been eluci - dated ( Bonifacino and Hurley , 2008 ) . Here we demonstrate that retromer binds to an aromatic motif centered on F 12 located in the FANSHY motif in the sorLA cytoplasmic tail . This observa - tion is in accordance with the general view that retromer binding motifs contain aromatic residues . Interestingly , the binding of retromer to sortilin was mapped to the larger region of the sorti - lin cytoplasmic domain spanning the KKYVCGGR F LVHR Y SV - LQQHA sequence , containing the previously identified FLV tripeptide ( Canuel et al . , 2008 ) . Therefore , we speculate that the separation between the two aromatic residues in this sequence ( in bold ) exactly corresponds to the F ANSH Y motif , suggesting that these two aromatic residues may define a common recognition motif for retromer within the family of mammalian VPS10 receptors . Recognition of the FANSHY motif by retromer likely is medi - ated by the VPS26 subunit of the cargo - recognition VPS trimer . This is the first demonstration of a role for VPS26 in cargo bind - ing and is consistent with the structural studies of VPS26 that revealed an arrestin - like conformation for the VPS26 protein and predicted a possible cargo - binding activity by analogy with the arrestin family of proteins ( Shi et al . , 2006 ; Collins et al . , 2008 ) . Although studies in both yeast and mammalian cells have indi - cated that VPS35 is responsible for the cargo - binding activity of retromer ( Nothwehr et al . , 2000 ; Arighi et al . , 2004 ) , our data suggest that this is not the case with respect to sorLA binding . The role of the FANSHY motif in the sorLA cytoplasmic tail was investigated by mutagenesis . We found that sorLA – FANSHY 3 6A exhibits an altered cellular distribution to struc - tures that were similar to the localization observed in cells lacking the retromer complex ( Fig . 3 D ) . In conclusion , mutating sorLA in the FANSHY motif or removing the retromer complex both lead to accumulation of the receptor in vesicular structures . The localization of sorLA – FANSHY 3 6A was clearly changed to a more vesicular structure that was positive for neither markers of TGN , late endosomes , nor lysosomes ( data not shown ) . How - ever , the observed pattern was similar to the localization of the retromer subunits VPS26 ( Arighi et al . , 2004 ) , SNX1 ( Carlton et al . , 2004 ) , and SNX2 ( Carlton et al . , 2005 ) , which have been reported as tubules of the endosome , i . e . , the TEN ( Bonifacino and Rojas , 2006 ) . A caveat to our study is that no specific markers for the TEN are yet known and that identification of the compart - ment solely relies on its morphological appearance . Obviously , this problem represents a significant challenge for future studies . Therefore , we hypothesize that sorLA – FANSHY accumulates in the TEN , whereas sorLA – WT molecules can continuously un - dergo retromer - dependent retrograde transport back to the Golgi from the TEN ( step 5 ; Fig . 6 ) . Thus , the WT receptor can Fjorbacketal . • RetromerRegulatessorLARetrogradeTrafficking J .

Furthermore , our data suggest a model in which sorLA travels independently of retromer activity through the secretory pathway to the cell surface ( steps 1 – 3 ) . Also , endo - cytosis of sorLA by clathrin - coated pits into early / sorting endo - somes ( step 4 ) occurs independently of the retromer complex in line with previous findings that suggested that clathrin and ret - romer function in consecutive retrograde sorting steps ( Popoff et al . , 2007 ) . This model is supported by a recent study describing a sorLA – F 12 N 14 Y 17 3 As mutant , which did not change the rate of internalization ( Nielsen et al . , 2007 ) . sorLA – WT is primarily localized within the Golgi and TGN , in which it functions as a retention factor for APP ( Schmidt et al . , 2007 ) , resulting in less APP available for processing ( Andersen et al . , 2005 ; Offe et al . , 2006 ) . Therefore , a lack of sorLA retrieval from endosomes / TEN to the Golgi / TGN in the absence of retro - mer activity would lead to reduced sorLA binding to APP in the post - Golgi secretory pathway . Similarly , disrupting the interac - tion between sorLA and retromer by mutation of the FANSHY motif would also decrease the amount of sorLA in Golgi / TGN . Figure6 .

This mislocalization causes enhanced APP processing and increased A (cid:1) levels . We believe that the removal of a func - tional interaction between sorLA and retromer by mutagenesis of the binding site represents an excellent model to study the im - portance of retromer - mediated APP transport compared with the retromer - deficient situation ( Muhammad et al . , 2008 ) . The results of such studies may , however , be confounded by side ef - fects from retromer acting on third - party proteins also involved in APP processing , e . g . , BACE ( He et al . , 2005 ) . It is known that APP can be processed at the cell surface by (cid:3) - secretase , whereas uncleaved molecules can internalize and undergo cleavage by (cid:1) - secretase in the endocytic compartments . In cells that express sorLA – FANSHY 3 6A , we observed an in - crease in both sAPP (cid:3) and A (cid:1) levels , suggesting less protective receptor activity in the Golgi / TGN ( loss of function ) ( Fig . 5 ) . However , the increased expression of sorLA – FANSHY 3 6A within the endosomal system ( gain of function ) could alterna - tively associate with APP to reduce the exit of APP from the TEN , thereby enhancing the possibility of amyloidogenic cleavage within the acidic endosomal compartment . Also , a decrease of non - amyloidogenic cleavage at the cell surface could result from less APP trafficking from the TEN via recycling endosomes back to the plasma membrane . Currently , we are unable to distinguish between these two scenarios , and , in reality , both mechanisms could add to the observed differences . However , because sorLA – FANSHY 3 6A is also not able to lower the non - amyloidogenic processing , we believe that the reduced sorLA levels within the early compartments ( loss of function ) plays the major role in our model . In conclusion , the present study identifies amino acid residues in the cytoplasmic domain of sorLA essential for the interaction with components of the retromer complex . We show that disrup - tion of the FANSHY motif within sorLA leads to accumulation of the receptor in a distinct intracellullar compartment , most likely retromer - associated tubules of the TEN , which leads to increased A (cid:1) production as seen in AD patients suffering from low expres - sion levels of either sorLA or retromer .
