Newmyer and Sandra L . Schmid Department of Cell Biology , The Scripps Research Institute , La Jolla , California 92037 Abstract . Within the clathrin - coated vesicle ( CCV ) cy - cle , coat assembly drives the internalization of recep - tors from the cell surface and disassembly allows for the processing of internalized ligands . The heat shock cog - nate protein , hsc70 , has been implicated in regulating coat disassembly . We ﬁnd that in cells overexpressing ATPase - deﬁcient hsc70 mutants , uncoating of CCVs is inhibited in vivo , and the majority of unassembled cyto - solic clathrin shifts to an assembled pool that cofrac - tionates with AP1 and AP2 . Surprisingly , this assembled pool of coat proteins accumulates in the absence of cargo receptors , suggesting that disruption of hsc70 ac - tivity may cause misassembly of empty clathrin cages . The strongest effect of overexpression of hsc70 mutants is a block in transferrin receptor ( TfnR ) recycling , which cannot be accounted for by the degree of inhibi - tion of uncoating of endocytic CCVs . These results sug - gest that hsc70 participates in multiple transport and / or sorting events between endosomal compartments . Ad - ditionally , the mutant - expressing cells are defective at internalizing transferrin . In the most potent case , the initial rate of uptake is inhibited 10 - fold , and TfnR lev - els double at the cell surface . Our ﬁndings demonstrate that hsc70 indeed regulates coat disassembly and also suggest that this chaperone broadly modulates clathrin dynamics throughout the CCV cycle . Key words : Hsc70 • endocytosis • clathrin - coated ves - icles • transferrin receptor • recycling Introduction Receptor - mediated endocytosis ( RME ) 1 is driven by the clathrin - coated vesicle ( CCV ) cycle ( Schmid , 1997 ) . This cycle begins with the assembly of the coat proteins , AP2 , and clathrin into coated pits . AP2 complexes concentrate receptors and also mediate clathrin assembly at the plasma membrane ( PM ) ( Kirchhausen , 1999 ) . Clathrin assembles into a lattice - like structure and induces inward curvature of the pit as it grows with the successive addition of coat proteins . The coated pit invaginates and eventually de - taches from the PM , forming a coated vesicle ( Kirch - hausen , 2000 ) . The CCV cycle is completed when the coat components are released and recycled . One factor implicated in releasing coat proteins from CCVs is hsc70 . This chaperone was purified as a factor that released clathrin from isolated coated vesicles in an ATP - dependent manner ( Schlossman et al . , 1984 ) . More recently , hsc70 was also identified as a requirement for AP2 release from isolated CCVs ( Hannan et al . , 1998 ) . Hsc70 is a constitutive member of the heat shock protein family and is thought to function in multiple cellular pro - cesses , including the folding of nascent chain polypeptides , the translocation of proteins across membranes , and the prevention of protein aggregation under stress conditions ( Mayer and Bukau , 1998 ) . These diverse hsc70 activities are , in part , facilitated through interactions with a series of DnaJ - like proteins ( Kelley , 1999 ) . The supporting role played by DnaJ - like proteins is demonstrated by auxilin , which mediates the CCV uncoating reaction ( Ungewickell et al . , 1995 ) . Auxilin serves to recruit hsc70 to CCVs and concomitantly stimulates hsc70 ATPase activity ( Holstein et al . , 1996 ; Barouch et al . , 1997 ) . In its ADP - bound state , hsc70 exhibits high affinity for protein substrates , includ - ing clathrin ( Prasad et al . , 1994 ) . Hsc70 has been implicated in many cellular processes , but it has been difficult to establish these activities in vivo . To this end , an anti - hsc70 mAb was used in microinjection studies to characterize the involvement of hsc70 in the clathrin uncoating reaction in vivo ( Honing et al . , 1994 ) . Microinjection of anti - hsc70 caused a prolonged colocal - ization between internalized ligand and clathrin and an ac - J The online version of this article contains supplemental material .

These in vivo studies supported a role for hsc70 in CCV disassembly and suggested that it might have additional functions within the CCV cycle . However , due to the single cell nature of this assay , neither the accumulating coated structures nor the nature of the endocytic block could be further analyzed . An alternate approach was used to probe the cellular functions of the hsc70 - related protein BIP . Overexpres - sion of dominant interfering mutants of BIP was used to reveal its involvement in the maintenance of ER morphol - ogy in mammalian cells ( Hendershot et al . , 1995 ) . To ini - tially determine whether this approach could be used to explore hsc70 function in vivo , we generated and charac - terized several hsc70 ATPase domain mutants defective in CCV uncoating and found that they inhibited the wild - type hsc70 – mediated release of clathrin from isolated CCVs . We next examined the effect of overexpression of the dominant - interfering hsc70 mutants on the CCV cycle using assays that allow dissection of discrete events in en - docytosis . Our findings support a role for hsc70 in the clathrin uncoating reaction in vivo but , more strikingly , suggest novel roles for hsc70 in chaperoning cytosolic clathrin and in endosomal trafficking .

Polyclonal antibodies were kindly provided as follows : anticlathrin light chain from F . M . Brodsky , anti - MPR from S . Pfeffer , and anti – d adaptin from M . S . Robinson ( Cambridge University , Cambridge , MA ) . Anti - DnaK SPA - 880 and anti - hsp70 SPA - 810 were obtained from StressGen Biotechnologies . Additional chemicals were of reagent grade . Biotinylated transferrin ( BXX - Tfn ) was generated as described previ - ously ( Smythe et al . , 1992 ) . Preparation of cDNA Constructs Constructs BovHsc70 . pRSET . wt , encoding full - length hsc70 WT , and BovHsc70 . pT7 - 7 . D199S and BovHsc70 . pT7 - 7 . K71M , encoding 60 - kD NH 2 - terminal hsc70 mutant fragments , were generously supplied by D . B . Mc - Kay ( Stanford University , Stanford , CA ) . For protein expression , pT7 - 7 . Hsc70WT was generated using NdeI / HindIII sites to exchange the sequence encoding the full - length wild - type protein from pRSET . wt into the pT7 - 7 vector . DNA encoding the COOH - terminal domains of hsc70 was re - stored to the above truncated mutant constructs using NdeI / BlpI restriction sites . Full - length pT7 - 7 . Hsc70 . T204V was generated using QuikChange Mutagenesis kit ( Stratagene ) ( forward primer , GATTTAGGGGGT - GGCGTTTTTGATGTG ; reverse primer , CACATGAAAAACGCCAC - CCCCTAAATC ) . An HA tag was introduced at the NH 2 terminus of hsc70 by ligating a cassette of synthetic oligomers ( forward primer , CATGGA - GTATGATGTTCCTGATTATGCTCA ; reverse primer , TATGAGC - ATAATCAGGAACATCATACTCCA ) within the NdeI site of pT7 - 7 . Hsc70WT . For adenoviral expression , the XbaI - excised HA - hsc70 – encoding frag - ment of pT7 - 7 . HA - Hsc70 was subcloned into pADtet7 , which carries the tetracycline - regulated promoter . Mutations were introduced into this con - struct by swapping in the PstI - excised fragment from the corresponding mutant pT7 - 7 . Hsc70 . The generated constructs were sequenced to verify correct engineering by the The Scripps Research Institute Protein and Nu - cleic Acids Core Facility . Proteins CCVs were purified from either fresh or frozen bovine brain ( Hannan et al . , 1998 ) . Protein concentration was determined by Coomassie Protein Assay ( Pierce Chemical Co . ) . All recombinant proteins were expressed in BL21 ( DE3 ) and harvested by lysis in buffer A ( 20 mM Hepes , pH 7 , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM DTT , 0 . 5 mM PMSF ) supplemented with 25 mM KCl . Native hsc70 was purified from the first high speed supernatant obtained from the bovine brain CCV preparation . Native and recombinant hsc70 proteins , including HA - hsc70 , were purified by sequential chromatogra - phy first on Q - Sepharose ( 2 . 5 3 16 cm ; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) and then on ATP agarose ( catalogue no . 2767 ; 1 . 5 3 15 cm ; Sigma - Aldrich ) as described ( Schlossman et al . , 1984 ; Greene and Eisenberg , 1990 ) . The resulting protein was precipitated with 75 % ( NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 in the presence of 10 mM EDTA to promote the dissociation of ATP ( Buxbaum and Woodman , 1996 ) . Recombinant hsc70 was further purified by size ex - clusion chromatography on Superose S - 300 ( 1 . 5 3 95 cm ; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) in buffer A containing 100 mM KCl , followed by chromatography on Q - Sepharose ( 1 . 5 3 10 cm ) . Hsc70 was eluted with a 25 – 250 - mM KCl linear gradient in buffer A ( 200 ml , 1 ml / min ) . The latter column completely removed contaminating DnaK as verified by Western blotting . The molar extinction coefficient , e 1 % 5 6 . 2 , was used to quantify native and recombinant hsc70 . Adenoviral Expression of Hsc70 WT and Mutant Proteins in tTA HeLa Cells Adenoviruses carrying the hsc70 genes were prepared from the pADtet7 hsc70 constructs as described earlier ( Hardy et al . , 1997 ; Altschuler et al . , 1998 ) . Within this expression system , the gene is introduced under the control of a tetracycline - repressible promoter . For all of the assays de - scribed below , subconfluent dishes of cells were infected for 2 h with the respective viruses at 400 pfu / cell and were subsequently incubated in fresh DME / 10 % FBS for 16 h . Fractionation Procedures Oligomerization of Endogenous Hsc70 . For analysis of hsc70 oligomeriza - tion , 2 3 10 6 cells were infected on 10 - cm dishes . After infection , the cells were released with PBS plus 5 mM EDTA , washed once with ice - cold KH250KCl buffer ( 100 mM KOAc , 20 mM Hepes , 250 mM KCl , complete protease inhibitors [ Roche ] , pH 7 . 4 ) containing either 1 mM MgOAc or 1 mM NaN 3 , 5 mM EDTA and 2 mM deoxyglucose ( ATP - depleting ) , and finally resuspended in 100 m l of the respective buffer . After incubating the cells at 4 8 C for 10 min , cytosol was prepared through rapid freeze / thaw and centrifugation at 20 , 000 g for 5 min . The supernatant was fractionated on Superdex 200 HR 10 / 30 ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) at 0 . 25 ml / min run with 20 mM Hepes , 100 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , pH 7 . Samples prepared with KH250KCl and 1 mM MgOAc were incubated with 1 mM Mg 2 1 ATP and a regenerating system for 10 min at 37 8 C before fractionation . Fractions were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and Western blotting . Subcellular Fractionation of Adenovirally Infected Cells . Infected cells were released from 15 - cm dishes with PBS plus 5 mM EDTA . The cells ( 10 7 ) were washed with 100 mM Mes , pH 6 . 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 5 mM MgCl 2 , 250 mM KCl , 250 mM sucrose and complete protease inhibitors , resuspended in 200 m l of the same buffer , and disrupted by freeze – thaw . Rigorous mixing via a Vortex and drawing the suspension through a 22 - gauge needle released coated vesicles from larger membranes . Subse - quent centrifugation at 14 , 000 g pelleted the heavy membranes including the PM , Golgi , and endosomal compartments . The low speed supernatant was centrifuged at 100 , 000 g , generating a high speed pellet containing the vesicular pool and a high speed supernatant corresponding to the cytosolic pool . Alternatively , the low speed supernatant was loaded onto an S - 1000 column ( 1 . 0 3 90 cm ; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) run at 0 . 07 ml / min ( Phan et al . , 1994 ) . 2 - ml fractions were collected , TCA precipitated , and analyzed by SDS - PAGE and Western blotting . Biochemical Assays Clathrin Release Assay . Hsc70 - mediated clathrin release was performed for 8 min at 25 (cid:176) C in 20 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 0 , 25 mM KCl , 2 mM Mg 2 1 / ATP as previously described ( Hannan et al . , 1998 ) .

The steady state distribution of surface - bound TfnR was determined by monitoring the relative amounts of BXX - Tfn that bound to virally infected cells in the absence and pres - ence of saponin . After the infection of 10 5 cells grown in 12 - well plates , the cells were washed twice with ice - cold PBS , 1 mM MgCl 2 , and 1 mM CaCl 2 ( PBS 2 1 ) . For the subsequent 4 8 C washes that follow , the cells in half the wells were permeabilized with PBS 4 1 / 0 . 05 % saponin , and the cells in the remaining wells were left intact and washed with PBS 4 1 . The cells were initially incubated with PBS 4 1 6 saponin for 30 min and subse - quently were incubated with 4 m g / ml BXX - Tfn in PBS 4 1 6 saponin for 2 h . The cells were then washed four times with PBS 4 1 6 saponin and twice with PBS . To determine total cell - associated BXX - Tfn , the cells were lysed in blocking buffer ( 10 mM Tris HCl , pH 7 . 6 , 50 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 1 % SDS , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 0 . 2 % BSA ) , and BXX - Tfn was quantified by ELISA , as described previously ( Damke et al . , 1994 ) . Tfn Receptor Biosynthesis . Trafficking of a pulse of 35 S - labeled TfnR through the Golgi region was monitored by the acquired resistance to en - doglycosidase H ( Endo H ) cleavage and by the addition of complex oli - gosaccharides as described previously ( Omary and Trowbridge , 1981 ; Damke et al . , 1994 ) . Fluid Phase Uptake . HRP was used as a bulk flow marker as described earlier ( Damke et al . , 1994 ) . Internalization of Alexa 488 - Tfn . For immunofluorescence experiments , cells were grown and infected on coverslips . To follow RME , a final con - centration of 50 m g / ml Alexa 488 - Tfn ( Molecular Probes ) was incubated with PBS - washed cells for 5 min at 37 8 C . The coverslips were rinsed with PBS 2 1 and incubated with 100 m g / ml unlabeled Tfn . At designated times , the coverslips were placed at 4 8 C , and at the completion of the time course the coverslips were washed with PBS 2 1 , subjected to a 2 min 37 8 C acidic wash ( Dautry - Varsat et al . , 1983 ) that removed the majority of bound Tfn as indicated by the respective 4 8 C control , and washed again with PBS 2 1 . Cells labeled with Alexa 488 - Tfn , as well as unlabeled cells used for addi - tional labeling studies , were fixed with 3 % formaldehyde and solubilized with PBS 2 1 / 0 . 1 % saponin / 5 % goat serum . Subsequent to fixation and per - meabilization , cells were incubated with primary antibodies as indicated in the figure legends and these were detected with the following secondary antibodies : Texas red – labeled goat anti – rabbit and goat anti – mouse ( Mo - lecular Probes ) and FITC - labeled goat anti – mouse ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . A Zeiss Axiovert 100TV and Spot 32 camera were used to collect digital epi - fluorescent images . Additional immunofluorescence data were collected with a confocal microscope ( MRC 1024 ; Bio - Rad Laboratories ) .

Results Hsc70 ATPase Domain Mutants Are Dominant - interfering In Vitro To identify hsc70 ATPase - deficient mutants that could dominantly interfere with hsc70 function in vivo , we as - sayed three hsc70 mutants in the in vitro clathrin uncoat - ing reaction . The mutated residues ( K71 , D199 , and T204 ) are all found within the nucleotide binding site ( Flaherty et al . , 1991 ) and were originally introduced to understand their contribution to hsc70 ATPase cycling . Hsc70 T204V was formerly characterized within the full - length protein and exhibited normal rates of ATP hydrol - ysis but bound ATP z 100 - fold more weakly than hsc70 WT ( O’Brien and McKay , 1993 ) . Hsc70 D199S and hsc70 K71M were previously characterized within the 44 - kD ATPase fragment and exhibited ATPase rates that were either 50 - fold reduced or undetectable compared with hsc70 WT , re - spectively ( Wilbanks et al . , 1994 ; O’Brien et al . , 1996 ) . Analysis of a 60 - kD fragment containing the ATPase and substrate binding domain suggested that these latter two mutants were also impaired in their ability to yield an ATP - induced conformational change ( Johnson and Mc - Kay , 1999 ) . The ATPase properties of these mutants in the context of full - length hsc70 will be described in detail elsewhere ( Newmyer , S . L . , and S . L . Schmid , manuscript in preparation ) . None of the hsc70 ATPase domain mutants could effi - ciently release clathrin from CCVs , even when present at fivefold higher concentrations compared with the recom - binant wild - type protein ( Fig . 1 A ) . Thus , as has been ob - served in vitro with hsp70 ATPase domain mutants ( Raja - pandi et al . , 1998 ) , proper ATPase cycling was required for hsc70 - mediated CCV uncoating activity . To learn whether the hsc70 mutants could be used in vivo to dis - rupt hsc70 function , the mutant proteins were titrated into the CCV uncoating reaction mediated by native hsc70 , pu - rified from brain cytosol . All three of the mutants inter - fered with the ability of hsc70 Native to mediate clathrin re - lease ( Fig . 1 B ) . Inhibition of the uncoating reaction occurred in a saturable manner with half maximal inhibi - tion occurring at approximately fourfold excess of either hsc70 K71M or hsc70 T204V to hsc70 Native . Hsc70 D199S also in - Figure 1 . Hsc70 ATPase domain mutants inhibit hsc70 - mediated clathrin uncoating . CCVs were incubated in the presence of wild - type and mutant hsc70 proteins .

Thus , these mutants have domi - nant - interfering effects and can be used to probe hsc70 function in the cell . Overexpression of Hsc70 ATPase Mutants in Adenovirally Infected tTA HeLa Cells Hsc70 is abundant , constituting z 1 – 2 % of total cellular protein , and can be detected by Coomassie blue staining of cell lysates ( Fig . 2 A , the identity of each species was con - firmed by Western blotting ) . To generate robust hsc70 ATPase mutant expression , we used a tetracycline - regu - lated adenoviral expression system . The cDNA encoding the wild - type and mutant hsc70 proteins included a se - quence encoding an NH 2 - terminal HA tag in order to dis - tinguish the overexpressed protein from the endogenous protein . Control experiments established that the HA tag did not significantly affect the properties of recombinantly generated hsc70 ( data not shown ) . Reasonable overex - pression ( approximately threefold ) of the mutant protein relative to endogenous hsc70 was attained at high viral lev - els , 400 pfu / cell ( Fig . 2 A ) . Interestingly , some induction of hsp70 , the inducible form of hsc70 , was seen in cells ex - pressing hsc70 K71M and hsc70 T204V . Within these cells , the level of hsp70 equaled that of endogenous hsc70 , suggest - ing that overexpression of inhibitory hsc70 mutants might stress the cell . Under these conditions , however , infected cells exhibited normal morphology as observed by light microscopy and EM analysis ( online supplemental Figure S1 , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / 152 / 3 / 607 / DC1 ) . If higher viral concentrations were used with expression of the mutant proteins , cells would round up and detach . Potential aberrant effects arising from the use of high virus levels were controlled by assaying a sample infected with hsc70 K71M virus in the presence of tetracy - cline to repress expression of the adenovirally introduced gene ( Fig . 2 A ) . Hsc70 ATPase Domain Mutants Dominantly Interfere with Tfn Endocytosis and Recycling Based on in vitro findings , we predicted that the hsc70 mutant – expressing cells would exhibit a CCV uncoating defect provided that hsc70 indeed functions in clathrin uncoating in vivo and that our expression system sup - Figure 2 .

An uncoating defect would limit the cellular sorting of Tfn and prevent its recycling . Accordingly , we assayed a single round of trafficking of surface - bound BXX - Tfn in the virally infected cells . In both control and hsc70 WT - expressing cells , Tfn was en - docytosed rapidly , within 5 min , and the internalized ligand was efficiently recycled ( t 1 / 2 < 15 min ) out to the cell surface ( Fig . 2 B , n and d ) . The mutant - expressing cells demonstrated dramatically different Tfn trafficking kinetics . Consistent with in vitro studies , and supporting a role for hsc70 in CCV uncoating , these cells exhibited significant recycling defects , whereby Tfn remained in the hsc70 mutant expressing cells . 60 min after internal - ization . The recycling defect was most striking with over - expression of hsc70 T204V ( j ) and hsc70 K71M ( m ) with es - sentially all of the internalized Tfn remaining within the cell . Interestingly , the mutant - expressing cells also dem - onstrated endocytosis defects , which in strength were Figure 3 .

Expression of hsc70 D199S , hsc70 T204V , and hsc70 K71M decreased the initial rate of Tfn uptake 1 . 4 - , 2 . 7 - and 10 - fold , respectively , relative to control and wild type – expressing conditions . The data described above were generated by quenching external BXX - Tfn with avidin , a relatively large probe that masks the biotin molecule at early stages of endocyto - sis but cannot access BXX - Tfn when it becomes seques - tered into constricted coated pits ( Schmid , 1997 ) . We also monitored late stages of endocytosis with BSS - Tfn where the disulfide linkage between the biotin and ligand can be cleaved by smaller probes that reduce this bond . Com - pared with BXX - Tfn uptake , similar results were obtained when endocytosis was measured using BSS - Tfn as ligand , and the uptake into sealed CCVs was assessed by resis - tance to the small membrane impermeant reducing agent , MesNa ( data not shown ) . This suggested that endocytic CCV formation was inhibited in the mutant - expressing cells before the formation of constricted coated pits . Thus , these dominant - interfering hsc70 mutants appeared to in - hibit at least two stages of the CCV cycle , initial coated pit formation and a postbudding step . Specificity of Inhibitory Effects of Dominant - interfering Hsc70 Mutants Given the many possible functions of hsc70 within the cell , overexpression of dominant - interfering hsc70 mutants might have a global effect on cell viability . Therefore , to learn whether the inhibitory effects of hsc70 ATPase do - main mutants on endocytosis and recycling were specific , we determined the effects of overexpression of hsc70 WT or hsc70 K71M , the most potent mutant , on vesicular trafficking along the secretory pathway . Cells were pulse labeled with [ 35 S ] methionine , and the delivery of newly synthesized TfnR from the ER to cis - and trans - Golgi compartments was monitored by acquisition of Endo H resistance and the addition of complex oligosaccharides , respectively . Quantitation of the results shown in Fig . 3 A reveal that Endo H – resistant ( Fig . 3 B ) and mature ( Fig . 3 C ) forms of TfnR appeared at similar rates in control and hsc70 WT - expressing cells . The corresponding rates observed in hsc70 K71M - expressing cells were slightly inhibited ( approx - imately twofold ) . The rates of biosynthesis and transloca - tion of TfnR into the ER , as assessed by radiolabel in - corporation and addition of core oligosaccharides , were also not significantly inhibited with overexpression of hsc70 K71M ( data not shown ) . Thus , TfnR biosynthesis was only slightly inhibited by the most potent inhibitor of BXX - Tfn uptake and recycling . To further gauge the specificity of inhibition of RME and recycling by hsc70 mutants , we measured the internal - ization kinetics of the fluid phase marker , HRP . Normaliz - ing to the control condition , cells expressing hsc70 WT , hsc70 D199S , hsc70 T204V , and hsc70 K71M exhibited the follow - ing rates of fluid phase uptake : 0 . 91 6 0 . 14 , 1 . 01 6 0 . 18 , 0 . 72 6 0 . 09 , and 0 . 70 6 0 . 20 arbitrary peroxidase U / mg cel - lular protein / min .

Bulk fluid uptake and trafficking through the Golgi compartments , thus , were both slightly affected in the mutant - expressing cells , suggesting that hsc70 might play a limited role in these processes or that cell viability is slightly compromised by the hsc70 mutants . In contrast to these small effects , overexpression of all hsc70 ATPase mutants significantly inhibited endocytosis and recycling ( Fig . 2 B ) . In the most potent case , endocytosis was inhib - ited 10 - fold , and recycling was no longer detected . Thus , in comparison with other trafficking events , the potent effects of the dominant - interfering hsc70 ATPase mutants appear to be specific for TfnR endocytosis and recycling .

Overexpression of Mutant Hsc70s Sequesters Endogenous Hsc70 in a Complex Given that the hsc70 mutants specifically disrupt Tfn up - take and recycling , we were interested in exploring the mechanism by which the endogenous protein was inhib - ited . We hypothesized that these mutants could inhibit through ( a ) sequestration of clathrin , ( b ) sequestration of auxilin , the DnaJ protein that is thought to target hsc70 to clathrin , and / or ( c ) sequestration of endogenous hsc70 . In vitro , hsc70 forms a stable complex with clathrin and auxi - lin ( Schmid and Rothman , 1985 ; Holstein et al . , 1996 ) ; however , we were unable to detect similar complexes with the hsc70 mutants ( Newmyer , S . L . , and S . L . Schmid , manuscript in preparation ) , suggesting that inhibition is not due to sequestration of either clathrin or auxilin . In contrast , the mutant hsc70s could form dimers and higher order oligomers with hsc70 WT as detected through crosslinking ( data not shown ) . Hsc70 oligomerization is promoted in the presence of ADP , and it has been sug - gested that oligomerization inhibits hsc70 activity ( Ben - aroudj et al . , 1996 ; Gao et al . , 1996 ) . Given that our mu - tants have aberrant ATPase cycles , we looked for their ability to oligomerize with endogenous hsc70 by using size exclusion chromatography to monitor the presence of such complexes in the hsc70 expressing cells ( Fig . 4 ) . In the hsc70 WT - expressing cells ( solid line ) , the endogenous and HA - tagged proteins coeluted just before the BSA stan - dard . Incubation of the lysate with ATP did not alter this elution profile ( data not shown ) , suggesting that under Figure 5 .

Strikingly , in cells overexpressing the K71M mu - tant , endogenous hsc70 coeluted with hsc70 K71M as a higher molecular weight species ( dashed line ) , suggesting that these proteins exist in a complex . We could not deter - mine whether other cytosolic proteins were also present in this complex . As with hsc70 WT cells , the elution profiles observed were unaffected by incubation under ATP - depleting and - supplementing conditions , indicating that the faster migrating hsc70 species is stable to the addition of ATP ( data not shown ) . These results suggested that the overexpression of hsc70 ATPase – deficient mutants cre - ated a new equilibrium between active monomeric and po - tentially inactive oligomeric hsc70 species and that by overexpressing these mutants we have , in effect , seques - tered the endogenous protein . The Unassembled Cytosolic Pool of Clathrin Is Depleted in Cells Overexpressing Dominant - interfering Hsc70 Mutants We next tested whether CCVs indeed accumulate in hsc70 mutant expressing cells as suggested by our observed recy - cling defect . To examine this , we performed subcellular fractionation of control and hsc70 - expressing cells . Lysed cells were fractionated by low and high speed centrifuga - tion to obtain pellets containing heavy membrane ( P1 ) – and vesicular membrane ( P2 ) – associated proteins , respec - tively , and the remaining supernatant was used to identify cytosolic protein ( S ) . In control and hsc70 WT - expressing cells , clathrin was distributed evenly between the heavy membrane and cytosolic pools ( Fig . 5 A ) . Strikingly , in hsc70 K71M - expressing cells , the majority of the cytosolic Figure 6 .

Cells were fixed and processed for fluo - rescence microscopy as de - scribed in Materials and Methods . All images were collected with 2 - s exposures .

Similar results were observed in hsc70 D199S - and hsc70 T204V - expressing cells , with the degree of accumulation of clathrin in the P2 pool being propor - tional to the relative inhibitory strengths of the mutants ( i . e . , K71M . T204V . D199S ; data not shown ) . To fur - ther characterize the vesicular versus cytosolic pools , the low speed supernatant was fractionated by size exclusion chromatography to resolve triskelions from assembled clathrin cages . The majority of clathrin migrated as triskel - ions in control and hsc70 WT - expressing cells but , consistent with our subcellular fractionation findings , migrated like assembled clathrin in the hsc70 K71M - expressing cells ( Fig . 5 B ) . A strong uncoating defect would predict such an in - creased CCV phenotype . Moreover , AP1 and AP2 cofrac - tionated with clathrin in the hsc70 K71M - expressing cells as would be expected if uncoating were inhibited . Recall that hsc70 is required for adaptor protein ( AP ) release from purified CCVs ( Hannan et al . , 1998 ) . We also looked at AP3 , which has been implicated in clathrin - dependent and - independent sorting at the TGN and endosomes ( Simp - son et al . , 1996 ; Dell’Angelica et al . , 1998 ) . In contrast to AP1 and AP2 , we find that AP3 fractionated indepen - dently of the assembled pool of clathrin in hsc70 K71M - Figure 7 . Internalized Tfn is largely associated with punctate AP2 - free structures in mutant hsc70 – expressing cells . Confocal micros - copy was employed to monitor the colocalization of AP2 ( red ) with Alexa 488 - Tfn ( green ) . Hsc70 mutant – expressing cells internalized Alexa 488 - Tfn for 5 min and then were chased for 5 and 20 min . The cells were subsequently fixed and processed .

Relative to control and hsc70 WT - expressing cells , AP3 was not increased in the high speed pellet , and its migration on the S - 1000 column was not altered , consistent with reports that AP3 can func - tion independently of clathrin ( Faundez and Kelly , 2000 ) . Disruption of hsc70 activity , therefore , causes a striking redistribution of clathrin , AP1 , and AP2 to an assembled pool that is consistent with there being a block in un - coating of the corresponding TGN - , endosome - , and PM - derived CCVs . Hsc70 Mutants Inhibit the Transit of TfnR through the Endosomal Compartment Given that the hsc70 ATPase - deficient mutants inhibited CCV uncoating mediated by the wild - type protein in vitro , we expected that overexpression of these mutants might also disrupt CCV disassembly in vivo . We have thus far provided strong evidence that disruption of hsc70 function in vivo alters the steady state distribution of clathrin from the disassembled to assembled states . The potent inhibi - tion of BXX - Tfn recycling would suggest that internalized TfnR might accumulate in newly formed endocytic CCVs . However , when we examined the distribution of TfnR us - ing subcellular fractionation , we were unable to detect an accumulation in the vesicular pool as determined either by differential centrifugation ( Fig . 5 A ) or by chromatogra - phy on S1000 ( data not shown ) . Nor could we detect a TGN - derived cargo molecule , the MPR ( data not shown ) . Therefore , to further elucidate the nature of the recycling defect , we followed the trafficking of a 5 - min pulse of Alexa 488 - Tfn . For these experiments , we studied cells ex - pressing the weaker D199S and T204V hsc70 mutants be - cause they incorporated a significant amount of labeled Tfn within the 5 - min pulse time . In control ( data not shown ) and hsc70 WT - expressing cells , internalized Tfn was initially found in punctate structures resembling vesicles but rapidly trafficked to the perinuclear recycling endo - some and back out of the cell ( Fig . 6 ) . In contrast , the mu - tant cells exhibited prolonged punctate staining that was still detectable 30 min after internalization . To determine whether these punctate structures were endocytic CCVs , the Alexa 488 - Tfn – internalized cells were immunolabeled with anti - AP2 . Normally , the release of coat proteins from CCVs occurs within 1 min of budding , and punctate struc - tures labeling for both coat protein and internalized Tfn are rare . Accordingly , in control ( data not shown ) and Figure 8 . Steady state distri - bution of TfnR and MPR in wild - type and mutant hsc70 – expressing cells . The cellular localization of PM - and TGN - cycled receptors were visual - ized by epifluorescent micros - copy .

Arrows indicate the tu - bular TfnR - labeled structures observed in hsc70 K71M - express - ing cells .

In contrast , AP2 and Tfn colocalization within punctate structures could be detected even 20 min after internaliza - tion in the D199S - and T204V hsc70 – expressing cells , sug - gesting that the uncoating reaction was significantly inhib - ited ( Fig . 7 ) . Similar results were obtained with clathrin labeling and after necessarily longer times of Alexa 488 - Tfn uptake ( 30 min ) into cells expressing hsc70 K71M ( data not shown ) . Surprisingly , in the mutant - expressing cells , only a few costained punctate structures were found even at 5 min after internalization , demonstrating that CCV uncoat - ing is not potently inhibited in these cells . Nonetheless , finding that the majority of Alexa 488 - Tfn – labeled struc - tures did not costain for AP2 was consistent with the frac - tionation experiment , demonstrating that assembled AP2 – clathrin structures accumulated independently of TfnR . Together these data suggest that the accumulating coated structures might represent empty cages . In hsc70 mutant – expressing cells , recycling of internal - ized BXX - Tfn was blocked ( Fig . 2 B ) ; yet , immunolabel - ing studies demonstrated that CCV uncoating was only partially inhibited . These data suggest that other postun - coating trafficking events were also inhibited by the hsc70 mutants . Analysis of trafficking of Alexa 488 - Tfn through endosomal compartments confirmed this suggestion . In control and hsc70 WT - expressing cells , Tfn strongly labels the perinuclear recycling endosome within the initial 5 - min uptake period ( Fig . 6 , 0 chase ) . In contrast , there was considerably less accumulation of Alexa 488 - Tfn in the recy - cling endosome in mutant hsc70 cells , and accumulation appeared to be delayed 5 – 10 min relative to hsc70 wt cells ( Fig . 6 ) . The fluorescence data also demonstrated that punctate staining was substantially lost after 20 min of chase ; yet , hsc70 mutant – expressing cells accumulate BXX - Tfn so that , after 60 min of incubation , the majority of internalized molecules remain in the cell ( Fig . 2 B ) . Col - lectively , our findings indicate that , 20 min after internal - ization , Tfn is localized diffusely throughout the cell and suggest that vesicular trafficking to the cell surface is also inhibited . Thus , the recycling defect found in hsc70 mu - tant – expressing cells is apparently due to inhibition of multiple vesicular trafficking or sorting steps within the endosomal compartment . Hsc70 ATPase Mutants Cause a Redistribution of TfnR within the Cell The overexpression of hsc70 ATPase mutants significantly inhibited the trafficking of Tfn , suggesting that the traf - ficking of the receptor was also inhibited . Therefore , we monitored the steady state distribution of TfnR by immu - nofluorescence to learn how its trafficking was affected by the altered endocytic and recycling kinetics observed for the hsc70 mutant – expressing cells . Accumulation of TfnR within the recycling compartment was decreased , corre - sponding to the increased inhibitory potency of the hsc70 mutant ( Fig . 8 ) . This was especially evident in cells ex - pressing hsc70 K71M where TfnR appeared to accumulate in vesicular and tubular structures ( arrows ) . We also characterized the localization of MPR , which is transported by CCVs between the TGN and late endo - some , and found that this receptor was also more diffusely localized in punctate structures in hsc70 mutant – express - ing cells ( Fig . 8 ) . Consistent with results presented above , neither TfnR nor MPR showed significant colocalization with clathrin in the hsc70 mutant cells ( data not shown ) . The finding that multiple receptors were mislocalized in hsc70 mutant – expressing cells further supports our hy - pothesis that these hsc70 inhibitory mutants interfere with sorting and trafficking within the endosomal compart - ment . Given that TfnR trafficking was decreased with overex - pression of hsc70 mutants , we asked whether the endocy - tosis defect ( Fig . 2 B ) was indirectly due to a decreased number of receptors at the cell surface . To determine the steady state extracellular distribution of TfnR , we mea - sured and compared the binding of BXX - Tfn to virally in - fected cells in the presence and absence of saponin . The percentage of extracellular TfnR was found to be as fol - lows : 16 . 6 6 7 . 8 for control , 18 . 1 6 6 . 5 for hsc70 WT , 17 . 0 6 7 . 5 for hsc70 D199S , 18 . 8 6 5 . 9 for hsc70 T204V , and 37 . 6 6 15 . 3 for hsc70 K71M cells ( n 5 3 or 4 ) , indicating that TfnR was actually increased at the cell surface of hsc70 K71M - express - ing cells . A similar doubling of receptors at the cell surface is observed when RME is inhibited by dynamin mutants ( Damke et al . , 1994 ) . The dramatic changes in the steady state distribution of PM and TGN receptors observed in hsc70 K71M - expressing cells suggests that hsc70 plays multi - ple roles in vesicle trafficking and RME . Discussion Hsc70 and the CCV Cycle We have characterized several hsc70 ATPase – deficient mutants and found them to dominantly interfere with the CCV cycle in vivo . Within HeLa cells , clathrin is equally distributed between assembled and unassembled pools . Overexpresssion of hsc70 mutants dramatically shifts this equilibrium towards the assembled state , demonstrating that hsc70 plays a role in clathrin dynamics . We observed a significant shift of clathrin and AP1 – AP2 complexes into fractions coeluting by size exclusion chromatography with CCVs . We also found prolonged colocalization of AP2 and internalized Tfn in punctate structures , suggesting that the increased assembled pool of clathrin and APs is in part due to a CCV uncoating defect . Hsc70 was previously im - plicated in releasing clathrin from CCVs based on in vitro studies ( Rothman and Schmid , 1986 ) . The physiological significance of hsc70 - mediated uncoating was supported by microinjection studies ( Honing et al . , 1994 ) and by the discovery of a requirement for auxilin , a DnaJ - like protein associated with neuronal CCVs in recruiting hsc70 to as - sembled clathrin for uncoating ( Ungewickell et al . , 1995 ) . Recently , nonneuronal ( GAK ) and yeast ( swa2p / aux1p ) homologues of auxilin have been identified ( Gall et al . , 2000 ; Greener et al . , 2000 ; Pishvaee et al . , 2000 ; Umeda et al . , 2000 ) . Deletion of swa2p / aux1p in yeast results in traf - ficking phenotypes similar to that observed in clathrin - deleted strains , as well as accumulation of coated vesicles ( Gall et al . , 2000 ; Pishvaee et al . , 2000 ) . The in vivo effects of interference with hsc70 function reported here are com - plementary to results from yeast and , together , they estab - lish that CCV uncoating is a general cellular function of hsc70 ( Fig . 9 , step 1 ) . on J u l y 8 , 2017 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 152 , 2001 618 Under normal conditions , endocytic CCVs are rapidly uncoated ( t 1 / 2 < 1 – 2 min ) and their contents are delivered , through fusion , to early endosomes ( t 1 / 2 < 3 min ) ( Mukher - jee et al . , 1997 ) . Overexpression of hsc70 mutants ap - peared to delay the uncoating reaction and prolong the life - time of endocytic coated vesicles ; however , even at early time points , only a relatively small population of in - ternalized Tfn colocalized with AP2 - or clathrin - labeled structures . We were also unable to detect cargo molecules in the AP2 – AP1 – clathrin - containing small vesicular frac - tion . These results suggest that the uncoating reaction was only partially inhibited , a result not unexpected given that the overexpression levels achieved in vivo ( threefold over endogenous ) were considerably less than those needed to potently inhibit hsc70 - mediated uncoating in vitro ( . 10 - fold over wild type ) . Nonetheless , even at these levels of overexpression , we observed a quantitative redistribution of cellular clathrin from the cytosolic pool to the high speed pelleted fraction . One intriguing possibility that could explain this discrepancy is that the assembled coated structures that accumulate in the mutant cells and are pel - letable at high speed are empty coats or misassembled lat - tices ( Fig . 9 , step 2 ) . This scenario would suggest a role for hsc70 in maintaining clathrin ( and perhaps APs ) in an un - assembled state and / or in regulating clathrin – AP assembly . Clathrin and APs are known to spontaneously assemble in vitro under physiological salt conditions , but how as - sembly is regulated in the cell remains obscure . In vitro studies demonstrate that hsc70 forms a stable complex with clathrin during the uncoating reaction , which deters hsc70 from performing additional rounds of uncoating ( Jiang et al . , 2000 ) . Hsc70 is known to stabilize many disas - sembled or unfolded proteins , including steroid hormone receptors and protein kinases ( Morishima et al . , 2000 ) , and has been implicated in chaperoning newly synthesized clathrin during axonal transport ( Black et al . , 1991 ) . Our studies suggest that hsc70 may also chaperone cytosolic clathrin within the CCV cycle , preventing assembly that is not directed towards the PM or TGN . The hsc70 ATPase mutants cannot bind clathrin stably in vitro and therefore could probably not serve such a chaperone function in vivo . This potential chaperone function would explain how empty cages could accumulate in hsc70 mutant – expressing cells disproportionately to CCVs labeled with Tfn . Inhibition of functional clathrin assembly in hsc70 mu - tant – expressing cells is also indicated by the observed RME defect . We find that early rather than late stages of RME are inhibited by overexpression of hsc70 mutants , implicating a role for the endogenous protein in modulat - ing coated pit growth ( Fig . 9 , step 3 ) . It is likely that the rate of coated pit assembly is decreased in mutant - express - ing cells due to the partial depletion of cytosolic clathrin . Additionally , inhibition of RME may reflect a more direct role for hsc70 in chaperoning clathrin for functional as - sembly at the coated pit . Further work is necessary to es - tablish a direct role for hsc70 in coated vesicle formation . Hsc70 and Endosomal Trafficking Characterization of our hsc70 ATPase domain mutants also reveals a role for this chaperone in TfnR recycling ( Fig . 9 , step 4 ) . Surprisingly , the recycling defect in hsc70 mutant – expressing cells could not be ascribed to a potent block in CCV uncoating alone . Indeed , even the weakest hsc70 mutant , D199S , was potently inhibitory , suggesting that hsc70 is critically involved in other stages of TfnR trafficking through the endocytic pathway . In the most po - tently inhibited hsc70 K71M - expressing cells , the internal - ized BXX - Tfn does not appear to accumulate in the recy - cling endosome , and , at steady state , both MPR and TfnR become more diffusely distributed . Collectively , these data suggest that multiple endosomal trafficking events ( early endosome ﬁ recycling endosome ﬁ PM and early en - dosome ﬁ late endosome ﬁ TGN ) are inhibited when hsc70 function is disrupted in vivo . Clathrin coats are well - char - acterized in mediating vesicle formation at the PM and TGN but have also been implicated in modulating endoso - mal trafficking ( Stoorvogel et al . , 1996 ) . APs have also been associated with endosomally derived CCV formation and may mediate specific endosomal sorting events ( Fut - ter et al . , 1998 ; Sorkina et al . , 1999 ; Meyer et al . , 2000 ) . Hsc70 is likely to function in the uncoating and / or forma - tion of all CCVs regardless of their origin . Consequently , the potent recycling defect observed in hsc70 mutant – Figure 9 . Hsc70 is involved in multiple steps in CCV cy - cling and receptor recycling . Hsc70 releases clathrin from newly budded CCVs ( 1 ) . Our studies suggest that hsc70 may then be required to chaperone cytosolic clathrin triskelions ( 2 ) to allow their functional recruitment to coated pits ( 3 ) . Within the endosomal compartment , hsc70 also promotes receptor recycling ( dashed line , 4 ) . on J u l y 8 , 2017 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m Newmyer and Schmid Hsc70 Mutants Disrupt the CCV Cycle In Vivo 619 expressing cells may , in part , reflect a cumulative CCV un - coating / coated pit assembly defect expected for successive vesicular trafficking events along the endocytic pathway . Perturbation of endosomal trafficking may also arise , in part , from inhibited vesicle motility . Multiple studies sug - gest microtubule - based motility is required for endosomal sorting . Recently , an in vitro assay reconstituting the sort - ing of endosomal ligand from receptor was shown to require microtubules and the motor protein kinesin ( Ba - nanis et al . , 2000 ) . A viable DnaJ - like motif was character - ized within kinesin and was suggested to recruit hsc70 for the dissociation of kinesin from vesicles ( Tsai et al . , 2000 ) . Perhaps the potent recycling defect observed in hsc70 - mutant cells is due to defective kinesin - dependent trans - port of vesicles along microtubules . Our identification of novel hsc70 roles will allow us to begin to elucidate the mechanisms that regulate these events . In regards to the CCV cycle , it will be especially interesting to learn how cy - tosolic clathrin is maintained and what directs clathrin as - sembly to the coated pit .
