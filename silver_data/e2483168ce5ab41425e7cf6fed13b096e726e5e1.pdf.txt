King 1 , 2 & David Baker 1 , 2 , 6 The icosahedron is the largest of the Platonic solids , and icosahedral protein structures are widely used in biological systems for packaging and transport 1 , 2 . There has been considerable interest in repurposing such structures 3 – 5 for applications ranging from targeted delivery to multivalent immunogen presentation . The ability to design proteins that self - assemble into precisely specified , highly ordered icosahedral structures would open the door to a new generation of protein containers with properties custom - tailored to specific applications . Here we describe the computational design of a 25 - nanometre icosahedral nanocage that self - assembles from trimeric protein building blocks . The designed protein was produced in Escherichia coli , and found by electron microscopy to assemble into a homogenous population of icosahedral particles nearly identical to the design model . The particles are stable in 6 . 7 molar guanidine hydrochloride at up to 80 degrees Celsius , and undergo extremely abrupt , but reversible , disassembly between 2 molar and 2 . 25 molar guanidinium thiocyanate . The icosahedron is robust to genetic fusions : one or two copies of green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) can be fused to each of the 60 subunits to create highly fluorescent ‘standard candles’ for use in light microscopy , and a designed protein pentamer can be placed in the centre of each of the 20 pentameric faces to modulate the size of the entrance / exit channels of the cage . Such robust and customizable nanocages should have considerable utility in targeted drug delivery 6 , vaccine design 7 and synthetic biology 8 . Programming protein subunits to self - assemble into well defined complexes is a promising route to the custom design of macromo - lecular machines . Protein assemblies have been engineered using metals 9 , 10 , disulfide bonds 11 – 14 , genetic fusions 12 , 15 – 17 , and ideal helix – helix interactions 11 , 13 , 16 , but these approaches have generally yielded polydisperse or unanticipated products . Recently , symmetric model - ling coupled with computational protein – protein interface design has accurately generated protein assemblies with tetrahedral and octa - hedral symmetry 18 , 19 , but these relatively small ( < 16 nm diameter ) nanocages have limited use for packaging or delivery applications because they have little internal volume . Icosahedral point group symmetry contains two - , three - , and five - fold axes of rotation ( Fig . 1a ) . To generate novel icosahedral protein assemblies , trimeric protein scaffolds of known structure were arranged with icosahedral symmetry ( the three - fold axes of the trimers aligned with the three - fold axes of an icosahedron ) and the two remaining degrees of freedom—the distance r from the icosa - hedron centre to the centre of mass of each trimer , and the angle ω of rotation of each trimer about its axis—were optimized for close packing without steric clashes ( Fig . 1b , c ) . The amino acid sequences at the newly formed interfaces between the trimer building blocks were then optimized using RosettaDesign 20 , 21 , and 17 designs were selected for experimental characterization on the basis of properties of the designed interface , including shape complementarity 22 , predicted binding energy , and the number of buried unsatisfied hydrogen - bond donors and acceptors ( see Methods ) . Genes encoding the designs were assembled from oligonucleotides and cloned into the pET29b + vector for expression in E . coli . Most of the designs were found in the insoluble fraction upon cell lysis ; of the three soluble designs , two ( both based on a KDPG aldolase 23 , 24 ) showed substantial shifts in migration relative to the wild - type scaffold when analysed by native ( non - denaturing ) polyacrylamide gel electro - phoresis ( PAGE ) , suggesting higher - order assembly . We selected the one with fewer mutations , I3 - 01 , for further analysis . Five substitutions ( E26K , E33L , K61M , D187V and R190A ) were made to generate the designed interface between trimers ( Fig . 1d ; the amino acid sequences are provided in the Supplementary Information ) . I3 - 01 was purified using immobilized metal affinity and size exclu - sion chromatography ( SEC ) , yielding a single peak with an apparent molecular weight much larger than that of the wild - type trimeric protein and consistent with the expected elution volume for the 60 - subunit assembly ( Fig . 1e ) . A mutant bearing a leucine - to - arginine substitution predicted to disrupt the designed interface eliminated the high - molecular - weight species and returned the elution volume to that of the wild - type scaffold ( Fig . 1e ) . Dynamic light scattering ( DLS ) measurements of I3 - 01 showed a monodisperse population of particles with a hydrodynamic radius of 14 nm , consistent with the design model ( Fig . 1f ) . No disassembly to the trimeric building block was observed at 80 °C or , remarkably , in 6 . 7 M guanidine hydro - chloride ( GuHCl ) ( Extended Data Fig . 1 ) . This hyperstability is a property of both the trimeric scaffold from which I3 - 01 was derived and of the designed interface : both are completely resistant to GuHCl denaturation . An exceptionally sharp disassociation into the constituent trimers was observed between 2 M and 2 . 25 M guanidinium thiocyanate ( GITC ) : at 2 M the dominant species is the icosahe - dron , while at 2 . 25 M only the trimeric building block is observed ( Fig . 1g , Extended Data Fig . 2 ) . Importantly for cargo packaging applications , the disassociation is fully reversible : the hydrodynamic radius of particles formed by diluting disassembled protein in 3 M GITC down to 1 M GITC is identical to those originally produced in E . coli ( Fig . 1h ) . We investigated the structure of I3 - 01 using cryo - electron micros - copy ( cryo - EM ) . The individual particles in large fields of view were homogenous in size and shape ( Fig . 2a ) , and in class averages from 6 , 461 particles , the three projections along the symmetry axes and the overall icosahedral architecture are clearly discernible ( Fig . 2b , c ) .

To probe the robustness of I3 - 01 to genetic fusion , we fused super - folder GFP ( sfGFP ) 26 to one or both termini of the monomeric subunit and produced the resulting proteins in E . coli . SEC analysis showed that the fusion proteins had hydrodynamic radii consistent with cage formation ( Extended Data Fig . 3 ) .

Class averages of 13 , 297 particles revealed con - siderable internal density compared to the original I3 - 01 averages , consistent with computational models of the fusion complex ( Fig . 3a ) . The I3 - 01 sfGFP fusions are robust to denaturation of the amino ( N ) - or C - terminal fused sfGFP in GuHCl ; the particles remain assembled as GFP signal is lost 27 ( Extended Data Fig . 4 ) . It is at present challenging to infer subunit copy number in GFP - tagged assemblies from their fluorescence intensity . What is needed are ‘standard candles’ with known fluorescent protein copy num - bers that can be used to correlate fluorescence intensity to copy number . To complement the icosahedra with 60 and 120 copies of sfGFP described above , we fused sfGFP to one or both components of a previously described two - component tetrahedron ( T33 - 21 ; ref . 19 ) to generate assemblies with 12 or 24 copies of sfGFP ( Extended Data Fig . 3 ) . Intensity histograms obtained for each of the sfGFP - nanocage constructs using widefield fluorescence microscopy were well fitted with Gaussians ( Fig . 3b , c ) , and the mean fluorescence intensity for each cage was found to be linearly proportional ( r 2 = 0 . 9925 ) to sfGFP copy number ( Fig . 3d ) . The fluorescent properties of the particles were readily manipulated by substituting sfGFP with mTur - qoise2 and sYFP2 ( Extended Data Fig . 5 ) . In addition to serving as genetically encoded , water - soluble fluorescent standard candles , the fluorescent protein cage fusions could be useful for correlative light and electron microscopy 28 since the icosahedral shape is quite distinctive . In I3 - 01 , the trimeric building blocks are aligned with the three - fold axes while the designed interface is along the icosahedral two - folds . To explore the possibility of symmetry - matched fusions to designed nanocages , we modelled a designed pentameric helical bundle 29 into the centre of the large 9 - nm pore at the five - fold axis with a C - terminal linker ; this fusion was named I3 - 01 ( HB ) . Negative - stain electron microscopy showed monodisperse particles of the expected size and symmetry ; the incorporation of the pentamer does not interfere with icosahedron assembly . Particle averages showed a structure similar to that of the original icosahedron , with additional density at the centre of each five - fold axis , consistent with computational models of the fusion protein ( Fig . 3e , f ) . The capability of incorporating symmetry - matched substructures into designed nanocages offers considerable flexibil - ity and modularity ; for example , pentamers filling otherwise open pentameric faces could control the release of cargo contained within the nanocage . The designed I3 - 01 icosahedron is exceptionally stable , robust to genetic fusion , and has a considerably larger internal volume than previously designed nanocages with well defined and prespecified structures 14 , 17 , 19 . Enzymatic activity is retained in the assembled ico - sahedron ( Extended Data Fig . 6 ) , suggesting a route to custom nano - reactors . The ability to accurately design icosahedral protein structures opens the door to new approaches to vaccine generation and targeted drug delivery .

Crystal structures of 300 trimers with resolution better than 2 . 5 Å and lacking long loops were selected from the Protein Data Bank ( PDB ) to use as building blocks . For each scaffold , 20 trimeric building blocks were arranged in icosahedral symmetry by aligning the three - fold rota - tional axis of each trimer with one of the three - fold icosahedral symmetry axes . While preserving symmetry , the building blocks were then docked together by enumeratively sampling their rotations ( ω ) about the three - fold symmetry axes and translating ( r ) them into contact along the aligned axes . Configurations in which backbone atoms from different building blocks were less than 3 . 5 Å apart were discarded . Non - clashing design models were ranked based on the number of pairs of β - carbons in adjacent subunits within 12 Å and further sampling was carried out around the top 208 docked configurations on a 0 . 5 Å by 0 . 2 Å grid . Symmetric RosettaDesign 20 , 21 calculations were then used to generate low - energy , symmetric hydrophobic interfaces , and the resulting designs were filtered based on shape complementarity 22 ( sc ) , interface surface area ( sasa ) , buried unsatisfied hydrogen bonds ( uhb ) , and binding energy ( ddg ) . Designed substitutions that did not substantially contribute to the interface were reverted to their original identities . All Rosetta scripts used are available upon request ; the full 60 - subunit design model of I3 - 01 is provided in the Supplementary Information . Cloning , screening , and protein purification . Codon - optimized genes encod - ing the wild - type and the designed molecules were generated by recursive poly - merase chain reaction ( PCR ) from sets of synthetic oligonucleotides ( Integrated DNA Technologies ) . Five mutations were incorporated into I3 - 01 : E26K , E33L , K61M , D187V and R190A . All genes were cloned into the pET29b + plasmid with kanamycin resistance and expressed in BL21 Star ( DE3 ) E . coli cells ( Invitrogen ) induced with isopropyl β - d - 1 - thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) for 4 h at 37 °C . Cell lysis was accomplished in Tris - buffered saline ( TBS ; 50 mM Tris , 500 mM NaCl ) with lysozyme ( 0 . 25 mg ml − 1 ) and sonication ( Fisher Scientific ) at 20 W for 5 min total ‘on’ time , using cycles of 10 s on , 10 s off . For initial screening , all constructs were labelled with the CoA - 488 fluorophore ( NEB ) by the addition of AcpS 30 ( NEB ) using an A1 peptide tag , allowing the solubility and assembly state of each design to be analysed using SDS – PAGE and native - PAGE ( Bio - Rad ) , following procedures previously described 18 . All subse - quent experiments were performed on either ( His ) 6 - tagged protein or remained untagged . After lysis and centrifugation at 20 , 000 g for 30 min , the soluble fraction of ( His ) 6 - tagged proteins were passed through 2 ml of nickel nitrilotriacetic acid aga - rose ( Ni - NTA ) ( Qiagen ) , washed with 30 mM imidazole , and eluted with 500 mM imidazole . Pure proteins were collected after elution from a Superose 6 10 / 300 GL SEC column ( GE Healthcare ) at 9 – 11 ml , depending on the fusion variant . For non - ( His ) 6 - tagged proteins , cells were lysed as above , and the cleared lysates were treated with serial ammonium sulfate precipitation treatments ( 20 % , 60 % w / v ) . During each step , solid ammonium sulfate was added to the lysate to the desired percentage , and equilibrated at room temperature for 1 h . Ammonium sulfate precipitated protein was then collected by centrifugation at 20 , 000 g for 30 min at 25 °C . After treatment at 60 % , the pellet was then solubilized in TBS and heated at 80 °C for 10 min . The soluble fraction was then collected and further purified through SEC as described . KDPG enzyme assay . The reaction was carried out in 25 mM HEPES , 20 mM NaCl buffer at pH 7 . 0 with the presence of NADH ( 0 . 1 mM ) , L - lactate dehydro - genase ( LDH , 0 . 11 U μ l − 1 ) , and 2 - keto - 3 - deoxy - 6 - phosphogluconate ( KDPG , 1 mM ) at 25 °C , based on previously described methods 23 . Native 1wa3 , I3 - 01 , or I3 - 01 ( K129A ) was added at 0 . 02 μ M final concentration to each well and immediately monitored for 339 nm ultraviolet absorbance over time . Dynamic light scattering . Purified protein was measured using a DynaPro NanoStar ( Wyatt ) DLS setup . 0 . 5 mg ml − 1 of I3 - 01 and 1wa3 were measured at 25 °C , then the temperature was ramped up to 90 °C , then ramped back down to 25 °C for temperature scans at 2 °C min − 1 . Measurements were taken in the pres - ence of TBS : 25 mM Tris , 500 mM NaCl ; buffered GuHCl : 25 mM Tris , 500 mM NaCl , 1 – 6 . 7 M GuHCl ; or buffered GITC : 25 mM Tris , 500 mM NaCl , 1 – 4 M GITC . Different concentrations of GITC equilibrated samples were achieved by combin - ing stocks of 0 M and 4 M equilibrated solutions in different ratios while GuHCl equilibrated samples were equilibrated individually . Each sample was allowed to equilibrate in their respective buffer for at least 24 h before measurement . Re - annealing experiments were performed by diluting I3 - 01 equilibrated in 3 M GITC down to 1 M GITC final concentration ( 0 . 166 mg ml − 1 protein ) . Data analy - sis was performed using DYNAMICS v7 ( Wyatt ) , reporting regularization fits ( with D10 / D50 / D90 ) except for temperature ramp experiments , where cumulant fits were used . The ~ 1 nm radius particle consistent with GITC buffer alone was dis - regarded for analysis , and monodispersity was assumed when peak polydispersity was below 15 % ( refs 31 and 32 ) . Negative - stain electron microscopy . 3 μ l of purified I3 - 01 and I3 - 01 ( ctGFP ) at 0 . 1 mg ml − 1 were applied to glow discharged , carbon - coated 200 - mesh copper grids ( Ted Pella ) , washed with Milli - Q water and stained with 0 . 75 % uranyl for - mate as described previously 33 . Grids were visualized for assembly validation and stability and subsequently optimized for cryo - EM data collection . Screening was performed on a 120 kV Tecnai Spirit T12 transmission electron microscope ( FEI ) with a bottom - mount TVIPS F416 CMOS 4k camera . 6 μ l of purified I3 - 01 and I3 - 01 ( HB ) at 0 . 05 – 0 . 1 mg ml − 1 were applied to glow discharged , carbon - coated 400 - mesh copper grids ( Ted Pella ) , washed with Milli - Q water and stained with 0 . 75 % uranyl formate . Grids were visualized for assembly validation and optimized for data collection . Screening and sample optimization was performed on a 100 kV Morgagni M268 transmission electron microscope ( FEI ) equipped with an Orius charge - coupled device ( CCD ) camera ( Gatan ) . Data collection was performed on a 120 kV Tecnai G2 Spirit transmission electron microscope ( FEI ) . All final images were recorded using an Ultrascan 4000 4 k × 4 k CCD camera ( Gatan ) at 52 , 000 × magnification at the specimen level . Coordinates for 6 , 576 I3 - 01 and 4 , 131 I3 - 01 ( HB ) unique particles were obtained for aver - aging using EMAN2 34 . Boxed particles were used to obtain two - dimensional class averages by refinement in EMAN2 . Additional image analysis was performed using ImageJ 35 . Cryo - EM . 5 μ l of purified untagged I3 - 01 and I3 - 01 ( ctGFP ) , diluted to ~ 0 . 1 mg ml − 1 using TBS buffer ( 25 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 150 mM NaCl ) with an addi - tional 2 mM dithiothreitol were applied to glow discharged 1 . 2 / 1 . 3 Quantifoil grids , blotted and plunged into liquid ethane using a Vitrobot ( FEI ) . Screening and grid optimization was performed on a 200 kV TF20 transmission electron microscope ( FEI ) with a bottom - mount TVIPS F416 CMOS 4k camera . 4 – 6 s movies were recorded on a 300 kV Titan Krios ( FEI ) using a Gatan K2 direct detector at either 29 , 000 × or 37 , 000 × magnification at the specimen level at ~ 10 electrons per pixel per second . Movies were motion - corrected using previously described methods 36 . Coordinates for 6 , 461 ( I3 - 01 ) and 13 , 297 ( I3 - 01 ( ctGFP ) ) unique particles were obtained for averaging using EMAN2 34 . Extracted frames of these particles were used to calculate class averages by refinement in IMAGIC 37 using mul - tiple rounds of multivariate statistical analysis and multi - reference alignment . An initial density model was calculated based on the calculated averages using EMAN2 34 and the fitting of the model and correlation were calculated using UCSF Chimera 38 . Low - resolution ( 17 – 30 Å ) volumes from the I3 - 01 design model were calculated using SPIDER 39 and inspected in UCSF Chimera 38 . Back - projection images were computed in SPIDER 39 on the low - resolution volumes and visualized using WEB 39 . The contrast of all micrographs was enhanced in Fiji 40 . Symmetrical linker modelling . RosettaRemodel 41 was used to model I3 - 01 ( ctGFP ) and to generate linkers for I3 - 01 ( HB ) . For I3 - 01 ( ctGFP ) , I3 - 01 was held static while the linker was sampled via fragment insertion , placing the sfGFP molecules at the end of the linker . The overall model was sampled symmetrically with icosahedral symmetry . For I3 - 01 ( HB ) , I3 - 01 was held static while linkers of different lengths ( 7 – 12 residues ) were sampled via fragment insertion . The resulting placement of the helical bundle at the end of the linker was filtered with pentameric assembly constraints to determine linker lengths that could satisfy formation of the pen - tameric helical bundle . The shorter linkers that allowed unstrained helical assem - bly were selected for experimental testing . Example scripts are supplied in the Supplementary Information . Fluorescence microscopy . Different constructs used for fluorescence micros - copy were generated by genetically fusing sfGFP to the termini of nanocages . For T33 - 21 , the sfGFP was fused to either the C terminus of the first component ( 12 sfGFP molecules ) , or the C terminus of both components ( 24 sfGFP molecules ) . For I3 - 01 , the sfGFP was fused to either terminus of I3 - 01 ( 60 sfGFP molecules ) , or both termini of I3 - 01 ( 120 sfGFP molecules ) . For mTurquoise2 and SYFP2 versions , sfGFP was replaced with the sequence of the respective fluorescent pro - tein bearing additional surface mutations identical to sfGFP 26 . GFP nanocages were mounted on agarose pads for microscopy as previously described 42 . Images of the GFP nanocages were obtained using a DeltaVision system ( Applied Precision ) with an IX70 inverted microscope ( Olympus ) , a U Plan Apo 100 × objective ( 1 . 35 NA ) and a CoolSnap HQ digital camera ( Photometrics ) . GFP images were taken with a 0 . 4 s exposure , in a single focal plane , and binned 1 × 1 . The fluorescence intensities of GFP puncta were identified and quantified using custom Matlab programs as previously described 43 ; programs are available upon request . Fluorescent intensity histograms of individual sfGFP - fused cages were fitted with Gaussian distributions , shown with mean total arbitrary fluorescence unit ( AFU ) intensity ± one standard deviation . © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited .
