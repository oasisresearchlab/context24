For the reporter assay , we designed 50 constructs , each with a single hairpin based on the binding sites of the RNA - binding coat proteins of phages MS2 , PP7 , GA , and Q β , at various positions within the N - terminus of a reporter gene . In the absence of RNA - binding proteins , the translation level depends on the position of the hairpin , and exhibits three - nucleotide periodicity . For hairpin positions within the initiation region , in the presence of cognate RNA - binding protein , we observe strong translational repression . In vivo SHAPE - seq results for a representative construct indicate that repression correlates with protection of both the hairpin and the ribosome binding site . Our data suggest that the RBP - hairpin complex entraps the 30S subunit , thereby stalling initiation . We utilize the repression phenomenon in a high - throughput assay for quantitative study of protein - RNA binding in vivo .

It is a process thought to be mediated largely by proteins , which interact with either chromatin or its RNA product . The best - known form of regulation is mediated by transcription factors , which control RNA levels by their sequence - specific interaction with DNA . Gene expression regulation based on protein - RNA interactions , however , is quite different , due to the nature of RNA . Unlike DNA which is a long , chromatinized , replicated , and for the most part exists as a double stranded molecule , RNA is a short , transient ( i . e . constantly manufactured and degraded ) , exists in multiple copies , has particular modifications 1 , 2 , and folds into functional secondary and tertiary structures . RNA structure is thought to be highly dynamic , and is dependent on many factors such as temperature , cellular RNA - binding protein ( RBP ) content , presence or absence of translating ribosomes , and interaction with other RNA molecules 3 . Thus , a typical RBP - RNA interaction is likely to depend not only on the presence of a specific binding sequence , but also on many other factors . In bacteria , post - transcriptional regulation has been studied extensively in recent decades . There are well - documented examples of RBPs that either inhibit or directly compete with ribosome binding via a variety of mechanisms . These include direct competition with the 30S ribosomal subunit for binding via single stranded recognition 4 , entrapment of the 30S subunit in an inactive complex via a nested pseudoknot structure 5 , and ribosome assembly inhibition when the RBP is bound to a structured RBP binding site , or hairpin 6 – 9 . These hairpins have been studied in three distinct positions : either immediately downstream and including the AUG 7 , upstream of the Shine - Dalgarno sequence 8 , or as structures that entrap Shine - Dalgarno motifs , as for the PP7 and MS2 phage coat - protein binding sites . There is also a well - characterized example of translation stimulation : binding of the phage Com RBP was shown to destabilize a sequestered ribosome binding site ( RBS ) of the Mu phage mom gene , thereby facilitating translation 10 , 11 . While these studies indicate a richness of RBP - RNA - based regulatory mechanisms , a systematic understanding of the relationship between RBP binding , sequence specificity , the underlying secondary and tertiary RNA structure , and the resultant regulatory output is still lacking . In recent years , advances in next generation sequencing technology combined with selective nucleic acid labeling approaches have facilitated focused study of specific RNA structures in vivo . These chemical - modification approaches 12 – 16 can generate a “footprint” of the dynamical structure of a chosen mRNA molecule in vivo , while in complex with ribosomes and / or other RBPs .

While these synthetic approaches have been mostly applied to transcriptional regulatory platforms 17 – 20 , their potential for deciphering post - transcriptional regulatory mechanisms have been demonstrated in a recent study that interrogated IRES sequences in mammalian cells 21 . Building on these advances and on a smaller - scale demonstration of translational repression by the RBP L7Ae in both bacteria and mammalian cells 22 , we measured the regulatory output of a small library of synthetic constructs in which we systematically varied the position and type of RBP binding sites . In addition , we selectively applied SHAPE - seq 23 , 24 , 15 to a single variant , to further identify and characterize RBP - based regulatory mechanisms in bacteria . Our findings indicate that the chosen structure - binding RBPs - coat proteins from the bacteriophages GA 25 , MS2 26 , PP7 9 , and Q β 27 - generate a strong repression response when bound in the translation initiation region . We employed this repression phenomenon as an in vivo binding assay for RBP - RNA interactions . Using this assay , we can quantitatively characterize RBP binding to a set of mutated binding sites in a high - throughput fashion , thereby increasing our understanding of RBP - RNA binding in vivo , and enabling the engineering of more complex RNA - based applications . Results Hairpins inside the coding region do not inhibit translation We first studied the translational regulatory effects of hairpins located within the 5’ end of a transcribed gene . We chose to work with RBP binding - site sequences encoding hairpin structure ( Fig . 1a , all structures herein were generated using NUPACK 28 ) , in the absence of their cognate RBPs [ the phage coat proteins of bacteriophages GA ( GCP ) , MS2 ( MCP ) , PP7 ( PCP ) , and Q β ( QCP ) ] . The four wild - type binding sites are characterized by two stems of varying length , which are separated by a single unpaired nucleotide or " bulge” , and a loop of differing size that varies from 3 to 6 nucleotides . We measured the effect of hairpin position using a reporter system comprising a plasmid with a fluorescent mCherry gene under a constitutive pLac / Ara promoter ( Fig . 1b - top right ) , with a single binding site inserted into the mCherry coding region ( additional nucleotides were inserted downstream of the binding site to maintain the reading frame ) . Hairpin distance δ from the first nucleotide of the mCherry AUG was varied from 4 ( immediately adjacent to the AUG ) to 11 nt , at 1 nt resolution ( see Supplementary Table 1 for sequences ) , and from 4 to 21 nt for PP7 - wt .

The data show that mCherry expression depends strongly on the position of the hairpin relative to the AUG , varying between inhibition to strong expression , where the black dashed line corresponds to the expression level for unstructured mRNA , averaged over two variants lacking apparent hairpins at the N - terminus ( see Supplementary Table 1 – one with only the natural mCherry reporter , and another with a codon for Glycine [ GGC ] added after the AUG ) . In particular , constructs containing the Q β - wt and GA - wt hairpins exhibit approximately a two - order - of - magnitude jump in expression when δ is shifted from 8 to 9 , and 7 to 8 , respectively . Interestingly , mCherry expression for all four hairpins exhibited 3 - nt periodicity , indicating that the basal expression levels depend on the position of the hairpin within the reading frame of the translating ribosome . To explore the effect of the in - frame positions ( δ = 4 , 7 , etc . ) , which are inaccessible using the PP7 - wt , MS2 - wt , or Q β - wt sequence ( due to in - frame stop codons ) , we studied both the GA - wt binding site ( out - of - frame stop codon for δ = 6 , 9 , etc . ) and two Q β binding sites for which the stop codon was mutated ( see Supp . Fig . 1 ) . Basal expression levels for both the GA - wt ( green line ) and the mutated Q β binding sites ( Fig . 1b - inset ) show that there is no observed special regulatory role for the in - frame ( δ = 4 , 7 , etc . ) positions . We propose that the ribosome unwinds the hairpin structures at different rates during initiation ( depending on AUG - hairpin distance δ ) , thus providing a plausible explanation for the dependence of expression on the position of the binding site with respect to the start codon of mCherry . Such a position - dependent translation process can be modeled , for example , as a hopping process ( see Supplementary Methods ) . Here ( Fig . 1c - left ) , the transition between two translation steps can occur over one of three time scales . The first , fast time scale ( T fast ) corresponds to the time it takes the ribosome to pull in the next three unpaired nucleotides , and to shift the tRNA one position ( from the P position to E , or from the A position to P ) . The second , slower kinetic process ( T int ) is carried out when the ribosome encounters a structured trinucleotide whose first base is single - stranded ( top schematic left ) . Finally , a slow kinetic process ( T slow ) unfolds when the ribosome encounters a structured trinucleotide whose first base is double - stranded . Recent single - molecule studies 29 showed that the ribosome is capable of forcing open a double - stranded trinucleotide , but the rate at which this happens is significantly slower than a typical fast translation step ( 0 . 2 not peer - reviewed ) is the author / funder .

As a result , the number of “slow” steps ( Fig . 1c - right ) that a ribosome needs to take in order to clear the initiation region determines the initiation rate , and could potentially also dominate the overall translation rate . RBPs repress translation when bound within the ribosomal initiation region of mRNA We next explored the regulatory effect of an RBP - hairpin complex , as a function of hairpin position downstream to the AUG . To do so , we constructed 22 two - plasmid strains ( Fig . 2a ) : the first was a subset of the plasmids that were used for the hairpin experiments in the N - terminus region ( see Fig . 1b - right for schematic and Supplementary Table 1 ) , while the second encoded an RBP fused to mCerulean , under a pRhlR promoter inducible by N - butanoyl - L - homoserine lactone ( C 4 - HSL ) . We used two different RBPs : the phage coat proteins QCP and PCP of bacteriophages Q β and PP7 , respectively ( see Supplementary Table 2 ) . Each RBP—binding - site plasmid pair was transformed into E . coli TOP10 and grown in 24 different C 4 - HSL concentrations , in duplicate . Optical density , mCherry , and mCerulean fluorescence levels were measured at multiple timepoints for each inducer concentration . mCherry production rates 30 , 31 were computed over a 2 - 3 hr window ( see Supplementary Methods and Supp . Fig . 2 ) for each inducer level , and mCerulean levels were averaged over the same time - frame . In Fig . 2b , we plot a series of dose - response curves obtained for PCP on three constructs containing the PP7 - wt binding sites , positioned at δ = 7 ( red ) , 11 ( blue ) , and 16 ( green ) nt , respectively . For the hairpin located at δ = 7 , the mCherry rate of production is reduced by nearly two orders of magnitude . For the hairpin positioned at δ = 11 , a weakly repressing dose - response function was detected , while no repression was observed at δ = 16 . We hypothesized that the RBP - bound hairpin complex interferes with the initiation process , thus preventing the 70S elongating subunit from forming ( see Fig . 2c ) . To test this model , we measured the mCherry rate of production for the PP7 - wt and Q β - wt sites in the presence of PCP and QCP , respectively , for δ varying from 5 to 21 nt . Since the initiation region is thought 32 to extend from the RBS to about 8 - 10 nucleotides downstream of the AUG ( + 11 to + 13 in our coordinates ) , the chosen range of δ covered both the initiation and elongation regions . The data ( Fig . 2d ) show that while strong repression is observed for both RBPs within the initiation region , the RBP inhibition effect completely disappears for δ ≥ 16 , for both binding sites . This stands in contrast to the regulatory effect generated by the PP7 - wt hairpin by itself ( see Fig . 1b ) , which persists within both the ribosomal initiation and elongation regions . not peer - reviewed ) is the author / funder .

Fig . 3 ) using the acylimidazole reagent 2 - methylnicotinic acid imidazolide ( NAI ) , which modifies the 2’ OH of non - or less - structured , accessible RNA nucleotides as found in single - stranded RNA molecules 23 . We focused on the PP7 - wt , δ = 5 construct for which we observed down - regulation in the presence of PCP , and on the 5S rRNA as a previously - characterized control 24 ( Supplementary Fig . 4a - b ) . The protocol was applied both in vivo [ following 24 ] and in vitro [ following 15 ] for the two RNA targets . As previously shown 33 , 34 , RBP - RNA interactions in vivo limit the 2’ - hydroxyl acylation , whereas the chemical probing is uninhibited in vitro , where RBPs are absent . To compare to gene expression results , we carried out SHAPE - seq on the two induction states 0 nM of C 4 - HSL ( i . e no PCP present ) , and 250 nM of C 4 - HSL ( PCP fully induced ) , after ensuring that the RNA levels at both induction states are similar using quantitative PCR ( Fig . 3b – inset ) . In addition , we applied SHAPE - seq to purified and refolded transcripts in vitro . To quantify the propensity of a particular position to be modified in SHAPE - seq , we computed the ratio of the number of counts obtained for the modified sample to the unmodified sample , for each condition . We validated this analysis approach by first comparing the ratio computation to a previously published “reactivity” algorithm 35 for the 5S rRNA samples , and found them to be comparable ( see Supplementary Fig . 4a - b and Supplementary Methods ) . We next examined the read ratio ( Fig . 3a ) and reactivity ( Supplementary Fig . 4c ) for the in vitro PP7 - wt , δ = 5 samples . For both analysis approaches , we observed three peaks of high ratio / reactivity overlapping or adjacent to the binding - site’s encoded region , which can be attributed to the RBS ( 50 - 51 nt ) , the small A - bulge in the structure ( 64 nt ) , and the large 6 - nucleotide loop ( 69 - 74 nt ) of the PCP binding site . The rest of the RNA nucleotides showed varying ratios / reactivities , consistent with a structured RNA molecule in vitro with various single - stranded bases embedded within . In vivo , in the absence of RBP ( i . e . where gene expression is observed ) , we obtained a read ratio signal for PP7 - wt , δ = 5 ( Fig . 3b - red line ) whose baseline was higher than that observed for the in vitro case . Moreover , the signal was characterized by multiple peaks of both high ratio and reactivity ( Supplementary Fig . 4c - red line ) , at positions that were both not peer - reviewed ) is the author / funder .

This signal is consistent with an interpretation whereby a translationally - active RNA molecule is less structured due to ribosome binding , initiation , and elongation , and thus prone to modifications . For the fully - induced in vivo case ( Fig . 3b - blue line , and Supplementary Fig . 4d - red line ) , the ratio signal baseline for PP7 - wt , δ = 5 is reduced to levels comparable to those observed for the in vitro molecule . In addition , the peaks for the RBS ( 50 - 51 nt ) and the one attributed to the large PP7 - wt loop ( 69 - 77 nt ) in vitro are strongly diminished , while the small peak attributed to the A - bulge seems to be partially attenuated ( 64 nt ) . This analysis is consistent with an interpretation of a structured , translationally - inactive RNA molecule , with a protein bound to the large PP7 - wt loop 36 , and another protein ( possibly an inactive 30S subunit ) bound to the RBS and the initiation region ( schematically shown in Fig . 2c ) . This interpretation is further supported by the extended hypo - modified region downstream spanning to the ~ 80 - 90 nt range ( i . e . bound 30S protection spans a wider region than that of the structured binding sites ) , and the recovery of the in vitro ratio and reactivity scores starting at the ~ 91 - 92 nt position . Effective dissociation constant is insensitive to binding - site position Given the strong RBP - induced repression phenomenon observed in the ribosomal initiation region , we wanted to use this effect to further characterize the binding of the RBPs to structured binding sites . To do so , we first constructed a set of mutated binding sites with various structure - modifying and non - structure - modifying mutations [ compare Fig . 4a - red highlighting to the native sites for MCP ( MS2 - wt - top left ) , PCP ( PP7 - wt middle - left ) , and QCP ( Q β - wt bottom - left ) ] . The mutated binding sites for MCP and PCP were taken from 9 and 9 , respectively ( Fig . 4a ) . We then constructed two to four new constructs for each mutated binding site that differed in binding - site position downstream to the AUG . In addition , we constructed a set of control plasmids that lacked a hairpin within the N - terminus of the mCherry reporter gene . Altogether , we constructed 50 reporter plasmids and 5 no hairpin controls . The new constructs , and the ones previously tested ( Figs . 1b and 2d ) , were co - transformed with all four RBP plasmids to yield 220 RBP—binding - site strains . Our goal with this design was to test not only the binding affinity to the native RBP , but also the not peer - reviewed ) is the author / funder . All rights reserved .

We plot the dose - response curves of 175 out of the 220 as a heat - map in Fig . 4b ( strains with basal mCherry rate of production < 50 a . u . / hr were excluded ) . In all cases , the data for both the mCherry rate of production and mean mCerulean levels are normalized by the respective maximal value . The dose response functions are arranged in accordance with fold - regulation of the response , with the most repressive variants positioned at the bottom , and least repressive at the top . The data show that that there is a substantial subset of strains , which exhibit strong repression for at least one position ( ~ 50 variants ) , with the strongest mCherry signal occurring at the lowest mCerulean level . To obtain an estimate for the effective binding affinity for each down - regulating variant , we fitted each dose - response curve that exhibited a typical repression response ( see Supplementary Fig . 2 ) with a Hill - function - based model ( see Supplementary Methods ) , which assumes a simple relationship between the concentration of RBP , the dissociation constant , and the output expression rate . Finally , we normalized the resulting dissociation constant by the maximal mCerulean expression for the matching RBP to facilitate comparison of the results for the different proteins , yielding an effective dissociation constant ( K RBP ) . Typical error in estimation of the effective dissociation constant was 5 - 20 % , and by averaging K RBP of each RBP—binding - site pair over multiple positions ( values of δ ) we obtained estimated errors of ~ 10 % . Ι n Fig . 4c , we plot the averaged K RBP for different RBP—binding - site combinations as a heat - map only for those sites ( Fig . 4a ) for which all four RBPs were tested ( ` ` null " corresponds to an average K RBP computation made on several of the non - binding - site controls ) . The data show that the effective dissociation constants measured for native sites with their cognate RBPs were low and approximately equal , indicating that native sites are optimized for binding ( blue squares ) . Mutated sites which retained binding affinity displayed slightly larger dissociation constants ( blue - purple ) , while the K RBP values of RBP - binding site combinations that did not generate a binding signature were set to the maximum normalized value 1 ( K RBP = 1 , red ) . When examining the data more closely we find that PCP is completely orthogonal to the MCP / QCP / GCP group , with no common binding sites . Conversely , we observed crosstalk between the different members of the MCP / QCP / GCP group , with increased overlap between MCP and GCP , which is consistent with previous studies 25 . not peer - reviewed ) is the author / funder .

However , putative structure - altering ( MS2 - struct – where the lower stem is abolished ) and destabilizing ( Qb - USLSLm – where the GC base - pairs are converted to UA base - pairs in the lower stem ) mutations significantly affected binding . Interestingly , structure - altering mutations , which retain apparent binding site stability ( PP7 - nB and PP7 - USs ) , also seemed to retain a strong binding affinity to the native RBP . Altogether , these results suggest that binding sites positioned within the initiation region can tolerate multiple mutations as long as certain key structural features necessary for binding and hairpin stability ( e . g . loop size ) are conserved . Discussion Synthetic biology approaches have been increasingly used in recent years to map potential regulatory mechanisms of transcriptional and translational regulation , in both mammalian and bacterial cells . In this work we built on the work of 22 to quantitatively study RBP - based regulation in bacteria using a combined synthetic biology and SHAPE - seq approach . Using our library of RNA regulatory variants , we were able to identify and characterize a position - dependent repression of translational initiation and elongation by a hairpin structure , and strong repression of initiation when the hairpin was bound by an RBP . Characterizing these mechanisms required multiple lines of evidence . For the translation repression mechanism , we first noted the intriguing observation of 3 - nt periodicity in reporter fluorescence levels as a function of the position of the structured hairpin within the N - terminus of the reporter gene . Since other studies have suggested that ribosomes can unwind hairpin structures 37 , 38 , we tentatively attribute the observed periodic effect to position - dependent resistance to unwinding of the mRNA hairpin . Interestingly , the regulatory effect of hairpins inside the ribosomal initiation region has been a source of controversy , with some studies 39 , 38 , 40 , 41 , 32 suggesting that such structured regions should be detrimental to expression , while others have shown that hairpins do not seem to affect expression in the absence of an RBP 7 , 42 , 43 or if the stem is shorter than 6 bp . Our structures are characterized by two stems that are separated by a small 1 nt bulge in the middle that reduces structural stability ( e . g . compare PP7 - wt and PP7 - nb in Fig . 4a ) , which may partially account for the differences from previous observations . Our 3 - nt periodicity finding , which persists to at least + 21 from the AUG , suggests that there is still much to be discovered about not peer - reviewed ) is the author / funder .

When a hairpin exhibiting the 3 - nt periodicity signal is located inside the initiation region and its cognate RBP is present at sufficiently high levels , complete repression is observed . However , this repression is sharply attenuated at + 10 - 11 nt from the AUG , and by + 16 no RBP - based repression is observed . This is despite the fact that the underlying 3 - nt periodicity persists , indicating that the hairpin structure is still stable . This observation , combined with the in vivo SHAPE - seq data showing no detectible modification of the loop - region on the induced PP7 - wt δ = 5 variant , support a model 5 , 44 – 47 in which the bound RBP interrupts initiation ( e . g . by preventing binding of one or more of the initiation factors to the small 30S subunit , inhibiting hairpin unwinding , etc . ) leaving the 30S subunit bound and in an inactive state . However , once the 70S subunit is fully assembled , a bound RBP - hairpin complex located outside the initiation region is unable to inhibit elongation . These results are consistent with the observations of 42 , 32 , who both showed that structured stems of 6 bps or longer in the N - terminus can silence expression up to + 11 - 13 from the AUG , but show negligible silencing when positioned further downstream . Thus , both our results and previous observations support a model whereby the 30S subunit protects a region up to + 11 - 13 nucleotides from the AUG , and that a combination of a short hairpin and a bound RBP is able to inhibit the initiation process . Finally , our results open the door for biotechnological applications . We found that GCP , QCP , and PCP are capable of binding mutually - orthogonal binding sites that differ in structure , while MCP is generally more promiscuous . In addition , we characterized the specific in - vivo interaction of each RBP—binding - site pair by an effective K RBP , which we found to be independent of binding site location . Interestingly , the in vivo K RBP measured for some of the binding sites relative to their native site , differ from past in vitro measurements . In particular , PP7 - nB and PP7 - USs exhibited little or no binding in the in vitro setting 9 , while displaying strong binding in our assay . Our work thus establishes a blueprint for an in vivo assay for measuring the dissociation constant of RBPs with respect to their candidate binding sites . This assay can be used to discover additional binding sites for known RBPs , which could be utilized in synthetic biology applications where multiple non - identical or orthogonal binding sites are needed .

Dashed line represents the average basal level for two constructs with a non - structured sequence replacing the binding site downstream of the AUG . Each of the wt binding sites has a stop codon encoded within its sequence [ see ( a ) ] . As a result , every binding site has a set of positions ( δ = 4 , 7 , etc . for MS2 - wt , PP7 - wt , and Q β - wt , and δ = 6 , 9 , etc . for GA - wt ) , for which a stop codon in frame with the upstream AUG prevents proper readout of the structure’s effect on expression .

The former , faster mode arises when a closed structure opens spontaneously , while the slower mode provides a way for the ribosome to read through highly stable RNA structures . The authors were not able to detect single - nucleotide steps of the ribosome , but did observe clear single - codon steps . They found that the translation rate for the double - stranded RNA ( mechanical unwinding mode ) was 0 . 23 a . a . / s , while the translation rate for the single - stranded RNA ( biasing toward open mRNA mode ) was 0 . 44 a . a . / s . Both of these rates are considerably slower than the in vivo translation rate for the ribosome on an unstructured mRNA , estimated to be 10 - 20 a . a . / s . 2 These experimental observations motivated us to model translation of hairpin structure as a set of discrete pair - opening and translation steps . A toy model for hairpin unwinding When a ribosome translates , it normally pulls a single - stranded nucleic acid chain through a tunnel as the tRNA is shifted from the aminoacyl ( ‘A’ ) to the peptidyl ( ‘P’ ) site , and from the peptydyl site to the exit ( ‘E’ ) site , by an as - yet - poorly - understood mechanism . However , when it encounters a hairpin structure , one of two things may happen : either the single - strand / double - strand junction opens up spontaneously , or the ribosome uses a forcing mechanism to directly open the RNA molecule . Since each translation step is three nucleotides long , the force - pulling must unwind three base - pairs . This implies that the typical translation time for a trinucleotide encoding an amino acid depends on its precise structure . We propose the following translation times : T trinucleotide =   T ssRNA fully − unpaired trinucleotide T pos1 − ss partially − structured trinucleotide , 1st base unpaired T pos1 − ds partially − structured trinucleotide , 1st base paired T dsRNA fully − paired trinucleotide , ( 1 ) where k ssRNA = 1 / T ssRNA and k dsRNA = 1 / T dsRNA correspond to the translation rates for fully single - stranded and double - stranded trinucleotides , respectively , and we introduce two intermediate rates k pos1 − ss = 1 / T pos1 − ss and k pos1 − ds = 1 / T pos1 − ds . The rate for translation of the hairpin is then k hairpin ( δ ) = 1 (cid:80) hairpin trinucleotides T trinucleotide = 1 lT ssRNA + mT pos1 − ss + nT pos1 − ds + pT dsRNA = 1 l / k ssRNA + m / k pos1 − ss + n / k pos1 − ds + p / k dsRNA , ( 2 ) where where l ( δ ) , m ( δ ) , n ( δ ) , and p ( δ ) correspond to the number of fully - single - stranded , partially - structured with ﬁrst - position unpaired , partially - structured with ﬁrst - position paired , and fully - double - stranded trinucleotides encoding the hairpin , respectively . We assume a separation of timescales 2 not peer - reviewed ) is the author / funder . All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

We note that a previous experiment 1 studied only the fully single - and double - stranded cases , so this assumption has to be veriﬁed experimentally . We show the various hairpin reading frames cases that correspond to translation rates a function of hairpin position in Fig . 1c . By varying the position of the hairpin relative to the reading frame , diﬀerent values of n are encountered , resulting in diﬀerent mean translation rates : k hairpin ( δ = 4 ) = 1 T pos1 − ds + T dsRNA (cid:39) 1 2 T dsRNA ≡ k slow 2 k hairpin ( δ = 5 ) = 1 T pos1 − ss + T dsRNA ≡ 1 1 / k int + 1 / k slow . ( 3 ) The model assumes that the translation rate of the entire mRNA molecule is dominated by the translation rate of a single hairpin , located not too far from the 5’ end of the transcript in our experiments , and that the number of mechanical - opening steps n determines the translation rate . The eﬀect of the hairpin dominates if k dsRNA (cid:28) k ssRNA , which is consistent with the value for k dsRNA ∼ 0 . 23 a . a . / s quoted for the fully - paired trinucleotide , 1 and a value of k ssRNA ∼ 10 - 20 a . a . / s . 2 We note that the in vitro value of 0 . 44 a . a . / s measured for k ssRNA 1 is much lower than the typical in vivo values . This is not that surprising given the many diﬀerences between the in vivo and in vitro settings . We expect the in vitro estimate of k dsRNA to be more accurate because it should depend mainly on the binding energy of the mRNA structure , which was probed directly in the in vitro experiment by applying force using optical tweezers to open the mRNA . We do not know why the hairpin dominates over other possible RNA structures encoded in the transcript . It may be more stable , or it may dominate because the mRNA structure has more time to form at positions close to the initiation region , unlike regions far from initiation for which elongation and transcription are known to be coupled . 3 An alternative explanation for the position - dependence of the translation rate is that the diﬀer - ent rates are the result of the use of 3 diﬀerent codon sets for the hairpin , that arise as the unchanged hairpin sequence is shifted through the possible reading frames . It is hard to compensate for the change in codon set since the hairpin sequence encodes structure that we wish to preserve . Deter - mining which of these models is correct would require the detailed analysis of many more hairpin sequences , and possibly single - molecule measurements . 1 . 2 Translation in the presence of an RBP - bound hairpin complex in the coding region In order to describe the eﬀects of a hairpin bound by an RNA binding protein , we will make the following assumptions : 1 . If the hairpin is outside of the initiation region , the bound RBP has no regulatory eﬀect and the rate of translation is determined by the structural characteristics of the hairpin as described above . 2 . If the hairpin is within the initiation region ( i . e δ ≤ 10 ) then a bound RBP can abolish translation entirely . The eﬀect of the RBP reduces to preventing the large 50S ribosomal subunit from binding to the 30S subunit , thus inhibiting the formation of the translationally active 70S ribosomal unit . Given these assumptions , we have a two - state model for translation in the initiation region : k p = (cid:40) k hairpin RBP unbound 0 RBP bound , ( 4 ) 3 not peer - reviewed ) is the author / funder .

Note , that a recent paper 2 proposed that fully - formed 70S subunits may also be active in trans - lation by scanning from the 5’ end of the mRNA ( even in the absence of an available RBS ) . This would imply that some residual translation should be always present depending on the percentage of alternate 70S scanning events ( k p > 0 even for RBS - bound case ) , since we showed that RBPs that are bound inside the elongation region cannot inhibit translation . The very large fold - repression observations ( > 10 ) combined with the extremely low expression levels that we observed at full induction indicate that we are not observing such scanning events in our experiments , or , if they do exist , that they contribute negligibly to the total translation process .

Each minigene was ∼ 500 bp long and contained the following parts : Eagl restriction site , ∼ 40 bases of the 5’ end of the Kanamycin ( Kan ) resistance gene , pLac - Ara promoter , ribosome binding site ( RBS ) , and a KpnI restriction site . Minigenes for the experiments in which the hairpin was encoded in the δ > 0 region , also contained 80 bases of the 5’ end of the mCherry gene , and an ApaLI restriction site . In addition , each cassette contained one or two wild - type or mutated RBP binding sites , either upstream or downstream to the RBS ( see Table S1 ) , at varying distances . All binding sites were derived from the wild - type binding sites of the coat proteins of one of the four bacteriophages MS2 , PP7 , Qbeta , and GA . For insertion into the binding - site plasmid backbone , minigene cassettes were double - digested with Eagl - HF and either KpnI or ApaLI ( New England Biolabs [ NEB ] ) . The digested minigenes were then cloned into the binding - site backbone containing the rest of the mCherry gene , terminator , and a Kanamycin resistance gene , by ligation and transformation into E . coli TOP10 cells ( ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc ) . About 10 % of the plasmids were sequence - veriﬁed by Sanger sequencing . Puriﬁed plasmids were stored in 96 - well format , for transformation into E . coli TOP10 cells containing one of ﬁve fusion - RBP plasmids ( see below ) . 2 . 2 Design and construction of fusion - RBP plasmids RBP sequences lacking a stop codon were ampliﬁed via PCR oﬀ either Addgene or custom - ordered templates ( Genescript or IDT , see Table S2 ) .

The resulting fusion - RBP plasmids were transformed into E . coli TOP10 cells . After Sanger sequencing , positive transformants were made chemically - competent and stored at - 80°C in 96 - well format . 2 . 3 Transformation of binding - site plasmids Binding - site plasmids stored in 96 - well format were simultaneously transformed into chemically - competent bacterial cells containing one of the fusion plasmids , also prepared in 96 - well format . After transformation , cells were plated using an 8 - channel pipettor on 8 - lane plates ( Axygen ) containing LB - agar with relevant antibiotics ( Kan and Amp ) . Double transformants were selected , grown overnight , and stored as glycerol stocks at - 80°C in 96 - well plates ( Axygen ) . 2 . 4 Single - clone expression level experiments Dose - response ﬂuorescence experiments were performed using a liquid - handling system ( Tecan Free - dom EVO 100 , MCA 96 - channel ) in combination with a liconic incubator and a TECAN Inﬁnite F200 PRO platereader . Each measurement was carried out in duplicates . Double - transformant strains were grown at 37°C and 250 rpm shaking in 1 . 5 ml LB in 48 - well plates with appropriate antibiotics ( Kan and Amp ) over a period of ∼ 16 hours ( overnight ) . In the morning , the inducer for the rhlR promoter C 4 - HSL ( N - butyryl - L - Homoserine lactone , Cayman Chemical ) was pippetted manually to 4 wells in an inducer plate , and then diluted by the robot into 24 concentrations ranging from 0 to 218 nM . While the inducer dilutions were being prepared , semi - poor medium consisting of 95 % bioassay buﬀer ( for 1 L : 0 . 5 g Tryptone [ Bacto ] , 0 . 3 ml Glycerol , 5 . 8 g NaCl , 50 ml 1M MgSO 4 , 1ml 10xPBS buﬀer pH 7 . 4 , 950 ml DDW ) and 5 % LB was heated in the incubator , in 96 - well plates ( Perkin Elmer ) . The overnight strains were then diluted by the liquid - handling robot by a factor of 100 into 200 µL of pre - heated semi - poor medium , in 96 - well plates suitable for ﬂuorescent measure - ment ( Perkin Elmer ) . The diluted inducer was then transferred by the robot from the inducer plate to the 96 - well plates containing the strains . The plates were shaken at 37°C for 6 hours . Measurement of OD , and mCherry and mCerulean ﬂuorescence were taken via a platereader ( Tecan , F200 ) every 30 minutes . Blank measurements ( growth medium only ) were subtracted from all ﬂuorescence measurements . For each day of experiment ( 16 diﬀerent strains ) , a time interval of logarithmic growth was chosen ( T 0 to T final ) according to the measured growth curves , between the linear growth phase and the stationary ( T 0 is typically the third measured time point ) . Six to eight time points were taken into account , discarding the ﬁrst and last measurements to avoid errors derived from inaccuracy of exponential growth detection . Strains that showed abnormal growth curves or strains where logarithmic growth phase could not be detected , were not taken into account and the experiment was repeated . The average normalized ﬂuorescence of mCerulean , and rate of production of mCherry were calculated for each inducer concentration using the routine developed in [ 5 , Supplementary Infor - mation ] , as follows ( see Supp . Fig . 2 ) : mCerulean average normalized ﬂuorescence : for each inducer concentration , mCerulean measurements were normalized by OD . Normalized measurements were then averaged over the N logarithmic - growth timepoints in the interval [ T 0 , T final ] , yielding : ˆ mCerulean = 1 N Tfinal (cid:88) t = T 0 mCerulean ( t ) OD ( t ) .

Finally , we plotted mCherry rate of production 6 as a function of averaged normalized mCerulean expression , creating dose response curves as a function of RBP - mCerulean ﬂuorescence . Data points with higher than two standard deviations calculated over mCerulean and mCherry ﬂuorescence at all the inducer concentrations of the same strain ) between the two duplicates were not taken into account and plots with 25 % or higher of such points were discarded and the experiment repeated . 10 2 10 3 50 100 150 200 250 PCP + RBS + _ pp7 _ USs _ d5 500 1000 1500 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800 4 time [ hr ] 2 0 inducer [ mM ] 0 . 150 . 2 0 . 25 0 . 050 . 1 OD time [ hr ] 2 0 inducer [ mM ] 0 200 400 600 mCerulean 4 4 time [ hr ] 2 0 inducer [ mM ] 100 150 50 mCherry inducer [ mM ] 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800 inducer [ mM ] 50 100 150 200 250 m C h e rr y p r o d u c t i o n r a t e [ 1 / h r ] m C e r u l e a n fl u o r e s c e n c e 500 1000 1500 500 1000 1500 500 1000 1500 50 100 150 200 250 0 500 1000 1500 2000 500 1000 1500 2000 ( ) ( ) 1 0 Flu t Flu t production rate = − 1 0 t t ODdt ∫ PCP + RBS + _ Qβ _ wt _ d6 PCP + RBS + _ pp7 _ USs _ d5 Fit mCerulean fluorescence mCerulean fluorescence PCP + RBS + _ pp7 _ USs _ d5 10 2 10 - 6 10 0 10 2 10 - 5 10 0 10 2 10 - 5 10 0 10 2 10 - 5 10 0 10 2 10 - 5 10 0 10 2 10 - 5 10 0 10 - 5 10 0 10 - 5 m C h e rr y p r o d u c t i o n r a t e [ 1 / h r ] m C h e rr y p r o d u c t i o n r a t e [ 1 / h r ] PCP + RBS + _ Qβ _ wt _ d6 PCP + RBS + _ Qβ _ wt _ d6 PCP + RBS + _ pp7 _ USs _ d5 10 2 10 2 mCerulean fluorescence mCerulean fluorescence a b c Supplementary Figure 2 : Estimation of K d from ﬂuorescence data .

Such plots represent production of the reporter gene as a function of RBP presence in the cell .

( 6 ) Here , the mCherry mRNA is either bound to the RBP or unbound , with probabilities P bound and P unbound and ribosomal translation rates k bound and k unbound , respectively . The probabilities of the two states are given by : P boound = ( [ x ] / K d ) n 1 + ( [ x ] / K d ) n and P unboound = 1 1 + ( [ x ] / K d ) n , where [ x ] is RBP concentration , K d is an eﬀective dissociation constant , and n is a constant that quantiﬁes RBP cooperativity ; it represents the number of RBPs that need to bind the binding site simultaneously for the regulatory eﬀect to take place . Substituting the probabilities into Eq . 6 gives : mCherry rate of production = ( [ x ] / K d ) n 1 + ( [ x ] / K d ) n k bound + 1 1 + ( [ x ] / K d ) n k unbound . For the case in which we observe a downregulatory eﬀect , we have signiﬁcantly less translation for high [ x ] , which implies that k bound (cid:28) k unbound and that we may neglect the contribution of the bound state to translation . The ﬁnal model used for ﬁtting was : m Cherry rate of production (cid:39) k unbound 1 + ( [ x ] / K d ) n + C , where C is the ﬂuorescence baseline . Only ﬁt results with R 2 > 0 . 6 were taken into account , For those ﬁts , K d error was typicaly in the range of 0 . 5 - 20 % , for a 0 . 67 conﬁdence interval . 3 Quantitative PCR ( qPCR ) 3 . 1 RNA extraction and reverse - transcription Starters of E . coli TOP10 containing the relevant constructs on plasmids were grown in LB medium with appropriate antibiotics overnight ( 16 hr ) . The next morning , the cultures were diluted 1 : 100 into fresh semi - poor medium ( see Section 2 . 4 ) , and grown for ﬁve hours . For each isolation , RNA was extracted from 1 . 8 ml of cell culture using standard protocols . Brieﬂy , cells were lysed using Max Bacterial Enhancement Reagent followed by TRIzol treatment ( both from Life Technologies ) . Phase separation was performed using chloroform . RNA was precipitated from the aqueous phase using isopropanol and ethanol washes , and then resuspended in RNase - free water . RNA quality was assessed by running 500 ng on 1 % agarose gel . After extraction , RNA was subjected to DNAse ( Ambion / Life Technologies ) and then reverse - transcribed using MultiScribe Reverse Transcriptase and random primer mix ( Applied Biosystems / Life Technologies ) .

Three technical replicates were measured for each of the three biological replicates . A C T threshold of 0 . 2 was chosen for all genes . 4 SHAPE - seq 4 . 1 Experimental setup LB medium supplemented with appropriate concentrations of Amp and Kan was inoculated with glycerol stocks of bacterial strains harboring both the binding - site plasmid ( Section 2 . 1 ) and the RBP - fusion plasmid ( see Section 2 . 2 and Table S3 for details of strains , and Supp . Fig . 3 ) , and grown at 37°C for 16 hours while shaking at 250 rpm . Overnight cultures were diluted 1 : 100 into semi - poor medium ( see Section 2 . 4 ) . Each bacterial sample was divided into a non - induced sample and an induced sample in which RBP protein expression was induced with 250 nM C 4 - HSL , as described above . Bacterial cells were grown until OD 600 = 0 . 3 , 3 ml of cells were centrifuged and gently resuspended in 0 . 5 ml semi - poor medium supplemented with a ﬁnal concentration of 30 mM 2 - methylnicotinic acid imidazole ( NAI ) suspended in anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO , Sigma Aldrich ) , 7 or 5 % ( v / v ) DMSO . Cells were incubated for 5 min at 37°C while shaking and subsequently centrifuged at 6500 g for 5 min . TRIzol - based RNA isolation was performed as described above and used for the strain harboring RBS + _ PP7 _ wt _ d4 , while the silica - membrane – based RNA isolation ( RNAeasy Mini Kit , Qiagen ) was used for strains containing RBS + _ PP7 _ USs _ d - 29 and RBS - _ PP7 _ wt _ d - 29 . Samples were divided into the following sub - samples ( Supp . Fig . 3b ) : 1 . induced / modiﬁed ( + C 4 - HSL / + NAI ) , 2 . non - induced / modiﬁed ( - C 4 - HSL / + NAI ) , 3 . induced / non - modiﬁed ( + C 4 - HSL / + DMSO ) 4 . non - induced / non - modiﬁed ( - C 4 - HSL / + DMSO ) . In vitro modiﬁcation was carried out on DMSO - treated samples ( 3 and 4 ) and has been described elsewhere . 8 Brieﬂy , 1500 ng of RNA isolated from cells treated with DMSO were denatured at 95°C for 5 min , transferred to ice for 1 min and incubated in SHAPE - seq reaction buﬀer ( 100 mM HEPES [ pH 7 . 5 ] , 20 mM MgCl 2 , 6 . 6 mM NaCl ) supplemented with 40 U of RiboLock RNAse inhibitor ( Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) for 5 min at 37°C . Subsequently , ﬁnal concentrations of 100 mM NAI or 5 % ( v / v ) DMSO were added to the RNA - SHAPE buﬀer reaction mix and incubated for an additional 5 min at 37°C while shaking . Samples were then transferred to ice to stop the SHAPE - reaction and precipitated by addition of 3 volumes of ice - cold 100 % ethanol , followed by incubation at - 80°C for 15 min and centrifugation at 4°C , 17000 g for 15 min .

( A ) Overnight - grown bac - terial strains harboring both the RBP - binding site plasmid ( PP7 - wt , δ = 5 containing the mCherry reporter ) and the RBP - fusion plasmid ( PCP - mCerulean ) are split into two samples and PCP - mCerulean expression are induced ( using C 4 - HSL ) for one of them . Following protein expression , each bacterial sample is further split and treated with either DMSO ( as the non - modiﬁed control ) or NAI . Subsequently , RNA is isolated and either further chemically probed ( samples 2 + 4 ) or di - rectly used for subsequent steps of SHAPE - seq ( samples 1 + 3 ) . ( B ) Following 2’ hydroxyl acylation and subsequent RNA isolation , RNA samples are reverse - transcribed using a gene - speciﬁc primer that binds in the target transcript . During reverse transcription , reverse transcriptase is stalled one nucleotide before the modiﬁcation . Subsequently , a single - stranded 5’ phosphorylated ( 5’P ) and 3 - carbon spacer ( 3’C ) adapter sequence is ligated to the obtained cDNAs , which serves in the next step as a primer - binding site for the Illumina index primers to prepare double - stranded DNA for Illumina next generation sequencing . 9 not peer - reviewed ) is the author / funder .

In brief , 1000 ng of RNA were converted to cDNA using the reverse transcription primers ( for details of primer and adapter sequences used in this work see Table S4 ) for mCherry ( # 1 ) or 5S rRNA ( # 2 ) that are speciﬁc for either the mCherry transcript ( RBS + _ PP7 _ wt _ d4 , RBS - _ PP7 _ USs _ d - 29 , RBS - _ PP7 _ wt _ d - 29 ) or 5S rRNA transcript ( used as a positive control for SHAPE - seq ) . The RNA was mixed with 0 . 5 µM primer # 1 or # 2 and incubated at 95°C for 2 min followed by an incubation at 65°C for 5 min . The Superscript III reaction mix ( Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ; 1x SSIII First Strand Buﬀer , 5 mM DTT , 0 . 5 mM dNTPs , 200 U Superscript III reverse transcriptase ) was added to the cDNA / primer mix , cooled down to 45°C and subsequently incubated at 52°C for 25 min . Following inactivation of the reverse transcriptase for 5 min at 65°C , the RNA was hydrolyzed ( 0 . 5 M NaOH , 95°C , 5 min ) and neutralized ( 0 . 2 M HCl ) . cDNA was precipitated with 3 volumes of ice - cold 100 % ethanol , incubated at - 80°C for 15 minutes , centrifuged at 4°C for 15 min at 17000 g and resuspended in 22 . 5 µl ultra - pure water . Next , 1 . 7 µM of 5’ phosphorylated ssDNA adapter ( # 3 ) ( see Table S4 ) was ligated to the cDNA using a CircLigase ( Epicentre ) reaction mix ( 1xCircLigase reaction buﬀer , 2 . 5 mM MnCl 2 , 50 µM ATP , 100 U CircLigase ) . Samples were incubated at 60°C for 120 min , followed by an inactivation step at 80°C for 10 min . cDNA was ethanol precipitated ( 3 volumes ice - cold 100 % ethanol , 75 mM sodium acetate [ pH 5 . 5 ] , 0 . 05 mg / mL glycogen [ Invitrogen ] ) . After an overnight incubation at - 80°C , the cDNA was centrifuged ( 4°C , 30 min at 17000 g ) and resuspended in 20 µl ultra - pure water . To remove non - ligated adapter # 3 , resuspended cDNA was further puriﬁed using the Agencourt AMPure XP beads ( Beackman Coul - ter ) by mixing 1 . 8x of AMPure bead slurry with the cDNA and incubation at room temperature for 5 min . The subsequent steps were carried out with a DynaMag - 96 Side Magnet ( Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) according to the manufacturer’s protocol . Following the washing steps with 70 % ethanol , DNA was resuspended in 20 μ l ultra - pure water and the dsDNA library was prepared . 4 . 2 Library preparation and sequencing To add the TruSeq Universal Adapter ( # 6 ) sequence as well as the TruSeq Illumina indexes ( # 7 - 30 for next generation sequencing , see Table S4 ) , the PCR reaction mix ( 1x Q5 HotStart reaction buﬀer , 0 . 1 mM dNTPs , 1 U Q5 HotStart Polymerase [ NEB ] ) was added to 6 µl ssDNA , 4 nM selection primer # 4 ( primer extends 4 nucleotides into mCherry transcript to avoid the enrichment of ssDNA - adapter products ) or # 5 ( primer extends 3 nucleotides into 5S rRNA transcript ) , 0 . 5 µM TruSeq Universal Adapter # 6 and 0 . 5 µM Illumina Index primer ( one of # 7 - 30 , see Table S4 ) . A 15 - cycle PCR program was used : initial denaturation at 98°C for 30 s followed by a denaturation step at 98°C for 15 s , primer annealing at 65°C for 30 s and extension at 72°C for 30 s , followed by a ﬁnal extension 72°C for 5 min . Samples were chilled at 4°C for 5 min . After cool - down , 5 U of Exonuclease I ( ExoI , NEB ) were added , incubated at 37°C for 30 min followed by mixing 1 . 8x volume of Agencourt AMPure XP beads to the PCR / ExoI mix and puriﬁed according to manufacturer’s protocol . Samples were eluted in 20 µl ultra - pure water . After library preparation , samples were analyzed using the TapeStation 2200 DNA ScreenTape assay ( Agilent ) and the molarity of each library was determined by the average size of the peak maxima and the concentrations obtained from the Qubit ﬂuorimeter ( Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) . Libraries were multiplexed by mixing the same molar concentration ( 2 - 5 nM ) of each sample library , and sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencing system using 2x50 bp paired - end reads . 10 not peer - reviewed ) is the author / funder .

Alignment was performed using bowtie2 11 in local alignment mode ( bowtie2 - - local ) . For full alignment details see Supplementary Data 1 . Reverse transcriptase ( RT ) drop - out positions were indicated by the end position of Illumina Read 2 ( the second read on the same fragment ) . Drop - out positions were identiﬁed using an in - house Perl script ( can be provided upon request ) . Reads that were aligned only to the ﬁrst 19 bp were eliminated from downstream analysis , as these correspond to the RT primer sequence . In addition , reads that covered the full length ( i . e . reads that spanned from the RT - primer to the TSS ) of the sequences were also removed , as they are non - informative for SHAPE - seq RT drop - out calculation . For each position upstream of the RT - primer , the number of drop - outs detected was summed . This process was repeated for both the mCherry mRNA and the 5S rRNA sequence After the trimming , the reporter libraries averaged ∼ 500 , 000± 85 , 000 total reads per reporter library ( 31 total ) , or ∼ 13 . 204 ± 7 . 002 % of the initial reads number for each library ( see Supplemental Data 1 for reads per position on all SHAPE - Seq libraries ) . Interestingly , the 5S rRNA library which was used as a positive control yielded ∼ 6 , 000 , 000 reads after trimming . The diﬀerence between the two targets may have been due to the poor choice of the RT primer for mCherry , which also binds to E . coli 23S rRNA . To facilitate proper signal comparison , all libraries of each construct ( 8 per construct ) were normalized to have the same total number of reads . For each library j and position i = 1 , . . . , L , we normalized the number of drop - outs D j ( i ) according to : ˆ D j ( i ) = D j ( i ) (cid:80) Li = 1 D j ( i ) × M , where L is the length of the sequence under investigation after RT primer removal , and M is the maximal total number of drop - outs over all samples : M = max j { L (cid:88) i = 1 D j ( i ) } . Note that M enables comparison between samples with diﬀerent numbers of drop - outs , and also serves as a large constant in order to avoid dividing two very small numbers in the next step . The SHAPE - seq ratio was calculated for each strain s at each position i , as follows : R s ( i ) = ˆ D s , mod ( i ) ˆ D s , non − mod ( i ) , ( 7 ) where ˆ D s , mod ( i ) and ˆ D s , non − mod ( i ) are the normalized drop - outs of the NAI - modiﬁed and the non - modiﬁed ( DMSO ) libraries , respectively ( see Section 4 . 1 ) . The normalized reads as a function of position from the TSS are supplied in Supplemental Data 1 . 4 . 4 Reactivity analysis SHAPE - seq reactivity scores were calculated using SEQualyzer . 12 Brieﬂy , SEQualyzer calculates SHAPE - seq reactivity scores by ﬁrst modelling RT drop - out at a particular position as Poisson distribution , and then attempting to infer the probability for a base to be single - stranded . High reactivity score corresponds to high probability for single - stranded base , and low reactivity means 11 not peer - reviewed ) is the author / funder . All rights reserved .

We compared the performance of the reactivity score to our simpler ratio analysis ( Eq . 7 ) . We assumed that in general modiﬁcations and RT drop - out are not correlated , thus dividing the modiﬁed signal by the unmodiﬁed removes the RT - drop out signal , while retaining the reactivity information . In Supp . Fig . 4 , we show that for the case of 5S RNA and the PP7wt binding site with δ = 5 construct , this operation indeed led to complete decorrelation , thus validating our approach . While the reactivity score based on SEQualizer has been used to analyze previous data , we are of the opinion that an unﬁltered approach is more beneﬁcial for the type of analysis that we carried out in this paper . 12 not peer - reviewed ) is the author / funder .
