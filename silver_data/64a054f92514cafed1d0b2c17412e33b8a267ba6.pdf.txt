The Relations of Gender and Personality Traits on Different Creativities : A Dual - Process Theory Account Wei - Lun Lin Fo Guang University Kung - Yu Hsu National Chung Cheng University Hsueh - Chih Chen National Taiwan Normal University Jenn - Wu Wang Fo Guang University In the present study we examine the ways in which gender and personality traits are related to divergent thinking and insight problem solving . According to the dual - process theory account of creativity , we propose that gender and personality traits might influence the ease and choice of the processing mode and , hence , affect 2 creativity measures in different ways . Over 300 participants’ responses on the Abbreviated Torrance Test for Adults ( Chen , 2006 ) , HEXACO Personality Inventory ( Ashton & Lee , 2009 ; Lee & Ashton , 2004 ) , Raven’s Advanced Progressive Matrices ( Yu , 1993 ) , and performance while conducting insight - problem tasks , are collected . The results show that Openness was positively correlated with divergent thinking performance , whereas Emotionality was negatively correlated with insight problem - solving performance . Women performed better on divergent thinking tests , whereas men’s capabilities were superior on insight problem tasks . Furthermore , Openness exhibited a mediating effect on the relationships between gender and divergent thinking . The relationships among gender , personality , and creative performance , as well as the implications of these findings on cultural differences and real - field creativity , are discussed . Keywords : HEXACO , personality trait , gender , divergent thinking , insight problem - solving Creativity is closely related to human development and achieve - ment at the individual or societal level . Researchers have investi - gated creativity from several aspects ( e . g . , the 4P model , or the Person , the Product , the Process , and the Press ; Mooney , 1963 ; Rhodes , 1961 ) . Various measures are used to differentiate high from low creative abilities . When considering people’s creative potentials , divergent thinking is the main focus of the “psycho - metric approach , ” and creative problem solving ( e . g . , insight prob - lem solving ) is extensively investigated in the “cognitive ap - proach” ( Sternberg & Lubart , 1999 ; Sternberg , Lubart , Kaufman , & Pretz , 2005 ) . Both are representative indexes that were widely applied . Nevertheless , theories and accumulating evidence have shown that these two measures of creativity might involve two distinct processes ( Perkins , 1998 ; Sternberg et al . , 2005 ; Wake - field , 1989 ) . These two processes are correlated with different cognitive factors ( Lin , 2006 ; Lin , Hsu , Chen , & Chang , 2011 ; Lin & Lien , 2011 ) . Further , individuals’ performances on the two measures are not correlated ( Lin , Lien , & Jen , 2005 ) . In the present study we investigate how personality traits , as well as gender , correlate differently with divergent thinking and creative problem - solving abilities in accordance with the dual - process theory ac - count of creativity ( Lin & Lien , 2011 ) . In the following para - graphs , we briefly review the distinction between these two types of creativity measures . Our predictions about the ways they relate to individuals’ personality traits and gender , based on the dual - process theory account of creativity , are then proposed . Distinction Between Divergent Thinking and Creative Problem Solving The concept of divergent thinking refers to the ability to gener - ate diverse and numerous responses to a given question that increases the likely output of creative ideas ( Guilford , 1956 ) . It serves as the theoretical basis for many creativity tests ( Guilford , 1963 ; Torrance , 1966 ; Wallach & Kogan , 1965 ) in the psycho - metric approach for creativity ( Sternberg & Lubart , 1999 ; Stern - berg et al . , 2005 ) . For example , the examinee is asked to list as many as possible interesting and unusual uses for a brick in accordance with the Unusual Uses Test ( Guildford , 1956 ) . Four main indexes are then applied to assess responses and reflect divergent thinking ability : ( 1 ) The fluency index refers to the This article was published Online First December 12 , 2011 .

On the other hand , the tradition of investigating creative problem - solving ability in the cognitive approach traces back to studies about insight problems by Gestalt psychologists . Problem solvers usually encounter obstacles at first , then later invent a sudden “a - ha ! ” solution ( Dominowski , 1995 ; Ohlsson , 1984 ; Wal - las , 1926 ) . For example , in a situation in which participants were required to attach a candle to a wall by using the only objects that were available , they usually encountered obstacles ( functional fixedness of the tack box as a container , not a candlestick ) and could not successfully solve the problem ( i . e . , the candle problem ; Duncker , 1945 ) . This type of problem is considered a “productive problem” and requires more creativity than a “reproductive prob - lem” ( such as algebraic problems ) because it cannot be solved by the existing rules . Instead , a reconstruction of the problem repre - sentation is required to achieve success ( Weisberg , 1995 ) . The number of correctly solved insight problems is usually used as an index of creative ability in this approach . Wakefield ( 1989 ) differentiated problem types along ill - versus well - defined and open - versus closed - solution dimensions . A di - vergent thinking task is described as a well - defined , open - solution problem , whereas an insight problem is considered as an ill - defined , closed - solution one . With respect to the essential proper - ties of creativity ( i . e . , novelty and appropriateness ; Mayer , 1999 ) , an open - solution , divergent thinking question better emphasizes the novelty aspect of creativity ( e . g . , numerating the uses of a brick without considering whether they are practical . Only the number and unusualness of the responses are scored ) . In contrast , an insight or creative problem with a specific solution goal ( e . g . , successfully attaching a candle to a wall ) demands ideas that are novel as well as appropriate , which are consistent with the problem constraints ( e . g . , using only objects available ; Lin & Lien , 2011 ; Lin et al . , 2005 ) . Empirical evidence indicates that individuals’ performance on the two tasks did not correlate with each other ( e . g . , Lin et al . , 2005 ) , as well as that various cognitive factors correlated differ - ently to these two measures . For example , intelligence is found to exhibit moderate positive correlations with creative problem solv - ing , but it correlates with divergent thinking to a lesser extent ( Sternberg et al . , 2005 ) . Similarly , working memory capacity is found to be positively correlated with insight problem solving , but not with divergent - thinking performance ( Lin & Lien , 2011 ) . Individuals with better divergent thinking performance are found to exhibit lower cognitive inhibition ability ( as measured by a retrieval - induced - forgetting paradigm , Anderson , Bjork , & Bjork , 1994 ) than controls , whereas individuals with better insight problem - solving performance do not ( Lin , 2006 ) . In addition , the aspects of the breadth of attention are found to exhibit different roles in divergent thinking and insight problem solving ( Lin et al . , 2011 ) . Lin and Lien ( 2011 ) suggested that these results reflected dif - ferent processes that might involve in divergent thinking and creative problem solving with respect to the framework of dual - process theories of cognition ( J . St . B . T . Evans , 2003 , 2007 ; Sloman , 1996 ; Stanovich & West , 2000 ) . Dual - process theories have been proposed to account for individuals’ cognitive process - ing on wide - ranging cognitive functions , including learning and memory , reasoning , decision making , and judgment ( J . St . B . T . Evans , 2008 ) . These theories assume that people possess two alternative process systems under one cognitive function . System 1 ( or the heuristic system ) processes information in an associative , intuitive , and effortless manner without capacity limits . It is evo - lutionarily early and comprises prior knowledge and experience . On the other hand , System 2 ( or the analytic system ) involves logical and rule - based processes in which execution relies on cognitive resources . It is considered evolutionarily recent and permits abstract thinking . For example , in a syllogism task , a logically correct validity judgment is proposed to be derived from System 2 processing , whereas a judgment influenced by prior experiences or beliefs without considering its logical status is derived from System 1 processing ( i . e . , the belief - bias effect ; J . St . B . T . Evans , 2003 ) . Different tasks also might require differential involvement of both systems ( Stanovich , 1999 ) . With respect to these view - points pertaining to the context of creativity , Lin and Lien ( 2011 ) proposed that idea generation in divergent thinking , which emphasizes novelty , primarily relies on associative , ef - fortless System 1 processing . On the other hand , the ability to generate plausible solutions in creative problem solving reflects both novelty and appropriateness . It requires System 1 as well as rule - based , resource - limited System 2 processing . According to Stanovich ( 1999 ) , some individual difference vari - ables could account for the choice of processing mode ; for exam - ple , cognitive style . Cognitive style 1 is a combination of mental abilities and personality ( Guastello , Shissler , Driscoll , & Hyde , 1998 ) . Research also revealed that there were gender differences in cognitive style ( e . g . , Sadler - Smith , 2001 ) . Therefore , we hypoth - esize that personality traits and gender might also influence the ease and choice of the processing mode . We explored how per - sonality traits and gender correlate differently with respect to the differential involvement of System 1 and System 2 processing during the divergent thinking and insight problem - solving mea - sures . 1 Zhang and Sternberg ( 2006 ) proposed a “mode of thinking” in discus - sions about the cognitive styles . The three modes of thinking , which include analytic , holistic , and integrative , are similar conceptions to the dual - process theory ( Stanovich & West , 2000 ) . However , the dual - process theory ( System 1 and System 2 ) focuses on depicting the fundamental information processing modes and is evident in various cognitive func - tions . On the other hand , cognitive style represents a higher level concep - tion , a combination of mental abilities and personality , or the ways in which people prefer to use their abilities ( Guastello et al . , 1998 ) . Besides , there are various concepts or taxonomies of cognitive styles ( Zhang & Sternberg , 2009 ) . As Stanovich and West ( 2000 ) pointed out , the dual - process theory depicted computational capacity at the algorithmic level of analysis , whereas cognitive or thinking styles indexed individual differ - ences at the intentional level of analysis . Both contributed independently to the variances of individual differences in performance on various cognitive tasks ( Stanovich & West , 1998 ) . Further , the two conceptions are different in malleability that might be affected by long - or short - term practice ( Baron , 1985 ) . 113 GENDER , PERSONALITY TRAITS AND CREATIVENESS T h i s do c u m e n t i s c opy r i gh t e d by t h e A m e r i ca n P s y c ho l og i ca l A ss o c i a ti on o r on e o f it s a lli e d pub li s h e r s .

The Relationships Between Personality Traits and Creativity Several personality traits have been identified as being related to creativity . At the surface trait level , creative individuals are found to be more reserved , dominant , serious , inattentive to rules , sensitive , and self - sufficient ( Guastello , 2009 ; Runco , 2007 ) . At the source trait 2 level , studies based on the five - factor model ( McCrae & Costa , 2008 ) consistently find positive relationships between Extraversion , Open - ness to Experience , and creativity ( Batey , Chamorro - Premuzic , & Furnham , 2010 ; Batey & Furnham , 2006 ; for the meta - analysis of the Big Five source traits with creative behavior , see Guastello , 2009 ) . Conscientiousness is sometimes found to be negatively related to creativity ( Batey et al . , 2010 ; Batey & Furnham , 2006 ) . However , Feist’s ( 1998 ) meta - analysis indicated that although artists were less conscientious than nonartists , scientists were more conscientious than nonscientists . Researchers also found that creative individuals possess some negative traits , such as deviance ( Eisenman , 1997 ) and psy - choticism ( Eysenck , 1995 ) . Although the results are fruitful , some paradoxical personalities existed . As Csikszentmihalyi ( 1996 ) pointed out in his interviews with highly successful individuals , these inter - viewees seemed to be both logical and naı¨ve , disciplined yet playful , introverted and extraverted , realistic but imaginative , objective but passionate , and feminine and masculine . The above results were usually derived from studying eminent people in various domains or assessing normal people’s creative potentials using certain measurements . As mentioned above , al - though different personality traits have been linked to scientific and artistic creativity ( other artists’ traits included norm doubting , nonconformity , independence , hostility , and lack of warmth , and traits of scientists were dominance , arrogance , and high self - confidence ; Feist , 1999 ) , studies that investigated normal people mostly utilized divergent thinking tests to differentiate high from low creative people . The differences of personality traits between people with high and low creative problem - solving potentials seem to have been less extensively investigated . Given that the two measures of divergent thinking and creative problem solving exhibit different properties and involve different processes , their relationships with different personality traits merit clarification . For example , Neuroticism or Emotionality , a con - struct in the five - factor model , is found closely related to mental pathology ( Matthews , Deary , & Whiteman , 2003 ) . It might hinder System 2 processing in which an objective , rational , and rule - based process is required that underlies creative problem solving . However , it might not necessarily hinder associative , intuitive System 1 processing that divergent thinking mainly requires . Some evidence gave support to this speculation . For example , research has found that Psychoticism ( Eysenck , 1995 ) or mood disorders ( Nowakowska , Strong , Santosa , Wang , & Ketter , 2005 ) were correlated with divergent thinking performance , whereas positive and stable emotions facilitated insight problem - solving abilities ( G . Kaufmann , 2003 ) . On the other hand , Openness to Experience might especially facilitate System 1 processing ( and hence diver - gent thinking performance ) when the richness of ideas , but not necessarily appropriateness , could effortlessly be associated . Pre - vious research did find that Openness to Experience and divergent thinking were closely related ( Batey & Furnham , 2006 ; Batey et al . , 2010 ) . It is still questionable whether Openness to Experience helps to generate novel and appropriate ideas that could fulfill the constraints of solving goals in creative problem solving . The present study utilizes the HEXACO Personality Inventory ( Ashton & Lee , 2009 ; Lee & Ashton , 2004 ) , which is considered more generalizable and inclusive than the five - factor model . Hon - esty / Humility , Emotionality , Extraversion , Agreeableness , Consci - entiousness , and Openness to Experience are assessed to determine the different relationships between personality traits and the two creativity measures . The Relationships Between Gender and Creativity Inconsistent results of gender differences in creativity have been obtained in the past ( J . C . Kaufman , 2006 ) . Some studies showed that no differences existed ( e . g . , P . C . Cheung , Lau , Chan , & Wu , 2004 ) , but other studies found that women performed better on the divergent thinking tests than men ( Dudek , Strobel , & Runco , 1993 ; Kim & Michael , 1995 ; Kuhn & Holling , 2009 ) . Few studies have investigated gender differences in creative problem solving . However , some re - search has found that women possessed a more intuitive cognitive style , whereas men were found to be more sensational ( Sadler - Smith , 2001 ) . Further , women were determined to be more interested in people , while men were more attracted by objects ( Baron - Cohen , 2003 ; Connellan , Baron - Cohen , Wheelwright , Batki , & Ahluwalia , 2000 ) . Some researchers thus proposed that women preferred holistic , intuitive thinking and relied more on System 1 processing , whereas men were good at analytic thinking and System 2 processing ( Wang , 2011 ) . According to the dual - process theory account of creativity ( Lin & Lien , 2011 ) , divergent thinking mainly relies on System 1 process - ing , while creative problem solving also requires System 2 process - ing . It is hypothesized that women could perform better on divergent thinking tests , as previously findings have shown , whereas men could be more adept at solving creative or insight problems . In the following experiment , we use a divergent thinking test ( Abbreviated Torrance Test for Adults [ ATTA ] ; Chen , 2006 ) , an insight problem task ( one of the representative creative problems ) , the HEXACO – PI – R ( Revised HEXACO Personality Inventory , Lee & Ashton , 2004 ) , as well as Raven’s Advanced Progressive Matrices ( APM ; Yu , 1993 ; a test for general intelligence 3 ) , to investigate the relationships between personality traits , gender , and 2 The surface traits refer to personality traits that are the most specific and proximally related to external behaviors . The source traits refer to personality traits that are the results of factor - analysis on numerous per - sonality tests ( Guastello , 2009 ) . The present study examined the relation - ships between creativity and the source traits ( HEXACO ) because the source traits , which were more basic , were thought to contain surface - level traits . We also could provide exploratory data of the Taiwanese sample and compare it with past findings on the relationship between the Big Five and creativity in different cultures . 3 According to the reviews of Sternberg and colleagues ( 2005 ) , the relationships between intelligence and divergent thinking were more con - sistent with the threshold theory . It stated that intelligence and creativity are correlated up to an IQ of 120 , and the relationship dissolves for higher IQs . However , the relationships between intelligence and creative problem solving are consistently correlated even for higher IQs . Besides , our participants were recruited from five universities and were possibly diverse in intelligence . Thus , we collected intelligence scores in the present study as a controlled variable . We also inspected its different roles on divergent thinking and creative problem solving . 114 LIN , HSU , CHEN , AND WANG T h i s do c u m e n t i s c opy r i gh t e d by t h e A m e r i ca n P s y c ho l og i ca l A ss o c i a ti on o r on e o f it s a lli e d pub li s h e r s .

Different relationships between personality traits and gender with different creativity measures are expected . In addition , previous studies have inspected the relationships between personality and creativity , as well as the connection between gender and creativity ( as described in the previous re - views , these analyses were often with a single creativity measure , divergent thinking ) and the relationships between personality and gender ( e . g . , Costa , Terracciano , & McCrae , 2001 ; Schmitt , Realo , Voracek , & Allik , 2008 ) . To our knowledge , there are no studies about how personality and gender interact or mediate each other to contribute to creative behavior . The moderation and mediation effects of personality and gender on divergent thinking and insight problem - solving performance also are explored in the present study . Method Participants and General Procedure A total of 320 undergraduate students from five universities in Taiwan participated in this study ( 57 . 8 % women ; M age (cid:1) 19 . 45 years , SD (cid:1) 1 . 89 ) . The collection of different university students prevents homogeneity and enables greater variance of our data . Each participant provided informed consent and participated in some or all subtests ( i . e . , insight problem task and HEXACO : n (cid:1) 284 ; ATTA : n (cid:1) 301 ; APM : n (cid:1) 291 ) 4 in consecutive 2 - week anonymous group testing sessions that were 1 - hr in duration . All participants received a gift and were debriefed when they finished all of the tasks . Instruments and Procedures Creative problem - solving measure—Insight problem task . Eighteen insight problems ( nine verbal and nine figural ) were first selected from an insight - problems inventory Web site at Indiana University ( http : / / www . indiana . edu / (cid:2) bobweb / d4 . html ) . The in - clusion of these problems fulfilled the criterion of “pure” insight problems that necessarily require a reconstructing process , as suggested by Weisberg ( 1995 ) . A pretest ( n (cid:1) 52 ) on these 18 problems was then conducted . According to the results of the pretest , we chose five verbal problems and five figural problems with moderate difficulty levels ( i . e . , ranging from 25 % to 70 % for verbal problems and 21 . 6 % to 62 . 7 % for figural problems ) . The 10 insight problem task for this study can be found in the Appendix . The proceedings of the verbal and figural problems were coun - terbalanced between participants . Participants were given 20 min to complete the task . At the end , they were required to report whether they had previously seen and / or known the answers to any of the problems . The performance scores were calculated as the percentage of unfamiliar problems that were answered correctly within the verbal , figural , and 10 total insight problems . The participants’ average accuracy rates on the verbal , figural , and total problems were 38 % ( SD (cid:1) . 29 ) , 43 % ( SD (cid:1) . 28 ) , and 40 % ( SD (cid:1) . 25 ) . The correlation of accuracy rates between verbal and figural problems was . 55 , p (cid:3) . 01 . Cronbach’s alpha coefficients were . 54 , . 51 , . 68 for the scores on the verbal , figural , and whole problems , respectively . Divergent thinking measure—Abbreviated ATTA . The Chinese version of the ATTA ( Chen , 2006 ) is a translated version of ATTA ( Goff & Torrance , 2002 ) . It includes three subtests : a verbal test ( question enumeration ) and two figural tests ( figural completion ) . Three minutes is allowed for each subtest . The test , which was developed as a large - sample norm in Taiwan for undergraduate students , established satisfactory reliability and va - lidity results ( Chen , 2006 ) . Participants’ responses were scored by two independent raters for fluency , flexibility , originality , and elaboration , which are among the most representative indexes for divergent thinking abilities . The interrater reliability coefficients for these four kinds of scores ranged from . 83 to . 97 . The fluency scores were simply the total number of responses generated by each participant . The flexibility scores represented the number of different categories of responses . The originality scores represented the sum of scores on each response in comparison to the norm and scored as either 0 or 1 . The elaboration scores of the figural subtests were scored as the number of elaborated decorations in each response . Participants’ performance on the ATTA was scored as follows : fluency : M (cid:1) 12 . 11 , SD (cid:1) 4 . 01 ; flexibility : M (cid:1) 7 . 87 , SD (cid:1) 2 . 69 ; originality : M (cid:1) 3 . 22 , SD (cid:1) 2 . 42 ; elaboration : M (cid:1) 5 . 36 , SD (cid:1) 4 . 31 . The scores for these indexes were mostly significantly cor - related with those of each of the others ( the Pearson’s r ranged from . 31 to . 83 , p (cid:3) . 01 ) ; however , originality and elaboration exhibited no correlation ( r (cid:1) . 07 , p (cid:1) . 24 ) . Personality measure—HEXACO – PI – R . The HEXACO – PI – R ( Ashton & Lee , 2009 ; Lee & Ashton , 2004 ) measures six personality traits : Honesty / Humility , Emotionality , Extraversion , Agreeableness , Conscientiousness , and Openness to Experience . These six personality traits came from the factor analysis results of personality lexicons of six different languages . As previously mentioned , the inventory was considered to be more generalizable and inclusive than the five - factor model . There are 16 items for each personality trait , and a 5 - response Likert scale is used from 1 ( strongly disagree ) to 5 ( strongly agree ) . This inventory was translated into the Chinese version by one of the authors . Two Chinese personality psychologists who were trained in the United States and the United Kingdom examined the quality of this translation . The Chinese version of this inventory then was trans - lated into English . The back - translation version of this inventory was checked by authors of this inventory and the incorrect trans - lations were modified . Cronbach’s alpha coefficients , which ranged from . 74 to . 82 , were obtained for the scores on these six scales of the Chinese version in this study . The different types of measurement equivalence ( i . e . , configural , metric , and error vari - ance ) of the HEXACO – PI – R were found in a multiple age group ranging from early adolescence to adulthood by the use of confir - matory factor analysis ( Hsu , 2010 ) . General ability measure—APM . The Chinese version of APM ( Yu , 1993 ) was administered to assess participants’ general intelligence . In this test , every test item consists of the presenta - tions of several graphs , including an empty one . Participants have to find the relationships between them by choosing the most 4 The participants were also assessed with the Adult Temperament Questionnaire ( D . E . Evans & Rothbart , 2007 ) . The results are reported in another paper . 115 GENDER , PERSONALITY TRAITS AND CREATIVENESS T h i s do c u m e n t i s c opy r i gh t e d by t h e A m e r i ca n P s y c ho l og i ca l A ss o c i a ti on o r on e o f it s a lli e d pub li s h e r s .

The test has established stable reliability and validity results : The retest reliability was . 91 ( Fould , Forbes , & Bevans , 1962 ) , and the correlations between the APM scores and intelli - gence tests were high ( e . g . , rs (cid:1) . 4 to . 6 , Schweizer & Moosbrug - ger , 2004 ) . For a proper time control , we excluded the first 12 items , which were found to add little to the discriminative power of the test ( Bors & Stokes , 1998 ) , and used Items 13 to 36 . The total admin - istrating time was 25 min . The performance scores were calculated as the total number of items correct . Our participants’ scores ranged from 0 to 23 , with M s (cid:1) 12 . 45 , SD (cid:1) 5 . 16 . Results The Relationships Between the Two Measures of Creativity and General Intelligence We first examined the relationships between participants’ per - formances on divergent thinking and insight problem solving . As shown in Table 1 , although fluency and flexibility scores exhibited small positive correlations with verbal , figural , and total insight problem - solving accuracy ( rs (cid:1) . 19 , . 22 , . 24 ; rs (cid:1) . 23 , . 24 , . 26 , p (cid:3) . 01 , respectively ) , the indexes of originality and elaboration were not correlated with insight problem - solving performance ( rs (cid:1) . 01 to . 11 , ns ) . Because the correlations between the four indexes of divergent thinking and the two indexes of insight problem solving were high , we partialed out the effects of other indexes within one task . The extent of correlations was smaller between fluency , flexibility , and insight problem - solving perfor - mance ( rs ranged from . 12 to . 19 , p (cid:3) . 05 ) . These results indicate that individuals’ performances on the two creativity measures were only slightly related on some of the indexes . The correlations between the participants’ creative performance and APM scores , referred to as their general intelligence and representing their cognitive abilities , were also computed . As Table 1 shows , participants’ divergent thinking performance— fluency , flexibility , and elaboration—were positively correlated with their APM scores ( rs (cid:1) . 21 , . 23 , . 20 , respectively , small effect sizes as defined by Cohen , 1988 ; p (cid:3) . 01 ) . There was no corre - lation between intelligence scores and the originality index ( r (cid:1) . 01 , ns ) . On the other hand , participants’ APM scores were more highly correlated to their insight problem - solving performance , with rs (cid:1) . 39 , . 43 , and . 46 , p (cid:3) . 01 , to verbal , figural , and total problem - solving accuracy , respectively . All of these coefficients achieved a medium level of effect sizes , as defined by Cohen ( 1988 ) . These results fit well with previous findings that creative problem - solving ability depended more on intelligence than did the divergent thinking performance ( Sternberg et al . , 2005 ) . The Relationships Between Two Creativity Measures and Personality Traits One of the main purposes of the present study was to inspect how personality traits correlated differently with divergent think - ing and creative problem - solving performance . As Table 2 shows , Openness to Experience was positively correlated to divergent thinking indexes ( r s (cid:1) . 24 , . 22 , . 24 , . 19 , p (cid:3) . 01 , for fluency , flexibility , originality , and elaboration indexes , respectively ) . Ex - traversion was also positively correlated to most of the divergent thinking indexes ( r s (cid:1) . 14 , . 13 , . 16 , p (cid:3) . 05 , for fluency , flexi - bility , and elaboration indexes , respectively , but not to the origi - nality index , r (cid:1) . 10 , ns ) . Nevertheless , neither Openness to Experience or Extraversion exhibited correlations with most of the participants’ insight problem - solving performance ( rs ranged from . 00 to . 09 , ns , except the verbal insight problem - solving perfor - mance exhibited a weak positive correlation with Openness to Experience , r (cid:1) . 13 , p (cid:3) . 05 ) . On the other hand , Emotionality was found to be negatively correlated to insight problem - solving performance ( rs (cid:1) (cid:4) . 16 , (cid:4) . 13 , (cid:4) . 17 , p (cid:3) . 01 , for verbal , figural , and total insight problem - solving accuracy , respectively ) , but not to divergent thinking performance ( rs ranged from . 01 to . 08 , ns ; even emotionality and elaboration index were positively corre - lated , r (cid:1) . 12 , p (cid:3) . 05 ) . Honesty , Agreeableness , and Conscien - tiousness were not correlated to either divergent thinking or insight problem - solving performance . The above results showed a pattern as predicted : Divergent thinking performances related positively to Openness to Experience and Extraversion , whereas insight problem - solving performances were hindered by Emotionality .

The Relationships Between Two Creativity Measures and Gender Another purpose of the present study was to inspect how gender correlated differently to the two creativity measures . We separately analyzed the performance of our female ( n (cid:1) 181 for ATTA and n (cid:1) 169 for insight problem task ) and male ( n (cid:1) 118 for ATTA and n (cid:1) 111 for insight problem task ) participants on the ATTA and insight problem task . The results , which are shown in Table 3 , indicate that our male participants performed better on most of the insight problem - solving indexes than their female counterparts : . 48 (cid:5) . 28 versus . 40 (cid:5) . 28 , t ( 282 ) (cid:1) 2 . 57 , p (cid:3) . 05 , d 5 (cid:1) . 31 , for the verbal accuracy ; and . 45 (cid:5) . 26 versus . 37 (cid:5) . 24 , t ( 282 ) (cid:1) 2 . 45 , p (cid:3) . 05 , d (cid:1) . 30 , for the total accuracy . Except for the figural accuracy , only marginally significant effect of gender existed , . 41 (cid:5) . 30 vs . . 35 (cid:5) . 28 , t ( 282 ) (cid:1) 1 . 7 , p (cid:1) . 09 . On the contrary , female participants performed better in most of the divergent thinking indexes over male participants : 12 . 48 (cid:5) 4 . 0 versus 11 . 53 (cid:5) 4 . 19 , t ( 297 ) (cid:1) (cid:4) 1 . 97 , p (cid:1) . 05 , d (cid:1) . 23 , for fluency ; 8 . 15 (cid:5) 2 . 59 versus 7 . 42 (cid:5) 2 . 80 , t ( 297 ) (cid:1) (cid:4) 2 . 29 , p (cid:3) . 05 , d (cid:1) . 27 , for flexibility ; and 6 . 04 (cid:5) 4 . 43 versus 4 . 33 (cid:5) 3 . 94 , t ( 297 ) (cid:1) (cid:4) 3 . 41 , p (cid:3) . 01 , d (cid:1) . 40 , for elaboration . The exception was that female participants did not perform better on the originality index than male counterparts : 3 . 36 (cid:5) 2 . 31 vs . 2 . 98 (cid:5) 2 . 58 , t ( 297 ) (cid:1) (cid:4) 1 . 33 , ns . These results indicate the different gender effects on divergent thinking and insight problem - solving performance and support our prediction . The Relationships Between Personality Traits , Gender , and Two Creativity Measures To understand how gender and personality traits contribute to the performance of divergent thinking and insight problem solving , several hierarchical multiple - regression analyses were conducted . In all of these analyses , the steps of the variables that entered the equations were as follows : ( 1 ) APM ( where intelligence scores could be controlled ) , ( 2 ) gender , ( 3 ) Honesty - Humility , Extraver - sion , Emotionality , Agreeableness , Conscientiousness , and Open - ness to Experience . All of the personality variables in the final step were entered simultaneously . As Table 4 shows , the APM score accounted for 4 to 18 % of variance of two creativity indexes , (cid:6) F ( 1 , 318 ) (cid:1) 11 . 91 to 67 . 65 , p (cid:3) . 001 , except for the originality index of divergent thinking . When the gender variable was entered into the equation ( Model 2 ) , the amount of variance explained in both creativity measures ( (cid:6) R 2 (cid:1) . 01 to . 04 , p (cid:3) . 05 ) significantly increased from Model 1 , in which only the APM scores was included , (cid:6) F ( 1 , 317 ) (cid:1) 3 . 91 to 12 . 51 , p (cid:3) . 05 . When personality variables were further included in Model 3 , the amount of variance explained ( (cid:6) R 2 (cid:1) . 05 , for all the above three indexes , p (cid:3) . 01 ) in divergent thinking perfor - mance increased further , (cid:6) F ( 6 , 311 ) (cid:1) 3 . 10 to 3 . 15 , p (cid:3) . 01 , but not in the insight problem - solving performance . When intelligence , gender , and personality were included as predictors ( Model 3 ) , APM scores could predict significantly both creative performances ( with (cid:7) s (cid:1) . 34 to . 41 for insight problem - solving , p (cid:3) . 001 , and (cid:7) s (cid:1) . 20 to . 21 for divergent thinking , p (cid:3) . 001 , except originality ) . The predictive powers were larger for the insight problem - solving consideration . Gender significantly pre - dicted some of the indexes of both creative performances , but in an opposite direction . For insight problem solving , (cid:7) s (cid:1) (cid:4) . 14 ( p (cid:3) . 01 ) and (cid:4) . 12 ( p (cid:3) . 01 ) for verbal and total accuracy . On the other hand , (cid:7) (cid:1) . 16 ( p (cid:3) . 01 ) for the elaboration index on divergent thinking . As for the predictive powers of personality traits on creativity measures , Openness to Experience could significantly predict all of the four indexes of divergent thinking ( with (cid:7) s (cid:1) . 19 , . 18 , . 20 , . 15 , p (cid:3) . 05 , for fluency , flexibility , originality , and elaboration indexes , respectively ) . Nevertheless , it could only predict one index , verbal accuracy , of insight performance ( with (cid:7) (cid:1) . 13 , p (cid:3) . 01 ) . In addition , Extraversion could only predict elaboration scores in divergent thinking ( (cid:7) (cid:1) . 13 , p (cid:3) . 05 ) . The above results indicate that , after controlling the effects of intelligence on two creativity performances , our male and female participants performed better at different creativity tasks ( i . e . , insight problem solving and divergent thinking ) , respectively . As for the roles 5 The effect size , d , is computed according to the formula : d (cid:1) t [ ( 1 / n 1 ) (cid:8) ( 1 / n 2 ) ] . 5 ( Cortina & Nouri , 2000 ) , where t refers to the statistical value of t test , n 1 and n 2 refer to the numbers of female and male participants . This formula is used for an unequal cell condition .

Personality also seemed to exhibit a lesser effect on insight problem solving than divergent thinking . Inspecting Table 4 , it was found that , compared to Model 2 , the predictive powers of gender were diminished when the personality variables were entered into the regression analysis in Model 3 for the indexes of fluency and flexibility . These results revealed that the mediation effects of personality traits ( especially Openness to Experience ) could be found . The mediation analyses were further conducted to investigate whether different gender predicted differ - ent creative performances through personality traits . The results revealed ( see Figure 1A ) that the initial associations between gender and fluency scores were eliminated by the inclusion of Openness to Experience , indicating a full mediation effect ( Sobel z value (cid:1) 2 . 05 , p (cid:3) . 05 ) . The associations between gender and flexibility scores were also attenuated by the mediation of Open - ness ( see Figure 1B ) , to a marginally significant degree ( Sobel z value (cid:1) 1 . 74 , p (cid:1) . 08 ) . Other analyses did not show any signif - icant mediation effects of personality on the relationships between gender and creative performances . In addition , we examined whether gender and personality variables interacted on the two creative performances . Therefore , Model 4 was constructed and Gender (cid:9) Personality variables were entered as predictors . The results showed no significant moderation effects . Discussion The present study specifies and examines how personality traits and gender are related to different creativity measures : divergent thinking and insight problem solving . These two creativity mea - sures are investigated and applied extensively but independently by the psychometric and cognitive approach in creativity research literature . Our results mainly showed that different personality traits in the HEXACO – PI – R were related to different creativity measures . Our male and female participants performed differently in the two creativity measures . Interesting findings were also obtained when considering the relationships between gender , per - sonality traits , and creativity . The more detailed discussions of these findings are stated as follows . As our data showed ( see Table 2 ) , Openness to Experience and Extraversion correlated significantly to most of the participants’ divergent thinking performances . These results replicated the pre - vious findings in which these two personality traits were identified as being important in creativity , when only the divergent thinking sort of measurement was used ( Batey & Furnham , 2006 ; Batey et al . , 2010 ) . However , Openness to Experience and Extraversion were not so related to close - ended , insight problem solving when we took this measurement into consideration . Instead , individuals who performed better on insight problem solving possessed less Emotionality , as our data showed a negative correlation between Emotionality and insight problem - solving performance .

An interesting finding in the regression analysis ( see Table 4 ) revealed that Openness to Experience also significantly predicted verbal insight problem - solving performance even after intelligence and gender were controlled . Given that Openness to Experience is assumed to be related to the richness of ideas an individual holds and processes ( Batey et al . , 2010 ) , one possible explanation is that some less dominant concepts ( but that are keys to the correct answers ) that lie in the descriptions of our particular verbal insight problems were equally and properly processed as the dominant concepts by individuals with a high level of Openness to Experi - ence ; hence , the likelihood of correct solutions increased . The role of Openness to Experience on insight problem solving still needs further investigation with different problems as measures . Turning to the role of gender , our data showed a pattern of disso - ciation between gender and different creativity measures ( see Table 3 ) . Although women performed better on most of the indexes of divergent thinking test , which was also demonstrated by previous studies ( Dudek et al . , 1993 ; Kim & Michael , 1995 ; Kuhn & Holling , 2009 ) , our data first showed that men were better at an insight problem - solving task . When inspecting the relationships between gender , personality traits , and creativity , our results showed that the predictive powers of gender generally decreased when personality variables were included in the regression analyses , especially for divergent thinking indexes ( see Table 4 ) . Although the moderation effects of gender and personality were not significant , the mediation analyses showed some interesting findings . Women performed better on divergent thinking tasks and are more open to experience than men ( additional analysis that we performed showed a significant correla - tion between gender and Openness to Experience , r (cid:1) . 12 , p (cid:3) . 05 ) . The significant mediation effects of Openness to Experience on the relationships between gender and divergent thinking indexes ( fluency , in particular ) indicated that women possessed a higher level of Open - ness to Experience , which further enhanced their fluency in divergent thinking . There was no significant mediation effect of personality on the relationships between gender and insight problem - solving perfor - mance , although analysis showed that gender and Emotionality were significantly correlated ( r (cid:1) . 21 , p (cid:3) . 01 ) . In addition , Table 4 also showed that the amount of variance explained in insight problem - solving performance did not increase when personality variables were further included in the regression analysis . These results indicate that gender did not predict insight problem - solving performance through Emotionality and personality traits played smaller roles on insight problem solving . Instead , insight problem - solving performance was mainly predicted by intelligence ( APM ) and gender differences . Although the regression weights that were obtained , as shown in Table 4 , were rather low , the present study may provide an exploratory direction . The ways in which gender and personality interact to influence different creativity measures remain an interesting issue that merits further exploration . As previously mentioned , Lin and Lien ( 2011 ) proposed a dual - process account of creativity to explore the differential involvement of Systems 1 and 2 processing in divergent thinking and creative prob - lem solving . In respect to this theory , the present study hypothesizes that different gender and personality traits might influence the ease and choice of the processing mode and , hence , affect divergent thinking or creative problem solving differently on either side ( as we used insight problems as one kind of creative problems ) . Our results support this theory . First , the participants’ performances on the two measures were only slightly correlated , indicating different processes that the two measures might possibly involve . Second , although women have been suggested to be prone to holistic , intuitive , and System 1 thinking , and men have been suggested to be dominated by analytic and System 2 thinking ( Wang , 2011 ) , our results showed that female and male participants performed better at divergent thinking and insight problem solving , respectively . Third , Emotionality , which was hypothesized to hinder analytical , System 2 processing with its high level , was found to be negatively related to insight problem - solving performance . Openness to Experience , which might espe - cially facilitate associative , System 1 processing , was found to be positively related to divergent thinking performance . These results support the notions of dual - process account of creativity ( Lin & Lien , 2011 ) in that the idea generation in divergent thinking mainly relies on associative , intuitive , and effortless System 1 processing . However , generating plausible solutions in creative problem solving additionally requires rule - based , analytical , and resource - limited System 2 pro - cessing . Another interesting issue that requires further discussion is how culture may have played a role in our study on the relationships between gender , personality , and creativities . Our data was collected in Taiwan , but some researchers pointed out that gender differences in creativity ( divergent thinking performance , in particular ) could be best expected in Western cultures ( e . g . , Kuhn & Holling , 2009 ) . As men - tioned , P . C . Cheung and colleagues ( 2004 ) found no gender differ - ences in the fluency index in a Hong Kong sample . Our results showed that Taiwanese women performed better in divergent thinking than men , consistent with the findings in Western culture ( Dudek et al . , 1993 ; Kuhn & Holling , 2009 ) as well as Kim and Michaels’ ( 2005 ) finding on a significant gender difference in creativity in a Korean sample . In addition , although creativity could be hindered by the social structure of the collectivism culture ( Runco , 2007 ) and Openness to Experience could be not encouraged in Chinese society ( McCrae , Yik , Trapnell , Bond , & Paulhus , 1998 ) , we found that Openness to Experience and Extraversion were positively related to divergent thinking . As F . M . Cheung and colleagues ( 2008 ) argued , the construct of openness in Chinese culture should incorporate the idea - or interest - related cognitive styles in Western culture with in - terpersonal potency and Extraversion in the collective culture . Our measures of Openness to Experience and Extraversion could capture the part of the Chinese notion of Openness to Experience . Our results also imply that , even in a detrimental context ( e . g . , collectivism culture ) for creativity , the personal dispositions could enhance one’s creativity . Although many factors may contribute to the real - life achievement of creativity , creativity potentials or abilities ( such as divergent think - ing and creative problem solving ) were considered the essential com - ponents of this achievement ( Eysenck , 1995 ; Sternberg et al . , 2005 ) . The present study that focuses on individuals’ creative potentials might provide some implications for real - world creativity . A scientist discovers the principles of the world according to phenomena and evidence , whereas an artist creates works of art without constraining the work to concrete explanations of objectives ( Simonton , 2008 ; Stent , 2001 ) . Creative problem solving , with its closed - ended prop - erty , could be closer to the scientific discovery processes , whereas divergent thinking tasks might characterize more artistic processes by their open - ended nature ( Lin & Lien , 2011 ) . Previous work has identified some different personality traits that belong to artists and scientists ( Feist , 1999 ) . Our study suggests that Emotionality and 119 GENDER , PERSONALITY TRAITS AND CREATIVENESS T h i s do c u m e n t i s c opy r i gh t e d by t h e A m e r i ca n P s y c ho l og i ca l A ss o c i a ti on o r on e o f it s a lli e d pub li s h e r s .

Openness to Experience might be other traits that could differentiate them with a possible theoretical base ( i . e . , the dual - process account of creativity , Lin & Lien , 2011 ) . Our study also gives support to and a possible explanation concerning the observations that women are more interested in social and artistic events , whereas men are more interested in scientific activities ( Betz & Fitzgerald , 1987 ) . Further , men are better than women at scientific studies ( Ceci , Williams , & Barnett , 2009 ; Martin , Mullis , Gonzalez , & Chrostowski , 2004 ) . If factors are found to be correlated differently with divergent thinking and creative problem solving , they might be used to differentiate individuals with distinct potentials and design for various training programs that are applied to improve different creative achievements .
