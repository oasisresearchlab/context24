Collection of standardized high - quality clinical , epidemiological , virological and serological data in FFX studies can provide insight into transmission dynamics , severity , risk factors for severe disease and the clinical spectrum of disease . These data can be used in risk assessment and modelling studies , to forecast potential impact and guide preparedness planning and public health interventions . Independent studies of coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) , caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) , have provided insights into key transmissibility and severity parameters . 1 Although these studies are valuable in contributing to the growing body of scientific evidence on COVID - 19 epidemiology , there is need for a greater number of harmonized studies ( e . g . FFX studies ) that can be rapidly implemented in early epidemic phases . 2 In early January 2020 , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) adapted and added to existing pandemic influ - enza and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( MERS - CoV ) protocols for COVID - 19 and rebranded them as UNITY studies – a global sero - epidemiological stand - ardization initiative . UNITY protocols aim to increase evidence - based knowledge for action , and are an invalu - able tool for improving equity by providing harmonized and fit - for - purpose protocols for all income and resource settings . 3 UNITY studies allow for timely comparison and aggregate analysis of data across countries and regions , to contextualize data to different settings and offer a depth of understanding that is not readily available using other platforms . WHO solicited interest in implementing these protocols during the COVID - 19 pandemic from partners to address knowledge gaps and inform public health response measures . 4 Despite being in an unprecedented pandemic , many countries were able to leverage existing infrastructure to implement UNITY studies . Insights from participating countries are centrally reported to WHO headquarters and regional offices , and include contribu - tions from 98 WHO Member States ( including Australia , Mongolia , the Philippines and Singapore in the Western Pacific Region ) . 4 , 5 More in - depth understanding of the epidemiology of COVID - 19 gained through such studies can be used to inform adaptive and ongoing control strategies . For example , in early 2020 , a study aligned with FFX and UNITY conducted in China showed that most second - ary cases were probably infected around the time of symptom onset of the primary cases . 6 This highlighted the need for household infection control measures , given that immediate intervention by local health authorities following symptom onset of the primary case is difficult to achieve .

These data will be critical in informing future control measures , particularly with the emergence of new variants and the commencement of vaccination campaigns . For maximum utility , countries should exercise or pilot these studies in advance of future outbreaks – for example , at the beginning of influenza seasons – to facilitate timely implementation during emergencies . Piloting will allow countries to consider data collection and management , laboratory testing and capacity , ethics and governance approvals , identify a suitable workforce and develop workflows in advance of outbreaks , to ensure that they are effective . Piloting should also consider developing scalable , feasible and culturally appropriate methods for collect - ing data and specimens , to improve equity and health outcomes for the vulnerable and those at greater risk of disease . These methods should be developed with communities for communities . 11 Historical evidence shows that previous pandemics have disproportionately impacted First Nations peoples . 12 – 15 Adapting FFX and UNITY studies within a First Nations context can lead to a deeper understanding of the experience of families , explore household transmission in different types of households and improve understanding of how studies can be operationalized to inform culturally appropriate and safe disease control strategies . FFX studies and the broader suite of UNITY stud - ies remain incredibly useful in the current regional and global context , and they could provide ongoing robust and comparable evidence of COVID - 19 epidemiology in low - and middle - income countries as the pandemic evolves . Investing in UNITY studies , readiness and preparedness planning will better support the ongoing COVID - 19 re - sponse and help to ensure research equity and improve capacity to respond rapidly to future emerging pathogens . ( United Kingdom ) established a sensitive and specific symptom profile of COVID - 19 , including the reporting of anosmia in patients . This symptom was later added to the United Kingdom’s COVID - 19 symptom list . 7 There is also continuing uncertainty about the role of children in spreading COVID - 19 and the extent of true asymptomatic and pre - symptomatic transmission . Although the spread appears to be influenced by social settings and household structures , public health interventions ( e . g . test , trace and isolate ; spontaneous and imposed behavioural and distancing measures and mobility restrictions ; communi - cation campaigns ; and varying degrees of community en - gagement and cohesion in response ) have led to differing rates of transmission within and between countries . FFX studies can provide opportunities to explore transmis - sion dynamics and severity during all epidemic phases , provided that contacts of cases can still be traced . FFX and other UNITY studies are well placed to provide information on SARS - CoV - 2 variants such as alpha , beta and delta , which are marked by different biological characteristics to those previously observed in epidemiological studies . 8 Pooling of data from FFX stud - ies may help us to understand how SARS - CoV - 2 could behave in the Western Pacific , particularly in settings that have not yet experienced uncontrolled epidemics and in populations with low vaccination coverage or low levels of natural immunity . Areas with limited resources to conduct intensive surveillance studies would benefit from globally standardized data collection and analysis to assist with more nuanced planning for future outbreaks . FFX studies provide a platform to compare epidemi - ology between waves and jurisdictions and can be used to inform targeted and context - specific public health interventions . For example , Australia and Singapore – countries in the Western Pacific – experienced subsequent waves of epidemic activity that exhibited different epide - miological patterns to earlier waves . The first wave in Australia predominantly featured cases acquired overseas or their close contacts , whereas the second wave was amplified in aged - care and health - care setting outbreaks that led to community transmission . 9 Singapore’s initial epidemic was characterized by outbreaks in migrant workers residing in dormitories , with low - level commu - nity transmission . In late 2021 , Singapore experienced an epidemic wave of the delta variant with widespread com - munity transmission . 10 In both settings , culturally and WPSAR Vol 13 , No 1 , 2022 | doi : 10 . 5365 / wpsar . 2022 . 13 . 1 . 873 https : / / ojs . wpro . who . int / 3 FFX studies for COVID - 19 Marcato et al 5 .
