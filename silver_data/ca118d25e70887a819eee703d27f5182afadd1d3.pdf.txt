Althoughexpressedatverylowlevelsinmosttissues , folatereceptors , especiallyFR a , areexpressedathighlevelsinnumer - ous cancers tomeet thefolatedemandof rapidly dividingcells under lowfolateconditions 1 – 3 . Thefolatedependencyofmanytumourshas been therapeuticallyanddiagnosticallyexploited byadministration ofanti - FR a antibodies , high - affinityantifolates 4 , 5 , folate - basedimaging agents and folate - conjugated drugs and toxins 6 – 8 . To understand howfolatebindsitsreceptors , wedeterminedthecrystalstructureof human FR a in complexwith folic acidat 2 . 8A˚ resolution . FR a hasa globularstructurestabilizedbyeightdisulphidebondsandcontainsadeepopenfolate - binding pocket comprised of residues that are conservedinallreceptorsubtypes . Thefolatepteroatemoietyisburied inside the receptor , whereas its glutamate moiety is solvent - exposed andsticksoutof the pocket entrance , allowing it to be conjugated to drugs without adversely affecting FR a binding . The extensive inter - actions between the receptor and ligand readily explain the high folate - binding affinity of folate receptors and provide a template fordesigning morespecificdrugs targetingthe folatereceptorsystem . Folates ( vitamin B 9 ) are important one - carbon donors for the syn - thesis of purines and thymidine—essential components of nucleic acids—and indirectly , via S - adenosyl methionine , for methylation of DNA , proteins and lipids 9 . Folate deficiency is therefore associated with many diseases , including fetal neural tube defects , cardiovascular disease and cancers 10 . In adult tissues , folate is mainly taken up by reduced folate carrier , a ubiquitously expressed anion channel that has relatively low folate - binding affinity ( K m 5 1 – 10 m M ) 11 . By contrast , high - affinity uptake of the food supplement folic acid ( K d , 1 nM ) 12 and the physiologically prevalent folate N 5 - methyltetrahydrofolate ( 5 - mTHF ) requires the function of three subtypes of folate receptor ( FR a , FR b and FR c ) , which are cysteine - rich glycoproteins that mediate folate uptake through endocytosis . Inside of the cell , the acidic envir - onmentof theendosome promotes therelease of folatefromreceptors , which is then transported into the cytoplasm by proton - coupled folate transporter 13 . The expression of folate receptors is largely restricted to cells important for embryonic development ( for example , placenta and neural tubes ) and folate resorption ( kidney ) . Among the three FR isoforms , FR a is the most widely expressed , with very low levels in normal tissues , but high expression levels in many tumours 14 .

Despite intense research on the folate structure – activity relationship , the molecular basis for the high - affinity recognition of folates by FR a remains elusive owing to the technical difficulties in expression , purification and crystallization of FR a for structural studies . To obtain FR a protein for structural studies , we stably expressed human FR a lacking its carboxy - terminal glycophosphatidylinositol anchor as a secreted IgG Fc fusion protein ( FR a – Fc ) in HEK293 cells . As fully glycosylated fusion protein purified from culture medium yieldedpoorlydiffractingcrystals , wereducedcrystallization - inhibiting glycosylation heterogeneity by combined treatment with kifunensine and endoglycosidase H , which together reduce complex carbohydr - ates to single N - acetylglucosamine ( NAG ) moieties 15 ( Supplementary Fig . 1a , b ) . The deglycosylated FR a – Fc had a similar folic acid - binding affinity ( , 190pM ) to the fully glycosylated protein ( Supplementary Fig . 1d ) and yielded crystals , which diffracted to 2 . 8 A ˚ ( Supplementary Fig . 1c ) . We solved the structure by combining the phase information from one Pt derivative and six native S anomalous data sets ( see Methods and Supplementary Table 1 ) . FR a has an overall globularstructure , comprisingfour long a - helices ( a 1 , a 2 , a 3 , a 6 ) , two short a - helices ( a 4 , a 5 ) , four short b - strands ( b 1 – b 4 ) and many loop regions ( Fig . 1a , b ) . The tertiary structure is greatly stabilized by eight disulphide bonds formed by 16 conserved cysteine residues ( C15 – C43 , C35 – C83 , C44 – C87 , C67 – C153 , C74 – C124 , C113 – C187 , C117 – C167 and C130 – C147 ) . FR a has three pre - dicted N - glycosylation sites at N47 , N139 and N179 . Clear electron density for NAG is observed for N47 and N139 , and partial electron density for N179 . The overallfoldof FR a is similar to that of riboflavin - binding protein ( 22 % sequence identity to FR a ) 16 , with a root mean squareddeviation of1 . 56A˚ for 163C a atoms , but thetwoproteinshave very differently shaped ligand pockets and ligand - binding modes ( Sup - plementary Fig . 2 ) . The core domain consists of helices a 1 , a 2 , a 3 and a 5 tied together byfourdisulphidebridges ( C35 – C83 , C44 – C87 , C74 – C124andC117 – C167 ; Fig . 1a ) . The structure of FR a contains a long and open folate - binding pocket , which is formed by a 1 , a 2 and a 3 in the back ; the amino - terminal loop , b 1 and b 2 in the bottom ; the a 1 – a 2 and a 3 – a 4 loops in the left and top ; and a 4 , a 5 , b 4 and b 3 in the right ( Fig . 1a , b ) . Folic acid is oriented with its basic pteroate moiety docked deep inside ofthenegativelychargedpocketandthetwonegativelychargedcarboxyl groups of its glutamate moiety sticking out of the positively charged b S174 H135 K136 Y60 W140 Y175 D81 R103 a D81 R103 R106 H135 c Y175 Y85 W171 D81 H135 S174 R103 R106 D81 S174 H135 R103 R106 W171 Y175 Y85 K136 W102 W140 W138 G137 Y60 K136 W140 W138 G137 F62 H135 W102 Figure 2 | Structural and biochemical analysis of FR a – folic acid interactions . a , The s A - weighted 2 F o – F c electron density map for folic acid , shownasagreymesh . b , Theinternalchargedistributionsurfaceofthebinding pocket is shown using the same colour code as in Fig . 1c , with folic acid shown in stick presentation . c , Folic acid - binding network with close - ups of the folic acid head and tail groups .

Clear electron density was observed for folic acid and the surround - ing amino acid residues , which allowed for accurate modelling of the ligand and its interacting residues lining the binding pocket ( Fig . 2a and Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . The cross - section of the binding pocket reveals the complementary shape and charge between the bound ligand and the receptor ( Fig . 2b ) . Folic acid docks into an extended groove of FR a in the direction roughly perpendicular to the plane formed by helices a 1 , a 2 and a 3 , with the pterin head group buried insideagainst thebackformedby a 1 , a 2 and a 3 ( Figs1aand 2b , c ) . The interactions around the pteroate moiety contain both hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions . First , the pterin ring is stacked between theparallelsidechainsofY85andW171 , andcappedbyY175 ( Fig . 2c ) . Second , the hydrophilic pterin ring N and O atoms form a series of hydrogen bonds with receptor residues . Specifically , the pterin N1 and N2 atoms form strong hydrogen bonds with the side - chain carboxyl group of D81 , the N3 and O4 atoms with the S174 hydroxyl group , the O4 atom forms two hydrogen bonds with the guanidinium groups of R103 and R106 , and the N5 atom forms one hydrogen bond with the H135sidechain ( Figs2cand3a ) . Interestingly , folicacidO4isreplaced by an amino group in the antifolates methotrexate and aminopterin , which have reduced affinity for FR a 5 , 17 . The amino group would not allow for the formation of hydrogen bonds with R103 and R106 and would sterically clash with the position of R103 ( see Fig . 3a ) in the folic acid - bound structure , providing a structural rationale for the poor FR a - binding of these two compounds and their preferential uptake by reduced folate carrier . The folic acid aminobenzoate is stabilized by hydrophobic interac - tionswithY60 , W102andW134 , whichlinethemiddleofthelongligand - binding pocket ( Fig . 3a ) . Extensive interactions are also observed for the glutamate group , which engages six hydrogen bonds , contributed by the side chains of W102 , K136 and W140 , as well as by backbone interactions with H135 , G137 and W138 ( Figs 2c and 3a ) . Most resi - dues involved in ligand binding are identical among different subtypes of FR regardless of their origins ( Supplementary Figs 4 and 5 ) , indi - cating that the observed folate - binding interactions are probably con - served in all three different receptor subtypes . In addition , the most physiologicallyprevalentfolate , 5 - mTHF , canbeeasilydockedintothe FR a ligand - binding pocket in a mode very similar to that of folic acid , suggesting that the fundamental mechanism of folate recognition is conserved ( Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . To validate the structure observations , we examined the ligand - binding affinities of FR a mutants that have alanine mutations in the key folate - contacting residues . The W171A mutation abolished the expression of the receptor ( Supplementary Fig . 7a ) , suggesting that this residue is critical for protein stability . All other mutants expressed relatively well and were purified to determine their folate - binding affinity by radioligand - binding assay ( Supplementary Figs 7b and 8b ) . Whereas wild - type FR a bound to [ 3 H ] - folic acid with a K d of , 0 . 19 nM , replacement of D81 decreased affinity by more than one orderofmagnitude , consistentwiththestronginteractionoftheaspar - tate carboxyl oxygens with the pterin N1 and N2 nitrogens , and indi - cating that this interaction is a key contributor to high - affinity ligand binding . By contrast , mutations of Y175 , K136 and R106 ( bond lengths $ 3 . 1A˚ ) have little effect , and mutations of all other ligand - binding residues ( hydrogen bonds # 3 . 0A ˚ ) have only moderate effects onfolicacidbinding ( affinitydeceasesof # 3 . 6 - fold ) , whichareapproxi - mately additive for the double mutants R103A / S174A and W102A / R103A . This extensive interaction network therefore makes FR a – folic acid binding remarkably resistant to single amino acid substitutions ( Fig . 3b and Supplementary Figs 7b and 8b ) . Together , the structural and mutational analyses present a structural rationale for the absolute requirement of the pterin group for anchoring folate in the binding pocket of the receptor and for the availability of the glutamate group for conjugation with drugs and imaging reagents 18 , without adversely affecting the interactions between receptor and ligand . In summary , many cancers highly express FR a , which has therefore become an important target for receptor - mediated chemotherapy . How FR binds to folate and folate - conjugated drugs , however , has remained unknown . The FR a – folic acid complex structure illustrates how the receptor assumes a deep folate - binding pocket that is formed byconservedresiduesacrossallreceptorsubtypesandprovidesdetailedinsightsintohowfolicacidinteractswithitsreceptors . Together , these observationsestablisharationalfoundationfordesigningspecificdrugstargetingthefolatereceptorsystem .

The human FR a ( residues 23 – 234 ) com - plementaryDNAexcludingthesecretionsignalpeptide ( residues1 – 22 ) andglyco - phosphatidylinositol anchor signal peptide ( residue 235 – 257 ) was expressed as a human IgG Fc fusion protein from the expression vector pcDNA6 . This construct also contained a murine Ig k leader sequence at the N terminus to allow target protein secretion into media supernatant , a thrombin cleavage site between FR a and Fc , and a His 6 tag after the Fc tag .

Datacollectionwasperformedatsector21 - ID - D ( LS - CAT ) ofthe APS synchrotron using single native crystals and the diffraction data were pro - cessed with HKL2000 ( ref . 23 ) . On the basis of Matthew’s coefficient calculation , thecrystalshaveanunusuallylargeunitcellwithanestimateof8 – 10moleculesper asymmetric unit . Initial structure determination by molecular replacement using riboflavin - binding protein ( which shares 22 % sequence identity with FR a ) as a search model failed to yield any correct solution . To solve the phase problem , a heavy - atom derivative was prepared by soaking the native FR a crystals with a Pt salt before data collection . Also , six data sets of native FR a were collected at a wavelength of 1 . 77A˚ to measure the S anomalous signal to aid in structure deter - mination . These six data sets were processed using XDS 24 , combined using Pointless , and merged using Scala of the CCP4 suite 25 as previously described 26 . Merging multiple data sets increased the S anomalous signal and redundancy of the data , but also led to an increase of the merging R - factor 26 . Initial phases were established by using the SHELX program 19 with Pt - soaked derivative data and native data ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . Fifteen Pt atoms were found by SHELXD withaCC / CC weak scoreof31 . 4 / 17 . 1 ( CCisthecorrelationcoefficientbetween E calc and E obs foralldata andCC weak isthecorrelation coefficient for30 % of reflections that were not used during the dual - space refinement ) . Subsequent phasing using SHELXE generated a contrast score of 0 . 8 and connectivity of 0 . 79 for the correct hand solution . Density modification for the initial electron density map was performed using DM 20 . A crude model was built automatically using the CCP4 program buccaneer and improved by manual building using Coot 21 . Phases were further improved by using the S anomalous data and a total of 29 S atoms were foundbasedontheanomalousdifferenceFourierusingthePhenixprogram 27 . The initial FR a model was manually adjusted on the basis of the electron density map using the riboflavin - binding protein structure as a reference and the improved model allowed accurate location of eight molecules in one asymmetric unit by molecular replacement ( Supplementary Fig . 9 ) . The models were refined against the nativedatawitheight - foldnon - crystallographicsymmetryrestraintsusingthe Refmac program of CCP4 ( ref . 22 ) . The densities for folic acid became clear after severalroundsofmodeladjustmentsandrefinementsandeightmoleculesoffolatewerebuiltintothemodel . The final model was refined to an R factor of 0 . 206 and an R free factorof 0 . 256 ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . The Ramachandran statistics are 87 % in the favoured regions , 12 . 5 % in additional allowed regions and 0 . 5 % in generously allowed regions . Mutagenesis . Site - directed mutagenesis was carried out using the QuickChange method ( Stratagene ) . Mutations and all plasmid constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing . Radioligand - binding assay . The binding affinity of each FR a mutant was deter - mined by saturation radioligand - binding assay . 40nM of each mutant in 100 m l binding buffer ( 25mM Tris , pH8 . 0 , 150mM NaCl , 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 ) was immobilized in the wells of a protein G - coated 96 - well plate ( Thermo Scientific ) for 40min . Endogenous ligand was stripped with 100 m l stripping buffer ( 25mM acetate acid , pH3 . 5 , 150mM NaCl , 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 ) for 1min as described previously 28 . After neutralizing and washing with 200 m l binding buffer , proteins were incubated for 40min with 100 m l binding buffer supplemented with the indicated concentrations of [ 3 H ] - folic acid ( Moravek Biochemicals ) . FR a - bound [ 3 H ] - folic acid was determined by scintillation counting following removal of unbound ligand by two 100 - m l washes with binding buffer . K d was determined by nonlinear regression using GraphPad Prism . 23 . Otwinowski , Z . & Minor , W . in MethodsinEnzymology Vol . 276 ( edsCarter , C . W . Jr . & Sweet , R .
