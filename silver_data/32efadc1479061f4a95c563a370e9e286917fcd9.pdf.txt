Historiographs , Librarianship and the History of Science by Eugene Garfield Instif ufe j _ or Scien ti ~ ic Irs ~ ormation 325 Chestnut Street Philadelphia , Pa 19106 The study of the history of science has recently taken on new importance as an academic discipline . It’s easy to see why . With the pace and complexity of scientific developments accelerating , the need for improved guidelines for scientific research becomes more ob - vious each day . As critical as today’s dilemmas of pesticides , pollution , and nuclear weapons are , applications of current scientific research could pro - duce far more serious problems in the future . For example , the work of mo - lecular biologists could produce a hap - pier , healthier world population or , as suggested by some , it could produce some horrible new weapon of war . 1 Guidelines for scientific research , however , do not simply materialize from thin air . A solid understanding of past developments and the present na - ture of science itself is required fust . Professor Derek de Solla Price claim % “we are getting to the point where there must arise a fairly hard academic discipline to help understand the ma - chinery that makes science act the way it does and grow the way it grows . ’ ‘z By studying the history of science in a more intensive and accurate fash - ion , we may obtain badly needed in - sight into such problems as : a The role of science in war and peace . b . The use and misuse of research . c . The inter - relations of science and technology . d The reciprocal responsibilities of scientists and society . e , The funding and control of science . f . The determination of future policies on scientific education . g . The formulation of a public policy on science in general . With such important questions to be answered , writing the history of science can no longer be looked on as an ex - ercise to satisfy one’s curiosity . This endeavor is too important to be ful - filled , as it has been in the past , as an avocation of scientists . What is neede ~ as in any other complex activity , is a highly trained specialist . There have been some beginnings towards this objective . hr I ! ) 50 there were only a handful of professional science historians in North America , 136 and few sch00Is offered doctoral ore grams . Today we can count at Last 500 scholars in the field , while at least 25 maior universities offer de - gree program ; in the history of science . Probably the f ~ st full - time historian of science “was George Sarton of Har - vard who founded h - is , the chief jour - nal of the field . In his early work , Sarton was primarily concerned with precise chronological reconstructions of events . In his subsequent work , he used more of a narrativ ~ approach and began to analyze and interpret cause and effect relationships . Later , Alex - andre Koyr ~ of Print - eton attempted to explain the development of a new scientific concept by examining the work of the scientist against the pre - vailing philosophical and intellectual assumptions of his time . Koyr6 , how - ever , did not regard a scientist’s outer social milieu as an important factor in shaping his work . More recently , his - torians of science have begun to stress the relationship between new ideas and the outer social order in which they develop . a Whatever the approach , the historian of science will produce useful results . only in direct proportion to the investi - gative and evaluative tools at his dis - posal . The difficulty of amassing the facts of history is well known . Much human error is injected on the part of the historian despite his dedication and rigorous standards . Even with an event like the assassination of President Kennedy , which was observed by count - less uersons , there still remains doubt , as to precisely what occurred . Writing the history of science has its own par - ticular difficulties . The motivation and evolution of ideas are frequently omit - ted from scientific writings . Usually , major achievements in Wience are easily recognized ; minor or less heralded con - tributions are difficult to identify and are often overlooked Even rela ~ ively irrmortant events rnav be missed in the , J plethora of data to be evaluated . It is . not surprising , therefore , that there are alwavs numerous uncertaintiess in / writing even a fragment of the history of science . Historiographs A ne - w tool that tmomises to belts the historian of scien ~ e out of this pr ; dicament is the “historiograph , ” a term coined by the Institute - for Scien - tifm Information to describe a graphic display of citation & ta that shows key scient ~ lc events , their chronology , their inter - relationships , and their relative importance . Although the technical feasibility of this tool has been estab - lished , a ~ d a good portion of the re - quired citation & ta base is available , much work remains to acquaint the historian of science with its availability / and its applications . I feel that this is a role that is most properly filled by the librarian . I also feel that if librarians take advantage of this opportunity , they will be actively participating in a field of growing social significance and will have taken one more step towards achieving the dynamic professional image they desire . As early as 1922 E . Wyndham Hulme used the term “statistical bib - liography” in his lectures at the Unk ver ~ ity of Cambridge . Hsdme used the term to describe the process of il - luminating the history of science and technology by counting documents . In later year % Pritchard used the word “bibliometrics” to describe the quanti - tative asxdvsis of citations . Russian historians o ; science have su ~ ested the use of the term “scientom ~ trics” for this type of study , h 137 Key : Rabinowitch . 1941 6 . Lawley . 1956 . 11 .

Gordon Allen triggered the activities that led to the development of the hiatoriograph . In a private communication to me in 1960 , Dr . Allen diigrammed the relationships be - tween the citations of a bibliography on the staining of nucleic acid as shown in Figure 1 . Although Dr . Allen did not chink of this diagram in the context of a historical tool , my exam - ination of it lead me to form the hy - pothesis that , in most case % a network diagram of citation relationships would in fact , constitute a fairly reliable “out - Bibliography on Staining Nucleic Acid . line” for writing the history of a field of science . This belief was further re - inforced in @ cussions with Berna ~ S Price , G Leake , T and Shryock . 8 I then published an article in A mericms ~ s + merstutim9 in 1963 which summarized my thoughts on the subject and pro - posed some specWlc applications . Testing the validity of Historiographs In 1964 , the Institute for ScientifK Information began work on Air Force Office of Scientifw Research Contract AF49 ( 638 ) - 1256 to verify whether ci - tation data areuseful heuristic tools for the historian . 1 o Essentially , the plan 138 of the study was to construct two net - work diagrams of the history of a field of scienc ~ : one based on the “traditional historical account , and one based on a reconstruction of the same history by using citation relationships . If the’ two diagrams coincided to any signflcant degree , it could be concluded that ci - tation data was , in fact , useful in writ - ing the history of science , To conduct the study it was neces - sary to select a recent important scien - tific break - through which was based on the cumulation of years of diverse scientflc achievement . The dkcovery of the DNA code was selected as this event . The basis for this choice was : ( 1 ) the publication in 1963 of Dr . Isaac Asimov’s book . The Genetic Co & . 11 which describes the major scientific & velopments that led to the laboratory duplic ~ tion of the process of protein synthesis under control of DNA , and ( 2 ) the availability of the Genetics Cita - tion kdex and the 1961 Science Cita - tion Index e to provide the required citation data . In our study , Dr . Asimov’s book was construed as the historian’s account of the discovery of the DNA code . The CXX and the SC1o provided most of the data by which we would attempt to construct a history of the same top ; c by other than expository accounts . To construct the two historiographs , w Proceeded as follows : fist we care - fully identified the specii3c papers in - volved in the discoveries described by Asimov in his history of DNA . These included events explicitly named by Asirnov , as weu as events not explicitly named but easily identtiled by his men - tion of such things as date or place of investigation . Forty key events ( called nodes ) were identified ( 36 explicit , 4 implied ) which spanned a period of about 140 years ( 1820 to 1962 ) . The 40 nodes were then plotted chronol ~ gically and grouped in broad subject classifications such as nucleic acid chem - istry , protein chemistry , genetics , and microbiology . Asimov’s book was then examined to determine the historical relationships between these 40 nodes . The explicit and implicit relationships were then diagramed as shown in Fig - ure 2 . An extensive literature search was then conducted to identify the specifii published works related to each node described by Asimov . The strictest criteria were adopted to insure that the reference citations chosen were the ones which most definitely correspond - ed to the discovery in question . It turned out that 17 of the 40 nodes re - presented more than one paper . Thus 65 articles were required to cover the 40 nodes . The bibliography of each node ar - ticle was examined to determine the connections between it and other node articles . The 40 nodes were then re - & awn in exactly the same positions and lines drawn to show the d ~ ect and indirect citation connections as shown in Figure 3 . Finally , the two diagrams were superimposed and the degree of coincidence determined . Figure 4 is a summary of the relationships observed from the superimposition of the two dugrams . From this comparison it was de - termined that : ( a ) enough of the net - work diagrams were coincident so that it could be concluded that citation data could be used to develop the his - tory of a field ; and ( b ) significant new relationships between nodes were iden - tified by citation linkages which did not coincide with Asimov’s linkages . 139 mR % ! s Smctf , ed C“nnec ( , c , ” 1111181 Impl , ed Conoec I , cm Figure 2 .

The gra - phic displays of the history made it easier and quicker to grasp the total flow of the developmentof the field . Further , they made it possible to tie - in seemingly unrelated events . It was at this point that we became convinced that the historiograph would be a boon to the historian . Need for Automatic Diagraming It soon became obvious , however , that the manual production of historio - graphs would severely limit the usefid - ness of this tool . As the number of nodes increased in a history , it soon became almost physically impossible to draw all the connecting lines , Also , as the lines increased , the clarity of the diagram & creased . In 1967 1S1o began an investiga - tion of the problem of the automatic drawing of network diagrams contain - ing nodes with many interconnections .

Routing systemaal - 4’ $ The investigation of previous work uncovered no method that satisfied all specified criteria . Even if all other cr - iteria were met , the dkplays became inordinately complicated when more than 10 nodes were involved . It was then felt that the solution to this pr ~ blem was in developing a unique way 141 I 8 1 ‘n 10 SSSSSSSDirect or Stfonglv Implmd Cnatoon wsmtaI nd , rect C8t . 31 ton Figure 3 . Direct and Indirect Citation Relationships in the History of DNA 142 of ordering nodes and / or interconnect - ing lines . Some of the display formats evaluated and rejected included : a . Linear Array ( see Figure 5 ) b . Cascade Display ( see Figure 6 ) c . Waterfall Display ( see Figure 7 ) d . Rectangular - Node Cascade Display ( see Figure 8 ) e . Fountain D ~ play ( see Figure 9 ) Diagonal Display Finally , the concept of “Diagonal Display” was evolved and refined . aS , aG As shown in Figure 10 , Diagonal Dis - play involves arranging the no & s on a diagonal with interconnections shown by lines in the areas adjacent to the nodes . In this original conceptual draw - ing , the dots indicate a connection be - tween nodes . Since the Diagonal Display concept had been entirely handdrawn up to this poinL it was now necessary to determine how this type of plot could be drawn automatically . The fwst at - temrws involved the use of a standard com ~ uter printer . Although this was quite satisfactory for many applica - tions , it was felt that even the addition of special characters to the printer vmuld not give the printout the over - all visual claritv desired . With partic ~ lar concern for improv - ing the clarity of line junctions and crossover % we then considered several other types of output devices . Included in these were : a . Electric lamp display b . Cathode ray tube ( CRT ) direct dis - play c . CRT plotter d . Incremental pen plotter It soon became obvious that al - though each device could be used in the system , the best choice for the type of printout desired would be an incremental pen plotter . Typically , with such a device , digital signals cause the pen to move in increments in linear directions to any point on a sheet of paper . By drawing very smal ~ consecu - tive increments , the pen can also pro - duce curved lines . A number of commercially available incremental pen plotters were con - sidered , and a CalComp 563 was selec - ted as the most suitable . An appropri - ate program was written and several variations of the basic Diagonal Di . + play format shown in Figure 10 were & veloped , with the most significant mod $ lcations being the way connec - tions and crossovers of lines were handled . Most improvements in the selected display format involved the use of gaps in vertical lines to irdcate crossovers , rounded elbows to show connections , and the addition of num - bers at each elbow to show what nodes were connected at that point . A printout was generated for the 40 nodes contained in the previously dis - cussed history of the genetic code . This printout is shown in Figure 11 . A comparison of Figure 11 with Figure 3 ( the hand - drawn network of the DNA history ) will make obvious the in - creased clarity provided by the auto matic Diagonal Display . Another test was conducted to pr - duce a printout for a network with 80 nodes . It was concluded that this was as visually clear as the 40 - node print - out . In fact , it is now felt that even printouts containing 250 nodes would be equally clear . To summarize all this , ISI’s work has shown : 1 . That citation relationships can be of great use in writing the history of a field of science . 143 1960 1955 1950 1940 1930 1900 1820 r / 1 ) . . . . . . .

That a graphic representation ( hb toriograph ) helps to clarify the re - lationships and give a quick , over - all view of the development of the field . 3 . That relatively large - scale histori ~ graphs can be automatically pro - duced on a practical basis . Applications Manuafly or automatically drawn historiogtaphs can be used to advan - tage by the historian of science to : a . Reduce a large number of seemingly unrelated events to a coherent pat - tern . b . Identify classic papers . c . Identify break - through events with - in the development of a field . d . Identify the descendant of a de - velopment . e . Keep track of how often an event influences later events . Con texts By removing the vagaries of manual drawing , however , ausomatically pro - duced historiographs provide addition - al depth of analysis . For example , be - cause similar relationships will be con - sistently displayed in the same way , cer - tain types of pattern analyses can be performed . The similarities or differen - ces between the historiograph patterns of one field and those of another could lead to meaningful insights . This type of comparison could also apply to his - toriographs generated for sub - fields of a larger area of scientific endeavor . Pat - tern analysis could also be used to iden - tify unusual chronological spacing be - tween events and to determine how fields of science coalesce or fragment . Automatic manipulation also makes it easy to emphasize or leave out certain events in a given history . The historian can then determine if there were alter - nate paths to subsequent discoveries Role of the Librarian At this point , the librarian may legiti - mately ask , “What has all this to do with me ? of what use will historiographs be to me in my work ? Where do I fit in ? ” Librarians should look on historio graphs as tools that rightfully belong in their domain . Just as much as an index isa retrieval tool , so too is the histotio - graph . For example , what better way could there be for the librarian to Se ] ect key papers for a newcomer to a field to read than by examining a pertinent historiograph ? In the not too distant future I can envision a historian of science requesting information from the library on a specific development . The librarian will then , as he does now , compile an appropriate bibliography by manual or automatic means . How - ~ ever , another step will then take place that will add a new level of importance to the assistance a researcher can ex - pect from a librarian . The librarian will then sit at a computer console ( or some similar device ) and use the bib - liography as input data . He will ask the computer to print out or display all or part of the citation relationships exist - ing in the input bibliography . The li - Ibrarian will then assist the researcher in identifying key papers or obscure but ~ important papers . The value of this type of service , especially with lengthy bibliographies , is self - evident . Another important contribution that could be made by a librarian with a historiograph to analyze , would be the identiflcation of a key paper from an - other field that had an impact on the field of interest . With experience , the librarian might also become skillful at recognizing certain “classic” h“ ~ torio - graph patterns . perhaps then , he will be able to help the historian identify the 1signs of declining or emerging disci - plines . 146 0 !

Printout of Computer Generated Diagonal Display 147 The types of analyses described above can be performed by using histori ~ graphs generated from citation data currently contained in the Sciertce Ci - tation Index . [ n the near future , 1S1 will publish , for the first time , the Jour - nal Citation Index . a 7 The JCI will be a statistical compilation that shows how often other journals cite each of over 2000 journals , The JCZ will also show how often these 2000 journals cite any of over 25 , 000 other journals . With this type of data base available , it will be possible to draw historiographs that show relationships between journals rather than individual papers . l % is , in turn , will permit several additional types of analyses to be made . For example , it would be possible to show the emergence and growth of a field of science by tracing the history of iournals in that field , To do this , a . number of journals could be used as nodes in a network . The nodes would be arranged chronologically according to when volume 1 of each particular journal appeared . The citation patterns between the journals over the years could then be drawn and the relation - ships observed . With this kind of dis - play it would be possible to trace , in terms of journal development , how sci - entific fields branched out from older existing fields . You could literally tell which journals were the “parents” of other journals . Besides being an aid in writing the histo ~ of science , this would also be a useful tool for library science researchers . Another use for network diagrams made from ] Ournal Citati”on zna % x data would be to determine what disciplines make up ascientific field . For example , you could start with certain hard - core genetics journals ( such as The A mericun Journal of Human Genetics , Annals of Human Genetics , and Genetics ) and have them represented as a kind of bulls - eye node in the center of a net - work diagram . Then , you could repre - sent other journals which cite these journals or are cited by these journals as other nodes in the diagram . Those journals that had the highest number of inter - citations with the core journals % the dia - would be positioned closest gram bulls - eye . Those with a lesser number of inter - citations would be placed proportionately further away . Thus , with one diagram , you could get a quick , clear picture of all the disci - plines involved in genetics and the ex - tent of their involvement . Not only would this be a help to the historian of science , it would help the librarian in such things as advising the head of a science department on what journals he should receive . There is no need to emphasize the beneficial effect the ability to give such service will have on the professional status of librarians as a group . A Project for Students In conclusion , I would like to pro - pose a project that would be quite ap - propriate for library school students . AI1the preceding discussion of historio - graphs and other types of network d ~ a - grams presupposes the existence of large - scale citation indexes to provide the data necessary to draw the histono - graphs . 1S1has produced such indexes for all but two years of the 1960’s and work is now in progress so that cita - tion indexes for the missing years ( 1962 and 1963 ) will be available by the end of 1971 . Our goal is to produce total ci - tation index coverage for the literature of the 20th century , and steps are being taken in this direction . 148 1S1 would like to establish a similar goal for the literature of the 19th cen - tury . In particular , we would like to start this project by creating citation in - dexes for the rather limited American scientific literature of that period . Un - fortunately , 19th - century scientific au - thors had very poor citation prac - tices - very few explicit citations were made , although implicit citations were common . Thus . before 1S1’s citation rndexing techniques could be applied , explicit citations would have to be created from the implicit onea . It is the work of creating these explicit cita - tions that I suggest be taken on by li - brary students . The value of this information to historians of science , and perhaps to civilization , would begin to approach the magnitude of the respect we all have for lesse Shera . att NOTES AND REFERENCES 1 .
