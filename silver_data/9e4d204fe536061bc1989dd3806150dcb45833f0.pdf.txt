61 Many eukaryotic signal transduction proteins have component - based architectures : they are built from combinations of protein interaction domains and catalytic domains . Intact , these proteins display the sophisticated allosteric behavior required for cellular regulation ; the protein’s output activity is tightly repressed under basal conditions , but can be robustly activated by a specific set of input effector ligands . A combination of structural , biophysical and computational studies is beginning to shed light on the fundamental principles governing this type of modular allostery .

These individual proteins , when assembled into interacting networks , yield the sophisticated circuits that control cellular behavior . What are the general principles governing the structure and function of signaling proteins ? In eukaryotes , many of these proteins appear to have a component - based architecture : they are built from multiple modular domains , some of which are catalytic ( e . g . kinases and phosphatases ) , but the majority of which mediate protein – protein or protein – lipid interactions [ 1 , 2 ] . A comparison of metazoan genomes suggests that these domains have been extensively recombined and shuffled during evolution . The human genome has essentially the same number of types of individual modular protein domains as the worm and fly ; however , almost twice the number of multidomain combinations ( occurrences in the same polypeptide ) are found in human proteins [ 3 ] . Thus , the fundamental modular domain toolkit , despite changing little since the evolution of the roundworm , appears to have been used in a combinatorial fashion to increase phenotypic complexity . Although much is known about the structure and mechanism of individual signaling domains , our understanding of how these simple modules are used in combination to build complex switches lags far behind . This review will therefore focus on the mechanism of ‘modular allosteric switches’ : multidomain proteins with a core output activity that , although efficiently repressed under basal conditions , is robustly activated by a specific set of input ligands . We would like to understand how these domains are assembled to yield sophisticated switch behavior , analogous to the way in which an electrical engineer can describe how simple tran - sistors are used to fabricate the electronic AND , OR and NOT logic gates that form the backbone of digital control circuits . Modular allosteric switches We will focus on three example switch proteins in order to understand how their modular architecture mediates repression , activation and , in some cases , sophisticated integration of multiple inputs . There are many other related switch proteins that space limitations preclude discussion of here . The functional input / output properties of the example proteins are summarized in Table 1 and their modular architectures are shown in Figure 1 . Src family kinases Src family proteins are tightly regulated tyrosine kinases that contain a catalytic kinase domain and two N - terminal interaction domains : a Src homology 2 ( SH2 ) and a Src homology 3 ( SH3 ) domain ( Figure 1a ; [ 4 – 6 ] ) . SH2 domains bind specific phosphotyrosine motifs , whereas SH3 domains bind specific proline - rich motifs [ 7 – 9 ] . The C terminus of the protein contains a specific tyrosine motif that , under basal conditions , when Src kinases are inactive , is phosphorylated by the C - terminal Src kinase ( Csk ) . Src kinases , however , can be activated by several inputs : SH2 or SH3 ligands , or dephosphorylation of the C - terminal tyrosine [ 10 ] . The most potent activating inputs are multivalent ligands containing both SH2 - and SH3 - binding motifs [ 11 ] . SH2 - containing phosphatase The SH2 - containing phosphatase - 2 ( SHP - 2 ; also known as SH - PTP2 ) contains a catalytic tyrosine phosphatase domain fused to two SH2 domains ( Figure 1b ; [ 12 – 14 ] ) . Under basal conditions , the phosphatase is inactive ; however , SH2 - binding motifs can stimulate activity . A composite bisphosphotyrosine motif , with proper spacing , is the most potent activator of this switch [ 15 ] . The modular logic of signaling proteins : building allosteric switches from simple binding domains Wendell A Lim N - WASP The Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ; the gene product mutated in the immunodeficiency disease Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome ) [ 16 ] and its more widely expressed neuronal homolog , N - WASP [ 17 ] , regulate actin polymerization and cell motility in response to multiple inputs . These proteins contain multiple N - terminal modules ( Figure 1c ) linked to a C - terminal output domain ( termed the verprolin cofilin acidic [ VCA ] domain ) that , when isolated , binds and constitutively activates the actin - related protein 2 / 3 ( Arp2 / 3 ) complex , a seven - protein complex that promotes actin filament nucleation [ 18 – 20 ] . This Arp2 / 3 stimulatory activity , however , is repressed in intact WASP proteins [ 21 , 22 ] . Multiple inputs have been reported to activate N - WASP [ 23 ] . Here , however , we focus only on the two best - understood inputs : the Rho family GTPase Cdc42 ( GTP - bound state ) and phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) [ 24 , 25 ] . One of the most striking properties of N - WASP is that , with respect to these two inputs , it behaves like a logical AND gate . Individually , Cdc42 and PIP 2 are weak activators , but together they act synergistically : co - stimulation with low concentrations of both yields potent activation [ 21 ] . Thus , N - WASP acts as a signal integration device that can precisely target actin poly - merization to sites at which both PIP 2 and activated Cdc42 are present . Repression through autoinhibition The output activities of these protein switches are controlled by autoinhibitory intramolecular interactions ( or , in some cases , intracomplex interactions ) involving their modular domains . Autoinhibition can be either ‘direct’ or ‘indirect’ . SHP - 2 provides an example of direct auto - inhibition : in the repressed state structure , the N - terminal SH2 domain binds and directly occludes the phosphatase active site ( Figure 1b ; [ 26 ] ) . This repression can occur even when the SH2 domains are added to the phosphatase domain in trans [ 14 ] . Src and N - WASP , however , provide examples of indirect , or conformational , autoinhibition . In these cases , two simultaneous intramolecular interactions are required for autoinhibition , neither of which can independently repress the output domain . In the repressed state of Src kinases , two intramolecular interactions occur : the SH2 domain binds the C - terminal phosphotyrosine motif , whereas the SH3 domain binds a proline - containing motif in the linker between the SH2 and kinase domains ( Figure 1a ) . Neither interaction directly blocks the active site . Repression instead is allosteric ; the pair of interactions leads to structural perturbations in the kinase active site [ 27 – 29 ] . In N - WASP , two interaction domains are also required for repression : a short basic ( B ) motif and the G protein binding / switching domain ( GBD ) ( Figure 1c ; [ 30 , 31 •• ] ) . In the absence of activating inputs , the B motif binds the Arp2 / 3 complex ( an intracomplex interaction ) , whereas the GBD binds to a small α helix in the VCA output domain ( intramolecular interaction ) . Although neither domain represses VCA output domain activity individually , the composite B – GBD segment is strongly repressive , even when added in trans [ 31 •• ] . Covalent linkage between the two domains is required for repression . Although the structure of the repressed N - WASP state is not known , these interactions may allosterically force the VCA domain – Arp2 / 3 complex to adopt an inactive conformation , as observed in the Src kinases . Alternatively , the pair of interactions might exert their effects by preventing motions required for activity . Activation by external inputs These switch proteins can be activated , or ‘derepressed’ , by the binding of external ligands to the regulatory domains involved in autoinhibition . There appear to be at least two general classes of activating ligands : simple competitive activators and conformational activators . Simple competitive activators are external ligands that are closely related to the intramolecular ligands ; for example , canonical SH2 - binding and SH3 - binding peptides or proteins can displace the 62 Folding and binding Table 1 Input / output properties observed for protein switches .

Conformational activators function by a somewhat more complex mechanism : although unrelated to the intra - molecular ligands , they disrupt binding by causing a conformational change in the regulatory module . In SHP - 2 , the N - terminal SH2 domain has two binding surfaces : one for external phosphotyrosine motifs and another that docks against the catalytic domain , mediating autoinhibition ( Figure 2a ) [ 26 ] . This SH2 domain appears to adopt two slightly different conformational states : an inhibitory ( I ) state , in which the autoinhibitory interaction with the phosphatase active site is favored , and an active ( A ) state , in which interaction with external phosphotyrosine motifs is favored ( Figure 2b ) . Thus , the two binding sites display negative cooperativity . The GBD module in the WASP family proteins is also regulated by conformational activation . Like the SHP - 2 N - terminal SH2 domain , the GBD can exist in two alternative states ( Figure 2c ) : an I state , in which it binds the cofilin - like α helix in the VCA domain as a part of autoinhibition [ 33 •• ] , and an A state , in which it binds to the GTP - bound form of Cdc42 [ 34 ] . Structural studies indicate that the two states are mutually exclusive . Thus , Cdc42 binding disrupts the GBD autoinhibitory interaction . A related GBD module found in the P 21 ( Cdc42 or Rac ) activated kinases appears to play a similar switching role to that in the WASP family proteins [ 35 – 37 , 38 •• , 39 ] . The Modular allosteric switches Lim 63 Figure 1 Domain architecture and autoinhibitory interactions in modular switch proteins . ( a ) Src family kinases contain N - terminal SH3 and SH2 domains , and a kinase domain flanked by intramolecular SH3 - binding and SH2 - binding sites ( when the C - terminal motif tyrosine is phosphorylated by Csk ) . The crystal structures of several family members show that both intramolecular domain interactions function in concert to lock the kinase in an inactive conformation . Activating stimuli ( red ) include external SH2 or SH3 ligands . After initial activation , the kinase is maintained in an active state by autophosphorylation of its activation loop . ( b ) SHP - 2 phosphatase contains two SH2 domains and a phosphatase domain . The crystal structure of the phosphatase shows that the N - terminal SH2 domain participates in an autoinhibitory interaction that directly blocks the phosphatase active site . Binding of external SH2 ligands activates by disrupting the autoinhibitory interaction . ( c ) N - WASP contains an Enabled VASP homology 1 ( EVH1 ) domain , a B motif , a GBD , a proline - rich segment ( pro ) and an output region ( VCA ) that alone binds the Arp2 / 3 complex and stimulates its actin nucleation activity . The B and GBD motifs are required to repress activity and , by current models , are thought to participate in intracomplex interactions ( only the structure of the GBD intramolecular complex for WASP is known ) .

However , little is known about the basis of the B motif interactions . Interestingly , the GBD itself has a modular architecture : it is composed of two functionally distinct but overlapping subdomains ( Figure 2d ) [ 31 •• , 33 •• , 35 , 36 , 38 •• , 40 ] . The first subdomain is the P 21 - binding domain ( PBD ) , which is homologous to other simple ( nonswitching ) Cdc42 - interacting regions ( including the canonical Cdc42 / Rac interactive binding [ CRIB ] motif ) . The second is the inhibitory segment ( IS ) , which binds to the intramolecular α - helical ligand . These two fragments share an overlapping region of sequence that adopts noncompatible structures in the A and I states . Thus , the GBD may have evolved from the overlap of two simple binding modules . 64 Folding and binding Figure 2 S H 2 S H 2 A state A state I state I state A state CRIB GBD 2 structure PBD IS Cdc42 Cofilin - like helix β 1 β 2 α 2 α 1 α 3 α 4 COOH NH 2 NH 2 COOH β 1 β 2 α 1 α 1 β 1 β 2 α 2 α 4 α 3 GBD GBD Cdc42 SHP - 2 phosphatase active site P Phospho - Tyr ligand Intramolecular ligand ( cofilin - like helix ) SHP - 2 N - terminal SH2 domain SHP - 2 phosphatase active site Intramolecular ligand ( cofilin - like helix ) I state A state Current Opinion in Structural Biology ( c ) ( d ) I state ( a ) ( b ) ‘Switching’ domains allow the disruption of autoinhibitory interactions by conformational activators . ( a ) The N - terminal SH2 domain from SHP - 2 can adopt two states : the inactive ( I ) state , which binds the phosphatase domain active site , and the active ( A ) state , which preferentially binds an external phosphotyrosine ligand . The two bindings events show negative cooperativity . ( b ) Comparison of the I and A states of the SHP - 2 N - terminal SH2 domain . Specific loops in the domain ( BG , red ; EF , green ) are colored to highlight the conformational displacement that occurs in the two states ( c ) WASP , N - WASP and P 21 - activated kinases ( PAKs ) share the GBD , which can adopt two distinct conformational states . In the I state ( black oval ) , the GBD binds an intramolecular α - helical ligand ( in WASP family members , the cofilin - like segment within the VCA output domain ) . In the A state ( black rectangular ) , the GBD binds GTP - bound Cdc42 . ( d ) Structures of both states of the GBD reveal the basis for switching . The GBD is composed of two overlapping binding functions : an N - terminal P 21 - binding domain ( PBD ) that includes the conserved CRIB motif and a C - terminal inhibitory segment ( IS ) that binds the cofilin - like helix . The overlapping regions of these two fragments ( β 1 , β 2 , α 1 ) are packed in a mutually incompatible manner in the two states . In the absence of either intramolecular or external ligands , the GBD is poorly structured . Multi - input switches : signal integration through interdomain linkage One of the most striking properties of these switch proteins is that they often do not display simple additive responses to activating inputs . Whereas individual inputs may be weak activators , specific combinations can yield synergistic activation . Here , we define synergistic activation to mean nonadditive activation : when the effect of the input com - binations exceeds the sum of the effects of the individual inputs . Such nonadditive effects are observed with combinations of multiple ligand species , as well as with multivalent composite ligands . This type of combinatorial control yields much higher signaling specificity . How do these allosteric switch proteins integrate the effects of multiple inputs when each binding event occurs at a distinct domain ? In principle , some form of coupling between domains is required . One simple mechanism that allows composite ligands to activate more potently is the higher affinity with which they Modular allosteric switches Lim 65 Figure 3 G B D V C A B Arp2 / 3 Off GBD Cdc42 PIP 2 PIP 2 B Arp2 / 3 V C A On Cdc42 PIP 2 ‘AND’ Actin polymerization Cdc42 PIP 2 Output – + – + – – + + – + + + + + + GBD Cdc42 B Arp2 / 3 V C A On GBD B Arp2 / 3 V C A On 50 % Activation contour 0 1 2 3 0 2 4 6 8 [ P I P 2 ] ( µ M ) [ Cdc42 ] ( µ M ) c = 350 c = 1 ObservedPredicted K PIP2 K Cdc42 K Cdc42 c K PIP2 c Distance from origin ( arbitrary units ) c = 350 c = 1 Input Output [ C d c 42 ] µ M ( ) [ P I P 2 ] µ M ( ) N - W ASP a c t i v i t y 0 . 2 0 . 1 0 0 . 2 0 . 1 0 0 . 3 0 . 6 0 . 4 0 . 2 0 0 . 8 ( c ) ( d ) ( a ) ( b ) Current Opinion in Structural Biology Signal integration in N - WASP is a result of interdomain cooperativity . ( a ) N - WASP , which regulates Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization , approximates a logical AND gate — individually , the two input ligands , Cdc42 and PIP 2 , are poor activators , but together they are potent activators . ( b ) Two - state model for the mechanism of signal integration . The size of reaction arrows reflects the favorability of the reaction . N - WASP can exist in two major states : first , a closed inactive state in which the two regulatory domains , B and GBD , are involved in coordinated autoinhibitory interactions ; and second , an open state in which these autoinhibitory interactions are released and the output ( VCA ) domain is active . In the closed state , the binding of either PIP 2 or Cdc42 ( red ) , individually , to the B or GBD domains is unfavorable ; however , once one input is prebound and the closed state is disrupted , binding of the subsequent ligand is more favorable , by the cooperativity factor , c . Thus , the two ligands cooperate to stabilize the open state . Note that cooperativity is indirect — it does not involve direct interactions between Cdc42 and PIP 2 . ( c ) Experimental signal integration of N - WASP fits the above model . Curves indicate the concentrations of the two inputs required to achieve 50 % activation , simulated using the above model and a c value of 1 ( no cooperativity ; dotted line ) or 350 ( solid line ) . The experimental behavior of a minimal construct of N - WASP ( circles ) fits this model with a high cooperativity value ( 31 ) . ( d ) Cooperativity provides a mechanism for signal integration . The top graph shows the hypothetical spatially overlapping concentration gradients of activated Cdc42 ( dotted line ) and PIP 2 ( solid line ) . The bottom graph shows the calculated response of N - WASP ( fraction maximal activity ) assuming the model shown in ( b ) and a cooperativity of either 1 or 350 . With high cooperativity , coincident signals are integrated and amplified . bind tandem interaction domains . The tandem SH2 domains of SHP - 2 bind with extremely high specificity to matched bisphosphotyrosine motifs , presumably because of avidity effects [ 41 , 42 ] . Correspondingly , such multivalent ligands are far more potent activators of the phosphatase than single ligands [ 15 ] . Thus , even though only one SH2 domain ( N - terminal ) is directly involved in autoinhibition ( Figure 1b ) , the second SH2 domain indirectly provides additional energy for disrupting the autoinhibitory interaction and imposes higher input selectivity [ 26 ] . A somewhat more sophisticated mechanism of thermo - dynamic linkage allows N - WASP to integrate the effects of inputs that bind to ostensibly independent binding domains ( Figure 3a ) . The activating ligands Cdc42 and PIP 2 bind to the GBD and B modules , respectively . Although the binding of Cdc42 and PIP 2 to the isolated B – GBD fragment is noncooperative , binding to an auto - inhibited form of N - WASP is highly cooperative [ 31 •• ] . The cooperative behavior can be explained by the model shown in Figure 3b . In the repressed state , N - WASP is held in a closed conformation by the autoinhibitory interactions of the B and GBD modules . Cdc42 and PIP 2 can individually disrupt these interactions and activate the complex ; however , because their binding sites are masked by competing autoinhibitory interactions , the binding of either input alone is relatively weak . In contrast , if one input is prebound , the closed state is already destabilized and the binding of the second input is significantly enhanced . Cdc42 and PIP 2 therefore mutually enhance each other’s binding to N - WASP by cooperating to stabilize the open state . This simple two - state model , in which the accessibility of the B and GBD domains to external ligand binding is coupled to the activation state of the output domain , can quantitatively describe the experimentally observed synergistic activation of N - WASP ( Figure 3c ) [ 31 •• ] This model , in turn , also provides a basis for the potent integration of multiple signals ( Figure 3d ) . Tight structural and thermodynamic coupling between domains is also observed in the Src family kinases ( Figure 4a ) . Experimental evidence indicates that the conformation of the kinase domain ( active versus inactive ) is coupled to the accessibility of the SH2 and SH3 domains to external ligand binding [ 43 , 44 ] . Moreover , targeted molecular dynamics simulations show that forcing the kinase domain into its active conformation results in the simultaneous displacement of the SH2 domain [ 45 ] . Such simulations also reveal that the motions of the SH2 and SH3 domains are highly correlated in the repressed state . Together , these studies yield a model in which the SH2 and SH3 domains function cooperatively to lock the kinase in a closed , 66 Folding and binding Figure 4 P P On P P P S H 2 S H 3 S H 2 S H 3 P S H 2 S H 3 Repressed state Activated state Unstable intermediate states i ii iii S H 2 S H 3 P P Off Off Off P P S H 2 S H 3 Off ‘Uncoupling’ mutations S H 3 S H 2 ( a ) ( b ) Current Opinion in Structural Biology Interdomain coupling in Src family kinases . ( a ) Thermodynamic cycle model of interdomain energetics and conformational coupling . The relative size of reaction arrows reflects the favorability of the reaction . Displacement of the individual SH domains or shift of the kinase to the active conformation ( via autophosphorylation ) are energetically unfavorable ; however , cooperative displacement of both SH domains allows stabilization of the active state ( followed by the positive feedback effect of autophosphorylation ) . Unstable intermediate states : i , SH3 release ; ii , SH2 release ; iii , kinase autophosphorylation / relaxation . ( b ) Uncoupling mutants are defined as mutations that yield a constitutively active kinase , although they do not disrupt the autoinhibitory interactions . Most such mutations are found in interdomain linker regions . Positions in Src kinases where uncoupling mutations have been found are colored in purple . repressed state ( Figure 4a ) . Although unexplored at present , such a model would predict highly cooperative activation by the combination of SH2 and SH3 ligands . How is coupling between distinct domains achieved ? Mutational studies have revealed that conformational properties of interdomain linker regions are critical for effective coupling . A mutation in the Src SH2 – SH3 inter - domain linker disrupts the interdomain coupling observed in simulations and correspondingly yields a constitutively active kinase ( Figure 4b ) . Recent structural studies of the isolated SH2 – SH3 segment from the Src kinase Fyn support the model in which the linker has unique properties : even without the kinase , the two regulatory domains and the linker maintain a disposition similar to that observed in the repressed kinases [ 46 ] . It is possible that linker sequence differences among the family members may help tune the degree of interdomain cooperativity . Other uncoupling mutations in Src kinases are found in the linker between the SH3 docking site and the kinase domain ( Figure 4b ) [ 47 , 48 ] . These mutations lead to the activation of the kinase even though the intramolecular SH3 interaction is maintained . Similarly , in N - WASP , cleavage of the linker between the B and GBD motifs disrupts repression of the output domain even though the individual autoinhibitory interactions are maintained [ 31 •• ] . Thus , the precise manner in which domains are linked is required for proper coupling and regulation . Conclusions Much of the complex behavior of these switch proteins can be understood within the framework of their modular construction . The allosteric systems described in this review could , in principle , have evolved from subtle shuffling and recombination of catalytic domains , interaction domains and internal ligand motifs [ 49 ] . The three modular switch proteins discussed here share the mechanism of using multiple binding domains to effect cooperative repression and , reciprocally , cooperative activation of a core catalytic function . This type of mechanism has several advantages for signaling switches . First , by functioning together , multiple weak interactions can yield more complete repression of the switch’s output activity . Second , positive cooperative activation by combi - nations of input ligands allows such switches to display higher input specificity and sensitivity . Third , because these activating ligands serve to properly localize the activated switch ( a property requiring the covalent tethering of the regulatory and catalytic domains ) , activation and localization are intrinsically coupled , leading to tight spatial control . It is interesting to note several parallel features of these modular switches and classical allosteric switches such as hemoglobin [ 50 ] . First , both types of switches have at their core an unregulated output activity that is repressed by additional interactions . Homologs of hemoglobin that are monomeric display unregulated but high - affinity oxygen binding ; this activity is repressed in the hemoglobin tetramer by subunit interactions that stabilize the low - affinity tense conformation . In modular switches , sets of intramolecular domain interactions force an unregulated output domain into an inactive state . Second , both types of switches utilize conformational changes to mediate linkage between distant binding and catalytic sites . In hemoglobin , changes in quaternary structure — the relationship between monomers — mediate this communication . In modular switches , communication is mediated by changes in the structural relationships between multiple domains within the same polypeptide . These simple conclusions have been drawn from studies of only a handful of modular signaling switches and studies of many other signaling systems will be required to determine their generality . Nonetheless , several basic principles emerge . In the future , a true measure of our understanding will be whether we are able to predict the input / output behavior of functionally uncharacterized signaling proteins purely on the basis of recognizing modular domains within their sequence . An additional challenge will be to apply our understanding of these systems by designing engineered protein switches . Such designer switches , such as engineered transcriptional elements , could be powerful tools for the study of signaling pathways and might eventually have therapeutic applications .

This study presents a thermodynamic model for the highly cooperative acti - vation of N - WASP by two inputs , Cdc42 and PIP 2 . This model provides a basis for the AND - gate - like behavior of N - WASP , which requires co - stimula - tion by the two inputs for potent activation . 32 .

This paper reveals the unusual conformational switching properties of the N - WASP GBD , which make it an extremely useful input for Cdc42 stimula - tion . This paper describes the NMR structure of the N - WASP GBD in its repressed state — a structure that is incompatible with the structure of the GBD in complex with Cdc42 ( see also [ 34 ] ) . 34 .

This structure , although not discussed in detail here because of space con - straints , reveals that P 21 - activated kinase utilizes a GBD module that is structurally very similar to that of WASP as a component in autoinhibition and , conversely , in Cdc42 - mediated activation . 39 .
