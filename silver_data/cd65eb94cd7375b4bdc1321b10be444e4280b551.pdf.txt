Here we describe the ﬁ rst small - molecule inhibitor ( FSC231 ) of the PDZdomaininproteininteractingwithCkinase1 ( PICK1 ) identi ﬁ edbya screening of ~ 44 , 000 compounds in a ﬂ uorescent polarization assay . The inhibitor bound the PICK1 PDZ domain with an af ﬁ nity similar to thatobservedforendogenouspeptideligands ( K i ~ 10 . 1 μ M ) . Mutation - al analysis , together with computational docking of the compound in simulationsstartingfromthePDZdomainstructure , identi ﬁ edthebind - ingmodeofFSC231 . Thespeci ﬁ cityofFSC231forthePICK1PDZdomain was supported by the lack of binding to PDZ domains of postsynaptic densityprotein95 ( PSD - 95 ) andglutamatereceptorinteractingprotein 1 ( GRIP1 ) . Pretreatment of cultured hippocampal neurons with FSC231 inhibited coimmunopreciptation of the AMPA receptor GluR2 subunit with PICK1 . In agreement with inhibiting the role of PICK1 in GluR2 traf ﬁ cking , FSC231 accelerated recycling of pHluorin - tagged GluR2 in hippocampalneuronsafterinternalizationinresponsetoNMDArecep - toractivation . FSC231blockedtheexpressionofbothlong - termdepres - sion and long - term potentiation in hippocampal CA1 neurons from acute slices , consistent with inhibition of the bidirectional function of PICK1insynapticplasticity . GiventheproposedroleofthePICK1 / AMPA receptor interaction in neuropathic pain , excitotoxicity , and cocaine addiction , FSC231 might serve as a lead in the future development of new therapeutics against these conditions . drug discovery | ﬂ uorescence polarization | protein – protein interactions | synaptic plasticity | AMPA receptors T he majority of currently available pharmacotherapeutics are targeted toward transmembrane receptor proteins such as G - protein - coupled receptors ( 1 ) . This is not surprising , given the impressive functional diversity of these proteins that allows for selective inhibition or activation of distinct disease - modulating signaling pathways . Nevertheless , receptor activation or blockade will inevitably affect the entire ensemble of signaling pathways to which the receptor is coupled and thereby often cause not only bene ﬁ cialeffectsbutalsounwantedsideeffects ( 2 , 3 ) . Anattractive alternative would be to develop medicines that instead target protein – protein interactions in a speci ﬁ c intracellular signal - transduction pathway ( 4 , 5 ) . PSD - 95 / Discs - large / ZO - 1 homology ( PDZ ) domains seem well suited for such efforts because they have a con ﬁ ned groove that typically binds the C - terminal three to four residues of the interaction partner ( 6 ) and thereby also are likely to accom - modate nonpeptide small - molecule inhibitors ( 7 ) . Additionally , PDZ domains are among the most common protein domains in the human genome serving important roles in protein traf ﬁ cking as well as in the formation of multiprotein signaling complexes ( 6 , 8 ) . Prototypical scaffolding proteins include postsynaptic density protein 95 ( PSD - 95 ) and glutamate receptor interacting protein 1 ( GRIP1 ) that contain several PDZ domains and op - erate as molecular adapters in neuronal synapses ( 6 , 8 ) . Recent ﬁ ndings support the idea that PDZ domains might indeed be valuable drug targets . Blocking the PDZ interaction between the NMDA glutamate receptor and PSD - 95 with membrane - permeable peptides results in selective inhibition of neuronal nitric oxide synthase ( nNOS ) activation , which is expected to reduce ischemic brain injury during stroke ( 2 , 3 ) . In cancer , recent evidence suggests that blocking the PDZ domains of Na + / H + exchanger regulatory factor 1 ( NHERF - 1 ) , dish - evelled , or AF - 6 might be interesting therapeutic approaches ( 9 – 11 ) . Furthermore , the PDZ domain of protein interacting with C kinase 1 ( PICK1 ) , which , e . g . , binds the C terminus of AMPA - type ionotropic glutamate receptors ( AMPA receptors ) ( 12 ) , has recently been recognized as a putative target in the treatment of neuropathic pain ( 13 ) , excitotoxicity ( 14 ) , and co - caine addiction ( 15 ) . Efforts have consequently been directed toward identi ﬁ cation of small - molecule nonpeptide PDZ domain inhibitors that could serve as leads in future drug discovery efforts ( 6 , 7 ) . However , only a few compounds have been identi ﬁ ed , and in general they display low af ﬁ nities for their target ( > 100 μ M ) ( 10 , 11 , 16 – 18 ) . Here we report the identi ﬁ cation of a nonpeptide small - molecule inhibitor ( FSC231 ) of the PICK1 PDZ domain . The compound has an af ﬁ nity similar to that observed for the endogenous peptide ligands ( K i ~ 10 μ M ) and displays highly interesting pharmacological activity , as demonstrated by its ability to affect AMPA receptor traf ﬁ cking and to inhibit synaptic plasticity in hippocampal CA1 neurons .

To identify small - molecule inhibitors of the PICK1 PDZ domain , we used a ﬂ uorescence polarization ( FP ) assay that detects binding of ﬂ uorescently labeled peptides to the PDZ domain of puri ﬁ ed PICK1 in solution ( 19 ) . We used a 96 - well format and an Oregon Green - labeled peptide ( OG - DAT C13 ) corresponding to the 13 C - terminal residues of the dopamine transporter ( DAT ) , a potent ligand of the PICK1 PDZ domain ( 19 ) , to screen a part of the small - molecule screening collection at Neurosearch A / S ( total number of screened compounds 43 , 880 ) for their ability to compete for binding of the ﬂ uorescent peptide . More than a hundred potentially interacting compounds were identi ﬁ ed ( de ﬁ ned by a > 20 % reduction in FP signal ) ; however , subsequent validation reduced the number of con ﬁ rmed hits to < 15 . One compound , FSC231 [ ( E ) - ethyl 2 - cyano - 3 ( 3 , 4 - di - chlorophenyl ) acryloylcarbamate ] ( Fig . 1 A ) , waschosenforfurther characterization . Competition FP assays showed potent dose - de - pendent inhibition of OG - DAT C13 binding to PICK1 [ K i = 10 . 1 μ M ( 8 . 9 ; 11 . 3 μ M ) , mean ( SE interval ) , n = 9 ] ( Fig . 1 B ) . A closely related analog of FSC231 without the cyano group ( FSC231 _ 9 ) ( Fig . 1 A ) did not inhibit OG - DAT C13 binding ( K i > 1000 μ M ) ( Fig . 1 B ) . At the excitation / emission wavelengths used for de - tection of Oregon Green ﬂ uorescence , we could not detect auto - ﬂ uorescence from FSC231 in concentrations up to 1 mM . To exclude that spectral properties of FSC231 interfered with the FP assay , we used , in addition , a DAT C13 peptide - labeled with Cy5 ( Cy5 - DAT C13 ) . FSC231 also potently inhibited binding of this peptide ( K i ~ 10 μ M , mean of n = 2 ) . We con ﬁ rmed the ability of FSC231 to block the interaction between PICK1 and DAT using a method not based on ﬂ uo - rescence . In agreement with previous data ( 20 ) , the C terminus of DAT ( 24C - terminal residues ) fused to gluthathione - S - transferase ( GST ) pulled down puri ﬁ ed PICK1 ( Fig . 1 C ) . The pull - down was blocked by a C - terminal peptide of the Glt1b glutamate trans - porter ( 10 residues ) ( Fig . 1 C ) , the most potent ligand for the PICK1 PDZ domain identi ﬁ ed so far ( 21 ) . The pull - down was also blocked in a dose - dependent manner by FCS231 , but only mar - ginally by FSC231 _ 9 ( Fig . 1 C ) . We further demonstrated that FSC231 most likely is a reversible inhibitor ( SI Note 1 ) . Binding Mode Prediction of FSC231 in the PDZ - Binding Crevice . FSC231 was docked into the crystallographic structure of the PDZ domain of human PICK1 ( 22 ) and into a mutant of the PDZ domain where Lys83 was substituted with histidine ( K83H ) , known from our previous studies to affect the peptide - binding speci ﬁ city ( 19 ) . The position of the compound in the ligand - binding cleft was re ﬁ ned and stabilized with Molecular Dynamics ( MD ) simulations . The ligand explored two orientations in the PDZ - binding crevice in which it is ﬂ ipped 180° with respect to the other ( SI Note 2 ) . In one mode ( mode 1 ) , which was preferred in the MD mulations for both wild type and K83H , the phenyl ring of FSC231 interacts at the P 0 position ( the position corre - sponding to the C - terminal residue of the peptide ligand ) ( Fig . 1 D and Fig . S1 ) . Of interest , the mutation produced according to the MD simulations a local change in the shape of the binding pocket that was suf ﬁ cient to establish a clear preference for the phenyl ring at P 0 . Calculations of the free energy of binding ( SI Methods ) also showed a ΔΔ G ~ 4 kcal / mol in favor of the mutant complex . This agrees with FP binding experiments showing a higher af ﬁ nity of FSC231 for K83H than for the wild type [ K83H , K i = 2 . 2 μ M ( 1 . 8 ; 2 . 1 ) , mean ( SE interval ) , n = 3 ] ( Fig . S2 ) . FSC231 Binds with an Af ﬁ nity Similar to the Natural Peptide Ligands and Shows Speci ﬁ city for the PICK1 PDZ Domain . The binding of the AMPA receptor GluR2 C terminus to the PICK1 PDZ domain is the most well - studied interaction of PICK1 and is believed to play a key role in long - term depression ( LTD ) as well as in long - PICK1 A C C on t r o l G l t 1 b 50 u M F S C 231 _ 9 50 u M F S C 231 10 u M F S C 231 2 u M F S C 231 0 50 100 B ound P I CK 1 ( % o f c on t r o l ) B - 7 - 6 - 5 - 4 - 3 0 . 00 0 . 25 0 . 50 0 . 75 1 . 00 Log [ lig a nd ] ( M ) B o un d O G D A T C 1 3 ( r e l a t i v e t o c on t r o l ) FSC231 _ 9 FSC231 D Cl Cl CN N H O O O Cl Cl N H O O O FSC231 FSC231 _ 9 Fig . 1 .

Importantly , FSC231 , but not FSC231 _ 9 lacking the cyano group , was able to inhibit binding of a ﬂ uorescently labeled C - terminal GluR2 peptide to the PICK1 PDZ domain with a potency similar to that seen for inhibition of DAT peptide binding [ 9 . 8 μ M ( 9 . 1 ; 11 μ M ) , n = 3 ] ( Fig . S3 A ) . Next we compared the potency of FSC231 directly to the po - tencies of the endogenous peptides . For GluR2 , it is believed that PKC α - mediated phosphorylation of Ser880 ( P − 3 position ) prevents the interaction of GluR2 with GRIP1 , another PDZ interactions partner of GluR2 , thereby shifting the GluR2 to - ward interaction with PICK1 ; hence , GluR2 phosphorylated at position 880 probably represents the physiologically relevant li - gand ( 27 ) . GluR2 wild type displayed a potency equal to that of FSC231 whereas the phosphorylated peptide ( GluR2 p880 ) displayed two - to threefold lower potency ( Fig . S3 B ) . To address whether FSC231 shows speci ﬁ city for the PICK PDZ domain , we established FP binding assays for three can - onical PDZ domains of PSD - 95 ( PDZ1 – 3 ) and for two PDZ domains of GRIP1 ( PDZ4 – 5 ) ( 8 ) . FSC231 in concentrations up to 1 mM was unable to compete for binding of a ﬂ uorescently tagged , C - terminal NMDA receptor ( NR2b subunit ) peptide to PDZ1 and - 2 and for binding of a C - terminal cysteine - rich PDZ - binding protein ( CRIPT ) to PDZ3 ( Fig . S4 ) . Similarly , FSC231 could not displace a ﬂ uorescently tagged C - terminal GluR2 peptide from PDZ domains 4 and 5 of GRIP1 ( Fig . S5 ) . FSC231InhibitstheInteractionBetweenGluR2andPICK1inHippocampal Neurons . To test whether FSC231 was able to pass the cell mem - brane and compete for intracellular PICK1 PDZ interactions in living cells , we measured ﬂ uorescence resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) in COS7 cells between PICK1 , fused at the N terminus to enhanced yellow ﬂ uorescent protein ( eYFP – PICK1 ) , and the C - terminal 29 residues of GluR2 , fused at the N terminus to en - hanced cyan ﬂ uorescent protein ( eCFP – GluR2 C29 ) ( 28 ) . The FRET signal between eCFP – GluR2 C29 and eYFP – PICK1 was higher than that in the negative control , coexpressed eCFP and eYFP , and lower than that seen for the positive control , a fusion protein between eCFP and eYFP ( eCeYFP ) ( Fig . 2 A ) . Incubation with 50 μ M FSC231 , but not FSC231 - 9 , signi ﬁ cantly reduced the eCFP – GluR2 / eYFP – PICK1 FRET signal ( Fig . 2 A ) , indicating that the compound was able to cross the cell membrane and block the interaction between the GluR2 C terminus and the PICK1 PDZ domain . This was further con ﬁ rmed in coimmunoprecipitation ( co - IP ) experiments performed to test whether FSC231 could inhibit the interaction between endogenously expressed PICK1 and GluR2 . In extracts from hippocampal neurons , GluR2 was present in immunoprecipitates obtained with mouse anti - PICK1 antibody , and in agreement with an inhibition of the PICK1 / GluR2 inter - action , signi ﬁ cantly less GluR2 was coimmunoprecipitated in extracts from neurons pretreated with 50 μ M FSC231 ( Fig . 2 B ) . Pretreatment with FSC231 - 9 did not decrease GluR2 co - IP ( nor - malized co - IP ~ 1 . 3 , mean of n = 2 ) . It is interesting to note that , in extracts from transfected HEK293 cells , FSC231 also inhibited co - IP of PICK1 with the metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR7 ( Fig . S6 ) , another PICK1 interaction partner ( 29 ) , further sub - stantiating the ability of FSC231 to block the interaction between the PICK1 PDZ domain and its binding partners in live cells . FSC231 Accelerates GluR2 Recycling After NMDA Receptor - Induced Internalization . PICK1 has been shown to promote intracellular accumulation of GluR2 in response to NMDA receptor activa - tion either by stimulating GluR2 internalization or inhibiting its recycling ( 30 , 31 ) . We tested whether FSC231 was able to block the inhibitory effect of PICK1 on GluR2 recycling by expressing GluR2 tagged at the N terminus with the pH - sensitive green ﬂ uorescent protein variant , pHluorin ( pH - GluR2 ) in hippo - campal neurons ( 31 ) . As shown before ( 31 ) , pH - GluR2 recycled back to the cell surface after NMDA receptor - induced in - ternalization , and in agreement with inhibiting the function of PICK1 , 50 μ M FSC231 accelerated pH - GluR2 recycling without signi ﬁ cantly affecting the amplitude of internalization ( Fig . 3 ) . We also employed a two - color single - cell assay based on immunolabeling that we used to study traf ﬁ cking of endoge - nously expressed GluR2 in response to direct activation of pro - tein kinase C ( PKC ) and thus independently of NMDA receptor activation . Consonant with the described role of the GluR2 / PICK1 interaction in PKC - mediated GluR2 redistribution ( 32 ) , FSC231 signi ﬁ cantly inhibited intracellular accumulation of GluR2 in response to phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ( Fig . S7 ) . FSC231 Inhibits LTD and LTP in CA1 Hippocampal Neurons . Blocking the PICK1 PDZ domain with a C - terminal peptide of the GluR2 C terminus can inhibit hippocampal and cerebellar LTD expres - sion ( 23 , 24 ) . ToassesswhethertheinhibitionofPICK1byFSC231 also would translate into an effect on LTD , we examined its effects in CA1 hippocampal neurons from acute slices .

Inclusion of FSC231 ( 50 μ M ) in the intracellular solution of the patch pipette signi ﬁ cantly reduced LTD ( Fig . 4 , A , B , and D ) . This reduction in LTD was similar to that seen for a C - terminal peptide of the GluR2 C terminus EVKI ( NVYGIEEVKI ) known to disrupt the PICK1 – GluR2 interaction ( Fig . 4 , B and C ) . No reduction was seen in response to the control peptide SVKE ( NVYGIESVKE ) , which does not bind PICK1 ( Fig . 4 , B and C ) . Recent data have suggested a putative role of PICK1 in NMDA receptor - dependent LTP as well ; e . g . , LTP was absent in acute slices from PICK1 knock - out mice ( 26 ) . Accordingly , we tested the effect of FSC231 ( 50 μ M ) on LTP expression in CA1 neurons in acute slices . Pairing a train of 50 stimulations at a frequency of 1 Hz with a depolarization of the postsynaptic cell to − 5 mV resulted in a robust and long - lasting LTP ( Fig . 4 E ) . Inclusion of FSC231 ( 50 μ M ) in the intracellular solution sig - ni ﬁ cantly reduced LTP ( Fig . 4 , E and F ) . Finally , we tested the effect of FSC231 on the recti ﬁ cation index and the basal NMDA receptor / AMPA receptor ratio . FSC231 had no effect and thus did not affect the basal synaptic properties ( Fig . S8 ) . Corre - spondingly , the basal synaptic properties were previously shown to be unaltered in acute slices from PICK1 knock - out mice as compared to wild type ( 26 ) ( SI Note 3 ) . Discussion Insight into cellular protein networks has increased dramatically in recent years , rendering such protein – protein interactions increasingly interesting as putative targets for therapeutic inter - vention . This is particularly tempting for protein – protein inter - actions in the CNS where organization of larger multiprotein signaling complexes in distinct compartments is highly critical for neuronal function ( 7 ) . Due to their key roles in the formation of these complexes , PDZ domains are predicted to be attractive targets because their well - de ﬁ ned binding crevices are likely to accommodate nonpeptide small - molecule ligands ( 6 ) . In line with this , we have identi ﬁ ed a small - molecule inhibitor ( FSC231 ) of the PICK1 PDZ domain . We focused on PICK1 because it is an important dimeric scaffolding protein widely expressed in the CNS ( 33 ) and because recent studies have suggested that the PICK1 PDZ domain might be an appealing drug target in relation to at least three cases involving dysfunc - tion of AMPA receptor regulation and representing three unmet medical needs . In relation to neuropathic pain , it was observed that disruption of the interaction with the AMPA receptor by intrathecal injection of membrane - permeable PICK1 - speci ﬁ c peptides alle - viated neuropathic re ﬂ ex sensitization induced by chronic con - striction injury ( 13 ) . For excitotoxicity following cerebral trauma , PICK1 - binding peptides preserved surface GluR2 expression , which in turn attenuated AMPA - receptor - mediated neuronal toxicity ( 14 ) . For cocaine sensitization , it was observed that i . p . injection of a membrane - permeable PICK1 - speci ﬁ c peptide before a single dose of cocaine abolished development of synaptic plasticity in the ven - tral tegmental area ( 15 ) . This plasticity is thought to underlie co - caine - induced behavioral sensitization and conditioned place preference , both considered core components of addiction ( 34 ) . Molecular modeling and computational simulations indicated how FSC231 can be accommodated within the PDZ - binding crevice in a binding mode that resembles that suggested for a small - molecule inhibitor of the AF6 PDZ domain ( 11 ) . The af - ﬁ nity of FSC231 for the crevice was ~ 10 μ M , which is essentially identical to that seen for the C - terminal peptide of the GluR2 subunit of the AMPA receptor and a few - fold higher than the af - ﬁ nity of the corresponding phosphorylated peptide ( pSer880 ) , believed to be the physiological ligand ( 27 ) . According to both FRET and coimmunoprecipitation experiments , FSC231 was able to cross the plasma membrane and inhibit the interaction between GluR2 and PICK1 in living cells . Moreover , FSC231 interfered with GluR2 traf ﬁ cking , which is consistent with inhibiting the role of PICK1 in slowing down GluR2 recycling and / or accelerating GluR2 internalization . Finally , FSC231 was shown to inhibit both LTD and LTP expression in CA1 hippocampal neurons , which is consistent with inhibition of PICK1 ’ s bidirectional effectof PICK1 on synaptic plasticity ( 26 ) . Only a few small - molecule PDZ domain inhibitors have been described in the literature ( 10 , 11 , 16 , 17 , 35 , 36 ) . Most of these have been designed on the basis of selected scaffolds rather than high - throughput screening of compound libraries including in - hibitors of , e . g . , dishevelled [ af ﬁ nity up to ~ 10 μ M ( 10 , 36 ) ] and NHERF1 ( af ﬁ nity ~ 15 μ M ) ( 35 ) . Although a putative inhibitor of the nNOS / PSD - 95 interaction was recently identi ﬁ ed by screening ~ 150 , 000 compounds ( 37 ) , high - throughput screening has in generalappeared very challenging ; forexample , screeningof more than 100 , 000 compounds against Mint1 did not lead to identi - ﬁ cationofanyspeci ﬁ cbinders ( 18 ) .

An important remaining task is to improve further the af ﬁ nity , preferentially into the nanomolar range . Given that screening of phage libraries has identi ﬁ ed short peptides with af ﬁ nities in this range , e . g . , for the Erbin PDZ domain ( 38 ) , it is not unlikely that the nonpeptide small - molecule ligands can achieve such high af - ﬁ nity . Moreover , it is of interest that peptidomimetics have been developed against the PDZ domain of α 1 - syntrophin and PDZ1 and PDZ2 of PSD - 95 with af ﬁ nities of ≈ 0 . 5 – 1 μ M ( 39 , 40 ) . PDZ domain selectivity also may be of some concern in the design of inhibitors , given the structural conservation and the fact that the human genome encodes up to 540 different PDZ domains . Our results for FSC231 suggest , however , that selectivity is ach - ievable ( at least among the domains tested ) , as we found that FSC231 did not affect binding of peptide ligands to the PDZ domainsofPSD - 95andGRIP , demonstratingthatitisnotageneral PDZ inhibitor . In addition , our computational studies suggested a highly unfavorable binding mode for FSC231 upon docking into yet other PDZ domains , such as that of AF6 and Dishevelled . Insummary , wehavedemonstratedthatscreeningofacompound library can successfully identify small - molecule nonpeptide com - pounds that ﬁ t in the PDZ - binding crevice . The compound identi - ﬁ ed ( FSC231 ) represents a previously undescribed small - molecule inhibitor of the PICK1 PDZ domain and displays an af ﬁ nity similar to , or even higher than , that observed for the endogenous C - terminal peptide ligands . Importantly , we show that FSC231 exhibits both selectivity for the PICK1 PDZ domain and interesting pharmacological activity . It should be borne in mind that blocking the PICK1 PDZ domain might not always be advantageous ; i . e . , inhibiting the interaction between PICK1 and mGluR7 can poten - tially cause absence - like seizures ( 41 ) . Nevertheless , it will still be highly interesting in future experimental efforts to further evaluate FSC231 as a putative lead compound for the development of new therapeutics against , e . g . , neuropathic pain and cocaine addiction .
