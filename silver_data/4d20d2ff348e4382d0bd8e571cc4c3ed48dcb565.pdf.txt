Lennarz , Stony Brook University , Stony Brook , NY , February 11 , 2003 ( received for review December 26 , 2002 ) On the basis of temperature dependency , saturability , selective inhibition , and substrate speciﬁcity , it has been proposed that an anandamide transporter exists . However , all of these studies have examined anandamide accumulation at long time points when downstream effects such as metabolism and intracellular seques - tration are operative . In the current study , we have investigated the initial rates ( < 1 min ) of anandamide accumulation in neuro - blastoma and astrocytoma cells in culture and have determined that uptake is not saturable with increasing concentrations of anandamide . However , anandamide hydrolysis , after uptake in neuroblastoma cells , was saturable at steady - state time points ( 5 min ) , suggesting that fatty acid amide hydrolase ( FAAH ) may be responsible for observed saturation of uptake at long time points . In general , arvanil , olvanil , and N - ( 4 - hydroxyphenyl ) arachidonyl - amide ( AM404 ) have been characterized as transport inhibitors in studies using long incubations . However , we found these ‘‘trans - port inhibitors’’ did not inhibit anandamide uptake in neuroblas - toma and astrocytoma cells at short time points ( 40 sec or less ) . Furthermore , we conﬁrmed that these inhibitors in vitro were actually inhibitors of FAAH . Therefore , the likely mechanism by which the transport inhibitors raise anandamide levels to exert pharmacological effects is by inhibiting FAAH , and they should be reevaluated in this context . Immunoﬂuorescence has indicated that FAAH staining resides mainly on intracellular membranes of neuroblastoma cells , and this ﬁnding is consistent with our ob - served kinetics of anandamide hydrolysis . In summary , these data suggest that anandamide uptake is a process of simple diffusion . This process is driven by metabolism and other downstream events , rather than by a speciﬁc membrane - associated anandam - ide carrier . T he endocannabinoids , including anandamide , are a class of neurotransmitters , similar to (cid:1) 9 - tetrahydracannabinol , in - volved in multiple physiological events including nociception , memory , blood pressure , locomotion , and immunity ( for review , see ref . 1 ) . These compounds bind the CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors , which are G i - coupled receptors that modulate ion channels and signal transduction pathways ( 2 – 4 ) . Anandamide is readily taken up into cells . The first step of this process has been characterized by several laboratories as a process of facilitated diffusion ( for reviews , see refs . 5 and 6 ) . Although an anandamide transporter has never been isolated , its existence is based on an anandamide uptake process that is temperature - dependent , selective , and saturable . In addition , several studies identified compounds that inhibit anandamide accumulation , including N - ( 4 - hydroxyphenyl ) arachidonylamide ( AM404 ) and the vanilloids arvanil and olvanil ( 7 – 16 ) . After uptake , if fatty acid amide hydrolase ( FAAH ) is present , anandamide is hydrolyzed to arachidonic acid and ethanolamine ( for review , see ref . 17 ) . A recent report investigating the role of FAAH in anandamide metabolism showed that FAAH (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice had 15 - fold higher anandamide concentrations within the brain relative to wild - type mice and , after administration of exogenous anandamide , had reduced pain sensation and rectal tempera - ture , and spontaneous activity and catalepsy . Also , brain ho - mogenate from FAAH (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice had 100 - fold less anandamide hydrolysis activity than wild type ( 18 ) . This finding suggests that FAAH is the main enzyme responsible for metabolizing anan - damide within the mouse . FAAH activity has been identified as a factor affecting anandamide uptake in cell culture . Time courses of anandamide uptake showed that in the first minute , initial rates of anand - amide uptake are greater than later steady - state time points . At time points long enough to allow for metabolism , cells with FAAH take up significantly more anandamide than cells ex - posed to an FAAH inhibitor ( 10 , 13 , 14 , 19 ) . In addition , cells transfected with FAAH accumulated significantly more anand - amide than vector - transfected cells at time points allowing for metabolism ( 10 ) . The activity of FAAH drives continued anan - damide accumulation by maintaining the anandamide concen - tration gradient across the plasma membrane ( 9 , 10 ) . Some questions concerning anandamide uptake remain un - answered , however . Why does every cell type studied have the ability to take up anandamide ( K m range (cid:3) 0 . 1 – 190 (cid:1) M ) ( 7 – 15 ) ? Are ‘‘transport inhibitors’’ actually functioning as FAAH inhib - itors ? Finally , because all prior studies examined only anand - amide accumulation at time points when downstream effects such as metabolism and intracellular sequestration could be observed , do the initial anandamide uptake rates exhibit the characteristics of a carrier - mediated process ? In the current study , we have investigated whether initial anandamide uptake is a saturable process in a manner similar to that used for fatty acid transporters ( for review , see ref . 20 ) . We also examined the saturability of anandamide metabolism by FAAH at long time points similar to those commonly used in the literature . Several compounds characterized as transport inhib - itors were examined at both early uptake ( to investigate trans - port inhibition ) and late time points ( to investigate inhibition of downstream events such as hydrolysis and intracellular seques - tration ) . These compounds were then analyzed as possible FAAH inhibitors . In addition , all transport assays were per - formed in the presence of BSA to increase the solubility of anandamide in the uptake medium , similar to FAAH assays and cannabinoid receptor binding assays , but unlike most transport studies . In contrast to prior studies , we propose that anandamide uptake is a process of simple diffusion . In addition , we believe the transport inhibitors used in this study do not directly act on an anandamide transporter but rather inhibit downstream effects such as metabolism and intracellular sequestration . This inhibi - tion results in an attainment of equilibrium across the membrane and prevents any further net accumulation of anandamide . Methods Cell Culture .

All cells were grown at 37°C and with 5 % CO 2 . Determination of Transport Kinetics . Neuroblastoma and astrocy - toma cells were incubated for either 3 or 25 – 40 sec at 37°C in 750 (cid:1) l of supplemented medium [ DMEM or RPMI medium 1640 (cid:5) 0 . 4 % fatty acid - free BSA ( Sigma ) ] containing 40 nCi ( 1 Ci (cid:3) 37 GBq ) of arachidonoyl - 5 , 6 , 8 , 9 , 11 , 12 , 14 , 15 - [ 3 H ] ethanolamide [ 172 Ci (cid:1) mmol , 62 . 2 nCi (cid:1) (cid:1) l ( NEN ) ] and unlabeled anandamide ( Cayman Chemical , Ann Arbor , MI ) at final concentrations of 0 . 01 – 200 (cid:1) M anandamide . Ice - cold supplemented DMEM ( 3 ml ) was added . Cells were washed and scraped three times with 400 (cid:1) l of 2 mM EDTA in PBS . Next , 2 . 5 ml of 1 : 1 chloroform (cid:1) methanol was added , samples were spun down , and the organic phase was counted in an LKB Beta scintillation counter . Specific anandamide uptake was determined by subtracting the pmol anandamide in 3 - sec samples from 25 - to 40 - sec samples . To determine whether the data fit a saturating curve and whether a K m and V max could be determined , data were analyzed with a Michaelis Menten plot in ENZPACK for WINDOWS ( Bio - soft , Cambridge , U . K . ) and by fitting the data to a rectangular hyperbola and a linear curve using the linear regression program SIGMAPLOT ( SPSS , Chicago ) . Experiments were repeated five times . Representative graphs are shown . Enzyme Assay of FAAH Inhibitors . The enzyme assay was conducted as described ( 10 ) . AM404 , methylarachidonylfluorophos - phonate ( MAFP ) , arvanil , and olvanil were purchased from Cayman Chemical . Incubations were performed in triplicate at 37°C while shaking . Each sample contained 10 (cid:1) l of 50 mg (cid:1) ml fatty acid - free BSA ( Sigma – Aldrich ) , 180 (cid:1) g of rat brain ho - mogenate , test compounds in ethanol , and 30 (cid:1) M anandamide ( Cayman Chemical ) (cid:5) 0 . 01 mCi of 120 mCi (cid:1) mmol arachidonoyl ethanolamide [ ethanolamine - 1 , 2 - 14 C ] ( NEN ) . Negative control tubes lacked cell extract . The reactions were terminated after 30 min by the addition of 2 volumes chloroform : methanol ( 1 : 1 ) . Samples were spun , and the aqueous phase was measured by liquid scintillation counting . Data were graphed by using SIGMAPLOT as percent inhibition of untreated homogenate ac - tivity . IC 50 values were calculated from the graphs . Experiments were repeated three times . Representative curves are shown . Saturation of FAAH Activity After Uptake by Neuroblastoma Cells . The transport kinetics protocol described previously was used , using 0 . 01 mCi of 120 mCi (cid:1) mmol arachidonoyl ethanolamide [ ethanolamine - 1 , 2 - 14 C ] , with a final concentration range of 10 – 200 (cid:1) M . Cells were incubated for 5 min or 25 sec . After the addition of 1 : 1 chloroform (cid:1) methanol , the aqueous phase was counted to measure ethanolamine production . The presence of unhydrolyzed ethanolamine in samples was estimated by incu - bating cells for 3 sec , and this value was subtracted from all time points to determine specific metabolism . Data were analyzed as described previously . Experiments were repeated three times . Representative curves are shown . Inhibition of Anandamide Uptake . Growth media were removed , and cells were washed once . Cells were preincubated for 10 min in supplemented medium containing inhibitor at the concentra - tion specified . Medium was removed , and cells were incubated for 25 sec , 40 sec , or 5 min in supplemented medium containing inhibitor , anandamide , and [ 3 H ] anandamide so that 40 nCi ( 100 nM anandamide ) bathed the cells . The reaction was terminated , and cells were processed as described previously . Nonspecific binding values were subtracted from all points . The degree of uptake inhibition was obtained by averaging the triplicates and plotting these values as a percent inhibition ( of control cells ) by using SIGMAPLOT . Statistical significance of inhibition was de - termined with Student’s t test calculations by using Microsoft EXCEL . All experiments were repeated three times . FAAH Immunoreactivity in Neuroblastoma Cells . Neuroblastoma cells were plated on poly ( L - lysine ) - coated coverslips ( VWR Scientific ) at a density of 4 (cid:4) 10 5 cells per 35 - mm plate . The next day , cells were treated with 1 (cid:1) g (cid:1) ml wheat germ agglutinin Alexa Fluor 594 conjugate ( Molecular Probes ) for 15 min on ice . Cells were washed for 10 min three times in cold PBS (cid:5) Ca 2 (cid:5) (cid:5) Mg 2 (cid:5) ( pH 7 . 2 , 133 mM NaCl , 6 . 6 mM K 2 HPO 4 (cid:5) 1 . 5 mM KH 2 PO 4 (cid:5) 1 mM CaCl 2 (cid:5) 1 mM MgCl 2 ) and then fixed in 3 % paraformaldehyde in PBS (cid:5) Ca 2 (cid:5) (cid:5) Mg 2 (cid:5) at room temperature for 15 min . Cells were washed three times with PBS (cid:5) Ca 2 (cid:5) (cid:5) Mg 2 (cid:5) and then permeabilized on ice for 5 min with 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 (cid:5) 0 . 5 % normal goat serum ( NGS ) in PBS (cid:5) Ca 2 (cid:5) (cid:5) Mg 2 (cid:5) . Cells were washed three times with 2 % NGS in PBS (cid:5) Ca 2 (cid:5) (cid:5) Mg 2 (cid:5) and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 1 : 1 , 000 rabbit anti - rat FAAH IgG ( gift from Benjamin Cravatt , The Scripps Research Institute , La Jolla , CA ) PBS (cid:5) Ca 2 (cid:5) (cid:5) Mg 2 (cid:5) (cid:5) 5 % NGS . Cells were washed three times and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in 1 : 625 goat anti - rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 488 ( Molecular Probes ) in PBS (cid:5) Ca 2 (cid:5) (cid:5) Mg 2 (cid:5) (cid:5) 5 % NGS . Cells were washed three times and mounted with VECTASHIELD ( Vector Laboratories ) and stored at (cid:2) 20°C . Images were taken with a Leica TCS SP2 laser scanning confocal microscope . The final magnification was (cid:4) 345 ( (cid:4) 100 with the objective and (cid:4) 3 . 45 electronically ) . TIFF images were optimized for brightness and contrast by using PHOTOSHOP ( Adobe Sys - tems , Mountain View , CA ) . Results Initial Anandamide Uptake Rates in Astrocytoma and Neuroblastoma Cells Are Unsaturable . Anandamide transport was examined in two cell types by using short incubation times to isolate membrane transport activity from downstream metabolic effects . Astrocy - toma cells , which lack hydrolase activity ( 7 ) , were compared with neuroblastoma cells , which have high levels of FAAH activity ( 10 ) . Astrocytoma cells were examined after incubation in uptake medium for 40 sec , which is before the attainment of a steady state ( data not shown ) . After incubation with increasing concentrations ( up to 100 (cid:1) M ) of anandamide , astrocytoma cells had initial uptake rates that yielded a straight line ( r 2 (cid:3) 0 . 999 ; Fig . 1 ) . These data indicate that anandamide uptake is not saturable and therefore is not carrier - mediated . Neuroblastoma cells were examined after incubation for 25 sec , which is before hydrolysis of anandamide by FAAH ( data not shown ) . Steady - state rates of uptake in neuroblastoma cells occur after 1 min ( 10 ) . Similarly , neuroblastoma cells also had a linear anandam - ide accumulation rate ( r 2 (cid:3) 0 . 993 ) after incubation at short time points with increasing concentrations ( up to 200 (cid:1) M ) of anan - damide ( Fig . 2 A ) . Anandamide Metabolism After Uptake Is Saturable . The effect of metabolism on anandamide uptake was studied in neuroblas - toma cells . Cells were allowed to incubate for 5 min in uptake medium containing increasing concentrations of anandamide ( 10 – 200 (cid:1) M ) . This extended incubation time permitted FAAH to drive uptake through metabolism of intracellular anandamide ( 10 ) . The observed rate of anandamide metabolism was satu - rating at high anandamide concentrations , the calculated K m was 28 . 1 (cid:1) M , and the V max was 19 . 0 pmol (cid:1) sec per 10 6 cells ( Fig . 2 B ) . When the same experiment was conducted for 25 sec , no 4270 (cid:2) www . pnas . org (cid:1) cgi (cid:1) doi (cid:1) 10 . 1073 (cid:1) pnas . 0730816100 Glaser et al . significant anandamide metabolism was observed ( P (cid:6) 0 . 07 ; data not shown ) . Transport Inhibitors Arvanil , Olvanil , and AM404 Inhibit Anandamide Hydrolysis . Other laboratories have reported that transport in - hibitors also inhibit FAAH ( for reviews , see refs . 5 and 6 ) . We tested this theory by using an FAAH activity assay to examine the effects of AM404 , arvanil , and olvanil on anandamide hydrolysis . Rat brain homogenate was incubated with 30 (cid:1) M anandamide and increasing concentrations of each transport inhibitor . All compounds tested inhibited FAAH activity in this system . The IC 50 values of arvanil , olvanil , and AM404 are 3 , 20 , and 6 (cid:1) M , respectively ( Fig . 3 ) . MAFP , AM404 , Arvanil , and Olvanil Affect Downstream Events , Not Initial Anandamide Uptake Rates . Because we established that these compounds inhibit anandamide metabolism , we examined the effects of a preincubation with these and another FAAH inhib - itor , MAFP ( 22 , 23 ) , on anandamide accumulation . A time point was chosen that was long enough to allow for downstream mechanisms to influence uptake ( 10 ) . After a 5 - min incubation in medium containing anandamide , astrocytoma ( which lack hydrolysis activity ) and neuroblastoma ( which contain active FAAH ) cells both showed a statistically significant reduction in anandamide accumulation ( P (cid:7) 0 . 05 ) relative to cells treated only with vehicle ( Fig . 4 ) . In sharp contrast , when similar experiments were performed by using short time points that represented initial uptake rates , very different results were observed . A preincubation with every compound tested had no significant effect on [ 3 H ] anandamide accumulation within as - trocytoma cells at 40 - sec uptake time points ( P (cid:6) 0 . 5 ; Fig . 5 A ) .

FAAH Is Immunolocalized Perinuclearly in Neuroblastoma Cells . Be - cause FAAH activity plays a key role in anandamide uptake , its localization relative to the plasma membrane is of interest . Neuro - blastoma cells were treated with wheat germ agglutinin to mark the plasma membrane ( 21 ) and immunostained for FAAH with an Ab used previously in immunolocalization studies ( 24 ) . Confocal flu - orescencemicroscopyidentifiedpunctateFAAHimmunoreactivityperinuclearly . In addition , a lack of colocalization with wheat germ agglutinin indicated that FAAH was not located in the plasma membrane ( Fig . 6 ) . Identical experiments using astrocytoma cells were immunonegative for FAAH ( data not shown ) . Discussion The concept of an anandamide transporter has become widely accepted with the exception of one theoretical article ( 25 ) . It has been characterized as a process of facilitated diffusion , meaning that uptake is mediated by a carrier , and is driven by a concen - tration gradient across the plasma membrane ( for review , see refs . 5 and 6 ) . Although the transport protein has never been isolated , this process has been defined as being protein - mediated , because it is temperature - dependent , saturable , se - lective for anandamide , and able to be inhibited . Temperature dependency has been used as an indicator of carrier - mediated anandamide transport ( 8 , 26 – 28 ) . Problems arise , however , when using this criterion to determine protein involvement in uptake . First , hydrolysis by FAAH is also tem - perature - dependent . All prior studies of anandamide uptake used incubation time points that were long enough to allow for its metabolism ( 10 , 25 ) . If FAAH is present within the cell , its activity will maintain the anandamide concentration gradient across the membrane ( 10 ) in a temperature - dependent manner . Another complication that arises when using temperature de - pendence to determine protein involvement in anandamide uptake is that it also affects simple diffusion ( 29 ) . Because temperature affects the fluidity of membranes , we chose to use 3 - sec incubations at 37°C to more accurately reflect the non - specific binding of anandamide to the plasma membrane , as opposed to 4°C as commonly used by others . Saturability is a second hallmark for protein - mediated trans - port . Multiple laboratories , including ours , have published arti - cles characterizing saturable transport of anandamide in a variety of cell types ( for reviews , see refs . 5 and 6 ) , including the neuroblastoma and astrocytoma cell lines used in this study ( 10 , 12 ) . The kinetics were always determined by using time points (cid:6) 1 min . As a result , the saturation of uptake in these studies could not only be due to the presence of a transport protein , but also could be due to downstream processes such as hydrolysis by FAAH or possibly intracellular sequestration . In this study , we used time points short enough to avoid such complications so that the initial transport of anandamide could be examined for saturability and specific inhibition by transport inhibitors . In data presented previously ( Figs . 1 and 2 A ) , this reduction in the incubation time resulted in unsaturable anan - damide accumulation in both neuroblastoma and astrocytoma cells . These results suggest that no transport protein is involved , and that anandamide uptake is due to simple diffusion , a process that is not saturable . These kinetic values measure only the total concentration of anandamide in the uptake medium , rather than the amount remaining uncomplexed to albumin , which is the common practice in the fatty acid field . Unlike in fatty acids , however , there are no direct means of examining free anand - amide levels in solution , such as the use of a fluorescent probe . In addition , the limited solubility of anandamide in aqueous solutions prohibits the use of uptake solutions lacking albumin . Our examination of initial kinetics of anandamide transport suggests a mechanism of simple diffusion . Lending further credence to the hypothesis that uncharged , hydrophobic anandamide can easily enter a membrane unaided , the crystal structure of FAAH indicates that the hydrophobic entryway to the active site of the enzyme is adjacent to the membrane from which anandamide is recruited ( 30 ) . In addition , preliminary studies examining the process of CB1 cannabinoid receptor activation suggest that anandamide is able to approach the receptor by entering the lipid ( P . Reggio , personal commu - nication ) and may first interact with the lipid face of receptor helix TMH6 ( 31 ) . Saturation was observed , however , when neuroblastoma up - take was permitted to continue for long time points , and metabolite production was examined after uptake ( Fig . 2 B ) . These data suggest that many prior studies using long time points may have been measuring rates of continued accumulation driven by downstream protein - mediated effects , rather than transport . This observation that FAAH activity could be falsely identified as protein - mediated transport is supported further by the literature where the reported K m range of FAAH ( 0 . 8 – 180 (cid:1) M ; refs . 8 , 28 , and 32 – 37 ) is in the same broad range as the reported K m of transport ( 0 . 1 – 190 (cid:1) M ; refs . 7 – 15 ) .

Substrate specificity is the third indicator of protein - mediated transport and has been examined in anandamide analog com - petition studies ( 12 , 38 ) . By varying structural features of analogs and coincubating cells with these analogs and anandamide , they observed changes in the ability of a cell to accumulate anand - amide . From these experiments , it was concluded that anand - amide uptake is a protein - mediated process , because there seems to be a degree of specificity for the anandamide structure . Although one study did investigate the FAAH inhibitory effects of these compounds ( 38 ) , both failed to address how these structural variations could influence uptake by affecting simple diffusion , metabolism , and intracellular sequestration . To ac - count for the slower rate of cellular uptake of palmitoyl eth - anolamide relative to anandamide , it has been suggested that separate transporters may be involved ( 8 ) . However , an alternate explanation is that palmitoyl ethanolamide is also transported by simple diffusion and its uptake is less efficient because it is a poorer substrate than anandamide for FAAH ( 17 ) . The final feature of facilitated diffusion is selective inhibition of transport . Numerous compounds have been tested as anandamide transport inhibitors . Steady - state measurements of anandamide accumulation after exposure to known protein - modifying transport inhibitors , such as 4 , 4 (cid:9) - diisothiocyanostilbene - 2 , 2 (cid:9) - disulfonic acid ( DIDS ) ( 11 ) , phloretin ( 7 , 11 ) , and N - ethylmaleimide ( NEM ) ( 6 , 8 , 28 ) , have resulted in either no effect on anandamide transport or controversial results . However , many compounds have been shown to inhibit anandamide accumulation , including AM404 , arvanil , and olvanil . We found that these compounds also inhibit hydrolysis ( Fig . 3 ) . Our results confirmed earlier studies where AM404 was shown to inhibit FAAH with an IC 50 range of 500 nM to 3 . 6 (cid:1) M ( 38 , 39 ) , and arvanil with an IC 50 of 630 nM ( 39 ) . These studies are in sharp contrast to those indicating that AM404 ( 7 ) , arvanil ( 40 ) , and olvanil ( 41 ) had minimal FAAH inhibitory effects and there - fore must be inhibiting an anandamide transporter . The enzyme IC 50 values of AM404 , arvanil , and olvanil are extremely similar to reported transport IC 50 values ( all ranging from 2 . 2 to 9 (cid:1) M ; refs . 7 , 38 , and 42 – 44 ) . Because many transport inhibition studies used cells that express FAAH and used long uptake times , their obser - vations may be due to these compounds reducing anandamide accumulation through the inactivation of FAAH , rather than direct inhibition of a transporter . As originally proposed by our laboratory ( 45 ) , FAAH inhibitors raise anandamide levels to produce phar - macological effects ( 46 ) , and this is probably the mechanism by which ‘‘anandamide transport inhibitors’’ produce their response in vivo ( 47 – 49 ) . These inhibitors have therefore been suggested as being therapeutically useful in areas affected by the endocannabi - noid system such as analgesia , nausea , appetite , sedation , memory , locomotion , glaucoma , and immune function ( 45 ) . Although this current study confirmed that these compounds are able to inhibit anandamide uptake by cells expressing FAAH when time points are long enough to allow for hydrolysis ( Fig . 4 B ) , it also demonstrated that at time points before significant hydrolysis , no inhibition was observed ( Fig . 5 B ) . These obser - vations suggest that these compounds do not inhibit a transporter but rather an event downstream . This inhibition leads to a loss of the concentration gradient across the plasma membrane that is necessary to drive anandamide uptake . Our inhibitor studies using astrocytoma cells , which lack anandamide hydrolase activity ( data not shown and ref . 7 ) , suggest that other downstream mechanism ( s ) besides hydrolysis by FAAH may also affect anandamide uptake . The addition of transport inhibitors induced a slight , but significant , inhibition observed at longer time points ( Fig . 4 A ) . Although these com - pounds could be inhibiting a carrier at long time points , it is improbable because no inhibition was observed at short time points ( Fig . 5 A ) . It is likely that these compounds , which are all structurally similar to anandamide , are affecting other down - stream machinery , including intracellular sequestration by mem - branes or proteins . This mechanism may explain the saturating kinetics observed by others . Prior immunohistochemical studies of the rat central nervous system described FAAH localization as punctate within the cell bodies and dendrites of pyramidal and Purkinje cells ( 24 , 50 ) . The perinuclear , punctate pattern observed by us in neuroblastoma cells ( Fig . 6 ) is very similar to that reported for COS - 7 cells transfected with rat FAAH , and this pattern has been interpreted to be consistent with endoplasmic and (cid:1) or Golgi localization ( 51 , 52 ) . The observed exclusion of FAAH from the plasma membrane may function to physically separate the activity of anandamide at cannabinoid receptor 1 from its site of hydrolysis . For plasma membrane - bound anandamide to be hydrolyzed , it is required to traverse the aqueous cytoplasm . This process could be accomplished either by diffusing directly through the cytoplasm in a rather inefficient manner to reach FAAH or by binding an unidentified intracellular anandamide binding pro - tein that would serve to increase the solubility of anandamide in the cytoplasmic space . Long - chain fatty acids have been deter - mined to cross a membrane by means of simple diffusion at rates ranging from 0 . 5 to 10 sec ( 29 ) . Diffusion through the cytoplasm , even with the help of a binding protein , would result in a time lag before the start of anandamide metabolism , explaining why hydrolysis is not observed in neuroblastoma cells at 25 sec . Anandamide metabolism driving uptake is supported further by anandamide uptake autoradiography studies in intact goldfish retinal tissue where accumulation of anandamide overlapped with FAAH immunoreactivity ( S . T . G . , D . G . D . , K . M . S . , F . F . , and S . Yazulla , unpublished data ) . Therefore , FAAH activity is the regulative force of anandamide clearance in tissue . In summary , these data portray a simple and efficient system in neuroblastoma and astrocytoma cells for anandamide clearance from the extracellular space independent of a transporter . The lack of saturation and inhibition of uptake indicate that anandamide could be entering cell membranes by means of simple diffusion . Once intracellular , anandamide is subsequently either metabolized by FAAH or sequestered by mechanisms such as binding intracel - lular membranes ( 10 ) . Continuous hydrolysis by FAAH would serve to maintain the concentration gradient necessary to drive the process of simple diffusion . Although this study does not conclu - sively exclude the existence of a transporter , it does examine rates of initial anandamide uptake and suggest a lack of protein medi - ation . These data suggest that metabolism by FAAH is the regu - lating force of anandamide inactivation . We thank Rebecca Rowehl and Lee Ann Silver for help with cell culture and Dr .
