Received : 21 February 2013 ; in revised form : 4 March 2013 / Accepted : 12 March 2013 / Published : 28 March 2013 Abstract : Rho family GTPases belong to the Ras GTPase superfamily and transduce intracellular signals known to regulate a variety of cellular processes , including cell polarity , morphogenesis , migration , apoptosis , vesicle trafficking , viral transport and cellular transformation . The three best - characterized Rho family members are Cdc42 , RhoA and Rac1 . Cdc42 regulates endocytosis , the transport between the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus , post - Golgi transport and exocytosis . Cdc42 influences trafficking through interaction with Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( N - WASP ) and the Arp2 / 3 complex , leading to changes in actin dynamics . Rac1 mediates endocytic and exocytic vesicle trafficking by interaction with its effectors , PI3kinase , synaptojanin 2 , IQGAP1 and phospholipase D1 . RhoA participates in the regulation of endocytosis through controlling its downstream target , Rho kinase .

Importantly , dysregulation of Cdc42 , Rac1 and RhoA leads to numerous disorders , including malignant transformation . In some cases , hyperactivation of Rho GTPases is required for cellular transformation . In this article , we review a number of findings related to Rho GTPase function in intracellular transport and cellular transformation . OPEN ACCESS Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2013 , 14 7090 Keywords : Rho GTPases ; vesicle trafficking ; viral transport ; cellular transformation ; actin cytoskeleton 1 . Introduction The Rho GTPase family , which consists of more than 20 proteins in humans , can be categorized into eight subfamilies according to amino - acid sequence similarities : Rac ( Rac1 , Rac2 , Rac3 and RhoG ) ; Cdc42 ( Cdc42 , TC10 and TCL ) ; CHP and WRCH1 ; RhoH ; Rho BTB ( RhoBTB1 , RhoBTB2 ) ; Rho ( RhoA , RhoB and RhoC ) ; RND ( RND1 , RND2 and RND3 ) ; and Rif ( Rif and RhoD ) [ 1 ] . The members of the four subfamilies ( Rac , Cdc42 , Rho and Rif ) belong to the classical Rho GTPases , while others are parts of the atypical Rho GTPases . Over the past twenty years , Rho GTPases have been implicated in a variety of cellular processes , especially in the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics [ 2 , 3 ] . Extensive studies have focused on the functional analysis of three important Rho GTPase members : Cdc42 , Rac1 and RhoA . Interestingly , recent studies have shown that these Rho GTPases are also involved in cellular trafficking and tumorigenesis . Like other GTPases , the classical Rho GTPases cycle between active GTP - bound forms and inactive GDP - bound forms . There are three types of regulatory proteins that control the GTPase cycle : guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) , GTPase - activating proteins ( GAPs ) and guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors ( GDIs ) [ 4 ] ( Figure 1 ) . GEFs facilitate the release of GDP and the binding of GTP to activate GTPases . GAPs inactivate Rho GTPases by promoting the intrinsic GTP hydrolyzing activity of Rho proteins , resulting in a GDP - bound form . GDIs can bind to C - terminal prenyl groups on some Rho proteins to keep the GTPases in the inactive form [ 5 ] . Through this GTPase cycle , Rho proteins , together with their GEFs , GAPs and GDI regulators , function as molecular switches in the regulation of a wide range of cellular processes , including cell polarity , cellular adhesion , vesicle trafficking , migration , neuronal development , morphogenesis , proliferation , differentiation and transformation [ 6 – 9 ] . Normal temporal and spatial regulation of vesicular transport events is crucial to cell proliferation and apoptosis , as well as the maintenance of homeostasis . For instance , inhibition of brefeldin A ( BFA ) - inhibited GEF2 protein ( BIG2 ) , which is important for vesicular transport , decreases cell proliferation and disturbs the intracellular localization of E - cadherin and β - catenin , thereby influencing human cerebral cortical development [ 10 ] . Deregulation of vesicular transport can lead to decreased capacitive calcium entry , which in turn results in cell apoptosis [ 11 ] . Previous studies have indicated that many Rho GTPases regulate transport pathways , including the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) to the Golgi and endocytic and exocytic transports . In many cases , Rho GTPases play a key role in vesicle trafficking through their ability to regulate the actin cytoskeleton . The Rho GTPases , in an active GTP - bound form , interact with downstream effectors that either directly or indirectly stimulate actin polymerization . Actin plays multiple roles in vesicle trafficking [ 12 – 14 ] . It not only facilitates membrane deformation , cytoskeleton remodeling and the formation of vesicles , but also contributes to vesicle movement and targeting within the cell . Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2013 , 14 7091 Figure 1 . Rho GTPase activity is controlled by guanine nucleotide exchange factor ( GEF ) , GTPase - activating protein ( GAP ) and guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor ( GDI ) . GEF activates Rho GTPases by facilitating the release of GDP and the binding of GTP . GAP inactivates Rho GTPases by promoting hydrolysis of the bound GTP molecules , resulting in their quick change from the GTP - bound form to the GDP - bound form . GDI binds to C - terminal prenyl groups on some Rho proteins , maintaining them in the inactive state . Active Rho GTPases act on their downstream effector proteins , stimulating a variety of cellular processes . Rho Rho GDI Rho GDP GTP GEF GAP Inactive Inactive Active Rho Effectors The best - studied Rho family members are Cdc42 , Rac1 and RhoA in mammalian cells . Activation of Cdc42 helps control cytoskeletal remodeling , establishment of cell polarity , migration , proliferation and transcription by stimulating a variety of signaling cascades [ 15 , 16 ] . In addition , Cdc42 participates in intracellular trafficking and the regulation of malignant transformation , tumor progression and metastasis [ 17 , 18 ] . Rac1 is ubiquitously expressed and involved in signal pathways that regulate mobility and other processes related to membrane trafficking and cell morphology [ 19 , 20 ] . RhoA facilitates the assembly of contractile actomyosin filaments and is associated with focal adhesion complexes . Recently , RhoA has been found to function in vesicle trafficking , tumor invasion and metastasis [ 21 , 22 ] . Other Rho family members , in addition to Cdc42 , Rac1 and RhoA , have also been implicated in vesicle trafficking and cell transformation . TC10 is an important molecule for exocytic processes and interacts with one of the members of the exocyst complex , Exo70 , which is a major player in exocytosis and has been identified as an effector of Cdc42 and Rho3 in yeast [ 23 , 24 ] . It can regulate the trafficking of glucose transporter 4 ( GLUT4 ) and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR ) [ 25 , 26 ] . Since insulin - mediated activation of TC10 promotes the exocytic processes of GLUT4 , it may associate with the development of type 2 diabetes . In human neutrophils , Rac2 can promote primary granule exocytosis through mediating actin cytoskeletal remodeling [ 27 , 28 ] . RhoD is able to link actin reorganization to endosomal vesicle transport [ 29 ] . RhoB not only regulates endocytic trafficking , but also acts as a tumor suppressor . Dominant - negative RhoB ( RhoBN19 and RhoBV14 ) affects postendocytic traffic of ligand - receptor complexes from the basolateral endosomes to apical compartments [ 30 ] . Furthermore , the activated form of RhoB can delay the endocytic trafficking of the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) [ 31 ] . RhoB has also been reported to inhibit tumor growth , cell migration and invasion [ 32 ] , but the mechanism by which it suppresses Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2013 , 14 7092 tumor progression and invasion is still unclear . RhoC has been identified for involvement in tumor metastasis [ 33 ] . Rac1b , a tumor associated and constitutively active Rac1 splice variant , is upregulated in colorectal tumor cell and can promote transformation of NIH3T3 cells [ 34 , 35 ] . In this review , we focus on the trafficking and cancer - related functions of Cdc42 , Rac1 and RhoA in mammalian cells . 2 . Role of Rho GTPases in Vesicular Transport 2 . 1 . Cdc42 : A Regulator of Vesicle Trafficking Cdc42 , a highly conserved small GTPase of the Rho family , was first discovered in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , due to its involvement in the development of cell polarity [ 36 , 37 ] . Since then , Cdc42 has been found to be a molecular switch that modulates a variety of cellular processes in organisms from yeast to mammals , including regulation of actin cytoskeletal architecture and cell polarity , which have been extensively studied . Several studies have implicated Cdc42 in endocytosis , ER / Golgi interface vesicle trafficking , including anterograde ( ER - to - Golgi ) and retrograde ( Golgi - to - ER ) transport , post - Golgi transport and exocytosis ( Figure 2 ) . Figure 2 . Cdc42 , Rac1 and RhoA function in vesicle trafficking . Cdc42 is implicated in endocytosis , trafficking from the cell surface to Golgi region , transport between the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) and Golgi , post - Golgi transport and exocytosis . Rac1 involves in endocytosis and exocytosis , while RhoA mainly takes part in endocytosis . Plasma membrane Golgi Cytoplasm ER Cdc42 Rac1 RhoA Rac1 Cdc42 Cdc42 Cdc42 Cdc42 Cdc42 Nucleus Cdc42 was shown to play a regulatory role in endocytic and secretory pathways , which is important for establishing and maintaining cell polarity [ 38 ] . To maintain the cell polarity , some receptors , which express on the apical or basolateral membranes , must be transported to their appropriate location after endocytosis . It has become clear that actin cytoskeleton plays a role in apical and basolateral traffic in Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2013 , 14 7093 polarized cells , and Rho GTPases regulate the actin dynamics . Thus , Rho GTPases are involved in maintaining cell polarity . In epithelial cells , Cdc42 regulates polarized endocytosis at the basolateral membrane [ 39 ] . Subsequently , Cdc42 has been found to modulate clathrin - dependent endocytosis . Inactivation of Cdc42 by microinjecting a dominant - negative mutant form ( Cdc42 T17N ) inhibits endocytosis in immature dendritic cells , while the constitutively activate Cdc42 mutant ( Cdc42 Q61L ) stimulates endocytosis in mature dendritic cells [ 40 ] . Cdc42 is responsible for the uptake of glycosyl - phosphatidylinositol - anchored proteins ( GPI - APs ) via a clathrin - independent endocytic pathway [ 41 ] . Cdc42 helps direct these lipid anchored proteins into the GPI - AP - enriched early endosomal compartment ( GEEC ) . This process is governed by cholesterol - sensitive Cdc42 - based actin polymerization [ 42 , 43 ] . During endocytosis , Cdc42 interacts with its effector , the Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( N - WASP ) . N - WASP can then bind and activate the actin - related protein 2 / 3 ( Arp2 / 3 ) complex , leading to actin polymerization [ 44 ] . Clathrin - mediated endocytosis involves another Cdc42 effector , called transducer of Cdc42 - dependent actin assembly 1 ( Toca - 1 ) . Toca - 1 has three domains , an F - BAR domain , a Cdc42 binding site and a Src homology 3 ( SH3 ) domain . The Cdc42 binding site contributes to the interaction of Toca - 1 and Cdc42 by facilitating the proper folding of Toca - 1 , while the SH3 domain binds to N - WASP [ 15 ] . Forster resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) experiments have shown that Toca - 1 , Cdc42 and N - WASP form a trimeric complex on membrane tubules and vesicles . Cdc42 facilitates the assembly of the Toca - 1 / N - WASP complex by interacting with N - WASP . An important role for this complex may be to induce the formation of membrane tubules and vesicles [ 45 ] . Cdc42 has been found to affect several distinct steps in intracellular trafficking . The GTPase - defective mutant ( Cdc42 Q61L ) and the dominant negative mutant ( Cdc42 T17N ) both block the transport of glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus ( VSV - G ) from the ER to the Golgi apparatus . By contrast , the Cdc42 F28L mutant , which binds GTP , accelerates the transport of VSV - G from the ER into the Golgi [ 46 ] . In addition , several studies have demonstrated functions for Cdc42 in retrograde trafficking through the secretory pathway . For instance , overexpression and activation of Cdc42 inhibit the retrograde transport of Shiga toxin from the Golgi apparatus to the ER [ 47 ] . Furthermore , activation of Cdc42 or knockdown of ARHGAP21 suppresses the retrograde transport of Shiga toxin from the cell periphery to the juxtanuclear Golgi region [ 48 ] . Activated Cdc42 also regulates export of bone - specific proteins from the Golgi complex to the cell surface in osteoblasts via the GEF faciogenital dysplasia protein ( FGD1 ) [ 49 ] , suggesting that Cdc42 also exerts functions in post - Golgi trafficking . Intracellular membrane trafficking requires the actin cytoskeleton and molecular motor - dependent motility . Because Cdc42 plays a central role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton dynamics , it is possible that Cdc42 exerts its roles in intracellular trafficking through N - WASP / Arp2 / 3 - regulated actin dynamics [ 50 ] . Cdc42 predominantly locates in the Golgi complex in mammalian cells , and it can specifically bind to ARF1 - dependent vesicle - coat protein complex coatomer [ 46 , 51 – 53 ] . The coatomer / Cdc42 complex recruits N - WASP and Arp2 / 3 to the Golgi membrane . Importantly , p23 ( a COOH - terminal dilysine motif on the putative cargo receptor ) competes with Cdc42 for binding to γ COP . Once the interaction between Cdc42 and COPI is disrupted by p23 , dynein is recruited to Golgi membranes to promote dynein - dependent vesicle transport . This implies that Cdc42 may help coordinate actin and microtubule - dependent motility events in the secretory pathway . Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2013 , 14 7094 Interestingly , the signal pathway of Cdc42 / N - WASP / Arp2 / 3 facilitates protein export by inducing production of actin filaments at the site of exocytosis . A constitutively active Cdc42 mutant can increase exocytosis in chromaffin and PC12 cells [ 54 ] . The neuronal guanine nucleotide exchange factor ( intersectin - 1L ) , one isoform of the intersectin - 1 protein , enhances secretagogue - induced activation of Cdc42 . Activated Cdc42 recruits N - WASP to the subplasmalemmal region to activate Arp2 / 3 . The increased actin polymerization helps bring granules to the docking sites on the plasma membrane [ 55 ] . 2 . 2 . Rac1 : Involvement in Endocytic and Exocytic Transport Rac1 , Ras - related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 , is the best - characterized member of the Rac subfamily ( including Rac1 , Rac2 , Rac3 and RhoG ) . Previous studies found that Rac1 regulates a diverse array of cellular events , including the formation of lamellipodia and membrane ruffles , cell cycle , cell adhesion and mobility [ 21 ] . In addition , Rac1 regulates endocytic and exocytic trafficking pathways [ 19 ] ( Figure 2 ) . Unlike Cdc42 , Rac1 has not been characterized to participate in the early secretory pathway , nor has it been shown to regulate membrane trafficking at the ER / Golgi interface . Consistent with its function , Rac1 is not located in the Golgi complex [ 56 ] . Rac1 has played a characterized role in clathrin - dependent endocytosis [ 57 ] . Activation of Rac1 , when expressed in intact cells , blocks transferrin - receptor - mediated endocytosis . One mechanism through which Rac1 regulates clathrin - mediated endocytosis is by modulating phosphatidylinositol - 3 kinase ( PI3K ) and synaptojanin 2 ( a polyphosphoinositide phosphatase ) . PI3K , a member of the phosphatidylinositol 4 - phosphate 5 - kinase family , is an upstream regulator of Rac1 . PIP2 is phosphorylated by PI3K to generate PIP3 , which induces the activation of Rac1 guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) to regulate actin rearrangement and vesicular trafficking in various cell types [ 58 ] . Recently , P - Rex1 , the PI3K - dependent Rac exchange factor , has been identified as a novel regulator of the glucose transporter ( GLUT4 ) trafficking in adipocytes . PIP3 and βγ subunits of heterotrimeric G - proteins can synergistically activate P - Rex1 [ 59 ] . P - Rex1 activates Rac1 to stimulate actin polymerization and facilitate GLUT4 transport to the plasma membrane [ 60 ] . Synaptojanin 2 , a novel Rac1 effector , can interact with Rac1 directly and specifically [ 61 ] . This interaction decreases the formation of coated pits , thereby inhibiting endocytosis . Recent studies have indicated that activated Rac1 inhibits the endocytosis of E - cadherin through the F - actin cross - linking protein , Ras GTPase - activating - like protein IQGAP1 ( IQGAP1 ) , one of its downstream targets . After being activated by trans - interacting E - cadherin , Rac1 can bind to IQGAP1 , and then IQGAP1 cross - links F - actin into actin bundles , which inhibits the endocytosis of E - cadherin [ 62 ] . Moreover , Rac1 modulates ARF6 - mediated clathrin - independent endocytosis through phosphatidydependentinositol - 4 - phosphate5 - kinase ( PIP5K ) . PIP5K binds to the polybasic region ( PBR ) binding domain of Rac1 , whereas calmodulin ( CaM ) interacts with Rac1 through both the PBR and an adjacent prenyl group . Thus , CaM can disrupt the interaction between Rac1 and PIP5K through steric hindrance . Inhibition of CaM increases the Rac1 / PIP5K binding interaction [ 63 ] . This interaction is essential for retaining PIP5K at the plasma membrane and for the synthesis of PIP2 , which regulates actin dynamics [ 64 ] . Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2013 , 14 7095 Rac1 has also been reported to regulate calcium - dependent exocytosis in some cells . For instance , a late step of Ca 2 + - dependent neurotransmitter release is regulated by Rac1 in rat brain synaptosomes [ 65 ] . Rac1 can be associated with highly purified synaptic vesicles and is involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter release . Rac1 activation increases secretion in bovine chromaffin cells [ 66 ] and participates in cholecystokinin ( CCK ) - induced amylase release in pancreatic acinar cells [ 67 ] . Early studies indicated that the role of Rac1 in exocytosis is possibly relevant to forming actin - based membrane ruffles [ 68 ] . Rac1 redirects the exocytosis of recycling membranes into the sites of ruffle formation . However , the regulatory effects of Rac1 on the calcium - regulated exocytosis might rely on modulating the activity of phospholipase D1 ( PLD1 ) . PLD1 plays a major role in late steps of the exocytotic pathway [ 69 ] . As an upstream regulator of PLD1 , Rac1 could strongly stimulate PLD1 activation and increase the level of phosphatidic acid ( PA ) at the plasma membrane [ 70 ] . The precise mechanisms of Rac1 in exocytosis will require further investigation . 2 . 3 . RhoA Mainly Participates in the Regulation of Endocytic Transport The Rho subfamily of GTPases currently consists of three members : RhoA , RhoB and RhoC . Although these isoforms are highly homologous ( RhoA and RhoB share 84 % amino acid sequence identity ; RhoA and RhoC share 92 % amino acid sequence identity [ 1 ] ) , they have strikingly different functions in cells . These distinct functions result from C - terminal sequence divergence among RhoA , RhoB and RhoC , which affects their localization . RhoA and RhoC are localized in the cytoplasm or at the plasma membrane , whereas RhoB is localized primarily on late endosomes , lysosomes and the plasma membranes . Recently , the functions of these Rho isoforms have extensively studied . RhoA has the remarkable ability to regulate actin polymerization , cell adhesion , actomyosin contractility , cellular transformation , activation of transcription and endocytosis [ 7 , 71 ] . RhoB plays a critical role in cytokine trafficking and cell survival , while RhoC may be able to regulate cell motility [ 21 , 72 ] . Here , we focus on explaining how RhoA regulates endocytosis . RhoA helps direct endocytosis in a variety of cell types ( Figure 2 ) . For example , inactivated RhoA can reduce the uptake of oligomeric A β 42 in N2A cells as part of the mechanism to defend cells from oligomeric A β 42 - induced neurotoxicity [ 73 ] . Activated RhoA inhibits transferrin - receptor - mediated endocytosis in Hela cells [ 57 ] , the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors trafficking to the plasma membrane in HEK293 cells [ 74 ] and the uptake of fetuin - A in bovine vascular smooth muscle cells [ 75 ] . By contrast , RhoA promotes the endocytosis of interleukin 2 receptors in L αβγ cells [ 76 ] and compensatory endocytosis in umbrella cells [ 77 ] . Activated RhoA may affect endocytosis by recruiting the Rho - associated coiled coil - containing protein kinases ( ROCKs ) to rearrange actin cytoskeleton . The actin cytoskeleton is a highly dynamic structure that promotes the invagination of apical membranes through conjugating myosin motors . As the major downstream effectors of RhoA , ROCKs are involved in two signaling pathways that reorganize the actin cytoskeleton . ROCKs inhibit the myosin light chain phosphatase ( MLCP ) activity by phosphorylating the myosin binding subunit of MLCP and then increasing the phosphorylation of MLC , thereby enhancing myosin II activity , stress - fiber formation and cellular contraction [ 78 ] . Moreover , the ROCK / LIM kinase ( LIMK ) signaling pathway inactivates cofilin , an actin depolymerization Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2013 , 14 7096 factor , resulting in the stabilization of F - actin and the increase of actomyosin contractility [ 79 ] . Suppressing the actin - filament severing activity of cofilin leads to stress - fiber formation [ 80 ] . Some upstream regulators of RhoA , including PI3K , focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) , GC - binding factor 2 ( GCF2 ) and GTPase regulator associated with focal adhesion kinase - 1 ( GRAF1 ) , have been reported to participate in endocytosis and membrane protein trafficking by regulating RhoA activation . Treatment with the PI3K inhibitor ( LY294002 ) or the FAK inhibitor ( PF573228 ) suppresses compensatory endocytosis by ~ 30 % and ~ 70 % , respectively , by inhibiting the activation of RhoA and then reducing the recruitment of ROCK [ 77 ] . Increasing expression of the transcription repressor , GCF2 , can silence RhoA expression , leading to actin cytoskeleton disorganization . This increases the internalization of multidrug resistance - associated protein - 1 ( MRP1 ) into cytoplasm [ 81 ] . GRAF1 participates indirectly in membrane sculpting via regulating RhoA activity . The N - terminal BAR and PH domains of GRAF1 localize GRAF1 to membrane tubular structures , [ 82 , 83 ] . Thus , GRAF1 work together with RhoA in directing changes in membrane morphology during endocytosis . Interestingly , some GAPs and GEFs affect exocytosis by regulating RhoA activity . For instance , GEF - H1 , a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for RhoA , can interact with the exocyst component , Sec5 . This interaction facilitates RhoA activation , which in turn influences the exocytic trafficking from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane by regulating the assembly and localization of exocyst protein , Exo70 [ 84 ] . Gem - interacting protein ( GMIP ) , a RhoA GTPase - activating protein , binds to the secretory factor , JFC1 , to orchestrate actin remodeling near secretory organelles by mediating RhoA inactivation and then inducing exocytosis [ 85 ] . 3 . Rho GTPases Regulate Viral Proteins and Genome Transport in Host Cells Given that Cdc42 , Rac1 and RhoA are responsible for regulation of host cell protein trafficking , it has been proposed that they play an important role in the intracellular transport of viral proteins and genome . Our previous studies have indicated that Cdc42 and its specific GAP ARHGAP21 are both involved in the transport of influenza A virus neuraminidase ( NA ) protein . Expression of constitutively active Cdc42 or silencing ARHGAP21 facilitates the transport of NA to the plasma membranes , while expressing shRNA targeting Cdc42 or overexpressing ARHGAP21 significantly decreases the amount of cell surface - localized NA , according to immunofluorescence and NA activity assay [ 86 ] . Cdc42 also associates with the influenza A virus matrix protein 1 ( M1 ) , and this interaction probably contributes to virus budding [ 87 ] . In addition to influenza A virus , previous studies revealed that Cdc42 , Rac1 and RhoA participate in the lifecycle of multiple viruses . For example , the endocytosis of adenovirus ( Ad ) and adeno - associated virus type 2 ( AAV - 2 ) involves Cdc42 and Rac1 [ 88 – 90 ] . The internalization of Japanese encephalitis virus ( JEV ) needs the help of RhoA [ 91 ] . Cdc42 and Rac1 exert influence early in herpes simplex virus type 1 ( HSV - 1 ) infection after the viruses enters the host cells [ 92 ] . RhoA is implicated in the trafficking of Kaposi’s sarcoma - associated herpes virus ( KSHV ) DNA to the cell nucleus [ 93 , 94 ] . The release of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV - 1 ) and Marburg virus ( MARV ) particles from infected cells is also strongly influenced by RhoA and Cdc42 , respectively [ 95 , 96 ] . The processes of viral endocytosis , intracellular trafficking and exocytosis in the host cells are mostly associated with Rho GTPase - regulated cytoskeletal dynamics . Treatment with CdTB Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2013 , 14 7097 ( a chemical inhibitor of Rho GTPases ) disrupts actin dynamics and prevents the internalization and trafficking of KSHV to the nucleus in human umbilical vein endothelial cells . Wiskostatin ( an inhibitor of N - WASP ) has similar effects . These suggest that the regulation of actin dynamics through the Rho GTPase / N - WASP / Arp2 / 3 pathway has an essential role in KSHV entry and trafficking in endothelial cells [ 97 ] . In addition , dynamic polymerization of actin in filopodia upon overexpression of Cdc42 promotes the release of MARV particles [ 96 ] . Rho GTPases are involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics and , thus , facilitate the transport of viral pathogens in infected cells and the release of newly assembled virus progeny from host cells . It has been shown that microtubule motors were involved in regulating African swine fever virus ( ASFV ) entry to host cell and the trafficking of virions to the plasma membrane . Of interest , during the early stages of ASFV infection , activated Rac1 regulates microtubule dynamics by acetylating tubulin , leading to changes in ASFV intracellular transport [ 98 ] . RhoA - mDia regulated microtubule dynamics affect viral DNA trafficking in KSHV - infected cells and vaccinia virus release into the media . When infected with KSHV , the RhoA - dependent activation of Dia2 is enhanced in HFF cells [ 93 ] . Activated Dia2 directly binds to microtubules and controls their assembly dynamics . This promotes viral DNA transport to the cell nucleus [ 99 ] . Besides , dynein motors also play a role in the cytoplasmic trafficking of KSHV and the transport of its DNA to the nucleus [ 93 ] . Vaccinia virus F11L protein interacts with RhoA to inhibit the RhoA - ROCK and RhoA - mDia signaling . This is responsible for viral morphogenesis , increased peripheral microtubule dynamics and reorganization of cortical actin , thereby promoting vaccinia virus particle release from infected cells [ 100 – 102 ] . 4 . Cdc42 , Rac1 and RhoA Contribute to Cellular Transformation and Regulate Tumor Invasion and Metastasis Malignant cellular transformation is a complex multifaceted process . Precise spatial and temporal regulation of vesicle trafficking by Cdc42 , Rac1 and RhoA is important for cell survival and function and , hence , contribute to cellular transformation . Perturbation of Cdc42 , Rac1 and RhoA activity results in the loss of normal physiological function and can be related to the pathological conditions , including cellular transformation , tumor invasion and metastasis . The relationship between Cdc42 , Rac1 or RhoA and cellular transformation has been extensively studied during the past ten years . This work indicates that hyperactivation of Cdc42 , Rac1 or RhoA can lead to cellular transformation . The cycle between GDP - and GTP - bound states of GTPase is critical for the transforming potential of Cdc42 , Rac1 and RhoA [ 103 , 104 ] . The spontaneously activated ( so - called “fast - cycling” ) mutants of Cdc42 , Rac1 and RhoA that facilitate the intrinsic nucleotide exchange rate , but still exhibit normal GTP hydrolytic activity , can mediate cellular transformation induced by the Dbl oncoprotein in NIH3T3 cells [ 105 ] . Cdc42 activation can enhance anchorage - independent cell growth by boosting filopodia formation and generating large , multinucleated cells . RhoA activation results in the loss of contact inhibition and the increase of stress fiber and focal adhesion complexes . Rac1 activation enhances the accumulation of cortical actin at the cell periphery [ 105 ] . Specific GAPs can inhibit the activation of Cdc42 , Rac1 and RhoA by increasing intrinsic GTPase activity , leading to suppression of tumor formation . For example , deletion of liver cancer 1 ( DLC - 1 ) , a Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2013 , 14 7098 RhoA and Cdc42 - specific GAP , inhibits the growth of various types of cancer , including lung , breast , prostate , kidney , colon , uterus , ovary and stomach through altering the actin cytoskeleton [ 106 , 107 ] . Ankyrin repeat and pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domain 3 ( ARAP3 ) , a specific Rho GAP of Cdc42 , Rac1 and RhoA , has been reported to inhibit peritoneal dissemination of scirrhous gastric carcinoma cells [ 106 , 108 ] . The functions of Rho GDIs in cellular transformation are very complex [ 104 ] and need further investigation . In some cases , Rho GDIs are thought to inhibit Rho GTPases activation and function as tumor suppressors . Knocking down of RhoGDI1 can promote cancer cell metastasis via inducing RhoA activation [ 109 ] . Clinical evidence indicates that RhoGDI2 is a metastasis suppressor in bladder cancer [ 110 ] . However , Rho GDIs may not simply inhibit tumor cell metastasis , but also be required for cellular transformation . One study has shown that the interaction between Cdc42 and RhoGDI is essential for Cdc42 - mediated cellular transformation . NIH 3T3 cells expressing the Cdc42 ( F28L , R66A ) double mutant , which is ineffective in binding to RhoGDI , fails to proliferate in low ( 1 % ) concentrations of serum and form colonies in soft agar , suggesting that RhoGDI could be involved in cellular transformation [ 111 ] . Cdc42 , Rac1 and RhoA have the ability to promote cellular transformation , not only due to their own aberrant activation , but also due to their ability to modify oncoproteins , such as Ras , EGFR and sarcoma ( Src ) . Early studies have revealed that Ras - dependent transformation requires functional Cdc42 , Rac1 and RhoA [ 112 – 115 ] . These Rho GTPases can impinge on Ras - induced signaling pathways . For example , Cdc42 and Rac1 activate PI3K through indirect cooperative positive feedback [ 116 ] . Fibroblast growth factor - 2 ( FGF - 2 ) - induced activation of Ras / mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) signaling and c - Jun N - terminal kinase ( JNK ) activation require Rac1 activity in human breast cell line MCF7 [ 117 ] . The p21 - activated kinases ( PAKs ) , downstream effectors of Cdc42 , bind to activated Cdc42 and Rac1 to activate various downstream signaling cascades . This regulates cancer progression by promoting cell proliferation , survival , motility and angiogenesis [ 118 , 119 ] . EGFR is often overexpressed or abnormally activated to activate mitogenic signaling pathways in tumor progression . Activation of Cdc42 can prevent EGFR degradation to sustain EGFR signaling and then promote cellular transformation through interacting with c - Cbl , which plays a role in the initiation of EGFR degradation [ 120 ] . In addition , Cdc42 may further regulate EGFR - mediated transformation by altering its cellular trafficking . RhoA and ROCK have been shown to negatively regulate EGFR endocytosis . The active form of ROCK can phosphorylate endophilin A1 at Thr - 14 and then affect the recruitment of endophilin A1 to the EGFR - c - Cbl - CIN85 complex , leading to the reduction of EGFR endocytosis [ 121 , 122 ] . Similarly , Cdc42 , Rac1 and RhoA play roles in cellular transformation mediated by Src [ 123 ] . For instance , mDia1 , a downstream effector of Rho , is essential for v - Src - induced cellular transformation . Previous studies have shown that v - Src - induced transformation and podosome formation are inhibited in mDia1 - deficient cells [ 124 ] . This can be explained by the fact that mDia1 deficiency decreases the levels of several tyrosine - phosphorylated proteins , most of which are high molecular mass proteins ( 100 to 250 kDa ) , in v - Src - transformed cells . Subsequently , the translocation of v - Src from the perinuclear region to the cell periphery is impaired , leading to the downregulation of downstream signaling pathways . This ultimately results in the suppression of v - Src - induced cell transformation [ 124 ] . Transformed cells exhibit invasive and metastatic properties and the capacity to form invadopodia at the leading edge , which is regulated by actin cytoskeleton reorganization [ 125 ] . Cdc42 is thought to Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2013 , 14 7099 be important for invadopodia formation , due to induction of actin polymerization via activating the N - WASP / Arp2 / 3 pathway [ 126 ] . N - WASP and the Arp2 / 3 complex are specifically localized at invadopodia and are essential for invadopodia formation in carcinoma cells . Treatment with N - WASP siRNA or transfection with a N - WASP dominant - negative mutant ( lacking the sequence that is required for binding to the Arp2 / 3 complex ) could reduce invadopodia formation in MTLn3 cells [ 126 ] . The precise function of N - WASP in invadopodia formation may be related to its ability to promote the assembly of actin filaments through interacting with the Arp2 / 3 complex or increasing the internalization of degraded matrix components and the recycling of the invadopodia components [ 127 ] . In addition , it has been shown that the presence of Rac1 inhibitor , NSC23766 , blocks invadopodia formation and matrix degradation [ 128 ] . The downstream effector of Rac1 , WAVE2 , is an important regulator of melanoma invasion and is involved in metastasis . Both enhanced Rac1 activation and increased WAVE2 expression synergistically contribute to B16F10 cell invasion [ 129 ] . Moreover , RhoA can also promote tumor cell invasion through regulating invadopodia formation . Inhibition of RhoA activity with C3 or transfection with dominant - negative RhoA mutant disrupts F - actin accumulation and invadopodia formation [ 130 ] . The RhoA effectors , ROCKs and formins , both also have an effect on invadopodia formation . Inhibition of ROCK with specific siRNA reduces invadopodia and decreases tumor cell invasion and knockdown of Dia1 , - 2 or - 3 can inhibit the formation of invadopodia and invasion capacity of MDA - MB - 231 cells [ 131 , 132 ] . Taken together , these data suggest that Cdc42 , Rac1 and RhoA are all closely associated with the invasion and metastasis of tumor cells through regulating the formation of invadopodia . 5 . Conclusions Because Rho GTPases intimately participate in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton , they play key roles in various physiological and pathological processes , including intracellular transport and tumor progression from transformation to metastasis ( Figure 3 ) . Extensive studies have revealed the pleiotropic effects of Cdc42 , Rac1 and RhoA on vesicle trafficking . Although each of them has a specific role , parts of their functions are often overlapping , such as regulating endocytosis . Cdc42 promotes endocytosis through regulation of the Cdc42 / Toca - 1 / N - WASP / Arp2 / 3 signaling pathway . Rac1 functions in endocytosis by controlling PI3K , synaptojanin 2 , IQGAP1 or being involved in Arf6 - dependent endocytosis . ROCK plays a crucial role in the RhoA - induced endocytosis . Increasing evidence suggests that there may exist cross talk between the Rho GTPases . However , the precise mechanisms by which signals from these different Rho GTPases are coordinated remain unknown . In light of previous work , one can conclude that there are cross effects between vesicle trafficking and cellular transformation mediated by Cdc42 , Rac1 and RhoA . The fact that the two cellular events share the same effectors might explain the phenomenon described above . For example , as a target of Cdc42 , COPI can regulate Cdc42 - mediated vesicle trafficking and cellular transformation simultaneously [ 46 , 51 ] . Cdc42 mutants that are unable to bind γ COP affect both trafficking of VSV - G from the ER to the Golgi apparatus and cellular transformation [ 46 ] . The role of ROCK in regulating RhoA - induced endocytosis and cellular transformation has also been documented . Treatment with the ROCK inhibitor , Y - 27632 , could reduce actin stress fibers , disrupt endocytosis and impair the Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2013 , 14 7100 transforming activity of RhoA . However , how Rac1 effectors play roles in both vesicle trafficking and cellular transformation still needs to be determined . Figure 3 . Involvement of Cdc42 , Rac1 and RhoA in vesicle trafficking , cellular transformation , invadopodia formation and metastasis . Cdc42 regulates vesicle trafficking and invadopodia formation through Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( N - WASP ) - mediated Arp2 / 3 signaling pathway . Rac1 has an effect on endocytosis and exocytosis via acting on its downstream effectors , including synaptojanin 2 , IQGAP1 , PIP5K and PLD1 , and is involved in metastasis through its downstream molecule , WAVE2 . RhoA activates its major downstream effector , Rho - associated coiled coil - containing protein kinases ( ROCK ) , to modulate endocytosis and invadopodia formation through affecting actin dynamics . Hyperactivation of Cdc42 , Rac1 or RhoA can result in cellular transformation .

In the future , more precise investigation of the regulatory roles of the “classical” and “nonclassical” members of the Rho GTPases family will yield additional fascinating insights .
