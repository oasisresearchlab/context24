Abstract . Background / Aim : The incidence and mortality rates of prostate cancer have been increasing worldwide . Although prostate cancer cells grow slowly in the local original site , once the cancer cells spread to distant organs they grow rapidly and show very aggressive features . Cortactin is a protein that regulates the actin cytoskeleton and plays crucial roles in cancer metastasis . Up - regulated cortactin is correlated with the metastatic capacity of prostate cancer cells . AHCC ® , a standardized extract of cultured Lentinula edodes mycelia , has been previously reported to have cortactin - down - regulating effects on human pancreatic cancer cells . In the present study , the effects of AHCC ® treatment on cortactin levels in prostate cancer cells was evaluated . Materials and Methods : LNCaP . FGC , DU145 , and PC - 3 are human prostate cancer cell lines . LNCaP . FGC is well differentiated , androgen - dependent , and poorly metastatic . DU145 is less differentiated , androgen - independent , and moderate metastatic . PC - 3 is less differentiated , androgen - independent , and highly metastatic . The effects of AHCC ® treatment on cortactin levels in prostate cancer cells was evaluated by western blot . Results : In vitro AHCC ® treatment decreased cortactin levels in LNCaP . FGC and DU145 cells but did not change those in PC - 3 cells . Conclusion : AHCC ® treatment down - regulated cortactin expression in poor and moderate metastatic LNCaP . FGC and DU145 cells but showed no effect on cortactin expression in the highly metastatic PC - 3 cells . Further studies are required to elucidate the mechanism of the resistance to AHCC ® treatment in highly metastatic PC - 3 cells . The incidence and mortality of prostate cancer ( PC ) in Japan is not as high as in Western countries . However , in the recent past , patients with prostate cancer have been increasing in Japan ( 1 ) . Globally , PC is the 2 nd most diagnosed cancer and the 6 th leading cause of cancer - related mortality in men . Approximately 1 , 300 , 000 new cases of prostate cancer resulted in 360 , 000 deaths in 2018 ( 2 ) . For the diagnosis of prostate cancer , prostate - specific antigen ( PSA ) test is broadly used for screening . PSA is a glycoprotein that is normally produced in prostatic epithelial cells . However , up - regulated PSA is often detected in men without prostate cancer tissues . Therefore , a prostatic tissue biopsy is required for the diagnosis . In early stages of prostate cancer almost all patients are asymptomatic , but in later stages the patients have repeated urination , nocturia , hematuria , urinary retention , and painful urination . Although prognosis of patients with localized prostate cancer is generally good after treatment , once prostate cancer cells metastasize to distant organs including bones , lymph nodes , and lungs they become aggressive ( 3 - 6 ) . The standard treatments for prostate cancer patients at early stages are active surveillance , prostatectomy , and radiotherapy . Hormonal therapy is applied to patients in advanced stages ( 7 - 9 ) . Prostate cancer cells consume androgens for their growth , mortality , and survival . Blocking of androgens is effective for prostate cancer therapy . However , the prostate cancer cells with genomic mutations in the androgen receptor are resistant to hormonal therapy , and patients with such types of prostate cancer have a poor prognosis ( 10 ) . 1159 * These Authors contributed equally to this work .

Usually , when prostate cancer is diagnosed , a distant metastasis is also found . Normally , prostate cancer grows slowly in the local original site . However , when prostate cancer cells metastasize in distant organs , it becomes aggressive . Cortactin is a Src kinase substrate protein that regulates the actin cytoskeleton . Cortactin shows multiple functions , such as actin polymerization , the formation of cell motility structures , and extracellular matrix - protein deposition . In addition , cortactin has been shown to play an important role in tumor metastasis and its over - expression is associated with enhanced cancer migration and invasion ( 11 ) . Furthermore , cortactin has been reported to be up - regulated in various cancers including head and neck , esophageal , gastric , colorectal , hepatoma , breast , and ovarian cancers ( 12 - 18 ) . Moreover , cortactin up - regulation has been shown to correlate with poor prognosis ( 19 ) . LNCaP . FGC , DU145 , and PC - 3 are human prostate cancer cell lines . LNCaP . FGC is a well differentiated androgen - dependent cell line . DU145 and PC - 3 are less differentiated androgen - independent cell lines . LNCaP . FGC is poorly metastatic , DU145 is moderate metastatic , and PC - 3 is highly metastatic ( 20 - 24 ) . The relationship between prostate cancer and cortactin was assessed in in vitro studies . Nakane et al . used human prostate cancer cell lines and reported that cortactin was up - regulated in DU145 cells more than LNCaP and PC - 3 cells . They also reported that knockdown of cortactin prevented both migration and invasion of DU145 cells ( 25 ) . Ma et al . reported that expression of cortactin was correlated with the migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells ( 26 ) . Therefore , it is suggested that the regulation of cortactin in prostate cancer cells is important for the treatment of patients with prostate cancer . AHCC ® is a standardized extract of cultured Lentinula edodes mycelia , which is derived from the basidiomycete mushroom Lentinula edodes . AHCC ® is composed of polysaccharides , amino acids , lipids , and minerals . AHCC ® has been reported to have immunomodulatory and antitumor effects ( 27 ) . We previously showed that AHCC ® down - regulated cortactin in human gemcitabine - resistant pancreatic cancer KLM1 - R cells and inhibited their migration in vitro ( 11 ) . Turner and Chaudhary showed a case report about a patient with metastatic castration - resistant prostate cancer treated with AHCC ® . The PSA levels of this patient showed an excellent decrease after AHCC ® treatment ( 28 ) . The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of AHCC ® treatment on the expression of cortactin in prostate cancer cells .

Mixture F - 12 medium ( Fuji film - Wako , Tokyo , Japan ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum at 37˚C in a CO 2 incubator . Preparation of AHCC ® . AHCC ® was kindly provided by Amino Up Co . , Ltd . ( Sapporo , Japan ) . AHCC ® was dissolved in DMEM / F12 medium ( 10 mg / ml ) and filtered before application ( 11 ) . Western blot analysis . LNCaP . FGC , DU145 , and PC - 3 cells were treated with AHCC ® ( 10 mg / ml ) or cyclodextrin ( 10 mg / ml ) as a control for 48 h in vitro , and proteins were extracted from the cells by using lysis buffer [ 50 mM Tris HCl , pH 7 . 5 ; 10 mM EDTA , pH 7 . 5 ; 165 mM NaCl ; 10 mM NaF ; 1 % Nonidet P - 40 ; 1 mM PMSF ; 1 mM NaVO 3 ; 10 μg / ml leupeptin ; and 10 μg / ml aprotinin ] . The lysates were centrifuged ( 10 , 500× g , 30 min , 4˚C ) , and the supernatant was used as a sample . Fifteen micrograms of the protein samples were used for western blot . In pre - cast gels ( 4 - 0 % gradient of polyacrylamide ; Mini - PROTEAN TGX Gels ; Bio - Rad , Hercules , CA , USA ) sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS - PAGE ) was carried out . The gels were transferred electrophoretically onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes ( Immobilon - P ; Millipore , Bedford , MA , USA ) and blocked with Tris - buffered saline with 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 solution ( TBS - T ) containing 5 % skimmed milk overnight at 4˚C . After washing the following primary antibodies were used : rabbit monoclonal antibody against cortactin ( dilution 1 : 1 , 000 , # CST3502 ; Cell Signaling Technology , Beverly , MA , USA ) and rabbit monoclonal antibody against β - actin ( dilution 1 : 5000 , # 20536 - 1 - AP ; Proteintech Group , Inc . , Rosemont , IL , USA ) . Membranes were incubated with the primary antibody overnight at 4˚C . After washing the membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase - conjugated secondary antibody ( dilution 1 : 10 , 000 ; Jackson Immuno - Research Laboratories Inc . , West Grove , PA , USA ) for 1 h at room temperature . Bands of cortactin and β - actin were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence system ( Clarity™ Western ECL Substrate ; Bio - Rad ) and LuminoGraph I ( ATTO Corporation , Tokyo , Japan ) and recorded using ImageSaver6 software ( ATTO Corporation ) . By using CS Analyzer4 software ( ATTO Corporation ) , the intensity of each band of cortactin and β - actin were quantified . Each experiment was performed in triplicate . Data are expressed as mean±standard deviation ( SD ) of the target protein ratio to actin protein ( 11 ) . Statistical analysis . All data are expressed as the mean±standard deviation ( SD ) . Statistical significance was defined at p < 0 . 05 . Results Cortactin was expressed in PC - 3 , DU145 and LNCap . FGC cells . Western blot analysis with primary antibodies against cortactin and β - actin for the intracellular proteins of LNCaP . FGC , DU145 , and PC - 3 cells was performed . The protein bands of cortactin ( 80 kDa ) are shown in all cell lines ( Figure 1 ) . AHCC ® treatment down - regulated cortactin protein levels in LNCaP . FGC and DU145 cells . Since cortactin has been reported to contribute to carcinogenesis , migration , invasion , and metastasis in prostate cancer ( 25 ) , we investigated the effect of AHCC ® on the cortactin expression in LNCaP . FGC , DU145 , and PC - 3 cells . The protein expression of cortactin was down - regulated by AHCC ® - treatment ( 10 mg / ml ) in LNCaP . FGC cells compared to the cyclodextrin - treated ( 10 mg / ml ; control ) cells ( Figure 2A ) . The intensity of cortactin normalized by β - actin in AHCC ® - treated LNCaP . FGC cells was 0 . 285 + 0 . 164 , and that in control - treated cells was 0 . 941 + 0 . 273 . This normalized intensity was significantly weaker in the AHCC ® - treated LNCaP . FGC cells compared to the control - treated cells ( p = 0 . 005 by Student’s t - test ) ( Figure 2B ) . These results suggested that cortactin was down - regulated by AHCC ® - treatment in vitro . The protein expression of cortactin was down - regulated by AHCC ® - treatment in DU145 cells compared to the control - treated cells . However , the down - regulating effect of AHCC ® - treatment on DU145 cells was lower compared to that on LNCaP . FGC cells ( Figure 3A ) . The intensity of cortactin normalized by β - actin in the AHCC ® - treated DU145 cells was 0 . 192 + 0 . 201 , and that in the control - treated cells was 0 . 573 + 0 . 422 . This normalized intensity was significantly weaker in the AHCC ® - treated DU145 cells compared to that in control - treated cells ( p = 0 . 019 by Student’s t - test ) , but the down - regulating effect of AHCC ® - treatment was weaker than that on LNCaP . FGC cells ( Figure 3B ) . AHCC ® treatment did not decrease cortactin protein levels in PC - 3 cells . The protein expression of cortactin in PC - 3 cells was not changed by AHCC ® - treatment compared to control - treated cells ( Figure 4A ) . The intensity of cortactin normalized by β - actin in AHCC ® - treated PC - 3 cells was 1 . 505 + 0 . 868 , and that in the control - treated cells was 1 . 767 + 0 . 743 . This normalized intensity was not different in the AHCC ® - treated and control - treated cells ( p = 0 . 131 by Student’s t - test ) ( Figure 4B ) . These results suggested that the AHCC ® - treatment had no effect on cortactin - expression in PC - 3 cells in vitro . Discussion In the present study , we demonstrated that cortactin was expressed in three prostate cancer cell lines , PC - 3 , DU145 , and LNCaP . FGC cells , and in vitro treatment with AHCC ® significantly down - regulated cortactin protein levels in LNCaP . FGC and DU145 cells but did not change the levels in PC - 3 cells . Cortactin is one of the key molecules involved in cancer progression , including metastasis and invasion . The up - regulated cortactin levels in various types of cancers has been reported ( 12 - 18 ) and is correlated with poor prognosis of many kinds of cancers ( 19 ) . In prostate cancer cells , cortactin plays important roles in migration , invasion , and metastasis ( 25 , 26 ) . Nakane et al . reported that inhibition of cortactin by knock - down attenuated migration and invasion of DU145 cells . They also found that SIRT1 colocalized and interacted with cortactin in the cytoplasm . Since the silencing of SIRT1 A NTICANCER R ESEARCH 43 : 1159 - 1166 ( 2023 ) 1164 Yamashita et al : Cortactin Is Down - regulated in AHCC ® - treated Prostate Cancer Cells 1165 also inhibited migration and invasion of DU145 cells , the interaction of SIRT1 with cortactin may play important roles in the metastasis of prostate cancer cells ( 25 ) . Ma et al . analyzed prostate cancer tissues and showed that cortactin levels increased gradually in different stages of malignant progression and was associated with metastasis . They knocked - down cortactin in PC - 3 cells and analyzed invasion and gelatin degradation ability . Silencing of cortactin in PC - 3 cells attenuated invasive ability and extracellular matrix degradation ( 26 ) . From these reports , it is clear that cortactin plays important roles on the malignant progression of prostate cancer cells . Therefore , it is important to regulate the expression of cortactin in prostate cancer cells . The present study showed the down - regulating effect of AHCC ® on the expression of cortactin in prostate cancer cell lines , LNCaP . FGC and DU145 cells . However , AHCC ® treatment was not effective οn PC - 3 cells . Currently , the reason why AHCC ® treatment is not effective οn PC - 3 is unclear . The spontaneous expression of cortactin in PC - 3 was not too strong compared to that in LNCaP . FGC and DU145 cells ( Figure 1 ) . Nakane et al . showed that the protein level of cortactin was significantly higher in DU145 cells compared to that in PC - 3 and LNCaP cells ( 25 ) . Thus , the over - expression of cortactin may not cause resistance to AHCC ® treatment . LNCaP . FGC cells are androgen - dependent , but PC - 3 and DU145 cells are androgen - independent ( 29 ) . LNCaP . FGC cells are well - differentiated and poorly metastatic . DU - 145 cells are less - differentiated and moderately metastatic . PC - 3 cells are less - differentiated and highly metastatic ( 22 ) . PC - 3 cells are the most malignant of these three prostate cell lines . It is thus possible that the down - regulating effect of AHCC ® on cortactin in prostate cancer cells is dependent on the malignant potential of the cells . In conclusion , AHCC ® treatment of prostate cancer cell lines , LNCaP . FGC and DU - 145 cells , down - regulated the protein levels of cortactin , but was not effective on PC - 3 cells . Further studies to clarify the difference between AHCC ® - resistant and AHCC ® - sensitive cells are necessary . Our findings suggest that inhibition of cortactin levels by AHCC ® treatment could be a promising strategy to control metastasis of prostate cancer .
