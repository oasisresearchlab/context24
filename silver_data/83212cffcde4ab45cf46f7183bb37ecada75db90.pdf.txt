In ﬁbroblasts PAK1 localizes to areas of membrane rufﬂing , as well as to amiloride - sensitive pinocytic vesicles . Expression of a PAK1 kinase autoinhibitory domain blocked both platelet - derived growth factor - and RacQ61L - stimulated uptake of 70 - kDa dextran particles , whereas an inactive version of this domain did not , indicating that PAK kinase activity is required for normal growth factor - induced macropinocytosis . The mechanisms by which PAK modulate macropinocytosis were examined in NIH3T3 cell lines expressing various PAK1 constructs under the control of a tetracycline - responsive transactivator . Cells expressing PAK1 ( H83 , 86L ) , a mutant that dramatically stimulates formation of dorsal membrane rufﬂes , exhibited increased macropi - nocytic uptake of 70 - kDa dextran particles in the absence of additional stimulation . This effect was not antagonized by coexpression of dominant - negative Rac1 - T17N . In the presence of platelet - derived growth factor , both PAK1 ( H83 , 86L ) and a highly kinase active PAK1 ( T423E ) mutant dramatically enhanced the uptake of 70 - kDa dextran . Neither wild - type PAK1 nor vector controls exhibited enhanced macropinocytosis , nor did PAK1 ( H83 , 86L ) affect clathrin - dependent endo - cytic mechanisms . Active versions of PAK1 enhanced both growth factor - stimulated 70 - kDa dextran uptake and efﬂux , suggesting that PAK1 activity modulated pinocytic vesicle cycling . These data indicate that PAK1 plays an important regulatory role in the process of macropino - cytosis , perhaps related to the requirement for PAK in directed cell motility . Introduction p21 - activated kinases ( PAKs 1 , 2 , 3 ) are a group of 62 – 68 - kDa serine / threonine kinases originally identiﬁed as targets of the small guanosine 5 9 - triphosphatases ( GTPases ) Rac and Cdc42 ( Manser et al . , 1994 ; Sells and Chernoff , 1997 ; Knaus and Bokoch , 1998 ) . GTP - bound forms of Rac and Cdc42 stimulate the activity of PAKs by binding to a speciﬁc N - terminal p21 - binding site ( Manser et al . , 1994 ; Burbelo et al . , 1995 ; Sells and Chernoff , 1997 ) , thereby relieving the inﬂuence of an adjacent kinase autoinhibitory domain ( Zhao et al . , 1998 ; Zenke et al . , 1999 ) . PAKs have been implicated as effectors in several Rac - and Cdc42 - regulated signaling pathways , including regulation of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase ( Knaus et al . , 1995 ) , p38 and C - jun N - terminal kinase activation ( Zhang et al . , 1995 ; Bagrodia et al . , 1995 ; Tang et al . , 1997 ) , and modulation of the actin cytoskeleton ( Dharmawardhane et al . , 1997 ; Manser et al . , 1997 ; Sells et al . , 1997 ; Daniels et al . , 1998 ) . Introduction of a constitutively active PAK1 ( H83 , 86L ) N - terminal mutant into a variety of adherent cells induces the formation of cortical actin structures similar to those known to be regulated by Rac and Cdc42 , including mem - brane rufﬂes and lamellipodia , ﬁlopodia , and focal com - plexes ( Dharmawardhane et al . , 1997 ; Manser et al . , 1997 ; Sells et al . , 1997 ) . PAK1 ( H83 , 86L ) is also effective at inducing the extension of circular dorsal rufﬂes and colocalizes with polymerized actin in these structures ( Dharmawardhane et al . , 1997 ; Edwards et al . , 1999 ) . Such actin - rich circular rufﬂes have been previously implicated in the process of macropi - ¶ Corresponding author : E - mail address : bokoch @ scripps . edu . ‡ Present address : Institut fu¨r Pharmakologie und Toxikologie , Medizinische Fakulta¨t , Rheinisch - Westfa¨lische Technische Hochschule Aachen , D52057 Germany . © 2000 by The American Society for Cell Biology 3341 nocytosis , ultimately contracting to f 1 orm macropinosomes of . 0 . 2 m m ( Bar - Sagi and Feramisco , 1986 ; Dowrick et al . , 1993 ; Swanson and Watts , 1995 ) . Macropinocytosis is an efﬁcient route for the nonselective uptake of solute macro - molecules , and may be either constitutive or stimulated by growth factors such as epidermal growth factor and platelet - derived growth factor ( PDGF ) ( Brunk et al . , 1976 ; Hewlett et al . , 1994 ) , macrophage colony - stimulating factor ( Racoosin and Swanson , 1989 , 1992 ) , interleukin - 4 ( Sallusto et al . , 1995 ) , and by phorbol esters ( Swanson , 1989b ) . Interestingly , these agents are known to initiate signaling pathways leading to activation of the Rac GTPase , which has been implicated in regulating macropinocytosis ( Ridley et al . , 1992 ) . The prev - alence of macropinocytosis in many cell types suggests that it may contribute to cellular processes in addition to nutrient uptake , although these roles have remained elusive , except in the case of host – pathogen interactions ( Francis et al . , 1993 ; Swanson and Watts , 1995 ; Chen et al . , 1996 ) . It is possible that the internalization of plasma membrane resulting from the rapid and transient stimulation of macropinocytosis by growth factors may be involved in directed cell movement . For example , regulation of membrane ﬂux via pinocytosis may contribute to the membrane ﬂow that is thought to be a driving force for cell locomotion ( Bretscher , 1996 , 1998 ) . We previously showed that endogenous PAK1 in Swiss 3T3 ﬁbroblasts localized to pinocytic vesicles by colocalizing an afﬁnity - puriﬁed PAK1 antibody with a marker for bulk ﬂuid - phase uptake ( Dharmawardhane et al . , 1997 ) . Coupled with the observation that PAK1 can induce the formation of circular dorsal rufﬂes similar to those associated with the macropino - cytic uptake process , a potential role for PAK in regulating this activity is suggested . We show here that inhibition of endoge - nous PAK activity using a PAK - speciﬁc autoinhibitory domain blocks growth factor - induced macropinocytosis , indicating that PAK activity is required for normal macropinocytosis . In addition , PDGF - stimulated macropinocytosis is enhanced by activated PAK1 mutants , with both uptake and efﬂux rates affected . These data indicate a direct regulatory role for PAK in macropinocytosis that involves both PAK kinase activity and cytoskeletal remodeling . Table 1 . Inhibition of fDx uptake induced by PDGF - and PAK1 ( H83 , 86L ) by the PAK1 AID Serum - starved NIH3T3 cells in which PAK1 ( H83 , 86L ) expression was induced by tetracycline withdrawal or repressed by tetracycline maintenance ( Control ) were infected with Semliki Forest virus containing myc - tagged PAK1 autoinhibitory domain ( aa 83 – 149 ) or inactivated PAK1 AID ( aa 83 – 149 , L107F ) , as in Edwards et al . ( 1999 ) . Cells were then either treated without ( 2 ) or with ( 1 ) 6 ng / ml PDGF , followed by the addition of 0 . 5 mg / ml lysine - ﬁxable 70 - kDa fDx , for 30 min as in MATERIALS AND METHODS . Virally transfected cells were detected by staining with an anti - myc 9E10 antibody followed by a FITC - tagged secondary antibody . Cells were quantitated in a ﬂuorescence microscope using a 40X objective , and scored as 2 , 1 , or 11 according to the relative level of fDx uptake , as in the representative ﬂuorescent micrographs shown . A total of 100 – 216 cells ( only myc - staining cells were counted for each condition after viral transfections ) were counted per experimental condition in 10 separate ﬁelds per coverslip . The values shown are given as a percentage of cells in each scoring category and were calculated as the mean 6 SE by using data from three separate experiments performed in duplicate . S . Dharmawardhane et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 3342 MATERIALS AND METHODS Transfection and Cell Culture Culturing and handling of Swiss 3T3 cells was as described ( Dhar - mawardhane et al . , 1997 ) . The NIH3T3 variant S2 - 6 bearing a tetra - cycline - regulated transactivator ( Shockett et al . , 1995 ) was used to construct cell lines that inducibly express PAK1 and various mu - tants ; the establishment and characterization of these clones has been described ( Sells et al . , 1999 ) . The NIH3T3 cell lines were cul - tured in DMEM with 10 % calf serum , 2 . 5 mM histidinol , 2 m g / ml puromycin , and 0 . 5 m g / ml tetracycline ( Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) . Three to ﬁve days after seeding , the cells were incubated for 24 h in the culture medium with or without tetracycline , and for 16 h in serum - free medium to obtain quiescent cells expressing PAK1 pro - tein constructs . In some experiments , proteins were expressed by using a Semliki Forest virus protein expression system , as described in Sanders et al . ( 1999 ) . Transfection efﬁciency was routinely . 90 % by using the virus system . Quantiﬁcation of Macropinocytosis Labeling of pinocytic vesicles and measuring uptake of ﬂuorescent dextran was performed as described previously ( Swanson 1989a ; Racoosin and Swanson , 1994 ) . Cells serum starved for 18 h were additionally preincubated on ice for 30 min in 24 - well plates to reduce basal levels of macropinocytosis , and then activated by addition of 5 ng / ml PDGF - BB ( Upstate Biotechnology , Lake Placid , NY ) as indi - cated , and immediately before addition of the 70 - kDa dextran ﬂuores - cent probe . Cells were incubated at 37°C in 0 . 5 mg / ml 70 - kDa ﬂuores - cein - tagged dextran ( fDx ) ( Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR ) for various times . In some experiments , 100 nM wortmannin or 10 m g / ml cytocha - lasin D was added for 15 min before addition of PDGF and ﬂuorescent dextran . To terminate dextran uptake , cell plates were transferred to ice and washed three times for 5 min each in 1 liter of ice - cold phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) . Cells were lysed by incubation for 30 min at 37°C in 0 . 5 % Triton - X 100 in PBS . Cell lysates were excited at 494 nm and the emission at 520 nm was determined in a luminescence spectrometer LS50B ( Perkin - Elmer / Cetus , Norwalk , CT ) to quantitate the internal - ized 70 - kDa fDx . Conditions for variations on the uptake experiments , and for fDx efﬂux experiments are described in the relevant ﬁgure legends . Fluorescence Microscopy Immunoﬂuorescence microscopy was performed as described in Racoosin and Swanson ( 1994 ) . NIH3T3 cells expressing vector alone or PAK1 mutant proteins were incubated with 0 . 5 mg / ml lysine - ﬁxable 70 - kDa Texas Red dextran and / or 5 ng / ml PDGF for 30 min , as indicated . After fDx uptake , the cells were ﬁxed for 1 h in a modiﬁed periodate – lysine – paraformaldehyde ﬁxative . In the exper - iments with the Semliki Forest virus gene expression system , the cells were permeabilized in ice - cold MeOH for 1 . 5 min , and the transfected cells were detected by staining for 1 h in 1 : 200 anti - myc ( 9E10 ) antibody . The secondary antibody incubation was for 1 h in 1 : 500 ﬂuorescein - conjugated anti - rabbit mouse IgG ( Cappel Labo - ratories , Cochranville , PA ) . Washed coverslips were mounted in Anti - Fade ( Molecular Probes ) . Measurement of Transferrin Uptake ( Clathrin - mediated Endocytosis ) Transferrin uptake as a measure of clathrin - mediated endocytosis was assayed according to Damke et al . ( 1994 ) . Brieﬂy , quiescent cells expressing PAK1 ( H83 , 86L ) mutation or vector control cells , with or with out the addition of 5 ng / ml PDGF , were incubated with 4 mg / ml transferrin in PBS with 1 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM glucose , and 0 . 2 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) for various times at 37°C . Cells were recovered by the addition of 5 mM EDTA in PBS , and each treatment was divided into two aliquots . One aliquot was used to determine the total transferrin bound and the other aliquot was treated with avidin and biocytin to block surface - bound trans - ferrin . Cells were lysed in 1 % Triton - X 100 lysis buffer containing 0 . 5 % BSA and plated in wells coated with anti - transferrin antibody . After an overnight incubation in primary antibody , the washed wells were incubated in 1 : 5000 streptavidin : horseradish peroxidase and the color was developed by the addition of 0 . 4 mg / ml l - phenylendiamine and 0 . 44 m l / ml hydrogen peroxide . The color reaction was read at 490 - nm absorption in an EIA Autoreader , model LL310 , Biotek Instruments , Luton , United Kingdom . The total transferrin bound for each treatment condition was used to calculate the percentage of transferrin internalized for each sample , as in Damke et al . ( 1994 ) . RESULTS PAK Activity Is Required for PDGF - stimulated Macropinocytosis We previously demonstrated that a portion of endogenous PAK1 in Swiss 3T3 cells localized to vesicles characterized by their ability to internalize rhodamine - labeled BSA from Figure 1 . Inhibition of Rac Q61L - induced fDx uptake by PAK1 AID . Serum - starved NIH3T3 cells stably transfected with a tetracy - cline - inducible vector only were infected with Semliki Forest virus containing myc - tagged PAK1 ( 83 – 149 ) , PAK1 ( 83 – 149 , L107F ) . Rac1 ( Q61L ) , or combinations thereof as indicated ( methods as in Ed - wards et al . , 1999 ; Sanders et al . , 1999 ) . After 10 h of infection , the cells were incubated in 5 mg / ml lysine - ﬁxable 70 - kDa fDx for 30 min , and then ﬁxed , permeabilized , and stained for the myc epitope by using anti - myc 9E10 antibody , followed by a ﬂuorescein isothio - cyanate - tagged secondary antibody . Cells were scored by using a ﬂuorescence microscope with 40 3 objective as 2 , 1 , or 11 accord - ing to the level of fDx uptake , as illustrated in Table 1 . A total of ; 200 cells was counted per experimental condition by using 10 separate ﬁelds per coverslip . Values , given as a percentage of cells in each scoring category , from three separate experiments are shown as the mean 6 SE . PAK Is Required for Macropinocytosis Vol . 11 , October 2000 3343 solution ( Dharmawardhane et al . , 1997 ) . In cells pretreated with 3 mM amiloride , a potent inhibitor of Na 1 / H 1 ex - change that effectively abolishes uptake of 70 - kDa fDx under our assay conditions ( West et al . , 1989 ; Dowrick et al . , 1993 ; Swanson and Watts , 1995 ) , PAK1 redistributed from the vesicular structures to a diffuse localization throughout the cytoplasm , consistent with the conclusion that PAK1 colo - calizes with pinocytic vesicles . To determine whether the association of PAK1 with pino - cytic vesicles was indicative of a regulatory role of PAK1 in macropinocytosis , we assessed the uptake of fDx in NIH3T3 cells expressing the PAK1 autoinhibitory domain , aa 83 – 149 ( AID ) . This domain interacts in trans with the PAK catalytic domain to speciﬁcally block the ability of PAK to phosphor - ylate exogenous substrates ( Zhao et al . , 1998 ; Zenke et al . , 1999 ) . As shown in Table 1 , expression of the AID did not affect the low levels of fDx uptake in quiescent cells . How - ever , in the presence of PDGF , AID expression almost com - pletely suppressed fDx uptake . In contrast , when we inacti - vated the AID by mutating it at L107F ( Zenke et al . , 1999 ) , fDx uptake was restored to the levels seen in control cells . These data indicate that PAK1 kinase activity is required for the normal process of growth factor - stimulated macropino - cytosis . Figure 2 . PDGF - stimulated pinocytosis in cell lines expressing PAK1 or PAK1 mutants . ( A ) NIH3T3 cells transformed with wild - type PAK1 , PAK1 ( T423E ) , PAK1 ( H83 , 86L ) , or PAK1 ( K299R ) were either main - tained in tetracycline ( 1 ) or grown for 24 h in media without tetracycline ( 2 ) to induce PAK protein ex - pression . Expression of PAK proteins was determined to be equal by immunoblot , as in Sells et al . ( 1999 ) . During the induction period , the cells were serum starved for 18 h , and then cooled on ice for 30 min before the start of the experiment to render them quiescent . The uptake of 70 - kDa fDx was measured for 60 min in the presence or absence of 5 ng / ml PDGF as described in MATERIALS AND METHODS . The ab - sorption / emission spectra for ﬂuorescein at 494 / 520 nm were determined , and data plotted as the percent - age of control ( i . e , . the amount of fDx70 taken up in the presence of 5 ng / ml PDGF / amount of fDx70 up - take in the absence of PDGF 3 100 ) for each treatment . The values shown are the mean 6 SD of the mean for n 5 4 determinations in two separate experiments . Tet , tetracycline . ( B ) Uptake of 70 - kDa fDx was per - formed as above , except that cells were not precooled before the addition of lysine ﬁxable 70 - kDa fDx and 5 ng / ml PDGF . The cells were ﬁxed in a periodate – lysine – paraformaldehyde ﬁxative as detailed in MA - TERIALS AND METHODS , and the ﬂuorescence of fDx was visualized in the various induced PAK1 NIH3T3 cell lines at t 5 30 min . Micrographs shown are at 5000 3 . S . Dharmawardhane et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 3344 A role for Rac in regulating growth factor - stimulated ﬂu - id - phase uptake was previously suggested by the observa - tion ( Ridley et al . , 1992 ) that dominant - negative Rac1 ( T17N ) reduced cellular uptake of dextrans . We conﬁrmed that ex - pression of a constitutively active Rac1 Q61L stimulated 70 - kDa fDx uptake by NIH3T3 cells ( Figure 1 ) . This stimu - latory effect of Rac Q61L could be almost completely blocked by the expression of the PAK1 AID , but not by the inacti - vated L107F version . Thus , Rac - mediated macropinocytosis is also dependent upon PAK catalytic activity . Active PAK1 Mutants Increase PDGF - stimulated Macropinocytosis Stable NIH3T3 cell lines expressing either vector alone , wild - type PAK1 , or a series of PAK1 functional mutants under control of a tetracycline - regulated transactivator were used to investigate the mechanism ( s ) through which PAK1 modulated macropinocytosis . PAK1 ( H83 , 86L ) is a cytoskeletally active form of PAK that no longer binds Rac or Cdc42 and which has moderate constitutive kinase activity , PAK1 ( K299R ) is mu - tated in the ATP - binding site and is inactive as a kinase , and PAK1 ( T423E ) has high constitutive kinase activity . The effects of these PAK1 mutants on the actin cytoskeleton have been described in detail ( Sells et al . , 1997 , 1999 ) . Elimination of tet - racycline from the growth medium for 24 h resulted in expres - sion of each hemagglutinin - tagged PAK1 construct to compa - rable levels as determined by immunoblot . When these cells were stimulated with PDGF in the presence of tetracycline , each cell line exhibited quantitatively enhanced macropinocy - tosis , typically ranging from 30 to 50 % higher in the presence of PDGF than in the absence of stimulation ( Figure 2A ) . Induced expression ( 2 tetracycline ) of wild - type PAK1 and PAK1 ( K299R ) proteins did not cause statistically signiﬁcant changes in PDGF - stimulated macropinocytosis compared with unin - duced cells . However , the clones expressing the activated PAK1 ( H83 , 86L ) and ( T423E ) mutations showed statistically signiﬁcant higher levels of PDGF - stimulated macropinocytosis , on the order of 150 – 200 % greater than were observed in the noninduced cells ( Figure 2A ) . Expression of the PAK AID ( aa 83 – 149 ) substantially suppressed the enhanced mactropino - cytic response induced by PAK ( H83 , 86L ) ( Table 1 ) . Thus , constitutive activation of PAK1 , either by mutating the GTPase binding / anti - inhibitory domain or by directly activating the kinase domain , results in a signiﬁcantly greater PDGF - stimu - lated macropinocytosis . We visualized the uptake of 70 - kDa fDx in the presence and absence of PDGF in the control and PAK1 mutant clones by ﬂuorescence microscopy ( Figure 2B ) . As shown in Figure 2A , PDGF addition stimulated fDx uptake in all cell lines . Of particular note , PAK1 ( H83 , 86L ) exhibited enhanced fDx uptake even in the absence of PDGF , notably in association with dorsal rufﬂes and large macropinocytic vesicles . The microscopic images emphasize the effectiveness of PAK1 ( H83 , 86L ) , but not PAK1 ( T423E ) , to stimulate macropino - cytosis even in the absence of PDGF , although addition of PDGF results in a synergistic enhancement of uptake . Mac - ropinocytosis induced by PAK1 ( H83 , 86L ) alone was sensi - tive to expression of the active PAK1 AID ( Table 1 ) . Figure 3 . Effects of PAK on fDx uptake and efﬂux kinetics . ( A ) Effects of preincubation of cells with PDGF on the regulation of fDx uptake by PAK were examined . NIH3T3 cells expressing either vector alone ( control ) , PAK1 wild type , or the indicated point mu - tants were maintained for 24 h in the absence of tetracycline to allow PAK1 protein expression . Cells were serum starved for 18 h during the expression period , and then PDGF ( 5 ng / ml ) added to each cell line for 45 min . At the end of each incubation period , 5 mg / ml 70 - kDa fDx was added and uptake measured at 0 , 2 . 5 , 5 , 10 , and 15 min . Cells were washed free of noninternalized fDx and the amount of fDx in cell lysates quantiﬁed by spectroﬂuorometry . The amount of fDx taken up per minute in the linear phase was plotted ( 6 SE ; n 5 6 ) . ( B ) NIH3T3 cell lines were handled as described above . After serum starvation for 18 h , PDGF and 70 - kDa fDx were added to the cells for 45 min to allow uptake , and then washed three times in ice cold PBS and incubated in PBS containing 5 . 5 mM glucose , 1 mM CaCl 2 , and 10 mM MgCl 2 for the indicated times . Cells were lysed and the fDx retained was quantitated by spectroﬂuorometry . One hundred percent represents the amount of fDx contained within each cell line at t 5 0 min . SD for each data point was , 18 % of the mean ( n 5 6 ) . PAK Is Required for Macropinocytosis Vol . 11 , October 2000 3345 PAK Modulates Both Uptake and Recycling Kinetics of Macropinocytic Vesicles The accumulation of 70 - kDa fDx we measured at steady state reﬂects both uptake and regurgitation kinetics ( Cupers et al . , 1994 ) . We attempted to assess the effects of PAK on the actual uptake process by measuring linear fDx uptake during a 15 - min time course after stimulation for 45 min with PDGF ( Fig - ure 3A ) . Under these conditions , we observed that PAK1 ( T423E ) and PAK1 ( H83 , 86L ) , but not PAK1 wild type or PAK1 ( K299R ) , consistently increased uptake of 70 - kDa fDx by 200 to 500 % , respectively . We also performed the experiment of mea - suring fDx uptake over short 10 - min intervals after preincuba - tion for 0 , 10 , 20 , 30 , 45 , or 60 min with PDGF . An increased level of fDx uptake was also detected for PAK1 ( T423E ) and ( H83 , 86L ) by using this protocol ( data not shown ) . Receptor - stimulated macropinocytosis has previously been shown to involve effects on both the uptake and efﬂux phases of macropinocytic vesicle cycling ( Racoosin and Swanson , 1989 ; Swanson , 1989b ) . We therefore examined the effects of PAK on efﬂux kinetics of fDx from preloaded cells ( Figure 3B ) . Wild - type PAK exhibited efﬂux rates similar to those seen in control cells . PAK1 ( K299R ) expression modestly decreased fDx efﬂux at longer times , perhaps due to the ability of this construct to interact with Rac to form a nonproductive com - plex . The inhibition of 70 - kDa fDx efﬂux is likely to mask at steady state any evident decrease in fDx uptake that would occur as a result of dominant - negative activity of this kinase - dead version of PAK . In contrast , both PAK1 ( H83 , 86L ) and PAK1 ( T423E ) dramatically increased the efﬂux rates of fDx . Because the effect of these mutants on steady - state uptake of fDx was positive even in the presence of the enhanced efﬂux they induce , this indicates that these activated forms of PAK1 had even greater effects on the uptake phase than is apparent in the steady - state cumulative data . PAK1 thus appears to posi - tively regulate the cycling of pinocytic vesicles . Effects of PAK1 ( H83 , 86L ) on Macropinocytosis Correlate with Effects on Dorsal Rufﬂe Formation To assess whether the increased macropinocytosis observed in the presence of PAK1 ( H83 , 86L ) was associated with the increased dorsal rufﬂing that had been previously observed in cells into which PAK1 ( H83 , 86L ) was introduced ( Dhar - mawardhane et al . , 1997 ; Edwards et al . , 1999 ) , the distribu - tion of PAK1 and F - actin was monitored in serum - starved ( but not precooled ) cells after incubation in PDGF and non - ﬂuorescent 70 - kDa dextran ( Figure 4 ) . Before PDGF addi - tion , PAK1 was localized to small vesicles in the cytosol and the perinuclear region of both control and PAK ( H83 , 86L ) cell lines , presumably representing a basal level of constitu - tive pinocytic vesicle formation . The induced PAK ( H83 , 86L ) cell line exhibited constitutive membrane and dorsal rufﬂing in a portion of the cell population even in the absence of PDGF . Immediately after PDGF addition , the PAK1 Figure 4 . PAK1 and F - actin localization in PAK1 ( H83 , 86L ) - expressing cells . Localization of PAK1 , determined with a speciﬁc afﬁnity puriﬁed anti - PAK1 antibody , or of F - actin , determined by rhodamine phalloidin staining , was examined in either vector control ( left two columns ) or PAK1 ( H83 , 86L ) ( right two columns ) - expressing cell lines at various times after PDGF ( 5 ng / ml ) stimulation , as described in MATERIALS AND METHODS . The arrowheads indicate areas where PAK1 and F - actin colocalize in sites of membrane rufﬂing . The short arrows point to remnants of macropinocytic vesicles whose outline is visible in the stained cells . Micrographs shown are at 3000 3 . S . Dharmawardhane et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 3346 ( H83 , 86L ) - expressing cells started forming large numbers of dorsal rufﬂes , which were evident beginning at 5 min after PDGF . In contrast , the other cell lines exhibited varying lesser degrees of dorsal rufﬂe formation , as well as small membrane rufﬂes at 10 min after PDGF . At 20 - min post - PDGF , large macropinocytic vesicles lined with PAK1 were observed in the cytosol . The PAK1 ( H83 , 86L ) cells exhibited a higher number of the phase dense macropinocytic vesicles , and these were often closely associated with dorsal rufﬂes ( Figure 2B , bottom ) . Interestingly , even though PAK1 and F - actin were found to be colocalized in the dorsal rufﬂes ( Figure 4 and Dharmawardhane et al . , 1997 ) , only PAK1 localizes to the subsequent pinocytic vesicles formed . This suggests that once the surface rufﬂes take up ﬂuids and constrict to close off the vesicle , F - actin is only transiently associated with the resulting mature macropinosome . Increased PDGF - stimulated Pinocytosis Induced by Expression of Activated PAK1 Is Sensitive to Wortmannin and Cytochalasin D , but Is Not Inhibited by Dominant - Negative Rac Because ﬂuid - phase pinocytosis , and not receptor - mediated endocytosis , has been reported to be inhibited by the phos - phatidylinositol ( PI ) 3 - kinase inhibitor wortmannin ( Barker et al . , 1995 ; Clague et al . , 1995 ; Araki et al . , 1996 ) , we exam - ined the effect of wortmannin on macropinocytosis stimu - lated by PDGF in the transformed NIH3T3 cell lines . Wort - mannin inhibited the PDGF - stimulated 70 - kDa fDx uptake in all cell lines to control levels , including the enhanced pinocytosis observed in the lines expressing PAK1 ( T423E ) and PAK1 ( H83 , 86L ) ( Figure 5 ) . This result indicates that PI 3 - kinase is involved in the regulation of the same macropi - nocytotic process enhanced by PAK1 , and that the pharma - cology of the process differs from clathrin - mediated endo - cytosis . We also examined the effect of the actin ﬁlament - disrupting agent cytochalasin D on the regulation of macropinocytosis by PAK1 . Macropinocytosis induced by PDGF was inhibited substantially by cytochalasin D in con - trol and PAK1 mutant cell lines ( Figure 5 ) . The effects of wortmannin and cytochalasin D correlated with inhibition of the formation of actin - rich dorsal rufﬂes required for the bulk uptake of ﬂuids . To rule out the possibility that the dramatic stimulatory effects of PAK1 ( H83 , 86L ) on macropinocytosis that we ob - served were an indirect result of Rac activation , we mea - sured 70 - kDa fDx uptake in the presence of wild - type or dominant - negative Rac1 ( T17N ) ( Figure 6 ) . Approximately 70 – 80 % of the PAK1 ( H83 , 86L ) and PAK1 ( H83 , 86L ) , Rac1 ( T17N ) double mutants demonstrated enhanced fDx uptake . Coexpression of Rac1 wild type with PAK1 ( H83 , 86L ) did not signiﬁcantly modify the effect of PAK on macropinocy - tosis . These results indicate that PAK regulates macropino - cytosis independently of , or downstream from , Rac1 . PAK1 Does Not Regulate Clathrin - mediated Endocytosis To conﬁrm that the enhanced effect of the PAK1 ( H83 , 86L ) mutant on PDGF - stimulated 70 - kDa fDx uptake was due to macropinocytosis , we quantiﬁed the uptake of transferrin in control and PAK1 ( H83 , 86L ) cell lines . Transferrin is known to be internalized via clathrin - coated endocytic vesicles ( Hopkins , 1983 ; Sandvig and van Deurs , 1990 ) . As seen in Figure 7 , PAK1 ( H83 , 86L ) cells did not differ from control cells in the uptake of transferrin . Both cell lines exhibited peak transferrin uptake at 10 min , and the uptake was unaffected by stimulation with PDGF . In conjunction with the inhibitory effect of wortmannin , we conclude that the enhanced uptake of 70 - kDa fDx induced by active PAK1 in the presence of PDGF is due to macropinocytosis , and does not involve receptor - and clathrin - mediated endocytic mechanisms . Figure 5 . Inhibition of PAK1 - enhanced macropinocytosis by the PI 3 - kinase inhibitor wortmannin and by the F - actin disrupting agent cytochalasin D . Uptake of 70 - kDa fDx was measured in cells ex - pressing control vector , PAK1 wild - type , and PAK1 point muta - tions . As indicated , the cells were pretreated with either 100 nM wortmannin ( A ) or 10 m g / ml cytochalasin D ( B ) for 10 min , and then stimulated with 5 ng / ml PDGF and fDx added at t 5 0 . Uptake was for 45 min . Percentage of control is the amount of fDx70 taken up under each condition compared with the nondrug - or PDGF - treated cells ( set to 100 % ) . Results shown are the mean 6 SD of 2 – 3 experiments performed in duplicate . PAK Is Required for Macropinocytosis Vol . 11 , October 2000 3347 DISCUSSION It has previously been established that PAK1 regulates cy - toskeletal dynamics , including formation of membrane ruf - ﬂes , lamellipodia , and organization of focal complexes ( Dharmawardhane et al . , 1997 ; Sells et al . , 1997 ; Daniels et al . , 1998 ; Edwards et al . , 1999 ) . One of the most intriguing ob - servations from our earlier localization studies was the fact that a fraction of endogenous PAK1 colocalized with a marker for ﬂuid - phase uptake ( Dharmawardhane et al . , Figure 6 . Macropinocytosis in cells expressing PAK1 and Rac1 mu - tants . NIH3T3 cell lines expressing PAK1 ( H83 , 86L ) were incubated in media with or without ( control ) tetracycline for protein induction . These cells were then infected with a Semliki Forest virus expression construct containing either myc - tagged dominant - negative Rac1 ( T17N ) or Rac1 wild type ( WT ) ( Sanders et al . , 1999 ) . ( A ) After 12 h of infection , the cells were incubated in 5 ng / ml PDGF and 5 mg / ml ﬁxable 70 - kDa fDX for 45 min , and then ﬁxed , permeabilized , and stained by using the 9E10 - myc epitope antibody ( Racoosin and Swanson , 1994 ) . Row A , ﬂuorescence micrographs of representative cells demonstrating fDx retained in macropinocytic vesicles . Row B , same cells stained with anti - myc 9E10 to detect Rac1 - WT and - T17N expression . Row C , same cells under phase contrast microscopy . ( B ) After 12 h of infection , the cells were incubated in 5 ng / ml PDGF and 5 mg / ml lysine - ﬁxable 70 - kDa fDx for 45 min , and then ﬁxed , per - meabilized , and stained for the myc epitope by using anti - myc 9E10 antibody , followed by a ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate - tagged secondary antibody . Cells were scored by using a ﬂuorescence microscope with 40 3 objective as 2 , 1 , or 11 according to the level of fDx uptake , as illustrated in Table 1 . A total of ; 200 cells was counted per experi - mental condition by using 10 separate ﬁelds per coverslip . Values , given as a percentage of cells in each scoring category , from three separate experiments are shown as the mean 6 SE . S . Dharmawardhane et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 3348 1997 ) . Additionally , at early times after stimulation of qui - escent cells with PDGF , PAK1 was predominantly associ - ated with F - actin in circular rufﬂes on the cell surface ( dorsal rufﬂes ) . Indeed , PAK1 initially localized to ring - like struc - tures that preceded the F - actin – associated dorsal rufﬂes , suggesting that PAK1 may be regulating the early organi - zation of such rufﬂes . Finally , microinjection of an activated PAK1 ( H83 , 86L ) resulted in a marked increase in the forma - tion of dorsal rufﬂes . Because dorsal or circular rufﬂes are known to be precursors of macropinocytic vesicles ( Swan - son and Watts , 1995 ) , the possible regulation of macropino - cytosis by PAK was investigated in the present study . To preferentially focus on the process of macropinocy - tosis , we used a large 70 - kDa dextran molecule in uptake studies ( Araki et al . , 1996 ) . Using the PAK1 AID as a speciﬁc means to inhibit endogenous PAK kinase activity , we showed that PDGF - stimulated uptake of fDx was blocked by . 85 % ( Table 1 ) . This was a speciﬁc inhibitory effect on endogenous PAK because introduction of an L107F mutation into the AID , which prevents it from binding to and inhibiting the PAK catalytic domain ( Ze - nke et al . , 1999 ) , prevented any signiﬁcant effect on mac - ropinocytosis . The stimulatory effects of growth factors on macropinocytosis may be mediated through activation of Rac1 , and we observed that the ability of constitutively active Rac1 Q61L to stimulate fDx uptake was also spe - ciﬁcally attenuated by inhibition of PAK kinase activity ( Figure 1 ) . Role of PAK 1 in Dorsal Rufﬂing Leading to Macropinocytosis Quantiﬁcation of macropinocytosis , as well as ﬂuorescent mi - croscopic observation of cells after addition of 70 - kDa fDx , indicates that activated forms of PAK1 increase macropinocy - tosis , especially after PDGF addition to quiescent cells . In the absence of PDGF , only PAK1 ( H83 , 86L ) signiﬁcantly stimu - lated dextran uptake ( Figure 2B ) . This stimulatory effect ap - pears to correlate with the ability of PAK1 ( H83 , 86L ) to induce dorsal rufﬂe formation ( Figures 2B and 4 ) . PAK1 ( T423E ) , al - though highly active as a kinase , does not effectively induce the formation of dorsal rufﬂes ( Sells et al . , 1997 ; Edwards et al . , 1999 ) , presumably due to the inability to make necessary N - terminal protein – protein interactions . Accordingly , expression of the PAK1 ( T423E ) mutant did not stimulate dextran uptake in the absence of PDGF ( Figure 2B ) . PDGF stimulated steady - state uptake of 70 - kDa fDx by 30 to 50 % in control cells , and this level of stimulation did not change in any of the stable cell lines in the absence of PAK1 protein induction ( Figure 2A ) . In cells in which expression of a vector control , wild - type PAK1 , or a ki - nase - inactive PAK1 ( K299R ) had been induced , there was still no signiﬁcant effect on macropinocytosis of the 70 - kDa fDx . In contrast , both the PAK1 ( T423E ) and PAK1 ( H83 , 86L ) proteins markedly enhance PDGF - induced macropinocytosis . Time course studies indicated that the PAK1 ( H83 , 86L ) was more effective than PAK1 ( T423E ) in enhancing dextran uptake at early times . This is likely to Figure 7 . PAK1 has no effect on transferrin uptake via clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Uptake of transferrin was determined as de - scribed in MATERIALS AND METHODS in the induced vector control ( circles ) or PAK1 ( H83 , 86L ) - expressing ( triangles ) stable cell lines . The percentage of transferrin uptake is the amount of transferrin internalized as a function of the total amount of transferrin bound for each treatment . The results shown are of one experiment representative of two similar experiments , both of which showed no differences in transferrin uptake stimu - lated by PDGF ( closed symbols ) in either the absence or presence of PAK1 ( H83 , 86L ) ex - pression . No signiﬁcant differences in total transferrin binding were observed between the two cell lines . PAK Is Required for Macropinocytosis Vol . 11 , October 2000 3349 relate to the ability of this PAK1 mutant to stimulate dorsal rufﬂe formation in this time period . Treatment of a variety of cell types with growth factors is often followed by an intensive burst of rufﬂing of the apical surface membranes , which appears to be the earliest structural change observed during macropinocytosis ( Swanson and Watts , 1995 ) . PDGF b - receptors are especially known to induce such circular rufﬂes and macropinocytosis ( West - mark et al . , 1990 ; Erickson et al . , 1992 ) . At later times , we observed that the PAK1 ( T423E ) also enhanced fDx up - take . The effectiveness of this highly kinase - active PAK1 mutant , in conjunction with the observed inhibition by the PAK AID , suggests that the kinase activity of PAK must play some role in regulating the uptake process . It is tempting to speculate that this effect may be due to the ability of PAK to modulate contractile activity of myosin ( Tuazon and Traugh , 1984 ; Brzeska et al . , 1997 ; Ramos et al . , 1997 ; Sanders et al . , 1999 ) because myosin II localizes to dorsal rufﬂes during macropinocytosis ( Dowrick et al . , 1993 ) and myosin function has been shown to be required for the contractile activity , which closes macropinosomes ( Swanson et al . , 1999 ) . Alternatively , the ability of PAK to modulate actin dynamics via regulation of LIM kinase and coﬁlin ( Edwards et al . , 1999 ) may also be important . PAK1 Is a Speciﬁc Regulator of Macropinocytosis Our data indicate that PAK1 speciﬁcally regulates macropi - nocytosis as opposed to clathrin - or receptor - mediated en - docytosis , although the exact biochemical mechanism ( s ) ac - counting for the ﬂuid - phase uptake we are measuring is unknown . The PAK1 ( H83 , 86L ) mutant , which was most effective at enhancing PDGF - stimulated pinocytosis , did not have an effect on receptor - regulated transferrin uptake in the presence ( or absence ) of PDGF ( Figure 7 ) . Additionally , amiloride blocked the uptake of 70 - kDa fDx and abolished PAK1 immunolocalization to cytosolic vesicles . Amiloride is an inhibitor of Na 1 / H 1 exchange that has been found to considerably reduce pinocytosis stimulated by growth factor receptors ( West et al . , 1989 ; Dowrick et al . , 1993 ; Swanson and Watts , 1995 ) . Inhibition of PI 3 - kinase activity by wortmannin and LY294002 is known to attenuate macropinocytosis ( Barker et al . , 1995 ; Clague et al . , 1995 ; Swanson and Watts , 1995 ) . Araki et al . ( 1996 ) showed that PI 3 - kinase activity is necessary for the completion of actin - dependent macropi - nocytosis but not for the initial rufﬂing phase in macro - phages . We observed that addition of wortmannin de - creased fDx uptake in all the cell lines tested , including the enhanced PDGF - stimulated uptake observed with PAK1 ( H83 , 86L ) ( Figure 5 ) . Because clathrin - mediated en - docytosis is resistant to PI 3 - kinase inhibitors , these data also indicate that the observed internalization of 70 - kDa fDx is likely to be due to macropinocytosis . The actin ﬁlament - disrupting agent cytochalasin D has been shown to reduce internalization of ricin and ﬂuid - phase markers without reducing the uptake of transferrin ( Sandvig and van Deurs , 1990 ) . We observed that cytocha - lasin D inhibited PDGF - stimulated macropinocytosis in all the cell lines tested ( Figure 5 ) . Cytochalasin D also reduced the enhanced fDx uptake induced by PAK1 ( H83 , 86L ) in the absence of PDGF . The inhibitory effect of cytochalasin D is likely to be due to inhibition of the PDGF - mediated actin polymerization required to induce membrane rufﬂing as a prerequisite for formation of the pinosome . Conclusion The data presented here show that PAK1 is capable of regu - lating macropinocytic uptake of solutes . Expression of a cy - toskeletally active PAK1 ( H83 , 86L ) was capable by itself of stimulating uptake of 70 - kDa dextran . In the presence of PDGF , both PAK1 ( H83 , 86L ) and a highly kinase active form of PAK1 ( T423E ) caused synergistic increases in PDGF - stimu - lated macropinocytosis . The role of PAK in inducing cytoskel - etal changes , particularly the formation of circular rufﬂes on the dorsal surface of cells , in combination with regulatory effects on contractile activities of myosin ( Ramos et al . , 1997 ; Chew et al . , 1998 ; Sanders et al . , 1999 ) or on actin polymeriza - tion via LIM kinase ( Edwards et al . , 1999 ) , provide a possible mechanistic basis for the enhancement of pinocytosis we report here . Such regulation may be important for processes ranging from nutrient uptake during cell growth to the invasion of cells by certain pathogenic bacteria . Several recent studies have shown that PAK is required for normal cell motility and directed migration ( Kiosses et al . , 1999 ; Sells et al . , 1999 ) . Although the relationship among macropinocytosis , membrane rufﬂing , and cell motility re - mains unclear , it is intriguing to speculate that PAK1 - regu - lated cycling of plasma membrane via macropinocytosis may contribute toward directed cell movement as predicted in the model described by Bretscher ( 1996 , 1998 ) . Indeed , the dramatic effects of PAK on both the uptake and efﬂux of 70 - kDa fDx could reﬂect a redistribution of macropinocytic vesicles and the accompanying membrane from the rear of polarized cells to the leading edge . We plan to investigate this possibility in future studies . ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank Luraynne C . Sanders , Ph .
