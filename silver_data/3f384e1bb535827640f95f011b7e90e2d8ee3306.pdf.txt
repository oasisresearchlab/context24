While animal models have long served to study the basic functions of the skin in vivo , new insights are expected from in vitro models of human skin development . Human pluripotent stem cells ( PSCs ) have proven to be invaluable tools for studying human development in vitro . To understand the mechanisms regulating human skin homeostasis and injury repair at the molecular level , recent efforts aim to differentiate PSCs towards skin epidermal keratinocytes , dermal ﬁ broblasts , and skin appendages such as hair follicles and sebaceous glands . Here , we present an overview of the literature describing strategies for human PSC differentiation towards the components of skin , with a particular focus on keratinocytes . We highlight fundamental advances in the ﬁ eld employing patient - derived human induced PSCs ( iPSCs ) and skin organoid generation . Importantly , PSCs allow researchers to model inherited skin diseases in the search for potential treatments . Skin differentiation from human PSCs holds the potential to clarify human skin biology .

Human iPSCs are akin to embryonic stem cells ( ESCs ) in their unlimited proliferation capacity and ability to differentiate into the three different embryonic lineages - endoderm , mesoderm , and ectoderm - the latter two being precursors of dermis and epidermis of the skin , respectively . It is expected that human pluripotent stem cells ( PSCs ) will be able to recapitulate the complexity of human skin ( Khurana et al . , 2021 ) . Research on skin reconstructed from PSCs can be translated to develop clinical strategies that may alleviate skin inherited diseases .

Here , we will discuss key issues in the differentiation of human PSCs into keratinocytes and the derivation of disease - speci ﬁ c or patient - derived human iPSCs and skin organoid generation . 2 Basic biology of the skin The skin epidermis is an organ conformed by the interfollicular epidermis ( IFE ) and associated appendages such as hair follicles , sweat glands , and sebaceous glands ( Figure 1 ) , which provide sensory perception and lubrication , among other important physiologic functions ( Fujiwara et al . , 2018 ) . The cellular entity of the skin epidermis is the keratinocyte , which possesses cell plasticity that allows it to regenerate and recreate the tissue during homeostasis and upon injury . The skin epidermis is maintained by epidermal stem cells located at the basal layer and in the vicinity of skin appendages . Epidermal stem cells undergo cell division to self - renew and generate fast - dividing keratinocyte progenitor cells that repopulate the tissue during homeostasis and upon injury ( Solanas and Benitah , 2013 ) . The epidermis is composed of four histologically distinct layers ( Figure 1 , right ) . The basal layer contains stem cells and keratinocyte progenitor cells that can be identi ﬁ ed by the expression of Keratin 5 and Keratin 14 ( K5 / K14 ) heterodimers . As keratinocytes from the basal layer commit to differentiate terminally , they migrate to the suprabasal or spinous layer , whose cells are densely interconnected by desmosomes and are characterized by expression of K1 / K10 and Involucrin . Immediately above this layer lies the granular layer , which expresses Filaggrin and Loricrin proteins which are precursors of the skin barrier . Furthermost above resides the corni ﬁ ed layer composed of anucleated cells that form a lipid barrier layer which provides the mechanical defense character of the skin . Juxtaposed to the basal layer of the epidermis resides the dermis , a layer of connective tissue composed of ﬁ broblasts , blood vessels , nerves , and immune cells . Dermis and epidermis are separated by a basement membrane , which consists mainly of four subtypes of extracellular matrix ( ECM ) proteins : Laminin , Collagen type IV , Nidogen , and Perlecan , which are deposited by epidermal and dermal cells and serve both as an anchoring structure to the basal epidermal cells while also providing signaling cues that determine cell fate and function ( Chen and Gumbiner , 2006 ; Watt and Fujiwara , 2011 ; Breitkreutz et al . , 2013 ) . The vertebrate skin epidermis originates from the embryonic surface ectoderm , which is a single layer of ectodermal cells covering the embryo after neurulation . The surface ectoderm consists of ﬂ at cells that form a simple epithelium characterized by the expression of K8 / K18 heterodimer ( Moll et al . , 1982 and reviewed in Liu et al . , 2013 ; Koster and Roop , 2007 ) . The expression of the transcription factor ( TF ) TP63 is an early event during skin development . TP63 regulates the proliferation of epithelial stem cells and is essential for skin differentiation . TP63 knockout mice showed abnormalities in epidermis development and strati ﬁ cation resulting in neonatal death , possibly due to dehydration ( Mills et al . , 1999 ; Yang et al . , 1999 ) . Two alternative promoters regulate the expression of TP63 isoforms . TA - p63 contains an N - terminal transactivation domain ( TA ) with high homology to TP53 , while the dN - p63 isoform lacks the TA domain ( Yang et al . , 1998 ) . Both TP63 isoforms are expressed in the developing epidermis and positively in ﬂ uence the expression of K14 . TA - p63 mediates K14 promoter transactivation by TFAP - 2 γ , and dN - p63 binds an enhancer in the K14 promoter to activate expression ( Byrne et al . , 1994 ; Koster and Roop , 2007 ) . The expression of K5 / K14 heterodimer coincides with the decline of K8 / K18 expression , an event that hallmarks the commitment to epidermal fate ( Liu et al . , 2013 ) . 3 Differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into dermal and epidermal lineages In the following sections , we will discuss three main approaches to differentiate human pluripotent stem cells ( PSCs ) into epidermal lineages ( Table 1 ) . First , we summarize in vitro differentiation protocols using human iPSCs or ESCs with functional outcomes . The second section reports differentiation protocols using direct conversion . The third section details differentiation protocols leading to 3D - skin organoids . In all cases , variations in the ECM utilized , supplementing compounds , and the medium employed are included in Table 1 . A full list of differentiation protocols is provided in Supplementary Table S1 . 3 . 1 In vitr o differentiation 3 . 1 . 1 Morphogen - mediated induction of early skin Studies of embryonic skin development using various animal models have helped identify appropriate culture conditions for PSC differentiation along the necessary lineages to recreate the layers of the skin . Retinoic acid ( RA ) ful ﬁ lls many important functions during the development of epidermis , the limbs , and the secondary palate ( Mammadova et al . , 2016 ) . Impaired skin differentiation and abnormal strati ﬁ cation were observed in mice overexpressing a dominant - negative form of the retinoic acid receptor ( RAR ) under the regulation of the Keratin 14 promoter , capable of inhibiting the endogenous activities of RAR α , β , and γ ( Saitou et al . , 1995 ) . Andrews reported that treating human ESCs with RA was suf ﬁ cient to induce differentiation into neural ectoderm lineages ( Andrews , 1984 ) . Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology frontiersin . org 02 Oceguera - Yanez et al . 10 . 3389 / fcell . 2022 . 1030339 Palecek and others applied RA to differentiate human ESCs into keratinocytes resulting in a signi ﬁ cant increase in the number of cells expressing dN - p63 and KRT14 , followed by expression of the terminal epidermal differentiation markers KRT10 , Involucrin and Filaggrin ( Metallo et al . , 2008 ) . Furthermore , topical application of RA to human epidermal keratinocytes cultured in vitro sustained expression of the dN - p63a isoform and stimulated proliferation of skin progenitor cells ( Bamberger et al . , 2002 ) . In vivo , BMP4 works both as a potent inducer of the epidermis and also as a neuralization inhibitor ( Wilson and Hemmati - Brivanlou , 1995 ) . It has been shown that BMP4 induces transactivation of the dN - p63 promoter in Zebra ﬁ sh and Xenopus , and positively balances fate commitment from neural into non - neural ectoderm ( Bakkers et al . , 2002 ; Tribulo et al . , 2012 ) . BMP4 treatment induces apoptosis in mouse Sox - 1 + ve neural ectoderm progenitors , thus favoring the development of epidermal lineages and limb appendages ( Gambaro et al . , 2006 ) . Therefore , BMP4 determines commitment of the epidermis during embryonic development ( Itoh et al . , 2011 ; Kajiwara et al . , 2017 ; Larribere et al . , 2017 ) . WNT is an important morphogen controlling different events of development and stem cell behavior . WNT elicits decisive signals on the ectoderm layer to de ﬁ ne whether neural or epidermal lineage will form ( Wilson et al . , 2001 ; Lim and Nusse , 2013 ) . WNT signals prevent the inhibitory actions of FGF on BMP expression , and thereby favor the commitment of epidermis while opposing formation of neural lineages . Notwithstanding the important roles for WNT signaling in the generation of epidermis , there are few reports describing the use or application of WNT agonists in the differentiation of PSCs to epidermal cells . Chen and others described in their protocol that addition of CHIR99021 , a WNT pathway activator , could work together with BMP4 stimulation and TGF β inhibition to induce robust TP63 expression and at the same time decreased the expression of PAX6 . Thus , WNT activation balances the determination of the epidermal lineages while suppressing the neural fate ( Zhong et al . , 2020 ) , The aforementioned reports pioneered the development of keratinocyte differentiation protocols from PSCs . More recently , through the application of various techniques such as RNA - seq , single - cell pro ﬁ ling , and automated light microscopy allowed to study early skin development and enabled manipulation of the signaling pathways involved in the lineage determination from pluripotency to surface ectoderm and ultimately commitment to skin keratinocytes ( Figure 2 ) . 3 . 1 . 2 Modulation of skin development Based on the important role of TP63 during epidermis development , studies of dominant - negative TP63 isoforms should help reveal key events occurring during skin morphogenesis . Fibroblasts obtained from patients suffering from ectrodactyly , ectodermal dysplasia and cleft lip / palate ( EEC ) syndrome caused by somatic mutations in the DNA - binding domain of TP63 , were reprogrammed to iPSCs ( Soares et al . , 2019 ) . It was observed that EEC syndrome iPSCs were incapable to differentiating to epithelial or epidermal lineages when induced in vitro . Bulk and single - cell RNA seq analyses were performed in order to pro ﬁ le the differences during epidermis differentiation between normal and EEC patient iPSCs . The study identi ﬁ ed sets of genes regulated by FIGURE 1 Basic biology of the skin .

EEC - iPSCs showed elevated expression of mesodermal genes such as vimentin ( VIM ) and matrix metalloproteinase family ( MMP ) and were correlated with non - epithelial cells such as skeletal muscle myoblasts , lung ﬁ broblasts , or umbilical vein endothelial cells . The above observations strongly suggested that TP63 activates epithelial and epidermal genes and possibly represses mesodermal genes during skin development . The results of the study informed the authors to apply compounds known to repress mesoderm induction , such as heparin , suramin , and valproic acid ( VA ) . Heparin can bind and sequester FGFs , suramin is a potent inhibitor of VEGF and FGFs , and VA is a histone deacetylase inhibitor that up - regulates H3 acetylation and represses EMT . When the inhibitors were included in the differentiation medium of EEC patient iPSCs , epithelial differentiation was restored enabling the expression of the epidermal genes KRT5 , EDAR2 , DSG3 , and LAMA3 ( Soares et al . , 2019 ) . Horsley and others performed experiments using transgenic mice and human ESC differentiation in parallel to analyze the early stages of surface ectoderm commitment towards keratinocytes and identi ﬁ ed Notch signaling activity prior to TP63 expression ( Tadeu and Horsley , 2013 ) . Following application of DAPT , a γ - secretase inhibitor that blocks Notch signaling , the expression of TP63 increased during the initial stages of surface ectoderm determination of both human ESCs and mouse embryonic skin ( Tadeu and Horsley , 2013 ) . In a follow - up study , RNA - sequence analysis characterized the transcriptional pro ﬁ les of human ESCs differentiated with BMP4 under γ - secretase inhibition . Treatment of human ESCs with DAPT induced an early adoption of surface ectoderm fate caused by expression of a set of transcription factors for development of epidermis including IRF6 , important for normal skin , limb , and craniofacial morphogenesis and TP63 , DLX3 , BARX2 , EDAR , and SFN which regulate epidermal keratinocyte fate induction ( Tadeu et al . , 2015 ) . Epidermis - mesenchymal interactions were also identi ﬁ ed in the analysis , such as LMX1 , whose expression induces a dorsal epidermal fate in the vertebrate limb , and PTN , which is a mesenchymal regulator of epithelial embryonic development ( Tadeu et al . , 2015 ) . Various groups have converged on a common pitfall while performing epidermis differentiation experiments using PSCs , namely decreased proliferation capacity following differentiation ( Itoh et al . , 2011 ; Kidwai et al . , 2013 ; Sebastiano et al . , 2014 and reviewed in Rheinwald , 2013 and Khurana et al . , 2021 ) . Indeed , it was suggested that cell expansion may be limited by telomere length shortening and cell senescence mechanisms ( Kidwai et al . , 2013 ) . For example , p16 INK4A activates and imposes a break in keratinocyte proliferation that can be alleviated by overexpression of BMI1 , a repressor of p16 INK4A , and p14 ARF signals ( Movahednia et al . , 2015 ) . Recently , Sah et al . ( 2021 ) reported the generation of single iPSCs into homogenously differentiated keratinocytes through the addition of RA and BMP4 , thus avoiding the generation of EBs or colony passaging . In order to maintain the proliferative capacity of their human iPSC - derived keratinocytes , they included the ROCK inhibitor Y - 27632 in their culture protocol and were able to achieve moderate passaging of their induced keratinocytes nine times . After increasing the Ca2 + concentration to > 1 . 2 mM in the medium , the keratinocytes expressed terminal differentiation markers KRT1 , Filaggrin , and Loricrin . Ruiz - Torres et al . ( 2021 ) reported the use of a similar protocol to derive epidermal TP63 positive ( + ve ) cells that expressed ITGA6 , ITGB4 , and COL17A1 within 20 days with the capacity to be passaged four times . The resulting cells were capable of forming strati ﬁ ed epidermis that express corni ﬁ ed layer markers TGM1 and TGM2 . The development of systematic studies to identify and overcome proliferation arrest mechanisms may allow the identi ﬁ cation of alternative molecules that improve the proliferation capacity of PSC - derived keratinocytes . β - catenin is a key molecule of Wnt signaling , serving a pivotal role by changing localization between the nucleus and membrane . When localized at the membrane , β - catenin interacts with E - cadherin and controls the structure and FIGURE 2 Differentiation of pluripotent stem cells to skin keratinocytes . Scheme showing the transition from a pluripotency state to epidermal keratinocytes incorporating morphogen - induction and compound induction of skin epidermis . The cell markers characteristic of the cell state is described below the drawings . Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology frontiersin . org 05 Oceguera - Yanez et al . 10 . 3389 / fcell . 2022 . 1030339 mechano - transduction of adherens junctions . When localized in the nucleus , β - catenin interacts with transcription factors and transactivates the expression of WNT / β - catenin responsive genes ( Valenta et al . , 2012 ) . Tyrosine kinases can also control the spatio - temporal localization of β - catenin and its interaction with E - cadherin through phosphorylating β - catenin at Y654 residue . Application of the Src kinase inhibitor ( SU6656 ) to pluripotent cells increased membrane - bound β - catenin , resulting in epithelial cells expressing KRT8 and KRT18 ( Lian et al . , 2013 ) , while OCT3 / 4 expression was downregulated . Interestingly , the epithelial cells were able to undergo surface ectoderm differentiation upon treatment with RA and BMP4 in the differentiation media , generating either KRT14 epidermal or KRT3 corneal epithelial progenitors . Importantly , the progenitor cells could be expanded in culture to about 24 population doublings ( Lian et al . , 2013 ; Selekman et al . , 2016 ) . Although this process can generate multipotent epithelial progenitor cells , it enables the production of a great number of cells that could later commit to epidermal keratinocyte lineage . A microscopy - based screen combined with RNA interference investigated the roles of kinases and kinase - regulatory proteins in early skin epithelial differentiation ( Larribere et al . , 2017 ) . The screen was designed to identify molecules that in ﬂ uence the generation of KRT18 + ve cells and thereby improve epithelial progenitor cell generation . They identi ﬁ ed 35 previously reported genes which function in epidermis differentiation , including BMP receptors , IKK - related genes , and MAPKs , validating the study ( Larribere et al . , 2017 ) . HIPK4 , a homeodomain interacting protein kinase 4 , was identi ﬁ ed as a crucial inhibitor of KRT18 expression . HIPK4 expression was detected in the developing skin of E17 . 5 mouse embryos . Down - regulation of HIPK4 using RNAi was found to substantially increase the number of KRT18 + ve cells from 50 % to 85 % after differentiation induction , although KRT14 + ve cells increased only moderately from 50 % to 65 % . Transcriptome pro ﬁ ling of HIPK4 knockdown samples identi ﬁ ed IL - 6 and TGF β / BMP as signaling pathways that could be increased in a HIPK4 - dependent manner ( Larribere et al . , 2017 ) . Similar experimental efforts may lead to better understand the signals required for epidermal morphogenesis and will likely aid in the improvement of differentiation protocols in the future . 3 . 1 . 3 Differentiation into dermal ﬁ broblasts Proper formation of human skin requires the mutual interaction of epidermal and dermal cells . An elaborate protocol to derive dermal ﬁ broblasts was described ( Nakajima et al . , 2018 ; Nakajima et al . , 2019 ) . The authors followed the rational provided by developmental cues identi ﬁ ed in chick and mouse embryos undergoing somitogenesis . Induction of somitic mesoderm was initiated by the addition of a combination of chemical compounds including an inhibitor of TGF β ( SB431542 ) , a GSK3 β inhibitor to mimic WNT activation ( CHIR99021 ) , and a BMP antagonist ( DMH1 ) . Dermomyotome cells were identi ﬁ ed by expression of Engrailed 1 ( EN1 ) and PDGFRa receptor . Subsequent addition of BMP4 and CHIR99021 enabled the generation of dermal ﬁ broblasts . The resulting cells expressed Collagen I and Hyaluronic acid . Alternative attempts at reconstituting skin from PSCs involved layering ﬁ broblasts and keratinocytes differentiated from iPSCs ( Kim et al . , 2018 ) . Embryoid bodies prepared from iPSCs were deposited on matrigel , and migrating cells were treated with BMP4 . Selective attachment to non - coated plastic followed by Collagen I adhesion led to cells with ﬁ broid morphology . The resulting ﬁ broblasts expressed CD105 , CD73 , and CD44 , and were capable of secreting the extracellular matrix proteins ﬁ bronectin and vimentin . iPSC - derived ﬁ broblasts were immersed in Collagen I gels and cultured on tissue culture inserts overlayed with iPSC - keratinocytes and later exposed to the air - liquid interface to allow reconstitute the different layers of epidermis in vitro . Transplanting the skin generated in vitro onto immunode ﬁ cient mice resulted in the expression of mature markers K14 , Loricrin and Involucrin , functionally validating the assay . Christiano and others reported an alternate protocol to derive ﬁ broblasts from iPSCs . By allowing iPSCs to form embryoid bodies in medium including TGF β 2 and ascorbic acid , ﬁ broblast - like cells developed ( Itoh et al . , 2013 ) . The majority of differentiated ﬁ broblasts expressed the dermal ﬁ broblast markers CD10 , CD44 , CD73 and CD90 . These iPSC - ﬁ broblasts were functionally tested by grafting onto the back of SCID mice in combination with normal human keratinocytes , and resulted in reconstitution of skin expressing Keratin 1 , Loricrin and Collagen VII at the basement mebrane . Ascorbic acid has been reported to induce mesodermal lineages from PSCs and also to enhance Collagen synthesis , an important measure of ECM deposition by dermal ﬁ broblasts ( Shamis et al . , 2012 ) , Importantly , the PSC - derived ﬁ broblasts that developed were able to support the growth and strati ﬁ cation of 3D - reconstituted skin when co - cultured with iPSC - keratinocytes ( Itoh et al . , 2013 ; Kim et al . , 2018 ) . 3 . 2 Direct conversion and directed differentiation Direct conversion is a process whereby cells undergo cell - fate changes from their current developmental lineage onto a different and unrelated somatic state . Direct conversion may be facilitated by overexpression of a lineage - de ﬁ ned cocktail of transcription factors ( TFs ) , such as Ascl1 , Pou3f2 and Myt1l for converting mouse ﬁ broblasts into functional neurons in vitro ( Vierbuchen and Wernig , 2011 ) . Conversion of human ﬁ broblasts to keratinocytes was achieved by the overexpression of two TFs , TP63 and KLF4 ( Chen et al . , 2014 ) . The resulting keratinocytes expressed KRT5 / Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology frontiersin . org 06 Oceguera - Yanez et al . 10 . 3389 / fcell . 2022 . 1030339 KRT14 and global gene expression pro ﬁ ling con ﬁ rmed similarities with epidermal keratinocytes . TFs may also be used to direct differentiation of PSCs into a variety of somatic lineages including skeletal muscle by the overexpression of MyoD ( Tanaka et al . , 2013 ) , or cortical neurons by overexpression of Ngn2 ( Kondo et al . , 2017 ) , or combined expression of Ascl1 , Pou3f2 and Myt1l and NeuroD1 ( Pang et al . , 2011 ) . Direct conversion of mouse ﬁ broblasts into functional keratinocytes has been described ( Iacovides et al . , 2016 ) . In their approach , transient expression of pluripotency - associated TFs Sox2 , Oct4 and Klf4 initiated transcriptional reprograming towards pluripotency and was followed by the addition of RA and BMP4 into keratinocyte medium to induce MEF conversion along an ectodermal fate ( Iacovides et al . , 2016 ) . Conversion of human ﬁ broblasts to keratinocyte stem - like cells was also reported via brief overexpression of the reprogramming factors Oct4 , Sox2 , Klf4 , and c - Myc using retroviruses ( Zhao et al . , 2020 ) , followed by the addition of RA , BMP4 , hEGF , and bFGF into keratinocyte medium . The resulting keratinocytes expressed ITG β 1 and KRT19 , and upon increasing the extracellular Ca2 + concentration the cells upregulated KRT1 and downregulated KRT14 ( Zhao et al . , 2020 ) . Since KRT19 is associated with periderm development , it is possible that the approach generated early epidermal lineages ( Moll et al . , 1982 ) . More recently , it was reported that decreasing the expression of KLF4 using siRNA resulted in retardation of the terminal differentiation program with augmented proliferation of immature keratinocytes derived from ESCs ( Fortunel et al . , 2019 ) . The function of Klf4 in mouse skin was initially ascribed as a transcription factor involved in the establishment of the corni ﬁ ed layer of the epidermis , as Klf4 was found to repress the expression of proteins involved in the corni ﬁ ed envelope formation - related protein Sprr2 ( Segre et al . , 1999 ) . Thus , Klf4 can exert different functions during skin epidermis development , suggesting future applications to improve PSC differentiation to epidermis . Kurita et al . ( 2018 ) reported the reprograming of dermal ﬁ broblasts and adipose - derived stromal cells into keratinocytes with the aim of restoring wound closure for the treatment of large cutaneous ulcers . Amongst 55 TFs , four key TFs , dN - p63A , GRHL2 , TFAP2 - A and cMYC ( DGTM ) , were identi ﬁ ed and delivered by lentiviral particles into the mesenchymal cells resident in wounds generated on the back of mice . When mice were wounded to generate arti ﬁ cial ulcers and treated with the DGTM cocktail , the mesenchymal cells changed onto a keratinocyte lineage expressing Keratin 14 . The newly formed epithelial cells closed the wound and strati ﬁ ed to form a suprabasal layer of cells expressing Keratin 13 , which progressively switched to express the adult epidermal Keratin 10 . The barrier permeability test based on Toluidine blue dye incorporation showed that the generated epidermis excluded the dye from the inner tissue layers and therefore compares functionally with that of skin epidermis formed with primary keratinocytes ( Kurita et al . , 2018 ) . This work has a great potential to contribute to the medical ﬁ eld in the treatment of chronic ulcers , thermal burns and surgical incisions , amongst many other applications . Alternative skin resident cell lineages such as melanocytes have also been induced by overexpression of three transcription factors into human ﬁ broblast . The TFs SOX10 , MITF and PAX3 were identi ﬁ ed after screening a pool of candidate transcription factors related to neural crest lineage determination and were suf ﬁ cient to reprogram human ﬁ broblasts to functional melanocytes ( iMels ) . The resulting melanocytes are capable of generating melanosomes and transferring melanin granules into the surrounding keratinocytes in 3D - reconstituted skin and skin reconstitution assays in mice in vivo ( Yang et al . , 2014 ) . 3 . 3 3D - skin organoids Organogenesis of skin appendages occurs early in embryonic development through a series of reciprocal interactions between the dermis and epidermis , and the roles of FGFs , TGF β s , sonic hedgehog ( Shh ) and BMP signaling molecules in these processes has been established previously ( Kishimoto et al . , 1999 ) . Therefore , reconstituting these two main components of the skin is expected to improve organogenesis of skin appendages . Tsuji and others performed a variety of experiments to reconstitute the skin and associated appendages . Embryoid bodies ( EBs ) generated with mouse iPSCs , immersed within a collagen gel were grafted as clusters into the subrenal capsule of severe combined immunode ﬁ cient ( SCID ) mice ( Takagi et al . , 2016 ) . Gastric , respiratory and skin epithelium could be generated . Interestingly , treatment of EBs with WNT10b increased the number and maturity of hair follicles and associated structures such as dermal papillae and sebaceous glands . The subsequent orthotopic transplant of the skin organ system generated into the back skin of nude mice allowed the engraftment of bioengineered hair follicles and establishment of connections with arrector pili muscles within the recipient mice , highlighting important functional properties . Recently , skin organoid generation was reported using aggregates of human iPSCs ( Lee et al . , 2020 ) . Treatment of iPSC EBs with BMP4 to induce surface ectoderm gave rise to epidermis , followed by a morphogen cocktail containing FGF2 to induce cranial neural crest cells that eventually converted into dermis . After allowing the aggregates to mature in culture for 70 days , a variety of appendages were identi ﬁ ed that included hair follicles pigmented by melanocytes , innervating neurons , and sebaceous glands . Because the neural crest develops into cranial dermis , the described hair follicles resembled facial beard and ear hair . The work provided proof of concept of the potential of iPSCs to regenerate skin appendages , and underscores the capability of such systems to test adequate morphogens in an orderly manner to derive skin from different locations in the human body ( Lee Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology frontiersin . org 07 Oceguera - Yanez et al . 10 . 3389 / fcell . 2022 . 1030339 et al . , 2020 ; Sun et al . , 2021 ; Lee et al . , 2022 ) . Ebner - Peking et al . ( 2021 ) reported the assembly of skin spheroid organoids containing vasculature by culturing together human iPSCs - derived keratinocytes , ﬁ broblasts , and endothelial cells . Once assembled , the completely iPSC - derived skin organoids were grafted into immune - de ﬁ cient mice . Three months later , the histology showed a clear epidermal and dermal organization containing Ki67 + ve proliferating hiPSC - derived epidermal cells . The dermis developed from hiPSCs showed an intricate vasculature identi ﬁ ed by human - speci ﬁ c anti - CD31 antibodies in immunostaining experiments ( Ebner - Peking et al . , 2021 ) . Despite the rapid advances in the development of skin organoids , they still lack crucial features for expanding their use . As described by Lee and Koehler ( 2021 ) , a shared pitfall of the current organoid models reside in the absence of relevant cell populations , such as endothelial cells , pericytes , and immune cells ( eg . , Langerhans cells and T cells ) ; skin organoids are de ﬁ cient of vasculature and sweat glands development , thus opening new avenues for research . 4 Disease modeling Inherited disorders of the skin are generally caused by mutations in the genes encoding for intermediate ﬁ laments and structural proteins such as keratins or collagens . They span a diverse group of blistering and dis ﬁ guring diseases and affect many individuals in every ethnic group ( Morren et al . , 2022 ) . The use of iPSCs for the development of personalized medicine therapies holds great promise in the treatment of diseases caused by genetic disorders ( Khurana et al . , 2021 ) , and a clear understanding of the pathways affected will help to develop therapeutic cures . The dermatology ﬁ eld could bene ﬁ t from making use of banks of iPSCs already generated from different diseases ( Seltmann et al . , 2016 ; De Sousa et al . , 2017 ) . In Supplementary Table S2 we present examples of iPSC - derived skin disease models and highlight the cell lineages differentiated to reach the research outcome . Recently , iPSCs - derived skin organoids have been applied as novel tools for disease modeling and drug screening . Ramovs et al . ( 2022 ) reported the characterization of hair - bearing skin organoids by reproducing the protocol of Lee et al . ( 2020 ) and carefully examining the epidermal - dermal junction to evaluate the suitability of skin organoids to model diseases such as epidermolysis bullosa ( EB ) . The skin organoids displayed a fully strati ﬁ ed interfollicular epidermis , however , the epidermal - dermal junctions reconstituted were almost devoid of Collagen VII , indicating their incomplete maturation ; a potential complication for EB modeling . Ma et al . ( 2022 ) developed iPSC - derived epidermal and mesenchymal - like organoids following the protocol of Lee et al . ( 2020 ) and grafted them into a localized scleroderma mouse model with the goal of alleviating disease symptoms . Localized scleroderma presents as a connective tissue disease represented by ﬁ brosis and abnormalities in the immune system and blood vessels and can be induced in mice by Bleomycin injection . It was reported that scleroderma mice grafted with skin organoids showed a decrease in the levels of in ﬂ ammatory cytokines , a reduced accumulation of abnormal ECM deposition accordant with an increase in blood vessel development ( Ma et al . , 2022 ) . Thus , the application of skin organoids into localized scleroderma may help to discern therapeutic strategies . 5 Future perspectives Despite the diversity of keratinocyte differentiation protocols , most converge on the manipulation of a handful of signaling pathways controlling early skin morphogenesis . Beyond this , we propose alternative strategies to be implemented for the improvement of in vitro keratinocyte differentiation from human PSCs . Human iPSCs from different sources demonstrate variability in differentiation ef ﬁ ciency ( Osafune et al . , 2008 ; Hu et al . , 2010 ; Bock et al . , 2011 ) . While optimization of morphogen or small molecule concentrations may resolve these differences , it is recommended that different PSCs be tested for their differentiation propensity towards the desired lineage . Epigenetic memory may play an important role ( Kim et al . , 2011 ) . The intrinsic capability of keratinocyte - derived iPSCs to generate keratinocytes was applied advantageously , although the impairment in proliferation of the pluripotent - epidermal derivatives still remained an important issue ( Sebastiano et al . , 2014 ; Matsumura et al . , 2018 ) . Naïve PSCs show markedly reduced H3K27me3 transcriptional silencing histone marks compared to primed PSCs ( Ware , 2017 ) . It is therefore hypothesized that naïve PSCs may have improved potential to differentiate into any speci ﬁ c developmental lineage due to resetting of their epigenetic status . Recent technical advances in single cell sequencing and analyses of nuclear chromatin organization have offered clarity on the succession of events underlying epidermis and dermis communication ( Fan et al . , 2018 ) . We expect that further studies will uncover the processes of human skin morphogenesis , which in turn could be applied to broadly improve differentiation protocols . The generation of reporter PSC lines that enable quantitative comparisons of differentiation capacity can aid in comparisons of various differentiation protocols . A relevant example is provided by the generation of a TP63 knock - in human iPSC line that permitted the identi ﬁ cation of cell lineages expressing TP63 during corneal epithelial development ( Kobayashi et al . , 2017 ) . Similar approaches to generate knock - in ﬂ uorescent reporters for epidermal genes will prove bene ﬁ cial for the comparison and standardization of protocols to generate iPSC - derived epidermal keratinocytes . Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology frontiersin . org 08 Oceguera - Yanez et al . 10 . 3389 / fcell . 2022 . 1030339 6 Conclusion Our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms regulating PSC differentiation towards keratinocytes and skin appendages has expanded in the last decade , driven by advances in iPSC technologies and developmental biology . As evidenced by several reports reviewed herein , PSC research has led to the development of a broad toolkit of differentiation methods capable of generating functional keratinocytes , ﬁ broblasts , and even the formation of complex skin organoids . As further re ﬁ nement of PSC differentiation strategies will open a path to regenerative medicine for skin wounds and disease , challenging current barriers is necessary and warranted in the ﬁ eld .
