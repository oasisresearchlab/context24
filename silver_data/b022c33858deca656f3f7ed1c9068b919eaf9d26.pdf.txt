Interstitial DC migration is directionally guided by chemokines , but independent of speciﬁc adhesive in - teractions with the tissue as well as peri - cellular proteolysis . Instead , the protru - sive ﬂow of the actin cytoskeleton directly drives a basal mode of locomotion that is occasionally supported by actomyosin contractions at the trailing edge to propel the cell’s rigid nucleus . We here delete the small GTPase Cdc42 in DCs and ﬁnd that actin ﬂow and actomyosin contrac - tion are still initiated in response to che - motactic cues . Accordingly , the cells are able to polarize and form protrusions . However , in the absence of Cdc42 the protrusions are temporally and spatially dysregulated , which leads to impaired leading edge coordination . Although this defect still allows the cells to move on 2 - dimensional surfaces , their in vivo mo - tility is completely abrogated . We show that this difference is entirely caused by the geometric complexity of the environ - ment , as multiple competing protrusions leadtoinstantaneousentanglementwithin 3 - dimensional extracellular matrix scaf - folds . This demonstrates that the deci - sive factor for migrating DCs is not spe - ciﬁc interaction with the extracellular environment , but adequate coordination of cytoskeletal ﬂow . ( Blood . 2009 ; 113 : 5703 - 5710 ) Introduction Cells of the hematopoietic lineage are fundamentally different from mesenchymal or epithelial cells . Many of them are not restricted to a speciﬁc tissue compartment , but rather circulate through the whole organism to perform surveillance or renewal functions . The difference between resident and mobile cells is reﬂected by the fact that mesenchymal and epithelial cells are constitutively adherent to speciﬁc extracellular substrates , whereas hematopoietic cells can ﬂexibly accommodate their adhesive properties . 1 Dendritic cells ( DCs ) are excellent examples for both principles as their function relies on the switch from the sessile to the motile state . 2 The sessile immature DC samples antigens in peripheral tissues . Endogenous or exogenous danger signals trigger the differentiation into the motile state and at the same time induce the expression of the CC - chemokine receptor 7 ( CCR7 ) that directionally guides the cells through the interstitium of the dermis and via the lymphatic vessels into the T - cell area of the lymph node . 3 , 4 In the T - cell area , DCs present the peripherally acquired antigens to naive T cells and upon cognate interaction instruct T - cell differentiation and prolifera - tion . Acquisition of the motile state in DCs is accompanied by a functional deactivation of cell - cell adhesion and integrin receptors that allows the cells to detach from their substrates and move freely through the dermal interstitium . 5 - 7 Nonadhesiveness endows the cells with enormous ﬂexibility as they become autonomous from the molecular composition of their environment and can directly follow soluble guidance cues like chemokines . We could recently show that nonadhesive DC migration in 3 - dimensional ( 3D ) environments can be driven solely by the protrusive ﬂow of actin polymerization at the cell front , whereas actomyosin contractions of the trailing edge served to propel the nucleus through narrow spaces . 7 Theoretic modeling conﬁrmed that within conﬁned envi - ronments actomyosin dynamics can directly drive cellular locomo - tion without requiring transmembrane force coupling via adhesion receptors . 8 The fact that 2 - dimensional ( 2D ) surfaces , as often used to study cell migration , cannot support such nonadhesive move - ment explains that cell biology has largely neglected the underlying mechanisms . The migration of leukocytes is likely to be more simplistic than that of adherent cells , as in 3D environments the sheer initiation and polarization of actin ﬂow together with cortical shape changes likely explain most of its aspects . The universally expressed small GTPases Rac , RhoA , and Cdc42 are commonly accepted to be the key switches determining cell shape . 9 , 10 One of their main functions is the coordination of the actin cytoskeleton and closely interrelated phenomena such as adhesion and microtubule dynamics . It is ﬁrmly established that the Rac family members are essential for actin polymerization and RhoA regulates actomyosin contractility . 10 Both effects have been demonstrated in DCs : Abolishing Rac activity in mature DCs by genetically deleting the 2 expressed isoforms Rac1 and Rac2 leads to rounding and concomitant immobility of the cells , 11 which is in line with completely abrogated actin polymerization dynamics . Blockade of RhoA downstream effectors leaves actin protrusion at the leading edge intact , but affects the trailing edge of mature DCs and neutrophils . Here , actomyosin contraction is required to perform squeezing contractions to propel the cell’s rigid nucleus through small pores . 7 The roles of Cdc42 are less clear cut and many functions such as ﬁlopodia formation appear to be cell type – speciﬁc . 12 The most conserved function of Cdc42 is the coordination of the polarity SubmittedNovember26 , 2008 ; acceptedJanuary23 , 2009 .

Here , a positive feedback loop has been described whereupon G protein – coupled receptor signaling the kinase PAK1 recruits the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (cid:1) PIX , which activates Cdc42 that in turn positively regulates PAK1 activity . 20 In T cells , Cdc42 is activated by Rap1 and induces the Par polarity complex consisting of Par3 , Par6 , and PKC (cid:2) . This triggers Tiam1 , which connects the Par polarity complex to Rap1 at sites of polarity initiation . 21 Although Cdc42 has not been deleted in DCs until now , studies using dominant - negative versions of the molecule revealed defects in the endocytotic pathway , 22 antigen presentation , 23 podosome formation , 24 and dendrite formation 25 of immature DCs . Using DCs deﬁcient for Cdc42 , we here address the question of how coordination of actin ﬂow inﬂuences migration . Whereas chemotactic movement of Cdc42 - deﬁcient DCs is only moderately impaired in 2D assays , it is completely abolished in the dermal interstitium . We show that the severe phenotype results from a defective coordination of multiple protrusions that leads to entangle - ment in the 3D ﬁbrillar network . These ﬁndings demonstrate that the internal stabilization of polarity becomes increasingly impor - tant when the cells have to navigate through geometrically complex environments . Methods Animals Conditional Cdc42 ﬂox / ﬂox mice 26 were intercrossed with Mx1Cre transgenic mice 27 to generate Cdc42 ﬂox / ﬂox Mx1Cre (cid:3) / (cid:4) animals and kept on a mixed 129SV / C57BL / 6 genetic background . Control animals were littermates ( Cdc42 ﬂox / ﬂox Mx1Cre (cid:4) / (cid:4) or Cdc42 ﬂox / (cid:3) Mx1Cre (cid:3) / (cid:4) ) . At an age between 6 and 10 weeks , mice received a single intraperitoneal injection of 250 (cid:5) g Poly ( I ) (cid:1) Poly ( C ) ( 250 (cid:5) g ; GE Healthcare , Little Chalfont , United King - dom ) , diluted in 0 . 5 mL phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) . Mice were killed 10 to 14 days after injection . The mice were bred in a conventional animal facility at the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry and according to the local regulations . Mouse breeding and all experimental procedures were approved by the Regierung von Oberbayern . Dendritic cells DCs were generated from ﬂushed bone marrow ( BM ) suspension as previously described in detail . 7 , 28 At days 8 to 10 of culture , 200 ng / mLLPS ( Sigma - Aldrich , Munich , Germany ; Escherichia coli 0127 : B8 ) was added for 24 hours , and subsequently the culture was depleted of remaining Gr - 1 (cid:3) contaminant cells . For depletion , cells were incubated with biotinylated antibodies against Gr - 1 ( RB6 - 8C5 ; BD Pharmingen , Heidelberg , Ger - many ) , followed by anti – biotin - microbead separation according to the manufacturer’s protocol ( Miltenyi Biotec , Bergisch Gladbach , Germany ) . The puriﬁed DCs were used for migration assays . To determine knockout efﬁciencies , DC lysates were loaded on 12 % polyacrylamide gels for electrophoresis under reduced conditions and Western blotting . Cdc42 was detected with mouse anti – mouse Cdc42 antibody ( clone 44 ; BD Transduc - tion Laboratories , Heidelberg , Germany ) , and the loading control was performed with rabbit anti – mouse actin antibody ( A2066 ; Sigma - Aldrich ) . Bound primary antibodies were detected with anti – mouse or anti – rabbit horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ; both Bio - Rad , Hercules , CA ) as secondary antibodies , followed by chemiluminescence with Western Lightning Re - agent Plus ( PerkinElmer , Boston , MA ) . Only DC batches without detect - able Cdc42 signal were chosen for experiments . Maturation of DCs was analyzed by ﬂow cytometry using antibodies against the mouse antigens : CD11c ( HL3 , FITC - conjugated ) , I - A / I - E ( 2G9 ) , CD40 ( 3 / 23 ) , CD86 ( GL1 ; all PE - conjugated ; all from BD Pharmingen ) , and CCR7 ( PE - conjugated ; eBiosciences , San Diego , CA ) with the corresponding isotype controls . 7 Flow cytometric analysis was performed with a FACSCalibur and CellQuest Pro Software ( BD Biosciences , San Diego , CA ) . In vivo migration assay Gr - 1 – depleted wild - type ( WT ) and Cdc42 - deﬁcient DCs were labeled with 3 (cid:5) M cell - permeable CellTrace Oregon Green 488 or 1 (cid:5) M tetramethylrho - damine ( TAMRA ; both from Invitrogen , Karlsruhe , Germany ) , respec - tively , and vice versa . DCs ( 10 6 ) at a 1 : 1 ratio were suspended in 20 (cid:5) LPBS and injected subcutaneously into the hind footpads of C57BL / 6 mice . Forty - eight hours after injection , mice were killed by CO 2 suffocation , and popliteal lymph nodes were frozen in cryomatrix ( Thermo , Pittsburgh , PA ) and sectioned in 12 - (cid:5) m slices . To visualize the lymph node compartments , cryosections were methanol - ﬁxed , blocked with 1 % BSA in PBS , and stained with pan - laminin antibody ( L9393 ; Sigma - Aldrich ) and secondary antirabbit Cy5 ( Dianova , Hamburg , Germany ) . Three different layers of the T - cell cortex of each lymph node were documented using an Axio Imager upright microscope ( Zeiss , Jena , Germany ) . Quantiﬁcation of DCs within the T - cell cortex was performed with MetaMorph ( Molecular Devices , Ismaning , Germany ) . Using inverse thresholding , the greyscale images of both ﬂuorescence channels were separately binarized . DCs appeared as dots that were quantiﬁed using the morphometric analysis tool . The ratio of migrated knockout DCs was calculated as the number of knockout cells divided by the total number of DCs in theT - cell cortex , with 0 . 5 as the value where 50 % of knockout cells and 50 % WT cells located in the center of the lymph node , and with 0 as the value where only WT cells located in the T - cell cortex of the lymph node . Ex vivo migration assay Ears of killed C57BL / 6 mice were removed and mechanically split into dorsal and ventral halves . During separation , the dermis detached from the cartilage layer that remained on one of the halves . LPS - matured , BM - derived , magnetic - activated cell sorting ( MACS ) – puriﬁed , TAMRA - labeled DCs were resuspended in culture medium , added on top of the dermis , and incubated for 120 minutes at 37°C , 5 % CO 2 . For immunoﬂuo - rescence stainings , ear sheets were then ﬁxed with 1 % paraformaldehyde , incubated with a rabbit polyclonal anti – LYVE - 1 antibody ( R & D Systems , Wiesbaden , Germany ) , washed with PBS , and stained with A488 - conjugated anti – rabbit secondary antibody ( Invitrogen ) . Images were obtained with a Leica DMIRE2 confocal microscope ( objective HCX PL APO / 40 (cid:6) / 1 . 25 - 0 . 75 oil ; Leica , Wetzlar , Germany ) . Merged z - stacks were generated with the Leica confocal software . For quantiﬁcation of DC numbers within lymphatic vessels , z - stacks were 3D reconstructed , before the intersection of grayscale images from both ﬂuorescence channels was determined , leaving only DCs within lymphatic vessels to be quantiﬁed by integrated morphometry analysis with MetaMorph . In vitro migration assays Three - dimensional collagen gel chemotaxis assays ( Figure 6D ) have been described earlier . 7 PureCol ( INAMED , Fremont , CA ) in 1 (cid:6) minimum essential medium eagle ( Sigma - Aldrich ) and 0 . 4 % sodium bicarbonate ( Sigma - Aldrich ) was mixed with cells in RPMI ( Invitrogen ) , 10 % fetal calf serum ( FCS ; Invitrogen ) at a 2 : 1 ratio , resulting in gels with a collagen concentration of 1 . 6 mg / mL . Final cell concentrations in the assay were 10 6 DCs / mL gel . Collagen - cell mixtures were cast in custom - made migration chambers with a thickness of 0 . 5 to 1 mm . After 30 - minute assembly of the 5704 LA¨MMERMANN et al BLOOD , 4 JUNE 2009 (cid:1) VOLUME 113 , NUMBER 23 For personal use only . on April 15 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From collagen ﬁbers at 37°C , the gels were overlayed with 50 (cid:5) L of 0 . 6 (cid:5) g / mL CCL19 ( R & D Systems ) diluted in RPMI / 10 % FCS . For 3D collagen gel invasion assays ( Figure 6A ) , 2 . 5 (cid:5) g / mL CCL19 was added before polymerization of the 1 . 6 mg / mL collagen gel in a custom - made migration chamber . DCs ( 5 (cid:6) 10 5 ) were placed on top of the collagen gel , and the chamber was incubated in an upright position for 8 hours at 37°C , 5 % CO 2 , before images were taken with an inverted Axiovert 40 ( Zeiss ) . Under - agarose chemotaxis assays ( Figure 3A ) have been performed as described elsewhere . 29 Brieﬂy , 2 . 5 % UltraPure agarose ( Invitrogen ) in distilled water was heated and mixed with 56°C prewarmed RPMI / 20 % FCS and 2 (cid:6) Hank buffered salt solution ( Sigma - Aldrich ) at a 1 : 2 : 1 ratio , resulting in an agarose concentration of 6 . 25 mg / mL . Two microliters of warm agarose - medium mixture was cast in 3 . 5 - cm cell - culture dishes ( BD Falcon , Franklin Lakes , NJ ) and allowed to polymerize at room tempera - ture . A responder hole ( for DCs ) was punched 1 mm from an attractor hole ( for chemokine ) into the agarose . After 30 minutes of equilibration at 37°C , 5 % CO 2 , 5 (cid:6) 10 5 DCs were transferred into the responder hole and 1 . 2 (cid:5) g / mLCCL19wasﬁlledintotheattractorhole . Time - lapsevideomicros - copy was initiated when DCs started to migrate between the cell - culture plastic and the agarose . For under - agarose assays with homogenous chemokine ( Figure 2A ) , 2 . 5 (cid:5) g / mL CCL19 was added when the agarose - medium mixture cooled to 37°C before casting and polymerization . DC suspension ( 1 (cid:5) L ) was injected beneath the agarose with a ﬁne pipette tip , and time - lapse videomicroscopy recording started immediately . Low - magniﬁcation bright - ﬁeld movies of 3D collagen chemotaxis assays and all agarose assays were recorded at indicated time intervals using inverted Axiovert 40 ( Zeiss ) cell - culture microscopes , equipped with custom - built climate chambers ( 5 % CO 2 , 37°C , humidiﬁed ) and PAL cameras ( Prosilica , Burnaby , BC ) triggered by custom - made software ( SVS Vistek , Seefeld , Germany ) . The objectives used wereA - Plan 10 (cid:6) / 0 . 25 Ph1 and LD A - Plan 20 (cid:6) / 0 . 3 Ph1 ( both Zeiss ) . Manual tracking was applied to 3D and under - agarose chemotaxis assays . DCs were tracked over 3 to 4 hours with ImageJ ( National Institutes of Health [ NIH ] , Bethesda , MD ) and the Manual Tracking Plugin . Speed and directionality parameters were calculated and visualized as plots by analyzing the acquired data with the Chemotaxis and Migration Tool Plugin . To visualize the 3D morphology of DCs migrating toward CCL19 in a 3D collagen gel ( Figure 7A ) , DCs were labeled with 3 . 5 (cid:5) M TAMRA ( Invitrogen ) and imaged with an inverted Zeiss Observer . Z1 microscope equipped with a Yokogawa spinning disc confocal scanhead , Coolsnap HQ2 camera ( implemented by Visitron Systems , Pucheim , Germany ) and a Plan - APOCHROMAT 40 (cid:6) / 0 . 95 Korr oil objective ( Zeiss ) . Images were 3D reconstructed in MetaMorph and processed with the Surpass Tool of the Imaris 4 . 0 . 6 software ( Bitplane , Zu¨rich , Switzerland ) . Actin dynamics and total internal reﬂection microscopy DCs were transfected with lifeact : GFP between days 8 and 10 of culture using the primary mouse T - cell kit and the Amaxa nucleoporator ( Amaxa , Cologne , Germany ) . 30 Cells were transfected according to the manufactur - er’s recommendations , and immediately after transfection LPS was added for overnight maturation . The actin network of DCs migrating in an underagarose setting was visualized with an inverted Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope equipped with a total internal reﬂection setup , Coolsnap HQ2 camera ( both Visitron Systems ) and a Plan - FLUAR 100 (cid:6) / 1 . 45 oil objec - tive ( Zeiss ) . Images were taken every 2 seconds . Image analysis was performed with MetaMorph : protrusion and retraction of leading edge regions were presented as time montage after applying the background ﬂattening tool . Actin dynamics were quantiﬁed by kymograph analysis , whereby the actin polymerization rate was calculated as the sum of the retrograde actin ﬂow ( as observed in some DCs ) and the actin forward protrusion at the leading edge . Statistics After data were conﬁrmed to fulﬁll the criteria , t tests were performed ; otherwise , Mann - Whitney U tests were applied . Analyses were performed with Sigma Stat 2 . 03 ( Systat , San Jose , CA ) .

Results DC differentiation and maturation do not require Cdc42 We conditionally deleted Cdc42 in hematopoietic precursor cells by crossing mice carrying the conditional alleles with transgenics for the inducible Mx1 promoter – driven Cre recombinase . 26 , 27 We generated mature DCs in vitro from BM suspension of mice with induced knockout and obtained cells that were entirely negative for Cdc42 protein as tested by Western blotting ( Figure 1A ) . The cells showed normal DC surface markers including high MHCII and costimulatory molecules and also normal expression levels of chemokine receptor CCR7 ( Figure 1B ) . Cdc42 - deﬁcient ( Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) ) DCs had the typical veiled morphology , but were slightly smaller than WT DCs as revealed by the altered scatter proﬁle in ﬂow cytometry ( Figure 1B ) . These ﬁndings show that Cdc42 deﬁciency does not prevent myelopoiesis and DC generation and maturation in vitro . Apart from their smaller size , immature Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) DCs were severely impaired in the uptake of ﬂuorescent dextran and also bacterial particles ( data not shown ) , which is in agreement with previous reports that dominant - negative inhibition of Cdc42 function led to decreased endocytosis and phagocytosis . 22 , 31 Symmetry - breaking in response to homogenous chemokine exposure To observe the cells upon exposure to polarizing stimuli , we established an assay system that allowed us to follow the morpho - logic response of DCs by time - lapse video microscopy . As mature DCs are nonadherent , 6 we chose a setup where the cells are squeezed between a layer of agarose and a coverslip 29 ( Figure 2A ) . The spatial constraint in this semi - 3D setting caused ﬂattening of the cells , leading to a “2D projection” that ideally suits to assess Figure 1 .

ACTIN COORDINATION IN 3D DENDRITIC CELLMIGRATION 5705 BLOOD , 4 JUNE 2009 (cid:1) VOLUME 113 , NUMBER 23 For personal use only . on April 15 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From morphologic changes . When WT DCs were exposed to uniform concentrations of the CCR7 - binding chemokine CCL19 ( Figure 2B ; Video S1 ) , they underwent radial symmetrical expansion until after 2 to 3 minutes the disc shape was reached . This expansion was followed by sudden collapse of radial symmetry and segregation into a leading and a trailing edge , which was accompanied by locomotion . Although some WT cells developed multiple leading edges , the majority polarized along one randomly oriented axis . In Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) DCs , expansion and symmetry breaking occurred equally , demonstrating that CCR7 signaling was intact and that polarization as such was not impaired . However , leading and trailing edge were rarely aligned along one axis . Instead , many cells developed multiple competing leading edges ( Figure 2B ; Video S1 ) . These observations were in line with previous work demonstrating that Cdc42 regulates temporal and spatial stability of actin protrusions by either reinforcing one existing protrusion or suppressing the development of new protrusions . 32 This phenotype motivated us to use Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) DCs as a model system to study the role of actin ﬂow polarization during locomotion . Locally intact , but globally dysregulated , actin ﬂow in Cdc42 (cid:1) / (cid:1) DCs Cdc42 is an upstream activator of Rac activity and was further shown to negatively affect RhoAactivation in a neutrophil - like cell line . 16 Both effects might affect the protrusive and contractile aspects of the actin cytoskeleton . To characterize actin dynamics in Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) DCs , we transfected the cells with lifeact : GFP , a recently described actin - binding peptide , that leaves actin dynamics unaf - fected and allows dynamic visualization of actin ﬂow within the cells 30 ( Figure 2C , D ; Video S2 ) . As an optical setup to image the cortical actin ﬂow , we observed the transfected DCs under agarose with total internal reﬂection ( TIRF ) microscopy that excites exclusively the membrane - proximate 100 to 200 nm of the cell and allows high spatial and temporal resolution while phototoxic effects are minimized . In these assays , polarized WT DCs showed a continuous and expanding sheet of F - actin at the leading edge ( Figure 2C ) , whereas retrograde ﬂow was observed at the lateral aspects of the leading edge ( data not shown ) . In line with our bright - ﬁeld observations , the morphology of the actin cytoskeleton of Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) DCs was altered , as many cells developed 2 and sometimes multiple competing leading edges ( Figure 2D ) . Despite this global shape change , local actin ﬂow at the leading edge did not signiﬁcantly differ from WT cells : kymograph analysis showed that , on short timescale , polymerization rate and accordingly protrusion velocity were unaltered in the absence of Cdc42 ( t test , P (cid:7) . 069 ; Figure 2E ) . As the persistence time of each protrusion was decreased , protrusion was frequently followed by phases of contraction and retrograde ﬂow ( data not shown ) . These ﬁndings show that locally actin protrusion and contraction can be initialized in the absence of Cdc42 , meaning that a principal failure in Rac and RhoA activation is unlikely . It rather occurs that spatial and temporal coordination of actin dynamics is disturbed , leading to multiple competing , instead of one unifying , protrusions . Chemotactic movement in Cdc42 (cid:1) / (cid:1) DCs is moderately impaired in 2D We next wanted to test whether this failure to coordinate protru - sions affects chemotactic movement . A graded distribution of chemoattractant might preferentially trigger protrusion develop - ment toward the high concentration of attractant and , therefore , ( partially ) counteract the development of competing protrusions that we observed during spontaneous polarization . 33 We exposed WT cells in the under - agarose assays to diffusion gradients of CCL19 ( Figure 3A ; Video S3 ) , and observed direction - ally persistent chemotactic movement toward the chemokine source with single - cell velocities ranging between 5 and 15 (cid:5) m / minutes and high directional persistence ( Figure 3B - D ) . In Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) DCs , median velocities were only moderately reduced ( U test , P (cid:8) . 001 ) and cells still reached 80 % of the WT values ( Figure 3C ) . Although Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) DCs still showed net movement toward the chemokine , directionality values dropped to 59 % of the WT cells ( t test , P (cid:8) . 001 ; Figure 3B , D ) . To test whether the decreased directionality was a consequence of impaired coordination of protrusions , we tracked the morphology of the chemotaxing DCs . To exemplify shape changes , we traced the outlines of single cells and displayed cellular morphology alongside instantaneous migra - tion velocities ( Figure 3E ) . Although chemotaxing WT DCs underwent constant shape change , the development of multiple Figure2 . Actinpolymerizationandcoordinationattheleadingedgeofdendritic cells .

Whenever protrusions branched , retraction of the deviating protrusion occurred almost instanta - neously , leading to no signiﬁcant deceleration of the cell . In addition , Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) DCs showed phases of high velocities during which they resembled WT cells ( Figure 3E , gray - shaded track phases ) . These phases were frequently interrupted by episodes where the cells displayed multiple competing leading edges , which caused either spinning behavior or complete migratory arrest . Occasion - ally , multipolar cells even underwent self - fragmentation when multiple protrusions migrated in different directions ( data not shown ) . Taken together , the graded distribution of chemokine could not compensate for the coordination defect of Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) DCs , and the ability of chemotaxing cells to unify the actin ﬂow in one protrusion was impaired . Importantly , this defect led only to slightly diminished migration velocities . Chemotactic migration was still possible in the vertically conﬁned , but horizontally open , 2D setting of the under - agarose assay , albeit directionality was decreased due to the development of competing leading edges . In vivo migration of Cdc42 (cid:1) / (cid:1) DCs is completely abolished Having deﬁned the coordination defect of Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) DCs in vitro , we wanted to test how the phenotype manifests in vivo . Bone marrow – derived DCs are well suited for this purpose , as injection into the dermis of mice results in in vivo migration toward the draining lymph node . In an internally controlled experiment , we injected Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) DCs together with differentially labeled WT DCs into the footpads of mice and monitored their arrival in draining lymph nodes ( Figure 4A ) . Strikingly , arrival in the T - cell area was completely abolished in the Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) cells , and we could not detect even trace amounts of these cells either in the sinus area or in the T - cell cortex of the lymph node ( Figure 4B , C ) . This drastic phenotype was somewhat in contrast with our under - agarose assay and raised the question at which level migration was blocked . This could be movement in the dermal interstitium , entry into the lymphatic vessels , or transport toward the node . To distinguish between a possible block of interstitial migration and impaired entry into the lymphatic vessels , we directly observed the DCs upon entry into the dermal compartment . To this end we used “crawl - in” assays where labeled BM - derived DCs were layered on exposed dermis of explanted murine ear sheets ( Figure 5A ) .

ACTIN COORDINATION IN 3D DENDRITIC CELLMIGRATION 5707 BLOOD , 4 JUNE 2009 (cid:1) VOLUME 113 , NUMBER 23 For personal use only . on April 15 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From narrow down the anatomic site where migration was blocked , we recorded confocal z - stacks of the dermis . In an internally controlled experiment , we found that Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) DCs remained on the surface of the tissue , whereas WT cells deeply penetrated the dermis where the lymphatic vessels are buried ( Figure 5D ) . These data demon - strate the complete incapability of Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) DCs to inﬁltrate the interstitial meshwork despite their principal ability to perform chemotactic movement . Conﬁguration , not molecular composition , of the environment leads to abrogated migration Our previous data made it unlikely that the incapability to inﬁltrate the dermal interstitium was caused by a defect in chemokine sensing . Furthermore , the ﬁnding that DCs can migrate in the absence of adhesive interactions with the tissue 7 argued against Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) DCs being unresponsive to other cues of the dermal interstitium , such as extracellular matrix molecules . Hence , we explored the option that not the composition but the geometry of the environment could prevent entry of Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) DCs . To simulate a complex ﬁbrillar scaffold in the absence of the diverse dermal interstitial matrix molecules , we used 3D collagen gels as migration substrates . We showed previously that collagen gels are excellent substrates for chemotactic DC movement and that , like in vivo , the migration in these assays is independent of adhesion receptors . 7 We modiﬁed the previously described colla - gen gel chemotaxis assay to test for the invasive potential of DCs and layered WT and Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) DCs on top of collagen gels that contained CCL19 ( Figure 6A ) . Wild - type cells quickly invaded the gels , whereas Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) DCs strictly remained on top of the gel and invasion was virtually abolished ( t test , P (cid:8) . 001 ; Figure 6B , C ) . This indicated that the sheer conﬁguration of the extracellular environment rendered the mutant cells unable to enter . We next “forced” the cells into the gels by incorporation into the collagen scaffold before exposure to a CCL19 gradient ( Figure 6D ; Video S5 ) . In line with the invasion assays , WT cells vigorously Figure 5 . Analysis of ex vivo dendritic cell migration in a dermal ear explant .

When we visualized the cells in high resolution within the gels , it became apparent that in the absence of Cdc42 the ability to move long distances was completely abolished as the cells simultaneously sent protrusions in all directions ( Figure 7A ; Video S6 ) . Such behavior naturally leads to an entanglement of the cell in the dense meshwork . Accordingly , median migration velocities of Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) DCs in collagen gels dropped to 44 % compared with WT DCs ( U test , P (cid:8) . 001 ) and directional persistence was reduced to 25 % ( t test , P (cid:8) . 001 ; Figure 6F ) . Taken together , our 3D in vitro results completely resemble the severe in vivo migration defect and demonstrate that a loss of Cdc42 - mediated coordination of protrusive actin ﬂow leads to DC trapping in ﬁbrillar networks . We interpret the data as the logical 3D extension of the moderate phenotype in the 2D context of the under - agarose assay , which permits unrestricted movement in the horizontal dimension as no physical barriers exist . Discussion Our previous ﬁndings showed that interstitial leukocyte migration is nonadhesive and driven mainly by shape changes of the cortical actin network and protrusive ﬂowing of the leading edge . 7 Hence , it appears especially essential to gain more knowledge how cytoskel - etal regulation affects locomotion in hematopoietic cells . We show here that depletion of Cdc42 in DCs results in a defect of global cytoskeletal coordination , whereas , locally , actin polymerization and actomyosin contraction remains intact . In cells migrating on 2D surfaces , this defect manifests as tumbling and 41 % reduction of directional persistence , although the cells still reach 80 % of the velocities of their WT counterparts . These ﬁndings are in line with previous in vitro 2D migration studies that show intact chemokinesis , but impaired chemotaxis in macrophages , 17 neutrophil granulocytes , 15 and T lymphocytes 34 expressing dominant - negative mutants of Cdc42 . The phenotype also resembles the phenotype of Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) ﬁbroblastoid cells , which show unimpaired migration speed during wound closure , while directionality is mildly affected . 35 Surprisingly , the mild manifestation of the phenotype we observed in the 2D assays is qualitatively different in vivo where migration is almost completely arrested . As DCs migrate in the absence of adhesive interactions , it is unlikely that the different phenotypes result from distinct migration substrates in the 2D in vitro assays versus the interstitium of the dermis . We rather think that it is entirely due to the spatial conﬁguration of the environ - ment . This conclusion is supported by our ﬁnding that we also observed arrested migration in 3D collagen gels , which mimic the geometry of the dermis but not its complex molecular composition . This raises the question why increasing geometric complexity of the environment demands more tightly coordinated cytoskeletal protrusions . DCs and most other quickly migrating leukocytes do not use path - generating mechanisms such as pericellular proteoly - sis during migration in 3D environments . 36 They rather move along the path of least resistance and—if at all—they transiently deform their environment by squeezing contractions of the cell rear . 7 Hence , for a leukocyte , the interstitial environment can be de - scribed as a complex array of ﬁxed pores ( scheme , Figure 7B ) . The migratory process is a series of decisions to traverse the “most - promising” pore , which mechanistically means to funnel all actin ﬂow into one cellular protrusion . In this scenario , indecisiveness is extremely problematic , as multiple protrusions lead to entanglement . The geometric complexity of the interstitium compared with the unrestricted environment of the 2D assay explains why the decision problem of Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) DCs shows different manifestations in vivo and in vitro . In this study , we did not investigate in detail how Cdc42 regulates the decisive process of actin ﬂow coordination . However , there is a large body of literature involving Cdc42 in molecular feedback loops that promote the stable formation of one leading protrusion while competing protrusions are suppressed . 37 Interestingly , observations similar to our 2D ﬁndings were made in hemocytes of Drosophila embryos after blocking of Cdc42 activity by dominant - negative inhibition : when the chemotaxing cells were tracked in vivo , the inhibited cells reached velocities that were even higher than their WT counter - parts but the directional persistence was diminished . 19 Although these observations in the 3D environment of a living ﬂy embryo are contradictory with our 3D data at ﬁrst sight , they are explainable , as animals with an exoskeleton lack an interstitial matrix scaffold . 38 Like in the unrestricted 2D assays , entangle - ment in the nonﬁbrillar environment appears unlikely , as a cellular or viscous tissue probably allows deformation by the cytoskeletal forces of the hemocyte . So far , in vivo data on the effects of Cdc42 depletion in murine leukocytes are limited to a study showing that Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) hematopoi - etic stem cells are severely impaired in their BM homing and retention capacity . 18 By investigating DC migration in a physi - ologic context , we show here that tight regulation of polarized actin is decisive for leukocyte migration in the interstitium . Our ﬁndings underline the importance of considering the extracellular context when investigating cell migration—even in cells locomoting independent of the molecular composition of the tissue . We further think that the cellular polarity module might be a promising target Figure 7 . Morphology of migrating dendritic cells in 3D collagen gels and concluding scheme .
