We have biochemically identified the Sac - charomyces cerevisiae homologue of the mammalian actin binding protein cofilin . Cofilin and related pro - teins isolated from diverse organisms are low molecu - lar weight proteins ( 15 - 20 kD ) that possess several ac - tivities in vitro . All bind to monomeric actin and sever filaments , and some can stably associate with fila - ments . In this study , we demonstrate using viscosity , sedimentation , and actin assembly rate assays that yeast cofilin ( 16 kD ) possesses all of these properties . Clon - ing and sequencing of the S . cerevisiae cofilin gene ( COF1 ) revealed that yeast cofilin is 41 % identical in amino acid sequence to mammalian cofilin and , sur - prisingly , has homology to a protein outside the family of cofilin - like proteins . The NH2 - terminal 16 kD of Abplp , a 65 - kD yeast protein identified by its ability to bind to actin filaments , is 23 % identical to yeast cofilin . Immunofluorescence experiments showed that , like Abplp , cofilin is associated with the membrane actin cytoskeleton . A complete disruption of the COF1 gene was created in diploid cells . Sporulation and tetrad analysis revealed that yeast cofilin has an essen - tial function in vivo . Although Abplp shares sequence similarity with cofilin and has the same distribution as cofilin in the cell , multiple copies of the ABP1 gene cannot compensate for the loss of cofilin . Thus , cofilin and Abplp are structurally related but functionally dis - tinct components of the yeast membrane cytoskeleton . M USCLE contraction , cytokinesis , cell locomotion , and cytoplasmic streaming are among the numer - ous cellular processes that are mediated by the reg - ulated interactions between actin and actin binding proteins in eukaryotic cells . Most of the actin binding proteins that function in these various processes can be grouped into a small number of classes based on biochemical activities and / or structural similarities ( Stossel et al . , 1985 ; Pollard and Cooper , 1986 ; Hartwig and Kwiatkowski , 1991 ; Vandekerck - hove and Vancompernolle , 1992 ) . Although yeast cells ap - pear to exhibit a more modest variety of actin - based processes than more complex eukaryotes , representatives of most known classes of actin binding proteins have been identified in S . cerevisiae ( Barnes et al . , 1990 ) . Genetic anal - yses in yeast have demonstrated that the activities of these ac - tin binding proteins are important for proper actin function . Specifically , mutations in the genes that encode actin binding proteins ( Liu and Bretscher , 1989a ; Amatruda et al . , 1990 ; Haarer et al . , 1990 ; Adams et al . , 1991 ; Johnston et al . , 1991 ) often result in phenotypes similar to those of actin mu - tants ( Novick and Botstein , 1985 ) . It has been demonstrated that many of these yeast proteins , including capping protein , tropomyosin , profilin , and fimbrin , interact with actin in vi - tro much like their homologues from other organisms ( Liu and Bretscher , 1989b ; Haarer et al . , 1990 ; Adams et al . , 1991 ; Amatruda and Cooper , 1992 ) . Because organisms with Dr . Louie ' s present address is Applied Biosystems , Inc . , Foster City , CA 94404 . very different uses for actin contain a seemingly similar arse - nal of actin binding proteins , the wide variety of actin - based processes is likely to arise through the novel choreography of the activities of these ubiquitous proteins . It has not yet been possible to explain how the activities of actin binding proteins are collectively controlled and put to use to generate diverse biological phenomena . The opportunity to apply genetic analysis in S . cerevisiae to the study of protein function in the context of a living cell provides incentive to identify the full battery of actin regula - tory proteins from this organism . To date , members of the two families of actin filament severing proteins have not yet been identified in yeast . Both the gelsolin / villin / fragmin - type severing proteins and the smaller cofilin / destrin - type proteins appear to be widespread , having been found in ver - tebrates and simpler eukaryotes ( reviewed by Vandekerck - hove and Vancompernolle , 1992 ) . Both classes of proteins possess activities in addition to filament severing . For exam - ple , members of the gelsolin family exhibit capping and sometimes nucleating and / or bundling activity ( reviewed in Hartwig and Kwiatkowski , 1991 ) . The small cofilin - type proteins are also multifunctional in vitro , displaying mono - mer binding and sometimes filament binding activities ( see Hartwig and Kwiatkowski , 1991 ) . Potential modes of regula - tion have been suggested by biochemical studies ; the gel - solin - type protein activities are Ca 2 ยง dependent , cofilin ac - tivity is affected by pH , and the activities of both types can be modulated by binding to phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bis - phosphate ( reviewed in Vandekerckhove , 1990 ) .

This is of interest because the yeast S . cerevisiae is a simple , nonmotile organism , and it was not possible to predict whether yeast actin function would re - quire the diverse repertoire of actin binding proteins charac - teristic of other cells . A protein that decreases the viscosity of an actin solution was purified to near - homogeneity and was shown to be the yeast homologue of the actin filament severing protein , cofilin . Yeast cofilin is a component of the cortical actin cytoskeleton , and the gene that encodes cofilin ( COFI ) is an essential gene . These results suggest that the es - sential role of cofilin involves regulation of actin assembly in the membrane cytoskeleton , a protein complex important for the polarized growth of yeast cells . Materials and Methods Plasmid and Strain Construction All DNA manipulations were performed by standard techniques ( Maniatis et al . , 1982 ) . Restriction endonucleases and other enzymes were obtained from either New England Biolabs ~ verly , MA ) or Boehringer Mannheim Corp . ( Indianapolis , IN ) , except for Taq DNA polymerase , which was ob - tained from Perkin - Elmer / Cetus ( Norwalk , CT ) and Sequenase ( modified T7 DNA polymerase ) , which was obtained from United States Biochemical Corp . ( Cleveland , OH ) . The yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table I . Media were pre - pared , and standard genetic techniques of crossing , sporulation , and tetrad analysis were performed as described in Rose et al . ( 1990 ) . Two coil disrup - tion mutants were constructed . An internal fragment of the COF1 gene was used to create the partial disruption of COF1 ( cofl - l : : URA3 ) , which consists of two incomplete copies of COF1 , one encoding a protein missing the COOH - terminal 19 amino acids ( the 19 terminal codons are replaced with a singe stop codon ) , and the other copy missing the upstream regulatory sequences and the first 46 codons . This was done by linearizing a pRS306 - based vector ( Sikorski and Hieter , 1989 ) containing a 2 ? 0 - bp polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) 1 product of the COF / germ ( region from nncleotides 655 to 888 delineated by PCR primers ALM2 and ALM4 in Fig . 5 ) by cut - ring with BglII , which recognizes a unique site within the 270 - bp fragment ( at residue 802 ) ( see Fig . 5 ) . DDY288 was transformed with this DNA by LiAc transformation ( Ito et al . , 1983 ) as modified by Schiestl and Gietz ( 1989 ) , and heterozygous disruptants ( DDY425 ) were recovered based on their Ura + phenotype and confirmed by Southern hybridization . The com - plete disruption of COFI ( eofl - & l : : HlS3 ) was created by transforming DDY426 with a 2 . 8 - kb linear fragment composed of a 345 - bp EcoRI - BglII fragment containing the first two codons of COFI and upstream regions , a 2 - kb fragment containing the HIS3 germ , and a 469 - bp MnlI - SphI fragment containing the last eight codons of COF1 and downstream sequence ( see Fig . 5 ) . Purification of Yeast Cofilin Yeast lysates were prepared from bricks of commercial Red Star baker ' s yeast ( Universal Foods Corp . , Oakland , CA ) as previously described ( Drubin et al . , 1988 ) . For cell lysis , each brick ( , ' ~ g of wet ceils ) was suspended in 450 ml lysis buffer ( 5 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 5 , 1 mM EDTA , 20 mM KCI , 0 . 1 % NP - 40 ) before disrupting the cells . To minimize proteolysis , celt lysis and all subsequent chromatography steps were performed at 4aC and in the presence of protease inhibitors , all obtained from Sigma Chemi - cal Co . ( St . Louis , MO ) . Lysis buffer contained a 10 - 2 dilution of ethanol protease inhibitor cocktail ( 100x = ethanol solution containing 0 . 1 M PMSF and 0 . 1 mg / ml phenanthrolirm ) and a 10 - 3 dilution of aqueous pro - 1 . Abbreviations usedin thispaper : F - actin , filamentous actin ; G - actin , glob - ular actin ( monomeric actin ) ; HSS , high speed supernatant ; PCR , poly - merase chain reaction . tease inhibitor cocktail ( 1 , 000x = 0 . 5 mg / ml ofantipain , leupeptin , pepsta - tin A , chymostatin , and aprotinin ) . Column buffers contained only the aqueous protease inhibitors . After a 16 , 000 g clearing spin , the lysate was centrifuged at 135 , 000 g for 120 min , yielding a high speed supernatant ( HSS ) , our starting material . All column resins were obtained from Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology Inc . ( Piscataway , NJ ) . HSS was loaded on a 2 . 5 (cid:141) IZS - cm ( 85 ml ) Q - Sepharose column equilibrated in lysis buffer . The column was washed with 8 column volumes of column buffer ( 10 mM Tris . HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 5 mM EGTA , 20 mM KC1 , 1 mM DTT ) and eluted with a linear gradient of KC1 ( from 20 to 350 mM over 7 . 5 column volumes ) . The fractions containing a viscosity - decreasing activity that eluted from the column in 50 - 150 mM KC1 were pooled . The proteins that precipitated between 35 and 85 % satu - ration of ammonium sulfate were dissolved in a minimum volume of column buffer and dialyzed against two changes of column buffer . The ammonium sulfate precipitation step was used primarily to concentrate the protein for chromatography on a 2 . 6 x 100 - cm ( 530 ml ) ( Sephacryl S - 100 gel filtration column . Three viscosity - decreasing activities were separated on this column . The first peak of activity eluted from 200 to 220 ml , the second from 230 to 250 ml , and the third from 260 to 290 ml . The fractions that con - tained the third peak of activity were pooled and contained a major protein with an apparent molecular mass of 18 kD . Additional purification was achieved by using fast protein liquid chromatography grade columns : a 5 (cid:141) 50 - mm ( 1 ml ) Mono Q column and a 1 x 30 - cm ( 24 ml ) Superose 12 HR gel filtration column run using the Pharmacia fast protein liquid chro - matograph ) ' Chromatography Control System ( Pharmacia LKB Biotechnol - ogy Inc . ) . Gel filtration was performed in column buffer , the Mono Q column was loaded in column buffer and eluted with a linear gradient of KC1 from 20 to 350 mM . We estimate that by the final step ( Mono Q with column buffer containing 10 mM Tris . HC1 , pH 8 . 0 ) , the 16 - kD cofilin pro - tein constitutes > 94 % of the protein as estimated by visual comparison with dilutions of Coomassie blue - stained standards . Rabbit Muscle Actin Preparation Acetone povcter was prepared from rabbit muscle as previously described by Pardee and Spudich ( 1982 ) . Actin was extracted , clarified , and polymer - ized , and tropomyosin was removed as described , but with a slightly modified buffer A ( 5 mM Tris 8 . 0 , 0 . 2 mM CaCl2 , 0 . 2 mM ATE 0 . 2 mM DTT , 0 . 02 % Na azide ) . Filamentous actin ( F - actin ) was retrieved by cen - trifugation and dialyzed against three changes of buffer A over 2 d . F - actin was removed by centrifugation and aliquots of monomeric actin ( globular , or G - actin ) were quick - frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at - 80 ~ Falling Ball Viscometry Assay Falling ball viscometry ( Pollard , 1982 ) was applied as the primary assay to screen fractionated proteins for actin binding protein activity . Our ap - paratus consisted of a 100 - / A capillary tube ( Fisher Scientific Co . , Pitts - burgh , PA ) , a 12 ~ ramp , and a 0 . 025 - in . - diam stainless steel ball bearing ( ABEK Inc . , Bristol , CT ) . Rabbit muscle actin was used at a concentration of 4 - 6 # M . 10 # I of protein fraction , diluted protein fraction , or column buffer was added to the actin before initiation of polymerization . Actin was allowed to polymerize within the capillary tube for ~ 1 h at 23 ~ before vis - cosity measurements were taken . Pyrene - labeled Actin Assembly Pyrene - labeled actin was prepared by modifying the methods of Kouyama and Mihashi ( 1981 ) . Briefly , 100 mg of polymerized actin was pelleted and homogenized in buffer P ( 10 mM Hopes , 7 . 4 , 2 mM MgC12 , 100 mM KC1 , 0 . 5 mM ATP ) . 5 . 6 mg of N - ( 1 - pyrenyl ) iodoacetamide ( Molecular Probes , Inc . , Eugene , OR ) , previously dissolved in dimethyl formamide at a con - centration of 14 mg / ml , was added with agitation . The solution was in - cubated at 4 ~ in the dark overnight . The labeled actin was dialyzed against three changes of buffer A for 24 h , and then F - actin and precipitated N - ( 1 - pyrenyl ) iodoacetamide were removed by centrifugation at 100 , 000 g for 2 h . Aliquots of pyrene - labeled G - actin were quick - frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at - 80 ~ For assembly experiments , actin was used at a concentration of 5 # M . Pyrene - labeted actin constituted 5 - 20 % of total actin . Because some poly - merization of actin occurs during the freezing of aliquots , thawed actin was spun at 312 , 000 g ( 90 , 000 rpm ; TLA100 rotor ; Beckman Instruments , Carlsbad , CA ) for 40 rain before assembly initiation to remove F - actin . Be - fore initiation of polymerization , actin was stored in buffer A .

Fluores - cence measurements were taken continuously over time using a Hitachi F - 4010 fluorometer ( Hitachi Scientific Instruments , Mountain View , CA ) with a neutral density filter to minimize bleaching . Excitation wavelength was 355 nm and emission wavelength was 407 nm . Pelleting Assay Actin filament pelleting experiments were always done in parallel with the pyrene - labeled actin assembly experiments . Therefore , conditions are iden - tical to those described above , with the pelleting experiments also contain - ing pyrene - labeled actin . Polymerization proceeded for 2 h at 23 ~ The filaments were then pelleted by centrifugation at 90 , 000 rpm in a TLA100 rotor ( Beckman Instruments ) ( k = 8 . 9 , 312 , 000 g ) for 40 min at 23 " C . For visualization on Coomassie blue - stained SDS - PAGE gels , it was necessary to TCA precipitate the proteins in the supernatant ( Drubin et al . , 1988 ) . Samples were run on polyacrylamide gels , Coomassie stained , and ana - lyzed using a Bio - Rad 620 video densitometer ( Bio - Rad Laboratories , Richmond , CA ) . G - actin Binding A 1 x 30 - cm Superose 12 HR gel filtration column ( Pharmacia LKB Bio - technology Inc . ) was equilibrated in buffer A ( a buffer favoring depolymer - ization ; see above ) , and cofilin or cofilin with approximately fivefold molar excess of actin was loaded on the column . Elution of cofilin alone peaks from 10 to 11 ml . If actin is present , the peak of cofilin elution is between 8 and 9 ml . Antibodies Antibodies against yeast cofilin were raised in three virgin female New Zealand white rabbits . The most pure preparations of cofilin were further purified by excision of Coomassie blue - stained bands from SDS - PAGE gels as described ( Drubin et al . , 1988 ) . 50 ttg of protein was used for each injection . Freund ' s complete adjuvant was used for the first immunization , and Freund ' s incomplete adjuvant was used for the following injections ( days 21 and 36 ) . Sera collected on day 48 showed reactivity toward purified cofilin by immunoblotting , but was not of high enough titer to recognize the protein in a whole cell extract . An additional boost on day 78 raised the titer of sera collected on day 89 to a useful level . The antisera from two rabbits were affinity - purified using affinity columns prepared by coupling SDS - PAGE gel - purified yeast cofilin to CNBr - activated Sepharose ( Phar - macia LKB Biotechnology Inc . ) as previously described ( Pfeffer et al . , 1983 ) . The affinity - purified antibodies from one rabbit ( 9515 ) recognized only one protein with an apparent molecular mass of 18 kD in immunoblots of whole cell extracts . Those from a second rabbit ( 9516 ) recognized the same 18 - kD protein , but also a 50 - kD protein . For immunofluorescence , affinity - purified antibodies from rabbit 9515 were used exclusively . Immunofluorescence Yeast cells were grown to early log phase in either YPD or supplemented synthetic media and were processed for immunofluorescence as previously described ( Pringle et al . , 1991 ) . The cold methanol / acetone fixation step ( Pringle et al . , 1991 ) was required for both anti - actin and anti - cofilin reac - tivity . Affinity - purified anti - cofilin antibodies from rabbit 9515 were used at a dilution of 1 : 100 . Affinity - purified rat anti - actin antibodies ( kindly provided by J . Kilmartin , Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecu - lar Biology , Cambridge , England ) were used at a dilution of 1 : 30 . Detection was accomplished by applying fluorescein - labeled goat anti - rabbit and rhodamine - labeled goat anti - rat secondary antibodies ( Cappel / Organon Teknika , Malvern , PA ) at a dilution of 1 : 1 , 000 . The secondary antibodies are species specific , as no staining was seen when rabbit primary antibodies were used with anti - rat secondary antibodies , or when rat primary antibod - ies were used with anti - rabbit secondary antibodies . Cells were viewed a ~ d photographed with a Zeiss Axioscope fluorescence microscope with a HB100 W / Z high pressure mercury lamp and a Zeiss 100X Plan - Neofluar oil immersion objective ( Carl Zeiss , Thornwood , NY ) . Peptide Sequencing and PCR Primer Design Purified cofilin was subjected to proteolysis with endoproteinase Lys - C ( Boehringer Mannheim Corp . ) using an enzyme / substrate ratio of 1 : 50 for 2 h at 37 ~ in 50 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 . The resulting peptides were purified by HPLC chromatography using a Synchrom 2 . 1 x 10 - cm C - 18 column ( Ralnin Instrument Co . , Woburn , MA ) with 0 . 1 % trifluoroacetic acid , Moon et ai . Cofilin Is Essential for Yeast Viability 423 on A p r il 20 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published January 15 , 1993 0 - 60 % acetonitrile linear gradient . Three of the peptides ( LysC # 1 , LysC # 6 , and LysC # 7 ) were then amino terminal sequenced in a 470A gas phase se - quencer ( Applied Biosystems , Inc . , Foster City , CA ) , and the amino acids were analyzed by a 120A on - line PTH analyzer ( Applied Biosystems , Inc . ) . In one letter amino acid code , with uncertain residues in parenthesis , and with X representing unidentifiable residues , the sequences determined for the three peptides are as follows : LysC # 1 = ETST ~ LEK , LysC # 6 ffi IVFFTWSPDTAPVR ( E ) K , LysC # ' / - - DALRRALNGVSTD ~ dOGTDF - SEVSYX ( D ) VLERVS ( R ) GAG . Underlined sequences were used to design degenerate PCR primers ( see below ) . Since Lys - C cuts after lysine residues , and since LysC # 7 did not end in lysine , that peptide was assumed to be from the COOH terminus of cnfilin . Therefore , sequences from LysC # 7 were used to design the downstream PCR primer , ALM4 ( 5 ' CGGTCTAGACTARAARTCNGTNCCYTGNAC - RTC3 ' ) . The underlined sequence in Lys - - - C - - ~ l was used to design upstream primers ALM2 ( 5 ' ~ TCCCTGAYCCNTCNTAYGAYGC3 ' ) and primer ALM3 ( 5 ' ~ TCCCTGAYCCNAGYTAYGAYGC3 ~ but the primers use different eodons for a serine residue . Sequences in LysC 6 were used to design an additional upstream primer , ALM1 ( 5 ' ~ TCC - ACAARATHGTNTTYTTYACNTCK339 . Single underlined sequences rep - resent XbaI and BamI - II restriction endonuelease recognition sites and GC extensions included to facilitate cloning , and do not correspond to amino acids in the cofilin sequence . The double underlined sequence is a stop codon placed after the last amino acid enended by the downstream primer . We did not bias our primer design by any eodon usage criteria ; the down - stream primer was 1 , 024 - fold degenerate and the upstream primers ranged from 64 - to 384 - fold degenerate ( degeneracy created during synthesis by incorporating equimolar amounts of the following nueleotides at the posi - tions indicated by : R = A , G ; Y - - C , T ; H ffi A , C , T ; N = A , G , C , T ) . These oligonucleotides were used to prime DNA synthesis on total yeast genomic DNA ( $ 288C yeast strain background ) following standard PCR protocols ( Innis et al . , 1990 ) using a DNA thermal cycler ( Perkin - Elmer / Cetus ) . 270 - bp ( ALM2 - ALM4 ) and 157 - bp ( ALM1 - ALM4 ) PCR products were isolated from agarose gels and cloned using the restriction endonuclease sites designed into the primers . Sequencing of both products confirmed that each corresponds to a region of the gene that encodes cofilin . Since the 157 - bp product is contained within the 270 - bp product , only the latter product was used for further work . DNA Sequence Analysis Exol / I nuclease digestion was used to create deletion series for sequencing . Both strands of the COH gene were sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide termination method using single - stranded DNA templates ( Ausubel et al . , 1989 ) . Potential open reading frames and amino acid sequences were identified using the DNA Strider program ( Commissariat a l ' Energie Atom - ique , Gif - Sur - Yvette , France ) , while the position of the predicted intron was detected by visual analysis . Related proteins were identified by Hypereard Blastp ( Apple Computer , Cupertino , CA ) searches , but final alignments were done by visual inspection . Results Purification of a Yeast Actin Filament Severing Protein A solution of actin filaments possesses a viscosity that de - pends on the concentration , length , and crosslinking of the filaments . Actin binding proteins can alter these variables to create a more or less viscous solution or to form a more elas - tic gel . Falling ball viscometry ( Pollard , 1982 ) has been suc - cessfully applied in the past to identify gelation proteins , capping protein , and a severing / monomer binding protein from Acanthamoeba ( Isenberg et ai . , 1980 ; MacLean - Fletcher and Pollard , 1980 ; Cooper et ai . , 1986 ) . We ap - plied this assay to screen fractionated yeast proteins for ac - tivities that alter the low shear viscosity of actin solutions . Soluble yeast proteins were loaded on an anion exchange column ( Q - Sepharose ) and the flow - through from this column was loaded on a cation exchange column ( S - Sepha - rose ) . Proteins were eluted using gradients of increasing salt concentration . Elution profiles of actin - interaeting activities as detected by the falling ball assay are shown in Fig . 1 . The time that it takes for the ball to fall through the solution ( fall - ing bail time in Fig . 1 , a and b ) is related to the viscosity of the solution ( Pollard , 1982 ) . The dotted line shows the vis - cosity of actin alone ; a decrease in viscosity occurs as the salt concentration in the column buffer is increased . When the proteins that elute from the Q - Sepharose column in 50 - 170 mM KCI are added to an actin assembly reaction , a decrease in viscosity is observed ( Fig . 1 a ) . Under the condi - tions used in this study , 6 s corresponds to the maximum fall - ing bail rate , as a solution of G - actin gives similar falling bail times . Because 6 s is the falling bail time measured in the peak shown in Fig . 1 a , dilutions of fractions in this region were performed to better quantitate the activities present in each fraction . Upon assaying the diluted fractions , the broad peak of activity separated into two peaks ( not shown ) . A hint of this separation is evident in Fig . 1 a . In addition to this viscosity - decreasing activity , a viscosity - increasing activity was eluted from the S - Sepharose column ( Fig . 1 b ) . From these experiments , it is apparent that there are several pro - teins present in yeast extracts that can be detected by their effects on actin viscosity . We report the purification and characterization of a protein that has a viscosity - decreasing activity and elutes from the Q - Sepharose column ( Fig . 1 a ) . This activity was selected for purification first because it cofractionates with an in - teresting additional activity ; these fractions also cause an in - crease in the rate of actin assembly ( see below ) . Subsequent purification revealed that a single protein with an apparent molecular mass of 18 kD was found to possess the dual prop - erties of accelerating actin assembly and decreasing actin viscosity ( Fig . 2 , Table II ) . The Coomassie blue - stained gel presented in Fig . 2 shows the enrichment of this protein dur - ing our purification procedure ( see Materials and Methods ) . Both the falling bail viscometry assay and an assembly ki - netics assay using pyrene - labeled actin ( Cooper et ai . , 1983 ) were used to follow the two activities during the purification of the 18 - kD protein ( Table II ) . No activity is apparent in our starting material , the high speed supernatant ; both activities appear only after the first fractionation step , the Q - Seph - arose column . The Q - Sepharose column fractions that con - tained the viscosity - decreasing / assembly rate - increasing ac - tivity were pooled , the proteins were concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation , and then the precipitated proteins were fractionated on a Sephacryl S - 100 gel filtration column . Three viscosity - decreasing activities were resolved on this column . For this study , only the fractions containing the third peak of activity that eluted from the column were pooled . The Sephacryl S - 100 fractionation step actually in - creased the total amount of assembly rate - increasing activ - ity ( Table II , column 4 ) , suggesting that an inhibitory activ - ity was removed . An 18 - kD protein was a major constituent after this step . During subsequent purification steps ( see Materials and Methods ) , the 18 - kD protein was enriched and the specific activity increased . The fact that the specific ac - tivity was still increasing during the final stages of our purification suggests that additional purification procedures could be used in the future to obtain even higher purity . However , neither cation exchange chromatography ( S - Seph - arose ) nor hydrophobic chromatography ( phenyl - Sepharose , octyl - Sepharose ) were helpful for further purification of p18 .

Pyrene - labeled actin was used in an assembly assay to monitor the effects of yeast cofilin on actin polymerization over time ( Cooper et al . , 1983 ) . Pyrene fluorescence in - creases when a pyrene - labeled actin subunit is incorporated into a filament ( Fig . 3 , STD ) . Yeast cofilin increases the rate of assembly ( Fig . 3 ) , but its effects are seen only in the late stage of actin polymerization , after the lag phase . This be - havior can be explained by invoking a severing activity ; when newly formed actin filaments are severed , new ends become available for subunit addition , which allows for more rapid actin assembly . The severing of actin filaments by Acanthamoeba actophorin has recently been confirmed by direct visual observation ( Maciver et al . , 1991 ) . All of the other cofilin - like proteins show very similar effects on actin assembly , including the characteristic drop in total fluorescence intensity at steady state as increasing amounts of cofilin are added , and the initial overshoot of this final level ( Mabuchi , 1983 ; Nishida et al . , 1984a , b ; Cooper et al . , 1986 ) . The drop in fluorescence intensity at steady state as the cofilin / actin ratio increases might represent the inhibition of actin polymerization by the monomer se - questering activity possessed by these proteins . However , the binding of proteins to pyrene - labeled actin subunits in a fila - ment might also affect the fluorescence signal ( Kouyama and Mihashi , 1981 ) . The reasons behind the overshoot have not yet been determined . The behavior of yeast cofilin in these assembly experiments , as well as its viscosity - lowering effect , which may result from the lowering of average filament length , suggest that the severing activity of cofilin - like pro - teins is conserved in most , if not all , eukaryotic cells . account for (cid:127)6 % of the total protein mass after the final step , as determined by comparison of staining of the con - taminants to dilutions of proteins of known concentrations . To estimate the concentration of the 18 - kD protein in the HSS , antibody reactivity on immunoblots of high speed su - pernatant was compared with reactivity toward known quan - tities of pure p18 . Based on this value , , , o5 % of the 18 - kD protein present in our starting material is recovered after our final purification step . Microsequencing of peptides derived from the 18 - kD pro - tein revealed that it contains sequences similar to those found in a class of low molecular weight actin severing and monomer binding proteins . Cloning and sequencing of the gene encoding p18 confirmed that it belongs to this family of cofilin - like proteins ( see below ) . This group includes the vertebrate cofilin ( Nishida et al . , 1984b ) and ADF / destrin - type proteins ( Bamburg et al . , 1980 ; Nishida et al . , 1984b ) , echinoderm depactin ( Mabuchi , 1983 ) , and Acanthamoeba actophorin ( Cooper et al . , 1986 ) . These proteins all sever actin filaments and bind to actin monomers . In addition , cofilin can bind to actin filaments with a 1 : 1 molar ratio ( Nishida et al . , 1984b ) , while the other members of the pro - tein family bind weakly ( Kofferet al . , 1988 ) or do not bind at all ( Cooper et al . , 1986 ) . The biochemical similarities of the yeast protein to mammalian cofilin ( see below ) led us to 1 : 32 10 . ~ s 5 1 ' 0 15 2 ( I ~ 3 ( ) 35 40 Time ( minutes ) Figure 3 . Yeast cofilin increases the rate of actin polymerization . A plot of fluorescence of pyrene - labeled actin over time is shown . Time is measured in minutes , with time 0 representing the point at which polymerization initiating salts are added . Fluorescence is in arbitrary units . STD is standard actin polymerization without coil - lin . Standard actin assembly reactions ( STD ) reached steady state after 120 min . At that point , the final level of fluorescence of the standard was equal to the level reached in the plot labeled 1 : 32 at 40 min . For the other reactions , actin is polymerized in the pres - ence of cofilin , with the relative amount of cofilin indicated as the molar ratio of cofilin / actin . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 120 , 1993 426 on A p r il 20 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published January 15 , 1993 Figure 4 . Copelleting of yeast cofilin with actin filaments . So - lutions of cofilin alone , actin alone , or cofilin plus actin were incubated for 2 h in polymeriza - tion buffer and centrifuged ( see Materials and Methods ) . ( a ) Cofilin binds stably to actin filaments . A Coomassie blue - stained SDS 13 % polyacryl - amide gel of proteins in the su - pernatants ( S ) or pellets ( P ) and of centrifuged samples is shown . Bracketed lanes contain equal molar amounts of supernatant and pellet from the same reac - tion . Lanes 1 and 2 are from a solution containing only cofilin . Lanes 3 and 4 are from a solu - tion containing equal amounts of cofilin and actin . Lanes 5 and 6 are from a solution containing only actin . ( b ) Cofilin increases the amount of nonsedimentable actin . Gels similar to the one shown in a were run and stained , and bands were quantitated by densitometry ( see Materials and Methods ) . Data from two independent trials are graphed here . Total actin in the reaction is 5 # M . The actin concentration ( micromolar ) in the supernatant is shown on the y - axis . Labels on the x - axis represent the relative amount of cofilin and actin in the reaction , expressed as a molar ratio ofcofilin / actin . STD has no cofilin . To determine whether yeast cofilin stably binds to actin filaments , actin and cofilin were incubated under assembly - inducing conditions , and the filaments were pelleted by cen - trifugation at 312 , 000 g for 40 min . Actin filaments > 10 subunits in length will pellet under these conditions ( Attri et al . , 1991 ) . While cofilin alone does not pellet ( Fig . 4 a , lanes 1 and 2 ) , it does copellet with actin filaments ( Fig . 4 a , lanes 3 and 4 ) . It is also apparent that cofilin affects the amount of actin that sediments . This can be seen by comparing lanes 3 and 5 in Fig . 4 a ; more actin remains in the supernatant when cofilin is present . Although most of the actin is still pelleted , the amount left unsedimented is increased by the addition of cofilin ( Fig . 4 b ) . Actin left in the supernatant might represent either sequestered monomers or very short filaments . When observations from the pelleting and assembly rate ( Fig . 3 ) experiments are compared , it becomes clear that the drop in fluorescence intensity of pyrene - actin at steady state caused by addition of cofilin cannot be accounted for com - pletely by monomer sequestration . Fluorescence intensity is decreased by > 40 % when 2 . 5 / ~ M of cofilin is added to the 5 / ~ M actin solution ( Fig . 3 , plot labeled 1 : 2 ) , suggesting that 2 / zM of the actin would be present in the supernatant if monomer sequestration was the sole cause . However , < 0 . 4 # M actin remains in the supernatant upon centrifugation ( Fig . 4 b ) . In these experiments , only a portion of the actin is pyrene labeled . If cofilin preferentially sequestered pyrene - labeled actin , the fluorescence intensity would be dramati - cally affected without much effect on the total amount of po - lymerization . This does not appear to be the case , since changing the percentage of pyrene - labeled actin from 5 to 20 % has no effect on the results ( data not shown ) . Alterna - tive causes for the decrease in fluorescence may be that bind - ing of cofilin to the filaments quenches the fluorescence sig - nal , or that pyrene - labeled actin subunits that are very near the ends of filaments fluoresce less than those incorporated away from an end ; therefore , distributing the same amount of polymerized actin in short filaments would cause a de - crease in fluorescence intensity . Although monomer sequestration does not account for the full magnitude of the characteristic drop in fluorescence that occurs when the cofilin - like proteins are added to F - actin ( Mabuchi , 1983 ; Nishida et al . , 1984b ; Cooper et al . , 1986 ) , it has been demonstrated that all of these proteins bind to G - actin . To further document the affinity of yeast cofilin for monomeric actin , gel filtration chromatography of cofilin alone or cofilin with a fivefold molar excess of G - actin was performed . In the presence of G - actin , the retention time of cofilin is decreased ( data not shown ) , adding further sup - port to the conclusion that , like the other proteins in this fam - ily , yeast cofilin has an affinity for monomeric actin . Molecular Cloning and Sequencing of COFI Degenerate PCR primers designed after the 18 - kD protein peptide sequences were used to amplify a 270 - bp fragment from yeast genomic DNA ( see Materials and Methods for peptide and primer sequences ) . The PCR product was se - quenced to confirm that it is part of the gene that encodes the 18 - kD protein . The cloned PCR fragment was then used to screen the YCp50 - based library RB239 ( Rose et al . , 1987 ) , and a plasmid containing the full - length COF1 gene was obtained . The nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences of the COFI gene and protein are shown in Fig . 5 . The hypothetical protein has a predicted molecular mass of 15 . 9 kD , similar to that determined for the purified protein ( 18 kD ) . The un - derlined amino acids match 63 of 66 residues determined by peptide sequencing . All three residues that differ ( double un - derlined ) were in regions where peptide sequencing was of low confidence ( unidentifiable or uncertain assignments ) . It is likely that the COF1 gene contains a 179 - bp intron . Moon et al .

These sequence data are avail - spnr able from EMBL under accession number 1381 ACGCTGTGCTGGCATGC Z14971 . This conclusion is supported by the presence of consensus TACTAAC and splice donor / acceptor sequences found in yeast introns ( Woolford , 1989 ) . Utilization of the splice junction predicted by these sequences would allow for the production of a protein whose NH ~ terminus is similar in sequence to other members of the family of cofilin - like pro - teins ( Fig . 6 ) . The NH2 - terminal methionine was assigned to the first ATG upstream of the predicted upstream splice site . A stop codon ( TAA ) is found in the same reading frame , four codons upstream of this ATG , with no intervening ATG sequences . Protein sequencing could not be used to confirm the sequence of this region because the NH : terminus of the protein was blocked . Therefore , until cDNA sequence is ob - tained to confirm the splice junction , we leave open the pos - sibility that an ATG within the predicted intron ( dotted un - derline ) may be used as the initiator codon . Use of this ATG would result in a protein that is 13 amino acids longer than that produced by a spliced mRNA ( MWGKKFIRSQENVKF - LCS . . . instead of MSRSG . . . ) . Based on the arguments of favorable nucleotide sequence context for splicing and of homology to proteins in the cofilin - like protein family , Fig . 5 presents the most likely sequence of yeast cofilin .

Yeast cofilin is a mem - ber of the family of low molecu - lar weight actin - severing pro - teins . The yeast cofilin protein ( top line ) is compared with other 91 members of the cofilin family as 1 o 7 indicated . Dashes represent 107 102 gaps introduced to optimize alignment . Black boxes repre - 143 sent identical residues , and grey 166 shading indicates similar resi - 16s dues ( A = S = T ; A = G ; I = L = 150 V = M ; K = R = H ; F = Y = W ; D = E ; Q = N ) . Numbers at fight indicate amino acid number . Previous studies with mammalian and starfish proteins have identified the overlined regions as potential actin - interacting regions based on crosslinking ( open bars ) or synthetic peptide studies ( solid bars ) . Murine coftlin ( Moriyama et al . , 1990a ) , porcine destrin ( Moriyama et al . , 1990b ) , and starfish depactin ( Takagi et al . , 1988 ) sequences were obtained from Genbank . ( starfish ) . Black shading shows residues that are identical to corresponding residues in yeast cofilin , and grey shading in - dicates conservative replacements . Overlined sequences cor - respond to regions implicated in actin binding by previous crosslinking ( open bars ) ( Sntoh and Mabuchi , 1989 ; Yonezawa et al . , 1991b ) and peptide binding experiments ( solid bars ) ( Yonezawa et al . , 1989 , 1991b ) ( see Discussion ) . Yeast cofilin is most similar to the mammalian cofilin protein , be - ing 41 % identical and 63 % similar in amino acid sequence . The corresponding values for destrin are 37 % / 59 % , and for depactin they are 22 % / 42 % . Yeast cofilin is somewhat smaller than the mammalian and starfish proteins . To com - pensate for this , two major gaps were introduced to optimize the alignments . Yeast Cofilin Is Similar to the NHz Terminus of Abplp Abplp is a 65 - kD yeast actin binding protein discovered by its ability to bind to actin filaments ( Drubin et al . , 1988 ) . It contains an SH3 domain ( src homology 3 ) at its COOH terminus ( Drubin et ai . , 1990 ) . This * 50 amino acid motif is found in many nonreceptor tyrosine kinases ; cytoskeletai proteins including Abplp , myosin I , and ct - spectrin ; and an - other yeast morphogenetic protein , Bemlp ( Koch et al . , 1991 ; Chenevert et al . , 1992 ) . The NH2 terminus of Abplp is homologous to yeast cofilin ( Fig . 7 ) . The proteins share 23 % identity and 41 % similarity over the entire 16 - kD re - gion , with the COOH - terminal portion of cofilin showing stronger homology to Abplp ( Fig . 7 b ) . Particularly strong homology is found in a region that corresponds to a potential actin binding region of mammalian cofilin ( overlined se - quence ) ( Yonezawa et al . , 1991b ) . This is the first identifica - tion of homology between cofilin and a protein outside of the immediate family of cofilin - like proteins .

COF1 - SPA2 distance was calculated using the formula [ 50 (cid:141) ( TT + 6NPD ) ] / total using data derived from crosses between Y602 x DDY428 ( 35 tetrads ) , Y609 x DDY429 ( 41 tetrads ) , Y602 x DDY480 ( 92 tetrads ) , and DDY481 x DDY131 ( 28 tetrads ) . Each of the crosses gave similar results . Centromere linkage was determined by using the LEU2 gene ( 5 cM away from CENIII ) and the TRP1 gene ( 0 . 8 cM away from CENIIO ( Mortimer et al . , 1989 ) . Distances from COF1 and SPA2 to the chromosome XII centromere were estimated using the formula [ ( 50 (cid:141) TT ) / total ] , less the distance of LEU2 ( 5 cM ) or of TRP1 ( 0 . 8 cM ) from their respective centromeres . Data for COF1 - CENXll and SPA2 - CENXII were derived from crosses between Y609 x DDY429 ( 41 tetrads ) , Y602 x DDY480 ( 92 tetrads ) , and DDY481 (cid:141) DDYI31 ( 28 tetrads ) . Additional data for COFI - CENXII were derived from the cross DDY182 x DDY428 ( 52 tetrads ) . The distances calculated above predict an ordering of CENXII - SPA2 - COF1 , and this was confirmed by analy - sis of data from the crosses Y602 x DDY480 and DDY481 (cid:141) DDYI31 , which create diptoids herterozygous for leu2 , trpl , COFI ( HISdg , and SPA2 ( URA3 ) . Our data place SPA2 12 cM away from CENXII , closer than the published distance of 21 cM ( Snyder , 1989 ) . that COF1 is on chromosome XII . When the filters of the or - dered yeast library ( Olson et al . , 1986 ) were probed , we found that COF1 is present on clone 4354 . This clone spans the region 34 - 43 kb from the left end of chromosome XII . Comparison of the COF1 restriction map to that of clone 4354 more precisely places COF1 in the region 35 . 5 - 40 kb from the end . Genetic mapping agrees with the gene order determined by physical mapping ; COF1 maps 7 cM away from SPA2 , which was previously known to be on the left arm of chromosome XII . SPA2 lies between the centromere and COF1 ( Table III ) . Indirect Immunolocalization of Cofilin to Actin Structures in the Cell Actin forms two types of structures in yeast cells : actin ca - bles that run through the cytoplasm , and actin patches that are located at the cell cortex at or near sites of cell surface growth ( Adams and Pringle , 1984 ) . Both the cortical actin and the actin in the cables are known to be F - actin structures because they stain with fluorochrome - conjugated derivatives of the mushroom toxin phalloidin , which binds only to F - actin . Since yeast cofilin binds to F - actin in vitro ( Fig . 4 ) , it was important to determine if this is also the case in vivo . Poly - clonal antisera against purified cofilin were raised in rabbits . When afffinity - purified against cofilin , the antibodies from rabbit 9515 recognized only one band of apparent molecular mass 18 kD on an immunoblot of whole cell extract ( Fig . 8 , lane 2 ) . When immunofluorescence with anti - cofilin anti - bodies was performed on fixed yeast cells , general cytoplas - mic staining and brightly staining " dots " located primarily in the bud or presumptive bud were seen ( Fig . 9 , b and d ) . DAPI staining ( data not shown ) indicates that the dark regions correspond to the nucleus , indicating nuclear exclu - sion ( see Discussion for significance ) . In cells double - labeled for actin , the cofilin dots colocalize with the cortical actin structures , but cofilin is not seen in association with the Figure 8 . Affinity - purified an - tibodies recognize a single protein species in yeast whole cell extracts . Lane 1 , Coomas - sic - stained gel of purified yeast cofilin ; lanes 2 and 3 , immu - noblot using affinity - purified antibodies from rabbit 9515 ; whole cell extract was loaded in each lane from the follow - ing strains : wild - type ( DDY - 288 ) ( 2 ) and diploid with one truncated copy of COH ( COF1 / cof 1 - 1 : : URA3 ) ( DDY425 ) ( 3 ) ; lane 4 , Immu - noblot of whole cell extract using antibodies to both Coflp and Abplp . Abplp runs on SDS - PAGE gels as an 85 - kD protein . actin cables found in the mother cell ( Fig . 9 ) . It is possible that the cytoplasmic staining might obscure a weak signal from the cytoplasmic actin cables . Interestingly , cofilin distribution is identical to that of Abplp ( Drubin et al . , 1988 , 1990 ) , with which it shares se - quence similarity ( Fig . 7 ) . Because of this similarity , it was important to demonstrate that the anti - cofilin antibodies do not recognize Abplp . Immunoblots reveal only one 18 - kD protein that reacts with anti - cofilin antibodies ( Fig . 8 , lane 2 ) . To confirm that high molecular weight proteins were transferred to the membrane , another lane was probed with both anti - cofilin and anti - Abplp antibodies ( Drubin et al . , 1988 ) ( Fig . 8 , lane 4 ) . In addition , when immunofluores - cence experiments were repeated on abpl null mutants ( DDY321 ) , anti - cofilin antibodies still recognized the corti - cal patches and cytoplasm . Abnormal actin structures arise in cells with altered cytoskeletal components . Thick actin " bars " form in act1 - 2 cells at the permissive temperature ( Novick and Botstein , 1985 ) . Similar structures form in profilin mutants ( Haarer et al . , 1990 ) , occasionally in tropomyosin mutants ( Liu and Bretscher , 1989a ) , and in cells that overexpress Abplp ( Drubin et al . , 1988 ) . Although cofilin could not be detected in association with wild - type actin cables , yeast cofilin is a component of the abnormal actin bars found in the actl - 2 mu - tant ( Fig . 10 ) . Double labeling with anti - actin antibodies confirms that the bars containing cofilin are actin bars ( data not shown ) . These bars are usually found near the nucleus , but do not appear to be intranuclear . The bars do not stain with phalloidin , indicating that they might not be composed of normal actin filaments . Abplp also associates with these aberrant actin structures , but not with wild - type cables ( Drubin et al . , 1988 ) . COF1 Is an Essential Gene To determine the effect of loss of cofilin function on the cell , two types of COF1 gene disruptions were created . One dis - ruption resulted in a truncation of the last 19 amino acids of The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 120 , 1993 430 on A p r il 20 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published January 15 , 1993 Figure 9 .

The disruptions were constructed by homologous recombination in diploid strains , and transformants were recovered based on Ura + or His + phenotypes . Three Ura + and five His + isolates were sporu - lated and tetrads were dissected . In every case but one , only two of four spores were viable ( Fig . 11 ) , and the two live spores never carried the marker for the disruptions . South - ern hybridizations confirmed that all strains contained one copy of cofl - l : : URA3 ( DDY425 ) or cofl - Al : : HIS3 ( DDY427 ) except for the single His + isolate , which yielded four viable spores . The spores that did not produce colonies were ana - lyzed by microscopy . The cofl - l : : URA3 spores sometimes Moon et al .

However , these cells sometimes formed projections , which might reflect attempts at budding . To further analyze the cofl - l : : URA3 truncation , in which a stop codon replaces the last 19 codons , extracts from het - erozygous diploid cells were prepared and analyzed by im - munoblotting with anti - cofilin antibodies . There is no higher mobility species of cofilin detected in these strains ( Fig . 8 , lane 3 ) . Therefore , either the truncation creates a protein that is rapidly degraded , or the last 19 amino acids of yeast cofilin possess all of the epitopes recognized by our polyclonal anti - bodies . The homology between cofilin and Abplp ( Fig . 7 ) , as well as their identical subcellular location , suggests that the two proteins might play similar roles in the cell . Although the single copy of ABP1 present in wild - type cells cannot com - pensate for the loss of cofilin ( Fig . 11 ) , we speculate that overproduction of Abplp might suppress cofl - Al lethality . The strain DDY427 , a diploid heterozygous for a COF1 dis - ruption , was transformed with pRB1201 , a multicopy vector containing a copy of the ABP1 gene ( Drubin et al . , 1988 ) . Sporulation and tetrad dissection gave results identical to those in Fig . 11 . Apparently , although Abplp contains se - quences similar to cofilin , the functions of the two proteins are not redundant . Discussion Although S . cerevisiae is a simple eukaryote , the yeast actin cytoskeleton requires many types of actin regulatory pro - teins to function efficiently . Motors , filament bundling , fila - ment stabilizing , monomer sequestering , and capping pro - teins have been identified , and each contributes to the proper functioning of actin in facilitating spatially directed cell growth . We wished to determine whether two other types of widely distributed actin binding proteins , the severing and gelation proteins , are utilized by yeast . The activities of these proteins are regarded as important for the cytoplasmic gel - sol transitions that are associated with cell locomotion . We provide the first evidence for the presence of both types of proteins in this nonmotile cell . There are at least three actin viscosity - decreasing activities in yeast extracts . The isola - tion and subsequent characterization of a cofilin - like protein as the agent of one of these activities confirms that yeast con - tain at least one severing protein . The other activities may The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 120 , 1993 432 on A p r il 20 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published January 15 , 1993 Figure 11 . COF1 is an essential gene .

There is also a viscosity - increasing activity that binds to and elutes from a cation exchange column . This suggests the presence of a protein that can crosslink filaments into actin networks . Therefore , our work expands the possible arsenal of yeast actin binding proteins to include severing and gelation proteins . The presence of most types of actin binding proteins in yeast shows that even apparently simple actin function requires sophisticated regu - lation by numerous actin binding proteins . Yeast cofilin is only 41 % identical to mammalian cofilin , but retains remarkably similar biochemical activities . Com - parison of the cofilin - like proteins from evolutionarily dis - tant organisms may help to identify residues that are re - quired for activity ( Fig . 6 ) . The regions corresponding to yeast cofilin residues 4 - 11 and 88 - 109 have the highest de - gree of similarity when the sequences of four proteins ( yeast cofilin , mammalian cofilin , mammalian destrin , and starfish depactin ) are compared . Biochemical studies also suggest that these two regions interact with actin . Residues of mam - malian cofilin located within the highly conserved region corresponding to yeast cofilin residues 88 - 109 can be cross - linked to actin ( Yonezawa et al . , 1991b ) . In addition , the dodecapeptide WAPECAPLKSKM designed after sequences in this region of porcine cofilin has actin - depolymerizing ac - tivity ( Yonezawa et al . , 1991b ) . Site - directed mutagenesis of mammalian cofilin and analysis in vitro showed that specific point mutations of residues in this region can cause a marked decrease in actin binding ability ( Moriyarna et al . , 1992 ) . It is noteworthy that this stretch of residues is not only highly conserved among the cofilin - like proteins , but also in Abplp ( Fig . 7 , overlined sequence ) . Another peptide , DAIKKKL , corresponding to a region of manunalian cofilin that follows the WAPECAPLKSKM sequence , also has actin binding ac - tivity ( Yonezawa et al . , 1989 ) . This sequence is not as well conserved in depactin or Abplp as it is in the cofilins and in destrin . The functional significance of these differences re - mains to be determined . Residues in the NH2 - terminal re - gion of depactin ( depactin residues 1 - 20 ) can also be cross - linked to actin ( Sutoh and Mabuchi , 1989 ) . Although no synthetic peptide or mutagenesis studies have yet been un - dertaken to further probe the interaction of this region with actin , the homology among the cofilin - like proteins ' NH2 termini indicates that this region might also be functionally important . The site - directed mutagenesis of residues in the NH2 terminal , WAPECAPLKSKM , and DAIKKKL regions of yeast cofilin followed by gene replacement will help to de - termine how important these conserved residues are for cofilin ' s essential function in vivo . In agreement with predictions based on its biochemical properties , cofilin was demonstrated by immunofluorescence to colocalize with F - actin structures in the cell . In addition , the possibility that cofilin might interact with G - actin in vivo is suggested by the cytoplasmic cofilin staining that is ob - served by immunofluorescence . This staining is absent from the nuclear region . Because a 16 - kD protein should be below the exclusion limit of the nuclear pore ( reviewed in Dingwall and Laskey , 1986 ) , cofilin might be excluded from the nu - cleus because it associates with both F - and G - actin in the cytoplasm . Yeast cofilin associates with cortical F - actin , but not with cytoplasmic actin cables ( Fig . 9 ) . Yeast tropomyo - sin has the opposite distribution , associating only with the cytoplasmic cables ( Liu and Bretscher , 1989a ) . It is perhaps relevant that mammalian tropomyosin and the mammalian cofilin - like proteins compete for binding to actin filaments in vitro ( Bernstein and Bamburg , 1982 ; Nishida et al . , 1984b , 1985 ) . Mammalian cofilin is distributed throughout the cytoplasm of mouse fibroblasts , is absent from stress fbers , and is con - centrated in F - actin - rich ruffling membranes ( Yonezawa et al . , 1987 ) . This localization is reminiscent of yeast cofilin distribution throughout the cytoplasm and in the cortical ac - tin structures , but not on the cytoplasmic cables . Moreover , when cultured fibroblasts are exposed to an isotonic NaC1 solution , stress fibers disappear and shorter actin rods form ( Iida and Yahara , 1986 ) . Like the bars formed in act1 - 2 mu - tants , these rods do not stain with phalloidin , but are recog - nized by anti - cofilin antibodies ( Nishida et al . , 1987 ) . Yeast and mammalian cofilin have similar activities in vitro , and their analogous subcellular localizations indicate that the cellular roles of the proteins might also be conserved . How - ever , there are conditions under which the localizations of mammalian and yeast cofilins are not similar . Upon heat shock or treatment with 10 % DMSO , abnormal actin bars similar to the cytoplasmic bars described above are found in the nucleus of mammalian cells ( Nishida et al . , 1987 ) . Residues 26 - 34 of the mammalian protein ( P - - - KKRKK ) resemble the SV - 40 large T - antigen nuclear localization sig - nal ( Matsuzaki et al . , 1988 ) . Mutation of the sequence to P - - - KTLKK prevents the nuclear accumulation of cofilin ( Iida et al . , 1992 ) . The corresponding region of yeast cofilin contains the sequence GKKYK , but this does not appear to function as a nuclear localization signal . We have never seen yeast coflin in the nucleus , even upon subjecting cells to heat shock ( data not shown ) . Dephosphorylation of mammalian cofilin accompanies its nuclear accumulation upon heat shock or DMSO treatment ( Ohta et al . , 1989 ) . It has been suggested ( Ohta et al . , 1989 ) that phosphorylation of Ser 24 , which is a potential Ca2 + / calmodulin - dependent protein ki - nase II target and is two residues upstream of the putative Moon et al . Cofilin Is Essential for Yeast Viability 433 on A p r il 20 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published January 15 , 1993 nuclear localization signal P - - - KKRKK , might somehow prevent recognition of that sequence as a nuclear localization signal . The sequence of yeast cofilin does not reveal any potential phosphorylation sites in this region that might pre - vent nuclear accumulation . When mouse fibroblastic cells cultured under normal conditions are stained for cofilin , some nuclear localization is also seen ( Yonezawa et al . , 1987 ) . These observations suggest that the mammalian pro - tein might have roles in the nucleus that the yeast protein does not have . We show that the entire cofilin sequence is similar to the NH2 - terminal 16 kD of Abplp . Yeast cofilin localization is also identical to that of Abplp . Despite these similarities , the presence of ABP1 on a multicopy plasmid cannot compensate for the loss of cofilin , suggesting that the two proteins do not have redundant functions in the cell . Since loss of Abplp has no mutant phenotype , we cannot perform the reciprocal ex - periment . Like cofilin , we known that Abplp binds to actin filaments ; it is now important to determine whether Abplp has severing activity and / or monomer binding activity . The configuration of Abplp with an NH2 - terminal cofilin do - main and a COOH - terminal SH3 domain is analogous to my - osin I , which has an NH2 - terminal motor domain with a COOH - terminal SH3 domain ( Drubin et al . , 1990 ) . The SH3 domain of the Abl nonreceptor tyrosine kinase binds to a guanosine triphosphatase - activating - like protein ( Cic - chetti et al . , 1992 ) . Similar interactions involving SH3 do - mains may provide a linkage between signal transduction proteins and cytoskeletal proteins . While the potential cofilin - like activity of Abplp might be controlled in part by its SH3 domain , other means of regulat - ing cofilin activity in vivo are suggested by experiments done in vitro . The interaction of mammalian cofilin with actin is influenced in vitro by both pH ( Yonezawa et al . , 1985 ) and phospholipid binding ( Yonezawa et al . , 1990 ) . Mammalian cofllin is also phosphorylated in vivo ; this modification has not been demonstrated to influence cofilin ' s actin binding ac - tivity or cellular distribution ( Ohta et al . , 1989 ) . Our prelim - inary results indicate that the phospholipid inhibition of cofilin ' s activity is conserved in yeast . This is consistent with peptide studies that suggest that the highly conserved region containing the WAPECAPLKSKM sequence is important for both actin and phospholipid binding ( Yonezawa et al . , 199 la ) . Phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate has been im - plicated in the regulation of several actin binding proteins , including the monomer sequestering protein profilin ( Lass - ing and Lindberg , 1985 ) and the actin severing / nucleating protein gelsolin ( Janmey and Stossel , 1987 ) . Compared with profilin and gelsolin , cofilin binds with nearly equal affinity to a larger range of phospholipids ( phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate , phosphatidylinositol 4 - monophosphate , and phosphatidylinositol ) ( Yonezawa et al . , 1990 ) . The abil - ity to differentially regulate proteins with overlapping bio - chemical activities may be important for cellular coordina - tion of actin cytoskeleton dynamics . Cofilin is an essential component of the yeast cortical actin cytoskeleton . Capping protein , fimbrin , and Abplp have pre - viously been shown to be present in the yeast membrane cytoskeleton ( Drubin et al . , 1988 ; Amatruda and Cooper , 1992 ) . The membrane cytoskeleton of yeast dynamically redistributes to determine the sites of cell surface growth . Regulation of the multiple actin binding activities at the cell cortex is likely to be central to the ability of a yeast cell to develop different morphologies in response to cell cycle sig - nals , nutrient limitation ( Gimeno et al . , 1992 ) , or phero - mone gradients ( Jackson and Hartwell , 1990 ) .
