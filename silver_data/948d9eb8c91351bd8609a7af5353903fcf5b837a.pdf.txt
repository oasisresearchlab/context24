Here , we identify a plethora of putative OR enhancers and study their in vivo activity in olfactory neurons . Distinguished by an unusual epigenetic signature , candidate OR enhancers are character - ized by extensive interchromosomal interactions associated with OR transcription and share a similar pattern of transcription factor footprints . In partic - ular , we establish the role of the transcription factor Bptf as a facilitator of both enhancer interactions and OR transcription . Our observations agree with the model whereby OR transcription occurs in the context of multiple interacting enhancers . Disruption of these interchromosomal interactions results in weak and multigenic OR expression , suggesting that the rare coincidence of numerous enhancers over a stochastically chosen OR may account for the singularity and robustness in OR transcription . INTRODUCTION The olfactory system has the ability to detect and distinguish among an astounding number of olfactory stimuli ( Bushdid et al . , 2014 ) . This vast receptive ﬁeld is afforded by the large repertoire of olfactory receptors ( OR ) , which , in most mammals , are encoded by more than a thousand genes located in numerous genomic clusters throughout the genome ( Buck and Axel , 1991 ; Sullivan et al . , 1996 ; Zhang et al . , 2004 ) . ORs are expressed in olfactory sensory neurons ( OSNs ) in a monogenic , monoallelic , and seemingly stochastic fashion ( Chess et al . , 1994 ) in such a way that each neuron expresses only one out of the (cid:1) 2 , 800 available alleles . For each OSN , the identity of the expressed OR determines the spectrum of chemicals that it responds to and its connectivity to the brain ( Wang et al . , 1998 ) . The dual role of ORs in odor detection and axon guidance makes the singularity of their expression critical for olfactory perception ; were multiple ORs coexpressed in each OSN , the topographic map of OSN projections to the olfactory bulb would be perturbed , likely resulting in reduced olfactory sensitivity and resolution . The continuous transcription of a single OR is maintained by an OR - elicited feedback signal that stabilizes the expression of the chosen OR and prevents the activation of additional ones ( Ferreira et al . , 2014 ; Lewcock and Reed , 2004 ; Serizawa et al . , 2003 ; Shykind et al . , 2004 ) . In mammals , this feedback uses components of the unfolded protein response ( UPR ) to detect the newly translated OR in the endoplasmic reticulum and to induce transient translation of transcription factor Atf5 ( Dalton et al . , 2013 ) . Atf5 orchestrates , among others , the expression of Adcy3 , the major adenylyl cyclase in the OSNs that is necessary for stable OR transcription and OSN differenti - ation . Adcy3 expression makes OR choice permanent by signaling for the downregulation of Lsd1 , a lysine demethylase with dual coactivator and corepressor activities that regulate OR expression ( Lyons et al . , 2013 ) . This feedback system is only possible because OR silencing , via the hallmarks of consti - tutive heterochromatin , occurs early , during OSN differentiation , and before the onset of OR transcription ( Magklara et al . , 2011 ) . This epigenetic silencing is reinforced by the nuclear conver - gence of OR loci into a few , OR - speciﬁc heterochromatic foci ( Clowney et al . , 2012 ) . Active OR alleles escape these foci , sup - porting a role of the spatial compartmentalization between active and inactive OR alleles to the singular OR expression ( Armelin - Correa et al . , 2014 ) . Indeed , disrupting the nuclear architecture of OSNs violates the ‘‘one receptor per neuron’’ rule , causing co - expression of multiple OR alleles per neuron , albeit at reduced levels ( Clowney et al . , 2012 ) . These observations provide the molecular underpinnings of the feedback signal and emphasize the importance of gene silencing in OR gene regulation ; however , they do not explain how a single OR allele is selected for transcriptional activation Cell 159 , 543 – 557 , October 23 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Inc . 543 A B C D E F Figure 1 .

We previously hypothesized that an intergenic OR enhancer , H , could provide this singularity because it frequently associates with transcriptionally active OR alleles from the same or different chromosomes ( Lomvardas et al . , 2006 ) . However , deletion of the H enhancer affects only the expression of three linked and proximal ORs ( Khan et al . , 2011 ) . Redundancy for the function of H as a trans enhancer , provided by additional H - like elements , could explain why the physical association with H appears to be genetically superﬂu - ous for the transcription of most ORs ( Williams et al . , 2010 ) . This model , which predicts an intricate network of genomic inter - actions ( Bargmann , 2006 ) , ascribes two distinct roles to each intergenic OR enhancer : a critical function as a cis regulatory element , which may open up the local chromatin architecture , orchestrating the ﬁrst step of OR choice , and a redundant func - tion as a trans enhancer which , together with other enhancers , facilitates high rates of OR transcription . To identify elements that may provide redundancy for H as a trans enhancer , we performed a genome - wide search for inter - genic OR enhancers . DNase I hypersensitivity ( DHS ) - sequencing ( DHS - seq ) and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing ( ChIP - seq ) experiments uncovered 35 predicted enhancer ele - ments linked to OR gene clusters . Reporter assays in zebraﬁsh embryos , followed by transgenic and knockout experiments in the mouse , support the function of at least 12 elements as OSN - speciﬁc enhancers that likely regulate OR transcription . Importantly , circularized chromosome conformation capture sequencing ( 4C - seq ) analyses of sorted OSNs , combined with two - and three - color DNA ﬂuorescent in situ hybridization ( FISH ) experiments , demonstrate the convergence of multiple enhancers over the chosen OR . Hi - C analysis with chromatin from the whole main olfactory epithelium ( MOE ) , along with DNA FISH experiments , revealed extensive inter - and intrachro - mosomal interactions between most of these elements in olfac - tory neurons . Finally , two independent genetic manipulations that disrupt robust OR expression , ectopic expression of Lbr in mature OSNs and conditional deletion of Bptf , a transcription factor predicted to bind to these enhancers by in vivo footprint - ing experiments , result in signiﬁcant decrease of trans enhancer interactions accompanying the signiﬁcant reduction of OR tran - scription . Our experiments , which reveal the regulatory land - scape of OR enhancers , propose a model of singular OR choice that depends upon the convergence of multiple enhancers in a three - dimensional nucleoprotein complex that regulates robust OR expression . RESULTS To examine the epigenetic state of the H enhancer and to use this information for the identiﬁcation of novel OR enhancers , we per - formed DHS - seq ( Thurman et al . , 2012 ) and ChIP - seq for H3K4me1 and H3K27ac ( Table S1 available online ) . DHS and enhancer mark enrichment is observed at enhancers of OSN - transcribed genes , such as the protocadherin alpha enhancers ( Ribich et al . , 2006 ) ( Figure S1A ) . The H enhancer sequence is also enriched for H3K4me1 and H3K27ac and has a well - deﬁned DHS peak ( Figure 1A ) , suggesting that H is transcriptionally engaged in more cells than the small fraction of neurons that ex - press the proximal OR genes on which we do not detect acti - vating histone marks in whole MOE preparations . The second known OR enhancer , the P element ( Khan et al . , 2011 ) , also has the same features as H . To identify additional elements that share the chromatin pattern of the H enhancer , we performed a computational search for intergenic ChIP - seq and DHS - seq peaks using SICER ( Zang et al . , 2009 ) . To remove enhancers that might generally specify neuronal cell types , we ﬁltered out regions that overlapped with H3K4me1 and H3K27ac peaksfrom cerebellum ChIP - seq exper - iments that we performed in parallel ( Figure S1B ) . However , even upon thisﬁltering , there are 4 , 750intergenicsequences that have these characteristics in a MOE - speciﬁc fashion . To reduce this number , we restricted the search to only intergenic regions residing within OR gene clusters ( and 100 Kb upstream and downstream oftheseclusters ) . Thisstrategyreducedthenumber of positive hits to 35 , with an average distance of (cid:1)(cid:1) 35 Kb from the nearest OR ( Figure S1B and Table S2 ) . We also searched for other epigenetic marks that may be used to distinguish OR enhancers from the rest of the MOE - spe - ciﬁc regulatory elements . Two histone modiﬁcations associated with repression , H3K79me3 and H3K27me3 ( Barski et al . , 2007 ; Ernst et al . , 2011 ) , have a unique distribution at the H locus—they are missing from the actual enhancer sequence but are enriched in the ﬂanking sequences ( Figure 1A ) . Visual inspection of the remaining OR enhancer candidates shows that this pattern is shared among 23 of the 35 potential enhancer elements ( ex - ample in Figure 1B ) . Aggregate plots comparing ChIP - seq and DHS - seq reads on OR proximal elements and predicted MOE enhancers located outside OR clusters highlight the speciﬁcity of this epigenetic signature ( Figure 1C ) . Indeed , although 65 % of predicted OR enhancers overlap with regions of H3K79me3 enrichment , only 2 . 6 % ( 126 / 4 , 750 ) of all the predicted MOE enhancers show this overlap ( Figure S1B ) . Interestingly , in Drosophila embryos , H3K79me3 enrichment is found on devel - opmentally regulated enhancers ( Bonn et al . , 2012 ) . Functional Analysis of Predicted OR Enhancers We sought a functional assay that is appropriate for a high - throughput in vivo enhancer screen . We performed transient reporter assays in zebraﬁsh embryos and scored for MOE - spe - ciﬁc reporter expression as previously described ( Booker et al . , 2013 ) . Although the predicted OR enhancer sequences are not conserved to zebraﬁsh , the H element supports reporter expres - sion in zebraﬁsh OSNs ( Nishizumi et al . , 2007 ) , suggesting that this assay is appropriate for the functional identiﬁcation of OR ( D ) Schematic depicting the E1b - tol2 expression construct .

Inspired by a previous description of enhancers as ‘‘islands’’ composing a ‘‘regulatory archipelago’’ ( Montavon et al . , 2011 ) , we named the potential OR enhancers after Greek islands , a nomenclature that will be followed throughout the manuscript . We cloned the DHS peaks of 32 islands into a Tol2 retrotransposon - based reporter vector with a minimal pro - moter and GFP ( Figure 1D and Table S3B ) ( Li et al . , 2010 ) . Each construct was injected into one - cell stage zebraﬁsh oocytes , and GFP expression was monitored during embryogenesis at 24 and 48 hr postfertilization . Speciﬁc GFP expression was observed in OSNs of the olfactory epithelium for 12 of the se - quences screened ( Figures 1E , 1F , S1C , and S1D ) . Empty vector controls do not support GFP expression in zebraﬁsh OSNs . To identify potential differences between active and inactive enhancers , we summarized the levels of histone modiﬁcations around DHS peaks using principal component analysis . The ﬁrst principle component ( PC1 ) of each modiﬁcation robustly repre - sents its overall level at each enhancer locus . Ordering candidate OR enhancers by H3K79me3 PC1 grouped together enhancers that were active in zebraﬁsh OSNs , as well as the H and P elements ( Figure S1E ) . This set of enhancers had high levels of ﬂanking H3K79me3 . Ordering by H3K4me1 PC1 shows that en - hancers that were active in zebraﬁsh OSNs had relatively lower levels of H3K4me1 ( Figure S1F ) . Interestingly , OR genes prox - imal to these 11 elements are more highly expressed than the average OR by RNA - seq of mouse OSNs ( Figure S2A ) . To further validate the zebraﬁsh reporter assay , we generated transgenic b - galactosidase ( b - gal ) reporter lines using a reporter vector driven by the hsp68 minimal promoter ( Kothary et al . , 1988 ) . We tested three zebraﬁsh - positive elements , Sfaktiria , Lipsi , and Kefallonia ( Table S2 ) , referred to as Sfaktiria - lacZ , Lipsi - lacZ , and Kefallonia - lacZ in the rest of the manuscript . Whole - mount x - gal staining of these transgenic mice shows widespread reporter expression speciﬁcally in the MOE similar to the H - lacZ transgenic , which we generated as positive control ( Figures 2A – 2D and S2B ) . Immunoﬂuorescence ( IF ) for b - gal in the MOE of the Sfaktiria - lacZ mouse also shows widespread expression ( Figure 2E ) . In the olfactory bulb , b - gal - positive axons target multiple glomeruli and express the glutamate transporter Vglut2 ( Figures 2F and 2G ) , indicating that this enhancer drives expression in mature OSNs . In contrast , there is no b - gal IF signal in Neurogenin - 1 positive neurons ( Figure S2C ) , which suggests that enhancer activity is synchronous to OR expression . Similar results were obtained from Lipsi - lacZ and Kefallonia - lacZ transgenics ( data not shown ) . In contrast , b - gal is coexpressed with olfactory receptor Olfr1507 in Sfaktiria - lacZ transgenics crossed to Olfr1507iresGFP knockin mice ( Barnea et al . , 2004 ) ( Figure 2H ) . These transgenic reporter assays demonstrate an OSN - spe - ciﬁc enhancer activity for the candidate OR enhancers . To test the requirement of these elements in OR expression , we deleted one of them , Lipsi , which is located on chromosome 2 between Ofr362 and Olfr364 . Our targeting strategy deleted , by homolo - gous recombination , 1 , 000 bp of conserved sequence corre - sponding to the DHS peak at this location ( Figure 2I ) . qRT - PCR analysis on RNA prepared from wild - type and Lipsi KO litter - mates shows marked reduction in expression of the eight ge - nomically linked ORs that reside within this genomic cluster on chromosome 2 , whereas ORs from a distant genomic cluster in the same or different chromosomes are unaffected ( Figure 2J ) . RNA in situ hybridization ( ISH ) analysis in MOE sections from Lipsi KO and wild - type littermates conﬁrms that expression of ORs from this genomic cluster is abolished ( Figures 2K and S2D ) . Multiple Enhancers Interact in trans with a Transcriptionally Active OR Our data thus far provide a comprehensive epigenetic and ge - netic characterization of intergenic DNA elements that may act as OR enhancers . To examine whether these elements associate with active OR genes in trans , like the H enhancer ( Lomvardas et al . , 2006 ) , we performed 4C on an isolated population of OSNs expressing Olfr1507 . We chose Olfr1507 for this experi - ment because its expression depends on the genomically linked H enhancer . Thus , it provides an ideal gene locus for testing the hypothesis that a cis enhancer may act in concert with trans en - hancers . 4C was performed on ﬂuorescence - activated cell ( FAC ) - sorted neurons from Olfr1507iresGFP knockin mice , and libraries were ampliﬁed with inverse PCR primers anchored at the Olfr1507 promoter as previously described ( Clowney et al . , 2012 ) . 4C libraries from GFP + and GFP (cid:3) cells were analyzed by qPCR to quantitate the relative enrichment of various DNA loci . Several of the newly identiﬁed sequences are enriched in the library corresponding to GFP + cells at levels approaching the enrichment levels of H ( Figure 3A ) . Enrichment is signiﬁcantly reduced in GFP (cid:3) cells , which suggests that these associations are restricted to cells that transcribe Olfr1507 . Two - color DNA FISH analysis ( Figure 3B ) veriﬁed that the Olfr1507 locus frequently colocalizes in trans with the three most highly en - riched elements , Lipsi ( chr2 ) , Sfaktiria ( chr6 ) , and Crete ( chr11 ) , in OSNs immunolabeled with an anti - Olfr1507 antibody ( (cid:1) 63 % of Olfr1507 + OSNs , n = 124 for each pair ) . Similar results were obtained by FISH in Olfr1507iresGFP MOEs using anti - GFP im - munolabeling ( Figure S3A ) . Three - color DNA FISH ( Figure 3C ) re - vealed that Olfr1507 colocalizes with both Lipsi and Crete in 16 % of Olfr1507 + OSNs , a highly signiﬁcant increase over the fre - quency of colocalization of the three loci in Olfr1507 (cid:3) OSNs ( 0 . 2 % , n = 406 , p = 2E - 10 , chi - square test ) ( Figure 3D ) . Thus , as the network of enhancer interactions becomes more com - plex , it remains associated with OR transcription . To explore the long - range interactions of Olfr1507 in an unbi - ased fashion , we generated 4C - seq libraries generated from GFP + and GFP (cid:3) cells from Olfr1507iresGFP mice ( Figure S3B ) . In agreement with our qPCR analysis , 4C - seq revealed multiple contacts between Olfr1507 and 15 candidate OR enhancers , nine of which are functional in zebraﬁsh OSNs ( Figures S3C – S3E and Table S5 ) . Interactions with OR enhancers were signif - icantly ( p < 0 . 01 , Wilcoxon t test ) stronger in Olfr1507 + OSNs compared to the negative population ( Figure 3E ) . The network of interchromosomal interactions between Olfr1507 and pre - dicted OR enhancers is depicted in Figure 3F . Extensive cis and trans Interactions between Potential OR Enhancers in OSNs To examine the extent of putative enhancer interactions in OSNs , we performed Hi - C analysis in the whole MOE . To speciﬁcally interrogate the interactions of OR enhancer candidates , we 546 Cell 159 , 543 – 557 , October 23 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Inc . performed a modiﬁed Capture - C protocol ( Hughes et al . , 2014 ) ( see Extended Experimental Procedures ) . Our analysis revealed that 32 / 35 elements associate in high frequency with other en - hancers from this repertoire . These interactions appear to be highly speciﬁc ; there is a signiﬁcant ( p < 0 . 01 , Wilcoxon t test ) 20 - fold enrichment for reads that span two different potential OR enhancers compared to reads that span an OR enhancer and one of the other MOE enhancers ( Figure 4A ) . Within the observed repertoire , there are ‘‘promiscuous’’ enhancers that form frequent interactions with many other elements ( Evia and A B C D E F G H I J K Figure 2 .

Gavdos ) , whereas others form fewer interactions ( Nimos and Lemnos ) . A contact matrix depicting the pairwise frequencies of these interactions organized by hierarchical clustering reveals the existence of four clusters of potential enhancers exhibiting similar frequencies of interactions ( Figure 4B ) . Enhancers located on chromosomes 2 , 3 , 7 , and 16 make the most frequent contacts with each other and with enhancers from other chromo - somes ( Figure 4C ) . To independently verify the Hi - C data , we performed two - co - lor DNA FISH analysis on sections of the MOE ( Figures 4D , 4E , and S4 ) . DNA sequences that interact infrequently by Hi - C , like Nimos , exhibit a low frequency of colocalization with other OR enhancers both in OSNs and in sustentacular cells , a non - neuronal cell type of the MOE that we used as an internal control ( Figure 4D ) . In contrast , increased Hi - C interactions generally correspond to frequent colocalizations by DNA FISH that are restricted to OSNs . On average , enhancer - enhancer colocalizations are (cid:1) 6 times more prevalent in OSNs than in sustentacular cells ( n = 3 , 264 nuclei ; p = 10 (cid:3) 44 , chi - square test ) . As in the Hi - C experiment , enhancer - enhancer interac - tions are speciﬁc to OR enhancers , as colocalizations with pre - dicted MOE enhancers are not signiﬁcantly increased in OSNs compared to sustentacular cells ( Figure 4D ) . It is worth noting that sequences engaged in interchromosomal contacts include those that were not functional in the zebraﬁsh reporter assay , suggesting that they may have functional regulatory roles in the mouse . The Regulatory Landscape of OR Enhancers Because enhancer - bound transcription factors mediate long - range genomic interactions ( Nolis et al . , 2009 ) , we searched for proteins that bind on candidate OR enhancers in order to obtain mechanistic insight into the formation of these intricate in - terchromosomal associations . For an unbiased search of re - gulatory sequences , we sought to isolate DNase I protected sequences on the candidate enhancers . In vivo footprinting by DHS - seq was recently used to identify , in a high - throughput fashion , regulatory sequences and factors that control cell - type - speciﬁc differentiation ( Neph et al . , 2012a , 2012b ) . To in - crease the depth of our DHS - seq reads on the 35 putative enhancers , we employed a similar sequence capture strategy as done for Hi - C , using oligos tiling the OR enhancer candidates ( Figure 5A ) and modifying a recently published enrichment strat - egy ( Stergachis et al . , 2013 ) . After enrichment , DHS - seq read coverage of the OR en - hancers increased (cid:1) 10 , 000 - fold ( Figure 5A ) . Mapping DNase I cleavage sites across the H enhancer revealed multiple se - quences that are protected from DNase I digestion ( Figure S5A ) and that can be computationally identiﬁed as footprints ( Neph et al . , 2012b ) . We performed a motif search of footprinted se - quences in the 12 enhancers with conﬁrmed zebraﬁsh activity using MEME ( Bailey and Elkan , 1994 ) . This analysis revealed four protected sequence motifs , which match predicted binding sites for Atf5 , Evx2 / Lhx2 , Olf / Ebf , and Hdx ( Figures 5B and S5B ) . Interestingly , three of these factors , Atf5 , Olf / Ebf , and Lhx2 , have reported roles in OR gene regulation ( Dalton et al . , 2013 ; Hirota and Mombaerts , 2004 ; Rothman et al . , 2005 ) . ChIP experiments for Lhx2 , for which we were able to obtain a ChIP - quality antibody , revealed enrichment on OR enhancers containing Lhx2 motifs ( Figure S5C , see Extended Experimental Procedures ) , providing independent veriﬁcation of the in vivo occupancy data . Next , we expanded our search to the complete repertoire of enhancers identiﬁed by epigenetic analysis . Across the 35 po - tential enhancers , 1 , 040 footprints were identiﬁed with signiﬁ - cant footprint occupancy scores ( FOS < 0 . 5 ) ( Table S4A ) . Eleven TF motifs from the TRANSFAC database had median footprint scoresoflessthanone , indicating DNaseIprotection ( Figure 5C ) . Homeodomain TF motifs comprise the majority of the footprinted motifs . Four TF motifs ( Nobox , Foxj2 , Cdx , and C / EBPgamma ) have p values < 0 . 05 and exhibit protection of the consensus sequence across all OR enhancers ( Figure 5D ) . Among con - sensus sequences with reduced FOS , the predicted binding motif for transcription factor Bptf ( bromo and PHD - ﬁnger tran - scription factor ) ( Jordan - Sciutto et al . , 1999 ) appeared as a promising candidate protein that may be involved in the forma - tion or stabilization of long - range genomic interactions . As the histone binding component of the NURF chromatin remodeling complex , Bptf binds acetylated and methylated histone tails from different histones through the bromo and PHD - ﬁnger do - mains , respectively ( Ruthenburg et al . , 2011 ) , which could po - tentially mediate the bridging of chromatin ﬁbers from different chromosomes . Bptf has previously been shown to facilitate expression of Hox genes via chromatin remodeling at cis - regula - tory sequences ( Wysocka et al . , 2006 ) but has yet to be impli - cated in OR expression . To examine the functional signiﬁcance of Bptf binding on OR - proximal enhancers , we conditionally deleted Bptf in the MOE by Figure 3 .

We refer to the Foxg1 - cre , Bptf ﬂox / ﬂox mouse as the Bptf KO . These mice die perinatally , thus re - stricting our analysis to E18 . 5 embryos . IF for Olfr1507 in sec - tions from Bptf KO and control MOEs showed complete loss of expression of this OR in the Bptf KO ( Figure 6A ) . RNA ISH using a complex probe detecting several hundred ORs ( see Extended Experimental Procedures ) also showed a dramatic reduction in OR expression ( Figures 6B and 6G ) . GAP43 and Ncam1 , markers of immature OSNs that are synchronous to OR expres - sion ( Lyons et al . , 2013 ) , are still expressed in Bptf KO MOEs , suggesting that the loss of OR expression is not caused by loss of the OSN lineage ( Figures 6C and 6D ) . Finally , a general deﬁcit in OR expression is corroborated by the loss of mature OSN markers , such as OMP , Adcy3 , and Vglut2 , in the Bptf KO MOE ( Figures 6E and 6F ) . To test whether Bptf participates in the establishment or main - tenance of associations between potential OR enhancers , we performed two - color DNA FISH in sections of control and Bptf KO MOEs . This analysis revealed a signiﬁcant decrease in the frequency of interactions between H - Lipsi and H - Sfaktiria in Bptf KO OSNs ( Figure 6H ; p = 0 . 0005 and p = 0 . 002 , respectively , chi - square test ; n = 356 nuclei ) . Importantly , the overall chro - matin architecture of Bptf KO OSNs remains intact , and the ag - gregation of OR foci is not impaired ( Figure 6I ) , suggesting a rather speciﬁc role of this protein in enhancer interactions and OR gene activation . OR Gene Aggregation Facilitates Enhancer Interactions in trans An important question emerging from our analyses is whether frequent enhancer interactions are a consequence of OR gene aggregation in OSN nuclei . The fact that we detect enhancer co - localization with Olfr1507 more frequently in Olfr1507 + cells sug - gests that these associations would preferentially occur outside the repressive OR foci , which is where the transcriptionally active ORs also reside ( Clowney et al . , 2012 ) . Two - color DNA FISH shows that 60 % of H or Lipsi alleles colocalize with a complex DNA FISH probe that recognizes most OR loci ( panOR probe ) ( Figure 7A ) . However , three - color DNA FISH shows that H and Lipsi colocalization occurs preferentially outside the OR foci ( p < 10 (cid:3) 12 ; n = 1 , 530 ; chi - square test ) within euchromatic nuclear territories ( Figures 7A and 7B ) . Thus , enhancer interactions in trans may be favored by—but are not a simple product of—the convergence of linked ORs , a result that is consistent with the observation that Bptf deletion impairs enhancer interactions , but not OR aggregation . It is possible that the differentiation - dependent aggregation of OR loci instead facilitates enhancer interactions by bringing the elements into close proximity . To test this , we analyzed the fre - quency of interchromosomal associations between potential OR enhancers in OSNs that express Lamin b receptor ( Lbr ) . We previously showed that ectopic Lbr expression in OSNs disrupts the aggregation of OR genes and the interaction of the H enhancer with OR genes in trans , but not in cis ( Clowney et al . , 2012 ) . 4C - qPCR analysis of control and Lbr + FAC - sorted OSNs revealed signiﬁcant reduction in the frequency of trans in - teractions between potential OR enhancers upon Lbr expression ( Figure 7C ) , supporting a role for the unusual nuclear architecture of OSNs , and possibly for the aggregation of OR loci , in the frequent association of predicted OR enhancers from different chromosomes . Importantly , because OR transcription is signiﬁ - cantly reduced in Lbr + OSNs ( Clowney et al . , 2012 ) , these data provide an independent genetic manipulation whereby the spe - ciﬁc disruption of trans enhancer interactions reduces OR tran - scription rates . Thus , the same process that contributes to the effective silencing of OR transcription , the aggregation of OR genes in heterochromatic foci , may also facilitate the activation of a single allele by increasing the probability of enhancer - enhancer interactions . DISCUSSION Our experiments revealed 35 intergenic OR - linked sequences that share common epigenetic properties with the H element , the prototypical OR enhancer . In addition to common enhancer features , these sequences are characterized by high ﬂanking levels of H3K79me3 . Currently , it is not clear whether these epigenetic marks coexist on the same enhancer alleles or whether they reﬂect different states of these elements in the total cellular population . In any case , our reporter screen showed that 12 of the 32 elements that were tested regulate OSN - speciﬁc expression in zebraﬁsh OSNs and revealed a positive associa - tion between ﬂanking H3K79me3 enrichment and enhancer ac - tivity . We demonstrated the activity of three of these elements ( Lipsi , Sfaktiria , and Kefallonia ) as OSN enhancers in the mouse , and we showed that Lipsi is necessary for the expression of proximal OR genes . Because zebraﬁsh reporter assays for mammalian enhancers generate false negatives ( Ariza - Cosano et al . , 2012 ; Booker et al . , 2013 ; McGaughey et al . , 2008 ) , it is likely that many of the DNA elements that did not activate tran - scription in zebraﬁsh OSNs are mammalian or mouse - speciﬁc OR enhancers , especially in light of their extensive interactions with veriﬁed enhancers . It is worth noting that our screen is far from being saturated because enhancers that are transcription - ally engaged in a smaller cell population would not meet our computational thresholds , and enhancers with a different epige - netic signature would be ignored . Our experiments revealed an unusual network of genomic in - teractions occurring predominantly between putative OR - asso - ciated enhancers from different chromosomes . Interactions identiﬁed by Hi - C were veriﬁed by extensive DNA FISH experi - ments , which demonstrated that sequences from different chro - mosomes colocalize in up to 35 % of OSN nuclei . 4C - seq from FAC - sorted OSNs and three - color DNA FISH experiments sustentacular cells , probably due tothegenomiclinkage oftheseDNAelements , whichbothreside on chromosome 7at9MBdistance .

Previous work showed that H interacts in cis and in trans with the transcription - ally active OR allele ( Lomvardas et al . , 2006 ) .

An OR gene ( orange box ) located proximal to an enhancer ( orange circle ) is repressed by H3K9me3 ( red ﬂag , D ) . The cis - proximal enhancer may facilitate derepression of the OR chromatin landscape ( green ﬂag , E ) but is not sufﬁcient for OR tran - scription . Multiple trans - interacting enhancers ( colored circles ) aggregate around the transcribed cis - proximal OR ( orange box , F ) . 554 Cell 159 , 543 – 557 , October 23 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Inc . Delpretti et al . , 2013 ; Guo et al . , 2012 ; Montavon et al . , 2011 ; Noordermeer et al . , 2014 ) . Thus , enhancers may act in an addi - tive or even synergistic fashion to increase transcription rates . Given that ORs likely represent the most abundant protein - coding mRNAs in OSNs , it is possible that the convergence of multiple enhancers contributes to the robustness of OR tran - scription . Coordinated action between multiple loci in trans has been also described for the activation of the human IFN b gene , which is also expressed in a stochastic but robust fashion upon virus induction ( Apostolou and Thanos , 2008 ) . Finally , ge - netic experiments suggest that a DNA sequence may act as a trans enhancer during the stochastic photoreceptor gene choice in Drosophila ommatidia ( Johnston and Desplan , 2014 ) . Thus , while the Hox genes , with restrictive spatiotemporal expression requirements , use an ‘‘archipelago’’ of cis regulatory elements to achieve precise expression patterns , systems that tolerate or even seek stochasticity may utilize trans interactions to obtain robust but low probability transcriptional outputs . Currently , there is no direct evidence of a role of these interac - tions in OR transcription . Previous work showed that deletion of H does not affect expression of more than three proximal OR al - leles , despite the physical association of this enhancer with mul - tiple other ORs . Similarly , deletion of P or Lipsi appears to affect the expression of linked OR alleles only , a result also observed in H , P double - KO mice ( Khan et al . , 2011 ) . However , with at least 15 enhancer elements interacting frequently with the Olfr1507 promoter in Olfr1507 + OSNs , it is expected that deletion of a sin - gle trans enhancer does not elicit transcriptional consequences . In contrast , if each of these elements is required for a critical step in the transcriptional activation of cis - linked OR genes , such as orchestrating the desilencing of the linked ORs , then each indi - vidual deletion may be sufﬁcient for a detectable transcriptional effect in cis ( Figures 7D – 7F ) , explaining why these enhancers are required in cis but are redundant in trans . To test this model of trans enhancement , we perturbed the ability of these elements to interact with each other in trans . Two independent experiments , deletion of Bptf and expression of Lbr in OSNs , resulted in signiﬁcant downregulation of OR tran - scription , to the extent that ORs are not detectable by RNA in situ hybridization ( ISH ) or IF in the mutant OSNs . Although in both cases we cannot directly attribute the downregulation of OR transcription to the reduced frequency of trans interactions , these results are consistent with our model . Recent experiments showed that an increase in the number of homeodomain and O / E sites on the promoters of transgenic ORs increases the fre - quency by which they are transcribed ( Vassalli et al . , 2011 ) . Because the only way to increase the local concentration of binding sites for these transcription factors near an OR promoter is to recruit sites from other genomic regions , this result is consistent with the hypothesis that each enhancer on its own is required , but not sufﬁcient , for the expression of proximal ORs . There are alternative interpretations of our data that do not invoke coordinated action between distant OR enhancers . For example , enhancer convergence may reﬂect the existence of specialized nuclear bodies or factories with high afﬁnity for these enhancers and for the protein complex that supports OR tran - scription . Such a nuclear body is described in the regulation of VSG genes in trypanosome ( Navarro and Gull , 2001 ) . Moreover , sequestering these putative enhancers into distinct nuclear terri - tories may primarily prevent them from interacting with their proximal ORs , essentially ‘‘decommissioning’’ a large number of elements in each OSN . Thus , enhancer convergence may serve two functions : to eliminate the possibility of simultaneous choice of multiple ORs and to ensure robust expression of the single active OR . In summary , our data are consistent with a model in which the robust transcription of an OR requires an enhancer in cis and numerous enhancers in trans . High levels of OR expression may be necessary for activation of the Perk pathway via ER stress , and it is likely that only ORs expressed above a certain threshold can elicit this feedback . This prediction is consistent with the observation that transgenic ORs expressed at low levels from heterologous promoters can be coexpressed with endoge - nous ORs ( Zhou and Belluscio , 2012 ) . Because the vetting mechanism that stabilizes OR choice may screen for both the quality and quantity of OR protein , ORs transcribed at subopti - mal levels will be turned off by sustained Lsd1 expression . If the number of enhancers associating with an OR promoter indeed determines expression levels , then stable OR expression will occur only once a sufﬁcient number of enhancer elements associate with an OR promoter . Simple modeling of the ob - served experimental frequencies of pairwise enhancer interac - tions predicts that the colocalization of 16 different enhancers from a repertoire of 35 will occur only once in each OSN nucleus ( see Extended Experimental Procedures ) . Thus , depending on the actual number of enhancers needed to achieve feedback - eliciting levels of OR transcription , the limited , or even unique generation of a nucleoprotein complex with sufﬁcient number of enhancers may provide the elusive singularity of OR choice . It seems counterintuitive that a sensory system critical for sur - vival and reproduction would rely on a molecular mechanism as inefﬁcient and probabilistic as the interchromosomal conver - gence of a large number of enhancer elements . However , unlike most developmental systems that are built upon tight spatiotem - poral regulation , the peripheral olfactory system may be able to tolerate such a variable and often nonproductive process because an efﬁcient feedback mechanism is in place to ensure that terminal OSN differentiation occurs only upon OR choice . This mechanism is compatible with the rapid evolution of the OR gene family , which is characterized by signiﬁcant copy num - ber variations among closely related species and signiﬁcant polymorphisms within species in accordance with the essential function of this gene family in adaptation . It remains to be seen if other fast - evolving gene families involved in the perception of—and the protection from—the constantly changing external environment ( Clowney et al . , 2011 ) may be employing similar radical mechanisms for stochastic and mutual exclusive gene expression .
