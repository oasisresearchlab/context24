One mechanism that may participate in this association is upregulation of inﬂammatory pathways . We used structural equation modeling to assess the interrelations between childhood obesity , OSA , inﬂammation , and metabolic dysfunction . One hundred and eighty - four children ( 127 boys , mean age : 8 . 5 ± 4 . 1years ) had height and weight measured , underwent overnight polysomnog - raphy and had fasting blood taken . The blood was analyzed for insulin , glucose , lipids , leptin , and cytokines [ interferon ( IFN ) - c , granulocyte macrophage – colony stimulating factor , interleukin ( IL ) - 1 b , IL - 2 , IL - 4 , IL - 6 , IL - 8 , IL - 10 , IL - 12 , tumor necrosis factor - a ] . Structural equation modeling ( SEM ) was used to evaluate associations between the outcomes of interest including hypoxia , arousal ( related to respiratory and spontane - ous ) , obesity , metabolic dysfunction , and inﬂammatory markers . Two cytokine factors and one metabolic factor were derived for the SEM . These factors provided good ﬁt in the structural equation model ( v 2 ⁄ df = 2 . 855 ; comparative ﬁt index = 0 . 90 , root mean squared error of approximation = 0 . 10 ) and all factor loadings were signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from zero ( P £ 0 . 01 ) . Overall , our results indicate that while obesity ( as measured by body mass index z - score ) has a major inﬂuence on the metabolic dysfunction associated with OSA , arousal indices , and cytokine markers may also inﬂuence this association . Our results support the hypothesis that OSA is a contributor to the mechanisms that link sleep , systemic inﬂammation and insulin resistance , and show that the interrelations may begin in childhood . keywords children , inﬂammation , metabolic syndrome , obstructive sleep apnea , structural equation model INTRODUCTION The term (cid:3) metabolic syndrome (cid:2) is used to identify a clustering of risk factors that indicates an increased risk for morbidity and mortality associated with cardiovascular disease . Although there is some debate regarding which factors are obligatory and which cut - points are used in the deﬁnition of the syndrome , this most commonly refers to the clustering of obesity , hypertension , insulin resistance ( type 2 diabetes ) , heart disease , and dyslipidemia ( Eckel et al . , 2005 ) . Independent associations have been demonstrated between obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) in adults and metabolic and cardiovascular complications ( Caples et al . , 2007 ; Kasasbeh et al . , 2006 ) . Similar associations have also been demonstrated in children ( NG et al . , 2005 ; Srinivasan et al . , 2006 ) ; children Correspondence : Karen A .

( 2007 ) 16 , 388 – 395 388 (cid:2) 2007 European Sleep Research Society with OSA have alterations in systemic blood pressure ( Amin et al . , 2004 ) and in echocardiographic variables ( Amin et al . , 2002 , 2005 ) . De la Eva et al . ( 2002 ) found a positive associ - ation between the severity of OSA and insulin resistance in obese children and Verhulst et al . ( 2007 ) found that oxygen saturation ( mean and nadir ) were independent signiﬁcant predicators for the presence of metabolic syndrome in over - weight children with sleep - disordered breathing . Inﬂammation is a mechanism that may link OSA and cardiovascular disease ( Parish and Somers , 2004 ; Ryan et al . , 2005 ) . Adults with OSA have higher levels of pro - inﬂamma - tory cytokines , tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) - a , and interleukin ( IL ) - 6 ( Alberti et al . , 2003 ; Vgontzas et al . , 1997 ) which decrease following treatment for OSA ( Kataoka et al . , 2004 ; Ohga et al . , 2003 ; Yokoe et al . , 2003 ) . Children with OSA also have higher levels of inﬂammation : Tauman et al . found raised levels of C - reactive protein ( CRP ) , a strong marker of cardiovascular risk , in children with sleep - disordered breath - ing , compared with controls , with levels correlating with disease severity . CRP levels were signiﬁcantly decreased 10 – 14 weeks after adenotonsillectomy in children with OSA ( Kheirandish - Gozal et al . , 2006 ) . Structural equation modeling is a comprehensive , ﬂexible approach to modeling associations between variables . Unlike anova or multiple regression techniques , which model individ - ual observations , SEM permits exploration of complex inter - relationships amongst a number of potentially inter - dependent variables . SEM usually starts with a hypothesis which is represented as a model . Measured ( observed ) and latent ( unobserved ) variables are (cid:3) factored (cid:2) into the model and various models are tested for goodness of ﬁt . It is important to note in SEM analysis that although the model may be a good ﬁt to the data , this does not necessarily imply that it is the best model for the data or that causal associations exist ( Bentler and Stein , 1992 ) . The advantages of SEM include more ﬂexible assumptions ( even when variables are collinear ) and the use of conﬁrmatory factor analysis , a technique used when there are many variables which may be explained by a smaller number of factors . SEM analysis was initially estab - lished in the psychometric literature ( Maccallum and Austin , 2000 ) , but has since been applied to medical and physiological models ( Yamanishi et al . , 2007 ) . The aim of this study was to use SEM to better evaluate the complex interrelationships between obesity , OSA , inﬂamma - tion , and metabolic dysfunction in children . The hypothesis that we modeled and tested was that an independent associ - ation exists between OSA and metabolic dysfunction in children , and that at least part of this association is explained by upregulation of inﬂammatory mediators . METHODS Study design Subjects were recruited consecutively when they presented for evaluation of suspected OSA to the Read Sleep Unit , The Children (cid:2) s Hospital at Westmead , Sydney , Australia . All parents completed a questionnaire inquiring about the child (cid:2) s normal sleep routine , symptoms of sleep - disordered breathing , and family history . Exclusion criteria included the presence of genetic disorders , cerebral palsy , neuromuscular disorders , and children with acute infections . This study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee for The Children (cid:2) s Hos - pital at Westmead and written parental consent was obtained for all participants . Anthropometric measures Height and weight were obtained for each child . Height was measured to the nearest 0 . 1cm using a Harpenden Stadiometer ( Holtain Ltd . , Crymych , UK ) and weight was measured in light clothing to the nearest 0 . 01 kg on digital scales . Body mass index ( BMI ; kg m ) 2 ) and z - scores were calculated from age and gender speciﬁc reference values ( Kuczmarski et al . , 2000 ) For the purposes of this study , participants with a BMI z - score > 2 were considered obese . Overnight polysomnography Polysomnograms was performed on all children referred to the Sleep Unit for evaluation . Children were studied for up to 12 h in a quiet , darkened room in the company of a parent . The following parameters were measured : four channels of electro - encephalogram , electrooculogram , submental , diaphragm , and abdominal electromyelograms . Respiratory variables included thoracic and abdominal wall movement ( inductance plethys - mography using Respitrace (cid:3) ( Non Invasive Monitoring Systems , Miami , FL , USA ) , nasal airﬂow using a pressure transducer attached to nasal prongs ( No . 1615 ; Slater Labs , Arvin , CA , USA ) and a thermister ( Compumedics , Melbourne , Australia ) , oxyhemoglobin saturation ( SpO 2 ; Ohmeda Biox , CO , USA ) , and transcutaneous carbon dioxide ( TCM3 ; Radi - ometer , Copenhagen , Denmark ) . In addition , electrocardio - gram and body position were recorded . All sleep study data were acquired on a digital data acquisition system ( Compu - medics S Series , Melbourne , Australia ) and analyzed with compumedics profusion Software . The sleep architecture was assessed using standardized techniques . Brieﬂy , respiratory events were considered signif - icant if they lasted ‡ 2 respiratory cycles ( AAP and Pediatrics , A . A . O . , 2002 ) and were accompanied with a ‡ 3 % SpO 2 desaturation and ⁄ or terminated by arousal . Obstructive ap - neas were deﬁned as the cessation ⁄ reduction of airﬂow to < 80 % of baseline with continuing or increasing eﬀort ( as measured by the Respitrace and ⁄ or diaphragm EMG ) . Hyp - opneas were deﬁned as a decrease in airﬂow ‡ 50 % of the baseline amplitude . Arousals ( spontaneous , movement , respi - ratory , and sigh ) were deﬁned as changes in ‡ 2 independent channels , with at least a 10 - s period of sleep prior to the change and a disturbance lasting for > 1 s . The primary outcome measure for sleep studies was the respiratory disturbance index ( RDI ) , deﬁned as the number of respiratory events per hour of SEM for childhood OSA and metabolic syndrome 389 (cid:2) 2007 European Sleep Research Society , J . Sleep Res . , 16 , 388 – 395 sleep time , to provide an indication of the severity of OSA . Children with an RDI ‡ 1 were considered to have OSA . Additional outcomes included in our model were the arousal indices , for spontaneous events and for those precipitated by an apnea or hypopnea ( respiratory arousals ) . Arousal indices were also deﬁned as the number ( by type ) of event per hour of sleep time . Blood samples A fasting blood sample was collected the morning following the sleep study at approximately 6 : 30 hours . Local anesthetic cream was applied to the cubital fossa and blood was drawn for measurement of insulin , glucose , lipid proﬁle , and cytokines . Metabolic markers Insulin levels were measured by a commercially available assay ( Linco Research Inc . , St Charles , MO , USA ) based on a radioimmunoassay , double antibody ⁄ PEG technique . The lowest level of insulin that can be detected by this assay is 0 . 2 l U mL ) 1 ( 1 . 4 pmol ⁄ L ) when using a 100 l L sample size with an intra - assay coeﬃcient of variability of 3 . 2 % and an inter - assay coeﬃcient of 3 . 9 % . Glucose proﬁles were measured on a Beckman CX5 high performance liquid chromatography automated analyzer ( Beckman Instruments Inc . , Fullerton , CA , USA ) . Glucose concentrations were measured using the glucose oxidase method with an analytical range of 0 . 3 – 38 . 8 mmol L ) 1 and intra - and inter - assay coeﬃcients of variability of 1 . 6 and 1 . 3 % , respectively . Plasma lipids including total cholesterol , HDL cholesterol , and triglycerides were assessed using Flex Reagent Cartridges ( Dade Behring , Newark , DE , USA ) . Inﬂammatory markers Plasma was aliquotted and stored at ) 80º until required for cytokine assays . Cytokines were quantiﬁed using a multiplex bead - based assay ( LiquiChip Human 10 - Cytokine kit ; Qiagen , Tokyo , Japan ) . Leptin was measured by a commercial available assay ( Linco Research Inc , St Charles , MO , USA ) . Cytokine assays were performed for interleukin ( IL ) - 1 b , IL - 2 , IL - 4 , IL - 6 , IL - 8 , IL - 10 , IL - 12 , granulocyte macrophage - colony stimulating factor ( GM - CSF ) , interferon ( IFN ) - c and tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) - a . All cytokine assays were completed over 2 days to minimize inter - assay variability . DATA ANALYSIS Data were analyzed using SPSS for Windows version 13 and amos 4 . 0 statistical software ( SPSS Inc . Chicago , IL , USA ) . A P - value of < 0 . 05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant . Structural equation modeling analyses were conducted in three steps . First , exploratory factor analysis , using principal axis factoring and oblique rotation , was conducted on inﬂam - matory and metabolic markers and sleep parameters . These are standard methods used in SEM to decrease the number of variables ( http : / / www . statsoft . com / textbooks / stfacan ) . Mea - sured ( observed ) and latent ( unobserved ) variables were exam - ined for co - linearity , and related variables were combined into single (cid:3) factors (cid:2) , with individual factor loadings . Two criteria were used to determine the number of factors including eigen values > 1 and the percent of variance accounted for by the factors < 70 % ( http : / / www . statsoft . com / textbooks / stfacan ) . Next , the factors were incorporated into a model using conﬁrmatory factor analysis ; the model was tested using goodness of ﬁt tests to assess the overall ﬁt of the model to the data . Various models were tested until the best ﬁtting model was obtained . Finally , the model obtained from conﬁrmatory factor analysis was incorporated into a structural equation model examining the links between BMI , sleep variables , and the cytokine and metabolic factors . RESULTS From 216 children recruited for this study , 184 children ( 69 % male ) had complete data for anthropometry , sleep studies , and all blood markers , allowing them to be included in the SEM . The mean age was 8 . 5 ± 4 . 1 years ( range 1 . 5 – 17 . 9 years ) . Forty - two percent of the children were considered obese ( BMI z - score > 2 . 00 ) . The mean AHI was 8 . 8 ± 16 . 9 h ) 1 ( range 0 – 163 . 4 ) ; 25 ( 14 % ) children had an RDI < 1 and 74 ( 40 % ) had an RDI ‡ 5 . The mean sleep eﬃciency was 79 . 7 ± 13 . 2 % .

A . Waters et al . (cid:2) 2007 European Sleep Research Society , J . Sleep Res . , 16 , 388 – 395 Structural equation modeling Exploratory factor analysis of the cytokine and metabolic marker variables produced three latent factors including two cytokine factors and one factor for the metabolic syndrome . Components of the ﬁrst cytokine factor included IL - 4 , IL - 6 , IL - 10 , and IL - 12 , GM - CSF and IFN - c . Components of the second cytokine factor included IL - 1 , IL - 2 , IL - 4 , IL - 8 , and TNF - a . Each of these factor loadings were statistically signiﬁcant ( P < 0 . 05 ) . IL - 4 and TNF - a were included in both cytokine factors , because they were signiﬁcant in both factors . Cholesterol did not load signiﬁcantly on the latent variables and was therefore modeled as an individual variable separate from inﬂammation and metabolic dysfunction in subsequent models . These factors were incorporated into a conﬁrmatory factor analysis to determine the ﬁt of this model to the data . The best ﬁtting model from conﬁrmatory factor analysis was incorpo - rated into a structural equation model examining the links between BMI z - score , sleep variables , inﬂammation , and the metabolic syndrome . The model provided good ﬁt to the data ( v 2 ⁄ df = 2 . 855 ; comparative ﬁt index = 0 . 90 , root mean squared error of approximation = 0 . 10 ) and all factor load - ings ( Table 2 ) were signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from zero ( P £ 0 . 01 ) . A simpliﬁed version of the SEM is pictured ( Fig . 1 ) . The paths represented are only those that were found to have statistically signiﬁcant path coeﬃcients ( not all of those tested ) . All analyses were controlled for age . The ﬁgure demonstrates which markers load on to their respective factors as well as the magnitude of factor loadings . We re - ran the SEM model after forcing the cytokine factors into (cid:3) biological (cid:2) ( TH2 , pro - , and anti - inﬂammatory ) rather than (cid:3) statistically derived (cid:2) clusters , but this model did not converge . This outcome suggests there is a problem with the biological model speciﬁed and for these data alternative models , such as the model derived from the exploratory factor analyses , may provide a better solution . This is further described in the discussion .

All associations shown in the ﬁgure are signiﬁcant . How - ever , for simplicity , not all signiﬁcant correlations are shown in the ﬁgure . Note : Negative coeﬃcients are expected for SpO 2 since lower oxygen saturation indicates more severe hypoxia . The negative corre - lations between (cid:3) Cytok . 1 (cid:2) and other variables may reﬂect the anti - cytokine factors in this cluster of inﬂammatory markers .

In terms of sleep variables , spontaneous arousals were predictive of the meta - bolic variable , but were not predictive of inﬂammation . From the lipids we measured , only total cholesterol was included in the model . Respiratory arousals were predictive of cholesterol but not of the metabolic variable or inﬂammation . Cholesterol , in turn , was associated with the metabolic variable . SpO 2 was predictive of cholesterol and had a relation with the metabolic variable that demonstrated a trend towards signiﬁcance ( P = 0 . 07 ) . The relation between SpO 2 and the metabolic variable was statistically signiﬁcant if cholesterol was removed from the model ( P < 0 . 05 ) . Of the cytokine factors ( Cytokines 1 and 2 ) , cytokines 1 , but not 2 , was associated with the metabolic factor in the model . Even if the path from cytokines 1 to 2 was removed from the analysis , cytokines 2 was not linked to the metabolic factor . Cytokines 1 was a signiﬁcant predictor of Cytokines 2 ( b = 0 . 53 , P < 0 . 001 , not pictured ) . DISCUSSION Using SEM in a cohort of children with and without OSA , results from our study indicate that while BMI has a major inﬂuence on metabolic abnormalities , arousal indices and cytokine markers also contribute to metabolic dysfunction . Direct associations were found between sleep parameters and metabolic dysfunction , but we found no direct associations between sleep and cytokine factors ( as markers of inﬂammation ) . Structural equation modeling Structural equation modeling is a powerful statistical tool for building and testing models . It is a hybrid technique that encompasses general linear modeling , path analysis and regression , and the major advantage is that (cid:3) latent (cid:2) ( unob - served ) variables can be incorporated into the model . How - ever , SEM does have certain limitations . To date , there is no recommended method for power analysis to calculate appro - priate sample size to test a hypothesis using this modeling technique . In general , a sample size 10 times that of the number of variables is recommended . Hence using this general rule , our study , with 184 children may be viewed as a pilot study , which needs to be conﬁrmed in larger studies . Although , after reviewing the literature , Loehlin et al . concluded that in SEM analysis that uses two to four factors ( such as ours ) ( http : / / www . utexas . edu / its / rc / tutorials / amos ) , 100 cases is suf - ﬁcient ( http : / / www . utexas . edu . its / rc / tutorials / stat / amos / ) and previous published studies have used similar sized cohorts ( Chan et al . , 2002 ) . Another limitation of SEM is that the statistical model chosen may not be the best - ﬁtting model for the data and causal associations cannot be drawn . Although diﬀerent models can be generated , the models need to be interpreted in light of the theoretical background of the topic , such that the ﬁnal model is valid both statistically and theoretically ( Joreskog and Sorbom , 1993 ) . It is important to note that results from SEM analysis may be inﬂuenced by the sample , variables , time frame and the grouping of factors used in the analysis ( Maccallum and Austin , 2000 ) . Here we highlight some of the interesting ﬁndings from the present study . Components of OSA Physiological disturbances associated with OSA include arousal and desaturation ( hypoxia ) . Our method of scoring apneas means that termination of apnea is always associated with desaturation , but not always with arousal . Because arousal from sleep is linked to dysregulation of inﬂammation , and studies in adults have shown that sleep deprivation is associated with reduced insulin responses to glucose , we made a distinction between arousal events and desaturation events ( Shamsuzzaman et al . , 2003 ; Spiegel et al . , 1999 ) . Although there is controversy about arousal deﬁnitions and their clinical signiﬁcance ( Ciftci et al . , 2004b ) , arousal is less consistently associated with the termination of apnea in children than adults ( Scholle and Zwacka , 2001 ) . Minimum oxygen saturation showed the anticipated , nega - tive correlation with metabolic markers although this may reﬂect other mechanisms for disturbed glucose metabolism or inﬂammation , including the increase in sympathetic activity associated with OSA ( Punjabi et al . , 2004 ) . In our respiratory analyses obstructive events were only marked if they termi - nated in desaturation or arousal and we acknowledge that this is a relatively conservative method of scoring respiratory events in pediatrics . Nonetheless , the association with mini - mum saturation was stronger than that for respiratory event indices . The frequency of spontaneous arousals correlated positively with lipid ( cholesterol ) levels , but negatively with metabolic dysfunction . The result is consistent with studies showing that eﬀective treatment of OSA in adults is associated with a fall in cholesterol levels ( Robinson et al . , 2004 ) . This occurred despite the previous observations that the frequency of spontaneous arousals falls with increasing severity of OSA in children , and that arousal frequency does not correlate with markers of disturbed glucose metabolism in adults ( Punjabi et al . , 2004 ; Tauman et al . , 2004 ) . Associations with metabolic dysfunction Potential mediators of the relation between OSA and meta - bolic dysfunction include direct eﬀects of hypoxemia on glucose regulation ( Oltmanns et al . , 2004 ) , elevations in sympathetic nerve activity ( Somers et al . , 1995 ) , or upregula - tion of inﬂammatory mediators ( Arter et al . , 2004 ) . Results from our study indicate three underlying factors , namely a metabolic factor and two cytokine factors . BMI z - score ( as a measure of obesity ) may mediate metabolic dysfunction and in severely obese children the prevalence of metabolic syndrome may be as high as 50 % ( Weiss et al . , 2004 ) . In our model , the metabolic factor included insulin , glucose , and leptin . We also found that OSA and BMI z - score was 392 K . A . Waters et al . (cid:2) 2007 European Sleep Research Society , J . Sleep Res . , 16 , 388 – 395 associated with leptin . Leptin , a hormone produced by adipose tissue , regulates fat mass by decreasing food intake and increasing resting energy expenditure ( Shamsuzzaman et al . , 2003 ) . Leptin binds to receptors in the hypothalamus that stimulate anorexigenic peptides , such as poopiomelanocortin and inhibit orexigenic peptides , including neuropeptide Y . Leptin levels are elevated in both obesity ( Bao et al . , 1997 ; Berenson et al . , 1997 ) and OSA ( Caro et al . , 1996 ; Ulukavak Ciftci et al . , 2005 ) , with these levels decreasing following treatment for OSA ( Chin et al . , 1999 ; IP et al . , 2000 ) . The persistence of OSA and obesity , despite high leptin levels , may represent a leptin resistant state , although the molecular basis of this is yet to be determined ( Ulukavak Ciftci et al . , 2005 ) . Associations with inﬂammatory markers It is important to recognize that the cytokine clustering used in this model was based on statistical compatibility , not current understanding of biological functions . In that context , whereas sleep variables are associated with metabolic dysfunction in children , our model suggests that the main connection between sleep apnea and inﬂammation is through the inﬂuence of BMI . Obesity ( increasing BMI ) was associated with worsening of metabolic markers but with reduced levels of the cytokine markers . Sleep variables were not related to the cytokine factors . An alternative path showed that changes in metabolic function led to downstream changes in inﬂammatory markers . The two cytokine factors uncovered in the analysis suggest that in general the pro - inﬂammatory cytokines and the anti - inﬂammatory cytokines tended to load on to separate factors although there was some overlap . The cytokine 1 factor including anti - inﬂammatory cytokines IFN - c , IL - 10 , and IL - 12 was negatively related to BMI z - score . This may suggest that increasing BMI inhibits the anti - inﬂammatory cytokines with upregulation of some pro - inﬂammatory cytokines . Indeed , obesity in itself may be a low - grade inﬂammatory state . Adipose tissue can also have a substantial impact on systemic glucose homeostasis , insulin resistance , and vascular disorders through altered production and release of adipokin - es , such as leptin . Some cytokines are derived from adipocytes as well as other tissues ( IL - 6 , IL - 8 ) . The mechanism for the disturbances in inﬂammatory mediators may relate to oxida - tive stress ( Furukawa et al . , 2004 ) . It has been suggested that the intermittent hypoxemia associated with OSA may also underlie inﬂammation by triggering the formation of reactive oxygen species ( Dyugovs - kaya et al . , 2002 ; Lavie , 2003 ) and in turn trigger the release of pro - inﬂammatory cytokines that aﬀect metabolism ( Pickup and Crook , 1998 ; Stumvoll and Haring , 2001 ) . In the present study , where our measure of hypoxia was the SpO 2 nadir , we did not ﬁnd an association between hypoxia and either of the cytokine factors . It remains possible that alternative measures of hypoxia , such as percentage of time with saturation levels below a given threshold , would yield an association with the cytokine factors . Several cytokines ( e . g . , IL - 6 , IL - 8 , TNF - a ) are also derived from adipocytes , and production of these cytokines is increased in obesity , particularly TNF - a and IL - 6 ( Vgontzas et al . , 1997 ) . Vgontzas et al . ( 2003 ) have shown that IL - 6 , TNF - a , leptin , and insulin levels are elevated in adult sleep apnea independent of obesity . In addition , visceral fat was the primary parameter linked with sleep apnea and blockade of TNF - a was associated with reduced sleepiness ( Vgontzas et al . , 2005 ) . We found that BMI z - score was related to one of the cytokine factors but in our models the relations between obesity ( BMI ) and cytokine factors were complex . There was a negative association between BMI and cytokine 1 ( which included a number of anti - inﬂammatory cytokines ) , although BMI showed a positive relation to the metabolic factor which was in turn related to the second cytokine factor . Several recent studies have shown that IL - 6 , and TNF - a are elevated in adults with OSA ( Ciftci et al . , 2004a ) . We found a positive association between BMI and the cytokine factor included TNF - a , but a negative correlation between BMI and the cytokine factor that included IL - 6 . Ciftci et al . , ( 2004a ) have shown that IL - 6 and TNF - a correlated with RDI but not with BMI , which suggests that the link between cardiovascular morbidity and OSA may be explained by the coexistence of other cardiovascular risk factors ( such as IL6 and TNF - a ) . CONCLUSION The markers of metabolic dysfunction we used , such as obesity , insulin resistance , hypertension , and dyslipidemia are known to be pathological risk markers for cardiovascular disease in young adults . The analysis that we presented here is novel in children . Exploration of associations between sleep apnea , metabolic dysfunction , and inﬂammation in children provided further support for the existence of a link between obesity and OSA in children , which is likely to increase the risk for future atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease ( Vgontzas et al . , 2003 ) . The results also support the hypoth - esis that diﬀerent components of OSA may contribute to diﬀerent elements of metabolic dysfunction . SEM provides useful exploration of complex associations in physiological systems .
