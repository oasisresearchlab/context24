Computed Atlas of Surface Topography of proteins ( CASTp ) is a webserver that provides online services for lo - cating , delineating , and measuring these geometric and topological properties of protein structures . It has been widely used since its inception in 2003 . In this article , we present the latest version of the webserver , CASTp 3 . 0 . CASTp 3 . 0 continues to provide reliable and comprehensive identiﬁcations and quantiﬁcations of protein topography . In addition , it now provides : 1 ) imprints of the negative vol - umes of pockets , cavities and channels , 2 ) topographic features of biological assemblies in the Protein Data Bank , 3 ) improved visualization of protein structures and pockets , and 4 ) more intuitive struc - tural and annotated information , including information of secondary structure , functional sites , vari - ant sites , and other annotations of protein residues . The CASTp 3 . 0 webserver is freely accessible at http : / / sts . bioe . uic . edu / castp / 1 Introduction Protein structures are complex and are sculpted with numerous surface pockets , internal cavities , and cross channels . These topographic features provide structural basis and microenvironments for proteins to carry out their functions such as ligand binding , DNA interaction , and enzymatic activity . Identiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation of these topographic features of proteins are therefore of fundamental importance for under - standing the structure - function relationship of proteins [ 1 ] , in engineering proteins for desired properties [ 2 ] , and in developing therapeutics against protein targets [ 3 ] . 2 The CASTp server The CASTp server aims to provide comprehensive and detailed quantitative characterization of topographic features of proteins [ 4 , 5 ] . Since its release 15 years ago , the CASTp server has ∼ 45 , 000 visits and fulﬁlls ∗ These authors contributed equally to this work . † To whom correspondence should be addressed .

It has been proven to be a useful tool for a wide range of studies , including investigations of signaling receptors [ 1 ] , discoveries of cancer therapeutics [ 6 ] , understanding of mechanism of drug actions [ 7 ] , studies of immune disorder diseases [ 8 ] , analysis of protein - nanoparticle interactions [ 9 ] , inference of protein functions [ 10 ] , and development of high - throughput computational tools [ 11 , 12 ] . To provide additional useful information and to deliver improved user experience , we introduce here an updated server called CASTp 3 . 0 . All important features of the previous versions of the server are retained , including detecting and characterizing cavities , pockets , and channels of protein structures ( Figure 1 ) . In addition , we have substantially extended its functions by providing precomputed topographic features of biological assemblies in the PDB database , as well as imprints of negative volumes of these topographic features . Furthermore , the user interface has been redesigned so it is more intuitive and informative . 2 . 1 New features of CASTp 3 . 0 Precomputed results for biological assemblies . The atomic coordinates of a PDB entry in the Protein Data Bank describe an asymmetric unit , which is the minimum structure that can produce the unit cell of the crystal through duplication and crystal symmetry operations . For many PDB entries , the asymmetric unit diﬀers from the biological assembly , which is the unit that has either been shown or is thought to be the functional form of the protein . This diﬀerence can be signiﬁcant , and can make the computation results of a PDB entry biologically irrelevant . For example , PDB entry 2iwv of the outer membrane porin OmpG contains four units as deposited . Its direct computation leads to the detection of a giant artiﬁcial pocket ( Figure 2A ) , which obscures the actual functional channel ( Figure 2B ) . To uncover topographic features that are biologically most relevant , the new CASTp server precomputes topographic features for the biological assemblies of PDB entries . Users now are able to navigate eﬀortlessly between results of the asymmetric unit and results of biological assemblies of a PDB entry . Imprints of negative volumes of topographic features . In the previous versions of CASTp servers , topological features , such as cavities , pockets , and pockets , were shown only through the representation of surface atoms participating in their formation . The new CASTp server has added solid imprints of the negative volumes as a visualization option , which can give users direct and intuitive understanding of these 2 Figure 2 : When the asymmetric unit diﬀers from the biological assembly . ( A ) Asymmetric unit in the PDB entry of 2iwv and the artiﬁcial giant pocket . ( B ) Biological structure of 2iwv ( biological assembly 1 ) and its channel detected by the CASTp server . important structural features of proteins [ 13 , 14 ] . Improved user interface . The visualization techniques employed in previous versions of CASTp servers over 12 - year ago are out - of - date and are incompatible with the modern browsers . The new CASTp server now uses 3Dmol . js [ 15 ] for structural visualization , which allows users to view , to interact with protein structures , and to examine computation results in modern desktop or mobile web browsers such as Chrome and Firefox . Users can choose the representation style of the atoms that form each topographic feature . The imprint of these features can also be shown with user - selected colors ( Figure 3A ) . An intuitive sequence panel is also presented to users with secondary structures color - coded , where residues in user - selected pockets are highlighted . Residues annotated from UniProt [ 16 ] are also labeled . Both information on topographic feature - forming atoms and UniProt annotations are conveniently displayed when the cursor hovers over the relevant residues . The annotations are also summarized in the annotation panel ( Figure 3B ) . In addition , both the sequence panel and the annotation panel are linked to the structure viewer , so users can conveniently click on one residue on the sequence map to have the structure viewer zoomed into that speciﬁc residue of interest . Furthermore , a ﬂoating structure viewer has been added ( Figure 3B ) . When a user inspects information in the sequence panel or the annotation panel , the structure viewer will automatically follow the webpage scrolling of the user , which saves the user from unnecessary and unproductive eﬀorts in scrolling up and down . 3 Input and output 3 . 1 Input The CASTp server takes protein structures in the PDB format and a probe radius as input for topographic computation . Through the intuitive interface , users can either search for precomputed results using a four - letter PDB ID , or submit their own protein structures to request customized computation . For precomputed results , a default probe radius of 1 . 4 ˚A is used , which is the standard value for computing solvent accessible surface area . For customized computation request , users can specify any probe radius desired . 3 Figure 3 : The main user interface of the CASTp server . ( A ) the pocket panel . ( B ) the sequence and annotaion panels . 4 3 . 2 Output The CASTp server identiﬁes all surface pockets , interior cavities and cross channels in a protein structure , and provides detailed delineation of all atoms participating in their formation . It also measures their exact volumes and areas , as well as sizes of the mouth openings if exist . These metrics are calculated analytically , using both the solvent accessible surface model ( Richards’ surface ) [ 17 ] and the molecular surface model ( Connolly’s surface ) [ 18 ] . In addition , the CASTp server also provides imprints of topographic features . These results can be directly downloaded from CASTp server , which can be visualized using either the UCSF Chimera [ 19 ] or our PyMOL plugin , CASTpyMOL . 3 . 3 Case study Figure 3 illustrates the ATP binding pocket on the cyclin - dependent kinase 2 ( CDK2 , PDB ID 2xmy ) that is automatically identiﬁed by the CASTp server . CDK2 is an important enzyme that regulates cell cycle with other CDKs . Many functionally important residues are located in this pockets , including three residues Lys33 , Asp86 , and Asp145 in the ATP binding site , one residue Asp127 in the catalytic site , two residues Asn132 and Asp145 in Mg binding sites , and one residue Lys89 in the binding site that interacts with CDK7 , another important cell - cycle - controlling enzyme . Due to the importance of this pocket , it has been widely studied as a target site for antitumor agents [ 6 ] . In the CASTp server , users can choose diﬀerent representation of pockets . For example , the pocket can be displayed as surface ( Figure 1 ) . In Figure 3 , the imprint of the pocket is shown in red , and the atoms forming the pocket are shown as sticks . Volume and area measures , and the list of all atoms participating in the pocket formation are also given ( Figure 3A ) . Users can view the pocket from the sequence panel . Important annotations can also be found easily in either the sequence panel or the annotation panel ( Figure 3B ) . Additional examples illustrating how CASTp computations have been used can be found in the literature [ 11 , 10 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 ] . 4 Discussion This paper describes signiﬁcant updates to the CASTp server . We believe these updates with additional information and improved user experience will continue to facilitate studies of protein structures and func - tions . 5 Materials and methods The CASTp server uses the alpha shape method [ 26 ] developed in computational geometry to identify topographic features , to measure area and volume , and to compute imprint [ 27 , 28 , 13 , 14 ] . The secondary structures are calculated using DSSP [ 29 ] . Residue annotations of proteins are obtained from UniProt database [ 16 ] and mapped to PDB structures with residue - level information from the SIFTS database [ 30 ] . 6 Acknowledgements This work was supported by NIH grant R01CA204962 . 5 6 . 0 . 1 Conﬂict of interest statement .
