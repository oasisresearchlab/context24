At cell - cell junctions , ternary E - cadherin / β - catenin / αE - catenin complexes sense and transmit mechanical load by binding to F - actin . The interaction with F - actin , described as a two - state catch bond , is weak in solution but is strengthened by applied force due to force - dependent transitions between weak and strong actin - binding states . Here , we provide direct evidence from optical trapping experiments that the catch bond property principally resides in the αE - catenin actin - binding domain ( ABD ) . Consistent with our previously proposed model , deletion of the first helix of the five - helix ABD bundle enables stable interactions with F - actin under minimal load that are well - described by a single - state slip bond , even when αE - catenin is complexed with β - catenin and E - cadherin . Our data argue for a conserved catch bond mechanism for adhesion proteins with structurally similar ABDs . We also demonstrate that a stably bound ABD strengthens load - dependent binding interactions between a neighboring complex and F - actin , but the presence of the other αE - catenin domains weakens this effect . These results provide mechanistic insight to the cooperative binding of the cadherin - catenin complex to F - actin , which regulate dynamic cytoskeletal linkages in epithelial tissues . 3 Introduction The physical integrity and long - range organization of epithelial tissues are mediated in large part by dynamic linkages between intercellular adhesion complexes and the actomyosin cytoskeleton . Intercellular adhesions actively remodel in response to both external and cytoskeletally generated mechanical forces , both to reinforce tissues against forces that might otherwise threaten tissue integrity , and to drive cell - cell rearrangements that underlie embryonic morphogenesis and wound healing ( Charras and Yap , 2018 ; Ladoux and Mège , 2017 ) . Mechanotransduction at cell - cell adhesions likewise plays a central role in maintaining tissue homeostasis , and its dysregulation is associated with diseases such as metastatic cancer ( Ding et al . , 2010 ; Vasioukhin , 2012 ) . Despite this physiological importance , the molecular mechanisms by which intercellular adhesions sense and respond to mechanical load remain incompletely understood . Adherens junctions are essential intracellular adhesion sites in epithelial tissues . In these junctions , the extracellular domain of E - cadherin forms contacts between neighboring cells , and the intracellular domain binds β - catenin . β - Catenin binds to αE - catenin , which binds directly to F - actin ( Desai et al . , 2013 ; Meng and Takeichi , 2009 ; Rimm et al . , 1995 ; Shapiro and Weis , 2009 ) ( Figure 1A ) . The ternary E - cadherin / β - catenin / αE - catenin complex forms weak , transient interactions with F - actin in the absence of external load ( Drees et al . , 2005 ; Miller et al . , 2013 ; Yamada et al . , 2005 ) . However , single - molecule force measurements revealed that mechanical force strengthens binding interactions between the ternary cadherin - catenin complex and F - actin ( Buckley et al . , 2014 ) . This property , known as a catch bond , is thought to help reinforce intercellular adhesion under tension . Because the observed distribution of bond survival lifetimes between the cadherin - catenin complex and F - actin is biexponential , this interaction is best described by a two - state catch bond model defined by two distinct actin - bound states , weak and strong ( Buckley et al . , 2014 ) . In this model , force enhances the transition from the weak to strong state , which results in longer binding lifetimes at higher load . Transitions between bound states are thought to arise from structural rearrangements in αE - catenin , which is allosterically modulated by binding partners and by mechanical load ( le Duc et al . , 2010 ; Maki et al . , 2016 ; Mei et al . , 2020 ; Terekhova et al . , 2019 ; Xu et al . , 2020 ; Yonemura et al . , 2010 ) . The catch bond interaction is directional , such that force applied towards the pointed ( - ) end of the polar actin filament results in longer - lived bonds than when force is applied towards the barbed ( + ) end ( Arbore et al . , 2022 ; Bax et al . , 2022 ) . αE - catenin consists of an N - terminal ( N ) β - catenin binding - domain , a middle ( M ) domain , and a flexible linker to a C - terminal actin - binding domain ( ABD ) ( Pokutta et al . , 2014 ; Pokutta and Weis , 2000 ) ( Figure 1B ) . Several lines of evidence suggest conformational changes within the αE - catenin ABD , a five - helix bundle ( H1 - H5 ) with a short N - terminal helix ( H0 ) , underlie catch bond formation ( Ishiyama et al . , 2018 , 2013 ; Rangarajan and Izard , 2013 ) . Two recent structural studies ( Mei et al . , 2020 ; Xu et al . , 2020 ) showed that whereas the structure of F - actin is essentially unchanged by complex formation , the ABD N - terminus through the last turn of H1 becomes disordered and helices H2 - H5 repack , and the C - terminal peptide ( CTE , aa 844 - 906 ) that follows H5 becomes partially ordered and interacts with actin ( Figure 2A ) . Consistent with the reported structures , we showed that removal of H0 and H1 produced 18x stronger binding of the ABD to F - actin in solution ( Xu et al . , 2020 ) . Based on these structural and biochemical findings , we proposed that the observed four - helix , actin - bound ABD conformation represents the strong F - actin bound state ( Figure 2B ) . Here , we test the structural model for catch bond formation with optical trapping measurements , which demonstrate that H0 and H1 of the αE - catenin ABD are required to confer directional catch bond behavior between the ternary cadherin - catenin complex and F - actin . Our findings are consistent with the structural model in which H0 and H1 reversibly undock from the remainder of the ABD to enable a transition between weak and strong actin - binding states . We further show that although the catch bond interaction is principally attributed to conformational changes in the ABD , the N and M domains of αE - catenin also regulate force sensitive binding . 4 Results αE - catenin ABD and full - length monomer forms a catch bond with F - actin Previous investigations of the force - dependent binding of αE - catenin to F - actin have employed either the ternary E - cadherin / β - catenin / αE - catenin complex ( Bax et al . , 2022 ; Buckley et al . , 2014 ) , a binary β - catenin / αE - catenin complex , or αE - catenin alone ( Arbore et al . , 2022 ) . The proposed molecular mechanism of the catch bond between αE - catenin and F - actin , however , is based upon structural data of the isolated and actin - bound αE - catenin ABD ( Xu et al . , 2020 ) . To confirm that the catch bond behavior is truly associated with the ABD itself , we measured binding interactions between F - actin and the wild - type ABD ( residues 666 - 906 ) under load with a constant force assay in an optical trap , and compared our results to prior data ( Bax et al . , 2022 ) on the ternary complex obtained with the same instrument . In the optical trap experiments , a taut actin filament is suspended between two trapped beads and positioned over αE - catenin ABD immobilized on microspheres that are attached to a coverslip surface ( Figure 3A ) . To exert load on the ABD , the stage is oscillated in a square wave parallel to the long axis of the filament . When a binding event occurs , the trapped beads are displaced from their equilibrium positions , resulting in a restoring force that can be measured with pN and ms resolutions . Stage motion pauses when bead displacement is detected , thereby applying a constant load to the bond between ABD molecules and F - actin ( Figure 3B ) . As with wild - type ternary complex ( Bax et al . , 2022 ; Buckley et al . , 2014 ) , force on the beads commonly decreased in several discrete steps ( ‘multi - step’ ) , with each step corresponding to the release of a load - bearing molecule from the filament ( Figure 3 - figure supplement 1 ) . The plateau of the final detachment step corresponds to the binding lifetime for the last remaining load - bearing molecule . Following full detachment , stage oscillation begins again , allowing us to collect multiple binding events from the same set of molecules . The two - state catch bond model is described by the interconversion between a strongly bound state , a weakly - bound state , and the unbound state ( Figure 2B ) . The force - dependent interconversion rate between these states is given by the Bell - Evans model ( Bell , 1978 ; Evans and Ritchie , 1997 ) : k i→j ! F " " ⃗ $ = k i→j0 e Fx i→j / k b T , where k i→j0 is the transition rate under no load , F " " ⃗ is the force vector , and x i→j is the distance between the initial state , i , with the transition state between i and j projected along F " " ⃗ . We used maximum likelihood estimation to determine k i→j0 and x i→j parameters from observed binding lifetimes corresponding to the measured force . All binding lifetimes included in the analysis are derived from the final detachment plateau from multi - step data . Our data revealed that the αE - catenin ABD forms a catch bond with F - actin , in which the lifetime of binding interactions increased with the application of mechanical force ( Figure 3C , Table 1 ) . The observation that the ABD forms a two - state catch bond to F - actin supports the structural model that the five - helix and four - helix conformation represents the weak and strong bound states , respectively . Previous modeling done by superimposing crystal structures of the isolated ABD on the actin - bound ABD structure showed few clashes with actin , suggesting that a similar five - helix structure may form a subset of interactions observed in the stably bound conformation ( Xu et al . , 2020 ) . To quantify the possible differences in F - actin contacts between the proposed weak and strong state structures , we compared interactions between energy - minimized actin - bound ABD models and F - actin ( Figure 3 - figure supplement 2 , Table S1 ) . Energy minimization of the five - helix , ABD models resulted in approximately 0 . 5 Å RMSD compared to the undocked minimized structure , with the loop connecting H4 and H5 slightly repositioned to relieve minor clashes . The actin - bound four - helix ABD structure had a higher surface contact area than all three models of the docked ABD structures analyzed ( Table S1 ) , in part due to the CTE , which forms numerous interactions with actin in the bound structure ( pdb 6UPV ) but is otherwise disordered , as well as several residues in the extended H4 present in the actin - bound structure ( Mei et al . , 2020 ; Xu et al . , 2020 ) . Other residues in H4 and H5 observed to interact with actin in the actin - bound structure adopt similar positions in the five - helix bundle conformations . These observations are consistent 5 with the proposal that a five - helix conformation similar to that of the isolated ABD can weakly interact with actin ( Xu et al . , 2020 ) . H0 and H1 regulate the catch bond interaction between cadherin - catenin complexes and F - actin To examine whether conformational changes in H0 and H1 of the ABD suffice to confer catch bond behavior to the interaction between the ternary cadherin - catenin complex and F - actin , we expressed and purified αE - cateninΔH1 , in which residues corresponding to ABD H0 and most of helix H1 ( residues 666 - 696 ) are deleted from the full - length protein ( Figure 4 ) . H2 - H5 of the ABD is connected to αE - catenin N and M domains by the endogenous flexible linker , residues 633 - 665 , consistent with the observation that H0 and H1 are disordered when the ABD is bound to F - actin ( Figure 2 ) . The structural hypothesis that undocking of H0 and H1 in the ABD is required to switch from the weak to strong - binding state predicts that αE - cateninΔH1 occupies a constitutively strong - binding state ( Xu et al . , 2020 ) . To test this hypothesis directly , we performed optical trapping experiments to compare the force - dependent F - actin binding lifetimes of the E - cadherin / β - catenin / αE - cateninΔH1 complex ( ternaryΔH1 ) with those of the wild - type ternary complex . Here , αE - cateninΔH1 was assembled in a complex with full - length β - catenin and E - cadherin cytoplasmic domain tethered to the surface of the coverslip ( Figure 4A ) . The same concentration of proteins used in the experiments with the wild - type complex caused all actin filaments in the flow cell chamber to absorb to the coverslip surface , so the ternaryΔH1 complex data were collected at a lower concentration . We note that the distribution in number of steps observed in binding events is comparable between ternary wild - type and ternaryΔH1 complex data sets ( Figure 3 – figure supplement 1 ) . Two different optical trapping assays were employed to study the force - dependent binding of ternaryΔH1 complexes to F - actin . First , we used the constant - force assay described above to compare binding lifetimes for the ternary complexes assembled with wild - type αE - catenin and αE - cateninΔH1 ( Figure 4B ) . Binding times for the wild - type ternary complex peak at ~ 6 pN , indicative of a catch bond ( Figure 5A ) . In contrast , for αE - cateninΔH1 , average binding times were highest at the lowest forces assayed and decreased with increasing load ( Figure 5B ) . This latter observation is consistent with a simple Bell - Evans slip bond , in which load accelerates detachment from a single bound state . Because the constant - force assay most frequently measured interactions between 4 and 8 pN , we employed a low - force assay in which the stage is moved sinusoidally at a low amplitude to measure binding under minimal load ( Huang et al . , 2017 ) ( Figure 4C ) . When a binding interaction occurs , the oscillation of the stage is transferred to the trapped beads , resulting in a detectable increase in its positional variance . The time - averaged force experienced by the optically trapped beads depends on the point at which binding occurs in the oscillation cycle , resulting in a distribution of forces between 0 and ~ 2 . 5 pN . Relative to the constant - force assay , measurements in the low - force assay may result in an overestimation of single - molecule binding lifetimes due to the difficulty of resolving rupture events of multiple bound complexes . However , we found that the survival probability distribution from low - force assay measurements was not statistically different from that of constant - force measurements between 0 and 2 . 5 pN ( Figure 4 – figure supplement 1 ) . Strikingly , the mean F - actin binding lifetime for the ternaryΔH1 complex measured in the low - force assay is 2 . 4 s ( N = 145 , 95 % CI = 1 . 9 – 3 . 0 s ) , 39 times longer than that of the wild - type complex ( 0 . 062 s ; N = 90 , 95 % CI = 0 . 036 - 0 . 095 s ) . We used maximum likelihood estimation to obtain k U→B 0 and x U→B single - state Bell - Evans slip bond model parameters , where U and B are the unbound and bound states , from the ternaryΔH1 force - lifetime data ( Figure 5C ) . Because the comparison of survival lifetime distributions indicates that the data from low - force assay measurements likely represent single - bond interactions , they were included in our analysis so that binding observations were sampled more evenly across the 0 - 8 pN range . Parameters k U→B0 and x U→B estimated for the ternaryΔH1 single - state slip bond model are consistent with strong - to - unbound 6 parameters k 2 → 0 0 and x 2 → 0 estimated for the wild - type two - state catch bond model ( Table 2 ) . We also tested a model in which ternaryΔH1 complexes dissociate from two distinct bound states , B 1 and B 2 , but goodness - of - fit assessed using both the Akaike information criterion ( AIC ) ( Akaike , 1974 ) and Bayesian information criterion ( BIC ) ( Schwarz , 1978 ) showed that the single - state slip bond model better represented the data ( Figure 5 – figure supplement 1 , Table S2 ) . Thus , our analysis indicates that the deletion of H0 and H1 of the αE - catenin ABD eliminates the weak state conformation of the cadherin - catenin complex when bound to F - actin . The observed binding lifetime distributions lend additional support to the model that the four - helix ABD bundle observed in the cryo - EM structures represents the strong F - actin binding state . In the wild - type dataset , bond survival probabilities derived from constant - force measurements for each 2 pN force bin show biphasic distributions ( Figure 5 – figure supplement 2 , Table S3 ) , consistent with the two - state catch bond model ( Barsegov and Thirumalai , 2005 ; Thomas et al . , 2006 ) . In contrast , the distribution of survival probabilities for ternaryΔH1 complexes bound to F - actin appear monophasic below 6 pN , which likely indicates the presence of a single state in this force regime ( Figure 5 – figure supplement 2 , Table S3 ) . We noted no statistically distinguishable difference between ternaryΔH1 and wild - type for survival likelihood distributions above 6 pN ( Table S4 ) , consistent with the idea that with wild - type complex predominantly occupies the strongly bound state at these forces . The wild - type cadherin - catenin complex forms a directional catch bond with F - actin , where a higher binding frequency and larger extent of strong - state stabilization encoded by x i→j is observed when force is applied towards the pointed ( - ) end of actin filament ( Bax et al . , 2022 ) . In previous work , we hypothesized that the orientation of H1 could impart directionality : H1 would be pulled away from the H2 - H5 bundle more readily when force was directed towards the ( - ) end of F - actin but would be relatively more aligned with purported weak state when force was directed towards the barbed ( + ) end ( Xu et al . , 2020 ) ( Figure 5 – figure supplement 3 ) . Likewise , reassociation of H1 with the rest of the ABD bundle would be less likely when subjected to ( - ) end directed force . To examine the maximum possible directional asymmetry present in the ternaryΔH1 complex dataset , we tabulated events for each actin filament as corresponding to either F > 0 or F < 0 in the reference frame of the optical trap , and assigned the inferred barbed ( + ) end to the group with the shorter mean lifetime . We then compared this upper bound on directionality for ternaryΔH1 with the assigned directionality of the wild - type ternary complex ( Bax et al . , 2022 ) . For the ternary wild - type complex , the ratio of mean lifetimes between the implied ( - ) end vs ( + ) end is 3 . 78 ( 95 % CI : 2 . 74 - 5 . 31 ) , but 1 . 69 ( 95 % CI : 1 . 38 - 2 . 09 ) for the ternaryΔH1 complex . Furthermore , the ratio of the number of binding events observed when force is oriented toward the implied ( - ) vs . ( + ) end is 1 . 90 for the ternary wild - type complexes , but 1 . 13 for the ternaryΔH1 complex . These differences in lifetimes and numbers of observed events indicate that directionality is reduced in the ternaryΔH1 complex , consistent with the idea that the directional interaction between cadherin - catenin complexes and F - actin is largely attributable to the effect of force on the association / dissociation of H0 and H1 . αE - catenin N and M domains allosterically regulate F - actin interactions Binding of b - catenin to the a E - catenin N domain weakens the affinity of a E - catenin for F - actin ( Drees et al . , 2005 ; Miller et al . , 2013 ; Pokutta et al . , 2014 ; Yamada et al . , 2005 ) , and crosstalk between the ABD and the remainder of αE - catenin was detected in cysteine labeling experiments ( Terekhova et al . , 2019 ) . These observations indicate that allosteric coupling of the αE - catenin N , M and ABD domains may affect actin binding behavior . To assess whether such allostery affects the binding interactions with F - actin under force , we computed lifetime ratios between the ABD , full - length αE - catenin monomer , and the ternary complex over a 4 pN sliding window force bin across 0 - 13 pN from our trap measurements . Strikingly , the ABD interaction with F - actin is 4 - fold longer than that of the ternary complex across all applied forces ( mean LR = 4 . 28 , 90 % CI = 2 . 55 - 6 . 67 ) , indicating that the N and M domains effectively destabilize actin binding ( Figure 3 – figure supplement 3A - D ) . The actin binding lifetimes of monomeric αE - catenin ( Figure 3 – figure supplement 3E - H , Table 1 ) were comparable to those of the ternary complex 7 ( mean LR = 1 . 34 , 90 % CI = 0 . 77 - 2 . 20 ) , demonstrating that β - catenin and the E - cadherin cytoplasmic domain do not impart the observed inhibitory contributions under load . In the ternary complex experiments , multi - step events were still detected at the minimal concentration ( 5 nM ) required to produce any binding events in the constant - force assay ( Buckley et al . , 2014 ) , indicating that cadherin - catenin complexes preferentially bind actin when in the vicinity of other complexes . To simulate conditions in which stably bound untethered complexes are bound to nearby sites on actin , 100 nM ABD was added to the assay buffer ; this produced many detectable events with one apparent detachment ( ‘single - step’ ) even when the ternary complex was assembled at a concentration ( 1 nM ) below the observable threshold ( Buckley et al . , 2014 ) . Strikingly , the addition of soluble ABD also increased total binding lifetimes between actin and ternary complexes by approximately 4 - fold , congruent with our findings that the last - step binding lifetime between F - actin and ABD is 4 - fold longer than that of the ternary complex . Given that cooperative interactions between neighboring ABDs enhance binding lifetimes ( Buckley et al . , 2014 ) , we hypothesized that the presence of a stably bound neighbor might strengthen binding interactions of a given complex and F - actin . Previous data indicate that one cadherin - catenin complex experiences most of the applied load while several other neighboring “bystanders” transiently bind and unbind ( Bax et al . , 2022 ) ( Figure 3A ) . Thus , binding events that yield single - step observations likely reflect a load - bearing complex that is proximal to neighboring complexes that interact only transiently with actin . In contrast , the final load - bearing complex in a multi - step binding event is necessarily proximal to one or more complexes positioned such that they could form stable , force - bearing interactions with actin , implying an opportunity for cooperative binding interactions that could , in principle , influence binding lifetimes . To determine whether neighboring protein complexes influenced F - actin binding , we compared the lifetime ratios ( LR ) for the last step of multi - step events versus single - step events across 0 - 13 pN with a 4 pN sliding window . Binding lifetimes from multi - step data are longer than single - step data for the ABD ( mean LR = 3 . 54 , 90 % CI = 1 . 69 - 9 . 83 ) and αE - catenin monomer ( mean LR = 3 . 04 , 90 % CI = 1 . 46 - 7 . 73 ) ( Figure 6A , Figure 6 – figure supplement 1A ) . These LR values are consistent with differences in two - state catch bond fits derived from single - vs . multi - step binding events ( Figure 3 – figure supplement 3 , Table S5 ) . In contrast , differences in binding lifetimes between single - step and multi - step data for the ternary complex ( mean LR = 1 . 11 , 90 % CI = 0 . 78 - 1 . 67 ) and ternaryΔH1 complex ( mean LR = 1 . 69 , 90 % CI = 1 . 34 - 2 . 15 ) were less pronounced ( Figure 6B , Figure supplement 6 – figure supplement 1B ) . These observations suggest that force - induced proximal bystanders may allow the ABD to adopt conformations with more stable actin - binding characteristics ( Figure 6C ) , but that interactions directly or indirectly involving β - catenin inhibit cooperative binding interactions between neighboring complexes ( Figure 6D ; see Discussion ) . Discussion We previously proposed a molecular mechanism ( Xu et al . , 2020 ) for the catch bond between actin and the cadherin catenin complex , wherein force promotes the dissociation of H0 and H1 from H2 - H5 in the αE - catenin ABD , which allows the resulting four - helix H2 - H5 bundle to rearrange and stably bind the actin filament with directional preference . Here , we provide direct experimental evidence from single - molecule optical trapping experiments that the catch bond interaction stems primarily from these conformational changes in the αE - catenin ABD ( Figure 3 ) . Additionally , our results show that in the absence of H0 and H1 , the ternary cadherin - catenin complex , which otherwise transiently binds with F - actin in the absence of applied force , forms stable interactions ( Figure 5 ) . Furthermore , ternaryΔH1 binding interactions appear to be less affected by the direction of force application with respect to the actin filament when compared to wildtype . The ternaryΔH1 data can be described by a single - state slip bond with kinetic parameters consistent with those of the two - state catch bond model for the strong to unbound transition ( Figure 5 ) . 8 A previous study proposed that removal of H0 ( residues 670 - 673 ) enables stable F - actin binding by the αE - catenin ABD ( Ishiyama et al . , 2018 ) . However , our biochemical and structural data demonstrated that removal of only H0 is unlikely to completely shift the conformational equilibrium of the ABD to the strong - binding state with the rearranged H2 - H5 bundle ( Xu et al . , 2020 ) . Nonetheless , epithelial monolayers formed by cells expressing αE - cateninΔH0 displayed more resistance to mechanical perturbation compared to wild - type which , along with our in - solution measurements showing that deletion of H0 in the ABD moderately increased F - actin affinity , suggests that this may represent an intermediate to the strong state ( Xu et al . , 2020 ) . Further studies will be required to determine the pathway by which H0 and H1 dissociate from the four - helix bundle and H2 - H5 rearrange . The molecular mechanism for the two - state catch bond described in this study may be conserved across several cell adhesion proteins . The five - helix bundle ABD of vinculin , an αE - catenin paralog that is a component of both integrin - and cadherin - based adhesions , also forms a two - state catch bond to F - actin ( Huang et al . , 2017 ) . Although the vinculin ABD has no H0 and a shorter H1 compared to the αE - catenin ABD , cryoEM studies showed that , like αE - catenin , H1 is displaced from the five - helix bundle when bound to F - actin ( Kim et al . , 2016 ; Mei et al . , 2020 ) . Similarly , the C - terminal ABD of talin , which links integrins to the cytoskeleton in focal adhesions , forms an asymmetrical catch bond with F - actin ( Owen et al . , 2022 ) . The talin ABD is a member of the THATCH family of actin - binding proteins , which consist of a five - helix bundle with an H1 that negatively regulates F - actin binding in solution - based assays ( Brett et al . , 2006 ; Gingras et al . , 2008 ; Senetar et al . , 2004 ) . Although the THATCH H1 packs against a different side of the H2 - H5 bundle compared to the a - catenin / vinculin ABD ( Brett et al . , 2006 ) , we speculate that the N - terminal helix release and the transition from a five to four helix bundle may be a mechanistically conserved feature that confers catch bonding to these ABDs . The αE - catenin ABD displays cooperative binding with actin , wherein a stably bound ABD enhances the binding stability of a proximal complex ( Figure 6 ) . This cooperativity may stem from rearrangements in H2 - H5 and / or the CTE of the ABD . The CTE is largely disordered in the absence of actin , but in the actin - bound structure , V870 of the CTE packs against the C - terminal portion of the H4 extension in a neighboring ABD . Deletion of CTE residues 869 - 871 , which removes the interaction of V870 with the neighboring ABD , resulted in no detectable actin binding in solution ( Xu et al . , 2020 ) , suggesting that interactions between neighboring complexes are required to enter a non - transient actin - binding conformation . Cooperative binding was also observed in single - molecule optical trap assays ( Arbore et al . , 2022 ; Buckley et al . , 2014 ) . In particular , the addition of soluble ABD enhanced the binding lifetimes of surface - bound cadherin - catenin complexes approximately four - fold ( Buckley et al . , 2014 ) . Thus , interactions between neighboring complexes on F - actin can be inferred to be important for stable F - actin binding either with or without applied load . Importantly , it is probable that interactions between actin - bound neighbors are different for the ternary complex than for the isolated ABD . Binding to β - catenin dramatically weakens F - actin binding in solution assays ( Drees et al . , 2005 ; Yamada et al . , 2005 ) , indicating allosteric communication between the a E - catenin N and M domains and the ABD . Consistent with this interpretation , binding of E - cadherin / β - catenin to the N domain promotes conformational changes in H4 of the ABD as assessed by cysteine labeling ( Terekhova et al . , 2019 ) . A full - length αE - catenin homodimer crystal structure ( Rangarajan and Izard , 2013 ) showed that the CTE could pack either intermolecularly or intramolecularly with N and M domains , a result consistent with structural modeling based on small - angle X - ray scattering ( SAXS ) data ( Nicholl et al . , 2018 ) . Previous biochemical data likewise indicate that the a E - catenin N and M domains inhibit cooperative actin binding by the ABD ( Hansen et al . , 2013 ) . Thus , multiple lines of evidence suggest that contacts of the ABD and the N - and / or M - domains , perhaps involving the CTE , regulate the cooperativity of actin binding . Our data likewise support a role for the a E - catenin N and M domains in modulating binding lifetimes under load . Binding lifetimes for the isolated ABD are approximately four - fold longer than for the ternary 9 cadherin - catenin complex ( Figure 3 – figure supplement 3 ) . Indirect evidence suggests this increase in stability may be coupled to cooperative interactions involving the CTE . Binding lifetimes for single - step ABD binding interactions are roughly 4 - fold shorter than those that occur at the end of a multi - step unbinding sequence ( Figure 6A ) , suggesting that neighbor - neighbor interactions can stabilize an actin - bound ABD ( Figure 6C ) . In contrast , single - step and multi - step lifetimes are comparable for the ternary complex ( Figure 6B ) . A plausible explanation for this observation is that the N and / or M domains interfere with cooperative interactions between ABDs , perhaps via interactions with the CTE ( Figure 6D ) . A role for the N - and M - domains in hindering stable binding to F - actin is consistent with optical trap results showing that an α - β - catenin heterodimer forms a transient slip bond with F - actin ( < 20 ms ) in the absence of any bystanders , but that a longer - lived catch bond is recovered when multiple complexes are present ( Arbore et al . , 2022 ) . Whereas the catch bond mechanism for structurally similar actin - binding proteins is likely conserved , it is probable that the way in which force allosterically modulates actin interactions is variable . For example , although vinculin and αE - catenin are paralogs , structural and functional differences underlie their actin binding characteristics . Helices H2 - H5 of the vinculin ABD undergo similar structural rearrangements and share many contacts with actin as in αE - catenin , but their CTEs diverge in sequence and length and interact differently with actin ( Mei et al . , 2020 ) . Additionally , when the autoinhibitory interactions formed between the N and C terminal regions of vinculin are disrupted , actin binding lifetimes for the full - length protein are enhanced two - fold compared to the ABD alone ( Huang et al . , 2017 ) , a trend opposite observed for αE - catenin ( Figure 3 – figure supplement 3 ) . Diversity in actin binding and force transmission may be significant for maintaining intercellular adhesion or coordinating actin dynamics in tissues ( Clarke and Martin , 2021 ; Pollard , 2016 ; Svitkina , 2018 ) Future analyses of how intermolecular and intramolecular interactions in other actin - binding proteins affect mechanotransduction will be required to understand how junctional tension is regulated at cell - cell contacts . 10 Materials and methods Protein expression and purification Mouse GFP - E - cadherin cytoplasmic domain , and zebrafish β - catenin used in the optical trap assay were purified as described ( Bax et al . , 2022 ; Buckley et al . , 2014 ; Yamada et al . , 2005 ) . αE - cateninΔH1 was constructed by inserting DNA encoding zebrafish αE - catenin with deleted H0 and H1 domains ( aa 1 - 666 and 698 - 906 ) into the pPROEX HTb bacterial expression vector . αE - cateninΔH1 was expressed in E . coli BL21 ( DE3 ) cells in 2L LB media culture . Cells were grown at 37°C to an OD 600 of 0 . 8 before induced with 0 . 5 mM isopropyl - 1 - thio - β - d - galactopyranoside . After induction , cells were grown for 16 h at 18°C , harvested by centrifugation , and resuspended in 20 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM β - mercaptoethanol . Cell pellets were lysed with an Emulsiflex ( Avastin ) in the presence of protease inhibitor cocktail Mixture Set V ( Calbiochem ) and DNAse ( Millipore Sigma ) . The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 37 , 000 x g for 30 minutes , and incubated with 10 mL of TALON Superflow resin ( GE Healthcare Life Sciences ) for 1 h on a rotator at 4°C . Resin was washed with 5 bed volumes of 20 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM β - mercaptoethanol , 4 bed volumes of PBS pH 8 . 0 , 1 M NaCl , 0 . 005 % Tween 20 , and 3 bed volumes of 20 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM β - mercaptoethanol , 5 mM imidazole . Protein was eluted from TALON resin in 20 mL of 20 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM β - mercaptoethanol , 150 mM imidazole . The eluate was passed through a 0 . 22 μm PES syringe filter and diluted with 20 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 1 mM DTT to a final volume of 70 mL . Filtered eluate was further purified on an anion exchange column ( MonoQ 10 / 100 , GE Healthcare ) in 20 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 1 mM DTT buffer with a 0 - 1 M NaCl gradient , followed by size exclusion chromatography ( Superdex S200 , GE Healthcare ) in 20 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM DTT . Proteins were stored at - 80°C and never underwent more than one freeze / thaw cycle . αE - catenin ABD and αE - catenin monomer measurements with F - actin in the optical trap assay were performed with a Halotag - ABD construct . The halotag - ABD and halotag - αE - catenin monomer construct was constructed by inserting DNA encoding HaloTag , an 18 residue linker ( SGGGGSGGGGSGGGGSGG ) and either the ABD domain ( aa 666 - 906 ) or full sequence ( aa 2 - 906 ) of zebrafish αE - catenin into the pPROEX HTb bacterial expression vector . halotag - ABD was expressed and purified as described for αE - cateninΔH1 . eGFP was purified and labeled with halotag Succinimidyl Ester ( O4 ) ligand as previously described ( Huang et al . , 2017 ) ( Promega ) . Preparation of fluorescent biotinylated F - actin Actin was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle , stored and biotinylated using biotin - NHS ( Sigma ) as previously described . The biotinylated actin was flash frozen at 24 μM in G - buffer ( 5 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , and 0 . 2 mM ATP ) with 1 mM DTT and stored in - 80 ºC . G - actin was thawed on ice for 30 min and centrifuged in a Beckman TLA100 rotor at 60k RPM for 10 min in 4ºC to remove aggregates . Polymerization of G - actin was induced upon addition of 10X F - buffer ( 100 mM pH 7 . 5 Tris , 500 mM KCl , 20 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM ATP , 10 mM DTT ) and incubated for 1 hr at room temperature while on a rotator . F - actin was diluted to 3 . 5 uM with F - buffer ( 20 mM Tris 8 , 50 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM DTT , 1 mM ATP ) . Lyophilized rhodamine phalloidin ( Cytoskeleton ) was resuspended with methanol ( ACS Spectrophotometric Grade , ≥99 . 9 % , Honeywell ) and added to F - actin in equimolar amounts . Fluorescent biotinylated F - actin was kept on ice at 4 °C for at least one day before use in experiments to allow rhodamine phalloidin to incorporate into filaments and used in optical trapping experiments within 10 days . Aliquots from the same batch of biotinylated actin were used in all single - molecule experiments . Flow cell preparation Nitrocellulose - coated coverslips with attached 1 . 5 μm silica microspheres ( Bangs Laboratories ) and flow cell chambers were prepared as described previously for all optical trap experiments ( Bax et al . , 2022 ; Huang et al . , 2017 , 2017 ) . All injection volumes were 10 μL . The flow cell channel was injected with F - buffer . GFP - E - cadherin was injected and allowed to nonspecifically absorb onto the coverslip and silica 11 microsphere surfaces before being washed out with F - buffer following a 2 - minute incubation . For surface passivation , 5 w / v % pluronic F - 127 ( Sigma , P2443 ) in F - buffer was injected and incubated for 5 minutes , twice . F - buffer was injected into the channel to wash out excess pluronic , twice . β - catenin was injected into the channel and incubated for 2 minutes . Excess protein not bound to immobilized E - cadherin was washed out twice with F - buffer . αE - catenin was subsequently injected and incubated for 2 minutes , where excess protein was washed out twice with F - buffer . 1 mg / ml ultrapure Bovine Serum Albumin ( BSA ; MCLAB , UBSA - 100 ) in F - buffer was injected and incubated for 2 minutes , twice . The channel was finally filled with a trapping solution of 1 mg / ml BSA , 2 mM protocatechuic acid ( Sigma Aldrich ) , 50 nM protocatechuate - 3 , 4 - dioxygenase ( Sigma Aldrich ) , 1 uM Trolox ( Sigma Aldrich ) , 20 μM phallodin , 1 μm streptatvidin - coated polystyrene beads ( Bangs Laboratories ) , and 0 . 2 nM fluorescently labeled biotinylated actin filaments . After the final solution was injected into the flow cell , the open ends of the channel were sealed with vacuum grease ( Dow Corning ) . While surface functionalization of wild - type cadherin - catenin complexes was prepared by subsequent injection of 50 μM GFP - E - cadherin , 100 nM β - catenin , and 75 nM wild - type αE - catenin , all F - actin filaments present in the flow cell were specifically adsorbed to the coverslip surface when flow cells were prepared with αE - cateninΔH1 . Thus , to functionalize surfaces with E - cadherin / β - catenin / αE - cateninΔH1 complexes , 20 μM GFP - E - cadherin , 100 nM β - catenin , and 75 nM αE - cateninΔH1 were subsequently injected through the flow cell chamber . Flow cell chambers for αE - catenin ABD experiments were prepared by described above , but with subsequent injection of 10 μM haloligand - eGFP and 2 μM halotag - ABD . Measurements αE - catenin monomer were similarly carried out but with 1 μM halotag - αE - catenin . Optical trap instrument The optical trap instrument used was described previously ( Bax et al . , 2022 ; Buckley et al . , 2014 ; Huang et al . , 2017 ; Owen et al . , 2022 ) . Bead displacement was calibrated within the linear region of the quadrant photodiode ( QPD ) voltage response for position detection . A stiffness calibration for each trap was performed using power spectral analysis according to previously established methods ( Berg - Sørensen and Flyvbjerg , 2004 ; Hansen et al . , 2006 ) . The trap was operated at a stiffness of 0 . 1 to 0 . 15 pN / nm . Constant - load optical trap assay The dual - beam optical trap assay was carried out as described ( Bax et al . , 2022 ; Buckley et al . , 2014 ; Huang et al . , 2017 ; Owen et al . , 2022 ) . Two optically trapped streptavidin - coated polystyrene beads ( 1 μm , Bangs Laboratories ) were moved apart until 1 - 3 pN of tension was applied to a tethered biotinylated F - actin filament . The F - actin filament was centered near a surface immobilized silica microsphere ( 1 . 5 μm , Bangs Laboratories ) functionalized with ternrayΔH1 complexes . The instrument stage was then oscillated in a trapezoidal waveform with 20 - 75 nm amplitude , 10 nm / ms rise / fall rate , and a 150 ms pause to check for displacement of either trapped bead from binding of cadherin - catenin complexes to F - actin . If a binding event was detected , the stage paused oscillation until trap signal returned to baseline values when all bound complexes released from the filament . Bead position data was collected from each trap at a sampling rate of 40 kHz , and down sampled to 1 kHz for force - lifetime analysis . Binding events that did not survive the 5 ms loading phase or resulted in dumbbell slackening of over 1 . 5 pN were excluded from further analysis . Control experiments in which surface - functionalized silica microspheres were functionalized with E - cadherin / β - catenin resulted in no binding activity . Binding events were annotated with custom software ( Python ) by edge detection analysis , where data traces were convolved with the second order derivative of the Gaussian kernel and change points were identified at zero - crossings ( Haralick , 1987 ) . All events and steps were verified or re - annotated manually . Force associated with each binding event was calculated as previously described ( Bax et al . , 2022 ; Huang et al . , 2017 ) . 12 Low - force optical trap assay Assembly of suspended F - actin filaments , and binding activity determination of cadherin - catenin complexes to F - actin was performed as for a constant - load optical trap assay . After verifying binding activity of ternaryΔH1 complexes functionalized on silica microspheres , the instrument stage was oscillated in a sinusoidal waveform with 20 - 30 nm amplitude and 150 Hz frequency without force - feedback control . Data collected where the positioning of microspheres relative to F - actin resulted in no binding activity was used to establish a baseline in event detection analysis . Signal from each trap collected at 40 kHz was down sampled to 1 kHz . A power spectrum of the sum of bead positions from both traps was computed using a Fourier transform with a moving window of 256 points . The cumulative power from frequencies higher than 300 Hz was calculated at each point and used to determine low - force binding events , as described previously ( Huang et al . , 2017 ) . Deviations of the summed high - frequency power above 180 % of the mean were labeled as a binding event . Binding was often accompanied by a change in the mean position of the trapped beads , resulting in a net force ranging from 0 . 2 to 2 . 5 pN exerted on the F - actin filament . Control experiments where silica microspheres were functionalized with E - cadherin / β - catenin resulted in no binding activity . Model fitting and confidence intervals ( CIs ) All binding lifetime data fits were derived from the last step of multi - step data or single step data from the constant force assay . Best - fit parameters for slip bond models were determined by maximum likelihood estimation ( MLE ) on the individual force - lifetime ternaryΔH1 measurements , pooled from constant - force ( N = 856 ) and low - force ( N = 145 ) observations . All objective function minimizations were performed using the SciPy optimize minimization routine with a L - BFGS - B algorithm . The likelihood function for a slip bond model was : ℒ ( 𝜃 | F , 𝜏 ) = k B→U ( F ) e - k B→U ( F ) τ , where 𝜏 and F represent the bond lifetimes with respect to force measured in single - molecule experiments and 𝜃 are best - fit parameters . The likelihood function for a two - state slip bond was : ℒ ( 𝜃 | F , 𝜏 ) = P 1 k B 1 →U e - k B1→U ( F ) τ + ( 1 - P 1 ) k B 2 →U ( F ) e - k B2→U ( F ) τ where B 1 and B 2 represent the two distinct bound states and P 1 represents the probability of observing a binding event in state 1 . All k i→j ( F ) parameters were described by the Bell model , k i→j ( F ) = k i→j0 e Fx i→j / k b τ . Confidence intervals ( CIs ) were determined by empirical bootstrapping , where each of the 10 , 000 synthetic datasets were constructed by drawing N = 1001 force vs lifetime observations from the ternaryΔH1 dataset with replacement and fit to a model by MLE . MLE objective function minimizations were similarly performed for the two - state catch bond model , and as described previously ( Bax et al . , 2022 ; Huang et al . , 2017 ) , with a Matlab implementation of the genetic algorithm , where 100 epochs were used to find a global minima for each dataset . 95 % CIs on the parameters were determined by identifying parameter values in the 2 . 5 th and 97 . 5 th percentile . CI bounds on the model were determined as 95 % CIs of binding lifetimes , < τ > , at each force predicted by the fits from the 10 , 000 synthetic datasets , evaluated as < τ > = ∫ t × ℒ ( 𝜃 | F , 𝑡 ) dt ∞ 0 . For bootstrapped fits of a two - state catch bond model , 20 epochs of the genetic algorithm were used to find the minima of each synthetic dataset . Structure minimization and analysis Maestro ( Schrödinger ) was used to perform energy minimization ( OPLS 2005 force field ) on isolated ABD structures and actin - docked structures . C 𝛼 RMSD to 6UPV ABD was calculated for aa 711 - 842 . Surface area of actin - binding interfaces was calculated in PyMOL , and RMSD and binding interaction analysis was carried out in ChimeraX for all energy - minimized structures . Structural figures were prepared with UCSF ChimeraX version 1 . 3 . 13 Acknowledgements We thank Dr . Nicholas A . Bax for his contributions in the early stages of this project and Dr .

Nature Cell Biology . doi : 10 . 1038 / ncb2055 17 Table 1 . Kinetic parameters for the two - bound - state catch bond model for αE - catenin ABD ( top ) and monomer ( bottom ) . State 0 is the unbound state , state 1 is the weak bound state , and state 2 is the strong bound state . The 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) was determined for each parameter via empirical bootstrapping . The transition rate between state i and j under no load is indicated by k i→j0 , whereas the distance between the initial state , i , and the transition state between i and j is given by x i→j . A negative distance parameter indicates that the transition rate is decreased by force .

( A ) Cell - cell adhesions in epithelia are reinforced under tension . Mechanotransduction at adherens junctions is mediated by both homophilic extracellular E - cadherin ( green ) interactions that establish adhesion between cells , and intracellular interactions of the cadherin - catenin complex with actin . Intracellularly , the cytosolic tail of E - cadherin binds to β - catenin ( yellow ) and αE - catenin ( red ) which forms a catch bond with F - actin . The structure of the αE - catenin ABD complexed with F - actin is the basis for the catch bond mechanistic model ( Mei et al . , 2020 ; Xu et al . , 2020 ) . ( B ) Structure of full - length αE - catenin . αE - catenin ( N and M domains : pdb 4igg ) has a N - terminal domain that binds β - catenin , a middle ( M ) domain , and a flexible linker to the C - terminal ABD ( pdb 6dv1 ) . The ABD ( red ) is comprised of a five - helix bundle , preceded by a short N - terminal helix designated as H0 , and a C - terminal extension ( CTE ) . Helices H0 and H1 ( residues 666 - 696 ) are outlined in blue . actin α E - catenin β - catenin E - cadherin membrane cytoplasm F F ( - ) ( + ) myosin H0 H1 N I N II M I M II M III ABD 1 26 50 63 66 90 β - catenin N I N II M I M I M III ABD H1 H0 A B 20 Figure 2 . Mechanistic hypothesis of two - state catch bond from ABD structures . ( A ) Comparison of isolated ( red , pdb 6dv1 ) and actin - bound ( blue , pdb 6upv ) αE - catenin ABDs . In the actin - bound structure , H0 and H1 become disordered and H2 - H5 rearrange ( yellow arrows ) . The CTE , which is disordered in the isolated structure , forms an extended peptide and interacts with actin . ( B ) Two - state catch bond model . αE - catenin ABD interacts with F - actin in either the weak or strong conformational state , denoted as state 1 and state 2 , respectively . The unbound state is represented as state 0 . The association of H0 and H1 with the four - helix bundle in the weak state ( 1 ) inhibits the ABD from rearranging into the strong state ( 2 ) conformation . The transitions between states are force dependent , and dissociation rates k 1→0 and k 2→0 increase exponentially with respect to applied load . Force also increases k 1→2 , the transition rate from state 1 to state 2 , but decreases k 2→1 . Tension applied to state 1 promotes the dissociation of H0 and H1 and the structural rearrangement of H2 - H5 into state 2 .

( A ) ( Top ) GFP - haloligand and fusion protein Halotag - ABD ( red ) complexes are immobilized on silica microspheres attached to a microscope coverslip . A taut actin filament is suspended between two optically trapped beads and held over the assembled complexes . The stage is translated parallel to the actin filament , and when at least one protein complex binds to F - actin , the trapped beads are pulled out of their equilibrium position . The restoring force of the optical trap ( black arrows ) applies tension on a bound complex while bystander complexes ( pale ) bind and unbind transiently . ( B ) A representative force vs . time series for the constant - force assay . ( Top ) Plotted are the forces summed from both traps versus time , decimated from 40 to 4 kHz . We observe traces characterized either by rupture of a single bound molecule ( left ) or by sequential rupture of multiple bound molecules ( right ) . Traces colored in black are regions used for force baseline determination , and vertical lines indicate step boundaries . ( Bottom ) If summed forces surpass a threshold , stage motion halts until detachment of the final bound molecule . ( C ) αE - catenin ABD forms a catch bond with F - actin ( N = 900 ) .

In this model , the ternaryΔH1 complex interacts with F - actin in a moderately - strong bound state ( B 1 ) and strongly bound state ( B 2 ) , such that that the deletion of H0 and H1 hinders the transition between B 1 and B 2 to impart biphasic binding lifetimes .

Lifetime survival analysis for wildtype E - cadherin / β - catenin / αE - catenin and E - cadherin / β - catenin / αE - cateninΔH1 . Survival probability vs . binding lifetime from constant - force measurements for each 2 pN bin width . ( A ) Survival lifetimes are more likely to be longer for ternaryΔH1 ( blue ) than wild - type ternary ( red ) between 0 - 2 pN . ( B ) The ternaryΔH1 complex survival probability distribution is qualitatively more monophasic when compared to wild - type ternary . ( C ) Binding lifetimes for ternaryΔH1 are more likely to be shorter than wild - type ternary complex between 4 - 6 pN . The ternaryΔH1 complex is qualitatively more monophasic than wild - type . ( D - F ) Above 6 pN , ternary wild - type and ternaryΔH1 complex survival probability distributions at these force bins are not statistically different ( p < 0 . 01 , two sample KS test ) . A B C D E F 31 Figure 5 – figure supplement 3 . Molecular basis of catch bond directionality . ( A ) Force directed in the ( - ) direction of ternary wild - type . When force is applied in the ( - ) direction , H1 is moved away from H2 - H5 and oriented such that reassociation of H0 / H1 to the H2 - H5 bundle is disfavored ( dotted lines ) . ( B ) Force directed in ( + ) direction of ternary wildtype . When force is applied in the ( + ) direction , H1 is predicted to be positioned relatively closer to the H2 - H5 bundle , where the bound ABD may more likely adopt conformations similar to the five - helix weak state ( dotted lines ) .

( A ) Computed lifetime ratios ( LR ) with a 4 pN sliding window across 0 - 13 pN showing that lifetimes from ABD multi - step events are longer than single - step events ( mean LR = 3 . 54 ) . Envelopes represent 90 % confidence intervals , obtained via empirical bootstrapping mean ( 90 % CI = 1 . 69 - 9 . 83 ) . ( B ) Wildtype ternary lifetimes from multi - step and single - step events have similar binding lifetimes ( mean LR = 1 . 15 , 90 % CI = 0 . 68 - 1 . 78 ) . ( C ) Upon stable binding with actin , a loaded ABD could enable stronger binding to actin by neighbors by allosteric coupling of involving contacts of the CTE and the H2 - H5 bundle . ( D ) The loaded ternary complex may interact with its neighbor differently than the ABD . Allosteric regulation of the ABD by the other a E - catenin domains , steric effects of the large N - M region , and / or differences in force propagation could prevent rearrangements in the ABD that would enhance its load - bearing capacity .
