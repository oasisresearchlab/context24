Grounded in seventeen interviews with blind weavers and sighted instructors , we built Simphony , an audio - tactile system that aims to support blind weavers in creating and perceiving patterns . Findings from eight design exploration sessions at the community studio reveal how blind weavers used Simphony to learn the process of pattern design and generate patterns with sighted instructors . We refect on collaborative understanding of pattern design among blind and sighted individuals and discuss opportunities for integrating tech - nological augmentations into traditional craftwork .

By ofering varied representations of disability experience , disability art disrupts the ableist narrative that views disability as a defcit [ 130 ] , exposes exclusionary social norms [ 10 ] , and promotes ∗ This work was done while Maitraye Das was at Northwestern University .

Consider the following quote from one of our informants , Lisa , 1 a legally blind and nerve deaf musician , songwriter , and weaver who has been part of a community weaving studio for visually impaired adults for 9 years : “Our music , our weaving , art is a part of our lives . . . In my case , as a visually impaired person—from spinning to knitting to crocheting to weaving . . . I wanna keep this art alive so that whether you go to a cultural center or civic center , you go through the Smithsonian , you see my legacy , you’ll see it for plenty of years to come . . . Whether you knew my name or not . . . my name is in my work . This is who I was . ” The rich practices and innovative work produced by disabled artists have long been discussed within Disability Studies literature [ 130 , 133 , 135 ] ; yet , disabled artists and makers like Lisa are rarely fea - tured in the extensive scholarship on making and design . Recent HCI research has called attention to the ways elite status of design excludes and under - values labor of certain communities [ 11 , 51 , 89 ] including those of disabled people [ 95 ] and tends to view them as non - designers while positioning non - disabled people as designing for them [ 16 , 17 ] . Relatedly , scholars have started studying why and how disabled people engage in making [ 15 , 26 , 64 , 75 , 120 ] and how their labor of making is valued [ 37 ] . Others have identifed existing accessibility issues in makerspaces [ 95 , 121 ] and maker technologies [ 27 , 73 , 74 ] and built new solutions to address these issues [ 106 , 117 ] . Much of this prior work focuses on enabling op - portunities for disabled people to perform making independently [ 27 , 56 , 75 , 87 , 95 ] . Recently , however , Disability Studies and ac - cessibility scholars have started moving from independence to an interdependence perspective [ 14 , 62 , 96 , 129 , 132 ] , highlighting the roles that both disabled people and their non - disabled allies and collaborators play in accessible making [ 37 , 67 , 68 , 133 ] . Aligning with this rhetorical turn , our work examines the collaborative prac - tice of fabric pattern design within a US - based community of blind weavers who create hand - woven products with sighted instructors . To date , limited prior studies have investigated accessibility in traditional forms of making and fber arts , although disabled people have a long history of involvement in these practices [ 23 , 34 , 50 ] . Moreover , fber arts like weaving are often regarded as precursors of computing [ 49 , 127 ] that foreground under - acknowledged stories of design [ 115 ] . The process of designing fabric patterns is algorithmic in nature in that weavers can produce numerous patterns by com - bining and repeating sequences in diferent orders . Pattern design also requires visualizing weaving sequences and fabric previews that portray various geometric shapes , e . g . , diamonds , squares , or 1 All names are pseudonyms CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Das , et al . ovals . Thus , studying accessible pattern design can reveal new un - derstandings of visual - spatial information processing [ 31 , 83 , 102 ] and algorithmic thinking among blind individuals . Furthermore , the limited prior work that did explore fber arts practices among blind artists revealed that these artists value creating high - quality fabrics and unique designs that are not only visually appealing to sighted recipients but also aesthetically meaningful to themselves [ 20 , 37 , 56 , 61 ] . Hence , to understand and enhance accessible mak - ing and fber arts , it is important to examine the ways in which blind individuals engage in the design aspects of weaving—of which pat - tern drafting is a signifcant part—and develop new ways to make this process more accessible to blind weavers . To this end , the present paper analyzes how blind weavers work with sighted instructors to design , plan , and execute the complex procedure of generating fabric patterns and introduces a new sys - tem to explore whether and how technology can augment their design workfow . Grounded in our formative interviews with four - teen blind weavers and three sighted instructors , we developed Simphony , an audio - tactile system that incorporates sonifcation techniques , spoken audio , and a tactile overlay to better support blind weavers in creating and perceiving fabric patterns . We report fndings from eight design exploration sessions , detailing how blind weavers and sighted instructors used Simphony to generate new patterns together , what they learned from these activities , and how they valued and made sense of their creations . Our work makes three primary contributions . First , we provide a deeper empirical understanding of how blind and sighted collab - orators work together to anticipate the look and feel of the fnal woven product and conceptualize how a fabric comes into being from particular confgurations of fbers and physical operations on the loom . Our fndings complement prior research that explores the intersection of crafting and interaction design ( e . g . , [ 43 , 49 , 52 , 115 ] ) , foregrounding the ways in which blind weavers engage in design work . Second , we introduce a variety of audio - tactile techniques to help blind weavers learn underlying mechanisms of weaving , revealing novel insights about collaborative understanding of pat - tern design . Third , by analyzing the case of pattern design , we discuss ways to integrate technological augmentations into tradi - tional forms of craft and how blind artists can combine diferent art forms ( e . g . , music and weaving ) to foster creative expression . 2 RELATED WORK Our study extends the literature on digital augmentations in fber arts , technologies developed to support accessible making and visual - spatial information processing as well as ongoing theorizing of interdependence in accessibility . 2 . 1 Digital Augmentations in Fiber Arts Computer - aided tools have long been embraced by fber artists , especially for designing fabric patterns ( e . g . , WeaveIt [ 7 ] and Fiber - works [ 2 ] ) . Simultaneously , researchers have been exploring new technological augmentations to fber arts . For instance , Rosner and Ryokai [ 114 ] designed Spyn , a system that enabled knitters to em - bed digitally recorded messages into knitted fabrics . Albaugh et al . [ 8 ] investigated ways to create unconventional fabric patterns and assembled a handloom with 3D - printed parts that allowed various 2 . 3 Accessing and Understanding Visual - Spatial Information forms of fexible manipulation of patterns , such as by following a collaboratively edited draft pattern in real time [ 9 ] . Another ex - ample of a digital pattern fabrication tool is Loominary [ 124 ] , a game where a fabric pattern emerges through players’ moves as they input their choices using weaving materials . Devendorf and colleagues modifed traditional weaving techniques ( e . g . , double weaving ) [ 44 ] and developed smart textile designing tools that allow weavers to simultaneously draft weave structures and electronic circuitry [ 54 ] and create reusable , easy - to - unravel patterns [ 136 ] . Hofmann et al . [ 66 , 69 ] built programming toolkits for generating knitting textures based on user - defned aesthetics . Others inno - vated non - traditional means for creating weave patterns , such as by using 3D - printed water - soluble drafts [ 42 ] or playing music on a digital device [ 137 ] . Although this prior work has developed a number of techniques to digitally augment fber arts practices , these tools still require interacting with graphics - heavy interfaces that are not accessible to blind individuals . 2 . 2 Accessibility in Making Tools and Practices Within HCI , a burgeoning body of work explores making practices among disabled people [ 26 , 120 ] . Researchers found that engag - ing in making and fabrication helps disabled individuals develop a sense of autonomy , agency , and empowerment [ 75 , 95 ] and chal - lenge notions of normalcy [ 15 , 64 ] . Others examined accessibility barriers associated with the design , adoption , and adaptation of maker technologies ( e . g . , 3D modeling software ) [ 27 , 73 , 74 ] and physical makerspaces [ 95 , 121 ] . Consequently , researchers devel - oped ways to better support accessibility in digital fabrication and electronic circuitry tools and practices [ 106 ] . For instance , Siu et al . [ 117 ] built shapeCAD , an accessible 3D modeling workfow that helps blind people form a mental model of design objects through haptic feedback from a 2 . 5D shape display . Closely related to our work are the studies that analyze fber arts practices among disabled people . Gotfrid et al . [ 61 ] investi - gated accessibility challenges profcient disabled knitters face while creating knitting patterns . Giles et al . [ 56 ] conducted workshops with visually impaired people with little or no weaving experi - ence , where participants created personalized art objects using e - textiles and beginner - friendly looms . Others incorporated semi - automated functionalities in a handloom [ 109 ] and built a system called Melodie that senses physical operation on loom components and emits musical cues to facilitate blind weavers’ awareness of the loom state [ 20 ] . Collectively , this prior work focuses on im - proving accessibility in the physical operations of fber arts that involve direct interaction with the loom . We complement this work by augmenting blind weavers’ engagement in the pattern design process that happens before one starts weaving on a loom but has signifcant implications for how the end product takes shape . Studying accessible pattern design can also deepen our understand - ing of how blind people process visual - spatial information more broadly , given that pattern design requires comprehending shapes , colors , and spatial positioning of diferent components within a fabric . Synthesized speech ( e . g . , screen reading ) , non - speech audio Simphony : Enhancing Accessible Patern Design Practices among Blind Weavers CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany ( e . g . , earcons , auditory icons ) , sonifcation ( i . e . , mapping data val - ues to sound parameters ) , and spatial audio are some of the most common auditory techniques that researchers have explored to support accessibility in visual - spatial tasks , such as understanding graphs and fgures [ 1 , 4 , 53 ] . Compared to the linear and ephemeral nature of audio [ 102 , 108 ] , the spatiality and permanence of physi - cal objects allow simultaneous exploration , for which tactile / haptic perception has long been a common method among blind people for processing spatial information [ 13 , 28 , 41 ] . Researchers have developed new tactile / haptic techniques such as using refreshable pin - matrix displays [ 21 , 92 , 108 ] , 3D models built with fabrication tools [ 28 ] , and force feedback mechanisms [ 53 , 100 ] . Overall , sensory integration , i . e . , enabling both touch and sound afordances better aid perception of visual - spatial content [ 31 , 83 ] . For example , on touchscreen devices , blind users’ understanding of spatial information and geometric shapes improved when propri - oception from touch gestures were combined with screen reader announcements [ 102 ] or sonifcation [ 91 ] . To further facilitate blind people’s understanding of spatial layout on touchscreen devices , researchers have built tactile [ 81 , 88 ] and auditory overlays [ 80 ] . Others combined sonifcation with vibrotactile feedback on touch - screen devices [ 60 ] and physical icons on tabletop interfaces [ 94 ] to improve accessibility of graphical content . Despite this extensive research , the ways blind people process visual - spatial informa - tion while performing design work and collaboration with sighted people remains largely overlooked [ 83 , 102 ] ( for some notable ex - ceptions , see [ 22 , 35 , 41 ] ) . We contribute to this literature by inves - tigating how blind weavers utilize an audio - tactile system to design and perceive weave patterns together with sighted collaborators . 2 . 4 Interdependence in Ability - Diverse Collaboration Accessibility research within HCI has predominantly centered around supporting disabled people in performing activities ( e . g . , navigation ) independently [ 86 ] . Recently , however , Disability Studies scholars and activists have critiqued viewing independence as the ideal goal of accessibility [ 77 ] and instead shifted focus to the notion of inter - dependence [ 33 , 62 , 96 , 111 , 132 ] , which “recognize [ s ] the value of depending on others and being depended upon” [ 131 ] . Drawing on this scholarship , Bennett et al . [ 14 ] positioned interdependence— rather than dependence or independence—as a way of challenging ability - based hierarchies in assistive technology design and illus - trated how “people with heterogeneous abilities [ . . . ] pool their strengths to achieve shared access . ” The interdependence perspec - tive underscores the “care work” [ 101 ] both disabled and non - disabled people perform to enable and sustain access and the mutual relationship forged in this process [ 18 ] . For instance , Goodwin [ 59 ] demonstrates how Chil , an aphasic man who can speak only three words , acts as a competent speaker by connecting his limited ut - terances and gestures to the elaborated talk and actions of others . Goodwin argues that Chil’s ability to engage in meaningful con - versation is “deeply embedded within the actions of others as they build lives together” [ 59 ] . Instead of minimizing or replacing human assistance altogether , researchers have started calling attention to the ways in which technology can amplify allyship and caregiving activities [ 67 , 129 ] , support relational maintenance [ 36 , 119 ] , and Figure 1 : Left : Basic components of a loom ( e . g . , warp , weft , shuttle , shafts , heddles , front and back beams ) are marked . Right : Weaving draft of a twill pattern . See Section 3 for details about weaving drafts . play a meaningful role in the negotiation of ability and assistance [ 38 , 126 ] . Similarly , although much of the prior work on accessible making has focused on facilitating independent making among dis - abled people [ 27 , 56 , 75 , 87 , 95 ] , recent research has questioned the independence rhetoric , showing the roles of non - disabled collabo - rators in constructing access , such as clinicians ensuring the safety of fabricated prostheses [ 68 ] and family members and caregivers creating adaptations as a form of building their ally identity [ 37 , 67 ] . We draw on and extend this body of research by centering the col - laborative practices of blind and sighted weavers and enhancing how these ability - diverse groups generate patterns together . 3 BACKGROUND : WEAVING PROCESS AND DESIGNING A WEAVING DRAFT Weaving involves interlacing two sets of yarns at right angles to form a fabric . The vertical yarns ( called warp ) are held stationary in tension between two beams at the front and back of the loom , while the horizontal yarn ( called weft ) is inserted over and under the warps ( Figure 1 , left ) . Between the two beams , warps pass through needle - like structures called heddles , each with an opening through which an individual warp yarn is passed . Heddles are suspended vertically from frames called shafts . Each shaft along with their heddles can be moved up / down to separate the warps into two planes , forming a vertical gap , i . e . , shed . The movement of the shafts is controlled by pressing down treadles ( i . e . , pedals ) by foot or pulling down levers by hand according to pre - defned sequences . The weft is then inserted through the shed using a carrier device called a shuttle . As the shuttle moves back and forth through the shed , it weaves an edge on each side of the fabric to prevent the fabric from unraveling . Each pass of the weft yarn is called a pick . To ensure that the desired pattern appears on the fabric , a weaver needs to prepare a 2 - dimensional set of instructions ( called the weav - ing draft ) [ 72 ] before starting to weave on a loom ( Figure 1 , right ) . The draft comprises three input panels : a threading sequence that decides which warp yarn will be connected to which shaft through heddles ; a tie - up table that maps which shafts are tied to which treadles ; and a treadling sequence that dictates the order in which treadles are pressed during weaving . These input panels determine the resultant fabric pattern , which is graphically represented in the drawdown , i . e . , the 2D grid where each cell shows whether the weft yarn lies over or under the warp yarn at each intersection . CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Das , et al . 4 FORMATIVE STUDY : METHOD To understand accessibility in pattern design , we conducted inter - views with fourteen blind weavers and three sighted instructors with the approval from our feldsite and the Institutional Review Board of Northwestern University . 4 . 1 Participants Among our participants , twelve blind weavers were residents of a community weaving studio situated within an assisted living fa - cility for adults with vision impairments and other chronic health conditions . Additionally , we interviewed two sighted instructors who taught weaving at the community studio . We learned from the interviews that the blind weavers at this studio did not directly participate in designing patterns ; rather , they communicated their ideas and choices about colors and textures of yarns verbally to the instructors who then executed the planning , designing , and setup steps . As such , to better understand how blind weavers may directly engage in pattern generation , we invited ( through snow - ball sampling ) two expert blind weavers , Amy and Erin 2 and their sighted instructor Cora for interviews . Amy and Erin , who had over 25 and 7 years of weaving experience respectively , weaved at home on their personal looms and took part in every step of the design process , starting from planning a project , creating weaving drafts , and following the drafts to setup a loom . They were afliated with a diferent fber arts institute where they worked with other sighted and blind weavers during a week - long weaving workshop hosted every Summer . Table 1 details participants’ self - reported disabilities , weaving knowledge , and relevant experience . 4 . 2 Procedure We conducted semi - structured interviews between November 2020 and February 2021 using phone or Zoom—whichever participants preferred . Interviews started with collecting participants’ verbal consent . While interviewing participants afliated with the commu - nity studio , we asked them to walk us through how blind weavers came up with ideas for new projects or patterns , probing for what roles sighted instructors played in this process and how they sup - ported weavers’ involvement . During the sessions with expert blind weavers and their sighted instructor , we focused on understanding their design process in detail , especially how blind weavers created and read weaving drafts and how they adapted to any challenges they encountered while drafting patterns . We concluded by asking all participants to think openly about new ways of designing and understanding fabric patterns . After collecting participants’ open - ended thoughts , we sought their opinions on exploring patterns on a paper - based tactile graphic , a braille display , or a digital app with musical sounds . Each interview lasted 60 - 90 minutes . Partic - ipants were compensated with US $ 30 each . All interviews were conducted one - on - one , except the one with Amy and Erin , who preferred to attend the session together over Zoom . We directly observed pattern design techniques for those who connected over video ( i . e . , Sara , Laura , and Erin ) . Interviews were either audio or video - recorded and later transcribed for analysis . 2 Throughout this paper , we refer to Amy and Erin as ‘expert’ weavers to distinguish them from the blind weavers at the community studio . 4 . 3 Data Analysis We analyzed data following the refexive thematic analysis method [ 25 ] . We began by thoroughly reading and open - coding each tran - script , taking an inductive approach . Next , we collated the codes into initial themes that captured phenomena such as understanding pattern formation , co - creating adaptations , and embedding mean - ing into fabrics . Through several iterations , we developed four fnal themes that highlighted salient aspects of blind weavers’ pattern design process . Our analysis is shaped by our 3 . 5 - year partnership with the assisted living facility , including the frst author’s eight - month - long in - person volunteer work at the weaving studio . Our immersion provided deeper insight into this community’s values and ethos around promoting blind weavers’ creativity through dy - namic support and upholding their agency in securing assistance without overstepping to help . Nevertheless , we acknowledge that our position as sighted researchers inherently introduces power diferentials in our relation with the community and shapes our analytic perspectives [ 25 ] . We discuss this further in Section 9 . 4 . 5 FORMATIVE STUDY : FINDINGS Our analysis revealed the ways in which blind weavers express themselves through pattern design , perceive patterns on woven fabrics , visualize patterns before weaving , and use tactile represen - tations to facilitate their understanding of patterns . 5 . 1 Self - Expression through Pattern Design Although blind weavers at the community studio did not directly take part in designing patterns , our interviews revealed that they deeply cared about creating aesthetically meaningful , high - quality products and decided upon various design parameters such as tex - tures , colors , and acoustics of their woven pieces . To them , woven fabrics embodied a form of storytelling , where each yarn—through its unique texture and interrelationship with surrounding yarns— conveyed moments from the weaver’s imagination or relics of their lived experiences . Lisa explained , “As blind people , [ we ] want to tell a story using our senses , using our hands . And we want others to understand our world as well as theirs . ” She described how her in - digenous and African - American roots infuenced her color choices : “I want to do some African colors versus Indian colors . . . Brown , green , basically earth tones , the way we as American Indian tribes did . ” As another poignant example , Helen made a memorial ribbon during the pandemic “representing the people [ who ] lived here and passed on here ( at the assisted living facility ) . . . [ with ] blueish gray , then beige . . . and then red for the tip of the cane for the blind . ” Developing a shared understanding of such entrenched values was critical for sighted instructors as well so that they could attune to the weavers’ narratives while modifying design parameters of a project . Interestingly , music was a key part of how many weavers ex - pressed themselves through pattern design . Especially those who were profcient musicians felt that “weaving and music go hand in hand . ” Noah said , “Whenever I play a note , it makes me think of diferent designs to weave with . ” For Lisa , “the softness of the instru - ments . . . the texture of the music” —all evoked new imaginations about colors , textures , and patterns . In a communal project called “sound weaving” ( Figure 2 ) , these weavers attached to their woven pieces various objects that made sounds when touched or rubbed Simphony : Enhancing Accessible Patern Design Practices among Blind Weavers CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Table 1 : Details of Participants .

( e . g . , bells , beads , aluminum foil , pop can tabs , cellophane , etc . ) or are associated with music and personally meaningful to them , for instance , cassette tapes and guitar strings that the weavers owned and mp3 players with audio recordings of them “doing the rhythm of the loom , ” i . e . , performing weaving motions ( Noah ) , playing in - struments ( Lisa ) , or imitating screen reader voices ( Paul ) . Thus , blind weavers at the community studio valued integrating their own narratives into the weaving process through textures , colors , and acoustics . However , inaccessible draft design tools cou - pled with inadequate resources and limited time for training ( e . g . , a small numb er of instructors and shared looms ) made it challenging for these weavers to fully participate in pattern design . Still several CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Das , et al . Figure 2 : A tapestry from the ‘Sound weaving’ project with an assortment of sound - making objects attached , e . g . , cassette tape , bells , aluminum foil , wax paper , and mp3 players . weavers ( Eric , Tina , Helen , Adam , and Beth ) wanted “to be shown what the pattern looks like in the instructors’ book” or to “look at the computer program and try to copy what it looks like on the loom . ” Paul , Ruby , and Tina even showed enthusiasm for listening to pat - terns where colors would be represented with music . Instructor Sara added , “Giving them more to do with the [ design ] process would increase their involvement , appreciation and enjoyment of the whole activity . ” These excerpts indicate the potential value of new design tools that can enrich blind weavers’ creative expression through the fusion of music and weaving . 5 . 2 Iteratively Perceiving Patterns on Woven Fabrics Although the blind weavers in our study were interested in taking a more active role in the design process , a key challenge involved perceiving fabric patterns . Echoing fndings from previous work [ 20 , 37 ] , blind weavers shared that they “can feel the zigzag of the designs” ( Tina ) by tracing fabrics under their fngertips . To better detect patterns , expert blind weavers , Amy and Erin , inspected the fabric as it formed on the loom while weaving . Erin said , “Di - amonds , ovals , diagonals — everything stands out when it’s under tension , ” whereas the shapes get “harder to see” ( Amy ) once the woven fabric is taken out of the loom because the lack of tension makes the yarns “blend together . ” Perceiving shapes by touch be - comes even more difcult when yarns have fewer textures , patterns have intricate details , and when weavers have reduced dexterity or tactile perception ability due to other health conditions . In such cases , sighted instructors provided embodied guidance by drawing the pattern on blind weavers’ arms or guiding their fngertips along the pattern while describing its visual - spatial properties . Amy ex - plained : “If something wasn’t quite cemented in our head . . . If it’s a more complex sample , she ( sighted instructor ) will take a fngertip and use it as you’d [ use ] a pencil . And she’ll say , ‘See how this diamond connects , see how this goes up and then down . ”’ Even when the textures in a fabric were tactually discernible , blind weavers sometimes found it difcult to gather a holistic pic - ture of composite patterns that comprised smaller shapes spatially dispersed on the fabric ( Figure 3 , right ) . Since the emergent shapes connected with each other in multi - faceted ways , blind and sighted weavers constructed their own interpretations for the shapes , which did not always align ( Figure 3 , left ) . To develop a detailed under - standing of composite patterns , Amy and Erin examined the fabric Figure 3 : Left : A pattern that Erin tactually perceives as “ovals connected” but her sighted collaborator perceived diferently . Right : ‘Overshot , ’ a composite pattern Erin created , consist - ing of diferent shapes in the corner and in the middle . repeatedly as it formed on the loom thread - by - thread , incrementally unfolding the patterns . Blind weavers shared their excitement when experiencing a pattern for the frst time this way . Erin exclaimed , “Sometimes I’m just totally mystifed and amazed ! It’s so wonderful to see a design I never even thought about pop up . ” While there is a sense of joy and surprise in discovering new shapes serendipitously , having a precise understanding of the end product before starting to weave on a loom is important to ensure that the resultant pattern aligns with what the weaver intended to create in the frst place , which we detail next . 5 . 3 Learning to Visualize Patterns Before Weaving To design a weaving draft , weavers need to understand the underly - ing mechanisms of the loom and the weaving algorithm , specifcally how the threading of warp yarns , tying of shafts and treadles , and the order of pressing treadles alter the resultant patterns . Sighted weavers can easily perceive this interrelationship on graphical draft designing applications , which display the output pattern immedi - ately when changes are made to the input sequences . Since these applications are inaccessible , expert blind weavers “visualized in [ their ] heads” how a pattern would come out if they modifed the threading , tie - up , and treadling in certain ways . Amy explained , “I fgure out—if I did this threading [ sequence ] , it would make a diagonal to the right . If I did this , it would make a diagonal to the left . If I did this , it would make a square block . . . ” Thus , Amy and Erin engaged in a form of algorithmic thinking as they developed a mental im - agery for resultant patterns based on numerical sequences . They referred to this process of formulating new patterns as “drawing . . . a 3D picture” ( Erin ) or solving “a jigsaw puzzle – you just put [ shapes ] together and make them ft " ( Amy ) . Mastering this ‘visualization’ technique , however , required years of practice and honing their understanding of the weaving algorithm . These weavers also took inspiration from geometric “design models” such as the Fibonacci series and repeated smaller shapes in the order of 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , etc . , to maintain aesthetics and integrity of their woven pieces . Build - ing on established design concepts this way made the process of conceptualizing new patterns “much less stressful for me , ” said Erin . They also frequently collaborated with each other to brainstorm unique design ideas . “We love working together because we grasp concepts very similarly . And that really helps a lot , ” explained Amy .

Right : Erin shows the scrabble board she used to draft and explore patterns . Pieces are arranged in a diagonal sequence . Still , it took them a long time to mentally calculate how a pattern would turn out , especially when they intended to design intricate , non - uniform patterns where the same shape did not repeat “all the way across” on the fabric ( e . g . , overshot in Figure 3 , right ) . In such cases , they relied on trial and error , for example by weaving small samples on a loom while iteratively modifying sequences , to fgure out what combination of threading , treadling , and tie - up would lead to their desired outcome . Alternatively , they wrote down numerical sequences in text documents using Microsoft Word and shared those documents with their sighted teacher Cora who then ran the sequences on a draft designing software to check for mistakes . Thus , inaccessible design tools put blind weavers at a disadvantage , where at best , they must use trial and error on the loom or rely on sighted collaborators to digitize patterns , or at worst , not participate in pattern designing at all . 5 . 4 Exploring Patterns through Tactile Representations To address the complexities associated with conceptualizing fabric patterns , our participants adopted various techniques to facilitate blind weavers’ tactile perception of patterns and formulation of weaving drafts . Some instructors thought that “macro samples” ( Figure 4 , left ) made of rough yarns , ropes , or sandpapers could make it easier for blind weavers to “identify when threads are going over versus under” ( Sara ) . Cora , however , noted this technique as “exceedingly tedious to do” for replicating complex patterns . Instead , she along with expert blind weavers Amy and Erin devised other adaptive solutions by repurposing everyday objects and building new bespoke tools . For instance , they reappropriated blind - friendly scrabble boards with raised gridlines and arranged scrabble pieces in diferent sequences to fnd the one that they liked the most ( Figure 4 , right ) . Erin also experimented with other strategies such as drawing raised lines on cellophane paper over rubber board or arranging square - head tacks on poster boards with small sticks of toothpicks glued on the tacks . These customized techniques still required signifcant cognitive efort for calculating drawdowns manually from numerical sequences . Amy and Erin , instead , wanted to use tools that would allow them to readily experiment with and compare diferent patterns as well as easily recreate existing drafts . Erin said , “I don’t want to have to create ( calculate ) everything I do . I like something my friend made—I just want to know how to recreate it . ” They envisioned that preparing “enlarged” and “raised” copies of drawdowns with instructor Cora could potentially help them understand and build on pre - designed patterns . 5 . 5 Summary Overall , our formative work illustrates three key insights for build - ing accessible pattern drafting tools . First , blind weavers need ac - cessible tools that can automatically generate output drawdowns from input threading , treadling , and tie - up sequences to allow for rapid exploration without having to expend undue cognitive ef - fort and time for manually calculating patterns . Second , tangible materials that make individual warp - weft interlacements tactually more prominent and easily manipulable can help blind weavers perceive and alter intricate details of patterns that might other - wise be difcult to do on woven fabrics . Third , pattern design tools that combine multiple modalities and art forms seem promising for enhancing creative expression among blind weavers . 6 SYSTEM DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT Our formative study informed the design of SIMPhoNY ( Sonifed Interactive Musical Patterns for iNterlacement of Yarns ) , a draft designing tool to support blind weavers in creating , perceiving , and modifying fabric patterns through auditory and tactile feedback . Simphony consists of two components : ( 1 ) a web application pri - marily designed for tablet devices and ( 2 ) a wooden grid with blocks . We drew on prior research showing that audio - tactile representa - tions better support blind people’s spatial perception in complex tasks than either audio or tactile cues alone [ 31 , 99 , 108 ] . The de - sign of Simphony was guided by an iterative process starting with formative interviews followed by a pilot session conducted with sighted instructors , Sara and Leah , at the community studio . 6 . 1 Digital Component : Simphony Application Although weaving is fundamentally a tangible and embodied craft , we incorporated a digital application into the process to address the needs for rapid exploration and multimodal augmentation ( Section 5 . 5 ) . Moreover , much of pattern drafting nowadays is performed with the help of digital apps [ 2 , 7 , 54 ] . Similar to these drafting apps , the core functionality of Simphony is to auto - generate a drawdown ( i . e . , fabric preview ) from input sequences such as threading , tread - ling , and tie - up ( Figure 5 ) . What sets Simphony apart from other drafting apps is that it incorporates a variety of text - to - speech and sonifcation techniques to make the pattern generation and exploration process more accessible to blind weavers . It supports standard tap gestures that blind people use on touchscreen devices , e . g . , single tap for listening to an item and double tap for select - ing / deselecting it . Simphony is implemented in Javascript using Web Audio API for audio efects and SVG . js and Bootstrap . css for visual renderings . Our code repository is publicly available . 6 . 1 . 1 Sonification Techniques . Simphony indicates the warp or weft yarns with a categorical audio parameter , timbre ( i . e . , tonal quality ) of diferent musical instruments . Weavers can assign an instrument to warp or weft from eight available options chosen from diverse instrument families to allow for distinguishable variation in timbre . These are : struck string ( piano ) , plucked string ( guitar , harp ) , bowed string ( cello ) , aerophone ( church organ ) , brass ( trombone ) , woodwind ( saxophone ) , and percussion ( vibraphone ) . We created short mp3 fles for musical notes in an entire octave ( C4 to C5 ) using each of these instruments from an online music sequencer CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Das , et al . Figure 5 : A sample weaving draft for a 2x2 twill pattern on the Simphony app . The threading sequence is 1234 repeated three times . The treadling sequence is 12 - 23 - 34 - 41 repeated three times . On the right , part of the control panel is shown enlarged . [ 5 ] . Additionally , weavers can choose colors for warp and weft from eight options ( red , green , blue , yellow , orange , pink , purple , and black ) that are frequently used at the community studio . Since pitch variation is widely used to indicate changes in suc - cessive data values [ 53 , 83 ] , Simphony maps numerical sequences onto musical notes with varying pitch . Each row in the threading sequence ( i . e . , shaft ) and each column in the treadling sequence ( i . e . , treadle ) is represented by a distinct musical note , with higher indexed shafts / treadles corresponding to a higher pitched note . In the tie - up table , columns and rows stand for treadles and shafts respectively . Here , each row ( shaft ) is denoted by a distinct note played on a piano , with the pitch increasing for higher indices . An - other audio parameter ( volume ) changes across columns , where the leftmost column ( treadle 1 ) has the highest value and the rightmost column has the lowest . In case of the drawdown , tapping any cell plays the C4 note in the instrument assigned for the warp or the weft , depending on which yarn is visible on the cell . Besides identifying individual shafts or treadles in a sequence , weavers can listen to the entire threading , treadling , or tie - up se - quences . For the threading sequence , corresponding notes for ac - tivated cells are played by column from right to left , following a common convention for reading weaving drafts . In the draft on Figure 5 , the warp ( yellow ) and the weft ( blue ) are denoted by piano and cello respectively . Simphony maps notes C4 , D4 , E4 , F4 , G4 , and A4 played on a piano onto shafts 1 - 6 and the same notes played on a cello onto treadles 1 - 6 . Thus , the musical representation for the threading sequence 1234 - 1234 - 1234 is CDEF - CDEF - CDEF , played on a piano . Unlike threading , multiple cells can be selected in a row ( i . e . , weft pick ) of a treadling sequence , which required us to modify the presentation technique for the entire sequence . In this case , notes for activated cells in a treadling sequence are played by row starting from top to bottom . Within each row , notes are played for the cells from left to right and a short blip earcon is inserted as a separator between adjacent rows . Playing the entire tie - up follows a similar process [ 107 ] . 6 . 1 . 2 Spoken Announcements and Customizable Modes . Based on feedback from the pilot session , we incorporated a ‘Verbal’ ( i . e . , spoken audio ) mode , in which single tapping a cell in a threading , treadling , or tie - up sequence reads out the shaft / treadle number of that particular cell and single tapping a cell in the drawdown reads out ‘ Warp ’ or ‘ Weft ’ to indicate which yarn is visible . In both ‘Verbal’ and ‘Musical’ ( i . e . , sonifed ) modes , selection / deselection of a cell by double tapping is confrmed with a spoken alert : ‘ Shaft 1 Warp 1 on / off ’ ( for threading ) , ‘ Treadle 1 Weft 1 on / off ’ ( for treadling ) , or ‘ Shaft 1 Treadle 1 tied - up / not tied - up ’ ( for tie - up ) . There is a ‘Verbosity’ control that allows weavers to shorten this spoken alert to ‘ on / off ’ or ‘ tied - up / not tied - up . ’ Simphony also enables a ‘Read’ mode where the cells become read - only i . e . , not editable , and only the activated cells play sound or spoken audio on being tapped while the empty cells remain silent . Spoken phrases were pre - generated using macOS text - to - speech feature with the voice profle Samantha ( US accent ) . Typically , a weaving draft shows all four panels ( threading , tread - ling , tie - up , and drawdown ) arranged together . However , consid - ering the needs of visually impaired weavers , Simphony allows people to separately interact with enlarged versions of individual panels . For the sake of simplicity , it currently supports creating patterns for a loom with 6 shafts and 6 treadles , with sequences up to 12 warp yarns or 12 weft picks long , resulting in a 12x12 drawdown . For our design exploration sessions , Simphony was deployed on a Windows Surface Pro 8 tablet . Simphony : Enhancing Accessible Patern Design Practices among Blind Weavers CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Figure 6 : Left : A wooden grid is secured on top of the tablet showing the enlarged threading sequence of a twill pattern on Simphony . Right : The same threading sequence is created with wooden blocks on a standalone grid . 6 . 2 Tangible Component : Wooden Grid with Blocks We brainstormed with interview participants about various alter - natives for an easily perceivable and manipulable tactile represen - tation of patterns ( Section 5 . 5 ) . Using refreshable tactile graphics displays [ 3 ] or 3D printers did not appear to be a sustainable so - lution for the community studio due to these devices’ prohibitive cost and the requirement of expert knowledge about specialized software ( e . g . , AutoCAD ) and hardware [ 90 ] . We deliberated over reappropriating a braille display to show patterns with raised pins . However , the limited real - estate on the display ( only 4 rows ) makes it challenging to perceive larger shapes [ 22 ] . Moreover , perceiving shapes on a braille display could be “a mind bend” ( Sara ) for braille readers because they would need to stop reading the raised pins as braille characters . Additionally , for weavers with reduced tactile sensation , the raised or lowered dots on the braille display or tactile graphics display could be “too small” to feel and thus , it would have been “very , very , very tricky” ( Helen ) to discern interlacement structures . Tactile image maker devices [ 6 ] could also be used to generate swelled - up versions of patterns that are manually drawn or printed onto heat - sensitive capsule papers , but weavers would still need a separate interface which would allow them to rapidly manipulate input sequences before deciding on desired patterns . Given these constraints , we chose to develop a low - tech tactile solution involving a wooden grid that can be secured on the tablet with two elastic bands ( and removed as needed ) . The design of the grid is informed by tactile overlays and 3D - printed keyguards that have been found useful for improving accessibility of touchscreen devices for people with motor or vision impairments [ 81 , 82 , 88 ] . The grid is laser - cut with holes through which a weaver can tap on the tablet and listen to auditory feedback . The 12x6 grid aligns with the enlarged views of the threading or treadling sequences on the Simphony app ( Figure 6 ) . Since the dimensions of individual cells in any sequence are the same , weavers can adjust the grid to align fully with the threading , treadling , or tie - up , and partially with the drawdown ( the entire drawdown can be explored part - by - part ) . To reduce chances of the grid sliding over the glass screen [ 81 ] , a thin Nitrile layer was attached underneath the grid that increased friction between the two surfaces . In addition , we made wooden blocks ( 13mm x 13mm ) that can be placed into the holes of the grid . The height of the blocks ( 6mm ) is double the height of the grid walls ( 3mm ) ; thus creating a raised surface when the blocks are put inside the grid holes . Besides working as a tactile overlay for the tablet app , the grid ( with wooden blocks ) can also be used as a standalone tangible display . We made two identical grids to be used simultaneously in both ways . After completing our study , we left the grid and blocks at the community studio so that weavers and instructors can continue using those for pattern design [ 65 ] . 7 DESIGN EXPLORATION : METHOD With approval from our feldsite and the Institutional Review Board of Northwestern University , we conducted eight design exploration sessions at the community weaving studio in May 2022 . 7 . 1 Participants Eight visually - impaired weavers and two sighted instructors took part in the design exploration sessions . Instructor Sara attended the sessions with Luke , Lisa , Tina , and Adam ; instructor Leah partici - pated with Jen and Paul ; and both instructors joined the sessions with Beth and Mark . This arrangement follows the typical work confguration at the studio where one or both instructors teach and assist weavers at a time . Recruitment and scheduling were done consulting with the instructors . All participants except Luke , Mark , and instructor Leah were involved in our formative interviews . Each session lasted 90 - 100 minutes . Once all the sessions were over , we conducted a 75 - minute debrief interview with the instructors . Participants were compensated with US $ 60 for each session they joined . Table 1 shows the details of participants . 7 . 2 Procedure We adopted a naturalistic workfow for the design exploration ses - sions and asked participants to fuidly adapt their course of actions as they deemed ft . The main activity across all sessions involved creating and exploring the threading , treadling , and drawdown for ‘2x2 twill , ’ a basic pattern that weavers create when they start learning . Our goal was not to measure blind weavers’ performance in designing patterns independently . Instead , taking an interdepen - dence perspective [ 14 , 96 , 129 ] , we aimed to uncover how blind weavers interact with sighted instructors and various materials in their workspace to learn , create , and make sense of fabric patterns and how technological augmentations reshape their collaborative work process and artistic expression . Each session started with obtaining participants’ verbal con - sent and collecting information about their familiarity with pattern design . No weavers were familiar with the term ‘drawdown’ al - though some had an understanding of treadling and / or threading . The instructors guided the weavers to understand these concepts by interacting with a loom positioned beside them ( Figure 7 , left ) . Instructors then explained diferent components and functionali - ties of Simphony . Per instructors’ suggestion , weavers frst created threading and treadling sequences of the twill pattern by arranging blocks in the wooden grid using it as a standalone tangible display . Next , they replicated these sequences on the digital application and listened to their auditory representations . Following this , weavers explored the drawdown for the twill pattern on the tablet , using the grid and blocks , and on a ‘macro sample’ instructors had cre - ated with felt strips prior to our sessions . Weavers also experienced the twill pattern on an actual fabric that we had selected from the inventory of the studio consulting with the instructors . However , weavers thought that the weft and warp and their interlacements CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Das , et al . Figure 7 : Left : Lisa explores the pattern on an actual fabric . The workspace shows a tablet with the Simphony app , two wooden grids , blocks , fabrics , and felt samples placed on a table . A loom is positioned between Lisa and Sara ( instructor ) . Right : Weaving drafts created by Tina ( diamond pattern ) and Luke ( scale pattern ) on Simphony . were “hard to separate” ( Mark ) on the felt macro sample and the ac - tual fabric . Hence , we primarily report fndings related to weavers’ interaction with the Simphony system in Section 8 . All sessions were video - recorded with two cameras . Throughout the sessions , we asked questions to the weavers in - the - moment to capture how they made sense of the new concepts , perceived the sequences they created , and conceptualized repetitive over - under arrangement of yarns and emergent shapes on the drawdowns . We concluded with debriefng questions regarding weavers’ reactions to the auditory and tactile features , probing them to refect on whether and how they might use Simphony for performing design activities at the studio , and ideas for further improvement . 7 . 3 Data Analysis We followed the refexive thematic analysis method [ 25 ] , which provided us a fexible way to holistically analyze various types of data [ 24 ] including interview transcripts , video recordings , and photographs captured . We started by reading and open - coding tran - scripts of verbal conversations while simultaneously reviewing the video recordings . Informed by Kafer’s [ 79 ] political / relational model of disability and other Disability Studies literature [ 62 , 77 , 101 , 131 ] , our analysis views disability and access as enacted through “partic - ular sociomaterial arrangement of relations” [ 97 ] and interdepen - dence between bodies , technologies , and the environment [ 14 , 33 , 96 , 132 ] . Further , we understand interaction as multimodal , embod - ied , and situated [ 58 , 71 , 122 , 123 ] and attend to how blind weavers developed shared meaning with sighted instructors and the sys - tem . While analyzing the video data [ 19 ] , we looked for salient interactions that captured , for example , blind weavers performing sequential exploration on Simphony , sighted instructors providing hand - over - hand guidance , and so on . Although we took short notes on all episodes of such interactions , we produced detailed memos for selected unique vignettes . For this , Das repeatedly watched certain video segments , writing down turns of events , timestamps , verbal and non - verbal interactions ( e . g . , hand postures , gestures ) , and au - ditory feedback from Simphony . Through iterative comparison of codes and data and regular discussion as a group , we constructed three overarching themes that described how blind weavers and sighted instructors used Simphony for generating patterns together . 8 DESIGN EXPLORATION : FINDINGS Below we detail how participants created and explored patterns with Simphony , the potential for the system to afect weaving in - struction and learning , and refections on what it means to partici - pate more fully in pattern design . 8 . 1 Creating and Exploring Patterns with Simphony For all eight weavers , our sessions were their very frst attempt at learning pattern design and interacting directly with a draft design - ing tool . Since these sessions were introductory , our participants’ primary goal was to successfully put down input sequences that would result in unique fabric patterns . Besides the twill pattern recommended by the instructors , several weavers laid out the draft for an additional pattern they decided on their own . Luke , Paul , and Tina opted for ‘scale , ’ ‘fower , ’ and ‘diamond’ patterns , respectively ( Figure 7 , right ) , while Mark and Adam chose specifc threading or treadling sequences ( e . g . , 1234321 ) instead of the outcome pattern . Below we describe how blind weavers used Simphony to create , explore , and understand these patterns . 8 . 1 . 1 Maintaining Awareness and Navigation . Generating weaving drafts requires weavers to develop moment - to - moment awareness of the design interface , their actions within it , and how these actions alter the system state . In graphical draft designing applications , sighted people can easily manipulate the selection of individual cells in the threading , treadling , or tie - up sequences and immediately observe how their actions modify those sequences and the resulting drawdown . Our blind participants engaged in a similar process where they learned to attend to the auditory cues from Simphony to identify their current position in a sequence and detect how their actions changed the state of individual cells ( on / of ) as well as the entire sequence . When navigating from cell to cell on the digital “fat” interface , blind weavers made use of the additional tactile cues they received from the wooden grid placed over the tablet . Luke explained , “Because of the tactile [ feedback ] . . . I know that I have moved over one [ cell ] because I’ve run into one of the [ grid ] walls . So , it makes interacting with the software , I’d say , possible at this point . ” Thus , the grid worked as a marker that helped weavers fnd their way around the complex design interface . Blind weavers also used auditory and tactile feedback to perform a synchronized routine of bimanual operation [ 13 , 85 , 92 , 99 ] for laying out weaving sequences . They located the next target cell with reference to their current position in a sequence and marked it using one hand as “a guide , ” while selecting / deselecting the cell with the other hand . When doing so , the audio cues helped weavers interpret whether they were on the right track or not . Consider the following vignette ( Figure 8 , left ) : ( Beth tapped shaft 6 of a column in her threading sequence ) Simphony : 6 . Beth : Oh my god ! We don’t want that . ( Started sliding fnger down the column while tapping each cell . ) Simphony : 5 . 4 . Beth : Okay okay . ( She was looking for shaft 4 and found it . ) Simphony : Enhancing Accessible Patern Design Practices among Blind Weavers CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Figure 8 : Left : Beth locates the next target cell in her thread - ing sequence , marks it with one fnger , and uses another fnger to select it . Right : Instructor Leah provides hand - over - hand support to Jen for locating a new starting point on her treadling sequence . As the above excerpt illustrates , blind weavers decoded the audio cues to fgure out if they had accidentally pressed a wrong cell and how they should operate next to get their desired sequence . Still sometimes they struggled with detecting the last cell they activated in a sequence or locating the next target cell , especially if they took their hand of the grid and “lost their place” ( Sara ) at any instance . In such cases , sighted instructors provided hand - over - hand guidance to help weavers “know where to start” ( Leah ) and orient themselves accordingly ( Figure 8 , right ) . Thus , blind weavers leveraged the complementary interplay of audio cues from the app , tactile feedback from the wooden grid , and embodied guidance from sighted instructors to maintain awareness of and navigate within the system . 8 . 1 . 2 Customizing Auditory Feedback . How blind weavers reacted to and customized auditory cues from Simphony depended on their personal preferences , skills , and contexts of use . Several weavers found spoken audio easier , straightforward , and “more accurate to read” ( Adam ) than sonifed representations . That is , translating sonifed data to corresponding shaft / treadle numbers might have incurred additional cognitive burden for these weavers [ 39 , 40 , 53 ] , given their lack of familiarity with the design concepts . Although several weavers preferred spoken audio ( Tina , Luke ) or wooden blocks ( Jen , Adam ) to formulate weaving sequences , all of them wanted to switch to the sonifed representation “to hear how it would sound in music . ” Disability experiences also shaped the way weavers made sense of audio cues . Mark who was hard - of - hearing preferred spoken audio , “because my ears don’t detect each note clearly enough . . . My [ cochlear ] implants weren’t designed for music . ” Unlike Mark , Lisa who also had hearing impairments preferred musical feedback to spoken audio . She explained , “I miss words so easily because I’m nerve deaf . . . Computerized speech is very hard for me , even though I’m wearing hearing aids . ” Instead , Lisa attended to the vibration caused by diferent instruments fowing through diferent parts of her body . She explained , “The warp . . . instrument ( saxophone ) vibra - tion came up right into my face . When I was hitting the weft , which was vibraphone , I could feel it right here ( pointing at her right hand ) — it’s like ZZZ - kt ZZZ - kt ! ” At the beginning of her session , Lisa tried out a number of instruments to determine the ones that would provide her with an optimal embodied sensation . Her profciency in playing instruments also made her “resonate better with mu - sic . ” As these examples demonstrate , how weavers comprehended Figure 9 : Left : Luke explores the drawdown for the ‘scale’ pattern on the Simphony app . Right : Jen runs both hands simultaneously over the wooden blocks arranged in the grid according to the drawdown for the ‘diamond’ pattern . and customized auditory cues was infuenced by their disability experiences as well as other aspects of their knowing and being . 8 . 1 . 3 Perceiving Repetition and Order in Paterns . Weaving sequences ( and the resultant drawdowns ) are formed by repetition of smaller units of interlacement structure in various orders and combina - tions ( e . g . , a diagonal repeated over and over again with upward or downward slope ) . Understanding and manipulating the order in which shafts ( and associated warp yarns ) get raised or lowered , how many adjacent warp yarns alternate with and foat over the weft , and what shape emerges and repeats in the fabric is critical to designing a draft . All these elements determine the appearance , stability , and ‘feel’ of a fabric . As such , one of our central goals was to uncover how blind weavers perceived the weaving drafts they laid out on Simphony and made sense of the repetition , order , and shapes appearing in these draft patterns . Although our sessions were the frst time blind weavers at the community studio tried to identify the lower - level details of patterns , weavers could de - termine the repetition and order of numbers ( or musical notes ) in threading and treadling sequences immediately after they listened to a sequence in full . For instance , upon listening to the musical representation of her threading sequence ( 1234 - 1234 ) , Lisa com - mented , “The progression of the sound . . . is repeating . It doesn’t go backwards . It stays in the same forward motion . CDEF - CDEF is what that is . And there’s a rhythm to that . ” This rhythm in the sonifed representation helped Lisa visualize the repetitive sequence . A more complex part of the design process involves identifying whether the warp is more prominent than the weft ( or vice versa ) on the drawdown—a property that alters the appearance , density , and ‘drape’ i . e . , fuidity of a fabric . Consider an example where Luke reasons through this aspect of pattern design . While reviewing the ‘scale’ pattern he recreated on Simphony—the same pattern he was weaving on an actual fabric at that time—Luke identifed that the drawdown exposed more wefts than warps in a particular region ( Figure 9 , left ) . Before using Simphony , he was under the impression that “the cloth [ showed ] mostly the warp with a line of weft . ” Later Luke realized his initial misunderstanding by paying attention to how many times the warp and weft instruments were repeated . He explained , “It was basically a process of disconfrming my belief . I knew that if what I thought was true , then it would be majority vibraphone ( warp instrument ) . As I went through , I’m just like , it seems to be much more guitar ( weft instrument ) . ” Thus , by experimenting with Simphony , Luke was able to comprehend the repetition of weft and warp yarns in the drawdown and better conceptualize how his fnal woven product would take shape . CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Das , et al . 8 . 1 . 4 Understanding Composite Paterns and Shapes . The resulting output from a specifc combination of input sequences on a draft is a unique shape or pattern on the drawdown . To comprehend shapes emerging on a drawdown , blind weavers sequentially ex - plored cells in a vertical , horizontal , or diagonal direction and then reconstructed shapes mentally from the audio cues they heard . For simple shapes like diagonal lines on a twill pattern , this process was relatively straightforward . However , many patterns result in complex and composite shapes that do not follow a straightforward , linear contour ( e . g . , diamond , oval ) and are difcult to conceptualize through sequentially aggregating audio cues only . To supplement weavers’ understanding from the audio cues , sighted instructors sometimes recreated the drawdowns with wooden blocks . Blind weavers felt that this presentation made the pattern “more tangi - ble , easier to keep track of . . . [ and ] feel the parallel pattern of warps and wefts with both hands” ( Mark ) . The tactile sensation weavers received from the blocks by exploring with both hands—although still sequentially—provided enhanced afordances for developing a mental imagery of the shape [ 29 , 112 ] . Interestingly , instructor Leah observed , “how the weavers oriented [ themselves ] when they’re tracing” a pattern and which direction they moved their fngers dur - ing exploration impacted their interpretation of emerging shapes [ 85 , 99 ] . For instance , when exploring the diamond pattern created with the wooden blocks , Jen described the shape as a cross ( ✝ ) , upon repeatedly moving both hands from left to right and bottom to top ( Figure 9 , right ) . Unlike such sequential exploration techniques adopted by the blind weavers , low - vision weavers ( Adam , Tina ) used their partial vision to scan the drawdown as a whole . This indicates the fundamental diferences in the ways blind , low - vision , and sighted weavers tracked patterns . One challenge we observed across the sessions was that the enlarged nature of the grid and blocks afected how weavers un - derstood shapes . Instructor Sara explained , “When you’re trying to build a shape with a bunch of squares , it’s gonna feel pixelated . ” Per - ceiving a shape that consists of smaller shapes ( i . e . , squared blocks ) is fundamentally diferent from perceiving a geometric shape that follows a continuous contour and is presented through , for example , a raised - line drawing [ 84 ] . Thus , identifying a shape on a weaving draft is not only about piecing together perceived information but also about flling out the gaps and mismatches in the perceived information . That’s why , for blind weavers , these emergent shapes were mostly open to individual interpretations , which sometimes did not match how sighted people visually perceived those , as also surfaced in our formative interviews ( Section 5 . 2 ) . In such cases , sighted instructors fuidly adapted their vocabulary and engaged in dialogic interaction [ 57 ] with blind weavers where both collabo - rators articulated how they understood a shape , considered each other’s perspectives , and made a bridge between individual inter - pretations of a shape and how that shape is traditionally described in weaving terms . During the debrief , Sara explained this process of shared meaning - making through reciprocal dialogues : “When people were describing it ( a diagonal pattern ) as a staircase or steps , it’s not wrong . And I tried to help them understand that they were correct in what they were observing . . . But it is something else too . It’s just , how are we looking at this ? And what is this on diferent scales ? ” That is , the scale and resolution ( e . g . , dimensions of a unit ) also impacted blind weavers’ perception of shapes in a pattern [ 103 ] . In summary , blind weavers used audio - tactile cues of Simphony to perceive interlacement structures and come up with unique in - terpretations of resulting shapes . Furthermore , they interacted with sighted instructors to recognize how their tactual interpretation of a pattern on the drawdown could difer from instructors’ visual description ( or even their own perception on a real fabric ) , and yet , be part of a shared meaning that they build together . 8 . 2 Transforming Learning and Instruction Processes Our analysis revealed that Simphony provided blind weavers with new modalities and vocabulary to learn , reconfrm , and retain com - plex weaving concepts . Further , the diverse interactions aforded by the digital and tangible components enabled instructors to cus - tomize their training strategies to suit weavers’ individual learning styles , interests , and aptitudes . 8 . 2 . 1 Learning and Solidifying Weaving Concepts . Since blind weavers at the studio did not directly engage in the design phase , many of them lacked precise knowledge about how their “physical actions of weaving” translated into patterned fabrics . By creating a “dig - ital woven fabric” frst - hand on the “computerized loom” ( as Lisa called Simphony ) , weavers felt that they were able to “appreciate what’s actually happening” when they performed weaving motions on a physical loom . Luke detailed how interacting with Simphony helped him decipher the underlying mechanisms of weaving . “I understand a little bit more about how the loom works from the demo . . . because this [ application ] is going to tell me which of those heddles is going up or down . And then on there ( pointing at the loom ) , that’s attached to the treadles that I’m manipulating directly . So , explor - ing it ( Simphony ) has made it easier to visualize both fractions going towards each other—the mechanics and the design . . . And the loom makes it all happen . ” Luke’s comment reveals several important insights . First , by ma - nipulating the selection or deselection of cells representing shafts in a sequence on the digital app , Luke gained a new knowledge that some heddles ( and associated warp yarns ) get raised when corresponding shafts are lifted . Second , by juxtaposing this new understanding with his prior knowledge from operating treadles on physical looms , he was able to comprehend the connection be - tween treadling and threading—that these two components are interlinked , physically and conceptually . Thus , by making use of Simphony as a “visualization tool , ” Luke was able to piece together what he experienced physically on the loom earlier in the session ( see Section 7 . 2 ) , what he learned by manipulating symbolic repre - sentations on the app , and his prior knowledge to form a coherent understanding of the principal mechanisms of weaving . Some weavers were able to apply the new concepts they learned during the design exploration sessions in their subsequent weav - ing activities . During the debrief interview , instructors recalled an instance where Mark was encountering a mechanical issue with the treadles on his loom and he referenced the concepts he learned from his interaction with Simphony to discuss and comprehend what caused the error . Thus , instructors felt that Simphony pro - vided themselves and blind weavers “more language” to talk about Simphony : Enhancing Accessible Patern Design Practices among Blind Weavers CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany the inner workings of a loom and “describe what’s happening with more than just words” ( Sara ) . Leah added , “Without this I wouldn’t be able to verbally explain [ the design process ] . . . It would be very difcult . ” These excerpts highlight the potential of Simphony as a scafolding tool that sighted instructors and blind weavers can utilize for teaching and learning foundations of weaving . 8 . 2 . 2 Facilitating Personalized Learning . Our analysis revealed that Simphony , with its customizable auditory and tactile features , en - abled new opportunities for personalized learning and teaching practices among blind weavers and sighted instructors . Instructor Sara commented , “Each of them is thinking about it ( pattern ) from a diferent perspective . And this tool was very helpful in uncover - ing those diferent perspectives . ” The session with Lisa presented a compelling example of this phenomenon . In her regular work , Lisa often “drew a blank” while memorizing treadling sequences in a numerical format , leading to errors in her weaving . In contrast , the material arrangement of wooden blocks helped Lisa better under - stand the sequence , where she could physically feel and manipulate the raised shape and what each individual treadle was doing [ 76 ] . She explained , “The numbers – sometimes I get confused . But if this [ grid ] was in front of me . . . that would stay [ in ] my mind as a visual , a mental loom . . . That’s why it clicked so well with the treadling se - quence . . . And I’ve been weaving for years but I’ve never seen it hit me right here . . . This made everything come alive . ” Besides the wooden blocks , participants thought that musical representations could be “an incredible aid” for weavers like Lisa who found it difcult to memorize abstract numbers and “instead think in a tune . ” Sighted instructors attended to how individual weavers reacted to various audio - tactile cues and attuned their teaching strategies accordingly . Sara explained , “How I was describing threading to Adam or Beth was totally diferent from how I would describe it to , say , Paul . . . To him ( Paul ) , it would mean nothing if I said CDEF ( mu - sical notes ) , but to Beth ( who had ‘perfect pitch’ recognition ability ) , that’s exactly what she heard and it made sense to her . ” Instructors also considered weavers’ comfort level with technologies while deciding if the tablet app “would be a good place for them to start or not . ” These excerpts indicate that Simphony helped instructors and weavers elicit common ground [ 32 , 55 ] , i . e . , mutual knowledge of what their collaborators understood so that they could leverage this knowledge to establish shared meaning in conversation and orchestrate learning and design activities accordingly . 8 . 3 Valuing Enhanced Engagement in Pattern Design To our participants , Simphony’s value moved beyond its efective - ness in supporting the process of generating and perceiving patterns and enabling new learning opportunities . Blind weavers also ap - preciated how they could leverage Simphony to take a more active role in the design phase alongside sighted instructors and fnd new avenues for artistic expression by combining music and weaving . On the whole , blind weavers enjoyed creating fabric patterns using Simphony , calling it as “a fun way to learn new things” ( Mark ) . The musical representation of weaving sequences , with timbre of diferent instruments and notes arranged in repetitive progression , engendered rich emotions among weavers . Listening to her thread - ing sequence played on an organ , Jen felt “like something exciting Figure 10 : Left : Adam creates a threading sequence inspired by the melody of ‘Happy birthday to you . ’ Right : Instructor Sara demonstrates Adam a drawdown that could possibly result from a threading sequence he created from the melody of ‘Mary had a little lamb . ’ is going to happen , ” whereas with the version played on a guitar , she did not feel “quite as much excitement . ” Paul noted his treadling sequence ( 343 - 212 - 343 - 212 ) as “relaxing , ” while Tina thought that her treadling sequence ( 12 - 23 - 34 - 41 ) “sounds like a happy , skipping song . ” Thus , blind weavers ascribed unique meanings to the weav - ing sequences—be it either memory of a song or the feeling that the song engendered—similar to the way they articulated personal narratives through their woven tapestries ( Section 5 . 1 ) . Several weavers commented that they would like to integrate Simphony “as a supplementary tool” at the beginning of their regular workfow to explore diferent patterns before committing to any particular design . Luke said , “This whole experience has made me much more hopeful that I can actually come up with my own stuf , in terms of patterns or unique fnal product , whereas it was just kind of a mystery . I didn’t know what was really possible . ” The sonifed presentation of weaving sequences also created op - portunities for weavers to develop a unique fusion of two diferent art forms that they participated in and evoked new artistic inspira - tion . As a telling example , Adam generated threading sequences inspired from the melodies of ‘Happy birthday to you’ and ‘Mary had a little lamb’ ( Figure 10 ) . To him , deciphering how a melody would come out in the form of a fabric pattern seemed like a “detec - tive work” for solving “a mystery . ” Like Adam , Lisa was enthusiastic about translating a song she composed herself into a fabric pattern . These weavers ( and also Luke ) ideated advanced ways of render - ing a song as a pattern – features that were not yet available on Simphony . They came up with the idea of representing multiple treadles activated in a single weft pick on the treadling sequence with musical chords , i . e . , multiple notes played simultaneously . Sim - ilarly , Lisa brainstormed with instructor Sara about denoting the duration of notes or chords in a song by having the weft “foat over” equivalent number of adjacent warp yarns . Weavers also envisioned Simphony to be an embodiment of performative art , through which they could present their work before an audience . Jen wanted to organize public exhibitions to encourage other disabled residents to get involved in pattern design . Lisa similarly planned for a syn - chronized orchestral performance , saying : “It could be done [ in ] a musical where you are weaving and . . . the song is turned into cloth . ” In this way , for blind weavers at the studio , Simphony opened up a pathway to foster their creative potentials by bridging the arts of music and weaving . Weavers’ desire to get more involved in pattern design , however , was not positioned from the perspective CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Das , et al . of achieving ‘independence . ’ Instead , they thought that designing on Simphony could lead to deeper collaboration with sighted in - structors . As an example , while creating a threading sequence , Paul invited Leah ( instructor ) to provide more embodied support , say - ing “Just drag my [ hand ] go like a mouse . . . tell me where to tap . ” Thus , even when learning new concepts and interacting with a new technology , blind weavers had agency in defning the boundaries of guidance they received from sighted instructors . Furthermore , weavers thought that Simphony could help them take a more active part in the setup steps that are typically done by the instructors . Paul envisioned using Simphony to “help out [ the instructors to ] . . . dress the loom , advance the loom . ” He wanted to have Simphony “incor - porated into the looms” to synchronize the ‘dressing’ routine ( a pre - processing step ) such that he would create and play threading sequences on the tablet while instructors would simultaneously lay out actual yarns on the loom and any mistakes in this process would be indicated with “a buzzer noise . ” Relatedly , Luke wanted to gener - ate designs that would be less labor - intensive for the instructors , since he did not “want to unduly burden” them . As these examples begin to illustrate , blind weavers desired to use Simphony not only for enjoyment and learning but also to uphold and strengthen their interdependent , “co - weaving” relationships with sighted instructors in ways that would allow them to be in a position of giving support instead of always being on the receiving end [ 14 , 37 , 118 ] . 9 DISCUSSION Below we synthesize fndings across our formative and design ex - ploration studies to critically refect upon how we might rethink multiplicity in understanding design within ability - diverse groups and what roles accessible technologies might play when incorpo - rated into traditional forms of making . 9 . 1 Towards Multiplicity in Understanding Pattern Design Creating accessible design tools requires understanding diferences in how people with diverse abilities process information . In our study , we observed how blind and low - vision weavers and sighted instructors interpreted emergent shapes in fabric patterns difer - ently due to the fundamental diferences in visual , auditory , and tac - tile perception , echoing fndings in other domains [ 29 , 84 , 92 , 112 ] . Low - vision weavers and sighted instructors adopted a global ap - proach by visually scanning the whole pattern and tracking the contour of emergent shapes . In contrast , blind weavers explored patterns sequentially by moving in a horizontal , vertical , or diago - nal direction while attending to the auditory cues by tapping cells on the app or touching the grid with blocks . Weavers’ methods of exploration [ 13 , 85 , 99 ] , lived experiences with disabilities , and musical and mathematical knowledge , all infuenced their “part - to - whole” comprehension of shapes [ 29 , 63 , 90 , 92 , 112 ] . However , expert blind weavers and sighted instructors emphasized that the goal is not to identify one ‘correct’ way of describing a pattern . The same woven pattern can lead to diferent understandings among blind , low vision , and sighted weavers based on their past experi - ence and whether they explore a pattern on the tablet , with the blocks , on a fabric , or woven felt strips . Given this , Simphony il - lustrates the value of design tools that support a “multiplicity of meanings” [ 46 , p . 167 ] rather than promoting a singular understand - ing of patterns that are rooted only in sighted ways of knowing . Moreover , understandings of pattern did not happen through technology or the material environment alone but through a collec - tive process involving both blind and sighted collaborators . Blind weavers demonstrated sighted instructors how they “made a cross ( shape ) with her hands” ( Leah ) while running fngers over the blocks or tapping tablet cells . Instructors , in turn , guided the weavers along the contour of a shape they perceived visually through verbal ex - planations and / or hand - over - hand support . Our analysis highlights the mutual “care work” [ 18 , 101 ] that makes such co - construction of meaning possible , in which both parties negotiated the boundaries of agency and assistance . Indeed , we observed instances when blind weavers decided whether or not they would like to receive more hand - over - hand guidance from sighted instructors in perceiving patterns . Bennett et al . [ 18 ] caution , however , that “even to care for another’s access in a sight - dominant world—is to exert a politics , a politics for example of who has the authority to decide what bodies should guide other bodies . . . ” Therefore , while foregrounding care work to enable shared meaning - making , we must be mindful of the possibilities of “non - innocent authorization of care” [ 18 ] , given that instructors’ position as sighted people with mastery of weaving knowledge creates a power asymmetry and puts them in the role of a caregiver and guide . 9 . 2 Accessible Design Technology as a Scafold for Learning Our analysis extends prior literature that integrates craftwork and interactive technologies ( e . g . , [ 8 , 9 , 20 , 43 , 52 , 54 , 114 , 115 ] ) by diving deeper into what it means to build an accessible design tool for making and crafting . In particular , we highlight how technologies can scafold learning complex procedures for blind crafters , such as the underlying calculus of woven structures . Generating pattern drafts is a complicated task that requires hands - on learning and practice , and even then , it can take years to master . Despite weaving for a long time , many blind weavers at the community studio found it difcult to grasp how their physical actions on the loom resulted in unique fabric patterns , partly due to their limited involvement in the design phase . In this regard , creating and exploring patterns frst - hand on Simphony helped weavers learn and fll the gaps in their previous understanding of weaving concepts . Indeed , by reproducing the pattern he was weaving for his then active project , Luke was able to “disconfrm [ his prior ] belief” and develop new perspectives on the look and feel of the resulting pattern . For weavers like Lisa , who understood concepts better through metaphors and music—due to their exper - tise in music theory—Simphony formed the much needed “link” between abstract numerical sequences and what the sequence actu - ally meant for weaving . Thus , Simphony supported weavers who needed “more than just words’ ’ for learning pattern design . The variety of representations introduced in Simphony , i . e . , spoken au - dio , musical notes , instruments , colors , and tactile blocks , helped blind weavers and sighted instructors unveil individual learning styles and adapt their use of the interface to personalize the learn - ing experience . Even when Simphony was “faded out” [ 104 ] , i . e . , removed from the workspace , Mark was able to retain and apply his Simphony : Enhancing Accessible Patern Design Practices among Blind Weavers CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany understanding from the interaction with Simphony to troubleshoot an error he was encountering during a regular weaving session . Thus , technologies like Simphony could enable accessible ways of skill - building among blind learners . This fnding aligns with prior work that built scafolding systems for learning scientifc concepts [ 48 ] , programming [ 113 ] , and everyday activities [ 134 ] among dis - abled children , but here we see that digital technologies can also be integrated as a scafold in manual forms of making and crafting . 9 . 3 Accessible Technology as an Augmentation for Aesthetics and Performative Art For our blind participants , fabrics are not only the outcomes of their weaving activities but also embodiment of their artistic thinking and imagination . Integrating Simphony into their workfow further prompted weavers to reimagine ways to break the boundaries be - tween diferent art forms and add new dimensions to their fber arts practices [ 20 ] . Not only colors and textures of yarns but now the sequences of weaving , with their unique musical progressions and instrumental presentation on Simphony , equipped blind weavers with new resources that they could manipulate to imbue fabrics with meaning . As an example , Adam inscribed melodies into his patterns by formulating threading sequences that followed note progressions of those melodies . Although prior work has explored how disabled people could track and display their moods by altering the form of textile swatches prepared by researchers [ 98 ] , our work illustrates how blind weavers made use of Simphony to encode their emotions , stories , and favorite compositions into patterns through unique combinations of weaving sequences . Previous work has investigated the performative potentials of fabrication [ 45 ] and crafting among sighted artists ( e . g . , SoundWeav - ing [ 125 ] and BeatWoven [ 70 ] ) . Our analysis , in contrast , centers the experiences of blind crafters and demonstrates how an acces - sible design tool like Simphony can move past its role as a mere functional aid and open up new avenues of performative art for blind people , evidenced by Jen , Luke , and Lisa wanting to perform musical renditions of their fabric patterns before an audience . This insight draws parallels to the ways disabled artists have explored technological and material augmentations to their assistive devices for performative art [ 12 ] , for instance , by adapting a navigational cane as an instrument [ 128 ] and a ramp for wheelchair dance [ 105 ] . 9 . 4 Limitations and Future Work Our study is grounded in the needs and practices of this particu - lar community studio where blind weavers work with and learn from sighted instructors . Although Simphony incorporates various audio - tactile cues to improve accessibility , it builds on visual render - ing of patterns as done in traditional weaving drafts [ 72 ] and digital pattern drafting applications [ 2 , 7 ] ( e . g . , by using colors in 2D grids ) . In this sense , our system also reinforces a vision - centric framing of pattern design . Future work should explore alternative non - visual ways of designing patterns ( e . g . , fully tangible systems or interac - tive textual descriptions [ 138 ] ) to support blind weavers who work independently or teach other blind / sighted learners . Furthermore , we purposefully chose to develop a relatively low - cost solution in - cluding a digital application with a wooden grid and blocks instead of using more sophisticated and expensive devices . Future research may implement other emerging technologies such as refreshable tactile graphics displays [ 21 , 103 , 108 ] or 2 . 5D interactive shape displays [ 117 ] for accessible pattern design . Also , while we chose simple sonifcation techniques such as changing pitch and timbre to explore blind weavers’ initial reactions to non - speech audio for representing patterns , future work may incorporate other auditory techniques like spearcons [ 78 ] and musicons [ 93 ] . Future work could also examine ways to generate complex patterns that span longer threading and treadling sequences and a higher number of shafts / treadles . For this , a ‘panning’ approach [ 21 ] could be adopted to demonstrate longer sequences or drawdowns part - by - part . 10 CONCLUSION This study set out to enhance accessible pattern design practices within a community of blind weavers and their sighted instructors . Building upon our formative interviews , we developed Simphony , an audio - tactile system that incorporates a variety of sonifcation techniques , synthesized speech , a tactile overlay and wooden blocks to support blind weavers in generating and perceiving fabric pat - terns . Our design exploration study revealed the ways in which blind weavers made use of Simphony to create weaving sequences and understand interlacement structures and emerging shapes in fabric patterns . Through this , blind weavers also developed engag - ing and personalized learning opportunities with sighted instruc - tors and reimagined artistic and aesthetic values of weaving . These insights encourage us to rethink what collaborative understanding of patterns constitutes in ability - diverse design teams and what roles technologies might play in transforming learning and access in collaborative making and crafting .
