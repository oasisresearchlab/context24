Here , we present an analysis of CME in the human fungal pathogen Candida albicans that shows the same modular structure as those in other fungi and mammalian cells . Intriguingly , C . albicans is perfectly viable in the absence of Arp2 / 3 , an essential component of CME in other systems . In C . albicans , Arp2 / 3 function remains essential for CME as all 15 proteins tested that participate in CME , including clathrin , lose their characteristic dynamics observed in wild - type ( WT ) cells . However , since arp2 / 3 cells are still able to endocytose lipids and ﬂuid - phase markers , but not the Ste2 and Mup1 plasma membrane proteins , there must be an alternate clathrin - independent pathway we term Arp2 / 3 - independent endocytosis ( AIE ) . Characterization of AIE shows that endocytosis in arp2 mutants relies on actin cables and other Arp2 / 3 - independent actin structures , as inhibition of actin functions prevented cargo uptake in arp2 / 3 mutants . Transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) showed that arp2 / 3 mu - tants still formed invaginating tubules , cell structures whose proper functions are believed to heavily rely on Arp2 / 3 . Finally , Prk1 and Sjl2 , two proteins involved in patch disassembly during CME , were not correctly localized to sites of endocytosis in arp2 mutants , implying a role of Arp2 / 3 in CME patch disassembly . Overall , C . albicans contains an alternative endocytic path - way ( AIE ) that relies on actin cable function to permit clathrin - independent endocytosis ( CIE ) and provides a system to further explore alternate endocytic routes that likely exist in fungal species . IMPORTANCE There is a well - established process of endocytosis that is generally used by eukaryotic cells termed clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) . Although the details are somewhat different between lower and higher eukaryotes , CME appears to be the dominant endocytic process in all eukaryotes . While fungi such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae have proven excellent models for dissecting the molecular details of endocytosis , loss of CME is so detrimental that it has been difﬁcult to study alter - nate pathways functioning in its absence . Although the fungal pathogen Candida albicans has a CME pathway that functions similarly to that of S . cerevisiae , inactivation of this pathway does not compromise growth of yeast - form C . albicans . In these cells , lipids and ﬂuid - phase molecules are still endocytosed in an actin - dependent manner , but membrane proteins are not . Thus , C . albicans provides a powerful model for the analysis of CME - independent endocytosis in lower eukaryotes .

E ndocytosis is a fundamental mechanism cells employ both to capture macromolecules from the extracellular environment and to selectively recycle and internalize membrane lipids and membrane - bound proteins ( 1 , 2 ) . One of the ﬁrst described en - docytic pathways is clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) ( 3 ) . Today , CME is well characterized and has been identiﬁed as evo - lutionarily conserved from humans to fungi . Molecular mecha - nisms governing CME have been elucidated in great detail with the help of live - cell , multicolor ﬂuorescent microscopy tech - niques . Studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae as well as in mamma - lian cells have shaped the picture of CME as a highly coordinated process in which more than 60 proteins cooperate to drive vesicle internalization ( 4 ) . In mammalian cells , these proteins are grouped into 7 functional modules , while S . cerevisiae has 5 such functional modules ( 5 – 7 ) . The 5 modules in S . cerevisiae are ( i ) the early module , ( ii ) the coat module , ( iii ) the Wiskott - Aldrich syn - drome protein / myosin ( Myo / WASP ) module , ( iv ) the actin mod - ule , and ( v ) the scission ( or amphiphysin ) module ( 4 , 8 – 12 ) . During CME in yeast , Syp1 of the early module is among the ﬁrst proteins to arrive at the nascent endocytic site ( 12 , 13 ) . The elements of the coat module arrive next—ﬁrst clathrin followed by other coat components like Sla2 ( a homologue of mammalian HIP1 - R ) and the EH - domain proteins End3 and Pan1 ( 14 , 15 ) . Collectively , thefunctionsofclathrin , End3 , Pan1 , andSla2aspart of the early and coat modules include , respectively , initial mem - brane bending and linking coat components to the actin cytoskel - eton . The Myo / WASP module arrives subsequently ; this includes Vrp1 ( the yeast WIP homologue ) and several Arp2 / 3 complex RESEARCH ARTICLE September / October 2013 Volume 4 Issue 5 e00476 - 13 ® mbio . asm . org 1 activators , like Las17 ( the yeast WASP homologue ) and type I myosins ( Myo3 and Myo5 ) . The actin module is recruited next and includes in part actin , Arp2 / 3 , Cap1 and Cap2 ( two capping proteins ) , the ﬁmbrin Sac6 ( an actin - bundling protein ) , Abp1 ( an actin binding protein ) , two kinases ( Prk1 and Ark1 ) that regulate endocytic proteins , and the phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate phosphatase Sjl2 ( 5 , 16 , 17 ) . Together , the compo - nents of the actin module orchestrate the completion of an endo - cytic event ( in concert with the scission module ) . Speciﬁcally , the function of the Arp2 / 3 - mediated branched actin network is pro - posed to provide the force that together with type I myosin motor activity extends vesicle invagination ( 15 , 18 ) . As the nascent en - docytic vesicle invaginates , facilitated by the dynamin - like protein Vps1 , two amphiphysins ( Rvs161 and Rvs167 ) of the scission module are recruited and help release the vesicle , which then traf - ﬁcs along actin ﬁlaments to ultimately fuse with endosomes ( 19 – 22 ) . InadditiontoourdetailedunderstandingofCME , recentstud - ies have started to examine alternate pathways that do not rely on clathrin . Examples of such clathrin - independent endocytosis ( CIE ) are found in Caenorhabditis elegans , Drosophila melano - gaster , and mammalian cells ( 23 – 25 ) . The functions of CIE in - clude endocytosis of membrane and ﬂuids , which can reach up to 70 % of the endocytic capacity of a cell ( 26 – 28 ) . In fungi , however , it was not clear whether CIE exists , as CME was long thought to be the sole endocytic route ( 29 ) . However , one recent report has described a Rho1 - dependent pathway in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that seems to be clathrin independent ( 30 ) . Conve - niently , the fungal pathogen Candida albicans has the potential to functionally and unambiguously separate different endocytic pathways . In C . albicans , robust endocytosis occurs in the absence of one key player that drives CME , the Arp2 / 3 complex ( 31 ) . Thus , this molecularly manipulable dimorphic fungus can allow the study of different endocytic processes ; such alternate endocytic pathways may be important in a human fungal pathogen that needs to recycle damaged plasma membrane and cell wall compo - nents to cope with the plasma membrane and cell - wall - targeting drugs used to treat patients in hospitals . In this study , we investigate Arp2 / 3 - independent endocytosis ( AIE ) and CME in C . albicans . We ﬁrst establish that in C . albicans , CME is driven by an equivalent modular design , with individual proteins showing functional similarities compared to other fungal systems . We then provide evidence that AIE does not rely on any of the functional modules involved in CME , including clathrin . Furthermore , AIE differs from CME in that two plasma mem - brane ( PM ) proteins are not endocytosed , suggesting a cargo - speciﬁc role of AIE versus CME . We further provide evidence that actin cables are important for endocytosis during AIE . Finally , using electron microscopy ( EM ) to visualize invaginating tubules , our data show that these structures still form in the absence of Arp2 / 3 , raising the possibility that AIE could rely on Arp2 / 3 - independent invaginating tubule formation to take up cargo . Col - lectively , our data identify novel features of a CIE pathway ( AIE ) in C . albicans and lay the groundwork to further elucidate how endocytosis works without Arp2 / 3 . RESULTS Analysis of CME in C . albicans . We initially investigated whether CME works in a modular design in C . albicans similar to that in S . cerevisiae . To do this , we recorded the dynamics of green ﬂuo - rescent protein ( GFP ) - tagged proteins at every stage of the CME pathway using high - speed spinning - disk confocal or total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy ( see Movie S1 in the supplemental material ) . We then applied several forms of quanti - tative motion analysis to assess CME ; we measured the mean square displacement ( MSD ) of GFP signals over time , calculated the percentage of patches that left the origin ; determined the av - erage lateral track displacement within the plane of the plasma membrane ( from now on referred to as “average track displace - ment length” ) , and established the average track duration time ( Fig . 1 and 2 ) . Syp1 represents one of the earliest components of CME in yeast . Analysis in C . albicans similarly showed that when Arp2 / 3 was present , Syp1 of the early module had an average track displacement length of 0 . 08 (cid:1) m ( standard deviation [ SD ] , (cid:1) 0 . 05 (cid:1) m ) and an average track duration of 101 s ( SD , (cid:1) 60 s ) and that 86 % of Syp1 signals left the origin . The coat components analyzed ( Sla2 , Pan1 , and End3 ) showed an initial stationary phase followed by a mobile phase when patches moved away from the membrane . The average track du - rations varied and ranged from 66 (cid:1) 22 s ( Sla2 ) and 63 (cid:1) 30 s ( End3 ) to 36 (cid:1) 11 s ( Pan1 ) , while the average track displacement length and the percentage of patches leaving the origin were sim - ilar for all coat components , with displacement lengths of 0 . 20 (cid:1) 0 . 12 (cid:1) m ( Pan1 ) , 0 . 22 (cid:1) 0 . 12 (cid:1) m ( End3 ) , and 0 . 32 (cid:1) 0 . 18 (cid:1) m ( Sla2 ) and at least 97 % of patches leaving the origin . The average track duration for Myo / WASP components varied between 13 (cid:1) 5 s ( Myo5 and Vrp1 ) and 31 (cid:1) 23 s ( Wal1 ) , with all components showing similar average track displacement lengths , which were 0 . 07 (cid:1) 0 . 03 (cid:1) m ( Vrp1 ) , 0 . 07 (cid:1) 0 . 05 (cid:1) m ( Myo5 ) , and 0 . 08 (cid:1) 0 . 05 (cid:1) m ( Wal1 ) , and with 100 % of patches leaving the origin . The actin module components showed average track durations and average track displacement lengths for Cap2 , Cap1 , Sac6 , and Abp1 of 11 (cid:1) 4 , 13 (cid:1) 5 , 16 (cid:1) 6 , and 20 (cid:1) 8 s , and 0 . 38 (cid:1) 0 . 19 , 0 . 41 (cid:1) 0 . 27 , 0 . 45 (cid:1) 0 . 30 , and 0 . 49 (cid:1) 0 . 24 (cid:1) m , respectively . All ob - served patches left the origin . Sjl2 and Prk1 had average track durations of 10 (cid:1) 6 and 15 (cid:1) 6 s , respectively . Average track displacements were 0 . 38 (cid:1) 0 . 26 (cid:1) m for Sjl2 and 0 . 41 (cid:1) 0 . 23 (cid:1) m for Prk1 , and all Sjl2 and Prk1 spots left the origin . Finally , Rvs167 of the scission module showed an average track duration of 5 (cid:1) 2 s and average displacement length of 0 . 15 (cid:1) 0 . 10 (cid:1) m , with 100 % of observed Rvs167 signals disappearing from the origin . Overall , the analysis showed that , in the presence of Arp2 / 3 , CME components display similar dynamic characteristics and a modular design as observed in other fungal and mammalian spe - cies , thus emphasizing the conservation of CME among eu - karyotes . EndocytosiscanoccurintheabsenceofArp2 / 3 . Wehavepre - viously demonstrated that arp2 / 3 mutants are viable in C . albicans ( 31 ) . Here , we used these deletion mutants to study Arp2 / 3 - independent endocytosis ( AIE ) . We began by testing whether CME components are still functional without Arp2 / 3 . For Syp1 , the average track displacement length was 0 . 04 (cid:1) 0 . 03 (cid:1) m , the averagetrackdurationwas (cid:2) 120s ( 128swasthemaximumlength of observation ) , and no Syp1 signals disappeared ( see Fig . 1 and 2 ; see Movie S1 in the supplemental material ) . Components of the coatmoduleandtheMyo / WASPmodulecorrectlylocalizedtothe plasma membrane but remained static and did not cycle off the membrane , demonstrating that losing Arp2 / 3 complex function has a profound impact on these early modules . Imaging of actin patches in arp2 cells was more difﬁcult as the Epp et al . 2 ® mbio . asm . org September / October 2013 Volume 4 Issue 5 e00476 - 13 same patch signal tended to drift in and out of the focal plane . Consequently , it was unclear whether patches internalized or whether they showed increased lateral movement along the mem - brane . We therefore analyzed patch behavior of actin module components in arp2 mutants by recording 20 z stacks over time . This demonstrated that more than 70 % of patches move at least 100 nm from where they were ﬁrst detected , with an average dis - placement length of 0 . 27 (cid:1) 0 . 27 (cid:1) m ( Cap2 ) , 0 . 20 (cid:1) 0 . 17 (cid:1) m ( Cap1 ) , 0 . 43 (cid:1) 0 . 45 (cid:1) m ( Sac6 ) , and 0 . 29 (cid:1) 0 . 34 (cid:1) m ( Abp1 ) . Importantly , almost all patches in arp2 mutants were detected during the entire length of observation ( 128 s ) and did not appear to internalize , which is in stark contrast to WT cells , where nearly 100 % of patch signals internalized ( Fig . 2 ; see Movie S1 in the supplemental material ) . The number of patches was reduced in arp2 cells more than 4 - fold with usually 20 or less Cap1 , Cap2 , Sac6 or Abp1 GFP signals present . These signals frequently ap - peared as actin ﬁlament - like structures , suggesting that the signals may be remnants of nonfunctional patches , thus supporting the view that Arp2 / 3 is instrumental for the proper movement and turnover of the tested actin patch module components . Similar actin ﬁlament structures have previously been observed in various CME - deﬁcient S . cerevisiae strains ( 18 , 32 , 30 ) . Analyzing patch dynamics for Prk1 , Rvs161 , and Sjl2 was not possible in arp2 mutants as Prk1 and Rvs161 were not clearly localized to any structures and Sjl2 appeared associated with ﬁlamentous - like structures ( see Movie S1 in the supplemental material ; data for Rvs161 not shown ) . Finally , only 14 . 6 % of Rvs167 spots disappeared from the origin , with the remaining 85 . 4 % of signals staying stationary at the membrane . The few spots ( 14 . 6 % ) that disappeared in arp2 cells showed WT - like FIG1 CMEisheavilyaffectedwithoutArp2 / 3 . DynamicsofGFP - taggedcomponentsateverystageofCMEwererecordedinlivecellsbyspinning - diskconfocal microscopy and quantitatively analyzed . Recorded displacement data of individual patches ( n (cid:2) 20 ) were aligned at the start of their lifetime and then averaged . MSD plots for WT cells were truncated at the time when 50 % of spots have disappeared , corresponding to the median lifetime . For mutant cells , MSD plots represent the ﬁrst 70 s of recording . Components of the early ( A ) , coat ( B ) , Myo / WASP ( C ) , actin ( D ) , and scission ( E ) module show dynamic behavior in WT cells . In arp2 cells , early , coat , and Myo / WASP components lost dynamics and remained static at the plasma membrane , while some actin module as well as scission module components retained partial dynamics in arp2 mutants . Prk1 and Sjl2 did not localize to any clear patch structures , and the dynamics could not be quantitatively analyzed in arp2 cells . The results for WT cells are in blue , and those for arp2 cells are in red . MSD plots correspond to means (cid:1) SEM . See Movies S1 and S2 in the supplemental material . Arp2 / 3 - Independent Endocytosis in Candida albicans September / October 2013 Volume 4 Issue 5 e00476 - 13 ® mbio . asm . org 3 tracking durations , but when all Rvs167 signals were averaged , the track duration and track displacement length for Rvs167 were (cid:2) 111 (cid:1) 27 s and 0 . 08 (cid:1) 0 . 08 (cid:1) m in arp2 cells , respectively , indicating that the scission module is heavily affected . Remarkably , when imaging GFP cou - pled to clathrin light chain ( Clc1 ) in the absence of Arp2 / 3 , we found that clathrin existed in two populations : one remained static at the membrane and in the vast majority of cases ( (cid:2) 95 % , n (cid:2) 200 ) was detected during the entire time of obser - vation ( 128 s ) , while the second clathrin population appeared intracellular and re - tained dynamics similar to those of the WT cells . In order to further establish whether clathrin is involved in AIE , we observed Clc1 by TIRF microscopy in arp2 cells . Time - lapse movies over 6 min ( see Movie S2 in the supplemental ma - terial ) conﬁrmed the spinning - disk microscopy observations above that membrane - bound clathrin remains static at the membrane in arp2 cells and does not internalize , suggesting that the clath - rin light chain is dispensable for AIE at the plasma membrane . Overall , our detailed analysis of CME in the absence of Arp2 / 3 demonstrated that the CME pathway is dramatically af - fected , with most components , including clathrin , completely losing their func - tionality at sites of endocytosis . This sug - gests that any cargo uptake in AIE must follow a clathrin - independent endocytic pathway in C . albicans . Ste2 and Mup1 PM proteins are not endocytosedthroughAIEin C . albicans . In mammalian cells , different CIE path - ways are cargo speciﬁc . In C . albicans , AIE allows endocytosis of lipids and ﬂuids ( 31 ) , but it was unclear whether AIE is capable of internalizing PM proteins . To test this , we used the GFP - labeled phero - mone receptor Ste2 as a marker for receptor - mediated endocytosis . While the GFP - signal disappeared from the membrane in WT cells after 40 min of pheromone induction , the signal re - mained stable at the membrane in the ab - sence of Arp2 / 3 ( Fig . 3A ) . When we used a second inducible marker for PM pro - tein endocytosis , the methionine per - mease Mup1 , we found the same results : no GFP signal was detected at the plasma membrane in WT cells after addition of methionine , but signals persisted at the membrane in the absence of Arp2 / 3 ( Fig . 3B ) . To rule out that the vacuolar FIG 2 Arp2 / 3 is required for productive functioning of CME . Live - cell imaging data were analyzed for three additional quantitative elements to demonstrate that CME becomes nonproductive without Arp2 / 3 . ( A ) The percentage of patches ( n (cid:2) 20 ) leaving the origin was deﬁned in two ways ; patches that disappeared ( applied for the early , coat , Myo / WASP , and scission modules ) and patches that moved more than 100 nm from the sites of ﬁrst detection ( applied for the actin module ) . In a few cases , Pan1 and End3 patches disappeared in arp2 cells , which likely correspond to patches moving out of the focal plane . ( B ) Track displacement length measures the distance between ﬁrst and last patch detection , in arp2 cells corresponding to a maximum of 128 s . ( C ) Track duration refers to how long a patch was observed over a 2 - min period . All graphs are expressed as means (cid:1) SD . Epp et al . 4 ® mbio . asm . org September / October 2013 Volume 4 Issue 5 e00476 - 13 background staining observed in the Ste2 and Mup1 assays was not camouﬂaging minor uptake capacities in the absence of Arp2 / 3 , we developed pHluorin ( 34 ) for use in C . albicans . pHluo - rin is a pH - sensitive GFP variant that is detected at cytosolic pH but not at the lower pH in the vacuole ( 35 ) . Mup1 - pHluorin dis - appeared completely in WT cells after 60 min of incubation , while Mup1 - pHluorin was still detected at the plasma membrane in cells lacking Arp2 / 3 , even after extended overnight incubation pe - riods ( see below ) . Because a recent study suggested that relieving turgor pressure by providing osmotic support reduces the requirement for actin during endocytosis in S . cerevisiae ( 36 ) , we grew the Arp2 / 3 - deﬁcient cells in the presence of 1 . 5 M sorbitol to test whether this can suppress defects in PM protein endocytosis . As well , based on a report showing that increased Rho1 activity suppresses PM pro - tein endocytosis in S . cerevisiae adaptor mutants ( ENT1 , ENT2 , Yap1801 , and Yap1802 ) ( 30 ) , we hypothesized that overexpres - sionofthefunctionalhomologof S . cerevisiae Rho1pin C . albicans ( CaRho1p ) might allow Mup1 endocytosis in Arp2 / 3 mutants ( 37 ) . While quantitative PCR ( qPCR ) analysis showed that we could overexpress the C . albicans RH01 ( CaRHO1 ) message 8 . 5 - fold in arp2 cells , no difference in substrate uptake was observed in the presence of either this CaRho1 overexpression , of osmotic support , or of a combination of the two in terms of Mup1 - pHluorin endocytosis in arp2 mutants , even after extended over - night incubations ( Fig . 3B ) . These results show that not every cargo ( e . g . , Ste2 and Mup1 PM proteins ) is endocytosed through AIE in C . albicans . Actin cable dynamics are not blocked in the absence of Arp2 / 3 . Studies in fungal cells suggest that CIE relies on actin cables ( 30 ) . Therefore , to investigate whether actin cables and other Arp2 / 3 - independent actin structures play a role during AIE in C . albicans , we ﬁrst addressed whether actin dynamics are af - fected during AIE in C . albicans . In order to visualize the actin cytoskeleton in live cells , we expressed LIFEACT - GFP ( 38 ) in WT cells , which labeled actin patches and cables , while in arp2 / 3 mu - tants , no actin patches were observed . In general , two populations of actin cables were observed in WT and arp2 cells : long cables that elongated and depolymerized and shorter , fast - moving cables that did not appear to grow or shrink . The ﬁrst actin cable population was observed in small and midsize budded cells , originating at the bud neck and elongating toward the mother cell along the polarity axis . Cable depolymerization proceeded in the same direction , starting from the bud neck toward the mother cell . The rates of actin polymerization for long actin cables were similar in the WT ( 0 . 20 (cid:1) 0 . 07 (cid:1) m / s ) and arp2 mutants ( 0 . 22 (cid:1) 0 . 04 (cid:1) m / s , n (cid:2) 10 in each case ) . In addition to these long cables that usually span from the bud neck to the distal side of the cell , a second population of actin cables was observed that were typically short , originating from different places and moving almost twice as fast as long ca - bles polymerized ; 0 . 47 (cid:1) 0 . 13 (cid:1) m / s for WT and 0 . 49 (cid:1) 0 . 12 (cid:1) m / s for arp2 cells ( n (cid:2) 10 ) ( Fig . 4 ; see Movie S3 in the supplemental material ) . These observations corroborate previous ﬁndings of actin ﬁlament dynamics in WT cells of S . cerevisiae ( 39 ) . Together , our data demonstrate that actin cable dynamics are not dramatically affected in the absence of Arp2 / 3 . However , we did observe that actin cables appeared less oriented and often dis - organized , with cables frequently aligning perpendicularly to the polarity axis in arp2 cells ( not shown ) . Overall , this analysis sug - gests that actin cables retain function in the absence of the Arp2 / 3 complex during AIE in C . albicans . Cargo uptake is actin dependent during AIE . To investigate directly whether actin structures are involved in lipid endocytosis ( FM4 - 64 uptake ) during AIE , we blocked actin dynamics with cytochalasin A ( CA ) . Because CA completely abolished all ﬂuores - cent signals in arp2 mutants carrying LIFEACT - GFP , while WT cells were more resistant and showed nonmotile actin patches at the membrane ( Fig . 5A ) , we performed the following experiments with arp2 cells only . We blocked actin dynamics and then added FM4 - 64 , washed all nonadherent dye away , and chased dye inter - nalization while CA ( or dimethyl sulfoxide [ DMSO ] for control cultures ) was continuously present , before blocking endocytosis . This procedure showed that , whereas 95 % of control cells treated with DMSO had FM4 - 64 internalization and showed a clear vac - uolar staining , none of the CA - treated cells showed dye uptake . In most cases , the dye appeared evenly distributed at the plasma FIG 3 Plasma membrane proteins ( Ste2 and Mup1 ) are not endocytosed without Arp2 / 3 . ( A ) Internalization of the Ste2 pheromone receptor was assayed after 40 - min incubation in the presence of (cid:3) - factor pheromone . This results in dominant vacuolar accumulation of Ste2 - GFP in WT cells with some signals visible as vesicles trafﬁcking en route to the vacuole . In arp2 cells , no strong vacuolar signal or moving vesicles were observed during time - lapse movies ( not shown ) . ( B ) Mup1 internalization was stimulated by the addition of methionine . Mup1 - GFP signal disappeared in WT cells at the plasma membrane , but it was still visible in arp2 cells ( right ) . When Mup1 was coupled to the pH - sensitive GFP variant , pHluorin , the Mup1 - pHluorin signal almost completely disappeared in WT cells upon addition of methionine , while Mup1 - pHluorin was still observed in arp2 cells that carried a CaRho1 overexpression , treated with sorbitol , and incubated overnight ( left ) .

Such dye accumulation at the plasma membrane likely indicates that cargo loading into vesicles isnotaffectedin arp2 / 3 mutants , whichisconsistentwithprevious time - lapse observations ( 31 ) . To rule out that cells were dead after CA treatment and to show that the effect of CA is reversible , we performed two control experiments . First , arp2 cells were assessed for viability after treatment with CA and found to be as viable as when treated with DMSO ( Fig . 5B , bottom ) . Second , CA - treated cellswerewashedandrecoveryofactindynamicswasassessedat4 , 8 , and 24 h , showing that at 4 and 8 h , only a few cells ( 2 % and 11 % , respectively ) showed actin dynamics and that at 24 h the majority of cells ( (cid:2) 90 % ) had regained actin dynamics . Together , these data demonstrate that arp2 mutants endocytose FM4 - 64 in an actin - dependent manner , suggesting that cargo uptake is an active process that depends on actin cable ﬁlaments and possibly other Arp2 / 3 - independent structures during AIE . Arp2 / 3 mutants show invaginating tubules . Arp2 / 3 nucle - ation has been suggested to provide the force to drive the invagi - nation and scission process during CME ( 15 , 18 ) . To test whether invaginating tubules still form in the absence of Arp2 / 3 in C . albi - cans , we examined invaginating structures using transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) . Invaginating tubules were on aver - age 121 and 117 nm long in WT and ARP2 revertant cells , respec - tively ( Fig . 6A ) , standing in good agreement with studies in S . cerevisiae ( 40 ) . Surprisingly , in arp2 / 3 mutants invaginating structures still formed but were on average longer than those in WT cells , ranging from 179 to 202 nm in arp2 and arp2 / arp3 mutants , respectively . In addition , invag - inating structures appeared uniformly tubular in control cells with maximum diameters of 100 nm , while in mutant cells , some invagination - like structures appeared close to the membrane , with di - ameters exceeding 100 nm ( Fig . 6B ) . To - gether , the data suggest that invaginating structures originating from the plasma membrane still form in the absence of Arp2 / 3 and might play a role during AIE ( see Discussion ) . DISCUSSION The discovery of clathrin - mediated en - docytosis ( CME ) more than 4 decades ago has provided the ﬁrst fundamental paradigm of how cells trafﬁc extracellular material and cell membrane components into the cell ( 3 , 23 ) . CME is a highly reg - ulated process and conserved from yeast to mammals ( 5 , 6 ) . Recently , several en - docytotic pathways that do not rely on clathrin have emerged , for instance , in Caenorhabditis elegans , Drosophila mela - nogaster , and in mammalian cells ( 23 , 24 , 41 ) . However , in fungi CME was long thought to be the sole route of endocyto - sis , a view that has only recently started to change ( 29 , 30 ) . Here , we examined Arp2 / 3 - inde - pendent endocytosis ( AIE ) in the human pathogen C . albicans and compared it to CME . We demonstrate that ( i ) the molecular mechanisms of CME in WT C . albicans cells are similar to those in other eukaryotic systems , supporting a high level of evolutionary conservation of CME ; ( ii ) that none of the 15 proteins tested , including clathrin , that participate in CME appear to contribute to AIE since they do not show proper functional characteristics , therefore highlighting how fundamentally differ - ently these pathways operate in this fungal species ; and ( iii ) that AIE is dependent on Arp2 / 3 - independent actin structures , most likely actin cables . Arp2 / 3 function during CME . The involvement of the Arp2 / 3 complex in CME has been well documented and includes , for example , organization of different components of the CME ma - chinery ( 42 – 45 ) . Much of this current knowledge has been ob - tained through mutational analysis coupled to live - cell micros - copy in either S . cerevisiae or Schizosaccharomyces pombe , two model organisms that are inviable in the absence of the Arp2 / 3 complex . In contrast , Arp2 / 3 is not essential for survival in C . al - bicans and arp2 / 3 mutants of this fungus are capable of lipid - and ﬂuid - phaseendocytosis , albeitatslightlyreducedrates ( 31 ) . Using this resource , our data show that every stage of the CME pathway tested becomes inactive without Arp2 / 3 ( Fig . 1 and 2 ; see Movie S1 in the supplemental material ) . Among the most dramatic effects of losing Arp2 / 3 is that some CME components ( Prk1 , Sjl2 , and Rvs161 ) were not localized to any clear structures ( see Movie S1 in the supplemental material ; data for Rvs161 not shown ) . This conﬁrms that the Arp2 / 3 com - FIG 4 Actin ﬁlament dynamics are not affected without Arp2 / 3 function . LIFEACT - GFP was used to visualize actin dynamics and showed that the rate of actin ﬁlament elongation was not affected in arp2 cells . Two populations of actin ﬁlaments observed in WT and arp2 cells are illustrated by arrowheads ( ﬁrst image in the time series ) and arrows ( subsequent images ) . See Movie S3 in the supplemental material . Epp et al . 6 ® mbio . asm . org September / October 2013 Volume 4 Issue 5 e00476 - 13 plex is necessary to correctly localize different components of the CME machinery to sites of endocytosis ( 43 – 45 ) , which in the case of Prk1 could directly depend on Arp2 and Arc40 , two physical interaction partners of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( 46 , 47 ) . Besides this known function , our data revealed another previously unappreci - ated role of Arp2 / 3 : disassembly of CME modules . Without Arp2 / 3 , Prk1 and Sjl2 are not correctly localized to sites of endo - cytosis , but they are necessary in WT cells for separate actin patch FIG 5 FM4 - 64 endocytosis is actin dependent in arp2 mutants . ( A , top ) Schematic representation of the experimental setup . Cells were treated with 10 (cid:1) g / ml cytochalasin A ( CA ) or DMSO for 3 min , at which time LIFEACT - GFP signals were assessed . Only arp2 cells completely lost LIFEACT - GFP signals ( left ) . In a second experiment , arp2 cells were treated with 10 (cid:1) g / ml CA for 3 min , FM4 - 64 was added at 20 (cid:1) g / ml for 5 min , unbound dye was washed away and cells were chased for another 20 min to allow dye internalization . During this 30 - min procedure , either DMSO or CA was present in the corresponding solutions . Endocytosis was blocked after 30 min by adding sodium azide and sodium ﬂuoride , and arp2 cells were assessed for endocytic capacity ( right , n (cid:2) 150 ) .

Arp2 / 3 - Independent Endocytosis in Candida albicans September / October 2013 Volume 4 Issue 5 e00476 - 13 ® mbio . asm . org 7 disassembly mechanisms during CME ( 44 , 48 – 51 ) . Therefore , Arp2 / 3 appears to contribute to actin patch disassembly by facil - itating recruitment of Prk1 and Sjl2 to sites of endocytosis . The lack of proper localization of various disassembly factors would also provide an explanation why components of the early , coat , and Myo / WASP module are trapped at the plasma membrane in arp2 mutants . Taken together , besides establishing the conserved nature of CME in WT cells in C . albicans , our data suggest that Arp2 / 3 contributes to different patch disassembly processes dur - ing CME . Given the abundant scientiﬁc evidence that links Arp2 / 3 to the invagination and scission processes during CME ( 15 , 18 ) , we were surprised to see invaginating structures in arp2 / 3 mutants ( Fig . 6 ) . Of note , invaginating structures have previously been observed in several S . cerevisiae mutants that lack components at critical stages of the CME machinery ( lipid - phase segregation or the vesicle scis - sion machinery ) ; both sjl1 sjl2 and vps1 mutants in S . cerevisiae showmembraneinvaginations ( 21 , 52 ) . OurTEMdataclearlylink Arp2 / 3 to membrane invaginations ; invaginations are longer and havewidernecksclosetothemembranein arp2 / 3 mutants . Future studies are required to delineate the precise function of the invagi - nations in arp2 / 3 mutants and whether such structures represent CME - independent routes of endocytosis . AIE in C . albicans . One surprising observation was that clath - rin light chain was divided into two distinct populations in arp2 / 3 mutants , as observed by time - lapse microscopy : one population lost its dynamic behavior and remained static at sites of endocy - tosis at the plasma membrane , while the second population re - tained some intracellular dynamics ( see Movies S1 and S2 in the supplemental material ) . The observation that plasma membrane - bound clathrin did not turn around , together with the fact that clathrin light chain did not appear to cycle between the membrane - bound and intracellular locations in arp2 cells , sug - gests that endocytosis in the absence of Arp2 / 3 is clathrin - independent . The mobile , intracellular clathrin population is likely involved in intracellular trafﬁcking at the trans - Golgi net - work ( TGN ) . It remains to be established , however , whether these intracellular clathrin signals are fully functional : for instance , whether budding of clathrin - coated vesicles ( CCV ) without Arp2 / 3 occurs , as a previous report in S . cerevisiae has shown that FIG 6 Invaginating tubules form independently of Arp2 / 3 . ( A ) Transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) showed that on average invaginating tubules are longer in arp2 / 3 mutants compared to control strains . Statistical signiﬁcance was assessed using Student’s t test .

( C ) Examples of invaginating tubules . Bar , 100 nm . Epp et al . 8 ® mbio . asm . org September / October 2013 Volume 4 Issue 5 e00476 - 13 Arp2 / 3 accumulates at TGN - derived CCVs ( 53 ) . The evidence presented here indicates that some aspects of the overall clathrin population in arp2 / 3 mutants do play essential roles and hence are Arp2 / 3 independent , as deletion of the clathrin heavy and light chains in C . albicans is lethal ( see Fig . S1 in the supplemental material ) . Why does membrane - bound clathrin require Arp2 / 3 to carry out receptor uptake ? It is possible that receptors are not internal - ized during AIE because clathrin is missing the Arp2 / 3 - driven force generation to endocytose such bulky cargo , while ﬂuid and lipids are less bulky and accordingly do not require the combina - tion of a structured clathrin cage , the Arp2 / 3 force , as well as other components of CME to endocytose . How cargo passes the plasma membrane during AIE without the apparent help of clathrin and how the dye ( FM4 - 64 ) is trafﬁcked to the vacuole are interesting questions that remain to be investigated . Time - lapse movies of FM4 - 64 uptake suggest that vesicles are not involved ( 31 ) , or if they are , they are too faint or small to be detected by current imaging techniques . Clathrin - independent endocytic pathways in fungal cells . In mammalian cells , different endocytotic pathways exist that do not require clathrin . Examples of such clathrin - independent path - ways include caveolae and caveolin endocytosis , macropinocyto - sis , ﬂotillin - dependent endocytosis , Arf6 - associated uptake as well as RhoA - dependent and Cdc42 - dependent uptake routes ( 26 ) . In fungal cells , the only described clathrin - independent pathway is mediated by Rho1 , a small GTPase from the Rho / Rac subfamily , in S . cerevisiae ( 30 ) . Both Rho1 - dependent endocytosis in S . cerevisiae and AIE in C . albicans appear to rely on clathrin - independent endocytic strategies , so one can wonder whether AIE uses similar mechanisms as the Rho1 - mediated pathway ( Fig . 7 ) . We started to address this question by testing PM protein endo - cytosis in arp2 mutants after overexpressing CaRho1 , the func - tional homolog of S . cerevisiae Rho1p ( 38 ) . When CaRho1 was overexpressed in C . albicans , PM protein ( Mup1 and Ste2 ) endo - cytosis did not occur , even after addition of osmotic support , a condition that has previously been shown to reduce the require - ment of actin during endocytosis ( 36 ) . Concluding that Rho1 - mediated endocytosis and AIE are two distinct pathways seems premature . It remains a possibility that CaRho1 does not have the same effector , Bni1 , in C . albicans , as in S . cerevisiae , where Bni1 is a direct effector of Rho1 . Support of this comes from the S . pombe FIG7 Modelofclathrin - mediatedendocytosis ( CME ) andclathrin - independentendocytosis ( CIE ) infungalcells . ( A ) CMEin Candidaalbicans , Saccharomyces cerevisiae , and Schizosaccharomycespombe workinasimilarlymodularway . First , theearlymodulearrivesatsitesofendocytosis , followedbyproteinsofthecoat , then the Myo / WASP , the actin , and ﬁnally the amphyphysin module . After vesicle scission , the cargo - loaded vesicle trafﬁcs via endosomes to the vacuole . ( B ) Currently , two CIE pathways in fungal cells have been described : Rho1 - dependent CIE in S . cerevisiae and Arp2 / 3 - independent CIE in C . albicans . Both routes seem not to rely on protein modules of the CME pathway , and yet cargo such as the membrane - impermeable dye FM4 - 64 still accumulate in the vacuole over time . Rho1 - CIE relies on Rho1 and Bni1 , while both Rho1 - dependent and Arp2 / 3 - independent CIE rely on Arp2 / 3 - independent actin structures . If and how cargo is loaded into vesicles and how cargo crosses the membrane and trafﬁcs to the vacuole are unknown both in Rho1 - CIE and Arp2 / 3 - independent CIE . Whether Rho1 - CIE and Arp2 / 3 - independent endocytosis are one or two distinct ways for CIE remains to be shown . See text for details . Arp2 / 3 - Independent Endocytosis in Candida albicans September / October 2013 Volume 4 Issue 5 e00476 - 13 ® mbio . asm . org 9 homolog of Bni1 in yeast , For3 , which is an effector for Cdc42 and Rho3 but not Rho1 ( 54 ) . Independent of whether Rho1 and AIE share the same or dis - tinct pathways , our data support the idea that actin cables are involved in AIE ; the chemical disruption of actin cables did not allow any endocytosis in arp2 / 3 mutants ( Fig . 5 ) . We therefore suggest that Arp2 / 3 - unrelated actin functions could compensate for endocytotic uptake in arp2 / 3 mutants , an idea that is sup - ported by microarray experiments that showed that in arp2 / 3 mu - tants , several actin - related genes were overexpressed ( 31 ) . Similar to mammalian systems , several CIE pathways might exist in fungal species . Clearly , the details of CIE in fungal organ - isms warrant further investigation , particularly whether CIE path - ways play similar roles in fungi as they do in mammalian cells , where CIE routes can contribute the majority of membrane and ﬂuid fraction taken up into the cell ( up to 70 % ) and are involved in repairing plasma membrane , cellular polarization , as well as modulation of intercellular signaling ( 26 – 28 ) . Taking advantage of C . albicans to functionally differentiate AIE from other endo - cytic pathways , this pathogenic fungus provides an ideal starting point to expand our knowledge of how endocytosis works , partic - ularly in the context of how damaged plasma membrane or cell wall components are recycled while being exposed to clinically relevant plasma membrane / cell wall - targeting drugs . Advances in our understanding of endocytosis might one day help to combat fungal drug resistance and ultimately lead to improved therapy options for patients . MATERIALS AND METHODS Strains and media . All strains are derived from SN148 ( 55 ) and are listed in Table S1 in the supplemental material together with primers used in thisstudy , whicharelistedinTableS2inthesupplementalmaterial . Strain construction followed standard transformation protocols , using homol - ogous recombination for genomic marker integration , and selection on synthetic media ( see below ) that contained the necessary auxotrophic supplements , as described previously ( 56 ) . Correct marker insertion was veriﬁed by diagnostic PCR ( 57 ) . In order to have sufﬁcient auxotrophic markers available for subsequent experiments , we ﬁrst constructed strain CaEE341 , which served as the arp2 deletion background throughout this study . CaEE341 was created by deleting the ﬁrst ARP2 allele as described ( 31 ) , using LEU2 from Candida maltose as a marker ( 58 ) . The second ARP2 allele was deleted with the nourseothricin - based approach , using pSFS2A as described previously ( 56 ) . Brieﬂy , 485 bp of upstream homol - ogous sequence to ARP2 was ampliﬁed with primers oEE166 and oEE382 and cloned in pEE33 ( 31 ) , between the KpnI / XhoI sites . This resulted in plasmid pEE59 , which was digested with KpnI and SacII prior to transfor - mation . To tag proteins with GFP , 120 - mer oligonucleotides were used to am - plify CaGFP (cid:4) ( 59 ) cassettes and inserted at the 3 = end of the open reading frame ( ORF ) , thusnotinterferingwiththeendogenouspromoters . Forall GFP - tagged strains that we used for quantitative motion analysis , the second allele was disrupted , thus leaving only the GFP - tagged version in the genome . These GFP - tagged strains did not show any signiﬁcant de - fects in terms of growth rate or morphology , and all GFP - tagged strains created in the WT background formed hyphae , indicating that the GFP constructs did not signiﬁcantly interfere with functionality ( see Table S1 in the supplemental material ) . Inordertofuse STE2 toGFP , weusedplasmidpADH - STE2 - GFP ( 60 ) . STE2 pheromone receptor internalization was carried out by adding 30 (cid:1) g / ml of a synthetic 13 - amino - acid version of the (cid:3) - factor mating pheromone dissolved in 50 % methanol ( 1 mg / ml ) . Cells were imaged after 40 min of pheromone addition . Strains were routinely grown in standard YPD medium ( 1 % yeast extract , 2 % peptone , 2 % dextrose , supplementedwith50mg / mluridine ) , synthetic complete ( SC ) medium ( 2 % dextrose , 6 . 7 % yeast nitrogen base without amino acids , 1 . 5 % of a complete amino acid mix , supplemented with 50 mg / ml of each uridine , histidine , leucine , and arginine ) , or SC - (cid:3) met medium , which is identical to SC medium , except that SC (cid:3) met medium lacked methionine and was adjusted to pH 5 . 5 . Mup1 internal - ization was induced by adding 20 (cid:1) g / ml of methionine to cells grown overnightinSC (cid:3) metmedium . Because arp2 cellsgrewpoorlyinSC (cid:3) met medium , we incubated arp2 mutants carrying Mup1 - GFP or Mup1 - pHluorin in YPD overnight and then diluted cells into fresh SC or SC - (cid:3) met medium before imaging . Sorbitol was added for 45 min in strain CaEE720 . For experiments involving cytochalasin A ( CA ) , the drug was dissolved to 1 mg / ml in DMSO and stored at (cid:3) 20°C . Cells were grown in SC medium for all experiments involving CA . The FM4 - 64 uptake was done as previously described in SC medium ( 31 ) , except that endocytosis was blocked by the addition of sodium azide and sodium ﬂuoride ( ﬁnal concentration , 10 mM ) . Plasmids . The LIFEACT - GFP plasmid ( pEE113 ) was constructed by amplifying the CaGFP (cid:4) sequence ( 59 ) with primers oEE653 and oEE663 and cloned between PstI and SpeI sites in pFA - GFP - URA3 ( 58 ) . Primer oEE653containstheﬁrst51aminoacidsfrom S . cerevisiae ABP140 , which is sufﬁcient for actin binding ( 39 ) . Primers oEE653 and oEE663 also con - tain 100 bp of homology to up - and downstream regions of ACT1 , which are used to insert pEE113 at the actin locus . Prior to transformation , pEE113 was digested with PstI and SpeI . Expression of LIFEACT - GFP did not appear to affect C . albicans physiology as hyphal formation was not inﬂuenced in WT cells and the sensitivity to cytochalasin A ( CA ) , a drug that binds barbed ends of actin ﬁlaments ( 61 , 62 ) , was the same as that in the control cells ( data not shown ) . The pH - sensitive GFP variant pHluorin was created based on the su - perecliptic pHluorin sequence ( 63 ) . In order to do this , the QuikChange multisite - directed mutagenesis kit ( Agilent Technologies ) was used to exchange the following sites in CaGFP (cid:4) ( 59 ) : S147D , N149Q , S202F , Q204T , A206T , Q80R , T167I , S175G , using primers oEE622 and oEE623 and oEE680 , oEE681 , and oEE682 . This resulted in plasmid pCaEE114 . Overexpression of RHO1 was achieved using the actin promoter from pACT1 ( 64 ) fused to the Rho1 coding sequence , resulting in plasmid pACT1 - RHO1 , where the Rho1 sequence was ampliﬁed with primers oEE705 and oEE723 and inserted between the HindIII and XmaI sites . pACT1 - RHO1 was digested with StuI and inserted at the RPS1 locus . Rho1 overexpression was conﬁrmed by real - time quantitative PCR as described previously ( 65 ) , using as a reference the coding sequence for constitutively expressed C . albicans snoRNAs ( primers pAsCaSnoR46F1 and pAsCaSnoR46R1 ) ( 64 ) . All plasmids created in this study were veri - ﬁed by sequencing . Fluorescence microscopy . Cells were grown to the log phase in SC or SC (cid:3) met medium , gently concentrated , and applied to precleaned slides , which were covered with coverslips . Slide cleaning was done as described previously ( 66 ) . Only yeast - phase cells were used for microscopy . Cells were grown at 30°C for wide - ﬁeld microscopy and at room temperature for confocal microscopy . For wide - ﬁeld microscopy , an inverted Leica DMIRE2 microscope with a 100 (cid:4) immersion oil objective and a 10 (cid:4) projection lens was used . Images were acquired using OpenLab ( version 5 . 5 . 0 ) . For confocal microscopy , image data were collected using a cus - tomized WaveFX spinning - disk confocal microscope ( Quorum Technol - ogies ) built on a Leica DM6000 inverted body , with a 100 - by - 1 . 46 NA Plan - Apochromat objective , piezo stage ( ASI ) , and DAQ control board , laser merge module ( Spectral ) , 493 - and 561 - nm solid - state lasers ( Co - herent ) , and a water - cooled bt - EMCCD camera with photon counting enabled ( Hamamatsu ) . Metamorph ( version 7 . 7 . 3 . 0 . ) was used for image acquisition . Data were collected in two ways—either ( i ) in one medial focal plane with a 50 - to 200 - ms exposure time at intervals of 50 ms to 1 s for a duration of 2 to 6 min or ( ii ) as stacks ( 200 - nm z steps in 20 focal planes ) with a capture time of ~ 2 . 5 s / stack for 2 to 6 min . Metamorph’s Epp et al . 10 ® mbio . asm . org September / October 2013 Volume 4 Issue 5 e00476 - 13 streamfunctionfortimeandstackwasusedwhenacquiringdataasstacks , which resulted in negligibly small intervals between stacks . TIRF microscopy was done using a Zeiss Axiovert Z1 microscope chassis , 100 - by - 1 . 45 NA Plan - Apochromat objective lens , and the Zeiss TIRF III slider . Diode - pumped solid - state lasers ( Cobolt Jive , Cobolt Ca - lypso ) were coupled to ﬁber optic cables in free space and introduced into the Zeiss slider . Images were recorded using an Andor iXon (cid:5) DV - 897 EMCCD camera and MetaMorph software . Image analysis . Quantitative motion analysis of patch dynamics was done using Imaris (cid:4) 64 ( version 7 . 2 . 3 ) developed by Bitplane AG . Be - tween 20 and 120 spots were quantitatively analyzed for every component of the clathrin - mediated pathway . Brieﬂy , the spot detection algorithm in Imaris was used to measure spot dynamics over time by setting the esti - mated diameter to 0 . 35 (cid:1) m with the background subtraction selected . The quality attribute in the ﬁlter type setting was manually used to set the signal threshold in order to distinguish background from patch signals . The autoregressive motion algorithm was used with parameters set be - tween 0 . 5 and 0 . 1 (cid:1) m for maximum distance ( “Max Distance” ) , and the “MaxGapSize”optionwassetbetween1and3 . Alltrackscreatedthisway were visually inspected and had to satisfy the following criteria : ( i ) the patch was initially present at the cell cortex , ( ii ) the patch was clearly distinguishable from other patches ( i . e . , did not merge with another patch ) , and ( iii ) the entire lifetime from patch appearance to disappear - ancewasrecorded . Thelastcriteriondidnotapplyto arp2 cells , aspatches often did not disappear . Statistics in the form of mean square displace - ment ( MSD ) , track duration , and track displacement length were ex - ported into Excel , which was used to create graphs . MSD plots for WT cells were truncated when 50 % of the patches had disappeared , thus rep - resenting the median lifetime , or in the case of arp2 cells , MSD plots represent the ﬁrst 70 s of analysis . “Cells leaving origin” was deﬁned as signals that either moved more than 100 nm from where they were ﬁrst detected ( applied for the actin module ) or signals that disappeared ( ap - plied for the early , coat , Myo / WASP , and scission modules ) . Electron microscopy . Samples used for transmission electron micro - copy ( TEM ) were processed according to standard techniques as de - scribed previously ( 60 ) . Brieﬂy , samples were ﬁxed with 3 % EM - grade glutaraldehyde in 1 (cid:4) sodium cacodylate buffer ( pH 7 . 4 ) at room temper - ature . Afterﬁxation , sampleswerewashedinbufferandresuspendedinan aqueous 4 % permanganate solution , washed , stained with uranyl acetate , dehydrated through a graded series of ethyl alcohol , and embedded in Epon resin . Ultrathin sections of 80 nm were cut with a Reichert - Jung ( Heidelberg , Germany ) UltracutE ultramicrotome , placed on Formvar - coated slot copper grids , and viewed with a FEI Tecnai12 BioTwinG2 electron microscope ( Eindhoven , The Netherlands ) . Digital images were acquiredwithanAMTXR - 60CCDdigitalcamerasystem . TheTEManal - yses were carried out at Stony Brook University at the Microscopy Imag - ing Center .
