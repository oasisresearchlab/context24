Power spectrum analysis for optical tweezers Kirstine Berg - Sørensen a ) The Niels Bohr Institute , Blegdamsvej 17 , DK - 2100 Copenhagen Ø , Denmark Henrik Flyvbjerg b ) Plant Research Department , Risø National Laboratory , DK - 4000 Roskilde , Denmark ~ Received 7 April 2003 ; accepted 1 December 2003 ! The force exerted by an optical trap on a dielectric bead in a ﬂuid is often found by ﬁtting a Lorentzian to the power spectrum of Brownian motion of the bead in the trap . We present explicit functions of the experimental power spectrum that give the values of the parameters ﬁtted , including error bars and correlations , for the best such x 2 ﬁt in a given frequency range . We use these functions to determine the information content of various parts of the power spectrum , and ﬁnd , at odds with lore , much information at relatively high frequencies . Applying the method to real data , we obtain perfect ﬁts and calibrate tweezers with less than 1 % error when the trapping force is not too strong . Relatively strong traps have power spectra that cannot be ﬁtted properly with any Lorentzian , we ﬁnd . This underscores the need for better understanding of the power spectrum than the Lorentzian provides . This is achieved using old and new theory for Brownian motion in an incompressible ﬂuid , and new results for a popular photodetection system . The trap and photodetection system are then calibrated simultaneously in a manner that makes optical tweezers a tool of precision for force spectroscopy , local viscometry , and probably other applications . © 2004 American Institute of Physics . @ DOI : 10 . 1063 / 1 . 1645654 # I . INTRODUCTION Optical tweezers are used in many contexts in biological physics , 1 e . g . , in single molecule studies of molecular motors 2 , 3 and other proteins and polymers , 4 – 7 and in surgery at the cellular level , 8 to name a few . In some of these con - texts , the tweezers are only used to grab and hold something . In other contexts , they are used to exert a prescribed force , or to measure force : pico - Newton forces are measured or exerted , 4 , 7 , 9 – 11 local viscosity is measured , 12 – 14 or properties of a system are deduced from the Brownian motion of its parts . 15 – 17 While relative relationships for , e . g . , force versus displacement can be calculated theoretically in a decent approximation , 18 the absolute value of the force cannot . It depends too much on experimental circumstances . So cali - bration is necessary . Good calibration is also a test that the tweezers , detection system , and data acquisition work as they are supposed to . As tweezer technology evolves and applica - tions multiply , the need for good calibration methods will undoubtedly grow . There are a number of ways to calibrate optical traps . ~ We use trap and tweezers as synonyms . ! They are discussed in several excellent texts . 19 – 25 The most reliable procedure interprets the power spectrum of Brownian motion of a bead in the trap . This is conventionally done with the Einstein – Ornstein – Uhlenbeck theory of Brownian motion , which pre - dicts a Lorentzian spectrum . The stochastic distribution of experimental spectral values about this Lorentzian is also known theoretically ~ Sec . III ! . This fact , and the simplicity of the Lorentzian form , permit us to give explicit analytical results for the values of ﬁtted parameters as functions of the experimental power spectrum ~ Sec . IV ! . Thus , when the power spectrum is legitimately modeled with a Lorentzian , these results ﬁt it with ease , insight , and error bars on the parameter values found . The trap’s strength is consequently known with precision that may be limited mainly by the calibration of the position detection system ~ Sec . V ! . Very similar results might be obtained also when alias - ing is taken into account ~ Sec . VI ! , but are not that interest - ing because the Lorentzian is a low - frequency approximation ~ Sec . VII ! that can exploit only a fraction of the information content of the power spectrum ~ Sec . VIII ! . Even worse is the fact that even at intermediate trapping strengths some photo - detection systems have no low - frequency window at all in which a Lorentzian can be ﬁtted properly . Thus a correct theory for the power spectrum is needed when the Lorentzian fails , and in general improves precision . We show that the power spectrum can be fully understood by combining known and new results on Brownian motion in incompressible ﬂuids ~ Secs . IX – XII ! with new results for typical photodetection systems ~ Sec . XIII ! . Once the effects of aliasing and antialiasing ﬁlters are accounted for ~ Sec . XIV ! , we have a procedure for how to calibrate tweezers ~ Secs . XV and XVI ! which , e . g . , adds decades of interpret - able spectrum to local viscometry measurements . It makes details of the power spectrum of complex systems interpretable . 17 And it may open up the way for new appli - cations of tweezers by making them a tool of precision . Thus the thrust of this article is theory for how to ana - lyze experimental data , with examples of how this is done .

MATERIALS AND METHODS The experimental data analyzed here were obtained with the optical tweezer setup described in Ref . 27 . The laser light had wavelength l 5 1064 nm and positions were detected with a silicon PIN photodiode , S5981 from Hamamatsu , which is a popular choice because of its large active area , 10 3 10 mm . The trapped microsphere was from a batch of uniform microspheres from Bang Laboratories , Inc . , catalog code No . PS04N , Bangs lot No . 1013 , Inventory No . L920902A , with density of 1 . 050 g / ml and diameter of 1 . 05 6 0 . 01 m m . 28 The equipment was tested for electronic and mechanical noise in two ‘‘null tests’’ described in Appendix B . These tests set a bound on electronic noise , on the laser beam’s pointing instability , and on much , but not all , mechanical noise . Crosstalk between x - and y - channel data was diag - nosed and removed by a linear transformation described in Appendix C . A model - independent data analysis that tests our assumption of a harmonic trapping potential was done and is described in Appendix D . This test can indicate , but not prove , that the potential actually is harmonic , so its role is to warn us against analyzing data that seem to not satisfy this essential assumption . The data analyzed here pass this and another test @ Fig . 1 ~ b ! # to perfection . III . SIMPLE THEORY RECAPITULATED The Einstein – Ornstein – Uhlenbeck theory of Brownian motion 29 describes the motion of the bead in a harmonic trapping potential with the following Langevin equation : mx¨ ~ t ! 1 g 0 x˙ ~ t ! 1 k x ~ t ! 5 ~ 2 k B T g 0 ! 1 / 2 h ~ t ! , ~ 1 ! given here in one dimension for simplicity . Here x ( t ) is the trajectory of the Brownian particle , m is its mass , g 0 its friction coefﬁcient , 2 k x ( t ) the harmonic force from the trap , and ( 2 k B T g 0 ) 1 / 2 h ( t ) a random Gaussian process that represents Brownian forces at absolute temperature T ; for all t and t 8 : ^ h ~ t ! & 5 0 ; ^ h ~ t ! h ~ t 8 ! & 5 d ~ t 2 t 8 ! . ~ 2 ! Stokes’s law for a spherical particle gives g 0 5 6 prn R , ~ 3 ! where rn is the ﬂuid’s shear viscosity , r the ﬂuid’s density , n its kinematic viscosity , and R the sphere’s radius . The characteristic time for loss of kinetic energy through friction , t inert [ m / g 0 , is 1000 times shorter than our experi - mental time resolution at 16 kHz sampling rate . We conse - quently follow Einstein and drop the inertial term in Eq . ~ 1 ! , so it then reads x˙ ~ t ! 1 2 p f c x ~ t ! 5 ~ 2 D ! 1 / 2 h ~ t ! , ~ 4 ! where the corner frequency , f c [ k / ~ 2 pg 0 ! , ~ 5 ! has been introduced , and Einstein’s equation , D 5 k B T / g 0 ~ 6 ! relating the diffusion constant , Boltzmann energy , and fric - tion coefﬁcient has been used . After recording x ( t ) for time T msr , we Fourier transform x ( t ) and h ( t ) , x˜ k 5 E 2 T msr / 2 T msr / 2 d te i 2 p f k t x ~ t ! , f k [ k / T msr , k integer . ~ 7 ! Equation ~ 4 ! gives the path as a function of noise , x˜ k 5 ~ 2 D ! 1 / 2 h ˜ k 2 p ~ f c 2 if k ! . ~ When x˙ ( t ) is Fourier transformed , partial integration gives a contribution from the ends of the interval of integration which we ignore . This leakage term ~ Ref . 30 , Sec . 12 . 7 ! is truly negligible in our case because the power spectral den - sity in Eq . ~ 10 ! is a smooth function without spikes or other abrupt changes in value . ! From Eq . ~ 2 ! it follows that ^ h ˜ k & 5 0 ; ^ h ˜ k * h ˜ , & 5 T msr d k , , ; ^ u h ˜ k u 4 & 5 2 T msr2 . ~ 8 ! Since h ( t ) is an uncorrelated Gaussian process , ( Re h ˜ k ) k 5 0 , 1 , . . . and ( Im h ˜ k ) k 5 1 , 2 , . . . are uncorrelated random variables with Gaussian distribution . Consequently , ( u h ˜ k u 2 ) k 5 1 , 2 , . . . are uncorrelated non - negative random vari - ables with exponential distribution . Hence so are experimen - tal values for the power spectrum , P k ~ ex ! [ u x˜ k u 2 / T msr 5 D / ~ 2 p 2 T msr ! u h ˜ k u 2 f c 2 1 f k 2 ~ 9 ! for k . 0 . Their expected value is a Lorentzian , P k [ ^ P k ~ ex ! & 5 D / ~ 2 p 2 ! f c 2 1 f k 2 , ~ 10 ! and because P k ( ex ) is exponentially distributed , s @ P k ~ ex ! # 5 ^ ~ P k ~ ex ! 2 P k ! 2 & 1 / 2 5 P k . ~ 11 !

From the resulting time series x j [ x ( t j ) , j 5 1 , . . . , N , we form the discrete Fourier transform , xˆ k [ D t ( j 5 1 N e i 2 p f k t j x j 5 D t ( j 5 1 N e i 2 p jk / N x j , ~ 12 ! k 52 N / 2 1 1 , . . . , N / 2 , where D t [ 1 / f sample , t j 5 j D t , and N D t 5 T msr . This discrete Fourier transform is a good ap - proximation to the continuous one , Eq . ~ 7 ! , for frequencies u f k u ! f sample . Consequently , the experimental power spec - trum 595 Rev . Sci .

VI for de - tails . Least - squares ﬁtting in its simplest form presupposes that each data point is ‘‘drawn’’ from a Gaussian distribution and that different data points are statistically independent . The second condition is satisﬁed by P k in Eq . ~ 9 ! , but the ﬁrst is not , since P k is exponentially distributed . The solution is data compression , which results in a smaller data set with less noise , and , by way of the central limit theorem , in nor - mally distributed data . Data compression by windowing is common and has its advantages . 30 When the number n w of windows used is large , the values of the compressed power spectrum are statistically independent and Gaussian distributed , and can be used in the formulas below . Windowing always compresses to equidis - tant points on the frequency axis . ‘‘Blocking’’ is an alterna - tive method without this constraint , and hence is useful for data display with the logarithmic frequency axis . It replaces a ‘‘block’’ of n b consecutive data points ( f , P ( ex ) ( f ) ) with a single new ‘‘data point’’ ( f¯ , P¯ ( ex ) ( f ) ) , with coordinates that simply are block averages . 30 When n b is so large that we can ignore terms of nonleading power in n b , P¯ ( ex ) ( f¯ ) is Gauss - ian distributed with ^ P¯ ( ex ) ( f¯ ) & 5 P ( f¯ ) and s ( P¯ ( ex ) ( f¯ ) ) 5 P ( f¯ ) / A n b . In the following , it is understood that data have been blocked ~ or windowed , or both ! , but we leave out the overbar to keep the notation simple . We ﬁt by minimizing x 2 5 ( k S P k ~ ex ! 2 P k P k / A n b D 2 5 n b n w ( k S P k ~ ex ! P k 2 1 D 2 ; see Appendix E for background . This x 2 can be minimized analytically : The theoretical spectrum can be written P k 5 ( a 1 bf k 2 ) 2 1 with a and b positive parameters to be ﬁtted , so x 2 is a quadratic function of a and b . Minimization gives f c 5 ~ a / b ! 1 / 2 5 S S 0 , 1 S 2 , 2 2 S 1 , 1 S 1 , 2 S 1 , 1 S 0 , 2 2 S 0 , 1 S 1 , 2 D 1 / 2 , ~ 13 !

V . FROM MILLIVOLTS TO NANOMETERS : CALIBRATING LENGTH SCALES Note that we ﬁt both D and f c to the power spectrum of the x coordinate , and , in an independent ﬁt , to the power spectrum of the y coordinate . The position detection system’s output has a somewhat arbitrary amplitude that depends lin - early on laser power and the three independent ampliﬁer set - tings for the voltages measured , V I 2 V II 2 V III 1 V IV , V I 1 V II 2 V III 2 V IV , and V z deﬁned in Appendix C . This results in three arbitrary measures of length , one for each direction , x , y , and z . We determine two of the three corresponding conversion factors to units of physical length by equating the ﬁtted values for D , which is determined in arbitrary units , to the value in physical units known from Einstein’s relation , Eq . ~ 6 ! . The ﬁtted values of D can be determined with high pre - cision , as demonstrated below . Its value in physical units , however , is not known with similar precision in some bio - physical experiments . While the temperature T can be known very well , the value of g 0 is a source of error in Einstein’s relation . Microspheres are commercially available with ra - dius R known to within 1 % and similar precision of the spherical shape , so Stokes law , Eq . ~ 3 ! , applies . But the value of the dynamic viscosity rn of the ﬂuid , in which the experi - ments take place , may not be known with the same precision . Additives such as glucose , BSA , and casein change the value of rn dramatically . Five percent of glucose , e . g . , changes the viscosity of water by a factor of 1 . 12 . 32 Similarly , 5 % of NaCl changes the viscosity of water by a factor of 1 . 19 . Such concentrations of additives occur , e . g . , in studies of single kinesin molecules 33 and in studies of single myosin molecules . 34 In such cases it is better to determine the con - version factors from arbitrary units to physical units of length by independent measurements , as was done in , e . g . , Refs . 23 and 35 . The ﬁtted values of D may then serve as either a check of consistency for the method , or as indepen - dent determination of the value of g 0 , hence of rn , which may also be calculated if one knows the concentrations of additives and how they affect the viscosity . VI . ALIASED LORENTZIAN We will now understand the effect of ﬁnite sampling time better than we did in Sec . IV : In an experiment we sample x ( t ) at discrete times t j 5 j D t , D t [ 1 / f sample . We consequently solve Eq . ~ 4 ! in the time interval t j < t < t j 1 1 for given noise to ﬁnd the effective Einstein – Ornstein – Uhlenbeck theory for discretely sampled data . We ﬁnd x j 1 1 5 cx j 1 D x h j , ~ 15 ! with ^ h j & 5 0 ; ^ h i h j & 5 d i , j for all i , j . ~ 16 ! Here we have introduced h j [ S 4 p f c 1 2 c 2 D 1 / 2 E t j t j 1 1 dte 2 2 p f c ~ t j 1 1 2 t ! h ~ t ! , ~ 17 ! c [ exp ~ 2 p f c / f Nyq ! ; f Nyq [ f sample / 2 , ~ 18 ! and D x [ S ~ 1 2 c 2 !

So now our experimental es - timate for the power spectrum is P k ~ ex ! 5 u xˆ k u 2 / T 5 ~ D x ! 2 u h ˆ k u 2 / T 1 1 c 2 2 2 c cos ~ 2 p k / N ! . ~ 22 ! The expected value for this spectrum is P k [ ^ P k ~ ex ! & 5 ^ u xˆ k u 2 / T & 5 ~ D x ! 2 D t 1 1 c 2 2 2 c cos ~ 2 p k / N ! , ~ 23 ! and its root - mean - square deviation is s ~ P k ~ ex ! ! 5 P k , ~ 24 ! identical in form to Eq . ~ 11 ! because u h ˆ k u 2 like u h ˜ k u 2 is ex - ponentially distributed . Equation ~ 23 ! gives the function that replaces the Lorentzian in the case of ﬁnite sampling frequency , and it should ﬁt the experimental spectrum for all frequencies of 0 , f k < f Nyq if the simple theory discussed here is correct . Least - squares ﬁtting of Eq . ~ 23 ! to experimental data can be done analytically , once and for all , and it results in expres - sions very similar to those in Sec . IV . We note that for f c ! f Nyq and u f k u ! f Nyq , Eq . ~ 23 ! to leading order in f c / f Nyq and f k / f Nyq becomes the Lorentzian in Eq . ~ 10 ! . So the approximation done in Sec . IV when we ﬁtted the Lorentzian to the experimental spectrum has now been understood within the same simple theory for Brownian motion by accounting for the ﬁnite sampling frequency . The effect of the latter is maximal at f Nyq 5 f N / 2 where , for same f c and D , P N / 2 5 2 . 47 P ( f N / 2 ) , i . e . , at f Nyq the ﬁnite sampling rate increases the power spectrum by 247 % over its Lorent - zian value . With this understanding , it seems more correct to replace the Lorentzian altogether with Eq . ~ 23 ! , the so - called aliased Lorentzian ; see Appendix H for more about aliasing . More so because so - called antialiasing ﬁlters do not change the aliased Lorentzian back into a Lorentzian ; see Fig . 11 . The outcome of this replacement can be determined without ac - tually doing it from a simple phenomenological plot of the experimental power spectrum . If an aliased Lorentzian ﬁts the experimental power spectrum P k ( ex ) , a plot of P k ( ex ) 2 1 vs cos ( 2 p k / N ) falls onto a straight line , according to Eq . ~ 23 ! . Figure 1 shows our experimental power spectrum plotted in this manner . Clearly , the data points do not fall onto a straight line . They do increasingly for smaller beads and sampling rates , especially for a different photodetection sys - tem and / or shorter laser wavelength , as explained below . VII . LIMITS ON LORENTZIANS Over which range of frequencies f k should the sums S p , q be done ? Stochastic errors are minimized by maximizing this range , but systematic errors limit the range : At low frequen - cies the experimental power spectrum typically is contami - nated by low - frequency noise external to the experiment ; see Appendix B . At high frequencies there are three concerns : ~ i ! The Lorentzian is a good approximation only for f 2 ! f Nyq 2 , where f Nyq [ f sample / 2 , as we have seen . As we have also seen , one can trade this approximation for an exact result , an aliased Lorentzian , but the latter does not describe the data . Other effects are in play . ~ ii ! Some position detection sys - tems , including ours , unintentionally cause signiﬁcant low - pass ﬁltering . 36 ~ iii ! The Einstein – Ornstein – Uhlenbeck theory of Brownian motion is only a low - frequency approxi - mation when used for liquids ; the hydrodynamically correct spectrum is not Lorentzian . Thus one should ﬁt with a Lorentzian in an interval @ f min , f max # that avoids these systematic errors at high and low frequencies while minimizing stochastic errors of the ﬁtted parameters . To this end , we give the stochastic errors’ dependence on @ f min , f max # . VIII . INFORMATION CONTENT OF THE SPECTRUM Given Eqs . ~ 13 ! and ~ 14 ! , propagation of errors gives ~ see Appendix F ! s ~ f c ! f c 5 s f c ~ x min , x max ! A p f c T msr , ~ 25 ! s ~ D !

Inverse experimental power spectrum , P k ( ex ) 2 1 plotted vs cos ( p f / f Nyq ) . Plotted this way , an aliased Lorentzian form would fall onto a straight line , see Eq . ~ 23 ! . In case one uses an oversampling delta – sigma data converter , aliasing and electronic ﬁltering do not occur below the out - put frequency . So for that case one should plot P k ( ex ) 2 1 vs f 2 . Then a pure Lorentzian form falls onto a straight line , and effects of frequency - dependent hydrodynamical friction and unintended ﬁltering ~ see Secs . IX – XIII ! show up as curvature . 597 Rev .

The function s f c is normalized such that s f c ( 0 , ‘ ) 5 1 . Thus s f c ( x min , x max ) > 1 , because maximum precision is achieved only by ﬁtting to the whole spectrum . Less will do in prac - tice , and do well , as Figs . 2 and 3 illustrate . Figure 2 has f c 5 357 Hz , f min 5 110 Hz , and f max 5 1 kHz , hence s f c ( x min , x max ) 5 s f c ( 0 . 31 , 2 . 80 ) 5 2 . 4 . For com - parison , s f c ( 0 , 2 . 80 ) 5 1 . 8 . So , given our value for f max , our nonvanishing value for f min costs us a 30 % increase in the error bar for the value we ﬁnd for f c . On the other hand , s f c ( 0 . 31 , ‘ ) 5 1 . 26 . So , given our value for f min , by increas - ing f max we could reduce the stochastic error for f c by almost a factor of 2 , if systematic errors did not prevent this . This is despite f max . 3 f c . To harvest this extra information , one needs a better understanding of the power spectrum at these frequencies than the Lorentzian provides . Systematic errors may leave no frequency range at all in which one can properly ﬁt a Lorentzian . A data set with almost twice larger corner frequency illustrates this , although it is sampled three times faster . When a Lorentzian is ﬁtted to this power spectrum , f c decreases as f max is increased , and support for the ﬁt vanishes although f max2 ! f Nyq2 is satisﬁed ; see Table I . In this case , proper calibration is impossible without better understanding of the power spectrum than the Lorentzian provides . Below , this understanding is provided , and calibration is achieved using the very same data set . IX . FRICTION FELT BY A MICROSPHERE MOVING IN AN INCOMPRESSIBLE FLUID When a rigid body moves through a dense ﬂuid like water , the friction between the body and ﬂuid depends on the body’s past motion , since that determines the ﬂuid’s present motion . For a sphere performing linear harmonic motion x ( t ) with cyclic frequency v 5 2 p f in an incompressible ﬂuid and at vanishing Reynold’s number , the ~ Navier – ! Stokes equations were solved analytically and give a ‘‘fric - tional’’ force , 37 , 38 F fric 52 g 0 S 1 1 R d D x˙ 2 S 3 pr R 2 d 1 2 3 pr R 3 D x¨ , ~ 29 ! where only the term containing x˙ dissipates energy ; the term containing x¨ is inertial force from entrained ﬂuid . The nota - tion is the same as above : g 0 is the friction coefﬁcient of Stokes’ law for linear motion with constant velocity , Eq . ~ 3 ! , r 5 1 . 0 g / cm is the density of water at room temperature , n 5 1 . 0 m m 2 / s is the kinematic friction coefﬁcient of water , and 2 R 5 1 . 05 m m is the diameter of the sphere we used . Thus g 0 5 9 3 10 2 6 g / s . The penetration depth d character - izes the exponential decrease of the ﬂuid’s velocity ﬁeld as a function of the distance from the oscillating sphere . It is frequency dependent , d ~ f ! 5 ~ n / p f ! 1 / 2 5 R ~ f n / f ! 1 / 2 , ~ 30 ! and large compared to R for the frequencies we consider , f n [ n / ( p R 2 ) 5 1 . 3 MHz . This and other notations are given in Appendix A . X .

This pattern is unrelated to the mass of the sphere . It need not have any , for that matter . f m parameterizes the time it takes for friction to dissipate the kinetic energy of the sphere and the ﬂuid it entrains . It depends on the mass of the sphere . By keeping both parameters in formulas , the physical origin of various terms remains clear . ! .

The radius R of the bead now also occurs in f n and f m , and not only through f c , but it is not a parameter we must ﬁt , because it is known to 1 % uncertainty , and occurs only in terms that are so small that this small uncertainty of R has negligible effect on P hydro ( f ) . XI . FAXE´N’S FORMULA GENERALIZED TO LINEAR HARMONIC MOTION The frictional force in Eq . ~ 29 ! was derived by Stokes under the assumption that the oscillating sphere is inﬁnitely deep inside the ﬂuid volume . For optimal designs , the lens that focuses the light into an optical trap typically has a short focal length . So a microsphere caught in such a trap is typi - cally near a microscope coverslip . Consequently , the hydro - dynamical interaction between the microsphere and the es - sentially inﬁnite surface of the coverslip must be accounted for . Faxe´n has done this for a sphere moving parallel to an inﬁnite plane with constant velocity in an incompressible ﬂuid bounded by the plane and asymptotically at rest at con - ditions of vanishing Reynold’s number . Solving perturba - tively in R / , , where , is the distance from the sphere’s cen - ter to the plane , Faxe´n found , 40 , 41 g Faxe´n ~ R / , ! 5 g 0 1 2 ~ 9 R / 16 , ! 1 ~ R 3 / 8 , 3 ! 2 ~ 45 R 4 / 256 , 4 ! 2 ~ R 5 / 16 , 5 ! 1 ﬂ . There is no second - order term in the denominator , so this formula remains good to within 1 % for , . 3 R if one ignores all but the ﬁrst - order term . This ﬁrst - order result was ﬁrst obtained by Lorentz . 42 If his ﬁrst - order calculation is re - peated for a sphere undergoing linear oscillating motion par - allel to a plane , one ﬁnds a friction formula that has Stokes’ and Lorentz’s as limiting cases 43 g ~ f , R / , ! 5 g Stokes ~ f !

The effect of the inﬁnite plane is to increase friction , but less so at larger frequencies where d is smaller . We measured , by ﬁrst focusing the microscope on the coverslip surface . Having established , 5 0 , the distance , to the bead was determined with software provided for the mi - croscope ~ Leica DM IRBE ! by Leica . The software com - putes the distance moved by the oil - immersion microscope objective . This distance multiplied with the ratio of the re - fractive index of water to that of glass , 1 . 33 / 1 . 5 , gives dis - tance , . The software gives , within precision of 0 . 1 m m , to which must be added the independent error for determination of , 5 0 , which is also 0 . 1 m m , we found , from repeated determinations . We had R / , ’ 1 / 12 when it was largest . So the bead’s hydrodynamic interaction with the coverslip has an effect of 4 % or less , large enough that we must account for it . Fortu - nately , this introduces no new ﬁtting parameters , because we know the value of , . Since , occurs only in a term of at most 4 % relative importance , any error in , value affects the ﬁnal result with a 0 . 04 times smaller error , in our case by one per mil , at most . XII . PHYSICAL POWER SPECTRUM By replacing g Stokes ( f ) with g ( f , R / , ) in Eqs . ~ 29 ! and ~ 31 ! , one obtains a power spectrum that accounts for all rel - evant physics of the bead in the trap , with the expected value P hydro ~ f ; R / , ! 5 D / ~ 2 p 2 !

We refer to this as the physical power spectrum . It dif - fers from the recorded power spectrum because the data ac - quisition system contains ﬁlters , some intended , some not , and because the data acquisition system samples the result - ing ﬁltered spectrum only at discrete times to produce the spectrum recorded . Below , we discuss the effects of ﬁltering and ﬁnite sampling frequency . XIII . POSITION DETECTION SYSTEM IS A LOW - PASS FILTER Silicon is transparent to infrared light . For this reason , position detection systems like ours have ﬁnite response times of the order of tens of microseconds . The delayed part of the signal decreases over time as a simple exponential , so our diode’s characteristics is a sum of two terms : 36 ~ i ! a 600 Rev . Sci .

The parameters a ( diode ) and f 3 dB ( diode ) depend on ~ i ! the la - ser’s wavelength and intensity , ~ ii ! the photodiode’s thick - ness , material properties , and reverse bias , and ~ iii ! line up of the laser beam and photodiode . 36 , 44 , 45 Consequently , the op - timal way in which to determine the values of f 3 dB ( diode ) and a ( diode ) relevant for a recorded spectrum is to include them with f c and D as third and fourth ﬁtting parameters in a ﬁt to the spectrum . The logic of this procedure is sound , even though we calibrate the position detection system with the same data from which we want to calibrate the trap ; see Appendix G for details . For the position detection system analyzed here , Eq . ~ 35 ! describes the ﬁltering effect of this system out to approxi - mately 30 kHz with the precision achieved here . We used zero reverse bias across the photodiode . With reverse bias , Eq . ~ 35 ! is good out to larger frequencies . In general , the ﬁltering effect of the position detection system at larger fre - quencies is described by a more complicated expression than Eq . ~ 35 ! , an expression that accounts also for faster decreas - ing solutions to the diffusion equation for charge carriers in the photodiode . 44 XIV . ALIASING AND ANTIALIASING FILTERS Sampling of the power spectrum with ﬁnite sampling rate causes aliasing . Data acquisition electronics typically have built - in antialiasing ﬁlters . Delta – sigma data conver - sion systems use oversampling and ‘‘noise - shaping’’ ﬁlters to eliminate aliasing altogether , and the effect of their built - in ﬁlters is only seen near their readout frequency . Section XIV can be skipped by those using such data acquisition systems . For others , aliasing , antialiasing ﬁlters , and how they relate are discussed in some detail in Appendix H . An important point made there is that antialiasing ﬁlters do not prevent all aliasing , they do not prevent the aliasing accounted for here with Eq . ~ 37 ! . Our data acquisition electronics have two built - in anti - aliasing ﬁlters , both ﬁrst - order ﬁlters with roll - off frequen - cies , f 3 dB , that we set as high as possible , 80 and 50 kHz , respectively . This is not the normal recommended setting , but it gives optimal conditions for observation of the physics of the problem and of unintentional ﬁltering by the position detection system . A ﬁrst - order ﬁlter reduces the power of its input , P 0 ( f ) , by a factor of P ~ f ! P 0 ~ f ! 5 1 1 1 ~ f / f 3 dB ! 2 . ~ 36 ! The effect of ﬁlters , intended or not , is accounted for by multiplying the physically correct power - spectral expected value in Eq . ~ 34 ! with the characteristic function for each ﬁlter , i . e . , with Eqs . ~ 35 ! and ~ 36 ! —the latter twice , once for each of our ﬁlters . That done , aliasing is accounted for by summing the result , P ( ﬁltered ) , over aliased frequencies , P ~ aliased ! ~ f ! 5 ( n 52 ‘ ‘ P ~ ﬁltered ! ~ f 1 nf sample ! , ~ 37 ! where in practice a ﬁnite number of terms exhausts the sum . The result , P ( aliased ) ( f ) , is our theory for the expected value of the experimental power spectrum recorded . XV . HOW TO CALIBRATE TWEEZERS The procedure described here in Sec . XV is implemented in freely available MATLAB software documented in Ref . 26 . The experimental spectrum to which we ﬁtted in Fig . 5 is the result of blocking 30 a spectrum that is the average of ﬁve spectra , which were calculated from ﬁve time series re - corded in ﬁve time windows , each with duration of 2 18 D t . 16 s ( D t 5 1 / f sample 5 1 / 16 000 s ) . Similarly , Fig . 6 is based on four such time windows , each with duration of 2 18 D t . 5 s ( D t 5 1 / f sample 5 1 / 50 000 s ) . In both cases consecutive windows were separated by several minutes . A study of power spectra and ﬁtted parameters obtained from individual windows showed that neither drifted between windows , al - though the center of the trap did . Thus it is legitimate to average over ﬁve / four spectra as we did . The spectrum thus obtained was blocked on the linear frequency axis to N 8 5 150 data points , with each block containing approximately 870 points . Before any blocking was done , crosstalk between channels was eliminated in the manner described in Appen - dix C . Our theory for the expected value of the power spectrum was ﬁtted to the recorded experimental power spectrum us - ing our theory for the scatter of the latter about the former : It scatters with standard deviation proportional to its expected value , i . e . , Eqs . ~ E4 ! and ~ E5 ! apply with n b replaced by n b n w , n w 5 5 ~ 4 ! , as described in Appendix E . Thus we ﬁt by minimizing x 2 5 ( k 5 1 N 8 S P k ~ ex ! 2 P k P k / A n w n b D 2 5 n w n b ( k 5 1 N 8 S P k ~ ex ! P k 2 1 D 2 , ~ 38 ! where the sum is over blocked data points and N 8 [ N / ( n w n b ) . The form of x 2 does not suit standard least - squares ﬁtting routines . However , exact rewriting yields a form that does , x 2 5 ( k 5 1 N 8 S P k 2 1 2 P k ~ ex ! 2 1 s k D 2 ~ 39 ! where s k 5 P k ( ex ) 2 1 / ( n w n b ) 1 / 2 .

The parameter values obtained from these least - squares ﬁts are listed in Tables II and III . We see that both the strength of the trap , in the form of f c , and conversion of the position detection sys - tem’s arbitrary units to nanometers , are determined to within 1 % precision or better . The latter conversion was found by 601 Rev . Sci . Instrum . , Vol . 75 , No . 3 , March 2004 Power spectrum analysis for optical tweezers Downloaded 25 Jun 2008 to 193 . 48 . 255 . 141 .

Thus , the force kD x exerted at distance D x from the center of the trap is known to within only 1 % – 2 % error due to calibration of the trap and diode . This error is typically negligible compared to the un - certainty of the position . Thus our calibration scheme essen - tially eliminates calibration errors from force measurements . The x coordinate in Table II should be compared with the results in Fig . 2 . They were obtained from the same data set . The two values for the corner frequency differ by four standard deviations , with the Lorentzian ﬁt yielding the lower value , because it absorbs the effect of unintentional ﬁltering in this manner , with a small systematic error as re - sult . This point is borne out in Table I and should be com - pared with Table III’s data for the x coordinate obtained from the same data set . The two values found for f 3 dB ( diode ) for the x and y coordi - nates , respectively , are indistinguishable in Table II as well as in Table III . This is what one would expect for a diode with four identical quadrants . It is a coincidence that the values differ only in the fourth digit , not shown in Table III . The two values found for f c , on the other hand , differ by three to four standard deviations . They differ by 2 % ~ 4 % ! , corresponding to an elliptical cross section of the beam with 1 % ~ 2 % ! difference between the lengths of the major and minor axes , or ellipticity of @ 1 2 ( 374 6 2 ) / ( 383 6 2 ) # 1 / 2 5 0 . 15 6 0 . 03 , $ @ 1 2 ( 666 6 5 ) / ( 637 6 5 ) # 1 / 2 5 0 . 21 6 0 . 04 % . This ellipticity does not differ signiﬁcantly from the 10 % maximum ellipticity of the laser beam promised by the manufacturer . Also , trap ellipticity and laser ellipticity are not necessarily the same thing . Polarized laser beams , even if perfectly nonelliptical , tend to get focused onto elliptical , diffraction limited spots in the image plane . This might be the source of differences between the trap stiffness ellipticity one measures and the laser beam ellipticity speciﬁed by the manufacturer . According to theory , the blocked experimental data points are statistically independent and normally distributed with known standard deviations . The ‘‘residual plot’’ in Fig . 5 ~ b ! @ 6 ~ b ! # shows the scatter about their expected value , ﬁt - ted theory , in units of this expectated value . Figures 5 ~ b ! and 6 ~ b ! show that the theoretical power spectrum presented here ﬁts the experimental one perfectly . Figures 5 ~ c ! and 6 ~ c ! provide a more radical illustration that the theoretical power spectrum used here really de - scribes the expected value of the experimental spectrum : The ‘‘raw’’ experimental spectral values , i . e . , unaveraged and un - blocked values , were divided with the ﬁtted theoretical value and binned into histograms that show that the raw experi - mental spectral values really are exponentially distributed about their expected value , as stated by theory . This is a powerful illustration of the correctness of the theory , as well as of the experiment : The histogram shows an exponential distribution over four decades obtained from experimental values that range over no less than seven decades : the four decades they scatter about their expected value , plus the three decades that this expected value varies with the fre - quency . XVI . DISCUSSION A . When precision is no concern In many biological experiments , e . g . , 10 % – 20 % calibra - tion error is of no concern because other sources of error are dominant . So the trapping force can be estimated with sufﬁcient—albeit unknown—precision with the roughest calibration based on a Lorentzian spectrum . Freely available MATLAB software 26 will do this as was shown in Sec . IV . B . When precision is a concern When precision is a concern an optical trap can advan - tageously be calibrated as was demonstrated above . Our recommendations—which we have implemented in freely available MATLAB software 26 —thus are the following . ~ a ! When plotting the experimental power spectrum , com - press data by blocking to show fewer data points with smaller scatter about their expected value . After all , we know a priori that the expected value is a smoothly varying function of the frequency . So the data can ad - vantageously reﬂect this . ~ b ! Plot P xy ~ deﬁned in Appendix C ! and use its minimal - ization as a criterion for good alignment of the diode with the laser beam . ~ c ! If P xy cannot be made to vanish , ﬁnd a linear coordi - nate transformation to a frame of reference in which it does vanish , and work in this frame of reference . ~ d ! The frequency dependence of the friction coefﬁcient and of the Brownian noise should be taken into ac - count . Not only is that correct theory , but using it costs nothing : No new ﬁtting parameters are introduced with it . ~ e ! Data acquisition electronics contain antialiasing ﬁlters . TABLE II .

If the ﬁlters are set to have minimal effect , that also minimizes the ef - fect of imprecise knowledge about these ﬁlters’ param - eter values . ~ f ! One should be aware that one’s position detection sys - tem may have frequency - dependent sensitivity , hence may act as an unintended low - pass ﬁlter . Ours , a Si PIN diode used with a 1064 nm laser , does , and it is by far the most important ﬁlter in our setup . However , since we know the form of its characteristic , we can calibrate its parameters from the very power spectrum we wanted to ﬁt . This is the optimal way in which to determine these parameters , because their values de - pend on experimental circumstances . If one calibrates with f max2 ! f 3 dB ( diode ) 2 , one should use the approximation in Eq . ~ G1 ! . If one uses another kind of quadrant pho - todiode and / or laser wavelength , this ﬁlter effect may be different or absent . 44 , 45 ~ g ! Aliasing due to ﬁnite sampling frequency always oc - curs , unless ones data acquisition system uses oversam - pling . Aliasing is easily accounted for , however , and doing so costs nothing if the theory one aliases is also correct at frequencies f . f Nyq that contribute through aliasing to the spectrum below f Nyq . No new ﬁtting parameters are introduced , only f Nyq , which is known to high precision . ~ h ! Leakage , 30 on the other hand , is truly negligible be - cause the power spectrum of a trapped bead is a smooth and slowly varying function . So there is no need to introduce window functions that reduce leak - age . Consequently , overlapping data windows that compensate for loss of information caused by window functions are also not needed . However , if built into one’s data acquisition software , they can be used as they were intended : for quick , on - line data compres - sion . The correlations they introduce in the resulting power spectrum are negligible if a very large number of windows is used . ~ i ! The scatter of experimental power spectral values about their expected values is known theoretically . So it costs nothing to use correct error bars , and doing so yields correct stochastic error bars on ﬁtted parameters such as f c and D , and , last but not least , use of correct error bars makes it possible to obtain statistical support for ﬁts . ~ j ! Plots like Figs . 1 , 2 ~ b ! , 5 ~ b ! and 5 ~ c ! , 6 ~ b ! and 6 ~ c ! , and 7 – 10 are well worth doing . They provide simple , strong , virtually model - independent checks that will catch many kinds of errors in one’s experiment and initial data analysis , if present . ~ k ! If the ﬁtted value of D is used to calibrate the length scale of displacements measured , one should be aware that the viscosity of the ﬂuid in which one measures may differ signiﬁcantly from that of pure water at the same temperature . If this is so , reliable calculation or measurement of its viscosity is needed , or a direct mea - surement of length scales by moving a ﬁxed bead with a piezo stage . ~ l ! Finally , one should beware that the procedure de - scribed here calibrates the center of the trap . This makes it valid anywhere near the center where the trap - ping potential is harmonic . That includes everywhere Brownian motion took our bead during calibration , it seems from Fig . 10 . How to calibrate off center , at a given displacement along the beam axis , is a separate project of practical interest , but was not addressed here .

We recorded a ‘‘dark spectrum , ’’ the power spectrum generated when the diode is kept in total darkness ; see Fig . 7 ~ a ! . This is a mea - surement of the equipment’s electronic noise . We see the spectrum is ﬂat , except for a spike at 50 Hz from the power supply , and at a few higher frequencies , 400 Hz in particular . All values are a factor of 10 2 – 10 4 below that of our calibra - tion spectra , hence noise may contribute from 1 % to 10 % to the spectra , since amplitudes , not spectra , add up . However , the spikes are so narrow and few in addition to being small that they do not matter statistically in our calibration spectra , and also do not show above their noise . The spike at ; 7 kHz was an exception , but it was so narrow that it easily was ﬁltered out manually and had negligible consequence for the statistics of the calibration spectrum . We also recorded a ‘‘light spectrum , ’’ see Fig . 7 ~ b ! . Compared with the dark spectrum , this light spectrum shows signiﬁcant low - frequency noise , plus a peak at 100 Hz , prob - ably caused by stray light . Apart from stray light , the differ - ence is caused by the limited pointing stability of the unscat - tered laser beam and the optics it passes through relative to the photodiode . The low - frequency noise seems to fall off as f 2 2 , which is what one would observe if the direction of the laser were doing a slow random walk about its average di - rection driven by white noise . Although only the microsphere is missing , this light spectrum is not a direct measurement of all noise in the system apart from the Brownian noise of the sphere . Me - chanical vibrations , e . g . , are transmitted to the ﬂuid volume , but not to the light spectrum because the ﬂuid is transparent . They are , however , transmitted by the ﬂuid to the sphere’s spectrum when the sphere is present . So this is noise that occurs in the experiment , but not in the light spectrum . Strictly speaking , the light spectrum therefore only provides a lower bound on ‘‘all noise but the sphere’s Brownian . ’’ It may nevertheless be a good approximation to all noise , al - though proof of this is missing . By choosing f min 5 110 Hz in calibration ﬁts , we leave low - frequency noise entirely out of the calibration . The light spectrum’s extra features relative to those in Fig . 7 ~ a ! above this f min value all fall a factor of 10 2 4 below the calibration spectrum’s power at the same frequencies , hence add less than 1 % to the calibration spectrum . FIG . 8 . Experimental power spectra for x and y coordinates ~ lower and upper data points , respectively ! . Points plotted here are averages over ‘‘blocks’’ of points from the original power spectrum ; see Appendix E . The error bars were calculated from data within blocks . Since the block intervals were chosen to be of equal size on the logarithmic frequency axis used here , the number of data points in a block grows exponentially with the frequency . Consequently , the error bars decrease exponentially with an increase in fre - quency , and range from small at low frequencies to nondiscernible at inter - mediate and large frequencies .

How to decorrelate channels The photodiode that we used to measure the bead’s po - sition consists of four quadrants , each of which outputs volt - age proportional to the amount of light impinging upon it . We number the quadrants I , II , III , and IV like the quadrants of a two - dimensional ~ 2D ! coordinate system , and denote their output voltages V I , V II , V III , and V IV . Then changes in the voltage and the ratios , V z [ V I 1 V II 1 V III 1 V IV , ~ C1 ! R x [ ~ V I 2 V II 2 V III 1 V IV ! / V z , ~ C2 ! R y [ ~ V I 1 V II 2 V III 2 V IV ! / V z , ~ C3 ! are , to good ﬁrst approximation , 35 , 46 – 48 proportional to changes in the bead’s position ( z , x , y ) , with z the coordinate along the laser beam’s axis . Figure 8 shows that this approximation is not adequate when precision is desired . The experimentally recorded ‘‘co - ordinates’’ R x ( t ) and R y ( t ) are not independent . Their power spectra , P x ( f ) [ u Rˆ x ( f ) u 2 and P y ( f ) [ u Rˆ y ( f ) u 2 , where the caret denotes discrete Fourier transformation , Eq . ~ 12 ! , are plotted in Fig . 8 , together with P xy ( f ) [ Re @ Rˆ x ( f ) Rˆ y * ( f ) # . When x and y are uncorrelated degrees of freedom , so are R x and R y , hence so are Rˆ x and Rˆ y . Consequently , P xy should vanish compared to P x and P y . We ﬁnd P xy ( f ) / @ P x ( f ) P y ( f ) # 1 / 2 ’ 3 % – 5 % , however , as shown in the inset in Fig . 8 . Two explanations for crosstalk given below suggest that ( R x , R y ) is a linear function of ( x , y ) , and vice versa , and that this function does not depend on time . Assuming this , we look for a linear transformation of ( R x , R y ) to a pair of coordinates ( x 8 , y 8 ) for which P x 8 y 8 5 0 . If we can ﬁnd such a transformation , it does not matter what motivated the search for it : the transformed coordinates are the correct Car - tesian coordinates in which to analyze the bead’s motion and calibrate the trap . To ﬁnd this transformation , we must ﬁnd two real constants , b and c , such that the time series , ~ x 8 ~ t ! , y 8 ~ t ! ! [ ~ R x ~ t ! 1 bR y ~ t ! , R y ~ t ! 1 cR x ~ t ! ! , ~ C4 ! has the property that P x 8 y 8 ( f ) 5 0 for all f . Clearly , constants b and c are greatly overdetermined . Nevertheless , we were able to ﬁnd them for all time series that we have analyzed , and have also found that the solution is almost degenerate . This is because P x ( f ) , P y ( f ) , and P xy ( f ) are nearly proportional to each other . It probably also helped that before we recorded any of the data used here , we aligned the diode with the laser beam using as the alignment TABLE IV .

We found ( b , c ) 5 ( 0 . 47 , 2 0 . 56 ) by minimizing ( f P x 8 y 8 ( f ) 2 / @ P x ( f ) P y ( f ) # with respect to b and c . As de - sired , we found that at the minimum P x 8 y 8 ( f ) / @ P x ( f ) P y ( f ) # 1 / 2 5 0 was satisﬁed for all f to within experimental error of this quantity ; see Fig . 9 . Having determined b and c in this manner , the resulting power spectra , P x 8 and P y 8 , for the uncoupled coordinates ( x 8 , y 8 ) are the spectra that we analyzed in the manner de - scribed in the body of this article . So we drop the prime from the notation hereafter , but it should always be understood implicity . 2 . Possible origins of crosstalk If the parabolic trapping potential V is perfectly rotation - ally symmetric about the beam axis ~ chosen as the z axis ! , V ( x 8 , y 8 , z ) 5 v ( x 8 2 1 y 8 2 , z ) , the bead’s equation of motion decouples no matter which pair of Cartesian coordinates ( x 8 , y 8 ) we use , as long as they are orthogonal to the beam axis . If the parabolic trap is not rotationally symmetric , but elliptic about the beam axis , decoupling is achieved in coor - dinates ( x 8 , y 8 ) that coincide with the major and minor axes of the ellipse . Figure 8 shows that P x and P y are approximately pro - portional to each other : The data set for one function is shifted vertically relative to the data set for the other function by an amount approximately independent of frequency f . This means that the two channels have nearly the same cor - ner frequency . So the trap is nearly rotationally symmetric . With an asymmetric trap excluded , the simplest explana - tion for the constant ratio between P x and P y is a difference in sensitivity of the photodiode with respect to the two di - rections . This would come about if the four quadrants of the diode are not identically sensitive , and this would also ex - plain the nonvanishing values for P xy , including its nearly constant ratio to P x and P y : R x becomes linearly correlated with R y if we introduce independent sensitivities s i for each of the quadrants , V i 5 s i L i , i 5 I , II , III , and IV , where L i is the amount of light impinging on the i th quadrant . If , e . g . , a spot of light moves in the x direction , L I 1 L II remains con - stant , as does L III 1 L IV and V z . The ratio R y changes value when s I (cid:222) s II and / or s III (cid:222) s IV , however . Note that such asym - metry needs not be a property of the diode itself . All four quadrants could be identical , but have a nonlinear relation - ship between input light intensity and output voltage . In that case , less - than - perfect centering of the laser beam on the diode will cause different amounts of light to fall on different quadrants , and hence make them respond with different sen - sitivity to the small changes in light that correspond to move - ment of the bead . Another explanation , which does not exclude the ﬁrst , could be small asymmetry in the spot of light scattered by the bead onto the photodiode . That would cause different amounts of light to shift between quadrants for identical shifts of the bead in the x and y directions . If , furthermore , some of that asymmetrically scattered light falls beyond the edge of the quadrant diode , then a shift of the bead in the x direction will change R y , and hence register as a correlated change in y . APPENDIX D : MODEL - INDEPENDENT DATA ANALYSIS Histograms of x and y positions of the decorrelated time series were consistent with a harmonic trapping potential up to 10 k B T , at least , as shown in Fig . 10 for the x channel . The parabola through the data in the lin – log plot shows that the data are modeled well with V ( x ) 5 12 k x 2 in the range of x values visited . It is very satisfying that a model - independent data analysis can point so precisely to a speciﬁc model . If we determined the value of k in this manner , how - ever , we may ﬁnd too low a value . This is because the true distribution } exp @ 2 V ( x ) / k B T # was smeared to a wider one by low - frequency vibrations which are external to the experi - ment in the sense that they do not originate in the bead’s thermal motion . We may also ﬁnd too large a value for k because low - pass frequency ﬁlters artiﬁcially narrow the dis - tribution of positions recorded . Furthermore , since ﬁts like that in Fig . 10 do not calibrate the position detection system , the units for x and y remain arbitrary until an independent calibration of the position detection system is carried out , e . g . , by ﬁnding f c . Force measurements would consequently contain errors that originate in that calibration as well , were we to do one . APPENDIX E : MAXIMUM - LIKELIHOOD FITTING AND DATA COMPRESSION Suppose we data compress a power spectrum by block - ing , and only then ﬁt to it . How should that be done , and what is the approximation introduced by this ? In an unprocessed ~ uncompressed ! power spectrum , the power spectral values are exponentially distributed . Least - squares ﬁtting presupposes that the data are Gaussian distrib - uted . With sufﬁcient compression , a spectrum whose values were exponentially distributed will turn into a spectrum with much less scatter and Gaussian distributed values by virtue of the central limit theorem . So after compression , least - squares ﬁtting can be applied . What is the approximation involved , we should ask , and what is the precision to expect , we must ask , in view of the precision we achieve in calibrat - ing to compressed spectra , and hence want to claim for the calibration method described . In order to answer these questions , we ﬁrst observe that maximum - likelihood ﬁtting to exponentially distributed data is equivalent to minimizing F [ 2 log p 5 ( k ~ P k ~ ex ! / P k 1 log P k ! . ~ E1 ! 607 Rev .

Note that n b D f P 8 ( f ¯ ) / P ( f ¯ ) is the relative change in P ( f ) across a block . Since D f 5 1 / T 5 0 . 06 Hz while P 8 ( f ) / P ( f ) 5 O ( f c 2 1 ) , it is possible to choose n b large , e . g . , n b 5 500 , and still have the last term in Eq . ~ E3 ! negligible , so that we are left with the same form as Eq . ~ E1 ! for maximum - likelihood estimation of the theory’s parameters from given , now blocked , experimental data . Calculation entirely like the one leading from Eqs . ~ E2 ! – ~ E3 ! shows that the expected value and RMSD for P¯ ( ex ) ( f¯ ) are ^ P¯ ~ ex ! ~ f¯ ! & 5 P ~ f¯ ! , ~ E4 ! s @ P¯ ~ ex ! ~ f¯ ! # 5 s @ P ~ ex ! ~ f¯ ! # / A n b 5 P ~ f¯ ! / A n b , ~ E5 ! to the orders in n b D f given . In this last identity , Eq . ~ E5 ! , if the power spectrum blocked was already windowed , its val - ues were not exponentially distributed , and n b should be re - placed with n w n b in the case of nonoverlapping rectangular windows , and with 9 n w n b / 11 in the case of Hanning win - dows ~ Ref . 30 , p . 428 ! . For large n b , or , if n w (cid:222) 1 , for large n w n b , the central limit theorem tells us that P¯ ( ex ) ( f¯ ) is Gaussian distributed with the expected value and root - mean - square deviations given in Eqs . ~ E4 ! and ~ E5 ! . Fitting to data that are known to be Gaussian distributed is usually done with the method of least squares . So it is natural to ask how the method of least squares relates to the maximum - likelihood estimation dis - cussed above . According to Eq . ~ E3 ! with its last term ne - glected , maximum - likelihood estimation based on blocked data amounts to minimization of F ¯ [ n b ( f¯ S P¯ ~ ex ! ~ f¯ ! P ~ f¯ ! 1 log P ~ f ¯ ! D . ~ E6 ! A brief calculation shows that this is equivalent to minimi - zation of F ¯ 2 [ 1 2 x 2 1 ( f ¯ log P ~ f¯ ! , ~ E7 ! where x 2 [ n b ( f¯ S P¯ ~ ex ! ~ f¯ ! 2 P ~ f¯ ! P ~ f¯ ! D 2 . ~ E8 ! F ¯ 2 is precisely the expression one must minimize with re - spect to ﬁtting parameters in the function P when these pa - rameters are maximum likelihood estimated from a set of experimental data @ f¯ , P¯ ( ex ) ( f¯ ) # f¯ , . . . , that are normally distrib - uted with the theoretical expected value and root - mean - square deviation given in Eqs . ~ E4 ! and ~ E5 ! . Thus we see that maximum - likelihood estimation of P simpliﬁes to x 2 minimization only when n b is so large that one can ignore the last term in Eq . ~ E7 ! compared to the ﬁrst . This last term occurs because our theory gives both the ex - pected value for the data and the data’s root - mean - square deviation for this expected value . Thus the parameters of our theory occur also in the root - mean - square deviation , the logarithm of which is the second term in F ¯ 2 above . In text - book derivations of ordinary least - squares ﬁtting , this term is independent of the ﬁtted theory’s parameters , e . g . , because experimentally measured error bars are used , hence only the ﬁrst term , x 2 , is minimized . Since n b n w ranged from 2500 to 4350 in our data analy - sis , we could neglect the second term in F ¯ 2 relative to the ﬁrst term , and ﬁt by minimizing only x 2 . Factors other than this approximation limited our precision . However , with data and equipment other than those discussed here , we have en - countered situations where x 2 ﬁtting clearly was not ad - equate , and we had to minimize the full expression for F ¯ 2 . 44 APPENDIX F : CALCULATION OF s (cid:132) f c (cid:133) Equations ~ 25 ! and ~ 27 ! give f c as a function of the experimental power spectrum ( P k ( ex ) ) k 5 1 , . . . , N 8 .

APPENDIX G : FITTING f 3 dB (cid:132) diode (cid:133) AND a (cid:132) diode (cid:133) The ﬁt shown in Fig . 5 gives f c 5 0 . 37 kHz and f 3 dB ( diode ) 5 6 . 8 kHz , i . e . , the latter is 19 times larger than the former . So the values of these two frequencies are sensitive to dif - ferent parts of the power spectrum . This does not mean that the covariances between f c , on the one hand , and f 3 dB ( diode ) and a ( diode ) on the other , are negligible . Both f c and f 3 dB ( diode ) , for example , depend on a large range of frequencies , and conse - quently have signiﬁcant covariance for realistic values of both . This is seen when ﬁtting using a program that gives correlations , and can also be shown analytically for a Lorent - zian ﬁt with f c ! f max & f 3 dB ( diode ) ! f Nyq in a calculation analo - gous to the one done in Appendix F ; see Sec . G 1 below . In units of s ( f c ) s ( f 3 dB ( diode , eff ) ) , one ﬁnds that the covariance of f c and f 3 dB ( diode , eff ) is 2 2 ( f c / f 3 dB ( diode , eff ) ) 1 / 2 , which takes values of 2 0 . 46 and 2 0 . 47 for the values of f c and f 3 dB ( diode , eff ) that we found above ~ Fig . 5 , Table II ! for the x and the y coordi - nates , respectively . In view of the approximation involved , this is in good agreement with the values of 2 0 . 55 and 2 0 . 54 found by the ﬁtting program for the covariance be - tween f c and f 3 dB ( diode ) in units of s ( f c ) s ( f 3 dB ( diode ) ) . The agree - ment is even better for the data set whose x - coordinate data are shown in Fig . 6 . The ﬁt shown there and the equivalent one for the y coordinate give 2 0 . 56 , respectively , 2 0 . 55 , for the correlation between f c and f 3 dB ( diode ) in units of s ( f c ) s ( f 3 dB ( diode ) ) . This compares very well with the analytical result 2 2 ( f c / f 3 dB ( diode , eff ) ) 1 / 2 52 0 . 59 , respectively , 2 0 . 58 , for the covariance between f c and f 3 dB ( diode , eff ) in units of s ( f c ) s ( f 3 dB ( diode , eff ) ) . Since the covariance in units of s ( f c ) s ( f 3 dB ( diode , eff ) ) is 2 2 ( f c / f 3 dB ( diode , eff ) ) 1 / 2 in our analytical case based on Lorentz - ians , we see that one needs an unrealistically small ratio for f c / f 3 dB ( diode ) in order to have negligible covariance between these two parameters . We also see that because of their sub - stantial covariance one cannot determine one correctly with - out determining the other with similar precision . Because of our rich data and well - ﬁtting theory , we determine both f c and f 3 dB ( diode ) with the high precision listed in Tables II and III . This precision refers to the 68 % probability interval for the parameter in question , with the values for the other three parameters ﬂoating ; i . e . , it is the most conservative , largest interval . So our procedure is quite sound despite the nonva - nishing covariance of f c with f 3 dB ( diode ) . 609 Rev . Sci .

Low - frequency approximation for the diode characteristic function From Tables II and III we see that less than 10 % of the power in the spectrum , a ( diode ) 2 , is unaffected by the ﬁnite response time of the diode . In this case , and for frequencies f for which ( f / f 3 dB ( diode ) ) 2 ! 1 , we have P ~ f ! P 0 ~ f ! 5 1 1 a ~ diode ! 2 ~ f / f 3 dB ~ diode ! ! 2 1 1 ~ f / f 3 dB ~ diode ! ! 2 , ~ G1 ! ’ 1 1 1 ~ f / f 3 dB ~ diode , eff ! ! 2 , where we have introduced f 3 dB ~ diode , eff ! [ ~ 1 2 a ~ diode ! 2 ! 2 ~ 1 / 2 ! f 3 dB ~ diode ! . ~ G2 ! The last expression in Eq . ~ G1 ! is a simple Lorentzian . Equa - tion ~ G2 ! shows that in this case a ( diode ) combines with f 3 dB ( diode ) into a single parameter , f 3 dB ( diode , eff ) , an effective 3 dB frequency of a ﬁrst - order ﬁlter that describes the diode’s characteristics . One can use this approximation in a calculation analo - gous to the one done in Appendix F to obtain the analytical result used above : the covariance of f c and f 3 dB ( diode , eff ) , in units of s ( f c ) s ( f 3 dB ( diode , eff ) ) , is 2 2 ( f c / f 3 dB ( diode , eff ) ) 1 / 2 . APPENDIX H : ALIASING AND ANTIALIASING 1 . What aliasing is When a signal is sampled at discrete times , t j , with fre - quency f sample , the sampling process cannot distinguish fre - quency components of the signal which differ from each other by integer multiples of the sampling frequency . They all add up to a single amplitude . This is seen as follows : Our experiment records a time series ( x j ) j 5 1 , . . . , N by sampling the continuous signal x ( t ) with frequency f sample for time T msr . With x˜ k the continuous Fourier transformed in Eq . ~ 7 ! , the continuous signal can be written in terms of its inverse Fou - rier transform , x ~ t ! 5 1 T msr ( n 52 ‘ ‘ e 2 i 2 p tk / N x˜ k . ~ H1 ! Inserting this in the discrete Fourier transform of our re - corded time series , Eq . ~ 12 ! , and using 1 N ( j 5 1 N e i 2 p j ~ k 2 , ! / N 5 ( n 52 ‘ ‘ d k 2 , , nN , ~ H2 ! where the right - hand side is equal to 1 for k 5 , modulo N , and 0 otherwise , we ﬁnd xˆ k 5 ( n 52 ‘ ‘ x˜ k 1 nN . ~ H3 ! Here the real and imaginary parts of x˜ k 1 nN are uncorrelated random Gaussian variables with zero mean and common variance in both the Einstein – Ornstein – Uhlenbeck theory and the hydrodynamically correct theory , and for ﬁltered ver - sions of both theories . Hence , so are the real and imaginary parts of xˆ k . Consequently , P k ~ ex , aliased ! [ u xˆ k u 2 / T msr ~ H4 ! is exponentially distributed on the real , non - negative num - bers , with mean P k ~ aliased ! 5 ^ u xˆ k u 2 & / T msr , 5 ( n 52 ‘ ‘ ^ u x˜ k 1 nN u 2 & / T msr , 5 ( n 52 ‘ ‘ P k 1 nN . ~ H5 ! P ( aliased ) is obviously a periodic function of k with period N , i . e . , of f k with period f sample . So it is sufﬁcient to know its value in the interval @ 2 f Nyq , f Nyq # , f Nyq 5 f sample / 2 . On the other hand , Eq . ~ H5 ! shows that neither f Nyq nor f sample represents a sharp frequency cutoff . The value of P k ( aliased ) depends through P k 1 nN ( unaliased ) , n 56 1 , 6 2 , . . . , on fre - quency components x˜ k of the signal x ( t ) outside @ 2 f Nyq , f Nyq # . 2 . Example : Aliased Lorentzian As a speciﬁc example , we consider the Lorentzian , for which P k ~ aliased ! 5 ( n 52 ‘ ‘ D / ~ 2 p 2 ! f c 2 1 ~ f k 1 nf sample ! 2 5 ~ D x ! 2 D t 1 1 c 2 2 2 c cos ~ 2 p k / N ! . ~ H6 ! In the case of f c ! f , f Nyq , P ( f ) } 1 / f 2 , hence P N / 2 ~ aliased ! } ( n 52 ‘ ‘ 1 ~ f Nyq 1 2 nf Nyq ! 2 , 5 2 f Nyq2 S 1 1 1 9 1 1 25 1 1 49 1 1 81 1 ﬂ D ’ 2 . 47 f Nyq 2 , ~ H7 ! i . e . , aliasing adds almost 150 % to the power spectrum near f Nyq . This means that frequencies several times f Nyq contrib - ute signiﬁcantly to the power spectrum near f Nyq , no matter what value f Nyq has , and one must consequently consider whether the model yielding the Lorentzian really is also valid at these higher frequencies , even if the model is known to be valid below f Nyq . 3 . What antialiasing is Data acquisition electronics have built - in antialiasing ﬁl - ters . These ﬁlters prevent aliasing of electronic noise from much higher frequencies . However , if not all 3 dB frequen - cies of these ﬁlters are much larger than our highest fre - quency of interest , the power spectrum we want to measure is distorted by antialiasing . Since f 3 dB 5 f Nyq is a popular choice , this distortion commonly occurs and is signiﬁcant ; see Fig . 11 . 610 Rev . Sci . Instrum . , Vol . 75 , No . 3 , March 2004 K . Berg - Sørensen and H . Flyvbjerg Downloaded 25 Jun 2008 to 193 . 48 . 255 . 141 . Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright ; see http : / / rsi . aip . org / rsi / copyright . jsp It should be avoided when possible by choosing high values for f 3 dB . Electronic noise must be ﬁltered away , but this should be done with minimal effect on the information - containing part of the power spectrum . Although any anti - aliasing ﬁlter is easily accounted for in principle when its characteristic function is known , in practice parameter values of the characteristic function are not known with precision . However , if the ﬁlter settings are chosen to minimize ﬁlter - ing , the uncertainty that this lack of precision causes , appears on subdominant digits that describe an already small effect . So this lack of precision may not matter . 4 . What antialiasing is not Antialiasing ﬁlters are no substitute for a correct descrip - tion of the aliasing caused by ﬁnite sampling time , as Fig . 11 illustrates : If the theoretical power spectrum for a system is a simple Lorentzian , but the signal from this system is sampled at a ﬁnite rate , an aliased Lorentzian results . This is then what one should ﬁt to the experimental spectrum . If one ﬁlters the signal before sampling it , say , with f 3 dB 5 f Nyq , that should also be accounted for . However , one should not assume that the ﬁlter prevents the aliasing caused by ﬁnite sampling time , and then ﬁt a simple Lorentzian to the spec - trum of the ﬁltered , sampled signal , to frequencies up to f Nyq . Not if 20 % error matters , because the two spectra dif - fer by that much for 0 . 6 f Nyq , f , 0 . 8 f Nyq . If one ﬁts only to frequencies below f max 5 0 . 6 f Nyq , a simple Lorentzian is about as bad an approximation to the ﬁltered time series as to the unﬁltered one . So in this range also is antialiasing no substitute for a theory that accounts for ﬁlters and sampling rates . 1 A . Ashkin , Proc . Natl . Acad . Sci . U . S . A . 94 , 4853 ~ 1997 ! . 2 S . M .
