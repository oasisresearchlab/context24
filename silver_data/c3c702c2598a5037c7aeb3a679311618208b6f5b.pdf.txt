Epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) kinase undergoes transactivation upon stretch , integrin en - gagement , and AT1 receptor activation and , in turn , stimulates NADPH oxidase . Therefore , we tested whether Cl − SAC is regulated by EGFR kinase signaling and is volume sensitive . Paramagnetic beads coated with mAb for β 1 in - tegrin were attached to myocytes and pulled with an electromagnet . Stretch activated a Cl − SAC that was 1 . 13 ± 0 . 10 pA / pF at + 40 mV . AG1478 ( 10 μ M ) , an EGFR kinase blocker , inhibited 93 ± 13 % of Cl − SAC , and intracellu - lar pretreatment with 1 μ M AG1478 markedly suppressed Cl − SAC activation . EGF ( 3 . 3 nM ) directly activated an outwardly rectifying Cl − current ( 0 . 81 ± 0 . 05 pA / pF at + 40 mV ) that was fully blocked by 10 μ M tamoxifen , an I Cl , swell blocker . Phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( PI - 3K ) is downstream of EGFR kinase . Wortmannin ( 500 nM ) and LY294002 ( 100 μ M ) , blockers of PI - 3K , inhibited Cl − SAC by 67 ± 6 % and 91 ± 25 % respectively , and the EGF - induced Cl − current also was fully blocked by LY294002 . Furthermore , gp91ds - tat ( 500 nM ) , a cell - permeable , chi - meric peptide that specifi cally blocks NADPH oxidase assembly , profoundly inhibited the EGF - induced Cl − current . Inactive permeant and active impermeant control peptides had no effect . Myocyte shrinkage with hyperosmotic bathing media inhibited the Cl − SAC and EGF - induced Cl − current by 88 ± 9 % and 127 ± 11 % , respectively . These results suggest that β 1 integrin stretch activates Cl − SAC via EGFR , PI - 3K , and NADPH oxidase , and that both the Cl − SAC and the EGF - induced Cl − currents are likely to be the volume - sensitive Cl − current , I Cl , swell .

The β 1D - splice variant is the principal integrin iso - form expressed in adult mammalian heart ( Zhidkova et al . , 1995 ) . We have shown that specifi c stretch of β 1 integrin in ventricular myocytes under isosmotic con - ditions activates an outwardly rectifying Cl − current ( Cl − SAC ) ( Browe and Baumgarten , 2003 , 2004 ) that resembles the volume - sensitive Cl − current , I Cl , swell ( Sorota , 1992 ; Tseng , 1992 ) . Cl − SAC , like I Cl , swell , con - tributes to the background current , activates slowly over several minutes , exhibits outward rectifi cation , partially inactivates at positive potentials , and is blocked by tamoxifen . Regulation of Cl − SAC involves Src and / or focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) , angiotensin AT1 receptors , and reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) gen - erated , at least in part , by NADPH oxidase . Further - more , angiotensin II ( AngII ) and H 2 O 2 each elicit Cl − SAC in ventricular myocytes in the absence of stretch ( Browe and Baumgarten , 2004 ) . Stretch ( Oeckler et al . , 2003 ) , integrins ( Moro et al . , 2002 ) , and AT1 receptors ( Shah and Catt , 2003 ) trans - activate epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) kinase , a member of the ErbB family of receptor tyro - sine kinases ( RTKs ) . Unstimulated EGFR kinase is a monomer consisting of an extracellular ligand binding domain , a single membrane spanning domain , and a cytoplasmic kinase domain ( Holbro and Hynes , 2004 ) . With ligand binding , EGFR kinase dimerizes , trans - autophosphorylates six specifi c tyrosines within its non - catalytic cytoplasmic tail , and translocates from caveolae to costameres ( Shah , 2002 ) . EGFR kinase then recruits and phosphorylates various adaptor and signaling mol - ecules that bind phosphotyrosine motifs with their SH2 and PTB domains and serves as a platform for integrat - ing downstream signaling . Signaling by EGFR kinase and AT1 receptors is medi - ated by phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( PI - 3K ) , a family of lipid kinases also activated by integrins , stretch , and H 2 O 2 ( Ushio - Fukai et al . , 1999 ; Oudit et al . , 2004 ) . The best characterized PI - 3K are heterodimers composed 238 Signaling Cascade Regulating Cl − SAC of a p110 catalytic subunit tightly coupled to a regula - tory subunit . Cardiac myocytes principally express the p110 α and γ isoforms that couple with the p85 and p101 regulatory subunits , respectively ( Prasad et al . , 2003 ; Oudit et al . , 2004 ) . The p110 α - p85 and p110 γ - p101 dimers are activated by interaction with phosphotyro - sines or the βγ subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins , respectively , and catalyze inositol ring phosphorylation at the D - 3 position to produce phosphatidylinositol 3 , 4 , 5 - triphosphate ( PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ) and phosphatidyl - inositol 3 , 4 - bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 ) , potent sig - naling molecules . EGFR kinase and PI - 3K also participate in the activa - tion of NADPH oxidase ( Seshiah et al . , 2002 ; Vignais , 2002 ) . Cardiac myocytes express a transmembrane fl avocytochrome b 558 complex consisting of gp91 phox ( Nox2 ) and p22 phox , as well as the cytosolic components p47 phox , p67 phox , and Rac ( Li et al . , 2002 ; Xiao et al . , 2002 ; Heymes et al . , 2003 ) . Nox4 , a homologue of gp91 phox , also is expressed ( Byrne et al . , 2003 ) . NADPH oxidase activation involves translocation of the cyto - solic components to the membrane and their assembly with fl avocytochrome b 558 ( Vignais , 2002 ) . Once assem - bled , the NADPH oxidase complex uses intracellular NADPH as substrate to catalyze the single electron reduction of molecular O 2 to superoxide anion , ⋅ O 2 − , which is subsequently converted to H 2 O 2 by superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) . Assembly of the active NADPH oxidase requires the binding of gp91 phox to p47 phox ( Vignais , 2002 ) . Recently , a cell permeable , chimeric peptide that inhibits this in - teraction was developed ( Rey et al . , 2001 ) . The inhibi - tor , gp91ds - tat , combines the 9 - mer gp91 phox docking sequence for p47 phox with a 9 - mer from the HIV tat sequence that mediates membrane permeation . gp91 ds - tat can be used to selectively evaluate the role of NADPH oxidase in regulating Cl − SAC without affect - ing ROS production at other sites , such as the fl avocyto - chromes within the mitochondria . The aim of this study was to examine the role of EGFR kinase , PI - 3K , and NADPH oxidase in the activation of Cl − SAC in ventricular myocytes and to determine whether Cl − SAC is volume sensitive . Paramagnetic beads coated with anti – β 1 integrin mAb were used to stretch integrins . Block of EGFR kinase or PI - 3K during stretch inhibited Cl − SAC . Moreover , exogenous epider - mal growth factor ( EGF ) fully activated Cl − SAC , and the EGF - induced current was inhibited by PI - 3K and NADPH oxidase blockers and by tamoxifen , a blocker of I Cl , swell . Finally , Cl − SAC elicited by either integrin stretch or exogenous EGF was volume sensitive and was completely inhibited by osmotic shrinkage . Thus , the Cl − SAC and EGF - induced Cl − current are likely to be carried by the same channel as I Cl , swell . A preliminary report appeared previously ( Browe and Baumgarten , 2005b ) . M AT E R I A L S A N D M E T H O D S Ventricular Myocyte Isolation Left ventricular myocytes were freshly isolated from adult New Zealand white rabbits ( (cid:9) 3 kg ) of either gender . Hearts were ex - cised , attached to a Langendorff perfusion apparatus , and sub - jected to an enzymatic dissociation procedure described previously ( Browe and Baumgarten , 2003 ) . Isolated myocytes were washed and stored in a modifi ed KB medium . All experimental record - ings were conducted within 10 h of myocyte isolation . Single myo - cytes chosen for study were rod - shaped , quiescent , displayed clear striations , and were free of membrane blebs or other morphologi - cal irregularities . Tyrode solution for cell isolation contained ( in mM ) 130 NaCl , 5 KCl , 1 . 8 CaCl 2 , 0 . 4 KH 2 PO 4 , 3 MgCl 2 , 5 HEPES , 15 taurine , 5 creatine , 10 glucose , pH 7 . 25 ( adjusted with NaOH ) . CaCl 2 was replaced with 0 . 1 mM Na 2 - EGTA to make Ca 2 + - free Tyrode solu - tion . Enzyme solution contained 1 . 5 – 1 . 75 mg / ml BSA ( Sigma - Aldrich ; A7906 ) , 0 . 5 mg / ml collagenase ( type II , Worthington ) , and 0 . 05 mg / ml pronase ( Sigma - Aldrich ; type XIV ) in nominally Ca 2 + - Tyrode solution without EGTA . All isolation solutions were well oxygenated and maintained at 37 ° C . Modifi ed KB medium contained ( in mM ) 120 K - glutamate , 10 KCl , 10 KH 2 PO 4 , 0 . 5 K 2 - EGTA , 10 taurine , 1 . 8 MgSO 4 , 10 HEPES , 20 glucose , 10 manni - tol , pH 7 . 2 ( adjusted with KOH ) . Experimental Solutions and Drugs Single ventricular myocytes were scattered on a poly - l - lysine – coated , glass - bottomed chamber and placed on the stage of an inverted microscope ( Diaphot ; Nikon ) . Hoffman modula - tion optics ( × 40 ; NA = 0 . 55 ) and a high resolution TV camera ( CCD72 ; Dage - MTI ) were used to visualize the cells . Bath solution designed to isolate anion currents was suprafused at 2 – 3 ml / min and contained ( in mM ) 145 N - methyl - d - glucamine ( NMDG ) - Cl , 4 . 3 MgCl 2 , 10 HEPES , 5 glucose , pH 7 . 4 ( adjusted with NMDG ) . Pipette solution contained ( in mM ) 110 Cs - aspartate , 20 CsCl , 2 . 5 Mg - ATP , 8 Cs 2 - EGTA , 0 . 1 CaCl 2 , 10 HEPES , pH 7 . 1 ( adjusted with CsOH ; liquid junction potential , − 13 . 2 mV ) . Pipette free - Ca 2 + was estimated to be (cid:9) 35 nM ( WinMAXC 2 . 4 ; www . stanford . edu / ~ cpatton / maxc . html ) . All recordings were made at room temperature ( 22 ° C – 23 ° C ) . The tyrphostin AG1478 ( 1 mM ; Calbiochem ) , tamoxifen ( 20 mM ; Sigma - Aldrich ) , wortmannin ( 1 mM , Calbiochem ) , and LY294002 ( 50 mM , Calbiochem ) were prepared as stock solutions in DMSO at the indicated concentrations and kept frozen ( − 20 ° C ) in small aliquots until use . EGF ( mouse ; Cal - biochem ) was dissolved directly in bath solution and kept fro - zen ( − 20 ° C ) in small aliquots until use at a fi nal concentration of 3 . 3 nM , which is equivalent to 20 ng / ml . A membrane - permeant inhibitor of NADPH oxidase , gp91ds - tat , an inactive membrane - permeant analogue , scramb - tat , and an active but impermeant gp91ds peptide were synthesized by the Tufts Uni - versity Core Facility , as previously described by others ( Rey et al . , 2001 ) . The inhibitor , gp91ds - tat , is a fusion peptide made from a 9 - mer , CSTRIRRQL , that inhibits assembly of NADPH oxidase by mimicking the gp91 phox docking site for the cytoplas - mic p47 phox subunit and a 9 - mer from the tat HIV coat protein that confers membrane permeability . The gp91 phox docking site sequence is identical in a number of experimental species in - cluding rabbit ( Gauss et al . , 2002 ) , but experimental evidence and homology suggest that gp91ds - tat may not distinguish between gp91 phox homologues ( Rey et al . , 2001 ) . The inactive fusion peptide , scramb - tat , was made by scrambling the 9 - mer docking peptide to minimize matches in the GenBank / EMBL / DDBJ database , whereas gp91ds is the docking site 9 - mer without tat and is active in broken cell systems . Each peptide was prepared as stock solutions ( 1 . 2 mg / ml ) in 150 mM NaCl Browe and Baumgarten 239 acidifi ed with 10 mM acetic acid and kept frozen ( − 20 ° C ) in small aliquots until use . For certain experiments , bath solution osmolarity was increased from 300 mosmol / kg ( 1T ) to 450 mosmol / kg ( 1 . 5T ) by addition of mannitol , preserving a con - stant ionic strength . Integrin Stretch Force was applied directly and specifi cally to β 1 integrins using mAb - coated paramagnetic beads and an electromagnet , as pre - viously described ( Browe and Baumgarten , 2003 ) . mAb for the β 1 subunit of integrin ( MAB2250 , IgG 1 ; Chemicon ) was attached by anti – pan IgG mAb to the surface of uniform 4 . 5 ± 0 . 2 μ m diameter ( mean ± SD ) superparamagnetic beads containing iron oxides ( dynabeads M - 450 pan mouse IgG ; Dynal Biotech ) . Anti - β 1 integrin mAb – coated beads were added to myocytes in the bath and were permitted to randomly settle on myocytes from above while the fl ow of bath solution was turned off . Af - ter (cid:9) 5 min , unbound beads were washed away by restoring fl ow . Myocytes chosen for study typically had three to fi ve coated beads on their surface , and presumably , each bead was bound to mul - tiple β 1 integrins . A water - cooled electromagnet was placed directly on top of the bath , and patch pipettes were passed through an opening at the base of the coil . Current through the coil was set to generate a magnetic fl ux density of 35 Gauss ( G ) and a magnetic fl ux den - sity gradient of 2 , 400 G / m that was uniform in the x – y plane occupied by the myocytes on the chamber fl oor . The resulting force vector imposed on each bead was directed upwards toward the coil , perpendicular to the long axis of the myocyte , and was estimated to have a magnitude of 1 . 2 pN / bead ( Browe and Baumgarten , 2003 ) . Electrophysiological Recordings Pipettes were pulled from 7740 thin - walled borosilicate glass capillary tubing ( Sutter ) and fi re polished to give a fi nal tip diameter of 3 – 4 μ m and resistance in bath solution of 2 – 3 M Ω . Membrane currents were recorded with an EPC - 7 amplifi er ( List - Medical ) using the whole cell confi guration . A 150 mM KCl agar bridge served as the ground electrode . Seal resistances of 5 – 30 G Ω were typically obtained . Membrane potential was corrected for the measured liquid junction potential before forming a seal . After seal formation , the membrane patch was ruptured by application of negative pressure or by a brief zapping pulse . Myocytes were dialyzed for at least 10 min before recordings commenced . Voltage clamp protocols and data acquisition were governed by a Digidata 1200B or 1322A and pClamp 8 . 0 ( Axon Instruments ) . Successive 500 - ms voltage steps were taken from a holding potential of − 60 mV to test potentials ranging from − 100 to + 40 mV in + 10 mV increments . Membrane currents were low - pass fi ltered at 2 kHz ( 8 - pole Bessel 902 , Frequency Devices ) and digitized at 10 kHz . For presentation , selected records were low - pass fi ltered at 50 Hz post - digitization with a Gaussian fi lter in PClamp . Cl − currents exhibited strong voltage - dependent inactivation , and isochronal IV curves were plotted based on the average current recorded 20 – 35 ms after the onset of the voltage step . Statistics Data are reported as mean ± SEM ; n denotes the number of cells . Mean currents are expressed as current density ( pA / pF ) to ac - count for differences in myocyte surface membrane area , and paired comparisons usually are expressed as a percentage . Statis - tical analyses were performed by SigmaStat 3 . 1 ( Systat ) . For mul - tiple comparisons , a one - way repeated measures ANOVA was performed and was followed by a Student - Newman - Keuls test . For comparisons of two groups , a one - tailed paired Students t test was conducted . In both cases , P < 0 . 05 was taken as signifi cant . R E S U LT S EGFR Kinase Participates in Cl − SAC Activation Integrins , AT1 receptors , and mechanical stretch initi - ate transactivation of EGFR kinase ( Moro et al . , 2002 ; Oeckler et al . , 2003 ; Shah and Catt , 2003 ) . Because EGFR kinase serves as a nexus for integrating diverse stimuli that regulate Cl − SAC , we assessed its role in the response to β 1 integrin stretch . Fig . 1 illustrates families of anion currents at test potentials between − 100 and + 40 mV and the corresponding I – V relationships . Un - der control conditions with anti - β 1 integrin mAb – coated paramagnetic beads attached to the myocyte surface but before the application of integrin stretch , a small outwardly rectifying background current that partially inactivated at positive potentials was present ( Fig . 1 A ) . The background current reversed at − 49 mV , which is near the calculated value of − 52 mV for E Cl ( Fig . 1 D ) . Partial activation of I Cl , swell is thought to occur under these conditions , and the background Cl − current is sensitive to the I Cl , swell blocker tamoxifen ( Hume et al . , 2000 ) . Consequently , I Cl , swell is likely to comprise much of the background Cl − current observed in 1T . Stretch Figure 1 . AG1478 , a specifi c EGFR kinase blocker , inhibits Cl − SAC but does not affect background current in the absence of stretch . Families of currents recorded before ( A , Control ) and after ( B , Stretch ) activation of Cl − SAC by β 1 integrin stretch ( 5 min ) , and after addition of AG1478 ( 10 μ M , 10 min ) to the bath with continued stretch ( C , + AG1478 ) . Holding potential , − 60 mV ; test potentials , − 100 to + 40 mV ; step duration , 500 ms . Horizontal bar denotes 0 current . ( D ) I - V relationships for A – C ; each reversed near − 50 mV ( E Cl = − 52 mV ) . ( E ) I - V relationships com paring AG1478 - sensitive current after stretch ( Stretch - AG1478 ) and the AG1478 - sensitive background current ( Control - AG1478 ) in the absence of stretch in different myocytes . At + 40 mV , stretch - induced Cl − current was 1 . 13 ± 0 . 10 pA / pF , and AG1478 reduced Cl − SAC by 93 ± 13 % ( n = 4 , P = 0 . 001 ) but did not affect back - ground current ( n = 4 ; P = 0 . 526 ) in unstretched myocytes . 240 Signaling Cascade Regulating Cl − SAC of β 1 integrins progressively increased the magnitude of the outward Cl − current over 5 min , giving a more than twofold augmentation of outward current at + 40 mV in this example ( Fig . 1 , B and D ) . After full activation by stretch , the Cl − current partially inactivated at positive potentials , and its I – V relationship showed strong out - ward rectifi cation and reversed near E Cl , as previously shown ( Browe and Baumgarten , 2003 , 2004 ) . Block of EGFR kinase with 10 μ M AG1478 , a selective inhibitor ( Levitzki and Gazit , 1995 ) , almost completely abrogated the stretch - induced Cl − current in the con - tinued presence of integrin stretch ( Fig . 1 , C and E ) . The I – V relationship was nearly restored to its control level after 10 min , and the reversal potential was unaf - fected . Overall , integrin stretch increased the Cl − cur - rent at + 40 mV from 1 . 33 ± 0 . 07 to 2 . 30 ± 0 . 22 pA / pF , and exposure to AG1478 ( 10 – 12 min ) with continued integrin stretch reduced the current to 1 . 46 ± 0 . 17 pA / pF ( n = 4 ) . Thus , block of EGFR kinase inhibited 93 ± 13 % ( n = 4 , P = 0 . 001 ) of stretch - induced current at + 40 mV , and the current after block was not signifi - cantly different from the control current ( n = 4 , P = 0 . 385 ) . Neither stretch of β 1 integrin nor subsequent AG1478 application signifi cantly altered inward current at − 100 mV , however , as also was shown for stretch ( Browe and Baumgarten , 2003 , 2004 ) . As a control , we examined the effect of AG1478 ( 10 μ M , 10 min ) on the background Cl − current in the absence of integrin stretch . In contrast to its pronounced inhibi - tory effect on the stretch - induced outward current , AG1478 did not signifi cantly alter the background Cl − current ( Fig . 1 E ) at either + 40 mV ( n = 4 ; P = 0 . 526 ) or − 100 mV ( n = 4 ; P = 0 . 306 ) . AG1478 also prevented activation of Cl − SAC when it was applied intracellularly before integrin stretch . Myo - cytes were pretreated by including 1 μ M AG1478 , a 10 - fold lower concentration , in the pipette solution . After 15 – 20 min of dialysis , myocytes were stretched for 10 min , a time suffi cient to fully activate Cl − SAC ( Browe and Baumgarten , 2003 ) . After pretreatment , stretch elicited a small but statistically insignifi cant current , 0 . 23 ± 0 . 14 pA / pF , at + 40 mV ( n = 5 , P = 0 . 10 ) . This current was only 23 % of that observed without pretreat - ment , 0 . 97 ± 0 . 09 pA / pF ( n = 18 ) . Exogenous EGF Activates Cl − SAC If transactivation of EGFR kinase is an upstream signal - ing event in the activation of Cl − SAC , exogenous EGF , which binds EGFR kinase and stimulates FAK and Src activity and ROS production ( Brunton et al . , 1997 ; Park et al . , 2004 ) , might be expected to mimic the effect of integrin stretch . Fig . 2 illustrates the effect of exoge - nous EGF on Cl − currents in the absence of integrin stretch . Under control conditions , a typical background current was observed ( Fig . 2 , A and E ) . Addition of 3 . 3 nM EGF to bathing solution for 6 min evoked an outwardly rectifying Cl − current that exhibited partial inactivation at positive potentials ( Fig . 2 , B and E ) . The EGF - induced difference current ( Fig . 2 , D and F ) was obtained by digital subtraction . Overall , exogenous EGF ( 5 – 6 min ) increased the outward Cl − current at + 40 mV by 0 . 81 ± 0 . 05 pA / pF ( n = 24 , P < 0 . 001 ) , from 1 . 20 ± 0 . 07 to 2 . 01 ± 0 . 08 pA / pF . As found with stretch , EGF had a very modest effect on the inward Cl − current . At − 100 mV , EGF increased inward current by 0 . 04 ± 0 . 01 pA / pF ( n = 24 ; P < 0 . 001 ) , from − 0 . 24 ± 0 . 02 to − 0 . 28 ± 0 . 03 pA / pF . Signifi cant effects of EGF on inward current were not consistently detected in smaller groups , however . To further characterize the EGF - induced current , we examined its sensitivity to tamoxifen . Tamoxifen inhibits Cl − SAC and I Cl , swell but does not affect either the PKA - regulated CFTR or the Ca 2 + - activated Cl − currents ( Hume et al . , 2000 ; Browe and Baumgarten , 2003 ) . After full activation of Cl − current by 3 . 3 nM EGF , Figure 2 . Exogenous EGF activates Cl − current in the absence of integrin stretch . Currents before ( A , Control ) and after ( B , EGF ) exposure to EGF ( 3 . 3 nM , 6 min ) , and after addition of the Cl − SAC and I Cl , swell blocker tamoxifen ( 10 μ M , 6 min ) in the continued pres - ence of EGF ( C , + Tamoxifen ) . EGF - induced difference current ( D , EGF - Induced ) was obtained by digital subtraction . I - V relationships for A - C ( E ) and for the EGF - induced current ( F ) . Each I - V relation - ship reversed near E Cl . The EGF - induced Cl − current partially inac - tivated at positive potentials , exhibited strong outward rectifi cation , and both the EGF - induced and background Cl − currents were com - pletely blocked by tamoxifen . At + 40 mV , the Cl − current elicited by EGF was 0 . 81 ± 0 . 05 pA / pF ( n = 24 , P < 0 . 001 ) , and tamoxifen reduced the current by 170 ± 8 % ( n = 4 , P < 0 . 001 ) . Browe and Baumgarten 241 exposure to 10 μ M tamoxifen for 6 min in the contin - ued presence of EGF completely abolished the EGF - induced Cl − current as well as a large fraction of the background Cl − current ( Fig . 2 , C and E ) . In these ex - periments , tamoxifen ( 6 – 8 min ) blocked 170 ± 8 % ( n = 4 ; P < 0 . 001 ) and 177 ± 55 % ( n = 4 ; P < 0 . 02 ) of the EGF - induced current at + 40 and − 100 mV , respec - tively . EGF increased the Cl − current at + 40 mV from 1 . 15 ± 0 . 09 to 1 . 85 ± 0 . 06 pA / pF ( n = 4 ; P < 0 . 001 ) , and tamoxifen reduced the current to 0 . 67 ± 0 . 13 pA / pF , a value signifi cantly less than control ( n = 4 ; P < 0 . 01 ) . Fig . 3 compares the time course of Cl − currents at + 40 mV after activation by either EGF ( 3 . 3 nM ) or integ - rin stretch , and as a control for time , the background current in the absence of an intervention . The EGF - induced Cl − current was well described by a single ex - ponential with a time constant of 3 . 2 ± 0 . 9 min ( n = 4 ) , equivalent to a t 1 / 2 of 2 . 2 ± 0 . 6 min , and was 0 . 91 ± 0 . 07 pA / pF at 20 min . Activation by integrin stretch was slower and sigmoidal with a t 1 / 2 of 4 . 3 ± 0 . 6 min ( n = 4 ) , and the steady - state current was 1 . 19 ± 0 . 07 pA / pF . Once activated , both currents remained at stable levels for the remainder of the recording period . In the ab - sence of an intervention , the background current was stable for 20 min . The more rapid activation of Cl − cur - rent by EGF as compared with stretch is consistent with , but does not prove , the idea that EGF is a downstream event in the stretch - induced signaling cascade regulat - ing Cl − SAC . Moreover , these data demonstrate the sta - bility of the current recordings and serve as a time control for studies with blockers . Role of PI - 3K Mechanical stretch , cell swelling , and integrin clustering all activate PI - 3K ( Sadoshima and Izumo , 1997 ; Franchini et al . , 2000 ) . Upon integrin clustering , activation of FAK and Src leads to the recruitment of PI - 3K to costameres ( Franchini et al . , 2000 ) , and PI - 3K regulates NADPH ox - idase activity ( Vignais , 2002 ) . Fig . 4 illustrates a test of the idea that PI - 3K also participates in the activation of Cl − SAC in response to β 1 integrin stretch using wort - mannin , an irreversible blocker of PI - 3K ( Stein and Waterfi eld , 2000 ) . After activating Cl − SAC by β 1 integrin stretch for 6 min ( Fig . 4 , B and D ) , exposure to 500 nM wortmannin for 12 min with continued integrin stretch partially inhibited the outward Cl − SAC ( Fig . 4 , C and D ) . Wortmannin ( 12 – 15 min ) blocked 67 ± 6 % ( n = 7 ; P < 0 . 001 ) of the Cl − SAC at + 40 mV . Stretch increased the Cl − current from 1 . 45 ± 0 . 14 to 2 . 47 ± 0 . 17 pA / pF , and wortmannin reduced the current to 1 . 81 ± 0 . 12 pA / pF ( n = 7 ; P < 0 . 001 ) . Although block of Cl − SAC by wort - mannin at + 40 mV was substantial , the current remained signifi cantly greater than control ( n = 7 ; P = 0 . 006 ) . Surprisingly , wortmannin ( 500 nM , 12 min ) augmented the outward background current in the absence of stretch ( Fig . 4 E ) . At + 40 mV , the Cl − current was in - creased by 15 ± 5 % ( n = 4 ; P = 0 . 02 ) , from 1 . 16 ± 0 . 14 to 1 . 33 ± 0 . 16 pA / pF . The basis for the stimulation of background Cl − current was not investigated further . Figure 3 . Time courses of Cl − currents activated by EGF ( 3 . 3 nM ) and integrin stretch and the background current . Currents at + 40 mV were recorded at 1 - min intervals for 20 min . Stretch - and EGF - induced currents were normalized by their steady - state values , 1 . 19 ± 0 . 07 ( n = 4 ) and 0 . 91 ± 0 . 07 ( n = 4 ) , respectively , and the background current was normalized by the steady - state current after stretch . Cl − current activation by EGF exhibited an exponential time course ( τ = 3 . 2 ± 0 . 9 min ; n = 4 ; equivalent t 1 / 2 = 2 . 2 ± 0 . 6 min ) , while activation by integrin stretch followed a slower , sigmoidal time course ( t 1 / 2 = 4 . 3 ± 0 . 6 min ; n = 4 ) . The background current was nearly constant throughout the recording period in unstimulated myocytes . Solid lines are fi ts to averaged data ; dashed line is zero current . Figure 4 .

( E ) I - V relationships comparing the wortmannin - sensitive current after integrin stretch ( Stretch - Wort ) and the wortmannin - sensitive background current ( Wort - Control ) in different myocytes . At + 40 mV , wortmannin inhibited 67 ± 6 % ( n = 7 ; P < 0 . 001 ) of the Cl − SAC . In contrast , wortman - nin elicited a small increase in background current at + 40 mV , 15 ± 5 % ( n = 4 ; P = 0 . 02 ) , in unstretched myocytes . 242 Signaling Cascade Regulating Cl − SAC To verify the involvement of PI - 3K in the response to integrin stretch , LY294002 was employed . LY294002 is structurally and mechanistically distinct from wortmannin and reversibly inhibits PI - 3K ( Stein and Waterfi eld , 2000 ; Oudit et al . , 2004 ) . Fig . 5 confi rms the sensitivity of Cl − SAC to block of PI - 3K . After activating Cl − SAC by β 1 integrin stretch for 5 min , exposure to LY294002 ( 20 μ M , 15 min ) with continued stretch blocked al - most all of the Cl − SAC ( Fig . 5 , A and B ) . Stretch in - creased the current at + 40 mV from 1 . 14 ± 0 . 28 to 1 . 86 ± 0 . 36 pA / pF ( n = 4 ; P < 0 . 001 ) , and LY294002 ( 20 μ M , 15 min ) reduced the current by 99 ± 11 % ( n = 4 ; P < 0 . 001 ) . The current remaining in the presence of LY294002 , 1 . 20 ± 0 . 35 pA / pF , was not signifi cantly dif - ferent from the control current ( n = 4 ; P = 0 . 54 ) . In contrast to its pronounced inhibition of the stretch - induced current , LY294002 ( 20 μ M , 15 min ) had a negli - gible effect on the background current in the absence of stretch ( Fig . 5 C ) . At + 40 mV , LY294002 reduced background current by only 3 ± 1 % ( n = 4 ; P = 0 . 07 ) , from 0 . 62 ± 0 . 07 to 0 . 60 ± 0 . 08 pA / pF . EGFR kinase also utilizes PI - 3K as one of its principal downstream mediators of signaling ( Bogdan and Klämbt , 2001 ) . Therefore , we tested whether the Cl − current elicited by exogenous EGF ( 3 . 3 nM , 6 min ) also depended on PI - 3K . LY294002 ( 20 μ M , 12 min ) inhib - ited almost all of the EGF - induced current in the con - tinued presence of EGF . Overall , EGF increased the Cl − current at + 40 mV from 0 . 97 ± 0 . 10 to 1 . 66 ± 0 . 09 pA / pF , and LY294002 ( 20 μ M , 12 – 14 min ) blocked 124 ± 16 % ( n = 4 ; P < 0 . 001 ) of the current elicited by EGF . The current remaining after LY294002 , 0 . 82 ± 0 . 14 pA / pF , was not significantly different from the con - trol ( n = 4 ; P = 0 . 15 ) . The inward currents at − 100 mV were small and were not signifi cantly affected in this set of experiments . Thus , block of PI - 3K by LY294002 had the same inhibitory effect on the EGF - and integrin stretch – induced Cl − currents but no effect on the out - wardly rectifying background current . Role of NADPH Oxidase in EGF - induced Cl − Current Previously we provided evidence that activation of Cl − SAC by integrin stretch involves NADPH oxidase and the production of ROS ( Browe and Baumgarten , 2004 ) . EGFR kinase and PI - 3K are known to participate in the activation of NADPH oxidase ( Seshiah et al . , 2002 ) . As illustrated in Fig . 6 , we tested whether the Cl − cur - rent evoked by exogenous EGF also requires NADPH oxidase activity . First , Cl − current was elicited with EGF ( 3 . 3 nM , 5 min ; Fig . 6 , B and D ) , and then gp91ds - tat , a selective membrane - permeant fusion peptide blocker of NADPH oxidase ( Rey et al . , 2001 ) , was added . In the continued presence of EGF , gp91ds - tat ( 500 nM , 15 min ) completely inhibited the EGF - induced Cl − cur - rent ( Fig . 6 , C and D ) . EGF ( 3 . 3 nM , 5 min ) increased outward Cl − current at + 40 mV from 1 . 16 ± 0 . 15 to 2 . 16 ± 0 . 16 pA / pF ( n = 4 ; P < 0 . 001 ) , and gp91ds - tat ( 500 nM , 12 – 15 min ) inhibited 133 ± 20 % ( n = 4 ; P < 0 . 001 ) of the EGF - induced Cl − current . The current after gp91ds - tat treatment , 0 . 94 ± 0 . 07 pA / pF , was not signifi cantly different from the control current ( n = 4 ; P = 0 . 19 ) . EGF also signifi cantly increased the inward Cl − current at − 100 mV from − 0 . 16 ± 0 . 02 to − 0 . 23 ± 0 . 01 pA / pF ( n = 4 ; P < 0 . 01 ) , and gp91ds - tat reduced the current to − 0 . 18 ± 0 . 01 pA / pF , blocking 87 ± 27 % ( n = 4 ; P = 0 . 01 ) . To rule out nonspecifi c effects of gp91ds - tat , experi - ments were conducted with two peptides as negative controls . We used scramb - tat , a membrane - permeant chimeric peptide that does not interfere with the bind - ing of gp91 phox to p47 phox , and gp91ds , which blocks NADPH oxidase in broken cell systems but is imper - meant ( Rey et al . , 2001 ) . As shown in Fig . 7 , Cl − current was elicited with EGF ( 3 . 3 nM , 5 min ) . Then , either scramb - tat ( 500 nM , 15 min ; Fig . 7 A ) or gp91ds Figure 5 .

At + 40 mV , LY294002 inhibited 124 ± 16 % ( n = 4 , P < 0 . 001 ) of the EGF - induced Cl − current . ( D ) I - V relationships comparing the LY294002 - sensitive current after EGF exposure ( EGF - LY ) , and the LY294002 - sensitive background current ( Control - LY ; from B ) . LY294002 did not signifi cantly affect background current ( n = 4 ; P = 0 . 07 ) in the absence of a stimulus . Browe and Baumgarten 243 ( 500 nM , 15 min ; Fig . 7 B ) was applied in the continued presence of EGF . Neither negative control peptide suppressed the EGF - induced current . If anything , the currents elicited by EGF continued to increase slightly over most of the voltage range positive to − 20 mV . In the experiments with scramb - tat , EGF increased Cl − current at + 40 mV from 1 . 09 ± 0 . 22 to 2 . 03 ± 0 . 18 pA / pF ( n = 4 ; P < 0 . 001 ) , and it was 2 . 04 ± 0 . 21 pA / pF after a 12 – 15 min exposure to scramb - tat ( n = 4 ; P = 0 . 94 ) . Thus , the tat sequence was not sufficient to reproduce the effect of gp91ds - tat . Similarly , in experiments with impermeant gp91ds , EGF increased the Cl − current at + 40 mV from 0 . 98 ± 0 . 07 to 1 . 65 ± 0 . 04 pA / pF ( n = 3 ; P = 0 . 001 ) , and it was 1 . 61 ± 0 . 02 pA / pF after a 12 – 15 min exposure to impermeant gp91ds ( n = 3 ; P = 0 . 57 ) . The ineffectiveness of active but impermeant gp91ds indicates that the site blocked by gp91ds - tat must be in the cytoplasm or on the inter - nal face of the sarcolemma and that gp91ds cannot block the EGF - activated Cl − channel from the outside . Cl − SAC Is a Volume - sensitive Current Based on its biophysical and pharmacological charac - teristics , it was hypothesized that the same channel in ventricular myocytes is responsible for both the Cl − SAC evoked by β 1 integrin stretch and the volume - sensitive Cl − current , I Cl , swell ( Browe and Baumgarten , 2003 , 2004 ) . Moreover , both Cl − SAC and I Cl , swell are regulated by several of the same signaling molecules ( Browe and Baumgarten , 2003 , 2004 ; Ren and Baumgar - ten , 2005 ) . If this idea is correct , current elicited by β 1 integrin stretch should be volume sensitive . A test of this prediction is illustrated in Fig . 8 . After recording control currents in isosmotic 1T bath solution ( Fig . 8 , A and E ) , Cl − SAC was activated by a 5 - min integrin stretch in 1T bath solution ( Fig . 8 , B and E ) . Suprafu - sion of 1 . 5T hyperosmotic bath solution for 10 min while integrin stretch was continued completely inhib - ited the stretch - induced Cl − current ( Fig . 8 , C and E ) . Moreover , block of the Cl − SAC by osmotic shrinkage was reversed by returning to 1T bath solution for 5 min while maintaining stretch ( Fig . 8 , D and E ) . Inhibition of the Cl − SAC by osmotic shrinkage was observed in all myocytes studied . Stretch in 1T bath solution increased Cl − current at + 40 mV from 1 . 10 ± 0 . 30 to 2 . 32 ± 0 . 57 pA / pF ( n = 4 ; P = 0 . 001 ) , and osmotic shrinkage in 1 . 5T bath solution ( 10 – 12 min ) blocked 94 ± 6 % ( n = 4 ; P < 0 . 001 ) of stretch - activated current , reducing the current at + 40 mV to 1 . 13 ± 0 . 24 pA / pF , a value not different from control ( n = 4 ; P = 0 . 91 ) . After reintro - duction of 1T bathing solution for 5 min , the current returned to 2 . 33 ± 0 . 51 pA / pF , a value not signifi cantly different from that after the initial period of stretch in 1T bathing solution ( n = 4 ; P = 0 . 95 ) . The effectiveness of 1 . 5T in blocking the Cl − SAC may be overestimated in these experiments because hyper - osmotic bath solution also blocks a tamoxifen - sensitive , outwardly rectifying background Cl − current attributed to partial activation of I Cl , swell under isosmotic conditions ( Hume et al . , 2000 ) . To estimate the contribution of background I Cl , swell to the current blocked by 1 . 5T dur - ing integrin stretch , unstretched myocytes in 1T were Figure 6 . gp91ds - tat , a cell - permeable , chimeric peptide that selectively blocks NADPH oxidase assembly by mimicking the gp91 phox docking sequence for p47 phox , inhibits EGF - induced Cl − current .

At + 40 mV , scramb - tat and gp91ds inhibited the EGF - induced Cl − current by − 2 ± 7 % ( n = 4 , P = ns ) and 7 ± 9 % ( n = 4 , P = ns ) , respectively . 244 Signaling Cascade Regulating Cl − SAC exposed to 1 . 5T for 10 min . At + 40 mV , osmotic shrink - age in1 . 5T reduced the background current by 0 . 53 ± 0 . 09 pA / pF ( n = 4 ; P = 0 . 005 ) , from 1 . 69 ± 0 . 37 to 1 . 15 ± 0 . 29 pA / pF ( Fig . 8 F ) . The current remaining after shrinkage was the same in the absence , 1 . 15 ± 0 . 29 pA / pF , and presence , 1 . 13 ± 0 . 24 pA / pF , of integrin stretch . On the other hand , the initial background cur - rent in the set of cells that were stretched , 1 . 10 ± 0 . 30 pA / pF , was smaller than that in the set that was not stretched , 1 . 69 ± 0 . 37 pA / pF . If the EGF - induced Cl − current is the same as the Cl − SAC and I Cl , swell , it also should be volume sensitive , as is demonstrated in Fig . 9 . The Cl − current in 1T bathing solution ( Fig . 9 , A and E ) was increased by addition of EGF ( 3 . 3 nM , 5 min ; Fig . 9 , B and E ) . The EGF - induced current was blocked after 10 min of myocyte shrinkage by hyperosmotic 1 . 5T solution containing EGF ( Fig . 9 , C and E ) , and block was completely reversed after returning to 1T bath solution containing EGF for 5 min ( Fig . 9 , D and E ) . Fig . 9 F compares the current blocked by 1 . 5T bathing solution before and after exposure to EGF . At + 40 mV , EGF in 1T bathing solution increased the Cl − current from 1 . 65 ± 0 . 19 to 2 . 32 ± 0 . 32 pA / pF ( n = 4 ; P = 0 . 003 ) , and exposure to 1 . 5T bathing solu - tion with EGF blocked 127 ± 11 % ( n = 4 ; P = 0 . 001 ) of the EGF - induced current . The current after myocyte shrinkage , 1 . 46 ± 0 . 14 pA / pF , was not signifi cantly dif - ferent than the control current ( n = 4 ; P = 0 . 22 ) . On returning to 1T bathing solution with EGF , 94 ± 6 % ( n = 4 ; P = 0 . 001 ) of the initial EGF - induced current recovered ; the current recorded under these conditions , 2 . 25 ± 0 . 28 pA / pF , was not signifi cantly different from the initial current with EGF ( n = 4 ; P = 0 . 64 ) .

Browe and Baumgarten 245 Figure 10 . Proposed sim - plifi ed model of signaling coupling integrin stretch to activation of Cl − SAC . Integrin stretch activates FAK , Src , and other signaling pathways , which trigger the release of AngII from secretory vesicles . Binding of AngII and / or stretch initiate AT1 receptor signaling , which participates with FAK and Src in the trans - activation of EGFR kinase and the subsequent down - stream production of PI - 3K . Components of these signal - ing cascades , including PI - 3K and Src , induce activation of p47 phox , p67 phox , and rac , which translocate to the membrane and assemble with gp91 phox and p22 phox to form the active NADPH oxidase complex . NADPH oxidase catalyzes the production of ⋅ O 2− , which is rapidly converted to H 2 O 2 by dismutation . H 2 O 2 may activate Cl − SAC directly or via ROS - sensitive signaling pathways . under isosmotic conditions via the AngII signaling cas - cade and involves AT1 receptors , Src / FAK signaling , and H 2 O 2 generated , at least in part , by NADPH oxidase ( Browe and Baumgarten , 2003 , 2004 ) . The present re - sults indicate that EGFR kinase and PI - 3K , which couple AT1 receptors to NADPH oxidase ( Seshiah et al . , 2002 ) , are also components of the signaling cascade that evokes Cl − SAC in response to integrin stretch . Moreover , stretch - and EGF - induced currents were volume sensi - tive , suggesting that they are carried by the same chan - nels as I Cl , swell . A simple scheme accounting for both our present and previous fi ndings is depicted in Fig . 10 . Activation of Cl − SAC was abrogated by blockers of EGFR kinase , and exogenous EGF elicited a tamoxifen - sensitive cur - rent that mimicked the Cl − SAC but turned on more rapidly . These data suggest that stretch stimulates Cl − SAC via EGFR kinase . PI - 3K must be downstream from EGFR kinase because inhibition of PI - 3K suppressed both the stretch - and EGF - induced current . PI - 3K has been implicated in the translocation of Rac to the mem - brane and the activation of NADPH oxidase ( Seshiah et al . , 2002 ; Vignais , 2002 ) . Consistent with this idea , the EGF - induced Cl − current was blocked by gp91ds - tat , a selective inhibitor of NADPH oxidase , and we previously demonstrated that stretch - induced Cl − cur - rents are blocked by other NADPH oxidase inhibitors , diphenyleneiodonium ( DPI ) and AEBSF ( Browe and Baumgarten , 2004 ) . Two other signaling molecules in this cascade , AngII and H 2 O 2 , also elicit currents that mimic Cl − SAC in the absence of stretch , whereas the AT1 blocker losartan and degradation of H 2 O 2 by cata - lase inhibit Cl − SAC ( Browe and Baumgarten , 2004 ) . The idea that AT1 receptor activation leads to stimu - lation of NADPH oxidase by a cascade that includes EGFR kinase and PI - 3K is well established in other sys - tems ( Seshiah et al . , 2002 ) . Although the simple linear scheme in Fig . 10 is suffi cient to explain our observa - tions on Cl − SAC , we cannot exclude additional interac - tions between these signaling molecules . Stretch - and osmotic swelling – induced Cl − currents share several biophysical and pharmacological character - istics , and it has been suggested that Cl − SAC are carried by the same channels as I Cl , swell ( Browe and Baumgarten , 2003 , 2004 ) . The present fi ndings support this idea . Both the stretch - and EGF - induced currents were suppressed by osmotic shrinkage , and the EGF - induced current was blocked by tamoxifen , as previously shown for Cl − SAC ( Browe and Baumgarten , 2003 ) . Cl − SAC and I Cl , swell also are regulated by some of the same signaling pathways . Block of EGFR kinase inhibits the activation of I Cl , swell by osmotic swelling in human atrial and rabbit ventricular myocytes ( Du et al . , 2004 ; Ren and Baumgarten , 2005 ) , and recently we found that AT1 receptors , PI - 3K , NADPH oxidase , and ROS play the same roles in eliciting I Cl , swell upon osmotic swelling in rabbit ventricle ( Ren et al . , 2005 ) as in re - sponse to integrin stretch . In contrast , block of Src fam - ily protein tyrosine kinases with PP2 gives a result that depends on the stimulus . PP2 suppresses Cl − SAC ( Browe and Baumgarten , 2003 ) , whereas it stimulates I Cl , swell after it has been activated by swelling ( Du et al . , 2004 ; Ren and Baumgarten , 2005 ; Walsh and Zhang , 2005 ) . Walsh and Zhang ( 2005 ) also observed stimula - tion of I Cl , swell in neonatal rat myocytes when FAK was in - hibited by overexpression of FRNK , an endogenous FAK inhibitor . On the other hand , Sorota ( 1995 ) found that nonselective tyrosine kinase inhibitors , which also should have inhibited Src and FAK , pre - vented activation of I Cl , swell in canine atrial myocytes ; the reason for this discrepancy is unknown . It is also un - clear why inhibition of Src and FAK stimulates I Cl , swell in several preparations but inhibited Cl − SAC . Osmotic swelling differentially modulates members of the Src 246 Signaling Cascade Regulating Cl − SAC family ( Cohen , 2005 ) , whereas PP2 broadly inhibits this protein tyrosine kinase family . Osmotic swelling also may give rise to signaling not elicited by stretch . Other signaling pathways are implicated in the regulation of I Cl , swell ( Hume et al . , 2000 ; Baumgarten and Clemo , 2003 ) , but their role in regulation of Cl − SAC has not been tested . Although we termed the stretch - and EGF - induced stimulation of Cl − current an activation , the present studies do not distinguish between de novo opening of channels that are silent in the absence of these stimuli and modulation of I Cl , swell channels that are a major contributor to the background outwardly rectifying Cl − current under isosmotic conditions ( Hume et al . , 2000 ) . Block of EGFR kinase by AG1478 and PI - 3K by LY 294002 restored stretch - and EGF - induced current to their control level but did not alter the background current in the absence of these stimuli . In contrast , the I Cl , swell / Cl − SAC blocker tamoxifen and osmotic shrinkage inhibited both the stretch - and EGF - induced and the background current . These observations may suggest that back - ground I Cl , swell is regulated by signaling processes not studied here , but this requires further verifi cation . Regulation of Cl − SAC by EGFR Kinase Transactivation and EGF The ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases is repre - sented in mammals by EGFR kinase ( ErbB1 ) and ErbB2 – ErbB4 , which form homo - and heterodimers ( Bogdan and Klämbt , 2001 ; Holbro and Hynes , 2004 ) . Two lines of evidence implicate EGFR kinase in Cl − SAC activation . First , 10 μ M AG1478 completely blocked Cl − SAC during stretch , and intracellular pre - treatment with a 10 - fold lower concentration via the patch pipette suppressed Cl − SAC activation by subse - quent stretch . AG1478 is a highly selective blocker that inhibits ATP binding to EGFR kinase with an IC 50 of 3 nM , whereas it is a weak inhibitor of ErbB2 and the platelet - derived growth factor receptor with an IC 50 of > 100 μ M in both cases ( Levitzki and Gazit , 1995 ) . Sec - ond , exogenous EGF activated an outwardly rectifying , tamoxifen - sensitive Cl − current that resembles Cl − SAC in the absence of stretch . EGF specifi cally binds to EGFR kinase ; ErbB3 and ErbB4 bind neuregulins , and no ligand is known for ErbB2 ( Bogdan and Klämbt , 2001 ; Holbro and Hynes , 2004 ) . While these results clearly implicate EGFR kinase in Cl − SAC activation , we cannot rule out the possibility that other ErbB family members participate in signaling by forming heterodi - mers with EGFR kinase . This appears to be the fi rst evidence that EGFR kinase mediates integrin signaling in cardiac myocytes . Several mechanisms for EGFR kinase transactivation have been identifi ed . Integrins and EGFR colocalize and physically interact within macromolecular complexes at the cell membrane in human ECV304 cells and mouse fi bro - blasts , and integrin engagement transactivates EGFR kinase in the absence of serum or exogenous growth factors ( Moro et al . , 2002 ; Cabodi et al . , 2004 ) . This de - pends on the integrin cytoplasmic tail , the adaptor pro - tein p130Cas , and Src , which phosphorylates EGFR kinase at tyr - 845 and triggers autophosphorylation and downstream signaling . In addition , mechanical stretch and AT1 receptors transactivate EGFR kinase by a mech - anism that depends on Src and H 2 O 2 in a variety of cells ( Ushio - Fukai et al . , 2001 ; Oeckler et al . , 2003 ; Kippen - berger et al . , 2005 ) , and the carboxyl tail of AT1 recep - tors directly interacts with and transactivates EGFR kinase after phosphorylation of AT1 Y319 ( Seta and Sadoshima , 2003 ) . Thus , it is possible that integrin - mediated stretch directly activates EGFR kinase , or a factor directly linked to EGFR kinase activation , in a process that is independent of ligands for this receptor kinase . In this vein , it recently was reported that the AT1 receptor can be activated by stretch by a mecha - nism independent of AngII binding ( Zou et al . , 2004 ) . An autocrine – paracrine mechanism for transactiva - tion of EGFR kinase also is well established in the car - diovascular system ( Eguchi et al . , 2003 ; Shah and Catt , 2004 ) . AT1 receptor activation stimulates Zn 2 + - depen - dent matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) that cleave membrane - tethered pro - heparin – binding EGF - like growth factor ( proHB - EGF ) . This causes shedding of soluble heparin - binding EGF ( HB - EGF ) , which is a li - gand for EGF kinase . Moreover , integrins bind to and can activate MMP directly ( Stanton et al . , 1998 ) and co - localize with proHB - EGF and EGFR kinase at the sur - face membrane ( Nakamura et al . , 1995 ; Moro et al . , 2002 ; Cabodi et al . , 2004 ) . Shedding of HB - EGF may explain why the Cl − current elicited by stretch was about the same magnitude as that activated by exogenous EGF when only a small fraction of the integrins were stretched by magnetic beads . A large number of myocytes with at - tached beads covered the chamber fl oor and all were stretched simultaneously . Therefore , the cell under study was exposed to locally released HB - EGF and also to HB - EGF delivered by diffusion and solution fl ow from other myocytes . Nevertheless , the relative impor - tance of the various mechanisms for transactivation of EGFR kinase is unknown . Identity of the EGF - induced Cl − Current The primary Cl − currents traditionally recognized in cardiac myocytes include the PKA - dependent Cl − cur - rent due to the cystic fi brosis transmembrane conduc - tance regulator ( I CFTR , cardiac ) , the calcium - dependent transient outward Cl − current ( I Cl , Ca ) , and I Cl , swell ( Hume et al . , 2000 ) . The biophysical and pharmacological profi le and volume sensitivity of the EGF - induced Cl − current are consistent with I Cl , swell rather than either I CFTR , cardiac or I Cl , Ca . The EGF - induced Cl − current and I Cl , swell both activate over several minutes , outwardly rectify , and partially inactivate at positive potentials . Browe and Baumgarten 247 In contrast , I CFTR , cardiac is time independent at all volt - ages under similar conditions ( Hume et al . , 2000 ) . I Cl , Ca is activated by cytoplasmic Ca 2 + transients . With normal Ca 2 + handling , I Cl , Ca displays outward rectifi cation and inactivates at positive potentials ( Zygmunt and Gibbons , 1991 ) . If cytoplasmic Ca 2 + is clamped at an elevated level , however , I Cl , Ca is time independent . Under the present conditions , I Cl , Ca should be negligible because the bathing solution was Ca 2 + free , and Ca 2 + transients were minimized by clamping the cytoplasmic free Ca 2 + to (cid:9) 35 nM with 8 mM EGTA . In addition , the EGF - induced Cl − current was blocked by 10 μ M tamoxifen as expected for I Cl , swell ( Vandenberg et al . , 1994 ) , but I CFTR , cardiac ( Vandenberg et al . , 1994 ) and I Cl , Ca ( Valverde et al . , 1993 ) are insensitive to tamoxifen . Finally , both EGF - induced Cl − current and Cl − SAC were inhibited by myocyte shrinkage with 1 . 5T hyperosmotic bathing solution . Volume sensitivity is a fundamental character - istic of I Cl , swell that distinguishes it from I CFTR , cardiac and I Cl , Ca ( Hume et al . , 2000 ) . Thus the characteristics of the EGF - induced Cl − current resemble I Cl , swell . We note , however , that the inward currents observed here are smaller than typical for I Cl , swell . EGF elicits larger inward Cl − currents under different recoding conditions ( un - published data ) . EGFR kinase previously was shown to modulate I Cl , swell in human atrial ( Du et al . , 2004 ) , rabbit ventricular ( Ren and Baumgarten , 2005 ) , and cultured neonatal rat ven - tricular ( Walsh and Zhang , 2005 ) myocytes under differ - ent experimental conditions . Moreover , exogenous EGF potentiates I Cl , swell in liver HTC ( Varela et al . , 2004 ) and mouse mammary C127 cells ( Abdullaev et al . , 2003 ) , as well as hypotonicity - induced 125 I − fl ux in human intes - tine 407 cells ( Tilly et al . , 1993 ) . In the latter two studies , EGF did not activate anion current under isosmotic con - ditions , however . EGF also up - regulated I Cl , swell in LNCaP epithelial cells , but this was attributed to enhanced ex - pression of ClC - 3 ( Lemonnier et al . , 2004 ) . Regulation of Cl − SAC by PI - 3K Block of integrin stretch - and EGF - induced currents by wortmannin and LY 294002 argues for the participa - tion of PI - 3K in the response to both stimuli . Because inhibition of PI - 3K suppressed the EGF - induced cur - rent , these data also require that PI - 3K is downstream from EGFR kinase in the signaling cascade ( see Fig . 10 ) , as documented by biochemical methods ( Bogdan and Klämbt , 2001 ) . Osmotic activation of I Cl , swell was shown to involve PI - 3K in rabbit ventricular myocytes ( Ren et al . , 2005 ) , smooth muscle ( Wang et al . , 2004 ) , and epithelial cells ( Shi et al . , 2002 ) Moreover , mechanical stretch ( Petroff et al . , 2001 ) , os - motic swelling ( Bewick et al . , 1999 ) , integrin activation ( Franchini et al . , 2000 ) , AngII ( Rabkin et al . , 1997 ) , and EGFR kinase ( Krieg et al . , 2004 ) all stimulate PI - 3K in cardiac myocytes . Cardiac myocytes predominantly express class I PI - 3K heterodimers ; p110 α - p85 is activated by RTK , and p110 γ - p101 is activated by the βγ subunits of G proteins ( Prasad et al . , 2003 ; Oudit et al . , 2004 ) . Wortmannin covalently modifi es the p110 catalytic subunit , whereas LY294002 is structurally distinct and competes with ATP for the p110 active site ( Stein and Waterfi eld , 2000 ; Oudit et al . , 2004 ) . The observation that 500 nM wort - mannin suppressed only 67 % of Cl − SAC may provide a clue as to which PI - 3K isoform is involved . Wortmannin inhibits most PI - 3K isoforms with an IC 50 of 1 – 10 nM , but monomeric class II PI - 3K - C2 α , which also is ex - pressed in heart , is relatively insensitive to wortmannin with an IC 50 of (cid:9) 400 nM ( Stein and Waterfi eld , 2000 ; Oudit et al . , 2004 ) . The relative insensitivity of the PI - 3K - C2 α isoform may explain why wortmannin only par - tially inhibited Cl − SAC . Consistent with this idea , engagement of integrins activates PI - 3K C2 α in both platelets ( Zhang et al . , 1998 ) and smooth muscle cells ( Paulhe et al . , 2002 ) . On the other hand , wortmannin , but not LY 294002 , augmented the background current in the absence of stretch . The basis for this is unknown , but a stimulation of a background component of cur - rent in the presence of stretch would appear as incom - plete block of the stretch - induced current . It also must be recognized that neither wortmannin nor LY 294002 is perfectly selective for PI - 3K . Wortmannin inhibits my - osin light chain kinase , and LY 294002 blocks casein ki - nase - 2 , several K + channels ( Stein and Waterfi eld , 2000 ; Oudit et al . , 2004 ) , and L - type Ca 2 + channels ( Welling et al . , 2005 ) . Because their nonspecifi c actions differ , however , it seems likely that both antagonists are work - ing here by suppressing the PI - 3K pathway . Although there is no evidence to suggest that both wortmannin and LY 294002 block anion channels , we also cannot defi nitively rule out this possibility . Regulation of the EGF - induced Cl − Current by NADPH Oxidase We previously demonstrated that integrin stretch and AngII elicit Cl − SAC in ventricular myocytes by activat - ing NADPH oxidase and triggering the production of H 2 O 2 ( Browe and Baumgarten , 2004 ) . The present re - sults indicate that the EGF - induced current also de - pends on NADPH oxidase . A membrane - permeant fusion peptide inhibitor of NADPH oxidase assembly , gp91ds - tat , that mimics the docking site on gp91 phox for p47 phox ( Rey et al . , 2001 ) completely blocked Cl − SAC activation by EGF . In contrast , neither the inactive mem - brane - permeant fusion peptide scramb - tat nor the ac - tive but impermeant gp91ds docking sequence 9 - mer altered the EGF - induced current . These results are con - sistent with the expected intracellular site of action of the docking sequence and rule out nonspecifi c effects of the tat 9 - mer and block of Cl − channels by gp91ds from the outside . Two recent reports also conclude that exogenous EGF and / or swelling activate I Cl , swell via 248 Signaling Cascade Regulating Cl − SAC NADPH oxidase in HeLa and liver HTC cells based on block of current by DPI ( Shimizu et al . , 2004 ; Varela et al . , 2004 ) and expression of the dominant negative p47 phox mutant p47 S379A ( Varela et al . , 2004 ) . An advantage of gp91ds - tat relative to more commonly used NADPH oxidase inhibitors is its specifi city , which arises from peptide – peptide interactions . This peptide does not affect the activity of other fl avocytochrome en - zymes or act as an O 2 − scavenger ( Rey et al . , 2001 ) . In contrast , DPI , one of the most widely used inhibitors of NADPH oxidase activity , blocks other fl avin - containing enzymes , including xanthine oxidase ( Dous siere and Vignais , 1992 ) , mitochondrial complex I ( Majander et al . , 1994 ) , and nitric oxide synthase ( Stuehr et al . , 1991 ) . Although gp91ds - tat is specifi c for NADPH oxidase , it apparently does not distinguish between isoforms because the docking sites for p47 phox are homologous ( Rey et al . , 2001 ) . Cardiac myocytes express both the phagocyte - like gp91 phox ( Nox2 ) isoform ( Li et al . , 2002 ; Xiao et al . , 2002 ; Heymes et al . , 2003 ) and the Nox4 homologue ( Byrne et al . , 2003 ) . We also cannot rule out the possibility that other sources of ROS are acti - vated by stretch or EGF and participate in the regula - tion of Cl − SAC . In preliminary experiments , we found that acetylcholine elicits a tamoxifen - sensitive Cl − current that is blocked by 5 - hydroxydecanoate , impli - cating mitochondrial K ATP channels or succinate de - hydrogenase ( Browe and Baumgarten , 2005a ) , and by rotenone , an inhibitor of mitochondrial complex I ( un - published data ) . EGFR kinase and PI - 3K participate in the activation of NADPH oxidase and the generation of ROS in response to diverse stimuli in several tissues . Examples include AngII - and prostaglandin F 2 α receptor – induced hyper - trophy of vascular smooth muscle cells ( Seshiah et al . , 2002 ; Fan et al . , 2005 ) , pressure - induced ROS produc - tion in mouse aortic rings ( Jung et al . , 2004 ) , and exog - enous EGF - induced ROS production in Caco - 2 and HEK293T cells ( Park et al . , 2004 ) . Other growth fac - tors , such as PDGF ( Marumo et al . , 1997 ) and insulin ( Ceolotto et al . , 2004 ) , also stimulate NADPH oxidase in nonphagocytic cells by PI - 3K signaling . Furthermore , β 2 integrin and CD40 engagement elicit NADPH oxi - dase in leukocytes by a process that requires PI - 3K activ - ity ( Yamamori et al . , 2000 ; Ha and Lee , 2004 ) . PI - 3K regulates NADPH oxidase assembly and activa - tion by several mechanisms . First , PI - 3K leads to phos - phorylation of the p47 phox subunit , possibly by stimulation of Akt / PKB ( Hoyal et al . , 2003 ) or PKC ( Yamamori et al . , 2000 ) . Second , PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 and PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 , the products of PI - 3K , bind to PX domains in p47 phox and p40 phox ( Kanai et al . , 2001 ; Zhan et al . , 2002 ) , direct - ing these subunits to the plasma membrane . Third , PI - 3K stimulates Rac , which also is required for NADPH oxidase assembly ( Vignais , 2002 ) . PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 and PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 bind and activate guanine nucleotide exchange factors for Rac and , thereby , trigger Rac acti - vation via GDP – GTP exchange ( Park et al . , 2004 ) . Finally , H 2 O 2 generated by NADPH oxidase feeds for - ward to potentiate RTK - PI - 3K signaling by inhibiting protein tyrosine phosphatases ( Knebel et al . , 1996 ; Bae et al . , 1997 ) and the lipid phosphatase PTEN ( Rhee et al . , 2003 ) , which dephosphorylate the targets of RTK and PI - 3K , respectively . H 2 O 2 also feeds forward by trig - gering HB - EGF – ( Frank and Eguchi , 2003 ) and Src - induced ( Chen et al . , 2001 ; Sato et al . , 2003 ) EGFR kinase phosphorylation . These actions of H 2 O 2 may in part explain its activation of Cl − SAC in the absence of stretch ( Browe and Baumgarten , 2004 ) . Cl − SAC Regulation and Cardiac Pathophysiology HB - EGF , EGFR kinase , PI - 3K , NADPH oxidase , and I Cl , swell are concurrently up - regulated in chronic cardiac disease . Exogenous EGF induces hypertrophic responses in ventricular myocytes ( Rebsamen et al . , 2000 ) . HB - EGF is up - regulated in the peri - infarct region after myo - cardial infarction ( Iwabu et al . , 2002 ) , and enhanced expression and activation of HB - EGF and EGFR kinase are key elements of pressure overload – and G protein coupled receptor – induced cardiac hypertrophy ( Shah and Catt , 2004 ; Smith et al . , 2004 ) . The G βγ - regulated p110 γ isoform of PI - 3K is implicated in maladaptive cardiac hypertrophy triggered by both pressure over - load and G protein – coupled receptors , and knockout of p110 γ prevents heart failure induced by β - adren - ergic agonists ( Prasad et al . , 2003 ; Oudit et al . , 2004 ) . A DPI - sensitive increase in ⋅ O 2 − production by myocytes accompanies the development of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure and is due to increased expression and / or membrane translocation of NADPH oxidase subunits ( Li et al . , 2002 ; Heymes et al . , 2003 ) . Consis - tent with the concurrent up - regulation of its regulatory factors , cardiac Cl − current identifi ed as I Cl , swell is persis - tently active under isosmotic conditions in cardiac my - ocytes isolated from rat , rabbit , and canine models of hypertrophy and heart failure and from the peri - infarct zone 30 d after myocardial infarction ( Bénitah et al . , 1997 ; Clemo et al . , 1999 ; Baumgarten and Clemo , 2003 ; c . f . , van Borren et al . , 2002 ) . Nevertheless , other signal - ing molecules also may be involved in the regulation of I Cl , swell in cardiac disease . Limitations Two limitations of this study should be noted . First , signaling pathways were identifi ed with various ag - onists and antagonists . Although these agents have been well characterized in the literature , the possibil - ity that nonspecifi c effects confound our interpreta - tion should be considered . Second , experiments were conducted at a subphysiologic temperature . This may have had a quantitative or even a qualitative impact on the observations . Browe and Baumgarten 249 In summary , β 1 integrin stretch elicited Cl − SAC in ventricular myocytes by transactivation of EGFR kinase and downstream stimulation of PI - 3K and NADPH oxidase . Exogenous EGF activated tamoxifen - sensitive Cl − SAC in the absence of stretch by a process that also involved PI - 3K and NADPH oxidase . Furthermore , Cl − SAC was volume sensitive and was suppressed by os - motic shrinkage in the presence of stretch or EGF . Thus , it is likely that the Cl − SAC is mediated by the same channel as I Cl , swell . We thank Steven E . Hutchens for technical assistance .
