However , the 23 relationships between the localizations between different proteins had not been analyzed 24 by artificial intelligence . In this study , we applied the generative adversarial network 25 ( GAN ) to generate the protein localizations each other , in which the generation was 26 dependent on the types of cells and the relationships between the proteins . Lamellipodia 27 are one of the actin - dependent subcellular structures involved in cell migration and are 28 mainly generated by the Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) - family verprolin 29 homologous protein 2 ( WAVE2 ) and the membrane remodeling I - BAR domain protein 30 IRSp53 . Focal adhesions are another actin - based structure that contains vinculin protein 31 and are essential for cell migration . In contrast , microtubules are not thought to be 32 directly related to actin filaments . The GAN was trained using images of actin filaments 33 paired with WAVE2 , vinculin , IRSp53 , and microtubules . Then , the generated images 34 of WAVE2 , vinculin , and IRSp53 by the GAN showed high similarity to the real 35 images of WAVE2 , vinculin , and IRSp53 , respectively . However , the microtubule 36 images generated from actin filament images were inferior , corroborating that the 37 microscopic images of actin filaments provide more information about actin - related 38 protein localization . Collectively , this study suggests that the image translation by the 39 GAN can predict the localization of functionally related proteins . 40 3 Introduction 41 Machine learning has achieved significant success in various fields ( Moen et 42 al . , 2019 ) . Machine learning has been applied for classifying cellular images ( Brent and 43 Boucheron , 2018 ; Camacho et al . , 2018 ; Moen et al . , 2019 ) . Using bright - field cell 44 images , radiation - resistant cells were distinguished from the parental cells by machine 45 learning ( Toratani et al . , 2018 ) . Breast cancer cells treated with the anti - cancer agent 46 paclitaxel were also distinguished from the non - treated ones by machine learning 47 ( Kobayashi et al . , 2017 ) . Furthermore , the direction of cell migration was predicted 48 from sequences of cell images ( Nishimoto et al . , 2019 ) . These results demonstrate that 49 machine learning can extract information associated with cellular properties from 50 images . 51 Machine learning has been applied not only in the classifications mentioned 52 above , but also in protein localization . For example , a method known as in silico 53 labeling reportedly generated a putative stained image of a specific marker protein from 54 bright - field cell images to identify the nuclei , neural cells , and live cells ( Christiansen et 55 al . , 2018 ) . The automatic segmentation of intracellular organelles such as the Golgi 56 apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum from bright - field cell images was also achieved 57 ( Pärnamaa and Parts , 2017 ) . However , the translation of the localization of one 58 molecule to another has not been reported . 59 The generative adversarial network ( GAN ) is one of the methods in image 60 analysis by machine learning , where the probability distribution model obtained through 61 training with a number of paired images generates hypothetical paired images 62 ( Goodfellow et al . , 2014 ) . Here , the GAN can generate a similar image of A from an 63 image of B , after learning many paired images of A and B . For example , the GAN can 64 reportedly generate an image of a “smiling” face from an image with a “non - smiling” 65 face , by learning a lot of paired images of non - smiling and smiling faces ( Sagawa and 66 Hagiwara , 2018 ) . The GAN comprises two components : a generator and a 67 discriminator , and thus can generate high - quality images by the competition between 68 the generator and the discriminator . Pix2pix is one of the major implementations of the 69 GAN in image - to - image translation problems ( Isola et al . , 2017 ) . Pix2pix successfully 70 generated many kinds of paired images , including a map from an aerial image , a color 71 4 image from a black - and - white image , a label to a street scene , a biomedical image like 72 that of an MRI to the labels of the organs , and so on . 73 In cell biology , Pix2pix has been applied for labeling cellular membranes and 74 nuclei , using images of these markers ( Tsuda and Hotta , 2019 ) . In this case , the label 75 generation was performed by training with the image pairs of the labels in the regions of 76 the membrane and nucleus ( the label images ) and the actual images . However , almost 77 no report has demonstrated the application of pix2pix to the generation of an image 78 showing the cellular molecule localization at subcellular resolutions , i . e . , the generation 79 of images showing the localization of a protein from those of other proteins . We 80 hypothesized that pix2pix could be used to generate , i . e . , to predict , the protein 81 localization . 82 Cells change their shapes based on the mitotic cycle , surrounding environment , 83 and various other situations by altering the cytoskeleton , including actin filaments 84 ( Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ; Gunning et al . , 2015 ) . In cells , actin filaments further 85 assemble into higher - order configurations , which are primarily determined by Rho - 86 family small GTPases , including Cdc42 , RhoA , and Rac1 ( Hall , 1998 ; Takai et al . , 87 2001 ) . Among them , Rac1 induces actin filament branching through WAVE2 ( Bear et 88 al . , 1998 ; Machesky and Insall , 1998 ; Miki et al . , 1998 ; Suetsugu et al . , 1999b ; Suetsugu 89 et al . , 2003 ) . The activation of Rac1 induces conformational changes of WAVE2 in the 90 regulatory complex , consisting of Sra1 / PIR121 , WAVE2 , Nap1 , Abi1 / 2 , and 91 HSPC300 / BRICK , leading to the activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex within the branched 92 actin filaments ( Innocenti et al . , 2004 ; Suetsugu et al . , 2006 ; Ismail et al . , 2009 ; Chen et 93 al . , 2010 ) ( Figure 1A ) . IRSp53 is also involved in this lamellipodia formation , through 94 WAVE2 ( Miki et al . , 2000 ; Suetsugu et al . , 2006 ) . Vinculin is a protein at focal 95 adhesions , which are connected to actin filaments and are essential for lamellipodia 96 formation ( Ziegler et al . , 2006 ) . Lamellipodia are regarded as one of the essential 97 structures for cell migration , including cancer cell invasion and metastasis ( Takenawa 98 and Suetsugu , 2007 ; Ridley , 2011 ) . In this study , we successfully translated the images 99 of actin filaments of cells to those of WAVE2 , IRSp53 , and vinculin , suggesting that the 100 image translation by the GAN can generate the images of functionally related proteins . 101 102 5 Results 103 Prediction of WAVE2 localization from images of actin filaments by conditional 104 GANs 105 We used Swiss 3T3 cells because they form lamellipodia upon the activation of 106 Rac1 ( Ridley et al . , 1992 ) . We introduced a constitutively active Rac1 mutant into 107 Swiss 3T3 cells to induce lamellipodia . After chemical fixation , the cells were stained 108 with phalloidin and an anti - WAVE2 antibody to visualize actin filaments and WAVE2 , 109 respectively . The fan - shaped actin filament substructures at the cell periphery , which 110 were assumed to be lamellipodia , had WAVE2 ( Figure 1B and C ) . 111 Pairs of images of actin filaments and WAVE2 were taken and used for the 112 training of the pix2pix conditional GAN model . The detailed methodology is described 113 in the Conditional GAN subsection of the Material and Method section ( Hiasa et al . , 114 2019 ) . The translation performance was estimated by four - fold cross - validation , with 115 772 paired images of actin filaments and WAVE2 . In each subset , the training set 116 comprised 579 images , of which 15 % were used as the validation set . No augmentation 117 was performed for the images of Swiss 3T3 cells . The remaining 193 images were used 118 for the testing set . The number of iterations , which corresponds to the epoch number for 119 the training , was 200 , 000 . This process was repeated four times . As the number of 120 iterations grew , the similarity between the generated and actual WAVE2 images 121 increased ( Figure 1D ) . The generated WAVE2 final images were similar to those 122 obtained by antibody staining . 123 Examples of the generated WAVE2 images are presented in Figure 2 . WAVE2 124 showed the prominent localization to lamellipodia . WAVE2 localization was generated 125 clearly at the edge of the cells ( Figure 2A - C ) . The pix2pix model predicted the 126 localization of WAVE2 regardless of the size of the lamellipodia ( Figure 2A - C ) . 127 WAVE2 is not only localized at lamellipodia , but also at other subcellular structures of 128 actin filaments . The tips of microspikes or filopodia in the lamellipodia are known to 129 have a WAVE2 distribution ( Figure 2A ) ( Nakagawa et al . , 2003 ; Nozumi et al . , 2003 ) . 130 The pix2pix model could predict the WAVE2 localization at the microspike structures 131 in lamellipodia , as indicated by the dashed square in Figure 2A . Interestingly , the 132 microspikes outside of the lamellipodia were also predicted to have WAVE2 , as 133 indicated by the square in Figure 2A , and indeed had real WAVE2 . WAVE2 also 134 6 reportedly functions at the cell - cell junctions ( Yamazaki et al . , 2007 ; Nishimura et al . , 135 2016 ) . The two cells were in contact with each other , with the WAVE2 localization at 136 the contact sites ( Figure 2D ) . WAVE2 localization was generated clearly between the 137 cell - cell contacts ( Figure 2D ) . The overall predicted WAVE2 localization by pix2pix 138 appeared to be quite similar to the real WAVE2 localization detected by antibody 139 staining . Together , these facts suggest that pix2pix can predict the localization of 140 WAVE2 not only in the lamellipodia but also in other cellular structures . 141 142 Performance of the prediction of WAVE2 localization 143 We evaluated the prediction accuracy in each pixel . The absolute error in 144 Figure 2A - D is the difference between the generated and true WAVE2 in each pixel , 145 which at lamellipodia was higher than that at the background ( Figure 2A - D ) . 146 Another estimation of the accuracy is based on the robustness of the prediction . 147 The uncertainty in this translation had been difficult to describe . However , the 148 uncertainty of such labeling was successfully demonstrated using Bayesian 149 convolutional neural networks ( Bayesian CNNs ) , based on the U - net architecture 150 combined with the Monte - Carlo dropout of the network layers ( Hiasa et al . , 2019 ) . The 151 dropout ( removal ) of the network layers resulted in different outputs ; however , the high 152 probability output contains less dependency on the alteration of the network layers , 153 resulting in less uncertainty in the output . The uncertainty in predictions of WAVE2 154 localization was also high at the lamellipodia ( Figure 2A - D ) . 155 The absolute error and the uncertainty of the prediction were typically higher at 156 the pixels of WAVE2 localization , indicating that the intensity of WAVE2 localization 157 is not predicted in the absolute values at a pixel resolution ; instead , the prediction is 158 more qualitative , reflecting the context of actin filaments for WAVE2 localization . 159 Therefore , the absolute error would be caused by the aleatoric uncertainty from the 160 randomness of the measurements , rather than the epistemic uncertainty of the 161 prediction . 162 The overall image prediction was then estimated by the mean absolute error 163 ( MAE ) and the structural similarity index measurement ( SSIM ) between the generated 164 and true WAVE2 images . MAE is the mean absolute difference in the pixel values , 165 which is related to the absolute errors in each image . Therefore , a smaller MAE 166 7 indicates a higher similarity between the two images . SSIM is based on the variance in 167 the pixel values . Therefore , higher SSIM indicates more similarity in the perceived 168 quality . The MAE between the generated and true images was lower , and the SSIM 169 between the generated and true images was higher , than those between the true actin 170 filament ( input ) and true WAVE2 images , suggesting that the generator successfully 171 produced WAVE2 images that were better representations than the input actin filament 172 images ( Figure 2E and F ) . 173 Subsequently , we analyzed the performance of WAVE2 localization prediction 174 at the subcellular level . The SSIM was calculated for each 11 × 11 pixel window to 175 generate the SSIM map , and the representative analysis corresponding to Figure 2C is 176 shown in Figure 2G . Then , the images of the ground truth were manually annotated 177 using Labelme ( Russell et al . , 2008 ) ( Figure 2G ) , which enclosed parts of the image 178 with polygons and saved the region information in the JSON file format . The SSIM of 179 the manually annotated lamellipodia and cell - cell adhesions , where WAVE2 was 180 localized , were compared with the SSIM in the other cellular regions . The average 181 SSIMs of lamellipodia and cell – cell adhesion sites were higher than the average SSIMs 182 in the non - lamellipodia regions ( Figure 2H ) . This shows the possibility of using GAN in 183 quantifying the lamellipodia formation . 184 185 Application to the lifeact staining of actin filaments and IRSp53 186 To examine the generalization of this method , we trained the pix2pix model 187 using glioma U251 cells and another regulator of WAVE2 , IRSp53 ( Miki et al . , 188 2000 ; Suetsugu et al . , 2006 ) . The IRSp53 - knockout U251 cells were prepared , and the 189 IRSp53 expression was restored by the stable expression of GFP - IRSp53 . The cells 190 were then further stably labeled by lifeact tagged with mCherry ( lifeact - mCherry ) to 191 visualize actin filaments ( Riedl et al . , 2008 ) . These U251 cells were cultured in serum 192 and fixed for observations of the lamellipodia without the forced activation of Rac1 . 193 The WAVE2 localization was identified by the antibody staining . The images of the 194 actin filaments by lifeact , IRSp53 by GFP , and WAVE2 by the antibody staining were 195 subjected to the machine learning for image translation using pix2pix . We attempted to 196 translate the images of actin filaments ( lifeact ) to WAVE2 , actin filaments to IRSp53 , 197 and IRSp53 to WAVE2 . The translation performance was estimated by four - fold cross - 198 8 validation . In total , 100 images were obtained , and 75 were subjected to the training . 199 The 75 images were augmented 7 - fold by rotations at 90 - degree steps and vertical and 200 horizontal flipping , resulting in the training data set composed of 525 images , of which 201 15 % were used as the validation set . The remaining 25 images were used for the testing 202 set . The results showed that a lifeact image could produce the images of WAVE2 and 203 IRSp53 ( Figure 3A , B ) . Furthermore , pix2pix translated the IRSp53 images to the 204 WAVE2 images ( Figure 3C ) . The prediction at lamellipodia was regarded as having 205 good quality , because the MAE values between the truth and generated images were 206 lower than the MAE values between the input and truth images ( Figure 3D ) . However , 207 some features were not predicted , such as the staining around the nucleus ( Figure 3A - 208 B ) . The failure in the prediction of nuclear localization appears to reduce the quality in 209 perception , because the SSIM values between the input and truth images were similar to 210 those between the truth and generated images ( Figure 3E ) . 211 We observed the lifeact - mCherry in live cells to identify the lamellipodia at the 212 leading edge ( Figure 3F ) . The cells were then fixed , permeabilized , and stained for the 213 WAVE2 localization . The permeabilization slightly altered the lifeact images , because 214 the free lifeact in the cytosol was probably removed by permeabilization . The active 215 lamellipodia region was stained with WAVE2 , and the actin filament images for these 216 lamellipodia were able to generate the WAVE2 image by using the trained model as 217 above ( Figure 3G ) . From these results , we conclude that pix2pix can specifically predict 218 WAVE2 localization at the leading edge of lamellipodia under different conditions . 219 220 Application to vinculin and tubulin localization 221 To examine whether GAN can be applicable to other molecules that are related 222 to lamellipodia , we trained the model between actin filaments and vinculin staining . The 223 translation performance of the model , trained by 100 - paired actin filaments and vinculin 224 images of U251 cells , was estimated by four - fold cross - validation . The 75 images were 225 augmented 7 - fold , resulting in the training data set composed of 525 images , of which 226 15 % were used as the validation set . The remaining 25 images were used for the testing 227 set . The pix2pix succeeded in generating vinculin images from actin - filament images 228 ( Figure 4A ) . The prediction of vinculin was regarded as having good quality , as judged 229 9 by the MAE and the SSIM values ( Figure 4B , C ) , as well as by the recognition by 230 human eyes . 231 232 Application to tubulin localization 233 To examine whether GAN can be applicable to other molecules that are not 234 strongly related to actin filaments , we trained the model between actin filaments and 235 tubulin staining of U251 cells as for the vinculin analysis . The pix2pix model generated 236 a tubulin - like image from actin - filament images ( Figure 5 ) . However , the generated 237 image did not reflect the feature of radial - like tubulin distribution ( Figure 5 ) . From 238 these results , we conclude that the accuracy of pix2pix is decreased if the two molecules 239 lack a strong correlation . 240 241 10 Discussion 242 In this study , we identified subcellular structures using a machine learning 243 method , pix2pix - mediated image translation . Pix2pix is a GAN implementation , and 244 WAVE2 , IRSp53 , and vinculin are established regulators of lamellipodia . Therefore , 245 the prediction of these localizations by image translation is suggested to annotate 246 lamellipodia among actin cytoskeletal structures . The experts in the field will easily 247 distinguish lamellipodial actin filaments from non - lamellipodial ones , but sometimes 248 lamellipodia are not obvious to the untrained eye . The judgment criteria for microscopic 249 images will differ between researchers in different labs . At the very least , the GAN 250 method will reproduce comparable results if the image qualities are similar . 251 Furthermore , this method can be used to label lamellipodia in live cells to quantify the 252 degree of lamellipodia formation , if computation speed increases in the future . 253 The prediction of WAVE2 localization was independent of the size of 254 lamellipodia ( Figure 2 ) . The kernel size of the algorithm , which uses the 4 - pixel 255 window , is equivalent to ~ 1 . 9 μm 2 . Therefore , the continuous features above this size 256 are expected to be difficult to be predicted . However , the features of actin filaments at 257 lamellipodia are thought to be within this window , and thus various sizes of 258 lamellipodia could be annotated by the predicted WAVE2 localization . The vinculin and 259 IRSp53 localizations are also thought to be predictable with such features of actin 260 filaments in 4 - pixel window . 261 We tried to predict the microtubule localization from actin filament 262 localization ; however , this predicted localization was not filamentous . These non - 263 continuous filaments might arise from the kernel size . Alternatively , microtubules are 264 not directly linked to actin filaments , in contrast to the regulators of actin filaments like 265 WAVE2 , IRSp53 , and vinculin , resulting in the inaccurate prediction . In this respect , 266 the GAN might be able to determine / predict the hierarchy of various proteins for 267 specific cellular structures . 268 If the difference between the experimental and predicted images resulted from 269 the mutually independent localization and function , then the GAN might be used as a 270 tool to discover a localization and a function that can be independent of each other . The 271 failure of the prediction of the nuclear staining of WAVE2 in U251 cells might indeed 272 suggest the actin filament - independent function of WAVE2 ( Figure 3 ) . The nuclear 273 11 staining of WAVE2 might represent either non - specific staining or the nuclear 274 localization of WAVE2 , as the nuclear localization of WAVE1 has been reported 275 ( Miyamoto and Gurdon , 2013 ) . Interestingly , such nuclear staining of WAVE2 was not 276 observed in Swiss 3T3 cells , suggesting that nuclear WAVE2 in U251 cells could be a 277 result of non - specific staining ( Figure 2 ) . Therefore , the prediction is thought to require 278 training dependent on the cell types , and might reflect the specific features of the cells . 279 These inconsistencies in WAVE2 localizations between the generated and true images 280 therefore might be due to insufficient learning , the randomness in experimental errors , 281 or the true difference in the localization and functions that resulted from the 282 independence of the observed pair of molecules . Further investigations will be required 283 to prove these ideas ; however , image correlation using the GAN might be performed to 284 investigate the known and unknown spatial relations of paired molecules using 285 localization images . 286 The prediction of protein localization could have great potential . The labeling 287 by antibodies is normally limited to several proteins . In contrast , artificial staining can 288 predict unlimited number of protein localizations from a single staining , which would 289 be useful to detect the relationships between many molecules . The prediction should be 290 complemented with the actual experiments . However , the prediction of molecule 291 localizations in cells would at least be useful to search for the direction of study when 292 dissecting the localization - related hierarchy of the proteins and their functions . 293 294 12 Material and Method 295 Cell culture 296 Plat - E , Swiss 3T3 , and U251 cells were cultured in Dulbecco ' s Modified Eagle 297 Medium ( DMEM ) ( Nacalai Tesque , 08459 - 64 ) , supplemented with 10 % fetal calf 298 serum ( FCS ) and penicillin – streptomycin ( PS ) ( DMEM - 10 % FCS / PS ) , at 37 °C in a 5 % 299 CO 2 incubator . The Plat - E , Swiss 3T3 , and A549 cells were passaged every 4 , 3 , and 2 300 d , respectively . 301 302 Retrovirus - mediated gene transfer 303 Swiss 3T3 cells were transfected using the pMX - Myc - Rac1 - CA vector 304 ( Suetsugu et al . , 1999a ) , as follows . First , Plat - E cells were cultured overnight in a 12 - 305 well plate in DMEM - 10 % FCS / PS . For gene transfer , 100 µL of Opti - MEM with 1 . 6 µg 306 of vector and 100 µL of Opti - MEM with 1 µL of 293 fectin transfection reagents 307 ( Thermo Fisher ) were mixed , allowed to form a complex at room temperature for 20 308 min , and then added to the Plat - E cells in 0 . 8 ml medium ( Kitamura et al . , 2003 ) . After 309 48 h , the culture supernatant was filtered using a 0 . 22 µm filter , and added to the cells in 310 1 . 2 ml medium with polybrene , at a concentration of 8 µg / mL . After 24 h , the medium 311 was replaced with fresh DMEM - 10 % FCS / PS . After an additional 24 h , the cells were 312 replated on a 24 - well plate containing a coverslip ( Matsunami ) and cultured for another 313 48 h . 314 The IRSp53 - knockout U251 cell line expressing GFP - IRSp53 was established 315 using CRISPR / Cas9 - mediated genome editing . The guide RNA targeting the second 316 exon ( 29 th amino - acid residue ) of IRSp53 ( CCATGGCGATGAAGTTCCGG ) was 317 designed using the server http : / / crispr . mit . edu ( Hsu et al . , 2013 ) and inserted into the 318 pX330 vector , which was transfected into the cells and then cloned ( Mashiko et al . , 319 2013 ) . The expression of GFP - IRSp53 and lifeact - mCherry was performed by using the 320 retrovirus as above , and then clones were isolated by using a fluorescence - activated cell 321 sorter . 322 323 Immunofluorescent staining of Swiss 3T3 and U251 cells 324 The cells were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room 325 temperature . Subsequently , they were permeabilized with 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 in PBS for 326 13 20 min at room temperature with gentle shaking . The cells were then washed with 0 . 1 % 327 Triton X - 100 in PBS ( PBS - T ) . Next , PBS containing 3 % bovine serum albumin and 328 10 % goat serum was added to block the cells for 1 h with gentle shaking . The cells were 329 then washed with PBS - T . The primary antibody , either a rabbit anti - WAVE2 antibody 330 ( Cell Signaling , # 3659S ) , a mouse anti - vinculin ( SIGMA , V 9131 ) , a mouse anti - alpha - 331 tubulin ( SIGMA , clone DM1A ) was diluted 100 - fold , 200 - fold , and 500 - fold 332 respectively , in the blocking solution , incubated for 1 h with gentle shaking , and then 333 washed three times with PBS - T . The secondary antibody , an Alexa Fluor 488 - goat anti - 334 rabbit or mouse IgG antibody ( highly cross - absorbed , Thermo - Fisher ) diluted 400 - fold , 335 and rhodamine - phalloidin ( Thermo - Fisher ) for actin filament detection , diluted 1 , 000 - 336 fold in the blocking solution , were added and then incubated for 1 h with gentle shaking 337 in the dark . The cells were then washed with PBS - T and mounted on a glass slide , using 338 Prolong Diamond Antifade Mountant with DAPI ( Thermo Fisher ) , allowed to solidify 339 at room temperature overnight , and then stored at 4 °C . Swiss 3T3 cells were observed 340 using an IX81 fluorescence microscope ( OLYMPUS ) with W - View Gemini 341 ( Hamamatsu Photonics ) . U251 cells and A549 cells were observed using an FV1000 342 confocal microscope ( Olympus ) . 343 344 Conditional GANs 345 The purpose of this study was to determine the conditional distribution of 346 WAVE2 based on actin filaments . The pix2pix conditional GAN ( Isola et al . , 2017 ) , 347 allows the patch discriminator to capture the Markov property of the image as an 348 adversarial loss , allowing the transformed image to maintain high spatial frequencies . 349 The formula for this adversarial learning is as follows : 350 where a generator 𝐺 translates images of actin filaments 𝑥 to WAVE2 images 𝑦 , 351 which are trained to translate images of actin filaments that a discriminator 𝐷 cannot 352 distinguish from the “real” WAVE2 images by antibody staining , as follows : 353 ℒ ! " # ( 𝐺 , 𝐷 ) = 𝔼 $ , & ~ ( ! " # " ( $ , & ) [ log 𝐷 ( 𝑥 , 𝑦 ) ] + 𝔼 $ ~ ( ! " # " ( $ ) , + ~ ( $ ( + ) 2log ( 1 − 𝐷5𝑥 , 𝐺 ( 𝑥 , 𝑧 ) 78 . ( 2 ) 𝐺9 = arg min ! max , ℒ ! " # ( 𝐺 , 𝐷 ) + 𝜆 ℒ - . ( 𝐺 ) , ( 1 ) 14 In addition to the adversarial loss , the conditional loss , which is the similarity between 354 the “fake” and “real” WAVE2 images , is introduced as follows : 355 ℒ - . ( 𝐺 ) = 𝔼 $ , & ~ ( ! " # " ( $ , & ) , + ~ ( $ ( + ) [ ‖𝑦 − 𝐺 ( 𝑥 , 𝑧 ) ‖ . ] , ( 3 ) where 𝑧 denotes the random noise . 356 We primarily followed this framework and extended the generator and 357 discriminator networks . In this study , the generator was replaced with a Bayesian U - Net 358 ( Hiasa et al . , 2019 ) for the uncertainty estimation . Spectral normalization ( Miyato et al . , 359 2018 ) was applied to the patch discriminator for stabilizing the optimization . In the 360 inference phase , the predictive distribution is expressed as 361 𝜇 [ 𝑦 ] = 𝔼 + ~ ( $ 𝐺 ( 𝑥 , 𝑧 ) , 𝑣𝑎𝑟 [ 𝑦 ] = 𝔼 + ~ ( $ ( 𝐺 ( 𝑥 , 𝑧 ) − 𝑦F ) , ( 4 ) where μ and var denote the mean and variance , respectively . 362 WAVE2 and actin filament images were downscaled to 256 × 256 pixels and 363 normalized such that the intensity of the [ 1st , 99th ] percentile was mapped to [ - 1 , 1 ] . 364 Data augmentation was applied based on spatial transforms , including the translation of 365 [ −10 , + 10 ] % of the image size , rotation of [ −10 , + 10 ] ° , scale of [ −10 , + 10 ] % , shear 366 transformation with the shear angle of [ −π / 16 , + π / 16 ] rad , and flipping in the horizontal 367 and vertical directions . The kernel size was 4 pixels , i . e . , ~ 1 . 9 μm 2 . The codes that were 368 used , including the details of each network and training manner , are available at 369 https : / / github . com / yuta - hi / bayesian _ unet . 370 Estimation of errors 371 The results were evaluated based on the MAE and SSIM . The MAE shows the 372 absolute error in the brightness value in each pixel and is expressed as 373 MAE ( 𝑓 / , 𝑦 / ) = 1 𝑛 L | 𝑓 / − 𝑦 / | 0 12 . , ( 5 ) where f i and y i denote the true and predicted values , respectively . 374 The SSIM indicates the similarity of the average , variance , and covariance of 375 surrounding pixels in terms of the brightness , contrast , and structure . Thus , it is an index 376 that incorporates the correlation not only with individual pixels but also with the 377 surrounding pixels . The SSIM is expressed as 378 15 SSIM ( x , y ) = 52µ $ µ & + 𝐶 . 752𝜎 $ & + 𝐶 3 7 ( µ $ 3 + µ & 3 + 𝐶 . ) ( 𝜎 $ 3 + 𝜎 & 3 + 𝐶 3 ) , ( 6 ) where x and y are the ground - truth ( WAVE2 ) and predicted images , respectively , µ is 379 the average pixel value , σ is the standard deviation of the pixel value , σ xy is the 380 covariance between x and y , C1 = ( 0 . 01 × L2 ) , C2 = ( 0 . 03 × L2 ) , and L is the dynamic 381 range of the images ( Wang et al . , 2004 ) . In this study , we used 8 - bit images ; hence , L = 382 255 . 383 The lamellipodia regions were manually annotated for SSIM calculations using 384 Labelme ( Russell et al . , 2008 ) ( https : / / github . com / wkentaro / labelme ) to extract the 385 SSIM values at the lamellipodia . 386 387 16 Data Availability Statement 388 The codes and datasets generated for this study are available upon request to the 389 corresponding authors . 390 391 Author contributions 392 KS , SJ , and TN performed the experiments .

Lamellipodia and WAVE2 localization in Swiss 3T3 cells . 411 ( A ) Schematic illustration of the configuration of actin filaments and WAVE2 412 localization at lamellipodia . Upon Rac1 activation , the WAVE2 in the protein complex 413 is activated , leading to the activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex for branched actin filament 414 formation . IRSp53 cooperates with WAVE2 for its activation by Rac1 at the plasma 415 membrane . 416 ( B ) Input image of actin filaments in Swiss 3T3 cells expressing the active form of 417 Rac1 . Actin filaments were stained by Rhodamine – phalloidin . Lamellipodia are fan - 418 shaped structures formed at cell edges . 419 ( C ) Actual WAVE2 image co - immunostained with ( B ) , showing accumulation at the 420 edges of lamellipodia . 421 ( D ) Progress of the WAVE2 image generation . Images are shown at every 2 , 500 422 iterations ( 1 epoch ) . The iteration number is shown in the images . Image generation 423 starts with a gray image without any features , as shown at iteration 0 . The arrow 424 indicates the lamellipodia . 425 Scale bars , 10 µm . 426 427 Figure 2 . Generation of WAVE2 images from actin filaments in Swiss 3T3 cells . 428 ( A ) Generation of a WAVE2 image by pix2pix from an actin - filament image . The cells 429 were stained with phalloidin for actin filaments and with an anti - WAVE2 antibody after 430 fixation and permeabilization . An input image ( actin filament image ) , an output image 431 ( generated WAVE2 image ) , a ground truth image ( WAVE2 immuno - stained image ) , an 432 absolute error image , and an uncertainty image are shown . The microspikes in the 433 lamellipodia are marked with dashed squares , and those outside of the lamellipodia are 434 marked with solid squares . Absolute error represents the difference in WAVE2 values 435 in each pixel . Uncertainty in image generation represents fluctuation of WAVE2 values 436 based on various “dropouts” in convolutional neural networks , i . e . , the robustness of the 437 generation in each pixel . With higher values of absolute errors and uncertainty , the color 438 of the heat map becomes closer to red . 439 Scale bars , 10 µm . 440 18 ( B , C ) Image generation of WAVE2 images of cells with various sizes of lamellipodia , 441 as shown in ( A ) .
