[ Pd ( Xantphos ) I 2 ] , which features a very large bite angle , has been found to facilitate the rapid carbonylation of azaarene - substituted allyl - amines into bioactive quinolizinones in good to excellent yields . This transformation represents the first dearomative carbonylation and is proposed to proceed by palladium - catalyzed C ¢ N bond activation , dearomatization , CO inser - tion , and a Heck reaction . Q uinolizinones and related molecules that contain an amide group and a nitrogen atom at the ring junction are a unique class of heterocycles with valuable physicochemical properties and are emerging as key pharmacophores for the treatment of Alzheimerˇs disease , Type 2 diabetes , HIV , and spinal muscular atrophy ( Figure 1 ) . [ 1 ] In spite of the long - standing biological and synthetic interest in these valuable compounds , it is surprising that a general method for the construction of such bicyclic ring systems has not been reported thus far . [ 2 ] Existing methods commonly rely on multistep syntheses , but their widespread use has been precluded by a restricted substrate scope , inconvenient reaction procedures , and lengthy syntheses of the reagents . A general catalytic method to various quinolizinones is therefore in high demand and would also serve to provide a great opportunity to accelerate biological and biosynthetic studies of these valuable compounds . [ 3 ] Transition - metal - catalyzed aminocarbonylation is a versa - tile process that has been strenuously developed and emerged as a convenient method for the synthesis of amides . [ 4 ] Among many efficient methods , the carbonylation of C ¢ N bonds , a strategy that involves transition - metal - catalyzed C ¢ N bond activation followed by insertion of CO to furnish the amide group , has proven to be one of the most direct and promising ways to access a range of valuable amides . [ 5 ] Allylamines are suitable substrates for such catalytic processes , as they can smoothly undergo oxidative addition with Pd 0 to cleave the C ¢ N bond for the generation of a p - allylpalladium species I and have thus been successfully applied in Pd - catalyzed aminocarbonylation reactions in the presence of CO ( Sche - me 1a ) . [ 6 ] However , once an azaarene such as pyridine or quinoline is introduced into the allylamine system , the p - allylpalladium species I generated by C ¢ N bond activation might be transformed into the dearomatized palladium amide species II , with the shift of the double bond incurred by dearomatization of the heterocycle . [ 7 ] We reasoned that the dearomatization process could be further enhanced in the presence of CO , owing to the lower electron density at Pd ( CO ) . [ 8 ] Moreover , CO would prefer to insert into the less hindered planar pyridyl N ¢ Pd bond , and the R 2 N ¢ moiety contained in metal complex II could then act as an intra - molecular base to promote the subsequent Heck reaction . It should thus be possible to realize a catalytic tandem reaction that consists of C ¢ N bond activation , dearomatization , CO insertion , and a Heck reaction for the synthesis of quinolizi - nones under palladium catalysis . Herein , we report the development of the first palladium - catalyzed dearomative cyclocarbonylation of azaarene - substituted allylamines , which provides biologically active quinolizinones ( Sche - me 1b ) . Notably , this transformation is mechanistically unique in comparison with traditional base - promoted pyri - Figure 1 . Examples of quinolizinone - containing bioactive molecules . Scheme 1 .

[ 7 ] Our investigations began with the direct cyclocarbonyla - tion of N , N - diisopropyl - 3 - ( pyridin - 2 - yl ) prop - 2 - en - 1 - amine ( 1a ) in toluene by palladium catalysis under CO atmosphere at 120 88 C ( Table 1 ) . After an extensive screening of catalysts , to our great delight , the desired product 2a was obtained in 67 % yield in the presence of a catalytic amount of PdI 2 ( 5 mol % ) and CO ( 10 atm ) . [ Pd ( cod ) I 2 ] was also an effective catalyst of this reaction , giving the carbonylation product in 63 % yield . As expected , no carbonylation took place without a catalyst ( entry 21 ) , and representative palladium catalysts , such as PdCl 2 , PdBr 2 , [ Pd ( CH 3 CN ) 2 Cl 2 ] , and [ { Pd ( allyl ) Cl } 2 ] , were not effective ( entries 1 , 2 , 5 , and 6 ) . Inspired by this promising lead , we next sought to improve the efficiency of the reaction . Various phosphine ligands were then screened in combination with PdI 2 as the catalyst precursor , and the transformation was found to be sensitive to the bite angle of the bis ( phosphine ) ligand ( entries 7 – 14 ) . [ 9 ] Catalysts derived from bis ( diphenylphosphino ) - type ligands , such as DPPE , DPPP , DPPF , or BINAP , resulted in low conversion into the desired product based on GC analysis . However , when DPPB , which features a larger bite angle , was used as part of the catalyst system , product 2a was obtained in 59 % yield . Moreover , further increasing the steric bulk and bite angle of the phosphine ligand by using Xantphos led to a substantial increase in catalytic activity , and the desired carbonylation product 2a was isolated in 81 % yield ( entry 12 ) . When NiXantphos , with a very similar bite angle , was used , the desired product was formed in an almost identical yield . The exceptionally high reactivity of the Xantphos - containing catalyst might be due to the unique structure of the ligand , which is capable of forming both cis and trans Pd complexes , thus facilitating the catalytic process . The huge bite angle of 154 . 78 88 can be clearly seen in the X - ray structure of [ Pd ( Xantphos ) I 2 ] . [ 10 ] Screening some representative solvents revealed that the reaction was most efficient in toluene , in which the desired product 2a was obtained in good yield ( entry 12 ) . The reaction reached completion in one hour to yield the corresponding product in 87 % yield ( entry 20 ) . With optimized reaction conditions in hand , substrates with various leaving groups were subjected to the standard conditions . As summarized in Table 2 , substrates containing different leaving groups ( 1a – 1h ) gave the desired product in distinctly different yields . For allylamines with N ( i Pr ) 2 , NEt 2 , or N ( Cy ) 2 as the leaving group , the cycloadduct 2a could be obtained in high yields even in one hour ( entries 1 – 3 ) . However , when other leaving groups , such as NPh 2 , NBn 2 , OH , OAc , or Cl , were installed in the allylic skeleton , the conversion was dramatically lower under identical reaction conditions ( entries 4 – 8 ) . The lower activity of these substrates might be attributed to either the difficult cleavage of the corresponding C ¢ X bonds or their reluctance to undergo a late - stage Heck reaction . [ 11 ] On the basis of the results described above , a variety of azaarene - substituted allylamines with N ( i Pr ) 2 as the leaving group were submitted to the Pd - catalyzed dearomative cyclocarbonylation reaction to investigate its substrate scope and generality ( Table 3 ) .

The reactivity was not affected by the E / Z ratio of the allylamines , and both the E and Z isomers could be efficiently converted into the desired cycloadducts . The position of the substituent on the pyridyl ring of the allyl - amine appeared to influence the reactivity . For example , substrate 1i , with a methyl group in the ortho position of the pyridyl ring , gave the corresponding product in a rather low yield ( 2i ) . Typical functional groups , such as fluorine and chlorine substituents , were also tolerated under the reaction conditions ( Table 3 , entries 6 – 9 ) , giving ample opportunities for further elaboration by transition - metal - catalyzed cou - plings or other transformations . To our delight , substrate 1q , which contains a hydroxymethyl group , also underwent this cyclocarbonylation , giving the desired product 2q in 73 % yield . The free hydroxymethyl group contained in the product is amenable to further elaboration by cross - coupling reac - tions . Furthermore , allylamines bearing an alkyl group on the double bond were also feasible substrates , affording the cyclocarbonylation products 2s , 2t , and 2u in excellent yields ( entries 12 – 14 ) . However , azaarene - substituted allylamines with a substituent in the a - position of the amine , such as N , N - diethyl - 1 - phenyl - 3 - ( pyridin - 2 - yl ) prop - 2 - en - 1 - amine and N , N - diisopropyl - 4 - ( pyridin - 2 - yl ) but - 3 - en - 2 - amine , could not be converted into the desired products ( see the Supporting Information ) . When the pyridine core was replaced with a pyrazine or quinoline , the cyclocarbonylation reaction still took place to give the corresponding carbonylation products 2v and 2w in 44 % and 52 % yield when the reaction time was increased ( entries 15 and 16 ) . The structures of 2o , 2q , and 2w were confirmed by single - crystal X - ray diffraction . [ 10 ] The synthetic versatility of the present catalytic system was next demonstrated through a large - scale reaction and product derivatizations ( Scheme 2 ) . The dearomative cyclo - carbonylation on a 10 mmol scale was found to be completed in twelve hours , even with a reduced amount of catalyst ( 1 . 0 mol % ) , yielding 1 . 24 g of cycloadduct 2a ( 86 % yield ) . Partial hydrogenation of 2a catalyzed by Pd / C afforded 3 , 4 - dihydro - 1 H - quinolizin - 6 ( 2 H ) - one ( 3a ) in 87 % yield under 1 atm of H 2 at room temperature . Complete hydrogenation of 2a to 3b could also be realized under 10 atm of H 2 at 50 88 C catalyzed by Pd / C . The desired hexahydro - 1 H - quinolizin - 4 ( 6 H ) - one was isolated in 98 % yield . Such moieties are common core structures found in numerous alkaloids and biologically active compounds . [ 12 ] Moreover , we have also developed an efficient formal synthesis of alkaloid 3d . As shown in Scheme 2 , full hydrogenation of 2q gave the desired product 3c in 85 % yield ; further reduction of 3c according to a previously reported procedure should then lead to 3d . [ 13 ] Although the mechanistic details of this transformation are not clear at this stage , on the basis of the present results and precedent reports , [ 6 ] a plausible reaction pathway was proposed ( Figure 2 ) . Under the reaction conditions , and in the presence of CO , an active Pd 0 species is expected to be formed , which undergoes oxidative addition with allylamine 1a to give p - allylpalladium intermediate I by cleavage of the C ¢ N bond . Dearomatization of I quickly takes place under Table 3 : Alkene substrate scope .

Subsequent double bond migratory insertion leads to intermediate IV , which undergoes syn b - hydride elimination to deliver the desired product 2a and reductive elimination to regenerate the active Pd 0 species to complete the catalytic cycle . [ 14 ] In summary , we have developed an unprecedented strategy for the cyclocarbonylation of azaarene - substituted allylamines with CO . This unique reaction was accomplished by synergistically combining palladium - catalyzed C ¢ N bond activation , dearomatization , carbonylation , and a Heck reac - tion . A wide range of azaarene - substituted allylamines are compatible with this operationally simple and efficient method , which could thus be employed for the synthesis of biologically active quinolizinones with a broad array of substitution and functionalization patterns . Further experi - ments are in progress to study the scope of this process and the application of this dearomative carbonylation strategy to other reactions .
