SUMMARY Mesenchymal cell motility is driven by polarized actin polymerization [ 1 ] . Signals at the leading edge recruit actin polymerization machinery to promote mem - brane protrusion , while matrix adhesion generates tractive force to propel forward movement . To work effectively , cell motility is regulated by a complex network of signaling events that affect protein activ - ity and localization . H 2 O 2 has an important role as a diffusible second messenger [ 2 ] , and mediates its effects through oxidation of cysteine thiols . One cell activity inﬂuenced by H 2 O 2 is motility [ 3 ] . How - ever , a lack of sensitive and H 2 O 2 - speciﬁc probes for measurements in live cells has not allowed for direct observation of H 2 O 2 accumulation in migrating cells or protrusions . In addition , the identities of proteins oxidized by H 2 O 2 that contribute to actin dy - namics and cell motility have not been characterized . We now show , as determined by ﬂuorescence life - time imaging microscopy , that motile cells generate H 2 O 2 at membranes and cell protrusions and that H 2 O 2 inhibits coﬁlin activity through oxidation of cysteines 139 ( C139 ) and 147 ( C147 ) . Molecular modeling suggests that C139 oxidation would steri - cally hinder actin association , while the increased negative charge of oxidized C147 would lead to electrostatic repulsion of the opposite negatively charged surface . Expression of oxidation - resistant coﬁlin impairs cell spreading , adhesion , and direc - tional migration . These ﬁndings indicate that H 2 O 2 production contributes to polarized cell motility through localized coﬁlin inhibition and that there are additional proteins oxidized during cell migration that might have similar roles . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION H 2 O 2 Is Elevated in Migrating Cell Protrusions To determine whether H 2 O 2 is increased in motile cells , we imaged cytoplasmic and plasma - membrane - targeted forms of the HyPer probe ( HyPer - cyto and HyPer - PM ; Figures S1A – S1G and S2A – S2E ) [ 4 , 5 ] by ﬂuorescence lifetime imaging micro - scopy ( FLIM ) [ 6 ] . Conﬂuent monolayers were wounded and HyPer ﬂuorescence lifetimes were measured in migrating and stationary cells . HyPer - cyto and HyPer - PM ﬂuorescence life - times were signiﬁcantly reduced in migrating cells , indicating higher cytoplasmic and plasma membrane H 2 O 2 ( Figures 1A and 1B ) . H 2 O 2 was also higher in protrusions , relative to cell bodies , of migrating HyPer - cyto - expressing cells ( Figures 1C and 1D ) , indicating that H 2 O 2 is elevated in migrating cells , with highest levels in protrusions . Protein Oxidation in Cell Migration Cell - permeable 5 , 5 - dimethyl - 1 , 3 - cyclohexanedione ( dimedone ) was used to label oxidized proteins by irreversible reaction with cysteine sulfenic acid ( Figure 2A ) [ 7 , 8 ] . Stationary conﬂuent cells and scratch - wounded migrating cells were left for 3 hr and then incubated with or without 5 mM dimedone for 1 hr ( Fig - ure 2B ) . Increased dimedone incorporation indicated that cell migration promotes protein oxidation . For identiﬁcation of oxidized proteins , a ﬁlter - aided sample preparation ( FASP ) method [ 9 ] concentrated proteins prior to tryptic digestion , followed by tandem mass spectrometry ( MS ) . Dimedone - conjugated peptides were identiﬁed by searching for 138 - Da mass - to - charge shifts rather than post - lysis 57 - Da iodoacetamide - induced shifts . Actin - regulating coﬁlin was identiﬁed with dimedone labeling on cysteines 139 ( C139 ) ( Figure 2C ) and 147 ( C147 ) ( data not shown ) . Immunoprecipita - tion and western blotting revealed that coﬁlin was more dime - done labeled in migrating relative to stationary cells ( Figures 2D and 2E ) . C139 and C147 Oxidation Inhibits Coﬁlin Activity Coﬁlin regulates cytoskeletal dynamics through activities including G - actin sequestration [ 10 ] . Based on the human coﬁlin structure ( PDB : 4BEX ) [ 11 ] and G - actin associated with the twin - ﬁlin C - terminal coﬁlin - like domain ( PDB : 3DAW ) [ 12 ] , a coﬁlin / G - actin model predicts C139 and C147 at the binding interface ( Figure 3A ) . Oxidation increases their van der Waals radii ( Figure 3B ) , which could block actin binding , particularly for C139 that sits adjacent to actin K328 ( Figure 3A ) . Electrostatic surface potential mapping suggests that C139 and C147 ( Fig - ure S3A ) oxidation to sulfenic ( Figure S3IB ) or sulﬁnic acid ( Fig - ure S3C ) would increase negative charges such that consequent 1520 Current Biology 25 , 1520 – 1525 , June 1 , 2015 ª 2015 The Authors electrostatic repulsion with actin surface residues , such as E241 located adjacent to coﬁlin C147 , could impair binding . Recombi - nant coﬁlin bound G - actin - ATP at a 1 : 1 ratio with 2 . 0 m M binding afﬁnity ( 1 / K A ) by isothermal titration calorimetry ( ITC ; Figure 3C ) , approaching previous values [ 13 ] . C139 and C147 were mutated to aspartic acid ( C139D / C147D ) , with their b - carboxylic acid mimicking the increased side - chain volume and negative charge of sulﬁnic acid . C139D / C147D protein folding was validated by thermal shift assay ( Figure S3D ) [ 14 ] , but G - actin binding was not detected by ITC ( Figure 3D ) , indicating decreased afﬁnity . Pelleting equivalent F - actin ( 21 m M ) by ultracentrifugation re - vealed that associated WT coﬁlin was signiﬁcantly reduced by 10 mM H 2 O 2 pre - treatment ( Figures 3E and 3F ) . However , C139A / C147A ( AA ) coﬁlin resisted the H 2 O 2 - induced reduction in F - actin association ( Figures 3E and 3F ) . Pelleting 10 m M F - actin with varying coﬁlin concentrations , with or without 10 mM H 2 O 2 pre - treatment , revealed (cid:1) 7 - fold lower associated coﬁlin after oxidation ( Figure 3G ) . These results indicate that oxidation inhibits coﬁlin binding to F - actin , consistent with reduced actin - coﬁlin binding following taurine chloramine treat - ment of lymphoma cells to induce coﬁlin oxidation [ 15 ] . For analysis of how coﬁlin oxidation affected F - actin regula - tion , ultracentrifugation separated 21 m M actin into G - actin supernatant ( S ) and F - actin pellet ( P ) fractions [ 16 ] . G - actin was entirely in the S fraction , while polymerization redistributed F - actin toward the P fraction ( Figure 3H ) . Addition of 10 m M coﬁlin shifted F - actin toward the G - actin S fraction , which was inhibited by 10 mM H 2 O 2 pre - treatment ( Figure 3H ) . Next , immo - bilized rhodamine - labeled 2 m M F - actin was incubated for 30 min with no addition ( Figure 3I , left ) , 1 m M coﬁlin ( Figure 3I , middle ) , or A HyPer - cyto Lifetime map B HyPer - PM 3 . 0 2 . 5 2 . 0 1 . 5 1 . 0 0 . 5 High H O 2 2 Low H O 2 2 F l uo r e sc en c e li f e t i m e ( n s ) HyPer - cyto C D S t a t i o n a r y M i g r a t i n g - 0 . 15 - 0 . 10 - 0 . 05 0 . 00 0 . 05 0 . 10 0 . 15 * * * C hange i n li f e t i m e ( n s ) S t a t i o n a r y M i g r a t i n g - 0 . 20 - 0 . 15 - 0 . 10 - 0 . 05 0 . 00 0 . 05 0 . 10 * * * C hange i n li f e t i m e ( n s ) C e ll b o d y P r o t r u s i o n - 0 . 2 - 0 . 1 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 * * * C hange i n li f e t i m e ( n s ) Figure 1 .

Determination of occurrence of F - actin ﬁlament lengths is described in Supple - mental Information . Untreated coﬁlin reduced the number of long F - actin ﬁla - ments ( > 0 . 5 m m ) , while 10 mM H 2 O 2 pre - treatment partially inhibited this effect on ﬁlaments > 2 . 5 m m and completely blocked the reduction in ﬁlaments between 0 . 5 and 2 . 5 m m ( Fig - ure 3J ) . These results indicate that coﬁlin oxidation reduced F - actin severing . Further support for this conclusion is based on pyrene - actin assays described in Figures S3E – S3K . Interest - ingly , C139 and C147 are not conserved in coﬁlin2 or actin - depo - lymerizing factor ( ADF ) , or in coﬁlin homologs across kingdoms , suggesting that regulation by oxidation may be restricted to coﬁlin and only in higher species [ 11 , 17 ] Coﬁlin Oxidation Contributes to Adhesion and Directional Cell Migration Dynamic and spatially restricted coﬁlin regulation of F - actin is required for membrane protrusions that promote cell spreading and adhesion [ 18 , 19 ] . The role of coﬁlin inactivation by oxidation in cells was determined by comparing the effects of wild - type or oxidation - resistant coﬁlin expression . The cell index ( CI ) parameter , which reﬂects spreading and adhesion [ 20 ] , was measured for MDAMB231 cells expressing mCherry ﬂuorescent protein ( Cherry ) , mCherry - coﬁlin ( Ch - CFL ) , or oxidation - resistant mCherry - coﬁlin C139 / 147A [ Ch - CFL ( AA ) ] ( Figure S4A ) . During the 3 hr after plating , Ch - CFL ( AA ) cells had signiﬁcantly lower CI than Cherry or Ch - CFL cells ( Figures 4A and 4B ) , indicating reduced adhesion , spreading , or both . To determine whether C139 or C147 oxidation was sufﬁcient for this effect , we com - pared mCherry - coﬁlin C139A [ Ch - CFL ( C139A ) ] or mCherry - coﬁlin C147A [ Ch - CFL ( C147A ) ] ( Figure S4B ) CI measurements with those of wild - type Ch - CFL . Although each substitution trended toward decreased CI , neither was statistically signiﬁcant ( Figures 4C and 4D ) . Ch - CFL ( AA ) cells had signiﬁcantly reduced adhesion 3 hr after plating ( Figure 4E ) that paralleled decreased Current Biology 25 , 1520 – 1525 , June 1 , 2015 ª 2015 The Authors 1521 CI ( Figure 4B ) , suggesting that reduced adhesion contributed to lower CI . Actin dynamics also contribute to cell stiffness [ 21 , 22 ] . Nanoindentation with atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) [ 23 ] re - vealed that Ch - CFL or Ch - CFL ( AA ) expression both signiﬁcantly increased the Young’s elastic modulus of individual MDAMB231 cells ( Figure 4F ) , indicating that coﬁlin functions independent of C139 / C147 oxidation to regulate cell stiffness . Tracking two - dimensional ( 2D ) individual cell movement for 4 hr after plating revealed that overall speeds of Cherry ( Figure 4G ) , Ch - CFL ( Fig - ure 4H ) , and Ch - CFL ( AA ) ( Figure 4I ) cells were unaffected , but directional motility of Ch - CFL ( AA ) - expressing cells was signiﬁ - cantly reduced relative to Cherry - expressing cells ( Figure 4J ) , indicating that localized coﬁlin oxidation contributes to maintain - ing persistent cell movement . We propose that H 2 O 2 is generated at migrating cell leading edges , and consequently oxidation of proteins such as coﬁlin is increased . Oxidation on C139 / C147 reduces coﬁlin activity , thereby enhancing either or both F - actin stability and net actin polymerization proximal to the front .

( E ) Fold increase of dimedone - labeled coﬁlin over total coﬁlin for migrating cells relative to stationary cells ( mean ± SEM , n = 3 ) . taneous chromophore - assisted laser in - activation revealed that active coﬁlin normally promotes lamellipodial F - actin turnover [ 24 ] . An additional potential contributing factor is that oxidized coﬁlin at plasma membranes is likely to be inac - tivated by membrane lipid association , unlike reduced coﬁlin that was shown to be insensitive to phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) - induced inhibi - tion [ 25 ] . Furthermore , coﬁlin oxidation might reduce competition with myosin II for F - actin binding , thereby enabling development of actin - myosin cortical ten - sion that contributes to cell motility inde - pendent of F - actin turnover [ 26 ] . Localized control of coﬁlin activity through oxidation enables cells to harness actin - myosin dynamics required for directional migration . Consistent with this , externally applied H 2 O 2 increased F - actin retrograde ﬂow , cell protrusions , and directional migration [ 27 ] . The number of proteins oxidized during cell migration ( Figure 2E ) suggests that more proteins regulated in this manner may contribute to actin cytoskeletal dynamics .

H 2 O 2 detection using HyPer fluorescent probes To detect H 2 O 2 in cells , we used the fluorescent probe HyPer that specifically detects H 2 O 2 due to a conformational change resulting from disulfide bond formation [ S1 ] that can be measured by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy ( FLIM ) [ S2 ] , which has the advantage of independence from fluorophore concentration . As HyPer localizes throughout the cytoplasm ( HyPer - cyto ) , a plasma - membrane targeted form was also made ( HyPer - PM ) by adding a carboxyl - terminal CAAX - prenylation motif [ S3 ] . HyPer - cyto and HyPer - PM were stably expressed in human MDAMB231 breast cancer cells ( Figure S1A ) , and positive cells enriched by flow cytometry ( Figure S1B ) . Fluorescence lifetimes in HyPer - cyto ( Figures S1C - G ) or HyPer - PM ( Figures S2A - E ) expressing cells were significantly and reversibly decreased when cells were treated with 3 mM H 2 O 2 . Reactive oxygen scavenging reduces cell migration To determine if elevated H 2 O 2 was required for 2 - dimensional migration induced by scratch wounding , cells were treated with N - acetylcysteine ( NAC ) , which significantly decreased cellular ROS as measured by the cell permeable reagent 2’ , 7’ - dichlorofluorescin diacetate ( Figure S2F ) . NAC - treated cell migration in a 96 - well kinetic assay , in which migration into a wound created through a confluent monolayer was measured , revealed a concentration dependent decrease in wound closure after 24 h ( Figures S2G and S2H ) , paralleling the reduced ROS levels observed with equivalent NAC concentrations ( Figure S2F ) . Figure S3 , relating to Figure 3 . Cofilin oxidation on C139 and C147 reduces F - actin severing . ( A ) Electrostatic potential map showing C139 and C147 without oxidation , or with the addition of ( B ) one oxygen or ( C ) two oxygen molecules . Introduction of oxygen at C139 and C147 increases negative electrostatic potential , which for C147 in particular would likely result in repulsion from E241 on actin . ( D ) Protein stability as determined by thermal shift assay , indicated by relative Sypro Orange fluorescence of C139D / C147D cofilin . T 1 / 2 was determined as 48 ° C from 8 independent determinations . ( Mean + SEM ) ( E ) Recombinant cofilin ( CFL ) was incubated with varying H 2 O 2 concentrations for 1 h . Remaining H 2 O 2 was quenched with catalase . Oxidation was validated with biotinylated - iodoacetamine ( biotin - IAA ) , remaining biotin - IAA was quenched by β - mercaptoethanol . Biotin - IAA labelling of cofilin was assessed by western blotting using AlexaFluor680 - conjugated streptavidin .

( K ) Relative end - point values of residual F - actin fluorescence intensity for wild - type and C139 / 147A cofilin with or without H 2 O 2 treatment after 300 s . ( Mean + SEM , n = 3 - 13 . One - way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc , * * p < 0 . 01 , ns = not significant ) . Cofilin oxidation inhibits activity To characterize the effect of cofilin oxidation on F - actin binding , we first confirmed in vitro oxidation of recombinant cofilin with increasing H 2 O 2 concentrations by labelling non - oxidized thiols with biotin - iodoacetamide ( biotin - IAA ) and measuring incorporation with fluorescent streptavidin . Biotin - IAA labeling of non - oxidized cofilin ( CFL ) decreased with increased H 2 O 2 ( Figure S3E ) . Cofilin activity was also measured using a pyrene - conjugated actin assay that reports on 2 cofilin activities : ( 1 ) regulation of F - actin levels [ S4 ] , which reflects filament severing , depolymerization and polymerization equilibrium ; ( 2 ) cofilin binding to F - actin due to the possibility of cofilin - mediated quenching of pyrene fluorescence . Cofilin oxidation , as determined by decreased biotin - IAA labeling of non - oxidized cofilin ( Figure S3E ) , paralleled the reduction in cofilin activity in the pyrene - actin assay ( Figures S3F and S3G ) . To identify cysteine residues sensitive to H 2 O 2 , we assayed C39A , C80A , C139A and C147A cofilin . Following oxidation with 10 mM H 2 O 2 , C139A and C147A were not significantly inhibited ( Figures S3H - J ) . C139 / 147A activity was significantly greater than wild - type cofilin prior to H 2 O 2 treatment , suggesting resistance to spontaneous oxidation ( Figures S3H and S3J ) . In addition , H 2 O 2 treatment of C139 / 147A did not significantly inhibit activity ( Figures S3I and S3K ) . Taken together , these results indicate that C139 and C147 are responsible for inhibition of cofilin activity following oxidation by H 2 O 2 , consistent with dimedone - labelling of C139 and C147 cofilin in cells ( Figure 2F ) . Given that oxidation inhibited F - actin binding ( Figures 3E - G ) and reduced its effect on F - actin structures ( Figure 3H - I ) , the simplest conclusion is that H 2 O 2 blocked cofilin activity on pyrene - labelled F - actin ( Figure S3F - K ) . Figure S4 , relating to Figure 4 . Expression of mCherry - fluorescent protein - cofilin fusion proteins . ( A ) MDAMB231 cells expressing Cherry fluorescent protein , Cherry - Cofilin ( Ch - CFL ) or Cherry - Cofilin C139 / 147A double mutant ( Ch - CFL ( AA ) ) western blotted with cofilin and Cherry antibodies . ( B ) MDAMB231 cells expressing Cherry - Cofilin ( Ch - CFL ) Cherry - Cofilin C139A ( Ch - CFL ( C139A ) ) or Cherry - Cofilin C147A ( Ch - CFL ( C147A ) ) western blotted with cofilin antibody . Supplemental Experimental Procedures Cell Culture MDAMB231 breast cancer cells were grown in DMEM ( Gibco ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) ( PAA ) , 2 mM L - glutamine ( Gibco ) , 10 U / ml penicillin and 10 µg / ml streptomycin ( Gibco ) and kept at 37 o C with 5 % CO 2 in a humidified incubator . MDAMB231 cell lines stably expressing HyPer - cyto , HyPer - PM , Cherry , Ch - CFL , Ch - CFL ( C139A ) , Ch - CFL ( C147A ) or Ch - CFL ( AA ) were grown and maintained as described above with the exception that the culture medium was also supplemented with 400 µg / ml G418 ( Formedium ) . Plasmid construction pHyPer - cyto was purchased from Evrogen . pHyPer - PM was constructed by introducing a C - terminal CAAX motif ( 5’ - AGC TTA AAA AGA TGA GCA AGG ACG GCA AGA AGA AGA AGA AGA AGA GCA AGA CAA AGT GTG TAA TTA TGT AAG - 3’ ) to the pHyPer - cyto plasmid . Plasmids for the expression of CFL Cys to Ala mutants ( C39A , C80A , C139A , C147A and C139 / 147A ) were generated from the pGEX - KG - hCFL WT plasmid [ S5 ] by site directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange II XL Site - Directed Mutagenesis Kit ( Agilent Technologies ) following the manufacturer’s protocol . Mutations were introduced using the following forward , and corresponding reverse , primers ; C39A ( 5’ - CGC AAG AAG GCG GTG CTC TTC GCG CTG AGT GAG GAC AAG - 3’ ) , C80A ( 5’ - GCT GCC AGA TAA GGA CGC GCG CTA TGC CCT CTA TGA TGC AAC C - 3’ ) , C139A ( 5’ - GAA TTG CAA GCA AAC GCG TAC GAG GAG GTC AAG GAC CGC - 3’ ) , C147A ( 5’ - GAG GAG GTC AAG GAC CGC GCG ACC CTG GCA GAG AAG - 3’ ) , C139D / C147D ( 5’ - GAA TTG CAA GCA AAC GAC TAC GAG GAG GTC AAG GAC CGC GAC ACC CTG GCA GAG AAG - 3’ ) . Ch - CFL plasmid was generated by amplifying the CFL from pGEX - KG - hCFL WT and cloning it into pmCherry - C1 plasmid . Ch - CFL ( AA ) , Ch - CFL ( C139A ) and Ch - CFL ( C147A ) were created by site directed mutagenesis as above using the C139A and C147A primers . Generation of stable cell lines MDAMB231 cells were transfected with HyPer - cyto or HyPer - PM plasmids using FuGENE HD transfection reagent ( Promega ) , or Cherry , Ch - CFL , Ch - CFL ( AA ) , Ch - CFL ( C139A ) or Ch - CFL ( 147A ) plasmids using Lipofectamine LTX transfection reagent ( Invitrogen ) following the manufacturers’ protocols . 48 h after transfection cells were selected in culture medium containing 400 µg / ml G418 , followed by enrichment by flow cytometry on a FACSaria ( BD Bioscience ) . Measurement of cellular ROS Cellular ROS levels were measured using the fluorescent probe DCFDA . MDAMB231 cells were seeded at 40 , 000 cells per well in a 96 - well plate and 24 h later were treated with NAC ( 0 , 2 . 5 , 5 or 10 mM ) for 6 h . Cells were washed once with PBS before incubation with 5 µM DCFDA in serum free ( SF ) and phenol red free DMEM at 37 o C for 30 min . Following a PBS wash and the addition of SF and phenol red free medium , DCFDA fluorescence was measured on a Tecan Safire II microplate reader ( excitation wavelength = 485 nm ; emission wavelength = 528 nm ; bandwidth = 5 nm ) . HyPer imaging by FLIM All fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy ( FLIM ) was carried out on a Nikon TE 2000 inverted microscope fitted with a Lambert Instruments FLIM Attachment ( LIFA ) and a Yokogawa CSU22 spinning disk unit . Images were acquired with the 488 nm laser and a Plan Apo 100x / 1 . 40 oil objective ( Nikon ) . Fluorescence lifetimes were measured using LI - FLIM software ( Lambert Instruments ) and results presented in a box and whiskers plot where the box represents the upper and lower quartiles , the middle line represents the median and the whiskers represent 5 - 95 percentiles . All cells for imaging were cultured in 35 mm glass bottom dishes and transferred to L15 culture medium ( Gibco ) 1 h before imaging . For the measurement of fluorescence lifetime following H 2 O 2 treatment , cells were grown until 50 % confluent and transferred to Optimem culture medium ( Gibco ) 24 h before imaging . Images were acquired every 30 sec for 15 min with 100 µl of 3 mM H 2 O 2 added after 2 min or every 30 sec for 30 min with 100 µl of 3 mM H 2 O 2 added after 2 min and after fluorescence lifetime had returned to starting levels . For the measurement of fluorescence lifetime in stationary and migrating cells , cells were grown until 100 % confluent and then a single wound was created through the center of the monolayer . Cells were then left for 1 h before being transferred to L15 medium for imaging . Wound healing cell migration assay Cell migration was assessed using the CellPlayer TM 96 - well cell migration assay ( Essen Bioscience ) following the manufacturer’s protocol . Briefly , cells were cultured in a 96 - well ImageLock TM plate until they formed a confluent monolayer and then a wound created using a WoundMaker TM tool . Cells were washed twice with medium followed by the addition of NAC ( 0 , 2 . 5 , 5 or 10 mM ) , the plate placed in the Incucyte TM machine to equilibrate for 10 min before starting image acquisition . Brightfield images of the wounds were taken every 2 h for 24 h and wound width at each time point measured by the Incucyte TM software . Measurement of cellular protein oxidation Oxidized proteins in cells were labelled and detected using the chemical dimedone . Cells were cultured in 6 - well dishes to form a confluent monolayer and then 30 wounds generated using a P10 pipette tip . After 3 h cell culture medium was removed , cells washed twice with SF culture medium and incubated in SF culture medium containing 5 mM dimedone at 37 o C for 1 h . Cells were then harvested and dimedone labelling of oxidized proteins determined by western blot analysis . Protein preparation and western blotting Cells were lysed using RIPA lysis buffer ( 10 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 5 , 5 mM EDTA , 150 mM NaCl , 40 mM Na pyrophosphate , 1 mM Na 3 VO 4 , 50 mM NaF , 1 % NP40 , 0 . 5 % Na deoxycholate , 0 . 025 % SDS , 1 mM PMSF , 1X complete protease inhibitor ) and protein concentration determined by bicinchoninic acid assay . For western blotting proteins were separated by SDS - PAGE on 4 - 12 % NuPAGE Bis - tris gels with NuPAGE MES running buffer ( Invitrogen ) and transferred to Protran nitrocellulose membrane ( GE Healthcare ) . Membranes were blocked with 5 % milk solution ( w / v ) and probed with antibodies to cofilin ( Abcam ab42824 , 1 : 1 , 000 ; Abcam ab75510 , 1 : 2 , 000 ) , dsRed ( Clontech 632496 , 1 : 1 , 000 ) , dimedone ( cysteine sulfenic acid ) ( Millipore 07 - 2139 , 1 : 5 , 000 ) or GFP ( Clontech 632380 , 1 : 2 , 000 ) . Visualization and quantification of Western blots was performed directly without signal amplification or X - ray film using infra - red emitting secondary antibodies and detection with an ODYSSEY ® infrared imaging system ( LI - COR ) . Immunoprecipitation At every stage protein G Sepharose beads were separated from the supernatant by centrifuging at 3 , 600 rpm for 1 min at 4 o C . Cells were washed with ice cold PBS , lysed in IP lysis buffer ( TBS , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 2 mM Na 3 VO 4 , 20 mM NaF , 1x complete protease inhibitor , 1 % ( v / v ) PMSF ) and then incubated at 4 o C for 20 - 30 min while rotating . Cell lysates were centrifuged at 13 , 200 rpm for 10 min and protein concentration of the supernatant determined . Equivalent quantities of lysate from each condition were incubated with 25 µl of TBS - washed protein G Sepharose bead solution for 30 min while rotating . After removing the beads , lysates were incubated with anti - cofilin antibody or mouse IgG at a 1 : 25 dilution overnight at 4 o C while rotating . 25 µl of TBS - washed protein G Sepharose bead solution was added to each tube and incubated for 1 h at 4 o C while rotating . Beads were washed 3 times in TBS , resuspended in 25 µl of prewarmed ( 95 o C ) 1 % SDS and heated at 95 o C for 5 min . Samples were centrifuged at 3 , 600 rpm for 2 min and the supernatant removed for further analysis . Recombinant protein production Overnight cultures of pGEX - KG - hCFL WT , pGEX - KG - hCFL C39A , pGEX - KG - hCFL C80A , pGEX - KG - hCFL C139A , pGEX - KG - hCFL C147A or pGEX - KG - hCFL C139 / 147A in E . coli BL21 ( DE3 ) pLys s cells were diluted 1 : 10 in L - broth containing 150 µg / ml ampicillin and grown in a shaking incubator at 37 o C until the OD 600 was between 0 . 6 and 1 . 0 . Cultures were induced with 100 µM IPTG and grown for a further 3 h in the shaking incubator at 37 o C . Protein expression from pGEX - KG - hCFL C139D / C147D was induced with 100 µM IPTG for ~ 20 h at 18 o C . Cells were pelleted by centrifuging at 4 , 000 rpm for 20 min at 4 C , resuspended in bacterial lysis buffer ( 1x TBS , 2x complete protease inhibitor , 3 mM DTT , 1 mg / ml lysozyme ) , lysates incubated on ice for 30 min , sonicated and then centrifuged at 14 , 000 rpm for 30 min at 4 o C . The supernatant was incubated overnight at 4 C with TBS - washed glutathione sepharose beads ( GE Healthcare ) . Beads were washed with wash buffer 1 ( 1x TBS , 3 mM DTT , 1 mM EDTA ) followed by wash buffer 2 ( 1x TBS , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM CaCl 2 , 3 mM DTT ) . CFL proteins were released from the GST tag by incubation with 50 U bovine thrombin ( Sigma ) overnight at 4 o C . Flow - through was collected , incubated with TBS - washed ρ - aminobenzamidine bead solution ( 50 % v / v ) , for 30 min at 4 o C while rotating and the supernatant containing the protein was collected , concentrated and aliquots stored at - 80 o C . Oxidation of recombinant CFL CFL was dialyzed to remove DTT from storage buffer and concentrated to 12 . 5 µg / µl . 50 µg of CFL was incubated with 20 µl of H 2 O 2 at the indicated concentrations ( up to 10 mM ) for 1 h on ice in the dark . Remaining H 2 O 2 was quenched by the addition of catalase . Labelling of recombinant CFL Oxidation of recombinant CFL was monitored by labelling with biotin - iodoacetamide ( IAA ) . 1 nmole of biotin - IAA was incubated with recombinant CFL for 20 min in the dark at room temperature . Remaining biotin - IAA was quenched by the addition of β - mercaptoethanol to a final concentration of 30 mM and biotin - IAA labelling of CFL assessed by SDS - PAGE and western blotting using Alexa Fluor 680 - conjugated streptavidin . In vitro cofilin activity assay G - actin was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle as described previously [ S6 ] and maintained in G - buffer ( 2 mM Tris – HCl pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 ) [ S5 ] . 1 mg / ml G - actin was labeled with 5 mg / ml pyrene in dimethylformamide for 15 h and dialyzed in G - buffer . Actin polymerization was initiated by the addition of 50 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , and 0 . 1 mM EGTA , and then ultracentrifuged to pellet the F - actin . The F - actin pellet resuspended in G - buffer and concentration determined . 2 µM F - actin was prepared by polymerizing 2 µM G - actin ( 95 % unlabelled ; 5 % labelled ) at room temperature for 2 - 3 h until steady state fluorescence ( excitation = 339 nm ; emission = 384 nm ) , as measured on a spectrofluorimeter , was reached . 50 µl of F - actin was added to a PTI glass cuvette , with or without 10 µM WT or mutant CFL , and fluorescence measured for 300 s . Data were presented as change in fluorescence over time . F - actin sedimentation assay The Actin Binding Protein Biochem Kit with Non - Muscle Actin ( Cytoskeleton ) was used according to manufacturer’s instructions . Aliquots of actin polymerization buffer and ATP were rapidly defrosted in a room temperature water bath and kept on ice . Cofilin1 samples were centrifuged for 1 h at 100 , 000 X g at 4 ° C , supernatants taken and kept on ice as test protein stocks . General actin buffer was supplemented with 0 . 2 mM final ATP . One 250 μg aliquot of actin was diluted to 1 mg / ml with 225 μl of ATP - supplemented general actin buffer , mixed to ensure complete re - suspension and left on ice for 30 min . 25 μl of actin polymerization buffer was pipetted into the actin protein and mixed well . The actin was incubated at room temperature for 1 h and kept as F - actin stock at 21 μM actin . All tubes were incubated at room temperature for 30 min , with untreated or H 2 O 2 treated cofilin at 10 μM added as indicated . Afterwards the tubes were centrifuged at 100 , 000 X g for 1 . 5 h at 24 °C . Supernatants were removed and kept on ice . To each tube 10 μl of 5× Laemmli reducing sample buffer was added . The pellets were re - suspended in 30 μl water by mixing for 2 min , leaving on ice for 10 min and repeated mixing . The samples were transferred into tubes and supplemented with 30 μl 2× Laemmli reducing - sample buffer . The samples were frozen at −20 °C until further analysis by SDS - PAGE . Quantification was performed with a Licor Odyssey by scanning the fluorescence intensity of SimplyBlue ( Invitrogen ) stained bands at 700 nm . In vitro F - actin severing assay Actin severing assay was performed as described in [ S7 ] . A mixture of monomeric unlabelled ( 1 . 4 µM ) , rhodamine - conjugated ( 0 . 4 µM ) and biotin - conjugated ( 0 . 2 µM ) muscle actin ( Cytoskeleton ) in General Actin Buffer ( Cytoskeleton ) was supplemented with 0 . 2 mM ATP according to manufacturer’s instructions . Actin Polymerization Buffer ( Cytoskeleton ) was added at 10 % volume / volume and the mixture incubated at room temperature for 2 h to make an F - actin stock that could be stored at 4 °C for up to 4 days . To affix to F - actin streptavidin - coated coverslips ( PolyAn GmbH ) , 5 µl of ISAP buffer ( 20 mM Tris pH 7 . 2 , 5 mM EGTA , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM ATP 1 mM DTT , 0 . 5 mg / ml BSA ) was spotted , left for 5 minutes and then removed . F - actin ( 5 µl ) was then placed onto the spot , left for 30 minutes , and then washed 3 times with 5 µl of 20 mM Tris pH8 , 50 mm NaCl . Next , 5 µl of 20 mM Tris pH8 , 50 mM NaCl buffer with no addition , 1 µM untreated cofilin or 1 µM cofilin that had been pretreated with 10 mM H 2 O 2 was added , left for 30 minutes and then washed 3 times with 5 µl anti - bleach buffer ( 20 mM Tris pH 7 . 2 , 5 mM EGTA , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM ATP 1 mM DTT , 5 mg / ml BSA , 0 . 036 mg / ml catalase , 6 mg / ml glucose , 0 . 02 mg / ml glucose oxidase ) . After the last wash , liquid was removed and the coverslip was sealed onto a glass slide with nail varnish and kept in the dark at 4 °C . Images were acquired with an Olympus BX51 fluorescence microscope using a 100X oil - immersion objective at 1 - 2 sec exposures . For analysis of actin filament lengths , a macro was written for ImageJ in which the user selects a directory containing all the images for a certain condition and it processes each image in turn and saves the results automatically . Upon loading of each image , a duplicate was made and used for creation of a mask . Removal of uneven illumination artefacts was achieved by using the default ImageJ ‘Background subtraction’ method with the sliding parabola model and a radius of 16 pixels . The image was then automatically thresholded using a minimum value of : min = mean + standard deviation , and max = maximum / 3 , to produce a mask that was then applied to the original image . This process removed the background noise bias introduced in the Gray - Level Co - occurrence Matrix ( GLCM ) analysis by selecting only the fluorescent signal . The masked image was then passed to the GLCM texture plugin , which had been modified so that it could be operated in a nested loop for varying pixel comparison distances and alternative directions of comparison . The output of the plugin for each image was 100 rows of the five texture parameters over each of four directions , so in total 2000 parameter values . These were saved as a text data file for each image . When all the images in the directory were analysed , the data files were processed using a Matlab script that eventually gave the mean of each texture parameter for each image . These were then imported into GraphPad Prism for plotting . Thermal shift assay A protein thermal fluorescence assay was undertaken to assess cofilin stability , using the Protein Thermal Shift kit ( Life Technologies ) according to manufacturer’s instructions . Briefly , 5 μl of Protein Thermal Shift Buffer was mixed with 2 . 5 μl Protein Thermal Shift Dye ( 8x ) and 12 . 5 μl protein . The protein melting was performed on a Applied Biosystems 7500 FAST Real - Time PCR system , on a curve from 25 °C to 95 °C . All measurements were done in quadruplicate . Cell adhesion / spreading assay Kinetics of cell adhesion and spreading were measured using the xCelligence Real - Time Cell Analyzer ( RTCA ) system ( Roche ) . 10 , 000 cells were plated in an E - plate 16 and placed in the RTCA in a humidified incubator at 37 o C with 5 % CO 2 . Cell index was measured every 10 min for 3 h . Cell adhesion assay 50 µl of culture medium was added to each well of a 96 - well tissue culture plate and incubated in standard culture conditions for 1 h . 40 , 000 cells in 100 µl culture medium were plated in each well and left for 3 h in standard culture conditions . Wells were washed 4 times with PBS to remove non - adherent cells and the number of adherent cells measured using the CellTiter Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay following the manufacturer’s protocol . Cell directionality assay Cells were seeded at a subconfluent density in a 6 - well tissue culture plate and placed on a Nikon TE 2000 Timelapse microscope fitted with an incubation chamber set at 37 o C with 5 % CO 2 . Cells were left for 1 h to allow the cells to settle and for the plasticware to equilibrate . Brightfield images were acquired every 10 min for 4 h with a 10x objective . Migration of 8 - 12 individual cells per well was analyzed in ImageJ using the manual tracking and chemotaxis tool plugins . Force indentation acquisition Mechanical properties of individual cells were measured using an atomic force microscope NanoWizard II ( JPK Instruments ) mounted on an inverted optical microscope , Zeiss Axio Observe with a cell heater attachment . Force indentation measurements were carried out using in - house prepared AFM colloidal probes ( ~ 5 µm spherical silica bead cantilevers , with a typical spring constant of ~ 0 . 02 N / m ) as described previously [ S8 ] . Calibration measurements were performed before every experiment to determine the spring constant for each cantilever as described in reference [ S9 ] . Cells were cultured overnight prior to force indentation measurements . Five consecutive force ( 1 nN ) indentations were applied over the nucleus of each cell . The Hertzian spherical model was applied to the force spectroscopy data to deduce the elastic modulus of the cell structure [ S10 ] . 3D modelling of cofilin - actin interface The model of cofilin and actin was created based on the crystal structure of the CFL ( PDB ID : 4BEX ) [ S11 ] , and the crystallized complex of G - actin and the C - terminal domain of twinfilin ( PDB ID : 3DAW ) [ S12 ] . Charges and radii of the atoms in the structure were calculated using PDB2PQR [ S13 ] , except for the charges and radii of the oxidized cysteines which were calculated using a developmental version of PRODRG [ S14 ] . Electrostatic surface potentials were calculated using APBS [ S15 ] . Figures were created in PyMOL ( The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System , Version 1 . 5 . 0 . 4 Schrödinger , LLC ) . Isothermal titration calorimetry Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments were performed at 25 °C in a Microcal iTC 200 ( GE Healthcare ) . Cofilin and actin were dialysed against 10 mM Tris pH 7 . 6 , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 2 mM β - mercaptoethanol . The sample cell was filled with G - actin at a concentration of 30 μM , and titrated against Cofilin in the syringe at a concentration of 1 . 2 mM . 2 μl injections were done every 180 seconds . Controls were performed by injecting cofilin into buffer , or buffer into G - actin . Data were analysed using the ORIGIN software , version 7 . 0 . Mass spectrometry The protein lysate was digested using the filtered aided sample preparation ( FASP ) protocol [ S16 ] with minor adjustments . Briefly , the protein was digested in spin ultrafiltration units with a nominal molecular weight “cut - off” of 30 , 000 Da . Lysate containing ~ 500 µg of protein was taken and diluted with 200 µL of 8 M urea in 0 . 1 M Tris / HCl , pH 8 . 5 ( UA ) . The sample was centrifuged at 14 000 × g at 20 °C for 15 min . The filter was then washed with an addition of 200 µL UA and centrifuged as before . 100 µL of 0 . 05 M iodoacetamide in UA was added to the filter and the sample was incubated in darkness for 20 min at room temperature . The filter was washed twice with 100 µL of UA followed by two washes with 100 µL 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate . Proteins were digested in 40 µL 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate using trypsin at enzyme to protein ratio 1 : 100 at 30 °C for 18 h . The released peptides were collected by centrifugation at 14 000 × g for 10 min followed by one wash with 50 µL 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate . The peptides were fractionated using a high pH reverse phase liquid chromatography strategy in a similar approach as Ding et al . [ S17 ] . The separation was performed using a Durashell RP column ( 5 µm , 150 Å , 250 mm × 4 . 6 mm i . d . ) . Mobile phases A ( 2 % acetonitrile , adjusted pH to 10 . 0 using NH3•H20 ) and B ( 98 % acetonitrile , adjusted pH to 10 . 0 using NH3•H20 ) were used to develop a gradient . The solvent gradient was set as follows : 4 % B , 6 min ; 4 % - 28 % B , 42 min ; 28 % - 50 % B , 50 min . The peptides were separated at an eluent flow rate of 1 . 0 mL / min and monitored at 220 nm . Fractions were collected every 1 . 5 min . The first five and last five were pooled and dried under vacuum along with the other fractions . Each fraction was then reconstituted in 40 µL of 0 . 1 % ( v / v ) FA , 2 % ( v / v ) acetonitrile in water . 18 µL were taken and analyzed by LC - MS on a LTQ - Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer system coupled to a Proxeon Easy - LC HPLC system . The peptide mixtures were loaded onto a C18 guard column ( 1 . 9 µm particle size ; 0 . 1 × 20 mm ) equilibrated in 0 . 1 % formic acid / water at 5 μl / min and then separated on a C18 packed emitter ( 1 . 9 µm ; 0 . 075 × 150 mm equilibrated in 0 . 1 % formic acid / water ) . Peptides were eluted with a solvent gradient as follows : 5 % - 27 % B , 42 min ; 27 % - 48 % B , 55min at a flow rate of 200 nl / min . The emitter was mounted on a Proxeon Flex nanospray source modified with a column oven and a voltage of 1 . 8 kV was applied to the emitter . The orbitrap was set to analyze the survey scans ( m / z 350 - 1600 ) at 60000 resolution and top 10 ions in each duty cycle ( minimum ion intensity of 1000 cps ) were selected for MSMS in the LTQ linear ion trap . Raw files were converted to peak lists in Mascot generic format ( MGF ) files using RAW2MSM using default parameters . MGF files were searched using a Mascot 2 . 4 . 1 in - house server against the Swissprot HUMAN database ( 148212 sequences ; 54777677 residues ) . Raw files were also searched against the same database using MaxQuant 1 . 4 . 1 . 6 in both cases allowing for Dimedone modification . Data was combined using Scaffold software ( Version 4 . 3 . 4 , Proteome Software Inc . ) . Statistical analysis Statistical significance was determined by unpaired t - test ( Figures 1A , 1B , 1D , 3F , S1D , S2B ) or one - way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s ( Figure 4B , 4D , 4E , 4F , 4J , S1G , S2E , S2F , S2H , S3G , S3J , S3K ) multiple comparison test using GraphPad Prism software as indicated . Histograms depict means + SEM , box and whiskers plots represent the upper and lower quartiles , the middle line represents the median and the whiskers represent 5 - 95 percentiles .
