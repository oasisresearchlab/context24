OPEN ORIGINAL ARTICLE The Arkadia - ESRP2 axis suppresses tumor progression : analyses in clear - cell renal cell carcinoma A Mizutani 1 , 2 , D Koinuma 1 , H Seimiya 2 and K Miyazono 1 Tumor - speci ﬁ c alternative splicing is implicated in the progression of cancer , including clear - cell renal cell carcinoma ( ccRCC ) . Using ccRCC RNA sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas , we found that epithelial splicing regulatory protein 2 ( ESRP2 ) , one of the key regulators of alternative splicing in epithelial cells , is expressed in ccRCC . ESRP2 mRNA expression did not correlate with the overall survival rate of ccRCC patients , but the expression of some ESRP - target exons correlated with the good prognosis and with the expression of Arkadia ( also known as RNF111 ) in ccRCC . Arkadia physically interacted with ESRP2 , induced polyubiquitination and modulated its splicing function . Arkadia and ESRP2 suppressed ccRCC tumor growth in a coordinated manner . Lower expression of Arkadia correlated with advanced tumor stages and poor outcomes in ccRCC patients . This study thus reveals a novel tumor - suppressive role of the Arkadia - ESRP2 axis in ccRCC . Oncogene ( 2016 ) 35 , 3514 – 3523 ; doi : 10 . 1038 / onc . 2015 . 412 ; published online 2 November 2015 INTRODUCTION Alternative mRNA splicing is a crucial event during normal development and , therefore , tightly regulated in various biological processes . 1 , 2 Aberrant alternative splicing may occur in certain pathophysiological conditions , including tumor progression and cancer metastasis . 1 , 3 Alternative splicing is modulated by various splicing regulatory proteins , and abnormal splicing pro ﬁ les in cancer cells are caused by altered activity or expression levels or mutations in these proteins , rather than mutations in target genes . 4 For example , splicing occurs in the second half of the third immunoglobulin - like domain of ﬁ broblast growth factor receptor 1 – 3 ( FGFR1 – 3 ) , leading to differential binding speci ﬁ cities to FGF family ligands . 5 FGF2 ( also known as basic FGF ) and some FGF ligands preferentially bind to the IIIc isoform of FGFRs , whereas FGF7 ( also known as keratinocyte growth factor ) and other FGFs preferentially bind to the IIIb isoform of FGFRs . 5 , 6 Recently , FGFR2 IIIc ( the IIIc isoform of FGFR2 ) , but not FGFR2 IIIb , was shown to be expressed in clear - cell renal cell carcinoma ( ccRCC ) , accompanied by decreased expression of epithelial splicing regulatory protein 1 ( ESRP1 ) mRNA , resulting in the acquisition of a mesenchymal and malignant phenotype of ccRCC cells . 7 ESRP1 and ESRP2 are splicing regulators speci ﬁ cally expressed in epithelial cells , and promote epithelial type splicing . 8 In addition to FGFRs , ESRP1 and ESRP2 are known to regulate the splicing of numerous genes , including STE20 - like kinase ( SLK ) , integrin α 6 ( ITGA6 ) , tuberous sclerosis 2 ( TSC2 ) , enabled homolog ( ENAH , also known as Mena ) , CD44 and catenin δ 1 ( CTNND1 , also known as p120 - catenin ) , some of which are involved in regulation of the function of cytoskeleton and cell motility . 9 Expression of ESRP1 and ESRP2 is transcriptionally decreased during the process of epithelial - to - mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) , accompanied by malignant progression in epithelial - type cancers . 10 Transforming growth factor - β ( TGF - β ) is a potent inducer of EMT 11 and suppresses the expression of ESRP2 in mouse mammary epithelial NMuMG cells through induction of zinc - ﬁ nger transcription factors ZEB1 and ZEB2 . 12 Arkadia , also known as RNF111 , is a RING - type E3 ligase that has a key role in vertebrate development and pathophysiology by enhancing TGF - β signaling activities . Arkadia induces ubiquitin - dependent degradation of negative regulators of the TGF - β signaling pathways , including Smad7 , c - Ski and SnoN ( also known as Skil ) . 13 – 15 Arkadia exhibits both pro - and antitumorigenic functions , 16 , 17 consistent with TGF - β signaling having bidirectional roles in the progression of cancer in a context - and cell type - dependent manner . 11 , 18 Moreover , recent data have revealed that Arkadia has important functions independent of TGF - β signaling , including the stimulation of endocytosis of epidermal growth factor receptor , 19 assistance with the DNA damage response 20 and stimulation of arsenic - induced degradation of polysumoylated PML protein . 21 In the present study , we used ccRCC RNA - sequencing ( RNA - seq ) data from The Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA ) and found that ESRP2 is expressed in ccRCC . We also con ﬁ rmed that ESRP1 expression is strongly decreased in most ccRCC patients . 7 Interestingly , the function of ESRP2 , not its mRNA expression , appeared to correlate with the prognosis of ccRCC patients . On the basis of analyses of the TCGA ccRCC data , we determined Arkadia as a candidate for regulating ESRP2 - splicing function . Here , we report that Arkadia is a tumor suppressor in ccRCC through modulation of the splicing function of ESRP2 . RESULTS ESRP2 , but not ESRP1 , expression is maintained in ccRCC According to TCGA RNA - seq data analyses , tumor samples from ccRCC express the FGFR2 IIIc isoform , whereas paired normal samples express the FGFR2 IIIb isoform . 7 In addition , the previous 1 Department of Molecular Pathology , Graduate School of Medicine , The University of Tokyo , Tokyo , Japan and 2 Division of Molecular Biotherapy , Cancer Chemotherapy Center , Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research , Ariake , Koto - ku , Tokyo , Japan .

We also analyzed the ccRCC RNA - seq data obtained from TCGA and found that the expression of ESRP2 , but not ESRP1 , was maintained in ccRCC tumor samples , although the levels of ESRP2 were lower in ccRCC tumor samples compared with paired normal samples ( Figure 1a and Supplementary Figure S1 ) . FGFR2 IIIc / IIIb expression ratios did not correlate with the ESRP2 mRNA expression levels ( Figure 1a ) . Next , we performed quantitative real - time PCR ( qRT – PCR ) to examine the expression of ESRP1 and ESRP2 mRNA in cultured renal cells . Although we failed to detect ESRP1 expression in the ccRCC cell line OS - RC - 2 and human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293T , we detected ESRP2 mRNA in both OS - RC - 2 and HEK293T cells ( Figures 1b and c ) . We also detected the expression of ESRP2 protein in HEK293T cells by immunoblot analysis ( Figure 1d ) . To determine whether residual ESRP2 in ccRCC cells is functional , we performed a transwell cell migration assay and wound healing assay after knocking down ESRP2 in OS - RC - 2 cells . ESRP1 / 2 have been reported to be involved in the splicing of molecules that regulate the function of cytoskeleton and cell motility . 9 , 22 We found that knocking down ESRP2 expression promoted transwell cell migration and two - dimensional cell migration ( Figures 1e and f ) , suggesting that residual ESRP2 is functional in ccRCC . Correlation of the expression of ESRP - target exons with Arkadia expression in ccRCC We examined the relationship between the expression of ESRP2 mRNA and the prognosis of ccRCC patients using RNA - seq data and clinical data obtained from TCGA . The ESRP2 mRNA expression levels did not correlate with the overall survival rate of ccRCC patients ( Figure 2a ) . However , high expression levels of some ESRP - target exons , including ENAH exon 11a , ITGA6 exon 27 and SLK exon 13 , were signi ﬁ cantly correlated with longer overall survival rates ( Figures 2b – d ) , suggesting that the splicing function , not mRNA expression , of ESRP2 is important for prognosis in ccRCC . Therefore , we hypothesized that certain factors regulate splicing function of ESRP2 . To determine the regulators of the splicing function of ESRP2 , we analyzed the ccRCC RNA - seq data obtained from TCGA using ESRP - target exon expression as the ESRP functional index . We found that the expression of ESRP - target exons shown in Figures 2b – d correlated with the expression of Arkadia mRNA ( Figures 2e – g ) , but not that of ESRP2 mRNA ( Figures 2h – j ) . Taken together , these ﬁ ndings suggest that Arkadia is a functional regulator of ESRP2 . Arkadia interacts with ESRP2 To examine whether the expression of ESRP - target exons correlate with that of Arkadia in cellulo , we knocked down Arkadia in HEK293T and OS - RC - 2 cells and measured the expression of ESRP - target exons . We found that the expression of some ESRP - target exons decreased upon knockdown of Arkadia ( Figures 3a and b ) , supporting the notion that Arkadia is an ESRP2 regulator . In contrast , Arkadia showed varied effects on the total mRNA expression levels of ITGA6 , SLK and TSC2 in HEK293T cells and ENAH in OS - RC - 2 cells ( Supplementary Figure S2 ) . To investigate whether Arkadia is a direct modulator of ESRP2 , we performed immunoprecipitation studies using HEK293T cells co - transfected with Myc - tagged Arkadia and HA - tagged ESRP1 or ESRP2 , and found that Arkadia physically interacts with ESRP1 and ESRP2 ( Figures 3c and d ) . The interaction between endogenous Arkadia and endogenous ESRP2 was also observed in HEK293T cells ( Figure 3e ) , suggesting that Arkadia interacts with ESRP2 and directly modulates the splicing function of ESRP2 . Arkadia is known to enhance TGF - β signaling through the degradation of Smad7 , c - Ski and SnoN , 14 , 15 , 23 – 25 but in HEK293T kidney cells and OS - RC - 2 ccRCC cells , both Arkadia and ESRP2 mRNA levels decreased after TGF - β stimulation ( Supplementary Figure S3 ) . - 15 - 5 5 15 Anti - ESRP2 siRNA Anti - α - tubulin Log 2 ( III c / III b r a t i o ) 0 10 20 0 5 10 15 F P K M F P K M ESRP2 ESRP1 FGFR2 Tumor Paired normal 0 1 2 n . d . n . d .

Arkadia - ESRP2 axis suppresses progression of ccRCC A Mizutani et al 3516 Oncogene ( 2016 ) 3514 – 3523 © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited strongly decreased when an Arkadia CA mutant with lower E3 ligase activity was co - transfected ( Figures 4a and b ) . Ubiquitin molecules form polyubiquitin chains covalently linked through one of the seven lysine residues ( i . e . , Lys6 , Lys11 , Lys27 , Lys29 , Lys33 , Lys48 or Lys63 ) , or through an amino - terminal Met1 residue . 26 To determine which lysine residues form polyubiquitin chains , we prepared ubiquitin mutants in which lysine residues were substituted by arginine residues . In the 7KR mutant , all seven lysine residues were substituted by arginine residues ; in the other ubiquitin mutants , one lysine residue ( 6 , 11 , 27 , 29 , 33 , 48 or 63K ) was intact , but the other lysine residues were substituted by arginine residues . The ubiquitin mutants were co - transfected with Arkadia and ESRP1 or ESRP2 in HEK293T cells , followed by immunoprecipitation . Polyubiquiti - nated ESRP1 and ESRP2 were not observed when the 7KR mutant was co - transfected ( Figures 4c and d ) . Interestingly , poly - ubiquitination of ESRP1 and ESRP2 was observed when the 27K mutant was co - transfected , but it was attenuated when the other ubiquitin mutants were co - transfected ( Figures 4c and d ) . These ﬁ ndings suggest that polyubiquitination of ESRP by Arkadia occurs on Lys27 of ubiquitin molecules , and imply that it may have other functions than orientation to degradation . 26 To investigate whether ubiquitination of ESRP2 by Arkadia modi ﬁ es the splicing function of ESRP2 , we made several ESRP2 - KR mutants ( Figure 4e ) . The Exo - KR mutant had one lysine residue in the exonuclease domain replaced with arginine residue . We also prepared KR - a , KR - b and KR - c mutants in which lysine residues in the carboxy - terminal portion were replaced with arginine residues , and RRM1 - KR , RRM2 - KR and RRM3 - KR mutants in which lysine residues within or near each RRM domain were replaced with arginine residues . The expression levels of all these mutants were con ﬁ rmed ( Figure 4f ) . To determine which lysine residues in ESRP2 are targets of Arkadia and important for the splicing function of ESRP2 , we examined the expression of ENAH exon 11a as an ESRP2 functional index , using HEK293T cells overexpressing the ESRP2 - KR mutants after knocking down Arkadia ( Figure 4g ) . We found that the expression of ENAH exon 11a was not signi ﬁ cantly altered upon knockdown of Arkadia when RRM2 - KR and RRM3 - KR mutants , but not the other mutants , were overexpressed ( Figure 4g ) , indicating that Arkadia ubiquiti - nates lysine residues in the RRM2 and RRM3 domains of ESRP2 and modulates the ENAH splicing ability of ESRP2 . These ﬁ ndings suggest that Arkadia ubiquitinates ESRP2 and potentiates the splicing function of ESRP2 ( Figure 4h ) . * Arkadia ENAH exon 11a R e l a t i ve ex p r ess i on N o r m a li z e d t o G A P DH R e l a t i ve ex p r ess i on N o r m a li z e d t o E NAH 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 Arkadia R e l a t i ve ex p r ess i on N o r m a li z e d t o G A P DH ESRP1 - HA - + + 6Myc - Arkadia WT - - + ESRP2 - HA - + + 6Myc - Arkadia WT - - + IP : Anti - Myc IB : Anti - HA IB : Anti - HA IB : Anti - Myc IP : Anti - Myc IB : Anti - HA IB : Anti - HA IB : Anti - Myc IP : IB : Anti - ESRP2 IB : Anti - Arkadia 0 0 . 05 0 . 1 0 . 15 0 . 2 SLK exon 13 * * R e l a t i ve ex p r ess i on N o r m a li z e d t o S L K 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 ITGA6 exon 27 * * R e l a t i ve ex p r ess i on N o r m a li z e d t o I T G A 6 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 TSC2 exon 27 * R e l a t i ve ex p r ess i on N o r m a li z e d t o T S C 2 HEK293T cells OS - RC - 2 cells 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 Figure 3 .

We did not observe any differences in the half - life periods of wild - type ESRP2 and its mutants in the presence of Arkadia , suggesting that the ubiquitination of ESRP2 by Arkadia does not induce protein degradation , in agreement with the observation that ubiquitination of ESRP by Arkadia may occur on Lys27 of ubiquitin molecules ( Figures 4c and d ) .

Arkadia - ESRP2 axis suppresses progression of ccRCC A Mizutani et al 3518 Oncogene ( 2016 ) 3514 – 3523 © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited isoforms that were up - or downregulated by knocking down Arkadia or ESRP2 . The 2×2 contingency matrices showed that Arkadia and ESRP2 act in a signi ﬁ cantly coordinated manner in OS - RC - 2 and HEK293T cells ( Figures 5a and b ) . To investigate which gene sets are enriched in the genes regulated by both ESRP2 and Arkadia , we performed preranked gene set enrichment analysis using the RNA - seq data in OS - RC - 2 cells ( Supplementary Tables S1 – S4 ) . Analysis using oncogenic signatures c6 gene sets in Molecular signatures database showed that several tumor - promotive gene sets , including the WNT _ UP . V1 _ UP gene set ( normalized enrichment score 1 . 97 ) and the KRAS . 600 _ UP . V1 _ UP ( normalized enrichment score 1 . 90 ) , were enriched in genes downregulated by ESRP2 and Arkadia ( Supplementary Table S1 ) . Validation of the RNA - seq in OS - RC - 2 cells was carried out in OS - RC - 2 cells using another small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) for ESRP2 to exclude the possibility of off - target effects because of the low knockdown ef ﬁ ciency of ESRP2 ( Figure 5c and Supplementary Figure S5a ) . We found the expression of some factors promoting cell proliferation , including NRP1 ( encoding neuropillin - 1 ) , GCLM ( encoding glutamate - cysteine ligase , modi ﬁ er subunit ) , HBEGF ( encoding heparin - binding epidermal growth factor - like growth factor ) and PPP2CB ( encoding protein phosphatase 2 , catalytic subunit , β - isozyme , PP2C β ) , increased upon knockdown of Arkadia or ESRP2 . Similar tendency was observed on the expression of these genes , except for HBEGF , in HEK293T cells by qRT – PCR ( Figure 5d and Supplementary Figure S5b ) . Preranked gene set enrichment analysis using gene ontology ( GO ) biological process c5 BP gene sets in Molecular signatures database showed that POSITIVE _ REGULATION _ OF _ CELL _ PROLI - FERATION gene set was enriched in genes downregulated by ESRP2 and Arkadia ( normalized enrichment score 1 . 80 ; Supplementary Table S3 ) , indicating that ESRP2 and Arkadia show suppressive effects on cell proliferation . To examine the effect of ESRP2 and Arkadia on cell proliferation , we performed cell count assays in HEK293T cells and OS - RC - 2 cells , and a bromodeoxyur - idine ( BrdU ) assay in OS - RC - 2 cells ( Figures 5e – g and Supplementary Figure S6 ) after knocking down ESRP2 and Arkadia . In OS - RC - 2 cells , ESRP2 mRNA levels decreased after knocking down Arkadia , but this was not observed in HEK293T cells ( Supplementary Figures S5 and S6 ) . Knockdown of ESRP2 and Arkadia promoted cell proliferation in both HEK293T and OS - RC - 2 cells . BrdU incorporation into OS - RC - 2 cells was increased after knocking down ESRP2 and Arkadia , suggesting that ESRP2 and Arkadia decrease cell population at the S phase and regulate cell proliferation . Arkadia may function as an EMT - promoting factor via enhan - cing TGF - β signaling , whereas ESRP2 is an EMT - suppressing factor . 9 , 14 However , many of ccRCC shows mesenchymal phenotypes with low E - cadherin / N - cadherin expression ratios as reported previously 7 ( Supplementary Figure S7a ) , and knockdown of Arkadia failed to show signi ﬁ cant effects on E - and N - cadherin expression in OS - RC - 2 cells ( Supplementary Figures S7b ) . More - over , while knocking down ESRP2 expression promoted transwell cell migration in OS - RC - 2 cells ( see Figure 1e ) , knockdown of Arkadia did not promote transwell cell migration in OS - RC - 2 cells ( Supplementary Figure S8 ) , possibly because of a wide variety of target genes regulated by Arkadia . According to the analysis of ccRCC patient data obtained from TCGA , lower Arkadia expression correlated with advanced cancer stage , but Arkadia was expressed in all ccRCC tumors ( Figure 5h ) , in agreement with the ﬁ ndings that Arkadia suppresses ccRCC tumor proliferation . To determine whether Arkadia functions as a tumor suppressor in ccRCC , we performed a Kaplan – Meier survival analysis using the RNA - seq data and clinical data obtained from TCGA . Although Arkadia mRNA expression did not correlate with ESRP2 mRNA expression ( Supplementary Figure S9 ) , higher expression of Arkadia mRNA correlated with better patient prognosis ( Figure 5i ) . Taken together , these ﬁ ndings suggest that the splicing function of ESRP2 promoted by Arkadia results in tumor suppression and a better outcome for ccRCC patients . DISCUSSION During the process of EMT , the expression of ESRP1 and ESRP2 mRNA is transcriptionally decreased , followed by a switching of the splicing pro ﬁ les from epithelial type to mesenchymal type , and leading to the acquisition of a more malignant phenotype . 9 , 27 ESRP1 has been described as a tumor suppressor in pancreatic cancer , 28 but reported to promote lung metastasis in breast cancer through CD44 splicing . 29 In ccRCC , a major subtype of kidney cancer accounting for 70 – 80 % of all kidney cancer patients , 30 ESRP1 expression is lost ; 7 however , we found in the present study that ESRP2 expression is maintained . Recently , Ishii et al . 22 reported that ESRP1 and 2 suppress cancer cell motility through different mechanisms ; ESRP1 regulates the expression of Rac1b , whereas ESRP2 attenuates cell motility through regulation of cell – cell adhesion . Our results show that the splicing function of ESRP2 is important for prognosis in ccRCC patients . In the present study , we chose three exons as indicators of ESRP2 splicing function among the established ESRP - target exons . Our Kaplan – Meier analyses show that these gene products appear to have bene ﬁ cial effects on the prognosis of ccRCC ( Figures 2b – d ) . However , mechanisms of the bene ﬁ cial effects of these ESRP - target exons remain to be determined . Interestingly , the ENAH isoform with exon 11a might not bind to actin ﬁ ber , which may lead to suppression of the cell motility . 31 , 32 ITGA6 is a cell adhesion molecule , and SLK reportedly acts as an antiproliferative factor in kidney tissue ; 33 thus , alternative splicing may affect the function of these molecules , leading to regulation of the progression of ccRCC . Our present ﬁ ndings demonstrate that ESRP2 is ubiquitinated by Arkadia . Lys27 - linked polyubiquitin may act as translocation signaling , and molecular structures may be stabilized by attach - ment of the Lys27 - linked polyubiquitin chain . 19 , 34 , 35 A point mutation in ESRP2 at the second RRM motif has been reported to alter its ability to bind RNA substrates in breast cancer , 36 suggesting that the second RRM of ESRP2 is involved in binding to RNA substrates . Our ﬁ ndings show that lysine residues within the second and third RRM motifs in ESRP2 are targets of Arkadia and important for the splicing ability of ESRP2 . In agreement with the biochemical data , our analyses of RNA - seq using 2×2 contingency matrixes in OS - RC - 2 and HEK293T cells show the overall picture for the roles of ESRP2 and Arkadia , suggesting that ESRP2 and Arkadia act in a coordinated manner . Our analyses of RNA - seq in OS - RC - 2 cells indicate that ESRP2 and Arkadia are involved in cell proliferation in ccRCC ( Supplementary Tables S1 and S3 ) . The results of preranked gene set enrichment analysis show that several tumor - promotive gene sets , including the Wnt pathway genes , are enriched in genes downregulated by ESRP2 and Arkadia ( Supplementary Table S1 ) . It has been reported that the Wnt signaling has oncogenic roles in RCC . 37 It should also be noted that the gene products used in validation in OS - RC - 2 cells ( Figure 5c ) stimulate cancer cell proliferation through various mechanisms . Neuropillin - 1 binds to vascular endothelial growth factors , and promotes angiogenesis and cell proliferation in various tumors . 38 Recently , it has been reported that GCLM functions as a cancer initiation factor through synthesis of the antioxidant glutathione . 39 HB - EGF binds to the EGF receptors and promotes tumor malignancy in several types of cancers . 40 , 41 The PP2C β and GAS41 complex dephosphorylate and suppress p53 , resulting in increase in cell survival . 42 According to our data , ESRP2 and Arkadia suppress the expression of these genes , and exhibit tumor suppressive roles in ccRCC . Notably , Arkadia - ESRP2 axis suppresses progression of ccRCC A Mizutani et al 3519 © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited Oncogene ( 2016 ) 3514 – 3523 TGF - β decreases the expression of both ESRP2 and Arkadia , although these tumor - suppressive roles of ESRP2 and Arkadia appear to be independent of TGF - β signaling . In contrast to the coordinate function with ESRP2 on cell proliferation , the effects of Arkadia on cell motility and EMT appear to be cell type - and context - dependent .

This might be because Arkadia has many targets with various effects on cell motility . 14 , 19 – 21 Arkadia may induce EMT in certain types of cells through enhancing the function of TGF - β ; however , as ccRCC cells exhibit strong mesenchymal phenotypes , we failed to show signi ﬁ cant effects of Arkadia on the regulation of EMT ( Supplementary Figure S7 ) . Our present study thus revealed that Arkadia may alter the expression of splicing variants that lead to the regulation of cell proliferation through modulation of the function of ESRP2 . Arkadia expression levels correlated with those of ESRP2 - target exons , and they signi ﬁ cantly correlated with better patient outcome . Thus , our ﬁ ndings suggest that Arkadia has a critical role in suppressing the progression of ccRCC by regulating the function of ESRP2 , and that the Arkadia - ESRP2 axis functions as a tumor suppressor in ccRCC .
