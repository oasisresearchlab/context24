MYO2 encodes a type V myosin heavy chain needed for the targeting of vacuoles and secretory vesi - cles to the growing bud of yeast . Here we describe new myo2 alleles containing conditional lethal mutations in the COOH - terminal tail domain . Within 5 min of shift - ing to the restrictive temperature , the polarized distri - bution of secretory vesicles is abolished without affect - ing the distribution of actin or the mutant Myo2p , showing that the tail has a direct role in vesicle target - ing . We also show that the actin cable – dependent trans - location of Myo2p to growth sites does not require secretory vesicle cargo . Although a fusion protein con - taining the Myo2p tail also concentrates at growth sites , this accumulation depends on the polarized delivery of secretory vesicles , implying that the Myo2p tail binds to secretory vesicles . Most of the new mutations alter a region of the Myo2p tail conserved with vertebrate myosin Vs but divergent from Myo4p , the myosin V in - volved in mRNA transport , and genetic data suggest that the tail interacts with Smy1p , a kinesin homologue , and Sec4p , a vesicle - associated Rab protein . The data support a model in which the Myo2p tail tethers secre - tory vesicles , and the motor transports them down po - larized actin cables to the site of exocytosis . Key words : cell polarity • myosin V • MYO2 gene product • exocytosis • Saccharomyces cerevisiae E SSENTIALLY all eukaryotic cells are polarized , from single cell fungi to animal cells in tissues . This po - larity is reflected in polarized microtubule and mi - crofilament cytoskeletons and polarized membrane trans - port ( for reviews see Drubin and Nelson , 1996 ; Keller and Simons , 1997 ) . In animal cells , long - range vesicle transport occurs along microtubules using kinesin motors , and then switches to short - range myosin - driven transport along ac - tin filaments near the final delivery site ( for review see Schliwa , 1999 ) . Similarly , in filamentous fungi , both micro - tubules and actin direct polarized secretion ( for reviews see Heath , 1994 ; Seiler et al . , 1997 ) . In contrast , microtu - bules play no role in polarized secretion in the yeast Sac - charomyces cerevisiae ( Jacobs et al . , 1988 ; Huffaker et al . , 1988 ) . Nevertheless , actin is essential for polarized secretion , which directs growth in yeast , and as a result , cells with de - fective actin cannot bud but instead become enlarged spheres which expand isotropically ( Novick and Botstein , 1985 ) . Accordingly , the actin cytoskeleton consists mainly of cortical actin patches concentrated near regions of growth and cables oriented towards the same regions ( Ad - ams and Pringle , 1984 ) . For example , in small - budded cells , actin patches congregate in the growing bud and ca - bles extend from the mother cell into the bud . Until recently it was uncertain whether cortical patches , actin cables , or both direct secretion . The isolation of the conditional tropomyosin mutant tpm1 - 2 tpm2 (cid:68) has re - solved this issue ( Pruyne et al . , 1998 ) . Upon shifting to the restrictive temperature , tropomyosin - containing actin ca - bles disappear within a minute , followed by the depolar - ization of the secretory vesicle marker Sec4p within the next minute , even though actin patches remain polarized for (cid:46) 15 min . Shifting depolarized cells back to the per - missive temperature restores cables and polarized Sec4p within 1 min and budding within 10 min , although actin patches do not repolarize until 15 min . These results show that actin cables direct secretory vesicle delivery indepen - dently of the actin patch distribution . One protein whose distribution responds rapidly to ac - tin cable disassembly and reassembly is Myo2p ( Pruyne et al . , 1998 ) , a myosin V needed for polarized delivery of secretory vesicles and vacuole membranes ( Johnston et al . , 1991 ; Govindan et al . , 1995 ; Hill et al . , 1996 ; Santos and Snyder , 1997 ; Catlett and Weisman , 1998 ) . Myo2p nor - mally concentrates at the same sites of exocytosis and growth as secretory vesicles and Sec4p ( Lillie and Brown , 1994 ; Walch - Solimena et al . , 1997 ) . Myosin Vs are double - headed myosins with a conserved Address correspondence to Anthony Bretscher , Department of Molecu - lar Biology and Genetics , 351 Biotechnology Building , Cornell University , Ithaca , NY 14853 .

In animal cells , myosin V transports membranes ( for review see Mermall et al . , 1998 ) , leading to a model for membrane transport in which the tail binds to cargo while the motor walks along actin filaments ( see Prekeris and Terrian , 1997 ) . However , some observations do not seem to fit such a simple model for Myo2p . First , the original conditional myo2 allele , myo2 - 66 , causes severe defects in the actin cytoskeleton ( Johnston et al . , 1991 ) , suggesting that Myo2p might polar - ize secretion indirectly through its effect on the cytoskele - ton . Second , the continued partial localization of Myo2p in the apparent absence of actin filaments ( Ayscough et al . , 1997 ) , and recent evidence that the tail may affect the po - larized distribution of Myo2p ( Catlett and Weisman , 1998 ; Reck - Peterson et al . , 1999 ) have been interpreted to mean that it is the tail , not the motor , that directs Myo2p to growth sites . We describe two approaches to investigate the role of the Myo2p tail . First , we made conditional lethal muta - tions in this putative cargo - binding domain , and second , we expressed fusion proteins containing the cargo - binding domain . Both approaches show that the tail’s primary function is to carry secretory cargo . Materials and Methods Temperature - sensitive myo2 Yeast Strains Table I lists the yeast strains and Table II the plasmids used . Sherman ( 1991 ) and Ausubel et al . ( 1996 ) describe the methods used for growth , maintenance , and genetic manipulation of yeast , and Gietz and Schiestl ( 1995 ) describe the method used to transform yeast . Temperature - sensitive myo2 strains were generated by replacing the 3 (cid:57) region of the endogenous genomic MYO2 gene with mutagenized plasmid DNA . To construct a plasmid capable of integrating 3 (cid:57) to MYO2 , pJP10 - 2B ( YCp50 containing MYO2 ) ( Johnston et al . , 1991 ) was cut with SpeI and the resulting fragments circularized using T4 DNA ligase . The ligated DNA served as template for five cycles of amplification by PCR using Taq DNA polymerase and the oligonucleotide primers GATAATGAAATC - GATATTATGGAAGA and CGGGATCCATTATCATACTATAC - TATTGACAAATACTTC . The ClaI - BamHI segment of the 1 . 7 - kb product was inserted into pRS303 ( Sikorski and Hieter , 1989 ) . Destruc - tion of the pRS303 SpeI site by cutting with SpeI ( partial digest ) and XbaI and religation produced the plasmid pRS303MYO2 , containing the 201 - bp ClaI - SpeI fragment of the MYO2 3 (cid:57) untranslated region , followed by the 1 , 587 - bp segment of MYO2 from the SpeI site at (cid:49) 3271 on , fused to the sequence GCACTAGA and the NotI site of pRS303 . pRS303MYO2 served as a template for PCR - based mutagenesis ( Cad - well and Joyce , 1992 ) , modified to reduce the mutation frequency . The re - action mix ( 1 mM dCTP , 1 mM dTTP , 0 . 2 mM dATP , 0 . 2 mM dGTP , 40 ng pRS303MYO2 cut with PvuII , 7 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 5 mM primers , 50 mM KCl , 10 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 3 , 10 mg BSA , and 0 . 05 % Tween 20 ; and after the mix had warmed up to 80 (cid:56) C , 0 . 3 mM MnCl 2 and 5u Taq DNA poly - merase ) was subjected to six cycles of amplification and the EcoRI - NotI fragment of the PCR product was subcloned into the corresponding re - Table I .

When cut with SpeI and transformed into yeast , the library plasmids insert pRS303 ( containing HIS3 ) into the ClaI site of the MYO2 3 (cid:57) untranslated region , and replace the EcoRI - ClaI region of MYO2 with mutagenized sequence encoding amino acid residues 1119 to the COOH terminus . Roughly 500 transformants at 30 (cid:56) C were replica - plated to 14 and 37 (cid:56) C to detect conditional - lethal mutants . Phloxine B included in plates at 10 mg / liter allowed easier identification of growth - arrested yeast ( Horn and Wilkie , 1966 ) . Because dead cells absorb this red dye , red marks corre - spond to the positions of temperature - sensitive colonies . Genomic DNA from each of the temperature sensitives was cut with SpeI and circularized to reconstitute versions of pRS303MYO2 containing mutations . Transfor - mation of these plasmids relinearized with SpeI into the yeast strain PSY316 yielded the temperature - sensitive strains ABY532 , 533 , 534 , 536 , 537 , 538 , and 530 . The temperature sensitivity could be complemented by transformation with pJP10 - 2B ( MYO2 on a low copy number plasmid ) or by mating with a MYO2 strain , but could not be complemented by mating with JP7B , a myo2 - 66 strain . ABY531 , an isogenic MYO2 strain , was made by transformation of PSY316 with pRS303MYO2 . An analogous se - ries of plasmids made from pRS306 ( containing URA3 ) allowed the con - struction of yeast strains containing myo2 alleles tagged with URA3 . To make an isogenic myo2 - 66 strain , genomic DNA from JP7B transformed with pRS303MYO2 was cut with NcoI and religated , resulting in an inte - grating plasmid analogous to pRS303MYO2 , but containing the full - length myo2 - 66 gene instead of the MYO2 fragment . This plasmid was cut with NcoI and transformed into PSY316 to construct ABY535 . Diploid versions of these strains were made by transiently transforming with YCp50HO , a plasmid bearing HO ( Herskowitz and Jensen , 1991 ) . Genetic Interactions of myo2 ts Alleles Genetic interactions of myo2 - 13 with sec1 - 1 , sec2 - 56 , sec5 - 24 , sec6 - 4 , and sec9 - 4 mutations were tested by mating ABY533 with MATa sec ts strains ( MATa strains being generated from MAT (cid:97) by standard genetic meth - ods ) , sporulating , and dissecting tetrads onto synthetic minimal dextrose medium ( SD ) 1 and yeast extract peptone - dextrose medium ( YPD ) at 30 (cid:56) C . Crosses producing a high frequency of tetrads with four viable spores are considered not to show synthetic lethality . P (cid:44) 0 . 05 in all cases reported and P (cid:44) 0 . 0005 in most cases , based on a binomial distribution , assuming meiotic gene conversion does not exceed 20 % . Nonsynthetic le - thals were confirmed by testing temperature sensitivity to show that some viable spores are likely to be myo2 - 13 sec ts double mutants . We suspected that myo2 - 13 is synthetically lethal with sec4 - 8 but could not prove it by the method described above , because even MYO2 (cid:49) strains have low spore viability when crossed with the sec4 - 8 strain NY405 . Therefore , we deter - mined synthetic lethality of sec4 - 8 with myo2 ts mutations by constructing sec4 - 8 myo2 ts strains bearing pJP10 - 2B , a CEN plasmid containing MYO2 and URA3 . Strains with synthetic lethal combinations are unable to grow at 22 (cid:56) C on minimal medium containing 5 - fluoro - orotic acid , which selects against URA3 . To determine synthetic growth defects of nonlethal combi - nations , restrictive temperatures with and without pJP10 - 2B were com - pared . At least three different strains from the sec4 - 8 (cid:51) myo2 ts cross were tested for each combination of alleles and conditions . To screen for overexpression suppressors of myo2 ts , myo2 - 17 , myo2 - 18 , and myo2 - 20 strains were transformed with a multicopy ( 2 (cid:109) ) genomic li - brary in YEp351 ( Engebrecht et al . , 1990 ) , and 287 , 000 colonies replica - plated onto rich media at 37 (cid:56) C . SMY1 was isolated from one clone by sub - cloning the PstI - StuI fragment of the insert into PstI - SmaI of YEp351 . YEpSMY1 , the resulting plasmid , contains the SMY1 open reading frame flanked by the 5 (cid:57) 651 bp and 3 (cid:57) 266 bp of untranslated sequence . Fluorescence Microscopy To produce anti - Myo2p antibodies , the NsiI - EcoRI fragment of pJP10 - 2B , encoding amino acid residues 784 – 1118 of Myo2p ( encompassing the IQ repeat and coiled – coil domains ) , was subcloned into pRG32D ( Gary and Bretscher , 1995 ) and the glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) – Myo2p fu - sion protein was purified as described ( Smith and Johnson , 1988 ) ( Amer - sham Pharmacia Biotech ) . Rabbit antisera against the fusion protein were affinity - purified using fusion protein coupled to activated CH - Sepharose 4B ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) . To block antiyeast antibodies in the rabbit anti - LexAp antiserum ( Sassanfar and Roberts , 1990 ) , the antise - rum was mixed with an equal volume of yeast , fixed , zymolyase digested , methanol / acetone extracted as for immunofluorescence ( Pringle et al . , 1991 ) , gently mixed overnight at 6 (cid:56) C , and centrifuged to remove cells and debris . Immunofluorescence was performed as described ( Pruyne et al . , 1998 ) using 1 : 50 anti - Myo2p and 1 : 100 anti - LexAp . To measure the pro - portion of cells containing polarized Sec4p and Myo2p , we identified a random small - budded cell by differential interference contrast ( DIC ) , switched to viewing by fluorescence to score whether the bud or bud tip is brighter than the mother cell , then switched back to DIC and moved to a new field , repeating until we had scored 200 , or in some experiments , 100 cells . For experiments where small - budded cells become scarce ( 75 - min temperature shift of myo2 ts mutants or expression of LexA fusion protein ) we counted all cells regardless of the cell cycle stage . Calcofluor staining ( Pringle , 1991 ) , vacuole inheritance ( Hill et al . , 1996 ) , and endocytosis of the water - soluble dye Lucifer yellow ( Dulic et al . , 1991 ) were observed by the methods described . As negative controls , we tested DBY2000 ( act1 - 1 ) and NY405 ( sec4 - 8 ) for endocytosis : (cid:122) 10 and 1 % , respectively , take up Lucifer yellow at 37 (cid:56) C , compared with 50 – 75 % of wild - type and myo2 ts cells . Inducible Expression of Myo2p Fusion Proteins in Yeast To express high levels of a GST fusion protein containing the Myo2p COOH - terminal region , pEGM was constructed by subcloning the EcoRI - ClaI fragment of pJP10 - 2B into pRS303 , and then inserting the BglII - SalI fragment of the resulting plasmid into the BamHI and SalI sites of pEG , a 2 (cid:109) plasmid with GST under GAL control ( pEG [ KG ] ) ( Mitchell 1 .

A CEN plasmid , pCGM , was made by replacing the smaller NcoI - SalI fragment of pRS316 ( Sikorski and Hieter , 1989 ) with the smaller NcoI - SalI fragment of pEGM . Similarly , pCG was made by re - placing the smaller NcoI - XbaI fragment of pRS316 with the smaller NcoI - XbaI fragment of pEG . pCLM was made by replacing the SacI - NruI frag - ment of pCGM encoding GST with a PCR product encoding LexA protein plus one COOH - terminal glycine . This construct contains three si - lent mutations in LexA . pCL was constructed by cutting pCLM with ClaI , filling in the 5 (cid:57) overhang , cutting with NruI , and recircularizing , thereby removing the entire MYO2 sequence . Western blotting for GST and LexAp confirmed inducible expression of fusion proteins . Sequence Analysis A PSI - BLAST ( Altschul et al . , 1997 ) search for sequences significantly sim - ilar to the Myo2p tail identified 16 plant , 7 animal , 1 Dictyostelium , and 3 fungal myosin Vs ( not including Myo2p ) . All have a conserved NH 2 - termi - nal motor domain , six IQ repeats , a predicted coiled – coil region ( COILS2 ) ( Lupas , 1996 ) , and the conserved tail domain ( Table III ) , except for the mouse myosin Vb sequence , which is incomplete . Searching for sequences similar to the Myo4p tail failed to find additional myosins . Some authors ( for example , Mooseker and Cheney , 1995 ) have grouped the plant and Dictyostelium myosins as a separate class , myosin XI . For the sake of clarity we call all of these myosins “myosin V , ” since they clearly form a distinct group with a common origin and since all of the experimentally character - ized myosins of this group are called myosin V in the literature . We used a parsimony method to determine the relationship among Myo2p , Myo4p , and Schizosaccharomyces pombe myosin V , using Dictyo - stelium myosin II as an outgroup . The three myosin V motor domains were independently aligned with myosin II , identifying 29 informative po - sitions ( where one residue occurs in two myosins and a different residue occurs in both of the other two myosins ) in unambiguously aligned re - gions . These positions are widely dispersed in the motor domain structure and are spaced at least five residues apart . CLUSTAL W ( Thompson et al . , 1994 ) provided an initial multiple alignment of amino acid sequences that was manually corrected by com - paring with the outputs of BLAST and MEME ( Bailey and Elkan , 1994 ) to find obvious alignment errors . Other Methods Western blotting and chemiluminescent protein detection was performed using a 1 : 2 , 000 dilution of affinity - purified anti - Myo2p antibody overnight at 6 (cid:56) C .

The Myo2p Tail Polarizes Secretion 795 Results New Temperature - sensitive COOH - Terminal Domain myo2 Mutations Much of the current knowledge about MYO2 function comes from studies of the original myo2 allele , myo2 - 66 ( Johnston et al . , 1991 ) , a mutation in the NH 2 - terminal motor domain ( Lillie and Brown , 1994 ) . To investigate the COOH - terminal domain’s function , we introduced ran - dom mutations into the chromosomal MYO2 gene ( Fig . 1 ) and screened for heat - and cold - sensitive mutants . We found seven new heat - sensitive alleles of myo2 ( Table IV ) but no cold - sensitives . Temperature sensitivity is recessive in all myo2 ts tail mutants and none are complemented by Figure 1 .

All seven tail mutants have doubling times within (cid:54) 15 % of wild - type ( 95 % confidence interval for each allele ) in synthetic minimal medium ( SD ) at 24 (cid:56) C , showing that all are highly functional at the permissive temperature . However , the growth rate of myo2 - 12 yeast at 24 (cid:56) C is slowed if wild - type MYO2 is introduced on a low - copy number plasmid , indicating a partial gain - of - function ef - fect of this allele at permissive temperatures . The myo2 - 12 mutation appears to make more drastic amino acid changes in Myo2p than any other myo2 ts tail mutation , re - placing a polar residue and a charged residue , both con - served in nearly all myosin Vs , with hydrophobic residues ( Table IV ) . A phenotype common to myo2 - 66 and most of the new myo2 ts alleles is sensitivity to rich media : rich media cause a 1 – 3 (cid:56) C reduction of the restrictive temperature ( Table V ) in all alleles except myo2 - 14 . In addition , myo2 - 12 and myo2 - 16 mutants have slowed growth in rich media even at 24 (cid:56) C . The reason for this rich medium sensitivity is un - clear ; addition of filter - sterilized peptone ( 2 % ) strongly inhibits growth of myo2 - 12 yeast ( the most YPD - sensitive mutant ) in SD , accounting for most of the inhibitory effect of rich media , whereas reduction of the glucose concentra - tion partially restores growth to myo2 - 12 yeast in YPD . Addition of 1 M sorbitol to provide osmotic support has no effect on myo2 - 12 mutant growth in YPD . Genetic Interactions of the New myo2 ts Alleles To identify components that interact with the Myo2p tail , we screened for genes whose overexpression suppress myo2 - 17 , myo2 - 18 , or myo2 - 20 temperature sensitivity . Our screen identified one clone of SMY1 , a gene recov - ered previously as a multicopy suppressor of myo2 - 66 ( Lillie and Brown , 1992 ) . Multicopy SMY1 ( YEpSMY1 ) dramatically suppresses myo2 - 12 , myo2 - 13 , myo2 - 16 , myo2 - 17 , and myo2 - 18 temperature sensitivity and moder - ately suppresses myo2 - 20 . Intriguingly , suppression of myo2 - 66 in an isogenic strain is weaker than for the alleles mentioned above , and multicopy SMY1 does not suppress myo2 - 14 at all ( Table V and data not shown ) . The original myo2 - 66 mutation is lethal in combination ( synthetically lethal ) with mutations in a broad spectrum of other genes , including a subset of genes affecting post - Golgi steps in secretion ( Govindan et al . , 1995 ) . Since we are interested in the role of Myo2p in the polarized deliv - ery of secretory vesicles , we wished to examine whether a myo2 ts tail mutation shows synthetic lethality with these mutations as well . We chose myo2 - 13 because it is neither one of the most nor one of the least severe temperature - sensitive alleles we isolated . myo2 - 13 is not synthetically lethal at 30 (cid:56) C on SD or YPD with sec1 - 1 , sec2 - 56 , sec5 - 24 , sec6 - 4 , or sec9 - 4 . In contrast , sec2 - 41 , sec5 - 24 , and sec9 - 4 have been reported to be synthetically lethal with myo2 - 66 at 25 (cid:56) C ( Govindan et al . , 1995 ) . We also checked for synthetic lethality of all the new myo2 ts alleles with sec4 - 8 . Like myo2 - 66 ( Govindan et al . , 1995 ) , myo2 - 14 is synthetically lethal with sec4 - 8 , whereas myo2 - 12 , myo2 - 13 , myo2 - 16 , myo2 - 17 , and myo2 - 18 have only mild synthetic growth defects with sec4 - 8 ( Table V ) . Interestingly , myo2 - 20 shows no synthetic growth defect at all with sec4 - 8 . Targeting of Secretory Vesicles to Growth Sites Requires the Myo2p Tail Like myo2 - 66 ( Johnston et al . , 1991 ) , the new myo2 ts tail mutations block bud initiation and polarized growth at the restrictive temperature , with most of the cells arresting as very large , unbudded spheres ( Table IV ) , indicating a block in polarized secretion even though secreted proteins still reach the cell surface . Furthermore , like myo2 - 66 yeast , the new temperature - sensitive tail mutants deposit chitin diffusely over the cell surface at 37 (cid:56) C in SD ( Table IV ) . In myo2 - 66 yeast , this diffuse chitin distribution is due to a failure to target a membrane protein , the main chitin synthetase Chs3p , to the correct locations ( Santos and Snyder , 1997 ) . To investigate whether loss of polarized secretion is a di - rect result of loss of Myo2p function , we looked at how rapidly the polarized distribution of Sec4p , a Rab GTPase component of late secretory vesicles ( Mulholland et al . , 1997 ; Walch - Solimena et al . , 1997 ) , disappears in myo2 ts mutants after shift to the restrictive temperature . In wild - type yeast , shifting to temperature above 35°C depolarizes actin , Myo2p , and Sec4p , which then return more than an hour later ( Lillie and Brown , 1994 ) . The polarized Sec4p Table V .

The Myo2p Tail Polarizes Secretion 797 distribution fails to return in myo2 - 66 ( Lillie and Brown , 1994 ) and myo2 tail mutants ( Table VI ) . To see the immediate effects of disrupting Myo2p func - tion , we chose to look at myo2 - 16 and myo2 - 66 because their restrictive temperatures are low enough that shifting to these temperatures leaves the distribution of Myo2p , Sec4p , and the actin cytoskeleton relatively unaffected in wild - type yeast ( Pruyne et al . , 1998 ) . In myo2 - 16 yeast , the Sec4p distribution begins to depolarize within 1 min of temperature shift and is completely depolarized within 5 min ( Fig . 2 A ) . In earlier studies , Walch - Solimena et al . ( 1997 ) showed that myo2 - 66 blocks accumulation of Sec4p at growth sites after 1 h at 37 (cid:56) C , and Govindan et al . ( 1995 ) showed that myo2 - 66 blocks the accumulation of secretory vesicles in small buds . Here we show that myo2 - 66 yeast has a partially polarized distribution of Sec4p at 25 (cid:56) C that disappears very rapidly upon shift to a restrictive temperature ( Fig . 2 A ) . The redistribution of Sec4p is complete within a 1 - min shift to 30 . 5 (cid:56) C ( data not shown ) . We conclude that the loss of Myo2p head or tail function depolarizes Sec4p , and presumably secretory vesicle tar - geting in (cid:44) 5 min . Targeting of Myo2p to Growth Sites Requires a Functional Actin - binding Domain but Not a Functional COOH - Terminal Domain Shifting myo2 - 16 yeast to 35 (cid:56) C for 5 min , conditions that completely depolarize Sec4p , has no effect on the Table VI .

MYO2 wild - type yeast shows a slight depolarization of Myo2p upon shift to 35 (cid:56) C , such that Myo2 - 16p retains slightly greater polarity than wild - type Myo2p . Myo2 - 12p , another tail mutant , also re - mains polarized despite a depolarized Sec4p distribution ( Fig . 2 D ) . Furthermore , Myo2 - 17p , Myo2 - 18p , and Myo2 - 20p are at least as polarized as wild - type Myo2p at 37 (cid:56) C ( Table VI ) . In contrast to Myo2 - 16p , the polarized distribution of Myo2 - 66p disappears very rapidly ( within 5 min of shifting to 35 (cid:56) C ) ( Fig . 2 B ) , even though Myo2 - 66p is still present ( Fig . 2 C ) . As is the case with Sec4p , the redistribution of Myo2 - 66p is nearly complete within 1 min shift to 30 . 5 (cid:56) C ( data not shown ) , and even at the permissive temperature there is a substantial defect in Myo2 - 66p polarization ( Fig . 2 B ) . To test whether this polarized distribution of Myo2 - 16p reflects continued cable - dependent transport or simple trapping of the myosin at growth sites , the behavior of the tail mutant was examined in a background conditionally defective for cables ( Pruyne et al . , 1998 ) . tpm1 - 2 tpm2 (cid:68) myo2 - 16 cells shifted to 34 . 5 (cid:56) C lose cables as well as the polarized distribution of Myo2 - 16p ( Fig . 3 ) . When re - stored to a permissive temperature , cables reform and the mutant myosin repolarizes within 2 min , just as seen for wild - type myosin ( MYO2 (cid:49) tpm1 - 2 tpm2 (cid:68) yeast ) ( Fig . 3 and Pruyne et al . , 1998 ) . Notably , Myo2 - 16p repolarizes despite the lack of Sec4p - associated cargo ( Fig . 3 ) . Again , a slightly greater proportion of myo2 - 16 than MYO2 (cid:49) cells show a polarized Myo2p distribution . The Myo2p Tail Is Not Directly Needed for Actin Cytoskeleton Polarity myo2 - 16 has very little effect on the overall appearance of the actin cytoskeleton at 35 (cid:56) C . As seen by immunofluo - rescence , actin cables are as abundant as in wild - type yeast and remain aligned towards presumptive regions of growth ( Fig . 4 A ) even after prolonged incubation ( 1 . 5 h ) at the restrictive temperature . Actin patches remain polar - ized at early timepoints ( Fig . 4 A ) and then slowly redis - tribute to an even distribution over the entire surface of the cell . Substantial depolarization of actin patches re - quires (cid:122) 15 min of temperature shift and complete depo - larization requires (cid:46) 30 min . At their restrictive tempera - tures , the other myo2 ts tail mutants show a similar actin distribution to myo2 - 16 , except for myo2 - 12 after pro - longed incubation at a restrictive temperature , where a small proportion ( (cid:35) 1 % ) of cells contain actin bars similar to those seen in myo2 - 66 cells ( Johnston et al . , 1991 ) . The bars presumably represent aberrant aggregates of unpo - lymerized actin , because antiactin antibody detects the bars whereas rhodamine - phalloidin , which binds actin fila - ments , does not . The actin distribution in myo2 - 66 yeast ( Fig . 4 A ) is re - markably similar to wild - type and myo2 - 16 , except that even at the permissive temperature myo2 - 66 yeast has subtle defects in the actin patch distribution . These results are consistent with the finding that functional Myo2p is unnecessary for the rapid assembly of actin cables ( Pruyne et al . 1998 ) . Actin bars are much less abundant ( (cid:35) 1 % of Figure 3 . Myo2p and Sec4p distributions in tpm1 - 2 tpm2 (cid:68) MYO2 (cid:49) ( ABY988 ) and tpm1 - 2 tpm2 (cid:68) myo2 - 16 ( ABY1128 ) yeast grown at 25 (cid:56) C ( upper panels ) , shifted to 34 . 5 (cid:56) C for 10 min ( middle panels ) , and then shifted back to 25 (cid:56) C for 2 min ( lower pan - els ) . Percentages of small - budded cells showing a polar - ized distribution are shown . on A p r il 4 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published November 15 , 1999 Schott et al . The Myo2p Tail Polarizes Secretion 799 cells ) than reported by Johnston et al . ( 1991 ) , a discrep - ancy probably accounted for by a difference in strain back - ground and growth conditions . If Myo2p moves along actin cables , it might partially colocalize with them . Indeed , in myo2 tail mutants shifted for a long time to 37 (cid:56) C such that actin patches no longer obscure cables at polarized sites , the mutant Myo2p is concentrated at the point where cables converge ( Fig . 4 B ) . Furthermore , Myo2p staining in wild - type yeast sometimes reveals faint cable - like structures and rows of Myo2p patches along actin cables ( Fig . 4 C ) . This colocal - ization is not due to bleed - through between fluorescence channels , because the bright actin patches are not gener - ally visible in the Myo2p images and the bright patch of Myo2p at the bud tip is not seen in the F - actin images ( Fig . 4 C ) . The myo2 ts Tail Mutations Have Little Effect on Vacuole Inheritance at Permissive Temperatures or Bulk Secretion and Endocytosis at Restrictive Temperatures In addition to its role in polarized secretion , MYO2 is also needed for polarized transport of the vacuole into the bud ( Hill et al . , 1996 ) , and even at a permissive temperature , myo2 - 66 blocks transfer of any part of the vacuole from the mother cell to the growing bud ( Hill et al . , 1996 ; this study ) ( Table IV ) . In addition , a screen for mutants defec - tive in vacuole inheritance identified myo2 - 2 ( Catlett and Weisman , 1998 ) , a Myo2p tail point mutation that does not dramatically affect polarized secretion ( Catlett and Weisman , 1998 ) . In contrast , none of the new myo2 ts mu - tants have any vacuole inheritance defect at 24 (cid:56) C ( Table IV ) . Even at 34 (cid:56) C , a semipermissive temperature , 51 % of myo2 - 17 cells , 75 % of myo2 - 18 cells , and 64 % of myo2 - 20 cells show transfer of vacuole membrane to the bud , dem - onstrating only a partial defect ( 95 % of wild - type cells transfer vacuoles to the bud ) . A conditional mutant of actin shows a partial defect in invertase secretion ( Novick and Botstein , 1985 ) , but nei - ther myo2 - 66 ( Johnston et al . , 1991 ) nor the new myo2 tail mutations shows a detectable defect in invertase secretion at the restrictive temperature ( data not shown ) , showing that the myo2 mutations disrupt polarized secretion with - out affecting fusion of invertase - containing secretory vesi - cles with the plasma membrane .

Endocytosis requires many of the known components of the actin cytoskeleton ( for review see Mulholland et al . , 1999 ) , but does not require a functional Myo2p motor do - main ( Govindan et al . , 1995 ) . After 20 min at 37 (cid:56) C , none of the new myo2 ts alleles affect endocytosis , assayed by up - take of Lucifer yellow , indicating that the Myo2p tail , like the motor , is dispensable for endocytosis . Fusion Proteins Containing the Myo2p Tail Disrupt MYO2’s Essential Function We expressed fusion proteins containing the Myo2p COOH - terminal domain to see whether this domain would interfere with polarized delivery of secretory vesi - cles by competing with endogenous Myo2p . Expression of GST fused at the COOH terminus with residues 1131 – 1574 of Myo2p ( Fig . 1 ) from a galactose - inducible pro - moter on either a multicopy plasmid ( pEGM ) ( Fig . 5 A ) or low - copy number plasmid ( pCGM ) completely blocks growth . Galactose concentrations of 0 . 02 and 0 . 08 % are sufficient to block growth of cells bearing pEGM and pCGM , respectively , but expression of GST alone from ei - ther a high - copy ( pEG ) or low - copy ( pCG ) plasmid has no effect on growth at 2 % galactose . At high galactose concentrations ( (cid:36) 1 % ) (cid:46) 50 % of the cells with pEGM or pCGM are lysed by 6 h of induction , but at lower concentrations ( (cid:35) 0 . 1 % ) , cells with pEGM be - come spherical , very large , and mostly unbudded , like myo2 ts mutants . Also , like myo2 - 66 yeast that has been shifted to the restrictive temperature for a long time ( Johnston et al . , 1991 ) , a population of very tiny cells is also present , and presumably represent buds that have separated from the mother cell without growing to a nor - mal size . Cells with pEGM and induced with 2 % galactose show a normal polarized Sec4p distribution except at late timepoints , after 8 h in galactose , when most of the cells become inviable . 8 h is also the amount of time needed for full induction from the GAL promoter in the strains we use . To confirm that the tail fusion protein is interfering with normal MYO2 function rather than interfering with an un - natural target , we tested whether myo2 mutants are hyper - sensitive to GST – Myo2p tail fusion protein by transform - ing isogenic MYO2 (cid:49) and myo2 ts strains with pEG and pEGM and testing growth on raffinose plates in the pres - ence or absence of leucine . pEG and pEGM contain a par - tially defective LEU2 allele , leu2d , which selects for two - to fourfold higher plasmid copy number in the absence of leucine than in the presence of leucine ( Erhart and Hol - lenberg , 1983 ; Futcher and Cox , 1984 ) , such that in the ab - sence of leucine there is some expression from the GAL promoter despite the lack of galactose . Under these condi - tions , MYO2 (cid:49) yeast is unaffected by GST – Myo2p tail , but myo2 - 12 , myo2 - 14 , myo2 - 16 , and myo2 - 20 yeast grow poorly and become spherical and very large . Growth of myo2 - 13 and myo2 - 18 yeast is moderately slowed , whereas myo2 - 17 yeast is only slightly affected ( Fig . 5 B ) . We were unable to test myo2 - 66 yeast because myo2 - 66 , unlike the other myo2 alleles , causes very poor growth at any tem - perature when raffinose is the sole carbon source , and we were unable to construct myo2 - 66 strains capable of grow - ing on nonfermentable media . Myo2p Tail Fusion Protein Is Concentrated at Growth Sites by Myo2p - targeted Secretory Vesicles To see the subcellular distribution of Myo2p tail fusion protein , we tagged residues 1147 – 1574 of Myo2p with LexAp , a bacterial protein ( Fig . 1 ) . Expression of LexA – Myo2p tail fusion protein from a GAL promoter on a low - copy number plasmid ( pCLM ) is lethal ( Fig . 5 A ) . Im - munofluorescence shows that 1 – 2 h after addition of 2 % galactose , 10 – 40 % of cells ( depending on strain background ) Figure 5 . ( A ) Expression of Myo2p tail fusion protein is lethal . Three transformants each of ABY531 with pEG ( GSTp ) , pEGM ( GST – Myo2p tail ) , pCL ( LexAp ) , or pCLM ( LexA – Myo2p tail ) were streaked onto raffinose or raffinose plus 0 . 2 or 2 % galac - tose . ( B ) myo2 tail mutants are hypersensitive to expression of tail fusion protein . ABY531 ( MYO2 ) , ABY532 ( myo2 - 12 ) , ABY533 ( myo2 - 13 ) , ABY534 ( myo2 - 14 ) , ABY536 ( myo2 - 16 ) , ABY537 ( myo2 - 17 ) , ABY538 ( myo2 - 18 ) , and ABY530 ( myo2 - 20 ) bearing pEGM ( GST – Myo2p tail ) or pEG ( GSTp ) were streaked onto raffinose medium containing or lacking leucine and incubated at 30 (cid:56) C . Media lacking leucine select for cells with high plasmid copy number . Results are identical for at least four independent transformants for each combination of strain and plasmid . on A p r il 4 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published November 15 , 1999 Schott et al . The Myo2p Tail Polarizes Secretion 801 transformed with pCLM show a polarized distribution of LexAp similar to the polarized distribution of Sec4p and Myo2p ( Fig . 6 ) . Sec4p and the endogenous Myo2p distri - bution ( using an antibody raised to a region outside the tail ) is normal in these cells . With longer induction times ( (cid:46) 4 h in galactose ) the distribution of LexA – Myo2p tail in cells bearing pCLM becomes depolarized . Some of the larger - budded cells ( 1 – 9 % at 1 – 2 h induction , rising to 20 % at 4 h ) show depolarized LexA – Myo2p tail and bright lumps of staining near the bud neck . Cells express - ing LexAp alone ( bearing pCL ) show diffuse cytoplasmic staining , with a small proportion of cells that also show bright lumps of staining randomly distributed in the cell ( data not shown ) . The clumping seen in both these cases might represent aggregation in those cells that express high levels of protein , since LexAp multimerizes at high concentrations ( Schnarr et al . , 1985 ) , but notably , only the Myo2p tail fusion protein polarizes within the cell . To test whether this polarized distribution of LexA – Myo2p tail fusion protein depends on polarized targeting of secretory vesicles , we looked at the distribution of LexA – Myo2p tail fusion protein in a myo2 - 16 mutant . Af - ter 5 min shift to 34 . 5 (cid:56) C , myo2 - 16 yeast shows a greatly re - duced number of cells with polarized LexA – Myo2p tail protein compared with MYO2 (cid:49) yeast ( Fig . 6 ) . The distri - bution of endogenous Myo2 - 16p is normal in the myo2 - 16 cells . These results indicate that the polarized distribution of the Myo2p tail fusion protein requires an endogenous Myo2p motor protein with a functional tail domain . This could be because either the tail fusion protein binds di - rectly to full - length Myo2p and this site is defective in myo2 - 16 , or the tail fusion protein binds to secretory vesi - cles normally transported by full - length Myo2p . To dis - tinguish between these two possibilities , we examined whether the fusion protein becomes depolarized in a sec2 - 41 mutant . Walch - Solimena et al . ( 1997 ) have shown that Sec4p becomes depolarized in sec2 cells after 10 - min shift to 37 (cid:56) C , indicating that polarized delivery of secretory ves - icles requires Sec2p , the nucleotide exchange factor for Sec4p . The polarized distribution of LexA – Myo2p tail is reduced in sec2 - 41 yeast after 5 - min shift to 35 (cid:56) C ( Fig . 7 , A and B ) . The polarized distribution of Sec4p also disap - pears , showing that secretion is no longer polarized . How - ever , the distribution of endogenous full - length Myo2p is normal in the sec2 - 41 cells , showing that the mechanism whereby sec2 - 41 disrupts Sec4p and LexA – Myo2p tail tar - geting does not involve disrupting the targeting of full - length Myo2p . In contrast , sec1 - 1 , which blocks vesicle fu - sion but not targeting , increases the frequency of polarized LexA – Myo2p tail distribution upon temperature shift ( Fig . 7 , A and B ) . The Myo2p and Myo4p Tail Sequences Reflect Their Divergent Functions The two myosin V genes of yeast , MYO2 , required for po - larized membrane transport , and MYO4 , required for po - larized mRNA targeting ( Long et al . , 1997 ; Takizawa et al . , 1997 ) , afford an opportunity to find protein sequences specifically involved in membrane binding . Saccharomyces has undergone a genome duplication sometime after it di - verged from another Ascomycete , Kluyveromyces ( Wolfe and Shields , 1997 ) , and MYO2 and MYO4 lie in an unam - biguously duplicated region ( Fig . 8 A ) ( Parle - McDermott et al . , 1996 ; Pearson et al . , 1996 ; Storms et al . , 1997 ) . In support of a recent duplication , the Myo2p and Myo4p tails are more similar to each other than to any other myo - sin V . Furthermore , phylogenetic analysis of motor do - main sequences ( Fig . 8 B ) shows that Myo2p and Myo4p diverged from each other after they diverged from a Schizosaccharomyces pombe myosin V , the most similar known protein to Myo2p and Myo4p . Despite this evidence for a relatively recent origin of two different myosin Vs in yeast , animal myosin Vs are much more similar to Myo2p than to Myo4p in the COOH - terminal half of the tail . Fig . 8 C shows the two ex - tensive regions that can be unambiguously aligned among animal myosin V tails and both Myo2p and Myo4p ( matches highlighted in blue ) . Chicken p190 , a biochemi - cally well - characterized myosin V ( Cheney et al . , 1993 ) , is shown as an example of an animal myosin V . Strikingly , in Figure 6 . The polarized distribution of LexA – Myo2p tail re - quires functional endogenous MYO2 .

For each condition , 200 random cells in four separate trials were scored for staining concentrated at presumptive growth sites . After shift to 34 . 5 (cid:56) C , myo2 - 16 cells are less often polarized for LexAp staining than wild - type ( P (cid:35) 0 . 05 , two - tailed t test ) . on A p r il 4 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published November 15 , 1999 The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 147 , 1999 802 both regions animal myosin Vs are much more similar to Myo2p than to Myo4p ( Fig . 8 C , red boxes ) . Plant myosin Vs ( also known as myosin XIs ) show less similarity to yeast myosin Vs , but nevertheless tend to be more similar to Myo2p than to Myo4p in this region ( Table III and Fig . 8 C , green boxes ) . Since the animal myosin Vs are known to transport membranes ( Mermall et al . , 1998 ) , the sim - plest interpretation is that the distal half of the Myo4p tail has lost features involved in membrane transport which are conserved in Myo2p and animal myosin Vs . Notably , most of the myo2 ts tail mutations make at least one non - conservative change in this region , and changes in the more distal regions correlate with sec4 - 8 synthetic growth defects ( Fig . 8 D ) . Discussion Since the original description of the myo2 - 66 mutation’s effect on polarized secretion ( Johnston et al . , 1991 ) , Myo2p’s precise role has been elusive . Models for Myo2p function have proposed that the motor transports secre - tory vesicles tethered to the COOH - terminal globular do - main down tropomyosin - containing actin cables to their site of exocytosis ( Johnston et al . , 1991 ; Pruyne et al . , 1998 ) , or alternatively , that the COOH - terminal domain binds the plasma membrane at polarized sites , which indi - rectly leads to targeting of secretory vesicles to growth sites ( Reck - Peterson et al . , 1999 ) , possibly by polarizing the actin cytoskeleton ( Lillie and Brown , 1998 ) . To distin - guish between these models and to shed more light on the role of Myo2p , we have characterized new conditional al - leles of myo2 with defects in the COOH - terminal domain . Our results provide strong support for a model in which Myo2p binds secretory vesicles through its COOH - termi - nal domain and transports them down actin cables to re - gions of cell growth . The Myo2p COOH - Terminal Globular Domain Carries Vesicular Cargo We show that polarized secretion requires a functional Myo2p COOH - terminal globular domain : the tail mutants show depolarized growth , isotropic chitin deposition and loss of bud emergence , like the original motor mutant . These results are the first to directly implicate the Myo2p tail in polarized delivery of secretory vesicles . Loss of the secretory vesicle component Sec4p from po - larized sites occurs within 5 min of shifting the tail mutant myo2 - 16 to the restrictive temperature . By contrast , both Myo2 - 16p and the actin cytoskeleton remain polarized for Figure 7 . The polarized dis - tribution of LexA – Myo2p tail requires functional SEC2 .

The Myo2p Tail Polarizes Secretion 803 (cid:46) 15 min , demonstrating that the redistribution of Sec4p in myo2 - 16 mutants is not due to Myo2p mistargeting or actin cytoskeleton depolarization . Since the Sec4p and Myo2p distributions are normally identical but tempera - ture - shifting myo2 - 16 yeast disrupts only the Sec4p distri - bution , the simplest interpretation is that the tail tethers vesicles to Myo2p . Additional evidence that the tail binds secretory vesicle cargo comes from yeast expressing fusion proteins con - taining the Myo2p tail . Isotropic growth and loss of bud emergence , the same phenotypes as myo2 ts mutants , com - bined with the hypersensitivity of myo2 tail mutants to tail fusion protein , show that tail fusion proteins disrupt Myo2p’s normal function in polarized secretion . These fu - sion proteins presumably compete with the endogenous Myo2p tail for a factor in limited supply , such as a receptor for Myo2p on secretory vesicles . Accordingly , fusion pro - tein initially concentrates at the same polarized sites as Myo2p and Sec4p . As we describe below , this initial distri - bution probably represents fusion protein bound to secre - tory vesicles , which are carried by endogenous Myo2p to growth sites , before fusion protein expression reaches sat - urating levels . While this study was in the final stages of assembly , Reck - Peterson et al . ( 1999 ) reported a similar approach with an epitope - tagged Myo2p tail construct that , like our constructs , lethally disrupts polarized secretion and ini - tially concentrates at polarized sites . Although Reck - Peterson et al . ( 1999 ) concluded that the Myo2p tail local - izes independently of the rest of the molecule , we found no evidence to support that conclusion . Instead , we found that the polarized distribution of tail fusion protein de - pends on functional full - length Myo2p , as demonstrated in a myo2 - 16 mutant shifted to the restrictive temperature . More specifically , polarized secretion is essential for a polarized tail fusion protein distribution . The sec2 - 41 mu - tation disrupts the targeting of secretory vesicles to growth sites ( Walch - Solimena et al . , 1997 ) . Shifting sec2 - 41 yeast Figure 8 .

Further - more , since sec1 - 1 blocks vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane but not vesicle targeting , resulting in an initial hyperaccumulation of vesicles at growth sites ( Govindan et al . , 1995 ; Walch - Solimena et al . , 1997 ) , the increased frequency of polarized tail fusion protein in sec1 - 1 yeast shifted to the restrictive temperature also suggests that the tail fusion protein resides on secretory vesicles . Catlett and Weisman ( 1998 ) recently proposed direct binding of the vacuole to the Myo2p tail and describe myo2 - 2 , a tail mutant that blocks vacuole transport with relatively little effect on polarized growth , in contrast to the tail mutant myo2 - 12 described here , which has no ef - fect on vacuole transport at a temperature where the Sec4p distribution is highly defective ( Fig . 2 D ) and growth is sensitive to rich media . For comparison , myo2 - 66 completely blocks vacuole inheritance at permissive temperatures . These combinations of phenotypes are diffi - cult to reconcile with simple models that do not involve binding of the tail to specific cargo membranes . In light of Myo2p’s role in secretory vesicle transport , the rich medium sensitivity of myo2 mutants might be re - lated to the rich medium sensitivity reported for sec3 ( Haarer et al . , 1996 ) and snc1 (cid:68) snc2 (cid:68) mutants ( Proto - popov et al . , 1993 ) . SEC3 and the two SNC synaptobrevin genes are needed for efficient fusion of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane ( Novick et al . , 1980 ; Proto - popov et al . , 1993 ) , but are not absolutely essential . Since nutrient compositions that speed the growth of wild - type yeast slow the growth of most myo2 ts mutants , it is plausi - ble that the increased production of secretory vesicles in rich media exceeds the mutant Myo2p’s capacity to trans - port vesicles , leading to vesicle fusion at inappropriate sites in addition to the appropriate sites . Mistargeted se - cretion might be harmful if secretory vesicles carry a spa - tial signal that normally helps maintain cell polarity . Given the polarized distribution of parts of the vesicle docking and fusion machinery , including Sec3p ( Finger et al . , 1998 ) , the same principle might apply to sec3 and snc1 (cid:68) snc2 (cid:68) mutants , where increased vesicle production in rich media could swamp the capacity of polarized fusion sites leading to fusion at inappropriate sites . The Myo2p NH 2 - Terminal Actin - binding Domain Targets Myo2p to Growth Sites The myo2 - 66 mutation removes a salt bridge in a con - served actin - binding loop of the Myo2p NH 2 - terminal mo - tor domain ( Lillie and Brown , 1994 ) . Lillie and Brown ( 1994 ) have shown the loss of Myo2 - 66p localization in a myo2 - 66 mutant shifted to 32 (cid:56) C for 75 min , whereas Walch - Solimena et al . ( 1997 ) have shown the loss of Sec4p localization in a myo2 - 66 mutant shifted to 37 (cid:56) C for 1 h . Here we show that the depolarization of Myo2 - 66p and Sec4p in myo2 - 66 yeast is extremely rapid , indicating that the motor domain is directly responsible for targeting Myo2p to the correct parts of the cell . Conversely , temperature shifting myo2 - 16 , a tail mu - tant , does not depolarize the Myo2 - 16p distribution , even though it completely depolarizes Sec4p . Instead , the Myo2 - 16p distribution is slightly more polarized than in wild - type yeast , which might be expected if Myo2 - 16p is released from vesicles that otherwise sterically slow down access of Myo2p to actin cables . The retention of Myo2 - 16p’s polarized distribution reflects active cable - depen - dent transport rather than trapping of Myo2 - 16p at the growth site , as the loss of cables in myo2 - 16 tpm1 - 2 tpm2 (cid:68) yeast depolarizes Myo2 - 16p but the restoration of cables rapidly repolarizes Myo2 - 16p . How , then , do we account for the Ayscough et al . ( 1997 ) finding that some Myo2p still concentrates at polarized sites despite depolymerization of actin with latrunculin - A ? Growth sites may nucleate or stabilize actin filaments so strongly that actin filaments remain there , but are too short or sparse to be detectable by fluorescence micros - copy . Alternatively , parts of the vesicle docking machinery may remain at polarized sites such that Myo2p can bind there . For example , latrunculin - A has no effect on the po - larized distribution of Sec3p , a protein required for effi - cient vesicle fusion or docking ( Finger et al . , 1998 ) . How - ever , this is unlikely to be the normal mechanism for Myo2p localization , as actin cable – dependent targeting of Myo2p is much more rapid and robust . Our attempts at re - producing the polarized Myo2p distribution in the pres - ence of latrunculin - A have failed : all of the treated cells have a diffuse Myo2p distribution , even the few cells that still have cortical actin patches faintly visible by rhoda - mine - phalloidin staining , whereas untreated cells have a normal Myo2p distribution . We also need to account for the depolarized Myo2p dis - tribution that has been reported for cells with disrupted Myo2p tail function , namely cells expressing the Myo2p tail construct of Reck - Peterson et al . ( 1999 ) and cells with the tail mutation myo2 - 2 that Catlett and Weisman ( 1998 ) isolated on the basis of a vacuole inheritance defect . The simplest explanation is that the Myo2p distribution repre - sents a balance between rapid translocation of Myo2p along cables to growth sites , and slower release or diffu - sion from those sites . The tail construct and myo2 - 2 may disrupt interactions that would otherwise retain Myo2p at growth sites or slow Myo2p diffusion . Since the Myo2p tail construct used by Reck - Peterson et al . ( 1999 ) contains an additional 44 - residue segment ( residues 1087 – 1130 ) and the single amino acid change in myo2 - 2 is at residue 1248 , another explanation is that the relatively unconserved proximal region of the tail might regulate Myo2p’s motor activity and translocation to the growth site . A precedent for autoregulation of a myosin by its COOH - terminal tail comes from a nonmuscle myosin II and a myosin I whose tails inhibit Mg 2 (cid:49) - ATPase activity ( Citi and Kendrick - Jones , 1987 ; Stoffler and Bahler , 1998 ) . Nevertheless , cargo does not seem to regulate Myo2p motor activity very strongly if at all , given the normal in - tracellular distribution of Myo2p in the absence of bound secretory vesicle cargo . Note that our results show that Myo2p continually cycles into the bud whether or not secretory vesicles are present . Indeed , the Myo2p distribu - tion is unaffected by sec12 - 4 , which blocks the production of secretory vesicles at the restrictive temperature ( data not shown ) . on A p r il 4 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published November 15 , 1999 Schott et al . The Myo2p Tail Polarizes Secretion 805 Myo2p Is Not Directly Involved in Organizing the Actin Cytoskeleton We show that the formation and polarity of actin patches and cables do not directly require functional MYO2 . Spe - cifically , the actin cytoskeleton is unaffected in myo2 ts mutants in the first minutes after shift to the restrictive temperature during which secretion becomes delocalized . However , cortical patches do eventually depolarize after 15 – 30 min of loss of either Myo2p protein function or tro - pomyosin - containing actin cables ( Pruyne et al . , 1998 ) . In contrast , actin patches depolarize within 1 min in wild - type yeast in response to stresses such as heat shock ( Lillie and Brown , 1994 ; data not shown ) and centrifugation ( Pringle et al . , 1991 ) , indicating that the effect of Myo2p and tro - pomyosin on actin patches is indirect . The Distal Half of the Myosin V COOH - Terminal Globular Domain Contains Features Associated with Vesicle Transport Among those post - Golgi secretory mutants that are syn - thetically lethal with myo2 - 66 , the small Rab GTPase mu - tant sec4 - 8 is particularly interesting , because Sec2p , its guanine nucleotide exchange factor , is the only SEC gene product known to be needed for polarized vesicle deliv - ery ( Walch - Solimena et al . , 1997 ) , suggesting that Sec4p marks vesicles for targeting to growth sites . We have found that a sec2 mutation rapidly depolarizes secretion at the restrictive temperature without affecting the Myo2p distribution ( Fig . 7 A ) , indicating that the sec2 mutation uncouples secretory vesicles from Myo2p . Furthermore , Sec4p resides specifically on the surface of late secretory vesicles in wild - type yeast ( Mulholland et al . , 1997 ; Walch - Solimena et al . , 1997 ) , and of the late sec mutations , sec4 - 8 and sec2 - 41 are the only ones known to be synthetically le - thal with (cid:68) smy1 ( Lillie and Brown , 1998 ) , implying a rela - tively direct interaction with MYO2 . The new myo2 ts al - leles provide additional insight into these interactions . Of the COOH - terminal myo2 ts alleles , myo2 - 14 is by far the most deleterious in combination with sec4 - 8 . The triv - ial explanation , that myo2 - 14 is the most severe allele be - low 30 (cid:56) C , is unlikely ; both myo2 - 12 and myo2 - 16 have milder synthetic growth defects with sec4 - 8 , but have lower restrictive temperatures than myo2 - 14 and impair growth in rich media , even at 24 (cid:56) C . The region altered in myo2 - 14 , the COOH - terminal 123 residues ( Table IV and Fig . 8 D ) , is therefore likely to be important for Sec4p - and Sec2p - dependent vesicle targeting . This strong allele spec - ificity and the uncoupling of secretory vesicles from Myo2p in a sec2 - 41 mutant support a model in which a ves - icle - associated Rab protein and its guanine nucleotide ex - change factor direct vesicle transport either by physically tethering the myosin V COOH terminus to vesicles or by activating a latent myosin V COOH terminus – binding re - ceptor on the vesicle surface . A screen for multicopy suppressors of myo2 ts tail mu - tants identified SMY1 , which has been isolated previously as a suppressor of myo2 - 66 ( Lillie and Brown , 1992 ) . SMY1 encodes a kinesin homologue that , like Myo2p , concentrates in regions of growth ( Lillie and Brown , 1994 ) and aids MYO2 function by a mechanism involving nei - ther a kinesin - like motor activity nor microtubules ( Lillie and Brown , 1998 ) . Since myo2 - 14 is the only myo2 ts mutant whose growth is unaltered by multicopy SMY1 , some part of the COOH - terminal 123 residues of Myo2p must affect functional in - teraction with SMY1 in addition to SEC4 , most likely the final 30 residues because myo2 - 14 is the only allele that changes this part of the extreme COOH terminus ( Fig . 8 D ) . It is unlikely that suppression of myo2 - 14 by SMY1 was overlooked due to a narrow temperature range where myo2 - 14 is only partially functional , as sec4 - 8 lowers myo2 - 14’ s restrictive temperature by at least 13 (cid:56) C . The strong suppression of some but not all COOH - terminal globular domain mutants by multicopy SMY1 , but com - paratively weak suppression of the motor domain mu - tant , taken together with Smy1p’s and Myo2p’s identical subcellular distributions ( Lillie and Brown , 1994 ) , and Smy1p’s apparent lack of its own motor activity ( Lillie and Brown , 1998 ) , suggests that Smy1p binds to the Myo2p globular tail domain directly . Binding of a kinesin to a my - osin V tail has been demonstrated in an animal system ( Huang et al . , 1999 ) , consistent with organelle transport occurring along microtubules using kinesin motors and then switching to myosin - driven transport along actin fila - ments near the final delivery site . Binding of a kinesin ho - mologue to the Myo2p tail could have originated in yeast’s hyphal ancestors . If so , Smy1p would have been kept be - cause it stabilizes a multiprotein complex with the Myo2p tail needed for docking onto organelles , but Smy1p’s mi - crotubule - binding and motor activities would have been lost in a cell too small and compact to need microtubule - based vesicle transport . Finally , comparison of the Myo2p sequence and the se - quence of Myo4p , an RNA - transporting myosin V in yeast , with type V myosins in other organisms supports a model in which , after duplication of the yeast genome ( Wolfe and Shields , 1997 ) resulting in two myosin V genes , one yeast myosin V selectively retained and the other yeast myosin V selectively lost features needed for mem - brane transport . These features are concentrated in the fi - nal 183 amino acid residues of Myo2p , a region that also contains the tail sequences most conserved among fungi , plants , animals , and cellular slime molds . In particular , an - imal myosin Vs known to be involved in membrane trans - port are much more similar in tail sequence to Myo2p than to Myo4p , despite overwhelming evidence that MYO2 and MYO4 arose from a comparatively recent duplication . Most of the tail mutations we isolated that affect polarized secretion make at least one nonconservative change in this region ( Fig . 8 D ) . Nevertheless , the varying effects of tail mutations on vesicle transport compared with vacuole transport implies that the recognition of different or - ganelles involves different features of the myosin tail . On the other hand , plant and Dictyostelium myosin V tails are more similar to Myo4p than to Myo2p in a more proximal part of the tail ( data not shown ) , but the func - tions of these myosin Vs are unknown . It would be inter - esting to know whether these myosins transport RNA , membranes , or both . In summary , the data presented here support a model for polarized secretion in which a myosin V COOH - termi - nal globular domain binds vesicles , and the NH 2 - terminal on A p r il 4 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published November 15 , 1999 The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 147 , 1999 806 motor domain drives translocation of the myosin and its attached cargo along tropomyosin - containing actin cables to the cargo’s destination . This cycle of myosin V transport does not depend on the secretory cargo marked by Sec4p , and we have identified regions of Myo2p tail that might bind cargo . We are grateful to the countless people who generously shared strains , plasmids , and reagents , and in particular to Peter Novick and Ruth Collins for providing anti - Sec4p antibody . D .
