Continued generation of the monomer pool by ﬁla - ment disassembly is therefore crucial . Disassem - blers like actin depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) / coﬁlin and ﬁlament cappers like capping protein ( CP ) are essential agonists of motility [ 3 – 8 ] , but the exact mo - lecular mechanisms by which they accelerate actin polymerization at the leading edge and ﬁlament turn - over has been debated for over two decades [ 9 – 12 ] . Whereas ﬁlament fragmentation by ADF / coﬁlin has long been demonstrated by total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence ( TIRF ) [ 13 , 14 ] , ﬁlament depolymeriza - tion was only inferred from bulk solution assays [ 15 ] . Using microﬂuidics - assisted TIRF microscopy , we provide the ﬁrst direct visual evidence of ADF’s simultaneous severing and rapid depolymerization of individual ﬁlaments . Using a conceptually novel assay to directly visualize ADF’s effect on a popula - tion of pre - assembled ﬁlaments , we demonstrate how ADF’s enhanced pointed - end depolymerization causes an increase in polymerizable actin mono - mers , thus promoting faster barbed - end growth . We further reveal that ADF - enhanced depolymeriza - tion synergizes with CP’s long - predicted ‘‘monomer funneling’’ [ 16 ] and leads to skyrocketing of ﬁlament growth rates , close to estimated lamellipodial rates . The ‘‘funneling model’’ hypothesized , on thermo - dynamic grounds , that at high enough extent of capping , the few non - capped ﬁlaments transiently grow much faster [ 15 ] , an effect proposed to be very important for motility . We provide the ﬁrst direct microscopic evidence of monomer funneling at the scale of individual ﬁlaments . These results signiﬁ - cantly enhance our understanding of the turnover of cellular actin networks . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Force is produced against membranes by ﬁlament barbed - end assembly , which requires maintenance of a pool of poly - merizable actin monomers feeding growing barbed ends . The steady - state monomer pool is maintained by pointed - end ﬁla - ment depolymerization . In this treadmilling concept , the bulk rate of barbed - end growth of the ﬁlament population balances the rate of pointed - end depolymerization . Pure actin ﬁlaments treadmill very slowly [ 17 ] compared to the rapid apparent tread - milling rates observed in intracellular lamellipodial actin arrays ; hence , cellular upregulation of the intrinsically slow treadmilling is required [ 18 ] . Actin depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) / coﬁlin and capping protein ( CP ) play a key role in motility in vivo [ 4 – 8 ] and in reconstituted in vitro assays [ 19 – 21 ] . However , the molecular mechanisms un - derlying how ADF by itself enhances motility are still unclear . In most single - ﬁlament studies , ADF / coﬁlin has been found to only fragment actin ﬁlaments [ 13 , 14 , 22 , 23 ] . However , severing ( in absence of barbed - end capping ) cannot increase the steady - state monomer concentration . Severing identically increases the number of barbed and pointed ends ; all individual ﬁlaments therefore treadmill at an unchanged rate , and the size of the monomer pool remains unchanged [ 1 ] . One group has however proposed that ADF’s enhanced ﬁlament depolymerization , monitored by bulk solution light scattering , was responsible for ADF’s effect on motility [ 15 , 24 , 25 ] . This proposal has been questioned because ADF’s enhanced ﬁlament depolymerization has so far never been microscopically visualized . Disassembly by ADF has rather been attributed to shortening by fragmenta - tion [ 14 ] . In the present study , we provide the ﬁrst visual evidence of ADF’s ﬁlament depolymerization in addition to its well - charac - terized ﬁlament severing . CP has also been shown to enhance motility in a concentra - tion - dependent fashion [ 19 , 26 – 28 ] . When a large number of ﬁlaments are exposed to CP , the fraction of ﬁlaments getting capped will be dependent on CP concentration ( fraction capped , g = ð½ CP (cid:2) = ½ CP (cid:2) + K C Þ , where K C = 0 . 1 nM is the equilibrium disso - ciation constant for CP binding to barbed ends ) [ 29 ] . When an increasing fraction of ﬁlaments gets capped , monomers released from all pointed ends feed the growth of only a few barbed ends that are not capped . These few non - capped barbed ends individually grow much faster than if all barbed 1990 Current Biology 27 , 1990 – 1998 , July 10 , 2017 ª 2017 The Author ( s ) . Published by Elsevier Ltd .

All depolymerization rates were found to be statistically signiﬁcant ( p < 0 . 05 ; two - sample t test ) compared to the control ( 0 ADF ) . ( legend continued on next page ) Current Biology 27 , 1990 – 1998 , July 10 , 2017 1991 ends were free to grow ( referred to as the ‘‘funneling effect’’ ; Fig - ure 4B ) [ 16 ] . This model has been contested , and CP has instead been proposed to enhance nucleation [ 12 ] . So far , ADF’s enhanced depolymerization and CP’s funneling have only been interpreted from bulk solution experiments . Nevertheless , ADF in association with its effector Aip1 appears to cause enhanced single - ﬁlament disassembly [ 30 , 31 ] . Here , we use microﬂuidics - assisted single - ﬁlament imaging [ 32 , 33 ] to reveal both severing and rapid depolymerization of actin ﬁla - ments by ADF alone . This assay is then adapted to monitor the effects of ADF and CP ( alone and together ) on the concentration of ATP monomers co - existing with ﬁlaments at steady state , thus providing ﬁrst direct visual evidence of the funneling effect . Fila - ments are anchored at one of their ends and not tethered to the surface all along their length . They are then exposed to a micro - ﬂuidic ﬂow of known biochemical composition . This method therefore avoids any mechanical interference with the change in ﬁlament twist due to ADF binding and also does not alter competition between side - binding anchoring proteins and ADF . Results presented here provide the ﬁrst single - ﬁlament demonstration that ADF and CP work synergistically to enhance treadmilling of individual ﬁlaments , accounting for their in vivo function . ADF Enhances Depolymerization Rate of Pointed and Barbed Ends We ﬁrst studied the effect of ADF on ﬁlament pointed ends . Fila - ments initiated from surface - anchored gelsolin - actin complexes were allowed to elongate at pointed ends . Filaments were then aged for 10 min to complete the transition to ADP - F - actin . This period is 6 - fold the Pi release half - time ( t 1 / 2 = 102 s ) [ 34 ] . ADP ﬁlaments were then exposed to a ﬂow of polymerization buffer ( F - buffer : 5 mM Tris - HCl [ pH 7 . 8 ] , 2 mM ATP , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM EGTA , 50 mM KCl , 10 mM DTT , and 1 mM DABCO ) con - taining increasing amounts of human ADF ( Figure 1A ) . Filaments exposed to F - buffer alone expectedly did not appreciably frag - ment within the observation period of 10 min and depolymerized extremely slowly from the pointed end ( 0 . 17 ± 0 . 04 subunits / s ; SD ; n = 50 ﬁlaments ; three independent experiments ) , in agree - ment with earlier single - ﬁlament studies ( 0 . 16 su / s ) [ 35 ] . These values are slightly lower than those from bulk measurements [ 17 ] , possibly due to the slower dissociation of photo - induced F - actin dimers [ 32 ] . Upon exposure to ADF , we observed both ﬁlament severing as well as faster pointed - end depolymerization ( between consecutive severing events ; Figure 1B ) . The fre - quency of severing increased with ADF concentration , as seen previously [ 22 , 36 ] . Figure 1E shows that 50 % of ﬁlaments ( mean length = 10 m m ) have severed at least once at t 1 / 2 = 40 s in the presence of 5 m M ADF , consistent with the scheme F / 2F and a ﬁrst - order fragmentation rate constant of ln ( 2 ) / t 1 / 2 = 0 . 017 s (cid:3) 1 for a 10 - m m - long ﬁlament ( see Movie S4 ) . The rate of pointed - end depolymerization also increased with ADF concen - tration in a saturating fashion up to a maximal rate of 3 . 72 ± 0 . 35 su / s ( n = 50 ﬁlaments ; three independent experiments ) at 5 m M ADF ( Figure 1C ; Movies S1 and S2 ) . The 22 - fold increase in depolymerization rate at pointed ends is similar to the 25 - fold increase observed in bulk measurements [ 15 ] . To evaluate the effect of ADF on depolymerization at barbed ends , we grew ﬁlaments from coverslip - anchored spectrin - actin seeds ( Figure 1A ) . The free barbed ends of the aged ADP - F - actin ﬁlaments were then exposed to ADF in F - buffer as above . In buffer alone , barbed ends depolymerize at 2 . 31 ± 0 . 27 su / s , similar to previous reports of (cid:4) 1 . 4 su / s [ 35 , 37 ] . The barbed - end depolymerization rate increased with ADF concentration in a saturating fashion ( Figure 1D ) up to about 16 . 54 ± 2 . 68 su / s at 5 m M ADF ( n = 50 ﬁlaments ; three independent experiments ) , in a trend similar to pointed ends ( Figure 1C ) . High frame rate im - aging ( 2 . 45 s per frame ) ensured that the observed rate of depo - lymerization was not just a collection of short severing events ( see Movie S3 ) . ADF’s destabilization of actin - actin interactions in the ﬁlament [ 38 ] , which promotes ﬁlament severing [ 13 , 22 , 23 , 39 ] , might also cause the enhanced disassembly at ﬁlaments ends . Why has this not been seen earlier ? A possible explanation lies in the methods used in earlier studies and maybe in the acknowl - edged quantitative differences between the various coﬁlins and ADF variants [ 40 , 41 ] . In previous studies , ﬁlaments were mostly maintained in the evanescent ﬁeld by surface anchoring [ 13 , 22 ] . The ﬁlament fragments generated by severing immediately left theevanescentﬁeld [ 22 ] , andshorteningoftheanchoredﬁlaments was interpreted as disassembly [ 14 ] . Our method , in which the ﬂow ( 50 – 100 m m / s ) maintains the ﬁlaments aligned in the evanes - cent ﬁeld , allows visualization and accurate measurement of both severinganddepolymerization . Earlier workfromour labusedthis technique to apply controlled forces on actin ﬁlaments anchored at one end ( see Figure 1A for experimental schematic ) [ 42 ] . Whereas the applied drag force increases steadily toward the anchorage point , the force is negligible at the free end . Low - ﬂow rates as used in this study ( 50 – 100 m m / s ) do not affect elongation , depolymerization [ 34 ] , or protein activity at the free end [ 42 ] . ADF - induced depolymerization at the free end will therefore be unaffected . We further checked that ﬂow had no effect on ADF - induced severing in the range of ﬂow rates used here ( see Fig - ure S1 ) . Future experiments with ﬂuorescently labeled ADF will be valuable in conﬁrming the results presented here . However , this has so far been a challenge because many of ADF’s eight cysteine residues are close to its actin - interaction regions [ 22 ] . TwinﬁlinandSrv2togetherhaverecentlybeenfoundtopromote asimilar increaseinpointed - end ( 17 - fold ) andbarbed - end ( 3 - fold ) depolymerization [ 37 ] . Aip1 also enhances depolymerization of ADF / coﬁlin - decorated ﬁlaments [ 31 , 43 ] . However , enhanced depolymerization by ADF / coﬁlin alone has so far never been visu - alized . Wehave demonstrated thatADF alone is sufﬁcient for both fragmentation and depolymerization of ﬁlaments , with identical concentration dependence . Both properties thus reﬂect the lower structural [ 38 ] , mechanical [ 44 ] , and thermodynamic stability of ADF - decorated than bare ﬁlaments . We do not see the reported decrease in severing of coﬁlin at high concentrations [ 13 ] .

Each curve consists of about 70 – 80 ﬁlaments of average length around 10 m m . 1992 Current Biology 27 , 1990 – 1998 , July 10 , 2017 severing mechanism used by ADF differs from the ‘‘hit and cut’’ mechanism used by gelsolin , Spire , or Cobl . ADF Increases Steady - State Monomer Concentration As discussed previously ( see [ 1 ] for a detailed quantitative discussion ) , severing of pure actin ﬁlaments by itself does not change the steady - state monomer concentration ( (cid:4) 0 . 1 m M ) . ADF’s effect on G - actin concentration has been evaluated by bulk assays—SDS - PAGE of supernatants of high - speed centri - fuged F - actin or measurements of ADF - increased amount of ATP - G - actin , ampliﬁed by sequestration by thymosin b 4 [ 24 ] . We designed a novel microﬂuidics - assisted total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence microscopy ( TIRFM ) assay to directly measure the monomeric ATP - actin concentration and monitor how ADF affects it . Tracer ﬁlaments exposing free barbed ends were then elongated from immobilized spectrin - actin seeds in a ﬂow containing 1 m M G - actin ( 10 % Alexa 488 labeled ) and 4 m M proﬁlin ( see Figure 2A for a schematic ) . The tracer ﬁlaments were then exposed to a ﬂow containing F - buffer with 5 m M 10 % Alexa - 488 - labeled F - actin , 3 m M proﬁlin , and varying amounts of ADF incubated to reach steady state ( (cid:4) 2 hr ) [ 15 ] . Proﬁlin enhances efﬁciency of treadmilling by preventing mono - mer association to pointed ends . The elongation rate of tracer ﬁlaments acts as a reliable reporter of the concentration of poly - merizable monomers ( mainly proﬁlin - actin ; see STAR Methods ) co - existing with the population of ﬂowing ﬁlaments at steady state . By varying ADF concentration , the effect of ADF on steady - state monomer concentration was quantiﬁed ( Figure 2B ) . In absence of ADF , tracer barbed ends grew very slowly ( 0 . 14 ± 0 . 05 su / s ; close to the rate of pointed - end disassembly and consistent with 0 . 1 m M proﬁlin - actin in the mix ) . In presence of ADF , tracer barbed ends grew faster , up to about 4 su / s at 2 m M ADF , which translates into a concentration of 0 . 54 m M proﬁ - lin - actin ( and negligible G - actin ; Figure 2B ) . The decline at higher ADF most likely reﬂects ADF - mediated inhibition of conversion of ADF - ADP - G - actin to ATP - G - actin [ 15 ] . ADF - induced severing events are visible between periods of barbed - end growth ( Fig - ure 2C ) . Interestingly , a few ﬁlaments from the bulk ﬂow some - times landed and bound non - speciﬁcally to the glass surface , exposing their two ends to the ﬂow . Because they were part of the bulk ﬂow , these ﬁlaments were actually at steady state . They displaybarbed - endgrowthandpointed - endshrinkageatidentical rates , maintaining constant length , i . e . , treadmilling ( Figures 2D and 2E ; Movie S5 ) . In conclusion , ADF enhances treadmilling by establishing a higher steady - state monomer concentration . CP Funnels Monomers to Uncapped Barbed Ends Capping of barbed ends is essential for actin - based motility [ 20 , 26 , 28 ] . CP has been proposed to ‘‘funnel’’ actin monomers released from all pointed ends onto a few non - capped ﬁlaments , locally initiated in cells by surface - bound nucleators , which tran - siently grow faster [ 19 , 20 ] . Funneling is expected to increase with the extent of capping and be most effective between 90 % and 99 . 9 % capping [ 45 ] . Pending direct visualization , this hypothesis has been challenged [ 12 ] . We investigated the ‘‘funneling effect’’ of CP using the above assay . Tracer barbed ends were exposed to a steady - state solution of 5 m M 10 % Alexa - 488 - labeled F - actin , proﬁlin ( 3 m M ) , and varying amounts of CP ( incubated overnight in F - buffer to reach steady state ) . At 0 . 2 nM CP , when 67 % of bulk ﬁlaments are capped ( Equations 7 and 8 ; STAR Methods ) , the tracer barbed ends elon - gate at 0 . 53 ± 0 . 14 su / s , corresponding to a concentration of 130 nM proﬁlin - actin and 5 nM G - actin monomers ( Figures 3A and 3B ) . At 5 nM CP ( 98 % bulk ﬁlaments capped ) , the tracer growth rate of 8 . 06 ± 0 . 28 su / s corresponds to a steady - state 0 . 85 m M proﬁlin - actin and 40 nM G - actin . Expectedly , tracer ends also get capped faster with increasing CP concentration ( k + C = 4 . 06 ± 0 . 17 m M (cid:3) 1 s (cid:3) 1 ; Figure S2 ) [ 29 ] . The results demon - strateanon - lineardependenceofthesteady - statemonomercon - centration on the extent of capping , notably ampliﬁed by proﬁlin ( Figure 3B ) [ 16 , 45 ] . At CP concentrations above 5 nM , tracer ﬁlaments get capped too rapidly to allow elongation rate measurements . We therefore used formin - bound barbed ends as tracers . The 500 - fold lower afﬁnity of CP for formin - bound barbed ends [ 46 , 47 ] allowed us to test higher CP concentrations in the ﬂowing F - actin mix ( up to 20 nM CP ; 99 . 5 % capping ) . Fluorescent ﬁlaments were nucle - ated from surface - anchored formin mDia1 FH1 - FH2 by ﬂowing in 1 m M labeled G - actin with 1 m M proﬁlin . These formin - anchored ‘‘tracer’’ ﬁlaments were then exposed to a ﬂow containing unla - beled 5 m M F - actin , 3 m M proﬁlin , and varying amounts of CP . The ﬂuorescent distal fragment of the tracer ﬁlament moves due toinsertionaladditionofunlabeledactinmonomers ( boundtopro - ﬁlin ) at formin - anchored barbed ends ( Figure 3C ) . The elongation rate of formin - bound tracer ends increased up to 130 su / s at 20 nM CP ( Figures 3D and 3E ) . Assuming a value of 50 m M (cid:3) 1 . s (cid:3) 1 for the association rate constant of proﬁlin - actin to formin - bound ﬁlaments [ 42 ] , the 130 su / s elongation rate translates to a steady - state concentration ofproﬁlin - actin ofabout 2 . 6 m M ( at equilibrium with 0 . 6 m M ATP - G - actin , close to the critical concentration for pointed end assembly ) . In conclusion , capping of ﬁlaments at steady state enhances the growth rate of the few uncapped ﬁlaments by increasing the steady - state concentration of polymerizable monomers , thus validating the ‘‘funneling effect . ’’ Results presented here clarify a discrepancy between the re - ported enhancement of actin - based propulsion of Listeria and N - WASP beads by CP , inhibition at high capper concentrations [ 19 , 27 ] , which were at variance with the observations and inter - pretation of CP function made by Akin and Mullins [ 12 ] . A key dif - ference between the experiments of Akin and Mullins and ours is that , whereas our ﬂowing actin solutions consist of F - actin ( and actin monomers ) at steady state , Akin and Mullins’s experiments contained only G - actin and CP at time zero . Hence , the ﬁlament elongation rate and resulting propulsion rates varied as G - actin was depleted with time . A recent theoretical study argued that CP increases monomer concentration only near the loca - tion of branched nucleation at the surface of an ActA - coated bead [ 11 ] . In contrast , our results actually show a global increase in bulk monomer concentration . Thus , our steady - state in vitro results appear to account for in vivo effects of CP on motility [ 1 ] . ADF and CP Synergistically Enhance the Concentration of Polymerizable Actin Monomers and Barbed - End Assembly at Steady State We have thus far shown that ADF and CP individually increase actin monomer concentration . We next explored their functional cooperation when they are present together with F - actin . Tracer barbed ends were nucleated and exposed to solutions of F - actin Current Biology 27 , 1990 – 1998 , July 10 , 2017 1993 and proﬁlin at steady state , containing either ADF alone , CP alone , or both ( Figures 3F and 3G ) . At 1 m M ADF and 5 nM CP , the elongation rate of tracer barbed ends was 24 su / s as compared to 4 su / s in presence of 1 m M ADF alone and 8 su / s in presence of 5 nM CP alone . ADF and CP therefore synergize and promote a 160 - fold faster elongation rate than in absence of CP and ADF ( (cid:4) 0 . 14 su / s ) . With 1 m M ADF and 5 nM CP , steady - state monomer concentration increases to about 2 . 5 m M ( Figure 3G ) . Initial total actin concentration ( 5 m M ) was chosen such that it is higher than the maximal steady - state Figure 2 .

Proﬁlin concen - tration ( 3 m M ) was kept high enough to ensure that most mono - meric actin gets converted to proﬁlin - actin and low enough that proﬁlin does not compete with CP at barbed ends [ 48 ] . ADF establishes a higher ATP - monomer concentration and results in faster ( but equal ) global rates of barbed - end growth and pointed - end depolymerization ( Figure 4C ) . This effect cumulates with CP - mediated funneling ( Figures 4B and 4E ) in a synergistic fashion ( Figures 4D and 4E ) . The individual and cooperative regulations by ADF and CP have been demon - strated here at the single - ﬁlament scale , thanks to an original approach for direct TIRF - based measurement of monomer concentration . The growth rate measurements are consistent with the ones expected from a graphical representation of the contribution of barbed and pointed ends of ﬁlaments to the steady state of actin assembly ( Figure 4E ) . Elongation rates of 24 su / s at 1 m M ADF and 5 nM CP are in close agreement with estimates of lamellipodial barbed - end assembly rates ( 66 su / s ) [ 49 , 50 ] . Our results represent a major step forward in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which cells might control a steady - state monomer pool that Figure3 .

Combined Effects of ADF and CP onBarbed - End GrowthRate atSteady State ( A ) Control ﬁlaments ( four shown ) treadmill very slowly due to low steady - state polymerizable monomer ( (cid:4) 0 . 1 m M ; mainlyproﬁlin - actin ) , atwhich barbed - endgrowthrate ( V BE = k + B . ( [ A ] SS + [ PA ] SS (cid:3) C c ) ; see Equations 5 and 6 ; STAR Methods ) balances slow pointed - end depolymerization ( V PE (cid:4)(cid:3) 0 . 17 su / s ) . ( B ) In the presence of CP ( 90 % capping ) , all pointed ends feed a fewer number ( 10 % ) of un - capped barbed ends , which individually grow faster . ( C ) In thepresenceof ADF , enhanced pointed - end depolymerization ( 2 su / s at saturation by ADF ) establishesahigherconcentration [ PA SS ] ( 0 . 5 m M ) . ( D ) In the presence of both ADF and capping protein ( CP ) , [ PA SS ] further increases and non - capped barbed ends grow faster . ( E ) Graphical representation of the effects of ADF and CP on the contribution of barbed - and pointed - end dynamics in establishing the steady state of actin assembly . Red and blue lines represent the change in elongation rates at ﬁla - ment barbed and pointed ends , respectively , versus monomeric actin concentration in the presence of 3 m M proﬁlin . Due to the presence of proﬁlin , pointed ends only depolymerize at con - stant rate : 0 . 17 su / s in absence of ADF ( contin - uousline ) ; 2su / sinpresenceof1 m MADF ( dashed line ) ; and 5 su / s in presence of saturating ADF ( dotted line ) . Barbed ends grow with 100 % free ( non - capped ) barbed ends ( continuous red line ) or 90 % capped barbed ends ( dotted red line indicates bulk growth rate ) . The steady - state monomer concentration is ﬁrst determined as the monomer concentration at which pointed end disassembly equals barbed end assembly bulk rate . The elongation rate V i of individual barbed ends at steady state is then read on the graph as the rate of non - capped barbed end ( contin - uous red line ) at the steady - state monomer concentration . Conditions shown as examples are as follows : no regulator ( V 0 ) ; + 2 nM CP : ( V 1 ) ; + saturating ADF ( V 2 ) ; and + both 1 m M ADF and CP ( V 3 ) . 1996 Current Biology 27 , 1990 – 1998 , July 10 , 2017 d QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS d DATA AND SOFTWARE AVAILABILITY SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION Supplemental Information includes two ﬁgures and ﬁve movies and can be found with this article online at http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . cub . 2017 . 05 . 036 .

The beakerwas then placed ina warm waterbath at 20 - 25 (cid:5) C and mixing was continued by magnetic stirring until temperature reached 15 (cid:5) C . The solution was then placed on ice without any further mixing until temperature reached 5 (cid:5) C . The solution was once again centrifuged at 25 , 000 x g for 30 min at 4 (cid:5) C . The pellet , which consisted of alpha - actinin - actingel , wasdiscardedandthesupernatantwasﬁlteredoverglasswool . Theﬁltratewasthendialyzedovernightat4 (cid:5) Cagainst32 volumes of dialysis bufferD1 ( 2 mM Tris - HCl , pH7 . 8 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT ) . KCl was added to the dialyzate to a ﬁnal concentration of 0 . 8 M and mixing continued with magnetic agitation for 1 . 5 hr at 4 (cid:5) C followed by centrifugation for 3 . 5 hr at 100 , 000 x g at 4 (cid:5) C . The supernatant containingtropomyosinwas discarded and thepellet ofF - actinwas gentlyresuspended ina total volume of 25 mlofextrac - tion X buffer . 75 m l of1 M MgCl 2 and 375 m l of4 M KClwas added and the volume was completed to38 . 6 mLwith extractionX - bufferand homogenized .

The last two thirds of the main monomer peak were collected , their absorbance at 290 nm was measured and concentration wascalculated ( molar extinction coefﬁcient ofactin at 290 nm = 0 . 617 mg / ml and themolecularweight is42 kDa ) . The typical yield of this preparation is 40 mL at 55 ± 10 m M ( 2 . 3 ± 0 . 4 mg / ml ) G - actin . Puriﬁed G - actin can be stored on ice for up to 3 weeks . Puriﬁed actin was labeled by reacting Alexa 488 NHS Ester dye with F - actin exposed surface lysine residues as follows . 2 mL of puriﬁed G - actin ( concentration (cid:4) 50 m M ) was polymerized by dialyzing it overnight at 4 (cid:5) C against modiﬁed F - buffer ( 20 mM PIPES pH 6 . 9 , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM ATP and 100 mM KCl ) . The F - actin was labeled by incubation with the dye ( ﬁnal concentration 0 . 25 mM ) for two hours at room temperature in the dark on a rotating wheel . Labeled F - actin was then centrifuged at 450 , 000 x g for 30 min at room temperature . The pellet of labeled F - actin was resuspended in 2 mL of G - buffer ( 5 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 8 , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 M ATP , 0 . 01 % NaN 3 and 5 mM DTT ) homogenized using a potter and then allowed to depolymerize on ice in the dark for 2 hr . This solution was re - polymerized by adding MgCl 2 and KCl ( ﬁnal concentrations of 1 mM and 100 mM ) and incu - bating on ice for one hour followed by centrifugation at 450 , 000 x g for 30 min at 4 (cid:5) C . The supernatant was discarded and the pellet of polymerizable labeled F - actin was homogenized in 2 mL of G - buffer using a potter .

The transformed cells were then grown in LB in presence of selection antibiotics . The cells were then induced with IPTG overnight and resuspended next morning in 100 mL of Lysis Buffer ( 20 mM NaPO 4 pH 7 . 8 , 500 mM NaCl , 15 mM Imidazole , 0 . 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 5 % Tween - 20 , 1 mM DTT , 1 mM PMSF , Protease Inhibitors ) to which 0 . 5 mg / ml of lysozyme was added .

Fractions containing the protein were pooled together and protein concentration was determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm ( calculated molar extinction coefﬁcient = 42400 M - 1 cm - 1 ) . Puriﬁed SNAP - mDia1 was then biotinylated by reacting benzylguanine – biotin ( New England Biolabs ) following vendor prescribed procedure . Bio - tinylated protein was ﬂash frozen with liquid nitrogen and store at (cid:3) 80 (cid:5) C . Single ﬁlament microscopy The kinetics of individual ﬁlament assembly / disassembly was monitored using microﬂuidics coupled to ﬂuorescence microscopy [ 47 ] ( [ 52 ] for review ) . A 40 m m high PDMS mold with 3 inlets was stuck onto a clean coverslip . First , the coverslip surface was function - alized and passivated using a 1 : 40 PLL - PEG - Biotin : PLL - PEG mixture at 1 mg / mL in PBS , for 30 min at room temperature . The cham - ber was rinsed and further incubated with 10 m g / mL neutravidin in PBS for 5 min . Filaments were then initiated either from biotinylated spectrin - actin seeds exposing their barbed ends in a distal position , or Gelsolin - actin seeds or from immobilized biotinylated SNAP - mDia1 ( FH1 - FH2 - DAD ) formin with their pointed ends in a distal position , thus allowing insertional ﬁlament assembly ( incubation con - centration for each ligand is 100 pM ) [ 47 ] . This gives about 25 - 50 ﬁlaments per ﬁeld of view . Gelsolin - actin GA2 seeds were prepared by mixing 2 . 5 molar equivalent of G - actin to Gelsolin in G - buffer . Standard conditions for growing tracer ﬁlaments from spectrin - actin seeds is 1 m M actin and 4 m M proﬁlin and for nucleating ﬁlaments from anchored formins is 1 m M actin and 1 m M proﬁlin . Actin was 10 % Alexa 488 labeled in assays where ﬁlaments pointed ends were anchored by spectrin - actin seeds . When ﬁlaments were assem - bled from immobilized formin ( anchored growing barbed ends ) , ﬁlaments were initiated with 10 % Alexa 488 labeled actin , then elon - gated from unlabeled actin and their dynamics were monitored [ 47 ] . All experiments were carried out at room temperature in F - buffer ( 5 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 8 , 2 mM ATP , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM EGTA , 50 mM KCl , 10 mM DTT , and 1 mM DABCO ) . All ﬁlaments in the ﬁeld of view were taken into account ( n (cid:4) 20 - 30 per ﬁeld of view ) . They were all analyzed and their rates of elongation / depolymerization measured . Each experiment was repeated at least 3 times and the ﬁlaments in the 3 ﬁelds of view were pooled together . Microscopy data acquisition and analysis Actin ﬁlaments were imaged on an Olympus IX71 TIRF microscope equipped with a 60x objective and a Cascade II EMCCD camera ( Photometrics ) . Images were analyzed using the ImageJ Kymograph plugin and the slopes were measured to determine the elonga - tion / depolymerization rate of individual ﬁlaments . One actin subunit contributes to 2 . 7 nm of the ﬁlament length . Background ﬂuo - rescence was subtracted automatically using the built - in rolling ball background subtraction algorithm ( rolling ball radius 5 pixels ) . Determination of steady - state monomer concentration from barbed - end growth rate ( Figures 2B , 3B , and 3E ) Microﬂuidics - assisted TIRFM experiments aiming at monitoring the dynamics of free barbed ends in the presence of CP and ADF were performed using a ﬂow of F - actin assembled at steady state in the presence of 3 m M proﬁlin . ‘‘Tracer ﬁlaments’’ with free barbed ends were ﬁrst initiated on the coverslipfrom anchoredspectrin - actin seeds . The tracer barbedends werethen exposed to a ﬂow containing the steady - state solution . In the steady - state mix of F - actin and proﬁlin ( with and without CP or ADF ) , ATP - monomers predominantly consistofproﬁlin - actin ( in addition toaverysmallamountofG - actini . e . , (cid:4) nM , seerelevantEquations4 , 5 , and6 below ) . Proﬁlin at3 m M ensures that these monomers cannot add to pointed ends , and that the medium is biochemically more similar to physiological condi - tions . When the steady - state mix containing F - actin and polymerizable monomers is ﬂowed over the tracer barbed ends , the tracer ﬁlaments elongate at a rate V , whichis proportionalto the concentration of polymerizable monomers ( [ A ] SS + [ PA ] SS ) in the mix . The con - centration of each of the two species of polymerizable monomers can then be calculated using the following equations : Parameter deﬁnition : 1 . V = rate of barbed end elongation at steady state ( as measured ) . 2 . [ A ] ss + [ PA ] SS = total concentration of polymerizable monomers at steady state ( to be determined ) . 3 . [ P ] total = total concentration of proﬁlin = 3 m M 4 . C C = critical concentration for assembly of either A or PA at the barbed end of a ﬁlament = 0 . 08 m M [ 53 ] . 5 . K P = Equilibrium dissociation constant for proﬁlin - actin complex = 0 . 1 m M [ 54 ] 6 . k + = on - rate of polymerizable monomers ( G - actin and Proﬁlin - Actin ) at the barbed end = 10 s - 1 m M - 1 [ 53 ] [ 48 ] V = k + : (cid:1) ½ A (cid:2) SS + ½ PA (cid:2) SS (cid:3) C C (cid:3) ( 1 ) P total = ½ P (cid:2) SS + ½ PA (cid:2) SS ( 2 ) e4 Current Biology 27 , 1990 – 1998 . e1 – e5 , July 10 , 2017 K P = ½ P (cid:2) SS : ½ A (cid:2) SS ½ PA (cid:2) SS ( 3 ) Combining the laws of mass action and mass conservation into Equation 1 leads to : ½ A (cid:2) 2 SS + ½ A (cid:2) SS : (cid:4) K P + P total (cid:3) C C (cid:3) V k + (cid:5) (cid:3) K P : (cid:4) C C + V k + (cid:5) = 0 ( 4 ) from which the values of [ A ] SS and [ PA ] SS can be derived at each measured value of V , using the known values of parameters K P , [ P ] total and C C ½ A (cid:2) SS = (cid:3) (cid:6) K P + P total (cid:3) C C (cid:3) V k + (cid:7) ± ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ(cid:6) K P + P total (cid:3) C C (cid:3) V k + (cid:7) 2 + 4 : K P : (cid:6) C C + V k + (cid:7) r 2 ( 5 ) ½ PA (cid:2) SS = P total : ½ A (cid:2) SS ½ A (cid:2) SS + K P ( 6 ) Calculation of increase in elongation rate as a function of CP concentration ( Figures 3B and 3E ) Pointed - ends of pure actin ﬁlaments disassemble at a constant rate of about 0 . 17 su / s in absence of ADF ( Figure 1C ) . An F - actin mix at steady - state therefore contains very low amount of polymerizable monomers . If Capping Protein is added to the mix such that majority of ( > 90 % ) of barbed ends in the mix are capped , the value of [ A ] SS and [ PA ] SS increase , and the elongation rate of tracer barbed ends increases accordingly . At a given concentration of Capping Protein , [ CP ] , the fraction of bulk actin ﬁlaments capped at a given time is given by : g = ½ CP (cid:2) ½ CP (cid:2) + K C ( 7 ) where K C = 0 . 1nM [ 29 ] is the equilibrium dissociation constant for CP binding to barbed ends . Speciﬁcally , if J PSS is the steady - state rate of pointed - end disassembly ( 0 . 17 su / s in absence of ADF ) , the elongation rate of few non - capped barbed ends ( or tracer barbed ends ) J Bfree is given by the equation below [ 16 ] : J Bfree = (cid:3) J PSS ð 1 (cid:3) g Þ : ( 8 ) This equation is used to calculate the expected elongation rate in presence of varying amount of CP in Figure 3B . Equation 5 and 6 were used to calculate the actual amount of polymerizable monomers from the measured elongation rate of tracer barbed ends . Note that proﬁlin ampliﬁes the effect of capping by establishing a higher steady - state amount of monomers than if only free G - actin contributed in barbed end growth ( Figure 3B ) . QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS For single - ﬁlament imaging , a ﬁeld of view containing at least 20 - 30 ﬁlaments was chosen and time - lapsed images were acquired for acquired for at least 30 frames ( over at least 150 s ) . The elongation / depolymerization rates of all the ﬁlaments in the ﬁeld of view were measured . The experiment was repeated 3 times and the results from the three independent experiments were cumulated ( minimum number of ﬁlaments analyzed = 50 ) . The average and standard deviation from the pooled data was determined . All error bars plotted in the ﬁgures represent the standard deviation of the pooled data . n , the exact number of ﬁlaments measured for each condition , is mentioned in respective ﬁgure legends . For Figures 1C , 1D , 2B , 3B , 3E , and 3G the statistical signiﬁcance was ascertained using two - sample t test using Origin data analysis software ( OriginLab Corporation ) , and p < 0 . 05 was taken as the threshold for signiﬁcance . In each graph , the lowest rate of elongation / depolymerization ( seen for the leftmost data point on the x axis ) is taken as the base value to which all the other rates are tested for statistical signiﬁcance . Each ﬁgure legend contains the details for how statistical signiﬁcance was tested .
