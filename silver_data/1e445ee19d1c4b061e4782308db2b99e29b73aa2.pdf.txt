Journal : Cell Publication Year : 2014 Authors : Michael Levine , Claudia Cattoglio , Robert Tjian PubMed link : 24679523 Funding Grants : Interdisciplinary Training in Stem Cell Biology , Engineering and Medicine Public Summary : Comparative genome analyses reveal that organismal complexity scales not with gene number but with gene regulation . The human genome likely contains hundreds of thousands of enhancers ( gene regulatory sequences ) , with a typical protein coding region embedded in a milieu of tens of enhancers . Here we review progress in unraveling one of the outstanding mysteries of modern biology : the dynamic communication of remote enhancers with target promoters in the specification of cellular identity . Scientific Abstract : Comparative genome analyses reveal that organismal complexity scales not with gene number but with gene regulation . Recent efforts indicate that the human genome likely contains hundreds of thousands of enhancers , with a typical gene embedded in a milieu of tens of enhancers . Proliferation of cis - regulatory DNAs is accompanied by increased complexity and functional diversification of transcriptional machineries recognizing distal enhancers and core promoters and by the high - order spatial organization of genetic elements . We review progress in unraveling one of the outstanding mysteries of modern biology : the dynamic communication of remote enhancers with target promoters in the specification of cellular identity . 1
