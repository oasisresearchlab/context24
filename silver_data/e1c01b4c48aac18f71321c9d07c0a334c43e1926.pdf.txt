SHARED HYPERMEDIA WORKSPACES Shared workspaces provide users with a virtual space in which information can be shared an exchanged . They aim at supporting cooperative tasks and are used for synchronous and asynchronous cooperation [ 4 ] . Synchronous cooperation means cooperation happening at the same time with typically fine - grained notifications of other users’ actions giving immediate feedback about the activities of other users . Asynchronous cooperation can happen at different times . Workspace awareness then focuses on e . g . awareness - specific attributes of objects , timelines , history elements or change notifications since last login . Shared hypermedia workspaces provide cooperative access to and manipulation of shared hypermedia structures [ 8 ] . A shared enterprise hypermedia workspace needs to support cooperative modeling and execution of shared work processes . In addition , run - time extensibility of hypermedia structures as well as tools and views operating on emerging hypermedia structures need to be supported . For this component - based and service - oriented architectures are very helpful . For users collaborating synchronously we can distinguish between distributed users and face - to - face users . Most shared hypermedia workspace approaches focus on distributed users , such as wikis or the approaches in [ 4 ] or [ 8 ] . In [ 11 ] roomware® is described as computer - augmented objects resulting from the integration of room elements , e . g . walls and tables , with computer - based information devices . In “i - LAND” different roomware® components have been integrated . This 2 . Jessica Rubart SIGWEB Newsletter Summer 2014 integration provides special support for face - to - face users . Interaction design of i - LAND focuses on touch - sensitive displays . We are currently extending shared hypermedia workspaces for distributed users with face - to - face multitouch experiences . Touch and tabletop technology has been widely applied to education , e . g . [ 2 ] , computer games , e . g . [ 5 ] , and art design , e . g . [ 7 ] . Compared to traditional user interfaces richer user experience is pointed out . Another trend is to use surface technologies for analysis work [ 1 ] . Visualization techniques and exploring huge amounts of data are in the focus . In [ 3 ] digital tabletop technology is applied to collocated agile software planning meetings . It focuses on single touch displays . Multiple users are considered , but they cannot interact with the system at the same time . Our approach uses gestures that can be executed individually or in cooperation and applies multitouch single display groupware to shared hypermedia workspaces . As an application scenario we have selected the Scrum planning approach to software development [ 10 ] . It is according to a recent survey the most often used approach among software development teams utilizing an agile methodology [ 12 ] . In [ 9 ] we have presented a flexible cooperative task board for supporting daily scrum meetings for distributed team members as an application of different hypermedia domains . Scrum task boards are handled like shared hypermedia workspaces . Synchronous cooperation is required in the typical daily scrum meeting scenario . Therefore , we have developed a particular solution for face - to - face Scrum development teams utilizing multitouch technology and complementing solutions for distributed team members . 2 . APPLICATION SCENARIO : SCRUM Scrum is an iterative and incremental project and change management approach , which focuses on close interactions and strong communication between developers , business stakeholders , and customers . Scrum uses short iterations , i . e . sprints , during which the team develops an increment of functionality . The development team works self - organized , and for each sprint it reviews , discusses , selects , and commits the functionality the team thinks it can deliver after the respective sprint . Daily Scrum meetings , so - called Daily Standups , support the team in organizing itself . They take place once per day during a sprint , at the same time , and they should be time - boxed to 15 minutes . Team members meet in front of a task board and update their status of work . The task board captures what is called the sprint backlog . Each task belongs to Extending Shared Hypermedia Workspaces to Face - to - Face Multitouch Experiences 3 SIGWEB Newsletter Summer 2014 one backlog item . Backlog items describe required functionality for the system and are estimated by the team and prioritized by the product owner managed in a product backlog . A task is a small unit of work that has been identified and estimated by the team . A task should not take longer than 8 hours . In a daily Scrum meeting tasks are moved between the status columns and taken by team members . In addition , new tasks can be identified or an existing task can be split or removed . The team also talks about impediments because of which tasks cannot be completed and updates the impediment backlog . Finally , the team updates the so - called sprint burn down chart to visualize whether the work gets done in the necessary time . Thus , sprint burn down charts are a way of reporting the status of work . 3 . A COOPERATIVE MULTITOUCH SCRUM TASK BOARD Displaying visualizations on multitouch surfaces that can be manipulated cooperatively allows analysts and planners a new level of interaction [ 1 ] . Data can be explored in parallel simultaneously by multiple users . Data objects can be moved , sorted , resized , rotated , and visually arranged using natural gestures like those that would be used in exploring real - world objects . Figure 1 shows a first version of our cooperative multitouch Scrum Task Board . It runs on a MS Windows 8 - based multitouch table . The display can also be used as a vertical board . The Scrum Task Board is targeting large displays . The board shows the columns Selected Product backlog , Tasks to do , Tasks in progress , and Tasks done . Used as a table , the column headings are presented rotated 180° to both long sides of the table . The backlog items are not allowed to be moved to one of the tasks’ columns . The tasks are movable between their different columns to represent their status of work respectively . All interaction results are saved automatically . We use gestures , which can be executed individually or in cooperation . For the individual gestures we use widespread gestures from smartphones and tablets . These are applied to moving , resizing , and rotating a task , and can also be executed by multiple users , e . g . enlarging a task . A double touch event in a task column Figure 1 : A Cooperative Multitouch Scrum Task Board 4 . Jessica Rubart SIGWEB Newsletter Summer 2014 creates a new task in that column . A touch event on a task presents a menu that offers the possibilities to delete the task , to split it , or to open the task’s on - screen keyboard on the display . Keyboards and tasks , which belong together , are marked with rectangles in the same color . On - screen keyboards can be moved like tasks . This represents a kind of floor control for the respective task and supports coordination . Several keyboards for different tasks can be used simultaneously . At any time the team can switch to the reporting view . It shows the current sprint burn down chart of Scrum to visualize whether the work gets done in the necessary time . The reports are shown as documents , which can be moved , resized , rotated , and visually arranged using multitouch gestures individually or in cooperation . In addition , they can be marked . In this way , a group discussion of the analysis results is supported . COMBINING HYPERMEDIA DOMAINS The user interface design of the cooperative task board is derived from paper - based notes on a physical board . From our point of view this design approach is well aligned with the manifest for agile development 1 as it focuses on simplicity . The backlog items are chosen from the product backlog for the current sprint and listed in the first column . In order to assign a task to a backlog item its vertical position ( y - coordinate ) needs to be aligned with the backlog item ' s position . The horizontal position ( x - coordinate ) determines the task ' s state , i . e . To Do , In Progress , or Done . Moving a task up or down changes the task ' s association with the backlog items , moving it from one column to another changes its state . This is very much in line with the spatial hypertext domain [ 6 ] , where spatial proximity and visual attributes are used to derive semantics . Within one column we do not enforce a special layout as the manually given positions can be of importance for the team members . But an automatic layout functionality can be used . It uses spatial recognition to assign tasks to backlog items . Navigational hypermedia is used to go back and forth between views or to navigate from a task to its current impediments .
