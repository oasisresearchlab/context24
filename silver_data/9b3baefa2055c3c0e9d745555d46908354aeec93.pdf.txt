James’s University Hospital , Leeds , UK ; 5 Institut de Recherches Servier , Division de Cance´rologie Expe´rimentale , 92150 Suresnes , France E - cadherin is a cell - cell adhesion molecule expressed predominantly by epithelial cells . Reduction or loss of E - cadherin immunoreactivity has been associated with tumour progression in many epithelial cancers , including bladder carcinomas . The ﬁbroblast growth factor receptor 2b ( FGFR2b ) recognized speciﬁcally by FGF7 is expressed only by epithelial cells . Recently , decreased expression of FGFR2b protein and mRNA was found to be associated with tumour progression in bladder carcinomas . The purpose of this investigation was to look for a possible relationship between E - cadherin and FGFR2b expression in bladder carcinomas . As decreased E - cadherin immunoreactivity was found to correlate directly with decreased expression at the mRNA level , the possible relationship between E - cadherin and FGFR2b was investigated at the mRNA level using semi - quantitative RT – PCR in 92 transitional cell carcinomas ( TCCs ) and four lymph node metastases . All tumours with low E - cadherin expression had low expression of FGFR2b , whereas tumours with low FGFR2b mRNA could express any level of E - cadherin mRNA . The same observation was equally valid for bladder and colon cancer cell lines suggesting that , besides bladder tumours , this relationship could apply to other carcinomas types . These results suggest that a relationship exists between the transcription of the E - cadherin and FGFR2b genes preventing high expression of FGFR2b where expression of E - cadherin is low . We suggest that reduced expression of FGFR2b in conjunc - tion with decreased expression of E - cadherin may contribute to the aggressive behaviour attributable to high grade TCCs . Keywords : bladder ; E - cadherin ; ﬁbroblast growth factor receptor ; human , transitional cell carcinoma Tumour progression is accompanied by altered expression of multiple components including growth factors , growth factor receptors and cell adhesion molecules . A large number of studies have indicated that a major cause for invasiveness of carcinoma cells is a disturbance of the integrity of intercellular junctions , often involving functional loss of the cell - cell adhesion molecule E - cadherin , the prototypic member of the cadherin superfamily . In vitro an inverse correlation has been found between the level of E - cadherin expression and invasive capacity ( Frixen et al . , 1991 ) . Treatment of canine kidney epithelial cells with a monoclonal antibody against E - cadherin results in the acquisition of invasiveness ( Behrens et al . , 1989 ) . Conversely , transfection of E - cadherin cDNA in non - expressing cells abrogates their invasive properties ( Frixen et al . , 1991 ; Vleminckx et al . , 1991 ) . Immunohistochemical examination of clinical speci - mens of many di(cid:128)erent carcinomas including bladder has shown that decreased E - cadherin expression is associated with poor prognosis ( Takeichi , 1993 ; Birchmeier and Behrens , 1994 ; Bringuier et al . , 1993 ; Otto et al . , 1994 ) . This down - regulation can result from several mechanisms : alteration of transcription ( methylation , loss of transactivators or chromatin rearrangement in the regulatory region ) , posttransla - tional modiﬁcations or changes in the interaction of E - cadherin with cytoskeleton anchoring catenin proteins ( Giroldi et al . , 1994 ; Gra(cid:128) et al . , 1995 ; Yoshiura et al . , 1995 ; Hennig et al . , 1995 ) . Inactivating mutations have been found commonly only in breast cancer of the lobular type and in di(cid:128)use type gastric carcinomas ( Oda et al . , 1994 ; Becker et al . , 1994 ; Berx et al . , 1996 ; Guilford et al . , 1998 ) . Urinary bladder transitional cell carcinoma ( TCC ) is the ﬁfth most common cancer in men in Western countries . Bladder carcinomas are distinguished as either muscle invasive or superﬁcial . Invasive tumours are generally associated with poor prognosis , whereas the clinical outcome of superﬁcial tumours is relatively unpredictable . In order to identify new molecules involved in bladder tumour progression , we have looked for changes in the level of expression of growth factors and their cognate receptors between normal urothelium and bladder carcinomas of di(cid:128)erent stages and grades . We have previously reported that the epithelial - speciﬁc isoform of the ﬁbroblast growth factor receptor 2b ( FGFR2b ) was down - regulated in a subset of bladder tumours with poor prognosis ( Gil Diez de Medina et al . , 1997 ) . Recently , in an experimental model , it has been shown that FGFR2b can reduce tumour growth ( Matsubara et al . , 1998 ) . Thus , E - cadherin and FGFR2b are two character - istic epithelial components which have tumour suppressor activities and are down - regulated during * Correspondence : F Radvanyi Received 4 August 1998 ; revised 11 March 1999 ; accepted 10 May 1999 Oncogene ( 1999 ) 18 , 5722 – 5726 ª 1999 Stockton Press All rights reserved 0950 – 9232 / 99 $ 15 . 00 http : / / www . stockton - press . co . uk / onc tumour progression in bladder carcinomas . It was therefore of interest to determine whether there is a relationship between the down - regulation of FGFR2b and E - cadherin in bladder tumours . The demonstra - tion , in this report , of a high correlation between mRNA and protein expression for E - cadherin as previously shown for FGFR2b , enabled us to compare the expression of these two molecules at the mRNA level . Results and discussion Forty samples were available for comparison of E - cadherin immunoreactivity and E - cadherin mRNA expression as assessed by semi - quantitative RT – PCR . Figure 1a shows the expression of E - cadherin mRNA in normal urothelium , and in bladder carcinomas which were divided into three groups , on the basis of normal , heterogeneous or no immunoreactivity for E - cadherin ( Figure 1b ) . In general , low relative amounts of E - cadherin mRNA were observed in the samples with no immunoreactivity for E - cadherin , similar E - cadherin mRNA amounts to those observed in normal urothelial specimens were found in samples with normal immunoreactivity for E - cadherin , whereas intermediate amounts of E - cadherin mRNA were observed in samples with heterogeneous labelling with HECD - 1 . The mean E - cadherin mRNA amounts in the three di(cid:128)erent TCC groups di(cid:128)ered signiﬁcantly ( Kruskal - Wallis , non - parametric ANOVA test P = 0 . 0003 ) . This suggests that the decreased immuno - reactivity of E - cadherin observed in TCC is mainly due to a decrease in the relative amount of E - cadherin mRNA . In order to see if there was a relationship between E - cadherin and FGFR2b expression in bladder carcino - mas , the values for E - cadherin mRNA were plotted against those for FGFR2b mRNA in a series of 92 transitional cell carcinoma ( TCC ) of the bladder and four lymph node metastases ( Figure 2 ) . No linear correlation was found between these two parameters . The dotted line in Figure 2 separates the samples with high or normal amounts of E - cadherin mRNA from the samples with low E - cadherin mRNA , whereas the dashed line separates the samples with high or normal amounts of FGFR2b mRNA from the samples with low amounts of FGFR2b mRNA ( see legend of Figure 2 ) . There were 67 samples with normal or high E - cadherin and FGFR2b mRNA , 11 samples with normal or high E - cadherin mRNA and low FGFR2b , 18 samples with both low E - cadherin and FGFR2b , but , remarkably , no samples with low E - cadherin mRNA and normal or high FGFR2b . In other words , all the samples with low amounts of E - cadherin mRNA also contained low amounts of FGFR2b mRNA . The same relationship was found if , instead of TBP , GAPDH was used as an internal control for the determination of E - cadherin and FGFR2b mRNA by semi - quantitative RT – PCR ( data not shown ) . There was a signiﬁcant trend ( P = 0 . 03 , Chi - squared test ) for association of E - cadherin and FGFR2b negative tumours with high grade ( Table 1a ) and there was a signiﬁcant association ( P = 0 . 05 , Fisher’s exact test ) for association of E - cadherin and FGFR2b negative tumours with muscle invasive TCCs ( Table 1b ) . Lymph node metastases were obtained from three patients with primary tumours that expressed normal to high amounts of E - cadherin and FGFR2b . In one patient , neither E - cadherin nor FGFR2b was expressed in either of the two metastatic samples studied . In the other two patients , the metastases retained expression of both markers at an equivalent level to the primary tumour . Figure 1 Correlation between E - cadherin mRNA expression and E - cadherin immunoreactivity in bladder carcinomas . ( a ) Mean mRNA expression in normal urothelium and in bladder tumours with normal ( 1 ) , heterogeneous ( 2 ) and negative ( 3 ) immunohis - tochemical staining for E - cadherin . Relative expression of E - cadherin mRNA was assessed by semi - quantitative RT – PCR using TBP as an internal standard . RNA was extracted on a cesium chloride cushion and the amount of E - cadherin mRNA was determined by semi - quantitative RT – PCR , by comparison with an internal control , an ubiquitous transcription factor TBP ( or GAPDH , data not shown ) ( Radvanyi et al . , 1993 ; Gil Diez de Medina et al . , 1997 ) . Twenty two cycles were used for the coampliﬁcation of E - cadherin and TBP . The primer sequences of FGFR2b , GAPDH , TBP are as described by Gil Diez de Medina et al . ( 1997 ) , the primer sequences of E - cadherin are : GACCAAGTGACCACCTTAGA and GCAGGAATTTG - CAATCCTGCT ( 5 ’ to 3 ’ direction ) . After gel electrophoresis , the PCR - ampliﬁed products were quantiﬁed with a Molecular Dynamics 300 PhosphorImager ( Sunnyvale , CA , USA ) . ( b ) Evaluation of E - cadherin expression by immunohistochemistry used a classiﬁcation derived from the works of Shiozaki et al . ( 1991 ) and Bringuier et al . ( 1993 ) , in which tumours were classiﬁed as normal if the staining was similar to that of normal urothelium ( 1 ) abnormal if it was heterogeneous when tumours were composed of positive and negative areas ( 2 ) or negative if no E - cadherin immunoreactivity was observed ( 3 ) an example of tumours of each group is given . Five m m thick frozen sections from these 40 bladder tumours and ﬁve normal bladder specimens were ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde and analysed using mouse monoclonal antibody HECD - 1 against E - cadherin ( Takara Biomedical , Kyoto , Japan ) at a 1 / 150 dilution and a standard avidin - biotin immunoperoxidase detection system ( Vectastain Elite ABC kit , Vector Laboratories , Burlingame , USA ) E - cadherin and FGFR2b in bladder carcinomas S Gil - Diez de Medina et al 5723 It was of interest to determine if the relationship found between E - cadherin and FGFR2b expression in vivo was maintained in cell lines . We therefore examined the expression of E - cadherin and FGFR2b transcripts in 20 bladder cancer cell lines and one normal urothelial cell line ( Southgate et al . , 1994 ) . Figure 3 shows that , as observed with carcinoma samples , there were no bladder cell lines which contained normal or high levels of FGFR2b and low levels of E - cadherin mRNA . Thus , the relationship between E - cadherin and FGFR2b mRNA pertained to both tumour specimens and cell lines . To test the generality of these results , we also compared the level of E - cadherin and FGFR2b mRNA in a series of ten colon cancer cell lines . As observed with TCC samples and derived cell lines , there were no colon cancer cell lines with normal or high expression of FGFR2b mRNA but low E - cadherin mRNA ( Figure 3 ) . Evidence has accumulated that inactivation of E - cadherin plays a key role in cancer invasion and metastasis . Immunohistochemical examination of clin - ical tumour specimens of many di(cid:128)erent carcinomas has shown that E - cadherin expression is decreased in advanced cancer and that decreased E - cadherin expression is associated with a poor prognosis . In several cases ( papillary thyroid , head and neck and colorectal cancer ) , E - cadherin immunohistochemistry was shown to be correlated with mRNA expression ( Giroldi et al . , 1994 ) . Our present study shows a good correlation between immunohistochemistry and mRNA in bladder cancer as well , suggesting that the decrease in E - cadherin immunoreactivity results primarily from Figure 2 Relationship between E - cadherin and FGFR2b mRNA in bladder tumours . E - cadherin and FGFR2b mRNA levels were assessed in 92 TCC tumours and four lymph node metastases by semi - quantitative RT – PCR using TBP as an internal standard ( see legend of Figure 1 and Gil Diez de Medina et al . , 1997 ) . E - cadherin mRNA levels were plotted against FGFR2b mRNA levels . The dotted ( or dashed lines ) separate the tumours with low level of E - cadherin ( or FGFR2b ) with the tumours with normal or high levels . These limits were deﬁned for FGFR2b in Gil Diez de Medina et al . ( 1997 ) and for E - cadherin in Popov et al . ( submitted ) , and correspond to 30 % of the average values found in normal urothelium . These values corresponded to the tercile of the population for FGFR2b and to the quintile of the population for E - cadherin . The TCCs consisted of 11 Ta , 35 T1 , 12 T2 , 20 T3 , 13 T4 and one of unknown stage ; 16 tumours were grade G1 , 36 grade G2 and 40 grade G3 . The patients’ age at diagnosis was in the range of 29 – 90 years , with a median age of 65 . 5 years . The bladder tissue was surgically removed by transurethral resection for superﬁcial TCCs and by radical cystectomy for muscle invasive tumours . Metastases were removed by lymph node dissection . Normal urothelial specimens ( n = 5 ) were taken from normal bladder as described in Gil Diez de Medina et al . ( 1997 ) Figure 3 Relationship between E - cadherin and FGFR2b mRNA in bladder and colon cell lines . E - cadherin mRNA levels were plotted against FGFR2b mRNA levels . E - cadherin and FGFR2b mRNA levels were measured in 20 cancer bladder cell lines ( circles ) , in one normal urothelial cell line ( square ) and in ten colon cancer cell lines ( triangles ) by semi - quantitative RT – PCR ( see Figure 1 ) . The dotted and dashed lines were as deﬁned in Figure 2 . The bladder cancer cell lines ( 253J , 647V , EJ , EJ138 , HCV - 29 , HT - 1197 , HT - 1376 , J82 , JON53 , RT4 , RT112 , SCaBER , SD48 , T24 , TCC SUP , UM - UC3 , VM - CUB - 1 , VM - CUB - 3 , R - 20 and 1207 ) , the normal urothelial cell line ( NHU469 ) and the colon cancer cell lines ( COLO - 205 , COLO - 320DM , DLD - 1 , HT - 29 , LoVo , SW - 480 , SW - 620 , SW - 948 , SW - 1417 , WIDr ) were obtained from originators’ laboratories or from the ATCC . The R - 20 and 1207 bladder tumour cell lines were obtained from B Muscatelli and W de Boer ( Henri Mondor Hospital , Cre´teil , France ) . Cell lines 1207 , J82 and JON53 were grown in DMEM / Ham’s F12 adjusted to pH 7 . 2 and supple - mented with 10 % foetal bovine serum ( FBS ) , 1 m g / ml insulin , 5 n M sodium selenite , 10 m M HEPES , 50 n M 4 - hydrocortisone - 21 hemisuccinate , 5 m g / ml transferrin , 2 m M L - glutamine , 100 UI penicillin , 100 m g / ml streptomycin ; all the other bladder cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10 % FBS and antibiotics . The colon cell lines were grown in RPMI supplemented with 10 % FBS and antibiotics . At 80 % conﬂuency , cells were washed with cold PBS and lysed in 4 ml of 4 M guanidium isothiocyanate and 0 . 1 M b - mercaptoethanol in 25 m M sodium citrate pH 7 . 0 per 75 cm 2 ﬂask . The plates were agitated for at least 1 h , the lysate collected and frozen at 7 20 8 C until RNA extraction Table 1 ( a ) FGFR2b and E - cadherin mRNA expression and grade of the primary TCCs FGFR2b + / E - cadherin + FGFR2b 7 / E - cadherin + FGFR2b 7 / E - cadherin 7 G1G2G3 112528 552 0610 ( b ) FGFR2b and E - cadherin mRNA expression and stage Superﬁcial TCCs ( 4 T1 ) Muscle invasive TCCs ( 5 T2 ) 3431 83 411 The tumor samples analysed in Figure 2 were grouped according to their grade ( a ) and stage ( b ) . + ( or 7 ) for mRNA expression higher ( or lower ) than 30 % of the average value found in normal urothelium ( see the legend of Figure 2 ) E - cadherin and FGFR2b in bladder carcinomas S Gil - Diez de Medina et al 5724 reduced mRNA expression , although we cannot rule out other additional mechanisms such as post translational mechanisms ( proteolytic cleavage , desta - bilization of the protein due to absence of catenins or phosphorylation ) . We have recently shown that the epithelial - speciﬁc FGFR2b receptor is decreased both at the mRNA and the protein levels in a subset of bladder carcinomas . Such decreased expression is associated with poor prognosis ( Gil Diez de Medina et al . , 1997 ) . It was therefore of interest to determine whether FGFR2b and E - cadherin were down - regulated co - ordinately in bladder carcinomas . Using a reproduci - ble semi - quantitative RT – PCR method , we found that all the tumours with low E - cadherin mRNA had also low FGFR2b mRNA whereas tumours with low FGFR2b mRNA could express any amount of E - cadherin mRNA . Two models can account for the observed relationship between E - cadherin and FGFR2b expression , one of which we will call the sequential model , the other being the simultaneous model . In the sequential model , decreased expression of E - cadherin occurs only in cells with attenuated FGFR2b expression . In this case , decreased expression of FGFR2b would be the prior event . In the simultaneous model , decreased expression of FGFR2b can occur independently of decreased E - cadherin expression , but when decreased expression of E - cadherin occurs it is always accompanied by decreased expression of FGFR2b . A common mechan - ism could account for the simultaneous decreased expression of FGFR2b and E - cadherin such as those which have been proposed for decreased expression of E - cadherin : aberrant methylation of the E - cadherin promoter sequences ( Gra(cid:128) et al . , 1995 ; Yoshiura et al . , 1995 ) , loss of transactivators or chromatin rearrange - ment in the regulatory region ( Hennig et al . , 1995 ) . Another possibility would be that decreased E - cadherin expression by lowering intercellular adhesiveness could promote dedi(cid:128)erentiation , which in turn could be incompatible with normal expression of FGFR2b . To assess this hypothesis , two bladder carcinoma cell lines expressing E - cadherin ( RT112 , SD48 ) were treated with an anti - E - cadherin antibody ( Bracke et al . , 1993 ) which induced a rapid epithelial - ﬁbroblast - like transi - tion . The fact that the level of FGFR2b did not change after this treatment rules out this hypothesis ( data not shown ) . E - cadherin and FGFR2b are expressed in many epithelia . Reduced expression of E - cadherin mRNA has been reported in a number of carcinoma types and down - regulation of FGFR2b has been described not only in TCCs but also in cell lines derived from various carcinomas ( Rubin et al . , 1995 ) . Our results are intriguing as they suggest that there may be co - ordination in the transcription of E - cadherin and FGFR2b genes preventing high expression of FGFR2b when E - cadherin expression is low . As both E - cadherin and FGFR2b have tumour suppressor activities , this relationship in gene expression may contribute to tumour progression and to the develop - ment of the malignant phenotype . The existence of the same relationship in colon carcinoma cell lines suggests that it may be a more general property and may be true for other carcinomas as well . Further analyses are necessary to understand the kinetics of decreased expression of the two epithelial markers , E - cadherin and FGFR2b , and their relative importance in tumour invasion and metastasis .
