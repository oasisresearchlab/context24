COUCHMAN Department of Cell Biology , University of Alabama at Birmingham , Volker Hall 205 , Birmingham , AL 35294 - 0019 , USA •Author for correspondence Summary Matrix molecules such as fibronectin can promote cell attachment , spreading and focal adhesion formation . Although some interactions of fibronectin with cell surface receptors have now been identified , the conse - quent activation of intracellular messenger systems by cell / matrix interactions have still to be elucidated . We show here that the kinase inhibitors H7 and HA1004 reduce focal adhesion and stress fiber formation in response to fibronectin in a dose - dependent manner , and that activators of protein kinase C can promote their formation under conditions where they do not normally form . Fibroblasts spread within lh on substrata composed of fibronectin and formed focal adhesions by 3h , as monitored by interference reflection microscopy ( IRM ) and by labeling for talin , vinculin and integrin / ? , subunits . In addition , stress fibers were visible . When cells were allowed to spread for lh and then treated with kinase inhibitors H7 and HA 1004 for 2h , IRM indicated a reduction in focal adhesion formation at concen - trations where protein kinase C ( PKC ) should be inhibited . In contrast , focal adhesions formed normally at concentrations of these inhibitors where cyclic AMP - or cyclic GMP - dependent kinases should be inactivated . Inhibition of PKC , but not that of cyclic AMP - or cyclic GMP - dependent kinases , also prevented the formation of stress fibers and induced a dispersal of talin and vinculin , but not integrin / } , subunits , from small condensations present at lh . Consistent with the re - duction in focal adhesion formation when PKC was inhibited , activation of PKC by 30 minutes of treatment with phorbol esters induced focal adhesion formation in cells spread for 3h on substrata composed of the cell - binding ( RGD - containing ) fragment of fibronectin , while untreated cells or those treated with inactive phorbol esters did not form these structures . Key words : protein kinase C , fibronectin , microfilaments , integrins , focal adhesions . Introduction Adhesion of normal anchorage - dependent cells to extracellular matrix progresses through three stages : attachment , spreading , and the formation of specialized contact zones known as focal adhesions or focal contacts ( reviewed by Burridge , 1986 ; Burridge et al . 1988 ; Hynes , 1990 ; Woods and Couchman , 1988 ) . The formation of focal adhesions appears to be a corollary of growth and matrix deposition , and does not occur in highly motile cells ( Burridge , 1986 ; Burridge et al . 1988 ; Couchman and Rees , 1979 ; Woods and Couchman , 1988 ) . The first two adhesion stages are characterized by a submembraneous microfilament meshwork ; stress fiber formation occuring concomitantly with that of focal adhesions ( Couchman and Rees , 1979 ; Woods et al . 1986 ) . The final stage includes the concentration of microfilament proteins such as actin , myosin and alpha - actinin into focal adhesions , together with specific cytoplasmic plaque components such as vinculin ( Bur - ridge and Feramisco , 1980 ; Geiger , 1979 ) and talin ( Burridge and Connell , 1983 ) . Membrane components , including cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans ( Woods et al . 1984 ) and integrins ( Hynes , 1990 ; Ruoslahti , 1988 ) specific for the matrix molecule promoting adhesion ( Dejana et al . 1988 ; Fath et al . 1989 ; Singer et al . 1988 ) also become concentrated in these areas . In addition , a number of other proteins including an 80 kDa protein ( Beckerle , 1986 ) , calpain II ( a Ca 2 + - dependent protease ; Beckerle et al . 1987 ) , and various oncogene products ( reviewed by Burridge , 1986 ; Burridge et al . 1988 ; Turner and Burridge , 1991 ; Woods and Couchman , 1988 ) appear to be concen - trated in focal adhesions , and protein kinase C ( PKC ) type 3 has also been detected in these areas in some cells ( Jaken et al . 1989 ) . A variety of matrix ligands , including fibronectin , can induce focal adhesion formation without de novo protein synthesis when coated on a substratum ( reviewed by Burridge , 1986 ; Burridge et al . 1988 ; Couchman et al . 1983 ; Singer et al . 1987 , 1988 ; Woods and Couchman , 1988 ; Woods et al . 1986 ) . Thus , rearrangements of pre - existing components can occur , presumably in response to stimulation of intracellular 278 A . Woods and J . R . Couchman messenger systems through interactions of cell surface receptors with matrix components . Many matrix mol - ecules are multidomain , with several specific interaction sites providing the opportunity for multiple signalling to modulate cell behavior . Our previous studies ( Woods et al . 1986 ) indicated that two " signals " are needed from fibronectin to promote all three stages of adhesion in primary strains of embryonic fibroblasts . One , through cell surface integrins binding to the Arg - Gly - Asp ( RGD ) sequence of the " celF ' - binding domain ( Pierschbacher et al . 1981 ) , appeared to promote attachment and spreading to a locomotory phenotype . A second signal , which could be provided by interac - tions of cells with the heparin - binding activities , appeared to be additionally needed for the formation of focal adhesions and stress fibers . The membrane components mediating this latter signal are not known although evidence indicates they may be cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans ( Couchman et al . 1988 ; Lark and Culp , 1984 ; LeBaron et al . 1988 ; Woods et al . 1986 ) . It is still not clear how focal adhesions form , although talin and alpha - actinin can interact with some forms of integrin ( Horwitz et al . 1986 ; Otey et al . 1990 ) , and vinculin and talin may also interact with each other ( Burridge and Mangeat , 1984 ) . PKC ( Beckerle , 1990 ; Freed et al . 1989 ; Gladwin et al . 1990 ; Ikebe et al . 1985 ; Kawamoto and Hidaka , 1984a ; Kawamoto et al . 1989 ; Kikkawa et al . 1989 ; Litchfield and Ball , 1986 ; Shaw et al . 1990 ; Takai et al . 1979 ; Turner et al . 1989 ; Werth et al . 1983 ) , tyrosine kinases ( DeClue and Martin , 1987 ; Tapley et al . 1989 ) , cyclic AMP - dependent kinases ( Lamb et al . 1988 ; Turner et al . 1989 ) , and myosin light chain kinase ( Bayley and Rees , 1986 ; Lamb et al . 1988 ) are all known to phosphorylate cytoskeletal and membrane components involved in adhesion processes ( see also reviews by Burridge , 1986 ; Burridge et al . 1988 ; Hynes , 1990 ; Turner and Burridge , 1991 ; Woods and Couchman , 1988 ) . Phosphorylation and dephos - phorylation events may , therefore , be crucial to cellular morphology and cell / matrix interactions . We have here used both synthetic inhibitors of protein kinases and specific activation of PKC by phorbol ester treatment to investigate the role of phosphorylation by PKC or cyclic AMP - and cyclic GMP - dependent kinases in the stimulation of focal adhesion formation in fibroblasts by fibronectin . H7 and HA1004 are structurally similar kinase inhibitors that freely permeate cells and have similar inhibitory effects on kinases both in vivo and in vitro ( Asano and Hidaka , 1984 ; Hidaka et al . 1984 ; Kawamoto and Hidaka , 1984b ; DiCorleto and de la Motte , 1989 ; Jiang et al . 1990 ) . They differ , however , in their inhibitory effects on specific kinases ( Asano and Hidaka , 1984 ; Hidaka et al . 1984 ) . H7 inhibits cyclic AMP - and cyclic GMP - dependent kinases at levels similar to those needed to inhibit PKC , while HA1004 at low concen - tration is less effective an inhibitor of PKC than the other kinases . To dissociate the effects of kinase inhibition on cytoskeletal reorganizations specifically involved in focal adhesion and stress fiber formation , rather than any possible kinase effects on attachment or spreading , we allowed cells to spread for lh on fibronectin prior to addition of H7 or HA1004 . Monitoring focal adhesion formation over the following 2h indicated that inhibition of PKC , but not cyclic AMP - or cyclic GMP - dependent kinases , can prevent focal adhesion formation . In addition , treatment of cells spread , but lacking focal adhesions , on substrata of " celT ' - binding fibronectin fragments with phorbol myr - istyl acetate ( PMA ) or 4 - beta - phorbol 12 , 13 - dideca - noate ( PDDa ) , which both activate PKC , promoted focal adhesion formation . The inactive analogue , 4 - alpha - phorbol 12 , 13 - didecanoate ( PDDi ) , was ineffec - tive , indicating that a cellular signal for focal adhesion formation may be through activation of PKC . Materials and methods Reagents and immunochemicals Glutaraldehyde ( EM grade ) , PMA , PDDa , PDDi and general chemicals were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co . , St . Louis , MO . PMA , PDDa and PDDi were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide at lmM and stored at - 20°C . H7 and HA1004 ( Seikagaku America Inc . , St . Petersburg , FL ) were stored in phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) at 4°C . Alpha Modification ( MEM ) and Dulbecco ' s Modification of Eagle ' s Minimum Essential Medium were from Mediatech ( Wash - ington , DC ) ; fetal bovine serum , trypsin / EDTA , glutamine and 24 - well culture plates ( Linbro ) were all from Flow Laboratories Inc . , McLean , VA . Rhodamine - conjugated phalloidin ( Molecular Probes Inc . , Eugene , OR ) was diluted 1 : 100 in PBS . All antibodies were diluted in PBS . For all experiments except double labeling , affinity - purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies against integrin ft subunits ( Hedin et al . 1989 ; a gift from Dr . S . Johansson , University of Uppsala , Sweden and used at 10 / < g / ml final concentration ) , or rabbit anti - vinculin ( Calbiochem Corp . , San Diego ) diluted 1 : 10 were used . For double labeling , mouse monoclonal anti - vinculin ( Sigma ) or mouse monoclonal antibodies against integrin ft subunits ( Adeza Biomedical , Sunnyvale , CA ) were diluted 1 : 25 and 1 : 5 , respectively . Despite all attempts , these did not label as intensely as the polyclonal antibodies , possible due to limited epitope recognition . Rabbit antiserum recognizing mammalian talin ( 1 : 100 dilution ) was a generous gift from Dr . K . Burridge , University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , NC . TRITC - conjugated goat anti - rabbit IgG F ( ab ' ) 2 and FTTC - conjugated goat anti - mouse IgG F ( ab ' ) 2 ( Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories , Avondale , PA ) were diluted 1 : 50 . Cell culture and focal adhesion assays Human ( Woods et al . 1986 ) and rat embryo ( Badley et al . 1978 , 1981 ) fibroblasts , and human gingival fibroblasts ( a gift from Dr . C . Prince , University of Alabama at Birmingham ) were kept as frozen stocks in liquid nitrogen . Once thawed , they were confirmed to be mycoplasma - free by Hoechst 33257 staining . Human and rat embryo cells were grown in MEM with 5 % fetal bovine serum , and gingival fibroblasts in Dulbecco ' s Modification of Eagle ' s Medium containing 10 % serum . They were used at passage 2 - 5 , 2 - 12 or 2 - 7 from frozen , respectively . Ninety per cent confluent cultures were treated with cycloheximide ( 25 ^ g / ml ) for 2 h before sus - pension , washing , and plating onto glass coverslips precoated with either fibronectin or the 105 kDa RGD - containing PKC and focal adhesion formation 279 " celP ' - binding fragment of fibronectin , as previously de - scribed ( Couchman et al . 1983 ; Woods et al . 1986 , 1988 ) . Numbers of cells used / well were approx . 1 . 7 , 2 . 0 and 3 . 0 ( xlO 4 ) human embryo , human gingival , and rat embryo cells , respectively . This provided a sparse culture with little cell to cell contact . Cycloheximide ( 25 / ig / ml ) was present through - out the experiments . Human embryo fibroblasts were used in all assays unless otherwise stated , and were incubated in 500 / d / well MEM in the absence of serum , at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 10 % CO 2 . To test the effect of H7 or HA1004 on focal adhesion formation , these were added to cells spread for lh on fibronectin substrata . To test the effect of phorbol esters , these were added to cells prespread for 2 . 5h on substrata coated with the 105 kDa fibronectin fragment . Cells were fixed after a total of 3 h with 3 . 0 % glutaraldehyde for interference reflection microscopy ( IRM ; Bereiter - Hahn et al . 1979 ; Izzard and Lochner , 1976 , 1980 ; Woods et al . 1986 ) . Fluorescent labeling was performed on cells fixed with 3 . 5 % freshly prepared paraformaldehyde , except for microtubule labeling where fixation was with 1 % glutaraldehyde ( Badley et al . 1978 , 1980 ; Woods et al . 1986 , 1988 ) . Permeabilization , staining and mounting procedures were as previously de - scribed ( Badley et al . 1978 , 1980 ; Woods et al . 1986 , 1988 ) , except that the primary antibodies were incubated with the cells for 16 h at 4°C to increase labeling . Double labeling was performed by simultaneous incubation with both primary antibodies followed by both secondary antibodies . Controls included the use of both secondary antibodies after only one primary , use of inappropriate secondary antibody , and incubation with second antibodies only . No breakthrough of FITC to the TRITC image , or vice versa , was noted at the concentrations used . Cells were viewed on a Nikon Optiphot microscope equipped with epifluorescence , phase - contrast and IRM optics , and photographed on Ilford HP5 film . Substratum preparation Fibronectin was isolated from fresh bovine plasma on a gelatin - Sepharose column ( Miekka et al . 1982 ) and eluted with 20 mM citrate , pH 5 . 8 , 3 M urea . The 105 kDa " cell " - binding fibronectin fragment was prepared by chymotrypsin digestion as previously described ( Woods et al . 1986 , 1988 ) . SDS - PAGE analysis indicated homogeneity by the criterion of a single band after silver staining , and immunoblotting with antibodies specific for the " cell " - , gelatin - , or either the N - terminal 29 kDa or more C - terminal 31 kDa heparin - binding fragments ( Woods et al . 1988 ) , confirmed the absence of inappropriate fragments ( not shown ) . When fragments of human plasma fibronectin were used to allow comparison with previously published data ( Woods et al . 1986 , 1988 ) , no differences were seen . Glass coverslips ( 12 mm diam ; Fisher , Atlanta , GA ) were coated with fibronectin by adsorption of protein ( 1 h at 22°C ) from 100 / il of 100 ^ g / ml fibronectin in PBS . Coverslips were coated with 105 kDa fragments by drying 5 ng of protein from 70 jil PBS onto them , followed by rehydration with distilled water . Coverslips were washed , transferred to 24 - well plates , and blocked with 1 mg / ml heat - denatured bovine serum albumin in PBS as previously described ( Couchman et al . 1983 ; Woods et al . 1986 ) . Determination of percentage of cells with focal adhesions visible by IRM or by labeling with antibodies against vinculin , talin or integrin ft subunits At least 100 cells / coverslip of duplicate coverslips per treatment were monitored by IRM for the presence of focal adhesions in each experiment ( Couchman et al . 1983 ; Woods et al . 1986 ) , using random fields moving from top to bottom of the coverslip . Where large variation was found ( e . g . at intermediate concentrations of PKC inhibitors or active phorbol esters where between 70 % and 20 % of total cells had focal adhesions ) , the number of cells counted was increased to 500 / coverslip . These were counted in batches of 100 to enable a mean to be computed , using direct movement on a grid system to reduce possible recounting of the same cells . Other coverslips were monitored by immunofluorescence mi - croscopy for the percentage of cells showing labeling in discrete focal adhesion - like cell - substratum areas for vinculin , talin or integrin / 3i subunits . The criteria here for focal adhesion - like structures was size , morphology , and the pattern of distribution ( described in Results ) . Again , at least 100 cells on each of duplicate coverslips were counted . Experiments monitoring the effects of inhibitors on focal adhesion components were repeated at least twice , whereas those monitoring the effects of PKC activators were repeated four times , since they were more variable from experiment to experiment . Results Status of cells prior to addition of kinase inhibitors When cycloheximide - treated human embryo fibroblasts were allowed to adhere for lh to fibronectin substrata in the absence of serum , they appeared fully spread but IRM indicated that only a minority of them ( range of 8 - 25 % in 4 separate experiments ) had formed large discrete focal adhesions . Most cells had an IRM image similar to Fig . 1A , and lacked discrete black streaks indicative of focal adhesions ( cf . Fig . 2A ) . However , labeling with rabbit anti - talin consistently gave a pattern resembling that of small focal adhesions ( Fig . 1B , E ) in 83 - 90 % of cells . Vinculin staining was more variable with rabbit anti - vinculin labeling either dif - fusely ( not shown ) or as small condensations ( Fig . 1C ) in most cells , with a range of 5 - 41 % of cells showing label consistent with focal adhesion formation in four experiments . Cells labeled with rabbit antibodies against integTin ft subunits ( Fig . ID ) appeared similar to those labeled with anti - talin , with small focal adhesion - like structures in 80 - 85 % of the cells . Since the percentages of cells with focal adhesions appeared lower when monitored by vinculin labeling and IRM , than by labeling for talin or integrin ft subunits , we performed double labeling to determine if cells after lh of spreading on fibronectin contain predominantly focal adhesion precursors where talin and integrin copatch , but the addition of other components such as vinculin is not yet complete . Talin ( Fig . IE ) and integrin ft subunits ( Fig . IF ) appeared to be codistributed even in the smallest condensations seen , but vinculin was detected only in the larger condensations of talin ( not shown ) . Prevention of focal adhesion formation in cells plated on fibronectin by treatment with kinase inhibitors When similarly treated fibroblasts were allowed to spread on fibronectin substrata for 3h , IRM showed that the majority of them formed focal adhesions . 280 A . Woods and J . R . Couchman Fig . 1 . IRM image ( A ) and distributions of talin ( B , E ) , vinculin ( C ) and integrin ft subunits ( D , F ) in cells spread for lh on fibronectin substrata . Labeling was with polyclonal antibodies except in E , F , which are double labeled with rabbit anti - talin ( E ) and monoclonal anti - integrin ft ( F ) . Arrows in E , F indicate codistribution of label . Bar , 10 nm . Typically , 90 - 95 % of spread cells had an IRM pattern similar to that in Fig . 2A , with discrete and character - istic black adhesions present within a light grey background . This type of IRM image has been described previously for cells on a variety of substrata ( Couchman et al . 1983 ; Izzard and Lochner , 1976 , 1980 ; Woods and Couchman , 1988 ; Woods et al . 1986 ) . Fig . 2 . IRM images of human embryo fibroblasts spread for 3 h on fibronectin substrata . Cells were untreated ( A ) , or treated with 20 pM H7 ( B ) , 20 ( M HA1004 ( C ) , or 80 fM HA1004 ( D ) after 1 h spreading . Bar , 10 / . tm . Addition of H7 at 20 fM after 1 h of spreading reduced the percentage of cells with focal adhesions and resulted in an IRM image ( Fig . 2B ) characterized by a largely uniform light greyness merging to white at cell edges where ruffling was evident by phase - contrast mi - croscopy ( not shown ) . The reduction in focal adhesion formation after treatment with H7 was dose - dependent ( Fig . 3 ) , with maximal effect at 20 / M , which was therefore used in later experiments to monitor the distribution of cytoskeletal components . Despite the obvious phenotypic changes in morphology , no change in spread cell area was evident at this concentration ( not shown ) , and approx . 93 % of cells remained spread , a similar value to that of control cells ( approx . 94 % ) . In contrast to the effect of 20 ^ M H7 , when cells were treated with 20 fM HA1004 kinase inhibitor , the IRM image indicated the fonnation of focal adhesions ( Fig . 2C ) in the majority of cells . No major reduction in the percentage of spread cells having focal adhesions was noted until the concentration of HA1004 reached approximately 40 fM ( Fig . 3 ) , and complete inhibition was never achieved . This could be due to subpopu - lations of cells remaining spread on the coverslips at high concentrations of HA1004 , since some cell round - PKC and focal adhesion formation 281 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 Concentration Fig . 3 . Decrease in the percentages of cells with focal adhesions visible by IRM after 3 h of spreading on fibronectin substrata by treatment with H7 ( open circles ) or HA1004 ( filled circles ) at 1 h . s . e . m . were calculated for each point but are only indicated where large enough to be discernable ; 92 . 5 ± 0 . 5 % of control cells had focal adhesions . ing ( approx . 10 % above control levels ) and detachment was noted at concentrations greater than 100 / xM of inhibitor . At 20 JIM , H7 should inhibit cyclic AMP - and cyclic GMP - dependent kinases , and PKC ( K { = 3 . 0 , 5 . 8 and 6 . 0 fjM , respectively ) , whereas HA1004 at the same concentration should inhibit the former kinases with minimal effects on PKC ( K - , = 2 . 3 , 1 . 3 and 40 ^ M ; Asano and Hidaka , 1984 ; Hidaka et al . 1984 ; and manufacturer ' s information ) . Thus their differential effects on focal adhesion formation at 20 ^ M indicated that PKC , rather than cyclic AMP - or cyclic GMP - dependent kinases may play a major role in focal adhesion formation . This was confirmed by the finding that focal adhesion formation was reduced at higher concentrations of HA1004 , where PKC , in addition to the other kinases , should be inhibited . HA1004 was , therefore , used in further experiments to compare the distributions of focal adhesion components at concen - trations where PKC would be active ( 20 / M ) or inactive ( 80 JIM ) , but minimal effects on cell rounding were observed . Effect of inhibitors on the distribution of focal adhesion components Typical labeling of fibroblasts spread for 3 h on fibronectin with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against talin , vinculin and integrin ft subunits are shown in Fig . 4 . Talin ( Fig . 4A ) and vinculin ( Fig . 4B ) were seen as large , discrete streaks at the cell / substratum interface . Similar distributions of talin and vinculin have been shown previously to correlate with focal adhesions ( Burridge and Connell , 1983 ; Burridge and Feramisco , 1980 ; Geiger , 1979 ) . Labeling for the ft integrin subunit ( Fig . 4C ) showed a similar pattern of streaks , resem - bling the IRM pattern and that of talin . Labeling of F - actin with rhodamine - phalloidin confirmed the pres - ence of stress fibers running through the spread cells , with little general submembraneous stain ( Fig . 4D ) . The labeling for talin was altered in cells spread on fibronectin when they were treated with kinase inhibi - tors at concentrations where PKC should be inactivated ( Fig . 4E , M ) . Talin in cells treated with H7 ( Fig . 4E ) , or with 80 LM HA1004 ( Fig . 4M ) , appeared to be much more diffuse , and lacked large , focal adhesion - like streaks , with only small , or no , condensations being present . In cells treated with the lower concentration ( 20 ^ M ) of HA1004 , focal adhesion - like staining , similar to that of untreated controls , predominated in most of the spread cells ( Fig . 41 ) . Vinculin labeling also appeared to differ from normal ( Fig . 4B ) when cells were treated with H7 ( Fig . 4F ) or the higher concen - tration of HA1004 ( Fig . 4N ) , but resembled that of normal cells more at the lower concentration of HA1004 ( Fig . 4J ) . In contrast , the distribution of integrin ft subunits in cells spread on fibronectin and treated with either H7 at 20 / xM , or H1004 at 20 JUM or 80 nM ( Fig . 4G , K , O ) , was similar to that of control cells ( Fig . 4C ) . The percentages of spread cells having IRM images characteristic of focal adhesions and those with focal adhesion - like labeling for talin , vinculin and integrin ft subunits are shown in Fig . 5 . Cells having IRM patterns similar to those in Fig . 2A , C were scored as positive , whereas those similar to Fig . 2B , D were counted as negative . It was noted that very few cells showed an intermediate pattern , i . e . with a few focal adhesions only in parts of the cell . To classify the labeling patterns for talin , vinculin and integrin ft subunits , those patterns similar to Fig . 4A - C were counted as positive for focal adhesions , whereas those with only diffuse labeling ( e . g . Fig . 3E , F , M , N ) or only small conden - sations were scored as negative . Again , it was extremely unusual to find cells with an intermediate staining pattern , or to find focal adhesion - like condensations in only small parts of the cell . Results from two separate experiments ( I and II ) are shown to illustrate the consistent effects of the inhibitors on the IRM image . Under conditions where PKC was expected to be inhibited ( denoted by — in Fig . 5 ) , focal adhesion formation was seen to be reduced by both IRM and labeling for talin or vinculin . In contrast , no changes were noted in integrin ft subunit distribution when cells were treated with kinase inhibitors . The effect of the inhibitors was reversible , with 75 - 85 % of the spread cells forming focal adhesions visible by IRM within 2 h of removal of either H7 or HA1004 . Effect of inhibitors on microfilament , microtubule and 10 nm filament systems Since treatment of cells spread on fibronectin with the kinase inhibitors appeared to indicate a need for PKC activity in the formation of focal adhesions , and these are the termini of stress fibers ( Heath and Dunn , 1978 ) , we monitored the changes in the microfilament distri - bution with rhodamine - phalloidin . A lack of stress fibers , with concomitant increase in diffuse , submem - branous mesh - like staining , was seen when cells were treated with 20 ^ M H7 ( Fig . 4H ) or 80 / M HA1004 ( Fig . 4P ) , but microfilament bundles persisted in cells 282 A .

Cells were untreated ( A - D ) , or treated after 1 h spreading with 20 / M H7 ( E - H ) , or 20 lM ( I - L ) or 80 fM ( M - P ) HA1004 , and were labeled with polyclonal antibodies or rhodamine - phalloidin .

Values are the means from duplicate coverslips and two experiments ( I , II ) are shown to illustrate consistency in effect of kinase inhibition on IRM image . treated with 20 [ M HA1004 ( Fig . 4L ) . The effects of PKC inhibition on the stress fiber system of the cells appeared to be specific , with no detectable effects on the microtubule or 10 nm filament distributions . Control cultures showed the typical networks of both microtubules and vimentin filaments ( Badley et al . 1980 ) , and these were not qualitatively altered by treatment with H7 or either concentration of HA1004 ( not shown ) . Effect of inhibitors on long - term focal adhesions Since focal adhesion formation appeared susceptible to PKC inhibition , we next tested whether long - term focal adhesions were susceptible to disruption by PKC inhibition . Human embryo fibroblasts grown for 3 days in culture did not appear to change morphology when treated for 2h with 20 [ M H7 or 80 jtM HA1004 . IRM confirmed that focal adhesions were still present in the majority of cells ( 89 % and 91 % with H7 or HA1004 , respectively ) . In addition , cells allowed to spread for 24h in the absence of cycloheximide on fibronectin did not show a reduction in focal adhesions after 2h treatment with 20 ^ M H7 or 80 / xM HA1004 in the same way as cells spread only for lh . The point at which focal adhesions become refractile to PKC inhibition is currently being studied with respect to incorporation of components into adhesions . Effect of inhibitors on other cell strains Similar effects of the kinase inhibitors H7 and HA1004 on human embryo fibroblasts were found using either rat embryo or adult human gingival fibroblasts . Focal adhesions were visible by IRM in control cells spread for 3h on fibronectin substrata ( 93 % of rat cells and 90 % of gingival cells ) or those treated with 20 ( JM HA1004 ( 91 % and 84 % , respectively ) . In contrast , treatment with 20 / / M H7 at lh of spreading reduced the percentage of cells forming focal adhesions to approxi - mately 10 % , and only 17 - 22 % of cells formed these structures in the presence of 80 / xM HA1004 . Thus the effects of these kinase inhibitors does not appear to be specific for human embryo fibroblasts only . Promotion of focal adhesion formation by activators of PKC Previous studies ( Woods et al . 1986 , 1988 ) had shown that addition of heparin - binding fragments of fibronec - tin could promote focal adhesion formation in cells prespread on substrata composed of the " cell " - binding fibronectin fragment . Since the results presented above indicate that inhibition of PKC prevented focal ad - hesion formation in response to fibronectin , we next determined whether artificial activation of PKC could be sufficient to promote focal adhesion formation , in the absence of any other stimulation . Lack of focal adhesions in cells spread for 3h on substrata of 105 kDa fibronectin fragments IRM indicated an absence of focal adhesions in the majority of cells spread for 3 h on substrata coated with 105 kDa fibronectin fragments ( Fig . 6 ) . The IRM pattern ( Fig . 6A ) indicated that most cells were adhering through large close - contact areas , which give a grey image ( Izzard and Lochner , 1976 , 1980 ; Woods et al . 1986 ) , rather than discrete focal adhesions , which give blacker images surrounded by lighter areas where the membrane is less close to the substratum ( Izzard and Lochner , 1976 , 1980 ; e . g . see Fig . 2A , C ) . In addition , broad lamellae were visible towards the periphery of the majority of the spread cells ( arrowed in Fig . 6A ) . Focal adhesions were detected in 8 - 21 % of the spread cells in a total of 14 experiments , using 105 kDa fragments from bovine or human plasma fibronec - tin . As postulated previously ( Woods et al . 1986 ) , cells that form focal adhesions under these circumstances may have escaped the cycloheximide block , and synthesized and exported matrix of endogenous origin . When the distributions of talin , vinculin and integrin Pi subunits were examined in cells spread on substrata of 105 kDa fragments , the characteristic focal adhesion pattern seen on fibronectin ( Fig . 4 ) was absent in most cells . Although the organization of talin varied both within each cell population and between each exper - iment , the majority of cells ( 70 - 80 % ) were labeled diffusely as shown in Fig . 6B . Small condensations of label were sometimes visible within the diffuse label 284 A . Woods and J . R . Couchman Fig . 6 .

Bar , 10 jim . ( arrowheads in B , C ) , but only a minority of cells ( 12 - 28 % ) had larger streaks ( arrows in C ) , which are more like focal adhesions ( cf . Fig . 2 ) . The labeling for vinculin in cells spread on 105 kDa fragment substrata was also mainly diffuse ( Fig . 6D ) in the majority of cells , and only 6 - 20 % of the cells showed focal adhesion - like plaques . Staining with antibodies against integrin ft subunits resembled that with anti - talin in that most ( 70 - 80 % ) cells had only diffuse labeling or small condensations ( Fig . 6E ) , and only 15 - 28 % of cells showed focal adhesion - like streaks ( Fig . 6F ) in 14 experiments . For the purpose of scoring whether cells were positive or negative for focal adhesions , cells were considered negative if they contained diffuse label only or very small condensations ( i . e . similar to Fig . 6B , D , E ) , but positive if they contained larger conden - sations ( similar to Fig . 6C arrows , or F ) . Despite differences in fine detail of staining patterns from population to population , it was consistently found , by IRM and staining for talin , integrin ft subunits and vinculin distribution , that only a minority of cells formed focal adhesions when spread on substrata composed of only 105 kDa fibronectin fragments . Induction of focal adhesions in cells spread on substrata of 105 kDa fragments by addition of active phorbol esters Fig . 7 shows the results of treating cells prespread on substrata of the 105 kDa fibronectin fragments for 30 min with increasing concentrations of PMA , PDDa or the inactive ester PDDi . Both active phorbol esters increased the percentage of cells that had focal adhesions , as shown by IRM , to approximately 70 - 80 % , with maximal activity at 200 nM . The response of the cell population to the active esters at 100 - 200 nM was very variable , although IRM indicated that individual cells either had no focal adhesions ( Fig . 8A ) or contained many of these structures distributed through - out the cell ( Fig . 8B , C ) . Intermediates having a few adhesions in parts of the cell periphery were extremely rare . Thus , the induction of focal adhesion formation appears to be a threshold event . The inactive analogue , PDDi , only appeared to increase focal adhesion formation to around 20 % of cells , with control values ( dimethyl sulfoxide added to the same concentration ) 250 500 750 1000 1250 1500 1750 Concentration of Ester ( nM ) 2000 Fig . 7 .

Bars , s . e . m . , shown when large enough to be discernable . 8A Pi ! D y PKC and focal adhesion formation 285 a submembraneous meshwork being dominant . As with induced changes in the IRM images , the rearrangement of cytoskeletal and membrane components into focal adhesions , and the formation of stress fibers was an ' all - or - nothing ' event . The response of cells to phorbol esters was variable as shown in Fig . 10 . Although there is a range of the mean percentage of cells forming focal adhesions in individual experiments , it appears that both PMA and PDDa , but not PDDi , consistently induced the formation of focal adhesions in a majority of cells , with concomitant focal adhesion - like labeling for talin , vinculin and integrin ft subunits . Thus , the combination of signals from spreading on 105 kDa substrata and treatment with phorbol esters can promote complete adhesion of primary embryonic fibroblasts . The phorbol ester - mediated increase in focal ad - hesion formation could be prevented by pretreating the cells with kinase inhibitors H7 or HA1004 at concen - trations where PKC would be expected to be inacti - vated . In one experiment , 72 % of cells spread on substrata of 105 kDa and treated with 200 nM PMA formed focal adhesions ; 20 fM H7 or 80 , uM HA1004 reduced this to 10 . 5 % and 9 . 5 % , respectively , but 20 / M HA1004 had little effect ( 68 % of cells had focal adhesions ) . These results provide further evidence that PKC activity is needed for focal adhesion formation , and for the efficacy of the inhibitors , under the conditions used , to selectively inhibit PKC activity , and thus prevent focal adhesion formation . Fig . 8 . IRM images of cells spread on 105 kDa fibronectin fragment substrata and treated with 100 nM PMA ( A ) , 200 nM PMA ( B ) , 200 nM PDDa ( C ) , or 200 nM PDDi ( D ) . Bar , 10 nm . being 12 % in this particular experiment . Cells treated with 200 nM PDDi had IRM images similar to those of control cells with broad lamellae and no focal ad - hesions . Treatment of cells spread on substrata composed of the 105 kDa fibronectin fragments with active phorbol esters also altered the distribution of focal adhesion components and promoted stress fiber formation . Cells treated with either PMA ( Fig . 9A - D ) or PDDa ( Fig . 9E - H ) at 200 nM showed labeling for talin ( Fig . 9A , E ) , vinculin ( Fig . 9B , F ) or integrin ft subunits ( Fig . 9C , G ) in focal adhesion - like structures ( arrowed in Fig . 9 ) . In contrast , cells treated with 200 nM PDDi ( Fig . 9I - L ) had talin ( Fig . 91 ) , vinculin ( Fig . 9J ) and integrin ft subunit ( Fig . 9K ) distributions similar to those of untreated cells spread on substrata of 105 kDa fibronec - tin fragments . Treatment of cells with PMA ( Fig . 9D ) or PDDa ( Fig . 9H ) also promoted the formation of stress fibers , and focal adhesions visible by IRM correlated with their termini at the substratum ( not shown ) . The distribution of F - actin in cells treated with PDDi ( Fig . 9L ) was , however , similar to that of untreated cells on 105 kDa fragment substrata , or those treated with dimethyl sulfoxide alone ( not shown ) , with Discussion The mechanisms underlying focal adhesion formation are not yet elucidated although previous studies indicate that " signals " additional to that derived from RGD / integrin interactions are needed , at least for primary fibroblastic strains ( Woods et al . 1986 , 1988 ) . The experiments described here strongly indicate that PKC - mediated phosphorylation changes , rather than those due to cyclic AMP - or cyclic GMP - dependent kinases , may be an important signalling mechanism in focal adhesion and stress fiber formation . A variety of independent monitoring methods demonstrated that the ability of cells to form these structures was reduced by inhibitors of PKC , but promoted by activators . First , IRM showed that focal adhesions ( characterized by well - defined black streaks ) , normally present in these cells when spread on fibronectin substrata , were absent in the majority of cells if they were treated with 20 [ iM H7 or 80 , uM HA1004 to inactivate PKC and cyclic AMP - and cyclic GMP - dependent kinases . In contrast , when cells were treated with 20 / JM HA1004 , when only cyclic AMP - and cyclic GMP - dependent kinases should be inactivated , focal adhesions were seen in most cells . Second , immunofluorescent labeling for two cytoskel - etal proteins that are characteristic focal adhesion components , talin ( Burridge and Connell , 1983 ) and vinculin ( Burridge and Feramisco , 1980 ; Geiger , 1979 ) , also indicated that inhibition of PKC correlated with a 286 A .

Labeling of F - actin ( D , H , L ) shows stress fibers in D and submembraneous meshwork in L . Bar , 10 fiM . lack of focal adhesion formation . Third , labeling of F - actin with phalloidin showed that stress fibers , which normally form in cells adherent to fibronectin ( Woods et al . 1986 ) , and terminate ventrally at focal adhesions ( Heath and Dunn , 1978 ) , were absent in those cells treated with H7 or HA1004 at concentrations where PKC should be inhibited , but were present at concen - trations of HA1004 that do not inhibit PKC . In addition , although most human embryo fibroblasts were incapable of forming focal adhesions visible by IRM on substrata composed of the 105 kDa " cell " - binding fragment of fibronectin , 30 min treatment with active , but not inactive , phorbol esters promoted their formation , even in the continued presence of cyclohexi - mide . Concomitant with the change in the IRM image , treatment of cells with active phorbol esters appeared to have induced a redistribution of talin , vinculin and integrin f3 { subunits into focal adhesion - like plaques , PKC and focal adhesion formation 287 90 2 80 | 70 5 60 1 5 ° U - 40 a > | 30 | 20 o Q - 10 0 O O 8 • O • 8 * !

Percentages of cells snowing focal adhesions by IRM ( filled circles ) , or by labeling for talin ( open circles ) , vinculin ( filled triangles ) or integrin / } L subunits ( open triangles ) are shown . Values are the means of duplicate coverslips from 4 different experiments . unlike their diffuse distribution in the majority of untreated cells spread on 105 kDa substrata or those treated with inactive esters . Similar redistribution of F - actin was seen in the majority of cells treated with active phorbol esters , from a diffuse submembraneous mesh - work with peripheral fine microfilament bundles to large prominant stress fibers , whose termini correlated with focal adhesions seen by IRM . Indeed the promo - tion of stress fiber formation by phorbol ester treatment appeared to be so pronounced in many cells that the stress fibers could now be seen by IRM for some length centripetally from adhesion points , rather than just at their termini ( e . g . Fig . 8B , D ) . The exact role of PKC in the formation of focal adhesions remains to be elucidated , but the difference in distribution of focal adhesion components after 1 h of spreading on fibronectin and those in cells spread for 3 h in the absence or presence of inhibitors may be of note . After lh of spreading , IRM indicated that very few cells contained focal adhesions , and , although talin and integrin / 3j subunits appeared to be codistributed in small focal patches , vinculin appeared to be present only in the larger patches of talin . After a further 2 h of incubation in the absence of PKC inhibition , focal adhesions were consistently visible by IRM and by labeling for all three adhesion components , even under conditions where cyclic AMP - and cyclic GMP - depen - dent kinases should be inactivated ( 20 [ iM FIA1004 ) . In contrast , when cells spread for 1 h were treated with inhibitors for 2 h at concentrations sufficient to inhibit PKC ( 20 nM H7 or 80 ( M HA1004 ) , an apparent dispersal of talin , but not integrin / Jj subunits , from these small patches was noted . Concomitant with this , F - actin labeling was diffuse . These results illustrate several points . ( 1 ) IRM visualization of a focal adhesion may depend on all three ( and possibly more ) com - ponents being present in focal adhesions . Previous studies have indicated that increases in concentration of cellular components adjacent to the substratum de - crease the light reflectance ( i . e . increases blackness ) of the IRM image ( Bereiter - Hahn et al . 1979 ; Izzard and Lochner , 1976 , 1980 ) . ( 2 ) Vinculin may be a late addition during adhesion formation , in agreement with reports that patching of integrins precedes focal condensations of cytoskeletal components during cell spreading ( Dejana et al . 1988 ) , and vinculin is absent from new focal contacts in migratory cells ( DePasquale and Izzard , 1991 ) . ( 3 ) The interaction of talin with integrins may need to be stabilized by a PKC - dependent process , otherwise the talin disperses from patched integrin clusters . ( 4 ) Cytoskeletal anchoring of patched integrin / ^ subunits to talin is not necessary for their retention in focal structures . The previous observation ( Jaken et al . 1989 ) that an isoform of PKC ( type 3 ) can be a focal adhesion component in some normal fibroblasts is highly consis - tant with a role for this enzyme in their formation . In addition , the promotion of focal adhesion formation and the redistribution of all three plaque components into adhesions by short - term phorbol ester treatment also argues for a stabilization of integrin / talin interac - tions by activation of PKC . This appears similar to the case in lymphocytes , where patching of cell surface integrins by addition of antibody was accompanied by talin subpatches only if PKC was also activated ( Burn et al . 1988 ) . During fibroblast adhesion , RGD / integrin interactions may be sufficient to promote some patching at the cell surface , increasing the normally low integrin to matrix affinities ( Akiyama et al . 1985 ; Hynes , 1990 ; Ruoslahti , 1988 ) sufficiently for attachment and spread - ing , with some transient associations of talin and integrins . This may result in labile adhesion , such as is seen in motile cells , but not focal adhesion formation . The role of PKC activation may be to " stabilize " the initial associations of talin and integrin by additional interactions with vinculin and / or other cytoskeletal components to form focal adhesions . There are anal - ogous examples with T and B cells of integrin / ligand interactions being sufficient only for labile adhesion , with a requirement for additional receptor - ligand interactions , or direct activation of PKC , for stabiliz - ation leading to higher - avidity cell to cell and cell to substratum adhesion ( reviewed by O ' Rourke and Mescher , 1990 ) . Interestingly , although T - cells have cell surface integrins that bind fibronectin or laminin , they will not attach to these matrix molecules unless treated briefly with phorbol esters or antibodies to the T - cell receptor ( Shimizu et al . 1990 ) . Similar increases in the binding of C3bi to neutrophils ( where the RGD sequence interacts with the CR3 receptor ) can also be induced by phorbol ester treatment of cells that promotes a clustering of the receptors ( Detmers et al . 1987 ) . Other studies indicate that activation of PKC in monocytes and macrophages may also augment inte - grin - mediated adhesion to endothelium and laminin ( Gladwin et al . 1990 ; Shaw et al . 1990 ) . These studies , and the results shown here , appear contrary to previously published reports that stimulation of PKC with phorbol esters may disrupt stress fibers and focal adhesions ( reviewed by Burridge , 1986 ; Burridge et al . 1988 ; Hynes , 1990 ) . There are several possible expla - 288 A . Woods and J . R . Couchman nations for this . First , our experiments were performed while cells were forming focal adhesions , rather than with cells where these had already formed . Indeed , we found that long - term adhesions were more retractile to the effects of kinase inhibitors . Second , different cell types may respond differently ( Turner et al . 1989 ) and many of the previous studies used a variety of cell lines including epithelia . We have used three strains of fibroblasts here , all of which behaved similarly . The balance of activation of the different kinase systems may differ with cell type , or different locations of specific PKC isoforms ( Jaken et al . 1989 ; Leach et al . 1989 ) may result in differential phosphorylation of subsets of cytoskeletal components ( Turner et al . 1989 ) . The cellular target ( s ) responsible for responding to the PKC activation have not yet been elucidated . Known substrates for phosphorylation by PKC include filamin ( Kawamoto and Hidaka , 1984a ) , myosin light chain ( Kawamoto et al . 1989 ; Sutton and Haeberle , 1990 ) , myosin light chain kinase ( Ikebe et al . 1985 ; Nishikawa et al . 1985 ) and profilin ( Hansson et al . 1988 ) , in addition to vinculin ( Kawamoto and Hidaka , 1984a ; Turner et al . 1989 ; Werth et al . 1983 ) and talin ( Beckerle , 1990 ; Litchfield and Ball , 1986 ; Turner et al . 1989 ) . Integrin subunits a 6 ( Shaw et al . 1990 ) , glyco - protein Ilia ( Parise et al . 1990 ) , & ( Hara and Fu , 1986 ) and ( l s ( Freed et al . 1989 ) have also been shown to be PKC substrates . The membrane component ( s ) trans - ducing the signal to activate PKC has also not yet been determined . Since the binding of heparin - binding fibronectin domains to cells can promote focal adhesion formation in combination with RGD / integrin interac - tions ( Woods et al . 1986 ) , membrane proteoglycans may be involved in the signal transduction . Further evidence for this is that mutant cells with abnormal proteoglycan metabolism lack the capacity to form focal adhesions in response to fibronectin ( Couchman et al . 1988 ; LeBaron et al . 1988 ) , and cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans are found in focal adhesions and retained in detergent - resistant cytoskeletal prep - arations ( Woods et al . 1984 ) . The identity of membrane components involved in the signalling events , and of the cytoskeletal components specifically phosphorylated during focal adhesion formation , are currently under investigation .
