CML size characterization ( dried state ) We also use SEM imaging to characterize the size of CML particles used in our study , shown in Figure S1 .

Polydispersity index ( PdI ) of CML in various aqueous environments For data interpretation of DLS experiments , we used cumulant analysis based on the following equation     3 2 1 3 2 μ τ μ τ l n g τ Γ τ . . . 2 ! 3 !          ( 1 ) where g ( 1 ) ( τ ) , τ , Γ ̅ , and μ m indicate the first - order autocorrelation function , relaxation time , average decay rate , and variance respectively . We fit Eq . ( 1 ) to the experimental data and obtain Γ ̅ and µ 2 , using which we define the polydispersity index ( PdI ) as 22 P d I    ( 2 ) A smaller PdI is representative of monodisperse colloids in solution . 2 .

Additional confocal images to show colloid aggregation in Method 1 In addition to microstructural evidence of colloid aggregation in [ F ] = 1 . 6mg / mL ( Figure 4 in manuscript ) , we show colloid aggregation with a larger fibrinogen concentration , [ F ] = 6 . 4 mg / mL , ( Figure SI2 ) . Figure S2 : Confocal images showing colloid ( d = 200 nm ) aggregation and fibrinogen recruitment for 6 . 4 mg / mL fibrinogen , 1 . 5 U / mL thrombin , and ϕ = 0 . 05 % . Signals from ( a ) fibrin , ( b ) colloids ( c ) fibrin + colloids . 4 . Fibrinogen batch variation We compare colloid - fibrin composites prepared using method 1 with two batches of fibrinogen ( Figure 5 and Figure 8 in the manuscript ) . Fibrin from batch 1 has a slightly smaller elastic modulus ( Figure S3 ( a ) ) , compared to batch 2 ( Figure S3 ( b ) ) , but the ability to accommodate colloids is identical for both batches . The nonlinear properties are identical as well ( Figures SI3 ( c ) , ( d ) ) . ( b ) Figure S3 : Fibrinogen batch variation does not affect maximum accommodable colloid volume fraction and strain stiffening behavior . Shown here for d = 200 nm colloids for [ F ] = 6 . 4 mg / mL and [ T ] = 1 . 5 U / mL ; batch 1 ( a , c ) and batch 2 ( b , d ) . Results from batch 2 ( second row ) are shown in the manuscript . 5 . Evolution of elastic modulus with colloid inclusion ( Method 1 ) Figure 7 in the manuscript shows a phase diagram of successful / unsuccessful colloid - fibrin composites based on information from the elastic modulus of attained composites . Figures S4 ( a - k ) show this information for all concentrations of fibrinogen and thrombin , and colloid concentrations considered in the phase diagram . Figure S4 : Evolution of elastic modulus for d = 200 nm colloids in [ F ] = 1 . 6 mg / mL ( a - d ) ; [ F ] = 3 . 2 mg / mL ( e - g ) ; and [ F ] = 6 . 4 mg / mL ( h - k ) with varying thrombin concentration , probed at γ 0 = 1 % and ω = 1 rad / s . In all cases , black lines with larger thickness represent neat fibrin ( without colloids ) . Shaded light gray regions mark the instrument torque noise floor ( 0 . 5 μ N . m ) translating to a minimum measurable modulus of 1 . 25 Pa . 6 . Details on elemental ( C - H - N ) analysis estimates of volume fraction ( method 2 ) Table S1 shows details in arriving at volume fractions reported in Table 1 in the manuscript . To ensure reproducibility , two samples were analyzed for each exposure time . Table S1 .
