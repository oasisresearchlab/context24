But it may instead be multiple . This article investigates three respects in which there might be multiple creativities— processes , domains , and styles . It considers different potential models for multiple creativities . It concludes by suggesting that the different respects in which creativity might be multiple are complementary rather than mutually exclusive . r 2005 Elsevier Ltd . All rights reserved .

Introduction The ﬁeld of creativity was practically somnolent when Guilford ( 1950 ) woke it up more than half - a - century ago with a presidential address to the American Psychological Association . He pointed out , correctly , that there was pitifully little research on creativity relative to the importance of such research to the ﬁeld of psychology . Although his address instigated fresh research , Sternberg and Lubart ( 1996 ) argued many years later that the ﬁeld was still under - researched relative to its importance .

Today the ﬁeld has seen an explosion of interest . Indeed , there is even an Encyclopedia of Creativity ( Runco and Pritzker , 1999 ) and a Handbook of Creativity ( Sternberg , 1999a ) . Moreover , current work addresses creativity—creatively—a condition that has not always been reached . Some of the questions currently being addressed are illustrated in this special issue . Here is a sampling of the diversity of questions being addressed : 1 . What is creativity ? ( Burleson , 2005 ; Edmonds et al . , 2005 ) . 2 . How can creativity be enhanced ? ( Edmonds et al . , 2005 ; Oppenheim , 2005 ; Fischer et al . , 2005 ) . 3 . How do previous sources of information contribute to present creativity ? ( Bonnardel and Marmeche , 2005 ) . 4 . How can the environment be designed to support creativity ? ( Hewett , 2005 ; Oppenheim , 2005 ; Yamamoto and Nakakoji , 2005 ) . 5 . What are the cognitive , personality , and motivational constituents of creativity ? ( Burleson , 2005 ; Selker , 2005 ) . 6 . What is the relation of creativity to knowledge and expertise ? ( Burleson , 2005 ) . 7 . What role can technology play in understanding and enhancing creativity ? ( Bonnardel and Marmeche , 2005 ; Edmonds et al . , 2005 ; Hewett , 2005 ; Selker , 2005 ) . 8 . What is the role of social context in creativity ? ( Fischer et al . , 2005 ) . These questions , as well as many other similar questions , are often interpreted so as to assume that there is a single entity of creativity , typically deﬁned along the lines of the ability to produce ideas and / or products that are novel and useful ( see essays in Sternberg , 1999a ; Sternberg et al . , 2004 ) . But perhaps there is more than one kind of creativity . This issue of the Journal implies as much in several places and in this paper the question is addressed explicitly by posing some speciﬁc questions . Is there reason to believe that there are multiple creativities ? If there are , then what forms might they take ? In this article , I propose that there are at least three different forms multiple creativities might take : creativities with respect to processes , domains , and styles . Multiple creativities would exist if creativity was not only multi - dimensional , but multiple in nature . That is , it would exist if there is no one thing that is truly creativity , but rather , multiple things that are . 2 . Multiple creativities : processes Several models of multiple processes of creativity have been proposed . 2 . 1 . Geneplore One model of multiple processes is Geneplore ( Finke et al . , 1992 ; see also Smith et al . , 1995 ; Ward et al . , 1999 ) . According to this model , there are two main processing phases in creative thought : a generative phase and an exploratory phase . In the ARTICLE IN PRESS R . J . Sternberg / Int . J .
