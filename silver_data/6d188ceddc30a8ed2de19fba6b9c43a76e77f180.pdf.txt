In the present study , we determined serum levels of vitronectin ( VN ) in 93 breast cancer patients , 30 benign breast lesions , 9 precancerous lesions , and 30 healthy individuals by enzyme - linked immunosorbent assays . Serum VN level was significantly higher in patients with stage 0 – I primary breast cancer than in healthy individuals , patients with benign breast lesion or precancerous lesions , as well as those with breast cancer of higher stages . Serum VN level was significantly and negatively correlated with tumor size , lymph node status , and clinical stage ( p < 0 . 05 in all cases ) . In addi - tion , VN displayed higher area under curve ( AUC ) value ( 0 . 73 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) [ 0 . 62 – 0 . 84 ] ) than carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA ) ( 0 . 64 , 95 % CI [ 0 . 52 – 0 . 77 ] ) and cancer antigen 15 - 3 ( CA 15 - 3 ) ( 0 . 69 , 95 % CI [ 0 . 58 – 0 . 81 ] ) when used to distinguish stage 0 – I cancer and normal control . Importantly , the combined use of three bio - markers yielded an improvement in receiver operating char - acteristic curve with an AUC of 0 . 83 , 95 % CI [ 0 . 74 – 0 . 92 ] . Taken together , our current study showed for the first time that serum VN is a promising biomarker for early diagnosis of breast cancer when combined with CEA and CA15 - 3 . Keywords Breast cancer . Early stage . Serum . Diagnosis Introduction Breast cancer is the most common cancer in females world - wide and a main cause of cancer - related mortality [ 1 , 2 ] . Im - proved early detection and diagnosis is contributed to the re - duced breast cancer mortality . Although mammographic screening is currently the best available approach for early detection of breast cancer in women over the age of 50 years old , it has several limitations that include poor diagnostic ac - curacy in dense breast tissue and an insufficient number of screening facilities [ 3 , 4 ] . Serum biomarkers are more appeal - ing diagnostic tools due to their test simplicity , noninvasiveness , and capability of continuous patient moni - toring . However , most of the breast cancer biomarkers cur - rently used in clinical settings , including carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA ) and cancer antigen 15 - 3 ( CA15 - 3 ) , are fre - quently elevated in patients with late stage and metastatic disease and lack sensitivity in detecting primary breast cancer at an early stage [ 5 – 8 ] . None of them is used for early diag - nosis of breast cancer [ 9 ] . Therefore , it is very urgent to find serum biomarkers with high sensitivity and specificity for ef - fective early diagnosis of breast cancer . The human serum component vitronectin ( VN ) , also termed serum spreading factor and complement S - protein , is a 75 - kDa adhesive glycoprotein , which plays important roles Wende Hao , Xuhui Zhang and Bingshui Xiu contributed equally to this work . * XiaoYan Feng xyfeng2002 @ 126 . com * Yan Huang hy1963 @ 126 . com 1 Department of Breast Surgery , Affiliated 307 Hospital , 8 , Dongda Avenue , Beijing 100071 , China 2 Department of Bio - diagnosis , Institute of Basic Medical Sciences , 27 , Taiping Road , Beijing 100850 , China 3 Olympia Diagnostics , Inc . , Sunnyvale , CA 94086 , USA 4 Division of Experimental Cancer Research , Department of Laboratory Medicine in Malmö , Clinical Research Center , Lund University , 205 02 Malmö , Sweden Tumor Biol .

As a major component or master organizer of extracellular matrix ( ECM ) , VN has been found to regulate vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) - induced angio - genesis , a key step in tumor formation [ 11 ] . Importantly , VN was reported to play a key role in the development and progression of solid tumors including breast cancer [ 12 – 15 ] . VN has been shown to promote breast cancer migration and invasion [ 16 , 17 ] and participate in differen - tiation of breast cancer stem cells [ 18 ] . Moreover , several biologically active complexes of VN are known to exist in the plasma and stabilize its partner proteins , such as PAI - 1 and fibrinogen [ 19 , 20 ] . In the blood , VN circulates in a monomeric form . It consists of a mixture of a 75 - kDa polypeptide and its nicked product of 65 plus 10 kDa [ 21 ] . Notably , VN level was found to be higher in blood samples of breast cancer patients than in healthy women and may serve as a useful biomarker for the early detection of breast cancer [ 22 – 24 ] . However , a better understanding of the performance of VN alone or in combination with other clinically used biomarkers in early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer is still necessary . In this study , we investigated the relationship of serum VN level with various clinicopathologic parameters of breast can - cer and assessed the diagnostic value of VN and the other two biomarkers , CEA and CA15 - 3 . Our aim was to explore whether VN alone or in combination with the conventional breast cancer biomarkers CEA and CA15 - 3 could be used as new biomarker panels to recognize cancer cells with high sensitivity and specificity for early detection of breast cancer . Materials and methods Patients ’ data This study obtained approval from the ethics review boards in Affiliated 307 Hospital and Institute of Basic Medical Sci - ences . All patients and healthy volunteers provided written informed consent . Ninety - three breast carcinoma patients aged between 32 and 79 years old were enrolled in the study . The control groups included 30 patients with benign breast tumor , 9 with precancerous lesions and 30 healthy women . Characteristics of cancer patients and control subjects were shown in Table 1 . The diagnosis of breast cancer and benign and precancerous lesions was established by histopathological analysis of biopsy or surgical mammary tissue specimens . The breast carcinoma and benign and precancerous lesions serum samples were obtained prior to surgery or prior to any treatment . The cancer was staged according to tumor - node - metastasis ( TNM ) by the American Joint Committee on Cancer ( AJCC ) staging system . Serum collection and storage All blood samples were collected from preoperative patients and healthy individuals . The samples were allowed to clot at room temperature for at least 30 min , and then centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 3000 rpm . The serum aliquots were stored at 80 °C until assayed . VN enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay Crude sera were diluted 1 : 2000 and the diluted samples were analyzed using human vitronectin enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) kit ( MyBioSource , San Diego , USA ) according to the manufacturer ’ s instruc - tions . Natural forms of VN ( 75 kDa ) were detected in this study . Protein concentrations were determined as absorbance with the SM - 3 Microplate Reader ( Tianshi , Beijing , China ) . CEA and CA15 - 3 serum analysis Both the CEA and CA15 - 3 serum testing were performed with sandwich ELISA kits ( CanAg Diagnostics AB , Gothenburg , Sweden ) according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions . The reaction was stopped by addition of stop solution , and the resulting absorbance was measured at 405 nm with the SM - 3 Microplate Reader ( Tianshi , Beijing , China ) . All the sam - ples were assessed in duplicate . Statistical analysis The relationships between biomarkers and tumor charac - teristics were examined with the Kruskal - Wallis test and t test . Continuous variables were expressed as mean ± standard deviation ( SD ) , and categorical variables were expressed as number and percentage . Spearman ’ s rank correlation coefficient was used to assess the correla - tions among biomarkers . Nonparametric receiver operat - ing characteristic ( ROC ) curve analysis was used to ob - tain the area under curve ( AUC ) with 95 % confidence intervals of individual as well as combined biomarkers and calculate their sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing stage 0 – I patients and normal control groups . Logistic regression was used to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of the optimal combination of VN , CEA , and CA 15 - 3 . p values less than 0 . 05 were considered statistically significant for all statistical analyses . All statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS software package version 17 . 0 ( SPSS , Chica - go , IL , USA ) . 8910 Tumor Biol . ( 2016 ) 37 : 8909 – 8916 Results Clinical characteristics of the study cohort Characteristics of the total study population are shown in Ta - ble 1 . Among the 93 breast cancer patients investigated , the most frequently occurring cancer was invasive ductal carcino - ma ( 80 % ) followed by ductal carcinoma in situ ( 16 % ) . The most frequent clinical stage was stage I ( 38 % ) . Thirty - two percent of breast cancer patients were diagnosed in stage II , while only one tumor was diagnosed in stage IV . The median age of breast cancer patients was 48 years . In benign lesions , 40 % of the patients were fibroadenoma followed by adenopathy ( 33 % ) . The median age of patients with benign lesion was 37 years . Seven of nine precancerous lesions ( 78 % ) were diagnosed with intraductal papillomatosis . The median age of patients with precancerous lesion was 48 years . Measurement of serum VN level in breast cancer patients and control subjects The serum levels of VN from healthy individuals and patients with breast cancer , benign lesions , and precancerous lesions were analyzed by ELISA . The expression levels of VN in breast cancer patients at different stages and in non - cancer groups are shown in Fig . 1 . The data showed that the mean value of serum VN level was higher in stage 0 – I breast cancer patients than in normal controls , benign lesions , precancerous lesions , and patients with breast cancers of higher stages . VN level showed significant difference between stage 0 – I patients ( 310 . 98±36 . 78 μ g / ml ) and the other groups , including nor - mal controls ( 277 . 23 ± 45 . 87 μ g / ml ) ( p = 0 . 0014 ) , stage II Table 1 Characteristics of breast cancer patients and controlgroups Study group Number of patients ( % ) Breast cancer 93 Type Invasive ductal carcinoma 74 ( 80 % ) Ductal carcinoma in situ 15 ( 16 % ) Mucinous adenocarcinoma 2 ( 2 % ) Paget ’ s disease 2 ( 2 % ) Median age ( range ) 48 ( 32 – 79 ) Tumor stage 0 17 ( 18 % ) I 35 ( 38 % ) II 30 ( 32 % ) III 10 ( 11 % ) IV 1 ( 1 % ) Benign lesions 30 Type Fibroadenoma 12 ( 40 % ) Adenopathy 10 ( 33 % ) Intraductal papilloma 8 ( 27 % ) Median age ( range ) 37 ( 30 – 59 ) Precancerous lesions 9 Type Intraductal papillomatosis 7 ( 78 % ) Moderate to severe dysplasia 2 ( 22 % ) Median age ( range ) 48 ( 30 – 69 ) Normal female 30 Median age ( range ) 35 ( 30 – 65 ) Fig . 1 Scatter - plot analysis of serum VN expression .

There is no significant difference between normal control and benign breast lesion groups ( p = 0 . 1547 ) . No significant difference was found among stage II , stage III – IV , and benign breast lesion patients ( p > 0 . 05 in all cases ) . Relationship of serum VN level with clinicopathological parameters of breast cancer patients The association of VN , CA15 - 3 , and CEA with patient and clinicopathological parameters such as age , tumor size , menopausal status , lymph node status , histologic grade , es - trogen receptor ( ER ) and progesterone receptor ( PgR ) sta - tus , clinical stage , HER2 status , and Ki67 expression were examined . As shown in Table 2 , serum VN level was not associated with age , menstrual status , histological grade , ER expression , PR expression , HER2 overexpression , and Ki67 expression ( p > 0 . 05 in all cases ) . However , the de - creased VN level correlated with increased tumor size ( p = 0 . 0175 ) and clinical stage ( p = 0 . 0004 ) . Furthermore , serum VN level in lymph node - negative group was higher than in the positive group ( p = 0 . 0024 ) ( Table 2 ) . Serum VN level was significantly and negatively associated with tu - mor size , lymph node status , and clinical stage . As for CEA and CA15 - 3 , both biomarkers ’ serum concentrations were significantly higher in patients with tumor size > 2 cm than Table 2 Correlations of serum levels of tumor biomarkers with clinicopathological characteristics of preoperative breast cancer patients Characteristics Number VN ( μ g / ml ) p value CEA ( ng / ml ) p value CA15 - 3 ( U / ml ) p value Age ≤ 45 years 37 300 . 07±42 . 14 0 . 3133 7 . 45±6 . 95 0 . 0709 14 . 66±6 . 46 0 . 7799 > 45 years 56 290 . 35±42 . 15 10 . 53±9 . 05 14 . 99±6 . 42 Tumor size ≤ 2 cm 56 302 . 89±38 . 71 0 . 0175 * 6 . 85±6 . 20 0 . 0014 * 12 . 59±5 . 83 0 . 0050 * > 2 cm 37 282 . 08±45 . 89 13 . 09±9 . 87 22 . 27±7 . 30 Menopausal status Premenopausal 76 293 . 24±43 . 10 0 . 9622 9 . 19±8 . 80 0 . 2217 14 . 24±6 . 43 0 . 9009 Postmenopausal 17 293 . 80±42 . 09 11 . 85±9 . 62 14 . 89±6 . 91 Lymph node status Negative 65 302 . 43±42 . 41 0 . 0024 * 7 . 25±6 . 92 0 . 0014 * 13 . 11±5 . 64 0 . 0153 * Positive 28 274 . 19±37 . 08 14 . 63±9 . 64 17 . 16±7 . 33 Histologic grade I – II 79 293 . 90±44 . 24 0 . 3802 9 . 20±8 . 58 0 . 6547 14 . 60±6 . 39 0 . 3282 III 14 286 . 81±33 . 29 10 . 19±7 . 22 12 . 22±6 . 86 ER Negative 25 298 . 92±45 . 98 0 . 4646 10 . 93±8 . 68 0 . 7791 15 . 34±6 . 86 0 . 4928 Positive 68 291 . 09±41 . 45 9 . 16±9 . 02 13 . 89±6 . 43 PR Negative 33 299 . 46±44 . 97 0 . 3355 10 . 12±8 . 74 0 . 8733 14 . 21±6 . 49 0 . 7523 Positive 60 289 . 96±41 . 37 9 . 37±9 . 08 14 . 35±6 . 64 Clinical stage 0 – I 52 310 . 98±36 . 78 0 . 0004 * 5 . 55±5 . 44 < 0 . 0001 * 12 . 45±5 . 68 0 . 0037 * II 30 274 . 67±38 . 12 13 . 68±9 . 19 15 . 95±5 . 61 III – IV 11 270 . 78±48 . 08 18 . 27±11 . 21 18 . 83±8 . 56 HER2 − + + 70 290 . 64±44 . 53 0 . 2135 9 . 07±8 . 64 0 . 5257 14 . 06±6 . 48 0 . 6990 + + + 23 302 . 74±36 . 62 10 . 38±7 . 23 14 . 62±6 . 72 Ki67 expression ≤ 14 % 23 304 . 10±39 . 71 0 . 2338 10 . 07±7 . 68 0 . 3948 16 . 29±5 . 84 0 . 3422 > 14 % 70 289 . 69±43 . 59 13 . 60±8 . 13 13 . 94±6 . 53 * p < 0 . 05 , statistically significant 8912 Tumor Biol .

In addition , serum CEA and CA15 - 3 levels were significantly correlated with pa - tient clinical stage and lymph nodal status ( p < 0 . 05 in all cases ) . Correlation and diagnostic values of the three biomarkers To assess the correlation of serum levels of VN , CEA , and CA15 - 3 , Spearman ’ s rank correlation coefficients were used in the analysis of the three biomarkers in normal control and stage 0 – I patients . As shown in Table 3 , there was no signif - icant correlation between VN and CEA in both stage 0 – I pa - tients ( Spearman r = − 0 . 205 , p = 0 . 17168 ) and the normal con - trol group ( Spearman r = − 0 . 104 , p = 0 . 58263 ) . Similarly , VN had no significant correlation with CA15 - 3 in both stage 0 – I patients ( Spearman r = 0 . 159 , p = 0 . 29162 ) and the normal control group ( Spearman r = 0 . 219 , p = 0 . 24416 ) . In order to quantify the diagnostic values of the three bio - markers for distinguishing stage 0 – I patients and normal con - trol , ROC curve analysis was performed on the biomarkers individually ( Fig . 2 ) and in combinations ( Fig . 3 ) . As shown in Fig . 2a – c , all three biomarkers had AUC significantly higher than 0 . 5 ; the AUC value for VN ( 0 . 73 ) was higher than the AUC for CEA ( 0 . 64 ) and CA15 - 3 ( 0 . 69 ) . VN has the highest value with 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) [ 0 . 62 , 0 . 84 ] ( Table 4 ) . Likewise , the superiority of VN over the other two markers was evident with higher sensitivities when spec - ificity was fixed at 90 and 80 % , respectively ( Table 4 ) . As shown in Fig . 3a – d and Table 4 , combining biomarkers result - ed in increased AUC value as compared to individual bio - markers . Combining CEA and CA15 - 3 yielded a ROC curve with the same AUC value as VN alone ( 0 . 73 ) . Combining VN and CEAyielded a ROC curve with higher AUC value ( 0 . 81 ) than the combination of VN and CA15 - 3 ( 0 . 78 ) . More impor - tantly , combining VN , CEA , and CA15 - 3 resulted in an im - provement in ROC curve with the highest AUC value ( 0 . 83 ) among all individual biomarkers and combinations . At a fixed specificity of 90 % , the sensitivity of the three biomarker combination reached 63 % ( 95 % confidence interval , CI 0 . 47 – 0 . 76 ) . Taken together , these data indicates that VN could be used as a breast cancer biomarker capable of distinguishing stage 0 – I breast cancer patients from normal control with higher sensitivity and specificity than existing breast cancer bio - markers CEA and CA15 - 3 . More importantly , combining VN , CEA , and CA15 - 3 increased the diagnostic value with superior sensitivity and specificity for early stage breast can - cer diagnosis . Discussion Previous studies indicated that VN may be a promising bio - marker for breast cancer diagnosis [ 22 – 24 ] . In the present study , we examined serum level of VN in patients with breast cancer in comparison with normal individuals and patients with pre - malignant cancer or cancer at later stages . Our study is the first to thoroughly investigate and compare the serum VN levels at various breast cancer stages and with various non - cancer groups . Our results demonstrated that VN may serve as an early stage breast cancer diagnostic biomarker by Table 3 Spearman ’ s rank correlation coefficients of three biomarkers for distinguishing normal controls and stage 0 – I patients Normal controls Stage 0 – I patients CEA CA15 - 3 VN CEA CA15 - 3 VN CEA 1 1 CA15 - 3 0 . 296 1 0 . 163 1 VN − 0 . 104 0 . 219 1 − 0 . 205 0 . 159 1 p > 0 . 05 in all cases Fig . 2 ROC curves for serum levels of individual biomarkers analyzed ( VN , CEA , and CA15 - 3 ) fordistinguishingstage 0 – I patients and normal controls .

Another key finding of this study is that combination of VN with two existing breast cancer markers CEA and CA15 - 3 could improve sensitivity and specificity of early stage breast cancer diagnosis . In this study , we observed and firstly reported statistically significant negative correlation between VN level and tumor size , lymph node metastatic status , and clinical stage . Howev - er , there was no correlation between VN level and patient menstrual status , histological grade , ER expression , PR ex - pression , HER2 overexpression , and Ki67 expression . More - over , our results showed that serum CEA and CA15 - 3 levels increased with clinical stage and correlated with breast cancer progression , which is similar to observations in other studies [ 25 , 26 ] .

( 2016 ) 37 : 8909 – 8916 Immunohistochemical analysis of breast carcinomas showed particularly prominent accumulation of VN in ECM structures [ 14 ] . VN was reported to be present as extracellular deposits in close proximity to vessels and constituents of a major component of the vascularized breast cancer microen - vironment [ 14 ] . The urokinase - type plasminogen activator ( uPA ) and its cellular receptor ( uPAR ) has been reported to participate in multiple physiological and pathologic processes including cell migration , angiogenesis , inflammation , em - bryogenesis , tumor growth , and metastasis [ 27 – 29 ] . VN was found to play important roles in the tumor cell adhesion , mi - gration , invasion , and growth of solid tumors via interaction with uPAR [ 30 – 33 ] . Angiogenesis is a key step in tumor for - mation . VN was reported to regulate angiogenesis through VEGF [ 11 ] and found to regulate tumor cell invasion and migration through ECM surrounding the tumor epithelium [ 15 , 17 ] . Furthermore , the high level of VN in the serum could promote circulating tumor cells to disseminate and adhere to the distal organ [ 12 ] . Therefore , VN participates in tumor angiogenesis , invasion , migration , and adhesion , which are major steps of cancer metastasis [ 11 , 12 , 16 , 17 ] . Previous study showed serum VN level ( including 65 - and 75 - kDa polypeptides ) was found to be higher in breast cancer patients of all stages as compared to normal control [ 22 ] . While the highest serum VN level in stage 0 – I patients was found compared to the breast cancer in higher stage in our study , that might be the natural form of VN ( 75 kDa ) which was detected in the present study . Moreover , matrix metallo - proteinase ( MMP ) - 2 secreted by tumor cells has been reported to degrade VN [ 34 ] . With the tumor progression , more pro - teinases such as MMP2 were secreted by tumor cells , leading to natural form of VN ( 75 kDa ) degradation in ECM . That might be a good explanation for the lower VN expression in breast cancer serum of higher stages than that of stage 0 – I . Currently , very few serum biomarkers were clinically used for breast cancer diagnosis . CEA and CA15 - 3 are among the few serum markers presently used for monitoring advanced breast cancer progression and treatment response in clinic . The most important characteristic of a tumor marker is to detect the disease in early stages . However , the levels of CEA and CA15 - 3 are mostly elevated in stage III – IV breast cancer patients , and they have low sensitivity and specificity when used to distinguish stage 0 – I and non - cancer subjects ; thus , they are not recommended to be used as biomarkers for diagnosis of breast cancer [ 9 ] . Therefore , there is a strong need for developing new serum biomarkers with higher diagnostic performance than currently used biomarkers for early stage breast cancer diagnosis . Our ROC curve analysis clearly showed that VN displayed higher diagnostic sensitivity and specificity than CA15 - 3 and CEA in distinguishing stage 0 – I breast cancer patients from normal control subjects . Diagnos - tic accuracy may be improved considerably by combining multiple biomarkers [ 35 ] . Therefore , there is a need for combining VN with other clinically used markers to increase the diagnostic performance . Notably , we are the first to iden - tify that combining VN , CEA , and CA15 - 3 resulted in an improvement in ROC curve AUC values and test sensitivity and specificity as compared to individual biomarker or com - binations of two of the three biomarkers . The AUC value of VN , CEA , and CA15 - 3 combination ( 0 . 83 ) is higher than the other groups , suggesting that the VN , CEA , and CA15 - 3 panel has good diagnostic performance . In the present study , we evaluated 162 samples in total ; however , the number of sam - ples with precancerous lesions was only 9 . Thus , the proposed results will require replication in large cohorts , particularly with more precancerous lesions , for the findings could be implemented in clinical laboratories for individual patients . In conclusion , we demonstrated that VN is a promising biomarker alone or in combination with CEA and CA15 - 3 for diagnosis of early stage breast cancer . To our knowledge , this is the first study to use combination measurement of se - rum levels of VN , CEA , and CA15 - 3 in the screening and diagnosis of early stage breast cancer . Further studies are needed to reveal the mechanisms responsible for altered VN expression levels in breast cancer patients .
