Study design : This is a longitudinal study using mobility data from 19 million mobile devices of visits to all types of health facility locations for all U . S . states . Methods : We examine the variations in weekly in - person medical visits across county , neighborhood and specialty levels . Different regression models are employed for each level to investigate factors that influence the disparities in medical visits . County - level analysis explores associations between county medical visit patterns , political orientation and COVID - 19 infection rate . Neighborhood - level analysis focuses on neighborhood socioeconomic compositions as potential determinants of medical visit levels . Specialty - level analysis compares the evolution of visit disruptions in different specialties . Results : A more left - leaning political orientation and a higher local infection rate were associated with larger decreases in in - person medical visits , and these associations became stronger moving from the initial period of stay - at - home orders into the post - lockdown period . Initial reactions were strongest for seniors and those of high socioeconomic status , but this reversed in post - lockdown period where socio - economically disadvantaged communities stabilized at a lower level of medical visits . Neighborhoods with more female and young people exhibited larger decreases in in - person medical visits throughout the initial and post - lockdown periods . The evolution of disruptions diverges across medical specialties , from only short - term disruption in specialties such as dentistry to increasing disruption , as in cardiology . Conclusions : Given distinct patterns in visit between communities , medical service categories and between different periods in the pandemic , policy makers and providers should concentrate on monitoring patients in disrupted specialties who overlap with the at - risk contexts and socioeconomic factors in future health emergencies . Key words : in - person medical visit , health disparities , COVID - 19 , political ideology , medical specialty comparison , mobility data J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 2 1 Introduction How individual and contextual factors shape people’s health behaviors is a fundamental topic in public health research . The COVID - 19 pandemic has created new challenges in this field , especially because seeing a doctor itself presents a considerable exposure risk and may result in infection . Consequently , when making decisions to arrange or forgo an in - person medical visit during an infectious disease pandemic , people need to balance the benefit of the treatment against both the medical cost and the exposure risk , and their judgements are affected by multidimensional factors from individual characteristics to the social environment around them . As delayed or missed care extends diagnosis times , leads to late treatment and increases mortality rates ( 1 - 3 ) , researchers are concerned about long - term negative health consequences and aggravated health inequalities ( 4 ) . Examining factors that discourage people’s health - seeking behaviors and understanding the disparities in health care utilization during the pandemic can highlight flaws in the health care delivery system and inform interventions to mitigate health repercussions in future health crises . Recent empirical studies have noted differences in health care utilization in select communities or specialties ( 5 - 12 ) . However , these issues are still under - studied ( 13 ) , especially when compared with the much more extensive literature on COVID - 19 infection and mortality . One obstacle lies in the difficulty of tracking in - person visits nationally . Private medical sector data , used by most existing studies , is usually restricted to a single health system , a subset of facility types , or a regional level . Public sector data , such as government insurance program , is more geographically comprehensive , but focuses on a subset of the population . This study instead provides a nationally comprehensive answer in the U . S . with mobility data from 19 million mobile devices of visits to all types of health facility locations for all states between January 2019 and November 2020 . The large - scale mobility data enables us to examine how community characteristics affect residents’ health - seeking behaviors , and how disparities in health care utilization evolve in a public health crisis . We consider the multifaceted visit disruptions caused by COVID - 19 in several regards . First , we examine the effect of regional political orientation and COVID - 19 infection rate on residents’ medical visit patterns during the pandemic . Higher local infection rate increases the J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 3 exposure risk , which can directly prevent residents from seeking in - person health care . The perception of risk also varies among political orientation , as rhetoric from conservative sources generally has less emphasis on the threats of the coronavirus than liberal sources ( 14 ) . Second , the pandemic and its economic disruptions impacted socioeconomic groups differently . For example , the elderly , minority racial groups , and low - income individuals have faced higher levels of health or financial risk during the pandemic ( 5 , 15 - 18 ) . Neighborhoods with different socioeconomic compositions could therefore present different medical visit patterns . Third , as patients reduce medical care differently by acuteness of the medical condition and providers have varying abilities to adjust their practices , visit declines in different specialties were not the same . Fourth , we argue that the disparities discussed above in the initial visit responses may differ from later responses in the post - lockdown period . Legal restrictions on providers and patient movement were gradually removed and infection rates and public understanding of the novel coronavirus continued to evolve , making it crucial to examine the issues above over evolving periods . Our study makes several contributions to the literature . First , our results are based on the essentially universal data that covers all U . S . states and a wide range of healthcare locations and specialties . Second , we document the disparities in medical visits by both socio - economic status and medical specialty and further investigate the evolution of the disparities during the pandemic . In addition , we provide possible explanations for the observed behaviors based on relevant literature on health and social science . 2 Methods 2 . 1 Data Our primary data source for in - person medical visits comes from SafeGraph , which provides accurate and comprehensive foot traffic data of individuals to business establishments in the U . S . SafeGraph tracks 19 million mobile devices nationwide and provides information on their weekly visits to business establishments by U . S . Census Block Group ( CBG ) . A CBG is the smallest geographical unit used by the Census Bureau in sample data and typically has a J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 4 population of 600 to 3 , 000 individuals . This data covers the entire year of 2019 and the first 47 weeks of 2020 . We preprocessed the mobility data to obtain the estimates of weekly in - person medical visits from each CBG . We first used the North American Industry Classification System ( NAICS ) codes in the SafeGraph data to identify health facilities among all business establishments . We then validated the list of health facilities and obtained specialty information by matching individual facilities with the Health & Medical category of Yelp , a webservice which publishes crowd - sourced reviews of businesses . Health and Medical businesses on Yelp were divided into 33 specialties based on the medical specialty guides by the Association of American Medical Colleges and American Medical Association . We also performed a normalization to handle the sampling bias and panel change in the mobility dataset . Our final dataset covers 215 , 714 CBGs and 508 , 380 health facilities in all 50 U . S . states and the District of Columbia . This data records the estimated total weekly visits to all these health facilities from each CBG . Additional details in data collection and preprocessing can be found in the supplementary material . 2 . 2 Measures Our outcome measure is total weekly visits to health facilities on county , neighborhood ( CBG ) and specialty levels adjusted for both within - year seasonality and across - year initial demand conditions . To control for seasonality , we normalize each 2020 week’s visits by a 5 - week moving average from that week in 2019 . To control for baseline 2020 visits , which could differ from 2019 due to changes in population or health facility - specific changes , we further adjust the outcome measure by the ratio of the pre - pandemic 2020 baseline ( weeks 1 - 11 ) with the same weeks in 2019 . For example , suppose residents in a neighborhood had 75 visits in week 20 of 2020 , and on average the 5 control weeks in 2019 had 100 visits . If the average visits from this neighborhood increased from 80 during weeks 1 - 11 in the 2019 baseline to 90 in weeks 1 - 11 in the 2020 baseline , our final outcome measure for medical visits from this hypothetical neighborhood in week 20 would be ( 75 / 100 ) / ( 90 / 80 ) = 0 . 67 , suggesting a decline of 33 percent in visits . This seasonality framework has been used previously in adjusting J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 5 hospital admission data ( 5 ) . Our incorporation of data in 2019 and the addition of seasonality controls answer the call for expanded analysis from prior healthcare visit studies ( 19 ) . In the county - level analysis , we determined a county’s political orientation by its popular votes in the U . S . presidential election in 2020 and measured exposure risk by weekly new COVID - 19 cases per 100 , 000 residents . A county is defined as Left - leaning if the Democrats received more popular votes than the Republicans in this county . The election data was downloaded from MIT Election Data and Science Lab ( 20 ) . The weekly new COVID - 19 cases per 100 , 000 residents were calculated from the COVID - 19 data published by New York Times ( 21 ) . In the neighborhood - level analysis , the neighborhood socioeconomic compositions are measured by ten variables in four categories : age and gender , race and ethnicity , education , and economic status . For example , age and gender category include the percentage of residents aged 65 and over , the percentage under age 18 and the percentage of female . All these variables were derived from the American Community Survey ( 2016 ) . More details are provided in the supplementary materials . 2 . 3 Statistical analysis We perform our analyses in three steps , focusing on in - person medical visits differences by counties , neighborhoods , and specialties respectively . In general , we use fixed - effects regression models with indicator variables for whether a week is in the initial or post - lockdown period , compared to the pre - pandemic period . We then interact the period indicators with the characteristics of interest to measure changes in in - person medical visits attributable to that characteristic compared to pre - pandemic levels . The initial lockdown period ( weeks 12 - 20 of 2020 ) begins the week of March 16 , when U . S . states began to announce shelter - in - place orders and mandatory stay - at - home orders ( 22 ) ; the post - lockdown period ( week 21 - 47 of 2020 ) begins the week of May 18 when all states had begun easing restrictions and initiating reopening processes ( 23 ) . A potential concern for this period specification is that it may omit variation across areas due to policy differences . To address this concern , we also perform our analysis using a more refined county - specific period definition according to dates of the implementation and reversal of policy interventions for each J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 6 county collected by Johns Hopkins University ( 24 ) . This refined period specification , as a robustness check , yields results that are consistent with our main findings and are reported in the supplementary materials . In the county - level analysis , the period indicators are interacted with both the political orientation ( Left - leaning or not ) and the log weekly new cases per 100 , 000 residents to predict the county - weekly level medical visits . We add the interaction of period indicators with county socioeconomic characteristics as covariates . County and week fixed effects are included , and standard errors are clustered at the county level . Our neighborhood - level models include neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics as individual variables interacted with the period indicators . Socioeconomic characteristics , such as education and income , may be influenced by other fixed demographic characteristics such as gender , age , and race ( 25 ) . To address this , we take a two - part approach in this set of analyses : we first individually estimate the association of medical visits with fixed characteristics , including age , gender , race , and ethnicity , and then successively introduce remaining socioeconomic factors to estimate the remaining associations while controlling for these fixed characteristics and related factors . The period - level interactions with each county are included in all these models to sweep out the county - level variation . Neighborhood and week fixed effects are included , and all standard errors are clustered at the neighborhood level . Finally , we perform the specialty - level analysis by running a regression for each specialty grouping using all weekly visits to these facilities only with period indicators . After obtaining the estimated reduction in each specialty during the two pandemic periods compared to the pre - pandemic levels , we divide the specialties into four quadrants based on their joint decreases in both periods , labelled as long - term disruption , increasing disruption , short - term disruption , and least disruption , respectively . Detailed discussion of our statistical analysis , including specifications of regression equations , can be found in the supplementary materials . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 7 3 Results 3 . 1 Differences by political orientation and infection rate The county - level analyses provide strong evidence that residents were more likely to reduce in - person medical visits in areas with more left - leaning political orientation and higher local infection rate . Column ( 1 ) in Table 1 reports our main results on the total national sample . Left - leaning counties showed a higher decrease in visits by 1 . 5 percentage points in the initial COVID - 19 pandemic period , increasing to 5 . 2 percentage points in the subsequent post - lockdown period . Given the baseline decreases of 35 percentage points and 28 percentage points ( compared to pre - pandemic levels ) in the two periods respectively , these estimates severally correspond to a 4 . 3 % increase and a 18 . 6 % increase in the magnitude of visit disruptions . For the local infection rate , doubling weekly cases of new infections per 100 , 000 people was associated with a greater decrease in medical visits by ln ( 2 ) × 0 . 3 = 0 . 2 percentage point in the initial period , increasing to ln ( 2 ) × 0 . 9 = 0 . 6 percentage point in the post - lockdown period . We check the robustness of the above findings in column ( 2 ) - ( 6 ) . We remove the interaction terms between period indicators and county socioeconomic characteristics in column ( 2 ) , and keep the associations between medical visits , political orientation and infection rate . Column ( 3 ) - ( 6 ) present results separately for the four regions of the U . S . , the Northeast , South , West and Midwest . Interestingly , in the initial period , only a few regions saw significant differences in medical visit disruptions by political orientation and local infection rate . However , when the strict lockdown restrictions were relaxed , these differences became significant and more substantial in nearly all four regions . There were wider discrepancies in individuals’ health - seeking behaviors by political orientation and infection rate from the initial lockdown period to the post - lockdown period .

Standard errors are clustered at county levels . * * * significant at 1 % , * * significant at 5 % . 3 . 2 Differences by socioeconomic status Ahead of our formal analysis , we present a model - free graphical comparison of the patterns of average in - person medical visits of two different types of neighborhoods in Figure 1 . Both categories’ average visits exhibited a sharp decline entering the pandemic period . The initial period’s drop in visits was steeper in those neighborhoods designated as low minority and low economic burden . However , this trend reversed moving into post - lockdown period , where high minority or high economic burden neighborhoods lagged as overall visits began to rebound in non - minority and lower burden neighborhoods . High minority and economic burden neighborhoods remained below other neighborhoods for the duration of the post - lockdown period . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 9 Figure 1 : Patterns of average in - person medical visits of two types of neighborhoods differentiated by race / ethnicity composition and economic status . Notes : A neighborhood is designated as high minority or economic burden if at least 50 percent of residents are Black or Hispanic / Latino or at least 50 percent of residents are in low - income households or unemployed . A neighborhood is designated as low minority and economic burden if less than 10 % of residents have these same characteristics . The weekly in - person visit ratios have been adjusted for within - year seasonality and across - year initial demand conditions using 2019 data and center around 1 ( i . e . , a value of 0 . 67 indicates a 33 percent decline in visits compared to pre - pandemic levels ) . Table 2 summarizes the relationships of neighborhood socioeconomic compositions with in - person medical visit patterns estimated by formal regression models . Column ( 3 ) - ( 4 ) present the original estimates of coefficients of interest , summarized from seven regressions in our two - part approach . To enable interpretation of these coefficients , we present the marginal effect of a one standard deviation ( s . d . ) increase in a neighborhood’s percentage of that socioeconomic characteristic in column ( 1 ) - ( 2 ) in Table 2 . For example , the results show that one s . d . higher percentage of Black ( compared to White ) in a neighborhood was on average associated with a slower decline in medical visits by 2 . 1 percentage points in the initial period , which implies a 6 % difference relative to the baseline decrease of 35 percentage points .

The dependent variable is the 2020 neighborhood - weekly level in - person medical visit ratio centered around 1 . ( i . e . , a value of 0 . 67 indicates a 33 percent decline in visits compared to pre - pandemic levels ) . The ratios have been adjusted for within - year seasonality and across - year initial demand conditions using 2019 data . Original coefficients are summarized from seven regressions in a two - part approach : associations for fixed characteristics , including race , ethnicity , age , and gender , are individually estimated , then associations for remaining characteristics are estimated with controls for the fixed characteristics and related factors . County - period , neighborhood , and week fixed effects are included in each regression . Detailed results are included in the supplementary material . Estimates of marginal effects are calculated by multiplying the original coefficients by the standard J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 11 deviation of the respective socioeconomic composition variable . Standard errors are clustered at neighborhood levels . * * * significant at 1 % , * * significant at 5 % , * significant at 10 % . Race and ethnicity . Although high Black resident neighborhoods were slower to stop in - person visits during the initial period , this reversed later : a one s . d . higher percentage of Black was associated with a higher decrease in visits by 2 . 4 percentage points in post - lockdown period . Hispanic / Latino ethnicity was the largest indicator of decreasing medical visits in post - lockdown period , with a one s . d . increase in Hispanic / Latino being associated with a lower visit level by 3 . 9 percentage points compared to non - Hispanic . Notably , this also only occurred in post - lockdown period . In the initial period , contrarily , high Hispanic / Latino resident neighborhoods exhibited higher visit levels . No significant differences were observed between neighborhoods with high percentage of Asian versus White in both two periods . Age and gender . Compared with the working age baseline group , those over 65 decreased more in - person medical visits in the initial period but also returned more quickly later . High rates of younger residents decreased more in - person medical visit levels by 1 . 5 percentage points during the initial period , growing to 1 . 7 percentage points later . Females also decreased in - person visits more than males in both periods . Education . The association between visits and education was not uniform over the two pandemic periods . During the initial period , high rates of low education were associated with relatively higher visit levels . In post - lockdown period , low education neighborhoods were instead associated with 2 . 4 percentage points lower visit levels compared to areas with higher average levels of college education ( for a one s . d . difference ) . Economic status . In the initial period , a one s . d . increase in the rate of low - income increased in - person visits by 1 . 1 percentage points compared to the middle - income category , whereas neighborhoods with high rate of high - income were 1 . 7 percentage points lower . During post - lockdown period , this reversed and high - income households were 2 . 0 percentage points more likely to resume in - person visits , whereas low - income households were 0 . 7 percentage point lower . Significant differences by unemployment status did not emerge until post - lockdown period , where high unemployment neighborhoods were associated with lower visit levels . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 12 3 . 3 Differences by specialty classification Figure 2 maps specialty types into four quadrants by level of visit decreases during the initial versus post - lockdown period . All specialty types saw a decrease in visits of at least 30 percent during the initial period , but further decreases varied widely in the post - lockdown period . Figure 2 : Comparison of in - person medical visits patterns by specialty and pandemic period . Notes : The vertical and horizontal axes show percentage point decreases in visits for the initial and post - lockdown periods compared to pre - pandemic levels , respectively . The dotted lines indicate the modal decrease in visits for both periods ( a 38 percent decrease ) . Results are based on weekly observations for 33 specialties in weeks 12 - 47 of 2020 . The weekly values have been adjusted for within - year seasonality and across - year initial demand conditions using 2019 data . The top right quadrant contains specialties with large initial drops which continued into post - lockdown period , labeled “long - term disruption . ” Specialties furthest out in this quadrant include Eye specialists , Optometrists , and Counseling and mental health . The lower right quadrant classifies specialties of “increasing disruption , ” with below - average disruption initially but above - average decreases later . This includes General obstetrics and gynecology , Surgery , Urology , Cardiologists , and Family medicine . The top left quadrant represents “short - term disruption”—large initial visit decreases followed by a return to in - person visits . This includes General dentists , Dental specialists , J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 13 Pediatric dentists , and Dermatology . This quadrant also includes two specialties with increases in visits compared to pre - pandemic levels during post - lockdown period , Urgent care and Sleep medicine . The final quadrant on the lower left represents “least disruption” specialties , jointly showing only small decreases . These include Emergency medicine , Internal medicine specialists , Pain medicine , and Senior care . 4 Discussion To prevent long - term negative health consequences , health care providers and policy makers need to understand the composition and evolution of health care disruptions in an infectious disease pandemic . The outbreak of COVID - 19 pandemic provides a suitable context for identifying insights that are key for intervention campaigns and to prepare for future public health emergencies . This study uses large - scale , nationally comprehensive U . S . mobility data to examine the disparities in health care visits from the initial pandemic period into the subsequent post - lockdown period on county , neighborhood and specialty levels . The negative associations between the left - leaning political orientation , infection rate and in - person visit levels suggest a concern : although left - oriented individuals might protect themselves better from the risk of infection ( 26 - 28 ) , their larger decreases in medical visits reflected more forgone care and unsatisfied needs , which could increase a wide range of other health risks in infectious disease pandemics . The rapid expansion of telehealth during the pandemic ( 29 ) can mitigate some of the concerns . However , increases in telemedicine use were not enough to offset in - person visits drops ( 30 ) , and not all in - person care can be delivered online ( 29 , 31 ) . Another noteworthy finding is that political orientation became a more significant factor in shaping health - seeking behaviors in the post - lockdown period , which may reflect both the increased partisan opinion divides on the pandemic ( 32 ) and a decreased sense of fear and anxiety of COVID - 19 ( 33 ) in the US : when people are less afraid , their responses to the pandemic are more influenced by their political ideology ( 27 , 34 ) . The rate’s relevance indicates that maintaining a lower infection rate contributes to the overall health by less hindering people’s health - seeking behaviors . In the post - lockdown period , local governors dynamically adjusted the control measures according to the infection rate , which further increased the rate’s relevance . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 14 The minorities , low - educated and low - income population responded less at first compared to other socioeconomic groups but decreased their medical visits more substantially moving into the post - lockdown period . These at - risk groups might be slower to recognize the danger of the coronavirus and had limited availability and ability to switch to alternatives to in - person visits in the initial pandemic period . For instance , previous research has indicated that these groups may face technological barriers to using telehealth , including limited internet connectivity , reduced smartphone access and inadequate technological literacy ( 29 ) . The reversal in the post - lockdown period could have resulted from the increased economic distress for the at - risk groups , as they suffered from more serious and persistent job losses than their counterparts ( 16 ) , and needed longer time to recover income losses caused by the pandemic ( 18 ) . Hispanics were associated with the largest decreases in in - person visits post - lockdowns . This population is more likely to live in multigenerational family households , increasing transmission rates , and work in industries that witnessed dramatic job losses during 2020 ( 15 ) . In addition , traveling cost and car availability were major transportation barriers to health care during the pandemic ( 35 ) . The continued economic distress after lockdown could prevent the at - risk groups from seeking health care and harm their long - term health . Two other neighborhood socioeconomic composition variables were associated with fewer medical visits throughout the pandemic , including the percentage of female and the percentage under age 18 . Risk perception research has found that women are more likely to perceive higher levels of health risks than men ( 36 , 37 ) , which might impel women to reduce more in - person visits in the pandemic . Concern for children’s health could make families with kids reduce their in - person visits , despite children’s lower risk of the coronavirus ( 38 ) . We attribute the elderly’s stronger rebounds in medical visits in the post - lockdown period to their more severe non - COVID illnesses . Another factor in the return of those over 65 to in - person visits may be dislike of telemedicine use or lack of access to these services ( 12 ) . At the provider level , Emergency medicine was among the least disrupted , but still faced a nontrivial decrease in visits , suggesting there were “missing” patients who delayed critical care . However , Urgent care visits decreased substantially less than nearly every other specialty , so it is plausible that some low - acuity Emergency Department visits were diverted into a non - ED environment ( 39 ) . Senior care was also among the least disrupted , including care such as hospice J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 15 and personal care services whose urgent needs have few telehealth substitutes . Dental specialties saw only short - term disruption , with one of the largest rebounds in post - lockdown period . This may be attributable to most care necessitating in - person visits and previous experience equipping providers for highly transmissible diseases , such as HIV . Specialties with increasing disruption and long - term disruption were more likely to be associated with higher health risk . For example , obstetric care is believed to be particularly compromised in disruptions ; females face more challenges in seeking reproductive healthcare and have a decreased desire for pregnancy ( 40 ) . The increasing disruption in General obstetrics and gynecology visits in our mobility data reflects this issue nationally . Persistent decreases in Cardiology visits also raise concerns since early studies reported increased mortality in heart - related conditions following visit decreases during lockdown periods ( 1 ) . Our study has several limitations . First , political orientation and socioeconomic characteristics are measured at the county level or neighborhood level instead of individual level . Second , the mobility data only measures in - person visits . However , in - person visits have different efficacy than telemedicine , so these results still contribute to forecasting health concerns . Third , because SafeGraph data records visits to a geographic location , “stacked” offices , that is facilities on different levels of the same structure , may be counted as one location in the mobility data , which generates bias for medical visit estimations . Fourth , this study does not strictly investigate the causalities and mechanisms for the focused disparities . Instead , our results reflect disparity outcomes using large - scale actual behavioral data and reveal significant disruptions to in - person medical visits in different periods in an infectious disease pandemic .
