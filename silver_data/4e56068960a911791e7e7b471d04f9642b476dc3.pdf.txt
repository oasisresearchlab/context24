Its ability to switch from planktonic life to aggregates , forming the so - called biofilms , is a front - line mechanism of antimicrobial resistance . The bacterial carbohydrate - binding protein LecB is an integral component and necessary for biofilm formation . Here , we report a new class of drug - like low molecular weight inhibitors of the lectin LecB with nanomolar affinities and excellent receptor binding kinetics and thermodynamics . This class of glycomimetic inhibitors efficiently blocked biofilm formation of P . aeruginosa in vitro while the natural monovalent carbohydrate ligands failed . Furthermore , excellent selectivity and pharmacokinetic properties were achieved . Notably , two compounds showed good oral bioavailability and high compound concentrations in plasma and urine were achieved in vivo .

The two quorum sensing regulated 13 virulence factors LecA 14 and LecB 15 ( formerly called PA - IL and PA - IIL ) are crucial for biofilm formation by P . aeruginosa . These two carbohydrate - binding proteins , i . e . lectins , were initially isolated from the clinical isolate PAO1 by Gilboa - Garber et al . . 16 Problematic for therapy , P . aeruginosa shows a high genomic diversity among different isolates . 17 , 18 While LecA is relatively conserved among strains , LecB varies and clinical isolates can be grouped into either PAO1 - or PA14 - like LecB sequence families , and both types cover approximately 50 % each of the clinical isolates . 19 , 20 However , we could show that despite numerous sequence variations in the two LecB variants , they possess comparable binding specificity which is a prerequisite for targeting a broad range of clinical isolates with one single drug . 20 The exact mechanism of the lectins’ role in biofilm formation is not fully understood . It is assumed , that these tetravalent lectins act as bridging agents to enable glycan - mediated bacterial adhesion to Page 3 of 25 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Journal of the American Chemical Society 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960 4 the cellular glycocalix of the host’s tissue . In addition , they are believed to mediate contact between bacterial cells through cell - surface glycoconjugates and , further , with the bacterially produced multivalent exopolysaccharides for the establishment of bacterial aggregates and biofilms . 11 This biofilm reinforcing property of the lectins , which results from its multivalency , can be blocked by inhibition of the carbohydrate binding sites . In a mouse infection model , LecB was shown to be the major determinant for bacterial lung colonization . 21 , 22 Furthermore , this protein influences signaling pathways in human lung epithelial cells leading to β - catenin degradation , a host protein that is crucially involved in tissue repair . 23 On a structural level , LecB forms non - covalent homotetramers and each monomer contains two Ca 2 + - ions , 20 , 24 which mediate the binding to its carbohydrate ligands , L - fucose and D - mannose . It has been shown in humans and mice , that inhalation of millimolar concentrations of these natural sugars contributed to clearance of bacteria from the lungs and , furthermore , showed synergistic activities with co - administered antibiotics . 25 , 26 Due to higher affinities towards fucosides over mannosides , research focussed on fucose - based inhibitors with multivalent presentation to further increase avidity . 27 , 28 This approach yielded multivalent glycopeptide dendrimer structures with the ability to efficiently inhibit the formation of and disperse established biofilms of P . aeruginosa . 29 Interestingly , in another case of multivalent fucosides , despite nanomolar affinities for LecB , millimolar concentrations ( 5 mM ) have been reported necessary for efficient inhibition of biofilm formation and compounds were inactive at 100 µM . 21 In the same study , these multivalent inhibitors were even shown to promote bacterial aggregation . Thus , it is conceivable that some multivalent lectin inhibitors can act as mimics of the bacterial exopolysaccharides and , therefore , unintentionally contribute to biofilm integrity rather than to its desired disintegration . In order to circumvent such a detrimental biofilm - stabilizing effect of multivalent ligands through cross - linking of the tetravalent lectins inside the biofilm , we have focussed on monovalent low Page 4 of 25 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Journal of the American Chemical Society 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960 5 molecular weight inhibitors of LecB . 30 - 34 In addition , only small molecules can be developed into drug - like molecules with favorable pharmakokinetic properties , i . e . oral application with systemic drug bioavailability , which is necessary to reach all possible types of the various organ and tissue infections elicited by P . aeruginosa . Thus , small monovalent molecules hold the premise to circumvent both biofilm - reinforcing effects and the restriction to topical applications for the multivalent systems . Here , we report two types of monovalent glycomimetic LecB inhibitors , cinnamides 6 and sulfonamides 7 . These new low molecular weight C - glycosidic LecB inhibitors showed nanomolar potency against LecB with excellent target selectivity , toxicity and in vitro ADME properties . Notably , the glycomimetic sulfonamides developed here were potent inhibitors of biofilm formation in stark contrast to the ineffective native carbohydrates . Finally , a murine in vivo pharmacokinetic study revealed the suitability of these glycomimetics for oral application in a proof - of - concept infection model . Results and Discussion Design and synthesis of C - glycoside LecB inhibitors We have previously modified the rather weak LecB ligand methyl α - D - mannoside ( 1 ) into derivatives with various aromatic substituents attached to C - 6 , which increased potency up to a factor of 20 and addressed a new subsite at the target ( e . g . , 2a - c and 3a - c , Figure 1 , Table 1 ) . 30 , 32 In contrast to rapidly dissociating 1 ( t 1 / 2 = 45 sec ) , these compounds showed extended receptor residence times with complex half - lives in the 5 - 20 minute range , revealing the molecular basis for the increased potency . This property is an important requirement for in vivo efficacy . In order to further optimize target interactions and increase stability towards hydrolases , we merged functional Page 5 of 25 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Journal of the American Chemical Society 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960 6 groups establishing attractive interactions with LecB from the natural ligands into one molecule ( 1 → 5 , Figure 1 ) . 31 The equatorial methyl group in 5 resulted in C - glycosides with four - to sixfold enhanced affinities originating from the reported lipophilic contact of the L - fucose methyl group with the lectin . 20 , 24 , 35 Despite these numerous improvements , the previously reported molecules display only moderate affinities for LecB in the range of 3 . 3 - 16 µM , which is insufficient for an application . Now , we aimed to combine the individually optimized structures of mannose - derivatives 2a / 3a and C - glycoside 5 into the monovalent drug - like molecules 6 and 7 to increase affinity towards the target and assess their biological properties . Furthermore , these new glycomimetic structures , 6 and 7 , are expected to be more stable against host metabolism compared to their glycosidic precursors , resulting from the absence of a labile glycosidic linkage . This design should enable higher compound concentrations in vivo . Figure 1 : Rational design of 6 and 7 as monovalent C - glycosidic glycomimetic LecB inhibitors .

Then , the fucose / mannose hybrid - type structures 6 and 7 bearing amide or sulfonamide substituents , respectively , were generated by coupling with different electrophiles . Besides the amide - bridged cinnamic acid moiety as present in 2a and 6a or the sulfonamide - bridged trimethylphenyl moiety in 3a and 7a , a thiophenesulfonamide was introduced in mannoside 3b and C - glycoside 7b as a bioisoster of the potent phenylsulfonamide 3c 30 in the mannose - series . The final coupling step yielded amides 6a , b and sulfonamides 7a , b in moderate to good yields ( 33 - 72 % , over 2 steps ) . Scheme 1 : Synthesis of the structures 6a , b and 7a , b .

Improved binding properties of C - glycoside structures towards LecB Derivatives 6a , b and 7a , b were then analyzed for their capacity to inhibit the two representative lectin variants of the two clinically occurring strain clades , LecB PAO1 and LecB PA14 , based on previously established competitive binding assays 20 , 30 ( Figure 2 ) . Furthermore , all other glycomimetics ( i . e . 2a - c , 3a - c , 5 ) were assayed for the first time also towards LecB PA14 and showed stronger binding to the PA14 variant compared to LecB PAO1 , with the exception of cinnamides 2a , b . In general , enhanced affinities were detected for C - glycoside derivatives 6a , b and 7a , b compared to their respective mannose analogs 2a , b and 3a , b . Cinnamide 6a ( IC 50 [ LecB PAO1 ] 4 . 21 µM ; Page 7 of 25 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Journal of the American Chemical Society 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960 8 IC 50 [ LecB PA14 ] 2 . 49 µM ) showed 9 - to 16 - fold higher affinities towards both LecB types compared to its mannose reference 2a ( IC 50 [ LecB PAO1 ] 37 µM ; 30 IC 50 [ LecB PA14 ] 39 µM ) . The sulfonamide 7a ( IC 50 [ LecB PAO1 ] 0 . 97 µM ; IC 50 [ LecB PA14 ] 0 . 34 µM ) was a 3 - to 5 - fold stronger ligand of LecB compared to the corresponding mannoside 3a , exceeding the potency of the high - affinity natural ligand L - fucose ( 8 ) for both lectin types ( IC 50 [ LecB PAO1 ] 2 . 74 µM ; 30 IC 50 [ LecB PA14 ] 0 . 91 µM 20 ) . Based on the four reference pairs analyzed , i . e . , mannoside vs . C - glycoside : 2a / 6a , 2b / 6b , 3a / 7a and 3b / 7b , which differ only at the anomeric position of mannose , a strong increase in affinity towards LecB of up to 16 - fold was identified for the C - glycosides . In general , the introduction of amide and sulfonamide substituents always improved affinity for LecB compared to the unsubstituted reference hybrid - structure 5 . 31 Importantly , for the first time the two clinically relevant variants 20 of LecB were analyzed with glycomimetic inhibitors , which showed potent inhibition for both strain types . The thermodynamics of binding of derivatives 6a and 7a , b to both LecB variants was then studied by isothermal titration calorimetry ( Figure 3 , Table S1 - 3 ) . All ligands showed K d values in the low micro - to nanomolar range and a 1 : 1 binding stoichiometry , confirming the IC 50 data obtained . Notably , compared to the carbocyclic derivatives 6a and 7a ( Δ H - 37 . 8 to - 31 . 4 kJ / mol ) , the thiophene - containing ligand 7b showed an enhanced enthalpy driven binding ( Δ H - 50 . 0 and - 48 . 1 kJ / mol ) , which was partially compensated by disfavored entropic contributions ( - T Δ S 13 . 4 and 12 . 7 kJ / mol ) . Thus , the introduced substituents also significantly enhanced binding enthalpy compared to the unsubstituted congener 5 ( Δ H - 27 . 5 kJ / mol ) . An increased enthalpic contribution to binding was previously introduced as a benchmark parameter assigned to a higher degree of target selectivity due to a better quality of the drug - target interaction . 36 Furthermore , physicochemical metrics such as ligand efficiency and related ones , thought to gauge the quality of a drug - target interaction , 37 are promising . Importantly , the most potent compound thiophene 7b displayed enthalphy - driven nanomolar affinities towards both LecB variants .

Means and standard deviations were determined from a minimum of three independent titrations . One representative titration graph is depicted for LecB PAO1 only . We have previously detected a strong increase of the receptor half - lives for inhibitors 2a , b and 3a , in comparison to natural carbohydrate ligand methyl α - D - mannoside ( 1 ) . 32 The role of ligand - receptor binding kinetics is becoming increasingly significant for drug discovery and translation of in vitro binding kinetics into cellular or in vivo effects was discussed . 38 For the in vivo efficacy of a drug molecule , prolonged receptor residence times are of importance . Ligand - receptor binding kinetics of the C - glycosides 6a and 7a were studied by surface plasmon resonance ( SPR ) with surface - bound LecB PAO1 ( Figure 4 ) . With its affinity of 330 nM obtained from SPR , the hybrid - type structure 7a is a 140 - fold more potent ligand of LecB than its carbohydrate ligand 1 and is tenfold more potent than the natural high affinity ligand L - fucose ( 8 ) ( see ITC experiments ; K d for 8 2 . 9 µM 39 ) . Most importantly , a further increase of the drug - receptor half lives for the C - glycosides 6a and 7a over their mannose - based analogs 2a ( t 1 / 2 6 . 3 min and K d by SPR 18 . 1 µM ) and 3a ( t 1 / 2 18 . 6 min and K d by SPR 1 . 12 µM ) 32 was observed . Receptor residence times of 28 minutes for 6a and 7a resulted from very slow off rates of 4 . 1x10 - 4 s - 1 of these C - glycosides . Thus , these glycomimetics form a 38 - fold more stable complex with the protein , compared to the natural ligand methyl α - D - mannoside ( 1 , t 1 / 2 0 . 75 min , K d by SPR 47 . 5 µM ) . 32 These data validated the results from the Page 10 of 25 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Journal of the American Chemical Society 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960 11 competitive binding assay and ITC and further stress the impact of the additional equatorial methyl group in our glycomimetics . cmpd K d [ µM ] k on [ M - 1 s - 1 ] k off [ s - 1 ] x10 3 t 1 / 2 [ min ] R max [ RU ] 6a 1 . 62 255 . 2 0 . 41 28 . 0 105 . 2 7a 0 . 33 1263 0 . 41 28 . 2 92 . 8 Figure 4 .

Structure of LecB in complex with hybrid inhibitors To study the binding mode of the hybrid - type LecB inhibitors , we performed crystallization of these ligands in complex with the lectin . Crystals of two ligands 7a and 7b in complex with LecB PA14 were obtained by the hanging drop co - crystallization method and the structures were solved to 1 . 65 Å resolution ( Figure 5 , Table S4 ) . In both complexes , the carbohydrate - binding sites were occupied with the respective inhibitors except one site in the LecB / 7a complex . Surprisingly , a slightly different binding mode for the methyl containing analog 7a was observed in contrast to the previously reported structure 30 of its mannose analog 2a ( Figure 5A , Figures S1 , S3 ) . While the carbohydrate - derived ring is in an identical position , the aromatic moiety attached to the Page 11 of 25 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Journal of the American Chemical Society 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960 12 exocyclic CH 2 is rotated and located in a cleft of the protein surface that is enclosed by two neighboring loops ( S68 - D75 and E95 - D104 ) of the lectin . The methyl group attached to the aromatic ring interacts with hydrophobic patches formed by V69 and a CH 2 - group of D96 ; one sulfonamide oxygen of the ligand establishes a hydrogen bond with the backbone amide of G24 . In contrast for the mannoside 2a , a lipophilic contact between the protein surface ( G24 , V69 ) and the mesitylene - ring was observed together with a hydrogen bond of its sulfonamide nitrogen with the side chain of D96 ( Figure S1 ) . The latter interaction results from a conformational change of the C5 – C6 bond in the carbohydrate from a gt - orientation ( N gauche to O5 and trans to O4 ) , as present in the complex of LecB with D - mannose ( pdb code : for LecB PAO1 1OUR , 40 or LecB PA14 5A6Y 20 ) , to a tg - conformation in the mannoside 2a enabling this observed NH - D96 hydrogen bond . A comparable binding mode as in the C - glycoside 7a was detected for its analog thiophene 7b ( Figure 5B , Figures S1 , S3 ) . In the structure of mannoside 2a / LecB , a crystal lattice - dependent π - stacking of the aromatic moiety with a second ligand from a neighboring LecB tetramer is observed with all ligands in this structure showing the tg - conformation ( Figure S2 ) . Therefore , we consider the binding modes reported here with the gt - orientation displayed by C - glycosides 7a and 7b as the relevant ones , where crystal induced contacts are absent . In addition to the sulfonamide substituent interactions , a lipophilic contact of the introduced C - glycosidic methyl group with the protein residues T45 and A23 is observed in both analyzed complexes of hybrid - type ligands providing a molecular basis for the measured affinity enhancement .

Low molecular weight glycomimetics are potent inhibitors of bacterial biofilm formation We then tested the most promising compounds in a P . aeruginosa biofilm assay . Most published biofilm assays require staining and washing steps which impacted on the reproducibility in our hands . Therefore , we generated genetically modified P . aeruginosa constitutively and intracellulary expressing the red - fluorescent protein mCherry from the pMP7605 plasmid . 41 Because fluorescence intensity directly correlated with cell density ( Figure S4 ) , mCherry - derived fluorescence was exploited as an internal stain for bacterial visualization and quantification of biofilm formation by confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscopy . By eliminating washing and staining steps , this method improved reproducibility through in situ imaging . A set of selected compounds comprising Page 13 of 25 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Journal of the American Chemical Society 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960 14 natural carbohydrates ( mannoside 1 , fucoside 11 ) , glycomimetic mannose - derivatives ( 2a , 3a ) and C - glycosides ( 6a , 7a , 7b ) was selected for assessment of their potential to inhibit biofilm formation by P . aeruginosa . To exclude any unwanted antibiotic effect on biofilm formation , the total fluorescence intensity was recorded after bacterial growth in presence of compounds for 23 h . Bacteria grew to the same density as the DMSO control under each condition tested ( Figure S5 ) . Thus , these results clearly indicated the absence of bactericidal or bacteriostatic effects for the tested compounds .

Remarkably , the natural carbohydrate ligands methyl α - D - mannoside ( 1 ) and methyl α - L - fucoside ( 11 ) , showed only a small Page 14 of 25 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Journal of the American Chemical Society 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960 15 reduction in biofilm mass which was statistically insignificant . In contrast , all glycomimetics tested showed a significant reduction of biofilm formation with the novel sulfonamide C - glycosides 7 as most potent compounds reaching approx . 80 % to 90 % of inhibition . Mannose analogs 2a and 3a also inhibited with a reduced potency the formation of biofilms with 54 % and 66 % observed reduction , respectively . Compound selectivity for LecB over host lectins Carbohydrate - binding proteins are ubiquitous and many play important roles in host innate immune defense . 42 Thus , inhibitors of LecB carrying natural carbohydrate epitopes may also result in unspecific inhibition of human pathogen - recognition receptors . Langerin is a C - type lectin expressed in human Langerhans cells and CD103 + dermal dendritic cells and recognizes predominantly D - mannose , but also L - fucose , N - acetyl - D - glucosamine and sulfated carbohydrates . 43 , 44 As the C - glycosides presented here contain structural elements of D - mannose , L - fucose and sulfonamide moieties , they are potential ligands of Langerin . Therefore , this protein was chosen as one representative host lectin to study compound specificity . In order to assess the compounds’ selectivity , 6a , 7a and its natural ligand L - fucose ( 8 ) were analyzed for Langerin binding in a competitive 19 F R 2 - filtered NMR assay 44 ( Figure 7 ) . The natural ligand 8 was recognized by Langerin with slightly decreased affinity ( K i of 7 . 2 mM ) compared to D - mannose ( K i 4 . 5 mM 44 ) ; C - glycosides 6a and 7a also showed moderate binding to this human protein in the millimolar range . However , both compounds displayed a 1000 - fold stronger affinity for LecB , and are therefore considered selective for LecB over the host lectin Langerin .

Binding of C - glyocosides 6a , 7a and L - fucose ( 8 ) to Langerin as determined in a 19 F R 2 - filtered NMR competitive binding assay . In addition to the direct binding to one host lectin , a more global effect of the glycomimetics on immune homeostasis was investigated . Primary murine spleen cells were stimulated via different pathways using bacterial lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , fungal mannan or a combination of phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ( PMA ) and ionomycin , and the immune response to these stimuli in presence and absence of compounds 1 , 2a , 3a , 6a , 7a , or 11 was monitored by quantifying TNF - α release ( Figure S6 ) . No effect of mannoside 1 on the TNF - α levels was observed in comparison to matched DMSO concentrations ( Figure S6A ) , while cinnamide 2a showed a decrease in TNF - α levels ( Figure S6B ) . An immune suppressive effect was exclusively observed for cinnamide 2a at the highest concentration tested ( 1 mM ) , while all other tested compounds , 3a , 6a , 7a and 11 , showed no effect on the immune response ( Figure S6C ) . The immune - suppressive effect of 2a is an interesting observation , however , the high concentration needed probably impedes further development towards this effect . Excluding mannose - derived cinnamide 2a , none of the other Page 16 of 25 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Journal of the American Chemical Society 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960 17 compounds tested showed any effect on the immune response and provided further supporting evidence for compound selectivity . In vitro metabolic stability and toxicity To achieve effective compound concentrations in vivo , efficient compound uptake and stability towards host metabolism are crucial properties . Compound solubility is not considered problematic for these well soluble carbohydrate derivatives . Calculated compound lipophilicity ( clogP ) showed reasonable values ( - 1 . 25 < clogP < - 0 . 13 ) for all compounds selected for early pharmacokinetics and toxicity studies , i . e . sulfonamide C - glycosides 7a , b derivatives and the two mannose - based compounds 3a and 3b ( Table S5 ) . In vitro metabolic stability of the LecB inhibitors was studied against mouse and human liver microsomes and murine plasma ( Tables S6 , S7 , Figure S7 ) . The data obtained revealed a low intrinsic clearance ( CL int ) by mouse and human liver microsomes for all tested compounds . The metabolic stability of the C - glycoside 7a ( CL int 12 µL / min / mg protein ) towards mouse microsomes was slightly improved compared to its O - glycoside analog 3a ( CL int 19 µL / min / mg protein ) supporting the initial rational design of these C - glycosides . In the second group , the stabilities of mannoside 3b and C - glycoside 7b could not be differentiated since both compounds showed highest stability in this assay . Remarkably , all tested compounds showed very low clearance by human liver microsomes , where all substances fell into the highest stability category of this assay . Stability in murine plasma was assessed and while the positive controls procaine and propoxycaine were rapidly degraded , all analyzed LecB ligands were as stable as the negative control procainamide and were not significantly degraded during the incubation period of two hours . Therefore , all compounds tested can also be considered stable in murine plasma .

No toxicity was detected for all compounds tested up to a concentration of 100 µM . In vivo pharmacokinetics of C - glycosides The two candidates from the sulfonamides 7 with potent anti - biofilm effects and favorable ADME properties , i . e . 7a and 7b , were chosen for an in vivo pharmacokinetics study in mice . Male CD - 1 mice received a single dose of either 7a or 7b ( 10 mg / kg ; n = 3 ) intravenously ( i . v . ) or perorally ( p . o . ) . Plasma and urine levels of the parent compounds were monitored during 24 h ( Figure 8 ) and pharmacokinetic parameters of 7a and 7b were assessed from plasma levels using a one - compartment model ( Table S10 ) . 45 In general , thiophene 7b had a superior plasma concentration over mesitylene 7a achieving a two - fold higher calculated initial concentration ( C 0 13 . 4 µM for 7a ( i . v . ) ; C 0 28 . 3 µM for 7b ( i . v . ) ) and thus both candidates exceeded the anticipated necessary therapeutic levels ( concentration > target K d ) with 10 mg / kg i . v . . Furthermore , 7b showed a slower elimination rate ( k 10 ) , a prolonged half - life ( t 1 / 2 ) and mean residence time ( MRT ) and a low clearance ( CL ) compared to 7a . This resulted in higher compound levels in plasma at later time points . These features also contribute to an overall drug exposure in plasma for 7b at an AUC of 7 . 4 µg * h / mL using the intravenous administration route , which was around fourfold higher than for 7a . P . o . administration of 7a resulted in a bioavailability of nearly 100 % , whereas for 7b it was only around 33 . 5 % . However , the p . o . route of administration of 7b still resulted in a higher AUC than for 7a in the i . v . route . In addition , the p . o . route of 7b showed similar elimination curves as detected for the i . v . route . In general , both compounds , 7a and 7b , were absorbed rapidly ( t max : 0 . 26 - 0 . 51 h for 7a and 7b , p . o . route ) , which might be a consequence of the sugar - like structural elements inherited by both compounds facilitating the crossing of barriers . As unmetabolized 7b was detected in urine at high concentrations ( Figure 8 ) , its elimination from the systemic circulation likely proceeds via renal clearance rather than liver detoxification . The kidneys did not act as a Page 18 of 25 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Journal of the American Chemical Society 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960 19 reservoir and thiophene 7b did not accumulate in this organ since its concentration in kidney 24 h post i . v . dosing was below 6 nM . Taken together , both compounds showed good oral availability and thiophene 7b showed a superior pharmacokinetic profile compared to 7a with high compound levels , both in plasma and urine .

( top ) or p . o . ( bottom ) administration of compound 7a or 7b in a single dosing experiment ( 10 mg / kg , n = 3 ) . Dashed line represents the in vitro IC 50 range for both candidates with LecB PA14 . Conclusions We have developed the first low molecular weight LecB inhibitors that potently inhibited biofilm formation by P . aeruginosa , one of the prime mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance of this pathogen of outstanding medical importance . The synthesized glycomimetic C - glycosides showed Page 19 of 25 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Journal of the American Chemical Society 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960 20 inhibitory affinities as low as nanomolar for LecB variants from two strains representative for the entire set of clinical isolates . 20 Thus , it can be expected that the devised glycomimetics will be active against LecB - mediated biofilm formation in a broad spectrum of clinical isolates . The compounds showed excellent biophysical properties with receptor residence times as high as 28 minutes and fully enthalpy driven binding to the target lectin , which are two important benchmarks for early drug development . In contrast to the ineffective natural carbohydrate ligands , our glycomimetics were potent inhibitors of biofilm formation without affecting bacterial viability . Thus , development of resistances towards these pure anti - biofilm substances is likely to be reduced , in contrast to this well - known problem for traditional antibiotics . 12 , 46 Target selectivity was then studied in binding experiments towards Langerin , a human fucose - and mannose - binding C - type lectin , as well as in a more global approach in immune - stimulated primary murine spleen cells and no impeding effects of the glycomimetics could be observed . All compounds tested showed absence of toxicity . Furthermore , a set of in vitro ADME experiments revealed good metabolic stability of the compounds against liver microsomes , murine and human plasma and a balanced lipophilicity that is important for oral availability . In a first in vivo experiment , the pharmacokinetics of 7a and 7b in mice revealed oral availability with high plasma concentrations and a subsequent primary excretion route via the kidneys . Consequently , high compound concentrations in urine were observed , suggesting but not limiting to an application in a P . aeruginosa urinary tract infection ( UTI ) model . It will now be of interest to evaluate the compounds’ anti - infective potential in a mono - therapy treatment against biofilm - associated infections and their synergy together with antibiotics for efficient eradication of bacteria outside the biofilm .
