The route ( s ) of productive EBOV internalization into physiologically relevant cell types remain unexplored , and viral - host requirements for this process are incompletely understood . Here , we use electron microscopy and complementary chemical and genetic approaches to demonstrate that the viral glycoprotein , GP , induces macropinocytic uptake of viral particles into cells . GP ' s highly - glycosylated mucin domain is dispensable for virus - induced macropinocytosis , arguing that interactions between other sequences in GP and the host cell surface are responsible . Unexpectedly , we also found a requirement for the large GTPase dynamin - 2 , which is proposed to be dispensable for several types of macropinocytosis . Our results provide evidence that EBOV uses an atypical dynamin - dependent macropinocytosis - like entry pathway to enter Vero cells , adherent human peripheral blood - derived monocytes , and a mouse dendritic cell line . © 2011 Elsevier Inc .

All known ﬁ loviruses belong to one of three genera : Ebolavirus , consisting of the ﬁ ve species Zaire ebolavirus , Tai Forest ebolavirus , Bundibugyo ebolavirus , Sudan ebolavirus , and Reston ebolavirus ; Marburgvirus , consisting of the species Marburg marburgvirus ; andCuevavirus , consistingofthespecies Lloviucuevavirus ( tentative ) ( Kuhn et al . , 2010 ) . Ebola virus ( EBOV ) , the type member of the species Zaire Ebolavirus , is responsible for recurring outbreaks of hemorrhagic fever in humans and non - human primates ( Ascenzi et al . , 2008 ; Feldmann et al . , 2007 ; Kuhn , 2008 ) . The EBOV glycoprotein , GP , mediates all of the steps in viral entry into host cells , including fusion between viral and cellular membranes ( Takada et al . , 1997 ; Wool - Lewis and Bates , 1998 ) . GP - dependent viral entry requires endosomal acid pH and GP proteolytic cleavage by endo / lysososomal cysteine proteases , suggesting that viral membrane fusion and cytoplasmic escape occur from a late endo / lysosomalcompartment ( Chandranet al . , 2005 ; Sanchez , 2007 ; Schornberg et al . , 2006 ; Wong et al . , 2010 ; Yonezawa et al . , 2005 ) . However , the speci ﬁ c pathways by which EBOV particles are internalized and delivered to these intracel - lular sites of membrane fusion remain incompletely de ﬁ ned . Early studies aimed at deciphering the EBOV internalization route indicated a requirement for an active actin and microtubule cytoskeleton ( Sanchez , 2007 ; Yonezawa et al . , 2005 ) . Other studies implicated clathrin - and caveolin - dependent endocytic pathways in EBOV entry ( Bhattacharyya et al . , 2010 ; Sanchez , 2007 ) . More recently , Quinn and co - workers showed that a RhoC - dependent pathway is involved in the uptake of vesicularstomatitisvirus ( VSV ) pseudotypesbearingEBOVGP ( Quinnet al . , 2009 ) . While our current manuscript was in preparation , two groups demonstrated a critical role for macropinocytosis in mediating EBOV entry into several cultured cell lines . These investigators also ruled out a role for clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( Nanbo et al . , 2010 ; Saeed et al . , 2010 ) . Furthermore , work by Nanbo and co - workers suggested that an interaction between EBOV GP and an unknown host cell factor induces viral uptake by macropinocytosis ( Nanbo et al . , 2010 ) . Multiple cell - surface factors have been reported to be involved in EBOV entry , Virology 419 ( 2011 ) 72 – 83 ⁎ Correspondingauthorat : 1300MorrisParkAvenue , Bronx , NY10461 , USA .

A recent study also indicated a role for the Tyro3 receptor kinase Axl in enhancing EBOV macropinocytosis in a cell - type dependent manner ( Hunt et al . , 2011 ) . However , the mechanism ( s ) of induction of macropinocytosis in permissive cells by EBOV GP and the role of speci ﬁ c domains of GP in mediating this function remain unclear . In this study , we con ﬁ rm and extend the previous observations that EBOV GP - dependent viral entry requires a macropinocytosis - like uptake pathway . We provide new evidence for this entry mechanism by electron microscopy , and show that it is relevant not only in cultured ﬁ broblast cell lines but also in physiologically relevant antigen - presenting cell types . We demonstrate that viral internalization by macropinocytosis is induced by the viral glycoprotein GP , but that the highly glycosylated and surface - exposed GP mucin - like domain previously implicated in viral attachment ( Lin et al . , 2003 ; Simmons et al . , 2002 , 2003a ; Takada et al . , 2004 ) is dispensable for this process . Finally , our work reveals an unexpected dependence of ﬁ lovirus entry on the large GTPase dynamin - 2 that is independent of clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Results Viral entry into Vero cells mediated by EBOV GP Δ Muc is restricted by macropinocytosis inhibitor EIPA Based on the predicted pre - fusion structure of full length EBOV GP ( Lee and Saphire , 2009 ; Lee et al . , 2008 ) , the mucin - like domain ( Muc ) exists as an external domain shielding the GP1 and GP2 subunits of EBOV GP . This raised the possibility that the Muc might have a role in inducing uptake via macropinocytosis in addition to its role in immune evasion ( Simmons et al . , 2002 ; Wilson et al . , 2000 ) . Also , Muc incorporates ﬁ ve N - linked and 12 – 17 O - linked glycans ( Lee and Saphire , 2009 ) that could potentially interact with EBOV co - receptors / adhesion molecules such as mannose binding lectin , C - type lectins and integrins to induce macropinocytic uptake ( Ji et al . , 2005 ; Takada et al . , 2000 ) . Accordingly , we tested the effect of macro - pinocytosis inhibitor EIPA ( Koivusalo et al . , 2010 ) on EBOV GP Δ Muc dependent entry in Vero grivet monkey cells . We pretreated Vero cells with EIPA and then exposed the cells to vesicular stomatitis virus ( VSV ) pseudotypes expressing either the VSV G protein ( VSV - G ) or EBOV GP Δ Muc ( VSV - GP Δ Muc ) ( Fig . 1a ) . As observed previously for full length EBOV GP ( Nanbo et al . , 2010 ; Saeed et al . , 2010 ) , EIPA inhibited infection by VSV - GP Δ Muc but not VSV - G . EIPA also inhibited cytoplasmic entry by virus - like particles ( VLPs ) bearing EBOV GP Δ Muc and a VP40 - β - lactamase fusion protein ( β LaM - VLPs ) ( Fig . 1b ) . We next directly examined the effect of Muc deletion on the pathway of viral uptake ( Fig . 1c ) . To monitor viral attachment , EBOV GP Δ Muc VLPs bearing an eGFP - VP40 fusion protein ( eGFP - VLPs ) were exposed to Vero cells at 4 °C , and cell - associated eGFP ﬂ uorescence was measured by ﬂ ow cytometry . To monitor viral uptake , cells with bound VLPs were warmed to 37 °C for 30 min , acid - washed to remove any VLPs that remained at the cell surface , and analyzed by ﬂ ow cytometry . As shown in Fig . 1c , EIPA had little or no effect on attachment of VLPs but substantially reduced their internalization into cells . Similar results have been observed with full length EBOV GP ( Nanbo et al . , 2010 ; Saeed et al . , 2010 ) ( data not shown ) . We also examined viral uptake by confocal ﬂ uorescence microscopy ( Fig . 1d ) . In untreated Vero cells exposed to eGFP - VLPs , the majority of ﬂ uorescent puncta localized to the cell interior by 30 min at 37 °C , indicating that extensive viral internalization had occurred . By contrast , in cells treated with EIPA , most eGFP ﬂ uorescence was associated with the cellular membrane at the same time point . Therefore , EIPA inhibits EBOV GP Δ Muc dependent viral uptake into Vero cells . The same concentration of EIPA also ef ﬁ ciently blocked ﬂ uid - phase mediated uptake of ﬂ uorescently labeled high molecular weight dextran ( Fig . 1e ) . These ﬁ ndings suggest that like full length GP , EBOV GP Δ Muc mediates viral uptake into Vero cells predominantly via a macropinocytosis - like pathway . EBOV GP Δ Muc VLPs colocalize with and induce the uptake of ﬂ uid phase uptake markers Uptake of labeled dextran at early time points is known to occur via macropinocytosis . We therefore tested whether EBOV VLPs and labeled dextran can co - exist in the same vesicles . As observed in Fig . 2a , as early as 10 min , RFP - fused EBOV VLPs colocalized with FITC - labeled dextran , thereby indicating that EBOV VLPs are taken up in the same endocytic compartment as FITC - dextran . The Pearson ' s coef ﬁ - cient for colocalization in this case was deduced as 0 . 84 . It is well known that macropinocytosis is mediated by ruf ﬂ ing of cellular membranes ( Mercer et al . , 2010 ; Mercer and Helenius , 2009 ) and agents that are internalized by macropinocytosis can induce the uptake of FITC - dextran . Hence we next determined whether incuba - tion with VLPs expressing GP Δ Muc could induce uptake of FITC - dextran , as is known for full length GP ( Nanbo et al . , 2010 ; Saeed et al . , 2010 ) . Pre - exposure to EBOV VLPs could induce uptake of FITC - dextran similar to the positive control phorbol - 12 - myristate - 13 acetate ( PMA ) in Vero cells ( Fig . 2b ) . These results indicate that GP Δ Muc can activate cellular activities that result in increased uptake of ﬂ uid phase markers . Viral particles bearing EBOV GP Δ Muc induce plasma membrane ruf ﬂ ing We used electron microscopy to further characterize the uptake mechanism of viral particles bearing EBOV GP Δ Muc . In contrast to clathrin - mediated uptake of rVSV - G , rVSV - GP Δ Muc induces mem - brane ruf ﬂ ing , which is characteristic of macropinocytosis ( Fig . 3a ) . Macropinocytic uptake of rVSV expressing EBOV GP Δ Muc particles was observed as early as 15 min post inoculation of Vero cells . Similar events are observed at 30 min post virus exposure ( Fig . 3b ) . These results further corroborate that uptake of EBOV is primarily mediated by macropinocytosis and that the Muc is dispensable for macro - pinocytic uptake . Actin , myosin and PKC inhibitors can inhibit EBOV GP Δ Muc - mediated viral uptake and infection in Vero cells We then tested the effect of other known inhibitors of macro - pinocytosis ( Mercer and Helenius , 2009 ; Mercer et al . , 2010 ) on EBOV GP Δ Muc - dependent entry . Treatment of Vero cells with PKC inhibitor ( rottlerin ) , actin polymerization inhibitor ( latrunculin A ) and myosin light chain kinase inhibitor ( ML9 ) selectively inhibit infection mediated by EBOV GP but not VSV - G ( Fig . 4a ) . These compounds also inhibited entry of EBOV GP Δ Muc VLPs in the β - lactamase assay ( Fig . 4b ) . Moreover , all of these inhibitors acted at the uptake step and did not affect binding ( Fig . 4c ) , which was also con ﬁ rmed by ﬂ uorescence microcopy ( Fig . 4d ) . The myosin motor inhibitor , blebbistatin , however , did not have any effect on EBOV infection in Vero cells ( Fig . 4 ) . These ﬁ ndings demonstrate that abrogation of protein kinase C ( PKC ) , actin and myosin light chain kinase inhibits EBOV GP Δ Muc uptake in Vero cells , thereby lending support to the possibility that like full length GP , EBOV GP Δ Muc enters Vero cells predominantly viaa macropinocytosis - like pathway . Pak - 1 but not Arf6 plays an important role in EBOV GP Δ Muc - mediated entry into Vero cells An important cellular factor involved in EBOV macropinocytosis in Vero cells is p21 activated kinase ( Pak - 1 ) ( Nanbo et al . , 2010 ; Saeed et al . , 2010 ) . Expression of the Pak - 1 AID ( auto - inhibitory domain ) 73 N . Mulherkar et al . / Virology 419 ( 2011 ) 72 – 83 signi ﬁ cantly inhibits ( P b 0 . 001 ) VSV - GP Δ Muc infection of Vero cells , whereas expression of the wild type Pak - 1 and Pak - 1 - L107F AID ( control ) has no effect . Pak - 1 AID also reduced uptake of EBOV VLPs as well as FITC - dextran into Vero cells ( Fig . 5b ) . These results show that like full length GP , EBOV GP Δ Muc uptake in Vero cells is regulated by Pak - 1 . Arf6GTPasesareknowntomodulatemacropinocytosisinacell - type dependent manner ( Donaldson , 2003 ; Mercer et al . , 2010 ; Mercer and Helenius , 2009 ) . We investigated the effect of expression of dominant negative Arf6 on EBOV GP Δ Muc infection to determine whether the Muc can in ﬂ uence other mediators of macropinocytic uptake . Our resultsindicatethatwhileexpressionofArf6DNreduceduptakeofFITC - dextran , it had no effect on EBOV GP Δ Muc infection as well as uptake ( Figs . 5c and d ) . These results suggest that the macropinocytic pathway mediating EBOV GP Δ Muc entry in Vero cells does not involve Arf6 . Dynasore inhibits EBOV GP - dependent infection by interfering with viral entry The macropinocytic pathway employed by EBOV GP ( full length ) is proposed to be independent of the large GTPase dynamin ( Nanbo et al . , 2010 ; Saeed et al . , 2010 ) and is believed to utilize C - terminal binding protein - 1 ( CtBP1 ) for the scission of vesicles ( Liberali et al . , 2008 ; Saeed et al . , 2010 ) . To determine what , if any , role dynamin plays in entry mediated by EBOV GP Δ Muc , we examined the effect of dynamin inhibitors on infectionby VSV - GPinfection . Infection of bothVSV - G and VSV - GP Δ Muc was sensitive to dynasore treatment ; VSV - GP Δ Muc was comparatively more sensitive ( Fig . 6a ) . Inorder to rule outthe in ﬂ uence of VSV core and also deletion of the mucin - like domain , we performed thesameexperimentusingadynamin - independent ( Quirinetal . , 2008 ) VSV pseudotyped with LCMV glycoprotein ( GP ) and VSV pseudotyped No drug d a V i r a l i n f e c t i v i t y ( % ) [ EIPA ] ( µM ) VSV - G VSV - GP Muc 0 20 40 60 0 . 1 1 10 100 b Infected cells ( % ) No drug EIPA β LaM - VLPs 0 10 20 30 c No drug EIPA EGFP - positive cells ( % ) 0 20 40 60 80 EGFP - VLPs Cells Cells with bound VLPs Bound Internalized Cells with internalized VLPs C C Acid wash WGA VLPs DAPI e 0 10 20 30 0 10 20 30 F I T C – de x t r an - po s i t i v e c e ll s ( % ) Time ( min ) EIPA Control Control EIPA PMA WGA Dextran DAPI EIPA Fig . 1 .

( d ) EIPA inhibits uptake of EBOV VLPs ( microscopy ) . Vero cells were pre - treated with drug vehicle ( 1 % DMSO ) or 25 μ M EIPA and then exposed to eGFP - VLPs .

Asexpected , dynasoretreatmentdidnotaffect LCMV - GP expressing VSV but inhibited only EBOV GP and VSV - G pseudotypes ( Fig . 6b ) . Consistent with these ﬁ ndings , dynasore also inhibited cell entry byEBOV VLPs ( Fig . 6c ) . Todeterminemore precisely where such particles were blocked , we imaged the location of eGFP - VLPs . We found that although dynasore inhibited uptake of Alexa - 647 - transferrin ( Fig . 6d ) , it did not block the uptake of EBOV VLPs as measured by ﬂ ow cytometry ( Fig . 6e ) . However , as observed in Fig . 6f , treatment with dynasore leads to more EBOV VLPs associating with the cellular membrane ( stained with rhodamine - WGA ) . Because our biochemical assay of viral uptake depends on the stripping of cell - surfaceVLPsbyacidtreatment , wespeculatethatdynasorearrestsEBOV uptake at a later step than EIPA : a step at which the VLPs are protected from extracellular acid . Role of dynamin - 2 in EBOV GP - dependent infection and uptake To independently verify that dynamin function was required for EBOV infection , we tested the effect of expression of a dominant negative dynamin - 2 on infection of EBOV GP Δ Muc in Vero cells . Expression of dynamin - 2 - K44A reduces infection of VSV - GP pseudo - types in a highly reproducible manner ( P = 0 . 0004 ) ( Fig . 7a ) as well as EBOV VLPs ( Fig . 7b ) . As expected , dynamin - 2 - K44A expression inhibits uptakeoftransferrin ( Fig . 7c ) andleadstoanaccumulationofEBOVVLPs at the cellular membrane ( Fig . 7d ) . The EBOV VLPs also colocalize with endogenous dynamin ( Fig . 7e ; panel 2 ) ( Pearson ' s coef ﬁ cient 0 . 52 ) . Though some endogenous dynamin - 2 co localized with transferrin ( panel 3 , Pearson ' s coef ﬁ cient 0 . 48 ) EBOV VLPs did not colocalize with transferrin ( panel 4 , Pearson ' s coef ﬁ cient 0 . 02 ) . These results indicate that EBOV VLPs and transferrin are not in the same vesicle ( Hewlett a b VLPs Dextran + VLP coloc .

Effect of macropinocytosis inhibitors and dynasore on EBOV GP - dependent infection in antigen presenting cells Macrophages and dendritic cells are proposed to be the ﬁ rst cell types infected by EBOV upon infection of the host ( Bray and Geisbert , 2005 ; Geisbert et al . , 2003 ) . Accordingly , we next tested the effect of dynasore , EIPA , rottlerin , latrunculin A and ML9 on EBOV infection in the Jaws mouse dendritic cell line and in primary human adherent peripheral blood - derived monocytes . Both EIPA and dynasore inhibited VSV - GP ( full length and GP Δ Muc ) pseudotype infection in both cell types ( Figs . 8a and b ) . These results demonstrate that EBOV entry into physiologically - relevant primary cells is also mediated by an atypical dynamin - dependent macropinocytosis - like pathway . Discussion EBOV GP Δ Muc is necessary and suf ﬁ cient for macropinocytic uptake Most viruses exploit cellular endocytic pathways to infect host cells . One well - characterized mode of endocytosis is the clathrin - mediated endocytic ( CME ) pathway ( Conner and Schmid , 2003 ) . Some studies haveshownCMEtohavelittleornoroleinEBOVcellentry ( Nanboetal . , 2010 ; Saeedetal . , 2010 ) , whereassomeothershaveimplicatedCMEina cell type dependent manner ( Hunt et al . , 2011 ) and in entry of HIV pseudoparticles expressing EBOV GP ( Bhattacharyya et al . , 2010 ; Hunt et al . , 2011 ) . Recently , two studies have suggested a predominant role for macropinocytosis in the uptake of EBOV ( Nanbo et al . , 2010 ; Saeed et al . , 2010 ) . Macropinocytosis is initiated by an external stimulus resulting in activation of receptor tyrosine kinases ( Mercer and Helenius , 2009 ; Mercer et al . , 2010 ) .

Mulherkar et al . / Virology 419 ( 2011 ) 72 – 83 also implicated EBOV GP in activating macropinocytic uptake in host cells . While the speci ﬁ c cellular determinant / s involved in EBOV GP - induced macropinocytosis are unknown , potential GP binding partners , including TIM - 1 , integrin - β 1 and mannose - binding lectins ( Alvarez et al . , 2002 ; Chan et al . , 2001 ; Ji et al . , 2005 ; Kondratowicz et al . , 2011 ; Nanbo et al . , 2010 ; Saeed et al . , 2010 ; Simmons et al . , 2003b ; Takada et al . , 2000 ) may play a role . Additionally , Axl , a member of the Tyro3 protein kinase family could facilitate GP - mediated and GP Δ Muc - mediated macropinocytic uptake in a cell type - dependent manner without directly interacting with GP ( Brindley et al . , 2011 ; Hunt et al . , 2011 ) . Based on its predicted three - dimensional structure , full - length GP is covered by a thick cloak of glycans that include a bulky mucin - like domain , glycan cap and additional N - linked glycans on the sides ( Lee and Saphire , 2009 ; Lee et al . , 2008 ) . Indeed , N - linked and O - linked glycans are known to have roles in endocytosis ( Ohtsubo and Marth , 2006 ) . We therefore investigated the role of the mucin - like domain ( which constitutes both N - and O - linked glycans ) in in ﬂ uencing uptake of EBOV via macropinocytsis and / or CME . Our results indicate that deletion of the mucin - like domain neither impairs macropinocytic uptake of EBOV in Vero cells ( Figs . 1 – 5 , Supplementary Fig . 1 ) nor increases virus uptake by CME as determined by little or no colocaliza - tion of EBOV GP Δ Muc VLPs with labeled transferrin ( Fig . 7e ) . Therefore , studiesaimedatdeterminingtheroleofotherdomains / residuesofGPin mediating entry by macropinocytosis are warranted . Role of actin , PKC and myosin in EBOV entry Macropinocytosis is characterized by vigorous plasma membrane activity in the form of ruf ﬂ es . Ruf ﬂ es are formed by outward - directed actin polymerization and contain several regulators of actin polymer - ization , disassembly , stabilization and cytoskeletal membrane attach - ment . Some of these regulators include Arp2 / 3 , VASP , WAVE , PKC and several classes of myosin ( Mercer and Helenius , 2009 ) . Our EM data ( Fig . 3 ) conclusively show that uptake of EBOV GP Δ Muc occurs via cellular protrusions / ruf ﬂ es . Our results using inhibitors of actin polymerization , PKC , myosin II , and macropinocytosis ( Figs . 1 and 4 ) lend further support to the hypothesis that uptake of EBOV GP Δ Muc requires mediators of macropinocytosis . Intriguingly , an inhibitor of the myosin light chain kinase ( MLCK ) could inhibit EBOV GP Δ Muc - dependent viral entry , whereas blebbistatin , a class II myosin ATPase inhibitor , could not . While phosphorylation of myosin II A and B ( by MLCK ) is required for association with actin and / or plasma mem - brane , ATPase activity of class II myosins can provide contractile activities for closure of macropinosomes ( Mercer and Helenius , 2009 ; Mercer et al . , 2010 ) . We speculate that the contractile activities of other classes of myosins might have a role in macropinosome closure in Vero cells or that myosin II could have an unidenti ﬁ ed role in EBOV uptake . Recently , phosphorylated myosin IIA ( by MLCK ) has been shown to serve as a receptor for gB in mediating HSV - 1 entry in Vero cells ( Arii et al . , 2010 ) . It will therefore be of interest to determine the speci ﬁ c role of class II myosins in EBOV entry . Role of Pak - 1 and Arf6 in EBOV entry Pak - 1 ( p21 activated kinase ) has been shown to be required during all stages of macropinocytosis ( induction , closure and traf ﬁ cking ) ( Mercer and Helenius , 2009 ) . Pak - 1 is an important regulator of EBOV macropinocytosis since expression of Pak - 1AID mutant as well as knockdown of Pak - 1 can inhibit EBOV infection ( Nanbo et al . , 2010 ; Saeed et al . , 2010 ) .

Mulherkar et al . / Virology 419 ( 2011 ) 72 – 83 like domainhas norolein in ﬂ uencing EBOV uptake by Pak - 1 dependent macropinocytosis . Arf6 is a GTPase that aids in recycling Rac1 to the plasma membrane and induces membrane curvature . Arf6 also has a role in plasma membrane remodeling and endocytic membrane traf ﬁ cking that is independent of Pak - 1 ( Donaldson , 2003 ; Mercer and Helenius , 2009 ) . We found that though dominant negative Arf6 ( T27N ) reduced uptake of dextran , it had little or no effect on EBOV GP Δ Muc - dependent entry ( Figs . 5c – d ) . These results indicate that macropinocytic uptake of EBOV GP Δ Muc primarily occurs via a Pak - 1 dependent pathway and deletion of the mucin - like domain does not target it to an Arf6 uptake pathway .

Mulherkar et al . / Virology 419 ( 2011 ) 72 – 83 large GTPase dynamin - 2 for macropinosome closure . Instead , they appear to use CtBP1 for this purpose ( Mercer and Helenius , 2009 ) . EBOV entry by macropinocytosis was shown to be dependent on dynamin - 2 in SNB19 cells but not in Vero cells ( Hunt et al . , 2011 ; Nanbo et al . , 2010 ; Saeed et al . , 2010 ) . Because the receptor tyrosine kinase Axl plays a role in macropinocytic uptake of virus into SNB19 cells but not Vero cells , it seemed possible that the use of dynamin - 2 and Axl by EBOV GP is linked . However , in our hands , both pharmacological and genetic approaches reveal a dynamin - 2 require - ment for EBOV GP - mediated , Axl - independent , entry into Vero cells ( Figs . 6 , 7 ) . This requirement is determined by the viral glycoprotein and not by the nature or morphology of the viral core ( Fig . 6 ) . Interestingly , the ﬂ ow cytometry assay for uptake showed that dynasore treatment had no effect on binding as well as uptake , suggesting that EBOV VLPs cannot be stripped from dynasore - treated cells with acid buffer and are likely in membrane - bound vesicles associated with the cell membrane ( Figs . 6e – f ) . The speci ﬁ c step at which dynamin - 2 mediates EBOV entry remains to be determined , but may involve one or more functions of this protein , including its control of Rac1 localization , actomyosin contractile activity , closure of circular ruf ﬂ es , and traf ﬁ cking of macropinosomes , ( Conner and Schmid , 2003 ; Mercer and Helenius , 2009 ) . Our results are in contention with two publications ( Nanbo et al . , 2010 ; Saeedetal . , 2010 ) thatconcludedadispensablerolefordynamin - 2 in EBOV macropinocytic uptake and entry . The reason for this discrepancy is unclear at present , but may relate to differences in the dynasore treatment conditions employed in each study . Additionally , while our experiments were performed with a GFP - dynamin - 2 - K44A enriched population ofVero cells generated by ﬂ ow sorting , Saeedetal . , 2010 used a more heterogeneous population of transiently transfected HEK 293 T cells in which dynamin - 2 inhibition might have been less complete . We also show that inhibition of dynamin - 2 reduces EBOV GP - dependent infection in a mouse dendritic cell line and human adherent PBMCs ( Fig . 8 ) . Although dynamin - 2 function is believed to be dispensable for most macropinocytic pathways , some reports have indicated a role for dynamin - 2 in PDGF - stimulated and circular ruf ﬂ e - mediated macropinocytosis ( Liu et al . , 2008 ; Mercer and Helenius , 2009 ; Schlunck et al . , 2004 ) . Recently , HIV entry in macrophages was shown to be restricted by dynasore treatment ( characteristic of non - classical macropinocytosis ) and entry of EBOV in Axl - dependent cells wasalsoinhibitedbybothdynasoreandexpressionofdynamin - 2 - K44A ( Carter et al . , 2011 ; Hunt et al . , 2011 ) . Concluding remarks In summary , when expressed on a VSV core or in EBOV VLPs , EBOV GP is suf ﬁ cient to activate a macropinocytosis - like entry pathway in Vero cells ( present study ) ( Nanbo et al . , 2010 ; Saeed et al . , 2010 ) . However , EBOVGPwhenexpressedonlentiviralcores , canentercellsby clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( Bhattacharyya et al . , 2010 ; Hunt et al . , 2011 ; Sanchez , 2007 ) . In addition , in certain Axl - dependent cell types , multiple endocytic pathways including macropinocytosis , CME and caveolin - mediated endocytosismaybe involved ( Huntetal . , 2011 ) . Our studies performed in the Axl - independent Vero cell line indicate that at least in this cell type , EBOV entry occurs predominantly via an atypical macropinocytic pathway . Our ﬁ ndings in adherent human PBMCs and the Jaws mouse dendritic cell line support a role for a similar entry pathway in these antigen - presenting cell types as well . Taken together , our results demonstrate that entry of EBOV occurs via a non - classical macropinocytic pathway in Vero cells , and indicate that deletion of the mucin - like domain of EBOV GP does not favor entry byothermodesofendocytosissuchasCME . Thismechanismrequiresan active acto - myosin network and Pak1 activity and is independent of Arf6 . However , unlike most macropinocytic pathways , the EBOV entry pathway appears to require the activity of the large GTPase dynamin - 2 . Materials and methods Cells and culture conditions Vero cells ( African green monkey kidney cell line ) , 293 T cells and Jaws ( mouse dendritic cell line , a gift from Dr Laura Santambrogio , Albert Einstein College of Medicine ) were cultured in high - glucose Dulbecco ' s modi ﬁ ed Eagle ' s medium containing L - glutamine ( DMEM , Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( Gemini Bioproducts ) and 1 % penicillin – streptomycin solution ( Invi - trogen , Carlsbad , CA ) .
