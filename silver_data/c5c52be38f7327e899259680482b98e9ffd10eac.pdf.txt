HITAG enables users to rapidly 17 produce libraries of cells , each with a different protein of interest C - terminally tagged is 18 based on a modified strategy for performing Cas9 - based targeted insertions , coupled with an 19 improved approach for selecting properly tagged lines . Analysis of the resulting clones 20 generated by HITAG reveals high tagging specificity with the majority of tagging events 21 being indel free . Using HITAG , we fuse mCherry to a set of 167 stress granule - associated 22 proteins and elucidate the features which drive a subset of proteins to strongly accumulate 23 within these transient RNA - protein granules . 24 Introduction 25 To obtain an accurate working model of the cell , we must first understand the dynamic 26 behavior and interaction partners for each of the thousands of proteins within it . A powerful 27 approach to interrogate protein function is through the use of protein tags which are often 28 appended to the C - terminus of a protein of interest , to minimize their influence on protein 29 folding and localization 1 , 2 . When fused to a protein , these tags enable a myriad of studies 30 such as the in vivo examination of protein localization ( e . g . fluorescent protein tag ) , the 31 affinity purification of a protein and its interaction partners from cells and tissues ( e . g . FLAG 32 epitope tag ) , or the rapid destruction of a target protein ( e . g . FKBP - DD small molecule 33 regulated degron tag ) 3 – 6 . 34 35 As CRISPR / Cas9 has simplified the modification of mammalian genomes , there has been 36 growing interest in tagging all human proteins at their endogenous loci to facilitate the 37 comprehensive mapping of protein behavior 7 . To achieve this goal , groups have relied on 38 homologous recombination to insert tags at the C - terminus of target genes or used non - 39 homologous end joining ( NHEJ ) to insert synthetic exons containing protein tags into the 40 introns of numerous target genes 7 , 8 . While powerful , these approaches still involve significant 41 amounts of labor for each line generated or can perturb protein function due to the tag being 42 inserted into the middle of the protein , respectively . 43 44 To fulfill the need for a scalable method of gene tagging that would minimally perturb protein 45 function , we developed High - throughput Insertion of Tags Across the Genome ( HITAG ) . 46 HITAG uses Cas9 in combination with non - homologous end joining to insert protein tags into 47 the C - terminus of target genes . Key to the HITAG approach is that the process occurs within 48 a mixed pool of cells wherein , at the end of the procedure , each cell harbors a distinct 49 protein that is C - terminally tagged . In analyzing the insertion events mediated by HITAG , 50 over 70 % were found to be “perfect” fusions between the tag and the target gene without the 51 insertion or deletion of additional bases . To enable HITAG , we developed a modified 52 approach to NHEJ - based insertions and an optimized selection marker which dramatically 53 improved the quality of tagged libraries obtained . Using HITAG , a set of 167 stress granule 54 ( SG ) - associated genes were fused at their endogenous locus with mCherry and the features 55 driving some of these proteins to strongly accumulate within SGs were explored . These 56 results demonstrate the utility of HITAG and provide a means for the scaled interrogation of 57 protein function and behavior across cell types and cellular states . 58 59 Results 60 Generating pools of tagged cells using Cas9 + NHEJ 61 To develop HITAG , we began with a previously reported method of NHEJ - based 62 endogenous gene tagging termed CRISPaint 9 . In CRISPaint , a donor plasmid containing the 63 tag to be inserted into the genome is transfected into cells . Along with the donor plasmid , 3 64 other plasmids containing Cas9 , a gRNA against the C - terminus of the gene to be tagged 65 ( target - gRNA ) , and a gRNA against the donor plasmid ( donor - gRNA ) are also delivered 66 ( Supplementary Figure 1 ) . Once all plasmids are inside the cell , Cas9 complexes with the 67 target - gRNA and the donor - gRNA to cut the target gene and the donor plasmid , respectively . 68 The cleaved donor plasmid can then become inserted into the endogenous locus via NHEJ . 69 If the tag gets knocked in - frame to the gene of interest , it will also lead to the expression of a 70 downstream drug - resistant marker , enabling the facile enrichment of properly tagged cells by 71 applying drug selection . 72 73 While powerful , CRISPaint is limited in that it can only be applied to one target gene at a 74 time , making it laborious to study a large number of genes . To adapt this system into one 75 suitable for rapidly generating libraries of tagged lines , the requirement for performing 76 independent transfections for each target gene needed to be removed . To address this 77 bottleneck , a mixture of target - gRNAs was packaged into lentiviruses and delivered to cells 78 at a low multiplicity of infection ( MOI ~ 0 . 1 ) to ensure that on average , each cell integrates at 79 most a single target - gRNA into its genome . This pool of cells was then transfected en masse 80 with the remaining components required for tagging ( Cas9 , donor plasmid , donor - gRNA ) , 81 thereby enabling each cell to uniquely tag the gene to which its integrated target - gRNA is 82 directed ( Figure 1a ) . Finally , to enrich properly tagged cells , a round of drug selection was 83 applied . 84 85 In optimizing this high - throughput approach , we sought to avoid competition between the 86 target - gRNA and donor - gRNA for complexing with Cas9 , since if competition did occur , it 87 would interfere with either cleavage of the endogenous locus or the donor plasmid and in 88 doing so decrease the rate of knock - in 10 , 11 . To achieve this goal , two orthogonal Cas9 89 proteins , SpCas9 and SaCas9 , were employed , each of which interacts with a unique gRNA 90 scaffold . In our design , SpCas9 is used to cleave the endogenous target gene and SaCas9 91 is directed to linearize the donor plasmid ( Supplementary Figure 2 ) . Another benefit of 92 using two orthogonal Cas9 proteins is that properly tagged genes will not be recut , which 93 can occur when only using a single Cas9 protein should the target gene and the donor 94 plasmid have a similar sequence proximal to their PAM sites ( Supplementary Figure 3 ) . 95 Finally , to reduce off - target insertions which can occur if the donor - gRNA were to 96 inappropriately cleave the genome , several different SaCas9 donor - gRNAs were examined . 97 From this analysis , a donor - gRNA that showed high tagging efficiency and specificity was 98 identified and used throughout the remainder of the study ( Supplementary Figure 4 ) . As a 99 “perfect” fusion , without the loss or addition of bases , is the most common repair outcome 100 from tagging , we developed three donor plasmids that upon fusion to the target gene will 101 place the tag in the appropriate translational reading frame ( Supplementary Figure 5 ) 9 . This 102 design enables users to achieve precise tagging by selecting an optimal donor plasmid 103 depending upon the location within the C - terminal codon where the target gene is cut by 104 Cas9 . 105 106 Having established our initial approach to tagging , we applied it to gain insight into stress 107 granules ( SG ) , which are transient liquid - liquid phase separated ( LLPS ) RNA - protein 108 complexes that form in response to environmental stress 12 , 13 . We hypothesized that by 109 tagging a large number of SG - associated proteins with the fluorescent protein , mCherry , we 110 could gain insight into the properties that drive some proteins to strongly accumulate within 111 SGs . Toward this goal , a 193 - member target - gRNA library against SG - associated proteins 112 was designed and delivered to HEK293T cells ( Figure 1a ) . Into the resulting mixture of cells , 113 the remaining plasmids required for tagging were transfected in and puromycin - resistant 114 cells were then selected . To determine the bias in tagging in the resulting library , the 115 abundance of each gRNA within the population of cells before and after the procedure was 116 determined ( Figure 1b ) . As expected , the distribution of gRNAs in the initial population of 117 cells before mCherry knock - in was even , with no gRNA dominating the pool . In contrast , 118 after mCherry insertion and puromycin selection , a marked skew in the population was 119 observed with 5 gRNAs occupying more than 60 % of the pool , suggesting that only a 120 handful of genes were efficiently tagged during our initial attempt and that further 121 optimization was required . 122 123 Optimizing insertion rates and drug selection steps 124 As numerous genes were poorly targeted in our initial library , we first sought to improve the 125 efficiency of the process by optimizing the ratio of the transfected plasmids . Using a 126 HEK293T cell line that stably expressed a single target - gRNA against the histone gene , 127 HIST1H4C , 10ng or 100ng of each of the plasmids required for tagging ( Cas9 , donor 128 plasmid , donor - gRNA ) were delivered ( Figure 1c ) . These studies revealed that a higher 129 amount of the donor plasmid ( 100ng ) and a lower amount of the donor - gRNA ( 10ng ) led to a 130 significant increase in the number of mCherry - positive cells , before the application of drug 131 selection . Further optimization of the transfection conditions demonstrated an upper limit to 132 the benefit of delivering more donor plasmid ( 500ng ) , improvements by adding additional 133 Cas9 plasmid ( 100ng ) , and a decrease in insertion rates when the amount of donor - gRNA is 134 further reduced relative to the amount of donor plasmid ( Figure 1c ) . These results indicate 135 that the amount of cleaved donor plasmid is a major factor determining the tagging efficiency 136 and suggest that cutting the donor plasmid too early or too late via increased or decreased 137 amounts of donor - gRNA , respectively is detrimental . 138 139 Given that the puromycin resistance marker is under the regulation of the endogenous gene 140 that is tagged , we next hypothesized that weakly transcribed genes may not produce enough 141 of the resistance protein to survive drug selection . To increase the level of puromycin 142 resistance conferred upon tagging , a modified donor plasmid ( P3 ) was constructed 143 containing three tandem copies of the puromycin resistance gene downstream of the 144 mCherry tag ( Figure 1d ) . As a control , a donor plasmid with three copies of the puromycin 145 resistance gene downstream of mCherry , but containing a stop codon after the first PuroR 146 copy was also constructed ( P3S ) . These modified donor plasmids along with the original 147 donor plasmid with one copy of the PuroR gene ( P1 ) were then transfected independently 148 along with Cas9 and the donor - gRNA into HEK293T cells containing a single target - gRNA 149 against one of three target genes , HIST1H4C , CCT7 , or NUP93 . Minimal difference in the 150 number of mCherry - positive cells before puromycin selection was observed among the 151 different donors ( Figure 1e ) . In contrast , the number of viable cells dramatically increased 152 after puromycin selection using the P3 donor plasmid which expresses the three copies of 153 the puromycin resistance gene ( Figure 1f ) . These results suggest that in our initial approach , 154 many properly tagged cells were likely lost due to insufficient expression of the drug 155 selection marker . 156 157 Upon applying the improved transfection conditions and optimized P3 donor plasmid design 158 to the initial 193 - member SG target - gRNA library , a marked improvement in the number of 159 tagged genes was observed . Of the genes that were tagged in the pool , 29 genes showed 160 an abundance > 1 % following puromycin selection as compared to only 8 genes meeting this 161 threshold in the initial approach ( Figure 1b ) . In addition , a strong correlation ( ρ = 0 . 78 ) among 162 independent biological replicates was also found , suggesting that the tagging was efficient 163 and reproducible ( Supplementary Figure 6 ) . We designated this optimized pipeline for 164 generating pools of tagged cells HITAG . 165 Application of HITAG to stress granule factors 166 To ensure optimal tagging , our initial library of 193 SG targets had been selected such that 167 they all shared the same reading frame upon being cut by Cas9 . To tag the remaining 168 proteins previously associated with SGs , two additional target - gRNA libraries of 190 and 205 169 members were created and used to generate additional pools of mCherry - tagged cells via 170 the HITAG approach . 171 172 To characterize the fidelity of HITAG , the junctions between the various target genes and the 173 inserted mCherry tag ( junction reads ) were selectively enriched via nested PCR . From these 174 analyses , 244 of the 588 genes that were targeted across the three reading frame libraries 175 were tagged and survived drug selection ( Supplementary Figure 7 ) . The number of 176 junction reads associated with each tagged gene was then compared to its respective target - 177 gRNA abundance within the same pool of cells . As anticipated , a good correlation between 178 these two metrics was observed ( ρ = 0 . 84 ) , as would be expected if the target - gRNA within 179 each cell was driving the tagging events . In addition , these data point to target - gRNA 180 abundance being an easy - to - quantify surrogate for which genes are tagged within the library 181 ( Figure 2a ) . 182 183 While HITAG was able to target a large proportion of the genes within the library , many 184 failed to be tagged . To investigate the factors influencing these results , the characteristics of 185 tagged and untagged genes were interrogated . Given our previous findings regarding the 186 expression of the puromycin resistance marker limiting the efficiency of selection , we first 187 examined if gene expression influenced tagging efficiency . On average tagged genes 188 showed a higher level of expression as compared to untagged genes ( Figure 2b ) . Despite 189 the overall importance of gene expression , several genes showed high expression but 190 remained poorly targeted . To reduce the number of amino acids lost from the C - terminus of 191 our proteins of interest , gRNAs were selected based on their proximity to the stop codon . We 192 hypothesized that a portion of the variation in tagging may be driven by inefficient target - 193 gRNAs that poorly cut the endogenous target site . To investigate this hypothesis , we 194 obtained a predicted activity score for each gRNA using CRISPick and found that tagged 195 genes on average had target - gRNAs with significantly higher predicted activity 14 ( Figure 2c ) . 196 197 A concern when using NHEJ to insert DNA sequences into endogenous loci is that it can 198 lead to error - prone repair with additional bases being lost from both the target gene and 199 donor construct . When analyzing the sequenced junctions from the pool of mCherry - tagged 200 cells , 73 . 6 % of all junctions were precise fusions between the endogenous locus and the 201 donor plasmid , in line with previous studies 9 , 15 ( Figure 2d ) . Of the remaining junctions , 21 . 7 % 202 retained the proper frame between the gene of interest and the mCherry tag but showed a 203 loss or gain of bases , with a strong bias towards smaller 1 - 2 amino acid deletions and 204 insertions within the observed repair products ( Figure 2d and Supplementary Figure 8 ) . 205 The remaining 4 . 7 % of the repaired junctions were out - of - frame products , presumed to have 206 arisen from cells that have both a properly tagged allele conferring drug resistance and an 207 out - of - frame allele . 208 209 To investigate whether the HITAG approach can be applied to other cell lines , a set of 205 210 stress granule - associated genes were tagged with mCherry using the human colorectal 211 carcinoma cell line , HCT116 ( Supplementary Figure 9 ) . The features of tagging such as 212 the efficiency , specificity , overall repair profile , and biases in tagging were similar between 213 HCT116 and HEK293T cells , in line with HITAG being a generalizable method for tagging 214 genes in high - throughput . 215 216 Characterization of tagged proteins and their association with stress granules 217 To examine the behavior of the mCherry - tagged proteins within our mixed pool , single cells 218 were isolated , grown clonally , and the gRNA inside each was sequenced ( for details see 219 materials and methods ) . Within the 806 clonal lines obtained , 167 unique proteins were 220 mCherry tagged , with each protein being represented by a median of 3 clonal isolates 221 ( Supplementary Figure 10 ) . To quantify the rates of improper tagging , proteins that were 222 tagged within at least 10 independent isolates and showed distinct subcellular localization 223 ( e . g . nuclear localization ) were examined ( Supplementary Figure 11a ) . On average ~ 95 % 224 of the clones for a given protein showed the expected pattern of mCherry localization . These 225 results were further confirmed for two targets , BCALF1 and HNRNPA2B1 , by using PCR to 226 amplify the junction between the target gene and the mCherry tag ( Supplementary Figure 227 12b ) . 228 229 To probe if the mCherry tag alters protein localization , the subcellular distribution of the 230 tagged proteins ( Supplementary Figure 12 ) was compared with the annotations listed 231 within the Human Protein Atlas 16 . Of the 155 proteins with localization data in the Human 232 Protein Atlas , 141 agreed with our findings . For the 14 proteins with conflicting results , 6 had 233 annotations in other databases 7 , 17 , with 5 of these agreeing with our findings 7 . As a whole , 234 these data suggest that HITAG generates a high percentage of cells where the label is 235 inserted as designed and that the C - terminal fusion of mCherry to proteins of interest rarely 236 perturbs their localization . 237 238 While there are hundreds of proteins that have been found in SGs , what drives their 239 accumulation and why some proteins are more efficiently recruited to SGs is under active 240 investigation . To probe these questions , all 167 clonal lines were treated with 0 . 5 mM 241 sodium arsenite for 1 hour to induce SG formation . Stress granules were then visualized by 242 staining for the canonical SG marker G3BP1 ( Figure 3a ) . Of the 167 tagged proteins , only 243 23 showed the formation of distinct foci that overlapped with the G3BP1 marker ( strong 244 accumulation ) , as determined by fluorescence microscopy ( Figure 3b ) . To determine if the 245 mCherry label might be affecting protein dynamics , 9 proteins that showed either strong or 246 weak accumulation ( no G3BP1 overlapping foci ) within SGs were stained with antibodies 247 against the target protein in wild - type cells and the results compared to our findings 248 ( Supplementary Figure 13 ) . Comparisons between the staining patterns showed that the 249 mCherry tag had a minimal effect on altering a given protein’s interaction with SGs . 250 251 In examining the 23 proteins with strong accumulation , several distinctive features 252 immediately became apparent . Among the hits , all showed predominantly cytoplasmic 253 localization and had associated RNA binding activity . In addition , the majority could be 254 clustered by protein - protein interactions into two groups centered around either EIF4G1 or 255 G3BP1 ( Figure 3c ) . 256 257 To further characterize the nature of proteins that showed strong versus weak accumulation 258 each of the proteins was compared on a variety of features such as protein length , size of 259 intrinsically disordered regions , abundance , charge , and liquid - liquid phase separation 260 ( LLPS ) propensity ( Figure 3d and Supplementary Figure 14 ) . Somewhat surprisingly , 261 features such as protein length or the number of protein interaction partners showed no 262 correlation with a protein’s strength of accumulation within SGs . Of the metrics examined , a 263 propensity to LLPS showed the greatest difference between strong and weak accumulators , 264 suggesting a critical role for multivalent intra and intermolecular interactions in driving these 265 proteins ' behavior within SGs . These findings are in line with the fact that during times of 266 translation inhibition , SGs form by stalled preinitiation complexes , containing EIF4G1 , and 267 their associated RNAs which undergo condensation upon interaction with key nucleating 268 RBPs such as G3BP1 12 . They also highlight the known role of protein - RNA and protein - 269 protein interactions in driving SG formation 12 , 13 . 270 271 As a whole , these results demonstrate that while many proteins may associate with SG , only 272 a relative few have the required features to enable their robust accumulation . In agreement 273 with this observation , several nuclear RNA - binding proteins were found to have high LLPS 274 scores but poor accumulation within SG in our dataset . Yet , previous reports have shown 275 that during times of stress , some of these proteins can become localized to the cytoplasm , 276 fulfilling the critical requirement we highlight , which then enables them to readily accumulate 277 within SGs 18 , 19 . 278 279 280 Discussion 281 Here we report the development of High - throughput Insertion of Tags Across the Genome 282 ( HITAG ) , a fast and accessible method for generating libraries of endogenously tagged 283 proteins . Although several methods exist for performing targeted knock - ins into the 284 mammalian genome , most allow only a single protein at a time to be targeted , are inefficient , 285 or place tags in between coding exons which can disrupt protein folding and function 7 , 8 , 20 – 23 . 286 By increasing the throughput of performing C - terminal tagging , HITAG will help facilitate the 287 scalable interrogation of protein function and dynamics . In future developments , the coupling 288 of HITAG with single - cell approaches such as pooled optical screens will remove the need to 289 isolate clonal populations post - tagging and provide a further boost to discovery throughput 24 . 290 291 Although all the proteins that were fused to mCherry in this study have been previously 292 annotated as stress granule - associated , only 23 showed fluorescent puncta that overlapped 293 with the canonical SG marker G3BP1 upon subjecting the cells to sodium arsenite 294 treatment 25 , 26 . While several factors were found to be associated with strong accumulation 295 within G3BP1 foci , cytosolic localization , the ability to interact with RNA , and a propensity to 296 phase separate were found to be among the most critical . In future studies , the generated 297 lines may be used in combination with live cell and single molecule imaging modalities to 298 better understand the kinetics and distribution of each tagged protein within SGs to gain 299 further insight into granule assembly , disassembly , and heterogeneity . 300 301 While HITAG can generate a diverse library of endogenously tagged proteins , several areas 302 can be further explored to improve the quality of the generated libraries . First , the correlation 303 between gene expression and tagging efficiency , in combination with the observation that 304 knocking in multiple puromycin resistance genes reduces our targeting bias , suggests that 305 lowly expressed genes are being lost due to insufficient levels of drug marker expression . To 306 overcome this limitation , additional copies of the puromycin resistance marker , beyond the 307 three currently being used , should be considered . In addition , efforts to identify more efficient 308 drug markers via the mining of metagenomes or performing laboratory evolution on existing 309 markers are additional options that can be considered 27 , 28 . Second , the finding that predicted 310 gRNA activity influences the rate of gene tagging suggests that Cas9 variants with reduced 311 PAM requirements may increase the efficiency of targeting by allowing greater flexibility in 312 selecting which gRNA to use while still enabling insertions to occur near the C - terminus of 313 the target genes 29 , 30 . In addition , although a perfect junction without any loss or insertion of 314 amino acids is the most common repair outcome observed during the use of HITAG , there 315 are still ~ 22 % of junctions that show a loss or gain in nucleotides . This raises the possibility 316 that one may be able to direct Cas9 to cut downstream of the stop codon and rely on error - 317 prone repair to process away the stop codon and place the tag in - frame of the protein of 318 interest . If this alternative approach was found to be efficient , it would increase the number 319 of gRNA available for use and may also reduce the number of amino acids that are lost 320 during tagging , which at present is on average two . 321 322 Acknowledgments 323 This work was supported by a Career Awards for Medical Scientists from the Burroughs 324 Wellcome Fund and NIH grant 1R21HG011855 - 01 to A .

Vectors containing gRNAs were cloned by Golden Gate using Esp3I as 355 described previously 31 . pCAS plasmid was constructed from a previous dual - Cas9 plasmid 356 ( Addgene # 107320 ) by replacing the 3xHA sequence with a P2A sequence using Gibson 357 assembly . pDNR was constructed from pCRISPaint - TagGFP2 - PuroR ( Addgene # 80970 ) 358 using Gibson assembly . To construct the modified P3 donor with additional copies of the 359 puromycin resistance gene two puromycin resistance genes were PCR amplified with 360 primers designed to add a T2A sequence on each end . These fragments were then 361 assembled into a version of pDNR that was digested with ZraI using Gibson assembly . All 362 plasmids were validated by Sanger sequencing and will be made available via Addgene . The 363 sequence of the P3 donor , pCAS , the target - gRNA , and donor - gRNA vectors are provided in 364 Supplementary Table 2 . 365 366 Target - gRNA design 367 To design target - gRNAs the CRISPick tool from the Broad was used with settings Human 368 GRCh38 , CRISPRko , and SpyoCas9 14 . Guide RNAs with Esp3I restriction sites inside of 369 them , a polyT stretch longer than 4 base pairs , or more than one exact match in the human 370 genome were excluded from use even if they were the gRNA closest to the stop codon . 371 Frame number was categorized as the number of bases required to complete the cut codon 372 after cleavage . 373 374 Construction of stress granule library 375 A list of stress granule - associated genes was collected from the existing literature 25 , 26 . These 376 methods identified SG proteins based on the biotinylation of proteins in close spatial 377 proximity to core SG components or affinity purification of SG followed by mass 378 spectrometry . Using this list a set of target - gRNAs against each gene was generated with 379 any target - gRNAs that would result in a loss of more than 6 amino acids from the C - terminus 380 of a protein being removed . The resultant list of target - gRNAs was then sorted into three 381 libraries based on the frame ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . 382 383 Three gRNA libraries with different frames were synthesized as oligo pools from Agilent . 384 Each gRNA library was then PCR amplified from the initial oligo pool and cloned into the 385 modified pSB700 vector using Golden Gate assembly as previously described 31 . 386 387 Construction of HEK293T cells containing a library of target - gRNAs 388 HEK293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco ' s Modified Eagle Medium ( DMEM ) + 10 % FBS + 1 % 389 penicillin / streptomycin and incubated at 37°C and 5 . 0 % CO 2 . On day 1 , HEK293T cells were 390 seeded at ~ 3 . 5x10 6 cells per well in 6 - well plates for lentivirus production . On day 2 , a 391 mixture of 600ng psPAX2 , 150ng pMD2 . G , and 450ng of the target - gRNA plasmid was 392 transfected into each well using lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer ' s 393 instructions . On day 3 , the media was changed . Lentivirus was harvested by collecting the 394 supernatant after centrifugation ( 500g for 5 minutes ) of the media on day 4 and day 5 . The 395 lentivirus stocks were stored at - 80°C in 1ml aliquots . To generate HEK293T cells with on 396 average a single target - gRNA integrated into their genome viral stocks were tested for 397 infectivity and cells were infected at an MOI of ~ 0 . 1 . 398 399 Quantifying the efficiency of tagging 400 When optimizing the tagging approach , cells were plated at a density of 5 - 7x10 4 cells per 401 well in a 24 - well plate with a media volume of 600µl . After 24 hours transfections were 402 performed according to the manufacturer ' s instructions with 100ng pCAS , 100ng pDNR - 403 gRNA , and 200ng pDNR being delivered . In cases where the amount of each vector being 404 delivered was changed an inert “stuffer” plasmid , pBR322 , was delivered to ensure that the 405 same total amount of plasmid DNA was delivered across all conditions . Media was changed 406 on the next day of transfection . 407 408 On day 6 after transfection , the transfected population was split to poly - D - lysine ( PDL ) - 409 treated 96 well plates at a density of 1 - 2x10 4 cells per well . The following day cells were 410 fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde for 5 minutes . The cells were then washed with PBS , 411 stained with DAPI for 5 minutes , and washed twice with PBS . The cells were imaged using 412 the ImageXpress® Pico Automated Cell Imaging Systems . Tagging efficiency was 413 determined by the number of mCherry - positive cells showing the proper localization over the 414 total number of cells as determined by DAPI staining of nuclei . 415 416 Creating HITAG libraries 417 To initiate the HITAG procedure target - gRNA containing cell libraries were seeded into 6 - 418 well plates at 2 . 5 - 5 . 0x10 5 cells per 6 - well . One 6 - well plate was used per library . On the next 419 day , HITAG plasmids were transfected with 5 times more plasmid and transfection reagents 420 used for the 24 - well plate condition . Cells were split 1 : 4 in media with 0 . 5µg / ml puromycin 7 421 days after the transfection . The selection stopped until the next day when the negative 422 control cells died out . Selected tagged cells were expanded by changing media . 423 424 A stress granule library of HCT116 cells was generated by going through the same 425 procedure as outlined for HEK293T cells except for the concentration of drug ( blastidicine , 426 5 . 0µg / ml ; puromycin , 2 . 5µg / ml ) , transfection reagent ( FugeneHD ) , and the scale at which 427 transfections were performed ( 4 T75 flasks ) was varied . 428 429 gRNA analysis 430 1 - 2x10 6 cells were harvested with trypsin and washed once with PBS . The cell pellet was 431 resuspended in 500µl Lucigen DNA QuickExtract reagent and incubated at 65°C with 432 shaking at 750rpm for 15 minutes . After brief centrifugation , the sample was incubated at 433 95°C with shaking at 750rpm for 5 minutes . gRNA regions were PCR amplified using the 434 following conditions : 98°C 45s , [ 98°C 15s ; 56°C 15s ; 72°C 20s ] x n , 72°C 2min , 4°C hold , 435 where n is the cycle number before the PCR reaction saturated ( usually between 20 - 25 436 cycles ) . The second round PCR was performed to add the Illumina indices : 98°C 45s , [ 98°C 437 15s ; 56°C 15s ; 72°C 20s ] x8 , 72°C 2 min , hold at 4°C . The PCR products were then run on a 438 2 % agarose gel and the band of interest was purified . Samples were then sequenced on an 439 Illumina NextSeq 500 . The resulting reads were then analyzed by either aligning them using 440 Bowtie2 or the MAGeCK pipeline 32 . 441 442 High - throughput isolation and analysis of target - mCherry junctions 443 Genomic DNA was extracted from 1 - 2x10 6 cells using the Qiagen DNA extraction kit 444 ( # 69504 ) . Enzymatic DNA fragmentation was performed using the NEBNext® Ultra™ II FS 445 DNA Library Prep Kit ( E7805S ) . 2µg of genomic DNA ( 500ng per reaction ) was treated with 446 5 minutes of enzymatic fragmentation . All subsequent steps were performed as instructed by 447 the manufacturer . The DNA fragments containing the mCherry sequence were amplified 448 through a nested PCR approach . For the first round PCR , 500ng of fragmented and adapter - 449 ligated DNA was amplified ( 50ng per reaction ) using a primer binding on the reverse strand 450 of the mCherry sequence ( see Supplementary Table 3 for primer sequences ) and another 451 primer binding to the p7 adaptor using the following PCR condition : 98°C 45s , [ 98°C 15s , 452 65°C 15s , 72°C 90s ] x20 , 72°C 5min , hold 4°C . After the resulting sample was purified using 453 SPRI beads aiming to capture all products greater than 100 bp in size . The second - round 454 PCR reaction was then performed using 50 ng of the first - round PCR product ( 10ng per 455 reaction ) using PJ3 ( Supplementary Table 3 ) and index primers under the following PCR 456 condition : 98°C 45s , [ 98°C 15s , 65°C 15s , 72°C 90s ] x8 , 72°C 5min , hold 4°C . The final PCR 457 products were then isolated using SPRI beads aiming to remove all products smaller than 458 200 base pairs . 459 460 To characterize the target gene - mCherry tag junctions , we began by constructing a 461 database of all genomic regions adjacent to the target cut sites . NGS reads were then 462 blasted locally twice , once against the database of target genomic regions , and once against 463 the three linker sequences , which differ by a few bases to maintain the appropriate reading 464 frame . Reads which featured at least 20 bases of alignment to genomic targets and at least 465 20 bases of alignment to linker sequences were analyzed by comparing the locations of the 466 alignments to the expected location based on the gRNA cut site . Insertions were identified 467 as sections of a read which did not align with either the genomic target or the linker 468 sequence , while deletions appeared as a difference between the expected cut site and the 469 observed cut site . 470 471 Generation of clonal cell lines and identification of the gRNA in each well . 472 The library of cells with mCherry - tagged SG - associated proteins was detached from a T75 473 flask and washed once with prechilled PBS . The cells were resuspended in Ca / Mg - free PBS 474 + 1 % FBS , filtered with a 50um mesh filter , and kept in ice . Before single - cell sorting , 475 SYTOX Blue ( 1 : 1000 , Thermo S34857 ) was added as a cell viability indicator . In preparation 476 for single - cell sorting , 96 - well plates were filled with 150µl of media and prewarmed to room 477 temperature . Viable cells were sorted on the 96 - well plates using Sony MA900 in the Single - 478 Cell Mode . Cells were placed in the incubator and the media from all plates was changed as 479 needed . Each well was confirmed visually to have one colony per well after 10 days . 480 481 PCR - ready genomic DNA was prepared by mixing ~ 2x10 4 cells in each well with 30µl 482 Lucigen DNA QuickExtract . After incubating the plates for 15 minutes at 65°C followed by 10 483 minutes at 95°C , 1µl of the DNA extract was used for PCR to amplify the gRNA sequence . 484 The same gRNA PCR conditions were used as described above except 35 cycles were used 485 during the first round of PCR . Read counts of gRNAs for each well were then analyzed . For 486 a gRNA to be identified in a given well it needed to be present at an abundance at least 3 487 times greater than the next most abundant gRNA in that same well . 488 489 Immunofluorescence staining for stress granule formation 490 Sodium arsenite stress was applied by incubating cells with media containing 0 . 5mM 491 NaAs2O3 for an hour . Cells were then washed once with PBS and immediately fixed with 4 % 492 paraformaldehyde for 5 minutes , washed twice with PBS + 0 . 1 % TritonX - 100 incubating for 493 10 minutes between each wash step , and blocked with Superblock TM Blocking Buffer 494 ( Thermofisher # 37581 ) with 0 . 1 % TritonX - 100 for 2 hours at room temperature . For primary 495 antibody staining , cells were covered with 100µl Superblock with 0 . 1 % TritonX - 100 and 496 primary antibodies ( G3BP1 , proteintech 13057 - 2 - AP , 1 : 1000 dilution ; mCherry , proteintech 497 68088 - 1 , 1 : 1000 dilution ) overnight at 4°C . After washing the cells with PBS + 0 . 1 % TritonX - 498 100 ( 15 minutes ) and Superblock with 0 . 1 % TritonX - 100 ( 15 minutes ) , cells were incubated 499 with secondary antibodies ( Goat anti - mouse , Invitrogen A32727 ; Goat anti - rabbit , Invitrogen 500 A32731 , 1 : 1000 dilution ) for an hour at room temperature . After one wash with PBS + 0 . 1 % 501 TritonX - 100 , cells were stained with 0 . 1 μ g / ml DAPI in PBS for 5 minutes followed by two 502 PBS washes . At this point plates were either immediately imaged or covered with aluminum 503 seals and stored at 4°C . 504 505 Collection of protein features 506 Three published algorithms including PSPredictor , CatGranule , and Plaac were used to 507 predict various scores related to phase separation 33 – 35 . The number of intrinsically 508 disordered regions , number and fraction of charged residues , hydropathy , and net charge 509 were calculated using CIDER 36 . All the scores were predicted with default parameters using 510 the dominant isoform . 511 512 Protein - protein interaction network analysis 513 The protein - protein interaction network was extracted from the STRING database , with the 514 network type set as physical network and a minimum required interaction score of 0 . 400 37 . 515 All of the text mining , experimental data , and databases were accepted as active interaction 516 sources . Orphan genes , without interacting partners , are not included in the final network . K - 517 means was used for clustering , and the cluster number was set to 2 . Visualization is made 518 by Gephi 0 . 9 . 2 , with different colors indicating different gene groups and node size indicating 519 node degree . 520 521 Figure Legends : 522 523 Figure 1 .

As all 562 proteins that showed strong accumulation were predominantly localized to the cytoplasm for 563 comparison cytoplasmic proteins were divided into those that strongly or weakly accumulate 564 into SGs . As an additional group , we included all other proteins that showed weak 565 accumulation but did not primarily localize to the cytoplasm ( non - cytosolic ) ( Mann - Whitney - 566 Wilcoxon test , ns = not significant ; * * * * = p < 10 - 4 ) . 567 568 Supplementary Figure 1 . Schematic summary of CRISPaint approach for NHEJ - based 569 gene tagging . Four different components - Cas9 , target - gRNA , donor - gRNA , and donor 570 plasmid - are transfected into cells and required for the CRISPaint approach . In CRISPaint , 571 SpCas9 cleaves the target gene at its C - terminus and the donor plasmid ( pDNR ) . Linearized 572 pDNR can then become inserted into the genome through NHEJ . The cells which are 573 properly tagged in - frame will express mCherry fused to the protein of interest along with the 574 puromycin resistance gene ( PuroR ) , which enables properly tagged cells to grow in the 575 presence of puromycin . 576 577 Supplementary Figure 2 . Schematic summary of HITAG approach for NHEJ - based high - 578 throughput gene tagging . In the HITAG approach , the target - gRNA is designed to interact 579 with SpCas9 , while the donor - gRNA is designed to interact with SaCas9 . The library of 580 target - gRNAs against the various genes of interest is first integrated into the pool of cells at 581 low infectivity such that each cell gets on average a single target - gRNA or none . The 582 remaining CRISPR components are then transfected in . This then enables each cell in the 583 population to tag a unique gene to which their target - gRNA is against . When tagging occurs 584 in - frame the protein of interest gains the C - terminal tag and a drug resistance marker ( e . g . 585 puromycin resistance gene ) is also expressed , enabling properly tagged cells to be readily 586 isolated via a round of drug selection . 587 588 Supplementary Figure 3 . Schematic depicting how properly tagged genes can be recut 589 when using only a single Cas9 protein . ( a ) When using only a single Cas9 protein , as is 590 done in the original CRISPaint approach , the properly tagged product can be recut if the 3 591 PAM - proximal base pairs of the target gene are identical or similar to those of the donor 592 plasmid . This occurs because the spacer sequence of the target - sgRNA with an accessible 593 SpCas9 - PAM site is regenerated in the final knock - in product . This recutting is then 594 expected to inhibit the emergence of perfectly tagged products . ( b ) Recutting can be avoided 595 when using two orthogonal Cas9 proteins , as is done in the HITAG approach . This occurs 596 because even if the final product that forms has homology to the spacer sequence of the 597 target - gRNA it will have a SaCas9 - PAM site proximal to it , and thus not be an appropriate 598 substrate for SpCas9 which has different PAM requirements . 599 600 Supplementary Figure 4 . Identifying efficient and specific gRNAs against the donor plasmid . 601 ( a ) The efficiency of three different donor plasmids targeting gRNAs ( gRNA1 - 3 ) was 602 assessed for the ability to add a C - terminal mCherry tag to either CCND1 , HIST1H4C , or 603 PCNA . To measure efficiency , the percentage of cells with the appropriate mCherry 604 localization as determined by fluorescence microscopy was quantified before the application 605 of drug selection . Frame refers to the reading frame of the donor plasmid when cut . As there 606 are three possible reading frames ( i . e 0 , 1 , and 2 ) that a given target gene could be cut in , 3 607 donor plasmids corresponding to each frame were prepared for each donor - gRNA being 608 tested . This enables the system to then cut the target gene and donor plasmid in such a way 609 that should they undergo a perfect fusion ( without the addition or removal of bases ) the tag 610 and drug marker will be in the appropriate reading frame . ( b ) The same donor - gRNAs as in 611 panel A were also examined for specificity by transfecting them in combination with SaCas9 612 and a mCherry - containing donor plasmid . As no target - gRNA is provided in this experiment , 613 all drug - resistant clones that arise are due to either low levels of stochastic double - strand 614 breaks or the donor - gRNA cutting an endogenous site in the genome to enable the donor 615 plasmid to then insert itself . Based on these studies gRNA2 was determined to be the 616 optimal donor - gRNA and for all subsequent studies was used . Three biological replicates 617 ( independent transfections ) were performed for all conditions and error bars represent ± 618 standard deviation . 619 620 Supplementary Figure 5 . Schematic summary of the results of tagging depending on the 621 “frame” in which the target gene is cleaved by SpCas9 . Here , the frame number is defined 622 as the number of nucleotides that must be added by the donor so that the target gene and 623 the tag of interest are in - frame . In the original CRISPaint approach , three unique donor - 624 gRNA are used against a single donor plasmid to generate each of the needed reading 625 frames , with each donor - gRNA potentially having its own unique set of off - target within the 626 genome . In contrast , HITAG employs three different donor plasmids that all work with a 627 single donor - gRNA . By designing each donor plasmid to have either 0 , 1 , or 2 bases added 628 it enables the same donor - gRNA , which is tested to ensure it has minimal off - target activity , 629 to be used across all studies . For example , pDNR ( Frame 0 ) is used when tagging a target 630 gene that does not require additional nucleotides added for the tag to be in - frame with the 631 cut gene . 632 633 Supplementary Figure 6 . Comparing gRNA abundance between two independent rounds 634 of HITAG on the same target - gRNA library . The abundance of each target - gRNA within the 635 pool of cells was internally normalized between 0 to 1 for each replicate .
