The membrane bending and GTPase - binding functions of proteins from the BAR - domain family Bianca Habermann Scionics Computer Innovation , GmbH , Dresden , Germany BAR - domains recently took centre stage in science through a report on the crystal structure of this domain in Drosophila Amphiphysin . Though only weakly conserved at the sequence level , the structure of the BAR domain shows striking similarity to the GTPase - binding domain of Arfaptin 2 , an effector of Rho - and Arf - GTPases . On the basis of this sequence and structural similarity , these two proteins have been classified as belonging to the same family , the BAR - domain family , and they probably also have similar functional characteristics . Presented here are the results of a database search for the sequence of the BAR domain of Amphiphysin and Arfaptin 2 . This search identified a variety of related proteins , most of which are involved in intra - cellular transport and especially in endocytosis . For example , the BAR - domain family includes Endophilins , GTPase - activating proteins of the Centaurin β family and Oligophrenins , the adap - tor proteins APPL1 and APPL2 that were recently shown to interact with the small GTPase Rab5 , as well as members of the Sorting nexin family . On the basis of the structures of Amphiphysin and Arfaptin 2 and the cellular role of Amphiphysins in the early steps of endocytosis , the functions of the BAR domain have been defined as a dimerization motif and as sensing and inducing membrane curvature . However , data on Arfaptin 2 and now also on the Adaptor proteins APPL1 and 2 suggest that another function of the BAR domain is to bind to small GTPases .

Members of the Amphiphysin protein family are key regulators in the early steps of endocytosis . They are involved in the formation of clathrin - coated vesicles by promoting the assembly of a protein complex at the plasma membrane and directly assist in the induc - tion of the high curvature of the membrane at the neck of the vesicle ( Lee et al , 2002 ; Takei et al , 1999 ; reviewed in Wigge & McMahon , 1998 ) . Amphiphysins contain a characteristic domain , known as the BAR ( Bin – Amphiphysin – Rvs ) - domain , which is required for their in vivo function and their ability to tubulate membranes ( Takei et al , 1999 ) . Other regulators of endocytosis include small GTP - binding proteins of the Ras superfamily ( small GTPases ) and their various effectors , which regulate cargo uptake , intracellular transport ( the Rab and Arf families ) and also the rearrangement of the cytoskeleton ( the Rho , Rac and Cdc42 family ; Chavrier & Goud , 1999 ; Takai et al , 2001 ) . Recently , the crystal structure of Amphiphysin was solved . This structure revealed a striking similarity to the GTPase - binding domain of Arfaptin 2 / POR1 , which is an effector of small GTPases of the Rho and Arf families and is involved in Rac - and Arf - mediated membrane ruffling ( Peter et al , 2003 ; D’Souza - Schorey et al , 1997 ; Tarricone et al , 2001 ) . Even though only distantly related at the sequence level , the BAR domain of Amphiphysin and the GTPase - binding domain of Arfaptin 2 belong to the same protein family , and therefore probably have similar functional features . Clearly , there are two functions associated with the BAR domain : ( 1 ) the sensing and / or induction of membrane curvature and ( 2 ) the binding to a small GTPase . The main questions that arise from the current data are whether and how these two func - tions can be combined in a single domain and whether they are connected to each other .

Both proteins form a crescent - shaped dimer of a three - helix coiled coil . Rac binds to the centre of the V - shaped Arfaptin 2 dimer . Iterated sequence profile searches with either the BAR domain of Amphiphysin or the GTPase - interacting BAR domain of Arfaptin 2 reveal a large range of proteins , most of which are involved in intracellular transport and especially in endocytosis ( Fig 2 and supplementary Fig S1 online ; Peter et al , 2003 ) . For exam - ple , apparent homologues that contain a BAR domain include the Endophilins , the islet cell autoantigen Ica69 family , the GTPase - activating proteins of the Oligophrenin and Centaurin β family , the Rac – interacting protein Bap2 α / IRSp53 , as well as the adaptor pro - teins APPL1 / Dip13 α and APPL2 / Dip13 β , and the guanine exchange factor Tuba . In addition , members of the Sorting nexin family ( Snx1 , Snx2 , Snx4 - 8 , Snx9 and Snx18 ) were identified , all of which belong to the subclass that contains a characteristic carboxy ( C ) - terminal coiled - coil region ( Worby & Dixon , 2002 ) . On the basis of the sequence alignment of the BAR domain , the domain is about 200 amino acids in length , which is in accordance with the GTPase - binding interface of Arfaptin 2 and the structure of the Amphiphysin BAR domain . The domain displays a coiled - coil - like nature with a characteristic set of conserved hydrophobic , aromatic and hydrophilic amino acids ( supplementary Fig S1 online ) . A wide variety of accessory domains can be identified within BAR - domain family members , which reflects their diverse nature and cellular functions ( supplementary Fig S2 online ; Peter et al , 2003 ) . Dimer formation by BAR - domain - containing proteins On the basis of structural studies of Arfaptin 2 and the Amphiphysin BAR domain , dimerization is a minimal function of BAR - domain - containing proteins . Arfaptin 2 itself forms a homo - dimer , which is a prerequisite for its binding to small GTPases ( Tarricone et al , 2001 ) . Amphiphysins also dimerize and it was sug - gested that the V - shaped dimer is able to sense and / or induce membrane bending ( Peter et al , 2003 ) . Among the proteins that contain a BAR domain , there is evidence that they can and some - times must form homo - or heterodimers . This is the case for the Endophilin and Sorting nexin families ( Ringstad et al , 2001 ; Worby & Dixon , 2002 ) , as well as for the adaptors APPL1 and APPL2 ( E . Yus , M . Miaczynska and M . Zerial , personal communication ) . Dimer formation by these protein families depends on their pre - dicted BAR domain . The Snxs , for instance , dimerize via their char - acteristic C - terminal coiled - coil region , which represents their BAR domain . Heterodimers are mostly formed between closely related family members , such as between Amphiphysin I and II , APPL1 and 2 , or between different members of the Snx family ( such as Snx1 and 2 , or Snx5 and 6 ) . Heterodimerization , however , has also been observed for distant members of the BAR - domain family , for example Amphiphysin II was shown to heterodimerize with Snx4 , an interaction that may link early steps in endocytosis to intracellular transport ( Leprince et al , 2003 ) . Therefore , hetero - dimer formation between distantly related members of the BAR - domain family may offer some interesting new insights into the crosstalk between different functional pathways . The BAR domain as a sensor of membrane curvature BAR - domain - containing proteins have been shown to bind to lipids and to bend membranes . Amphiphysins and Endophilins , the first such proteins to be discovered ( Farsad et al , 2001 ; Takei et al , 1999 ) , respectively form clathrin - coated vesicles and induce membrane curvature . Amphiphysins mediate the formation of clathrin - coated vesicles by assembling at the plasma membrane a protein complex that is required for disconnecting vesicles from the plasma membrane ( reviewed in Wigge & McMahon , 1998 ; Zhang & Zelhof , 2002 ) . Furthermore , on the basis of their ability to tubulate membranes in vitro and in vivo , Amphiphysins are thought to take part in the formation of a narrow tubular neck at the point of contact of the vesicle and the membrane ( Lee et al , 2002 ; Takei et al , 1999 ) . In the recent study of Peter et al ( 2003 ) , in vitro membrane tubulation activity was also shown for Arfaptin 2 , Centaurin β 2 , Oligophrenin and Nadrin . Initial work on Amphiphysins and Endophilins suggested that a short sequence stretch , adjacent to the amino ( N ) - terminus of the BAR domain is essential for lipid - binding and tubule formation by the Amphiphysins and Endophilins ( Farsad et al , 2001 ) . This sequence stretch at the N - terminal end was shown to form an amphipathic helix , thereby extending the helical backbone of the dimer at the tips . Together with the BAR domain , this sequence motif is termed N - BAR and can be found in a subgroup of the BAR - domain family , including the Amphiphysins , Endophilins and Nadrin ( Peter et al , 2003 ) . N - BAR is also detectable in APPL1 and 2 , as well as in some members of the Snx family ( Snx1 , 2 , 4 , 5 and 6 ) . Recent data now suggest that the N - BAR is only required for binding to lipids and not for the tubule forming activity of the BAR domain , even though tubule formation is more effective in its presence . Next to the N - BAR , in vitro mutagenesis studies indicate that two patches Rac Arfaptin ( monomer ) Amphiphysin ( monomer ) Arfaptin 2 bound to Rac Amphiphysin Fig 1 | Crystal structures of Arfaptin 2 complexed with Rac and Amphiphysin .

The proposed model of the BAR domain as a sensor of membrane curvature implies that the V - shaped structure of the dimer preferentially binds to curved rather than flat mem - branes , thereby either sensing ( as a means for localization ) or even bending membranes ( as a means for active membrane defor - mation ) . Interestingly , the adaptor proteins APPL1 and 2 not only require the Pleckstrin Homology ( PH ) domain but also the adja - cent BAR domain and presumably the N - BAR for proper localiza - tion to membranes ( Miaczynska et al , 2004 ) . Pursuing this train of thought , it could also be possible that the extent of membrane curvature negatively influences the association of a BAR domain with the membrane , as the curvature could increase to such a point that association of the dimer with the membrane is sterically no longer feasible . For many BAR - domain family members , lipid binding has already been demonstrated or is in accordance with their proposed cellular functions . Even though some members contain additional lipid - binding domains , for example the APPL proteins , these might not be sufficient for proper localization of the molecule in vivo . Furthermore , the proposed model of curvature sensing by the BAR domain introduces another level of selectivity of recruitment , because membrane association of a BAR domain would not only be influenced by the lipid composition of the membrane , but also by the membrane’s curvature . 1 E n d o p h ili n B E n d o p h ili n I E n d o p h ili n II E n d o p h ili n III N a d r i n S H 3 - B P 1 I ca 69 P I C K 1 APP L1 A P P L 2 A r f a p t i n 2 A r f a p t i n1 A m p h i p h y s i n I I A m p h i p h ys i n I O li g o p h r e n i n 1 O li go p h r e n i n 1 - I BR AP 1 T u b a B a p 2L B a p 2 α C e n t a u r i n β 5 C e n t a u r i n β 2 C e n t a u r i n β 1 G r a f 2 S n x 5 S n x 6 S n x 4 S n x 8 S n x 1 S n x 2 S n x 7 S n x 9 S n x 18 Fig 2 | Phylogenetic tree of proteins belonging to the BAR - domain family .

The BAR domain of the Arfaptins was shown to bind to the small GTPases Rac , Arf1 , Arf3 and Arf6 , as well as to Arl1 ( Lu et al , 2001 ; Tarricone et al , 2001 ; Van Aelst et al , 1996 ; Williger et al , 1999 ) . So far , at least in vivo , all known functions of the Arfaptins depend on the interaction with a small GTPase . The involvement of Arfaptin 2 in membrane ruffling , for instance , seems to be mediated by a direct interaction with small GTPases and is thought to work on a regulatory level through the remodelling of the actin cytoskeleton ( D’Souza - Schorey et al , 1997 ; Tarricone et al , 2001 ) . The residues involved in its interaction with Rac1 are located along the first and second helix of Arfaptin 2 , in a region that shows surprisingly low sequence conservation ( Fig 3 ) . Nevertheless , several other members of the BAR - domain family have also been reported to bind to small GTPases . Bap2 α / IRSp53 has been shown to be the intermediate between Rac and WAVE in regulating membrane ruffling through its direct interaction with both proteins , and binding to Rac is mediated by its N - terminal BAR domain ( Miki et al , 2000 ) . Ica69 has been characterized as an Arfaptin - related molecule that interacts directly with a small GTPase of as yet unknown nature ( Spitzenberger et al , 2003 ) . Furthermore , a recent paper reports the interaction of APPL1 and APPL2 with the small GTPase Rab5 via their N - terminal BAR domain ( Miaczynska et al , 2004 ) . Even though the adjacent PH domain seems to be required for in vitro binding of the proteins to Rab5 , deletion of only the BAR domain in APPL1 abolishes binding to the small GTPase in vivo , sug - gesting that the PH domain has a stabilizing function on the dimer . The APPL proteins associate with Rab5 : GTP on distinct endosomal structures . On stimulation with epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) , the EGF receptor is partly internalized through APPL - positive endo - somes and APPL1 and 2 translocate to the nucleus .

The release from endosomes and the subsequent translocation of the APPL proteins to the nucleus takes place in a Rab5 - dependent fashion , and GTP hydrolysis by Rab5 is required for releasing APPL . APPL1 and 2 therefore represent classical effectors of the small GTPase Rab5 . Even though only four members of the BAR - domain family have so far been shown to bind to small GTPases , the idea of a general binding platform for small GTPases is intriguing and , owing to the homology of the BAR domain to the Arfaptins , is clearly worth pur - suing . On the basis of our current knowledge it may be that many of the BAR - domain family members bind to and are regulated by small GTPases . What makes this domain interesting is the rather broad specificity of Arfaptin 2 to the different subclasses of small GTPases of the Arf and Rho families . It has been suggested that Arfaptin 2 is a mediator between the Arf and Rac pathways , so it may be that the BAR domain takes part in crosstalk between signalling pathways that are regulated by different classes of small GTPases . Bending and / or binding ? How can the two proposed functions of the BAR domain now be combined ? Membrane curvature sensing and induction by the direct interaction of the V - shaped dimer with a curved membrane is not feasible when a small GTPase is bound to the dimer . In other words , the two proposed functions are mutually exclusive , at least at the same time . Several possibilities exist for a separation or an interplay between the two functions ( Fig 4 ) . In the simplest case ( exclusive model ) , the two functions are separate : GTPase binding is a newly acquired function that only a subgroup of the family has at the expense of membrane interaction along the dimer . In this scenario , the BAR domain of a protein would either be able to sense and induce membrane curvature or else bind to small GTPases , such that if the ability to sense membrane curvature has been lost , membrane association could be mediated through binding to a small GTPase . In a second scenario ( sequential model I ) , membrane curvature sensing and binding to a small GTPase could be associated functions that occur successively , initially through the localization of the pro - tein to the correct compartment and then through its subsequent interaction with a small GTPase . In this respect and in the case of the APPL proteins , sensing membrane curvature by the BAR domain could be a means for proper localization prior to binding to Rab5 . Even though APPL seems to require active Rab5 for proper localiza - tion to endosomal structures ( Miaczynska et al , 2004 ) and Arfaptin 1 localization to Golgi membranes is also dependent on active Arf3 ( Kanoh et al , 1997 ) , one should keep in mind that the lipid composi - tion and therefore curvature of the membrane is influenced by the small GTPases ( Miaczynska & Zerial , 2002 ; Powner & Wakelam , 2002 ) . The localization of BAR - domain proteins to a specific mem - brane could therefore be independent of a primary direct interaction with a small GTPase . Even though purely speculative at the moment , a BAR domain could similarly unite active membrane bending and GTPase binding as subsequent events , whereby one of the two func - tions could regulate the other ( sequential model II ) . A candidate for a BAR - domain - containing protein that would unite both is obviously Arfaptin 2 , because it has been shown to interact with small GTPases and is , at least in vitro , capable of tubulating membranes . However , it remains to be shown whether Arfaptin 2 has an in vivo function that is independent of a direct interaction with a small GTPase . Finally , it should be considered that the BAR domain might also influence the curvature of a membrane by directly interacting with the GTPase rather than the membrane . It could be required to stabilize the association of the active or inactive GTPase to a membranous compartment and in this way influence the lipid composition—and curvature—of the vesicle . Conclusion The BAR - domain family contains a variety of members , most of which have a role in transport and endocytosis , with the BAR domain as their common factor . Whereas some of them have been shown to participate directly in vesicle formation and membrane bending , others act as effectors of small GTPases and both functions are dependent on the BAR domain . In the light of current data , the function of the BAR domain may therefore not be limited to deform - ing membranes or sensing membrane curvature . From experimental data and also from the sequence homology between BAR - domain members it is not clear whether GTPase binding and membrane cur - vature sensing and induction form a common feature of all BAR - domain family members . A lot of work still needs to be done to elucidate the functions of BAR - domain family members in sensing and inducing lipid curvature and in binding to small GTPases . Furthermore , such studies should discriminate between different models of the interplay between the two functions , particularly when they are combined in a single protein .

In the exclusive model , the BAR domain is either a sensor of membrane curvature or a binding platform for a small GTPase . In the sequential modelI , sensing membrane curvature takes place before interaction with a small GTPase , possibly as a means for proper localization . In the sequential model II , GTPase binding would take place before inducing membrane curvature . reviews ©2004 EUROPEAN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY ORGANIZATION EMBO reports VOL 5 | NO 3 | 2004 concept 255 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The author thanks M .
