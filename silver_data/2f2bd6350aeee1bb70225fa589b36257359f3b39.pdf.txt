ONCOLOGY LETTERS 20 : 283 , 2020 Abstract . Diosgenin is a type of steroid extracted from the rhizome of Dioscorea plants . In traditional Chinese medicine , Dioscorea has the effect of ‘eliminating phlegm , promoting digestion , relaxing tendons , promoting blood circulation and inhibiting malaria’ . Recent studies have confirmed that dios‑ genin exhibits a number of pharmacological effects , including antitumor activities . Through its antitumor effect , diosgenin is able to block tumor progression and increase the survival rate of patients with cancer ; ultimately improving their quality of life . However , the mechanism underlying its pharmacological action remains unclear . Once tumor cells reach a metastatic phase , it can be fatal . Increased migration and invasiveness are the hall‑ marks of metastatic tumor cells . Invadopodia formation is key to maintaining the high migration and invasive ability of tumor cells . Invadopodia are a type of membrane structure process rich in filamentous‑actin and are common in highly invasive tumor cells . In addition to actin , numerous actin regulators , including cortical actin‑binding protein ( Cortactin ) , accumulate in invadopodia . Cortactin is a microfilament actin‑binding protein with special repetitive domains that are directly involved in the formation of the cortical microfilament actin cell skeleton . Cortactin is also one of the main substrates of intracel‑ lular Src‑type tyrosine protein kinases and represents a highly conserved family of intracellular cortical signaling proteins . In recent years , great progress has been made in understanding the role of Cortactin and its molecular mechanism in cell motility . However , the diosgenin‑Cortactin‑invadopodia mechanism is still under investigation . Therefore , the present review focused on the current research on the regulation of invadopodia by diosgenin via Cortactin . Contents 1 . Tumor metastasis 2 .

Introduction Cancer is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide , it was estimated that 14 . 1 million new cancer cases and 8 . 2 million cancer mortalities occurred in 2012 , worldwide ( 1 , 2 ) . Metastasis is the most dangerous stage in the occurrence and development of cancer ( 3 ) . Clinically , numerous patients with malignant tumors present with metastases at the time of diagnosis ( 4 ) . Therefore , the prevention and suppression of tumor metastasis is a critical issue that requires attention . Tumor metastasis is a complex , multifactorial dynamic process ( 5 ) . Tumor metastasis involves the activation and interaction of complex signaling pathways in the tumor micro‑ environment , the invasion and survival of tumor cells in the blood circulatory system or lymphatic circulatory system , and the proliferation of tumor cells at target‑shifting sites ( 6 ) . Invadopodia is an important structure formed in cancer metastasis , therefore , it is considered promising to investigate the suppression of cancer metastasis from the perspective of inhibiting invadopodia . In addition , the topic concerning traditional Chinese medicine , including diosgenin suppressing cancer metastasis through inhibiting invadopodia has been paid more attention . The present review will discuss and summarize the potential molecular mechanism of diosgenin inhibiting the formation and function of invadopodia . 2 . Formation and function of invadopodia Several studies have demonstrated that invadopodia are formed in the early stages of invasion and metastasis of tumor cells ( 7 , 8 ) . The invadopodium is an essential structure that is Inhibition of invadopodia formation by diosgenin in tumor cells ( Review ) YAXIN LIAN 1 , DEZHONG WEN 2 , XIAOTING MENG 1 , XIAOZHEN WANG 3 , HONGCHENG LI 4 , LIMING HAO 1 , HUI XUE 1 and JIA ZHAO 1 Departments of 1 Histology and Embryology , and 2 Medical Genetics , College of Basic Medical Sciences ; 3 Department of Breast Surgery , The First Hospital , Jilin University ; 4 GeneScience Pharmaceuticals Co . , Ltd . , Changchun , Jilin 130021 , P .

The invadopodium is a type of special membrane structure process that is rich in actin and involved in the degradation and remodeling of the extracellular matrix ( 10 ) . Electron micros‑ copy has revealed that invadopodia are slender , protruding structures ( 11 ) . The formation of invadopodia is generally divided into three stages ( Fig . 1 ) : i ) formation of the core of the invadopodia precursor ii ) stabilization of the invadopodia precursor and iii ) maturation of the invadopodia ( 12 ) . The core of the invado‑ podia precursor is formed by neural Wiskott‑Aldrich syndrome protein ( N‑WASP ) , the Arp2 / 3 complex and cofilin recruitment around the actin‑Cortactin complex ( 7 ) . The core can be formed in a few seconds , but it is unstable ( 13 ) . After the core is formed , tyrosine kinase substrate with 5 SH3 domains ( Tks5 ) rapidly binds the core ( within ~ 20 sec ) ( 14 ) . Tks5 mediates the binding of the precursor complex to PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 located on the cell membrane to stabilize the precursor structure ( 14‑16 ) . Lamellipodin protein causes the MenaArg‑SH2‑domain‑containing 5 inositol phosphatase ( SHIP2 ) complex ( Mena is a well‑known cytoskel‑ eton regulator that regulates the assembly of actin filaments and modulates cell adhesion and motility by interacting with Lamellipodin ) ( 17 ) to be recruited as a precursor ( 15 , 16 ) . SHIP2 promotes the production of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 , which is beneficial for fixation of the precursor to the cell membrane and stabiliza‑ tion of precursors . Cofilin and Arp2 / 3 complexes mediate two different actin aggregation pathways , the cooperation of which greatly enhances further aggregation of actin ( 18 ) . Actin polym‑ erization then prolongs and forms the invadopodia , resulting in increased matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) content , degraded extracellular matrix and invadopodia maturation ( 12 , 14 , 19 ) . In other words , to break through the barrier of the extracellular matrix , tumor cells need to extend cellular protrusions , which reconstruct and degrade the extracellular matrix ( 13 ) . These types of cell protrusions are essential for the ability of tumor cells to break through the basement membrane and vascular wall ( 10 , 13 ) . The protruding structures ( protrusions ) formed by invasive tumor cells on one side of the basement membrane are the inva‑ dopodia , which are rich in actin regulatory proteins , adhesion molecules , signaling or receptor proteins , cell membrane recom‑ binant proteins , and matrix proteolytic enzymes ( 10 , 13 , 19‑23 ) . Invadopodia are involved in the process of tumor cell invasion through the basement membrane as follows : i ) The structure forms first , and then the invadopodia perforate the basement membrane ; ii ) the invadopodia then elongate and extend through and beyond the basement membrane ; and iii ) finally , the invadopodia lead to the migration of tumor cells ( 19 ) . As invadopodia are so important for cancer metastasis , an improved understanding of the formation of and regula‑ tory mechanism controlling invadopodia is critical . Research results in this field are expected to provide new therapeutic targets and directions for tumor treatment . 3 . Antitumor effects and mechanisms of diosgenin Research on the effects of artemisinin against malaria by Youyou Tu ( 24 ) won the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine . Therefore , the discovery of natural products from traditional Chinese medicine may be beneficial for the development of , and investigation into , innovative drugs for other diseases . Diosgenin ( Fig . 2 ) ( 25 ) is a type of steroid extracted from the rhizome of Dioscorea ( 26‑28 ) , it is the hydrolysate of dioscin and is abundant in Dioscorea ( 27 , 28 ) . Its multiple phar‑ macological effects have been confirmed in previous studies ; it has been demonstrated to exhibit antitumor ( 27 , 29 , 30 ) and anti‑inflammatory activity ( 27 , 29 , 30 ) , as well as improving cardiovascular function ( 27 ) , lowering blood lipids ( 29 , 30 ) , regulating immunity ( 27 , 29 ) , and inhibiting platelet aggrega‑ tion ( 31 ) . Diosgenin can also decrease visceral injury and protect visceral organs , including the liver ( 29 , 30 ) , kidney ( 29 ) , brain ( 29 ) and gastrointestinal tract ( 29 , 30 ) . Diosgenin repre‑ sents an important raw material for the synthesis of various steroid drugs ( 27 ) . Research has revealed that the toxicity and side effects of diosgenin are low ( 29 , 32 ) . Diosgenin inhibits the metastasis of various cancers , such as prostate ( 28 , 30 , 33‑36 ) , gastric ( 30 , 36‑38 ) , lung ( 39 , 40 ) , breast ( 30 , 41 ) , liver ( 30 ) , renal ( 30 ) and colon ( 41 ) cancer , and melanoma ( 29 ) . Diosgenin inhibits metastasis in multiple types of cancer primarily by suppressing constitu‑ tively‑activated pro‑inflammatory and pro‑survival signaling pathways and factors ( 42 ) , such as NF‑ κ B‑associated path‑ ways ( 28 , 42 , 43 ) , focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) ‑associated pathways ( 44 ) , p38 / mitogen‑activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) signaling pathways ( 42 , 45 ) , and Src ( 46 ) . Further studies have also found that diosgenin inhibits other functions in tumorigenesis , including tumor cell proliferation , apoptosis , epithelial‑to‑mesenchymal transition and angio‑ genesis ( 33 , 47‑51 ) . Shishodia and Aggarwal ( 42 ) revealed that diosgenin inhibits the invasion of human lung cancer H1299 cells via suppressing TNF‑induced NF‑ κ B activation . Li et al ( 28 ) found that diosgenin induces the expression of Src homology 2 phosphatase 2 ( SH‑PTP2 ) , thus blocking the STAT3‑associated signaling pathway , and also that it inhibits the development of human hepatocellular carcinoma . Diosgenin was demonstrated to inhibit tumor growth in both MDA‑231 and MCF‑7 xenografts in vivo by inhibiting Akt , the Raf / MEK signaling pathway and NF‑ κ B activity to induce apoptosis ( 40 , 52 , 53 ) . Therefore , diosgenin may be a potential option for the treatment of cancer ( 27 , 29 , 34 , 35 , 37 , 39 ) . 4 . Structure and regulation of Cortactin Cortical actin‑binding protein ( Cortactin ) has been demon‑ strated to be associated with cancer . Previous studies have demonstrated that Cortactin is upregulated in a variety of tumors , such as breast cancers and head and neck tumors ( 54 , 55 ) . It is involved in a variety of cell activities , including invadopodia formation and cell adhesion , invasion , migration and division ( 54 , 56 ) . Human Cortactin is encoded by the CTTN gene ( formerly known as the EMSl gene ) , which is located on chromosome 11q13 ( 57 ) . Cortactin protein has three main domains : i ) The N‑terminal acidic region ( NTA ) ; ii ) filamentous actin ( F‑actin ) repetitive domain ( ABR ) and iii ) the SH3 domain in the C‑terminal ( 54 , 58 ) ( Fig . 3 ) . The NTA binds with Arp in the Arp2 / 3 complex and can also regulate the polymerization and shrinkage of F‑actin ( 54 , 56 , 58 ) . The ABR is responsible for the binding of Cortactin to F‑actin ( 58 ) . The function of Cortactin is also regulated at the ABR via post‑translational modifications ( 56 , 58 ) . A study by Uruno et al revealed that ONCOLOGY LETTERS 20 : 283 , 2020 3 the number of repeats in the ABRs determines the affinity of Cortactin to F‑actin , as well as its ability to regulate cell migration ( 57 ) . The SH3 domain is a conserved protein module found in various signaling proteins that mediates the interaction with various other proteins , such as neural Wiskott‑Aldrich syndrome protein ( N‑WASP ) ( 59 ) , WASP binding protein ( WIP ) ( 60 ) and missing in metastasis ( MIM ) ( 61 ) . The tyrosine phosphorylation of Cortactin is usually associated with the SH3 domain or proline‑rich domain‑binding proteins ( 58 ) . The molecular structure of Cortactin changes after phosphorylation , bringing the SH3 domain closer to the SH3 binding protein , increasing the chances of binding ( 54 , 58 ) . Cortactin is the main substrate of the Src family tyrosine kinases , and tyrosine phosphory‑ lation serves an important role in the assembly of cortical microfilament actin ( 54 ) . Cortactin phosphorylation via Src kinase is required for invadopodia formation mediated by Cortactin ( 62 , 63 ) ; that is , the Src family tyrosine kinases may promote cell migration via the phosphorylation of Cortactin . Cortactin and its associated proteins perform functions in the cortical areas associated with cell membrane deformation and the actin cytoskeleton ; in pseudopods and cell wrinkles , these proteins enhance the formation and / or stability of dendritic actin networks ( 64 ) . 5 . Role of Cortactin in invadopodia formation and function Invadopodia formation requires numerous proteins ( 65 , 66 ) . Cortactin is an actin‑binding protein that is closely Figure 2 .

LIAN et al : INHIBITION OF INVADOPODIA FORMATION BY DIOSGENIN IN TUMOR CELLS 4 associated with invadopodia through its interaction with other proteins ( 67 ) . Cortactin is key for invadopodia formation and interacts with various proteins , such as Arp2 / 3 , N‑WASP , and F‑actin ( 7 , 65 , 68 ) . Furthermore , Cortactin activates and stabi‑ lizes the phases of branched actin assembly via the Arp2 / 3 complex of invadopodia ( 69‑71 ) . In addition , Cortactin can increase the endurance of invadopodia and promote molecular adhesion and cell movement ( 72 , 73 ) . Previous studies have reported that Cortactin phos‑ phorylation is associated with the rate of cell migration in a number of different types of tumor cell ( 54 , 55 , 74 , 75 ) . The upregulation of Cortactin promotes the formation of inva‑ dopodia , the degradation of the extracellular matrix and the invasiveness of cancer cells ( 54 , 61 , 76 ) . Cortactin is positively correlated with tumor invasiveness and metastasis and is closely associated with the synaptic membrane structure of tumor cells ( 54 , 55 , 61 , 76 ) . Other studies have demonstrated that Cortactin binds the Arp2 / 3 complex and N‑WASP and regulates the formation of invadopodia via the Nck1‑N‑WASP / Arp2 / 3 signaling pathway ( 76 , 77 ) . WASP family proteins can induce the rear‑ rangement of actin molecules in cells by activating Arp2 / 3 and thus promote the rapid formation and maturation of invadopodia ( 78 ) . Genna et al ( 79 ) revealed that the tyro‑ sine kinase Pyk2 activates Abl‑related gene ( Arg ) through the EGFR‑Pyk2‑Src‑Arg‑cortactin signaling pathway , and directly or indirectly mediates the phosphorylation and polymerization of Cortactin induced by epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) . This results in invadopodia actin polymer‑ ization , invadopodia maturation and enhanced invasion of breast cancer cells . Overall , the aforementioned studies indicate that Cortactin serves a pivotal role in the formation of invadopodia and the degradation of the extracellular matrix to promote cancer cell migration and invasion . 6 . Potential diosgenin‑Cortactin‑invadopodia mechanism Invadopodium is a convergence point for a number of signals that regulate tumor cell behaviors , particularly systemic dissemina‑ tion and metastasis ( 13 ) . Cortactin is the switch that mediates invadopodia formation ( 54 , 55 , 67 , 74 , 75 , 80 ) . It is regulated by numerous signaling pathways and factors , including the FAK pathway ( 81 ) , Src ( 82 ) , NF‑ κ B ( 54 , 55 ) , and other pathways that are closely associated with tumor metastasis ( 54 , 55 , 74 , 75 , 80 ) . Several studies have reported that diosgenin is closely associated with the FAK pathway , Src , NF‑ κ B and MMPs ( 43 , 83 ) . A potential mechanism of action underlying diosgenin‑Cortactin‑invado‑ podia is presented in Fig . 4 . In prostate cancer , diosgenin inhibits MMP expression and , therefore , cancer metastasis ( 33 ) , while MMP expression promotes cortactin , and both MMPs and cortactin are required for form and function of invadopodia ( 84 ) . This suggests that the potential mechanism of diosgenin involves the downregu‑ lation of MMPs , and inhibition of Cortactin and invadopodia , ultimately inhibiting prostate cancer metastasis . It has also been demonstrated that diosgenin downregulates the NF‑ κ B signaling pathway , thus inhibiting the metastasis of prostate cancer , suggesting another mechanism : Downregulation of the NF‑ κ B signaling pathway results in inhibition of Cortactin , and hence , inhibition of invadopodia ( 33 ) . In addition , diosgenin can inhibit colon cancer metastasis via regulating the Akt / MAPK signaling pathway ( 85 ) , while Akt can activate Cortactin ( 86 , 87 ) , thus suggesting that diosgenin downregulates the Akt / MAPK signaling pathway , which inhibits Cortactin and hence , inhibits invadopodia , resulting in inhibition of colon cancer metastasis . It was also reported that diosgenin can activate the p38 and JNK pathways and thus inhibit Cortactin in colon cancer ( 88 ) , suggesting that diosgenin inhibits the formation and function of invadopodia via the downregulation of Cortactin via activating the p38 pathway ( 89 ) . In breast cancer , it was revealed that diosgenin downregulates Akt , thus inhibiting the metastasis of breast cancer ( 40 , 90 ) , similar to the mechanism in colon cancer . Diosgenin can serve as a dual inhibitor of the MEK / ERK and PI3K / Akt signaling pathways to overcome tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance , resulting in clinical benefits for lung cancer treatment ( 91 ) . Furthermore , diosgenin downregulates Figure 4 . Potential diosgenin‑Cortactin‑invadopodia mechanism .

FAK , focal adhesion kinase . ONCOLOGY LETTERS 20 : 283 , 2020 5 the NF‑ κ B‑p65 / p50 and p38‑MAPK pathways and attenuates acute lung injury in mice ( 92 ) . In human erythroleukemia , diosgenin inhibits the NF‑ κ B signaling pathway and thus suppresses metastasis ( 43 ) . Diosgenin inhibits the activity and amount of transcription factor NF‑ κ B ( 40 , 93 ) , and can also inhibit the function of the FAK pathway ( FAK is a regulator of cell migration , prolifera‑ tion , survival and transcription ) ( 44 ) . In addition , it was found endothelial‑cell FAK is required for DNA‑damage‑induced NF‑ κ B activation ( 94 ) . It was revealed that NF‑ κ B activation can activate the FAK pathway , which is activated via FAK phosphorylatio ( 95 , 96 ) . Tyr397 is the main phosphoryla‑ tion site of FAK ; in addition to its autophosphorylation , Tyr397 can also interact with the SH2 domain of Src family proteins ( 97 , 98 ) to activate other phosphorylation sites , thus promoting the activation of the signaling pathway downstream of the FAK pathway and causing migration and invasion of tumor cells ( 97 , 99‑101 ) . Furthermore , Src promotes NF‑ κ B transcriptional activity ( 102‑104 ) , and Src and FAK also serve as a signaling pathway , whereby Src promotes the FAK pathway activity ( 99‑101 ) . The interactions between Src , NF‑ κ B and the FAK pathway are presented in Fig . 5 . It was also revealed that diosgenin can decrease the activities of MMP‑2 and MMP‑9 , and the two combined with NF‑ κ B form an axis ( 105‑108 ) . Inhibiting MMP‑2 / ‑9 can suppress the activity of AKT / NF‑ κ B in HeLa cells ( 107 ) , while suppressing NF‑ κ B can also down‑ regulate MMPs in nude mice which are injected HepG2‑HBx cells ( 108 , 109 ) . This suggests that the diosgenin mechanism of action may be extensive , involving multiple pathway links that are very complex . 7 . Clinical application of diosgenin On the basis of its various functions , diosgenin has been used medicinally to treat a number of diseases and improve several physiological functions . Diosgenin has been applied in many cases , such as treating inflammation ( 27 , 29 , 30 ) , improving cardiovascular function ( 27 ) , lowering blood lipid levels ( 29 , 30 ) and regulating immunity ( 27 , 29 , 30 ) . Traditionally , diosgenin was used for the treatment of various symptoms such as cold hands and feet ( by its func‑ tion of activating blood ) , loss of appetite caused by diseases including cancer , and frequent urination ( by its function of protecting kidney ) ( 27 , 29 , 30 ) . Currently , diosgenin is widely used for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases ( 110 , 111 ) . Several extensive clinical cases ( particularly for cardiovas‑ cular diseases ) have validated diosgenin as a drug for treating diseases ( 110 ) . In addition , certain studies have demonstrated that psychobehavioral interventions of traditional Chinese medicine can benefit patients with cancer by multiple roles , such as decreasing functional impairments , leading to pain relief , easing depression , decreasing time to flatulence following surgery and improving sleep quality ( 112 ) . Several traditional Chinese medicines , such as artemis‑ inin ( 113 , 114 ) , Danshen ( 113 , 115 ) , glossy Ganoderma ( 116 ) , and Huangqi ( 117 , 118 ) , have been used as anticancer therapies , such as being used as supplementary anticancer drugs and psychobehavioral interventions ( 112‑118 ) . This suggests the potential for diosgenin as a traditional Chinese medicine in clinical antitumor use . At present , the incidence rate of some kinds of cancers in certain areas is increasing , such as colorectal cancer in Latin America , Asia , Eastern Europe , breast cancer in low‑income countries , gastric cardia cancer in the United States and many European countries ( 119‑121 ) , besides , cancer remains a serious threat to human health and mortality ( 1 ) . Cancer is often discovered in the late stages , and in the majority of cases , the primary cancer has metastasized into adjacent lymph nodes and other sites ( 3 ) . Diosgenin , as a main component of a tradi‑ tional Chinese medicine , has a suppressing effect on tumor metastasis . Numerous anticancer drugs that are currently used have toxic side effects , and certain types of cancer develop resistance to the drugs to a certain extent ( 30 ) . Diosgenin may have the capability of avoiding these shortcomings ( 30 , 110 ) . The clinical use of diosgenin as an anticancer treatment requires further study and testing . Given the multiple path‑ ways and various targets of diosgenin , future research should investigate its potential function in cancer inhibition . 8 . Conclusions and prospects Diosgenin may act on : i ) Src by inhibiting its phosphorylation ii ) the FAK pathway by inhibiting the expression of associ‑ ated molecules and activation of the pathway ; and iii ) NF‑ κ B by inhibiting its level and activity , in addition to other path‑ ways . Furthermore , Src , the FAK pathway and NF‑ κ B have inter‑relationships . The inhibition of diosgenin on Src , the FAK pathway and NF‑ κ B has a negative effect on the main switch Cortactin , thus inhibiting invadopodia formation in various cancer cells . Future studies should examine the mechanism of diosgenin inhibition of invadopodia formation to suppress the metastasis of primary tumors . These findings will aid subsequent clinical applications , particularly pharmaceutical use . Acknowledgements Not applicable .
