Korn , National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD , and approved July 26 , 2005 ( received for review May 5 , 2005 ) The structural and mechanical properties of monomeric actin ( G - actin ) , the trimer nucleus , and actin ﬁlaments ( F - actins ) are deter - mined as a function of the conformation of the DNase I - binding loop ( DB loop ) by using all - atom molecular dynamics simulations and coarse - grained ( CG ) analysis . Recent x - ray structures of ADP - bound G - actin ( G - ADP ) by Otterbein et al . [ Otterbein , L . R . , Graceffa , P . & Dominguez , R . ( 2001 ) Science 293 , 708 – 711 ] and ATP - bound G - actin ( G - ATP ) by Graceffa and Dominguez [ Graceffa , P . & Dominguez , R . ( 2003 ) J . Biol . Chem . 278 , 34172 – 34180 ] indicate that the DB loop of actin does not have a well deﬁned secondary structure in the ATP state but folds into an (cid:1) - helix in the ADP state . MD simulations and CG analysis indicate that such a helical DB loop signiﬁcantly weakens the intermonomer interactions of actin as - semblies and thus leads to a wider , shorter , and more disordered ﬁlament . The computed persistence lengths of F - actin composed of G - ATP ( 16 (cid:2) m ) and of G - ADP ( 8 . 5 (cid:2) m ) agree well with the experimental values for the two states . Therefore , the loop - to - helix transition of the DB loop may be one of the factors that lead to the changes in structural and mechanical properties of F - actin after ATP hydrolysis . This result may provide a direct connection between the conformational changes of an actin monomer and the structural and mechanical properties of the cytoskeleton . The information provided by MD simulations also helps to understand the possible origin of the special features of actin dynamics . persistence length (cid:1) loop - to - helix transition (cid:1) ATP hydrolysis I n addition to conferring the mechanical properties of muscle cells , actin and its filaments are the major components of the cytoskeleton in eukaryotic cells ( 1 ) . Regulation of the polymer - ization (cid:2) depolymerization of F - actin ( actin filament ) is thus essential for cytokinesis , cell mobility , and the control of cell shape and polarity . G - actin ( monomeric actin ) bound with ATP assembles into filaments under physiological salt concentrations . The ATPase activity of actin increases after polymerization , and a driving force that regulates the growth dynamics of F - actins is the hydrolysis of bound ATP into ADP ( 2 ) . The release of the inorganic phosphate is related to the destabilization of the filament and promotes its disassembly ( 3 , 4 ) . F - ADP [ F - actin that is composed of ADP - bound G - actin ( G - ADP ) ] has also been found to be more susceptible to actin - depolymerization proteins so that the growth dynamics can be further regulated ( 5 ) . A conformational change of actin is associated with the ATP hydrolysis ; electron microscopy , proteolysis , and fluorescence spectroscopy studies ( 6 – 11 ) have revealed that this conforma - tional change is directly linked to the DNase I - binding loop ( DB loop ) in subdomain 2 of actin . Recent x - ray structures of G - actin by Otterbein et al . ( 12 ) and Graceffa and Dominguez ( 13 ) show a loop - to - helix transition of the DB loop upon ATP hydrolysis . As shown in Fig . 1 , the DB loop folds into an (cid:1) - helix in the ADP state ( 12 ) but does not form a well defined secondary structure in the ATP state ( 13 ) . This finding is different from an earlier x - ray study by Holmes et al . ( 14 ) where the structures of G - ATP ( ATP - bound G - actin ) and G - ADP were found to be very similar and the DB loop adopted a loop conformation in both states . The Otterbein et al . ( 12 ) structure was obtained from the crystals of G - ADP in the absence of other proteins . In the Holmes et al . ( 14 ) structure , however , G - ADP was complexed with protein DNase I , and the structures were obtained after the hydrolysis of ATP within the crystals of G - ATP . Therefore , the conformation of G - ADP in the Holmes et al . ( 14 ) structure can be constrained in the ATP state by crystal contacts or by the interactions with DNase I ( 12 ) . In F - actin , the DB loop also plays critical roles in forming contacts with the neighboring actin ( 15 ) . Therefore , it is possible that the DB loop still maintains a loop conformation after ATP hydrolysis in a filament but does not turn into a helix as in the Otterbein et al . ( 12 ) structure for an extended period . It has been known that the structures and properties of F - actin are strong functions of the bound ligands ( ATP or ADP ) , types of ions in the solution , and preparation procedures . These differences can be observed directly under an electron micro - scope ( 3 , 4 , 6 ) . The critical roles of the DB loop in filament polymerization demonstrated by means of proteolytic experi - ments ( 4 , 7 ) thus imply that the structure of a filament should depend on the conformation of the DB loop . An important question , therefore , is whether a loop - to - helix transition of the DB loop is responsible for the differences of various F - actins or whether the opening (cid:2) closing of the ATP cleft in G - ATP is more relevant ( 4 , 13 ) . The coupling between the monomer confor - mation and the filament structure also complicates the construc - tion and refinement of accurate atomic models of F - actin . The current practice usually starts from an atomic structure of the actin monomer and uses this structure to reproduce the low - resolution image pattern , such as the x - ray fiber diffraction , by tuning the orientation among monomers ( 12 , 15 , 16 ) . Although the conformation of the monomer could be allowed to relax in an empirical fashion during the fitting process , the correspon - dence between monomer conformation and the filament struc - ture is not clear . That is , there is a question of whether a loop or helical conformation of the DB loop should be used in the structural determination of a particular type of F - actin . These issues can be addressed by directly observing how a loop - to - helix transition of the DB loop would lead to changes in the structures and properties of F - actin . It is also difficult to resolve the detailed structure and flexi - bility of F - actin , mainly because of the limited resolution of the structural determination techniques such as electron microscopy or x - ray fiber diffraction ( 15 – 17 ) . Molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations , therefore , provide an alternative route to delineate the mechanism of how the ATP hydrolysis - induced conforma - tional change regulates the growth dynamics of F - actins . In this work , the influences of the DB loop conformation on the structural and mechanical properties of actin and F - actins This paper was submitted directly ( Track II ) to the PNAS ofﬁce .

Three sizes of actin assemblies are studied : monomer , trimer , and filament . Simu - lations of G - actin are used to develop the relationship between the actin conformation and the characteristics of its flexibility . Actin trimers are , in turn , the nucleus of polymerization at the initial stage of filament growth . MD simulations and coarse - grained ( CG ) analysis of trimers can establish the connection between monomer conformation and the growth rates of fila - ments . Trimer simulations can also shed light on the molecular origin of the directionality of filament growth ( i . e . , faster growth and dissociation rates at the (cid:1) end ) ( 2 , 18 ) . In the simulations of an F - actin , thirteen monomers are included in the simulation cell , and periodicity along the longi - tudinal direction is assumed , along with the other two directions , corresponding to a forced crossover every six turns ( 15 ) . By then designing a suitable CG representation , the persistence length of F - actin as a function of the DB loop conformation can be determined , providing a possible direct linkage between the conformation of a structural protein and elastic properties of the cytoskeleton . Because conformational changes of proteins in - duced by modifying the bound ligand such as ATP are ubiquitous in the regulation of cellular processes , the results of this study are also important in developing an understanding of these phe - nomena . Methods Computational methods are briefly summarized here ; a detailed version is provided in Supporting Text , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS website . Systems . To examine the ATP hydrolysis - induced conforma - tional change in the DB loop , separate simulations were per - formed for actin assemblies composed of G - ATP or G - ADP . Initial structures of G - ADP and G - ATP were taken from Otterbein et al . ( 12 ) ( Protein Data Bank ID code 1J6Z ) and Graceffa and Dominguez ( 13 ) ( PDB ID code 1NWK ) , respec - tively ( see Fig . 1 ) . The filament model by Holmes et al . ( 15 ) was used to determine the initial organization among monomers for trimers and the filament . All actin systems were solvated by using the TIP3P model of explicit water ( 19 ) with at least four solvation shells from the protein molecules to each side of the periodic boundary . Potassium chloride ( KCl ) was used to neutralize the actin systems , and the number of counter ions was adjusted according to its physiological concentration . The CHARMM pro - gram ( 20 ) was used to construct the actin systems , and the SOLVATE program ( 21 ) was used to determine the initial posi - tions of counter ions . VMD software ( 22 ) was used for visualiza - tion and for generating the plots of actin . The final system sizes are 64 , 899 ( G - ATP ) and 64 , 893 ( G - ADP ) atoms for monomers , 171 , 298 ( G - ATP - T ) and 171 , 287 ( G - ADP - T ) atoms for trimers , and 575 , 901 [ F - ATP ( F - actin that is composed of G - ATP ) ] and 575 , 888 ( F - ADP ) atoms for F - actins . A detailed decomposition of each system is listed in Table 1 , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site . To our knowl - edge , the system size of F - actin is by far the largest simulation study of cytoskeleton that has ever been conducted . MD Simulations . The CHARMM22 force field ( 23 ) was used in the simulations of actin assemblies . Periodic boundary condi - tions were applied , and the long - range electrostatic interactions were computed by the particle mesh Ewald algorithm ( 24 ) . All bonds associated with the hydrogen atom were constrained by the SHAKE algorithm ( 25 ) , thus allowing an integration time step of 2 fs . The system was first heated to 310 K by means of velocity assigning followed by a 40 - ps preequilibration by veloc - ity scaling . Simulations were then continued in the constant NPT ensemble ( 310 K and 1 atm ) , and the exact lengths of trajectories are mentioned in Results . All MD simulations were performed by using the NAMD simulation package ( 26 ) , and the CHARMM program ( 20 ) was used to analyze the results . CG Representations of Actin Assemblies and the Calculations of Persistence Length . F - actin is composed of G - actin and contains two strands of right - handed helices ( 15 ) . CG models of different resolutions can be designed for the actin systems . For instance , each monomer can represent one CG particle to discretize the two strands of right - handed helices . The two strands can be further CG into a linear polymer as detailed in Supporting Text . The trajectories of this discretized linear polymer were then computed from the all - atom MD trajectories . By applying meso - scopic theories of linear polymers ( 27 – 29 ) , persistence lengths of F - actin can be determined directly from MD simulations . Details of the coarse - graining procedures and the procedures of calcu - lating the persistence lengths can be found in Supporting Text . A second CG model was also used in this work to elucidate the characteristics of actin flexibility and the intermonomer inter - actions in the assemblies . An actin monomer was CG into four particles ( see Fig . 1 ) ; each CG particle corresponds to a subdo - main of G - actin according to the definitions in Holmes et al . ( 14 ) . Each CG actin monomer has three bonds , two angles , and one dihedral angle . Effective CG harmonic potentials were used to describe these coordinates , except for the dihedral angle , where a cosine potential of multiplicity one was used ( 20 , 23 ) . The equilibrium geometries of the CG model were determined by the ensemble averages of the all - atom MD simulations . Because the thermal fluctuations of internal coordinates can be deter - mined by diagonalizing the Hessian of the total potential energy ( 30 ) , the force constants of the CG potentials can thus be determined by matching the computed fluctuations at 310 K to those of all - atom MD simulations . For actin trimers and fila - ments , the intermonomer interactions between CG actin were represented as effective harmonic bonds , and the associated force fields were determined in the same manner .

Note that this approach of fluctuation matching is not limited to a harmonic form of the potentials but can also be applied to arbitrary types of energy functions such as effective Lennard – Jones or Coulombic inter - actions . Results G - Actin . The x - ray structures of G - ATP ( 13 ) and G - ADP ( 12 ) are both stable in an aqueous environment ; their rms deviations of C (cid:1) from the x - ray structures are 1 . 7 (cid:2) 0 . 03 and 1 . 9 (cid:2) 0 . 06 Å , respectively . The above statistics and those reported later are averaged over the last 10 ns of the trajectories of G - ATP ( 25 . 7 - ns total duration ) and G - ADP ( 27 . 9 - ns total duration ) . Because the DB loop , residues 40 – 48 , adopts a loop conformation in G - ATP ( 13 ) but forms a short helix in G - ADP ( 12 ) , the C (cid:1) s in the DB loop of G - ATP have a larger average rms fluctuation ( 2 . 14 (cid:2) 0 . 14 Å ) than that of G - ADP ( 0 . 34 (cid:2) 0 . 06 Å ) . The conformation of the DB loop also affects the slow modes of motion in an actin monomer , and the CG procedures pre - sented earlier can quantify these effects . The CG model is defined schematically in Fig . 1 , and the average geometries and force constants are reported in Table 2 , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site . X - ray studies ( 12 , 14 ) of G - actin have a 5° difference between G - ATP and G - ADP ( 12 , 13 ) in the angle of the propeller rotation , the d1 angle , and such a difference is also captured in the MD simulations ( see Table 2 ) . In contrast , the angular degrees of freedom , a1 ( (cid:1) D1 - D3 - D4 ) ( in which D n represents the n th subdomain of G - actin ) and a2 ( (cid:1) D2 - D1 - D3 ) , of G - ATP and G - ADP are very close , even though the conformation of the DB loop is different . Because a1 and a2 correspond to the open (cid:2) close motion of the ATP cleft , this result indicates that G - actin remains a closed cleft in both the ATP and ADP states in an aqueous environment . Although the geometries of a1 and a2 are similar , the higher flexibility of the DB loop in G - ATP results in softer angular potentials . For instance , the a2 angle of G - ATP has an effective force constant half that of G - ADP in Table 2 . On the contrary , the propeller rotation of the d1 dihedral angle in G - ATP has a force constant two times stiffer than that of G - ADP . The above results show that the loop - to - helix transition of the DB loop after ATP hydrolysis softens the propeller rotation but hardens the open (cid:2) close mode of the ATP cleft in an actin monomer . The propeller rotation and the open (cid:2) close of the ATP cleft are particularly important because they have been proposed to be closely related to the regulation of F - actin growth by means of ATP hydrolysis ( 17 , 31 ) . The flexibilities of these modes seem to be more sensitive than the geometries . Therefore , protein flex - ibility appears to be an important factor in the regulation of filament growth by means of ATP hydrolysis . Actin Trimers . An actin trimer has been shown to be a stable nucleus of filament growth ( 18 ) , and it is also the smallest cluster that contains the basic interactions in a filament . Formation of the trimer is thus the rate - liming step of filament growth , and G - ATP grows much faster than G - ADP ( 2 ) . Therefore , MD simulations of the nucleus of G - ATP ( G - ATP - T ) and of G - ADP ( G - ADP - T ) can shed light on how ATP hydrolysis and phos - phate release affects the growth of F - actin . It is known that the growth and dissociation of F - actin at the (cid:1) end is 8 – 9 times faster that that at the (cid:3) end ( 2 ) , and the results of MD simulations are also helpful in understanding this phenomenon . To sample the configuration of actin trimers more efficiently , three independent trajectories were spawned from the initial configurations of G - ATP - T and G - ADP - T with different initial velocities . The six trajectories are then continued for 16 – 18 ns . The results presented below are based on the averages over the last 5 ns of these trajectories . A representative snapshot of G - ATP - T is shown in Fig . 2 , as well as the CG model of the actin trimer . The monomers are numbered 1 - 3 starting at the (cid:1) end and hereafter will be referred to by italic numbers . 1 and 3 belong to one of the two strands in an F - actin , and 2 is the starting monomer of the other . Some of the key interactions that hold together the nucleus are high - lighted in Fig . 2 . Between two monomers across a strand , the plug - in loop ( residues 264 – 271 , yellow ) of 2 D3 ( D3 in monomer 2 ) forms contacts with the DB loop ( residues 40 – 48 , white ) of 3 D2 at the (cid:3) end , and the plug - in loop of 1 D3 forms contacts with residues 283 – 289 in 2 D3 ( cyan ) at the (cid:1) end . In addition , a short turn composed of residues 62 – 64 ( purple ) in D2 also interacts with the plug - in loop . With other cross - strand contacts between D4 and D1 and between D4 and D3 , five bonds between two monomers across the strand are assigned in the CG model in Fig . 2 . Along the strand between 1 and 3 , the contacts between the DB loop of 1 and residues 372 – 375 ( orange ) of 3 , a D2 – D1 interaction , are marked in Fig . 2 . Other interactions along a strand are between D2 and D3 and between D4 and D3 , and thus three effective bonds between 1 and 3 are assigned in the CG model . These bonds are defined in the legend of Fig . 2 and are denoted as i D m – j D n , where i and j are monomer identities and m and n designate subdomains 1 – 4 . In G - ATP - T , the major interactions between monomers are hydrophobic contacts ( 32 ) ; † only a few intermonomer hydrogen bonds ( HBs ) , are identified . ‡ On average , three to four HBs between 1 and 2 and between 2 and 3 exist across a strand . The cross - strand HBs include Arg - 39 and Arg - 62 in D2 with the acidic residues in the plug - in loop and Thr - 203 in D4 with Glu - 270 in D3 .

A total of ﬁve effective bonds are assigned in the CG model for two monomers across a strand : i D2 – ( i (cid:1) 1 ) D3 , i D2 – ( i (cid:1) 1 ) D4 , i D4 – ( i (cid:1) 1 ) D1 , i D4 – ( i (cid:1) 1 ) D3 , and i D3 – ( i (cid:1) 1 ) D3 . Italic number indicates the number identity of a monomer , and D1 – D4 denote the subdo - mains . In the cases of the trimer nucleus , i (cid:5) 1 or 2 . For two monomers along the same strand , a total of three effective bonds are assigned in the CG actin trimers : i D2 – ( i (cid:1) 2 ) D1 , i D2 – ( i (cid:1) 2 ) D3 , and i D4 – ( i (cid:1) 2 ) D3 . Othereffectivebonds between monomers follow the same convention of nomenclature . Chu and Voth PNAS (cid:1) September 13 , 2005 (cid:1) vol . 102 (cid:1) no . 37 (cid:1) 13113 B I O P H Y S I C S only one HB per frame is identified on average . This 1 (cid:2) 3 HB is between Asp - 244 in D4 and basic residues Arg - 290 or Lys - 291 in D3 . The overall effects of these interactions can be quantified by the force constants of intermonomer bonds in the CG model ; the results are reported in Table 3 , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site . The results of intramonomer degrees of freedom are reported in Table 4 , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site . Comparing the force constants of cross - strand bonds ( i . e . , bonds between 1 and 2 and between 2 and 3 of G - ATP - T ) , it can be seen from Table 3 that the 2 (cid:2) 3 bonds are stronger . This trend can be explained by the difference in molecular interactions at the (cid:1) and (cid:3) ends of the nucleus . First of all , the 2 - DB loop ( the DB loop of monomer 2 ) interacts with the 3 - plug - in loop ( the plug - in loop of monomer 3 ) as shown in Fig . 2 . The same interaction between monomers 1 and 2 , however , is not as strong because the 1 - DB loop also forms contacts with 3 - [ residues 372 – 375 ] ( residues 372 – 375 in 3 ) . Therefore , the 1 (cid:2) 3 interaction of the DB loop along a strand weakens its 1 (cid:2) 2 interaction across the strand . The result is that the 1 D2 - 2 D3 force constant is only 1 (cid:2) 6 . 5 times that of 2 D2 - 3 D3 . Although there exists an additional plug - in loop (cid:2) residues 283 – 286 contact between 1 D3 and 2 D3 at the (cid:1) end , this interaction is not enough to compensate the weaker 1 D2 - 2 D3 contacts , probably because the DB loop is more flexible than the pocket of residues 283 – 286 so that the plug - in loop (cid:2) DB loop interaction is stronger than that between the plug - in loop and residues 283 – 286 . These differences in inter - actions lead to the stronger 2 (cid:2) 3 bonds and , most likely , are the molecular origin of the faster dissociation rates , or the growth rates , at the (cid:1) end . Because growth (cid:2) dissociation at the (cid:1) end corresponds to the formation (cid:2) breaking of 1 (cid:2) 2 and 1 (cid:2) 3 bonds , whereas growth (cid:2) dissociation at the (cid:3) end corresponds to the formation (cid:2) breaking of 2 (cid:2) 3 and 1 (cid:2) 3 bonds , the above results show that the 2 (cid:2) 3 bonds are stronger than the 1 (cid:2) 3 bonds . The simulations of G - ATP - T indicate that the DB loop plays critical roles in stabilizing the trimer nucleus . The DB loop can interact with residues 372 – 375 of a neighboring monomer along a strand ( 1 (cid:2) 3 ) and with the plug - in loop of the neighbor across the strand ( 1 (cid:2) 2 and 2 (cid:2) 3 ) . Therefore , a loop - to - helix transition of the DB loop after ATP hydrolysis is expected to significantly change the properties of the nucleus . A representative snapshot of G - ADP - T is shown in Fig . 2 , and significant differences to the structure of G - ATP - T are ob - served . First of all , the helical DB loop has less contact with the neighboring monomer across the strand by means of the inter - actions between the DB loop and the plug - in loops . It can be seen from Fig . 2 that the 2 - DB loop and 3 - plug - in loop separate farther in G - ADP - T , as indicated by the arrow between 2 and 3 in Fig . 2 b . The decay of the DB loop (cid:2) plug - in loop interaction between 2 and 3 in G - ADP - T is reflected in Table 3 in that the 2 D2 - 3 D4 bond of G - ADP - T is 3 . 3 Å longer and 40 % weaker than that of G - ATP - T . Another consequence of the loop - to - helix transition of the DB loop is the loss of the DB loop (cid:2) residues 372 – 375 interactions between 1 and 3 along the strand in G - ADP - T . In Fig . 2 , the 1 - DB loop closely interacts with 3 - [ residues 372 – 375 ] in G - ATP - T but not in G - ADP - T . Instead , the 1 - DB loop in G - ADP - T shifts closer to the 2 - plug - in loop ( see the arrows in Fig . 2 b between 1 and 3 ) . As a result , the 1 D2 - 3 D1 effective bond in G - ADP - T is 10 Å longer and five times weaker than that in G - ATP - T , as Table 3 shows . The 1 D2 - 2 D3 effective bond , however , is 3 Å shorter and two times stronger in G - ADP - T due to the shift of the 1 - DB loop toward the 2 - plug - in loop after the break of the 1 (cid:2) 3 interaction . This shift also leads to the break of the plug - in loop (cid:2) residues 283 – 286 interaction between 1 and 2 , the D3 – D3 interaction ( see the arrow between 1 and 3 in Fig . 2 b ) . The 1 D3 - 2 D3 bond thus becomes 3 . 4 Å longer and two times weaker in G - ADP - T , as shown in Table 3 . Note that the hydrogen - bonding patterns and strengths be - tween monomers are the same in both G - ADP - T and G - ATP - T . Therefore , actin does not appear to use HBs to control the growth of F - actin . Instead , the loop - to - helix transition of the DB loop due to ATP hydrolysis significantly alters the contacts among monomers and therefore the stability of the nucleus . The flexible and extended DB loop in G - ATP forms extensive contacts with the neighboring monomers both along and across a strand . The helical form of the DB loop after ATP hydrolysis , however , weakens the contacts across the strand and prevents the contacts along the strand , thereby destabilizing the nucleus . These consequences resulting from the loop - to - helix transition of the DB loop are also likely the molecular basis for the faster growth rates of G - ATP into filaments than that of G - ADP . F - Actin . F - actin systems include 13 monomers consisting of G - ATP ( DB loop in the loop form ) or G - ADP ( DB loop in the helical form ) in the periodic simulation cell and are fully solvated with explicit water . The Holmes et al . ( 15 ) filament model was used to construct the initial structures of F - ATP and F - ADP . Three independent trajectories with a length of 8 ns were generated for both F - ATP and F - ADP . The trends mentioned later of the structural relaxation of F - ATP and F - ADP reap - peared in the three trajectories . One of the three trajectories was then continued further , and a total of 40 ns were generated for both F - ATP and F - ADP . The properties of F - ATP and F - ADP were computed based on the last 10 ns of each trajectory . F - ATP and F - ADP were found to evolve to very different structures . A representative snapshot of F - ATP and F - ADP , as well as the initial structure from the Holmes model , are shown in Fig . 3 . F - ATP remains intact throughout the simulation . The lengths of the simulation cell along the longitudinal direction as a function of time are shown in Fig . 5 , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site . The repeat of F - ATP plateaued at (cid:6) 366 Å after 30 ns . A repeat of 366 (cid:2) 0 . 2 Å of F - ATP in the simulation was (cid:6) 6 Å longer than that in the Holmes model of F - actin . Because ATP in F - ATP was not hydrolyzed in the MD simulations , our results correspond to the properties of a filament composed entirely of G - ATP . Moreover , only 13 monomers were included in the simulation of F - actin , and the resulting long wavelength undulations that are not included may also cause an overestimation of the repeat length . F - ADP , in contrast , developed prominent defects and bends during the simulation , as shown in Fig . 3 . The repeat of F - ADP , as Fig . 5 shows , has an average of 356 (cid:2) 0 . 3 Å . There exists a significant difference of 11 Å between the repeat of F - ATP and F - ADP . The molecular origin of the instability of F - ADP due to the DB loop’s helical structure is demonstrated in Fig . 3 b . Similar to the case of actin trimers , the less extensive helical form of the DB loop hinders its binding to residues 372 – 375 of the neighboring monomer along the same strand in a filament , as indicated by the white straight arrow in Fig . 3 b . Instead , residues at the beginning of the DB loop tend to form contacts with the plug - in loop across a strand ( see the green arrow in Fig . 3 b ) , as discussed in Results for the trimer nucleus . Such a tendency causes a rotation of G - ADP in the filament , as indicated by the curved arrows in Fig . 3 b . This rotation of the actin monomer induces bends in the filament . The maximum angle of bending ( i . e . , the angle between a tangent vector along the polymer to a chosen reference ) of F - ADP is 32 . 4 (cid:2) 0 . 05° , and the value is 19 . 6 (cid:2) 0 . 25° for F - ATP . This rotation of G - ADP to form a cross - strand DB loop (cid:2) plug - in loop contact further destabilizes the filament by breaking the plug - in loop (cid:2) residues 284 – 287 interactions , the D3 – D3 contact , across the strand ( see the dashed arrow in Fig . 3 b ) . The loss of the D3 – D3 contact across the two strands results in a 2 . 4 (cid:2) 0 . 06 - Å increase in the diameter of F - ADP compared with that of F - ATP . The consequence of the loop - to - helix transition in the 13114 (cid:1) www . pnas . org (cid:2) cgi (cid:2) doi (cid:2) 10 . 1073 (cid:2) pnas . 0503732102 Chu and Voth DB loop of actin monomers is that F - ADP becomes wider , shorter , and more disordered than F - ATP . These trends are also similar to the electron microscope images of F - actin polymerized from G - ATP or G - ADP ( 4 , 6 ) . The wider diameter of F - ADP could also explain why the nucleotide binding cleft in F - ADP is more apparent under an electron microscope . The ATP cleft of the monomers maintains a closed state in both F - ATP and F - ADP . The average a2 angles are 92 . 2 (cid:2) 2 . 7° in F - ATP and 94 . 9 (cid:2) 3 . 2°in F - ADP . These results suggest that a loop - to - helix transition of the DB loop alone can destabilize the filament without opening the nucleotide - binding cleft . In addition to structural properties , mechanical properties such as the persistence length of F - actin can also be computed from the MD trajectories . By means of the procedures de - scribed in Supporting Text , the cosine of the angle between tangent vectors along the contour length of F - ATP and F - ADP were computed and are shown in Fig . 4 . The persistence lengths of F - ATP and F - ADP are estimated from the initial slope of the decay of the logarithm of the cosine function as a function of the contour length , s . The estimated persistence length of F - ATP is 15 . 8 – 16 . 5 (cid:2) m , agreeing well with the experimentally measured value of 13 . 5 (cid:2) m for a F - ADP - BeF 3 (cid:3) filament that mimics F - ATP ( 33 ) . For F - ADP , the computed persistence length is 8 . 4 – 8 . 7 (cid:2) m , also agreeing well with the measured value , 9 (cid:2) m ( 33 ) . The above results show that the conformation of the DB loop modulates the filament structure and , consequently , the persis - tence length of the polymer . A loop structure of the DB loop in F - ATP forms extensive contacts in a filament and leads to a strong bending rigidity . However , a helical structure of the DB loop breaks some of these interactions and results in a shorter persistence length of F - ADP . The correspondence between the computed persistence lengths and the measured values indicates that the weaker elasticity of F - ADP can be attributed to the conformational change of the DB loop . Each monomer in F - actin was also CG into four subdomains as performed in the cases of monomers and trimers , and the effective force constants of the CG internal coordinates were obtained by using the same procedures . The intramolecular coordinates are the same as those defined in Fig . 1 , and intermonomer interactions are described as effective harmonic bonds . In coarse - graining the filament , it was found that the existence of self - consistent solutions for the force constants depend on the number of intermonomer bonds included in the CG model . If too few are included , the fluctuation of some of the included degrees of freedom cannot be reproduced . If too many intermonomer bonds are included , a force constant of zero will result for the redundant degrees of freedom . Therefore , with an arbitrary selection of intermonomer connections and force constants , a CG model cannot represent the corresponding behavior of all - atom MD simulations . In addition to the eight types of intermonomer bonds shown in Fig . 2 that are based on the interactions between the subdomains , effective bonds for i D1 – ( i (cid:1) 2 ) D1 , i D2 – ( i (cid:1) 2 ) D2 , and i D4 – ( i (cid:1) 2 ) D4 need to be included for a self - consistent solution of the force constants . These additional bonds provide angular restrictions between actin monomers along a strand [ i . e . , for the i D2 – ( i (cid:1) 2 ) D1 , i D2 – ( i (cid:1) 2 ) D3 , and i D4 – ( i (cid:1) 2 ) D3 bonds defined in Fig . 2 ] , so that the integrity of F - actin can be described in a CG model with fewer degrees of freedom . The CG parameters of F - ATP and F - ADP are presented in Table 5 , which is published as support - ing information on the PNAS web site . From the data , the dependence of intermonomer interactions on DB loop confor - mation ( see earlier discussions and Fig . 3 ) can be related to the geometries and the force constants of F - ATP and F - ADP . For example , the i D2 – ( i (cid:1) 2 ) D3 and i D2 – ( i (cid:1) 2 ) D4 effective CG bonds of F - ADP are significantly weaker than those of F - ATP because of the reduced contacts associated with its less extensive DB loop . The i D3 – ( i (cid:1) 1 ) D3 CG bond of F - ADP is also significantly weaker due to the loss of plug - in loop (cid:2) residues 283 – 286 interaction discussed earlier . Comparing the angular potentials of F - actin in Table 5 and those of the actin monomer in Table 2 , it can be seen that the a2 angle ( 208 D2 - D1 - D3 ) of F - ATP becomes two to three times stiffer than that of G - ATP , because the DB loop in D2 is responsible for the contacts between monomers across a strand in F - ATP , and thus the fluctuation of the a2 angle is reduced . The stiffening of this angular mode is related to the higher Fig . 3 . The conformation of F - ATP and F - ADP .

Note also from Table 5 that the propeller rotation angles , d1 , of monomers in F - ATP do not significantly differ from those of G - ATP . For F - ADP , however , the d1 angle becomes approxi - mately three times stiffer than that of the monomer , although the average values are equivalent . This result is due to the afore - mentioned tendency that the DB loop in D2 of F - ADP forms a contact with the plug - in loop across the strand because of the decrease of the along - strand interactions . The fluctuation of the propeller rotation is thus reduced . For the angular degrees of freedom in F - ADP , however , they have similar geometries and magnitudes of fluctuations as in the case of the monomer , which is opposite the behavior of F - ATP . Therefore , intramonomer modes such as opening (cid:2) closing of the ATP cleft and propeller rotation are also strong functions of the DB loop conformation and the resulting intermonomer interactions in the filament . Discussion In this study , MD simulations and CG analysis have shown that the conformation of the DB loop has dramatic effects on the structural and mechanical properties of F - actin . When the DB loop is in a loop conformation in the ATP state , the contacts that are observed in x - ray fiber diagrams among monomers are maintained in the MD simulations . When the DB loop adopts a helical structure , intermonomer contacts are seriously affected , thus resulting in a wider , shorter , and more disordered filament in the ADP state . The computed persistence lengths agree well with the measured values at the two states , and a direct con - nection is thus established between the monomer conformations and the structural and mechanical properties of the F - actin . The observed structural differences between F - ATP and F - ADP are also similar to those in the electron microscope images of F - actin polymerized from G - ATP and G - ADP ( 3 , 4 , 6 ) . Because ATP is hydrolyzed in F - actin , the DB loop is not in the form of an (cid:1) - helix but in the form of an unstructured loop in a ‘‘young’’ filament . Based on the MD results , such a loop conformation of the DB loop is stabilized by the contacts with neighboring monomers . It is thus concluded that , after ATP hydrolysis and the release of phosphate , the loop - like confor - mation of the DB loop should persist for an extended period . Therefore , in the development of atomic models of F - actins , G - actin structures with a loop - like conformation of the DB loop ( 13 , 15 ) should be used for a young filament , and G - ADP with a helical DB loop should be used for an aged filament . The persistence length of F - actin is also a function of the DB loop conformation as described earlier . The significant weak - ening effects of a helical DB loop imply that when the loop - to - helix transition of the DB loop occurs , fragmentation of the filament may occur . Indeed , initial signs of fragmentation have been observed in the simulations of F - ADP ( see also Fig . 3 ) . Fragmentation and annealing reactions have been found to be necessary for a phenomenological model to predict an accurate length for F - actins ( 18 ) . Fragmentation has also been suggested to have a slow intrinsic rate , but the net rate depends on the length of the filament ( 18 ) . A loop - to - helix transition of the DB loop in a filament is expected to be slow because the loop conformation is stabilized by filament contacts . However , as the length of the filament increases , the chance for such a transition also increases . Therefore , one role of the loop - to - helix transition of the DB loop can be to induce fragmentation to regulate the average length of F - actins . In addition to the effects of the DB loop on filament prop - erties , molecular - level understanding of the directionality of filament growth and the increased ATPase activity of F - actin were also explored in this work by MD simulations and CG analysis . Because another component of the cytoskeleton , mi - crotubules , have many features similar to F - actins , knowledge of F - actin - associated phenomena may also be helpful in under - standing the behavior of microtubules .
