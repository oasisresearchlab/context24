Open Access Molecular Brain Contraction of human brain vascular pericytes in response to islet amyloid polypeptide is reversed by pramlintide Cristina Nuñez‑Diaz 1 , Dovilė Pocevičiūtė 1 , Nina Schultz 1 , The Netherlands Brain Bank 2 , Charlotte Welinder 3 , Karl Swärd 4 and Malin Wennström 1 * Abstract The islet amyloid polypeptide ( IAPP ) , a pancreas‑produced peptide , has beneficial functions in its monomeric form . However , IAPP aggregates , related to type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) , are toxic not only for the pancreas , but also for the brain . In the latter , IAPP is often found in vessels , where it is highly toxic for pericytes , mural cells that have contractile properties and regulate capillary blood flow . In the current study , we use a microvasculature model , where human brain vascular pericytes ( HBVP ) are co‑cultured together with human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells , to demonstrate that IAPP oligomers ( oIAPP ) alter the morphology and contractility of HBVP . Contraction and relaxa‑ tion of HBVP was verified using the vasoconstrictor sphingosine‑1‑phosphate ( S1P ) and vasodilator Y27632 , where the former increased , and the latter decreased , the number of HBVP with round morphology . Increased number of round HBVP was also seen after oIAPP stimulation , and the effect was reverted by the IAPP analogue pramlintide , Y27632 , and the myosin inhibitor blebbistatin . Inhibition of the IAPP receptor with the antagonist AC187 only reverted IAPP effects partially . Finally , we demonstrate by immunostaining of human brain tissue against laminin that individuals with high amount of brain IAPP levels show significantly lower capillary diameter and altered mural cell morphology compared to individuals with low brain IAPP levels . These results indicate that HBVP , in an in vitro model of microvas‑ culature , respond morphologically to vasoconstrictors , dilators , and myosin inhibitors . They also suggest that oIAPP induces contraction of these mural cells and that pramlintide can reverse such contraction . Keywords Amylin , Vasculopathy , Mural cells , Diabetes , Blood flow Introduction The islet amyloid polypeptide ( IAPP ) , also known as amylin , is a 37 aa polypeptide expressed by pancre - atic islet β - cells , where it is postprandially co - secreted with insulin . In its monomeric form , IAPP physiological functions include delaying gastric emptying , promoting satiation , and reducing postprandial glucagon secretion [ 1 ] . However , oligomeric and fibrillar forms of IAPP are related with pathological conditions , such as type 2 dia - betes mellitus ( T2DM ) . This disease is characterized by the accumulation of IAPP aggregates in the pancreas [ 2 – 4 ] . Besides , the polypeptide has been linked with Alzhei - mer’s disease ( AD ) , since IAPP deposits have been found * Correspondence : Malin Wennström malin . wennstrom @ med . lu . se 1 Cognitive Disorder Research Unit , Department of Clinical Sciences Malmö , Lund University , Malmö , Sweden 2 Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience , Meibergdreef 47 , 1105 BA Amsterdam , The Netherlands 3 Faculty of Medicine , Department of Clinical Sciences , Lund , Mass Spectrometry , Lund University , Lund , Sweden 4 Department of Experimental Medical Science , Lund University , Lund , Sweden Page 2 of 11 Nuñez‑Diaz et al . Molecular Brain ( 2023 ) 16 : 25 in the brains of AD patients , regardless of T2DM diag - nosis . The pancreatic IAPP is known to cross the blood brain barrier ( BBB ) [ 5 , 6 ] and under normal conditions bind to amylin receptor in specific brain regions and thereby regulate appetite [ 1 ] . However , in AD patients the peptide is found as deposits in the parenchyma , ves - sel walls , and perivascular space , often co - localizing with amyloid beta ( Aβ ) [ 7 , 8 ] , which is one of the main pathological hallmarks of AD . This is interesting given that the risk of AD in T2DM patients is strongly linked to vascular complications ( e . g . , microvascular disease , diabetic foot , cerebrovascular disease , cardiovascular disease ) associated with the disease [ 9 ] . The significance of vessel - associated IAPP depositions in the brain is not known , but a previous study has shown that IAPP accu - mulation in brain vessel leads to loss of thight junctions and decreased endothelial cell coverage in rats [ 10 ] . In addition , we have demonstrated that oligomeric IAPP ( oIAPP ) , but also IAPP fibrils ( although to a lesser extent compared to oIAPP ) , are highly toxic to cultured primary human brain vascular pericytes ( HBVP ) [ 11 ] . Pericytes are mural cells which enclose the capillaries in the brain and form , together with endothelial cells and astrocytes , the BBB . Pericytes are therefore implicated in BBB per - meability , regulation and clearance of debris and toxic substances ( e . g . , Aβ ) . Pericytes also play a crucial role in angiogenesis and leukocyte extravasation [ 12 ] , and regu - late capillary blood flow by relaxing and contracting their endothelial tube enwrapping projections [ 13 ] . It may thus be that IAPP , via its impact on pericytes , strongly affects Aβ clearance , BBB permeability , and contrac - tion . Indeed , studies have shown that monomeric IAPP and pramlintide ( its non - aggregative analog ) enhance Aβ clearance from the brain to the blood [ 14 ] , and an asso - ciation between BBB permeability and total IAPP lev - els in cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) has been reported [ 15 ] . Whether IAPP interferes with capillary contraction is less explored . Therefore , the purpose of this study is to use an in vitro brain microvasculature model to eluci - date whether human oIAPP affects the morphology and contractility of mural cells . We will also investigate the potential link between IAPP and capillary contraction by analyzing capillary diameters and alterations in mural cell morphology in the hippocampal region CA1 of individu - als with high and low amount of IAPP in hippocampus . Materials and methods Cells Human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells ( hCMEC / D3 , Millipore , # SCC066 ) and primary human brain vascular pericytes ( HBVP , ScienCell , # 1200 ) were grown in complete endothelial cell growth medium ( EGM - 2MV , Lonza , # CC - 3129 ) and complete pericyte cell culture medium ( PM , ScienCell , # 1201 ) , respectively . For monolayer culture , endothelial cells were grown in rat tail collagen I ( Gibco , # A1048301 ) coated 6 - well plates and HBVP were cultured in poly - L - lysine ( Scien - Cell # 0413 ) coated 6 - well plates , both in humidified air with 5 % CO 2 at 37 °C until 70 – 80 % confluent . Proteomics The HBVP were evaluated prior to experiment using pro - teomics . The HBVP were grown in poly - L - lysine ( Sci - enCell # 0413 ) coated 12 - well plates in 3 replicates and thereafter lysed in RIPA buffer ( Sigma Aldrich # R0278 ) . For proteomics , 100 µL was reduced with dithiotreitol and alkylated with iodoacetamide followed by protein precipitation with ice cold ethanol overnight at − 20 °C . The samples were centrifuged and the pellets were resus - pended in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate and protein concenteration were determined . Samples , 30 µg , were digested with trypsin overnight . The generated pep - tides were injected into liquid chromatography – tandem mass spectrometry ( LC – MS / MS ) . The generated MS / MS spectra were searched using Proteome Discoverer 2 . 5 ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) against UniProt Human ( UP000005640 ) . The precursor tolerance and fragment tolerance were set to 15 ppm and 0 . 05 Da , respectively . Trypsin was selected as enzyme , methionine oxidation and deamidation of aspargine and glutamine were treated as dynamic modification , and carbamidomethylation of cysteine as a fixed modification . The dataset showed that the HBVP expressed mural cell markers such as PDGFβ receptor and NG2 , but not PDGFα receptor nor Dcn . Proteins involved in the contractility machinery , includ - ing transgelin , myosin regulatory light chain 9 , tropomy - osin beta chain , calponin 1 , myosin 9 and myosin 10 were also found . Stimuli for cell culture IAPP oligomers were prepared based on a previ - ously published protocol [ 16 ] , which yields IAPP bands between 4 and 25 kDa on a western blot [ 11 ] . Briefly , lyo - philized synthetic human IAPP 1 - 37 ( AlexoTech AB # AI - 452 - 10 ) was solubilized in 10 mM NaOH ( pH 11 ) . For adjusting the pH to 7 , phosphate buffer was added to a final concentration of 100 µM . For oligomer formation , IAPP was incubated with agitation for 20 min at room temperature . Pramlintide acetate salt ( Pram ) ( Sigma Aldrich # SML2523 ) Y27632 ( Sigma Aldrich , # SCM075 ) , and AC187 ( Tocris , # 3419 ) were resuspended in bi - distilled H 2 O . Sphingosine 1 phosphate ( S1P ) ( Sigma Aldrich , # 73914 - 1MG ) was solubilized in NaOH 0 . 3 M to a stock concentration of 1 mM . Blebbistatin ( Blebb ) ( Tocris , # 1760 ) was resuspended in dimethyl sulfoxide to a concentration of 100 mM . Page 3 of 11 Nuñez‑Diaz et al . Molecular Brain ( 2023 ) 16 : 25 Matrigel model For the Matrigel model , glass bottom angiogen - esis µ - slides ( Ibidi # 81507 ) were coated with a layer of Matrigel basement membrane matrix ( 10 mg / mL ) ( Corning # 354234 ) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C for polymerization . The cells in monolayer culture were 70 – 80 % confluent , in passages 4 – 6 ( HBVP ) and 31 – 33 ( hCMEC / D3 ) , and with a doubling time of approximately 48 h . HBVP were labelled with CellTracker ™ Green CMFDA dye ( Invitrogen , # C7025 ) prior to trypsiniza - tion , following the manufacturer’s instructions . After - wards , hCMEC / D3 and HBVP were co - seeded on top of the Matrigel layer at a density of 200 , 000 and 100 , 000 cells / mL , respectively , using 50 µL of medium ( EGM - 2MV 10 % FBS ) per well . Three hours after seeding , when the cells have already formed capillary - like structures ( CLS ) , stimulation was performed with IAPP 10 µM , sphingosine 1 phosphate 0 . 1 µM , Y27632 1 µM ( alone or combined with IAPP ) , AC187 10 µM ( combined with IAPP ) , pramlintide 1 µM ( alone or combined with IAPP ) , blebbistatin 1 µM ( combined with IAPP ) , and the corre - sponding vehicle conditions . The model was stimulated with the different conditions for 12 h . After stimulation , the microvascular model was stained with trypan blue ( Bio - Rad , # 1450013 ) for cell death analysis . After 12 h of stimulation , two randomly chosen fields of view of each well were captured with an Olympus BX41 light micro - scope with the 10 × objective ( 6 replicates per condition , 2 fields per replicate ) . To avoid biases , only after the fields were selected in the bright field microscopy , the images of fluorescent pericytes were captured . The numbers of total HBVP and round HBVP per arm were quantified in the fluorescent images using ImageJ software , where a threshold was set for the detection of green labeled HBVP , as well as a circularity filter of 0 . 8 – 1 . 0 ( where 1 . 0 is a perfect circle ) . Individuals included in the study Human hippocampal samples were provided by the Netherlands Brain Bank ( NBB ) , where neuropathologi - cal assessment of Aβ , neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques were performed according to ABC staging [ 17 ] . NBB also evaluated Lewy bodies ( LB ) stage according to Braak et al . [ 18 ] . Sex , age , neuropathological assessment ( ABC , LB ) , IAPP levels , diagnosis of T2DM , postmortem delay , and cause of death of the individuals are shown in Table 1 . The individuals included in the study showed lit - tle or no Aβ deposition in hippocampus to avoid inter - ference of this peptide with vessel diameter . The levels of IAPP in the hippocampus of the individuals were meas - ured previously and described by Schultz et al . [ 19 ] . The individuals were divided in two groups based on the mean value ( 10 pg / mL ) of their total IAPP levels ( solu - ble and insoluble ) , ( n = 4 ) cases with IAPP levels below the mean value ( IAPP low ) ( 4 . 83 – 6 . 05 pg / mL ) and ( n = 4 ) cases with IAPP levels above the mean value ( IAPP high ) ( 13 . 63 – 15 . 93 pg / mL ) . In all cases , informed con - sent for using brain tissue and clinical data for research was obtained from the patients or their closest relatives in accordance with the International Declaration of Hel - sinki and the Code of Conduct for Brain Banking . The medical ethics committee of VU Amsterdam approved the tissue collection procedures and the Swedish Ethical Review Authority approved the study . All data were ana - lyzed anonymously . Immunostaining and vessel quantification The hippocampal tissue was fixed in 4 % paraformalde - hyde for 4 h and then cryoprotected in phosphate - buff - ered saline with 30 % sucrose until it sank . The tissue was sliced into sections of 40 µm thickness using a microtome ( Leica SM 2010R ) . The sections were stored free - floating in cryoprotectant antifreeze solution at − 20 °C . In order to analyze the diameter of brain vessels and mural cell Table 1 Clinical data of individuals included in the study 1 ABC Montine staging of Alzheimer’s disease .

Molecular Brain ( 2023 ) 16 : 25 morphology , the sections were stained against laminin α5 , expressed by multiple mural cell types and vascular cells , including pericytes and endothelial cells . First , the sections were incubated in quenching solution ( 3 % H 2 O 2 , 10 % methanol ) for 30 min , followed by Impress reagent kit blocking solution ( Vector Laboratories # MP - 7402 ) for 1 h at room temperature and then incubation with mouse anti - laminin ( clone 4C7 , Dako ) in blocking solution over - night at 4 °C . Afterwards , the sections were incubated in Ig Impress reagent kit secondary anti - mouse antibody ( Vector Laboratories # MP - 7402 ) at room temperature for 2 h , and then developed for 2 min in 0 . 25 mg / mL diamin - obenzidine and 0 . 012 % H 2 O 2 . The sections were mounted with DPX ( Sigma Aldrich , # 06522 ) and pictures of CA1 hippocampal region ( stratum lacunosum - moleculare ) were captured with an Olympus BX41 light microscope with 20 × objective ( two sections of each individual , 20 fields in total ) . The diameter of total laminin - enclosed capillaries and the diameter of laminin - enclosed capillar - ies near mural cells were measured by a blinded observer using ImageJ software . Differences in laminin - enclosed mural cell morphology were analyzed by measuring the height of the laminin - enclosed mural cell bodies ( dis - tance between the highest point of mural cells and the capillary ) found in the images using SenseCell software ( Olympus ) . More than 70 mural cells per individual were analyzed . Statistics Statistical analysis was performed using Prism soft - ware ( version 9 . 2 . 0 , GraphPad ) . For normal distribution assessment , Kolmogorov – Smirnov test was performed . Our data was normally distributed , therefore , we per - formed independent - samples t - test or one - way ANOVA followed by Dunnett or Tukey test . Results are repre - sented as means ± standard deviations . A value of p < 0 . 05 was considered significant . Results Analysis of the effects of IAPP stimulation in vitro As described previously [ 20 , 21 ] , the co - culturing of endothelial cells and HBVP resulted in self - assembled cell clusters connected by branches , resembling a network of capillaries without lumen ( capillary - like structures , CLS ) ( Fig . 1A , B ) . The CLS consisted of HBVPs tightly associated with the elongated endothelial cells . Many of HBVP were localized in the peripheral part along the branch ( Fig . 1C , D ) . After stimulating the CLS with oli - gomeric IAPP ( oIAPP ) for 12 h , the HBVP displayed a round shape more frequently ( Fig . 1C , D ) . The number of round HBVP per total number of HBVP was significantly higher compared to vehicle condition , which predomi - nantly contained HBVP with an elongated morphology ( Fig . 1C – E ) . To exclude that these morphological changes were due to apoptosis / necrosis , we stained with trypan blue , which specifically labels dead cells ( Fig . 1F , G ) . We detected a very low proportion of trypan blue - positive round HBVP ( less than 10 % ) , and there were no signifi - cant differences between stimulations with oIAPP and vehicle ( Fig . 1H ) . Validation of the microvascular model Since the oIAPP - induced changes in HBVP could not be explained by cell death , we investigated whether a round HBVP morphology is associated with contractile proper - ties . Therefore , we analyzed the morphology after stimu - lating with the vasoconstrictor sphingosine 1 - phosphate [ 22 , 23 ] , and the ROCK inhibitor Y27632 , a vasodilator [ 24 ] . Compared with the vehicle condition ( Fig . 2A ) , the stimulation with S1P ( Fig . 2B ) resulted in a significantly higher proportion of round HBVP , whereas after the treatment with Y27632 ( Fig . 2D ) this proportion was sig - nificantly lower ( Fig . 2E , F ) . Stimulation with agonists and an antagonist of oIAPP Next , we aimed to investigate whether the impact of oIAPP on HBVP morphology is mediated via the IAPP receptor . We challenged the CLS with oIAPP together with the IAPP receptor antagonist AC187 [ 25 ] and found that the proportion of oIAPP - induced round HBVPs was no longer significantly higher compared to vehi - cle , but no significant difference was detected between oIAPP and oIAPP + AC187 treatments ( 0 . 359 ± 0 . 050 vs 0 . 277 ± 0 . 078 , p = 0 . 094 ) ( Fig . 3A – D ) . We also challenged our model with the IAPP receptor agonist pramlintide but found no alteration in the proportion of round HBVP ( Fig . 3E – G ) . Stimulation with IAPP combined with Y27632 , pramlintide , or blebbistatin To investigate the possibility to reverse the impact of oIAPP on HBVP morphology , we challenged the micro - vascular model with oIAPP together with either Y27632 , pramlintide , or blebbistatin , an inhibitor of muscle and non - muscle myosin II [ 26 ] ( Fig . 4A – E ) . All three mol - ecules were able to reverse the impact of oIAPP , and the number of round HBVP was significantly lower in these conditions compared with the stimulation with only oIAPP ( Fig . 4F , G ) . Supplementation with Y27632 together with oIAPP yielded additionally significantly lower number of round HBVP compared to vehicle . Page 5 of 11 Nuñez‑Diaz et al .

Molecular Brain ( 2023 ) 16 : 25 Quantification of vessel diameter in human brain tissue Finally , to investigate the potential association between brain IAPP levels and mural cell contraction in clinical material , we analyzed the diameter of laminin - enclosed capillaries in the CA1 hippocampal region of neuro - pathologically evaluated individuals ( n = 8 ) . Levels of total IAPP in homogenates from this region of these indi - viduals have been analyzed previously [ 19 ] and the indi - viduals were divided into two groups : high ( n = 4 ) and low ( n = 4 ) IAPP levels . Table 1 shows gender , age , neu - ropathological assessment ( ABC staging and Lewy Bod - ies ) , presence of T2DM , total IAPP levels , postmortem delay , and cause of death of the individuals included in the analysis . The diameter of laminin - enclosed capillar - ies near mural cells was significantly lower in individuals with high levels of total IAPP ( Fig . 5C ) . The diameter of laminin - enclosed capillaries with no visible laminin - enclosed mural cells was also significantly lower in individuals with high total IAPP levels ( Fig . 5D ) . To inves - tigate whether the mural cell morphology is also affected in individuals with high levels of IAPP , we analyzed the height of the laminin - enclosed mural cell bodies ( repre - sentative images in Fig . 5E , F ) . The analysis showed that individuals with high levels of IAPP showed significantly higher height compared to individuals with low levels of IAPP ( Fig . 5G ) .

Molecular Brain ( 2023 ) 16 : 25 Discussion The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of oIAPP on HBVP morphology and contractility using an in vitro microvascular model . Using the microvascu - lar model , we demonstrated that oIAPP cause changes in HBVP morphology , displaying a round shape more frequently . The morphological changes could not be explained by increased HBVP death , as the proportion of dead cells was very low compared with the total num - ber of round HBVP and was not significantly increased by oIAPP stimulation . We , therefore , explored the impact of oIAPP on HBVP tone . The contractile prop - erties of HBVP involve myosin regulatory light chain 9 [ 27 ] , as well as the RhoA / ROCK pathway [ 28 ] . Whether oIAPP affects this pathway has not been described before , but Aβ oligomers , which share many proper - ties with oIAPP [ 29 ] , are known to both activate ROCK [ 30 ] and to induce pericyte contraction [ 31 ] . Hence , to investigate if HBVP morphological changes were due to contraction , we stimulated our model with the vaso - constrictor sphingosine 1 - phosphate , an activator of the RhoA / ROCK pathway [ 22 , 23 ] , and the ROCK inhibi - tor Y27632 , a vasodilator [ 24 ] , alone and together with oIAPP . Indeed , S1P alone mimicked the effects of oIAPP on HBVP morphology , and both Y27632 and blebbista - tin , a myosin inhibitor [ 26 ] , reverted the effect of oIAPP on HBVP morphology . Of note , all three substances ( S1P , blebbistation and Y27632 ) have been shown to affect endothelial cells in different ways . S1P promotes for example endothelial barrier protection [ 32 , 33 ] and acti - vates the endothelial RhoA / ROCK pathway [ 34 ] , while altered endothelial calcium wave propagation [ 35 ] and endothelial cell basal tone and tension [ 36 ] have been found after blebbistatin stimulation . Y27632 has been shown to suppress endothelial RhoA / ROCK activation and improve endothelial cell viability [ 37 ] and in addi - tion increasing the expression of the vascular endothe - lial ( VE ) - cadherin in cell - to - cell junctions [ 38 ] . In view of the known impact of these substances on endothelial cells , we can only assume that the endothelial cells in our model are also affected in our experiments . Hence , given the tight reciprocal communication between endothelial cells and pericytes [ 39 ] , we cannot exclude the possibility that the found pericyte reaction ( contraction or relaxa - tion depending on substances ) could partly be a result of an indirect pericyte response to endothelial cell reac - tions to the three substances . Nevertheless , our finding suggest that oIAPP , indirectly or directly , and just like Aβ , induce HBVP contraction , and that this induction might be mediated via the RhoA / ROCK pathway . To date there are no studies ( to our knowledge ) demonstrating a direct impact of oIAPP in the RhoA / ROCK pathway , but since oIAPP ( just like Aβ oligomers ) binds to the receptor for advanced glycation end products ( RAGE ) [ 40 ] , and this receptor is in turn known to activate RhoA / ROCK path - way in different cell types ( including retinal pericytes [ 41 ] , microvascular pulmonary endothelial cells [ 42 ] and BV2 microglial cells [ 43 ] ) , we speculate that oIAPP induced the contraction in our experiments via RAGE . The impact of IAPP on mural cell contraction in humans has not been reported before , but there are a few studies describing an effect of IAPP on the vascular tone Fig . 5 Analysis of capillary diameter in human tissue .

One study indicated that rat IAPP ( rIAPP ) induced relaxa - tion of rat pulmonary arteries [ 44 ] , while another study revealed reduced relaxation of rat mesenteric arteries after rIAPP treatment [ 45 ] . Of note , rodent IAPP is non - aggregative , and , hence , corresponds to the monomeric and more beneficial version of human IAPP . In addition , these experiments were performed in arteries , whose mural cells may respond to IAPP in a different way com - pared to the ones in capillaries . Our study , where we used a microvascular model to mimic human capillaries , dem - onstrate that oIAPP induces a key morphological hall - mark of contraction in HBVP . These findings were further backed - up by our human postmortem study , where we analyzed the brain capillaries of individuals with high and low levels of IAPP . Our results show that individuals with high levels of total hippocampal IAPP display sig - nificantly smaller laminin - enclosed capillary diameters as well as a significantly lower number of laminin - enclosed mural cells with a flattened morphology in CA1 . Of note , the shift from elongated flat morphology to a more tri - angular morphology has previously been described as an indication of pericyte migration [ 46 ] . Hence , although a number of studies support the idea that pericyte , in addi - tion to smooth muscle cells , have contractile properties ( for review see [ 47 ] ) , we cannot rule out that migration of pericytes in the analyzed individuals might have affected the results . Moreover , the ELISA used for analysis of hip - pocampal IAPP does not distinguish between aggrega - tion forms , and hence our results do not reveal whether the reduced capillary diameter is related to oIAPP levels or higher amount of IAPP in general ( i . e . monomers , oli - gomer or fibrils ) . It should further be emphazised that previous studies have shown an impact of Aβ on peri - cyte contraction [ 29 ] , therefore , we selected cases with no or very scarce amyloid pathology in the hippocam - pus . However , most elderly individuals display some Aβ pathology , despite the lack of neurodegenerative changes linked to Alzheimer’s dementia or other dementia forms . Therefore , we cannot completely rule out the possibility that Aβ pathology , not captured by the neuropathological evaluation ( such as Aβ oligomers ) , also has an impact on the analyzed capillary diameter . In addition , the number of cases included in the study was low ( due to shortage of cases completely free from Aβ pathology ) , which is a limitation of the study . Nevertheless , taken together , our findings point towards a direct impact of IAPP on mural cells , inducing capillary contraction in humans . Next , we investigated the role of IAPP receptor in the morphological changes observed in the HBVP in our model . The IAPP receptor ( AMY ) is a heterodimer consisting of the calcitonin receptor ( CTR ) and a recep - tor activity - modifying protein ( RAMP ) [ 48 ] . There are 6 isoforms of the receptor ( AMY 1 - 3 ( a / b ) ) , formed by com - binations of CTRa / CTRb with RAMP 1 – 3 , and the dis - tribution of the isoforms in different tissues is difficult to assess [ 1 ] . Interestingly , our results did not show a clear involvement of the receptor in oIAPP - induced HBVP contraction . Although the mean proportion of round HBVP after supplementation with the AMY receptor antagonist AC187 together with oIAPP did not signifi - cantly differ from vehicle , it did not either differ from the proportion of round HBVP after oIAPP stimulation alone . In addition , stimulation of the receptor with IAPP agonist pramlintide had no effect . This could be explained by the fact that different isoforms of the receptor have different affinities for oIAPP , AC187 , and pramlintide . In addition , while it is known that the AMY receptor has an affinity for IAPP in its monomeric / non - aggregative form , little is known about its affinity for oIAPP . Hence , it is important to consider other pathways potentially influenced by oIAPP , such as membrane permeabiliza - tion , alternative receptors , or other mechanisms of cell transport . For example , human IAPP ( hIAPP ) oligomers are known to form pores , which lead to the disruption of membrane integrity and an increase in reactive oxygen species [ 49 ] . hIAPP can also form channels permeable for Na + , K + , Ca 2 + , and Cl − in lipid bilayer membranes [ 50 ] . Whether the latter mechanism also occurs in mural cells has not been investigated yet , but if it does , it is tempt - ing to speculate that this leads to increased intracellular concentration of Ca 2 + , which , in turn , would increase contraction and eventually lead to apoptosis . Also , other receptors beside the AMY receptor may be implicated . For example oIAPP also binds to RAGE [ 51 , 52 ] . This receptor , which is found on pericytes [ 53 , 54 ] , is known to mediate the toxic effects induced by IAPP in pancre - atic β - cells [ 51 ] . Hence , we cannot rule out the possibil - ity that RAGE or other receptors with affinity for IAPP are also involved in the oIAPP - induced HBVP morpho - logical changes shown in this study . Finally , oIAPP might also be internalized by mural cells via different mecha - nisms of cellular transport and thereby cause morpho - logical changes . A support for this idea can be found in studies describing an uptake of oIAPP via translocation , micropinocytosis , and clathrin - mediated endocytosis in pancreatic β - cells [ 55 ] . All these possible mechanisms of oIAPP might act alone or combined , provoking the mor - phological changes we detected in the HBVP / mural cells . Although the AMY receptor antagonist AC187 was unable to revert oIAPP - induced morphological changes in HBVP , we found that Y27632 , blebbistatin , and pramlintide had a potent reversal effect . Both Y27632 and blebbistatin are inhibitors of contraction [ 24 , 26 ] , which supports the idea that oIAPP induces an increase in HBVP contraction . Regarding the mechanism of Page 9 of 11 Nuñez‑Diaz et al . Molecular Brain ( 2023 ) 16 : 25 action of pramlintide , it might be explained by a physi - cal interaction with IAPP since previous studies have shown that pramlintide inhibits hIAPP aggregation in vitro [ 56 ] . Another possible mechanism could be that pramlintide competes with oIAPP for the same recep - tors and given its non - aggregative nature , pramlint - ide binding elicits a counteracting effect on the HBVP . From this perspective it is noteworthy that pramlintide , an FDA approved drug used together with insulin for T2DM treatment , has well - described beneficial effects . Apart from mimicking the physiological effects of mon - omeric IAPP [ 57 ] , pramlintide improves learning and memory function in diabetic rats [ 58 ] , and reverts the depression of the long - term potentiation caused by Aβ and oIAPP in mouse brain slices [ 59 ] . Besides , pram - lintide enhances the removal of Aβ from the brain over the BBB , increasing the trafficking of the low - density lipoprotein receptor - related protein 1 ( LRP - 1 ) , a well - known Aβ clearance transporter , to the membrane of endothelial cells in the BBB [ 14 ] . Since pericytes play an important role in this LRP - 1 mediated Aβ clear - ance [ 60 ] , it is tempting to speculate that the beneficial impact of pramlintide on Aβ clearance is in part medi - ated via its impact on pericyte / mural cell functionality as seen in our study . Finally , the model used in our study admit investiga - tions on HBVP when interacting with endothelial cells , which is different from monolayered in vitro mod - els . Such system is useful when investigating isolated events ( such as oIAPP exposure ) , but it is important to point out that cell cultures can never replicate a biolog - ical system . Nevertheless , our findings point towards a contraction effect of oIAPP on pericytes , and that this contraction can be reverted by pramlintide and con - traction inhibitors . The significance of these findings may be several - fold . First , given that mural cells , like pericytes , regulate basal capillary blood flow resist - ance in the brain [ 61 , 62 ] , vascular accumulation of aggregated IAPP , as seen in demented T2DM patients and patients with AD , may underly the reduced blood flow in these patients . Secondly , although our studies focus on the impact of IAPP on mural cells in the brain , it is likely that similar cells in the periphery and retina also respond to IAPP in a similar way , an idea impor - tant to consider in future research on vascular com - plications in T2DM ( such as retinopathy and diabetic foot ) . Thirdly , the ameliorating effect of pramlintide on oIAPP - induced contraction highlights the potential use of pramlintide not only for glucose control , but also to prevent vascular complications . Hence , we conclude that the impact of oIAPP on pericyte contraction might be an event important to target .
