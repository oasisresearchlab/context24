The cell rearrangement has been related with the micro - environmental restrictions to cell growth . Herein , an attempt is made to discuss and connect various modeling approaches on various time scales which have been proposed in the literature in order to shed further light to this complex phenomenon which induces micro - environmental restrictions to cell growth . The rearrangement is driven by internal stress generated within the cluster . The internal stress represents a consequence of the matrix rheological response to cell expansion . The rearrangement includes the interplay between the processes of : ( 1 ) single and collective cell migrations , ( 2 ) cell deformation and orientation , ( 3 ) decrease of cell - to - cell separation distances and ( 4 ) cell growth . It has been considered on two time scales : a short time scale ( i . e . the rearrangement time ) and a long time scale ( i . e . the growing time ) . The results indicate that short and long times cell rearrangement induces energy dissipation . The dissipation provokes biological responses of cells which cause the resistance effects to cell growth . Deeper insight in the anomalous nature of the energy dissipation would be useful for understanding the biological mechanisms which causes the resistance effects to cell growth . Keywords Cell rearrangement , extracellular matrix , immobilized cell cluster , internal stress , mathematical modeling History Received 31 May 2013 Revised 29 November 2013 Accepted 22 January 2014 Published online 18 March 2014 Introduction Regulation of dynamics of immobilized cells growth depend - ently on external loading conditions has a fundamental role in various biotechnological and biomedical applications ( Cheng et al . , 2009 ; Leal - Egana et al . , 2011 ; Murray et al . , 1988 ; Pajic - Lijakovic et al . , 2007a , b ; Simpson et al . , 2004 ) . Therefore , if the relationship between cell dynamic environ - ment and cell functions is better understood , it is highly possible that a method by which cell functions can be regulated could be designed . Such regulation depends on rearrangement of cells within clusters . Micro - environmental restrictions include following steps : ( 1 ) immobilized clusters induce radial deformations of surrounding hydrogel matrix during the clusters expansion ( Leal - Egana et al . , 2011 ) , ( 2 ) radial deformations induce generation of the mechanical stress within the matrix around the clusters ( the external stress ) ( Cheng et al . , 2009 ; Leal - Egana et al . , 2011 ; Pajic - Lijakovic et al . , 2007a , b ) , ( 3 ) generated external stress around the clusters induces feedback generation of the internal stress within the cell clusters ( Cheng et al . , 2009 ; Perullini et al . , 2008 ) and ( 4 ) the internal stress provokes a biological response of cells ( Pajic - Lijakovic et al . , 2007a , b ; Simpson et al . , 2004 ) . It is also clear that cells have to pouch and destroy the matrix rather early in the process , in order to provide enough space for further growth ( Pajic - Lijakovic et al . , 2007a , b , 2008 , 2010 ) . Biological response includes growth and metabolic activity of immobilized cells . Shraiman ( 2005 ) correlated increase of internal stress with local growth rate . During expansion of the cluster parts , newborn cells intercalate between cells gradually decreasing distances between neighboring cells until it falls below a threshold and their growth stops ( Garcia - Bellido & Garcia - Bellido , 1998 ) . Variation of the local growth rate represents a consequence of the formation of local in - homogeneities of the packing density of cluster parts during the rearrangement ( Shraiman , 2005 ) . The rearrangement includes the processes of : ( 1 ) single and collective cell migrations , ( 2 ) cell deformation and orientation , ( 3 ) changes of cell - to - cell separation distances and ( 4 ) cell growth . The rearrangement under the internal stress occurs through many relaxation cycles . The relaxation cycles are obtained at two time scales ( the rearrangement and the growing times , t and (cid:2) ) which differ significantly by order of magnitude ( Cowin , 2004 ) . The complex phenom - enon studied can be described through many current equilib - rium states at ð t eq , (cid:2) Þ up to final equilibrium state ð t ! t eq , (cid:2) ! (cid:2) eq Þ . For every current equilibrium state , the total external mechanical stress generated within the matrix is equilibrated with the total internal mechanical stress within the cell clusters . Consequently , external mechanical stress influences internal stress within cell clusters .

Significant attempts have been made to estimate the mechanical behavior of single cells and rheological behavior of cell clusters ( Djordjevic et al . , 2003 ; Lardner & Pujara , 1980 ; Peeters et al . , 2003 ; Skalak et al . , 1973 ) . However , little has been reported about the course – consequence relationship between the internal stress and dynamics of cell growth through cell rearrangement . The aim of this contribution is to discuss various modeling considerations which have been applied to describe the rearrangement of immobilized cell clusters under the internal stress . The short - time changes of the internal stress have been proposed by Djordjevic et al . ( 2003 ) and Plavsic et al . ( 2010 ) while the long - time changes have been proposed by Shraiman ( 2005 ) , Harris et al . ( 1981 ) and Murray et al . ( 1988 ) . The internal stress drives the cell rearrangement and induces the cluster strain . The short - time changes of the cluster strain have been described statistically by applying : ( 1 ) Eyring model ( Marmottant et al . , 2009 ) and ( 2 ) Edwards model ( Plavsic et al . , 2010 ) . The long - time changes of the strain have been correlated with the packing density of cells as reported by Murray et al . ( 1988 ) . The rearrangement consists of reversible and irreversible parts of the phenomenon . The irreversible nature of the cluster response could be described thermodynamically by applying the internal variable theory ( Atanackovic , 2002 ; Coleman & Gurtin , 1967 ; Trumel et al . , 2001 ) . It offers the possibility to formulate the change of the free energy of the rearrangement . The cell rearrangement has been treated as order – disorder phase transitions as reported by Volfson et al . ( 2008 ) and Pajic - Lijakovic et al . ( 2008 , 2010 ) . This approach includes the relationship between the free energy of the rearrangement and the order parameter . The cell rearrangement causes the energy dissipation . The nature of the energy dissipation obtained on various time scales as well as the impact of the dissipation on the rearrangement of cells and the growing conditions is considered based on various modeling approaches that have been proposed in the literature . Short - time and long - time rearrangement of cells – modeling considerations Long - time dynamics of cluster expansion induces radial deformation of the matrix in the boundary layer around the cluster ( Leal - Egana et al . , 2011 ) . Radial deformation consists of reversible and irreversible parts dependently on rheological behavior of the matrix and cell type ( Pajic - Lijakovic et al . , 2007a , b ) . Radial deformation causes generation of the external stress within the boundary layer . The external stress induces generation of the internal stress within cell cluster . The internal stress drives the rearrangement . Schematic representation of this complex phenomenon is shown in Figure 1 . Dynamics of change of the state of cell cluster within the extra - cellular matrix occurs through many relaxation cycles during the growing - time (cid:2) . Duration of the single relaxation cycle is t 2 ½ 0 , t eq (cid:2) where t is the cell rearrangement time such that t (cid:3)(cid:3) (cid:2) . Every relaxation cycle of the cluster is caused by a steep increase of the local number of cells D N ð x , (cid:2) Þ in the cluster parts . It induces the generation of the local internal stress within the clusters parts caused by the local increase of the packing density of cells n ð x , t , (cid:2) Þ ( Murray et al . , 1988 ) . During the single relaxation cycle , the cluster parts could be treated thermodynamically as the closed system and statis - tically as the canonical ensemble . These simultaneous matrix and cell cluster relaxation cycles during the growing time period include rearrangement of both the cells and the matrix . At the end of the single relaxation cycles the external and the internal stresses are equilibrated : (cid:3) cT x , t eq , (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:3) ¼ (cid:3) m x , t eq , (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:3) ð 1 Þ where (cid:3) cT ð x , t eq , (cid:2) Þ is the component of the local internal stress within the cell cluster and (cid:3) m ð x , t eq , (cid:2) Þ is the component of the local external stress within the matrix in the boundary layer around the cluster . The cell rearrangement will be discussed based on rheological , thermodynamical and statis - tical approaches in correlation with research results from the existing literature . Short - time relaxation of the internal stress Soft cellular clusters behave rheologicaly as visco - elastic materials . Djordjevic et al . ( 2003 ) proposed the fraction type of Zener equation for the relaxation of the local internal stress (cid:3) cT ð x , t , (cid:2) Þ generated within the muscular tissue under oscillatory loading conditions in the form : T (cid:4) C C 0 D (cid:4) t (cid:3) cT x , t , (cid:2) ð Þ ð Þ þ (cid:3) cT x , t , (cid:2) ð Þ ¼ G s " T x , t , (cid:2) ð Þ þ (cid:5) eff C 0 D (cid:4) t " T x , t , (cid:2) ð Þ ð 2 Þ where t is the rearrangement time , T C is the relaxation time during single relaxation cycle , G s is the static modulus , (cid:5) eff is the effective viscosity , " T ð x , t , (cid:2) Þ is the component of the local strain tensor of the cluster , C 0 D (cid:4) t i (cid:4)ðÞ ¼ d (cid:4) d t (cid:4) i (cid:4)ðÞ is the Caputo’s fractional derivative , while (cid:4) is the order of the fractional derivatives such that (cid:4) (cid:3) 1 . It corresponds to the damping Figure 1 . Schematic representation of the cell rearrangement within the cluster entrapped in the extra - cellular matrix .

The cause of the damping effects could be connected with the activation of bio - mechanical mechanisms of cell responses . Single bio - logical cells as well as cell clusters represent the bio - systems with the multilevel organization . Caputo’s definition of the fractional derivative of some function , f t ð Þ , was used and it is given as follows ( Podlubny , 1999 ) : C 0 D (cid:4) t f t ð Þ ð Þ ¼ 1 (cid:2) 1 (cid:5) (cid:4) ð Þ d d t Z t 0 f t 0 ð Þ 1 ð Þ t (cid:5) t 0 ð Þ (cid:4) d t 0 ð 3 Þ where t is an independent variable ( time ) , (cid:4) is the order of the fractional derivative , (cid:2) ð 1 (cid:5) (cid:4) Þ is the gamma function . If the parameter (cid:4) is (cid:4) ¼ 0 , we obtain C 0 D 0 t ð f ð t ÞÞ ¼ f ð t Þ . When (cid:4) ¼ 1 , the corresponding gamma function (cid:2) ð 1 (cid:5) (cid:4) Þ ! 1 . For this case , the fractional derivative is not defined . However , it can be shown , that in the limit when (cid:4) ! 1 , follows C 0 D 1 t ð f ð t ÞÞ ! d f ð t Þ d t . If the parameter (cid:4) is (cid:4) ¼ 0 , it follows to C 0 D 0 t ð (cid:3) cT ð x , t , (cid:2) ÞÞ ¼ (cid:3) cT ð x , t , (cid:2) Þ and C 0 D 0 t ð " T ð x , t , (cid:2) ÞÞ ¼ " T ð x , t , (cid:2) Þ . For such case , the second terms of the left and right sides of Equation ( 2 ) additionally contribute to elastic Hookean behavior . When (cid:4) ! 1 , it follows to C 0 D 1 t ð (cid:3) cT ð x , t , (cid:2) ÞÞ ¼ d (cid:3) cT ð x , t , (cid:2) Þ d t and C 0 D 1 t ð " T ð x , t , (cid:2) ÞÞ ¼ d " T ð x , t , (cid:2) Þ d t . For such case , the second terms represent the purely viscous contribution to the total internal stress . Zener - type model equation includes simultaneous relaxation of the internal stress and the strain within the cluster parts . The local internal stress drives the rearrangement of cells within the cluster parts . It induces changes of the local free energy . These changes have been expressed by applying the internal variable theory ( Atanackovic , 2002 ; Coleman & Gurtin , 1967 ; Trumel et al . , 2001 ) . The state of the systems is described by the local strain component " T ð x , t , (cid:2) Þ and the internal variable (cid:6) ð x , t , (cid:2) Þ . The internal variable represents the irreversible part of the local strain . Consequently , thermodynamic variables expressed per volume of the cluster part as : u ð x , t , (cid:2) Þ the internal energy , s ð x , t , (cid:2) Þ the entropy and the Helmholtz free energy F rea ð x , t , (cid:2) Þ is equal to F rea ð x , t , (cid:2) Þ ¼ u ð x , t , (cid:2) Þ (cid:5) Ts ð x , t , (cid:2) Þ depends on the local strain component " T ð x , t , (cid:2) Þ and the internal variable (cid:6) ð x , t , (cid:2) Þ . During single relaxation cycle the cluster part is treated as thermodynamic closed system . Changes of the Helmholtz free energy must be related with irreversible nature of the cell rearrangement by introducing the anomalous nature of energy dissipation effects . Atanackovic ( 2002 ) proposed the changes of the free energy , which corresponds to the fractional Zener model Equation ( 2 ) in the form : C 0 D (cid:4) t F rea x , t , (cid:2) ð Þ ð Þ ¼ (cid:3) cT x , t , (cid:2) ð Þ C 0 D (cid:4) t " T x , t , (cid:2) ð Þ ð Þ (cid:5) (cid:3) x , t , (cid:2) ð Þ C 0 D (cid:4) t (cid:6) x , t , (cid:2) ð Þ ð Þ ð 4 Þ where (cid:3) ð x , t , (cid:2) Þ represents the irreversible part of the total internal stress (cid:3) cT ð x , t , (cid:2) Þ . The rearrangement has been described thermodynamically as the order - disorder phase transition under action of compression stress by formulating the order parameter ( Ala - Nissila et al . , 2004 ; Volfson et al . , 2008 ) . In these models , the free energy F rea ð x , t , (cid:2) Þ is related with the order parameter in the form of Ginzburg – Landau free energy functional as reported by Ala - Nissila et al . ( 2004 ) . Volfson et al . ( 2008 ) formulated the order parameter for short - time dynamics of the rearrangement as the periodic function , which is in accordance with dynamics of the cell rearrange - ment . It was expressed as : (cid:4) C ð x , t , (cid:2) Þ ¼ ½ð cos 2 ’ ð x , t , (cid:2) ÞÞ 2 þ ð sin 2 ’ ð x , t , (cid:2) ÞÞ 2 (cid:2) 1 = 2 ( where ’ ð x , t , (cid:2) Þ is the angle between cell axes ) . Values of the order parameter is in the range (cid:4) C 2 ½ 0 , 1 (cid:2) . It is equal to zero for the completely disordered cell cluster part and equal to one for the ordered one . Plavsic et al . ( 2010 ) proposed a statistical approach in the form of the virial stress for describing the internal stress within the cluster parts during the single relaxation cycle . The virial stress is suitable for describing the internal stress within the clusters for weak loading conditions . Lega & Passot ( 2003 ) proposed the virial stress as suitable for cells within liquid matrix under action of shear stress . It includes the kinetic and potential energetic contributions . On the bases of that , the component of the stress tensor will be expressed as : (cid:3) cT x , t , (cid:2) ð Þ ¼ 1 V cT x , t , (cid:2) ð Þ X N x , (cid:2) ð Þ i ¼ 1 m i v i v i þ X N t ð Þ i ¼ 1 X # t ð Þ j ¼ 1 r ij @ (cid:7) ij @ r i " # ð 5 Þ where V cT ð x , t , (cid:2) Þ is the volume of the cluster part , m i is the mass of single cells and v i is the cell velocity , # t ð Þ is the number of nearest neighbors in contact with cell i . Cells motion has been interpreted as the motion of Brownian particles but produced by its own energy ( Ebeling et al . , 1999 ) . The force on cell i due to interaction with cell j is F ij ¼ @ (cid:7) ij @ r i , while r ij is the distance vector between cells i and j . Long - time relaxation of the internal stress Shraiman ( 2005 ) correlated the component of the internal stress with the local growth rate . Long - time changes of the internal stress is expressed rheo - kinetically in the form : T C d (cid:3) cT x , t eq , (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:3) d (cid:2) þ (cid:3) cT x , t eq , (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:3) ¼ T C (cid:8) CT K C K C þ (cid:8) CL (cid:8) c x , t eq , (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:5) (cid:8) c t eq , (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:4) (cid:5) (cid:6) (cid:7) ð 6 Þ where K C is the volumetric modulus of cell cluster , (cid:8) CL is the shear modulus of cell cluster , T C is the relaxation time of cells on compression effects caused by the cluster expansion , (cid:8) c ð x , t eq , (cid:2) Þ is the local kinetic constant for cell growth , h (cid:8) c ð t eq , (cid:2) Þi is the spatially averaged kinetic constant . The left hand side of Equation ( 6 ) describes the internal stress relaxation during the growing time period . It is important to note that the left hand sides of Equations ( 2 ) and ( 6 ) are similar . The only difference is given in the order of the derivative . Djordjevic et al . ( 2003 ) pointed to the anomalous nature of the internal stress short - time relaxation described by the fractional derivative . It corresponds to the order of the derivative (cid:4) (cid:3) 1 . However , Shraiman ( 2005 ) neglected the anomalous nature of energy dissipation during the long - time rearrangement . He proposed the order of the derivative (cid:4) ! 1 . The right hand side of Equation ( 6 ) describes change of the internal stress caused by local in - homogeneity of the packing density of the cluster . 404 I . Pajic - Lijakovic Crit Rev Biotechnol , 2015 ; 35 ( 3 ) : 402 – 409 D o w n l o a d e d by [ UN S W L i b r a r y ] a t 19 : 50 28 A ugu s t 2015 Harris et al . ( 1981 ) and Murray et al . ( 1988 ) related the local internal stress with the packing density of cells . Harris et al . ( 1981 ) proposed the expression of the component of the internal stress for adherent cells in the form : (cid:3) cT x , t eq , (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:3) ¼ k 1 n x , t eq , (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:3) k 2 þ k 3 n x , t eq , (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:3) 2 ð 7 Þ where n ð x , t eq , (cid:2) Þ is the local packing density of cells for the corresponding time set ð t eq , (cid:2) Þ , k 1 , k 2 , k 3 are the constitutive parameters which depend on cell type . Increase of the packing density induces increase of the internal stress up to maximum value and further decreases caused by contact inhibition between cells . Murray et al . ( 1988 ) pointed that the internal stress depends on both the cell packing density and the density of the extra - cellular matrix in the boundary layer around the cluster . They expanded the relation proposed by Harris et al . ( 1981 ) and formulated the expression for the component of the internal stress as : (cid:3) cT x , t eq , (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:3) ¼ k 1 n x , t eq , (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:3) k 2 þ k 3 n x , t eq , (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:3) 2 (cid:9) m x , t eq , (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:2) þ (cid:10) r 2 (cid:9) m x , t eq , (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:3)(cid:3) ð 8 Þ where (cid:9) m ð x , t eq , (cid:2) Þ is the local density of the extra - cellular matrix , (cid:10) is the constitutive parameter of the matrix . Structural ordering of the matrix caused by cell cluster expansion is quantified by the local density of matrix and its local gradient . The long - time changes of the local internal stress induce changes of the local free energy of the rearrangement . The anomalous nature of the energy dissipation during the long - time cell rearrangement has been neglected as proposed by Shraiman ( 2005 ) . During the growing time period , the cell cluster behaves as thermodynamical open system . For the isothermal condition , long - time changes of the Helmholtz free energy F rea ð x , t eq , (cid:2) Þ that correspond to the constitutive Equations ( 6 – 8 ) could be expressed as : d F rea x , t eq , (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:3) d (cid:2) ¼ (cid:3) cT x , t , (cid:2) ð Þ d n x , t eq , (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:3) d (cid:2) (cid:5) (cid:3) x , t , (cid:2) ð Þ d (cid:6) x , t eq , (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:3) d (cid:2) ð 9 Þ where the strain component " T ð x , t eq , (cid:2) Þ is related with the local packing density n ð x , t eq , (cid:2) Þ as reported by Murray et al . ( 1988 ) . The long - time changes of the free energy from Equation ( 9 ) are expressed using the order of the derivative (cid:4) ! 1 which corresponds to the changes of the internal stress proposed by Shraiman ( 2005 ) in Equation ( 6 ) . The long - time rearrangement could be described thermodynamically as the order – disorder phase transition under action of compression stress by formulating the order parameter . For long - time dynamics , Pajic - Lijakovic et al . ( 2008 ) used the number of cells per micro - bead volume while Murray et al . ( 1988 ) used the packing density of cells as the number of cells per volume of the cell cluster . Short - time changes of the local strain of the cluster For further modeling considerations , it is necessary to express the local strain of the cell cluster from Equation ( 2 ) . Marmottant et al . ( 2009 ) and Plavsic et al . ( 2010 ) proposed statistical approaches . Marmottant et al . ( 2009 ) expressed the local strain as the sum of the elastic and the rearrangement contributions as : " T x , t , (cid:2) ð Þ ¼ " cell þ " rea x , t , (cid:2) ð Þ ð 10 Þ where " T ð x , t , (cid:2) Þ is the local strain , " cell is the averaged strain of single cells , " rea ð x , t , (cid:2) Þ is the contribution to the local strain caused by the rearrangement . They applied Eyring model to describe the cell rearrangement caused by action of the internal stress . Marmottant et al . ( 2009 ) introduced the probability of the cell rearrangement in the direction of the stress and in the opposite direction as f (cid:6) ¼ fe (cid:5) D ET (cid:7) (cid:3) eVC (cid:11) " rea kT ( where f þ is the probability of the rearrangement in the direction of the stress , f (cid:5) is the probability of the rearrange - ment in the opposite direction , f is the characteristic frequency , D E T is the energy barrier , V C is the order of single cell volume , (cid:3) e is the elastic stress of single cell equal to (cid:3) e ¼ E c " cell , E c is the Young’s modulus of the single cell , (cid:3) e V C is the work gained during the rearrangement , k is the Boltzmann con - stant and T is the temperature ) . Short - time dynamics of the rearrangement has been described by the rearrangement strain as : d " rea x , t , (cid:2) ð Þ d t ¼ f þ (cid:5) f (cid:5) ð Þ (cid:11) " T ¼ (cid:3) (cid:8) (cid:5) (cid:8) sinh (cid:3) e x , t , (cid:2) ð Þ (cid:3) (cid:8) (cid:8) (cid:9) ð 11 Þ where (cid:3) (cid:8) is the characteristic stress equal to (cid:3) (cid:8) ¼ kTV C (cid:11) " T and (cid:5) (cid:8) is the characteristic viscosity equal to (cid:5) (cid:8) ¼ kT 2 fV C (cid:11) " 2 T e D ETkT . Plavsic et al . ( 2010 ) proposed Edward’s statistics ( Edwards , 2005 ; Edwards & Grinev , 1988 ) for describing the strain of the cluster part . State of cells located at x during single relaxation cycle ð 0 (cid:5) t eq , (cid:2) Þ has been quantified by the averaged volume v T ð x , t , (cid:2) Þ which is equal to v T ð x , t , (cid:2) Þ ¼ V C þ v F ð x , t , (cid:2) Þ ( where V C is the averaged volume of single cell under uncompressible condition and v F ð x , t , (cid:2) Þ is the free volume per single cell within the cluster part ) . The free volume depends on the packing conditions within the cluster . During the single relaxation cycle , the cluster has been considered statistically as the canonical ensemble . The component of the volumetric deformation tensor for short - time changes has been expressed as : F v x , t , (cid:2) ð Þ ¼ v T x , t , (cid:2) ð Þ v T x , 0 , (cid:2) ð Þ (cid:8) (cid:9) 1 = 3 ð 12 Þ where F v ð x , t , (cid:2) Þ is the component of the volumetric deform - ation tensor . The main task for the modeling considerations is to formulate changes of the volume of the cluster part V cT ð x , t , (cid:2) Þ as V cT ð x , t , (cid:2) Þ ¼ v T ð x , t , (cid:2) Þ N ð x , (cid:2) Þ ( where N ð x , (cid:2) Þ is the number of cells in the cluster part ) .

For estimation of possible values of w C for the cell clusters , the following formula can be used : w C x , t , (cid:2) ð Þ ¼ V min x , (cid:2) ð Þ þ ð V max x , (cid:2) ð Þ (cid:5) V C Þ (cid:13) x , t , (cid:2) ð Þ 2 ð 17 Þ where V min ð x , (cid:2) Þ and V max ð x , (cid:2) Þ are the minimum and the maximum volume a cell can occupy in a cluster during single relaxation cycle , (cid:13) represents its degree of freedom to adjust its position and orientation in the cluster . It can have values in the range from 0 to 1 . For loose packing of cells , we can take w C ¼ V max and a cell has high degree of freedom in such system so (cid:13) values are close to 1 , giving w C values close to V max . For dense packing , (cid:13) is close to 0 giving w C values close to V min . The parameter (cid:13) provides some possibilities to account effects of cell migration , orientation and deformation within the cluster part , using Equation ( 17 ) . The parameter (cid:13) for cells in the cluster could be related with the order parameter (cid:4) C ð x , t , (cid:2) Þ . The local order param - eter should be connected with the cell migration . It is in accordance with the fact that cell migration mainly contribute to the cell rearrangement .

Long - time changes of the cluster strain Murray et al . ( 1988 ) considered the long - time rearrangement of immobilized cells and correlated the component of the local strain with the packing density of cells . Cowin ( 2004 ) formulated the local strain tensor under loading conditions caused by cell growth as : ~ " T x , t , (cid:2) ð Þ ¼ 1 2 ~ F l x , t , (cid:2) ð Þ ~ F Tl x , t , (cid:2) ð Þ (cid:5) ~ I (cid:2) (cid:3) ð 18 Þ where ~ " T ð x , t , (cid:2) Þ is the strain tensor and ~ F l ð x , t , (cid:2) Þ is the deformation tensor . The long - time changes of the local deformation tensor are expressed as : d ~ F l x , t , (cid:2) ð Þ d (cid:2) ¼ ! ~ A l x , t ð Þ d f l ! (cid:2) ð Þ d (cid:2) ð 19 Þ where ~ A l ð x , t Þ is the amplitude tensor and f l ð ! (cid:2) Þ is undefined periodic function . Periodicity of the phenomenon is related with simultaneous relaxations of cell state to the state of the surrounding extra - cellular matrix during the growing time period . This periodic function should be also connected with the long - time changes of the order parameter . Cell migration The rearrangement of cells within the cluster parts is induced by the cell migration . Single cell migration has been considered statistically by applying Langevin type equations ( Ochab - Marcinek et al . , 2004 ; Smith et al . , 2006 ) . Collective cell migration is induced by local gradients of the convective , conductive and heptotaxis fluxes and dynamics of cell growth as reported by Murray et al . ( 1988 ) . It causes local in - homogeneities of the packing density of cells . The short - time dynamics of the rearrangement induces the anomalous nature of the energy dissipation as reported by Djordjevic et al . ( 2003 ) . Consequently , the corresponding short - time changes of the packing density could be expressed by modified the expression proposed by Murray et al . ( 1988 ) : C 0 D (cid:4) t n x , t , (cid:2) ð Þ ð Þ ¼ r J C x , t , (cid:2) ð Þ þ J D x , t , (cid:2) ð Þ þ J h x , t , (cid:2) ð Þ ½ (cid:2) ð 20 Þ where J D ð x , t , (cid:2) Þ is the local conductive flux , J c ð x , t , (cid:2) Þ is the local convective flux and J h ð x , t , (cid:2) Þ is the local heptotaxis flux . The order of the fractional derivative (cid:4) should be approximately the same as in Equation ( 2 ) . For the long - time changes of the local packing density of cells , Murray et al . ( 1988 ) proposed : d n x , t eq , (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:3) d (cid:2) ¼ (cid:8) eff n x , t eq , (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:5) bn x , t eq , (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:3) 2 þ r J C x , t eq , (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:3) þ J D x , t eq , (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:3) þ J h x , t eq , (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:6) (cid:7) ð 21 Þ where (cid:8) eff is the kinetic constant , b is the constitutive parameter which quantified cell – cell interactions . The kinetic constant (cid:8) eff should be related with the local kinetic constant for cell growth (cid:8) c ð x , t eq , (cid:2) Þ from Equation ( 6 ) . Results and discussion The results of this study points to the course – consequence relations between micro - environmental restrictions to cell growth and the short and long times changes of the internal stress within the immobilized cell cluster . Changes of the internal stress are caused by structural ordering of the extracellular matrix around the cluster during cell expansion . The structural ordering of the matrix leads to generation of the resistance effects . The resistance effects changes during the growth regimes . Cheng et al . ( 2009 ) and Pajic - Lijakovic ( 2013 ) established two regimes of growth for various immobilized cell clusters within the polysaccharide matrixes . The first regime corresponds to non - limited growth condi - tions . In this regime , the extra - cellular matrix deforms elastically . In the second regime , resistance effects within the matrix increase rapidly . It induces generation of the internal stress . Cheng et al . ( 2009 ) reported that the internal stress generated in the second regime increases up to 406 I . Pajic - Lijakovic Crit Rev Biotechnol , 2015 ; 35 ( 3 ) : 402 – 409 D o w n l o a d e d by [ UN S W L i b r a r y ] a t 19 : 50 28 A ugu s t 2015 3 : 73 (cid:5) 7 : 50 kPa for the cancer cells . Other immobilized cell types also generate the internal stress ( Murray et al . , 1988 ; Pajic - Lijakovic et al . , 2007b , 2010 ; Perullini et al . , 2008 ) . Rate of cell deformations under action of the internal stress leads to quiet different rheological behavior . Instantaneous deformation causes elastic response , while the slower deform - ation ( during the cell rearrangement ) leads to visco - elastic behavior as have been reported ( Djordjevic et al . , 2003 ; Lardner & Pujara , 1980 ; Marmottant et al . , 2009 ; Peeters et al . , 2003 ; Shraiman , 2005 ; Skalak et al . , 1973 ) . Visco - elasticity of the cluster includes reversible ( elastic ) and irreversible ( plastic ) contributions . Irreversible part of the cell rearrangement has been related with the micro - environmental restrictions to cell growth . I will estimate firstly the rheological behavior of single cells and further the rheological behavior of the immobilized cell cluster . Peeters et al . ( 2003 ) treated cells as Hookean elastic bodies under short time loading conditions . However , Skalak et al . ( 1973 ) , Lardner & Pujara ( 1980 ) considered various types of cells , from plant to animal , and proposed the non linear , Mooney – Rivlin form of the strain energy density of cells . Ability of single cells to deform has been quantified by the value of the Young’s modulus . The values of Young’s modulus for various cell types are different many order of magnitude . However , various cell types behave as the elastic bodies . Young’s modulus for animal cells is in the range of E c ¼ 0 : 1 (cid:5) 100 kPa ( Peeters et al . , 2003 ) . Young’s modulus for living cells is lower than for dead cells . Living cells are more elastic due to activation of various bio - mechanical mechanisms of cell responses . Cancer cells have the Young’s modulus less than 0 : 1 kPa ( Lekka et al . , 1999 ) . Yeast cells have much higher Young’s modulus than animal cells . It is equal to E c ¼ 112 (cid:6) 6 MPa for cells in the exponential growth phase and E c ¼ 107 (cid:6) 6 MPa for cells in stationary growth phase ( Smith et al . , 2000 ) . As was mention , the rheological behavior of the immobi - lized cell clusters during the short and long times rearrange - ment is visco - elastic . The short - time rearrangement has been described by the fractional Zener - type model equation by Djordjevic et al . ( 2003 ) . It represents the consequence of the anomalous nature of the energy dissipation during the cell rearrangement , which includes the damping effects . The anomalous nature of the energy dissipation could be connected with the cell migration . Upadhyaya et al . ( 2001 ) and Dieterich et al . ( 2007 ) have pointed to the anomalous nature of the cell migration . Plavsic et al . ( 2010 ) considered the internal stress in the form of the virial stress , which consists of kinetic and potential contributions . Both contri - butions are induced by the cell migration . The migration of cells includes superposition of various mechanical and molecular processes which lead to cell deformation and orientation in the cluster ( Friedi et al . , 2001 ; Lammermann & Sixt , 2009 ) . For the adherent cells , the migration depends on the stability of adhesion complex . When the number of bonds within the adhesion complex decreases , cell migrates to a new suitable location . Bruinsma ( 2005 ) modeled the dynamics of adhesion complex stability . Shapes of adherent cells as well as their orientation depend on the rheological behavior of extra - cellular matrix as reported by Ingber ( 2006 ) . Butler et al . ( 2002 ) expressed the strain energy of single cell as work of the traction force . They reported that the strain energy for single muscle cell on poly - acryl - amid gel is equal to 1 : 2 (cid:9) 10 (cid:5) 13 J . Evans ( 1995 ) reported that the contraction energy of single muscle cell is equal to 1 : 34 (cid:9) 10 (cid:5) 11 J . Kinetic energy of cells is the lowest . Rieu et al . ( 2000 ) reported that ectodermic and endodermic cells of hydra cluster have the velocities in the range 1 : 1 (cid:5) 1 : 6 (cid:8) m = min . It corresponds to the averaged kinetic energy equal to 1 : 42 (cid:9) 10 (cid:5) 28 J . Migration of non - adherent cells through dense cellular clusters corresponds to the sliding ( Rolli et al . , 2010 ) or to the amoeboid migration ( Guck et al . , 2010 ) . These mechanisms include cell deformation and passing through narrow channels between neighboring cells in the cluster . It is pronounced for cancer cells . For long - time dynamics , the internal stress changes have been described by the constitutive equation proposed by Shraiman ( 2005 ) . This constitutive equation connects the internal stress with the local kinetic constant of cell growth . Harris et al . ( 1981 ) and Murray et al . ( 1988 ) connected the long - time changes of the internal stress with the packing density of cells . These results point to the relationship between the local packing density of cells and the local kinetic constant of cell growth . Consequently , long - time changes of the packing density during the cell migration induce micro - environmental restrictions to cell growth . These changes of the packing density are induced by permanent decrease of cell - to - cell separation distances . Garcia - Bellido & Garcia - Bellido ( 1998 ) reported that permanent decrease of the distances between neighboring cells induces suppress cell growth . The modeling considerations of long - time dynamics have been neglected the anomalous nature of the energy dissipation during the rearrangement . However , this neglect - ing of the anomalous effects has not been discussed in the literature . The cell rearrangement connects the cause ( the internal stress ) and the consequence ( the strain ) . The main question which has been frequently asked in the literature is how to describe the strain of the cluster under action of the internal stress . For short - time dynamics of the rearrangement , statis - tical approaches have been proposed based on : ( 1 ) Eyring’s model ( Marmottant et al . , 2009 ) and ( 2 ) Edward’s model ( Plavsic et al . , 2010 ) . For long - time dynamics , the strain has been related with the packing density of cluster ( Murray et al . , 1988 ) . Eyring’s model introduced the concept of the energetic barrier to the cell rearrangement . The interesting question for the biological point of view is to connect the energetic barrier with cell functions . Edward’s model introduced the volume function by the analogy with Hamiltonian of cell cluster . Both models statistically describe energetic changes during the cell rearrangement . Accordingly , with the fact that cell migration is the primarily mechanism of the cell rearrangement , it is useful to consider the energetic changes of the single cells provoked by the migration . These results indicate that cell deformation and orientation caused by cell migration primarily influences the energetic effects of the cell rearrangement . The energy storage and dissipation during the cell rearrangement should be related with the irreversible part of the phenomenon . The short and long time changes of the free energy of the rearrangement have been described thermodynamically by applying the DOI : 10 . 3109 / 07388551 . 2014 . 889078 Micro - environmentally restricted cell growth dynamics 407 D o w n l o a d e d by [ UN S W L i b r a r y ] a t 19 : 50 28 A ugu s t 2015 internal variable theory . The internal variable is the useful tool for estimating the irreversible nature of the rearrange - ment which induces visco - elastic behavior of the cluster . From thermodynamical point of view , the rearrangement has been treated as the order – disorder phase transitions . Bischofs & Schwarz ( 2005 ) considered structural ordering of the soft cell clusters . They established three type of the structural ordering : ( 1 ) paraelastic , ( 2 ) ferroelastic and ( 3 ) anti - ferroelastic which exhibit various rheological behaviors . Poisson ratio is the lowest for the ferroelastic state . It is the highest for the anti - ferroelastic state . Disordering soft cell clusters are paraelastic . These models relate the free energy with the order parameter ( Ala - Nissila et al . , 2004 ; Pajic - Lijakovic et al . , 2008 ; Volfson et al . , 2008 ) . The order parameter depends on the structural changes of cell clusters and extracellular matrix as reported by Pajic - Lijakovic et al . ( 2007a , b ) . The results point that the short and long times changes of the packing density of cells induce the energy dissipation during the cell rearrangement which causes the micro - environmental restrictions to cell growth as was shown in Figure 2 . Deeper insight into anomalous nature of energy dissipation which causes dumping effects into cell responses to changes in the micro - environment is necessary from the biological point of view . Conclusions The considered models estimate complex physical , chemical and biological processes within the immobilized cell clusters obtained at different space and time scales . Comparison analyzes of various modeling approaches shed light on the essential mechanism of micro - environmentally restricted cell growth dynamics . The mechanism is connected which energetically perturbed cell states caused by action of internal stress . The perturbed cell states are product of cell deform - ation , orientation and changes of cell - to - cell separation distances . These cell states and the rate of their changes provoke activation of various mechanical and biological mechanisms to ensure cell adaptation to micro - environmental conditions . These mechanisms induce time delaying effects which lead to anomalous nature of energy transfer and dissipation through immobilized cell cluster . Anomalous nature of energy dissipation could be related with micro - environmentally restricted cell growth . Energy transfer and dissipation through the immobilized cell clusters are described by rheological constitutive equa - tions which correlate the internal stress to the strain of cell cluster . Various models have been proposed based on continuum mechanics and statistics . Bearing in minds that mathematical models represents only the simplified descrip - tion of this complex phenomenon , I point to importance of statistical approaches described in the form of Eyring’s and Edward’s models in understanding the dynamics at cellular level . For practical applications , it is necessary to consider structural changes of extracellular matrix near the immobi - lized cell clusters which results in generation of external stress . Regulation of external stress we can regulate the internal stress and the rate of its changes , which represents the key factor for micro - environmentally restricted cell growth dynamics .
