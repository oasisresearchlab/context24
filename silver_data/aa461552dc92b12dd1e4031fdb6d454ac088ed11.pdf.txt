For example , di - rectional migration of neutrophils , galvanotaxis of glioblastoma , and water flux in kidney cells , all result from the polarized distribution of membrane ion carriers and other intracellular com - ponents . The underlying physical mechanisms behind how polarized ion carriers interact with environmental signals are not well studied . Here , we use a physiologically - relevant , physics - based mathematical model to reveal how ion carriers generate intracellular ionic and voltage gradients . The model is able to discern the contribution of individual ion carriers to the intracellular pH gradient , electric potential , and water flux . We discover that an extracellular pH gradient leads to an intracellular pH gradient via chloride - bicarbonate exchangers , whereas an extracellular electric field leads to an intracellular electric potential gradient via passive potassium channels . In addition , the mechanical - biochemical coupling can modulate actin distribution and flow , and create biphasic dependence of the cell speed on water flux . Moreover , we find that F - actin interaction with NHE alone can generate cell movement , even when other ion carriers are not polarized . Taken together , the model shows the importance of cell ion dynamics in modulating cell migration and cytoskeletal dynamics . 1 Introduction In cells , the spatial distributions of proteins and organelles are often not uniform . A polarized cell is essential in many ( patho ) physiological processes such as morphogenesis , immune response , nutrient delivery and filtration , signal transduction , and cancer metastasis [ 1 , 2 ] . Many studies have examined how extracellular biochemical signals generate cell polarization and establish intracellular gradients [ 3 ] . Cell polarity influences cell cytoskeletal structure , force distribution , morphology , and migration [ 4 – 9 ] . Recent works have shown that even in the absence of extracellular signals , the extracellular fluid influence cell polarity , giving a polarized distribution of ion channels , exchangers , and pumps . [ 10 – 13 ] . ( Here , we will refer to these ion channels , exchangers , and pumps as membrane ion carriers . ) Epithelial cells and cells in confinement display polarized distributions of ion carriers at the two ends of the cells without extracellular signal gradients [ 11 , 14 – 16 ] . In contrast , unconfined cells on two - dimensional substrates show a lesser degree of ion carrier polarization [ 17 ] .

( Not to scale ) ion carriers can generate water fluxes across the cell membrane , contributing to processes such as cell shape change , epithelial fluid transport , and water - driven cell migration . Since fluxes through ion carriers ( and thus water ) are affected by electric potential , any external electric fields will also generate intracellular ionic gradients . Moreover , fluxes of major ions such as sodium , potassium , and chloride are influenced by proton flux . Since the tumor microenvironment often has an elevated pH [ 18 ] , and leukocytes [ 19 , 20 ] and cancer cells [ 14 – 17 ] both utilize sodium - hydrogen exchangers to migrate , it is important to understand how environmental pH changes influence cell ionic homeostasis and migration . In this paper , we explore how extracellular electric potential and pH gradients affect intracellular ionic distribution through ion carriers using a theo - retical model ( Fig . 1A ) . We also examine how a polarized distribution of ion carriers can generate intracellular gradients without external signals ( Fig . 1A ) . Since ions often interact strongly with proteins and genetic material , intracellular ionic gradients will contribute to intracellular protein biochemical gradients . In addition to confinement , polarized ion carriers can occur through spatially varying F - actin assembly and disassembly , which not only regulate the distribution of ion carriers through vesicular trafficking but also through direct physical interaction with membrane - embedded proteins [ 21 ] . Our earlier work demonstrated that actin co - localizes with sodium - hydrogen exchangers in confined breast cancer cells [ 16 ] and with sodium - potassium pumps in kidney cells [ 11 ] . Polarization of ion carriers will , in turn , affect intracellular cell homeostasis and biochemical gradients , forming feedback loops . A physiology - relevant , physics - based mathematical model has the potential to reveal cell migra - tion mechanisms and provide unique insights into critical biophysical processes that are difficult to obtain from experiments . In this work , we use such a mathematical model to study the effects of ( 1 ) polarized ion carriers on cell migration and homeostasis , ( 2 ) polarized extracellular chemical - physical environment on cell polarization , and ( 3 ) actin - chemical coupling in cell polarization and water flux . The model predicts cell migration speed and cytoplasmic distributions of ionic concen - trations , pH , and electric potential . We will also answer an interesting question : can there be just one single ion carrier responsible for sensing the cell microenvironment ? The model predictions will have medical or therapeutic implications where cell dynamics are regulated by pH or electric 2 potential [ 22 , 23 ] . 2 Method The current theoretical model builds on our early work on steady - state cell migration in one - dimensional geometric confinement , but adds explicit analysis of pH and individual ionic fluxes . The model , when generalized to higher dimensions , can describe cell migration in any condition . In our results , we use x ∈ [ 0 , L ] to represent the cytoplasmic domain in the moving frame of the cell ( Fig . 1B ) . The front of the cell is at x = L and the back is at x = 0 . The model includes cytosol , F - actin , osmolarity , water flux [ 24 ] , G - actin [ 25 ] , charged solutes , pH , and electric potential [ 15 , 26 ] . The cytosol and extracellular water are connected through membrane water flux , J water . Depending on the cell morphology and extracellular physical environments , cells can migrate via either actin - driven or water - driven or both [ 14 , 15 , 17 , 24 , 27 ] . The amount of water contribution to the cell velocity was shown to depend on the coefficient of extracellular hydraulic resistance [ 24 , 27 ] . In this work , we use a moderate hydraulic resistance so that a fraction ( approximately 2 . 5 % ) of water flux converts to cell velocity . This choice is arbitrary because the hydraulic resistance is a free parameter . In real situations , the extracellular hydraulic resistance depends on geometry and fluid permeability of the environment , and can be higher or lower than the value we are using , corresponding to a larger or smaller contribution to water - driven cell velocity [ 24 , 27 ] . In the cell , G - actin ( concentration θ c ) continuously polymerizes into F - actin ( concentration θ n ) through boundary actin polyermization fluxes at the cell front , J actin , and F - actin depolymerizes into G - actin in the cytoplasm with a rate , γ [ 25 , 28 ] . The charged solutes considered in the model include sodium ( Na + ) , potassium ( K + ) , chloride ( Cl − ) , hydrogen ion ( H + ) , bicarbonate ( HCO − 3 ) , deprotonated buffer ( Buf − ) , and non - permeable protein molecules ( A − ) . To model ion fluxes across ion carries on the cell membrane , we consider passive sodium ( Na , p ) , potassium ( K , p ) , and chloride ( Cl , p ) channels ; sodium - potassium pumps ( NKE ) , sodium - hydrogen exchangers ( NHE ) , and chloride - bicarbonate exchangers ( AE2 ) ( Fig . 1B ) . We use α i to represent the transport coefficient of each ion carrier , where i , such as i = NHE , is an index representing ion carriers . The transport coefficients depend on the activity and expression levels of the ion carriers . We quantify the degree of ion carrier polarization by the ratio α f i / α b i , where the superscripts ‘f’ and ‘b’ refer to the quantities associated with the front and back of the one - dimensional cell , respectively . We take carrier polarization as given , meaning that we do not investigate how ion carriers are polarized via vesicular trafficking mediated by the cytoskeleton [ 29 ] . When varying the ratio α f i / α b i , we keep the average transport coefficient fixed , i . e . , ( α f i + α b i ) / 2 = α i = const . for each carrier . In this way , we focus on the effects of polarization , not the overall permeability of each ion carrier . Below we introduce the new model development beyond our previous work . Many intracellular mechanical and biochemical processes are coupled to each other . Here we couple pH and NHE activity with the actin network using two known mechanisms . First , the rate of actin depolymerization , γ , depends on multiple mechanical and biochemical factors [ 30 ] , including pH [ 31 , 32 ] . Experimental data shows that higher pH leads to a higher rate of Cofilin - mediated actin depolymerization at the pointed end [ 31 , 32 ] . Therefore , we let γ = γ 0 + γ pH 1 + e − β γ ( pH − pH γ , c ) , ( 1 ) where pH is the local intracellular pH as a function of space . The intracellular pH is one of the 3 unknowns to be solved by the model . γ 0 is a baseline rate of actin depolymerization , and γ pH is the coefficient of pH - dependent rate of actin depolymerization . β γ and pH γ , c are two constants characterizing how γ depends on pH . Second , recent work showed that the activity of NHE correlates with F - actin density [ 16 ] . F - actin interacts with NHE through an actin binding protein , ezrin [ 21 , 33 ] . In this work , we will study , from a theoretical point of view , how this coupling affects cell ion homeostasis and migration . Since the membrane activity of NHE increases with increasing F - actin presence , we write the permeability coefficient of NHE as a function of F - actin concentration α f ( b ) NHE = α f ( b ) NHE , F " 1 + e − β F (cid:16) θ f ( b ) n / θ n , ∗ − β F , c (cid:17) # − 1 , ( 2 ) where θ f ( b ) n is the F - actin concentration evaluated at the front and back of the cell , respectively . α f ( b ) NHE , F is the baseline permeability coefficient , which depends on the cell type and the expression level . β F , β F , c , and θ n , ∗ are constants . If we remove the actin - dependence of NHE activity , we let α f ( b ) NHE = α f ( b ) NHE , F , which can be different at the two ends of the cell . A complete model description and parameters is provided in the Supplementary Materials . The chosen parameters represent typical mammalian tissue cells in physiological conditions , meaning these parameters generate pH , membrane potential , and ion concentrations within the expected physiological ranges . Cells in pathological conditions require a different parameter set . Given the potential variation from cell type to cell type , we do not focus on the particular results or numbers predicted by the model . Rather , we emphasize the mechanisms behind why the model predicts certain trends of cellular dynamics as functions of solute carrier polarizations , which can be observed in experiments via antibodies targeting specific carriers . 3 Results and Discussions In our prior work , we showed how actin - driven and water - driven cell migration are modulated by the extracellular fluid environment , matrix adhesion , solute flux , and actin turnover [ 24 , 25 , 27 , 28 ] . In particular , our models predict that polarized distributions of F - actin and actin retrograde flow towards the cell trailing edge as a result of the actin polymerization at the front . While F - actin polymerization is always polarized , the intracellular electro - neutral solute concentration , on the other hand , is evenly distributed if the solute flux is uniformly distributed across the cell mem - brane . This is still the case for the current model with multiple charged ions and ion carriers . We find that for a cell that resides in a uniform isotropic extracellular environment , without coupling between mechanical and biochemical processes , and without polarized ion carriers , every intracel - lular variable is uniform across the cell except for actin ( Fig . S1A ) . Interesting spatial variations in ions and electrical potential occur only when the cell is polarized or there is coupling between mechanical and biochemical processes in the cytoplasm . 3 . 1 Polarization of ion carriers leads to intracellular gradients Elongated cells have polarized distributions of ion carriers which enhance cell motility [ 15 , 16 ] . This polarization also induces intracellular pH , electric potential , and osmotic gradients , which we can predict with our model . To begin with , we will remove the coupling between mechanics and chemistry ; this coupling will be added later to examine the altered dynamics . 4 Frontal polarization of NHE plays critical roles in confined migration of human breast cancer and murine sarcoma cancer cells [ 14 – 16 ] . We use NHE as the first example to illustrate how ion carrier polarization leads to intracellular gradients . We vary the NHE polarization ratio from α fNHE / α bNHE = 1 , meaning non - polarized , to α fNHE , F / α bNHE , F = 3 , meaning a three - folds polarization to the cell front . In human breast cancer cells , 2 . 3 folds of front NHE polarization was observed [ 15 ] . Our model predicts that as the frontal polarization ratio of NHE increases , the intracellular ionic gradients increase ( Fig . 2A ) . Higher pH is developed at the cell front than the cell back because NHE continuously removes hydrogen ions at the front . High pH leads to high bicarbonate concentration due to the bicarbonate - carbonic acid pair reaction . As a result , the spatial distributions of pH and bicarbonate concentration mirror each other . In addition , the frontal polarization of NHE brings in sodium at the cell front . Since NHE is electro - neutral , its polarization does not generate a significant intracellular electric potential gradient . Nor does it generate an intracellular cytosol pressure gradient or significantly modify the F - actin velocity and concentration ( Fig . S1A ) . The combined gradients of all ion species generate an elevated osmolarity at the cell front ( Fig . 2A ) , which drives water influx at the cell front ( Fig . 2B ) . With contributions from water - driven cell migration , the cell velocity increases with NHE polarization as the water flux increases . This NHE - driven water influx is consistent with our understanding that high NHE expression level leads to cell swelling and water flow [ 21 , 26 , 34 ] . This water flux is predicted to drive G - actin towards the back of the cell , leading to a higher G - actin concentration at the cell back than the front ( Fig . 2A ) . In summary , on the side where the NHE expression level is high , the overall osmolarity is also high but is less acidic . Water flows from the high NHE side to the low side . Not all ion carriers are equally effective in generating intracellular ion gradients . Our model predicts that the polarization of NHE , AE2 , or the passive chloride channel can modulate the pH gradient , but not other ion carriers ( Fig . 2C , ∆pH ) . NHE and AE2 involve hydrogen and bicarbonate ions , respectively , and thus directly impact pH . The passive chloride channel affects chloride concentra - tion , which interacts with AE2 , thus indirectly affecting pH . Frontal polarization of NHE increases the pH value at the front , whereas AE2 and the passive potassium channel decrease it ( Fig . 2C , pH f ) . However , due to their electro - neutrality , NHE and AE2 are inefficient in modulating the intracellular electric potential ( Fig . 2C , ϕ f and ∆ ϕ ) . In contrast , the polarization of the passive potassium and chloride channels can affect the electric field significantly because of their high flux and electrogenic nature . Our model predicts that ion carriers that are effective in generating pH or electric potential gradients are also effective in generating water flux ( Fig . 2C , J water ) . Frontal polarization of NHE and AE2 leads to water influx at the front ( and thus efflux at the back ) . In contrast , the frontal polarization of the passive potassium and chloride channels leads to water efflux at the front ( and thus influx at the back ) . This model prediction is consistent with experimental observations : frontal polarization of NHE1 and back polarization of SWELL1 , a type of passive chloride channel , collectively drive cell migration [ 15 ] . AE2 and the passive chloride channel generate intracellular pH gradients along their direction of polarization but create water flux in the opposite direction . The polarization of NKE , one of the essential ion carriers in maintaining physiological functions , seems to have little effect on intracellular pH and electric potential compared to other ion carriers ( Fig . 2C ) . This does not mean that NKE does not matter . The model predicts that NKE polariza - tion ratio needs to be significantly larger to see differences in the pH gradient , electric potential , and water flux ( Fig . S1B ) . When NKE is highly polarized to the back , water flows out of the cell at the back . This directional water flux has also been demonstrated in experiments where kidney cells pump water from the apical to the basal side [ 11 ] . 5 ( A ) polariza � on to the front polariza � on to the back ra � o > 1 ra � o < 1 ( B ) ( C ) Figure 2 : Model predictions on the effect of polarized ion carriers without coupling between me - chanics and biochemistry .

A ratio equal to 1 means the ion carriers are not polarized . Each ion carrier is varied independently , while the other carriers remain non - polarized . 6 3 . 2 Extracellular pH polarization leads to intracellular pH gradient via AE2 Extracellular pH gradients can occur in vivo in multiple scenarios , such as from solute gradients generated by neighboring cells , fluid circulation in organs , the tumor microenvironment , or during immune response [ 35 ] . At the same time , cells migrating in this environment may have polarized ion carriers . We investigate how extracellular pH gradients interact with polarized ion carriers during migration . In the model , we increase the extracellular pH at the front of the cell , pH f0 , while keeping the pH at the back , pH b0 , fixed at 7 . 42 . The increase of pH f0 is obtained by increasing the extracellular bicarbonate concentration at the front . In cells without ion carrier polarization , the intracellular pH gradient follows the extracellular one ( Fig . 3A ) . This is because increased extracellular bicarbonate concentration at the front leads to less bicarbonate efflux through AE2 , and thus increases intracellular bicarbonate concentration at the cell front ( Fig . 3A ) . For this reason , we hypothesize that AE2 is the first responder to the extracellular pH change , and other ion carriers follow the AE2 change instead of following the extracellular cues . We will test this hypothesis later . Cells have abilities to cushion environmental stress , so the intracellular pH gradient is much smaller than the extracellular one , as predicted by the model . The pH gradient has little effect on the intracellular electric potential ( Fig . S2 ) . The spatial gradient of the bicarbonate concentration mirrors that of pH ( Fig . 3A ) , as we have seen in the last section ( Fig . 2A ) . Although a frontal polarization of NHE and an extracellular pH increase at the front generate same intracellular pH and bicarbonate gradients , the other ionic concentration fields are different between these two scenarios ( Figs . 3A and 2A ) . In addition , with increased extracellular pH at the cell front , the model predicts water efflux at the front ( Fig . 3B ) , as opposed to influx with NHE polarization ( Fig . 2B ) . These phenomena suggest that the intracellular pH gradient alone does not determine the distribution of ions and the direction of water flux . We thus expect that the combination of extracellular pH and NHE polarizations generate inter - esting patterns . Indeed , the model predicts that increasing extracellular pH at the cell front while polarizing NHE towards the back cancels the intracellular pH gradient , but polarizing NHE towards the cell front enhances the positive intracellular pH gradient brought by the high front extracellular pH ( Fig . 3C ) . The water flux follows an opposite pattern such that a frontal polarization of NHE cancels the water flux generated by front extracellular pH increase . Likewise , the combination of an extracellular pH gradient with the polarization of the passive chloride channel ( Fig . 3D ) or AE2 ( Fig . 3E ) has different effects on generating intracellular pH gradient and water flux . Cells in general can have multiple ion carriers polarized at the same time . Since ion fluxes are additive , the effects from these polarizations are also additive . For example , a frontal polarization of NHE and a back polarization of the passive chloride channels mutually increase water influx at the cell front , whereas frontal polarization of both NHE and the passive chloride channels results in no water flux or even water efflux at the cell front [ 15 ] . To test our hypothesis that AE2 is the carrier that responds to the extracellular pH change , we vary the AE2 permeability at the cell front while keeping it unchanged at the back and observe the cell responses in the absence of extracellular pH polarization . The model indeed predicts that a decrease of AE2 permeability at the cell front produces the same intracellular gradients of all field variables as the case of increasing the extracellular pH at the cell front ( compare Fig . S3 with Fig . S2 ) . No other ion carriers are able to achieve this . Therefore , from the cell homeostasis regulation perspective , a higher extracellular pH at the cell front ( without regulating AE2 activities ) is equivalent to reducing AE2 activity at the cell front ( without polarizing the extracellular pH ) . 7 ( A ) ( C ) ( B ) ( D ) ( E ) Figure 3 : Model prediction where there is an extracellular pH increase ( more alkaline ) at the cell front while the pH at the back is fixed . Extracellular pH change is obtained by changing the concentration of extracellular bicarbonate . Before polarization , pH f0 = pH b0 = 7 . 42 . After polarization , pH f0 > 7 . 42 and the value varies . No coupling between mechanics and chemistry .

( B ) Water flux at the cell front as a function of extracellular pH at the cell front . ( C ) - ( E ) The intracellular pH difference ( defined as the pH at the cell front minus the back ) and water flux at the cell front as functions of ion carrier polarization ( NHE in panel C , passive chloride channel in panel D , and AE2 in panel E ) and extracellular pH at the cell front . 8 3 . 3 Extracellular electrical potential gradients leads to intracellular gradients via passive potassium channels We next study the effect of extracellular electric potential gradients by increasing the front potential , ϕ f0 , from 0 to 30 mV while keeping ϕ b0 = 0 at the back . In cells without ion carrier polarization , the intracellular electric potential gradient is predicted to follow the extracellular one ( Fig . 4A ) but its gradient is smaller . The electric potential gradient has little effect on pH ( Fig . S4 ) . A positive extracellular electric potential at the front leads to reduced potassium efflux from the passive potassium channel , generating a relatively high intracellular potassium concentration at the cell front ( Fig . 4A ) . Fluxes through other ion carriers adjust as well , creating intracellular gradients for all ions . However , the gradients of ion concentrations from external electric potential gradients are smaller than those from the pH gradient ( compare Figs . 4A and 3A ) , although the magnitude of water fluxes from the two cases are comparable ( Figs . 4B and 3B ) . The passive chloride and potassium channels are the only two ion carriers whose polarization is able to generate intracellular non - trivial electric potential gradient ( Fig . 2C ) . When these two channels are polarized in the presence of an extracellular electric potential gradient , various patterns of potential gradients and water flux occur ( Fig . 4C , D ) . For example , a frontal polarization of the chloride channel increases the intracellular electric potential generated by the extracellular potential but reduces or even reverses the water flux . Our model suggests that cells in vivo may develop ion carrier polarization to enhance or counter - act environmental electrical signals . Since passive chloride channels generate an intracellular pH gradient ( Fig . 2C ) , but there is almost no intracellular pH gradient under extracellular electric potential polarization ( Fig . S4 ) , we thus hypothesize that the passive potassium channel is the agent that responds to the extracellular elec - tric potential signal . We test this hypothesis by varying the permeability of the passive potassium channel at the cell front in the absence of extracellular electric potential polarization . The model predicts that reducing front potassium channel activities is equivalent to increasing the extracellular front electric potential ( compare Fig . S5 with Fig . S4 ) . All spatial fields have the same directions of gradients , and the water fluxes follow the same direction under these two cases . No other ion carriers can achieve this correspondence . 3 . 4 pH - triggered actin depolymerization can modulate F - actin distribution In the above discussion , we used a decoupled model between actin and pH ( γ = γ 0 = const . and γ pH = 0 in Eq . 1 ) to analyze how each ion carrier impacts cell homeostasis . In this section , we will study the effect of pH - dependent actin depolymerization on the F - actin distribution . Recall that polarization of extracellular pH leads to membrane water flux ( Fig . 3B ) . Water flux generates cytosol flow , which impacts actin distribution in two ways . The first effect comes from the convection of G - actin by the cytosol flow . When the cytosol flows from the back to the front of the cell , which happens when pH f0 > pH b0 , it carries G - actin and polarizes it towards the front ( Fig . 5A ) . When the opposite occurs , G - actin polarizes to the back ( Fig . 5B ) . The second effect is on F - actin concentration influenced by G - actin . In the simplest case with no environment or ion carrier polarization , F - actin always concentrates at the cell front where actin polymerization occurs ( Fig . S1A ) . This frontal F - actin polarization can be critical in actin - driven cell migration [ 25 , 28 , 36 ] . However , when G - actin polarizes towards the back , which occurs when cytosol flows from the front to the back , F - actin can redistribute ( Fig . 5B ) . 9 ( A ) ( B ) ( C ) ( D ) Figure 4 : Model predictions on the effect of extracellular electric potential increase at the cell front while the potential at the back is fixed .

( D ) Fluxes through ion carriers in a non - polarized environment as functions of a constant rate of actin depolymerization for different choices of NHE permeability . 11 The F - actin distribution can revert when the rate of actin depolymerization , γ , increases with pH by cofilin [ 31 , 32 ] . Since the intracellular pH gradient follows the extracellular one , so does the actin depolymerization rate . When pH f0 > pH b0 , a higher rate of actin depolymerization at the cell front does not change the polarity of F - actin ( Fig . 5A ) . When pH f0 < pH b0 , the higher rate of actin depolymerization at the cell back disassembles F - actin , leading to a frontal polarization of the cell ( Fig . 5B ) similar to that in the control case ( Fig . S1 ) . The model suggests that pH can modulate F - actin distribution through pH - induced cytosol flow , pH - dependent actin depolymerizatoin , or both . Since actin distribution is critical to cell motility , modulating intracellular dynamics , and force distribution , the coupling between pH and actin can be one of the mechanisms to ensure proper cell function when there is environmental pH shocks . 3 . 5 Actin - generated NHE polarization generates biphasic water flux and intra - cellular pH gradient We have so far prescribed ion carriers’ polarization by setting their front - to - back polarization ratios as parameters . In this section , we consider the case where NHE polarization is determined by F - actin [ 16 , 21 ] , i . e . , α NHE = α NHE ( θ n ) ( Eq . 2 ) , instead of being prescribed . In order to focus on the effect of actin - induced NHE polarization , we let γ = γ 0 = const . , and the other ion carriers and the extracellular environment are non - polarized . Without actin - induced NHE polarization , there is no water flux nor intracellular ionic gradients regardless of the rate of actin depolymerization , γ , in a non - polarized cell ( Fig . 5C and D ) . The cell velocity is a biphasic function of γ because of an actin - flow to actin - distribution transition [ 28 ] . The rate of actin depolymerization , γ , reduces the average F - actin concentration across the cell and establishes a high F - actin polarization ratio , i . e . , θ f n / θ b n increases with γ [ 28 ] . After implementing actin - induced NHE polarization where the permeabilities α fNHE and α bNHE follow θ f n and θ b n , NHE polarizes towards the cell front as the rate of actin depolymerization , γ , increases . The model predicts a biphasic water flux as a function of actin depolymerization rate , γ ( Fig . 5C ) . The rising phase in the water flux comes from the increasing ratio of NHE polarization as γ increases . The decreasing phase is due to reduced NHE flux as F - actin concentration drops . In this case , even if the NHE polarization ratio is very large , the low NHE flux cannot establish a large osmotic gradient . Biphasic water flux contributes to biphasic cell velocity ( Fig . 5C ) . The three ion carriers that involve sodium ions , NHE , NKE , and the passive sodium channel , also show biphasic fluxes as γ increases . Ion carriers that do not involve sodium are monotonic in γ , except for AE2 , where a small bump appears due to its linkage to pH ( Fig . 5D ) . With the actin - NHE coupling , our model indicates that F - actin alone can generate water flux and ion dynamics without prescribing polarization for other membrane ion carriers . This result is surprising and suggest that the actin - NHE interaction is the central element in establishing cell movement . The gradients of intracellular pH and electric potential also show biphasic relations with the rate of actin depolymerization ( Fig . 5C , ∆pH and ∆ ϕ ) but not the baseline pH and electric potential values ( Fig . 5C , pH f and ϕ f ) . This difference suggests that pH and electric potential gradients are influenced by both the NHE polarization ratio and absolute permeability . In contrast , pH and electric potential values are only affected by NHE absolute flux . The decreasing pH with increasing γ indicates that cells will not further elevate actin depolymerization through pH - γ coupling . 12 4 Conclusions In this work , we used a theoretical model to study the impact of ion carriers and extracellular environment gradients on cell ion homeostasis , migration , and actin network distribution . Each ion carrier plays a specific role in maintaining cell homeostasis by communicating information between the inside and the outside . Some ion carriers modulate pH , some modulate electric potential , and some do both . The model predicts that pH and electric potential are uncoupled , suggesting that cells can maintain homeostasis of one field when the other field is perturbed . Our results show that , within the ion carriers included in this work , extracellular pH gradients lead to intracellular pH gradient via chloride - bicarbonate exchangers , whereas extracellular electric potential polarization leads to intracellular electric potential gradient via passive potassium channels . The magnitudes of intracellular gradients are smaller than the extracellular ones , indicating that cells can cushion environmental changes through negative feedback . Cells develop intracellular pH , electric potential , and ion concentration gradients when membrane ion carriers are polarized . The magnitudes of these gradients depend on the ratio of carrier polar - ization . The types of membrane ion carriers also play a major role in determining the gradients . Given the same polarization ratio , NHE , AE2 , and the passive chloride and potassium channels are more effective in creating intracellular biochemical gradients than NKE and the passive sodium channel . When ion carrier polarization is coupled with extracellular polarization , various combi - nations of intracellular electric potential gradient , pH gradient , and water flux can occur . It is possible to create an intracellular gradient without generating water flux , or generate water flux without creating an intracellular gradient . When extracellular hydraulic resistance is high , water flux will increase the cell migrations speed . The coupling between the actin network and ion carriers introduces more complexity and increases the diversity of behaviors we observe . Our model predicts that the polarization of F - actin con - centration can change when an intracellular pH gradient develops . The distribution of F - actin is related to many intracellular processes , such as force distribution , morphology , nucleus anchoring , nuclear envelope stress , and intracellular trafficking . In addition to the known impact of pH on cell biochemistry , the model suggests that pH also has the potential to indirectly affect cell dynamics through a redistribution of the actin network . The structural linkage between F - actin and NHE through ezrin suggests that the polarization of F - actin establishes NHE polarization . The polarization of F - actin comes from actin polymerization , and the polarization of NHE leads to water flux . As a result , actin - driven cell migration and water - driven cell migration are intrinsically coupled together . In two - dimensional cell migration , where water - driven cell migration is not applicable due to the low extracellular hydraulic resistance , we can still expect intracellular cytosol flow generated by transmembrane water flux . Such cytosol flow has the potential to provide effective convection for intracellular signaling molecules . Moreover , our model predicts that F - actin alone can generate water flux through NHE , even when other membrane ion carriers are not polarized . This result is surprising and suggest that the actin - NHE interaction is the central element in establishing cell movement . To summarize , our model predicts that membrane ion carriers and environmental polarizations can generate intracellular osmotic , electric potential , pH , and actin gradients , which have implications on intracellular dynamics and signaling . The coupling between biochemistry and mechanics further increases the cells’ adaptability to internal or external perturbations . The future development of understanding on cell biology requires integrated views of biochemical and physical processes . 13 Acknowledgment Yizeng Li is supported by NSF 2303648 .
