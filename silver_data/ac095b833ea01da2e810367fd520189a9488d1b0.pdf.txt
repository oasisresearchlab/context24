ALK - rearranged NSCLC are typically adenocarcinoma characterized by a solid signet - ring cell pattern that is frequently associated with a metastatic phenotype . Recent reports linked the presence of ALK rearrangement to an epithelial - mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) phenotype in NSCLC , but the extent and the mechanisms of an ALK - mediated EMT in ALK - rearranged NSCLC are largely unknown . We found that the ALK - rearranged H2228 and DFCI032 , but not the H3122 , cell lines displayed a mesenchymal phenotype . In these cell lines , oncogenic ALK activity dictated an EMT phenotype by directly suppressing E - cadherin and up - regulating vimentin expression , as well as expression of other genes involved in EMT . We found that the epithelial splicing regulatory protein 1 ( ESRP1 ) , a key regulator of the splicing switch during EMT , was repressed by EML4 - ALK activity . The treatment of NSCLC cells with ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) led to up - regulation of ESRP1 and E - cadherin , thus reverting the phenotype from mesenchymal to epithelial ( MET ) . Consistently , ESRP1 knock - down impaired E - cadherin up - regulation upon ALK inhibition , whereas enforced expression of ESRP1 was sufficient to increase E - cadherin expression . These findings demonstrate an ALK oncogenic activity in the regulation of an EMT phenotype in a subset of NSCLC with potential implications for the biology of ALK - rearranged NSCLC in terms of metastatic propensity and resistance to therapy . INTRODUCTION Approximately 5 - 6 % of NSCLC cases harbor chromosomal rearrangements involving the Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase ( ALK ) gene that produce fusion proteins with constitutive ALK kinase activity [ 1 , 2 ] . The most frequent is the chromosomal inversion within chromosome 2 that generates EML4 - ALK chimeric protein , but additional ALK translocations with different partners have been described [ 3 – 5 ] . ALK - rearranged NSCLC is typically an adenocarcinoma that exhibits unique histological features represented by solid tumor growth and frequent signet - ring cells with abundant intracellular mucin [ 2 , 6 – 10 ] . In lung cancers , as well as other epithelial cancers , the signet ring morphology is frequently associated with a more aggressive and metastatic phenotype [ 11 – 14 ] . Interestingly , in NSCLC some studies reported a strong association of ALK rearrangements with advanced disease stage at diagnosis and metastasis [ 8 , 10 ] . In addition , when compared to Oncotarget 33317 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget other NSCLC , ALK - rearranged NSCLC is frequently associated with an epithelial - mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) phenotype as determined by loss of E - cadherin and increased vimentin expression [ 9 ] . The EMT is a fundamental program activated during embryogenesis and development that converts a polarized - epithelial cell into a mesenchymal cell with higher motility capacity and elevated resistance to apoptosis [ 15 – 17 ] . In epithelial tumors , EMT is a crucial process for the dissemination of cancer cells and it has been related to progression and metastasis , and a mesenchymal - like phenotype is frequently observed in aggressive tumors [ 15 , 16 , 18 – 20 ] . In cancer cells , EMT is usually characterized by the suppression of epithelial markers , such as E - cadherin , and expression of mesenchymal markers , such as vimentin and N - cadherin through a complex transcriptional reprogramming [ 21 – 23 ] . EMT phenotype is also thought to be associated with resistance to targeted therapy in EGFR - driven NSCLC [ 24 , 25 ] and in ALK - rearranged NSCLC treated with ALK TKIs [ 26 ] as well as in K - Ras mutated cancers [ 27 ] . Moreover , recent reports demonstrated that EMT was dispensable for metastasis but contributed to chemoresistance in two different mouse models [ 28 , 29 ] . In this study we found that 2 out of the 3 most commonly used ALK - rearranged NSCLC cell lines show an EMT phenotype based on E - cadherin and vimentin expression . In these two cell lines , the inhibition of ALK kinase activity with ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) or the knock - down of EML4 - ALK by shRNA , reverted the mesenchymal - like phenotype leading to up - regulation of E - cadherin and down - regulation of vimentin , so - called mesenchymal to epithelial transition ( MET ) [ 21 ] . EML4 - ALK repressed the epithelial splicing regulatory protein 1 and 2 ( ESRP1 and ESRP2 ) , key regulators of a splicing switch during EMT . Overexpression of ESRP1 in these ALK - rearranged NSCLC cell lines lead to up - regulation of E - cadherin . Consistently , ESRP1 knock - down impaired the reversion to an epithelial phenotype associated to inhibition of ALK activity . Thus , in ALK - rearranged NSCLC , the EMT phenotype depends on the ALK activity via ESRP repression . RESULTS EMT markers are enriched in ALK - rearranged NSCLC Early reports suggest a possible role of ALK in inducing an EMT phenotype in ALK - negative lung cancer cells [ 30 ] . However , the real contribution of the ALK oncogene to an EMT phenotype has not been investigated in ALK - rearranged NSCLC . To determine the association of an EMT phenotype with the presence of ALK rearrangements in NSCLC , we analyzed data sets of primary ALK - rearranged NSCLC as well as ALK - rearranged human cell lines for EMT signatures and the EMT markers E - cadherin , vimentin and N - cadherin . We identified 16 ALK - rearranged NSCLC cases from publicly available datasets ( TCGA and GEO dataset GSE31210 ) [ 31 , 32 ] and compared them to 29 normal samples [ 33 ] . The list of genes differentially expressed between ALK - rearranged tumors and adjacent normal samples was tested for enrichment with respect to the EMT signatures in the MSigDB repository [ 34 ] . Gene Set Enrichment Analysis ( GSEA ) [ 35 ] yielded a statistically significant enrichment of the activated EMT signatures in ALK - rearranged NSCLC compared to control samples ( Figure 1A ) . Concordantly , hierarchical clustering of the 45 samples projected onto the “ALONSO _ METASTASIS _ UP” signature yielded a clear segregation into ALK - rearranged tumors and normal samples ( Figure 1B ) [ 36 ] Next , we examined the expression levels of the EMT markers , E - cadherin , vimentin and N - cadherin , in commonly available human NSCLC cell lines derived from different genotypes . ALK - rearranged NSCLC cell lines showed variable expression of EMT markers in two cells lines ( H2228 and DFCI032 ) , whereas a third commonly used cell line ( H3122 ) was more epithelial . By Western Blot assay , H2228 and DFCI032 expressed high vimentin and little or no E - cadherin , whereas H3122 expressed only E - cadherin . DFCI032 also strongly expressed N - cadherin ( Figure 1C ) . Consistently , H3122 displayed a classic epithelial morphology with expression of E - cadherin on the cell membrane , whereas H2228 and DFCI032 exhibited a mesenchymal phenotype with strong vimentin expression in the cytoplasm and almost undetectable E - cadherin ( Figure 1D ) . NSCLC cell lines with other driver mutations ( K - Ras , EGFR and B - Raf mutations ) similarly showed variable expression of EMT markers ( Figure 1C ) . Thus , heterogeneity of EMT phenotype was observed in ALK - rearranged NSCLC , consistent with the notion that a range of EMT marker expression is commonly observed within NSCLC [ 24 , 27 , 37 ] . ALK oncogenic activity regulates EMT in ALK - rearranged NSCLC We next investigated in detail whether EML4 - ALK activity was directly controlling the EMT phenotype in those ALK - rearranged NSCLC with a mesenchymal phenotype . To this end , we focused our experiments on the H2228 and DFCI032 cell lines that showed an EMT phenotype ( Figure 1C ) . We first performed an RNA sequencing ( RNA - Seq ) analysis on H2228 cells treated with the ALK TKI TAE - 684 for 24 hours . We used Cuffdiff to identify differentially expressed genes at an FDR q - value ≤ 0 . 05 and found 910 genes whose expression decreased ( ALK up - regulated genes ) and 678 genes whose expression increased ( ALK down - regulated genes ) upon ALK inhibition ( Supplementary Table 1 ) Oncotarget 33318 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget [ 38 ] . These sets of up - and down - regulated genes were then tested for enrichment against EMT gene sets derived from in vitro experiments and included in the MSigDB c2 CGP gene set compendium . We found that ALK activated or repressed genes significantly correlated with an EMT phenotype ( Figure 2A ) , thus suggesting that ALK activity might directly regulate an EMT phenotype in ALK - rearranged NSCLC . Next , we performed an RT 2 Profiler PCR array containing 83 EMT - related genes on H2228 cells treated with two different ALK TKIs ( TAE - 684 and crizotinib ) or where EML4 - ALK was knocked - down by a specific shRNA ( Supplementary Table 2 ) . To exclude genes modulated by off - target activity of the TKI or the shRNA approach , we considered only genes that were consistently regulated in all the three different conditions . Upon ALK inhibition PTP4A1 ( also known as PRL - 1 ) , SerpinE1 and CTNNB1 , all genes that are associated with a mesenchymal or invasive phenotype [ 39 – 41 ] , were strongly down - regulated . In contrast , E - cadherin ( CDH1 ) , occludin ( OCLN ) and keratin14 ( KRT14 ) [ 21 , 22 , 42 ] , all genes typically associated with an epithelial morphology , were markedly up - regulated ( Figure 2B ) . We validated some of the genes found in these screenings by quantitative RT - PCR ( qRT - PCR ) in both H2228 and DFCI032 cell lines . mRNA levels of PRL - 1 Figure 1 : ALK - rearranged NSCLC are enriched in EMT markers .

Oncotarget 33319 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget and SerpinE1 showed significant changes in expression upon ALK inhibition in both cell lines ( Figure 3A - 3B ) , confirming the screening results . In keeping with the mRNA data , the protein expression levels of PRL - 1 decreased and were dependent on ALK kinase activity ( Figure 3C ) . Interestingly , one of the genes identified in the screening with the RT 2 Profiler PCR array was ERBB3 that was strongly up - regulated after ALK inhibition both as mRNA ( Figure 2B ) and protein ( Supplementary Figure 1A ) , consistent with our previous findings [ 43 ] . Based on these screenings , classical transcriptional regulators of EMT [ 21 , 22 ] , such as Snail , Twist or Zeb families , did not show any significant changes at the mRNA level ( Figure 2B ) . Western blot analysis revealed down - regulation of Zeb1 protein in both cell lines , and Snail protein only in H2228 after treatment with ALK TKIs ( Figure 3D ) , suggesting a post - transcriptional control of these transcription factors by oncogenic ALK . Some EMT regulators have been previously associated with ALK oncogenic activity [ 30 ] , therefore we further Figure 2 : ALK oncogenic activity regulates EMT in ALK - rearranged NSCLC . A .

Oncotarget 33321 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget extended our analysis to other EMT - related genes that were not included in the array . We found that ALK regulated the expression of ESRP1 and ESRP2 , key regulators of a splicing switch during EMT [ 44 , 45 ] . Interestingly , both ESRP1 and 2 were repressed in H2228 and DFCI032 cell lines and upon ALK inhibition their mRNA levels increased significantly ( Figure 3E - 3F and Supplementary Figure 1B - 1C ) . Consistently , protein levels of ESRP1 were up - regulated by ALK inhibition ( Figure 3G and Supplementary 1D ) . Up - regulation of ESRP1 mRNA and protein was also observed in H2228 cells transduced with shALK , thus excluding off - target effects of ALK TKIs on ESRP1 regulation ( Supplementary Figure E - F ) , Concomitantly , both E - cadherin and vimentin were up - and down - regulated , respectively ( Figure 3G and Supplementary Figure D - F ) . In vivo treatment with TAE - 684 resulted in an increased staining for ESRP1 in s . c . xenografts of H2228 ( Supplementary Figure 2A ) . Interestingly , in a human sample of our collection where we had ALK - rearranged NSCLC and adjacent normal lung , we detected lower staining of ESRP1 protein in tumor cells than in the adjacent normal epithelial cells ( Supplementary Figure 2B ) . Taken together these results suggest that oncogenic EML4 - ALK activity orchestrates a transcriptional and post - transcriptional program to sustain the EMT phenotype in ALK - rearranged NSCLC . EML4 - ALK regulates E - cadherin and vimentin in ALK - rearranged NSCLC Next , we determined to what extent the ALK oncogenic activity controlled the expression of EMT markers , E - cadherin and vimentin , in ALK - rearranged NSCLC . Based on the RNA - Seq results and the RT 2 Profiler PCR array , EML4 - ALK regulated only E - cadherin at transcriptional level , whereas mRNA levels of vimentin did not change upon ALK inhibition ( Figure 2B ) . Thus , we performed a qRT - PCR analysis to study the mRNA levels of E - cadherin and vimentin in H2228 and DFCI032 treated with ALK TKIs . Upon treatment , E - cadherin mRNA levels significantly increased in both cell lines confirming that E - cadherin was transcriptionally regulated by ALK activity ( Figure 4A ) . In contrast , no significant changes of vimentin mRNA levels in either cell line were detected , in keeping with the array data ( Figure 4B ) . These data are also in accordance with Guo et al . that showed no changes in vimentin mRNA upon EML4 - ALK ectopic expression in H1299 NSCLC cancer cell line [ 30 ] . Protein levels of E - cadherin and vimentin markedly changed when EML4 - ALK was inhibited by TKIs in both H2228 and DFCI032 ( Figure 4C ) . In particular , ALK inhibition led to up - regulation of E - cadherin and down - regulation of vimentin , thus reverting the phenotype from mesenchymal to epithelial in both cell lines ( so called mesenchymal - to - epithelial transition , MET ) . We also treated the other ALK - rearranged NSCLC cell line characterized by an epithelial phenotype ( H3122 ) to check whether the EMT markers , E - cadherin and vimentin , changed upon ALK inhibition and found that the level of E - cadherin expression remained stable and vimentin still undetectable for the whole period of inhibition with TKIs ( Supplementary 3A ) , thus indicating that in this cell line ALK activity was not regulating an EMT phenotype . The effects of ALK TKIs were linked to a specific inhibition of ALK activity and not to off - target effects for the following reasons : 1 ) we observed similar effects with two unrelated ALK TKIs ( Figure 4C ) ; 2 ) ALK TKIs did not modulate EMT markers in NSCLC cell lines driven by different oncogenic mutations , such as K - Ras or EGFR mutations ( Supplementary Figure 3B - 3C ) ; and 3 ) genetic knock - down of EML4 - ALK closely phenocopied the effect of ALK TKIs on E - cadherin and vimentin mRNA ( Supplementary Figure 4A - 4B ) and protein levels ( Supplementary Figure 4C ) . EMT regulation by oncogenic ALK was also consistently observed in vivo in s . c . xenografts of H2228 treated with an ALK TKI ( Figure 4D ) . Overall , these data showed that in vitro and in vivo the EMT phenotype in ALK - rearranged NSCLC is directly sustained by the oncogenic activity of ALK . During cancer progression the activation of an EMT program , and thus the acquisition of a mesenchymal phenotype , is correlated to increased migratory and invasive properties of cancer cells or to chemoresistance [ 15 , 16 , 28 , 29 ] . The reversion of the mesenchymal phenotype by ALK inhibition impaired the migratory and invasive abilities of DFCI032 cell line ( Supplementary Figure 5A - 5B ) . In contrast , in H2228 cells treatment with TAE - 684 increased cell migration and invasion , suggesting the activation of compensatory pathways to sustain or even increase this phenotype ( Supplementary Figure 5A - 5B ) . We and others previously demonstrated that the EGFR family members can induce resistance to ALK TKIs by activating by - pass compensatory signaling pathways in ALK - rearranged NSCLC [ 43 , 46 , 47 ] and are associated to EMT in different tumors types [ 48 , 49 ] . Since we observed an up - regulation of both mRNA and protein levels of ERBB3 in TAE - 684 - inhibited H2228 cells ( Figure 2B and Supplementary Figure 1A ) , we hypothesized an involvement of ERBB receptors in TAE - 684 induced increased migration in H2228 cells . Indeed , treatment with lapatinib , a dual inhibitor of EGFR and ERBB receptors [ 50 , 51 ] , blocked the increased cell migration and invasion induced by TAE - 684 ( Supplementary Figure 5A - 5B ) . We then further investigated the contribution of the EGFR family members to the EMT phenotype in ALK - rearranged NSCLC . To block EGFR signaling , we treated H2228 and DFCI032 with lapatinib , alone or in combination with ALK TKIs ( TAE - 684 or crizotinib ) . Lapatinib completely abrogated EGFR and ERBB2 signaling as detected by specific phospho - antibodies in both cell lines , but it did not affect E - cadherin or vimentin expression in contrast to ALK TKIs ( Supplementary Figure 6A - 6B ) . Thus , Oncotarget 33322 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget Figure 4 : ALK oncogenic activity sustains the mesenchymal phenotype in ALK - rearranged NSCLC . A - B .

Oncotarget 33323 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget despite possible compensatory effects on the migratory and invasive abilities of ALK - rearranged cell lines , we concluded that EGFR and ERBB2 signaling did not significantly contribute to the EMT phenotype in ALK - rearranged NSCLC . EML4 - ALK ectopic expression in immortalized lung epithelial cells induces a mesenchymal phenotype Next , we asked whether EML4 - ALK would promote an EMT phenotype also in non - tumoral lung cells . We stably transduced immortalized bronchial epithelial cells ( BEAS - 2B cells ) with retroviruses expressing EML4 - ALK or the kinase dead mutant K589R , EML4 - ALK KD , as a control ( Supplementary Figure 7A - 7B ) . We observed dramatic morphological changes in BEAS - 2B cells expressing EML4 - ALK using light microscopy as the typically round - epithelial shape turned into an elongated spindle - shaped morphology in cells expressing EML4 - ALK ( Figure 5A , left and central panels ) consistent with the acquisition of a mesenchymal - like morphology . Cells transduced with the kinase dead retained their epithelial morphology ( Figure 5A , right panels ) . The percentage of spindle - shaped cells was significantly higher in cells expressing EML4 - ALK compared to EML4 - ALK KD cells ( Figure 5B ) . By immunofluorescence staining we found that enforced expression of EML4 - ALK induced decreased E - cadherin and increased vimentin expression in GFP - reporter positive cells ( Figure 5C - 5D ) . In control cells transduced with EML4 - ALK KD both E - cadherin and vimentin expression and localization remained unaffected ( Figure 5C - 5D ) . Consistently , protein levels of E - cadherin and vimentin changed in presence of active EML4 - ALK ( Figure 5E ) , whereas only E - cadherin mRNA was regulated by EML - ALK in accordance with our findings in ALK - rearranged NSCLC cells ( Figure 5F ) . Taken together , these findings demonstrate that oncogenic EML4 - ALK not only maintains an EMT phenotype in NSCLC cells , but also induces a similar phenotype in normal epithelial lung cells . EML4 - ALK regulates E - cadherin through repression of the epithelial splicing regulatory proteins 1 ( ESRP1 ) Finally , we investigated in more detail the mechanisms by which oncogenic ALK orchestrates the EMT phenotype in NSCLC . Our attention was caught by ESRP1 as it is considered to be a regulator of EMT by inducing a complex alternative splicing program [ 44 ] . ESRP1 induces E - cadherin expression and low levels of ESRP1 are typically associated with a mesenchymal phenotype in cancer cells [ 45 , 52 ] . Therefore , because we showed that oncogenic ALK repressed the expression of ESRP1 in NSCLC ( Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure 1B - 1F and 2 ) , we first confirmed that also in BEAS - 2B cells the forced expression of EML4 - ALK reduced ESRP1 levels , both mRNA and protein , in contrast to EML4 - ALK KD ( Figure 5E and 5G ) , thus indicating that oncogenic ALK represses ESRP1 expression both in cancer and normal lung epithelial cells . Next we asked whether repression of ESRP1 is necessary for the maintenance of the EMT phenotype in ALK - rearranged cells . To test this hypothesis , we overexpressed ESRP1 in H2228 and DFCI032 cells . Enforced expression of ESRP1 alone produced a partial inversion of the EMT phenotype as it induced in both cell lines a marked expression of E - cadherin , but did not affect expression of vimentin ( Figure 6A ) . Finally , in a reverse experiment , we asked whether ESRP1 up - regulation was required for the epithelial transition observed during ALK TKI treatment of NSCLC cells . To test this , we knocked - down ESRP1 by specific shRNA during crizotinib treatment and observed an attenuated E - cadherin induction compared to control shRNA in both cell lines ( Figure 6B ) . Overall , these findings indicate that ESRP1 is a key regulator of the EMT phenotype induced by oncogenic ALK in normal and cancer lung epithelial cells . DISCUSSION In the present study we show that the presence of ALK rearrangements correlated overall with an EMT molecular signature in NSCLC and that 2 out of 3 ALK - rearranged NSCLC cell lines displayed a mesenchymal phenotype , defined by the combined loss of epithelial markers , such as E - cadherin , and gain of mesenchymal markers , such as vimentin and N - cadherin . Importantly , we demonstrated that in those NSCLC with an EMT phenotype , EML4 - ALK activity was necessary to sustain the phenotype by directly regulating the expression of proteins involved in EMT . The association we found between EMT molecular signatures and ALK rearrangements in NSCLC is consistent with the frequent observation of the loss of E - cadherin associated with vimentin expression in ALK - rearranged lung cancer compared with other NSCLC genotypes [ 9 ] . In NSCLC driven by other oncogenes , such as EGFR or K - Ras , EMT is commonly associated with insensitivity to TKI treatment or loss of oncogene addiction [ 24 , 25 , 27 ] . In ALK - rearranged NSCLC previous studies reported the acquisition of an EMT phenotype associated with the acquired resistance to ALK TKI treatment , in some instances secondary to activation of TGF - β signaling pathway or induced by hypoxic conditions , in other cases by other still unknown mechanisms [ 26 , 53 – 55 ] . None of the previous works , however , directly addressed the question whether sustained ALK oncogenic activity was responsible for Oncotarget 33324 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget Figure 5 : EML4 - ALK ectopic expression in immortalized bronchial epithelial cells induces a mesenchymal phenotype .

Here we describe that overall ALK - rearranged NSCLC cell lines and primary tumors intrinsically show an EMT signature , although with some degree of heterogeneity . Two cell lines , H2228 and DFCI032 , showed an EMT phenotype , whereas H3122 cell line showed an epithelial differentiation completely lacking the expression of mesenchymal markers . The heterogeneous pattern of EMT is also a feature of primary lung cancers and cell lines driven by other oncogenes such as EGFR or K - Ras [ 20 , 24 , 27 , 37 ] , likely reflecting a multilayer complexity in the regulation of EMT in cancer [ 21 ] . Here , we provide evidence of a direct regulation of the EMT phenotype by EML4 - ALK , a regulation not fully investigated in NSLCL driven by other oncogenic mutations such as EGFR and K - Ras [ 24 , 27 ] . Indeed we showed that EGFR or ERBB family members did not contribute to the EMT phenotype in ALK - rearranged NSCLC . A recent report showed that EML4 - ALK induced an EMT phenotype when overexpressed in an ALK - negative NSCLC cell line [ 30 ] . However , overexpression experiments are always difficult to interpret , given that the signaling of RTKs strictly depends on their levels of expression . Our study now provides evidence that oncogenic ALK regulates EMT at endogenous expression levels at least in a subset of NSCLC . In H2228 and DFCI032 cell lines the inhibition of ALK activity reverted the phenotype and caused the mesenchymal to epithelial transition ( MET ) , down - regulating vimentin and concomitantly up - regulating E - cadherin . Because EMT is commonly associated with tumor progression and metastatization [ 15 , 16 ] or resistance to therapy [ 24 , 27 - 29 , 53 , 56 ] , these findings have important implications for the biology and treatment of ALK - rearranged NSCLC . Interestingly , we and others previously showed that H2228 and DFCI032 are intrinsically less sensitive to ALK inhibition than the H3122 cell line [ 43 , 57 ] , thus raising the possibility that the sensitivity to ALK TKIs could depend on the EMT phenotype of each NSCLC determined by ALK itself . Moreover , we demonstrated that EML4 - ALK directly promotes in vitro migration and invasion of NSCLC , thus suggesting that oncogenic ALK activity could contribute at least in part to the metastatic potential of NSCLC . To support this view , we previously showed that ALK controls in vivo liver metastasis formation in NSCLC xenografts in immunocompromised mice [ 58 ] and that the ALK oncogene directly regulates morphology , migration and cytoskeleton organization in ALK - rearranged lymphoma [ 59 , 60 ] . Thus , the effects that ALK exerts on proteins related to cell morphology and motility seem to be a common feature of ALK - rearranged tumors independently from the cell or tissue origin . However , in particular in ALK - rearranged epithelial cells , the heterogeneity between tumors is high and several other molecules such as EGFR family members could contribute to the various phenotypes together with ALK . EMT is mainly regulated by a complex network of transcription factors that potently induce the repression of E - cadherin and other junctional proteins , such as claudins and desmosomes [ 21 , 22 , 42 ] . These transcription factors , so called EMT - inducing transcription factors , belong to the Snail , Twist and Zeb families and are strongly interconnected to drive EMT in normal and cancer cells [ 22 , 61 ] . We demonstrated that ALK activity directly regulated the protein expression levels of Snail , as previously reported [ 30 ] , and ZEB1 . Figure 6 : EML4 - ALK regulates E - cadherin expression through ESRP1 repression . A . H2228 and DFCI032 cell lines were transduced with a lentivirus expressing the human ESRP1 , collected and blotted with the indicated antibodies . B . H2228 and DFCI032 were infected with pLKO expressing an shRNA targeting ESRP1 or a control shRNA ( shCtrl ) . Cells were treated with ALK inhibitors for 96 hours and harvested for Western Blot analysis with the indicated antibodies . Oncotarget 33326 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget In addition , EMT is also regulated post transcriptionally by alternative splicing of mRNA that encode specific protein isoforms related to the maintenance of the epithelial phenotype [ 22 , 44 , 52 ] . The epithelial splicing regulatory protein 1 and 2 ( ESRP1 / 2 ) , master regulators of EMT , are epithelial - specific proteins that maintain a specific splicing program in epithelial cells . Repression or low expression of ESRP1 / 2 causes a splicing switch that induces a mesenchymal phenotype and control E - cadherin expression [ 52 ] . We found that in H2228 and DFCI032 cell lines ESRP1 / 2 were expressed at low levels . Importantly , in both normal and lung cancer cells ESRP1 / 2 were regulated by ALK oncogenic activity . ESRP1 repression resulted in E - cadherin down - regulation and ESRP1 enforced expression led to E - cadherin up - regulation in ALK - rearranged NSCLC . These findings suggest that ALK sustains the mesenchymal phenotype in NSCLC by inducing a transcriptional regulation of E - cadherin and an alternative splicing program mediated by ESRP proteins . Our findings might have important clinical implications because an EMT phenotype could contribute to predict TKI response and metastatic potential in each ALK - rearranged NSCLC . In this context , our findings that in NSCLC with an EMT phenotype , the inhibition of ALK activity by TKIs at least partially reverts the phenotype could have implication in the design of novel therapeutic strategies that rely on different drug combinations . MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell lines and reagents Human ALK - rearranged NSCLC cell lines , H2228 ( variant 3 , E6 ; A20 ) , DFCI032 and H3122 ( variant 1 , E13 ; A20 ) , were grown in DMEM ( Lonza ) with 10 % FCS ( Lonza ) . 293T packaging cells , were cultured in DMEM ( Lonza ) with 10 % FCS ( Lonza ) . The H2228 TTA A5 ( shALK ) were generated as previously described and shRNA expression wad induced with 1µg / ml doxycycline - hyciclate ( Sigma ) [ 43 ] . BEAS - 2B cells were purchased from ATCC ( # CRL9609 ) and grown in bronchiolar epithelial cell basal medium ( Lonza ; # CC - 3170 ) . For ALK inhibitors , NVP - TAE684 was purchased from Axon Medchem and Crizotinib ( PF - 02341066 ) was kindly gifted by Pfizer . DNA constructs , virus preparation and cell infection The retroviral vector , pallino , expressing EML4 - ALK or the kinase dead , EML4 - ALK K589R was previously described [ 43 ] . Lentiviral vectors containing shRNA targeting ESRP1 or a control sequence were obtained from Sigma . Lentiviral vector containing ESRP1 cDNA was previously described [ 62 ] . Retroviruses and lentiviruses were generated and cells were infected as previously described [ 43 ] . Western blot analysis Cells were lysed as previously described [ 43 ] . The following antibodies were used : anti - ALK ( clone D5F3 ) , anti - phospho - ALK ( Y1604 ) , anti - E - cadherin , anti - vimentin , anti - N - cadherin , anti - phospho - EGFR ( Y1068 ) , anti - EGFR ( clone D38B1 ) , anti - phospho - ERBB2 ( Y1221 - Y1222 ) , anti - ERBB2 ( clone D8F12 ) , anti - ERBB3 ( clone D22C5 ) and anti - Snail , were from Cell Signaling Technology ; anti - ZEB1 ( clone H - 102 ) and anti - Twist ( clone H - 81 ) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology ; anti - PTP4A1 was from Proteintech ; anti - ESRP1 / 2 was from Rockland and anti - actin was from Sigma . Data mining on public available ALK - rearranged NSCLC Eleven ALK positive samples were collected from GEO31210 , 5 annotated ALK fusion samples from TCGA Lung Adenocarcinoma Dataset ( LUAD ) , and 29 adjacent normal samples from TCGA LUAD . Gene normalization was used to normalize all GEO data based on all TCGA cancer samples in order to remove batch effect and technology bias . KS test was applied in R to test whether EMT signatures ( n = 6 ) in MSigDB were enriched in the differentially expressed genes between ALK - rearranged tumors and normal tissues [ 35 ] . To test whether EMT signatures can distinguish normal and tumor samples , hierarchical clustering was performed on an EMT activated signatures ( “ALONSO _ METASTASIS _ UP” ) of normalized expression levels both on the gene and sample levels . RNA sequence analysis 100nt Paired - end RNA - Seq was performed on H2888 cells treated with TAE - 684 for 48 and 72 hours . Untreated H2228 were used as control . The reads were aligned to hg19 reference using Tophat aligner [ 38 ] . Cuffdiff was used to identify differentially expressed genes in cells treated with ALK inhibitor ( TAE - 684 ) and cells treated with DMSO ( controls ) ( FDR 0 . 05 cutoff ) [ 38 ] . Hyper - geometric test was performed on both the up - regulated and down - regulated genes upon ALK inhibition against MSigDB C2 CGP signature sets [ 35 ] . RT 2 profiler PCR array Real - time PCR was used for RT 2 Profiler PCR Array ( 96 - well format ) for Human Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition ( EMT ) ( QIAGEN ) in combination with IQ Sybr Oncotarget 33327 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget Green Supermix ( BIO - RAD ) according to manufacturer’s instructions . RT - PCR was carried out on a BIO - RAD iCycler and calculation of the threshold cycles was performed using iCycler . Definition of the baseline , the threshold and statistical analysis were obtained according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Normalization was performed against normalization genes provided by array plate . Immunofluorescence Adherent cells were grown on glass coverslips , fixed in 4 % para - formaldehyde and incubated with the primary antibodies ( same as Western Blot ) as previously described [ 59 ] . Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI . Cells were evaluated with a 40x objective using a Leica photomicroscope and images were acquired using the DM LM Leica software . Histology and immunohistochemistry For histological evaluation , tissue samples were fixed in formalin , embedded in paraffin , stained and visualized as previously described [ 58 ] . Paraffin - embedded tissue sections ( 2 - µm thick ) were immunostained with primary antibodies for E - cadherin , vimentin and ESRP1 on a semiautomated immunostainer . Anti - E - cadherin and anti - vimentin antibodies were the same used for Western blot analysis . For IHC , anti - ESRP1 was from ThermoFisher . Quantitative real time PCR ( qRT - PCR ) Total RNA from cell lines was extracted from cells using Trizol ( Ambion Invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Reverse transcription – polymerase chain reactions ( RT - PCRs ) were performed from 1μg RNA using random primers and SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase ( Invitrogen ) . Real - time RT - PCR was carried out on a BIO - RAD iCycler using IQ Sybr Green Supermix ( BIO - RAD ) . Calculation of the threshold cycles was performed using iCycler and normalization was performed against HUPO housekeeping gene according to the formula 2 - ΔΔCt where ΔCt = Ct ( threshold cycle ) gene of interest – Ct internal control , as indicated by the manufacturer . Primers used in quantitative RT - PCR for : Migration and invasion assays Migration assays were performed using Transwell ® Permeable Supports ( 0 , 8µm pores ; 24 well multiple well plate ; Corning ) . Invasion assays were performed using BD BioCoat Matrigel Invasion Chambers ( BD Biosciences ) . Cells were serum starved 24 hours prior to migration assay . 5 × 10 4 cells / well in 100µl serum - free media containing DMSO or 300nM ALK TKIs , TAE - 684 or crizotinib , were placed in the upper chamber of the transwell and then placed in 24 - well plate with DMEM containing 20 % FCS as a chemoattractant . Non - migrated cells were removed from the top of the inserts with a cotton swab and migrated cells were fixed and colored with Giemsa . Migrated cells were counted using a light microscope . The number of migrated cells was evaluated on five fields per chamber ( 20x objective ) . The percentage of migration or invasion was calculated relative to the controls treated with DMSO . Mice and in vivo experiments NOD - SCID mice ( Charles River Laboratories Italia S . p . A ) were inoculated s . c in both flanks ( single cell suspension , 1 × 10 7 cells in 0 . 2 ml PBS ) . Four mice were included in the control group ( treated with vehicle ) and 4 mice in the treatment group . Treatment started when s . c . tumors reached 0 . 5 cm mean diameter . Mice were treated once a day with 25mg / kg of TAE - 684 . Mice were sacrificed after 5 days of inhibitor treatment to perform histology and immunohistochemistry . Mice were handled and treated in accordance with European Community guidelines . Statistical analysis Statistical significance was calculated with T - Student test .
