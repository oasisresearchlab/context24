The timing of auxilin arrival deter - mines that uncoating will commence only after the clathrin lattice has fully assembled and after mem - brane ﬁssion is complete . Auxilin has a region resem - bling PTEN , a PI3P phosphatase . We have deter - mined the crystal structure of this region of bovine auxilin 1 ; it indeed resembles PTEN closely . A change in the structure of the P loop accounts for the lack of phosphatase activity . Inclusion of phosphatidyli - nositol phosphates substantially enhances liposome binding by wild - type auxilin , but not by various mutants bearing changes in loops of the C2 domain . Nearly all these mutations also prevent recruitment of auxilin to newly budded coated vesicles . We pro - pose a speciﬁc geometry for auxilin association with a membrane bilayer and discuss implications of this model for the mechanism by which auxilin detects separation of a vesicle from its parent membrane . INTRODUCTION Clathrin - mediated endocytosis carries a large part of the membrane trafﬁc that originates at the cell surface and termi - nates at membrane - bound internal compartments . Assembly of a clathrin lattice around an invaginating vesicle engulfs membrane - associated components , including receptors and their bound ligands ( Brett and Traub , 2006 ; Kirchhausen , 2009 ) . Once the vesicle has pinched off from the parent mem - brane , the coat is lost , and its components are recycled ( Lee et al . , 2006 ; Massol et al . , 2006 ) . The vesicle itself can then fuse with the membrane of a suitable target compartment . The uncoating step is the point at which ATP hydrolysis drives the cycle of clathrin assembly and disassembly in a unique direction ( Barouch et al . , 1994 ; Greene and Eisenberg , 1990 ; Schmid and Rothman , 1985 ) . The uncoating ATPase is Hsc70 , a member of the heat shock protein 70 ( Hsp70 ) family . Like all Hsp70 homo - logs , Hsc70 has a J - domain containing partner that determines the speciﬁcity of its target . In the case of clathrin coats , the rele - vant J - domain protein is known as auxilin ( Ungewickell et al . , 1995 ) . Endocytic clathrin - coated vesicles shed their coats almost immediately after budding from the plasma membrane ( Lee et al . , 2006 ; Massol et al . , 2006 ) . The timing is determined by the arrival of auxilin , which in turn recruits Hsc70 . Recruitment of auxilin only after membrane budding is complete ensures that Hsc70 - driven uncoating does not compete with coat assembly ( Massol et al . , 2006 ) . Mammalian species have two auxilin paralogs : auxilin 1 ( Ahle and Ungewickell , 1990 ) , which is neuron speciﬁc , and auxilin 2 , which is ubiquitous . The organi - zation of the auxilin 1 polypeptide chain is shown in Figure 1A . The elements essential for binding clathrin coats and recruiting Hsc70 are in the C - terminal half of the molecule . The N - terminal part has an amino acid sequence that can be aligned with the phosphatase and C2 domains of the phosphoinositide phospha - tase , PTEN . Differences at key residues in the catalytic cleft suggest that the PTEN - like region of auxilin will not have phos - phatase activity , however , and indeed , no activity can be detected . Auxilin 2 , also known as GAK ( cyclin G - associated kinase ; Kanaoka et al . , 1997 ) , has an additional , N - terminal kinase domain . A fragment of auxilin 1 comprising residues 547 – 910 supports Hsc70 and ATP - dependent uncoating in vitro as well as does the full - length protein ( Holstein et al . , 1996 ) . In cells , however , auxilin that lacks the PTEN - like region fails to associate with coated vesicles ( Massol et al . , 2006 ) . The PTEN - like part of auxilin thus appears to be the detector that reports when the vesicle within the coat has separated from the plasma membrane ( Massol et al . , 2006 ) . Electron cryomicroscopy ( cryoEM ) and three - dimensional image reconstruction of clathrin coats with bound auxilin ( 547 – 910 ) show that the clathrin - binding region ( residues 550 – 750 , approximately ) contacts a surface of the cla - thrin terminal domain , on the internal face of the clathrin lattice ( Fotin et al . , 2004 ) . The PTEN - like region would then project inward and presumably contact the lipid vesicle . Because the amino acid sequence of this region implies that it closely resem - bles a phosphoinositide phosphatase ( Haynie and Ponting , 1996 ) , we have proposed that it is likely to recognize a phosphoi - nositide head group ( Massol et al . , 2006 ) . We have further sug - gested that stable recruitment at the concentration of auxilin in a cell requires both the contacts with clathrin seen by cryoEM Structure 18 , 1191 – 1198 , September 8 , 2010 ª 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved 1191 and a membrane interaction of the PTEN - like domain . If an enzymatic activity that generates the species recognized by that domain is present in the coat , then its product will diffuse rapidly away as long as the vesicle bud remains continuous with the adjacent plasma membrane . As soon as dynamin - driven ﬁssion is complete , however , the product will accumulate in the vesicle . One candidate for this postulated enzymatic activity is synaptojanin , a lipid phosphatase that remove the 5 - phos - phate from PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 ( Perera et al . , 2006 ; Woscholski et al . , 1997 ) . We describe here the structure of the PTEN - like region of aux - ilin 1 , which we have determined to help test the mechanism out - lined in the preceding paragraph . The structure is , as expected , nearly identical to that of PTEN ( Lee et al . , 1999 ) . The ‘‘catalytic cleft , ’’ although devoid of enzymatic activity , has essentially the same geometry as in PTEN , and it could therefore accommodate an inositol phosphate group . We show that the fragment we have crystallized , auxilin ( 40 – 400 ) , binds liposomes containing PI4P and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 and that mutations in the C2 domain , in loops known to contact membranes in C2 domains of other proteins , eliminate this binding . We also tested the effects of the mutations on recruitment of full - length auxilin to coated pits , using previ - ously described live - cell imaging methods and found good concordance of lipid - binding and recruitment . We propose a model for the orientation of the protein on a membrane bilayer and discuss its implications for the mechanism by which auxilin detects separation of a vesicle from its parent membrane . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Structure Determination We expressed a set of nested constructs , spanning the pre - dicted PTEN homology region within the N - terminal half of bovine auxilin 1 . We could recover auxilin ( 1 – 400 ) with good yield , but the product showed evidence of proteolytic degrada - tion to a smaller , stable species . Mass spectrometric analysis identiﬁed the end product as auxilin ( 40 – 400 ) , which we expressed , puriﬁed , and crystallized as outlined in Experimental Figure 1 .

Structure Structure of the PTEN - like Region of Auxilin 1192 Structure 18 , 1191 – 1198 , September 8 , 2010 ª 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved Procedures . The crystals are in space group P3221 ( a = b = 137 . 9 , c = 51 . 3 ) , with a single polypeptide chain per asymmetric unit . We recorded diffraction data to a minimum Bragg spacing of 2 . 18 A˚ and determined the structure by molecular replace - ment with a modiﬁed PTEN structure as the search model . Table 1 summarizes the data collection and reﬁnement statistics . The ﬁnal model contains residues 60 – 75 and 88 – 399 ; the ﬁrst 20 residues and the loop spanning residues 76 – 87 are disor - dered ( Figure 2 ) . Molecular Structure The molecule has a roughly crescent shaped outline , about 60 3 35 3 35 A˚ in external dimensions . Just as does PTEN itself ( Lee et al . , 1999 ) , auxilin ( 40 – 399 ) comprises a phosphatase - like domain ( residues 54 – 216 ) and a C2 domain ( residues 226 – 363 ) . Residues 363 – 399 extend back against the phosphatase - like domain , so that the N and C termini of the fragment polypep - tide chain are at the same end of the crescent . The interface between the two domains contains both hydrogen - bond networks and a hydrophobic core , so that the orientation of one domain with respect to the other is probably ﬁxed . In PTEN , the interface is also a tight one , and mutations at that interface compromise function . The structure of the phosphatase - like domain follows very closely that of the PTEN phosphatase domain ( rmsd = 1 . 60 A˚ for 130 of the 144 ordered alpha carbons between residues 62 and 217 ) , but with some altered active - site residues . The ‘‘P loop’’ ( residues 160 – 167 ) ( Figure 3A ) differs in conformation from its PTEN counterpart , so that the tip of the loop covers what would be the active - site cysteine at its base . In auxilin , the HCxxGxxR motif , conserved in P loops of protein tyrosine phosphatases and dual - speciﬁcity phosphatases as well as in PTEN and its orthologs , lacks the ﬁnal arginine , and various other residues believed to participate in substrate recognition or in catalysis are also different ( e . g . , auxilin Ile129 , which corre - sponds to PTEN Asp92 ) . Nonetheless , except for absence of the cavity presumably occupied by the D3 phosphate of PtdIns - 3 , 4 , 5 - P3 , the inactive ‘‘catalytic cleft’’ in auxilin has roughly the same shape as the active cleft in PTEN . The C2 domain , a sandwich of two , four - stranded , antiparallel b sheets , has a so - called topology II C2 structure and lacks the canonical Ca2 + liganding residues in loops 1 and 3 that charac - terize those C2 domains dependent on Ca2 + for lipid - binding activity ( Sutton et al . , 1995 ; Sutton and Sprang , 1998 ) . Its frame - work of eight b strands is essentially identical to that of PTEN ( rmsd = 1 . 09 A˚ for 80 residues between 227 and 364 ) , but the loops deviate more substantially , especially loops b 1 - b 2 and b 5 - b 6 , on the surface of the domain that probably faces the membrane . The b 5 - b 6 loop projects away from the body of the domain as an unusually long , somewhat twisted , b hairpin . It contains three positively charged residues , and two exposed hydrophobic side chains project at its tip . In PTEN , there is a disordered loop ( b 6 - b 7 ) on the side of the C2 domain likely to face away from the membrane ; this loop , excised when the PTEN structure was determined , is a short , well - ordered turn in auxilin . Membrane Binding We examined association of auxilin ( 40 – 400 ) with large , multila - mellar PC liposomes containing the negatively charged phos - pholipids , PS , PI , PI4P and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 at 5 % , 10 % , and 15 % , with pure PC liposomes as a control . The liposomes were sedi - mented and examined by SDS - PAGE ( Figure 3B ) . Only the phos - phoinositide - containing liposomes bound the auxilin fragment more strongly than PC alone , with an approximate afﬁnity ranking , PI4p > PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 , in agreement with previous lipid - over - lay data ( Lee et al . , 2006 ; Massol et al . , 2006 ) . We also tested the effects of mutations in loops 1 ( b 1 - b 2 ) and 3 ( b 5 - b 6 ) of the C2 domain , likely from studies of other C2 domains to be important membrane contacts ( Bai et al . , 2004 ) ( Figures 1B and 3C ) . We changed positively charged residues in these loops into negatively charged residues , in various combinations , and we mutated two hydrophobic residues in the b 5 - b 6 loop individually to aspartic acid . The positively charged residues do not corre - spond to the canonical Ca2 + liganding residues in loops 1 and 3 required for the Ca2 + dependent lipid - binding activity of C2 domains ( Sutton et al . , 1995 ; Sutton and Sprang , 1998 ) , as they are absent in the C2 domain of auxilin . We also made two mutants with changes in the P loop of the phosphatase - like domain : His159 and Cys160 to Ala in one construct and Gly164 to Ala in the other . The mutations in the C2 domain all reduced binding to liposomes containing phosphoinositides but had no discernable effect on binding to liposomes that con - tained PC with PI or PS ; the mutations in the P loop had little or no effect . We conclude that membrane afﬁnity and possibly a con - tribution to head group speciﬁcity depend strongly on the C2 - domain surface that includes the b 1 - b 2 and b 5 - b 6 loops ( Figure 3A ) . The corresponding loops on one of the two C2 domains of synaptotagmin likewise appear to interact with a phosphoinositide - containing membrane ( Bai et al . , 2004 ) . There is evidence that Ca2 + binding induces a reorientation of domain C2B , causing its b 1 - b 2 and b 5 - b 6 loops to insert into the bilayer , but there is no indication that these loops participate in speciﬁc interactions with phosphoinositides .

Deﬁnitive exploration of that region will require a more exhaustive mutational analysis . We have failed to obtain crystals with a short - chain phosphoino - sitide , which could guide choice of mutations . The published structure of PTEN does not have a bound substrate : a model forPTENsubstratebindingisbasedonatartratefromthecrystal - lization medium at the active site of the enzyme ( Lee et al . , 1999 ) . Recruitment of Auxilin to Coated Pits We tested the effects of the mutations just described on recruit - ment of auxilin to coated pits , using previously described live - cell imaging methods ( Massol et al . , 2006 ; Saffarian and Kirchhausen , 2008 ) . In the earlier work , we had shown that aux - ilin appears in coated pits only after a burst of dynamin has led to Figure 2 .

In Figure 4A , we show as kymograph displays , the ﬂuorescence from clathrin ( labeled with a light - chain - mCherry chimera ) and full - length auxilin ( labeled with EGFP ) . The abrupt appearance of auxilin , just before uncoating ( loss of the clathrin signal ) , is evident in Figure 4A ( construct # 1 , Aux1 wt ; wild - type control ) . Its absence is equally clear in Figure 4A , which shows the effect of one particular mutation ( con - struct # 3 , Aux1 R301E / R307E / K311E ) and conﬁrms that deletion of the PTEN domain ( construct # 0 , D PTEN Aux1 ) also eliminates recruitment ( Lee et al . , 2006 ; Massol et al . , 2006 ) . We note that in the case of the mutant auxilin , the cla - thrin still uncoats , as expression of the mutated , ﬂuorescent auxilin does not eliminate recruitment of endogenous auxilin . Figure 4B compares the number of coated - pit associated auxilin spots in cells expressing wt auxilin and each of the mutants . The concordance of lipid - binding and recruitment is good , except for the R245E mutation ( construct # 16 ) , which diminishes lipid binding but has no detectable effect on coated - pit association . Model for Membrane Binding The various C2 - domain mutations that diminish membrane association in the experiments reported in Figure 3C are likely to map direct contacts with the lipid bilayer . The changes included charge reversal at several positively charged residues , which we propose will interact with negatively charged lipid head groups , and introduction of aspartic acid instead of hydro - phobic residues at the tip of loop 3 . Assuming that the catalytic cleft of the phosphatase - like domain also interacts with a lipid head group ( presumably from a phosphoinositide ) , then only the orientation of the C2 and phosphatase - like domains shown in Figure 3A will allow all the relevant residues to face the membrane . Depending on how far loop 3 of the C2 domain Structure Structure of the PTEN - like Region of Auxilin 1194 Structure 18 , 1191 – 1198 , September 8 , 2010 ª 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved dips into the membrane ( for example , whether the hydrophobic side chains at the tip of the loop penetrate as far as the proximal methylene groups of the fatty - acyl chains ) , it is possible that an inositol phosphate head group could be accommodated in the cleft of the phosphatase - like domain without displacing the phosphoinositide from its normal position within the bilayer . The C terminus of the entire fragment is positioned so that the polypeptide chain that follows could project away from the membrane and toward the clathrin coat . The 150 amino acid residues between the end of the PTEN - like region and the N terminus of the clathrin - binding region could easily span the (cid:3) 100 A˚ gap between the location of the auxilin J - domain in a clathrin coat and its vesicle membrane . That segment is prob - ably also quite extended in solution , as the Stokes radius of intact auxilin ( 62 A ˚ ) is much larger than expected for a 900 residue globular protein ( Ahle and Ungewickell , 1990 ) . Potential Role of Speciﬁc Lipid Binding in Recruiting Auxilin to Newly Budded Coated Vesicles The only reasonably abundant phosphoinositide in the plasma membrane is PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 ( about 0 . 5 % of total lipid ) . Indeed , Figure 3 .

The model is oriented to show the proposed orientation of this part of auxilin with respect to the cell membrane . ( B ) The upper panel shows Coomassie blue stain - ing after SDS - PAGE fractionation of wild - type PTEN - like region of auxilin 1 bound to liposomes containing either PC only or varying amounts ( % w / w ) of the indicated lipids . The bottom panel shows a bar plot comparing the average relative binding obtained from two independent experi - ments . To facilitate the comparison , the data were normalized to zero ( binding to liposomes containing only PC ) and 100 % ( binding to lipo - somes containing 15 % PI4P ) . ( C ) Bar plot comparing the relative binding ( average ±SD ) of wild - type and mutants forms of the PTEN - like region of auxilin to liposomes con - taining 85 % and 15 % PI4P . The results in each bar are from three independent experiments . interaction with the head group of this lipid assists recruitment to the plasma membrane of proteins such as the AP - 2 clathrin adaptor ( Cremona et al . , 1999 ; Gaidarov and Keen , 1999 ) . As auxilin recruitment occurs only after a vesicle has separated from the bulk membrane ( Lee et al . , 2006 ; Massol et al . , 2006 ) , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 in unlikely to determine speciﬁc binding to the pinched - off vesicle . PI - 4 - P is a better candidate , as it could be produced from PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 by an enzyme such as synaptojanin or similar lipid phosphatase recruited to the coated pit or to the coated vesicle ( Perera et al . , 2006 ) . Even if that enzyme were present before membrane ﬁssion , the product would diffuse out of the bud and PI { 4 , 5 } P2 would maintain its equilibrium concentration . A vesicle 700 A˚ in diameter ( about the size the vesicle within a typical endocytic clathrin coat containing 60 – 80 triskelions ) would contain about 100 PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 mole - cules , and even partial conversion to PI4P would recruit sufﬁ - cient auxilin to drive uncoating ( e . g . , one auxilin per vertex ) . The strongest binding in the experiments in Figure 3 is indeed to liposomes with PI4P , a result that is in agreement with earlier observations using lipid - strips ( Lee et al . , 2006 ; Massol et al . , 2006 ) . A deﬁnitive conclusion will require both a more sensitive and quantitative assay and a structure with a suitable ligand .

Reﬁnement of the model was carried out with Refmac5 ( in CCP4 ) , with a random subset of 5 % of all the reﬂections set aside for cross validation and Rfree calculation . Manual adjustments to the models were carried out with Coot ( Emsley and Cowtan , 2004 ) . Afterthereﬁnementoftheproteinpartwascompleted , solvent molecules were added . The model has good stereochemistry , with 89 . 5 % of residuesinthemost favoredregionoftheRamachandran plotand noneindis - allowed regions . Reﬁnement statistics are presented in Table 1 . Liposome Binding Assay Liposomes used for the binding assay contained at least 85 % ( w / w ) phospha - tidylcholine ( PC ) and up to 15 % ( w / w ) of phosphatidylserine ( PS ) , phosphati - dylinositol ( PI ) , phosphatidylinositol 4 - phosphate , ( PI4P ) , phosphatidylinosi - tol - and ( 4 , 5 ) - bis - phosphate ( PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 ) ( Avanti Polar Lipids , Inc . , Alabaster , AL ) . To prepare liposomes , the appropriate lipid stock solutions in chloroform were mixed , evaporated under a gentle nitrogen gas stream , and dried over - night under vacuum . Liposomes were made at room temperature by vigorous vortex mixing for 1 min with 10 mM Tris ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 50 mM NaCl , 1 mM DTT to a ﬁnal total lipid concentration of 1 . 25 mM . The binding assay was performed for 25 min at room temperature using approximately 1 m M protein and 1 mM freshly prepared liposomes in a ﬁnal volume of 125 m l ; the incubated liposomes were centrifuged at 70 , 000 rpm ( TLA - 100 rotor ; TL100 ultracentrifuge ; Beckman Coulter , Inc , Brea , CA ) for 10 min at 4 (cid:1) C . The supernatant was carefully removed , and the pellet fraction wassubjectedtoSDS - 12 % PAGEanalysisusingCoomassiebluestainingand gel densitometry . Data are reported as average of two independent experi - ments ( Figure 3B ) or as average ±SD of three independent experiments ( Figure 3C ) . Live - Cell Imaging BSC1 monkey cells stably expressing rat brain LCa1 - cherry were used in conjunction with transient expression of wild - type EGFP - auxilin1 or of selected mutants within its PTEN - like domain . Cells were used approximately 20 hr posttransfection with Lipofectamine ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) as previ - ously described ( Massol et al . , 2006 ) . Cells expressing relatively low amounts of the ﬂuorescent auxilin chimeras were selected for live - cell imaging using total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy ( Saffarian and Kirch - hausen , 2008 ) . About 20 , 000 – 40 , 000 cells were plated on glass # 1 . 5 cover - slips ( 25 mm in diameter ) 10 hr before the actual imaging experiment . Up to thispoint , thecells weregrown at37 (cid:1) C , inDulbecco’sModiﬁedEagleMedium ( DMEM ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum and in the presence of humidiﬁed air and 5 % CO 2 . Cells were imaged in GIBCO’s CO 2 independent medium in the absence of phenol red ( Invitrogen ) and in the presence of humidiﬁed air . The temperature of the sample holder ( 20 / 20 Technologies , Wilmington , NC ) was kept at 37 (cid:1) C using a Peltier - controlled holding device . The holding device and the stage were surrounded by a custom - designed air - controlled environmental chamber kept at 33 (cid:1) C – 35 (cid:1) C . The TIRF imaging experiments were conducted as described ( Massol et al . , 2006 ; Saffarian and Kirchhausen , 2008 ) using a Marianas system controlled with SLIDEBOOK 4 . 2 ( Intelligent Imaging Innovations , Denver , CO ) . The imaging system consists of an inverted 200M Zeiss microscope , a computer - controlled spherical aberration correction device , solid - state lasers exciting at 488 nm ( Coherent , Santa Clara , CA ) and 561 nm Cobolt , Solna Sweden ) , an acousto - optic tunable ﬁlter , a Dual - View unit ( Photometrics , Tucson , AZ ) equippedwitha565DCXRdichroicmirrorandHQ525 / 40andHQ620 / 50emis - sionﬁlters ( Chroma , Rockingham , VT ) andaQuantumEMCCDcamera ( Photo - metrics , Tucson , AZ ) .

Object tracks selected for analysis corresponded to clathrin - coated pits according to criteria described previously ( Ehrlich et al . , 2004 ; Massol et al . , 2006 ; Saffarian et al . , 2009 ; Saffarian and Kirchhausen , 2008 ) . Selected objectshavethefollowingcharacteristics : ( a ) theyappearasdiffraction - limited ﬂuorescent spots ; ( b ) they are present in both the ﬁrst and last frames of the time series ; ( c ) their centroid has moved less than two pixels ( (cid:3) 200 nm ) between consecutive time frames ; ( d ) the tracks do not merge with or disso - ciate from nearby objects . We determined the extent of auxilin association with endocytic clathrin pits in the selected object tracks by counting the number of colocalization events within a projection of the time series into asingleframe . Aswehaveshownpreviously ( Massoletal . , 2006 ) , auxilinspots appear as brief bursts just before loss of clathrin from the coated vesicle . In Figure 4 , representative examples are shown as kymographs normalized for intensity of ﬂuorescence .
