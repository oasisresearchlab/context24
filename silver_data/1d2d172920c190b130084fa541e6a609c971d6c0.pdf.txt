( 2002 ) - - “fuzzy similarity” based tradeoff method Coehoorn and Jennings ( 2004 ) - - “kernel density estimation” method Ros & Sierra ( 2006 ) - - “variability” method Assume the availability of the counterpart’s preferences or the availability of past negotiation history Components of a Design Theory ( Walls et al . 1992 ) Components of the Proposed Negotiation Agent Design 1 . Kernel Theory Dual concern model 2 . Meta - Requirements A win - win seeking negotiating agent ( 1 ) to achieve better economic outcomes for itself , and ( 2 ) to achieve better socio - economic outcomes for its human counterpart , ( 3 ) within a reasonable number of rounds Evaluation metrics that incorporate a socio - economic perspective of negotiation outcomes : counterpart agreement ratio , individual outcome , dyadic outcome , counterpart’s perception of the outcome , and counterpart’s perception of the agent 3 . Meta - Design Two major design features , i . e . , an offer strategy and an acceptance strategy , to comprise a complete negotiation strategy 4 . Testable Design Product and Hypotheses An agent artifact that embodies two new strategies , i . e . , the simultaneous - equivalent offers and delayed acceptance strategies , are more likely to produce better socio - economic outcomes in comparison to sequential - single offer and immediate acceptance strategies 2 . Socio - economic evaluation and relaxed assumption 3 . Complete strategy design 1 . Agent - human context Existing literature : agent - agent context ; pure economic evaluation and assumptions ; extensive focus on offer strategy  Information privacy with regard to others ◦ Preferences : multi - attribute utility ( MAU ) function ◦ Reservation condition : best alternative to a negotiated agreement ( BATNA )  Protocol / rules compliance ◦ bilateral alternate offer protocol , plus ◦ final offer rule  Multiple negotiation issues 100 Buyer’s Utility Value Seller’s Utility Value 100 Nash Equilibrium How can a seller make offers ? Seller’s Reservation Utility ( BATNA ) Buyer’s Reservation Utility ( BATNA ) Bargaining Zone Pareto Efficient Frontier How can a seller decide to accept the buyer’s offer ? Seller’s Target Utility Seller’s Starting Offer 0  sequential - single offer ( SEQ ) strategy : start with an offer of high self - utility and conceding in certain patterns  simultaneous - equivalent offers ( SIM ) : employ an “offer selection method” to send the counterpart multiple offers in each round ◦ H1 : higher counterpart acceptance ratio ◦ H2 : higher individual outcome ◦ H3 : higher joint outcome ◦ H4 : counterpart’s greater satisfaction with the outcome ◦ H5 : counterpart ' s greater perceived cooperativeness with the agent  immediate acceptance ( IMM ) strategy : accepts a counteroffer when it exceeds a single decision threshold  delayed acceptance ( DLY ) strategy : employ a parameter of “aspiration region” to respond to a counteroffer that meets its reservation utility ◦ H6 : higher individual outcome ◦ H7 : higher joint outcome ◦ H8 : counterpart’s greater satisfaction with the outcome Negotiation service URL ( backend ) : http : / / 202 . 83 . 249 . 16 / negotiation Negotiation client URL ( front end ) : http : / / 202 . 83 . 249 . 16 / LaptopOnDemand 1 . 2x2 factorial ( n = 110 ) , random assignment 2 . 110 working professionals and executives recruited in December 2008 3 .
