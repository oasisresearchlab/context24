Klann xi xii Summary This work focuses on the development of a stochastic simulation . It employs particle track - ing methods to elucidate the transport of signaling molecules through the cell . Furthermore the method is extended and applied to analyze vesicle transport between the cellular com - partments , especially focusing on the receptor mediated endocytosis which couples signal transduction and membrane trafﬁcking . The simulation is based on Brownian Dynamics , which has the advantage that the solvent – myriads of water molecules in the cell – does not have to be included . Only the molecules of interest diffuse through the virtual cell by performing a random walk in this Monte Carlo method . The cytoskeleton structure and crowding elements are included as stationary obsta - cles in order to model the structured intracellular conditions [ 75 , 105 , 182 ] . The simulation is able to reproduce the reduced effective diffusion of the in vivo system through these structures [ 127 , 152 ] . The correct , yet computationally efﬁcient modeling of the ( diffusion - limited ) re - actions in the cell requires an advanced simulation framework [ 8 , 168 , 239 , 252 ] . Due to molecular crowding not only the mobility but also the reaction rates are considerably changed under the in vivo conditions [ 75 , 206 ] . The present work quantiﬁes three factors which deter - mine the effective reaction rate , namely ( i ) the effect of the excluded volume , ( ii ) the effect of the reduced mobility , and ( iii ) the effect of the altered accessibility of the molecules . Ideally the simulation returns the effective in vivo reaction rate if the correct intracellular con - ditions and the in vitro rate are set as input parameters . Since the different parameters can be easily changed and controlled in the simulation , it can help to understand and bridge the gap between in vivo and in vitro kinetics . The simple and modular principle of the simulation also provides a versatile tool for the analysis of further intra - and extracellular reaction - diffusion processes . The present simulation was applied to signal transduction in the Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase ( MAPK ) pathway . Receptors in the plasma membrane of the cell are activated by a ligand , e . g . growth factors . This signal is then transferred to the mobile MAPK molecule via a cascade of molecules . The active ( phosphorylated ) form of MAPK can then trigger the genes regulating e . g . the growth of the cell . But on the way from the plasma membrane to the nucleus a fraction of the signal is lost due to dephosphorylation reactions – in the extreme xiii SUMMARY case no active MAPK molecule reaches the nucleus [ 143 ] . The simulation was used to ana - lyze this signal transduction process covering both the spatial and the stochastic properties . The results show , that the structure and the parameters of the model determine the outcome of the signaling system . The model was also extended to include transport by motor proteins along the cytoskeleton , which can increase the signal strength in the nucleus as predicted by Kholodenko [ 143 ] . The stochastic and spatial aspects are of an even greater importance in the ﬁeld of vesicle transport . The low number of vesicles in a cell leads to high stochastic ﬂuctuations . Fur - thermore the vesicles have to be guided to their target compartment through the crowded intracellular space . The simulation shows that this requires a specialized transport system in which the membrane trafﬁcking network is aligned with the cytoskeleton structures in the cell . The constraints which limit the functionality of the model lead to valuable insights into the system . The present model also includes the molecular machinery that governs the formation , trans - port , and targeting of the vesicles – namely coat molecules ( COPI , COPII , clathrin ) , SNAREs ( Soluble NSF Attachment Protein REceptors ) , and motor proteins ( Dynein , Kinesin , Myosin ) [ 66 ] . This enables investigating the maintenance of the vesicle machinery , their recycling , and especially the on demand regulation of vesicle formation based on cargo load – for example in receptor mediated endocytosis . The latter effect leads to a reduction of active receptors in the plasma membrane , thus reducing the signal strength in signal transduction . The simulation is able to couple vesicle transport and signal transduction models in order to investigate this effect [ 204 , 282 , 330 ] . Eventually also the polarization of the cell depends on the targeted vesicle transport [ 308 ] . Special proteins adjust the structure of the cytoskeleton based on the information of activated signaling molecules [ 247 , 302 ] . In close collaboration with Martin Falk and Prof . Thomas Ertl from the Institute for Visualiza - tion and Interactive Systems ( VIS ) , Universit ¨ at Stuttgart , Germany , a visualization framework has been developed [ 77 ] . It allows getting more out of the simulation output than plain num - bers by exploring the spatial aspects of the cell and the temporal development of the signal transduction process . Figure 1 shows an example including the cytoskeleton structure , the highlighted path of a selected molecule , and the local signal strength , which is calculated based on the local concentration of active MAPK molecules [ 78 ] . Focus & Context methods help to guide the eye through the crowded intracellular ( model - ) environment , and the user can interactively navigate through the cell and all the sequential time points of the stored sim - ulation results [ 77 ] . xiv SUMMARY ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Figure 1 : Visualization of the virtual cell con - taining cytoskeleton and crowding molecules ( gray spheres ) , receptors ( blue spheres ) sig - naling molecules ( orange ) with one high - lighted ( red ) molecule and its path .

Die Agenten - basierte Methode erm¨oglicht mit einer entsprechenden Erweiterung zudem die Anal - yse des Vesikeltransports zwischen den einzelnen membranumschlossenen Kom - partimenten der Zelle . Dabei wird auch die Kopplung des Vesikeltransports und der Signaltransduktion ber¨ucksichtigt , welche durch den Endozytose - Prozess der Rezeptoren ausgel¨ost wird . Die Simulation basiert auf der Modellierung der Brownschen Dynamik , bei der die Molek¨ule des L¨osungsmittels ( hier Milliarden von Wassermolek¨ulen ) nicht explizit ber¨ucksichtigt werden m¨ussen . Nur die Molek¨ule von Bedeutung werden im Mod - ell abgebildet und vollf¨uhren eine Zufallsbewegung in der Monte - Carlo Simulation . Die dichten Strukturen und Hindernisse des intrazellul¨aren Mediums [ 75 , 105 , 182 ] k¨onnen in der Simulation ebenfalls dargestellt werden und f¨uhren zu einer reduzierten effektiven Diffusionsrate durch die virtuelle Zelle , welche den realen Gegebenheiten in der Zelle entspricht [ 127 , 152 ] . In der Simulation wurde insbesondere darauf geachtet , dass die ( diffusions - limitier - ten ) Reaktionsprozesse in der Zelle richtig abgebildet und efﬁzient modelliert wer - den [ 8 , 168 , 239 , 252 ] . Aufgrund des ’molecular crowding’ – der dicht gedr¨angten Zust¨ande durch die vielen Makro - Molek¨ule in der Zelle – ¨andern sich die Reaktions - raten im Vergleich zu verd¨unnten in vitro Bedingungen , bei denen einzelne Reaktio - nen isoliert untersucht werden [ 75 , 206 ] . Die Simulation spiegelt diese Effekte wider . Dar¨uber hinaus k¨onnen die einzelnen Parameter des Modells einfach angepasst wer - den , so dass die Effekte einzeln untersucht und mit ihren Ursachen verkn¨upft werden k¨onnen . Dieses detailierte Verst¨andnis erlaubt es , die L¨ucke zwischen der in vivo und der in vitro Kinetik zu ¨uberbr¨ucken . xvi ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Die Simulation wurde verwendet , um die Signal¨ubertragung durch ein MAPK ( Mi - togen Activated Protein Kinase ) System zu modellieren . Darin werden Rezeptoren in der Plasmamembran der Zelle durch einen Liganden ( z . B . Wachstumsfaktoren ) aktiviert . Dieses Signal wird dann ¨uber eine Kaskade von Zwischenmolek¨ulen auf die mobilen MAPK - Proteine ¨ubertragen . Die aktive ( phosphorylierte ) Form MAPKp kann dann die entsprechenden Gene im Zellkern regulieren , welche z . B . das Wach - stum steuern . Auf dem Weg von der Plasmamembran zum Zellkern geht jedoch ein gewisser Teil des Signals verloren , da Phosphatasen die MAPKp - Molek¨ule de - phosporylieren . Im Extremfall kann das Signal den Kern gar nicht erreichen [ 143 , 168 ] . Die Simulation wurde verwendet um diesen Signalweg zu analysieren , wobei sowohl die r¨aumlichen als auch die stochastischen Eigenschaften ber¨ucksichtigt wur - den . Dar¨uber hinaus wurde auch der Transport der MAPKp durch Motor - Proteine entlang des Zytoskeletts zum Zellkern modelliert , was die St¨arke des Signals am Kern positiv beeinﬂussen kann [ 78 , 143 ] . Die stochastischen und r¨aumlichen Eigenschaften sind auf dem Feld des Vesikel - Transports von noch gr¨oßerer Bedeutung . Die niedrige Zahl der Vesikel in der Zelle f¨uhrt zu st¨arkeren stochastischen Fluktuationen . Außerdem m¨ussen die Vesikel gezielt zu ihren Zielkompartimenten gef¨uhrt werden . Das in der Simulation darge - stellte Modell vereint das heutige Wissen ¨uber den Vesikeltransport . Es zeigt , dass die Vesikel ein spezielles Transportsystem ben¨otigen , in dem die membranumh¨ullten Strukturen eng mit der Zytoskelettstruktur verbunden sein m¨ussen . Die Grenzen der Funktionalit¨at des Modells geben zudem wertvolle Hinweise auf die tats¨achliche Organisation des Systems . xvii Das hier vorgestellte Modell f¨ur die Bildung , den Transport und die Navigation bzw . Adressierung der Vesikel basiert auf molekularen Interaktionen . Dabei handelt es sich um Coat - Molek¨ule ( COPI , COPII , clathrin ) , SNAREs ( Soluble NSF Attachment Protein REceptors ) und Motor - Proteine ( Dynein , Kinesin , Myosin ) [ 66 ] . In diesem detailierten Modell kann die Aufrechterhaltung der Transport - Maschinerie , das Recy - cling der einzelnen Komponenten sowie die bedarfsgerechte Steuerung des Vesikel - Transports untersucht werden . Dies beinhaltet auch die Rezeptor - vermittelte En - dozytose . Die Untersuchung zeigt dar¨uber hinaus , dass die Zell - Polarit¨at durch den gerichteten Vesikeltransport beeinﬂusst werden kann [ 308 ] . Die daf¨ur erforderliche spezialisierte Zytoskelettstruktur wird im Gegenzug auch durch die Information von aktiven Signalmolek¨ulen kontrolliert [ 247 , 302 ] . In enger Zusammenarbeit mit Martin Falk und Prof . Thomas Ertl vom Institut f¨ur Visu - alisierung und Interaktive Systeme ( VIS ) an der Universit¨at Stuttgart wurde auch ein Visualisierungswerkzeug f¨ur die Simulationsergebnisse entwickelt [ 77 ] . Es erm¨oglicht neben den nackten Zahlen der Ergebnisse auch die r¨aumlichen und dynamischen Aspekte des Signal¨ubertragungsprozesses interaktiv zu erforschen . Abbildung 1 zeigt ein Beispiel f¨ur die Visualisierung : die Zytoskelettstruktur , der Pfad eines einzel - nen , ausgew¨ahlten Signalmolek¨uls sowie die lokale Dichte der Signalmolek¨ule ist neben den einzelnen Molek¨ulen dargestellt [ 78 ] . Focus & Context - Methoden helfen dabei , das Auge durch die intrazellul¨are ( Modell - ) Umgebung zu f¨uhren . Der Be - nutzer kann zudem interaktiv durch die Zelle navigieren und den zeitlichen Verlauf der Simulation nachvollziehen [ 77 ] . xviii ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Diese Arbeit wurde in der ersten F¨orderperiode des Zentrums Systembiologie ZSB an der Universit¨at Stuttgart durchgef¨uhrt . • Im Teilprojekt A4 ’4D - r¨aumlich - zeitliche Dynamik in zellul¨aren Signal¨uber tra - gungsprozessen : Modellierung , computerbasierte Analyse und Visualisierung’ wurde dabei die Simulation zusammen mit dem zugeh¨origen Visualisierungs - tool entwickelt und die Signal¨ubertragung der MAPK - Kaskade analysiert . • F¨ur das Teilprojekt A3 ’Quantitative Analyse und Modellierung von Membran - transportschritten im endosomalen Weg der Hefe Saccharomyces cerevisiae ’ wurde die Vesikel - Erweiterung der Simulationsmethode entwickelt sowie das entsprechende Modell des Vesikel - Transports parametrisiert und analysiert . Die folgenden Abschnitte fassen die Ergebnisse kurz zusammen . xix Ergebnis 1 : Effektive Diffusion in der Zelle Das Ziel einer detailierten Simulation , in der die mikroskopischen r¨aumlichen Eigen - schaften der Zelle abgebildet werden , machte eine detailierte Analyse der Auswirkun - gen dieser Strukturen auf die Mobilit¨at der Molek¨ule erforderlich . Die umfassende Analyse hat gezeigt , dass die Behinderung der Mobilit¨at der Molek¨ule sowohl von der Gr¨oße der Molek¨ule als auch von der Dichte und Struktur des Zytoskeletetts abh¨angt : Gr¨oßere Molek¨ule zeigen eine deutlich niedrigere effektive Diffusion als kleine und die Behinderung der Mobilit¨at steigt mit dem Volumenanteil den das Zy - toskelett in der Zelle einnimmt . Ein Zytoskelett - Netzwerk aus vielen d¨unnen Fila - menten hat wesentlich engere Maschen als eine Struktur aus wenigen großen Fil - amenten . Dementsprechend wird die Bewegung von gr¨oßeren Molek¨ulen im eng - maschigeren Netz st¨arker behindert . Gleiches gilt – allerdings weniger stark aus - gepr¨agt – auch f¨ur den Vergleich von Strukturen bei denen die L¨ange der Filamente variiert wird . Zudem konnte festgestellt werden , dass eine Struktur aus feststehen - den Kugeln eine andere Charakteristik im Bezug auf die effektive Diffusion aufweist als eine Struktur aus zylindrischen Skelett - Filamenten [ 152 ] . Neben dem ( in kurzen Zeitskalen ) statischen Zytoskelett haben auch alle anderen in der L¨osung beﬁndlichen Molek¨ule einen Einﬂuss auf die Beweglichkeit . Durch die Vielzahl der Molek¨ule ergibt sich eine sehr hohe Viskosit¨at des Cytosols , welche nach der Stokes - Einstein - Beziehung zu einer niedrigen Diffusionsrate f¨uhrt . Die schiere Anzahl der Molek¨ule und besonders die daraus resultierende Vielzahl der Interak - tionen welche ber¨ucksichtigt werden muss , macht eine Simulation des ’Molecular Crowding’ in dieser Arbeit jedoch unm¨oglich . Daher kann dieser Effekt nur implizit in den Modellen dargestellt werden [ 127 ] . xx ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Ergebnis 2 : Effektive Reaktionsraten in der Zelle Der beengte Zustand in der Zelle hat folgende Auswirkungen auf die Reaktionsrate : 1 . Die miteinander reagierenden Molek¨ule beﬁnden sich im freien Volumen , wel - ches durch alle anderen Molek¨ule deutlich reduziert ist . Daraus ergibt sich eine effektiv h¨ohere Konzentration im verbleibenden freien Volumen . Nach dem Massenwirkungsgesetz f¨uhrt dies zu einer h¨oheren Reaktionsrate . 2 . Gleichzeitig verhindern die Molek¨ule in der Zelle , dass Reaktanden jederzeit und von allen Seiten miteinander reagieren k¨onnen . Diese Behinderung re - duziert die Reaktionsrate . 3 . Im Zusammenhang mit Diffusions - kontrollierten Reaktionen spielt auch der fol - gende Punkt eine Rolle : nur wenn zwei Teilchen miteinander kollidieren , dann k¨onnen sie auch miteinander reagieren . Die Kollisionsrate h¨angt jedoch vom Diffusionskoefﬁzienten ab , je schneller sich die Teilchen bewegen , desto ¨ofter stossen sie zusammen . Entsprechend f¨uhrt die reduzierte effektive Diffusion in der Zelle zu einer reduzierten Kollisionsrate , was ebenfalls zu einer Senkung der Reaktionsrate f¨uhren kann . Diese drei Effekte wurden in dieser Arbeit analysiert und quantiﬁziert . Dar ¨ uber hin - aus wurde auch noch der Einﬂuss von tempor¨ar gebundenen Teilchen auf die Reak - tionsrate untersucht . Die Bindung an feste Strukturen wie das Zytoskelett f¨uhrt zu einer weiteren Reduktion der Mobilit¨at . Dies reduziert wiederum die Kollisionsrate der Reaktanden und somit die Reaktionsrate . Die Untersuchung hat gezeigt , dass die Reaktionsrate insbesondere von der Geschwindigkeit der Bindungs - Reaktion abh¨angt . xxi Ergebnis 3 : Efﬁzienz des Transports von Signalmolek ¨ulen in der Zelle Mobile Signalmolek¨ule m¨ussen zur Signal¨ubertragung durch den Raum transportiert werden . Innerhalb der Zelle k¨onnen sie dabei von Phosphatasen deaktiviert wer - den . Daher erreichen nicht alle Signalmolek¨ule den Zellkern im aktiven Zustand . Die St¨arke des Signals h¨angt entsprechend von der Reaktions - und Transportgeschwin - digkeit ab [ 144 , 167 ] . Signalmolek¨ule k¨onnen innerhalb der Zelle auch mit Motorproteinen am Zellskelett entlang transportiert werden . Dieser gerichtete Transport f¨uhrt zu einer deutlich st¨arkeren Akkumulation von Signalmolek¨ulen im Zellkern . Die Akkumulation im Zel - lkern wird allerdings auch entscheidend von der Transportrate durch die Kernporen mitbestimmt [ 78 ] . In dieser Arbeit wurde zudem das Modell der MAPK ( Mitogen Activated Protein Ki - nase ) Signal¨ubertragung von Fujioka et al . [ 89 ] mit der agenten - basierten Simulation untersucht . Das Modell umfasst eine mehrstuﬁge Signal - Kaskade mit ca . 1 Million mobilen Molek¨ulen in der Zelle . Die Simulationsmethode konnte die Dynamik in der Signal¨ubertragung trotz der großen Anzahl von Molek¨ulen in einer angemessenen Zeit berechnen . Aufgrund der langsamen Reaktionsraten ergeben sich in diesem Modell fast keine Gradienten in der Verteilung der aktiven Signalmolek¨ule . xxii ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Ergebnis 4 : Vesikeltransport – Navigation durch die Zelle In dieser Arbeit wird ein detailiertes Modell des Vesikel - Transports vorgestellt und analysiert . Die Bildung und Abschn¨urung der Vesikel vom Donor - Kompartiment aus wird dabei durch die Polymerisation von Coat - Molek¨ulen geregelt . Die speziﬁsche Bindung und Fusion mit dem Ziel - Kompartiment wird durch die Interaktion zwischen SNARE - Molek¨ulen sichergestellt . F¨ur den Transport zwischen den beiden Kompar - timenten sind zudem Motorproteine erforderlich . Diese Funktionen sind durch kurzreichweite molekulare Interaktionen darstellbar . Der gerichtete Transport der Vesikel erfordert jedoch eine ’intelligente’ Navigation durch die Zelle . Damit die Motorproteine den richtigen Weg durch die Zelle w¨ahlen und die Vesikel ihr richtiges Ziel erreichen , ist also eine langreichweitige Organisation und Strukturierung der Zelle n¨otig . • Diese Arbeit skizzierte eine m¨ogliche Anordnung des Zytoskeletts und der Kom - partimente in der Zelle , die einen funktionalen Vesikeltransport gew¨ahrleisten kann . Es sind jedoch genauere Daten n¨otig , um die tats¨achliche Organisation in der Zelle zu identiﬁzieren . • Die komplexen intrazellul¨aren Sortier - und Transportprozesse bauen auf eine Kombination von vernetzenden Aktin - Filamenten und des sternf¨ormig ange - ordneten Microtubuli Zytoskelett auf . Zentrale Kompartimente des Systems beﬁnden sich dabei im Zentrum des Microtubuli - Netzwerks . • ¨Uber die Ausrichtung des Zytoskeletts kann aufgrund des gerichteten Vesikel - transports zudem die Zellpolarisierung kontrolliert werden . xxiii Ausblick Die in dieser Arbeit entwickelte Simulationsmethode hat aufgrund ihrer objektorien - tierten Struktur ein vielf¨altiges Anwendungsspektrum und kann einfach an neue Frage - stellungen angepasst werden . Die hier dargestellten detailierten Erkenntnisse zu in vivo Reaktionen werfen auch neue Fragestellungen gerade zur r¨aumlichen Organi - sation in der Zelle auf . Die Untersuchung k¨onnte in Zukunft auf Prozesse erweitert werden , die r¨aumliche Strukturen enthalten , z . B . Scaffolds in der Signaltransduktion , oder Metabolic Channeling im Stoffwechsel . Auch die r¨aumlich - zeitliche Dynamik und Struktur des Vesikel - Netzwerks erfordert weitere und genauere Analysen . An dieser Stelle wird die Notwendigkeit von detailierten r¨aumlich - aufgel¨osten Daten - reihen offensichtlich , welche dann mittels eines System - orientierten Verfahrens in die Modelle integriert werden k¨onnen . Die von Martin Falk entwickelte Visualisierungs - methode [ 77 , 78 ] erlaubt es , komplexe Vorg¨ange in der Zelle anschaulich darzustellen und bietet so weitere Ans¨atze und Einsatzm¨oglichkeiten f¨ur die Simulation . Im Zuge einer Weiterentwicklung der Simulation sollte zudem eine Parallelisierung f¨ur Multi - Core CPUs , die parallere Architektur von Graﬁkkarten oder sogar der Ein - satz auf Hochleistungsrechnern angestrebt werden . Dadurch kann die Performanz der Simulation so weit gesteigert werden , dass z . B . Parameterstudien in großskali - gen Netzwerken in einem sinnvollen Zeitraum durchgef¨uhrt werden k¨onnen . xxiv xxv List of Abbreviations List of Abbreviations Methods : ODE Ordinary Differential Equation ( s ) PDE Partial Differential Equation ( s ) BD Brownian Dynamics MDS Molecular Dynamics Simulation Signal Transduction Components : EGFR Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor EGF Epidermal Growth Factor Ste2p Receptor in yeast for the mating pheropme α α mating pheromone in yeast MAPK Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase MAPKK MAPK Kinase ( activates MAPK ) MAPKKK MAPKK Kinase ( activates MAPKK ) Raf MAPKKK in the EGF signaling pathway MEK MAPKK in the EGF signaling pathway ERK MAPK in the EGF signaling pathway Ste11 MAPKKK in the yeast mating pathway Ste7 MAPKK in the yeast mating pathway Fus3 MAPK in the yeast mating pathway Vesicle Transport Machinery SNARE soluble N - ethylmaleimide - sensitive - factor attachment receptor ( responsible for vesicle fusion ) Coat refers to COPI , COPII , clathrin ( responsible for vesicle formation ) Motor refers to Dynein , Kinesin , Myosin ( responsible for vesicle translocation ) xxvi List of Symbols List of Symbols Symbol Dimension Explanation (cid:15) excluded volume fraction .

Signaling molecules carry information from the surface of the cell towards the nucleus in or - der to regulate gene activation [ 146 ] . In the cell , they are subject to a ’seemingly impenetrable jungle of molecular interactions’ [ 33 ] . Furthermore all the molecules in the cell occupy a con - siderable fraction of the cell volume , leading to crowded , hampering conditions [ 105 , 182 ] . The relevant reactions out of the total set of interactions are included in the present mod - els of signal transduction . In principle , the dynamics of signal transduction can be analyzed with ordinary differential equations [ 157 , 270 ] . However , the spatially structured cell and the stochasticity due to low molecule numbers limit the use of this approach [ 289 ] . In order to analyze signal transduction through the cell , an agent - based simulation has been developed , which preserves the stochastic nature of reactions as well as the undirected motion of diffu - sion . The physical location of each molecule is tracked in the simulation through a realistic model cell . Reactions are treated as discrete and stochastic events between individual objects . Thus , the present work contributes detailed insights on the spatial aspects in signal transduc - tion . The simulation is also extended so that it can handle the receptor mediated endocytosis pro - cess . The receptors in the plasma membrane trigger the formation of vesicles and are sub - sequently transported into the cell [ 330 ] . Endocytosed receptors can be recycled back to the plasma membrane or targeted for degradation , which regulates the number of receptors in the cell . The receptor number , in turn , determines the strength of the signal . The agents in the simulation can also represent vesicles . The vesicle cargo – receptors that are loaded into the vesicle but also molecules of the vesicle machinery – is then tracked in an additional layer of the simulation . This work elucidates the organization of vesicle transport 1 1 . INTRODUCTION between the compartments of the cell . Based on the functional vesicle transport module also the dynamics of the signal transduction due to the changing receptor number in the plasma membrane can be analyzed . The questions raised , reviewed , and reﬂected by Bray [ 33 ] outline the motivation for this work . Eventually , we will only be able to fully understand signal transduction in the cell if we understand why , where , when , and how a molecular complex is formed . Interestingly , signal transduction relies not only on the mobility of the molecules . Functional signal trans - duction rather requires a ﬁne tuning of the reaction rates and a speciﬁc spatial localization of the signaling molecules [ 33 , 114 , 146 ] . Two principles , ( i ) the undirected ’chaotic’ motion of diffusion , and ( ii ) structuring elements , which organize the compounds of signal transduction in scaffolds at speciﬁc locations , seem to be carefully balanced in the cell [ 151 , 197 ] . Analyzing the spatial organization reveals the complexity in the architecture of the cell and underlines the extraordinary self assembly and self organization capabilities of the structures of life [ 10 , 163 , 248 ] . From the whole organism via tissues and cells towards the organization of the DNA in the nucleus [ 174 ] : it seems that everything in life has a certain place . The cell is not just an unstructured bag of enzymes and molecules [ 192 ] . Therefore we have to know the distinct location , interaction , and function of every single molecule involved . Tackling these questions requires a systems - oriented approach , integrat - ing data from genomics , transcriptomics , metabolomics , etc . into one holistic model of the cell [ 211 ] . The emerging ﬁeld of systems biology is accordingly challenged by the task of putting the puzzle of life together in an interdisciplinary collaboration [ 170 ] . This thesis covers only a sub - module of signal transduction . But on the way to a complete model , it contributes a signiﬁcant piece to the puzzle . This piece itself consists of several components which are integrated in the multi - scale simulation framework . Moreover it can meaningfully connect some of the other contributions and ﬁndings within the puzzle , bringing us further towards the goal of putting the puzzle together . 1 . 2 Contributions and Aims The work and research for this thesis has been conducted in the ﬁrst funding period of the Cen - ter Systems Biology ( CSB ) at the Universit¨at Stuttgart . Subproject A4 ’4D - spatial - temporal dynamics in cellular signal transduction processes : Modeling , computational analysis and visualization’ aimed at analyzing signal transduction through the crowded intracellular envi - ronment with single molecule detail . As such , it focused on the spatiotemporal distribution of the signaling molecules and their arrival probability at the nucleus [ 144 ] . Based on the work of Lapin et al . [ 165 ] which tracked individual micro - organisms through the turbulent ﬁeld of 2 1 . 2 . Contributions and Aims a stirred bioreactor [ 166 ] , a multi - scale simulation , tracking individual molecules through the cell , was developed . The ﬁrst application tackled the spatio - temporal dynamics of mobile signaling compounds in the MAPK - ( mitogen activated protein kinase ) signaling cascade as well as the speed of the nuclear accumulation of steroid hormone receptors [ 168 ] . Looking at the spatial signal transduction process in the cell made clear , that the actual intracellular properties have to be included in the model . Namely two subjects had to be elucidated for this reason in detail : ( i ) the effective mobility of the signaling molecules which is reduced due to the cytoskeleton structures and crowding molecules [ 182 ] , and ( ii ) the actual in vivo reaction rate constants of the molecular interactions between the signaling compounds [ 75 , 118 ] . Merely as a byproduct of the initial aim focusing at signal transduction processes , the devel - oped simulation is also able to model and analyze these intracellular properties under various conditions . This affects not only signal transduction but in principle any biochemical process in the cell and therefore deserves a closer attention also with respect to metabolic reactions [ 191 ] and the pharmacokinetics of drug molecules in vivo [ 226 ] . Within the main focus of this work – signal transduction in the MAPK - cascade – the effects of the spatial organization in the cell are further analyzed . Namely : 1 . The spatial component is added to a present MAPK - signaling model parametrized by Fujioka et al . [ 89 ] . 2 . The inﬂuence of different reaction diffusion parameters as well as nonsymmetrical cel - lular architectures is explored , which extends the analysis of Kholodenko et al . [ 147 ] . 3 . The effect of motorized transport of signaling proteins as suggested by Kholodenko [ 143 ] was tested successfully . Subproject A4 of the CSB work package also aimed at visualizing the multitude of events in signal transduction . The simulation already contains the positional information of all signal - ing molecules and likewise they can be visualized at any time point . Furthermore the path or the local density of molecules can be calculated while focus and context methods help to navigate through the cell [ 77 , 78 ] . The high number of signaling molecules and time steps handled in the simulation requires a special visualization framework in order to achieve a truly interactive visualization . Martin Falk ( VIS , Universit¨at of Stuttgart ) , developed this valuable visualization tool in close collaboration to the present work . The combined simulation and visualization framework leads to a detailed insight into the cell with a nearly unlimited resolution – given that the model of the underlying biophysical pro - cesses is implemented correctly and thoroughly [ 276 ] . Thus this work can help to boost the knowledge about the natural processes within the cell – and beyond . 3 1 . INTRODUCTION Subproject A3 ’Quantitative analysis and modeling of membrane trafﬁcking steps within the endocytosis pathway of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae’ targeted the endocytosis of the Ste2p receptor in mating yeast . In order to simulate the endocytic vesicle transport , the agent - based simulation method was extended to track vesicle - objects through the virtual cell . In addition , a detailed mechanistic model was developed to describe the budding and fusion of vesicles based on the reactions of molecules of the vesicle machinery . Also , the reactions occurring within the vesicles are included in a multi - scale approach . The agent - based simulation of vesicle transport in three dimensions revealed the crucial ne - cessity to deﬁne and to resolve the underlying transport network for the directed vesicle trans - port . While the overall structure of the cytoskeleton and membrane trafﬁcking network as well as many of the contributing molecular interactions are known , the detailed spatial and dynamic organization of the network is unknown . In this work the current knowledge of the cytoskeleton architecture , the cytoskeleton and membrane compartment co - localization and the vesicle formation and transport processes have been integrated into one model . This model shows possible principles of the organization of the membrane trafﬁcking network and its integration into the cellular architecture . 1 . 3 Thesis Outline While this chapter compiles the framework of the thesis , Chapter 2 introduces the background of the complex intracellular environment . This includes the explanation of the signal trans - duction process as well as the reaction and transport processes involved . Chapter 3 reviews the current modeling and simulation techniques , focusing on simulations that are capable of dealing with the requested modeling detail and the spatial and temporal dimensions of signal transduction in the cell . The simulation developed for this thesis is described in Chapter 4 . Applications and results of the simulation are presented in the next ﬁve chapters . Chapter 5 shows the impact of the intracellular conditions on the mobility and the reaction rate of the molecules . In Chapter 6 the simulation is applied to signal transduction – including the com - plex intracellular conditions and the spatial aspects of the signal transmission process . Chap - ter 7 contains the simulation results of a complete signal transduction cascade . The transport of vesicles and the structural and spatial properties of the membrane trafﬁcking network in the cell are presented in Chapter 8 . Chapter 9 outlines the interplay of signaling and vesicle transport in the cell based on receptor mediated endocytosis . At the end the work presented in this thesis is summarized in Chapter 10 , which includes the conclusions and the outlook . 4 Chapter 2 Cellular Architecture , Transport , Reactions , and Signaling This chapter provides an introduction into the intracellular conditions , biophysical properties , and regulatory processes involved with signal transduction . 2 . 1 Signal Transduction Signal transduction describes the multitude of intracellular processes that adjust the state of the cell to an external stimulus ( see Figure 2 . 1 ) [ 3 , 178 ] . Two principal ways can be distinguished . 1 . The external signal - molecule binds as a ligand to a membrane bound receptor at the plasma membrane of the cell . The receptor protein itself extends through the membrane and is activated by the binding of the ligand - for instance the conformation of the protein is slightly altered or a dimerization is triggered [ 3 ] . The intracellular part of the activated receptor complex can then activate further signaling molecules in the cell , which eventually promote the desired action - for example the activation of certain genes ( see Figure 2 . 1 ) [ 89 , 217 ] . Examples of this pathway are growth factors like EGF ( epidermal growth factor ) but also the mating pheromone α - factor in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae which binds to the Ste2p receptor [ 157 ] . 2 . Other external signaling molecules can actually move through the plasma membrane and bind to intracellular receptors - either in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus . The nu - clear receptors can then bind to the respective promoter regions at the DNA in order to regulate the respective genes . Examples are the steroid hormones and the correspond - ing steroid hormone receptors [ 168 , 178 ] . The key factor of signal transduction – the transport of the signaling molecules towards the nucleus – will be analyzed in this work . This involves the setup of a spatial model of the cell 5 2 . CELLULAR ARCHITECTURE , TRANSPORT , REACTIONS , AND SIGNALING Figure 2 . 1 : Chemical and physical processes in signal transduction . This work focuses on the translocation process of the active signaling molecules and the modeling of the corresponding dif - fusion / transport through the cell . and the incorporation of the transport processes , especially diffusion . Accordingly , this work focuses on the temporal and spatial patterns that arise during signal transduction between the plasma membrane and the nucleus . Signal transduction can be a rather complex process as in the case of EGF where many different pathways are activated and many intermediary compounds connect the receptor with the ﬁnal gene regulation [ 37 , 217 ] . The principle interactions in these networks are ( i ) the activation of signaling compounds , e . g . a phosphorylation of the molecule by a kinase and ( ii ) the deactivation or inhibition of signaling compounds , e . g . the corresponding dephosphorylation by a phosphatase . A common motif in signal transduction is the MAPK - ( Mitogen activated protein kinase ) - cascade . MAPK itself is activated by another kinase ( MAPKK ) which itself is activated by a further kinase ( MAPKKK ) , which is activated by the signaling complex at the plasma membrane . All of these kinases can be deactivated by phosphatases . This motif is found for example in the EGF pathway , where the respective components are Raf , Mek , and Erk [ 89 , 217 ] but also in yeast ( Ste2p receptor , Ste11 , Ste7 , and Fus3 respectively ) [ 157 ] . Of course , both the activators and deactivators can be activated and deactivated itself . The resulting complex network structures enable an astonishingly powerful regulation . They are robust in the sense that they can also handle many different and even mutually contradictory signals at once [ 134 ] . Adaptation processes also assure that the pathway is always sensitive to a change in the signal strength [ 3 ] . In general , the output of the system depends on the arrangement of the feed - forward and feedback loops in the interaction network as well as the strength of the interactions [ 31 , 145 , 6 2 . 2 . Events , Stochasticity , and Taking the Average 262 ] . Altogether the interaction network between the signaling compounds can lead to effects like oscillations , ultrasensitivity , bistability and switches , as well as sustained signaling [ 52 , 73 , 189 ] . Signaling pathways are a promising target for instance in the treatment of cancer [ 97 ] – especially in the reduction of the overstimulated growth signal [ 126 , 270 ] and the activation of apoptosis via ’death’ receptors [ 61 ] . 2 . 2 Events , Stochasticity , and Taking the Average At the level of one cell , the number of signaling molecules can be too low to assume a con - tinuous state . Rather the discrete molecules and events have to be recognized . This holds especially for genes that are regulated by the signaling process : either a gene is activated – or it is not . Considering cell death , for example the aforementioned apoptosis , this has to be further emphasized : either the cell is alive – or it dies . In the context of bistable signaling in the apoptosis pathway reported by Eissing et al . [ 73 ] , this leads to a ﬁnal and binary decision . The single event triggering the decision is the one that counts . Still , it has to be evaluated in context of all other events in the complex system . Also in the MAPK - cascade the stochasticity can play a role . Morishita et al . [ 207 ] showed that a stochastic model leads to a different result in the dynamics of signal transduction than a deterministic model . The ﬂuctuations in the instationary and non - equilibrium states can – on average – lead to a stronger signal by an enhanced triggering of the molecules of the next stage of the signaling cascade . Cai et al . [ 44 ] also reported a frequency modulation of the noisy presence of transcription factors , which according to their model allows the concerted regulation of multiple target genes over a wide dynamic range . Therefore and in order to model signal transduction realistically , the stochasticity caused by low particle numbers should be incorporated in the model [ 99 , 103 , 307 ] . In addition , the spatial aspects should be taken into account . Namely , the stochasticity of the random walk of the signaling molecules on their way to the target . In case of stochastic models every trial or every cell will differ . The randomness of the process causes a distribution of states . This leads to the following questions : will the mean value of the discrete and stochastic model be the same as the outcome of the continuous deterministic model ? And does the mean value actually tell the truth ? Certainly it is not sufﬁcient to look at just one individual cell [ 130 ] . The complete distribution has to be considered instead . If the distribution of cells is not unimodal , i . e . there exists for example a peak for the cells that are in the healthy and living state and one ( smaller ) peak for the cells that are going to die within the next minutes , obviously by taking the average both peaks will be mixed into an unreal partly living state [ 322 ] . The fact that actually the mean and moreover the expectation value in a unimodal distribution will differ from those obtained by a deterministic analysis 7 2 . CELLULAR ARCHITECTURE , TRANSPORT , REACTIONS , AND SIGNALING might depend on the parameters . A simple rule that predicts the differences does not exist . It is also worth noting , that small differences can also arise from numerical errors or shortcom - ings of the method / model in complex and nonlinear models . Nonlinearity and complexity , in turn , prevent the calculation of an exact solution . 2 . 3 Intracellular Conditions : Crowding and Structures Each of the signaling molecules occupies a speciﬁc volume in the cell . Considering also all other proteins , molecules , cytoskeleton - structures , and even organelles , the intracellular conditions become quite complex , crowded , and simultaneously astonishingly structured as shown in Figure 2 . 2 [ 105 , 182 , 184 , 192 ] . In total , up to 30 % of the cellular volume is occupied by macromolecules [ 75 , 182 ] . As such the cytoplasm fundamentally differs from highly diluted mixtures mostly used in in vitro assays to investigate the properties of enzymes and bio - reactions . The molecular crowding affects reaction rates and the folding of proteins [ 75 , 329 , 333 ] . The decreased dissociation rate constants of enzyme complexes ( ﬁguratively , they are squeezed together in crowded con - ditions ) can for instance control metabolic ﬂuxes in the cell [ 259 ] . Due to the reduced available volume also the mobility of molecules is reduced [ 70 , 182 , 196 , 205 ] . The inﬂuence on the mobility or the reactions , in turn , can be used to probe the lo - cal structures and properties [ 69 ] . These effects also have to be taken into account when analyzing signal transduction in the cell . Therefore , a comprehensive study of the effects is presented in Chapter 5 . 2 . 3 . 1 Cytoskeleton , Microtrabecular Lattice , and Protein Complexes The main structure that organizes the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells is the cytoskeleton . It is constructed of long polymers , namely microtubules ( diameter ≈ 25 nm ) , intermediate ﬁl - aments ( 10 nm ) , and actin ﬁlaments ( 7 nm . Altogether they form a complex and highly reg - ulated network [ 3 ] . The volume fraction of the cytoskeleton building blocks accounts only for about 3 % of the cell volume [ 182 ] . The structure of the cytoskeleton depends on the cell type , the cell cycle state and the species . It provides stability and the spatial organization for the cell but also a network of tracks for directed transport processes with motor proteins . The cytoskeleton structure is adjusted to the function in a self assembly process [ 288 ] . The concept of the microtrabecular lattice extends the cytoskeleton by all kinds of proteins that are bound to it [ 222 ] . The volume fraction of the microtrabecular lattice was measured in kidney cells analyzing high voltage electron micrograph images and reported to be between 15 and 21 % [ 95 ] , which is much larger than the volume fraction of the cytoskeleton building blocks . This means , that the majority of proteins in the cell is either transiently or perma - 8 2 . 3 .

Goodsell . nently bound to the cytoskeleton . For example the correlation of protein interactions on the scale of the entire proteome reveals a signiﬁcant connection between signaling molecules and the cytoskeleton [ 85 ] . This corre - lation might be due to the organization and co - localization of signaling proteins in scaffolds attached to the membrane and / or the cytoskeleton in order to improve signal transduction [ 16 , 33 , 151 , 197 ] . Besides the possibly improved processing of signals , the condensation of proteins into the structures of the microtrabecular lattice has a further effect : since a fraction of the proteins is sequestered from the cytosol , it becomes less crowded [ 223 , 227 ] . In turn , the mobility in the cytoplasm is increased because a few large structures exert a smaller hin - dering inﬂuence on the diffusing molecules than many small obstacles [ 152 , 287 ] . In this context also the work of Pollack [ 241 ] has to be mentioned . He pointed out that the cytoplasm is rather a solid gel than a liquid solution because of the charged and structured surface of the cytoskeleton ﬁlaments and the polar water molecules . This leads to the immo - bilization and redistribution of ions , proteins and molecules in the vicinity of the cytoskeleton ( if it is not temporarily restructured ) , which could also explain many electrophysiological and structural properties of the cells [ 241 ] . 2 . 3 . 2 Compartmentalization and the Vesicle Network Besides the ’microcompartmentation’ introduced by the co - localization of molecules that be - long together in scaffolds or clusters [ 192 ] , eukaryotic cells are further subdivided into spe - cialized compartments like the nucleus , mitochondria and membrane enclosed organelles – the vesicles , which form a special reaction environment . The formation of vesicles precisely sorts and transports molecules to several distinct target locations in the cell [ 3 , 66 , 105 ] . This 9 2 . CELLULAR ARCHITECTURE , TRANSPORT , REACTIONS , AND SIGNALING process is also depicted in Figure 2 . 2 . The complete membrane trafﬁcking and vesicle net - work ( including the Golgi and the ER for instance ) is presented in Chapter 8 . Rafelski and Marshall [ 248 ] have lined out principle rules by which the cell could regulate the number of compartments so that it contains exactly one nucleus and a well deﬁned number of mitochondria , etc . – all at the right location in the cell . It is worth noting , that all structures have to dynamically emerge from self assembly processes in the cell . 2 . 4 Transport and Location While biochemical reactions affect the number of molecules carrying the signal , transport processes are needed to deliver these molecules to their targets on various locations in the cell . Mostly the target will be the nucleus , where the signaling molecules trigger the ex - pression of certain genes [ 143 ] . The subcellular localization of the molecules can in turn determine the output of the signaling cascade [ 114 ] . Some signaling cascades could involve the active , directed transportation of signaling molecules along the cytoskeleton by motor proteins [ 143 , 268 ] , which can improve ﬁrst passage times compared to free , undirected dif - fusion [ 274 ] 1 . However , in most cases the translocation of the signaling molecules depends on undirected diffusion in the cell [ 142 ] . If the signaling molecules have only a limited life - time and are not initially co - localized , the necessary transport time towards each other will limit the interactions between the molecules [ 16 ] . Likewise the regulation of the crosstalk between different signaling pathways requires the speciﬁc colocalization or separation of dif - ferent signaling molecules [ 33 , 134 ] . 2 . 4 . 1 Diffusion and the Inﬂuence of the Intracellular Conditions Diffusion is the macroscopic outcome of the stochastic Brownian motion of individual mole - cules . For normal diffusion the mean squared displacement of the molecules increases linearly with time t and the diffusion coefﬁcient D , and also depends on the dimension d [ 305 , 311 ] : (cid:10) ( (cid:126)x ( t ) − (cid:126)x ( t 0 ) ) 2 (cid:11) = 2 d × D × ( t − t 0 ) ( 2 . 1 ) 1 Facilitated Transport and Cytoplasmic Streaming : Some reactions in the cell are astonishingly fast despite the hindering crowding inﬂuences . Therefore a facilitated transport of hardly soluble molecules by special proteins is discussed [ 334 ] . In addition , transport by motor proteins could be involved [ 180 , 268 ] . Beyond the directed transport of individual molecules and organelles along the cytoskeleton with motor proteins the concepts of cytoplasmic streaming was introduced [ 162 , 241 , 278 ] . A dynamic convective ﬂow of the cytosol is suggested , which depends on the collective action of motor proteins and the cytoskeleton . This ﬂow perfuses the complex cellular architecture and enhances the transport of reactants towards each other [ 32 , 122 , 327 ] . 10 2 . 5 . Diffusion - Limited Reactions The microscopic and heterogeneous cellular architecture has a hindering inﬂuence on diffu - sion [ 67 ] , meaning that the diffusion coefﬁcient is reduced . The network leads to a sieving effect , larger molecules are hindered in their diffusion to a greater extent , and eventually a caging effect restricts the mobility of large objects ( e . g . vesicles ) to pores of the cytoskeleton or sub - compartments in the cell [ 152 , 181 ] . The in vivo mobility can be experimentally determined using ﬂuorescence recovery after pho - tobleaching ( FRAP ) or ﬂuorescence correlation spectroscopy ( FCS ) methods [ 67 ] , conﬁrming the size dependent hindrance of diffusion in the cell [ 63 , 139 , 182 , 273 , 316 ] . The cytoskele - ton can be disassembled using speciﬁc chemical agents in order to measure the effects of the different ﬁber types separately . Luby - Phelps [ 182 ] found that intermediate ﬁlaments had the strongest effect on diffusion . Potma et al . [ 243 ] estimated that the effect of the actin ﬁlament network in dictyostelium cells accounted for 53 % of the hindrance in diffusion . In addition to the ( ﬁxed ) cytoskeleton structure the cell is crowded by myriads of other ( mo - bile ) molecules . These unbound crowding molecules cannot lead to a sieving or caging effect like the cytoskeleton matrix . Due to the mobility of the obstacles , eventually a hole in the cage will open and release the enclosed tracer molecule . Naturally the medium affects not only the translational but also the rotational diffusion [ 169 ] . Molecular crowding can in addition lead to subdiffusion [ 13 , 22 , 46 ] . In this case Equa - tion ( 2 . 1 ) does not hold , the mean squared displacement of tracer molecules (cid:104) ( (cid:126)x ( t ) − (cid:126)x ( t 0 ) ) 2 (cid:105) grows only ∝ t α with α < 1 . 0 . In general , α = 1 refers to normal diffusion and any other case to anomalous diffusion . The level of subdiffusion depends on the level of crowding [ 324 ] . Eventually also a binding process to cellular structures affects the mobility [ 95 , 132 ] . Bio - molecules can unspeciﬁcly bind to other molecules in the cell . Especially if the molecules are bound to immobile structures like the cytoskeleton , transient binding will lead to a further reduction of the mobility on top of the already reduced diffusion in the cell [ 28 , 95 , 183 , 263 ] . Transient binding can also lead to anomalous diffusion [ 263 ] . 2 . 5 Diffusion - Limited Reactions The mobility of the molecules is a prerequisite for all reactions . Only if two molecules come close enough they can react with each other . Since mobility in the microscopic world mostly relies on diffusion , this is referred to as diffusion - limited reactions [ 252 ] . Smoluchowski [ 280 ] derived the reaction rate for coagulation ( the agglomeration / clustering of colloidal par - ticles ) , for the case where every collision of diffusing molecules leads to a reaction ( cluster - ing ) . In 3D , the corresponding reaction rate constant is k D = 4 π ( r i + r j ) ( D i + D j ) ( 2 . 2 ) 11 2 . CELLULAR ARCHITECTURE , TRANSPORT , REACTIONS , AND SIGNALING As such , no reaction can be faster than k D . In general , not every collision will lead to a reaction . The fraction of collisions that lead to a collision can be described with the rate constant k micro in this detailed , microscopic description [ 58 ] . k micro = 0 means that the molecules will not react with each other – they are inert . If k micro → ∞ the macroscopic reaction rate will equal the rate of collisions and thus k D . In this framework the ( asymptotic ) effective , macroscopic reaction rate constant which is used in mass action kinetic models can be derived based on the collision rate constant k D and the microscopic rate constant k micro [ 252 , 279 ] : 1 k macro = 1 k D + 1 k micro ( 2 . 3 ) In many cases the diffusion and therefore the rate of collisions is large enough to neglect the diffusion - limited nature of the reaction ( k D (cid:29) k micro ⇒ k macro → k micro ) . Within the complex in vivo conditions , however , it has to be considered . Especially molecular crowding and the reduced or even anomalous mobility of the molecules can have a tremendous effect on intracellular reaction rates [ 22 , 75 , 206 , 266 ] . Since the displacement of a diffusing particle depends on the dimensionality of the media , the collision probability and subsequently the reaction rate depends on the dimension as well [ 21 , 300 ] . Accordingly , Equations ( 2 . 2 ) and ( 2 . 3 ) do not hold in two dimensions [ 300 ] . 2 . 6 Conclusion for the Present Work The present work aims at developing a detailed simulation environment , which allows mod - eling the spatiotemporal dynamics of signal transduction in 3D . It should especially include and elucidate • the coupling of the reaction and diffusion process • the inﬂuence of the structure of the cell ( cytoskeleton , molecular crowding ) • and the stochasticity of the single events involved with each reaction . 12 Chapter 3 Models and Simulations : State of the Art This chapter summarizes the current modeling and simulation techniques that are used for a systematic description of signal transduction processes and the intracellular properties . It will also address the speciﬁc applications of individual simulation techniques and the challenges within each topic , especially concerning stochastic models . The short review also focuses on the integration of the different models into a predictive , holistic , and systems oriented simulation environment and the visualization of the results . 3 . 1 Modeling Signal Transduction with Differential Equations In general , the dynamics in the number of active signaling molecules of species i is tracked based on ordinary differential equations ( ODE ) : dc i dt = activating reactions (cid:88) l r l , i − deactivating reactions (cid:88) m r m , i ( 3 . 1 ) This approach requires one balance equation for each molecule species – and assumes well - mixed , spatially homogeneous conditions . The number of reactions and their kinetics is given by the model structure [ 157 , 188 ] . The corresponding set of ( coupled ) ODEs can be solved starting from given initial conditions with standard techniques / software , e . g . MATLAB . Figure 3 . 1 ( a ) shows the principle of the MAPK ( Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase ) - pathway as introduced in Section 2 . 1 and the corresponding ODE model . MAPK can be phospho - rylated ( = activated ) by the corresponding upstream kinase . The active form MAPKp can likewise be dephosphorylated ( = deactivated ) by a phosphatase . It can be assumed , that the upstream part of this signal transduction cascade is ﬁxed in a scaf - fold at the plasma membrane [ 37 ] . Only the ﬁnal species MAPK is mobile in this model and 13 3 . MODELS AND SIMULATIONS : STATE OF THE ART Figure 3 . 1 : ( a ) MAPK cascade model ( e . g . for EGF . . . , Raf , MEK , and ERK ) and the corresponding set of differential equations . The reactions are based on mass action kinetics . ( b ) Emergence of gradients in a spatial model . ( c ) Concentration proﬁle of the mobile signaling molecules MAPKp in a PDE model with Damk¨ohler number Da = 5 . carries the signal to the nucleus . This means , that it is activated only at the plasma membrane but deactivated everywhere in the cell by phosphatases 1 . This will lead to a gradient in the distribution of active MAPKp molecules , which have to reach the nucleus in order to transmit the signal ( see Figure 3 . 1b ) . A gradient is however not compliant with the well - mixed condi - tion required for ODE models . Accordingly Kholodenko [ 143 ] has suggested the use of partial differential equations ( PDE ) which include the spatial aspects . This concept was also included in the ’Virtual Cell’ of 1 In contrast , also all molecule species of the cascade can be treated as mobile , and in addition feed - back / feedforward loops can be included in the model , which leads to different activation patterns in time and space [ 144 , 146 , 189 ] . 14 3 . 1 . Modeling Signal Transduction with Differential Equations Schaff et al . [ 265 ] . The balance equation for the active MAPKp molecules becomes [ 168 ] ∂c ( r , t ) ∂t = D 1 r 2 ∂ ∂r r 2 ∂c ( r , t ) ∂r − k × c ( r , t ) ( 3 . 2 ) where D is the diffusion coefﬁcient of this molecule species and k is the apparent reaction rate constant of the deactivation by phosphatases ( i . e . k 6 c phos in Figure 3 . 1a ) . Note , that a spherical symmetric cell is assumed . The result depends on the chosen boundary conditions . For instance the conditions c ( r , t ) | r = R n = 0 ; D ∂c ( r , t ) ∂r (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) r = R cell = F 0 ; c ( r , t = 0 ) = 0 ( 3 . 3 ) describe a constant ﬂux F 0 of active MAPKp molecules into the cell , starting from the plasma membrane at R cell where they are activated , and a completely absorbing nucleus at R n ( i . e . all MAPKp molecules which reach the nucleus enter the nucleus ) . For these conditions the analytical solution for the steady state distribution of Equation ( 3 . 2 ) becomes [ 164 ] c ( r ) = F 0 ( R cell − R n ) D sinh (cid:16) √ Da ( r − R n ) / R cell (cid:17) κ cosh ( κ ) − ( R cell − R n ) / R cell sinh ( κ ) ( 3 . 4 ) with κ = √ Da ( R cell − R n ) R cell ( 3 . 5 ) where Da = k × R 2 cell D ( 3 . 6 ) is the ( second order ) Damk ¨ ohler number . It relates the reaction time constant with the trans - port time constant , i . e . the reaction rate constant with the size of the cell and the diffusion coefﬁcient . Da is a dimensionless variable and facilitates the comparison e . g . of different cells . The relation of the transport and reaction rate constant determines the gradient in the concentration of active signaling molecules in the cell - and the number of signaling molecules which eventually can enter the nucleus . In general , the gradient in c ( r ) will be steeper for a higher Da [ 167 ] . Figure 3 . 1 ( c ) shows the concentration proﬁle for Da = 5 . 3 . 1 . 1 Nucleo - Cytoplasmic Shuttling Detailed models also include the compartmentalization of the cell . In addition to the trans - port through space , which is goverened by diffusion ( diffusion coefﬁcient D ) , this requires to deﬁne transport rates accross the borders of the compartments . In the model of signal transduction this holds especially for the nucleo - cytoplasmic shuttling of signaling molecules ( from the cytoplasm into the nucleus and vice versa ) . 15 3 . MODELS AND SIMULATIONS : STATE OF THE ART Allthough the nuclear import can be a complex process 2 , it is mostly described by a simple kinetic , for instance a ﬁrst order mass action kinetic ’import’ rate constant k import [ 89 ] . dc MAPKp , cytopl . dt = · · · − k import c MAPKp , cytopl . + k export c MAPKp , nucl . ( 3 . 7 ) dc MAPKp , nucl . dt = · · · + k import c MAPKp , cytopl . − k export c MAPKp , nucl . ( 3 . 8 ) The nuclear import rate likewise determines the number of signaling molecules which enter the nucleus – even in ODE models that do not include the transport of signaling molecules through space . In PDE models , the formalism has to be transfered from a ’reaction’ into a ﬂux and deﬁned in the boundary conditions of the cytoplasm at the boundary to the nucleus [ 261 ] : D ∂c MAPKp , cytopl . ( r , t ) ∂r (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) (cid:12) r = R n = k (cid:48) import c MAPKp , cytopl . ( r , t ) (cid:12)(cid:12) r = R n ( 3 . 9 ) The ﬂux into the nucleus accordingly depends on the concentration next to the surface , the import rate constant k (cid:48) import , the diffusion coefﬁcient D , and the surface of the nucleus 4 πR 2 n . 3 . 2 Spatial Modeling and the Cellular Structure PDE models include the spatial aspects of the cell but assume a homogeneous structure of the intracellular space . As shown in the previous chapter , the cytoplasm is however structured by the cytoskeleton and crowded by macromolecules . These microscopic properties should be included in a detailed model of signal transduction [ 254 , 289 ] . In addition , the hindrance in the diffusion process must be considered , in order to model the signal transduction process realistically . This section reviews the models which are used to quantify the hindrance in the diffusion due to the ( ﬁxed ) cytoskeleton structures and ( mobile ) crowding molecules . The most important factor is the excluded volume fraction , which is explained below . 3 . 2 . 1 Excluded and Free Volume Fraction The excluded volume fraction (cid:15) describes the fraction of the volume from which the center of mobile test or tracer molecules is excluded [ 205 , 305 , 328 ] . Since the tracer molecules have a size as well , the excluded volume fraction (cid:15) exceeds the volume fraction of the crowding objects and depends on the radius of the tracer molecules . As shown in Figure 3 . 2 , the ex - 2 In general , nuclear import and export can be highly regulated [ 242 ] , involve several pathwys [ 193 ] , and importin proteins [ 179 ] . 16 3 . 2 . Spatial Modeling and the Cellular Structure Figure 3 . 2 : Obstacles in a regular lat - tice and a random setup and the cor - responding excluded volume for small and large test molecules . The ob - stacles can overlap in the random ar - rangement . The setup down right ex - empliﬁes the emergence of cages that can trap mobile test particles . cluded volume of nonoverlapping crowding spheres can overlap if the tracer spheres are large enough . Figure 3 . 2 also shows , that a random distribution of crowding molecules can lead to cages that can trap tracer molecules . Simultaneously it opens channels through the random media , while the ordered structure is completely impenetrable . This fact is reﬂected in the percolation threshold of the structure [ 244 ] . Since the volume can only be excluded or free , the free volume fraction φ = 1 − (cid:15) . 3 . 2 . 2 Hindered Diffusion by the Cytoskeleton In a ﬁrst approach , the cytoskeleton can be seen as a rigid network comparable to porous me - dia . Averaging over the microscopic structure leads to macroscopic properties from which the hindrance on diffusion can be calculated by volume averaging [ 328 ] . The relative effective diffusion D eff / D 0 is related to the free volume fraction φ . Maxwell’s approach for conduc - tion through heterogeneous media [ 194 ] provides a ﬁrst estimation for the hindered diffusion through the heterogeneous cytoskeleton [ 325 ] : D eff D 0 = φ 1 + 1 / 2 ( 1 − φ ) ( 3 . 10 ) Weissberg [ 325 ] calculated a more detailed upper limit for D eff / D 0 for overlapping spheres D eff D 0 < φ 1 − 0 . 5 ln ( φ ) ( 3 . 11 ) and Trinh et al . [ 305 ] showed that it agrees well with Monte Carlo simulations of diffusion through porous media . In addition , a multitude of empirical formulas or approximations have been developed up to now to describe the hindrance in diffusion [ 6 , 60 , 112 , 213 , 218 ] . Blum et al . [ 28 ] were the ﬁrst to estimate the effect of the cytoskeleton on diffusion . How - 17 3 . MODELS AND SIMULATIONS : STATE OF THE ART ever , an analytical solution for the diffusion through the cytoskeleton was only possible in a regular lattice structure . Otherwise the complicated boundary conditions render a solution impossible . Monte Carlo simulations on the particle level facilitate more realistic geometries [ 152 ] . A particle based model to analyze diffusion through the cellular structures was ﬁrst used by ¨Olveczky and Verkman [ 220 ] and later in the software environment of ’Smoldyn’ , but only using plates or cubes as ﬁxed obstacles [ 175 ] . Nowadays also realistic and detailed geometries can be modeled and analyzed [ 152 , 216 ] . It is worth noting , that the hindrance does not only depend on the properties of the obstacles like the pore size but especially on the size and conformation of the diffusing macromolecule [ 238 ] . While rigid bodies cannot adjust their shape , ﬂexible or chain - like polymers such as DNA or RNA can wriggle and squeeze themselves through small pores of the network [ 50 ] . These facts render the use of the above mentioned formulas impractical for the calculation of the actual hindrance in the diffusion in a realistic cytoskeleton structure . 3 . 2 . 3 Hindered Diffusion by Molecular Crowding Since the crowding molecules are not arranged in a ﬁxed structure but uniformly distributed in the cell , an average and spatially homogeneous effect on the diffusion of the tracer particles can be assumed . Molecular crowding increases the effective viscosity of the cytosol η cytosol compared to water with η 0 . Based on the Stokes - Einstein - relation the effective diffusion is then reduced to D eff D 0 = η 0 η cytosol ( 3 . 12 ) A value of D eff / D 0 = 0 . 37 corresponds to a viscosity of about 2 . 7 cP , which is in agreement with the measured cytosolic viscosity [ 182 ] . However , it should be noted that the local mi - croviscosity acting on the probe molecule is not necessarily concordant with the macroscopic viscosity of the cytosol [ 79 , 102 ] . Several analytic or empiric approaches try to describe the diffusion in the complex environ - ment comparable to the cytosol [ 60 , 161 , 235 , 236 ] . Based on these models and the diffusion in Swiss 3T3 ﬁbroblasts Luby - Phelps and Weisiger [ 183 ] found the empiric relationship D crowdingeff / D 0 = exp ( − 0 . 035 · 124 0 . 64 · r 0 . 16 tracer ) ( 3 . 13 ) In order to understand the inﬂuence of molecular crowding in the cell for several intracellular conditions , detailed simulations are required , in which all molecules are tracked . The mobility and especially the immense number of the crowding molecules increases the computational effort in a simulation . Currently different groups are developing methods towards realistic modeling of the complex interactions introduced by macromolecular crowding e . g . [ 46 , 54 , 87 , 196 , 254 , 264 , 287 , 296 , 323 , 324 , 329 ] . 18 3 . 3 . Modeling with Single Molecule Detail 3 . 3 Modeling with Single Molecule Detail It is at least questionable , whether the number of signaling molecules is sufﬁciently high in order to assume a continuum as it is required for ODE / PDE models . This work aims at describing the whole cell at a resolution of single signaling molecules , including the intrinsic stochasticity of the corresponding events . In addition also the microscopic structure of the cell will be taken into account [ 289 ] . It is worth noting , that Equations ( 3 . 10 ) and ( 3 . 11 ) do not show a radius dependent hindrance in the diffusion explicitly . Therefore a detailed simulation is required , which tracks individual molecules through a realistic cellular architecture . 3 . 3 . 1 Stochastic Reactions and the Gillespie Algorithm In general , reactions change the number of the involved molecule species . These changes can be tracked with the stochastic master equation [ 110 ] . Gillespie [ 99 ] derived a fast simulation method to solve the master equation for chemical reactions . A possible explanation derived from the ODE model of Equation ( 3 . 1 ) looks as follows : • instead of tracking concentrations the number N i of molecules of species i is tracked ( here subject to a ﬁrst order decay / deactivation reaction ) : dN i dt = − k i N i ( 3 . 14 ) • The discretized equation ( to ﬁrst order in dt ) is then ∆ N i ∆ t = − k i N i ( 3 . 15 ) • ∆ N states the ( average ) number of reactions that occur during ∆ t . Since we are inter - ested in descrete molecules and events , we can set ∆ N : = − 1 and replace ∆ t by ∆ t 1 , the average time until the next reaction will occur : 1 ∆ t 1 = k i N i ( 3 . 16 ) • Instead of executing the next reaction at the time ∆ t 1 , the time can rather be calculated based on the stochastic properties of the reaction process . For reactions the stochastic waiting time τ has to be estimated based on the exponential distribution . In general , the dynamics of more than one molecule species / reaction is tracked in the model . The stochastic time until the next reaction will occur in the model is then given by τ = 1 a × ln 1 ξ 1 with a : = (cid:88) i a i : = (cid:88) i k i N i ( 3 . 17 ) 19 3 . MODELS AND SIMULATIONS : STATE OF THE ART Figure 3 . 3 : Spatial extension of the Gillespie method in a grid : in addition to reactions between molecules of a sub - volume also jumps between the subvolumes have to be tracked to account for diffusion . Simulation results from Stundzia and Lumsden [ 286 ] show the discretized space ( reprinted with permission from Elsevier ) . where ξ 1 is a random number from the uniform distribution in the unit interval . It is converted into the exponential distribution by the ln function . • In addition the concerned reaction i needs to be speciﬁed . The corresponding proba - bility that it will be reaction i is proportional to a i / a . Gillespie [ 99 ] suggested to sum up the different a i values until the sum equals or exceeds the value a × ξ 2 , where ξ 2 is another random number from the uniform distriubtion . The current index i then deter - mines the reaction that is executed at τ . Execution of the reaction means to change the involved molecule number ( s ) N i according to the reaction scheme . • Finally the time is set to t + τ and the next τ and index i of the reaction is calculated based on the current molecule numbers as described above . • These steps are repeated until the desired endpoint of the simulation is reached . This method is also called the next reaction method because the algorithm jumps through continuous time towards the next reaction . Since the algorithm samples only one track of events out of all possibilities , it has to be applied several times in order to acquire the actual distribution given by the master equation . The Gillespie approach assumes spatial homogeneous or well mixed conditions because the spatial aspects are neglected . However , the spatial component is important in the cell , espe - cially in signal transduction as outlined above [ 68 , 143 , 289 , 290 ] . Space can be added in the framework of the Gillespie algorithm by introducing small subvolumes [ 74 ] . The motion of the molecules due to diffusion through space means that molecules will move into another subvolume from time to time ( see Figure 3 . 3 ) . In the probabilistic framework , this leads to a ’reaction’ , in which the molecule changes its subvolume . Accordingly , Stundzia and Lums - den [ 286 ] have developed an extended Gillespie method which could also be called the ’next subvolume method’ . In each subvolume the Gillespie algorithm is running , assuming a ho - mogeneous environment , while the subvolumes are linked via the aforementioned transport reaction . This approach has been applied for example by Hattne et al . [ 117 ] in the MesoRD 20 3 . 3 . Modeling with Single Molecule Detail framework and by Ander et al . [ 7 ] in SmartCell . Figure 3 . 3 shows , that space is discrete and that the spatial resolution of the method is accordingly limited . 3 . 3 . 2 Particle Tracking in 3D and a Structured Cell As pointed out in Section 2 . 4 . 1 , the crowded and structured intracellular conditions lead to a reduced mobility of the molecules . In addition , it can affect the reaction rates . Since the molecules in the spatial Gillespie method are treated as point particles , only their number is tracked but not their volume . Therefor the effects of molecular crowding cannot be accessed with these methods [ 289 ] . In contrast , the motion of individual molecules can be tracked through space , for instance based on a Brownian Dynamics simulation . The latter approach allows to insert a model cytoskeleton into the cell . Also mobile crowding molecules can be included . The model cytoskeleton can be created by simple geometric objects like cylinders ( for cytoskeleton ﬁl - aments ) and spheres ( for macromolecules ) ( cf . Section 4 . 1 . 1 ) [ 152 ] . Figure 3 . 4 shows a comparison between the model cell and the corresponding in vivo structures , which were ex - perimentally obtained by Medalia et al . [ 200 ] . Accordingly , the molecules in the simulation have to move around the obstacles which reduces their diffusion as it does in the cell . Thus the reduced effective diffusion effect can be modeled correctly [ 216 ] . Figure 3 . 4 : Comparison of the 3D intracellular structures : in vivo ( left ) and in silico ( right ) cytoskeleton . The 815 × 870 × 97 nm section shows actin ﬁlaments and ribosomes . The in vivo image is reprinted from Medalia et al . [ 200 ] with permission from AAAS . The structures in the in silico cell are randomly arranged based on a uniform distribution . Actin volume fraction : 8 . 5 % ( modeled by cylinders with diameter of 7 nm and length of 700 nm ) , ’ribosome’ volume fraction : 5 . 8 % ( modeled by spheres with diameter of 20 nm ) . The in silico cell was set up as described in Section 4 . 1 . 1 and visualized with Povray as described in Appendix C . 21 3 . MODELS AND SIMULATIONS : STATE OF THE ART 3 . 3 . 3 Challenges in Particle - Based Simulations In Brownian Dynamic ( BD ) simulations the diffusion of the signaling molecules is modeled by a random force , which leads to the random walk . The solvent ( e . g . myriads of water molecules ) is neglected , which reduces the computational effort compared to more detailed Molecular Dynamics Simulations ( MDS ) . While MDS simulations can cover only small vol - umes and time spans ( yet with a superior resolution and atomic detail ) , with BD simulation modeling of the whole cell becomes possible [ 289 ] . Particle tracking simulations have been employed in order to study signal transduction by several groups [ 8 , 9 , 239 , 303 ] . The challenge of this approach arises from the correct yet performant implementation of the reactions between the molecules [ 8 , 55 , 168 , 239 , 313 ] . In principle , a collision of two reactants leads to a reaction just as in the coagulation model of Smoluchowski [ 280 ] ( therefore the simulation framework of Andrews and Bray [ 8 ] is called ’Smoldyn’ – Smoluchowski dynamics ) . However , the correct translation of the current dis - tance between two molecules into the actual reaction probability , so that the resulting reaction rate matches the diffusion limited reaction rate , turns out to be nontrivial [ 8 , 168 ] : • Mostly , a ﬁxed discrete timestep ∆ t is used . The distance between the molecules can be calculated at the current time t and at the next time point t + ∆ t . But the behavior of the molecules in between these points remains unresolved . • Brownian Bridge : The gap between t and t + ∆ t can be closed for instance with a Brownian bridge . The distance between two diffusing particles is again a random walk with well known properties . The properties of the subset of all paths that start at the initial distance (cid:107) x i ( t ) − x j ( t ) (cid:107) and end at (cid:107) x i ( t + ∆ t ) − x j ( t + ∆ t ) (cid:107) can then be used to calculate the number of molecule pairs which come close enough to react [ 55 ] . • Solution of the Fokker - Planck - Equation : A smaller ∆ t leads to a ﬁner sampling of the original time interval and reveals more collisions at the sampled time . The reaction probability per collision therefore has to be adjusted with ∆ t . In order to obtain this reaction probability the relative motion of molecule j with respect to molecule i can be described with the Fokker - Planck - Equation as shown in Figure 3 . 5 based on the com - bined diffusion coefﬁcient D i + D j [ 167 , 168 , 311 ] and a partially reﬂecting boundary condition at the collision distance r i + r j ( see Figure 3 . 5 e ) [ 252 ] . This approach di - rectly returns the reaction probability within [ t , t + ∆ t ) based on the current distance between i and j ( see Figure 3 . 5 c ) [ 167 , 168 ] . • Green’s - function Reaction Dynamics ( GFRD ) : Likewise GFRD evaluates the reac - tion properties exactly – based on the analytical solution of the Smoluchoswki equation . It allows large ∆ t when the molecules are far apart from each other , but cannot be used in a structured and crowded cell [ 313 ] . 22 3 . 4 . Multiscale - Modeling Figure 3 . 5 : The temporal development of the propability density function for the distance between two diffusing molecules ( a ) is described by the Fokker - Planck - Equation ( d ) . Upon a collision , j can either react with i or it is reﬂected . This is translated into the partially reﬂecting boundary condition at the collision distance ( e ) , based on the reaction rate constant k (cid:48) [ 252 ] . In this description , particles react if they diffuse into the reaction partner , which is accounted by the ﬂux across the collision surface . For k (cid:48) = 0 the boundary condition becomes completely reﬂective , describing the collision between two inert particles . Under the given boundary conditions ( e , f ) the probability density function of the position of the j molecule ( relative to i ) is shown in ( b ) . Note the ’blister’ which deforms the normal distribution at the boundary because of the partial reﬂection . Due to the incomplete reﬂection , the total probability (cid:82) WdV < 1 . The loss is the result of the reaction between i and j . Hence the reaction probability ( c ) for a given initial distance is found as P reactionFokker − Planck = 1 − (cid:82) WdV [ 167 , 168 ] . • In contrast , Andrews and Bray [ 8 ] and Pogson et al . [ 239 ] use simpliﬁcations and intro - duce a critical reaction distance . Particles that are closer than this distance will react . 3 . 4 Multiscale - Modeling Different events in the cell occur at different scales [ 251 ] . For instance macroscopic processes are compiled of a subset of faster microscopoc interactions . Also the complex intracellular environment can lead to shifted effective reaction or diffusion rates which cannot be predicted right away but require special calculations itself [ 118 , 216 ] . Either these effective properties are calculated or measured initially and then plugged into the model , or the calculations are actually coupled with the main simulation framework . The latter becomes necessary in situa - tions where the detailed behavior depends on the current macroscopic situation . This leads to the ﬁeld of hybrid or multi - scale models and simulations [ 224 ] , in which each level is mod - eled and simulated with an optimal approach while still the whole process can be covered in an integrative manner [ 47 , 51 ] . Using a multi - scale approach , systems - oriented modeling even beyond the level of one cell – for instance the development of tissues or bioreactors with many individual ’agent - based’ cells – becomes possible [ 2 , 166 , 185 , 319 ] . 23 3 . MODELS AND SIMULATIONS : STATE OF THE ART 3 . 5 Visualization Ideally model and simulation are accompanied with a corresponding visualization clarifying and highlighting the results [ 228 ] . In the context of a detailed particle tracking simulation , the path of individual signaling molecules can be highlighted , exemplifying the signal transduc - tion from the plasma membrane towards the nucleus [ 77 , 175 ] . Within the densely crowded environment of the ( virtual ) cell , signaling molecules move and interact in a stochastic , un - predictable manner . This requires an interactive visualization guiding the eye through the cell towards the events of interest ( cf . Figure 1 ) [ 77 ] . Depending on the model detail , a simulation can yield a much greater spatial and tempo - ral resolution than any microscopic imaging approach . The analysis of the results with an equally powerful visualisation method accordingly leads to valuable insights into the cell [ 276 ] . Comparing the visualization of the simulation with life cell images enables adjusting transport and structural parameters of the model and ﬁnally closes the loop in an iteratively improving holistic data - driven modeling strategy . 3 . 6 Conclusions for the Present Work Only particle based models which track the molecules on continuous space through the cell allow modeling and analyzing the diffusion through the crowded intracellular environ - ment [ 167 , 168 , 175 , 220 , 305 ] , as well as the molecular crowding effects on reaction rates [ 196 , 254 , 287 , 329 ] . The fact , that each molecule is treated individually leads to an increased computational effort . As long as only the molecules of interest are included in the model , the simulation still is feasible [ 8 ] ( signal transduction simulations beneﬁt from the fact , that sig - naling molecules are mostly of low abundance ) . The current simulation methods do however not support the modeling of a detailed and realis - tic model cytoskeleton , as well as the transport of motor proteins along these tracks . Therefore a new simulation was developed based on Lapin et al . [ 168 ] . In order to improve the perfor - mance of the simulation also an improved formula for the reaction framework was developed based on the model of Pogson et al . [ 239 ] . Section 4 . 3 . 1 explains how the reaction event is implemented in the present simulation , including a comparison with the other modeling methods . In addition , the reaction framework is extended to interactions with the cytoskele - ton or membranes , and the directed transport by motorproteins is added . The aim of the present work was also to provide a simulation which can be coupled with the visualization framework of Falk et al . [ 77 ] and included the possibility to port the simulation to the highly parallel processor architectures of the current generation of graphic cards [ 77 ] . 24 Chapter 4 Simulation Method The following sections describe the setup and functionality of the simulation method . In order to highlight and reason the necessary modeling assumptions or simpliﬁcations , the advantages of the chosen method as well as the limitations and challenges will be discussed along with the description . 4 . 1 Setup of the Simulation The simulation is set up in a continuous space discrete time framework . The mobile molecules ( ’agents’ ) in the simulation can therefore move in an off - lattice manner . The cellular struc - tures and molecular ( inter - ) actions are described in the following sections . Figure 4 . 1 shows the general setup of the simulation ﬂow . Figure 4 . 1 : Basic simulation framework . First , the simula - tion is initiated , then the time is repeatedly increased by ∆ t . Within this timestep the mobile agents move and interact . 25 4 . SIMULATION METHOD 4 . 1 . 1 Static Structures : Nucleus , Cytoskeleton , Crowder Molecules The compartmentalization and structure of the cell is reﬂected by different intracellular com - partments and a cytoskeleton network . The static structures are deﬁned at the startup of the simulation . Mobile agents are not allowed to move through these structures . Therefore the cytoskeleton leads to a reduced free volume fraction , which can be further reduced by addi - tional crowder molecules . For simplicity , the shape of the virtual cellular structures is limited to spheres and elongated cylinders . Figure 3 . 4 shows that it is possible to model the cell based on these structures realistically . In principle an extension to other geometric structures is pos - sible . The cellular structures can be treated as immobile agents , and the kind of the structure deﬁnes the type / properties of these ﬁxed agents in the simulation . Plasma Membrane The ﬁrst object of this static kind is the plasma membrane , which is deﬁned as a sphere with the radius of the cell . The plasma membrane deﬁnes the limit of the ( virtual ) cell . Therefore , in contrast to all other structures , the interior of the plasma membrane sphere is the valid space for mobile ( intracellular ) agents – they are not allowed to move beyond it . Nucleus The nucleus is modeled as a sphere inside the cell . It is the second type of an immobile agent . The size is determined in the parameter input ﬁle of the simulation ( as a fraction of the cell radius ) . The surface of the nucleus is a further boundary of the cytoplasm . Mobile intracellular agents cannot cross this border . Only the nucleo - cytoplasmic shuttling reaction as deﬁned in Sec - tion 4 . 4 . 1 can transport molecules into the nucleus . The intra - nuclear space is not explicitly modeled in the whole - cell simulation . Figure 4 . 2 : ( a ) For a homogeneous cytoskeleton distribution , also ﬁlaments that are centered out - side of the test volume ( indicated by a red center ) have to be included . Otherwise the volume at the surface would be less crowded ( b ) . ( c ) Shows only the test volume without overlapping parts . ( d ) With - out elements that are centered inside but extend over the border ( indicated by a yellow center ) , the inhomogeneity would be further increased . 26 4 . 1 . Setup of the Simulation Crowding Agents The third kind of immobile agents in the simulation represents crowding molecules . These molecules are modeled by spheres , which like the nucleus must not be penetrated by mobile agents . The spheres can be arranged randomly or – for comparison of the impact on the mobility of tracer molecules – in a regular lattice . ( cf . Figure 3 . 2 ) . The number and size of the crowding spheres sums up to a speciﬁc excluded volume fraction . It is , in principle , possible to adjust the size of the crowding spheres to that of e . g . ribosomes or even smaller proteins , but then a tremendous number of crowding agents is needed in order to reach a realistic volume fraction of crowding molecules in the cell . Cytoskeleton Filaments Cytoskeleton ﬁlaments are modeled as cylinders , whose size can be adjusted to e . g . actin ﬁlaments , intermediate ﬁlaments or microtubules [ 3 ] . Larger cylinders can represent bundles of multiple ﬁlaments or structures of the complex microtrabecular lattice [ 152 , 222 ] . All ﬁlaments have the same length in the present simulation . Except if stated otherwise , all cylinders also have the same radius for simplicity 1 . The default cytoskeleton architecture in the simulation is created by cylinders with a uniform random distribution of their position and orientation ( cf . Figure 3 . 4 , which compares an in vivo [ 200 ] and in silico section of the cytoskeleton and further crowding molecules ) . Again , the crowding structures can overlap . It is worth noting , that it is ( nearly ) impossible to create a random setup with non - overlapping elongated cylinders and a reasonable cylinder density . The cylinders can also be located partly outside of the cell . These cropped cylinders must be kept in the simulation if the cylinder density is supposed to be equal ( on average ) in every part of the cell ( see Figure 4 . 2 ) . Furthermore extra cylinders are needed , that have their center outside of the cell but partly reach into it . Other possible orientations of the cytoskeleton are a radial or linear alignment of the cytoskeleton . In this case , the position of the center of the cylinder is still random , but the direction is aligned with the polarization pattern ( cf . Figure 8 . 9 ) . Data like [ 200 ] could eventually be used to reproduce the in vivo cytoskeleton even more realistically in the simulation . 4 . 1 . 2 Calculation of the Excluded Volume Fraction As soon as the objects which form the excluded volume start to overlap , the calculation of this volume becomes nontrivial , especially in the case of irregular / random architectures . In order to measure the occupied volume fraction of cytoskeleton structures and crowding objects 1 From the performance perspective , it is better to declare different types of cylinder objects than assigning an individual radius if different kinds of ﬁlaments are supposed to be modeled . Otherwise the extra array with the individual radius would contain only a few different numbers but occupy signiﬁcant memory space . 27 4 . SIMULATION METHOD in the cell , two methods have been developed for the simulation and are described in the following . Monte Carlo Measuring Method The free volume fraction φ is sampled with the following Monte Carlo method : • test spheres are placed randomly in the cell • the fraction of spheres at valid positions that do not overlap with any crowding structure equals the free volume fraction φ ( for the respective test sphere radius , which can also be 0 ) . • Since space can only be either free or occupied ( i . e . excluded ) , φ and the excluded volume fraction (cid:15) sum up to 1 . The excluded volume fraction is (cid:15) = 1 − φ accordingly . Analytical Formula In the completely random and randomly overlapping setup of crowding objects , the average excluded volume fraction can be calculated with the following recursive approach : • The excluded volume of one unit of the cytoskeleton ( crowder object ) is deﬁned as u 1 . • The excluded volume of i units which are randomly arranged and can overlap is V i . • Naturally , V 0 = 0 and V 1 = u 1 . • The next unit will ( on average ) overlap with the previous unit ( s ) with a probability that is just given by the excluded volume fraction of the previous unit ( s ) V i − 1 / V total . Ac - cordingly , this fraction has to be subtracted from the additional volume of the additional unit : V i = V i − 1 + u 1 (cid:18) 1 − V i − 1 V total (cid:19) = V i − 1 (cid:18) 1 − u 1 V total (cid:19) + u 1 ( 4 . 1 ) • With the deﬁnition (cid:15) 1 : = u 1 / V total ( the excluded volume fraction of one unit ) the de - velopment of the volume becomes : V 0 = 0 , V 1 = u 1 V 2 = V 1 ( 1 − (cid:15) 1 ) + u 1 = u 1 (cid:8) ( 1 − (cid:15) 1 ) 1 + 1 (cid:9) V 3 = V 2 ( 1 − (cid:15) 1 ) + u 1 = u 1 (cid:8) ( 1 − (cid:15) 1 ) 2 + ( 1 − (cid:15) 1 ) 1 + 1 (cid:9) . . . V i = i − 1 (cid:88) n = 0 ( 1 − (cid:15) 1 ) n u 1 ( 4 . 2 ) • This equation for V i can be proved with a complete induction . It contains the geometric series and simpliﬁes to V i = u 1 1 − ( 1 − (cid:15) 1 ) i (cid:15) 1 ( 4 . 3 ) 28 4 . 1 . Setup of the Simulation • With the original deﬁnitions of u 1 and (cid:15) 1 the fraction u 1 / (cid:15) 1 = V total , and Equation 4 . 3 becomes V i = V total × (cid:16) 1 − ( 1 − (cid:15) 1 ) i (cid:17) ( 4 . 4 ) • The requested excluded volume fraction of i structures is just (cid:15) : = V i / V total , so by dividing Equation ( 4 . 4 ) by V total the ﬁnal result is found : (cid:15) = 1 − ( 1 − (cid:15) 1 ) i ; φ = ( 1 − (cid:15) 1 ) i = φ i 1 ( 4 . 5 ) • If different kinds of obstacles are used in the model , for each class the excluded volume fraction (cid:15) class can be calculated using Equation ( 4 . 5 ) and then the total excluded volume of all obstacles taken together can be estimated by the initial Equation ( 4 . 1 ) , where the volume of the class of obstacles (cid:15) class × V total is used instead of individual volumes u 1 . Note that Equation ( 4 . 1 ) is not restricted to equal units but will also work if each unit has a different volume . Average Length of the Cytoskeleton Filaments As mentioned in Section 4 . 1 . 1 the randomly arranged cytoskeleton ﬁlaments partly extend themselves outside of the cell ( cf . Figure 4 . 2 , ) ¸ . Depending on the interactions in the signal - transduction model it can be important to know the total / average length of the cytoskeleton ﬁlaments . This length can be calculated in two ways : 1 . by directly calculating the length of each cylinder based on the intersections with the plasma membrane , which involves a complicated calculation for each object . 2 . by deviding the effective cytoskeleton volume by the area of the cylinders πr 2 filament the effective length of the cylinders can be calculated . • the effective cytoskeleton volume (cid:15) MC is accessed by the Monte Carlo ( MC ) mea - surement as described above . • the average length of one ﬁlament l eff 1 is then obtained by resolving Equation ( 4 . 5 ) for (cid:15) 1 , MC and devided by πr 2 filament : l eff 1 = (cid:15) 1 , MC V total πr 2 filament = (cid:110) 1 − ( 1 − (cid:15) MC ) ( 1 / i ) (cid:111) V total πr 2 filament ( 4 . 6 ) 4 . 1 . 3 Advantages and Shortcomings of the Static Structures The main advantage of the static cytoskeleton and crowding objects is the simple and thus fast computational handling . Only a few , static parameters are needed to describe the structures ( see the list in Appendix B . 1 . 2 ) . The treatment of mobile obstacles would lead to much more 29 4 . SIMULATION METHOD interactions that have to be calculated in every timestep . Section 4 . 2 . 3 describes the arising complexity if everything in the cell starts moving . Eventually also the dynamics of the cy - toskeleton growth for instance have to be modeled correctly if included , but the respective rules are not yet completely discovered in detail [ 42 , 62 ] . In contrast , the static cytoskeleton structures could be obtained with great detail from cryoelectron tomography images [ 200 ] . The persistence length of microtubules is 5200 µ m , for actin ﬁlaments it is 17 . 7 µ m [ 100 ] . This gives an estimate of the ﬂexibility of the cytoskeleton . Based on these values , the cy - toskeleton can be treated as static for short timescales and small tracer molecules that are not strong enough to stretch the network - structure and squeeze through meshes , which orig - inally were too small . Changes in the structure depend on both the timescales of the actual cytoskeleton dynamics and the strength of the forces acting on the ﬁlaments [ 17 , 65 , 76 , 315 ] . 4 . 2 Mobile Agents The simulation contains only molecules of species that are part of the model . These molecules are included as mobile agents in the simulation and are represented by spheres with the radius of the original molecule . During each iteration of the simulation the agents move to a new position . Reactions between the agents can be triggered depending on the distances to other agents in the simulation . All other molecules or objects in the cell ( e . g . kinases , enzymes , etc . of other pathways / cell functions as well as ribosomes or organelles ) are implicitly included in the static crowding structures described in the previous section . Considering the different classes of proteins and molecules in the cell , different types of particle distributions and movements have to be deﬁned : 1 . Plasma Membrane Proteins : molecules like the receptors in the plasma membrane are integrated in the plasma membrane structure . The initial setup along the cell surface is a uniform random distribution . The motion is restricted to a two - dimensional diffusion within the surface . 2 . Nuclear Proteins : molecules like the nuclear pore complex are located outside in the membrane of the nucleus . Again , these molecules can diffuse in two dimensions along the surface ( but of course , the diffusion coefﬁcient can be set to zero if the nuclear pore has a ﬁxed position ) . Since the particle based simulation ends at the border of the nucleus , also nuclear proteins can be assigned to this state . 3 . Cytosolic Proteins are distributed in the cytosol , where they can diffuse around . The mobility is restricted by the plasma membrane , the nucleus , and all crowding and cy - toskeleton structures . Reaction - diffusion processes or speciﬁc interactions with a polar - ized cellular architecture can subsequently lead to a gradient in the protein distribution . 30 4 . 2 . Mobile Agents 4 . 2 . 1 Initial Positions During the setup of the simulation , all molecules are placed on an initial position . The molecules of one species can be placed either on the plasma membrane , the nucleus or as cytosolic molecules as described above . The initial distribution of the molecules is uniform and random within the limitations of the compartment they are assigned to . In addition , par - ticles can only be placed on a position that is not restricted by a static structure . Starting from this valid position the molecule can then move in every timestep of the simulation . 4 . 2 . 2 Motion The agent positions are updated in every timestep due to their motion (cid:126)x ( t + ∆ t ) = (cid:126)x + ∆ (cid:126)x ( 4 . 7 ) ∆ (cid:126)x depends on the means of transport and also on the time step ∆ t . This dependency relates the spatial and temporal resolution of the simulation . The present simulation does not include explicit inter - molecular forces . Therefore the new position always has to be checked against the obstacles like the cytoskeleton or crowding agents . Steps that would end in a prohibited volume are not allowed . The exact treatment of these events is described in Section 4 . 2 . 3 . Diffusion Brownian motion and the corresponding diffusion is a stochastic Wiener process , which can be described by the Langevin equation . In this simulation framework , diffusion can therefore simply be modeled as a random walk . In order to model a speciﬁc diffusion coefﬁcient D 0 , based on Equation ( 2 . 1 ) ∆ (cid:126)x in Equation ( 4 . 7 ) becomes [ 88 , 305 ] : ∆ (cid:126)x = (cid:112) ( 2 D 0 ∆ t ) × (cid:126)ξ ( 4 . 8 ) The stochastic force behind Brownian motion is translated into the Gaussian random number (cid:126)ξ with mean 0 and (cid:104) ξ i , ξ j (cid:105) = δ ij [ 88 ] . The central limit theorem allows using other distributions of random numbers – the repeated application of the random step leads to a fast convolution into a normal distribution ( see Appendix A . 1 ) . Simpler distributions thus can be used , but with a critical consideration of the advantage ( computationally simpler and thus faster ) versus the disadvantages ( reduced accuracy at short times ) . In case of two - dimensional diffusion in the plasma membrane or the surface of the nucleus the same approach is used , but the position is projected back into the surface after the step 2 . 2 In principle , it is also possible to add force ﬁelds or inter - particle forces . For example , the velocity ﬁeld of a medium can be obtained from computational ﬂuid dynamic simulations , and for every diffusing particle one 31 4 . SIMULATION METHOD Rotational Diffusion The rotational diffusion of molecules is not included in the simulation , because all molecules are represented by unstructured spheres . Due to the symmetry the orientation does not matter for the interactions with other molecules or collisions with obstacles . The rotational diffusion is ( in general ) much faster than the translational diffusion [ 227 ] , therefore it can be assumed that the spherical molecule in the model represent the average of the different orientations of the originally asymmetric molecules at the chosen temporal resolution of the simulation . However , if the ( atomic ) molecular structure of the proteins is included in the model , the rotational motion of the molecules should be calculated along with the translational step . Motor Protein Transport Nature provides a rich toolbox of motor proteins that can carry cargo in a speciﬁc direction along the cytoskeleton [ 310 ] . In this case the movement is parallel to the skeleton ﬁber , to which the motor is attached to . If the normalized direction of the skeleton ﬁlament is (cid:126)s , ∆ (cid:126)x from Equation ( 4 . 7 ) becomes | ∆ (cid:126)x | = v motor ∆ t × (cid:126)s ( 4 . 9 ) The length of the step depends on the velocity of the motor protein v motor . Depending on the directional preference of the motor on the polarized cytoskeleton ﬁber , the sign of v motor is plus or minus 3 . Active Transport Across a Membrane , Import and Export Processes These transport processes are modeled as a reaction , in which the agents properties are changed from an external to an internal molecule or vice versa . The reaction framework is described in Section 4 . 4 . 1 . If the nuclear pore complex is modeled in detail , the reaction between the nuclear pore agent and the cytosolic molecule leads to a nuclear molecule . This reaction is simply a bimolecular reaction as described in Section 4 . 3 . 1 . can add the local velocity in ∆ (cid:126)x from Equation ( 4 . 7 ) as ∆ (cid:126)x = ∆ (cid:126)x ( D 0 , ∆ t ) + (cid:126)v field × ∆ t [ 88 , 166 ] . 3 Naturally the movement of the motor protein is stochastic but biased in its preferred direction . More in detail , it is a step with a length that depends on the particular motor protein , and the step occurs with a speciﬁc distribution [ 257 ] . This could be implemented as well in the framework of a ﬁrst order reaction not changing but moving the molecule , but on the cost that a second parameter ( or even more parameters , cf . [ 255 ] ) like the prob - ability P stepping to do a step within ( t , t + ∆ t ] is needed to describe the detailed motion . The average outcome (cid:104) P stepping [ 1 / s ] × L step [ µ m ] (cid:105) = v motor [ µ m / s ] will then equal the approach used in the presented framework . The uncertainty of the microscopic parameters together with the more complex and thus less efﬁcient simulation performance eventually led to the decision to use the average velocity ( cf . Table A . 4 in Appendix A . 4 ) . More parameters can be found e . g . in [ 309 , 310 ] , more on the theoretical description in [ 159 , 249 ] . 32 4 . 2 . Mobile Agents 4 . 2 . 3 Obstacles , Collisions , and the Effective Diffusion The obstacles in the cell reduce the diffusion of the mobile components . The current effective diffusion coefﬁcient can be calculated based on the average displacement within the interval [ t 0 , t ] in the systematic of Equation ( 2 . 1 ) , where d is the dimension : D eff = (cid:10) ( (cid:126)x ( t ) − (cid:126)x ( t 0 ) ) 2 (cid:11) 2 d × ( t − t 0 ) ( 4 . 10 ) This effective diffusion can be set into relation with the original diffusion coefﬁcient D 0 which would be measured if no obstacles are present . D eff D 0 = (cid:10) ( (cid:126)x ( t ) − (cid:126)x ( t 0 ) ) 2 (cid:11) 2 dD 0 × ( t − t 0 ) ( 4 . 11 ) The fraction D eff / D 0 returns the effective slowdown of the mobility by the crowding and hindering structures in the tested volume . Especially it is a measure for the tortuous way of tracer particles around obstacles or into dead ends in the free volume structure . Depending on the simulation framework the calculated D eff / D 0 also includes the effects that the algorithm has on the motion of the particles , e . g . a reduced average step length . Since only the relative slowdown is measured , the number D eff / D 0 is independent of D 0 . If D 0 is increased , the displacement within [ t 0 , t ] will be increased ( see Equation ( 4 . 8 ) ) as well . Likewise D eff is increased . The hindrance by the structure still has the same inﬂuence ( tortuosity ) , and therefore leads the same relative reduction of the motion . During this work , two different testing environments have been developed : 1 . Periodic Boundary Conditions : A ﬁnite test volume with length L will eventually limit (cid:10) ( (cid:126)x ( t ) − (cid:126)x ( t 0 ) ) 2 (cid:11) and can accordingly lead to a wrong estimate of D eff / D 0 . Therefore , the test volume is generated with periodic boundary conditions , i . e . re - peated unlimited times in all directions ( see Figure 4 . 3 ) . The current tracer position can be mapped to the test volume with the ( computationally ) simple modulo function x L = | 2 × | x | mod L − | x | mod ( 2 L ) | Simulations should run until the fastest particles have traveled several times through the test volume , in order to make sure that the volume properties are correctly sampled . 2 . Testing in the Virtual Cell : The inﬂuence of the cytoskeleton on the diffusion can also be measured directly in the virtual cell which is used in the simulation of signaling processes for instance . In the diffusion - testing mode , the nucleus is removed , and the test molecules are placed in the center of the cell . The measurement of the effective 33 4 . SIMULATION METHOD Figure 4 . 3 : ( a ) Periodic boundary conditions in effective diffusion tests . Note that the long cylinders lead to inconsistencies at the boundaries at this irregular structure . ( b ) In order to avoid problems with cylinders that overlap the border , the volume is mirrored at the boundary , which leads to a more consistent obstacle structure . The sample path shows how a test molecule moves through this region . diffusion can then only run until the ﬁrst tracer has reached the plasma membrane , which limits a further displacement . Handling of Collisions in the Simulation All motion steps can only be executed if the step does not end ( go through ) the excluded volume . The simulation does not include any repulsive forces which would lead agents around the obstacles . Therefore the proposed path of the agent within the timestep has to be tested against all obstacles 4 . In principle , the following three methods can be distinguished [ 152 ] : 1 . Reﬂection : The path is reﬂected upon a collision at the surface of the obstacle and continues the remaining path of the step into the new direction . The average length of the refracted paths is shorter than that of the straight paths . This leads to a reduced mo - bility . This method is not applicable to agents that move along a cytoskeleton ﬁlament by the motor protein motion , since they could be diffracted away from the ﬁlament . 2 . Retry : Instead of verifying the whole path , only the endpoints are veriﬁed in this ap - proach . If the proposed ﬁnal position is restricted by an obstacle , the full step is rejected and a new step is tried instead until a step with a valid endpoint is found . Especially in densely crowded situations this approach would preferably select small steps ( longer steps would more likely end in an obstacle in this case ) . Thus the average step length is reduced . Again , this method will not work in the case of agents that move along the cytoskeleton because the deterministic motion would retry the very same step again and again . 3 . Stopping : ( Complete rejection of the step ) : It is much simpler to reset the agent to 4 Appendix B shows , how the performance can be improved by just considering the neighboring obstacles 34 4 . 2 . Mobile Agents the previous ( and valid ) position and to wait for the next step than to retry it within the same timestep . All steps that would have ended in an obstacle contribute therefore no displacement to the overall motion of particles , which again leads to a reduced mobility . Motor protein transported agents would again be trapped , for the same reasons as in the previous case . The evident problem concerning the motor protein transport is treated in the following way : if a collision occurs , the transport mode will be changed to diffusion . The agent then has a chance to diffuse around the obstacle and bind to the same or another cytoskeleton ﬁlament for further motorized transport . The advantages and disadvantages of the collision - testing methods is discussed and ex - plained in Appendix A . 2 . Eventually , method ( 2 ) was used to obtain the effective diffusion coefﬁcients shown in Section 5 . 2 . 1 and published in [ 152 ] . Method ( 3 ) is implemented in the present simulation for signal transduction and vesicle transport because it is faster and more robust in the reaction - diffusion framework . It is also the best one considering a future parallelization of the motion step in the simulation . The same calculations have to be done for every agent , and the calculation does not need to be repeated in case of a rejection of the step . 4 . 2 . 4 Molecular Crowding vs . Overlapping Agents Overlapping Agents – the ’Standard Version’ of the Simulation In the standard version of the present simulation , the mobile agents move independent of each other , which means that they can overlap . As long as the concentrations of the molecules which are modeled in the simulation are low , the probability that two agents actually will overlap is low as well . Therefore the error on the mobility of the agents introduced by the missing agent collisions is negligible . Reactions are not affected by this simulation approach – moreover the chosen framework for reactions requires that the agents overlap . Again , the aim of the simulation is especially to model signal transduction processes that rely on low abundance signaling molecules . Thus it is justiﬁed to use this simpliﬁcation in order to yield a performant simulation . This approach is furthermore helpful considering a possible parallelization of the simulation on a supercomputer . Since the agents move independent of each other , the motion step can be done in parallel . In addition , this approach allows sampling the effective diffusion with many particles in one run in order to reduce stochastic ﬂuctuations , because all particles move independent of each other . 35 4 . SIMULATION METHOD Interacting Agents and Molecular Crowding In contrast , modeling of molecular crowding effects by mobile crowding agents requires a dif - ferent simulation framework compared to ﬁxed obstacles . Obviously , the mobile test agents which represent the molecules of interest in the model have to avoid the mobile crowding agents as in the static case . But in addition , also the mobile crowding agents have to avoid the test agents in their motion step – otherwise they might end up overlapping . This means that there is no difference between mobile test agents and mobile crowding agents – all agents have to follow the same rules . The collision of mobile agents can be treated again in different ways : ( 1 ) ballistic reﬂection [ 46 ] , ( 2 ) rejection of the step and retry until a valid step is found , ( 3 ) rejection of the step [ 54 , 254 ] , and ( 4 ) based on a repulsive potential which prevents collisions on the cost of a more complex algorithm [ 287 , 324 ] . Within the extremely crowded conditions of the cytosol , an extremely short timestep has to be chosen in order to avoid an excessive rejection of steps [ 264 ] or multiple and complex collisions . The small timestep and the extreme number of interactions will also lead to an exorbitant computation time if a complete cell is simulated with realistic molecule numbers . Nevertheless , the present computational framework is also able to test the diffusion coefﬁcient of interacting spheres with satisfying results . Model and Results are shown in Appendix D . 1 . By this approach the molecular crowding effect within the cell could be analyzed . It is worth noting , that the effective diffusion coefﬁcient does not only depend on the excluded volume fraction but also on the size of the mobile obstacles . Many small molecules have a different effect than a few large molecules with the same volume fraction than the small molecules . In order to model the inﬂuence of the crowding molecules correctly , the number and the size distribution of the crowding agents therefore has to match the in vivo numbers [ 324 ] . 36 4 . 3 . Reactions 4 . 3 Reactions In a reaction one or more reactants is / are converted into one or more products . The number of reactants and products does not have to be equal because two molecules can together form one new molecule ( e . g . a receptor - ligand complex ) and this complex can again dissociate into two molecules . In the simulation , a reaction changes the type of the agent , but leaves the position unchanged . If necessary , agents are created or destroyed . 4 . 3 . 1 Reactions between Molecules A reaction between two molecules can occur , if the following conditions are fulﬁlled [ 208 ] : • the reactants are close enough together . • the reactants are oriented in the right direction towards each other , so that the reactive sites can interact ( the orientation is governed e . g . by the rotational diffusion ) . • the reaction between the two reactants is energetically possible ( e . g . because the kinetic energy of the collision is high enough to overcome the reaction barrier ) . The reaction probability between two molecules is therefore given by the probability of the collision and the probability that a reaction occurs during the collision ( which depends on factors like the orientation and energy ) [ 198 ] 5 . The claim of the simulation is , that it can reproduce the macroscopic ( mass action kinet - ics ) rate constant k ij for a bimolecular reaction as shown above in homogeneous conditions . This means , that the convolution of the collision and reaction probability has to yield the given macroscopic reaction rate . The discrete time simulation framework complicates the estimation of the reaction probability . The position of the molecules is only known at t n and t n + 1 = t n + ∆ t . All the collisions that happen within the interval [ t , t + ∆ t ) are not directly accessible . Furthermore , the number of tractable collisions depends on ∆ t . A smaller ∆ t leads to a ﬁner sampling of the original time interval and reveals more collisions . The reac - tion probability per collision therefore has to be adjusted with ∆ t . 5 In the aqueous solution of the cytosol , the motion of the molecules is governed by diffusion . Furthermore , most biochemical reactions are much more complex than inorganic chemical reactions . Therefore , and with respect to the neglected rotational diffusion in the simulation as well as the assumption of spherically symmetric molecules without a speciﬁc reaction site , all requirements like orientation , energy , etc . can be lumped together into one reaction probability , given that a collision between the molecules has occurred . 37 4 . SIMULATION METHOD Derivation of the Simulation Method 6 As shown by Pogson et al . [ 239 ] , the calculation of the bimolecular reaction properties in an event - based stochastic framework can be derived from the macroscopic ( ordinary differ - ential equation ) description dc i / dt = dc j / dt = − k ij c i c j . For simplicity , the units of the concentrations should be [ molecules / µ m 3 ] 7 . The balance equation can be discretized ∆ c i ∆ t = ∆ c j ∆ t = − k ij c i c j ( 4 . 12 ) and converted according to c i × V cell = N i in order to track molecule numbers : ∆ N i ∆ t = ∆ N j ∆ t = − k ij N i N j × 1 V cell ( 4 . 13 ) ∆ N describes the change in the number of molecules and thus the number of reactions within ∆ t . Within the timestep ∆ t the fraction | ∆ N i | N i = ∆ t × k ij × N j V cell and | ∆ N j | N j = ∆ t × k ij × N i V cell ( 4 . 14 ) of the i and j molecules respectively will react . According to mass action kinetics , the number of reactions is proportional to the number of reaction partners and the rate constant k ij . The corresponding ’reaction’ volume ∆ V = ( k ij ∆ t ) ( 4 . 15 ) can be introduced [ 239 ] , which indeed has the units of volume : the units of k ij are in the given framework [ volume / molecules × 1 / s ] , and the unit of ∆ t is [ s ] . So ( k ij ∆ t ) gives just [ volume / molecules ] which can be further speciﬁed to [ reaction volume / molecule ] . Replacing ∆ t × k ij in Equation ( 4 . 14 ) by ∆ V leads to | ∆ N i | N i = ∆ V V cell × N j and | ∆ N j | N j = ∆ V V cell × N i ( 4 . 16 ) In the completely homogeneous framework the fraction of reacting molecules corresponds to a fraction of the volume in which all molecules react , while they do not react in the remaining volume . From the perspective of the i molecules , the reaction volume is located at the j molecules 6 Parts of this section are publication as : M . T . Klann , A . Lapin , and M . Reuss . Stochastic Simulation of Reactions in the Crowded and Structured Intracellular Environment : Inﬂuence of Mobility and Location of the Reactants . BMC Systems Biology 5 ( 1 ) : 71 , 2011 . 7 The units of k ij are then [ µ m 3 / molecules / s ] . If c i is given in [ mol / liter ] , the factor N A / 10 15 [ liter / ( µ m 3 mol ) ] , where N A is the Avogadro number , is required for the respective conversion . 38 4 . 3 . Reactions with which they react . Accordingly , it can be wrapped around the molecules . For symmetry reasons the reaction volume should be spherical . The corresponding ’reaction’ radius of the spherical reaction volume is then r reactionij = 3 (cid:114) 3 4 π ∆ V = 3 (cid:114) 3 4 π k ij ∆ t ( 4 . 17 ) This reaction radius is used by Pogson et al . [ 239 ] . Since the reaction volume is wrapped around the j molecules from the perspective of the i molecules , it is multiplied with N j as re - quired by Equation ( 4 . 16 ) leading to the right number of reactions in the homogeneous case . From the perspective of j molecules it is accordingly multiplied by N i . A molecule of species i will react with one molecule of species j , if both are closer than the critical reaction distance r reactionij ( and vice versa j will react with i ) . This distance grows ∝ ∆ t 1 / 3 according to Equation ( 4 . 17 ) , compensating the ∆ t - dependency in the sampled col - lision frequency in the given framework , which was discussed above . Note , that the particles have to overlap in order to react . As explained and reasoned in Sec - tion 4 . 2 . 3 , this is allowed in the present simulation framework for the moving agents . Since the reaction volume is now bound to the molecules and not arbitrarily distributed in the cell , the approach is not limited to uniform particle distributions . Linking Macroscopic Theory and the Single Event of one Reaction : Impact of Diffusion Initially , a uniform random distribution of molecules is assumed . On average , exactly ∆ N i molecules are closer to j molecules than the reaction distance and will therefore react . Sub - sequently , the reaction rate depends on the ﬂux of the remaining i molecules towards the remaining j molecules . The number of molecules entering the reaction volume is hence de - termined by the combined diffusion coefﬁcient D i + D j and the size of the surface of the reaction volume . A comparison with the theory of diffusion limited reactions leads to the following conclusions [ 20 ] : • Diffusion Limit : The maximal reaction rate constant for a bimolecular reaction of two spherical molecules i and j with radius r i and r j is : k D = 4 π ( r i + r j ) ( D i + D j ) ( in 3D ) [ 280 ] . It equals the collision rate of the molecules 8 . • Microscopic Reaction Rate Constant : If not every encounter between two reactants leads to a reaction , the microscopic reaction rate constant k micro determines the fraction of collisions which lead to subsequent reactions . 9 . Obviously , the given microscopic simulation framework requires to use k micro . 8 The fact , that initially some nearby pairs will react faster leads to an initially time dependent reaction rate constant k D ( t ) = 4 π ( r i + r j ) ( D i + D j ) × ( 1 + ( r i + r j ) / (cid:112) π ( D i + D j ) t ) [ 252 , 300 ] . 9 Note : this microscopic reaction rate corresponds to the surface reaction rate used at the partially reactive , partially reﬂective boundary condition in the Fokker - Planck equation [ 167 , 168 ] . 39 4 . SIMULATION METHOD • Effective Macroscopic / Bulk Reaction Rate Constant : The resulting reaction rate constant which is observed on the macroscopic level , corresponding to the rate constant k ij , is in the context of a diffusion controlled reaction determined as [ 20 ] : 1 k ij = 1 k D + 1 k micro ( 4 . 18 ) • Reaction Radius : The reaction radius between two molecules is in this context given naturally as ( r i + r j ) . Only if using this radius the corresponding ﬂux across the reaction surface 4 π ( r reactionij + Diff ) 2 will lead to the expected macroscopic k ij value based on a given k micro . Accordingly , r reactionij + Diff = ( r i + r j ) ( 4 . 19 ) has to be used in the simulation as critical reaction radius . • Conﬂict with the Volume - Based Setup : This reaction radius is in a critical conﬂict with the reaction radius which was determined in Equation ( 4 . 17 ) – the radii are not equal . In the given framework , r reactionij (cid:28) r reactionij + Diff due to the necessary small ∆ t . This means that the surface of the reaction volume deﬁned by r reactionij is too small leading to a falsely reduced macroscopic reaction rate . In contrast , the larger r reactionij + Diff would lead to a falsely increased macroscopic reaction rate in the volume based description developed above . • Solution : Reaction Probability in the Interaction Volume : Both concepts , the ﬂux - ( surface ) - based description and the macroscopic , volume - based framework can be brought into agreement in the following way : 1 . The true collision radius r reactionij + Diff = ( r i + r j ) is used in the simulation as critical reaction radius . 2 . Since only macroscopic reaction rate constants are given in the literature , k ij is used as input parameter . The corresponding micro rate constant is then ( based on Equation 4 . 18 ) k micro = k D × k ij k D − k ij ( 4 . 20 ) and the corresponding reaction volume should be in analogy to Equation ( 4 . 15 ) ∆ V + Diff = ( k micro ∆ t ) ( 4 . 21 ) 3 . The mismatching reaction volume is adjusted by introducing the reaction proba - bility P reactionij + Diff = k micro ∆ t 4 π / 3 ( r i + r j ) 3 ( 4 . 22 ) 40 4 . 3 . Reactions Figure 4 . 4 : Bimolecular reaction between the molecules i and j . r i and r j denote the respec - tive radius of the molecules . ξ is a uniform ran - dom number of the interval [ 0 , 1 ] . which effectively reduces the reaction volume determined by the collision radius to the reaction volume given by Equation ( 4 . 21 ) while it retains the correct inter - action surface 10 . • Resulting Reaction Algorithm : Two particles i and j will react if the distance between them is smaller than r reactionij + Diff and a random number of the interval [ 0 , 1 ] is smaller than P reactionij + Diff ( which on average leads to a reaction with the probability P reactionij + Diff ) . The schematics of this algorithm is also shown in Figure 4 . 4 . Reactions in 2D The signiﬁcantly different properties of diffusion in 2D lead to a bimolecular reaction with a time / concentration dependent k D which does not allow to use Equation 4 . 18 [ 20 , 115 , 300 ] . Therefore , the input reaction rate in the simulation is directly the microscopic reaction rate constant k 2 Dmicro . The corresponding reaction probability based on the collision - area π ( r i + r j ) 2 is accordingly P reaction , 2 D ij + Diff = k 2 Dmicro ∆ t π ( r i + r j ) 2 ( 4 . 23 ) This allows modeling the interaction of membrane bound molecules as well as the further analysis of diffusion limited reactions in two dimensions . 4 . 3 . 2 Comparison with Other Methods , Remarks , and Test Results The presented approach was successfully tested in 3D and returned the desired macroscopic reaction rate with sufﬁcient accuracy in homogeneous conditions . In order to evaluate the 10 This approach also reﬂects the nature of reactions in a probabilistic framework : the overall , macroscopic reaction probability is now determined given by the probability to collide and the probability to react , given that a collision has occurred . 41 4 . SIMULATION METHOD capability of this reaction framework , it will be compared to other methods in the following . Furthermore , test results are discussed in this section . Comparison with the Fokker - Planck Approach The Fokker - Planck approach as presented in Section 3 . 3 . 3 was developed starting from the microscopic interaction between two reactants at the reactive surface [ 167 , 168 ] . In contrast , the present method was developed starting from the macroscopic reaction rate . By wrapping the interaction volume around the reaction partner and introducing the microscopic reaction rate based on the collision rate constant , the present method is likewise based on the micro - scopic interaction between a pair of molecules . The main differences between the methods are : • Determination of the number of reactions within ( ( t , t + ∆ t ] : The number of reac - tions is determined by the boundary condition ( D i + D j ) ∂W / ∂t = k (cid:48) W ( r i + r j ) in the Fokker - Planck approach . The resulting ﬂux of the probability density function W ( r , t ) across the reactive surface explicitly includes the diffusion coefﬁcient . In contrast , the present method is based on the number of molecules which are in a reasonably sized and distributed reaction volume . Obviously , this reaction volume has to be ( re - ) ﬁlled before each reaction step . The diffusion coefﬁcient determines , how quickly molecules will move into the respective reaction volume , thus the diffusion coefﬁcient is implic - itly included in the framework . Appendix A . 5 . 2 shows that both concepts lead to equal results based on the numerical solution of the Fokker - Planck equation . • Non - overlapping molecules : The Fokker - Planck approach assumes non - overlapping molecules , while the molecules in the present simulation can overlap . Section 4 . 4 . 2 shows how the present reaction framework can be applied to non - overlapping molecules as well . As explained in Section 4 . 2 . 3 , non - overlapping molecules increase the compu - tation time signiﬁcantly , while the effect in case of low - abundance signaling molecules is only marginal . • Distance - dependent reaction probability : The Fokker - Planck equation leads to a dis - tance dependent reaction probability ( cf . Figure 3 . 5 c ) , while the present framework yields a constant reaction probability within the critical radius . It is worth noting , that the Fokker - Planck approach requires that the molecules which did not react do not dif - fuse according to Equation ( 4 . 8 ) but obey the restrictions which are imposed by the boundary condition . That means , that the random walk step has to be calculated based on the deformed probability density function W ( r , t ) ( cf . Figure 3 . 5 b ) 11 . 11 Since the Fokker - Planck equation only describes the relative motion e . g . of molecule i with respect to molecule j , the motion of a one reactant has to be calculated based on the motion of the other molecule . Obvi - ously , a third reactant within the range of the interaction would disturb this system . 42 4 . 3 . Reactions Figure 4 . 5 : Comparison of the method employing the Fokker - Planck derived reaction probability [ 167 , 168 ] ( stochastic method I ) and the present method ( stochastic method II ) , with the result of the corresponding partial differential equation given in [ 167 , 168 ] . The underlying model describes the diffusion of active signaling molecules from the plasma membrane towards the nucleus . The ac - tive signaling molecules can be deactivated by phosphatases , so eventually only 2300 out of 4000 molecules reach the nucleus in the active state . The excerpt on the right shows the delay of the signal in the nucleus , caused by the travel time from the plasma membrane towards the nucleus . It also shows the stochastic ﬂuctuations in the stochastic methods . • Inﬂuence of obstacles : While the Fokker - Planck equation and the boundary condi - tions look simple ( cf . Figure 3 . 5 d - f ) , the resulting probability density function W ( r , t ) for the relative motion and the reaction probability require complicated calculations [ 167 , 168 ] . In principle , the Fokker - Planck approach can also be applied to reactions which describe the binding of molecules to cytoskeleton ﬁbers or the plasma membrane ( cf . Section 4 . 4 ) . However it should be noted , that the boundary conditions at intersect - ing structures can render the solution of W ( r , t ) next to these intersections impractical ( in addtion , in the random architecture of the cell , each intersection of the cytoskeleton requires an individual solution because they all occur at different angles ) . Likewise , nearby obstacles add a boundary condition for the Fokker - Planck equation describing the diffusion and reaction of two molecules . This boundary breaks the sym - metry , which hampers the calculation of the solution . In principle , each conﬁguration of nearby particles and obstacles is unique , which requires an individual solution for each encounter . ( If the boundary is however not included in W ( r , t ) , random walk steps , which are conducted based on this Fokker - Planck probability density function W ( r , t ) but would end in a nearby cytoskeleton ﬁlament , have to be rejected . This would be in a critical conﬂict with the preconditions of the Fokker - Planck ansatz . ) Also rare events like a ’collision’ of three reactants require a special treatment in the Fokker - Planck approach . While the Fokker - Planck approach is impressive by the clarity of the approach , the present method is attractive by its simplicity . The simpler approach ( i ) leads to a faster algorithm for 43 4 . SIMULATION METHOD the simulation , ( ii ) enables the use of cargo / SNARE dependent reaction / fusion rate constants ( which have to be calculated for each pair individually ) in the vesicles framework introduced in Chapter 8 , and ( iii ) is more stable considering the crowded conditions with forbidden steps . Figure 4 . 5 shows that both methods lead to equal results for the simpliﬁed signal transduction model published in Lapin et al . [ 167 , 168 ] . Due to the moderately high number of molecules the result from the stochastic models are also in agreement with the results from the corre - sponding partial differential equation model . The advantage of the particle tracking methods is , that they also show the stochastic ﬂuctuations . Remarks on Reversible Reactions and Comparison with Other Methods Many models of biochemical reactions include reversible reactions like A + B (cid:42)(cid:41) C . While the forward reaction can be modeled as described above , the reverse direction creates two molecules out of one . It can be difﬁcult to ﬁnd a valid position for the newly generated sec - ond molecule under crowded intracellular conditions . Therefore the two products are placed overlapping at the same position ( which is not restricted by obstacles since the ﬁrst molecule was at a valid position ) . This would lead to an immediate backward - backward = forward re - action between the pair – canceling any backward reaction . In the present approach however , the re - fusion of the pair is only as likely as P reactionij + Diff , leaving most pairs unaffected until the molecules had a chance to diffuse away from each other within the next timestep ( for further remarks see Section A . 5 . 5 ) . In contrast , in the Smoldyn simulation framework [ 8 ] , the two products of the backward reaction have to be placed at separated positions . Pogson et al . [ 239 ] did not specify how they handle this issue . Furthermore Pogson et al . [ 239 ] did not report the problem concerning the diffusion control of the reaction . Hence , it has to be as - sumed that in their simulations the critical reaction radius was larger than the natural collision radius . This leads to a large k apparentD (cid:29) k D , rendering the reaction not diffusion controlled : 1 / k D → 0 ⇒ k ij = k micro according to Equation ( 4 . 18 ) . Test Results , Accuracy , and Limits of the Present Method • Diffusion Limit : the macroscopic reaction rate constant must not exceed the diffusion limit k D ( which can only be calculated in 3D ) . • Accuracy : the present method works both in homogeneous , well mixed and inhomo - geneous conditions , as well as in complex interaction networks ( cf . Chapter 5 and Figure 4 . 5 ) given that the following constraints are taken into account : • Timestep constraints : obviously , a reaction probability greater than one is impossible , therefore ∆ t should be chosen so that P reactionij + Diff < 1 . Furthermore , a weak dependency on the steplength was detected . The simulation will become more sensitive to ∆ t , if the diffusion limitation is stronger ( i . e . k macro is in the range of k D ) . In this extreme 44 4 . 3 . Reactions Figure 4 . 6 : The ﬁnite size of the molecules leads to a re - stricted volume next to the surface . Due to the sterical restric - tion only the green area within the collision radius is accessi - ble ( about half of the original reaction volume ) , thus reducing the interaction volume and the interaction rate ( by about 1 / 2 ) . The initial reaction rate used to calculate the reaction prob - ability has to be doubled accordingly . The curvature of the surface can be neglected in case of the plasma membrane or the nucleus since the molecules have a much smaller ra - dius than the cellular structure . diffusion limited case nearly every collision leads to a reaction . The steplength should be reduced in the present framework which increases the number of steps and collisions within a given time interval , thus relaxing the extreme situation . Tests have shown , that P reactionij + Diff < 0 . 2 is sufﬁcient for k ij / k D ≥ 0 . 1 . For less diffusion limited reaction rates , the probability can be even higher . • Reactions close to a boundary : If one reaction partner is bound to a surface , not the complete interaction volume will be accessible by the freely diffusing reactant ( see Figure4 . 6 ) . This reduces the effective reaction rate . In order to achieve the desired macroscopic reaction rate , the reaction probability has to be adjusted accordingly by a factor which is given as ( desired volume ) / ( accessible volume ) . However , not the re - action probability has to be adjusted but already the macroscopic input reaction rate constant , based on which the microscopic reaction rate constant and the reaction prob - ability are calculated . The reduced reaction volume reduces the probability to hit the volume by diffusion , which makes the reaction more diffusion limited . This nicely un - derscores the effect of diffusion limited reactions on the one hand , and on the other hand that the present framework is able to correctly deal with this complexity ( the model in Chapter 7 includes this kind of reaction for the activation of cytosolic molecules by a plasma - membrane bound species ) . • Reﬁlling of the Reaction Volume : The present approach assumes , that the average particle density within the reaction volume equals the local particle density . During the reaction step , the number of particles within the reaction volume is reduced ( on average ) by P reactionij + Diff . If it is not reﬁlled to the local level during the diffusion step , the resulting reaction rate will be to low . During the conducted simulations this effect was not ob - served for reactions between molecules but for the interactions with cellular structures as described in Section 4 . 4 . This effect is discussed in detail in Appendix A . 5 . 1 . 45 4 . SIMULATION METHOD 4 . 4 Extension / Generalization of the Reaction Framework 4 . 4 . 1 Adsorption to a Surface and Import into the Nucleus Besides the reactions between different molecules , the agents can also interact with the cel - lular structures . Lipophilic molecules can for example unspeciﬁcally bind to membranes [ 3 , 41 ] . If the nuclear pore complex is not modeled in detail but just an import rate into the nucleus is given , this will likewise require a reaction between the nucleus ( surface ) and the respective signaling molecule . The corresponding reaction framework can be derived from the framework for particle - particle reactions . The main difference comes from the fact , that the agent must not overlap with the surface S . In addition , the surface is a two - dimensional object , which inﬂuences the deﬁni - tion of the rate constant and concentrations . The concentration of the surface c s = S / V total is deﬁned as surface per total volume with units [ µ m 2 / µ m 3 ] . The ( mass action kinetics ) balance equation that describes the change in the concentration of unbound molecules / agents dc iunbound dt = − k si c s c iunbound ( 4 . 24 ) requires , that the respective rate constant k si has the units [ µ m / s ] accordingly . The reaction volume is now given by a reaction layer above the surface as shown in Figure 4 . 7 a and b . It can be assumed , that the thickness of this layer is much smaller than the curvature of the surface . This allows deﬁning the reaction volume as V s = S × h s , where h s is the height of the reaction layer . Within this framework , h s is then h s ( k ) : = k si ∆ t ( 4 . 25 ) Figure 4 . 7 describes the algorithm for the surface reactions : If the agent is closer to the surface than the collision distance x coll , it will be reset to the old position as discussed in Section 4 . 2 . 3 . If it is inside of ( x coll , x coll + h s ] , it will react , and if the distance is greater than x coll + h s , it will move unaffectedly . As long as no reaction probability is assigned , all molecules within ( x coll , x coll + h s ] will react . The present approach assumes that the reaction volume is reﬁlled up to the average ( local ) concentration in order to yield the correct average ( local ) reaction rate . The reﬁlling of the reaction volume in the present simulation within ∆ t is described in Appendix A . 5 . 1 . The diffusion coefﬁcient determines how quickly the global particle distribution responds 46 4 . 4 . Extension / Generalization of the Reaction Framework Figure 4 . 7 : ( a ) Excluded volume and reaction volume around impenetrable objects . ( b ) Examples of interactions with impenetrable objects . ( c ) One possible testing algorithm to identify reactions and collisions in one query . The most probable result is neither a collision nor a rejection . In order to improve the performance of the simulation this case should be the one with the least computations as shown in ( d ) . to the sink at the surface , leading to a diffusion controlled reaction effect in the cell ( cf . Figure 5 . 10 ) . Finally , it should be noted , that the input reaction rate constant in the simulation is the microscopic reaction rate , because Equation ( 2 . 3 ) does not apply to reactions with a surface . 4 . 4 . 2 Bimolecular Reactions between Nonoverlapping Molecules If the spherical molecules of the simulation are not allowed to overlap , likewise a hierarchy of the interaction volumes will be created . First , the excluded volume has to be taken care of and the path of the molecules has to be adjusted . Only then , the reaction volume can be considered , and the respective reactions are executed ( cf . Figure 4 . 7 ) . The total interaction volume is : V interaction = V collision + V reaction , and the interaction distance becomes r ij ( k ) = 3 (cid:114) ( r i + r j ) 3 + 3 k ij ∆ t 4 π ( 4 . 26 ) Note that Equation ( 4 . 25 ) for surface reactions can be derived from this result if the reaction is described as the interaction of one reactant with the surface of the other ( see Appendix A . 5 . 3 ) . 47 4 . SIMULATION METHOD 4 . 4 . 3 Agent - Cytoskeleton Interactions Proteins like glycolytic enzymes can bind to cytoskeleton ﬁlaments [ 191 ] . The concept of transport with motor proteins requires as well that the respective molecules bind to a cy - toskeleton ﬁlament . The essential property of ﬁbers is their length , the ﬁber concentration c fiber is accordingly given as length / volume [ µ m / µ m 3 ] 12 . The corresponding binding con - stant k fi is accordingly deﬁned with units [ µ m 2 / s ] . In analogy to the previous section , an interaction surface per length is deﬁned , which will account for the complete interaction vol - ume if multiplied with the total ﬁber length ( descriptively , the interaction volume is chopped in slices with area A interaction along the ﬁber ) . Again , proteins cannot diffuse into ﬁbers , so at the ﬁrst level the algorithm has to check for collisions . The collision area is given by A collision = π ( r fiber + r i ) 2 , the interaction area is given by A interaction = k fi × ∆ t . The interaction radius is the radius of the combined area : r f ( k ) = (cid:114) ( r fiber + r i ) 2 + k fi ∆ t π ( 4 . 27 ) The reaction will take place if the unbound molecule outside of the excluded volume and within the reaction interval ( r fiber + r molecule , r f ( k ) ] ( cf . Figure 4 . 7 ) . The same limita - tions apply as in the previous sections , further remarks on this approach are given in Ap - pendix A . 5 . 1 . 4 . 4 . 4 First Order Reactions and Zero Order Reactions In the description of biochemical reactions also ﬁrst order kinetics of the form dc i dt = − k ( 1 ) i c i ( 4 . 28 ) are used . The constant k ( 1 ) i can be replaced by a second order reaction rate k ( 1 ) i = k ( 2 ) ij c j in order to relate it to the previous framework – given that c j = const . Then , the j molecules 12 Each molecular subunit contributing to a ﬁber has a speciﬁc length , so molecular concentrations can be converted easily to length - ’concentrations’ . 48 4 . 4 . Extension / Generalization of the Reaction Framework act as ’enzymes’ but are not converted in the reaction . However , this approach is ( i ) not consistent with the reality in the cell , and ( ii ) involves the computationally expensive handling of a reasonable number of extra j molecules as well as the calculation of all ij - distances in order to check for reactions . Instead , Equation ( 4 . 28 ) can be discretized like Equation ( 4 . 13 ) : ∆ N i ∆ t = − k ( 1 ) i N i ( 4 . 29 ) The probability that a molecule of species i reacts within [ t , t + ∆ t ] is given by the fraction ∆ N i / N i and from Equation ( 4 . 29 ) it can be deduced that the probability is to ﬁrst order in ∆ t P ( 1 ) i = ∆ N i N i = − k ( 1 ) i ∆ t ( 4 . 30 ) More accurate the probability has to be P ( 1 ) i = 1 − exp ( − k ( 1 ) i ∆ t ) ( 4 . 31 ) in order to account for the change of N i within the discrete step ∆ t [ 8 ] . Again , ∆ t has to be small enough so that P ( 1 ) i < 1 . In every timestep and for every molecule i a uniform random number ξ ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] is compared to P ( 1 ) i . If ξ < P ( 1 ) i , the molecule will react . Zero Order Reactions Zero order reactions create molecules out of nothing with a constant rate . This can only be modeled in the following way : Species Z is created from source molecules in the ﬁrst order reaction Source → Source + Z ( the number of source molecules is constant ) . The continuum balance equation would be : dc Z dt = k ( 1 ) Z c Source = k ( 0 ) Z ( 4 . 32 ) where the ﬁrst order rate constant has to be k ( 1 ) Z = k ( 0 ) Z / c Source in order to reproduce the intended zero order reaction rate constant . Newly created Z molecules are placed at the current position of the source molecule in the simulation . 49 4 . SIMULATION METHOD 4 . 4 . 5 Enzymatic Reactions and the Michaelis - Menten - Kinetics Biochemical reactions are often based on enzymatic conversions as shown above . The re - spective continuum approach uses the Michaelis - Menten kinetics to describe the reaction rate r [ 26 ] . The interaction between substrate and enzyme molecules is a bimolecular reaction ( allthough this fact is masked if the enzyme concentration is lumped into V max : = k cat × c E ) . A comparison with Section 4 . 3 . 1 leads to the conclusion that the respective bimolecular reac - tion rate constant looks like k ES : = − k cat K M + c S ( 4 . 33 ) which is not a constant any more but depends on the substrate concentration c S . The sim - ulation , however , does not access concentrations but only collisions between molecules . Still , the c S - dependent reduction of the reaction rate can also be explained by a maximal turnover of substrate by each enzyme . Or , in other words : a ﬁnite time is needed for each conversion . Based on the latter view , modeling of enzymatic reactions becomes possible in the following way : • The reaction always happens with the maximal possible bimolecular reaction rate con - stant k maxES = k cat / K M , which can be derived from Equation ( 4 . 33 ) for c S → 0 . • After a reaction occurred , the respective enzyme is blocked for the turnover - time τ : = 1 / k cat . Thus the framework accounts for the saturation of the reaction rate . Figure 4 . 8 : Comparison between the or - dinary differential equation dc S / dt = − r , dc P / dt = + r with r = k cat c E c S / ( K M + c S ) , solved with Matlab ode45 and the stochas - tic simulation based on the same param - eters ( 5000 enzyme and 100000 substrate molecules ) . 50 4 . 4 . Extension / Generalization of the Reaction Framework Thus the bimolecular reaction framework developed in Section 4 . 3 . 1 can also be used for en - zymatic reactions based on the Michaelis - Menten kinetics . It uses the rate constant k maxES = k cat / K M . Enzymes that are still blocked from a previous reaction cannot participate in reac - tions . For simplicity , the product is created right when the reaction happens and not at t + τ . In order to get comparable results between the simulation and the Michaelis - Menten kinetics shown above , an initial random waiting time between 0 and τ has to be assigned to every enzyme 13 . Figure 4 . 8 shows the comparison between the two approaches and no signiﬁcant differences . This example is mentioned here , because it exempliﬁes the crucial difference that arise from the event based framework : there is no concentration , there are just particles and events . Of course the average time between the events can vary depending on the number of particles , but the dependency is not as straightforward as in the continuum approach . 4 . 4 . 6 Clustering Besides the reactions between two molecules , many cellular compounds form larger objects and clusters , for example receptors in the plasma membrane [ 94 ] . The bimolecular reaction framework developed in Section 4 . 3 . 1 was also extended in order to include the clustering of molecules . Since clustering is modeled within the two - dimensional plasma membrane , all calculations are based on a 2D model . A spherical cluster is assumed , and the radius of a cluster consisting of n molecules is estimated based on the surface A cluster = n × A receptor which leads to : r cluster = √ n × r receptor ( 4 . 34 ) The framework works in the following way : • All clusters start with n = 1 ( a cluster seed molecule at a ﬁxed location ) . • The reaction probability for molecules that are within the critical distance is calculated at the beginning for the interaction of one seed molecule with one receptor as in Equa - tion ( 4 . 23 ) . 13 Likewise the Michaelis - Menten kinetics assumes , that the number of enzyme - substrate complexes is in a steady - state , which does not hold in the beginning [ 26 ] . If the natural dynamics of the enzymatic reaction is important for the model , the reaction should be constructed by the set of forward and backward ( mass action ) reactions with the rate constants k + 1 , k − 1 , andk cat , describing enzyme and substrate binding , unbinding and the conversion as shown above . This involves three reactions instead of one and thus increases the computation time . 51 4 . SIMULATION METHOD Figure 4 . 9 : Clustering of 5000 receptors around 100 cluster - seeds at 2 , 7 and 14 s respectively with a clustering rate constant of k cluster = 1 × 10 22 µ m 2 mol − 1 s − 1 ( which equals 10 mm 2 fmol − 1 s − 1 as reported by [ 94 ] ) in a cell with a radius of 2 . 5 µ m . The number of receptors corresponds to a concen - tration of 4 . 22 × 10 − 22 mol µ m − 2 in this cell . • The corresponding reaction rate constant k clustering has to be given in µ m 2 mol − 1 s − 1 for the two dimensional geometry and represents the microscopic reaction rate constant because no k D - value can be speciﬁed in 2D ( cf . Section 2 . 5 ) . • The reaction probability is held constant throughout the process while the interaction radius around the seed molecule is increased with every new molecule in the cluster according to r clusteringij = (cid:0) √ n + 1 (cid:1) × r receptor ( 4 . 35 ) where the + 1 corresponds to the radius of the free receptors or the index i while j and the √ n corresponds to the cluster . • Upon a reaction , the number of molecules in the cluster is updated : n new = n + 1 . The free molecule becomes a part of the cluster and stops moving . Figure 4 . 9 shows a time series of membrane receptor clustering simulated with the present simulation . 4 . 5 Reactions within Cellular Compartments Reactions are not restricted to the cytosol but can happen everywhere in the cell , for example in the nucleus . Likewise membrane bound proteins of the upstream part of the signaling cascade can react with each other . Within the given scope of the simulation , it is sufﬁcient to track the number of these molecules but not their position within the nucleus or the plasma membrane . This is needed in order to • generate input signals for the signaling cascade in the cytoplasm • model reactions in the nucleus and also the nuclear export 52 4 . 5 . Reactions within Cellular Compartments • provide a buffer of particles which are bound e . g . to the plasma membrane . Within each compartment the concentration of the particle numbers can be evaluated because the number and the volume are known . Then the evolution could be tracked with a con - tinuous ODE system . However within the present particle tracking algorithm the discrete and stochastic Gillespie algorithm [ 99 ] is used in order to match the stochastic , event - based framework . 4 . 5 . 1 Coupling of the Particle and Gillespie Tracking Method The Gillespie algorithm is directly implemented in the simulation framework as described by Gillespie [ 99 ] ( cf . Section 3 . 3 . 1 ) . That means that the time for the next reaction is calculated as τ = 1 a × ln 1 ξ 1 with a : = (cid:88) i a i ( 4 . 36 ) 14 where the a i = k i N i for ﬁrst order reactions , a i = k i N i N j / V compartment for second order reactions ( and so on ) , denote the reaction propensity of the i th reaction . ξ 1 is a random number from the uniform distribution . At t + τ the next reaction is executed , where the reaction is selected out of the list of possible reactions by summing up the different a i values until the sum equals or exceeds the value a × ξ 2 ( where ξ 2 is another random number from the uniform distriubtion ) . Thus the execution of the reactions is random and weighted with their reaction propensities . Afterwards the time is set to the new time t : = t + τ and the next τ and index of the next reaction is calculated as described above . In the present simulation the Gillespie algorithm can be running in all static agents except the cytoskeleton ( i . e . plasma membrane , nucleus , and all crowding agents ) in parallel . A dynamically updated linked list contains the compartments in an ascending order of their next reaction time . As soon as the time in the simulation reaches the ﬁrst time point in the list , the reaction is executed in the respective compartment , the next reaction time for the compartment is calculated , and the list is accordingly updated ( the next time point in the list becomes the new ﬁrst time point ) . Within one timestep of the simulation also several Gillespie - reactions can occur . The Gillespie framework has to be coupled with the particle tracking in the cytoplasm . For example , a mobile ( signaling molecule ) agent could enter the nucleus in a nucleo - cytoplasmic shuttling reaction by binding to the nucleus as described in Section 4 . 4 . 1 . The respective agent will then be destroyed in the particle tracking framework and the number of signaling molecules in the nucleus will be increased by one . The reactions of this particular molecule 14 Time of the next reaction : Note that τ denotes the time span from the current time to the next reaction . If comparing the times when next reactions will occur the current times ( i . e . when evaluating τ ) have to be added accordingly . 53 4 . SIMULATION METHOD have to be added to the Gillespie reactions in the nucleus : • The time τ ∗ for reactions of that given molecule have to be calculated based on Equa - tion ( 4 . 36 ) . But the reactions of the respective molecule species have to be evaluated with N = 1 instead of the number of all molecules of that species in the involved reaction propensities a i . Only the new molecule has to be considered . The reaction propensities of reactions where the molecule is not involved have to be set to zero . • This new reaction ∗ now competes with the reaction that was determined to be the next reaction in the independent / unperturbed Gillespie method within the compartment and should occur at τ . • Only if τ ∗ < τ ( or no reaction was assigned in the compartment ) , the new particle will alter the course of events in the compartment . Then the time for the next reaction is replaced by τ ∗ and a reaction of the new molecule is executed next . All lists have to be updated accordingly . Otherwise the precalculated reaction in the compartment will be executed at τ . In all subsequent reactions the new molecule will be accounted for as well in the reaction propensities a i and thus is successfully integrated in the process . The reverse shuttling reaction is much simpler . If the ﬁrst order shuttling rate from the nu - cleus into the cytoplasm is executed by the Gillespie algorithm , a new mobile agent is created at the surface of the respective compartment ( in this example the nucleus ) . The number of signaling molecules is reduced by one in the nucleus , and all lists are updated accordingly . It is important to note , that the mobile particle tracking agent is created at a random po - sition along the surface of the compartment . Therefore this approach is not applied to the cytoskeleton ﬁlaments . Molecules which transiently bind to them could be recreated upon dissociation on the other end of the ﬁlament , which introduces a huge and artiﬁcial dis - placement of the molecules . For the same reason this approach is also not applicable for signaling complexes in the plasma membrane that should have a speciﬁc polarized distribu - tion . Also molecule species at the surface of a compartment that are supposed to interact with cytoplasmic molecules ( the mobile agents ) , have to be modeled as mobile agents with a speciﬁc position as well ( for instance in the MAPK signal transduction model in Chap - ter 7 / Appendix D . 3 . 1 ) . 4 . 6 Possible Applications Beyond Signal Transduction The agent - based framework allows a simple extension of the simulation to other problems in biology . Three examples are listed below . 54 4 . 6 . Possible Applications Beyond Signal Transduction 4 . 6 . 1 Vesicle Transport Vesicles are membrane enclosed transport containers that connect the membrane enclosed or - ganelles of the cell [ 3 ] . From an object - oriented perspective the vesicles are likewise particles . But the vesicles contain cargo molecules , which can be modeled in a multi - scale framework . Accordingly , the vesicles are tracked through the cell like molecules . The number of cargo molecules in the vesicles is processed in an additional layer of the simulation . Further routines govern the interactions of the vesicle - agents . This extension is presented in Chapter 8 . 4 . 6 . 2 Diffusion through a Solid Tumor The agent - based concept of the simulation allows a simple redeﬁnition of the objects to other scales , and therefore a completely new simulation environment as shown below : Original Deﬁnition = ⇒ New Deﬁnition Cell = ⇒ Tissue Cytoskeleton = ⇒ Extracellular matrix Crowding agents = ⇒ Cells of the tissue Nucleus = ⇒ N / A Instead of looking into one cell , the simulation framework now represents a tissue – for ex - ample a solid tumor [ 77 ] . This framework can be used to analyze the diffusive transport of drugs or metabolites into the tumor . The simulation reveals not only a gradient on the radial axis of the tumor but also around all pores of the blood vessels from which the molecules extravasate ( see Figure 4 . 10 ) [ 77 ] . In addition , the lifelines of all the cells in the tissue could be tracked individually by the implemented Gillespie method for the static objects . Figure 4 . 10 : A detailed model of drug diffusion through extracellular space of a small solid tumor ( diameter of 1 . 2 mm ) . The advanced visualization technology developed by Falk et al . [ 77 ] enables an interactive visualization despite the high number of objects ( about 100 , 000 spherical cells , 900 , 000 cylindrical ﬁlaments and 150 , 000 drug molecules ) .

Tracer particles ( shown as dark spots ) diffuse through the network , starting from the center . Obviously , not all tubes are interconnected . Vi - sualized with POV - Ray as de - scribed in Appendix C using semi - transparent cylinders . Figure 4 . 12 : The ’inverse’ excluded volume leads to a tubular network . Note , that the logic for the diffusing molecules changes from must be outside of all structures to must be inside of at least one structure . 4 . 6 . 3 Diffusion through a Tubular Network So far , the simulation focused on the transport of objects through the crowded and compart - mentalized intracellular space . In addition , it can be important to look at the diffusion within the cellular compartments , for instance the tubular network of the Endoplasmic Reticulum ( ER ) [ 220 ] . Also the blood vessel system comprises a tubular network . The simulation framework is implemented in a way that allows switching the forbidden vol - ume of a structure from inside to outside ( see Figure 4 . 12 . The cylinders which so far rep - resented the cytoskeleton will then form a tubular network like the ER or the blood vascular system 15 . Note , that the plasma membrane is also modeled as an ’inverse’ structure , because the test molecules must stay within the boundaries of the plasma membrane . Figure 4 . 11 shows how tracers diffuse through a random tubular network . Not all tubes are interconnected , the tube density is below the percolation threshold . Therefore the tracers can not reach all tubes of the network . 15 In the context of modeling the blood vascular system the local velocity of the blood should be added to the random movement of the tracer molecules in ∆ (cid:126)x from Equation ( 4 . 7 ) as ∆ (cid:126)x = ∆ (cid:126)x ( D 0 , ∆ t ) + (cid:126)v field × ∆ t [ 88 , 166 ] . 56 4 . 7 . Discussion 4 . 7 Discussion The present simulation framework provides a functional and ﬂexible simulation environment to track molecules through a detailed model cell . The simulation is able to • track molecules through a model cell which contains a detailed microscopic cytoskele - ton structure • include the action of motor proteins by which the molecules are transported along the cytoskeleton in a speciﬁc direction • handle a multitude of reaction schemes between molecules as well as molecules and cellular structures , which are needed to model signal transduction processes . Thus the developed framework is well suited to simulate signal transduction in a realistic in silico environment . In addition , the simulation can be used to investigate the inﬂuence of the intracellular conditions on diffusion and reaction rates ( cf . Chapter 5 ) . The framework also allows implementing more complex cellular processes like vesicle transport which is shown in Chapter 8 . Furthermore the object - oriented structures of the simulation can be re - scaled and re - deﬁned in order to analyze the diffusion of drugs through the extracellular space , tubu - lar systems . ( cf . Figure 4 . 10 and 4 . 11 ) . The following sections highlight the advantage of the present discrete and stochastic sim - ulation over continuous and deterministic differential equations as well as its superior spa - tiotemporal resolution . Appendix A includes additional information about the accuracy of the diffusion and reaction model . Appendix B lists the steps which were taken in order to optimize the performance of the simulation . 4 . 7 . 1 Advantage over Continuum Simulations Most obviously , the particle tracking and event - based simulation preserves the natural stochas - ticity both of the random walk of the molecules and the reactions between them . This can be an important fact especially in the context of low abundance signaling molecules [ 207 , 253 , 289 ] . Furthermore the simulation does not neglect the spatial aspects like ODE models . And while PDE models assume a homogeneous space , the present simulation is able to include the in - homogeneous intracellular structures . If these structures are supposed to be modeled in a PDE models , the resulting boundary conditions of the random cellular architecture will most probably render the solution of the PDE impossible ( since space has to be discretized for a numerical solution [ 156 ] , probably more meshes than molecules have to be tracked ! ) . The collision based reaction framework also preserves the inﬂuence of the obstructed diffu - sion on the reaction rate . This reﬂects the properties of the complex in vivo reaction kinetics 57 4 . SIMULATION METHOD and can be used to analyze the differences between in vitro and in vivo results . Finally , the present framework allows showing and analyzing the local stochastic ﬂuctuations in the protein concentrations ( cf . Figure 6 . 1 ) . Such a pattern could also be obtained by solving the corresponding stochastic differential equations ( SDE ) , however at the spatial resolution of the particle tracking framework the number of meshes and the corresponding computation time again render the SDE - approach impractical . 4 . 7 . 2 Spatial and Temporal Resolution of the Simulation The temporal resolution of dynamic processes is governed by ∆ t in the simulation . Processes below this timescale are not correctly resolved . Likewise the spatial resolution is given by ∆ x . ∆ x and ∆ t are coupled via Equation ( 4 . 8 ) for diffusing tracer molecules . The spatial resolution should be adjusted to the spatial structures and the respective particle size of the tracer molecules in order to resolve effects like the hindrance in diffusion by the cytoskeleton correctly . ∆ t is in the range of microseconds for structures and particles in the nm - range and a diffusion coefﬁcient of D = 1 µ m 2 / s . This ∆ t is much faster than the reaction dynam - ics which is supposed to be modeled in this simulation . Therefore the use of the reaction scheme described in Section 4 . 3 . 1 is justiﬁed . With respect to the reactions it should be noted however , that more diffusion limited reactions require a smaller ∆ t in order to be resolved correctly with the present method . A smaller timestep , in contrast , requires more computation time , or in other words : computation energy . Altogether this is an interesting analogy with the resolution of microscopes , where the spa - tiotemporal resolution as well depends on the wavelength / frequency / energy [ 317 ] . So far , the combined spatiotemporal resolution of the simulation is much better than any microscopic method [ 82 , 92 , 289 ] . This advantage is even more obvious if the images of the interactive visualization framework is compared with the low contrast of biological probes and limited labeling possibilities in optical microscopy [ 5 , 77 , 98 , 200 , 276 ] . The resolution of the mod - eling framework could be furthermore improved below the sub - nanometer scale by switching to a Molecular Dynamics Simulation – if necessary . 58 Chapter 5 Modeling the in vivo Conditions in silico : Effective Diffusion and Reaction Rates 1 This chapter aims at elucidating the effect of the intracellular conditions on diffusion and reaction rates . Obviously , the obstacles in the cell reduce the mobility of molecules . This 1 Parts of this chapter are publication as : M . T . Klann , A . Lapin , and M . Reuss .

MODELING THE IN VIVO CONDITIONS IN SILICO effect will be analyzed ﬁrst . Secondly , the effect on reaction rates will be analyzed . The differences between the rate constant in the ’macroscopic’ , homogenized , well - mixed mass action kinetics framework and the present , detailed , ’microscopic’ simulation will be traced back to the intracellular conditions causing it . These factors have to be analyzed before apply - ing the present simulation to signal - transduction in the cell in order to understand differences between the results of the present simulation and models based on ordinary differential equa - tions . 5 . 1 Introducing a Model Cell First , a model cell has to be set up which has a structured and crowded environment similar to the in vivo conditions , as introduced in Section 2 . 3 . Figure 5 . 1 shows the virtual cell which is used to test reactions under these model ’in vivo’ conditions . It has a diameter of 7 µ m 2 . The cytoskeleton / microtrabecular lattice consists of 25 , 000 cylindrical ﬁlaments with a length of 2 . 5 µ m and a diameter of 35 nm . The larger diameter compared to the original cytoskeleton ﬁlaments of actin and microtubules can be explained by ﬁlament bundling and all the proteins that are bound to the cytoskeleton [ 17 , 222 , 321 ] . The model cell also contains 100 , 000 immobile crowding spheres with a diameter of 60 nm 3 . The ﬁbers altogether occupy a volume fraction of 19 . 5 % and the crowding spheres 6 . 1 % 4 . Both crowding species taken together occupy 24 . 41 % , which is less than the sum of both fractions ( 25 . 61 % ) because the spheres can overlap with the cylinders . Equation ( 4 . 1 ) from Section 4 . 1 . 2 can be resorted to (cid:15) crowding = (cid:15) spheres + (cid:15) cylinders − ( (cid:15) spheres × (cid:15) cylinders ) ( 5 . 1 ) and the calculation yields 24 . 42 % which is well in agreement with the Monte Carlo mea - surement of the combined volume fraction . The cytoskeleton volume fraction of this in silico cell is within the range of 15 - 20 % reported by Gershon et al . [ 95 ] and the total crowding is within the in vivo 20 - 30 % interval [ 75 ] . For a small tracer molecule with a radius of 2 . 5 nm the excluded volume increases to 30 . 5 % ( 7 . 7 % for the spheres and 24 . 8 % for the cylinders alone ) due to the sterical restrictions . 2 The nucleus has a diameter of 2 . 5 µ m , the respective nuclear volume has to be deducted from the cytoplas - mic volume . 3 It is impossible to reach the same volume fraction with a reasonable number of smaller spheres . Already with spheres of half the diameter , the eight - fold number of spheres for the same volume is needed . Therefore the given values have been chosen with respect to the computational performance . 4 Measured with the Monte Carlo test described in Section 3 . 2 . 1 . The simulation also calculates the total length of the cylinders inside the cell without the parts that would reach across the plasma membrane . The remaining average length of the cylinders is 1 . 62 µ m . This is in agreement with the model calculation of Equa - tion ( 4 . 6 ) which predicts the very same value . Likewise , the spheres are partly located outside of the cell , and 60 5 . 2 . Effective Diffusion in the Cell Figure 5 . 2 : Effective diffusion is affected by the variation of the cytoskeleton parameters : ( a ) r f = 12 . 5 nm ; L f = 500 nm ; volume fraction = 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 , and 25 % . ( b ) Volume fraction = 15 % ; L f = 500 nm ; r f = 7 . 5 , 12 . 5 , and 17 . 5 nm ; ( c ) Volume fraction = 15 % ; r f = 12 . 5 nm ; L f = 50 , 100 , 200 , and 500 nm ( reproduced from [ 152 ] ) . 5 . 2 Effective Diffusion in the Cell In general , the crowding structures in the cell reduce the diffusion of tracer molecules . The relative effective diffusion ratio D eff / D 0 in the model cell was analyzed with the approach introduced in Section 4 . 2 . 3 . It yields a moderate reduction of D eff / D 0 = 0 . 77 for tracer particles with a radius of 2 . 5 nm . The simulation framework was also used to analyze the effective diffusion in several cellular architectures for inert tracer molecules . Furthermore a transient binding interaction was intro - duced , which leads to temporarily immobilized molecules that are bound to the cytoskeleton structures . For a complete analysis of the hindered diffusion through the cytoplasm all pa - rameters like the hydrodynamic radius of the particles , the radius , length and number of the cytoskeleton ﬁlaments or the crowding spheres , as well as the fraction of unbound molecules can be changed individually in the simulation . 5 . 2 . 1 Inert Tracers in a Static Cytoskeleton 5 First , the inﬂuence of the cytoskeleton volume fraction on the effective diffusion is explored . An increase of the cytoskeleton volume fraction leads to a reduced diffusion ( Figure 5 . 2 a ) . the same approach yields that effectively only 99 , 608 spheres are ( fully ) located in the cell . 5 Parts of this section have been published as : M . T . Klann , A . Lapin , and M . Reuss . Stochastic Simulation of Signal Transduction : Impact of the Cellular Architecture on Diffusion . Biophysical Journal , 96 ( 12 ) : 5122 - 5129 , 2009 . 61 5 . MODELING THE IN VIVO CONDITIONS IN SILICO Figure 5 . 3 : Comparison of the simulated effective Diffusion and experimental data from Luby - Phelps and Weisiger [ 183 ] : Cytoskeleton volume fraction = 15 % and 20 % respectively . The simulation data were multiplied by the following values in order to take into account molecular crowding ( ( i ) : D eff / D 0 = 0 . 37 as reported by Hou et al . [ 127 ] , ( ii ) : D crowdingeff / D 0 = exp ( − 0 . 035 · 124 0 . 64 · r 0 . 16 tracer ) as reported by Luby - Phelps and Weisiger [ 183 ] . Reproduced from [ 152 ] . Secondly the properties of individual ﬁlaments are altered . Smaller ﬁber diameters and hence smaller single ﬁlament volume fraction require a higher number of ﬁlaments to reproduce the same cytoskeleton volume fraction . This leads to a reduction in the mesh size of the ﬁl - ament network and thus decreases the diffusion of larger molecules ( Figure 5 . 2 b ) . In order to obtain a particular ﬁber volume fraction , the necessary number of ﬁbers N fiber increases proportional to r − 2 fiber . For each ﬁber and a given tracer particle the excluded volume grows proportional to ( r fiber + r tracer ) 2 . For large tracer particles this term is dominated by r tracer ; thus for the complete cytoskeleton structure and for large tracers the increase of the excluded volume strongly depends on r − 2 fiber . The same is true for variations of the ﬁber length , except that the ﬁber volume linearly depends on the length . Accordingly , the effect of ﬁber length variation is less pronounced than that of ﬁber radius variation ( cf . Figure 5 . 2b and c ) . In order to compare the simulation with measured in vivo data , the volume fraction of a mi - crotubule model cytoskeleton was adjusted to 15 % and then to 20 % ( the range reported by Gershon et al . [ 95 ] ) . Molecular crowding by other macromolecules which themselves are moving and diffusing was not included in this simulation . To my knowledge there is no experimental data available expressing only the cytoskeleton in its in vivo structure without molecular crowding . For the comparison of the simulation data with the measured in vivo tracer diffusion ( including both cytoskeleton and crowding ) , the effect of crowding had to be added accordingly . This was achieved by multiplying the relative effective diffusion coefﬁ - cients [ 127 ] : D celleff D 0 = (cid:32) D skeletoneff D 0 (cid:33) × (cid:32) D crowdingeff D 0 (cid:33) ( 5 . 2 ) This holds as long as the effect of the cytoskeleton on the crowding molecules does only marginally affect the crowding molecules’ effect on the tracer molecules – i . e . the two effects 62 5 . 2 . Effective Diffusion in the Cell Figure 5 . 4 : ( a ) Comparison of theoretical predictions with simulated data ( spheres in a simple cubic lattice , a simple ’square’ cytoskeleton structure [ 28 ] and the model cytoskeleton constructed of ran - dom and overlapping cylinders in various architectures ) . Note that the simulation results are multiplied by the free volume fraction to be comparable with the theoretical results ( volume averaging ) . ( b ) Tran - sient anomalous diffusion : the temporal development of (cid:10) x 2 ( t ) (cid:11) for tracer particles with an assumed D 0 = 1 µ m 2 / s in a model cytoskeleton with volume fraction = 15 % ; r f = 12 . 5 nm . The tracer radius increases in 10 nm steps from 0 to 60 nm . In the log - log representation , the transient anomalous de - velopment eventually led to equal slopes , but shifted curves in the normal diffusion regime . Tracers with a radius ≥ 50 nm were caged and eventually showed a constant (cid:10) x 2 ( t ) (cid:11) . Reproduced from [ 152 ] . can be decoupled . Experimental in vitro results show that this multiplication is possible for the combination of separate cytoskeleton and molecular crowding effects [ 127 ] . The value for D crowdingeff / D 0 was set to ( i ) D crowdingeff / D 0 = 0 . 37 as reported by Hou et al . [ 127 ] – cf . Equation ( 3 . 12 ) and ( ii ) according to Equation ( 3 . 13 ) which was reported by Luby - Phelps and Weisiger [ 183 ] . Figure 5 . 3 shows that , independent of the method used to include molec - ular crowding , the model cytoskeleton occupying 20 % of the volume is most congruent with the experimental data obtained by Luby - Phelps and Weisiger [ 183 ] . Considering the necessary volume averaging [ 328 ] the effective diffusion results from the simulation can be compared with the theoretical predictions of Maxwell [ 194 ] – cf . Equa - tion ( 3 . 10 ) – and Weissberg [ 325 ] – cf . Equation ( 3 . 11 ) . Figure 5 . 4 shows this comparison and an overall agreement between simulations and theory . Furthermore it shows the com - parison between different obstacle types and structures , namely spheres in a regular simple cubic lattice and the tubular network in the square geometry used by Blum et al . [ 28 ] ( cf . Ap - pendix A . 3 . 1 ) . The effective diffusion through the spherical obstacles is closest to the theory – which was developed for spherical obstacles . Only at low volume fractions the results differ because ﬁnally the spheres form a cage and trap the tracer particles , while the theory predicts always a nonzero effective diffusion . The more tubular networks of the square geometry as well as the elongated cylinders of the cytoskeleton show stronger deviations from the theory for low free volume fractions . Since these structures are somewhat similar , the diffusion re - 63 5 . MODELING THE IN VIVO CONDITIONS IN SILICO Figure 5 . 5 : ( a ) Setup of the transient binding interaction ( b ) Diffusion rises proportionally to the fraction of unbound molecules . ( c ) Non - linearity induced by the dynamics of the reversible binding process . k diss = 2 . 5 1 / s ; 10 1 / s ; 25 1 / s ; 100 1 / s ; from top to bottom , the correspond - ing k binding = 2 . 6 1 / s ; 10 . 4 1 / s ; 26 1 / s ; 104 1 / s ; leads to fu = 0 . 51 . sults of both structures are equal . Still , both models differ strongly at the lowest free volume fraction . The square network can never trap particles and therefore the results become similar to the non trapping prediction of Maxwell [ 194 ] and Weissberg [ 325 ] while the more realistic model cytoskeleton strongly obstructs the diffusion . This shows , that the hindrance in the diffusion does not only depend on the excluded or free volume fraction respectively but also on the structure and architecture of the network . As shown in the previous section , the excluded volume fraction for a given molecule radius can be calculated based on Equation ( 4 . 5 ) . Future studies could reveal the dependency of D eff / D 0 on the excluded volume fraction for all kinds of different structures . Together with the calculated excluded volume fraction for a given molecule the effective diffusion could thus be predicted . However , the radius needed is not the actual molecular radius but the hy - drodynamic radius which averages over possibly non spherical molecule geometries and also includes the hydration shell around the molecule . Finally it is worth noting , that the studies of different volume fractions and cytoskeleton pa - rameters also revealed transient anomalous subdiffusion ( see Figure 5 . 4b ) , which was also observed by other groups [ 215 , 267 ] . This holds as well for the simulation within the square network presented by Blum et al . [ 28 ] ( cf . Appendix A . 3 . 1 ) . 5 . 2 . 2 Traps and Transient Binding Effects Transient binding of tracer molecules to static structures temporarily stops their motion ( see Figure 5 . 5 a ) [ 95 ] . The effective diffusion is therefore reduced further . Figure 5 . 5 b shows 64 5 . 3 . Effective Reaction Rates in a Cell that the effective diffusion coefﬁcient in the model cell environment ( see Section 5 . 1 ) is pro - portional to the fraction of unbound molecules fu , or in other terms : D eff D 0 = D skeletoneff D 0 × fu ( 5 . 3 ) More general , the average diffusion rate of the molecules can be obtained by summing up the mobility of the different states , weighted with the relative abundance of the state : D avg = D unbound × N unbound N unbound + N bound + D bound × N bound N unbound + N bound ( 5 . 4 ) D bound = 0 because the bound molecules are immobile . N unbound / ( N unbound + N bound ) is just the fraction of unbound molecules fu . Inserting these results in Equation ( 5 . 4 ) directly leads to Equation ( 5 . 3 ) . Therefore it can be stated that the diffusion of molecules which are ( partly ) subject to transient binding can be described with the average diffusion of the different states . If initially all molecules are in the unbound state , it will take some time until the steady state fu has established . This time is governed by the rate constants of the binding and unbinding process . During this time the fu changes and according to Equation ( 5 . 3 ) the diffusion coefﬁcient will be altered as well . Figure 5 . 5 c shows the changing fu and the respective displacement of the molecules (cid:104) ( x ( t ) − x ( 0 ) ) 2 (cid:105) , which should rise linearly for normal diffusion . However , it rises nonlinear as long as the fraction of unbound molecules changes . 5 . 3 Effective Reaction Rates in a Cell This section aims at elucidating the effects of the crowded intracellular conditions on the dif - fusion ( collision ) controlled bimolecular reactions for instance of signaling molecules [ 289 ] . Molecular crowding affects reactions on the one hand by reducing the overall mobility of all molecules , which reduces the probability for a collision and hence the probability for a subsequent reaction . On the other hand the reduced available volume leads to an increased effective concentration of the molecules of interest , which increases the collision probability [ 320 , 333 ] . On top of these two opposing effects , molecules close to an obstacle are not freely accessible from all sides , which again reduces the probability for a collision . Furthermore , a transient or permanent subdiffusive mobility of the molecules in the crowded intracellular environment leads to a time dependent diffusion rate . Accordingly , the reaction rate can become time dependent as well – a fact that is reﬂected in fractal reaction kinetics [ 11 , 19 , 22 , 107 , 118 , 269 ] . The rate ’constant’ becomes k ( t ) = k 0 t − h where h is the fractal kinetics exponent [ 22 ] . Even if the ensemble of molecules shows a static average diffusion , 65 5 . MODELING THE IN VIVO CONDITIONS IN SILICO the inherent anomalous behavior of every single molecule might still affect the reaction rates . The multitude of effects makes it nearly impossible to predict the effective in vivo reaction rate from the isolated in vitro behavior of the molecules . The following sections will adjust different parameters step by step from a diluted to a crowded in vivo environment in the sim - ulation in order separate the effects . Thus the simulation can help to bridge the gap between the in vivo and in vitro reaction rates . 5 . 3 . 1 Simulation Setup and the ’in vitro’ Reaction Rate The reaction rate can be accessed from the change in the number of molecules . The noise in a stochastic simulation , however , hampers the identiﬁcation of the current reaction rate . If the considered species is , in turn , created and destroyed by two reactions , it will accumulate to a dynamic equilibrium steady state . Averaging the steady state number over time reduces the stochastic noise in the result . This situation can be found in vivo in the sequence of enzymatic reactions , for example in glycolysis as shown in Figure 5 . 6 . In order to reduce the complexity , the considered substrate species S is created in a zero order reaction with rate constant k 1 . It is consumed in the enzymatic reaction S + E → P + E , which is modeled here with mass action kinetics based on the rate constant k 2 . The number of enzymes E ( concentration c E ) is not affected by this reaction . c E is set to 2 × 10 − 7 mol / l ( 20600 molecules ) . The macroscopic balance equation for the substrate concentration is in this model dc S dt = r 1 − r 2 = + k 1 − k 2 c E c S ( 5 . 5 ) which leads to the equilibrium steady state c ( eq ) S = k 1 k 2 c E ( 5 . 6 ) In the present particle - tracking framework , two molecules will react only if they collide . The corresponding observable macroscopic reaction rate constant k 2 = k macro can be broken down into the collicion rate k D and the microscopic reaction rate k micro , which describes the fraction of collisions that lead to a reaction ( see Section 2 . 5 ) . The collision rate depends solely on the diffusion coefﬁcient and the radius of the reactants , and thus provides an overall scaling factor for bimolecular reactions . In three dimensions it is : k D = 4 π ( r E + r S ) ( D E + D S ) . A molecular radius of r E = r S = 2 . 5 nm and a diffusion coefﬁcient of 1 µ m 2 / s is used in the present study . This leads to k D = 7 . 57 × 10 7 l / ( mol · s ) . The chosen macroscopic reaction rate can be given as a fraction of k D allowing a dimensionless survey of effects on the reaction rate . In the following , rates of k 2 = 7 . 57 × 10 5 l / ( mol · s ) ( 1 % of k D ) , k 2 = 7 . 57 × 10 6 l / ( mol · s ) ( 10 % of k D ) , and k 2 = 2 . 27 × 10 7 l / ( mol · s ) ( 30 % of k D ) are tested . 66 5 . 3 . Effective Reaction Rates in a Cell Figure 5 . 6 : Principle setup of the reaction testing framework ( e . g . in a metabolic pathway ) based on mass action kinetics . The rates r 1 and r 2 determine the steady state number of molecules N ( eq ) S of the metabolite pool as shown in the plot . The agent - based simulation leads to the same result but contains the intrinsic stochastic ﬂuctuations ( here mean and standard deviation of 5 independent simulations is shown ) . The simulation in the crowded ’in vivo’ cell leads to a reduced steady state N ( eq ) S invivo – obviously the bimolecular reaction rate r 2 has changed to r 2 , eff under these conditions . The text shows , how the corresponding k 2 , eff for the macroscopic balance equation can be obtained . Indeed the simulation returns the given in vitro reaction rate if no crowding molecules are present with an error of less than 2 % ( see Figure 5 . 6 for one example as well as the data in Appendix D . 2 ) . This ’in vitro’ steady state concentration ( Equation 5 . 6 ) – based on the unperturbed rate constant k 2 – is used as reference value c ∗ S in the following analysis . 5 . 3 . 2 Reactions in the Crowded Environment In order to analyze the spatial and mobility effects , the same microscopic reaction rate con - stant ( which describes the reaction probability upon a collision ) was chosen for the ’in vivo’ simulation in the model cell and for the ’in vitro’ simulation . r 1 = k 1 is held constant in the simulation while the bimolecular reaction rate r 2 will be affected by the crowded intracel - lular conditions of the model cell . Figure 5 . 6 shows how the number of S molecules N S is changing accordingly . The rate for the second reaction becomes r invivo 2 = k 2 , eff c E c S = k 2 × f eff c E c S ( 5 . 7 ) The steady state shifts accordingly to c ( eq ) S , invivo = k 1 k 2 f eff c E = c ( eq ) S , invitro f eff ( 5 . 8 ) 67 5 . MODELING THE IN VIVO CONDITIONS IN SILICO In order to understand the corresponding change in the reaction rate the overall effect ( f eff ) is broken down into the following three factors : 1 . The ﬁrst factor arises from the reduced free volume fraction φ that in turn leads to an increased effective concentration of the reactants c eff = c 0 × V 0 / V eff = c 0 / φ . This factor has to be added only once ( for c E ) in the mass action reaction framework dc S / dt = k 2 c E c S because c S appears both on the right and the left side of the equation . Instead of using effective concentrations , the respective factor can also be applied to the reaction rate constant , which leads to an apparent reaction rate of k volume 2 , eff = k 2 / φ . Accordingly the in vitro reaction rate has to be multiplied with a factor f volume = 1 / φ ( 5 . 9 ) 2 . The reduced effective diffusion has an inﬂuence on the reaction rate because it reduces the collision rate . For the present analysis it is assumed that the molecules react in the same way in vivo and in vitro , i . e . the microscopic reaction rate constant ( which describes the reaction probability upon a collision ) stays the same ( cf . Section 2 . 5 and 4 . 3 . 1 ) . 1 k macro = 1 k D + 1 k micro ( 5 . 10 ) Equation ( 5 . 10 ) shows how the macroscopic reaction rate depends on k D and k micro . Appendix D . 2 . 1 shows how the effect of the reduced diffusion on the reaction rate can be calculated using β : = k 2 / k D , leading to f diff = 1 1 + β (cid:16) D 0 E + D 0 S D effE + D effS − 1 (cid:17) ( 5 . 11 ) 3 . The hindered accessibility of the molecules due to sterical effects of nearby obstacles contributes a further reduction f access of the reaction rate ( see Figure 5 . 7 for an expla - nation ) . Using a Monte - Carlo sampling method of the respective volume fraction this factor was estimated to f access = 0 . 966 ± 0 . 001 in the given virtual cell . In combination the effective macroscopic bimolecular reaction rate is accordingly : k 2 , eff = k 2 × f eff = k 2 × (cid:0) f volume × f diff × f access (cid:1) ( 5 . 12 ) Table 5 . 1 a contains the resulting steady state molecule numbers N sim . invivo of three simulations with β : = k 2 / k D = 0 . 01 , β = 0 . 1 and β = 0 . 3 as well as the model prediction for the virtual cell based on Equation ( 5 . 8 ) and the steady state molecule numbers of the ’in vitro’ 68 5 . 3 .

The free volume fraction for the test spheres with a radius of 2 . 5 nm is φ = 0 . 695 in the model cell used for the simulations , leading to f volume = 1 . 44 . Note : The effective diffusion differs due to the artiﬁcial stopping probability as explained in Section 4 . 2 . 3 , Equation ( A . 13 ) . ( b ) Results from a model cell without molecular crowding whose size is adjusted in order to yield the same reduced volume and the diffusion is artiﬁcially and homogeneously reduced accordingly . Since no obstacles are present , f access = 1 . simulation N pred . S , invivo = N S , invitro / f eff . While the model prediction and the simulation results are in a perfect agreement in the case without diffusion limitation ( β = 0 . 01 ) , the values for β ≥ 0 . 1 show a signiﬁcant and increasing deviation . The number of molecules in the in vivo simulation is too small – which means that the reaction rate r 2 is too fast . For comparison also a simulation in a homogenized cell was conducted . This cell does not contain any hindering obstacles but the size is reduced by a factor of 0 . 695 so that the effective concentration of molecules matches the effective concentration in the detailed virtual cell . Also the diffusion is reset in order to match the respective effective diffusion – but only after the microscopic reaction rate was set based on the in vitro diffusion coefﬁcient . The model prediction and the latter simulation show a good agreement ( see Table 5 . 1 b ) . This leads to the conclusion , that the local properties in the detailed and crowded virtual cell differ from Figure 5 . 7 : The restricted volume close to all structures in the cell reduces the interaction volume ( green ) for the reactions . In order to estimate the effect of the reduced interaction volume on the reaction rate , the fraction of the accessible reaction vol - ume has to be averaged over all possible molecule positions in the given cell . In the complex environment of the given ran - dom intracellular architecture the calculation of the correspond - ing f access - factor is only possible with a Monte - Carlo sampling method of the respective ( green ) volume fraction . 69 5 . MODELING THE IN VIVO CONDITIONS IN SILICO Figure 5 . 8 : S and E are both subject to transient binding . This splits them into the free subspecies S 1 and E 1 and the bound subspecies S 2 and E 2 . The rates r 3 and r 4 describe the reversible binding pro - cess . Since the number of E molecules is not changed in the reaction , the bound and free subspecies can be lumped together into the average E (cid:48) . the average properties , and that the reaction rate depends on the local effective diffusion . In turn , the reaction rate could also be used to probe the local effective diffusion . In order to understand this result , it is necessary to recall the transient anomalous diffusion in the crowded environment ( cf . Section 5 . 2 ) . At short distances , the molecules still move with their original ( fast ) diffusion coefﬁcient . Only on longer distances the tortuous way around the obstacles leads to a reduced mobility . The results indicate , that the diffusion limited bimolecular reaction senses an intermediary effective diffusion coefﬁcient which is slower than D 0 but faster than the long term D eff This argument is supported by the stronger deviation of the result of the more diffusion limited reaction k 2 / k D = 0 . 3 . Obviously , the diffusion coefﬁcient of the molecules in the virtual cell observed by the reaction is not reduced as strongly as the one observed in the diffusion assay which focused on longer distances . Since a steady state approach is used , the reaction rate eventually remains constant . Though , in a setup in which the reaction consumes the molecules , the concentration is constantly reduced . This leads to longer distances between collisions of reactants and therefore a time dependent reaction rate might be observed [ 269 ] . 5 . 3 . 3 Transient Binding and Reactions The aim of this section is to analyze the effect transiently bound molecules on the reaction rate . It should have a pronounced effect on bimolecular reactions because the mobility of the bound state is zero . Immobile objects cannot move and will not collide with other immobile objects . Accordingly , they cannot react . In principle , the reduced diffusion can be included in a differential equation model based on f diff ( Equation 5 . 11 ) . This section will test this hypothesis and compare the result of the corresonding ODE models with the results of the particle tracking simulation . Both species S and E are now subject to transient binding . This means that they can reversibly bind to e . g . the cytoskeleton and stop moving for the time that they are bound . The reaction 70 5 . 3 . Effective Reaction Rates in a Cell framework changes as shown in Figure 5 . 8 . Now 4 species instead of 2 have to be tracked in the model : the unbound S 1 and E 1 with D S , 1 = D E , 1 = D 0 and and the bound S 2 and E 2 molecules with D S , 2 = D E , 2 = 0 . This leads to a combinatorial explosion of interactions , the rate r 2 splits into 2 × 2 = 4 reactions . The balance equations for the steady state of the detailed , separated model ( i ) in which all substates are balanced separately becomes quite complicated : dc s 1 dt = r 1 , 1 − r 2 (cid:48) 1 , 1 − r 2 (cid:48) 1 , 2 − r 3 , 1 + r 3 , 2 = 0 and dc s 2 dt = r 1 , 2 − r 2 (cid:48) 2 , 1 − r 2 (cid:48) 2 , 2 + r 3 , 1 − r 3 , 2 = 0 ( 5 . 13 ) In order to simplify the model , the free E 1 and bound E 2 molecules can be lumped into one average E (cid:48) molecule because their numbers do not change in the reaction ( once the steady state fraction of unbound molecules has evolved ) . The effective diffusion coefﬁcient of the E (cid:48) molecules should be D E (cid:48) = 1 / 2 × D 0 because in the given model , the fraction of unbound molecules is 1 / 2 ( cf . Section 5 . 2 . 2 , Equation 5 . 3 ) . Due to the reduced number of species , the balance equations for S simpliﬁes to dc s 1 dt = r 1 , 1 − r (cid:48) 2 (cid:48) 1 − r 3 , 1 + r 3 , 2 = 0 and dc s 2 dt = r 1 , 2 − r (cid:48) 2 (cid:48) 2 + r 3 , 1 − r 3 , 2 = 0 ( 5 . 14 ) in this lumped model ( ii ) . Both models differ signiﬁcantly . The separated model ( i ) contains 4 reactions between S and E , but the reaction r 2 (cid:48) 2 , 2 = 0 because it describes the reaction between two immobile molecules . Immobile molecules cannot collide and therefore not react ( f diff = 0 if D E = D S = 0 ) . Accordingly at least 1 / 4 of the original reaction rate is missing . In contrast , in the lumped model ( ii ) all f diff values will be grater than 0 because D E (cid:48) > 0 . Accordingly , the reaction consuming the S molecules should be faster and their steady state number lesser in the lumped model ( ii ) . The steady state solution of both Equations is given in Appendix D . 2 – Equation ( D . 24 ) - ( D . 26 ) . Figure 5 . 9 compares the steady state solution of the ODEs with the results of the particle tracking simulation . The simulation is conducted with the same parameters as in the previous section . In addition : • the binding and unbinding reactions are modeled as ﬁrst order reactions , instead of changing to a different species the molecules just change from the mobile to the immo - bile state and vice versa . • the microscopic reaction rate constant for all reactions is still held constant ( indepen - dent of the substate of the molecule ) so that only the mobility of the molecules changes the reaction rate . • no cytoskeleton and crowding elements are present in the cell in order to simplify the analysis ( i . e . f volume = f access = 1 ) . 71 5 . MODELING THE IN VIVO CONDITIONS IN SILICO Figure 5 . 9 ( a ) shows , that the simulation results correspond to the separated model ( i ) . It is worth noting that the exchange rate r 4 , 1 / 2 is not part of the equations describing S 1 and S 2 since E 1 and E 2 remain constant . So the rate constant k 4 is not observable in both ODE models . In the simulation however , k 4 can be adjusted and the reactions in the simulation sense the effect of the changed k 4 . k 4 is increased in Figure 5 . 9 from the left to the right leading to a shift of the data points from the separate model ( i ) towards the lumped model ( ii ) . Obviously the S molecules do ’sense’ the free E 1 and bound E 2 molecules as separate if the conversion between both states is slow . They will mix more if the conversion becomes faster . The simulation result is inbetween the results of the two ODE models . A mixed model ( iii ) which merges both models ( i ) and ( ii ) with a mixing parameter µ : c mixedS ( µ ) = µ × c lumpedS + ( 1 − µ ) × c sepS ( 5 . 15 ) is however able to describe the simulation results . The particle based simulation revealed how the transition between the bound and free state leads to a coupling or mixing between the states . A faster transition between the states makes the states less separated . Figure 5 . 9 shows , that • the difference between the level of unbound S 1 and bound S 2 molecules vanishes for high k 3 values • the simulation result moves from model ( i ) with separate E 1 and E 2 states towards model ( ii ) with the lumped E (cid:48) molecules if the k 4 value is increased 6 This means , that the actual rates of the binding and unbinding process are important in a reaction network . It is not sufﬁcient to simply look at the ( static ) steady state fraction of unbound molecules . Impact of Transient Binding Unspeciﬁc transient binding to macromolecules can have a tremendous effect for instance in the drug metabolism : the low fraction of unbound statins [ 225 ] reduces both , the impact on their target enzyme ( HMG - CoA - reductase in order to regulate cholesterol synthesis ) as well as their degradation rate in the liver by enzymes of the CYP family [ 41 ] . The fact that the bound fraction might be completely inaccessible for degradation leads to an even more pronounced reduction of the fraction of unbound molecules compared to the presented results . Since the exact concentration of the active form of the drug is critical in order to reduce side effects , these results support the necessity of detailed pharmacokinetic models [ 41 , 226 ] . The controlled immobilization can also lead to a speciﬁc localization of the molecules in 6 Figure D . 3 also indicates that a slower and less diffusion limited reaction rate ’senses’ this effect even stronger . 72 5 . 3 . Effective Reaction Rates in a Cell Figure 5 . 9 : S and E are both subject to transient binding . The lines show the model results for the ODE models of the separate and lumped view ( Equation ( D . 24 ) and ( D . 26 ) ) and the symbols the outcome of the detailed microscopic simulations . The mixing between both models is in ( a ) µ = 0 , in ( b ) µ = 0 . 26 , and in ( c ) µ = 0 . 70 . the cell . The localization of the molecules can favour their task for instance in metabolic channels [ 201 , 222 , 231 , 284 ] or signaling scaffolds [ 33 , 37 , 151 , 197 ] ( cf . Figure 5 . 11 ) . It can be assumed , that the advantages of the co - localization of these molecules overcompensate the disadvantages which arise out of the reduced reaction rate due to the reduced mobility . Especially in signal transduction , for instance nuclear factor NF - κ B - regulation , the level of the bound an unbound inhibitor I κ B inﬂuences the strength of the signal . Both components of this complex can bind to cytoskeleton structures [ 12 ] . The in vivo properties of the NF - κ B - I κ B complex formation are obtained in the in silico model only with the correct ratio between bound and free I κ B molecules of 2 : 1 [ 240 ] . 5 . 3 . 4 Reactions at Membranes Finally , the attention should also be directed to the plasma membrane . Some molecules can ( transiently ) bind to the plasma membrane . Others , especially signaling molecules , interact with membrane bound proteins , for instance receptors or scaffold , by which they are activated . And coat molecules which are required for the formation of vesicles bind to the respective membranes of the donor compartment or the plasma membrane in case of endocytosis [ 84 ] . Such cytoplasmic molecules have to move to the surface ﬁrst . A slow diffusion therefore reduces the overall reaction rate . Neglecting space , the ODE describing the adsorption ( activation ) process is : dc free / dt = − k adsorption c free ( 5 . 16 ) with the binding rate constant k adsorption . The same equation could also be assumed for the activation of inactive molecules . Here it is assumed , that the number of binding sites is 73 5 . MODELING THE IN VIVO CONDITIONS IN SILICO Figure 5 . 10 : Adsorption to the plasma mem - brane . The result of the ODE model of Equa - tion ( 5 . 17 ) is shown in red . The other curves are the result of the particle - tracking simula - tion in 3D , showing a remarkably slower ad - sorption , depending on the diffusion coefﬁ - cient . much larger than the number of molecules which bind to it , so that the reaction is zero order with respect to the binding sites and ﬁrst order for the free molecules that bind to them . As explained in Section 4 . 4 . 1 , the adsorption rate constant can be decomposed into a binding rate constant k PM and the ’concentration’ of the plasma membrane c PM = 4 πR 2 / ( 4 πR 3 / 3 ) = 3 / R ( number of membrane units per volume units ) which leads to the balance equation dc free / dt = − k PM c PM c free ( 5 . 17 ) This approach either corresponds to a homogeneously distributed surface in the complete reaction volume or a diffusion coefﬁcient D → ∞ . Figure 5 . 10 shows the outcome of an adsorption process to the plasma membrane in a small cell ( radius R = 1 . 25 µ m ) . The corre - sponding plasma membrane concentration is c PM = 2 . 4 µ m − 1 ( the model cell did not include a nucleus reducing the cytoplasmic volume ) . The membrane binding constant was set to k PM = 5 µ m / s . The process was simulated with the agent - based simulation method of Chap - ter 4 for different diffusion coefﬁcients . For comparison also the solution of Equation ( 5 . 17 ) is shown – the ODE - model leads to a ﬁrst order reaction with k adsorption = k PM × c PM = 12 s − 1 . The spatial simulation shows a remarkably slower adsorption , depending on the diffusion co - efﬁcient . Only at a diffusion coefﬁcient of D = 100 µ m 2 / s the spatially segregated simulation reaches the reaction rate of the ordinary differential equation ( ODE ) model , which neglects the spatial aspects . Obviously this result would be even more pronounced in a larger cell . Membrane bound proteins itself are conﬁned to a 2D region . Reactions between two mem - brane bound proteins are therefore controlled by the properties of 2D diffusion [ 300 ] . If the spatial properties are not explicitly included in the model but only a homogeneous ODE ap - proach is being used , the time dependent collision properties in two dimensions will lead to an apparent time dependent reaction rate which could be described for instance by fractal kinetics [ 11 , 19 , 22 , 107 , 118 , 269 , 300 ] . 74 5 . 4 . Discussion 5 . 4 Discussion For a full understanding of cell function , it is necessary to change every parameter of the system separately ceteris paribus – all other parameters being unchanged . The present sim - ulation provides a tool in which every interaction can be switched on or off individually , i . e . both the presence and the activity of the molecules can be controlled just by assigning the respective parameter value ( in contrast to the limitations of experimental procedures ) . Nev - ertheless experiments are needed to calibrate and justify the models and simulation methods . The particle numbers from the simulation have to be transfered into experimentally observ - able variables and into a form that can be compared to experimental data . With respect to the spatial simulation framework for instance the particle distribution can be compared to ( ﬂuo - rescence ) microscope images . M . Falk [ 77 , 78 ] has developed a visualization tool in the joint CSB project , which works like a ’virtual microscope’ for the simulation data ( cf . Figure 6 . 1 and 6 . 3 ) . With the present simulation different in vivo effects can be accessed and explored separately ﬁrst and then together in their combined action , where the total number of molecules is an ex - perimentally observable variable that can be used for model discrimination and veriﬁcation . Thus reﬁned kinetics can be determined and especially the differences between in vivo and in vitro kinetics can be explained . This chapter also showed the combinatorial explosion of interactions that occur if substates of the molecules ( bound , free , phosphorylated at site X , etc . ) are taken into account . Agent - and rule - based modeling methods can help to reduce the complexity of the system [ 108 , 297 ] . So far , the computational effort of particle based simulations does not allow the handling of large - scale models on the full cell level . Still , the present simulation is an invaluable tool to evaluate the proper reaction rates for more coarse - grained simulations : • The effective diffusion in the cell can be described by the factor D eff / D 0 and eval - uated with the present simulation for the desired cytoskeleton structure . The factor depends on the molecule size and the structure of the cellular matrix . It is worth noting , that the displacement of the molecules shows a nonlinear , anomalous behavior at short time / length - scales . • Effective reaction rates in the cell can be determined by three factors ( f eff = f volume × f diff × f access ) . These factors differentiate the reaction in the crowded in vivo envi - ronment from diluted in vitro conditions . Reactions are also sensitive to anomalous ( time - dependent ) diffusion , which could lead to fractal kinetics [ 22 ] . The latter holds especially for reactions in 2D [ 11 , 107 , 118 ] . Future work on the detailed in vivo kinetics should combine spatial aspects like the lo - cation and the mobility of the molecules with the actual reactivity of the current state of the 75 5 . MODELING THE IN VIVO CONDITIONS IN SILICO Figure 5 . 11 : ( a ) Metabolic channeling in contrast to unconnected metabolic reactions with unbound enzymes [ 1 ] . ( b ) Signal transduction through a localized scaffold versus unbound signaling com - ponents that can also activate other pathways ( crosstalk , here Kss1 in addition to Fus3 in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) [ 154 ] . molecule based on a multi - scale approach . This corresponds for example to : • the enzymes of the glycolytic pathway , which are known to interact with actin ﬁlaments [ 101 , 191 , 231 ] . The conformation and thus the activity of the enzyme is allosterically affected by the interaction with actin , and the binding strength can be regulated by the cell [ 1 ] . These ﬁndings led to the concept of metabolic channeling [ 326 ] , in which the sequence of enzymes is co - localized along the cytoskeleton in order to directly process the metabolites in an ’assembly line’ ( see Figure 5 . 11 a ) . The present simulation could be used to elucidate this effect . • scaffolds in signaling pathways . A scaffolding protein ( KSR1 in EGF - pathway [ 197 ] , Ste5 in yeast , cf . Figure 5 . 11 b [ 157 ] ) can recruit all of the molecules of the cascade into one place . Several studies have revealed an enhanced signaling output due to the scaffold in the pathway [ 33 , 37 , 148 , 151 , 197 ] . The linked setup can also control possible crosstalk mechanisms [ 272 ] – it shields the signaling molecules against other interactions [ 33 , 158 ] . Within the focus of this work on the spatial aspects in signaling , it is worth noting , that scaffolds can lead to a spatial organization of the signal in the cell . Thus a realistic , detailed simulation environment can be constructed which includes all rele - vant in vivo aspects [ 90 , 271 , 281 , 289 ] . 76 Chapter 6 Signal Transduction in Space and Time The following sections will analyze 1 . the inﬂuence of the transport of the signaling molecules , namely the difference between ( 1 ) undirected diffusion and ( 2 ) directed transport by motor proteins , 2 . the location of the nucleus in the cell , 3 . and the inﬂuence of molecular crowding in the cell within a simpliﬁed MAPK signal transduction module . In addition , the challenges in model - ing and visualization of the process will be discussed . As outlined in Chapter 2 , the MAPK cascade transfers for instance growth signals from the plasma membrane to the nucleus . The signaling molecules are activated by active receptor complexes in the plasma membrane , diffuse towards the nucleus into the cell , and can be deactivated by phosphatases in the cytoplasm . Figure 6 . 1 : ( a ) Position of active signaling molecules ( green dots ) in the simulated virtual cell . The lo - cal density of the molecules is shown by a color map ( red : high , blue : low ) . While individual molecules are difﬁcult to see , the spatial gradient is clearly visible from the color proﬁle [ 78 ] . ( b ) Average steady state concentration proﬁle of the active signaling molecules in the cell . 77 6 . SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION IN SPACE AND TIME 6 . 1 Analysis of Spatiotemporal Aspects in MAPK Signaling The description of the reaction - diffusion process based on partial differential equations ( cf . Section 3 . 1 , Equation 3 . 2 ) leads to a spatial proﬁle of active signaling molecules , which ex - hibits a gradient from the plasma membrane towards the nucleus ( or example in Figure 6 . 1 ) . The gradient is determined by the Damk¨ohler number Da : Da = k dephosphorylation × R 2 cell D ( 6 . 1 ) which relates the reaction rate constant of the deactivation reaction with the diffusion co - efﬁcient and the size of the cell [ 167 , 168 ] . A higher Damk¨ohler number means a steeper gradient . 6 . 1 . 1 Setup of the Test Model The MAPK signaling module is setup as follows ( with a Damk ¨ ohler number Da = 10 ) : • Cell diameter : 5 µ m , diameter of the nucleus : 1 . 25 µ m . • Number of cytoskeleton ﬁlaments : 3300 ( with a length of 1 µ m ) . This leads to a cy - toskeleton volume fraction of 3 . 24 % . • Number of receptors and external stimulus : ( for instance the EGF receptor complex including the upstream part of the MAPK cascade ) at the plasma membrane : 10000 ( radius = 6 nm , immobile D = 0 µ m 2 / s ) . All receptors are initially inactive . They are activated with a rate of 0 . 025 1 / s to model the external stimulus . • Number of signaling molecules ( for instance the MAPK ERK ) : 20000 ( radius = 4 nm ) , Diffusion coefﬁcient : D = 0 . 125 µ m 2 / s . All ERK molecules are initially deactivated and uniformly distributed in the cell . • Signal transduction reaction : active receptor + signaling molecule (cid:42) active receptor + active signaling molecule . Rate constant : k activation = 2 × 10 6 L / ( mol · s ) 1 . • The deactivation of active signaling molecules ( by phosphatases ) is modeled by a ﬁrst order reaction . Rate constant in the cytoplasm : 0 . 2 1 / s ; rate constant in the nucleus : 0 . 05 1 / s . • Nuclear import rate constant : 0 . 16 µ m / s , export rate constant : 0 . 018 1 / s for inactive signaling molecules , 0 . 013 1 / s for active signaling molecules [ 89 ] . This model is simulated with the particle - tracking simulation method which was described in Chapter 4 ( ∆ t = 0 . 56 ms , runtime for the 300 s of the simulations ≈ 3 hours ) . 1 Note : the activation close to the plasma membrane required to reset the reaction rate constant to 2 . 85 × 10 6 L / ( mol · s in order to account for the missing interaction volume ( cf . Section 4 . 3 . 2 ) . The diffusion limit of the reaction was k D = 1 . 02 × 10 7 L / ( mol · s ) . 78 6 . 1 . Analysis of Spatiotemporal Aspects in MAPK Signaling 6 . 1 . 2 Undirected Transport by Diffusion Figure 6 . 1 shows the distribution of the active / phosphorylated ( ERKp ) signaling molecules in the cell , which move only by diffusion . Since single molecules are difﬁcult to identify , the local density of these molecules was calculated and shown in Figure 6 . 1 ( a ) . This visualization allows the comparison with ﬂuorescence microscopy images for model veriﬁcation . Due to the high Damk¨ohler number Da = 10 , a steep gradient is found in the concentration proﬁle of the active ( ERKp ) signaling molecules ( see Figure 6 . 1 b ) . Figure 6 . 2 shows the number of ERKp molecules in the nucleus . Since the receptors are eventually all activated and remain active , a steady state will evolve . About half of the 20000 ERK molecules are activated ( data not shown ) , and on average only 379 2 ERKp molecules reach the nucleus due to the strong deactivation and slow diffusion ( ie . the high Damk¨ohler number ) . Inﬂuence of the Position of the Nucleus . For comparison , the nucleus was shifted out of the center of the cell 40 % towards the plasma membrane ( where 0 % means a central location and 100 % means adjacent to the plasma membrane ) . Thus the nucleus is closer to the plasma membrane at one side of the cell , and indeed the number of ERKp molecules in the nucleus increases to 412 on average . This is an increase of the signal strength in the nucleus of 9 % . However , due to the low number of molecules the stochastic ﬂuctuations of the molecule number is in the same range . 6 . 1 . 3 Directed Transport with Motor Proteins Some signaling molecules can be transported by motor proteins along the cytoskeleton [ 268 ] . Kholodenko [ 143 ] has suggested , that this principle is also employed in the MAPK - cascade , especially in cases where the high Damk ¨ ohler number would prevent that any active signaling molecules reach the nucleus . The present simulation method allows testing this hypothesis in a simple way : the activated signaling molecules can bind to the cytoskeleton and follow it with a constant speed of 1 µ m / s towards the center of the cell 3 [ 77 , 78 ] . The binding process is modeled in the following way : • binding rate constant to the cytoskeleton : 2 . 5 µ m 2 / s ( the units refer to the cytoskeleton concentration , which is given in length ( of the cytoskeleton ﬁlaments ) per volume . ) • dissociation rate constant from the cytoskeleton 0 . 5 1 / s . Indeed this transport mode can increase the signal strength at the nucleus ( see Figure 6 . 2 ) . The transport with motor proteins leads to a multitude of interesting and nontrivial effects , which will be discussed in the following . 2 Average of the steady state number in the time interval [ 100 , 300 ] s . 3 This of course is a simpliﬁed model of motorized transport as explained in the description of the method in Section 4 . 2 . Also the motor proteins itself are only implicitly included in the model : their action – the vectorial transport – is present , while the motors themselves are not . 79 6 . SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION IN SPACE AND TIME Figure 6 . 2 : Comparison of different transport modes and the inﬂuence of the nuclear position . 6 . 1 . 4 Discussion and Comparison Obviously the directed transport with motor proteins along the cytoskeleton will lead to a shifted distribution of signaling molecules in the cell . If the model cytoskeleton is linearly polarized e . g . from right to left , the signaling molecules will accumulate on the left . In a more realistic context it can be assumed that the radial microtubule orientation transports the signal from the plasma membrane towards the centrosome , which is close to the nucleus [ 3 ] ( cf . Figure 6 . 3 a ) . Due to the nonsymmetric cytoskeleton architecture also the distribution of the active signaling molecules becomes nonsymmetric ( see Figure 6 . 3 b ) . In order to understand the increased signal strength at the nucleus the following fact should be considered : The activation layer at the plasma membrane has a much bigger volume than the target layer around the nucleus ( the volume of the layer rises with r 2 ) , the signal does not simply accumulate but piles up enormously as indicated in Figure 6 . 3 ( c ) . The motorized Figure 6 . 3 : ( a ) Cytoskeleton structure in the simulation . ( b ) Density of the active signaling molecules , which are transported with motor proteins along the cytoskeleton ( this image was created from the molecule positions at t = 45 s ) . ( c ) The sketch explains the increased concentration due to the reduced volume of the layer around the nucleus compared to the layer at the plasma membrane . 80 6 . 1 . Analysis of Spatiotemporal Aspects in MAPK Signaling transport thus does not only lead to a directed motion towards the target in the cell but more - over focuses the signal on the nucleus . This feature can overcompensate the attenuation by phosphatases in the signaling pathway . Therefore the signal in the nucleus is higher compared to the case without motorized transport . Due to the accumulation in the center of the cell , the concentration of signaling molecules at the plasma membrane is reduced . This holds for both , the active and the inactive form . The reduced number of inactive molecules at the plasma membrane leads to a reduced activation rate once the nonuniform molecular distribution has established . This effect is the reason for the peak in the signal at the nucleus in Figure 6 . 2 4 . The transport time from the plasma membrane to the nucleus is determined by the transport mode : molecules that are transported with a constant velocity v motor into the desired direction have the travel time t = L / v motor . In contrast , diffusing molecules exhibit a wide distribution of travel times . A few molecules happen to move always more or less into the ’right’ direction and thus arrive extremely fast at the target [ 167 , 168 ] . But the majority of the random walkers arrives later than the molecules which are transported by motor proteins due to their long and detourous way through the cell ( compare the different activation proﬁles in Figure 6 . 2 : steep for the motorized signals , smooth for the diffusing ones ) . Thus , nature provides two distinct methods of signal transmission : the fast but also uncertain diffusion and the directed but in - ﬂexible transport with motor proteins . Of course the signaling molecules that can employ motor proteins need to ﬁnd the cytoskeleton tracks ﬁrst in a diffusive search process as well . Depending on the lifetime of the motor - bound state , the dynamic binding and unbinding to the cytoskeleton tracks , and the resulting fraction of unbound signaling molecules , also the motorized molecules exhibit at least partly the properties of the diffusing molecules . Thus the advantages of both transport methods can be coupled by adjusting the fraction of motorized proteins for example depending on the cell size and the expected / demanded signal dynamics . In addition , traveling waves or signaling endosomes could play an important role in the signal transduction as well , especially in larger cells and moreover elongated cell protrusions like axons [ 128 , 189 ] . Transport - Controlled Reaction Rates The directed path of molecules transported by motor proteins covers much less space than the meandering path of diffusing ones ( see Figure 6 . 4 ) . In principle the slow motion along the cytoskeleton can be neglected if compared to the gross displacement of diffusion ( not the net displacement which grows much slower due to steps into the opposite direction canceling each other ) . Therefore , the probability to hit a reaction partner is reduced [ 77 , 317 ] . Accordingly , 4 Likewise the nucleo - cytoplasmic shuttling rates can lead to an accumulation of signaling molecules in the nucleus ( cf . pERK in Section 7 ) . This spatial redistribution of molecules could subsequently lead to a temporal modulation of the signal , depending on the actual parameters of the shuttling , transport , and reaction rates [ 121 ] . 81 6 . SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION IN SPACE AND TIME Figure 6 . 4 : ( a ) The collision probability ( in a certain time ∆ t ) depends on the length of the path L and the cross section σ . ( b , c ) Comparison of the paths of ( b ) diffusing molecules and ( c ) molecules which are transported by motor proteins through the cell ( the paths are shown in red ) . Both images show the same time span , clearly the diffusing molecules in ( b ) cover more space than the directly transported molecules ( straight lines ) in ( c ) . Adapted from Falk et al . [ 78 ] . any diffusion limited bimolecular reaction rate will be reduced as well . In the context of MAPK signaling this means that the deactivating dephosphorylation reaction by phosphatases will be reduced . Thus signal transduction employing motor proteins for transport does not only beneﬁt from a directed transport but possibly also from a reduced deactivation rate . 6 . 2 Parameters of Signal Transduction Models The parameters of the model determine the outcome of the signal transduction module . For instance , the reaction and transport rate constants of the Damk ¨ ohler number determine the steepness of the gradient . In more complex models , the parameters can also lead to effects like oscillations , ultrasensitivity , bistability , and switches [ 52 , 73 ] . For example Markevich et al . [ 189 ] constructed a long range signaling module based on feedback loops in the MAPK - cascade . Other models also can distinguish different activation patterns and lead either to a Figure 6 . 5 : Dependency of the Damk¨ohler num - bers Da eff , 1 and Da eff , 2 ( Equation ( 6 . 2 ) and ( 6 . 3 ) ) on the effective diffusion . Parameters : R cell = 5 µ m , D 0 = 1 µ m 2 , molecular radii for MAPK and the phosphatase r molecule = 2 . 5 nm , which leads to the diffusion limit of k D = 7 . 567645 × 10 7 l / ( mol · s ) ) . k dephosphorylation = 0 . 1 , 1 and 3 1 / s . Note that k dephosphorylation = k × c phos ⇒ k = k dephosphorylation / c phos . Phosphatase concentration c phos = 1 . 3 × 10 − 7 mol / l . It is assumed that both reactants have the same effective diffusion . 82 6 . 3 . Spatial & Stochastic Modeling in Signal Transduction transient or a sustained activation of the signal output [ 34 , 146 , 197 ] . In a model based on differential equations , the parameters should be the effective in vivo reaction rate constants and already contain for instance molecular crowding effects . In ODE - models which neglect the spatial aspects , these effective parameters also have to somehow ( implicitly ) include the delay due to necessary transport steps . It would be wrong to use these parameters in a more detailed model which as such includes the spatial aspects and molecular crowding explicitly . As explained in the previous chapter , these factors change the reaction rates and thus will lead to a different result . Using the average parameters also in a more detailed virtual cell therefore means to include the reduced diffusion and molecular crowding effects twice . Accordingly , ’in vitro’ rate constants are needed , which transform into the cor - rect in vivo rates due to the ’in vivo’ conditions in the simulation . The sensitivity of signal transduction models to the structure of the model cell can be il - lustrated in the following example : The Damk¨ohler number couples the diffusion and the reaction rate , which can both change due to the intracellular conditions . A reduced effective diffusion D eff < D 0 will lead to an incrased effective Damk ¨ ohler number Da eff , 1 = k dephosphorylation × R 2 cell D eff ( 6 . 2 ) because D is in the denominator . If also the reaction rate of a diffusion limited reaction is taken into account ( Equation 5 . 11 ) , the effective Damk ¨ ohler number becomes : Da eff , 2 = (cid:0) k dephosphorylation × f diff (cid:1) × R 2 cell D eff ( 6 . 3 ) Figure 6 . 5 shows the resulting Damk ¨ ohler numbers and that the reduced reaction rate can partly compensate the effect of the reduced diffusion , especially for the strongly diffusion limited reaction with ( k / k D = 0 . 3 ) . Since the Damk ¨ ohler number determines the steepness of the gradient in the concentration proﬁle of active signaling molecules , the intracellular con - ditions can have a tremendous effect on the result of the signal transduction model . Together with the uncertainties of experimental data this example outlines the challenges that have to be succeeded in order to model signal transduction correctly in a detailed model cell . 6 . 3 Spatial & Stochastic Modeling in Signal Transduction This work showed how the proposed transport with motor proteins affects signal transduction not only by a directed and targeted motion but much more by an altered distribution of the molecules . Here the simulation has an advantage on continuous approaches because every cytoskeleton track is modeled in detail . The spatial aspects of the cell are included , especially 83 6 . SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION IN SPACE AND TIME the distance between the plasma membrane and the nucleus . But no law in nature restricts the nucleus to be in the center of the cell . Simply by shifting the nucleus closer to the surface ( and thus breaking the spherical symmetry which in turn renders the solution of PDE models much more complex ) the signal strength is – on average – increased by 9 % . Thus the simulation can be used to test how models that did not include the spatial aspect of signal transduction will behave in 3D . The advantage of the spatial and event based stochastic simulation framework arises from the ability to elucidate the biophysical fundamentals governing signal transduction . This starts at the detailed description of reactions and the effective reduced diffusion in the cell covered in the previous chapter , which cannot be studied with ODE models . It extends to the visualiza - tion of the individual signaling molecules , their distribution and their detailed path through the cell ( see Figures 1 and 6 . 4 for an example ) . Finally , also the stochasticity is included in the model , which can play a critical role in signal transduction if only a few active signaling molecules are involved . Future work should also include a rigorous analysis of the modulation and stochastic ampli - ﬁcation ( cf . [ 207 ] ) introduced by the signaling cascade especially in the context of weak or ﬂuctuating external signals . In addition , the transient binding effect should be considered in signal transduction : the binding of signaling compounds like I κ B ( the inhibitor of the nuclear factor NF - κ B ) to the cytoskeleton [ 12 ] reduces the abundance of available molecules and thus inﬂuences the strength of the inhibition . The activity of the NF - κ B signaling complex , in turn , strongly depends on the fraction of unbound I κ B [ 240 ] . It is obvious , that the present computationally extensive simulation framework does not yet allow wide - ranging parameter studies . The fact that it requires several simulations in order to average out the ﬂuctuations of low particle numbers and to obtain meaningful data fur - thermore increases the computation time . Therefore the present simulation method was not applied to the study of parameter dependent transitions in the network output like oscillations or bistability . Likewise it is not yet possible to use it for the parameter estimation of signaling models based on experimental data ( which itself do mostly lack the required spatial and tem - poral resolution and a sufﬁcient accuracy ) . The challenge in obtaining the corresponding life cell data arises from the fact , that inactive MAPK and active MAPKp are the same molecule besides the phosphorylation . Therefore a labeling method is needed that can distinguish the conformations of both states in vivo . This has become possible only recently using FRET ( F¨orster or Fluorescence resonance energy transfer ) [ 5 ] . Accordingly , the post - processing of the simulation results has to create images that can be compared to the experimentally ob - servable variables in order to rate the model results . The visualization tool developed in close collaboration by Martin Falk [ 77 , 78 ] provides for instance the local particle density shown in Figure 6 . 1 , which can be compared to the ﬂuorescence intensity from microscope images and thus allows model testing and veriﬁcation based on experimental data . 84 Chapter 7 Modeling the MAPK - Cascade This section aims at elucidating the dynamic properties of ERK activation based on the model and data of Fujioka et al . [ 89 ] ( see Figure 7 . 1 ) . This model has three advantages : ( i ) the rates were determined based on experimental data , ( ii ) it explicitly includes the nucleo - cytoplasmic shuttling rates , and ( iii ) it contains a simpliﬁed yet functional module of the upstream part of the signaling pathway between the receptor and the MAPK - Cascade . Figure 7 . 1 : MAPK - signaling model including also the nucleo - cytoplasmic shuttling as presented by Fujioka et al . [ 89 ] . Reactions and parameters are given in Appendix D . 3 . 1 . 85 7 . MODELING THE MAPK - CASCADE 7 . 1 Model Description and Parameterization The model is , in principle , based on three compartments : ( i ) the upstream part of the cascade in / at the plasma membrane , ( ii ) the cytoplasm , and ( iii ) the nucleus . However , Fujioka et al . [ 89 ] did not include the spatial aspects in their model , just the compartmentalization . The model consists of the minimum number of molecules species and interactions [ 89 ] . Fu - jioka et al . [ 89 ] used the FRET 1 technique to obtain the number of active signaling molecules ( Raf , pERK ) and Western blot for ( pMEK ) . The nucleocytoplasmic shuttling rate constants were determined based on the change in the ﬂuorescence intensity of selectively photoacti - vated molecules ( either in the nucleus or the cytoplasm ) . Also phosphatase and kinase re - action rate constants were determined based on in vivo data . The parameters of the upstram part of the signaling pathway were however only arbitrarily adjusted in order to obtain the dynamics of the Ras activation [ 89 ] . The model structure is shown in Figure 7 . 1 , reactions , equations , parameters and molecule numbers are given in Appendix D . 3 . 1 . The model has been simulated using 1 . the Gillespie method ( as explained in Section 3 . 3 . 1 ) , neglecting the spatial separation between the plasma membrane and the nucleus 2 . the particle tracking simulation in which the diffusion through the cytoplasm towards the nucleus is explicitly modeled as a random walk of the signaling molecules in or - der to analyze spatial aspects . The diffusion coefﬁcient in this simulation is set to D = 1 µ m 2 / s . About a million of molecules has to be tracked in the simulation , which requires a tremendous computation time . Therefore , it is not possible to include ef - fects like molecular crowding or the cytoskeleton structure because this would lead to a further and enormous increase of the computation time . The model cell had a diameter of 12 . 9 µ m and the nucleus 7 . 36 µ m respectively . 7 . 2 Results Figure 7 . 2 shows how the activation of the stimulation ( all ’kinase’ molecules are set to the active state at t = 0 ) propagates through the signaling cascade . Subsequently the components are activated , starting with the membrane bound upstream part up to RAS and RAF within the ﬁrst minute . Secondly MEK is activated and reaches its maximum activation after around 5 minutes . Via MEK also ERK is activated with a maximum of the total activation after 6 minutes . Due to the transport into the nucleus , this peak is delayed for about 30 seconds in 1 FRET = F¨orster or Fluorescence resonance energy transfer ( between nearby molecules ) . It allows to detect complexes if the two subunits are respecively labeled or conformational changes of a molecule which is labeled with two ﬂuorescent markers that change their distance due to the change in the molecular conformation [ 5 ] . Thus the active ( phosphorylated ) form of the molecule can be discriminated in vivo from the inactive form . 86 7 . 2 . Results Figure 7 . 2 : Dynamics of the MAPK signaling cascade . Figure 7 . 3 : Activation of the MEK and ERK molecules in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus . Only the MEK - ERK complex shows a small difference between the Gillespie ( 1 ) and Particle Tracking ( 2 ) method , all other curves can not be differentiated . 87 7 . MODELING THE MAPK - CASCADE the nucleus ( see Figure 7 . 3 ) . At this stage it is worth noting that also this model shows signal ampliﬁcation . Although the MEK concentration is higher than the ERK concentration , even - tually more ERK molecules are activated . The comparison between the Gillespie ( 1 ) and the particle tracking ( 2 ) method shows no dif - ference ( as indicated in Figure 7 . 3 ) . This means that the spatial aspect can be neglected for this parameter set . The Damk¨ohler number for MEK is Da MEK ≈ 0 . 42 , which predicts only a small loss of the activation from the plasma membrane towards the nucleus . Figure 7 . 4 shows the distribution of the pMEK - molecules in space and time and the presence of a small gradient - which is actually not bigger than the stochastic noise and thus negligible . The de - tailed view reveals that there is a 5 second delay in the propagation of the pMEK signal from the plasma membrane towards the nucleus ( see Figure 7 . 5 ) . Considering the minute long peak of the signal , this delay seems to be negligible as well . In this cascade actually not only the ﬁnal stage ERK but also the intermediate MEK is a mo - bile transmitter of the signal in the cell . ERK , which is activated everywhere in the cell by pMEK , does neither exhibit a gradient nor a delay between the activation in the cytoplasm and the nucleus . Due to the fast diffusion the ﬁrst MEK molecule reaches the nucleus already within 10 sec - onds ( which is in the same range as the results reported in [ 167 ] ) . In the same time also the ﬁrst activated ERK molecule appears in the nucleus – either through activation within the nucleus or a transport process . This result can be interpreted in stating that the multistage signaling cascade might have evolved not only in order to amplify the signal but also to reduce the attenuating effects of the reaction - diffusion process . While the intermediary compound MEK showed a small spatial gradient as well as a temporal retardation of the signal , the ﬁnal stage ERK was activated without a further delay . 7 . 3 Discussion and Outlook This chapter demonstrates , that the present simulation framework is a powerful tool also for large - scale signal transduction models and allows to analyze their spatiaotemporal aspects . The negligible gradient in the pMEK concentration arises out of the given parameters in the model ( the Damk¨ohler number is much smaller than the Damk¨ohler number in the previous chapter ) . A smaller diffusion coefﬁcient would increase the gradient and the delay of the signal in the nucleus . However [ 89 ] did not measure this parameter , so the value was taken from other models [ 143 , 167 ] . In turn , the missing gradient in the pERK concentration arises from the different model structure – ERK is activated not only at the plasma membrane but everywhere in the cell , since also pMEK is a mobile component in the present model and 88 7 . 3 . Discussion and Outlook Figure 7 . 4 : Proﬁle of the activated molecules between the plasma membrane ( PM ) and the nucleus ( concentration in [ µ mol / l ] ) , and gradient along the r - axis . Figure 7 . 5 : Proﬁle of the initial phase of the activation of the MEK and ERK molecules between the plasma membrane ( PM ) and the nucleus ( concentration in [ nmol / l ] ) . pMEK shows a gradient / delay – the concentration at the plasma membrane is higher than at the nucleus at a given time . The level of pMEK at the plasma membrane is reached at the nucleus with a delay of ≈ 5 s . nearly equally distributed in the cell ( pMEK can activate ERK even in the nucleus ) . Finally , the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling leads to a signiﬁcant accumulation of pERK in the nucleus ( cf . Figure 7 . 3 ) . ’Even though this model lacks many important components and feedback loops that are known to regulate the Ras / ERK MAPK cascade , it could reproduce the essential features of the acti - vation and nuclear translocation of ERK observed using FRET - based probes’ [ 89 ] . The dif - ferences between the model results and the experimental data will most likely emanate from the reduced model structure because the present results have indicated that the neglected spa - tial aspects of the cell do not change the outcome of the model . In addition to a reﬁnement of the model , the most necessary extension would be the inclu - sion of gene regulation in the nucleus – the ﬁnal target of the signaling cascade . Considering the fact that there is mostly only one copy of the gene which can only be in the on or off state , the underlying stochasticity of the gene regulation should be taken into account [ 314 ] . In 89 7 . MODELING THE MAPK - CASCADE addition , the translation into new proteins could be included . Especially the MAPKp - induced activation of those phosphatases which dephosphorylate MAPKp ( here pERK ) closes a pow - erful feedback loop [ 135 ] 2 . The present agent based simulation can also be used to elucidate the role of the scaffolds that occur in many signal transduction pathways because each molecule and complex of the pathway is modeled individually with a deﬁned position in . On the one hand scaffolds keep the bound ( intermediary ) signaling molecules like MAPKKp ( here : MEK ) in the active state , on the other hand these constructs lead to only one active MAPKKp molecule per scaffold . In contrast , freely interacting molecules of the upstream part of the signaling cascade could activate thousands of molecules of the next stage of the cascade . Of course these multi - plicative effect is counteracted by a possibly faster deactivation of free MAPKKp molecules [ 197 ] . Therefore the exact properties of the in vivo signal transduction might depend on the parameters but also on the spatial organization of the cell . The optimal distribution be - tween localized scaffolds and ﬂexible unstructured activations by free molecules could be employed for instance to differentiate between sustained and transient activations of the sig - nal [ 33 , 146 , 148 , 151 , 190 , 197 ] . Also the regulation of the crosstalk between ( competing ) signals could be mediated by scaffolding proteins [ 83 , 154 , 229 , 237 ] 3 . 2 The time span of this feedback ( hours [ 135 ] ) is however beyond the scope of the present detailed simulation which aimed at resolving the arrival of the ﬁrst signaling molecules in the nucleus . 3 In the context of the immobilizing gel like properties of actin polymer networks [ 241 ] the scaffolds might also be necessary to reach through the peripheral actin layer [ 3 ] delivering the signal to truly mobile components in the cytosol , which then can transport it towards the nucleus . 90 Chapter 8 Vesicle Transport and the Compartmentalization of the Cell Within this chapter the agent - based simulation method is applied to a compartmented cell . The different membrane enclosed compartments are connected with dynamically formed vesi - cles , which sort and transport proteins to the desired target as shown in Figure 8 . 1 [ 66 , 234 ] . Principles , setup , and modeling of vesicle transport are explained and explored in this chapter and a functional model is established . The membrane trafﬁcking model is then applied in the next chapter to investigate how the vesicle transport interferes with signal transduction . Figure 8 . 1 : General membrane trafﬁcking network in eukaryotic cells . 91 8 . VESICLE TRANSPORT AND THE COMPARTMENTALIZATION OF THE CELL 8 . 1 The Membrane Trafﬁcking Network and Machinery The organization of metabolic reactions and protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells requires complex machinery that maintains the creation and functionality of specialized compartments and controls the speciﬁc subcellular location of the respective proteins [ 219 , 291 ] . The dif - ferent membrane enclosed compartments ( Endoplasmic Reticulum ( ER ) , Golgi stacks , Endo - somes , to just name a few ) form a dynamically linked network in which vesicles deliver cargo molecules from donor to target compartments . The complete membrane trafﬁcking network is presented in Figure 8 . 1 , based on the current knowledge [ 29 , 30 , 66 ] . The key features of vesicle transport are the accurate selection of only the desired molecules into the vesicles and the transport of the vesicle towards the correct target through the crowded intracellular environment [ 182 , 212 , 214 , 312 ] . While the sorting depends on speciﬁc ( short range ) molecular interactions between the proteins forming a vesicle [ 64 , 66 , 172 , 202 ] , the navigation through the cell requires a long range orientation ( cf . Figure 8 . 2 a - c ) [ 27 ] . It can be assumed , that the transport process employs motor proteins pulling the vesicle along cy - toskeleton tracks [ 3 , 119 , 140 , 219 , 245 ] . This allows the directed motion towards the target , given that the vesicle happens to run on the right track . Considering the large number of cytoskeleton ﬁlaments and furthermore their dynamics , ﬁnding the right way through the cell is not a trivial task [ 260 ] . The probability to hit a desired target only by diffusion is rather small as well [ 111 ] . The present work investigated the principal interactions of the transport process and the connecting cytoskeleton structures which guarantee that a vesicle is not lost in space . For a rigorous analysis , the large network can be broken into small units . Each vesicle trans - port step between two compartments forms a module ( see Figure8 . 2 a ) [ 116 , 120 , 123 ] . The vesicle transport module combines vesicle budding at the donor compartment , transport , and the fusion process at the target compartment . During their lifetimes compartments and vesi - cles can maturate and develop into another compartment [ 234 ] . This opens an alternative way of transporting and processing proteins , discussed especially for the route from the early endosome via the late endosome to the vacuole , but also for the Golgi stacks [ 66 , 234 ] . In principle , each vesicle and compartment is an autonomous entity . The initial state deter - mines the temporal development of its location , internal biochemical conversions , and matu - ration processes . Of course , the vesicle is inﬂuenced by all other molecules and regulations in the cell , but the interfaces of possible interactions , i . e . receptors for external stimuli or connections to the cytoskeleton , have to be installed during the creation of the vesicle . This especially holds for the key proteins of the vesicle - vesicle interaction and the fusion pro - cess . Vesicle fusion is initiated by a docking and tethering state induced by tethering factors [ 232 , 233 ] . Subsequently the binding of SNARE ( Soluble NSF Attachment protein REcep - tors ) proteins connects both membranes and promotes the eventual fusion via a cis - trans - 92 8 . 1 . Membrane Trafﬁcking Network and Machinery conversion ( see Figure 8 . 2 b ) . The SNARE proteins can be subdivided into the v - SNAREs in the vesicle membrane and the t - SNAREs at the target compartment [ 49 , 106 , 133 , 199 , 230 ] . The SNARE - complex can dissociate upon vesicle fusion , providing SNAREs for the next transport step . For each connection in the secretory pathway different v - SNARE – t - SNARE pairs have been identiﬁed [ 106 , 199 ] , leading to the conclusion that the SNARE - proﬁle of a vesicle deﬁnes its target . It has to be noted however , that the SNARE - interaction is not completely speciﬁc , Figure 8 . 2 : ( a ) Modularity of the vesicle transport steps . ( b ) Vesicle fusion is mediated by tethering factors and SNAREs . These molecules can only interact if the vesicle is in close vicinity of the target compartment .

VESICLE TRANSPORT AND THE COMPARTMENTALIZATION OF THE CELL Figure 8 . 3 : Vesicle model from Heinrich and Rapoport [ 120 ] and the generation of nonidentical com - partments . c (cid:13) Heinrich and Rapoport , 2005 . Originally published in JCB vol . 168 no . 2 271 – 280 . creating a rather fuzzy address [ 43 , 306 ] . SNAREs which are additionally carried only for recycling purposes furthermore blur the speciﬁc address of the vesicle [ 43 ] . Accordingly , the v - SNAREs have to be loaded into the vesicle during the budding process ( see Figure 8 . 2 c ) [ 120 ] . The vesicle itself is created by the polymerization of a coat around it , which forms its shape and selects the cargo molecules via transmembrane domains ( cf . Figure 2 . 2 on the left ) . This coat consists of a variety of proteins [ 23 ] , can be classiﬁed as COPI , COPII , or clathrin coat [ 14 , 18 , 23 , 29 , 292 ] , and shows a modular design [ 136 ] . The variety of proteins involved in the coat formation and cargo selection on the one hand and the need to simplify this complexity in order to build a full scale model on the other hand can be accounted for by deﬁning the coat as just one ( complex ) protein , which can exist in many sub - types . The two compartment model of Heinrich and Rapoport [ 120 ] thus uses the coat A and B and their different preferences for different compartments , cargo and SNAREs . ( Likewise SNAREs and tethering factors can be lumped together for simpliﬁcation ) . The ODE - model of Heinrich and Rapoport [ 120 ] was already able to generate nonidentical compartments and to facilitate the sorting of molecules ( see Figure 8 . 3 ) . However , it omits the spatial aspects of vesicle transport , tracking only the number , size , and state of the compartments ( like other current models [ 40 , 104 ] ) . Other models include the spatial aspect but use a continuous ﬂow approach to describe the vesicle ﬂux , neglecting the discrete properties of individual vesicles [ 162 ] or only cover subproblems like budding [ 86 ] or fusion [ 277 ] . The given information is not yet sufﬁcient to assure that a vesicle reaches the target compart - ment for a subsequent tethering , docking and fusion process . So far the only deﬁned force acting on the vesicles and governing the transport process is undirected diffusion . In order to transport the vesicles along the cytoskeleton directly towards the correct target , motor pro - 96 8 . 1 . Membrane Trafﬁcking Network and Machinery teins have to be included in the description [ 27 , 138 , 162 , 258 ] . Figure 8 . 2 d shows the complete network of interactions between the molecule species which are involved in membrane trafﬁcking . The total set of interactions between different sub - types of ’coats’ 1 , ’snare’ , ’cargo’ and ’motors’ can be broken into the subset of subspecies and interactions governing a given membrane trafﬁcking connection between two compart - ments . In the principle of the Heinrich and Rapoport [ 120 ] model ( see Figure 8 . 3 ) ’coat A’ binds to ’compartment 1’ , selects ’cargo 1’ and ’snare X’ into a vesicle which fuses via the strong ’snare X – Y’ interaction to ’compartment 2’ ( with the limitation that all actions are preferentially , not absolutely ) . The second module , responsible for the reverse transport , is respectively set on the strong ’compartment 2’ - ’coat B’ - ’cargo 2’ - ’snare V’ - ’snare U - V’ in - teraction . The directed transport with motor proteins requires adding the ’motor 1’ going from ’compartment 1’ towards ’compartment 2’ and the reverse ’motor 2’ accordingly . These ’motors’ could represent Kinesin and Dynein that walk along microtubules in different direc - tions [ 177 , 294 , 309 , 310 ] . The aim of the present work is to integrate and condense the present knowledge into a 4D spatio - temporal agent - based model . The virtual three - dimensional cell which is set up in order to model vesicle transport contains cytoskeleton structures , crowding agents and all necessary molecule species to drive the membrane trafﬁcking machinery . The structured and event based approach also preserves the inherent stochasticity equal to the stochastic noise and ﬂuctuations in the real number of vesicles . The limitation of agent / molecular interactions to relevant interactions of the model still keeps the simulation tractable despite the overall complexity . The introduced modularity of the vesicle transport network further improves the handling and allows an easy scale - up from a simple two compartment setup towards a model containing all compartments . The challenge in the discrete and spatially segregated model arises from the task to guide vesicles towards distant targets – based on local molecular interactions . It requires the true to original reconstruction of the microtubule connection between two compartments in order to obtain a correctly functioning vesicle transport with motor proteins along these tracks . The dynamic co - localization of membrane trafﬁcking compartments and individual cytoskeleton ﬁlaments is difﬁcult to resolve with current live cell imaging technologies [ 140 , 298 ] . It is known however , that the Golgi network is located around the centrosome [ 15 , 256 , 294 ] , that the Golgi apparatus has a certain inﬂuence on the microtubule network [ 45 ] , changes and interferes with the cell cycle [ 56 , 160 , 203 , 256 ] , and might be linked to cell fate de - cisions [ 171 ] . The ER is linked to the Golgi via microtubules [ 4 , 172 , 176 , 177 ] , and the ER - Golgi complex is the principal secretory unit [ 160 ] . Also endocytic carrier vesicles fol - 1 The author uses lower case molecule identiﬁers in order to underline the abstract modeling character . 97 8 . VESICLE TRANSPORT AND THE COMPARTMENTALIZATION OF THE CELL low microtubules [ 57 , 124 , 245 ] . In yeast however , a strong interaction between Endosomes and actin cables is found [ 91 , 129 ] . The whole endocytosis process is strongly linked to actin ﬁlaments since the corresponding clathrin coat involves actin polymerizing and anchoring proteins [ 137 , 149 , 195 , 209 ] . The linking between the compartments and the cytoskeleton could be static by ﬁxed connections or dynamic by motors that move into opposite directions in a tug of war concept [ 275 ] . Beneath this global structures , the three - dimensional vesicles and compartments show a local structure that emerges from different proteins and lipids [ 36 , 109 , 131 , 195 , 250 ] . Such struc - tures like lipid rafts deﬁne e . g . the budding site where new vesicles are created and pinched off from the donor compartment [ 80 , 113 , 292 ] . 8 . 2 Vesicle Model and Simulation Framework This section describes the implementation of vesicle transport between membrane enclosed compartments in the cell . It extends the agent - based simulation introduced in Chapter 4 by vesicle - agents .

Vesicle Model and Simulation Framework knowledge of membrane trafﬁcking . Most vesicle actions are driven by molecular interactions between the molecules of the vesicle machinery ( cf . Figure 8 . 2 , Figure 8 . 4 , and Table 8 . 1 ) . 8 . 2 . 1 Vesicle Agents Vesicle agents represent both membrane enclosed compartments and the transport vesicles which are exchanged between the compartments . They are modeled as spheres and extend the mobile molecule agents of Section 4 . 2 by the following points : • Identity : The type of the agent identiﬁes the compartment e . g . as Golgi . Furthermore its donor compartment is tracked to resolve its origin 2 . • Cargo : Vesicles / compartments can contain different molecules . These molecules can be further categorized in six groups ( three of them have already been deﬁned by [ 120 ] ) : i monomeric Coat molecules that are bound to the vesicle surface . ii Coat molecules that are in the polymerized state ( in the budding process ) . iii SNARE proteins ( which can promote vesicle fusion ) . iv motor proteins for the transport along the cytoskeleton . v membrane bound cargo molecules ( e . g . receptors ) . vi cargo molecules that are located inside of the vesicle . The number of molecules of each type / subtype in a vesicle / compartment is stored in a list which is linked to the respective vesicle agent . • Volume , Surface , Radius : All three parameters are tracked separately for the fol - lowing reason . Both , the total vesicle surface area and the total vesicle volume are conserved in all processes . Due to the different exponents of volume V = 4 πr 3 / 3 and surface A = 4 πr 2 for a sphere , both numbers are not in agreement after a fusion event 3 . Still the vesicle agents are modeled as spheres , which radius is calculated based on the volume . The surplus - surface could be arranged e . g . in a wavy , corrugated manner around the sphere . In this context it has to be mentioned that the plasma membrane itself constitutes a compart - ment , from which vesicles can be formed in the endocytosis process , and to which exocytic vesicles can fuse . Since the plasma membrane corresponds to the particle based simulation framework , all ’cargo’ molecules of the plasma membrane have to be modeled explicitly as particle agents . A special interface treats the import of these molecules into the endocytic vesicle . 2 In order to reduce the memory usage of the simulation this ( and further ) speciﬁc vesicle data are only stored for vesicle agents but not for normal proteins . The linking of the vesicle attributes extending the previous agent functionality to the individual agents is handled with an extra list . 3 A row of fusion events can lead to a high surface to volume ratio . In vivo this leads to tubular compartments , for instance the ER - Golgi intermediate compartments ( ERGIC ) [ 66 ] . 99 8 . VESICLE TRANSPORT AND THE COMPARTMENTALIZATION OF THE CELL It is worth noting that vesicle agents must not overlap . This means , that vesicle agents have to check their new positions with all other vesicle - agent positions ( in addition to the position of all static structures in the cell ) in order to avoid an restricted position 4 . 8 . 2 . 2 Vesicle Interactions While checking for restricted positions by cellular structures or other vesicles , the corre - sponding distance between the objects is calculated . Vesicles can also interact with the cel - lular structures and other vesicles , which is modeled in a distance dependent manner in the present simulation . Therefore these interactions are handled in the same query . In general , all reactions are based on mass action kinetics . Vesicle Fusion From the modeling perspective , vesicle fusion is simply a reaction between two agents . This reaction is modeled in the bimolecular reaction framework introduced in Section 4 . 3 . 1 . Since vesicles are non - overlapping the reaction framework of Section 4 . 4 . 2 has to be used . The critical interaction distance between vesicle v and vesicle w is calculated based on the fusion rate constant k fusionv , w . Vesicle fusion depends on the SNARE - interaction as shown in Figure 8 . 2 , b . Therefor the reaction rate constant k fusionv , w is determined by the SNARE interaction in the following way : • SNARE - Interaction : The SNARE interaction is determined by the preference of the model SNARE proteins to form a pair . It can be described by the symmetric ma - trix p snareij , carrying the interaction strength or preference for each possible SNARE - SNARE - combination [ 120 ] and could look for instance like : SNARE - SNARE snare 1 snare 2 snare 3 snare 4 snare 1 0 . 0 2 . 0 0 . 0 0 . 5 snare 2 2 . 0 0 . 0 0 . 5 0 . 0 snare 3 0 . 0 0 . 5 0 . 0 2 . 0 snare 4 0 . 5 0 . 0 2 . 0 0 . 0 • SNARE - Pairs : The number of SNARE - pairs between vesicle v and w is in principle calculated by multiplying the number of SNAREs of each kind 5 . with their pairing 4 This extra calculation does not slow down the algorithm dramatically because the number of vesicles is small . Also , the position is not compared to molecule - agents , because ( i ) otherwise all molecule - agents would need to avoid vesicles in return and ( ii ) the computational effort would not be marginal ( cf . Section 4 . 2 . 3 ) . 5 Heinrich and Rapoport [ 120 ] simply multiplied both SNARE concentration times the interaction strength and summed up all possible combinations in their model . In this detailed model it is however better to use the minimal number of both SNAREs because there cannot be more pairs than the smaller number of partners . The 100 8 . 2 . Vesicle Model and Simulation Framework strength p snareij : N pairs , v , w = (cid:88) ij p snareij min ( N snare , i , v , N snare , j , w ) ( 8 . 1 ) where the SNAREs i are in the ones in compartment v and the SNAREs j in w . The number of SNAREs is calculated as N snare = c snare × A based on the SNARE concen - tration ( in the membranes ) of the vesicles and the interaction area of the vesicles . • Interaction - Area : The SNARE - interaction has only a limited range , due to the ﬁnite size of the SNARE - molecules . Based on this distance d max the interaction - area of the vesicles is calculated as shown in Figure 8 . 5 . • Vesicle Fusion Rate Constant : The rate constant for vesicle fusion is then found by multiplying a general fusion rate constant per SNARE - pair k ( 0 ) per pair with the effective number of pairs for the respective pair of vesicles 6 : k fusionv , w = k ( 0 ) per pair × N pairs , v , w ( 8 . 2 ) • Fusion - Time : Vesicle fusion is not an instantaneous process but rather a slow conver - sion into a new , larger vesicle . For the simulation it is assumed that the fusion time is inversely proportional to N pairs : fusion is faster if more SNARE - pairs are included . Like the initial fusion rate constant per SNARE - pair k ( 0 ) per pair also the fusion time per SNARE - pair τ ( 0 ) per pair is speciﬁed as a parameter of the simulation . If two vesicles are closer than the reaction distance based on their SNARE - pairs , the fusion will be initiated . Subsequently the corresponding agents are noted as fusing vesicles which allows them to overlap . One vesicle will move closer towards the fusion partner until it ﬁnally is completely inside of the partner at the calculated end time of the fusion process . While the fusing vesicle moves relatively to its partner , the motion steps of the partner have to avoid collisions between obstacles and the fusing vesicle as well . Finally the vesicle information following example explains why : The approach of Heinrich and Rapoport [ 120 ] leads to the situation that the fusion probability between two vesicles with 2 and 12 SNAREs respectively is larger ( 2 × 12 = 24 ) than the fusion probability between two vesicles with 4 and 4 SNAREs ( 4 × 4 = 16 < 24 ) . In reality the ﬁrst example can only establish 2 pairs while the latter can form 4 > 2 . Accordingly , the present algorithm was set to evaluate the number of SNARE - pairs ( i , j ) between the vesicles a and b using min ( snare i in vesicle a , snare j in vesicle b ) . In this reﬁned model , it is optimal if two vesicles have a similar number of matching SNAREs while in the Heinrich and Rapoport [ 120 ] model it was sufﬁcient if just one partner contained a lot of SNAREs . More correctly , the SNARE interaction should be evaluated along the hierarchy of interactions , because one SNARE - molecule can only participate in one pair ( most probably with the most preferential conjugate molecule ) . 6 Since every vesicle pair has a different SNARE - combination , the complex reaction framework based on the Fokker - Planck equation [ 168 ] cannot be used . It would require too much computation time to evaluate the individual distance dependent reaction probability for every pair . 101 8 . VESICLE TRANSPORT AND THE COMPARTMENTALIZATION OF THE CELL Figure 8 . 5 : The part of the vesicle surface that is within the max - imal distance d max of the SNARE - interaction is highlighted in green . The interacting surface area A is calculated neglecting the curvature of the vesicle ( d max < < R ) as A = πR 2 with R = (cid:113) 12 ( R 2 v + R 2 w ) − 14 ( R v + R w − d max ) 2 − 14 ( R 2 v − R 2 w ) 2 / ( R v + R w − d max ) 2 ( number of cargo molecules , volume , etc . ) of both vesicles will be merged and stored only for the remaining vesicle . The new vesicle type is taken from a list which speciﬁes the new type based on the types of the fusing vesicles . Obviously , the fusion leads to an increased size of the resulting vesicle compared to each of the fusing vesicles . Since the new vesicle must not overlap with any other vesicle or structure , the new radius will only be applied if the distance to other structures or vesicles is big enough . Otherwise the vesicle will stay in a ’squeezed’ state until it has diffused away from the obstacle . Vesicle Fusion with the Plasma Membrane Vesicles can likewise fuse to the plasma membrane during exocytosis . The number of SNARE - molecules within the corresponding interaction area is calculated by counting the SNARE - proteins in the respective area ( the molecules are explicitly modeled in the plasma membrane ) . Upon fusion all cargo ( and vesicle machinery ) molecules of the vesicle are transfered to ex - plicitly modeled molecule - agents in the plasma membrane . Attaching to the Cytoskeleton – Motor Protein Transport As described in Section 4 . 4 . 3 agents can also bind to the cytoskeleton . For vesicle - agents the respective binding strength can be modulated by the number of motor proteins which are attached to the vesicle as cargo . The velocity by which the vesicle moves along the cytoskeleton is likewise modulated by the number of motor proteins . The tug of war between different directions ( see Figure 8 . 6 ) [ 275 ] is mimicked by the following implementation : ∆ x = v motor × ∆ t (cid:18) n motor + − n motor − n motor + + n motor − + ( ξ 1 − ξ 2 ) (cid:19) ( 8 . 3 ) where ξ 1 and ξ 2 are two independent random numbers from the uniform distribution . This Monte Carlo methods randomly choses the direction with a bias depending on the strength of the different motor proteins . 102 8 . 2 . Vesicle Model and Simulation Framework Figure 8 . 6 : Tug of war between the mo - tors of the plus and minus direction . This process is mimicked in the simulation by Equation ( 8 . 3 ) 8 . 2 . 3 Transport , Localization and Specialized Cytoskeleton Filaments Vesicles diffuse through the cell ( Equation 4 . 8 ) or can be transported along cytoskeleton ﬁl - aments by motor proteins ( Equation ( 8 . 3 ) . In order to improve the transport properties of the membrane trafﬁcking network a specialized cytoskeleton network has to be constructed . Special ﬁlaments can connect compartments and link them via speciﬁc budding sites . Actin cables that extend themselves from budding sites at the plasma membrane into the cell are pushed into the cell with the velocity v flow due to their continuous polymerization [ 209 ] . Vesi - cles that bind to these cables can be transported passively just by this ﬂow : ∆ x = v flow × ∆ t . 8 . 2 . 4 The Budding Process and the Role of Coat Molecules On the ﬁrst look , vesicle budding looks like a simple reaction in which new vesicles are created with a speciﬁc rate . However this rate is determined by the respective cargo for the new vesicle ( on demand ) and furthermore by the availability of the respective machinery molecules : the coats ( see Figure 8 . 2 , c ) . In the simulation , budding is initiated by the formation of a coat - cargo dimer based on the coat ( i ) - cargo ( j ) reaction rate constant ( see Figure 8 . 4 ) [ 283 ] . Then the coat is polymerized based on r coat i , polymerization = k coat i , coat i × c incompartmentcoat i × c inbudcoat i polymer ( 8 . 4 ) ( cf . Section 4 . 4 . 6 ) . During this time the new vesicle agent is pushed out of the donor compart - ment until it is completely separated – when the coat shell is completed ( deﬁned by N shell , which can be determined e . g . by cryo - electron microscopy and single particle analysis [ 285 ] ) . In case of speciﬁc budding sites linked to the cytoskeleton , it moves parallel to the respec - tive ﬁlament . Again , the motion steps of the donor compartment also have to consider the spatial restrictions of the related budding vesicle ( s ) . Once a complete coat shell is created and the vesicle is completely outside of the donor compartment , the new vesicle is free to diffuse / move by its own . Only at this timepoint the cargo , snare , and motor proteins are transferred to the vesicle based on the corresponding rate constants ( k coat i , cargo j , k coat i , snare j , k coat i , motor j , see Fig - 103 8 . VESICLE TRANSPORT AND THE COMPARTMENTALIZATION OF THE CELL ure 8 . 4 ) and the rates r coat i , cargo j = k coat i , cargo j × c inbudcoat i polymer × c incompartmentcargo j r coat i , snare j = k coat i , snare j × c inbudcoat i polymer × c incompartmentsnare j ( 8 . 5 ) r coat i , motor j = k coat i , motor j × c inbudcoat i polymer × c incompartmentmotor j Due to this approach the reaction has to be integrated over the whole budding time ( a constant cargo concentration is assumed ) . Additionally the saturation of the coats is included , cargo , snare , and motor proteins are only transferred into the vesicle up to a predeﬁned maximal number ( deﬁned as a fraction of N shell ) . Afterwards the coat starts to depolymerize based on a predeﬁned depolymerization function and the rate constant k depolymerization ( see Figure 8 . 4 ) . Only if this depolymerization proces is ﬁnished , the vesicle can fuse to another compart - ment . Vesicles can also bud from the plasma membrane in the endocytosis process ( mediated by the clathrin coat ) . In the plasma membrane all molecules are modeled explicitly . The coat poly - merization process is therefor modeled as a clustering of membrane bound coat molecules as described in Section 4 . 4 . 6 . This clustering framework is extended in order to include the cargo , snare , and motor proteins based on the respective reaction rate constants . Once the coat cluster has reached the required size of N shell , a new vesicle agent is created at the budding site and all coat , cargo , snare , and motor proteins are transferred into it . The vesicle is pushed away from the plasma membrane with a predeﬁned velocity due to the actin boost ( deﬁned by the polymerization rate of actin ) [ 137 , 149 , 209 ] . In the present model the vesicle moves perpendicular to the plasma with the velocity v actinboost . While the coat shell depolymerizes , the random walk of the undirected diffusion ( Equation 4 . 8 ) takes over : ∆ x = N polymerizedcoat ( t ) N shell (cid:126)v actinboost × ∆ t + N shell − N polymerizedcoat ( t ) N shell (cid:112) ( 2 D vesicle ∆ t ) × (cid:126)ξ ( 8 . 6 ) Figure 8 . 7 ) shows the clustering process , the directed path due to the actin boost , a diffusive search until the vesicle ﬁnds a cytoskeleton ﬁlament , and ﬁnally directed transport with motor proteins along that ﬁlament into the cell . 8 . 2 . 5 Vesicle Cargo and Reactions within the Vesicles Cargo molecules can interact with each other if a reaction is speciﬁed . The reactions of the vesicle machinery molecules ( i ) - ( iv ) have been explained separately because they govern the budding , transport , and fusion process . In addition , cargo molecules can be for example degraded or processed in the vesicles which changes their type . The discrimination between membrane bound ( v ) and luminal ( vi ) molecules is necessary because in the used mass action 104 8 . 2 . Vesicle Model and Simulation Framework based kinetics the concentrations have to be calculated based on the membrane surface or the vesicle volume respectively . It is assumed that the vesicles / compartments are small enough to assume well mixed conditions . The reaction probability is then calculated by Equation ( 4 . 31 ) . 8 . 2 . 6 Vesicle Cargo and Reactions with Cytoplasmic Molecules This class of reactions covers e . g . ( i ) the binding / dissociation of coats or motor proteins from a cytoplasmic pool to the vesicle , and ( ii ) the activation of signaling molecules in the cyto - plasma by active receptors in the vesicle . The same framework as for bimolecular reactions ( cf . Section 4 . 3 . 1 is used , now for each pair of vesicle and molecule agent . In accordance with the underlying mass action kinetics , the reaction rate constant is multiplied with the number of molecules of the respective species contained in the vesicle . Note , vesicle agents and molecule agents can overlap . If necessary , molecule agents are created or destroyed upon a reaction at the position of the vesicle agent , and the number of molecules in the vesicle is updated as well . 8 . 2 . 7 Concluding Remarks The present , novel vesicle model covers both the scale of the vesicles and the molecules of the machinery . The modularity of the setup simpliﬁed the identiﬁcation of functional parameter sets as shown in the next section . The most challenging part in the model setup was however the implementation of an efﬁcient handling of the non - overlapping vesicle motion . The mo - tion does not rely on repulsive forces , and is modeled as a random walk ( mimicking diffusion ) or linear transport along cytoskeleton tracks by motor proteins ) as described in Section 4 . 2 . 2 . Since budding and fusing vesicles move together with the partner , their interactions have to be considered while the motion of the respective vesicle - agent is executed . This required a complex logic , which ﬁnally was running error - free . Figure 8 . 7 : Endocytosis process in the simula - tion visualized at a section from the plasma mem - brane . Coat ( yellow ) , snare ( green ) , and cargo ( red , here a membrane bound receptor ) molecules clus - ter together and eventually form a vesicle ( large red sphere ) . This is pushed into the cell by the actin boost ( Equation ( 8 . 6 ) path shown in light blue ) and can subsequently bind to a cytoskeleton for transport with motor proteins ( path during diffusion and motor protein transport is shown in red ) . 105 8 . VESICLE TRANSPORT AND THE COMPARTMENTALIZATION OF THE CELL 8 . 3 Parameters of the Vesicle Model This section covers the interplay of the molecular species which promote vesicle budding , transport , targeting , and fusion in the cell . It also shows , how the parameters are adjusted in the detailed , dynamic , spatially structured and compartmentalized simulation environment . The constraints which limit the functionality of the model also reveal dependencies and pos - sible regulations within the network of the molecular vesicle machinery . 8 . 3 . 1 Budding Process and Recycling of Coat Molecules The vesicle budding process – the formation of the corresponding coat - shell – crucially de - pends on the abundance of coat molecules at the budding site ( cf . Equation ( 8 . 4 ) and Fig - ure 8 . 2 c ) . Once the vesicle is formed , the respective coat molecules are transported away together with the vesicle . If the coat molecules are not replaced by new coat molecules , the budding site will be quickly depleted [ 84 ] . Figure 8 . 4 and 8 . 8 show how coat molecules cycle between a cytosolic pool and the compartment membrane . The afﬁnity of the coat molecules for a given compartment ( i . e . for a given membrane ) is modeled by adding special ’coat catching molecules’ with the rate r coat i binding = k coat i , coatbinding j × c cytoplasmcoat i × c invesiclecoatcatcher j ( 8 . 7 ) The ’coat catching molecules’ are bound to the compartment and accordingly regulate the binding of the coat to the compartment 7 . The different compartments should have different characteristics and as such different ’catching molecules’ . This leads to a preference for dif - ferent coats , and – since the coats themselves show a preference for different cargo , SNARE , and motor proteins ( cf . Equation ( 8 . 5 ) ) – thus the selectivity and directionality of the trans - port is regulated . In the discrete framework which covers every coat - polymerization event , the coat concentra - tion in the donor membrane shows every single budding process ( cf . Figure D . 12 ) . In order to have similar conditions for subsequent budding events , the recovery rate of coat monomers in the membrane should be large enough to restore the initial conditions prior to the next event . It can be concluded from this fact , that the turnover between membrane bound and free coat molecules should be high ( i . e . large binding and dissociation rates as reported by Presley et al . [ 246 ] ) . Also , a sufﬁcient number of free coat molecules in the cytosol is needed . This conclusion is supported by the ﬁndings of Forster et al . [ 86 ] reporting a cytosolic fraction 7 In reality , the binding depends on the lipid composition of the membrane and further subspecies of the coat [ 66 , 84 , 120 ] . This was only implicitly included in the model of Heinrich and Rapoport [ 120 ] by the sole afﬁnity of the coats for a compartment . The ’coat catching molecules’ lead to a more realistic model and can simply be treated as cargo if desired / necessary and thus be shuttled with vesicles to other compartments . 106 8 . 3 . Parameters of the Vesicle Model Figure 8 . 8 : Coat molecules are recycled via a cytoplasmic pool of unbound molecules . Motor proteins can be recycled via recycling vesicles or a cytoplasmic pool . Snares can only be recycled via recycling vesicles . Figure D . 12 in the appendix shows this process in the data of a simulation . of about 50 % . In the present model therefore a high coat binding and unbinding rate constant is speciﬁed . 8 . 3 . 2 Recycling of SNAREs and Motor Proteins As shown in Figure 8 . 8 , the same recycling approach as for coat molecules can also be as - sumed for motor proteins [ 155 ] . In contrast to coat molecules the dissociation rate has to be slow for motor proteins because otherwise vesicles which need them would lose them too quickly . Accordingly the binding rate has to be slow , so that a reasonable steady state can evolve in each compartment . Therefore a low motor binding and unbinding rate constant is speciﬁed in the present model : donor compartment bound motors are incorporated into the vesicle during the budding process ( cf . Equation ( 8 . 5 ) ) . Then they transport the vesicle to the target compartment , to which they are integrated . From there they slowly dissolve into the cytosol and eventually diffuse back to the donor compartment , where they bind to the respec - tive ’motor catching proteins’ ( in analogy to the binding of the coats , Equation 8 . 7 ) . Thus the presence of motors in each donor compartment depends on its ’motor catching protein’ settings 8 . SNARE proteins in contrast cannot diffuse through the cytosol . If they did , the compart - 8 Alternatively , motors could be transported back on vesicles going into the reverse direction . Then however , the vesicle could only carry less motors of the kind that has to be recycled than the motors needed for their own transportation . Otherwise the carrier motors would most likely lose the tug of war between both kinds of motors and the vesicle is transported back to its donor compartment - or more correctly : it would never leave it . Thus the total number of motors which is needed for the vesicle transport between two compartments can only be recycled either in an at least partly inactive state via vesicles or via diffusion through the cytosol . 107 8 . VESICLE TRANSPORT AND THE COMPARTMENTALIZATION OF THE CELL ment identity would diffuse away with them . Since SNAREs cannot be created in every compartment , they have to be recycled or otherwise be transported towards the compartment where they are needed . Such SNAREs that are only transported – but are not meant to be the SNAREs determining the target of the vesicle – still interfere with the vesicle addressing process . In the two compartment model introduced by Heinrich and Rapoport [ 120 ] there - fore 98 % of the recycling vesicles fuse with their donor compartments , only 2 % reach their target . If the spatial aspects are included , the backward fusion rate would be even higher because the vesicles are initially much closer to the donor compartment , which translates into an increased fusion probability ( cf . Section 8 . 4 ) . As soon as the directed transport with motor proteins is included in the model , the recycling of SNAREs becomes much easier . Vesicle transport is now determined by the motor proteins . SNAREs in a vesicle will only interact with those SNAREs of the compartment which they are transported to by motor proteins . Provided that the motorized transport worked correctly , the recycled SNAREs are just an additional cargo of the vesicle . Figure D . 12 shows how a stationary SNARE distribution develops in a two compartment system . Since the correct tar - geting of the vesicles evolves out of the transport with motor proteins along the cytoskeleton , the cell does not need a separate set of t - and v - SNAREs for every transport route but can reuse the same SNAREs for several connections ( in agreement to [ 106 ] ) . 8 . 3 . 3 Parametrization of the Model ( 1 ) First of all , the compartments need to be deﬁned , i . e . their size and the number of coat , cargo , snare , and motor proteins has to be declared . Likewise the number of free coats and motor proteins in the cytoplasm has to be deﬁned . Based on the desired exchange between the membrane bound and free cytoplasmic pool the respective binding and dissociation rates for coat and motor proteins can then be assigned . ( 2 ) The time for the budding process is determined by the polymerization into the coat shell , i . e . by the coat concentration in the donor compartment and k coat i , coat i . Based on the pre - set coat concentration k coat i , coat i can then be adjusted so that the budding process is accomplished within the desired time . ( 3 ) The loading of cargo / snare / motor proteins is described by Equation ( 8 . 5 ) , which has to be integrated over the actual budding time . Given that this budding time is close to the desired set point ( deﬁned above ) , the desired cargo / snare / motor concentration in the vesicles is reached by adjusting k coat i , cargo j , k coat i , snare j , k coat i , motor j ( the cargo / snare / motor concentration in the donor compartment should be close to the initial values , and the average coat concentration in the budding vesicle is given by N shell ) . As such , budding leads to vesicles which stochas - tically vary around the desired set - point of the cargo / SNARE / motor protein numbers in the present stochastic simulation . 108 8 . 3 . Parameters of the Vesicle Model ( 4 ) Based on the SNARE concentration in the vesicle and in the target compartment ﬁnally k snare i , snare j and k ( 0 ) per pair can be adjusted to reach the desired fusion / bouncing probability in Equation ( 8 . 2 ) . ( 5 ) Recycling of the vesicle machinery compounds as described in the previous sections is required in order to keep the process at the desired set - point . 8 . 3 . 4 Fine Tuning of the Molecular Interactions in Vesicle Transport The ﬁne tuning of the parameters and interactions shows interesting properties of the vesicle transport process . The following points highlight how the functionality and efﬁciency of vesicle transport can be assured . Inﬂuence of the Coat on the Backward Fusion Probability Since the recycling of the SNAREs has to occur alongside with the regular vesicle transport , the reduction of the backward fusion probability is of great importance for the functioning of the vesicle transport system . One possibility to achieve this goal might come from the coat which formed the vesicles . As shown in Figure 8 . 2 c , the coat around the vesicle breaks apart from it during the transport process and can be recycled . However , the coat which formed the vesicle could as well shield it against fusion events . If the depolymerization process of the coat starts only once the vesicle is far enough away from the donor compartment , the backward fusion probability is reduced . Recent ﬁndings indicate that the coat dissociates only after tethering with the target compartment [ 43 ] . In the present model vesicles can only fuse if their coat is complete depolymerized , which is governed by k depolymerization . A slower k depolymerization indeed reduced the backward fusion probablity ( data not shown ) . The clathrin coat , which mediates endocytosis at the plasma membrane , provides an even stronger way of preventing a back - fusion : the involved actin polymerization leads to an actin boost that pushes the vesicle away from the plasma membrane ( see Equation 8 . 6 ) [ 137 , 149 , 209 ] . The impact of the actin boost depends on its duration , the resulting transport velocity and the fraction of the resulting force that is perpendicular to the plasma membrane . Once the vesicle is far enough away from the plasma membrane , it can employ a diffusive search strategy for the target without an oversize risk of returning to the plasma membrane . Again the simulation shows that the backward fusion probability decreases if the actin boost acts stronger ( faster velocity or slower coat depolymerization , cf . Equation 8 . 6 ) . Vesicle Fusion and SNARE - Interaction The description of the vesicle fusion based on matching SNARE combinations implies that nonmatching vesicles will actually bounce off of the nontarget compartment . However , there 109 8 . VESICLE TRANSPORT AND THE COMPARTMENTALIZATION OF THE CELL are no reports discussing or showing these rejected vesicles . The absence of reports describing bounced vesicles can lead to two conclusions : ( i ) this effect has not yet been investigated , or ( ii ) the vesicle sorting and transport machinery is efﬁcient enough to lead every vesicle to its correct target . Then however the SNARE interaction is not relevant for the targeting process , because the target selection occurs at an earlier stage . In the present simulation , in turn , vesicles were bounced frequently – even matching pairs might need several collisions until they ﬁnally fuse together . This suggests , that the actual fusion of vesicles has to be observed with a greater spatial and temporal resolution in future experiments . Based on more detailed studies of vesicle paths the vesicle model then needs further adjustments . Regulation of the Budding Process : Cargo Dependent Budding ( On Demand ) The cargo molecules in the donor compartment can control the vesicle formation process by regulating the turnover of coat molecules [ 80 , 86 ] . This makes sense because otherwise the cell would form many empty yet costly vesicles . Two properties in the present simulation account for this fact : 1 . the probability for a budding event depends on the cargo concentration in the donor compartment . A cargo - coat - dimer , which is formed based on Equation ( 8 . 5 ) , initiates the budding event in the simulation . If no cargo is present , no vesicles will be formed . 2 . the number of cargo molecules that are incorporated into a vesicle depends on the cargo concentration and the budding time as described above . The more cargo molecules are present , the more cargo can bind to the coat molecules - up to a saturation level . Thus the cargo ﬂux depends on the cargo level in the donor compartment . This feature will also be discussed in the next chapter on receptor mediated endocytosis , where it is employed to regulate signal transduction . 8 . 3 . 5 Conclusions The parametrization of the model covers three aspects : i The functionality of the model has to be established based on the modular coat - SNARE - etc . - machinery . Despite the uncertainty of the parameters , the given model is in agree - ment with the ﬁndings of Presley et al . [ 246 ] and Forster et al . [ 86 ] in stating that a fast exchange between the cytoplasmic and membrane bound pool of coat molecules is needed . In addition , it predicts that motor proteins are recycled via a cytoplasmic pool as well and that the exchange between the pools has to be slow . Furthermore it highlights the role of coat molecules in the prevention of back - fusion events . 110 8 . 4 . Spatial Aspects of Vesicle Transport ii In a 3D model , also the functionality of the model regarding the targeted translocation of the vesicles through the ( structured ) intracellular space is important . This will be described in the next section . Obviously both aspects are intertwined because the ( local chemical interaction ) fusion ma - chinery can only be tested given that the physical transport of the vesicle is working correctly . Since transport with motor proteins is assumed , the ( chemical ) loading of motor proteins dur - ing vesicle budding yet requires a functional vesicle machinery . This also requires that the concentrations of the molecules of the vesicle machinery remain constant : iii The maintenance of a functional system can be established by recycling of the compo - nents . Coat , SNARE , and motor proteins are recycled on different routes as shown in Figure 8 . 8 . 8 . 4 Spatial Aspects of Vesicle Transport In this work , the transport properties of a simple two - compartment system have been eval - uated within several virtual cytoskeleton network architectures as well as with and without motor proteins . The two initial compartments are sufﬁciently loaded with cargo , SNAREs , and motor proteins so that functional vesicles can be formed during the budding process . The parameters are adjusted as described in the previous section and given in Appendix D . 5 . 1 together with a quantitative , statistical evaluation of the results . 8 . 4 . 1 Results Figure 8 . 9 shows several possible cellular architectures with sample tracks of vesicles in a two compartment system . ( a ) Diffusion alone distributes the vesicles everywhere in the cell . Only a few vesicles reach the correct target compartment within a reasonable time – despite the fact , that the compartments are closer together than in all other setups . ( b ) If the cytoskeleton is randomly arranged , vesicles following these tracks with motor proteins are not able to reach the target compartment either . The motion is still random , just on another scale . If the random network structure contains ’sinks’ , the vesicles will eventually end up there . ( c ) In contrast , a direct connection leads to an optimal transport of the vesicles - they all reach their target directly . It is worth noting , that the budding site has to be connected directly to the cytoskeleton ﬁlaments in this case . If the vesicle buds somewhere else , 111 8 . VESICLE TRANSPORT AND THE COMPARTMENTALIZATION OF THE CELL Figure 8 . 9 : Spatial aspects of vesicle transport in a two compartment system .

Orange vesicles bud from the orange com - partment 1 , targeted for the green compartment 2 . Green vesicles go into the opposite direction . Parameters and the statistic evaluation of the transport properties are given in Appendix D . 5 . 1 . Visu - alized with POV - Ray as described in Appendix C . diffusion might drive it away from the track . Accordingly , the proteins anchoring the compartment to the cytoskeleton should have a connection to the vesicle budding ma - chinery e . g . the coat molecules in this case . This is well in agreement with the ﬁndings of Kirk and Ward [ 150 ] , reporting that there are special exit sites in the ER ( for the ER to Golgi transport ) and that they co - localize with microtubules . This isolated setup is functional , but the question remains , how this structure can be embedded into the cell : 112 8 . 4 . Spatial Aspects of Vesicle Transport ( d ) Interestingly , a linearly polarized cytoskeleton between the compartments does not lead to a high rate of fusion events . While the vesicles go into the right direction ( but ran - domly switch the tracks ) , they can easily miss the target compartment and ﬁnally accu - mulate at the plasma membrane . ( e ) This leads to the conclusion , that a ’good’ cytoskeleton structure focuses vesicles onto the target compartment . For a two compartment system the respective structure equals the electric ﬁeld of two separated point charges with charge q 1 = + q and q 2 = − q at x 1 and x 2 respectively : (cid:126)E ( (cid:126)x ) = q const (cid:126)x − (cid:126)x 1 (cid:107) (cid:126)x − (cid:126)x 1 (cid:107) 3 − q const (cid:126)x − (cid:126)x 2 (cid:107) (cid:126)x − (cid:126)x 2 (cid:107) 3 ( 8 . 8 ) [ 317 ] . In the ﬁgure all vectors have the same length to highlight the direction of the ﬁeld . The same results are obtained in a two - compartment system that is created by the plasma membrane and an endosome in the center of the cell . Endo - and exocytosis connect these compartments as shown in Figure 8 . 10 . Again diffusion is not able to transport the vesicles towards the target . A radial cytoskeleton directly connects the endosome in the center of the cell with the plasma membrane and thus provides a functional structure for vesicle transport with motor proteins . It is worth noting , that this ’monopole’ structure corresponds to both , the ’dipole’ structure ( d ) and the direct connection ( c ) of the previous two compartment model due to the spherical symmetry . 8 . 4 . 2 Discussion Diffusion alone distributes the vesicles everywhere in the cell . Only a few vesicles reach the correct target compartment . As such , the fusion probability for diffusing vesicles depends on the following three parameters : 1 . Afﬁnity = SNARE - interactions : Vesicles / compartments with better matching SNAREs show a higher fusion probability . 2 . Distance : The probability to hit the target will be higher if the vesicle is closer to it . 3 . Target size : Likewise a larger target is easier found by the random walk process . As pointed out above , the SNARE interaction is rather promiscuous [ 43 , 277 ] . In the multi - compartmented cell diffusion is a bad mode of transportation , not just because it might take a little longer until the target is reached but because the vesicle might hit so many wrong compartments on the way to the right one . Depending on the fusion probability , it can fuse to 113 8 . VESICLE TRANSPORT AND THE COMPARTMENTALIZATION OF THE CELL Figure 8 . 10 : Spatial aspects of vesicle transport in endo - and exocytosis . Comparison of diffusion and transport with motor proteins ( red : endocytic vesicles ; green : recycling vesicles from the big green endosome in the center ) . Parameters and the statistic evaluation of the transport properties are given in Appendix D . 5 . 1 . one of them instead of the actual target . The previous results have shown principles how vesicle transport is organized in the cell based on the action of motor proteins . It requires an appropriate cytoskeleton structure which connects the compartments . Two principle structures were identiﬁed here : 1 . a ( local ) direct connection 2 . a global cytoskeleton structure , which together with the motor proteins creates a ’force ﬁeld’ that focuses all vesicles onto the right target . Either way of connecting compartments has its advantage : a direct connection is highly ef - ﬁcient – but if a vesicle happens to dissociate from it , the vesicle will diffuse away and will be lost in space . A cytoskeleton structure capturing and focusing diffusing vesicles is less specialized yet more robust . It can capture diffusing vesicles everywhere in the cell and guide them to the target . However , for more than two compartments – and the cell has more than two – there will always exist a boundary between two possible directions of the ﬁeld . At this divide a further force would have to be introduced in order to control that vesicles end up on the correct side . Figure 8 . 11 shows , how the ( local ) cytoskeleton structure can improve the targeting of the vesicles by increasing the effective cross section of the target . In addition , the cytoskeleton structure can also controll cell polarization . The targeting of vesicles would then be a combi - nation of directed motion with motor proteins along the cytoskeleton ﬁlaments and undirected motion of diffusion . The cytoskeleton focuses the motion of vesicles into the right direction , 114 8 . 4 . Spatial Aspects of Vesicle Transport Figure 8 . 11 : ( a ) Cytoskeleton ﬁlaments around a compartment increase the effective radius of the target compartment by capturing vesicles which are then transported with motor proteins towards the target , thus increasing the fusion probability of vesicles . ( b ) Actin cables in yeast can lead to a polar - ization of the cell by directing the vesicles to one target area in the plasma membrane ( the respective system and model is described in Chapter 9 ) . The polarization was shown e . g . by Valdez - Taubas and Pelham [ 308 ] . The microscope image is reprinted from [ 308 ] with permission from Elsevier . and vesicles employ diffusion as a random search strategy both to ﬁnd the cytoskeleton track and ﬁnally to ﬁnd the target on the track 9 . The latter case exists on the direct connections between two compartments as well as on the actin cables in yeast endo - and exocytosis [ 209 ] . There , the vesicles ﬁrst ’condensate’ onto the cable , then walk along it and subsequently form an endosome to which further vesicles can fuse . The same holds for the ER - Golgi intermediate compartments ( ERGICS ) found be - tween the ER and Golgi [ 66 ] . Besides the active navigation through the cytoskeleton structure there can be a passive regu - lation of the access to certain compartments as well : the cytoskeleton can block the way . The two main compartments of the simulations were caged in the cytoskeleton network and could not move away . Likewise the probability of an unintentional fusion with large compartments can be reduced . For instance , it is highly likely to reach the relatively large plasma membrane by diffusion because it is evenly distributed around the cell . In order to reduce the collision probability , the access to the plasma membrane could be restricted by an impenetrable actin network . Since actin mainly polymerizes along the plasma membrane [ 3 ] , vesicles that are too large to pass through the meshes of the actin network cannot reach the plasma membrane . Still , the actin network could catch and store the vesicles close to the surface until they are needed , for instance at a synapse . Any regulation of the actin cytoskeleton e . g . by Ca 2 + can accordingly control vesicle fusion at the plasma membrane [ 109 , 241 ] . 9 Vesicles can randomly rotate around the ﬁlament that they are walking on ( at least in the simulation ) . The diffusion process around the ﬁlament is needed to ﬁnd the target – otherwise the target site has to be perfectly aligned with the budding site on the track . Note that the dimensionality is reduced on the surface of the track , which alters the properties of the diffusion - reaction process [ 21 , 300 ] , favoring vesicle fusion . The rotation around the ﬁlament also helps to avoid unintended collisions with vesicles that move into the opposite direction . 115 8 . VESICLE TRANSPORT AND THE COMPARTMENTALIZATION OF THE CELL Embedding the Membrane Trafficking Network into the Cytoskeleton Endoplasmic Reticulum Golgi Secretory Vesicles Lysosomes + - + + + + + + + + Recycling Vesicles Endosomes Endosomes Figure 8 . 12 : Tripartition of the microtubule cytoskeleton structure by the different membrane trafﬁcking connections ( based on [ 4 , 57 , 176 ] ) . The three sectors are indicated by the color ( red : exocytosis , blue : endocytosis , yellow : Golgi - ER . The green arrows indicate the transport of vesicles between the sectors , probably based on other cytoskeleton structures . 8 . 4 . 3 Cytoskeleton Architecture for a Multi - Compartment Model – Challenges for Future Modeling The cell contains more than two compartments , which requires an elaborate cytoskeleton ar - chitecture . Directing vesicles to one compartment cannot be treated separated from other compartments in the cell because motorized vesicles can in principle follow any nearby cy - toskeleton ﬁlament . In vivo , the microtubule network provides a centered structure in the cell . In a reasonable network , central compartments should be found in the center of the structure . This is true for the Golgi stacks [ 294 ] , and the Golgi apparatus can even control the microtubules [ 45 ] . Accordingly , the Golgi is the central compartment of the membrane trafﬁcking network not only regarding its function but also its location [ 15 , 256 , 294 ] . The ER , where all proteins are translated , is tightly and directly connected to the Golgi via microtubules [ 4 , 57 , 176 , 177 ] . Likewise the sink of the secretory pathway should be in a central position , and indeed late endosomes and lysosomes are reported to be in a perinuclear region [ 66 , 125 ] . The cor - responding network setup is shown in Figure 8 . 12 . Three issues arise from this combined cytoskeleton and compartment map : 1 . Tripartition : The radial microtubule starlike structure is divided into three sections : ( i ) the ER - Golgi transport section , ( ii ) exocytic tracks from the Golgi to the plasma membrane , and ( iii ) the endocytic tracks to the degradation / re - sorting compartments . 116 8 . 5 . Conclusions and Outlook In principle these three areas could be mixed and overlapping , which might be useful for cell functionality but increases the complexity in vesicle targeting . 2 . Control : The threepartitioned microtubule structure has to be organized and main - tained by the cell . This holds especially for the divide between Golgi and Lysosomes . 3 . Cross Linking : The parts have to be crosslinked . Somehow the Golgi connects the ER with the exocytic section in the secretory pathway . There is also a branch which leads to the endosomes and lysosomes , connecting the third part . Likewise at least the membrane lipids should be recycled from the lysosomes back to the endosomes and the Golgi . The proposed network with its initial bias of directions can explain cell polarization and why the Golgi / centrosome has to move if the direction of cell polarization is changing [ 25 , 173 ] : The whole structure is not spherically symmetric but has both an endocytic , and exocytic side , which corresponds to a front and backward side of the cell . For cells specialized in transcytosis this orientation could be further optimized along this transport route in a linear orientation . The complex sorting and structuring into the three sections as well as the global orientation requires an additional control from the periphery e . g . by the actin cytoskeleton [ 25 , 71 ] . While the global structure is in principle deﬁned by the star of microtubules , the ﬁner structure and especially the cross linking of the different sectors could emerge by a subtle action of motor proteins , crosslinking and reorganizing the ﬁlaments [ 288 ] . As shown by von Blume et al . [ 318 ] , dynamic actin remodeling also plays a role in the cargo sorting process in the trans - Golgi network . In order to resolve the dynamic co - localization of vesicles to the cytoskeleton detailed live cell microscopy methods are needed [ 162 ] . 8 . 5 Conclusions and Outlook The present model is the ﬁrst vesicle transport model tracking individual ( agent based ) vesi - cles through the complete cell . This ﬁrst step towards a systems - oriented understanding of vesicle transport does not only include the vesicles and compartments as such but also the molecular vesicle machinery . This has the advantage that the control of the molecular interac - tions on the sorting and transport events can be explored . But it also leads to a more complex model . The modular structure and the sequential actions of vesicle transport nevertheless al - lowed the parametrization of the model which led to a functional setup . The constraints of the possible parameter sets also revealed further principles of vesicle transport : the true function can be worked out in a process of elimination of models and parameter sets that did not work . So far , the present vesicle model is able to reproduces budding , transport , and fusion events . The time constants of the reactions and transport processes are only set relatively to each other and do not necessarily match with reality . This is owing to the fact , that present experimental 117 8 . VESICLE TRANSPORT AND THE COMPARTMENTALIZATION OF THE CELL results mainly focus on the functional and qualitative identiﬁcation of molecular interactions and vesicle pathways but not on the dynamics of the system . Furthermore detailed spatiotem - poral data are necessary to adjust the model . Especially the cytoskeleton model used in the simulations is far away from reality . The orig - inally dynamic and ﬂexible ﬁlaments are represented by static and rigid cylinders . The direc - tion and orientation of the cylinders can be aligned with a polarization pattern . This pattern then mimics the actual structure of the cytoskeleton , for example the star of microtubules . Based on a polarized cytoskeleton , the present simulation is also able to reproduce the polar - ization of the yeast membrane due to vesicle transport ( cf . Chapter 9 ) [ 308 ] . Future work should accordingly focus on obtaining a more realistic cytoskeleton . The dis - tribution of cytoskeleton ﬁlaments and their overall orientation in the cell can be derived from microscopy images . These images , however , do not show a reasonable road network like textbook images but rather an irregular structure . Linking it to the membrane trafﬁcking road map will be challenging . Therefore advanced live cell imaging techniques are required to extract cytoskeleton information and vesicle tracks together . The fact , that every species [ 160 ] , cell type , and cell cycle state show differences in the cytoskeleton structure further - more increases these difﬁculties [ 3 ] . It should also be kept in mind , that the forces governing the self - assembly process of the cytoskeleton [ 173 , 288 ] are not yet understood in sufﬁcient detail to reconstruct the cytoskeleton architecture and dynamics on the cellular level with a computer model . This holds especially for the ﬁne structure and subtle concinnity governing the vesicle - cytoskeleton interplay . The current model has to be repeatedly tested against experimental results and improved in an iterative , data driven way , for instance by comparing the visualized results with life cell images [ 77 , 78 ] . In turn , image analysis techniques reveal important data like the structure of the cytoskeleton [ 82 , 200 ] , the structure of the coat cage [ 285 ] , or the path of the vesicles [ 140 ] , which can be used to adjust the parameters of the model . Altogether , the advances in modeling and visualization techniques provide a tool to investigate the functionality and char - acteristics that emerge out of the nontrivial interactions in complex systems like membrane trafﬁcking . Finally , the deﬁnition of the identity or type of compartments is another challenge in the dynamic vesicle network . After all , the membrane trafﬁcking network consists of many sub - types of compartments , which dynamically develop , change or maturate . The identity of the compartment can be related to its content . Alternatively it could be related to the history of the compartments which themselves then depends on the history of their donor compartments ( and so on ) . Both , the event based simulation algorithm and imaging technologies tracking individual vesicles can record the history of every compartment . A detailed map of budding and fusion events can then be extracted from these records in order to relate both concepts of the compartment identity – thus connecting function , content , and lineage of the vesicles . 118 Chapter 9 Receptor Mediated Endocytosis : Coupling of Signaling and Membrane Trafﬁcking in Time and Space The output of each signal transduction module is naturally determined by the input . As such the number of receptor molecules regulates signal transduction at the most prominent posi - tion within the cascade . A larger number of active receptors leads to a stronger signal . The receptor number , in turn , is governed by the degradation and assembly rate of receptors ( see Figure 9 . 1 ) . Both steps occur in a membrane trafﬁcking pathway : ( i ) the secretory pathway from the ER via the Golgi to the plasma membrane , and ( ii ) endocytosis via endosomes to - wards the lysosome . A stationary number of receptors is reached if both rates are balanced . Figure 9 . 1 : Regulation of the number of receptors by receptor mediated endocytosis . Subsequent degradation of the receptors can be balanced by the exocytosis of new receptors . Alternatively , re - ceptors can be recycled . Reprinted from Wiley et al . [ 330 ] with permission from Elsevier . 119 9 . COUPLING OF SIGNALING AND MEMBRANE TRAFFICKING The activated receptor with a bound ligand is able to trigger its endocytosis [ 282 ] . This topic – receptor mediated endocytosis – is well explored for example for the Ste2p receptor activated by the mating pheromone α in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae [ 210 , 299 , 302 ] or the EGF receptor [ 48 , 330 ] . Ligand binding activates not only the signal transduction but also the endocytosis of the receptor . This changes the number of plasma membrane bound receptors and thus the output of the signal transduction cascade [ 282 ] . The production of new receptors , in turn , is ultimately regulated by the transcription fac - tors controlling the respective genes . These transcription factors are activated by regulatory networks which involve the input of one or several signal transduction pathways . This can include the pathway triggered by the receptor itself , closing a feedback loop in the signal - ing network . Thus , the activation of the receptor can control the number of receptors in the cell . In addition , receptors ( stripped from the ligands ) can be recycled back to the plasma membrane from the intracellular pool [ 282 ] . On top of a continuous creation and destruction of receptors in the secretory and endocytic pathway respectively , the recycling could be an efﬁcient means for the necessary adaptation of the receptor number to the current strength of the external signal . However , it requires an advanced sorting procedure in the endosomes , targeting receptors either for degradation or recycling [ 125 , 187 , 291 , 304 ] . It is worth noting , that the endocytosis of receptors also creates an intracellular pool of active receptors in so called signaling endosomes [ 204 , 282 ] . Thus even weak signals can sustain long enough to trigger gene activation , especially when the signaling endosome is itself trans - ported into the perinuclear region [ 24 , 128 , 141 ] . Each regulatory regime in this system covers different timescales : ﬁrst the chemical acti - vation of the signaling compounds acting within seconds to minutes , then the endocytosis of the receptors occurring in the range of 5 - 20 minutes [ 302 , 330 ] , and ﬁnally the manifold of steps towards the degradation of the receptors but likewise the recreation via transcription and translation to the ﬁnal protein . The evolving complexity as well as the compartmentalization requires advanced methods for the analysis of the coupled effects [ 251 , 330 ] . So far , these models were built by ordinary differential equations , which neglect spatial aspects and the stochasticity of the process [ 48 , 330 ] . The simple kinetic expressions for the different shut - tling steps ( e . g . in Figure 9 . 1 ) also omit the detailed regulations of the vesicle machinery as discussed in the previous chapter . The present work aims at simulating the coupled endocytosis and signaling process with the agent - based framework based on a detailed model . It includes the stochasticity and the spatial aspects . In addition , also the molecular interactions of the vesicle machinery are included in the model as shown in Figure 9 . 2 . 120 9 . 1 .

COUPLING OF SIGNALING AND MEMBRANE TRAFFICKING 9 . 2 Results The interplay between receptor mediated endocytosis and signal transduction can be explored with the present simulation method . The manifold of membrane trafﬁcking compartments is reduced to one endosome in a central position of the cytoskeleton , next to the nucleus . Vesi - cles can transport receptors ( both active with a bound ligand and inactive ones ) from the endosome to the plasma membrane and vice versa . At t = 0 s the ligand is added leading to a fast activation of nearly all receptors ( R ) in the plasma membrane by the formation of the receptor - ligand ( RL ) complex ( see Figure 9 . 3 ) . This triggers endocytosis which reduces the number of active receptors in the plasma mem - brane . The receptors are quickly deactivated in the endosome and partly recycle back to the plasma membrane . Due to the time for the budding and transport process , the receptors only arrive with a delay in the endosome . The budding process at the plasma membrane and the endosome depends on the number of receptors as described in the previous section . Thus the increased number of receptors in the endosome increases the recycling ﬂux to the plasma membrane while the endocytic ﬂux is reduced due to the lower number of active receptors . Finally , a steady state is reached . The excerpt in Figure 9 . 3 shows the irregular budding frequency and the cargo load of the vesicles which lead to a sawtooth shape . The strong ﬂuctuations in the receptor number fun - damentally differ from the stable number obtained from differential equations or the normal Figure 9 . 3 : The receptors ( R ) are activated by the binding of the ligand ( RL = receptor ligand complex ) and subsequently transported from the plasma membrane ( PM ) via transport vesicles ( iT = in transit ) to the en - dosome ( E ) . ( RL ) is deactivated in the endosome . Therefore the number of inactive receptors ( R ) in ( E ) is increased . The number of active recep - tor ligand complexes ( RL ) is reduced due to the endocytosis and deacti - vation reactions . Accordingly , also the number of active MAPKp signaling molecules is reduced . The excerpt of the receptor ligand complex ( RL ) on the left shows single budding events from which the budding frequency and the cargo load of the endocytic vesicles can be derived . 122 9 . 2 . Results ﬂuctuations in stochastic models . The ﬂux of receptors can be adjusted ( i ) by the number of receptors transported in a vesicle ( up to a saturation limit ) and ( ii ) by the budding frequency of the vesicles and hence the number of vesicles . Figure 9 . 3 also shows , that the number of active MAPKp signaling molecules ( both in the cy - toplasm and the nucleus ) is equally reduced when the number of active receptors is reduced . This shows how the number of active receptors regulates the strength of the output of the signal transduction . Note , that the same parameters as in Section 6 . 1 are used . The active receptors accumulate in the endosome . Accordingly the MAPK molecules can be activated there as well . However , the number of active receptors in the ’signaling endosome’ is rather small ( due to the fast deactivation of the receptors ) . At least with the present param - eters , the remaining active receptors in the endosome do not increase the signaling output – although they are closer to the nucleus . It is worth noting , that signal transduction can trigger the polarization of the cell . The Ste2p receptor complex also recruits Cdc42 which controls the actin cytoskeleton ( cf . Figure 5 . 11 ) [ 154 , 209 , 247 ] . This leads to the formation of a mating projection and the polarization of the yeast cell [ 210 , 247 , 299 , 302 , 308 ] . Figure 9 . 4 shows the model cell and the path of the transport vesicles . Due to the slightly polarized shape of the cytoskeleton , exocytic vesicles Figure 9 . 4 : Molecules , vesicle paths and cytoskeleton structure vi - sualized with POV - Ray as described in Appendix C . The same cy - toskeleton structure as in Section 6 . 1 , Figure 6 . 3 is used . SNAREs ( blue ) and Receptors ( red ) accumulate on the left . Endocytic vesicle tracks are shown in red , recycling paths in green . The polarization of the cell is in agreement with the ﬁndings of Valdez - Taubas and Pel - ham [ 308 ] for the SNARE Snc1 . The microscope image is reprinted from [ 308 ] with permission from Elsevier . 123 9 . COUPLING OF SIGNALING AND MEMBRANE TRAFFICKING tend to end up at the left of the cell – leading to an accumulation of receptors and SNAREs on the left . The slow diffusion in the plasma membrane preserves their polarized distribution . This is in agreement with the ﬁndings of Valdez - Taubas and Pelham [ 308 ] . Receptors that are redistributed by this endocytic cycling process could increase the signal and the polarization of the cell in a stabilizing feedback loop . The corresponding signaling cascade is especially able to sense gradients in the concentration of the external ligand [ 221 , 247 , 332 ] . 9 . 3 Discussion For the ﬁrst time , the receptor mediated endocytosis process has been realized in spatially structured cell . It has the advantage , that 1 . It covers the coupling of the vesicle simulation with the agent based molecule tracking of signaling molecules in the model cell . Thus the inﬂuence of the changing receptor numbers on the signal transduction can be explored . 2 . It includes the description of the vesicle actions based on molecular interactions . This leads to a detailed description of receptor mediated endocytosis . The interaction be - tween the receptors and the coat molecules triggers the formation of the vesicles . 3 . It preserves the delays of the endocytosis and vesicle transport process . Appendix D . 6 . 3 outlines how these delays could also be described by ( delay ) differential equations . Nevertheless , the detailed simulation requires much more parameters than spatially homo - geneous sets of ordinary differential equations as already discussed in the previous chapters . Thus the accuracy of this method relies on the availability and quality of the parameters . The same holds for the cytoskeleton architecture . A major drawback of the present simulation is the stationary cytoskeleton structure and cell shape which does not allow dynamic modeling of cell polarization . Due to these limitations , the present model is only a small and preliminary model of the com - plete process , especially when compared to the successes and predictions of large scale ODE models [ 48 , 330 ] . Still , the present simulation allows a much more detailed view into the cou - pling of signaling and endocytosis . It contains the delays and discrete events evolving from the vesicle transport and preserves the spatial and stochastic aspects . Thus this work does not only follow academic interest for a deeper understanding but might promote the ﬁnding of better cures for example against heart attacks or cancer : The LDL receptor as well as the cholesterol sensing SREBP pathway require membrane trafﬁcking steps and need to be con - trolled in order to reduce cholesterol synthesis in the liver [ 38 , 39 ] . Likewise growth or death receptors in tumors , which are targeted to trigger apoptosis or at least reduce proliferation in cancer cells [ 61 , 97 ] , induce receptor mediated endocytosis . 124 Chapter 10 Conclusions and Outlook The main objective of the present thesis was the development of a simulation method to efﬁ - ciently track signaling molecules and vesicles through a virtual cell . Brownian / Smoluchowski Dynamics allow omitting the myriads of water solvent molecules and thus enable the model - ing of a whole cell with single molecule detail in the desired molecule species . This approach conserves both the spatial and the stochastic properties of the system . Also the microscopic intracellular properties – a structuring cytoskeleton and further crowding molecules – are in - cluded in order to increase the accuracy and detail of the model . In principle the particle based simulation can be adjusted to any desired spatial and temporal resolution – unhindered of the diffraction limit restricting all microscopic methods . The ac - companying visualization framework developed by Martin Falk [ 77 ] in the joint CSB project 1 enables the interactive exploration of the simulation results . It shows for instance the distribu - tion of the molecules and their motion through the cell [ 78 ] . Within the multitude of cellular structures and proteins of the simulation , the events of interest can be interactively highlighted by focus and context methods , and the path of each molecule can be visualized . Accordingly , this virtual microscope provides detailed images of the modeled cell . It is an invaluable tool to compare simulation results with experimental data , for instance ﬂourescence microscopy images . Before such a simulation can be applied to signal transduction or membrane trafﬁcking mod - els , both principal modules ( i ) transport ( undirected diffusion or directed transport with motor proteins along the cytoskeleton ) and ( ii ) reactions between the molecules have to be cali - brated . Unsurprisingly , a deeper look into the cell with this detailed simulation requires a more detailed look at the parameters that are used . The inﬂuence of the intracellular con - ditions on the mobility and the reaction rate can be comprehensively investigated with the present simulation and reveals that : 1 Center Systems Biology , Universit¨at Stuttgart . 125 10 . CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK i The effective diffusion of tracer molecules is reduced in a size dependent manner . Larger molecules are stronger affected by the cytoskeleton . Rising cytoskeleton con - centrations and ﬁner network meshes lead to a greater hindrance in the diffusion . Also the actual architecture of the cytoskeleton network affects the mobility – cylinders rep - resenting ﬁlaments lead to different results than a porous structure consisting of spher - ical obstacles [ 152 ] . Due to the tortuous way around the obstacles , also subdiffusive behavior can occur , i . e . the averaged square displacement does not rise linearly with time as required for normal diffusion . ii Reactions , in turn , show an ambivalent behavior . On the one hand , the reduced mobil - ity reduces the probability of collisions and subsequent reactions . On the other hand , the reduced free volume due to all the obstacles and structures leads to an increased effective concentration , increasing the collision and reaction rate . The present work quantiﬁes three factors which determine the effective reaction rate , namely ( i ) the ef - fect of the excluded volume , ( ii ) the effect of the reduced mobility , and ( iii ) the effect of the altered accessibility of the molecules . Accordingly it depends on the parameters of the system whether the resulting effective ’in vivo’ reaction rate is higher or lower than the initial ’in vitro’ rate . In addition , the subdiffusive and nonlinear mobility of the molecules can translate into fractal kinetics . iii The complexity is further increased if the different sub - states of a species are explicitly included in the model , for example the fraction of molecules which is unspeciﬁcally and transiently bound to the cytoskeleton and thus at least temporarily immobile . The results have shown , that the reaction rate does not only depend on the fraction of un - bound molecules – i . e . the equilibrium constant of the binding process – but moreover on the actual rate constants of the binding and unbinding reaction . If these rates are increased by the same factor , the equilibrium constant of the binding process will stay the same while the effective reaction rate in other reactions can be altered . This empha - sizes that especially in dynamic models the knowledge of the actual rate constants is of great importance . Models , which do not explicitly contain the detailed microscopic structure , the cellular com - partmentalization , or which even neglect the spatial distances like the commonly used sets of differential equations , have to rest on effective reaction rates which implicitly include the above mentioned effects . Parameter estimation of in vivo dynamics with such models reveals only these effective rates . Nevertheless , models , which are based on ordinary differ - ential equations , are a powerful and predictive tool of the overall dynamic behavior of large metabolic or signaling networks [ 186 , 270 ] . In contrast , the present detailed simulation al - lows a deeper insight on the interactions in the cell . Thus it can be used to bridge the gap 126 between the in vivo and in vitro kinetics . Future work should extend the present method by including the atomic structure as well as the actual reactivities of the different sub - states of the molecules that occur in vivo , for instance by multi - scale modeling methods . It should be noted that the computational efforts restrict the performance of the simulation . If many molecules and interactions are simulated , only a short time span can be covered . The considerable runtime of the simulation also prevents parameter estimations or extensive parameter sweeps . In general , the average of several runs should be taken in order to cancel stochastic effects . In turn , the sampling also reveals the complete distribution of stochastic single events and dynamics like ﬁrst passage times from the plasma membrane towards the nucleus [ 167 , 168 ] . The distribution is a valuable result for the explanation of e . g . differences between the cells of one sample . Methods tracking only the mean value of the system may be computationally faster but cannot return this information . The simulation could be improved by a parallelization of the procedures and the execution on multi - core architectures or supercomputers . Alternatively , many simulations can be con - ducted in parallel on a supercomputer for a rapid and more efﬁcient sampling as well as a fast parameter testing or estimation procedure . This would enable the investigation of interesting effects like parameter dependent regime switches and bistability in signaling in the context of the stochastic and 4D - spatiotemporal environment of the ( virtual ) cell . The present simulation has proved to be a versatile tool that has been applied successfully to the following topics : • Signal transduction : Receptors in the plasma membrane of the cell are activated for example by growth hormones or drugs . This signal has to be transmitted towards the nucleus to trigger the activation of genes . While Kholodenko [ 143 ] predicted that the activated mobile signaling molecules are not able to reach the nucleus due to counter - acting phosphates , the parameters reported by Fujioka et al . [ 89 ] did not lead to this effect in a spatially segregated cell . The difference to the ordinary differential equation model omitting the spatial aspects was negligible . The different results between these models arises from different parameters of the coupled reaction - diffusion process . Kholodenko [ 143 ] suggested that the active signaling molecules need to be transported with motor proteins towards the nucleus . This hypothesis was tested as well , leading to a strongly increased signal in the nucleus . However this effect does not arise from a faster transport but rather from the fact , that the directed motion focuses the molecules onto the nucleus . The surrounding target area is much smaller than the area just next to the plasma membrane where the activation takes place ( the surface grows ∝ r 2 in a sphere ) . This geometric fact leads to the resulting high peri - and subsequently intra - nuclear concentration . 127 10 . CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK Furthermore it could be observed , that the ( spatial ) accumulation in the nucleus can lead to a ( temporal ) modulation of the signal . Slow nucleo - cytoplasmic shuttling can retain the signaling molecules in the nucleus . Thus the cytoplasmic pool of signaling molecules is reduced , which in turn reduces the activation rate of signaling molecules at the plasma membrane . This underscores the necessity to correctly model and know ( i ) the cellular compartments and ( ii ) the respective transport rates – not just the equi - librium value . Future work should especially focus on the spatial organization of the signal in the cell , for example the inﬂuence of scaffolds at the plasma membrane . • Membrane trafﬁcking and receptor mediated endocytosis : In order to model vesicle transport , the agent - based simulation was extended in a multi - scale manner . The agents can not only represent ( signaling ) molecules but also vesicles or compartments which themselves contain a set of cargo and vesicle machinery molecules . The molecules of the corresponding machinery ( coat , SNAREs , and motor proteins [ 66 ] ) have been in - cluded explicitly in the model . This approach enables the comprehensive analysis of the vesicle formation dynamics . Maintenance and recycling of several compounds of the vesicle machinery have been investigated in the present work , revealing that coat molecules need fast binding and unbinding processes between the membrane bound and cytosolic pool while the same process should be slow for motor proteins . The detailed model of vesicle formation is also the basis to model receptor mediated endocytosis , which couples signal transduction and membrane trafﬁcking . The regula - tion of the number of active receptors and also the translocation of receptors into the cell leads to an additional dynamics in the transmitted signal . Vesicle transport between different compartments only works correctly if the vesicles are directed towards their target compartment . This implies considerable constraints on the architecture of the transport network and demands a tight co - localization of the transport pathways and compartment positions with the cytoskeleton structure . The present agent - based simulation was used to identify the principles for a functional trans - port architecture in a process of elimination of nonfunctional setups . The models tested with the simulation method need more reliable input parameters . There - fore , the reaction rates in the temporal domain and transport coefﬁcients in the spatial domain need to be carefully determined from experimental results . The model cytoskeleton of the simulation could likewise be reconstructed from the in vivo cytoskeleton structure based on microscope data ( e . g . by cryoelectron tomography [ 82 , 92 , 200 ] ) . In a further step the simu - lation and visualization framework could be coupled with image analysis techniques , which reconstruct and compare not only static cellular structures but also spatiotemporal protein distributions from microscope data . These distribution can then be used as reference values 128 for parameter estimations in which the simulated molecule distribution is brought into con - gruence with the experimental data . This systems - oriented approach would bring us one step further towards a virtual cell that does not only look like reality but is congruent with it . Especially in the ﬁeld of membrane trafﬁcking , a comprehensive study of the spatiotemporal dynamics of vesicle transport and the interplay with the cytoskeleton is of great importance . So far the literature mostly reports qualitative aspects . The necessary data to reconstruct a functional network in silico is missing . On the way to a congruent model , the kinetic pa - rameters of the vesicle formation , transport , and fusion process have to be identiﬁed . Such a model , which should ideally contain all cellular compartments , would most probably require a dynamic cytoskeleton instead of the static structures in the current simulation – thus adding the need for a reliable description of the spatiotemporal cytoskeleton dynamics as well . Eventually the detailed simulation could be established in a truly bottom - up modeling ap - proach : only the principle forces are included , which then govern the cytoskeleton structure and dynamics , as well as the mobility and interactions of the molecules in the cell . In order to ﬁnally build a complete cell in silico , more and more parameters , molecule species , and inter - actions can be added in a multi - scale model , which employs the optimal simulation method for each process . The key challenge therein will be the bridging of the scales in time and space , combined with a model reduction to keep it tractable and meaningfull . Figure 10 . 1 : In systems - oriented research experimental methods like gene knockout , advanced high throughput analysis techniques , and theoretical modeling approaches are fused together in a fertile alliance to form a holistic understanding of life . Gene knockout / knockdown or silencing techniques [ 81 , 293 ] reveal the function of the respective gene / protein because it is missing . In contrast , the bottom - up construction of a virtual cell requires to ’hack - in’ more and more functions into the system . Often , there are several solutions how a function could be implemented . Biophysical constraints reduce their number , thus revealing not only how it could work but moreover why it actually works the way it does . Linking the modeled solutions with available experimental data improves the model and our knowledge about the functions of life in all spatial and temporal dimensions . 129 130 Appendix A Diffusion , Reactions , and the Step - Length This chapter contains supplementary information on the accuracy of the simulation method . Namely , 1 . Evolution of the particle distribution under diffusion 2 . Modeling the hindered diffusion by obstacles 3 . Artifacts in the simulated effective diffusion 4 .

A . 1 Evolution of the Particle Distribution under Diffusion In order to predict the properties of the diffusion and reaction rates in the simulation it is important to know how the particle distribution of the mobile molecules ( Section 4 . 2 ) will develop within the next step ( s ) of the algorithm ( see Figure A . 1 ) . The following analysis ( i ) justiﬁes the use of a uniform random distribution for the random walk step and ( ii ) shows how the distribution changes from step to step . In this analysis the initial distribution is set to p ( x , t = 0 ) = δ ( x ) . In this case the distribution of many particles equals the probability distribution for the movement of one particle . In one dimension the solution for the unbounded diffusion equation [ 96 ] dp ( x , t ) dt = D ∂ 2 p ( x , t ) ∂x 2 ( A . 1 ) leads to the solution p ( x , t ) = 1 √ 4 πDt exp (cid:32) − 1 2 (cid:18) x √ 2 Dt (cid:19) 2 (cid:33) ( A . 2 ) for the given initial condition . 131 A . DIFFUSION , REACTIONS , AND THE STEP - LENGTH A propagator d can be used to describe the change of the particle distribution from p ( x , t ) to p ( x , t + ∆ t ) [ 53 , 331 ] . If a normal distribution is used in the simulation for the random walk step , the propagator will be : d ( x (cid:48) − x , ∆ t ) = 1 √ 4 πD ∆ t exp (cid:32) − 1 2 (cid:18) x (cid:48) − x √ 2 D ∆ t (cid:19) 2 (cid:33) ( A . 3 ) and the new particle distribution is reached by the convolution p ( x , t + ∆ t ) = (cid:90) x + ∞ x −∞ dx (cid:48) d ( x (cid:48) − x , ∆ t ) p ( x , t ) ( A . 4 ) This indeed leads to the new and wider normal distribution p ( x , t + ∆ t ) = 1 (cid:112) 4 πD ( t + ∆ t ) exp   − 1 2 (cid:32) x (cid:112) 2 D ( t + ∆ t ) (cid:33) 2   ( A . 5 ) A . 1 . 1 Propagation of the Uniform Random Distribution In the present simulation , a uniform step distribution is used in order to speed up and simplify the calculations . The respective propagator is d u ( x (cid:48) − x , ∆ t ) =   0 x (cid:48) − x < − ∆ x 1 2∆ x − ∆ x ≤ x (cid:48) − x < ∆ x 0 ∆ x ≤ x (cid:48) − x ( A . 6 ) Again , the initial conﬁguration is p ( x , t = 0 ) = δ ( x ) , which means that all particles are located at x = 0 . The integral for the convolution towards the distribution after the random walk step can be done stepwise due to the stepwise deﬁnition of d u ( x (cid:48) − x , ∆ t ) . This leads to p ( x , 1∆ t ) =   0 x < − ∆ x (cid:82) x + ∆ x x − ∆ x dx (cid:48) 1 2∆ x δ ( x (cid:48) ) = 1 2∆ x − ∆ x ≤ x < ∆ x 0 ∆ x ≤ x ( A . 7 ) Figure A . 1 shows the comparison for the actual distribution of particles , the distribution given by Equation ( A . 7 ) and the respective normal distribution Equation ( A . 2 ) . In the same way the distribution after the second step can be calculated applying Integra - tion by parts ( the derivative of p ( x , t ) leads to a delta distribution due to the discontinuous function ) : (cid:90) x + ∆ x x − ∆ x dx (cid:48) 1 2∆ xp ( x (cid:48) , 1∆ t ) = (cid:20) x (cid:48) 2∆ xp ( x (cid:48) , 1∆ x ) (cid:21) x + ∆ x x − ∆ x − (cid:90) x + ∆ x x − ∆ x dx (cid:48) x (cid:48) 2∆ x δ ( x (cid:48) + ∆ x ) 2∆ x ( A . 8 ) with the ﬁnal result of the integration : (cid:90) x + ∆ x x − ∆ x dx (cid:48) 1 2∆ xp ( x (cid:48) , 1∆ t ) = (cid:20) x + ∆ x 2∆ x 1 2∆ x − x − ∆ x 2∆ x × 0 (cid:21) − − ∆ x ( 2∆ x ) 2 ( A . 9 ) 132 A . 1 .

The fast conversion occurs according to the central limit theorem . 134 A . 2 . Handling of Collisions in the Simulation A . 2 Modeling the Hindered Diffusion by Obstacles : Handling of Collisions in the Simulation All motion steps can only be executed if the step does not end ( go through ) the excluded volume . In principle , the following three methods can be distinguished : 1 . Reﬂection : The path is reﬂected upon a collision at the surface of the obstacle and continues the remaining path of the step into the new direction . 2 . Retry : Instead of verifying the whole path , only the endpoints are veriﬁed in this ap - proach . If the proposed ﬁnal position is restricted by an obstacle , the full step is rejected and a new step is tried instead until a step with a valid endpoint is found . 3 . Stopping : ( Complete rejection of the step ) : It is much simpler to reset the agent to the previous ( and valid ) position and to wait for the next step than to retry it within the same timestep . All steps that would have ended in an obstacle contribute therefore no displacement to the overall motion of particles . A . 2 . 1 Advantages and Disadvantages of the Collision - Testing Methods Method ( 1 ) using the reﬂection is the most exact method . The random motion of the dif - fusing particles is the outcome of many collisions with the molecules of the medium [ 72 ] . Likewise the obstacles should interact via collisions with the tracer particles . However , the computational efforts are tremendous . Especially the following issues have to be addressed in method ( 1 ) : i Exact computation of the reﬂection : in order to calculate the new path of the agent , ﬁrst the point of the collision within the path has to be found . Then the new direction has to be calculated based on the angle between the path and the surface of the obstacle at the point of the collision . Finally the remaining path has to be added , starting from the point of the collision into the new direction . ii Numerical errors in the calculation : the ﬂoating point arithmetic used in the numer - ical calculations of the reﬂection can introduce problems if the collision occurs at the very beginning or end of the path . As a result the agent can end up slightly within the obstacle . This is an invalid position and will prohibit a reasonable next step of the particle . The handling of these issues demands a complex logic within the calculation of the reﬂection , reducing the performance of the algorithm . iii Multiple reﬂections in crowded media : it is possible that the agent will collide with more than one obstacle . In order to resolve this correctly , the sequence of collisions has to be correct . Therefore one ﬁrst needs to check for all possible collisions , then ﬁnd the ﬁrst collision on the path and update it accordingly . Now the new fraction of the path needs to be checked in the same way until the step is completed . Considering the complexity and the errors of the calculation , this approach is not reasonable . If a small ∆ t and thus a small ∆ x is used and the medium is not too crowded , the probability for multiple collisions within one step will be rather small . In the case of a second collision the agent can be simply stopped at the previous – valid – position in order to avoid these problems . 135 A . DIFFUSION , REACTIONS , AND THE STEP - LENGTH Method ( 2 ) which will reject and retry the step if it ends in an obstacle , is computationally simpler . On the other hand , the accuracy is reduced . The analysis of this method leads to the following remarks : i Inﬁnite loops : In the worst case , one agent does not ﬁnd a valid step , the retry loop will never end and prevents that the simulation continues . Therefore the maximum number of trials within one step should be limited . If the agent was not successfully moved within these trials then it has to stay at the old – valid – position . ii Artiﬁcial force : due to the truncated probability distribution of the steps , the agent will most likely end up further away from the boundary than it was before . This introduces an artiﬁcial force pushing the particle distribution away from the surface of an obstacle . iii Artiﬁcial slowdown : if the hindering structure prohibits steps which have the original average length , only small steps are possible and the mobility of the particles is reduced artiﬁcially . This slowdown is dependent of the timestep ∆ t , since small ∆ t lead to small ∆ x which are less likely to be rejected in a densely crowded medium . iv Jumping over the obstacle : if the steplength is larger than the obstacle , the particle can end up on the other side of the obstacle because only the ﬁnal position but not the path itself is veriﬁed . The step length therefore has to be smaller than the smallest obstacle . Method ( 3 ) is the computationally simplest method . Since the step is not retried , an inﬁnite loop cannot occur . Also , it does not show an artiﬁcial force away from the boundary . This leaves only the issues concerning the accuracy of the method : i Artiﬁcial slowdown : due to the steps that are rejected because they would end in an obstacle . ii Jumping over the obstacle : as described above .

( b ) Correction of the effective diffusion outcome of Method ( 3 ) ( = Stopping ) with the respective stopping probability of Equation ( A . 14 ) . The simulation was performed in the environment of the model cell described in Section 5 . 1 . 136 A . 2 . Handling of Collisions in the Simulation Figure A . 2 a compares the effective diffusion coefﬁcient estimated by the three methods and different ∆ t . Method ( 1 ) calculating the reﬂection is mostly independent of ∆ t , but the ex - cessive computation time cancels this advantage . Method ( 2 ) leads to an artiﬁcial reduction of the effective diffusion if larger step lengths are used . This is due to the fact that in crowded media the repeated sampling selects shorter steps . Method ( 2 ) can only be used if no reac - tions with a surface are included in the model ( because the resulting shifted step - distribution pushes the particles away from the boundary , data not shown ) . Due to the superior stability compared to method ( 3 ) it was used to obtain the effective diffusion coefﬁcients shown in Section 5 . 2 . 1 and published in [ 152 ] . For the more complex simulation including both dif - fusion and reactions however , method ( 3 ) is used . Method ( 3 ) was also used by Trinh et al . [ 305 ] to compute the hindered diffusion in various architectures of porous media . Method ( 3 ) produces the largest deviations of the true D eff / D 0 value . All steps that were rejected lead to a zero displacement and thus artiﬁcially reduce the average displacement . However , it is possible to record the number of rejected steps . The fraction of rejected steps equals the stopping probability P stopping = N rejections N all steps = N rejections N timesteps × N molecules ( A . 13 ) The diffusion is artiﬁcially reduced by this factor . The true effective diffusion should be accordingly : D correctedeff D 0 = D Method ( 3 ) eff D 0 × 1 1 − P stopping ( A . 14 ) The true effective diffusion coefﬁcient should also be independent of the chosen step length . Figure A . 2 b shows that the result of Method ( 3 ) can be corrected accordingly using P stopping . Appendix A . 3 . 3 shows how the stopping probability can also be predicted . Still , the correction of the result does not change the wrong and reduced mobility during the simulation , which can have an effect on diffusion limited reactions . Therefore , the steplength ∆ x should be chosen carefully , considering both the accuracy and the performance of the simulation . In order to improve the performance , Torquato and Kim [ 301 ] have described a method with an adjustable steplength depending on the local properties . This would improve the performance if only one particle is tracked . Since however many particles have to be moved in the same time , all of them having a different distance to the next target , one ﬁxed ’optimal’ steplength has to be used . Methods ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) do not allow an easy prediction and correction of the error in the simu - lated effective diffusion , which limits the validity of the results . Finally , method ( 3 ) is also the best one considering the parallelization of the motion step in the simulation . The same calculations have to be done for every agent , and the calculation does not need to be repeated in case of a rejection of the step . 137 A . DIFFUSION , REACTIONS , AND THE STEP - LENGTH A . 3 Artifacts in the Simulated Effective Diffusion The collision of tracer molecules with obstacles in the cell leads to a reduced effective diffu - sion coefﬁcient . In addition , the implementation of this interaction in the simulation can lead to an artiﬁcial change in the mobility of the molecules . For instance in the method ( iii ) of Section 4 . 2 . 3 and Appendix A . 2 , where steps into an obstacle are rejected and the particle has to wait for the next timestep , the enforced immobility artiﬁcially reduces the diffusion . The overall slowdown is proportional to the fraction of stopped / rejected particles . The following sections aim at quantifying and predicting this effect . A . 3 . 1 Diffusion Through a Regular Lattice of Tubes In order to enable the analytic description of the effective diffusion ( and artifacts ) , a simple periodic tubular structure is taken here as a test model : • Assume a random walk with ﬁxed step length ∆ x = a • The spacing of the periodic tubes is L = ( N + 1 ) × a ( see Figure A . 3a ) . This approach is comparable to the square geometry of Blum et al . [ 28 ] ( Note , that the re - stricted volume has the shape of squares in 2D ) . This periodic lattice structure does not have any dead ends , which ( amongst other properties ) distinguishes it from a random network . Two principal situations can be destingueshed : • particles at intersections – here denoted with the symbol ( + ) : the effective diffusion for these particles will be D ( + ) eff / D 0 = 1 because they do not face any obstacles . • particles within the channels – here denoted with the symbol ( − ) : the effective diffusion for these particles will be D ( − ) eff / D 0 = 1 / dim because the motion is restricted to only one out of the original dim dimensions . Given that all particles are uniformly distributed in the network , the effective diffusion through - out the lattice is obtained by combining the two principal effective diffusion rates D ( + ) eff / D 0 and D ( − ) eff / D 0 , weighted with the respective fractions of intersections and tubes ( see Ta - ble A . 1 ) . So far , the tubes in the network are only lines and have a zero - width , which leads to a free volume fraction of zero . Non - zero widths can also be modeled as shown in Figure A . 3b ( Note the changed deﬁnition of L = N × a ) . With respect to the steplength a the width is deﬁned In 2D In 3D Number of Intersections ( + ) 1 1 Number of Tube - Positions ( - ) 2 × N 3 × N D D 0 ( N ) 2 N 12 + 1 × 1 2 N + 1 = N + 1 2 N + 1 3 N 13 + 1 × 1 3 N + 1 = N + 1 3 N + 1 DD 0 ( lim N → ∞ ) 12 13 Table A . 1 : Calculation of the effective diffusion for the network given in Figure A . 3a . 138 A . 3 . Artifacts in the Simulated Effective Diffusion Figure A . 3 : Setup of the regular lattice of tubes : ( a ) only with zero width ( i . e . lines ) , ( b ) with a ﬁnite width of the channels ( the free volume is shown in green ) . Figure A . 4 : Comparison between the theory of Maxwell and Weissberg ( Equations ( 3 . 10 ) and ( 3 . 11 ) ) [ 325 ] and the prediction from the lattice model multiplied with the free volume ( volume averaging ) . as l = n × a . The fraction of the width to the length is deﬁned as α : = n / N . For simplicity it is still assumed 1 , that the effective diffusion coefﬁcient within the tube is D ( − ) eff / D 0 = 1 / dim . Table A . 2 shows the calculation of the average effective diffusion in this setup . The free volume fraction φ in this network is , φ 2 D = 2 α − α 2 φ 3 D = 3 α 2 − 2 α 3 ( A . 15 ) which allows a comparison with the theory of Maxwell and Weissberg [ 325 ] ( if D / D 0 is multiplied with φ in order to account for the volume averaging – i . e . weight the diffusion in the complete volume , not only in the free volume fraction : i . e . volume averaging [ 328 ] ) . Figure A . 4 shows the comparison , and that the prediction is in good agreement with this classic theory for α < 0 . 15 . The prediction is independent of the step length ∆ x = a . 1 This is only asymptotically correct for l < < L ⇔ n < < N ⇔ α < < 1 . The greater the width of the channel becomes the more inaccurate the assumption D ( − ) eff / D 0 = 1 / dim will be . Also , the diffusion will not drop in a stepwise manner from 1 to 1 / 3 ( in the three - dimensional case ) if a diffusing particle moves away from the intersection into a channel . 139 A .

Collisions with the Wall and Resulting Artifacts Now the collision with the wall shall be included in the model in the 3D prediction . In the area of the intersection particles will not hit a wall ( except in the 8 corner ﬁelds , which is negligible ) . Next to the wall in a channel they will hit the wall with a probability of 1 / 2 ( half of the molecules goes to one side within ∆ t , and the other half to the other side ) . Accordingly the diffusion is reduced by a factor of 1 / 2 ( cf . Equation A . 13 ) . In a corner of the channel only 1 / 4 th of the molecules will not hit the wall . Table A . 3 shows the resulting diffusion rates and the number of lattice sites . The effective diffusion ( now dependent on the step length ) becomes DD 0 ( N , n ) = n 3 + 3 / 3 ( n − 2 ) 2 ( N − n ) + 1 / 6 × 12 ( n − 2 ) ( N − n ) + 12 / 12 ( N − n ) n 3 + 3 ( n − 2 ) 2 ( N − n ) + 12 ( n − 2 ) ( N − n ) + 12 ( N − n ) = N ( n 2 − 2 n + 1 ) + 2 n 2 − n 2 Nn 2 − 2 n 3 ( A . 16 ) For the simulation with L = 99 and l = 1 , a maximum ∆ x of 0 . 15 which leads to ∆ x avg = 0 . 0075 corresponds to n = l / ∆ x avg = 13 . 33 and N = L / ∆ x avg = 1320 . The predicted effective Diffusion due to the stopping at the walls is in this case D D 0 ( N = 1320 , n = 13 . 33 ) = 0 . 288 and the simulation yields D D 0 ( L = 99 , l = 1 ) = 0 . 286 ± 0 . 006 as the average of 10 simulations with 1000 molecules each – which is in complete congruence with the prediction . Figure A . 5 also shows the slow conversion towards the true value for the case L = 99 and l = 1 . 140 A . 3 . Artifacts in the Simulated Effective Diffusion Figure A . 5 : Step - length dependent conversion of the effective diffusion ( Equation A . 16 ) towards the true value in ( a ) linear and ( b ) logarithmic representation . The curve is similar to the results from simulations in Figure A . 2 . Figure A . 6 compares the stochastic simulation with the results of Blum et al . [ 28 ] , showing a good agreement . It also contains the simulation data for method ( ii ) from Section 4 . 2 . 3 ( ’retry’ ) . The respective data points turn out to be slightly above the curve of Blum et al . [ 28 ] . A possible reason could be the asymmetry in the ﬁnal random walk step distribution as indicated in Figure A . 7 . Since the simulation retries the step until a valid new position is found , the eventual step distribution is completely distorted , and an analytic prediction becomes impossible . Also the reﬂection ( method ( i ) from Section 4 . 2 . 3 ) of tracer molecules at an obstacle leads to a changed step distribution , hampering the prediction of the eventual average length ( shorter , but how much ? ) and direction ( depends on the obstacles ? ) . A . 3 . 2 A Short Note on the Emergence of Nonlinear Diffusion The effective diffusion in the area of an intersection in the tubular network is D ( . + . ) eff / D 0 ≈ 1 while it is around D ( − ) eff / D 0 = 1 / 3 within the tubes . The long time effective diffusion coefﬁcient obviously is the average of the diffusion in both fundamentally different regimes , and the transient nonlinearity in the diffusion coefﬁcient might origin from the time that the tracer particles need to travel through several tubes and intersections in order to yield a true average . The network can be in the following two principal setups : ( i ) the network consists mainly of intersections or ( ii ) the network consists mainly of tubes , or in an intermediary structure ( iii ) . In the ﬁrst two cases ( i ) and ( ii ) the transient anomalous diffusion regime seems to be shorter or even not existent compared to the intermediate setup ( see Figure A . 6 ) . A . 3 . 3 The Stopping Probability in an irregular Cytoskeleton In method ( iii ) of Section 4 . 2 . 3 all steps ending in the excluded volume lead to an artiﬁcial slowdown ( Equation A . 13 ) . The corresponding stopping probability can be calculated also in an irregular cytoskeleton . In general , the distribution of the diffusing molecules is homo - geneous . Therefore the fraction of involved molecules is interchangeable with the respective 141 A .

P stopping = number of rejections number of molecules = part of the excluded volume hit by steps free volume ( A . 17 ) The part of the excluded volume (cid:15) that is hit by diffusing steps can be calculated according to Equation ( 4 . 5 ) taking the difference from the excluded volume given by the particle radius and the excluded volume given by the particle radius to which the step length ∆ x is added . This approach assumes , that the curvature of the obstacle surface can be neglected , which is true for small ∆ x . Furthermore the probability to hit the obstacle depends on the propagator of diffusion in the random walk model ( see Section A . 1 ) . In order to calculate the stopping probability , the step ∆ x has to be split into N slices . The probability that the step length yields ∆ x × i / N is for the uniform random walk step p ( i ) = 0 . 5 × ( N − i ) / N . Summing up the sub - volumes and the corresponding stopping probability leads to the desired number : P stopping = N (cid:88) i = 1 (cid:15) ( r collision + ∆ x × i / N ) − (cid:15) ( r collision + ∆ x × ( i − 1 ) / N ) φ ( r collision ) × 1 2 ( N − i ) N ( A . 18 ) 142 A . 4 .

DIFFUSION , REACTIONS , AND THE STEP - LENGTH A . 5 Reactions and the Time Step ∆ t This section focuses on the inﬂuence of the time step on the apparent reaction rate of the sim - ulation and shows the similarity between the present method and the Fokker - Planck equation . This section extends the discussion of Section 4 . 3 . 2 in the main text . A . 5 . 1 Reﬁlling of the Reaction Volume As explained in Section 4 . 3 - 4 . 4 the reaction rate constant k is translated into a reaction volume k × ∆ t . Molecules that are within the designated reaction volume will react . A prerequisite in this approach is , that the concentration in the reaction volume equals the local concentration of molecules . Accordingly , the reaction volume has to be reﬁlled up to the local particle density in every step in order to yield the correct reaction rate . The following sections investigate how well this prerequisite is fulﬁlled . Reﬁlling of the Reaction Volume At a Surface Figure A . 9 shows how the boundary and the corresponding reaction volume deform the particle distribution under the given propagator of the uniform random walk step ( cf . Ap - pendix A . 1 ) . Obviously the reaction volume is only ( re - ) ﬁlled to half of the local particle density ( or a little bit less , if the slope of the distribution is taken into account – however h s (cid:28) ∆ x in the given framework 2 ) . In order to correct this error 1 . The simulation could evaluate reactions based on a reaction volume with twice the height above the surface h s , corrected = 2 × h s = 2 × k × ∆ t . The factor of two will then outbalance the missing particle density . This approach was used e . g . to obtain the diffusion limited adsorption to the plasma membrane rates shown in Figure 5 . 10 . 2 . The reactions can be evaluated using ∆ t reaction = n ∆ t motion , this means , that between the reactions n diffusion steps occur during which the reaction volume is reﬁlled . The particle density in the reaction volume is then approximately c ( n ) c 0 = n (cid:88) i = 1 (cid:18) 1 2 (cid:19) i ( A . 19 ) ( the difference between the density in the reaction volume and the correct local density c 0 is reduced by half in each step ) . Accordingly the reaction volume is reﬁlled to 97 % after n = 5 diffusion steps and to 99 . 9 % after n = 10 diffusion steps . In the latter case , no correction factor is necessary because the reaction volume is correctly reﬁlled . The particle distribution can adapt to the boundary condition within ∆ t reaction . The simulation indeed returns the expected reaction rate . Of course the local consumption of molecules has to be balanced by the ﬂux from the unaf - fected areas into the reaction volume . This ﬂux is diffusion controlled , which translates into a diffusion - controlled reaction ( cf . Figure 5 . 10 ) . 2 Especially , if h s > ∆ x , the molecules have no chance to reﬁll the whole reaction volume in one time step . 144 A . 5 . Reactions and the Time Step ∆ t Figure A . 9 : ( i ) Ideally the reaction volume with width h s ( ’height’ above the respective sur - face ) should be ( re - ) ﬁlled in each timestep to the local average particle concentration c 0 . . . ( ii ) so that the number of molecules ∆ N which react within [ t , t + ∆ t ) corresponds to the ’height’ of the reaction layer h s . ( iii ) However , the chosen uniform random walk step leads to a triangular particle distribution . ( iv ) In addition , the rejection of steps jump - ing into the restricted volume furthermore de - forms the particle distribution – the respective particles remain at their old position . It can be assumed that h s (cid:28) ∆ x ( the reac - tion layer is much smaller than the maximal step length ) , so that the average particle con - centration within the reaction volume is ap - proximately half of the local particle density . Accordingly the number of molecules which react within [ t , t + ∆ t ) will only match 1 / 2 h s . Note , that also using a normal distribution the same result would be obtained – a sigmoidal shape will evolve instead of the linear front . Reﬁlling of the Reaction Volume At a Filament Cytoskeleton ﬁlaments are represented by cylinders , which are accordingly surrounded by a reaction volume . The reaction area perpendicular to the ﬁber direction has to be multiplied with the length of the ﬁber to obtain the reaction volume . However , parts of the reaction volume are not accessible for overlapping cylinders as shown in Figure A . 10 ) . Again , the re - ﬁlling of the reaction volume can be calculated based on the random walk propagator / distribution of Appendix A . 1 . This becomes much more complicated in the two - dimensional case compared to the previous section 3 . Due to this complexity it is highly recommended not to use a correction factor but to sample only every N ≥ 5 random walk step for a cytoskeleton - particle interaction in order to allow the relaxation of the particle distribution as outlined above ( Equation A . 19 ) . The binding rate achieved in the present simulation is in agreement with the prediction of differential equations – if the available binding volume is correctly estimated as indicated in Figure A . 10 ) . Reﬁlling of the Reaction Volume Between Interacting Molecules Reactions between mobile molecules of the simulation which can overlap are evaluated based on the reaction probability P reactionij + Diff . Accordingly , the local particle density is only reduced but not set to zero within the interaction radius . Furthermore it is re - ﬁlled from all sides 3 Still , a correction factor for the critical reaction distance can be calculated in order to outbalance the incom - plete reﬁlling similarly to the correction factor for reactions at surfaces . Due to the nonlinear dependency , the correct factor has to be obtained in an iterative way . 145 A . DIFFUSION , REACTIONS , AND THE STEP - LENGTH Figure A . 10 : Truly accessible inter - action volume for randomly overlap - ping cylinders : The binding / reaction rate is determined by the reaction rate constant times the ﬁber concen - tration . Due to the randomly overlap - ping setup of the cytoskeleton ﬁbers , the effective length of the ﬁbers and the resulting non - restricted reaction volume can be calculated either us - ing a Monte - Carlo volume sampling method or based on the equations for the excluded volume of ran - domly overlapping obstacles of Sec - tion 4 . 1 . 2 . Since the reaction volume is much smaller than the ﬁber vol - ume , it is much less affected by the self - overlapping effects . around the spherical molecules , which leads to a nearly perfectly re - ﬁlled reaction volume within each step . Figuratively ( in the description of Figure A . 9 ) , half of the reaction volume is re - ﬁlled from the left , and half from the right if the step - length is larger than the ( combined ) interaction radius of both reactants ( in 3D : it is 1 / 6th each from the 6 sides : top , bottom , right , left , front , and back ) . The simulated reaction rate was in agreement with the predicted reaction rate from macro - scopic models without the need to specify a further correction factor . 146 A . 5 . Reactions and the Time Step ∆ t A . 5 . 2 Numerical Solution of the Fokker - Planck Equation in 1D The Fokker - Planck equation introduced in Figure 3 . 5 can be solved numerically in the one - dimensional setup which corresponds to the binding reaction of molecules to a ( planar ) sur - face ( cf . Section 4 . 4 . 1 ) . The Fokker - Planck equation reads ∂W ( x , t ) ∂t = D ∂ 2 W ( x , t ) ∂x 2 ; W ( x , t = 0 ) = W start ( A . 20 ) The boundary condition for the partially reﬂecting , partially reactive surface is : ± D ∂W ( x , t ) ∂x (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) x = 0 , L = k (cid:48) W ( x , t ) | x = 0 , L ( A . 21 ) where the + corresponds to the right boundary at x = 0 and the − to the left at x = L . The numerical solution requires the discretization as shown in Figure A . 11 . The discretization of Equation A . 20 is accordingly : (cid:90) x i + 1 x i ∂ ∂tW i ( t ) dx = (cid:90) x i + 1 x i D ∂ 2 ∂x 2 W i ( t ) dx ∂ ∂tW i ( t ) V i = D ∂ ∂xW i ( t ) (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) x i + 1 x i ( A . 22 ) W i ( t + ∆ t ) − W i ( t ) ∆ t V i = D W i + 1 ( t ) − W i ( t ) ∆ x − D W i ( t ) − W i − 1 ( t ) ∆ x W i ( t + ∆ t ) = W i ( t ) + ∆ t V i D W i + 1 ( t ) − W i ( t ) ∆ x − ∆ t V i D W i ( t ) − W i − 1 ( t ) ∆ x The boundary condition has to be discretized as well , leading to D W i ( t ) − W i − 1 ( t ) ∆ x = k (cid:48) W i ( t ) ( A . 23 ) on the left ( i = 0 ) and D W i + 1 ( t ) − W i ( t ) ∆ x = − k (cid:48) W i ( t ) ( A . 24 ) on the right ( i = n ) . Equation ( A . 23 ) and ( A . 23 ) replace the respective terms in Equa - tion ( A . 22 ) for i = 0 and i = N . These ﬂuxes determine the number of reactions within Figure A . 11 : Discretization of the probability density function W ( x , t ) of the Fokker - Planck equation in 1D . 147 A . DIFFUSION , REACTIONS , AND THE STEP - LENGTH ( t , t + ∆ t ] . At either side , the ﬂux is : k (cid:48) W i ( t ) ∆ t V i ( A . 25 ) ( for i = 0 and i = N respectively ) . The total number of reactions within ( t , t + ∆ t ] . is given by taking the integral , or in this discretized case by multiplying with the volume V i . This leads to ∆ N = k (cid:48) W i ( t ) ∆ t V i × V i = k (cid:48) ∆ t × W i ( A . 26 ) Comparison with the Reaction Distance of the Particle Tracking Method Note , that the factor ( k (cid:48) ∆ t ) is similar to the factor of the present method to evaluate the number of reactions . In the present method , the boundary condition is completely reﬂecting ( cf . Section 4 . 4 . 1 ) : D ∂W ( x , t ) ∂x (cid:12)(cid:12) (cid:12)(cid:12) x = 0 , L = 0 ( A . 27 ) which means no ﬂux across the border . The number of reactions is determined by the size of the reaction volume and the local particle density ( = probability density function ) W i . This leads to ∆ N = ( k (cid:48) ∆ t ) × W i ( A . 28 ) and equals Equation ( A . 26 ) . The initial Fokker - Planck setup determines the ﬂux as a ﬂux , while the present framework treats k (cid:48) ∆ t as the size of a reaction volume , in which all molecules will react . In the given discretization , both methods lead to the same number of reactions within ( t , t + ∆ t ] . Therefore , both methods are equal , at least from the perspective of the numerical solution . Based on these ﬁndings I dare to state that the present simulation framework is a Monte - Carlo method to solve the given Fokker - Planck equation . It is valid , as long as it is able to reﬁll the reaction volume k (cid:48) ∆ t to the local density W 0 , which was discussed above . The fol - lowing section shows how the 1D solution is related to the situation in 3D and explains that these ﬁndings are also valid in 3D . A . 5 . 3 From 1D to 3D In 3D , the reaction volume k ∆ t has to be wrapped around the sphere . Equation ( 4 . 25 ) , which states the reaction distance for surface reactions , can be derived from Equation ( 4 . 26 ) , stating the critical distance for reactions between non - overlapping molecules if r j (cid:29) r i and ( r i + r j ) (cid:29) k si ∆ t ( and thus negligible curvature compared to the reaction distance ) using the series expansion of 3 √ 1 + x ≈ 1 + 1 / 3 x [ 35 ] : r ij ( k ) ≈ ( r i + r j ) (cid:18) 1 + k ij ∆ t 4 π 1 ( r i + r j ) 3 (cid:19) ( A . 29 ) The interaction surface around one spherical molecule is given by s = 4 π ( r i + r j ) 2 , the total surface of all reacting molecules is S = s × n . The corresponding surface concentration 148 A . 5 . Reactions and the Time Step ∆ t is c s = S / V olume = s × n / V olume . The concentration of molecules with surface s is thus simply c j = n / V olume , the corresponding reaction constant k ij = k si × s ( index i corresponds to the undbound molecules , index j to the objects with surface s ) . Using this gives : r ij ( k ) ≈ ( r i + r j ) + k si × s ∆ t s = ( r i + r j ) + k s ∆ t = x coll + h s ( k ) ( A . 30 ) and thus Equation ( 4 . 25 ) . A . 5 . 4 Competing Reactions All reactions of a complex interaction network occur simultaneously . In the simulation how - ever , they can only be evaluated sequentially , one after the other 4 . As such the ﬁrst evaluated reaction which consumes molecules of a given species reduces the level of that species so that the reaction rate in the following reactions is evaluated based on a lower molecule number . In turn , a reaction which produces the given molecules increases the number of molecules which contribute to the next reaction . Furthermore the fact of increased backward reactions in case of reversible reactions has to be considered . Since the pair of molecules created in a dissociation process is placed overlap - ping , it will directly associate with the probability P reactionij + Diff if the corresponding bimolecular association reaction is evaluated after the dissociation reaction ( cf . Section 4 . 3 . 2 ) . The following implementation was chosen in the present simulation in order to obtain correct reaction rates in a complex network : • Bimolecular reactions are evaluated before the monomolecular ( dissociation ) reactions in order to prevent a direct re - association of the molecules 5 . Therefore the dissociation reaction is separated from the possible re - association by a diffusion step which leads to a sufﬁcient distance between the molecules . The resulting error in the reaction rates due to the fact that the bimolecular reactions are always evaluated ﬁrst decreases with ∆ t and is much smaller than the error coming from an immediate re - association with probability P reactionij + Diff . • Monomolecular ( ﬁrst order ) reactions are evaluated in a random order , so that they are – on average – processed simultaneously . • Bimolecular reactions are always evaluated in the same order . The probability that two competing reactants are close enough to the same molecule is negligible in the given diluted setup . ( Nevertheless , the order of the bimolecular reactions could likewise be randomized in order to increase the accuracy in more complex reaction networks . ) • Reactions in the Gillespie framework are evaluated only after the reactions with obsta - cles like the plasma membrane or the nucleus have been processed in order to prevent a re - binding of newly created molecules to these objects . The Gillespie algorithm itself draws the time and type of the next reaction based on the current state which in itself ensures that all reactions are evaluated simultaneously . 4 If the reactions are evaluated in parallel processes on a multicore CPU or supercomputer cluster , the case that one molecule is simultaneously consumed by two different reactions has to be prohibited , although it might occur in a stochastic simulation with a certain probability . 5 Interactions with the plasma membrane , the cytoskeleton , or the nucleus are bimolecular reactions as well . 149 A . DIFFUSION , REACTIONS , AND THE STEP - LENGTH Future work will have to explore better ways to incorporate a correct treatment of reversible reactions ( i ) without the need to displace one of the two products of the dissociation ( which leads to an artiﬁcially increased mobility and can be impossible in highly crowded structures ) , and ( ii ) allowing a truly random order in the evaluation of all reactions so that no reaction is artiﬁcially in favor . The parallelization of the reactions likewise requires a careful evaluation because a molecule at the border between two threads could react at the same time with two different molecules ( one from the left and one from the right thread ) – and everything that can happen in a Monte Carlo simulation will happen sooner or later . A . 5 . 5 Optimization of the Performance of the Reaction Framework This event based framework requires to check all inter - particle distances for a possible bi - molecular reaction . Appendix B shows how this can be efﬁciently restricted to the neighbor - ing agents in order to improve the performance . All positions of agents of the ﬁrst species in the reaction have to be compared with all positions of the ( surrounding ) agents of the second species . This requires a loop within a loop . Ideally , the outer loop should be the small one with the smaller number of molecules so that less inner loops have to be initiated . Accord - ingly the molecule species which has on average the smaller number should be stated as the ﬁrst species of the pair of educts in the parameter input ﬁle . If however one molecule is destroyed in the reaction ( e . g . A + B → A ) , the remaining molec - ular species should be stated as the ﬁrst species . If the reaction is stated as A + B → A , the ﬁrst agent ( formerly B ) will become of kind A in this reaction , and the second agent will be destroyed . In general the positions of both agents will not have been identical , which leads to a displacement for the surviving molecule ( it hopped from the position of the second agent to the position of the ﬁrst agent in the reaction ) . This displacement could affect the effective diffusion of the species and thus the reaction rate in a diffusion limited reaction . 150 Appendix B Computational Issues : Grids , Scaling , and Performance The interactions between the agents of the simulation require to check the distances of all agent - pairs as well as the distances of the agents to all cytoskeleton / crowding objects . The collision / reaction interaction is a short range interaction , so it is sufﬁcient to only check the local neighbors . Since the agents are moving randomly through the cell , the neighbors are constantly changing . Therefore a grid - system is introduced which allows the listing of the current neighboring agents ( see Figure B . 1 ) . B . 1 Grid and Particle Listing The user can deﬁne the spacing of the grid . In the three - dimensional space the grid then deﬁnes small cubic boxes . Boxes of the grid that are completely outside of the spherical cell are deleted from the list of boxes in order to achieve a compact usage of the memory . The moving agents are assigned to the box in which they are located after every move 1 . The number of agents of each species in the box is constantly updated . In order to access the respective agents e . g . for reactions , a linked list is used . This list is likewise updated if an agent changes the box after a moving step or a reaction that changed the type of the agent . It can happen , that two agents that can react with each other are close together , but just across the border of the grid . Therefore , when testing for reactions , not only the agents of the own box but also of the neighboring boxes have to be tested . B . 1 . 1 Cytoskeleton List In contrast to the mobile agents in the simulation , the cytoskeleton is static . Therefore it is sufﬁcient , to create a static cytoskeleton list at the beginning . Due to the static structure of 1 Scaling of the Cell : For a simpler sorting of the agents into the boxes of the grid , the length of each box is 1 in the simulation . The size of the cell , compartments , objects and interactions is adjusted accordingly by the respective scaling factor m = size of the grid size of the cell = L grid 2 R cell ( B . 1 ) The coordinates of the box are found by simply taking the integer of the current position and discarding the decimal places using the int ( ) - function ( note , that the model cell is setup in a way so that only positive positions are possible ) . Diffusion and reaction rate constants have to be scaled according to their units as well . 151 B . COMPUTATIONAL ISSUES : GRIDS , SCALING , AND PERFORMANCE Figure B . 1 : One layer of the model cell used in Chapter 5 . The cell is distributed into a grid of 40 × 40 × 40 boxes . Out of the total 64000 boxes only the 44936 boxes which are not outside the sphere are used in the simulation . All boxes contain a static list with the cytoskeleton structures and crowding spheres that they contain . In the given cell up to 49 structures are inside one of the boxes . The spacing of the grid should be adjusted so that only a reasonable number of cytoskeleton structures and mobile , interacting molecules is located within a box . Thus the number of pairs that have to be checked for an interaction ( collision , reaction ) can be reduced and the performance of the simulation becomes better . 152 B . 1 . Grid and Particle Listing that list , it is not necessary to have a linked list . The simulation simply contains one array with the number of cytoskeleton elements in every box . A second array contains the index of the respective structures . The size of this array can be limited to the maximum number of cytoskeleton elements in a box . B . 1 . 2 List of Cell - Structure - Parameters The following parameters are sufﬁcient to describe the properties of the static structures : • number of static structure types • number of structures / agents of each type • size ( radius ) and in case of ﬁlaments also the length L S of the cylinder • a logical parameter which deﬁnes whether the structure is a sphere or a cylinder • a logical parameter which deﬁnes whether the inside or the outside of the structure is the excluded volume The individual crowding agents carry only the following information : • the type of the agent • the position ( center ) (cid:126)x , and in case of cylinders the normalized direction (cid:126)s ( normalized ) . Note that the calculation of the collision with a cylinder is much faster if the position of the mobile agent along the ﬁlament is checked with the symmetric formula | λ ∗ | < L S / 2 than 0 < λ ∗ < L S . The nucleus is positioned along the x - axes in the cell . A shift of 0 . 0 means the central position , and a shift of 1 . 0 moves the nucleus as far as possible towards the plasma membrane in the plus x direction . Since this is the ﬁrst symmetry breaking step of the simulation , no shift in the y - and z - direction is needed . All further compartments and structures , however , have to be arranged with respect to the nuclear position . Additional parameters describe the appearance of the structures in the visualization , and the architecture and polarization of the cytoskeleton setup . For a more detailed cytoskeleton it might be necessary to add an individual length L ( i ) S for each ﬁlament . B . 1 . 3 Sorting and Computation Time With respect to an efﬁcient calculation of the agent motion step as well as the testing for bimolecular reactions the agents should be processed in a reasonable order . This means that the array (cid:126)x i where the subscript i denotes the agent i should contain the agents in the ﬁrst grid - cell ﬁrst , then the agents in the second grid - cell and so on . Due to the random motion this order diffuses away as well . In order to maintain the order in (cid:126)x i the array has to be resorted after a given interval . Since the sorting procedure itself also requires computation time , (cid:126)x i should not be resorted too frequently . The sorting interval has to be set manually by the user in order to yield an optimal performance . 153 B . COMPUTATIONAL ISSUES : GRIDS , SCALING , AND PERFORMANCE 154 Appendix C Visualization With Povray Along with the simulation also a basic visualization framework was developed employing the Persistence of Vision Raytracer ( POV - Ray ) 1 . By tracing the rays from a virtual light source to a virtual camera in a virtual scene ( or the other way round for technical purposes ) an image of the virtual scene is rendered . At user determined time intervals the current position of the molecules in the virtual cell is written into a POV - Ray input ﬁle . At the beginning also the cytoskeleton structure is translated into a POV - Ray input ﬁle . These scene ﬁles are then converted into an image using POV - Ray . Using further software tools also a video can be produced out of the series of images . The development of this visualization version heavily relied on the excellent POV - Ray on - line tutorial of Friedrich A . Lohm ¨ uller 2 . C . 1 Comments on Using Constructive Solid Geometry Constructive solid geometry ( CSD ) allows for instance to create the intersection of two ob - jects . This is particularly helpful to cut off cytoskeleton ﬁlament cylinders that would extend across the plasma membrane of the cell or to show sections of the cell . However the POV - Ray CSD method tests all elements of one object ( e . g . the cytoskeleton ) for the given intersection even if they are completely outside of the overlapping area . This leads to a tremendous slow - down of the image rendering . Therefor the cytoskeleton ﬁlaments are cropped already when they are written to the POV - Ray input ﬁle in the FORTRAN simulation environment . Like - wise the molecules should be either manually or automatically sorted into the three groups that are ( i ) completely inside the intersection , ( ii ) completely outside of the intersection , and ( iii ) those that have to be checked with CSD . C . 1 . 1 Checking for Unintended Collisions in the Simulation CSD is also helpful in order to detect unintended collisions in the simulation . Overlapping objects are simply found in the POV - Ray image , because only the overlapping parts remain as intersection . If the simulation works correctly , the null set will remain and no object is found in the image . 1 POV - Ray was also used by [ 228 ] to visualize cellular structures . 2 http : / / www . f - lohmueller . de 155 C . VISUALIZATION WITH POVRAY C . 2 Advantages and Disadvantages of the POV - Ray Visual - ization The specialized visualization framework developed by Martin Falk [ 77 , 78 ] is much faster than POV - Ray in creating the images and also allows to interactively explore the cell both in the spatial and temporal domain . It is also able to handle ( nearly ) any given number of molecules and cytoskeleton ﬁlaments , while POV - Ray is overstrained ( out of memory ) with extreme particle numbers . Still , the presented POV - Ray visualization framework has the following advantages : • New visualization ideas can be easily introduced / tested . The objects just have to be included into the scene description ﬁles without the need to develop a ﬁtting routine in the visualization software . For example the cytoskeleton color map showing the polarization of the ﬁlaments was included in the cytoskeleton object description . The idea to show the directionality based on a color map was developed by Martin Falk [ 77 ] . Likewise the objects can be easily re - organized in order to test for unintended collisions as outlined in the previous section . • New objects can be introduced as well . This holds especially for vesicles , which all can have a different size , color , etc . • The camera and cell location / orientation are speciﬁed in the scene ﬁle as well . This allows to compare several different cell setups from the same viewing angle ( cf . Fig - ure 8 . 9 b ) . 156 Appendix D Simulation Data and Models D . 1 Simulation Data and Results of Chapter 4 D . 1 . 1 Hindered Diffusion by Mobile Crowding Spheres The ’standard’ simulation does only provide immobile , static crowding objects ( cf . Sec - tion 4 . 2 . 3 ) . For a more realistic environment also the principal setup of mobile crowding agents was tested . It is worth noting , that in this case the crowding molecules reduce the motion of the tracer molecules while the tracer molecules affect the motion of the crowding molecules . Test Setup As outlined above the interaction between the mobile agents makes it impossible to distin - guish between tracer and crowding molecules . In the present setup therefore only one species of test spheres is used . • Initial position : 1000 equal test spheres are arranged in a regular 10 × 10 × 10 grid inside of a cubic test volume . • Excluded volume : the excluded volume is given by the collision volume and the num - ber of spheres because they must not overlap . Obviously the size of the spheres cannot exceed the spacing of the grid because they would start to overlap . The size of the test spheres is adjusted so that they occupy the desired volume fraction . • Diffusion and collisions : The spheres move in every timestep which ﬁnally leads to a random distribution . Periodic boundary conditions are used in order to avoid ﬁnite size effects ( cf . Section 4 . 2 . 3 , Figure 4 . 3 ) . Two different collision methods have been tested , namely ’Stopping’ ( i . e . Method ( 3 ) and ’Retry’ ( i . e . Method ( 2 ) ) as described in Section 4 . 2 . 3 and evaluated in Appendix A . 2 . • Evaluation of the effective diffusion : The effective diffusion was evaluated as de - scribed in Section 4 . 2 . 3 based on the average of 7 runs with the aforementioned 1000 particles each . 157 D . SIMULATION DATA AND MODELS Results Figure D . 1 shows the declining effective diffusion coefﬁcient with increasing test sphere radii . The spheres themselves hinder their mobility . This can also be described as an increased effective viscosity of the soltion . The increased viscosity of a solution of interacting hard spheres is [ 93 ] η / η 0 = 1 + k E σ + k H σ 2 ( D . 1 ) with k E = 2 . 5 and k H = 6 . 0 for hard spheres [ 93 ] . σ is the volume fraction of the spheres . This formula only holds for small crowding concentrations . The effective diffusion is then D / D 0 = η 0 / η according to the Stokes - Einstein - relation . The result of the simulation is in good agreement with the prediction for small crowding concentrations , and also in agreement with the results of [ 296 ] . Figure D . 1 : Concentration dependent diffu - sion coefﬁcient of interacting hard spheres : Comparison of simulation results ( two differ - ent simulation methods , see text ) with the prediction based on Equation ( D . 1 ) assuming that D / D 0 = η 0 / η according to the Stokes - Einstein - relation . The interacting test particles hinder themselves in their mobility . This hin - drance rises with the volume fraction of the test spheres . The graph shows the average and standard deviation of 7 runs with 1000 parti - cles each . 158 D . 2 . Simulation Data and Results of Chapter 5 D . 2 Simulation Data and Results of Chapter 5 D . 2 . 1 ’in vitro’ Reaction Rate in the Test Model This section compares the results of the agent - based simulation with the ODE model for the small reaction network introduced in Section 5 . 3 . 1 . Model Description and Parameter : • The zero order reaction r 1 is modeled as a ﬁrst order reaction D → D + S based on a dummy molecule D with c D = 1 × 10 − 7 mol / l ( 10300 molecules ) as described in Section 4 . 4 . 4 ( see Equation ( 4 . 32 ) ) the ﬁrst order rate constant for the simulation is accord - ingly k (cid:48) 1 = k 1 / c D . • c E is set to 2 × 10 − 7 mol / l ( 20600 molecules ) . • The steady state c ∗ S = k 1 / ( k 2 c E ) due to the ’in vitro’ reaction rate for both the ODE a ( Equation ( 5 . 6 ) ) and simulated molecule numbers is as follows : a ODE = Ordinary Differential Equation ( s ) Resulting Steady State Number of S Molecules and Deviation from the ODE Model β k 1 k 2 N ODE − Model S N Sim .

SIMULATION DATA AND MODELS ( cf . Section 2 . 5 and 4 . 3 . 1 , [ 58 , 252 , 280 , 300 ] ) . k D is accordingly calculated based on the collision distance and the combined diffusion coefﬁcient of the reactants . For a given macroscopic reaction rate , the microscopic reaction rate constant is accordingly ( given that the user does not try to exceed the diffusion limit with the macroscopic reaction rate , i . e . k macro < k D ) : k micro = k D × k macro k D − k macro ( D . 4 ) Now we are interested in the effective macroscopic reaction rate constant , given that the microscopic reaction rate constant is held constant but the diffusion is reduced in the crowded intracellular conditions . This leads to a reduced k D , eff = 4 π ( r i + r j ) ( D i , eff + D j , eff ) ( D . 5 ) and the effective macroscopic reaction rate can now be caluclated based on Equation ( D . 2 ) k macro , eff = k D , eff × k micro k D , eff + k micro ( D . 6 ) Inserting Equation ( D . 4 ) into Equation ( D . 6 ) leads to k macro , eff = k D , eff × (cid:16) k D × k macro k D − k macro (cid:17) k D , eff + (cid:16) k D × k macro k D − k macro (cid:17) ( D . 7 ) If also the deﬁnition of k D and k D , eff are inserted , this becomes k macro , eff = k D × k ( 0 ) 2 k D + k ( 0 ) 2 (cid:18) D ( 0 ) i + D ( 0 ) j D effi + D effj − 1 (cid:19) ( D . 8 ) The initial ( unperturbed ) macroscopic reaction rate can be set into relation with the diffusion limit , deﬁning β : = k macro / k D ( D . 9 ) which leads to a simpliﬁcation of Equation ( D . 8 ) k macro , eff = k D × β 1 + β (cid:18) D ( 0 ) i + D ( 0 ) j D effi + D effj − 1 (cid:19) = k macro × 1 1 + β (cid:18) D ( 0 ) i + D ( 0 ) j D effi + D effj − 1 (cid:19) ( D . 10 ) From this equation it can be deduced , that the effective macroscopic reaction rate constant is reduced by the factor f diff = 1 1 + β (cid:18) D ( 0 ) i + D ( 0 ) j D effi + D effj − 1 (cid:19) ( D . 11 ) This factor is then used in Section 5 . 3 . 2 to describe the resulting change in the reaction rate due to the reduced diffusion . 160 D . 2 . Simulation Data and Results of Chapter 5 D . 2 . 3 Transient Binding and Reactions The model describing the creation and consumption of S molecules is now extended by un - speciﬁc binding reactions . Section 5 . 3 . 3 contains the results if both S and E are subject to the transient binding effect . The following sections extend this study and contribute the analytic derivation of the steady state concentrations . Only S is transiently bound Figure D . 2 shows the corresponding setup : S is subject to transient binding , splitting it into the free sub - species S 1 and the bound sub - species S 2 , while E is always unbound . This setup splits the rate r 2 = k 2 c S c E into two different reaction rates r 2 , 1 and r 2 , 2 . The new rates follow the same kinetics but with an effective rate constant due to the altered mobility of the bound state . The corresponding balance equations are dc S 1 dt = r 1 , 1 − r 2 , 1 − r 3 , 1 + r 3 , 2 = 0 and dc S 2 dt = r 1 , 2 − r 2 , 2 + r 3 , 1 − r 3 , 2 = 0 ( D . 12 ) For an easier , dimensionless comparison , the following relative reaction rates are introduced : α = k 1 / ( k D c E ) ; β = k 2 / k D ; γ = k 3 / ( k D c E ) ( D . 13 ) Using these relative rates the reference steady state concentration ( Equation ( 5 . 6 ) ) becomes c ∗ S = α / β . The steady state concentrations of the sub - species S 1 , S 2 and the total S molecules in this setup ( 2 . ( a ) ) are calculated in the following way : ( setting r 1 , 1 = r 2 , 1 = r 1 = k 1 ) . Summing up both equations leads to 2 r 1 − r 2 , 1 − r 2 , 2 = 0 ( D . 14 ) while subtracting leads to − r 2 , 1 + r 2 , 2 − 2 r 3 , 1 + 2 r 3 , 2 = 0 ( D . 15 ) Figure D . 2 : Model setup and results : S is subject to transient binding while E is not . The lines show the model given in Equation ( D . 23 ) and the symbols the outcome of the respective simulations . 161 D . SIMULATION DATA AND MODELS Inserting the actual deﬁnitions of the rates leads to 2 k 1 − c S 1 c E k eff 2 ( k 2 , D S = 1 , D E = 1 ) − c S 2 c E k eff 2 ( k 2 , D S = 0 , D E = 1 ) = 0 − c S 1 c E k eff 2 ( k 2 , D S = 1 , D E = 1 ) + c S 2 c E k eff 2 ( k 2 , D S = 0 , D E = 1 ) + 2 k 3 ( c S 2 − c S 1 ) = 0 ( D . 16 ) Using Equation ( D . 10 ) as well as the deﬁnitions of Equation ( D . 13 ) gives : 2 k 1 − c S 1 ( c E k D ) β − c S 2 ( c E k D ) β (cid:16) 1 1 + β (cid:17) = 0 − c S 1 ( c E k D ) β − c S 2 ( c E k D ) β (cid:16) 1 1 + β (cid:17) + 2 k 3 ( c S 2 − c S 1 ) = 0 ( D . 17 ) and further 2 α − c S 1 β − c S 2 β (cid:16) 1 1 + β (cid:17) = 0 − c S 1 β − c S 2 β (cid:16) 1 1 + β (cid:17) + 2 γ ( c S 2 − c S 1 ) = 0 ( D . 18 ) From the ﬁrst equation c S 1 can be deduced c S 1 β = 2 α / β − c S 2 (cid:18) 1 1 + β (cid:19) ( D . 19 ) and inserted into the second equation : − β (cid:18) 2 α / β − c S 2 (cid:18) 1 1 + β (cid:19)(cid:19) − c S 2 β (cid:18) 1 1 + β (cid:19) + 2 γ (cid:18) c S 2 − (cid:18) 2 α / β − c S 2 (cid:18) 1 1 + β (cid:19)(cid:19)(cid:19) = 0 ( D . 20 ) This simpliﬁes to c S 2 = 2 α 2 β × ( 2 γ + β ) ( 1 + β ) β + 2 γ + βγ = c ∗ S × β + 2 βγ + 2 γ + β 2 β + 2 γ + βγ ( D . 21 ) Inserting this result back into Equation ( D . 20 ) leads to c S 1 = 2 α 2 β × β + 2 βγ + 2 γ β + 2 γ + βγ = c ∗ S × β + 2 βγ + 2 γ β + 2 γ + βγ ( D . 22 ) The result is accordingly c S 1 = c ∗ S × β + 2 γ + 2 βγ β + 2 γ + βγ and c S 2 = c ∗ S × β + β 2 + 2 γ + 2 βγ β + 2 γ + βγ c S = c ( 2 . ( a ) ) S 1 + c ( 2 . ( a ) ) S 2 = c ∗ S × 2 β + β 2 + 4 γ + 4 βγ β + 2 γ + βγ ( D . 23 ) The fraction of unbound molecules is fu = c S 1 / c S . Figure D . 2 shows how the number of free and bound S molecules as well as fu depend on the rates k 2 and k 3 . The simulation and the model given by Equation ( D . 23 ) are in a good agreement . The faster the exchange between the bound and the unbound state S 1 and S 2 becomes ( i . e . a higher k 3 ) the more similar both sub - states of S will be . For a slow exchange between both states , the unbound free state approaches the reference concentration c ∗ S ( the model which contained only unbound molecules ) . More diffusion limited reactions ( higher β ) increase the effect . Since the division 162 D . 2 . Simulation Data and Results of Chapter 5 of the S molecules into S 1 and S 2 depends on the actual parameters , the fu and hence the average reaction rate cannot be calculated directly but only by taking the average of the results of Equation ( D . 23 ) . Both E and S are transiently bound The lumped model ( ii ) of this setup looks like the model of the setup above where only S is transiently bound – except that the effective diffusion of the lumped E molecules is not 1 but only δ E = 1 / 2 . In accordance with the results of Section 5 . 2 . 2 the parameter δ will be used to express both : the fraction of unbound molecules and the effective diffusion D eff / D 0 of the molecule species . Similar to the calculation of Eqations ( D . 14 ) - ( D . 22 ) the result for the balance Equation ( 5 . 14 ) is c S 1 c ∗ S = 2 γ + βκ 2 ( δ S 2 = 0 , δ E ) γ ( κ 2 ( δ S 1 = 1 , δ E ) + κ 2 ( δ S 2 = 0 , δ E ) ) + βκ 2 ( δ S 1 = 1 , δ E ) κ 2 ( δ S 2 = 0 , δ E ) c S 2 c ∗ S = 2 γ + βκ 2 ( δ S 1 = 1 , δ E ) γ ( κ 2 ( δ S 1 = 1 , δ E ) + κ 2 ( δ S 2 = 0 , δ E ) ) + βκ 2 ( δ S 1 = 1 , δ E ) κ 2 ( δ S 2 = 0 , δ E ) ( D . 24 ) where κ 2 ( δ i , δ j ) = δ i + δ j δ i + δ j + β × ( 2 − δ i − δ j ) ( D . 25 ) is nothing but a short form of the diffusion limited reaction rate based on Equation ( D . 10 ) . In the more detailed separate model ( i ) – balance Equation ( 5 . 13 ) – the rates r 2 (cid:48) 1 , 1 and r 2 (cid:48) 1 , 2 of the ﬁrst equation as well as r 2 (cid:48) 2 , 1 and r 2 (cid:48) 2 , 2 in the second equation can be combined for an easier treatment . This leads to c S 1 c ∗ S = 2 γ + βκ 3 ( δ S 2 = 0 , δ E ) γ ( κ 3 ( δ S 1 = 1 , δ E ) + κ 3 ( δ S 2 = 0 , δ E ) ) + βκ 3 ( δ S 1 = 1 , δ E ) κ 3 ( δ S 2 = 0 , δ E ) c S 2 c ∗ S = 2 γ + βκ 3 ( δ S 1 = 1 , δ E ) γ ( κ 3 ( δ S 1 = 1 , δ E ) + κ 3 ( δ S 2 = 0 , δ E ) ) + βκ 3 ( δ S 1 = 1 , δ E ) κ 3 ( δ S 2 = 0 , δ E ) ( D . 26 ) where κ 3 contains these two rates in the form of κ 3 ( δ i , δ j ) = δ j κ 2 ( δ i , 1 ) + ( 1 − δ j = κ 2 ( δ i , 0 ) ( D . 27 ) and κ 2 is from Equation ( D . 25 ) . The fraction δ j corresponds to the unbound molecules of species j with the effective diffusion 1 while the fraction ( 1 − δ j ) corresponds to the bound molecules with effective diffusion 0 . Thus this model can be used to describe any ratio be - tween bound and unbound E molecules . For δ E = 1 both the lumped and separate model become similar and converge towards Equation ( D . 23 ) . Figure D . 3 shows a comparison of both models and the results of the detailed agent based simulations . For the tested parameters the simulation is in agreement with the seperate model given in Equation ( D . 26 ) . Note , that not only the reaction rates but also the ﬂux distribution in the system is affected by transient binding as shown in Figure D . 4 . 163 D .

Simulation Data and Results of Chapter 5 Figure D . 4 : Flux distribution with unbound and transiently bound enzymes . Performance of the Simulation The number of data points critically depends on the performance of the simulation . The computation time for the present data was about a month on an Intel Core2 Quad CPU ( Q6700 , 2 . 66 GHz ) and 2 GB RAM system . The number of molecules was moderately high ( N dummy = 10300 , N E = 20600 , and N S ≈ 4 × 3000 for averaging ) . For an efﬁcient utiliza - tion of the high number of dummy and E molecules several parameter sets and thus several sets of S molecules where tested in the same simulation . The runtime of the process was determined by the number of timesteps until the steady state concentration could be evaluated despite the stochastic noise . This time was in the order of 10 s while ∆ t was in the order of 10 − 6 s , requiring more than a million steps , for each of the altogether millions of molecules ( fortunately bound – i . e . immobile – molecules do not need to be moved ) . Especially for the most diffusion limited rate a small ∆ t had to be chosen in order to yield a sufﬁcient accuracy ( cf . Section 4 . 7 . 2 ) . 165 D . SIMULATION DATA AND MODELS D . 3 Simulation Data and Results of Chapter 7 D . 3 . 1 Parameters of the MAPK - Model The simulation is based on the model of Fujioka et al . [ 89 ] . All parameters like reaction rate constants and molecule concentrations as well as the cell size are taken from this model . Based on the given diameter of the HeLa cell ( 12 . 9 µ m ) and nucleus ( 7 . 36 µ m ) the sur - face of the plasma membrane ( PM ) and the nucleus and also the volume of the cytoplasm ( 915 . 25 µ m 3 ) and the nucleus ( 208 . 75 µ m 3 ) was calculated . • Initial Molecule Numbers ( At t = − 60 s ) : Based on these volumes the molecule num - bers are calculated from the concentration given in Fujioka et al . [ 89 ] ( see Table D . 1 ) . • Equilibrated Molecule Numbers ( At t = 0 ) : The reaction network leads to a steady state distribution different from the initial values by equilibrating the nuclear and cyto - plasmic fraction and also the MEK - ERK - complex ( right column in Table D . 1 ) . • Stimulus : At t = 0 the number of ’kinase’ molecules is set from 0 to 551177 molecules , which starts the signal transduction process ( ’kinase’ = the active receptor complex ) .

Simulation Data and Results of Chapter 7 • Reactions : The reaction network is shown in Figure 7 . 1 . Table D . 2 lists the reactions and Table D . 3 the rate constants ( the incoherent representation of decimal places is inherited from the original data ) . • Special Adjustments for the Simulation in the Gillespie Framework : The spatially nonsegregated simulation using the Gillespie algorithm was conducted in the plasma - membrane compartment ( cf . Section 4 . 5 for a description of the method ) . This com - partment requires concentrations in 1 / µ m 2 and the reaction rate constants had to be adjusted accordingly , based on the surface to volume ratio of the plasma membrane and the cytoplasm . Reactions that take place in the nucleus which has a different volume lead to a recalculated reaction rate constant based on the surface to volume ratio of the plasma membrane and the nucleus . • Special Adjustments for the 3D Simulation in the Particle Tracking Framework : The simulation contains about 3 . 5 - 4 million molecules ( depending on the number of complexes like MEK - ERK which contain actually two molecules in just one ) . With respect to the computation time not all of them should be handled in the particle based three - dimensional simulation framework . Figure D . 5 shows that only the cytoplasmic molecules are modeled in detail . The nuclear import of molecules requires the deﬁni - tion of the respective reaction distance ( see Section 4 . 4 . 1 ) based on the reaction rate which is adjusted with respect of the concentration of the nuclear surface in the cyto - plasm .

Simulation Data and Results of Chapter 7 which the reaction takes place . By this approach about 2 . 8 million particles are handled in the computationally less demanding Gillespie environment leaving a little less than a million molecules which have to be tracked individually through the 3D cytoplasm . • Performance of the Simulation : The actual challenge in this framework is not the huge number of particles but the large timespan of the dynamic activation of about 45 minutes . Due to these computational limitations also a large step length of ∆ x = 100 nm , ∆ t = 1 . 67 ms was used . The radius of the molecules is set to 10 nm in order to avoid diffusion limit effects and allow a correct evaluation of the bimolecular reactions under these circumstances ( cf . Section 4 . 7 . 2 ) . While the Gillespie algorithm requires only a few minutes to simulate this timespan , the detailed particle tracking simulation requires nearly two weeks on one core of a Intel Core2 Quad CPU ( Q6700 , 2 . 66 GHz ) . Molecules are tracked in 3D ( mobile in cytoplasm ) Molecules are tracked individually in 3D ( membrane bound motion ) Molecule number in the compartment is tracked with Gillespie method Plasma membrane Cytoplasm Nucleus Signal input Ras Ras Raf Raf Raf MEK Ras MEK pMEK ERK ERK pERK pMEK ERK MEK MEK pMEK ERK ERK pERK pMEK ERK MEK GDP - Ras Signal output Ras effectors GAP pGAP GEF pGEF Kinase Nucleo - Cytoplasmic Shuttling kinase reaction Binding , Dissociation phosphatase reaction Figure D . 5 : Only the molecules in the cytoplasm are modeled explicitly in the particle tracking al - gorithm in order to reduce the number of particles that has to be tracked in the particle based 3D simulation : The upstream part of the cascade which takes place only in the plasma membrane and the nuclear part of the signal transduction are modeled in the Gillespie framework ( as described in Section 4 . 5 ) in order reduce the number of molecules which have to be tracked through the cell . The Ras - Raf complex is the ﬁrst molecule in the cascade which is represented as an agent in the simu - lation , located at the plasma membrane , so that it can react with cytoplasmic MEK molecule - agents . The resulting Ras - Raf - MEK complex and its decay is again simulated in the Gillespie framework , decaying into agent - based Ras - Raf and MEK or pMEK molecules respectively . The agent - based cy - toplasmic MEK , ERK and MEK - ERK molecules can enter the nucleus by binding to it . The number of molecules in the nucleus , their reactions , and the export into the cytosol is again tracked in the Gillespie framework . 169 D .

Note : Coat which is bound to vesicles is tracked in the vesicles . Therefore they do not need an extra species identiﬁer in the particle framework ( the same holds for motor and SNARE proteins ) .

( The binding rate is given by the number of coat / motor catching proteins and the respective interaction rate . ) 1 It is worth noting , that the simulation runs faster if the number of cytoplasmic molecules ( which are tracked as individual agents ) is smaller . Accordingly it is helpful to adjust the rate determining factors k xyz × c x = const with a minimal concentration ( still , one molecule agent could represent 10 real molecules in order to match the in vivo numbers ) . 173 D .

After 600 seconds only 76 fusion events have been recorded , of which the majority ( 70 ) where backward fusion events . Due to the bad transport properties of diffusion the number of vesicles in the cell is constantly increasing . The evaluation of the budded vesicles equals the results of the dipole system . A superimposed time - laps image of the vesicle motion is shown in Figure D . 7 .

After 600 seconds only 130 fusion events have been recorded , which increased to 217 fusion events after 900 seconds . This splits into 130 forward fusions with the correct target com - partment and 87 backward fusions with the donor compartment .

SIMULATION DATA AND MODELS Figure D . 9 : Visualization of all vesicle positions over 100 s moving with motor proteins along a linearly polarized cytoskeleton . Obviously , many vesicles miss the target compartment and accumulate at the plasma membrane . The green dots indicate the starting point of a vesicle track , red points a fusion event . The dark and light blue ’tracks’ correspond to forward and recycling vesicles starting from compartment 1 , the dark and light yellow tracks to vesicles starting from compartment 2 . by coat 2 . In the same time 56 vesicles formed by coat 1 but only 13 recycling vesicles fused backward to their donor compartment 1 . The numbers for compartment 2 are 93 ( 48 recy - cling ) vesicles for the forward fusion and 50 ( 8 recycling ) vesicles for the backward fusion . Obviously the regular vesicles carried to many SNARE molecules making the backward fu - sion more likely , while the recycling vesicles with the lower SNARE content reached the desired target with a high probability . Direct Cytoskeleton Connection Between the Compartments This simulation was run with a slightly altered conﬁguration . The differences are listed in the following : • Initial SNARE numbers The initial number of SNARE 1 − 4 was 48000 , 5000 , 4800 , and 15000 in compartment 1 and 4800 , 15000 , 48000 , and 5000 in compartment 2 . • Coat - Anchor interaction at the budding sites : this tuning factor for the budding rate at the budding sites next to the cables was set to 0 . 0001 for all coats and budding sites . • Coat and Motor Catching : The bimolecular rate constant was set to k = 2 × 10 6 l / mol / s for the coat catching reaction and k = 2 × 10 5 l / mol / s for the motor catching reaction . The initial number of free coat molecules was , in turn , set to 5713 molecules for each type and to 6855 motor proteins of each type respectively . • Coat depolymerizationRate = 0 . 5 1 / s . 178 D . 5 . Simulation Results of Vesicle Transport and Model Parameters Figure D . 10 : Visualization of all vesicle positions over 240 s moving with motor proteins along a cy - toskeleton which is polarized in a dipole structure between both compartments . The emanating vesicle tracks clearly represent the dipole structure and mostly arrive at their designated target compartment . The green dots indicate the starting point of a vesicle track , red points a fusion event . The dark and light blue ’tracks’ correspond to forward and recycling vesicles starting from compartment 1 , the dark and light yellow tracks to vesicles starting from compartment 2 . With the given parameters the ﬁrst 400 vesicles were split into 202 ( 15 recycling ) vesicles budding from compartment 1 and 169 ( 14 recycling ) vesicles from compartment 2 . The budding time was 0 . 39 seconds for regular vesicles and 0 . 7 seconds for recycling vesicles . Regular vesicles contained 15 v - SNAREs for the forward fusion , while recycling vesicles carried 5 v - SNAREs of each type ( SNARE 1 , SNARE 3 ) . The ﬁrst 400 fusion events ere distributed as follows : 178 ( 14 recycling vesicles ) forward fusion events in the transport direction from compartment 1 to compartment 2 , and 24 ( 1 ) backward fusions . In the reverse direction there were 152 ( 12 ) forward fusion events and 12 ( 2 ) backward fusion events . This setup had the most effective forward fusion probability of all setups . Also the average travel time was around 15 seconds , which was the fastest time in all tested conﬁgurations . Endocytosis and Exocytosis without Motor Proteins In this and the following section the plasma membrane is one of the two compartments . It contains initially 25 budding sites , 2 , 500 bound coat 1 molecules , 20 , 000 SNARE 1 and 48 , 000 SNARE 2 molecules , as well as 16 , 000 cargo 2 molecules . The cytoplasm contains 5750 free coat molecules of each species . Cargo 2 ( the receptor Ste2p ) is converted into cargo 1 ( Ste2p - α ) in a ﬁrst order reaction with rate constant k = 0 . 25 1 / s . The binding and dissociation of coat and motor proteins to the plasma membrane is given in Table D . 7 ( although in this simulation no motor protein was 179 D . SIMULATION DATA AND MODELS present ) . Coat 2 ( and motor 2 ) do not bind to the membrane . In the other , vesicular compartment ( endosome ) the coat dissociation constant was set to 1 . 0 1 / s and the motor dissociation constant to 0 . 01 1 / s . The respective bimolecular ( catching ) binding constants are for the coat catching : k = 2 × 10 6 l / mol / s , and for the motor catching : k = 2 × 10 5 l / mol / s ( the compartment only had an afﬁnity for the second subspecies of each kind ) . The coat depolymerizationrate was set to 0 . 5 1 / s . The budding probability per initial coat - cargo pair and time step was increased to p = 1 × 10 − 3 . Also the coat - snare interaction for SNARE 1 and either coat was increased to 2 . 5 × 10 − 3 µ m 2 / s , and the SNARE interaction matrix is adjusted to SNARE - SNARE snare 1 snare 2 snare 3 snare 4 snare 1 0 . 0 2 . 0 0 . 0 2 . 0 snare 2 2 . 0 0 . 0 2 . 0 0 . 0 snare 3 0 . 0 2 . 0 0 . 0 2 . 0 snare 4 2 . 0 0 . 0 2 . 0 0 . 0 The velocity of the actin boost is set to 0 . 25 µ m / s .

Even after 900 seconds only a small fraction of the vesicles has reached another com - partment due to the undirected transport properties of diffusion . The vesicles budding from the endosome were similar to the previous simulations due to the similar parameters . The vesicles which budded from the plasma membrane had the following properties ( average of 226 vesicles ) : They were formed by coat 1 , and the budding process took on average 67 seconds ( the reduced polymerization rate might be due to the diffusion limited nature of the explicitly modeled re - action in the membrane ) . Snare 1 16 molecules and cargo 1 32 molecules were loaded up to the saturation limited which led to equal numbers in all vesicles . The vesicles did not contain 180 D . 5 . Simulation Results of Vesicle Transport and Model Parameters further molecules . Out of the ﬁrst 100 vesicles that were formed ( within 177 seconds ) , 46 have reached a tar - get compartment within 900 seconds of the simulation , the remaining 54 were still diffusing around . More in detail , out of the 53 vesicles originating from the plasma membrane only 6 reached the endosome and 13 returned to the plasma membrane . 11 vesicles out of the 46 starting from the endosome reached the plasma membrane while 16 returned to the endo - some . Due to the undirected process the time of ﬂight for the individual vesicles was strongly diverging . Endocytosis and Exocytosis with Motor Proteins This setup was similar to the previous one , just the respective motor proteins were added : 10 , 000 motor 1 molecules in the plasma membrane , 5750 motor 1 and motor 2 molecules in the cytosol , and 4000 motor 2 molecules in the endosome . The vesicles budding from the plasma membrane carried on average 7 . 9 motor 1 molecules , the vesicles budding from the endosome 8 . 0 motor 2 and 0 . 25 motor 1 molecules . The directed transport led to 213 forward fusion events for the endocytic vesicles ( and no backward fusion – also due to the actin boost pushing the vesicles away from the plasma membrane ) . 172 exocytic vesicles reached the plasma membrane , and only 15 backward fusion events were recorded for this vesicle type within the ﬁrst 400 fusion events . 181 D .

SIMULATION DATA AND MODELS • Note , that vesicle fusion is goverened by the SNARE 1 molecule in both directions . Accordingly the target of the vesicles is deﬁned by the motor proteins which carry the vesicle towards the correct target in the radially polarized cytoskeleton . D . 6 . 2 Cytoskeleton Structure Figure D . 11 : Cytoskeleton structure of the receptor mediated endocytosis simulation . The polarized structure is created based on a dipole vector - ﬁeld . The endosome is in one pole , the second pole is outside of the cell . The nucleus is slightly shifted to the left ( however , the correct in vivo posi - tion would rather be right of the en - dosome in a polarized cell as dis - cussed in Section 8 . 4 . 2 ) .

Parameters and Results of the Receptor Mediated Endocytosis Example D . 6 . 3 Remarks on Modeling Endocytosis In general , the number / concentration of receptor molecules can be tracked by a set of differen - tial equations . For simplicitly space is neglected , and in the given model shown in Figure 9 . 2 the number of active receptor ligand complexes ( RL ) and the inactive receptors ( R ) would be : dc RL dt = + r 1 − r 2 = k 1 c R − k 2 c RL dc R dt = − r 1 + r 2 = − k 1 c R + k 2 c RL ( D . 28 ) More in detail , including the compartmentalization and endocytosis the system becomes : dc PMRL dt = r 1 − r 3 = k 1 c PMR − k 3 c PMRL dc EndoRL dt = r 3 − r 2 = k 3 c PMRL − k 2 c EndoRL dc EndoR dt = r 2 − r 4 = k 2 c EndoRL − k 4 c EndoR dc PMR dt = r 4 − r 1 = k 4 c EndoR − k 1 c PMR ( D . 29 ) which involves the rates r 3 and r 4 describing the endo - and exocytosis process and the corre - sponding rate constants . Obviously , the transport vesicles do not reach the target compartment instantaneously but require some time . This could be modeled by using delay differential equations with the respective travel times τ 3 for the average travel time of and endocytic vesi - cle from the plasma membrane to the endosome , and τ 4 for the reverse exocytic / recycling process . dc PMRL dt = k 1 c PMR − k 3 c PMRL dc EndoRL dt = k 3 c PMRL ( t − τ 3 ) − k 2 c EndoRL dc EndoR dt = k 2 c EndoRL − k 4 c EndoR dc PMR dt = k 4 c EndoR ( t − τ 4 ) − k 1 c PMR ( D . 30 ) This system of delay differential equations already contains 6 parameters , namely 4 rate con - stants and 2 delay constants . During the travel time , the receptors are in an intermediary compartment , or simply in transit ( iT ) . So in order to keep the simpler structure of plain ordinary differential equations , instead of delay differential equations , the systems could be extended to a system of 6 differential equations with 6 rate constants ( 6 parameters , similar 185 D . SIMULATION DATA AND MODELS to Equation ( D . 30 ) ) : dc PMRL dt = k 1 c PMR − k 31 c PMRL dc iTRL dt = k 31 c PMRL − k 32 c iTRL dc EndoRL dt = k 32 c iTRL − k 2 c EndoRL dc EndoR dt = k 2 c EndoRL − k 41 c EndoR dc iTR dt = k 41 c EndoR − k 42 c iTR ( D . 31 ) dc PMR dt = k 42 c iTR − k 1 c PMR In addition , also the formation of the vesicle , i . e . the budding process and the corresponding delay could be included as well . . . The differences are discussed in the following . • Correlation with the Vesicle Model : Obviously , all parameters and dynamics of the complex vesicle model / machinery governing the budding , transport , and fusion pro - cesses and thus the endocytosis of the receptors are lumped into the rate constants k 3 and k 4 and if applicable the delay constants τ 3 and τ 4 . Especially in the more com - plex formulation of the system including the transport time τ ( or the in transit status respectively ) , the relation with the budding and transport processes with the complex vesicle machinery becomes visible . However , the regulative / controlling power of the individual interactions of the vesicle machinery are hidden and cannot be analyzed . • Combinatorial Explosion and Complexity : This example shows , how quickly the number of parameters increases if more aspects are included in the model . The result - ing complexity can however hamper the identiﬁability , predictability , or usability of the model . It is also worth noting , that the agreement of the proﬁle of c PMRL ( t ) with the out - come of the detailed simulation including the vesicle machinery becomes better if there are more adjustable parameters in the ODE model ( data not shown – the best agreement was reached by Equations ( D . 30 ) which in addition included a τ 1 representing the delay due to the clustering / budding process in the plasma membrane ) . • Modeling Aims : This example shows the important need to critically determine the aim of the model in order to optimize detail , complexity , and performance of the model in accordance to the underlying questions . 6 - 7 parameters are sufﬁcient to describe the dynamics of the receptor mediated endocytosis . However the detailed functionality of the vesicle machinery can only be analyzed in the complex model setup for the agent - based simulation with a multitude of ( interrelated ) parameters . 186 Bibliography 1 .
