It 2 remains unclear how such inherently noisy processes generate robust cellular behavior . We employed 3 high - speed imaging of migrating neutrophil - like HL - 60 cells to explore the fine - scale shape fluctuations 4 that emerge and relax throughout the process of leading edge maintenance . We then developed a minimal 5 stochastic model of the leading edge that reproduces this stable relaxation behavior . Remarkably , we find 6 lamellipodial stability naturally emerges from the interplay between branched actin network growth and 7 leading edge shape – with no additional feedback required – based on a synergy between membrane - 8 proximal branching and lateral spreading of filaments . These results thus demonstrate a novel biological 9 noise - suppression mechanism based entirely on system geometry . Furthermore , our model suggests that 10 the Arp2 / 3 - mediated ~ 70 - 80º branching angle optimally smooths lamellipodial shape , addressing its long - 11 mysterious conservation from protists to mammals . 12 13 Significance Statement All cellular functions are driven by the stochastic dynamics of macromolecules , 14 and thus are subject to biological noise . Here , as a model system for noise - suppression in the context of 15 cell migration , we investigate lamellipodial maintenance – where thousands of stochastically 16 polymerizing filaments self - organize into a highly - stable , micron - scale leading edge . Combining 17 experiment and computational modeling , we ( 1 ) establish lamellipodial stability is an emergent property 18 of dendritically - branched actin network growth , ( 2 ) outline a noise - suppression mechanism based on the 19 geometry of lamellipodial actin , and ( 3 ) determine the evolutionarily - conserved Arp2 / 3 - mediated 20 ~ 70 - 80º branching angle optimally suppresses stochastic fluctuations . Our results not only explain the 21 essential role of Arp2 / 3 - mediated branching in lamellipodial formation , but also address the decades - old 22 question of why this specific geometry is so well - conserved . 23 Garner and Theriot , confidential manuscript 3 Introduction 24 Cell migration driven by actin polymerization plays an essential role in countless organisms spanning the 25 eukaryotic tree of life 1 – 3 . Across this broad phylogeny , cells have been observed to form a dizzying array 26 of protrusive actin structures , each exhibiting unique physical and biological properties 4 . In all cases , the 27 fundamental molecular unit of these micron - scale structures is the single actin filament , which 28 polymerizes stochastically by addition of single monomers to push the leading edge membrane forward 5 – 29 8 . Higher - order actin structures , and the biological functions they robustly enable , are therefore mediated 30 by the collective action of thousands of stochastically growing filaments 9 . It remains an open question 31 how cells control for – or leverage – this inherent stochasticity to maintain stable leading edge protrusions 32 over length and time scales more than three orders of magnitude larger than the scales of actin monomer 33 addition 10 , 11 . 34 Perhaps the archetype of dynamically stable actin structures is the lamellipodium , a flat “leaf - like” 35 protrusion that is ~ 200 nm tall , up to 100 µm wide , and filled with a dense network of dendritically 36 branched actin filaments 12 – 15 . Cell types that undergo lamellipodial migration ( most notably fish epidermal 37 keratocytes and vertebrate neutrophils ) can maintain a single , stable lamellipodium for minutes to hours , 38 allowing the cells to carry out their biological functions 16 , 17 . For example , in their in vivo role as first 39 responders of the innate immune system , neutrophils must undergo persistent migration over 40 millimeter - scale distances to reach sites of inflammation and infection 18 , 19 . Regardless of the cell type , 41 the origins of this striking stability in the face of stochastic actin filament polymerization remain elusive . 42 It has been widely been assumed for decades that some sort of regulatory or mechanical feedback 43 mechanism must be required for lamellipodial shape stability , with extensive experimental efforts 44 identifying membrane tension 20 – 26 , plasma membrane curvature - sensing proteins 24 , 27 , a competition for 45 membrane - associated free monomers 28 , and force - feedback via directional filament branching 29 as 46 potential contributors . The stability of lamellipodia has also been theoretically proposed to depend on the 47 Garner and Theriot , confidential manuscript 4 dendritically branched structure of their actin networks , wherein filaments are oriented at an angle relative 48 to the cell’s direction of migration , allowing growing filament tips to spread out laterally along the leading 49 edge as they polymerize 17 , 30 . ( Although any acute angle would permit spreading , we note that filament 50 orientation in cells has been experimentally observed to be highly stereotyped , averaging ±35º relative to 51 the membrane normal 31 , 32 – approximately one half of the highly evolutionarily - conserved ~ 70º branch 52 angle mediated by the Arp2 / 3 complex 33 – 35 . ) In contrast to the proposed stabilizing role of spreading , 53 several other features of lamellipodial actin are known to impart nonlinearities on network growth , which 54 might amplify stochastic fluctuations . For instance , dendritic branching is an autocatalytic process which 55 can lead to explosive growth 28 , 36 . In addition , the growth rates of the actin network are dependent on the 56 velocity of the flexible membrane surface it is pushing , in a manner which imparts hysteresis to the 57 system 22 , 37 . How spreading might interact with these complexities – and the ultimate consequences for 58 maintenance of a stable leading edge – remains unknown . 59 Seeking to dissect the origins of lamellipodial stability , we pursued complimentary experimental 60 and computational methodologies . First , we performed high - speed , high - resolution microscopy on 61 migrating human neutrophil - like HL - 60 cells to monitor their leading edge shape dynamics . In contrast to 62 the remarkable overall lamellipodial stability observed over minutes , high - speed imaging revealed that 63 the leading edge shape is extremely dynamic at shorter time and length scales , constantly undergoing fine - 64 scale fluctuations around the average cell shape . We determined that these shape fluctuations continually 65 dissipate ( thereby enabling long time scale lamellipodial maintenance ) in a manner quantitatively 66 consistent with viscous relaxation back to the time - averaged leading edge shape . We next developed a 67 minimal stochastic model of branched actin network growth against a flexible membrane , broadly 68 applicable to a wide variety of cell types , that was able to recapitulate the global leading edge stability and 69 fine - scale fluctuation relaxation behavior observed in cells . Our model suggests that the suppression of 70 Garner and Theriot , confidential manuscript 5 stochastic fluctuations is an intrinsic , emergent property of collective actin dynamics at the leading edge , 71 as branched network geometry alone is necessary and sufficient to generate lamellipodial stability . 72 Moreover , we find that the evolutionarily - conserved geometry , the ~ 70° branching angle of the Arp2 / 3 73 complex , optimally quells shape fluctuations . 74 75 Results : 76 Fine - scale leading edge shape fluctuations revealed at high spatiotemporal resolution 77 Neutrophils form lamellipodia that are intrinsically lamellar , maintaining a thin , locally flat sheet 78 of actin even in the absence of support structures like the substrate surface 15 . Here , we study the migration 79 of neutrophil - like HL - 60 cells 38 within quasi - two - dimensional confinement between a glass coverslip and 80 an agarose pad overlay 39 . In addition to serving as an excellent in vitro model for neutrophil surveillance 81 of tissues , this assay allows for easy visualization and quantification of lamellipodial dynamics by 82 restraining the lamellipodium to a single imaging plane . Cells in this type of confinement can migrate 83 persistently , maintaining nearly - constant cell shape , for time scales on the order of minutes to hours 16 , 40 . 84 In order to capture leading edge dynamics on time scales more relevant to the stochastic growth of 85 individual filaments , we performed high - speed ( 20 Hz ) imaging of migrating HL - 60 cells . These 86 experiments revealed dynamic , fine - scale fluctuations around the average leading edge shape ( Fig . 1a - c , 87 Movie S1 , Fig . S1 - 2 , Methods ) , where local instabilities in the leading edge emerge , grow , and then relax . 88 Notably , these previously - unobserved lamellipodial dynamics are phenotypically distinct from – and 89 almost 100 - fold faster than – the oscillatory protrusion - retraction cycles seen in other , slower moving cell 90 types ( e . g . fibroblasts ) 41 – 43 . 91 Garner and Theriot , confidential manuscript 6 We estimate we were able to reliably measure fluctuations with wavelengths as small as ~ 650 nm , 92 and amplitudes down to ~ 65 nm , by fitting the phase contrast halo around the leading edge ( Fig . S1 - 2 , 93 Methods ) . These values should approximately correspond to 25 actin filaments at physiological spacing 12 94 Fig . 1 : High - speed , high - resolution imaging reveals fine - scale fluctuations in leading edge shape .

Garner and Theriot , confidential manuscript 7 and 25 actin monomers assembled into a filament lattice along the direction of motion . While our 95 measurements of shape dynamics cannot resolve polymerization events of individual filaments , our results 96 are consistent with the hypothesis that stochasticity in actin growth at the level of monomer addition – 97 occurring throughout the leading edge actin network – ultimately manifests as the observed micron - scale 98 leading edge fluctuations . In particular , kymograph analysis of curvature and velocity ( Fig . 1b - c ) showed 99 that relatively long - lived shape fluctuations are formed by the continual time - integration of seemingly 100 uncorrelated and very short - lived ( sub - second , sub - micron ) velocity fluctuations . Because the average cell 101 shape remains constant over time , there must be some form of feedback acting on leading edge curvature 102 to sustain stable lamellipodial growth . These rich , measurable fine - scale dynamics therefore provide a 103 unique opportunity to directly observe the time - evolution of leading edge maintenance . Taking advantage 104 of our high - precision measurements , we aimed to quantitatively investigate the properties of the observed 105 fluctuations , with the goal of determining the mechanisms by which molecular machinery at the leading 106 edge coordinates the stochastic polymerization of individual actin filaments . 107 108 Lamellipodial stability mediated by viscous relaxation of shape fluctuations 109 The relaxation of fine - scale shape fluctuations back to the steady - state leading edge shape is 110 essential for the long time scale stability of lamellipodia . As for any physical system , the nature of this 111 relaxation reflects the system’s underly ing physical properties ; in this case , the characteristics of – and 112 interactions between – actin filaments and the membrane . To provide a framework for exploration of the 113 physical mechanisms underlying stable lamellipodial protrusion , we quantified the relaxation dynamics 114 by performing time - autocorrelation analysis on the leading edge shape ( Methods ) . Applied in this context , 115 this analytical technique calculates the extent to which the lamellipodium contour loses similarity with the 116 shape at previous time points as fluctuations emerge and relax . As most material systems ( actively - driven 117 Garner and Theriot , confidential manuscript 8 or otherwise ) exhibit relaxation behavior with a characteristic wavelength - dependence ( e . g . , Fig . 1d ) , we 118 performed Fourier decomposition on the leading edge shape to separate out fluctuations at different length 119 scales , and then performed autocorrelation analysis separately on each Fourier mode . We validated our 120 analytical methods using simulations of membrane dynamics , for which there exists a well - established 121 analytical theory ( Methods , Fig . S3 ) , and show that our results are not sensitive to an extension of our 122 analysis to longer length and time scales ( Methods , Fig . S4 - 5 ) . Further , the membrane simulation control 123 nicely demonstrates how visual features of curvature kymographs ( e . g . , Fig . 1b ) can be misleading 124 ( Methods , Fig . S3 ) , and motivates the necessity of our more comprehensive technique . 125 Autocorrelation analysis revealed a monotonic relaxation of shape fluctuations at each wavelength 126 ( Fig . 1e - f ) ; the decay at every spatial scale is well - fit by an exponential form ( Fig . 1f ) , consistent with 127 overdamped viscous relaxation . Importantly , we do not detect any increase in the autocorrelation over 128 time , which would have appeared if there were any sustained , correlated growth of the fluctuations before 129 they decay . This again suggests that the fluctuations arise from uncorrelated stochastic processes , such as 130 fluctuations in actin density . A clear wavelength - dependence is observed , with shorter wavelengths 131 decaying faster and having smaller amplitudes ( Fig . 1g - h ) . This general trend is shared by many physical 132 systems with linear elastic constraints , such as idealized membranes 44 and polymers 45 freely fluctuating 133 under Brownian motion , but can be contrasted with systems that have a dominant wavelength , as in the 134 case of buckling or wrinkling of materials under compression 46 . Importantly , these qualitative and 135 quantitative properties of the leading edge fluctuations are not specific to cell type or experimental 136 conditions ( e . g . , agarose overlay , ECM ) , as we also observe this phenomenon in fish epidermal 137 keratocytes ( Fig . S6 , Movie S2 ) . 138 139 140 Garner and Theriot , confidential manuscript 9 Leading edge stability as an emergent property of branched actin growth 141 The rich behavior and quantitative nature of our leading edge shape fluctuation data made them 142 ideal for comparison with physical models . In order to understand how molecular - scale actin assembly 143 and biomechanics might give rise to the observed micron - scale shape dynamics , we aimed to reproduce 144 this behavior in a stochastic model of branched actin network growth against a membrane ( Fig . 2a - c , 145 Movie S3 , Methods ) . Previous stochastic models of protrusive actin - based forces largely focused on actin 146 polymerization against rigid obstacles ( e . g . , the bacterial cell wall for the Listeria comet tail 36 , 47 or a single , 147 flat membrane segment in models of lamellipodia 22 ) . Expanding on this general framework , and in an 148 approach conceptually similar to previous work simulating small ( < 2 µm ) patches of a lamellipodium 48 , 49 , 149 we incorporated a two - dimensional leading edge with filaments polymerizing against a flexible 150 membrane , which we modeled as a system of flat membrane segments coupled elastically to each other . 151 The size of the membrane segments was comparable to the spatial resolution of our experimental 152 measurements , allowing us to assay fluctuations over a similar dynamic range of wavelengths . Simulated 153 filaments apply force to the membrane following the classic untethered Brownian ratchet formalism 5 , 154 consistent with recent experiments showing that cellular protrusions are formed by largely untethered 155 actin networks 50 . Designed to be as comparable as possible to our experimental data , the model 156 incorporated experimentally - measured values from the literature for the membrane tension , membrane 157 bending modulus , and biochemical rate constants ( Table 1 - 2 ) 5 , 51 . As we were specifically interested in 158 identifying biophysical mechanisms regulating leading edge stability , we minimized the model’s 159 Garner and Theriot , confidential manuscript 10 160 Fig . 2 : Minimal model of branched actin growth recapitulates leading edge stability and shape fluctuation relaxation .

Garner and Theriot , confidential manuscript 11 biological complexity by including only the core biochemical elements of actin network growth dynamics : 161 polymerization , depolymerization , branching , and capping . All filament nucleation in the model occurs 162 through dendritic branching ( observed in cells to be mediated by the Arp2 / 3 complex 3 , 12 , which catalyzes 163 the nucleation of new “daughter” actin filaments as branches from the sides of pre - existing “mother” 164 filaments at a characteristic angle of ~ 70º 33 – 35 ) . By simulating individual filament kinetics , the model 165 captures the evolutionary dynamics of the filament network , allowing us to directly test hypothesized 166 mechanisms for the interplay between actin network properties ( e . g . , filament orientation ) and protrusion 167 dynamics 5 , 17 , 22 , 30 , 31 , 48 ( Fig . 2b ) . 168 To our great surprise , this very simple model was able to recapitulate stable leading edge 169 fluctuations . Nascent leading edges reach steady state values for filament density , filament length , 170 filament angle , membrane velocity , and ( most importantly ) membrane fluctuation amplitude within 171 seconds , a biologically realistic time scale ( Fig . 2d - h ) . Furthermore , the steady state values obtained are 172 in quantitative agreement with both our own experimental data and previously published measurements , 173 with the model yielding mean values of : 0 . 3 filaments / nm for filament density ( ~ 30 nm filament spacing 174 for a lamellipodium that is 10 filaments tall 13 ) , ~ 150 nm for filament length , ~ 40° for filament angle ( with 175 respect to the direction of migration ) , ~ 0 . 35 nm / ms for membrane velocity , and ~ 50 nm for membrane 176 fluctuation amplitude 12 , 31 , 32 . 177 As observed in the experimental measurements , simulated leading edge shape stability is mediated 178 by an exponential decay of shape fluctuations ( Fig . 2i - j ) . Furthermore , the minimal model correctly 179 predicts the monotonic trends of fluctuation amplitude and decay time scale with wavelength ( Fig . 2k - l ) 180 in a way that was not sensitive to our choices of simulation time step , membrane segment length , and 181 overall length of the leading edge ( Fig . S7 - 9 ) . It should be noted that the generation of the simulated data 182 in Figure 2k - l did not involve any curve - fitting ( and therefore no free parameters that could be fit ) to the 183 Garner and Theriot , confidential manuscript 12 experimentally - measured autocorrelation dynamics in order to parameterize the model . Rather , the 184 simulated fluctuation relaxation behavior , qualitatively reproducing our experimental measurements , 185 emerges directly from the molecular - scale actin growth model , in which all biochemical parameters were 186 estimated from measurements in the existing literature ( Table 1 - 2 ) – leaving no free simulation 187 parameters . 188 189 Predicting effects of drug treatment with Latrunculin B 190 We were interested in further assaying the predictive power of this minimal stochastic model by 191 determining whether the output of the simulations was congruent with experimental observations under 192 conditions that had not been tested prior to model development . As an example , we elected to test whether 193 the model could correctly predict the response of HL - 60 cells to treatment with the drug Latrunculin B , 194 which binds to and sequesters actin monomers . Qualitatively , cells treated with Latrunculin B ( Movie S4 ) 195 present with enhanced bleb formation and more variable leading edge shapes , in comparison with cells 196 treated with a DMSO vehicle control ( Movie S5 ) . In our model , addition of this drug can be simulated by 197 reducing the free monomer concentration , which consequently reduces both the polymerization rate and 198 the branching rate . At low effective doses , subtle but measurable changes to leading edge fluctuations 199 were predicted : specifically , an increase in the amplitudes at large wavelengths , and a decrease in the 200 decay rates across all wavelengths ( Fig 3a - b ) . Our experimental results were consistent with these 201 quantiative predictions ; Latrunculin B - treated cells exhibited increased fluctuation amplitudes and 202 decreased fluctuation rates over the predicted ranges ( Fig . 3c - d ) . 203 Garner and Theriot , confidential manuscript 13 204 Geometry as the core determinant of simulated leading edge stability 205 Given the success of the model in reproducing experimental results , we next wanted to determine 206 which features of the simulation were responsible for leading edge stability and relaxation of fluctuations . 207 The simplicity of the model allowed us to determine the stability mechanism by process of elimination , 208 selectively removing elements of the model ( Methods ) and determining whether stability was retained . To 209 assay the importance of membrane tension and bending rigidity , which has been suggested to be a key 210 factor regulating lamellipodial organization 25 , 26 , we simply removed the forces between the membrane 211 segments ( Fig . 2a , F spring ) from the simulation ( Methods ) . Surprisingly , the coupling between the 212 membrane segments ( i . e . , the effects of tension and bending at length scales larger than the size of an 213 individual membrane segment ) was completely dispensable for leading edge stability ( Fig . 4a - e ) . 214 Fig . 3 : Minimal model correctly predicts response of HL - 60 cells to drug treatment .

Garner and Theriot , confidential manuscript 14 Following a similar process of elimination , we determined that in fact only two elements were required 215 for stability . First , as reported previously for dendritic actin network polymerization against a single stiff 216 obstacle , it was necessary to constrain branching to occur only within a fixed distance from the leading 217 edge membrane ( Fig . 2a - b ) in order to maintain a steady state actin density 36 . The molecular motivation 218 for this spatially limited “branching window” is rooted in that fact that activators of the Arp2 / 3 complex , 219 which render Arp2 / 3 competent for actin filament nucleation , are typically membrane - associated 220 proteins 52 . Second , we found that stability is inherently tied to the ability of filaments to spread laterally 221 Fig . 4 : Simulated lamellipodial stability is governed by leading edge geometry .

( j ) Schematic representing the proposed molecular mechanism underlying the stability of leading edge shape , with time increasing from I - IV . Garner and Theriot , confidential manuscript 15 to neighboring membrane segments ( Fig . 2b II - III , Fig . 4f - i ) . ( Recall that , because the branched actin 222 network geometry causes filaments to grow , on average , at an angle relative to the membrane normal 31 , 32 , 223 polymerizing tips spread laterally along the leading edge 17 , 30 . ) Removing filament spreading from the 224 model by fixing filaments to remain associated with their nearest membrane segment at birth ( Methods ) 225 led to actin density divergence : network regions with low filament density eventually underwent complete 226 depolymerization , while high - density regions continued to accumulate actin ( Fig . 4f - g ) . 227 These findings lead us to a simple molecular feedback mechanism for leading edge stability , based 228 on a synergy between filament spreading and membrane - proximal branching ( Fig . 4j ) : To begin with , 229 regions with initially high filament density come to protrude beyond the average position of the rest of the 230 membrane , representing the emergence of a leading edge shape fluctuation ( Fig . 4j , I - II ) . This induces 231 asymmetric filament spreading , where filaments from high - density regions can spread productively into 232 neighboring regions ( Fig . 2b , II ) , but filaments spreading from adjacent low - density regions cannot keep 233 up with the fast moving membrane segments ( Fig . 2b , III ) , and thus are unproductive ( Fig . 4j , II - III ) . In 234 this way , the branched geometry inherent to dendritic actin polymerization , as well as its interaction with 235 the shape of the membrane , naturally encodes leading edge stability ( Fig . 4j , IV ) . Thus our results directly 236 demonstrate a “stability - through - spreading” mechanism that has previously only been assumed in mean - 237 field analytical theories 17 , 30 . Remarkably , this means that leading edge maintenance is an intrinsic , 238 emergent property of branched actin network growth against a membrane , without requiring any further 239 regulatory governance . Geometrical constraints imposed simply by the nature of membrane - proximal 240 actin branching ensure that any small variations in either local actin filament density or growth rate are 241 inherently self - correcting to regress toward the mean . 242 Of note , it has previously been shown that Arp2 / 3 - mediated branching is required for lamellipodial 243 formation in a wide variety of cell types ; cells with inhibited or depleted Arp2 / 3 complex exhibit complete 244 Garner and Theriot , confidential manuscript 16 disruption of the lamellipodium shape and often switch to a different mode of migration altogether , such 245 as filopodial motility 15 , 53 – 55 . Indeed , HL - 60s treated with the Arp2 / 3 inhibitor CK - 666 have extremely 246 variable leading edge shapes , characterized by long , thin filopodia - like protrusions ( Movie S6 ) . Our 247 theoretical results provide a mechanistic interpretation for this striking phenomenon , suggesting that the 248 vital lamellipodial maintenance role of Arp2 / 3 - mediated branching stems from its ability to mediate 249 efficient filament spreading and equilibration of actin density fluctuations , purely because the daughter 250 filament always grows at an angle distinct from its mother . 251 252 Optimal suppression of fluctuations by the highly - conserved ~ 70° branching angle 253 Given the essential contribution of branched network geometry to the stability of the simulated 254 leading edges , we reasoned that variations in the branching geometry alone might have a significant effect 255 on leading edge fluctuations . We therefore performed simulations to determine the effects of changing the 256 average branching angle and branching angle variability on filament orientation , filament density , and 257 leading edge fluctuation fit parameters ( Fig . 5 ) . In this context , we highlight the distinction between the 258 branching angle , θ br ( i . e . , the angle of a daughter filament relative to its mother ) , and the filament angle or 259 orientation , θ f ( i . e . , the angle of a filament relative to the direction of migration ) ( Fig . 5a , inset ) . Due to 260 the sterotypical branching angle , θ br , there is a direct correspondence between the orientation , θ fmother , of 261 a mother filament and the orientation , θ fdaughter , she passes on to her daughter branches . Our simulations 262 are thus , in effect , selection assays , as mother filaments compete to stay within the fixed branching 263 window , spawn daughter branches , and thus pass down their angle to their progeny 31 , 48 . For example , 264 when filaments are initialized with a random orientation , and the branching angle is fixed ( i . e . , there is no 265 Garner and Theriot , confidential manuscript 17 266 Fig . 5 : The genetically - encoded Arp2 / 3 - mediated branching angle is optimal for suppressing leading edge fluctuations .

The surviving , successful filament angles are narrowly and symmetrically 268 distributed around one half of the branching angle ( Fig . 5a - c ) . This optimal filament angle allows mother 269 and daughter filaments to branch back and forth symmetrically about the membrane normal , such that 270 mother filaments do not out - compete their progeny ( as has been described previously ) 31 , 48 , 49 ( Fig . 2b ) . 271 In living cells , branching is mediated by the Arp2 / 3 complex , which has been experimentally 272 measured to form highly regular and sterotyped branches at ~ 70° 33 – 35 . Intriguingly , this protein complex 273 is highly conserved 3 , with measurements of the branching angle in a wide variety of species ( protists 33 – 274 35 , 56 , yeast 35 , mammals 35 , 56 , 57 , and amphibians 58 ) using various experimental techniques ( platinum replica 275 electron microscopy , cryo - electron microscopy , and total internal reflection microscopy ) all falling within 276 the range of 67 - 78° ( ± 2 - 13° ) . The high degree of conservation hints that this specific angle might carry 277 some functional optimality , but the question has not been addressable experimentally ; due to the lack of 278 naturally occuring Arp2 / 3 variants with a substantially different branching angle , an alternative branching 279 structure would hypothetically have to be designed do novo , presumably by altering the protein interaction 280 interface by which the Arp2 / 3 complex binds to the side of a mother filament 34 . We thus sought to explore 281 the possible functional significance of this conserved angle using our minimal stochastic model . 282 Excitingly , we found that in simulations with no branch angle variability , a 70 - 80° branching angle was 283 optimal for minimizing both actin density fluctuations ( Fig . 5d , i ) and leading edge fluctuation amplitudes 284 for wavelengths smaller than ~ 2 µm ( Fig . 5f , h ) . These smoothing effects are therefore predicted to be 285 ( Fig . 5 continued ) medians over 40 simulations for each condition . Red error bars – standard error .

Garner and Theriot , confidential manuscript 19 relevant within the experimentally - measurable range of wavelengths ( between ~ 0 . 7 µm and ~ 2 µm ) , but 286 are most beneficial for the smallest wavelengths resolved by our simulations ( down to ~ 0 . 3 µm ) – closest 287 to the length scales of individual filament polymerization . Overall , these results provide tantalizing 288 mechanistic insight into the long - standing question of why the characteristic branching angle is so 289 ubiquitous . 290 Heritability of filament orientation ( i . e . , the extent to which mother filament orientation determines 291 the orientation of the daughters ) is set by the degree of variability in the branching angle ( which , in turn , 292 reflects the influence of thermal fluctuations ) . Perhaps unsurprisingly , decreasing this orientational 293 heritability significantly reduces the dependence of fluctuation amplitude and filament density variability 294 on the branching angle ( Fig . 5j - q ) , and thereby counteracts the beneficial effect of the optimal angle on 295 leading edge fluctuations . Introducing a branch angle variability of ±2° ( on the lower end of the 296 experimentally - measured values ) broadens the range of near - optimal branch angles but maintains the 297 optimum at ~ 70 - 80° ( Fig . 5j , l ) , while introducing a variability of ±10° ( on the higher end of the measured 298 range ) completely removes the optimum ( Fig . 5n , p ) . In both cases , increasing the branch angle variability 299 increases the minimum possible fluctuation amplitude ( Fig . 5h , l , p – insets ) and filament density variability 300 ( Fig . 5i , m , q ) , representing a decrease in the noise - suppression capabilities of the system . Overall , these 301 results provide strong support for the idea that actin network geometry is not only essential for leading 302 edge stability , but also plays a major role in determining the fundamental limits of smoothness in 303 lamellipodial shape . 304 305 Discussion 306 The emergence of robust collective behaviors from stochastic elements is an enduring biological 307 mystery which we are only beginning to unravel 59 – 65 . The apparent dichotomy in actin - based motility 308 Garner and Theriot , confidential manuscript 20 between the random elongation of individual filaments and the stable formation of smooth and persistent 309 higher - order actin structures such as lamellipodia exemplifies this enigma , and provides an avenue 310 towards understanding general strategies for noise suppression in biological systems . 311 In recent years it has become clear that perturbation - free experiments which examine fluctuations 312 around the mean at steady state ( in contrast to probing the change in the mean due to a perturbation ) can 313 be a powerful tool for understanding noisy systems 66 . In this work , application of that principle in 314 combination with high - precision measurements , quantitative analytical techniques , and physical modeling 315 led to the surprising revelation that the suppression of stochastic fluctuations naturally emerges from the 316 interactions between a growing actin network and the leading edge membrane , with no additional 317 feedback required . Our insights into the molecular mechanisms mediating lamellipodial stability were 318 largely enabled by experimentally measuring micron - scale leading edge shape dynamics and comparing 319 them to a molecular - scale actin network growth model that correctly predicts this emergent behavior ( as 320 well as many other experimentally - measured features of lamellipodial actin networks ) . Ultimately , we 321 hope our results inspire future experimental work to directly measure the nanometer - scale interactions 322 predicted by our simulations , which may be accomplished using super - resolution imaging of actin 323 dynamics in vivo or in an in vitro reconstitution of lamellipodial protrusion ( i . e . , branched polymerization 324 of actin driving the motion of a flexible barrier ) . 325 The model developed in this work provides an understanding of the basic biophysical mechanisms 326 underlying lamellipodial migration . Of course , living cells are home to array of additional complexities 327 which are likely to further modulate leading edge fluctuations and stability , and our model may provide a 328 framework for future exploration of such effects across diverse cell types and experimental conditions . 329 Cells migrating in vivo inevitably experience a much more challenging and dynamic environment , in 330 which additional feedback mechanisms will almost certainly be required for the maintenance of polarized 331 Garner and Theriot , confidential manuscript 21 migration . The simplicity and biophysical realism of our modeling framework should make it particularly 332 well - suited for future studies focused on predicting and understanding the effects of additional potential 333 feedback mechanisms , including tethering 67 – 70 , a limiting monomer concentration 28 , force - dependent 334 branching 29 , 37 , 71 , and regulation by curvature - sensing proteins 24 , 72 . Further , this computational model might 335 be useful for exploring the effects of various extracellular forces , such as those produced by obstacles or 336 variations in matrix density , or intracellular forces , such as those produced by hydrostatics . We also note 337 that a certain degree of biochemical signaling is implicit in our model in the form of biochemical rate 338 constants that are invariant in time and space ; this property relies on signaling networks to maintain 339 uniform gradients of actin - associated molecules 73 . How local biochemical control ( or lack thereof ) over 340 these rate constants might affect leading edge fluctuations remains an interesting avenue for future 341 investigation , both theoretically and experimentally . 342 The defining characteristic and major advance of our model was the explicit inclusion of both the 343 evolutionary dynamics of the actin network and its interaction with the two - dimensional geometry of the 344 leading edge . By selectively removing elements of the model , we determined that lateral filament 345 spreading , combined with a fixed branching window , is indispensable for leading edge stability . This 346 highlights the crucial role in lamellipodial maintenance of the branched structure of actin networks , 347 wherein each daughter filament inherits angular information from its mother . Our further investigations 348 into the evolutionary properties of actin network growth revealed that a ~ 70 - 80° branch angle maximally 349 suppresses fine - scale actin density and leading edge shape fluctuations , showing for the first time that 350 Arp2 / 3 - mediated branching imparts optimal functionality , as was long hypothesized based on strong 351 sequence , structural , and functional conservation throughout the eukaryotic tree of life . It is interesting to 352 note that the evolutionarily - conserved branching angle that we find maximally suppresses leading edge 353 fluctuations appears not to be the same angle that optimizes the polymerization velocity of single filaments 354 Garner and Theriot , confidential manuscript 22 – predicted to be a broad angle closer to ~ 90 - 100 ˚ ( and quite load - dependent ) in the low - load regime 5 . 355 This contrast suggests that evolutionary selection acts at the level of actin network properties , rather than 356 force production by individual filaments . 357 Returning to the broader question of how noisy biological systems control for stochasticity , we 358 find that stability in the case of lamellipodial dynamics is inherently encoded by the geometry of branched 359 actin network growth . It will be interesting to see whether similar principles hold for other cytoskeletal 360 structures with clear geometric constraints , such as endocytic pits , the cytokinetic ring , and the mitotic 361 spindle . 362 Garner and Theriot , confidential manuscript 23 Materials and Methods : 363 HL - 60 cell culture and differentiation . HL - 60 cells were cultured as described previously 39 , 40 . In brief , 364 cells were maintained at a density of 0 . 1 - 1 x 10 5 cells / mL by passaging every 2 - 3 days into fresh RPMI 365 media supplemented with 10 % heat - inactivated fetal bovine serum and antibiotics / antimycotics . 366 Supplementation with 1 . 57 % DMSO was used to differentiate the cells into a neutrophil - like state . Cells 367 were subsequently extracted for experiments at 6 days post - differentiation . Our HL - 60 cell line was 368 obtained from Orion Weiner’s lab at UCSF , who originally received them from Henry Bourne’s lab at 369 UCSF . The identity of this suspension cell line was confirmed based on the behavior of the cells , including 370 differentiating into a neutrophil - like state upon exposure to DMSO that exhibits characteristic phenotypes 371 for substrate adhesion , rapid migration , and elongated morphology . HL - 60s are not listed as a 372 misidentified cell line on the Register of Misidentified Cell Lines . The cell line tested negative to 373 mycoplasma contamination . 374 375 Under - agarose motility assays with HL - 60s . Differentiated HL - 60 cells were plated on fibronectin - coated 376 coverslips and then overlaid with a 1 % agarose pad containing 1nM fMLP ( to enhance migratory 377 behavior ) , as described previously 40 . Microscopy of the migrating cells was performed at 37 ˚ C , using 378 transmitted light to image phase contrast on an epifluorescence microscope at 100X magnification ( 100x 379 1 . 45NA Plan Apo oil objective , Nikon MRD31905 ) . A more detailed description of our microscopy 380 system can be found in previous publications 40 . For treatment with Latrunculin B or CK - 666 , the drug 381 was embedded into the agarose pad by adding the drug to the unpolymerized agarose pad solution before 382 gelling ( at the same time as adding fMLP ) , such that drug treatment begins when cells are overlaid with 383 the agarose pad and is maintained throughout imaging . Cells were imaged at 45 minutes post - plating . 384 Drugs were first diluted down to 1000X in DMSO , then added to the agarose solution at a dilution of 385 Garner and Theriot , confidential manuscript 24 1 : 1000 ( for a final concentration of 30 nM for Latrunculin B and 100  M for CK - 666 ) , giving a final 386 DMSO concentration in the pad of 0 . 1 % . Controls were performed by adding 0 . 1 % DMSO to the agarose 387 pad alone . 388 389 Keratocyte isolation and motility assays . Keratocytes were cultured from wild - type zebrafish embryos at 390 two days post - fertilization as described previously 74 . Briefly , zebrafish embryos were collected at two 391 days post - fertilization , dechorionated , and anesthetized using tricaine . To dissociate the keratocytes , 392 dechorionated fish were then washed in PBS , incubated in Cell Dissociation Buffer for 30 min at 4 ˚ C , 393 incubated in a solution of 0 . 25 % trypsin and 1mM EDTA for ~ 15 min at 28 ˚ C , and then incubated in fetal 394 bovine serum to quench the trypsin . From this point on , cells were maintained in antibiotic and antimycotic 395 to deter microbial growth . The keratocyte - rich supernatant was then concentrated by centrifugation at 396 500g for 3 min . Keratocytes were then plated on collagen - coated coverslips and incubated at room 397 temperature for ~ 1 hr to allow cells to adhere . Once adherent , the supernatant was exchanged for imaging 398 media ( 10 % fetal bovine serum in L - 15 ) and allowed to incubate another 15 min at room temperature 399 before imaging . The keratocytes were imaged at 28 ˚ C under similar conditions as those used for HL - 60 400 cells . Data included in Fig . S6 represent cells from a single coverslip . Experiments were approved by 401 University of Washington Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee ( protocol 4427 – 01 ) . 402 403 Image segmentation . Most segmentation algorithms penalize curvature in the contour in order to reduce 404 the noise in the fitting algorithm 75 . However , this runs the risk of introducing artificial correlations and 405 structure into the data . For example , a spring - like curvature penalty would artificially make fluctuations 406 appear to be stretch - dominated . Therefore , we performed the following custom segmentation algorithm 407 to avoid these potential artifacts ( Fig . S1 ) . Phase contrast time - lapse videos were manually aligned to the 408 Garner and Theriot , confidential manuscript 25 direction of motion of the cell , such that each cell migrates up the y - axis on an x - y coordinate system 409 ( Fig . S1a - b ) . The videos were then cropped to isolate the cell leading edges and exclude the cell body , for 410 easier segmentation . If the cell migrates up the y - axis , this means every image pixel along the x - axis has 411 an associated leading edge position along the y - axis . A leading edge y - position was assigned to each x - 412 axis pixel independently of knowledge about neighboring x - axis pixels , to avoid injecting the artifacts 413 discussed above . A manual segmentation was performed for the first time point in each movie . A custom , 414 automated segmentation algorithm written in MATLAB then performed a line scan of the phase contrast 415 intensity along the y - axis separately for each pixel along the x - axis . For each line scan , the algorithm 416 performs a local search for the leading edge position , constrained to be within a fixed number of pixels 417 from either the manual segmentation ( for the first time point ) or the previous time point ( for subsequent 418 timepoints ) . The leading edge position is defined as the midpoint between the brightest phase intensity 419 ( phase halo ) and the point of steepest intensity gradient ( transition from phase halo to phase - dense 420 cytoplasm ) . 421 422 Preparation of the curvature and velocity kymographs . The curvature and velocity kymographs 423 ( Fig . 1b - c , Fig . S3 ) were prepared using custom MATLAB code . Curvatures are calculated as the inverse 424 radius of the best - fit circle corresponding to a 30 pixel - wide ( ~ 1 . 5 µ m ) region about each position . The 425 most prominent fluctuation events seen in the curvature kymographs ( Fig . 1b , Fig . S3 ) somewhat 426 correspond to ( but do not exactly match ) the length of the fitting window . For example , the simulated and 427 experimental data shown in Fig . S3 were fit using the same ~ 1 . 5 µ m fitting window and have similar 428 apparent “dominant wavemode s ” of ~ 3  m , or twice the fitting window . However , despite being fit with 429 the same fitting window , the simulated data has an observably smaller apparent “dominant wavemode” 430 Garner and Theriot , confidential manuscript 26 than the experimental data . Velocities were calculated as the distance traveled over 250 ms ( five 50 ms 431 timepoints ) non - overlapping windows . 432 433 Processing of segmented cell shapes for autocorrelation analysis . Kymographs of curvature and velocity 434 such as those shown in Fig . 1b - c , while helpful to obtain a qualitative sense of the fluctuation data , are 435 visually dominated by the largest size - scale features of the leading edge . They thus offer an incomplete 436 description of the shape fluctuations 43 – notably de - emphasizing the fine - scale features that are the subject 437 of this study . Further , curvature kymographs emphasize features that are approximately the same size as 438 the fitting window , and fail to pick up fluctuations at different size scales . To perform a quantitative 439 analysis which faithfully captures fluctuations at all size scales , we choose to perform Fourier 440 decomposition on the leading edge shape , and analyze the dynamics of each wavemode separately . As 441 cells migrate , their global leading edge shape undergoes long timescale changes , such as variations in 442 width , large - scale curvature , or slight turning of the cell , which can dominate the Fourier amplitudes and 443 the subsequent autocorrelation signal . As we are most interested in extracting the fine - scale fluctuations , 444 we performed background subtraction on the segmented leading edge shapes ( Fig . S2 ) . To do this , we 445 defined the “background” leading edge shape as the contour after smoothing ( by the lowess method , using 446 a span of 7  m ) . This rather large smoothing window was chosen specifically to preserve fine - scale 447 features . The background - subtracted y - position is thus defined as the difference between the segmented 448 leading edge and its smoothed counterpart . This process removed the large - scale features of the leading 449 edge . We next wanted to remove the long - timescale features of the leading edge , so we also subtracted 450 the time - averaged background - subtracted y - position for each x - pixel . Altogether , these pre - processing 451 steps maintained the features of interest in the curvature kymograph ( Fig . S3 ) . After performing 452 background subtraction , we still needed to control for changes in leading edge width over time . The 453 Garner and Theriot , confidential manuscript 27 wavelengths represented in the Fourier transform are defined as  = L / n , where L is the length of the leading 454 edge , and n is an integer from 0 to one half the number of pixels . If the leading edge length were to vary 455 over time , then so would the wavelengths , making it impossible to track the behavior of a single 456 wavelength fluctuation over time . We thus cropped the dataset along the x - axis to include only pixels 457 which contain the cell for all timepoints in the video , thereby extracting a fixed - length leading edge subset 458 for further analyses . 459 460 Autocorrelation analysis and fitting . 461 Autocorrelation analysis and fitting were performed separately for each cell and simulation . For 462 experimental data , the entire video was analyzed . For simulated data , analysis was only performed on the 463 time points after the simulation had reached steady state , for which we used a conservative cut - off of 10 464 sec ( see Fig . 2d - h ) . To separate out fluctuations at different length scales , we first performed a spatial 465 Fourier transform on the leading edge shape . Referencing the coordinate system defined in Fig . 2a , the 466 pixels ( experiments ) or membrane segments ( simulations ) are equally spaced in the x - direction , allowing 467 us to perform a one - dimensional Fourier transform ( MATLAB fft ( ) function , which assumes periodic 468 boundary conditions ) on the y - positions of a segmented leading edge for each time point . We then 469 normalize the Fourier transform by a factor of dx / √𝐿 , where dx is the pixel / membrane segment size and L 470 is leading edge length . This normalization preserves the variance and accounts for the pixel size . To 471 measure the fluctuation relaxation , we calculated the time - averaged autocorrelation ( A n ( τ ) = 472 < Y n ( t + τ ) ∙ Y n * ( t ) > t , using non - overlapping windows in t ) of each Fourier mode amplitude . The 473 autocorrelation function extracted from this analysis contains complex elements of the form A = a + ib . 474 We performed all plotting and fitting on the complex magnitude ( sqrt ( a 2 + b 2 ) ) of the autocorrelation 475 function , which is most representative of the total autocorrelation . 476 Garner and Theriot , confidential manuscript 28 Note that because we are plotting the complex magnitude ( which is always positive ) , the autocorrelation 477 plots shown in Fig . 1e - f and Fig . 2i - j are expected to decay to some non - zero background noise window , 478 rather than to zero . Indeed , the membrane simulation control ( see Validation of autocorrelation analysis 479 implementation ) , which is predicted to have a purely exponentially - decaying autocorrelation function , 480 also shows a decay to a noise window at long times ( Fig . S4 ) . We fit each Fourier mode time - 481 autocorrelation to the exponential decay function described in the main text ( Fig . 1f ) , fitting ln ( | A n ( τ ) | ) vs 482 τ to a line using MATLAB’s polyfit function , to extract fit parameters for each cell and simulation . Each 483 curve was fit out to a drop in the amplitude by a factor of e / 2 , or at least 10 points . To average fit parameters 484 over many cells , we controlled for cell - to - cell variability in leading edge length by binning the parameters 485 by spatial frequency , and then calculating summary statistics separately for each bin . 486 The spatial background subtraction performed on the leading edge shape ( discussed in Methods : 487 Processing of segmented cell shapes for autocorrelation analysis ) was necessary to extract the fine - scale 488 shape fluctuations studied in this work . This background subtraction is expected to remove fluctuations 489 with wavelengths larger than ~ 7 µm ( i . e . , reduce their amplitude to zero ) . For this reason , only 490 wavelengths less than 7 µm are plotted in Fig . 1e - h . We note that it is possible that fluctuations with 491 wavelengths less than , but near 7 µm might also have slightly reduced measured amplitudes ( i . e . , the shape 492 of the curve in Fig . 1g may artificially level off at low spatial frequency ) . However , any such effect would 493 be performed uniformly in time , and therefore is not expected to affect the measured temporal dynamics 494 ( Fig . 1h ) . Indeed , when we extend the span of our background subtraction by ~ 50 % ( up to 10  m ) , we 495 find that only the amplitude of the largest mode is altered ( slightly increased ) and the measured relaxation 496 timescales are not affected ( Fig . S5 ) . 497 498 499 Garner and Theriot , confidential manuscript 29 Validation of autocorrelation analysis implementation . 500 To validate our autocorrelation method , we analyzed control simulations of a membrane freely fluctuating 501 under Brownian motion in the absence of actin , and showed it recapitulates predictions from analytical 502 theory for this system ( Fig . S3 ) . These simulations were performed exactly as in the leading edge 503 simulations , using the same parameters , but without actin . The equation of motion used for membrane 504 segments in the control simulations , as well as a derivation of the associated autocorrelation function , can 505 be found in Appendix 2 . 4 . 4 : Choice of timestep . Interestingly , the curvature kymographs of these control 506 simulations exhibit striking visual features reminiscent of instabilities , dominant wavemodes , or 507 oscillations – and yet such effects are absent from this system by definition ( which we confirm 508 quantitatively using our autocorrelation method , Fig . S3 ) . This suggests that similar features in the 509 experimentally - measured curvature kymograph are also not indicative of instabilities , dominant 510 wavemodes , or oscillations , which we confirmed by autocorrelation analysis . 511 512 Modeling . Here we briefly describe the geometry and major elements of the model . Please see the 513 Appendix for a detailed description of the model and Tables S1 - S2 for a list of the chosen parameters . A 514 simulated patch of leading edge was modeled by a branched network of actin filaments stochastically 515 polymerizing towards a 2D strip of membrane , subject to periodic boundary conditions . The 2D strip was 516 discretized as membrane segments that are fixed in position along one axis and move only along the 517 direction of motion of the simulated cell . Stochastic , fixed time step Brownian dynamics simulations , 518 implemented with custom MATLAB code , were performed to update the membrane position and actin 519 network properties . Actin network growth evolved from constant rate Poisson processes for 520 polymerization , depolymerization , branching , and capping . Once polymerized , filaments were fixed in 521 position at their branch point of origin ( in the lab frame of reference ) , and did not undergo retrograde flow 522 Garner and Theriot , confidential manuscript 30 ( i . e . translation of the filament position opposite the direction of migration ) or translational diffusion . The 523 membrane strip was subject to forces of bending and stretching , drag from fluid viscosity , as well as the 524 force of actin 5 , 6 , 36 . Filaments apply force to the membrane segments according to the untethered Brownian 525 ratchet formalism 5 , in which filament pointed end positions are assumed to be rigidly connected to the 526 network ( via their branch point of origin ) and their barbed end positions are able to freely fluctuate . ( As 527 previously , we ignore the possibility of filament buckling due to the fact that lamellipodial filaments exist 528 in a sufficiently low - load , high branch density regime 5 , and experimental evidence shows no indication of 529 buckling 12 . ) We expanded this formalism ( which previously only considered filament fluctuations 530 perpendicular to the filament’s long axis ) to include all fluctuations of the filament along the filament’s 531 short and long axes . Each filament pushes the membrane segment that spans the growing tip’s x - position . 532 We note that the filament angles used to determine the filament forces on the membrane and presented 533 throughout this work are always calculated relative to the global average direction of motion of the leading 534 edge , rather than the local average membrane normal ( a simplifying approximation necessitated by the 535 discrete geometry and motivated by the shallow curvatures exhibited by cell leading edges ) . Control 536 simulations were run to verify that the leading edge fluctuation behavior described in this work was not 537 dependent on the temporal discretization ( i . e . , simulations were run with sufficiently small timesteps to 538 resolve the fastest dynamics , Fig . S7 ) , spatial discretization ( i . e . , simulations were run with sufficiently 539 short membrane segments to resolve the smallest length scales at which there is significant bending , Fig . S8 ) , 540 or leading edge length ( i . e . , the periodic boundary conditions were implemented correctly , such that a 541 simulated small patch of leading edge behaves identically to an equivalently sized portion of a larger 542 simulated patch of leading edge , Fig . S9 ) . In cases where membrane tension and bending rigidity were 543 removed , these forces were simply not calculated in the simulation ( Fig . 7a - e ) . To remove filament 544 spreading , we modified how the filament position was updated upon addition of a monomer in order to 545 Garner and Theriot , confidential manuscript 31 maintain the growing filament tip’s x - position . Addition of monomers contributed only to changes in the 546 barbed - end y - position , leaving the x - position intact , while updating the filament length correctly 547 ( effectively sliding the pointed end x - position backwards , rather than advancing the barbed end x - position 548 forwards , Fig . 7f - i ) . 549 Garner and Theriot , confidential manuscript 32 Table 1 .

In cartesian coordinates , the cell migrates in the x - y plane along the y - axis and maintains a fixed leading edge height of 200nm along the z - axis . The leading edge membrane was modeled as a 2D strip that restricts bending and stretching in the x - y plane and is perfectly flat along the z - axis . We discretized the membrane such that a 20 µ m leading edge membrane was modeled as 200 flat , rectangular segments ( each 100nm in length along the x - axis and 200nm in height along z - axis ) whose surface normal is fixed to lie along the y - axis . The membrane is implented using a Monge parameterization , such that these membrane segments are fixed in position along the x - and z - axes and move only along the y - axis ( the direction of motion of the simulated cell ) . 53 1 . 2 Updating the membrane position The membrane segments are assumed to move in a viscous medium at low Reynolds number , with drag force F drag = − γ ∂y∂t and Stoke’s drag coefficient γ = 6 πηr , where r is the membrane segment length ( x - axis ) and η is the dynamic viscosity of water . The membrane also acts under the forces of membrane bending and stretching ( F S / B , see Appendix section 1 . 3 ) , and Brownian ratchet forces by the actin filaments ( F BR , see Appendix section 1 . 4 ) . This gives us the following equation of motion . (cid:88) F = 0 = − γ ∂y ∂t + F S / B + N fil (cid:88) n = 1 F nactin ( 1 ) Brownian dynamics simulations , implemented with a 4th order Runge - Kutta algorithm , were performed to update the membrane segment positions . Thermal fluctuations of the membrane were ignored in this implementation , as thermal fluctuations of the ( much stiffer ) actin filaments dominate the membrane’s motion as well as monomer incorporation into the actin network ( Mogilner and Oster 1996 ) . See Appendix Detailed Derivations IV for a discussion of the numerical approximations included in the simulations . 1 . 3 Forces of membrane bending and stretching The simulated leading edge membrane acts under the energetic constrains of stretching and bending , characterized by the experimentally measurable parameters of membrane tension ( σ , pN · nm − 1 ) and bending modulus ( κ , pN · nm ) , and using the following energy functional : E S / B = (cid:90) (cid:90) σ 2 (cid:18) ∂y ∂x (cid:19) 2 + κ 2 (cid:18) ∂ 2 y ∂x 2 (cid:19) 2 dx dz = h (cid:90) σ 2 (cid:18) ∂y ∂x (cid:19) 2 + κ 2 (cid:18) ∂ 2 y ∂x 2 (cid:19) 2 dx ( 2 ) where h is the height of the leading edge in the z - dimension , ∂y∂x is extension of the membrane ( i . e . an increase in contour length ) , and ∂ 2 y ∂x 2 is curvature in ( bending of ) the membrane . The force of membrane stretching and bending on a single membrane segment ( F S / B ) is defined as the free energy gained by movement of the segment ( seg ) , and takes the following form . . . ( See Detailed Derivations I for a derivation of the functional derivative and resulting force . ) F S / B = − (cid:90) s eg δE S / B δy dx = σ eff ∂ 2 y ∂x 2 − κ eff ∂ 4 y ∂x 4 ( 3 ) 1 . 4 Actin filament Brownian ratchet forces Actin filaments constantly undulate due to thermal fluctuations , bending and stretching to sample their conformational space . The presence of the membrane restricts fluctuations of the filament past the membrane , presenting an entropic cost and a reduction in the free energy of the filament . The force of the filament exerted on the membrane segment , F actin , can therefore be calculated as the gain in free energy , G , by an infinitesmal movement of the membrane position , ξ : G = − k B T log Z conf ( 4 ) F actin = ∂G ∂ξ (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ξ = 0 ( 5 ) The partition function , Z conf , determined by the energetic cost of bending the filament , E bend , defines the conformational landscape . A few considerations must be made to determine the partition funciton in our system . Each filament applies force only to the membrane segment under which the filament’s barbed ( growing ) end equilibrium position sits , making the approximation that each membrane segment acts as an infinite wall past which filament fluctuations are blocked . Given this assumption , the membrane only restricts filament fluctuations along the y - axis . The partition function is therefore integrated over all x - positions , but only the subset of y - positions where the filament is not restricted by the membrane . With these considerations in mind , we arrive at our partition function : ( See Appendix Detailed Derivations II for a derivation of the filament bending energy and Detailed Derivations III for the derivation of the force . ) Z conf = (cid:90) ∞ −∞ (cid:90) ∞ 0 e − βE bend dy dx ( 6 ) 54 where y is measured relative to the membrane surface and β = 1 k B T . The final equation for the force of a filament on the membrane becomes . . . F actin = k B Te − 12 ¯ κ Eff y 20 (cid:82) ∞ 0 e − 12 ¯ κ Eff ( y − y 0 ) 2 dy ( 7 ) where y 0 is the equilibrium filament position measured relative to the membrane surface ( the filament pokes through the membrane for y 0 < 0 ) and ¯ κ Eff = (cid:18) ¯ κ ∥ ¯ κ ⊥ ¯ κ ⊥ cos 2 ( θ ) + ¯ κ ∥ sin 2 ( θ ) (cid:19) ( 8 ) and ¯ κ ⊥ = 3 L 2 N , ¯ κ ∥ = 16 L 2 N 2 , and N = Ll p for a filament with length L and persistence length l p at an angle θ relative to the membrane segment normal . 1 . 5 Actin network dynamics Actin network dynamics including polymerization , depolymerization , branching , and capping were assumed to be indepen - dent , constant rate Poisson processes . The choice of rates are described in their respective sections below . For a given time step of ∆ t and rate r , the probability of an event happening during any given time step is . . . p = 1 − e − r · ∆ t ( 9 ) where e − r · ∆ t is the probability that the event did NOT take place within a time step of ∆ t . A random number generator was used to determine which processes occurred in each time step . In particular , a random number was chosen between 0 and 1 . If the random number lied below the probability p , then the event occured . For each simulation the random number generator was seeded with a unique , semi - random number , based on the current time . 1 . 5 . 1 Polymerization and depolymerization The rate of polymerization was assumed to be r on = k on · M · p gap , where k on is the rate of polymerization per free monomer concentration in monomers ms − 1 µM − 1 , M is the free monomer concentration in µM , and p gap is the probability that enough space opens up in between the filament tip and the membrane to add a monomer ( such that the polymerization rate far away from the membrane is r ( y = ∞ ) = k on · M ) . Previously , it was determined that this probability is set by thermal fluctuations of the filament ( Mogilner and Oster , 1996 ) . In other words , the probability of adding a monomer is determined by the probability that thermal fluctuations , by chance , overcome the bending and stretching energies of the filament and bend the filament tip away from the membrane enough to open up a space of sufficient size to add a monomer . Given a monomer width ∆ , the probability of adding a monomer is . . . p gap = (cid:82) ∞ ∆ e − 12 κ Eff ( y − y 0 ) 2 dy (cid:82) ∞ 0 e − 12 κ Eff ( y − y 0 ) 2 dy ( 10 ) where κ Eff takes into account the thermal energy ( k B T ) as well as the flexibility , length , and orientation of the filament . Depolymerization was assumed to be a constant rate process with rate r off ( monomers ms − 1 ) , independent of membrane proximity . 1 . 5 . 2 Branching The rate of branching was calculated for each filament at each time step , such that r branch = k branch · M · l branch . Here k branch is the branching rate per free monomer concentration per length of mother filament in units of branches ms − 1 µM − 1 nm − 1 , M is the free monomer concentration in µM , and l branch is the length of the filament that sits inside the branching window . A fixed - length branching window is required for model stability , and is well - supported by experimental evidence that branching activation is localized to the leading edge membrane . Unlike linear polymerization , branching was not inhibited by membrane proximity . For simplicity , new branches were placed on the tip of the mother filament . If this placement caused the new branch tip position to extend past the membrane , then the branches were placed on the side of the mother filament such that the branch tip is flush with the membrane . The angle of the branch relative to the mother filament was randomly selected from a normal distribution with mean µ = θ branch and standard deviation σ = ∆ θ branch as specified for each simulation . The side of the mother filament on which the branch was placed was random . 1 . 5 . 3 Capping Capping was assumed to be a constant rate process with rate r c ( ms − 1 ) , independent of membrane proximity . Filaments were not allowed to uncap . Capped filaments were not allowed to polymerize or depolymerize . 55 1 . 5 . 4 Filament deletion Our simulations were intended to capture only leading edge actin dynamics . We therefore chose , for simulation efficiency , to only keep track of filaments actively applying force to the membrane . Filaments which were both 1 ) capped and 2 ) cumulatively provided less than 0 . 1 % of the force on a given membrane segment were deleted from the simulation . 2 Detailed Derivations This Detailed Derivations contains detailed derivations and clarifications for the material discussed in the previous section of the Appendix : “Detailed description of the model” . 2 . 1 Detailed Derivations I : Forces of membrane bending and stretching In this section , we use the energy functional for membrane elasticity defined in section 1 . 3 to calculate the elastic forces on a discrete membrane segment , filling in the steps of Appendix equation ( 3 ) . 2 . 1 . 1 Functional derivative of the membrane stretch / bend energy functional We can solve the functional derivative δEδy for our particular energy function ( Appendix equation ( 2 ) ) using the fact that for a functional of the following type . . . F [ ρ ] = (cid:90) f ( r , ρ ( r ) , ∇ ρ ( r ) , . . . , ∇ N ρ ) dr The functional derivative is calculated by . . . . δF δρ ( r ) = (cid:32) ∂f ∂ρ + N (cid:88) i = 1 ( − 1 ) i ∇ i · ∂f ∂ ∇ i ρ (cid:33) So for this particular energy functional E [ y ] = h (cid:90) σ 2 (cid:18) ∂y ∂x (cid:19) 2 + κ 2 (cid:18) ∂ 2 y ∂x 2 (cid:19) 2 dx ( 11 ) f ( x , y ( x ) , ∇ y ( x ) , . . . , ∇ N y ( x ) ) = h (cid:32) σ 2 (cid:18) ∂y ∂x (cid:19) 2 + κ 2 (cid:18) ∂ 2 y ∂x 2 (cid:19) 2 (cid:33) ( 12 ) δE δy ( x ) = h   − d dx df d (cid:16) ∂y∂x (cid:17) + d 2 dx 2 df d (cid:16) ∂ 2 y ∂x 2 (cid:17)   = h (cid:18) − d dx (cid:18) σ (cid:18) ∂y ∂x (cid:19)(cid:19) + d 2 dx 2 (cid:18) κ (cid:18) ∂ 2 y ∂x 2 (cid:19)(cid:19)(cid:19) = h (cid:18) − σ ∂ 2 y ∂x 2 + κ∂ 4 y ∂x 4 (cid:19) ( 13 ) Note that δEδy ( x ) is a functional derivative ( rather than an ordinary derivative ) , with units of a force per unit length ( rather than a force ) . Finally , we can calculate the total elastic force on a discrete membrane segment of length ∆ x , by integrating this force density over the length of a segment ( within which the spatial derivatives of y do not vary ) . F S / B = − (cid:90) seg δE S / B δy dx = − (cid:90) seg h (cid:18) − σ ∂ 2 y ∂x 2 + κ∂ 4 y ∂x 4 (cid:19) dx = h ∆ x (cid:18) σ ∂ 2 y ∂x 2 − κ∂ 4 y ∂x 4 (cid:19) = σ eff ∂ 2 y ∂x 2 − κ eff ∂ 4 y ∂x 4 ( 14 ) where σ eff = σh ∆ x and κ eff = κh ∆ x . 56 2 . 2 Detailed Derivations II : 2D thermal fluctuations of actin filaments In this section , we characterize the thermal fluctuations of an actin filament with a given length and persistence length ( and the associated bending modulus ) . We first decompose the fluctuations into their ( small ) end - to - end and ( larger ) side - to - side fluctuations , and then further perform a wavelength decomposition on the side - to - side fluctuations . We next apply the equipartition theorem , giving 12 k B T to each independent bending mode , to determine the fluctuation magnitude of each of these modes . We then determine the average total side - to - side and end - to - end fluctuation magnitudes , allowing us to calculate effective bending coefficients for the side - to - side ( κ ⊥ ) and end - to - end ( κ ∥ ) fluctuations . These effective bending energies will then be used in Detailed Derivations III to determine the force of a filament on a membrane segment . 2 . 2 . 1 Determining the wavelength - dependence of thermal fluctuations Assume we have a filament of length L , which , in the absence of thermal fluctuations , points vertically upward in the direction ˆ i . Due to thermal fluctuations , the actin polymer will fluctuate all along its length , as well as along the directions of both the short and long axis of the filament . At any point s along the polymer , we can define the local position vector ⃗r ( s ) , and the local tangent vector of the polymer ⃗t ( s ) = ∂⃗r∂s . Given a persistence length l p , and thus a bending modulus B = l p k B T , the bending energy E bend of a filament is defined as . . . E bend = B 2 (cid:90) L 0 (cid:18) ∂⃗t ∂s (cid:19) 2 ds βE bend = l p 2 (cid:90) L 0 (cid:18) ∂ ⃗ t ∂s (cid:19) 2 ds ( 15 ) where β = 1 k B T and ⃗t ( s = 0 ) = ˆ i . If we assume the thermal fluctuations are small ( Ll p < < 1 ) , then we can write the position vector along the polymer as . . . ⃗r ( s ) = J ( s ) ˆ j + ( s − δ ( s ) ) ˆ i ( 16 ) Then . . . ⃗t = ∂⃗r ∂s = ∂J ∂s ˆ j + (cid:18) 1 − ∂δ ∂s (cid:19) ˆ i ( 17 ) And . . . ∂⃗t ∂s = ∂ 2 J ∂s 2 ˆ j − ∂ 2 δ ∂s 2 ˆ i ( 18 ) Because ⃗t is the unit tangent vector , we know ⃗t · ⃗t = 1 . This allows us to solve for ∂δ∂s in terms of ∂J∂s . ⃗t · ⃗t = 1 = (cid:18) ∂J ∂s (cid:19) 2 + (cid:18) 1 − ∂δ ∂s (cid:19) 2 0 ≈ (cid:18) ∂J ∂s (cid:19) 2 − 2 (cid:18) ∂δ ∂s (cid:19) ∂δ ∂s ≈ 1 2 (cid:18) ∂J ∂s (cid:19) 2 ∂ 2 δ ∂s 2 ≈ ∂J ∂s ∂ 2 J ∂s 2 ( 19 ) Plugging this back into our equation for E bend . . . 57 βE bend = l p 2 (cid:90) L 0 (cid:18) ∂⃗t ∂s (cid:19) 2 ds = l p 2 (cid:90) L 0 (cid:18) ∂⃗t ∂s · ∂⃗t ∂s (cid:19) ds = l p 2 (cid:90) L 0 (cid:32)(cid:18) ∂ 2 J ∂s 2 (cid:19) 2 + (cid:18) ∂ 2 δ ∂s 2 (cid:19) 2 (cid:33) ds = l p 2 (cid:90) L 0 (cid:32)(cid:18) ∂ 2 J ∂s 2 (cid:19) 2 + (cid:18) ∂J ∂s ∂ 2 J ∂s 2 (cid:19) 2 (cid:33) ds ≈ l p 2 (cid:90) L 0 (cid:18) ∂ 2 J ∂s 2 (cid:19) 2 ds ( 20 ) By decomposing J ( s ) into its wavemodes , we can determine the relative amplitudes A n of thermal fluctuations at different lengthscales , where n refers to the specific wavemode . This choice of wavemode decomposition oscillates around √ 2 A n from 0 to 2 √ 2 A N ( ⟨ A n ⟩ = 0 ) , where the filament is pinned at zero at s = 0 and open at the other end .

We start by converting from the coordinate system used in Detailed Derivations II ( in the frame of the filament long axis ) to the reference frame of the membrane segment . We then use the bending energies to evaluate the partition function Z conf for a filament which is constrained by the membrane segment - and then use the partition function to determine the free energy G of the filament . Finally , we evaluate the force of the filament on the membrane segment ( F actin ) as the increase in filament free energy obtained by an incremental movement of the membrane ∂G∂ξ (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ξ = 0 . 2 . 3 . 1 Converting to the reference frame of the membrane segment We derived this bending energy function in the reference frame of the filament . However , our partition function , Z conf , will need to be integrated across the x - y coordinate system used in the rest of the paper . The energy function can be extended to an arbitrary filament orientation in a ⃗u 0 and tip position ⃗r relative to resting filament tip position ⃗r 0 = ( 0 , 0 ) in the following way : βE bend = 1 2 ¯ κ ⊥ (cid:0) ⃗r (cid:0) I − ( ⃗u 0 ⊗ ⃗u 0 ) (cid:1) ⃗r (cid:1) + 1 2 ¯ κ ∥ ( ⃗r · ⃗u 0 ) 2 ( 42 ) Taking a coordinate system centered around the equilibrium filament tip position and aligned with the membrane normal , a filament lying at angle θ relative to the membrane normal will have filament orientation vector ⃗u 0 = sin ( θ ) ˆ x + cos ( θ ) ˆ y and filament tip position ⃗r = x ˆ x + y ˆ y will having the following perpendicular and parallel displacements . . . 61 ⃗r · ⃗u 0 = xsin ( θ ) + ycos ( θ ) ( ⃗r · ⃗u 0 ) 2 = x 2 sin 2 ( θ ) + y 2 cos 2 ( θ ) + 2 xycos ( θ ) sin ( θ ) ( 43 ) and . . . ⃗r (cid:0) I − ( ⃗u 0 ⊗ ⃗u 0 ) (cid:1) ⃗r = ( ⃗r · ⃗r ) 2 − ( ⃗r · ⃗u 0 ) 2 = x 2 + y 2 − y 2 cos 2 ( θ ) − x 2 sin 2 ( θ ) − 2 xycos ( θ ) sin ( θ ) = x 2 cos 2 ( θ ) + y 2 sin 2 ( θ ) − 2 xycos ( θ ) sin ( θ ) ( 44 ) We arrive at the following bending energy as a function of the filament angle , relative to the membrane normal . βE bend = 1 2 ¯ κ ⊥ (cid:0) x 2 cos 2 ( θ ) + y 2 sin 2 ( θ ) − 2 xycos ( θ ) sin ( θ ) (cid:1) + 1 2 ¯ κ ∥ (cid:0) x 2 sin 2 ( θ ) + y 2 cos 2 ( θ ) + 2 xycos ( θ ) sin ( θ ) (cid:1) = (cid:18) ¯ κ ⊥ 2 cos 2 ( θ ) + ¯ κ ∥ 2 sin 2 ( θ ) (cid:19) x 2 + (cid:18) ¯ κ ⊥ 2 sin 2 ( θ ) + ¯ κ ∥ 2 cos 2 ( θ ) (cid:19) y 2 + (cid:18)(cid:18) ¯ κ ∥ 2 − ¯ κ ⊥ 2 (cid:19) 2 sin ( θ ) cos ( θ ) (cid:19) xy ( 45 ) The x - and y - components have been separated for ease of integration in the next section . 2 . 3 . 2 Simplification of the bending energy function Currently , the exponential being integrated is of the form (cid:82) ∞ −∞ (cid:82) ∞ 0 e − ax 2 + bxy − cy 2 dydx . We can re - write the integral in the form (cid:82) ∞ −∞ (cid:82) ∞ 0 e − ( dx + fy ) 2 − gy 2 dydx , to take advantage of the fact that (cid:82) ∞ −∞ e − ( x + c ) 2 dx = (cid:82) ∞ −∞ e − x 2 dx . To do this , we can complete the square : f ( x ) = ax 2 + bx + c = a (cid:0) x + b 2 a (cid:1) 2 + c − b 2 4 a βE bend = (cid:16) κ ⊥ 2 cos 2 ( θ ) + κ ∥ 2 sin 2 ( θ ) (cid:17) (cid:32) x + (cid:0)(cid:0) κ ∥ 2 − κ ⊥ 2 (cid:1) 2 ysin ( θ ) cos ( θ ) (cid:1) 2 (cid:0) κ ⊥ 2 cos 2 ( θ ) + κ ∥ 2 sin 2 ( θ ) (cid:1) (cid:33) 2 + (cid:16) κ ⊥ 2 sin 2 ( θ ) + κ ∥ 2 cos 2 ( θ ) (cid:17) y 2 − (cid:0)(cid:0) κ ∥ 2 − κ ⊥ 2 (cid:1) 2 ysin ( θ ) cos ( θ ) (cid:1) 2 4 (cid:0) κ ⊥ 2 cos 2 ( θ ) + κ ∥ 2 sin 2 ( θ ) (cid:1) = (cid:16) κ ⊥ 2 cos 2 ( θ ) + κ ∥ 2 sin 2 ( θ ) (cid:17) (cid:32) x + (cid:0)(cid:0) κ ∥ − κ ⊥ (cid:1) ysin ( θ ) cos ( θ ) (cid:1) (cid:0) κ ⊥ cos 2 ( θ ) + κ ∥ sin 2 ( θ ) (cid:1) (cid:33) 2 + (cid:32)(cid:16) κ ⊥ 2 sin 2 ( θ ) + κ ∥ 2 cos 2 ( θ ) (cid:17) − (cid:0) κ ∥ − κ ⊥ (cid:1) 2 sin 2 ( θ ) cos 2 ( θ ) 2 (cid:0) κ ⊥ cos 2 ( θ ) + κ ∥ sin 2 ( θ ) (cid:1) (cid:33) y 2 ( 46 ) Now looking just at the y 2 portion , we can determine an effective bending coefficient in the ˆ y direction . βE y 2 bend = 1 2 (cid:32)(cid:0) ¯ κ ⊥ sin 2 ( θ ) + ¯ κ ∥ cos 2 ( θ ) (cid:1) − (cid:0) ¯ κ ∥ − ¯ κ ⊥ (cid:1) 2 sin 2 ( θ ) cos 2 ( θ ) (cid:0) ¯ κ ⊥ cos 2 ( θ ) + ¯ κ ∥ sin 2 ( θ ) (cid:1) (cid:33) y 2 = 1 2 (cid:18) ¯ κ 2 ⊥ cos 2 ( θ ) sin 2 ( θ ) + ¯ κ 2 ∥ cos 2 ( θ ) sin 2 ( θ ) + ¯ κ ∥ ¯ κ ⊥ (cid:0) cos 4 ( θ ) + sin 4 ( θ ) (cid:1) ¯ κ ⊥ cos 2 ( θ ) + ¯ κ ∥ sin 2 ( θ ) − (cid:0) ¯ κ ∥ − ¯ κ ⊥ (cid:1) 2 sin 2 ( θ ) cos 2 ( θ ) ¯ κ ⊥ cos 2 ( θ ) + ¯ κ ∥ sin 2 ( θ ) (cid:19) y 2 = 1 2 (cid:32) ¯ κ ∥ ¯ κ ⊥ (cid:0) cos 4 ( θ ) + sin 4 ( θ ) (cid:1) + 2¯ κ ∥ ¯ κ ⊥ sin 2 ( θ ) cos 2 ( θ ) ¯ κ ⊥ cos 2 ( θ ) + ¯ κ ∥ sin 2 ( θ ) (cid:33) = 1 2 (cid:32) ¯ κ ∥ ¯ κ ⊥ (cid:0) cos 2 ( θ ) + sin 2 ( θ ) (cid:1) 2 ¯ κ ⊥ cos 2 ( θ ) + ¯ κ ∥ sin 2 ( θ ) (cid:33) y 2 = 1 2 (cid:18) ¯ κ ∥ ¯ κ ⊥ ¯ κ ⊥ cos 2 ( θ ) + ¯ κ ∥ sin 2 ( θ ) (cid:19) y 2 = 1 2 ¯ κ Eff y 2 ( 47 ) 62 Because ¯ κ ⊥ < ¯ κ ∥ , κ Eff has a maximum at θ = 0 and a minimum at θ = π 2 . In the limit where ¯ κ ⊥ < < ¯ κ ∥ , we find βE y 2 bend = 1 2 (cid:18) ¯ κ ⊥ sin 2 ( θ ) (cid:19) y 2 = 1 2 κ Eff y 2 ( 48 ) where κ Eff = 3 l p k B T L 3 sin 2 ( θ ) , agreeing with previous models ( Mogilner and Oster , 1996 , BiophysJ ) , except for the fact that we arrive at a prefactor of 3 rather than 4 , as we took into account all of the bending modes of the filament , rather than assuming bending of the filament lies along an arc of constant curvature - a difference also arrived at by Dickinson and colleagues ( Dickinson , Caro , and Purich , 2004 , BiophysJ ) . This gives us a final bending energy . . . βE bend = 1 2 (cid:18) ¯ κ ⊥ · ¯ κ ∥ ¯ κ Eff (cid:19) ( x + f ( y ) ) 2 + 1 2 ¯ κ Eff y 2 ( 49 ) 2 . 3 . 3 Calculation of the partition function Using these energies , we can determine the partition function , Z conf , summing over all possible positions of the filament . In this case , the filament can fluctuate freely along the x - axis , but cannot fluctuate past the membrane position along the y - axis . Here we define the membrane position d relative to the filament tip .

For this purpose , we used the error function . The denominator of Appendix equation ( 54 ) can be rewritten in terms of the error function in the following way . . . f denominator = (cid:90) ∞ 0 dy e − 12 ¯ κ Eff ( y − y 0 ) 2 = (cid:90) −∞ y 0 ( − d ¯ y ) e − 12 ¯ κ Eff ¯ y 2 = (cid:90) y 0 −∞ d ¯ y e − 12 ¯ κ Eff ¯ y 2 = (cid:90) 0 −∞ d ¯ y e − 12 ¯ κ Eff ¯ y 2 + (cid:90) y 0 0 d ¯ y e − 12 ¯ κ Eff ¯ y 2 = (cid:34)(cid:32) 1 2 (cid:114) π (cid:0) 12 ¯ κ Eff (cid:1) (cid:33)(cid:35) + 1 2 (cid:114) π 1 2 ¯ κ Eff Erf (cid:34)(cid:114) ¯ κ Eff 2 y 0 (cid:35) = (cid:114) π 2¯ κ Eff (cid:32) 1 + Erf (cid:34)(cid:114) ¯ κ Eff 2 y 0 (cid:35)(cid:33) ( 55 ) The error function appears in the equation as 1 + erf ( z ) , which can give inaccurate calculations when z < < 0 and 1 + erf ( z ) ≈ 0 . Therefore , in the low z regime ( z < 0 ) , we replaced 1 + erf ( z ) with erfc ( | z | ) . ( Because erf ( − z ) = − erf ( z ) , erf ( z ( z < 0 ) ) = − erf ( | z ( z < 0 ) | ) . It follows that 1 + erf ( z ( z < 0 ) ) = 1 − erf ( | z ( z < 0 ) | ) = erfc ( | z ( z < 0 ) | . ) The following cases are listed below for the relevant equations .

This was implemented as min ( 0 . 1 r actinmax , 1 r membmax ) . This timestep was calculated specifically for each simulation , depending on the parameters chosen . The timescales of the actin dynamics are set by the rates of polymerization , depolymerization , branching , and capping . To estimate the timescales of relaxation for membrane elastic forces , we calculate the relaxation timescales of the membrane fluctuating under Brownian thermal forces . ( We do this because we do not a priori have an analytical theory describing the shape profile of the actin dynamics . Importantly , the fact that our simulations are not affected by the timestep ( Fig . S3 ) provide evidence that we are sufficiently resolving all system dynamics using this approximation to set the timestep . ) For a membrane at low Reynolds number , we have the following equation of motion . 0 = − γ ∂y ∂t + σ eff ∂ 2 y ∂x 2 − κ eff ∂ 4 y ∂x 4 + ξ ( t ) ∂y ∂t = 1 γ (cid:18) σ eff ∂ 2 y ∂x 2 − κ eff ∂ 4 y ∂x 4 + ξ ( t ) (cid:19) ( 58 ) The random Brownian force is Gaussian distributed with mean µ = 0 and variance σ 2 = 2 γk B T and is defined by its autocorrelation function < ξ ( x , t ) ξ ( x ′ , t ′ ) > = 2 γk B Tδ ( t − t ′ ) δ ( x − x ′ ) ( 59 ) We are ultimately interested in the time evolution of wave mode solutions to this equation , so we first take the Fourier transform in order to solve for the amplitude of each wavemode . Using the following properties of the Fourier transform : F ( f ( x , t ) ) = F ( k , t ) = (cid:114) 1 L ∞ (cid:88) k = 1 cos (cid:18) 2 πkx L (cid:19) f ( x , t ) F (cid:18) d n f ( x , t ) dx n (cid:19) = (cid:18) i 2 πk L (cid:19) n F ( f ( x , t ) ) F (cid:18) d n f ( x , t ) dt n (cid:19) = d n dt n F ( f ( x , t ) ) we can re - write the equation in Fourier space as . . . dY ( k , t ) dt = 1 γ (cid:32) σ eff (cid:18) i 2 πk L (cid:19) 2 Y ( k , t ) − κ eff (cid:18) i 2 πk L (cid:19) 4 Y ( k , t ) + Ξ ( k , t ) (cid:33) = − Y ( k , t ) γ (cid:32) σ eff (cid:18) 2 πk L (cid:19) 2 + κ eff (cid:18) 2 πk L (cid:19) 4 (cid:33) + Ξ ( k , t ) γ = − Y ( k , t ) (cid:18) σ eff α γ + κ eff α 2 γ (cid:19) + Ξ ( k , t ) γ ( 60 ) where α = 2 πk L . The random Brownian force in Fourier space is Gaussian distributed with mean µ = 0 and variance 2 γk B T ∆ x as defined by its autocorrelation function . For a discrete system , a Fourier transform with normalization 1 √ N , where N is the number of discrete membrane segments in this case , preserves the variance and standard deviation of a vector 65 of normally distrbuted random values . Here , our normalization is 1 √ L in addition to integrating over the fixed segment length ∆ x , giving a final normalization of (cid:113) ∆ xN for the Brownian force Ξ ( k , t ) . The factor of 1 √ N preserves the variance , leaving the variance changed only by the multiplicative factor of ( √ ∆ x ) 2 = ∆ x . < Ξ ( k , t ) Ξ ( k ′ , t ′ ) > = 2 γk B T ∆ xδ ( t − t ′ ) δ ( k − k ′ ) ( 61 ) We can solve this equation using a Laplace transform . s ˆ Y ( k , s ) − Y ( k , 0 ) = − ˆ Y ( k , s ) (cid:18) σ eff α γ + κ eff α 2 γ (cid:19) + ˆΞ ( k , s ) γ ( 62 ) ˆ Y ( k , s ) = ˆΞ ( k , s ) γ + Y ( k , 0 ) s + (cid:16) σ eff α γ + κ eff α 2 γ (cid:17) ( 63 ) and then in inverse Laplace transform Y ( k , t ) = (cid:90) t 0 e − (cid:18) σ eff α γ + κ eff α 2 γ (cid:19) ( t − τ ) Ξ ( k , τ ) γ dτ + Z ( k , 0 ) e − (cid:18) σ eff α γ + κ eff α 2 γ (cid:19) t = (cid:90) t 0 e − Γ γ ( t − τ ) Ξ ( k , τ ) γ dτ + Y ( k , 0 ) e − Γ γ t ( 64 ) Using the properties L [ ( f ∗ g ) ( t ) ] = L (cid:20)(cid:90) t 0 f ( τ ) g ( t − τ ) dτ (cid:21) = F ( s ) · G ( s ) ( 65 ) and L [ af ( t ) ] = aF ( s ) ( 66 ) and L [ e − at · u ( t ) ] = 1 s + a ( 67 ) and L [ f ′ ( t ) ] = sF ( s ) − f ( 0 ) ( 68 ) Now that we have Y ( k , t ) , we can solve for for the time - autocorrelation function ⟨ Y ( k ′ , t ) Y ( k , 0 ) ⟩ . ⟨ Y ( k ′ , t ) Y ( k , 0 ) ⟩ = (cid:28)(cid:20)(cid:90) t 0 e − Γ γ ( t − τ ) Ξ ( k ′ , τ ) γ dτ + Z ( k ′ , 0 ) e − Γ γ t (cid:21) Y ( k , 0 ) (cid:29) = ⟨ Y ( k ′ , 0 ) Y ( k , 0 ) ⟩ e − Γ γ t ( 69 ) We know that ⟨ Y ( k ′ , 0 ) Y ( k , 0 ) ⟩ is non - zero only if k = k ′ . ⟨ Y ( k ′ , 0 ) Y ( k , 0 ) ⟩ = lim t →∞ ⟨ Y ( k , t ) Y ( k , t ) ⟩ ( 70 ) 66 lim t →∞ ⟨ Y ( k , t ) Y ( k , t ) ⟩ = lim t →∞ [ ⟨ Y ( k , t ) ⟩ ] 2 = lim t →∞ (cid:20)(cid:28)(cid:90) t 0 e − Γ γ ( t − τ ) Ξ ( k ′ , τ ) γ dτ + Z ( k , 0 ) e − Γ γ t (cid:29)(cid:21) 2 = lim t →∞ (cid:20)(cid:28)(cid:90) t 0 e − Γ γ ( t − τ ) Ξ ( k ′ , τ ) γ dτ (cid:29)(cid:21) 2 = lim t →∞ (cid:90) t 0 (cid:90) t 0 (cid:28) e − Γ γ ( t − τ ) e − Γ ( t − τ ′ ) Ξ ( k ′ , τ ) γ Ξ ( k ′ , τ ′ ) γ (cid:29) dτ ′ dτ = 1 γ 2 lim t →∞ (cid:90) t 0 (cid:90) t 0 e − Γ γ ( t − τ ) e − Γ γ ( t − τ ′ ) ⟨ Ξ ( k , τ ) Ξ ( k , τ ′ ) ⟩ dτ ′ dτ ′ = 1 γ 2 lim t →∞ (cid:90) t 0 (cid:90) t 0 e − Γ γ ( t − τ ) e − Γ γ ( t − τ ′ ) ( 2 γk B T ∆ xδ ( τ ′ − τ ) ) dτ ′ dτ = 2 γk B T ∆ x γ 2 lim t →∞ (cid:90) t 0 e − Γ γ ( t − τ ) (cid:18)(cid:90) t 0 e − Γ γ ( t − τ ′ ) δ ( τ ′ − τ ) dτ ′ (cid:19) dτ = 2 k B T ∆ x γ lim t →∞ (cid:90) t 0 e − Γ γ ( t − τ ) e − Γ γ ( t − τ ) dτ = 2 k B T ∆ x γ lim t →∞ (cid:90) t 0 e − 2 Γ γ ( t − τ ) dτ = 2 k B T ∆ x γ lim t →∞ e − 2 Γ γ t (cid:90) t 0 e 2 Γ γ τ dτ = k B T ∆ x Γ γ γ lim t →∞ e − 2 Γ γ t (cid:104) e 2 Γ γ t − 1 (cid:105) = k B T ∆ x Γ γ γ = k B T ∆ x Γ = k B T ∆ x σ eff λ + κ eff λ 2 = k B T ∆ x σ eff (cid:0) 2 πkL (cid:1) 2 + κ eff (cid:0) 2 πkL (cid:1) 4 = k B T σh (cid:0) 2 πkL (cid:1) 2 + κh (cid:0) 2 πkL (cid:1) 4 ( 71 ) by a variant of Fubini’s theorem (cid:32)(cid:90) b a f ( x ) dx (cid:33) 2 = (cid:90) b a f ( x ) f ( y ) dxdy and a property of the Delta function (cid:90) ∞ −∞ f ( x ) δ ( x − a ) dx = f ( a ) So finally . . . ⟨ Y ( k ′ , t ) Y ( k , 0 ) ⟩ = k B Tδ kk ′ σh (cid:0) 2 πkL (cid:1) 2 + κh (cid:0) 2 πkL (cid:1) 4 e − (cid:16) σ eff γ ( 2 πkL ) 2 + κ eff γ ( 2 πkL ) 4 (cid:17) t ( 72 ) From this equation , the rate of relaxation due to membrane elasticity is . . . r memb = σ γ (cid:18) 2 πk L (cid:19) 2 + κ γ (cid:18) 2 πk L (cid:19) 4 r memb max = σ γ (cid:18) 2 πN segments L (cid:19) 2 + κ γ (cid:18) 2 πN segments L (cid:19) 4 ( 73 ) 67
