Weinberg , June 24 , 2010 ( sent for review January 26 , 2010 ) The epithelial - to - mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) produces cancer cells that are invasive , migratory , and exhibit stem cell character - istics , hallmarks of cells that have the potential to generate meta - stases . InducersoftheEMTincludeseveraltranscriptionfactors ( TFs ) , such as Goosecoid , Snail , and Twist , as well as the secreted TGF - β 1 . Eachofthesefactorsiscapable , onitsown , ofinducinganEMTinthe human mammary epithelial ( HMLE ) cell line . However , the interac - tions between these regulators are poorly understood . Overexpres - sionofeachoftheaboveEMTinducersup - regulatesasubsetofother EMT - inducing TFs , with Twist , Zeb1 , Zeb2 , TGF - β 1 , and FOXC2 being commonly induced . Up - regulation of Slug and FOXC2by either Snail or Twist does not depend on TGF - β 1 signaling . Gene expression sig - natures ( GESs ) derived by overexpressing EMT - inducing TFs reveal that the Twist GES and Snail GES are the most similar , although the Goosecoid GES is the least similar to the others . An EMT core signa - turewas derived from the changes in gene expression shared by up - regulation of Gsc , Snail , Twist , and TGF - β 1 and by down - regulation of E - cadherin , loss of which can also trigger an EMT in certain cell types . TheEMTcoresignatureassociatescloselywiththeclaudin - low and metaplastic breast cancer subtypes and correlates negatively with pathological complete response . Additionally , the expression level of FOXC1 , another EMT inducer , correlates strongly with poor survival of breast cancer patients . cancer stem cells | Twist | Snail | FOXC1 T he epithelial - to - mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) is a process in which adherent epithelial cells shed their epithelial charac - teristics and acquire , in their stead , mesenchymal properties , in - cluding ﬁ broblastoid morphology , characteristic gene - expression changes , increased potential for motility , and in the case of cancer cells , increased invasion , metastasis , and resistance to chemo - therapy ( 1 , 2 ) . Recent studies have linked EMTs with both meta - static progression of cancer ( 3 – 5 ) and acquisition of stem - cell characteristics ( 6 , 7 ) , leading to the hypothesis that cancer cells that undergo an EMT are capable of metastasizing through their acquired invasiveness and , following dissemination , through their acquired self - renewal potential , which enables them to spawn the large cell populations that constitute macroscopic metastases . EMTs can be induced in vitro by exposing certain normal and neoplastic epithelial cells to various growth factors , including TGF - β 1 , hepatocyte growth factor , and PDGF ( 1 , 8 ) . Downstream of each of these growth factors and their cognate receptors lies an array of transcription factors ( TFs ) , each of which is capable , on its own , of inducing an EMT . These TFs include the homeobox protein Goosecoid ( Gsc ) ( 9 ) , the zinc - ﬁ nger proteins Snai1 ( Snail ) and Snai2 ( Slug ) ( 10 – 12 ) , the basic helix - loop - helix protein Twist1 ( Twist ) ( 3 ) , the forkhead box proteins FOXC1 ( 8 , 13 ) and FOXC2 ( 14 ) , and the zinc - ﬁ nger , E - box - binding proteins Zeb1 and Sip1 ( Zeb2 ) ( 8 , 15 ) . In addition to TFs , members of the miR - 200 family of micro - RNAs are down - regulated during an EMT ( 16 ) . This down - regulation results , in turn , in the up - regulated expression of several critical target genes , notably Zeb1 and Zeb2 . Expression of any one of these TFs or down - regulation of the miR - 200 family in an appropriate epithelial cell suf ﬁ ces to induce an EMT ( 17 , 18 ) . Moreover , many of these TFs are expressed concomitantly in the mesenchymal cells that have passed through an EMT . The over - lapping and unique contributions of each inducer to the EMT program have not been adequately explored . Recent microarray analyses have allowed strati ﬁ cation of clin - ical breast cancers into a large number of distinct subtypes , such as luminal , basal - like , and HER2 + ( 19 – 21 ) . Yet , other subtypes of tumors have recently been delineated by us and others ( 22 , 23 ) . Thesedistinctions haveproventobeuseful inpredictingresponses to therapy , time to metastasis , and survival . In the present study , we assayed gene expression signatures ( GESs ) in human mammary epithelial cells ( HMLE ) induced to undergo an EMT by expressing Gsc , Snail , Twist , or TGF - β 1 or by knocking down expression of E - cadherin ( 24 ) , and found that EMTs induced by these methods induce an overlapping set of changes in gene expression , which we term the “ EMT core sig - nature . ” We compared the EMT core signature with signatures that de ﬁ ne breast cancer subtypes and found a close association with the claudin - low and metaplastic breast cancer subtypes . Results Interaction of EMT - Related TFs as a Regulatory Network . To eluci - date the network of interactions between EMT regulatory factors , we ﬁ rst assessed the expression of known EMT inducers and the genes known to be regulated during EMT in various breast cancer cell lines . To do so , we assayed four breast cancer cell lines for expression of the following TFs known to promote EMTs : Gsc ( 9 ) , FOXC1 ( 8 , 13 ) , FOXC2 ( 14 ) , Zeb1 , Zeb2 ( 25 , 26 ) , Slug ( 10 , 27 ) , Snail ( 11 , 28 ) , and Twist ( 3 ) , as well as other genes associated with Author contributions : J .

Relative to the lu - minal epithelial cell line , MCF - 7 , the MDA - MB 231 , MDA - MB 435 , and SUM 1315 basal B cell lines consistently expressed higher levels of Snail , Slug , and Zeb2 , but not Gsc or FOXC1 ( Fig . 1 A ) . To further understand the interactions among EMT - inducing TFs , we tested how overexpression of a single EMT - inducing TF affects the expression of other TFs in this network , thereby estab - lishing an “ EMT interactome . ” To do so , we used immortalized HMLEcellsthatexpresshighlevelsofE - cadherinandlowlevelsof vimentin , similar to the MCF - 7 breast cancer cell line and con - trastingwith themoremesenchymalMDA - MB231andSUM1315 breast cancer cell lines ( Fig . S1 ) . HMLE cells were induced to undergo EMTs through overexpression of Gsc , Snail , Twist , or TGF - β 1 . We then used RT - PCR to con ﬁ rm the expression levels ofthese genes , aswell asvarious genes knownto beassociated with EMT programs ( Fig . 1 B and Fig . S2 ) . Among the EMT - inducing TFs , expression of FOXC2 , Slug , Zeb1 , and Zeb2 was consistently elevated in response to over - expression of Gsc , Snail , Twist , or TGF - β 1 , suggesting that these four genes operate downstream of Gsc , Snail , Twist , and TGF - β 1 in the EMT interactome ( Fig . 1 B and C ) . In contrast , Gsc was not up - regulated by overexpression of the other EMT inducers , suggesting an independent mode of transcriptional regulation ( Fig . 1 B ) . Recent ﬁ ndings have demonstrated that EMT programs can also be induced by inhibiting members of the miR - 200 family of microRNAs ( 17 , 18 , 32 ) . We wished to determine the location of these miRNAs in the EMT interactome . The miR - 200 family and Zeb transcription factors form a mutually inhibitory , double negative - feedback loop ( 16 – 18 , 33 ) . Consistent with a role for Zeb1 and Zeb2 in miR - 200 repression , all miR - 200 family mem - bers were repressed by the forced expression of either Gsc , Snail , Twist , or TGF - β 1 ( Fig . 1 D ) . These results reinforce the ﬁ ndings that in addition to interactions of the EMT - inducing TFs , re - pression of the miR - 200 family of microRNAs accompanies and participates in execution of the EMT program . A widely accepted model of the EMT during tumorigenesis proposes that TGF - β 1 , produced by the tumor microenvironment , promotes tumor progression by inducing expression of the EMT - inducing TFs ( 34 ) . Indeed , treatment of HMLE cells with TGF - β 1 for a period of 12 d induced an EMT ( 14 ) and the expression of a number of EMT - inducing TFs ( Fig . 1 B ) . We undertook to de - termine whether another type of feedback loop operated here , speci ﬁ cally whether induction of an EMT achieved by overex - pressing EMT - inducing TFs yields , in turn , the expression of TGF - β 1 . For this experiment , we measured the expression of TGF - β 1 mRNA by quantitative RT - PCR ( qRT - PCR ) in HMLE cells expressing either an empty vector control , Gsc , Snail , Twist , or TGF - β 1 . In all cases , expression of TGF - β 1 mRNA increased by more than 5 - fold compared with control cells ( Fig . 2 A ) . Because TGF - β 1 suf ﬁ ced to induce an EMT , we investigated whether the TGF - β 1 expressed in response to an EMT operates in an autocrine manner to induce and maintain expression of down - streamEMTeffectors , speci ﬁ callyFOXC2andSlug . BecauseSnail and Twist are known to induce a complete EMT , including ex - pression of FOXC2 , Slug , and TGF - β 1 , we blocked TGF - β 1 sig - naling in these cells using SM16 , a compound developed to inhibit the TGF - β 1 pathway by interfering with the type I receptor sig - naling ( 35 ) . As anticipated , treating HMLE cells expressing either an empty control vector , Snail , or Twist with SM16 signi ﬁ cantly reduced the levels of phosphorylated SMAD2 / 3 by 50 to 90 % , compared with DMSO ( Fig . 2 B ) . Under these conditions , neither Fig . 1 . Expression of EMT marker genes in breast cancer cell lines and nontransformed EMT - induced human mammary epithelial cells .

This ﬁ ndingindicatedthatinductionofan EMT by Snail or Twist does not depend on ongoing TGF - β 1 autocrine signaling and suggests , instead , that Snail and Twist can induce FOXC2 and Slug through alternative mechanisms , quite possibly involving only intracellular signaling . Hierarchical Clustering of GESs from EMTs Induced by Gsc , Snail , Twist , TGF - β 1 , and by Down - Regulating E - Cadherin . Because various inducers of EMT seemed to be capable of transactivating a com - mon set of downstream effectors , we extended these comparisons by determining the larger effects of these TFs on overall gene ex - pression within cells . We began by deriving individual GESs of the cells induced to undergo EMT by forced expression of Gsc , Snail , Twist , or TGF - β 1 , or by knocking down E - cadherin , and cata - loguing genes exhibiting at least a 2 - fold up - or down - regulation under any of the conditions of EMT induction . Cells in which E - cadherin was experimentally down - regulated were also included in these analyses , as we previously demonstrated that this alteration could also serve to induce an EMT in these cells ( 24 ) . We then performed hierarchical clustering of these GESs to measure their degree of similarity ( Fig . 3 A ) . Of the ﬁ ve methods used to induce EMTs in this analysis , Snail and Twist generated the most similar GESs , consistent with the fact that Twist is a direct target gene of the Snail transcription factor ( 36 ) , and Gsc showed the most distinct GES ( Fig . 3 A ) , consistent with the observation that Gsc was not induced by ex - pression of either Snail , Twist , or TGF - β 1 ( Fig . 1 B ) . Not surpris - ingly , expression of TGF - β 1 or knockdown of E - cadherin pro - ducedGESs thatdivergedslightly fromboth Snailand Twist , likely because of the fact that , even though either method induces an EMT , neither involves ectopic expression of a TF and , therefore , may affect its downstream targets less directly . EMT Core Signature . Localized paracrine signals arising in the tu - mormicroenvironment appear tobeimportantininducingan EMT in nearby cancer cells ; accordingly , only a minority of cells within a tumormay display characteristics of having entered into or passed through an EMT . These observations complicate attempts to id - entify groups of cells within a tumor that have undergone an EMT . For this reason , we sought to identify a GES common to several known EMT - inducing signals . Establishment of such a core signa - tureshouldproveusefulinthefutureforidentifyingthesmallsubsetofcellsthathaveundergoneanEMTwithinatumor , evenifsuchan EMT is induced by a currently unknown inducer of this program . To identify such a signature , we reanalyzed the microarray - based gene - expression changes from HMLE cells expressing Gsc , Snail , Twist , or TGF - β 1 or an siRNA targeting E - cadherin . We identi ﬁ ed an EMTcore signature consisting of 159 genes that were down - regulatedand87genesthatwereup - regulatedatleast2 - fold by all of these EMT - inducing signals ( Table S1 ) . Several of these gene - expressionchangeswerevalidatedbyqRT - PCR ( Fig . S3 ) . As expected , the epithelial adhesion molecule E - cadherin ( CDH1 ) was down - regulated in all samples and the mesenchymal markers N - cadherin ( CDH2 ) , vimentin , and the invasion - associated pro - tease , matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP2 ) , were commonly up - regulated ( Table S1 ) . In addition , Zeb1 , one of the TFs capable of orchestrating an EMT , was commonly up - regulated . Overexpression of Snail has been shown to down - regulate the expression of the cell - cycle protein cyclin D2 ( CCND2 ) ( 37 ) , and indeed we found that CCND2 was down - regulated in the EMT coresignature . CellsundergoinganEMTareknowntoberesistant to apoptosis ( 38 – 41 ) . Consistent with this ﬁ nding , the proapo - ptosis gene BIK was down - regulated in all samples . In addition , genes with a Zeb1 binding site present in their promoters were enriched in the set of genes down - regulated by EMT , including the gene discoidin domain receptor 1 ( DDR1 ) , which encodes an RTK involved in E - cadherin localization and distinguishes basal A from basal B cell lines ( 42 – 45 ) , and the gene follistatin ( FST ) , which is a TGF - β antagonist ( Tables S2 and S3 ) ( 46 – 48 ) . Contributions of EMT - Inducing TFs to Breast Cancer . We next at - tempted to use existing GESs of various types of breast cancer to uncover possible connections between the various TFs and breast cancer pathogenesis . We sought to understand the relatedness of individual EMT - inducers and their respective GESs to the gene - expression pro ﬁ les with individual breast carcinomas in a large ( 244 patient ) cohort of these tumors ( 49 ) . The gene - expression pro ﬁ les derived from many tumors displayed a high correlation to GESs derived from Gsc , Snail , Twist , and TGF - β 1 , but correlated less strongly with the signature derived from knocking down E - cadherin ( Fig . 3 B ) . As predicted from previous observations , tumors with a high correlation to the Snail GES also displayed a high correlation to the Twist GES . In addition , the gene - expression pro ﬁ les derived from each tumor in this dataset tend to correlate with the GESs derived from more than one EMT in - ducer . Moreover , theexpressionsignatureofindividualtumorsdid not make it possible to resolve between alternative mechanisms of EMT induction ( i . e . , Twist - , Snail - , TGF - β 1 - , or Gsc - induced EMT ) inthesebreastcancers . Nonetheless , theGESsofindividual EMT - inducers could be used to assay for the occurrence of an EMT in a breast tumor , even if the EMT was induced by a still - unknown inducer and activation of this transdifferentiation pro - gram occurred in only a minority of the cells within each tumor . Importantly , thepossibilitythatstromalelementswithinthetumor samples rather than the carcinoma cells themselves resulted in the detection of a mesenchymal GES could not be discounted . Correlation of EMT Core Signature with the Basal B , Claudin - Low , and Metaplastic Signatures . We also wished to determine how the EMT core signature relates to the GESs of various subtypes of breast cancer . We compared the mean expression values of genes up - or Fig . 3 .

S4 ) . This subtype is characterized by high vimentin expression and a stem cell - like expression pro ﬁ le ( 45 , 50 ) , similar to cells that have undergone an EMT ; in contrast , the signatures derived from the basal A and luminal subtypes ( 45 , 50 ) ( Fig . S4 ) were not closely related to the EMT core signature . We also measured the association of the EMT core signature to GESs derived from breast cancer subtypes de ﬁ ned by Hennessy et al . ( 23 ) and against the GES of a cohort of metaplastic tumors that had been previously analyzed using the same microarray platform ( 22 ) . The up - and down - regulated genes from the EMT core signature were also signi ﬁ cantly up - and down - regulated in both the metaplastic and claudin - low breast cancers , but not in other breast cancer subtypes ( Fig . 4 A and B ) . This ﬁ nding is consistent with recent reports that have linked low E - cadherin expression , indicative of passage through an EMT , to clinically encountered breast tumors of either the claudin - low or meta - plasticsubtype ( 22 , 23 ) . Because passage through anEMT hasalso been linked with acquisition of stem cell characteristics ( 6 ) , this suggests that the neoplastic cells in these tumors contain relatively high proportions of cancer stem cells . We also assayed the expression of the mRNAs encoding EMT - inducing TFs in breast cancers that had been classi ﬁ ed into basal - like , HER2 + , luminal , claudin - low , and metaplastic subtypes ( 22 , 23 ) . We found that the Snail , Slug , Zeb1 , Twist1 , and FOXC1 TFs were up - regulated in metaplastic tumors , and Zeb2 was most commonly up - regulated in claudin - low tumors ( Fig . 5 A ) . Both metaplastic and claudin - low tumor subtypes showed signi ﬁ cant down - regulation of E - cadherin mRNA expression ( CDH1 ) as well as claudin 4 ( Fig . 5 A ) . Although nearly all claudin - low tu - mors express high levels of Zeb2 , only half of these tumors con - comitantly expressed high levels of other EMT - inducing genes ( Snail , Twist , FOXC1 ) ( Fig . 5 A ) . Strikingly , nearly all basal - like breast tumors , but not luminal or HER2 + tumors , display consis - tently high expression of the EMT - inducer FOXC1 , which is known to be associated with increased cell motility and invasion and decreased expression of E - cadherin ( 13 ) ( Fig . 5 A and Fig . S5 ) . Correlation of Expression of an EMT - Inducer with Patient Survival . We anticipated that tumors expressing the EMT - associated genes would exhibit a poorer survival than tumors not expressing the EMT - associated genes . For this reason , we performed clinical prediction analyses on the breast tumors in the Netherlands Cancer Institute ( NKI ) and University of North Carolina ( UNC ) databases ( 49 , 51 ) , using the EMT core signature .

Wethereforepursued analternative hypothesis : thatexpression of individual genes capable of inducing an EMT , rather than multigene signatures , could predict patient survival . Although the expression of Gsc , Snail , Twist , or TGF - β 1 genes did not predict clinical outcome , high expression of the FOXC1 TF was indeed apowerfulpredictorofpoorclinicaloutcome . Thus , thosepatients whose tumors exhibited high levels of FOXC1 gene expression showed a signi ﬁ cantly poorer survival outcome ( Fig . 5 B ) . Al - though , FOXC1 was not induced by Gsc , Snail , Twist , or TGF - β 1 , expression of FOXC1 in immortalized , but nontumorigenic , hu - man mammary epithelial MCF12A cells has been shown to induce an EMT ( 8 , 13 ) . Recentreportshavelinked expressionofspeci ﬁ csetsofgenesto resistance to chemotherapy in breast cancer patients ( 52 , 53 ) . Using an M . D . Anderson Cancer Center study of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy with paclitaxel , 5 - ﬂ uorouracil , doxo - rubicin , and cyclophosphamide ( 54 ) , we asked if tumor gene - expression pro ﬁ les from patients that had a pathological complete response ( pCR ) correlated with the EMT core signature . We found that gene - expression pro ﬁ les from patient tumors with pCR showed a negative correlation to the EMT core signature , whereas GESs from tumors from patients without pCR showed a slightly positive correlation to the EMT Core Signature ( Fig . S6 ) . Discussion The EMT core signature that we have identi ﬁ ed was generated by comparing the gene - expression changes that occurred by overexpressing either Gsc , Snail , Twist , or TGF - β 1 , or by re - ducing levels of E - cadherin . As we found , this signature is en - riched for genes containing the Zeb1 transcription factor - binding site near their transcription start sites ( Table S2 ) , and is most similar to GES from claudin - low and metaplastic breast cancers , as well as cancers without pCR . Of note , a recent study demonstrated that the GES obtained from normal mammary epithelial stem cells is most similar to the claudin - low signature ( 55 ) . This ﬁ nding is consistent with the present ﬁ ndings that the expression changes associated with the EMT - inducing TFs correlate most closely with the claudin - low and metaplastic breast cancers and with our earlier demonstration that passage through an EMT results in the acquisition of stem - cell characteristics ( 6 ) . Analysis of mRNA expression levels in cells overexpressing EMT - inducers reveals that Twist , Snail , and TGF - β 1 each up - regulate expression of Foxc2 , Zeb1 , and Zeb2 ( Fig . 2 C ) . Fur - thermore , we demonstrate that Snail and Twist generate the most closely related GESs , and expression of TGF - β 1 , Gsc , and knock - down of E - cadherin generate quite distinct , less closely related signatures . Further exploration of the differences between these various GESs will likely yield insights into the mechanisms re - quired to activate the EMT program and those involved in main - taining the resulting mesenchymal / stem cell state . Surprisingly , we were unable to observe any correlation between expression of genes in the EMT core signature and a poorer sur - vival outcome among breast cancer patients , despite the observa - tion that the EMT core signature correlates with metaplastic tumors , which are themselves linked with poorer patient survival ( 56 ) . Interestingly , arecentreportbyCreightonetal . foundthatthe GESderivedfrom breasttumor - initiatingcellswasalsoenrichedin claudin - low tumors , but likewise did not serve as a useful prog - nostic marker for clinical progression ( 53 ) . However , they found that cell populations that survive conventional chemotherapeutic treatment are enriched for cells with EMT - associated mesenchy - mal and stem cell - associated tumor - initiating features ( 53 ) . Addi - tionally , an association between EMT and chemotherapy resistance , rather than survival , is suggested by Farmer et al . , who show that a stroma - related GES predicts shorter relapse - free sur - vival among patients who received chemotherapy , but not among untreatedbreastcancerpatients ( 52 ) . These ﬁ ndingsareconsistent with our data indicating that gene expression pro ﬁ les of tumors frompatientsthatrespondedtochemotherapycorrelatenegativelywiththeEMTcoresignature . The use of total mRNA isolated from entire tumors for an - notation of the expression datasets may preclude detection of cells that have undergone EMT , as only a small proportion of the neoplastic cells in each tumor may exhibit an EMT phenotype . Poor - prognosis tumors may therefore harbor an insuf ﬁ cient num - ber of cells with a mesenchymal phenotype , so that there is no detectable effect on the gene - expression pro ﬁ le of the tumor as a whole . Accordingly , it may be necessary to collect tumor cells at the invasive edges of tumor cell islands and analyze these for the expression of the EMT - associated genes to gauge the true ma - lignant potential of the tumor as a whole . AmongthegroupofEMT - inducing genesstudiedhere , FOXC1 expression most closely correlates with a poorer survival of the breast cancer patients in the NKI and UNC datasets ( Fig . 5 B ) . FOXC1 was highly expressed in metaplastic and basal - like breast cancersubtypes ( Fig . 5 A ) , forwhichhighlyeffectivetreatments are not currently available . The closely related FOXC2 TF is known to play a key role in inducing an EMT , promoting metastasis and to be associated with aggressive basal - like breast cancers as studied using immunohistochemistry methods ( 14 ) . However , expression of FOXC2 could not be correlated with survival in the cited microarray - based strati ﬁ cation of breast cancer patients , because the arrays used did not contain suitable FOXC2 probes . Given the consistently high levels of FOXC1 in basal - like and metaplastic breast cancer subtypes , the high levels of Zeb2 in claudin - low breast cancers , and the contribution of FOXC2 to basal - like breast cancer ( 14 ) , these genes or the pathways that regulate these genes would seem to represent potential targets for the development of novel anticancer therapeutics . Methods RT - PCR . RNA was prepared from cultured cells by TRIzol extraction ( Invi - trogen ) . Complementary DNA was synthesized using Moloney Murine Leu - kemia virus reverse transcriptase ( Invitrogen ) . Relative quanti ﬁ cation values were calculated using the ddCt method ( 57 ) and values were plotted with SD using GraphPad Prism v5 . 0 ( GraphPad Software , Inc . ) . Cell Culture . Immortalized HMLE were grown as previously described ( 58 ) . MCF - 7 , SUM1315 , and MDA - MB 231 cells were maintained according to ATCC instructions . The SUM159 cell line used for the study was developed from pleural effusions of breast cancer patients ( 59 ) . SUM159 cells were cultured in F - 12 Hams ( Gibco ) supplemented with 5 % FBS ( Tissue Culture Biologicals ) , 5 μ g / mL of insulin , and 1 μ g / mL hydrocortisone at 37 °C in 5 % CO 2 . Microarray Data Analysis and Deposition . Microarray data for HMLE shCDH1 and vector control were extracted from the Gene Expression Omnibus ( GEO ) database under the accession GSE9691 . Microarray data for HMLE Gsc , Snail , Twist , TGF - β 1 , and vector control has been deposited in GEO under accession number GSE9691 . To compare gene expression among different EMT inducers , a heat map was generated using genes with at least a 2 - fold change in at least one condition included intheclustering . Tocompare individual EMT signatures to breast cancer patient gene - expression data , a heat map showing correla - tions between gene - expression pro ﬁ les of the EMT inducers and the gene - expression pro ﬁ les of tumors from breast cancer patients in the UNC cohort was created . Pearson correlation coef ﬁ cients were calculated between the gene - expression pro ﬁ les of all EMT inducer - patient pairs . Signi ﬁ cance Analysis of Microarrays . The list of up - and down - regulated EMT genes was derived using Signi ﬁ cance Analysis of Microarrays and cut off at the top 1 , 155 probes , 544 up and 611 down . The genes in the dataset were thenextractedandaveragedineachsample ( upanddownseparately ) . ANOVA was performed and boxplot graphs were plotted with gene expression using GraphPad Prism v5 . 0 ( GraphPad Software , Inc . ) . The one - way ANOVA for each plot was P < 0 . 0001 . Taube et al .

We used 1 μ g of total RNA to prepare complementary DNA ( cDNA ) using the Genechip HT One - Cycle cDNA synthesis Kit ( Affymetrix 900687 ) and the GeneChip HT IVT Labeling Kit ( Affymetrix 900688 ) . Total RNA was ﬁ rst re - verse transcribed using a T7 - Oligo ( dT ) promoter primer .

The in vitro transcription re - action was carried out in the presence of T7 RNA polymerase and a biotinylated nucleotide analog / ribonucleotide mix for cRNA ampli ﬁ cation and biotin labeling . The biotinylated cRNA targets were then cleaned up , fragmented and hybridized to Affymetrix HT - HG U133 A peg arrays ( Affymetrix 900751 ) . The hybridiza - tion and subsequent washing and staining was performed on the Affymetrix GeneChip Array Station automation platform . Arrays with signal intensity < 100 failed because of high noise and high background . Samples with percent presents within the range of 40 to 60 % of genes present and GAPDH and β - actin ratios less than 3 passed and were incorporated in the analysis .

Genes with at least 2 - fold up - ordown - regulation in all ﬁ veepithelial - to - mesenchymal trans - ition ( EMT ) conditionswerecollectedandtheirfold - changeswere averaged to generate an EMT pro ﬁ le .

Average correlation values of patients annotated as “ pCR ” were compared with those annotated as “ non - pCR ” with a Welch t test . Gene Set Enrichment Analysis . Gene set enrichment analysis was performed using Genepattern ( http : / / broad . mit . edu / cancer / soft - ware / genepattern / ) ( 2 , 3 ) . The rank order of genes from human mammary epithelial ( HMLE ) cell lines in two biological states , mesenchymal versus epithelial controls , was compared with gene sets within the molecular signatures database and signi ﬁ cant en - richments reported .
