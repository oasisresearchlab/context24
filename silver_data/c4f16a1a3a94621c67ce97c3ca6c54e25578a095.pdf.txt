Being conscious means that one is having an experience — the subjective , phenomenal ‘what it is like’ to see an image , hear a sound , think a thought or feel an emotion . Although our waking experiences usually refer to the external world , we continue to be conscious when we day - dream and during those periods of sleep when we dream 1 . Consciousness only vanishes during dreamless sleep or under general anaesthesia when , from our own intrinsic perspective , everything disappears and we experience nothing 1 . Understanding the origin of consciousness , how it fits into a physical account of the universe and its relationship with the body are long - standing questions in philosophy , psychology and brain science . It has been known for a long time that being con - scious requires the proper functioning of midline brain structures and that the particular contents of an exp eri - ence are supported by the activity of neurons in parts of the cerebral cortex 2 . The research strategy to iden - tify the neural correlates of consciousness ( NCC ) involves relating behavioural correlates of consciousness to the neural mechanisms underlying them . There has been considerable progress in this area since the subject was last reviewed in this journal 3 . In this Review , we start by outlining some contemporary approaches used to characterize the NCC , including the no - report paradigm . This work has led to a shift in our understanding of the location of the NCC , away from a broad fronto - parietal network towards a more restricted posterior cortical hot zone . We discuss how two popular candidate physio - logical markers of consciousness — gamma activity and the P3b wave — have not shown any predictive power and how other promising quantitative indices of con - sciousness have been developed . We outline the inher - ent limits of such an empirical research programme . This Review focuses on visual and auditory studies ; for accounts of the NCC for metacognition , body , tactile and olfactory experiences , see REFS 4 – 7 . Behavioural correlates of consciousness Although experiences are private , we can usually infer that people are conscious if they are awake and act purpose - fully , in particular if they can report what they experience and if that report accords with what is experienced by others . In a clinical setting , simple behavioural criteria are often used to infer consciousness , such as the ability to respond to a command ( for example , patients may be asked to squeeze the observer’s hand twice if they feel pain ) . The level of consciousness 2 , 8 is typically assessed by assigning a rating to a subject’s auditory , visual , verbal and motor functions using standardized scales ( such as REF . 9 ) . However , consciousness can be present even in the absence of reliable behavioural responses . For exam - ple , minimally conscious patients can be misclassified as being in a non - conscious , vegetative state , with significant clinical , practical and emotional consequences , if careful and repeated assessments are not carried out 10 , 11 . In an experimental setting , the content of con - sciousness is typically evaluated by verbal report or by button - press by the participant in response to a yes or no question ( such as “did you see a face ? ” ) . Such reports can vary , however , as a result of criterion shifts about what counts as seen for that individual participant , especially when the content is at or near perceptual thresholds 12 . Forced - choice procedures during such report tasks 13 can establish whether a participant detects or discriminates a stimulus above chance levels , and so determine whether they are objectively aware of it . For example , patients with lesions in their visual cortex may report that they 1 Allen Institute for Brain Science , Seattle , Washington 98109 USA . 2 Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences ‘Luigi Sacco’ , University of Milan , Milan , Italy . 3 Instituto Di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico , Fondazione Don Carlo Gnocchi , Milan , Italy . 4 Department of Neurology , University of Wisconsin , Madison , Wisconsin 53719 , USA . 5 Department of Psychiatry , University of Wisconsin , Madison , Wisconsin 53719 , USA .

Neural correlates of consciousness : progress and problems Christof Koch 1 , Marcello Massimini 2 , 3 , Melanie Boly 4 , 5 and Giulio Tononi 5 Abstract | There have been a number of advances in the search for the neural correlates of consciousness — the minimum neural mechanisms sufficient for any one specific conscious percept . In this Review , we describe recent findings showing that the anatomical neural correlates of consciousness are primarily localized to a posterior cortical hot zone that includes sensory areas , rather than to a fronto - parietal network involved in task monitoring and reporting . We also discuss some candidate neurophysiological markers of consciousness that have proved illusory , and measures of differentiation and integration of neural activity that offer more promising quantitative indices of consciousness .

This paradigm allows the neural correlates of consciousness to be distinguished from events or processes that are associated with , precede or follow conscious experience . Hot zone A temporo - parietal - occipital zone of the posterior cerebral cortex where the best current anatomical candidates for full and content - specific neural correlates of consciousness in the human brain are located . The content - specific neural correlates of consciousness may be any particular subset of neurons within this hot zone that supports specific phenomenological distinctions , such as faces . Vegetative state A disorder of consciousness that occurs in some patients with brain injury . The patients remain unresponsive and show no purposeful behaviour , but retain the ability to spontaneously open their eyes and maintain autonomic reflexes . Content - specific NCC ( Content - specific neural correlates of consciousness ) . The neural substrate supporting a particular content of experience ( for example , faces ) whether seen , dreamt or imagined . Transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) . A method of non - invasive brain stimulation , in which a magnetic field is induced by an electrical current in a coil placed onto the skull to induce neuronal activity in the underlying cortex . Full NCC ( Full neural correlates of consciousness ) . The neural substrate supporting experience in general , irrespective of its specific content . are unaware of a visual stimulus ( a subjective measure ) , while performing above chance in tests requiring stimulus detection ( an objective measure ) , a phenomenon referred to as blindsight 14 , 15 . A more refined way of characterizing experience is to use a perceptual awareness scale 16 , which ranges from “no experience” , to “brief glimpse” , “almost clear image” and “absolutely clear image” . Participants can also rate con - fidence in their judgement using a scale that runs from “completely guessing” to “fully confident” , or by making an economic judgement following each response ( referred to as post - decision wagering ) . When such report proto - cols are implemented judiciously , subjective and objective measures of consciousness are in concordance with each other 17 . The use of paradigms that include such confidence measures has been extended to non - human species 18 – 20 . Neural correlates of consciousness The NCC are defined as the minimum neuronal mech - anisms jointly sufficient for any one specific conscious percept 21 , 22 . There are two possible interpretations of this definition , depending on whether we are referring to the specific content of consciousness or to the overall state of being conscious . The content - specific NCC are the neurons ( or , more generally , neuronal mechanisms ) , the activity of which determines a particular phenomenal distinction within an experience . For example , the NCC for experiencing the specific content of a face are the neurons that fire , on a trial - by - trial manner , whenever a person observes , imagines or dreams a face , and are silent in other circum - stances 22 . When the content - specific NCC neurons in this example are activated artificially — for example , by transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) , electrical stimula - tion or optogenetic stimulation — the participant should see a face even if none is present , whereas if their activity is blocked , the participant should not be able to see a face even if one is present . The full NCC , as defined here , are the neural substrates supporting conscious experiences in their entirety , irre - spective of their specific contents . This is the union of the sets of content - specific NCC for all possible contents of experience . It is also important , both conceptually and empirically , to distinguish between the NCC and the background conditions for being conscious . These are factors that enable consciousness without contributing directly to its content , such as appropriate glucose and oxygen lev - els , an appropriate neuromodulatory milieu and afferent inputs that ensure adequate cortical excitability . Identifying the content - specific NCC . To identify the content - specific NCC , neural activity when a particular stimulus ( such as a face ) is perceived is compared with neural activity when that stimulus is not perceived 23 , with the sensory stimulus and the overall state of the par - ticipant kept constant under both circumstances ( FIG . 1a ) . Classic report - based visual paradigms to identify the content - specific NCC include binocular rivalry 24 , inter - ocular suppression 25 , bi - stable perception ( such as the Necker cube test , face - vase test and the Mooney face test 26 ) and various visual masking techniques ( such as forward and backward masking 27 and metacontrast masking 28 ) . Such report - based paradigms have revealed that a broad fronto - parietal network is activated during visual – motor tasks that contrast perceived stimuli with invisible stimuli . It has become clear , however , that at least part of the neural activity that co - varies with the perception of a par - ticular conscious content reflects processes that precede or follow the experience — such as selective attention , expec - tation , self - monitoring , unconscious stimulus processing , task planning and reporting 29 – 32 — rather than the expe - rience itself . Recent experimental paradigms have been designed to address these issues . To distinguish the true , content - specific NCC from neural activity that is merely a prerequisite for consciousness , factors that modify consciousness thresholds ( such as stimulus expectation , adaptation , working memory or the allocation of atten - tion ) are varied systematically 32 , 33 . This can be achieved by matching performance 33 , manipulating task relevance 34 or using a no - report paradigm 33 , 35 during which participants do not make any overt report , such as speaking or pushing a button ( FIG . 1b ) . For example , a recent study using binoc - ular rivalry 36 showed that eye movements and pupil dila - tion correlate tightly with conscious reports of perceptual dominance using a standard button - push paradigm . Eye movements and pupil dilation alone subsequently acted as proxies for the participants’ reports during sessions in which the NCC were identified by functional MRI ( fMRI ) while the participants viewed the stimuli passively 36 . Such no - report paradigms identify a more restricted content - specific NCC , which typically includes posterior cortical areas but not the prefrontal cortex . Identifying the full NCC . The neural mechanisms that are jointly sufficient for being conscious in a broad sense , irrespective of the particular contents of experience , are usually identified through state - based approaches . These involve contrasting brain activity when consciousness is present , typically in awake healthy participants per - forming no task , with brain activity when consciousness is severely diminished — for example , during dreamless sleep 37 , 38 ( FIG . 1c ) , general anaesthesia 39 , 40 or disorders of consciousness such as coma and vegetative states ( also known as unresponsive wakefulness syndromes ) 41 , 42 . Similar to findings from studies of content - specific NCC , such studies of the full NCC often find that a fronto - - parietal network is activated when one is conscious . How ever , it is important to note that major changes in the physiological state of the brain alter not only con - sciousness but also several other brain functions , such as vigilance and attention , that depend on levels of arousal - promoting neuromodulators 43 . One approach to address these confounds is to use a within - state , no - task paradigm , taking advantage of spontaneous fluctuations of consciousness . For exam - ple , during sleep , participants are disconnected from the environment and are not performing a task 44 ( FIG . 1d ) . If awakened from the same behaviourally defined state , such as non - rapid eye movement ( NREM ) sleep , participants at times report that they were having conscious experi - ences ( dreams ) and at other times that they were uncon - scious .

Binocular rivalry An experimental paradigm used to evoke bi - stable percepts in which one image is presented to the left eye of the participant and a different image is presented to the right eye ; rather than seeing a juxtaposition or fusion of both images , participants see one or the other object alternately . Coma A disorder of consciousness occurring in some patients with brain injury , in which the patient remains in an enduring , sleep - like state of immobility and unresponsiveness , with their eyes closed , from which they cannot be aroused . during sleep ( either NREM or REM sleep ) preceding retrospective reports of consciousness and unconscious - ness can then be contrasted within the same physiologi - cal state . Such experiments indicate that , in both NREM and REM sleep , the full NCC appear to be localized to a temporo - parieto - occipital region associated with per - ceptual experiences and to a frontal region associated with thought - like experiences 44 . High - frequency activity in the posterior cortical regions predicts the perceptual categories experienced during dreaming , such as faces , spatial setting , movements and speech 44 . The posterior cortical zone identified through this within - state , no - task paradigm largely overlaps with the union of cortical areas identified in studies of content - specific NCC during waking and with neuropsychological evidence . Because of this converging evidence , the posterior cortical region can be considered as a hot zone for the NCC . Neuroanatomy Subcortical structures . Many brain regions , despite having a large number of neurons , an intricate architec - ture and plentiful inputs and outputs , do not contribute directly to the content of our experiences . For example , the cerebellum has four times more neurons than the Figure 1 | Identifying the neural correlates of consciousness . This schematic diagram illustrates the absolute levels of brain activity across different conditions designed to identify the neural correlates of consciousness ( NCC ) . a | Haemodynamic activity in a report - based paradigm in which the experience of seeing a face or other stimulus manipulations such as backward masking is contrasted with not seeing it as a result of image noise 142 . The participant presses a button to report seeing ( yes ) or not seeing ( no ) the face . This isolates the brain regions involved in conscious face recognition , a content - specific NCC , but also the regions involved in the maintenance of the face in working memory and access to the concept ‘face’ for decision making . Note that the background conditions for consciousness , such as an active reticular activating system , are eliminated by this contrast . b | Haemodynamic activity in a no - report , seen / not seen paradigm , similar to part a , in which the participants do not report on their percept during the trial . Instead , either retrospective reports or physiological indicators , such as eye movements or pupil dilation , are used to avoid confounds related to the act of reporting 34 , 36 . This allows the content - specific NCC to be isolated . The union of all such content - specific NCC constitutes the full NCC . c | In a between - states paradigm , the haemodynamic activity associated with the experience of seeing anything ( here the experience of seeing pure black ) while awake is contrasted with the activity associated with the condition of no experience that would occur during dreamless sleep 37 . This analysis identifies brain regions involved in having any conscious experience , but also regions that mediate being awake rather than being asleep . d | In a within - state , no - task paradigm , participants are awakened at random during sleep ( stage N2 ) and are asked whether , before they were awakened , they were dreaming and , if so , about what . This paradigm identifies brain activity associated with having dream experiences up to 20 s before awakening 44 — a candidate for the full NCC of dreaming consciousness — and avoids confounds associated with task execution and state change .

Lesions of the cerebellum have little effect on consciousness and its contents , however 47 . A recent report described a woman with complete cerebellar agenesis and mostly preserved cognitive functions 48 . By contrast , brainstem lesions typically cause imme - diate coma 2 by damaging the reticular activating system 49 and its associated neuromodulatory systems 50 . However , neurological patients with a severely damaged cortex , but with relatively spared brainstem function , typically remain in a vegetative state . This suggests that brainstem activity is insufficient to sustain consciousness in a clinical sense 2 ( but see REF . 51 ) . Rather , it is likely that the activity of hetero geneous neuronal populations within the brain - stem , hypothalamus and basal forebrain , which project diffusely to thalamic and cortical neurons and promote their depolarization , provides an important background condition for enabling consciousness by facilitating effec - tive interactions among cortical areas 49 – 51 . Nonetheless , the activity of subcortical neuromodulatory systems may not be strictly necessary for consciousness if an appro - priate subset of cortical regions has sufficient intrinsic activation 52 . Indeed , when awakened from NREM sleep , when the activity of most neuromodulatory systems is reduced 53 , participants report having been conscious before being woken in more than one - third of instances 54 . Unilateral or bilateral lesions of the basal ganglia can produce akinetic mutism 55 , an abulic , emotionless state associated with preserved tracking of visual stimuli 56 that is difficult to evaluate with respect to experiential content . In such patients , basal ganglia atrophy corre - lates with the loss of alertness , but not with the degree of responsiveness 57 . It is known that large , bilateral basal ganglia haemorrhagic lesions can occur without signifi - cant alteration in the level of consciousness 58 . For exam - ple , children affected by familial bilateral basal ganglia necrosis may not be able to speak , but are able to respond to sensory stimuli and communicate with their parents in other ways 59 . Similarly , adults with late onset familial dystonia and lesions throughout the basal ganglia may develop cognitive problems , which can include a fron - tal syndrome , but are nonetheless clearly conscious 60 . Thus , despite the many loops that link the cortex , basal ganglia and thalamus , and then go back to the cortex , and the involvement of such loops in cognitive , limbic , motor and oculomotor functions 61 , 62 , it remains unclear whether the basal ganglia contribute to consciousness directly or only indirectly ( either as enabling factors or by implementing unconscious functions ) . The claustrum , a thin sheet of cells underneath the insular cortex and above the putamen that is connected bidirectionally with most cortical regions 63 , was hypoth - esized to play a critical part in information integration leading to consciousness 64 . A single case report of a patient implanted with electrodes for remedial surgery to treat epileptic seizures describes how electrical stim - ulation of the white matter tract underneath the claus - trum caused the patient to stare blankly ahead , seemingly unconscious , until the stimulation had stopped , without subsequent recall and without causing any seizure activ - ity 65 . However , another case report describes a patient who was conscious despite the fact that the claustrum and neighbouring limbic structures , including the insular cortex , had been destroyed bilaterally as a consequence of herpes simplex encephalitis 66 . The role of the thalamus in consciousness remains controversial . Small bilateral lesions in the intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus can lead to coma 67 , 68 , and chronic thalamic electrical stimulation may promote recov - ery in some patients with disorders of consciousness 69 . Although the so - called core neurons in primary thal - amic nuclei have focused connectivity , several higher - order thalamic nuclei are rich in widely projecting matrix cells 70 , which may facilitate interactions among distant cortical areas 71 . Thus , some thalamic cells may represent critical enabling factors for consciousness . Nonetheless , extensive lesions of the thalamus in rodents have found little effect on EEG recordings , behavioural measures or FOS expression in the cortex during wakefulness 72 . In addition , structural imaging of 143 patients with severe brain injury and disorders of consciousness revealed no correlation between the level of arousal and thalamic atrophy , but did find a correlation between decreased motor function and / or the ability to communicate and thalamic atrophy 57 . The activity of thalamic relay nuclei correlates poorly with the level of consciousness in patients who are in a vegetative state 73 . With regard to the role of the thalamus in content - specific NCC , electro physiological recordings from macaque monkeys show that activity in neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus does not correlate with the per - cept reported by the animal 74 , 75 , whereas activity in neu - rons in the pulvinar ( a higher - order thalamic nucleus ) does correlate 75 , 76 . The contribution of the higher - order thalamus to consciousness has been challenged by other findings , however . In humans , unawareness induced by anaesthesia correlates more closely with the impairment in cortical function than with thalamic activity 77 , 78 . When participants experience vivid sleep - onset hallucinations , the thalamus is already deactivated 79 . Cerebral cortex : primary versus higher areas . Whether the primary visual cortex ( V1 ) contributes to visual con - sciousness directly or whether it has only an indirect role — much like the retina’s role in visual consciousness — is the subject of ongoing debate 80 , 81 . Several visual stimuli that are known to affect the activity of V1 neurons do not elicit a corresponding visual experience 82 , 83 . Similarly , it is possible to decode the orientation of a masked stimulus from the haemodynamic activity of the participants’ V1 while the stimulus is presented , although the participants cannot correctly guess the orientation 84 . Single - neuron recordings in monkeys , carried out during paradigms such as binocular rivalry , suggest that activity in most V1 neurons is linked to the identity of the physical stimulus rather than the percept . This contrasts with the activity of neurons higher up in the visual hierarchy , which cor - relates with the percept rather than the stimulus 24 , 85 , 86 . Although several fMRI studies have found that activity in human V1 can be correlated with perception during R E V I E W S 310 | MAY 2016 | VOLUME 17 www . nature . com / nrn (cid:479) (cid:613) (cid:400)(cid:398)(cid:399)(cid:406) (cid:613) (cid:13)(cid:31)(cid:33)(cid:44)(cid:40)(cid:43)(cid:43)(cid:31)(cid:45) (cid:613) (cid:17)(cid:52)(cid:32)(cid:43)(cid:40)(cid:50)(cid:39)(cid:35)(cid:49)(cid:50) (cid:613) (cid:12)(cid:40)(cid:44)(cid:40)(cid:51)(cid:35)(cid:34)(cid:421) (cid:613) (cid:1)(cid:43)(cid:43) (cid:613) (cid:49)(cid:40)(cid:37)(cid:39)(cid:51)(cid:50) (cid:613) (cid:49)(cid:35)(cid:50)(cid:35)(cid:49)(cid:53)(cid:35)(cid:34)(cid:421) (cid:479) (cid:613) (cid:400)(cid:398)(cid:399)(cid:406) (cid:613) (cid:13)(cid:31)(cid:33)(cid:44)(cid:40)(cid:43)(cid:43)(cid:31)(cid:45) (cid:613) (cid:17)(cid:52)(cid:32)(cid:43)(cid:40)(cid:50)(cid:39)(cid:35)(cid:49)(cid:50) (cid:613) (cid:12)(cid:40)(cid:44)(cid:40)(cid:51)(cid:35)(cid:34)(cid:421) (cid:613) (cid:1)(cid:43)(cid:43) (cid:613) (cid:49)(cid:40)(cid:37)(cid:39)(cid:51)(cid:50) (cid:613) (cid:49)(cid:35)(cid:50)(cid:35)(cid:49)(cid:53)(cid:35)(cid:34)(cid:421) Phosphene A visual experience , in particular featuring flashes of light , that occurs in response to direct mechanical , electrical or magnetic stimulation of the visual cortex . binocular rivalry 87 , 88 or working memory tasks 89 , this is not true for motion - induced blindness 90 . Lesions of V1 lead to the striking phenomenon of unconscious vision or blindsight , whereby the affected participants report not seeing an item but still perform above chance on forced - choice tasks 91 . Their subjective blindness could be a result of the insufficient feedforward activation of higher visual areas , or to lack of feedback to V1 , in which case V1 would be necessary for conscious vision . Patients with damaged extrastriate visual areas and intact V1 can have quadrantanopia , however 92 ( that is , blindness for one - quarter of the visual field ) , suggesting that an intact V1 alone is insufficient for conscious vision . Conversely , in patients with blindsight and a damaged V1 , but intact extrastriate areas , phosphene - like percepts can be induced by stimulating the parietal cortex using TMS 93 . Taken together , the evidence discussed here supports the hypothesis that V1 is not part of the content - specific NCC for the attributes that have been tested so far . It is not known whether this conclusion applies to other visual attributes , such as precise spatial topography , lumin osity and detailed contours 94 – 96 . Whether other primary areas , such as the primary somatosensory and auditory cortex , are or are not part of the content - specific NCC remains to be determined ( for examples , see REFS 97 – 99 ) . A case has been made for distinguishing between a ventral cortical stream for perception and a dorsal stream for action 100 . According to this view , activity in the ventral stream is involved in conscious , stable visual object iden - tification and scene formation 101 , 102 , whereas the dorsal stream deals with the unconscious , moment - to - moment visual control of skilled actions 103 . However , the dichot - omy between ventral and dorsal streams in terms of the identity versus the location of visual stimuli has been called into question 104 , suggesting that both dorsal and ventral streams are important for visual experience 105 , 106 . Human neuroimaging studies that contrast brain activity during wakefulness with brain activity during the vegetative state 107 , general anaesthesia 108 or deep sleep 109 , 110 indicate that there is reduced activity in the fronto - parietal cortices during loss of consciousness . The area with the strongest correlation between decreases in brain activity and loss of consciousness is the postero - medial cortex 8 , 111 . These findings suggest that the fronto - parietal cortices are potential candidates for the full NCC . However , other findings contradict this interpretation , including the observation that blood flow is increased in the fronto - parietal areas during generalized seizures when patients are unconscious 112 . Unlike findings from report - based paradigms , no - report paradigms suggest that frontal activation is more important for task prep - aration and execution than for conscious perception per se 36 ( but see REF . 113 ) . A predominant involvement of the posterior cortex in content - specific consciousness is seen when matching expectations and performance during stimulus presenta - tion 114 , when contrasting awareness with task relevance 34 and in many other recent EEG , magnetoencephalo - graphy and electrocorticography experiments 29 , 34 , 115 – 117 . As mentioned earlier , experiments using a no - task , with - in - state paradigm during both NREM and REM sleep also highlight a posterior cortical hot zone 44 . In fact , during REM sleep , when participants are dreaming vividly , activ - ity in the prefrontal cortex is often low compared with the awake state 118 . In addition , multivariate pattern analysis of fMRI data can decode the identity of visual stimuli from activity in the medial and lateral occipital regions , but not from the prefrontal cortex and intraparietal sulcus , despite the fact that these areas show task - related activation . The decoding strength in the extrastriate visual cortex correlates with the precision of visual working memory for the stimuli , whereas decoding of the frontal cortex and intraparietal sulcus activity correlates with the type and difficulty of the task and the attentional context 119 . More than a century of reports describing electrical brain stimulation carried out during neurosurgery sug - gest that it is difficult to directly elicit experiences from the stimulation of frontal sites , whereas it is easier to trigger specific experiences by stimulating the posterior cortex 120 , such as the perception of faces 121 or the feel - ing of wanting to move a limb 122 . Most importantly , the commonly held view that the content of consciousness is linked to fronto - parietal activation ignores the ample evidence obtained from lesion studies that consciousness does not require an intact prefrontal cortex . For example , complete bilateral frontal lobectomy 123 and large bilat - eral prefrontal resections do not impair consciousness 124 . Likewise , prefrontal lobotomy and leucotomy , in which the prefrontal cortex is cut off from its thalamic inputs , do not impair consciousness 125 . In addition , participants who underwent widespread bilateral resection of their prefrontal areas ( termed topectomy , a procedure that is sometimes combined with lobotomy ) do not show gross behavioural changes and certainly maintain conscious - ness 126 . More recently , a young woman with extensive bilateral prefrontal damage of unclear aetiology was found to have grossly deficient scores in tests of frontal lobe function , but intact perceptual abilities , and was obviously conscious 127 ( see also REF . 128 ) . Taken together , the data suggest that the frontal portions of the broad fronto - parietal network once commonly thought to be necessary for consciousness may play a more prominent part in the control and execution of cognitive tasks than in supporting experience per se ( FIG . 2 ) . Cortical neural responses to visual stimuli , such as natural scenes and faces , can occur quickly ( within 120 – 140 ms ) and presumably are mediated by a feed forward volley through the V1 into the extrastriate cortex and inferior temporal cortex 129 – 131 . It has been suggested that a stimulus - evoked feedforward sweep only gives rise to a conscious percept when it is joined by a re - entrant sweep from the higher - level cortex coming back to the visual cortex 132 , 133 . In monkeys trained to signal whether or not they saw a salient figure embedded in a background image , the early feedforward response of V1 neurons was the same 134 . By contrast , a later feedback compo - nent was suppressed only when the monkey did not see the figure , and this later component ( but not the early one ) was eliminated by light anaesthesia . Directional connectivity studies in humans 135 and in mice 136 suggest that top - down connectivity is stronger when somato sensory stimuli are perceived than when they are not .

Cell - type specificity . An outstanding question is whether distinct cortical cell types — such as the spindle neu - rons ( also known as von Economo neurons ) found in layer 5 of the frontal lobe in species with large , convo - luted brains 143 — are associated with specific aspects of consciousness . Auto - radiographic studies in cats have shown that the infragranular layers of the visual cortex have reduced activity during slow wave sleep 144 . Large , thick - tufted pyramidal neurons found in a variety of spe - cies in layer 5B seem well equipped to integrate local and long - distance inputs 145 through their distal apical tufts that receive large amounts of feedback from higher - level cortical regions . However , these thick - tufted cells project primarily to subcortical structures , and their limited con - nectivity within the cortex suggests that they may be better suited to implement cortico – subcortico – cortical loops that mediate unconscious functions and behaviours 146 . By contrast , thin - tufted pyramidal cells that exclusively form cortico – cortical connections in layer 5A are more heavily interconnected , as are some cells in layer 6 ( REF . 146 ) . Supragranular pyramidal cells are even more densely connected than layer 5A neurons 146 – 148 . Both the feed - forward projections from , and feedback projections to , these neurons originate in the superficial layers of the cortex and exhibit greater topographic precision than those originating in infragranular layers 149 . The apical dendrites of the supragranular pyramidal cells — as well as the different types of inhibitory interneurons located in superficial layers 150 — are also a target of feedback connections and of diffusely projecting thalamic matrix cells 146 . In addition , although infra - and supragranular layers are interconnected , they can become uncoupled by attentional processes 151 , 152 and sleep 153 . Functionally , excitatory neurons in the supragranular cortex are more specific in their discharge properties than infragranular neurons 154 . Neuronal avalanches — spatiotemporal pat - terns of spontaneous activity that reflect a critical state of network excitability favourable to information inte - gration — only occur in supragranular layers 155 . Across many species , neural activity in the supragranular layers often correlates with conscious sensation . For exam - ple , a negative slow potential that is likely to originate from supragranular layers 156 occurs between the onset of a stimulus and the behavioural response only when a near - threshold stimulus is perceived 157 , 158 . Under propofol anaesthesia , this late negative shift in slow cortical poten - tials disappears , whereas the early positive component is preserved 159 . As another example , in the somatosensory cortex of awake monkeys there is a correlation between conscious detection and the magnitude and latency of the N1 event - related potential ( ERP ) generated by excitatory input onto supragranular layers ( which is most likely to be feedback connections originating in higher cortical areas ) 99 . Notably , the N1 is abolished during general anaesthesia 160 and slow wave sleep 161 . Figure 2 | Identifying content - specific and full neural correlates of consciousness . a | Findings from a functional MRI ( fMRI ) experiment searching for content - specific neural correlates of consciousness ( NCC ) . This experiment contrasts activity during the presentation of visual words with activity when the same words are masked and therefore invisible . This task involves an explicit report via button - press . Such studies have suggested that activity in the fronto - parietal networks and extrastriate occipital regions 142 constitute the NCC . b | Similar fronto - parietal activity patterns are found during a binocular rivalry paradigm in which volunteers actively report their percept ( task ) . However , when the volunteers experience rivalry without explicitly reporting perceptual alternations ( no task ) , neural activity in the frontal areas is absent , whereas activation of the occipital and parietal regions remains 36 . c | Findings from an electrocorticogram ( ECoG ) study using a visual one - back paradigm in patients with epilepsy implanted with subdural electrode arrays .

When the systematic search for the NCC began , the discovery of synchronized neuronal discharges in the visual cortex in response to two jointly moving visual stimuli in the low gamma range ( 30 – 70 Hz ) in anaesthetized and awake cats generated much excitement 162 . This led to the proposal that conscious - ness requires the synchronization of populations of neurons via rhythmic discharges in the gamma range 21 , which might account for the binding of multiple stim - ulus features within a single experience 163 ( FIG . 3a – c ) . Stimulus - speci fi c gamma range synchronization in the visual cortex of cats is facilitated by attention 164 and by the stimulation of the reticular formation 165 , 166 . Gamma synchrony reflects perceptual dominance during bin - ocular rivalry , although fi ring rates may not change 167 . Human EEG and magnetoencephalography studies also suggest that long - distance gamma synchrony may correlate with visual consciousness 168 , 169 . However , many of these studies did not carefully dissociate conscious visibility from selective attention ( see Supplementary information S1 ( box ) ) . When this is done , high - range gamma synchronization corre - lates with attention , independent of whether the stim - ulus was seen by the participant , whereas mid - range gamma synchronization correlates with the visibility of the stimulus 170 ( see also REF . 33 ) . Gamma synchrony can persist or even increase during early NREM sleep , during anaesthesia 171 , 172 or during seizures 173 , and can be present during exposure to stimuli that induce uncon - scious emotional responses 174 , suggesting that gamma synchrony can occur in the absence of consciousness . An electrocorticography study of the human visual cortex showed that narrowband gamma oscillations are reliably elicited by some spatial patterns , such as luminance grat - ings , but not by others , such as noise patterns and natural images that observers readily see and recognize 175 . This has led to the conclusion that gamma band oscillations are not necessary for seeing 176 . P3b . Another well - studied electrophysiological candidate marker of consciousness is a late ( > 300 ms after the onset of stimulus ) , positive , fronto - parietal ERP evoked by visual or auditory stimuli , called the P3b , which was first described 50 years ago 177 . Studies using content - specific , task - based paradigms using masking , attentional blink and manipulations of stimulus strength show that the P3b component of the ERP is a robust correlate of the subjec - tive report of stimulus detection 17 , 141 , 178 ( FIG . 3d – f ) . Thus the P3b , measured using an auditory oddball paradigm , has been proposed as a signature of consciousness , revealing a non - linear amplification ( also referred to as ignition ) of cortical activity through a distributed network involving fronto - parietal areas 142 . However , this interpretation has been contradicted by several experimental results . For example , task - irrelevant stimuli do not trigger a P3b 179 even when participants are clearly conscious of them 34 , whereas stimuli that are not consciously detected can trigger a P3b 180 . The P3b does not signal conscious perception when participants already have a target stimulus held in working memory 114 . Findings from between - state paradigms have also cast doubt on the use of P3b ignition as a reliable signature of consciousness because the P3b elicited by global viola - tions of auditory regularities ( for example , sequences of same – different tones ) does not discriminate between vegetative ( presumably unconscious ) and minimally con - scious patients 181 . In fact , the P3b is absent in the major - ity of patients with brain damage who remain clearly conscious 182 – 184 and has minimal sensitivity ( 0 . 14 ) in identifying minimally conscious patients 185 . Multivariate decoding of the P3b signal can improve the sensitivity of global viola tions in response to auditory regularities 186 . When this kind of analysis is applied , however , it is possi - ble to find a P3b - like component in 40 % of coma patients who are unresponsive , sedated and hypothermic 187 . Hence , the P3b is not a marker of consciousness . The visual awareness negativity , an ERP deflection that starts as early as 100 ms after the onset of a stimulus , peaks around 200 – 250 ms and is localized to the pos - terior cortex ( occipital , temporal and post erior parietal lobes ) 34 , 188 , may correlate better with conscious percep - tion . Even earlier parietal and temporal evoked responses ( at around 70 ms after the onset of a stimulus ) correlate with the perception of phosphenes elicited by parietal and occipital TMS , respectively 106 . Activated EEG . The low - voltage fast activity observed with EEG recordings performed during attentive wake - fulness , also known as activated or desynchronized EEG 49 , was one of the first candidate electrophysiological indices of consciousness and is still one of the most sensi - tive and useful markers available . Over the past 30 years , intracellular recordings from cortical and thalamic neu - rons in cats have revealed the mechanisms that underlie the transition from the low - voltage fast activity that char - acterizes wakefulness to the high - voltage , slow activity that characterizes deep slow wave sleep and some forms of anaesthesia 189 . When thalamic neurons are hyper - polarized , they switch from a tonic to a bursting firing mode , resulting in the synchronization of the EEG in the spindle ( 12 – 14 Hz ) and theta ( 5 – 8 Hz ) ranges 189 . Larger oscillations in the delta range ( < 4 Hz ; also known as slow waves ) appear in the EEG when cortical neurons start alternating synchronously between depolarized up - states and hyperpolarized down - states every second or so 190 ( FIG . 3g ) . This sequence of physiological events accom - panies a loss of consciousness in physiological , pharma - cological and pathological conditions 40 . In general , slow waves can be initiated by a decrease in the firing rate of subcortical activating systems 49 , 191 , by excessive inhibition exerted by the globus pallidus on the thalamus 192 or by a critical level of cortical deafferentation 193 common in comatose patients 194 . Detecting repeated high - amplitude slow waves ( > 75 μ V ) in the EEG is an effective way to assess the loss of consciousness in humans and is better than most available alternatives 172 , 195 . For example , slow waves are prominent during deep sleep early in the night when participants , if awakened , often claim they had not experienced anything at all 54 . Similarly , a sudden increase in slow wave power coincides with the behavioural loss of consciousness on R E V I E W S NATURE REVIEWS | NEUROSCIENCE VOLUME 17 | MAY 2016 | 313 (cid:479) (cid:613) (cid:400)(cid:398)(cid:399)(cid:406) (cid:613) (cid:13)(cid:31)(cid:33)(cid:44)(cid:40)(cid:43)(cid:43)(cid:31)(cid:45) (cid:613) (cid:17)(cid:52)(cid:32)(cid:43)(cid:40)(cid:50)(cid:39)(cid:35)(cid:49)(cid:50) (cid:613) (cid:12)(cid:40)(cid:44)(cid:40)(cid:51)(cid:35)(cid:34)(cid:421) (cid:613) (cid:1)(cid:43)(cid:43) (cid:613) (cid:49)(cid:40)(cid:37)(cid:39)(cid:51)(cid:50) (cid:613) (cid:49)(cid:35)(cid:50)(cid:35)(cid:49)(cid:53)(cid:35)(cid:34)(cid:421) (cid:479) (cid:613) (cid:400)(cid:398)(cid:399)(cid:406) (cid:613) (cid:13)(cid:31)(cid:33)(cid:44)(cid:40)(cid:43)(cid:43)(cid:31)(cid:45) (cid:613) (cid:17)(cid:52)(cid:32)(cid:43)(cid:40)(cid:50)(cid:39)(cid:35)(cid:49)(cid:50) (cid:613) (cid:12)(cid:40)(cid:44)(cid:40)(cid:51)(cid:35)(cid:34)(cid:421) (cid:613) (cid:1)(cid:43)(cid:43) (cid:613) (cid:49)(cid:40)(cid:37)(cid:39)(cid:51)(cid:50) (cid:613) (cid:49)(cid:35)(cid:50)(cid:35)(cid:49)(cid:53)(cid:35)(cid:34)(cid:421) 0 50 100 150 200 0 0 . 5 a b d e c Content - speciﬁc approaches (cid:10)(cid:73)a(cid:79)(cid:79)a s(cid:91)nchron(cid:91)(cid:11) Content - speciﬁc approaches (cid:10)(cid:50)(cid:21)b(cid:11) State - based approaches f g h N u m b e r o f s p i k e s – 50 + 50 0 Time ( ms ) Time ( s ) Time ( s ) Time ( s ) Stimulus orientation 0° Stimulus orientation 180° 22 0 0 0 . 6 0 . 6 1 . 0 2 . 0 3 . 0 4 . 0 5 . 0 G a mm a p o w e r c h a n g e 0 . 2 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 4 More sensory evidenceLess sensory evidence Without previous exposureWith previous exposure 0 0 . 5 F r e q u e n c y ( H z ) N o r m a l i z e d l o g p o w e r 1 . 3 – 1 . 3 Seen – absent Unseen – absent – 2 2 0 (cid:350) V 0 0 . 4 0 . 8 P3b Time ( s ) – 2 2 (cid:350) V 0 . 6 Task relevant Task irrelevant Sleep P3b MRF stimulation EEG cortex Intracellularcortex 20 m V 2 s 1 s Fp2 - F4 F4 - C4 C4 - P4 P4 - O2 Fp1 - F3 Time ( s ) 10 8 6 4 2 0 – 2 – 4 P3b 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 A m p l i t u d e ( (cid:350) V ) Frequent stimulus Rare stimulus Figure 3 | Candidate neurophysiological markers of consciousness . a | Gamma synchrony has been proposed as a correlate of consciousness .

In a clinical context , the changing pattern of waves from delta , through theta , to alpha range frequency dominance corresponds to the progression from the vegetative state or coma , to the minimally conscious state , to behavioural consciousness 197 . Nevertheless , distinguishing conscious from uncon - scious participants on the basis of global EEG pat - terns is not always reliable . For example , a widespread alpha rhythm has been recorded in patients in a severe post - anoxic coma 198 . Conversely , EEG can show persistent large slow waves in conscious participants during some rare instances of status epilepticus 199 , 200 ( FIG . 3h ) . In such patients , slow wave activity may only involve some cortical areas . Intracranial electrical recordings show that , during sleep , some cortical areas may become activated while the scalp EEG is still dominated by slow waves 201 . Source mod - elling reveals that such locally activated EEG over a parieto - occipital region just before awakening from slow wave sleep occurs when participants report visual dreams , even though other cortical areas display low - frequency activity at this time 44 . Thus , it may be that local , rather than global , EEG activation is important for consciousness , especially over the posterior cortical hot zone . Neural differentiation and integration EEG remains a fundamental clinical tool for discriminat - ing between conscious and unconscious patients 202 . Such an evaluation typically includes qualitative features of the spontaneous EEG ( such as activation ) and how EEG activity responds to perturbations ( such as when patients open their eyes ) that capture the degree of spatiotemporal differentiation of electrical activity in the brain 203 . This classic notion of the activated EEG , often overlooked in the search for the NCC , suggests that a large repertoire of neural activity patterns is important for conscious - ness 1 ; recent studies support this view . For example , in rats , the number of unique fMRI blood - oxygen - level - dependent ( BOLD ) patterns increases with the recovery of consciousness from desflurane anaesthesia 204 . The rep - ertoire of fMRI functional connectivity configurations is greater during wakefulness than during propofol anaes - thesia in monkeys 205 . Likewise , electrocortical dynamics become more stable on loss of consciousness , regardless of anaesthetic - specific effects on activity 206 . In humans , measuring the entropy of brain activity is used to assess the depth of anaesthesia 207 and provides a useful prog - nostic index of recovery of consciousness in patients in a vegetative state 208 , 209 . It is generally recognized that consciousness also requires an integrated neural substrate 1 . In support of this notion , fMRI studies of whole - brain functional con - nectivity show that integration decreases and modularity increases when consciousness is lost during sleep 77 , 210 , anaesthesia 212 and coma 211 . On a finer timescale , similar conclusions have been obtained by measuring functional connectivity using EEG , especially in the alpha and theta ranges 213 – 215 . However , indices of cortical integration ( such as EEG coherence and Granger causality ) can be increased in conditions in which consciousness is lost , such as during propofol anaesthesia 216 or generalized seizures 217 , whereas EEG measures of differentiation ( such as the bispectral index and spectral entropy ) are only useful at the group level as a result of wide variations across participants 181 , 218 . The perturbational complexity index ( PCI ) , obtained using a combination of TMS and EEG recordings 219 , assesses the level of consciousness based on the notion that being conscious requires both the differentiation and integration of cortical activity 1 , 38 . Unlike measures of the differentiation of spontaneous activity , PCI eval - uates the deterministic responses of the cortex to per - turbations and is therefore largely insensitive to random processes or to locally generated patterns that are not genuinely integrated . Unlike measures of integration that rely on widespread neural synchronization , the PCI is low when neural activations are spatially extended but undif - ferentiated , as is often the case during anaesthesia and generalized seizures . TMS can also be used to assess con - sciousness when participants are disconnected from sen - sory inputs and motor outputs , such as during REM sleep and ketamine anaesthesia 220 , because it bypasses sensory pathways . PCI is the first metric that successfully assesses the level of consciousness under different conditions ( for example , during different sleep stages , during exposure to anaesthetics and in disorders of consciousness ) and at the level of single participants ( FIG . 4 ) . Conclusions Much progress has occurred since the initiation of the modern quest for the NCC in 1990 ( REF . 21 ) . Conceptual work by both philosophers and scientists 221 has clarified the importance of investigating the neural correlates of both specific conscious contents and of consciousness as a whole 43 . The aim is to avoid confounds resulting from task performance and changes in behavioural state , so that the NCC proper can be isolated from the neural events leading up to and following on from becoming con - scious 30 – 32 , 222 ( FIG . 1 ) . Based on the definition of the NCC , it is also critical to consider not only correlative evidence from neuroimaging studies and unit recordings , but also causal evidence from brain stimulation and lesion studies . The anatomical basis of the full NCC and content - specific NCC do not comprise the wide fronto - parietal network emphasized in past studies , but are primarily localized to a more restricted temporo - parietal - occipital hot zone with additional contributions from some ante - rior regions ( FIG . 2 ) . At least some cortical areas in this posterior privileged zone , especially high - level sensory areas , are close to qualifying as content - specific NCC . For example , in humans , the activation of face areas correlates closely and systematically with seeing faces , whereas stim - ulation of the same region ( on the right side ) can induce or alter the perception of faces 121 and , crucially , lesions in the face areas render participants unable to recognize familiar faces ( face - blindness ) . Experiencing specific contents associated with activity in the posterior hot zone does not require the amplifi - cation of fronto - parietal network activity 142 . Instead , the frontal cortex is involved in allocating attention and in task execution , monitoring and reporting . This illustrates the danger of relying too heavily on correlative evidence from neuroimaging studies to identify the NCC : as a result R E V I E W S NATURE REVIEWS | NEUROSCIENCE VOLUME 17 | MAY 2016 | 315 (cid:479) (cid:613) (cid:400)(cid:398)(cid:399)(cid:406) (cid:613) (cid:13)(cid:31)(cid:33)(cid:44)(cid:40)(cid:43)(cid:43)(cid:31)(cid:45) (cid:613) (cid:17)(cid:52)(cid:32)(cid:43)(cid:40)(cid:50)(cid:39)(cid:35)(cid:49)(cid:50) (cid:613) (cid:12)(cid:40)(cid:44)(cid:40)(cid:51)(cid:35)(cid:34)(cid:421) (cid:613) (cid:1)(cid:43)(cid:43) (cid:613) (cid:49)(cid:40)(cid:37)(cid:39)(cid:51)(cid:50) (cid:613) (cid:49)(cid:35)(cid:50)(cid:35)(cid:49)(cid:53)(cid:35)(cid:34)(cid:421) (cid:479) (cid:613) (cid:400)(cid:398)(cid:399)(cid:406) (cid:613) (cid:13)(cid:31)(cid:33)(cid:44)(cid:40)(cid:43)(cid:43)(cid:31)(cid:45) (cid:613) (cid:17)(cid:52)(cid:32)(cid:43)(cid:40)(cid:50)(cid:39)(cid:35)(cid:49)(cid:50) (cid:613) (cid:12)(cid:40)(cid:44)(cid:40)(cid:51)(cid:35)(cid:34)(cid:421) (cid:613) (cid:1)(cid:43)(cid:43) (cid:613) (cid:49)(cid:40)(cid:37)(cid:39)(cid:51)(cid:50) (cid:613) (cid:49)(cid:35)(cid:50)(cid:35)(cid:49)(cid:53)(cid:35)(cid:34)(cid:421) High integration High di(cid:557)erentiation Low di(cid:557)erentiation Low integration a Integration b (cid:38)i(cid:557)erentiation c (cid:43)nte(cid:73)ration and di(cid:557)erentiation Compression 0 . 0 0 . 8 P C I W a k e f u l n e ss N R E M M i d a z o l a m X e n o n P r o p o f o l R E M K e t a m i n e V S / U W S M C S E M C S L I S Immediate report Retrospective report No report ResponsiveUnresponsive TMS High integration and di(cid:557)erentiation Low integration Low di(cid:557)erentiation of the intricate connectivity of the brain , activity in the prefrontal cortex , basal ganglia and even cerebellum can co - vary systematically with conscious perception without being responsible for it . It is possible that some prefrontal regions mediate content - specific NCC for particular types of experiences , such as feelings of reflection and introspection , valuation and affect , whereas other prefrontal regions contribute nothing directly to conscious experience , not unlike the basal ganglia and cerebellum . It remains unclear whether neurons within primary sensory areas contribute spe - cific contents to consciousness — for example , whether neurons in V1 are responsible for perceived location in visual space . The brainstem reticular formation , paramedian thal - amus and perhaps parts of the postero - medial cortex are likely to provide the background conditions for full con - sciousness . By serving as activating influences and cor - tical hubs , they enable effective interactions among the cortical areas that directly contribute conscious content . Figure 4 | Neural differentiation and integration as neural correlates of consciousness . a | Schematic diagram showing two idealized time series of spontaneous brain activity ( electroencephalography ( EEG ) ) and the corresponding maps of cortical connectivity . Integration , as measured by indices of functional connectivity , tends to be high when time series are highly correlated ( top panel ) and low when time series are not highly correlated ( bottom panel ) . b | The same two time series are shown together with the corresponding maps of spatiotemporal variability in brain activity . Differentiation , here reflected in the difference between subsequent maps of cortical activity , tends to be high ( top panel ) when the time series are not highly correlated ( maximum for random time series ) and low when they are highly correlated ( bottom panel ) . c | The perturbational complexity index ( PCI ) simultaneously quantifies integration and differentiation . Calculating the PCI involves perturbing the brain with transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) , recording the results of EEG to detect the pattern of causal cortical interactions engaged by the TMS perturbation ( integration ) and compressing this pattern to calculate its spatiotemporal variability with algorithmic complexity measures ( differentiation ) . Responses that are both integrated and differentiated are less compressible , resulting in high PCI values . By contrast , local ( low integration ) or stereotypical ( low differentiation ) EEG responses to TMS can be effectively compressed , yielding low PCI values . As shown in the right - hand panel ( real data ) , jointly measuring integration and differentiation with PCI establishes a common measurement scale that is valid across many different conditions along the unconsciousness – consciousness spectrum and is reliable at the level of single paticipants 219 , 220 , including : those who are awake and able to report immediately that they are conscious ( red circles ) ; participants in rapid eye movement ( REM ) sleep and under ketamine anaesthesia who are unresponsive , but able to report retrospectively that they were conscious ( green circles ) ; participants in non - REM ( NREM ) sleep or general anaesthesia ( midazolam , propofol and xenon ) who provide no conscious report on awakening ( dark blue circles ) ; vegetative state / unresponsive wakefulness syndrome ( VS / UWS ) patients ( light blue circles ) ; and responsive brain - injured patients who are in a minimally conscious state ( MCS ) , emerged from the MCS ( EMCS ) or in a locked - in syndrome ( LIS ) ( light red circles ) .

Regarding the neurophysiological markers of con - sciousness , hopes that gamma activity or synchrony , or the ERP P3b , could be signatures of consciousness have proved illusory ( FIG . 3 ) . An activated EEG , one of the oldest electrophysiological indices of consciousness , is a better marker of consciousness than these measures , as long as it is taken into account that it is the local rather than global EEG activation that is important , especially within the posterior cortical hot zone . Novel indices of consciousness assess the differen - tiation of neural activity ( the availability of a large rep - ertoire of different firing patterns ) and its integration ( whether a neural system behaves as a single entity ) . The most promising of these is the simultaneous causal assessment of differentiation and integration — for exam - ple , the complexity of EEG responses following a TMS pulse 219 , 220 ( FIG . 4 ) . The sheer number of causal interactions in the brain 1 , together with the fleeting nature of many experiences 223 , pose challenges to even sophisticated experimental approaches to the NCC . The NCC by themselves can provide little information about consciousness in patients with severe brain damage , infants , fetuses , non - human species or intelligent machines ( BOX 1 ) . Further pro - gress in this field will require , in addition to empirical work , testable theories that address in a principled man - ner what consciousness is and what is required of its physical substrate 224 . Box 1 | Hard cases and hard calls It is possible to search for either full or content - specific neural correlates of consciousness ( derived from experiments in healthy control subjects ) in some patients who are behaviourally unresponsive as a result of brain lesions . For example , one patient in a vegetative state , when told to imagine playing tennis or to mentally navigate around her house , displayed increased haemodynamic activity in specific cortical regions in a manner similar to healthy control subjects 11 . However , many patients who are behaviourally conscious fail this test 225 . Furthermore , it is not clear what should be concluded in patients whose brain is severely damaged and inactive , except for one or a few isolated cortical areas that show signs of metabolic and electrophysiological activation 226 . Can these isolated islands of functioning tissue support a limited kind of consciousness ? What does it feel like to have such an island of brain activity , if , indeed , the patient in question feels anything at all ? Similar problems arise when studying parasomnias . Sleepwalkers often display complex behaviours , but it is difficult to wake them and they often do not recall any dreams 227 . Neuroimaging during sleepwalking episodes reveals mixed signs of local sleep and wake states 228 , 229 . It is also difficult to assess consciousness during epileptic seizures ( for example , partial seizures with automatisms and many instances of generalized seizures , such as absences ) that are not always associated with a complete loss of consciousness 230 . Likewise , patients who are anaesthetized with dissociative anaesthetics such as ketamine , which have complex effects on the brain , are fully unresponsive , but , on awakening , report long , vivid dreams from the period of anaesthesia 220 . The assessment of consciousness in patients who remain immobile — for example , owing to extreme Parkinson - like states 231 or catatonia 232 — is even more problematic . Similarly the extent of conscious experience in newborn infants , who have immature brains and restricted connectivity among cortical structures , is unclear 233 . A wave resembling the P300 has been reported in 6 – 16 - month - old infants , although it is weaker , more variable and later than in adults 234 . However , as mentioned in the main text , a P3b - like wave can be present in patients who are comatose and hypothermic 187 , but is not present in some conscious adults 181 . Thus resorting to the P3b wave to infer the presence of consciousness in infants , and its absence in newborn and pre - term infants , is problematic . Assessing consciousness is even more problematic in non - human animals . It is likely that mammals that share many behavioural traits with humans , and have brains organized in a similar manner to human brains , are conscious . Indeed , in laboratory settings used to study the neural correlates of consciousness in humans , macaque monkeys act very similarly to humans , including signalling when they do not see a stimulus under blindsight conditions 18 . However , in species that are more distant from humans in evolutionary and neural terms , the question of whether they are conscious becomes more difficult . Birds , fish , cephalopods and insects are capable of sophisticated , learned , non - stereotyped behaviours that are typically associated with consciousness in humans 235 – 237 . Although their nervous systems may be smaller and organized differently , they are still very complex . For example , bee brains contain close to 1 million nerve cells packed up to ten times more densely than in the neocortex and assembled in non - linear feedback circuits 238 . Yet humans can perform complex behaviours in a seemingly non - conscious manner , such as detecting the meaning of words , doing simple arithmetic or typing rapidly 239 – 244 , and highly complex structures in the human brain , such as the cerebellum , do not contribute to consciousness 47 – 48 . Thus , when a bee chooses a branch point marked by red in a maze 245 , we do not know if it does so consciously 246 , as humans might do under such circumstances , or by following an unconscious programme . 1 .
