We sought to characterize mechanisms underpinning CD44 - promoted adhesion of BLBC cells to vascular endothelial monolayers and extracellular matrix ( ECM ) substrates . Stimulation with hyaluronan ( HA ) , the native ligand for CD44 , increased expression and activation of β1 - integrin receptors , and increased α5 - integrin subunit expression . Adhesion assays confirmed that CD44 - signalling potentiated BLBC cell adhesion to endothelium and Fibronectin in an α5B1 - integrin - dependent mechanism . Co - immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed HA - promoted association of CD44 with talin and the β1 - integrin chain in BLBC cells . Knockdown of talin inhibited CD44 complexing with β1 - integrin and repressed HA - induced , CD44 - mediated activation of β1 - integrin receptors . Immunoblotting confirmed that HA induced rapid phosphorylation of cortactin and paxillin , through a CD44 - dependent and β1 - integrin - dependent mechanism . Knockdown of CD44 , cortactin or paxillin independently attenuated the adhesion of BL - BCa cells to endothelial monolayers and Fibronectin . Accordingly , we conclude that CD44 induced , integrin - mediated signaling not only underpins efficient adhesion of BLBC cells to BMECs to facilitate extravasation but initiates their adhesion to Fibronectin , enabling penetrant cancer cells to adhere more efficiently to underlying Fibronectin - enriched matrix present within the metastatic niche . INTRODUCTION Extravasation , a critical step within the metastatic cascade concerns the arrest and adherence of circulating tumor cells ( CTCs ) on the vascular endothelium within distant tissues and organs . This process requires an initial arrest on the endothelial cells after which the adherent tumor cells traverse the endothelial barrier to gain access to the stroma of the underlying tissue . Tumor cells are proposed to replicate lymphocyte behavior and roll along the endothelial surface prior to attaching firmly to the endothelial monolayer [ 1 ] . As in lymphocyte adhesion , cancer cell extravasation is considered to be dependent upon multiple receptor dependent interactions between the tumor cell and the endothelium to regulate “rolling” and “arrest” on the endothelium , prior to exit of the cell from the circulation [ 2 ] . Moreover , in order for the invading cancer cell to form a clinically - relevant tumor within the new tissue , the cancer cell must embed and adhere to the substrates present within this new niche . CD44 is a cell - surface glycoprotein receptor for hyaluronan ( HA ) and is an accepted marker for isolating tumourigenic , stem - like breast cancer cells [ 3 , 4 ] . CD44 expression is selectively over - expressed in estrogen receptor ( ER ) - and progesterone receptor ( PR ) - negative breast tumors , with enrichment detected in basal - like breast cancer ( BLBC ) [ 5 – 7 ] . Furthermore , CD44 - positive , stem - like breast cancer cells have been detected within the bone marrow of early - stage breast cancer patients [ 8 , 9 ] . Our prior observations demonstrate the importance of Oncotarget 36763 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget CD44 in potentiating the adhesion of representative cell - based models of BLBC to human bone marrow endothelial cells ( BMECs ) in vitro , indicating a role in supporting more efficient extravasation of the cells [ 10 , 11 ] . Moreover , we have shown that CD44 expression increases the efficiency of distant metastasis of BLBC cells in vivo [ 7 ] . Knockdown of CD44 reduced the incidence and size of distant metastases resulting from the intracardiac injection of BLBC cells , including reduced metastasis in the bone , lungs , liver and brain . CD44 initiated adhesion has been shown to induce an integrin receptor - mediated adhesion of T - lymphocytes [ 12 , 13 ] , mediated in part through the complexing of CD44 with the α4β1 - integrin receptor expressed on the surface of these cells , and secondly , through a downstream promotion of cytoskeletal reorganization [ 14 ] . In addition , Fujisaki and colleagues determined that CD44 signaling could initiate LFA - 1 integrin activation to facilitate adhesion to endothelium and promote transactivation of colorectal cancer cells [ 15 ] . The objective of this study was to characterize the potential mechanism by which CD44 potentiates the adhesion of BLBC cells to endothelium and matrix substrates . Here we characterize the biochemical and functional importance of a CD44 - induced regulation of β1 - integrin receptor expression and activation in BLBC cells , resulting in the activation of a cortactin - paxillin signal transduction pathway which underpins cancer cell adhesion to endothelial cells and extracellular matrix ( ECM ) . RESULTS CD44 signaling regulates specific α and β1 - integrin expression α4β1 - integrin receptors play an important role in the extravasation of CD44 - positive T - lymphocytes in vivo [ 13 ] . We conducted experiments to characterize the relationship between CD44 and integrin subunit expression and / or activation , using two representative CD44 - expressing models of BLBC , the MDA - MB - 231 and Hs578T cell lines [ 6 ] , and the metastatic prostate cancer cell line , PC3 [ 10 ] . Stimulation with low molecular weight HA ( LMW - HA , the signaling ligand for CD44 ) promoted a rapid increase in β1 - integrin subunit expression , together with an increased pool of activated β1 - integrin receptors as detected by the B44 and HUTS - 4 antibodies ( that only recognize the active conformation of the β1 - integrin ) [ 16 ] ( Figure 1A ) . Furthermore , immunofluorescence - microscopy confirmed the increased activated β1 - integrin receptor pool post - HA stimulation in the MDA - MB - 231 cells ( Figure 1B ) . Although the α4 - integrin subunit is proposed to mediate CD44 - promoted adhesion of T - lymphocytes , we failed to detect expression of the α4 - integrin subunit in BLBC cells by immunocytochemistry , immunoblotting or flow cytometry ( data not shown ) . Instead , immunoblotting confirmed that HA stimulation of BLBC cells promoted a rapid increase in the expression of the α5 - integrin subunit , concurrent with increased expression of the β1 - integrin receptor chain ( Figure 1A ) . A similar profile of increased expression and activation of the α5 and β1 - integrin receptors was also detected in CD44 - positive PC3 cells , a bone - metastatic prostate cancer line , in response to HA ( Supplementary Figure S1A ) . Integrin receptors contribute to CD44 promoted cell - cell and cell - matrix adhesion The importance of β1 - integrin receptors in underpinning CD44 - promoted adhesion to BMEC monolayers was studied using pan - or selective function - blocking integrin antibodies . Blockade of all potential β1 - integrin heterodimers and specific inhibition of the α5β1 - integrin receptor attenuated MDA - MB - 231 cell adhesion to BMECs by 73 % ( p < 0 . 05 ) and 61 % ( p < 0 . 01 ) , respectively . In contrast , α2β1 - integrin blockade had no effect on MDA - MB - 231 cell adhesion to BMECs ( Figure 1C ) . A similar importance of the α5β1 - integrin receptor was observed in PC3 cells ( Supplementary Figure S1B ) . CD44 signaling promotes adhesion to fibronectin The native ECM ligand of the α5β1 - integrin heterodimer is Fibronectin . Therefore , we determined whether CD44 - induced activation of this integrin may also underpin increased adhesion of MDA - MB - 231 cells to this ECM substrate . Initial experiments demonstrated that pre - treatment with the β1 - integrin function - blocking antibody reduced MDA - MB - 231 adhesion to Fibronectin by 84 % ( p < 0 . 05 ) , confirming the importance of β1 - integrin receptors in mediating adhesion of CD44 - positive MDA - MB - 231 cells to Fibronectin ( Figure 1D ) . The importance of CD44 signaling in promoting adhesion to Fibronectin was demonstrated in two further assays . Firstly , the addition of HA markedly increased the maximal adhesion of CD44 - positive MDA - MB - 231 cells to Fibronectin ( p < 0 . 05 ) ( Figure 1E ) . Furthermore , using stable CD44 - depleted clones of MDA - MB - 231 cells , we confirmed that loss of CD44 correlated with a significant decrease in adhesion potential to Fibronectin , reducing adhesion to approximately 20 % of control values ( p < 0 . 05 ) ( Figure 1F ) . Bone - tropic breast cancer cells have increased pools of activated integrin receptors and demonstrate increased adhesion properties CD44 enhances the efficiency of distant metastasis in vivo , enabling the formation of tumors in multiple secondary sites including the lungs and skeleton . We have also observed that bone - tropic MDA - MB - 231 ( MDA - MB - 231BO ) cells expressed elevated levels of CD44 and adhered more rapidly to a BMEC monolayer in vitro [ 7 ] .

Expression of CD44 levels in shNT ( non - targeting control ) and CD44 - targeted ( sh # 1 and ch # 2 ) cells following stable depletion are presented in McFarlane et al . 2015 . All data shown in adhesion experiments are a mean ± SEM of at least 3 independent experiments . Statistically significant differences in adhesion were determined by a Student’s t - test ; * p < 0 . 05 . Immunoblots are representative of three or more independent experiments . Oncotarget 36765 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget Immunoblotting also reveals these CD44 - enriched MDA - MB - 231BO cells to express increased levels of the α5 and β1 - integrin subunit relative to parental cells , and a greater pool of activated β1 - integrin receptors ( assessed using HUTS - 4 and B44 antibodies ) ( Figure 2A ) . This was further confirmed by quantitative flow cytometry which detected an increased fluorescence intensity to the HUTS - 4 and B44 antibodies in bone tropic cells ( average of 33 % more β1 - integrins in the active conformation than parental cells ) ( * p < 0 . 05 ) ( Figure 2B ) . Further analysis was conducted to characterize Fibronectin expression between parental and bone homing clones of the MDA - MB - 231 cell line . Consistent with increased CD44 expression and increased activation of the β1 - integrin receptor pool , MDA - MB - 231BO cells were shown to have elevated levels of cellular - Fibronectin ( c - FN ) ( Figure 2A ) . Moreover , ELISA analysis confirmed a high level of Fibronectin secretion from MDA - MB - 231 cells than BMECs ( Figure 2C ) . MDA - MB - 231BO cells were also stimulated with HA to determine any association of HA with FN expression in these cells . Immunoblotting confirmed that HA increased the expression of c - FN within these metastatic BLBC cells ( Figure 2D ) . Consistent with the increased production of Fibronectin and increased integrin activation detected on bone - tropic MDA - MB - 231BO cells , these cells were also significantly more adherent to BMECs ( reported in [ 7 ] ) and Fibronectin than parental cells at all time points ( p < 0 . 05 ) ( Figure 2E ) . Talin facilitates CD44 - induced β1 - integrin activation in metastatic BLBC cells Further experiments were conducted to characterize the mechanism underpinning CD44 - promoted β1 - integrin activation . Talin is a known interacting protein with the cytoplasmic tail of the β1 - integrin . Using a series of gene - targeted siRNA strategies , we observed that knock - down of Talin attenuated the level of HA - induced β1 - integrin activation in MDA - MB - 231 cells , and was observed to be comparable to that observed in cells depleted of CD44 expression . Although HA stimulation increased expression of RHAMM , knockdown of this HA receptor using siRNA had no effect upon HA - stimulated activation of β1 - integrin receptors ( Figure 3A ) . In a further series of co - immunoprecipitation experiments , conducted in the absence and presence of a HA stimulus , we confirmed that both β1 - integrin and Talin associate with CD44 , and that the amount of these proteins associated with CD44 was potentiated following treatment with HA ( Figure 3B ) . This protein complex was further studied under talin - depleted conditions . Transfection with talin siRNA reduced the level of β1 - integrin in the anti - CD44 immunoprecipitate ( Figure 3C ) . These results suggest that talin is a key intermediate protein facilitating CD44 promoted association with β1 - integrin receptors and their activation . Cortactin and paxillin are key downstream signaling effectors of CD44 / integrin signaling in BLBC cells Immunoblotting was performed to characterize HA - induced signaling pathways activated in BLBC cells . The non - receptor tyrosine kinases Src and FAK are both known substrates of integrin signaling and have confirmed roles in modulating cell adhesion , spreading and motility . Initial analysis confirmed increased phosphorylation of Src and FAK in MDA - MB231BO cells relative to parental cells ( Figure 4A ) . Stimulation of MDA - MB - 231 with HA activated both these kinases ; a rapid onset and sustained phosphorylation of FAK was detected at multiple sites including the auto - phosphorylation site ( Tyr397 ) and the integrin - receptor engagement site ( Tyr861 ) , the later reaching a maximal level of phosphorylation between 30 and 45 min post - stimulation ( Figure 4B ) . Increased phosphorylation of Src was clearly apparent 10 min after HA stimulation . We next examined the impact of HA stimulation upon the downstream substrates of FAK and Src , the cytoskeletal - associated proteins cortactin and paxillin . Immunoblotting analysis of MDA - MB - 231 , Hs578T ( Figure 4C ) and PC3 cells ( Supplementary Figure S1C ) confirmed a time - dependent induction of Tyr421 phosphorylation in cortactin following addition of exogenous HA . Similarly , HA addition increased the phosphorylation of paxillin in each of these BLBC cells . Interestingly , we also observed that HA reproducibly increased the expression of this cytoskeletal protein in both BLBC cells . Immunoblotting confirmed a higher level of constitutive phosphorylation of cortactin ( Tyr421 ) and paxillin ( Tyr118 ) in the bone - selective metastatic cells relative to the parental MDA - MB - 231 counterpart ( Figure 4D ) . The mechanism underpinning HA - induced phosphorylation of paxillin was studied further . MDA - MB - 231BO cells were transfected with either a CD44 - targeted or cortactin siRNA oligonucleotide pool . Depletion of CD44 or cortactin each abrogated the HA - induced phosphorylation of paxillin , detected in response to a 10 min exposure to HA ( Figure 4E , left and right panels ) . The importance of integrin activation to HA - induced phosphorylation of cortactin and paxillin was also studied , comparing HA - induced cytoskeletal protein phosphorylation in the absence and presence of a function - blocking β1 - integrin antibody . Inhibition of β1 - integrin signaling attenuated HA - induced phosphorylation of cortactin , detected 10 , 20 and 40 min post - addition of the stimulus ( Figure 4F ) . Cortactin and paxillin underpin CD44 - promoted adhesion to endothelial monolayers and fibronectin Adhesion assays were performed to characterize the relationship of HA - induced signaling events to the CD44 - and integrin - promoted adhesion of tumor cells to BMECs and Fibronectin .

Depletion of CD44 , cortactin or paxillin expression also diminished adhesion of these cells to Fibronectin by 46 % , 39 % and 38 % ( * p < 0 . 05 ) , respectively ( Figure 5B ) . Treatment with an equivalent concentration of a non - targeting siRNA had no significant effect on adhesion of the cells to Fibronectin or BMECs . DISCUSSION Our study provides further characterization of the importance of CD44 in augmenting the adhesion of malignant cells to the vascular endothelium . Our observations also extend our understanding of CD44 - promoted adhesion , revealing a role for this receptor in initiating signaling events that promote cell adhesion to a matrix substrate Fibronectin , an ECM substrate reported to be enriched in the metastatic niche [ 17 ] . Using cell - based models of BLBC , we observe that exogenous HA administration initiates a cascade of CD44 - dependent events that both promote the expression and activation of specific integrin receptors to mediate adhesion . Biochemical and functional experiments demon - strate a complex inter - relationship of CD44 and the Fibronectin pathway . Firstly , immunoblotting and flow cytometry experiments confirm HA - induced CD44 signaling underpins a rapid increase in total and / or activated α5 - and β1 - integrin subunit expression in BLBC cells . The rapid changes in integrin expression that we observed may relate to characterized effect of CD44 signaling in activating downstream Akt , and Erk signaling [ 18 ] , which can regulate the rate of protein translation [ 19 , 20 ] . Secondly , we also confirm that HA can increase the synthesis of c - FN in these metastatic cells , at a time co - incident with the expression of the two integrin chains . This suggests that increased integrin receptor activation detected in HA - stimulated cells may in part relate to the promotion of “outside - in” signaling stemming from de novo Fibronectin synthesis . Thirdly , prior studies have reported that the cytoplasmic tail of CD44 is required for β1 - integrin activation [ 21 ] . In co - immunoprecipitation experiments , we demonstrate that exogenous HA increases the association of talin with CD44 , and the association of CD44 with the β1 - integrin chain . In addition , the formation of the CD44 - integrin - talin complex is enhanced upon exposure to HA . Moreover , the depletion of talin attenuated HA - induced integrin activation , confirming the role of this protein in mediating an “inside - out” HA - induced activation of integrin receptors . The association of CD44 , talin and β1 - integrin receptors in a potential “ternary” complex may explain the rapidity with which HA can induce receptor activation and downstream signal transduction in order to underpin cellular adhesion and / or motility . Furthermore , it is intriguing to note that Fibronectin is also reported to be a ligand for CD44 receptors [ 22 ] , suggesting that HA - initiated CD44 signalling may also potentiate a direct FN - CD44 interaction , in addition to stimulating an inside - out activation of integrin receptors to enhance FN engagement with breast cancer cells . In summary , our data and prior published observations suggest that CD44 signaling can increase the expression , promote rapid translocation [ 23 ] , and induce activation of integrin receptors [ 21 ] . This multi - modal regulation of integrin biology would be consistent with a strategy employed by a cell to rapidly modulate its adhesion to a favorable substrate or interface . Our observation that CD44 increases α5 - integrin and β1 - integrin expression is consistent with the increased efficiency of HA - stimulated malignant cells to augment adhesion not only to endothelial cells , but also to Fibronectin . Fibronectin is a major constituent of the pre - metastatic niche , and is present in both bone and lung metastases [ 17 ] . Other recent studies associate Fibronectin expression with increased tumor aggressiveness and poor clinical outcome in invasive breast cancers [ 24 ] . The capacity of HA and CD44 to promote synthesis of and adhesion to Fibronectin would be consistent with a more efficient colonization of the metastatic niche by invading BLBC cells and the promotion of adhesion - dependent outgrowth of secondary tumors . This improved adaptation to the microenvironment of the metastatic niche would be consistent with our recent observations that CD44 increases the efficiency of metastasis formed following systemic administration of MBA - MB - 231 cells [ 7 ] . Understanding the downstream signaling pathways driving CD44 and integrin promoted adhesion to endothelial cells and matrix proteins may identify opportunities to prevent and / or reduce the efficiency of metastasis outgrowth . Phosphorylation of cortactin and paxillin were shown to be important downstream effectors underpinning the CD44 - initiated , integrin - promoted cell - cell and cell - matrix adhesion of BLBC cells . Consistent with our observation that CD44 promotes distant tumor formation within the skeleton in vivo [ 7 ] , the over - expression and increased phosphorylation of cortactin have also been shown to potentiate the frequency of bone metastasis arising from the inoculation of MDA - MB - 231 breast cancer cells into athymic nude mice [ 25 ] . Moreover , our observation that two substrates of Src signaling , i . e . cortactin and paxillin , underpin CD44 - promoted adhesion and the positive correlation of CD44 to distant metastasis , is intriguing given the enrichment of Src activity detected in breast cancers with high propensity to spread to the bone [ 26 , 27 ] . This report provides further molecular evidence to support experimental data linking CD44 to a more efficient metastasis of breast cancer in vivo [ 7 , 28 ] . Studies from our research group alone provide evidence that not only does CD44 enable adhesion to distant endothelium and secondary tumor niches by promoting integrin - dependent signaling , Oncotarget 36770 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget Figure 5 : CD44 promoted cytoskeletal signaling mediates adhesion to endothelial monolayers and Fibronectin - enriched matrices .

All data is the mean ± S . E . M of three at least three independent experiments ( * p < 0 . 05 ; calculated by two - tailed t - test analysis ) . Oncotarget 36771 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget CD44 also facilitates local invasion through up - regulation of uPA , metalloproteinase and cathepsin proteolytic activity in BLBC cells [ 6 ] . Furthermore , we and others have detected elevation of CD44 in the poor prognostic basal subtype of breast cancer or stem - like tumor cells that have disseminated to the bone marrow [ 5 – 8 ] . In contrast , other recent immunohistochemical studies suggest that CD44 expression correlates with a favorable patient outcome [ 29 ] . Therefore , given the known complexity of this glycoprotein with respect to its structural biology and its biological diversity , and the distinct clinical outcomes that have been reported , CD44 is unlikely to have clinical utility as a singular prognostic marker . However , future studies should address whether the analysis of CD44 , increased FN and α5β1 - integrin receptor expression and a cohort of other CD44 - affiliated metastasis - associated genes ( e . g . cortactin , MT1 - MMP , cathepsin K , and uPA ) , may provide a more robust prognostic signature to differentiate clinical outcome and predict patient outcome . In summary , we demonstrate the capacity of HA - induced CD44 - mediated signaling to increase the efficiency of integrin - mediated adhesion of metastatic breast cancer cells to vascular endothelium and Fibronectin - enriched matrices . The capacity to increase cell - cell and cell - matrix adhesion is consistent with our observations that CD44 increases the efficiency of distant metastasis of basal - like breast cancer in vivo . Further investigations are required to address the endothelial cell counter - ligands that engage the activated integrin - receptors detected on the surface of these FN - secreting , CD44 - enriched BLBCs to facilitate endothelial cell arrest and adhesion .

CD44 depleted luciferase - expressing MDA - MB - 231 cells from Caliper Life Sciences ( Cheshire , UK ) were generated in our laboratory by stable transfection with CD44 shRNA or non - targeting shRNA control as previously described [ 7 ] and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10 % v / v FCS , 0 . 2 μg / ml puromycin . All cell lines were grown to 70 % confluence prior to experimentation . Human bone marrow endothelial cells ( BMEC ) were provided by Dr Babette Weksler ( Cornell University , NY ) and cultured as previously described [ 10 ] . Invasion and adhesion assays Cell invasion and adhesion were assayed as described previously [ 6 , 11 ] . Flow cytometry Cells were fixed in 1 % paraformaldehyde and stained with HUTS4 and B44 antibodies according to manufacturer’s instructions followed by detection with FITC - conjugated secondary antibody ( Dako , Ely . UK ) . Data was acquired with a FACSCantoII ( BD Biosciences , Oxford , UK ) and analysed using FlowJo software . Isotype - controls were used to determine baseline parameters in these experiments . SDS - PAGE and western - blotting Cell lysates ( 20 μg ) were separated by SDS - PAGE and transferred onto immobilon - P PVDF membranes ( Millipore , Billerica , MA , USA ) . Membranes were blocked for 1 h at RT in Tris - buffered saline / 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 ( TBS - T ) containing 5 % ( v / v ) dried milk . Incubation with primary antibody was carried out at 4°C overnight . Membranes were washed three times in TBS - T and then incubated for 1 h with the appropriate horse - radish peroxidase ( HRP ) - labeled secondary antibody . Following three washes in TBS - T , immunoreactivity was detected using SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate ( Pierce Biotechnology , Rockford , IL , USA ) followed by exposure to X - ray film . Note , for detection of activated β1 - integrins , lysates were electrophoresed on 7 . 5 % SDS - PAGE gels under non - reducing conditions as detailed previously [ 16 ] . Co - immunoprecipitation 1 mg cell lysate was incubated overnight at 4°C with 5 μg of mouse anti - CD44 or IgG2A ( 50 mM Tris [ pH 8 . 0 ] , 5 mM EDTA , 1 % CHAPS , protease inhibitor cocktail ) . Immune complexes were precipitated using 20 μL sheep Oncotarget 36772 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget anti - mouse dynabeads ( Invitrogen ) for 2 h followed by three washes with immunoprecipitation buffer . Eluted samples and analyzed by Western - blotting for CD44 , β1 - integrin or Talin . Fluorescence microscopy Cells fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde were stained according to antibody manufacturer’s instructions and detected with TRITC – conjugated donkey anti - mouse ( Jackson ImmunoResearch , Newmarket , UK ) . Nuclei were counterstained with 300 nmol / L DAPI ( Molecular Probes , Life Technologies , Paisley , UK ) . Slides were mounted using Vectashield ( Vector Laboratories , Peterborough , UK ) and viewed with LSM 510 META NLO confocal microscope ( Zeiss , Cambridge , UK ) . Isotype - controls were used to set baseline paremeters in these experiments . RNAi suppression of CD44 , cortactin and paxillin CD44 / cortactin / paxillin expression was suppressed using validated RNAi oligonucleotide pools ( SMARTpool ® , GE Dharmacon , Lafayette , CO ) . Cells were transfected using DharmaFECT2 for 72 h prior to experimentation . Fibronectin ELISA Fibronectin ELISA was obtained from Millipore and was used according to manufacturer’s instructions . Statistical analysis For all in vitro analysis , significance was analyzed using a two - tailed Student’s t - test . Analysis was performed by comparing interventional arms to both untreated / unstimulated controls and the isotype - control arms , although statistical data reported in the manuscript relates to the isotype - control or vehicle control arms .
