ORIGINAL ARTICLE Open Access Enhancing Uterine Fibroid Care : Clinician Perspectives on Diagnosis , Disparities , and Strategies for Improving Health Care Alfu Laily , 1 Isha Nair , 2 Sophie E . Shank , 1 Cameron Wettschurack , 2 Grace Khamis , 2 Chandler Dykstra , 3 Andrea L . DeMaria , 1 and Monica L . Kasting 1 , * Abstract Objective : To explore clinicians’ perspectives on diagnosing , treating , and managing uterine ﬁbroids , identifying gaps and challenges in health care delivery , and offering recommendations for improving care . Materials and Methods : A qualitative design was used to conduct 14 semistructured interviews with clinicians who treat ﬁbroid patients in central Indiana . Interviews were audio recorded , transcribed verbatim , and analyzed using thematic analysis techniques . Constant comparative analysis was used to identify emergent themes . Results : Four themes emerged . ( 1 ) Lack of patient ﬁbroid awareness : Patients lacked ﬁbroid awareness , leading to challenges in explaining diagnoses and treatment . Misconceptions and emotional distress highlighted the need for better education . ( 2 ) Inequities in care and access : Health care disparities affected Black women and rural patients , with transportation , scheduling delays , and ﬁnancial constraints hindering access . ( 3 ) Continuum of care : Clinicians prioritized patient - centered care and shared decision - making , tailoring treatment based on fac - tors like severity , location , size , cost , fertility goals , and recovery time . ( 4 ) Coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) impact : The pandemic posed challenges and opportunities , prompting telehealth adoption and consideration of nonsurgical options . Conclusions : Clinician perspectives noted patient challenges with ﬁbroids , prompting calls for enhanced edu - cation , interdisciplinary collaboration , and accessible care to address crucial aspects of ﬁbroid management and improve women’s well - being . Practice Implications : Clinicians identiﬁed a lack of patient awareness and unequal access to ﬁbroid care , high - lighting the need for improved education and addressing disparities . Findings also emphasized the importance of considering multidimensional aspects of ﬁbroid care and adapting to challenges posed by the COVID - 19 pan - demic , recommending broader education , affordability , interdisciplinary collaboration , and research for better ﬁbroid health care . 1 Department of Public Health , College of Health and Human Sciences , Purdue University , West Lafayette , Indiana , USA . 2 School of Health Sciences , College of Health and Human Sciences , Purdue University , West Lafayette , Indiana , USA . 3 Marian University College of Osteopathic Medicine , Indianapolis , Indiana , USA . * Address correspondenceto : Monica L .

Women’s Health Reports Volume 5 . 1 , 2024 DOI : 10 . 1089 / whr . 2023 . 0113 Accepted January 29 , 2024 293 Keywords : clinical care ; clinicians ; health disparities ; qualitative ; uterine ﬁbroids , women’s health Introduction Uterine ﬁbroids—benign tumors of the uterus— account for over $ 34 billion in annual diagnostic and treatment costs in the United States , 1 surpassing the annual cost of breast , colon , or ovarian cancers . 2 Ute - rine ﬁbroids ( hereafter referred to as ﬁbroids ) affect 65 % of U . S . women and 70 % – 80 % of global women by age 50 . 3 , 4 Fibroids lead to most gynecologic hospital - izations and hysterectomies in the United States . 5 Although non - metastatic and commonly asymptom - atic , they could manifest into chronic symptoms in up to 50 % of reproductive - age women , impacting their quality of life . 4 Symptomatic patients usually ex - hibit heavy menstrual bleeding and prolonged men - strual cycles ( 59 % ) , abdominal pain ( 74 % ) , constipation ( 64 % ) , and bladder disruptions ( 59 % ) . 6 Risk factors for developing ﬁbroids include early menarche , nulliparity , delayed pregnancy , obesity , hy - pertension , age , race , and family history . 7 – 9 In addition , Black women have an increased risk of ﬁbroid develop - ment , 7 , 9 and they experience two - to - three times greater incidence and more severe symptoms than White women . 5 , 10 , 11 Black women are also less likely to re - ceive ﬁbroid treatment than White women , 12 indicat - ing signiﬁcant health disparities . Despite the extensive negative impact of ﬁbroids , health care and treatment are often delayed for years due to a lack of awareness . 13 Almost half of the women at the time of diagnosis were unaware of ﬁ - broids and associated health issues . 4 Limited knowl - edge of ﬁbroids and normal menstruation may lead women to a false sense of normalcy , delaying disease recognition and health care - seeking behavior . 4 This lack of awareness prolongs the time to clinical diagno - sis , potentially requiring more invasive treatment options—a consequence that cannot only be ﬁnan - cially costly but also signiﬁcantly impact the quality of life . 14 , 15 Improving ﬁbroid awareness aligns with patient - centered research to better understand wom - en’s experiences , ensuring tailored ﬁbroid treatment and management options with patients’ overall needs and desires . 16 , 17 Due to the varying presentation of ﬁbroids , clini - cians must individualize treatment plans for many fac - tors , including the number , size , and location of ﬁbroids , severity , and patient’s goals and preferences for treatment outcomes . 7 , 18 Exploring how clinicians diagnose , treat , and manage ﬁbroids is particularly im - portant given recent ﬁndings demonstrating a signiﬁ - cant reduction in symptoms and increased quality of life following surgical and / or nonsurgical treatment for affected women . 13 Furthermore , most current re - search on this topic is limited to quantitative method - ology , which does not fully capture participants’ experiences and personal narratives . Therefore , this study utilized a qualitative approach to explore clini - cians’ perspectives on diagnosing , treating , and manag - ing uterine ﬁbroids , identifying gaps and challenges in health care delivery , and offering recommendations for improving patient care . Materials and Methods In this qualitative study , 14 semistructured interviews were conducted with clinicians in central Indiana to capture their experiences in diagnosing and treating ﬁ - broid patients , aiming to understand their perspectives on ﬁbroid health care . Recruitment Eligible participants included Obstetrics and Gynecol - ogies ( OB / GYNs ) , family physicians , and fertility spe - cialists practicing in central Indiana , USA . Recruitment occurred from May 2021 to January 2023 through email , the Indiana CTSI mailing list , and peer referrals . Clinicians completed a screening questionnaire and demographic survey . Informed con - sent , including audio recording permission , was obtained electronically and verbally before interviews . Research protocols were approved by the ﬁrst author’s institutional review board . Interviews We conducted 14 web - based or phone call interviews with clinicians , each lasting * 30 minutes ( 31 . 2 – 0 . 4 ) . Four researchers ( I . N . , S . S . , C . K . , C . D . ) took turns serv - ing as interviewers and notetakers . Three interviews were conducted by a single interviewer , while 11 inter - views were conducted with 1 interviewer and 1 note - taker . Semistructured interview guides found in Supplementary S1 were used to provide ﬂexibility and encourage open conversations . The interview topics were meticulously determined through an extensive Laily , et al . ; Women’s Health Reports 2024 , 5 . 1 http : / / online . liebertpub . com / doi / 10 . 1089 / whr . 2023 . 0113 294 review of relevant literature and initial discussions with ﬁbroid patients involved in this overarching project . 19 Interviews covered various topics , including diagnosis , psychological and social impact , treatment , patient ed - ucation , and health care disparities . These topic selec - tions played a pivotal role in shaping the interview guide , ensuring comprehensive coverage of a diverse range of relevant themes . It is crucial to note that the emergence of themes dur - ing the interviews was not dictated by the preestablished topics ; rather , the guide served as a ﬂexible framework to maintain consistency across interviews , allowing partic - ipants to share their experiences and insights . Clinicians received a $ 50 gift card incentive for their participation . We will present quotes from our participants along with the interview identiﬁcation number and clinical spe - cialty , such as ( 114 - OB / GYN ) , after each quote . Analysis We utilized thematic analysis and techniques for a con - stant comparative approach to data analysis . 20 , 21 Our thematic analysis approach guided us in identifying , organizing , and analyzing data in multiple systematic phases . 20 , 22 After transcribing all interviews verbatim in three rounds ( used Otter . AI then followed by two rounds of manual transcriptions ) , we conducted an immersive data content review to ensure uniform fa - miliarity among researchers . 20 Then , a ‘‘dualistic’’ de - ductive / inductive approach was used for codebook development to foster a greater data representa - tion . 23 , 24 The codebook book was developed based on interview guides , initial reading of transcripts , and existing literature . We used HyperRESEARCH 4 . 5 . 1 to conduct multiple rounds of open and axial coding until saturation was reached . 20 , 21 , 25 A . L . led codebook development , and A . L . , I . N . , S . S . , G . K . , and C . K . per - formed coding . Meetings were held among the coders to ensure interrater reliability . Coded data were organized into potential themes / subthemes , represented visually in a thematic map , and underwent multistage validation . 20 Thematic de - velopment was data - driven with minimum relation to the original research questions or ‘‘analytic preconcep - tions . ’’ 20 , 22 We further ‘‘reﬁned and deﬁned’’ theme content and names to guarantee data accurately and sufﬁciently portray each theme’s ‘‘essence’’ or identi - ty . 20 We met biweekly to discuss research progress , evaluate thematic development , and engage in ‘‘peer debrieﬁng’’ to ensure that all aspects of data were thor - oughly exposed and analyzed . 22 Results Participant characteristics In this study , the participants had a mean age of 39 . 57 years ( standard deviation [ SD ] = 6 . 37 ) and a mean of 12 . 21 years ( SD = 6 . 34 ) of experience working in the women’s health care area . The majority identiﬁed as heterosexual / straight ( 92 . 8 % ; n = 13 ) . Regarding race and ethnicity , 71 . 4 % were White or Caucasian ( n = 10 ) , and 85 . 7 % were not Hispanic ( n = 12 ) . Profes - sionally , 78 . 6 % specialized in OB / GYN ( n = 11 ) , while other specialties included Family Medicine ( 7 . 1 % ; n = 1 ) , Women’s Health ( 7 . 1 % ; n = 1 ) , and Minimally Invasive GYN Surgery ( 7 . 1 % ; n = 1 ) . Clinician types comprised 78 . 6 % physicians ( n = 11 ) and 21 . 4 % nurse practitioners ( n = 3 ) . About 28 . 6 % ( n = 4 ) worked in a federally qualiﬁed health center .

Additional quotes can be found in Table 2 for reference . Lack of patient ﬁbroid awareness Clinicians stated that most patients do not know what ﬁbroids are and have difﬁculty grasping their diagnosis because ‘‘ it’s just a big struggle trying to explain exactly what a ﬁbroid is . ’’ ( 110 - OB / GYN ) . One participant de - scribed how ‘‘ even if they come with a diagnosis of ﬁ - broids , sometimes they don’t even know what that means . ’’ ( 112 - OB / GYN ) . With minimal patient aware - ness , clinicians usually initiated conversations about ﬁ - broids , except where ‘‘ the patient has a family history ’’ ( 114 - OB / GYN ) . Misunderstandings of ﬁbroid physiol - ogy propel the formation of a variety of misconceptions . Interviews gathered misconceptions such as ‘‘ the only treatment is surgery ’’ ( 109 - OB / GYN ) , ‘‘ they’re danger - ous or life - threatening ’’ ( 112 - OB / GYN ) , ‘‘ they [ always ] cause infertility ’’ ( 105 - OB / GYN ) , and ‘‘ have to take my ovaries out ’’ ( 104 - OB / GYN ) . Further challenges were noted when clinicians described the range of treat - ment options , as one participant reported : ‘‘I get sent those patients , but they have no symptoms from them . And now trying to explain what they are and also trying to explain why we don’t have to do anything and what the nat - ural history of ﬁbroids are . That’s when people get a little con - fused , [ they are like ] ‘okay , there’s a growth in my uterus , but you don’t want to do anything about it ? ’’ ( 110 - OB / GYN ) . Patients frequently reacted emotionally after their diagnosis , as described by one clinician , ‘‘ people gener - ally freak out when I tell them they have ﬁbroids ’’ ( 105 - OB / GYN ) . This was attributed to the lack of awareness of what ﬁbroids are and the assumption by the patient that the diagnosis of a ﬁbroid meant a cancer diagnosis , ‘‘ everybody just starts panicking because everybody as - sumes cancer . ’’ ( 110 - OB / GYN ) . Language barriers , minimal health literacy , and a low range of information distribution only to ﬁbroid patients challenged com - munication effectiveness . One participant noted , ‘‘ be - cause of a language barrier , which is very common , sometimes maybe information isn’t relayed 100 % . ’’ ( 106 - Nurse Practitioner [ NP ] ) . Others struggled with delivering full explanations to patients , ‘‘ the patient’s level of health literacy , [ you ] don’t want to talk to them as if they don’t know anything . ’’ ( 113 - NP ) . Clinicians primarily target ﬁbroid - related information for diagnosed patients , rather than providing information to those without diagnosis but at high risk of developing ﬁbroid . One clinician explained , ‘‘ speciﬁc information about ﬁbroids is for patients who have the ﬁbroids . ’’ ( 110 - OB / GYN ) . Lack of ﬁbroid awareness burdens pa - tients misunderstanding their diagnosis , concluding mis - conceptions , and experiencing emotional distress . Inequities in ﬁbroid - related care and access Clinicians frequently noted difﬁculties obtaining trans - portation to appointments : ‘‘ A lot of patients in this community tend to have transportation issues . [ . . ] that can make it difﬁcult to provide the best care ’’ ( 112 - OB / GYN ) . Most clinicians correctly noted that Black women are disproportionately impacted , ‘‘ There is a tendency for African American women to have a higher likelihood or indices for developing ﬁbroids . ’’ ( 112 - OB / GYN ) . Clinicians also described patients of lower so - cioeconomic status as having difﬁculty affording treat - ment : ‘‘ There’s a fair amount of patients who are ﬁnancially in difﬁcult situations , and sometimes that creates an issue primarily with being able to afford med - ications ’’ ( 107 - OB / GYN ) . Clinicians noted scheduling delays for appoint - ments , with one reporting that it could be ‘‘ upwards of two to three months out depending on if they’re new ’’ ( 113 - NP ) , while another said a patient could be seen ‘‘ probably within a month if they’re established . ’’ ( 111 - OB / GYN ) . Even for patients who can see their cli - nicians , there are often delays in care due to long wait times for test results because health systems are ‘‘ pretty behind on imaging . ’’ ( 105 - OB / GYN ) . This problem is exacerbated in rural communities as one clinician noted that ‘‘ because there’s a small com - munity , sometimes there’s a higher demand for us than we’re able to supply . ’’ ( 113 - NP ) . One participant mentioned that patients travel farther to their clinic for ﬁnancial beneﬁts , saying ‘‘ [ patients ] come to [ my hos - pital ] because of how we do our insurance and put them on a sliding scale based on their income . ’’ ( 106 - NP ) . Finan - cial concerns were commonly mentioned , with some clinicians noting social workers to assist patients , ‘‘ we try and make sure that the ﬁnancial impact just from a health insurance perspective is minimized . ’’ ( 110 - OB / GYN ) . This participant continued to mention costs out - side their control , noting the ‘‘ loss of income from when they recover from their surgeries . ’’ ( 110 - OB / GYN ) . These health care system components challenge many patients trying to access fundamental ﬁbroid care . Uterine ﬁbroid continuum of care Shared decision - making . Clinicians used ‘‘ a patient - centered approach to essentially every patient and Laily , et al . ; Women’s Health Reports 2024 , 5 . 1 http : / / online . liebertpub . com / doi / 10 . 1089 / whr . 2023 . 0113 296 Table 2 . Participant Additional Quotes Theme Subtheme Exemplar quote Lack of patient awarenessofﬁbroids — I think there’s an equal number of women who get sent to me because of asymptomatic fibroids that were diagnosed on imaging , and they had no idea . And some of them are fairly significant . You know , 10 , 12 , you know , centimeter fibroid , they had no idea [ 107 , OB / GYN ] . Patients who have symptoms completely unrelated to the ﬁbroid that had an ultrasound or imaging done in the emergency room or by primary care and they’re like , ‘‘Oh , you have a , you know , two - centimeter ﬁbroid . Go to gynecology’’ [ 105 , OB / GYN ] . I think the biggest misconception is that they absolutely have to come out . Um , so they’re benign , they can stay in there or they can come out it doesn’t really matter [ 104 , OB / GYN ] . They think it’s cancer . They think it’s like some form of cancer that’s cancer and then that they could like die from it or that they have to get a hysterectomy for it where it’s not necessarily the case [ 113 , NP ] . They’re like , ‘‘Aha , this is why I have infertility . ’’ And it probably isn’t most of the time . So , I think that’s one misconception [ 105 , OB / GYN ] . Anytime you mention that there’s tumors in the uterus everybody just starts panicking because everybody assumes cancer [ 110 , OB / GYN ] . Generally , the patients who are symptomatic is who I give information to [ 103 , NP ] . I mean speciﬁc information about ﬁbroids is for patients who have the ﬁbroids [ 110 , OB / GYN ] . The big challenge is trying , language services . Trying to get an interpreter for a language , and then the Wi - Fi goes out . Or there’s only one interpreter available [ 104 , OB / GYN ] . Inequities in ﬁbroid - related care and access — Because of a language barrier , which is very common , sometimes maybe information isn’t relayed 100 % [ 106 , OB / GYN ] . We have a large Haitian Creole population , but we don’t have much resources in that language as far as handouts are explaining things that we would give like our English or Spanish speaking patients [ 106 , OB / GYN ] . The majority of big issues with ﬁbroids are African Americans . [ 109 , OB / GYN ] We had a larger African American population where we trained , that’s deﬁnitely the population that’s most impacted by ﬁbroids compared to um other races [ 113 , NP ] They don’t have a care provider down in that county , and that’s probably * a 40 - minute drive [ 114 , OB / GYN ] . I have a probably 5 % , 10 % in travel from outside of the state [ 102 , Minimally Invasive Gynecology Surgery ] . We don’t have access here to like a what we call a gynecological oncologist , like a GYN oncologist doctor in the community . And a lot of patients in this community tend to have transportation issues . [ 112 , OB / GYN ] . Patients have trouble with sometimes follow up and keeping appointments for a variety of reasons , including transportation and inability to take time off work [ 105 , OB / GYN ] . We try and make sure that the ﬁnancial impact just from a health insurance perspective is minimized . What we cannot help with is this loss of income from when they recover from their surgeries [ 110 , OB / GYN ] . On average it’s probably about three months [ for appointment wait ] . [ 110 , OB / GYN ] . Uterine ﬁbroids continuumofcare Shared decision - making So , you need to understand , like really , how much does this affect your day to day life , is it a nuisance or not . And then also , you know , based on where the fibroids are located , changes how we might manage them [ 102 , Minimally Invasive Gynecology Surgery ] . We’ll come up with a treatment plan so my patients , I , you know , I let them decide what you know really what’s gonna work for them [ 101 , OB / GYN ] . I would probably suggest medication versus putting them through a major surgery just because there just not a good candidate for surgery [ 113 , NP ] . If she is seeking fertility , then that dictates the discussion as far as management options [ 109 , OB / GYN ] . I will counsel her if she says , Well , I want to wait and see and she has a 20 - centimeter ﬁbroid , and she’s bleeding a lot and she has anemia . And we will talk this is probably not the best option at this time [ 109 , OB / GYN ] . Then how signiﬁcantly it’s been affecting and how long it’s been affecting their life [ 113 , NP ] . I take a patient centered approach to essentially every patient and personalize everything to the particular patient [ 104 , OB / GYN ] . What are their values , and then I listed them all the options available and talk to them about which ones are best for the values that they expressed , but let them know all the options in case they want to do something different [ 103 , NP ] . Once we’ve gone over all the different options , you know , sort of a shared decision - making process with the patient , as to how we want to move forward [ 102 , Minimally Invasive Gynecology Surgery ] ( continued ) 297 personalize everything to the particular patient . ’’ ( 104 - OB / GYN ) . Clinicians emphasized that the treatment option had ‘‘ to be a mutual agreement . ’’ ( 109 - OB / GYN ) , and that they would ‘‘ have a little bit more de - tailed discussion that probably [ the patient ] may need to consider [ a different treatment option ] ’’ ( 109 - OB / GYN ) . Many perceived their patients as satisﬁed with the information received for their decision - making : ‘‘ I haven’t got any complaints so far that anybody is not happy with the information we provide ’’ ( 109 - OB / GYN ) . In contrast , others noted dissatisfaction when patients have ‘‘ an adverse , like a side effect ’’ ( 106 - NP ) , which was common . At times , patients ‘‘ just switched doctors [ because ] they decided they don’t want to see me ’’ ( 101 - OB / GYN ) . Overall , shared decision - making was emphasized to provide the best possible care for pa - tients . Treatment decision factors . Clinicians mentioned that the ﬁbroids’ severity , location , and size inﬂuenced treatment discussions , stating ‘‘ it depends on patient , patient desires , plus where they are in terms of like , how severe their diagnosis is . ’’ ( 113 - NP ) and ‘‘ tell a pa - tient about every treatment out there that I know of for Table 2 . ( Continued ) Theme Subtheme Exemplar quote Treatment decision factors And then also , you know , based on where the fibroids are located , changes how we might manage them [ 102 , Minimally Invasive Gynecology Surgery ] . It depends on location of the ﬁbroids and what the presenting symptom is [ 104 , OB / GYN ] . How much is it gonna cost ? [ 106 , OB / GYN ] A big deciding point is the desire for future fertility . And how soon [ 104 , OB / GYN ] . Absence of needed care Social burden that’s a little bit different subject that if you’re talking socially , like cost , money , visits and stuff like that , I personally do not go through that aspects [ 104 , OB / GYN ] . If there is a problem , where I feel my staff can help , probably I’ll refer them to a social worker [ 109 , OB / GYN ] . I personally do not get involved in non - medical stuff [ 109 , OB / GYN ] . COVID - 19 pandemic and ﬁbroids care Patients were less likely to come into a medical office for fear of getting COVID . So , they delayed the treatment [ 112 , OB / GYN ] . People that weren’t able to get in for care that were probably having , you know , symptomatic ﬁbroids , that , that maybe grew bigger for longer because they couldn’t get in [ 111 , OB / GYN ] . I think using telemedicine more like both for the convenience of like patients and providers . better than not being seen at all [ 114 , OB / GYN ] . Pandemic showed that there are other ways to , to handle it um than just surgical options [ 113 , NP ] . More medical and conservative options probably given during the pandemic compared to now [ 113 , NP ] . Recommendationsforﬁbroidcareimprovement Broaden patient education Public health programs that will discuss fibroids because it’s a huge , I mean , abdominal uterine bleeding is the number one reason why women in their early 40s , late 30s present , um , for specific GYN care [ 110 , OB / GYN ] . Largest need is education [ 112 , OB / GYN ] . It would be great if they were given the information and then saw me . I think that would be much more beneﬁcial if they had the background information on ﬁbroids [ 104 , OB / GYN ] . It’s education . Because like I said , my patient population , half the patients have never even heard the term [ 112 , OB / GYN ] . Other significant needs A place that’s kind of only focuses on fibroids , like if there were like certain clinics that just do fibroids [ 103 , NP ] . The big push has been to try and ﬁnd ways that are as minimally invasive as possible [ 110 , OB / GYN ] . But having child care and elder care and family care and things like that , so that these patients who either have signiﬁcant symptoms from their ﬁbroids or surgery , can have time to recover . I think that’s a huge need [ 104 , OB / GYN ] . Offering behavioral health like therapy for that is very important . Infertility is difﬁcult thing for people to handle [ 105 , OB / GYN ] . More physician training programs , speciﬁcally , obstetrics training programs focus on , I mean , we always focus on medical treatments and what’s new and what’s out there [ 112 , OB / GYN ] . I would say , um , maybe incorporating baseline female health education in school systems [ 112 , OB / GYN ] . COVID - 19 , coronavirus disease 2019 ; NP , nurse practitioner .

And then we kind of funnel down to , based on your ﬁbroids and their size and their location . ’’ ( 102 - Minimally Invasive Gynecologic Surgeon [ MIGS ] ) . Cost was often cited as a reason a patient would opt for a certain treatment plan : ‘‘ a lot of patients are like , ‘well , how much is it gonna cost ? ’’ ( 106 - NP ) . Fertility and family planning goals also inﬂuenced treatment decisions , with one clinician noting ‘‘ if she is seeking fertility , then that dictates the discussion as far as management options . ’’ ( 109 - OB / GYN ) . Patients preferred treatments with shorter recovery times to return to ‘‘normal’’ more quickly . Common patient questions related to ‘‘ the recovery time period , the access to minimally invasive surgical procedures that will re - duce recovery length . ’’ ( 110 - OB / GYN ) . Absence of needed care . Even though clinicians mentioned various symptoms caused by ﬁbroids that impact quality of life , several stated that they had no re - liable approach to address the multidimensional ( i . e . , social , emotional , mental ) aspects of ﬁbroid care . In addition to being costly , ﬁbroids impact everyday activities : ‘‘Those who have heavy bleeding [ . . ] have issues with being at work or out , you know , doing their daily activities and bleeding through their clothing , and having to go home and change , can be disruptive to their sex lives . ’’ ( 102 - MIGS ) . Despite these impacts , when clinicians were asked if they address multidimensional aspects of ﬁbroids , many offered none : ‘‘ Oh , I would say zero ’’ ( 104 - OB / GYN ) . Some noted it was uncommon to provide this type of care , but when it was needed , they would give a referral : ‘‘ I haven’t been involved in a lot of those cases , I can ask my staff to help the patient through a so - cial service worker ’’ ( 109 - OB / GYN ) . Clinicians reveal further ways to improve care by focusing more on the multidimensional aspects of ﬁbroids . Coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and ﬁbroid care . The coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) pan - demic challenged how patients sought care and their interest in treatment options . One clinician recounted how a patient declined surgery due to mandatory pre - surgery COVID testing because they believed that the ‘‘ COVID test would give them COVID ’’ ( 113 - NP ) . Clini - cians also recalled issues with stafﬁng , such as ‘‘ having enough staff , healthy and available , to be able to see enough patients . ’’ ( 112 - OB / GYN ) . Alternatively , the pandemic did lead to some posi - tive changes in ﬁbroid care , including telehealth , which many clinicians spoke of highly . As one explained , it allowed them to ‘‘ac tually reach some of these patients who we otherwise , maybe weren’t able to reach pre - pandemic ’’ ( 102 - MIGS ) . Clinicians felt the pandemic exposed alternatives to handle ﬁbroids , pushing patients and clinicians to consider ‘‘ medical and non - medical options [ as they were ] less apt to jump into surgical options ’’ ( 113 - NP ) . The pandemic has had a multifaceted impact on ﬁbroid care . Recommendations for ﬁbroid care improvement Broaden patient education . Clinicians mentioned ‘‘ half the patients have never even heard the term [ ﬁ - broids ] ’’ ( 112 , OB / GYN ) , and recommended , ‘‘ I would love it if they had [ ﬁbroid ] information available to pa - tients on healthcare system websites . So : 1 ) it could be reputable and 2 ) easily accessible to anyone who had questions ’’ ( 102 - MIGS ) . One clinician described a pref - erence for ﬁbroid education during routine gynecologic care visits for all women , ‘‘ in well woman visits , touch on topics that affect women just so they know when to come in to see us . ’’ ( 113 - NP ) . Finally , one clinician of - fered up how other ﬁelds should get involved , ‘‘ public health programs [ should ] discuss ﬁbroids ’’ ( 110 - OB / GYN ) , noting an opportunity for population - based education to broaden awareness . Other signiﬁcant needs . Fibroids affect patients ‘‘ cer - tainly ﬁnancially , you know , here’s a patient who’s missing work already because of the symptoms . ’’ ( 102 - MIGS ) . For this reason , clinicians advocated that ﬁ - broid care be more affordable and that ‘‘ some of the stuff that could be cheaper , less expensive . ’’ ( 101 - OB / GYN ) . Furthermore , clinicians endorsed expanding in - surance coverage of treatment options , saying ‘‘ this medication [ . . ] sounds great . But it’s not covered by in - surance . And a lot of patients ask for it . I think coverage of those medications will be the most important thing . ’’ ( 113 - NP ) . Clinicians advocated for better collaboration , as ﬁ - broid care needs a broader scope of specialist partner - ships . One clinician stated , ‘‘ I feel like ﬁbroids sometimes takes multiple specialties , so having some of those net - works pre - made [ . ] could be helpful . ’’ ( 103 - OB / GYN ) . Moreover , they promoted the importance of continuing research on ﬁbroid prevention , as one questioned ‘‘ how to prevent women from even developing them in the ﬁrst place ’’ ( 102 - MIGS ) , and urged ﬁnding more minimally invasive treatments , claiming ‘‘ the big push has been to try and ﬁnd ways that are as minimally invasive as Laily , et al . ; Women’s Health Reports 2024 , 5 . 1 http : / / online . liebertpub . com / doi / 10 . 1089 / whr . 2023 . 0113 299 possible . ’’ ( 110 - OB / GYN ) . Moving forward , clinicians advocated for more affordable care , further ﬁbroid re - search , and improved dissemination . Discussion We explored ﬁbroid health care delivery by conducting 14 interviews with Indiana - based clinicians , uncover - ing gaps in diagnosis , management , and patient sup - port . Education and awareness emerged as critical factors for improving ﬁbroid care , addressing the sub - stantial impact on patients’ well - being . Addressing ﬁ - broid care is crucial to ensuring women’s well - being , reducing health care disparities , and enhancing overall health care access . Despite the high prevalence of ﬁbroids , clinicians ob - served low awareness of ﬁbroids before diagnosis . Our ﬁndings suggested that some clinicians prefer distribut - ing ﬁbroid information exclusively to diagnosed pa - tients , which may contribute to low ﬁbroid awareness , highlighting the potential beneﬁt of adopt - ing an approach to provide ﬁbroid information to all women during routine gynecological visits , as recom - mended by some other clinicians in our study . This lack of patient awareness challenged clinicians to guide management options , predominantly when patients were asymptomatic and required minimal or no intervention . While ‘‘watchful waiting’’ was suitable for asymptomatic patients without immediate treat - ment needs , 26 clinicians reported that their patients were dissatisﬁed and preferred more active interven - tion . Moreover , clinicians voiced that women struggled to comprehend the term ‘‘benign , ’’ often mistaking it for cancerous , which aligns with previous work , 27 sug - gesting the need for improved terminology during ini - tial conversations . To bridge this gap , clinician – patient communication and education should be fostered to avoid negative care experiences potentially affecting care engagement . 19 , 28 Clinicians reported several health disparities in ﬁ - broid care , resulting in delayed treatment and poor health outcomes . Our clinicians noted that Black women experienced worse health outcomes than their White counterparts , potentially due to delayed care seeking , aligning with previous research . 7 , 9 Concerns were also raised about rural patients lacking access to specialists , leading to longer travel and wait times , de - terring timely treatment . In 24 out of 92 Indiana coun - ties , OB / GYN services were absent , 29 indicating that women in rural areas must travel longer to reach clini - cians with the necessary expertise and resources for ﬁbroid treatment . In addition , clinicians voiced that high demand for care did not match clinician availabil - ity , resulting in longer waits and missed appointments in rural areas . To address disparities between rural and urban areas , targeted efforts are needed to improve ac - cess to specialist services in underserved regions , like incentives for rural specialists and remote consulta - tions , 30 , 31 supporting equitable access to ﬁbroid care . Despite clinicians recognizing the adverse impact of ﬁ - broid symptoms on patients’ quality of life , they provided minimal or no resources to address ﬁnancial , psycholog - ical , or social issues arising from the condition . Clinicians acknowledged that patients suffer ﬁnancial - related issues , such as difﬁculty affording medications and unpaid work - leave , preventing timely and routine care . Further - more , psychosocial issues from ﬁbroid symptoms also disrupt daily life ( e . g . , stress from sex - life disruptions , embarrassment due to heavy bleeding ) . However , they felt addressing anything beyond the physical aspects of ﬁbroids was beyond their scope of practice . Although some referred patients to social workers for these types of support , this approach was not universal . This might also contribute to urban – rural disparities mentioned pre - viously due to inadequately staffed social workers in rural compared to urban clinics . These ﬁndings suggest the necessity for integrated health services to meet patients’ needs , which should be arranged within women’s health services . 32 Recent studies showed that a multidisciplinary health service combining gynecology and psychology signiﬁcantly impacted women’s mental health . 33 , 34 Therefore , it is crucial to implement integrated care as a standard practice in women’s health , which can be achieved by incorporating case managers in clinics to guide and support patients in accessing comprehensive re - sources 34 and / or implementing artiﬁcial intelligence to seamlessly bridge multiple specialists to treat multi - morbid patients ( e . g . , OB / GYN patient with psychiatric comorbidities ) . 35 Clinicians further endorsed the importance of hav - ing a well - established specialist network to streamline patient referrals . Patients could beneﬁt from the collab - oration of multidisciplinary specialists , such as OB / GYNs for choosing treatment , hematologists for addressing heavy bleeding , and surgeons . 36 , 37 The ab - sence of such a network could result in ﬁbroid frag - mented management and longer referral and consultation wait times , 38 , 39 potentially compromising patients’ outcome and satisfaction . Studies indicated that a ﬁbroid center with multidisciplinary specialists Laily , et al . ; Women’s Health Reports 2024 , 5 . 1 http : / / online . liebertpub . com / doi / 10 . 1089 / whr . 2023 . 0113 300 network could result in increased referral and shorter wait times 38 and satisfaction of patients for thorough consultations . 40 Our clinicians employed patient - centered approaches to tailor ﬁbroid care based on patients’ intrinsic values , concerns , and expectations . Like previous research , clini - cians guided patients in selecting treatment options by presenting all available choices , along with their beneﬁts and risks . 41 Individualized treatment plans were then de - veloped , considering patient - driven factors such as dis - ease severity , ﬁbroid location / size , treatment cost , side effects , and recovery , similar to what is reported in the existing literature . 7 , 18 However , in some cases , patients’ preferences were incompatible with their condition , leading to dissatisfaction despite additional counseling provided by clinicians . This highlights the importance of engaging patients in shared decision - making , ensur - ing that they are fully informed about the costs , beneﬁts , and risks of ﬁbroid treatment options ; even if patients’ original preferences may not always align with the ﬁnal decision . 42 Clinicians should aim to validate pa - tients’ choices to enhance satisfaction . 28 While treatment plans cater to individual patient needs , clinicians also aim to customize in - clinic patient education using handouts and online resources . Like other studies , our research participants advocated for integrating ﬁbroid education into routine gynecological visits and raising awareness about ﬁbroids as a public health initiative . 4 , 43 This is crucial due to the similarity of ﬁbroid symptoms with typical menstrual symp - toms , 44 and such education can aid in symptom recog - nition and promote early diagnosis . To achieve public awareness , distributing pamphlets in retail settings and conducting educational campaigns at high schools have been suggested . 19 In addition , to adapt to a rapidly changing scientiﬁc landscape , clinicians should receive continued education on ﬁbroids , 45 including information on new treatment modalities , especially minimally invasive treatments as clinicians noted that patients demanded shorter recov - ery time . Nonsurgical treatment options ( e . g . , uterine ar - tery embolization ) promisingly decreased recovery time , 46 while producing comparable success in terms of improving quality of life . 47 Therefore , by staying in - formed about these advancements through continued education , clinicians can effectively offer nonsurgical treatment options to their patients , leading to improved patient satisfaction and quality of life . Clinicians referenced that barriers to ﬁbroid care were exacerbated during the COVID - 19 pandemic , resulting in a shortage of clinicians and increased pa - tient hesitancy to seek treatment , consistent with recent gynecologic studies . 48 , 49 However , clinicians identiﬁed that the pandemic also brought about long - term solu - tions , such as the increased use of telehealth and the tendency to opt for nonsurgical treatment . The pan - demic led to a greater reliance on electronic services ( e . g . , telehealth ) to reach more previously inaccessible patients and forced clinicians to explore less invasive and immediate treatment options . 50 , 51 Research shows a growing trend of patients using complemen - tary and alternative medicine ( CAM ) to manage ﬁbroid symptoms , 52 – 54 suggesting that clinicians should be aware of CAM’s role in ﬁbroid management and con - sider it as a potential treatment option . Ultimately , the pandemic revealed the importance of clinicians’ resilience in providing quality health care in a contin - uously evolving world . This study is one of the ﬁrst to use qualitative method - ology to understand ﬁbroid health care delivery and identify areas for improvement from clinicians’ perspec - tives . However , there are some limitations . All partici - pants who expressed willingness to be interviewed were selected , introducing a potential selection bias . Although the study initially aimed for 20 participants , it had to conclude at 14 due to recruitment challenges , resulting in a smaller sample size . However , data saturation was still achieved . It is important to note a potential over - representation of academic clinicians , given that the re - cruitment used an academic - hospital network mailing list . The recruitment process was limited to Indiana cli - nicians in the central region , which may reduce the gen - eralizability of the ﬁndings to other regions . Qualitative research is prone to recall and social de - sirability biases , although efforts were made to mini - mize these biases , such as ensuring conﬁdentiality . Our somewhat homogenous sample ( predominantly non - Hispanic White , OB / GYN specialists , urban set - tings ) might limit the generalizability of ﬁndings to other populations and regions . Including a more di - verse range of clinicians , such as those from different specialties , ethnic backgrounds , and geographical areas , could enhance future studies’ applicability to a broader context . Our guide did not explicitly prompt individual clinicians to provide speciﬁc solutions for the identiﬁed issues , resulting in a lack of clinician rec - ommendations . Furthermore , COVID - 19 - related questions were added during data collection after the ﬁrst few interviews , limiting the comprehensive in - sights of all participants . Laily , et al . ; Women’s Health Reports 2024 , 5 . 1 http : / / online . liebertpub . com / doi / 10 . 1089 / whr . 2023 . 0113 301 Conclusions This study’s ﬁndings shed light on the challenges pa - tients face with ﬁbroids , as seen through the eyes of cli - nicians . The pandemic prompted both hurdles and progress in ﬁbroid health care . Drawing from their ex - tensive experience , clinicians pinpoint key areas for en - hancing ﬁbroid care , advocating for improved patient and clinician education , interdisciplinary teamwork , affordable insurance , and accessible care for all affected individuals . By addressing these needs , we can work to - ward practical solutions that signiﬁcantly improve the quality of life for women navigating the complexities of ﬁbroids . Practice implications Our study’s ﬁndings have signiﬁcant implications for en - hancing uterine ﬁbroid health care strategies . Clinicians noted a substantial lack of patient awareness , leading to misunderstandings and emotional distress , alongside prevalent misconceptions about ﬁbroid characteristics . Disparities in health care delivery , exacerbated by trans - portation issues and ﬁnancial constraints , highlighted the urgent need for addressing inequities . While clini - cians emphasized shared decision - making based on fac - tors like ﬁbroid severity , location , cost , and recovery time , there was a tendency to overlook the multidimen - sional aspects of ﬁbroid care , including social , emotional , and mental dimensions . The COVID - 19 pandemic prompted adaptations , such as the increased use of telehealth , revealing gaps in patient understanding and access . Moving forward , strategies for improvement should include comprehen - sive patient education , increased affordability of treat - ments , expanded insurance coverage , interdisciplinary collaboration , research on prevention , and the pursuit of minimally invasive options . These ﬁndings showcase the necessity for a paradigm shift in clinical standards , emphasizing a patient - centered , multidisciplinary , and adaptable approach to uterine ﬁbroid health care .
