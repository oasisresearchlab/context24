The problem of automatic musical genre detection has attracted large attention in the last decade , due to the emergence of digital music databases and Internet . Although a number of techniques has been applied to the problem , no general solution still exists , due to the imprecise features that properly deﬁne musical genre . This paper presents a preliminary attempt to apply Fuzzy Rule - Based System ( FRBS ) in cooperation with Evolutionary Algorithms to musical genre classiﬁcation . The novelty of the approach - which allows us to use fuzzy information extracted from audio ﬁles - is aligned with the fuzzy nature of the problem at hand , where no clear - cut rules are available for the classiﬁcation . Preliminary results presented allows to foresee the potential of the technique . I . I NTRODUCTION When dealers , radio station , or anybody interested in clas - sifying music contents has to characterize them or establish a basic classiﬁcation , musical genre is the ﬁrst and main categorical description employed . The proliferation of Internet based music stores and Electronic Music Distribution ( EMD ) systems , associated to huge music catalogues stored on dis - tributed databases , has increased the interest and importance of the classiﬁcation process . Obtaining relevant results after queries requires a correct association between genre and mu - sical pieces . Although manually labeling songs was the traditional method , it will no longer be possible : as reported by [ 1 ] , labeling hundred of thousand songs for Microsofts MSN Music Search Engine needed about 30 musicologists for one year . Therefore , automatic annotation processes are required , although no strict deﬁnition and boundaries are established for efﬁciently performing the classiﬁcation : cultural , historical and marketing factors traditionally inﬂuences the process . Yet , from the point of view of automatic information retrieval , several techniques and methodologies have already been tried , using information that can be analyzed from audio signals : instrumentation , rhythmic structure and pitch content of the music . These features can be used for similarity retrieval , classiﬁcation and audio thumbnailing [ 2 ] . Nevertheless , the relationship between these main features and the musical genre is not straight , and the presence of ambiguities doesn’t guarantee the correct automatic classiﬁcation . This paper presents a preliminary approach to musical genre classiﬁcation by means of a new perspective : Given the impre - cise nature of the features to be considered , a fuzzy approach is applied . Fuzzy Rule - Based System ( FRBS ) in cooperation with Genetic Algorithms ( GA ) allows us to perform musical genre classiﬁcation . The paper is organized in the following sections : Section II reviews related work ; Section III describes the techniques applied in this new approach ; Section IV shows the obtained results and their analysis ; and , ﬁnally , Section V concludes the paper with a discussion of the results . II . M USICAL G ENRE C LASSIFICATION The process of genre classiﬁcation usually involves two main steps : ( i ) feature extractions and ( ii ) classiﬁcation . The ﬁrst steps tries to extract from the audio signal information of interest , while the second one must include an algorithm capable of deciding music labels from the features extracted [ 3 ] . A number of different feature sets , usually based on some form of time - frequency representation , have been proposed to represent audio signals . Some of the pioneering works dealing with music signals tried to analyze isolated musi - cal instruments [ 4 ] , using pitch , amplitude , brightness , and bandwidth . Histograms of the relative frequencies of feature vectors have also been employed , as well as statistics based on Wavelet transform ( DWT ) coefﬁcients [ 5 ] . Nevertheless , the previously described analysis doesn’t consider the rhythmic structure of the music . Automatic beat detection has also been applied by other authors’ classiﬁcation [ 6 ] . However , only recently researchers have considered feature extraction and classiﬁcation as a means to classifying musical genre : Tzenatakis et al presented one of the ﬁrst attempts in 2002 [ 2 ] . Scaringella et al presented in 2005 a survey of the tech - niques that have been applied to the problem [ 7 ] , recognizing that no general agreement exists about the main features to be considered for the distinction about musical genre . A number of low - level features that can be useful are summarized : 2571 978 - 1 - 4244 - 7835 - 4 / 11 / $ 26 . 00 ©2011 IEEE ( i ) Timbre features - Temporal , energy , Spectral Shape and Perceptual features - as well as their ﬁrst and second - order transformations are employed by researchers , but no clue about which should be considered the main ones are provided ; ( ii ) Melody - Harmony , ( iii ) Rhythm ( iv ) semantically signiﬁcant features . Nevertheless , the variety of techniques and proposals keeps authors from deciding which should be considered the most relevant features to be employed . If we focus instead on the second part of the equation , the methods required for establishing a classiﬁcation once the features have been extracted from the audio signals , several approaches have very recently been applied to automatic musical genre classiﬁcation . An Expert System approach has been presented in [ 8 ] . Nevertheless the approach requires a manner to obtain reliable high - level descriptors from the audio signal . Moreover , expert systems are expensive to implement and to maintain . Attention has thus move to Machine Learning approaches . As described in [ 7 ] , a number of unsupervised and super - vised classiﬁcation methods relying in Gaussian methods for developing timbre models , or Hidden Markov Models ( HMMs ) to model the relationship between features over time has been proposed . Scaringella also reports in [ 7 ] the application of Support Vector Machines and Artiﬁcial Neural Networks in this context . While these approaches are relevant , researchers are sometimes not only interested in obtaining a classiﬁer system , but also information from the classiﬁer itself : ANNs usually behave like black boxes , and hardly ever provide information from inside . Only very recently , researchers have considered the use - fulness of Evolutionary Algorithms in the context of musical genre classiﬁcation . In [ 9 ] , for instance , authors use Genetic Algorithms to the problem of feature selection , working with different parts of music signal , in order to perform genre classiﬁcation . All of the above described works , have tried to ﬁght the information impreciseness required to establish correct genre classiﬁcation . Our approach faces the problem from a quite different perspective : instead of trying to make the information for the classiﬁcation as precise as possible - with a complex process of feature extraction , selection and ﬁltering - so that the technique employed can make the classiﬁcation as reliable as possible , we consider the opposite point of view . We think that techniques capable of coping with imprecise information are required here . Our approach make thus use of Fuzzy Logic - namely Fuzzy Rule - Based Systems ( FRBSs ) [ 10 ] in cooperation with Genetic Algorithms ( GAs ) when the tuning of some parameters are required . Fast Fourier Transform ( FFT ) is applied to the fragment of music to be analyzed , and the frequencies with higher energies - and their relationship - is the only input to the classiﬁcation system . We rely on the different harmony principles behind the musical genres considered in this preliminary work for the system to correctly work . To the best of our knowledge , this is the ﬁrst approach to exploit the intrinsically imprecise nature of the problem for performing a classiﬁcation by means of FRBSs and GAs . III . M ETHODOLOGY FRBSs has been successfully applied for solving classi - ﬁcation problems [ 10 ] – [ 12 ] . The main advantage of FRBSs is their capability of using impreciseness - Fuzzy information - to generate good classiﬁers systems . Moreover , recent works have shown that their capabilities can improve when they are combined with Genetic Algorithms for tuning the main Fuzzy Rules parameters [ 10 ] – [ 12 ] . In this paper we present a proposal to solve the problem of musical genre detection - and classiﬁcation - by means of FRBSs . Two genres will be considered : jazz and classic music . Our starting point will be a number of songs , that we sample : one second of music is randomly extracted and the frequency spectrum is computed by means of the FFT . Several samples can also be extracted from each song . Then , frequen - cies with higher energies are extracted and the relationship among them computed . We hope this information provides relevant information concerning the harmony that the song features , which could be useful to distinguish between musical genre . This will be the input information for FRBS that we want to develop . Even when the information provided is quite scarce and imprecise when compared with previous approaches , we hope the results will show the interest of the new method and their capability for coping the lack of precise information from the input . A . Initial FRBS A FRBS is composed by a Data Base deﬁnition ( DB ) , i . e . , the deﬁnitions of the Membership Functions ( MFs ) , and the inference engine parameters , the Rule Base ( RB ) [ 10 ] . In this subsection the initial FRBS ( 𝐹𝑅𝐵𝑆 𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡 ) developed in this work is described . To obtain the whole DB , we need to deﬁned the MFs and the RB . The ﬁrst step is to determine a set of interesting system variables by analyzing the set of examples . As stated before , we begin with a set of samples - one second long - obtained from classic and jazz audio ﬁles . We then apply the FFT to each of the fragments and the frequencies with higher energies are extracted - from ﬁrst to fourth - . We compute the relationship between those frequencies , giving rise to three numerical values that will act as input variables : the main input variables of the FRBS . The idea was to provide the system with information that might be useful when establishing harmony differences among styles . If the frequencies with higher energy values are described as F1 , F2 , F3 , F4 , where F1 is the highest value and F4 is the lowest one , the variables used by the FRBS are described as follows : 1 ) X1 : Relationship between F1 and F2 ( 𝐹 1 / 𝐹 2 ) . 2 ) X2 : Relationship between F1 and F3 ( 𝐹 1 / 𝐹 3 ) . 3 ) X3 : Relationship between F1 and F4 ( 𝐹 1 / 𝐹 4 ) . 4 ) Y : Output value ( where 1 is a classic music and 0 is a jazz music ) The next step is to obtain the MFs and the RB of the system . For this we use the Wang & Mendel method [ 13 ] . This method works as follows : 2572 1 ) Generate a set of linguistic rules candidates to solve the problem . It is necessary to look for the rule that best surrounds each sample data set . Thus , 𝑅𝐶 1 rule structure is obtained by assigning to each variable the best linguistic label associated with a fuzzy set that best matches with the corresponding component of the example 𝑒 1 , i . e . 𝑅𝐶 𝐼 = 𝐼𝑓 𝑋 1 𝑖𝑠 𝐴 𝐼 1 𝑎𝑛𝑑 . . . 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑋 𝑛 𝑖𝑠 𝐴 𝐼𝑛 𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑛 𝑌 𝑖𝑠 𝐵 𝐼 where 𝐴 𝐼𝑖 = 𝑎𝑟𝑔 𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝐴 ′ ∈ 𝐴 𝑖 ( 𝜇 𝐴 ′ ( 𝑥 𝐼𝑖 ) ) 𝐵 𝐼 = 𝑎𝑟𝑔 𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝐵 ′ ∈ 𝐵 ( 𝜇 𝐵 ′ ( 𝑦 𝐼 ) ) 2 ) Assign a degree of importance to each rule . This is obtained by calculating the envelope of the rule on the example as follows : 𝑉 𝐸 Π ( 𝑅𝐶 𝐼 , 𝑒 𝐼 ) = 𝜇 𝐴 𝐼 1 ( 𝑥 𝐼 1 ) ⋅ . . . ⋅ 𝜇 𝐴 𝐼𝑛 ( 𝑥 𝐼𝑛 ) ⋅ 𝜇 𝐵 𝐼 ( 𝑦 𝐼 ) 3 ) Get a ﬁnal RB from the set of linguistic rules candidates . To this end , the linguistic rules are grouped according to their background and in each group selects the rule with the greatest value of casing . Using this method we obtain a FRBS with 4 variables ( 3 inputs and 1 output ) , with 9 linguistic labels for each variable . The MFs are shown in Figure 1 and the RB is show in Table I . where the linguistic labels are the following ones : 1 ) ES : Extra small . 2 ) VS : Very small . 3 ) S : Small . 4 ) MS : Medium small . 5 ) M : Medium . 6 ) MH : Medium high . 7 ) H : High . 8 ) VH : Very high . 9 ) EH : Extra high . This labels have been selected following previous research using FRBS . Although they maybe not directly related to harmony principles , we want to simply check the usefulness of the approach . B . Genetic Tuning of the Proposed Fuzzy Rule - Based System Even though the approach described in the previous section has provided good results in classiﬁcation problems , we want to study whether 𝐹𝑅𝐵𝑆 𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡 could be further reﬁned for the problem at hand by performing a genetic tuning of the MFs ; i . e . , by means of a GA [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] , the MFs of the FRBS can be adjusted . This kind of hybridization between fuzzy logic [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] and GAs is well - known as Genetic Fuzzy Systems ( GFSs ) [ 10 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] . This section brieﬂy introduces the genetic tuning technique and the GA used to optimize the MF parameters of the initial FRBS presented in the previous section .

In order to do so , a tuning process considering the whole knowledge base ( KB ) obtained ( the preliminary DB and the derived RB ) is used a posteriori to adjust the MFs or the inference engine parameters . A graphical representation of the tuning process is shown in ﬁgure 2 . Genetic Tuning Definitive RB Evaluation Module RB Learning Process DB / Inference Engine Parameters Fig . 2 . Genetic tuning process . Among the different possibilities to perform tuning , one of the most widely - used approaches to enhance the performance of FRBSs is the one focused on the DB deﬁnition , usually named tuning of MFs , or DB tuning [ 20 ] – [ 27 ] . In [ 23 ] , we can ﬁnd a ﬁrst and classic proposal on the tuning of MFs . 2573 0 1 1 . 001 2 . 849 4 . 698 6 . 547 8 . 396 10 . 24 12 . 09 13 . 94 15 . 79 X1 : F1 / F2 ES VS S MS M MH H VH EH 0 1 1 3 . 96 6 . 93 9 . 89 12 . 86 15 . 83 18 . 79 21 . 76 24 . 72 X2 : F1 / F3 ES VS S MS M MH H VH EH 0 1 1 6 . 28 11 . 57 16 . 85 22 . 14 27 . 42 32 . 7 37 . 99 43 . 27 X3 : F1 / F4 ES VS S MS M MH H VH EH 0 1 0 0 . 125 0 . 25 0 . 375 0 . 5 0 . 625 0 . 75 0 . 875 1 Y ES VS S MS M MH H VH EH Fig . 1 . MFs In this case , the tuning methods reﬁne the parameters that identify the MFs associated to the labels comprising the DB . Classically , due the wide use of the triangular - shaped MFs , the tuning methods [ 10 ] , [ 23 ] – [ 25 ] , [ 27 ] reﬁne the three deﬁnition parameters that identify these kinds of MFs ( see Figure 3 ) . T T ' a a ' b ' b c ' c Fig . 3 . Tuning by changing the basic MF parameters . In this paper , we perform a DB tuning to reﬁne the three deﬁnition parameters that identify the triangular - shaped MFs in order to improve the 𝐹𝑅𝐵𝑆 𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡 performance . In the next subsection , the evolutionary algorithm used to perform the genetic tuning and to improve the 𝐹𝑅𝐵𝑆 𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡 , obtaining the FRBS known as 𝐹𝑅𝐵𝑆 𝑡𝑢𝑛𝑒𝑑 , is described . 2 ) Evolutionary Algorithm : To perform the genetic tuning we consider a GA that presents a real coding scheme and uses the stochastic universal sampling as selection procedure together with an elitist scheme . The operators employed for performing the individual recombination and mutation are uniform mutation and the max - min - arithmetical crossover [ 24 ] . The remaining parameters are the following ones : ∙ Generations = 1200 ∙ Population size = 61 ∙ Crossover probability = 0 . 6 ∙ Mutation probability = 0 . 1 In the following , the components needed to design this process are explained . Chromosome Evaluation : For each input example , the 𝐹𝑅𝐵𝑆 𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡 generates an output value into interval [ 0 , 1 ] . If this value is higher than a threshold value ( 𝐿 ) the example will be classiﬁed as a classic music ; otherwise , it will be classiﬁed as a jazz music . Thus , every input example can be considered as : ∙ Classic Success ( CS ) : If the example is labelled as a classic music and it is a classic music . ∙ Classic Failure ( CF ) : If the example is labelled as a classic music and it is a jazz music . ∙ Jazz Success ( JS ) : If the example is labelled as a jazz music and it is a jazz music . ∙ Jazz Failure ( JF ) : If the example is labelled as a jazz music and it is a classic music . The objective of this algorithm is to minimize the number of CFs and JFs obtained by the 𝐹𝑅𝐵𝑆 𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡 . To evaluate a determined chromosome 𝐶 𝑗 we use the following ﬁtness function : 𝐹𝑖𝑡𝑛𝑒𝑠𝑠 ( 𝐶 𝑗 ) = ∣ 𝐶𝐹 ∣ ∣ 𝐷 ∣ + ∣ 𝐽𝐹 ∣ ∣ 𝐷 ∣ ( 1 ) where ∣ 𝐶𝐹 ∣ is the number of CFs obtained , ∣ 𝐽𝐹 ∣ is the number of JFs obtained and ∣ 𝐷 ∣ is the dataset size . The fuzzy inference system uses the center of gravity weighted by the matching strategy as a defuzziﬁcation oper - ator and the minimum t - norm as implication and conjunctive operators . Coding Scheme and Initial Gene Pool : A real coding scheme is considered . Each chromosome is a vector of real numbers with size 3 ⋅ 𝐹 + 1 ( 𝐹 being the number of MFs in 2574 the given DB ) in which the three parameters that identify each MFs and the threshold value are coded . Then , a chromosome 𝐶 𝑗 has the following form , being 𝑚 𝑖 the number of MFs of each of the 𝑛 variables in the DB : 𝐶 𝑗 = 𝐶 𝑗 1 𝐶 𝑗 2 ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ 𝐶 𝑗𝑛 𝐿 𝑗 , 𝐶 𝑗𝑖 = ( 𝑎 𝑖𝑗 1 , 𝑏 𝑖𝑗 1 , 𝑐 𝑖𝑗 1 , . . . , 𝑎 𝑖𝑗𝑚 𝑖 , 𝑏 𝑖𝑗𝑚 𝑖 , 𝑐 𝑖𝑗𝑚 𝑖 ) , 𝑖 = 1 , ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ , 𝑛 The initial gene pool is created making use of the initial DB deﬁnition of the 𝐹𝑅𝐵𝑆 𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡 . This initial DB with 0 . 5 as threshold value is encoded directly into a chromosome , denoted as 𝐶 1 . The remaining individuals are generated at random in the variation intervals associated to each MF and to the threshold value . For each 𝑀𝐹 𝑓 = ( 𝑎 𝑓 , 𝑏 𝑓 , 𝑐 𝑓 ) where 𝑓 = ( 1 , . . . , 𝐹 ) , the variation intervals are calculated in the following way ( See Figure 4 ) : [ 𝐼 𝑙𝑎 𝑓 , 𝐼 𝑟𝑎 𝑓 ] = [ 𝑎 𝑓 − ( 𝑏 𝑓 − 𝑎 𝑓 ) / 2 , 𝑎 𝑓 + ( 𝑏 𝑓 − 𝑎 𝑓 ) / 2 ] [ 𝐼 𝑙𝑏 𝑓 , 𝐼 𝑟𝑏 𝑓 ] = [ 𝑏 𝑓 − ( 𝑏 𝑓 − 𝑎 𝑓 ) / 2 , 𝑏 𝑓 + ( 𝑐 𝑓 − 𝑏 𝑓 ) / 2 ] [ 𝐼 𝑙𝑐 𝑓 , 𝐼 𝑟𝑐 𝑓 ] = [ 𝑐 𝑓 − ( 𝑐 𝑓 − 𝑏 𝑓 ) / 2 , 𝑐 𝑓 + ( 𝑐 𝑓 − 𝑏 𝑓 ) / 2 ] ( 2 ) Fig . 4 . The variation intervals . The variation interval for the threshold value 𝐿 is [ 0 , 1 ] . Therefore , we create a population of chromosomes containing 𝐶 1 as its ﬁrst individual and the remaining ones initiated randomly , with each gene being in its respective variation interval . Max - min - arithmetical crossover : If 𝐶 𝑣 = ( 𝑎 1 𝑣 1 , . . . , 𝑒 𝑣𝑘 , . . . , 𝐿 𝑣 ) and 𝐶 𝑤 = ( 𝑎 1 𝑤 1 , . . . , 𝑒 𝑤𝑘 , . . . , 𝐿 𝑤 ) are to be crossed , the following four offspring are generated 𝐶 1 = 𝑑𝐶 𝑤 + ( 1 − 𝑑 ) 𝐶 𝑣 𝐶 2 = 𝑑𝐶 𝑣 + ( 1 − 𝑑 ) 𝐶 𝑤 𝐶 3 with 𝑒 3 𝑘 = min { 𝑒 𝑣𝑘 , 𝑒 𝑤𝑘 } 𝐶 4 with 𝑒 4 𝑘 = max { 𝑒 𝑣𝑘 , 𝑒 𝑤𝑘 } ( 3 ) This operator can use a parameter 𝑑 which is either a constant , or a variable whose value depends on the age of the population . The resulting descendants are the two best of the four aforesaid offspring . We have employd a value of 0 . 35 for the parameter 𝑑 in our experiments . Uniform mutation : If 𝐶 𝑗 = ( 𝑎 1 𝑗 1 , . . . , 𝑒 𝑗𝑘 , . . . , 𝐿 𝑗 ) is a chromosome and the element 𝑒 𝑗𝑘 was selected for this mu - tation ( the domain of 𝑒 𝑗𝑘 is [ 𝑒 𝑙𝑗𝑘 , 𝑒 𝑟𝑗𝑘 ] ) , the result is a vector 𝐶 ′ 𝑗 = ( 𝑎 1 𝑗 1 , . . . , 𝑒 ′ 𝑗𝑘 , . . . , 𝐿 𝑗 ) and 𝑒 ′ 𝑗𝑘 = 𝑒 𝑗𝑘 + ( 𝑒 𝑟𝑗𝑘 − 𝑒 𝑗𝑘 ) ⋅ 𝑟 , ( 4 ) where 𝑟 is a random number into the interval [ − 1 . 0 , 1 . 0 ] . IV . E XPERIMENTS AND R ESULTS The experiments have been conducted using 200 samples - 100 jazz and 100 classic - obtained from the personal archive of researchers : music by Charly Parker - the famous saxo player jazz musician - and classic music by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart . Once the input variables were generated by means of FFT , the process of deﬁning and tuning the FRBS was performed using a PC , Intel processor - dual core 1 . 7 GHz - and 2 Gb of RAM . The process took 4 minutes . Once the 𝐹𝑅𝐵𝑆 𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑛𝑡 has been tuned by the genetic algorithm , the new 𝐹𝑅𝐵𝑆 𝑡𝑢𝑛𝑒𝑑 ob - tains the MFs tuned shown in Figure 5 . The ﬁnal classiﬁcation results provided by both system are included in Table II . TABLE II R ESULTS 𝐹𝑅𝐵𝑆 𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡 𝐹𝑅𝐵𝑆 𝑡𝑢𝑛𝑒𝑑 Classic Success 28 % 90 % Classic Failure 72 % 10 % Jazz Success 96 % 76 % Jazz Failure 4 % 24 % General Success 62 % 83 % General Failure 38 % 17 % Some conclusions can be drawn : Firstly , it seems that FRBS can more easily classify Classic than Jazz Music , at least with the information provided as input ( higher energy frequencies relationship ) and the samples employed for the testing procedure . Second , as expected , the GA - tunned system signiﬁcantly improves the quality of results , that reaches 83 % general success rate . The results are impressive when compared with previous research if we take into account the information provided . Nevertheless , the presented results are a preliminary attempt : more samples , music genres and validation techniques will be applied to certify the usefulness of Genetic - Fuzzy Systems for Music Genre Classiﬁcation . V . C ONCLUSION This paper has presented a preliminary approach to Musical Genre Classiﬁcation by means of Fuzzy Rule - Based Systems adjusted by means of Genetic Algorithms . To the best of our knowledge this is the ﬁrst attempt to employ Fuzzy Rules for addressing this problem . Two different musical genres has been considered , Jazz and Classic music , and 200 samples have been successfully classiﬁed .

Although the number of genres and samples have been kept reduced for this ﬁrst attempt of using FRBSs , the impressive results obtained allow us to be optimistic for the future of the technique . We hope to continue the research including a larger number of genres as well as an increased number of audio ﬁles and samples , extracted from available databases . We hope to obtain a general FRBSs based classiﬁcation system competitive with previously described one , or even better when provided with input information traditionally employed by previous approaches .
