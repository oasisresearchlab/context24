We analyzed the effects of ER - associated processes and factors on infection and on isolated viruses and found that SV40 makes use of the thiol - disulﬁde oxidoreduc - tases , ERp57 and PDI , as well as the retrotrans - location proteins Derlin - 1 and Sel1L . ERp57 isomerizes speciﬁc interchain disulﬁdes con - necting the major capsid protein , VP1 , to a crosslinked network of neighbors , thus uncou - pling about 12 of 72 VP1 pentamers . Cryo - elec - tron tomography indicated that loss of inter - chain disulﬁdes coupled with calcium depletion induces selective dissociation of the 12 vertex pentamers , a step likely to mimic uncoating of the virus in the cytosol . Thus , the virus utilizes the protein folding machinery for initial uncoat - ing before exploiting the ER - associated degra - dation machinery presumably to escape from the ER lumen into the cytosol . INTRODUCTION During entry into host cells , animal viruses typically un - dergo a process of stepwise destabilization and uncoating according to a program that is linked in time and space with the movement of the particle from compartment to compartment in the cell ( Marsh and Helenius , 2006 ) . In this study , we have analyzed the uncoating and pen - etration of Simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) , a simple , nonenveloped DNA virus of the polyoma virus family . It uses the ganglio - side GM1 as receptor , and enters host cells by activating the caveolar / lipid raft pathway of endocytosis ( Damm et al . , 2005 ; Pelkmans et al . , 2001 ; Tsai et al . , 2003 ) . After internalization , the ﬁrst station is the caveosome , a pH - neutral , caveolin - containing endocytic organelle distinct from classical endosomes . From the caveosome , the virus moves in noncaveolar vesicles along microtubules to the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) ( Kartenbeck et al . , 1989 ; Pelk - mans et al . , 2001 ) . After translocation from the ER into the cytosol , the virus is thought to enter the nucleus via nu - clear pore complexes where transcription and replication take place ( Clever et al . , 1991 ; Estes et al . , 1971 ; Nakanishi et al . , 1996 ) . SV40 and related polyoma virusesare unusual in several respects . First , their DNA genome is associated with his - tonesinacircular complex containing20 – 22nucleosomes ( Varshavsky et al . , 1977 ) . Second , the 50 nm capsids are composed of homopentamers of the major capsid protein , VP1 ( 43 kDa ) associated with one of the minor structural proteins VP2 or VP3 . Thevirus has icosahedral ( T = 7 ) sym - metry , andcontains72pentamersofwhich12areﬁve - and 60 six - coordinated ( Liddington et al . , 1991 ) . The pentam - ers are connected to each other via C - terminal peptides extendingfromaVP1moleculeinonepentamertodocking sites present in two VP1 molecules of a neighboring pen - tamer stabilized by calcium ions ( Ca 2 + ) ( Li et al . , 2003 ) . The pentamers are linked to each other by disulﬁde bonds between cysteine 104 ( C104 ) residues ( Liddington et al . , 1991 ) . The aim of our study was to determine why SV40 uses such an unusual and elaborate entry pathway and to deﬁne possible roles for the ER in the entry process . We found that isomerization of interpentamer disulﬁde bonds in the virus particle plays a central role in the uncoating process . To initiate disassembly , the virus takes advan - tage of the protein folding and quality control machinery present in the ER , before exploiting components of the ER - associated degradation ( ERAD ) presumably to escape from the ER lumen to the cytosol . 516 Cell 131 , 516 – 529 , November 2 , 2007 ª 2007 Elsevier Inc . RESULTS ER Processes Associated with SV40 Entry We ﬁrst perturbed ER - associated processes in CV - 1 cells and determined 20 hr postinfection ( p . i . ) whether infection was affected using a FACS assay based on T - antigen ex - pression . Inhibitors of proteasomal degradation ( MG - 132 , omuralide ) , ER Ca 2 + homeostasis ( thapsigargin ) , and di - sulﬁde bond formation ( DTT ) blocked infection ( Figure 1A ) . When added 8 hr p . i . , they failed to affect infection or had only partial effects , suggesting that inhibition mainly in - volved early events ( Figure 1B ) . Addition of DTT at various times after virus addition showed that the step affected occurred between 4 and 8 hr p . i . with a midpoint at 5 . 5 hr p . i . ( Figure 1C ) . This correlated with the arrival of SV40 in the ER ( Kartenbeck et al . , 1989 ) . Inhibition of trimming of N - linked core glycans by kifunensine ( ER mannosidase inhibitor ) and castanospermine ( glucosidase inhibitor ) , or inhibition of GRP94 and other members of the heat shock protein 90 chaperones had little effect ( Figure 1A ) . Next , siRNA - mediated knockdown of ER proteins was performed in HeLa cells . We conﬁrmed by immunoblotting that the level of target protein was reduced ( Figures S1A – S1F in the Supplemental Data available with this article online ) . While no effect was observed on VSV infectivity ( a virus that does not enter via the ER route , Figure S1H ) , depletion of two ER thiol - disulﬁde oxidoreductases , pro - tein disulﬁde isomerase ( PDI ) and ERp57 , signiﬁcantly reduced SV40 infection ( Figure 1D ) . In contrast , depletion of the oxidoreductase TMX3 or ERp29 ( an ER protein with thioredoxin - like fold but lacking the catalytic site ) , and the two glycoprotein chaperones , calnexin ( CNX ) and calreti - culin ( CRT ) , had no effect ( Figure 1D ) . Silencing of ERp72 , another abundant ER thiol - disulﬁde oxidoreductase , gave divergent results for two independent siRNAs that both reduced ERp72 levels ; one enhanced infection , and the other had no effect ( Figure 1D ) . Signiﬁcantinhibition ofinfection wasalso observed after silencing of Derlin - 1 and Sel1L ( sel - 1 suppressor of lin - like protein , Figure 1D ) , two transmembrane proteins involved in the export of misfolded proteins from the ER to the cytosol for proteasomal degradation ( Mueller et al . , 2006 ; Ye et al . , 2004 ) . The results implied that ER factors involved in disulﬁde bond oxidation , reduction , and isomerization were critical for productive entry . In addition , calcium homeostasis and ER - associated degradation ( ERAD ) seemed to play a role . Free Sulfhydryl Groups and Disulﬁde Bonds in Intact Virions To pursue the oxidoreductases , we ﬁrst analyzed whether disulﬁdes and free cysteines in the virus were important for infectivity . We found that treatment of isolated virus with 5 mM DTT resulted in full reduction of all disulﬁde bonds in the particle ( see below ) but did not affect infectiv - ity ( Figure 2A ) and neither did treatment with the thiol oxi - dant , diamide . However , alkylation using 4 - acetamido - 4 0 - maleimidylstilbene - 2 , 2 0 - disulfonicacid ( AMS ) , oriodoacetic acid ( IAA ) , reduced infectivity by 70 % – 80 % , suggesting that one or more free sulfhydryl groups were critical ( Fig - ure 2A ) . Alkylation or reduction of viruses did not affect internalization or transport to the ER , as shown by the Figure 1 . ER Processes and ER Proteins Are Associated with SV40 Infection CV - 1 ( A – C ) or HeLa ( D ) cells were infected with SV40 ( one plaque - forming unit ( PFU ) / cell ) . The data represent the average ± SD of three inde - pendent experiments . ( A ) Pharmacological inhibitors were added 30 min prior to addition of virus and present duringinfection ( 100 m Mkifunensine , 5 m Mcas - tanospermine , 20 m MMG - 132 , 5 m Momuralide , 2 m M geldanamycin , 1 m M thapsigargin , and 5 mM DTT ) . ( B ) As in ( A ) . Inhibitors were present either throughout infection ( black ) , or added at 8 hr p . i . ( white ) . ( C ) 5 mM DTT was added at given times post - addition of SV40 ( solid line ) . Alternatively , cells were infected in the presence of 5 m M nocoda - zole ( noc ) . At 2 hr p . i , noc was washed out , and 5mMDTTwasadded ( dashedline ) . DTTinhibi - tion was similar with or without noc , a microtu - bule - dissociating agent that allows virus uptake into caveosomes but prevents further transport to the ER ( Pelkmans et al . , 2001 ) , and thus conﬁrmed that the DTT sensitive step occurred after exit from the caveosome . ( D ) siRNA silencing was achieved by transfec - tion of siRNAs ( Figure S1 ) . A margin for insig - niﬁcant pertubations of infection ( ± 20 % ) was indicated by dashed lines .

VP1 is the only protein in SV40 that has cysteines . The X - ray structure shows that four of the seven cysteines ( C87 , C207 , C254 , and C267 ) are reduced and hidden within the folded protein or in the interphase between the subunits ( Figures S2A and S2B ) . C49 is also reduced but partially exposed on the pentamer surface ( Figure S2B , arrowhead ) . C104residuesforminterchaindisulﬁdebonds witheachotherlinkingVP1subunitsinadjacentpentamers ( Liddington et al . , 1991 ; Stehle et al . , 1996 ) . Around the 12 pentamers located at the vertex of the icosahedral capsid , the situation is special because here the C104 from a VP1 in a ﬁve - coordinated pentamer is in close proximity to two C104 residues from VP1 in two adjacent six - coordinated pentamers ( Figure S2C ) . The three cysteines form one disulﬁde while one C104 is reduced . The seventh cysteine , C9 , is part of a 13 - residue , N - terminal peptide that is not visible in the X - ray structure but thought to be hidden below the pentamers ( Liddington et al . , 1991 ) . The inac - cessibility of C9 to mercury labeling suggests that it may be disulﬁde bonded ( Liddington et al . , 1991 ) . To determine how many cysteines in VP1 of intact vi - ruses were alkylated , we used a gel - shift assay based on the 5 kDa increase in the molecular weight of a protein for each cysteine alkylated by polyethylene glycol maleimide ( malPEG ) . The observed shift indicated that only one free cysteine was accessible for alkylation , and this only in a fraction of VP1 molecules ( Figure 3A , lane 2 ) . To identify the accessible cysteine ( s ) , we treated the virus with dif - ferent alkylating agents adding distinguishable masses as outlined in Figure 3B . Subsequent mass spectrometry showed that some C104 and C49 were alkylated indicat - ing that they were reduced and accessible in the intact virus particle ( Figures 3B – 3D and S3B and S3C ) . After DTT treatment of the virus , additional cysteines became accessible for alkylation . In addition to C104 , C9 was now also alkylated indicating that in the intact virus it must be oxidized ( Figures 3B – 3D and S3B and S3C ) . Since C104 was exclusively paired with C104 and all other cysteines were reduced in the intact virus , we concluded that C9 was present in C9 - C9 disulﬁdes . When the virus was analyzed by nonreducing SDS - PAGE after treatment with iodoacetamide ( IAM ) before and during exposure to SDS to alkylate free sulfhydryl groups in VP1 , the majority of VP1 hardly entered the gel ( Figure 3E , lane 3 , arrow ) . We concluded that in intact viruses , theVP1proteinswereextensivelycrosslinkedwith each other through a network of C104 - C104 and C9 - C9 disulﬁde bonds . Thiswasconﬁrmedusing sucrosevelocity Figure 2 . Free Sulfhydryls in SV40 Are Critical during Entry CV - 1cellswereinfectedwithSV40 ( 1PFU / cell [ A ] ; 10PFU / cell [ B ] ) .

After confocal image aquisition , the amountofcolocalizationofSV40 ( green ) withcellularmarkers ( red ) was quantiﬁed and normalized to SV40 in the absence of DTT . 518 Cell 131 , 516 – 529 , November 2 , 2007 ª 2007 Elsevier Inc . gradient centrifugation of alkylated and SDS - solubilized virus . The SDS - denatured viruses sedimented homoge - neously as 125S particles ( Figure 3F ) . Only a minor fraction of VP1 dissociated from these denatured particles , and was found on top of the gradient . To form such an exten - sive disulﬁde network , we surmised the C104 - C104 disul - ﬁdes connected adjacent pentamers as shown by the X - ray structure , whereas the C9 - C9 disulﬁdes were likely to occur both between pentamers and within pentamers . The presence of C9 - C9 and C104 - C104 disulﬁdes was conﬁrmed by analyzing SV40 mutants in which cysteines C9 and C104 had been replaced with alanine ( Ishii et al . , 1994 ) . Analysis by nonreducing SDS - PAGE showed that C9A or C104A mutants contained VP1 dimers and monomers , whileC49AmutantsexhibitedcrosslinkedVP1 oligomers exactly as the wild - type ( Figure 3G , lanes 1 – 4 ) . The double mutant C9A / C104A was devoid of disulﬁde crosslinked species and contained only monomers ( Fig - ure 3G , lane 5 ) . This conﬁrmed our conclusion that C9 - C9 and C104 - C104 disulﬁde bonds provide the crosslinks between VP1 molecules in the particle . Loss of Interchain Disulﬁde Bonds during SV40 Entry Whilethenetworkofinterchaindisulﬁdebondscontributes to the stability of extracellular virus particles , elimination of some of the bonds is probably necessary for uncoating and release of the genome during virus entry . To determine whether interchain disulﬁde bonds were actually lost during infection , alkylated and nonalkylated virus particles were allowed to enter cells for different time periods up to 10 hr . The fraction of VP1 no longer cross - linked to the network of disulﬁdes was determined by alkylating the cell lysates , treating them with SDS , and subjecting them to nonreducing SDS - PAGE . Immunoblot - ting showed that while the majority of interchain disulﬁde bonds in incoming viruses remained intact , a fraction of VP1 molecules was released from the disulﬁde bonded network showing up as monomers in the SDS - gel . The amount of VP1 released by SDS remained at values below 2 % until 6 hr p . i . , when it increased to about 20 % ( Fig - ure 4A ) . The time course of disconnection coincided with virus arrival in the ER . Interestingly , the alkylated viruses did not show release of monomeric VP1 during infection , suggesting that free sulfhydryl groups were needed to release VP1 molecules from the disulﬁde crosslinked network , a requirement con - sistent with a mechanism based on disulﬁde isomerization rather than disulﬁde reduction . Since the alkylated virus was non infectious , the result also implied that the loss of interchain disulﬁdes was an essential part of the pro - ductive entry pathway . Depletion of ERp57 by siRNA blocked the generation of decrosslinked VP1 in HeLa cells ( Figure 4B ) . When PDI was similarly depleted , no effect was observed . This indi - cated that it was ERp57 that catalyzed the loss of inter - chain disulﬁdes . That this occurred by disulﬁde isomeriza - tion rather than reduction was shown by the slightly faster migration of the released VP1 compared to the DTT reduced form of the same protein ( Figure 4A , lanes 6 – 9 ) . Such differences in mobility indicate presence of intra - chain disulﬁdes . Since the X - ray structure of VP1 shows no intrachain disulﬁdes in the intact virus , one or more in - terchain disulﬁde bond ( s ) must have been converted by ERp57 to intrachain disulﬁdes by isomerization . Analysis of SV40 cysteine mutants provided additional insight into the role of disulﬁde bonds and ERp57 . Al - though formation of these mutant viruses ( particularly of the C104A mutant ) was slower and less efﬁcient than wild - type SV40 , we could conﬁrm that they all were infec - tious . As expected , siRNA - mediated depletion of ERp57 reduced infection of the C49A mutant as much as of wild - type SV40 ( Figure 4C ) . However , ERp57 depletion did not affect infectivity of the C9A / C104A mutant , a virus lacking disulﬁde crosslinks between pentamers ( Fig - ure 4C ) . This conﬁrmed that the role of ERp57 is , indeed , linked to the elimination of C9 - C9 and / or C104 - C104 inter - chain disulﬁde bonds . If such disulﬁdes are lacking as in the C9A / C104A double mutant , ERp57 is dispensable . It is noteworthy in this context , that the C9A / C104A mu - tant—like the C49A mutant and the wild - type virus—was sensitive to DTT ( Figure 4D ) . This indicated that the inhib - itory effect of DTT was not due to reduction of viral disul - ﬁdes , but rather to an effect on cellular factors . ERp57 and PDI Modify SV40 Disulﬁdes In Vitro Incubation of isolated virus in cytosolic extracts or in a buf - fer mimicking the reducing and Ca 2 + - free environment of the cytosol failed to induce loss of interchain disulﬁdes in SV40 ( Figure 5A , lanes 4 and 5 , and Figure 5B ) . The same wasfoundwhentheviruswasincubatedinabuffermimick - ing the oxidizing conditions of the ER ( Figure 5A , lane 5 ) . However , when either isolated PDI or ERp57 were added to the redox buffer , signiﬁcant loss of interchain disulﬁdes was observed using the SDS - PAGE assay ( Fig - ures 5D and 5E , lanes 3 – 6 ) . Again , about 20 % of the VP1 proteins were found to be uncoupled from the capsids us - ing either of the oxidoreductases . When the two enzymes were inactivated by alkylation , no release of VP1 occurred indicating a direct role for the thiol - disulﬁde oxidoreduc - tase function ( Figures 5D and 5E , lane 7 ) . The full effect was reached with one oxidoreductase molecule per ten viruses indicating a catalytic effect . Incubation with both oxidoreductases together did not increase the amount of monomeric VP1 ( Figure 5F , lane 4 ) . To investigate whether ERp57 and PDI served as reduc - tases or isomerases in vitro , alkylated SV40 was used as a substrate . PDI was found to release a similar amount of reducedVP1asfromcontrolvirus ( Figure5E , lane8 ) . ERp57 failed to release any VP1 ( Figure 5D , lane 8 ) . Hence , ERp57 seemedtoactasanisomerase , PDIasareductase . Wealso investigated whether Ca 2 + chelation would increase the ef - ﬁciency of VP1 release . Only PDI showed such an increase ( Figures 5D and 5E , lane 9 ) , suggesting that PDI acts most efﬁciently on disulﬁdes when the SV40 particle has under - gone a structural change induced by the loss of Ca 2 + ions , Cell 131 , 516 – 529 , November 2 , 2007 ª 2007 Elsevier Inc . 519 Figure 3 .

( B ) Outline for the identiﬁcation of the individual SV40 cysteines present as free sulfhydryls or disulﬁde bonded by mass spectrometry . Strategy 1 labeled reduced and exposed cysteines differently than all other cysteines by alkylation with IAM of intact SV40 . All further cysteines were alkylated 520 Cell 131 , 516 – 529 , November 2 , 2007 ª 2007 Elsevier Inc . e . g . , through the externalization of the C - terminal arm of VP1 , which is normally held in place by the cation . The monomeric VP1 generated in vitro after ERp57 and ERp57 / PDI incubation migrated identically to VP1 re - leased during infection in vivo ( Figure 5F , compare lanes 1 , 3 , and 4 ) . In contrast , the band generated by PDI alone migrated like the completely reduced species ( Figure 5F , lanes 2 and 5 ) . This was consistent with a disulﬁde isom - erization from interchain to intrachain disulﬁdes in VP1 by ERp57 , but not by PDI . The results showed that ERp57 eliminates interpenta - meric disulﬁde bonds in SV40 . As during cell entry , ERp57 catalyzes in vitro the disconnection of about 20 % of pen - tamers by disulﬁde isomerization . In contrast , PDI induces reduction of disulﬁdes in vitro , a reaction that does not occur during virus entry . Release of Five - Coordinated Pentamers Judging by the mobility of VP1 in SDS gels , the stabilizing network of disulﬁde crosslinks was eliminated by treat - ment with DTT ( Figure 3A , lane 2 ) . This did not cause dis - sociation of the particle . Velocity centrifugation of reduced virus showed only a shift in the sedimentation coefﬁcient from 250S for control virus to 245S ( Figure 6A ) . A similar shift was seen when the virus was treated with the Ca 2 + - chelating agent EGTA to remove the VP1 - bound Ca 2 + ions , and thus weakened the interpentamer connec - tions provided by the invading C - terminal arms . Negative stain electron microscopy indicated that when applied alone , bothofthesetreatmentsinducedpenetrationofstain into the capsids , consistent with loosening pentamer con - tacts , but the particles remained intact ( Figure 6B , b and c ) . However as previously reported ( Hartmann and Scott , 1981 ) , a major structural change occurred when DTT and EGTA were added together . EM showed release of doughnut - shaped particles with a diameter of 12 nm corresponding most likely to VP1 pentamers ( Figure 6B , d and e ) . However , amorphous capsid structures were still present with visible capsomers ( Figure 6B , d ) . Sucrose velocity gradient sedimentation analysis showed that combined DTT - reduction and Ca 2 + chelation resulted in two peaks of VP1 corresponding to pentamers at the top of the gradient and modiﬁed capsids that sedi - mented at 230S ( Figure 6A ) . The 230S particles contained the viral DNA but only about half of the VP1 and VP2 / VP3 proteins ( Figures 6C and 6D ) . Partial uncoating of the virus could thus be induced in vitro by combined reduction of interchain disulﬁde bonds and extraction of the VP1 asso - ciated Ca 2 + ions . When the partially uncoated viruses were viewed by cryo - electron microscopy with tomographic reconstruc - tion , the particles had lost the capsomers located at the vertices but retained all six - coordinated capsomers ( Fig - ures 6F and S4 ) . This suggested that the 12 ﬁve - coordi - natedpentamerswerelesstightlyassociatedthantherest , and dissociated selectively when the interchain disulﬁdes and the associations provided by C - terminal peptides were lost . Interestingly , when SV40 capsids devoid of DNA ( ‘‘empty particles’’ ) were subjected to the same disassem - bly conditions , no remnant capsids were observed . The entire capsid dissociated into slowly sedimenting pentam - ers ( Figure6E ) . It isthus possiblethat theviralminichromo - some , located in the central cavity , interacts with pentam - ers and increases the stability of the particle . While no obvious structural alterations of SV40 particles incubated in vitro with ERp57 and / or PDI could be ob - served by EM after negative staining , sucrose velocity gra - dient centrifugation showed the release of 9 % of pentam - ers after Ca 2 + chelation ( Figure 6G ) . This indicated that both reduction and isomerization of disulﬁdes in vitro can lead to pentamer release . For pentamer dissociation how - ever , the loss of disulﬁde bonds is not sufﬁcient ; loss of Ca 2 + ions is also required . Pertubation of ERAD Affects Infection ThenotionthatSV40entryinvolvestheERADpathwaywas suggested by the sensitivity of infection to proteasome in - hibitors and to the silencing of Derlin - 1 and Sel1L , two pro - teins involved in retrotranslocation ( Figures 1A and 1D ) ( Mueller et al . , 2006 ; Ye et al . , 2004 ) . The dependence on PDI for infection ( Figure 1D ) also indirectly supported such a connection because Forster et al . ( 2006 ) reported that PDI depletion causes ER retention of misfolded pro - tein substrates . In contrast , depletion of ERp72 , another abundant PDI - like protein in the ER , increases retrotrans - location of misfolded proteins ( Forster et al . , 2006 ) . by MMTS , after DTT reduction and SDS - denaturation .

Control virus represents average of multiple 524 Cell 131 , 516 – 529 , November 2 , 2007 ª 2007 Elsevier Inc . To pursue the issue further , we tested whether the cys - teine mutants C49A and C9A / C104A were also dependent on these factors . Infectivity of mutant and wild - type SV40 wassimilarlysensitivetoproteasomeinhibitors , andtoPDI and Derlin - 1 depletion ( Figures 7A and 7B ) . The sensitivity of the C9A / C104A mutant showed that the step affected by these perturbations was independent of the ERp57 - mediated disulﬁde isomerization step . To conﬁrm that retrotranslocation was affected by these perturbations , we measured the level of polyubiquitinated proteins in cells using SDS - PAGE combined with immu - noblotting for polyubiquitin tagged proteins ( Figure 7C ) . We found as expected that incubation with the protea - some inhibitor MG - 132 resulted in accumulation of poly - ubiquitinated proteins . However , when Derlin - 1 or Sel1L were depleted by siRNAs and MG - 132 added , fewer poly - ubiquitinated proteins accumulated compared to control cells , suggesting that misfolded proteins failed to exit the ER and thus , failed to be ubiquitinated ( Figure 7D ) . Deple - tion of ERp57 by siRNAs had no effect while the depletion of PDI by siRNAs resulted in a clear reduction in the level of polyubiquitinated protein in the presence of MG - 132 ( Figure 7D ) . In ERp72 depleted cells , the situation was less clear . An increase was seen for the same siRNA that also dramatically enhanced SV40 infectivity ( Figure 7D ) . We concluded that when PDI levels were reduced , and retrotranslocation was impaired , SV40 infectivity was sup - pressed , while ERp72 depletion , which had the opposite effectonretrotranslocationofproteins , seemedtoenhance SV40 infectivity . Together with the effects of Derlin - 1 and Sel1L silencing , these results were consistent with a role for ER retrotranslocation in SV40 entry . DISCUSSION Our results indicated that SV40 has chosen the ER route of entry so that it can take advantage of the protein folding and quality control machinery in the ER for initial uncoating and membrane translocation . Through an ERp57 - cata - lyzed disulﬁde isomerization reaction in the ER lumen , a sub - population of pentamers ( most likely the 12 vertex pentamers ) are disconnected from an extensive network of disulﬁde crosslinked VP1 molecules in the capsid , the ﬁrst step in the uncoating of SV40 . The dependence on Derlin - 1 , Sel1L , and PDI suggested that the modiﬁed virus makes use of the ERAD pathway presumably for transport into the cytosol . We hypothesize that the vertex pentam - ers are lost when the virus reaches the low Ca 2 + in the cytosol . The overall strategy used by SV40 is thus similar to that previously described for cholera toxin but more elaborate due to the structural complexity of the particle ( Tsai et al . , 2001 ) . We found that the SV40 capsid is extensively cross - linked by interpentameric and possibly also intrapenta - meric C104 - C104 and C9 - C9 disulﬁde bonds between VP1 molecules . The C9 - C9 bonds are not visible in the X - ray structure because the terminal residues of the N - terminus are disordered ( Liddington et al . , 1991 ) . Through these bonds , virtually all VP1 molecules in the particle are covalently connected with each other . The main function of the disulﬁde bond network is most likely to stabilize the virus during extracellular passage . Al - though the virus remains intact after reduction of all disul - ﬁdes , it is less stable particularly in a low calcium environ - ment . Mutations in C9 , C104 , or both have been shown to result in formation of unstable particles that possess reduced infectivity ( Gharakhanian et al . , 2001 ) . Of the VP1 cysteines , C9 , C104 , and C257 are con - served amongpolyomaviruses . Interestingly , anextended disulﬁde bonded network is not present in mouse polyoma virus . The X - ray structure shows the presence of C19 - C114 intrachain disulﬁdes . In SV40 , these correspond to C9 - C104 disulﬁdes . Although polyoma virus also enters the ER , recent studies suggest that the uncoating mecha - nisms may be different ( Lilley et al . , 2006 ; Magnuson et al . , 2005 ) . A covalently crosslinked capsid shell obviously necessi - tates special measures during entry . To allow opening of the capsid and release of the viral chromosome , at least some of the crosslinks must be eliminated . We found that about 20 % of the VP1 molecules were in fact uncoupled from an otherwise intact network of disulﬁde - bonded VP1s . Since the VP1 s in the mature particle contain no in - trachain disulﬁde bonds , such bonds in the disconnected VP1s likely resulted from an isomerization reaction in which an interchain disulﬁde was isomerized to an intra - chain disulﬁde . When the acceptor cysteines were alky - lated , no isomerization was possible , no VP1 molecules were released , and the virus was noninfectious . When SV40 was incubated in a cytosolic extract or in glutathione redox buffers mimicking conditions in the ER or cytosol , there was no reduction or isomerization of disulﬁdes , con - sistent with the need for a thiol - disulﬁde oxidoreductase in the isomerization process . The evidence that ERp57 was the thiol - disulﬁde oxido - reductase required was four - fold . First , siRNA silencing of this abundant , soluble ER enzyme resulted in a 5 - fold reduction of SV40 infection . Second , with ERp57 silenced , VP1 disconnection from the disulﬁde crosslinked network did not occur . Third , incubation of SV40 in vitro with iso - lated ERp57 reproduced in every detail the observations made in vivo . Finally , infection by the C9A / C104A mutant that lacks disulﬁde bonds was not sensitive to ERp57 silencing . viruses ; while due to the overall heterogeneity in virus diameter in the DTT / EGTA - treated population , the structure shown is from one capsid to allow a clearer view for the hexameric capsomers . The missing vertex density was , despite the heterogeneity in this preparation , the striking feature of the structure averaged from all reconstructed DTT / EGTA - treated capsids . ( G ) Sedimentation of SV40 after incubation with ERp57 or PDI , and EGTA addition ( as in Figures 5D and 5E , lane 9 ) on a linear 5 % – 20 % sucrose gradient . Fractions were immunoblotted against VP1 . EGTA addition was essential for pentamer release . Cell 131 , 516 – 529 , November 2 , 2007 ª 2007 Elsevier Inc . 525 Our results suggested that ERp57 reduces a C9 - C9 disulﬁde and replaces it with the C9 - C104 intrachain disul - ﬁde by using the free C104 in the threesome of cysteines at the vertex as acceptor . The corresponding C19 - C114 disulﬁde of mouse polyomavirus indicated the feasibility of this connection ( Stehle et al . , 1996 ) . It is noteworthy , that only at the vertex , a cluster of three closely spaced C104 residues involving one VP1 of a ﬁve - coordinated pentamer and two VP1s in neighboring six - coordinated pentamers exists ( Stehle et al . , 1996 ; Figure S2 ) . The Figure 7 . Interference with ER to Cytosole Retrotranslocation Coincides with Pertubation of SV40 Infection ( A ) CV - 1 cells were infected with SV40 ( wild - type and cysteine mutants ) inthe presence or absence of the proteasome inhibitor MG - 132 ( 20 m M ) .

The data represent the average ± SD of three independent experiments . ( C ) HeLa cells were treated with MG - 132 for 16 hr . Cell lysates were subjected to SDS - PAGE and immunoblotted against ubiquitin . Shown are the polyubiquitinated proteins ( poly - Ub ) .

Poly - UB levels as compared to control cells ( Luciferase ) were depicted as mean ± SD . 526 Cell 131 , 516 – 529 , November 2 , 2007 ª 2007 Elsevier Inc . weak electron density in this region could be explained by ﬂexibility and / or by randomness as to which of the cyste - ines participate in the C104 - C104 disulﬁde bond ( Stehle et al . , 1996 ) . With two of the C104 cysteines disulﬁde bonded , one must remain reduced . Our results indicated that this free sulfhydryl was essential in the initial uncoat - ing process ; when it was alkylated the virus reached the ER but failed to infect . The second cysteine residue accessible for alkylation , C49 , is located too far from the disulﬁdes to serve as an acceptor for isomerization , and the properties of the C49A mutant virus did not differ from the wild - type . As a consequence of the loss of the C9 - C9 disulﬁde , the covalent connections between the vertex pentamers and the hexavalent neighbors are lost . Although 20 % of the VP1 molecules no longer participate in the disulﬁde - bondednetwork , allpentamersremainassociatedwiththe virus particle as long as the Ca 2 + ions are in place . Our in vitro experiments using cryo - electron tomography and mass spectrometry suggested that the pentamers discon - nected from the crosslinked network constitute the 12 vertex pentamers . At least in vitro , we found that the re - lease of these pentamers from a reduced particle required extraction of the Ca 2 + ions known to stabilize the interac - tion between VP1 and the C - terminal arm of a neighbor - ing VP1 . Thus , to release the vertex pentamers , both the covalent disulﬁde connections had to be broken and the C - terminal arms had to dissociate from the neighboring pentamers . Although clearly favored by our observations , a role for ERp57inSV40uncoatingraisedsomequestions . Howcan this enzyme reach cysteines and disulﬁde bonds located on the inner surface of the capsid wall ? The dimensions of ERp57 can be deduced from the crystal structure of the b - b 0 domain and analytical ultracentrifugation studies ; the thioredoxin - like domains have a diameter of about 3 . 5 nm ( Frickel et al . , 2004 ; Kozlov et al . , 2006 ) . The X - ray structure of the virus shows that the capsid wall has open - ings of about 3 - 5 nm in size ( Liddington et al . , 1991 ) , which may be big enough if one considers the dynamics of viral capsids , i . e . , so - called ‘‘breathing’’ ( Lewis et al . , 1998 ) , and if one assumes a ﬂexible structure for the oxidoreduc - tase ( Tian et al . , 2006 ) . Another question concerns the association of ERp57 with calnexin ( CNX ) and calreticulin ( CRT ) , and its function as a thiol - disulﬁde oxidoreductase for glycoproteins . We did not observe any effect on infectivity by inhibitors that block glycoprotein trimming and entry into the CNX / CRT cycle . siRNA silencing of CNX and CRT failed to affect virus infection . It is therefore likely that ERp57 interacts with SV40 independently of CNX and CRT . While essential for productive entry of the wild - type virus , we found that ERp57 was dispensable for the C9A / C104A mutant , a virus devoid of disulﬁde bonds . That this mutant virus was still sensitive to DTT , to proteasome inhibitors , and to the depletion of Derlin - 1 , Sel1L , and PDI indicated that there are ER - associated steps during entry beyondERp57 - inducedrearrangementofdisulﬁdebonds . That these events included translocation of the virus from the ER lumen to the cytosol was suggested by the identity of the factors and inhibitors identiﬁed . Derlin - 1 is a mem - brane protein involved in the translocation of ERAD sub - strates from the ER to the cytosol for degradation by pro - teasomes ( Ye et al . , 2004 ) . Sel1L is predicted to be a type I transmembrane protein and thought to function in sub - strate recognition for ERAD ( Mueller et al . , 2006 ) . PDI silencing has been shown to inhibit polyubiquitination of proteins and retrotranslocation of misfolded proteins ( For - ster et al . , 2006 ; Tsai et al . , 2002 ) , and proteasome inhib - itors can impair retrograde transport of ERAD substrates ( Hirsch and Ploegh , 2000 ) . Finally depletion of ERp72 , another abundant thiol - disulﬁde oxidoreductase , by an siRNA that enhanced retrotranslocation of ERAD sub - strates ( Figure 7B ) ( Forster et al . , 2006 ) , also enhanced SV40 infection . These observations indicate that SV40 exploits a ma - chinery in the ER normally reserved for identiﬁcation of misfolded proteins and for retrotranslocation of these proteins through the ER membrane . The ER is the only or - ganelle in the cell that possesses a retrotranslocation sys - tem for macromolecules , a system known to be exploited by certain bacterial toxins and possibly other viruses ( Lilley et al . , 2006 ; Tsai et al . , 2002 ) . How this interaction works for SV40 at the molecular level poses an interest - ing problem given the large size of the virus particles . Future work will have to obtain direct evidence on how the translocation of the virus from the ER to the cytosol is achieved . The overall process is likely to involve additional changes in the virus such as exposure of VP2 / VP3 either in the ER lumen or after translocation ( Daniels et al . , 2006 ; Norkin et al . , 2002 ) , and the exposure of nuclear localization signals required for import into the nucleus ( Clever et al . , 1991 ; Nakanishi et al . , 1996 ) . Although we have shown here that uncoating starts in the ER by the isomerization of disulﬁde bonds , we ﬁnd it likely that pen - tamers dissociate from the particle in the cytosol when the virus encounters a milieu with a low Ca 2 + concentration . The inhibitory effect of thapsigargin may be explained by the elevation in Ca 2 + in the cytosol ( Scharff et al . , 1988 ) . The stepwise uncoating program of SV40 , which we par - tially unraveled in this study , clearly provides many inter - esting questions for future investigation .
