In Study 1 , participants were asked to solve the Alternative Uses Task ( AUT ) problems when performing open or closed body posture inpositive or negative emotional staterespectively . The results showed thatoriginality ofAUT performance was higher inthe compatibleconditions ( i . e . , open - positiveand closed - neg - ative ) than inthe incompatible conditions ( i . e . , closed - positive and open - negative ) . InStudy 2 , the compatibility effect was replicated in both the AUT and the Realistic Presented Problem test ( i . e . , RPP ) . Moreover , it was re - vealed that participants exhibited the highest associative ﬂ exibility in the open - positive condition , and the highest persistence in the closed - negative condition . These ﬁ ndings indicate that compatibility between body posture and emotion is bene ﬁ cial for creativity . This may be because when the implicit emotions elicited by body posture match explicit emotions , the effects of emotions on creativity are enhanced , therefore promoting creativity through the ﬂ exibility or the persistence pathway respectively . © 2016 Elsevier B .

Introduction Creativity is de ﬁ ned as the ability to produce work that is novel ( original and unique ) and useful ( Sternberg & Lubart , 1996 ; Runco & Jaeger , 2012 ) . Previous studies revealed that emotions affected creative thinking , so did body motor actions . The current study aimed to exam - inewhetherandhowbodymotoractionsandemotionswouldintegrate to in ﬂ uence creative thinking . Notably , divergent thinking ( DT ) and convergent thinking ( CT ) are two fundamental processes of creative thinking . The current study focused on DT , given that DT performance has been demonstrated to be a reliable predictor of creative potential ( Runco & Acar , 2012 ) . 1 . 1 . Emotion , body motor action and creativity Emotions in ﬂ uence creative thinking . The dopaminergic theory of positive emotion suggests that the increased dopamine level in positive emotional states could improve the selection of or the switching among alternative cognitive sets , therefore enhancing creativity ( Ashby & Isen , 1999 ; Ashby , Valentin , & Turken , 2002 ) . The affect as in - formation model suggests that positive emotions signal a satisfactory and safe environment , which promotes simplifying heuristics or “ loose ” processing , and bene ﬁ ts creativity as a result ( Fiedler , 1988 , 2000 ; Schwarz , 1990 , 2002 ) . Recently , the dual pathway to creativity model ( De Dreu , Baas , & Nijstad , 2008 ) suggests that both positive and negative emotions could exert positive impacts on creativity . This model assumes that there are two pathways to creative performance , namely the ﬂ exibility pathway and the persistence pathway . Positive and negative emotions with high arousal in ﬂ uence creativity through ﬂ exibility and persistence pathways respectively . Speci ﬁ cally , positive emotions bene ﬁ t creativity by enhancing cognitive ﬂ exibility ; in this case , individuals break mental sets , reorganize cognitive structures , and generate various cognitive categories . Negative emotions bene ﬁ t creativity by enhancing cognitive persistence ; that is , individuals are perseverant in making effort on problems , think up ideas belonging to one category , and dig out more original ideas ( Baas , Roskes , Sligte , Nijstad , & De Dreu , 2013 ; Nijstad , De Dreu , Rietzschel , & Baas , 2010 ) . Body motor actions also in ﬂ uence creative thinking . For instance , Slepian and Ambady ( 2012 ) showed that ﬂ uid arm movements led to enhanced creativity . This may be because cognitive processing is em - bodied in sensorimotor systems , thus ﬂ uid movements lead to ﬂ uid thinking , which bene ﬁ ts creative idea generation ( Slepian & Ambady , 2012 ) . In addition , it was revealed that arm ﬂ exion ( compared with arm extension ) improved insight problem solving and promoted origi - nal idea generation ( Friedman & Förster , 2000 , 2002 ) . It suggests that arm extension or ﬂ exion give rise to bodily feedbacks associated with avoidance or approach respectively ( Cacioppo , Priester , & Berntson , 1993 ) , which triggers a local or global processing style to deal with the situation ( Förster & Dannenberg , 2010 ; Kuschel , Förster , & Denzler , 2010 ) . Global processing style would facilitate the ability to ac - tivate inaccessible conceptual representations and more abstract Acta Psychologica 173 ( 2017 ) 32 – 40 ⁎ Corresponding author at : School of Psychology and Cognitive Science , East China Normal University , No . 3663 , North Zhong Shan Road , Shanghai 200062 , China .

Contents lists available at ScienceDirect Acta Psychologica journal homepage : www . elsevier . com / locate / actpsy concepts ( e . g . , thinking of a brick as a “ reddish substance ” ) , which can trigger more remote concepts ( e . g . , “ makeup ” ) and thereby enhance performance in creativity tasks ( Hao , 2010 ; Ward , 2008 ; Ward , Patterson , & Sifonis , 2004 ) . A recent study demonstrated that theeffects of arm postures on creativity were in ﬂ uenced by body positions ( i . e . , being seated or horizontal ) ( Hao , Yuan , Hu , & Grabner , 2014 ) . This may be because in the horizontal body position , arm extension de - creases the physical distance between the self and an object in the hand and represents an approach motor action , while arm ﬂ exion in - creases the distance and re ﬂ ects an avoidance motor action . Thus , the associations of arm extension / ﬂ exion and approach / avoidance are re - verse in being seated or horizontal body positions . As a result , arm ﬂ ex - ionandextensioninthehorizontalpositionaffectcreativecognitionina reverse pattern compared to that in the seated position . Body motor actions in ﬂ uence emotions . For instance , participants in the open body posture felt more con ﬁ dent and performed better on the cognitive tasks ; whereas they felt lack of con ﬁ dence and performed worse in the closed body posture ( Briñol , Petty , & Wagner , 2009 ) . Given that the open body posture led individuals to feel more con ﬁ dent and dominant , individuals ' emotions were affected by social exclusion only when they took open posture rather than closed posture ( Welker , Oberleitner , Cain , & Carré , 2013 ) . A recent study demonstrated that in a relatively long period ( i . e . , 90 min ) , participants in the open posture reported more positive emotions , while those in theclosed pos - ture reported more negative emotions ( Zabetipour , Pishghadam , & Ghonsooly , 2015 ) . It suggests that open or closed body posture could serve as pleasant or unpleasant cues , eliciting implicit positive or nega - tiveemotions , whichmightre ﬂ ect on changes in testosterone , feeling of power and tolerance of risk ( Carney , Cuddy , & Yap , 2010 ) . 1 . 2 . Effects of psychological incompatibility or compatibility on creativity Plenty of studies indicated that psychological incompatibility could facilitate creative thinking . For example , individuals with rationalthink - ing styles showed better creative performance when instructed to solve problems using the intuitive problem - solving approach ( i . e . , incompat - ible condition ) relative to using the rational problem - solving approach ( i . e . , compatible condition ) ( Dane , Baer , Pratt , & Oldham , 2011 ) . Partic - ipants exhibited higher creativity when their pre - existing moods were incompatible with the induced emotions ( e . g . , low in depression vs . in - duced negative emotions ) , compared with they did in the compatible condition ( e . g . , low in depression vs . the induced positive emotions ) ( Forgeard , 2011 ) . Participants showed higher category inclusiveness and acceptance to alternatives in the incompatible conditions ( e . g . , re - call a happy event while frowning or a sad event while smiling ) ( Huang & Galinsky , 2011 ) . A typical explanation for the incompatibility effect is that individuals in the incompatible states tend to interpret problem situation as nonstandard , which triggers set - breaking cogni - tive processes and improves the ability to combine usually unrelated ideas together , thereby enhancing creativity ( Dane et al . , 2011 ) . However , some studies showed that psychological compatibility might positively affect creative thinking . It was reported that positive emotions bene ﬁ ted creativity when tasks were framed as enjoyable and intrinsically rewarding , so did negative emotions when tasks were framed as serious and extrinsically rewarding ( Martin , 2001 ; Martin & Stoner , 1996 ) . This was referred as the context - dependent effect of mood , which suggests that participants in an emotional incompatible condition would stop the activity sooner than participants in a compat - ible condition ( Martin , Ward , Achee , & Wyer , 1993 ; Zajusz - Gaw ę dzka & Marsza ł - Wi ś niewska , 2015 ) . Thus , participants performed worse in emotional incompatible condition than emotional compatible condi - tion . Furthermore , a meta - analysis showed that positive emotions bene ﬁ ted divergent thinking ( DT ) , while negative emotions facilitated convergent thinking ( CT ) ( Davis , 2009 ) . Given DT led to more positive emotions whereas CT had the opposite effect ( Chermahini & Hommel , 2012 ) , the ﬁ ndings indicated that compatibility of emotional states andthoughtprocesseswouldbene ﬁ tcreativity . Thismaybebecauseex - plorative processing strategy fostered by positive emotions would ben - e ﬁ t DT performance , while detail - oriented processing strategy fostered by negative emotions would be advantageous when one seeks the opti - mized solutions to the CT tasks . 1 . 3 . The present study Based on the above literature review , it is an open question whether incompatibility or compatibility between body posture and emotion is more likely to be bene ﬁ cial for creativity . Recall here that positive and negative emotions bene ﬁ t creativity through the ﬂ exibility and the per - sistence pathways respectively ( De Dreu et al . , 2008 ) . It is reasonable to infer that when body postures elicit implicit emotions that match indi - viduals ' explicit emotional states , this compatibility might enhance the effects of emotions on creativity ; whereas when implicit and explicit emotions do not match or even are con ﬂ ictive , such an incompatibility would neutralize the effects of emotions on creativity . However , there is an alternative prediction . That is , incompatibility of body postures and emotions might make people perceive problem situation as non - standard , which would foster people to think in a different way than they usually do , therefore enhancing creativity . To test the contradictory predictions aforementioned , we conducted two studies . In Study 1 , participants were asked to watch short emo - tion - appropriate videos to induce positive or negative emotional state respectively . Then they solved creativity problems when performing the open or closed body posture . This design allowed us to compare the effect of body posture and emotion ( i . e . , posture - emotion ) compat - ibility or incompatibility on creativity . In Study 2 , we replicated ﬁ ndings of Study 1 in different creativity tasks and in different time duration of task performance . We also explored the cognitive mechanism underly - ing the effect of posture - emotion combination on creativity . In both Study 1 and Study 2 , we measured the effortfulness in maintaining open or closed body posture after the experiment , in order to check whether effect of body posture on creativity was independent of the ef - fect of effortfulness in maintaining the given posture . Moreover , we measured participants ' feeling of power and enjoyment of the experi - mental tasks in Study 1 and Study 2 , given that feeling of power has been found to in ﬂ uence creative cognition ( Galinsky , Magee , Gruenfeld , Whitson , & Liljenquist , 2008 ; Gervais , Guinote , Allen , & Slabu , 2013 ; Sligte , De Dreu , & Nijstad , 2011 ) , and so has enjoyment of the experimental task ( Zenasni & Lubart , 2011 ) . This allowed an assess - mentof whether the open and closedbody postures in ﬂ uence creativity through inducing different feeling of power or enjoyment of the exper - imental task . 2 . Study 1 In Study 1 , we induced participants ' positive or negative emotions , and then asked them to work on a creativity - demanding task with the open or closed body posture . The main hypotheses were as follow . First , creative performance in positive emotions would show no differ - ence from that in negative emotions , given that positive and negative emotions bene ﬁ t creativity through two different pathways , as sug - gested by the dual pathway to creativity model . Second , creative perfor - mance in the compatible conditions ( i . e . , open - positive and closed - negative ) would be different from that in the incompatible conditions ( i . e . , open - negative and closed - negative ) . Notably , we cannot give pre - cise predictions before experiment , because both compatible and in - compatible conditions could potentially bene ﬁ t creativity . 2 . 1 . Participants One hundred and sixty college students , whose majors were not psychology , participated individually in the study . A 2 ( EMOTION : pos - itive and negative ) × 2 ( POSTURE : open and closed ) between - subject 33 N . Hao et al . / Acta Psychologica 173 ( 2017 ) 32 – 40 design was employed . Participants were randomly assigned into one of the four experimental conditions . The data of 11 participants were ex - cluded from further analysis , because these participants did not hold the given body posture during task performance . One participant who was originally assigned into the closed - positive condition completed thetaskintheopen - negativecondition . Thus , the ﬁ nalsampleconsisted of 149 participants ( 89 males , 60 females ; age ranged from 18 to 23 years old , M = 20 . 34 , SD = 2 . 13 ) . There were 41 , 35 , 36 , and 37 par - ticipants in the open - positive , open - negative , closed - positive , and closed - negative conditions respectively . They were all native Chinese speakers with normal hearing , normal vision or corrected vision , and with no limb disability . Participants gave written informed consent prior to the experiment , and received approximately 1 US dollar for their participation after the experiment . The protocol of the experiment was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee at East China Nor - mal University . 2 . 2 . Experimental task The Alternative Uses Task ( AUT ) ( Guilford , 1967 ) was used as the target task . It requires respondents to generateasmanyunusualor orig - inaluses as possibleforcommonobjects , suchasapaperclip ( e . g . , “ mak - ing a ring ” , “ cleaning ﬁ ngernails ” ) . The AUT is a well - established test of creative potential ( Guilford , 1967 ; Runco , 1991 , 1999 ; Runco & Mraz , 1992 ) . Performance on this task has been demonstrated to be a reliable predictor of actual , real - world creative performance ( Runco & Acar , 2012 ) . 2 . 3 . Experimental procedure First , participants were asked to watch videos to induce corre - sponding emotions ( see details in Emotion Inductions ) . Then they were asked to solve two AUT problems ( i . e . , “ brick ” and “ chopstick ” ) in 6 min ( 3 min per problem ) , with a 15 s break between the two problems . The sequences of problems were balanced for all partici - pants . In the instruction about how to solve the AUT problems , par - ticipants were encouraged to try their best to produce ideas that would be thought of by no one else , as suggested by Harrington ( 1975 ) and Torrance ( 1995 ) . Given that the arms were used to perform open or closed body pos - ture , participants could not write down their answers . Thus , they orally reported the ideas one by one during the epoch of working on an AUT problem . Theoralreportingofideaswaswidelyusedinpreviousstudies on DT tasks ( Friedman & Förster , 2002 ; Hao , Yuan , Cheng , Wang & Runco , 2015 ; Hao et al . , 2014 ; Oppezzo & Schwartz , 2014 ) . Participants ' oral responses for the AUT problems were recorded by a voice recorder and transcribed afterwards for further analysis . In the open body posture , participants stood in front of a desk , with one leg in the front and the other on the back . Ten ﬁ ngers were opened and the palms were put downward . The distance be - tween palms was slightly wider than shoulders . Participants put the weight on the hands and the front leg . In the closed body posture , participants stood in front of a desk , with legs crossed and with arms crossed in front of the chest tightly ( see Fig . 1 ) . The open posture took up more space and the whole chest was open , while the closed posture took up less space and the whole chest was closed ( Carney et al . , 2010 ) . 2 . 4 . Emotion inductions Participants watched short emotion - appropriate videos to induce corresponding emotions as in previous studies ( Forgas & East , 2008 ; Forgeard , 2011 ; Hao , Yuan , Cheng , Wang & Runco , 2015 ; Phillips , Bull , Adams , & Fraser , 2002 ; Rotteveel & Phaf , 2007 ) . The positive and nega - tive emotion - appropriate clips ( 2 min per clip ) were excerpted from comedy and tragic movies respectively . Before and immediately after watching the videos , participants rated the valence and arousal levels of their emotional states by completing the Self - Assessment Manikin ( SAM ) ( Bradley & Lang , 1994 ) , in which they selected one of nine rat - ings ( valence : 1 = very unpleasant , 9 = very pleasant ; arousal : 1 = not exciting at all , 9 = very exciting ) illustrated by ﬁ ve cartoon ﬁ gures and the points between any two ﬁ gures . 2 . 5 . Post - experimental tests Immediately after participants completed the experiment , their en - joyment of the experimental task was measured by the question “ How did you like the experimental task ? ” on a scale from 1 ( not in the least ) to 9 ( very much ) , as in previous studies ( Friedman & Förster , 2000 , 2002 ) . Participants ' feeling of power was measured by the question “ How much power did you feel ” on a scale from 1 ( not at all ) to 9 ( very much ) . Participants ' effortfulness in maintaining the given body posture was measured by the question “ How effortful was it to maintain the open / closed body posture ? ” on a scale from 1 ( not at all effortful ) to 9 ( very effortful ) . 2 . 6 . Assessments of performance on AUT problems Participants ' performance on the AUT problem was measured by the scores of ﬂ uency and originality ( Guilford , 1967 ; Runco , 1991 ) . Fluency scores were based on the total number of ideas given in the AUT problem . Originality scores were based on statistically infre - quent responses . To this end , the ideas that all participants generated for the AUT problem were collected into a comprehensive lexicon . Synonyms were identi ﬁ ed and ideas collapsed accordingly . If a re - sponse was statistically infrequent ( i . e . , if 5 % or fewer participants in the sample gave the response ) , then it was given a score of “ 1 ” . All other responses received scores of “ 0 ” , regardless of how often they appeared . Following this scoring procedure , two trained raters independently assessed the originality of the two AUT problems for every participant . The inter - rater agreement ( ICCs = 0 . 95 ) was sat - isfactory . The internal consistency of the ﬂ uency in solving these two problems was satisfactory ( Cronbach ' s alpha coef ﬁ cient = 0 . 79 ) , so was that of the originality ( Cronbach ' s alpha coef ﬁ cient = 0 . 83 ) . Finally , the ﬂ uency and originality scores in solving two prob - lems were averaged for every participant . Fig . 1 .

Manipulation check for clarity It was necessary to check whether watching emotion - appropriate videos did induce the corresponding emotions . A repeated measures ANOVA with Time Point ( TIME : pre - vs . post - induction ) as a within - subject factor and Emotion Induction ( INDUCTION : positive vs . nega - tive ) as a between - subject factor was performed on the valence level . There was a signi ﬁ cant interaction effect of TIME × INDUCTION , F ( 1 , 147 ) = 528 . 81 , p b 0 . 001 , η p 2 = 0 . 78 ( see Table 1 ) . In the pre - induction time point , the valence level showed no difference between two induc - tion conditions , t ( 147 ) = 1 . 51 , p = 0 . 14 ; while in the post - induction time point , the valence level was signi ﬁ cantly higher in the positive than in the negative induction condition , t ( 147 ) = 22 . 85 , p b 0 . 001 , Cohen ' s d = 3 . 78 . Moreover , the valence level increased from the ﬁ rst to the second time point in the positive condition , t ( 76 ) = 11 . 92 , p b 0 . 001 , Cohen ' s d = 1 . 85 , but decreased in the negative condition , t ( 71 ) = 26 . 65 , p b 0 . 001 , Cohen ' s d = 3 . 44 . These results indicated that watching emotion - appropriate videos did actually induce positive and negative emotions . Another repeated measures ANOVA on the arousal level revealed a signi ﬁ cant effect of TIME , F ( 1 , 147 ) = 631 . 6 , p b 0 . 001 , η p 2 = 0 . 81 ( see Table 1 ) . Overall , the arousal level was higher in the post - than in the pre - induction time point . However , there was neither the main effect of INDUCTION nor the interaction effect of TIME × INDUCTION . These results indicated that participants ' arousal level increased after watching videos , but showed no difference between positive and nega - tive induction conditions . 2 . 7 . 2 . Interaction effect of body posture and emotion on AUT performance A two - wayMANOVA with POSTURE ( open vs . closed ) and EMOTION ( positive vs . negative ) as between - subject factors was performed on AUT originality and ﬂ uency . Box ' s M = 35 . 51 , p b 0 . 001 . POSTURE or EMOTION did not exert main effect on AUT performance . But , there was a signi ﬁ cant interaction effect of these two factors on AUT ﬂ uency and originality , F ( 2 , 144 ) = 8 . 87 , p b 0 . 001 , η p 2 = 0 . 11 . Speci ﬁ cally , there was a signi ﬁ cant interaction effect of POSTURE × EMOTION on AUT ﬂ uency , F ( 1 , 147 ) = 6 . 22 , p b 0 . 01 , η p 2 = 0 . 04 . In the open posture , the ﬂ uency scores ( M = 8 . 72 , SD = 5 . 31 ) with pos - itive emotion were signi ﬁ cantly higher than those ( M = 6 . 17 , SD = 3 . 37 ) with negative emotion ( post hoc LSD test , p b 0 . 01 ) ; yet no dif - ference was observed between positive and negative emotions in the closed posture ( see Fig . 2A ) . Also , there was a signi ﬁ cant POSTURE × EMOTION interaction on AUT originality , F ( 1 , 149 ) = 16 . 22 , p b 0 . 001 , η p 2 = 0 . 10 . In the open posture , participants produced ideas with higher originality with positive emotion ( M = 2 . 85 , SD = 2 . 51 ) than with negative emotion ( M = 1 . 33 , SD = 1 . 33 ) ( p b 0 . 001 ) . By contrast , in the closed posture , participants generated ideas with lower originality with positive emotion ( M = 1 . 43 , SD = 1 . 18 ) than with negative emotion ( M = 2 . 32 , SD = 1 . 87 ) ( p b 0 . 05 ) ( see Fig . 2B ) . 2 . 7 . 3 . Effects of emotional valence and arousal on AUT performance Linear regressions were conducted with the post - induction valence and arousal levels as predictors and task performance as the dependent variable . In the open posture , the valence positively predicted AUT ﬂ u - ency ( R adj2 = 0 . 16 , F = 7 . 88 , p b 0 . 001 ; β = 0 . 42 , p b 0 . 001 ) and AUT originality ( R adj2 = 0 . 25 , F = 12 . 44 , p b 0 . 001 ; β = 0 . 50 , p b 0 . 001 ) . In the closed posture , the valence ( β = − 0 . 23 , p b 0 . 05 ) and arousal ( β = − 0 . 24 , p b 0 . 05 ) negatively predicted AUT originality ( R adj2 = 0 . 08 , F = 4 . 21 , p b 0 . 05 ) , but they were not signi ﬁ cant predictors for AUT ﬂ uency ( R adj2 = 0 . 02 , F = 1 . 84 , p = 0 . 17 ) . 2 . 7 . 4 . Effortfulness , feeling of power , enjoyment for the experimental task and AUT performance A MANOVA with experimental condition as the between - subject factor was performed on self - rated effortfulness , feeling of power , and enjoyment for the experimental task . Box ' s M = 29 . 87 , p N 0 . 05 . There was no effect of experimental condition on these three variables , F ( 9 , 435 ) = 0 . 78 , p N 0 . 05 , η p 2 = 0 . 02 . After these three variables entered into the MANOVA model as co - variates , there was still a signi ﬁ cant interaction effect of POSTURE × EMOTION on AUT ﬂ uency and originality , F ( 2 , 141 ) = 8 . 64 , p b 0 . 001 , η p 2 = 0 . 11 . Enjoyment for the experimental task was positively correlated with AUT ﬂ uency and feeling of power ( ps b 0 . 001 ) . AUT ﬂ uency showed a positive correlation with AUT originality ( p b 0 . 001 ) . There was no cor - relation between other factors ( see Table 2 ) .

Hao et al . / Acta Psychologica 173 ( 2017 ) 32 – 40 3 . Study 2 In Study 1 , we found that AUT originality was higher in the posture - emotion compatible conditions than in the incompatible conditions . In Study 2 , we aimed to ( 1 ) replicate the ﬁ ndings in the realistic crea - tive - demanding task besides AUT , ( 2 ) test the compatibility effect in a longer period of task performance ( i . e . , 5 min ) , and ( 3 ) explore the cog - nitive mechanism underlyingthe compatibility effect . Based on the dual pathway to creativity model ( De Dreu et al . , 2008 ) , we proposed that the open - positive and closed - negative conditionsbene ﬁ t creativity through the ﬂ exibilityandthepersistencepathways respectively . Totestthishy - pothesis , participants ' associative ﬂ exibility was measured by the asso - ciation - chain task ( Benedek , Könen , & Neubauer , 2012 ) . We predicted that participants would exhibit the highest ﬂ exibility in the open - posi - tive condition . Furthermore , the time duration till participants stop conducting the experimental task may serve as one measure of their processingeffort involved in the task ( Martin et al . , 1993 ) . This timedu - ration was referred as time - on - task , indicating participants ' persistence in performing the target task ( De Dreu et al . , 2008 ; De Dreu , Nijstad , Baas , Wolsink , & Roskes , 2012 ) . Similarly , we recorded the time dura - tion till participants provided the last idea when they solved a DT prob - lem , which may re ﬂ ect participants ' persistence in solving the problem . We predicted that the time duration would be longest in the closed - negative condition . 3 . 1 . Participants One hundred and thirty college students ( 45 males , 85 females ; age ranged from19 to 26 years old , M = 22 . 06 , SD = 1 . 68 ) were recruitedin this study . None of them participated in Study 1 . The experimental de - sign was the same as in Study 1 . Participants were randomly assigned into the open - positive , open - negative , closed - positive , and closed - neg - ative conditions , in which there were 30 , 33 , 34 and 33 participants re - spectively . Participants gave written informed consent prior to the experiment , and received approximately 3 US dollar for their participa - tionafterthe experiment . Theprotocol of theexperimentwasapproved by the Institutional Ethics Committee at East China Normal University . 3 . 2 . Experimental task Besides the AUT , the Realistic Presented Problem ( RPP ; Okuda , Runco , & Berger , 1991 ; Runco , 2013 ) was adopted in Study 2 . It requires respondents to produce as many solutions as possible to the problems which may occur at school and work . The “ ﬂ at tire ” problem was used in this study : “ You are about to ride your bike to school , as you always do , and today you are meeting a friend to plan a school project . But you have a ﬂ at tire ! You only have about 10 minutes of leeway . You might be able to ﬁ x the ﬂ at tire in that time , but ﬁ rst you consider alter - natives . What ways could you get the bike to work or get to school on time for the important meeting ? ” The RPP is a typical open - ended test of divergent thinking and creativity potential . The association - chain task ( Benedek et al . , 2012 ) was used to assess associative ﬂ exibility . It requires participants to generate long and di - versi ﬁ ed chains of associations . That is , only the ﬁ rst association should relate to the presented concept , whereas all following associations had to relate to the respectively last associative response ( e . g . , summer : “ beach , sand , castle , knight , horse , race …” ) . The number of discrimina - ble concepts included in the generated word association chains was conceived to index spontaneous associative ﬂ exibility . 3 . 3 . Experimental procedure Participants were asked to watch videos in order to induce corre - sponding emotions . Afterwards , theyperformed theopen orclosed pos - ture , and then solved one AUT ( i . e . , “ water bottle ” ) and one RPP ( i . e . , “ ﬂ at tire ” ) in 10 min ( 5 min per problem ) , with a 15 s break between the two problems . We recorded the time duration till participants pro - vided the last idea ( solution ) when solving the AUT and RPP problems respectively . Thesequencesof AUTandRPPwere balancedforallpartic - ipants . After a 60 s break , participants solved ﬁ ve association - chain problems ( 1 min per problem ) . Participants ' oral responses were re - corded by a voice recorder and transcribed afterwards for further analysis . 3 . 4 . Emotion inductions The procedure of emotion inductions was the same as in Study 1 . 3 . 5 . Post - experimental tests As in Study I , enjoyments of AUT and RPP , feeling of power and ef - fortfulness in maintaining the given body posture were measured respectively . 3 . 6 . Assessments of task performance AUT performance was measured by ﬂ uency and originality . The scoring procedure of AUT originality was exactly the same as in Study 1 . The inter - rater agreement was satisfactory ( two raters , ICC = 0 . 94 ) . RPP performance was also measured by ﬂ uency based on the number of responses and originality based on statistically infrequent responses . However , the scoring standard of originality was slightly different from that in AUT . Given that there was a small number of potential solutions to the “ ﬂ at tire ” problem and a large sample of participants , the re - sponses provided by 5 % or fewer participants were really rare . Thus we modi ﬁ ed the scoring standard . That is , responses generated by ≤ 5 % , 6 – 10 % , 11 – 15 % , or N 15 % participants in the sample received 3 , 2 , 1 , and 0 point respectively . Two trained raters independently assessed the RPP originality based on the standard above . The inter - rater agree - ment was satisfactory ( ICC = 0 . 99 ) . Performance on the association - chain task was measured on the number of discriminable concepts ( see Benedek et al . , 2012 ) . Scores on ﬁ ve association - chain problems were averaged for every participant . 3 . 7 . Results 3 . 7 . 1 .

Furthermore , the valence level increased from the ﬁ rst to the second time point in the positive condition , t ( 63 ) = 6 . 15 , p b 0 . 001 , Cohen ' s d = 0 . 76 , but decreased in the negative condition , t ( 65 ) = 11 . 86 , p b 0 . 001 , Cohen ' s d = 1 . 77 . These results indicated that watching emo - tion - appropriate videos did induce positive and negative emotions .

The arousal level was higher in the post - than in the pre - induction time point . That is , participants ' emotional arousal increased after watching videos . 3 . 7 . 2 . Interaction effect of body posture and emotion on AUT performance AMANOVAwithPOSTUREandEMOTIONasbetween - subjectfactors was performed on AUT originality and ﬂ uency . Box ' s M = 21 . 57 , p b 0 . 05 . As in Study 1 , there was no main effect of POSTURE or EMO - TION , but a signi ﬁ cant interaction effect of POSTURE × EMOTION on AUT originality and ﬂ uency , F ( 2 , 125 ) = 5 . 74 , p b 0 . 01 , η p 2 = 0 . 08 . Speci ﬁ cally , there was a signi ﬁ cant interaction effect of POSTURE × EMOTION on AUT ﬂ uency , F ( 1 , 126 ) = 11 . 57 , p b 0 . 01 , η p 2 = 0 . 08 . In the open posture , the ﬂ uency scores ( M = 17 . 97 , SD = 7 . 28 ) in positive emotion were signi ﬁ cantly higher than those ( M = 13 , SD = 6 . 11 ) in negative emotion ( post hoc LSD test , p b 0 . 01 ) , but no difference was observed between two emotional conditions in the closed posture ( see Fig . 3A ) . There was also a signi ﬁ cant interaction effect of POSTURE × EMO - TION on AUT originality , F ( 1 , 126 ) = 7 . 59 , p b 0 . 01 , η p 2 = 0 . 01 . In the open posture , participants produced ideas with higher originalityscores in positive emotion ( M = 5 . 28 , SD = 3 . 21 ) than in negative emotion ( M = 3 . 64 , SD = 2 . 70 ) ( p b 0 . 05 ) ; while in the closed posture , the orig - inality scores ( M = 4 . 13 , SD = 3 . 12 ) in positive emotion were margin - ally signi ﬁ cantly lower than those ( M = 5 . 62 , SD = 3 . 92 ) in negative emotion ( p = 0 . 062 ) ( see Fig . 3B ) . 3 . 7 . 3 . Interaction effect of body posture and emotion on RPP performance Another MANOVA with POSTURE and EMOTION with between - sub - ject factors were conducted on RPP ﬂ uency or originality . Box ' s M = 37 . 58 , p b 0 . 001 . There was no main effect of POSTURE or EMOTION , but an interaction effect of POSTURE × EMOTION on RPP ﬂ uency and originality , F ( 2 , 125 ) = 4 . 54 , p b 0 . 05 , η p 2 = 0 . 07 . Speci ﬁ cally , there was an interaction effect of POSTURE × EMOTION on RPP ﬂ uency , F ( 1 , 126 ) = 7 . 00 , p b 0 . 01 , η p 2 = 0 . 05 . In the open pos - ture , the ﬂ uency scores ( M = 10 . 3 , SD = 3 . 93 ) in positive emotion were signi ﬁ cantly higher than those ( M = 7 . 58 , SD = 3 . 78 ) in negative emotion ( p b 0 . 05 ) ; but intheclosed posture , the ﬂ uency scores showed no difference between two emotional conditions ( see Fig . 4A ) . There was also an interaction effect of POSTURE × EMOTION on RPP originality , F ( 1 , 126 ) = 8 . 66 , p b 0 . 01 , η p 2 = 0 . 06 . In the open posture , participants produced higher original ideas in positive emotion ( M = 7 . 6 , SD = 8 . 05 ) than in negative emotion ( M = 3 . 98 , SD = 4 . 48 ) ( p b 0 . 05 ) ; but in the closed posture , participants produced lower orig - inal ideas in positive emotion ( M = 5 . 47 , SD = 4 . 46 ) than in negative emotion ( M = 8 . 74 , SD = 8 . 69 ) ( p b 0 . 05 ) ( see Fig . 4B ) . 3 . 7 . 4 . Persistence in solving AUT and RPP problems in four experimental conditions Time duration till participants provided the last idea for AUT prob - lems showed differences among four conditions , F ( 1 , 126 ) = 5 . 92 , p b 0 . 001 , η p 2 = 0 . 12 . Time duration ( sec ) in the closed - negative condi - tion ( M = 285 , SD = 26 . 46 ) was signi ﬁ cantly longer than that in the open - negative condition ( M = 245 . 45 , SD = 55 . 39 ) ( Post hoc LSD test , p b 0 . 01 ) , but showed no difference with that in the open - positive condition ( M = 276 . 83 , SD = 34 . 43 ) and in the closed - positive condi - tion ( M = 270 . 44 , SD = 38 . 27 ) . Likewise , time duration in solving RPP problem showed signi ﬁ cant differences among four conditions , F ( 1 , 126 ) = 6 . 01 , p b 0 . 001 , η p 2 = 0 . 13 . Post hoc LSD tests revealed that time duration in the closed - negative condition ( M = 269 . 55 , SD = 47 . 09 ) wassigni ﬁ cantly longerthan that intheopen - negative condition ( M = 213 . 64 , SD = 65 . 95 ) , the open - positive condition ( M = 239 . 50 , SD = 44 . 8 ) and the closed - positive condition ( M = 223 . 97 , SD = 65 . 83 ) , p b 0 . 001 , p b 0 . 01 , p b 0 . 05 , respectively . 3 . 7 . 5 .

Participants exhibited the highest associative ﬂ exibility in the open - positive condition ( M = 19 . 79 , SD = 5 . 93 ) than in any other three conditions ( open - negative : M = 14 . 99 , SD = 4 . 74 , p b 0 . 001 ; closed - positive : M = 16 . 69 , SD = 5 . 14 , p b 0 . 05 ; closed - negative : M = 16 . 07 , SD = 4 . 88 , p b 0 . 01 ) . 3 . 7 . 6 .

Effortfulness , feeling of power , enjoyment for experimental tasks , AUT and RPP performance A MANOVA with experimental condition as the between - subject factor was performed on effortfulness , feeling of power , and enjoyment fortheexperimentaltasks . Box ' sM = 11 . 34 , p N 0 . 05 . Therewasnoeffect of experimental condition on these three variables , F ( 9 , 378 ) = 0 . 79 , p N 0 . 05 , η p 2 = 0 . 01 . After these three variables entered into the MANOVA model as co - variates , there was still a signi ﬁ cant interaction effect of POSTURE × EMOTION on AUT ﬂ uency and originality , F ( 2 , 122 ) = 4 . 27 , p b 0 . 05 , η p 2 = 0 . 07 , as well on RPP ﬂ uency and originality , F ( 2 , 122 ) = 4 . 54 , p b 0 . 05 , η p 2 = 0 . 07 . Correlation analyses showed that enjoyment for AUT was positively correlated with AUT ﬂ uency ( p b 0 . 01 ) and associative ﬂ exibility ( p b 0 . 01 ) . There were signi ﬁ cant positive correlations between any of two variables among AUT ﬂ uency , AUT originality , RPP ﬂ uency , RPP originality , and associative ﬂ exibility ( ps b 0 . 01 ) ( see Table 4 ) . 4 . Discussion In this study , we tested whether compatibility or incompatibility be - tween body posture and emotion was bene ﬁ cial for creativity . In Study 1 , we asked participants to solve AUT problems in positive or negative emotional state when performing the open or closed body posture respectively . The results revealed a compatibility effect that AUT originality was higher in the compatible conditions than in the incom - patible conditions . In Study2 , wesuccessfullyreplicated thecompatibil - ity effect inboth the AUT and the RPP . Also , we con ﬁ rmed this effectin a longer period of time performance . Thus , the current study discovered that compatibility of body posture and emotion bene ﬁ ts creative performance . Overall , creative performance showed no difference in the positive and negative emotion conditions . This ﬁ nding was in line with the dual pathway to creativity model ( De Dreu et al . , 2008 ) , which assumes that both positive and negative emotions could exert positive impacts on creativity through different pathways . Interestingly , one of the novel ﬁ ndings of this study was that people generated ideas ( solutions ) with higher originality in the posture - emotion compatible conditions . As illustrated in Fig . 1 , participants stretched out and took more space in the open body posture , while curled up and took less space in the closed bodyposture . Open and closedbody postures mightelicit implic - it positive and negative emotions ( Briñol et al . , 2009 ; Carney et al . , 2010 ) . Consequently , when the open posture met positive emotion or the closed posture met negative emotion , the compatibility of implicit emotions ( elicited by body postures ) and explicit emotions ( induced by watching videos ) might enhance the effects of emotions on creativi - ty , therefore promoting creativity . In contrast , in the other two condi - tions ( i . e . , positive - closed and negative - open ) , the implicit and explicit emotions were con ﬂ ictive ; thus , this incompatibility would weaken the effects of emotions on creativity . Although open - positive and closed - negative conditions both en - hanced creativity , we proposed that cognitive mechanism underlying the bene ﬁ cial effects of these two conditions might be different . Clearly , the open - positive condition induced positive emotions , whereas the Fig . 4 .

Basedonthe dual pathway to creativity model ( De Dreu et al . , 2008 ) , it could be predicted that the open - positive and closed - negative promote originality of idea generation through the ﬂ exibility and the persistence pathways respec - tively . In Study 2 , we measured participants ' associative ﬂ exibility by means of the association - chain task ( Benedek et al . , 2012 ) and the results showed that participants exhibited the highest associative ﬂ exi - bility in the open - positive condition . This ﬁ nding indicated that the open - positiveconditionmightfacilitatetheassociative ﬂ exibility , there - by promoting creative idea generation . Inspired by the previous studies ( De Dreu et al . , 2008 ; De Dreu et al . , 2012 ; Martin et al . , 1993 ) , we recorded the time duration till participants provided the last idea ( solution ) when they solved the creativity problems . This time duration could be conceived as an index of persistence in working on the target problems . As we predicted , participants showed the highestpersistence in solving the AUT and RPP problems in the closed - negative condition . This ﬁ nding indicated that closed - negative condition might help partic - ipants think up or dig out highly original ideas , thus bene ﬁ ting creative idea generation through the persistence pathway . Participants generated much more ideas ( i . e . , higher ﬂ uency ) in the open - positive condition than in the open - negative condition ( see Figs . 2A , 3A , 4A ) . This may be because higher associative ﬂ exibility in the open - positive condition facilitated participants to produce plenty of ideas . Notably , the ﬂ uency scores in the closed - negative condition were not higher than those in the closed - positive condition . We sug - gested that participants could think up or dig out highly original ideas through the persistence pathway in the negative - closed condition , but they did not necessarily generate plenty of ideas . Thelinearregressionsrevealedthatthevalencelevelofemotionwas a positive predictor for the originality scores in the open body posture , but a negative predictor in the closed body posture . That is , the more positive the emotions in the open posture were , or the more negative the emotions in the closed posture were , the higher originality of idea generation would be . These ﬁ ndings provided further evidence to sup - port the compatibility effect between body posture and emotion in cre - ative thinking . In Study 1 , the arousal level of emotion was found to be a negative predictor for the originality scores in the closed body posture . The closed body posture might elicit a prevention focus . High arousal in the prevention - focused states would be associated with local pro - cessing and a narrowed focus of attention , thereby impeding creative performance ( Baas , De Dreu , & Nijstad , 2008 ; Baas , De Dreu , & Nijstad , 2011 ; Friedman & Förster , 2008 ) . Accordingly , the higher arousal in the closed body posture were , the lower originality of idea generation wouldbe . However , our studydid notinvestigate thepreventionorpro - motion focuses directly , and the ﬁ nding was not replicated in Study 2 , thus further research is necessary . Enjoyment for the experimental task was found to be a positive pre - dictorforAUT ﬂ uency ( seeTables 2 and 4 ) . This resultcorroboratedpre - vious ﬁ ndings that enjoyment for the target task enhanced creative performance ( Abele - Brehm , 1992 ; Hao et al . , 2014 ; Zenasni & Lubart , 2011 ) . The interaction effects of body posture and emotion on AUT and RPP performance were not confounded by the effects of enjoyment for the experimental task , feeling of power and effortfulness of main - taining body posture . The results suggested that these three factors did not supersede or mediate the positive effects of compatibility be - tween body posture and emotion on creative idea generation . There were three limitations of this study . First , only verbal DT tasks ( i . e . , AUT and RPP ) were employed in this research . Further research should adopt ﬁ gural DT tasks ( e . g . , Picture Construction ) ( Torrance , 1966 ) and CT tasks ( e . g . , the Remote Associates Test , RAT ) ( Mednick , 1962 ) to test the generality of the compatibility effect . Second , besides open and closed body postures , there are many other body motor ac - tions that could serve as implicit emotional cues ( e . g . , arm ﬂ exion and arm extension ) . Further research should also assess the reliability of the compatibility effect in the contexts of various body motor actions . Third , the emotions induced by videos had limited generalizability . The emotions induced by real - life events may have more enduring ef - fects and distinct from those induced by video . Further research could adopt various ways ( e . g . , olfactory stimuli , music , imagination , comput - er game , casual game , etc . ) to induce emotions .
