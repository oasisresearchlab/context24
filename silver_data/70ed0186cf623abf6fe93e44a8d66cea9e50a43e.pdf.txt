However , approximately one - third of these patients develop recurrence , which remains the main cause of mortality in the postsurgical treatment of NSCLC . Many molecular markers have been proposed to predict recurrence of early - stage disease , but no marker has demonstrated sufficient reliability for clinical application . In the present study , the novel protein EF - hand domain - containing protein D2 ( EFHD2 ) was identified as expressed in highly metastatic tumor cells . EFHD2 increased the formation of protrusive invadopodia structures and cell migration and invasion abilities and promoted the epithelial - to - mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) character of lung adenocarcinoma cells . We demonstrated that the mechanism of EFHD2 in enhancing EMT occurs partly through inhibition of caveolin - 1 ( CAV1 ) for cancer progression . The expression of EFHD2 was significantly correlated with postsurgical recurrence of patients with stage I lung adenocarcinoma in the Kaplan - Meier - plotter cancer database search and our retrospective cohort study ( HR , 6 . 14 ; 95 % CI , 2 . 40 – 15 . 74 ; P < 0 . 001 ) . Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that EFHD2 expression was an independent clinical predictor for this disease . We conclude that EFHD2 expression is associated with increased metastasis and EMT and could serve as an independent marker to predict postsurgical recurrence of patients with stage I lung adenocarcinoma . Non - small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) is one of the most common causes of cancer death in the developed world 1 . Surgical resection is the standard treatment for patients with early - stage NSCLC . However , the relatively high risk of recurrence remains the main cause of mortality in the postsurgical treatment of NSCLC . According to clinical statistics , 30 – 35 % stage I NSCLC patients subjected to surgical treatment experience local and / or distant recur - rence during a 5 - year follow - up period 2 , 3 . The 5 - year survival rate is 66 – 84 % in stage IA and 53 – 66 % in stage IB 4 . In recent decades , considerable effort has been made to identify suitable factors related to postsurgical recur - rence using clinical parameter or molecular marker approaches 5 , 6 . For precise prediction of tumor recurrence , proteins could serve as a more ideal marker to monitor cancer prognosis because proteins are highly relevant to biological functions . Thus , most currently available markers are proteins . Numerous strategies have been used to discover markers for recurrence prediction , including comparative analysis by comparing the differential protein 1 Department of Superintendent Office , Mackay Memorial Hospital , Taipei , Taiwan . 2 Department of Medical Laboratory Science and Biotechnology , Yuanpei University , Hsinchu , Taiwan . 3 Research Center for Tumor Medical Science , China Medical University , Taichung , Taiwan . 4 Graduate Institute of Biomedical Sciences , China Medical University , Taichung , Taiwan . 5 School of Chinese Medicine , China Medical University , Taichung , Taiwan . 6 Genetics Center , Department of Medical Research , China Medical University Hospital , Taichung , Taiwan . 7 Center for Molecular Medicine , China Medical University Hospital , Taichung , Taiwan . 8 Genomics Research Center , Academia Sinica , Taipei , Taiwan . 9 Institute of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology , National Yang - Ming University , Taipei , Taiwan . 10 Department of Chemistry , National Taiwan University , Taipei , Taiwan . 11 Institute of Atomic & Molecular Sciences , Academia Sinica , Taipei , Taiwan .

The combination of known malignant factors as an integrated marker set to predict cancer recurrence is another commonly used method . Given that no marker developed by traditional methods has been sufficiently effective for clinical application , we choose an alternate approach to uncover novel markers . Although tumors exhibit significant histological heterogeneity , we sought to assess whether tumor cells use a similar mechanism to promote metastasis at a very early stage of disease . Thus , we assumed that common proteins are involved in metastasis at an early stage of disease in various cancers . Based on this assumption , we combined comparative proteomics and intersectional analysis to identify metastasis - related proteins from three pairs of tumor cells . Surprisingly , only one candidate , namely , EF - hand domain - containing protein D2 ( EFHD2 ) , exhibited overexpression in all highly metastatic tumor cell lines . EFHD2 is a 27 - kDa highly conserved calcium - binding protein that is located in membrane lipid rafts 7 . EFHD2 is widely expressed in brain and immune cells , including B cells , CD4 + / CD8 + T cells , natural killer cells , and peripheral blood mononuclear cells 8 . EFHD2 is involved in immune cell activation through regulating the activity of Src kinase , a key factor for the signaling of adaptive and innate immune receptors 9 . EFHD2 dysfunction is asso - ciated with autoimmune and neuropathological diseases , such as rheumatoid arthritis 10 , Parkinson’s disease 11 , and Alzheimer’s disease 12 . EFHD2 is characterized as an actin - binding protein that induces the formation of actin bundling through its EF - hand motif and the coiled - coil domain 13 . The interaction between EFHD2 and F - actin modulates membrane dynamics , such as lamellipodia formation 14 . Recently , EFHD2 enhances cell migration velocity by activating the Rho family of small GTPases in mouse B16F10 melanoma cells , suggesting the potential role of EFHD2 in cancer metastasis 15 . In lung cancer , the correlation between EFHD2 and cancer metastasis is unclear , and whether EFHD2 is related to postsurgical recurrence of stage I NSCLC remains to be determined . The scaffold protein caveolin - 1 ( CAV1 ) , a principal component of caveolar membrane coat , regulates multiple cancer - associated processes , including cellular transformation , tumor growth and survival , cell migration and metastasis , and multidrug resistance 16 . CAV1 harbors tumor suppressor or oncoprotein properties dependent on disease stage 17 and cancer type 18 . CAV1 inhibits the cell cycle and cell proliferation at the early stage of tumorigen - esis , whereas it induces progressive processes , such as metastasis , at late stage of disease 19 . In lung cancer , reduced CAV1 protein levels are commonly observed 20 . CAV1 mRNA and protein levels were downregulated during cell transformation by oncogenes , such as Ha - Ras , v - Abl , Myc , and Neu , suggesting a negatively regulatory role of CAV1 in tumor development 21 . In addition , the suppression of CAV1 leads to the activation of endocytosis 22 , which is involved in the regulation of cell migration and cancer metastasis 23 . Through a comparative proteomic analysis , CAV1 was identified to exhibit negative regulation by EFHD2 in the present study . Thus , we explored the mechanism of EFHD2 in increasing the metastatic ability of lung tumor cells via suppression of CAV1 . Materials and Methods Cell lines and cell culture . Human colorectal cancer cells SW480 and SW620 , human bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS - 2B , and lung adenocarcinoma cells A549 and H1299 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC , Maryland , USA ) . Human esophageal cancer cells CE81T / VGH and CE146T / VGH were obtained from the Bioresource Collection and Research Center ( BCRC , Hsinchu , Taiwan ) . Human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines CL1 - 0 and CL1 - 5 - F4 ( F4 ) were a gift from Dr . Pan - Chyr Yang ( National Taiwan University , Taipei , Taiwan ) , and CL1 - 5 was established by selection of increasingly invasive cell populations from CL1 - 0 24 . Bm7BrM was derived from F4 with specific brain metastasis 25 . BEAS - 2B , H1299 , and F4 were cultured in DMEM / F - 12 media ( Invitrogen ) . A549 , CL1 - 0 , and Bm7BrM were maintained in RPMI 1640 media ( Invitrogen ) , and H2981 were maintained in DMEM media ( Invitrogen ) . All culture media were supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum and 1 % antibiotics ( GIBCO ) . All cells were grown in a humidified atmosphere of 5 % CO 2 and 95 % air at 37 °C . Tissue specimens . This study protocol ( CMUH103 - REC1 - 140 ) was approved by the Regional Ethical Committee and the Institutional Review Board of China Medical University Hospital ( Taichung , Taiwan ) accord - ing to the guidelines of the Helsinki Convention . Tissue specimens without linkage of personal privacy were obtained from patients with stage I lung adenocarcinoma who underwent pulmonary resection at China Medical University Hospital from Jan 2008 to Mar 2010 . The specimens from patients who received neoadjuvant chemo - therapy were excluded . A total of 50 samples were divided into two groups based on postsurgical recurrence : ( 1 ) recurrence group : samples from patients suffering from recurrence within 5 - year of surgery ( N = 18 ) , and ( 2 ) non - recurrence group : samples from patients without recurrence within 5 - year of surgery ( N = 32 ) . Several demographic , clinical and biochemical variables , such as age , gender , pathologic stage , tumor location , differenti - ation , smoking status , EGFR mutation , and EFHD2 expression were evaluated for the consideration of recurrence ( Table 1 ) . For EGFR mutation determination , tumor DNA extracted from paraffin blocks was subjected to PCR amplification and sequence analysis of the EGFR gene at exons 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , and 22 26 . Mass spectrometric analysis . Membrane proteins were extracted using compartmental protein extraction kits CNM ( BioChain Institute ) , which utilized chemicals to separate and purify cytoplasmic proteins , nuclear proteins , and membrane proteins individually . The membrane proteins were further separated by SDS - PAGE and divided into ten gel fractions . Each gel fragment was subjected to in - gel trypsin digestion , and then the tryptic peptides were injected into the linear ion trap - Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer ( LTQ - FTICR MS ) ( Thermo Electron ) for mass analysis . The survey scan ( m / z range : 320 – 2 , 000 ) was performed in FTICR MS with a mass resolution of 100 , 000 at m / z 400 . The top ten most abundant multiply charged ions were sequentially isolated for MS / MS assay by LTQ . MaxQuant 27 and MaxLFQ 28 softwares were used for protein identification and label - free quantitative analysis , respectively . The significance threshold for the identification was set as P < 0 . 01 . www . nature . com / scientificreports / 3 SCIeNTIfIC RepoRts | 7 : 14617 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41598 - 017 - 15186 - y Western blot analysis .

The data are displayed as the means ± SD and categorical data are presented as fre - quencies and proportions . The significance of differences was examined by Student’s t - test for continuous varia - bles as well as Chi - square test or Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables as appropriate . Overall survival and disease - free survival were determined by the Kaplan - Meier method and compared with using the log - rank test . Multivariable analysis of the independent factors associated with disease - free survival was performed using the Cox proportional hazard model . The statistical analysis of the data was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 22 ( IBM Co . ) . P < 0 . 05 was considered statistically significant . Results EFHD2 is expressed in highly metastatic tumor cell lines . To narrow down potential targets and test our assumption that common proteins are involved in metastasis in various tumor cells , we performed compar - ative proteomic analyses to identify metastasis - related markers . Three pairs of tumor cell lines with differential metastatic abilities were compared , including lung cancer cell lines CL1 - 0 and F4 ( isogenic lines ) , colorectal cancer cell lines SW480 and SW620 ( isogenic lines ) , and esophageal cancer cell lines CE81T and CE146T . The identified proteins with greater than 4 - fold expression in highly metastatic tumor cell lines were further analyzed using a Venn diagram . The result revealed that only EF - hand domain - containing protein D2 ( EFHD2 ) exhibited high expression in all highly metastatic tumor cell lines ( Fig . 1A ) . Western blot validation revealed that EFHD2 was expressed at higher levels in tumor cells with more metastatic ability compared with those with less metastatic ability ( Fig . 1B ) . To determine whether EFHD2 expression is correlated with the metastatic ability in lung tumor cells , we determined EFHD2 protein levels and invasive cell number using Western blot and transwell assays , respectively , in A549 , CL1 - 0 , F4 , H2981 , and H1299 cells . F4 and H1299 expressed increased endogenous levels of EFHD2 and exhibited an increased invasive ability compared with A549 , CL1 - 0 , and H2981 . Accordingly , a positive correlation between EFHD2 protein levels and the invasive ability in lung tumor cells was noted , and the correlation coefficient was 0 . 945 ( Fig . 1C ) . Moreover , the positive correlation was also observed in the isogenic lung tumor cell lines CL1 - 0 , F4 , and Bm7BrM ( Fig . 1D ) . These results suggest that EFHD2 expression is associ - ated with the increase of metastatic ability of lung tumor cells . EFHD2 is relevant to cancer recurrence in patients with stage I lung adenocarcinoma . To eval - uate EFHD2 expression in clinical samples , we performed IHC with an anti - EFHD2 antibody on the lung cancer tissue array BC041115a ( US Biomax ) , which contains lung normal tissue , lung squamous cell carcinoma , and adenocarcinoma . EFHD2 was undetectable in lung normal tissue ( Supplemental Fig . S2A ) . The percentages of cell expressing EFHD2 in cancer stage I , II , and IIIa were 36 . 8 % , 37 . 5 % , and 28 . 6 % , respectively , in lung squamous cell carcinoma and 41 . 2 % , 68 . 8 % , and 50 . 0 % , respectively , in lung adenocarcinoma ( Supplemental Fig . S2B ) . This analysis revealed that EFHD2 expression did not correlate with cancer malignancy . Next , we determined whether EFHD2 expression was relevant to recurrence of early - stage NSCLC . The Kaplan - Meier - plotter cancer database search 29 indicated that EFHD2 mRNA levels were significantly correlated with the overall survival and disease - free survival of stage I lung adenocarcinoma ( Fig . 2A and B ) . Moreover , we performed a retrospective Figure 1 . EFHD2 is expressed in highly metastatic tumor cells .

( B ) EFHD2 expression in the three pairs of tumor cells was determined by Western blot assay . ( C ) EFHD2 expression and the invasive ability of lung tumor cells were determined using Western blot and transwell assays , respectively .

EFHD2 levels of CL1 - 0 were used as the relative control and set as 1 .

Immunostaining revealed that EFHD2 was homogeneously expressed in cancer tissue , whereas negative signals were noted in normal tissue adjacent to lung cancer ( Fig . 3A ) . In contrast to the non - recurrent group , the most recurrent group exhibited moderate to strong EFHD2 signals ( Fig . 3B ) . It is especially noteworthy that lung adenocarcinoma without EFHD2 expression present dramatically lower recurrence ( 8 . 3 % , 2 / 24 ) in comparison with EFHD2 - positive lung adenocarcinoma ( 61 . 5 % , 16 / 26 ) ( Fig . 3B ) . The representative photographs of EFHD2 signals with negative and strong intensities are displayed in Fig . 3C . The disease - free survival was significantly worse in patient with positive EFHD2 signals ( hazard ratio [ HR ] , 6 . 14 ; 95 % CI , 2 . 40 – 15 . 74 ) in Kaplan - Meier analysis ( Fig . 3D ) . Log - rank tests revealed the disease - free survival rates were significantly different between patients who express EFHD2 and patients who do not express EFHD2 ( P < 0 . 001 ) ( Fig . 3D ) . In addition , the demographic , clinical and biochemical variables of patients were also evaluated for the Figure 2 . In silico analysis predicted that EFHD2 overexpression is correlated with poor survival in stage I lung adenocarcinoma patients . The correlation between EFHD2 mRNA levels and ( A ) overall survival or ( B ) disease - free survival of stage I lung adenocarcinoma patients was analyzed by Kaplan - Meier - plotter cancer database search .

Univariate Cox regression analysis revealed that pathologic stage , differenti - ation , and EFHD2 expression were related to disease - free survival ( Table 2 ) . Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that only pathologic stage and EFHD2 expression were independent clinical predictors of disease - free survival of patients with stage I lung adenocarcinoma ( P < 0 . 001 ) ( Table 2 ) . These data suggest that EFHD2 could serve as an independent marker to predict postsurgical recurrence of patients with stage I lung adenocarcinoma . EFHD2 promotes the metastatic abilities and epithelial - to - mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) of lung adenocarcinoma cells . To determine whether EFHD2 contributes to the metastatic abilities of lung adenocarcinoma cells , we used the pcDNA vector to overexpress EFHD2 in A549 cells ( low endogenous EFHD2 levels ; Fig . 1C ) and shRNA to knockdown EFHD2 in H1299 cells ( high endogenous EFHD2 levels ; Fig . 1C ) . EFHD2 overexpression and knockdown did not obviously affect cell growth based on MTT assays ( Supplemental Fig . S3 ) . EFHD2 overexpression significantly increased migration and invasiveness in A549 , whereas EFHD2 knockdown had the opposite effects in H1299 ( Fig . 4A and B ) . A previous study indicated that EFHD2 modulates actin bundling and F - actin structure and contributed to the formation of lamellipodia 13 , 14 , which represent an important driver during metastasis 30 . Accordingly , we examined the effect of EFHD2 on lamellipodia formation by confocal microscopy . The images demonstrated that EFHD2 increased invadopodia - like protrusive structures and the formation of invadopodia , which can be visualized by colocalization of cortactin and F - actin 31 ( Fig . 4C ) . In addition , EFHD2 - overexpressing A549 cells exhibited significantly more cells with invadopodia structure compared with control cells ( Fig . 4D ) . When tumor cells disseminate from the primary lesion to colonize distant organs , EMT is an important step during the initiation of metastasis 32 . To determine whether EFHD2 regulates the EMT program , we determined the expression of EMT - related proteins after EFHD2 overexpression or knockdown . Western blot assay indi - cated that EFHD2 knockdown decreased the expression of the mesenchymal cell marker vimentin in H1299 and H2981 cells ( Fig . 5A ) . In contrast , EFHD2 overexpression increased the expression of the mesenchymal cell marker vimentin and reduced the expression of the epithelial cell marker E - cadherin in A549 and CL1 - 0 cells ( E - cadherin is undetectable in CL1 - 0 ) ( Fig . 5B ) . In addition , EFHD2 increased the expression levels of EMT - related transcriptional factors Snail , Twist1 , ZEB1 and ZEB2 in A549 cells ( Fig . 5C ) , but EFHD2 knock - down decreased the expression of these factors ( Fig . 5D ) . Collectively , these results suggest that EFHD2 contrib - utes to the promotion of EMT and metastasis in lung adenocarcinoma cells . EFHD2 promotes the EMT through inhibition of CAV1 . To investigate the underlying mechanism of EFHD2 in regulating EMT , a comparative proteomic analysis was performed to determine the protein signa - tures affected by EFHD2 overexpression . In total , 3904 proteins were identified in EFHD2 - overexpressing and control A549 , and protein quantification was performed using label - free proteomic methods 27 , 28 . Of these , 338 proteins exhibited greater than 5 - fold overexpression , and 383 proteins exhibited less than 0 . 2 - fold expression in EFHD2 - overexpressing A549 cells compared with control cells ( Supplementary Tables 2 and 3 ) . Given that the function of EFHD2 is relevant to metastasis , we used a strategic combination search involving “the identified protein” and “metastasis” from the PubMed website to narrow down the candidates ( Supplementary Fig . S4A ) . Certain candidates were validated by Western blot assay ( Supplementary Fig . S4B ) . We noticed that caveolin - 1 ( CAV1 ) exhibited significantly decreased expression under EFHD2 overexpression conditions . EFHD2 dramat - ically suppressed CAV1 expression not only at protein levels in Western blot and confocal microscopy assays ( Fig . 6A and B ) , but also at mRNA levels in qPCR analysis ( Fig . 6C ) . To confirm whether EFHD2 regulates the EMT through inhibition of CAV1 , we performed CAV1 knockdown in parental A549 and CAV1 rescue in EFHD2 - overexpressing A549 cells . Direct CAV1 knockdown increased the expression of the mesenchymal cell marker vimentin and decreases the expression of the epithelial cell marker E - cadherin ( Fig . 6D ) . In rescue experiments , the re - expression of CAV1 partly abolished EFHD2 - induced EMT in A549 cells ( Fig . 6D ) . In addi - tion , CAV1 knockdown enhanced the expression of EMT - related transcriptional factors Twist1 , ZEB1 and ZEB2 ( Fig . 6E ) , which is similar to the effect of EFHD2 overexpression in A549 cells . Taken together , these results sug - gest that EFHD2 promotes the EMT through inhibition of CAV1 .

Disease - free survival analysis of prognostic factors in stage I lung adenocarcinoma patients by Cox regression analysis . www . nature . com / scientificreports / 7 SCIeNTIfIC RepoRts | 7 : 14617 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41598 - 017 - 15186 - y Discussion Currently , several clinical and pathologic parameters have been proposed to distinguish those patients at increased risk of recurrence , including TNM classification , the standard uptake value in positron emission tomography scanning , histological differentiation , vessel invasion , lymphatic permeation , and pleural invasion 5 , 33 . These screening parameters may benefit patients with a low risk of postsurgical recurrence from avoiding unnec - essary treatment , but whether these screening parameters improve the survival outcome of patients with a high risk of recurrence remains unknown . The use of molecular markers is an alternate method to define those patients with increased recurrence risk . Several molecular markers , such as gene mutation / deletion , DNA modification , miRNA , and alterations in protein or mRNA expression levels , are used to predict the recurrence potential in early - stage NSCLC . Of these , the gene signatures derived from comparative DNA microarray and qPCR analyses are the most widely proposed markers 34 – 36 . Due to poor reproducibility , gene markers have not applied to the clinic to date 37 . Several protein markers , including TS 38 , MACC1 39 , MIB - 1 and Bcl - 2 40 , and Ki - 67 in combination with kRAS status 41 , predict postsurgical recurrence of stage I NSCLC . However , the predictive power of these markers exhibited unsatisfactory sensitivities and specificity , thus limiting their clinical application . Recurrence of early - stage lung cancer could result from tumor cells disseminated during surgery or occult metastatic tumor cells that are undetected by standard diagnostic imaging 42 . The existence of occult metastatic tumor cells suggests that tumor cells could acquire metastatic characteristics and change their EMT feature at the primary site at a very early stage of disease . Consequently , it is possible to detect tumor cells with meta - static potential at the primary site in patients using a suitable method , such as IHC . Thus , precise prediction of recurrence at the early stage of cancer is theoretically feasible . Tissue is the most direct specimen for monitoring pathological changes in diseases , but the acquisition of tissue samples is not straightforward given the need for Figure 4 .

Surgical resection is the standard treatment for patients with early - stage lung cancer ; thus , the measurement of diagnostic parameters from tissue specimens is practical . In this study , we utilized cancer database analysis and a cohort using an IHC approach to examine the correlation between EFHD2 and cancer recurrence . Our results revealed that EFHD2 was significantly correlated with postsurgical recurrence of patients with stage I lung adenocarcinoma ( Fig . 3B ; Table 1 ) . EFHD2 measurements can detect recurrent stage I lung ade - nocarcinoma with a sensitivity of 88 . 9 % , a specificity of 68 . 8 % ( p < 0 . 001 , Chi - square test ) . Thus , EFHD2 could serve as a potential predictor for this disease . EFHD2 was first identified in the immune system 7 . Currently , EFHD2 plays an important role in the nervous system 43 , and its functions are associated with several neuropathological disorders , including Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease 10 – 12 . Until recently , EFHD2 was recognized to function in cancer metastasis . The study showed that EFHD2 overexpression induced pulmonary metastasis in highly invasive B16F10 melanoma cells , whereas its knockdown led to metastatic inhibition 15 . In the present study , we hypothesized that tumor cells use a similar mechanism to promote metastasis at a very early stage of disease and accordingly identified EFHD2 from highly metastatic tumor cell lines ( Fig . 1 ) . EFHD2 increased cell migration and invasion and promoted the EMT feature of lung adenocarcinoma cells ( Figs 4 and 5 ) , which is consistent with the previous finding 17 and confirmed the critical role of EFHD2 in cancer metastasis . A growing body of evidence indicated that the actin - binding and F - actin bundling activities of EFHD2 were important for the regulation of cell spreading and migration through modulating actin - related membrane dynamics 13 , 14 . Actin - binding sites are located in the three major domains of EFHD2 : polyA , EF - hand , and coiled - coil domain 13 . A recent structural study indicated that the F - actin bundling activity of EFHD2 depended on the structural rigidity of F - actin binding sites in the presence of Ca 2 + , and the C - terminal coiled - coil domain of EFHD2 is necessary for F - actin bundling 44 . Our confocal microscopy assay revealed that EFHD2 increased F - actin structure and the formation of lamellipodia ( Fig . 4C and D ) , which is consistent with the observation that EFHD2 enhanced metastatic abilities in lung adenocarcinoma cells . The finding of EFHD2 was based on our originally risky hypothesis ; thus , we assessed whether the hypothesis was applicable to other types of tumor cells . Based on our limited examination , we found that EFHD2 was expressed in numerous types of tumor cells with highly metastatic potential , including breast cancer , pancreatic cancer , and gastric cancer , but it is undetectable in liver tumor cells . These observations indicate that EFHD2 could contribute to the metastatic ability in a broad spectrum of cancers . Past studies demonstrated that EFHD2 was localized to the membrane raft and the cytosol in mouse cells 9 , 44 . In human lung adenocarcinoma , IHC staining revealed that the strongest signals were located in the mem - brane , whereas weaker signals were noted in the cytosol ( Fig . 3C ) . Whether EFHD2 translocates into the nucleus remains unknown due to a lack of experimental evidence . The primary sequence of EFHD2 does not possess a nuclear localization signal ( NLS ) or highly relevant sequence that is predicted to promote nuclear retention 45 . Consequently , although EFHD2 is capable of inducing the expression of multiple EMT - related transcriptional factors , such as Snail , Twist1 , ZEB1 and ZEB2 , and whether EFHD2 directly regulates these factors remains unknown . CAV1 plays a negatively regulatory role in lung cancer development 20 , 21 . Our finding demonstrated a novel CAV1 - related pathway in that EFHD2 enhanced metastatic abilities and promoted EMT partly through CAV1 inhibition ( Fig . 6 ) . EFHD2 increased the expression of early endosome antigen 1 ( EEA1 ) in lung tumor cells ( Supplementary Fig . S5 ) indicating that EFHD2 increases cellular endocytosis activity . This phenomenon is con - sistent with the previous finding that CAV1 knockdown increased endocytosis 22 , which is involved in the regu - lation of cell migration and cancer metastasis 23 . However , reduced CAV1 protein levels were observed in most tumor cells compared with adjacent normal cells ( 49 / 50 cases ) in our IHC analysis . In addition to EFHD2 , these results indicate that CAV1 could be regulated by multiple factors in pathological conditions . Given that the reduc - tion of CAV1 was not significantly correlated with postsurgical recurrence of patients with stage I lung adenocar - cinoma , CAV1 is unsuitable as a coordinated molecule to improve the predictive power of EFHD2 . Advances in diagnostic technology increase the opportunity for the early diagnosis of lung cancer ( Supplemental Fig . S6 ) , implying that the screening for early - stage disease patients with high risk of postsur - gical recurrence will be required more than ever 46 . For recurrence prevention , the administration of adjuvant platinum - based chemotherapy is currently considered the standard of care of stage II and III patients with com - pletely resected lung cancer 47 . However , whether adjuvant chemotherapy impacts patients with stages I lung cancer remains controversial 48 , and the debate may partly result from the lack of a precise method to identify patients with recurrence potential . In terms of personalized therapy , precise selection of patients is essential to avoid superfluous exposure to cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs and ensure the quality of life of patients . In the present study , we demonstrated that EFHD2 could serve as an independent marker to predict postsurgical recur - rence of patients with stage I lung adenocarcinoma . However , a relatively small population sample recruited at a single institution indicates the limitation of marker applicability . A prospective study combined with the analysis of other suitable molecular predictors or pathological factors in a large number of patients will further refine the EFHD2 marker for clinical use .
