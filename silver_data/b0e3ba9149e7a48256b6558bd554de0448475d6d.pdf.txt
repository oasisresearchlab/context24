We have found that cofilin , a 21 - kDa actin - binding protein , is a component of these rods . Antibodies directed against cofilin labeled intranuclear actin rods induced in cells treated with dimethyl sulfoxide or exposed to heat shock and also labeled cytoplasmic actin rods induced in cells incubated in specific salt buffers . Moreover , we found that these actin rods are not stained with fluorescent phalloidin derivatives at all and appear to be right - handed helices , different from straight bundles of F - actin such as stress fibers . In vitro experiments revealed that cofilin and phalloidin compete with each other for binding to F - actin . Since cofilin and phalloidin have the ability to stoichiometrically bind actin molecule in the filament in vitro , the above results seem to suggest that cofilin directly binds to actin molecule in nearly an equimolar ratio in these rods . We call these rods " actin / cofilin rods . " Cultured fibroblastic cells contain stress fibers consisting of a large number of parallel aligned actin filaments . A variety of incubating conditions are known to disorganize stress fibers and instead induce another prominent actin - containing structure , actin paracrystal - like intracellular structures called actin rods . Dimethyl sulfoxide ( Me2SO ) and heat shock induce intranuclear actin rods ( 1 - 6 ) , whereas incubation in salt buffers induces cytoplasmic rods ( 7 ) . Certain cyto - chalasins ( 8 , 9 ) , trifluorperazine ( 10 ) , A23187 ( 11 ) , forskolin ( 12 ) , and non - ionic detergents ( 7 ) also induce intranuclear and / or cytoplasmic actin rods . Although a number of actin - binding proteins have been found to be associated with stress fibers , no actin - binding protein has been identified as a component of these actin rods . Cofilin ( 13 ) is a 21 - kDa actin - binding protein that has been purified from mammalian brain ( 13 , 14 ) and kidney ( 15 ) . It exists in a wide variety of mammalian cells and tissues . Previous in vitro studies have revealed that at near neutral pH cofilin binds to F - actin in a 1 : 1 molar ratio of cofilin to actin monomer in the filament , shortens the average length of the filament , and increases the steady - state concentration of monomeric actin to a limited extent ( 13 ) . The binding of cofilin to F - actin inhibited actin - myosin interactions and blocked the binding of tropomyosin to F - actin ( 13 ) . Cofilin was able to bind to monomeric actin in a 1 : 1 molar ratio with a dissociation constant of 0 . 1 - 0 . 2 , M at pH 7 . 1 ( 16 ) . Recently , it has been demonstrated in vitro that cofilin is capable of reversibly controlling actin polymerization and depolymerization in a pH - sensitive manner ( 17 ) . Thus , cofilin appears to be an actin - binding protein distinct from other actin - binding proteins previously identified ( 18 - 21 ) . We have found that cofilin is associated with intranuclear and cytoplasmic actin rods induced in cultured cells and that these actin rods do not bind phalloidin . These results together with the finding that cofilin and phalloidin compete with each other for binding to F - actin in vitro suggest that cofilin is a major component of the actin rods . Cofilin may play an important role in reorganization of intracellular actin struc - tures in cultured cells . MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials . Fetal calf serum and Dulbecco ' s modified Ea - gle ' s medium ( DMEM ) were from GIBCO ; palmitoyl lyso - phosphatidylcholine ( lysolecithin ; [ Pam ] - l - PtdCho ) was from Sigma ; fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) - conjugated IgG fraction from goat antiserum directed against rabbit IgG or mouse IgM was from Cappel Laboratories ( Cochranville , PA ) ; mouse monoclonal antibody ( IgM ) against chicken gizzard actin was from Amersham ; penicillin G and kanamy - cin were from Meiji Seika ( Tokyo ) . Rhodamine isothiocya - nate ( RITC ) - conjugated phalloin ( 22 ) was a gift from Th . Wieland ( Max Planck Institut , Heidelberg ) . Antibodies . Rabbit antiserum against chicken gizzard actin has been described ( 7 ) . The production and affinity purifica - tion of rabbit polyclonal anticofilin antibodies will be de - scribed elsewhere . In brief , an immune serum directed against electrophoretically purified porcine brain cofilin was subjected to ammonium sulfate precipitation ; this was fol - lowed by affinity purification on a cofilin - Sepharose column . The immunoblotting analysis with the affinity - purified anti - body has shown that a variety of cultured cells , including mouse fibroblast C3H - 2K , contained a single crossreactive protein that comigrated with porcine brain cofilin on poly - acrylamide gels ( see Fig . 1 Left ) . This indicated the mono - specificity of the purified antibody . This affinity - purified antibody was used in the present study . Cell Culture . Mouse fibroblast cell line C3H - 2K was cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum , 0 . 15 % sodium bicarbonate , 100 units of penicillin G per ml , and 0 . 2 mg of kanamycin per ml . Immunofluorescence Staining . Immunofluorescence stain - ing was carried out as described ( 7 ) . Cells grown on cover - slips were fixed with 3 . 7 % formaldehyde in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) for 20 min , washed in PBS , and treated with 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 in PBS for 5 min . They were then incubated with antibodies at indicated dilutions for 30 min at 37°C . After washing in PBS , samples were incubated with Abbreviations : Me2SO , dimethyl sulfoxide ; FITC , fluorescein iso - thiocyanate ; RITC , rhodamine isothiocyanate ; Mes , 4 - morpholine - ethanesulfonic acid ; [ Pam ] - l - PtdCho , palmitoyl lysophosphatidyl - choline . 5262 The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment .

Acad . Sci . USA 84 ( 1987 ) 5263 FITC - or RITC - conjugated second antibodies for 30 min at 370C . In several cases , they were subsequently incubated with RITC - conjugated phalloin for 15 min . Formation of Actin Rods . Cytoplasmic rods were induced in mouse fibroblastic cells by an NaCl buffer solution as described ( 7 ) . Briefly , C3H - 2K cells grown on coverslips were incubated in a solution composed of 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM CaCl2 , 1 mM MgCl2 , and 10 mM 4 - morpholineethane - sulfonic acid ( Mes ) / Tris ( pH 6 . 5 ) for 90 min at 370C . Intranuclear rods were induced in C3H - 2K cells by 10 % ( vol / vol ) Me2SO or by heat treatment ( 42 - 430C for 1 hr ) as described ( 1 , 3 , 6 , 7 ) . Introduction ofPhalloin into Living Cells . RITC - conjugated phalloin was introduced into living C3H - 2K cells by treat - ment of the cells with [ Pam ] - l - PtdCho according to the method described ( 23 ) with slight modifications . Briefly , cells grown on coverslips were placed on ice and washed in a cold solution ( 0 - 20C ) consisting of 100 mM KCI , 5 mM MgCl2 , 2 mM EGTA , and 30 mM Hepes ( pH 7 . 4 ) . They were then incubated with 10 , ug of [ Pam ] - l - PtdCho per ml in the above solution and next incubated with RITC - conjugated phalloin for 5 min at room temperature . After washing with DMEM containing 10 % fetal calf serum , cells were incubated with DMEM containing 10 % fetal calf serum for 20 min at 37°C for recovery from the [ Pam ] - l - PtdCho treatment . Sedimentation Assay . Effect of phalloidin on the binding of cofilin to F - actin was examined by the sedimentation assay . F - actin ( final concentration , 3 , uM ) with or without phalloidin ( final concentration , 10 , uM ) was incubated with cofilin ( final concentration , 3 . 2 , uM ) in a solution consisting of 10 mM Pipes , 2 mM MgCl2 , 80 mM KCl , and 0 . 1 mM dithiothreitol ( pH 7 . 3 ) at 22°C for about 30 min . An aliquot ( 150 , ul ) of each solution was then centrifuged at 100 , 000 x g for 40 min . The resulting supernatant and pellet fractions were electropho - resed on NaDodSO4 / polyacrylamide gels ( 14 % acrylamide ) ( 24 ) . Gels were stained with Coomassie blue , and the inten - @ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 4 - * u - OWN . - ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ CIO sity of the stained band was determined by scanning the gels with a densitometer . Effect of cofilin binding on the binding of RITC - conjugated phalloin to F - actin was investigated as follows . F - actin ( final concentration , 1 . 6 , M ) was incubated with cofilin ( final concentration , 2 . 1 uM ) in the solution described above at 22°C for about 30 min . Because the concentration of F - actin was decreased under these condi - tions to about 0 . 5 - 0 . 6 , M by the depolymerizing action of cofilin , 0 . 5 AM F - actin alone was used as a control . An aliquot ( 140 , ul ) ofeach of these two solutions was then mixed with equal volume of 2 % glutaraldehyde solution and allowed to react with RITC - conjugated phalloin ( 0 . 1 MM ) . Then the samples were centrifuged at 250 , 000 x g for 15 min . The fluorescence intensity of the resulting supernatant fractions was measured , and the amount of RITC - conjugated phalloin bound to F - actin was calculated . The excitation wavelength was 514 nm and the emission wavelength was 575 nm . Actin was prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle by the method of Spudich and Watt ( 25 ) and was further purified by gel filtration on Sephadex G - 100 ( 13 ) . Cofilin was purified from porcine brain as described ( 17 ) . RESULTS Association of Cofilin with Cytoplasmic and Intranuclear Actin Rods in Cultured Cells . Incubation of C3H - 2K cells in a buffered isotonic NaCl solution ( 150 mM NaCl / 1 mM CaCl2 / 1 mM MgCI2 / 10 mM Mes / Tris , pH 6 . 5 ) disorganized stress fibers and instead induced formation of cytoplasmic rod - shaped structures that were stained with antiactin anti - body ( Fig . 1 Right b and d ) , as reported ( 7 ) . In the present study , we found that the anticofilin antibody ( see Fig . 1 Left ) strongly stains these rods . When C3H - 2K cells were incu - bated at 37°C for 90 min in the above NaCl solution , the normal diffuse distribution of cofilin disappeared and instead rod - like structures consisting of cofilin formed ( Fig . 1 Right qw - . . L 4e _ am I - l AAWr . - a C . I FIG . 1 . ( Left ) Specificity of the anticofilin antibody . Duplicate samples of the total lysates from C3H - 2K cells were electrophoresed on NaDodSO4 / polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose sheets . One sample was stained with amido black ( left lane ) , and the other was allowed to react with anticofilin antibody [ diluted 1 : 10 with a solution consisting of 20 mM Tris HCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 500 mM NaCi , and 1 % gelatin ] ( right lane ) . ( Right ) Association of cofilin with cytoplasmic and intranuclear actin rods . C3H - 2K cells were grown on coverslips ( a and b ) . Cytoplasmic rods were formed by incubation of the cells with a NaCl buffer solution as described in the text ( c and d ) . Intranuclear actin rods were induced in C3H - 2K cells by incubation with 10 % ( vol / vol ) Me2SO for 60 min at 37°C ( e and f ) . The cells were fixed and stained with rabbit antibody against cofilin ( diluted 1 : 10 with PBS ) ( a , c , and e ) , with rabbit antibody against actin ( b and f ) , or with mouse monoclonal antibody against actin ( d ) . Then the cells were incubated with FITC - conjugated second antibody ( a - c , e , and f ) or with RITC - conjugated second antibody ( d ) . The same cell is shown in c and d for double staining with anticofilin antibody and antiactin antibody , respectively . ( Bar = 50 , um . ) Cell Biology : Nishida et al . D o w n l oaded b y g ue s t on J u l y 10 , 2020 Proc . Natl . Acad . Sci . USA 84 ( 1987 ) a and c ) . Double immunofluorescence staining with the antiactin antibody and anticofilin antibody clearly showed the coexistence of these two proteins in the rods ( Fig . 1 Right c and d ) . The intranuclear rods induced by Me2SO ( 2 , 3 , 11 ) were also stained with the anticofilin antibody ( Fig . 1 Right e and f ) . An immunofluorescence study using anticofilin antibody also showed that normal distribution of cofilin disappeared after heat shock at 42 - 430C for 60 min and instead bright staining appeared in the nuclei , mostly forming rod structures ( Fig . 2 ) . This indicates that cofilin , concomitant with actin , moved into nuclei as a result of the exposure of C3H - 2K cells to Me2SO or high temperatures . We have observed that antibodies against other cytoskeletal proteins , including a - actinin , filamin , vinculin , myosin , tropomyosin , vimentin , and tubulin , do not stain the cytoplasmic or intranuclear rods ( data not shown ) . We hereby call these rods " actin / cofilin rods . " Inability of Actin / Cofilin Rods to Bind Phalloidin . Phal - loidins bind to F - actin but not to monomeric actin ( 22 ) . We have found that actin / cofilin rods are not stained with any of the fluorescent phalloidin derivatives examined , N - [ 7 - nitrobenz - 2 - oxa - 1 , 3 - diazol - 4 - yl ] phallacidin , FITC - conjugat - ed phalloin , or RITC - conjugated phalloin . Fig . 3 a and b shows that stress fibers that consist of F - actin were stained with antiactin antibody and RITC - conjugated phalloin . In contrast , neither cytoplasmic actin / cofilin rods nor intranu - FIG . 2 . Immunofluorescence staining of heat - treated C3H - 2K cells . Cells were incubated at 420C for 45 min and then stained with anticofilin antibody ( a and b ) or antiactin antibody ( c ) . In the heat - treated cells cofifin was concentrated into nuclei ( a and b ) and in about two - thirds of these cells intranuclear actin / cofilin rods were formed under the conditions used ( b and c ) . ( Bar = 50 Am . ) clear rods were stained with phalloin , whereas they were both stained with antiactin antibody ( Fig . 3 c - f ) . It should be noted that after induction of actin / cofilin rods some stress fibers remained . These fibers were clearly stained with phalloin ( Fig . 3 d and f ) , but they were invisible when stained with antiactin antibody ( Fig . 3 c and e ) , because the labeling of these fibers with the antibody was much fainter than that of actin / cofilin rods . RITC - conjugated phalloin was allowed to permeate [ Pam ] - l - PtdCho - treated C3H - 2K cells after which the cells were incubated in the buffered NaCl solution or with Me2SO . The cells were further labeled with antiactin antibody and FITC - conjugated second antibody by the conventional indirect immunofluorescence method . When the incubation for in - duction of actin / cofilin rods was omitted , stress fibers were stained with RITC - conjugated phalloin and with antiactin antibody . However , when the rods were induced , these actin - containing structures were found free from RITC - conjugated phalloin ( data not shown ) . These results clearly indicate that phalloidin does not inhibit the formation of actin / cofilin rods and is released from actin filaments during formation of the rods . Mg2 + - induced actin paracrystals formed in vitro were found to bind phalloidin derivatives ( data not shown ) , suggesting that actin / cofilin rods differ structurally from such paracrystals consisting of F - actin . Cofilin and Phalloidin Compete with Each Other for Binding to F - Actin in Vitro . When F - actin was allowed to react with approximately an equimolar amount of cofilin , partial depol - ymerization of F - actin occurred and cofilin bound to the remaining F - actin stoichiometrically ( ref . 13 ; Fig . 4A ) . In contrast , when F - actin preincubated with phalloidin was allowed to react with cofilin , no depolymerization occurred and the amount of cofilin bound to F - actin was greatly decreased ( Fig . 4A ) . This indicates that phallQidin inhibits the binding of cofilin to F - actin . Fig . 4B shows the effect of cofilin on the binding of RITC - conjugated phalloin to F - actin . Cofilin - F - actin complex was fixed with glutaraldehyde as described in Materials and Methods and then allowed to react with a substoichiometric concentration of RITC - con - jugated phalloin . Almost no RITC - conjugated phalloin bound to the cofilin - F - actin complex , whereas > 80 % of the added RITC - conjugated phalloin bound to the bare F - actin fixed with glutaraldehyde ( Fig . 4B ) . These results clearly indicated that cofilin and phalloidin compete with each other for binding to F - actin in vitro . No labeling with phalloidin of actin / cofilin rods in cultured cells would be ascribed to this inhibition . Actin / Cofilin Rods Are Right - Handed Helices . Cytoplasmic ( Fig . 5 ) and intranuclear ( data not shown ) actin / cofilin rods were periodically stained when the cells containing rods were labeled with sufficiently low concentrations of antiactin antibody and FITC - labeled second antibody . We examined the specimens by lowering the specimen stage of the fluo - rescence microscope discontinuously to observe changes of the images . This procedure has been successfully applied to the determination of the helical handedness of bacterial flagella ( 26 , 27 ) . We found that actin / cofilin rods are of right - handed helical structures with the pitch of about 1 Am ( Fig . 5 ) . Essentially the same results were obtained from anticofilin antibody staining experiments ( data not shown ) . DISCUSSION This study has shown that cofilin is associated with cyto - plasmic actin rods induced by treatment with a NaCl buffer solution and with intranuclear actin rods induced with Me2SO or by heat shock . So far as examined , actin rods induced by any means contained cofilin , irrespective of the location of the rods ( unpublished observation ) . The concentration of cofflin in the rods is as prominent as is that of actin , and no 5264 Cell Biology : Nishida et al . D o w n l oaded b y g ue s t on J u l y 10 , 2020 Proc . Natl . Acad . Sci . USA 84 ( 1987 ) 5265 FIG . 3 . Actin / cofilin rods do not bind phalloidin . C3H - 2K cells were grown on coverslips ( a and b ) . Cytoplasmic ( c and d ) and intranuclear ( e and f ) rods were formed by incubation with a NaCI buffer solution and Me2SO , respectively . The cells were fixed , permeabilized , and stained with antiactin antibody ; this was followed by incubation with FITC - conjugated second antibody ( a , c , and e ) . The cells were then incubated with RITC - conjugated phalloin ( b , d , and f ) . ( Bar = 50 Aum . ) other components have been detected in the rods . We hereby call these rods actin / cofilin rods . In addition , we have detected an important feature of actin / cofilin rods - that is , phalloidin derivatives do not bind to the rods . This does not imply , however , that the rods consist primarily of monomeric actin and do not contain filamentous actin , because heavy meromyosin or the S - 1 fragment of myosin has been shown to decorate the rods ( 1 , 3 , 9 ) . To explain the inhibition of phalloidin binding to actin / cofilin rods , we took the following observations into account . ( i ) When phalloidin was introduced into living C3H - 2K cells , which were subsequently incubated in a NaCl A B 0 . 0 * 0 O . a a . 0 0 c O 06c CO Co0 a * C0 a C IL 2 Lm buffer solution , phalloidin did not inhibit the formation of actin / cofilin rods . In these cells , phalloidin did not appear to be associated with the rods . This result indicates that actin / cofilin rods might be formed from intracellular mono - meric actin molecules or , alternatively , that the breakdown of the F - actin of stress fibers may occur , which can cause release of phalloidin . The latter is more likely because the majority of stress fibers were disintegrated within a relatively short period under the conditions for induction of actin / cofilin rods and because the experiment of Sanger et al . ( 3 ) , using labeled actin , has indicated that actin released from the stress fibers by Me2SO treatment moves to the nucleus to form the rods . Whether or not the depolymerization of the F - actin of the stress fibers is induced by the direct action of cofilin under the conditions for the induction of actin / cofilin rods remains to be resolved . ( ii ) Cofilin inhibited binding of C 0 a C 0 a b a b FIG . 4 . Cofilin and phalloidin compete with each other for binding to F - actin in vitro . ( A ) Effect of phalloidin on the binding of cofilin to F - actin . F - actin ( 3 . 0 , uM ) in the absence ( a ) or presence ( b ) of phalloidin ( 10 , uM ) was allowed to react with cofilin ( 3 . 2 , gM ) . The open bar and closed bar represent concentrations of remaining F - actin and cofilin bound to F - actin , respectively . ( B ) Effect ofcofilin on the binding of RITC - conjugated phalloin to F - actin . RITC - conjugated phalloin was allowed to react with glutaraldehyde - fixed F - actin ( a ) or F - actin - cofilin complex ( b ) . The percentage of bound phalloin is shown . FIG . 5 . Actin / cofilin rods are right - handed helices . A cytoplas - mic actin / cofilin rod induced by NaCl buffer solution was stained with a lower concentration of antiactin antibody ( 1 : 500 dilution ) than usual ( 1 : 50 dilution ) ; this was followed by incubation with a lower concentration of FITC - conjugated second antibody ( 1 : 200 dilution ) than usual ( 1 : 50 dilution ) . The specimen stage of the microscope was successively lowered to obtain a - c . Thus , a , b , and c indicate the cross - sectional image of the bottom , middle , and top of the rod , respectively . ( Bar = 1 gm . ) Cell Biology : Nishida et al . D o w n l oaded b y g ue s t on J u l y 10 , 2020 Proc . Natl . Acad . Sci . USA 84 ( 1987 ) fluorescent phalloidin to F - actin in vitro ( Fig . 4B ) . Converse - ly , binding of phalloidin to F - actin inhibited binding of cofilin to F - actin and thereby protected F - actin from depolymeri - zation that could be otherwise induced by cofilin ( Fig . 4A ) . Therefore , cofilin and phalloidin compete with each other for binding to F - actin . These results suggest that cofilin inter - feres with the binding of phalloidin to actin / cofilin rods by blocking the binding site of the agent on F - actin . However , we could not exclude the possibility that cofilin induces a conformational change in actin ( 13 ) , which might result in a loss of the binding site for phalloidin . Irrespective of the molecular mechanism of the inhibition of phalloidin binding to actin / cofilin rods by cofilin , the present finding suggests that in the actin / cofilin rods cofilin directly binds to actin molecule in nearly an equimolar ratio , because cofilin and phalloidin have the ability to stoichiometrically bind actin molecules in the filament . Another distinctive feature of actin / cofilin rods was also shown by immunofluorescence staining with antiactin or anticofilin antibody . Actin / cofilin rods are helices with a periodicity of 1 , um . This does not contradict the results obtained by electron microscopic studies using thin sections of cells containing the rods ( 1 , 3 , 9 , 11 ) . We have failed to preserve actin / cofilin rods in cell lysates probably because of their high lability . For this reason , ultrastructural investiga - tions on the rods have not been performed . Since incubation of actin / cofilin mixtures under various conditions in vitro never caused formation of these rod - like structures , intra - cellular actin / cofilin rods may contain another component ( s ) that is necessary for induction of the rods . The nucleophilic property of cofilin seen in Me2SO - or heat - treated C3H - 2K cells is striking ( Figs . 1 Right and 2 ) . Almost no fluorescent staining with anticofilin antibody was detected in the cytoplasm of Me2SO - or heat - treated cells , indicating that most cofilin molecules were translocated into nuclei . By contrast , labeling with antiactin antibody or fluorescent phalloidin of the same cells revealed that a considerable amount of actin still remained in the cytoplasm of cells containing intranuclear actin / cofilin rods ( ref . 6 ; Fig . 3 ) . A molar ratio of cofilin to monomeric or oligomeric actin in cultured C3H - 2K cells is significantly lower than 1 . 0 ( unpublished observation ) . Thus , the amount of actin trans - located into the nuclei of Me2SO - or heat - treated cells may be regulated by cofilin . In summary , our results suggest that cofilin is involved in reorganization of cellular actin structures leading to forma - tion of actin / cofilin rods . Because of its wide distribution in various tissues and of its intriguing properties , cofilin seems to bear a unique function in regulating cytoskeletal structures of various types of cells .
