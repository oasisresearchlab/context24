ONCOLOGY LETTERS 15 : 250 - 256 , 2018 250 Abstract . Multidrug resistance ( MDR ) is a major challenge for the management of the majority of cancers . The precise molec - ular mechanisms of MDR remain elusive . In a previous study , a multidrug resistant osteosarcoma model [ MG63 / vincristine ( VCR ) ] was established by intermittent exposure of MG63 cells to gradually increasing concentrations of VCR . These cells exhibited cross - resistance to multiple structurally and mechanistically unrelated chemotherapeutic agents . The development of MDR was associated with increased expres - sion of LIM kinase 1 ( LIMK1 ) . Compared with that in normal human fetal osteoblasts ( hFOB ) 1 . 19 , the messenger RNA and protein expression of LIMK1 was signiﬁcantly elevated both in MG63 and U2OS osteosarcoma cells . To observe the expression pattern of LIMK1 in osteosarcoma , immunohisto - chemical analyses were performed on specimens derived from 6 patients . The results indicated that LIMK1 was expressed to a greater extent in the tumor parenchyma than in the mesenchyme . The role of LIMK1 in MDR was confirmed by transfecting plasmids coding LIMK1 - small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) , wild - type - LIMK1 or empty vector into MG63 / VCR cells , and measuring the expression of LIMK1 and multidrug resistance protein 1 ( MDR1 ) , also known as P - gycoprotein ( P - gp ) . The results demonstrated that the level of MDR1 / P - gp was positively correlated with the level of LIMK1 . This correlation was also shown with the doxorubicin efflux assay and by measuring apoptosis . Speciﬁcally , after 6 h of incubation with VCR , 25 . 6 % of the cells transfected with the LIMK1 - siRNA plasmid were apoptotic compared with 6 . 2 % in the empty vector group and 1 . 3 % in the group of cells transfected with the wild - type - LIMK1 plasmid . Thus , it was concluded that LIMK1 serves a key role in the MDR of osteosarcoma and functions through MDR1 . Introduction Osteosarcoma is a highly malignant bone tumor with wide - spread histological heterogeneity , a lack of biomarkers , high local aggressiveness and a rapid metastasizing potential ( 1 ) . Osteosarcoma is the most common primary bone malignancy and the third most common cancer in adolescents and young adults ( 2 ) . Chemotherapy combined with surgery is the prin - cipal mode of treatment for osteosarcoma . However , tumor resistance to chemotherapy and molecularly targeted therapies limits their effectiveness ( 1 , 3 ) . Tumor cells may become cross - resistant to a broad spectrum of chemotherapeutic agents with different mechanisms and structures following a single - drug treatment ; this is known as multidrug resistance ( MDR ) ( 4 ) . Within tumor cells , various MDR mechanisms can operate , including increased drug efflux , mutations of the drug target , enhanced repair of DNA damage , activation of alterna - tive signaling pathways and evasion of cell death ( 3 ) . Although the precise mechanisms of MDR remain unclear , several cell membrane transporter proteins are linked to the resistance observed with commonly used chemotherapeutic agents . For example , multidrug resistance protein 1 ( MDR1 ) , also known as P - glycoprotein ( P - gp ) , belongs to the ATP - binding cassette ( ABC ) transporter family , and regulates the efflux of multiple structurally and mechanistically unrelated chemotherapeutic agents across the plasma membrane ( 3 ) . LIM kinase 1 ( LIMK1 ) is a member of the serine / threo - nine protein kinase family . It is activated when the Thr508 residue is phosphorylated by Rho - GTPases such as Rho , Rac and cell division cycle 42 ( 5 , 6 ) . LIMK1 functions through regulating actin cytoskeleton remodeling by phosphorylating and inactivating coﬁlin on the Ser3 residue ( 7 , 8 ) . Increasing evidence suggests that LIMK1 serves an important role in LIM kinase 1 serves an important role in the multidrug resistance of osteosarcoma cells JIAN - ZENG YANG 1 , 2 , LI - HONG HUANG 3 , RUI CHEN 1 , LING - JIE MENG 1 , YI - YAO GAO 1 , QIU - YE JI 1 and YAN WANG 1 1 Scientiﬁc Research Center , China‑Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University , Changchun , Jilin 130033 ; 2 Department of Nuclear Medicine , First Afﬁliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University , Zhengzhou , Henan 450052 ; 3 Department of Physiology and Medicine , China - Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University , Changchun , Jilin 130033 , P .

However , few studies have addressed the role of LIMK1 in MDR in tumor cells ( 10 ) . In a previous study , an osteosarcoma MDR model was estab - lished by using the human osteosarcoma cell line MG63 and vincristine ( VCR ) , a drug commonly used in the treatment of osteosarcoma ( 11 ) . Notably , the development of MDR was associated with increased expression of LIMK1 . Therefore , the current study was designed to determine whether the over - expression of LIMK1 contributes to MDR and to identify its potential mechanism . Materials and methods Cells and cell culture . The human osteosarcoma cell lines U2OS and MG63 ( purchased from the Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology , Chinese Academy of Sciences , Shanghai , China ) were cultured in high glucose‑Dulbecco ' s modiﬁed Eagle ' s medium ( H‑DMEM ; Gibco ; Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc , Inc . , Waltham , MA , USA ) containing 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ; Hyclone , Logan , UT , USA ) . Human fetal osteoblastic ( hFOB ) 1 . 19 cells ( donated by the Pathology Laboratory of Jilin University , Changchun , China ) were cultured in DMEM‑F12 ( Gibco ; Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc , Inc . ) supple - mented with 10 % FCS . All three cell types were incubated at 37˚C in a humidiﬁed atmosphere containing 5 % CO 2 . Tumor samples from 6 patients with osteosarcoma were collected intra‑operatively and stored at ‑80˚C ( March 2015 form the China - Japan Union Hospital of Jilan University , Changchun , China ) . Written consent was obtained from all patients or their families , and the study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki . The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Jilin University . Establishment of VCR‑resistant cell sublines . To generate VCR - resistant sublines , MG63 cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of VCR as described previously ( 11 ) . Briefly , parental MG63 cells were cultured initially in H - DMEM containing 10 ng / ml VCR ( Shanghai New Hualian Pharmaceutical Co . , Ltd . , Shanghai , China ) for 72 h . Surviving cells were collected and cultured in VCR - free medium for 1 - 2 weeks , and then further cultured with VCR - containing H‑DMEM . This procedure was repeated ≥5 times until the majority of cells survived in the drug - containing medium . Cells were then exposed to increasing concentrations ( 10 - 500 ng / ml ) of VCR following the same procedure . This process required 4 - 6 weeks to establish adequate growth at each VCR concentration . Eventually , a subline resistant to 500 ng / ml VCR was obtained , which was named MG63 / VCR . Prior to each experiment , MG63 and MG63 / VCR cells were maintained in drug‑free media and subcultured ≥3 times . Drug sensitivity assays . The Cell Counting kit - 8 ( CCK - 8 ) ( Dojindo Molecular Technologies , Inc . , Kumamoto , Japan ) assay was used to determine the sensitivities of cells to VCR , pirarubicin ( THP ) , methotrexate ( MTX ) , doxorubicin ( DOX ) ( all from Hualian Pharmaceutical Co . , Shanghai , China ) and paclitaxel ( PTX ) ( Laboratories Pierre Fabre , Castres , Cedex , France ) . Cells in the logarithmic growth phase were trypsin - ized and plated onto 96 - well plates at 8x10 3 cells / well , and cultured for 24 h in 100 µl H - DMEM supplemented with 10 % FBS ( Hyclone ) . The culture medium was then replaced with medium containing serial dilutions of each drug ( 125 , 25 , 5 , 1 , 0 . 2 , 0 . 04 , 0 . 008 and 0 . 0016 µg / ml ) . Drug - free medium was added to the control and blank wells . After 48 h , the medium was replaced with 10 % CCK‑8 . After incubation at 37˚C for 2 h , the plates were analyzed in a plate reader at 450 nm . The percentage of inhibition for each treatment was calculated using the following formula : Inhibition = ( OD control - OD experimental group ) / OD control x100 . Based on this information , the 50 % inhibi - tory concentration ( IC 50 ) was calculated using GraphPad Prism 5 software ( GraphPad Software , Inc . , La Jolla , CA , USA ) . The resistance index ( RI ) was calculated as IC 50 MG63 / VCR / IC 50 MG63 . Immunohistochemical staining . Immunohistochemical staining was performed as described previously ( 12 ) . Briefly , tumor tissue sections were incubated with 3 % H 2 O 2 to inacti - vate endogenous peroxidases , followed by deparafﬁnization and rehydration . The antigen was released with 3 % proteinase K , followed by washing with PBS and blocking with 10 % goat serum ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Inc . ) for 1 h at room temperature . The sections were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a mouse monoclonal antibody targeting β - actin ( sc - 58673 , dilution 1 : 500 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Inc . , Dallas , TX , USA ) or a rabbit polyclonal antibody targeting LIMK1 ( sc - 48346 , dilution 1 : 100 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Inc . ) . Biotinylated rabbit anti - mouse immunoglobulin ( sc - 2359 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Inc . ) diluted 1 : 100 in 3 % normal goat serum ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Inc . ) was applied for 1 h at room temperature , followed by incubation with a horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) - conjugated streptavidin - biotin complex ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Inc . ) for 10 min at room temperature . Parafﬁn‑embedded sections were dehydrated , mounted with neutral gum and observed under a light microscope ( Olympus Corporation , Tokyo , Japan ) . Immunoprecipitation and western blot analysis . U2OS , MG63 and hFOB1 . 19 cells were lysed with lysis buffer [ 150 mM NaCl , 1 % Nonidet P - 40 , 50 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) containing 20 µM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride ] at 4˚C for 30 min , and then centrifuged at 12 , 000 x g at 4˚C for 15 min . The super - natant was stored at ‑70˚C . Equal amounts of protein ( 100 ng ) , 15 µl of protein A agarose beads ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Inc . ) and 1 µl of anti - LIMK1 antibody ( sc - 48346 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Inc . ) were added to the tubes , which were rotated overnight at 4˚C . The agarose‑antibody‑antigen complexes were collected by centrifugation for 20 sec at 12 , 000 x g and 4˚C . The supernatant was removed carefully , and the complexes were washed twice with lysis buffer . The pellet was resuspended in gel - loading buffer ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Inc . ) , and the proteins were denatured by boiling for 5 min . Protein A agarose beads were removed by centrifugation at 12 , 000 x g for 20 sec at 4˚C , and the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube . The proteins ( 20 µl per lane ) were separated by cellulose acetate membrane SDS - PAGE ( 5 % acrylamide in concentration gel and 12 % in separation gel ) and analyzed by immunoblotting , as described previously ( 13 , 14 ) , using primary antibodies against LIMK1 . Immunodetection was accomplished using an HRP - conjugated goat anti - rabbit secondary antibody ( BS - 13278 , 1 : 1 , 000 ; Bioworld Technology , Inc . , St . Louis Park , MN , USA ) rotated ONCOLOGY LETTERS 15 : 250 - 256 , 2018 252 for 1 h at room temperature . The protein bands were developed with a Novex ECL Chemiluminescent Substrate Reagent kit ( Invitrogen ; Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc , Inc . ) and analyzed by ImageJ software version 1 . 44 ( National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD , USA ) . Reverse transcription‑polymerase chain reaction ( RT‑PCR ) . Total RNA from the cell lines was isolated using TRIzol reagent ( Takara Bio , Inc . , Otsu , Japan ) and quantiﬁed using a NanoDrop ND‑2000 ( NanoDrop ; Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc , Inc . , Wilmington , DE , USA ) , and reversely transcribed into cDNA using the EX Tag kit ( TaKaRa , Japan ) according to the manufacturer ' s protocols . RT - PCR was performed utilizing TaKaRa EX Taq DNA Polymerase ( Takara Bio , Inc . ) under the following conditions : Denaturation at 98˚C for 10 sec , annealing at 54‑62˚C for 30 sec and elongation at 72˚C for 1 min for 20 - 30 cycles . The PCR products were visualized by electrophoresis on a 1 . 5 % agarose gel stained with GelRed™ ( Biotium , Inc . , Freemont , CA , USA ) . Images were obtained using the Gel Doc XR + system ( Bio - Rad Laboratories , Inc . , Hercules , CA , USA ) and analyzed using Image Lab™ software version 4 . 0 ( Bio - Rad Laboratories , Inc . ) . The PCR primers used were : LIMK1 , forward 5 ' - TGA GAC AGG TGA GGT GAT GG - 3 ' and reverse 5 ' - AGG CTG AGT CTT CTC GTC CA - 3 ' ; MDR1 , forward 5 ' - ATA TCA GCA GCC CAC ATC AT - 3 ' and reverse 5 ' - GAA GCA CTG GGA TGT CCG GT - 3 ' ; and β - actin , forward 5 ' - CTG GGA CGA CAT GGA GAA AA - 3 ' and reverse 5 ' - AAG GAA GGC TGG AAG AGT GC - 3 ' . Plasmid transfections . To assess the effect of LIMK1 in the multidrug resistance , four different plasmids were trans - fected into MG63 / VCR cells using Lipofectamine™ 2000 transfection reagent ( Invitrogen ; Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc , Inc . ) according to the manufacturer ' s protocol . An expres - sion plasmid coding for wild - type LIMK1 - myc - enhanced cyan fluorescent protein ( ECFP - LIMK1 ) and a short hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) - targeting LIMK1 construct , namely pSUPER - LIMK1 - small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) ( pSUPER - LIMK1 ) , were constructed as described previ - ously ( 11 , 12 ) . The pSUPER - negative control - siRNA ( pSUPER ) vector containing a scrambled non - target sequence and an empty vector containing myc - ECFP , were used as negative controls . Transfected cells were cultured for 24 h prior to being transferred into 60 - mm dishes or 96 - well plates for subsequent experiments . DOX efflux assay . Exponentially growing cells were plated onto 60 - mm Petri dishes and incubated with 1 . 5 µM DOX for 3 h at 37˚C . Subsequently , cells were washed three times with ice - cold PBS , then centrifuged and suspended in ice - cold PBS and the mono‑dispersed cells were analyzed by a flow cytom - eter ( BD Biosciences , San Jose , CA , USA ) using an argon laser of 15 mW at 488 nm ( 15 ) . Cell fluorescence was evaluated in duplicate for each group , and all experiments were performed in triplicate . Measurement of apoptosis . MG63 / VCR cells in the expo - nential growth phase were plated onto 60 - mm Petri dishes and incubated with 500 ng / ml VCR for 6 h at 37˚C . Upon incubation , apoptosis was evaluated using fluorescein isothiocyanate - Annexin V and PI ( BD Biosciences ) according to the manufacturer ' s protocol . The analysis was performed in a flow cytometer ( BD Biosciences ) using an argon laser of 15 mW at 488 nm . Cells ( ≥10 , 000 cells / sample ) were collected and analyzed using Cell Quest software version 7 . 5 . 3 ( BD Biosciences ) . Statistical analyses . All data are expressed as means ± standard deviation . Statistical signiﬁcance was assessed by the unpaired Student ' s t - test when comparing means between two groups or one - way analysis of variance with post - hoc Dunett ' s test to compare mean values among three or more groups . Statistical analysis was conducted with GraphPad Prism version 5 . 04 for Windows ( GraphPad Software , Inc . ) . P < 0 . 05 was considered to indicate a statistically signiﬁcant difference . Results Elevated expression of LIMK1 in human osteosarcoma cells . To explore the role of LIMK1 in the progression of osteosarcoma , its expression in vitro was ﬁrst assessed . Two osteosarcoma cell lines , U2OS and MG63 , were used and compared with normal hFOB1 . 19 osteoblast cells . The expres - sion of LIMK1 messenger RNA ( mRNA ) was signiﬁcantly increased in both MG63 and U2OS cells compared with that in hFOB1 . 19 cells ( by 2 . 6 - and 4 . 2 - fold , respectively ) ( Fig . 1A ) . A similar disparity was observed in western blot assays ( P < 0 . 01 ) ( Fig . 1B ) . The expression of LIMK1 was also analyzed in human osteosarcoma tissues by immunohistochemistry . LIMK1 was highly expressed in the tumor parenchyma compared with that in the mesenchyme ( Fig . 1C ) in 83 . 3 % of the specimens derived from 6 clinical patients . The expression of β - actin was unchanged between the parenchyma and mesenchyme . These results indicated that LIMK1 was overexpressed in osteosar - coma parenchyma , and suggested that LIMK1 may affect the progression of this type of cancer . LIMK1 and MDR1 are overexpressed in multidrug resistant MG63 / VCR cells . In previous study ( 11 ) , a multidrug resistant MG63 / VCR subline was established by intermittent exposure of MG63 cells to gradually increasing VCR concentrations , as speciﬁed in the Materials and methods section . MG63 / VCR cells were less sensitive to VCR - induced cytotoxicity than parental cells ( Fig . 2A ) . The IC 50 values of MG63 and MG63 / VCR cells were 1 . 0 and 453 . 4 ng / ml , respectively . MG63 / VCR cells also exhibited cross - resistance to other structurally and mechanistically different drugs . The RI values of VCR , MTX , DOX , PTX and THP were 476 . 2 , 4 . 7 , 46 . 5 , 379 . 0 and 23 . 7 , respectively ( Fig . 2B ) . To explore the mechanism by which MG63 / VCR cells exhibited increased drug resistance , the expression of LIMK1 and MDR1 / P - gp was examined by RT - PCR and western blot analysis . The expression of LIMK1 and MDR1 mRNA was elevated in MG63 / VCR cells by 2 . 4 - and 5 . 1 - fold , respectively , compared with that in MG63 cells ( P < 0 . 01 ) ( Fig . 2C ) . A similar result was obtained in the western blot assay , with increases by 4 . 7 - and 6 . 6 - fold in LIMK1 and MDR1 protein expression , respectively ( P < 0 . 01 ) ( Fig . 2D ) . These results indicated that LIMK1 and MDR1 / P - gp may be important in the MDR of osteosarcoma . YANG et al : LIMK1 IS IMPORTANT IN THE MDR OF OSTEOSARCOMA CELLS 253 Figure 2 .

To assess whether LIMK1 was involved in the MDR of MG63 / VCR cells , LIMK1 was knocked down by transfecting these cells with pSUPER - LIMK1 plasmids coding LIMK1 shRNA target sequences . In addition , LIMK1 expression was upregulated by transfecting the cells with ECFP - LIMK1 plasmids coding wild - type LIMK1 . The viability of the transfected cells was evaluated upon treatment with a series of diluted drugs . A representative result with VCR is shown in Fig . 3A . The IC 50 values for VCR , MTX , PTX and THP were calculated and shown in Fig . 3B . Overall , cells expressing high levels of LIMK1 exhibited strong resistance to all chemothera - peutic drugs . DOX is a commonly used anticancer drug that has autofluorescence at the same wavelength as PI ( 15 ) . The concentration of DOX was evaluated in cells transfected with different plasmids . The results revealed that DOX accumula - tion was the highest in MG63 / VCR cells transfected with pSUPER - LIMK1 compared with in other groups , as evidenced by the increased DOX fluorescence intensity in these cells . This suggested that DOX efflux was downregulated along with LIMK1 . By contrast , cells transfected with the ECFP - LIMK1 plasmid exhibited an increased efflux ability and reduced sensitivity to the drugs tested ( P < 0 . 01 ) ( Fig . 3C ) . The results from the apoptosis assays were consistent with these ﬁndings . Cytometric dot - plot images of MG63 / VCR cells obtained after 6 h of incubation with the IC 50 of VCR were used to evaluate the population of apoptotic cells in the lower right quadrant of the graphs ( which corresponds to Annexin V - positive and PI - negative cells ) ( Fig . 3D ) . The apoptosis rate in cells trans - fected with the pSUPER - LIMK1 plasmid ( 25 . 6 % ) was higher than that in the empty vector group ( 6 . 2 % ) and in the cells transfected with the ECFP - LIMK1 plasmid ( 1 . 3 % ) ( P < 0 . 01 ) ( Fig . 3D ) . These results indicate that LIMK1 is important in the MDR of MG63 / VCR cells . LIMK1 functions through regulating the expression of MDR1 / P‑gp . LIMK1 and MDR1 / P - gp were expressed at higher levels in MG63 / VCR cells than in MG63 cells ( Fig . 2 ) . To explore the connection between the two genes , the expression of LIMK1 and MDR1 / P - gp was assessed in MG63 / VCR cells following transfection with LIMK1 shRNA , wild - type LIMK1 or negative control vector . The results indicated that both LIMK1 mRNA and protein expression levels were increased in MG63 / VCR cells following transfection with wild - type LIMK1 , compared with those in cells transfected with the empty vector . LIMK1 mRNA and protein expression levels were signiﬁcantly reduced in cells transfected with LIMK1 shRNA , compared with those in cells transfected with the empty vector or wild - type LIMK1 . Notably , the change in MDR1 expression was completely consistent with that in LIMK1 expression ( P < 0 . 05 ) ( Fig . 4A and B ) . Immunocytochemistry staining was performed to compare the expression of MDR1 in the same cells . The results demon - strated that MDR1 / P‑gp expression was increased signiﬁcantly in MG63 / VCR cells transfected with ECFP - LIMK1 plasmid , while transfection with LIMK1 shRNA decreased MDR1 / P - gp expression ( Fig . 4C ) . These data suggest that LIMK1 may affect MDR by regulating the expression of MDR1 / P - gp . Discussion In the present study , a novel function of LIMK1 in regulating MDR was identified . Previous studies demonstrated that Figure 3 . LIMK1 is critical for drug resistance in osteosarcoma cells . ( A ) MG63 / VCR , MG63 / VCR pSUPER - LIMK1 - transfected and MG63 / VCR ECFP - LIMK1 - transfected cells were treated with different concentrations of VCR , and the cell viability was analyzed using the Cell Counting kit - 8 assay .

YANG et al : LIMK1 IS IMPORTANT IN THE MDR OF OSTEOSARCOMA CELLS 255 LIMK1 was overexpressed and highly active in cells and tissues of certain malignant tumors , including prostate and breast cancer ( 16 , 17 ) . LIMK1 was considered to be a key molecule that stimulated malignant tumor cell invasion and metastasis , or possibly a new ‘oncogene’ ( 18 , 19 ) . However , few studies linked LIMK1 with MDR , which represents a major challenge for managing the treatment of the majority cancers ( 20 ) . In the present study , the expression of LIMK1 mRNA and protein in twohuman osteosarcoma cell lines ( MG63 and U2OS ) was markedly higher than that in hFOB cells ( Fig . 1A and B ) . Furthermore , the expression of LIMK1 in tumor parenchyma cells was signiﬁcantly higher compared with that in mesenchymal cells ( Fig . 1C ) , suggesting that LIMK1 was responsible for the genesis and development of osteosarcoma . A multidrug resistant MG63 / VCR subline was established by intermittent exposure of MG63 cells to VCR . This subline exhibited cross - resistance to other commonly used drugs to treat osteosarcoma , but which are structurally and mechanisti - cally different to VCR ( Fig . 2B ) ( 1 , 21 ) . These drugs included Figure 4 . LIMK1 functions through regulating the expression of MDR1 / P - gp .

Notably , the mRNA and protein expression levels of LIMK1 and MDR1 / P - gp were higher in MG63 / VCR cells than in MG63 cells ( Fig . 2C and D ) . Therefore , it was hypothesized that there was a correlation between LIMK1 and MDR in osteosarcoma . In order to verify this conjecture , additional experiments were conducted by upregulating and downregulating LIMK1 in MG63 / VCR cells . Downregulation of LIMK1 inhibited the efflux of DOX and decreased the MDR of these cells compared with that of the controls . In addition , the sensitivity of these cells to VCR was elevated ( Fig . 3 ) . Of note , the expression of MDR1 / P - gp , which was also increased in MG63 / VCR cells compared with that in MG63 cells , was changed in accordance with the expression of LIMK1 . MDR1 belongs to the ABC transporter family that regulates the efflux across the plasma membrane of multiple structurally and mechanistically unrelated chemotherapeutic agents ( 3 ) . MDR1 / P - gp - mediated MDR has been long considered a classical mechanism of MDR in malignant tumors , including osteosarcoma ( 3 , 20 ) . The expression of MDR1 in MG63 / VCR cells was increased signiﬁcantly in cells overexpressing LIMK1 compared with that in cells transfected with empty vector . In addition , downregulation of LIMK1 resulted in a signiﬁcant decrease in the expression of MDR1 . These results indicate that LIMK1 serves an important role in MDR through regulating the expression of MDR1 / P - gp . The RhoA / LIMK1 / cofilin signaling pathway may have certain connection with the ABC transporter family . However , understanding the precise molecular mechanism requires further investigation . In summary , the overexpression of LIMK1 increases MDR1 / P - gp expression and has major effects on the MDR of human osteosarcoma . The present study provides new insights into the function of LIMK1 and suggests that altering LIMK1 is a potential new therapeutic strategy for osteosarcoma .
