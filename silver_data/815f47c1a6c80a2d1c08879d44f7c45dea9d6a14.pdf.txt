As part of a larger projectto provide CSCW support for factory floor workers in Process bdustries [ 2 ] , electronic diaries were substituted for paper diaries . One design aid was a conception of or - gtiationd memory as “artefact mediated process” . me electronic Diary has been introduced on one production he , to support factory floor management of the paper pro - duction process . mere is now more than a year of ex ~ eri - ence wi & and My use of tie Diary .

From this basis they can or - ientatetheir actions within a wider context . It is of the na - ture of tatig out loud that the tatig is unaddrased , and does not caH for specfic responses — altiough it can evoke them . Diary entries fo ~ ow this patte ~ with the in - teresting difference that they radicaUy extend the spatio - tempod boundaries of the overhearing . me usetiess of the Diary on the factory floor led to an interest in it from SW Supervisors and Departmental Managers . Access to the Diary is now extended from the ori ~ 35 factory floor workers @ lus 2 managers ) to more than 100 people including 13 managers . CSCW literature leads us to befieve that such sharing of “dialogue” between levek , especiaUywhen sharing was not part of the original design brief , may lead to problems , an ~ or to changes in behaviour . Most communities of practice ( e . g . pohce [ 1 ] , medicrd practitioners [ 10 ] , economists [ 8 ] ) take care that inteti notes , on - the - fly records , etc . do not pass outside the community , since this can lead to a cotiict . h the pa - pe - , Diary sharing between levels has not ( yet ) led to problems . ~ is explicable in the cment situation , but there are no guarantees for the fiture . A previous publication on papetis [ 2 ] noted that there were several reasons why paper diaries were not much use ~ and workers expressed doubts about electronic dia - ries . One of the reasons was the @ din [ 7 ] principle that they wotdd create extra work without obvious benefit . An - other was doubt about who wodd see the entries . me main use of the paper diary was as a SW foreman’s Log , and as part of tie material for morning meetings . me process of defig with “c ~ enges” and “special situations” @ aper - ti workers prefer not to tak about “problems” ) involves much intuition and divination — a “feeY’for the appropri - ate action is a consequence of a long period of experience with thk machine . “ne b ~ is for the marsin the paper mill is the instinct how to run the machine and it should never be forgotten .

[ dlfiom interviewed – ibid ] A ~ et d . [ 2 ] then fited some design points for an electronic version of the diary . ~ e originrd computer based information systems had been designed for the bene - fit and use of management and were systematic ~ y defi - cient in supporting the ad hoc information needs of pro - duction workers . me systems included helpfi materird such as procedures , trends , cases , but were genefiy ~ - cuk or time consuming for crews to search me position was taken that an application ( the Diary ) shotid be de - signed Specticdy for production workem . At the least it wodd need a more appropriate structure , the ab % ty to conduct a M text search and support for the construction of “locrd categories” to support locrd organisation of rele - vant materi ~ me idea was to meet the tidin [ m princi - ple hat those keeping tie Diary shodd be the ones to bene - fit from it and rdso to remove the fear of management scrutiny . Another benefit of the redesigned elecmonicDiary wodd be that it codd be read and written from ~ erent points on the shopfloor . Workers wotid not have to wrdk round to the foreman’s box . h the even ~ this turned out to be a crucial factor in fac % tating the use of the Diary as didogue , which forms the centi theme of this paper . ORGANiSA ~ ONALMEMORY INPROCESS INDUSTHES ‘Organisatioti memory’ was not used in workplace anrdy - sis and design in process industries because it has any out - standing advantage over other avtiable concepts . It was ufied because it provided a common ground between the researchers and the workers and managers . h discussions , it was picked up and re - nsed ( adopted ) much more than other CSW ideas . Its ordinary language vagueness , its bIurring of the distinction between object and perso ~ mte - fact and process was an advantage in he free discussion of issues . hTevertheless , when it came to desi ~ the various , ofien contradictory ideas involved had to be teased out Many detitions of organisatiod memory can be found in CS ~ literature . CO * [ q suggests “record of an or - gtition that is embodied in a set of documents and arti - facts” . ti [ 12 ] offers “includes everything that is con - tained in an orgtiation that is somehow retrievable” and “co ~ ects shared and stored understandings and beliefs and forms the basis for organisational sense - making and social construction of reti ~ ’ . Walsh & Ungson [ 18 ] suggest “stored information from an organisation’s history that can be brought to bear on present decisions” , and Stein [ 17 ] “means by which knowledge from the past is brought to bear on present activities , & us resuking in higher organisa - tionrd effectiveness” . Wrdsh & Ungson [ 18 ] Wo discuss various ‘ % ti’ into which organisational memory may be dumped ( individual ; cukure ; transformation Iogics ( e . g . procedures ) ; organisational structures ; ecology ( e . g . build - ings ) , external achives ( e . g . previous employees , reports ) , to which Stein [ 17 ] add information systems . A ~ et d . [ 2 ] state that Ms conceptuafisation pro - vides the fit best constellations of concerns in the ~ , which centre on paper breaks , appropriate and timely ac - tio ~ and ( lack of avaflable ) organisational memory to help with this . ~ ey give as a working deftitiom Eve ~ thing ( whether document , artefact , ecolo ~ , lo ~ ”c , person , or qerience ) that is somehow retrievable and he ~ s with organisational seine - mating and resolving troublm . % ey emphasise that the experience or information needed is not ready - to - hand — making it present - to - hand is the achieve - ment W perspective , locates organisational memory in process rather than any specific artefac ~ was utised for Diary design . ~ is very stiar to the position taken by Bannon [ 3 ] , where the tempting retications inherent in the very concept of organisational memory are critiqued . One of their conclusions is hat “organisationd memoriesthat simply consist of some passive capturing , storage , and eventualre - playof informationwill have very limitedif any use for the practicalaccomplishmentsof ac - tivitieswithinanorganisation” We concur with this critique , and agree that process is cen - trrd . me Diary fatity to organise and reorganise informs - tion in “locrd categories” relevant to tie workers them - 1 selves is our embedded tictionafity that a ~ ows the move I ‘ . I from passive storage to active structuring . We rdso befieve , that these experiences can be generafised , and that it is pos - sl % leto define organisationrd memory as a special sort of ~ process : “artefact mediated process” . h general this means ‘ tha $ wtie organisatioml memory is essentia ~ y a context dependent procfls and activity , it implicates , co - opts , and needs materkd artefacts . More partictiarly , these artefacts t are formatted in the sense that documents are formatted 1 [ 11 ] rdthough they cetiy need not be documents . ~ ey I can be any sort of artefact provided they are ready - to - hand when needed cf .

Shift work is nom since 24 hour production is needed to re - pay investment The COSLincluding lost sales , of downtime can be $ 20 , 000 per hour — so there is a major incentive to keep the machine rurfning come what may . Machines are ody Mted for seticing during the ~ tmas brek At other times it is cheaper and more effective to wait for a breakdonq and then cw out seficing and rephcements in p @ el with otier repairs . Days are divided into three shifts . The usurd pattern ofs ~ work for each worker is 3 motig s ~ , fo ~ owed by 3 & y s ~ , fo ~ owed by 3 night shifts , fo ~ owed by 5 days off .

Speeds on otier ma - chines can be much higher . Paper breaks , the main topic of [ 2 ] , cm be correspondingly dramatic . The paper is not pa - per as it is nody know but a sludge of varying de - grees of wetness ( depending on the stage in the process ) .

A paper machine ( depending on age and design ) may incorporate up to 50 , logic and process control computers ( the latter are used extensively in fatit diagnosis by production crews ) ; it may have as many as te ~ fixed - position , on - he video cameras . , - The images are used direcfly in control , and the tapes for post mortems on particularly “chtienging” or “specia ~ sititions . Unique Each machine is configured ~ erenfly , and has its ow history of ‘ % pdates” — changes , moficatiom , ~ d improvements ( e . g . more sophisticated contiol computers , new sensors ) . This means that experience with thfi machine is critical for fluent control . Training and experience with other machines is not enough . Experience , length of serv - ice , and intuition are accordingly hifly valued by both workers and managers . Another factor that adds to the im - portance of experience and intuition is that ( as opposed to e . g . ofi refining ) the state of the production process can be , and is directiy perceived ( seeq hear ~ smel ~ tasted ) . Expe - rience and intuition resist a priori categories . Wormafity and potentird to generate “local categories” were designed into the Diary with this in mind . Some other ttings : Pape ~ management is essentitiy hierarchical , with reporting going upwards . An important l tool of management is the “rooming meeting” , where , - , . c ~ enges and ~ ecial situations are reviewe ~ production levek monitore ~ and new activity and purchases initiated . The original paper diary was an infomtion ins ~ ent for i“ morning meetings , and the electronic diary continued to ~ 1 - this role . This was one reason why the Diary diffused horn tie factory floor to management levels . I TRANSITION FROM PAPER TO ELECTRONIC DIARY The transition was based on a cooperation between the re - searchers and the process contiol professionals .

See Figs . 2 & 3 for screenshots showing overview of the diary entries ( with alternative view buttons ) and the Diary itse ~ . mere are seveti otier practical tierences between the manti and paper diaries . me entries in the manurd diary were hard to read because handwriting varies enormously . ~ e indexing in the mti diary depended on the persom Often they recorded some hea ~ es such as date and shift and some hard data such as machine speed me date ap - peared in ~ erent places and sometimes ody the shift identication was recorded Searching and combining en - tries to give different perspectives in & e paper diary was rdmost impossible . me data in paper diary was rdso much harder , including many quasi - tables of numbers and times , although this was not systematic . After starting the elec - tronic diary , most of the hard data was hived of ftothe ma - chine operator’s repoti An important observation on the comparative pa - perlelectronic entries is that people’s names appear often in the paper diary , wtie in the electronic diary they are ve ~ rare — unaddressed notes are tie norm . Another titeresting observation concerns the - ion of the app ~ cation to roles not taken into account in the design . me diary has not been substituted for other reports used in process control . Hard data is sti recorded and presented in reports from ~ erent roles . USE OF THE DIARY ml @ ection of the Diary shows its use as factual rec - ord Mthough there are many other records of stiar data , he diary is usefl because it a ~ ows salient fac - @ numencrd data to be hi ~ ghted . Salient to whom ? me answer to this question illustrates the core function of the diary in the work process . me data that is hig ~ ghted by appearing in the diary is safient to those concerned with the hour by hour and day by day operation of the dl . h gen - ed , neither we , the researchers , nor the author of tie entry can put an exact boundary on this group . It maybe those in the same SW it maybe those in adjoining s ~ ; or even distant shifts . It may include managers . And , in general , even if we knew the boundaries of the group , neither we nor the author of the entry wotid know which individual the data was sa ~ ent to . me relevant group boundary and the relevant individual are defined if and when they re - spond to , or take some other action in tie tight of the entry . For this reason the diary entries are unaddressed— and the addressing is completed by the response , not by the author . h indicates that the Diary is a vehicle for a very special type of dialogue , different from face - to - face conversation and ~ erent from ernafl exchanges where most utterances are addressed to spec % c otiers . A fairly typicrd Diary entry fo ~ ows , where the process of addressing is completed by a response from the next shift . me second entry responds to the first and completes a sti didogue . 17 . 5 . 97 morning , shl ~ foreman , fmishing : Sensor problem in PL72 . . . . .

Diary entries ( facti and comment ) are pm of a didogue , and as such are ody irn - pficifly aadressea — even the workers themselves do not have a cIear iaea of who in parti ~ they are addressing . Nevertheless , it wotid not be possible to select the stient “facts” to include or emphasise without a good idea of who constitutes the audience . This drew out attention to the precedent for this type of didogue that can be found in the work of Heath and Luff [ 9 , 13 ] as . Wg out lou ~ and “overhearing” . Basicdy , this is the phenomena where one worker @ apparently eccentic ~ y , W to herse ~ w ~ e performing her job .

She may descn % e her own actions with screens or keyboards or otier local equipment She may leave speakers open so conversations with others can be overheard Her tig - out - loua is not specificity addressed to others , but Heath and Luff suggest it is desi ~ ed to be overheard . The col - leagues who overhear may then take supportive , or collab - orativeaction without specfic ~ y being asked to do so .

At this point we can * O note that making a change to the process without recording it in the Diary is “frowned upon” i . e . the system is completely voluntary , but there is social pressure to use i ~ This may have something to do with didogue conventions . hfore Rely the social pressure arises because use of the diary does redt in smoother working Jwe - g the visi ~ they see , hear , fee ~ sme ~ and taste the machine , sensing impending problems that may be invisible to numencd monitoring or _ mefl - lance . 2 ~ was contrary to our initial ex ~ ectation — probably deriving from our f ~ ty witi ed — that produc - tion workers ~ Jould address each other through the Diary , probably by name , witi notes , de ~ of “cMenges” and requests for action and fewer paperbreaks , because tiere is competition be - tween the production hes , — and there is a bonus that de - pends on production levels . Lastiy we need to note tie difficukies of translating the Diary entries from Finnish to Engtish — which are or - thogoml languages tith neither word roots nor grammar in common . Compounding this , the entries mix abbreviation ( as mentione ~ workem do not feel ca ~ ed upon to write complete sentences ) with jargo ~ specialist technical terms , and local slang . Diary as Ovewiew JVe have seen that fiworkers’ s ~ involve 9 days on and 5 days off . It has now become normal for workers re - turning from days off to “catch up” on those days from the Diary . This did not happen with the paper diary , and is at - tributed the satience of the entries hi ~ ghted , and to the increased ease of displaying the last few daYs . The practice of gaining an “ove ~ ie > ’ ~ eems confined ~ o facto ~ floor workers , and is not fo ~ owed by managers .

A S * phenomenon wodd be the many entries regnrdiug _ ction ( nuisance , deky , irritation ) with on the Reject Carrier ( see Zat - ) . An abstract and structured ; tiew of management and computer system design regards this level of repetition as unnecessary , inefficien ~ and time wasting . A down - t ~ earth manager might look at the entries nud say tie sine . The socidy phusl % le and computer embeddable Language Action Theory [ 19 , 20 ] was de - signed precisely to avoid such unanswered requests . Re - quests skould be met with promises ( or at least with coun - ter offers or rejection ) , and promises should be monitored for completion within specific time ties . At some levek oega contrac @ schematics of project management ) these views are sensible . However , we befieve it is a rnis - tie — nnd counte ~ roductive — to try to dkcipline d work in these terms .

Against this , researchers have pointed to the layered mture of technology e . g . [ 15 ] Newer technologies are over ~ d o % and are used in addition to , but do not replace older technologies .

Completions ( where there are completions ) may be made in conversations , by workers simply seeing l that something has been done , in morning meetings , and in other ways . Discretion is what makes the ~ erence between jobs that are done by people , and tasks that can be automated or , - subject to routinised ‘cotitments’ . Discretion involves at least a sense of priority , and intuitions about what can be safely ignored or even forgotien . Complaining outloud ( i . e . in the Diary ) about the titating delays caused by the spo - radic matictioning of the Reject Carrier fits genera ~ y witi the priorities of uninterrupted maximum production . Not taking any notice of , or making a special effort to re - spond via the Diary fits with tie priorities of discretion there are other more important things to be getting on with at this moment . k brie ~ hanging entries reflect tie effectiveness ( not the inefficiency or lack of disciptie ) of the moment - to - moment management of the paper production process . Un - addressed Diary comment is a useti form of coordinatio ~ a ~ owing both discretion and completion through other me - dia Mthough a very simple artefac ~ the use of the elec - tronic Diary draws our attention to an area that has not been much investigated in CSW the role of unaddressed comment in extended spatio - tempord contexts .

It enables sets of Wogues about the same issue to be seen together . h the examples the Reject Carrier and the Pack - ing Machine are the search terms . These WO terms ( many other more obscure ones are used by workers ) are “local categories” — and are not anticipated in formal repotig : ~ , sheets . k this sense , the dirdogues are part conversation , t part organisatiod memory .

They are stiar to dirdogue in their use of humour , slang , and agrammaticd emphases ( CAPS etc . ) They differ from spoken dialogue , where ( from Conversation Analytic accounts ) tie individ - ud utterances of one person are not necessarily complete semantic entities . They may contain interjections from oth - ers which alter their original course , or they may be com - pleted by others . The completion may be agreed by the ; original speaker , even if different to the one that would have fo ~ owed witiout the other - completion . [ 5 ] . This does not appear to happen in the Diary , where most entries are complete , in the sense of being comprehensl % le on their om This is pfiy a courtesy of using a text medium . It rdso reflects the nature of tahg out lou ~ where more ~ completeness is often provided ( e . g . a question and its an - swer ) than wotid be the case in conversation . l The ovefl usefiess of the Diary is Wustrated by a mi - non ~ of entry types — hanging entries and extended dia - logues . Both Wustrate the ways in which diary use is sirni - lar to - g out loud and overhearing . The extended dia - lo ~ es Nustite the way in which ‘searcti enables the use of lod categories ( not previously anticipated ) to construct perspectives that are part conversation , part organisational memory . Together these Uustrate a mode of computer me - diated workplace coordination tiat is very ~ erent from - ” swctured or wor ~ ow modes . DIALOGUES WITH LEAW BOUNDARIES The Diary , rdthough my operationa ~ is an experimental system There were no protocols on enticement to access . & the Diary became extensively used and mentioned in : . conversatio ~ many otiers became interested and asked for access . One interesting aspect of this was that the workers using the Diary became known as the factory experts on the use of Lotus NO ~ S , since they were using the Diary dafly . Other groups with more foml systems began to request help . Diary access extended from the original 35 factory floor workers and 2 managers to more than 100 ! people including 13 managers . The tision from tie ~ original groups of factory floor workers is shown in the t fo ~ owing table . titid Period ( Operators & managers of Paper Machine 7 ) C = ReaWntd ManageAccess ; D = Wroteor Readpaperdiary kRole B : No . c D 1 Shift foreman 5 w w I Machbe , Mass , Cylinder , 20 w R ; ‘ - Roll operators tistrument ops , Elwtricians 10 w I Production Superintendent 1 M w Production Manager I 1 w R System Designer 1 M I Toti 35 workers , 2 managers , 1 IT Support I . , , I 1 . - — I Second Period ( SHST & Previous Mand Users jo ~ Leader Phf7 , Di ~ Leaders 4 IV - - Iv Automation & hiechanicd Automation & ~ managers 2 R Development Engineer , 2 w Deputy Superintendent 1 I I D & inking control room I 10 !

Foremen’s’ hd of Shift Reports , numerous statistical reports ) for rooming meetings . The Diary printout continued to M this role . Being one amongst many documents , it is not subject to any specird scrutiny . The ti - erence in content ( fa fewer statistics , more issues ) was compensated by a anotier , properly sta - tistical record of paperbreaks etc . introduced at the same time as the Diary . Another reason was function Some rn - dividti felt their work wodd benefit from the informa - tion in he Diary . One ~ curiosity . h part the diffusion happened because the Shift Supervisor had commissioned the rese ~ ch and Diary , amongst other software suppoti He was keen to show the success of the initiative by “sefig” it to other users and audiences . hTevertheless , h sort of access petision was not just cosmetic . Logs show the ~ es are open ~ frequently by individti joining hter in tie process , and not directiy wotig with the production tie . As noted earfier , CS ~ Mteratnre leads us to betieve that sharing the Diary with management cotid Iead to proh lems . Wo - remarks , complaints , reminders , etc . in - volving the use of Mod and local categories , of jargo ~ slang , and humour [ 1O ] are not fomatted to be understood ou ~ ide tie context of the work sm . ~ ey do not provide oventiew of the work to outsiders , and may even be styled to prevent it But they may appear to provide an audit - ti — and one which disadvantages the authors . The anxieties exTressed by workers at the design stage of the electronic Diary - y concern the visib ~ ty of ad hoc , free com - ments to management ( see quota in Intro ) . The ‘hanging entries’ in partictiar , with the repetition of the same issue ( e . g . tie packing machine c ~ enges ) invite the attempt to impose a more discipked Language Action type of system — which in terms of red work effectiveness wodd be counter - productive . A second danger is that managers may ( and in practice did ) request a differen ~ standardised format for the Diary . This is understandable , as they wish to use it for agenda , re - porting , or statisticrd purposes . Such an ( extema ~ y imp - osed ) standard format wodd work agains ; or prevent infotity and the use of discretion in entering salient observations with local currency . It would also contradict the design principle of “local categories” — and hence lo - cal usefiess which underpins the shopfloor popularity of the Di ~ . my , so far , does * ion not create problems ( although potential problems may lurk on the hotion ) ? There appear to be several reasons . FirsL paper production workers and managers are a speciahed and fairly tighdy tit connnu - nity of practice . There is a long induction period , and mau - agers are generafly ftiar with the day to day difficulties and & es used to avoid paperbreaks and maintain produc - tion Less social distance means less “misreading” and misunderstanding of local tem and categories . Secon & managers in practice do not write to the Diary , even though my of them do have write permissions . This may be because the Diary labek for making entries are role specfic ( See Fig . 3 ) . It is * O logica ~ as managers are not in a position to directiy observe the machines , or to add fit hand data . Several use the diaries as part of their data for “morning meetings” ( where problems and issues arising on specfic SW are discussed on a daSy basis ) . h terms of our audytic tie , managers take part in a ~ erent but related didogue using the Di ~ as a resource . There are some entries that appear to be addressed to the morning meetings ( e . g . 26 . 6 night shl ~ Proposition for inves ~ ent : z ~ thk rq”ect cam - er can ‘t be repaired , you buy a nm car - rier ) . However , in geneti , the rooming meeting dialogue has a separate purpose , different participants and rhythm from the factory floor didogue . Thirdy , the artefact has not been changed to accommodate the new audience . It wodd be here that the greatest risks tie . It is ~ cdt to imagine how hi ~ ghting and safience , ‘ - g out loud and overhearing’ — and hence use — codd survive a reformatting into pre - defied categories . Fotiy , it may be that the cuent format of the Diary ( within its community of practice ) enables it to work as a boundary object [ 16 ] , and that there are advantages in reaching a wider audience to workers as wefl as to manag - ers . CONCLUSION Organisational memory , as explored here , is neither arte - fact nor process , but artefact mediated process . The Di ~ is best understood in this way : artefact mediated process where the predominant fom is an unaddressed entry . This can be understood in terms of “tig out loud’ and “overhearing” , but extends tie spatio - temporal ambit of this face - to - face work practice . The special type of & a - Iogue constituted by unaddressed entries included “hanging 57 I i - I * . —— _ _ _ _ _ —’— . , : , - , — . . > . - —— - * entries” — those to which there is no response — and ex - tended and repetitive Mogues . This is anrdysed as a merit ratier than a defect of work process coordination Gener - tiy these forms of unaddresse ~ teti materird suggest an alternative mo ~ ~ of computer support to expficit stmc - Wed comnmnicatiom The - ion of such factory floor Mogue to otier audi - ences , such as managers , proved unproblematic in this case . NTevefieless , in geneti there are reasons to expect - ted access to such dirdogue to be problematic . Future developments of applications to support unaddressed dia - logue @ need to consider issues of boundary management care ~ y . REFERENCES 1 .
