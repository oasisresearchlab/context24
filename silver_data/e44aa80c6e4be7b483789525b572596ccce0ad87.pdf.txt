LETTERS The ground state of embryonic stem cell self - renewal Qi - Long Ying 1 , Jason Wray 2 , Jennifer Nichols 2 , Laura Batlle - Morera 2 , Bradley Doble 3 , James Woodgett 4 , Philip Cohen 5 & Austin Smith 2 In the three decades since pluripotent mouse embryonic stem ( ES ) cells were first described 1 , 2 they have been derived and maintained by using various empirical combinations of feeder cells , condi - tioned media , cytokines , growth factors , hormones , fetal calf serum , and serum extracts 1 – 7 . Consequently ES - cell self - renewal is generally considered to be dependent on multifactorial stimu - lation of dedicated transcriptional circuitries , pre - eminent among which is the activation of STAT3 by cytokines ( ref . 8 ) . Here we show , however , that extrinsic stimuli are dispensable for the derivation , propagation and pluripotency of ES cells . Self - renewal is enabled by the elimination of differentiation - inducing signal - ling from mitogen - activated protein kinase . Additional inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 consolidates biosynthetic capacity and suppresses residual differentiation . Complete bypass of cyto - kine signalling is confirmed by isolating ES cells genetically devoid of STAT3 . These findings reveal that ES cells have an innate pro - gramme for self - replication thatdoes not require extrinsic instruc - tion . This property may account for their latent tumorigenicity . The delineation of minimal requirements for self - renewal now provides a defined platform for the precise description and dissec - tion of the pluripotent state . Mouse ES cells exist in the artificial milieu of cell culture . They are derived and maintained by using a combination of the cytokine leukaemia inhibitory factor ( LIF ) to activate STAT3 and either serum or bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP ) to induce inhibitor - of - differentiation proteins 5 . Their differentiation involves autoinduc - tive stimulation of the mitogen - activated protein kinase ( ERK1 / 2 ) pathway by fibroblast growth factor - 4 ( FGF4 ) 9 , 10 . However , neither LIF nor serum / BMP block the activation of ERK ( Supplementary Information and ref . 5 ) . We proposed that the LIF and serum / BMP signals act downstream of phospho - ERK to block ES - cell com - mitment . To test this idea we used selective small - molecule inhibitors SU5402 ( ref . 11 ) and PD184352 ( ref . 12 ) to inhibit FGF receptor tyrosine kinases and the ERK cascade , respectively . We found that , in combination with LIF , either inhibitor replaces the requirement for serum / BMP and supports robust long - term ES - cell propagation ( Supplementary Information ) . Lineage commit - ment does not occur despite a reduced expression of inhibitor - of - differentiation proteins . In contrast , ES cells plated without LIF in either PD184352 or SU5402 progressively degenerate and cannot be maintained even though differentiation is suppressed . To reduce off - target side effects we tried low doses of PD184352 and SU5402 together ( PS ) . In PS we find that undifferentiated ES cells expand through multiple passages ( Fig . 1a , b ) . Differentiation is constrained , although occasional neural rosettes emerge . This result , observed with several independent ES cell lines , suggests that the minimal requirements for ES - cell self - renewal may be to deflect commitment signals emanating from FGF receptor and ERK signalling . However , apoptosis is relatively high in PS , especially immediately after pas - sage , and cells survive poorly at clonal density , which is indicative of collateral compromise to cell growth and viability . ES - cell propagation has been reported to be enhanced by an indirubin entity , 6 - bromo - indirubin - 3 9 - oxime ( BIO ) , that inhibits glycogen synthase kinase - 3 ( GSK3 ) 4 . However , indirubins are not highly selective and cross - react with cyclin - dependent kinases and other kinases 13 , 14 . We found reduced viability of ES cells in BIO with or without PS . Nevertheless we speculated that relief of GSK3 - mediated negative regulation of biosynthetic pathways might restore growth to ES cells cultured in PS . We therefore used a more selective inhibitor , CHIR99021 ( ref . 14 , 15 ) . Alone , CHIR99021 enhances sur - vival at lowcell density butalso induces non - neural differentiation . At higher densities some colonies remain morphologically undifferenti - ated but are progressively overcome by differentiation on passaging ( Fig . 1c ) . Single blockade of GSK3 therefore has pleiotropic effects , promoting non - neural differentiation , suppressing neural differenti - ation and enhancing growth capacity . Crucially , however , in a com - bination of all three inhibitors ( 3i ) the differentiation blocking effect of PS is dominant , resulting in a highly efficient expansion of undif - ferentiated colonies , even at a low cell density . Multiple ES - cell lines tested all expand continuously for many weeks in 3i . They express Oct4 , Nanog and Rex1 with minimal levels of lineage commitment markers , Sox1 or brachyury ( Fig . 1d , e ) . In 3i , ES cells expand with a doubling rate comparable to that in LIF plus serum / BMP ( Supplementary Information ) with the proportion of Oct4 – green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) - positive undifferentiated cells remaining over 90 % . As a rigorous test of the sufficiency of 3i to sustain ES - cell self - renewal , we examined the clonogenicity of isolated cells . After single - cell deposition , undifferentiated Oct4 - positive colonies develop at higher frequency than in LIF and serum or BMP ( Fig . 1f , g ) . The B27 supplement used in serum - free culture contains defined additives , in particular antioxidants and free - radical scavengers . We found that ES cells could be propagated in bulk culture in 3i medium prepared with N2 supplement only , but they did not survive at clonal density . However , in physiological oxygen ( 5 % O 2 ) clonal propaga - tion was obtained without B27 ( Fig . 1g ) . This excludes an instructive contribution from B27 components to ES - cell self - renewal , while highlighting the damage potential of non - physiological oxygen levels . When insulin was omitted we found ES cells to be more sen - sitive to FGF receptor ( FGFR ) and MAP kinase / ERK kinase ( MEK ) inhibitors . We therefore decreased their concentrations . In these conditions , with only transferrin and albumin additives , ES cells expanded , even from single cells . They remained mostly undifferenti - ated over four weeks of continuous culture ( Fig . 1h ) , although after the first passage the propagation rate declined steadily . We conclude that insulin promotes long - term growth capability but does not dic - tate the fate choice between self - renewal and lineage commitment . 1 CenterforStemCellandRegenerativeMedicine , DepartmentofCellandNeurobiology , KeckSchoolofMedicine , UniversityofSouthernCalifornia , 1501SanPabloStreet , ZNI529 , Los Angeles , California 90033 , USA . 2 Wellcome Trust Centre for Stem Cell Research , University of Cambridge , Tennis Court Road , Cambridge CB2 1QR , UK . 3 McMaster Stem Cell and Cancer Research Institute , McMaster University , 1200 Main Street West , Hamilton , Ontario L8N 3Z5 , Canada . 4 Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute , Mount Sinai Hospital , 600 UniversityAvenue , Toronto , OntarioM5G1X5 , Canada . 5 DivisionofSignalTransductionTherapyandMRCProteinPhosphorylationUnit , UniversityofDundee , DundeeDD15EH , UK . Vol 453 | 22 May 2008 | doi : 10 . 1038 / nature06968 519 Nature PublishingGroup ©2008 Finally , we used recombinant albumin to eliminate serum - derived contaminants . In combination with transferrin and insulin , this sup - ported both bulk passaging and clonal propagation ( Fig . 1g ) . To eliminate the possibility that self - renewal in 3i might reflect pre - adaptation to specific culture conditions in our laboratory , we investigated the derivation of ES cells from mouse embryos . ES cells were readily derived from blastocysts of the permissive 129 strain plated directly into 3i on gelatin - coated plastic . Expanded lines injected into blastocysts gave chimaeras and germline transmission ( Supplementary Information ) . ES cell lines were also established from the CBA strain , which is refractory to ES - cell production under standard conditions 16 . Two of these lines were injected into morulae and both yielded high - grade chimaeras and germline transmission ( Fig . 1i ) . Taken together , the above findings demonstrate that 3i liberates ES cells from requirements for exogenous factors without compromise to developmental potency . To confirm that blockade of FGF signalling is the critical target of SU5402 we substituted an alternative inhibitor , PD173074 ( ref . 17 ) . We found that this could substitute for SU5402 in 3i at 40 - fold lower concentrations , which is consistent with its higher affinity for the FGF receptor ( Fig . 2a ) . We then examined fgf4 - null ES cells 18 and determined that they can expand continuously in CHIR99021 alone ( Fig . 2b ) , providing genetic validation of the significance of autoin - ductive FGF4 . FGF4 activates the phosphatidylinositol - 3 - OH kinase / protein kinase B ( PKB ) and the Ras – MEK – ERK intracellular signalling cascades ( Fig . 2c , d ) . Phosphorylation and activation of PKB is not appreciably altered by the 3i inhibitors . PD184352 or SU5402 applied alone at the low doses used in 3i cause only modest decreases in steady - state phospho - ERK .

LETTERS NATURE | Vol 453 | 22 May 2008 520 Nature PublishingGroup ©2008 inhibitors greatly decreases phospho - ERK levels . CHIR99021 does not modulate phospho - ERK ( Fig . 2e ) . We tested erk2 - null ES cells 19 and found that these can be maintained at high density with CHIR99021 only , although optimal propagation requires supple - mentation with PD184352 ; this is consistent with maintained activity of phospho - ERK1 in these mutants . The central role of the ERK cascade was confirmed by using a structurally related , more potent but equally selective MEK inhibitor , PD0325901 ( ref . 15 ) , to achieve greater suppression of ERK activation without side effects . This is sufficient to sustain efficient ES - cell self - renewal in combination with CHIR99021 only ( Figs 1g and 2e ) . An unwarranted side effect of suppressing phospho - ERK is to depress myc messenger RNA and Myc protein levels ( Fig . 2f and Supplementary Information ) . Upregulation of c - Myc has been sug - gested to mediate ES - cell self - renewal downstream of LIF and of BIO 20 . However , the low c - Myc levels in cultures in PS are not increased by CHIR99021 or LIF ( Fig . 2f ) . Therefore elevated c - Myc is not necessary for ES - cell propagation , although some requirement for basal Myc activity is not excluded . STAT3 signalling is central to previous models of ES - cell self - renewal 8 , 21 and has also been implicated in effects of BIO 20 , 22 , 23 . In 3i , however , we do not detect activation of STAT3 or induction of its target SOCS3 ( Supplementary Information ) . To test definitively whether STAT3 is dispensable for ES - cell self - renewal , embryos from intercrosses of Stat3 heterozygous mice were cultured in 3i . Homozygous mutant ES cells were established ( Fig . 3a ) . Stat3 - null cells are morphologically indistinguishable from wild - type ES cells . They express Oct4and Nanog , and initiate multilineage commitment in embryoid bodies ( Fig . 3b – d ) . They show no induction of SOCS3 when stimulated with LIF ( Fig . 3e ) . When transferred to LIF and serum , stat3 2 / 2 cells differentiate rapidly , confirming their incom - petence to respond to LIF ( Fig . 3f ) . We conclude that the otherwise absolute requirement for STAT3 in the derivation and self - renewal of mouse ES cells is rendered dispensable by 3i . CHIR99021 induces a decrease in phosphorylation of b - catenin ( Supplementary Information ) and activation of the T - cell factor ( TCF ) - responsive TOPFlash reporter ( Fig . 4a ) , simulating canonical Wnt signalling . We investigated whether Wnt could replicate the effect of CHIR99021 . Recombinant Wnt3a alone induced non - neural differentiation , as seen with CHIR99021 only . This effect was sup - pressed by PS and at high concentrations ( 100 ng ml 2 1 ) Wnt3a seemed to eliminate residual neural differentiation and thereby improved ES - cell propagation . However , expansion in PS plus Wnt3a did not match that obtained in 3i . We introduced into ES cells dominant - negative D NhLef1 , which lacks the b - catenin - binding domain and suppresses TCF - mediated transcriptional activation . As expected , ES cells stably expressing D NhLEF1 showed reduced TOPFlash activity ( Fig . 4a ) . Nonetheless they readily formed undif - ferentiated colonies in 3i . A competitive self - renewal assay was per - formed after treatment with Cre to excise the floxed D NhLEF1 and simultaneously activate GFP . Equivalent numbers of D NhLEF1 - expressing and revertant GFP - expressing cells were propagated as mixed cultures for four passages . In serum plus LIF the GFP - positive and GFP - negative populations remained equivalent . In 3i the GFP - negative D NhLEF1 - expressing cells became marginally predominant ( Fig . 4b ) . Decreasing TCF activation therefore does not impede ES - cell self - renewal . Increased b - catenin levels might also enhance cell adhesion . However , E - cadherin - null ES cells that lack adhesion junc - tions remain undifferentiated and proliferate as rapidly in 3i as in LIF plus serum ( Supplementary Information ) . To confirm that the effect of CHIR99021 is mediated through the inhibition of GSK3 , we interrogated ES cells in which both GSK3 a and GSK3 b had been deleted 24 . These DKO cells are profoundly deficient in neural differentiation . They can be passaged two or three times in non - supplemented medium but succumb to progressive non - neural differentiation . This short - lived propagation is similar to that of wild - type ES cells cultured in CHIR99021 only ( compare Fig . 4c with Fig . 2a ) . Addition of PS or PD0325901 eliminates differ - entiation and allows continuous passaging ( Fig . 4c ) . However , expansion is slower than in wild - type cells in 3i . LIF restores normal population doubling ( Fig . 4c ) , but CHIR99021 has no beneficial effect . This confirms that the effect of CHIR99021 is mediated through GSK3 and that LIF operates through a parallel STAT3 ( refs 8 , 21 ) pathway independent of GSK3 inhibition . DKO cells show constitutive TOPFlash activation 24 , 50 - fold higher than CHIR99021 - treated wild - type cells ( Supplementary Information ) . This tonic b - catenin / TCF activity , with upregulation of targets such as brachyury and cdx1 ( ref . 24 ) , probably underlies their compro - mised propagation . ES cells constitutively expressing elevated levels of Nanog are cap - able of sustained self - renewal in N2B27 alone but expand poorly at clonal density unless LIF is also added 5 . They form only a few small colonies at low density in PS but generate abundant undifferentiated colonies in 3i ( Fig . 4e ) . The key effect of CHIR99021 therefore does not involve the induction of Nanog . Because Nanog - overexpressing ES cells are independently blocked in differentiation , this result further suggests that the contribution of GSK3 inhibition extends beyond limiting differentiation . To probe this further , we evaluated whether CHIR99021 could rescue ES cells subjected to a more pro - found blockade of phospho - ERK . A higher dose of PD0325901 ( 2 or 3 m M ) almost entirely eliminates phospho - ERK and causes growth arrest and cell death . The addition of CHIR99021 restores viability and allows efficient expansion of undifferentiated ES cells in the near absence of ERK signalling ( Fig . 4f ) .

NATURE | Vol 453 | 22 May 2008 LETTERS 521 Nature PublishingGroup ©2008 crucial to maintain metabolic activity , biosynthetic capacity and overall viability . This study reveals that the pathways required to sustain undiffer - entiated ES cells are dictated by the construction of the culture milieu . In a neutralized environment , ES cells can be efficiently derived and maintained without a requirement for growth factors or cytokines ( Fig . 4g ) . We infer that BMP / Smad / Id and LIF / STAT3 signalling do not instruct self - renewal but act in unrefined culture conditions to shield the pluripotent state from induced phospho - ERK ( Fig . 4h ) . Earlier studies have pointed to a positive effect of inhibiting the ERK cascade on ES - cell propagation in the context of additional signals 25 , 26 . However , upregulation of c - Myc , Stat3 or anti - apoptotic factors , previously invoked as key effectors of self - renewal , is not relevant in 3i . Our data do not exclude a contribution of stabilized b - catenin through TCF - independent mechanism ( s ) , possibly acting as a noise filter 27 . Wnt3a does enhance neural sup - pression in PScultures , butit givessignificantly lessbenefit for overall propagation than CHIR99021 does . We infer that the pivotal contri - bution of GSK3 inhibition is to restore full growth and viability . This may be achieved by balancing the loss of ERK input into basic cellular processes . We detected no induction of anti - apoptotic factors ( Supplementary Information ) , indicating that reduced GSK3 activity may exert a global modulation of the ES - cell metabolomic and bio - synthetic capacity rather than having a direct anti - apoptotic action . Furthermore , restoration of the biosynthetic capacity of ES cells might itself increase the threshold for commitment . This possibility is suggested by the effect of feedback in mitogen - activated protein kinase signalling circuitry on the mating switch decision in yeast 28 . Previous empirical configurations of the culture environment have obscured the critical requirements for maintaining ES - cell pluripotency . We propose that ES cells are a basal cell state that is intrinsically self - maintaining if shielded effectively from inductive differentiation stimuli including autocrine FGF4 . This feature may underlie the well - known predisposition of ES cells to generate terato - carcinomas 29 , 30 . They can dispense with an elementary cell signalling pathway , ERK , and do not seem to require any intercellular stimu - lation . They have not developed G1 cyclin checkpoint control of cell cycle progression and replicate constitutively 29 . ES cells thus display a self - sufficiency more akin to that of unicellular organisms than the interdependence generally exhibited by metazoan cells .

NATURE | Vol 453 | 22 May 2008 LETTERS 523 Nature PublishingGroup ©2008 METHODS Details of RT – PCR conditions and antibodies are provided in Supplementary Information . ES - cell culture . N2B27 medium was prepared as described 31 , 32 or with prefor - mulated NDiff N2B27 base medium ( catalogue no . SCS - SF - NB - 02 ; Stem Cell Sciences Ltd . ) Where specified , recombinant human albumin ( Cellastim ; Invitria ) was substituted for bovine serum albumin . Cells were routinely propa - gatedbytrypsinizationandreplatingeverythreedays , withasplitratioof1in10 . ES - cell derivation . Whole diapause blastocysts ( strain 129 ) or isolated epiblasts ( CBA ) were plated in pre - equilibrated N2B27 3i medium . After several days , cell masses were disaggregated into small clumps of cells with trypsin and replated . Emerging ES - cell colonies were expanded by replating into successively larger wells . Wild - type MF1 ES cells were derived from whole blastocysts as for strain 129 . These cells showed decreased substrate attachment , probably as a result of the outbred MF1 genetic background . They can be passaged on laminin - coated plastic but are more readily maintained on murine embryo fibroblast feeders . Accordingly , for Stat3 mutant derivations we employed feeders for part of the process . Eight - cell embryos from intercrosses of Stat3 1 / 2 outbred MF1 mice 33 were cultured in KSOM medium containing 3i until the formation of expanded blastocysts . Trophectoderm layers were removed by immunosurgery and ana - lysed by PCR for genotype determination 34 . Four isolated inner - cell masses ( three Stat3 1 / 2 , one Stat3 2 / 2 ) were plated individually into four - well plates on feeders in pre - equilibrated N2B27 3i . After five days , cell masses were dis - aggregated with trypsin and plated into fresh four - well plates . ES cells developed in all four cultures and were expanded in laminin - coated wells without feeders . Transfections . D NhLef1 ( ref . 35 ) was inserted between loxP sites in pPyFloxedMTIPgfp 36 . This construct was transfected by electroporation into E14Tg2a ES cells for stable integration , or into E14T ES cells 36 for episomal propagation . Dual luciferase reporter assays were performed 56h after lipofec - tion with TOPFlash or FOPFlash constructs . Competitive self - renewal assay . Three clones of E14Tg2a stable transfectants were transiently transfected with a Cre expression vector to excise D NhLef1 and simultaneously activate GFP expression . After 24h , GFP - positive and GFP - negative cells were fractionated by fluorescence - activated cell sorting ( FACS ) , recombinedin equal numbersand plated in six - wellplates at 10 5 cells per well in N2B27with3i .
