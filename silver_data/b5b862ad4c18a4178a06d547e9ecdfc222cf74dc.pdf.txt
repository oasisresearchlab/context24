The Use of Group Judgments in Belief Revision Albert E . Mannes Fuqua School of Business , Duke University , Durham , North Carolina 27708 , aem15 @ duke . edu R ecent research has advanced our understanding of how people use the advice of others to update their beliefs . Because groups and teams play a signiﬁcant role in organizations and collectively are wiser than their individual members , it is important to understand their inﬂuence on belief revision as well . I report the results of four studies examining intuitions about group wisdom and the informational inﬂuence of groups . In their overt assessments , experimental participants rated larger groups as more accurate than smaller groups and discriminated more between them when group size was salient . When provided advice , participants relied more on groups than individuals to update their beliefs , but were only modestly sensitive to group size . Most were suboptimal in the use of that advice , overweighting their initial beliefs and underweighting the more valid judgment of the group . Thus although acknowledged in principle , the wisdom of crowds is only shallowly manifest in observed behavior .

Introduction In this increasingly interconnected world , how indi - viduals use the opinions of others remains an impor - tant topic for decision - making researchers . In regard to the use of numerical judgments ( e . g . , a sales forecast , probability estimate , etc . ) , recent research describing intuitive combining strategies generally follows one of two paradigms . First is the panel - of - experts paradigm , in which individuals form a judgment on the basis of two or more expert opinions ( Budescu 2006 , Budescu and Rantilla 2000 , Budescu et al . 2003 , Fischer and Harvey 1999 , Maines 1996 , Yaniv 1997 ) . 1 The consen - sus from this research is that people tend to average these opinions but err in their assignment of weights . Second is the advice - taking paradigm , in which indi - viduals update their prior beliefs with the opinion of one or more advisors ( Bonaccio and Dalal 2006 , Harvey and Fischer 1997 , Harvey and Harries 2004 , Harvey et al . 2000 , Koehler and Beauregard 2006 , Lim and O’Connor 1995 , Soll and Larrick 2009 , Yaniv 2004 , Yaniv and Kleinberger 2000 , Yaniv and Milyavsky 2007 ) . This work has reached a similar conclusion : People use advice to improve their beliefs but improp - erly weight judgments of the self and advisor ( s ) . In particular , people tend to favor their own , initial beliefs and underweight advice . One dimension neglected by both these traditions is the effect of collective group judgments on indi - vidual beliefs . That is , what is the differential impact 1 In this paper , the terms opinion , judgment , estimate , and belief are used interchangeably , as are combining , integrating , and aggregating . on our beliefs of advice provided by a group rather than an individual ? This is important for multiple rea - sons . Teams are prevalent in modern organizations . In a recent survey , 48 % reported using teams in some form , the average size of which was 11 people , and they were more likely in ﬁrms with multiple depart - ments and revenues exceeding $ 100 million ( Devine et al . 1999 ) . Moreover , team and group judgments are frequently wiser than those of individuals ( Einhorn et al . 1977 , Gigone and Hastie 1997 , Hastie 1986 , Hill 1982 ) , the case for which was recently popularized by Surowiecki ( 2004 ) in The Wisdom of Crowds . Thus , a normative argument can be made that group and team judgments should be more inﬂuential in gen - eral than individual judgments . Finally , research into the study of groups as producers of information ( e . g . , Hinsz et al . 1997 ) has not been accompanied by an understanding of the consumption of that information by individual decision makers . Although researchers using both the panel - of - experts and advice - taking paradigms have used multiple experts or advisors in their studies ( e . g . , Budescu 2006 , Yaniv and Milyavsky 2007 ) , they are presented as distinct social entities ( cf . Wilder 1977 ) and offer individual opinions , not collec - tive judgments . Thus , their research does not address this question directly . In contrast , some of the more memorable experi - ments of social psychology in the last century have revealed the profound inﬂuence groups have on indi - vidual beliefs ( e . g . , Asch 1951 , Sherif 1935 ) . It is impor - tant to distinguish in this research , however , between 1267 Mannes : Are We Wise About the Wisdom of Crowds ? 1268 Management Science 55 ( 8 ) , pp . 1267 – 1279 , ©2009 INFORMS the normative and informational social inﬂuence of groups ( Deutsch and Gerard 1955 , Kelman 1958 ) . The former refers to temporary compliance with a group judgment to satisfy the expectations of others , but is not accompanied by a permanent internalization of the group’s belief . A classic example is the willingness of people to go along with patently incorrect judg - ments by a unanimous majority about the length of a line ( Asch 1951 ) . The inﬂuence of present concern , however , is a group’s informational inﬂuence on indi - vidual beliefs , which refers to a permanent internaliza - tion of the group’s judgment ( or a part thereof ) to hold veridical beliefs about reality ( Festinger 1954 ) . Sherif’s ( 1935 ) studies of group - norm formation in judgments about the illusory movement of light induced by the autokinetic effect are a better example of informational inﬂuence . Nonetheless , as in the studies of norma - tive inﬂuence , the stimuli and group judgments in this work were purposely designed to be deceptive and maladaptive ( Allen 1965 ) . Evidence for the informa - tional inﬂuence of groups in tasks more representative of those encountered in natural social environments is lacking ( Brunswik 1955 , Tajfel 1969 ) . The purpose of the current research is to address this gap in our understanding of group informational inﬂuence . After reviewing relevant theory , I report the results of four experiments that assessed the inﬂu - ence of group judgments on individual beliefs . For this purpose I chose to use an advice - taking paradigm , which focuses on belief revision or updating instead of belief formation . In this paradigm , participants make a series of initial judgments and subsequently revise them aided by the additional judgment of an inﬂu - ence source . 2 In past advice - taking research this inﬂu - ence source has been one or more distinct advisors , but the current research uses groups of various sizes . The participants’ ﬁnal judgments are modeled as an addi - tive linear combination of their initial beliefs and the group judgments . By examining the weights the par - ticipants place on each cue , I assess the relative inﬂu - ence of the group in participants’ judgment policies ( cf . Hoffman 1960 ) . 2 . Theory and Hypotheses 2 . 1 . Informational Inﬂuence of Groups Although plagued by the confounding of norma - tive and informational inﬂuence in the same studies ( Campbell and Fairey 1989 ) , research on social inﬂu - ence does predict that groups will be more inﬂuential than sole individuals on our beliefs . Formal models have consistently demonstrated that conformity to a source judgment increases as a monotonic function 2 Source is used as a more general term to include both individuals and groups . of source size ( Bond 2005 , Campbell and Fairey 1989 , Latané 1981 , Latané and Wolf 1981 , Tanford and Penrod 1984 ) . Thus , two people are more inﬂuential than one , three more than two , and so forth , although the exact functional form of the relationship varies by model and study . In the case of informational inﬂuence , a possi - ble explanation for this result is that people believe group judgments are more accurate than individ - ual judgments—that is , they appreciate the wisdom of crowds . People are sensitive to asymmetries in expertise and place more weight on the perceived expert in their combining strategies ( Birnbaum and Stegner 1979 , Budescu et al . 2003 , Harvey and Fischer 1997 , Lim and O’Connor 1995 , Maines 1996 , Sniezek and Van Swol 2001 , Yaniv and Kleinberger 2000 ) . Therefore , as groups grow wiser with increases in size , albeit at a diminishing rate ( Einhorn et al . 1977 , Hogarth 1978 , Libby and Blashﬁeld 1978 ) , people are expected to place more weight on their judg - ments . Direct evidence for this prediction comes from a recent study of attitude formation in which experi - mental participants high in accuracy motivation were more inﬂuenced by a ﬁctitious consensus opinion of 1 , 000 respondents than by the identical opinion of 10 respondents and rated the former as more reliable than the latter ( Darke et al . 1998 ) . Hypothesis 1 ( H1 ) . The relative inﬂuence of group judgments on individuals’ ﬁnal beliefs will increase mono - tonically with group size . Yet there is reason to predict that people will make suboptimal use of group judgments . In an early exper - iment , Jenness ( 1932 ) had students guess the num - ber of beans in a bottle , meet in 3 - person teams to submit a consensus group estimate , and then provide updated individual guesses . The average absolute individual errors were 305 and 122 beans before and after team discussion , respectively . Clearly , meeting as a group improved individual judgment . However , the average absolute error of the team judgments was 91 beans ! Seemingly , the students placed too much weight on their initial beliefs and too little on the team judgment in their ﬁnal estimate . This is common in the advice - taking literature , where average weights on others’ opinions are in the 0 . 20 – 0 . 40 range and at the item level are frequently zero ( Goldberg 1954 , Harvey and Fischer 1997 , Harvey and Harries 2004 , Koehler and Beauregard 2006 , Lim and O’Connor 1995 , Soll and Larrick 2009 , Yaniv 2004 , Yaniv and Kleinberger 2000 ) . This bias in favor of one’s own beliefs does not arise from simple arithmetic errors during opinion aggre - gation , though these are surely present . In a study by Lim and O’Connor ( 1995 ) , experimental participants could specify the weights for the linear combination Mannes : Are We Wise About the Wisdom of Crowds ? Management Science 55 ( 8 ) , pp . 1267 – 1279 , ©2009 INFORMS 1269 of judgments without having to make the actual calculation . If they knew the appropriate weights to assign , this decision - support system should have improved the accuracy of the composite judgments . Surprisingly , they found the opposite : participants speciﬁed weights that led to less accurate compos - ites vis - à - vis a control group who combined the judg - ments intuitively . Instead , the bias may be explained by a combination of factors : a general conservatism in belief updating ( Edwards 1982 ) , anchoring or order effects ( Hogarth and Einhorn 1992 , Tversky and Kahneman 1974 ) , access only to reasons for one’s own judgments ( Yaniv and Kleinberger 2000 ) , and undue attention paid to a focal hypothesis ( in this case , one’s initial belief ) ( Schkade and Kahneman 1998 , Wilson et al . 2000 ) . Even if people appreciate in principle the wisdom of crowds , this bias is not expected to disappear with group judgments . Because the relationship between the size of a group and the validity of its average judgment is a function of both members’ expertise and the correlations among their judgments ( Hogarth 1978 ) , applying the law of large numbers to any particular situation is difﬁcult even for sophisticated judges . And in many cases people act in accordance with the “law of small numbers” instead ( Tversky and Kahneman 1971 ) . Accordingly , they are expected to be insufﬁciently sensitive to the size of the group in their judgment policies . Hypothesis 2 ( H2 ) . The relative inﬂuence of group judgments will be increasingly suboptimal as group size increases . To argue that people will make suboptimal use of a group’s informational beneﬁts requires a norma - tive standard . In terms of the linear model of judg - ment proposed in the introduction , this is often the policy speciﬁed by regressing the true values of the criterion on the predictor judgments . This yields cue weights that maximize the correlation between the linear composite and the criterion . However , a policy that approximates the performance of this yet is an arguably fairer , ex ante prescriptive standard is unit weighting ( Armstrong 2001 , Clemen 1989 , Dawes and Corrigan 1974 , Einhorn and Hogarth 1975 ) . The arith - metic mean , for example , is a unit - weighted com - posite . Moreover , when one of the judgments is a group’s mean estimate , unit weighting is equivalent to a weighted average . That is , when combining a prior belief with the mean judgment of an N - person group , unit weighting implies a weight of 1 / (cid:2)N + 1 (cid:3) on the prior belief and a weight of N / (cid:2)N + 1 (cid:3) on the group’s judgment . For example , imagine a sales executive updating her own belief about future sales with the mean forecast of a 4 - person analyst team . In total there are ﬁve opinions among them ( that is , the sales executive’s forecast and the four forecasts sum - marized by the team’s mean ) . Unit weighting means that each opinion contributes 20 % to the ﬁnal judg - ment . Thus , in this case , the executive’s intuitively revised belief can be compared to a weighted - average composite that places 80 % of the weight on the team’s mean judgment and 20 % on the executive’s prior belief . For the remainder of this paper , this will be referred to as an ego - neutral judgment policy , in con - trast to an egocentric judgment policy that overweights judgments of the self ( Yaniv and Kleinberger 2000 ) . 3 To restate H2 in light of this standard , individuals’ intuitive judgment policies are expected to feature weights on the group that increasingly fall short of those implied by an ego - neutral judgment policy . 2 . 2 . Beneﬁting from Group Judgments Research on the inﬂuence of groups by and large has focused on its detrimental impact on individual judg - ments . In contrast , a contribution of this research is to show the beneﬁts of yielding to a group’s infor - mational inﬂuence . If people recognize the wisdom of crowds and place more weight on their judgments , the validity of their revised beliefs will increase . Part of these gains will be due simply to averaging one judgment with a nonredundant second judgment , but part will reﬂect the superior expertise of the groups . Thus , these improvements are predicted to be greater for larger , wiser groups . Hypothesis 3 ( H3 ) . The inﬂuence of group judgments will improve individual beliefs monotonically with group size . As discussed , intuitive judgment policies are ex - pected to be egocentric compared with ego - neutral judgment policies . Whether this is consequential depends on the validity of the additional judgment . Individuals who receive advice from a sole individual typically combine the judgments with approximately 0 . 70 / 0 . 30 weights on the self and advisor , respectively ( Harvey and Fischer 1997 , Koehler and Beauregard 2006 , Lim and O’Connor 1995 , Yaniv 2004 ) . With advisors of similar expertise , this deviation from the 0 . 50 / 0 . 50 weights of an ego - neutral policy will have little effect . This is because the greatest gain in validity is from one judgment to two ( Einhorn et al . 1977 , Hogarth 1978 , Libby and Blashﬁeld 1978 ) , which will be robust to deviations from unit weighting ( Dawes and Corrigan 1974 ) . When advised by groups , however , the marginal contribution one’s own belief 3 The terms ego - neutral and egocentric in this sense are strictly descriptive and do not imply that motivational factors related to self - enhancement or ego - maintenance are necessarily affecting judgment policies . Also note that the weights implied by an ego - neutral judgment policy may be greater or less than optimal weights derived through regression . Mannes : Are We Wise About the Wisdom of Crowds ? 1270 Management Science 55 ( 8 ) , pp . 1267 – 1279 , ©2009 INFORMS can make to a composite judgment quickly declines . Overweighting it will lead to signiﬁcant underperfor - mance vis - à - vis an ego - neutral policy . Hypothesis 4 ( H4 ) . The suboptimal inﬂuence of groups in belief revision will be more consequential with larger groups . 3 . Overview of Studies The advice - taking paradigm used in these exper - iments is well suited to the study of a group’s informational inﬂuence . Typical studies of group inﬂuence tend to confound normative and infor - mational inﬂuence , making separate assessments of them problematic . The present studies incorporate a number of features designed to minimize norma - tive pressures to conform and to maximize infor - mational inﬂuence ( Allen 1965 , Campbell and Fairey 1989 , Deutsch and Gerard 1955 , Kaplan 1989 , Tajfel 1969 ) . Namely , experimental participants respond pri - vately and anonymously to the group judgment ; they are rewarded for accuracy , which motivates the search for truth ; and the judgments are difﬁcult but veriﬁ - able and ecological ( i . e . , they are not manufactured to be better or worse than those of the participants ) . The results of three experiments are reported that examined the levels and consequences of group infor - mational inﬂuence . The primary experimental factor was source size , manipulated between participants in two studies and within participants in one . Inﬂuence was measured using an idiographic , regression - based approach common in the decision - making literature ( see Cooksey 1996 , Hoffman 1960 ) . Each participant made multiple quantity estimates with the help of two cues : his or her own initial belief and the judg - ment of an inﬂuence source . A multiple regression model for each participant summarized his or her judgment policy . 4 Because the criterion and predic - tor judgments were similarly scaled , unstandardized regression coefﬁcients captured the importance of each cue . Though not without shortcomings as a mea - sure of importance ( Bonaccio and Dalal 2006 , Cooksey 1996 ) , these coefﬁcients were directly interpretable , preserving both the direction and relative strength of each cue’s inﬂuence . To test hypotheses about inﬂu - ence , coefﬁcients on the inﬂuence source were com - pared across experimental factors . To assess how well participants proﬁted from advice , the accuracy of their ﬁnal estimates was compared with that of their 4 More precisely , because of the multilevel structure of the data , I used hierarchical linear modeling with empirical Bayes estimation of the regression coefﬁcients for each participant ( Raudenbush and Bryk 2002 ) . This exploits the unique information from each par - ticipant and the information from the pooled sample to improve estimation . initial estimates and the estimates formed by an ego - neutral judgment policy . Leading off , though , is a preliminary study in which people were asked directly about their percep - tions of the wisdom of crowds . 3 . 1 . Study 1 3 . 1 . 1 . Task and Procedure . Sixty - three students from a private U . S . university ( 40 female ; M AGE = 20 (cid:4) 4 years ) participated in the experiment in exchange for a participation fee of $ 5 . Participants sequen - tially rated the validity of judgments made by 2 - and 9 - person groups on a 7 - point Likert scale ( 1 = Extremely inaccurate , 7 = Extremely accurate ) . They were asked : “Imagine that you are making tempera - ture predictions . You get an average estimate from a group of 2 [ 9 ] people ( i . e . , the sum of the estimates divided by 2 [ 9 ] ) . Over many predictions , how accu - rate do you believe the group’s estimate will be ? ” The order of ratings ( i . e . , 2 - then - 9 versus 9 - then - 2 ) was assigned randomly between participants . 3 . 1 . 2 . Results and Discussion . Sample sizes were 35 and 28 in the 2 - then - 9 and 9 - then - 2 conditions , respectively . A repeated - measures analysis of vari - ance indicated that the accuracy of 9 - person group judgments ( M = 4 (cid:4) 3 , SD = 1 (cid:4) 3 ) was rated higher than that of 2 - person group judgments ( M = 3 (cid:4) 1 , SD = 1 (cid:4) 2 ) ( F (cid:2) 1 (cid:5) 61 (cid:3) = 61 (cid:4) 67 , MSE = 0 (cid:4) 740 , p < 0 (cid:4) 001 ; d = 0 (cid:4) 95 ) . This within - participants difference was not signiﬁ - cantly affected by the order in which the ratings were made . The same pattern also emerged between partic - ipants , albeit diminished , when comparing the ratings made ﬁrst in each order condition : 9 - person group judgments ( M = 4 (cid:4) 0 , SD = 1 (cid:4) 3 ) were rated as more accurate than 2 - person group judgments ( M = 3 (cid:4) 4 , SD = 1 (cid:4) 2 ) ( F (cid:2) 1 (cid:5) 61 (cid:3) = 4 (cid:4) 59 , MSE = 1 (cid:4) 49 , p < 0 (cid:4) 05 ; d = 0 (cid:4) 54 ) . In sum , when asked to compare 2 - and 9 - person groups directly , participants rated the latter as more accurate . The results suggest that people have the cor - rect intuitions about the ordinal relationship between judgment validity and group size ( Darke et al . 1998 ) . Whether this was also true of people’s behavior was the subject of the remaining studies . 3 . 2 . Study 2 3 . 2 . 1 . Task and Procedure . Eighty students from a private U . S . university ( 48 female ; M AGE = 19 (cid:4) 9 years ) participated in the experiment in exchange for a participation fee of $ 4 and a bonus for accuracy ( M = $ 2 (cid:4) 34 , SD = $ 0 (cid:4) 69 ) . The task was to estimate the average high temperature in January of 20 U . S . cities with the aid of an inﬂuence source . The size of the inﬂuence source—1 , 2 , 4 , or 9 people—was manipulated between participants . These sizes were Mannes : Are We Wise About the Wisdom of Crowds ? Management Science 55 ( 8 ) , pp . 1267 – 1279 , ©2009 INFORMS 1271 chosen deliberately to facilitate use of an ego - neutral judgment policy ( i . e . , weights on the source of 0 . 50 , 0 . 67 , 0 . 80 , and 0 . 90 , respectively ) . The 20 cities were chosen by randomly generating ﬁve - digit numbers and matching those to U . S . postal zip codes . Fifteen separate students estimated the average high tem - perature in January ( in degrees Fahrenheit ) for these cities on a prior occasion in exchange for a small payment . Sources of size 1 , 2 , 4 , and 9 people were randomly generated from this pool , and for each city the mean of source members’ temperature esti - mates was calculated . This was the advice presented to the participants ( the individual estimates consti - tuting the average were not presented ) . To ensure the sample estimates were representative on average across participants and to reduce bias introduced by any one sample , this process was repeated until there were 15 samples of 1 - person sources , 15 samples of 2 - person sources , and so forth ; within condition par - ticipants received 1 of these 15 samples . As for the incentive to be accurate , each city was worth 25 cents , and for each degree Fahrenheit by which a partici - pant’s estimate missed the truth , he or she lost 2 cents . Thus , participants could earn a $ 5 . 00 bonus for per - fect estimates and were equally penalized for over - or underestimation . Though they could lose money at the item level , the minimum bonus over all 20 cities was truncated at zero . After passing a test to ensure comprehension of the bonus payment , participants proceeded to Part 1 . In Part 1 participants made their initial , unaided temperature estimates . The cities were presented sequentially and in random order to each person . Participants entered and conﬁrmed their temperature estimate for each city on the computer . They did not receive feedback on their performance during the task , nor could they return to prior estimates . They were also unaware they would revise these estimates in the next part and assumed the accuracy of their initial estimates determined their bonus . In Part 2 participants learned that they could revise their initial estimates with the aid of an additional opinion and that the accuracy of these ﬁnal estimates determined their bonus . The cities were presented sequentially and in random order . Each trial included the city , the participant’s initial estimate , and the esti - mate of an inﬂuence source . These were described as “the estimate of another student” ( 1 - person source ) or “the average estimate of 2 (cid:6) 4 (cid:5) 9 (cid:7) students” surveyed on a prior occasion . Explanation and examples of “the average estimate” were provided prior to starting . Participants entered and conﬁrmed their ﬁnal esti - mate on the computer . They did not receive feedback on their performance during the task , nor could they return to prior estimates . Participants answered a few questions upon completion of the task , after which they were debriefed and paid . 3 . 2 . 2 . Dependent Measures . Inﬂuence was com - pared for two judgment policies . For the observed judgment policy , ﬁnal estimates were modeled as an additive linear combination of the initial , unaided esti - mates and the estimates of the inﬂuence source . The unstandardized regression coefﬁcient on the source estimates measured the observed level of source inﬂu - ence ( see Footnote 4 ) . For the ego - neutral judgment policy , levels of source inﬂuence were set at 0 . 50 , 0 . 67 , 0 . 80 , and 0 . 90 for the 1 - , 2 - , 4 - , and 9 - person sources , respectively . Performance was measured as the mean absolute deviation ( MAD ) between participants’ ﬁnal ( i . e . , revised ) estimates and the true tempera - tures across the 20 cities . MAD is a widely accepted measure of accuracy for symmetric loss functions ( Armstrong 2001 ) , with lower MADs indicating bet - ter performance . MADs were also calculated for each participant’s initial , source , and ego - neutral estimates . 3 . 2 . 3 . Results . Preliminary Analysis . Table 1 indicates that the expertise of participants ( i . e . , initial MADs ) did not vary systematically across conditions ( F (cid:2) 3 (cid:5) 76 (cid:3) = 0 (cid:4) 66 , MSE = 28 (cid:4) 22 , ns ) . Nevertheless , because initial MAD was correlated with both inﬂuence ( r = 0 (cid:4) 34 ) and ﬁnal MAD ( r = 0 (cid:4) 72 ) , it was included as a covariate in the analysis of these measures to increase power . As expected , the validity of the source increased with source size ( i . e . , source MADs declined with size ) in accordance with the law of large numbers ( F (cid:2) 3 (cid:5) 76 (cid:3) = 17 (cid:4) 17 , MSE = 2 (cid:4) 10 , p < 0 (cid:4) 001 ; R 2 = 0 (cid:4) 40 ) . Inﬂuence . The mean level of source inﬂuence was 0 . 54 ( SD = 0 (cid:4) 20 ) , which varied by condition ( F (cid:2) 3 (cid:5) 75 (cid:3) = 9 (cid:4) 19 , MSE = 0 (cid:4) 028 , p < 0 (cid:4) 001 ; R 2 = 0 (cid:4) 35 ) . Table 1 indi - cates that source inﬂuence increased concavely with source size . An orthogonal trend analysis for unequal intervals ( Keppel 1982 ) revealed signiﬁcant linear ( F (cid:2) 1 (cid:5) 75 (cid:3) = 14 (cid:4) 99 , p < 0 (cid:4) 001 ; R 2 = 0 (cid:4) 17 ) and quadratic ( F (cid:2) 1 (cid:5) 75 (cid:3) = 12 (cid:4) 56 , p < 0 (cid:4) 001 ; R 2 = 0 (cid:4) 14 ) trends ; more - over , the drop in inﬂuence from 4 - to 9 - person groups Table 1 Mean Levels of Inﬂuence and Performance in Study 2 Source size Dependentvariable 1 2 4 9 Inﬂuence a 0 (cid:2) 39 ( 0 . 22 ) d (cid:3) e 0 (cid:2) 49 ( 0 . 16 ) f 0 (cid:2) 66 ( 0 . 14 ) d (cid:3) f 0 (cid:2) 61 ( 0 . 17 ) e Performance ( MAD ) b Initial 10 (cid:2) 32 ( 7 . 59 ) 9 (cid:2) 88 ( 3 . 56 ) 12 (cid:2) 00 ( 5 . 79 ) 10 (cid:2) 13 ( 3 . 01 ) Source c 9 (cid:2) 16 ( 2 . 39 ) 7 (cid:2) 76 ( 1 . 28 ) 6 (cid:2) 77 ( 0 . 87 ) 6 (cid:2) 06 ( 0 . 51 ) Final 7 (cid:2) 88 ( 4 . 65 ) 5 (cid:2) 91 ( 1 . 40 ) 6 (cid:2) 69 ( 1 . 90 ) 6 (cid:2) 77 ( 1 . 10 ) Improvement ( % ) 18 ( 19 ) 35 ( 19 ) 37 ( 23 ) 29 ( 15 ) Ego - neutral c 7 (cid:2) 72 ( 4 . 05 ) 5 (cid:2) 63 ( 1 . 49 ) 6 (cid:2) 20 ( 1 . 63 ) 5 (cid:2) 88 ( 0 . 66 ) Notes . n = 20 .

Thus , the hypothesis of a monotonic increase in informational inﬂuence with larger sources ( H1 ) was supported ( Braver and Sheets 1993 ) . Groups were more inﬂuen - tial than individuals , and larger groups more inﬂuen - tial than smaller groups at a declining rate . Although clearly inﬂuenced by the additional judg - ment , 67 of 80 participants fell short of the ego - neutral level of inﬂuence . Differences between ego - neutral and observed levels of inﬂuence were calculated for each participant and subjected to a one - way analy - sis of covariance . Across conditions the average dif - ference was 0 . 18 ( SD = 0 (cid:4) 19 ) , which was signiﬁcantly greater than zero ( F (cid:2) 1 (cid:5) 75 (cid:3) = 50 (cid:4) 69 , p < 0 (cid:4) 001 ) . These differences also increased with source size as expected ( F (cid:2) 1 (cid:5) 75 (cid:3) = 11 (cid:4) 48 , MSE = 0 (cid:4) 028 , p < 0 (cid:4) 01 ; R 2 = 0 (cid:4) 13 for the linear trend ) . Thus , H2 was supported . Performance . Because participants relied to some extent on the source estimate , they improved their judgments . Final MADs were lower than initial MADs for 73 of 80 participants , with an average improvement of 30 % ( SD = 20 % ) . As Table 1 makes clear , however , improvement was not monotonically greater for larger groups . Participants underperformed the ego - neutral judg - ment policies . Final MADs were lower than ego - neutral MADs for only 30 of 80 participants . A repeated - measures analysis of covariance indicated that ﬁnal MADs were greater than ego - neutral MADs ( F (cid:2) 1 (cid:5) 76 (cid:3) = 9 (cid:4) 09 , MSE = 0 (cid:4) 926 , p < 0 (cid:4) 01 ; R 2 = 0 (cid:4) 11 ) and that this underperformance increased with source size ( F (cid:2) 1 (cid:5) 75 (cid:3) = 3 (cid:4) 69 , MSE = 1 (cid:4) 65 , p < 0 (cid:4) 10 ; R 2 = 0 (cid:4) 05 for the linear trend ) . In other words , underperformance was trivial for those advised by sole individuals ( d = 0 (cid:4) 04 ) but substantial for those advised by 9 - person groups ( d = 0 (cid:4) 98 ) . This supported H4 . 3 . 2 . 4 . Discussion . Even in the absence of contem - poraneous feedback , participants made more use of group judgments than those of individual advisors . Participants improved upon their initial judgments but were conservative in their use of advice— increases in inﬂuence declined at a faster rate than recommended by an ego - neutral judgment policy . Accordingly , their observed policies failed to weight appropriately the more accurate and reliable judg - ments . The consequences of this for performance depended on the size ( and corresponding accuracy ) of the inﬂuence source . Participants in this experiment were modestly sen - sitive to group size . However , because the size of an inﬂuence source and its validity are correlated , it can - not be ruled out that people were inﬂuenced by exper - tise rather than source size . As previously discussed , people are capable of detecting differences in expertise and placing , though imperfectly , more weight on the perceived expert . Despite the lack of explicit feedback in this study , cues may have been available to the superior accuracy of groups over sole advisors and of larger groups over smaller . This potential confound is tested in Study 3 with a control condition that omits information about the inﬂuence source . If sensitivity to expertise is driving inﬂuence , then larger groups will be more inﬂuential than smaller groups even in the absence of information about group size . Moreover , there will be little difference in inﬂuence between the control condition and the condition in which informa - tion about group size is available . Although the egocentric weighting of one’s own opinions in belief revision is a robust phenomenon , there remains an incomplete understanding of why it occurs . One potential explanation is that a per - son’s initial belief serves as a focal hypothesis tested against an alternative provided by the inﬂuence source . Research suggests that a focal hypothesis may be given undue attention and weight compared with an alternative ( Schkade and Kahneman 1998 , Wilson et al . 2000 ) . If focalism explains the over - weighting of initial beliefs , then opinions presented as a focal hypothesis should receive similar weight rela - tive to an alternative whether provided by the self or another . This explanation is tested in Study 3 . 3 . 3 . Study 3 3 . 3 . 1 . Task and Procedure . One hundred and ﬁfty students from a private U . S . university ( 70 female ; M AGE = 21 (cid:4) 7 years ) participated in the experiment in exchange for a participation fee of $ 6 and a bonus for accuracy ( M = $ 2 (cid:4) 67 , SD = $ 0 (cid:4) 37 ) . The task was the same as in the prior study : to estimate the aver - age high temperature in January of 20 U . S . cities with the aid of an inﬂuence source . The size of the inﬂu - ence source—groups of 3 or 15 people—was manipu - lated between participants . These groups were chosen at random from the participants of Study 2 , and for each city the mean of group members’ initial tem - perature estimates was calculated . As in the prior study , this process was repeated until there were 25 samples of estimates for 3 - and 15 - person groups each . After assignment to a group size and sam - ple , participants were further assigned to a second , three - level between - participants condition . The base condition replicated the procedure of Study 2 : Partici - pants made initial , unaided temperature estimates and then revised them aided by the average estimate of a 3 - or 15 - person group . Participants in the control con - dition did the same , except they were not provided any information about the inﬂuence source . Instead , they were simply provided an “additional estimate” that could be more or less accurate than their ini - tial estimate and which they were to use however they wished to revise their initial beliefs . Aside from this difference , the additional estimates were identical Mannes : Are We Wise About the Wisdom of Crowds ? Management Science 55 ( 8 ) , pp . 1267 – 1279 , ©2009 INFORMS 1273 to those of a matched participant in the base condi - tion . Participants in these two conditions also indi - cated how conﬁdent they were following each ini - tial estimate ( i . e . , not at all , somewhat , fairly , or very conﬁdent ) . Finally , participants in the focal condition were also matched to a participant in the base condi - tion . These participants did not make their own initial estimates . For each city , which was anonymous ( e . g . , city 1 , city 2 , etc . ) , they were provided a focal judg - ment . This was the initial estimate of their matched participant and his or her conﬁdence in that estimate . After a ﬁve - second delay , the average estimate of the 3 - or 15 - person groups was presented , and partici - pants then made their own estimate . As in the prior study , participants did not receive feedback during the task , nor could they return to prior estimates . Each city was worth 20 cents , and for each degree Fahrenheit by which a participant’s esti - mate missed the truth , he or she lost 1 cent . Thus , participants could earn a $ 4 . 00 bonus for perfect esti - mates and were equally penalized for over - or under - estimation . The minimum bonus over all 20 cities was truncated at zero . Participants answered a few ques - tions upon completion of the task , after which they were debriefed and paid . 5 3 . 3 . 2 . Results . Preliminary Analysis . Table 2 indicates that the expertise of participants ( i . e . , initial MADs ) in the base and control conditions did not vary ( F (cid:2) 3 (cid:5) 48 (cid:3) = 0 (cid:4) 17 , MSE = 23 (cid:4) 47 , ns ) . Nevertheless , because initial MAD was correlated with both inﬂuence ( r = 0 (cid:4) 27 ) and ﬁnal MAD ( r = 0 (cid:4) 40 ) , it was included as a covariate in the analyses of these measures to increase power . As expected , the validity of the group increased with group size ( i . e . , source MADs declined with size ) in accordance with the law of large numbers ( F (cid:2) 1 (cid:5) 48 (cid:3) = 19 (cid:4) 15 , MSE = 2 (cid:4) 63 , p < 0 (cid:4) 001 ; R 2 = 0 (cid:4) 29 ) . Inﬂuence . The mean level of inﬂuence was 0 . 60 ( SD = 0 (cid:4) 17 ) , which varied by condition ( F (cid:2) 5 (cid:5) 95 (cid:3) = 7 (cid:4) 97 , MSE = 0 (cid:4) 024 , p < 0 (cid:4) 001 ; R 2 = 0 (cid:4) 30 ) . Replicating the pat - tern of the prior study , participants in the base condi - tion were more inﬂuenced by larger groups ( F (cid:2) 1 (cid:5) 47 (cid:3) = 6 (cid:4) 82 , MSE = 0 (cid:4) 024 , p < 0 (cid:4) 05 ; R 2 = 0 (cid:4) 13 ) , supporting H1 . Forty - six of 50 fell short of using ego - neutral weights with the group estimates , but egocentrism was no 5 One of these questions , posed prior to any feedback about per - formance , asked participants to speculate about the similarity or dissimilarity of the individual temperature estimates constituting the group’s average judgment ( 7 - point Likert scale : − 3 = Very dis - similar , + 3 = Very similar ) . An anonymous reviewer pointed out that participants might ( justiﬁably ) place less weight on the aver - age if they believed the individual constituent judgments redun - dant . There was no association between this rating and inﬂuence ( r = − 0 (cid:4) 01 ) . Thus , there did not appear to be a relationship between inﬂuence and the expected similarity of group members’ judgments .

Two tests were carried out to examine whether sensitivity to the accuracy of the group estimates accounted for the higher inﬂuence of 15 - person groups in the base condition rather than information about group size . First , if people were sensitive to the accuracy of the additional estimates apart from information about their source , then inﬂuence by 15 - person groups should have been higher than inﬂu - ence by 3 - person groups in the control condition ( which had no information about the source of the additional estimate ) . Although inﬂuence by anony - mous 15 - person groups was slightly higher than that of anonymous 3 - person groups ( see Table 2 ) , this dif - ference was not signiﬁcant ( F (cid:2) 1 (cid:5) 47 (cid:3) = 2 (cid:4) 43 , MSE = 0 (cid:4) 020 , ns ) . Second , inﬂuence should have been sim - ilar in the base and control conditions if perceived accuracy was the primary driver of inﬂuence . This was also not the case : Overall inﬂuence was signiﬁ - cantly greater in the base condition than in the control condition ( F (cid:2) 1 (cid:5) 47 (cid:3) = 15 (cid:4) 09 , MSE = 0 (cid:4) 022 , p < 0 (cid:4) 001 ; R 2 = 0 (cid:4) 24 ) . Thus , it appears that information about the groups’ size and not the perceived accuracy of their estimates was primarily responsible for the greater inﬂuence of larger groups . To test the focalism hypothesis , inﬂuence in the base and focal conditions was compared . If asymmetric attention to a focal judgment explains the discounting of additional information , then inﬂuence should not have differed between those revising their own judg - ments and those revising identical focal judgments provided to them . Here an interaction emerged with Mannes : Are We Wise About the Wisdom of Crowds ? 1274 Management Science 55 ( 8 ) , pp . 1267 – 1279 , ©2009 INFORMS group size ( F (cid:2) 1 (cid:5) 48 (cid:3) = 8 (cid:4) 40 , MSE = 0 (cid:4) 023 , p < 0 (cid:4) 01 ; R 2 = 0 (cid:4) 15 ) . Differences in inﬂuence between the base and focal conditions were not signiﬁcant for the 15 - person groups ( F (cid:2) 1 (cid:5) 24 (cid:3) = 0 (cid:4) 64 , MSE = 0 (cid:4) 025 , ns ) but were signiﬁcant for the 3 - person groups ( F (cid:2) 1 (cid:5) 24 (cid:3) = 11 (cid:4) 63 , MSE = 0 (cid:4) 021 , p < 0 (cid:4) 01 ; R 2 = 0 (cid:4) 33 ) . In the latter case , participants in the focal condition made much greater use of the group estimates than those in the base con - dition ( see Table 2 ) . However , because the results were ambiguous , additional analysis was carried out at the item level . If people overweight a focal hypothesis , then the frequency with which an initial ( i . e . , focal ) estimate is chosen as the ﬁnal estimate should have been similar in the base and focal conditions . Of the 1 , 924 cases in which the focal and group estimates differed in these conditions , participants in the base condition chose the focal estimate in 17 % of cases , whereas those in the focal condition chose it in only 4 % of cases ( X 2 (cid:2) 1 (cid:3) = 25 (cid:4) 98 , p < 0 (cid:4) 001 ) . This differ - ence was similar for 3 - person ( 15 % versus 5 % ) and 15 - person ( 20 % versus 4 % ) groups . In other words , people who revised their own estimates were more likely to stick with their initial beliefs than those pro - vided the initial belief as a focal hypothesis . Performance . Final MADs were lower for partici - pants advised by 15 - person versus 3 - person groups ( F (cid:2) 1 (cid:5) 95 (cid:3) = 7 (cid:4) 72 , MSE = 1 (cid:4) 98 , p < 0 (cid:4) 01 ; R 2 = 0 (cid:4) 08 ) and differed for those in the base , control , and focal con - ditions ( F (cid:2) 2 (cid:5) 95 (cid:3) = 4 (cid:4) 75 , p < 0 (cid:4) 05 ; R 2 = 0 (cid:4) 09 ) . Pairwise comparisons of adjusted means indicated that par - ticipants in the control condition performed signiﬁ - cantly worse than those in the base condition ; other differences were not signiﬁcant ( Tukey HSD tests , (cid:8) FW = 0 (cid:4) 05 ) . The performance of participants in the base and focal conditions was compared to that of an ego - neutral judgment policy in which the groups were weighted commensurate with their size ( that is , 0 . 75 and 0 . 94 for the 3 - and 15 - person groups , respec - tively ) . Analysis of covariance revealed that partici - pants’ intuitive policies were signiﬁcantly worse than the ego - neutral policy ( F (cid:2) 1 (cid:5) 96 (cid:3) = 41 (cid:4) 56 , MSE = 1 (cid:4) 09 , p < 0 (cid:4) 001 ; R 2 = 0 (cid:4) 30 ) and that this underperformance was greater for those advised by 15 - person groups ( F (cid:2) 1 (cid:5) 96 (cid:3) = 2 (cid:4) 78 , p < 0 (cid:4) 10 ; R 2 = 0 (cid:4) 03 ) . Underperfor - mance did not differ between the base and focal participants . 3 . 3 . 3 . Discussion . Participants in the base con - dition replicated many of the ﬁndings in Study 2 . Inﬂuence was higher by the 15 - person groups yet fell short of the ego - neutral levels . Performance improved because of this inﬂuence and was greater for those advised by 15 - person ( 37 % ) than 3 - person ( 30 % ) groups . Nonetheless , because these participants placed too much weight on their initial beliefs , they underperformed the ego - neutral judgment policies . This study also ruled out an alternative explana - tion for the inﬂuence of group size—that sensitivity to expertise leads people to place more weight on group judgments . If true , then participants in the control condition , who had no information about the size or source of the additional estimates , should have shown a similar pattern of inﬂuence as those in the base con - dition . This was not the case , nor did those in the control condition meaningfully discriminate between judgments provided by anonymous 3 - and 15 - person groups . Focalism was offered as one explanation for the ego - centric discounting of additional information . In this account , one’s initial belief serves as a focal hypoth - esis tested against an alternative hypothesis ( in this case , the group estimate ) . If focal hypotheses in gen - eral receive undue attention , then it should not mat - ter whether they are proposed by the self or another . The comparison of inﬂuence in the base and focal conditions was somewhat equivocal . Although no dif - ference was found at the aggregate level for those advised by 15 - person groups , supporting the focal - ism account , group inﬂuence was signiﬁcantly higher in the focal condition for those advised by 3 - person groups , undermining focalism as an explanation . At the item level , however , it was clear that people who made their own estimates were far more likely to pre - fer them over the alternative , group estimates than those who were simply provided the identical esti - mates as a focal hypothesis . Overall , the evidence sug - gests that the discounting of group advice is worse for those revising their own beliefs . Additional explana - tions for this are left for the general discussion . Participants in Studies 2 and 3 were insufﬁciently sensitive to size differences among groups , falling short of the normative , ego - neutral weights in a supermajority of cases . To be fair , group size is dif - ﬁcult to evaluate in isolation . It is not an inherently meaningful attribute , and this lack of evaluability may lead to magnitude insensitivity ( Hsee et al . 2005 ) . If people have correct intuitions about the wisdom of crowds ( as suggested by Study 1 ) , then direct , joint comparisons of multiple groups should increase the inﬂuence of larger ones beyond that seen in the between - participants designs of these studies ( Hsee et al . 1999 ) . Study 4 tests this by manipulating group size within participants . A second manipulation in Study 4 is whether the group judgment is framed as a “consensus” or “aver - age” estimate . Perhaps holding the participants back from placing more weight on the group judgment is a distrust of averaging . Larrick and Soll ( 2006 ) , for instance , asked students to estimate the accuracy of alternative forecasting strategies . Included in these were a group’s judgment arrived at through discus - sion and by deference to the most conﬁdent group Mannes : Are We Wise About the Wisdom of Crowds ? Management Science 55 ( 8 ) , pp . 1267 – 1279 , ©2009 INFORMS 1275 member , both of which were rated as superior to a simple average of the members’ forecasts . They concluded that the beneﬁts of averaging are appar - ent to people only in limited circumstances . If true , then group estimates framed as consensus judgments should receive more weight than those framed as averages . 3 . 4 . Study 4 3 . 4 . 1 . Task and Procedure . One hundred and twenty - ﬁve students from a public U . S . university ( 66 female ; M AGE = 19 (cid:4) 8 years ) participated in the exper - iment in exchange for a participation fee of $ 6 and a bonus for accuracy ( M = $ 0 (cid:4) 82 , SD = $ 0 (cid:4) 28 ) . The task was to estimate the ages of 38 celebrities aided by a group judgment . The size of the group—2 or 9 people—was manipulated within participants . Partici - pants were randomly assigned to one of four between - participants conditions formed by crossing judgment frame ( consensus versus average ) and order ( 2 - then - 9 versus 9 - then - 2 ) . Celebrities were randomly chosen from a list of actors and actresses worldwide . Forty - eight separate students estimated their ages on a prior occasion in exchange for a small payment . Groups of size 2 and 9 were randomly generated from this pool , and for each celebrity the mean of group members’ age estimates was calculated . This was the advice pre - sented to the participants . To reduce sampling bias , this process was repeated until there were 30 samples of 2 - person groups and 30 samples of 9 - person groups . Participants received 1 of these 30 samples . The procedure was similar to the prior studies . In Part 1 participants made their initial , unaided age estimates without feedback or awareness that they would revise them subsequently . In Part 2 the celebri - ties were presented again along with the partici - pant’s initial estimates in a sequence of two blocks : a block of 19 accompanied by the additional esti - mates of a 2 - person group , and a block of 19 accom - panied by the additional estimates of a 9 - person group . The celebrities in each block were constant for all participants . The estimates were described as “the average [ consensus ] estimate of 2 [ 9 ] other stu - dents” surveyed on a prior occasion . Explanations and examples of average and consensus estimates were provided prior to starting the revision . Par - ticipants entered and conﬁrmed their ﬁnal estimate on the computer . Each celebrity was worth 10 cents , and for each year by which a participant’s estimate missed the truth , he or she lost 1 cent . Thus , partici - pants could earn a $ 3 . 80 bonus for perfect estimates and were equally penalized for over - or underesti - mation . The minimum bonus over all 38 celebrities was truncated at zero . They did not receive feedback on their performance during the task , nor could they return to prior estimates .

Results . Preliminary analysis . The expertise of participants did not vary by judgment frame or order ( F (cid:2) 3 (cid:5) 92 (cid:3) = 0 (cid:4) 09 , MSE = 11 (cid:4) 57 , ns ) . Because initial MAD was cor - related with both inﬂuence ( r = 0 (cid:4) 37 ) and ﬁnal MAD ( r = 0 (cid:4) 71 ) , it was included as a covariate in analyses of these measures . As expected , 9 - person groups were more accurate than 2 - person groups ( F (cid:2) 1 (cid:5) 58 (cid:3) = 49 (cid:4) 63 , MSE = 0 (cid:4) 799 , p < 0 (cid:4) 001 ; R 2 = 0 (cid:4) 46 ) . Inﬂuence . Mean inﬂuence across the conditions was 0 . 64 ( SD = 0 (cid:4) 20 ) . Table 3 summarizes inﬂuence across conditions . A repeated - measures analysis of covari - ance failed to ﬁnd a main effect of judgment frame ( F (cid:2) 1 (cid:5) 92 (cid:3) = 0 (cid:4) 68 , MSE = 0 (cid:4) 034 , ns ) nor a meaningful interaction of frame with the other factors . There were signiﬁcant effects of order ( F (cid:2) 1 (cid:5) 92 (cid:3) = 6 (cid:4) 87 , p < 0 (cid:4) 05 ; R 2 = 0 (cid:4) 07 ) and group size ( F (cid:2) 1 (cid:5) 120 (cid:3) = 70 (cid:4) 03 , MSE = 0 (cid:4) 016 , p < 0 (cid:4) 001 ; R 2 = 0 (cid:4) 37 ) , qualiﬁed by an interaction between them ( F (cid:2) 1 (cid:5) 120 (cid:3) = 14 (cid:4) 16 , p < 0 (cid:4) 001 ; R 2 = 0 (cid:4) 11 ) .

As predicted , joint evaluation of group size led to greater discrimination between them . However , the effect of the joint eval - uation was not to increase the inﬂuence of 9 - person groups as intended , which did not differ whether encountered ﬁrst or second , but to decrease the inﬂu - ence of 2 - person groups . Performance . Only group size was a signiﬁcant pre - dictor of ﬁnal MAD ( F (cid:2) 1 (cid:5) 120 (cid:3) = 33 (cid:4) 80 , MSE = 0 (cid:4) 568 , p < 0 (cid:4) 001 ; R 2 = 0 (cid:4) 22 ) . Table 4 summarizes perfor - mance , collapsed across order and judgment frame . Final MADs were lower than initial MADs in 92 % of cases with 2 - person groups and 99 % of cases with 9 - person groups , with an average improvement of 27 % ( SD = 17 % ) . A repeated - measures analysis of covariance re - vealed that participants continued to underperform the ego - neutral judgment policies ( F (cid:2) 1 (cid:5) 362 (cid:3) = 10 (cid:4) 43 , MSE = 0 (cid:4) 642 , p < 0 (cid:4) 01 ; R 2 = 0 (cid:4) 03 ) , and this under - performance was greater with the 9 - person groups ( F (cid:2) 1 (cid:5) 362 (cid:3) = 19 (cid:4) 88 , p < 0 (cid:4) 001 ; R 2 = 0 (cid:4) 05 ) . Final MADs were similar to those of the ego - neutral estimates for 2 - person groups ( F (cid:2) 1 (cid:5) 91 (cid:3) = 1 (cid:4) 52 , MSE = 0 (cid:4) 757 , ns ; d = − 0 (cid:4) 06 ) but were signiﬁcantly worse for 9 - person groups ( F (cid:2) 1 (cid:5) 91 (cid:3) = 17 (cid:4) 13 , MSE = 0 (cid:4) 494 , p < 0 (cid:4) 001 ; d = 0 (cid:4) 64 ) . 3 . 4 . 3 . Discussion . Observed judgment policies were unaffected by the framing of the group judg - ment as a consensus or average estimate despite research showing that people have more faith in the former . Increasing the evaluability of group size did affect information use , but not as expected . The dif - ference in inﬂuence between 2 - and 9 - person groups was substantially larger in the second block of revi - sions . Yet this was due not to the enhanced inﬂuence of 9 - person groups but to the diminished inﬂuence of 2 - person groups . Use of the former’s judgments was higher than in Study 2 ( 0 . 71 versus 0 . 60 , perhaps due to differences in stimuli ) , which appeared to be a Figure 2 Observed and Ego - Neutral Levels of Source Inﬂuence Across Studies 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 0 4 8 12 16 20 24 28 32 36 40 Source size M ean i n f l uen c e Ego - neutral FittedStudy 2 Study 2A Study 3 Study 4 ceiling on the amount of inﬂuence by 9 - person groups in this task , even when evaluated after a 2 - person group . In contrast , evaluating 2 - person groups after 9 - person groups seemed to provide participants justi - ﬁcation for relying less on them . Thus , the enhanced evaluability of group size undermined informational inﬂuence instead of bolstering it . 4 . General Discussion Optimistic and pessimistic conclusions emerge from this examination of the informational inﬂuence of groups . Under conditions free of normative inﬂuence , people successfully used information provided by others to improve their judgments . In their behavior , they made monotonically greater use of group judg - ments , which improved the accuracy of their updated estimates . And in their explicit beliefs they correctly recognized the ordinal relationship between group size and validity on truth - plus - error judgments . In this study , ego - neutral weighting was prescribed as a straightforward judgment policy less stringent in its demands for rationality than a regression - based approach . Yet even by this more liberal standard , peo - ple were suboptimal users of group judgments . This is illustrated in Figure 2 , which plots the relationship between group size and inﬂuence across four studies . 6 The graph includes a line for the ego - neutral weights and a ﬁtted regression line for the 11 observed , mean levels of inﬂuence in these studies . Whereas the ego - neutral model of inﬂuence is described by (cid:3) y = k ( group size ) 1 ( group size + 1 ) − 1 with k = 1 (cid:5) the ﬁtted regression line ( R 2 = 0 (cid:4) 79 ) is described by (cid:3) y = 0 (cid:4) 83 ( group size ) 0 (cid:4) 88 ( group size + 1 ) − 0 (cid:4) 95 (cid:4) 6 Includes the results of an unreported experiment identical to Study 2 ( Study 2A ) except that participants were advised by 1 - , 4 - , or 40 - person sources . Mean inﬂuence across these conditions was 0 . 48 ( SD = 0 (cid:4) 24 ) , 0 . 57 ( SD = 0 (cid:4) 12 ) , and 0 . 60 ( SD = 0 (cid:4) 12 ) , respectively . Full details are available from the author .

Management Science 55 ( 8 ) , pp . 1267 – 1279 , ©2009 INFORMS 1277 The equations are similar , though even with this small sample their equivalence could be formally rejected ( F (cid:2) 3 (cid:5) 8 (cid:3) = 36 (cid:4) 54 , p < 0 (cid:4) 001 ) . Group accuracy does exhibit diminishing returns with size , but not at the rate implied by the intuitive judgment policies observed in the present study . 7 The present study adds two insights to research on the suboptimal use of additional information in belief revision . First , a lack of sophisticated appreciation for the law of large numbers makes it particularly acute when faced with group judgments . It is one thing to recognize that mean judgments will be more valid with increases in group size ; it is another to appreciate that the marginal contribution of an additional opin - ion to a group , including one’s own , approaches zero quite rapidly as the group increases . Second , the con - sequences of a suboptimal judgment policy are highly contingent . Participants advised by a sole individual or even by 2 - person groups did as well statistically as the ego - neutral policy . Their initial beliefs mean - ingfully contributed to the ﬁnal estimates , which were robust to deviations from the ego - neutral policies . Those advised by larger groups , however , substan - tially underperformed the ego - neutral policies . In these cases , deviations from unit weighting were not robust to the increasing asymmetry in expertise between the participant and group . Study 3 provided evidence that focalism ( Schkade and Kahneman 1998 , Wilson et al . 2000 ) does not explain egocentric judgment policies . Those revising their own judgments were less willing to abandon them than those provided the identical judgments as a focal hypothesis . Three additional explanations are worth exploring in future research . Yaniv and Kleinberger ( 2000 ) suggested that the availability of reasons for one’s own beliefs but not another’s increases support for the former ( Tversky and Koehler 1994 ) . It is also possible that a more basic attach - ment to one’s own judgments is responsible ( cf . Thaler 2000 ) , regardless of the support for those judgments . Finally , something as fundamental as anchoring or pri - macy effects may lead to conservatism in the use of additional information ( Edwards 1982 , Hogarth and Einhorn 1992 ) . Moreover , these are not disjoint theo - ries , and all may contribute to egocentrism in opinion revision . Although life does provide instances where policy makers make decisions based on aggregate judgments ( e . g . , average or consensus forecasts of inﬂation rates , gross domestic product , earnings , etc . ) , a reasonable 7 An anonymous reviewer correctly pointed out that as group size increases , it becomes increasingly hard to overweight the group judgment ; errors only become more likely in the other direction—underweighting . Presuming people do make errors , this will account for some of the difference in the curves of Figure 2 . objection to these ﬁndings is that we are often faced with a distribution of group members’ judgments instead of an aggregate . In the example provided ear - lier , the sales executive may prefer individual fore - casts from the analyst team instead of their consensus or mean forecast . Wilder ( 1977 ) argued that inﬂuence is more a function of the perceived number of distinct social entities than of the total size of the inﬂuence source . He found , for example , that two groups of two were more inﬂuential than one group of four . Thus , the more group members are perceived as distinct , the more their collective size has an impact . On the other hand , presenting the distribution of estimates may lead people to pick - and - choose judgments sim - ilar to their own . Yaniv and Milyavsky ( 2007 ) found that participants faced with a distribution of two , four , or eight opinions “egocentrically trimmed” those discrepant with their own before combining them , which suggests that deemphasizing a group’s collec - tive wisdom encourages people to incorporate only those individual judgments that are redundant with their own . The effect of knowing the distribution of mem - bers’ judgments on inﬂuence was therefore exam - ined in an additional study . Fifty - seven participants ( 21 female ; M AGE = 21 (cid:4) 8 years ) revised 35 estimates of celebrity ages advised by a 9 - person group and were rewarded for accuracy . They were randomly assigned to three conditions : 18 received only the average judgment of the group ; 20 received only the individual judgments constituting that average ; and 19 received both the average and individual judg - ments . Mean levels of inﬂuence across these condi - tions were 0 . 70 ( SD = 0 (cid:4) 15 ) , 0 . 75 ( SD = 0 (cid:4) 30 ) , and 0 . 68 ( SD = 0 (cid:4) 21 ) , respectively , which were statistically equivalent ( F (cid:2) 2 (cid:5) 34 (cid:3) = 0 (cid:4) 14 , MSE = 0 (cid:4) 051 , ns ) and sim - ilar to the level obtained in Study 4 . Hence this initial evidence did not indicate that having simultaneous access to the distribution of group members’ judg - ments has a meaningful effect on the use of their col - lective wisdom . 5 . Practical Implications Teams are playing an increasing role in organizations ( Devine et al . 1999 ) , presumably for their enhanced decision - making ability , among others . It is there - fore important to understand the inﬂuence of their judgments on decision makers . This research pro - vides preliminary evidence that collective wisdom is underappreciated . Perhaps experience with teams provides ample counterexamples to their beneﬁts : conformity due to normative pressures , the punish - ment of dissent , unproductive and interpersonal con - ﬂict , and so forth . Yet these pitfalls associated with consensus - based decision making can often be miti - gated by simply pooling member judgments , as was Mannes : Are We Wise About the Wisdom of Crowds ? 1278 Management Science 55 ( 8 ) , pp . 1267 – 1279 , ©2009 INFORMS done in this study . If this were practiced more fre - quently , decision makers could learn that the accuracy of a group’s judgment alone is often superior to the error - prone revision of their own beliefs . An archetypal example of this practice is the use of prediction or information markets . These allow inde - pendent individuals to place small bets on the occur - rence of political , economic , or sporting events ( e . g . , the Arizona Cardinals will win Super Bowl XLIII ) , where the market value of the trade reﬂects the col - lective assessment of the probability of the event’s occurrence . Organizations could use internal markets to help forecast product success , competitor actions , project timelines , and so forth . The lack of appreci - ation for this collective wisdom documented herein may be one reason information markets have failed to catch on inside organizations ( The Economist 2005 ) . 6 . Conclusion Milgram ( 1965 ) once commented that “Edifying effects of the group , although acknowledged , have rarely been demonstrated with the clarity and force of its destructive potential” ( p . 127 ) . Groups and teams have a mixed reputation in organizations in part due to these demonstrations . Yet he also suggested that “con - structive conformity” to a group can beneﬁt individ - uals , especially if the inﬂuence is informational . This is increasingly recognized in principle , but the inﬂu - ence of group judgments on behavior still indicates a shallow appreciation for the wisdom of crowds .
