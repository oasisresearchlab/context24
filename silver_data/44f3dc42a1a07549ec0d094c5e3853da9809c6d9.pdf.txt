COMMENTARY 2100 Journal of Investigative Dermatology ( 2007 ) , Volume 127 We now can return to the theme of bioengineering stem cells to form hair follicles . With the advent of stem cell biology , we anticipate that many attempts to engineer hair follicles will be made in the near future . The epider - mal stem cells or progenitor cells may derive from many sources : embryonic stem cells , engineered embryonic stem cells or cell lines , interfollicular epider - mal stem cells , bulge stem cells , or even bone marrow stem cells . Because the cells may have different competences , the “hair follicles” built with them may be different . In the future , we must ask whether they fulfill all the criteria of a bona fide hair follicle . Work that has had partial success is nonetheless valuable because it helps in the analysis of distinct events during hair - follicle morphogen - esis . The results here highlight the chal - lenge faced by all who aspire to engineer human organs , including hair follicles .

S . cases per year ) that now exceeds that of cutaneous T - cell lymphoma and a mortality ( 33 % ) exceeding that of melanoma . Despite this impact , little is known about its biology . Recent studies have shown that Ras / MAP kinase activity is absent and possibly detrimental to this cancer . This makes MCC distinct from other UV - induced skin cancers and highlights the question of what drives this malignancy .

The National Cancer Data Base , a registry that captures approximately 75 % of all cancer cases in the United States , recorded 986 cases of MCC in 2004 ( most recent data available ) . According to multiple national databases , there has been a 5 – 10 % annual increase in MCC diagnoses beginning in the early 1990s ( Agelli and Clegg , 2003 ; National Cancer Data Base data provided by Jerri Linn Phillips ) . Taking these factors into account , there are now approximately 1 , 500 cases of MCC per year in the United States . This exceeds the inci - dence of cutaneous T - cell lymphoma , a well - known and frequently studied can - cer , whose incidence has been stable since the early 1980s ( Weinstock and Gardstein , 1999 ) . MCC is also one of the most lethal skin cancers , with a 33 % mortality ( Hodgson , 2005 ) —it now kills more patients than cutaneous T - cell lymphoma and a number similar to that for chronic myelogenous leukemia ( Figure 1 ) ( American Cancer Society , 2006 ; Weinstock and Gardstein , 1999 ) . Despite the mortality and increasing incidence , virtually nothing is known about the molecular basis of MCC . Several studies of oncogenic pathways have been carried out in MCC but have not elucidated a significant role for these pathways in this cancer ( Table 1 ) . Van Gele et al . ( 2000 ) revealed a lack of p53 mutations in 12 of 15 cases of MCC . Three of the five p53 mutations found in three tumors were of the sig - nature UV type , consistent with MCC’s known association with UV exposure . The lack of p53 mutations in 80 % of MCCs , however , suggests that p53 is not typically involved in this cancer . The same group ( Van Gele et al . , 2001 ) also looked at the role of the tumor suppres - sor PTEN . Although loss of heterozygos - ity ( loss of one allele ) was seen in 9 of 21 cases ( mostly involving loss of the entire arm of chromosome 10 ) , only a single mutation was seen in the remain - ing allele of one MCC case . Thus , inacti - vation of PTEN ( by loss of one allele and disruption of the second ) does not play a frequent role in MCC oncogenesis . It is possible , however , that loss of a second PTEN allele would be via an epigenetic silencing mechanism such as methyla - tion , which has not been examined . The Wnt pathway and its role in MCC have also been evaluated by looking for nuclear accumulation of β - catenin and for mutations in β - catenin and three other related genes . In a series of 12 MCC cases , Liu et al . ( 2007 ) found elevated β - catenin accumulation in only one tumor and no mutations in any tumors and concluded that the Wnt pathway is not implicated in MCC . Several studies have reported on c - Kit expression in MCC tumor samples . Most recently , Swick et al . ( 2007 ) deter - mined that although eight of nine MCC tumors were positive for c - Kit by immu - nohistochemical staining , no activat - ing mutations were present in the four exons commonly found to have muta - tions in this gene . MAP kinase signaling , a common feature of many epithelial cancers , is the most studied oncogenic pathway in MCC ( Figure 2 ) . Popp et al . ( 2002 ) looked for activating mutations in exons 1 and 2 of the H - , K - , and N - ras genes in six MCC cell lines but found none . Figure 1 .

COMMENTARY 2102 Journal of Investigative Dermatology ( 2007 ) , Volume 127 Recently , Houben et al . ( 2006 ) evaluat - ed 46 MCC tumors for the characteristic activating B - Raf mutation ( V600E ) found in 43 % of melanomas , and all tumors were negative . Further , the authors showed that the MAP kinase pathway was silent ( no phospho - ERK staining ) in 42 of 44 cases , and Raf kinase inhibitor protein was increased in all 20 tumors evaluated . Taken together , the studies strongly suggest no role for MAP kinase pathway activation in MCC , a pathway heavily implicated in the etiology of melanoma , squamous cell carcinoma , and many other cancers ( Schubbert et al . , 2007 ) . The sole potentially positive finding in MCC is that of bcl - 2 . Its expression was seen in 15 of 20 MCC tumors in two stud - ies ( Kennedy et al . , 1996 ; Plettenberg et al . , 1996 ) . A separate study determined that decreasing bcl - 2 expression in vivo by systemic antisense oligonucleotide ( oblimersen / Genasense ) administration in a SCID mouse / human tumor xeno - graft model resulted in tumor shrinkage ( Schlagbauer - Wadl et al . , 2000 ) . The expression of this anti - apoptosis protein is a common finding in many cancers and suggests one of its mechanisms to avoid cell death ; however , it does not illuminate the promitotic pathways that drive MCC . In this issue of the Journal of Investigative Dermatology , Houben et al . ( 2007 ) expand on their findings noted above , that the MAP kinase path - way is silent in 42 of 44 MCC tumors . Using an MCC cell line ( UISO ) that , like primary tumors , shows no evidence of MAP kinase activity , they tested wheth - er activating this pathway could result in MCC cell death . Indeed , inducible expression of c - Raf - 1 kinase in the UISO MCC cell line resulted in morphologic changes and apoptosis . Rounding up and detachment of cells , development of long cytoplasmic extensions , and loss of actin stress fibers were seen begin - ning at 10 hours after activation of the pathway . Further , they demonstrated that active Raf kinase induced apopto - sis in UISO cells in a time - and dose - dependent manner . This appears to be via a classic apoptotic pathway because it was blocked by a caspase inhibitor ( Z - VAD - FMK ) . The fact that a MEK kinase inbibitor ( U0126 ) also blocked Raf’s ability to induce apoptosis suggests that the Raf effect is indeed mediated via the predicted MAP kinase pathway ( Houben et al . , 2007 ) . A limitation of the study is that it was performed in a single MCC cell line . Few reagents for MCC are available to study , and of the available cell lines , only one ( UISO ) had preservation of the MCC in vivo characteristic of silencing of the MAP kinase pathway . The lack of cell death observed in the study from Raf overexpression in other cell lines positive for MAP kinase activity ( three melanoma lines and two other MCC lines ) argues for some level of specific - ity for the cell - death effect to cells that are silent for MAP kinase activity . The striking lack of knowledge of what drives MCC oncogenesis is an important impediment because no effec - tive targeted therapies exist . Molecular therapies used in other malignancies are now being extended to clinical tri - als in MCC . Phase II trials of imatinib ( Gleevec ) and oblimersen ( Genasense ) are currently under way in MCC . The tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib , ini - tially designed to target the Bcr – Abl translocation in chronic myelogenous leukemia , is being explored because of the c - Kit positivity of MCC . Recent data from Swick et al . ( 2007 ) suggest that its effectiveness may be limited , however , given that no c - Kit - activating muta - tions were seen in their series . The bcl - 2 inhibitor oblimersen is also in a phase II trial for MCC , but no results of its effi - cacy in humans with MCC have been published . The present study by Houben et al . ( 2007 ) provides data for the possible use of MAP kinase pathway – activating agents in MCC . Use of the Raf - 1 activa - tor ZM336372 did indeed induce ERK phosphylation in UISO MCC cells that are normally silent for MAP kinase sig - naling . A separate study using carcinoid tumor cells ( another neuroendocrine carcinoma ) demonstrated that in vitro treatment with ZM336372 inhibited cel - lular proliferation ( Van Gompel et al . , 2005 ) . The data suggest that pharmaco - logic activation of this normally silent pathway is a potential target for treat - ment of certain neuroendocrine tumors . Even though we know essentially nothing about what promitotic signal - ing mechanisms drive MCC , there is a glimmer of hope that recent knowledge about what does not drive it may be brought to bear in the fight against MCC and , potentially , other neuroendocrine cancers .

Rünger 1 The carcinogenic properties of ultraviolet ( UV ) light are mediated by its ability to generate DNA damage . Cellular responses to UV - induced DNA damage pro - foundly modulate the carcinogenic effects of UV exposures , and these responses are wavelength dependent . However , the exact contributions of different wave - lengths of UV light to DNA damage , cellular damage responses , mutation , and skin carcinogenesis are incompletely understood . Given that UV - induced apop - tosis is a protective cellular response to UV that prevents survival of damaged cells , inhibition of UVB - induced apoptosis by adding UVA , as reported by Ibuki et al . in this issue , may be a mechanism by which UVA augments UVB - mediated mutation and skin cancer formation . Journal of Investigative Dermatology ( 2007 ) 127 , 2103 – 2105 . doi : 10 . 1038 / sj . jid . 5700988 Photocarcinogenesis is most common - ly thought to be the result of a chain of events that involve formation of DNA damage and subsequent mutation for - mation following exposure to ultra - violet light ( UV ) ( Figure 1 ) ( Rünger , 2003 ) . Several cellular defense mech - anisms reduce the likelihood that one occurrence in this cascade leads to the next ( Figure 1 ) . Many of these protec - tive responses can be induced by UV , thereby providing additional protec - tion against subsequent exposures . All of these responses are mediated by a tightly controlled network of signaling pathways , many of which involve the tumor suppressor p53 . UV - induced mutations of p53 with subsequent dis - ruption of cellular damage responses are a hallmark of most sun - induced cutaneous squamous - cell carcino - mas ( Brash et al . , 1996 ) . This further underlines the importance of these damage responses for the prevention of photocarcinogenesis . The melanin microparasol that cov - ers the nucleus of basal keratinocytes reduces formation of DNA damage with exposure of the skin to UV . Once DNA damage is formed , most of it is repaired and does not give rise to mutations . This is exemplified by the genodermatosis xeroderma pigmen - tosum , in which the relative inability to repair UV - induced DNA damage results in UV hypermutability in cells and an increased frequency of skin cancers in UV - exposed areas of affect - ed patients . Another mechanism that inhibits mutation formation at sites of DNA damage is a G1 / S cell – cycle arrest that prevents cells from rep - licating damaged DNA , a situation particularly prone to the introduction of mutations ( Decraene et al . , 2001 ) .
