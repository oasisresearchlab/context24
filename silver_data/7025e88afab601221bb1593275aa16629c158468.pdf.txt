ENDOCYTOSIS MECHANISM OF POLY - AND LIPOPLEXES IN SIRNA DELIVERY IN HELA CELLS BY MIHAEL LAZEBNIK THESIS Submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Chemical Engineering in the Graduate College of the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign , 2012 Urbana , Illinois Advisor : Professor Daniel W . Pack ii ABSTRACT RNA interference ( RNAi ) is a method that can be used to treat various medical conditions . This method can silence expression of virtually any gene , and it is initiated by small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) molecule . siRNA is a 19 nucleotides - long double stranded RNA - molecule . In order to begin gene silencing , siRNA needs to be delivered to the cytosol . The first of the barriers that stand on the path of the siRNA delivery is endocytosis . Endocytosis is a process by which nutrients , signals and pathogens enter the cells . This process consists of multiple pathways that lead the objects that were ingested by the cells to different intracellular destinations . The chemical environment encountered by the endocytosed objects also depends on the specific pathways . Because of the large size , negative charge and other chemical properties , siRNA cannot readily enter the cells . One of the most promising techniques to deliver siRNA is to employ its anionic property to electrostatically complex it with cationic lipids or polymers and create lipid - or polymer based particles ( lipoplexes or polyplexes ) . The materials that are used as the delivery vectors can mediate the uptake and the release of siRNA in the cytosol . In order to synthesize newer generation of the delivery materials , it is paramount to know through which endocytosis pathways the current materials deliver their cargo and which limitations they encounter . In the study presented here , two representatives of the siRNA delivery vectors were chosen , and the investigation into their endocytosis in HeLa cells was performed . Chemical and biological ( RNAi ) methods were used to selectively inhibit endocytosis pathways and investigate the influence of inhibition on total uptake of and RNAi mediated by polyplexes and lipoplexes . Fluorescence microscopy was also used to determine the predominant pathways in the siRNA delivery by two different materials . The experiments revealed that polyplexes enter the cells through multiple endocytosis pathways simultaneously , and the expression of the delivered siRNA is the most prominent when polyplexes enter through caveolin - , flotillin - and ARF6 - mediated endocytosis pathways . ARF6 might play multiple roles in the delivery and release of the delivered siRNA in cells . Lipoplexes , on the other hand , enter the cells and release siRNA through a method of direct fusion with the plasma membrane rather than endocytosis . The data and conclusions presented in this study are consistent with the current knowledge and expand on the understanding of the complicated endocytosis mechanisms of siRNA - based particles . iii ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I would like to thank my parents for investing much of their lives in my education and my character .

Efficient delivery of genetic material or oligonucleotides can either restore lost function to the cells or provide regulation to various functions of the cells . Several possible targets for such therapy have been proposed . For example , p53 is a well - known protein that is a product of the TP53 gene and is a target for cancer gene therapy . P53 is responsible for cell cycle regulation and arrests DNA replication if the DNA is damaged . Since it was discovered in 1979 TP53 was thought to be an oncogene , but as more and more studies were done it was reclassified into protooncogene . 1 This means that the mutation of TP53 is what causes an uncontrolled division of cells . Since the mutation or loss of TP53 has been identified as the most common single genetic trait in many cancers , the restoration of its function could bring a revolutionary treatment in cancer therapy . Cancer is not the only field that can benefit from genetic engineering . Several targets for genetic engineering were identified and are currently explored in clinical trials of cardiovascular therapy . Patients with chronic lower limb ischemia can greatly benefit from additional vascular endothelial factor expression that was found to increase vasculature and reduce amputation rates . 2 The delivery of genetic material that codes for nitric oxide synthase protein into porcine blood vessels was able to increase the synthesis of nitric oxide that can reduce negative postsurgical response of endothelial cells . 3 The restoration of the lost function of genes is not the only benefit that genetic engineering can provide . The discovery of a powerful regulatory mechanism of RNA interference ( RNAi ) in 1991 4 and the discovery of one of the main mediators of this process ( small interfering RNA ) 10 years later 5 opened new possibilities of down regulation or almost complete elimination of aberrant genes . Just like the addition of genetic material , the suppression of expression of certain genes can provide an immense therapeutic potential . In analogy to previous examples , some sequences of small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) can induce apoptosis . A successful delivery strategy of such siRNA was shown to be effective in reducing tumors in vivo and in vitro . 6 Restenosis is a common condition that is triggered by inflammation resulting by oxidative stress of patients that have undergone arterial interventions . Successfully induced RNAi targeting an oxidase protein in blood vessels of rats has been shown to dramatically reduce 2 restenosis without any significant side effects . 7 This means that RNAi can be used to treat many of the conditions that were envisioned for the more conventional DNA - based gene therapy . In some cases , RNAi treatment could be easier and safer to implement than DNA - treatment . As described later ( Sec . 2 . 1 ) , RNAi can be initiated by siRNA that is delivered to the cytosol , while in the DNA - therapy the molecule needs to be delivered to the cellular nucleus . This means that there are potentially less obstacles to RNAi therapy . RNAi can either be initiated by direct delivery of siRNA into the cytosol or by delivery of a plasmid DNA that ultimately codes for the siRNA production . When the first method is implemented , the response is usually transient , but when the second method is used , then the RNAi can be permanently induced ( Sec . 2 . 4 ) . Some researchers claim that the delivery of synthetically produced siRNA is not a viable option for many in vivo applications , because the effect is not long lasting enough for the treatment . 8 However , recent studies indicate that permanent expression of siRNA can be highly toxic . 9 So the transient therapy initiated by direct delivery of siRNA can be a much safer option . It can also provide for a higher degree of control over the dosage , and allow the therapist to adjust the amounts of delivered siRNA based on the response from the patient or even halt the treatment when required . In addition , when appropriate delivery methods are implemented , the effects of siRNA therapy were demonstrated to last for over 11 days in non - human primates . 10 Such options would certainly be an important factor in the approval of the procedure by regulatory agencies . Currently there are no USFDA approved gene therapy products , 11 but many clinical trials for such therapies are in progress . 12 , 13 The first stage III RNAi - trial involved the treatment of wet age - related macular degeneration . The disease is caused by excessive growth of blood vessels that cause detachment of the retina . The growth of the blood vessels can be limited by RNAi - mediated inhibition of the VEGF protein . However , the trials had to be stopped as a result of either wrong choice of the target protein or insufficient RNAi efficiency . 14 The company is currently considering the usage of delivery vectors , since their initial attempt involved the delivery of “naked” siRNA . 13 The advancements in gene sequencing and analysis of large data sets have greatly increased our understanding of possible targets of gene delivery . Yet , this knowledge was not translated into practical applications mainly due to lack of vectors that are capable of delivery of 3 biological therapeutic agents into the target cells in a safe and controlled manner . The development of such vectors should be based on design that will emerge from better understanding of processes that govern the transport of the therapeutic molecules into the cells . One of the main barriers on route to the target destination is the uptake step . It is widely accepted that cells internalize particles from the surrounding through endocytosis . 15 This process is highly complex and involves multiple pathways that act simultaneously . The uptake through each of the pathways leads to different intracellular destinations . It is paramount to have the knowledge of the predominant pathways and conditions that are imposed on the particles that undergo uptake into the cells in order to make this process more efficient and controlled . In the study presented here , we have chosen two vectors that are common to gene delivery and investigated the biology of their uptake and subsequent processing using multiple tools . 4 CHAPTER 2 : BACKGROUND 2 . 1 RNAi : a post - transcriptional regulation mechanism RNA interference is a post transcriptional gene silencing mechanism that might be initiated by different means . 16 Both the small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) and micro RNA ( miRNA ) can regulate gene expression by either triggering an endonuclease cleavage or by increase of the decapping ( removal of special stabilizing nucleotide on the 5’ - end ) rates of mRNA . The two molecules present similar functions , but they are distinguished by their origin . 17 , 18 Just like the siRNA , miRNA is a small molecule ( 19 - 22 nucleotides long ) . However , miRNA is an endogenous single stranded product of cells that is processed by Dicer from structures that contain a hairpin structure . 19 siRNA is most commonly delivered to cells exogenously , but they can also be produced by endogenously produced or exogenously delivered double stranded RNAs ( dsRNA ) . Both of these small molecules share most of the RNAi protein machinery . The specific structure of siRNA is a 19 nucleotide duplex with two - nucleotide overhangs on both 3’ ends ( Fig . 2 . 1 ) . 13 One of the strands is called the passenger strand and the other is called the guide strand . The sequence of the guide strand is complimentary to a portion of mRNA sequence to be cleaved . RNAi is an ATP - dependent mechanism that requires siRNA to have 5’ phosphate . 20 If exogenously delivered , siRNA is phosphorylated by hClp1 protein and can be further used in RNAi as if it were endogenous . 21 In human cells , the most essential and the minimal components that initiate RNAi are siRNA and argonaute2 protein . 22 The combination of these two components is called an active RISC ( RNA - induced silencing complex ) that is capable of inducing cleavage of target mRNA at their center . 13 One of the functions of argonaute2 protein is to unwind the dsRNA and load only 3’ 3’ 5’ 5’ Figure 2 . 1 : The structure of siRNA duplex 5 the antisense ( guide ) strand in the cytosol . Other proteins ( TRBP , PACT and C3PO ) also participate in RNAi , but their functional roles are still not completely known . 13 However , attempts to reconstruct the RISC machinery in vitro were proved to be successful , 23 so the mechanistic biology of the process will eventually be precisely elucidated . The active RISC complex is known to degrade mRNAs in a highly specific manner . A single mismatch in the nucleotide sequence between loaded siRNA and target mRNA can reduce RNAi efficacy by 30 % while more than one nucleotide mismatch essentially stops the process . 24 It has been determined that some of the mismatches are better tolerated , and the drop in the RNAi efficiency after a mismatch depends on both the location of the nucleotides and nucleotides’ chemistry . 25 Because of the complexity of the RNAi and many target opportunities , the selection of the siRNA for specific targets is an active research topic . Several large studies were performed that correlate siRNA sequence with the RNAi activity in large databases 26 , 27 and with complex thermodynamic analysis . 28 The criteria that should be taken into account when selecting siRNA include the stability of the active RISC , selection of the proper strand for guidance and immunogenicity 29 . The selection of the passenger strand by RISC as a guide strand can not only reduce the efficiency of RNAi but also introduce an off - target effect . To prevent this , there is a need to introduce siRNA “asymmetry . ” 30 Asymmetry of siRNA is a quality that is based on thermodynamics and ensures that only the guide strand is incorporated in RISC . It is now known that asymmetry is enhanced when the 5’ end of the antisense strand is enriched with A - U base pairs 13 . The choice of targeted mRNA is also important , since various secondary structures can reduce the efficiency of RNAi . 31 , 32 In addition , for a potential of inducing cytotoxicity due to the excessive hijacking of the native RNAi machinery , siRNA can also induce an inflammatory response due to specialized receptors that exist on the immune system cells . 13 , 33 , 34 Statistical tools to predict the most suitable siRNA for the selected targets are reviewed elsewhere . 27 , 35 2 . 2 Delivery barriers As described above , one of the ways to initiate RNAi is to deliver siRNA to the cytosol . However , such a task is not trivial , since siRNA is a large , anionic and fragile molecule that cannot readily cross cellular membranes . Simple intravenous injection of “naked” siRNA is not a 6 feasible delivery option , since siRNA is attacked by RNAse and other blood proteins and is cleared from the system in a matter of minutes . 36 – 38 The delivery barriers that are also known from the better explored pDNA delivery studies 39 – 41 include two sets : extracellular and intracellular . In brief , upon the entry into a body , the delivered molecule should evade the immune system , survive the rheological stress ( intravenous injection ) , recognize and attach itself to the cells that are the focus of the specific therapy , be internalized by the cells and , finally , be delivered to the intracellular destination without being degraded . But they apply to the siRNA delivery only to some extent as a consequence of several reasons . First is that while it is usually desired to deliver pDNA to the nucleus , the siRNA has to be delivered to the cytosol . Second , the sizes of the DNA - particles usually differ from the ones that are formed with siRNA as a result of pDNA being larger molecules that can easily deform and be “condensed” by delivery vectors ( more on them below ) and siRNA behaving more like rigid - rod molecules . 42 , 43 The degradation of the delivered molecules can also be described as a delivery barrier , and since siRNA contains extra hydroxyl group , compared to DNA , it is more prone to degradation by nucleases in serum that digest along phosphodiester backbone . 43 As a result , there is a need for a delivery vector that will mediate the passage of siRNA through the barriers while keeping it intact , and release siRNA into the cytosol . Since eventually the materials that will mediate siRNA delivery will differ from the materials used for pDNA - delivery , it is natural to assume that different delivery barriers will be posed for these molecules . 2 . 3 Biological mechanisms of endocytosis Endocytosis is one of the main barriers that siRNA needs to overcome before it can initiate a therapeutic effect . Since this complicated process is investigated by researchers from multiple fields , it is worthwhile to initially review it from purely biological prospective ( discussed here ) and then to review its implications on the siRNA delivery ( Sec . 2 . 5 ) . Endocytosis is a process that describes de novo production of internal membranes from the plasma membrane lipid bilayer . 44 Such process is essential to all cells , since cells continuously use it to obtain their nutrients , exchange signals , regulate amounts of receptors and probe the environment . The process of the uptake of the membrane is counterbalanced with the recycling activity back to the plasma membrane , and it is estimated that every hour the cells can internalize 1 to 5 equivalents of their surface . 45 7 Endocytosis consists of multiple uptake pathways . Thus , there have been several attempts to classify these pathways into groups ; however these attempts have largely been unsuccessful , since not all of the pathways have already been discovered , and the research of the biology of the known pathways is still an ongoing topic . The separate pathways are known either by the type of cargo that they let cells internalize ( e . g . macropinocytosis ) , by the proteins that are associated with the pathways ( e . g . clathrin - mediated endocytosis ) or by the proteins that are known not to be associated with the pathways ( e . g . clathrin - independent endocytosis ) . The common characteristic of these pathways is that they form vesicles at the plasma membrane that invaginate into the cells . These vesicles ( endosomes ) have different fates that depend on the endocytosis pathway that promoted their formation and on their cargo . Macropinocytosis ( MPE ) is among the earliest discovered pathways 46 and is characterized by the formation of large ( 0 . 2 - 10 µm in diameter ) 47 vesicles that are called macropinosomes . These vesicles are formed from the ruffling of the plasma membrane . Even though this pathway does not discriminate against the cargo , it has now become clear that it is highly regulated . The pathway is known to depend on a large number of proteins : Rac , Pak1 , Cdc42 , CtBP1 / BARS , ARF6 . The process is mostly driven by actin , and is usually activated by growth factors , however , it is also found to be highly active in cancer and immune system cells . 48 – 50 The pathway is commonly inhibited by Na + / H + - inhibitors such as amiloride or derivatives of the drug ; only recently it has been discovered that these inhibitors act by lowering submembraneous pH which leads to prevention of activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 proteins . 51 Amiloride is such a specific marker for MPE , that it was suggested to define this pathway as one that is suppressed by amiloride , stimulated by growth factor and has morphology of large vesicles . 48 MPE also depends on the cholesterol content of the plasma membrane , since cholesterol appears to be required for the localization of Rac1 on the plasma membrane . 52 The fate of the macropinosomes seems to depend on the type of the cells . For example , macropinosomes were found to fuse with acidic late endosomes and lysosomes in macrophages and kidney cells but remain separated from endolysosomal system and recycle back to plasma membrane in A - 431 and NIH - 3T3 cells . Macropinosomes are also more leaky compared to other types of endocytic vesicles . 48 , 53 8 Clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) is one of the most studied and well described pathways . The term “receptor - mediated endocytosis” was synonymously used with the term “CME” for a very long time . It is such an important pathway , that it is expected that around half of the internalization by fibroblastic cells is done through CME , 44 and many of the contemporary review articles are concentrated on clathrin - independent pathways as opposed to CME . The formation of clathrin cage around the invaginations at the plasma membrane was first demonstrated and confirmed in 1996 . 54 This cage is characteristic to this pathway , but its formation is only one of the five main steps in CME that were exhaustively reviewed recently . 55 First , a putative nucleation module that contains FCHO proteins , EGFR - pathway substrate and intersectins is formed on the plasma membrane . Highly conserved adapter 2 ( AP2 ) proteins along with other numerous cargo - specific adapter proteins are then recruited . A wide range of these adapter proteins along with different receptors have been identified in various cells . These proteins also give CME the ability to endocytose multiple different cargoes . The various adapter proteins always bind to the AP2 , and AP2 then recruits clathrin triscelia directly from cytosol while simultaneously binding to the cargo . Since clathrin binds to a flexible region of adapter proteins , it has been thought that some other membrane curvature effectors are required in order to create a pit in the plasma membrane . The mechanochemical enzyme called dynamin undergoes GTP hydrolysis - driven conformational change at the “neck” of the formed vesicle , and the vesicle is cut from the plasma membrane . The location on the vesicle where it buds off the membrane remains not covered with clathrin cage , and it is hypothesized that two proteins ( HSC70 and auxilin ) disassemble the clathrin cage starting at that location shortly after the budding event . 55 Scores of different adapter proteins have been identified in the CME . These proteins can recruit various receptors allowing CME to be one of the most versatile pathways . Caveolin - mediated endocytosis ( CvME ) originates from flask like structures of 50 - 100 nm on the plasma membranes that are thought to be associated with lipid rafts . Such structures are named caveolae and have a coat that contains 100 - 200 caveolin - 1 proteins per caveola . 44 Caveolin - 1 proteins assemble on the plasma membrane by direct binding to cholesterol . The caveolar pathway is associated with the uptake of multiple ligands that include albumin , autocrine motility factor , tetanus toxin , cholera toxin and multiple types of viruses . 49 The invagination of caveolae that forms vesicles termed caveosomes is poorly understood and is a subject to controversy . 50 Electron microscopy of fixed structures and fluorescence microscopy 9 revealed that caveolae structures on plasma membranes are immobilized and do not enter the cytosol . They form long tubular structures that go deep inside the cells , and caveolin - 1 structures are generally very stable . 56 Calls have even been made to abandon the term “caveosome , ” and significant evidence suggests that caveosomes are actually late endosomes that contain large amounts of caveolin - 1 proteins “awaiting degradation . ” 57 Other investigations revealed caveolin - 1 - positive structures bud from the plasma membrane , but these events are very rare . 58 Nevertheless , caveolin - 1 protein is found to be associated with other less known pathways such as CLIC / GEEC ( more on it below ) , and the investigation of CvME can lead to important discoveries . 44 It is important to note that it is widely accepted that endosomes that are associated with CvME are not acidified and travel to Golgi and / or ER as opposed to endosomes that are associated with CME that rapidly acidify and degrade their cargo in lysosomes . 59 , 60 Flotillin - mediated endocytosis ( FME ) is a relatively novel pathway that has yet to be explored in depth . Flotillin - 1 is a protein that is homologous to caveolin - 1 44 , however it was found in plasma membrane domains distinct from caveolae and thought to form a major pathway in mammalian cells . 61 Flotillin - 1 was found to be necessary for dynamin - dependent but caveolin - 1 and chlathrin - independent uptake of negatively charged plasma membrane proteoglycans that end up in late endosomes in HeLa cells . 62 The FME pathway may be also responsible for fluid - phase uptake in HeLa cells , since many flotillin - positive structures were found to be co - localized with dextran ( a fluid phase marker ) that is also used for MPE investigations . 49 , 61 ARF6 - dependent endocytosis is a pathway that is associated with formed vesicles that contain ARF6 protein . 44 ARF6 is one of the many members of the ADP ribosylation factor family of GTP - binding proteins that has multiple roles including influence on membrane trafficking , actin skeleton structure at plasma membrane , and membrane lipid modification . 63 ARF6 can act as a regulator of recycling to the plasma membranes 44 or as a protein that is directly involved in endocytosis , since it was found to be characteristic to endosomes that are clathrin and dynamin - independent and separate from CLIC / GEEC structures . Because these endosomes appear to communicate with transferrin - containing vesicles that are associated with CME , the role of ARF6 that is also contained in specialized tubular recycling membranes 44 , 49 , 63 in endocytosis is difficult to investigate . Significant evidence suggests that at least in some cell types ARF6 acts more as a CME regulator than an independent pathway regulator . Specifically , ARF6 interacts with AP2 in HeLa cells and promotes clathrin recruitment and regulates uptake 10 of G - protein coupled receptors by CME in HEK293 cells . 56 ARF6 can either be directly involved in formation of endosomes or be incorporated later in the recycling step . 49 The list of cargo that can be internalized through an ARF6 - dependent pathway include β1 - integrin , M2 muscarinic receptor and some GPI - anchored proteins . The vesicles formed from ARF6 uptake fuse with early endosomes and traffic to lysosomes or recycle to plasma membrane through tubular structures . 41 Reduction of ARF6 content in retinal pigment epithelial cells ( ARPE - 19 ) using RNAi inhibited the uptake of MPE markers and did not alter the uptake of transferrin ( CME marker ) indicating the importance of ARF6 in MPE . 64 Only the active form of ARF6 ( ARF6 - GDP ) is required for the recycling pathway ; the inactive ARF6 ( ARF6 - GTP ) is associated with direct endocytosis . 45 Aside from other endocytosis pathways that are characteristic to specialized cells ( e . g . phagocytosis by phagocytes ) there exist several other pathways associated with complex biological mechanisms that are still not completely clear . CLIC / GEEC pathway characterizes clathrin - and dynamin - independent endosomal compartments enriched with GPI - AP proteins that do not have cytosolic extentions . 49 The vesicles that are formed in this pathway are tubular in their shape , form special early endosomal compartments and do not travel to Golgi . CLIC / GEEC is responsible for fluid - phase uptake , and it is heavily dependent on cholesterol . 65 , 66 Another example of such a pathway is characterized by the tetraspanin CD58 - enriched domains . This pathway is not dependent on clathrin , caveolin , flotillin or dynamin ; it is also not disturbed by cholesterol depletion and is similar to the GEEC pathway . 49 , 67 , 68 Several other pathways exist , but their biological mechanisms have yet to be determined . 49 The vesicles that are formed in these different endocytosis processes have different surfaces , lumina and physico - chemical properties that allow them to process the cargo in various ways . After uptake , the vesicles that formed from many of the pathways are sorted and delivered to different intracellular destinations . 69 The elucidation of the sorting and delivery of the vesicles is still not clear . However it is evident that the formed vesicles preserve the “memory” of their origin using protein or lipid markers . 55 This is because although most of the vesicles formed from the above described pathways become early endosomes 15 , these endosomes are destined for different intracellular destinations . The traffic of endosomes and the exit from them are termed “retrograde transport” and “retrograde sorting . ” 70 Numerous molecules on the endosomes are known to act as keys for locks that are located on various intracellular 11 destinations such as Golgi , ER , and lysosome . These tethering proteins in turn serve as connectors between Rab and SNARE proteins . 15 Rab - family proteins consist of over 60 molecules that act as switches in the intracellular processes . They are implicated in un - coating and movement of vesicles , and fusion between endosomes and their recipients . For example , Rab5 is implicated in movement of clathrin - coated vesicles into early endosomes , while Rab9 with late endosome to Golgi ; Rab25 is a marker of recycling endosomes destined for exocytosis . One of the most complete reviews of Rab GTPases was published by Stenmark in 2009 . 71 It is important to study the intracellular trafficking because the design of the delivery vectors should be based on the conditions that the vectors experience during the delivery process . Also , the design of the delivery vector can influence the endocytosis pathway that the particles will use to enter the cells and reach their ultimate destination . 2 . 4 Delivery vectors As a result of the delivery barriers that were described above , there is a need for siRNA vectors capable of assisting siRNA to initiate RNAi There are two main classes of vectors that are employed in gene delivery . Viruses are most commonly used for the delivery of genetic material . They are much more efficient than other vectors and are employed in many of the clinical trials . Three important types of viruses that are used include adenoviruses , adeno - Macropinocytosis Caveolin - mediated Clathrin - mediated Flotillin - mediated ARF6 - dependent ? ? ? • Large structures of ruffled membrane • No protein coat • Cholesterol dependent • Best studied with scores of proteins identified in the process • Acidic • Associated with cholesterol • Not acidic • Known to form vesicles that travel to Golgi and ER • Homologous to Caveolin ( associated with lipid - domains ) • The pathway is unclear • Can be directly implicated or regulatory • Regulate recycling • Regulate membrane ruffling Figure 2 . 2 : Summary of some of the endocytosis pathways ; some of the properties are known , but lots of biology is yet to be explored 12 associated viruses and retroviruses . 13 The first two types can deliver DNA , and some modifications to the adeno - associated viruses can make them very promising in long - term treatments . 72 However , retroviruses are more commonly used , deliver RNA , and use integration to incorporate their code in host’s genome . The main benefit of viruses is that they are capable of inducing long term expressions . Viruses have been evolving for millions of years , which made them very efficient but also well recognized by mammalian immune systems . Many of them are immunogenic and as a result were fatal in clinical trials . 73 , 74 It is believed that RNAi was developed in order to provide protection of cells from expression of foreign ( viral ) RNA . 5 Viral therapy can also induce cancer , mainly because of inability to control the location where the viral DNA is integrated . 75 As for RNAi , viruses can be used to efficiently integrate shRNA expression cassettes . In fact , such treatment proved to be fatal to mice due to oversaturation of RNAi pathway caused by overexpression of shRNA delivered using adeno - associated virus . 9 As a result of all the drawbacks with viral vectors , there is a need in development of alternative means of delivery . Non - viral delivery systems are well known from the more mature DNA - delivery research . 39 , 41 , 76 The ideal requirement for these vectors is to deliver the material to the target cell nucleus through all of barriers without having any of the drawbacks of the viral systems . Fortunately , at least two classes of materials are known to be able to electrostatically bind to the DNA or siRNA and successfully mediate the delivery . These materials include lipids and polymers . Cationic lipids are known to bind siRNA or pDNA and form particles that are called lipoplexes . The first published study to utilize a synthetic cationic lipid for gene delivery was published in 1987 . 77 N - [ 1 - ( 2 , 3 - dioleyloxy ) propyl ] - N , N , N - trimethylammonium chloride ( DOTMA ) was used to deliver DNA in vitro . Since then DOTMA was also used in mRNA and siRNA delivery . 78 , 79 Next generation of now commonly used lipid was N - [ 1 - ( 2 , 3 - Dioleoyloxy ) propyl ] - N , N , N - trimethylammonium methyl - sulfate ( DOTAP ) ( Fig . 2 . 3 ) . 80 More recently , a large library of 700 cationic lipids was assembled to investigate the relationship between their structure and ability to mediate RNAi in siRNA delivery . 81 Their conclusion was that lipids that contain more than two amines per head unit , and two long or several small amide tails were the most effective . Based on their earlier data , they synthesized another lipid library 13 that was tested on HeLa , and the best performing lipids contained amide linkages , more than two alkyl tails , tail in range of 8 - 12 carbons and one tail short of total substitution of the amine reactants . In addition to using single lipid as a vector , some studies demonstrate that a mixture of different lipids can be used to significantly enhance transfections . For example , in in vitro pDNA - delivery study using DOTAP no transfections could be achieved when the serum levels were up to 80 % , but the addition of cholesterol improved the cell binding and uptake mechanisms to significant levels . 82 Other studies demonstrated the importance of incorporating cholesterol as a helper lipid in vivo . 83 , 84 85 Dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine ( DOPE ) is another helper lipid ( Fig . 2 . 3 ) that is used to promote delivery . 8484 , 86 It is hypothesized that DOPE facilitates the release of the delivered material by changing its phase from bilayer to hexagonal structure . 87 DOPE can also help in disassembly of the nucleic acid - particle once the particle is inside of the cell , all of which may be a result of the pH - sensitivity of DOPE . 84 , 86 The research presented here employed the properties of the above presented lipids in construction of a delivery reagent that consists of DOPE , DOTAP and cholesterol that was optimized for siRNA delivery . Because of the popularity of these materials , the constructed vector will act as a typical representative of the entire class of the lipid vectors . Cationic polymers are another class of materials that can electrostatically bind negatively charged siRNA or DNA and act as delivery agents . 79 The common feature of many of these polymers is their ability to self - assemble into nanoparticles when mixed with DNA or siRNA in solutions . Such particles are often called polyplexes . Examples of these materials include Polyethylenimine ( PEI ) , chitosan , and dendrimers such as poly ( amidoamine ) ( PAMAM ) . Just like with lipids , most of these polymers were initially used for DNA - delivery and now have been explored for RNAi applications . PAMAM are dendrimers that have primary amine groups on their surface and tertiary amine groups inside of their structures . Not only have they been used for successful DNA delivery 88 , but it has been shown that their partial degradation can lead to significant increase in their efficiency . 89 A study was performed that investigated the binding of siRNA to different generations of PAMAM using computational approach that was experimentally verified . 90 The study found that lower generations ( G4 ) of PAMAM adapt better to siRNA , while higher generations ( G6 ) act more like “rigid spheres . ” Interestingly , the studies that characterized PAMAM as a siRNA delivery agent in vitro found higher generations of 14 PAMAM to be more efficient in inducing RNAi than lower generations . 91 , 92 This might provide an insight in the relationship between the structure and the function of the polymers . PEI is one of the best studied delivery vectors . 39 , 76 , 79 It is one of the “off the shelf” polymers that is highly efficient in both DNA and siRNA deliveries . Every third atom in the PEI backbone is a protonatable nitrogen ( Fig . 2 . 3A ) . PEI has a high charge density and can bind to siRNA well . In addition , this gives PEI a high buffering capacity that facilitates the escape from the subcellular endosomes that is explained as a “protone - sponge” mechanism 93 , 94 ( discussed below ) . Unfortunately , PEI is too toxic to be used as a therapeutic agent , even though it has been used successfully in some in vivo studies . 95 It causes toxicity in two stages by disrupting plasma membrane and initiating mitochondrially mediated apoptotic program in human cell lines . 96 PEI is commercially available at a very wide range of molecular weights . It has been extensively modified by changing core structure and addition of various targeting molecules . 79 As an siRNA delivery agent , PEI could protect the delivered siRNA cargo in mice and mediated cancer treatment . 97 Because of its wide usage and great potential , we have chosen to further investigate its properties as a model cationic delivery polymer in the study presented here . Overall , the presently explored non - viral delivery agents cannot compete with the efficiency of the viral vectors . However , once the mechanisms by which they mediate RNAi will be fully explored , the road for the synthesis of novel materials that will be at least as efficient as the viruses without most of the drawbacks will be open . 15 2 . 5 Endocytosis in the context of siRNA delivery The ultimate goal of a siRNA delivery vector is to release siRNA molecules in the cytosol . After uptake into the cells , siRNA release could be accomplished in several locations . Juliano et al . predicted some of these locations . 15 It is presumed that to gain access to cytosol , the particles need to enter the trans - Golgi just like many viruses and pathogens operate . However , this might not be an important step in the siRNA delivery , and there is no need for precisely addressed delivery in RNAi . As the endosomes travel through the cells they constantly fuse with each other and with other lipid - based membranes . Early endosomes mature to late endosomes , late endosomes bud small vesicles for recycling back to plasma membrane , and fusion with lysosomes is also common . 45 The fusion events include the formation of non - bilayer domains that are inherently leakier than the bilayer domains . 98 , 99 This means that the relationship between the induced RNAi and leakage from the endomembrane compartments can be established . 15 A more conventional mechanism that is hypothesized to release the delivered particles from endosomes is called the “proton sponge” hypothesis . As the endosomes mature , their internal environment becomes more and more acidic by the action of ATPases . If the internal space of the endosome is buffered , then the counterions that enter the vesicle together with protons can cause the endosome to swell and eventually rupture , releasing the contents into Figure 2 . 3 : The materials that were used in the study . A . DOTAP is a cationic lipid capable of binding to anionic backbone of DNA or siRNA and promote the uptake . B . DOPE is a zwiterionic lipid that helps with the escape from the endosomes . C . Cholesterol helps stabilize the particle solution improve uptake to the cells . D . Branched PEI is a cationic polymer that was used as a model for the class of such materials in siRNA delivery . A B D C 16 cytosol . Such delivery strategy relies on the buffering capacity of the delivery vector , and cationic polymers such as PEI are known to provide that . 39 Two investigations into the endocytosis of oligonucleotides - based particles revealed interesting facts . Lu and coworkers used a commercially available lipid - based siRNA transfection reagent ( DharmaFECT1 ) in various cell lines and determined that although 95 % of particles enter cells through endocytosis , the inhibition of CME , CvME , MPE and lipid - raft mediated endocytosis did not lead to reduction in RNAi . The depletion of cholesterol from the plasma membrane did not alter the uptake of the lipoplexes , but the functional delivery was reduced . Low temperatures during transfections also inhibited RNAi . The authors concluded that a new mechanism of direct fusion between the lipoplexes and plasma membranes is likely to be responsible for functional siRNA delivery . 100 Another study investigated intracellular trafficking of antisense oligonucleotide that only expressed when delivered to nucleus ( splice shifting oligonucleotide ) using two commercially available delivery reagents : jetPEI ( derivative of linear PEI ) and Lipofectamine2k ( combination of DOSPA and DOPE ) . They concluded that the functional delivery using lipid - based system occurred through direct fusion with plasma membrane , and PEI - based delivery happened through a dynamin and caveolin - independent pathway that is also not CME . 101 Both of the studies discussed the possibilities of new endocytosis pathways that can mediate siRNA - delivery that were not active in the DNA - delivery . 2 . 6 Methods and tools to investigate endocytosis The methods to study the endocytosis of particles can roughly be divided into three categories . The first is the most direct method where either the delivered cargo or the vector ( or both ) are tagged with a fluorescent marker . The particles are then delivered to cells together with various markers ( e . g . dextran for fluid uptake or LysoTracker ( Molecular Probes ) for lysosomes ) . It is also common to fix the cells after the delivery and perform immunofluorescent staining of proteins of interest . The visualization can be done by confocal microscopy , and co - localization ( or its lack ) between the delivered particles and stained molecules can directly hint on the intracellular fate of the particles . 102 The drawback of this method could be the incorporation of small amounts of proteins into vesicles that are involved in pathways that are not directly associated with them . Also , the stained proteins might not even be inside of the 17 vesicles but be shuttled from the locations where they were manufactured or be recruited for other functions . This might lead to false conclusions when reviewing the co - localization data . The second set of methods includes various genetic modifications of the investigated cells . The cells can be modified to express a non - functional protein that will interfere with one of the pathways . For example , cells that express mutant dynamin can be compared with cells that express regular dynamin to investigate the uptake and the efficient transfection pathways that involve dynamin . Similar modifications can be done with caveolin and other proteins . 101 RNAi can also be used as an investigative tool . The proteins that mediate endocytosis pathways can be knocked out in a highly specific way . Recently , FME was implicated in polyplex delivery of DNA . Other tools could not be used , since there are no known markers for FME . 64 Our group also used RNAi in the past to determine that CvME is the predominant pathway in PEI / DNA delivery in HeLa cells . 103 Using cells that permanently express mutant proteins might not be as good of a method as using RNAi , since the mutant protein can affect other functions of the cells , while transient effect of RNAi might have fewer side effects . Since siRNA should be delivered with a vector to induce RNAi , it is also possible that the vector that is used will mildly influence the biology of the cell . Some other possible non - specific effects of siRNA were discussed above . The third set of methods involves the chemical inhibitors that are commonly used to selectively block one of the pathways . 53 , 104 The usage of drugs is the most popular method of studying endocytosis pathways , however this method has the biggest number of drawbacks and should be very carefully applied . 105 The in vitro protocol of using the drugs usually involves a short ( up to an hour ) pre - incubation of drugs in well plates with cells prior to transfections . Then the solution of transfecting particles is added to the cells , and the transfection occurs in the presence of the drugs . The media is then changed at the end of the transfection to a usual culture media . However , the drugs that are commonly used to disrupt a specific pathway are not as specific as usually claimed . For example , methyl - β - cyclodextrin ( mβCD ) is routinely used to inhibit CvME by depleting plasma membranes of cholesterol . 53 , 106 However , as was described before , cholesterol is an essential component of ME and FME . In a paper published in 1998 it was shown that the extraction of cholesterol by mβCD can also inhibit CME by perturbation of the formation of clathrin - coated vesicles . 107 Another example is a commonly used cationic amphiphilic drug chlorpromazine that is used as a CME inhibitor by preventing the dissociation 18 of clathrin lattice 53 by relocating the clathrin and AP2 from the surface to vesicles inside of the cells . 108 In agreement with our findings ( Table 4 . 1 ) chlorpromazine was found to be very toxic at concentrations that are routinely used to inhibit CME , and this toxicity is cell - dependent . 105 It can also incorporate itself into the plasma membrane and severely affect fluidity of the membrane . 109 This in turn can alter pathways that involve the uptake of large particles like MPE . Chlorpromazine can also interfere with the dynamics of actin by altering the function of phospholipase C . 104 Other examples of commonly used drugs that are used in the study presented here include amantadine , genistein and amiloride . The function of amiloride was discussed above . Genistein is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that causes local disruption of the actin network and can inhibit the recruitment of dynamin to plasma membranes . 53 , 105 But dynamin is also essential for the scission and budding of clathrin vesicles . Amantadine was found to stabilize clathrin - coated vesicles and block their budding of plasma membrane . 103 , 110 But the action of amantadine has mostly been evaluated on the basis of endocytosis of viruses , so there is no certainty that it does not have non - specific action in non - viral vectors . There is also a concern that the chemical inhibitors might not only affect the endocytosis events but other cellular functions . 105 Chemical inhibitors also demonstrate various degree of specificity amongst different cell lines and conditions . Therefore , special considerations of selection of these inhibitors and their concentrations should be taken . Since most of the methods to study endocytosis have their advantages and weaknesses , it is imperative to combine such methods in studies instead of heavily relying on a single one . In the study presented here , we used a set of concentrations of chemical inhibitors instead of relying on a single concentration . We also implemented control groups that helped to reduce non - specific action of the employed drugs and non - specificities that are associated with the toxicity of siRNA and the vectors themselves . In conclusion , RNAi has a high therapeutic potential . The main obstacle to such therapy is an inability to safely deliver siRNA through the delivery barriers . One of the main barriers posed to delivered siRNA molecules is uptake into and subsequent processing inside of the cells . This highly complicated process can be subdivided into many separate pathways that have some overlaps but present different chemical environments to the delivered molecules . In order to rationally design a vector that will deliver siRNA , it is paramount to have more information on 19 the predominant uptake pathways that can lead to effective RNAi . Through the use of multiple chemical and biological methods we conducted an investigation into the mechanisms of the uptake and RNAi of two different model vectors in one model cancer cell line . 20 CHAPTER 3 : MATERIALS AND METHODS 3 . 1 Cells HeLaLuc ( luciferase - producing cervical cancer ) cells were a kind gift from Mark Davis group at CalTech . The culture media consisted of DMEM with 10 % ( v / v ) FBS ( Gemini Bio - Products , West Sacramento , CA ) , and the cells were incubated at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 . The cells were cultured according to ATCC protocol except of no antibiotics or fungicides were used . 3 . 2 Cytotoxicity The cytotoxicity of the chemical inhibitors was used as one of the factors in determining the concentration range of drugs that was used in this study . The cytotoxicity was measured using CellTiter - Blue cell viability assay ( Promega , Madison , WI ) according to manufacturer’s instructions . Briefly , cells were seeded at a density of 1X10 4 in 96 - well plates . Twenty four hours later , the media was aspirated and 100µl of serum - free media was added . In addition , drugs at various concentrations were added to the cells ( n = 4 ) and allowed to incubate for 4 hours . The drug - containing media was then replaced with culture media , and the cells were placed in the incubator for 20 hours . The CellTiter - Blue reagent was then added to wells at the amount of 20µl / well , and the cells were incubated for 4hours . The 96 - well plates were then placed in SpectraMAX 340 microplate reader ( Molecular Devices , Sannyvale , CA ) to measure the light absorbance at 570 and 600nm . The absorbance values at 600nm were subtracted from the values at 570nm , and the viability values were normalized to no - drug controls . 3 . 3 siRNA siRNA was used to study the efficiency of transfection , uptake of particles and in production of modified cells . The sequences of siRNA are presented in Table 3 . 1 . The anti - luciferase siRNA duplex ( siGL3 ) and human Lamin A / C siRNA duplex ( siLam ) were purchased from Dharmacon ( Lafayette , CO ) . Fluorescently tagged ( 3’ - AlexaFlour647 ) siGL3 and the siRNAs that target Clathrin , Caveolin - 1 , Flotillin - 1 and ARF6 proteins were purchased from Qiagen ( Germantown , MD ) . 21 Table 3 . 1 Description of the siRNA used in the study siRNA Abbreviation Target Protein Sense Sequence siGL3 Luciferase 5’ - CUUACGCUGAGUACUUCGATT - 3’ siLam Lamin 5’ - CTGGACTTCCAGAAGAACATT - 3’ siCLT Clathrin , heavy chain 5’ - AUCCAAUUCGAAGACCAAUTT - 3’ siCav Caveolin - 1 5’ - GCAAGUGUACGACGCGCACTT - 3’ siFLT Flotillin - 1 5’ - CAGAUCCAGAGGAUCUCUCTT - 3’ siARF ARF6 5’ - ACGUGGAGACGGUGACUUATT - 3’ 3 . 4 Lipids A combination of three lipids was used in order to create lipid - based delivery vector . DOTAP , DOPE and cholesterol were purchased from Avanti ( Alabaster , AL ) . The optimal composition of lipids for siRNA delivery was experimentally determined by performing transfections at a set of DOTAP : DOPE : cholesterol ratios of 1 : 0 : 0 , 1 : 1 : 0 , 1 : 0 : 1 , 2 : 11 : 7 , 5 : 8 : 7 , 11 : 2 : 7 , 1 : 2 : 7 , 3 : 3 : 14 and 2 : 1 : 7 ( w : w ) at 1 : 1 and 10 : 1 ( w : w ) of vector : siRNA ratios . The lipids were first separately dissolved in chloroform at concentration of 10mg / ml and mixed in glass tubes . The mixtures were let dry under vacuum overnight . On the next day , the lipid layer that formed on the bottom of the glass tubes was suspended in PIPES buffer ( 20mM PIPES , 150mM NaCl in water ) at concentration of 0 . 2mg / ml using water - bath sonicator . The lipid solutions were extruded through a 100nm polycarbonate membrane 11 times using Mini - Extruder ( Avanti ) prior to being combined with siRNA . The stock of lipid - solution was kept at 4°C . 3 . 5 Polymer PEI was used as a model for cationic polymer for siRNA delivery . Branched 25kDa PEI was purchased from Sigma and suspended in ddwater at concentration of 1mg / ml . The stock was kept at room temperature prior to being used as a delivery vector . 22 3 . 6 Formation of Polyplexes and Lipoplexes To prepare polyplexes and lipoplexes , an appropriate amount of the 20µM stock siRNA in RNase - free water solution was first added to PIPES buffer . The solution of lipids or PEI was then added to the siRNA solution to give the final weight ratio of 10 : 1 ( vector : siRNA ) . The particles were allowed to form via electrostatic interactions at room temperature for 30 minutes prior to being used for transfections . 3 . 7 siRNA transfection HeLaLuc cells were used as a model cell line in evaluation of the uptake of siRNA particles and their RNAi efficiency . The cells were seeded in 12 - well plates at density of 1X10 5 cells / well 24 hours prior to transfections . The culture media was replaced by a 1ml of serum - free media , and 50 µl of the siRNA - particles solution was added to each well to achieve final concentration of 5 nM of siRNA . The transfection media was replaced by a culture media 4 hours later . Twenty hours after the transfection , the cells were washed once with PBS and 100 µl of cell culture lysis reagent ( CCLR ) were added to each well . Twenty microliters of each sample were used to evaluate luciferase expression using Promega luciferase assay ( Promega , Madison , WI ) and Lumat LB 9507 luminometer ( Berthold , Oak Ridge , TN ) using manufacturer’s instructions . The total protein content was evaluated for each sample using Pierce BCA assay ( Peirce , Rockford , IL ) and used to normalize the relative light units ( RLU ) that represented the luciferase content of each sample . 3 . 8 Flow cytometry experiments to measure total uptake of particles Flow cytometry was used to evaluate the uptake of the siRNA - particles . As before , the cells were seeded 24 hours before the transfection on 12 - well plates at density of 1X10 5 cells / well . The particles were formed as described in Methods 3 . 6 , but fluorescently labeled ( AF - 647 ) siGL3was used . The cells were transfected in serum - free media for 2 hours . The cells were then washed once with 1ml of 0 . 001 % SDS in PBS and once with 1mL of PBS solutions to remove fluorescently labeled particles on the surface of the cells . Following the washing , 200µl of 0 . 25 % trypsin in PBS solution were added to each well , and the plates were allowed to incubate for 5 minutes . The cellular suspensions were mixed by pipetting and added to 300µl of FBS . The cells were stored on ice prior to be analyzed . FACS analyses were done on BD 23 FACSCanto flow cytometer ( BD Biosciences , San Jose , CA ) , and the data was analyzed using FCS Express v . 3 . 0 software ( De No Software , Los Angeles , CA ) . The gate was set based on the forward and side scattering parameters of living cells , and at least 2000 cells were collected in each group . 3 . 9 Transfections in the presence of chemical inhibitors The chemical inhibitors were used to block one of the endocytosis pathways . The stock solutions of chlorpromazine , amiloride , amantadine and mβCD ( Roquette , Gurnee , IL ) were prepared in water at concentrations of 5 , 5 , 50 and 250mg / ml , respectively . The stock of genistein was prepared in 50mg / ml in DMSO . Prior to transfections , the stock solutions were mixed with water such that adding 10µl of the new drug solution to 1ml of DMEM in the wells would achieve the desired final concentration of drugs . All of the drugs were added to cells at least 30 minutes before the siRNA solutions . 3 . 10 Production of RNAi - modified Cells We evaluated the uptake and the RNAi effects of siRNA - particles in cells that had a transient selective knockdown of traffic proteins . In order to produce the modified cells ( siMod cells ) , we seeded 2X10 5 HeLaLuc cells in 6 - well plates . Twenty four hours after the seeding , the cells were transfected in a serum - free media using RNAiMAX Lipofectamine reagent ( Life Technologies , Carlsbad , CA ) with final concentration of siRNA of 20nM listed in Table 3 . 1 using the manufacturer’s protocol . Briefly , for each experimental group , we first added appropriate amount of siRNA to 150µl of OptiMEM ( Invitrogen ) and separately added 3 . 5µl of RNAiMAX to a separate container with 150 µl of OptiMEM . The solutions were incubated for 10minutes , and the RNAiMAX solution was added drop wise to the siRNA solutions . The formed complexes were left at room temperature for 15 minutes and added to 2ml of DMEM that was placed instead of the culture media into the wells prior to transfections . Following 4 hours , the media was replaced with the serum - containing media and the cells were placed in the incubator for 24 hours . One of the control groups served a well into wich no siRNA was added and the other control had 20 nM siLam that does not interfere with cellular trafficking . A similar transfection was repeated , but at its conclusion , the cells were washed with PBS , trypsinized with 320µl of trypsin ( Cellgro , Manassas , VA ) and equally partitioned into 6 wells of 12 - well plate . 24 The plates were placed in incubator and cultured for 20 hours . Subsequently , the cells were either used in farther transfections or validated for a successful knockdown of traffic proteins using Western Blotting . The Western Blotting of modified cells was done using Westernbreeze Chromogenic Kit ( Invitrogen ) following the manufacture’s protocol . First the samples were lysed using 300 µl of the RIPA Lysis Buffer System ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) and the total protein concentration was verified to be the same across all the samples using BCA assay . Then 10 µl of the sample were added to the NuPAGE ( Invitrogen ) buffer and reduced by adding NuPAGE Reducing Agent ( Invitrogen ) and heating the samples at 70°C for 10 minutes . The samples were then resolved using electrophoresis on 10 % Novex Bis - Tris gels ( Invitrogent ) along with a ColorPlus pre - stained protein ladder ( BioLabs , Ipswich , MA ) . The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes , blocked with proprietary protein solutions ( Invitrogen ) for half an hour , incubated for 1 . 5 hours with primary antibodies ( Table 3 . 2 ) , incubated with secondary antibodies for an hour and developed using chromogenic substrate . The membranes were then wrapped with plastic wrap and scanned using a desktop scanner .

HeLaLuc cells were seeded on microscope cover slides that were placed inside of 6 - well plates at density of 1X10 5 cells / well and allowed to incubate for 48 hours . The particles were formed as described in sections 3 . 6 and 3 . 7 , except the fluorescently labeled ( AF - 647 ) siGL3 was used . The cells were transfected with polyplexes and lipoplexes at final siRNA concentration of 5 nM in serum - free media for 2 hours . The particle - containing media was aspirated and the cells were rinsed three times with PBS prior to being fixed with 3 . 7 % formaldehyde in PBS for 10 minutes . When the polyplexes were delivered , the cells were permeabilized with 0 . 25 % Triton X - 100 in PBS solution for 10 minutes . This step was skipped when lipoplexes were delivered because it washed them off the slides . The well plates were protected from the light throughout the procedure , and the cells were incubated at room temperature in 10 % FBS in PBS solution to prevent non - specific staining . An hour of incubation of cells in the primary antibody solution ( Table 3 . 2 ) was carried , and the cells were again washed three times with PBS and incubated in 5µg / ml of secondary fluorescently labeled ( AF - 488 ) antibody ( Invitrogen ) . Finally , the cells were washed trice with PBS , the cover slides were removed from the wells and fixed with Prolong Gold ( Invitrogen ) reagent that contained DAPI for nuclear staining . The slides were left in a dark place overnight and were sealed in the following day by nail polish . In order to determine if the particles that entered the cells did so through macropinocytosys , fluorescently labeled ( AF - 568 ) 10kDa dextran ( Invitrogen ) was used as a market for the fluid phase uptake by the cells . As described above , the transfection of fluorescently labeled siGL3 was performed on cells cultured on the cover slides , but100 minutes after the transfection , the dextran was added to wells to yield final concentration of 1 . 5mg / ml . The dextran was allowed to incubate with cells for 20 minutes . The media was then aspirated and the wells were washed three times with PBS , fixed with 3 . 7 % solution of formaldehyde . The slides were extracted from the wells and fixed with Prolong Gold Antifade reagent that contained DAPI similarly to when protein immunostainning was performed . The microscopy was performed using LSM 700 microscope ( Zeiss , Oberkochen , Germany ) 26 3 . 12 Energy dependency on uptake and RNAi The investigation of the energy dependency on the endocytosis of siRNA particles was performed using two temperature regimes . The seeding , transfections , luciferase and uptake ( flow cytometry ) measurements were carried out the same way as described above . However , during the incubation post transfection procedure , one plate was placed in 4°C refrigerator while the other in 37°C incubator . The incubation for the uptake study was done for 2 hours , and the incubation for the luciferase activity study was performed for 4 hours . After the incubation , the cells were washed with PBS , the media was replaced with serum - containing media and the plates from both groups were returned back to the 37°C incubator . In order to avoid thermal shock , the cells that were incubated at 4°C were washed with cold ( 4°C ) PBS , and the fresh culture media that was added post transfection to the wells was also cold . 3 . 13 Particle sizing Dynamic light scattering was used to measure the sizes and the polydispersity of the particles . Particles were prepared in PIPES buffer as described in X . X , except of the final siRNA concentration was 3 times higher than in the solution that was prepared for transfection , since lower concentrations of the particles were not detectable . However , the siRNA / vector weight ratios were preserved . The solutions were placed in transparent cuvettes , allowed to incubate at room temperature for 15 minutes and measured 10 times each using Brookhaven Instruments Corporation 90 Plus Particle Size Analyzer ( Holtsville , NY ) . 3 . 14 Calculations If not otherwise stated , the experiments were performed in triplicates . Except for the uptake studies , siLam was used as a control group with exactly the same experimental conditions ( drug concentrations , amount of vector used , temperature , etc . ) as in siGL3 groups apart of different siRNAs . This accounted for the toxicity and side effects of the drugs and the materials that were used . Equation 1 was used to calculate knockdown of reporter protein . ( 1 ) 27 For the flow cytometry , the average fluorescence of delivered tagged siRNA ( AF - 647 ) of each group was normalized to the average fluorescence of the control ( not treated or not modified ) groups . The error bars on graphs represent standard deviations . One - Way ANOVA with Tukey means comparison test in conjunction with equivalent surrogate data technique 111 using OriginPro8 . 6 ( Northampton , MA ) program were used to calculate statistical significance . The significance level ( α ) was set to 0 . 05 . The star - signs above the presented data indicate statistically significance compared to the control group . 28 CHAPTER 4 : EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 4 . 1 Selection of lipid vector composition Three lipids were combined to create lipid - based siRNA vector . HeLa cells were transfected using lipids of various compositions in order to determine the optimal composition and the amount of the vector to be used . As Figure 4 . 1 indicates , vectors that contained large amounts of DOTAP ( > 50 % of total vector weight ) promoted higher knockdown than vectors with higher content of the helper lipids ( cholesterol and DOPE ) . The knockdown was in the range of 7 - 25 % and 30 - 60 % when 1 : 1 and 10 : 1 ( w : w ) of vector : siRNA was used , respectively . The vector composition of 11 : 2 : 7 at 10 : 1 was used for the remainder of this study . 29 Figure 4 . 1 : Lipid vectors with an array of compositions were tested . Two different amounts of vectors were used : A . 1 : 1 and B . 10 : 1 of vector : siRNA on the weight basis . A B 30 4 . 2 Toxicity of chemical inhibitors One of the most important criteria for choosing the endocytosis inhibitors is their overall toxicity on the investigated cells . CellTiter Blue assay was performed to determine the feasible range of concentrations of the drugs . All of the drugs that were used in the study showed significant toxicity at higher concentrations . Table 4 . 1 details the range of the concentrations of drugs along with the toxicities that were associated with this range and Figure 4 . 2 presents the complete results of the toxicity investigation . Table 4 . 1 : List of the drugs , the concentrations used in the study and their associated toxicities Name of the Drug Concentration Range Used in the Study Toxicity Effects on HeLaLuc Cells at the Highest Concentration Used ( expressed in cell viability ) Chlorpromazine 0 . 5 - 5 µg / ml 45 % Amantadine 80 - 200 µg / ml 91 % Genistein 20 - 70 µg / ml 66 % mβCD 3 - 10 mg / ml 92 % Amiloride 10 - 50 µg / ml 69 % 31 Figure 4 . 2 : The viability of the HeLa cells at a wide range of five drugs that were used in the study . 32 Figure 4 . 3 : The effects of the temperature during the transfection on the knockdown and uptake of particles . ( A ) The RNAi promoted by both vectors was reduced ; however , the effect was more significant for PEI . ( B ) At low temperature the uptake of polyplexes almost halted and did not change for polyplexes . 4 . 3 Dependency of uptake and effective RNAi on thermal conditions In order to investigate the dependency on energy of the total uptake of the poly - and lipoplexes and effective endocytosis , transfections were performed at two different temperatures . If the uptake and the effective endocytosis are significantly inhibited by low temperatures , then it can be deduced that energy - dependent cellular machinery is involved in the process . However , if at lower temperatures the uptake of particles continues to occur and leads to RNAi then energy - independent direct fusion between the particles and cellular membranes is likely to be a major component of the process . The results of the transfections with incubation at low and physiological temperatures indicate that RNAi mediated by both of the delivery vectors is energy dependent . Lower temperature reduced knockdowns that were mediated by both vectors ; however , the effect was more dramatic in the case of the PEI vectors ( Fig . 4 . 3 . A ) As for the uptake , lower temperature almost completely inhibited the uptake of the polyplexes , but the uptake of the lipoplexes was almost not affected ( Fig . 4 . 3 . B ) . Together these A B 33 results indicate that the endocytosis of the siRNA / PEI particles is highly dependent on biological activity of the HeLa cells while the internalization of the siRNA / lipid occurs through direct fusion with plasma membrane . 4 . 4 Inhibition of uptake using drugs Chemical inhibitors of endocytosis were used to investigate their influence on the uptake of the siRNA particles ( Fig . 4 . 4 ) . A range of concentrations was chosen based on their toxicity and literature values . Since multiple drugs reduced the uptake of the PEI particles , it is evident that the uptake of these was occurring through multiple pathways . Chlorpromazine and amantadine reduced the uptake of the siRNA / PEI particles at higher concentrations ( > 3 µg / ml and > 150 µg / ml , respectively ) indicating entrance through CME . The reduction of uptake by ~ 40 % when genistein and amiloride were used implicated a role of CvME and MP in the uptake of PEI particles . The uptake of the lipid particles was most remarkably reduced by mβCD ( 25 – 60 % reduction in the drug concentration range of 3 – 10 mg / ml ) . This means that the cholesterol in the plasma membrane is important in the uptake of the lipid particles . Amantadine and amiloride reduced the uptake of the lipid and polymer particles ( amantadine : up to 40 % for polyplexes and 25 % for lipoplexes ; amiloride : up to 40 % for polyplexes and none for lipoplexes ) , but these effects did not persist at higher concentrations , indicating that the effects might decrease due to toxicity of the drugs . The drugs might affect cells differently at higher concentrations . The reduction in uptake of lipoplexes ( ~ 20 % ) occurred only at the highest tested concentration of genistein ( 70 µg / ml ) , so it is not likely that CvME is implicated in uptake of lipoplexes , but rather a different uptake mechanism is governing this process . 4 . 5 Inhibition of RNAi using drugs Figure 4 . 5 represents the effect of the chemical inhibitors on RNAi . When PEI was used as a delivery reagent , the RNAi was significantly inhibited by genistein ( from 35 % to up to 8 % knockdown ) and amiloride ( from 35 % to up to 10 % knockdown ) , indicating that even though the siRNA / PEI particles enter the cells through multiple pathways , those that enter through CvME and MP lead to RNAi . Genistein and mβCD reduced the knockdown mediated by siRNA / lipid particles ( genistein : from 55 % to up to 25 % knockdown ; mβCD : from 55 % to less than 5 % knockdown ) . This shows that CvME lead to the knockdown , and that cholesterol was also 34 essential to the process . Amiloride did not inhibit the knockdown mediated by the lipid - delivered siRNA at higher concentrations . This could be either due to side effects of amiloride at higher concentrations or due to possibly more efficient pathways that increased their activity as MP was inhibited . Since not all the drugs showed a clear pattern of inhibition of uptake and RNAi ( gradual decrease of uptake and RNAi as their concentration increased ) , this study demonstrates the importance of using an array of concentrations versus simply choosing a single value . Also , it is important to note that not every inhibition of uptake led to reduction in knockdown . 35 Figure 4 . 4 : Normalized uptake in presence of chemical inhibitors at an array of concentrations . When PEI was used , all of the drugs except of mβCD reduced the uptake . When lipid was used , mβCD , genistein ( at higher concentration ) and amantadine influenced the uptake . 36 Figure 4 . 5 : Effects of chemical inhibitors on RNAi . Neither chlorpromazine nor amantadine influenced the RNAi in either of the particles . Genistein reduced the knockdown in both types of particles , and mβCD dramatically reduced the knockdown in lipid - particles only . Amiloride at higher concentration reduced the RNAi mediated by PEI . 37 4 . 6 Uptake and RNAi efficiency of particle in RNAi - modified cells HeLaLuc cells were modified to reduce their content of proteins that are implicated to be essential to specific endocytosis pathways using siRNA with a commercially available transfection reagent . The knockdowns of the traffic proteins were confirmed using Western blotting ( Fig . 4 . 6 ) . The uptake of the particles and the knockdown of the reporter protein in modified cells are presented in Figures 4 . 7 and 4 . 8 , respectively . The reduction in caveolin , flotillin and ARF6 proteins significantly reduced the uptake of the siRNA / PEI particles ( by 60 , 50 and 60 % , respectively ) . This implies the importance of the associated pathways in uptake . As for the knockdown , the PEI mediated siRNA delivery was only statistically significantly reduced ( to almost 0 from 32 % ) in cells with reduced ARF6 . With the reduction of caveolin and flotillin the knockdown was also reduced ( from 32 to 22 and 21 % , respectively ) , but the effects were not strongly pronounced . The knockdown of caveolin increased the uptake of the siRNA / lipid particles by over 20 % . This means that either the structure of the plasma membranes was changed in a way that allowed for higher uptake or perhaps pathways other than CvME increased their activity and facilitated higher total uptake .

The reduction in caveolin , flotillin and ARF6 reduced the siRNA / PEI particle uptake . The uptake of the lipid particles was enhanced when caveolin was knocked out . Figure 4 . 8 : The reduction of the traffic proteins did not influence the knockdown that was mediated by the lipid particles . However , the reduction in ARF6 reduced the knockdown provided by siRNA / PEI particles . Caveolin and flotillin also influenced the knockdown by the siRNA / PEI particles , but the effect was not statistically significant . 39 4 . 7 Confocal laser scanning microscopy The proteins that are directly implicated in the investigated endocytosis pathways were immunologically stained with fluorescent antibodies after the lipid and polymer based vectors delivered fluorescently labeled siRNA . The co - localization between the proteins and the siRNA provides for direct evidence of association of specific endocytosis pathways activities . When delivered with PEI , siRNA strongly co - localized with caveolin and flotillin ( Fig . 4 . 10 and 4 . 11 ) . This provides direct evidence of the importance of the associated pathways . No co - localization was observed between polymer - delivered siRNA and clathrin ( Fig . 4 . 9 ) or ARF6 ( Fig 4 . 12 ) , so these proteins did not directly participate in the uptake . No studied proteins showed strong co - localization signs with lipid - delivered siRNA . However , this could be due to experimental difficulty to visualize lipid - delivered siRNA , since significant amounts of it washed of the slides during the permeation and washing steps . Only a minor evidence of association between caveolin , flotillin and siRNA delivered by lipid was observed . Fluorescent dextran was co - delivered with siRNA particles to study if the latter enter the cells through MPE . Indeed , co - localization between dextran and polymer - delivered siRNA was observed ( Fig . 4 . 13 ) . But since no such co - localization was observed with lipid - delivered siRNA , it can be concluded that lipid / siRNA particles do not simply enter the HeLa cells with the surrounding fluid . 40 Figure 4 . 9 Result of the co - localization study between the PEI - delivered siRNA ( represented in red ) and fluorescently tagged clathrin ( represented in green ) .

Particles were formed in PIPES buffer as described in Sec . 3 . 6 , and the results of the size measurements are presented in Table 4 . 2 . After the extrusion , the sizes of the lipid particles were significantly reduced . However upon mixing with siRNA , the sizes dramatically increased . This means that either siRNA neutralized the negative charge of the lipid vesicles causing the vesicles to aggregate , or that each siRNA molecule electrostatically attached to multiple lipid particles and caused aggregations to form . The sizes of the siRNA / PEI particles were much smaller than siRNA / lipid particles but comparable in size to the lipid vesicles after the extrusion .

Both the chemical and the biological techniques of selective inhibition of pathways of endocytosis were used to determine the uptake pathways that play the biggest role in siRNA delivery by PEI and lipids mixture . The investigation into the ability of polyplexes and lipoplexes that enter cells to mediate RNAi was also performed . 5 . 1 Effects of temperature The change in ambient temperature during the transfections is a widely used method to study the dependency of the uptake and activity of particles on energy - dependent biological activity of cells . 100 , 112 Decreasing the temperature during the transfections inhibits active transport processes ( endocytosis ) that cells might use . As expected , lowering the temperature to 4°C greatly decreased the uptake of the polyplexes into the cells . As a consequence , the RNAi mediated by the polyplexes was also sharply decreased . This is consistent with a common agreement that the uptake of these complexes occurs through endocytosis . 15 , 113 On the contrary , the uptake of the lipoplexes was not affected by the low temperatures while RNAi mediated by lipoplexes was lower at lower transfection temperatures . It is likely that the reduction of knockdown mediated by the lipid vector was due to a reduction in the intracellular activity of the cells as a result of the low temperature and not due to a decreased amount of siRNA that entered the cells . It is possible that at lower temperature the siRNA / lipid particles entered the cells through a mechanism that was different from the mechanism that leads to a successful RNAi , and this resulted in the reduced knockdown despite delivery of approximately equal amounts of siRNA at both 4°C and 37°C . Our findings demonstrate that lipoplexes entered the cells through a fusion with the plasma membrane rather than through active endocytosis . The reduction in activity induced by lipoplexes at lower temperatures was in agreement with observations by other labs 100 , 101 , but our finding of the total uptake of the lipoplexes are significantly different . The discrepancy could be easily explained . We employed a lipid - based vector with a composition that was optimized for siRNA delivery , while Lu et al . used DharmaFECT1 and Lipofectamine2K was used by Ming et 52 al . , so it is possible that our delivery reagent was internalized more efficiently by direct fusion rather than endocytosis . 100 , 101 5 . 2 Chemical inhibitors Although the most common investigation method , chemical inhibitors are the least specific in selective inhibition of pathways . However , since they are routinely exploited by most of the researchers that study endocytosis , they are suitable for comparison with other studies and good as an initial method in studying endocytosis . Chlorpromazine is usually used as a disruptor of CME that prevents the dissociation of clathrin coated pits from the plasma membrane . Chlorpromazine induced the highest toxicity in the investigated cell line ( Table 4 . 1 ) . The uptake and the subsequent RNAi of the lipoploplexes were not affected even by the highest concentrations of chlorpromazine . In the polyplex case , the uptake was gradually decreased with the increase in chlorpromazine concentration . Contrary to that , RNAi was induced with gradual increase of chlorpromazine concentration , albeit the increase was not statistically significant . This means that polyplexes entered the cells through CME , but this pathway did not lead to RNAi . The increase in the functional effect of the cargo at higher concentrations of chlorpromazine is consistent with previous findings . 103 , 114 This could be due to increased amounts of particles that are available to clathrin - independent pathways that are more effective in RNAi or due to side effects of chlorpromazine . Amantadine was also used as a disruptor of CME by stabilization of clathrin coated pits on plasma membrane . This drug was not consistent in blocking the uptake of lipoplexes at higher concentrations , but it consistently reduced the uptake of the polyplexes . Amantadine did not significantly alter RNAi induced by both types of the vectors , but the RNAi was slightly reduced in the case of polyplexes . The results again indicate that lipoplexes did not enter the cells through CME . It appears that the reduction in uptake of polyplexes by amantadine was not sufficient to reduce RNAi . Overall , the results from these drugs indicate that there was no association between CME and lipid particles , but a large fraction of polymer particles entered the cells through CME without being efficient in mediating the knockdown . Genistein was used as a CvME inhibitor by inhibiting tyrosine kinase , but can also interfere with dynamin recruitment to the plasma membrane which can lead to CME inhibition . 53 Both the uptake of and knockdown mediated by the polyplexes was greatly reduced in the presence of genistein . However , the effect on lipoplexes activity was not significantly altered by the same amounts of genistein . Only higher concentrations of genistein ( > 50 µg / ml ) reduced RNAi mediated by lipoplexes and their total uptake . If genistein interferes with the movement of caveolin molecules , then it might also effect the distribution of cholesterol on plasma membrane , since these two are known to interact . Altering the distribution and organization of cholesterol in the plasma membrane can lead to alterations of direct fusion process of lipoplexes , but this point will have to be confirmed . Based on the genistein inhibition , CvME might be involved in uptake and processing of both types of the particles . As described earlier , cholesterol can play a major role in multiple endocytosis pathways . In addition to that , the depletion of cholesterol from the plasma membrane might reduce the amount of cholesterol inside of the cells which will have effect on the fusion events that occur in intracellular space between various vesicles with lipid - based membranes . We studied the effects of cholesterol depletion using mβCD . As expected , this drug greatly reduced the uptake of cholesterol - rich lipoplexes and knockdown of reporter gene provided by lipoplexes . This might be a consequence of reduction of fusion events between the lipoplexes and plasma membranes . We observed a strong and consistent inverse correlation between the concentration of mβCD and uptake and activity of siRNA / lipid particles . Interestingly , mβCD was the only drug that affected the lipoplexes to a higher degree than polyplexes . The endosomes that are formed as a result of CME are rapidly acidified , so the release of the cargo is probably relying on the “proton sponge” effect rather than on natural “leakiness” of endosomes as they fuse with other intracellular compartments . If the majority of polyplexes enter cells through CME , then it is expected that the subsequent RNAi process would be less dependent on cholesterol than the internalization of lipoplexes through direct fusion . The results obtained by our lab are consistent with previously published data where mβCD had higher effect on uptake of lipoplexes rather than on polyplexes . 101 Macropinocytosis can play a major role in HeLa cells , since these are rapidly dividing cancer cells . Even though amiloride is considered to be a highly specific MPE inhibitor , the results indicate that it might have changed its mode of action at higher concentrations . The total uptake of lipoplexes was not affected by any concentrations of amiloride , but the uptake of 54 polyplexes was initially reduced and then increased as the concentration of amiloride increased . Since the decrease in the polyplex uptake was very significant , it is evident that MPE is important for uptake of polyplexes . Amiloride consistently decreased the RNAi by polyplexes , but the effect on lipoplexes was more complex : knockdown decreased first and then increased at the highest concentration of amiloride . It is possible that such behavior occurred as a result of a non - specific effect , especially since the toxicity of amiloride was fairly high in the investigated cell line . Just like with other chemical inhibitors , the effects might greatly vary between cell lines and concentrations . For example , in 2010 Alam et al . used 5µM amiloride ( ~ 1 . 2 µg / mL ) to inhibit MPE in human melanoma cells 115 , however in 2011 the same group published an article where the concentration of 100 µM amiloride was used to inhibit MPE in HeLa S3 cells . 101 This is a common occurrence and one of the reasons why we chose to investigate a wide range of concentrations of each inhibitor . Nevertheless , the data indicates that polyplexes are more affected by MPE inhibition than lipoplexes , and MPE leads to efficient knockdown in the case of polymer - based delivery . 5 . 3 Biological inhibitors RNAi was used to selectively knockdown proteins that are essential for the endocytosis pathways . Even though this technique does not guarantee a complete shutdown of specific pathways , it significantly decreases their activity in more selective manner than chemical inhibitors 105 . The success of knockdown was confirmed with Western blots ( Fig . 4 . 6 ) . The knockdown of clathrin inhibited CME . Surprisingly , such inhibition did not have major effect on uptake or RNAi of polyplexes or lipoplexes . Inhibition of CvME by siRNA significantly reduced the uptake of polyplexes . This reduction in the polyplexes uptake only marginally reduced RNAi . The situation was very similar when FME was inhibited . This means that even though a significant fraction of polymer - based particles entered the cells through CvME and FME , they were not the major contributor to RNAi . Recent publication that includes investigation of endocytosis pathways of polymer - delivered DNA vectors in epithelial cells used a similar technique to knock down flotillin and caveolin proteins . Their results showed that the knockdown of caveolin can also reduce the amount of flotillin . 64 We cannot confirm their result , since we used different controls in our Western blots . However , it cannot be ruled out that a similar situation could possibly occur in our experiments , even though we used different siRNA 55 sequences , different cell lines and slightly different procedures . Caveolin is homologous to flotillin , so they might have a similar effect on the organization of cholesterol in plasma membranes . The inhibition of CvME actually increased the uptake of lipoplexes , and this was not observed with FME inhibition . Since the depletion of cholesterol from plasma membrane by mβCD greatly reduced the uptake of lipid particles , it is suggested that caveolin changed the cholesterol distribution of the plasma membrane . Since caveolin is mostly located in secluded regions on plasma membrane ( caveolae ) and attracts cholesterol , we hypothesize that depletion of caveolin leads to more sparse distribution of cholesterol on plasma membrane which in turn leads to greater number of sites where the fusion between the cholesterol - rich lipoplexes and plasma membrane can occur . It is also probable that caveolin depletion led to easier recruitment of cholesterol by other pathways ( such as FME ) which mediated significant increase in the uptake . However , these claims will have to be experimentally verified . Since the knockdown of other traffic proteins did not significantly alter the uptake or the processing of the lipoplexes , we conclude , in agreement with other groups 100 , 101 , that oligonucleotide / lipid particles are likely to directly fuse with plasma membrane rather than undergo endocytic process . The knockdown of ARF6 significantly reduced the uptake of the polyplexes , but the effect on the RNAi was the most dramatic . Since ARF6 protein is involved in multiple pathways , it is impossible to conclude from these data which pathway was inhibited . There are indications that ARF6 is involved in fluid - phase uptake pathways 64 , MPE and FME might be involved in the uptake of the polyplexes . This result can be supported by the experiment with inhibition using amiloride . ARF6 inhibition certainly also directly reduced the activity of the ARF6 - dependent pathway . Since ARF6 is heavily involved with recycling pathways , we hypothesize that reduction in ARF6 expression decreased the number of events in which fusion and budding of endocytic membranes occurred . Since these events can cause “leakiness” and escape of the cargo to the cytosol , their reduction will lead to fewer polyplexes that escaped from endosomes . This might be the primary reason for such a drastic decrease in RNAi with a decrease in the uptake that was comparable to decrease in other groups . Since the uptake was measured 2 hours post transfection , it is also possible that the reduction in the recycling mechanism did not dramatically influence the uptake , but the RNAi that was evaluated 20 hours after the 4 hours transfection was affected as a result of some unknown biological responses . 56 5 . 4 Microscopy Confocal microscopy observation of co - localization between the traffic proteins and delivered siRNA is one of the most direct methods of studying endocytic routes . Strong co - localization might be a false - positive , since the stained proteins might be moving from the site of their production to the plasma membrane or be involved in various retrograde trafficking without being directly involved in the investigated endocytosis pathway . As described in the background chapter , proteins that are mainly involved in one pathway might be present in vesicles that are formed in other pathways and lead to false - positive result . However , if no co - localization is observed , then the conclusion about the importance of specific pathways in the uptake can be reached with higher confidence . It is worthy to note that co - localization cannot directly show the impact of pathways on RNAi , but if it is observed that many particles are taken up by a specific pathway , and this pathway does not lead to RNAi , then an appropriate recommendation can be made about the future utility of this pathway in the design of novel delivery vectors . Strong co - localization was observed between the siRNA delivered by the polyplexes and caveolin , flotillin and fluid phase marker dextran . ARF6 and clathrin did not co - localize with siRNA . This means that ARF6 was probably acting as a regulator of the polyplexes uptake rather than being directly involved in the process . The lack of co - localization with clathrin was surprising in light of the results of the total uptake that were obtained with CME inhibition by chlorpromazine and amantadine . However , all other experiments confirm that CME is not involved in endocytosis of polyplexes . The co - localization with other proteins confirms that polyplexes enter the HeLa cells through multiple pathways with CvME being the most effective in leading to RNAi . Punctate patterns of fluorescent siRNA could be enough to suggest that particles localize in endolysosomes 100 or at least in some intracellular vesicles . The lack of aggregations and accumulation of fluorescently labeled siRNA inside of cells suggest that no uptake of particles occurred , the particles could be washed off during the staining process or the distribution of the siRNA in the intracellular space is sparse . This is because single fluorescent molecules provide much weaker fluorescence signals than aggregates of such molecules , and these weak signals are 57 usually filtered out . In the experiments presented here , we could not obtain punctate patterns of siRNA molecules when they were delivered by lipid vector and stained in the same manner as the cells transfected with polyplexes . The method used for staining in this study mostly followed the procedure designed for polyplexes 102 , but poor immobilization on the slides of the polyplexes could still be happening as a result of unique composition of the employed lipid vectors . In order to get more meaningful results , the modification of the staining procedure was done to make it “more gentle” by eliminating the permeation step . This yielded higher retention of lipid - based particles on the slides . However , this also limited the access of the primary and secondary antibodies into the cells . Nevertheless , no co - localization between any of the fluorescent proteins and lipid - delivered siRNAs was observed . In addition , fewer punctate aggregations of siRNA were detected with lipid than with polymer based vectors , even though higher knockdown was observed with lipoplexes compared to polyplexes ( control groups in Fig . 4 . 3 ) . This implies that not only did lipids not deliver siRNA through one of the known mechanisms investigated here , but this new mechanism allowed for more efficient and perhaps more rapid release of siRNA from the particles than in the case of the polyplexes . 5 . 5 Size influence Size of the particles can have a profound effect on the endocytosis route that the particles undergo . Experiments with internalization of latex particles of various sizes into murine melanoma cells revealed that particles up to 200 nm in size enter the cells through CME , while particles in the range of 200 to 500 nm entered the cells through a pathway that is associated with caveolin protein and heavily dependent on cholesterol . However , even the entrance of small 50 nm latex particles was severely reduced by ~ 50 % as a result of cholesterol depletion . 116 The polyplexes that were investigated in our study were approximately 200 nm in diameter . The chemical properties of PEI particles bound to siRNA and lipoplexes are expected to differ from simple latex particles , and different cell line was used in our study . Still , our data indicate that even 200 nm polyplexes are not likely to enter the cells through CME . The lipoplexes used in this study were approximately 450 nm in diameter . This is much larger than the limit of the particles that can internalize through CME but not completely outside of the range of particles that enter through endocytosis . It is apparent that the rigid structure of clathrin - coated pits limit the size of the internalized particles more than coats of vesicles originated from other 58 pathways . 116 All together , this supports our hypothesis that the polyplexes in our experiments entered the cells through various routes other than CME . It was also reported that the internalization of larger particles depends on cholesterol much more than the internalization of smaller particles . 116 The results obtained in our experiments confirm this observation , even though we hypothesize that lipoplexes carrying siRNA mostly fuse with the plasma membranes unlike the latex particles that lack this function . Cholesterol in plasma membrane is necessary for localization of various proteins , actin reorganization and membrane ruffling . 52 It is difficult to determine which of these functions is the most important for the uptake and processing of particles , but it is highly likely that it is a combination of these functions . 59 CHAPTER 6 : CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS An extensive investigation of the predominant endocytosis pathways that are employed by HeLa cells to internalize and process siRNA - based polyplexes and lipoplexes was performed . Temperature variation during the transfection step was used to determine the energy dependency of the uptake of particles . The effects of chemical inhibitors and selective protein knockdown on uptake and RNAi of poly - and lipoplexes were investigated using flow cytometry and reporter gene knockdown . Confocal fluoresce imaging was carried out to investigate co - localization between the proteins that are directly participating in endocytosis pathways and delivered siRNA . Lowering the temperature during the transfection greatly reduced the uptake of polyplexes and did not affect the uptake of lipoplexes . RNAi mediated by polyplexes almost completely halted while lipoplexes still provided considerable knockdown . This means that polyplexes use energy - dependent endocytosis while lipoplexes mostly directly fused with membranes delivering siRNA . Chemical inhibitors , albeit not very specific , revealed that polyplexes enter the cells through CME , CvME and MPE , but CvME and MPE allow for more efficient RNAi than CME . The uptake of lipoplexes is highly dependent on cholesterol ; some of the lipoplexes might enter cells and mediate RNAi through CvME . A more specific technique of selective pathway shutdown demonstrated that CME is not involved in uptake and processing of polyplexes , and this was also confirmed by microscopy . The same techniques showed that uptake of polyplexes occurs through multiple pathways that include CvME , FME , MPE , and somewhat depends on ARF6 . All of these pathways are also functional in RNAi , and ARF6 is crucial for efficient processing of polyplexes . The effect of the knockdown of traffic proteins showed that only the reduction in caveolin - 1 in plasma membrane can affect the uptake of lipoplexes , but this does not lead to a significant change in the mediated RNAi . Oligonucleotides delivered by lipids did not co - localize with any of the stained proteins , and it appears that less accumulation in intracellular compartments of siRNA delivered by lipids occurred compared to polymer - delivered system . The results of this study suggest that for design of siRNA vectors more attention should be given to release of the polymeric particles from endosomes , but they should not be based on the acidification of CME - originated endosomes but rather on disruption of endosomal 60 membranes by other means . Perhaps the polymer that specifically evades CME can be designed by chemical modifications of conjugations with various ligands . Lipids are more promising vectors , since they allow for release of siRNA directly into the cytosol and evade limitations of intracellular trafficking . However , lipids without any additional modifications might deliver the cargo into the cells too rapidly in the case of systemic ( intravenous ) delivery . Efficient lipid vectors are likely to deliver their cargo close to the location of administration , and since they distribute their cargo inside of the cells in an efficient manner ( with no accumulation in separate endolysosomal compartments ) , the chance that they will exocytose the particles back and allow for their continued circulation is much slimmer than in the case of polymer delivery systems . The mechanism of endocytosis has not been completely interpreted . Not only are the steps of some of the pathways unknown , but it is likely that there are some pathways that have not been discovered yet . The design of the vectors for gene delivery will heavily depend on the biology of endocytosis . As a result , the future studies should concentrate on the kinetics of the process rather than solely on the biology . It is highly important to determine the limiting steps of the gene delivery . Perhaps , this will also have to be done through multiple techniques such as co - localization with Förster resonance energy transfer and more specific flow cytometry assays . The data from such experiments will have to be quantified from the studies of multiple vectors , and clear conclusions will be done to connect the structure and the materials of these vectors with their delivery efficiency and limiting steps . 61 REFERENCES 1 .
