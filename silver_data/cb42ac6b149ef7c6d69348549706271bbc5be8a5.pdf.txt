This study investigated the differences between VC , VR and F2F training conditions by evaluating the level of body ownership and agency perceived by trainees . An electrical circuit repair task and multiple surveys were used to gather data from 106 participants in the form of four dependent variables : a circuit knowledge test , task completion rate , number of the subtasks completed by failing participants , and test phase duration . The study included two visits by each participant to measure knowledge retention while there were no training and surveys in Visit 2 . Results showed significantly higher circuit learning and knowledge retention scores in F2F and VR conditions than in VC . Also , regarding the retention of knowledge , participants had significantly better knowledge retention in Visit 1 than Visit 2 . The authors hope the results of this study enable training developers to enhance the learning process in computer mediated communications .

I NTRODUCTION Distance learning systems are increasingly important in educational and professional training practice . The COVID - 19 pandemic and compulsory social distancing increased the importance of distance communication and motivated industries to explore alternatives to Face - to - Face ( F2F ) communication . Various computer - mediated communication ( CMC ) technologies have been proposed to facilitate remote education and training . Video conferencing [ 1 ] and virtual environments [ 2 ] are potentially the most applicable remote training technologies . These technologies have the potential to replace F2F interaction , enabling effective remote education and enhancing overall productivity by reducing physical infrastructure constraints . Choosing appropriate computer - mediated technologies for specific learning objectives requires comprehensive knowledge of the differences between these technologies and their effects on training . Among the multiple metrics that cause differences in communication technologies , embodiment is defined as a “part of self - consciousness and arises through multisensory information processing” [ 25 , p . 2 ] . It is an interdisciplinary concept with neuropsychological aspects , and the effects of embodiment differences are pronounced in the interaction between users and systems . These differences are distinct when compared in a real environment using varied communication technologies . In a meta - analysis of physical embodiment [ 4 ] , this distinction was demonstrated by showing that physical robots in real environment compared to the agents in virtual environment , have stronger positive interaction effects on the users . In the case of educational technologies , these differences are critical to regard since they could affect the learning efficiency [ 3 , 5 ] . So , the examination of embodiment could help the educational field make necessary performance improvements of the trainer and enhance the learning process . Embodiment is defined as the sense that emerges when that body’s properties are processed as if they were the properties of one’s own biological body , using three sub - factors of self - location , agency , and body ownership [ 7 ] . Self - location is the localization of oneself within the spatial limits of a body [ 8 ] . Agency is the intention and execution of actions that includes the feeling of controlling of one’s own body movements and , through those actions , the events in the external environment [ 9 ] . Body ownership is the sense that one’s own body is the source of any sensations felt [ 9 ] . While some papers argue that inducing a sense of embodiment will lead to promotion of learning [ 5 ] , the effect of embodiment’s components on training effectiveness is still not fully known . Advanced comparison of training effectiveness under various embodiment situations may help improve educational frameworks by figuring out the differences performance variables in different training environments . The goal of this paper was to examine the role of body ownership and agency on four mentioned training effectiveness variables . This study used a circuit simulator virtual environment for a training task and compared three training environment conditions : Face to Face ( F2F ) , Virtual Reality ( VR ) , and Video Conferencing ( VC ) . Each condition was assumed to have different levels of body ownership and agency . After describing the study and its results , the authors discuss how the different levels of body This work was funded in part by the Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy ( ARPA - E ) , U . S .

II . R ELATED W ORK This research discusses the comparison of body ownership and agency , two embodiment components , in VC , VR , and F2F training conditions , and then determine which situation provides the best training experience . In the following paragraphs , the topic of embodiment and papers which compared different situations for training effectiveness are summarized . A . Embodiment in Learning Technology The impact of embodiment on learning has been studied from many perspectives . Some papers focused on the general idea of embodiment , e . g . , presenting six percepts related to embodied learning technology [ 11 ] or explaining embodied interaction framework to help the designers in developing the learning technology [ 12 ] . In addition , other research has analyzed embodiment’s effect on particular learning environment structures ( e . g . , VR ) . Regarding extended reality ( XR ) , the relationship between gestural interaction and subsequent learning was analyzed [ 13 ] . Also , the impact of changes in bottom - up and top - down aspects of the design that can affect collective usability in a learning environment was explored by Lyons and Mallavarapu [ 14 ] . VR is another form of learning technology that has been used to analyze the effects of embodiment . Assessing the usability between the multiple users and single users [ 15 ] , and evaluating whether embodiment and engagement have any relationship in the VR environment [ 16 ] are some examples that were studied previously . Analysis of the user experience for finding a correlation between user experience and embodiment [ 17 ] is another study which was done in in a 3D environment . However , few studies have analyzed the effects of embodiment on learnability by experimenting with different training scenarios . B . Related Experimental Studies Several studies have focused on understanding the differences between multiple learning environments by measuring different communication objectives in order to improve the training effectiveness . Comparing F2F ( i . e . , as the most traditional way of training ) with advanced learning technologies is the most frequent educational environment comparison . Multiple researchers compared F2F with VR in order to understand which environment is more effective for training . These studies score the effectiveness by measuring either the performance of the participants using surveys , questionnaires , and tests [ 18 ] – [ 21 ] , some related criteria that can affect training ( e . g . , fatigue , stress , sense of presence [ 22 ] ) , or situational apprehension and performance [ 23 ] . F2F has also been compared to VC with learning measures such as final performance testing [ 24 ] ; reaction , knowledge outcome , change in practice [ 25 ] ; and confidence , oral competence [ 26 ] . Comparing VR and VC is the most recent subject that was studied like measuring experience , feeling , learning , value , and transfer and understand the learning differences between VR and VC [ 27 ] . This study contributed to this discipline by comparing the effects of embodiment on training effectiveness in different learning environments . C . Research Gap and Contribution When investigating the effects on training in VR and other CMCs , many studies focused on independent variables other than embodiment . Based on information from the literature , less attention has been paid to the effect of variation in level of embodiment on training effectiveness . The current study focused on two components of embodiment ( body ownership and agency ) and compares evaluation of training effectiveness in VR , VC , and F2F conditions ( different levels of embodiment ) to fill this gap . III . E XPERIMENTAL D ESIGN , H YPOTHESIS , AND M ETHODOLOGY To evaluate the effects of variations of embodiment on training effectiveness , this study varied the embodiment level by using three training conditions : standard VC software ( i . e . , Zoom ) , immersive VR , and F2F or in - person communication . This study’s objective was to determine the effects of body ownership of the participant’s body and agency on objective training performance . A . Experimental Environment Initially , this experiment had been designed to collect data in a laboratory environment with physical circuit boards but was modified to accommodate social distancing and facilities closures related to COVID - 19 . A digital electronics laboratory called Circuit World ( CW ) [ 28 ] , was designed to be a digital replica of a physical electronics laboratory . In addition to the electronic components , CW also contained storage areas where components were stored . To complete the test phase , participants needed to remember the spatial locations of the components as well as the procedure for the circuit repair . CW was created with the Unity Engine and incorporated a circuit simulator [ 29 ] to enable functional circuit parts . The components functioned similarly to real physical components , making troubleshooting faulty circuits a more realistic exercise . It was necessary to avoid an overly simplified or overly difficult task to avoid floor or ceiling effects in our data collection . It may seem that the study compared dissimilar body presentations when it compared a physically present person with a Zoom video stream and an avatar in a virtual environment , since these body representations have vastly different fidelity levels . However , the study focused on the elements of the fidelity that were required for this Circuit World repair task [ 30 ] i . e . , head gaze direction , hand position , and which circuit components were being held by the hands at each time point . All three conditions offered body representations that were approximately equal regarding these task requirements . B . Participants Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) approval was obtained from Iowa State University . Participant qualifications included being at least 18 years of age , living in the U . S . , understanding of English , and normal or corrected vision . Online participants working remotely with the researcher and the trainer were 45 Authorized licensed use limited to the terms of the applicable license agreement with IEEE . Restrictions apply . required to have access to broadband internet , a webcam , and a computer that ran Windows . A subset of participants also needed access to a tethered VR HMD ( head - mounted display attached to a PC ) that was compatible with SteamVR and our developed research application . They also had to have a low propensity for cybersickness ( nausea , headaches , or dizziness associated with virtual environments ) . Participants were recruited through a participant sourcing firm , Prolific , as well as from social media . The between - subjects design assigned each participant to one of the conditions . The final participant pool included 106 participants , though there are fewer in some analyses because of missing data . Fig . 1 shows the procedure and participants’ demographic information . Fig . 1 . Overview of procedure . Fig . 2 . Participant view of circuitworld in the video conferencing condition . Fig . 3 . Participant view in VR condition with the red avatar representing the trainer . C . Hypothesis The authors hypothesized that the VC condition would have lower agency than the VR or F2F conditions ( H1 ) . Although the authors expected to see the lower body ownership in VR condition than the other conditions , the language in the Virtual Embodiment Questionnaire ( VEQ ) [ 3 ] – a method that was used to measure the body ownership – refers to a sense of virtual avatars and the authors anticipated to see the highest body ownership for the VR condition ( H2 ) . To investigate these hypotheses , the VEQ was included . D . Experimental Set - up Two investigators were responsible for running the experiment with each participant : the researcher and the trainer . The researcher’s responsibility was helping the participant with the experimental procedure . Each participant saw a four - minute tutorial video that discussed the basics of the circuit task and the environment . Then the trainer joined the session ( either in person , in Zoom , or in CW using a head - mounted display ) only for the training and explained and demonstrated the circuit board repair task ( see Fig . 2 and Fig . 3 ) . F2F : In F2F , the trainer sat physically next to the participant in front of a single computer and demonstrated a desktop version of CW for the participant . VC : The trainer and participant communicated via Zoom through the trainer’s shared screen as they demonstrated CW with their face video showing in one corner ( see Fig . 2 ) . VR : Participants used a head - mounted display ( HMD ) and hand controllers to enter into CW with the trainer . The participant and the trainer communicated in a virtual environment using an open audio channel and the participant could see a simplistic avatar representing the trainer ( see Fig . 3 ) . In this condition , the trainer explained to the participants how to work with the HMDs and the joysticks in addition to the previous explanations . The VR condition provided a greater level of agency for participants compared to video conferencing condition because it offers the ability for participants to control their perspective and move about the environment . Because many participants participated online using their own tethered VR HMD , the particular HMD hardware could not be controlled . To summarize , across the three conditions , the trainer and the participant communicate differently , but each communicates about the same context of learning ( Circuit World ) . A key difference was that pparticipants in the VR condition could directly interact in a 3D environment while the others had only a flat screen to observe . For all participants , the training lasted nine minutes on average . The training introduced participants to several possible issues that could be the cause of a faulty circuit and how to repair each issue . The trainer invited participant questions and provided responses only during the training phase . Participants could not manipulate objects in CW during training . The trainer followed a consistent script to ensure consistency across participants . After training , the trainer left the meeting , and the test phase began . Participants in all conditions were told they needed to use their training to repair a circuit within a flat screen desktop version of CW . A video shared by the researcher explained the detailed functionality and controls of CW , e . g . , how the mouse and specific buttons worked . After playing the video , a CW practice area was loaded , and the participants had five minutes to move around , interact with the objects , and practice plugging in wires . Once the five minutes were over , or the participant felt comfortable enough , the test started . 46 Authorized licensed use limited to the terms of the applicable license agreement with IEEE . Restrictions apply . First , the participant answered a 12 - item multiple - choice knowledge assessment on content specific to the circuit board training . Participants then performed a circuit board repair task in desktop CW . The repair process was separated into nine subtasks based on whether they selected the correct components and connected them appropriately . When the participants finished the test , the Visit 1 appointment was over . In the second test phase ( Visit 2 ) , the participant repeated the same knowledge assessment and circuit repair task within Desktop CW after approximately two weeks later . The goal of the second test phase was to evaluate knowledge retention without any training ; there was no trainer in this phase , and the participant had interaction with only the researcher . E . Measures Dependent variables included scores on the knowledge test , completion rate on the repair task ( success or fail ) , the number of correct repair steps completed whether or not the final circuit functioned , the time required to complete the repair , and participants’ ratings of body ownership and agency during the training experience . IV . R ESULTS Two constructs , body ownership and agency , were evaluated for the three training environments . It was hypothesized that the VC condition would have lower agency than the VR condition or F2F condition ( H1 ) , and the VR condition would have lower body ownership than the VC condition ( H2 ) . To confirm those hypotheses , the Virtual Embodiment Questionnaire was included [ 3 ] . Two separate analyses of variance ( ANOVAs ) were conducted to test the difference in body ownership and agency between the three training environments . There were significant differences in the overall analyses for both body ownership ( F ( 2 , 101 ) = 5 . 39 , p = 0 . 006 , η p2 = 0 . 27 ) and agency ( F ( 2 , 101 ) = 9 . 25 , p < 0 . 001 , η p2 = 0 . 39 ) . When contrasts between the environments were examined , similar patterns emerged . Those in the VR condition rated both constructs significantly higher compared to those in both the VC ( body ownership d = 0 . 49 , p = 0 . 04 ; agency d = 1 . 00 , p < 0 . 001 ) and F2F conditions ( body ownership d = 0 . 85 , p = 0 . 002 ; agency d = 0 . 97 , p < 0 . 001 ) . There were no significant differences between those in the VC and F2F conditions ( Fig . 4 ) . Training effectiveness for each condition was analyzed by two methods : ( A ) Knowledge quiz and ( B ) successful repair of the circuit . After participants were shown a demonstration of how CW worked in general , but before they were able to interact with it themselves , they completed a 12 - item knowledge quiz online . Participants took the same knowledge quiz at the beginning of Visit 2 . Fig . 5 shows the average number of knowledge quiz questions participants answered correctly during each visit for each condition . Overall , participants scored significantly lower during Visit 2 ( M = 8 . 61 , SD = 2 . 21 ) compared to Visit 1 ( M = 10 . 19 , SD = 1 . 57 ) ; t ( 100 ) = 8 . 26 , p < 0 . 001 . However , there was no significant effect of training environment across time ; F ( 2 , 88 ) = 2 . 56 , p = 0 . 08 ( See Fig . 5 ) . Fig . 4 . Ratings in VR were significantly higher than the other two conditions . Error bars = SD ; * p < . 05 , * * p < . 01 , * * * p < . 001 . Fig . 5 . Number of correct answers for knowledge test . VR and F2F overlap . scores were significantly lower in Visit 2 than in Visit 1 . There was no effect of training condition . The second metric used to measure the training effectiveness at each level of body ownership and agency was the participants’ performance in fixing the circuit . Fig . 6 and Fig . 7 show the percentage of participants who were successful or failed at repairing the circuit . The lower , green part of the chart shows the successful participants ( i . e . , they fixed the circuit ) while the upper , gold part shows the failed participants ( who could not make the circuit operational : one or more subtasks failed ) . Overall , in Visit 1 , 64 % of the participants were successful in fixing the circuit , while this percentage decreased to 50 % for a Visit 2 , which was significantly different per a McNemar chi - squared test ( p = 0 . 008 ) . Regarding task completion rate , in Visit 1 , participants were significantly more successful at completing the circuit in both the VR ( X 2 ( 1 , n = 22 ) = 6 . 53 , p = 0 . 01 , φ = 0 . 55 ) and F2F ( X 2 ( 1 , n = 25 ) = 11 . 65 , p = 0 . 001 , φ = 0 . 68 ) conditions ; there was no significant difference in the VC condition , X 2 ( 1 , N = 20 ) = 0 . 21 , p = 0 . 65 , φ = 0 . 10 . Effect size for chi - squared results is phi ( φ ) , with 0 . 10 = small , 0 . 30 = moderate , 0 . 50 = large . In Visit 2 , there were no significant differences for any condition . 47 Authorized licensed use limited to the terms of the applicable license agreement with IEEE . Restrictions apply . Fig . 6 . Task completion rate : did they repair the circuit ? Difference was statistically different . Fig . 7 . Task completion rate by condition . differences in VR and F2F were statistically significant . In order to successfully complete the circuit task , participants were required to complete nine subtasks . Overall , of those who did not complete the task , they were able to complete an average of 3 . 97 ( SD = 2 . 54 ) subtasks during Visit 1 and 3 . 46 ( SD = 2 . 89 ) subtasks during Visit 2 ( Fig . 8 ) . There were not significant differences in the number of subtasks completed between conditions for either Visit 1 ( F ( 2 , 34 ) = 1 . 67 , p = 0 . 20 , η 2 = 0 . 09 ) or Visit 2 ( F ( 2 , 32 ) = 0 . 94 , p = 0 . 40 , η 2 = 0 . 06 ) .

Fig . 10 . Duration of test phase by completion of the task ; those who succeeded in repair took significantly less time ; error bars are SD . Fig . 11 . Test phase duration by condition ; VC participants often took significantly longer ; error bars = SD . The time participants spent repairing the circuit varied and was worth analyzing . Twenty minutes was the maximum time spent in a repairing circuit phase , and Fig . 9 and Fig . 10 show the average time for the successful and failed participants in each visit . The results show that participants took significantly more time to complete the test phase in Visit 1 ( M = 11 : 06 , SD = 07 : 39 ) than they did in Visit 2 ( M = 09 : 03 , SD = 05 : 30 ) , t ( 99 ) = 2 . 75 , p = 0 . 01 , d = 0 . 32 . Also , during Visit 1 , those who successfully completed the circuit task finished significantly more quickly than those who failed to complete the circuit , F ( 1 , 102 ) = 11 . 10 , p = 0 . 001 , d = 0 . 73 . The same pattern was observed during Visit 2 , F ( 1 , 101 ) = 10 . 83 , p = 0 . 001 , d = 0 . 63 . During Visit 1 , there was a significant difference in how long participants took to complete the test phase based on condition , F ( 2 , 101 ) = 7 . 98 , p = 0 . 001 . Follow - up contrasts revealed participants in the VC condition ( M = 14 : 29 , SD = 8 : 31 ) took significantly longer than those in the VR condition ( M = 09 : 28 , SD = 05 : 54 ; t ( 101 ) = 2 . 98 , p = 0 . 004 , d = 0 . 71 ) and in the F2F condition ( M = 08 : 23 , SD = 05 : 47 ; t ( 101 ) = 3 . 66 , p < 0 . 001 , d = 0 . 86 ) . Durations during Visit 2 are also significantly different , F ( 2 , 100 ) = 4 . 17 , p = 0 . 02 ; again , those in the VC condition ( M = 10 : 42 , SD = 5 : 07 ) took significantly longer than those in the VR condition ( M = 07 : 06 , SD = 04 : 04 ) , t ( 100 ) = 2 . 87 , p = 0 . 01 , d = 0 . 73 ) . No other comparisons were significant . 48 Authorized licensed use limited to the terms of the applicable license agreement with IEEE . Restrictions apply . V . D ISCUSSION The authors assumed that the VC condition would have a lower agency than VR and F2F conditions ( H1 ) , and VR condition would have a lower body ownership than VC and F2F conditions ( H2 ) . H1 was partially supported in that the results showed that VR had the highest level of agency . But the results did not support H2 in that the VR also had the highest level of body ownership among conditions . This difference may have resulted from the language in the VEQ questionnaire referring specifically to a sense of body ownership and agency of virtual avatars . While the VC condition should promoted high body ownership , the survey’s specific inquiries about virtual body ownership may have led ratings in the F2F and VC conditions to be lower because the participant had a virtual body only in the immersive VR condition . By treating the visits as an independent variable , this study analyzed the results of dependent variables on Visit 1 vs . Visit 2 . Based on the knowledge test and participants’ performance , there was a better performance in Visit 1 compared to Visit 2 . In the knowledge test , participants gave significantly more correct answers in Visit 1 compared to Visit 2 . This pattern is consistent when examining participants’ success at repairing the circuit during Visit 2 . While there was no specific difference between Visit 1 and Visit 2 in the number of the completed subtasks by failure participants , the substantial difference from these results is average task completion time . Although the authors expected participants to take longer during Visit 2 , results show that successful participants completed the task more quickly and had better performance . The reason for this distinction might be an increased level of confidence , so there was less hesitation on task completion . In the first visit , the participants were acquiring knowledge while in the second visit , they were recalling knowledge that was already retained . Therefore , this could result in a shorter task time for completing task time in the second visit . Regarding the effect of training condition ( VC , VR , and F2F ) , no significant differences were found when examining knowledge and number of the subtasks completed by the failed participants . However , regarding the task completion rate and test phase time , participants had better performance in VR and F2F than VC . This may be due to the greater levels of agency that may be gained from interactions within a virtual environment in the VR condition , and increased agency may also enhance the sense of being in the presence of the trainer in the VR condition [ 31 ] . This may also be the case for the more direct sense of being in the presence of the trainer in the F2F condition . Additionally , there were no significant differences between VR and F2F conditions in terms of task performance , which may indicate a higher similarity within these CMC contexts than the authors previously expected . There is a large body of prior VR training research that shows that VR is effective for training gross psychomotor skills [ 32 ] , [ 33 ] . In regards to knowledge acquisition , prior research has also shown that VR , when compared to F2F , leads to higher knowledge acquisition and faster retrieval [ 34 ] . Another thing to also note , even though the F2F condition was in - person , the scenario involved the same desktop environment interaction as the VC condition . It may be the case that the improved level of interaction from the immersive VR condition made up for the remote nature of the training when compared to the lower level of performance found in the VC condition . Overall , participants did better in both VR and F2F conditions when compared to the VC condition . VI . L IMITATIONS There are a few limitations to this study . One was using the VEQ in an attempt to measure physical body ownership and agency , while it is designed to be used with virtual embodiment . It is also noted that this research is missing a number of self - report measures that are typically seen in the VR domain . In particular , questionnaires on simulator sickness and presence were not administered . However , the focus of this research was to measure the effects of agency and body ownership on training effectiveness . VII . S UMMARY & F UTURE R ESEARCH In this study , the authors examined the effects of embodiment variation on training effectiveness . To achieve this goal , the digital electronics laboratory Circuit World was designed . The data of 106 participants were gathered in three different conditions with various levels of agency and body ownership , and the following conclusions are suggested for the future research based on the final results . ( 1 ) The retention of the knowledge does not seem affected by the levels of agency and body ownership as explored in this study . ( 2 ) The VR and F2F conditions have been shown to lead to similar task performance while there were some differences between these conditions and VC . This assumption could be a good topic for future research to find the task contexts that might lead to differences between the VR and F2F conditions . ( 3 ) Between the agency and body ownership , agency has a more dominant role in affecting the training effectiveness . Another worthy topic for future study could be considering self - location as the third component of embodiment and analyzing its effect on training effectiveness .
