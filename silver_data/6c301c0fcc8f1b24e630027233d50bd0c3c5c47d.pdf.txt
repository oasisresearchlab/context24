Ionic calcium ( Ca 2 (cid:2) ) is an essential signal for axon guidance that mediates opposing effects on growth cone motility . The diverse effects of Ca 2 (cid:2) arise from the precise localization of Ca 2 (cid:2) signals into microdomains containing specific Ca 2 (cid:2) effectors . For example , differencesinthemechanicalandchemicalcompositionoftheunderlyingsubstrataelicitlocalCa 2 (cid:2) signalswithingrowthcone filopodia that regulate axon guidance through activation of the protease calpain . However , how calpain regulates growth cone motility remains unclear . Here , we identify the adhesion proteins talin and focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) as proteolytic targets of calpain in Xenopus laevis spinal cord neurons both in vivo and in vitro . Inhibition of calpain increases the localization of endogenous adhesion signaling to growth cone filopodia . Using live cell microscopy and specific calpain - resistant point - mutants of talin ( L432G ) and FAK ( V744G ) , we find that calpain inhibits paxillin - based adhesion assembly through cleavage of talin and FAK , and adhesion disassembly through cleavage of FAK . Blocking calpain cleavage of talin and FAK inhibits repulsive turning from focal uncaging of Ca 2 (cid:2) within filopodia .

These data demonstrate that filopodial Ca 2 (cid:2) signals regulate axon outgrowth and guidance through calpain regulation of adhesion dynamics through specific cleavage of talin and FAK . Key words : extracellular matrix ; filopodia ; integrin ; paxillin ; Xenopus Introduction Development of the nervous system requires precise spatial and temporal guidance of axons to form a functional neural circuit . An essential component of extending axons is a sensory and mo - tile structure at the tip of the axon known as the growth cone . Studies have shown that growth cone motility is controlled in part through polymerization and depolymerization of two cyto - skeleton components , actin filaments and microtubules ( Lowery and Van Vactor , 2009 ; Dent et al . , 2011 ) . Less well understood are growth cone adhesion complexes , which link with the cytoskele - tontostabilizecellprotrusionsandprovidethenecessarytraction for growth cone advance and turning ( Kerstein et al . , 2015 ; Nichol et al . , 2016 ) . Growth cones form small and transient ad - hesions known as point contact adhesions that are dynamically controlled by axon guidance cues ( Myers et al . , 2011 ; Vitriol and Zheng , 2012 ) . A key component to adhesion - based guidance of axons is adhesion cycling . For example , attractive cues such as BDNF increase the formation and turnover of integrin - based ReceivedAug . 31 , 2016 ; revisedDec . 21 , 2016 ; acceptedDec . 29 , 2016 .

Understanding the intracellular signaling mechanisms that govern growth cone motility will clarify how the nervous system develops and regenerates , and may identify areas of therapeutic intervention in disease or injury . One important signal that controls growth cones is that of local Ca 2 (cid:2) transients , which control the rate and direction of axon outgrowth . We demonstrate here that Ca 2 (cid:2) - dependent inhibition axon outgrowth and guidance is mediated by calpain proteol - ysis of the adhesion proteins talin and focal adhesion kinase . Our findings provide mechanistic insight into Ca 2 (cid:2) / calpain regula - tion of growth cone motility and axon guidance during neuronal development . 1568 • TheJournalofNeuroscience , February8 , 2017 • 37 ( 6 ) : 1568 – 1580 adhesions ( Myers and Gomez , 2011 ) . Conversely , repulsive cues , such as Sema3A , EphrinA1 , and Slit2 , reduce the formation of adhesions and often stabilize existing adhesions to inhibit axon outgrowth or induce repulsive turning ( Woo and Gomez , 2006 ; Bechara et al . , 2008 ; Woo et al . , 2009 ; Myers et al . , 2012 ) . Adhe - sion assembly and turnover are regulated by signaling through the kinases Src , focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) , and p21 - associated kinase ( Robles and Gomez , 2006 ; Woo and Gomez , 2006 ; Woo et al . , 2009 ; Myers and Gomez , 2011 ; Santiago - Medina et al . , 2013 ) . While guidance cue receptors mediate some direct control over these kinases , it remains unclear whether additional biochemical signals mediate control over adhesion dynamics in growth cones . In migrating cells , ionic calcium ( Ca 2 (cid:2) ) is a critical biochem - ical regulator of cell polarity and motility ( Wei et al . , 2009 ) . One primary mechanism by which Ca 2 (cid:2) guides cell migration is through the Ca 2 (cid:2) - dependent cysteine protease calpain . Previous work suggests that Ca 2 (cid:2) and calpain regulate cell migration though the proteolytic degradation of cytoskeleton – integrin linkages ( Huttenlocher et al . , 1997 ) . Additional studies identified talin , an integrin adaptor protein , and FAK , an adhesion signal - ing protein , as two principal targets of calpain proteolysis , which , when cleaved , inhibit adhesion dynamics ( Franco et al . , 2004 ; Chan et al . , 2010 ) . Interestingly , recent studies suggest that neu - ronal morphology and growth cone motility are also regulated by calpain activity . In developing neurons , substratum adhesivity regulates local filopodial Ca 2 (cid:2) transients within growth cones ( Gomez et al . , 2001 ) and inhibits axon outgrowth by calpain - dependent disruption of tyrosine kinase signaling and talin local - ization ( Robles et al . , 2003 ; Kerstein et al . , 2013 ) . While previous studies have demonstrated a clear role for calpain activity in cell migration and axon development , the precise targets and under - lying mechanisms of calpain in the developing nervous system remain elusive . In this study , we investigated two possible targets of calpain proteoylsis within point contact adhesions talin and FAK . While calpain has previously been shown to cleave both talin and FAK in HEK293 cells in vitro ( Franco et al . , 2004 ; Chan et al . , 2010 ) ; here we show that cleavage of talin and FAK occurs naturally within the developing Xenopus spinal cord . Functionally , we show that calpain activation reduces adhesion signaling within growth cone filopodia and inhibits point contact adhesion dy - namics , by preventing adhesion formation and stabilizing exist - ing adhesions . Moreover , expressing calpain - resistant point mutants of talin ( L432G ) or FAK ( V744G ) in growth cones mod - ulates adhesion dynamics . Finally , inhibiting proteolysis of these key adhesion proteins blocks calpain - dependent growth cone turning in vitro and axon extension in vivo . While many studies have suggested an important role for Ca 2 (cid:2) signaling in growth cones , few have identified downstream Ca 2 (cid:2) effectors that regu - late the cytoskeleton to control axon guidance . This study de - scribes a precise mechanism for Ca 2 (cid:2) control over adhesion turnover to regulate axon guidance . Materials and Methods Expression constructs . When needed expression constructs were sub - cloned into the Xenopus - preferred pCS2 vector ( provided by Dave Turner , University of Michigan , Ann Arbor , MI ) . Human calpain1 H272A was provided by S . Kulkarni ( Cleveland Clinic Foundation , Cleveland , OH ) and was subcloned into pCS2 C - GFP ( Kulkarni et al . , 1999 ) . Chick paxillin - eGFP ( plasmid # 15233 , Addgene ; Laukaitis et al . , 2001 ) was provided by A . F . Horwitz ( University of Virginia , Charlottes - ville , VA ) and subcloned into pCS2 . Chick paxillin - tdTomato ( plasmid # 58123 , Addgene ) was provided by M . Davidson ( National Magnetic Field Laboratory , Florida State University , Tallahassee , FL ) . Mouse eGFP - talin L432G ( plasmid # 26725 , Addgene ; Franco et al . , 2004 ) , eGFP - FAK V744G , and TagRFP - FAK V744G ( Chan et al . , 2010 ) were provided by A . Huttenlocher ( University of Wisconsin , Madison , WI ) . Male and female Xenopus laevis embryos ( Nasco ) were obtained and staged as described previously ( Nieuwkoop and Faber , 1994 ; Go´mez et al . , 2003 ) . For experiments requiring plasmid expression , two to three blastomeres of eight - cell - stage embryos were injected with 50 – 75 pg of DNA constructs . For in vivo skin prep experiments , single dark blastom - eres of eight - cell - stage embryos were injected . Embryos that appeared grossly normal 24 h postfertilization ( hpf ) were used to make spinal cord explant cultures . Neural tube explant cultures containing neurons were prepared in a modified Ringer’s solution , as described previously ( Go´ - mez et al . , 2003 ) . Aminoglycoside antibiotics ( AGAs ) , gentamicin and streptomycin , are present in our culture media at a concentration of 100 (cid:2) M each for antimicrobial purposes . Explants were plated onto acid - washed coverslips coated with 25 (cid:2) g / ml laminin ( LN ; Sigma - Aldrich ) . Cultures were imaged or fixed 16 – 24 h after plating . Image acquisition and analysis . For fixed fluorescence microscopy , im - ages were acquired using a 60 (cid:3) / 1 . 45 numerical aperture ( NA ) or a 10 (cid:3) / 0 . 3 NA objective lens using a Olympus Fluoview 500 laser - scanning confocal system mounted on an AX - 70 upright microscope for in vitro and in vivo experiments , respectively . Olympus Fluoview software was used for image acquisition ( RRID : SRC _ 014215 ) . On the confocal sys - tem , fixed samples used for immunocytochemistry experiments were imaged with a 2 . 5 (cid:3) zoom ( pixel size , 165 nm ) . Measurements of filopo - dia immunofluorescence intensity of talin , vinculin , pY397 FAK , pY99 , and pY188 paxillin were made by first selecting the perimeter of growth cones from thresholded filamentous actin ( F - actin ) - labeled images based on intensity to exclude background . Furthermore , the centers of growth cones were removed manually from the selection mask to measure filopodiausingonlyFIJIopen - sourcesoftware ( RRID : SRC _ 002285 ) . These user - defined regions were then used to measure the average pixel inten - sity of immunolabeling within nonthresholded growth cone filopodia . For display purposes , some images were pseudocolored using FIJI lookup tables . For live cell adhesion fluorescence microscopy , images were captured using a 100 (cid:3) / 1 . 5 NA total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) objective lens on a Nikon TIRF microscope with a CoolSNAP HQ2 CCD camera ( Photometrics ) . Nikon MetaMorph software was used for image acquisition ( RRID : SRC _ 002368 ) . For all live cell adhe - sion experiments , explant cultures were sealed within perfusion cham - bers , as described previously ( Go´mez et al . , 2003 ) , to allow the rapid exchange of solutions . Time - lapse images of paxillin - GFP or paxillin - tdTomato puncta were captured at 5 s intervals for 10 min before and after the addition of 1 (cid:2) M calpastatin peptide inhibitor ( CPI ; Calbio - chem ) or the removal of AGAs . Only growth cones that did not collapse before or after pharmacological treatment were analyzed . Images were analyzed off - line using FIJI . Point contacts were identified as discrete puncta containing paxillin - GFP or paxillin - tdTomato that were at least two times brighter than the surrounding background and remained sta - tionary for at least 30 s ( Woo and Gomez , 2006 ) . For all figures , images were processed in Photoshop ( Adobe Systems ; RRID : SCR _ 014199 ) as follows : brightness levels were adjusted , an unsharp mask routine was applied to improve edge detection , and the images were converted to an 8 bit depth and cropped . Dynamic adhesion maps . Dynamic adhesion map images were pre - pared from image stacks using FIJI , as detailed previously ( Santiago - Medinaetal . , 2011 ) . Briefly , animagestabilizationalgorithmwasapplied ifnecessary , andtoimproveedgedetectionanunsharpmaskroutinewas applied , followed by thresholding to highlight the puncta of interest . Next , an 8 bit binary filter was applied to equalize point contact intensi - ties . Binary images were dilated by 1 pixel to improve the detection of smallpointcontactadhesions . Imagestackswerethenconvertedto16bit and summed so that intensity provides a measure of pixel lifetime . Final images were contrast enhanced and pseudocolored . Caged Ca 2 (cid:2) experiments . For focal Ca 2 (cid:2) uncaging experiments , a 100 (cid:3) / 1 . 40 NA objection lens was used on an Olympus Fluoview 500 laser - scanning confocal system mounted on an AX - 70 upright micro - scope . Neurons on LN were loaded for 45 min with 4 (cid:2) M NP - EGTA AM Kersteinetal . • CalpainRegulatesGrowthConeAdhesions J .

During turning assays , the leading edge of motile growth cones was po - sitioned 5 (cid:2) m from the region of UV light . Differential interference contrast or GFP fluorescence images were acquired every 15 s . Only growth cones that advanced 10 (cid:2) m during the imaging time period were used for off - line analysis of axon turning angles using FIJI software . In vivo skin preparation . Rohon – Beard ( RB ) peripheral axons were visualized in stage 25 – 26 embryos by isolating the dorsal skin by remov - ing the spinal cord and lateral somites . The skin whole - mounts were incubated with 1 : 500 anti - GFP ( Abcam ; RRID : AB _ 305564 ) and 1 : 500 anti - HNK - 1 antibody ( NCAM ; Sigma - Aldrich ; RRID : AB _ 1078474 ) to label RB axons . Multiple confocal fields of view of a single preparation were stitched together using the MosaicJ plugin within the FIJI software ( The´venaz and Unser , 2007 ) . For analysis of RB peripheral axon out - growth , the length of the longest RB axon was measured within 100 (cid:2) m segments and compared between the injected and uninfected sides of the skin , as described previously ( Robles and Gomez , 2006 ; Moon and Gomez , 2010 ) .

For immunocytochemistry experiments , spinal neuron cultures were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde in Krebs sucrose fixative ( Dent and Meiri , 1992 ) , permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , and blocked in 1 . 0 % fish gelatin in calcium – magnesium - free PBS for 1 h at room temperature . Primary antibodies were used at the following dilutions in blocking solution : 1 : 500 talin ( Thermo Fisher ; RRID : AB _ 2204008 ) , 1 : 500 vinculin ( Sigma - Aldrich ; RRID : AB _ 477629 ) , 1 : 500 pY397 FAK ( Thermo Fisher ; RRID : AB _ 2533701 ) , 1 : 500 pY99 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ; RRID : AB _ 628123 ) , and 1 : 500 phospho - Y118 paxillin ( Thermo Fisher ; RRID : AB _ 2533733 ) antibodies . Alexa Fluor - conjugated secondary an - tibodies were purchased from Invitrogen and used at 1 : 250 in blocking solution ( RRID : AB _ 141514 , RRID : AB _ 143165 , RRID : AB _ 141370 , RRID : AB _ 143051 ) .

Results Calpain - mediated proteolysis of talin and FAK in the developing spinal cord and in growth cones To investigate the targets of calpain - mediated proteolysis in de - veloping neurons , we first confirmed the presence of conven - tional calpain transcripts in developing Xenopus spinal cords expressed by RT - PCR from stage 22 spinal cord mRNA . We found that the proteolytic subunits calpain1 ( (cid:2) - calpain ) and cal - pain2 ( m - calpain ) , and the regulatory subunit calpain small sub - unit 1 ( calpainSS1 , calpain4 ) are expressed at this stage of robust axon extension ( Fig . 1 a ) . Next , we took a candidate approach by selecting likely calpain targets identified in migrating non - neuronal cells . The migration of fibroblasts is disrupted by per - turbations in calpain function through proteolysis and degradation of adhesion and cytoskeletal components ( Hutten - locher et al . , 1997 ) . Two of the main targets within adhesion complexes are the scaffolding protein talin and the tyrosine ki - nase FAK ( Franco et al . , 2004 ; Chan et al . , 2010 ) . In previous studies , calpain - mediated proteolysis of talin and FAK was ana - lyzed in human cell lines . Therefore , we first examined whether the calpain cleavage sites of talin and FAK were conserved in X . laevis and then tested whether cleavage of these proteins occurs in primary neurons ( Fig . 1 b , c ) . To assess whether talin and FAK were cleaved in the developing spinal cord , we collected stage 22 spinal cord lysates . At this stage , neurons are actively extending axons in the spinal cord ( Robles and Gomez , 2006 ; Moon and Gomez , 2010 ) . By Western blot , talin appears as a 230 kDa full - length band , a 190 kDa rod fragment band , and a 120 kDa Vinculin - Actin - Dimerization domain fragment ( Fig . 1 d ) . All bands appear as doublets , since this antibody recognizes both isoforms of talin . Importantly , we know these talin fragments are due to calpain cleavage since the inhibition of calpain by incubat - ing the spinal cords for 30 min in 1 (cid:2) M CPI reduces talin cleavage by (cid:5) 70 % relative to the DMSO control ( Fig . 1 d ) . Western blots labeled for FAK show a 116 kDa full - length band and an 80 kDa cleaved fragment , which are reduced by (cid:5) 60 % relative to the control after inhibition of calpain ( Fig . 1 e ) . These data demon - strate that talin and FAK are cleaved by calpain in developing spinal cord lysates , suggesting a possible role for calpain during axon extension and pathfinding . While analysis of spinal cord lysates demonstrates calpain cleavage of proteins in native conditions , they do not prove pro - teolysis occurs within growth cones . Therefore , we used immu - nocytochemistry for key adhesion proteins and phosphorylation sites to determine whether changes in calpain activity modulated adhesion protein localization and signaling in growth cones . We first assessed localization of three different adhesion proteins and phosphorylation sites that have previously been shown to localize to growth cone filopodia , as follows : talin ; an active form of FAK ( pY397 FAK ) ; and a point contact adhesion marker pY118 pax - illin ( Robles and Gomez , 2006 ; Woo and Gomez , 2006 ; Kerstein et al . , 2013 ; Fig . 2 a , d , g ) . We quantified the immunofluorescence signal intensity within individual filopodia instead of entire growth cones , as dynamic Ca 2 (cid:2) , calpain , and adhesion signals are mostrobustinfilopodia ( Roblesetal . , 2003 ; Kersteinetal . , 2013 ) . First , we inhibited calpain activity with 1 (cid:2) M CPI for 30 min 1570 • J . Neurosci . , February8 , 2017 • 37 ( 6 ) : 1568 – 1580 Kersteinetal . • CalpainRegulatesGrowthConeAdhesions before fixation and found that talin , pY397 FAK , and pY118 pax - illin all increased in fluorescence intensity within filopodia ( Fig . 2 b , e , h , j ) . Next , we acutely activated calpain in a Ca 2 (cid:2) - dependent mannerbyremovingAGAsfromtheculturemedia30minbeforefixation . Previous studies have shown that AGAs , which are com - mon cell culture antibiotics , also inhibit mechanosensitive ion channels ( Kerstein et al . , 2013 ) . Furthermore , acute removal of AGAs elicits filopodial Ca 2 (cid:2) transients in a robust and reproduc - ible manner . Removal of AGAs acts on growth cone motility through the disinhibition of mechanosensitive transient receptor potential canonical member 1 ( TRPC1 ) channels that selectively and directly activate calpain through local Ca 2 (cid:2) influx ( Kerstein et al . , 2013 ) . When we activated calpain through acute removal of AGAs for 30 min before fixation , we found a reduction in talin , pY397 FAK , and pY118 paxillin fluorescence intensity in growth cone filopodia ( Fig . 2 c , f , i , j ) . In addition , we found a similar calpain - dependent trend for the fluorescent intensity of other adhesions signaling markers , such as the talin binding protein vinculin and total tyrosine phosphorylation ( Fig . 2 j ) , which we have previously shown to be highly localized to point contact adhesions ( Robles et al . , 2005 ) . To support our pharmacological manipulations , we expressed a catalytically inactive calpain1 ( capn1 - H272A ) mutant in spinal neurons . Capn1 - H272A has previously been shown to act as a dominant negative , as it competes with endogenous calpain1 and calpain2 for binding to the regulatory and activating subunit , calpain small subunit 1 ( Capns1 , Capn4 ; Kulkarni et al . , 1999 ) .

Neurosci . , February8 , 2017 • 37 ( 6 ) : 1568 – 1580 • 1571 neurons shows that it localizes to neuronal growth cones and reduces protease activity ( data not shown ) . Growth cones ex - pressing capn1 - H272A exhibited a significantly higher fluores - cence intensity of talin and pY118 paxillin in filopodia , consistent with pharmacological inhibition of calpain ( Fig . 2 k ) . However , while pY397 FAK showed a similar increase in filopodial localiza - tion , this increase was not statistically significant ( Fig . 2 k ) . These data suggest that calpain cleaves adhesion proteins within the developing spinal cord and within growth cone filopodia to reduce adhesion signaling , and therefore may regulate specific aspects of point contact adhesion dynamics in motile growth cones . Calpain activity regulates point contact adhesion dynamics in neuronal growth cones We precisely measure point contact assembly frequency and du - ration from live paxillin - GFP - expressing growth cones imaged at high temporal and spatial resolutions with TIRF microscopy ( Woo et al . , 2009 ; Myers and Gomez , 2011 ) .

Since calpain inhibition in - creases axon outgrowth ( Robles et al . , 2003 ; Kerstein et al . , 2013 ) and increases adhesion signaling within filopodia ( Fig . 2 ) , we hypothesized that calpain inhibition would promote point con - tact turnover .

To validate our pharmacological findings , we coexpressed dominant - negative mCherry - capn1 - H272A and paxillin - GFP in spinal neurons to assess growth cone adhesion dynamics during chronic calpain inhibition ( Fig . 4 c , d ) .

In addition , the activation of filopodial Ca 2 (cid:2) transients by AGA removal had no effect on adhesion dynamics in growth cones expressing dominant - negative calpain1 ( Fig . 5 ) .

Furthermore , we concluded that calpain activity inhib - its integrin - dependent adhesion signaling and point contact cy - cling . While previous studies have linked calpain and Src tyrosine kinase signaling in the growth cones ( Robles et al . , 2003 ) , this is the first study to demonstrate that calpain regulates specific as - pects of point contact adhesion dynamics in growth cones . Calpain differentially regulates adhesion assembly and disassembly through proteolysis of talin and FAK To determine how calpain - targeted proteolysis of talin and FAK ( Fig . 1 ) regulates adhesion dynamics , we expressed mutant forms of talin ( L432G ) and FAK ( V744G ) that are resistant to calpain proteolysis . These mutants were used to assess the specific effects of the proteolysis of talin and FAK on adhesion dynamics . Both talin and FAK mutants have previously been shown to resist cal - pain proteolysis , while maintaining their function and protein – protein interactions within the adhesion complex ( Franco et al . , 2004 ; Chan et al . , 2010 ) . In addition , mutant talin and FAK pro - teins correctly localize to point contact adhesions when expressed in neuronal growth cones ( data not shown ) . We hypothesized that the expression of noncleavable talin would increase adhesion assembly , as talin is important for inside - out activation of integ - rin receptors ( Tadokoro et al . , 2003 ) . To test this hypothesis , we coexpressed GFP - talin - L432G with paxillin - tdTomato to analyze the changes in adhesions dynamics when calpain was unable to cleave talin . As predicted , the expression of talin - L432G signifi - cantly increased point contact adhesion assembly by 23 . 6 % com - pared with growth cones expressing wild - type talin ( Fig . 4 e , f , i ) . Next , we hypothesized that expressing the calpain - resistant FAK mutant would decrease point contact duration , as our laboratory previously showed that FAK promotes point contact turnover ( Myers and Gomez , 2011 ) . Interestingly , we found that the ex - pression of FAK - V744G increased the frequency of point contact assembly by 30 . 2 % and decreased point contact duration by 40 . 0 % compared with growth cones expressing wild - type FAK ( Fig . 4 g – j ) . Finally , we found that , unlike the expression of wild - type proteins , the expression of either talin - L432G or FAK - V744G blocked the effects of filopodial Ca 2 (cid:2) transients ( (cid:8) AGAs ) on point contact adhesion dynamics ( Fig . 5 a , b ) . Altogether , these data suggest that Ca 2 (cid:2) - activated calpain suppresses adhesion as - sembly through cleavage of both talin and FAK , and stabilizes adhesions through the cleavage of FAK . Filopodial Ca 2 (cid:2) transients guide neuronal growth cones by calpain - mediated proteolysis of talin and FAK We have previously shown that filopodial Ca 2 (cid:2) transients gener - ated on one side of growth cones are sufficient to induce calpain - dependent repulsive turning ( Gomez et al . , 2001 ; Robles et al . , 2003 ) . Here we wanted to determine whether calpain - mediated proteolysis of talin and FAK are also required for Ca 2 (cid:2) - dependent growth cone turning . To address this question , we measured the turning responses of growth cones expressing GFP , GFP - capn1 - H272A , GFP - talin - L432G , or GFP - FAK - V744G to focal release of caged Ca 2 (cid:2) . After 45 min , wild - type ( NP - EGTA - loaded ) growth cones turn an average 21 . 7 (cid:4) 3 . 4° compared with unloaded control growth cones exposed to the same UV light pulses , which turn an average of 12 . 9 (cid:4) 2 . 7° ( Fig . 6 a , e , f ) . These results are consistent with previous observations of axon turning angles by caged Ca 2 (cid:2) release in growth cone filopodia ( Gomez et al . , 2001 ) . Moreover , the response to caged Ca 2 (cid:2) release was abolished in growth cones expressing dominant - negative capn1 - H272A ( Fig . 6 e , f ) , which is consistent with previous findings using pharmacological inhibition of calpain ( Robles et al . , 2003 ) . Interestingly , repulsive turning was also abolished in growth cones expressing either calpain - resistant talin - L432G ( Fig . 6 c , e , f ) or calpain - resistant FAK - V744G ( Fig . 6 d – f ) . The expression of either mutant protein had no significant effect on the rate of axon outgrowth ( Fig . 6 g ) . These results demonstrate that preventing calpain - mediated proteolysis of just one adhesion protein is suf - ficient to prevent repulsive turning in Ca 2 (cid:2) - dependent manner . This suggests that repulsive axon guidance cues may also signal through this Ca 2 (cid:2) / calpain to elicit their effects in vivo . Calpain - mediated proteolysis regulates Rohon – Beard peripheral axon extension in vivo To assess whether calpain - mediated cleavage of adhesion pro - teins regulates axon outgrowth in vivo , we used an RB skin prep - aration to quantify the growth and guidance of sensory neuron peripheral axons in Xenopus embryos . We chose these axons for in vivo analysis because they extend and branch along the basal Figure5 .

For these studies , we coinjected cDNA - encoding mutant constructs and GFP mRNA into one ventral blastomere at the eight - cell blastula stage ( Fig . 7 a ; Robles and Gomez , 2006 ) . Based on developmental fate maps , this drives expression into one side of the dorsal spinal cord and the skin ( Fig . 7 b ) . After 24 h , RB peripheral axons were visualized with HNK - 1 antibody labeling in an open - book skin preparation . This techniqueallowedustocomparedifferencesbetweentheinjectedsideandtheuninjectedcontrolsideofembryos ( Fig . 7 c – g ) . When GFP alone was expressed on one side of embryos , we observed no difference in axon extension between the injected and control sides ( Fig . 7 c , h ) . In contrast , we found that peripheral axons ex - pressing GFP - capn1 - H272A were significantly longer on the injected side versus the control side ( Fig . 7 f , h ) . Interestingly , neither expression of GFP - talin - L432G ( Fig . 7 e ) nor GFP - FAK - V744G alone ( Fig . 7 f ) were sufficient to phenocopy the expression of dominant - negative calpain1 . However , when GFP - talin - L432G and TagRFP - FAK - V744G were expressed together on the same side of the embryo , we observed a similar enhancement of axon outgrowth phenotype compared with the calpain1 mutant em - bryos ( Fig . 7 g , h ) . Therefore , disruption of a single calpain sub - strate can affect adhesion dynamics and in vitro turning assays , but the cleavage of multiple substrates is required to affect more complex cell behaviors , such as axon outgrowth in vivo . In addi - tion to enhanced axon lengths , we observed an increase in RB axon branching in embryos expressing dominant - negative cal - pain . However , we did not observe this phenotype in embryos expressing the talin and / or FAK mutants ( Fig . 7 i ) . This suggests that calpain suppresses axon branching through proteolysis of a different target , such as the actin binding protein cortactin ( Mingorance - Le Meur and O’Connor , 2009 ) . Discussion The goal of this study was to determine how Ca 2 (cid:2) signals direct calpain cleavage in filopodia to control growth cone motility . Previous work using fibroblast cell lines demonstrated that local Figure6 .

In agreement with these findings , we identified the adhesion proteins talin and FAK as targets of calpain proteolysis in cells isolated from the developing spinal cord ( Fig . 1 ) . We further show that calpain regulates the localization and activity of talin , FAK , and other components of integrin - based point contact adhesions of growth cones ( Fig . 2 ) . Interestingly , we find that calpain differentially regulates point contact adhesion assembly and disassembly through the cleavage of talin and FAK , respectively ( Figs . 3 , 4 , 5 ) . Further , we show that the cleavage of talin and FAK in growth cones is necessary for Ca 2 (cid:2) - dependent repulsive turning ( Fig . 6 ) . These data suggest that Ca 2 (cid:2) / calpain activity mediates repulsive turning through asymmetrical adhesion turnover by cleaving of talin and FAK ( Fig . 8 ) . Finally , we demonstrated that proper regulation of cal - pain function and cleavage of talin and FAK is required for nor - mal extension of RB peripheral axons into the developing skin ( Fig . 7 ) . These data suggest that calpain has important roles in integrin - dependent adhesion , growth cone motility , and axon guidance in vitro and in vivo . An intriguing result from this study is the differential effects of calpain - resistant talin ( L432G ) and FAK ( V744G ) on growth cone adhesion dynamics . We find that under basal conditions , calpain - resistant FAK affected both adhesion formation and du - ration in growth cones , but calpain - resistant talin affected only adhesion formation ( Fig . 4 i , j ) . While calpain - resistant FAK and talin differentially affect adhesions , each is sufficient to block Figure7 . InhibitionofcalpainactivitypromotesRBperipheralaxonoutgrowth insitu .

Neurosci . , February8 , 2017 • 37 ( 6 ) : 1568 – 1580 • 1577 repulsive turning to local Ca 2 (cid:2) uncaging . One explanation for this is that , under stimulated conditions , calpain - resistant talin blocks Ca 2 (cid:2) - dependent changes on both adhesion formation and duration , which is consistent with our observations after global activation of calpain by AGA removal ( Figs . 5 a , b , 8 ) . Talin may affect adhesion duration indirectly by binding FAK , which may be disrupted by calpain only under stimulated conditions . However , it is important to note that due to the limitations of imaging the precise spatiotemporal dynamics of growth cone ad - hesions , we could be missing some subtle changes in growth cone adhesion dynamics induced by the expression of talin and FAK mutants . For example , better temporal resolution would allow us to more accurately calculate adhesion kinetics , such as rate con - stants for assembly and disassembly of adhesions . Future ad - vances in imaging technologies and fluorophores will likely allow us to determine such adhesion parameters and clarify our work - ing model for growth cone adhesion dynamics . A major open cell biological question is whether calpain pro - teolysis leads to degradation or modulation of specific target pro - teins . Unlike degradative proteases , analysis of (cid:9) 100 substrate target sequences of calpain proteolysis did not reveal a clear con - sensus sequence ( Tompa et al . , 2004 ) . This led to the hypothesis that calpain proteolysis is based on secondary and tertiary struc - tures of target proteins , as calpain commonly cleaves proteins between modulatory domains , leading many to suggest that cal - pain modulates protein function rather than degrading proteins ( Franco and Huttenlocher , 2005 ) . For example , the head domain of talin is important for the activation of integrins during adhe - sion assembly ( Calderwood et al . , 1999 ) , and studies using cell - free in vitro assays show that the talin head domain alone has a sixfold higher binding affinity for (cid:3) - integrins compared with full - length talin ( Yan et al . , 2001 ) . Furthermore , structural evi - dence suggests that full - length talin auto - inhibits the talin head domain , preventing binding and activation of integrins ( Goksoy et al . , 2008 ; Saltel et al . , 2009 ) . Therefore , it is possible that calpain proteolysisactivatestalinfunctionbyrelievingtalinauto - inhibition . Recent evidence in non - neuronal cells suggests that the talin head proteolytic fragment is essential for adhesion assembly , cell spreading , and membrane protrusion . However , in basal cell conditions the talin head fragment is rapidly ubiquitinated and degraded by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Smurf1 , and only during specific cell - signaling events is Smurf1 blocked from ubiquitinating talin pro - teolytic fragments ( Huang et al . , 2009 ) . A similar mechanism may occur in developing axons , as Smurf1 activity is modulated inthepresenceofextracellularaxonguidancecues , suchasBDNF ( Cheng et al . , 2011 ) . Although less well studied , calpain proteolysis of FAK may also produce functional protein fragments . Calpain cleaves FAK between the kinase and focal adhesion targeting ( FAT ) domain , leaving the kinase domain functional but without proper local - ization ( Fig . 1 c ) . TheFATdomainfragmentresemblestheendog - enous dominant - negative version of FAK known as FAK - related nonkinase ( FRNK ; Chan et al . , 2010 ) . Interestingly , overexpres - sion of FRNK reduces point contact adhesion cycling in neuronal growth cones ( Myers and Gomez , 2011 ) , prevents the response to attractive guidance cues ( Li et al . , 2004 ) , and modulates both axon extension and branching in vivo ( Rico et al . , 2004 ; Robles and Gomez , 2006 ) . In contrast , the expression of calpain - resistant talin and FAK did not prevent axon extension , rather it enhanced outgrowth in vivo , which is consistent with the notion that calpain normally suppresses motility by the generation of inhibitory protein fragments ( Fig . 7 e – h ) . Importantly , our bio - chemical analyses suggest that the proteolytic fragments of talin and FAK are rapidly degraded , as they are almost completely lost after 30 min of calpain inhibition ( Fig . 1 d , e ) . The regulation of fragment degradation may provide another level of control of growth cone motility downstream of guidance cues . Another open question is how calpain1 and calpain2 function differs in neuronal growth cones . The experiments in this study do not distinguish between the two subunits , but these key cal - pain family members may have different or even opposite effects on neuronal signaling , as described previously for synaptic plas - ticity ( for review , see Baudry and Bi , 2016 ) . Distinct functional effects of specific calpain subunits may result from differences in their proteolytic targets . In addition , calpain1 and calpain2 are activated by low ( 5 – 10 (cid:2) M ) and high ( 0 . 2 – 0 . 5 m M ) concentra - tions of Ca 2 (cid:2) , respectively . Therefore , it is possible that calpain1 may mediate the cleavage of talin and FAK under basal condi - tions ( low Ca 2 (cid:2) activity ) , while calpain2 may only be active un - der stimulated conditions ( high Ca 2 (cid:2) activity ) . These possible differences between upstream and downstream calpain pathways suggest that calpain signaling in growth cones is more complex than previously described , which provides interesting open ques - tions for future studies . Many axon guidance cues may signal through the modulation of calpain activity to regulate growth cone motility and axon Figure8 .

Neurosci . , February8 , 2017 • 37 ( 6 ) : 1568 – 1580 Kersteinetal . • CalpainRegulatesGrowthConeAdhesions guidance . Some repulsive guidance cues , such as Slit - 2 and myelin - associated glycoprotein , affect motility by activating Ca 2 (cid:2) influx through plasma membrane ion channels ( Henley et al . , 2004 ; Guan et al . , 2007 ) , which may activate calpain down - stream . Interestingly , our previous work suggests that Slit mod - ulates point contact adhesion dynamics in a manner that is very similar to that of calpain activation ( Fig . 2 ; Myers et al . , 2012 ) . In addition , while Semaphorin 3A ( Sema3A ) is considered a Ca 2 (cid:2) - independent repulsive axon guidance cue ( Song et al . , 1998 ) , it does activate calpain through phosphorylation by MAPK and not Ca 2 (cid:2) influx ( Qin et al . , 2010 ) . Attractive axon guidance cues may also signal through calpain by suppressing rather than promoting calpain activity . For example , recent work demonstrated that precrossing spinal commissural interneurons ( CIs ) exhibit high calpain activity , which is reduced in response to the midline GDNF in postcrossing CIs ( Nawabi et al . , 2010 ; Charoy et al . , 2012 ) . At the midline , calpain is thought to act on guidance cue receptors to modulate responsiveness to particular environmen - tal cues ( Charoy et al . , 2012 ) . In addition , calpain proteolysis of adhesion proteins may be modulated in response to growth - promoting guidance cues . For example , the inhibition of calpain leads to similar changes in point contact adhesion cycling , as has been observed in response to BDNF ( Myers and Gomez , 2011 ) . Netrin - 1 also regulates growth cone motility through the regula - tion of adhesion signaling ( Li et al . , 2004 ; Liu et al . , 2004 ; Ren et al . , 2004 ) . Interestingly , both BDNF and Netrin regulate growth cone behavior by modulating Ca 2 (cid:2) signaling via TRPC channels ( Li et al . , 2005 ; Shim et al . , 2005 ; Wang and Poo , 2005 ) . However , this is counterintuitive , since we recently showed that Ca 2 (cid:2) in - flux through TRPC1 - containing channels activates calpain ( Ker - stein et al . , 2013 ) . One explanation for this discrepancy may be cyclic nucleotide signaling , which is known to act in parallel with Ca 2 (cid:2) signals . Previous studies have shown that cAMP can act as a molecular switch between Ca 2 (cid:2) effectors CaMKII and calcineu - rin to control attractive and repulsive turning , respectively ( Song etal . , 1998 ; Wenetal . , 2004 ) . Inaddition , cAMP / proteinkinaseA can directly inhibit calpain function by phosphorylation at S369 ( Shiraha et al . , 2002 ) . Therefore , while Ca 2 (cid:2) activates all of these signaling pathways , differential signals may arise through cyclic nucleotide - dependent regulation of the Ca 2 (cid:2) effectors calcineu - rin , CaMKII , and calpain . In addition to chemical guidance cues , mechanical cues may also regulate axon outgrowth and guidance by Ca 2 (cid:2) and calpain signaling . Recently , we hypothesized that Ca 2 (cid:2) signals may pro - vide homeostatic feedback to point contact adhesions ( Kerstein et al . , 2015 ) . For example , filopodial Ca 2 (cid:2) transients and mecha - nosensitive channels are modulated by ECM substratum rigidity and regulate axon outgrowth and guidance through Ca 2 (cid:2) - dependent activation of calpain ( Kerstein et al . , 2013 ) . Further - more , we demonstrated that filopodial Ca 2 (cid:2) transients inhibit point contact adhesion dynamics via calpain - mediated proteoly - sis of talin and FAK ( Figs . 4 , 5 , 6 ) . These new data suggest a mechanical inhibitory feedback mechanism among integrin , Ca 2 (cid:2) , calpain , and point contact adhesion proteins . This mech - anism in growth cones may also affect axon extension and guid - ance in vivo , because RB peripheral axon outgrowth is strongly modulated by perturbations to calpain proteolysis of adhesion proteins ( Fig . 7 ) . Our model suggests that Ca 2 (cid:2) and calpain in - hibit normal adhesion dynamics to regulate axon outgrowth and repulsive turning ( Fig . 8 ) . However , while our model fits the experimental conditions presented in this study , it is likely that the functional relevance of this mechanism varies depending on the environmental conditions in vitro and in vivo .
