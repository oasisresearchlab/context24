The expression plasmid pCsqR was transformed into E . coli BL21 , and CsqR was expressed by the addition of IPTG in the middle of the exponential phase and purified using the published procedure . 18 The purity of CsqR was more than 95 % as judged by SDS - PAGE . 19 Gel shift assay Gel shift assay was performed according to the published procedure . 19 - 20 The 167 bp - long probe of yihU / yihV intergenic region was generated by PCR amplification using a pair of primers ( yihUV - F ; CGCGGATCCAACCCTCTCCTGAATACAGT and yihUV - R ; CGCGGATCCGGTCATTCCTTAAACATTTTG ) and Ex Taq DNA polymerase ( Takara ) .

The electron beam - deposited tips were fabricated using ferrocene powder and these were used in AFM imaging to obtain high - resolution images . All AFM images were viewed and analyzed by Kodec 4 . 4 . 7 . 39 . 22 A low - pass filter and a flattening filter were applied to individual images to remove spike noise and to make the xy - plane flat , respectively .
