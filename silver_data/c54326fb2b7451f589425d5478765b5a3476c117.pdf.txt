The main one is that those networks are scale - free , that is that the distribution of the vertex degrees follows a power - law . Among the existing models , the ones which fit those characteristics best are based on a time evolution which makes impossible the analytic calculation of the number of motifs in the network . Focusing on applications , this calculation is very important to decompose networks in a modular manner , as proposed by Milo et al . . On the contrary , models whose construction does not depend on time , miss one orseveralpropertiesofrealnetworksorarenotcomputationallytractable .

Most real networks , including biological ones , share some common characteristics . Several articles , for instance [ 11 , 21 ] , give a complete overview of those features , which are : • Real networks are tree - like : The number of edges grows linearly with the number n of nodes . • They have a giant component : They may be divided into several connected components but one of them represents the major part of the network . • They show the small - world property : The diameter of the networks scales in O ( log n ) , that is two nodes of the same component can always be linked by a short path . • They are scale - free : The degree distribution follows a power - law . It is a consequence of the non - uniformity of the connectivity structure , most of the nodes having only a few links and a small number of them having a large number of links . • The clustering coefficient is high : This coefficient measures the aggregative trend of the nodes ( see Section 6 for a formal definition ) . Itismuchhigherinrealnetworksthaninrandomones , showingtheirtendencytobelocallyhighlyconnected . To go beyond global features and uncover the structure of complex networks , Milo et al . [ 16 ] propose to study the frequency of network motifs , that is to determine the topological subgraphs of small size that are over - represented in real networks . That modular decomposition of networks is used to emphasize several biological phenomena [ 3 , 16 , 17 ] .

Random graph models , which were already used to describe biological networks can be classified into three main categories . The first type is the Erdős – Rényi model [ 10 ] where edges are independent and identically distributed . However , such graphs exhibit a Poisson - law for the degrees and their clustering coefficient tends to zero when the network grows . Recent works propose to overcome those difficulties using a mixture of Erdős – Rényi graphs [ 8 ] . ∗ Fax : + 33 160873809 .

Birmelé / Discrete Applied Mathematics 157 ( 2009 ) 2267 – 2284 Molloy and Reed [ 18 ] proposed a model , also known as the configuration model [ 20 ] , generating graphs of given degree sequence . That model , which is now well - studied and enriched [ 1 , 6 , 19 , 18 , 20 , 21 ] , generates scale - free graphs for well - chosen degree - sequence , but it seems hard to obtain better than approximate formulas for the motif counts [ 13 ] . Moreover , that model needs as many parameters as distinct degrees in the network , which makes exact calculation computationally untractable . The third family of models uses the idea of preferential attachment introduced by Albert and Barabási [ 2 ] . Those models are based on an time evolution which has a mechanistic interpretation , that is the vertices are introduced one after another and attach preferentially to vertices having already a high degree . Analytic motif count is quasi - impossible in such networks as the topology of the final graph depends on the topology of every intermediate graph . In this paper , we propose a new model for generating random graphs . This model satisfies both the listed properties of real networks and the condition of time - invariance . Moreover , as it depends on only three parameters , calculations are tractable and it represents a possibility of determining the law of the frequency of a motif . It is based on a bipartite graph structure , which was used by Newman [ 20 ] and Guillaume and Latapy [ 11 , 12 ] who respectively built a configuration model and a preferential attachment model based on this structure . The main idea of this structure is to consider an intermediate graph for which the vertices can be divided into two sets ⊥ and (cid:62) such that every edge links a vertex of ⊥ to a vertex of (cid:62) . The final graph is then obtained by keeping only the vertices of ⊥ and linking two of them if they have a common neighbour in the intermediate graph . The actors’ network , where two actors are linked if they are co - starring in a movie , is the most popular example of that transformation : it is clearly obtained from the bipartite graph where ⊥ is the set of actors , (cid:62) the set of movies and ( a , m ) is an edge if actor a played in movie m . It is less clear that biological networks have an underlying bipartite structure and its’ use may be seen only as an algorithmic facility . Nevertheless , some biological networks have an underlying bipartite structure which makes sense . For example , metabolic networks [ 14 , 15 ] show a bipartite structure : the substrates are the bottom vertices and the reactions , characterized by their enzymes , are the top vertices . Each reaction is then linked to its substrates and products , generating a bipartite graph . We give the main lines of the bipartite graph structure in Section 1 . We describe our model in Section 2 and show that the obtained graphs fullfill the global features in Sections 3 – 6 . As metabolic reactions can be considered as non reversible , we describe briefly in Section 7 how to extend the model to directed graphs . Some mathematical proofs are rather technical or long to developp . We then just give a sketch of the proof in the main text , and invite the interested reader to refer to the Appendix for a detailed version . In Sections 1 – 6 , networks are modelled by single non - oriented graphs , that is the edges are non - ordered pairs of vertices and cannot be multiple . For every graph G , we denote by V ( G ) its sets of vertices , by E ( G ) its set of edges and by n ( G ) and e ( G ) the cardinalities of those sets . For every vertex u ∈ V ( G ) , we define the neighbourhood N G ( u ) of u in G to be the set of vertices v ∈ V ( G ) such that u v ∈ E ( G ) and denote by d G ( u ) its cardinality , which is the degree of u in G . When no confusion is possible , we might omit the reference to G and use the notations V , E , n , e , N ( u ) and d ( u ) , respectively . We say that almost every graph satisfies a property P if the probability of a graph on n vertices to satisfy P tends to one when n tends to infinity . 1 . Bipartite structure In this section , we introduce the underlying bipartite structure of a graph G , on which our model is based . The role played by that structure in the modelling of complex networks was already emphasized in [ 11 , 12 ] . Let us give the definition of a bipartite graph as well as the notations and vocabulary suggested in those articles . 1 . 1 . Bipartite graphs A bipartite graph is a triple H = ( (cid:62) , ⊥ , E ) where (cid:62) and ⊥ are two disjoint sets of vertices , respectively the top and bottom vertices , and E ⊆ (cid:62) × ⊥ is the set of edges . The difference with classical graphs is that every edge goes from (cid:62) to ⊥ . In particular , every cycle is even . In the following , we will use the letter H to symbolize bipartite graphs and the letter G for classical graphs . For H = ( (cid:62) , ⊥ , E ) a bipartite graph , we call bottom vertices ( resp . top vertices ) the vertices of ⊥ ( resp . (cid:62) ) . 1 . 2 . ⊥ - projection of a bipartite graph The ⊥ - projection of a bipartite graph H = ( (cid:62) , ⊥ , E ) is the graph G = ( ⊥ , E (cid:48) ) where ( u , v ) is in E (cid:48) if u and v are both connected to a same top node in H . Note that an edge ( u , v ) ∈ G can be obtained twice or more since u and v can have several common neighbors in H . Nevertheless , we will not deal with multiple edges and consider ( u , v ) as a single edge even if u and v have several common neighbours in H ( Fig . 1 ) . E . Birmelé / Discrete Applied Mathematics 157 ( 2009 ) 2267 – 2284 2269 1 . 3 . Recovering the bipartite structure of a classical graph Finding an underlying bipartite structure of a classical graph G is a clique covering problem : finding the smallest one is thus NP - hard . Nevertheless , the authors of [ 12 ] propose an algorithm which , given a classical graph G , constructs an underlying bipartite graph H having the following properties : – the number of top - vertices is of the same order than the the number of bottom - vertices – most of the largest cliques contained in G are represented in H , that is there exists a top vertex which is a common neighbour of all the vertices of the clique . Those requirements ensure to build a bipartite graph which really gives structural informations about G and not a trivial bipartite graph having a top - node for every edge of G . Moreover , applying that algorithm to biological networks , they notice that : – the degrees of the bottom vertices of H follow a power - law distribution – the degrees of the top vertices of H exhibit a Poisson behavior . The model we propose in that article doesn’t use the recovering of the bipartite structure . However , it is built to follow the former properties . 2 . The model In this section , we make our random graph model for generating scale - free graphs explicit . These graphs are built in two steps : first , we generate a random bipartite graph and second , we take its ⊥ - projection . 2 . 1 . Truncated power law The power law used in scale - free models to characterize the degree - distribution is clearly an approximation , as no vertex can have a degree greater as the number of vertices . That is not a problem as the probability to have such a degree is extremely low when there are thousands of vertices . However , as we will need such a distribution to define the probability of occurence for an edge and to ensure analytic correctness , we introduce the following probability law : Definition 1 . Let ( α , m ) ∈ R × N ∗ . An integer random variable X follows a truncated power law of parameters α and m if P ( X ( ω ) = k ) =   C α ( m ) k α if 1 ≤ k ≤ m 0 else where C α ( m ) is a normalisation factor ( C α ( m ) = ( (cid:80) mk = 1 1 k α ) − 1 ) . For α > 1 , C α ( m ) has a finite limit denoted by C α ( note that C α = ζ − 1 ( α ) ) . For α > 2 , we define λ α = C α C α − 1 2 . 2 . The bipartite model Let n and m be two fixed integers and α > 0 . The random bipartite graph model of parameters n , m and α consists on sampling a bipartite graph H ( ω ) = ( ⊥ , (cid:62) , E ( ω ) ) using the following steps ( i ) – ( iii ) . The fact that H is sampled under that model will be denoted by H ∈ BG n , m , α . ( i ) Take two sets ⊥ and (cid:62) of vertices , of respective size n and m . We denote the vertices of ⊥ by v 1 , . . . , v n and the vertices of (cid:62) by w 1 , . . . , w m . ( ii ) For each 1 ≤ i ≤ n , an ( m + 1 ) - tupel ( p i ( ω ) , ( r ij ( ω ) ) 1 ≤ j ≤ m ) ∈ N × [ 0 , 1 ] m of independent variables is sampled . The variables p i and r ij follow respectively the truncated power law of parameters α and m and the uniform law on [ 0 , 1 ] . Moreover , the n ( m + 1 ) - tupels are independent . ( iii ) The edge set E ( ω ) is then the set of pairs ( v i , w j ) such that r ij ( ω ) < p i ( ω ) m . As p i is drawn from a truncated power law with parameters α and m , we have 0 ≤ p i m ≤ 1 . Then , intuitively , the former steps correspond to : ( a ) choose an ‘a - priori’ degree p i for each v i ∈ ⊥ , drawn from a truncated power law . ( b ) put an edge between vertices v i and w j with probability p i m , the presence of the edges being independent conditionally to the p i ’s . The degree of v i knowing p i then follows a binomial law of parameters m and p i : The mean degree of v i is therefore the former chosen ‘a - priori’ degree . 2270 E .

Only the biggest component of G ( 69 vertices ) is represented . The drawing was done using the PAJEK software ( http : / / vlado . fmf . uni - lj . si / pub / networks / pajek / ) . 2 . 3 . The scale - free model The scale free random model of parameters n , m and α consists on sampling a graph G ( ω ) = ( V , E ( ω ) ) using the following steps : ( i ) Sample a graph H ∈ BG n , m , α . ( ii ) Let G be the ⊥ - projection of H . The fact that G is sampled under that model will be denoted by G ∈ SF G n , m , α . Fig . 2 shows the biggest connected component of a network sampled under SF G 100 , 100 , 2 . 2 . The model is defined for every n , m and α > 1 . However , in order to simplify the analytic study of the properties of the obtained graphs , we will make the following assumptions , which correspond to biological observations [ 14 , 24 ] , for the rest of the paper : • 2 < α < 3 • n and m are of the same order of magnitude . We will even explicit the results for n = m when they tend to infinity but it is easy to show that the general trends remain for c 1 m ≤ n ≤ c 2 m , c 1 , c 2 ∈ R . 3 . Degree distributions 3 . 1 . Degree distributions in the bipartite model Before studying the scale - free model degree distribution , let us study the bipartite models’ one . 3 . 1 . 1 . The top degree distribution As the ( m + 1 ) - tupels ( p i ( ω ) , ( r ij ( ω ) ) 1 ≤ j ≤ m ) are independent , it is straightforward to see that the degree distribution of the top vertices follows a binomial law of parameters n and p (cid:62) , where p (cid:62) is the probability for two vertices v ∈ ⊥ and w ∈ (cid:62) to be adjacent , that is : p (cid:62) = m (cid:88) p = 1 p m C α ( m ) p α = C α ( m ) mC α − 1 ( m ) ≈ λ α m . As m scales like n , p (cid:62) scales like λ α n and therefore the binomial law can be approximated by a Poisson law of parameter λ α . E . Birmelé / Discrete Applied Mathematics 157 ( 2009 ) 2267 – 2284 2271 3 . 1 . 2 . The bottom degree distribution In order to abbreviate future equations , we denote by h α the function defined by h α ( m , k ) = P ( d H ( v i ) = k ) for H ∈ BG n , m , α , v i ∈ ⊥ . Using the fact that , knowing p i , d H ( v i ) follows a binomial law of parameters m and p i , h α ( m , k ) = m (cid:88) p = 1 P ( d H ( v i ) = k | p i = p ) P ( p i = p ) = m (cid:88) p = 1 (cid:16) m k (cid:17) (cid:16) p m (cid:17) k (cid:16) 1 − p m (cid:17) m − k C α ( m ) p α . Let us define , for every positive integer k , H α ( k ) = lim m →∞ h α ( m , k ) . Then Theorem 2 . ∀ 2 < α < 3 , ∀ k ≥ 0 , • H α ( k ) exists and H α ( k ) = C α k ! + ∞ (cid:88) p = 1 p k − α e − p • H α ( k ) ∼ k → + ∞ C α k α . That result proves that for big enough m , the law of the degrees of the bottom - vertices can be approximated by a power - law , which was one of the requirements for the model . The proof has three main steps : we find the exact expression of H α , prove that H α ( k ) is similar to C α Γ ( k − α + 1 ) k ! and finally prove that the former expression is similar to C α 1 k α . It is detailed in the Appendix . 3 . 2 . Degree distribution in the scale - free model In that section , we prove that the graphs in SF G n , m , α , obtained by projection of the bipartite ones , are scale - free . Let us denote by g α the function defined by g α ( m , k ) = P ( d G ( v ) = k ) for G ∈ SF G n , m , α , v ∈ V ( G ) g α ( m , k ) = (cid:88) { w 1 , . . . , w j } ⊂(cid:62) P ( d G ( v ) = k | N H ( v ) = { w 1 , . . . , w j } ) P ( N H ( v ) = { w 1 , . . . , w j } ) . ( 1 ) Let f α be a function defined by f α ( m , j ) = m (cid:88) p = 1 (cid:16) 1 − p m (cid:17) j C α ( m ) p α . For a given set { w 1 , . . . , w j } ⊂ (cid:62) and a vertex v (cid:48) ∈ ⊥ , P ( N H ( v (cid:48) ) ∩ { w 1 , . . . , w j } = ∅ ) = m (cid:88) p = 1 P ( N H ( v (cid:48) ) ∩ { w 1 , . . . , w j } = ∅ | p ( v (cid:48) ) = p ) P ( p ( v (cid:48) ) = p ) = q (cid:88) p = 1 (cid:16) 1 − p m (cid:17) j C α ( m ) p α = f α ( m , j ) and P ( N H ( v (cid:48) ) ∩ { w 1 , . . . , w j } (cid:54) = ∅ ) = 1 − f α ( m , j ) . Thus P ( d G ( v ) = k | N H ( v ) = { w 1 , . . . , w j } ) = (cid:18) n − 1 k (cid:19) ( 1 − f α ( m , j ) ) k f α ( m , j ) n − 1 − k . ( 2 ) 2272 E .

Using Eq . ( 2 ) and the definition of h α ( m , j ) in Eq . ( 1 ) , we obtain g α ( m , k ) = m (cid:88) j = 0 (cid:18) n − 1 k (cid:19) ( f α ( m , j ) ) n − 1 − k ( 1 − f α ( m , j ) ) k h α ( m , j ) . ( 3 ) Let us define , for every positive integer k , G α ( k ) = lim m →∞ g α ( m , k ) . Then , using Eq . ( 3 ) and Theorem 2 , one can show the following result : Theorem 3 . ∀ 2 < α < 3 , ∀ k ≥ 1 , • G α ( k ) exists and G α ( k ) = 1 k ! + ∞ (cid:88) j = 0 e − λ α j ( λ α j ) k H α ( j ) • G α ( k ) ∼ k → + ∞ C α λ α − 1 α k α . That result shows that the graphs in SF G n , m , α are scale - free if they are big enough . Fig . 3 illustrates that phenomenon . The proof is very similar to the one of Theorem 2 and is also detailed in the Appendix . 4 . Preferential attachment and tree - likeness 4 . 1 . Preferential attachment Let u , v , w be three bottom - vertices . We denote by I u v , u , v ∈ ⊥ , the random indicator of edge u v , that is the random variable with value 1 if u v ∈ E ( G ) and value 0 if not . Lemma 4 . ∀ ( u , v ) ∈ ⊥ 2 , P ( u v ∈ E ( G ) ) = E ( I u v ) ∼ m →∞ λ 2 α m . ( 4 ) Moreover , ∀ ( u , v , w ) ∈ ⊥ 3 , P ( u v ∈ E ( G ) and u w ∈ E ( G ) ) = E ( I u v I u w ) = O (cid:18) 1 m α − 1 (cid:19) . ( 5 ) Those results emphasize the preferential attachment phenomenon as the probability of u and w to be neighbours becomes greater if we already know that u has another neighbour v . E . Birmelé / Discrete Applied Mathematics 157 ( 2009 ) 2267 – 2284 2273 Proof . u and v are not neighbours in G if and only if they have no common neighbour in H . Therefore , knowing the ‘a - priori’ degrees p u and p v of u and v , it occurs with probability (cid:16) 1 − p u p v m 2 (cid:17) m . Thus , m P ( u v ∈ E ( G ) ) = m (cid:88) p u , p v = 1 m (cid:16) 1 − (cid:16) 1 − p u p v m 2 (cid:17) m (cid:17) C α ( m ) p α u v C α ( m ) p αv . ( 6 ) As m (cid:16) 1 − (cid:16) 1 − p u p v m 2 (cid:17) m (cid:17) tends to p u p v being lower than it and (cid:80) mp u , p v = 1 C α ( m ) p α − 1 u C α ( m ) p α − 1 v has a finite limit , we can deduce from Eq . ( 6 ) that lim m → + ∞ m P ( u v ∈ E ( G ) ) = lim m → + ∞ m (cid:88) p u , p v = 1 C α ( m ) p α − 1 u C α ( m ) p α − 1 v = λ 2 α . The proof of the second part of the lemma is more technical and is developped in the Appendix . (cid:3) 4 . 2 . Tree - likeness Let us now show that the graphs drawn under SF G n , m , α are tree - like , that is their number e ( G ) grows linearly with their number n of vertices . As e ( G ) = (cid:80) u , v ∈⊥ I u v , we obtain , using the linearity of the mean and Relation ( 4 ) , E ( e ( G ) ) = (cid:88) u , v ∈⊥ E ( I u v ) ∼ n →∞ λ 2 α 2 n . Moreover , expanding ( e ( G ) 2 ) and using both Relations ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) , there exists a scalar K such that E ( ( e ( G ) ) 2 ) = (cid:88) u , v ∈⊥ E ( I u v ) + (cid:88) u , v , w ∈⊥ E ( I u v I u w ) ≤ Kn 4 − α . As 4 − α < 2 , we can choose (cid:15) < 2 − α 2 and apply Chebyshev’s Inequality : P (cid:18) | e ( G ) − E ( e ( G ) ) | > E ( e ( G ) ) n (cid:15) (cid:19) ≤ n 2 (cid:15) Var ( e ( G ) ) E ( e ( G ) ) 2 ∼ n →∞ 4 K λ 4 α n 2 − α + 2 (cid:15) . That probability then tends to zero , that is e ( G ) concentrates around its mean , which is linear in n . The graphs of SF G n , m , α are thus tree - like . 5 . The giant component and the small - world property The global connectivity of biological networks has two main characteristics : most of the nodes belong to a same connected component and the diameter of this component is small , that is there exist a short path joining every two of them . Those characteristics were shown for metabolic networks [ 14 , 22 ] , protein interaction networks [ 24 ] or regulatory networks [ 9 ] . Both properties are well - studied in the Erdős – Rényi model [ 4 ] and we can use the known results because of the following observation : Let us consider the (cid:62) - projection H (cid:62) of H : V ( H (cid:62) ) = (cid:62) and ( v 1 , v 2 ) ∈ E ( H (cid:62) ) if v 1 and v 2 have a common neighbour in ⊥ . Conditionally to the p i ’s , H (cid:62) is an Erdős – Rényi graph with parameter ρ = 1 − m (cid:89) i = 1 (cid:18) 1 − p 2 i m 2 (cid:19) that is , each pair of vertices is an edge with probability ρ , independently from the other pairs . Moreover , the parameter ρ of this Erdős – Rényi random graph is strictly greater than 1 m with probability tending to one : Lemma 5 . ∃ K , β , η > 0 such that , for big enough m , P (cid:18) ρ < 1 + η m (cid:19) ≤ K e − β m . The proof , essentially based on Taylor expansions , is given in the Appendix . 2274 E . Birmelé / Discrete Applied Mathematics 157 ( 2009 ) 2267 – 2284 ( a ) Size of the component containing v 1 . ( b ) Maximal distance to v 1 in its component . Fig . 4 . Size the connected component containing v 1 and maximal distance to v 1 in that component for 144 graphs drawn under SF G 100 , 100 , 2 . 2 . These graphs were obtained by simulating 200 graphs and deleting the 56 for which v 1 was an isolated vertex . 5 . 1 . The giant component Graphs drawn under SF G n , m , α have a unique component of size O ( n ) , namely : Theorem 6 . There exists a scalar κ ( α ) such that , for G ∈ SF G n , m , α , lim m , n →∞ P ( G has a connected component of size at least κ n ) = 1 and this component is the unique one growing linearly with n . No lower bound is given for κ but , running simulations , it seems that , in most of the cases , between a half and three quarters of the vertices belong to the big component : Fig . 4 ( a ) shows the size of the component containing v 1 for 144 random graphs drawn under SF G 100 , 100 , 2 . 2 . In fact , 200 graphs were generated and the 56 in which v 1 was isolated were deleted . This ratio of isolated vertices is not surprising as the ratio of isolated bottom - vertices in H is ( 1 − 1 m ) m which tends to 1 e when m tends to infinity . Proof . It is known [ 4 , 19 ] that almost every Erdős – Rényi random graph on n vertices with parameter p > 1 n has one unique component of size O ( n ) and that the second biggest one is of size O ( log ( n ) ) . Applying that result to H (cid:62) and denoting by W (cid:62) the giant component of H (cid:62) , there exists a constant term κ such that lim m →∞ P (cid:18) | W (cid:62) | ≥ 3 κ m | ρ ≥ 1 + η m (cid:19) = 1 . As P ( | W (cid:62) | ≤ 3 κ m ) ≤ P (cid:18) | W (cid:62) | ≤ 3 κ m | ρ ≥ 1 + η m (cid:19) + P (cid:18) ρ < 1 + η m (cid:19) we obtain lim m →∞ P ( | W (cid:62) | ≥ 3 κ m ) = 1 . ( 7 ) Let W ⊥ be the set of bottom vertices seeing at least one vertex of W (cid:62) . Then W ⊥ forms a connected component of G and , knowing that | W (cid:62) | ≥ 3 κ m , we have , for any v ∈ ⊥ and large enough m P ( v has a neighbour in W (cid:62) ) ≥ 1 − f α ( 3 κ m ) ≥ 1 − (cid:18) 1 − 1 m (cid:19) 3 κ m ≥ 1 − e − 2 κ ≥ 2 κ . Therefore , P ( | W ⊥ | ≤ κ n | | W (cid:62) | ≥ 3 κ m ) ≤ P ( X ≤ κ n ) where X follows an binomial law B ( n , 2 κ ) . Using Chernoff’s bound [ 5 ] , we obtain P ( | W ⊥ | ≤ κ n | | W (cid:62) | ≥ 3 κ m ) ≤ P ( | X − 2 κ n | > κ n ) ≤ 2e − 2 κ 2 n . E . Birmelé / Discrete Applied Mathematics 157 ( 2009 ) 2267 – 2284 2275 Finally , P ( | W ⊥ | ≤ κ n ) ≤ P ( | W ⊥ | ≤ κ n | | W (cid:62) | ≥ 3 κ m ) + P ( | W (cid:62) | ≤ 3 κ m ) and both parts of the second member tend to zero when n tends to infinity . (cid:3) 5 . 2 . The diameter Chung and Lu [ 7 ] have shown that , in almost every Erdős – Rényi random graph on n vertices with parameter p > cn , c > 1 , the diameter of the giant component is of size O ( log ( n ) ) . Knowing that ρ > 1 + η n , the diameter of the subgraph of H (cid:62) induced by W (cid:62) is then of size O ( log ( n ) ) . Therefore , as the diameter of the subgraph of G induced by W ⊥ is at most the former plus one , it is also of size O ( log ( n ) ) . As P ( ρ > 1 + η n ) tends to one , almost every graph drawn under SF G n , m , α shows the small - world property . Fig . 4 ( b ) represents the maximal distance to v 1 in its connected component for 144 random graphs generated under SF G 100 , 100 , 2 . 2 . 6 . The clustering coefficient The local connectivity of real networks is characterized by a strong trend to form clusters , that is the neighbourhood of the nodes are highly connected . The mathematical tool to measure that trend is the clustering coefficient of the network [ 23 ] , which is defined as follows : • for each vertex v , define the local clustering coefficient c ( v ) by c ( v ) = number of triangles connected to vertex v number of paths of length two centered in v . For vertices of degree 0 and 1 , for which both numerator and denominator are zero , define c ( v ) = 0 . • the clustering coefficient C ( G ) of the network is the average local clustering coefficient : C ( G ) = 1 n (cid:88) v ∈ V c ( v ) . That coefficient is also called the transitivity of the network , as it shows the tendency of two neighbours of a given vertex to be also neighbours . Its value tends to be considerably higher in real networks than in random graphs . Indeed , it tends to a non - zero limit when the network becomes large , whereas the clustering coefficient of Erdős – Rényi graphs tends to zero when n tends to infinity . We will prove in this section that our model satisfies that local connectivity constraint , namely : Theorem 7 . Almost every graph drawn under the SF G n , m , α model has an high clustering coefficient , that is : lim n →∞ P (cid:18) C ( G ) ≤ e − 2 2 e 2 (cid:19) = 0 . Proof . The proof of this theorem is based on Chebyshev’s inequality . To apply it , we need two preliminary steps : we prove that the expected value of C ( G ) does not tend to 0 whereas its variance does . Let v ∈ ⊥ and w ∈ (cid:62) be such that w is the unique neighbour of v in (cid:62) and w has at least two other neighbours in ⊥ . Then , in G , c ( v ) = 1 . Therefore : E ( c ( v ) ) ≥ P ( N H ( v ) = { w } ) P ( | N H ( w ) \ { v } | ≥ 2 ) . The first probability tends to H α ( 1 ) and the second tends to 1 − ( 1 + λ α ) e − λ α . Those values are respectively strictly greater than 1 e and ( 1 − 2 e ) . Thus , for big enough n , E ( c ( v ) ) ≥ e − 2 e 2 . ( 8 ) Therefore , as the former inequality is true for every bottom vertex , E ( C ( G ) ) ≥ e − 2 e 2 . ( 9 ) 2276 E . Birmelé / Discrete Applied Mathematics 157 ( 2009 ) 2267 – 2284 Moreover , for any vertices u , v ∈ ⊥ , 0 ≤ c ( u ) ≤ 1 and c ( u ) and c ( v ) are independent conditionally to the fact that u and v have no common neighbour . Thus : E ( c ( u ) c ( v ) ) = (cid:88) A , B ⊂(cid:62) E (cid:0) c ( u ) I N ( u ) = A c ( v ) I N ( v ) = B (cid:1) ≤ (cid:88) A ∩ B = ∅ E (cid:0) c ( u ) I N ( u ) = A c ( v ) I N ( v ) = B (cid:1) + P ( u v ∈ E ( G ) ) ≤ (cid:88) A ∩ B = ∅ E (cid:0) c ( u ) I N ( u ) = A (cid:1) E (cid:0) c ( v ) I N ( v ) = B (cid:1) + P ( u v ∈ E ( G ) ) ≤ E ( c ( u ) ) E ( c ( v ) ) + P ( u v ∈ E ( G ) ) . By Lemma 4 , it exists K > 0 such that E ( c ( u ) c ( v ) ) − E ( c ( u ) ) E ( c ( v ) ) ≤ K m . ( 10 ) As E   (cid:32)(cid:88) u ∈⊥ c ( u ) (cid:33) 2   = (cid:88) u ∈⊥ E (cid:0) ( c ( u ) ) 2 (cid:1) + 2 (cid:88) u , v ∈⊥ E ( c ( u ) c ( v ) ) and E (cid:32)(cid:88) u ∈⊥ c ( u ) (cid:33) 2 = (cid:88) u ∈⊥ E ( c ( u ) ) 2 + 2 (cid:88) u , v ∈⊥ E ( c ( u ) ) E ( c ( v ) ) we obtain Var (cid:32) 1 n (cid:88) u ∈⊥ c ( u ) (cid:33) = 1 n 2 (cid:88) u ∈⊥ Var ( c ( u ) ) + 2 n 2 (cid:88) u , v ∈⊥ ( E ( c ( u ) c ( v ) ) − E ( c ( u ) ) E ( c ( v ) ) ) . Using the fact that Var ( c ( u ) ) ≤ 1 as 0 ≤ c ( u ) ≤ 1 and Inequality ( 10 ) , Var ( C ( G ) ) ≤ 1 n + K m . ( 11 ) We can now apply Chebyshev’s inequality together with inequalities ( 9 ) and ( 11 ) : for n large enough , P (cid:18) C ( G ) ≤ e − 2 2 e 2 (cid:19) ≤ P (cid:18) | C ( G ) − E ( C ( G ) ) | ≥ e − 2 2 e 2 (cid:19) ≤ 4 e 4 ( e − 2 ) 2 Var ( C ( G ) ) ≤ 4 e 4 ( e − 2 ) 2 (cid:18) 1 n + 2 λ 2 α m (cid:19) . (cid:3) Remark 8 . The lower bound for the clustering coefficient given by Theorem 7 may be far from best as we disregarded all vertices for which the local coefficient was non - zero but strictly lower than one . 7 . Directed graphs Our model can easily be extended to directed graphs , becoming dependant on two parameters α in and α out . The bipartite graph is drawn in two steps : ( i ) generate the edges going from ⊥ to (cid:62) following the undirected procedure with parameter α out . ( ii ) generate the edges going from (cid:62) to ⊥ following the same procedure with parameter α in . The bottom vertices of the obtained graph then show scale - free in - degree and out - degree distributions with respective parameters α in and α out . We define the ⊥ - projection G of a directed bipartite graph H = ( ⊥ , (cid:62) , (cid:69) E ) as the directed graph with V ( G ) = ⊥ and (cid:69) u v ∈ (cid:69) E ( G ) if there exists w ∈ (cid:62) such that u → w → v is a path of length two in H . E . Birmelé / Discrete Applied Mathematics 157 ( 2009 ) 2267 – 2284 2277 Using the same decomposition that in Section 3 , it is then straightforward to prove the following : P ( d inG ( u ) = k ) = m (cid:88) j = 0 (cid:18) n − 1 k (cid:19) (cid:0) f α out ( m , j ) (cid:1) n − 1 − k (cid:0) 1 − f α out ( m , j ) (cid:1) k h α in ( m , j ) P ( d outG ( u ) = k ) = m (cid:88) j = 0 (cid:18) n − 1 k (cid:19) (cid:0) f α in ( m , j ) (cid:1) n − 1 − k (cid:0) 1 − f α in ( m , j ) (cid:1) k h α out ( m , j ) . The proof of Theorem 3 can also be rewritten and we obtain , Theorem 9 . ∀ 2 < α in < 3 , ∀ 2 < α out < 3 , ∀ k ≥ 0 , • G in α in , α out ( k ) = lim m →∞ P ( d inG ( u ) = k ) exists and G in α in , α out ( k ) ∼ k → + ∞ C α in λ α in − 1 α out k α in • G out α in , α out ( k ) = lim m →∞ P ( d outG ( u ) = k ) exists and G out α in , α out ( k ) ∼ k → + ∞ C α out λ α out − 1 α in k α out . That theorem shows that both in - degree and out - degree distributions are scale - free and of respective parameters α in and α out . 8 . Conclusion Somerealnetworks , inparticularmetabolicones , showanunderlyingbipartitestructure , whichcanbeusedasapowerful tool to model them . We presented a random graph model based on that structure , that is which generates random bipartite graphs and then takes their projection . That model depends on only three parameters , or four if the generated graph are directed , is time - invariant and respects the main global features of biological networks . In particular , the obtained random graphs are scale - free . The next step will be to determine the law of the motif counts in such a model in order to be able to generate p - values for the motifs of interest without simulations .

Proofs A . 1 . Proof of Theorem 2 The proofs of both Theorems 2 and 3 follow a common scheme : we first give an exact expression for H α and G α and then approximate it using the Γ function . Before doing that in the bipartite case , let us show a technical result , which will be useful several times in the following proofs : Lemma 10 . Let a , b > 0 .

Using Stirling’s formula , we obtain ( k − b ) k − b e − ( k − b ) + 1 k ! = ( k − b ) k − b e − ( k − b ) √ 2 π k k k e − k ( 1 + O ( 1 ) ) = 1 √ 2 π k b + 1 / 2 e b (cid:18) 1 − b k (cid:19) k − b ( 1 + O ( 1 ) ) = O (cid:18) 1 k b + 1 / 2 (cid:19) as lim k → + ∞ (cid:0) 1 − bk (cid:1) k − b = e − b . (cid:3) Lemma 11 . H α ( k ) = C α k ! + ∞ (cid:88) p = 1 p k − α e − p . Proof . Let us define , for every integers m and p , φ m ( p ) =   p k − α (cid:16) 1 − p m (cid:17) m − k if p ≤ m 0 if p > m . Then , for every m , + ∞ (cid:88) p = 1 p k − α (cid:16) 1 − p m (cid:17) m − k = + ∞ (cid:88) p = 1 φ m ( p ) . Moreover , • lim m →∞ φ m ( p ) = p k − α e − p • ∀ p , φ m ( p ) ≤ p k − α e − p / 2 for m > 2 k • (cid:80) + ∞ p = 1 p k − α e − p / 2 is finite . Therefore , lim m →∞ + ∞ (cid:88) p = 1 p k − α (cid:16) 1 − p m (cid:17) m − k = + ∞ (cid:88) p = 1 p k − α e − p . As lim m →∞ C α ( m ) = C α and lim m →∞ (cid:0) mk (cid:1) 1 m k = 1 k ! , we obtain the lemma . (cid:3) Lemma 12 . H α ( k ) = C α k α + O (cid:18) 1 k α + 1 / 2 (cid:19) . Proof . (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) H α ( k ) − C α k α (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) H α ( k ) − Γ ( k − α + 1 ) k !

( A . 1 ) Applying Lemma 10 for a = 1 and b = α tells us that (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) H α ( k ) − Γ ( k − α + 1 ) k ! (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) = O (cid:18) 1 k α + 1 / 2 (cid:19) . ( A . 2 ) To deal with the second term , let us recall Stirling’s formula , giving the Taylor expansion of ln ( Γ ) : ln Γ ( z ) = (cid:18) z − 1 2 (cid:19) ln ( z ) − z + ln ( 2 π ) 2 + 1 12 z + O (cid:18) 1 z 2 (cid:19) . E . Birmelé / Discrete Applied Mathematics 157 ( 2009 ) 2267 – 2284 2279 Using that formula , we have ln (cid:18) Γ ( k − α + 1 ) k ! (cid:19) = (cid:18) k − α + 1 2 (cid:19) ln ( k − α + 1 ) − k + α − 1 + ln ( 2 π ) 2 + 1 12 ( k − α + 1 ) − k ln ( k ) + k − 1 2 ln ( k ) − ln ( 2 π ) 2 − 1 12 k + O (cid:18) 1 k 2 (cid:19) = − α ln ( k ) + k (cid:18) − α − 1 k − ( α − 1 ) 2 k 2 (cid:19) − (cid:18) α − 1 2 (cid:19) (cid:18) − α − 1 k (cid:19) + α − 1 + O (cid:18) 1 k 2 (cid:19) = − α ln ( k ) + α ( α − 1 ) 2 k + O (cid:18) 1 k 2 (cid:19) . Therefore Γ ( k − α + 1 ) k ! = exp (cid:18) − α ln ( k ) + α ( α − 1 ) 2 k + O (cid:18) 1 k 2 (cid:19)(cid:19) = 1 k α exp (cid:18) α ( α − 1 ) 2 k + O (cid:18) 1 k 2 (cid:19)(cid:19) = 1 k α (cid:18) 1 + α ( α − 1 ) 2 k + O (cid:18) 1 k 2 (cid:19)(cid:19) . Finally , (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) Γ ( k − α + 1 ) k ! − 1 k α (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) = O (cid:18) 1 k α + 1 (cid:19) . ( A . 3 ) Reporting Eqs . ( A . 2 ) and ( A . 3 ) in Eq . ( A . 1 ) implies the lemma . (cid:3) Theorem 2 is now an easy consequence of Lemma 12 . A . 2 . Proof of Theorem 3 The proof uses the same technique as the former one but is a bit more technical , as we first need to approximate f α ( m , j ) : Lemma 13 . f α ( m , j ) = 1 − λ α j m + O (cid:18) 1 m α − 1 (cid:19) . Proof . f α ( m , j ) = m (cid:88) p = 1 (cid:16) 1 − p m (cid:17) j C α ( m ) p α = C α ( m ) m (cid:88) p = 1 j (cid:88) l = 0 (cid:18) j l (cid:19) ( − 1 ) l p l − α m l = C α ( m ) j (cid:88) l = 0 m (cid:88) p = 1 (cid:18) j l (cid:19) ( − 1 ) l p l − α m l = 1 − λ α j m + C α ( m ) j (cid:88) l = 2 (cid:18) j l (cid:19) ( − 1 ) l m (cid:88) p = 1 p l − α m l . 2280 E .

G α ( k ) = 1 k ! + ∞ (cid:88) j = 0 e − λ α j ( λ α j ) k H α ( j ) . Proof . Let us define , for every integers m and j , φ m ( j ) =   (cid:18) m − 1 k (cid:19) f α ( m , j ) m − 1 − k ( 1 − f α ( m , j ) ) k h α ( m , j ) if j ≤ m 0 if j > m . Then , for every m , g α ( m , k ) = + ∞ (cid:88) j = 0 φ m ( j ) .

Proof of Lemma 5 We give here the proof of Lemma 5 . Lemma 16 . ∃ K , β , η > 0 such that , for big enough m , P (cid:18) ρ < 1 + η m (cid:19) ≤ K e − β m . Proof . Let m 0 ∈ N be such that C α ( m 0 ) < 1 . Such an integer exists as 2 < α < 3 . Let k 0 ∈ N and β > 0besuchthat β = − ln ( k 0 ) + k 0 − 1 k 0 ln ( k 0 − 1 ) − ( 1 − 1 k 0 ) ln ( C α ( m 0 ) ) . Theyexistas − ln ( k ) + k − 1 k ln ( k − 1 ) tends to zero when k tends to infinity and C α ( m 0 ) < 1 . Let η = (cid:16) 1 + 1 k 0 (cid:17) 2 − 1 . ρ < 1 + η m ⇐⇒ 1 − m (cid:89) i = 1 (cid:18) 1 − p 2 i m 2 (cid:19) < 1 + η m ⇐⇒ m (cid:88) i = 1 ln (cid:18) 1 − p 2 i m 2 (cid:19) < ln (cid:18) 1 − 1 + η m (cid:19) . As ln (cid:16) 1 − p 2 i m 2 (cid:17) > −√ 1 + η p 2 i m 2 for large enough m and ln (cid:16) 1 − 1 + η m (cid:17) < − 1 + η m , P (cid:18) ρ < 1 + η m (cid:19) ≤ P (cid:32) − m (cid:88) i = 1 p 2 i m 2 ≥ − √ 1 + η m (cid:33) . Moreover , (cid:40)(cid:32) − m (cid:88) i = 1 p 2 i m 2 ≥ − √ 1 + η m (cid:33)(cid:41) = (cid:40) m (cid:88) i = 1 p 2 i ≤ (cid:112) 1 + η m (cid:41) = (cid:40) m (cid:88) i = 1 p 2 i ≤ (cid:18) 1 + 1 k 0 (cid:19) m (cid:41) ⊂ (cid:26) At least (cid:18) 1 − 1 k 0 (cid:19) m of the p i ’s are equal to 1 (cid:27) . Therefore , for m > m 0 , P (cid:18) ρ < 1 + η m (cid:19) ≤ P (cid:18) At least (cid:18) 1 − 1 k 0 (cid:19) m of the p i ’s are equal to 1 (cid:19) ≤ (cid:32) m mk 0 (cid:33) C α ( m ) ( 1 − 1 / k 0 ) m ≤ K k m 0 ( k 0 − 1 ) m ( k 0 − 1 ) / k 0 C α ( m 0 ) ( 1 − 1 / k 0 ) m ≤ K e (cid:16) ln ( k 0 ) − k 0 − 1 k 0 ln ( k 0 − 1 ) + (cid:16) 1 − 1 k 0 (cid:17) ln ( C α ( m 0 ) ) (cid:17) m ≤ K e − β m (cid:3) References [ 1 ] W .
