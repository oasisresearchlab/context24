Positive feedback between auxin signalling and 32 transport is a key prerequisite for self - organizing development including flexible vascular tissue 33 formation and directional growth responses , such as gravitropism . Here we identified a mechanistic link 34 between cell surface ABP1 - based auxin perception , the associated TMK1 kinase and PIN auxin 35 transporters . abp1 and tmk1 mutants are defective in auxin - triggered phosphorylation of PIN proteins 36 and in PIN - mediated directional auxin transport . Auxin , via ABP1 , induces activation and stabilization 37 of TMK1 , thus promoting direct interaction with and phosphorylation of PIN2 . Following 38 gravistimulation , the auxin - activated TMK1 acts along the lower root side to reinforce asymmetry in 39 PIN2 - mediated auxin fluxes for gravitropic root bending . This ABP1 - TMK1 - dependent positive 40 feedback on PIN - mediated directional auxin transport is fundamental for robust root gravitropism and 41 presumably also for other self - organizing developmental processes . 42 43 44 KEY WORDS 45 Auxin , auxin transport , auxin canalization , ABP1 , TMK1 , protein phosphorylation , root gravitropism 46 47 INTRODUCTION 48 Being sedentary , plants utilize directional growth to spread and position themselves in various 49 environments . Such plant ‘movements’ according to gravity , light , water availability and other factors 50 are a crucial part of their survival strategy 1 . Other spectacular examples of the superior adaptability of 51 plant development are self - organizing processes such as the formation of an embryonal axis , the regular 52 arrangement of leaves and flowers , the formation of intricate leaf vein patterns , and flexible regeneration 53 of vasculature around a wound . The phytohormone auxin serves as the major endogenous signal behind 54 all this impressive adaptive development 2 . It translates environmental stimuli such as light and gravity 55 into growth responses and aids self - organizing development on account of a feedback regulation 56 between auxin signalling and polar auxin flow 3 , 4 , 5 . 57 Directional cell - to - cell auxin transport is a unique , plant - specific mechanism 6 that relies on several 58 plasma membrane - localized transporters 7 , 8 . Chief among these are the AUX1 / LAX auxin importers 9 and 59 the PIN auxin exporters , with the latter determining auxin flow direction by their polarized subcellular 60 localization 10 , 11 . Inside the cell , auxin triggers a well - studied , predominantly nuclear signalling pathway 61 dependent on TIR1 / AFB auxin receptors leading to developmental reprogramming 12 , 13 and growth 62 regulation 14 . The less well characterized , cell surface auxin signalling involves the AUXIN BINDING 63 PROTEIN 1 ( ABP1 ) receptor and the leucine - rich repeat receptor - like kinase ( LRR RLK ) 64 TRANSMEMBRANE RECEPTOR - LIKE KINASEs ( TMKs ) 15 , 16 . Both these signalling mechanisms 65 are required for auxin feedback on PIN - mediated auxin transport as manifested during the so - called 66 ‘auxin canalization’ , the formation of polarized auxin - transporting channels from a local auxin 67 source 15 , 17 . Auxin canalization is a process relying on a positive feedback between auxin signalling and 68 auxin transport 3 . This is consistent with theoretical models of auxin feedback - based PIN polarization 69 encompassing both intracellular and cell surface auxin signalling 18 . It has been speculated that auxin 70 impacts PIN activity and polarity by affecting endocytic trafficking 19 involving clathrin - mediated PIN 71 endocytosis 20 and ARF - GEF GNOM - dependent PIN endosomal recycling 21 , 22 as well as post - 72 translational modifications , chiefly reversible phosphorylation 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 . Nonetheless , the mechanistic 73 link between auxin signalling and PIN - mediated transport has remained elusive . 74 Fast root gravitropism , mediated by directional auxin flow from the site of gravity perception at the root 75 cap towards the elongation zone where the growth response takes place , is among the latest evolutionary 76 innovations in the quest of plants to grow upright 27 . Besides being a fascinating example of adaptive 77 plant development 28 , it is also a perfect model for studying the coordination of auxin signalling and 78 transport . After gravity sensing by sedimenting statoliths in root cap cells 29 , the auxin flux is redirected 79 towards the lower side of the root by PIN polarization to bottom cell sides 30 , 31 . This initial auxin 80 asymmetry is propagated from the root tip to the elongation zone by AUX1 - and PIN2 - mediated 81 transport 32 , 33 , 27 , and translated into growth redirection through inhibition of cell elongation at the lower 82 root side 34 . During this response , PIN2 distribution also becomes asymmetric with PIN2 being more 83 abundant at the lower side of the root as compared to the upper side 35 , 36 . Such asymmetric PIN2 84 distribution thus not only propagates , but also reinforces the initial auxin gradient at the root tip , crucially 85 contributing to the robustness of the root bending response as well as to the fine - tuning of gravitropism 86 by other hormonal cues 37 . Nonetheless , the underlying mechanism of this auxin flow reinforcement 87 remains unclear . 88 Here we uncovered a role of the ABP1 - TMK1 cell surface auxin signalling in direct phosphorylation 89 and regulation of PIN auxin transporters . In the context of gravitropic root bending , TMK1 interacts in 90 an auxin - dependent manner with PIN2 and phosphorylates it . This provides a direct mechanism for 91 feedback regulation of auxin transport , applicable not only to gravitropism but also to other 92 developmental processes . 93 94 RESULTS 95 96 ABP1 - TMK1 auxin perception mediates auxin - triggered PIN phosphorylation 97 ABP1 - TMK - mediated cell surface auxin signalling was recently implicated in self - organizing aspects 98 of plant development such as vasculature regeneration and de novo establishment of auxin - transporting 99 channels 15 . These phenomena are encompassed by the broader term ‘auxin canalization’ and are 100 postulated to rely on a direct feedback between auxin signalling and auxin transport 4 . The molecular 101 insights into canalization remained largely enigmatic until the recent identification of CAMEL and 102 CANAR , two LRR RLKs , which target PIN auxin efflux carriers ( PINs ) to polarize cells for auxin 103 transport across tissues 38 . 104 Motivated by this possible link between phospho - signalling and canalization , we decided to investigate 105 whether auxin perception by ABP1 - TMKs might itself feed into PIN - mediated polar auxin transport . 106 We took advantage of a published rapid phospho - proteomic dataset recorded in roots of the tmk1 - 1 107 mutant or WT exactly after 2 minutes of auxin treatment 15 , 39 , 40 and examined it for evidence of TMK1 - 108 regulated PIN phosphorylation . We identified 12 phospho - sites pertaining to four canonical PINs as 109 putative targets of TMK1 ( Figure 1A ) . Notably , all twelve sites mapped to hydrophilic PIN loops which 110 is the expected location for post - translational modifications regulating PIN polarity and auxin efflux 111 activity 41 . 112 We found two PIN1 phospho - sites ( S271 , S337 ) , five PIN2 phospho - sites ( S179 , S183 , T233 , S393 , 113 S439 ) , and two PIN3 phospho - sites ( S366 , S389 ) significantly hypo - phosphorylated in the tmk1 - 1 114 mutant compared to WT ( Figure 1A ) . The two PIN1 phospho - sites were previously characterized , PIN1 115 S271 as a target of the D6PK protein kinase 26 and PIN1 S337 as a target of the MKK7 - MPK6 module 42 . 116 There were also three hyper - phosphorylated PIN phospho - sites in the tmk1 - 1 mutant , one belonging to 117 PIN3 ( S294 ) and two pertaining to PIN7 ( S297 , S431 ) ( Figure 1A ) . We next examined the role of ABP1 , 118 the auxin receptor upstream of TMK1 15 . We found that eight out of the twelve TMK1 - dependent PIN 119 phospho - sites were also significantly hypo - phosphorylated in the abp1 - TD1 mutant compared to WT 120 ( Figure 1B ) . 121 These observations suggest that auxin very rapidly changes the phospho - status of PIN proteins by a 122 mechanism depending on ABP1 - TMK1 signalling . 123 124 ABP1 - TMK1 is required for polar auxin transport 125 We next addressed whether the ABP1 - TMK1 - mediated PIN phosphorylation has any functional 126 relevance for PIN - mediated polar auxin transport . To this end , we tested basipetal / rootward auxin 127 transport in hypocotyls and basipetal / shootward transport in roots of WT , abp1 , and tmk1 mutants . 128 Application of labelled 3 H - IAA on decapitated etiolated hypocotyls allows monitoring of the NPA - 129 sensitive 43 , mainly PIN1 - dependent downward auxin transport 38 . Indeed , tmk1 - 1 mutant hypocotyls as 130 well as those of both abp1 mutant alleles ( abp1 - C1 and abp1 - TD1 ) showed a decreased rate of 3 H - IAA 131 transport ( Figure 1C and 1D ) . Similarly , application of 3 H - IAA on the root tip and monitoring of 132 predominantly PIN2 - mediated upward auxin transport revealed that the tmk1 - 1 and abp1 mutant roots 133 show a decreased 3 H - IAA transport relative to WT ( Figure 1E ) . Importantly , these defects are 134 complemented in the TMK1 : : TMK1 - FLAG / tmk1 - 1 ( comp - tmk1 - 1 ) and ABP1 : : GFP - ABP1 / abp1 - C1 135 ( comp - C1 ) lines ( Figure 1F ) . 136 Collectively , this shows that deregulated PIN phosphorylation in abp1 and tmk1 mutants correlates with 137 impaired PIN - mediated polar auxin transport in shoots and roots . 138 139 ABP1 mediates auxin - induced activation of TMK1 in roots 140 The action of ABP1 as an auxin receptor , auxin - induced ABP1 - TMK1 interaction , and similar 141 developmental and cellular phenotypes of the corresponding mutants 15 , 16 , suggest that the ABP1 receptor 142 mediates activation of the TMK1 pathway by auxin . This has been also suggested by previous studies , 143 where auxin stimulates TMK1 - dependent ROP2 and ROP6 signalling 16 and TMK1 nanoclustering 44 in 144 pavement cells and MEMBRANE ASSOCIATED KINASE REGULATOR2 ( MAKR2 ) membrane 145 dissociation during root gravitropism 45 . 146 TMKs form a redundant family of 4 LRR - RLKs , for which single mutants have only subtle phenotypes , 147 while higher - order mutants show strong defects in many developmental processes 46 . To focus on TMKs 148 in roots we used available global transcriptomic data ( Figure S1A and S1B ) and generated TMK1 : : GUS , 149 TMK2 : : GUS , TMK3 : : GUS and TMK4 : : GUS lines reporting the corresponding promoter activities . This 150 revealed that TMK1 is the dominant family member highly expressed in roots , followed by TMK3 and 151 TMK4 with lower expression levels ( Figure S1C ) . 152 As an indirect proxy for TMK1 activation in roots we examined the membrane association of ROP6 , 153 which has been shown to act downstream of TMK1 16 . Immunoblotting microsomal root protein extracts 154 from auxin - treated ( IAA , 5 nM , 0 – 120 minutes ) plants with an anti - ROP6 antibody revealed auxin - 155 induced membrane association of ROP6 . This effect was abolished in tmk1 - 1 mutant roots ( Figure 2A 156 and S2E ) , confirming that ROP6 activation by auxin is TMK1 - dependent . 157 To further confirm these observations and test ABP1 involvement in this process , we detected TMK1 - 158 mediated activation of ROP signalling using an orthogonal method . As usual for small GTPases , only 159 GTP - bound ( active ) but not GDP - bound ( inactive ) ROP proteins engage in protein - protein interactions 160 with their effectors . We purified the Cdc42 / Rac interactive binding motif ( CRIB ) domain of the RIC1 161 ROP effector from bacteria and used it to pull down active ROPs from root protein extracts . 162 Immunoblotting with an anti - ROP2 antibody revealed auxin - induced ( IAA , 100 nM , 10 minutes ) ROP2 163 activation in WT but not in tmk1 - 1 roots and importantly neither in abp1 - C1 or abp1 - TD1 roots ( Figure 164 2B ) . These results demonstrate that in roots auxin triggers ROP2 and ROP6 signalling downstream of 165 ABP1 - TMK1 signalling . 166 Next , we analysed TMK1 phosphorylation in response to auxin . The TMK1 kinase domain is known to 167 be capable of auto - phosphorylation 47 , and numerous studies have shown that changes in phosphorylation 168 of the cytoplasmic domain of LRR - RLKs are indicative of LRR - RLK activation in plants 48 , 49 . Therefore , 169 we examined TMK1 phosphorylation by performing a Phos - tag Biotin Probe binding analysis on 170 TMK1 - FLAG immunoprecipitated from auxin - treated ( IAA , 10 nM , 1 hour ) TMK1 : : TMK1 - 171 FLAG / tmk1 - 1 roots . With this approach , we revealed that auxin induced phosphorylation and therefore 172 activation of TMK1 in roots ( Figure 2C and S2C ) . Unexpectedly , we observed that auxin treatment 173 increased not only the [ phospho - TMK1 / total TMK ] ratio ( Figure S2C ) but also the total TMK1 174 abundance ( Figure 2C ) . Immunoblotting microsomal root protein extracts from WT ( anti - TMK1 175 antibody ) , TMK1 : : TMK1 - FLAG ( anti - FLAG antibody ) , and UBQ10 : : TMK1 - 3xHA ( anti - HA antibody ) 176 confirmed auxin - mediated ( anti - TMK1 : IAA , 5 nM , 0 – 120 minutes ; anti - FLAG / HA : IAA , 5 or 10 or 177 100 nM , 1 hour ) increase in TMK1 abundance ( Figure 2A , S2A , S2B and S2E ) . In contrast , TMK1 178 mRNA levels as determined by RT - qPCR did not increase but rather decreased with IAA treatment 179 ( IAA , 10 or 100 nM , 0 – 120 minutes : Figure S2D ) . This suggests that auxin upregulates TMK1 180 abundance on the protein level rather than transcriptionally . We also monitored TMK1 - GFP signal after 181 auxin treatment ( IAA , 5 or 10 nM , 3 . 5 - hour time course ) of TMK1 : : TMK1 - GFP / WT roots . In agreement 182 with biochemical data , concentrations as low as 5 nM of IAA led to a strong increase in the TMK1 - GFP 183 signal ( Figure 2D and 2E ) . 184 In totality , our experiments in roots suggest that auxin , via ABP1 , promotes TMK1 phosphorylation and 185 stabilization at the plasma membrane , underlying TMK1 activation and leading to downstream 186 signalling . This provides a possible mechanism for how auxin could act through the ABP1 - TMK1 187 pathway to trigger phosphorylation of PINs and other targets . 188 189 TMK1 interacts with and phosphorylates PIN2 190 Given that most TMK1 - regulated PIN phospho - sites were identified in PIN2 ( Figure 1A ) and its 191 prominent role in root gravitropism , we further focused on PIN2 as a representative of PINs . 192 To address whether TMK1 regulates PIN2 directly , we performed a co - immunoprecipitation analysis 193 ( Co - IP ) between endogenous PIN2 and TMK1 . We immunoprecipitated TMK1 - FLAG from 194 TMK1 : : TMK1 - FLAG / tmk1 - 1 roots and then used an anti - PIN2 antibody for detection of native PIN2 . 195 PIN2 did not co - immunoprecipitate with TMK1 - FLAG in untreated samples . However , in auxin - treated 196 roots ( IAA , 5 or 20 nM , 15 or 30 minutes ) we could co - immunoprecipitate PIN2 with TMK1 - FLAG 197 and the Co - IP efficiency increased with the duration of IAA treatment ( Figure 3A and S3A ) , suggesting 198 an auxin - dependent interaction of TMK1 with PIN2 . 199 To verify the biochemical evidence for TMK1 - PIN2 interaction , we employed the quantitative FRET - 200 FLIM technique . We co - expressed 35S : : TMK1 - GFP and 35S : : PIN2 - mCherry in Arabidopsis root 201 protoplasts and measured the fluorescence lifetime of the GFP signal . The lifetime of TMK1 - GFP was 202 reduced after co - expression with PIN2 - mCherry , which supported the interaction between TMK1 and 203 PIN2 ( Figure 3B ) . The negative controls , an unrelated receptor - like kinase FLS2 - GFP and TMK1 ΔKD - 204 GFP with a truncated kinase domain , showed a less pronounced decrease in fluorescence lifetime , 205 confirming the specificity of the TMK1 - PIN2 interaction ( Figure 3B and S3B ) . 206 Given the direct interaction of TMK1 with PIN2 , it seemed likely that at least some of the TMK1 - 207 regulated PIN2 phospho - sites ( Figure 1A ) could be ascribed to direct phosphorylation by TMK1 . To 208 test this , we performed an in vitro phosphorylation assay with 32 P - ATP as a phosphate donor by 209 incubating a purified N - terminal His - tagged hydrophilic loop ( HL ) of PIN2 with TMK1 - 3xHA 210 immunoprecipitated from a root protein extract . These in vitro assays showed that TMK1 - 3xHA 211 mediated the phosphorylation of His - PIN2 HL . Notably , only intact TMK1 - HA but not the kinase - dead 212 version TMK1 K616R - HA was able to phosphorylate His - PIN2 - HL ( Figure 3C ) . We did not observe any 213 auxin effect in these kinase assays ( Figure S3C ) , but this could be explained if TMK1 - 3HA activity was 214 already saturated by endogenous auxin during immunoprecipitation from TMK1 - 3xHA roots . 215 In conclusion , our data demonstrate that the receptor - like kinase TMK1 interacts , in an auxin - dependent 216 manner , with the PIN2 auxin efflux carrier and phosphorylates its hydrophilic loop . 217 218 TMK1 modulates PIN2 levels during the root response to exogenous auxin 219 The compromised PIN2 - mediated shootward auxin transport in abp1 and tmk1 mutant roots ( Figure 1 ) 220 suggested an involvement of ABP1 - TMK1 signalling in PIN2 functionality . Therefore , we tested 221 whether TMK1 - mediated PIN2 phosphorylation influences its polarity and abundance , both of which 222 are known to be regulated by phosphorylation 41 . We did not observe any obvious changes in PIN2 223 polarity as assessed by anti - PIN2 immunolocalization experiments in tmk1 mutants ( data not shown ) , 224 thus we examined the effects of auxin on PIN2 levels in WT and tmk1 - 1 by immunoblotting microsomal 225 root samples with an anti - PIN2 antibody . In WT , 5 nM IAA stabilized PIN2 over the course of a 1 - hour 226 treatment , but after 2 hours PIN2 decreased below starting levels ( Figure 4A and S4A ) . With 10 nM 227 IAA , however , PIN2 was destabilized already after 1 hour ( Figure S4B ) . Such complex PIN2 dynamics 228 in response to short versus long auxin treatments were described before for the synthetic auxin NAA 35 , 50 . 229 Investigation of PIN2 transcription by RT - qPCR confirmed that regulation of PIN2 stability by auxin is 230 independent of transcription ( Figure S4C ) . Thus , auxin initially stabilizes and after a prolonged exposure 231 destabilizes PIN2 , consistent with previous reports 19 , 35 . 232 Notably , the tmk1 - 1 mutant exhibited premature PIN2 stabilization by IAA and showed resistance to 233 long - term PIN2 downregulation ( Figure 4A , S4A and S4B ) . We further assessed PIN2 abundance in 234 auxin - treated WT and tmk1 - 1 roots by live imaging . IAA treatment of PIN2 - GFP roots caused a decrease 235 in the GFP signal in a concentration - dependent manner . This auxin effect was not observed or even 236 reverted in the tmk1 - 1 mutant ( Figure 4b and 4C ) , overall indicating that TMK1 mediates PIN2 237 destabilization , which is triggered by exogenous auxin . 238 239 TMK1 kinase activity is required for the root gravitropic response 240 To test the relevance of our observations on PIN2 regulation by auxin and by TMK1 in a physiological 241 context , we focused on gravitropism , a classic developmental process during which membrane PIN2 242 levels undergo dynamic spatiotemporal changes 35 , 36 , and which has been proposed to be regulated by 243 TMK1 and its inhibitory protein MAKR2 45 . Analysis of root growth in verified tmk single mutants 244 ( Figure S5A ) did not show obvious defects in growth rate ( Figure S5C ) , but time - lapse imaging of root 245 bending following gravistimulation revealed slower gravitropic response kinetics compared to WT 246 plants . This defect was most pronounced in the tmk1 - 1 mutant and complemented in the TMK1 : : TMK1 - 247 FLAG / tmk1 - 1 line ( Figure 5A and 5B ; Figure S5B and S5C ; Table S1 and S2 ) . tmk4 - 1 roots also bent 248 less efficiently ; tmk3 - 1 had a very weak defect , whereas tmk2 - 1 showed normal gravitropic bending 249 ( Figure S5B and S5C ; Table S2 ) , which is consistent with the very low expression of TMK2 in the root 250 ( Figure S1A , S1B and S1C ) . Notably , the kinase activity of TMK1 is required for its role in root 251 gravitropism since the expression of TMK1 without a kinase domain ( 35S : : TMK1 ΔKD - GFP ) or TMK1 252 carrying a mutation in the ATP - binding site ( UBQ10 : : TMK1 K616R - mCherry ) also conveyed defects in 253 root gravitropism , even when introduced into WT plants ( Figure 5A and 5B ; Figure S5D and S5E ; Table 254 S2 ) . Of note , the two kinase - dead lines showed fluorescent signal distribution comparable to that of 255 TMK1 : : TMK1 - GFP ( Figure S1D and S5F ) . 256 Next , we tested whether TMK1 is involved in gravity - induced auxin re - distribution by introducing the 257 DR5rev : : GFP auxin response reporter into the tmk1 - 1 loss - of - function mutant . Monitoring the DR5 258 signal following gravistimulation showed significantly less auxin response asymmetry in the tmk1 - 1 259 mutant as compared to WT control ( Figure 5C and 5D ) . 260 These results show that , during root gravitropism , TMK1 is involved in both the asymmetric distribution 261 of auxin and in root bending . 262 263 TMK1 mediates PIN2 asymmetry during root gravitropic response 264 Having confirmed that TMK1 signalling is required for the root gravitropic response and given that 265 TMK1 mediates PIN2 phosphorylation ( Figure 1A and 3C ) and stability ( Figure 4 ) , we examined the 266 dynamic regulation of PIN2 abundance in response to gravity by immunoblotting microsomal root 267 protein extracts . After 1 hour of gravistimulation , WT roots showed modest PIN2 stabilization ; this was 268 followed by a decrease below starting levels at the 2 - hours timepoint without further changes for the 269 rest of the time course ( Figure 6A and S6C ) . The tmk1 - 1 mutant PIN2 levels , however , increased 270 dramatically after 1 hour of gravistimulation and then slowly recovered back to the starting value after 271 4 hours of gravistimulation . This biochemical evidence reveals dynamic regulation of total PIN2 272 abundance during gravitropism , which is mediated by TMK1 . 273 To gain more spatial insights into the behaviour of PIN2 during the gravity response , we performed live 274 imaging and followed PIN2 - GFP asymmetry in WT and tmk1 - 1 roots after gravistimulation . While WT 275 roots established asymmetric PIN2 distribution as expected , this response was abrogated in the tmk1 - 1 276 mutant ( Figure 6C and 6D ) . Importantly , the tmk1 - 1 mutant showed defects in both PIN2 stabilization 277 at the lower side of the root ( from 2 hours onwards ) and in the destabilization of PIN2 at the upper side 278 of the root ( the 3 hours timepoint ) ( Figure 6D ) . 279 Thus , TMK1 orchestrates a complex , dynamic regulation of PIN2 abundance during gravitropism which 280 provides a likely explanation for the gravitropic phenotype of the tmk1 mutant . 281 282 TMK1 activity and asymmetric abundance during root gravitropism 283 The gravitropic phenotype of tmk1 - 1 roots suggested to us that TMK1 might become activated during 284 the root gravitropic response . Immunoblotting WT root microsomal fractions from gravistimulated 285 seedlings with an anti - ROP6 antibody confirmed that gravistimulation activated ROP6 signalling . The 286 absence of these dynamics in the tmk1 - 1 mutant showed that gravity - induced ROP6 activation was 287 TMK1 - dependent ( Figure 6A and S6C ) . We subsequently conducted a Phos - tag Biotin Probe binding 288 analysis on TMK1 - FLAG immunoprecipitated from gravistimulated TMK1 : : TMK1 - FLAG / tmk1 - 1 289 roots . This revealed a significant increase in TMK1 phosphorylation already after 1 hour of 290 gravistimulation ( Figure 6B and S6D ) demonstrating that gravistimulation activates TMK1 . Similar to 291 our experiments with a time course of exogenous auxin ( Figure 2A and 2C ) , we noted an increase in 292 TMK1 abundance over the course of gravistimulation ( Figure 6B ) . Increasing TMK1 levels were also 293 apparent from Western blots performed on microsomal root extracts from gravistimulated seedlings 294 ( Figure 6A ; Figure S6A , S6B and S6C ) . Collectively , these data show that gravistimulation activates 295 TMK1 signalling in roots by impacting both the TMK1 phosphorylation status and stability . 296 To gain additional spatial information on this regulation , we performed live imaging on the 297 TMK1 : : TMK1 - GFP line . Strikingly , we observed that after 1 hour of gravistimulation TMK1 - GFP 298 developed an asymmetric pattern with higher signal intensity along the lower root side , which was 299 getting more pronounced over time ( Figure 6E and 6F ) . This result is consistent with auxin accumulating 300 at the lower root side stabilizing TMK1 as seen for exogenous auxin application ( Figure 2D and 2E ) . 301 This implies the existence of additional signals / regulations at the lower side of the root during the 302 graviresponse or some compensatory mechanism in the tmk1 - 1 mutant , which causes bulk stabilization 303 of PIN2 and overshadows the fact that , in WT roots , the function of TMK1 is to stabilize PIN2 at the 304 lower root side shortly after gravistimulation . It is tempting to propose a model in which TMK1 305 stabilization at the lower root side reinforces PIN2 asymmetry to confer robustness on root gravitropism 306 in land plants , however , it remains a challenge for future studies to fully consolidate all the above - 307 mentioned intriguing observations . 308 Nonetheless , our data reveal crucial importance of TMK1 for dynamic PIN2 - mediated fluxes and auxin 309 asymmetry in driving root gravitropism . Notably , auxin - triggered TMK1 - PIN2 interaction and 310 phosphorylation provides a plausible mechanism for how this regulation occurs . 311 312 DISCUSSION 313 314 ABP1 relays auxin signal for TMK1 activation and stabilization 315 Cell surface auxin signalling , unlike the TIR1 / AFB transcriptional pathway based predominantly in the 316 nucleus 51 , has been a matter of considerable controversy 52 . Only recently was it confirmed in 317 Arabidopsis that ABP1 acts as an apoplastic auxin - binding receptor 15 , which associates to the 318 extracellular domain of TMK1 16 . This provides a plausible mechanism for how extracellular auxin can 319 induce via ABP1 the phosphorylation of proteins in the cell interior , either directly through the cytosolic 320 kinase domain of TMK1 or through downstream kinase cascades . Indeed , abp1 and tmk1 mutants show 321 aberrant and highly inter - correlated phospho - proteomes 15 , 39 . Overall , the auxin - induced ABP1 - TMK1 322 association 16 , failure of abp1 mutants to maintain steady - state TMK phosphorylation 15 , and the lack of 323 ROP signalling downstream of TMK1 in response to auxin ( Figure 2B and 16 ) strongly support the notion 324 that ABP1 acts as a receptor communicating auxin for TMK - mediated phosphorylation . 325 It comes as a surprise that auxin not only induces TMK1 phosphorylation but also its persistent 326 stabilization . This is to be contrasted with the usual textbook signalling paradigm where prolonged 327 stimulation desensitizes the pathway in question . For instance , mammalian receptor tyrosine kinases 328 such as the EPIDERMAL GROWTH FACTOR RECEPTOR ( EGFR ) are endocytosed and almost 329 completely degraded within 1 - 2 hours of ligand application 53 , 54 . This peculiar TMK1 behaviour may 330 constitute a part of the positive feedback linking auxin to its transport that has been proposed as a central 331 mechanism behind canalization - mediated self - organized plant development 3 . It is conceivable that 332 canalization would rely on a positive feedback loop which persists until the process is completed rather 333 than on rapid desensitization . Furthermore , extracellular auxin perception has been predicted as a key 334 signalling input parameter for auxin canalization 18 . Consistent with these notions , auxin canalization 335 and canalization - mediated vascular tissue regeneration are severely defective in abp1 and tmk mutants 15 . 336 Despite these strong , specific defects , overall growth and development is not strongly affected following 337 single - gene lesions within the ABP1 - TMK pathway , which can be explained by the genetic redundancy 338 between TMKs 46 and between ABP1 and its homologues 55 . Thus , ABP1 - TMK cell surface signalling is 339 a likely input component of the positive feedback central to the auxin canalization mechanism . 340 341 Auxin induced TMK1 - PIN2 interaction and phosphorylation for PIN2 stability 342 The biological roles of the global , ultrafast phosphorylation downstream of ABP1 - TMK1 remain 343 unclear but prominent among the phosphorylated targets are multiple PIN auxin transporters ( Figure 344 1A , 1B and 39 ) . The activity , stability and polar localization of PINs are known to be regulated heavily 345 by complex phosphorylation on multiple sites by different types of kinases in response to various 346 signals 41 . Accordingly , PIN - mediated auxin transport in shoots and roots of abp1 and tmk1 mutants is 347 compromised ( Figure 1C - F ) implying that PIN regulation by ABP1 - TMK1 is functionally relevant . 348 It appears clear that ABP1 transmits the auxin signal to TMKs for their phosphorylation and activation , 349 thus enabling the phosphorylation of downstream targets such as PINs . What part of the phosphorylation 350 response emanating from ABP1 - TMK1 is attributable to direct TMK1 action on substrate proteins , 351 however , remains elusive . At least in the case of PINs , as exemplified by PIN1 56 and PIN2 ( Figure 3 ) , 352 TMK1 engages in a direct interaction and in an auxin - dependent manner phosphorylates multiple 353 residues within their hydrophilic loops . While for PIN1 the phosphorylation seems relevant to its polar 354 localization in tissues 56 , PIN2 undergoes dynamic stabilization and destabilization in response to the 355 TMK1 - transduced auxin phospho - signalling . The former scenario is likely relevant to classical auxin 356 canalization , the latter for fine - tuning of auxin fluxes during root gravitropism . Thus , distinct PINs 357 phosphorylated by TMK1 at different residues can be regulated by auxin in ways depending on the 358 developmental context . Regardless of specifics of the regulation , the auxin input via ABP1 - TMK1 and 359 its direct modulation of PIN activity represent a core mechanism for the positive feedback between auxin 360 signalling and directional transport . 361 362 TMK1 - PIN2 module during root gravitropism 363 PIN2 evolved as a specific component of efficient root gravitropism of seed plants , which contributed 364 to their successful colonization of land habitats 27 . The key evolutionary innovation has been the 365 directional , PIN2 - mediated auxin flow that carries the signal from the site of gravity perception at the 366 root tip to the site of growth response in the elongation zone 28 . Notably , PIN2 abundance also becomes 367 asymmetric with more PIN2 at the lower root side 35 , 36 , which reinforces the initial auxin gradient and 368 contributes to the robustness of the root bending response 37 . This provides an excellent model to study 369 the interplay of auxin signalling and transport . TMK1 is required for the full extent of asymmetric auxin 370 distribution and for root bending during the gravitropic response . This is elegantly explained by the fact 371 that tmk1 roots cannot establish asymmetric PIN2 distribution during the graviresponse ( Figure 6C , 6D 372 and 57 ) . TMK1 protein abundance increases dynamically during root gravitropism along the lower side 373 of the root , mirroring the asymmetric auxin distribution and PIN2 accumulation . 374 The above observations lead to a model in which the initial auxin flow asymmetry following 375 gravistimulation activates and stabilizes TMK1 at the lower root side and promotes its interaction with 376 PIN2 , leading to PIN2 phosphorylation . This positive feedback loop between auxin and PIN2 - mediated 377 transport reinforces the auxin flow at the lower root side and contributes to a robust gravitropic response . 378 However , TMK1 - mediated persistent PIN2 destabilization in response to exogenous auxin treatment 379 ( Figure 4 ) is not consistent with PIN2 stabilization at the place of elevated auxin along the lower side of 380 the gravistimulated root , indicating a possible hidden complexity and variables . Regardless of these 381 additional regulations , the asymmetric action of TMK1 following gravistimulation and the TMK1 - PIN2 382 feedback loop clearly are required for PIN2 asymmetry during gravitropism , and consequently for a 383 robust bending response . 384 385 Conclusions 386 Here we identified a mechanism for the positive feedback between auxin and its transport , which is a 387 key prerequisite for canalization - guided plant development . It involves auxin - triggered phosphorylation 388 of multiple PIN auxin transporters . Exemplified by PIN2 , this regulation involves a direct interaction 389 with the TMK1 receptor - like kinase . The input for TMK1 activation comes from auxin binding to the 390 ABP1 receptor at the cell surface , resulting in TMK1 phosphorylation , long - term TMK1 stabilization at 391 the plasma membrane , and activation of downstream processes . This positive feedback regulation is 392 required in the case of PIN2 for robust asymmetric auxin fluxes during root gravitropism and in the case 393 of PIN1 56 most likely for auxin canalization - mediated flexible vascular tissue formation and 394 regeneration . Thus , TMK - based auxin feedback regulation may represent a more general mechanism 395 acting in different developmental contexts with different PIN transporters , thereby mediating specialized 396 aspects of adaptive and self - organized development in plants . It is remarkable that the herein identified 397 auxin feedback on its transport via TMK - based cell surface signalling likely evolved from an ancestral 398 and ancient phosphorylation response to the small molecule auxin 39 , 40 , later diversifying to guide the 399 complex and flexible auxin - regulated development of morphologically complex land plants . 400 401 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 402 We thank W .

The T - DNA insertion lines eir1 - 4 ( SALK _ 091142 ) [ pin2 698 mutant used in Figure 1 ] , tmk1 - 1 ( SALK _ 016360 ) , tmk2 - 1 ( SAIL _ 1242 _ H07 ) , tmk3 - 1 ( SALK _ 129759 ) 699 and tmk4 - 1 ( GABI _ 348E01 ) were previously reported 35 , 59 , as was abp1 - C1 and abp1 - TD1 60 , and comp - 700 C1 = ( ABP1 : : GFP - ABP1 / abp1 - C1 ) 61 . The primers for genotyping are described in Supplementary 701 Table 3 . PIN2 : : PIN2 - GFP , DR5rev : : GFP and TMK1 : : TMK1 - FLAG in tmk1 - 1 ( comp - tmk1 - 1 ) were 702 described 59 , 62 , 63 . DEX : : TMK1 K616R - HA line ( unpublished ) was kindly provided by William Gray . We 703 generated transgenic lines PIN2 : : PIN2 - GFP in tmk1 - 1 and DR5rev : : GFP in tmk1 - 1 by crossing the 704 respective markers and the mutant line . 705 To generate TMK1 : : GUS , TMK2 : : GUS , TMK3 : : GUS , and TMK4 : : GUS transgenic lines , genomic 706 fragments covering 2000 bp upstream from the start codon of TMK1 , TMK2 , TMK3 and TMK4 were 707 amplified from Col - 0 genomic DNA as a promotor region . We used these primers for amplification : 708 pTMK1 - B4 - F / pTMK1 - B1 - R , pTMK2 - B4 - F / pTMK2 - B1 - R , pTMK3 - B4 - F / pTMK3 - B1 - R , pTMK4 - B4 - 709 F / pTMK4 - B1 - R ( see sequences in Supplemental Table 3 ) . The promoter fragments were inserted into 710 pDONR P4 - P1r vector by BP recombination reaction , resulting in pDONR P4 - P1R pTMK1 , pDONR 711 P4 - P1R pTMK2 , pDONR P4 - P1R pTMK3 , and pDONR P4 - P1R pTMK4 plasmids . Those products were 712 subsequently cloned into pB7m24GW . 3 vector together with pEN - L1 - GUS - L2 ( Invitrogen ) by 713 MultiSite Gateway LR recombination reaction . To generate TMK1 : : TMK1 - GFP , 35S : : TMK1 ∆KD - GFP 714 expressing lines , the TMK1 full length / TMK1 ∆KD ( amino acid 1 - 587 ) genomic DNA without stop codon 715 were amplified from DNA of Col - 0 seedlings by PCR using TMK1 - FL - B1 - F and TMK1 - FL - B2 - 716 R / TMK1 - ∆KD - B2 - R primers ( see sequences Supplemental Table 3 ) , respectively . The corresponding 717 TMK1 DNA sequences were inserted into pDONR221 vector by BP recombination reaction . Next , for 718 TMK1 : : TMK1 - GFP construct , pDONR P4 - P1R pTMK1 , pDONR221 gTMK1 and pDONR P2R - P3 719 GFP ; for 35S : : TMK1 ∆KD - GFP , pDONR P4 - P1R p35S , pDONR221 gTMK1 ∆KD and pDONR P2R - P3 720 GFP were cloned into pB7m34GW vector by MultiSite Gateway LR recombination reaction . To 721 generate UBQ10 : : TMK1 K616R - 2xmCherry , TMK1 K616R noSTOP / pDONR221 was obtained by site directed 722 mutagenesis , amplifying pDONR221 TMK1 with the TMK1KD - K616F / TMK1KD - K616R primer pair . 723 pDONR221 TMK1 K616R was then recombined by LR reaction with pDONR P4 - P1R pUBQ10 64 , pDONR 724 P2R - P3 2xmCHERRY - 4xMyc 65 and pH7m34GW 66 to introduce UBQ10 : : TMK1 K616R - 2xmCherry in 725 pH7m34GW . All constructs were transformed into the Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain pGV3101 by 726 electroporation and further into Col - 0 plants by floral dip method . After being selected for single - copy 727 insertions , two individual homozygous T3 transgenic lines were used for further studies . 728 Arabidopsi s thaliana seeds were surface - sterilized with 70 % ( v / v ) ethanol for 20 min , followed by 729 commercial bleach ( 2 . 5 % [ v / v ] sodium hypochlorite ) containing 0 . 05 % ( v / v ) Triton X - 100 for 10 min , 730 and finally washed four times with sterile distilled water . The stratification of the seeds was conducted 731 in the dark at 4°C for 3 days . Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings were grown at 22°C on ½ MS plates with 732 1 % agar and 1 % sucrose , or in soil with 16h light / 8h dark cycles , photoperiod at 80 to 100 mE m – 2 sec – 733 1 . 734 735 Measurement of basipetal auxin transport in roots 736 Root basipetal auxin transport measurement was executed as previously described 67 . Briefly , 5 - day - old 737 Arabidopsis seedlings were neatly placed on ½ MS plates and vertically grown for around 12 hours . 100 738 nM 3 H - IAA droplets were prepared by adding 2 µl of 25 Ci mmol - 1 3 H - IAA to 1 ml ½ MS with 1 . 25 739 % agar and quickly added dropwise onto a humid petri dish lid . Then the auxin - containing droplets were 740 carefully placed on root tips with about 0 . 5 mm overlap . Transport was allowed for 5 hours in darkness 741 at room temperature . 2 mm of root tissue proximal to the site of auxin application was discarded , and 742 an 8 - mm root segment was cut from the rest of the root tip and harvested to 3 ml of scintillation fluid . 743 Radioactivity was counted with a scintillation counter ( HIDEX 300 SL ) for 100 seconds . 10 seedlings 744 were used for each treatment with 3 repetitions . 745 746 Measurement of basipetal auxin transport in shoots 747 Shoot basipetal auxin transport was carried out as previously described 68 . Briefly , surface - sterilized 748 A rabidopsis thaliana seeds were stratified in the dark at 4°C for 72 h , placed in the light for 6 hours to 749 induce germination and transferred to the darkness at 22°C for 5 days . Then , 5 - day - old etiolated 750 hypocotyls were decapitated to exclude the effect of auxin biosynthesis in cotyledons and 3 H - IAA 751 droplets ( 60 nM : 12 µL 3 H - IAA in 10 mL of ½ MS medium with 1 . 25 % agar ) were carefully applied to 752 the apical part of the hypocotyls . After 6 hours incubation , treated hypocotyls were collected , 753 homogenized in liquid nitrogen and incubated overnight in Opti - Fluor scintillation cocktail ( Perkin 754 Elmer ) . Finally , the radioactivity was measured with a scintillation counter ( Hidex 300SL ) for 755 300 seconds . 10 seedlings were used for each treatment with 3 repetitions . An additional background 756 control for any diffusion though the agar was performed by inserting the droplet above the decapitated 757 hypocotyl and treatment with 10 μM NPA as a negative control . 758 759 Mutant evaluation and expression analysis by RT - qPCR . 760 For RT - qPCR analyses , total RNA was prepared from max . 100mg of roots of 4 - day - old seedlings 761 according to the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit ( Qiagen ) . cDNA was synthesized from 1µg of total mRNA 762 using the QuantiNova Reverse Transcription Kit ( Qiagen ) . For all mutant expression analyses , four 763 biological replicates were considered , and the samples were pipetted in three technical replicates into a 764 384 well plate using an automated JANUS Workstation ( PerkinElmer ) . According to the manufacturer’s 765 instructions , 5 µL reaction volume contained 2 . 5 µL Luna® Universal qPCR mastermix ( NEB ) . RT - 766 qPCR analyses were performed using the Real - time PCR Roche Lightcycler 480 and the expression of 767 PP2AA3 ( At1G13320 ) was used as in 69 . For each of the evaluated genes , three different primer pairs 768 were evaluated , and representative graphs are enclosed in the manuscript . The primers used for the 769 presented analyses are listed in Supplemental Table 3 . 770 771 Förster Resonance Energy Transfer with Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy ( FRET - 772 FLIM ) . 773 FRET - FLIM experiments were performed in protoplast systems isolated from Arabidopsis root cell 774 suspension as described previously 70 . 10 µg of plasmid DNA ( TMK1 - GFP , TMK1 ∆KD - GFP , PIN2 - 775 mCherry , FLS2 - GFP ) were used for protoplast transfection and then incubated in a sterile 24 - well 776 microtiter plate overnight in the dark at room temperature . FRET - FLIM experiments were performed 777 using a TriM Scope II inverted 2 - photon microscope equipped with a FLIM X16 TCSPC Detector for 778 time correlated single photon counting ( LaVision BioTec ) . Fluorescence lifetime image stacks ( 150 779 slices , with 0 , 082 ns time interval ) were acquired . Image analyses were done in Fiji by performing a 780 threshold mask from the sum projection of each stack and by averaging all the pixels at each time point 781 of the stack . In order to yield the exponential decay with offset , the intensity at time point 0 was 782 normalized . 783 784 Histochemical GUS staining . 785 4 - day - old seedlings of TMK1 : : GUS , TMK3 : : GUS and TMK4 : : GUS were stained in 0 . 1 M sodium 786 phosphate buffer ( pH 7 . 0 ) containing 0 . 1 % X - GlcA sodium salt , 1 mM K 3 [ Fe ( CN ) 6 ] , 1 mM K 4 [ Fe ( CN ) 6 ] 787 and 0 . 05 % Triton X - 100 for 20 min ( TMK1 : : GUS ) , 2 h ( TMK4 : : GUS ) or 6 h ( TMK3 : : GUS ) at 37°C . 788 Further , samples were incubated overnight in 80 % ( v / v ) ethanol at room temperature .

Input samples were isolated from total protein extracts , before 892 addition of Triton X - 100 to get an estimate of the present total ROP content . 893 894 Quantitative immunoblot analysis . 895 To determine the relative amount of protein in time course experiments , grey values were calculated by 896 ImageJ Gel Analysis tool , where for each band of protein of interest ( PI ) and normalizing control ( NC ) , 897 membrane background was removed individually . To get relative NC value , all the NC values were 898 divided by the highest one . Subsequently , all the PI values were divided by their respective relative NC 899 values . Final obtained values of PI were normalized dividing by the time point 0 or DMSO control 900 treatment value . Values from three independent experiments were used to determine average and ±SD . 901 For example , for quantitative immunoblot analysis of phosphorylated proteins , it was first determined 902 grey values of TMK1 obtained with Phos - tag BTL - 111 probe and anti - Flag antibody at different time 903 points / treatments , tacking into account each membrane background . TMK1 - Flag values were used as a 904 protein amount normalizing control ( NC ) . To get NC values of each experiment point , TMK1 - Flag 905 values were divided by the highest one . Subsequently , TMK1 Phos - tag values were divided by their 906 respective relative NC values . To compare differences between time points / treatments , as a final step , 907 the normalized at protein level TMK1 Phos - tag values were divided by the corresponding time point 0 908 or DMSO control treatment values . 909 910 Recombinant protein expression and purification from E . coli . 911 The 6xHis - PIN2 HL recombinant protein was expressed using the 6xHis - PIN2 HL vector 74 in E . coli 912 BL21 ( DE3 ) strain upon induction by 0 . 5 mM IPTG ( Isopropyl β - D - 1 - Thiogalactopyranoside ) at 16°C 913 for 12 h . Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 g for 15 min and washed with water . They were 914 then lysed by sonication in lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl pH7 . 5 ; 150 mM NaCl ; 1 mM EDTA ; 1 mM 915 DTT and 1 % TritonX100 ) . The lysed solution was centrifuged at 12000 g for 15 min . The supernatant 916 was then purified using Ni - NTA His affinity agarose ( Thermo Scientific ) according to the 917 manufacturer’s instructions . 6xHis - PIN2 HL protein was eluted from the beads in elution buffer ( 50 918 mM Tris - HCl pH7 . 4 ; 150 mM NaCl and 250 mM imidazole ) . Eluted protein samples were checked by 919 SDS - PAGE and Coomassie brilliant blue staining ( Bio - Safe™ Coomassie Stain , Bio - Rad ) . The protein 920 concentration was determined with the Bradford method ( Quick Start™ Bradford Reagent , Bio - Rad ) . 921 922 TMK1 - HA immunoprecipitation . 923 To immunoprecipitate HA - tagged TMK1 protein , roots of 7 - day - old pUBQ10 : : TMK1 - 3xHA and 924 DEX : : TMK1 K616R - HA ( previously induced for 48 h with 30 µM dexamethasone ) seedlings were frozen 925 and grounded in a liquid nitrogen , and , subsequently , homogenized in protein extraction buffer ( PEB : 926 50 mM Tris - HCl pH7 . 5 , 200 mM NaCl , 1 % TritonX100 , 10 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM MnCl 2 , Complete 927 ( Roche ) protease cocktail and PhosSTOP phosphatase inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) ) , followed by the 20 928 min centrifugation step at 14000 g , 4°C . In a fresh Eppendorf tube , 50 µL anti - HA agarose beads were 929 added ( Anti - HA Affinity Matrix , SIGMA ; pre - washed with 200 µL PEB ) to the supernatant . After 4 h 930 of rotating at 4°C , the samples were spun down again at 2000 g , 4°C , and the supernatant was discarded . 931 The Agarose beads were washed twice with 200 µL PEB , and finally re - suspended into 50 µL PEB to 932 allow further biochemical reactions . 933 934 In vitro kinase assay . 935 The in vitro kinase assay with [ γ - 32 P ] - ATP was conducted as reported 74 with minor modifications . 936 Immunoprecipated TMK1 - HA and TMK1 K616R - HA ( 5 µL ) from 7 - day - old Arabidopsis seedlings , 937 together with the recombinant 6xHis - PIN2 HL ( 10 µL ) from E . coli , were added to the kinase reaction 938 buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 5 , 10 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM NaCl , 2 . 5 mM cold ATP ( adenosine 5 ' - 939 triphosphate ) , and 1 mM DTT ) in the presence of 5 μCi [ γ - 32 P ] - ATP ( NEG502A001MC ; Perkin - Elmer ) . 940 Reactions were incubated at 25°C for 90 min and afterwards terminated by adding 10 µL 5×SDS loading 941 buffer . 20 µL reaction samples were then separated with 10 % SDS - PAGE gel , developed with a 942 phosphor - plate overnight . Eventually , the phosphor - plate was imaged with a Fujifilm FLA 3000 plus 943 DAGE system . 944 945 Statistical analysis . 946 Data visualization was conducted using the GraphPad Prism 8 Software or in R version 4 . 0 . 4 . For 947 statistical comparisons we used standard linear models ( t - test , one - or two - way ANOVA with Dunnett’s 948 multiple comparisons ) after first checking their assumptions . Some charts in Figure 1 represent pooled 949 data from multiple experiments . In such cases , we fitted mixed linear models with restricted maximum 950 likelihood using the lme ( ) function implemeted as part of the nlme R package . We tested the influence 951 of genotype / treatment as a fixed effect ( type II analysis of deviance ) and included experimental 952 repetition as a random effect . The random effect was tested by comparing a model where it was included 953 to a model with just the fixed effect using the gls ( ) function . The result was reported as the amount by 954 which the Akaike Information Criterion ( AIC ) of the model increased when excluding the random effect , 955 along with the associated p - value . 956 957 Accession Numbers 958 Sequence data from this article can be found in the Arabidopsis Genome Initiative databases under the 959 following accession numbers : At4g02980 for ABP1 , At1g66150 for TMK1 , At1g24650 for TMK2 , 960 At2g01820 for TMK3 , At3g23750 for TMK4 , At5g57090 for PIN2 , At1g20090 for ROP2 , At4g35020 961 for ROP6 , At4g30190 for AHA2 , At5g46330 for FLS2 . 962 963 964 965 966 967 968 969 970 971 972 973 974 975 976 977 REFERENCES 978 1 .
