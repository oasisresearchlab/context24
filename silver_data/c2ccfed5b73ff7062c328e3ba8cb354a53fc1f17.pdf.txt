In erythroid cells , the locus control region ( LCR ) and b - globin promoter form a chromatin loop that requires transcription factor GATA1 and the associ - ated molecule Ldb1 . We employed artiﬁcial zinc ﬁngers ( ZF ) to tether Ldb1 to the b - globin promoter in GATA1 null erythroblasts , in which the b - globin locus is relaxed and inactive . Remarkably , targeting Ldb1 or only its self - association domain to the b - globin promoter substantially activated b - globin transcription in the absence of GATA1 . Promoter - tethered Ldb1 interacted with endogenous Ldb1 complexes at the LCR to form a chromatin loop , causing recruitment and phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II . ZF - Ldb1 proteins were inactive at alleles lacking the LCR , demonstrating that their activities depend on long - range interactions . Our ﬁndings establish Ldb1 as a critical effector of GATA1 - mediated loop formation and indicate that chromatin looping causally underlies gene regulation . INTRODUCTION Gene activity is controlled by a combination of proximal and distal regulatory elements that can be separated by up to hundreds of kilobases . Long - standing questions include how these elements interact functionally to regulate gene expression , how gene speciﬁcity is achieved , and how unwanted effects on nearby irrelevant genes are avoided . The use of chromosome conformation capture ( 3C ) and its derivatives has revealed that distant chromosomal elements can be juxtaposed to form chro - matin loops , thus providing one mechanism of long - range enhancer function ( Cullen et al . , 1993 ; Dekker et al . , 2002 ) . Chro - matin looping has been discovered at numerous gene loci and reﬂects a widespread organizing principle of the chromatin ﬁber ( for review , see Dean , 2011 ; Kadauke and Blobel , 2009 ; Miele and Dekker , 2008 ; Schoenfelder et al . , 2010 ; Sexton et al . , 2009 ) . Although looping can occur at genes prior to their full activation , the onset of transcription is tightly associated with additional looped interactions ( Palstra et al . , 2003 ; Spilianakis and Flavell , 2004 ; Vernimmen et al . , 2007 ) . However , based on studies using pharmacological inhibitors of transcription elongation , it has become clear that ongoing transcription is dispensable for sustaining preformed chromatin loops ( Mitchell andFraser , 2008 ; Palstraet al . , 2008 ) . Moreover , chromatin loop - ingisnotlimitedtoactivegenes . Forexample , uponrepressionof the Kit gene , loss of an enhancer - promoter loop is accompanied bydenovoloopformation withinthegenebody ( Jinget al . , 2008 ) . These studies indicate that chromatin loops are highly dynamic and occur at active and repressed genes but leave open the question as to whether these long - range interactions are a cause or consequence of dynamic changes in transcription initiation . The molecular mechanisms that establish and maintain chro - matin loops remain incompletely understood . Fundamental insights into these issues arose from studies of the mammalian b - globin locus , which is among the ﬁrst gene clusters at which long - range chromosomal interactions between a powerful distal enhancer , the locus control region ( LCR ) , and the target b - globin promoters were described ( Carter et al . , 2002 ; Tolhuis et al . , 2002 ) . Mechanistic studies deﬁned gene - speciﬁc transcription factors that establish LCR - b - globin interactions , including the hematopoietic - restricted factors GATA1 and its cofactor FOG1 ( Vakoc et al . , 2005 ) , KLF1 ( also known as EKLF ) ( Drissen et al . , 2004 ) , and the more broadly expressed protein Ldb1 ( Song et al . , 2007 ) . Functional disruption of any of these factors was associated with reduced LCR - b - globin interactions and dimin - ished b - globin transcription . However , physical interactions among all of these proteins have been reported ( Cantor and Orkin , 2002 ) , making it difﬁcult to distinguish whether they func - tion in linear or parallel pathways . Moreover , whether the loss of Cell 149 , 1233 – 1244 , June 8 , 2012 ª 2012 Elsevier Inc . 1233 looping underlies the loss of transcription or vice versa remains an open question in these studies . GATA1 is a DNA - binding protein essential for normal erythroid differentiation and b - globin gene expression ( Evans and Felsenfeld , 1989 ; Pevny et al . , 1991 ; Tsai et al . , 1989 ) . GATA elements are present at the b - globin promoter and LCR , suggesting that GATA1 and its cofactors are involved in the juxtaposition of these sites . Our understanding of the mecha - nisms of GATA1 function has been greatly aided by the use of the GATA1 null proerythroblast cell line G1E . Introduction of an estradiol - inducible version of GATA1 ( GATA1 - ER ) into these cells ( G1E - ER4 ) leads to an estradiol - dependent activation of b - globin gene transcription with concomitant LCR - b - globin looping ( Vakoc et al . , 2005 ) . The transcription cofactor Ldb1 ( also called NLI ) does not bind DNA directly but is recruited to E box elements or GATA elements via a multicomponent complex that includes TAL1 , LMO2 , E2A , and GATA1 . GATA1 and Ldb1 display a highly overlapping genomic occupancy pattern , but notably , Ldb1 association strongly favors sites at which GATA1 functions as a transcriptional activator , such as the b - globin locus ( Cheng et al . , 2009 ; Kassouf et al . , 2010 ; Soler et al . , 2010 ; Tripic et al . , 2009 ; Wu et al . , 2011 ) . Several observations suggest that Ldb1 might be a critical effector of GATA1’s looping function . First , knockdown of Ldb1 impairs LCR - b - globin looping ( Song et al . , 2007 ) . Second , the Drosophila homolog of Ldb1 , Chip , is required for long - range enhancer action ( Morcillo et al . , 1997 ) . Third , like GATA1 , Ldb1 co - occupies the b - globin promoter and LCR and might therefore function by physically linking the two ( Song et al . , 2007 ; Tripic et al . , 2009 ) . Fourth , Ldb1 can form homodimers and even higher - order oligomers ( Cross et al . , 2010 ; Jurata and Gill , 1997 ) , which might underlie its role in loop formation . Prior studies in prokaryotes ( for review , see Marenduzzo et al . , 2007 ) , as well as studies in eukaryotic cells using plasmid constructs , have succeeded in inﬂuencing gene expression through forced looping among regulatory elements ( Ameres et al . , 2005 ; Mahmoudi et al . , 2002 ; Nolis et al . , 2009 ; Petra - scheck et al . , 2005 ) . However , the use of plasmids with altered chromatin conﬁguration and the relatively short genomic distances might limit inferences with regard to long - range chro - matin interactions at native gene loci . Here , we devised a strategy to modulate chromatin looping at an endogenous locus in its native environment . This enabled us to address whether forced chromatin looping can activate transcription , to examine the hierarchy of transcriptional regula - tors in chromatin looping , and to deﬁne the ensuing molecular and functional consequences . For our studies , we used G1E erythroid cells because they lack transcription factor GATA1 and thus fail to establish an LCR - b - globin loop and transcribe b - globin . Ldb1 recruitment to the b - globin promoter is entirely GATA1 dependent , whereas substantial amounts of the TAL1 / Ldb1 complex remain associated with LCR in the absence of GATA1 ( Figure 1A and Figure S1 available online ) ( Tripic et al . , 2009 ) . Therefore , Ldb1 recruitment by GATA1 to the promoter might represent a critical rate - limiting step in juxtaposing the LCR with the promoter to form a loop required for transcription initiation ( Figure 1A ) . We tested this hypothesis by using a ZF tar - geting approach to tether Ldb1 to the b - globin promoter in G1E cells ( Figure 1A ) . Notably , promoter - bound ZF - Ldb1 was capable of inducing a chromatin loop in G1E cells to an extent similar to that achieved by GATA1 restoration . ZF - Ldb1 constructs completely restored RNA polymerase II ( Pol II ) recruitment and Pol II serine 5 phosphorylation ( Ser5ph ) and partially rescued b - globin transcription . Genetic experiments in erythroid cells lacking the LCR conﬁrmed that the ZF - Ldb1 proteins functioned via a long - range looping mechanism . These results reveal that forced juxtaposition of regulatory regions can activate transcription and establish Ldb1 as a critical rate - limiting effector of GATA1 during chromatin looping . RESULTS ZF - Mediated Targeting of Ldb1 to the Endogenous b - Globin Locus As a strategy to tether potential looping factors to the endoge - nous b - globin locus , we chose artiﬁcial ZF proteins because they have been used successfully to target preselected genomic sites in vivo ( for review , see Klug , 2010 ) . ZFs were synthesized to target the b - major globin promoter ( P - ZF ) and DNase1 hyper - sensitive site 2 ( HS2 ) of the LCR ( L - ZF ) ( Figure 1B ) , as these sites were previously found to be in close physical proximity ( Carter et al . , 2002 ; Tolhuis et al . , 2002 ) . Each aritiﬁcial ZF protein con - tained six ZF domains that were linked in tandem to target 18 base pairs of genomic sequence ( for review , see Klug , 2010 ) . Target sequences were chosen within the DNase I hypersensi - tive regions to facilitate access to the ZFs but avoid interference with known transcription factor binding sites ( Figure S1B ) . Binding of the ZFs to their designated DNA sequences was char - acterized by using a previously described ELISA - based assay ( data not shown ) ( Bartsevich et al . , 2003 ) . ZFs were fused to a hemagglutinin ( HA ) tag and a nuclear localization sequence ( NLS ) , and their chromatin binding proﬁles were examined by chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) following introduction into G1E cells ( Figures S1C and S1D ; data not shown ) . ZFs with suitable binding properties were fused to Ldb1 and intro - duced into a retroviral vector containing an internal ribosomal entry site ( IRES ) - green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) or IRES - yellow ﬂuorescent protein ( YFP ) cassette . Upon infection of G1E cells , populations of GFP / YFP - positive cells were puriﬁed by ﬂuores - cence - activated cell sorting ( FACS ) and subjected to anti - HA ChIP . We identiﬁed a P - ZF that strongly bound the b - globin promoter in G1E cells ( Figure S1C ) . Fusion of Ldb1 with P - ZF ( P - Ldb1 ) retained strong binding to the b - major globin promoter but was also detectable at low levels at multiple HSs of the LCR ( Figure 1 ) . In the absence of the Ldb1 moiety , this ZF bound to these LCR sites with lower efﬁciency ( Figure S1C ) , indicating that the association of P - Ldb1 with the LCR is in large part due to its interaction with endogenous Ldb1 complexes at the LCR ( Tripic et al . , 2009 ) . In addition , L - Ldb1 ( L - ZF fused to Ldb1 ) was found to bind to HS2 , but not to the b - globin promoter ( Fig - ure 1C ) , which is consistent with the lack of endogenous Ldb1 complexes in the absence of GATA1 ( Figure S1A ) . Finally , cells coexpressing L - Ldb1 and P - Ldb1 produced comparable ChIP signals at the LCR and b - major promoter ( Figure 1D ) . It is noteworthy that ChIP results assessing several ZF proteins in erythroblasts or ﬁbroblasts ( data not shown ) revealed that the 1234 Cell 149 , 1233 – 1244 , June 8 , 2012 ª 2012 Elsevier Inc . binding properties of ZFs to naked DNA sequences in vitro do not fully predict their binding efﬁciency in vivo . Nevertheless , we were able to identify a ZF pair capable of targeting Ldb1 to the b - globin locus . Tethering Ldb1 to the b - Globin Locus Activates Transcription in the Absence of GATA1 LCR promoter looping is required for high - level globin gene expression throughout erythroid development . Therefore , we examined whether promoter - and / or LCR - tethered Ldb1 induces b - globin transcription in G1E cells . Because G1E cells lack GATA1 , the b - globin promoter is devoid of Ldb1 , whereas the LCR retains signiﬁcant amounts of Ldb1 mediated by the TAL1 complex bound to E box elements ( Figures 1A and S1A ) . Remarkably , expression of P - Ldb1 activated b - globin transcrip - tion over 1 , 000 - fold ( Figure 2A ) , amounting to (cid:1) 20 % of that achieved upon restoration of GATA1 ( G1E - ER4 cells ) ( Figure 2B ) . L - Ldb1 alone or ZFs without the Ldb1 moiety displayed little activity ( Figure 2A ) .

Because high - level b - globin expression requires the LCR ( Bender et al . , 2000 ) , these results suggest that promoter - bound Ldb1 is sufﬁcient to promote long - range contacts with the LCR , presumably via endogenous Ldb1 , to activate transcription ( see below ) . Measurements of b - globin expression were conﬁrmed with multiple primer pairs directed against the b - globin transcript ( Figure S2A ) . Moreover , the effects of ZF - Ldb1 expression were gene speciﬁc and not simply a consequence of a general differentiation induction because the expression of several additional GATA1 - activated ( Klf1 , Eraf , and b h1 ) and repressed ( Gata2 and Kit ) genes was unchanged ( Figure 2C ; data not shown ) . The potent activation by ZF - Ldb1 fusion proteins of b - globin transcription is particu - larly remarkable because it occurred in the absence of GATA1 , which is essential for b - globin transcription . The substantial b - globin transcriptional activation by ZF - Ldb1 stronglyimplicatesanLCRloopingmechanismbecause b - globin transcription is reduced to (cid:1) 1 % of normal when the LCR is deleted ( Bender et al . , 2000 ) . Moreover , Ldb1 occupancy at the b - globin promoter is normal in the absence of the LCR ( Song et al . , 2010 ) , indicating that promoter - bound Ldb1 alone is insuf - ﬁcient for b - globin transcription without the LCR . Although b - globin activation by ZF - Ldb1 fusion proteins was substantial , their effects did not match those of GATA1 , which is consistent with GATA1 exerting functions in addition to chromatin looping . Tethering of the Ldb1 Self - Association Domain Is Sufﬁcient for b - Globin Activation Ldb1 contains an N - terminal self - association ( SA ) domain that mediates the assembly of higher - order molecular complexes and might account for its looping function ( Cross et al . , 2010 ; Xu et al . , 2003 ) . Ldb1 also contains a C - terminal LIM interaction domain ( LID ) that confers binding to LMO2 and its associated GATA1 / TAL1 / E2A multiprotein complex . To examine whether the SA domain is sufﬁcient for transcription activation , it was fused with L - ZF and P - ZF and introduced into G1E cells . P - SA and L - SA showed very similar genomic binding proﬁles as the full - length Ldb1 fusion constructs , such that L - SA occupied HS2 , whereas P - SA bound the b - major globin promoter and , additionally , the LCR ( Figure S2B ) .

P - SA alone or coexpression of L - SA and P - SA activated b - globin gene transcription to virtually the same level as did the full - length Ldb1 fusion proteins ( Figures 2D and S2C ) . Again , the effects of ZF - SA were gene speciﬁc and did not globally alter erythroid gene expression ( Figure S2C ) . These results suggest that the Ldb1 self - association domain is sufﬁcient to induce b - globin transcription , further supporting the idea that forced juxtaposi - tion between the LCR and b - globin promoter underlies transcrip - tional activation . We also considered the possibility that the remaining portions of Ldb1 might participate in chromatin looping by nucleating higher - order protein complexes . To this end , we generated a ZF - Ldb1 fusion protein lacking the SA domain ( P - D SA ) but left the nuclear localization sequence and LID domain intact . P - D SA was capable of inducing b - globin transcription , albeit to a signiﬁcantly lower degree than P - SA ( Figure S2D ) . Activation never exceeded 50 % of that observed with P - SA , even under the most optimal conditions and expression levels ( Figure S2D ; data not shown ) . This supports the idea that the SA domain is most efﬁcient in nucleating higher - order complexes required for looping . Nevertheless , these results are also consistent with the possibility that Ldb1 can engage its partner proteins via distinct domains to produce chromatin loops . Tethering of the Ldb1 Self - Association Domain Induces LCR - Promoter Looping The strong induction of b - globin transcription by ZF - Ldb1 or ZF - SA implicates an involvement of the LCR and , hence , chromatin looping , because in the absence of the LCR , b - globin transcrip - tion is very low ( Bender et al . , 2000 ) . Therefore , we examined by 3C assay whether expression of ZF - SA constructs juxtaposed the LCR with the b - globin gene to form a chromatin loop ( Fig - ure S3 ) . Using HS2 as the anchor region , we found that , in parental G1E cells , the 3C signals generally declined with increasing distance ( Figure 3A ) , which is consistent with our previous observations ( Vakoc et al . , 2005 ) . In particular , there is no interaction between HS2 and the b - globin genes . Upon GATA1 restoration , the relative proximity of HS2 , with two adja - cent fragments comprising the b - major globin gene , signiﬁcantly increased ( Figure 3A ) . HS2 interactions with intervening or down - stream segments remained low , indicative of a GATA1 - depen - dent HS2 - b - globin chromatin loop ( Vakoc et al . , 2005 ) . We next determined the chromatin conformation of the b - globin locus in G1E cells expressing ZF - SA proteins . Strikingly , expression of P - SA alone , but not L - SA , produced a strong HS2 - b - globin chro - matin loop , recapitulating the chromatin conformation induced by GATA1 ( Figures 3B and 3C ) . Thus , recruitment of the SA domain to the b - globin promoter is sufﬁcient for juxtaposition with the LCR , likely via interaction with endogenous LCR - bound Ldb1 ( Figures S1A and S2B , model in Figure 1A ) .

Given the lower levels of occupancy of P - SA at HS2 in comparison to L - SA , it was surprising to ﬁnd that P - SA was as active as the combination of L - SA plus P - SA or GATA1 . It is possible that the ChIP signal for P - SA at the LCR underrepresents the amounts of P - SA because proteins indirectly associated with DNA are not crosslinked as efﬁciently . Moreover , P - SA associa - tion with multiple regions in the LCR via endogenous Ldb1 likely adds to its ability to promote loop formation . Nevertheless , forced LCR - b - globin chromatin looping correlated well with acti - vation of b - globin transcription . In concert , these results show that tethering the SA domain of Ldb1 to the b - globin promoter is sufﬁcient to produce an LCR - b - globin chromatin loop that is similar , if not identical , to that generated by GATA1 . This strongly suggests that Ldb1 is an essential rate - limiting effector of GATA1 during chromatin looping . More generally , juxtaposition of an LCR with a promoter causes strong gene activation . ZF - SA Expression Produces LCR - Dependent Functions Two of the key functions of the b - globin LCR are the recruitment of Pol II to the b - globin promoter and the stimulation of Pol II phosphorylation at serine 5 of its C - terminal domain , a modiﬁca - tion associated with early transcription elongation ( Sawado et al . , 2003 ) . Hence , if ZF - SA proteins activate b - globin transcrip - tion by promoting LCR - b - globin contacts , they are expected to stimulate Pol II recruitment and Ser5ph . To examine the extent to which ZF - SA fusion proteins restored LCR - dependent func - tions , we performed ChIP with antibodies against Pol II Ser5ph or with antibodies that react with Pol II regardless of its phos - phorylation state . Notably , expression of P - SA triggered Pol II recruitment to the b - globin promoter with an efﬁciency similar to that achieved by GATA1 expression ( Figures 4A and 4B ) . In contrast , Pol II levels in the body of the gene amounted to (cid:1) 25 % – 30 % of those found in GATA1 - expressing cells , corre - sponding well with the levels of b - globin mRNA production ( Fig - ure 2B ) . This is consistent with reduced recruitment of the elon - gation complex P - TEFb to the b - globin promoter and the body of the gene when compared to GATA1 - expressing cells ( as measured by anti - CDK9 ChIP ; Figure S4A ) . The amounts of Pol II Ser5ph found at the b - globin gene in P - SA - expressing cells were indistinguishable from those observed in GATA1 - express - ing cells ( Figure 4C ) . As an additional measure of transcription , we determined the level of histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation ( H3K4me3 ) and found that P - SA restored this mark to levels equal to that produced by GATA1 ( Figure S4B ) . Similar results were obtained in cells coexpressing P - SA and L - SA ( data not shown ) . These results demonstrate that two functions of the LCR , i . e . , Pol II recruitment to the b - globin promoter and Pol II Ser5ph , were completely restored by expression of P - SA , lending additional support to the idea that juxtaposition of the LCR with the b - globin promoter underlies the activity of P - SA . The failure to fully restore transcription elongation can be ex - plained by the lack of GATA1 and its cofactors that exert addi - tional looping - independent functions , possibly including the recruitment and activation of P - TEFb complex ( Bottardi et al . , 2011 ; Elagib et al . , 2008 ; see Discussion ) . Precocious Induction of b - Globin Transcription by ZF - SA Fusion Proteins in Primary Erythroblasts We examined whether ZF fusion proteins function in primary erythroid progenitor cells to activate b - globin expression . The maturation stage of primary erythroid progenitor cells from E13 . 5 wild - type ( WT ) fetal livers was monitored by ﬂow cytome - try measuring the expression of the cell surface markers Ter119 and CD71 ( Zhang et al . , 2003 ) . Cells progress through the R1 , R2 , R3 , and R4 stages of maturation ( Figure 5A ) and ultimately produce abundant amounts of b - globin ( Figure S5A ) . For the expression of ZF - SA proteins , we puriﬁed Ter119 (cid:3) and CD71 (cid:3) / low cells ( R1 population in Figure 5A ) representing early precursor cells . At this stage , the b - globin genes are not yet highly active , but cells express low levels of essential regulatory factors , including GATA1 and KLF1 ( Figure S5B ) . Following infection with retrovirus - expressing ZF - SA fusion proteins , cells were cultured in deﬁned medium containing cyto - kines IL - 3 , IL - 6 , and SCF to preserve the cells in the precursor state . Remarkably , expression of P - SA only or P - SA / L - SA , but not L - SA alone , precociously activated b - globin transcription ( Figure 5B ) .

Nonetheless , these results in essence mirrored those from G1E cells in that the same combinations of ZF fusion proteins were capable of acti - vating b - globin expression . The effects were speciﬁc to the b - globin locus , as no other erythroid genes examined were altered in their activities ( Figure 5B ) . Moreover , ZF - SA expres - sion did not nonspeciﬁcally promote erythroid maturation , as determined by ﬂow cytometry using CD71 and Ter119 surface markers ( Figure S5C ) . Together , these results show that ZF - SA fusion constructs can activate b - globin transcription in primary erythroid cells . ZF - SA Fusion Protein Induction of b - Globin Transcription Is LCR Dependent Targeting of the SA domain to the b - globin locus restores juxta - position of HS2 with the b - globin gene , Pol II recruitment , and Pol II Ser5ph , strongly suggesting that transcriptional activation is due to LCR - b - globin looping . The prediction from these obser - vations is that alleles lacking the LCR would not respond to ZF - SA fusion proteins ( Figure 6A ) . Alternatively , if b - globin tran - scription simply resulted from SA - induced transcription factor assembly at the b - globin promoter , then ZF - SA should activate transcription independently of the LCR . This distinction is espe - cially important in light of the positive effects on b - globin tran - scription exerted by the expression of P - SA alone . To deﬁnitively distinguish between these possibilities , we examined ZF - SA’s functions in E13 . 5 fetal liver erythroblasts derived from mice that are heterozygous for a deletion of the LCR ( D LCR / + ) ( Bender et al . , 2000 ) . The b - major gene on the D LCR allele is of the D haplotype , whereas that on the WT allele is of the S haplotype . We developed an allele - speciﬁc qPCR assay that distinguishes single nucleotide polymorphisms between the transcripts of these alleles ( Figure S6 ) , providing an ideal internally controlled experimental setup . Next , we transduced D LCR / + R1 cells with viral vectors ex - pressing ZF - SA proteins and exposed them to erythropoietin for 6 hr to promote erythroid maturation . Allele - speciﬁc RT - qPCR demonstrated that the WT allele ( b maj - S ) was activated in cells expressing L - SA together with P - SA or P - SA alone ( Fig - ure 6B , left ) . L - SA had little or no activity similar to ZFs lacking SA that served as negative controls . In striking contrast , the b - major gene on D LCR allele ( b maj - D ) was expressed at low levels and showed very little response to the P - SA / L - SA or P - SA proteins ( Figure 6B , middle ) . The effects of ZF fusion protein expression were essentially the same in the presence or absence of erythro - poietin and were speciﬁc to the b - globin locus , as none of the other examined erythroid genes were altered in their activities ( Figure S7 ) . The residual signal produced by the D - allele - speciﬁc primers was not due to transcription from the D allele but was due to the result of cross - hybridization with S allele cDNA .

Cell 149 , 1233 – 1244 , June 8 , 2012 ª 2012 Elsevier Inc . 1239 was demonstrated by template mixing experiments showing that (cid:1) 10 % of the signal produced by the D - allele - speciﬁc primers derived from cross - reactivity with the S allele cDNA ( Figure S6 ) . Indeed , when homozygous ( D LCR / D LCR ) R1 cells were trans - duced with P - SA , b - globin activation was close to background , establishing that the low signal obtained with D - speciﬁc primers in D LCR / WT cells was in fact due to cross - hybridization ( Fig - ure 6B , right ) . In concert , the results clearly demonstrate that the activity of ZF - SA proteins is entirely dependent on the pres - ence of LCR and hence on long - range chromatin looping . DISCUSSION Here , we employed a ZF targeting strategy to address critical questions concerning the higher - order organization of the chro - matin ﬁber . Targeting the SA domain of Ldb1 to the endogenous b - globin locus compensated to a signiﬁcant extent for the loss of GATA1 , strongly suggesting that Ldb1 serves as an effector of GATA1 during chromatin loop formation . Forced chromatin looping by ZF - SA proteins at a native gene locus caused con - siderable transcriptional activation , indicating that the juxtaposi - tion of an enhancer with a promoter causally underlies gene induction . Expression of P - SA by itself produced effects very similar to those of P - SA and L - SA coexpression . Several independent lines of investigation demonstrate that , in P - SA - expressing cells , forced loop formation accounts for b - globin activation . First , 3C experiments clearly showed that tethering the SA domain to the b - globin promoter fostered genomic contacts that strongly resembled those induced by GATA1 with regard to both their spatial conﬁguration and efﬁciency . Second , SA domain recruit - ment completely restored several LCR - dependent functions at the b - globin promoter , including Pol II recruitment , Ser5ph of Pol II , and H3K4 methylation . Third , targeted deletion of the LCR dramatically reduced b - globin transcription without dimin - ishing the amounts of promoter - bound Ldb1 ( Song et al . , 2010 ) . Therefore , tethering Ldb1 or its SA domain to the promoter is not expected to produce such pronounced effects without an involvement of the LCR . Fourth , P - SA and P - SA / L - SA induction of b - globin expression was entirely dependent on the LCR , conﬁrming an underlying looping mechanism . The ability of P - SA to potently induce loop formation is most likely explained by its ability to interact with endogenous Ldb1 - con - taining complexes that reside at the LCR even in the absence of GATA1 ( Figure S1A ) ( Tripic et al . , 2009 ) . In contradistinction , Ldb1 association with the b - globin promoter is entirely GATA1 dependent and hence might represent a critical and rate - limiting step during chromatin looping and high - level transcription . The observation that the SA domain is sufﬁcient to induce long - range chromatin interaction implies that SA of Ldb1 is a major molecular force tying together anchored chromatin regions . Importantly , the SA domain can form multimers ( Cross A B Figure 6 . LCR Dependence of b - Globin Induction by ZF - SA Proteins ( A ) Experimental concept . The LCR - deleted allele is on the background of the b - major D haplotype , whereas the WT allele is on the background of the b - major S haplotype .

Transcript levels were normalized to GAPDH . n = 3 . Error bars denote SD . See also Figures S6 and S7 . 1240 Cell 149 , 1233 – 1244 , June 8 , 2012 ª 2012 Elsevier Inc . et al . , 2010 ) , allowing for the formation of higher - order complexes that might serve to stabilize interactions between distant chromatin fragments . However , the SA - deleted form of Ldb1 was also active , suggesting that the LID domain is also capable , albeit with lower efﬁciency , of recruiting the endoge - nous Ldb1 complex to promote long - range interactions . Although it is conceivable that , in the simplest terms , the mere dimerization of DNA - bound factors should be capable of inducing chromatin loops , we speculate that multiple contacts are required to provide the requisite speciﬁcities and afﬁnities . Moreover , the folding of the chromatin ﬁber can occur in complex patterns involving simultaneous interactions between multiple segments to form what are called chromatin hubs . Simple protein dimers might be insufﬁcient to accommodate such complex interaction patterns . In agreement , fusion of ZFs with diverse dimerizering domains ( lexA , p65NFkB , and the Argent dimerization system ) or protein modules that can form multimers , such as the POZ domain of GAGA factor , failed to efﬁ - ciently activate b - globin expression ( W . D . , unpublished data ) . Thus , Ldb1 might have evolved to promote such interactions by forming homomultimers and by engaging numerous gene - speciﬁc transcription factors , including the LMO2 / TAL1 / E2A complex and GATA1 . Indeed , a widely used and evolutionarily conserved looping function for Ldb1 is suggested by studies in diverse organisms and cell lineages ( Matthews and Visvader , 2003 ; Morcillo et al . , 1997 ; Thaler et al . , 2002 ) . The cause - effect relationship between chromatin looping and gene regulation has been unclear . By manipulating the chro - matin conformation at a native gene locus , we found that juxta - position of an enhancer with its target gene leads to transcription activation , indicating that looping is a prerequisite for transcrip - tion activation . In particular , forced association between the LCR and the b - globin gene sufﬁced to exert two functions ascribed to the LCR , the formation of a preinitiation complex at the promoter and the generation of early elongating Pol II , as re - ﬂected in Ser5ph ( Sawado et al . , 2003 ; Song et al . , 2010 ) . On the other hand , our observation that ZF - Ldb1 proteins completely rescued chromatin looping but only partially restored transcrip - tion elongation agrees with the notion that full transcription is not required for loop formation ( Jing et al . , 2008 ; Mitchell and Fraser , 2008 ; Palstra et al . , 2008 ) . We speculate that juxtaposi - tion of the LCR with b - globin promoter increases the concentra - tion of nuclear regulators at the promoter above a threshold critical for preinitiation complex formation and early transcription elongation ( see model in Figure 7 ) . Ldb1 recruitment in GATA1 null cells completely rescued chromatin looping and transcription initiation but only partially restored transcription elongation , indicating that GATA1 contrib - utes additional functions independently of Ldb1 and chromatin looping . Indeed , both the recruitment of the P - TEFb complex and its distribution along the gene were impaired in the absence of GATA1 , suggesting GATA1 impacts on P - TEFb regulation at multiple levels , perhaps via direct interaction ( Bottardi et al . , 2011 ; Elagib et al . , 2008 ) or indirectly via proteins of the bromo - domain and extra terminal domain ( BET ) family ( Lamonica et al . , 2011 ) . In addition , GATA1 interacts with many other transcription factors and histone modiﬁers , the lack of which might account for inefﬁcient transcription elongation . Figure 7 . Hypothetical Model Functionally Integrating Chromatin Looping and Transcription Activation Recruitment of Ldb1 to the b - globin promoter either by ZF proteins or GATA1 promotes LCR promoter looping . Forced chromatin looping by ZF - Ldb1 efﬁciently restores preinitiation complex ( PIC ) assembly , Pol II recruitment , Pol II Ser5ph , and transcription initiation . In the absence of GATA1 , diminished recruitment of P - TEFbandlikelyadditionalGATA1cofactorsaccountforinefﬁcienttranscriptionelongation . Therefore , chromatin loopingcantriggertranscription initiationand can occur independently of full transcription elongation . Cell 149 , 1233 – 1244 , June 8 , 2012 ª 2012 Elsevier Inc . 1241 In concert , these results suggest that Ldb1 functions down - stream of GATA1 rather than in a parallel pathway and highlight the usefulness of this system to interrogate protein functions during distinct steps in the transcription cycle . In more general terms , this work illustrates a novel strategy to establish hierar - chical orders of transcription factor function . On the background of a transcription factor deﬁciency , forced tethering of a potential cofactor to a chosen gene can be employed to measure its contribution to deﬁned steps in the transcription cycle , such as loop formation , Pol II recruitment , Pol II phosphorylation , and productive transcription elongation . We believe that this approach is widely applicable for any nuclear factors that can be knocked down or knocked out . One key general ﬁnding of our study is that a single ZF - Ldb1 protein targeted to the b - globin promoter can induce a chromatin loop by interacting with endogenous LCR - bound factors . ZFs have previously been linked to activation domains to success - fully activate gene expression ( Klug , 2010 ) . However , the use of ZFs to promote interactions with a potent enhancer or LCR is expected to produce more pronounced transcriptional effects . Indeed , we are not aware of any single ZF proteins capable of activating gene transcription by a factor of more than 1 , 000 - fold . Another advantage of a forced looping approach by a single ZF construct , especially in the context of therapeutic applica - tions , is that efﬁcient expression of a single molecule is easier than coexpression of two factors at matching levels . Finally , speciﬁc chromatin loops can occur at repressed genes ( Jing et al . , 2008 ) , and placing an enhancer and promoter on separate loops can isolate the enhancer to render it inactive ( Ameres et al . , 2005 ; Hou et al . , 2008 ) . Thus , in addition to acti - vating transcription , we envision that forced chromatin looping could be used to silence gene expression for scientiﬁc or thera - peutic purposes . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Artiﬁcial ZF Design ZFs , each containing six Cys2 - His2 ZF domains and targeting 18 – 19 bp sites within either the b - major promoter or DNase1 hypersensitive site 2 of the mouse LCR , were designed and assembled from two - ﬁnger units as previ - ously described ( Bartsevich et al . , 2003 ) . Cell Culture G1EandG1E - ER4cellswereculturedasdescribed ( Weissetal . , 1997 ) . Where indicated , G1E - ER4 cells were treated with 100 nM estradiol ( E2 ) for 21 ( 3C assays ) or 24 hr ( RT - qPCR and ChIP assays ) to activate GATA1 - ER ( indicated as G1E + GATA1 in ﬁgures ) . Isolation of Primary Erythroblasts WT fetal liver erythroid cells were obtained from CD1 mice ( Charles River Laboratories ) . D LCR / D LCR mice ( 129 strain ) were described ( Bender et al . , 2000 ) . To generate D LCR / WT mice , D LCR / D LCR male animals were bred withWTfemalemice ( BL6strain ) .

The R1 ( Ter119 - and CD71 - / low ) populations were iso - lated , infected with desired retrovirus , and cultured for 24 hr in proliferation medium containing Iscove’s modiﬁed Dulbecco’s medium ( IMDM ) supple - mented with 15 % fetal bovine serum , 1 % penicillin - streptomycin , 1 % gluta - mine , 10 ng / ml mIL3 , 20 ng / ml m / h IL6 , 50 ng / ml mSCF , and 10 ng / ml m / h FLT3L from Peprotech . Where indicated , cells were induced to differentiate by culture in IMDM supplemented with 15 % fetal bovine serum , 1 % peni - cillin - streptomycin , 1 % glutamine , 50 ug / ml ascorbic acid , 200 ug / ml holo - transferrin ( Sigma ) , and 2 U / ml Erythropoietin ALFA ( Epogen ) . 3C Assay The3Cassaywasperformedasdescribed ( Jingetal . , 2008 ; Vakocetal . , 2005 ) with the following modiﬁcations . 1 3 10 7 cells were crosslinked with 1 . 5 % formaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min , followed by glycine quenching , cell lysis , BglII digestion , and T4 ligation . 3C ligation products were quantiﬁed in triplicates by quantitative TaqMan real - time PCR . Probes and primers were designed using Primer Express 2 . 0 software ( Applied Biosystems ) and tested by serial dilution and gel electrophoresis to ensure speciﬁc and linear ampliﬁ - cation ( Figures S3B and S3C ) . Digestion efﬁciencies were monitored by SybrGreen qPCR with primer pairs that amplify genomic regions containing or devoid of BglII digestion sites ( Figure S3D ) . A bacterial artiﬁcial chromo - some ( BAC ) containing the entire murine b - globin locus of 129 origin ( SourceBioscience , Clone BMQ433I10 ) was digested with BglII and relegated togeneraterandomligationproductsofBglIIfragments ( FigureS3A ) . TheDNA was serially diluted and used to generate a standard curve to which all 3C products were normalized . The 3C signals at the b - globin locus were further normalized to those from four intervening regions or , alternatively , that of a control locus ERCC3 , both producing similar results .
