Daly , Colleen M . Seifert and Richard Gonzalez , University of Michigan , Ann Arbor , MI , USA How do product designers create multiple concepts to consider ? To address this question , we combine evidence from four empirical studies of design process and outcomes , including award - winning products , multiple concepts for a project by an experienced industrial designer , and concept sets from 48 industrial and engineering designers for a single design problem . This compilation of over 3450 design process outcomes is analyzed to extract concept variations evident across design problems and solutions . The resulting set of patterns , in the form of 77 Design Heuristics , catalog how designers appear to introduce intentional variation into conceptual product designs . These heuristics provide ‘cognitive shortcuts’ that can help designers generate more , and more varied , candidate concepts to consider in the early phases of design . (cid:1) 2016 The Authors .

Keywords : creativity , conceptual design , design cognition , design tools , innovation H ow do designers successfully create novel product concepts ? One suggested approach is to ﬁrst generate a wide range of concepts to consider ( Cross , 1994 ; Liu , Bligh , & Chakrabarti , 2003 ) . This re - quires the ability to create a large number of concepts that diﬀer from each other so that the set of concepts covers the space of possible designs ( Gero , 1990 ; Goel & Pirolli , 1992 ; MacLean , Young , Bellotti , & Moran , 1991 ; Simon , 1981 ) . Logically , the idea generation process beneﬁts from considering as many diﬀerent concepts as possible ( Akin & Lin , 1995 ; Atman , Chimka , Bursic , & Nachtman , 1999 ; Brophy , 2001 ; Liu et al . , 2003 ) . However , gener - ating a diverse set of concepts can be challenging because designers tend to ﬁxate on speciﬁc design speciﬁcations , which leads them to generate more concepts with similar features ( Purcell & Gero , 1996 ; Sio , Kotovsky , & Cagan , 2015 ) . For example , Jansson and Smith ( 1991 ) observed designers replicating similar solutions to concepts provided as examples , and even including their ﬂaws . Across studies , designers appear to consider only a small set of related concepts when generating ideas ( Ball , Evans , & Dennis , 1994 ; Chrysikou & Weisberg , 2005 ; Dong & Sarkar , 2011 ; Linsey et al . , 2010 ; Corresponding author : Colleen M .

Purcell & Gero , 1996 ; Sio et al . , 2015 ; Smith , 1998 ; Viswanathan & Linsey , 2013 ; Youmans & Arciszewski , 2014 ) . A number of approaches for facilitating idea generation during the early phases of conceptual design have been proposed ( c . f . Clapham , 1997 ; Shah , Hernandez , & Smith , 2002 ; Smith , 1998 ) . One approach distills knowledge about speciﬁc designs into an intermediate - level knowledge base by construct - ing composites from multiple examples . In Alexander’s pattern language ( Alexander , Ishikawa , & Silverstein , 1977 ) , and Krippendorf’s design dis - courses ( 2005 ) , patterns common in successful design solutions are identiﬁed at a component level , linking the designer to a broad range of helpful guidance from past solutions in a reﬁned form ( Alexander et al . , 1977 ) . This composite knowledge about design has been referred to as heuristic knowledge ( Fu , Yang , & Wood , 2015 ) . Heuristics are described as ‘mental shortcuts’ that cap - ture cognitive strategies that may lead to solutions ( though not necessarily the best one ) ( Nisbett & Ross , 1980 ) , and are ubiquitous in human reasoning ( Goldstein et al . , 2001 ) . Heuristics capture important features of problem sit - uations and solutions that tend to reoccur in experiences ( Clancey , 1985 ) . In software design , Riel ( 1996 ) has described the heuristic approach as ‘speciﬁc experience - based guidelines’ that help developers make good decisions . Lawson ( 1979 ) observed architectural students solving puzzles through ‘trial and error’ heuristic approaches . Lawson ( 1980 ) concludes , ‘An examination of protocols obtained from such closely observed design sessions reveal that most designers adopt strategies which are heuristic in nature . Heuristic stra - tegies do not so much rely upon theoretical ﬁrst principles as on experience and rules of thumb’ ( p . 132 ) . When generating new concepts , designers appear at times to oﬀer intuitive responses derived from ‘large pools of experience’ ( Cross , 2011 , p . 10 ) to make a ‘best guess’ at a new design . Consider the example in Figure 1 , a desk chair that reclines to allow the user to lie beneath ( rather than in front of ) a computer screen . In comparing this novel design to prototypical chairs , it is evident that the designer changed the user’s direction of access . By moving the access point from in front of the screen to below it , an innovative design results . Further , this strategy , ‘change direction of access , ’ may be a useful heuristic to apply in generating designs for other products . For example , applying the ‘change direction of access’ heuristic to a trackball controller may suggest side rather than top access , and accommodate thumb control rather than palm move - ments ( see Figure 2 ) . Design heuristics like this one may help designers create more , and more diverse , concepts , thereby increasing the likelihood that an innovative concept will result . Understanding how cognitive processes can be stimulated to generate design ideas may lead to more eﬀective methods and tools to support conceptual design ( Jin & Benami , 2010 ) . 96 Design Studies Vol 46 No . C September 2016 In this paper , we examine evidence for design heuristics in the creation of mul - tiple design concepts . First , we summarize prior research where design heuris - tics were derived from evidence in the ﬁeld of product design , including approaches based on analysis of existing products and patents ( e . g . , Altshuller , 1984 ; Skiles et al . , 2006 ) . Next , we compile results across four research studies to identify a distinct set of heuristics evident in a diverse sam - ple of design solutions . These solutions include an analysis of award - winning products created by many diﬀerent designers . Uniquely , the present analysis examines design concepts from a professional designer working on a single design problem . In addition , two think - aloud protocol studies of industrial and engineering designers working on a novel design problem are included . These samples add value because they include multiple concepts generated for the same design problem . By considering alternative concepts , it is possible to observe how heuristics are used in the idea generation process , and how they facilitate exploring the space of concepts for a design problem . Compiling pat - terns observed across varied products , design tasks , and design processes , we identify a new set of 77 design heuristics . Each heuristic is presented with a written description and an example of its application in an existing consumer product . Finally , we discuss issues of the granularity of heuristic descriptions , and the use of heuristics as a concept generation tool for product designers . 1 Heuristics in product design How can we identify possible heuristics used in product design ? Heuristics are learned from experience within a domain , and tend to be implicit and diﬃcult to verbalize ( Nisbett & Ross , 1980 ) . The use of heuristics without conscious access has been documented in studies of experts including ﬁreﬁghters ( Klein , 1993 ) , scientists ( Baker & Dunbar , 2000 ) and designers ( Yilmaz & Seifert , 2011 ) . However , this tacit knowledge about how to create designs Figure 1 A design released by Altwork ( http : / / altwork . com ) positions the user under the workstation Design heuristics for idea generation 97 may be observable by comparing designers’ proposed solutions ( Matthews , Wallace , & Blessing , 2000 ; Yilmaz , Seifert , Daly , & Gonzalez , 2016 ) . Several existing heuristic approaches to idea generation have drawn conclusions based on empirical studies of product concepts ( Perez , Linsey , Tsenn , & Glier , 2011 ) and design patents ( Altshuller , 1984 ) . The theory of ‘inventive problem solving’ ( known as TIPS or TRIZ ) ( Altshuller , 1984 ) involved identifying heuristics from successful patents in en - gineering . The TRIZ analysis focuses on identifying technical contradictions in mechanical engineering designs . For example , Ogot & Okudan ( 2007 ) describe a design tradeoﬀ when ‘increasing the stiﬀness of an airplane’s wings to reduce vibration during ﬂight ( good ) increases the weight of the plane ( bad ) ’ ( p . 111 ) . Altshuller ( 1984 ) analyzed thousands of engineering patents and abstracted forty principles , and noted that certain contradictions lend them - selves to particular solutions . These were compiled into a contradiction matrix of system features ( e . g . , speed , weight , measurement accuracy ) crossed with typical undesired results to index relevant design principles ( Altshuller & Rodman , 1999 ; Altshuller , 1997 , 2005 ; Orloﬀ , 2003 ; Savransky , 2000 ) . How - ever , because TRIZ analysis requires the identiﬁcation of technical tradeoﬀs ﬁrst , it is most helpful for designs developed to the point of speciﬁc commit - ments to materials and mechanisms . Learning to use the TRIZ system requires extensive training , eﬀort and commitment ( Ilevbare , Probert , & Phaal , 2013 ) . The terminology and modeling methods are unique to TRIZ , and diﬀer from those found in engi - neering design ( Smith , 2003 ) . However , in a classroom study with ﬁrst - year en - gineering students , Ogot and Okudan ( 2007 ) trained teams of 4 students to use Figure 2 The original version of the Kensington Expert Mouse ( www . kensington . com ) used a center ball as a trackball , while the newer design by Logitech ( www . logitech . com ) positions the ball on the right side , under the thumb 98 Design Studies Vol 46 No . C September 2016 TRIZ to generate concepts while other teams used traditional idea generation methods . They found that teams using the TRIZ method produced more unique solutions compared to other teams , along with more feasible concepts . This was replicated in another engineering classroom study where the TRIZ method was found to result in more novelty compared to sketch methods . In a third classroom study , engineering students using TRIZ improved the novelty and variety of concepts generated ( Hernandez , Schmidt , & Okudan , 2013 ; Hernandez , Schmidt , Kremer , & Lin , 2014 ) . Finally , an experimental study with graduate student and professional engineer teams found that TRIZ improved the novelty of solutions with only a ten minute training ses - sion ( Chulvi , Gonzalez - Cruz , Mulet , & Aguilar - Zambrano , 2013 ) . Another approach to identifying design heuristics has examined existing prod - ucts that ‘transform , ’ or change into diﬀerent conﬁgurations or states for use ( Skiles et al . , 2006 ) . For example , a wooden chair may be designed to trans - form into a stepladder . Transformer products address each function set inde - pendently and at diﬀerent times , while moving smoothly between states as needed ( Weaver , Wood , Crawford , & Jensen , 2010 ) . Based on analyses of 85 past patents , 40 analogies from nature , and 100 existing multistate prod - ucts , three transformation design principles were extracted ( expand / collapse , expose / cover , and fuse / divide ) ( Singh et al . , 2007 , 2009 ; Skiles et al . , 2006 ; Weaver et al . , 2008 , 2010 ) . A fourth principle , reorientation , was proposed in a later study ( Haldaman & Parkinson , 2010 ) . In addition , twenty subordi - nate ‘facilitators’ were extracted to support these principles . Example facilita - tors include using ‘generic connections’ to allow diﬀerent modules to perform diﬀerent functions ; ‘segmentation , ’ or dividing a single contiguous part into two or more parts ; and ‘fold , ’ or create relative motion between parts or sur - faces by hinging , bending , or creasing . A study of engineering students found that encouraging the use of transformation principles and facilitators resulted in the generation of 25 % more concepts ( Weaver et al . , 2009 ) . Several other studies have analyzed product designs to derive heuristics for idea generation . One study examined 197 award - winning innovative products , and organized the identiﬁed design features into categories ( Saunders , Seepersad , & H € oltt € a - Otto , 2011 ) . The thirteen ‘innovation characteristics’ identiﬁed in this analysis include ‘additional function , ’ ‘modiﬁed size , ’ ‘expanded usage environment , ’ and ‘user interactions . ’ Another study identi - ﬁed ‘consumer variation’ heuristics for designing for user diﬀerences ( Cormier , Literman , & Lewis , 2011 ) . Through an analysis of 31 product lines with 645 product models , 20 heuristics are identiﬁed and categorized into func - tion , form , and information and control groups . Examples include , Utilize ( re ) conﬁgurability when the product architecture is speciﬁc to handedness , Use system ( re ) conﬁgurability facilitated by modules when desired functionality is decoupled , and Utilize materials which have built - in ﬂexibility for aesthetic modiﬁcation . Finally , a study of 46 bio - inspired products and systems resulted Design heuristics for idea generation 99 in six ‘scaling principles : ’ change energy source , simplify system , change method , combine functions , directly transfer components , and change parameters ( Perez et al . , 2011 ) . In these diﬀerent approaches , various design heuristics were identiﬁed based on the design evidence considered . These approaches diﬀer in the observed de - signs , with a focus on transforming ( dual function ) products in Weaver et al . ( 2010 ) , award - winning innovative products in Saunders et al . ( 2011 ) , con - sumer variation product lines in Cormier et al . ( 2011 ) , and products at varied scales ( in Perez et al . , 2011 ) . TRIZ ( Altshuller , 2005 ) stands out for the large number of patents analyzed . However , in all of these approaches , only a ﬁnal ‘winning’ concept is considered . The present study also includes a large sample of designs for award - winning consumer products . But uniquely , the present study adds samples of multiple candidate concepts generated by designers for a single design problem . The opportunity to observe the set of candidate concepts generated by a designer for a given problem provides a richer sample of variations among concepts than is captured by ﬁnal product designs . Obser - vations from a long - term design project by a very experienced designer added hundreds of concepts for a single design problem . The observation of idea gen - eration sessions ( rather than solely the ‘winning , ’ ﬁnal product ) provides more evidence about how designers introduce variations in their concept sets through what Lawson ( 2012 ) calls ‘knowing by doing . ’ By consolidating re - sults across four empirical studies of concept generation , with varied contexts and more concepts sampled , we hoped to detect a broad array of design heuristics . 2 Method For the present study , we compiled a larger database from four prior empirical studies ( described in Table 1 ) . The goal was to create a larger , rich dataset of design concepts from three diﬀerent contexts , multiple design problems and multiple designers . The four studies included diverse datasets : ( 1 ) award - winning products from a wide range of consumer domains , ( 2 ) an expert indus - trial designer’s sequential concept sketches from a two - year solo design proj - ect , and ( 3 ) a protocol study of engineering designers where student and practicing designers’ think - aloud protocols were recorded as they worked on a novel product design task . A fourth study ( 4 ) replicated the think - aloud pro - tocol study with industrial designers in order to compare concepts from the two design disciplines . The process for extracting a design heuristic from award - winning product was as follows : For observed design concepts , major elements and key features of each concept were analyzed for functionality , form , and user - interaction fea - tures . A content analysis of the needs , design criteria , functions , and the design solution was performed for each concept . Then , potential heuristics were 100 Design Studies Vol 46 No . C September 2016 hypothesized and design criteria for their application were identiﬁed . Other concepts in the dataset with the same design features were compared in order to explore commonalities in candidate heuristics . Finally , a heuristic would be deﬁned at a level of generality that applied to multiple products , but was still speciﬁc to the observed design solution . For example , one heuristic was described as the ‘hollowing out’ of material , such as a brush handle with its mass reduced by using a hollow cylinder for a handle . This kept the heuristic’s description as close as possible to the observed concepts ; for example , diﬀerent heuristics captured reducing material through ﬂattening or folding . This extraction approach catalogs more speciﬁc innovations while ensuring the heuristics are general enough to ﬁt several diﬀerent observed concepts . Singh and colleagues ( 2009 ) describe a similar extraction method in their anal - ysis of transforming products . The product images in Figure 3 illustrate the process of extracting a heuristic from two of the 400 award - winning products included in the study . The ﬁrst image shows a new product e a paint roller e where a commonly used mech - anism in ballpoint pens ( the ink storage and roller ) is applied in a new context to solve the problem of delivering wall paint touchups . This heuristic also ap - pears in the second image as a brush repurposed as a desk organizer design . The heuristics extracted identify independent components of the design , and are not exhaustive , such that other features of these designs might serve to identify other possible heuristics . In the ﬁrst image , a second heuristic is also observable ; namely , Synthesize Functions , where both paint storage and appli - cator are combined in the design . In this way , observed concepts sometimes provided evidence of multiple heuristics .

Design heuristics for idea generation 101 This extraction method for identifying design heuristics in existing products was applied to the design concepts in the remaining three studies ( Daly , Christian , Yilmaz , Seifert , & Gonzalez , 2012 ; Daly , Yilmaz , Christian , Seifert , & Gonzalez , 2012 ; Yilmaz & Seifert , 2011 ; Yilmaz , Seifert et al . , 2016 ) . Study 2 provided 218 concepts created by a single , very experienced in - dustrial designer over a two - year period ( Yilmaz & Seifert , 2011 ) . The design problem was to create a universal access bathroom to be installed in private homes . The designer worked on a large paper scroll to preserve his concepts as they were created . By examining sequential concepts , transitions between candidate concepts were evident . Across this set of designs , we observed that the same speciﬁc heuristics appeared repeatedly in this designer’s work . For example , one heuristic addressed a change in how the functions of the product were controlled . In this example concept , the designer arranged com - ponents around the same central structure ( a plumbing tube ) ( see Figure 4 ) . This strategy was then observed in other designs , leading to a proposed heu - ristic , Align components around the center . This concept also suggests other heuristics , allowing the user to reorient the product according to their height , and repeat design elements . The concepts collected from Studies 3 and 4 involved a ‘think aloud’ protocol ( Dorst & Cross , 2001 ; Ericsson & Simon , 1993 ) of engineering and industrial designers’ process while creating solutions for a novel product problem ( the design of a solar oven for use in an outdoor setting ) . Forty - eight designers generated 247 diﬀerent concepts for this single design problem . For example , one of the designers generated a concept for a portable backpack container that allowed cooking using sunlight ( see Figure 5 ) .

On the right , a desk organizer for pens and cards makes use of brush bristles to catch and hold these objects ( http : / / ideasmodern . com / ideas / playful - pencil - organizer - pratonzolo / ) 102 Design Studies Vol 46 No . C September 2016 Next , three independent coders with advanced degrees ( one with an M . F . A . in industrial design , one with a Ph . D . in engineering education , and one a senior student in mechanical engineering ) worked as a team to examine each concept in the collected database . The coders considered each concept both individu - ally and in its concept set sequence for evidence of heuristic use . The three coders worked collaboratively to reﬁne heuristic deﬁnitions , and all decisions about identiﬁed heuristics were argued to consensus . Because the coders worked as a team during the extensive analysis , no measure of reliability was possible . The collaborative identiﬁcation of heuristic use across these observed concepts occurred over a period of six weeks . 3 Results The analysis of this combined sample of 3457 products and design concepts across four empirical studies resulted in the observation of 77 distinct design heuristics . Each of the identiﬁed heuristics was observed in at least four diﬀerent concepts across the sample datasets . These heuristics addressed design goals such as adding functionality , using fewer resources , saving space , providing visual consistency , and forming new relationships among design el - ements . The 77 Design Heuristics are shown in Figure 6 . This set of 77 Design Heuristics includes only those necessary to account for the data in these four studies . Each Design Heuristic is described , and illustrated with a commercial product where the heuristic is evident .

An important feature of this compilation of heuristics across studies is that each heuristic was observed multiple times ( at least four ) in diﬀerent products and product concepts , and all were observed in solutions from more than one designer . The sole exception is expose interior , which was observed only one concept ( in Study 4 ) but included because it is well known ( e . g . , watches or clocks ) and may facilitate the goal of considering a variety of candidate concepts . Only seven heuristics were observed in just one of the four studies . The fre - quency of observation for each heuristic in the compiled dataset ranged from 4 to 274 , indicating high variation in frequency of use . Only 12 % of the observed instances of Design Heuristic use occurred in Study 1 ( product analysis ) , but over half of the Design Heuristics ( 39 ) were observed in that particular study . Across the four studies ( analyzed sequentially ) , the number of new heuristics identiﬁed decreased from 39 to 25 to 5 to 1 . Even though the design problem and setting changed with each study , a great number of Figure 5 A concept for a solar oven generated by a designer using an Attach product to user heuristic , along with an Add functions heuristic .

This suggests the identiﬁcation of heuristics had reached a point of saturation across the entire set of concepts in this compiled dataset . The data observed led to seventy heuristics across the four studies . Splitting seven observed heuristics into two separate heuristics subsequently created seven new heuristics . For example , Replace materials with recycled ones included both the use of recycled material and recyclable products . This heu - ristic was then redeﬁned into two : Use repurposed or recycled materials , and Make product recyclable . The intent in adding these seven heuristics was to provide clariﬁcation of their meaning given that two subcategories appeared evident in the concepts reviewed ( see Table 3 ) . Across the four studies , the majority ( 51 % ) of the design heuristic observa - tions occurred in Study 2 . This study analyzed designs from a single industrial Figure 6 ( continued ) .

While the product analysis uncovered 39 diﬀerent heuristics , this case study of a single designer showed evidence of 57 diﬀerent heuristics . This designer also used a subset of heuristics more frequently . For example , Change direction of access was used 211 times in these concepts , perhaps reﬂecting the challenge of designing universal access func - tions within a home bathroom . Other heuristics frequently observed in this study were Attach independent functional components , Make components attachable / detachable , and Contextualize ( envision how and where the product will be used ) . This suggests the designer and the problem may play a role in determining which heuristics are frequently employed during idea generation . 4 Discussion Across four empirical studies , 77 Design Heuristics were identiﬁed . These heu - ristics were observed in multiple concepts and studies , and across designers and design settings . These results show that examining designers’ concept sets during idea generation provides a rich source of information about how they introduce variation into concepts for a given problem . In comparison , an - alyses of existing or award winning products ( Cormier et al . , 2011 ; Haldaman & Parkinson , 2010 ; Perez & Linsey , 2011 ; Saunders et al . , 2011 ; Singh et al . , 2009 ; Skiles et al . , 2006 ; Weaver et al . , 2010 ; Yilmaz , Seifert et al . , 2016 ) and patents ( Altshuller , 2005 ) provide a single design concept for each design problem as observations . These observations may limit the opportunity to observe how designers create a concept set containing multiple , varied con - cepts to consider . In the combined studies presented here , the methodology added the collection of observations during the idea generation process . Observing the generation of multiple candidate concepts appears to give rise to heuristic patterns not evident when examining only ﬁnal designs . Through systematic observation of multiple concepts created by many designers in var - ied design problems , we can attain a deeper understanding of the role of design heuristics in idea generation . Of course , not all designers intentionally create a large set of candidate con - cepts for a given design problem . With expertise , and perhaps experience regarding when speciﬁc heuristics may prove useful , a more directed process may occur , where a designer can focus more quickly on promising concepts ( Cross , 2016 ) . Certainly , there is ample evidence that designers often consider only a small set of related concepts when generating ideas ( Ball et al . , 1994 ; Chrysikou & Weisberg , 2005 ; Dong & Sarkar , 2011 ; Linsey et al . , 2010 ; Purcell & Gero , 1996 ; Sio et al . , 2015 ; Smith , 1995 ; Viswanathan & Linsey , 2013 ; Youmans & Arciszewski , 2014 ) . This small set of concepts in idea gen - eration may also occur when designers ﬁxate on speciﬁc design features ( Jansson & Smith , 1991 ; Purcell & Gero , 1996 ; Sio et al . , 2015 ) . Logically , the idea generation process beneﬁts from considering as many diﬀerent con - cepts as possible ( Akin & Lin , 1995 ; Atman et al . , 1999 ; Brophy , 2001 ; Liu 116 Design Studies Vol 46 No . C September 2016 et al . , 2003 ) in order to cover the space of possible designs ( Gero , 1990 ; Goel & Pirolli , 1992 ; MacLean et al . , 1991 ; Simon , 1981 ) . To do so , the evidence from the combined studies here suggests the use of design heuristics . One open issue regarding design heuristic use is how to decide which heuristic to apply in any given design context . The data from existing design solutions collected in these studies suggests the heuristics are readily applicable across design problems . Other approaches , such as Design to Connect ( Bleuze , Cioccib , Detandb , & De Baetsc , 2014 ) , have tested whether organized cues for heuristic use are helpful . Their study found that including a set of ‘design drivers’ ( e . g . , usability , aesthetics , economy ) did not improve performance of designers ; instead , the student designers in their studies preferred an unstruc - tured use of their connection guidelines . In studies with Design Heuristics , providing a subset of heuristics to designers to be selected at random has pro - duced improved design outcomes ( Daly , Christian et al . , 2012 ; Daly , Yilmaz et al . , 2012 ) . In the open - ended idea generation process , less determinate methods like Design Heuristics may be preferable for creating alternative design concepts in the early phases of conceptual design . Another question is whether the set of 77 Design Heuristics represent a deﬁn - itive description , or whether more such heuristics may be uncovered in future research . In the present study , we analyzed concepts from 400 consumer prod - ucts , 218 designs by a professional industrial designer , and 247 concepts from 48 diﬀerent designers . This represents a large sample of design solutions across many diﬀerent types of products and designers . Across these studies , the iden - tiﬁcation of new heuristics slowed , so that it appeared the readily evident heu - ristics had been uncovered , with only one new heuristic observed in the last study . However , further research on identifying new heuristics may identify new heuristics when diﬀerent design problems are included , or when diﬀerent designers’ work is sampled . Because heuristics are based upon experiences , new design goals and contexts may give rise to innovation in heuristics as the ﬁeld of product design ( and designers’ experiences ) changes dynamically over time . In addition , the organization of these 77 Design Heuristics may be reﬁned under further research ( Design Heuristics , 2012 ) . Finally , the empirical data described here was speciﬁc to the domain of product design . Future research should examine other domains , such as service design , software programs , and chemical engineering , to determine how heuristics may diﬀer by domain . What is the ‘right’ level of heuristic deﬁnition ? Is it best to have few heuristics that capture more abstract similarities across designs , such as only three prin - ciples ( expand / collapse , expose / cover , and fuse / divide ) identiﬁed in transform - ing products ( Singh et al . , 2009 ) ? Having a few , more general heuristics makes learning and remembering them easier , but requires more eﬀort in deciding how to apply them within a new design problem . Alternatively , having more heuristics and conditions on their application , such as the 40 TRIZ principles Design heuristics for idea generation 117 and contradiction matrix ( Altshuller , 1997 , 2005 ) , may be easier to apply to speciﬁc problems . However , a system with more heuristics may be harder to learn and remember , and likely requires more training ( Ilevbare et al . , 2013 ) . Goel and Bhatta ( 2004 ) describe this issue of ‘granularity’ ( Fu et al . , 2015 ) as the problem of specifying generic relations ( independent of any speciﬁc design situation ) among abstract design elements . The speciﬁcity of an identiﬁed heu - ristic can be characterized at varied levels , from ‘very general’ ( abstracted away from observed examples ) to ‘very speciﬁc’ ( closely tied to the observed example ) . At the extreme , a complete example , as in case - based design ( Kolodner , 1993 , 1997 ) and analogical approaches ( Ball , Ormerod , & Morley , 2004 ; Bonnardel , 2000 ; Casakin , 2004 ; Christensen & Schunn , 2007 ; Helms et al . , 2009 ; Linsey , 2007 ; Linsey et al . , 2012 ; Perkins , 1997 ; Qian & Gero , 1996 ; Visser , 1996 ) provides speciﬁc information about implementation . However , application to new design problems requires the abstraction of heu - ristics with each use , costly in cognitive eﬀort . Case approaches also raise the problem of access , or ﬁnding relevant analogies given the present design prob - lem . This suggests a trade - oﬀ between heuristic speciﬁcity ( that aids applica - tion ) and generality ( that increases relevance ) that has consequences for the access and ease of heuristic application ( Gray et al . , 2016 ) . In the extraction of Design Heuristics , we propose a criterion of eﬃcacy for heuristics : The success of heuristic deﬁnitions can be assessed based on their eﬀectiveness in helping other designers create novel designs through their application during idea generation . Further research would then determine whether a candidate set of design heuristics captures design variations at a level useful in concept generation . The 77 Design Heuristics presented here oﬀer an intermediate level of description that facilitates implementing the heu - ristic in a new problem context . The needed information about how to create a new concept is readily available within the heuristic . Yet , many decisions must still be made about how to apply the heuristic in a given problem . This includes the possibility of reapplying the same heuristic to the same problem again to create a diﬀerent concept , as observed in Yilmaz and Seifert ( 2011 ) . The chal - lenges of organizing many heuristics during idea generation can be managed through an external representation of each heuristic and random selection among heuristics ; then , if more concepts are desired , more heuristics can be considered . It is possible that further research might identify cues that indicate when speciﬁc heuristics are most relevant for application in a problem . Whether it is better to have 10 principles , or 77 , or 1000 , depends on what de - signers ﬁnd helpful to their idea generation process . In future research , it is important to compare the 77 Design Heuristics to other proposed methods of idea generation in order to assess its eﬃcacy . Increas - ingly , studies are showing the advantages of speciﬁc idea generation methods , and suggesting which methods are more eﬀective in given design circumstances 118 Design Studies Vol 46 No . C September 2016 ( Hernandez et al . , 2013 ; Jensen , 2012 ; Jensen , Weaver , Wood , Linsey , & Wood , 2009 ; Ogot & Okudan , 2007 ; White , Wood , & Jensen , 2012 ) . Empirical studies can identify which approaches work well for speciﬁc types of design problems , design domains , and types of designers . In addition , it is important to establish the value of generating multiple candidate concepts for later selec - tion and implementation . The present ﬁndings provide evidence for a new tool to aid designers in the process of idea generation . In the past , the use of heu - ristics in idea generation likely depended solely upon the generalizations each designer was able to build from their own design experiences . The use of a shared , external tool like the 77 Design Heuristics may facilitate the creation of innovative concepts by even novice designers in the early stages of concep - tual design . 5 Conclusion Design heuristics oﬀer a conceptual bridge between more general design the - ories and individual design precedents often provided to learners . The empir - ical observations presented here combine data from four studies of many designers working on a wide variety of products and problems in order to iden - tify common patterns evident in their designs . The resulting identiﬁcation of 77 Design Heuristics provides a collection of strategies grounded in observed use in concepts , and demonstrated across design problems , multiple concepts , and designers . This empirical approach to deﬁning heuristic strategies is unique among the approaches in the ﬁeld because it includes protocols from designers where more than one concept is sampled . By examining the candidate designs generated in addition to complete designs in the form of products and patents , rich information about how designers successfully create alternative concepts becomes evident . The results provide a collection of Design Heuristics suitable for use as a tool to explore possible alternative concepts . Design Heuristics may enhance the idea generation process by providing multiple strategies to consider , increasing the likelihood of innovative solutions .
