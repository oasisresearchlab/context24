The event was attended by about 20 000 people ( politicians , members of the public and students from four public universities ) . At the event , pre - packaged food was provided by two caterers . The Petaling District Health Office received an initial notification of food poisoning involving attendees of the event from a hospital in Klang District . This report describes the outbreak investigation to identify cases , contaminated food items and the causative pathogen ( s ) , to determine associated risk factors and to describe the prevention and control measures taken by the District Health Office to manage the outbreak . METHODS Epidemiological investigation The case definition was any person who attended the mass gathering event in Petaling District , consumed the pre - packaged food and subsequently developed ab - dominal pain , diarrhoea , vomiting or other constitutional symptoms ( e . g . fever , nausea or dizziness ) on 6 October 2019 . Active case finding was conducted by interviewing attendees of the mass gathering on site . Passive case finding was encouraged by alerting all health facilities to report cases related to the outbreak . All cases identified a District Health Office of Petaling , Selangor , Ministry of Health Malaysia . Published : 10 February 2022 doi : 10 . 5365 / wpsar . 2022 . 13 . 1 . 860 Objective : On 6 October 2019 , Petaling District Health Office received notification of a possible foodborne outbreak involving a mass gathering event . This report presents the processes of diagnosis verification , case identification , determination of associated risk factors and commencement of control measures in managing the outbreak . Methods : Cases were defined as those who attended the mass gathering event on 6 October 2019 , consumed the pre - packaged food and subsequently developed vomiting , abdominal pain , diarrhoea or other symptoms ( e . g . fever , nausea and dizziness ) . Epidemiological , environmental and laboratory investigations were performed . Data were analysed using SPSS software ( version 24 . 0 ) . Results : A total of 169 cases were identified . The attack rate was 7 . 2 % , and cases ranged in age from 7 to 50 years , with a median of 20 years . A total of 156 ( 92 . 3 % ) cases had vomiting , 137 ( 81 . 1 % ) had abdominal pain and 83 ( 49 . 1 % ) had diarrhoea . Consuming nasi lemak at the mass gathering was found to be significantly associated with developing illness ( odds ratio : 9 . 90 , 95 % confidence interval : 6 . 46 – 15 . 16 ) . The samples from suspected food , food handlers and the environment were positive for Bacillus cereus , Staphylococcus aureus or coliforms . Discussion : The outbreak at this mass gathering was probably caused by food contaminated with B . cereus and S . aureus . To prevent future outbreaks , we recommend mass gathering events use certified catering services that have adequate food safety training .

Cases’ ages ranged from 7 to 50 years , with a median of 20 years . Of the total cases , 161 were detected through active case finding and eight through passive case finding . A total of 156 ( 92 . 3 % ) cases complained of vomiting , 137 ( 81 . 1 % ) had abdomi - nal pain , 83 ( 49 . 1 % ) had diarrhoea and 19 ( 11 . 2 % ) had fever ( Table 1 ) . All cases sought treatment ; 20 were ad - mitted to hospital , and the remaining cases were treated as outpatients . No deaths were reported . The epidemic curve suggested a point - source out - break , with a pattern showing a rapid increase , single peak and tapered decline in the number of cases ( Fig . 1 ) . Exposure time was about 07 : 00 on 6 October 2019 . The onset of the index case was at 08 : 30 , and the last case was at 18 : 30 . The incubation period ranged from 1 . 5 to 11 . 5 hours , with a median of 6 . 5 hours . Nasi lemak had the highest attack rate , at 89 . 6 % ( n = 169 ) . The odds of cases having consumed nasi lemak ( odds ratio [ OR ] : 9 . 90 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] : 6 . 46 – 15 . 16 ) at the mass gathering were significantly higher than the odds of cases having consumed bread ( OR : 0 . 024 , 95 % CI : 0 . 010 – 0 . 059 ) or rice with chicken ( OR : 0 . 19 , 95 % CI : 0 . 14 – 0 . 27 ) . Bottled water also had a high attack rate , at 80 . 8 % ( n = 160 ) , but this was probably due to the high overlap of cases who consumed both nasi lemak and bottled water . Environmental examination The overall cleanliness rating of facility A was 48 . 8 % . Hazard analysis found poor general cleanliness and hygiene , evidenced by a congested food preparation area and dirty flooring , food preparation surfaces and sink floor . Unsuitable , defective and dirty equipment , such as a dirty chiller with a suboptimal temperature ( 10 °C ) , were used during food preparation for the mass gath - ering . Additionally , the components of the nasi lemak , which included rice , sambal and boiled egg , were cooked using the same pot . were interviewed using a standardized food poisoning questionnaire . Data on sociodemographic characteristics , symptoms of food poisoning , onset of symptoms and food intake history during the event were gathered . Environmental investigation An environmental investigation was conducted at the two kitchen facilities involved in preparing the pre - packaged food for the mass gathering . The parameters inspected were environmental hygiene , flow of food preparation in - cluding ingredients and their sources , handling of leftover foods and equipment hygiene . Laboratory investigation Rectal swabs from cases were taken at random , and envi - ronmental samples were collected focusing on suspected food and equipment used during its preparation . Clinical samples were collected in labelled containers with Cary - Blair medium . Vomitus samples were collected in sterile containers . A 250 g sample of each leftover item of food or drink ( nasi lemak , bread , rice with chicken , and bottled water ) was collected in sterilized sampling bags . Swab samples of food handlers’ hands and kitchen utensils ( cutting boards , knives , rice cookers and food containers ) were collected using 3M quick swabs . All samples were sent to the National Public Health Laboratory within 24 hours of collection for culturing and sensitivity testing . Analytical epidemiological investigation An unmatched case – control study was conducted to identify and confirm the food items and risk factors contributing to the outbreak . Convenience sampling at a ratio of 1 : 0 . 3 was used , with 169 cases and 47 controls enrolled in the study . A case was defined as described above , while a control was defined as any asymptomatic individual who ate the food items provided during the event . Probability values were obtained using Fisher’s exact test . Data management Respondents’ identities were kept confidential . All data were collected , collated , verified and analysed using SPSS software ( version 24 . 0 ) .

None had attended a food handling training course or had been vac - cinated for typhoid . None had any acute gastroenteritis symptoms at the time of inspection . The preparation of the nasi lemak started 26 hours before consumption and the estimated holding time was up to 20 hours at room temperature . The overall general cleanliness and hygiene of facil - ity B were satisfactory , with a rating of 86 % . Several control measures were taken to contain and eliminate the outbreak . The caterers’ activities at the facilities were suspended temporarily under the legal provisions of Section 18 ( 1 ) ( d ) Infectious Disease Control Act 1988 , Malaysia ( CDC Act 1988 : Act 342 ) . This was to ensure that the caterers could take measures to com - ply with the requirements outlined under the Food and Hygiene Regulation and prevent further outbreaks from occurring before resuming their activities . The caterers and food handlers also underwent food handling and health education , and they were urged to attend a food handling training course and obtain typhoid vaccinations .

The laboratory findings also strengthened the evidence for B . cereus as the causative pathogen because the pathogen was found in samples from the food handlers , food and environment . Low bacterial load could explain the negative clinical samples and the mild symptoms exhibited by the cases . S . aureus is a Gram - positive , sphere - shaped bacteria that is part of the normal flora of human skin and mucous membranes . 7 Poor hygiene practices by food handlers can increase the possibility of transferring S . aureus to prepared food , 7 causing it to release entero - toxins that lead to the symptoms seen in this report . 8 The possibility of S . aureus causing the foodborne out - break was further strengthened by its presence in the tested sample of nasi lemak . Additionally , the prolonged holding time of more than 4 hours increased the multi - plication of the microorganisms leading to food poison - ing . 8 Poor food safety and hygiene practices have been established as a major factor in foodborne outbreaks in Malaysia and globally . 9 , 10 Regarding limitations , since food was only served after the mass gathering event was over , most partici - pants had left the event site before investigation of the foodborne outbreak began . Also , there was no official registry of event participants . This made it difficult to identify and interview participants , and explains the low number of participants in the study and the use of convenience sampling to identify controls . CONCLUSION This report highlights the processes undertaken to identify cases and causative pathogens of a foodborne outbreak at a mass gathering , and measures taken to avoid future outbreaks . This study showed that the out - break was preventable . Recommendations to prevent future outbreaks include that organizers of mass gather - ings engage with certified catering services only ( e . g . by using the Trust MyCatering initiative established by the Ministry of Health Malaysia , which provides certifica - tion to catering operators that comply with food safety requirements ) ; 11 that awareness campaigns , guidelines and policies be established to ensure that organizers of mass gatherings liaise with local health authorities to im - with the local health district authority before organizing future events , to ensure that preventive measures were taken , including inspection and sampling of food handling facilities . Laboratory results A total of 77 samples were taken . None of the 33 rectal swabs or the nine vomitus samples tested positive for microorganisms . All five food samples were positive for at least one microorganism , namely Bacillus cereus , Staphylococcus aureus or coliforms . Ten of the 22 en - vironmental samples , and three of the eight hand swabs from the food handlers , tested positive for B . cereus and coliforms . DISCUSSION The outbreak of food poisoning at this mass gathering was probably caused by B . cereus and S . aureus . This was consistent with the symptoms and incubation pe - riod reported , and was further supported by the labora - tory results from samples of suspected foods , kitchen equipment and food handlers , which isolated B . cereus and S . aureus . The combination of the ubiquitous nature of these organisms and their coexistence in food and the environment is a major concern for food safety . Ad - ditionally , S . aureus food poisoning resembles that of B . cereus in terms of symptoms and incubation period . 1 , 2 Also , synergism has been observed between S . aureus sphingomyelinase and B . cereus phosphatidylcholine hydrolase . 2 The most likely vehicle of the outbreak was the nasi lemak . The odds of its consumption in cases was 9 . 90 times that of controls , and this result was statistically significant . The other food items , despite being statisti - cally significant , yielded odds of less than 1 ( bread and rice with chicken ) , and the likely causative organisms are not commonly found in bottled water . B . cereus is a Gram - positive rod that grows well in both aerobic and anaerobic environments . It produces an emetic toxin leading to the symptoms seen in these cases . 3 , 4 Plant - based foods – particularly rice , pasta and noodles – are common reservoirs for B . cereus . 5 , 6 Rice is the main ingredient in nasi lemak , enhancing the likelihood of WPSAR Vol 13 , No 1 , 2022 | doi : 10 . 5365 / wpsar . 2022 . 13 . 1 . 860 https : / / ojs . wpro . who . int / 5 Mass gathering foodborne outbreak in Petaling District , Malaysia Rajakrishnan et al References 1 .
