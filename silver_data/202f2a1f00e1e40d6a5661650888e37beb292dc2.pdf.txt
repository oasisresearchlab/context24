But there could be undiagnosed cases due mainly to asymptomatic infections . Seroprevalence studies can better quantify underlying infection from SARS - CoV - 2 by identifying humoral antibodies against the virus . This study was the first to determine the prevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 infection in Malaysia ’ s general population , as well as the proportion of asymp - tomatic and undiagnosed infections . Methods : This cross - sectional seroprevalence study with a two - stage stratified ran - dom cluster sampling design included 5 , 131 representative community dwellers in Malaysia aged ≥ 1 year . Data collection lasted from 7 August to 11 October 2020 involving venous blood sampling and interviews for history of COVID - 19 symptoms and diagnosis . Previous SARS - CoV - 2 infection was defined as screened positive using the Wantai SARS - CoV - 2 Total Antibody enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay and confirmed positive using the GenScript SARS - CoV - 2 surrogate Virus Neutraliza - tion Test . We performed a complex sampling design analysis , calculating sample weights considering probabilities of selection , non - response rate and post - stratification weight . Results : The overall weighted prevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 infection was 0 . 49 % ( 95 % CI 0 . 28 – 0 . 85 ) ( N = 150 , 857 ) . Among the estimated population with past infection , around 84 . 1 % ( 95 % CI 58 . 84 – 95 . 12 ) ( N = 126 826 ) were asymptomatic , and 90 . 1 % ( 95 % CI 67 . 06 – 97 . 58 ) ( N = 135 866 ) were undiagnosed . Conclusions : Our study revealed a low pre - variant and pre - vaccination seropreva - lence of SARS - CoV - 2 infection in Malaysia up to mid - October 2020 , with a consider - able proportion of asymptomatic and undiagnosed cases . This led to subsequent adoption of SARS - CoV - 2 antigen rapid test kits to increase case detection rate and to reduce time to results and infection control measures .

By then , 118 , 319 confirmed cases and 4 , 292 deaths had been attributed to COVID - 19 globally . 2 In Malaysia , the first imported cases were detected in January 2020 , 3 and the first local transmission occurred in February 2020 . 1 Together with a few imported cases , these constituted the first wave of the COVID - 19 pandemic in this Southeast Asian nation with more than 30 million population . 4 , 5 The second wave of infection started in March 2020 , prompting the government to implement strict public health measures such as mandatory face masking and physical distancing , and even a nationwide movement control order ( MCO ) that restricted interna - tional and most local travels , which successfully flattened the curve in early June 2020 . Throughout the ensued recovery MCO when all local travels were permitted again , the number of daily reported COVID - 19 cases remained relatively low . 4 Up until the third wave began in mid - October 2020 , the all - time cumulative cases were only around 15 , 000 . 4 , 6 This count included only cases with laboratory confirmation of infection by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) , which in turn was performed largely on suspicious cases with respiratory infection and relevant travel history or close contact with a confirmed case . 1 This is understandable at the initial stage of the COVID - 19 pandemic , when the disease was not yet known to present asymptomatic or with diverse symptoms . 7 , 8 Coupled these with the lack of diagnostic resources and barriers to access healthcare , the incidence figure could be underestimated due to undiagnosed cases , whether symptomatic or asymptomatic . 7 – 10 SARS - CoV - 2 infection leaves a serological trace in the infected person ’ s body . The presence of binding antibodies towards the receptor - binding domain ( RBD ) of the virus indicates past infection , whereas their ability to neutralise the virus indicates that the immu - nity formed is likely protective . 11 A survey that examines the sero - prevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 early in the pandemic before the advent of vaccination , when only a relatively small proportion of the popula - tion had begun to encounter the wild - type virus for the first time , can provide a better understanding to its transmission . This proxy of past infection serves as an additional indicator of disease burden that could quantify the extent of COVID - 19 underreporting , inform policymakers of the effectiveness of existing public health measures and lead to the improvement of these measures for better disease prevention and control . 9 , 10 During the first year of the pandemic , up to mid - August 2020 , the reported seroprevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 infection varied widely globally in the range of 0 . 4 – 22 . 1 % due to epidemiological and study methodology variations , including the type of serology tests used , which differed in their accuracy . 10 Around the same time , the meta - analysed pooled SARS - CoV - 2 seroprevalence among the general pop - ulation in the Western Pacific Region was 1 . 7 % ( 95 % CI 0 . 0 – 5 . 0 ) . 12 In Malaysia , two studies conducted in health facilities located in the country ’ s most urbanised region around mid - 2020 reported zero SARS - CoV - 2 seroprevalence among healthcare workers and 0 . 4 % among patients with non - respiratory infections . 13 , 14 While these studies pointed to a low COVID - 19 burden in the urban areas of Malaysia during the first few months of the COVID - 19 pandemic , the situation among the general population across the whole nation remained unquantified . A nationally representative community - based SARS - CoV - 2 seroprevalence study was necessary to better inform COVID - 19 prevention and control in Malaysia . Fur - thermore , as the number of infected people continued to increase , a repeated seroprevalence study might be required , preferably with a more efficient diagnostic kit . This study aimed to determine the preva - lence of SARS - CoV - 2 infection and the proportion of asymptomatic and undiagnosed SARS - CoV - 2 infections in Malaysia and to deter - mine the diagnostic accuracy of a SARS - CoV - 2 antibody rapid diag - nostic test ( RTK ) for its potential application in repeated seroprevalence studies . 2 | METHODS 2 . 1 | Study design This study was part of the 2020 National Health and Morbidity Sur - vey ( NHMS ) . The NHMS is an annual cross - sectional survey con - ducted by the Institute for Public Health ( IPH ) , Ministry of Health , Malaysia . It surveys the nationwide general population on a different health - related topic each year using structured questionnaires and usually minimally invasive clinical measurement ( capillary blood sam - pling ) to inform health policymaking . In 2020 , the subject of interest was infectious diseases . The methods of NHMS 2020 have been described in detail else - where . 5 In brief , this survey was designed to represent non - institutionalised population in Malaysia , irrespective of citizenship . We used a two - stage stratified random cluster sampling design , with the primary stratum being states and territories in Malaysia ( target population size range = 181 , 859 – 6 , 239 , 037 ) , while the secondary stratum consisted of urban and rural areas within the primary stratum . We acquired from the Department of Statistics , Malaysia ( DOSM ) , the sampling frame that arbitrarily divided the country into > 90 , 000 areas called enumeration blocks ( EB ) , each containing 80 – 120 living quar - ters ( LQ ) or 500 – 600 non - institutionalised community - dwelling indi - viduals . EBs served as the primary sampling unit ( PSU ) , and LQs were 2 of 8 CHONG ET AL . the secondary sampling unit ( SSU ) . In total , we selected 113 EBs nationwide , with 83 in Peninsular Malaysia , 13 in Sabah and 17 in Sarawak . From each selected EB , 20 LQs were randomly chosen . For SARS - CoV - 2 seroprevalence specifically , we included all per - manent residents aged 1 year and above in the selected LQ . We excluded LQs that housed temporary occupants and individuals with contraindications to venipuncture . We expected an overall sample size of at least 5 , 000 participants to achieve an estimated SARS - CoV - 2 seroprevalence in Malaysia of 1 . 0 % with a precision of ±0 . 3 % at 95 % confidence . 5 , 15 2 . 2 | Field data collection To ensure standardisation and facilitate comparisons , we adapted the WHO UNITY COVID - 19 seroepidemiological study protocol by including all questions required to capture necessary variables for data sharing with the WHO . 9 Between 7 August and 11 October 2020 ( the window period between the second and third waves of the COVID - 19 pandemic in Malaysia ) , trained data collectors visited eligible participants and inter - viewed consented ( and assented for < 18 years ) ones face - to - face using mobile tablets with a structured questionnaire that captured exposure variables such as basic sociodemographic background , COVID - 19 epide - miology including previous COVID - 19 diagnosis , and history of COVID - 19 - like symptoms in the year 2020 . Subsequently , trained phlebotomists collected up to 5 ml of venous blood from each participant in a gel tube with clot activator . Using residual blood specimens from the syringe , phlebotomists performed the Wondfo One Step COVID - 19 ( SARS - CoV - 2 Antibody ) Test ( Guangzhou Wondfo Biotech , China ) , an immunochromato - graphic rapid test kit ( RTK ) according to the manufacturer ’ s instruc - tions , as described previously . 16 Within 15 – 20 min of the test , two independent interpreters read the results if the control line became visible , indicating that the test was valid . Each independently reported any visible test line as a positive result , indicating the presence of anti - SARS - CoV - 2 immunoglobulin M or G ( IgM / IgG ) , that is , a previ - ous infection , and vice versa . A third person participated in the inter - pretation process to resolve any discrepancies . After the venous blood specimens clotted , trained laboratory techni - cians spun them onsite using a portable centrifuge and chilled them immediately in a portable freezer at 2 – 8 (cid:3) C . This cold chain was main - tained and monitored with a digital temperature logger all through the transportation process until the specimens reached a virology laboratory in the Institute for Medical Research , Malaysia , where trained laboratory personnel aliquoted and stored them at (cid:4) 80 (cid:3) C until adequate samples were accumulated for subsequent serology tests . 2 . 3 | Laboratory tests and case definition of previous SARS - CoV - 2 infection 1 . Wantai SARS - CoV - 2 Total Antibody Enzyme - Linked Immunosor - bent Assay ( ELISA ) Trained laboratory technicians tested serum specimens collected from all participants using the Wantai SARS - CoV - 2 Total Antibody ELISA kit ( Beijing Wantai Biological Pharmacy Enterprise Co . , Ltd . , China ) ( sensitivity : 89 – 99 % , specificity : 99 – 100 % ) , according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions , as described elsewhere . 17 , 18 For any test to be valid , the absorbance values of all controls must be within acceptable limits , as per quality control . We then calculated the cut - off value ( COV ) by adding 0 . 16 to the average absorbance of three negative controls . In our study , we interpreted the ratio of the speci - men ’ s absorbance to COV as positive if ≥ 1 . 0 , indicating the presence of anti - SARS - CoV - 2 binding IgM / IgG ; negative if < 0 . 8 ; and borderline if ≥ 0 . 8 to < 1 . 0 . 17 We repeated all specimens with borderline results . 2 . SARS - CoV - 2 surrogate Virus Neutralization Test ( sVNT ) Kit We tested all specimens with borderline and positive ELISA results on cPass ™ SARS - CoV - 2 Neutralization Antibody Detection Kit ( Genscript Biotech , United States ) ( sensitivity : 99 % , specificity : 100 % ) in the laboratory , following the steps described elsewhere . 19 According to quality control , all controls must have an average optical density ( OD ) within acceptable limits . We calculated the percentage of neutralization / inhibition ( inhibition % ) for each specimen using a formula : ( 1 (cid:4) OD of a specimen / average OD of all negative con - trols ) (cid:5) 100 % . 19 In our study , we interpreted the inhibition % as posi - tive if ≥ 20 % , indicating the presence of anti - SARS - CoV - 2 neutralising antibodies , and negative if < 20 % . 19 2 . 4 | Variables definition The main dependent variable was the status of previous SARS - CoV - 2 infection according to laboratory tests . We defined a participant as a case of previous SARS - CoV - 2 infection if the participant tested posi - tive on ELISA first and then confirmed positive using the sVNT kit . 14 The second dependent variable was the status of previous SARS - CoV - 2 infection according to onsite RTK . Independent variables were age , sex , location ( urban or rural ) , his - tory of COVID - 19 diagnosis and history of COVID - 19 - like symptoms . Symptom status was defined as at least one self - reported COVID - 19 - like symptom since 1 January 2020 ( fever , sore throat , runny nose , cough , shortness of breath , chills , vomiting , nausea , diarrhoea , head - ache , muscle ache , loss of smell , loss of taste and fatigue ) . The diagno - sis status was self - reported using the screening question , ‘ Have you ever been diagnosed as a COVID - 19 patient ? ’ , which in turn followed the early definition of confirmed cases , that is , a positive RT - PCR . 2 . 5 | Data analysis We used a complex sampling design ( weighted analysis ) to ensure the representativeness of Malaysia ’ s general population in terms of age group , sex and location . We computed the seroprevalence point esti - mate and 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % CI ) , as confirmed by the CHONG ET AL . 3 of 8 laboratory tests in the general population and its subgroups , and com - pared different subgroups using the Rao - Scott adjusted chi - square test . Next , we stratified the positive cases according to their diagnosis and symptom status to compute the proportion point estimate and 95 % CI for each status . Lastly , using standard formulas , we computed the diagnostic accuracy of the RTK ( the index test ) ; that is , sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value ( PPV ) and negative predictive value ( NPV ) , as compared to the status of previous SARS - CoV - 2 infec - tion according to laboratory tests ( the reference standard ) . All data analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows ver - sion 25 ( IBM , USA ) ( detailed data analysis in the supporting information ) . 20 3 | RESULTS A total of 6 , 818 individuals were eligible for this study . Among them , 5 , 131 eventually provided viable specimens for laboratory tests , with a response rate of 75 . 3 % . Most participants aged ≥ 18 years ( 74 . 4 % ) , were female ( 52 . 3 % ) and lived in an urban setting ( 53 . 9 % ) . After applying complex sampling design analysis , the total estimated popu - lation in Malaysia represented by the 5 , 131 participants was 30 , 763 , 427 people ( Table 1 ) . The weighted seroprevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 infection in Malaysia between 7 August and 11 October 2020 was 0 . 49 % ( 95 % CI 0 . 28 – 0 . 85 ) ( n = 25 , N = 150 , 857 ) . The prevalence was significantly lower ( p = 0 . 003 ) among those aged < 18 years at 0 . 10 % ( 95 % CI 0 . 03 – 0 . 35 ) ( n = 3 , N = 8 , 264 ) , as compared to 0 . 63 % ( 95 % CI 0 . 36 – 1 . 11 ) ( n = 22 , N = 142 , 593 ) among those aged ≥ 18 years . There was no significant difference in the prevalence between males , 0 . 55 % ( 95 % CI 0 . 27 – 1 . 11 ) ( n = 13 , N = 88 , 484 ) , and females , 0 . 42 % ( 95 % CI 0 . 16 – 1 . 10 ) ( n = 12 , N = 62 , 373 ) , as well as between urban , 0 . 55 % ( 95 % CI 0 . 29 – 1 . 02 ) ( n = 16 , N = 129 , 958 ) , and rural dwellers , 0 . 29 % ( 95 % CI 0 . 14 – 0 . 60 ) ( n = 9 , N = 20 , 899 ) ( Table 2 ) . The weighted proportion of symptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 infection was 15 . 9 % ( 95 % CI 4 . 9 – 41 . 2 ) ( n = 8 , N = 24 , 031 ) , much lower than 84 . 1 % ( 95 % CI 58 . 8 – 95 . 1 ) ( n = 17 , N = 126 , 826 ) of asymptomatic infection . On the other hand , only 9 . 9 % ( 95 % CI 2 . 4 – 32 . 9 ) ( n = 5 , N = 14 , 992 ) of SARS - CoV - 2 infections were estimated to be previ - ously diagnosed , while an estimate of 90 . 1 % ( 95 % CI 67 . 1 – 97 . 6 ) ( n = 20 , N = 135 , 866 ) went undiagnosed ( Table 3 ) . Of the 5 , 131 individuals tested using laboratory tests , Wondfo RTK results were available for 5 , 118 . There were four positive RTK results , two of which were true positives . Of the 5 , 114 negative RTK results , the number of true negatives was 5 , 091 . The RTK had a sensitivity and specificity of 8 . 0 % ( 95 % CI 1 . 4 – 22 . 7 ) and 99 . 9 % ( 95 % CI 99 . 9 – 100 . 0 ) , and its positive and negative predictive values were 50 . 0 % ( 95 % CI 10 . 7 – 89 . 3 ) and 99 . 6 % ( 95 % CI 99 . 3 – 99 . 7 ) , respectively ( Table 4 ) . 4 | DISCUSSION We report a low overall pre - variant and pre - vaccination SARS - CoV - 2 seroprevalence ( 0 . 49 % ) between 7 August and 11 October 2020 in Malaysia . This seroprevalence was six times higher ( p = 0 . 003 ) in the population aged 18 years and above . No difference was found between the sexes and the level of urbanisation . A high proportion ( 84 . 1 – 90 . 1 % ) of previously infected individuals was asymptomatic and undiagnosed . On the other hand , the SARS - CoV - 2 antibody RTK had a low sensitivity of < 10 % and close to perfect specificity and NPV , whereas its PPV estimate was moderate but lacked precision . In the first year of the COVID - 19 pandemic , before the emergence of variants and mass vaccination , the seroprevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 infection varied widely between countries due mainly to differences in the timing of the study relative to the spread of COVID - 19 among countries . 10 As the spread of COVID - 19 can differ even within countries , provinces or communities , bias in participant selection would also overestimate or underestimate the overall seroprevalence . 10 On the other hand , serological tests used to detect anti - SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies also differ in their diagnostic accuracy , resulting in measurement bias . Less sensitive diagnostic tests , such as lateral flow RTK , detect fewer positives and yield lower seropreva - lence as compared to more sensitive laboratory - based tests , such as ELISA 10 , 21 , 22 However , more sensitive tests , in combination with a more stringent case definition of a previous infection , would also yield T A B L E 1 Sociodemographic characteristics of 5 , 131 study participants recruited from 7 August to 11 October 2020 and the estimated population in Malaysia they represented Socio - demographic characteristics Unweighted count of study participants , n ( % ) Estimated population in Malaysia a , N ( % ) Overall 5 , 131 ( 100 . 0 ) 30 , 763 , 427 ( 100 . 0 ) Age group 1 – 17 years 1 , 312 ( 25 . 6 ) 8 , 063 , 772 ( 26 . 2 ) ≥ 18 years 3 , 819 ( 74 . 4 ) 22 , 699 , 654 ( 73 . 8 ) Sex Male 2 , 450 ( 47 . 7 ) 15 , 948 , 188 ( 51 . 8 ) Female 2 , 681 ( 52 . 3 ) 14 , 815 , 239 ( 48 . 2 ) Location Urban 2 , 765 ( 53 . 9 ) 23 , 657 , 065 ( 76 . 8 ) Rural 2 , 366 ( 46 . 1 ) 7 , 106 , 362 ( 23 . 2 ) a Complex sampling design analysis was applied to calculate estimated population ( adjusted for design weight , non - response rate and post - stratification weight , which was adjusted based on the Malaysian population projections for 2020 ) .

CHONG ET AL . 5 of 8 a lower seroprevalence . 5 Hence , similar national level studies using probability sampling and laboratory - based diagnostics would be more comparable to our study . Only two countries neighbouring Malaysia reported such studies , namely , Thailand with a SARS - CoV - 2 seroprev - alence of 0 . 4 % ( 95 % CI 0 . 1 – 1 . 0 % ) and Indonesia - 20 . 5 % ( 95 % CI 19 . 7 – 21 . 3 % ) , both conducted later in mid - December 2020 . 23 At that point of time , two months had lapsed since the end of this study that coincided with the beginning of the third wave on the COVID - 19 epidemic curve in Malaysia . 4 The SARS - CoV - 2 seroprevalence in Malaysia in December 2020 would have been higher than our 0 . 49 % point estimate and likely situated between the estimates of these two neighbouring countries . The proportions of asymptomatic and undiagnosed SARS - CoV - 2 infections also differed among studies . Asymptomatic infec - tions ranged widely from 3 . 7 % to 87 . 5 % among confirmed COVID - 19 cases , according to a systematic review up to 4 February 2021 . 24 The main reasons for the heterogeneity could be variations in study design , such as the timing of symptom ascertainment and the study population , where repeated symptom ascertainment at a later time as opposed to only at the initial test , and studies among contacts only instead of the general population tended to report a lower proportion of asymptomatic infection . 25 Our study was con - ducted among the general population and , hence , a higher weighted proportion of asymptomatic infections . In addition , recall bias could have contributed to fewer reports of symptoms when assessed retrospectively in this study . Future studies using a pro - spective design with repeated symptom assessments may provide better estimates . In terms of the proportion of undiagnosed COVID - 19 cases , apart from the study population and the accuracy of serological tests used , the main reasons for heterogeneity across studies could be the funda - mental differences between countries and administrative entities in their definition of COVID - 19 cases and contacts , the aggressiveness of contact tracing , testing availability and strategy , and other factors that would affect the yield of case detection relative to actual infection . 26 – 30 On the day we concluded our blood collection , 11 October 2020 , Malaysia recorded 15 , 657 confirmed COVID - 19 cases . 6 This cumulative number of confirmed cases approximated our 14 , 992 point estimate of previously diagnosed COVID - 19 cases , pro - viding confidence to this estimate and also to the estimate and proportion of the undiagnosed cases . This led to subsequent adoption of a positive SARS - CoV - 2 antigen RTK result to the COVID - 19 case definition in Malaysia to increase case detection rate and reduce time to results and infection control measures . 31 Our evaluation of the SARS - CoV - 2 total antibody RTK found it to have 99 . 9 % specificity and 8 . 0 % sensitivity . Although this RTK did not produce false positives , it produced 92 false negatives and only detect 8 out of 100 previous infections . Comparatively , the sensitivity and specificity of other SARS - CoV - 2 total antibody RTKs ranged around 18 . 4 – 100 . 0 % and 80 . 6 – 100 . 0 % , respectively . 22 Although a direct comparison of diagnostic accuracy across different studies cannot be completed without assessing the underlying biases stemming from heterogeneity in different studies , 32 the low sensitivity of this particular RTK precludes its application in future seroprevalence studies . 22 Any COVID - 19 seroprevalence study using RTK should be based on a proper prior evaluation and adjusted for measurement bias to obtain a more accurate seroprevalence estimate . 27 , 33 This study was conducted in 2020 between the second and third waves of the COVID - 19 pandemic in Malaysia . 4 The SARS - CoV - 2 seroprevalence was low but significantly higher among adults , likely due to higher mobility . As a result of increased mobility and the emer - gence of more transmissible SARS - CoV - 2 variants , 4 subsequent epi - demic waves became many times larger in magnitude . On the other hand , Malaysia initiated its mass COVID - 19 vaccination programme at the end of February 2021 . 34 These developments would lead to a substantial increase in SARS - CoV - 2 seroprevalence since the end of our study , albeit antibody decay might slightly negate that . Repeated seroprevalence studies were initially deemed necessary by the policy makers to monitor the progress of pandemics and vaccination pro - grammes . However , in view of the risk of COVID - 19 transmission and the significantly higher price tag this representative community - based survey carried , and also the lack of a more efficient yet accurate anti - body RTK to reduce the cost , the IPH instead proposed and subse - quently conducted another SARS - CoV - 2 seroprevalence study in 2021 with residual blood donor specimen using the same ELISA . To better inform the vaccination programme with local data , Malaysia also commissioned several seroconversion studies in 2021 , with IPH following the largest cohort of general population who received dif - ferent COVID - 19 vaccines over a year . The main strength of this study was its complex sampling design , which ensured the representativeness of Malaysia ’ s general popula - tion . As a result , the number of people with previous SARS - CoV - 2 infection and its breakdown into different subgroups could be esti - mated . Second , confirmation of the diagnosis with a neutralisation test makes our seroprevalence estimate more accurate in reflecting the level of protection against SARS - CoV - 2 in our population . How - ever , the opposite of this more specific case definition is that our results are a more conservative estimate of previous exposure to the virus . We recognise that the self - reported nature of the symptom sta - tus is subject to recall bias , which may be a limitation of our study . As for other data that could subject to the same bias , we verified them with documented proof where possible . 5 | CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 in Malaysia was low ( 0 . 49 % ) in the first year of the COVID - 19 pandemic before the emergence of vari - ants and mass vaccination but higher ( 0 . 63 % ) among adults . As a large proportion ( 84 . 1 – 90 . 1 % ) of SARS - CoV - 2 infection was asymptomatic and undiagnosed , an increase in SARS - CoV - 2 screening and testing was necessary and reflected in Malaysia ’ s testing strategy . The COVID - 19 pandemic continues to evolve amid mass vaccination and booster programmes to control it . This progress can be monitored through repeated SARS - CoV - 2 serosurveillance with an improved efficiency in the future . 6 of 8 CHONG ET AL .
