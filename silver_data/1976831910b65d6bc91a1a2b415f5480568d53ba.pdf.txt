Available evidence is conflicting . We investigated the prevalence of antibodies against SARS - CoV - 2 in the staff of a large public hospital with multiple sites in the Antwerp region of Belgium . Risk factors for infection were identified by means of a questionnaire and human resource data . We performed hospital - wide serology tests in the weeks following the first epi - demic wave ( 16 March to the end of May 2020 ) and combined the results with the answers from an individual questionnaire . Overall seroprevalence was 7 . 6 % . We found higher seropre - valences in nurses [ 10 . 0 % ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 8 . 9 – 11 . 2 ] than in physicians 6 . 4 % ( 95 % CI 4 . 6 – 8 . 7 ) , paramedical 6 . 0 % ( 95 % CI 4 . 3 – 8 . 0 ) and administrative staff ( 2 . 9 % ; 95 % CI 1 . 8 – 4 . 5 ) . Staff who indicated contact with a confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) colleague had a higher seroprevalence ( 12 . 0 % ; 95 % CI 10 . 7 – 13 . 4 ) than staff who did not ( 4 . 2 % ; 95 % CI 3 . 5 – 5 . 0 ) . The same findings were present for contacts in the pri - vate setting . Working in general COVID - 19 wards , but not in emergency departments or intensive care units , was also a significant risk factor . Since our analysis points in the direction of active SARS - CoV - 2 transmission within hospitals , we argue for implementing a stringent hospital - wide testing and contact - tracing policy with special attention to the health care work - ers employed in general COVID - 19 departments . Additional studies are needed to establish the transmission dynamics . Introduction Since the beginning of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) pandemic in December 2019 , the infection has been responsible for more than 170 million cases and more than 3 million deaths worldwide as of May 2021 [ 1 ] . Health care providers ( HCPs ) are on the frontline where there is remaining uncertainty about adequate management of personal protective equipment ( PPE ) [ 2 – 4 ] . Literature regard - ing the increased risks in HCPs is conflicting . Several serosurveys have been published showing that seropositivity in HCPs is not related to healthcare occupation , workplace factors , or con - tact with patients with known COVID - 19 [ 5 – 8 ] . In those surveys , significant associations were only found with community exposure or exposure in the private setting . Other studies and epi - demiological reports showed increased risks in HCPs , even where there is adequate availability of PPE [ 9 – 16 ] . The hospital network of Antwerp ( Ziekenhuisnetwerk Antwerpen , ZNA ) is a public multiple - site hospital , currently the largest in Belgium . It comprises three acute care hospitals [ each with an emergency department ( ED ) and intensive care unit ( ICU ) ] , a children ’ s hos - pital and five more chronic care facilities , with a total capacity of 2500 hospital beds . During the first COVID - 19 epidemic wave , ZNA was highly impacted and accounted for sub - stantial numbers of COVID - 19 admissions ( Fig . 1 ) . At the beginning of the COVID - 19 pandemic , a Scientific Board was established at ZNA , which comprised microbiologists , infection prevention and infectious disease specialists , pneumolo - gists and intensive care specialists , to advise the Hospital Direction Board . For infection prevention precautions , Belgian guidelines ( Sciensano ) were followed strictly [ 17 ] . Additionally , hospital - wide use of surgical masks was introduced on 16 March for all HCPs , and systematic testing of all patients on hos - pital admission was introduced on 1 April by SAR - CoV - 2 reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) . This was earl - ier than the testing policy issued by the Belgian governmental sci - entific service ( Sciensano ) [ 17 ] ( Fig . 1 ) . We conducted a voluntary hospital - wide SARS - CoV - 2 ser - ology survey from 9 June to 29 June 2020 and combined the results with the answers from a questionnaire that was sent to all hospital staff in the weeks following the first epidemic wave in Belgium ( 16 March to the end of May 2020 ) . The aim of the study was to determine seroprevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 in HCPs and identify potential risk factors ( type of ward , job category , ( un ) protected contact with positive cases and contact with positive cases in the private setting ) associated with ( a ) symptomatic infection with SARS - CoV - 2 , in order to optimise hospital strategies and procedures . Methods From 9 June to 29 June 2020 , all 6838 employees working at ZNA were offered a serological test . HCPs included all hospital staff ( nurses , doctors , paramedics , administrative and maintenance staff ) . The serology test was only performed if the questionnaire ( with questions concerning possible risk factors for exposure to SARS - CoV - 2 ) was completed . Questions covered the period from 1 March to the moment of the serology test . The questionnaire asked for time spent ( < 1week , 1 – 2 weeks , 3 – 4 weeks and > 4 weeks ) in different COVID - 19 departments . COVID - 19 departments consisted of suspected COVID - 19 units ( suspected COVID - 19 patients on general wards ) , confirmed COVID - 19 units ( confirmed COVID - 19 cases on general wards ) , COVID - 19 ED ( suspected / confirmed cases presenting in the ED ) and COVID - 19 ICUs ( suspected and confirmed COVID - 19 cases in the ICU ) . The following risk factors were included in the questionnaire : contact with persons in the private or household setting with con - firmed or suspected COVID - 19 and / or the indication that a close colleague at work had confirmed COVID - 19 . We also asked for potential contact with positive COVID - 19 patients ( suspected or confirmed ) , thereby applying hospital guidelines on PPE ( Fig . 1 ) . Furthermore , accidental contacts with COVID - 19 patients ( thus not following hospital guidelines on PPE ) ( sus - pected or confirmed ) was also registered in the questionnaire . No details on timing , frequency or duration of these contacts were registered . We used an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay test from Roche for the qualitative detection of total IgM and IgG SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies . The manufacturer reported a sensitivity of 95 % and a specificity of 99 % . All data were collected and combined with a human resource database which delivered date of birth , domicile and professional categories . All combined data were encoded anonymously in an Access - database . The database was transferred by a data protec - tion officer to the University of Antwerp which functioned as a trusted third party . Seroprevalence estimates are displayed with exact Clopper − Pearson 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs ) . Data from all partici - pating hospital staff were used for the analyses , with the following exception : analyses concerning the time spent on different COVID - 19 departments were restricted to data of hospital staff effectively having patient contacts ( e . g . nurses , doctors or parame - dics , but not administrative staff ) . Logistic linear mixed models with a random intercept for the hospital sites were used to investigate association between anti - SARS - CoV - 2 IgG seropositivity and work related risk factors Fig . 1 . Number of admitted patients in ZNA in relation with population and hospital precautions . 2 Reinout Naesens et al . as well as with age and sex . The random intercept accounts for the potential centre effects by the different hospital sites . All associa - tions were first assessed in univariate models . A stepwise model selection was performed , comparing the Akaike information cri - terion ( AIC ) of each model at a 5 % significance level , including possible interaction , to determine the goodness of fit [ 18 ] . All analyses were performed using the statistical software R ( version 4 . 0 . 3 ) { https : / / www . R - project . org / } using glmer ( ) from lme4 package for the logistic linear mixed models and binom . t - est ( ) for the seroprevalence estimates . The R code is available from the authors by request . The data that support the findings of this study are available from ZNA upon request . Each participant signed an informed consent form . Approval was obtained from the local Institutional Board Review ( Approval N° 5383 ) . Results A total of 5233 individuals aged between 17 and 73 years ( female 79 . 8 % , male 20 . 2 % ) participated in the seroprevalence survey . This number represents ( 76 . 5 % ) of the hospital staff and the par - ticipation rate was > 70 % at all different hospital sites . The study population ( i . e . participants ) was representative to the overall hos - pital workforce regarding age , sex and professional categories . 79 . 8 % of the study population were female , whereas 20 . 2 % were male . Of the participants , 397 [ 7 . 6 % ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 6 . 9 – 8 . 3 ] tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies . Seroprevalences in male and female participants were respectively 7 . 0 % ( 95 % CI 5 . 5 – 8 . 7 ) and 7 . 7 % ( 95 % CI 6 . 9 – 8 . 6 ) . Including only medical , nursing and paramedical staff with patient contacts , the seroprevalence was 8 . 7 % ( 95 % CI 7 . 9 – 9 . 7 ) . Among the 5233 participants , 1944 ( 37 . 1 % ) worked on a COVID - 19 ward including suspected COVID - 19 wards , confirmed COVID - 19 wards , COVID - 19 ED and COVID - 19 ICU . Seroprevalence in these HCPs was significantly higher ( 11 . 6 % ; 95 % CI 10 . 2 – 13 . 1 ) than for individuals not generally working on a COVID - 19 ward ( 5 . 2 % ; 95 % CI 4 . 5 – 6 ) . This obser - vation is the same over all hospital sites ( acute and chronic ) . Among those working on a COVID - 19 ward , only HCPs working on a confirmed COVID - 19 ward had higher seroprevalence ( 18 . 0 % ; 95 % CI 13 . 9 – 22 . 7 ) than HCPs who only worked on sus - pected COVID - 19 wards , COVID - 19 ED or COVID - 19 ICU ( Fig . 2 ) . Seroprevalence was higher for HCPs working for 3 – 4 weeks on confirmed COVID - 19 wards ( 22 . 9 % ; 95 % CI 14 . 4 – 33 . 4 ) and for those working for more than 4 weeks ( 19 . 4 % ; 95 % CI 15 . 9 – 23 . 3 ) than for staff spending less than a week ( 12 . 3 % ; 95 % CI 8 . 3 – 17 . 4 ) and 1 – 2 weeks ( 14 . 3 % ; 95 % CI 8 . 0 – 22 . 8 ) on these wards ( Fig . 3 ) . When comparing seroprevalence at the different hospital sites , there was no significant difference for the three larger acute care hospitals ( ZNA Middelheim , ZNA Stuivenberg and ZNA Jan Palfijn ) . Nevertheless , seroprevalences were significantly higher in two chronic care facilities ( rehabilitation and geriatric inpati - ents with dementia ) than in the acute care hospitals , respectively 13 . 0 % ( 95 % CI 9 . 0 – 18 . 0 ) and 22 . 7 % ( 95 % CI 17 . 9 – 28 . 0 ) . In the children ’ s hospital , seroprevalence was significantly lower than in the adult care facilities : 1 . 7 % ( 95 % CI 0 . 2 – 6 . 0 ) . With regard to profession , most participants ( n = 2660 ) were nursing staff ( 50 . 8 % ) , whereas 596 were medical staff ( 11 . 4 % ) , 654 administrative staff ( 12 . 5 % ) , 671 ( 12 . 8 % ) paramedical staff and 652 cleaning and technical services staff ( 12 . 5 % ) . Nursing staff had a significantly higher seroprevalence ( 10 . 0 % ; 95 % CI 8 . 9 – 11 . 2 ) than all other professional groups , and administrative staff had the lowest seroprevalence ( 2 . 9 % ; 95 % CI 1 . 8 – 4 . 5 ) . SARS - CoV - 2 serology in paramedical personnel was 6 . 0 % ( 95 % Fig . 2 . Seroprevalence in wards ( not all combinations are shown ) . Fig . 3 . Seroprevalence and exposure time in general ward cohort .

Whereas seroprevalence in medical staff was 6 . 4 % ( 95 % CI 4 . 6 – 8 . 7 ) . Physicians in specialty training had a seropreva - lence of 11 . 1 % ( 95 % CI 6 . 7 – 17 . 0 ) whereas attending doctors were positive in 4 . 7 % of cases ( 95 % CI 2 . 9 – 7 . 3 ) ( Fig . 4 ) . Staff who indicated that a close colleague at work had con - firmed COVID - 19 ( n = 2293 ; 43 . 8 % ) , had a significantly higher seroprevalence ( 12 . 0 % ; 95 % CI 10 . 7 – 13 . 4 ) than staff not reporting SARS - CoV - 2 infected colleagues ( 4 . 2 % ; 95 % CI 3 . 5 – 5 . 0 ) ( Fig . 5 ) . The same findings were present in staff that indicated contact with persons in the private or household setting with confirmed or suspected COVID - 19 ( 15 . 6 % ; 95 % CI 12 . 3 – 19 . 2 vs . 6 . 8 % ; CI 6 . 1 – 7 . 6 ) ( Fig . 5 ) . HCPs who reported contacts with positive COVID - 19 cases ( suspected or confirmed ) with adequate protection following hos - pital guidelines ( n = 3576 ; 68 . 3 % ) had significantly higher sero - prevalences than staff not reporting contacts ( n = 1657 ; 31 . 7 % ) : seroprevalence of respectively 9 . 4 % ( 95 % CI 8 . 5 – 10 . 4 ) vs . 3 . 7 % ( 95 % CI 2 . 8 – 4 . 7 ) . Staff who reported accidental , unprotected contact ( n = 1858 ; 35 . 5 % ) with COVID - 19 cases ( suspected or confirmed ) did not have significantly higher seroprevalences than staff who did not have these contacts ( n = 3375 ; 64 . 5 % ) , respectively , 9 . 0 % ( 95 % CI 7 . 7 – 10 . 4 ) vs . 6 . 8 % ( 95 % CI 6 . 0 – 7 . 7 ) . The final multivariate logistic mixed model included age , pro - fession , working on a COVID - 19 ward , indicating a close col - league at work had confirmed COVID - 19 , contact with confirmed / suspected COVID - 19 cases in private setting , at work with adequate protection and at work accidental with an inter - action term for the latter two ( Table 1 ) . The associations confirm the statements about the comparison of seroprevalences . Medical , paramedical and cleaning and technical staff had lower chances to be seropositive in comparison with nursing staff . An increased chance was observed when indicating a close colleague at work had confirmed COVID - 19 and having had contact with con - firmed / suspected COVID - 19 cases in private setting . In addition , higher age was associated with a lower chance to be seropositive . Including hospital sites as a fixed effect instead of as a random effect did not lead to different results . Discussion Among HCPs working in the Antwerp hospital network , SARS - CoV - 2 seroprevalence turned out to be 7 . 6 % ( 95 % CI 6 . 9 – 8 . 3 ) . As compared to the general Belgian population for the same testing period , seroprevalence in ZNA personnel was not significantly higher . In the general population aged 20 – 65 years , the seroprevalence totalled 6 . 3 % ( 95 % CI 5 . 1 – 7 . 7 ) [ 19 ] . Although there was a difference in sex distribution between the study population ( female 79 . 8 % , male 20 . 2 % ) and the general population ( female 50 . 7 % , male 49 . 3 % ) , statistically significant differences in seroprevalence regarding sex were not observed , neither in our study nor in the survey of the general population [ 19 , 20 ] . Also , different diagnostic tests were used in both surveys ( Roche ’ s Elecsys Anti - SARS - CoV - 2 assay in our study vs . Euro - Immun ’ s Anti - SARS - CoV - 2 IgG assay in the general Belgian population ) . However , these tests show a fairly equal diag - nostic performance , as external validation did not reveal statistic - ally different sensitivities / specificities [ 21 ] . Including only medical , nursing and paramedical staff with patient contacts , the seroprevalence was 8 . 7 % . This prevalence was in line with an HCP cohort followed by the Belgian Public Health Institute : for the same testing period , for 850 Belgian HCPs with patient contact from different hospitals throughout the country , the seroprevalence totalled 9 . 4 % ( 95 % CI 6 . 5 – 13 . 4 ) [ 22 ] . Given the results from the country as a whole , our facilities appeared comparable with regard to the use of protective equipment . Literature on seroprevalence in HCPs is limited , and findings vary substantially : from no additional risk in several serosurveys [ 5 – 8 ] to significantly higher risks in other publications [ 9 – 16 ] . A study in the UK and the United States estimated that front - line healthcare providers had a 3 . 4 - fold higher risk of reporting a SARS - CoV - 2 - positive test ( PCR or antibody test ) , adjusted for the Fig . 4 . Seroprevalence according to professional categories . Fig . 5 . Seroprevalence according to risk factors . 4 Reinout Naesens et al . likelihood of having a test , than people living in the general com - munity [ 9 ] . The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control ( ECDC ) analysed case - based surveillance data from a total of 124 . 796 reported cases with known healthcare worker status from 15 countries in the EU / EAA and the UK . The overall per - centage of HCPs among COVID - 19 cases was 23 % ( n = 43 774 / 188 693 ) , with a country median of 14 % ( range 1 – 59 % ) [ 16 ] . In our opinion , one must be very careful in coming to conclu - sions regarding the low risk of exposure in HCPs reflected in some of the publications . Firstly , the timing of serology - testing is crucial . Indeed , we carried out our testing in the first weeks fol - lowing the first pandemic wave when Belgium was in full lock - down and social contacts were very limited outside the hospital ( Fig . 1 ) . Testing too early in an epidemic wave leads to potentially low cumulative exposure of hospital staff to positive individuals , which was already suggested by Mansour et al . [ 13 ] . Waning immunity and an increase in social contacts because of relaxation of measures [ 23 ] have a negative impact on correct interpretation of seroprevalence numbers in HCPs , due to delay in testing . Secondly , defining groups in the frontline accurately is crucial : when the cumulative time spent on the COVID - 19 wards is lim - ited , additional risks may become undetectable . Thirdly , the type of test performed is crucial . Highly sensitive and highly specific tests are needed for correct interpretation . If one or more of those items is lacking , results may be falsely reassuring , as might have been the case in the article by Steensels et al . and Jacob et al . [ 5 , 6 ] . Seroprevalence in ZNA HCPs working in confirmed COVID - 19 wards was significantly higher than in other HCPs ( Fig . 2 ) . For the confirmed COVID - 19 wards , we found a time - related trend , although statistically insignificant , towards higher seroprevalences ( Fig . 3 ) . One possible explanation for these find - ings may be patient behaviour . Patients do not always wear masks Table 1 .

Epidemiology and Infection 5 ( in line with hospital guidelines , e . g . geriatric patients suffering from dementia or delirium ) . The importance of behavioural and clinical characteristics is also reflected in the significantly higher seroprevalences in two chronic care hospitals with a majority of elderly people . We could not identify factors , except for above - mentioned study - design confounders , explaining why this higher exposure in general COVID - 19 wards was not withheld by some other study groups [ 5 , 6 ] . The level of adherence to the guidelines and / or infrastructural factors ( for example ventilation ) might have been underlying factors . On the other hand , our findings were consistent at all hospital sites . In our opinion , even with predetermined PPE , it is difficult to attain zero risk exposure to the SARS - CoV - 2 virus in COVID - 19 units . This is also reflected by the high association of seropreva - lence in hospital staff who have been in contact with COVID - 19 cases and have been using PPE , in line with hospital guidelines . Surprisingly , this association was not found in the large ( > 20 . 000 HCP ) multi - centre study in three states of the US [ 5 ] ( Fig . 5 ) . Working on COVID - 19 ED and ICU wards was not related to significantly higher seroprevalences . For the ED , although the numbers of patient contacts may be higher , cumulative time of exposure of HCPs to COVID - 19 positive patients is far lower than exposure on a hospital ward . The contacts may also be less intense ( e . g . hygienic care of patient ) . Another hypothesis for the lower seroprevalence in HCPs working in COVID - 19 ICUs could be the lower viral loads in these patients than in patients on general COVID - 19 wards ( unpublished ZNA data ) , the higher use of closed - loop circuit ventilation ( with appropriate heat and moisture exchange filters ) and the higher nurse - to - patient ratio , resulting in lower ‘ at risk exposure time ’ [ 24 ] . In our study , there was a clear association of professional cat - egory with antibody positivity ( nurses having highest rates ) , again consistent with some studies or epidemiological reports , but con - flicting with other surveys [ 5 , 15 , 25 ] ( Fig . 4 ) . As regard to age , higher seroprevalences were found in the younger adult age groups . This was also found in other surveys : Jacob et al . showed community - associated increased risks of sero - positivity in HCP being younger than 30 years [ 5 ] . Also in the general population of Antwerp , the age group of 21 – 30 years old had significantly higher rates of viral carriership as compared to the age group of 51 – 60 years old [ 26 ] . Beside the community - associated factor , it might also be that elder HCPs were more experienced and adherent with hospital procedures . Interestingly , positive cases in HCPs in our hospital were clus - tered . This finding was most overt in the nurse group . Although our hospital was quick to recognise the role of asymptomatic indi - viduals , HCPs may have been insufficiently aware of that invisible risk . Also , testing policy in the first viral wave mainly focused on symptomatic HCPs . As a result of this survey , our communication strategy was to advise all HCPs to be more sensitive to the risks of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission between colleagues . Also , a stringent testing and contact - tracing policy has been put in place with spe - cial attention to the health care workers employed in general COVID - 19 departments . Our study shows several limitations . This subjective question - naire ( in which there was an indication that an HCP had a close colleague with confirmed COVID - 19 ) was not externally validated by the number of objectively determined COVID - 19 cases among the total hospital staff . No correction was made for an individual ’ s total working time on one COVID - 19 ward , in relation to their working time on another COVID - 19 ward . Both factors could have impacted our results . In conclusion , our analyses show that working on confirmed COVID - 19 wards led to a higher risk of being exposed to SARS - CoV - 2 than not working on COVID - 19 wards . Risks for staff working in ED departments and ICU were within the esti - mated ranges of the general Belgian population . The risk was clearly related to professional categories with nurses belonging to the highest risk group . More positive SARS - CoV - 2 serology cases were documented when contacts with infected colleagues or household members were reported . Acknowledgements . Prof .
