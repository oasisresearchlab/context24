It plays important roles in cellular function and exists either in the monomeric ( G - actin ) or polymeric form ( F - actin ) . Members of the actin - depoly - merizing factor ( ADF ) / cofilin protein family bind to both G - actin and F - actin and play vital roles in actin dynamics by manipulating the rates of filament polymerization and depolymeri - zation . It has been reported that the S6D and R98A / K100A mutants of actin - depolymerizing factor 1 ( ADF1 ) in Arabidopsis thaliana decreased the binding affinity of ADF for the actin monomer . To investigate the binding mechanism and dynamic behavior of the ADF1 – actin complex , we constructed a homology model of the AtADF1 – actin complex based on the crystal structure of AtADF1 and the twinfilin C - terminal ADF - H domain in a complex with a mouse actin monomer . The model was then refined for subsequent molecular dynamics simulations . Increased binding energy of the mutated system was observed using the Molecular Mechanics Generalized Born Surface Area and Poisson – Boltzmann Surface Area ( MM - GB / PBSA ) methods . To determine the residues that make decisive contributions to the ADF1 actin - binding affinity , per - residue decomposition and computational alanine scanning analyses were performed , which provided more detailed information on the bind - ing mechanism . Root - mean - square fluctuation and principal component analyses con - firmed that the S6D and R98A / K100A mutants induced an increased conformational flexibility . The comprehensive molecular insight gained from this study is of great impor - tance for understanding the binding mechanism of ADF1 and G - actin . Introduction Actin is a highly conserved protein . As one of the most abundant proteins in most eukaryotic cells , actin plays important roles in cellular functions such as endocytosis , organelle movement , cell division , cell mobility , and maintenance of cell shape [ 1 – 3 ] . Those functions are influenced by rapid transitions between monomeric ( G - actin ) and filamentous ( F - actin ) states regulated by a large number of actin - binding proteins ( ABPs ) in the cell , such as capping proteins and PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0159053 July 14 , 2016 1 / 16 a11111 OPEN ACCESS Citation : Du J , Wang X , Dong C - H , Yang JM , Yao XJ ( 2016 ) Computational Study of the Binding Mechanism of Actin - Depolymerizing Factor 1 with Actin in Arabidopsis thaliana .

Competing Interests : The authors have declared that no competing interests exist . severing proteins . Actin - capping proteins bind to actin and enhance filament depolymeriza - tion , and actin - severing proteins enhance fragmentation . Actin - depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) / cofilin proteins are actin - severing proteins , and are highly conserved among eukaryotes [ 4 – 8 ] . They bind to both monomeric and filamentous actin , and play vital and complicated roles in actin dynamics by controlling the rate of filament polymerization and depolymerization [ 9 ] . The ADF / cofilin proteins are involved in primary filament depolymerization , and facilitate actin turnover by severing actin filaments and increasing the rate of dissociation of actin mono - mers from the pointed ends of actin filaments [ 8 , 10 – 12 ] . The activity of ADF / cofilin proteins is tightly controlled in response to various cellular activities . In plants , the activity of ADF is regulated by several factors such as N - terminal phosphorylation and pH [ 13 – 16 ] . In the genus Arabidopsis , there are 11 expressed members of the ADF family that are grouped into four ancient subclasses [ 17 ] . AtADF1 belongs to subclass I , and is strongly expressed in an extensive range of tissues including flowers , seedlings , roots , and mature leaves [ 10 , 17 , 18 ] . In 2000 , the crystal structure of ADF1 from Arabidopsis thaliana was determined by Bowman et al . ; it was the first ADF / cofilin structure from the plant kingdom to be deter - mined [ 19 ] . However , the structure of an ADF in complex with actin was not determined until 2008 when Paavilainen et al . reported the crystal structure of the twinfilin C - terminal ADF - H domain in a complex with a mouse actin monomer ( PDB ID : 3DAW ) , which indicated that the ADF - H domain binds to G - actin with the long α - helix inserted into the hydrophobic cleft between subdomains 1 and 3 of actin [ 20 ] . By then , numerous crystal structures of ADF / coffin from different organisms had been determined [ 21 – 28 ] . Dong et al . ( 2013 ) reported that in A . thaliana ADF1 is predominantly phosphorylated by AtCDPK6 at serine 6 , which prevents ADF1 from binding to actin . The subsequent mutation experiment demonstrated that the S6D and R98A / K100A mutants of ADF1 in A . thaliana decreased the binding affinity of the ADF for both actin monomers and filaments [ 29 , 30 ] . Others have explored the mechanism of interaction between ADF / cofilin and actin using computational methods . Wriggers et al . built a structure model of an ADF / cofilin - G - actin complex based on the crystal structure of the actin - gelsolin segment - 1 complex by docking and molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations [ 31 – 36 ] . Sept et al . then studied the association rate of actin monomers bound with ADF based on this model using the Brownian dynamics method [ 32 ] . The molecular interaction mechanism between cofilin and actin filaments has also been investigated using all - atom MD simulations , coarse - grained MD simulations , and normal mode analysis , which provided insight into the overall mechanism how ADF / cofilin binding influences the structure and mechanical properties of actin filaments [ 33 – 36 ] . However , detailed understanding of the direct molecular interactions between ADF and G - actin , and the dynamic behavior after ADF1 mutation in A . thaliana , were still lacking . Here , we modeled an AtADF1 actin monomer complex structure based on the crystal struc - ture of AtADF1 and the twinfilin C - terminal ADF - H domain in a complex with an actin monomer . We then refined the features of the model in order to perform MD simulations . Molecular Mechanics Generalized Born Surface Area and Poisson – Boltzmann Surface Area ( MM - GB / PBSA ) methods were used to calculate the binding free energy between ADF1 and actin . Per - residue decomposition and computational alanine scanning analyses were per - formed to determine the residues that make decisive contributions to ADF1 and actin binding affinity . Root - mean - square fluctuations ( RMSFs ) and principal component analysis confirmed that S6D and R98A / K100A mutations increased conformational flexibility . Our study provides a comprehensive molecular insight into the binding mechanism of ADF1 and G - actin , and gives an explanation for the reduced binding affinity of mutated ADF1 to G - actin at atomic level . Moreover , such information provides novel clues for further mutation experiments on the ADF / cofilin family .

The crystal structure of AtADF1 ( PDB ID : 1F7S ) was obtained from the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics ( RCSB ) Protein Data Bank [ 37 ] and aligned to the twinfilin C - termi - nal ADF - H domain . The missing residues ( 2 - ANA - 4 , 129 - MDLDVFRSRAN - 139 ) were also built based on this structure by Modeller [ 38 ] . The sequence of actin1 ( accession number : AEC09427 . 1 ) was downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information ( NCBI ) [ 39 ] . A homology model of actin1 was built using the actin monomer of 3DAW as a template ( protein sequence identity = 88 % ) by Modeller [ 38 ] . Molecular dynamics simulation The model was then refined to eliminate bad contacts by using Amber 14 . The force field param - eters for Mg 2 + ion and ATP were downloaded from the Amber parameter database [ 40 , 41 ] . A standard AMBER ff03 . r1 force field was assigned to the protein [ 42 , 43 ] . In the experimental work , the purification for ADF1 and actin were performed under different pH conditions ( pH = 7 for ADF1 and pH = 8 for actin ) [ 29 ] . The ionizable residues were predicted with the same protonation states under both conditions based on the pKa values calculated by the H + + server [ 44 ] and PROPKA3 . 1 [ 45 , 46 ] , which were consistent with the default set of AMBER . The protonation state of ionizable residues was set at the default value for pH 7 . Systems were neutralized by adding Na + ions . The built complex was solvated in a rectangular box filled with TIP3P water molecules [ 47 ] , maintaining a 10 - Å distance between any solute atom and the boundary . In the first stage , the water molecules and ions were relaxed by restraining the whole protein and ligands ( 5000 cycles of steepest descent and 2000 cycles of conjugate gradient mini - mizations ) ; second , the side chains of the protein were relaxed by restraining the backbone of the proteins and ligands ( 5000 cycles of steepest descent and 2000 cycles of conjugate gradient mini - mizations ) ; third , the whole system was relaxed without any restrains ( 5000 cycles of steepest descent and 5000 cycles of conjugate gradient minimizations ) . After minimization , the model was gradually heated from 0 to 300 K within 50 ps with the backbone of proteins restrained ( 500 kcal / mol / Å 2 ) in the NVT ensemble . Then , the model was relaxed within 2 . 55 ns from 500 to 0 kcal / mol / Å 2 in the NPT ensemble . The final equilibration phase lasted 1 ns without restraints . All molecular dynamics simulations were performed using the GPU version of the PMEMD engine provided with Amber 14 . First , the initial model was subjected to a 40 ns MD simulation to reach equilibrium . A snapshot was then extracted from the equilibrium stage as the wild type ( WT ) and the mutation was carried out . Four systems , ADF1 - WT , ADF1 - S6D , phosphorylated form ADF1 - S6 phos and ADF1 - R98A / K100A in a complex with actin , were subjected to simulations . The detailed protocol was mentioned above . MD simulations were conducted in the WT , ADF1 - S6D , ADF1 - S6 phos and ADF1 - R98A / K10A systems at 100 ns to produce trajectories , respectively . The covalent bonds to hydrogen atoms were constrained using the SHAKE algorithm , and the Particle Mesh Ewald ( PME ) method [ 48 ] was employed to calculate long - range electrostatic inter - actions . The cut - off for van der Waals interactions was set to 10 Å . The time step used for the sim - ulations was set to 2 fs . The atom coordinates were saved every 10 ps for subsequent analysis . Binding free energy calculation The MM - GB / PBSA methods were applied to calculate the binding free energies between ADF1 and actin [ 49 – 51 ] . For each system , 500 snapshots were collected from the 10 ns of the trajectory Binding of ADF1 with Actin in Arabidopsis thaliana PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0159053 July 14 , 2016 3 / 16 after equilibration with 20 ps intervals . The binding free energy between ADF1 ( receptor ) and actin ( ligand ) was calculated as follows : D G binding ¼ G complex (cid:2) G receptor (cid:2) G ligand ¼ D G gas þ D G solv ð 1 Þ D G gas ¼ D H gas (cid:2) T D S (cid:3) D E MM (cid:2) T D S ð 2 Þ D G binding (cid:3) D E MM þ D G solv (cid:2) T D S ð 3 Þ D E MM ¼ D E int þ D E vdw þ D E ele ð 4 Þ D G solv ¼ D G GB = PB þ D G SA ð 5 Þ D G SA ¼ g (cid:4) D A þ b ð 6 Þ SE ¼ STD ﬃﬃﬃﬃ N p ð 7 Þ G complex , G receptor , G ligand are the free energies of complex , receptor , and ligand , respectively . According to MM - PBSA and MM - GBSA theory , the binding free energy ( Δ G binding ) is com - posed of two parts : the gas phase molecular mechanical ( MM ) energy ( Δ G gas ) and the solvation free energy ( Δ G solv ) . It can also be decomposed into three terms : the molecular mechanical energy term ( Δ E MM , a sum of the changes of Δ E int , Δ E ele , and Δ E vdw ) , the solvation energy term ( Δ G solv ) , and the vibrational entropy term ( T Δ S ) . Δ E int , Δ E ele , and Δ E vdw are given as internal energy contribution , electrostatic , and van der Waals interaction terms , respectively . Δ E int is canceled between ligand , receptor , and complex by using a single trajectory strategy , and it can significantly reduce the noise in most cases . The change of solvation energy ( Δ G solv ) comprises the polar component ( Δ G GB / PB ) and the nonpolar component of the desolvation energy ( Δ G SA ) . The polar solvation contribution ( Δ G GB / PB ) can be calculated using the Poisson – Boltz - mann ( PB ) and Generalized Born ( GB ) equation . The dielectric constant for solvent was set to 80 and for solute was set to 1 , 2 or 4 , respectively . The nonpolar component of the desolvation energy ( Δ G SA ) can be estimated using Eq 6 , where Δ A represents the change of the solvent - accessible surface area ( SASA ) of the system calculated using the LCPO algorithm [ 52 ] , and the fitting coefficients γ and β were set to 0 . 0072 kcal / mol (cid:5) Å 2 and 0 in GB [ 53 ] , and 0 . 00542 kcal / mol (cid:5) Å 2 and 0 . 92 kcal / mol in PB , respectively [ 53 – 55 ] . The term ( T Δ S ) in Eq 2 is the change in the conformational entropy upon ligand binding . Here , normal - mode analysis ( NMA ) was used for the calculation of the conformational entropy [ 56 ] , which was calculated from the sum of translational , rotational , and vibrational components , and as there was high computa - tional demand , only 125 snapshots extracted from the 10 ns of the MD trajectories after equili - bration with 80 ps intervals were used . All the atoms in ADF1 - actin complex were used for the normal mode calculation . Each snapshots were subjected to energy minimization for 10000 steps in the presence of a distance - dependent dielectric of 4 r ( i , j ) ( where r ( i , j ) is the distance between two atoms ) until the root - mean - square of the elements of the energy gradient vector is less than 0 . 001 kcal mol - 1 Å - 1 . The mass - weighted Hessian matrix for each minimized snapshot was calculated and diagonalized by using normal mode analysis . The obtained frequency of the normal mode was used to calculate the entropy . The calculation error bars are standard errors ( SE ) calculated using Eq 7 ; the STD is the standard deviation and N is the number of trajectory snapshots used in the calculation . Binding of ADF1 with Actin in Arabidopsis thaliana PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0159053 July 14 , 2016 4 / 16 To further investigate the molecular determinants of ADF1 binding to actin , the effective binding energies calculated using the MM - PBSA method were decomposed into the contribu - tions from individual residues [ 57 ] . Computational alanine scanning The computational alanine scanning method involves replacing the side chain of a given resi - due ( except glycine or proline ) with a methyl group ( alanine ) , then recalculating the absolute binding free energy of the mutated system [ 58 , 59 ] . In this work , the binding free energy of the alanine mutant was calculated using the MM - PBSA approach described above , with the snap - shots for the wild type complex . All energy terms were calculated for 500 snapshots along the last 10 ns trajectory with 20 ps intervals . ΔΔ G bind was defined by the following equation , where Δ G bind is the summation of the molecular mechanical energy term ( Δ E MM ) and the solvation energy term ( Δ G solv ) . DD G bind ¼ D G mutant bind (cid:2) D G wildtype bind Principal component analysis Principal component analysis was carried out using the PTRAJ module of AmberTools . Five thousand snapshots were taken from the MD simulation trajectories . To obtain the proper tra - jectory matrix , overall translation or rotation motion were removed by fitting the coordinate data to the average structure . The trajectory data were then utilized to generate a covariance matrix between the C α atoms i and j , defined as : C ij ¼ < ð x i (cid:2) < x i > Þð x j (cid:2) < x j > Þ > ð i ; j ¼ 1 ; 2 ; 3 ; . . . ; 3 N Þ Where x i and x j are Cartesian coordinates of the i th and j th C α atom , N is the number of the C α atoms considered , < x i > and < x j > represent the time average over all the configurations obtained in the MD simulation [ 60 – 62 ] . Results and Discussion Dynamics behavior of the WT and mutant systems ADF1 is composed of four α - helices and six β - strands ( Fig 1 ) . ADF1 binds to actin with the long α - helix inserted into the hydrophobic cleft ( groove ) between subdomains 1 and 3 of the actin . The constructed complex was subjected to a 40 - ns MD simulation to reach equilibrium . Subsequently , a snapshot was extracted from the equilibrium stage as the WT , and used as a starting point for the mutations . The protein stability of the four systems ( ADF1 - WT , ADF1 - S6D , ADF1 - S6 phos and ADF1 - R98A / K100A in complex with actin ) during the MD sim - ulations was monitored by root mean square deviation ( RMSD ) of the backbone atoms ( S1 Fig ) . The WT system reached equilibrium after 60 ns with average RMSDs of 1 . 80 Å . The ADF1 - S6D and ADF1 - S6 phos systems reached equilibrium after 30 ns with average RMSDs of 1 . 80 Å and 1 . 96 Å , respectively . However , the ADF1 - R98A / K100A system stabilized after 70 ns with a larger average RMSD value of 2 . 56 Å . Thus , based on the RMSD results , our MD simula - tions are reliable enough for further investigation . To identify which parts of the complex contributed most to protein mobility , the RMSF of the four systems versus the residue number was investigated ( Fig 2 ) . Three major sites were dis - tinguished in ADF1 that interact with actin : the N - terminal loop , the α 3 - helix , and the β 6 – α 4 loop [ 43 ] . It suggests that the R98A / K100A mutation in ADF1 induces a larger fluctuation on Binding of ADF1 with Actin in Arabidopsis thaliana PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0159053 July 14 , 2016 5 / 16 almost the whole ADF1 protein compared with the WT , especially in the N - terminal loop ( res - idues 2 – 8 ) and the β 6 – α 4 loop ( residues 116 – 139 ) ( Fig 2A ) . The protein mobility of ADF1 in the S6D mutation is slightly larger than in the WT . The residues with higher flexibility include residues 16 – 29 ( belonging to the α 1 helix ) and Gln122 ( belonging to the β 6 - strand ) . The pro - tein mobility of ADF1 with phosphorylated Ser6 varies not significant from the WT , compared with the mutated systems . The flexibilities of the actins in the three systems are similar except for residues 36 – 50 , which constitute a long loop belonging to subdomain 2 that is far away from the binding interface . Residues 349 – 354 , which interact with the N - terminal loop of ADF1 , became more flexible after ADF1 - R98A / K100A mutation ( Fig 2B ) . As can be seen from the RMSD and RMSF results , ADF1 was more flexible after mutation . To further explore the dynamic behavior of the complex , representative structures from the last 30 ns of the MD simulation trajectories of the mutation systems were superimposed on the WT according to the secondary structure of actin ( Fig 3A ) . A noticeable rigid rotation of ADF1 versus actin was observed , which brought the N - terminal loop in ADF1 away from the actin subdomain 1 , and brought the α 4 - helix in ADF1 close to the actin subdomain 3 in the ADF1 - R98A / K100A system . The angle , represented by the C α atoms of the three residues ( Lys293 in actin , Ser102 and Ser136 in ADF1 ) was measured to represent the degree of this rotation ( Fig 3A ) . The rotation angles of the four systems were monitored during the MD Fig 1 . The overall structure of actin - depolymerizing factor 1 ( ADF1 ) in complex with actin1 monomer .

The averaged rotation angle during the equilibrium stage of the WT , ADF1 - S6D , ADF1 - S6 phos and ADF1 - R98A / K100A systems were 31 . 74±2 . 58° , 35 . 25±2 . 23° , 29 . 62±2 . 96° and 23 . 21±2 . 19° , respectively . Total binding free energy and per - residue contributions between ADF1 and actin predicted by MM - GB / PBSA methods Generally , a low dielectric constant of ε = 1 is used for solute in Molecular Mechanics General - ized Born Surface Area and Poisson – Boltzmann Surface Area ( MM - GB / PBSA ) methods [ 63 ] . Larger values ε = 2 or ε = 4 are also reported [ 50 , 64 ] . Fig 2 .

The results were listed in S1 Table . The predicted binding free energy for the WT system is always smaller than the ADF1 - R98A / K100A system under three settings . The predicted binding free energy for the WT system is smaller than the ADF1 - S6D system with the setting of ε = 1 . When ε = 2 and 4 , the predicted binding free energy for the WT system is larger than the ADF1 - S6D system , which is not consistent with the conclusion in the experi - mental work [ 29 ] . The optimal value of the protein dielectric constant is still an problem need to be discussed in the literature [ 65 ] . In this work , ε = 1 made the best predictions . Based on the best results , the predicted binding free energy with the setting of ε = 1 is summarized in Table 1 . As shown in Table 1 , both the MM - GBSA and MM - PBSA results suggest that the phos - phorylation of Ser6 , S6D and R98A / K100A mutations of ADF1 led to reduced binding affinity . The predicted results are in agreement with the experimental findings that after mutation the binding affinity of ADF1 and actin decreases [ 29 , 30 ] . Further analysis suggested that the main differences in binding free energy between the WT and the mutations arose from van der Waals interactions and the electrostatic energy ( sum of the electrostatic solvation free energy and MM electrostatic energy , Δ G GB / Δ G PB + Δ E ele ) contribution . The calculated van der Waals contributions in the WT , ADF1 - S6D , ADF1 - S6 phos and ADF1 - R98A / K100A systems were - 107 . 15 kcal / mol , - 111 . 78 kcal / mol , - 113 . 34 kcal / mol and - 107 . 49 kcal / mol , respectively . The electrostatic energy values for the WT , ADF1 - S6D , ADF1 - S6 phos and ADF1 - R98A / K100A sys - tems were 32 . 19 / 47 . 96 kcal / mol , 38 . 55 / 56 . 07 kcal / mol , 36 . 69 / 59 . 76 kcal / mol , and 36 . 09 / 57 . 01 kcal / mol in MM - GB / PBSA , respectively . Therefore , to achieve a more precise quantitative interpretation of binding affinity , per - resi - due basis binding free energy decomposition was performed to determine the individual energy contribution to the interaction energy ( S2 Table ) . A residue was reported only if the per - resi - due energy contribution difference between the WT and the mutation systems was larger than 1 . 00 kcal / mol ( Fig 4 ) . The ADF1 S6D mutation affected binding affinity mainly through resi - dues Asp26 , Asp27 , Ser147 , Arg149 , Asp294 , Lys328 , Lys330 , Arg337 , Gln356 , Lys375 and Phe377 in actin , and residues Ala2 , Ser / Asp6 , Asp93 , Arg98 , Lys100 and Thr124 in ADF1 ( Fig 4A ) . The summation of the energy contribution of Glu128 ( ADF1 ) and Arg149 ( actin ) is - 5 . 19 kcal / mol in the WT system versus 5 . 35 kcal / mol in the ADF1 - S6D system ( S2 Table ) . These two residues form hydrogen bond interactions in the WT system . The summation of the energy contribution of Ser6 / Asp6 ( ADF1 ) and Phe354 ( actin ) is - 7 . 03 kcal / mol in the WT system ver - sus - 3 . 02 kcal / mol in the ADF1 - S6D system ( S2 Table ) . These two residues form OH - π interac - tions in the WT system . To calculate the OH - π interaction strength , 5000 snapshots were extracted to measure the angle of OH with the center of the benzene and the distance between the H atom of OH and the center of the benzene . Only an angle between 65° and 90° and a dis - tance between 2 . 0 Å and 3 . 5 Å indicated a strong interaction . We observed that the hydroxyl of Table 1 .

After S6D mutation , most of the interaction residues became unfavorable to the binding affinity except Asp26 , Lys328 and Lys330 in actin , and Ala2 and Arg98 in ADF1 . The phosphorylation of Ser 6 affected binding affinity mainly through many residues ( Fig 4B ) . The significant changes included the following interactions between ADF1 and actin . The summation of the energy contribution of Glu128 ( ADF1 ) and Arg149 ( actin ) is - 5 . 19 kcal / mol in the WT system versus 2 . 94 kcal / mol in the ADF1 - S6 phos system ( S2 Table ) . The summation of the energy contribution of Ser6 ( ADF1 ) and Phe354 ( actin ) is - 7 . 03 kcal / mol in the WT sys - tem versus 1 . 85 kcal / mol in the ADF1 - S6 phos system ( S2 Table ) . The electrostatic energy con - tributions of Phe354 and Ser6 were 0 . 13 kcal / mol ( WT ) and 9 . 34 kcal / mol ( ADF1 - S6 phos ) . We can see that with the R98A / K100A mutation , more residues changed the energy contri - bution ( Fig 4C ) . The significant change was the increase of the summation of the energy contri - bution of Glu128 ( ADF1 ) and Arg149 ( actin ) , which is - 5 . 19 kcal / mol in the WT system versus 4 . 36 kcal / mol in the ADF1 - R98A / K100A system ( S2 Table ) . Another significant change was the increase of the energy contribution of Ser6 ( belonging to the ADF1 N - terminal loop ) , and T353 , F354 , and Q356 ( belonging to actin subdomain 1 ) . The significant reduction in the energy contribution was caused by the rigid rotation of ADF1 , which brings the N - terminal loop away from the interaction surface and breaks the interactions between the residues men - tioned above . In particular , the OH - π interaction between Ser6 in ADF1 and Phe354 in actin disappeared in most of the trajectories in the ADF1 - R98A / K100A system ( S2B Fig ) . The rigid Fig 4 .

The summation of the energy contribution of these residues changed considerably , which is also unfavorable for the binding of the ADF – actin complex . The overall energy contributions from the residues mentioned above were - 3 . 56 kcal / mol ( WT system ) and 0 . 18 kcal / mol ( R98A / K100A mutation system ) ( S2 Table ) . Computational alanine scanning on ADF1 residues Residues at 8 Å around the binding surface in ADF1 were calculated except for glycine and proline . The results of computational alanine scanning for ADF1 residues are shown in Fig 5 . A positive ΔΔ G bind value means that the residue was energetically more favorable than the cor - responding alanine residue . The residues with a ΔΔ G bind value larger than 2 . 00 kcal / mol were considered hot spots . As can be seen , there are twelve “ hot spot ” residues on ADF , which belong to the α 3 - helix ( residues 97 – 111 ) , namely Lys96 , Val97 , Arg98 , Met101 , Ile102 , Lys107 , and Lys111 . The top five hot spots , with ΔΔ G bind larger than 4 . 00 kcal / mol , were Lys98 , Met101 , Lys107 , Thr124 and Glu128 . Some of the predicted hot spots , including Arg98 , Met101 , and Ile102 , are supported by a previous site mutagenesis study [ 66 ] . The other resi - dues , including Lys96 , Val97 , Lys107 , Lys111 , Thr124 and Glu128 , which were not identified in the former study [ 66 ] , are worthy of verification by further mutagenesis experiments . Larger magnitudes of the atomic fluctuations in the mutation systems than the WT system Principal component analysis identifies and quantifies which collective atomic motions con - tribute most to the overall motion of the molecule during simulation . PCA on the conforma - tions of the WT , phosphorylated and mutation systems highlighted significant differences in the motion as a result of the mutations and phosphorylation . From the PCA plot , it is clear that eigenvectors computed from the MD trajectory for the WT / ADF1 - S6D , WT / ADF1 - S6 phos and WT / ADF1 - R98A / K100A systems varied greatly , which clearly indicates the difference in pro - tein motions as a result of mutations and phosphorylation ( Fig 6 ) . To get a direct observation of protein motion after equilibrium , we performed PCA and presented the results as porcupine plots . We can observe that the motions of the four systems were qualitatively different ( Fig 7 ) . The magnitudes of the atomic fluctuations in ADF1 - S6D , ADF1 - S6 phos and ADF1 - R98A / K100A systems were larger than that in the WT system . The mutation systems also induced Fig 5 .

The ADF1 - S6D had a more complicated motion direction that resulted from contributions of the N - terminal loop , the α 1 - helix , and the β 4 – β 5 loop ( Fig 7A ) . The motion of ADF1 - S6 phos varies from the WT and ADF1 - S6D , which mainly resulted form the contributions of the α 4 - helix , and the β 4 – β 5 loop ( Fig 7B ) . It is clear that the motion of ADF1 - R98A / K100A primarily resulted from contributions of the N - terminal loop , the β 4 – β 5 loop , and the β 6 – β 4 loop ( Fig 7C ) . Conclusion In the present study , the binding mechanism of ADF1 with actin1 was explored using a com - bined computational protocol . Based on the snapshots from the MD simulations , the binding Fig 6 .

The van der Waals and electrostatic energy ( the sum of the electrostatic sol - vation free energy and MM electrostatic energy ) contribution differences were the main factors affecting the binding affinity . Further computational alanine scanning found critical residues , such as Arg98 , Met101 , Lys107 , Thr124 and Glu128 , and interactions that are important for ADF1 and actin binding affinity . The dynamic behavior studies using RMSF and PCA showed that ADF1 - S6D and ADF1 - R98A / K100A induced larger flexibility to the protein compared with the WT . Rigid rotation was triggered , which broke the interaction between the N - terminal loop and residues 353 – 356 in actin subdomain 1 . In summary , the present study underlines the use of MD simulations in combination with MM - GB / PBSA free energy calculations to provide a detailed description of the binding mechanism of ADF1 and actin at the atomic level . Through per - residue decomposition and computational alanine scanning , a list of the impor - tant residues for ADF1 and actin binding were determined , which provides clues for further mutation experiments on the ADF / cofilin family .
