The proteins myosin and actin 13 interact in the myocardium to produce contraction through the actomyosin ATPase cycle . The 14 duty ratio ( r ) of myosin is the proportion of the actomyosin ATPase cycle that myosin is bound 15 to actin and does work . A common hypothesis is that HCM mutations increase contraction in 16 cardiac sarcomeres ; however , the available data is not clear on this connection . Based on 17 previous work with human α - cardiac actin ( ACTC ) , we hypothesize that HCM - linked ACTC 18 variants with alterations near the myosin binding site have an increased r , producing more force . 19 Myosin duty ratios using human ACTC variant proteins were calculated with myosin ATPase 20 activity and in vitro motility data . We found no consistent changes in the duty ratio of the ACTC 21 variants , suggesting that other factors are involved in the development of HCM when ACTC 22 variants are present . 23 24 Keywords : hypertrophic cardiomyopathy , cardiac actin , mutations , actomyosin , duty ratio 25 26 Page 2 of 24 https : / / mc06 . manuscriptcentral . com / bcb - pubs Biochemistry and Cell Biology D r a ft 3 Introduction 27 Cardiovascular disease ( CD ) is the most costly global disorder and has become the 28 greatest cause of mortality in the world , being responsible for one third of deaths worldwide with 29 immense economic costs ( “WHO | Cardiovascular diseases ( CVDs ) ” 2016 ) . In Canada alone , 30 where there are more than 35 million people , over $ 20 billion is spent annually to treat CD 31 ( Tarride et al . 2009 ) . Among the many forms of CD , hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( HCM ) is an 32 inherited disease that , among a heterogeneous spectrum of abnormalities ( Pandian et al . 2015 ) , 33 commonly results in the overgrowth of the left ventricle and is a leading cause of sudden cardiac 34 death in individuals under the age of 30 ( Seidman and Seidman 2001 , Gajewski and Saul 2010 , 35 Maron et al . 2014 ) . 36 The functional units of the heart muscle are sarcomeres which contain actin and myosin 37 proteins . These interact together in a power stroke , shortening the sarcomeres , leading to muscle 38 contraction . The power stroke requires the hydrolysis of ATP by myosin when bound to actin 39 ( Fox , 2012 ) . The force produced by myosin and actin in the sarcomere is termed the ensemble 40 force and can be calculated with the equation : 41 F EN = N t · f i · r , ( Eq 1 ) 42 where N t is the number of individual actomyosin interactions , f i is the force per actomyosin 43 interaction , and r is the duty ratio of myosin ( Sommese et al . 2013 ) . The myosin duty ratio is the 44 proportion of the actomyosin ATPase cycle that myosin is bound to actin and can be calculated 45 using the equation : 46 r = ( k cat ·δ ) / v o ( Eq 2 ) 47 where k cat is the k cat of myosin’s ATPase activity , v o is the velocity of the enzyme , and δ is the 48 step size of myosin ( Howard 1997 ) . 49 Page 3 of 24 https : / / mc06 . manuscriptcentral . com / bcb - pubs Biochemistry and Cell Biology D r a ft 4 The symptoms of HCM patients commonly include hyperdynamic systolic function 50 ( Pandian et al . 2015 ) , suggesting that sarcomere protein changes in HCM hearts result in 51 hypercontractility . However , current data does not sufficiently connect HCM - causing mutations 52 with hypercontractile sarcomeres ( discussed in ( Spudich 2014 ) ) . Nevertheless , changes in the 53 duty ratio of myosin will reflect changes in the contraction of HCM - affected hearts , with higher 54 duty ratios associated with hypercontractility . 55 HCM has been associated with 12 different α− cardiac actin ( ACTC ) gene mutations . 56 Four ACTC variants found in HCM patients possess changes in or near the actomyosin - binding 57 site : H88Y , F90∆ , R95C , and E99K ( Figure 1A ) ( Olson et al . 2000 , Morita et al . 2008 , Kaski et 58 al . 2009 , Behrmann et al . 2012 ) . We previously examined the connection between HCM - related 59 human ACTC mutations and altered actomyosin interactions with 8 variants of ACTC , including 60 the E99K variant located in the actomyosin - binding site ( Dahari and Dawson 2015 ) . While the 61 E99K ACTC protein resulted in a higher duty ratio , we found that the other variants resulted in 62 duty ratios similar to wild - type ACTC protein . We hypothesized that the position of the amino 63 acid change on ACTC resulting from mutation impacts proteins binding at that site . For example , 64 the E99K substitution is located in the actomyosin binding site ( Behrmann et al . 2012 ) and will 65 affect myosin function . R95 on ACTC may form a salt bridge with E576 and hydrogen bonds 66 with three other residues on myosin ( Lorenz and Holmes 2010 ) . With the loss of these 67 interactions , R95C ACTC might exhibit similar defects to those of E99K - ACTC . With H88Y 68 ACTC , the affected residue is on the same alpha helix in ACTC as R95 and E99 . While more 69 distal from the actomyosin interface , an amino acid substitution may interfere with the packing 70 of residues along the helix , thereby indirectly inhibiting actomyosin interactions . Finally , 71 deletion mutants in actin are very rare , and the deletion of F90 in the helix containing R95 and 72 Page 4 of 24 https : / / mc06 . manuscriptcentral . com / bcb - pubs Biochemistry and Cell Biology D r a ft 5 E99 might alter the register and position of those amino acids , possibly disrupting interactions in 73 the actomyosin interface , resulting effects on actomyosin activity . 74 To test this hypothesis , we produced four HCM - related human ACTC variant proteins 75 with changes in or near the actomyosin binding site , including the E99K variant for comparison . 76 We calculated the duty ratios using myosin ATPase activity and in vitro motility assays , with the 77 expected result that all variants in the actomyosin binding site will exhibit increased myosin duty 78 ratios . Our work is the first biochemical analysis of the three subdomain - 1 ACTC variant 79 proteins H88Y , F90∆ , and R95C . Contrary to our expected results , we found that only E99K - 80 ACTC produced an increase in the duty ratio of myosin , suggesting that multiple factors play a 81 role in the development of HCM in the presence of other subdomain - 1 ACTC variants . 82 83 Materials and methods 84 Reagents and Basic Protocols 85 All reagents were obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific or Sigma - Aldrich , unless stated 86 otherwise . Recombinant purified ACTC protein concentrations were determined using Bio - Rad 87 protein assay dye and skeletal actin standards following the manufacturer’s protocol ( Hercules , 88 CA ) . 10 % polyacrylamide resolving gels were used to conduct SDS - PAGE with a 5 % stacking 89 gel . Samples were mixed with 2x Laemmli buffer at a 1 : 2 ratio of buffer to sample ( 50 mM Tris , 90 pH 6 . 8 , 2 % SDS , 10 % glycerol , 1 . 3 M βME and 0 . 1 % bromophenol blue ) ( Laemmli 1970 ) . Gels 91 were run for 45 minutes at 180 mV with a 1X running buffer ( 25 mM Tris , 250 mM glycine , and 92 0 . 1 % SDS ) , and stained with Coomassie Stain and destained in 40 % methanol , 10 % acetic acid . 93 94 Protein Purification 95 Page 5 of 24 https : / / mc06 . manuscriptcentral . com / bcb - pubs Biochemistry and Cell Biology D r a ft 6 Pure myosin and heavy meromyosin ( HMM ) was obtained from rabbit soleus muscle 96 ( Margossian and Lowey 1982 ) . The myosin obtained from the soleus muscle of rabbits is a 97 combination of > 90 % Type I ( slow myosin ; low ATPase activity ) and < 10 % Type II ( fast 98 myosin ; high ATPase activity ) ( Billeter et al . 1980 , Reiser et al . 1985 ) . This is comparable to the 99 myosin found in human cardiac ventricles which is a combination of < 10 % α - myosin heavy 100 chain ( fast ) and > 90 % β - myosin heavy chain ( slow ) ( Reiser et al . 2001 , Narolska et al . 2005 ) . 101 α - cardiac actin protein was prepared from the left ventricular muscle of bovine hearts 102 obtained from the Animal and Poultry Science Department ( Guelph , ON ) ( Spudich and Watt 103 1971 ) . Bovine α - cardiac actin was used as a control as it shares 100 % sequence identity to 104 human α - cardiac actin protein . Bovine actin concentrations were determined by measuring 105 absorbance at 290 nm using an extinction coefficient of 0 . 62 mL·mg - 1 ·cm - 1 . Other protein 106 concentrations were determined with Bio - Rad protein dye reagent employing bovine actin as the 107 standard . 108 Recombinant gelsolin and His - tagged G4 - 6 proteins were expressed and purified from 109 Escherichia coli following established protocols ( Morrison and Dawson 2007 , Ohki et al . 2009 ) . 110 Recombinant human ACTC variant proteins were expressed in Sf 21 cells with 111 recombinant baculoviruses ( Mundia et al . 2012 ) . To purify the recombinant ACTC proteins , we 112 adapted the affinity method of Ohki et al . ( 2009 ) , binding actin proteins in cell lysates to His - 113 tagged G4 - 6 in the presence of calcium and eluting the ACTC proteins in an EGTA - containing 114 buffer . Cells from a 500 mL culture were first harvested by centrifugation and lysed in Buffer A 115 ( 10 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 , 5 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM PMSF , 0 . 01 mg / mL leupeptin , 1 mM ATP , 2 mM β - 116 mercaptoethanol ) by vortexing with glass beads ( BioSpec Products ) in a 50 mL conical tube for 117 6 cycles of 1 minute vortexing followed by 4 minutes on ice . 10 mg of His - G4 - 6 was then added 118 Page 6 of 24 https : / / mc06 . manuscriptcentral . com / bcb - pubs Biochemistry and Cell Biology D r a ft 7 to the lysate and mixed at 4˚C overnight . After centrifugation at 25 , 000 rpm in a TA 25 . 50 rotor 119 ( Beckman ) for 30 minutes , the supernatant was recirculated through a 5 mL Ni - NTA column 120 ( Qiagen ) in a closed loop for 1 . 5 hours . The column was then washed with 30 mL of Buffer A 121 containing 50 mM KCl followed by 40 mL of Buffer A containing 50 mM KCl and 20 mM 122 imidazole . A 1 mL HiTrap DEAE Sepharose FF column ( GE Healthcare Life Science ) 123 equilibrated in 10 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM ATP , 0 . 125 mM PMSF , 0 . 2 mM β - 124 mercaptoethanol was attached to the bottom of the Ni - NTA column . 40 mL ACTC release buffer 125 ( 10 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 , 50 mM KCl , 0 . 2 mM EGTA , 0 . 2 mM PMSF , 0 . 5 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM 126 ATP , 2 mM β - mercaptoethanol ) was applied to release the ACTC protein from the His - tagged 127 G4 - 6 bound on the Ni - NTA column . The released ACTC protein then bound to the DEAE 128 column . After disconnecting the DEAE column , the His - tagged G4 - 6 protein was eluted from the 129 Ni - NTA column in 15 mL G4 - 6 elution buffer ( 10 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 , 50 mM KCl , 0 . 2 M 130 imidazole , pH 8 . 0 , 5 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM PMSF , 1 mM ATP , 2 mM β - mercaptoethanol ) . ACTC 131 was eluted from the DEAE column in ACTC elution buffer ( 10 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 132 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 2 mM PMSF , 0 . 2 mM β - mercaptoethanol , 0 . 3 M KCl ) . ACTC - containing 133 fractions were dialyzed into G - buffer ( 2 mM Tris pH 8 , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 5 mM ß - 134 mercaptoethanol , 0 . 002 % NaN 3 ) . Proteins were kept on ice and used within one week of 135 preparation . 10 % SDS - PAGE was used to verify the presence of pure ACTC and the progress of 136 purification . The average ACTC protein yields per 500 mL cell culture were as follows : 137 recombinant wild type ( WTrec ) , 2 . 4 ± 0 . 2 mg ( n = 22 ) ; H88Y ACTC , 4 . 3 ± 0 . 4 mg ( n = 3 ) ; F90∆ 138 ACTC , 2 . 4 ± 0 . 1 mg ( n = 3 ) ; R95C ACTC , 3 . 1 ± 0 . 3 mg ( n = 14 ) ; E99K ACTC , 2 . 3 ± 0 . 3 mg 139 ( n = 6 ) . 140 141 Page 7 of 24 https : / / mc06 . manuscriptcentral . com / bcb - pubs Biochemistry and Cell Biology D r a ft 8 ATPase Assay 142 The myosin ATPase activity assay used was a colorimetric assay based on the production 143 of a blue byproduct between released P i and molybdate , modified from Trybus ( 2000 ) for a 96 - 144 well format . ACTC was polymerized in assay buffer ( AB ) ( 75 mM KCl , 10 mM imidazole , pH 145 7 , 10 mM DTT , 1 mM EGTA , 1 mM MgCl 2 , and 1 mM NaN 3 ) , in the presence of a 1 : 1000 146 molar ratio of gelsolin to ACTC , and 2 mM Mg - ATP . Gelsolin is added to the ATPase assay to 147 reduce viscosity of high F - actin concentrations , increasing the accuracy in the experiment 148 ( Sommese et al . 2013 ) . Samples of varying actin concentrations were produced through serial 149 dilutions in AB containing 2 mM Mg - ATP and kept on ice until they were added to the reaction . 150 The ATPase assay was performed using two 96 - well plates at 22˚C . The reaction plate 151 contained concentrations of H 2 PO 4 ranging from 0 . 05 mM to 2 mM for a standard curve and 152 triplicate 100 µL samples of each ACTC concentration . Rabbit soleus muscle myosin was 153 prepared in 1X AB without ATP to a final concentration of 0 . 125 mg / mL . 100 µL of myosin was 154 added to each actin sample well to begin the ATPase reaction ( final concentration of 0 . 063 155 mg / mL or 0 . 13 umol / L ) . At 10 minute intervals for 40 min , 45 µL of each reaction mixture was 156 removed and mixed with 45 µL stop solution ( 60 mM EDTA pH 6 . 5 , 6 . 6 % SDS ) in wells of the 157 stop plate . Over the course of the assay , the ATPase rate was linear for all ATC variants ( data 158 note shown ) . The standard samples were also mixed with 45 µL stop solution . 159 After 40 min , 200 µL of a molybdate colouring solution ( 0 . 25M 2 % ammonium 160 molybdate , 5 mg / ml ferrous sulfate ) were added to the wells of the stop plate and the plate was 161 then read at 750 nm in a microplate reader . The standard curve was used to calculate the rate of 162 inorganic phosphate release in each assay . The average of the triplicate ATPase activities for 163 each concentration of actin was plotted against the concentration of actin in the assay and fit to 164 Page 8 of 24 https : / / mc06 . manuscriptcentral . com / bcb - pubs Biochemistry and Cell Biology D r a ft 9 the Michaelis - Menten curve using Prism software ( GraphPad , La Jolla , CA ) . k cat was calculated 165 by determining the myosin concentration using a myosin heavy chain mass of 486 kDa . 166 Statistical analysis was accomplished using SPSS ( IBM , Armonk , North Castle , NY ) . 167 168 In Vitro Motility Assays 169 The in vitro motility assay was adapted from Toyoshima ( 1987 ) and performed at 22˚C . 170 Active HMM was obtained by " deadheading " HMM with F - actin in the absence of ATP , co - 171 sedimentation of the acto - HMM complex , and release of active HMM in the presence of 2 mM 172 ATP . Flow cells were produced with nitrocellulose - coated coverslips and double - sided tape on 173 microscope slides where proteins were flowed in and incubated for 2 minutes for protein binding 174 and buffer exchanges . Deadheaded HMM diluted to 0 . 125 mg / mL in assay buffer was injected 175 first , followed by bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) diluted to 1 mg / mL in assay buffer to block the 176 nitrocellulose coverslip . The flow cell was then washed with assay buffer , and rhodamine 177 phalloidin - labelled ACTC protein variants ( naked and / or regulated thin filaments ) diluted to ~ 0 . 1 178 µM were bound to HMM in the nitrocellulose coverslip in the absence of ATP . 179 The flow cell was then washed with assay buffer prior to the addition of motility buffer 180 ( MB ; 25 mM KCl , 25 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 5 , 10 mM DTT , 4 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , and 2 181 mM ATP ) with an oxygen - scavenging system ( 25 ug / mL glucose oxidase , 45 ug / mL catalase , 182 and 1 % glucose ) to prevent photobleaching . The flow cell was then inverted onto a Zeiss 183 Axiovert 200M ( Zeiss , Jena , Germany ) microscope and actin proteins were visualized at 100x 184 oil - immersed magnification using the Texas Red ( 510 nm ) filter . The movement of filaments 185 was captured using a digital CCD ORCA - R2 C10600 camera ( Hamamatsu , Middlesex , NJ ) 186 Page 9 of 24 https : / / mc06 . manuscriptcentral . com / bcb - pubs Biochemistry and Cell Biology D r a ft 10 controlled by Volocity 6 . 3 software ( Perkin Elmer , Waltham , MA ) at a frame rate of 2 . 48 187 frames / second . Three movies at different locations on the nitrocellulose coverslip were captured . 188 The movement of ACTC filaments was tracked using a protocol adapted from Fraser and 189 Marston ( 1995 ) . 14 to 20 single ACTC filaments moving in a linear pattern for at least 6 frames 190 were selected in each movie . Each filament’s distance moved was tracked using Image J 1 . 47v 191 and recorded on a customized Excel spreadsheet containing input of individual filament 192 coordinates , number of pixels moved per frame , frame rate displacement , and individual filament 193 velocities . The calibration of 89 . 5 nm / pixel was used to determine the total distance moved by 194 each filament . 195 196 Results 197 ACTC Purification 198 Previously , we used DNase - I affinity chromatography to purify recombinant human 199 ACTC proteins from insect cells infected with recombinant baculoviruses ( Yates et al . 2009 , 200 Mundia et al . 2012 , Dahari and Dawson 2015 ) . Here , we used recombinant His - tagged gelsolin 201 segments 4 - 6 ( G4 - 6 ) to purify the human ACTC proteins in a calcium - dependent manner ( Ohki 202 et al . 2009 ) using a combination of Ni - NTA columns for purification and DEAE columns for 203 actin concentration . Where DNase - I affinity chromatography requires slower - flowing resin and 204 harsh elution conditions containing 50 % formamide , the method employed here uses 205 commercially available fast - flow resin and mild buffer conditions , resulting in 2 - 4 mg of protein 206 from a 500 mL insect cell culture ( Figure 1B ) . 207 208 Comparison of Tissue Purified and Recombinant ACTC 209 Page 10 of 24 https : / / mc06 . manuscriptcentral . com / bcb - pubs Biochemistry and Cell Biology D r a ft 11 To ensure that recombinant ACTC proteins purified with His - G4 - 6 protein possess the 210 same properties as tissue - purified cardiac actin , we compared actin - activated myosin ATPase 211 activity using bovine cardiac actin or recombinant WT ACTC ( WTrec ) . The resulting Michealis - 212 Menten curves were similar ( Figure 2 inset ) . Bovine cardiac actin produced a myosin ATPase 213 V max of 14 . 9 ± 1 . 0 µM P i / min and K M of 1 . 2 ± 0 . 3 µM , while WTrec ACTC had a V max of 14 . 2 ± 214 1 . 0 µM P i / min and a K M of 1 . 0 ± 0 . 4 µM . 215 216 The k cat and Duty Ratio of ACTC Variants 217 Michaelis - Menten curves for the myosin ATPase activity of each ACTC variant were 218 generated ( Figure 2A ) and their V max and K M values determined by fitting the curves to the 219 Michaelis - Menten equation . The V max for each variant was used to determine the k cat of the 220 reaction given the amount of myosin employed ( Table 1 ) . No significant differences between 221 WTrec activities were seen compared to E99K and H88Y variants ; there were significant 222 differences in comparing WTrec to F90∆ and R95C . 223 In vitro motility assays determined the sliding velocity v o of each ACTC variant over a 224 bed of HMM ( Figure 2B ) . There was a significant decrease in v o between WTrec ( v o = 1 . 99 225 um / sec ) and E99K ( v o = 1 . 25 um / sec ) , consistent with previous studies ( Debold et al . 2010 , 226 Dahari and Dawson 2015 ) . We also observed a significant increase between WTrec and F90∆ 227 ( v o = 2 . 89 um / sec ) . 228 Assuming a fixed step size of 5 nm for myosin , we then calculated the duty ratio of each 229 ACTC variant , r , and the relative myosin duty ratio with respect to WTrec ACTC , r rel ( Table 1 ) . 230 E99K had an increased relative duty ratio of 1 . 36 , consistent with our previous work ( Dahari and 231 Page 11 of 24 https : / / mc06 . manuscriptcentral . com / bcb - pubs Biochemistry and Cell Biology D r a ft 12 Dawson 2015 ) . Conversely , F90∆ , and R95C had lower relative duty ratios of 0 . 43 and 0 . 71 , 232 respectively , while H88Y had a duty ratio similar to WTrec . 233 234 Discussion 235 Previously , we characterized the intrinsic properties of several human ACTC variant 236 proteins and concluded that changes in subdomains - 1 and - 4 of actin impact protein - protein 237 interactions ( Mundia et al . 2012 ) . We then determined the myosin duty ratio for a number of 238 ACTC variants located along the surface of actin , including E99K ACTC , concluding that 239 different molecular mechanisms exist for ACTC variants leading to HCM development ( Dahari 240 and Dawson 2015 ) . In the current work , we focused specifically on the actomyosin - binding site ; 241 hypothesizing that ACTC variants in this region follow a similar dysfunctional pattern . 242 To test our hypothesis , we first purified recombinant human ACTC variant proteins 243 employing His - tagged G4 - 6 affinity chromatography ( Ohki et al . 2009 ) . We showed that tissue - 244 purified bovine ACTC protein and human WTrec protein did not exhibit any statistically 245 significant differences in myosin ATPase assays , indicating that the His - tagged G4 - 6 purification 246 method does not affect the activity of the resulting proteins . 247 We predicted that variants in the actomyosin binding site would follow the pattern of the 248 well - studied E99K ACTC variant , exhibiting an increase in myosin duty ratio ; however , our data 249 from ATPase and in vitro motility assays showed variability between the actomyosin site of 250 other ACTC variants . In ATPase assays , E99K and H88Y ACTC variants exhibited activities 251 similar to WTrec , while R95C and F90 ∆ had lower ATPase activities . In the in vitro motility 252 assays , E99K ACTC had lower sliding velocities , while R95C and F90 ∆ variants exhibited 253 higher velocities . The H88Y ACTC had a similar velocity to WTrec . Taken together , the 254 Page 12 of 24 https : / / mc06 . manuscriptcentral . com / bcb - pubs Biochemistry and Cell Biology D r a ft 13 calculated duty ratios based on a 5 nm myosin step size resulted in a duty ratio relative to WTrec 255 that was higher for E99K ACTC , consistent with our previous work ( Dahari and Dawson 2015 ) , 256 lower for R95C and F90 ∆ ACTC and similar for H88Y ACTC . 257 The hypothesis that a change in the same binding site will result in the same molecular 258 dysfunction does not account for the nature of that change . The E99K substitution results in a 259 charge - reversal at a site that is predicted to participate in a salt bridge with a counterpart amino 260 acid on myosin ( Lorenz and Holmes 2010 , Behrmann et al . 2012 ) . Rather than form a salt bridge , 261 the charge reversal would result in charge repulsion at this site . H88Y is farther from the 262 predicted actomyosin atomic interactions and is a milder substitution . It is therefore unsurprising 263 that this ACTC variant exhibits properties similar to WTrec . The R95C change results in a loss 264 of charge in a potential salt bridge with myosin , similar to E99K , but it results in the opposite 265 molecular effects . Interestingly , the complete deletion of a codon encoding amino acid 90 in 266 ACTC might result in a change in the local structure and arrangement of amino acids in the 267 actomyosin binding site and results in a similar molecular dysfunction to R95C ACTC . 268 Despite being in the same molecular location on the actin molecule , the ACTC variants 269 studied here found in patients with HCM show different effects on actomyosin duty ratio . While 270 duty ratio is an important part of the overall contributors to cardiac contractility , ACTC variants 271 might also impact the step size ( δ ) or the intrinsic force ( f ) of the actomyosin interaction 272 ( Spudich 2014 ) , resulting in changes in force production . To determine if these other parameters 273 are altered , single - molecule laser - trapping assays could be employed . 274 Our work benefits from being free of the complications of the regulatory machinery 275 found in cells ; at the same time , those forms of regulation can compensate for changes in the 276 core force production between actin and myosin . Our approach starts with the core interactions ; 277 Page 13 of 24 https : / / mc06 . manuscriptcentral . com / bcb - pubs Biochemistry and Cell Biology D r a ft 14 to gain a fuller picture , we also need to examine added layers of biological complexity involving 278 the products of other genes that are mutated in patients suffering HCM ( Maron 2013 ) , such as 279 examining regulated thin filaments in vitro or reconstituted thin filaments using sinusoidal 280 analysis ( Bai et al . 2014 , 2015 ) . Integration of data from several levels of cardiac function 281 regulation will connect molecular defects to HCM development . These connections will allow us 282 to target specific changes in individual patients , tailoring treatments and leading to longer and 283 better lives . 284 285 Acknowledgements 286 We thank Matiyo Ojehomon , Navneet Sidhu , and Jordan Meyer for technical assistance . 287 This research was supported by a grant - in - aid from the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada . 288 J .
