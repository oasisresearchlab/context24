Previous studies have shown that clathrin - mediated endocytosis of the plasma membrane ( PM ) auxin transporter PIN - FORMED1 is regulated by the extracellular auxin receptor AUXIN BINDING PROTEIN1 ( ABP1 ) . However , the mechanisms by which ABP1 and other factors regulate clathrin - mediated traf ﬁ cking are poorly understood . Here , we applied a genetic strategy and time - resolved imaging to dissect the role of clathrin light chains ( CLCs ) and ABP1 in auxin regulation of clathrin - mediated traf ﬁ cking in Arabidopsis thaliana . Auxin was found to differentially regulate the PM and trans - Golgi network / early endosome ( TGN / EE ) association of CLCs and heavy chains ( CHCs ) in an ABP1 - dependent but TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE1 / AUXIN - BINDING F - BOX PROTEIN ( TIR1 / AFB ) - independent manner . Loss of CLC2 and CLC3 affected CHC membrane association , decreased both internalization and intracellular traf ﬁ cking of PM proteins , and impaired auxin - regulated endocytosis . Consistent with these results , basipetal auxin transport , auxin sensitivity and distribution , and root gravitropism were also found to be dramatically altered in clc2 clc3 double mutants , resulting in pleiotropic defects in plant development . These results suggest that CLCs are key regulators in clathrin - mediated traf ﬁ cking downstream of ABP1 - mediated signaling and thus play a critical role in membrane traf ﬁ cking from the TGN / EE and PM during plant development . INTRODUCTION Clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) is an evolutionally con - served endocytic pathway that plays a pivotal role in the regu - lation of protein abundance at the plasma membrane ( PM ) and / or the trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) during signaling events and retargeting or degradation of membrane proteins ( Chen et al . , 2011 ; McMahon and Boucrot , 2011 ) . Clathrin is a triskelion - shaped complex consisting of three heavy chains ( CHCs ) , which form the structural backbone of the clathrin lattice , and three light chains ( CLCs ) ( Royle , 2006 ) , which have been suggested in mammalian and yeast cells to regulate the formation of clathrin - coated vesicles ( CCVs ) ( Ybe et al . , 1998 ; Newpher et al . , 2006 ; Royle , 2006 ; Mettlen et al . , 2009 ) . During CME , clathrin triskelia associate with the PM and polymerize to form clathrin - coated pits ( CCPs ) through their interaction with cargo proteins , the adaptor protein 2 complex ( composed of a , b 2 , m 2 , and s 2 subunits ) and accessory adaptor proteins , such as clathrin as - sembly protein AP180 and Epsin ( Royle , 2006 ) . CCPs harboring cargoes initiate , invaginate , and eventually mature as CCVs through pinching off the PM . In plants , clathrin - dependent membrane traf ﬁ cking is critical for a number of developmental processes , including the de - termination of cell polarity ( Dhonukshe et al . , 2008 ; Mravec et al . , 2011 ) , cytokinesis ( Kang et al . , 2003 ; Van Damme et al . , 2011 ) , cell elongation ( Zhao et al . , 2010 ) , embryogenesis ( Kitakura et al . , 2011 ) , and gametogenesis ( Backues et al . , 2010 ) . Plant CLCs and CHCs predominantly localize to the PM and TGN / early endosome ( EE ) compartments ( Dhonukshe et al . , 2007 ; Konopka et al . , 2008 ; Robert et al . , 2010 ; Ito et al . , 2012 ) , and CME regu - lates the internalization of critical PM proteins involved in hor - mone signaling ( Geldner et al . , 2007 ; Robert et al . , 2010 ; Xu et al . , 2010 ; Irani et al . , 2012 ) , defense or stress responses ( Leborgne - Castel et al . , 2008 ) , and nutrient uptake ( Barberon et al . , 2011 ) . Auxin regulates many aspects of plant growth and de - velopment , such as root and shoot architecture , organ pattern formation , and vascular development , as well as responses to gravity and light ( Leyser , 2011 ) . The direction and ﬂ ux of auxin within the plant and its intracellular accumulation are largely determined by the PM polar localization of auxin transporters , AUXIN RESISTANT1 / LIKE AUX proteins ( Swarup et al . , 2005 ) , ABC - type MULTIDRUG RESISTANCE / P - GLYCOPROTEINS ( Geisler and Murphy , 2006 ; Blakeslee et al . , 2007 ; Titapiwatanakun et al . , 2009 ) , and PIN - FORMED ( PIN ) proteins ( Petrá š ek et al . , 2006 ; Wisniewska et al . , 2006 ) .

Consistent with a role for CME in PIN localization and function , recent analysis of loss - of - function chc2 single mutants and transgenic lines expressing a dominant - negative form of CHC1 ( HUB ) ( Kitakura et al . , 2011 ) has demonstrated that CHCs are required for the endocytosis and polar distribution of PIN proteins and play a critical role in plant developmental processes . Auxin itself modulates the levels and distribution of PIN pro - teins through TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE1 / AUXIN - BINDING F - BOX PROTEIN ( TIR1 / AFB ) - mediated regulation of PIN transcription and degradation ( Sieberer et al . , 2000 ; Vieten et al . , 2005 ; Sauer et al . , 2006a ; Pan et al . , 2009 ; Sun et al . , 2011 ; Baster et al . , 2012 ) . In addition , auxin inhibits CME of PIN pro - teins via a rapid depletion of both CLCs and CHCs from the PM , which requires AUXIN BINDING PROTEIN1 ( ABP1 ) - mediated auxin signaling ( Robert et al . , 2010 ; Sauer and Kleine - Vehn , 2011 ) . However , little is known about molecular mechanisms underlying auxin / ABP1 regulation of PM - and TGN / EE - associated CLC or CHC levels and their function during membrane traf ﬁ cking . Furthermore , the speci ﬁ c biochemical processes in which CLCs function during membrane traf ﬁ cking are not well understood in any system , and their physiological and developmental roles in plants remain to be elucidated . In this study , we used genetic and cytological approaches to dissect the roles of CLCs in clathrin - mediated traf ﬁ cking and their function in plant growth and development . Our results demon - strate that CLCs regulate the membrane association of CHCs and auxin - dependent clathrin - mediated traf ﬁ cking from the PM and TGN / EE downstream of ABP1 - mediated signaling . RESULTS Auxin Differentially Regulates CLC and CHC Association with the Membranes Bioinformatic analyses have identi ﬁ ed two CHC and three CLC genes ( CLC1 - 3 ) in the Arabidopsis thaliana genome ( Holstein , 2002 ; Chen et al . , 2011 ) . CLC1 - 3 share ; 55 % amino acid identity with each other and ; 30 % identity with either mammalian CLCa or CLCb isoforms . Previous studies have demonstrated that CLC2 - GFP ( for green ﬂ uorescent protein ) localizes to the TGN / EE and to dynamic PM - associated foci ( Konopka et al . , 2008 ; Ito et al . , 2012 ) , and upon auxin treatment , the levels of CLC2 - GFP transiently disappear from the PM but remain constant at the TGN / EE ( Robert et al . , 2010 ) . To further assess the regulation and role of CLCs in auxin - dependent CME , we ﬁ rst reevaluated the effects of auxin on the localization and membrane association of CLCs . Five - day - old seedlings that express CLC2 - GFP under control of its native promoter ( ProCLC2 : CLC2 - GFP ) ( Konopka et al . , 2008 ; Ito et al . , 2012 ) were treated with exogenous auxin 2 , 4 - dichlorophenoxyacetic acid ( 2 , 4 - D ; 10 µ M ) for different lengths of time and the levels of PM - and TGN / EE - associated CLC2 - GFP were analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy ( CLSM ) . As previously reported ( Robert et al . , 2010 ) , the levels of PM - associated CLC2 - GFP in root epidermal cells transiently decreased after treatment with auxin for 5 min and re - appeared at the PM after 60 to 120 min ( see Supplemental Figures 1C to 1F and 1M online ) . No signi ﬁ cant changes in the levels of PM - associated CLC2 - GFP were detected in the different time mock controls ( see Supplemental Figures 1A , 1B , and 1M online ) . However , in contrast with the results of Robert et al . ( 2010 ) , the association of CLC2 - GFP with the TGN / EE paralleled the auxin - stimulated loss , followed by recovery of the PM pool of CLC2 - GFP ( see Supplemental Figures 1A to 1F and 1M online ) . Similarly , analyses of the subcellular distribution of endogenous CLC1 in wild - type root epidermal cells by immuno ﬂ uorescence ( IF ) microscopy using af ﬁ nity - puri ﬁ ed anti - CLC1 – speci ﬁ c antibodies ( Figures 1A to 1F and 1M ) and live - cell imaging of CLC1 - GFP expressed under control of the con - stitutive cauli ﬂ ower mosaic virus 35S promoter ( see Supplemental Figures 1G to 1L and 1N online ) showed that the PM and TGN / EE association of the CLC1 isoform was also regulated by exogenous auxin . Furthermore , the levels of PM - and TGN / EE - associated endogenous CLC1 ( Figure 1 ) and the CLC1 - GFP and CLC2 - GFP fusion proteins ( see Supplemental Figure 1 online ) displayed similar kinetic pro ﬁ les in terms of their transient loss after 5 to 30 min and subsequent recovery after 120 min in response to exogenous auxin treatment . In yeast and animal cells , CLCs and CHCs assemble to form clathrin triskelia in vivo ( McMahon and Boucrot , 2011 ) . Therefore , we tested the effects of auxin on the levels of membrane - associated CHCs by IF microscopy using af ﬁ nity - puri ﬁ ed anti - CHC – speci ﬁ c antibodies . Surprisingly , in contrast with CLCs , the levels of PM - and TGN / EE - associated CHCs appeared to initially increase after auxin treatments for 5 and 30 min ( Figures 1G to 1J ) . The intensity of the CHC signal at the PM and TGN / EE increased by ; 50 % relative to the mock controls ( Figure 1N ) . However , after 60 min , the levels of PM - and TGN / EE - associated CHCs were found to signi ﬁ cantly de - crease in auxin - treated seedlings ( Figures 1K , 1L , and 1N ) . Immu - noblot analysis of microsomal membrane fractions from the whole wild - type seedlings in the presence or absence of exogenous auxin con ﬁ rmed that the levels of membrane - associated CLC1 and CLC2 initially decreased , whereas CHC levels increased 30 min after 2 , 4 - D addition relative to those in mock - treated seedlings ( see Supplemental Figure 2A , lanes 1 and 2 , online ) . Subsequently , the levels of membrane - associated CLC1 and CLC2 returned to wild - type levels , whereas CHC levels decreased 120 min after 2 , 4 - D addition ( see Supplemental Figure 2B , lanes 1 and 2 , online ) , con - sistent with CLSM analysis of CLC and CHC subcellular localization in root epidermal cells ( Figure 1 ; see Supplemental Figure 1 online ) . The differential effects of the auxin , 2 , 4 - D on the levels of PM - and TGN / EE - associated CHCs and CLC1 - GFP were shown to be coordinated within individual cells expressing endogenous CHCs and CLC1 - GFP ( see Supplemental Figure 3 online ) . 2 , 4 - D is a synthetic auxin and we therefore examined the effects of natural and other synthetic auxin analogs on the PM and TGN / EE association of clathrin subunits . Similar to the ef - fects of 2 , 4 - D , naphthalene - 1 - acetic acid ( 1 - NAA ; 10 m M ) and the natural auxin indole - 3 - acetic acid ( IAA ; 20 m M ) were found to differentially affect the PM and TGN / EE association of CLC1 and CHCs ( see Supplemental Figures 4A to 4N online ) . Con - versely , a structural analog of 1 - NAA , naphthalene - 2 - acetic acid ( 2 - NAA ; 20 m M ) , which has no biological auxin activity , 2 of 18 The Plant Cell and 5 - ﬂ uoroindole - 3 - acetic acid ( 5 - F - IAA ; 20 m M ) , which promotes auxin - dependent gene transcription but does not inhibit PIN1 internalization ( Robert et al . , 2010 ) , had no affect on the subcellular distribution of CLC1 - GFP and CHCs ( see Supplemental Figures 4O to 4Z 3 online ) . These data further support our ﬁ nding that auxin differentially regulates membrane association of CLCs and CHCs in plants . Effects of Cycloheximide and MG132 on CLC and CHC Association with Membranes Based upon our analysis of the effects of 2 , 4 - D on the PM - and TGN / EE - associated CLC1 - GFP levels ( see Supplemental Figure 1 online ) , which is expressed under the auxin - independent transcriptional control of the cauli ﬂ ower mosaic virus 35S pro - moter ( Liu et al . , 1994 ) and the lack of any effect by 5 - F - IAA ( see Supplemental Figure 4 online ) , we hypothesized that the initial auxin - dependent changes in the CLC and CHC membrane as - sociation would be mediated through posttranscriptional pro - cesses . Indeed , using quantitative real - time RT - PCR analysis , we detected no signi ﬁ cant differences between the levels of CLCs and CHCs mRNA in mock - treated versus 2 , 4 - D – treated seedlings for 30 and 120 min ( see Supplemental Figure 5A and Supplemental Table 1 online ) . Similarly , the effects of auxin on the initial changes in CLC and CHC association with the PM and TGN / EE were not blocked by cycloheximide ( CHX ; 50 µ M ) , Figure 1 .

As shown by CLSM imaging , CHX or MG132 alone treatment for 30 min did not signi ﬁ cantly affect the levels of PM - and TGN / EE - associated CLC1 - GFP and CHCs ( see Supplemental Figures 6G and 6N online ) . However , de novo protein synthesis was required for the observed restoration ( 120 min ) , following the transient auxin - stimulated reduction , of membrane - associated CLC levels . As shown in Supplemental Figure 6 online , CHX , but not MG132 , inhibited the reappearance of CLC1 - GFP at the PM and TGN / EE in the presence of 2 , 4 - D ( see Supplemental Figures 6R to 6U online ) and was restored to wild - type levels upon CHX washout ( see Supplemental Figures 6S , inset , and 6U online ) . Similarly , immunoblot analysis showed that the levels of membrane - associated CLC1 and CLC2 were reduced in seedlings treated with CHX and 2 , 4 - D but not with MG132 and 2 , 4 - D , relative to seedlings treated solely with 2 , 4 - D for 120 min ( see Supplemental Figure 2B , lanes 2 to 4 , online ) . Conversely , as shown by CLSM imaging and immunoblot analysis , MG132 , but not CHX , inhibited the loss of PM - and TGN / EE - associated CHCs after 120 - min treatments with 2 , 4 - D ( see Supplemental Figures 6Z 1 to 6Z 3 and 2B , lanes 3 and 4 , online ) , suggesting that auxin - mediated loss of membrane - associated CHCs is dependent on proteasome - mediated protein degradation . As shown by CLSM imaging , CHX treatment , but not MG132 alone , for 120 min slightly but signi ﬁ cantly decreased the levels of PM - and TGN / EE - associated CLC1 - GFP and CHCs ( see Supplemental Figures 6U and 6Z 3 online ) . Differential Auxin Regulation of CLC and CHC Membrane Association Is Dependent on ABP1 but Not TIR1 / AFB Signaling To determine whether the differential auxin - regulated PM and TGN / EE association of CLCs and CHCs is dependent upon ABP1 and / or E3 ubiquitin ligase SCF TIR1 / AFB , we examined the kinetics of auxin effects on CLC and CHC membrane localization in various auxin - signaling mutants by IF microscopy and immu - noblot analysis . As in the wild type , auxin differentially regulated the PM and TGN / EE association of CLC1 and CHCs in tir1 afb1 , 2 , 3 ( see Supplemental Figures 7A to 7J online ) , a nuclear - localized auxin receptor quadruple mutant ( Dharmasiri et al . , 2005 ) . Similar results were observed in axr1 - 12 , a ubiquitin - activating enzyme E1 mutant ( Leyser et al . , 1993 ) , and axr6 - 3 , a SCF subunit CUL1 mutant ( Quint et al . , 2005 ) ( see Supplemental Figures 7K to 7T online ) , suggesting that SCF TIR1 / AFB - mediated auxin signaling is not directly involved in the differential auxin regulation of CLC and CHC membrane association . As shown in Figure 2 , the auxin - mediated transient depletion and increase in the membrane as - sociation of CLC1 and CHCs , respectively , were abolished in abp1 - 5 mutants that contain an amino acid substitution ( H94Y ) in the ABP1 potential auxin binding site ( Robert et al . , 2010 ; Xu et al . , 2010 ) and the supposed ABP1 gain - of - function GFP - ABP1 D KDEL transgenic lines ( Robert et al . , 2010 ) . It is likely that the lack of KDEL , an endoplasmic reticulum C - terminal tetra - peptide retention signal , reduces auxin - signaling function of GFP - APB1 D KDEL through disrupting its subcellular localization . In the absence of exogenous auxin , the levels of PM - and TGN - associated CLC1 and CHCs were similar to the wild type in these auxin - signaling mutants examined ( see Supplemental Figures 8A to 8E , 8G to 8K , 8M , and 8N online ) with the exception that in - creased levels of membrane - associated CLC1 and CHCs were observed in GFP - ABP1 D KDEL transgenic lines , compared with wild - type mock controls ( Figures 2O and 2T ) , consistent with the model that in the absence of auxin , ABP1 plays a positive role in endocytosis ( Robert et al . , 2010 ) and potentially clathrin - dependent traf ﬁ cking from the TGN / EE . In addition , immunoblot analysis further con ﬁ rmed that auxin differentially affected the levels of membrane - associated CLC2 and CHCs in axr1 - 12 and axr6 - 3 mutant seedling membrane fractions similarly to in the wild type , whereas there was no observed transient decrease of CLC2 ( 30 min ) or loss of CHCs ( 120 min ) in auxin - treated abp1 - 5 mutants ( see Supplemental Figures 2C and 2D online ) . Moreover , in the absence of exog - enous auxin , the levels of membrane - associated CLC2 , CLC1 , and CHCs in axr - 12 , axr6 - 3 , and abp1 - 5 mutants were similar to those in the wild type ( see Supplemental Figures 2E and 2F online ) . Together , these results suggest that the differential auxin regulation of CLC and CHC membrane association is de - pendent on ABP1 - mediated , but not TIR1 / AFB - mediated , auxin signaling . clc Mutants Display Pleiotropic Developmental Defects To explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the ob - served differential effects of auxin on the membrane associ - ation of CLCs and CHCs , we identi ﬁ ed mutant lines containing T - DNA insertions in the three genes encoding CLC1 , 2 , and 3 ( see Supplemental Figures 9A to 9C online ) . Homozygous clc1 - 1 mutants could not be obtained as clc1 - 1 pollen was not viable , and their further characterization will be reported elsewhere . In contrast with clc1 mutants , single homozygous clc2 - 1 and clc3 - 1 as well as double homozygous clc2 - 1 clc3 - 1 mutant seedlings were found to be viable . However , these mutants dis - played numerous developmental defects . As shown in Figures 3A to 3C , 5 - d - old clc2 - 1 and clc3 - 1 seedlings have shorter primary roots and longer hypocotyls relative to the wild type . This phe - notype was signi ﬁ cantly enhanced in the clc2 - 1 clc3 - 1 double mutant seedlings relative to either their single mutants or the wild type , suggesting that CLC2 and CLC3 are functionally redundant . In addition , 3 - week - old double mutants exhibited up - curled leaves with longer petioles and fewer trichomes relative to the wild type ( Figures 3D to 3H ) , phenotypes that were not observed in the single mutant plants . In the ﬂ owering double mutant plants , the in ﬂ orescence stems were more highly branched and prostrate with shorter siliques than the wild type ( Figures 3I to 3K ) . In ad - dition , root hair polarity ( Grebe et al . , 2002 ) and the initiation of lateral root primordia ( LRP ) ( Benková et al . , 2003 ) were altered in the double mutants ( Figures 3L and 3M ; see Supplemental Figures 9D to 9F online ) . These phenotypes are characteristic of defects in auxin signaling and / or transport and indicate that Clathrin - Mediated Traf ﬁ cking in Plants 5 of 18 Figure 3 .

To con ﬁ rm that these developmental defects are speci ﬁ c to the T - DNA insertional mutations in clc2 - 1 and clc3 - 1 , we gen - erated transgenic homozygous clc2 clc3 double mutants that expressed rescue constructs for both CLC2 and CLC3 under control of their native promoters ( clc2 clc3 : : CLC2 CLC3 ) . As shown in Supplemental Figures 9G to 9I online , the clc2 clc3 : : CLC2 CLC3 rescue lines displayed phenotypically wild - type growth and development with no discernible auxin - related defects . CLCs Regulate Clathrin - Mediated Traf ﬁ cking and CHC Membrane Association To determine whether CLCs regulate general CME and / or en - docytic traf ﬁ cking , we ﬁ rst analyzed the internalization in the clc2 clc3 double mutants of GFP fusions of two PM marker proteins that have distinct functions , the auxin ef ﬂ ux transporter PIN2 ( PIN2 - GFP ; Xu and Scheres , 2005 ) and the rare cold - inducible protein RCI2A ( RCI2 - GFP ; Cutler et al . , 2000 ) , which may function in response to abiotic stress ( Medina et al . , 2007 ) . Previous studies have demonstrated that the internalization of FM4 - 64 ( N - ( 3 - triethylammoniumpropyl ] - 4 [ 6 - ( 4 - ( diethylamino ) phe - nyl ) hexatrienyl ] pyridinium dibromide ) , a lipophilic styryl dye and PIN2 is dependent on CME ( Dhonukshe et al . , 2007 ) and is reg - ulated by auxin / ABP1 ( Paciorek et al . , 2005 ; Robert et al . , 2010 ) . To con ﬁ rm that internalization of PM - localized RCI2A - GFP is also clathrin dependent , we examined the effects of tyrphostin A23 , an inhibitor of CME , and its structural analog , tyrphostin A51 , which does not affect CME ( Banbury et al . , 2003 ; Dhonukshe et al . , 2007 ; Konopka et al . , 2008 ) , on RCI2A - GFP internalization , in the presence of the vesicle traf ﬁ cking inhibitor Brefeldin A ( BFA ; 50 m M ) , which induces the clustering of late secretory pathway compartments into BFA bodies ( Geldner et al . , 2001 , 2003 ; Lam et al . , 2009 ) and thereby inhibits the recycling and / or transport of endocytosed proteins to the PM and / or vacuoles . As shown in Supplemental Figures 10A to 10D online , tyrphostin A23 ( 30 m M ) was found to signi ﬁ cantly inhibit the intracellular accumulation of RCI2A - GFP in BFA bodies , whereas tyrphostin A51 ( 30 m M ) did not affect RCI2A - GFP internalization . Together , these results in - dicate that PM - localized RCI2A - GFP is internalized via CME . To examine whether CME is affected in clc2 clc3 double mu - tants , we assessed the accumulation of PIN2 - GFP and RCI2A - GFP in BFA bodies and the internalization of FM4 - 64 . We found that the densities of PIN2 - GFP – and RCI2A - GFP – labeled BFA bodies ( 15 - min BFA treatment ; Figures 4B and 4D ; see Supplemental Figures 10F and 10H online ) and levels of in - ternalized FM4 - 64 after 30 min ( see Supplemental Figures 11A to 11C online ) in the double mutants were signi ﬁ cantly lower than observed in wild - type cells , indicating impaired CME of PM proteins in the double mutants . However , no signi ﬁ cant difference in the densities of PIN2 - GFP – and RCI2A - GFP – labeled BFA bodies was detected between the wild type and the double mutants after BFA treatment for 60 min ( Figures 4C and 4D ; see Supplemental Figures 10G and 10H online ) . One potential reason for the difference between the number of GFP - labeled BFA bodies at the early and later time points is that the inhibition of internalization by the loss of CLC2 and CLC3 is not complete in the double mutants . Due to the observed reduction in PM protein internalization at early time points , we expected that the levels of PIN2 - GFP at the PM would be elevated in the clc2 clc3 double mutant root cells compared with the wild - type . Indeed , quantita - tive image analysis of seedling roots , treated with CHX to block the synthesis of new PIN2 - GFP , showed that the PM levels of PIN2 - GFP were higher in the double mutants than in the wild type in the absence of exogenous auxin ( see Supplemental Figures 11D to 11F online ) . Together , these results suggest that inter - nalization of PM proteins is impaired in the clc2 clc3 double mutants . Following internalization , PM proteins may be transported to vacuoles for degradation or be recycled back to the PM ( Lam et al . , 2007 ; Kleine - Vehn et al . , 2008 ; Laxmi et al . , 2008 ) . Pre - vious studies in plants have shown that the accumulation of internalized GFP - fused PM proteins in vacuoles can be visual - ized in light - grown seedlings following their incubation in the dark ( Kleine - Vehn et al . , 2008 ; Laxmi et al . , 2008 ) . The vacuolar accumulation of PIN2 - GFP and RCI2A - GFP was signi ﬁ cantly reduced in the clc2 - 1 clc3 - 1 double mutants relative to the wild type after 2 - or 4 - h dark treatments ( Figures 4E to 4H ; see Supplemental Figures 10I to 10L online ) . To examine whether the recycling of internalized PIN2 - GFP and RCI2A - GFP to the PM is also affected in the double mutants , we monitored , as previously described ( Geldner et al . , 2001 , 2003 ) , the loss of internalized PIN2 - GFP and RCI2A - GFP from BFA bodies fol - lowing BFA removal in the presence of CHX . As expected , the recycling back to the PM of internalized PIN2 - GFP and RCI2A - GFP was slower in the double mutants than in the wild type ( Figures 4I to 4U ; see Supplemental Figures 10M to 10Y online ) . To address the mechanism of the impaired internalization and intracellular traf ﬁ cking of PM proteins observed in the clc2 clc3 double mutants , we examined whether the loss of CLC2 and CLC3 affected the levels of PM - and TGN / EE - associated CLC1 and CHCs in the absence of exogenous auxin . As expected , the levels of PM - and TGN / EE - associated CHCs but not CLC1 were signi ﬁ cantly reduced in the clc2 - 1 clc3 - 1 mutant cells relative to wild - type cells ( see Supplemental Figures 8F and 8L to 8N on - line ) , which was further supported by immunoblot analysis ( see Supplemental Figure 2F online ) . Taken together , these results suggest that CLCs are required for the association of CHCs with the PM and TGN / EE necessary for clathrin - mediated traf ﬁ cking . CLC - Mediated Auxin Regulation of CHC Membrane Abundance Next , we examined whether CLC2 and CLC3 are required for the observed differential auxin regulation of membrane - associated CLC1 and CHC levels . Similar to the wild type ( Figures 1A to 1F ) , CLC1 was rapidly and transiently depleted from the PM and TGN / EE upon treatment of the clc2 - 1 clc3 - 1 double mutants with exogenous auxin ( Figures 5A to 5E ) , indicating that CLC2 and CLC3 are not required for auxin regulation of CLC1 membrane association . However , in contrast with the wild - type ( Figures 1G to 1L ) , CHC levels at the PM and TGN / EE were not signi ﬁ cantly affected in the auxin - treated clc2 - 1 clc3 - 1 mutant seedlings ( Figures 5F to 5J ) , which was supported by immunoblot Clathrin - Mediated Traf ﬁ cking in Plants 7 of 18 Figure 4 .

Furthermore , the qRT - PCR analysis showed that the levels of CHC1 / 2 mRNA expression in the clc2 - 1 clc3 - 1 mutant seedlings were similar to those in the wild type with or without the application of exogenous auxin ( see Supplemental Figure 5 online ) . These results suggest that CLC2 and CLC3 mediate auxin regulation of CHC membrane abundance . To address the reciprocal question , whether CHCs are es - sential for auxin regulation of membrane - associated CLC levels , we examined the auxin effects on CLC membrane abundance in chc2 single mutants , which show signi ﬁ cant phenotypic alterations in growth and development ( Kitakura et al . , 2011 ) . In the chc2 mutants ( Figures 5K to 5O ) , auxin was found to regulate the levels of PM - and TGN / EE - associated CLC1 in the same manner as in the wild type ( Figure 1 ) as well as in clc2 - 1 clc3 - 1 ( Figures 5A to 5E ) , indicating that CHC2 is not required for auxin regulation of CLC1 membrane abundance . CLCs Are Essential for Auxin Inhibition of CME As previously described , auxin inhibits the endocytosis of PIN proteins ( Paciorek et al . , 2005 ; Pan et al . , 2009 ; Robert et al . 2010 ) as well as other PM - localized proteins , including RCI2A - GFP ( see Supplemental Figure 12 online ) .

Triple asterisks indicate P < 0 . 0001 , respectively ( Student ’ s t test ) . Clathrin - Mediated Traf ﬁ cking in Plants 9 of 18 CLCs in auxin inhibition of PM protein internalization , we ana - lyzed the uptake of PIN2 - GFP and endogenous PIN2 by live - cell and IF microscopy using af ﬁ nity - puri ﬁ ed anti - PIN2 – speci ﬁ c antibodies , respectively , in the clc2 clc3 double mutants treated with or without auxin . In the absence of exogenous auxin , the PM polar localization of PIN2 - GFP and PIN2 was indistinguishable between the wild type and the double mutants ( Figures 6A and 6F ) , indicating that CLC2 and CLC3 are not essential for the establishment and maintenance of PIN2 polarity in the root epidermal cells . BFA treatments , in the presence or absence of CHX , showed no signi ﬁ cant difference in the number of PIN2 - GFP – or PIN2 - labeled BFA bodies was observed between the wild type and the double mutants ( Figures 6B , 6E , 6G , and 6I ) , consistent with the previous observation ( Figures 4C and 4D ) . Interestingly , in the presence of 10 µ M 2 , 4 - D ( or 20 µ M IAA ) , the number of PIN2 - GFP – or PIN2 - labeled BFA bodies in the double mutants was signi ﬁ cantly higher than that in the wild type ( Figures 6C to 6E , 6H , and 6I ) , re ﬂ ecting that loss of CLC2 and CLC3 reduces the auxin inhibitory effect on PIN2 endo - cytosis . By contrast , auxin - mediated inhibition of PIN2 endo - cytosis was restored to the wild - type levels in the clc2 clc3 : : CLC2 CLC3 rescue lines ( Figures 6F to 6I ) . In the absence of BFA but in the presence of CHX , auxin effectively promoted an elevation in the levels of PM - associated PIN2 - GFP in the wild type but not in the double mutants ( see Supplemental Figures 11D to 11F online ) . These results demonstrate that CLC2 and CLC3 are essential for auxin regulation of PIN2 endocytosis . To rule out the possibility that PIN2 - GFP accumulation in BFA bodies in the auxin - treated clc2 clc3 double mutant seedlings is due to the inhibitory effect of high BFA levels ( 50 µ M ) on the PIN2 - GFP degradation , low BFA concentrations ( 25 µ M ) were used to examine internalization of PM - localized proteins . Indeed , auxin did not ef ﬁ ciently block internalization of PIN2 - GFP , PIN1 - GFP ( Heisler et al . , 2005 ) , PIN3 - GFP ( Blilou et al . , 2005 ) , PIN7 - GFP ( Blilou et al . , 2005 ) , and RCI2A - GFP in the double mutants in the presence of 25 µ M BFA and CHX ( see Supplemental Figure 13 online ) . Together , these results suggest that CLCs are essential for auxin ﬁ ne regulation of CME . Defects in Auxin Sensitivity , Auxin Transport , and Gravitropism in clc2 clc3 Mutants Primary root growth of the heterozygous abp1 / ABP1 insertional mutants is resistant to exogenously applied auxin ( Effendi et al . , 2011 ) , indicating that impairment of ABP1 - mediated auxin sig - naling decreases auxin sensitivity . Our hypothesis based on the data presented above ( Figures 1 , 2 , 5 , and 6 ; see Supplemental Figures 2 and 7 online ) is that CLC2 and CLC3 likely function in ABP1 - mediated auxin signaling . To test this , we examined whether clc2 - 1 clc3 - 1 double mutant root growth would be similarly resistant to exogenous auxin as observed for abp1 / ABP1 roots . Indeed , the double mutant root growth was signi ﬁ - cantly more resistant to 2 , 4 - D at the concentrations of 0 . 05 and 0 . 1 µ M relative to the wild - type roots ( P < 0 . 01 ; Student ’ s t test ) ( Figure 7A ) . The growth of plant roots in response to gravity is ﬁ nely and rapidly tuned via basipetal auxin transport that leads to an asymmetric distribution of auxin across the root tip ( Rashotte et al . , 2000 ; Abas et al . , 2006 ) , and PIN2 plays a pivotal role in this process ( Shin et al . , 2005 ; Abas et al . , 2006 ) . Thus , we predicted that altered PIN2 traf ﬁ cking in the clc2 clc3 double mutants ( Figures 4 and 6 ) would affect PIN2 - mediated basipetal auxin transport . We thus measured the root basipetal auxin transport in the wild type and the double mutants . As shown in Figure 7B , the root basipetal transport of tritium - labeled IAA ( 3 H - IAA ) was increased by ; 35 % in the double mutants relative to that in the wild type , suggesting that CLCs play a inhibitory role in the PIN2 - mediated basipetal auxin transport in planta . As root basipetal auxin transport is critical for gravitropism ( Rashotte et al . , 2000 ) , we next examined whether root gravi - tropic responses and auxin asymmetric distribution were altered in the double mutants . As expected , the roots of the clc2 - 1 clc3 - 1 double mutant seedlings were defective in the gravitropic re - sponse ( Figure 7C ) . In addition , expression of DR5 : GFP , a reporter for auxin distribution ( Benková et al . , 2003 ) , was found to be altered in the gravistimulated clc2 - 1 clc3 - 1 roots . In contrast with the asymmetric distribution of DR5 : GFP expression in gravi - stimulated wild - type roots , the clc2 - 1 clc3 - 1 double mutant roots showed impaired auxin redistribution ( Figures 7D to 7G ) . Together , our data demonstrate that CLC2 and CLC3 participate in the root gravitropism through the regulation of PIN2 - mediated basipetal auxin transport and auxin asymmetric distribution . DISCUSSION Mechanisms of Differential Auxin Regulation of CLCs and CHCs Clathrin - dependent membrane traf ﬁ cking is essential for many aspects of plant growth and development ( Holstein , 2002 ; Robert et al . , 2010 ; Xu et al . , 2010 ; Chen et al . , 2011 ; Sauer and Kleine - Vehn , 2011 ) . In contrast with yeast and animal cells ( McMahon and Boucrot , 2011 ) , however , the evolutionarily conserved as well as plant - speci ﬁ c mechanisms that regulate the formation and traf ﬁ cking of CCVs are not well understood . Recent studies have demonstrated that auxin transport and signaling are highly dependent on CME for the PM polar local - ization of auxin ef ﬂ ux transporters , PINs , and that CME of PINs is itself regulated by auxin and ABP1 ( Robert et al . , 2010 ; Xu et al . , 2010 ) . Our time - resolved analysis of auxin effects on clathrin - mediated traf ﬁ cking has both con ﬁ rmed that ABP1 regulates CME in an auxin - dependent manner and provided further mechanistic insight into clathrin - mediated traf ﬁ cking in plant cells . Speci ﬁ cally , our ﬁ ndings show that auxin promotes the differential association of CLCs and CHCs with the PM and TGN / EE . Interestingly , exogenous auxin was found to transiently enhance the levels of membrane - associated CHCs , while the levels of membrane - associated CLCs and the internalization of PIN and other PM proteins decreased ( Figures 1 and 6 ; see Supplemental Figures 1 to 3 and 13 online ) . By contrast , how - ever , the loss - of - function clc2 clc3 mutants showed overall re - duced levels of PM - and TGN / EE - associated CHCs relative to the wild type ( see Supplemental Figures 2 and 8 online ) . How can we resolve these seemingly contradictory observations ? 10 of 18 The Plant Cell Previous genetic and biochemical studies in yeast and ani - mals have shown that CLCs contribute to the stability and tri - merization of CHCs ( Huang et al . , 1997 ; Ybe et al . , 2007 ) . For example , the loss - of - function clc1 yeast mutants show a dra - matic reduction in the steady state levels of CHC ( Chu et al . , 1996 ; Huang et al . , 1997 ) , indicating that CLCs are essential for assembly and / or membrane association of CHCs . Depletion of CLCs in vitro and in vivo has also been shown to promote the spontaneous assembly and PM association of CHCs in animal cells ( Liu et al . , 1995 , 1998 ) . In addition , clathrin lattice assembly during the formation of CCPs is promoted via CLC - mediated CHC conformational changes ( Wilbur et al . , 2010 ) and through the interaction of CLCs with the endocytic actin binding protein , HIP - 1 ( Wilbur et al . , 2008 ; Boettner et al . , 2011 ) . Thus , it is likely that CLCs possess multiple regulatory roles in the formation and disassembly of clathrin complexes in yeast and animal cells ( Brodsky et al . , 1991 ; Ybe et al . , 1998 , 2007 ) . Our results sug - gest that plant CLCs play a similarly complex and signi ﬁ cant role Figure 6 . Impaired Auxin Inhibition of PIN2 Internalization in clc2 - 1 clc3 - 1 .

Clathrin - Mediated Traf ﬁ cking in Plants 11 of 18 in the regulation of assembly and / or membrane association of CHC triskelia in plants . Future studies are required to elucidate how CLCs are involved in regulating CHC membrane abun - dance and function in clathrin - mediated traf ﬁ cking from the PM and / or TGN / EE in plants . Although the general processes of clathrin - mediated traf - ﬁ cking are likely to be evolutionally conserved in all eukaryotes ( Holstein , 2002 ; Konopka et al . , 2008 ; Chen et al . , 2011 ; McMahon and Boucrot , 2011 ) , the regulation of clathrin - mediated traf ﬁ cking by auxin appears to be plant speci ﬁ c ( Robert et al . , 2010 ) . In wild - type Arabidopsis cells , which express three CLC isoforms , it is likely that the auxin - induced transient de - pletion of all CLCs causes a rapid change in the composition of clathrin triskelia , leading to transiently enhanced membrane association of CHCs ( Figure 1 ; see Supplemental Figures 1 and 2 online ) and a rapid inhibition of CME ( see Supplemental Figure 12 online ) . In the clc2 clc3 mutants , which constitutively lack CLC2 and CLC3 , but express CLC1 ( Figure 5 ; see Supplemental Figure 5 online ) , the long - term steady state levels of clathrin triskelia and / or stoichiometry of CHC and CLC subunits are likely altered , leading to impaired clathrin - mediated traf ﬁ cking and auxin inhibition ( Figures 4 and 6 ; see Supplemental Figures 10 to 13 online ) . The effects of transient depletion of three CLCs isoforms from the PM and TGN / EE by auxin in the wild type versus the long - term loss of CLC2 and CLC3 in the clc2 clc3 double mutants may lead to the observed differences in PM protein internalization and CHC membrane association ( Figures 1 and 4 to 6 ; see Supplemental Figures 2 , 8 , 10 , and 13 online ) . Interestingly , we observed that auxin inhibitory effects on internalization of PM proteins in the clc2 clc3 double mutants were signi ﬁ cantly reduced relative to the wild type ( Figure 6 ) . Whether this is due to an alteration in the subunit composition of clathrin triskelia or misregulation of potentially a clathrin - independent internalization pathway in the clc2 clc3 double mutant will require further experimentation , including the analysis of viable mutant lines in which all three CLC isoforms can be depleted .

Bar = 50 µ m . 12 of 18 The Plant Cell Pharmacological experiments ( see Supplemental Figures 2 and 6 online ) revealed that the auxin - stimulated transient membrane dissociation and association of CLCs and CHCs , respectively , were not directly regulated by de novo protein synthesis and degradation processes . However , PM protein internalization remained inhibited in the presence of exoge - nous auxin ( 120 min ; see Supplemental Figure 12 online ) , likely due to the proteasome - mediated degradation of CHCs despite the restoration of CLCs to the wild - type levels through de novo protein synthesis . These results suggest that the initial non - proteasome - dependent depletion of CLCs from membranes is likely to be the major determinant for the rapid auxin inhibition of PM protein traf ﬁ cking from the PM and TGN / EE . However , further investigation is required to understand the consequences to endocytosis and TGN / EE traf ﬁ cking brought on by the transient increase in membrane - associated CHC levels and its subsequent proteasome - mediated protein degradation in response to auxin . Clathrin - Mediated Traf ﬁ cking in PM Endocytosis and TGN / EE Sorting In addition to its role in CME , clathrin is associated with the TGN / EE ( Pesacreta and Lucas , 1984 ; Tanchak et al . , 1988 ; Dhonukshe et al . , 2007 ; Konopka et al . , 2008 ; Ito et al . , 2012 ) , and the clc2 clc3 double mutants showed decreased levels of TGN / EE - associated CHCs ( see Supplemental Figures 2 and 8 online ) , indicating that CLCs are required for CHC recruitment to both the PM and TGN / EE . In plant cells , the TGN / EE serves as the major protein sorting station for biosynthetic secretory proteins en route to the vac - uole and PM and meanwhile receives endocytosed material from the PM that may be delivered to the vacuole for degra - dation or recycled back to the PM ( Dettmer et al . , 2006 ; Lam et al . , 2007 ; Chow et al . , 2008 ; Viotti et al . , 2010 ) . The long postulated role for CCVs that bud from the TGN / EE in vacuolar protein sorting and traf ﬁ cking ( Harley and Beevers , 1989 ) is supported by studies showing that mutants defective for the A / ENTH domain – containing protein Epsin1 , which interacts with clathrin and adaptor protein 1 ( AP1 ) ( Song et al . , 2006 ) , as well as plant cells expressing a dominant - activated form of the GTPase ADP ribosylation factor 1 ( ARF1 ) , which is required for CCV protein association with membranes ( Pimpl et al . , 2003 ) , have vacuolar sorting defects . However , contradictory evidence showing that overexpression of the C terminus of CHC , which inhibits CME ( Dhonukshe et al . , 2007 ) , does not inhibit vacuolar protein transport ( Scheuring et al . , 2011 ) has called this model into question . Our study showing the impaired traf ﬁ cking of in - ternalized material to the vacuole lumen in the clc2 clc3 double mutants ( Figure 4 ; see Supplemental Figure 10 online ) appears to support the role of CCVs in vacuolar traf ﬁ cking , although it cannot be ruled out that the impaired vacuole delivery in the mutants is due to the initial reduction endocytosis and / or to other alterations in the balance of membrane ﬂ ux between the various endocytic compartments . An alternative , but not mutually exclusive function for TGN / EE - derived CCVs is to recycle internalized material back to the PM . Indeed , we have found that the recycling of internalized PIN2 - GFP and RCI2A - GFP to the PM was inhibited in the clc2 clc3 double mutants ( Figure 4 ; see Supplemental Figure 10 online ) . Taken together , our data suggest that CLCs regulate clathrin - mediated traf ﬁ cking required for PM endocytosis , re - cycling from the TGN / EE back to the PM , and potentially have a function in vacuolar protein traf ﬁ cking . The Role of CLCs in ABP1 - Mediated Auxin Signaling We demonstrated that the differential effects of auxin on the association of CLCs and CHCs with the PM and TGN / EE are APB1 dependent ( Figure 2 ; see Supplemental Figure 2 online ) and that CLCs play a regulatory role in ABP1 - mediated auxin regulation of clathrin function in PM protein internalization ( Fig - ures 5 and 6 ; see Supplemental Figures 13 online ) . However , the molecular mechanism by which auxin signaling is transduced between extracellular - and / or endoplasmic reticulum – localized APB1 and PM - and TGN / EE - localized CLCs remains to be elucidated . One candidate involved in this signaling pathway may be the Rho - like GTPase ROP6 , which has been demonstrated to par - ticipate in ABP1 - mediated auxin inhibition of PIN1 and PIN2 endocytosis in Arabidopsis roots ( Chen et al . , 2012 ; Lin et al . , 2012 ) . Similar to the clc2 - 1 clc3 - 1 double mutants ( Figures 6 and 7 ) , rop6 - 1 and rop6 - 2 mutants display a diminished root gravity response and a reduction in auxin - mediated inhibition of PIN internalization ( Chen et al . , 2012 ; Lin et al . , 2012 ) , suggesting that CLCs might be downstream targets of ROP6 - mediated signaling . Further studies showing a physical and / or genetic link between ROP6 and CLCs are required to support this model . The Role of CLCs in Plant Development Our phenotypic analyses of the clc2 - 1 and clc3 - 1 single mutants and clc2 clc3 double mutants ( Figures 3 , 4 , and 7 ) indicated that CLC2 and CLC3 are functionally redundant and necessary for auxin regulation of plant development . Likewise , the levels of PM - and TGN / EE - associated CLC1 were found to be modulated by exogenous auxin . However , due to the gametophytic lethality of the clc1 - 1 mutation , it remains to be determined whether CLC1 is functionally redundant with CLC2 and CLC3 . Our data therefore suggest that the rapid depletion of CLCs is essential for the ﬁ ne - tuning and rapid inhibition of CME by auxin and for the regulation of auxin ef ﬂ ux via properly localized PINs . As a consequence , some of the phenotypes observed in the clc2 clc3 double mutants are likely to be directly related to de - fects in auxin transport and distribution ( Figures 3 , 4 , and 7 ) . However , we expect that the clc2 clc3 double mutants will have additional phenotypes as the CLCs appear to be required for both general CME of PM proteins and the traf ﬁ cking of proteins from the TGN / EE . Our results reveal that CLCs play a crucial , regulatory role in plant developmental processes . Further anal - ysis of the clc2 clc3 double mutants and the roles of CLCs in CME and other clathrin - mediated traf ﬁ cking events will provide a greater understanding of the functional roles of clathrin in plant development , nutrient uptake , and responses to environmental cues .

Mutant lines from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center ( ABRC ) are as fol - lows : abp1 - 5 ( CS91358 ) , clc1 - 1 ( SALK _ 147101 ) , clc2 - 1 ( SALK _ 016049 ) , clc3 - 1 ( CS100219 ) , chc1 - 1 ( SALK _ 112213 ) , chc1 - 2 ( SALK _ 103252 ) , chc2 - 1 ( SALK _ 028826 ) , chc2 - 2 ( SALK _ 042321 ) , chc2 - 3 ( CS850328 ) , and pin2 ( SALK _ 144447 ) . Homozygous mutant lines were isolated and identi ﬁ ed by PCR and RT - PCR or sequencing - based assays ( see Supplemental Table 2 online ) .

All experimentswereperformedinMSbasalsaltswithminimalorganics ( Sigma - Aldrich ) supplemented with 1 % ( w / v ) Suc and 0 . 05 % ( w / v ) MES - KOH , pH 5 . 6 ( 0 . 5 3 MS ) , liquid medium , except where speci ﬁ ed . The pH of the medium after addition of chemical stock solutions was con ﬁ rmed to be ; 5 . 6 to 5 . 62 . Constructs and Complementation Test The constructs of 35S : CLC1 - GFP , ProCLC2 : CLC2 , and ProCLC3 : CLC3 were generated using PCR , restriction digestion , and ligation with trans - formationvectors . Theconstructof 35S : : GFP - ABP1 D KDEL wasgenerated as previously described by Robert et al . ( 2010 ) and transformed into Columbia - 0 . To test the complementation for the clc2 - 1 clc3 - 1 double mutants , ProCLC2 : CLC2 and ProCLC3 : CLC3 were transformed into the clc2 - 1 clc3 - 1 double homozygous lines , respectively . After recovering T1 plants ( clc2 - 1 clc3 - 1 : : CLC2 and clc2 - 1 clc3 - 1 : : CLC3 ) , they were crossed with each other to generate the clc2 - 1 clc3 - 1 : : CLC2 CLC3 plants by PCR - and RT - PCR – basedassays . AllprimersequencesareindicatedinSupplemental Table 2 online . Polyclonal Antibodies Polyclonalantibodies ( anti - AtCLC1 , anti - AtCLC2 , anti - AtCLC3 , anti - AtCHC [ which cross - reacts with both CHC1 and CHC2 isoforms ] , and anti - AtPIN2 ) were raised in rabbits using synthesized peptides related to each protein ( see Supplemental Table 3 online ) coupled with keyhole limpet hemocyanin containing an additional N - terminal Cys ( Huabio ) . Antibodies were af ﬁ nity puri ﬁ edusingimmobilizedpeptideaf ﬁ nitycolumns , andtheirspeci ﬁ citywas veri ﬁ ed as shown in Supplemental Figures 9C and 14 online . Cytology and Immunodetection Immunolocalization studies were preformed in primary roots as described Sauer et al . ( 2006b ) . Primary antibodies , against CLC1 , CLC2 , CLC3 , CHC , and PIN2 , were detected using Cy3 - labeled anti - rabbit secondary antibodies ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . Images were captured using CLSM ( Leica TCS SP5 AOBS ) . Excitation wavelengths were 488 nm ( argon laser ) for GFP and 561 nm ( diode laser ) for Cy3 . Emission was detected at 496 to 532 nm for GFP and 550 to 570 nm for Cy3 . For quantitative measurement of ﬂ uorescence intensities , laser , pinhole , andgainsettings oftheconfocal microscopewere identical among different treatments or genotypes . To measure the intensities of ﬂ uorescence signals at the PM and TGN / EE , digital images were analyzed using Image J ( http : / / rsb . info . nih . gov / ij ) , and the relative ﬂ uorescence intensities were presented as percentages of mock controls as previously described ( Sauer et al . , 2006a ; Robert et al . , 2010 ) . As theintracellular poolsof CLCs andCHCsare predominantly associated with the TGN / EE ( Dhonukshe et al . , 2007 ; Konopka et al . , 2008 ; Robert et al . , 2010 ) , the levels of TGN / EE - associated CLCs and CHCs were determined by measuring total intracellular ﬂ uorescence intensities of GFP - fused or Cy3 - labeled secondary antibody detected proteins . For measurements ofBFA - induced internalization of PM - localized proteins , the levels of internalized GFP - fused or Cy3 - labeled secondary antibody detected PM proteins were presented as the average number of ﬂ uorescence - labeled BFA bodies per cell ( Robert et al . , 2010 ) . Due to internalized GFP - fused PM proteins predominantly accumulating in the vacuolar lumen 2 to 4 h after dark treatments ( Kleine - Vehn et al . , 2008 ; Laxmi et al . , 2008 ) , average intensities of vacuolar GFP - fused PM proteins were calculated by measuring the total intracellular signal using Image J , and the relative intensities were presented as percentages of wild - type controls . In all above quanti ﬁ cation of the CLSM data , the minimum numbers of 15 individual roots and 10 to 15 cells per root from three in - dependent experiments were analyzed for each time point treatment . A Student ’ s t test ( paired with two - tailed distribution ) was used in statistical analysis for all the quantitative data . Root Hair Polarity and LRP For the root hair polarity analysis , relative positions of hair initiation were indicated as apical - basal initiation ratio = initiation length ( µ m ) / cell length ( µ m ) ( Grebe et al . , 2002 ) . Initiation length indicated the distance from the central of the root hair base to the basal cell wall of the cell . The numbers 0 and 1 represent the basal and apical sides of the trichoblast cell , re - spectively . The apical - basal initiation ratios of 10 trichoblast cells per root were calculated . The apical - basal initiation ratios of ; 300 trichoblast cells from 30 roots per genotype from three independent experiments were used to analyze for class distributions . Fisher ’ s exact test applying the “ Fisher 2 by 5 ” program ( http : / / www . quantitativeskills . com / sisa / ) was used to analyze independence of distributions . For the LRP assay , DR5 : GUS was used to examine LRP formation ( Benková et al . , 2003 ) . Seven - to 10 - day - old seedlings were incubated in theX - glucstainingsolution ( 10mMEDTA , 0 . 1 % TritonX - 100 , 2mMFe 2 + CN , 2 mM Fe 3 + CN , 100 µ g / mL chloramphenicol , and 1 mg / mL X - gluc in 50 mM phosphate buffer , pH 7 . 0 ) at 37°C overnight . After staining , tissues were cleared using 70 % ethanol to remove chlorophyll for tissue localization and photographed using a dissecting microscope . The LRP density ( the ratio of the LRP number to the root length ) of 30 seedling roots from three independent experiments was used to evaluate LRP formation pattern for each age per genotype . 14 of 18 The Plant Cell Auxin Sensitivity , Transport and Distribution , and Root Gravitropism For the auxin sensitivity assay , 5 - d - old vertically grown seedlings were transferred from 0 . 5 3 MS agar plates to 0 . 5 3 MS agar plates with dif - ferent 2 , 4 - D concentrations ( 0 , 0 . 01 , 0 . 05 , 0 . 1 , 0 . 5 , and 1 µ M ) . Root elongation measurements were performed after 3 d . To determine the distribution of auxin in roots , the DR5 : GFP auxin - responsive reporter ( Benková et al . , 2003 ) was introgressed into the clc2 - 1 clc3 - 1 double mutant lines , and DR5 : GFP expression within root tips was analyzed 2 h after gravistimulation by CLSM . Root gravitropic response was evaluated using the gravitropic index , which was de ﬁ ned as the ratio between the vertical distance / ordinate from the root tip to the root base and the root length ( Grabov et al . , 2005 ) . For the quanti ﬁ cation of above experimental data , digital images collected from 30 seedlings per genotype from three independent experiments were analyzed using Image J . For the quanti - ﬁ cation of root and hypocotyl lengths , digital images of 45 seedlings per genotype from three independent experiments were collected and were analyzed using Image J . A Student ’ s t test ( paired with two - tailed dis - tribution ) was used in statistical analysis for all the quantitative data . For the root basipetal auxin transport assay , 10 5 - d - old light - grown seedlings were transferred to plates containing 0 . 5 3 MS 1 . 5 % ( w / v ) agar media and incubated for 1 h . Agar blocks ( 1 . 25 % ) of 1 mm in diameter containing the same growth medium supplemented with 100 nM tritium - labeled IAA ( 3 H - IAA ) were placed next to root tips . After incubation for 1 . 5 h in dark , agar blocks were removed . Root tips of ; 0 . 3 mm in length were excised and discarded . Two consecutive 2 - mm root segments were then excised from the remaining root and placed separately into two scintil - lation vials . Each vial contained 2 mL of scintillation ﬂ uid . The amounts of radioactivity in the two root segments were pooled from 10 roots and measured using a Perkin - Elmer 1450 Microbeta scintillation counter for 1 min . The experiments were repeated three times , and the data were statistically evaluated using a Student ’ s t test ( paired with two - tailed distribution ) .
