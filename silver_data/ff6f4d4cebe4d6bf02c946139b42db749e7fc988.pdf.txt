Salt - free polyelec - trolytes are distinct from uncharged polymers as they presumably form a rather rigid , isotropic mesh . The polyelectrolyte characteristic mesh size is known as de Gennes correlation length ξ . We directly probed the mesh formed by DNA and HA , by employing ﬂ uorescence correlation spectroscopy ( FCS ) to measure the di ﬀ usion coe ﬃ cient of ﬂ uorescently labeled DNA fragments added in trace amounts . For the salt - free solutions we found that the DNA or HA mesh size has to be 2 − 3 times larger than the fragments for them to start to di ﬀ use freely ( as if in the dilute solution ) . For a tighter mesh ( concentrations 0 . 1 − 1 g / L ) , the fragment di ﬀ usion coe ﬃ cient is only half the free di ﬀ usion value . Conversely , fragments show the free di ﬀ usion coe ﬃ cient  as if there is no mesh  in DNA or HA in 10 mM bu ﬀ er . This complies well with the fact that the ξ fades for polyelectrolytes with added salt . The di ﬀ usion coe ﬃ cient falls o ﬀ further when the mesh size gets smaller than the fragment size ( above 1 g / L ) and a similar value is reached in bu ﬀ er as well as in pure water , respectively , at the highest measured concentrations ( 10 g / L ) . We also performed small - angle X - ray scattering ( SAXS ) on HA and DNA ( range 3 − 130 g / L ) to complement our previous dielectric spectroscopy ( DS ) studies ( range 0 . 01 − 5 g / L ) . Combined , these methods provide reference values of the de Gennes length ξ across the range studied by FCS . ■ INTRODUCTION Polyelectrolytes are polymers with ionizable groups on their constituent monomers . Therefore , they dissociate in polar solvents , such as water into polyions and a cloud of small counterions . The long - range Coulomb interaction among all these entities makes polyelectrolytes quite unlike uncharged polymers in aqueous solvents . The electrostatics leads both to distinctive technical applications and to di ﬃ culties in under - standing these systems . 1 − 4 Polyions , as well as polymers , depending on their rigidity can be modeled as ideal , freely jointed chains , as segmented ( Kuhn ) chains , as wormlike chains , or even as rod - like objects . 4 The polyion backbone , as a source of the potential for the ionic atmosphere can be modeled either as a linear charge , or a line of discrete charges , or as a 3D object ( cylinder ) with some charge distribution . 5 The strong electrostatic potential of the polyion may cause counterions to Manning condense on the polyion to reduce its e ﬀ ective charge . 6 , 7 In understanding the conformation of polyions and their arrangement in solution , the counterion atmosphere enters as a source of screening for the charges of the polyion backbone . 8 , 9 As such the polyion backbone rigidity may be strongly enhanced due to a lack of screening . The way the polyion is modeled also depends on the way the atmosphere is described : mean - ﬁ eld approximation , Poisson − Boltzmann , within the Debye − Hu ̈ ckel approximation or a nonlinear PB , or a nonmean - ﬁ eld approximation taking charge correlations into account . 10 − 12 Considering all the above , one should take into account the conformational properties of a single polyion , and the spatial arrangement of the polyion ensemble , 13 as well as the ( radial ) distribution of their ionic atmosphere . Experiments on polyelectrolytes necessarily re ﬂ ect e ﬀ ects of both components , polyions and the ionic cloud , all the while being designed to distinguish between the e ﬀ ects of the two contributions by , e . g . , studying the polyion conformation in varying ( counter ) ion atmospheres , 14 − 16 or by studying the changes to the atmosphere that may occur with variation in polyion length , sti ﬀ nes or concentration . 17 − 19 In this work we demonstrate how the dynamics of the complete polyion - counterion atmosphere system directly re ﬂ ects the static conformation of polyions , and how the experimental approaches addressing either component may provide results on one and the same parameter  the de Gennes correlation length ( mesh size ) . 20 The applied description of polyelectrolytes is based on the evaluation of di ﬀ erent length scales which primarily depend on polyion and added salt concentrations ( see Appendix A ) . A simple way to understand de Gennes length is that it is the characteristic size Received : October 16 , 2012 Revised : January 6 , 2013 Published : January 28 , 2013 Article pubs . acs . org / Macromolecules © 2013 American Chemical Society 1107 dx . doi . org / 10 . 1021 / ma3021486 | Macromolecules 2013 , 46 , 1107 − 1118 of the mesh formed by the polyions in the solution . Quite often ξ is depicted as such , 8 , 17 , 21 as shown in Figure 1 . We remind the reader , however , that such a simpli ﬁ ed depiction of a mesh may apply also to a semidilute solution of uncharged polymers , while de Gennes length scale is characteristic of semidilute polyelectrolytes and is not experimentally observed for uncharged polymer solutions . The physical meaning of a correlation length is that beyond this distance correlation between the polyion chain segments should vanish . This notion is used in conjunction with interpretations of the origin of the peak in the scattering curves . 22 The peak position q m is considered to provide a direct measurement of the correlation length ξ = 2 π / q m . Koyama 23 , 24 has simulated scattering intensity of a polyelectrolyte . These curves featured a peak , when existence of a correlation hole was assumed . The hole represents a ξ region around the polyion segment where the probability that another segments will be found is negligible . The tendency for segments to stay at a distance is due to Coulomb repulsion . Besides the lack of the peak for uncharged polymers , this description is supported also by the suppression of the scattering peak with addition of salt to polyelectrolytes . Added salt screens the Coulomb repulsion of the segments  thus the correlation hole and the corresponding peak disappear 22 , 25 The depiction of the mesh may be improved by introducing a third dimension , Figure 1b ) . We assume that , on average , three polyions for three directions in space , approach and cross each other and thus delimit a mesh cell of the polyion network . The size of the mesh cell L cell may be interpreted as the average distance between the nearest - neighbor chain segments . Here , we take into account that a polyelectrolyte should be isotropic and homogeneous and that it does not show any long - range ordering . Indeed , very early it has been shown that polyelectrolytes do not form any ordered structure . 23 E . g . , there should not be any domains where polyions stretch parallel to each other . 25 Oriented domains only occur at very high concentrations where liquid crystalline organization appears ( for DNA , above 150 − 200 g / L ) . 26 Also , only a few polyions should cross each other within a given portion of space , and thus form a mesh cell . If this were not the case , local concentration would be enhanced , thus inducing reductions elsewhere , which would not lead to polyelectrolyte homoge - neity . The size L cell is directly de ﬁ ned by the polyelectrolyte concentration . That is , the number of monomers found within the cell is ( 1 / 4 ) ( ( 3 L cell ) / b ) , where b is the monomer size of the polyelectrolyte in question . A factor 1 / 4 enters as the polyions are found on the edges − so only a quarter of each is found within the cell . This number of monomers , when divided by the cell volume L cell3 gives the polyelectrolyte monomer concen - tration ( number density ) n = 3 / ( 4 * b * ( L cell ) 2 ) . Evidently , the mesh cell size or near - neighbor distance of chain segments in the mesh scales as expected for correlation length ξ ≈ ≈ − L bn ( ) cell 1 / 2 ( 1 ) We note that these considerations apply best for the semirigid polyelectrolytes whose persistence length is longer than correlation length 21 and so , on the level of the cell , they behave as rigid rods . This condition may also be satis ﬁ ed for ﬂ exible polyelectrolytes when there is no added salt , as the electrostatic contribution to the persistence length may be signi ﬁ cant . 18 , 27 Locally rigid mesh is the least dense way to pack polyions in the solution  it allows for maximum distance of segments and a reduction in Coulomb interaction . For a ﬂ exible polyelectrolyte , relating the mesh size and concentration depends on how many monomers get packed into one electrostatic blob . That is , a more ﬂ exible polyelectrolyte , possibly with only a fraction of charged monomers , in a highly screening environment with added salt gets locally coiled into electrostatic blobs and behaves as a chain of such blobs . 9 For such a polyelectrolyte the above relationship between the monomer concentration and the mesh size is more ambiguous and maybe not even linear . 28 In this work we relate the physical size of the mesh cell evidenced by ﬂ uorescence correlation spectroscopy ( FCS ) with the correlation length as obtained from small angle X - ray scattering ( SAXS ) and dielectric spectroscopy ( DS , see Appendix B ) experiments  and we ascertain the absolute values for this length scale in the conditions of no added salt , where the ionic atmosphere consists only of counterions that have dissociated from the polyion . In such a case electrostatic screening is reduced to a minimum and the long - range of electrostatic force emphasizes the distinctive nature of the polyelectrolytes compared to the uncharged polymers . In the opposite case of high added salt , screening renders poly - electrolytes with quite similar properties as those of uncharged polymers . This is a standard explanation for the routinely observed suppression of the polyelectrolyte peak in scattering curves . 22 , 24 Now , we show also by FCS that the polyion mesh dissappears in these conditions  that the polyions become uncorrelated . Here we note that application of optical techniques to measure di ﬀ usion , i . e . , dynamics of molecules within rigid networks ( actin network ) has been reported quite some time ago by Sackmann et al . . 13 Quasi - elastic light scattering was used for discerning dynamics of actin ﬁ laments and the mesh they form . However , FCS distinguishes itself by providing utmost distinction between the probe molecule and the mesh iself . It is well accepted for studies of crowded macromolecular environments . 29 , 30 We study semirigid biopolyelectrolytes DNA and hyaluronic acid ( HA , a polysaccharide ) which have a rather large structural persistence length , ∼ 50 nm 31 and ∼ 10 nm , 27 , 32 respectively . This and very low added salt conditions ensure that the polyelectrolyte mesh is built by rodlike polyions which simpli ﬁ es our considerations . For comparison , most synthetic polyelectrolytes , with their − C − C − backbone and monomer size of 0 . 25 nm have the structural persistence length comparable to this monomer size , and are considered as ﬂ exible . We report SAXS and FCS experiments on polydisperse DNA and HA , both in forms of sodium salts , at concentrations where these are in the semidilute regime . This study Figure 1 . ( a ) Long overlapping chains form a semidilute solution , depicted 21 as a twodimensional , 2D polyion network , with correlation length / mesh size denoted as ξ . ( b ) Mesh cell delimited by three ( for three directions in space ) chains crossing each other . The size of such a cell is the mesh size of the polyion network in 3D . Macromolecules Article dx . doi . org / 10 . 1021 / ma3021486 | Macromolecules 2013 , 46 , 1107 − 1118 1108 complements our previous DS study of these samples , 18 , 33 as well as SAXS , DS and FCS studies of solutions of monodiperse , 150 bp mononucleosomal DNA fragments . 15 , 19 , 25 , 34 We include the static properties and dynamic responses  originating from di ﬀ erent techniques that probe di ﬀ erent components of the polyelectrolyte solution , in order to create a consistent picture of a fundamental length scale describing a polyelectrolyte as an ensemble . ■ EXPERIMENTAL METHODS Materials . Solutions of deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) and hyaluronic acid ( HA ) , both in forms of sodium salts , were prepared in ultrapure water ( Millipore Milli - Q ) , in most cases without addition of any simple salts or a bu ﬀ er . Dissolution in pure water , without a bu ﬀ er leads to a solution where pH is de ﬁ ned by CO 2 dissolved in water , and we get pH about 6 . In these conditions both DNA ( p K a = 0 ) and HA ( p K a = 3 . 2 35 ) are fully ionized . In the course of our previous studies 18 , 19 , 33 , 34 where we used DNA and HA samples described just below , we assured that the salt content in these samples is negligible , less than one added salt ion per 10 monomers . Dialysing or not the samples prior to use gave no discernible e ﬀ ect , so it was not attempted for this study . Thus , samples dissolved in pure water are taken to be free of added salt . Salmon testes lyophilized DNA threads were obtained from Sigma - Aldrich ( Cat . No . D1626 ) . This DNA is polydisperse , with chain sizes in the range from 2 kbp to 20 kbp ( contour length 0 . 7 − 7 μ m ) and presumably up to 200 kbp . 15 , 36 Hyaluronic acid sodium salt from Streptococcus equi sp . was obtained from Sigma - Aldrich ( Cat . No . Fluka53747 ) . The low protein content is declared by the manufacturer . An average molecular weight is about 1 . 63 × 10 6 Da , implying an average polymerizaton degree of 4000 , or a contour length of 4 μ m . 33 , 37 Because the studied DNA and HA have rather long chain lengths , in the micrometer range , the corresponding dilute - semidilute crossover concentrations are expected to be several orders of magnitude below the concentration range we studied . 14 , 17 Thus , these samples are certainly in the semidilute regime . We denote them as long DNA or HA . In this paper , we will often refer to works 15 , 19 , 25 , 34 on mononucleosomal DNA fragments , prepared 38 by enzymatic digestion of H1 - depleted calf thymus chromatin . 39 These highly monodisperse samples contain 150 ± 10 bp fragments ( as checked by gel - electrophoresis ) together with traces of 300 − 350 bp fragments that correspond to two nucleosomal DNA fragments connected by undigested linker DNA . Unlike micrometer - sized long DNA or HA , these fragments are only 50 nm long , and practically rod - like . As there are nominally 146bp of DNA wrapped in a nucleosome , we denote these samples DNA146 . The following protocols were used for preparation of di ﬀ erent sample solution sets . Protocol I . For SAXS , long DNA in pure water , and concentration range 3 − 130 g / L . A mother solution of 130 g / L was prepared by adding 13 . 0 mg of dry DNA ﬁ bers and 100 μ L pure water into a polyethylene bag ( 20 μ m thick ﬁ lm ) . The bag was then inserted into the sample holder of the SAXS instrument for measurements . Lower concentrations were prepared by diluting the same sample ( in the original bag ) with water . The higher concentration solutions are rather viscous , and manipulation in the bag facilitated sample homoge - nization , without excessive mixing or vortexing that would shear the chains . Protocol II . For SAXS , HA in pure water , and concentration range 10 − 100 g / L . The set of solutions was prepared by dissolving weighted amounts of dry HA grains in adequate amounts of pure water , and equilibration at 4 ° C for a week . They were mixed with a pipet or a spatula before application to SAXS sample holder . Protocol III . For FCS measurements of the di ﬀ usion coe ﬃ cient of DNA fragments . 19 Fluorescently labeled DNA 110bp fragments ( DNA110 * ) with Cy5 ﬂ uorophore at one end were obtained from Microsynth AG . In order to achieve a 20 nM ﬂ uorophore concentration , required for FCS , we added 2 μ L of a DNA110 * stock solution ( 500 μ M in basepairs ) into 500 μ L aliquots of long DNA , HA or DNA146 samples of varying concentrations ( DNA : 0 . 0015 − 22 . 5 mM or 0 . 001 − 15 g / L , HA : 0 . 0025 − 5 mM or 0 . 001 − 2 g / L ) . These were prepared either in 10 mM TE ( Tris - Cl pH7 . 5 + 1 mM EDTA ) bu ﬀ er or in pure water , where only traces of the bu ﬀ er < 0 . 05 mM were present , originating from the addition of labeled DNA stock . Small - Angle X - ray Scattering . Small angle X - ray scattering experiments were performed on two Kratky cameras which were equipped with linear position sensitive detectors ( PSD 50 , Hecus X - ray system ) and sealed tube generators with copper anode . Cu K α radiation ( λ = 1 . 542 Å ) was selected with Ni ﬁ lter in combination with a pulse height discriminator . SAXS intensity curves from DNA solutions were acquired by using the camera mounted on 1 kW tube while beam size was set to 0 . 2 mm × 3 mm . The path between the sample and the detector ( = 50 cm ) was evacuated to reduce background scattering . DNA solution was enclosed into a polyethylene bag ( see protocol I above ) while pure water in such a bag was used for background measurements . For HA experiments we used a System 3 camera ( Hecus X - ray Systems , Graz , Austria ) with a beam size of 0 . 5 mm × 3 . 5 mm , sample − detector distance of 30 cm and a 2 kW tube . Thus , more intense primary beam was used for HA samples and , as a whole camera is evacuated , the air scattering ( background ) is lower which is particularly important for weakly scattering samples like HA . A small amount of the HA solutions was applied in the sample holder of the SAXS instrument by a pipet or , for higher concentrations , a spatula was used . Then , the sample was enclosed by mylar windows . For all samples , experiments were performed at room temperature with exposure times of 900 s . The scattering from the pure water was subtracted from the data and thus only scattering intensity contributions from the macromolecules and counterions was analyzed . SAXS data were reported as a function of q , the magnitude of the scattering vector , de ﬁ ned by the angle between the incidence and scattered radiation 2 θ and the X - ray wavelength λ through the relation q = ( 4 π / λ ) sin ( θ ) . The angular calibration was performed with silver - stearate and silver - behenate standards . Using the above con ﬁ gurations , the accessible ranges of the scattering vector q were 0 . 1 − 3 . 1 nm − 1 and 0 . 09 − 5 . 5 nm − 1 for DNA and HA experiments , respectively . Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy . We have used Zeiss ConfoCor II FCS instrument . The focal volume was de ﬁ ned by a Zeiss Plan - NeoFluar 100x / NA1 . 3 water immersion objective , epi - illumina - tion was by He − Ne 632 . 8 nm 5 mW laser , for excitation of the Cy5 ﬂ uorophore . Measurements were performed at 25 ° C , the ambient temperature of the temperature stabilized clean - room . Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy is used to measure the di ﬀ usion coe ﬃ cient of the ﬂ uorescently labeled molecules . Number ﬂ uctuations of the molecules entering and leaving the focal volume of the instrument are registered as ﬂ uorescence variation . An autocorrelation function is calculated for the ﬂ uorescence intensity trace . In other words , the signal is analyzed for self - similarity after the lag time τ : τ τ τ = + + + + − − τ τ τ τ ⎛ ⎝⎜ ⎞ ⎠⎟ ⎛ ⎝⎜⎜ ⎛ ⎝⎜ ⎞ ⎠⎟⎞⎠⎟⎟ ( ) G N T T ( ) 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 exp f w z T 2 D D 0 0 ( 2 ) Here , N f is the average number of ﬂ uorescent molecules in the focal volume , z 0 / w 0 is the focal volume structure parameter and T , average fraction of ﬂ uorophores in the triplet state ( thus , non ﬂ uorescing ) . The lifetime τ T of the triplet state is taken into account when ﬁ tting . The characteristic decay time τ D is the di ﬀ usion time that the ﬂ uorescent molecule takes to traverse the focal volume . The details of the procedure we used to extract τ D may be found in . 19 For demonstration , in Figure 2 , besides the G ( τ ) experimental curve and Macromolecules Article dx . doi . org / 10 . 1021 / ma3021486 | Macromolecules 2013 , 46 , 1107 − 1118 1109 ﬁ t for Cy5 ( as a standard ) , we present the G ( τ ) curves recorded for DNA110 * in semidilute long DNA solution or in dilute DNA146 solution ( 2 μ M DNA110 * in 0 . 2 mM long DNA or DNA146 in very low salt < 0 . 05 mM ) . The inset emphasizes the di ﬀ erence between the di ﬀ usion times and how well the experimental data may be ﬁ tted . The di ﬀ usion time , extracted by ﬁ ts to eq 2 is inversely proportional to the self - di ﬀ usion coe ﬃ cient D . The relationship between τ D and D may be obtained from the measurement of τ Cy5 for Cy5 ﬂ uorophore itself , whose di ﬀ usion coe ﬃ cient is known , D Cy5 = 3 . 16 × 10 − 10 m 2 / s : 40 τ τ = D D D Cy5 Cy5 ( 3 ) The di ﬀ usion coe ﬃ cients D that we obtain from τ D are for the ﬂ uorescently labeled DNA110 * molecules , di ﬀ using in solutions that contain varying concentrations of HA , long DNA or DNA146 . That is , we obtain D 110 * exp , di ﬀ usion coe ﬃ cient for DNA110 * which , however , depends on monomer concentration c of these solutions . We remind that the double stranded DNA ( dsDNA ) persistence length L p = 50 nm 31 is comparable to the contour length of DNA110 * , 38 nm . Therefore , we expect that DNA110 * assumes an extended , rodlike con ﬁ guration . According to Tirado et al . 41 the translational di ﬀ usion coe ﬃ cient calculated for a rodlike macromolecule is given by πη = + D kT L d L 3 ln ( / ) 0 . 312 th c c ( 4 ) Here L c = Nb is contour length , d is polyion diameter , η = 8 . 9 × 10 − 4 Pas is viscosity of water ( T = 298 K ) . With b = 0 . 34 nm and d = 2 . 6 nm , the di ﬀ usion coe ﬃ cient for 110bp DNA is D 110 * th = 3 . 98 × 10 − 11 m 2 / s . Stellwagen et al . 42 have reviewed the literature and shown that the expression by Tirado et al . is well applicable to experimental data obtained for DNA molecules in size from 10 to 1000 basepairs . ■ RESULTS SAXS . The scattering curves for long DNA and HA solutions at di ﬀ erent concentrations are presented in Figure 3 and 4 , respectively . The scattering intensities obtained for both systems as a function of q may be roughly subdivided into three regions . Below 0 . 2 nm − 1 there is the typical polyelectrolyte upturn . This feature has been observed , studied and discussed by others 15 , 22 , 37 , 43 and was related to formation of chain aggregates or locally ordered domains . At the highest q - values , all curves decrease roughly as q − 1 . This scattering intensity dependence is typical of rodlike scatterers , and the segments of polyelectrolyte chains may easily be taken as such . 23 , 37 , 44 In an intermediate q - range , which we examine further in more details , intensity curves reveal characteristic features which re ﬂ ect the structure of the solution . The intensity curves for long DNA ( Figure 3 ) display a broad maximum often called the polyelectrolyte scattering peak . The position of the maximum , q m , shifts toward higher wave vectors and greater intensity with increasing DNA concentration . Such a behavior is common for polyelectrolyte solutions at low added salt conditions . 22 , 45 , 46 We also note that Figure 2 . Experimental autocorrelation functions G ( τ ) recorded for ﬂ uorescently labeled 110 bp double - stranded DNA fragments : DNA110 * in semidilute long DNA solution or in dilute DNA146 solution ( 2 μ M DNA110 * in 0 . 2 mM , either long DNA or DNA146 in very low salt conditions < 0 . 05 mM ) . For comparison , the autocorrelation function ( denoted Cy5 ) is shown for 20 nM Cy5 ﬂ uorophore in pure water , without any DNA . The inset zooms the correlation time range 250 − 850 μ s . The arrow in the inset denotes 350 μ s di ﬀ erence between the respective di ﬀ usion times obtained by ﬁ ts . The experimental values of G ( τ ) are shown with symbols and the respective ﬁ ts with lines . Figure 3 . SAXS intensity vs scattering wave vector q at T = 25 ° C for pure water DNA solutions ( concentrations 16 − 130 g / L ) . The arrow denotes the shift with concentration of the position of the peak , corresponding to a wave vector q m . The curves have been shifted for clarity . Figure 4 . SAXS intensity vs scattering wave vector q at T = 25 ° C for pure water HA solutions ( concentrations 10 − 100 g / L ) . The arrow denotes the shift with concentration of the position of the shoulder , corresponding to a wave vector q m . The curves have been shifted for clarity . Macromolecules Article dx . doi . org / 10 . 1021 / ma3021486 | Macromolecules 2013 , 46 , 1107 − 1118 1110 we obtained similar q m values for our solutions of micrometer - sized , polydisperse DNA as did Bloom ﬁ eld and Wang 25 for solutions of monodisperse , rod - like nucleosomal DNA frag - ments only 50 nm long . This is a precise demonstration ( after Koch et al . 15 ) of the fact that in a semidilute solution identity of polyion segments is lost  it is not possible to discern whether a segment found in the vicinity of another is part of the same chain or another one . In other words , the solution structure , the arrangement of all the segments connected in chains , i . e . , long DNA , appears similar to the arrangement of separate segments , i . e . , rod - like short DNA molecules . Our data for pure water solutions of HA are shown in Figure 4 . The marked di ﬀ erence between DNA and HA sets of data is immediately obvious : A well pronounced correlation peak is missing in the scattering intensities measured for HA solutions , only a shoulder appears . However , it is clear from Figure 4 that the shoulder shifts toward higher q with increasing concen - tration , indicating changes in the local structure of the HA mesh . Only Villetti et al . , 37 to the best of our knowledge , reported SAXS of HA solution ( 15 g / L ) from our HA concentration range . Notably , their scattering curve features also a shoulder at a q - position that ﬁ ts into our data set . Moreover , they noticed that the absence of the polyelectrolyte peak can be attributed to the weak electrostatic nature of HA chains and , upon shearing , the electrostatic interaction is magni ﬁ ed and the polyelectrolyte peak was restored at the place of the shoulder . This is in accordance with the calculated scattering intensity as a function of the interaction strength between the polyelectrolyte segments . 23 , 24 Further interpreta - tion of HA scattering intensities may be found in Supporting Information . Following the above , in order for us to be able to compare the results for HA and DNA , we attempt to determine q m from the HA spectra in a simple , model - independent way . We propose that the shoulder position in HA scattering curves could be regarded as the polyelectrolyte peak position q m . As any choice would be rather arbitrary and also to simplify the analysis , q m is taken to be at the intersection of the q − 1 line and the q independent part of the curve , as presented for 85 g / L HA solution , Figure 5 . With this choice of q m for HA , in Figure 6 we present the evolution of q m as a function of either DNA or HA concentration . Data by Bloom ﬁ eld and Wang 25 for solutions of monodisperse DNA fragments is shown for comparison . Indeed , as expected for semidilute solutions , q m scales with concentration as c 1 / 2 for both HA and DNA . 14 , 20 , 25 FCS . In Figure 7 we present D 110 * exp , the di ﬀ usion coe ﬃ cient of DNA110 * polyion in various conditions . In the upper panel we present the homogeneous system DNA110 * / DNA146 , where the labeled DNA110 * polyions di ﬀ use in the environment of similarly sized DNA146 fragments . In the lower panel we show data for the hetereogeneous systems DNA110 * / DNA and DNA110 * / HA , where the labeled DNA110 * polyions di ﬀ use in the mesh formed by long DNA or HA chains . The values of D 110 * exp are shown as a function of the monomer concentration c of the polyelectrolyte that de ﬁ nes the system in question . The concentration range of the FCS study overlaps with the range of the correlation length / mesh size studies by SAXS and DS . 18 , 33 Homogeneous System DNA110 * / DNA146 . First , we address the behavior of the homogeneous system DNA110 * / DNA146 in 10 mM TE bu ﬀ er ( Figure 7 , upper panel ) . Below c = 1 − 2 mM , D 110 * exp ( DNA146 ) is constant within the experimental error , with the average value D 110 * exp ( DNA146 ) = 3 . 9 ± 0 . 1 × 10 − 11 m 2 / s . This value is very close to the theoretical value D 110 * th of the self - di ﬀ usion coe ﬃ cient for rodlike particles , eq 4 ( see Experimental Methods , FCS section ) . It is also very close to the value 3 . 95 × 10 − 11 m 2 / s that we obtained for DNA110 * diluted down to 1 . 5 μ M directly with 10 mM TE bu ﬀ er ( without DNA146 ) . The decrease of D 110 * exp ( DNA146 ) above c = 1 − 2 mM is due to the excluded volume e ﬀ ects and relates well with the dilute - semidilute crossover concentration for 40 − 50 nm long rodlike DNA molecules 25 , 34 that we work with . The self - di ﬀ usion coe ﬃ cient has been previously shown to decrease linearly with the volume fraction Φ of rod - like particles , for e . g . a mineral , boehmite , L ≈ 300 nm , 47 and 20 bp dsDNA L ≈ 7 nm : 48 Figure 5 . SAXS intensity for HA solution 85 g / L ( topmost curve ) . This data is subtracted for the background ( H 2 O ) intensity . The resulting intensity curve features q − 1 dependence at high q . The shoulder position , q m is taken to be at the intersection of the q − 1 line and the horizontal line . Figure 6 . Characteristic wave - vector q m extracted from the scattering curves for pure water long DNA and HA solutions is shown versus polyelectrolyte monomer concentration . We note that we obtained similar q m values for solutions of μ m - long , polydisperse DNA as Bloom ﬁ eld and Wang 25 obtained for solutions of monodisperse 50 nm nucleosomal DNA fragments . The dashed lines denote that q m scales with the square root of the concentration both for HA and DNA .

As stated above , our experimental values at practically in ﬁ nite dilution of 1 . 5 μ M are very close to the theoretical D 110 * th , thus the latter we take as D 0 . For DNA , molar concentration c ( in mM ) is related to volume fraction as Φ ≈ 0 . 001 c . The slope α depends on the aspect ratio p = L c / d of the particle ( polyion ) , according to the variational calculation by Dhont et al . : 47 α = + − + − p p 2 10 32 ( 1 ) 1 53 ( 1 ) 2 ( 6 ) For DNA110 * , p ≈ 15 , leads to α ≈ 10 − 15 . Fit of eq 5 to D 110 * exp ( DNA146 ) gives α ≈ 30 ( full line in Figure 7 , upper panel ) , in a reasonable agreement with the theoretical value . Wilk et al . 48 observed a similar di ﬀ erence between the theoretical and experimental slope , and attributed this di ﬀ erence to a contribution of the counterion atmosphere to the volume fraction . Second , we address the behavior of the homogeneous system DNA110 * / DNA146 in very low salt conditions ( Figure 7 , upper panel ) . A principal feature is that in the concentration range 0 . 02 − 1 mM , D 110 * exp ( DNA146 ) in very low salt conditions appears reduced for about 10 % compared to values in bu ﬀ er . This reduction of the di ﬀ usion coe ﬃ cient with reduction in the ionic strength is also the e ﬀ ect of the counterion atmosphere on the volume occupied by DNA fragments . In order to check this concept by Wilk et al . we recalculated the fragment volume in order to ﬁ t eq 5 also to our very low salt data set . That is , for the diameter of the DNA fragments we took d + κ − 1 / k and for the length L c + κ − 1 / k , where k is an arbitrary factor and κ − 1 is the Debye screening length , de ﬁ ned by the counterion concentration in the absence of added salt ( see Appendix A ) . We used a following expression for the Debye length dependence on DNA dmonomer concentration c : κ η ∝ + − − ⎛ ⎝⎜ ⎞ ⎠⎟ z c c m s 1 1 / 2 ( 7 ) Here , z m = 2 accounts for the two charges a DNA monomer carries and η = 4 . 2 is the Manning condensation factor  only the uncondensed charges form the counterion atmosphere . We also introduced a residual level of salt , c s = 0 . 01 mM . This is due to labeled DNA110 * bu ﬀ er traces in the solutions of DNA146 that we studied and also due to CO 2 dissolved in pure water . Thus , the volume fraction Φ ≈ 0 . 001 c becomes enhanced by a factor ( which is dependent on the DNA concentration due to κ − 1 dependence ) : κ κ Φ = + + − − c L k d k L d 0 . 001 ( / ) ( / ) eff c c 1 1 2 2 ( 8 ) Furthermore , we note that the slope α ( c ) is a function of the DNA fragment aspect ratio p , which now depends on DNA concentration c due to κ − 1 dependence κ κ = + + − − p L k d k ( / ) / ( / ) c eff 1 1 ( 9 ) Combining eqs 6 − 9 into eq 5 , we get an expression where the only free parameter is k . The best ﬁ t of thus corrected eq 5 to our very low salt data set we get for k = 1 . 5 , see Figure 7 . Wilk et al . also found k is between 1 and 2 . Thus , we successfully reproduce the 10 % reduction for D 110 * exp ( DNA146 ) in very low salt conditions compared to values in bu ﬀ er . For a shorter , 20 bp fragment that Wilk et al . studied , the enhanced volume is relatively large ( it depends on κ − 1 / L c ) , thus they observed a stronger reduction of the di ﬀ usion coe ﬃ cient of 20 − 25 % , also reproduced by their ﬁ ts . The ﬁ ts of eq 5 to both D 110 * exp ( DNA146 ) in very low salt conditions and in bu ﬀ er merge above c = 1 − 2 mM ( as well as the experimental data ) , indicating that the volume enhancement due to κ − 1 becomes negligible . Another important feature of D 110 * exp ( DNA146 ) in very low salt conditions is that below c = 0 . 02 mM it increases above D 110 * th . We ascribe this to denaturation of the DNA110 * probe . Naturally , DNA146 should also denature there , but DNA146 concentration is so low that it has no in ﬂ uence on DNA110 * di ﬀ usion . At these very low concentrations DNA dissolved in pure water denatures , as the unscreened Coulomb repulsion of phosphate groups tears the strands apart . 49 Presumably , below c = 0 . 02 mM we are measuring the di ﬀ usion of a mixture of single stranded and double stranded DNA110 * , where single stranded DNA ( ssDNA ) proportion increases as the solution gets diluted . The notion that our DNA110 * / DNA146 solution denatures gradually upon dilution with pure water is primarily supported by the following . The D 110 * exp at the lowest concentrations reaches the value for a ssDNA oligomer 110 bases long , dissolved directly in pure water , without DNA 146 . This ssDNA value may also be compared to the values obtained by Tinland et al . for di ﬀ usion coe ﬃ cients of ssDNA fragments from 280 to 5386 bases long . 50 Figure 7 .

Notably , the heterogeneous systems , DNA110 * / HA and DNA110 * / DNA , show similar behavior , both quantita - tively and qualitatively ( Figure 7 , lower panel ) . Both these also present analogueies with the homogeneous system . First , we note that below c = 1 − 2 mM D 110 * exp ( longDNA ) in 10 mM TE bu ﬀ er is similar to the values for the homogeneous system in bu ﬀ er . This experimental value is similar to the theoretical one , D 110 * th for a freely di ﬀ using 110 bp DNA fragment , see eq 4 . In other words , D 110 * exp in bu ﬀ er is independent of the matrix ( dilute DNA146 fragments or semidilute polydisperse long DNA ) below c = 1 − 2 mM . There the probe DNA110 * di ﬀ uses freely . Second analogy is that the decrease of the di ﬀ usion coe ﬃ cient toward higher concentrations starts for DNA110 * / HA and DNA110 * / DNA above c = 1 − 2 mM just as for DNA110 * / DNA146 , both in low salt and bu ﬀ ered solutions , indicating the e ﬀ ect of the increase in the volume fraction . For a given concentration the volume fraction should be quite similar between the DNA146 , long DNA , and HA systems . Structurally , all the systems may be considered similar ( see Figure 6 ) , since DNA146 is in the semidilute regime above c = 1 − 2 mM , as well as HA and long DNA . The varied magnitudes of D 110 * exp decrease demonstrate di ﬀ erent dynamics of the homogeneous and heterogeneous systems . Eventually , if we extend the ﬁ t for the homogeneous system ( dashed line in Figure 7 , lower panel ) , it will reach similar di ﬀ usion coe ﬃ cient values as for the heterogeneous system about 20 − 30 mM . At these concentrations , also the di ﬀ erence dissappears between very low salt and bu ﬀ ered environments for the heterogeneous , as well as for the homogeneous system . Third analogy is that for the heterogeneous DNA110 * / DNA system , as for the homogeneous DNA110 * / DNA146 system , there is an intermediate concentration region where D 110 * exp in very low salt conditions is reduced in comparison to D 110 * exp in bu ﬀ er ( see Discussion ) . In a ﬁ nal analogy , D 110 * exp for the heterogeneous system DNA110 * / HA , below c = 0 . 02 mM , in very low salt conditions , increases above the theoretical value D 110 * th and reaches the values similar as those for the homogeneous system DNA110 * / DNA146 and also the value for ssDNA 110 bases long . Again , as for the homogeneous system , we ascribe this increase in D 110 * exp to the DNA denaturation . Notably , denaturation of DNA110 * starts in HA solution as well as in DNA146 solution below a rather similar monomer and / or counterion concen - tration . This indicates that the probe DNA110 * stability depends only on the ionic strength of the solution , de ﬁ ned by the counterions coming of the polyions , whether DNA or HA . In brief , diluting either DNA or HA reduces the counterion concentration , thus reduces the screening ( κ − 1 reaches 80 − 100 nm , see Figure 8 ) and leads to DNA110 * denaturation and the consequent increase of D 110 * exp . ■ DISCUSSION Mesh Size . In the Introduction we emphasized that for a polyelectrolyte that appears as highly stretched polyions ( rods ) the least dense way of packing is an isotropic mesh of rods that is characterized by a mesh size ( bn ) − 1 / 2 . Here n is the number concentration of monomers and b is the monomer size of the polyelectrolyte in question . In other words , the mesh size for a rigid polyelectrolyte is simply de ﬁ ned by the total contour length of all the polyions in the solution . However , if the polyion is not so rigid and not all the monomers are charged it may coil . 8 Locally , several monomers carrying a small number of charges would form electrostatic blobs which then carry enough charge to repel each other . The polyion then appears as a rigid chain of such blobs . E ﬀ ective length of such a chain would be shorter than the original polyion contour length  the monomer size would be reduced for a factor : = B A u ( / ) 2 2 / 7 ( 10 ) where A is the number of monomers between the charges and the parameter u = l B / b , a ratio of the Bjerrum length ( see Appendix A ) and the monomer size . Accordingly , the mesh size would increase to ( bn / B ) − 1 / 2 . The validity of this concept has been demonstrated for various ﬂ exible , synthetic polyelectro - lytes by Combet et al . 28 That is , these authors established that the correlation length ξ = 2 π / q m as experimentally obtained by SAXS is equal to the polyelectrolyte concentration dependent mesh cell size given by ( bn / B ) − 1 / 2 . We may consider this concept also for semirigid polyelec - trolytes like DNA and HA . However , in the following we show that the theoretically presumed reduction in the chain length is quite small and also that one electrostatic blob consists of about one monomer of DNA or HA , which renders the concept irrelevant . HA has one charge per monomer ( z m = 1 ; z m is the number of charges on the monomer ) of the length b HA = 1 nm , 27 , 51 which is longer than the Bjerrum length l B = 0 . 72 nm . Thus , the Manning charge density parameter η = z m u = 0 . 7 for HA is smaller than 1 and its counterions do not Manning condense . 6 , 7 Thus , for HA , the factor A equals one . Consequently , eq 10 gives for HA B = 1 . 1 . For DNA , there are two charges per monomer ( z m = 2 ) and b DNA = 0 . 34 nm which gives η = 4 . 2 . Accordingly , about 3 out of 4 counterions are condensed . In other words , only 1 out of 4 charges on DNA remains uncompensated and we get A = 2 , while u = 2 . Thus , for DNA eq 10 gives B = 1 . 2 . Here we note that these corrections to the mesh size would be 5 − 10 % and could be almost within the experimental error . Furthermore , the size of Figure 8 . Correlation length ξ = 2 π / q m calculated from the characteristic wave - vector q m in SAXS intensity and the length scale L DS , obtained by dielectric spectroscopy 18 , 33 ( we considered the MHz range relaxation ) . These techniques cover complementary concen - tration ranges of semidilute DNA and HA solutions . Length scales are shown vs native length scale of the polyelectrolyte , mesh size ( bn ) − 1 / 2 . Here , n is the number concentration of monomers and b is the monomer size , for DNA b = 0 . 34 nm and for HA b = 1 nm . For comparison we also show Debye lengths calculated ( see Appendix A ) for DNA and for HA . Macromolecules Article dx . doi . org / 10 . 1021 / ma3021486 | Macromolecules 2013 , 46 , 1107 − 1118 1113 putative electrostatic blobs in this model is S = bB 3 / 2 ∼ b . In other words , the model has a trivial solution  a single monomer as the electrostatic blob . Also , as DNA and HA structural persistence length is much larger than the monomer size , their polyion chains are certainly extended on the length scale of the electrostatic blob . Indeed , in Figure 8 we show that for DNA the correlation lengths ξ = 2 π / q m , as experimentally obtained by SAXS , are practically equal to the polyelectrolyte concentration dependent mesh cell sizes given by ( bn ) − 1 / 2 . For HA , experimental values ξ = 2 π / q m are close to the 1 . 2 · ( bn ) − 1 / 2 line . We get this despite the fact that HA lacks the SAXS peak routinely obtained for other , highly charged polyelectrolytes . This strongly supports our proposition that the shoulder represents the equivalent of the polyelectrolyte peak for the weak polyelectrolyte HA . Presumably some systematic error , speci ﬁ c for the methodology used in extracting q m from the HA shoulder , caused the correlation lengths to be consistently high by a factor of 1 . 2 . We also note that in the concentration range studied by SAXS the mesh sizes are smaller than the structural persistence lengths of HA or DNA and that the depiction of the solution as an isotropic mesh of rods may well apply . The local structure of the polyelectrolyte mesh can not be studied by SAXS at concentrations below about 3 g / L , as the scattering peak becomes weak and overlaps with the steep intensity upturn at low q . At these low concentrations the mesh size would be signi ﬁ cantly larger than the structural persistence length of the semirigid polyions . A question is whether the polyions may form there an isotropic mesh of rods , i . e . , whether the electrostatic contribution to the persistence length may be su ﬃ cient to keep the polyions and the mesh they form rigid . 27 , 32 , 52 Our previous studies by dielectric spectroscopy ( DS ) 18 , 33 in this lower concentration range have provided a length scale , l that scales as a correlation length , that is l ∝ c − 1 / 2 both for long DNA and HA . If we rescale l obtained either for long DNA or HA for a same factor ( 2 π ) and plot it against the mesh size , we get that 2 π l = L DS = ( bn ) − 1 / 2 . That is , L DS length scale for either DNA or HA falls at the same master line , as does the ξ = 2 π / q m length scale obtained by SAXS , Figure 8 . Here we note that κ − 1 , the Debye screening length which is de ﬁ ned only by the counterions ( see Appendix A ) released from polyions would also scale in the same manner . Indeed , κ − 1 is rather close in absolute value to l : κ − 1 = ( 1 / 4 . 5 ) ( bn ) − 1 / 2 and l = ( 1 / 2 π ) ( bn ) − 1 / 2 . However , our DS studies showed that l does not change upon addition of salt to initially salt free solutions . This strongly indicated that l is not a screening length in nature . Furthermore , this length scale was observed by DS also for a dilute solution of DNA146 fragments where it scaled as l ∝ c − 1 / 3  as the average distance between chains ( see Supporting Information ) . 34 Thus , L DS = 2 π l was identi ﬁ ed as a property of an ensemble of chains  which is a correlation length and not a screening length . Additional analysis regarding the deviation of L DS from ( bn ) − 1 / 2 line for DNA at low concentrations is given in the Supporting Information . To summarize , two complementary studies , the dynamics study and a more conventional structural study of two semirigid polyelectrolytes , DNA and HA , across 4 orders of magnitude in concentration , have provided a single length scale . This length scale spans the range from 3 to 600 nm and equals the mesh size ( bn ) − 1 / 2 of an isotropic mesh of rods . In other words , HA and DNA in very low salt conditions may be consistently regarded as an isotropic mesh of rodlike polyions , across the semidilute concentration range 0 . 01 − 100 g / L . Probing the Mesh . We probed this mesh by observing the di ﬀ usion of a 110 bp DNA fragment with L c ≈ 40 nm . Such a rodlike fragment of an intermediate size provided the opportunity to probe a tight mesh ( mesh sizes smaller than the fragment ) and open mesh ( mesh sizes larger than the fragment ) . In Figure 9 we present the experimentally obtained di ﬀ usion coe ﬃ cients D 110 * exp for DNA110 * either in HA or long DNA , normalized to the theoretical self - di ﬀ usion value at in ﬁ nite dilution . This ratio is then presented vs native length scale of the studied polyelectrolytes , mesh size ( bn ) − 1 / 2 . We also present a ﬁ t to D 110 * exp measured for the probe DNA110 * in DNA146 solution ( in 10 mM bu ﬀ er ) . The ﬁ t is to the occupied volume model that explains rather well the concentration dependence of the di ﬀ usion coe ﬃ cient for the rodlike , charged particles ( see also Figure 7 ) . 47 , 48 We remind that DNA110 * / DNA146 solution is practically monodiperse and is dilute below 1 − 2 mM and thus there the mesh size is not de ﬁ ned ( although the correlation length is  see Supporting Infroma - tion ) . However , we simply transformed the monomer concentration c of DNA110 * / DNA146 into a number concentration n and calculated the corresponding ( bn ) − 1 / 2 values . We take this as a reference for the behavior of D 110 * exp in the mesh formed by long DNA or HA . In Figure 9 we also show D 110 * exp values for the probe DNA110 * without any matrix , either DNA146 , HA or long DNA . The values are given for the Figure 9 . Di ﬀ usion coe ﬃ cient D 110 * exp for 1 . 5 − 2 μ M DNA110 * di ﬀ using in various conditions / solutions , normalized to the theoretical value D 110 * th and shown vs native length scale of the polyelectrolyte , mesh size ( bn ) − 1 / 2 . Data are for DNA110 * in long DNA solutions ( shaded squares ) in 10 mM TE bu ﬀ er and for DNA110 * in long DNA ( open squares ) or HA solutions ( open circles ) in very low salt < 0 . 05 mM conditions . The full line denotes theoretical values for a monodisperse solution of DNA110 *  based on a ﬁ t of eq 5 to D 110 * exp values for DNA110 * / DNA146 in bu ﬀ er ( see Figure 7 ) . The ﬁ t is extrapolated to higher concentrations , i . e . smaller mesh sizes ( dashed line ) . At low concentrations the experimental values and the ﬁ t are equal to D 110 * th , thus DNA110 * label and an arrow denote the value of 1 . The value for a 110 bases long single stranded DNA oligomer ( ssDNA110 * ) diluted directly with pure water is also denoted . Several values of L e , the electrostatic contribution ( OSF model ) to the persistence length are denoted . There is a correspondence ( arrows ) of L e and ( bn ) − 1 / 2 as both depend on the monomer concentration . Macromolecules Article dx . doi . org / 10 . 1021 / ma3021486 | Macromolecules 2013 , 46 , 1107 − 1118 1114 probe in double stranded ( DNA110 * ) as well as in the single stranded form ( ssDNA110 * ) . First , we address the properties of the mesh in the ﬁ nite ionic strength conditions , where we studied only DNA110 * / long DNA heterogeneous system . When the mesh size formed by the long , polydisperse DNA chains is larger than the contour length ( L c ≈ 40 nm ) of the probe DNA110 fragment , the probe di ﬀ uses freely  D 110 * exp is similar , within the experimental error to the theoretical self - di ﬀ usion coe ﬃ cient value , as well as to the experimental one obtained for DNA110 * at very high dilution . D 110 * exp ( long DNA ) is independent of the mesh size , from 50 to 60 nm up to 600 nm ( corresponds to 1 − 0 . 01 mM DNA monomer concentration ) . In analogy to the homoge - neous DNA110 * / DNA146 system , the ionic strength of 10 mM TE bu ﬀ er is su ﬃ cient to reduce the Debye length and the thickness of the counterion atmosphere to the levels where the atmosphere does not contribute signi ﬁ cantly to the occupied volume  thus there is no reduction in D 110 * exp below D 110 * th . On the other hand , when the mesh size becomes comparable to DNA110 * size , we observe a decrease of D 110 * exp ( long DNA ) , presumably due to the occupied volume e ﬀ ects , as for the DNA110 * / DNA146 system . The occupied volume should be similar between the long polydisperse DNA and DNA146 , as the counterion concentrations and thus the counterion atmosphere thickness is the same . However , D 110 * exp decrease occurs more steeply in DNA110 * / long DNA than for DNA110 * / DNA146 . Also , structurally , both systems are similar there  DNA146 solution ( matrix of DNA110 * / DNA146 system ) is semidilute when the correlation length / mesh size is smaller than its contour length , 50 nm and the scattering experiments do not distinguish the two semidilute systems ( see Figure 6 ) . We may speculate here on in ﬂ uence of the mesh formed by the long DNA molecules . The rigid mesh  here the mesh size becomes smaller than the structural persistence length of DNA  could present an additional obstacle for the probe DNA . We will elaborate on this in ﬂ uence further below . Eventually , for the mesh size of 15 − 20 nm , all data sets appear to converge , as well as the extrapolation of DNA110 * / DNA146 ﬁ t . Presumably , the occupied volume e ﬀ ects dominate here and this regime may be understood as the crowded environment . 29 , 30 Second , we argue that our data show that , in semidilute solution , the polyions in very low salt conditions may form a rigid mesh that presents an additional obstacle to probe molecule di ﬀ usion . This e ﬀ ect is in addition to the e ﬀ ect of the polyion chain occupied volume enhancement due to counter - ion atmosphere expansion in very low salt conditions . The latter e ﬀ ect explains quite well the di ﬀ usion coe ﬃ cient of our probe DNA110 * in the matrix of monodisperse DNA146 both in very low salt conditions and in bu ﬀ er . For the semidilute polydisperse matrix of DNA or HA we observed a signi ﬁ cant , 50 % reduction of D 110 * exp in very low salt in comparison to D 110 * exp in bu ﬀ er , while the enhanced volume occupied by the polyions may account for only 10 % of this reduction , as we have seen for the homogeneous DNA110 * / DNA146 system . Also , in very low salt conditions the mesh has to be about 3 times larger than the probe length ( Figure 10 ) in order for D 110 * exp only to start to rise toward D 110 * th . Eventually , in a very open , 400 nm mesh DNA110 * is able to di ﬀ use freely in very low salt conditions . On the contrary , when in bu ﬀ er , DNA110 * is able to di ﬀ use freely already in 60 nm mesh  this mesh size is just slightly larger than the probe ( 40 nm ) . We remind that the mesh size is fundamentally a geometrical property of a solution of a given concetration  it does not tell on the e . g . ﬂ exibility of polyions . An interesting issue is how the structure and dynamics of the mesh formed by the polymer change with the persistence length of the chains . Polyelec - trolytes with their electrostatics dependent persistence length present an interesting case . In the very low salt conditions the Debye length and thus the electrostatic contribution to the persistence length , L e ( OSF model , see Appendix A ) are controlled by the counterion concentration . Henceforth , for a given monomer concentration c and the related mesh size ( bn ) − 1 / 2 one may calculate a Debye length κ − 1 and the corresponding L e ∝ κ − 2 value . The values L e are denoted vs mesh size in Figure 9 . Already Hayter et al . 44 discussed that the electrostatic persistence length de ﬁ ned only by counterions in the salt free conditions would be dominant over the persistence length de ﬁ ned by the random collisions between one chain and its neigbours . Experimentally , the electrostatic contribution L e was studied both for DNA and HA . 27 , 31 , 53 From these works , it is apparent that for DNA and HA solutions in very low salt conditions the total persistence Figure 10 . Polyelectrolyte mesh formed by DNA , mesh size ( bn ) − 1 / 2 ≈ 100 − 150 nm at 0 . 3 mM ( in base pairs ) . In the very low salt conditions , for the mesh to open completely , i . e . , the DNA fragment to reach the free di ﬀ usion coe ﬃ cient values , the mesh size ( edge of the cube ) needs to become even larger ( 300 − 400 nm compared to the fragment length L c ≈ 40 nm ) . In a solution of ﬁ nite ionic strength the mesh opens immediately when the mesh size becomes larger than the fragment length . The thickness of the counterion atmosphere is comparable to the Debye length κ − 1 and de ﬁ nes the enhanced occupied volume ( shaded cylinders ) of the polyions . In the very low salt conditions κ − 1 is de ﬁ ned only by the counterions ( small spheres ) and scales with the mesh size but it is quite smaller , κ − 1 ≈ ( 1 / 5 ) ( bn ) − 1 / 2 . Macromolecules Article dx . doi . org / 10 . 1021 / ma3021486 | Macromolecules 2013 , 46 , 1107 − 1118 1115 length would be comparable or larger than the mesh size across the studied concentration range . On the other hand , 10 mM bu ﬀ er is quite enough to reduce the persistence length to its structural value 27 , 31 , 53  for our DNA and HA systems in the bu ﬀ er the persistence length is smaller than the mesh size across most of the studied concentration range . As an illustration , in Figure 10 , we present the isotropic solution of rodlike DNA molecules ( c = 0 . 3 mM ) and their counterion atmospheres . At this concentration ( 0 . 3 mM ) , the mesh size should be 125 nm and DNA total persistence length 200 nm ( due to very low salt conditions ) . Thus , on the level of the mesh cell DNA may be considered rodlike . The mesh size , probe length , and the thickness of the counterion atmosphere are shown to scale , illustrating that the occupied volume , even when enhanced by the atmosphere does not present a signi ﬁ cant portion of the total available volume for di ﬀ usion of the probe DNA110 * . The occupied volume signi ﬁ cantly in ﬂ uences the di ﬀ usion only for a tight mesh , where DNA110 * probe is larger than the mesh size . There , however , the counterion concentration is high enough and the atmosphere thin enough that there is no distinction between systems in bu ﬀ er or in very low salt . The distinction between the heterogeneous and homogeneous systems also disappears there as both systems are in the semidilute regime . DNA Denaturation . The denaturation mechanism that a ﬀ ects probe DNA110 * should also a ﬀ ect DNA146 and long DNA . For the homogeneous DNA110 * / DNA146 system we identify denaturation of DNA110 * from the increase in D 110 * exp below 0 . 02 mM . DNA146 solution may be taken as in ﬁ nitely dilute below the concentration where the ﬁ ts in Figure 7 merge  the occupied volume has no in ﬂ uence anymore . Thus , D 110 * exp re ﬂ ects only DNA110 * shape / conformation and indeed , ssDNA has a larger di ﬀ usion coe ﬃ cient . Presumably , DNA146 denatures at similar concentrations as DNA110 * , as the stability of DNA sequence is also related to its length . 54 For the heterogeneous system DNA110 * / long DNA and DNA110 * / HA a pronounced D 110 * exp increase starts already below 0 . 2 mM ( Figure 7 , lower panel ) . As this increase is common for both heterogeneous systems , in principle it could only be due to a change in some common property . E . g . , it could be a property of DNA110 * present in both systems . However , we established just above that DNA110 * denatura - tion only starts below 0 . 02 mM and may not be the origin of this increase . The only other common property of the two heterogeneous systems is the mesh size . Therefore , we argued that the said increase is due to opening of the mesh , Figure 9 . Notwithstanding , we note that D 110 * exp increase for DNA110 * / long DNA system starts only for 150 nm mesh size and for DNA110 * / HA already for 100 nm mesh size . This slight di ﬀ erence may easily be within our experimental error , but the data points for long DNA do remain shifted , for a factor about 1 . 5 , to higher mesh size values , throughout the increase range . This may be interpreted in the following manner . If long DNA denatures already in this region , it would present , for a given concentration n , a slightly tighter mesh than we calculated for the abscissa of Figure 9 . That is , the number of chains and thus monomers doubles when strands break apart and monomer size b is also somewhat larger for single strands ( 0 . 43 − 0 . 5 nm instead of 0 . 34 nm 50 ) . Therefore , ( bn ) dsDNA − 1 / 2 ≈ 1 . 7 · ( bn ) ssDNA − 1 / 2 . This factor is very close to our estimate for the shift factor just above . While this analysis is speculative and the shift may well be due to an experimental error we also point to a feature in the dielectric spectroscopy data ( see Supporting Information ) that occurs in similar concentration range for the same long DNA samples ( polydisperse salmon DNA ) . We take this as yet another indication of our long DNA samples denaturation below 0 . 2 mM . However , such a scenario where long DNA molecules would be less stable than short DNA fragments is in contradiction with studies showing that DNA will denature more easily if it is of shorter length . 54 Nevertheless , the issue of long DNA denaturation has no consequence on our argument that the pronounced D 110 * exp increase observed for heterogeneous systems is due to the mesh size becoming considerably larger ( 100 − 150 nm ) than DNA110 * fragment size ( 40 nm ) . ■ CONCLUSION We remind the reader that the addition of salt suppresses the principal experimental feature of the semidilute polyelectro - lytes , the SAXS correlation peak . This is due to the salt induced screening of the Coulomb interaction and the consequent suppression of the correlation hole around the chains . This change in solution structure ( as if it melts away ) occurs for rather high added salt levels of 0 . 1 − 1 M . Upon addition of salt , the density of chains does not change and the mesh size parameter itself should stay the same . It is only the correlation between the chains ( the structure of the mesh ) that goes away with the reduction in the counterion atmosphere extent due to added salt . The apparent di ﬀ erence in salt e ﬀ ect on structure and on the dynamics stems from the following : the counterion atmosphere contracts proportionally to κ − 1 ( de ﬁ ned by the added salt ) while the OSF electrostatic contribution to the persistence length of chains goes away much sooner with κ − 2 . So the mesh of rigid chains softens at 10 mM but the correlations among chains  the distinctive structure of the polyelectrolyte solution remain even above 0 . 1 M ionic strength . In brief , in this work we probed the mesh formed by the semidilute solutions of semirigid polyelectrolytes . The basis for this study was to establish the equivalence between the correlation length obtained both from a structural method ( SAXS ) and a dynamics study ( DS ) and a simple geometrical parameter of the mesh size , across a broad concentration range . We established this both for DNA and HA , despite that HA lacks the characteristic polyelectrolyte peak in SAXS intensity curves . Having the size of the mesh measured , we probed the mesh by studying how the di ﬀ usion coe ﬃ cient of a DNA fragment ( of length comparable to the mesh size ) deviates from its free di ﬀ usion value . It appeared that a mesh of similar properties is formed by a strong polyelectrolyte DNA and a weak polyelectrolyte HA in salt free solutions . In these salt free conditions electrostatic contribution to the persistence length is higher than the mesh size and HA and DNA polyions are rendered highly rigid . Thus , formed rigid mesh signi ﬁ cantly impedes the di ﬀ usion of the probe fragment . Addition of salt softens the mesh , by reducing the persistence length below the mesh size and impedance to fragments di ﬀ usion is removed . We consider this e ﬀ ect ( observed by studying the dynamics ) , to be complementary to the disappearance of the polyelectrolyte peak in SAXS intensity curves ( a static , structural study ) upon addition of salt .

Screening Length . When we try to understand the distribution and thickness of the counterion atmosphere of a polyion , we use the concept of screening length ( s ) which depend on the ionic concentration and composition , e . g . Debye − Hu ̈ ckel screening length κ ε ε = − − ⎛ ⎝⎜ ⎞ ⎠⎟ k T e I 2 R s 1 0 B2 1 / 2 1 / 2 ( 11 ) Here ε 0 is the permittivity of the vacuum , ε R is the relative dielectric constant of the solvent , k B is the Boltzmann constant , T is the temperature , e is the electron charge and I s is the ionic strength of the solution . In order to estimate κ − 1 for a polyelectrolyte without added salt , we take into account only the concentration of the counterions c i and their valency z i , so I s = c i z i 2 . Concentration of counterions stems from the monomer concentration , c of the polyelectrolyte , i . e . , c i = cz m / z i , where z m is the number of charges a monomer carries ( for double stranded DNA , z m = 2 , while for HA it is 1 ) . Bjerrum Length . The electrostatic interaction of two monovalent ions in a dielectric medium is comparable to k B T at a distance l B = ( e 2 / ( 4 πε 0 ε R k B T ) ) . In water , the Bjerrum length is l B = 0 . 72 nm . In other words , in water two monovalent ions e ﬀ ectively cease to interact beyond this distance . Chain Size . A polyion of a polymerization degree N , with monomer size b , has a contour length L c = Nb . Chain size R is the measure of the maximum spatial extent of the polyion chain . It is smaller than the contour length if the polyion is coiled . The minimum extent occurs if the polyion is so ﬂ exible that each of its monomers may be regarded as a step in a random walk , then R = bN 1 / 2 . Persistence Length . L p is a measure of the sti ﬀ ness of the polymer chain . In a polyelectrolyte , the total persistence length L p = L 0 + L e is a combination of the structural L 0 and the electrostatic contribution L e . The latter is due to the Coulombic repulsion of the charged groups found along the chain , which renders the chain more rigid and tends to extend it . As this interaction is screened by the added salt the models for L e must include the added salt concentration , usually via κ − 1 . 52 A frequently used model to calculate L e is Odijk - Skolnick - Fixman model : 55 , 56 L e = ( 1 / ( 4 κ 2 l B ) ) . The electrostatic contribution may easily surpass the structural one in very low salt conditions . A polyion will behave as a rod if the persistence length is comparable to the contour length , L p ≈ L c . Dilute Solution , Polyelectrolyte concentration is so low that the polyions are set apart , i . e . their average distance d is larger than the chain size or the contour length , L c of a polyion . An average volume taken by a polyion scales inversely with polyion concentration d 3 ∝ 1 / c p . The latter is related to c , the monomer concentration − c p = c / N and thus d = ( c / N ) − 1 / 3 . 14 , 17 , 25 Dilute − Semidilute Crossover Concentration . As the polyelec - trolyte concentration is raised , the average distance gets reduced and eventually becomes comparable to the chain size or the contour length of the polyion , d ≈ L c . This occurs at a crossover concentration c * = N / L c 3 . Semidilute Solution . Polyions start to overlap . The principal characteristic of a semidilute solution is that there is no way to distinguish whether two neigboring polyion segments , belong to the same chain or di ﬀ erent ones  in other words , the chains lose identity . Correspondingly , average distance between the chains or chain size , as well as the contour length are not relevant length scales to describe a semidilute solution . de Gennes Correlation Length . For a semidilute solution , any relevant length scale ξ should scale in some manner with polyelectrolyte ( monomer ) concentration , ξ ∝ c m , and not with the chain size R or polymerization degree N . Such a length scale should also become , at the crossover concentration c * , comparable to chain size R , where the latter is comparable to the distance between the chains d . Therefore , we should have ξ ∝ R ( c / c * ) m . Since R ≈ d ≈ L c = Nb and c * = N / L c 3 , we need to set the exponent m = − 1 / 2 to avoid dependence of ξ on N . Thus , we get a length scale relevant for describing a semidilute solution which scales with the square root of the monomer concentration , ξ ∝ c − 1 / 2 . This scaling approach was introduced by de Gennes et al . 20 in association with the isotropic phase model . ■ APPENDIX B Experimental details of dielectric spectroscopy ( DS ) technique applied to long DNA or HA samples are described in more detail elsewhere . 18 , 33 As DS results are an important reference here we describe the technique in the following . In brief , a sample solution droplet of 100 μ L is applied between platinum electrodes of a homemade capacitive chamber . The chamber is closed and connected to the temperature control unit and the Agilent 4294A precision impedance analyzer which operates in the frequency range 100 Hz - 100 MHz . The complex conductivity spectrum of the sample is subtracted for the spectrum of NaCl solution with a similar free ionic conductivity . The resulting spectrum is converted into the complex dielectric function and ﬁ tted in a complex plane . The principal ﬁ t parameter of interest here is the mean relaxation time τ 0 . Figure 11 . External electric ﬁ eld induces a dipole formed by the polyion and the counterion atmosphere . Dipoles induced perpendic - ular or along the polyion chain would have di ﬀ erent relaxation times , due to di ﬀ erent length scales involved . Macromolecules Article dx . doi . org / 10 . 1021 / ma3021486 | Macromolecules 2013 , 46 , 1107 − 1118 1117 That is , the applied small ac electric ﬁ eld induces a dipole formed by counterion atmosphere oscillating in relation to the polyion , Figure 11 . The relaxation time τ 0 of the induced dipole necessarily corresponds to their size . , i . e . to the associated length scale L via Einstein − Smoluchowski di ﬀ usion equation L 2 ∝ τ 0 D in , where D in is the di ﬀ usion constant of counterions . 57 The equation is applied since the counterion displacements take place by di ﬀ usive motion . ■ ASSOCIATED CONTENT * S Supporting Information More detailed discussion of the features of the scattering intensity curves for HA , further arguments for the length scale obtained by dielectric spectroscopy to be the correlation length , as well as the fact that it attains realistic values when rescaled by 2 π .
