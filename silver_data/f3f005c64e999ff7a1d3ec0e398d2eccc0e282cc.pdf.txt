We carried out genome - wide quantitative analysis of alternative splicing using a custom Affymetrix microarray to assess the role of the neuronal splicing factor Nova in the brain . We used a stringent algorithm to identify 591 exons that were differentially spliced in the brain relative to immune tissues , and 6 . 6 % of these showed major splicing defects in the neocortex of Nova2 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice . We tested 49 exons with the largest predicted Nova - dependent splicing changes and validated all 49 by RT - PCR . We analyzed the encoded proteins and found that all those with deﬁned brain functions acted in the synapse ( 34 of 40 , including neurotransmitter receptors , cation channels , adhesion and scaffold proteins ) or in axon guidance ( 8 of 40 ) . Moreover , of the 35 proteins with known interaction partners , 74 % ( 26 ) interact with each other . Validating a large set of Nova RNA targets has led us to identify a multi - tiered network in which Nova regulates the exon content of RNAs encoding proteins that interact in the synapse . Human cells contain B 20 , 000 – 25 , 000 genes 1 , which would generate a proteome of limited complexity if each gene produced one protein . Alternative RNA splicing is believed to be a primary means of increasing proteome complexity 2 and thereby functional diversity , an issue of particular importance in the brain and immune system . The mechanisms and importance of splicing regulation in mammalian tissues are poorly understood in comparison with the well - explored signaling pathways that regulate transcription of functionally coherent sets of genes 3 – 6 . Understanding the biologic role of alternative splicing has been impeded by the difﬁculty in systematically identifying and validating transcripts that are coregulated by speciﬁc splicing factors 7 . A few studies have reported splicing defects of small numbers of transcripts in mice lacking RNA - binding proteins 8 – 11 , but no study has undertaken a genome - wide analysis to address statistically the functional coherence of genes coregulated at the level of alternative splicing . Microarrays using exon - junction probes were used ﬁrst for genome - wide analysis in yeast 12 and then to detect alternative splicing differences in mammalian tissues with a validity rate of B 50 % ( ref . 13 ) to 70 – 85 % ( refs . 14 , 15 ) . The ﬁrst mammalian tissue - speciﬁc splicing factors described were Nova1 and Nova2 , neuron - speciﬁc KH - type RNA binding pro - teins 8 , 16 , 17 . A limited set of validated Nova splicing targets have been identiﬁed through a series of experiments involving Nova - RNA structural studies 18 , 19 , Nova knockout mice 8 , RNA cross - linking and immunoprecipitation ( CLIP ) to determine sites of Nova - RNA contact in vivo 9 and biochemical analysis of Nova - regulated splicing 20 , 21 . Taken together , these studies suggested that Nova might preferentially target RNAs encoding proteins with roles in neuronal inhibition 9 . To address this hypothesis systematically , we undertook a genome - wide screen to identify and validate Nova - dependent alternatively spliced transcripts in brain . RESULTSQuantitative analysis of tissue - speciﬁc splicing We analyzed alternative splicing in brains of Nova2 (cid:1) / (cid:1) and Nova1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice using a custom Affymetrix microarray previously developed as a prototype to quantify splicing changes of TPM2 and CD44 in human tissues 22 . The microarray contained 40 , 443 exon junction probe sets derived from 7 , 175 genes with one or more bioinformatically predicted alternative transcripts . To analyze the data , we developed a simple algorithm ( called analysis of splicing by isoform reciprocity , ASPIRE ) to identify reciprocal splicing changes between two samples ( normalized to steady - state levels ; Fig . 1 and Supplementary Fig . 1 online ) . This approach allowed us to identify changes in alternative splicing with high sensitivity and to discriminate them from changes in RNA stability . Data were quantiﬁed as the change in the fraction of exon inclusion ( D I ) , where a D I value of 0 . 5 indicates a 50 % increase and a D I value of (cid:1) 0 . 5 indicates a 50 % decrease in exon inclusion in the ﬁrst of the two compared samples .

To deﬁne a limit for signiﬁcant D I values , we analyzed tissues that were not expected to show splicing changes ; we compared neocortex in wild - type versus Nova1 knockout mice and thymus in wild - type versus Nova2 knock - out mice , because neocortex does not express Nova1 ( ref . 17 ) and thymus does not express Nova2 . In this analysis we found only one change of | D I | 4 0 . 20 that occurred in both comparisons ( average | D I | E 0 . 05 , R 2 ¼ 0 . 03 ; Fig . 2a ) . Therefore , we used a cutoff of | D I | 4 0 . 20 for further analysis . We compared splicing in brain with splicing in immune tissues and identiﬁed 1 , 239 changes with | D I | 4 0 . 2 that were common to both spinal cord – thymus and midbrain - thymus compar - isons ( average | D I | E 0 . 23 , R 2 ¼ 0 . 94 ; Fig . 2b ) . When we expanded this analysis to compare splicing in all brain regions with splicing in either thymus or spleen , we found that 12 % ( 591 of 4 , 776 ) of exons showed the same differential splicing pattern in all comparisons ( | D I | 4 0 . 2 ; Supplementary Figs . 2 and 3 online ) . This observation supports predictions of previous studies 13 , 14 that different brain regions share a pattern of alternative splicing regulation and that this pattern is distinct from that seen in other tissues . These data raise the question of what role neuronal RNA binding proteins have in brain - speciﬁc RNA regulation . Nova2 regulates B 7 % of brain - speciﬁc splicing in the neocortex Expression of Nova1 and Nova2 is restricted to the central nervous system 16 . In postnatal brain , their expression is largely reciprocal , most obviously in the neocortex where Nova2 is nearly exclusively expressed 17 . We undertook pairwise comparisons between two bio - logic triplicate samples of neocortex from wild - type and Nova2 knock - out mice . We found 53 exons with | D I | 4 0 . 20 in both samples ( Fig . 2c ) . Moreover , all 41 exons with D I 4 0 . 24 in one triplicate correlated ( R 2 ¼ 0 . 94 ) with predicted changes in the second triplicate ( Fig . 2d and Supplementary Fig . 3 online ) . These splicing changes did not follow a normal distribution but affected a speciﬁc subset of alternative exons ( kurtosis 4 3 ; Fig . 2e ) . In other sample comparisons , the broad spectrum of splicing changes fell on a normal distribution a c b WT KO / WT KO 12 - 12a 12 - 13 P r obe s e t P r obe Exon ∆ inclusion Exonskipping 0 1 Low High 12 - 12a 12 - 13 Steadystate 13 - 14 12 13 14 12 - 13 13 - 14 12 12a 13 14 12 - 12a 13 - 14 F r a c t i on o f t o t a l 12 - 12a 12 - 13 639639 600 R2 = 0 . 94 R 2 = 0 . 94 17 24 N u m be r o f e x on s – 0 . 8 – 0 . 4 0 0 . 4 0 . 8 – 0 . 8 – 0 . 4 0 WT vs .

( a , b ) A schematic representation of Aplp2 alternative isoforms , in which each exon junction and exon body are tiled with probes ( as shown in Supple - mentary Fig . 1 online ) . Each alternatively spliced transcript includes probes that recognize the constitutive regions shared between the two reciprocal isoforms ( e . g . , junction 13 - 14 ) and probes that recognize the alternative regions of the exon 12a - including isoform ( e . g . , junction 12 - 12a ) and the exon 12a - skipping isoform ( e . g . , junction 12 - 13 ) . ( c ) A heat map shows the log intensities of three probe sets used for calculation of Aplp2 exon 12a inclusion in wild - type ( WT ) and Nova2 (cid:1) / (cid:1) ( KO ) neocortex . The average signal of all the constitutive probe sets ( such as 13 - 14 ) was used to calculate the steady - state change and to normalize the signals of the alternative probe sets . The signal of the probe sets recognizing the two reciprocal isoforms changes in opposite direction when exon 12a inclusion decreases in the knockout sample relative to the wild - type sample . The algorithm to calculate the change in fraction of exon inclusion ( D I ) is based on the decrease in probe set 12 - 12a and increase in probe set 12 - 13 normalized signals between the two compared samples ( wild - type versus knockout ) .

( a – d ) The splicing changes ( D I ) from one sample comparison are plotted against changes from a second sample comparison to analyze the fraction of data with shared variance ( R 2 ) . Blue boxes and numbers indicate the exons with splicing changes in both samples ( | D I | o 0 . 2 ) . Comparisons include a negative control ( a ) , a positive control ( b ) and comparison of changes detected in two independent sets of triplicate wild - type ( WT ) versus Nova2 knockout ( KO ) neocortex samples . A conservative subset of these changes are highlighted in d by showing only exons with | D I | 4 0 . 24 in the ﬁrst triplicate sample . ( e ) The distribution of exons as a function of splicing change ( D I ) . The distribution of D I was divided into intervals of 0 . 02 width , from D I of (cid:1) 0 . 6 to + 0 . 6 ( corresponding to decreased or increased exon inclusion in the ﬁrst of the two samples , respectively ) . Each point represents the number of exons in an interval . Kurtosis ( k ) is a mathematical depiction of the size of a distribution’s tails ; k 4 3 represents a distribution with signiﬁcant outliers ; k r 3 represent normal distributions . Blue shading marks the signiﬁcant outliers in the distribution of wild - type versus Nova2 knockout neocortex splicing changes .

The distribution of splicing changes in neocortex in wild - type versus Nova2 knockout mice ( kurtosis ¼ 7 . 8 ) indicates that a few transcripts are changed owing to one crucial factor , the absence of Nova2 ( Fig . 2e ) , rather than a combination of multiple indirect factors . We used RT - PCR as an independent assay to examine splicing changes with predicted | D I | 4 0 . 2 in both triplicate wild - type versus Nova2 knockout neocortex experiments ( n ¼ 53 ; Fig . 2c ) . We identiﬁed 36 such exons in well - characterized transcripts ( excluding ESTand RIKEN sequences ) and obtained RT - PCR data for 35 of them ( Fig . 3 , Table 1 and Supplementary Fig . 4 online ) . We also tested 14 exons with less robust changes ( | D I | Z 0 . 15 in at least one experiment ; Table 1 ) . RT - PCR results for all 49 exons conﬁrmed the direction and magnitude of splicing change predicted by the microarray , with a high statistical correlation between the quantitative predictions of the two methods ( R 2 ¼ 0 . 89 ; Fig . 3d and Table 1 ) . The ability to predict splicing changes with this accuracy depended on the ASPIRE techni - que , because traditional statistical methods yielded much lower rates of predicting validated splicing changes ( 39 % by ANOVA and 20 % by PAC 22 ; data not shown ) . The average change in the percentage of exon inclusion detected by RT - PCR in wild - type versus Nova2 knockout neocortex was 40 % ( D I ¼ 0 . 4 ; Fig . 3e ) . When measured as relative change in the ratio of reciprocal alternative isoforms , 45 % of changes were greater than tenfold and 78 % were greater than ﬁvefold ( Fig . 3f and Table 1 ) . As a control , we found that 37 of 39 exons predicted to be unchanged ( | D I | o 0 . 1 ) in wild - type versus Nova2 knockout neocortex or Nova1 spinal cord were also unchanged in RT - PCR analysis ( | D I | o 0 . 1 ) , and 2 showed small changes ( 0 . 1 o | D I | r 0 . 15 ; Table 1 ) . In conclusion , all the exons with large predicted change ( | D I | 4 0 . 2 ) and 95 % of the exons with no predicted change ( | D I | o 0 . 1 ) could be validated by RT - PCR . Previous studies suggested that Nova has an important role in regulating brain - speciﬁc splicing of several transcripts 8 , 9 , 20 , 21 . Of the 49 Nova2 - regulated transcripts validated in this study , 31 are expressed both in brain and in immune tissues . Of these , 97 % ( 30 / 31 ) have the same splicing pattern in Nova2 (cid:1) / (cid:1) neocortex as in immune tissues , suggesting that Nova2 promotes brain - speciﬁc splicing ( Table 1 and Fig . 3a , b ) . We also reanalyzed the full set of 591 exons that were differentially spliced in brain relative to immune tissues and found that 6 . 6 % ( 39 of 591 ) were Nova - dependent ( ( | D I | wild - type versus Nova2 knockout neocortex ) 4 ( | D I | brain versus thymus ) / 2 ; Supple - mentary Fig . 5 online ) . Although we did not analyze other nonbrain tissues , our results suggest that Nova helps establish B 7 % of differ - ential splicing in the brain . Strategies for Nova - dependent regulation of splicing Previous studies found that Nova is able to regulate splicing of cassette or mutually exclusive exons 8 , 9 , 20 . Here we identiﬁed a number of additional ways in which Nova regulates alternative splicing . Examples among validated Nova2 target RNAs include upregulated use of a terminal exon and an alternative 3 ¢ slice site ( Gpr45 exon 2 and Idh3b exon 12 , respectively ) , as well as downregulated use of alternative 3 ¢ and 5 ¢ splice sites ( Ank3 exon 17 and Ncdn exon 1 , respectively ; Table 1 and Supplementary Fig . 6 online ) . We also identiﬁed instances where Nova2 regulated two distant ( 7 – 40 kb apart ) alter - natively spliced exons in the same pre - mRNA ( Falz exons 4 and 9 ) ; in some cases , the two exons are regulated in opposite directions ( Chl1 exons 7a and 24 ; Epim exons 8 and 10 ; Table 1 ) . These data indicate that Nova regulates splice - site selection by a variety of mechanisms and , in some cases , may coordinately regulate different functions of a single gene . We analyzed Nova - dependent splicing regulation in different brain regions . Of the 49 exons with validated splicing change in wild - type versus Nova2 knockout neocortex , 33 also had predicted splicing changes in all other Nova2 (cid:1) / (cid:1) brain regions ( Supplementary Figs . 1 and 3 online ) . Furthermore , 7 of the 49 validated Nova2 target exons also had predicted splicing change in wild - type versus Nova1 knockout spinal cord , cerebellum and midbrain ( validated by RT - PCR ; | D I | 4 0 . 10 ; Table 1 ) . An example is the Nova - dependent regulation of exon 12a of Aplp2 ( Fig . 4 and Supplementary Fig . 1 online ) . The effects seen in Nova2 (cid:1) / (cid:1) and Nova1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) spinal cord , cerebellum and midbrain are attenuated ( relative to wild - type versus Nova2 knockout neocortex ) , an effect that may be due to redundant action of the two Nova proteins . – 20 – 10 0 10 20 R e l a t i v e c hange 0 . 0 1 . 0 APLP2 PLC β 4 NMDA R1 0 . 0 1 . 0 39 38 - 40 18 - 20 19 0 . 0 1 . 0 12 - 12a 12 - 13 Nova1 Nova2 Nova2 WT KO WT KO WT KO WT KO WT KO WT KO Neocortex Spinalcord Spleen Neocortex Spinalcord Spleen Nova1 Nova2 Nova2 NA F r a c t i on F r a c t i on F r a c t i on NA d e f c b a – 0 . 8 – 0 . 4 0 0 . 4 0 . 8 – 0 . 8 – 0 . 4 0 0 . 4 0 . 8 R 2 = 0 . 89 F r a c t i on o f e x on i n c l u s i on ( I ) WT Splicing microarray ( ∆ l ) R T - P CR ( ∆ l ) KO downregulated upregulated 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 39 12 13 13 12 18 20 20 18 12a 38 40 40 38 19 downregulated upregulated Figure 3 Validation of microarray data by RT - PCR .

These encode NMDA NR1 subunit ( Fig . 3c ) , KCNQ2 potassium channel , serine racemase , Hsc40 and Arhgap21 ( Table 1 ) . These observations suggest that , in addition to regulating brain - speciﬁc splicing , in some cases Nova also con - tributes to differential splicing between brain regions . Nova regulates splicing of RNAs encoding synaptic functions To examine the types of function encoded by Nova - regulated tran - scripts , we used the program GoMiner 23 , which allowed us to apply statistical measures to this analysis . We used an improved version of GoMiner that replicates genes by the number of regulated alternative exons in the gene and carries out multiple sample comparisons to determine the false discovery rate ( FDR ) 24 . These studies suggested that Nova preferentially regulates transcripts encoding proteins that function in the synapse . We compared the gene functions associated with Nova - regulated exons ( n ¼ 48 ; Table 1 ) with those associated with the complete set of microarray alternative exons from genes expressed in brain ( n ¼ 2 , 710 ) . Functions with the most signiﬁcant enrichment among Nova - regulated transcripts ( P o 0 . 001 , FDR o 0 . 03 , 6 - to 13 - fold enrichment ; Table 2 ) were synapse biogenesis and synaptic transmission , cell - cell signaling , cortical actin organization ( i . e . , arrangement of actin just beneath the plasma membrane ) , cell adhesion and extracellular matrix organization . Notably , all these proteins act at the cell membrane , most often at the cell - cell junctions , suggesting they may all act in the synapse . Other enriched functions ( P o 0 . 02 , FDR o 0 . 2 , three - to sixfold enrichment ; Table 2 ) were also synapse - related , including ion transport , regulation of synaptic plasticity , regulation of cell shape , axonogenesis and neurite morpho - genesis . We also examined the relative representation of exons in 14 biological functions ( representing 72 % ( 35 of 48 ) of the validated Nova targets and 61 % ( 242 of 397 ) of the exons differentially spliced between brain and immune tissues ) . We found that 88 % of the Nova - regulated exons , compared with only 24 % of the control exons , encode synapse - related functions ( P o 0 . 01 ; Fig . 4 ) . By contrast , only 8 % of Nova - regulated genes , compared with 68 % of control exons , encode proteins that are not identiﬁed as acting directly in the synapse according to Gene Ontology annotation ( Fig . 4 ) .

Six hundred and ﬁfty Gene Ontology categories had 15 – 400 total exons , and we show all those ( barring redundant ontologies ) for which statistically signiﬁcant results were obtained ( FDR o 0 . 16 , P o 0 . 02 ) . The signiﬁcance of enrichment in experimental relative to control set is indicated by P value ( one - sided Fisher exact test ) and FDR ( P value corrected for multiple comparisons ) . The total number of exons from genes expressed in brain ( total ) , the 48 Nova regulated exons ( wild - type ( WT ) versus Nova2 knockout ( KO ) neocortex ) validated here and in previous studies 8 , 9 , and the exons with predicted differential splicing in brain versus immune tissues ( | D I | 4 0 . 2 in all possible comparisons ) or in spleen versus thymus ( | D I | 4 0 . 24 ) are shown . Comparison of regulation by alternative splicing and by steady state is shown in Supplementary Table 2 online . 848 VOLUME 37 [ NUMBER 8 [ AUGUST 2005 NATURE GENETICS A R T I C L E S © 2005 N a t u r e P ub li s h i ng G r oup h tt p : / / ww w . n a t u r e . c o m / n a t u r e g e n e t i cs Because the Gene Ontology annotation is incomplete , we searched PubMed and identiﬁed clearly deﬁned brain - related functions for 40 of the 49 proteins encoded by Nova target transcripts validated in this study . Although multiple functions are ascribed to many of these proteins , 85 % ( 34 of 40 ) function in synaptic transmission and plasticity , and 20 % ( 8 of 40 ) function in axonogenesis ( Table 1 ) . Of the 40 proteins , 7 are involved in neurotransmitter release , 2 are neurotransmitter receptors , 7 are cell - cell adhesion proteins , 11 regulate localization of receptors and other membrane proteins , and 6 are signal transducers ( Table 1 ) . Moreover , 35 of the 40 proteins have known protein - protein interactions , and 74 % of these 35 proteins ( 26 of 35 ) interact with each other ( Fig . 5 ) . These data identify a multitiered network in which Nova - regulated RNAs encode proteins that interact in the synapse . General functions of tissue - speciﬁc alternative splicing We undertook a more general analysis of functions among genes with tissue - speciﬁc splicing patterns in comparison with the total set of tissue - expressed genes . Functions with most signiﬁcant enrichment ( P o 0 . 001 , FDR o 0 . 03 , two - to threefold enrichment ; Table 2 and Fig . 4 ) among genes differentially spliced between brain and immune tissues were synaptic transmission , cell - cell signaling , neurogenesis , actin - ﬁlament and microtubule - based process , and organelle organi - zation . Those with most signiﬁcant enrichment among genes differ - entially spliced between spleen and thymus were lymphocyte and B - cell differentiation , immune response and chromatin modiﬁcation . We found no signiﬁcant ( more than twofold ) steady - state changes in wild - type versus Nova2 knockout neocortex ( Supplementary Figs . 1 and 2 online ) , including those transcripts whose alternative splicing is regulated by Nova2 . More generally , whereas many genes showed large differences in steady - state levels in brain relative to thymus and spleen ( Supplementary Fig . 2 online ) , there was no correlation between changes in steady - state level and splicing changes in any of the sample comparisons ( R 2 o 0 . 01 ; data not shown ) . These data agree with previous studies showing that alternative splicing acts independently of transcription to deﬁne tissue - speciﬁc expression proﬁles 14 , 15 and show that Nova does not have a general role in regulating gene transcription or RNA turnover . DISCUSSION Here we report the ﬁrst genome - wide analysis to our knowledge of alternative splicing in a mouse model of a human disorder , POMA . We used mice lacking Nova , a neuron - speciﬁc RNA - binding protein identiﬁed as the POMA antigen , to identify and validate a large array of Nova - regulated alternative exons . This analysis identiﬁed Nova as a regulatory protein at the top of a hierarchical network . Nova coregu - lates alternative splicing of RNAs encoding synaptic proteins that interact among themselves ( Fig . 5 ) . POMA is believed to relate to defective neuronal inhibition ; therefore , it is of particular interest that Nova targets relate to inhibitory synaptic function . We identiﬁed nine Nova - regulated exons for transcripts encoding neurotransmitter receptors or proteins that regulate neurotransmitter release , in addition to two such proteins that were previously identi - ﬁed 8 ( Table 1 and Fig . 5 ) . Nova also regulates transcripts encoding adhesion , scaffold and signaling proteins , indicating that Nova may contribute to regulation of functional and structural synaptic changes that underlie synaptic plasticity . Nova regulates transcripts encoding proteins that may be implicated in a previously undiscovered long - term potentiation ( LTP ) of slow inhibitory postsynaptic current ( sIPSC ) that follows the activation of NMDA receptors 25 . These include RNAs encoding NMDAR1 , necessary for LTP of both excitatory postsynaptic current and sIPSC 25 ; GIRK2 potassium chan - nel and GABAB2 receptor 9 , which give rise to sIPSC 25 ; CaMKII g , which transmits signals to potassium channels 26 ; CASK and neuro - chondrin , which inhibit CaMKII 27 , 28 ; and PLC b 4 , which degrades PIP2 , a mediator of receptor - dependent activation of GIRK 29 . Nova2 function is necessary for the induction of LTP of sIPSC in hippo - campal neurons 25 . These data suggest that in intact brain , modulation of Nova activity may modify the ability of synapses to induce or maintain inhibitory plasticity , where Nova contributes to the higher - order regulation called ‘metaplasticity’ 30 . We identiﬁed 12 Nova - regulated exons for transcripts encoding proteins that regulate localization of receptors and other membrane proteins ( Table 1 and Fig . 5 ) 9 . Notably , Nova regulates splicing of all members of the spectrin – ankyrin – protein 4 . 1 – CASK scaffold complex that functions as a linker between membrane proteins and the actin - tropomyosin cytoskeleton , and this complex is implicated in the subcellular organization of the GABAergic synapse 31 . CLIP experi - ments previously showed that Nova binds b - spectrin and protein 4 . 1N RNAs 9 , and we now ﬁnd that Nova regulates splicing of RNAs encoding a - spectrin and three additional members of the protein 4 . 1 family ( Table 1 ) . These observations suggest that Nova - regulated splicing of 4 . 1R and its homologs contributed to the functional diversiﬁcation of this protein family 32 . Furthermore , Nova promotes inclusion of an exon in protein 4 . 1R that encodes part of the Total brain - expressed WT vs .

The numerical data underlying this ﬁgure are shown in Table 2 . The genes with potential synaptic functions ( blue , purple ) represent 24 % of control exons and 88 % of Nova - target genes ( P o 0 . 01 ) . Eight percent of Nova - regulated genes , compared with 68 % of control exons , encode proteins that are not known to act locally at the synapse . NATURE GENETICS VOLUME 37 [ NUMBER 8 [ AUGUST 2005 849 A R T I C L E S © 2005 N a t u r e P ub li s h i ng G r oup h tt p : / / ww w . n a t u r e . c o m / n a t u r e g e n e t i cs spectrin - fodrin - actin interacting domain 33 , and transcripts encoding a - spectrin are in turn subject to Nova - dependent splicing regulation . Another illustration of Nova - regulated targets that are functionally linked to each other is those associated with the neuromuscular junction . Nova upregulates inclusion of exons 32 and 33 in agrin mRNA ( Z + isoforms ) , which are made in neurons and are necessary for agrin to cluster nicotinic acetylcholine receptors ( nAChR ) at the neuromuscular junction and stimulate synapse formation 34 . More - over , RNAs encoding both nAChR subunits a 4 and b 2 were previously identiﬁed multiple times by CLIP tags in exon 5 of both genes 9 , suggesting that Nova may coordinately regulate nAChR function in the neuromuscular junction or the central nervous system . We identiﬁed seven Nova - regulated exons for transcripts encoding adhesion proteins ( Table 1 and Fig . 5 ) . One of these , SynCAM , can stimulate synapse formation when used to transfect non - neuronal cells 35 . Two other proteins , EphA5 and ephrin - A5 , have a key role in excluding limbic thalamic afferents from the sensorimotor cortex by mediating repulsive interactions 36 . Previous studies of EphA7 , another ephrin - A5 receptor , found that two alternative isoforms of EphA7 receptors stimulate cell adhesion versus repulsion 37 . By analogy , Nova regulation of alternative splicing may affect the outcome of ephrin - A5 – EphA5 interaction , which may in turn affect axon guidance and hippocampal LTP 36 . Probe sets for only one previously reported Nova splicing target , Gphn exon 9 , were present on the microarray , and our results here were concordant with our previous analysis 9 ( Table 1 ) . Ninety - nine genes that were tested on the microarray contained Nova CLIP tags , and none other than Gphn showed | D I | values 4 0 . 20 . But 95 of these were CLIP tags in 3 ¢ untranslated regions or long introns ( far from known alternative exons ) ; these Nova CLIP tags may relate to functions other than splicing regulation . Moreover , the methods are fundamentally different , as CLIP yields RNAs directly bound by Nova , whereas the microarray identiﬁes Nova - dependent splicing targets regardless of whether they are directly bound by Nova . Additional biochemical and biostatistical analysis will be required to address this issue . Nonetheless , the two very different techniques yielded function - ally convergent data , as 71 % of the RNAs with multiple CLIP tags encoded synaptic functions . Genome - wide analysis of gene expression has focused on transcrip - tional control , and some transcription factors are believed to regulate clusters of genes encoding similar functions ( modules ) , including genes involved in neuronal function 3 – 6 . Cellular networks may depend on such encapsulation of functions within modules in order to increase the robustness and ﬂexibility of cells 38 . One of the ﬁrst indications that such coordinate regulation may also occur at the RNA level were ﬁndings in fruit ﬂies that sex lethal regulates splicing or translation of several transcripts involved in sex determination ( tra , sxl and msl - 2 ) 39 , 40 and ﬁndings in mammalian cells that the iron - regulatory RNA binding proteins mediate translational regulation of IRE - containing mRNAs ( ferritin , transferring , ferropoetin and others ) 41 . More recently , suggestions of additional regulatory RNA networks have arisen from studies in which in vitro selection or coprecipitation experi - ments were used to identify RNA - protein interactions in yeast 42 , 43 , fruit ﬂies 44 , mammalian tissue - culture cells 45 , 46 and the brain 9 , 47 , 48 . The Nova - regulated network identiﬁed here provides the ﬁrst description to our knowledge of a validated regulatory module operating at the level of information content mediated by RNA exon usage . This network seems to be especially robust , given the large number of validated exons , the coherent functions of the encoded proteins and the interactions among these proteins . Our data shows that the steady - state levels of Nova - regulated RNAs are unchanged in knockout versus wild - type brains , underscoring the nature of regulated alternative exon usage as a means of modulating the quality of synaptic protein interactions . Rather than the quanti - tative nature afforded by control of steady - state transcript or protein expression , the modular control of exon usage stands out as a qualitative means of regulating information content .

We used kurtosis to measure the distribution of predicted splicing changes , leading to the conclusion that Nova regulates a small subset of alternatively spliced exons , consistent with a modular regulatory structure . We also used GoMiner to analyze the functions of Nova targets by considering exons , rather than whole genes , as individual units ( Table 2 ) . Our ASPIRE method differed in several ways from standard microarray analysis . We ﬁltered the data of individual probes using statistical measures of variance before generating probe sets and empirically optimized ﬁltering criteria that gave high prediction validity . We then identiﬁed probe set pairs for reciprocal alternative isoforms bioinformatically and searched for reciprocal signal changes between biological samples ( Fig . 1 ) . We found that quantifying the splicing as change in fraction of alternative exon inclusion ( D I ) gives a higher prediction validity ( a near 100 % validity rate for D I 4 0 . 20 ) than relative change in alternative isoform ratios , although we provide both types of quantiﬁcation for comparison ( Fig . 3e , f ) . Taken together , this tailoring of our analysis to alternative exon usage allowed us to develop a robust means of identifying Nova targets . In summary , we identiﬁed a new gene regulatory module consisting of transcripts coregulated at the level of alternative splicing . Nova - regulated transcripts encode proteins that form an interaction module in the synapse ( Fig . 5 ) . Such splicing regulatory modules may have provided a means for coordinate regulation of neuron - speciﬁc func - tions to evolve in the context of a genome of limited size . METHODS Microarray design . A custom Affymetrix mouse microarray 49 was designed to comprehensively monitor all alternative splicing events predicted on the basis of alignment of mouse cDNA sequences from dbEST ( 2 April 2002 ) , RefSeq ( 2 April 2002 ) and GenBank ( 2 April 2002 ) to the draft assembly of the mouse genome ( 30 November 2001 ; Whitehead ) . We consolidated the cDNA align - ments into a nonredundant set of splice variants using altMerge 50 . We identiﬁed alternatively spliced exons and then tiled a series of probe sets to interrogate those splicing events . The design of the microarray enabled analysis of cassette exons or alternate splice donors or acceptors . For alternative transcripts , we designed perfect match probe sets for sequence regions unique to each transcript to generate unique probe sets . For constitutive regions that monitor steady - state expression of the gene , we designed perfect match probe sets for sequence regions occurring in a maximal number of transcripts from the same gene . Most probe sets consisted of six 25 - mer perfect match probes spanning the exon - exon junction ( 40 , 443 exon junction probe sets in total ) . We tiled the 25 - mer probes with the center probe position ( base 13 ) at positions (cid:1) 3 , (cid:1) 2 , (cid:1) 1 , 1 , 2 and 3 relative to the exon - exon junction . We derived the junction probe sequence from the mouse genomic sequence , 15 bases ﬂanking each side of the intron . The microarray also contained exon body probe sets , derived from the mouse genomic sequence contained in the exon , consisting of ten 25 - mer perfect match probes selected using the Affymetrix probe hybridization model . Target preparation , hybridization , array washing and scanning . We reverse - transcribed 5 m g of total RNA from postnatal day 7 mouse brain or immune tissues using random hexamers . We puriﬁed cDNA , fragmented it to a length of B 50 – 200 nucleotides using deoxyribonuclease I and end - labeled it with a biotin - conjugated nucleotide using terminal transferase . We hybridized the labeled target to the arrays for 16 h at 50 1 C in 7 % dimethylsulfoxide . We washed and stained the probe arrays in an Affymetrix Fluidics Station using standard protocols for eukaryotic targets . We scanned the stained and washed chips on a GeneArray Scanner ( Agilent Technologies ) . Details are given in Supplementary Methods online . ASPIRE . We used different cDNA amounts for each replicate microarray experiment ( ranging from 1 . 9 m g to 4 . 2 m g ) , and so we normalized the background - subtracted signal intensity of individual probes to the total signal intensity , such that the average spot intensity was the same for all experiments . We ﬁltered the resulting data with a number of quality control criteria that required low variability between replicates and mean and median values above deﬁned cutoff values ( Supplementary Methods online ) so that only high - quality probe data were retained . We ﬁltered the data relative to two samples that were compared , rather than the whole set of data , in a way that retained probes that had high signal intensity in one sample , even if the other sample had low intensity . In this way , probes that potentially represent alternative splicing changes were retained . We then normalized the probe intensities of each gene relative to the change in steady - state level of the gene , using the signals of probes recognizing constitutive parts of the transcript . We generated probe set values by calculating the median signal intensity of probes that recognized the same exon - exon junction or the same exon body . We carried out a search algorithm to identify all potential probe set pairs recognizing reciprocal alternative isoforms . On the basis of bioinformatic predictions , we matched each probe set testing an exon junction that skips an alternative exon ( Fig . 1a ) to a probe set testing either the alternative exon body or one of the exon junctions contacting the alternative exon ( Fig . 1b ) . To reﬁne the alternative exon predictions , we used pairwise comparative analysis of the raw data from all our samples ( Nova knockout and wild - type neocortex , cerebellum , midbrain , spinal cord , thymus and spleen ) to ﬁnd probe set pairs that detected a change in at least one sample . We identiﬁed 4 , 776 probe set pairs , belonging to 3 , 008 genes , in which the two probe sets recognizing exon - including and exon - skipping isoforms showed greater than 1 . 4 - fold reciprocal change of the normalized signals between any two samples . Therefore , these 4 , 776 exons were deﬁned by both bioinformatic prediction and preliminary comparative analysis of the data . We quantiﬁed the change in fraction of exon inclusion ( D I ) of these 4 , 776 exons by comparing two samples at a time . We used two algorithms ; the one that provided greater stringency was D I ¼ ( 1 (cid:1) Rin ) * ( 1 (cid:1) Rex ) / ( Rex (cid:1) Rin ) , where Rin is the ratio of exon - including probe set signal and Rex is the ratio of exon - excluding probe set signal between the two compared samples . Details are given in Supplementary Methods online . Experimental validation of splicing changes . We determined ratios of exon - including isoforms to exon - excluding isoforms by RT - PCR as described previously 8 and , where indicated , by quantitative real - time PCR . Details are given in Supplementary Methods online , and primer sequences are given in Supplementary Table 1 online . Functional analysis by GoMiner . The genes we analyzed differed in the number of tested alternative exons ( from one to nine exons per gene ) . GoMiner 23 and High - Throughput GoMiner 24 traditionally dereplicate total and changed gene input ﬁles so that only one instance of a gene name is processed . When multiple alternatively spliced forms are to be analyzed , however , dereplication would result in a loss of information relevant to alternative splicing . Consequently , we used a new version of High - Throughput GoMiner to retain full information about the alternative splice variants by replicating the input of each gene into GoMiner by the number of alternative exons per gene in total and changed gene input ﬁles . We calculated the signiﬁcance of enrichment in experimental relative to control set ( control set being the total set of exons from genes that are expressed in both of the compared samples ) as one - sided Fisher exact P values and as FDRs . We obtained FDR values using High - Throughput GoMiner by resampling the control set of exons on the microarray 1 , 000 times ( the total brain - expressed set in case of Nova ) and comparing the distribution of P values in all the categories for the real data and the resampled data . We computed the corrected P values as ( randoms mean ) / ( number of categories ) , which is an approximation of the fraction of categories that , by random chance , would have had a P value that was as low as that observed for the real data . Details of High - Throughput GoMiner and the implementation of exon - replicated gene input are available 24 . URL . Our project website is http : / / splicing . rockefeller . edu / .
