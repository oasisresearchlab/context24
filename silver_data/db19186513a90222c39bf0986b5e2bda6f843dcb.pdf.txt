Hamilton 1 , Oliver Garretson 2 , and Andruid Kerne 1 Interface Ecology Lab Dept . of Computer Science and Engineering 1 | Dept . of Sociology 2 Texas A & M University , College Station , Texas USA { bill , andruid } @ ecologylab . net , olivergarretson @ tamu . edu ABSTRACT Previously , video streaming sites were at the fringes of online social media . In the past two years , live streams of video games , on sites such as Twitch . tv , have become very popular . Live streams serve as meeting grounds for player communities . The Twitch streaming medium combines broadcast video with open IRC chat channels . In conjunction with gameplay , viewer participation and community building gain emphasis . Twitch streams range in size and nature , from intimate communities with ﬁfty viewers , to massive broadcasts with tens of thou - sands . In this paper , we present an ethnographic investigation of the live streaming of video games on Twitch . We ﬁnd that Twitch streams act as virtual third places , in which informal communities emerge , socialize , and participate . Over time , stream communities form around shared identities drawn from streams’ contents and participants’ shared experiences . We describe processes through which stream communities form , the motivations of members , and emergent issues in the medium . Finally , we draw from our ﬁndings to derive implications for design of live mixed - media environments to support participatory online communities .

Live - streaming combines high - ﬁdelity computer graphics and video with low - ﬁdelity text - based communica - tion channels to create a unique social medium . Live streaming previously was at the fringes of social media , with a small pop - ulation producing and consuming content .

Twitch streams enable streamers to broadcast high - ﬁdelity video of gameplay and real - life . Participants simultaneously communi - cate through streamed media and an associated chat channel ( right ) . streams of people playing games began growing in popularity . Four years later , the video game live streaming scene has ex - ploded . Twitch . tv , or just Twitch , a website solely supporting video game streaming , has over 34 million unique monthly viewers and tens of thousands of streamers . We present an ethnographic investigation of the emergence of communities amidst live streaming on Twitch . Live streaming , in its current form , enables public broadcast of live audio and video streams alongside a shared chat channel ( Figure 1 ) . In video game live streaming on Twitch , streamers , those who broadcast streams , share live video content of their gameplay composited with a video feed of themselves in real life . Viewers of the stream communicate with the streamer and other viewers through chat . Meanwhile , streamers simul - taneously engage in game play and communicate via audio and video . Participation in streams is open . All that is required to chat is a free Twitch account . We found that people engage in live streaming for two rea - sons : they are drawn to the unique content of a particular stream , and they like being interacted with and participating in that stream’s community . Many Twitch streams are what we consider to be participatory communities , characterized by openness as well as the means for and encouragement of members to engage in shared activities . The primary activity stream participants engage in is sociability , deﬁned by George Simmel as a playful experience of social association character - ized by the “sheer pleasure of being together” [ 23 ] . Sociability in streams takes the form of humorous banter and light - hearted conversation , alongside play . Core community members en - gage in key activities : building community by engaging other participants , promoting participation , and moderating chat . Ray Oldenburg introduces the concept of third places , infor - mal public spaces where people engage in sociability to form and maintain communities [ 19 ] . We posit that streams function as virtual or online third places . We draw from the concept of third places to discuss the genesis and evolution of stream com - munities . Stream communities form around a shared identity drawn from the stream’s content and the shared experiences of its participants . To analyze stream community identity , we draw from McMillan and Chavis’ sense of community [ 18 ] . We ﬁnd that dual emphasis on streamed content and accessible participation results from a medium that mixes high - ﬁdelity broadcast with open low - ﬁdelity chat . Beyond ﬁdelity , these various media afford different levels of participation . We use McLuhan’s concepts of “hot” ( high - ﬁdelity / low - participation ) and “cool” ( low - ﬁdelity / high - participation ) media to analyze how components of live streaming contribute to its overall function as a social medium . By combining hot and cool me - dia , streams enable the sharing of rich ephemeral experiences in tandem with open participation through informal social interaction , the ingredients for a third place . As the popularity of live streaming has increased in recent years , many streams have become very large , some regularly in excess of 5 , 000 live participants . However , as streams scale up , information overload renders chat unreadable , and moderation becomes overwhelming . Some large streams continue to grow . However , participants become frustrated with the difﬁculty of interacting in these streams . We found that for this reason , many choose to participate in smaller streams , which they experience as affording more meaningful interaction . We begin with a socio - technical description of Twitch streams . Next , we present the methodology of our ethnography . We de - velop sensitizing concepts from relevant work in sociology and media theory . We discuss ﬁndings concerning the motivations of stream participants , the formation of stream communities , forms of participation through streaming media , and emer - gent issues concerning participation . We discuss our ﬁndings , and relate prior work . We draw from our ﬁndings to derive implications for design . We articulate the role of mixed live cool and hot media in supporting participatory communities . We develop solutions for scaling participatory communities amid large online audiences . We conclude by considering the potential broader impact of live streaming on other contexts . WHAT IS A TWITCH STREAM ? Twitch streams combine live audio / video media and text - based chat channels . Streams belong to streamers , Twitch users who upload streaming media to be broadcast . Other Twitch users , known as viewers , can then watch the streamed content . Video content on Twitch is primarily of streamers playing various digital games , either by themselves or with friends . Streamers often embed in person webcam video of themselves and others they are playing with on top of their streamed game content to facilitate richer engagement ( Figure 1 ) . Streamed content is not always gameplay , many streamers spend signiﬁcant time interacting with their viewers out of game . Every Twitch stream has an associated Internet Relay Chat ( IRC ) channel . Stream pages have an embedded IRC client adjacent to the streaming video ( see Figures 1 & 2 ) . Within a stream , interaction between participants is typically as follows : the streamer talks through the stream’s broadcast audio , and the viewers then send messages to the streamer and each other in the chat . The streamer will typically try to read the chat and respond to viewers as they play . We describe several types of viewers to convey the topology of a typical stream community . Every stream has followers . By following the stream , these viewers choose to receive email notiﬁcations when the stream goes live . Some viewers become moderators ( “mods” ) , are given the privileges to perform ad - ministrative duties within the stream . Moderators are given a special icon in the chat client to denote their status . They have the power to permanently ban or temporarily timeout view - ers . Normally moderators exercise these powers to prevent people from posting abusive messages or links to inappro - priate websites . Streamers are moderators and can promote stream viewers to be moderators . As we will see , moderators often perform a variety of other tasks to support the stream community . Twitch invites some streamers who bring in a certain thresh - old of views to participate in their “partnership” program . Streamers who enter into this agreement are known as part - ners . Twitch partners earn a share of the ad revenue generated from their streams and can choose when and how ads appear on their stream . The revenue that streamers may earn from ad impressions varies between 2 and 5 USD per 1000 im - pressions . Along with the money from ads , Twitch partners can offer “subscriptions” to their viewers . Subscribers , view - ers who purchase stream subscriptions , pay a monthly fee to Twitch , half of which goes to the streamer . Subscribers do not have to watch stream ads . They may also use the stream’s spe - cial emoticons and are denoted by a icon in chat ( see Figure 2 ) . Streamers often offer additional incentives for subscribers in the form of more opportunities to interact with them on stream . With all of these potential revenue sources , more streamers are going full - time , quitting their jobs , and attempting to live the dream of being payed to play video games . Figure 2 . Every Twitch stream has an embedded chat channel . Twitch uses a custom IRC client with special features for showing stream spe - ciﬁc emoticons and denoting stream subscribers and moderators .

This study began informally , in early 2010 , when we started to become active participants in different streams on JustinTV , Twitch’s predecessor . Over nearly four years , we became immersed in the Twitch community , as a whole , and a plethora of particular stream communities . As a result , we have developed deep ﬁrsthand knowledge of stream viewer experience , streaming practice , and communities . In addition to our long term involvement , we interviewed 11 Twitch streamers and 4 viewers over the past year . Initially , we speciﬁcally chose to interview streamers , because of the core role they play in streaming communities . Most streamers spend hours everyday not only streaming , but trying to build a stronger understanding of streaming phenomena and interacting with other stream communities . This makes stream - ers a dense source of inside knowledge and understanding . We later decided to interview 4 viewers who are core members of their respective stream communities : interviewing them helped us better understand individual viewer experiences . In order to build rapport with the interviewed streamers and viewers , we started to participate in their streams’ chats during the weeks prior to recruiting for interviews . By doing this , the researchers became part of each streamer’s regular view - ership . With some of the streamers interviewed , we already had prior rapport , based on our long term involvement in par - ticular streams . This process also helped familiarize us with each stream’s community and enabled us to ask participants focused questions during interviews . Once a level of rapport was reached , we went on to recruit streamers via the private messaging system of Twitch . Table 2 . Viewers interviewed .

Time spent as viewers enabled us to ascertain each stream’s atmo - sphere , chat moderation policy , and community . We sought to interview a gamut of streamers from different game com - munities , attitudes , and stream sizes . Table 1 summarizes the streamers that we recruited for interviewing . We will refer to the interviewed streamers by the identiﬁers given in Table 1 . In selecting viewers , we similarly focused on recruiting view - ers who were active stream participants . We speciﬁcally tried to recruit a number of stream moderators . By recruiting these viewers we were able to interview those who had a strong understanding of their respective communities . Table 2 sum - marizes the viewers we interviewed . Participants were interviewed via audio / video chat , with the exception of S1 and S10 , who we interviewed in person . The interviews , which typically lasted between 1 to 2 hours , were recorded , and later transcribed . We used a semi - structured in - terview format , focusing on each streamer’s experiences , their stream’s community , and their goals . Many of the questions focused on evoking important moments and experiences from the streamer’s tenure . After completing the interviews , we continued efforts to be active participants in their streams . We proceeded to conduct a grounded theory analysis by ﬁrst transcribing the recorded interviews . Transcripts were then unitized , breaking them up into units of meaning . We then used the constant comparative method to code the unitized interview transcripts into emergent themes and categories [ 8 , 15 ] . All codes emerged through the coding process , and were iteratively derived to describe observed phenomena . Other data collected from researcher ﬁeld notes and reﬂexive journals were also used in the coding process . In total , approximately 1 , 700 data units were coded in the analysis . SENSITIZING CONCEPTS We develop sensitizing concepts from prior work to frame our investigation of live streaming communities and media . We consider Oldenburg’s concept of third places and how they serve as important environments for the formation and maintenance of communities [ 19 ] . We discuss McMillan and Chavis’s components of community and apply them in con - junction with data to show how communities form around Twitch streams [ 18 ] . Finally , we connect McLuhan’s concepts of “hot” and “cool” media to analyze the participatory nature of live streaming’s constituent media components [ 17 ] . Third Places Oldenburg establishes the concept of third places as “public places that host the regular , voluntary , informal , and happily anticipated gatherings of individuals beyond the realms of home and work” [ 19 ] . Third places serve as alternative loca - tions , for people to come together , form , and maintain commu - nities through informal public social interactions . Oldenburg identiﬁes typical third places , such as cafes , coffee shops , and bars . Later , Rheingold connected a study of virtual commu - nities with Oldenburg’s third places [ 22 ] . Since then , it has been used to describe the roles of various media in the for - mation of online communities . These include Bruckman and Resnick’s work on MUDs [ 4 ] and Ducheneaut et . al’s study of massively multiplayer online games [ 6 ] . We introduce the some of the characteristics of third places , and use them to show how streams function as such . Conversation is the main activity inside a third place . Par - ticipants experience this talk as good , lively , humorous , and colorful . In this way , the third place fosters sociability . Old - enburg discusses how talk in third places is often playful and is situated around games such as gin rummy or dominoes . Conversation becomes continuously driven by play , as partici - pants talk about the players’ , “slyness , slowness , quickness , meanness , [ and ] allusions to long - remembered incidents in club history . ” Indeed , the primary form of participation that occurs in streams is playful discussion in the chat . Discussion is driven by the events occurring in the game being streamed . Third places have regulars , those who frequent the place to enjoy the company of other regulars and newcomers . These people strongly deﬁne the place . As Oldenburg explains , “It is the regulars whose mood and manner provide the infectious and contagious style of interaction and whose acceptance of new faces is crucial . ” Every regular was once a newcomer There are no strict requirements on who can participate . All that is required is a shared understanding that a newcomer is of a “decent sort” , capable of carrying on a civil and playful discussion , and that they will likely be seen again . Thus , to become a regular , “One simply keeps reappearing and tries not to be obnoxious” [ 19 ] . As we will show , this process of inducting newcomers and the emergence of regulars plays a key role in the formation and growth of stream communities . Sense of Community McMillan and Chavis deﬁne sense of community through four components : membership , inﬂuence , fulﬁllment of needs , and emotional connection [ 18 ] . We use these as a basis for characterizing stream participants’ conceptions of community . The status of membership is developed through personal in - vestment in the community , yielding feelings of the right to belong and community identity [ 18 ] . Membership serves as the primary boundary determining who is in and outside of the community . The primary form this investment takes in stream communities is through members’ spending their time and personal energy . Participants often also invest personal skills and money into a stream community . Inﬂuence revolves around two oppositional ideas . Participants are attracted to groups whose activities they can impact [ 18 ] . In the case of stream communities , viewers are attracted to streams where they are recognized by the streamer and other participants , and can participate in stream activities , such as gameplay . Communities also evoke a sense of conformity , members naturally adopt shared qualities inherent to the group . In practice , a stream community tends to exhibit a shared social atmosphere instituted by the streamer and regulars . A core part of members’ sense of community is that communal beneﬁts fulﬁll their needs in some way . This fulﬁllment takes several forms including emotional rewards such as sociability , the status of membership , and the success of the community . These rewards and their importance to participants is evident in stream communities . Another common reward is the gain - ing of knowledge and skills available from other community members . In stream communities , this often takes the form of game skill and knowledge , which may be uniquely available from the streamer or their viewers . Community members develop an emotional connection through shared history and an identiﬁcation with other mem - bers . This shared connection is developed primarily through continued participation : “The more people interact , the more likely they are to become close” [ 18 ] . The more positive the experience that members have in the context of the community , the greater their emotional connection to that group . In third places , such as streams , regulars take it upon themselves to en - gender positive experiences making the community attractive to newcomers , building the community through encouraging participation and open acceptance of new members . Hot & Cool Media McLuhan used ﬁdelity and participation as correlated features for the analysis of forms of media [ 17 ] . Telephone , he said , is a cool medium of low ﬁdelity and high participation , because so little is given and so much must be ﬁlled in by the listener . A photograph and a ﬁlm are high deﬁnition ( hot ) , while a comic is low and cool . Cool media afford participation . Hot media afford spectating . Live streaming is a hybrid form , conjoining game graphics ( high ﬁdelity ) , live webcam video ( medium ﬁdelity ) , and chat ( low ﬁdelity ) . We found that streaming’s hybrid assemblage of synchronized low to high ﬁdelity media components en - gages people in Twitch . Not surprisingly , participation is most directly afforded by the low ﬁdelity medium of IRC , making streams open and accessible , empowering newcomers . It is through this medium that core community interaction occurs through congenial and playful conversation . At the same time , hot live video , based on relatively common com - puter graphics and networking , powerfully facilitates sharing rich experiences of play . It gives participants opportunities to engage more deeply . These shared ephemeral experiences afforded by high - ﬁdelity media are the foundation of a stream community’s shared history and emotional connection . FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION In the following sections , we present ﬁndings on streaming practices and communities . We discuss these ﬁndings in light of the sensitizing concepts to clarify the nature of streams as third places and the senses of community shared by their participants . We start by discussing factors that draw viewers to particular streams and how these factors inﬂuence stream community identity . We follow this with a discussion of the importance of viewer participation and inﬂuence in streams . We then proceed to a discussion of community regulars , ad - dressing their roles in keeping stream communities inviting and promoting stream participation . Finally , we discuss how the streaming medium affords the formation of shared com - munity history , and how it starts to break down in terms of supporting participation as audiences grow larger . Identiﬁcation with Content , Streamer , and Community When we asked viewers about how they started watching streams , almost invariably they responded that they wanted to learn something about a particular game . Many had similar experiences to V1’s : I [ had ] just picked up League , and I wanted to improve . Why don’t I just look for a streamer . . . I found a bunch . I click on one , and this is pretty much how I joined . Our own induction into the world of streaming started with wanting to learn to become better StarCraft II players in 2010 [ 25 ] . McMillan and Chavis note the importance of learning from other community members . He observes that the chance to beneﬁt from the unique competencies of others is a strong motivating factor in community . A major theme that emerged through our analysis is that streams develop an atmosphere that reﬂects the streamer’s attitude and values . This projection of the streamer’s personal - ity then inﬂuences those who stay , because their attitudes and values are shared not only by the streamer , but by the commu - nity that emerges . For the viewers we interviewed , a sense of friendliness is an important criterion , because it let them feel comfortable enough to talk and interact with others . Friend - liness came up repeatedly throughout the study as important for a healthy stream community . This sense of friendliness was frequently attributed to a streamer’s congenial attitude and behavior . Interviewees identiﬁed other streamers who exhibit silliness or open anger on their streams . They noted that these qualities tend to draw a similar crowd . Even in these cases , the streamer still generally exhibits a congenial attitude toward their viewers . From a third places perspective , congeniality helps maintain a sense of openness and acceptance . Several streamers indicated that they notice the reﬂection of their personality having a beneﬁcial impact on their stream’s community . S6 pointed out that this has a quality control effect on the stream ; that if the streamer is calm , collected , and respectful , then the stream will attract viewers who are the same . S11 reported that she felt this effect helps her focus her stream and maintain meaningful interactions with her viewers . Female streamers are sometimes targets of sexist behavior . S11 developed strategies for dealing with this in the live streaming medium : “It really depends on the way you carry yourself . . . because the attention isn’t on me being a girl , its on the game . . . if you go to any stream , what they [ the streamer ] is focused on is what chat will be focused on . ” The Importance of Interaction and Inﬂuence McMillan and Chavis describe how communities serve to fulﬁll their members’ emotional needs [ 18 ] . In the case of stream communities , many people watch streams for social interaction with other human beings with whom they identify . In the case of V1 , participating in S11’s stream is one of her primary means of socializing . She explains : I’m studying overseas . I ﬁnd that there is no one that I can really identify with , and then I go online and there are all of these fucking awesome people , and they all like the same games . So it just comes natural to you . Similarly , V4 is a stay - at - home mom . Participating in S8’s stream gives her a chance to interact with others during the day while she is at home with her kids . Conversely , many streamers stream because they want to build a community . They want to have a place where they can make friends and hang out . S1 , S2 , S3 , S6 , S7 , S9 , and S11 indicated that an important part of why they stream is because of the associated community and their chance to interact with members . Many see their regular viewers as friends . Their stream is their primary way to bring those friends together and sociably interact with them . McMillan and Chavis also note that people are drawn to com - munities in which they can have inﬂuence and impact [ 18 ] . We observe this sense of attraction in stream communities . View - ers desire to be recognized and interacted with . While all the viewers we interviewed are all very involved in their respective stream communities , it is clear that for less involved viewers , even minimal personal interaction can be rewarding . This is generally understood by streamers . Many make special efforts to recognize every person at least once in their streams . V3 , a long time viewer and moderator in many different streams explained that , “There are a lot of people in here that are self conscious , have other certain problems , and just saying hello and being nice to them , you know interacting with them , can really make their day . ” Streamers also make concerted efforts to give participants chances to have inﬂuence on the stream in ways beyond that possible in chat . A common practice is for streamers to play games with their viewers to give them some time in the spot - light and a chance to stand out . S9 explained , “I think that is a big draw for a lot of people that come to my stream . They want to get a chance to play with the people that they watch . ” Streamers also create other participatory activities besides di - rect play for their viewers . For example , we participated in one of S7’s streaming sessions , in which he was playing Family Feud , using answers suggested by his viewers . Polls are frequently conducted on many streams . The streamer will either do a rough poll based on the chat , or create a poll on a site such as strawpoll . me . Polls are often used to decide what the streamer will do at critical points in a game . Polls are also used to make important community decisions . We participated in a poll to determine who should be made a moderator in S7’s stream . V1 was similarly made a moderator in S11’s stream . There are many other ways that viewers can participate in streams . One particularly afforded by the streaming medium is the sharing and adoption of fan art created by a stream’s viewers . Streamers can easily overlay these digital images over and around the game graphics and webcam video on their stream . For example , S9 has collected approximately 90 differ - ent viewer created artworks . He displays a slideshow of all of these periodically during game load screens . In another stream that focuses on tabletop role - playing games , the streamers accept viewer art of their encounters and display it on their stream during their play sessions . This practice is particularly interesting because it provides a direct way for viewers to have a lasting impact on the stream and make it their own . Becoming a Regular Oldenburg describes how at the core of every third place are regulars , those people who most frequently visit the place [ 19 ] . McMillan and Chavis describes how the more people interact the more they will develop a shared history and are more likely they are to become close [ 18 ] . It is the regulars who have invested the most of themselves into the community and who most strongly deﬁne its qualities through their participation . By regularly showing up , participants start to build a level of trust and recognition among other regulars , which is hard to develop any other way . This process of becoming a regular is strongly at play in stream communities . Those viewers who regularly show up , eventu - ally become recognized community members . V1 described this process as it pertained to her becoming a mod and an important part of S11’s stream : Sometimes people seem to place more eminence [ sic ] on you , because you are around a lot of the time , and to them you are a crucial element to the entire element of the channel . . . according to [ anon ] , I have been a pretty crucial part in helping the community grow . Cause when somebody sees some of their faces all of the time , I mean their names , it kind of helps to give them that sense of familiarity . And that is why we keep coming back . When asked , streamers often identiﬁed regulars as their friends , those with whom they became closest . They felt like these were people that they identiﬁed with and could count on to continue as positive parts of their stream’s community . When we asked V3 about S10’s stream community , which became much smaller during the 9 months between when we inter - viewed S10 and V3 , he indicated that the community was now mostly comprised of regulars . He reported that the community is now , “Stronger with the amount of people that are there because of how well we know each other now . . . everybody kinda feels like they are part of it . That is why we show up every day . ” In stream communities , regular participation is the primary path to membership , through the development of familiarity , recognition , and history with other members . Regulars Encouraging Participation and Sociability During our interviews , we inquired about moderators , because they clearly play an important role in stream communities . What we learned is that most moderators are given the status largely to demarcate them as regulars . This makes them easy to recognize , because they are given a special badge next to their handle in chat . What also became clear is that the role of moderators is not only to keep the discussion in line , but to engage viewers and promote participation and sociability . This most often involves greeting viewers , answering ques - tions , and trying to connect personally with newcomers . Greet - ing individual viewers is an activity that can be seen on most streams of a reasonably small size . As discussed before , be - ing greeted is greatly appreciated by many viewers . It is an important part of some stream communities . Question asking and answering occurs constantly on most streams . For V2 , having questions answered , his own and other viewers’ , by the streamer is his favorite part of participating in S5’s stream . V1 also indicated that as a moderator , she felt like it was her responsibility to personally connect with viewers . Streamers indicated that the viewers they noticed frequently taking it upon themselves to ﬁll these roles were those that they felt could be trusted to be moderators . Through these roles of community building and promotion of interaction , viewers become core members . Viewers expect many of these roles to be performed by the streamer . Indeed , many of the streamers we interviewed are happy to perform them . However , they have to split their focus between the game they are playing and engaging with their viewers , which becomes difﬁcult in some games , particularly with large numbers of viewers . Thus , having moderators and other regulars ﬁll these roles helps a stream operate smoothly , and keeps viewers engaged . According to Oldenburg , a third place’s regulars are those “whose mood and manner provide the infectious and conta - gious style of interaction and whose acceptance of new faces is crucial . ” Regulars are the lifeblood of stream communities . They take it upon themselves to welcome viewers , whether newcomers or old regulars . Shared History through Hot & Cool Media Stream communities grow and build a shared sense of history through the streaming medium . Both Oldenburg and McMil - lan note the importance of shared history in the formation of communities [ 18 , 19 ] . It is a key part of the emotional connection that community members share . Signiﬁcant shared experiences in stream communities happen around ephemeral in - game events . We asked participants about favorite moments in the streams they participate in . Many indicated that these moments occur when something unusual happens in the game being played . S5 : If there is a very exciting moment and I capture some exciting thing that people go crazy about in chat , that is the most rewarding thing . We note that there are two parts to this kind of experience . The ﬁrst is witnessing something surprising , the likes of which may never happen again . Seeing something like this live is a compelling feeling , the same kind of feeling that one might experience at a live concert or sporting event . Video games are an interesting context for live streams , because unique Figure 3 . Twitch viewers expect streamers to use webcams , so they can share their emotional reactions . ephemeral events happen relatively frequently , and can be speciﬁcally created by a streamer . However , there is a second part to these experiences , in which the “chat goes crazy . ” It rapidly ﬁlls up with messages like “LOLOLOL” or other humorous phrases and emoticons spe - ciﬁc to the game or the stream . For instance , “ RAISE UR DONGERS ” is a popular phrase on the streamer Imaqtpie’s stream . This feedback lets everyone share in the emotional high of the moment . It reminds everyone that they are part of a unique group of people that saw something special as it happened . Streamers also reported that viewers expected them to have webcams , so that they could share their emotional reactions to these events through facial expressions ( Figure 3 ) . The combination of cool with hot media affords the develop - ment of shared histories through intense game experiences , resulting in the formation of a stream community’s emotional connection . Hot live video and game graphics enable audi - ences to observe unique , rich experiences . Cooler webcam video and coolest text chat enable them to contribute to and experience these things together , seeing each other’s reactions . Big Streams and the Breakdown of Participation We consider streams that draw more than 1 , 000 viewers to be massive . Usually , there are 20 to 60 massive streams live on Twitch . At the time of writing , we sampled a Twitch audience of approximately 440 , 000 viewers . Roughly , 20 % were in streams of less than 1 , 000 viewers , and 50 % were in streams with more than 5 , 000 . The viewers we interviewed watch both massive and smaller streams . In smaller streams , the focus is more on participation , on interacting with other viewers and building community . When watching massive streams , they are there for the unique content available from that streamer . V3 explained this : [ In ] the big streams they are there for the person [ the streamer ] to be honest . They are not there to talk to a ton of people . They are there for the actual entertainment . As a stream grows , the chat becomes a source of breakdowns . It transforms from a meaningful medium of discussion into an illegible waterfall of text , scrolling up the page so quickly that it cannot be read . Participants can no longer follow the conversation . At best , they can try to pull out a few comments every so often . When this happens , the one - on - one interaction between stream participants stops . We note that in streams that are this large , the quality of the chat stream changes to something like the roar of a crowd in a stadium . It is possible to sense an overall feeling of the audience from a few recognized messages and ﬂuctuations in the rate at which they appear . Posting in a chat stream like this is still a form of participation . However , the impact of any one individual is miniscule . Despite not being able to converse meaningfully in these streams , watching these steams is still compelling to some . V2 explained : Even if the chat is . . . undesirable on the bigger streams , it’s still nice to see how sometimes as much as 50k + people go to one place to see one person play . From a third places perspective , anything that interrupts the ﬂow of conversation is ruinous . Oldenburg cites the use of overly loud music , or the din generated by too many visitors , as ruining the potential of a third place : because it renders healthy conversation impossible [ 19 ] . In the same way , overly crowded chat rooms on Twitch streams destroy the potential for communities to form through participation . When asked how many viewers they could interact with ef - fectively , streamers frequently reported 100 - 150 ; some felt they could support up to 500 . Past this threshold , they felt per - sonal interaction between them and the viewers breaks down . For various reasons , some streamers want massive streams . Streamers who are full - time rely solely on donations and ad impression revenue for their ﬁnancial income . This presents a problem , as S10 , a full - time streamer reported : Honestly , if I could have [ only ] 150 people in my stream at all times , I would love that . But it’s impossible to al - ways have 150 viewers , at least in my position . . . because I won’t make any money at all . There are other factors at play . Many streamers seek the fame and notoriety of a large audience . To others , success does not mean having a massive stream . Some focus on building their stream’s community for the pleasure of being with those people . S3 and S7 reported that they speciﬁcally enjoy their communities , because they interact with their viewers mean - ingfully . They have been maintaining these communities for years . S3 explained : When you get a lot of people in the channel , it will no longer be my channel ; it will be a ﬂood of chat . I will no longer be able to keep up and it won’t be me , because I won’t be able to do what I normally do , and that is give everyone the time to talk . I actually feel guilty when I can’t read everyone’s chat . Subscribers Only : Sacriﬁcing Openness for Quality An approach that some large streams have adopted is the use of chat mode called subscriber - only . In this mode , only people who pay a 5 USD monthly subscription fee to the stream can type in chat . The conversation is still public . Everyone can still read the chat , but only subscribers can contribute . A motivation for subscriber - only mode is to cut down on the inherent noise of having thousands of people together in a single chat room . V3 , who is a subscriber to several channels that use this interaction mode , explained : If there are a ton of viewers in there , that’s why a lot of these sub only chats are a lot nicer . Obviously if you don’t have a sub you can’t talk , but if you do it’s a lot nicer . If you want to be a part of that community and you have enough money to do so then you’ll be able to do that and it’s no big deal . Obviously , it kind of stinks for other people . We found this point of view intriguing because it reveals the underlying user need for meaningful interaction . Prior to inter - viewing V3 , our impression of subscriber - only mode was that it was used as a reward for subscribers at the expense of those who cannot afford the subscription . However , it became clear that , while this may be a factor , some stream communities are searching for ways to preserve their personal interactions despite the ever - growing sizes of stream audiences . While the use of subscriber - only mode is a kind of kludge to maintain some of the coolness of the chat medium , it funda - mentally undermines accessible participation in stream com - munities . Many streamers who use subscriber - only mode recognize this dilemma and turn it off occasionally or on a speciﬁc day of the week . Inevitably , after the mode is turned off , you will see the chat explode with messages like “FREE - DOM ! ” and “RELEASE THE KRAKEN ! ” . Non - subscribers are elated that they can participate in an open chat . RELATED WORK We discuss two areas of online communities research partic - ularly relevant to our own . First , we address the IRC com - munication modality and issues of information overload in chat based communities . Second , we review relevant work in online game communities . We compare and contrast them with Twitch streams . Finally , we consider eSports phenomena and how they have coevolved with live streaming . IRC Communities and Information Overload IRC emerged in the late 1980’s as a popular form of computer - mediated communication . It remains widely used today . Reid recognized IRC early on as a compelling communication modality that led to the emergence of intimate real - time online communities [ 21 ] . IRC’s text chat is essentially a building block of the live streaming medium . Participants similarly engage in stream chats , and suffer similar difﬁculties . How - ever , without game graphics and webcam video , IRC does not afford the same experiences as a live stream . As discussed above , live audio and video help stream communities develop emotional connection by sharing rich experiences of play . Jones et al . identify information overload as a major problem of IRC [ 10 ] . They apply an information - processing constraints model [ 12 ] to investigate how IRC , by removing normal limits on communication , puts increased demand on human information - processing capabilities . As the number of posts increases , participants’ capacities to digest and understand dialogue becomes overloaded . Thus , the number of messages per participant asymptotically approaches 0 as the number of participants increases . The main observable outcome is an inherent limit on the size of IRC channels . Speciﬁcally , they ﬁnd that IRC can support a maximum of 300 concurrent users , with no more than 40 active posters [ 10 ] . We see a similar maximum , of 500 participants , in live streams . How are we to interpret then the emergence of streams with as many as 10 to 50 times this many viewers ? While it is apparent that these streams often become more spectacle than conver - sation , we have seen that the shared experiences afforded by hot video are sufﬁcient to loosely bind the stream audience together beyond the breakdown of meaningful conversation . Participation in Online Game Communities A large body of work explores social interaction and commu - nity formation in multi - player online games [ 1 , 20 , 7 , 6 , 16 ] . We recognize a connection between communities emerging on Twitch , and those found in online games . In many cases , the lines between these communities blur . For instance , in the early months of S10’s stream , he created an approximately 500 member Star Wars : The Old Republic guild , primarily comprised of his stream’s viewers . However , there are subtle differences between contexts . In a live stream , participants do share play experiences . However , most viewers are focused on the streamer’s experience . They lack agency in the game world . Consistent with Oldenburg’s discussion of a magic circle effect in third places [ 19 ] , streams afford their own special space somewhere outside that of the game’s , and still separate from the rest of the world . The integration of webcam video helps participants connect on a more personal level . Stream participants are not acting through in - game characters . They are acting as themselves . Another difference is accessibility . Soukup identiﬁes accessi - bility as a sticking point when it comes to treating computer - mediated communications ( CMCs ) as third places [ 24 ] . He argues while many CMCs are open , many are context speciﬁc and require speciﬁc knowledge and skills to participate . This issue comes up if we consider in - game environments as third places , as Ducheneaut et al . do [ 6 ] . Participation in games often requires considerable skill and engagement . In contrast , a viewer can log onto a stream with little to no understanding of the game being played , making it an accepting place for n00bs as well as veteran gamers . That viewer can then choose the level to which he or she participates , whether passively watching for days , or actively chatting daily for months . A stream viewer can come and go as s / he pleases ; whereas , an involved player may be obliged to participate for the duration of a gaming session or raid . This may last 30 minutes to several hours . A gamut of levels is important , because it allows participants to seamlessly interweave their involvement with the third place in - between the more pressing demands of their home and work life [ 19 ] . Ducheneaut et al . observe that much interaction in Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games addresses develop - ment of reputation and performing in front of others [ 7 ] . They predicted that “providing more ways for players to play not only for themselves , but ‘in front’ of others , would build on this trend . ” Live streaming instantiates this model of perfor - mative play , while supporting the formation of communities . eSports and Live Streaming The emergence of eSports , the high - level play and spectating of competitive digital games , has coevolved with the rise of video game live streaming . The phenomena of eSports spectat - ing was explored by Cheung and Huang [ 5 ] . They found simi - larities in spectating traditional and electronic sports . Specta - cles of high - level play and information asymmetry in eSports games motivate people to watch . We found that while eS - ports spectating is a signiﬁcant live streaming activity , many streams focus not on the highest level of play , but on social engagement and community building . Kow and Young present a case study of media technologies supporting learning within eSports communities [ 14 ] . While they cite the importance of “Internet TV” as a medium , they do not discuss interactive components of live streaming . Kay - toue et al . recently examined Twitch as a platform for live streaming , developing a quantitative analysis of the growth of particular eSports streams [ 13 ] . Our research , in contrast , indicates that the formation of participatory communities is at the core of the live streaming experience . Large streams struggle to maintain meaningful social engagement . IMPLICATIONS FOR DESIGN We present implications for the design of streaming media systems to support the formation of participatory communities . We show how mixing cool and hot media supports environ - ments that foster the emergence of communities and serve as third places . We consider solutions to the breakdown of par - ticipation in large communities due to information overload . Integrate Cool & Hot Media to Form Third Places While live streams are comprised of streaming video and IRC , both fairly commonplace technologies , the result is more than the sum of its parts . Cool text chat affords accessible partic - ipation and a medium through which to converse , the main activity of the third place . Conversely , hot video affords the sharing of rich experiences , driving the conversation and for - mation of shared history . The broadcast video of live streams is relatively cool in comparison to other video forms . We have shown how by mixing these media , streams function as third places for emergent online communities . Holistically , the live streaming medium is relatively cool , affording ample room for participation when scale is accounted for . A key aspect of live streaming’s mixed - media integration is that core participants can dynamically control the layout and mixture of visual media in a stream’s broadcast . This em - powers them to compose the media in situated ways to afford rich engagement through participation and shared experiences . Participants compose the presence , size , and layout of cool media components , such as webcams , chat logs , and viewer art , amidst hot game graphics . This compositing of hot and cool components is essential to the live streaming medium . We prescribe further investigation of how dynamic media compo - sition can support participation in live streaming communities . Preserve Meaningful Interaction through Subdivision As we have seen , the scale of streams sometimes grows very large . Large streams initialy draw viewers in with content that is unique and compelling , independent of how many are viewing . As more people start to watch , a stream stands out more . It draws more new viewers . Further , in many streams there is a sense that the community wants to grow . Streamers , moderators , and regulars interact with newcomers to make the stream inviting . Thus , the stream functions as a third place . However , there are no physical constraints , as in a bar or coffee shop , to keep the number of participants manageable . At a certain point , some streams cross a threshold and go viral . As we have seen , conversation starts to break down as the audience scales . So what is there to do ? We recount a decen - tralizing practice that we noticed within some Twitch streams . Smaller streamers will sometimes stream as they are watching some other major stream . These other streams , are usually huge and have completely unreadable chats . For instance , S11 recently gathered her comparatively small community of 600 to watch and converse about the League of Legends All - Star event , a stream with more than 200 , 000 viewers . We ﬁnd this practice compelling because it enables smaller , already formed intimate communities to participate in large - scale events , while maintaining connection and meaningful interaction . We hypothesize that , by developing mechanisms to subdivide large followings into smaller groups , we can help maintain meaningful participation . We note that Jones and Rafaeli have previously discussed the potential of splitting virtual publics to maintain legible communication [ 11 ] . However , they suggested doing this without regard for prevailing so - cial connections within the group . We argue that , given the importance of shared histories in virtual third places , such as streams , segmentation should not be performed blindly . Randomly grouping people without regard for their interests , existing relationships , and participation history will destroy participants’ senses of shared identity . We propose to account for the vitality of community by build - ing a model representing participants’ interests , relationships , and histories . This model will inform algorithms that dynam - ically subdivide an audience into socially viable subgroups . Given the importance of shared histories , such a system needs to prioritize social continuity , as well as spontaneous encoun - ters . One approach is to keep people in touch with their friends , acquaintances , and core community members , while ﬁltering out other communications . This will enable users to maintain relationships and participate , while keeping communication legible . To inform the design of subdivision experiences , we propose drawing conceptual models from physical experiences of small groups in large crowds such as performances , rituals , academic conferences , and political demonstrations . Given the impact that such subdivision would have on com - munity members’ social interactions and relationships , it is important to make such a system intelligible and accountable [ 3 ] . Make the model and its impact visible to users . We envi - sion such a tool as mixed - initiative , inferring how to automate the complex subdivision process , while employing dialog to resolve key uncertainties with participants [ 9 ] . The system would identify potential social groups and provide mecha - nisms for dynamically forming them . The system would then clearly present information about identiﬁed subgroups to par - ticipants , enabling them to make informed decisions about how and when to sub - divide . Of course , sub - division would not always be needed . It would be used in cases when communication overwhelms a single shared medium . As discussed , having space in which to par - ticipate and inﬂuence a community is important to members . Sub - dividing so that there is a space for everyone to partici - pate , would be a big step in meeting participants’ social needs . We recognize that creating such a system would not be simple . One approach to doing this without denying users’ agency is to enable participants to toggle semi - automatic subdivision off and on . Other problems will lie in how to support core members engagement with the whole audience . In any case , user - centered iterative design will be essential . CONCLUSION Oldenburg discusses the importance of third places in society , due to the social beneﬁts they provide to participants [ 19 ] . The assemblage of hot and cool media enable streams to provide an open place for people to go socialize , play , and participate in something larger than themselves . The openness and participa - tory nature of streaming communities played an important role in our own initial interest . Participating in all of the streams throughout the study was rewarding in that it helped fulﬁll our own need to ﬁnd a place to kick back , have a laugh , and be part of a community . During the study , we were always welcome in the different stream communities that we participated in . We experienced this as inherently gratifying . We note that when we ﬁrst started participating in streams , the largest still possessed only hundreds of viewers . Now that so many streams have grown to massive scales , pressure mounts to ﬁnd ways to maintain streaming communities’ participatory nature . We have proposed that this problem be approached through mixed - initiative subdivision into smaller groups that maintain both the sense of community and level of participa - tion sought by stream community members . The participation and experiences afforded by the cool and hot components of the streaming medium are integral to the nature of stream communities . The emergence of participatory communities on Twitch shows how the integration of cool and hot media can foster third places that broadly impact a gamut of digitally mediated real time experiences of entertainment and education . Cool + hot streaming media methods have the potential to similarly increase the sense of participation in second screen audience interaction experiences , which are being developed for television shows and sports [ 2 ] . Likewise , streaming media can help make MOOC education experiences more organic and participatory , and less factory like . Streaming on Twitch establishes a new paradigm for online communities in a range of emerging contexts . The grow - ing availability of streaming media capabilities will enable broadening impact . At the same time , Twitch has shown us how participation can break down as streams scale . Modeling social user experiences , and using these models to drive mixed - initiative interfaces has the potential to overcome breakdowns and scale participatory communities . REFERENCES 1 .
