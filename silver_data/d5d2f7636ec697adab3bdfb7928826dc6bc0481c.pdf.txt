We examined biochemical and cell biological properties of Cae - norhabditis elegans tropomyosin ( CeTM ) and obtained evidence that CeTM is antagonistic to ADF / coﬁlin - dependent actin ﬁlament dynamics . We puriﬁed CeTM , actin , and UNC - 60B ( a muscle - speciﬁc ADF / coﬁlin isoform ) , all of which are derived from C . elegans , and showed that CeTM and UNC - 60B bound to F - actin in a mutually exclusive manner . CeTM inhibited UNC - 60B – induced actin depoly - merization and enhancement of actin polymerization . Within isolated native thin ﬁlaments , actin and CeTM were detected as major components , whereas UNC - 60B was T present at a trace amount . Puriﬁed UNC - 60B was unable to interact with the native thin ﬁlaments unless CeTM and other associated proteins were removed by high - salt extraction . Puriﬁed CeTM was sufﬁcient to restore the resistance of the salt - extracted ﬁlaments from UNC - 60B . In muscle cells , CeTM and UNC - 60B were localized in different patterns . Suppression of CeTM by RNA interference resulted in disorganized actin ﬁlaments and paralyzed worms in wild - type background . However , in an ADF / coﬁlin mutant background , suppression of CeTM did not worsen actin organization and worm motility . These results suggest that tropomyosin is a physiological inhibitor of ADF / coﬁlin - dependent actin dynamics . Introduction Actin cytoskeleton is dynamic , and there is a constant exchange of actin subunits in the filaments by polymerization and depolymerization . However , within a single cell , different cytoskeletal structures exhibit variable rates of actin filament turnover . In lamellipodia of motile cells , rapid polymerization and depolymerization of actin filaments allow protrusion of the leading edges ( Wang , 1985 ) . In contrast , in stress fibers , actin filaments are less dynamic and the rate of monomer exchange within the filaments is relatively slow ( Glacy , 1983 ; Amato and Taylor , 1986 ; Okabe and Hirokawa , 1989 ) . These differences are regulated by a number of actin - binding proteins that affect assembly and disassembly of actin filaments ( Cooper and Schafer , 2000 ; Pollard et al . , 2000 ) . Actin depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) * / cofilin is one of the key players in enhancing actin filament turnover ( Bamburg , 1999 ; Bamburg et al . , 1999 ; Carlier et al . , 1999 ) . ADF / cofilin increases the rate of depolymerization from pointed ends of actin filaments ( Carlier et al . , 1997 ; Maciver et al . , 1998 ) and severs filaments , thereby increasing the number of free ends ( Maciver et al . , 1991 ; Ichetovkin et al . , 2000 ) . These two activities can be uncoupled by point mutations ( Moriyama and Yahara , 1999 ; Pope et al . , 2000 ; Ono et al . , 2001 ) . The severing activity of ADF / cofilin is correlated with its binding to the side of filaments ( Ono et al . , 2001 ) . When ADF / cofilin binds to actin filaments , it changes the twist of the filaments ( McGough et al . , 1997 ) which distorts the helical structure and increases the chance of filament breakage ( McGough and Chiu , 1999 ) . Genetic studies have shown that mutations that abolish only severing or F - actin binding by ADF / cofilin cause abnormal actin assembly in Caenorhabditis elegans ( Ono et al . , 1999 ) or severe defects in actin turnover and viability in yeast ( Lappalainen and Drubin , 1997 ; Lappalainen et al . , 1997 ) , whereas a mutation that only impairs the depolymerizing activity causes no apparent phenotype in yeast ( Moriyama and Yahara , 1999 ) . In motile cells , ADF / cofilin is accumulated in lamellipodia ( Bamburg and Bray , 1987 ; Svitkina and Borisy , 1999 ) and involved in the increase in the number of free barbed ends at the leading edge upon growth factor stimulation ( Chan et al . , 2000 ) . Thus , although biochemical studies suggest that the effects of ADF / cofilin at the filament ends are sufficient to enhance actin turnover to a physiological range ( Carlier et al . , 1997 ; Didry et al . , 1998 ) , accumulated evidence suggests Address correspondence to Shoichiro Ono , Dept . of Pathology , Emory University , 615 Michael St . , Whitehead Research Bldg . , Rm . 105N , Atlanta , GA 30322 .

The activity of ADF / cofilin can be inhibited by several mechanisms , including phosphorylation of ADF / cofilin at a conserved serine residue ( Morgan et al . , 1993 ; Agnew et al . , 1995 ; Moriyama et al . , 1996 ) , binding of phosphoino - sitides with ADF / cofilin ( Yonezawa et al . , 1990 ; Van Troys et al . , 2000 ) , and competition with tropomyosin ( TM ) ( Bernstein and Bamburg , 1982 ; Nishida et al . , 1984 ) . Regulation of ADF / cofilin by phosphorylation / de - phosphorylation or phosphoinositides is likely to be in - volved in cytoskeletal reorganization by intracellular sig - naling . However , the role of the competition of ADF / cofilin with TM is not clear . In biochemical studies , TM has been shown to protect actin depolymerization by chicken ADF ( Bernstein and Bamburg , 1982 ) or slow down the kinetics of depolymerization by starfish depactin ( Mabuchi , 1982 ) or porcine destrin ( Nishida et al . , 1985 ) . Cofilins from porcine brain ( Nishida et al . , 1984 ) and chicken muscle ( Abe et al . , 1989 ) strongly bind to F - actin and dissociate TM from the filaments . This competition is not due to their overlapping binding sites on actin , but rather to different filament structures when TM or ADF / cofilin is bound ( McGough , 1998 ) . Microinjection of chicken myotubes with a high concentration of cofilin re - sults in dissociation of TM from myofibrils ( Nagaoka et al . , 1995 ) . In the growth factor – stimulated lamellipodia , cofilin is enriched at the leading edge , but TM is not present in the same region ( Ogniewski Des Marais , V . M . , I . Ichetovkin , M . Bailly , A . Chan , J . S . Condeelis , and S . E . Hitchcock - DeGregorio . 2001 . 418 American Society for Cell Biology Annual Meeting . 2330 [ Abstr . ] . ) . In budding yeast , cofilin is localized to cortical actin patches ( Moon et al . , 1993 ) , whereas TM is localized to actin cables ( Liu and Bretscher , 1989 ) . In TM - null cells , cofilin is associated with actin cables ( Belmont and Drubin , 1998 ) which could explain why actin cables are rapidly disassembled in conditional TM mutant cells at restrictive temperature ( Pruyne et al . , 1998 ) . Previous studies have suggested that TM has a function to stabilize actin filaments ( Pittenger et al . , 1994 ; Lin et al . , 1997 ) . TM directly affects the dynamic properties of actin by inhibiting spontaneous actin polymerization ( Lal and Korn , 1986 ; Hitchcock - DeGregori et al . , 1988 ) and depolymerization from the pointed ends ( Broschat et al . , 1989 ; Broschat , 1990 ) . In addition , TM inhibits Arp2 / 3 - nucleated actin polymerization ( Blanchoin et al . , 2001 ) . Thus , these observations suggest that TM and ADF / cofilin regulate actin dynamics in opposite ways . However , it is not known whether these antagonistic effects are impor - tant for morphogenetic processes or stability of certain cy - toskeletal structures . In striated muscles , TM is a major thin filament protein and , together with troponin , regulates actomyosin interac - tion ( Gordon et al . , 2000 ) . In spite of extensive investiga - tions of TM in muscle contraction , its role in assembly and maintenance of myofibrils is currently unknown . Homozy - gous (cid:2) - TM – null mice are embryonic lethal , whereas het - erozygous knockout mice show no obvious phenotype ( Blanchard et al . , 1997 ; Rethinasamy et al . , 1998 ) . In Drosophila , mutations of a muscle TM isoform cause pe - ripheral disruption of myofibrils and alterations in their mechanical properties ( Kreuz et al . , 1996 ) . However , the structural defects in the central region of myofibrils are rel - atively mild , suggesting that TM is not very important for initial assembly of myofibrils ( Kreuz et al . , 1996 ) . In C . el - egans , TM is encoded by a single gene , lev - 11 / tmy - 1 , that gives rise to at least four TM isoforms ( Kagawa et al . , 1995 ; Anyanful et al . , 2001 ) . Mutations of this gene cause embryonic arrest at the twofold stage , but the actin organi - zation in body wall muscle is not significantly altered ( Wil - liams and Waterston , 1994 ) . One of the severe mutations introduces a premature stop codon at the end of exon 1 ( Anyanful et al . , 2001 ) . However , due to the presence of multiple promoters and complex splicing patterns , it is not known how this mutation changes the composition of TM isoforms in the mutant muscle . We have determined that UNC - 60B , a muscle - specific ADF / cofilin isoform , is required for proper assembly of actin into myofibrils in C . elegans ( Ono et al . , 1999 ) . Biochemical studies suggest that UNC - 60B enhances actin filament dy - namics by depolymerizing and severing actin filaments ( Ono and Benian , 1998 ; Ono et al . , 1999 ) . However , myofibrils are very stable cytoskeletal structures . Therefore , we hypoth - esized the presence of a factor that inhibits UNC - 60B – dependent actin dynamics and stabilizes actin filaments in myofibrils . Here , we present evidence that TM is a strong candidate for a physiological inhibitor of UNC - 60B . Results Purification and characterization of C . elegans tropomyosin Previously , Harris et al . ( 1977 ) reported purification of TM from C . elegans and its ability to bind to rabbit muscle actin . Here , we purified TM from wild - type C . elegans using a modified method and further characterized its biochemical Figure 1 . Purification and actin - binding activity of CeTM . ( A ) CeTM was purified from the soluble proteins after boiling worm extracts by ammonium sulfate fractionation ( a ) and Mono - Q column chromatography ( b ) . ( B ) Binding of CeTM to Ce - actin was analyzed by a cosedimentation assay . Varied concentrations of CeTM were incubated with 10 (cid:3) M F - Ce - actin and fractionated into supernatant ( free ) and pellets ( bound ) by ultracentrifugation . They were analyzed by SDS - PAGE ( 10 % gel ) and quantified by densitometric analysis of the Coomassie - stained gel . on J u l y 7 , 2017 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m Role of tropomyosin in actin dynamics | Ono and Ono 1067 properties . Purified TM ( CeTM ) migrated as a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 40 kD in SDS - PAGE ( Fig . 1 A ) , as reported previously ( Harris et al . , 1977 ) . CeTM shared two other biochemical properties with other TMs ( Smillie , 1982 ) : ( a ) CeTM was stable after boiling for 15 min ; ( b ) elec - trophoretic mobility of CeTM was greatly retarded in the presence of 6 M urea ( unpublished data ) . CeTM bound to C . elegans F - actin ( Ce - actin ) ( Fig . 1 B ) . Binding of CeTM to ac - Figure 2 . CeTM or UNC - 60B interacts with F - Ce - actin in a mutually exclusive manner . ( A and B ) 10 (cid:3) M F - actin was preincubated with or without 30 (cid:3) M UNC - 60B for 30 min , and , then , varied concentrations of CeTM were added to the mixtures . After 30 min , the reactions were analyzed by a cosedimentation assay . ( A ) Both supernatants ( s ) and pellets ( p ) were applied to Ca - SDS - PAGE ( 10 % acrylamide gel ) for a better separation of actin and CeTM . ( B ) Actin - bound CeTM or UNC - 60B was quantified by densitometric analysis . Because F - actin was partially depolymerized in the presence of UNC - 60B , the molar ratios of CeTM : actin or UNC - 60B : actin in the pellets were calculated and presented as a percentage of saturation , where 100 % was 1 : 7 for CeTM : actin or 1 : 1 for UNC - 60B : actin .

CeTM bound to rabbit muscle actin in a similar manner ( unpublished data ) . CeTM and UNC - 60B bind to F - actin in a mutually exclusive manner We used CeTM , Ce - actin , and C . elegans ADF / cofilin ( UNC - 60B ) to characterize their biochemical interactions . CeTM and UNC - 60B bound to F - actin in a mutually ex - clusive manner in vitro ( Fig . 2 ) . When UNC - 60B was pre - incubated with actin at a saturating concentration , binding of CeTM to actin was strongly inhibited ( Fig . 2 , A and B ) . CeTM at a high concentration ( 10 (cid:3) M ) failed to replace UNC - 60B . Similarly , when CeTM was preincubated with F - actin at a saturating concentration , binding of UNC - 60B to F - actin was inhibited ( Fig . 2 , C and D ) . Never - theless , increasing amounts of UNC - 60B decreased ac - tin - bound CeTM and , instead , increased actin - bound UNC - 60B ( Fig . 2 D ) , indicating that UNC - 60B competed with CeTM for actin binding . CeTM also inhibited UNC - 60B – induced depolymerization of F - actin ( Fig . 2 E ) . However , partial depolymerization still occurred in the presence of CeTM , which is probably due to partial disso - ciation of CeTM from F - actin . This incomplete inhibition suggests that , although CeTM protects F - actin from UNC - 60B , it still allows UNC - 60B – mediated actin fila - ment turnover to a limited extent . Taken together , these results suggest that CeTM and UNC - 60B bind to F - actin in a mutually exclusive manner . CeTM inhibits UNC - 60B – induced enhancement of actin polymerization UNC - 60B enhances the elongation rate of spontaneous actin polymerization by severing actin filaments and increasing the number of filament ends ( Ono et al . , 1999 ) . At a molar ratio of 0 . 2 : 1 of UNC - 60B to actin , the elongation phase ( 700 – 1 , 000 s ) of polymerization was accelerated and the kinetics reached a plateau at 1 , 500 s ( Fig . 3 ) . However , CeTM strongly inhibited this activity ( Fig . 3 ) . At a molar ratio of 0 . 2 : 0 . 2 : 1 of CeTM : UNC - 60B : actin , the kinetics of polymerization was indistin - guishable from that of actin alone ( Fig . 3 ) . The inhibition was observed when UNC - 60B was increased up to a ratio of 0 . 2 : 1 : 1 of CeTM : UNC - 60B : actin ( unpublished data ) . In contrast , CeTM itself did not show an apparent effect on actin polymer - ization ( Fig . 3 ) . The slight increase in the turbidity in the pres - ence of CeTM is probably due to binding of CeTM to F - actin as we confirmed by a pelleting assay ( unpublished data ) . The re - sults suggest that CeTM is a strong inhibitor of filament sever - ing by UNC - 60B . CeTM is a major component of thin filaments and excludes UNC - 60B To obtain evidence for in vivo competition between CeTM and UNC - 60B for actin binding , native thin filaments were Figure 3 .

( C ) The salt - extracted thin filaments ( P2 ) were further examined for their interaction with CeTM and UNC - 60B . The P2 fraction in A was resuspended with 0 – 2 . 0 (cid:3) M CeTM and incubated for 30 min . Then , a final 10 (cid:3) M of UNC - 60B was added to some reactions ( (cid:5) ) , and after 30 min of incubation they were analyzed by a cosedimentation assay . on J u l y 7 , 2017 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m Role of tropomyosin in actin dynamics | Ono and Ono 1069 isolated from wild - type worms and their components exam - ined . Actin and CeTM were detected as two major compo - nents of the thin filaments ( Fig . 4 B , lane P3 ) . UNC - 60B was detected in the thin filament fraction by Western blot , but not visible by Coomassie staining of the gel ( unpub - lished data ) . Quantification of actin , CeTM , and UNC - 60B revealed that actin binding by CeTM is nearly saturated in the thin filaments ( actin : CeTM (cid:6) 1 : 0 . 141 (cid:6) 7 . 09 : 1 ) and UNC - 60B is a very minor component ( actin : UNC - 60B (cid:6) 1 : 9 . 44 (cid:7) 10 (cid:8) 7 (cid:6) 1 . 06 (cid:7) 10 6 : 1 ) ( Table 1 ) . There are two possible explanations for the poor associa - tion of UNC - 60B with the thin filaments : ( a ) interaction of UNC - 60B with actin is prevented by some factors ; or ( b ) UNC - 60B was dissociated from F - actin during the fractionation . To test if UNC - 60B is able to bind to the thin filaments , active recombinant UNC - 60B was incu - bated with the isolated thin filaments and their possible interaction was examined by a cosedimentation assay , ( Fig . 4 ) . Recombinant UNC - 60B cosedimented with thin fila - ments only at a trace amount ( Fig . 4 B , lane P4 ) and caused partial actin depolymerization and dissociation of CeTM from the filaments ( Fig . 4 B , compare S3 and S4 ) . When the thin filaments were extracted with a buffer con - taining 0 . 6 M KCl , most of CeTM and several other pro - teins were dissociated from the filaments and released into the supernatant ( Fig . 4 B , lane S2 ) . After the high - salt ex - traction , UNC - 60B was able to bind to the filaments ( Fig . 4 B , lane P6 ) . There was no detectable difference in these interactions in the presence or absence of Ca 2 (cid:5) ( unpub - lished data ) . The results indicate that binding of UNC - 60B to thin filaments is inhibited by a component ( s ) of the thin filaments that can be extracted by a high concen - tration of salt . Because CeTM was the major protein that was ex - tracted by high salt ( Fig . 4 B , lane S2 ) , it was a likely component that inhibited UNC - 60B binding to the fila - ments . We experimentally confirmed the role of CeTM in this competition by an in vitro reconstitution ( Fig . 4 C ) . After thin filaments had been extracted by 0 . 6 M KCl and resuspended in a buffer containing 0 . 1 M KCl , puri - fied CeTM was added back to the filaments ( Fig . 4 C , lanes e and f ) . The added CeTM bound to the filaments ( Fig . 4 C , lane f ) . This addition of CeTM was sufficient to inhibit UNC - 60B binding to the filaments ( Fig . 4 C , compare lanes d and h ) . This inhibitory effect of CeTM was dose dependent , such that filament binding by UNC - 60B was increased when added CeTM was de - creased ( Fig . 4 C , lanes g – l ) . These results indicate that CeTM is sufficient to inhibit binding of UNC - 60B to muscle thin filaments . CeTM and UNC - 60B are localized in different patterns during muscle development Relative localization of CeTM and UNC - 60B during mus - cle development was examined in wild - type C . elegans em - bryos by immunofluorescence microscopy ( Fig . 5 ) . Both UNC - 60B and CeTM became detectable in muscle cells at a very early stage of muscle development ( (cid:2) 290 min ) , nearly at the same time ( Fig . 5 , a and b ) . At the comma stage ( 290 – 350 min ) , both UNC - 60B and CeTM are diffusely localized in the cytoplasm and positions of nuclei are devoid of stain - ing ( Fig . 5 , a – d ; DAPI staining of the nuclei is not shown ) . After the 1 . 5 - fold stage ( (cid:2) 430 min ) , CeTM was gradually localized to a narrow region ( Fig . 5 f ) which represented myo - fibrils as determined by double staining with anti - actin an - Table I .

This differential localization of UNC - 60B and CeTM was maintained throughout the later embryonic development ( Fig . 5 , g and h ) . In adult body wall muscle , CeTM and UNC - 60B were also localized to different regions of thin filaments ( Fig . 6 ) . Interestingly , the staining patterns of CeTM and actin were different ( Fig . 6 , A – C ) . CeTM was localized in linear pat - terns ( Fig . 6 B ) , whereas actin was localized in ladder - like patterns ( Fig . 6 A ) in which the regions of dense bodies were devoid of staining ( Francis and Waterston , 1985 ) . UNC - 60B was stained as dotted lines ( Fig . 6 E ) between two lines of CeTM with little overlapping zones ( Fig . 6 D ) . Double staining of actin and UNC - 60B showed that UNC - 60B was localized to the central areas of the actin ladders between dense bodies ( Fig . 6 , G – I ) . Double staining of vinculin , as a marker for dense bodies , and UNC - 60B revealed that UNC - 60B filled the gaps between dense bodies but was not colocalized with them ( Fig . 6 , J – L ) . We also noted that the shape of the UNC - 60B – positive dots was irregular ( Fig . 6 , E , H , and K ) , suggesting that association of UNC - 60B with myofibrils is unstable and dynamic . As summarized in Fig . 6 M , actin filaments in the nematode body wall muscle are ob - liquely aligned with their barbed ends attached to the mid - dle of the I - bands , where dense bodies are located instead of Z - lines in vertebrate striated muscles . Our results show that CeTM is associated with the outer parts of the I - bands , whereas UNC - 60B is localized near the barbed ends of the actin filaments . Suppression of CeTM causes disorganization of actin filaments in wild - type , but not in unc - 60 mutants To address the role of CeTM in the actin filament organiza - tion in vivo we suppressed the expression of CeTM by RNA - mediated interference ( RNAi ) and examined its effect on the actin cytoskeleton . The C . elegans TM gene , tmy - 1 , gives rise to at least four isoforms using two different pro - moters and alternative splicing ( Kagawa et al . , 1995 ; Anyan - ful et al . , 2001 ) . The promoter analysis by Kagawa and col - leagues ( 1995 ) has suggested that CeTMI and CeTMII are expressed in body wall muscle , whereas CeTMIII and Ce - TMIV are expressed in pharyngeal muscle . However , the ac - tual tissue distribution of these proteins was not extensively studied . Therefore , we constructed two vectors for RNAi : ( a ) pTM1 contains a common sequence for CeTMI and CeTMII , but not for CeTMIII and CeTMIV ; and ( b ) pTM2 contains a common sequence for all four isoforms . dsRNAs were expressed from these vectors in bacteria and delivered into worms by feeding with them . pTM1 and pTM2 successfully suppressed the expression of CeTM to different extents ( Fig . 7 A ) . pTM1 and pTM2 reduced the amount of CeTM to (cid:2) 50 % and 10 % , respectively , as com - pared to wild - type worms grown under standard conditions . A control vector with no CeTM insert had no effect on the level of CeTM ( Fig . 7 A ) . The levels of UNC - 60B and actin were not significantly affected by CeTM RNAi ( Fig . 7 A ) . CeTM RNAi affected motility of (cid:2) 100 % of wild - type worms examined , which became slow or paralyzed ( Fig . 7 B ) . pTM1 caused slightly mild effects : the worms could slowly move , but their tails tended to bend whereas the anterior halves of their bodies did not move well ( Fig . 7 , B and D ) . pTM2 produced much more severe paralysis , and the affected worms barely moved ( Fig . 7 , B and E ) . The motility defects in CeTM - suppressed worms were most severe when they were L4 larva to adults . In both cases , the affected worms were sterile and laid no eggs ( Fig 7 , D and E ) , but the reason for this is currently under investiga - tion . In contrast , CeTM RNAi did not worsen motility of an ADF / cofilin mutant strain ( Fig . 7 , B and F – H ) . unc - 60 ( r398 ) is a weak loss - of - function allele that has a premature stop codon in the unc - 60B coding region , which truncates three amino acids from the C terminus . The r398 mutant UNC - 60B protein binds to G - actin , but is unable to bind to and sever F - actin ( Ono et al . , 1999 , 2001 ) . unc - 60 ( r398 ) homozygotes move much slower than wild - type ( Ono et al . , 1999 ) and control RNAi with no CeTM inserts had no de - tectable effects on motility ( Fig . 7 B ) . Interestingly , pTM1 slightly improved motility , whereas pTM2 did not have ap - parent effects on motility ( Fig . 7 , B and G ) . The protein lev - els of CeTM were decreased in the unc - 60 animals to a simi - lar extent to those in wild - type ( Fig . 7 A ) . A t - test suggests that pTM1 produced significantly different effects from the control ( P (cid:9) 0 . 01 ) , but pTM2 did not ( P (cid:10) 0 . 05 ) . In addi - tion , CeTM RNAi did not affect fecundity of unc - 60 ( r398 ) Figure 6 . Localization of UNC - 60B and CeTM in adult body wall muscle .

The CeTM - suppressed unc - 60 mutants laid many fertilized eggs ( Fig . 7 , G and H ) and produced equiva - lent number of progeny to the mutant worms under stan - dard culture conditions . Phalloidin staining of body wall muscle revealed that sup - pression of CeTM caused disorganization of actin filaments in wild - type but did not worsen the phenotype in unc - 60 mutants ( Fig . 8 ) . In wild - type , striated organization of actin filaments were disrupted by CeTM RNAi and abnormal wavy bundles were formed in body wall muscle ( Fig . 8 , C and E ) . In the unc - 60 ( r398 ) mutants , although aggregates of actin were formed , some filaments were organized into striated patterns in the center of the cells under the control conditions ( Fig . 8 B ) . However , CeTM RNAi did not cause major alterations in the actin filament organization in this unc - 60 mutant ( Fig . 8 , D and F ) . These results suggest that in CeTM - suppressed cells , actin filaments are destabilized in wild - type , whereas they are stable when the activity of ADF / cofilin is decreased . In CeTM - suppressed cells , UNC - 60B was unevenly dis - tributed in the cells and associated with bundles where actin was also localized ( Fig . 9 , B , D , and F ) , whereas , in the con - trol cells , UNC - 60B was evenly distributed and associated with a part of myofibrils ( Fig 9 , A , C , and E ) . The UNC - 60B – decorated bundles in CeTM - suppressed cells did not appear to be normal myofibril structures . These bundles were often thick and sometimes wavy ( Fig . 9 B ) . This is strong evidence that UNC - 60B heavily binds to a subset of Figure 7 . Effects of suppression of CeTM on worm motility .

CeTM is mislocalized in an unc - 60 mutant On the other hand , in the unc - 60 ( r398 ) mutant cells , con - siderably strong staining of CeTM was found in the aggre - gates , whereas some striated staining of CeTM in the myo - fibrils was present as well ( Fig . 10 A ) . The r398 mutant UNC - 60B protein was predominantly localized in the ag - gregates but barely detectable in the striated myofibrils ( Fig . 10 B ) . Because the r398 mutant UNC - 60B protein binds to G - actin but fails to bind to F - actin in vitro ( Ono et al . , 1999 ) , the aggregates may contain both G - and F - actin . These results suggest that integration of CeTM into myo - fibrils depends on proper reorganization of actin filaments by UNC - 60B . Discussion In this study , we provide both in vitro and in vivo evidence that TM inhibits ADF / cofilin - mediated actin filament dy - namics . Biochemical experiments using purified C . elegans proteins show that binding of TM or ADF / cofilin to F - actin is mutually exclusive . TM and ADF / cofilin are localized in different patterns in muscle cells . Suppression of TM dis - rupts actin filament organization in wild - type genetic back - ground but not in an ADF / cofilin mutant background . These experimental results support a cellular mechanism that TM plays a role in regulating actin filament dynamics by competing with ADF / cofilin for F - actin binding . Previous biochemical studies have shown that binding of TM to F - actin inhibits interaction of ADF / cofilin with ac - tin . However , our study is the first to demonstrate biochem - ical interaction and competition of these three proteins from a single organism and confirms the competition between TM and ADF / cofilin . Binding of UNC - 60B with F - actin was relatively stable in vitro , so that when UNC - 60B and ac - tin preformed a complex , CeTM did not readily replace UNC - 60B . However , early muscle development is a rapid process that takes only 2 h from expression of muscle genes to forming contractile apparatuses ( Epstein et al . , 1993 ; Hresko et al . , 1994 ) . We observed expression of UNC - 60B and CeTM as early as 290 min after the first cleavage , and localization of CeTM to the myofibrils at 420 min . This rapid reorganization suggests that there is a mechanism to enhance dynamic exchange of actin - bound UNC - 60B with CeTM during muscle development . Candidates for such regulatory factors include a family of LIM - kinases that phos - phorylate ADF / cofilins and inhibit their actin binding ( Ar - ber et al . , 1998 ; Yang et al . , 1998 ) , and phosphoinositides that bind to ADF / cofilins and compete for actin binding ( Yonezawa et al . , 1990 ; Van Troys et al . , 2000 ) . The role of LIM - kinases in muscle cells has not been reported . In con - trast , phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate has been impli - cated in inhibition of cofilin - induced actin reorganization in chicken skeletal muscle cells ( Nagaoka et al . , 1995 ) . In the isolated nematode thin filaments , UNC - 60B is a minor component . Our in vitro reconstitution experiments suggest that CeTM excludes UNC - 60B from the thin fila - ments . However , we noted that UNC - 60B bound to actin in the thin filaments at a lesser amount than to purified ac - tin , even after CeTM was removed by the high - salt extrac - tion . This observation suggests that thin filaments have other factors that prevent UNC - 60B from binding to them . A strong candidate of such a factor is UNC - 87 , a calponin - like protein ( Goetinck and Waterston , 1994a ) . UNC - 87 is localized to thin filaments in C . elegans body wall muscle and essential for maintenance of myofibril structures ( Goe - tinck and Waterston , 1994b ) . UNC - 87 binds to TM - bound actin filaments in vitro ( Kranewitter et al . , 2001 ) . When UNC - 87 is expressed in mammalian cells , it is localized to stress fibers and remains associated with cytoskeletal frac - tions after extraction with 0 . 8 M KCl ( Kranewitter et al . , 2001 ) . Therefore , the extraction of the nematode thin fila - Figure 9 . Effects of suppression of CeTM on localization of UNC - 60B .

It will be interesting to examine the effect of UNC - 87 and other calponin - like proteins on ADF / cofilin - mediated actin filament dynamics . Interestingly , in chicken muscle cells , when the myofibrils become mature , microinjected cofilin replaces TM on myo - fibrils without disrupting the myofibril structure ( Nagaoka et al . , 1995 ) , suggesting the presence of an actin filament stabilizer in addition to TM . By immunostaining , we found that UNC - 60B was local - ized to the center of the I - bands where CeTM was not found . However , UNC - 60B was a very minor component in our thin filament preparations . This discrepancy might be because UNC - 60B – bound filaments were unstable , so that they were disassembled during the preparation . Alterna - tively , UNC - 60B might be associated with structural com - ponents other than actin filaments . In the previous model of the C . elegans body wall muscle , thin filaments are proposed to be anchored to dense bodies which are 1 . 5 – 2 . 0 (cid:3) m apart from each other ( Waterston , 1988 ) . If this model is correct , the staining of actin would become discontinuous and be absent in the center of the I - bands . However , actual staining for actin appears as continuous lines in the I - bands and is present in the center of the I - bands between dense bodies . Therefore , it would be more likely that the thin filaments are attached not only to dense bodies but also to regions be - tween dense bodies where UNC - 60B is localized . Indeed , in the ultrastructure of body wall muscle of the nematode As - caris , dense bodies are linked together by strands of the “sup - porting fibrils , ” which are located throughout the center of the I - bands ( Rosenbluth , 1965 , 1967 ) . Therefore , the equiv - alent structure may be present in C . elegans and function as a scaffold for thin filaments and UNC - 60B . We demonstrated that suppression of CeTM expression by RNAi caused disorganization of muscle actin filaments in wild - type but not in an unc - 60 mutant strain . In the CeTM - suppressed worms , the phenotypes were most severe when they were adults , suggesting that , after assembly of myo - fibrils , actin filaments are gradually deteriorated by the activ - ity of UNC - 60B . That also implies that UNC - 60B is still active in mature muscle cells and has the ability to enhance actin dynamics . The competitiveness between TM and ADF / cofilin suggests that the balance of two kinds of fac - tors , stabilizers and destabilizers of actin filaments , is impor - tant for maintaining the integrity of myofibrils . In C . ele - gans , enhancers of actin dynamics , UNC - 60B ( ADF / cofilin ) ( Ono et al . , 1999 ) and UNC - 78 ( actin - interacting protein 1 ) ( Ono , 2001 ) , are required for assembly of actin into myo - fibrils . However , it is not clear whether these factors are im - portant for maintenance of myofibrils because mutations of these genes cause formation of disorganized myofibrils from the assembly stage in embryos . Myofibrils are a form of very stable actin cytoskeleton , and yet myofibrils in cultured muscle cells are capable of incorporating microinjected actin without altering the length of the thin filaments ( Imanaka - Yoshida et al . , 1993 ; Komiyama et al . , 1993 ; Littlefield et al . , 2001 ) . In mammals , a muscle - specific cofilin isoform is expressed in striated muscles ( Ono et al . , 1994 ; Mohri et al . , 2000 ; Thirion et al . , 2001 ) and is a strong candidate for an enhancer of actin dynamics . To understand this problem , a conditional allele of ADF / cofilin would allow us to investi - gate a role of ADF / cofilin and its functional relationship with stabilizers of actin filaments after functional myofibrils had been assembled . Materials and methods Nematode strains Nematodes were grown at 20 (cid:11) C as described ( Brenner , 1974 ) . Wild - type strain N2 was obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center ( St . Paul , MN ) . unc - 60 ( r398 ) was described previously ( McKim et al . , 1988 ) . Proteins Actin was purified from wild - type C . elegans as described ( Ono , 1999 ) . Recombinant UNC - 60B was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described ( Ono and Benian , 1998 ) . Purification of tropomyosin from wild - type C . elegans Frozen nematodes ( 30 – 40 ml as packed volume ) were thawed in 2 vol ( 1 vol refers to an initial volume of packed worms ) of a homogenizing buffer ( 50 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 20 mM Tris - HCl , 1 mM DTT , 1 mM PMSF , pH 8 . 0 ) , and homogenized by passing twice through a French pressure cell at 5 , 000 – 8 , 000 lb / in 2 . The homogenate was centrifuged at 10 , 000 g for 10 min , and the pellet was washed twice by suspending in the homogenizing buffer and pelleting at 10 , 000 g for 10 min . The washed pellet was ex - tracted with 1 vol of 0 . 6 M KCl , 5 mM ATP , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM EGTA , 20 mM Tris - HCl , 1 mM DTT , 1 mM PMSF , pH 8 . 0 , and centrifuged at 10 , 000 g for 10 min . The extraction was repeated once more . The com - bined supernatant was mixed with 1 / 20 vol of 10 % Triton X - 100 and cen - trifuged at 100 , 000 g for 2 h . The supernatant was heated in a boiling wa - ter bath for 15 min , and then centrifuged at 10 , 000 g for 15 min . The supernatant was fractionated at 55 – 80 % saturation of ammonium sulfate and dialyzed extensively against 0 . 1 M KCl , 20 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 . It was applied to a Mono - Q column that had been equilibrated with the same buffer and eluted with a linear gradient of KCl ( 0 . 1 – 0 . 6 M ) . CeTM was eluted at 0 . 44 – 0 . 48 M KCl . The fractions containing pure CeTM were dialyzed against 0 . 1 M KCl , 20 mM Hepes - NaOH , pH 7 . 5 , and concen - trated by Centricon ( MWCO 30 , 000 ) ( Millipore ) . The protein concentra - tion was determined by a BCA Protein Assay Kit ( Pierce Chemical Co . ) . The molar concentration of CeTM was calculated as a dimer using a M r of 66 , 000 that was deduced from the cDNA sequences of CeTMI and CeTMII ( Kagawa et al . , 1995 ) . Assays for actin - binding and actin polymerization Cosedimentation assays of Ce - actin with UNC - 60B and / or CeTM were performed as described previously ( Ono and Benian , 1998 ) in a buffer containing 0 . 1 M KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 20 mM Hepes - NaOH , 1 mM DTT , pH 7 . 5 . Ultracentrifugation was performed with a Beckman Airfuge at 28 psi for 20 min . The supernatants and pellets were adjusted to the same volume and analyzed by SDS - PAGE . In standard SDS - PAGE , actin and CeTM mi - grated so closely that densitometric quantification of the two bands was very difficult . We found that inclusion of CaCl 2 at 1 mM in a 10 % poly - acrylamide gel and at 0 . 1 mM in running buffer slightly retards the migra - tion of actin , but not CeTM . Therefore , calcium - containing electrophoresis was used for densitometric analysis of CeTM and Ce - actin . The kinetics of spontaneous actin polymerization was monitored as changes in turbidity at a wavelength of 310 nm ( Carlier et al . , 1997 ) under conditions as described previously ( Ono et al . , 1999 ) . Isolation of nematode thin filaments Nematode thin filaments were isolated as described by Harris et al . ( Harris et al . , 1977 ) with slight modifications . Nematodes ( 6 ml as a pellet ) were suspended in 12 ml of Buffer A ( 50 mM NaCl , 10 mM Imidazole , 1 mM EDTA , 5 mM DTT , 1 mM PMSF , pH 7 . 0 ) and homogenized by passing twice through a French pressure cell at 5 , 000 – 8 , 000 lb / in 2 . The homoge - nate was centrifuged at 8 , 000 g for 10 min , and the pellet was washed twice by suspending in Buffer A and pelleting at 8 , 000 g for 10 min . The pellet was extracted 3 min on ice in 4 ml of a buffer containing 50 mM KCl , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM EGTA , 5 mM ATP , 10 mM MES - KOH , 1 mM DTT , 1 mM PMSF , pH 6 . 0 and centrifuged at 10 , 000 g for 10 min . The su - pernatant , which is designated as “worm low - salt / ATP extract , ” was ultra - centrifuged at 140 , 000 g for 20 min . The resultant pellet contained actin and TM as major components and was considered as a thin filament frac - tion . The protein concentration was determined by a BCA Protein Assay on J u l y 7 , 2017 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m 1074 The Journal of Cell Biology | Volume 156 , Number 6 , 2002 Kit ( Pierce Chemical Co . ) . Amounts of Ce - actin and CeTM in the thin fila - ment fraction were quantified on Coomassie - stained gels followed by a densitometric analysis using purified Ce - actin and CeTM as standards . Amounts of UNC - 60B in the thin filaments were quantified by Western blot with anti – UNC - 60B antibody using purified UNC - 60B as a standard . Quantification was performed in ranges where band intensity of the stan - dard proteins was linearly correlated with their amounts . Cosedimentation assays with thin filaments The worm low - salt / ATP extract ( 50 (cid:3) l at 1 . 5 mg / ml ) was supplemented with the same volume of 50 mM or 3 M KCl solutions to adjust KCl to final 50 mM or 0 . 6 M and ultracentrifuged by a Beckman Airfuge at 28 psi for 20 min . The pellets were resuspended in 0 . 1 M KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT , 20 mM Hepes - NaOH , pH 7 . 5 , by gentle pipetting , incubated with or without 10 (cid:3) M UNC - 60B in a total volume of 50 (cid:3) l for 30 min at room temperature , and ultracentrifuged by a Beckman Airfuge at 28 psi for 20 min . Both supernatants and pellets were adjusted to 100 (cid:3) l and analyzed by SDS - PAGE . For reconstitution with CeTM , after the worm low - salt / ATP extract was treated with 0 . 6 M KCl and ultracentrifuged , the pellets were resuspended in 0 . 1 M KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT , 20 mM Hepes - NaOH , pH 7 . 5 , with 0 to 2 . 0 (cid:3) M of purified CeTM in a total volume of 50 (cid:3) l , and incu - bated for 15 min at room temperature . They were then supplemented with UNC - 60B at final volume of 10 (cid:3) M or the same volume of the buffer , in - cubated for 30 min at room temperature , and ultracentrifuged by a Beck - man Airfuge at 28 psi for 20 min . Production of antibodies Purified CeTM was used to immunize guinea pigs by a standard protocol at Spring Valley Laboratories ( Woodvine , MD ) . The antiserum was specific for CeTM by Western blot without further purification and used at 1 : 500 to 1 : 1 , 000 dilutions for Western blot and immunofluorescent staining . Fluorescent microscopy Worm embryos were obtained by cutting adults on poly - lysine – coated slides , freeze cracked as described ( Epstein et al . , 1993 ) , and fixed with methanol at – 20 (cid:11) C for 5 min , and , subsequently , with 4 % formaldehyde in cytoskeleton buffer ( 138 mM KCl , 3 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM EGTA , 10 mM MES - KOH , pH 6 . 0 ) containing 0 . 32 M sucrose ( Cramer and Mitchison , 1993 ) for 15 min at room temperature . They were washed with PBS containing 30 mM glycine for 10 min and stained with antibodies diluted in 1 % BSA in PBS . Anti - CeTM and anti – UNC - 60B antibodies were used as primary antibodies , which are visualized by Alexa488 - labeled goat anti – guinea pig IgG ( Molecular Probes ) and Cy3 - labeled goat anti – rabbit IgG ( Jackson Im - munoResearch Laboratories ) . Immunofluorescent staining of adult nema - todes was performed as described ( Finney and Ruvkun , 1990 ) using anti - CeTM , anti - UNC - 60B , anti - actin ( C4 ; ICN Biomedicals ) , or anti - vinculin ( MH24 ; Francis and Waterston , 1985 ) , provided by Dr . M . Hresko ( Wash - ington University School of Medicine , Seattle , WA ) . Phalloidin staining of adult worms was performed as described previously ( Ono , 2001 ) . Samples were viewed by epifluorescence using a Zeiss Axioskop microscope with a Plan - Neofluar 100 (cid:7) objective and photographs were taken on Kodak TMAX 400 film . The negatives were scanned at 2 , 400 dot per inch and the images processed by Adobe Photoshop 6 . 0 . RNA interference experiments Two fragments of cDNA for CeTM were amplified from a C . elegans cDNA library , provided by Dr . A . Fire ( Carnegie Institution of Washington , Wash - ington , D . C . ) by PCR with REDTaq DNA polymerase ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . TM1 is a 549 - bp fragment corresponding to position 5 – 553 of the cDNA for CeTMI ( GenBank / EMBL / DDBJ accession no . D38540 ) , which is common with CeTMII but not with CeTMIII and IV . TM2 is a 383 - bp fragment corre - sponding to position 839 – 1 , 221 of the cDNA for CeTMI , which is com - mon for all four isoforms . The amplified DNA fragments were digested by Bgl II and Nhe I at the sites introduced by the PCR primers and cloned into L4440 at the cloning site between two oppositely oriented T7 promoters ( Timmons and Fire , 1998 ) . Forward and reverse PCR primers for TM1 are 5 (cid:12) - CATGAGATCTCCCCTCCAATTTGAATCGTCG and 5 (cid:12) - CATGGCTAG - CTCGTATTTGCGGTCAGCCTCC . Forward and reverse PCR primers for TM2 are 5 (cid:12) - CATGAGATCTGAATTGGTGCACGAGAAGGAAC and 5 (cid:12) - CATGGCTAGCGCTGCCGGCTCTTGTAAACG . E . coli HT115 ( DE3 ) , an RNase III – deficient strain ( Timmons et al . , 2001 ) , was transformed with the L4440 vector with the CeTM inserts and used to suppress the expression of CeTM by RNA - mediated interference ( RNAi ) by feeding worms ( Timmons and Fire , 1998 ) . RNAi was performed essentially as described ( Fraser et al . , 2000 ) . Briefly , the transformed bacte - ria were cultured overnight at 37 (cid:11) C in LB containing 50 (cid:3) g / ml ampicillin , applied onto 10 - cm plates containing NGM agar with 1 mM IPTG and 25 (cid:3) g / ml carbenicillin , and incubated overnight at room temperature . Ten worms at the L4 stage were transferred onto the plates and cultured 24 h at 20 (cid:11) C . The worms were transferred onto new plates and cultured for 3 d at 20 (cid:11) C , and phenotypes were analyzed in their F1 generation . Western blot Worms were harvested off NGM plates with M9 buffer ( 22 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 42 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 85 . 5 mM NaCl , 1 mM MgSO 4 ) and washed with M9 three times . After removing M9 , the worms were suspended in SDS - lysis buffer ( 2 % SDS , 80 mM Tris - HCl , 5 % (cid:13) - mercaptoethanol , 15 % glycerol , 0 . 05 % bromophenol blue , pH 6 . 8 ) , heated at 97 (cid:11) C for 2 min , homoge - nized by brief sonication , and heated again at 97 (cid:11) C for 2 min . Protein con - centrations of the SDS lysates were determined by a filter paper dye - bind - ing assay ( Minamide and Bamburg , 1990 ) . 25 (cid:3) g of each lysate was separated on a 12 % SDS - polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto polyvi - nylidene difluoride membrane ( Immobilon - P ; Millipore ) . The membranes were blocked in 5 % nonfat milk in PBS containing 0 . 1 % Tween 20 and in - cubated for 1 h with anti - CeTM , anti - UNC - 60B or anti - actin ( C4 ) antibod - ies followed by treatment with peroxidase - labeled goat anti – guinea pig IgG ( ICN Biomedicals ) , goat anti – rabbit IgG ( Pierce Chemical Co . ) , or goat anti – mouse IgG ( Pierce Chemical Co . ) . The reactivities were detected with a SuperSignal chemiluminescence reagent ( Pierce Chemical Co . ) . Motility assay A motility assay was performed as described ( Epstein and Thomson , 1974 ) . Briefly , adult worms were placed in M9 buffer . Then , one beat was counted when a worm swung its head to either right or left . The total num - ber of beats in 30 s was recorded . We thank F .
