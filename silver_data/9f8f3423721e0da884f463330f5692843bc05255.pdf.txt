We observed that CTTN promotes cancer cell proliferation in vitro and increases CRC tumor xenograft growth in vivo . CTTN expression increases EGFR protein levels and enhances the activation of the MAPK signaling pathway . CTTN expression also inhibits the ubiquitin - mediated degradation of EGFR by suppressing the coupling of c - Cbl with EGFR . CoIP experiments indicate CTTN can interact with c - Cbl in CRC cells . These results demonstrate that CTTN promotes the proliferation of CRC cells and suppresses the degradation of EGFR . INTRODUCTION Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) has become the third most common cancer in men ( 746 , 000 cases , 10 . 0 % of the total ) , and the second most common in women ( 614 , 000 cases , 9 . 2 % of the total ) worldwide . Annually , colorectal cancer has led to about 694 , 000 deaths ( 8 . 5 % of the total ) [ 1 ] . Colorectal tumorigenesis follows the “multi - step adenoma – carcinoma sequence . ” This sequence includes a series of genetic mutations and epigenetic alterations leading to genetic instability , like APC , RAS , p53 , and the EGFR signaling pathway [ 2 – 4 ] . Defining these molecular alterations will help guide treatment and improve clinical care . Cortactin ( CTTN ) is a substrate of v - SRC . When it is bound with actin , this activates the Arp2 / 3 complex , modulation of cytoskeleton formation , and debranching of dendritic actin under the plasma [ 5 , 6 ] . CTTN is overexpressed in many tumors , across several cancers : head and neck , gastric , hepatocellular , and colorectal [ 7 ] . While Cortactin stimulates metastasis of cancer cells [ 8 , 9 ] , CTNN alsos inhibit down - regulation of the EGFR and MET signaling pathways [ 10 – 12 ] . Epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) is often overexpressed or mutated in a variety of cancers , like lung cancer and colorectal cancer [ 13 , 14 ] , and this leads to enhanced activation and tumorigenesis . The aim of this study is to investigate the biological role of CTTN in CRC and related molecules in the EGFR pathway . RESULTS CTTN is highly expressed in CRC tissues and correlates with pathological stage To explore the association of CTTN expression with clinicopathological parameters in CRC , we examined the mRNA expression of CTTN in 61 pairs CRC tissues by qRT - PCR . There is about 52 % of CRC specimens with CTTN mRNA upregulation ( 35 / 61 ) ( Figure 1A ) , and the Research Paper Oncotarget 1542 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget relative CTTN mRNA expression in CRC is higher than matched normal tissue ( Figure 1B ) . There is a positive correlation between CTTN mRNA expression and CRC tumor stage ( Figure 2C , 2D ) , and CTTN expression is not related to gender , age , or tumor site ( Supplementary information , Table S4 ) . We further examined CTTN protein expression in CRC and normal mucosa by immunohistochemistry . The weak staining of CTTN in normal mucosa is present in cytoplasm ( Figure 1F , 1G , 1H , Supplementary Figure S4 ) , while the expression of CTTN in CRC is much higher than the normal tissue with a strong staining . The above results imply that increased CTTN expression may be associated with the tumor progression of CRC , thus providing clues to further analyze its biological function and molecular mechanism in CRC progression . Suppression of CTTN inhibits cancer cell proliferation in vitro We made a CTTN expression assay in seven colorectal cancer cell lines using qRT - PCR and western blot ( Figure 2A ) . CTTN expression was highest in the SW1116 and HT - 29 cell lines , while the expression of mRNA and protein was much less in the SW480 line . Therefore , we adopted the SW1116 , HT - 29 , and SW480 cell lines as the cellular models to explore the function of CTTN in vitro . We used RNA interference ( RNAi ) to suppress CTTN expression . A pool of two different siRNAs including CTTN - siRNA 377 and siRNA 499 were applied , and the efficiency of each siRNA , or the pool of siRNA , was validated by qRT - PCR and western blot ( Figure 2B , 2C ) . The effect of knockdown of CTTN on the growth of HT - 29 and SW1116 was measured by the Cell Counting Kit - 8 ( CCK - 8 ) assay . The reduction of CTTN inhibited the growth of these two cell lines ( Figure 2D , 2E ) . To ascertain whether CTTN could promote cancer cell proliferation , we labeled cancer cells with the thymidine analog EdU after siRNA pool transfection to monitor the activity of DNA synthesis ( Figure 2F ) . The percentage of cells labeled with EdU in the CTTN - si group is lower than the control group ( Figure 2G ) . To further verify the effect of CTTN on CRC cells , we upregulated CTTN expression by lentiviral infection of CTTN - ORF plasmid in SW480 and SW1116 - sh182 ( in which the shRNA targets the 3’UTR of CTTN mRNA ) cell lines . CTTN overexpression was confirmed by immunoblotting ( Figure 2H ) . We measured the growth rate of SW480 - CTTN and SW1116 - sh182 + CTTN cell lines by CCK - 8 . These data demonstrate that CTTN overexpression promotes the growth of CRC cells ( Figure 2I , 2J ) . CTTN enhances CRC cell clonogenicity in vitro Transformed tumor cells can self - renew in an anchorage - independent or anchorage - dependent manner . This clonogenic ability is positively correlated with the metastasis of cancer cells [ 15 ] . To assay the effect of CTTN on clonogenic ability of CRC cells , we downregulated CTTN expression in HT - 29 and SW1116 cells via lentiviral infection . We designed a plasmid Figure 1 : Overexpression of CTTN in CRC tissues . A . The mRNA levels of CTTN in 61 paired CRC and matched non - tumor tissues were determined by qPCR .

Oncotarget 1544 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget including shRNA - 273 and shRNA - 275 , targeting two different sites of CTTN’ CDS ( Figure 3A ) . The results of plate clone formation and soft agar clonogenic assays showed that more , and larger , colonies formed in the control group than the corresponding CTTN - sh group ( Figure 3B , 3C ) . The SW480 CTTN and SW1116 - sh182 + CTTN cell lines , which overexpress CTTN , formed more colonies than the control group ( Figure 3D , 3E ) . These results suggest CTTN enhances the clonogenic ability of CRC cell lines , and this data is consistent with previous HNSCC studies [ 11 ] . Downregulation of CTTN suppresses tumor growth in vivo To further ascertain the proliferation role of CTTN in vivo , we adopted a xenograft animal model using the BALB / c nude mouse . SW1116 sh - Scramble and SW1116 sh - CTTN transfected cells were subcutaneously injected into mice . Knockdown of CTTN in SW1116 suppresses tumor growth in vivo ( Figure 4A ) . Additionally , tumor growth rate , size , and weight in the sh - CTTN group is much lower than the control group ( Figure 4B , 4C ) . Immunohistochemical staining of the tumor with Ki - 67 confirms the inhibition of cancer cell proliferation in sh - CTTN group ( Figure 4D ) . Tumor tissues of the sh - CTTN group have a lower percentage of Ki - 67 staining ( Figure 4E ) . The downregulation of CTTN is responsible for the suppression of tumor growth in vivo . CTTN enhances the activation of MAPK pathway CTTN promotes cancer cell mobility [ 16 – 19 ] , and Timpson’s research suggested CTTN inhibited EGFR ubiquitination and degradation in HNSCC [ 10 , 11 ] . We found the EGFR protein level in the CTTN - sh group was lower than the corresponding control group when the CRC cells were conventionally cultured . CTTN overexpression also increased the level of EGFR ( Supplementary Figure 3 : Downregulation of CTTN induces reduction of CRC cell clonogenicity . A .

CTTN overexpression increases the colony formation of SW480 and SW1116 CTTN - sh 182 cells . ( * P < 0 . 05 ) . Oncotarget 1545 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget Figure S1 ) . Analysis of EGFR protein levels and ERK activation over a prolonged time course were quantified by densitometry ( Supplementary Figure S5 ) . Downstream of the EGFR signaling pathway includes the Ras / Raf / mitogen - activated protein kinase pathway , Phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase / Akt pathway , Src kinase pathway , and Signal transducers and activators of the transcription pathway [ 21 , 22 ] . We used a CST EGFR PathScan array to explore the possible molecular mechanisms involved in the proliferative effect of CTTN in CRC cells . We stimulated the cell lysate from the SW1116 sh - CTTN and control cells with 10 ng / mL of EGF for 30 minutes , and found that the phosphorylation levels of ERK and PLCγ1 Ser1248 decreased in the CTTN - sh group ( Supplementary Figure S2 ) . We further confirmed that knockdown of CTTN in HT29 and SW1116 inhibited ERK phosphorylation ( Figure 5A ) , and the rescue expression of CTTN restored ERK phosphorylation after cells were stimulated with 10 ng / mL EGF for 30 minutes . Similarly , CTTN overexpression in SW480 increased ERK phosphorylation ( Figure 5B ) . We also inhibited the ERK1 / 2 pathway by U0126 , a specific ERK1 / 2 inhibitor . The CTTN - overexpressing cells of SW1116 and SW480 were cultured in medium containing U0126 for the indicated time . Tumor cells treated with U0126 had a lower level of p - ERK compared with the control group ( Supplementary Figure S3A ) , and they proliferated at a slower rate and formed less colonies ( Supplementary Figure S3B , S3C ) . This suggests that the MAPK signaling pathway is partially responsible for CTTN - induced cell proliferation . These data suggest CTTN promotes CRC cell proliferation by increasing ERK phosphorylation and activation of the MAPK pathway . To explore the mechanisms of EGFR protein level changes under CTTN depletion , we first used qPCR analysis to assess EGFR mRNA synthesis following Figure 4 : Knockdown of CTTN inhibits CRC cell growth in vivo .

Oncotarget 1546 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget CTTN knockdown . We found that inhibition or rescue expression of CTTN did not interfere with EGFR mRNA levels ( Figure 5C ) . This finding suggests that CTTN may regulate EGFR expression at a posttranslational level . Next we determined the effect of CTTN on EGF - induced EGFR down - regulation in CRC cells . Cells were stimulated with 10 ng / mL EGF after starvation for 16 hours . To block protein synthesis , the cells were pretreated with cycloheximide for one hour . The cells were harvested at different time points for further immunoblotting analyses . The experimental results indicate the knockdown of CTTN reduces the protein level of EGFR .

C . mRNA analysis of EGFR after CTTN knockdown or rescue expression in SW1116 cells ( n = 3 ; Student t test , * P < 0 . 05 , * * P < 0 . 01 ) . D , E . Ligand - induced down - regulation of EGFR was increased in CTTN - depleted cells . Serum - starved control or CTTN - sh CRC cells were pretreated with10 μM of cycloheximide for 1 h , followed by stimulation with 10 ng / mL EGF for the indicated time . F . Ligand - induced down - regulation of EGFR was compromised in SW480 cells with overexpressed CTTN . Similar results were obtained in three different experiments . Oncotarget 1547 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget regulation of EGFR was rapid , with only about 10 % of the receptor remaining after 60 minutes in the CTTN - sh group of HT - 29 and SW1116 compared with base level ( Figure 5D , 5E ) . EGFR down - regulation was slower in SW480 cells , with about 60 % of the EGFR remaining after 60 minutes ( Figure 5F ) . CTTN expression maintained EGF - induced ERK activation . Because we blocked the protein synthesis in the beginning of the experiments , these results suggest that CTTN may increase EGFR degradation induced by EGF . In CRC cells , CTTN expression attenuates EGF - induced down - regulation of EGFR . EGF potentiates proliferative effect of CTTN in CRC cells To further confirm whether the enhanced proliferative effect of CTTN was associated with EGFR protein levels , we used 10 ng / mL EGF to stimulate the CRC cells . The HT - 29 , SW1116 CTTN - sh , and control cells were cultured in the medium containing 1 % FBS and 10 ng / mL EGF , and the relative amount of cells was measured by CCK - 8 assays . The numbers of cells in the sh - Scramble groups are higher than the corresponding sh - CTTN group ( Figure 6A , 6B ) . The up - regulation of CTTN enhances the growth of cells maintained in 1 % FBS with 10 ng / mL EGF ( Figure 6E , 6F ) . CTTN expression can promote colony formation under EGF - dependent conditions ( Figure 6C , 6D , 6F , 6H ) . This potentiation effect of EGF indirectly suggests that CTTN may be involved in the EGFR signaling pathway which promotes CRC cell proliferation . CTTN overexpression attenuates EGF - induced EGFR ubiquitination and down - regulation We examined the effect of CTTN depletion on EGFR ubiquitination and tyrosine phosphorylation induced by EGF . Serum starved control cells , CTTN depleted or rescue expression ( CTTN - sh182 + CTTN ) cells were stimulated with 10 ng / mL of EGF . Cell lysates of each group at different time points were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti - EGFR antibody followed by immunoblotting with either anti - pTyr ( totally ) , anti - pTyr ( 1045 ) , anti - c - Cbl , or anti - ubiquitin antibodies . Upon EGF treatment , there is an overall increase in ubiquitination of EGFR in CTTN depleted cells compared with the WT group ( Figure 7A ) . The rescue expression of CTTN also suppresses the ubiquitination of EGFR . These results indicate that CTTN expression inhibits EGFR ubiquitination induced by EGF . Given the well - known role of c - Cbl in EGFR internalization and ubiquitination [ 23 ] , we investigated whether c - Cbl is altered in CTTN - overexpressed cells stimulated with EGF . The results showed that CTTN knockdown increased binding of c - Cbl with EGFR , and rescue expression may interfere with this coupling ( Figure 7A ) . There were no differences in the levels of totally tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR or EGFR pTyr ( 1045 ) , which is involved in c - Cbl recruitment [ 24 ] . These data imply that CTTN may interfere in the association of EGFR with c - Cbl , and inhibits the ubiquitin - mediated degradation of EGFR . To understand the relationship between CTTN and c - Cbl , we examined whether CTTN can interact with c - Cbl . Immunoblotting of the anti - CTTN immunoprecipitates from SW1116 cell lysates revealed that c - Cbl co - immunoprecipitated with CTTN and EGFR ( Figure 7B ) . After the cell lysates from SW1116 CTTN rescue - expression cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti - HA , we analyzed the binding of c - Cbl , EGFR with CTTN . We found that HA - CTTN can interact with c - Cbl , but EGFR was minimally detected ( Figure 7C ) . In addition , we investigated whether the suppression of ubiquitin - mediated EGFR degradation by CTNN could be blocked by treating cells with lysosomal inhibitor Bafilomycin A1 ( BAF - 1 ) . SW1116 sh - 182 cells treated with Baf - A1 suppressed the knockdown of CTTN - induced degradation of EGFR , as well as EGF - induced phosphorylation of ERK ( Figure 7D ) . Attenuation of MAPK signaling may account for ubiquitin - dependent lysosomal degradation of EGFR . These results indicate that CTTN suppresses the coupling of EGFR with c - Cbl ( and thereby EGFR ubiquitination ) , inhibits the ligand - bound EGFR for lysosomal degradation , and enhances the MAPK signaling pathway by inhibiting the association with c - Cbl . DISCUSSION Colorectal tumorigenesis is a multi - step process resulting from the accumulation of genic mutations and incontrollable regulation of signaling pathways [ 25 – 28 ] . The CTTN gene is amplified in many tumors including head and neck cancer , gastric cancer , and hepatocellular cancer [ 11 , 29 – 40 ] . CTTN was initially found as a substrate of v - Src in chicken cells [ 41 , 42 ] . Subsequently , researchers established that CTTN is an F - actin binding protein that stimulates the migration and metastasis of tumor cells [ 43 ] . Our previous study also found that CTTN is overexpressed in colorectal cancer , and correlated with metastasis of colorectal cancer [ 44 ] . Here , our study further established CTTN promotes the proliferation of CRC cells in vitro and in vivo , and increases the MAPK signaling pathway by attenuation of EGF - induced EGFR down - regulation . In addition to the well described role of CTTN in cellular motility and the formation of invasive pseudopodia [ 45 ] , the proliferation effect in tumors is rarely reported . Via CCK - 8 and EdU labeling assays , our laboratory established that CTTN increased CRC cell growth . We also found that CTTN promoted colony formation in plates and soft agar .

CTTN overexpression enhances EGF - induced proliferation and colony formation in SW480 cells . All assays were performed in plates containing 1 % FBS and 10 ng / mL EGF . Representative images from three independent experiments ( * P < 0 . 05 , * * P < 0 . 01 ) . Oncotarget 1549 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget culture medium enhanced the pro - proliferative function of CTTN . The phospho – antibody based proteomics array identified that the activation of ERK may promote CRC cell proliferation with CTTN overexpression . CTTN also inhibits the receptor - induced endocytosis mediated by the SH3 domain [ 46 ] . Timpson et al further demonstrated that CTTN overexpression inhibited the degradation of EGFR and c - MET in HNSCC [ 10 , 11 ] . Our study found that CTTN expression in CRC cells increased EGFR protein levels , and inhibited the association of EGFR with c - Cbl . This in turn suppressed the ubiquitin - mediated degradation of EGFR , and enhanced the MAPK signaling pathway . The association of c - Cbl with EGFR is regulated by both protein - protein interactions and tyrosine phosphorylation . The tyrosine ( Y ) 1045 of EGFR is necessary for the recruitment of c - Cbl [ 24 ] , while the pTyr 1045 was not changed in cells with CTTN overexpression . CTTN bridges the receptor endocytic machinery with components of the actin cytoskeleton . For instance , CTTN binds the dynamin 2 that regulates the fission of endocytic vesicles , and has been found to participate in the endocytosis of receptors such as EGFR [ 47 , 48 ] . Lynch , D . K . found that CD2AP ( Cortactin - CD2 - associated Protein ) , EGFR , and Cortactin co - localized in membrane ruffles induced by EGF . Cortactin links receptor endocytosis to actin polymerization , facilitating the trafficking of internalized EGFR by binding both CD2AP and the Arp2 / 3 complex [ 46 ] . A close relative of CIN85 , CD2AP has been shown to bind both Cbl and the endophilins and thereby regulate EGFR endocytosis [ 49 , 50 ] . These studies imply that CTTN may interact with c - Cbl indirectly by CD2AP . The results of our CoIP experiments demonstrate CTTN can interact with c - Cbl . Other studies revealed that CTTN is not associated with EGFR levels , and did not have an effect on the proliferation of breast or hepatocellular cancer cells [ 19 , 51 , 52 ] . This observation may be due to the cellular specificity and mutations of the EGFR signaling pathway . Figure 7 : CTTN attenuates EGF - induced EGFR ubiquitination by interaction with c - Cbl . A . SW1116 cells were pretreated with 10 μM of cycloheximide for 1 h followed by stimulation with 10 ng / mL EGF at the indicated time . The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with EGFR and followed with anti - Ubiquitin , EGFR ( Tyr ) , EGFR ( Tyr 1045 ) , c - Cbl and EGFR . B . SW1116 cells were cultured conventionally with 10 % FBS , cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with CTTN , and then immunobloted with anti - EGFR , c - Cbl and CTTN . C . The SW1116 - sh182 cells with CTTN rescue expression were lysed and immunoprecipitated with HA , and then immunobloted with anti - EGFR , c - Cbl . D . Serum starved SW1116 control or CTTN - sh182 cells were pretreated with 10 μM of cycloheximide and 100 μM Bafilomycin A1 ( Baf - A1 ) for 1 h , followed by stimulation with 10 ng / mL EGF at different times . Cell lysates were analyzed with antibodies as indicated by Western Blot . Oncotarget 1550 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget With the emergence of EGFR mAb resistance , a combination of therapeutic targets should be considered [ 22 ] . Our study found CTTN could promote the proliferation and enhance clonogenic ability of colorectal cancer cells . Overexpression of CTTN suppresses the ubiquitin - mediated EGFR degradation that is induced with EGF , leading to sustained MAPK signaling by inhibiting the association between EGFR and c - Cbl . MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell lines and culture Human colorectal cancer cell lines including LoVo , Caco - 2 , HT - 29 , HCT 116 , SW480 , SW620 , SW1116 and Human kidney 293T cell were obtained from ATCC ( Manassas , VA , USA ) . LoVo was maintained with F12K medium ( SIGMA , USA ) ; HT - 29 and HCT 116 were maintained with McCoy’s 5A ( SIGMA , USA ) ; SW480 , SW620 , and SW1116 were cultured in Leibovitz’ L - 15 ( GIBCO , USA ) with 10 % FBS ( GIBCO , USA ) ; Caco - 2 was cultured in MEM ( GIBCO , USA ) with 20 % FBS ( GIBCO , USA ) ; 293T was maintained in DMEM ( GIBCO , USA ) with 10 % FBS ( GIBCO , USA ) . The SW480 , SW620 , and SW1116 were incubated at 37°C without CO 2 ; the other cells were cultured in 37°C with 5 % CO 2 . Reagents , RNAi , plasmids , package and infection The siRNA products were designed and purchased from Gene Pharma ( Shanghai , China ) ( Supplementary information , Table S1 ) . We used an siRNA pool containing two different siRNA to suppress the expression of CTTN . The efficiency was assayed by qRT - PCR and western blot ( WB ) . We designed one lentiviral shRNA plasmid containing two different target sites of the CTTN - CDS domain ( CTTN - sh 273 , CTTN - sh 275 ) , and another sh 182 plasmid to target the 3’UTR of CTTN ( Supplementary information , Table S1 ) . The efficiency of each siRNA and shRNA was evaluated by qRT - PCR and WB . The commercial lentiviral ORF plasmid of CTTN ( Isoform A , the longest ORF of CTTN ) was bought from GeneCopia ( USA ) . The creation of Lentivirus stocks carrying CTTN - ORF or shRNA targeting CTTN followed the instructions provided by Addgene ( USA ) . For transient transfection , cells were seeded into 6 - well plates and transfected with siRNA or siRNA pool using lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen , USA ) , performed per the manufacturer’s instructions . The stable cells were obtained by using the virus particles with 10 ~ 50 MOI ( multiplicity of infection ) to infect the cell lines , then transfected cells were selected by FACS ( Fluorescence activated Cell Sorting ) , or by culturing with 5 μg / mL of puromycin for about one week . Cell proliferation assay The growth of cells was measured with CCK - 8 ( Cell Counting Kit - 8 , Dojindo , Kumamoto , Japan ) . Cells were plated in 96 - well culture plates ( 1 . 0 ~ 3 . 0×10 3 / well ) , and incubated for 5 to 6 days at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 5 % CO 2 . Every 24h , the number of viable cells was quantified by adding 10 μL CCK - 8 to each pore , and then incubated for another 2h . The absorbance of each pore at 450 nm was measured using a microplate reader . The EdU incorporation assay was used to examine cell proliferation with the Cell - Light™ EdU DNA Cell Proliferation Kit ( Guangzhou Ribobio Co . , Ltd , Guangzhou , China ) , and performed per the manufacturer’s instructions . The percentage of positive cells labelled with EdU was calculated from five random fields . Colony formation assay The cell suspension was prepared and plated in 6 - well plates at a density of 250 ~ 1000 cells / well , with or without 10 ng / mL EGF , and incubated for 2 - 3 weeks . When the colonies formed after about 6 passages , the cells were then fixed with methanol containing 1 % crystal violet for 15 minutes . Then the plates were washed to get rid of the remaining crystal violet , and allowed to dry . We performed the soft agarose clonogenic assay to test the anchorage - independent growth of cells at different conditions . Agar ( A9045 - 25G , SIGMA ) at 0 . 6 % and 1 . 2 % in deionized water was autoclaved , and then stored in a 40°C water bath until use . Equal volumes of the two different concentrations of agar solution and 2X RMPI , F12K , or L - 15 medium containing 20 % FBS were mixed thoroughly , and kept at 40°C . Then 2 ml diluted 0 . 6 % agar medium was added to 6 - well plates , and allowed to cool at room temperature for about 30 minutes . Cells were trypsinized , counted , and resuspended in the diluted 0 . 3 % agar media , then pipetted to the bottom layer in each well immediately . The upper layer became solidified after 30 minutes at 4°C . Every 7 days for 3 - 6 weeks , 1 mL of culture medium containing 10 μg / mL EGF and 1 % FBS was applied to the well . After colonies were visible , plates were removed , 500 μL of 5 mg / mL MTT was added , then incubated for 2 hours at 37°C . Images were captured with a digital single lens reflex camera ( Nikon , JP ) . Protein extraction , western blot analysis The cells were stimulated with 10 ng / mL EGF ( Peprotech , USA ) after 16 hours of serum starvation , and 1 hour of incubation with 10 μM of cycloheximide . The cells were lysed with RIPA ( R0010 , Solarbio ) , containing phosphatase inhibitor cocktail ( Roche , Swiss Confederation ) . The protein concentration was measured by BCA assay ( Thermo Scientific , USA ) . The cell lysates Oncotarget 1551 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget were analyzed by SDS - PAGE , transferred to PVDF membranes ( Millipore Corp . , USA ) , and then blocked with 1 % BSA ( Thermo Scientific , USA ) . The membranes were incubated with primary antibodies including Cortactin ( sc - 11408 , SANTA CRUZ ) , EGFR ( D38B1 , CST ) , Phospho - p44 / 42 MAPK ( Erk1 / 2 , Thr202 / Tyr204 , CST ) , p44 / 42 MAPK ( Erk1 / 2 , CST ) , and GAPDH ( sc - 32233 , SANTA CRUZ ) with anti - mouse or anti - rabbit HRP secondary antibody ( SANTA CRUZ , USA ) . The target bands were visualized by chemiluminescence ( Millipore Corp . , USA ) . Clinical specimens , RNA extraction , and qRT - PCR Colorectal cancer and the adjacent non - tumor tissues ( at least 5 cm away from the tumor site ) were obtained from surgical specimens approved by the Ethical Committee of Ruijin Hospital , Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine . The participants were provided written informed consent to take part in this clinical study . The surgical specimens were excised immediately after cancer samples’ dissection , and preserved in liquid nitrogen . The pathologic staging of the tumors was performed according to the Cancer Staging Manual from the International Union Against Cancer ( 7th edition , 2010 ) . Tumor specimens were classified into two groups based on the relative expression of CTTN / GAPDH examined by qRT - PCR . Total RNA was extracted from both cell lines and tumor tissues with Trizol reagent ( Invitrogen , USA ) , performed per the manufacturer’s instruction , and then reverse transcribed to cDNA . The cDNA was subjected to a qPCR assay for further analysis of CTTN mRNA levels . Primer sequences are in the supplementary information ( Table S2 ) . Xenograft nude mouse assay , Immunohistochemistry Animal studies were performed as previously described [ 55 ] . For in vivo tumor growth assay , the stable transfected cells of SW1116 CTTN - sh 273 / 275 ( also named CTTN - sh ) were implanted subcutaneously to the left upper flank region of the male mice ( 1 × 10 6 cells per mouse ) . The tumor size was measured weekly using calipers as follows : tumor volume ( mm 3 ) = ( L×W 2 ) / 2 , where L represents length , and W represents width . About six weeks later , the tumors were excised and processed for standard histological studies after the mice were euthanized . The animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Shanghai Jiao Tong University . All animal studies were performed according to the guidelines on the care and use of animals for scientific use . For histological analysis , the tumors of patients and nude mice were fixed in 10 % formalin for at least 24 hours , and then were embedded with paraffin . The sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin ( H & E ) for the morphological analysis , or with specific primary antibody of CTTN , Ki - 67 ( Santa Cruz , USA ) . The slides were stained with the 2 - Solution DAB Kit ( Invitrogen , USA ) , following the manufacturer’s instructions . Based on the staining intensity of the tumor cells , staining levels were classified as negative ( no or weak staining ) or positive ( moderate or strong staining ) . We examined 61 pairs of colorectal cancer tissue by IHC and qRT - PCR . Two pathologists , who were blinded from any patient data , independently examined the cellular location of CTTN and compared the staining between the tumor and normal tissues for each case . Immunohistochemistry stain score = positive cell score + staining intensity score [ 53 ] . The percentage of positive cells was classified by five grades ( percentage scores ) : < 10 % ( grade 0 ) , 10 - 25 % ( grade 1 ) , > 25 - 50 % ( grade 2 ) , > 50 - 75 % ( grade 3 ) , and > 75 % ( grade 4 ) . Immunohistochemical staining intensity was graded as follows : 0 ( no staining ) , 1 ( bright yellow ) , 2 ( orange ) , or 3 ( brown ) . The total scores of ≤2 , > 2 - 5 , and ≥6 were defined as negative , weak positive , and strong positive , respectively . EGFR PathScan array analysis The PathScan® EGFR signaling antibody array kit ( Cell Signaling Technology , USA ) was used to analyze the phosphorylated molecules influenced by loss of CTTN function in the EGFR signaling pathway . This experiment was performed per procedures provided by the manufacturer . Grayscale images were further analyzed with image J . Statistical analysis Data from this study is expressed as mean ± S . D . of three independent experiments , unless specified otherwise , and were evaluated with an unpaired Student’s t test ( two - tailed ; P < 0 . 05 was considered significant ) . The CTTN mRNA expression differences between colorectal tumors and paired normal tissues were analyzed with paired Student’s t - test . The χ2 test was performed to evaluate the association between the clinicopathological parameters of the CRC specimens and CTTN levels . In all statistical analyses , P values < 0 . 05 were considered significant . ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We are grateful to Yang Linsen , PhD for providing the pLVX - shRNA1 Vector .
