The metabolic reactions were compartmentalized between the cytosol and the mitochondria , and transport steps between the compartments and the environment were included . A total of 708 structural open reading frames ( ORFs ) were accounted for in the reconstructed network , corresponding to 1035 metabolic reactions . Further , 140 reactions were included on the basis of biochemical evidence resulting in a genome - scale reconstructed metabolic network containing 1175 metabolic reactions and 584 metabolites . The number of gene functions included in the reconstructed network corresponds to ∼ 16 % of all characterized ORFs in S . cerevisiae . Using the reconstructed network , the metabolic capabilities of S . cerevisiae were calculated and compared with Escherichia coli . The reconstructed metabolic network is the first comprehensive network for a eukaryotic organism , and it may be used as the basis for in silico analysis of phenotypic functions .

( Goffeau 1997 ) . Along with its industrial im - portance , S . cerevisiae serves as a model organism for under - standing and engineering eukaryotic cell function ( Dujon 1996 ; Botstein et al . 1997 ) . There have been many studies aiming to unravel the function of orphan genes in the ge - nome ( Oliver 1998 ; Entian et al . 1999 ; Winzeler et al . 1999 ; Hughes et al . 2000 ) , and various functional genomics tech - niques were first implemented in S . cerevisiae . The first ge - nome - wide cDNA array study was designed for S . cerevisiae ( DeRisi et al . 1997 ) , which subsequently resulted in a large number of studies on expression profiling ( Hughes et al . 2000 ) . Large - scale studies have been conducted to investigate the protein – protein interactions ( Uetz et al . 2000 ) , including the use of two - hybrid systems ( Ito et al . 2001 ) . These studies and a large body of biochemical literature now enable us to functionally integrate the wealth of available genetic , molecu - lar , and biochemical information for S . cerevisiae . Integration of knowledge at different levels in the cas - cade from genes to protein and further to metabolic fluxes in a genome - scale network will be pivotal for understanding how the individual components in the system interact and influence overall cell function . The approach of analyzing a complex process at different levels was illustrated in a recent study in which expression profiles in different mutants were compared with protein levels in order to unravel the structure of the complex galactose ( GAL ) – regulon ( Ideker et al . 2001 ) . This coordinated and multilevel effort may have significant influence on designing metabolic engineering strategies ( Østergaard et al . 2000a , b ) . These interactions must now be quantified through the use of a mathematical framework— something that involves a significant research effort , but which is believed to lead to fundamental new insights into cellular function ( Schilling et al . 1999 ; Endy and Brent 2001 ) . To gain insight into cell synthesis and the metabolic capabil - ity through mathematical modeling , a natural first step is to reconstruct the underlying metabolic network , as this is re - sponsible for the synthesis capacity of the cell , and , as well , it allows detailed analysis of the interactions between the indi - vidual pathways functioning in the cell . Recently , genome - scale metabolic networks were reconstructed for prokaryotic cells ( Edwards and Palsson 1999 ; Covert et al . 2001 ) , and it was demonstrated how such reconstructed metabolic models allow direct correlation between the genomic information and metabolic activity at the flux level . In these reconstructed metabolic networks , which consist of several hundred reac - tions and several hundred metabolites , it was possible to simulate the phenotypic behavior under different genetic conditions and physiological environments ( Edwards et al . 2001 ) . Here , we present the reconstruction of the metabolic net - work of S . cerevisiae , the first genome - scale in silico metabolic network for a eukaryotic cell .

The structure and metabolic capabili - ties of the metabolic network of S . cerevisiae were compared with a genome - scale reconstructed metabolic network of Esch - erichia coli ( Edwards and Palsson 2000 ) . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Genome - Scale Metabolic Reconstruction A genome - scale reconstruction of a metabolic network is cur - rently a nonautomated and iterative decision - making process that can easily require up to one man - year to assemble a sat - isfying reaction list specifically collected for one organism . Once a metabolic network is reconstructed , mathematical methods , such as convex analysis and linear programming , can be applied to analyze structural properties , such as con - nectivity , etc . , and simulation of cellular behavior under dif - ferent genetic and physiological conditions can be conducted . For example , results may be used for the development of metabolic engineering strategies for the construction of strains with desired and improved properties . The present work focuses on the reconstruction of the metabolic network of the yeast S . cerevisiae . Some structural properties of the net - work and capabilities for biomass precursor and amino acid production by the network were evaluated . During the reconstruction process , a number of decisions on each reaction needed to be taken ( Fig . 1 ) . Is an enzyme present in the organism ? Which reaction catalyzes the en - zyme , and what is the stoichiometry of that reaction ? If co - factors are involved , is the reaction , for example , reduced nicotinamide - adenine dinucleotide ( NADH ) or reduced nico - tinamide - adenine dinucleotide phosphate ( NADPH ) depen - dent , or can the enzyme use both cofactors ? Is the reaction reversible or irreversible ? Where is the reaction localized ? Fur - thermore , for modeling purposes , information on the bio - mass composition , and on growth and nongrowth - dependent adenosine - 5 (cid:1) - diphosphate ( ATP ) requirements has to be avail - able . Once the metabolic pathways have been reconstructed or a complete and satisfying reaction list is available , the model can be used to simulate metabolic behavior . However , before it can be applied , the validity of the reaction list for modeling purposes has to be tested . For model validation , we compared computed results of anaerobic and aerobic chemo - stat cultivation at a dilution rate of 0 . 1 h (cid:2) 1 to experimental results from Nissen et al . ( 1997 ) and Overkamp et al . ( 2000 ) ( data not shown ) . A genome - scale reconstruction is based on a thorough literature examination in order to extract the current state of the art on known metabolic reactions . Here , online pathway Figure 1 Reconstruction of the metabolic network of S . cerevisiae . Based on the available information from the genome annotation , biochemical pathway databases , biochemistry textbooks , and recent publications , a genome - scale metabolic network of S . cerevisiae was designed . Additional physiological constraints were considered and modeled , such as growth and nongrowth - dependent ATP requirements . Compartmentation was included , and cofactor requirements of all model reactions were inspected carefully , thereby , reactions that created a net transhydrogenic effect were additionally constrained . Regulatory information was not included . The picture of the pathway map was taken from the KEGG database ( www . genome . ad . jp ) . Genome - Scale Reconstruction of S . cerevisiae Genome Research 245 www . genome . org databases , biochemistry textbooks , and the annotated ge - nome sequence have to be consulted , and , especially , extrac - tion of information on metabolic reactions from journal pub - lications is essential . In detail , the reconstruction process for S . cerevisiae was initiated by downloading a gene catalog from the KEGG metabolic pathways database ( http : / / kegg . genome . ad . jp / dbget - bin / get _ htext ? S . cerevisiae . kegg + - f + T + w + C ) . The infor - mation contained in this gene catalog is organized into tra - ditional pathways , such as glycolysis , pentose phosphate pathway , any amino acid biosynthetic pathway , etc . , and was used throughout the reconstruction process . Details are pre - sented for the ORF name , gene name , enzyme name , EC num - ber ( if available ) , and SWISS - PROT entry name , and the KEGG metabolic chart may be used to reconstruct specifically the metabolic network for S . cerevisiae . The information on EC numbers was used to search for the stoichiometry of the re - actions using the Enzyme nomenclature database ( http : / / www . expasy . ch / enzyme / ) . To create a comprehensive reac - tion list , the present information in the reconstructed net - work was checked for whether genes were missing using the MIPS Comprehensive Yeast Genome Database ( CYGD ) ( http : / / mips . gsf . de / proj / yeast / ) and Saccharomyces Genome Database ( SGD ) ( http : / / genome - www . stanford . edu / Saccharomyces / ) . The stoichiometry of a reaction in the En - zyme nomenclature database and also in many pathway da - tabases is often presented in a general form , such as , for ex - ample , for NADH - dependent alcohol dehydrogenase , as alcohol dehydrogenases generally accept a wide range of dif - ferent aldehydes or alcohols as substrate . Hence , the stoichi - ometry is found as follows : An aldehyde + NADH < (cid:2) > An alcohol + NAD _ upper ( + ) . For reconstruction and modeling purposes , this information is insufficient , and through an ad - ditional database and literature search , the S . cerevisiae - specific substrates and products were identified , here , acetal - dehyde and ethanol . Also , a large number of reactions involve cofactors utilization , and for many of these reactions , the co - factor requirements have not yet been completely elucidated , for example , whether reactions only require either NADH or NADPH as a cofactor or whether the enzyme can use both cofactors . Some reactions are known to involve both cofac - tors . For example , the mitochondrial aldehyde dehydroge - nase encoded by ALD4 may use both NADH and NADPH as a cofactor ( Remize et al . 2000 ) . In such cases , two reactions were included in the reconstructed metabolic network . Concerning localization , all reactions were localized into the two main compartments , cytosol and mitochondria , as most of the common metabolic reactions in S . cerevisiae take place in these compartments . Reactions located in vivo in other compartments , or reactions for which no information is presently available on the localization , were assumed to be cytosolic . Information on localization was mainly extracted from CYGD and YPD . All corresponding metabolites were as - signed appropriate localization , and a link between cytosol and mitochondria was established through either known transport and shuttle systems or through inferred reactions to meet metabolic demands . To differentiate metabolites in the mitochondria and cytosol , metabolites that were located in the mitochondria for a specific reaction end with a small m ( see Web links ) . Whether reactions are irreversible or reversible was ex - tracted from pathway databases and additional literature ( see Methods ) . When no information was available , reactions were initially defined to be reversible . For enzyme complexes such as succinate dehydrogenase , fatty acid synthase , and complexes of the electronic transport chain , a single reaction for the corresponding genes was de - fined . Further considerations were taken into account to pre - serve some unique features of the S . cerevisiae metabolism . S . cerevisiae lacks a gene that encodes the enzyme transhydroge - nase . Insertion of a corresponding gene from Azetobacter vine - landii in S . cerevisiae has a major impact on its phenotypic behavior , especially under anaerobic conditions ( Nissen et al . 2001 ) . As a result , reactions that create a net transhydrogenic effect in the model were either constrained to zero or forced to become irreversible . For instance , the flux carried by NADH - dependent glutamate dehydrogenase ( Gdh2p ) was con - strained to zero to avoid the appearance of a net transhy - drogenase activity through coupling with the NADPH - dependent glutamate dehydrogenases ( Gdh1p and Gdh3p ) . Decisions also needed to be made as to whether a reac - tion should be present in the reconstructed metabolic model , although no corresponding confirmed gene function is avail - able . Many reactions have shown experimentally that they must be present in S . cerevisiae or they must simply be present to allow the formation of biomass . A typical example for the former case is the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway , which is the main supplier of cytosolic NADPH . It is not currently known whether the second step in the pentose phosphate is driven nonenzymatically or enzymatically by 6 - phosphogluconolactonase . Because the oxidative pathway has to be active in S . cerevisiae and because the S . cerevisiae genome contains at least four possible sites for a 6 - phospho - gluconolactonase ( SOL1 , SOL2 , SOL3 , SOL4 ) , the correspond - ing reactions were included in the model . The reconstruction process led to a set of biochemical reactions that might be used in constructing stoichiometric models of metabolism using metabolite balancing ( Stepha - nopoulos et al . 1998 ; Edwards et al . 1999 ; Gombert and Nielsen 2000 ) . These models simply rely on mass balances around metabolic intermediates and allow simulation of steady state behavior , without inclusion of information on regulatory and dynamics information . Further to the infor - mation obtained on the stoichiometry , localization , and re - versibility of the reactions as described before , knowledge on the biomass composition needed to be computed as a drain of precursors or building blocks into biomass . Table 1 shows the biomass composition that was considered in the stoichiomet - ric model and details on the calculation can be found at the mentioned Internet links . Even though the biomass compo - sition changes under different physiological conditions , it may be assumed constant , as it has been demonstrated that a change in biomass composition merely changes the simula - tion results ( Varma et al . 1993 ) . Furthermore , information on the growth - associated ATP requirements ( Stouthamer 1979 ) ( maintenance of membrane potentials , turn - over of macro - molecules , etc . ) and on the ATP cost that is required for the polymerization of amino acids and nucleotides needed to be available . The polymerization cost was calculated by Verduyn et al . ( 1991 ) to be 23 . 92 mmole ATP / g DW , and the growth - associated ATP maintenance was found by fitting the recon - structed model to the experimentally determined biomass yield of 0 . 51 g DW / g glucose ( Verduyn 1991 ) . Hereby , this contribution was estimated to be 35 . 36 mmole ATP / g DW . Thus , the sum of these two contributions is 59 . 28 mmole ATP / g DW , which was included in the stoichiometric model Fo¨rster et al . 246 Genome Research www . genome . org of S . cerevisiae . The ATP costs for the synthesis of building blocks , which could be derived directly from the model , was found to be 9 . 89 mmole ATP / g DW and , thus , the total ATP requirement for biomass growth was estimated to be 69 . 2 mmole ATP / g DW , which falls into the range of experimen - tally measured values ( Verduyn et al . 1990 ; Verduyn 1991 ) . Finally , a nongrowth - associated ATP requirement of 1 mmole / g DW / h was assumed to be required ( Stouthamer 1979 ; Verduyn et al . 1990 ) . At this step , a first model was designed that could be applied to linear programming to simulate cellular behavior . The model was used to minimize the glucose uptake rate at a dilution rate of 0 . 1 h (cid:2) 1 for aerobic and anaerobic conditions , and results were compared with experimental results ( data not shown ) . Initially , no agreement between computed and experimental results could be found . However , through a rig - orous investigation of flux distributions and shadow price analyses , it was possible to adjust and correct the initial reac - tion list until simulated results were in agreement for both cases . At this step , the reconstruction process was considered to be finished . Characteristics of the Reconstructed Network The metabolic reconstruction process resulted in a network that consisted of 1175 metabolic reactions and 584 metabo - lites ( Table 2 ) . A total of 708 metabolic ORFs were included in the reconstructed network , to which 1035 reactions were as - signed . Some 595 metabolic ORFs contained at least one en - zyme commission ( EC ) number . This corresponded to ∼ 54 % of all ORFs that were assigned an EC number in the MIPS database ( 595 of 1098 ORFs ; Mewes et al . 1997 ) . The remain - ing 46 % correspond mainly to protein kinases , protein phos - phates , peptidases , and proteases , which have not been in - cluded . Most of the enzymes are monofunctional , with 179 enzymes being multifunctional . Currently , the number of protein - coding genes in the S . cerevisiae genome is estimated by YPD ( Costanzo et al . 2001 ) to be 6281 , of which 4127 corresponding proteins were characterized by genetics or bio - chemistry , and an additional 252 proteins were assigned func - tions by homology searches . The total number of genes in - cluded in the reconstructed metabolic network corresponded to ∼ 16 % of all characterized ORFs . On the basis of the protein complex catalog of MIPS ( Mewes et al . 1997 ) , 26 protein complexes , which catalyzed 88 reactions , were identified in the reconstructed metabolic network . The metabolic network contained 193 ORFs coding for isoenzymes , which catalyzed 239 reactions . A total of 140 reactions were included on the basis of biochemical evidence or physiological considerations , but currently with no annotated ORF . More than 85 % of these Table 2 .

Genome - Scale Reconstruction of S . cerevisiae Genome Research 247 www . genome . org reactions were transport reactions over the cytoplasmic or mi - tochondrial membrane , other reactions were mainly involved in amino acid , nucleotide , and vitamin metabolism ( Table 3 ) . A total of 349 transport reactions were included in the model , of which 287 were involved in transporting metabolites in or out of the cell , and 62 transport reactions were involved in interchanging metabolites between the cytosol and the mito - chondria . Reversibility and irreversibility of reactions was carefully accounted for in the reconstruction process , so that approximately two - thirds of the reactions were assumed to be irreversible . A complete list of all included reactions can be down - loaded at http : / / www . cpb . dtu . dk / models / yeastmodel . html or http : / / gcrg / organisms / yeast . html . The most frequently used metabolic intermediates in the reconstructed network are presented in Table 4 , showing that the most connected metabolites were involved in energy me - tabolism , such as ATP , etc . , in redox metabolism , such as NADPH , and in nitrogen metabolism , such as glutamine and glutamate . The most frequently used metabolite was proton , due to its participation in a high number of proton - coupled transport reactions in the network . The number of reactions involving proton was much higher than in metabolic net - works of prokaryotic microorganism reconstructed previously ( Schilling 2000 ) . This difference was mainly due to the larger number of proton - driven transport systems in S . cerevisiae — both in the cytosolic and in the mitochondrial membrane . For comparison , the metabolic connectivity of three prokary - otic organisms was examined ( Table 4 ) . In all 4 reconstructed networks , the 12 most connected metabolites represented the key intermediates of high - energy metabolism , redox carriers , nitrogen metabolism , and 2 - and 3 - carbon intermediates . An - other important topological property of the reconstructed network was the number of metabolites that participate in each reaction ( Fig . 2 ) . For all four networks , the most com - mon number was 4 , representing the conversion of a substrate to a product concomitant with the conversion of a coupled cofactor from one form to another . Most frequently , this con - version involved ATP and ADP or the translocation of H + . A total of 184 metabolites were not connected to the overall metabolic network , showing that either reactions link - ing these metabolites to the overall metabolic network have not been identified yet , proteins may have been assigned wrong functions in the annotation process , or S . cerevisiae has lost some of its metabolic functions during evolution . This result shows that the information on the metabolic network in S . cerevisiae is currently still incomplete , however , the pre - T a b l e 4 .

An example of an unlinked metabolite was formaldehyde . It appeared only in one reaction in the metabolic network through the inclu - sion of the gene SFA1 , which codes for a formaldehyde dehy - drogenase . It is as yet unknown which role formaldehyde plays in the natural environment of S . cerevisiae . From the observation that S . cerevisiae contains a formaldehyde as well as formate dehydrogenases , it may be concluded that it either encounters these C1 compounds in its natural environment or generates them in its metabolic network ( J . Pronk , pers . comm . ) . The Reconstructed Metabolic Network of S . cerevisiae Versus MIPS Entries and Enzyme Commission Assignments Throughout the reconstruction process , 595 ORFs have been assigned an EC number , corresponding to 850 reactions . The most abundant enzyme class is transferases followed by oxi - doreductases , hydrolases , lyases , ligases , and isomerases ( Fig . 2 . ) A similar tendency was found for a reconstructed meta - bolic network of E . coli ( Edwards and Palsson 2000 ) , but this network contains more lyases than hydrolases . The compari - son of the number of ORFs with the number of reactions in each enzyme category suggests that in S . cerevisiae , isomerases , and transferases are less substrate specific ( ratio of number of reactions to number of ORFs ) than any of the other enzyme classes , whereas in E . coli transferases and hydrolases are the least substrate - specific enzyme classes ( Fig . 3 ) . The number of ORFs included in the metabolic recon - struction of S . cerevisiae was also compared with the func - tional categories as defined by MIPS . Not surprisingly , most of the ORFs fall into two main classes , such as metabolism and energy , followed by the classes of transport facilitation and cellular transport and transport mechanism . Furthermore , for ∼ 430 ORFs , information about localization is available as characterized by the functional category , cellular organiza - tion ( Table 5 ) . The large functional classes of metabolism and energy were investigated in more detail ( Fig . 4 ) . Analyzing the func - tional category metabolism ( Fig . 4A ) revealed that most ORFs are involved in C - compound and carbohydrate metabolism , followed by amino acid metabolism , lipid , fatty acid and iso - prenoid metabolism , and nucleotide metabolism . Compari - son with MIPS entries showed that the number of ORFs in - cluded in the reconstructed network is different from the MIPS database . This difference is either due to exclusion of ORFs , which are involved in regulation , such as ORFs encod - ing activators or negative regulators , or exclusion of ORFs , which have assigned function based on similarity searches . The second largest functional category classified by the MIPS database is that of the lipid , fatty acid , and isopreniod me - tabolism . However , during the metabolic reconstruction pro - cess , more ORFs were included in the functional category , amino - acid metabolism , than in the functional category , lipid , fatty acid , and isoprenoid metabolism , based on a high number of ORFs that have been assigned function using simi - larity searches . This result is consistent with the fact that the amino acid metabolism is currently still better understood than the much more complex lipid metabolism . Details of the functional class energy metabolism are shown in Figure 4B , elucidating the fact that traditional path - ways of the primary metabolism , such as glycolysis , gluconeo - genesis , pentose - phosphate pathway , TCA cycle , and glyox - ylate cycle are very well described .

Genome - Scale Reconstruction of S . cerevisiae Genome Research 249 www . genome . org dition , these categories contain a high number of ORFs that have been assigned function by similarity searches and for many cases , the function has not been fully elucidated . Biosynthesis of Amino Acid and Precursor Metabolites—Metabolic Capabilities of S . cerevisiae All building blocks needed for synthesis of macromolecules constituting cell mass can be generated from a set of 12 pre - cursor metabolites ( Stephanopoulos et al . 1998 ) . The capabil - ity of the reconstructed genome - based S . cerevisiae and E . coli networks to produce these precursor metabolites using glu - cose as the sole carbon source was computed by use of linear optimization ( Fell and Small 1986 ; Varma and Palsson 1993 ) . Similarly , the maximum production of the 20 common amino acids was calculated for both organisms . In both cases , S . cerevisiae was found to be more efficient in producing pre - cursor metabolites and amino acids ( Fig . 5A , B ) . This result is somewhat surprising , as E . coli has been recognized and is widely used as a host for industrial amino acid production . Investigation of the corresponding flux distributions shows that the difference is caused by the higher ATP maintenance requirements in E . coli . If ATP maintenance requirements are not considered , the S . cerevisiae and E . coli networks generate similar systemic yields , except for acetyl - CoA , glutamate , glu - tamine , and glycine . Thus , the analysis shows that S . cerevisiae may be a suitable host for industrial amino acid production . In conclusion , the metabolic network of S . cerevisiae was reconstructed using a procedure based on information from genomic databases , reaction databases , and a comprehensive literature search on S . cerevisiae . Although it is incomplete , given the number of orphan ORFs , it is a first step toward cataloging and characterizing the entire metabolic portfolio of a eukaryotic organism . This conclusion is supported by the myriad of specific and insightful information derived from the list of metabolic reactions . The potential of the recon - structed model may further be used for the analysis of phe - notypic behavior under different genetic and physiological conditions ( I . Famili , J . Fo¨rster , J . Nielsen , and B . Ø . Palsson , in prep . ) The reconstructed metabolic network of S . cerevisiae represents a strong platform for reconstruction of metabolic networks of higher organisms , such as plants , animal , and Figure 4 ORFs sorted into the functional categories of MIPS , me - tabolism ( A ) and energy ( B ) .

Such reconstructed metabolic networks will serve an important role in systems biology , as the analysis of recon - structed metabolic networks will facilitate the exploration of metabolism for drug targets ( Schuster et al . 1999 ) , enable the design of microbial strains with improved characteristics through metabolic engineering ( Nielsen 2001 ) , and serve as a tool in functional annotation ( Selkov et al . 2000 ) . METHODS Metabolic Reconstruction Process The reconstruction process is shown in Figure 1 and is de - scribed in detail in the main text . In brief , the reconstruction process involves the collection of all known enzymatic reac - tions in the metabolic pathways of S . cerevisiae . Tables 6 and 7 contain information on the online genome and pathway da - tabases and key references used for the reconstruction process . Furthermore , journal publications were used to identify spe - cific information on the reactions . Linear Programming The reactions of the reconstructed metabolic model were for - mulated as a stoichiometric model S (cid:1) v = 0 , as , for example , described in Edwards et al . ( 1999 ) or Stephanopoulos et al . ( 1998 ) . This model describes cellular behavior under pseudo steady - state conditions , and S is defined as the stoichiometric matrix that contains the stoichiometric coefficients of inter - nal ( balanced ) metabolite i in the j th reactions and v is the flux vector that corresponds to the flux of the j th reaction . The stoichiometric model was solved using linear programming , an approach often referred to as flux balance analysis ( Ed - wards et al . 1999 ) . The linear programming problem was formulated by de - fining an objective function Z : Minimize Z = a (cid:1) V subject to S (cid:1) v = 0 v i , irr ∈ (cid:1) + v i , rev ∈ (cid:1) , in which a was a row vector containing weights of the indi - vidual variables specifying the influence of the individual fluxes on the objective function Z . The elements of the flux vector v were constrained for the definition of reversible and irreversible reactions , v i , rev and v i , irr , respectively . Uptake was defined for glucose , sulfate , ammonia , phosphate , oxygen ( for aerobic growth ) , and ergosterol and zymosterol ( for anaerobic growth ) . Secretion was defined for all major metabolic prod - ucts , such as ethanol , glycerol , succinate , acetate , pyruvate , and for all amino acid , organic acids ( see supplementary ma - terial ) . The consistency of the model was checked at anaerobic and aerobic conditions at a dilution rate of 0 . 1 h (cid:2) 1 ( objective function Z = µ ) and compared with experimental results from Nissen et al . ( 1997 ) and Overkamp et al . ( 2000 ) , respectively . For the maximization of precursors or building blocks of biomass , an additional reaction was defined in the model and maximized for . The general format of the additional reaction was as follows : precursor → precursorOut , and the objective was the maximization of that particular reaction . All calculations were carried out using the commercially available software Lindo ( Lindo Systems Inc . ) . Shadow Prices Shadow prices are derived from the dual variable of a linear programming problem ( see , for example , Bertsimas and Tsit - siklis 1997 ) . Its’ definition is : (cid:2) i = − dZ db i , in which b i corresponds to a potential uptake or secretion rate of metabolite i . Negative shadow prices describe metabolites Table 6 .

Preliminate versions of the reconstructed models were unable to model cellular behavior ; either the model did not allow growth or growth reached infinity . In such cases , three strategies were considered for identifying the missing or in - correct information in the model during the reconstruction process . First , investigation of the flux distribution , second , investigation of shadow prices , and third , definition of new linear programming problems , such as maximization of pre - cursors or building blocks that are necessary to synthesize biomass .
