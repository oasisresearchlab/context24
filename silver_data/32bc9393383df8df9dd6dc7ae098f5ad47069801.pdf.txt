If the number of dying cells does not match those dividing , the barrier would vanish , or tumors can form . Mechanical forces and the stretch - activated ion channel ( SAC ) Piezo1 link both processes ; stretch promotes cell division and crowding triggers cell death by initiating live cell extrusion 1 , 2 . However , it was not clear how particular cells within a crowded region are selected for extrusion . Here , we show that individual cells transiently shrink via water loss before they extrude . Artificially inducing cell shrinkage by increasing extracellular osmolarity is suffi - cient to induce cell extrusion . Pre - extrusion cell shrinkage requires the voltage - gated potassium channels Kv1 . 1 and Kv1 . 2 and the chloride channel SWELL1 , upstream of Piezo1 . Activation of these voltage - gated channels requires the mechano - sensitive Epithelial Sodium Channel , ENaC , acting as the earliest crowd - sensing step . Imaging with a voltage dye indicated that epithelial cells lose membrane potential as they become crowded and smaller , yet those selected for extrusion are markedly more depolarized than their neighbours . Loss of any of these channels in crowded conditions causes epithelial buckling , highlighting an important role for voltage and water regulation in controlling epithelial shape as well as extrusion . Thus , ENaC causes cells with similar mem - brane potentials to slowly shrink with compression but those with reduced membrane potentials to be eliminated by extrusion , suggesting a chief driver of cell death stems from insufficient energy to maintain cell membrane potential . MAIN : Cell extrusion promotes cell death to maintain homeostatic epithelial cell numbers , using a mechanism con - served from sea sponge to humans . During extrusion , a live cell is ejected apically by coordinated basolateral actomyosin contraction of the extruding cell and its neighbors 1 . After extrusion , the cell dies due to lack of sur - vival signaling . We previously discovered that Piezo1 activates live cell extrusion ( LCE ) in response to crowding to maintain constant epithelial cell numbers 1 , 2 . Crowding activation of Piezo1 triggers a canonical pathway that also extrudes cells triggered to die by apoptosis . To extrude , cells produce the lipid Sphingosine 1 - Phosphate ( S1P ) , which binds the G - protein - coupled receptor S1P 2 to activate Rho - mediated actomyosin contraction need - ed for extrusion 2 - 4 . As crowding - induced cell extrusion drives most epithelia cell death , an important outstanding question is which cells within a crowded epithelial field are chosen for extrusion ? In sparse epithelia , topological defects within a normal hexagonal - packed epithelial promote outlier cells to extrude 5 , 6 . Additionally , C . elegans and mammalian cells with DNA damage or replicative stress are selected for extrusion 6 , 7 . However , as most cell extrusions occur in crowded regions , where cells do not divide or have obvious topological defects , what marks most cells for extrusion has remained a mystery . 3 One possible model is Darwinian , where cells that are fitter remain in epithelia while weaker ones are marked for extrusion and death 8 . One possible measure of cell fitness in this model is cell mass . Cells with higher dry cell mass might be fitter in terms of protein and macromolecule production and maintenance . To test this possibility , we adapted quantitative phase imaging ( QPI ) to analyze dry mass changes over time in Madin - Darby Canine Kidney II ( MDCKII ) epithelial monolayers ( see methods ) 9 , 10 . However , QPI revealed that dry mass does not change prior to cell extrusion , unlike the clear mass increase before a cell divides ( Supplemental Fig . 1A - B and video 1 , representing 31 cells from 12 total cell islands ) , disfavoring cell mass change as a factor for selecting LCE . While investigating cell mass , we noted a consistent , transient increase in cell - cell junction brightness by phase microscopy that lasts ~ 6 . 5 minutes before a cell extrudes ( Fig . 1A , B , and Supplemental Video 2 ) . To readily assay the transient phase brightness , we developed the ‘lightning assay’ that relies on intensity thresholding of junctional brightness surrounding cells before they extrude ( Fig . 1C & D ) . By contrast , less than 0 . 03 % of cells Supplementary Figure 1 . Quantitative phase imaging ( QPI ) shows unaltered dry mass in cells that will extrude . A , As QPI requires a reference area without cells throughout imaging , we grew MDCKII monolayers on confined 100µm islands within a 35 mm dish by plasma treating patterned areas , as in this example . Scale bar = 100µm . B , QPI stills from Supplemental video 1 , representing 31 other cells from 12 QPI islands that similarly show dry mass before cell extrusion , where blue is low cell mass and red is higher mass . Note mass increases after cell extrusion , as the density gets higher with cell contraction ( h : mm ) . C , By contrast , another cell , in red box , increases mass before dividing .

Increased phase brightness might indi - cate a decrease in cell volume or shape . To test if transient volume loss accounts for the phase - brightness before extrusion , we expressed cytoplasmic GFP mosaically in MDCKII cells and measured cell volume throughout extrusion by confocal timelapse microscopy . We find that live cells experience a transient area and volume loss before extruding that corresponds to the junctional brightness measured in our lightning assay ( Fig . 1D , F & G ) . Given this direct correlation between phase brightness and cell volume , we used the lightning assay for mea - suring Homeostatic Early Shrinkage ( HES ) before LCE . Importantly , we find that HES before extrusion occurs in only crowded regions , as measured by cell density ; the few cells that shrink without extruding do so in uncrowded epithelial regions ( Fig . 1H ) . Thus , crowding followed by single cell shrinkage appear to initiate cell extrusion .

One pos - sibility is that this minor population of non - shrinking extrusions were apoptotic , which accounts for ~ 20 - 30 % of extruding cells at steady state in cultured epithelia 1 . Combining a fluorescent reporter of the cleaved caspase - 3 apoptotic marker with the lightning assay , we find cell shrinkage rarely occurs ( ~ 3 % ) before apoptotic extrusion ( Supplemental Fig 2A - B , Supplemental Video 3 ) . Thus , HES typically precedes LCE but not apoptotic extrusion . Transient cell volume loss could be due to myosin II contraction , which occurs before apoptotic extrusion 11 , 12 . To investigate if myosin contraction is important for HES , we inhibited ROCK or myosin II and measured cell shrink - age with our lightning assay . We found blocking myosin II contraction increased the number of cells shrinking by ~ 23X compared to untreated controls ( Fig . 1I ) , suggesting HES occurs independently from myosin contractility . Additionally , HES did not cause blebbing , typically associated with myosin II contraction 13 , 14 , further ruling out a role for myosin contraction in HES . As HES occurs in crowded regions , we investigated if Piezo1 , the SAC required for crowding - induced live cell extrusion 2 , might instead control transient cell volume loss . However , we find that the SAC inhibitor GsMTx4 does not block HES , suggesting Piezo1 acts downstream of HES ( Fig . 1I ) . This was surprising , as our previous studies suggested Piezo1 as the earliest mechano - sensor to trigger extru - sion in response to crowding 1 . Having ruled out dry mass , contractility , and early extrusion regulators as controllers of HES , we next investi - gated if water efflux may regulate the transient volume loss cells experience before extrusion . Cellular water regulation is critical for controlled epithelial cell death 7 , 15 , 16 and could account for the volume changes seen before LCE . To first test if water loss is sufficient to initiate LCE , we incubated MDCKII monolayers in media containing increasing osmolarities ( hypotonic to hypertonic ) for ten minutes before returning to isotonic , control medium to mimic the duration of shrinkage before extrusion ( Supplemental Video 4 & 5 , Fig . 2A ) .

Further , the pan caspase inhibitor zVAD - fmk does not prevent 20 % hypertonic shrink - induced extrusions ( Supplemental Fig . 3A & BB ) , ruling out AVD as a mechanism for hypertonic - induced extrusion . These findings further support that HES controls live but not apoptotic cell extrusion . Interestingly , although the entire monolayer was treated with 20 % hypertonic solution , not all cells shrunk equally . Only cells that shrank 20±3 % as measured by cytoplasmic GFP volume extrude , whereas those shrinking 11±2 . 5 % do not ( Fig . C2C ) . Thus , experimentally reducing cell volume ~ 20 % is sufficient to trigger individual cells to extrude , which we refer to as osmotic - induced cell extrusion ( OICE ) . Since potassium ( K + ) and chloride ( Cl - ) efflux drive water loss during AVD 23 , we investigated if they control HES and extrusion . Using a panel of K + and Cl - channel inhibitors , we assayed for those that block homeostatic ex - trusion rates by timelapse microscopy and immunostained samples . The inhibitor carrier , dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) , can change water permeability of cells 18 , however it did not decrease the basal rate of extrusion , ruling out nonspecific effects ( Fig . 2D and A3A ) . Although most inhibitors were not toxic , the Cl - channel SWELL1 is essential for cell survival 19 , requiring the addition of caspase inhibitor zVAD - fmk to its inhibitor DCPIB for all our DMSOSKI - V2 SKI - II S1P / S1P2 INHIBITOR KINETICS DURING SHRINK C on t r o l D M S O D C P I B + z VA D - f m k A 0 10 20 30 40 E x t r u s i on / 1000 c e ll s ns HYPERTONIC INDUCED EXTRUSION Voltage - gated K + channels Ca 2 + - activated K + channels Cl - Channel channels Contractility Extrusion C on t r o l C on t r o l D M S O A pa m i n T R A M 34 I BX Y 27632 H 1152 B l ebb i s t a t i n S k I - II SK I - V 5 z VA D - f m k 0 10 20 30 E x t r u s i on / 1000 c e ll s ns ns EXTRUSIONS INHIBITING ONLY DURING HYPERTONIC B 4 AP A z i A pa m i n T R A M 34 I BX Y 27632 B l ebb i s t a t i n C C C a C FT R S k I - II SK I - V 5 z VA D - f m k G s M T x 4 F SAC INHIBITOR KINETICS DURING SHRINK E 4AP KINETICS DURING SHRINK 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 Time ( min ) 4APDMSO 7 . 5 10 15 Hypertonic Shock 12 . 5 C DCPIB KINETICS DURING SHRINK 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 N o r m a li z ed A r ea B e t w een C e ll s DMSODCPIB 17 . 5 Hypertonic Shock D DMSOGsMTx4 Targets 10minHyper + Inh 100minIso 10minHyper + Inh 100minIso + Inh 7 . 5 10 15 12 . 5 7 . 5 10 15 12 . 5 7 . 5 10 15 12 . 5 Time ( min ) Time ( min ) Time ( min ) Hypertonic Shock Hypertonic Shock Supplemental Figure 3 .

Remarkably , all inhibitors tested significantly reduced extrusion rates during normal homeostatic turnover to levels seen when SAC channels are inhibited with GSMTx4 ( Fig . 2D and Supplementary Fig 3A ) . Interestingly , 4 - AP , an inhibitor of voltage - gated Kv1 . 1 and Kv1 . 2 channels , also blocks apoptotic extrusion 20 , suggesting a conserved activator for all cell extrusions ( Fig 2D , Supplementary Fig 3A ) . Other channels are implicated in pleotropic diseases , like Kv11 . 1 in carcinomas 21 , 22 and heart arrhythmias 23 and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane receptor ( CFTR ) in cystic fibrosis 24 , suggesting possible new roles for misreg - ulated extrusion in these diseases . While these findings were surprising and suggest interesting future studies , here , we focus solely on those that control the HES step . To determine which K + and Cl - channels , if any , were needed for HES , we first tested which inhibitors blocked extrusions when present only during the 10 - minute hypertonic treatment of OICE . Timelapse phase microscopy revealed that only early inhibition of SACs , Kv channels , and Cl - channels stopped extrusion ( Fig . 3A and Supple - mentary Fig . 3B ) . Even though GsMTx4 does not stop cell shrinkage , it inhibits cell extrusion when inhibited only in the first 10 - minutes , signifying its role early during extrusion pathway , yet downstream of cell shrinkage ( Fig . 1I , 2D ) . Thus , we next investigated if the voltage - gated K + and Cl - channels required in early stages of extrusion regulate both osmotic - induced and homeostatic shrinkage before extrusion . To identify which ion channels regulate HES , we first adapted our lightning assay ( Fig 1D & E ) to measure increas - es in light intensity of all cell - cell junctions within a crowded field in response to a 20 % hypertonic shock , ( Fig . 3B , normalized to isotonic medium ) , as a proxy for cell volume loss . This assay identified only DCPIB ( combined with zVAD - fmk ) and 4 - AP , which target the chloride channel SWELL 1 and the voltage - gated channels Kv1 . 1 , Kv1 . 2 , respectively , as inhibitors of both hypertonic - induced cell shrinkage and extrusion ( Fig . 3A & C & Supplementary Fig . 3A - DD ) . Immunostaining showed that all three channels localize to the cell apex , with Kv1 . 1 co - localizing with ZO - 1 at tight and tri - cellular junctions , regions known to act as tension sensors 25 ( Supplementary Fig . 4A ) . We used siRNA - mediated knockdown to test the roles of Kv1 . 1 , Kv1 . 2 , and SWELL 1 , the targets of 4 - AP and DCPIB , in both OICE and HES ( Suppl . Fig . 4B & C ) . We found that knockdown of any of these channels prevent - ed HES and OICE ( Fig . 3D - F ) , suggesting that they regulate both cell shrinkage and extrusion during normal cell turnover . The fact that Kv1 . 1 , Kv1 . 2 are voltage - gated channels suggested that membrane depolarization could trigger both HES and LCE 26 . Although most frequently studied in neuronal cells , electrical membrane potentials are critical for all cells , requiring between 30 - 70 % of all the energy consumed within a cell , depending on the cell type 27 .

Interestingly , imposing a direct current that reinforces this polarity ( from basal to apical ) enhances and even repairs impaired epithelial cell - cell junctions , whereas reversing the current ( from apical to basal ) causes cells to contract and detach from each other 30 , reminiscent of the cell shrinkage and junctional lightning between cells before extrusion or with hyper - tonic treatment ( Figs . 1F & 3C ) . Since voltage - gated channels control cell shrinkage and experimentally depolarizing a whole epithelial monolay - er produces similar shrinkage of all cells , we next investigated if cells depolarize their membranes before they shrink . To visualize membrane potential , we filmed MDCKII monolayers with the slow - response potential - sensitive probe DiBAC3 ( 4 ) , which increases fluorescence with membrane depolarization31 - 33 . Unlike excitable tissues that rapidly depolarize in an all or nothing reversible manner , we found that MDCKII cells within the monolayer have different membrane potentials ; only some cells become DiBAC3 ( 4 ) - brighter , depolarizing as they crowd and maintaining this depolarized state ( Fig . 4A & B ) . This shows that despite epithelial cells being connected with gap junctions , they are not fully electrically coupled . This also supports our previous finding that cells become Figure 4 : ENaC - dependent depolarization activates cellular shrinkage and extrusion .

K , Model for how ENaC / Kv1 . 1 / Kv1 . 2 / Swell1 - dependent water regulation controls cell size and extrusion , depending on cellular membrane potential . Left : If one cell is more depolarized than its neighboring cells , crowd activation of ENaC will preferentially activate voltage - gated potassium channels in this cell , causing shrink . If this shrink reaches a threshold of ~ 20 % , it will activate the extrusion pathway . Cell elimination by extrusion will alleviate crowding pressure in the monolayer and maintain constant densities . Right : Crowd activation of ENaC in cells with equiva - lent membrane potentials cause moderate voltage - gated potassium - dependent water loss across all cells , resulting in slight cell shrinkage but not enough to activate cell extrusion . Here , slight shrinkage also helps accommodate overall crowding of the monolayer . In this way , crowding can set up competition to eliminate cells with the lowest energy that cannot main - tain a sufficient membrane potential , a significant energy demand for the cell . For all graphs , * * * * P < 0 . 0001 , * * * P < 0 . 001 , * * P < 0 . 0100 . 12 smaller in regions of crowding1 , 34 and suggests that individual cell volume / size may be governed by existing Na + - K + pumps or ATP available to maintain resting membrane potential35 . Importantly , we found that before cells shrink and extrude , they depolarize significantly , becoming DiBAC3 ( 4 ) - brighter ( Fig . 4C - E , Supplemental Video 7 ) , whereas cells that do not shrink , do not depolarize , linking shrinkage to depolarization ( Fig . 4E & F ) . Strikingly , most cells that depolarize before shrinking and extruding have markedly more positive membrane potentials than the cells directly neighboring them ( Fig . 4D and Supplemental Video 6 ) . Thus , as cells within a monolayer experience crowding , those with similar membrane potentials remain in the field and shrink slightly whereas those with strikingly lower potentials are eliminated by extrusion .

Membrane depolarization before voltage - gated dependent cell shrinkage suggests that another channel acti - vates Kv1 . 1 and Kv1 . 2 . One attractive candidate is the Epithelial Sodium Channel ( ENaC ) —a highly conserved , mechanically activated , apically localized ( Supplementary Fig . 4D ) ion channel that causes membrane depolar - ization via Na + entry 36 , 37 . Inhibiting ENaC with amiloride or knocking down any of its subunits ( a , b , or g , Supple - mentary Figs . 4 B & C ) prevented both HES and OICE ( Fig . 4G & H ) . Importantly , ENaC inhibition with amiloride also prevented depolarization of all epithelial cells in response to hypertonic challenge or during steady state turnover ( Fig . 4C & F ) . Because inhibiting Kv1 . 1 and Kv1 . 2 with 4 - AP does not prevent membrane depolarization ( Fig . 4C & F and Supplementary Fig . 5C ) , we surmise that ENaC triggers membrane depolarization , which , in turn , activates the voltage - gated potassium channels Kv1 . 1 and Kv1 . 2 . If ENaC , Kv1 . 1 , Kv1 . 2 , or SWELL1 control epithelial cell shrinkage and extrusion , their loss should change epithelial morphology . We find that deregulating water and extrusion from knockdown of any of these chan - nels , in fact , causes epithelial buckling ( Fig 4 I & J ) . Compared to control monolayers that shrink and extrude in crowded areas 34 ( Fig1 . H ) , those that lack any one of these channels do not undergo HES or OICE ( Figs . 3D - F and Supplementary Figs . 5A , B , & D ) but instead form progressive buckles as cells crowd ( Supplemental Video 8 ) . Thus , cell shrinkage and extrusion alleviate crowding of epithelia sheets to maintain constant numbers and morphology ; when epithelia cannot regulate their volume , they can become buckled ( see schematic below Fig .

Presumably , in wild type tissues , cells must decrease their plasma membranes by endocytosis or other mechanisms to become smaller overall . Decreasing only cell volume without surface area may instead lead to cell pseudo - stratification with crowding . Thus , we suggest that water movement and pressure is sufficient to control epithelial cell numbers and morphologies . Potentially , the set points for water regulation in different epi - thelia could govern whether tissues become buckled like the gut , kidney , and lungs 38 , 39 or pseudostratified , like neuroepithelia 40 and some adenomas 41 , 42 , reinforcing the role of hydrodynamics in morphogenesis 43 While several models could explain our findings , we favor the following model for how crowding , Na + , K + , and Cl - control epithelial cell volume and turnover ( Fig . 4K ) . As epithelial cells divide and accumulate , they cause crowd - ing within a layer , which activates the tension sensitive sodium channel ENaC that depolarizes cells . Membrane depolarization by ENaC activates Kv1 . 1 and Kv1 . 2 that with Swell1 drive water egress and cell shrinkage . Cells with similar membrane potentials will experience depolarization but only slight water loss and shrinkage within a crowded field . However , ENaC - dependent depolarization in a cell that is already more depolarized than its neigh - bors will reach the threshold for Kv activation more readily . Moreover , mechanical forces can reduce the voltage needed to activate Kv channels and increase their maximal current 44 , 45 . Considering this , ENaC - Kv coupling will be more efficient in a crowded , partially depolarized cell than in its neighbours , further amplifying the initial differ - ence . Thus , a cell under mechanical strain would shrink more readily and significantly , with those shrinking > 17 % of their original volumes triggering extrusion . Cell extrusion would also serve to alleviate crowding and ENaC activation in nearby cells , inhibiting the axis and preventing excessive extrusion . Additionally , the differential in membrane potentials between a cell targeted for extrusion and its neighbors could set up a directional current , which has been shown to activate migration during wound healing 46 . While our study revealed a new role for water regulation and membrane potential in regulating epithelial cell ex - trusion and morphology , it also opened several new questions for further investigation . For instance , shrinkage seems to amplify the crowding experienced in a cell that will extrude , but we still lack information as to how tran - sient cell shrinkage activates Piezo1 to trigger S1P signaling vesicles , essential to extrusion 2 - 4 . Further , while we identified potassium and chloride channels essential for HES , it is likely that aquaporins may work in conjunction with these channels to coordinate water loss ; identifying which will be a future goal . Our findings also revealed the importance of other ion channels in regulating extrusion and it will be important to define what roles they play in controlling extrusion . For example , malfunction of ENaC and CFTR are known drivers of Cystic Fibro - sis 24 , 47 , 48 and mutations or misregulation of ENaC , KV1 . 1 , and Kv1 . 2 are indicators of poor prognosis in a variety of cancers 49 , 50 . As epithelial cell extrusion is a fundamental mechanism for epithelial cell turnover , misregulation of extrusion may contribute to disease etiologies arising from mutations in these channels . 15 Our study identifies early voltage and hydrodynamic regulators as the earliest step controlling homeostatic , crowding - induced cell extrusion , a central driver of epithelial cell death . The channels identified here may be specific for kidney epithelia , yet similar channels expressed in different epithelia 51 may analogously tune tissues to enable bending and specific threshold densities for activating cell shrinkage and extrusion , depending upon organ function and shape . METHODS & MATERIALS Cell culture MDCK II cells ( tested for Mycoplasma but not authenticated , gift from K . Matlin , University of Chicago , Chicago , IL ) were cultured in Dulbecco’s minimum essential medium ( DMEM ) high glucose with 10 % FBS ( Thermofisher ) and 100 μg / ml penicillin / streptomycin ( Invitrogen ) at 5 % CO2 , 37°C . Osmolarity solutions To test induction of live cell extrusion a range of solution osmolarities were produced . Since MDCKII cells are cultured in DMEM , D - Mannitol ( Sigma - aldrich , M4125 - 1kg ) or nuclease - free water ( Ambion , AM9937 ) were add - ed to DMEM to create hyper or hypotonic media , respectively . Initial DMEM osmolarity were measured with a freezing point osmometer ( Gonotec , Osmomat 3000 ) , ranged 334 - 368 mOsm / kg . Solutions were tested bi - week - ly and each time a new batch was prepared . Immunostaining Cells were fixed with 4 % formaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 20 min , rinsed three times in PBS , perme - abilised for 5 min with PBS containing 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 , and blocked in AbDil ( PBS 5 % BSA ) . Coverslips were then incubated in primary antibody ( in PBS 1 % BSA ) overnight at 4 ° C , washed three times with PBS , and incu - bated in secondary fluorescently - conjugated antibodies . Antibodies used at 1 : 200 unless otherwise specified : rabbit Piezo1 ( Novus , NBP1 - 78446 ) ; mouse S1P ( Santa Cruz , CA sc - 48356 ) ; rabbit KCNA1 ( Alomone Labs , APC - 161 ) ; rabbit KCNA2 ( Alomone Labs , APC - 010 ) ; rabbit LRRC8A ( Alomone labs , AAC - 001 ) ; mouse ZO1 ( In - vitrogen , 33 - 9100 ) ; rabbit ENaC antibodies SCNNA1 ( Invitrogen , PA1 - 920A ) , SCNNB1 ( Invitrogen , PA5 - 28909 ) , and SCNNG1 ( Invitrogen PA5 - 77797 ) . Alexa Fluor 488 , 568 and 647 goat anti – mouse and anti – rabbit IgG were used as secondary antibodies ( Invitrogen ) . F - actin was stained using either conjugated 488 or 568 Phalloidin ( 66 μ M ) at 1 : 500 and DNA was detected with 1μg / ml DAPI ( Themofisher ) in all fixed cell experiments . Experimental setups and Quantification QPI Micropatterning MDCK II cells for QPI acquisition relies on having nearby cell - free areas for measurement of cell mass . To achieve this , we grew monolayers on small patterned circles within a dish by adhering a silicone laser 16 cut 100 micromesh disk ( Micromesh Array , MMA - 0500 - 100 - 08 - 01 ) on to a non - tissue culture treated 35 mm dish ( Ibidi , 81151 ) . The dishes were plasma treated with mesh in place using a chamber ( Harrick Plasma , Cleaner PD - 32G ) applied in a vacuum ( Agilent Technologies , IDP - 3 Dry Scroll Vacuum pump ) for 10 minutes to create cell adherent coating islands with cell free background ( Supplemental Figure 1A ) . Immediately following plasma treatment , the silicone mesh was aseptically removed and MDCKII cells were seeded at 128 , 000 cell density per well in a microscopy imaging 35 mm dish ( Ibidi , 81151 ) and incubated at 37 ° C for 6 hours in DMEM . Before filming , excess cells were removed from un - patterned areas by gently washed twice with DMEM and grown an - other 48 hours . To image , cells were placed in and on - stage incubator for QPI and islands showing the entire cell island bound - ary and encompassing empty space were filmed . A minimum of two images of empty space were used for back - ground correction . Images were acquired every 2 minutes for 10 hours at 37 ° C , 5 % CO 2 and 88 % humidity . Dry mass was then calculated by subtracting the reference images from the island images to correct background . Next background was flattened by subtracting the background average image to flatten the island images . The phase shift was then converted to dry mass using previous established methods 1 , 2 in Matlab ( version R2022a ) . Extrusions were quantified from 12 separate islands . Volume quantification MDCK II cells were plated at 28 , 000 cell density per well in a microscopy imaging 35 mm dish ( Ibidi , 81156 ) and incubated at 37 ° C overnight or until 60 % confluent . Once 60 % confluent , cells were transfected following manu - facturer’s protocol with Lipofectamine 3000 ( Thermofisher , L3000001 ) with Cytoplasmic GFP plasmid ( addgene , pEGFP - N1 CODE ) for 18 hours . Transfection medium was removed , and cells rinsed twice with 1xPBS and in - cubated in full DMEM until cell to cell junctions were mature ( 72 hours ) . To image , cells were stained with Deep Red Cell Mask ( Thermofisher , 1 . 5 : 1000 ) for 30 minutes and Hoechst ( Invitrogen , 1 : 1000 ) in PBS for 10 minutes at 37 ° C , washed twice with PBS , and then incubated in DMEM media in an enclosed incubated stage at 37°C with 5 % CO 2 ( Oko labs ) and 0 . 4 μ m Z - slices were captured imaged using a spinning disk microscope ( Nikon , Ti2 ) for up to 10 hours every 10 seconds . Images were analysed using a threshold macro ( Nikon Elements AR , 5 . 41 . 02 ) to quantify the volume changes of cells expressing cytoplasmic GFP with cell mask membrane - stained boundaries to highlight extrusions . The volume data was normalized to baseline volume before junctional chang - es and extrusion in Excel ( Microsoft ) and graphed and analysed using GraphPad Prism 9 . 4 . 1 . Serial osmolarity treatment of MDCKII 0 . 53 x10 5 cells were grown to confluence ( ~ 100 hours ) on glass round coverslips 22x55mm ( Academy , 400 - 05 - 21 ) . Epithelial monolayers were incubated with isotonic DMEM for 10 minutes , before treating another 10 minutes in hyper or hypotonic media to induce cell shrinking or swelling , respectively , then replaced in isotonic DMEM for 17 120 mins . Cells were either filmed ( see below ) or fixed and stained for quantifying extrusions . Experiment cell density were analysed with bright spots macro in NIS Elements General Analysis ( Nikon Elements AR , 5 . 41 . 02 ) using DNA staining to determine cell density per field and phalloidin and DNA to identify extrusions . Live Hypertonic Shock For live imaging following hypertonic shock , MDCK II cells were plated on an 8 well slide ( Ibidi , IB - 80801 ) at a seeding density of 10 , 000 cells per well and incubated for ~ 72 hours until monolayers were confluent with mature cell - cell adhesions . Cells were stained with Hoechst ( 1 : 1000 ) in PBS for 10 minutes at 37 ° C , washed twice with PBS , and incubated in isotonic DMEM media ( + / - inhibitors ) , placed in a microscope stage incubator ( 37 ° C , 5 % CO 2 , Okolabs ) , and imaged every 10 seconds for 2 . 5 hours using a widefield microscope ( Nikon , Ti2 specifica - tions below ) . For live cleaved caspase 3 staining , cells were incubated as per manufactures instructions ( 1 : 200 , Incucyte® Caspase - 3 / 7 Dyes ) before treatment and imaging . All experiments consist of three phases : Baseline : 0 - 10minutes - cells incubated in isotonic medium ( + / - inhibitors , see table below or siRNA knockdown Suppl . Fig 3 ) . Hypertonic Challenge - 10 - 20 minutes : imaging is paused , isotonic medium is syphoned off and replaced with 20 % hypertonic medium + / - inhibitors . Imaging promptly restarted to capture shrinkage . Effects on Extrusion - 20minutes - end of imaging : imaging is paused and 20 % hypertonic medium + / - inhibitors is replaced with isotonic medium + / - inhibitors and timelapse imaging resumed to capture extrusions over the next 2hrs .

MDCK II cells were seeded in tandem one set on a 6 well plate ( Thermofisher , 140675 ) at 28 , 000 cell density ( for qPCR analysis ) and the other on a 8 well slide ( Ibidi , IB - 80801 ) at 10 , 000 cell density ( for live cell imaging ) or on coverslips seeded with 53 , 000 MDCK II cells per well on a 24 well plate ( Thermofisher , 142475 ) for extrusion and buckling quantification ( described below ) , and grown overnight until 60 % confluent . Cells were then transfected with RNAi Max kit ( Thermo Fisher , 13778150 ) and 1 μ M siRNA for 24h before re - placing with fresh DMEM for 48h . Cell knockdowns plated for RT - qPCR analyses were lysed for RNA extraction using RNAeasy kit ( Qiagen , 74104 ) , following the manufacturer’s instructions . One μg of RNA was purified with 1 μL of 10x DNAse I Reaction Buffer , 1 μL of DNAse I Amplification and RNase - free water in a final volume of 10 μL . The samples were incubated for 10 min at 37°C then enzyme was deactivated with 1 μL of 0 . 5M EDTA for 10 min at 75°C . Samples were stored at - 20°C . or directly processed by RT - qPCR using Brilliant III Ultra - Fast SYBR Green QRT - PCR Master Mix ( Agilent Technologies ) , using primers designed with SnapGene ® ( version 6 . 1 . 1 ) below and produced by Sigma Aldrich ( see Supplemental Fig 3B for each ) . Reactions were analysed with ViiA 7 Real - Time PCR System ( Thermofisher ) using the following cycle conditions : 50°C for 10 minutes , 95°C for 3 minutes , followed by 40 cycles at 95°C for 15 seconds and 60°C for 30 seconds . Results were normalized to Glyceraldehyde 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) expression and graphed and statistically analysed with GraphPad Prism 9 . 4 . 1 .

To do this , areas of interest were cropped out of larger phase microscopy timelapse movies . Junction intensity changes were collected by applying a simple threshold macro based on white light detection before , during , and briefly after extrusion . The threshold was set to capture the area changes around the cells in the frames before homeostatic or experimental cell shrinkage . The same threshold was applied to all frames of movie until com - pletion of cell extrusion . This same method was used for both single cell and whole regions of crowding in an 85 μ m 2 ( 400 by 400 - pixels ) area . Data were then normalized in Microsoft Excel ( version 16 . 67 ) using an average of 10 frames before lightning and analysing peak percentage change , and then graphed and statistically analysed using GraphPad Prism 9 . 4 . 1 . Buckling MDCK II cells were seeded at 0 . 53 x10 5 on glass round coverslips 22x55mm ( Academy , 400 - 05 - 21 ) for fixed imaging or seeded at 1 . 28 x10 5 cells per well in a 35 mm dish for live imaging . After seeding cells were grown overnight , and transfected with either non - targeting control , KV1 . 1 , KV1 . 2 , SWELL1 , ENaC - α , β , or γ siRNA , as described above . After transfection coverslip plated epithelial cells were incubated for cover 48 hours at 37 ° C , then coverslips were fixed and immuno - stained . siRNA - treated MDCK II cells were imaged using a spinning disk confocal microscope with 0 . 4 μ m thick sections and a maximum height of 32 μ m . After transfection of epithelial cells , plated on 35mm dishes , were incubated 24 hours then live imaging was completed using the widefield microscope . Phase images were captured every 10 minutes for 10 or more hours . For both live and fixed buckle analysis , buckles were scored as mounds with more than 3 connected cells within each field and analysed in Graph Pad Prism 9 . 4 . 1 . Depolarization MDCK II cells were seeded at 128 , 000 cells per well in a 35 mm dish and grown ~ 72 hours to confluence and junctional maturity .

The images were analysed using Nikon Elements AR , 5 . 41 . 02 , using a region of interest ( ROI ) over any cell that was maintained or extruded . ROI mean intensity of DiBAC 4 ( 3 ) in each cell over time was normalized in Excel using 10 baseline frames before shrink and depolarization over time was graphed in GraphPad Prism 9 . 4 . 1 . For neighbour voltage differentials , the cells immediately in contact with an extruding cell were classified as brighter , equal , or darker than the extruding cell , based on DiBAC 4 ( 3 ) intensities . Cell counts where then plotted and analysed in Graph Pad Prism 9 . 4 . 1 20 Microscopy QPI Time - lapse QPI and brightfield images were collected on an Olympus IX83 inverted microscope ( Olympus Corp ) using a 40x NA 0 . 75 objective . Samples were illuminated using red LED light ( 623nm , Thorlabs , DC2200 ) for 120ms exposure a QWLSI wavefront sensing camera - ( Phasics SID4 - 4MP ) , driven by Micro Manager open - source microscopy software . Samples were incubated with a stage - top incubator ( Okolabs ) set at 37 ° C tempera - ture with 5 % CO 2 gas and 95 % humidity . Widefield Timelapse phase and fluorescence images were captured on Nikon Eclipse Ti2 using a Plan Fluor 20x Ph1 DLL NA = 0 . 50 objective with a Photometrics Iris 15 16 - bit camera and a Cool LED pE - 4000 lamp driven by NIS Ele - ments ( Nikon , version 5 . 30 . 02 ) . Spinning disk Images were captured on a Nikon Eclipse Ti2 using 20x , 40x plan fluor 0 . 75 air or 60X or 100X plan fluor 1 . 40 oil objectives with an iXon 888 Andor 16 - bit camera , a Yokogawa CSU - W1 confocal spinning disk unit and Toptica photonics laser driven by NIS Elements ( Nikon , 5 . 21 . 03 ) . Cell staining with phalloidin and Hoechst were quanti - fied for extrusions per 1 , 000 or 10 , 000 cells using Nikon Elements Software . Statistical analysis For statistical analysis , all experiments were repeated on at least three separate days to capture variation in the biological replicates . Data were analysed using statistical software GraphPad Prism 9 . 4 . 1 to measure normality by Shapiro - Wilk test and significance by unpaired t - tests , Two - Way ANOVA , or One - way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparisons , Tukey’s or Sidak’s corrections as described in figure legends . To reduce bias , we imaged random fields within the middle or crowded areas of glass coverslips for quantification or the center of an 8 well dish ( Ibidi 80806 ) for live cell shrink experiments . We excluded low - density epithelia ( fields with less than 2000 cells ) as these regions are not crowded enough to elicit extrusion . Graphs were generated using GraphPad Prism 9 . 4 . 1 . Figure layouts and models were created in Adobe Illustrator ( 26 . 3 . 1 ) . 1 Pradeep , S . & Zangle , T . A .

K , Model for how ENaC / Kv1 . 1 / Kv1 . 2 / Swell1 - dependent water regulation controls cell size and extrusion , depending on cellular membrane potential . Left : If one cell is more depolarized than its neighboring cells , crowd activation of ENaC will preferentially activate voltage - gated potassium channels in this cell , causing shrink . If this shrink reaches a threshold of ~ 20 % , it will activate the extrusion pathway . Cell elimination by extrusion will alleviate crowding pressure in the monolayer and maintain constant densities . Right : Crowd activation of ENaC in cells with equivalent membrane potentials cause moderate voltage - gated potassium - dependent water loss across all cells , resulting in slight cell shrinkage but not enough to activate cell extrusion . Here , slight shrinkage also helps accommodate overall crowding of the monolayer . In this way , crowding can set up competition to eliminate cells with the lowest energy that cannot maintain a sufficient membrane potential , a significant energy demand for the cell .

Quantitative phase imaging ( QPI ) shows unaltered dry mass in cells that will extrude . A , As QPI requires a reference area without cells throughout imaging , we grew MDCKII monolayers on confined 100mm islands within a 35 mm dish by plasma treating patterned areas , as in this example . Scale bar = 100mm .
