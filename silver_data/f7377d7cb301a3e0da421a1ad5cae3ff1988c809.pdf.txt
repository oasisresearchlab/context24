Introduction Early endosomes ( EEs ) are highly dynamic compartments that act as entry portals , sorting stations , and signaling platforms [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] . They sort molecules and direct them into the appropriate pathway . Degradative molecules are sorted into particular membrane domains and this process is followed by maturation along with acidification and formation of intraluminar vesicles , referred to as multivesicular bodies ( MVBs ) [ 2 , 4 ] . Finally , MVBs / late endosomes ( LEs ) fuse with lysosomes where protein degradation occurs . However , recycling molecules are directly transported to the plasma membrane ( PM ) by vesicular transport [ 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ] or indirectly by recycling endosomes ( REs ) via large tubules [ 9 ] . Much progress has been made in understanding MVB biogenesis [ 10 ] . However , the process of membrane remodeling for the recycling pathway , including tubula - tion and segregation activities , remains to be elucidated . Membrane remodeling is induced by lipid - interacting proteins , lipid - modifying enzymes , and cytoskeletons and their related proteins [ 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 ] . Of these , recent evidence has indicated that actin plays essential roles in endosome biogenesis [ 18 , 19 , 20 ] . The role of actin in intracellular trafficking is well known for endocytosis , phagocytosis , and bacterial motility . In endocytosis , actin may provide a motile force to assist the fission activity of dynamin GTPase [ 21 ] . Actin functions in short - range movements through actin - rich regions [ 22 , 23 ] and may be involved in endosome movement [ 24 ] , cargo transport [ 25 , 26 ] , and endosome morphology [ 27 ] . Recent studies have shown that several actin - related proteins are required for endosomal actin reorganization . These include myosin1B [ 27 ] , N - WASP [ 28 ] , cortactin [ 26 ] , CART , an Hrs / actinin - 4 / BERP / myosin V protein complex [ 29 ] , Annexin A2 , Spire1 , and Arp2 / 3 [ 20 ] . As actin polymerization is a good candidate for inducing a motile force for membrane fission , understanding actin regulation of intracellular transport is sure to be a key step for further elucidating membrane trafficking . In this report , to determine the role of actin filaments in relation to EEs , we investigated the inhibitory effects of actin dynamics on both the transport from EEs and endosome morphology . We found that inhibition of actin dynamics induced the enlargement of EEs with several distinct vacuoles and inhibited their transportation ability . Moreover , cortactin , an actin - nucleating factor , was found to be required for segregation in EEs . Thus , actin and cortactin are required for efficient transport of endosomes toward the perinuclear region . We propose that actin and cortactin play essential roles in segregation relating to the recycling and degradative pathways and in transport toward the perinuclear region in coordination with microtubules . Results Actin dynamics regulate transport beyond EEs We initially investigated whether actin plays an essential role in transport from EEs . Internalized transferrin ( Tfn ) signals were partially , but clearly colocalized with actin 10 min after internal - ization ( Fig . 1A ) , indicating that actin localizes in EEs , as has been reported previously [ 24 , 30 ] . Next , to investigate the significance of actin filaments in EEs , we used latrunculinB ( LatB ) as an actin depolymerizing agent [ 31 ] . For visualization of transport from EEs , we used fluorescence - labeled Tfn and EGF as tracers for the recycling and degradative pathways , respectively . HeLa cells were bound to these ligands on ice , washed , and incubated at 37 u C for PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 1 May 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 5 | e19942 5 min with ligand - free medium . Cells were then incubated with DMSO ( as a control ) or LatB - containing medium . At 30 min after internalization of Tfn or EGF , few Tfn signals were observed and EGF signals moved to the cell center . Both ligands were not colocalized with EEA1 , an EE marker . These data indicate that Tfn was recycled and that EGF reached LEs / lysosomes ( Fig . 1B , upper panels ) . On the other hand , in LatB - treated cells , Tfn signals were still visible and colocalized with EGF in enlarged endosomes . These enlarged endosomes had distinct vacuole domains containing EGF and also colocalized with the early endosomal marker , EEA1 ( Fig . 1B , lower panels ) . These results suggest that intra - endosomal sorting between the degradative and recycling molecules is independent of actin , but that segregation between the pathways depends on actin polymerization . This phenotype was apparently observed only when LatB was added 5 min after ligand internal - ization . Following addition of LatB at 15 min after ligand internalization , the number of vacuole clusters appeared to decrease . Moreover , addition at 30 min after ligand internalization did not induce any vacuole clustering ( data not shown ) . Next , we investigated the effect of jasplakinolide ( jasp ) , a drug that stabilizes actin filaments and promotes actin polymerization [ 32 ] . As shown in Fig . 1C , the size and appearance of endosomes were very similar to that observed with LatB - treated cells . Although we couldnâ€™t discriminate whether these enlarged endosomes are composed from fusion or cluster of endosomes , due to limitation of resolution , these results suggest that actin dynamics including polymerization and depolymerization are required for transport from EEs . The ratio of Tfn colocalization with EGF ( Fig . 1D ) in control cells showed that peak colocalization occurred at 5 min after ligand internalization and rapidly decreased until 30 min ; no colocalization was observed at 60 min . In contrast , LatB treatment significantly inhibited the reduction of colocalization ; however , colocalization decreased after washout of LatB , as in control cells ( Fig . 1D ) . We further quantified the rate of recycling ( Fig . 1E ) and degradation ( Fig . 1F ) under LatB treatment using a biochemical assay . Biotin - labeled Tfn or EGF was internalized , and the intracellular contents were quantified by enzymatic activity using avidin - HRP ( see Materials and Methods ) . In contrast to immunofluorescence data ( fig . 1B ) , there was no significant difference between control and LatB - treated cells at 30 min after internalization . This was probably because microscopic observation largely depends on their size and concentration . At 120 min , LatB treatment significantly reduced Tfn recycling ( , 40 % ) compared with control cells ( , 20 % , p , 0 . 01 , Fig . 1E ) . Similarly , EGF degradation was also delayed by LatB treatment ( Fig . 1F ) . These results indicate that actin dynamics play a role in both recycling and degradation . The recycling pathway has two independent routes ; one is a direct pathway from EEs to PM and the second is an indirect Figure 1 . Actin localized in EEs and was required for transport from EEs . HeLa cells internalized Alexa555 - Tfn for 5 min and were then fixed and stained with Alexa488 - phalloidin to enable visualization of the F - actin filaments ( A ) . Cells internalized Alexa488 - EGF and Alexa555 - EGF ( B , left panels and C ) or Alexa555 - Tfn ( B , center panels ) and Alexa555 - EGF ( B , right panels ) for 5 min . DMSO ( B , upper panels ) , LatB ( B , lower panels ) , or jasp ( C ) was then added to the medium and cells were incubated for 25 min . Cells were fixed and stained using anti - EEA1 ( B , center and right panels ; green ) . Signals where Tfn colocalized with EGF are summarized in D . Intracellular Tfn ( E ) and EGF ( F ) were measured using ELISA assay as described in Materials and Methods using biotin - conjugated ligands and are presented as percentages against 5 min . Error bars represent the SEM from three independent experiments . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0019942 . g001 Endosomal Trafficking by Actin Filaments PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 2 May 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 5 | e19942 pathway to PM via REs [ 9 ] . The direct pathway uses vesicle transport , which requires PI3 - kinase activity and is inhibited by LY294002 ( LY ) , a specific inhibitor of PI3 - kinase [ 7 ] . To determine which pathway is dependent on actin dynamics , we used LY in combination with LatB . As shown in Figure S1A , Tfn was recycled or dissociated from EGF in control or LY - treated cells . EGF - containing endosomes were relocated to the perinucle - ar region , suggesting that EGF was transported to LEs / lysosomes . On the other hand , in LatB - or LatB / LY - treated cells , Tfn remained colocalized with EGF even at 30 min after internaliza - tion and these EEs were enlarged . This colocalization persisted until at least 60 min after internalization ( data not shown ) . The quantitative analysis showed that intracellular Tfn was significant - ly increased in LatB / LY - treated cells ( , 82 % ) compared with control cells ( , 45 % ) , LY - ( , 62 % ) , and LatB - treated cells ( , 66 % , Fig . S1B ) . These effects of LatB / LY on Tfn recycling suggest that the LatB - sensitive pathway differs from the LY - sensitive pathway and may be an EE - to - RE pathway . Disruption of actin dynamics induces enlarged endosomes As disruption of actin dynamics induced the formation of abnormal enlarged endosomes , we compared endosomal structure between control - , LatB - , and jasp - treated cells using 3D reconstruction ( Fig . 2A ) . In control cells , endosomes containing both EGF and Tfn were observed until 15 min after internaliza - tion ( Fig . 2B and movie S1 ) , but not at 30 min after internalization ( see Fig . 1B ) . On the other hand , in LatB - or jasp - treated cells , endosomes containing several vacuolar domains as well as tubular domains were seen even at 30 min after internalization ( Fig . 2B , movie S2 and S3 ) . The vacuolar domain - containing endosomes were not detected in control cells . Figure 2 . Inhibition of actin dynamics induced homotypic fusion of EEs . HeLa cells internalized both Alexa488 - Tfn and Alexa555 - EGF for 5 min at 37 u C before the addition of DMSO ( left ) , LatB ( 5 m g / ml , center ) , or jasp ( right ) . Images were taken at 15 min ( DMSO ) or 25 min ( LatB and jasp ) ( A ) . The structure of endosomes containing both EGF and Tfn was visualized by 3D reconstruction with a rotation angle of 30 u ( B ) . Live imaging of EEs . Cells were treated as in A , and images were taken at 10 min ( DMSO ) or 25 min ( LatB ) after the addition of each drug . After 30 min , LatB - treated cells were washed and images were taken at 5 min ( LatB w / o ) . Representative images are shown . The arrow indicates a fission event . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0019942 . g002 Endosomal Trafficking by Actin Filaments PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 3 May 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 5 | e19942 Next , we observed the formation of enlarged endosomes in LatB - treated cells using live cell imaging . In control cells , Tfn - containing tubules extended from endosomes and fission was observed frequently ( Fig . 2C , upper panel and movie S4 ) . However , in LatB - treated cells , endosomes rapidly fused with each other , resulting in enlarged endosomes with few short tubules ( Fig . 2C , middle panel and movie S5 ) . After washout of LatB , Tfn - containing tubular structures immediately segregated from endosomes and clusters of vacuolar domains dissociated from each other ( Fig . 2C , bottom panel and movie S6 ) . At 15 min after washout , these clusters were dissociated , and at 60 min after washout , EGF - containing endosomes localized around the peri - nuclear region and finally disappeared ( data not shown ) . These data clearly indicate that disruption of the actin filaments induced aggregation of EEs , resulting in the formation of enlarged EEs . On the other hand , actin polymerization made the vacuolar domains pull apart and severed the tubules containing recycling molecules . Disruption of actin filaments is not required for transition to the LE and RE stage We demonstrated that LatB treatment induced abnormal enlargement of EEs , judging from colocalization with EEA1 . However , there was a possibility that LatB treatment blocked the transition from EEs to LEs and / or REs because EEs have a mosaic structure [ 33 ] . EEs move from the cell periphery to perinuclear region in a microtubule - dependent manner and mature to LEs ; this process is accompanied by both recruitment of an LE marker LAMP1 and intraluminar acidification [ 2 , 4 , 34 ] . Therefore , we investigated the effect of actin polymerization on endosomal maturation . In control cells , the EGF signals were colocalized with Lamp1 at 30 , 60 , and 120 min after internalization ( Fig . 3A ) . Interestingly , the same results were obtained in LatB - treated cells , indicating that EEs containing EGF were partially converted to LEs . The same results were obtained using lysotracker , an acidic sensor ( Fig . 3B ) . On the other hand , Rab11 , a marker of REs , was not colocalized with EGF ( Fig . 3C ) , suggesting that transferrin did not reach recycling endosomes . When we analyzed whether early and late endosomes fuse together in a heterotypic manner by localization of these specific markers , they were not co - localized but adjacently localized ( Fig . 3D ) . These results indicate that the transition from EE to LE did not depend on actin dynamics , although the degradative / recycling components remain the same organelle . Actin contributes to early endosomal motility Actin filaments have been reported to be responsible for short - range movement of peripheral endosomes [ 35 , 36 ] . In contrast , Figure 3 . Actin depolymerization blocked transition from EE to LE . HeLa cells internalized Alexa555 - EGF for 5 min at 37 u C and DMSO or LatB was then added . After 30 , 60 , or 120 min , cells were fixed and stained with anti - Lamp1 ( A ) or incubated with Lysotracker ( B ) for 15 min or 30 min . GFP - rab11 transfected HeLa cells were internalized Alexa555 - transferrin , treated with LatB for 30 min and fixed ( C ) . Cells , which were treated with LatB for 30 min , fixed and stained with anti - EEA1 ( red ) and anti - Lamp1 ( green . D ) . Samples were observed using a confocal microscope . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0019942 . g003 Endosomal Trafficking by Actin Filaments PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 4 May 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 5 | e19942 microtubules are responsible for long - range movements between the perinuclear and peripheral region . Therefore , we compared endosomal motility in the presence of LatB and nocodazole ( a microtubule depolymerizing drug ) . In control cells , long - range directional movements toward the cell center were observed ( Fig . 4A and movie S7 ) . In contrast , we hardly detected any endosomal movements in nocodazole treated cells , suggesting that endosomal movements largely depend on microtubules ( Fig . 4A and movie S8 ) . However , in LatB - treated cells , EGF - containing endosomes moved rapidly in random directions and fused with each other ( Fig . 4A and movie S9 ) . Endosomes moved toward the cell center in the control cells , but in LatB - treated cells few movements toward the perinuclear region were observed despite frequent random movements ( Fig . 4B ) . The tracking analysis clearly indicated that actin polymerization was required for directional movement toward the perinuclear region . Next , to observe more directly the endosomal movements induced by actin polymerization , we used both LatB and nocodazole , followed by removal of only LatB to induce actin polymerization . When cells were treated with both LatB and nocodazole , enlarged EEs containing several clusters of EGF were observed ( Fig . 4C ) . However , after removal of LatB , the EGF clusters spread quickly and had both tubular and vacuolar domains . As time progressed , EGF - containing vacuolar domains dispersed further and Tfn gradually disappeared . To quantify this dispersion , we measured the area of endosomes ( Fig . 4D ) . The EE area was significantly increased at 5 min after the LatB washout . These results indicate that actin polymerization is required for both inhibition of homotypic fusion of endosomes through microtubule - independent movements and transport from EEs . Cortactin regulates actin dynamics at EEs We attempted to identify a specific regulator of actin dynamics at EEs since Arp2 / 3 and its regulatory elements have been suggested to play an essential role in EEs [ 18 , 20 ] and its activator cortactin [ 37 ] . We also verified localization of Arp2 / 3 and cortactin at endosomes ( Fig . 5A ) and determined whether cortactin was required for endosomal sorting and recovery from LatB treatment . Cortactin was depleted by introducing cortactin - specific siRNAs ( Fig . 5B ) , and the effects on both the recycling and degradation pathways were investigated . As shown in Fig . 5C , Tfn remained with EGF at 30 min after internalization in cortactin siRNA cells . Even at 60 min after internalization , Tfn signals were clearly recognized in cortactin siRNA cells and were partially colocalized with EGF ( Fig . 5C and summarized in Fig . 5D ) . Similar results were obtained by another cortactin siRNA ( not shown ) . These data suggest that segregation at EEs was impaired in cortactin - siRNA cells . Cortactin - siRNA cells were subsequently treated with LatB and their recovery after treatment was observed . As described above , at 10 min after LatB washout , both dispersion and segregation of endosomes was observed in control cells ( Fig . 5C , upper panels ) . On the other hand , clusters of endosomes were still observed at 30 min after washout in cortactin - siRNA cells . These results indicate that cortactin is required for actin assembly in EEs and for subsequent segregation . Discussion The role of actin in endosomes remains unclear , and several not mutually exclusive scenarios can be evoked . These include regulated endosome anchoring onto the actin network at the cell periphery , remodeling of the actin network by endocytic vesicles along their trajectory , endosome motility along existing actin filaments , and possible rocketing via de novo F - actin formation . Alternatively , actin may play an active role in membrane remodeling during endosome biogenesis . In this study , we revealed that actin is required for segregation in EEs , and it induces movement of each endosome toward the cell center by preventing their fusion . Further , we identified cortactin as a key regulator of actin in EEs . We propose that both actin and cortactin are involved in transport from EEs and that these function in two distinct steps ( a hypothetical model is illustrated in Fig . 6 ) . Actin filaments are involved in efficient segregation in EEs The recruitment of actin filaments to EEs has been observed previously [ 30 , 38 ] . Here , we demonstrated that inhibition of actin dynamics led to the formation of enlarged EEs and impaired transport from EEs . Simultaneous application of LatB and LY significantly inhibited Tfn recycling compared with individual LatB and LY applications . These results suggest that LatB and LY act in distinct pathways , and that actin might be involved in the EE - to - RE pathway , which is independent of PI3K . In fact , LatB treatment resulted in reduction in tubule formation from EEs . This leads to the major question , what is the role of actin in transport from EEs ? Recently , it has been shown that actin dynamics induce scission of membrane tubules [ 39 ] . Other researchers have also suggested that actin dynamics play a role in membrane scission [ 21 , 40 ] . These experiments focused on the internalization steps at PM , but this actin - induced scission may also apply to EEs . SNX4 has been shown to be a candidate factor driving membrane tubulation in the EE - to - RE pathway [ 41 ] , and may contribute to membrane tubulation and scission together with actin dynamics . Another study also reported that myosin VI ( a minus end - directed actin motor ) and its interacting protein lemur tyrosine kinase 2 siRNAs led to swollen , enlarged EEs and reduced EHD3 - containing tubule formation [ 19 ] . These results suggest that actin motor proteins also participate in the EE - to - RE pathway . Indeed , at the trans - Golgi network , GOLPH3 bridges phosphatidylinositol and actomyosin to promote efficient tubulation and vesicle formation [ 42 ] . We propose that actin filaments contribute to efficient fission by cooperating with factors driving membrane tubulation , such as SNX4 ( Fig . 6A ) . Actin is required for perinuclear localization of endosomes Actin polymerization has been shown to be involved in homotypic fusion of endosomes as well as yeast vacuoles . In Dictyostelium , inhibition of actin polymerization induced LEs to form clusters and blocked endosomal transport and movement , suggesting that the actin coat surrounding LEs prevents endo - somes from clustering , docking , and fusing with each other . [ 43 ] On the other hand , fusion between phagosomes and LEs and between LEs themselves is affected by the inhibition of actin polymerization in vitro , indicating that the actin filaments assembled on LEs or phagosomes may facilitate endosomal fusion . These findings suggest that the actin filaments may regulate endosomal fusion at several distinct steps during intracellular transport . We demonstrated that EEs fused with each other forming enlarged EEs after inhibition of actin dynamics . On the other hand , induction of actin - polymerization by LatB washout induced dissociation of EEs and translocation of each vacuolar domain . Furthermore , we observed that the dissociation of EEs by actin polymerization was independent of microtubules . Thus , actin filaments may provide a track for actin - based motor proteins to Endosomal Trafficking by Actin Filaments PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 5 May 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 5 | e19942 Figure 4 . Actin pulls endosomes apart for directional movement . HeLa cells internalized Alexa555 - EGF for 5 min at 37 u C and DMSO or LatB was added subsequently . Nocodazole was added before the addition of the ligands and cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 u C . Live cell images were taken at 15 min after internalization using confocal microscopy and a pattern of colors and dots was assigned to each particle . Shape of cells and nucleus are illustrated by dotted lines . Twelve representative tracks are shown for each treatment . The movement of EGF - positive vesicles was tracked with Image J software ( A ) .

As the actin - dependent movement was limited among endosomes , the observation of endosomal movement under nocodazole treatment would be difficult ( Fig . 4A ) . Actin polymerization is not required for the EE - to - LE transition We found that inhibition of actin dynamics impaired EGF degradation . Although EGF - containing endosomes were EEA1 - positive , they also colocalized with LAMP1 , an LE marker , and exhibited intra - endosomal acidification . These results suggest that actin dynamics may be required downstream of endosomal acidification . EEs and other endocytic compartments are acidified by V - ATPase [ 44 , 45 ] . V - ATPase interacts with ARNO and Arf6 in EEs and regulates the protein degradative pathway [ 46 ] . As Arf6 has been implicated in the rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton [ 47 ] , LatB might inhibit actin rearrangement downstream of Arf6 . Cortactin regulates actin polymerization at EEs We have shown that the Arp2 / 3 complex , which initiates assembly of new filaments from the sides of pre - existing filaments to generate a network of branched filament arrays , exists in EEs . In general , the Arp2 / 3 complex is stimulated by binding to the side of actin filaments as well as to a nucleation - promoting factor ( NPF ) . NPFs include N - WASP , WASP , and cortactin . Cortactin Figure 5 . Cortactin is required for endosome biogenesis .

In addition to linking actin organization and signal transduction , cortactin has emerged as a key protein involved in the coordination of membrane dynamics and cytoskeleton remodeling . Recent evidence shows that protein kinase C d and calmodulin regulate receptor recycling from EEs through Arp2 / 3 and cortactin [ 26 ] . Our results show that cortactin may also be a key regulator of actin dynamics at EEs as cortactin siRNA impaired transport from EEs . A recent report has also revealed that WASH ( an NPF ) is required for endosome fission [ 18 ] . WASH localizes on Tfn - containing EEs and is required for efficient recycling from these . Cortactin may be a downstream target of WASH at EEs as WASH siRNA resulted in the loss of cortactin recruitment onto EEs . Determining the network of actin regulators and tubulation driving factors would provide precise knowledge of the sorting machinery involved in intracellular membrane transport .

For Tfn and EGF binding , the medium was replaced with serum - free DMEM containing Alexa488 - or Alexa555 - conjugated Tfn or Alexa555 - conjugated EGF ( Molecular Probes ) and cells were incubated for 1 h on ice . Cells were then washed with cold phosphate - buffered saline and incubated with 10 % FBS / DMEM at 37 u C . LatB ( 5 m g / ml ) , Jasp ( 1 m M ) or LY294002 ( 100 m M ) were added 5 min after Tfn and EGF internalization and cells were incubated for the time periods described . The treated cells were fixed with 3 . 7 % formaldehyde for 15 min at RT and immunofluorescence was performed as described previously [ 49 ] . Imaging analysis Colocalization of Tfn and EGF fluorescence at EEs was calculated using MetaMorph software ( Universal Imaging Corpo - ration ) . The threshold of fluorescence was determined by a 15 min - based DMSO control . Colocalization was calculated by measuring the ratio of Tfn to EGF signals . We quantified 10 cell images and averaged these ( excluding two extreme values ) . For 3D reconstruction , Z - series imaging of the samples was performed in 0 . 1 - m m increments . These images were reconstructed with MetaMorph software . For area measurements , the endosome cluster area was enclosed with a circle and measured with Image J software ( National Institutes of Health ) . Live imaging and tracking analysis HeLa cells plated on a 35 - mm diameter dish with a glass base were treated with DMSO or LatB as in the immunofluorescence experiments . Time - lapse images were taken using a confocal microscope and were acquired every 2 s . These images were reconstituted with MetaMorph software . The tracking analysis samples were taken using video microscopy , and the tracking analysis was performed with Image J software ( National Institutes of Health ) . ELISA assay HeLa cells were plated on a 24 - well plate , grown in serum - free medium for 1 h , and incubated with biotin - human transferrin or biotin - human EGF for 1 h on ice to facilitate binding to the cell surface . The ligands were internalized at 37 u C , and cells were incubated for the times indicated with the appropriate reagents . To measure Tfn recycling and EGF degradation , ELISA assays were performed as described [ 50 ] . A peroxidase coloring kit ( SUMILON ) was used for the enzymatic reaction and light absorption was determined with a microplate reader ( MTP 300 ; Hitachi ) in order to quantify intracellular Tfn and EGF .
