We addressed this gap using data from the WISDOM ( Working to Implement and Sustain Digital Outcome Measures ) hybrid type III effectiveness‑implementation trial . Primary outcomes from WISDOM indicated the Leader‑ ship and Organizational Change for Implementation ( LOCI ) strategy improved fidelity to measurement‑based care ( MBC ) in youth mental health services . In this study , we tested LOCI’s hypothesized mechanisms of change , namely : ( 1 ) LOCI will improve implementation and transformational leadership , which in turn will ( 2 ) mediate LOCI’s effect on implementation climate , which in turn will ( 3 ) mediate LOCI’s effect on MBC fidelity . Methods Twenty‑one outpatient mental health clinics serving youth were randomly assigned to LOCI plus MBC training and technical assistance or MBC training and technical assistance only . Clinicians rated their leaders’ imple‑ mentation leadership , transformational leadership , and clinic implementation climate for MBC at five time points ( baseline , 4‑ , 8‑ , 12‑ , and 18‑months post‑baseline ) . MBC fidelity was assessed using electronic metadata for youth outpatients who initiated treatment in the 12 months following MBC training . Hypotheses were tested using longitu‑ dinal mixed‑effects models and multilevel mediation analyses . Results LOCI significantly improved implementation leadership and implementation climate from baseline to fol‑ low‑up at 4‑ , 8‑ , 12‑ , and 18‑month post‑baseline ( all p s < . 01 ) , producing large effects ( range of ds = 0 . 76 to 1 . 34 ) . LOCI’s effects on transformational leadership were small at 4 months ( d = 0 . 31 , p = . 019 ) and nonsignificant there‑ after ( p s > . 05 ) . LOCI’s improvement of clinic implementation climate from baseline to 12 months was mediated by improvement in implementation leadership from baseline to 4 months ( proportion mediated [ p m ] = 0 . 82 , p = . 004 ) . Transformational leadership did not mediate LOCI’s effect on implementation climate ( p = 0 . 136 ) . Improvement in clinic implementation climate from baseline to 12 months mediated LOCI’s effect on MBC fidelity during the same period ( p m = 0 . 71 , p = . 045 ) . * Correspondence : Nathaniel J .

Implementation Science ( 2024 ) 19 : 29 Conclusions LOCI improved MBC fidelity in youth mental health services by improving clinic implementation climate , which was itself improved by increased implementation leadership . Fidelity to EBPs in healthcare settings can be improved by developing organizational leaders and strong implementation climates . Trial registration ClinicalTrials . gov identifier : NCT04096274 .

Keywords Implementation leadership , Implementation climate , LOCI , Mechanism , Mediator , Measurement‑based care , Youth , WISDOM Contributions to the literature • This is the first study to experimentally test whether increases in organizational leaders’ use of implementa - tion leadership and transformational leadership behav - ior contribute to improved organizational implemen - tation climate which in turn contributes to improved clinician fidelity to a clinical intervention . • We found that a leader - focused implementation strat - egy ( a ) improved implementation climate by increas - ing leaders’ use of implementation leadership and ( b ) improved clinician fidelity to a clinical intervention by enhancing implementation climate . • This study offers robust evidence that organizational leaders can improve evidence - based practice imple - mentation in healthcare settings by exhibiting imple - mentation leadership behaviors and creating support - ive implementation climates within their organizations . • This study provides an example of rigorous multilevel mediation analyses for testing proposed mechanisms of implementation strategies . Background Many implementation theories and frameworks in healthcare assert the importance of organizational lead - ership and organizational implementation climate for achieving high fidelity to newly implemented clini - cal interventions [ 1 – 6 ] ; however , the evidentiary basis for these claims is thin . The usual standard for making causal claims in the medical and social sciences is dem - onstration of effect within a randomized controlled trial [ 7 ] ; yet , recent reviews indicate no trials have tested whether experimentally induced change in organiza - tional leadership or organizational implementation cli - mate contributes to improved implementation of clinical interventions in healthcare [ 8 , 9 ] . In the present study , we address this gap using data from the WISDOM ( Working to Implement and Sustain Digital Outcome Measures ) hybrid type III effectiveness - implementation trial . The WISDOM trial showed that a strategy called Leadership and Organizational Change for Implementation ( LOCI ) [ 10 , 11 ] , which targets organizational leadership and organizational implementation climate , improved fidelity to measurement - based care ( MBC ) in outpatient mental health clinics serving youth [ 12 ] . In this paper , we tested LOCI’s hypothesized mechanisms of change . Specifically , we tested whether improvement in clinic leadership con - tributed to improvement in clinic implementation cli - mate and whether improved implementation climate in turn contributed to improved MBC fidelity . Measurement‑based care in youth mental health Measurement - based care is an evidence - based practice ( EBP ) that involves the collection of standardized symp - tom rating scales from patients prior to each treatment session and use of the results to guide treatment deci - sions [ 13 ] . Meta - analyses of over 30 randomized con - trolled trials indicate feedback from MBC improves the outcomes of mental health treatment relative to services as usual across patient ages , diagnoses , and intervention modalities [ 14 – 17 ] . There is also evidence MBC improves mental health medication adherence [ 18 ] , reduces risk of treatment dropout [ 14 ] , and is particularly effective for youths and for patients who are most at risk for treat - ment failure [ 14 – 16 , 18 ] . Unfortunately , MBC is rarely used in practice . Only 14 % of clinicians who deliver mental health services to youth in the USA use any form of MBC [ 19 ] , and MBC usage rates are similarly low in other countries [ 20 , 21 ] . When MBC use is mandated , less than half of clinicians view feedback and use it to guide treatment [ 22 – 24 ] . Digi - tal MBC systems ( i . e . , measurement feedback systems ) remove many practical barriers to MBC implementation by collecting measures from patients electronically ( e . g . , via tablet or phone ) and instantaneously generating feed - back [ 25 ] . However , even when these systems are avail - able , clinician fidelity to MBC—defined as administering measures , viewing feedback reports , and using the infor - mation to guide treatment—is often substandard [ 22 , 26 ] . Qualitative and quantitative studies of MBC implementa - tion indicate clinicians’ work environments explain much of the variation in their attitudes toward , and use of , MBC [ 19 , 27 , 28 ] , with organizational leadership and supportive organizational culture or organizational implementation climate identified as key determinants [ 13 , 28 – 30 ] . Page 3 of 16 Williams et al . Implementation Science ( 2024 ) 19 : 29 Mechanisms of the LOCI strategy LOCI is a multicomponent organizational implemen - tation strategy that engages organizational executives and first - level leaders ( i . e . , those who administratively supervise clinicians ) to build an organizational climate to support the implementation of a focal EBP with fidel - ity [ 10 , 31 ] . It includes two overarching components : ( 1 ) monthly organizational strategy meetings between executives and LOCI consultants / trainers to develop and embed policies , procedures , and practices that sup - port implementation of a focal EBP and ( 2 ) training and coaching for first - level leaders , to develop their skills in leading implementation . Organizational survey data and feedback guide planning , goal specification , and progress monitoring for both components . The aim of these com - ponents is to develop an organizational implementation climate [ 32 , 33 ] in which clinicians perceive that use of a specific EBP with high fidelity is expected , supported , and rewarded [ 34 ] . Figure 1 shows LOCI’s theoretical model as applied to MBC in the present study . This model forms the basis for the study hypotheses . The LOCI strategy draws on two leadership theories—full - range leader - ship [ 35 , 36 ] and implementation leadership [ 37 ] —and on theories of organizational implementation climate [ 33 , 34 ] , to explain variation in implementation success and to identify targets for implementation improve - ment . As is shown in Fig . 1 , LOCI seeks to equip first - level leaders ( e . g . , clinical program managers ) , with two types of leadership behaviors believed to influ - ence implementation success . Transformational lead - ership , drawn from the full - range leadership model , is a general type of leadership that reflects a leader’s ability to inspire and motivate employees to follow an ideal or course of action [ 38 , 39 ] . Implementation leadership is a type of focused leadership that refers to leader behaviors that facilitate the organization’s spe - cific strategic objective of successfully implementing a focal EBP , such as MBC [ 37 , 40 – 44 ] . As is shown in the figure , LOCI aims to increase first - level leaders’ use of these leadership behaviors in order to support the development of an implementation climate that prompts and supports clinicians’ use of the focal EBP with high fidelity . Correlational studies offer preliminary support for the relationships shown in Fig . 1 . In a 5 - year study of 30 outpatient mental health clinics serving youth , Wil - liams et al . [ 45 ] showed that increases in implementa - tion leadership at the clinic level were associated with increases in clinic EBP implementation climate , which subsequently predicted increases in clinicians’ self - reported use of evidence - based psychotherapy tech - niques . Other studies have shown that higher levels of organizational implementation climate predict higher observed fidelity to evidence - based mental health inter - ventions in outpatient clinics and schools [ 46 , 47 ] . In the other fully powered trial of LOCI that is currently pub - lished [ 48 ] , researchers studying mental health care in Norway showed that LOCI improved first - level leaders’ implementation leadership , transformational leadership , and clinic implementation climate for trauma - focused EBPs . However , no studies have tested the two key link - ages in LOCI’s hypothesized theory of change , namely : ( 1 ) that improvement in clinic implementation leader - ship and transformational leadership contributes to sub - sequently improved clinic implementation climate , and ( 2 ) that improvement in clinic implementation climate explains LOCI’s effect on EBP fidelity . Fig . 1 Study theoretical model . Note : LOCI , Leadership and Organizational Change for Implementation strategy ; MBC , measurement‑based care . First‑level leaders are those who administratively supervise clinicians ( e . g . , clinical managers ) . Random assignment of clinics to LOCI ( vs . training and technical assistance only ) is expected to cause improvement in clinic‑level implementation leadership , transformational leadership , and implementation climate for digital MBC ( Aim 1 ) . Improvement in implementation leadership and transformational leadership is expected to mediate LOCI’s effect on improved clinic implementation climate ( Aim 2 ) . Improvement in clinic implementation climate is expected to mediate LOCI’s effect on improved fidelity to digital MBC as experienced by youth ( Aim 3 ) . In this study , the clinic level is synonymous with the organization level ; however , this is not always the case in applications of LOCI . The LOCI strategy can be applied to organizations with multiple levels , resulting in theoretical models that describe how LOCI intervenes at multiple organizational levels to influence climate Page 4 of 16 Williams et al . Implementation Science ( 2024 ) 19 : 29 Study contributions This study makes three contributions to the literature . In Aim 1 , we test LOCI’s effects on growth in first - level lead - ers’ use of implementation leadership ( Hypothesis 1 ) and transformational leadership ( Hypothesis 2 ) , and on clinic implementation climate for MBC ( Hypothesis 3 ) , from baseline to 18 - month post - baseline ( i . e . , 6 months after completion of LOCI ) . This aim seeks to replicate find - ings from an earlier trial [ 48 ] in which LOCI improved these outcomes in a different treatment setting ( mental health clinics within Norwegian health trusts ) , patient population ( adults ) , and set of EBPs ( trauma - focused assessment and psychotherapies ) . In Aim 2 , we test the hypotheses that experimentally induced improvement in first - level leaders’ implementation leadership ( Hypoth - esis 4 ) and transformational leadership ( Hypothesis 5 ) at T 2 ( 4 months after baseline ) will mediate LOCI’s effects on clinic implementation climate at T 4 ( 12 months after baseline ) . In Aim 3 , we test LOCI’s focal mechanism , namely : that improvement in clinic implementation cli - mate from pre - to post - LOCI ( i . e . , T 1 to T 4 ) will medi - ate LOCI’s effect on MBC fidelity during the same period ( Hypothesis 6 ) . We believe this is the first study to test whether experimentally induced improvement in clinic leadership contributes to improved implementation cli - mate and whether improvement in implementation cli - mate improves observed fidelity to an EBP . Method Study design and procedure Project WISDOM was a cluster randomized , con - trolled , hybrid type III effectiveness - implementation trial designed to test the effects of LOCI versus training and technical assistance only on MBC fidelity in outpa - tient mental health clinics serving youth . Details of the trial and primary implementation and clinical outcomes are reported elsewhere [ 12 ] . The trial enrolled 21 clin - ics serving youth in Idaho , Oregon , and Nevada , USA . Clinics were eligible if they were not actively implement - ing a digital MBC system and if they employed three or more clinicians delivering psychotherapy to youth ( ages 4 – 18 years ) . Using covariate constrained randomiza - tion , clinics were randomly assigned to one of two paral - lel arms : ( 1 ) LOCI plus training and technical assistance in MBC or ( 2 ) training and technical assistance in MBC only . Clinic - level randomization aligned with the scope of the LOCI strategy and prevented contamination of outcomes at the clinician and patient levels . Clinic lead - ers could not be naïve to condition ; however , clinicians and caregivers of youth were naïve to condition . Following baseline assessments and randomization of clinics , executives and first - level leaders in the LOCI con - dition began participating in the LOCI implementation strategy . One month later , clinicians who worked with youths in both conditions received training to imple - ment an evidence - based digital MBC system called the Outcome Questionnaire - Analyst ( OQ - A ; see below for details ; [ 49 , 50 ] ) . Following the initial OQ - A training , clinics in both conditions received two booster trainings and ongoing OQ - A technical assistance from the OQ - A purveyor organization until the trial’s conclusion . To assess LOCI’s effects on its targeted mechanisms of change , clinicians who served youth in participating clinics were asked to complete web - based assessments evaluating their clinic’s leadership and clinic implemen - tation climate for MBC at five time points : baseline ( T 1 ; following randomization of clinics but prior to initiation of LOCI or OQ - A training ) , 4 - month post - baseline ( T 2 ) , 8 - month post - baseline ( T 3 ) , 12 - month post - baseline ( T 4 ; coinciding with the conclusion of LOCI ) , and 18 - month post - baseline ( T 5 ; 6 months after LOCI concluded ) . Surveys were administered from October 2019 to May 2021 . Clinic leaders provided the research team with rosters and emails of all youth - serving clinicians at each time point . Confidential survey links were distributed by the research team directly to clinicians via email . Clini - cians received a small financial incentive for completion of each assessment ( i . e . , gift card to a national retailer ) based on an escalating structure ( US $ 30 , US $ 30 , US $ 45 , US $ 50 , US $ 55 ) . The primary implementation outcome of MBC fidel - ity was assessed for new youth outpatients who initiated treatment in the 12 months following clinician training in the MBC system . Upon intake to services , parents / caregivers of new youth patients were presented with study information requesting their consent for con - tact by the research team . Caregivers who agreed were contacted by research staff via telephone to complete screening , informed consent , and baseline measures ( if eligible ) . After study entry , caregivers completed assess - ments reporting on the youth’s treatment participation ( i . e . , number of sessions ) and symptoms monthly for 6 months following the youth’s baseline . Assessments were completed regardless of the youth’s continued par - ticipation in treatment , unless the caregiver formally withdrew ( n = 7 ) . Caregivers received a US $ 15 gift card to a national retailer for completion of each assessment . Enrollment and collection of follow - up data for youth occurred from January 2020 to July 2021 . The CONSORT and Stari guidelines were used to report the results of this mediation analysis within the larger trial [ 51 , 52 ] . Participants All licensed clinicians who worked with youth in par - ticipating clinics at each time point were eligible to par - ticipate in web - based surveys of clinic leadership and Page 5 of 16 Williams et al . Implementation Science ( 2024 ) 19 : 29 climate . This broad inclusion criterion ensured a full pic - ture of clinic leadership and climate at each time point . Inclusion criteria for youth were intentionally broad to reflect the trial’s pragmatic nature and the applicability of MBC to a wide range of mental health diagnoses . Eli - gible youth were new patients ( i . e . , no psychotherapy at the clinic in the prior 12 months ) , ages 4 to 17 years , who had been diagnosed by clinic staff with an Axis I DSM disorder deemed appropriate for outpatient treatment at the clinic ; it was not required that youths be assigned to clinicians who completed surveys . Youths were excluded if they initiated treatment more than 7 days before the informed consent interview . Electronic informed con - sent was obtained from all participants . The Boise State University Institutional Review Board provided over - sight for the trial ( protocol no . 041 ‐ SB19 ‐ 081 ) which was prospectively registered at ClinicalTrials . gov ( identifier : NCT04096274 ) . Clinical intervention : digital measurement‑based care The OQ - A is a digital MBC system shown to improve the effectiveness of mental health services in over a dozen clinical trials across four countries [ 49 , 53 ] . OQ - A meas - ures are sensitive to change upon weekly administration and designed to detect treatment progress regardless of treatment protocol , patient diagnosis , or clinician dis - cipline [ 53 ] . In this study , clinicians had access to par - ent - and youth - report forms of the Youth Outcomes Questionnaire 30 . 2 [ 54 , 55 ] and the Treatment Support Measure [ 56 , 57 ] . Measures were completed by caregivers and / or youth electronically ( via tablet or phone ) . Admin - istration typically took 3 – 5 min . Measures were automat - ically scored by the OQ - A system , and feedback reports were generated within seconds . Feedback included a graph of change in the youth’s symptoms , critical items ( e . g . , feelings of aggression ) , and a color - coded alert , gen - erated by an empirical algorithm , indicating whether the youth was making expected progress or was at risk of negative treatment outcome . Clinicians were instructed to administer a youth symp - tom measure to the caregiver and / or youth at each ses - sion , review the feedback within 7 days of the session , and use the feedback to guide clinical decision - making . Clinicians were encouraged to discuss feedback with the caregiver and / or youth when they believed it was clini - cally appropriate and to administer a Treatment Support Measure if a youth was identified as high risk for nega - tive outcome . Consistent with prior MBC trials , clini - cians were not given specific guidance on how to respond to feedback ; instead , they were advised to use their clinical skills in partnership with patients and clinical supervisors . Implementation strategies OQ‑A training and technical assistance The initial , 6 - h , OQ - A training provided to clinicians in both conditions was conducted in - person by the OQ - A purveyor organization . Training focused on the concep - tual and psychometric foundations of the measures , the value of clinical feedback , clinical application of meas - ures and feedback with youth and families , and technical usage of the system . Learning activities included didac - tics , in vivo modeling and behavioral rehearsal , exercises with sample feedback reports , and use of the system in “playground mode . ” Two , live , virtual , 1 - h booster train - ings were offered to clinicians 3 and 5 months after the initial training . Professional continuing education hours were offered at no cost for all trainings to encour - age participation . After the initial training , all clinics in both conditions received year - round technical assistance from the OQ - A purveyor organization . This included on - demand virtual training sessions , an online library of training videos , and a customer care representative to troubleshoot technical issues . Leadership and Organizational Change for Implementation ( LOCI ) Details of the LOCI implementation strategy are avail - able elsewhere [ 11 , 12 ] . Briefly , LOCI was implemented in quarterly cycles over 12 months . During each cycle , ( 1 ) executives and first - level leaders within LOCI clin - ics attended monthly organizational strategy meetings to review data and to develop clinic - wide policies , pro - cedures , and practices to support OQ - A implementation , and ( 2 ) first - level leaders attended leadership develop - ment trainings ( 5 days total ) and participated in brief ( ~ 15 min ) weekly coaching calls , designed to enhance their leadership skills . Once per month , individual coach - ing calls were replaced by group coaching calls with all other first - level leaders in the LOCI condition . To support enrollment in the study , clinic leaders in the training and technical assistance only condition were offered access to four , professionally produced , web - based , general leadership seminars ( 1 h each ) . Seminars covered general leadership topics like giving effective feedback and leading change . The seminars were made available immediately after the OQ - A training . Measures MBC fidelity The primary outcome of MBC fidelity was measured at the youth level using an empirically validated MBC fidelity index [ 22 , 58 , 59 ] . The index was generated using electronic metadata from the OQ - A system com - bined with monthly caregiver reports of the number of Page 6 of 16 Williams et al . Implementation Science ( 2024 ) 19 : 29 sessions youths attended . Following prior research [ 22 ] , scores were calculated as the product of two quantities : ( a ) the youth’s completion rate ( i . e . , number of measures administered relative to the number of sessions attended within the 6 - month observation period ) and ( b ) the youth’s viewing rate ( i . e . , the number of feedback reports viewed by the clinician relative to the number of meas - ures administered ) . Note that this product is equivalent to the ratio of viewed feedback reports to total sessions ; it represents an events / trials proportion . MBC fidelity index scores summarize the level of MBC fidelity experi - enced by each youth ( range = 0 – 1 ) and have been shown to predict clinical improvement of youths receiving MBC [ 22 , 58 , 59 ] . Importantly , this index captures the admin - istration and viewing components of MBC fidelity but does not indicate whether clinicians used the feedback to guide treatment . Implementation leadership Clinicians assessed the extent to which their first - level leaders exhibited implementation leadership behaviors with regard to the OQ - A using the 12 - item Implemen - tation Leadership Scale ( ILS ) [ 40 ] . The ILS includes four subscales assessing the extent to which the first - level leader is proactive , knowledgeable , supportive , and perseverant about implementation . Responses were made on a 0 ( not at all ) to 4 ( very great extent ) scale . Total scores were calculated as the mean of all items . In prior research , scores on the ILS exhibited excel - lent internal consistency , convergent and discriminant validity [ 40 , 47 , 60 , 61 ] , and sensitivity to change [ 45 ] . Transformational leadership Clinicians assessed the extent to which their first - level leaders exhibited transformational leadership behaviors using the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire ( MLQ ) [ 62 , 63 ] . The MLQ is a widely used measure that has demonstrated excellent psychometric properties [ 64 ] and is associated with implementation climate for EBP as well as clinicians’ attitudes toward , and use of , EBPs [ 65 – 68 ] . Responses were made on a 5 - point scale ( “not at all” to “frequently , if not always” ) . Consistent with prior stud - ies , we used the 20 - item transformational leadership total score , calculated as the mean of four subscales : idealized influence , inspirational motivation , intellectual stimula - tion , and individual consideration . Clinic implementation climate Clinicians’ perceptions of their clinics’ implemen - tation climate for OQ - A were measured using the 18 - item Implementation Climate Scale ( ICS ) [ 34 ] . The ICS includes six subscales assessing focus , educational support , recognition , rewards , selection , and openness . Responses were made on a 0 ( not at all ) to 4 ( a very great extent ) scale with the total score calculated as the mean of all items . Prior research provides evidence for the structural , convergent , and discriminant validity of scores on the ICS [ 27 , 34 , 69 – 72 ] as well as sensitivity to change [ 45 ] . Data aggregation Best practice guidelines [ 73 – 76 ] recommend clinician rat - ings of first - level leadership and clinic implementation climate be aggregated and analyzed at the clinic level . To justify aggregation , guidelines recommend that research - ers test the level of inter - rater agreement among clinicians within each clinic to confirm there is evidence of shared experience . We used the r wg ( j ) statistic [ 77 ] to assess inter - rater agreement among clinicians within each clinic . Across all clinics and all waves , average values of r wg ( j ) were above the recommended cutoff of 0 . 7 [ 78 , 79 ] for implementation leadership ( M = 0 . 82 , SD = 0 . 27 ) , trans - formational leadership ( M = 0 . 87 , SD = 0 . 24 ) , and clinic implementation climate ( M = 0 . 94 , SD = 0 . 10 ) . Covariates In order to increase statistical power and to address potential imbalance across clusters , we planned a priori to include covariates of state and clinic size ( number of youths served in the prior year ) in all analyses . In addi - tion , in the mediation analyses described below , we included baseline values of the hypothesized mediator and outcome ( when possible ) to increase the plausibility of the no - unmeasured - confounding assumptions within the causal mediation approach [ 80 , 81 ] . Data analysis All analyses used an intent - to - treat approach . To test LOCI’s effects on growth in first - level leaders’ imple - mentation leadership ( H1 ) , transformational leadership ( H2 ) , and clinic implementation climate ( H3 ) for Aim 1 , we used three - level linear mixed - effects regression mod - els [ 82 , 83 ] with random effects addressing the nesting of repeated observations ( level 1 ) within clinicians ( level 2 ) within clinics ( level 3 ) . Separate models were estimated for each outcome . At level 1 , observations of leadership and climate collected from clinicians at each time point were modeled using a piecewise growth function that captured differences in change from baseline to each time point across conditions [ 84 ] . Implementation condi - tion and clinic covariates were entered at level 3 . Models were estimated using the mixed command in Stata 17 . 0 [ 85 ] under full maximum likelihood estimation , which accounts for missing data on the outcomes , assum - ing data are missing at random . Effect sizes were calcu - lated as the standardized mean difference in change ( i . e . , Page 7 of 16 Williams et al . Implementation Science ( 2024 ) 19 : 29 difference in differences ) from baseline to each time point ( i . e . , Cohen’s d ) using formulas by Feingold [ 86 ] . Cohen suggested values of d could be interpreted as small ( 0 . 2 ) , medium ( 0 . 5 ) , and large ( 0 . 8 ) [ 87 ] . Aim 2 tested the hypotheses that experimentally induced improvement in first - level leaders’ implemen - tation leadership ( H4 ) , and transformational leadership ( H5 ) by T 2 , would mediate LOCI’s effect on improvement in clinic implementation climate by T 4 . These media - tion hypotheses were tested using the multilevel causal mediation approach by Imai et al . [ 81 ] , implemented in the R “mediation” package [ 88 ] . To align our analytic approach with our theoretical model , we estimated a 2 – 2 - 1 mediation model in which the primary anteced - ent ( LOCI ) and mediator ( clinic - level aggregate leader - ship scores ) entered the model at level 2 ( i . e . , the clinic level ) , and the outcome ( clinician ratings of implementa - tion climate ) entered at level 1 , representing latent clinic means [ 89 ] . Separate models were estimated for each type of leadership because Imai’s approach does not accommodate simultaneous mediators [ 81 ] . The inclu - sion of baseline values for the mediator ( i . e . , leadership ) and outcome ( i . e . , climate ) in each model modified the interpretation of the effects so that they represented the effect of LOCI on change in leadership from T 1 to T 2 and of change in leadership on change in climate from T 1 to T 4 . To stabilize the effect estimates , we set the number of analytic simulations for the direct and indirect effects to 10 , 000 . These analyses produced estimates of LOCI’s indirect and direct effects on T 4 implementation climate , as well as the proportion of LOCI’s total effect on imple - mentation climate that was mediated by improvement in leadership ( i . e . , proportion mediated = p m ) . Indirect effects indicate the extent to which LOCI influenced T 4 implementation climate through its effect on T 2 leader - ship ( i . e . , mediation ) . Direct effects indicate the residual ( remaining ) effect of LOCI on T 4 implementation climate that was not explained by change in T 2 leadership . The p m statistic is an effect size measure indicating how much of LOCI’s effect on implementation climate was explained by change in leadership . Aim 3 tested the hypothesis that improvement in clinic implementation climate from T 1 to T 4 would medi - ate LOCI’s effect on MBC fidelity during the same time period ( H6 ) . The nested data structure was accommo - dated using a 2 – 2 - 1 model in which the primary ante - cedent ( LOCI ) and mediator ( aggregate clinic - level T 4 implementation climate scores ) occurred at level 2 ( i . e . , clinic level ) and the outcome ( MBC fidelity ) occurred at level 1 ( i . e . , youth level ) . Note that the inclusion of base - line values of clinic implementation climate in this model modified the interpretation of the effects so that they represent the effect of LOCI on change in climate from T 1 to T 4 and of change in climate on fidelity during the same time period . To address the events / trials nature of the MBC fidelity index , a generalized linear mixed - effects model with random clinic intercepts , a binomial response distribution , and a logit link function was used in the second step of the mediation analysis [ 82 ] . In total , 18 clinics enrolled a total of 234 youth , all of whom had MBC fidelity data ; however , one clinic was missing rat - ings of T 4 implementation climate , resulting in a sample of 17 clinics and 231 youth for this analysis . A sensitiv - ity analysis based on mean imputation of the missing T 4 implementation climate value yielded the same inferen - tial conclusions . A priori statistical power analyses con - ducted with the PowerUp ! macro [ 90 , 91 ] indicated the trial had power of 0 . 74 – 0 . 90 to detect minimally mean - ingful mediation effect sizes depending on observed intraclass correlation coefficients and variance explained by covariates . Results Figure 2 shows the flow of clinics , clinicians , and youth through the study . As is shown in Table 1 , there were no differences by condition on the distribution of any clinic ( K = 21 ) , clinician ( N = 252 ) , or youth ( N = 231 ) char - acteristics ( all p s > 0 . 05 ) . In total , 252 clinicians com - pleted assessments for the study across 5 waves ( average response rate = 88 % across waves ) . The average number of participating clinicians per clinic was 12 ( SD = 6 . 4 ) . Nearly two - thirds of clinicians ( n = 154 , 61 % ) participated in 3 or more waves of data collection , and there were no differences by condition on clinician participation pat - terns ( p = 0 . 114 ) . A total of 234 youths were enrolled in the study . The average number of youths per clinic was 13 . 6 ( SD = 13 . 3 ) . The average number of assessments completed per youth was 5 . 9 ( SD = 1 . 8 ) out of 7 ; 64 % ( n = 148 ) of youth had complete data , and 90 % ( n = 208 ) had 3 or more completed assessments . There were no differences in caregiver response rates for youth data by condition ( p = 0 . 557 ) .

Com - pared to clinicians in control clinics , clinicians in LOCI reported significantly greater increases in their first - level leaders’ use of implementation leadership behaviors from baseline to 4 months ( b = 1 . 27 , SE = 0 . 18 , p < 0 . 001 ) , 8 months ( b = 1 . 46 , SE = 0 . 22 , p < 0 . 001 ) , 12 months ( b = 1 . 28 , SE = 0 . 27 , p < 0 . 001 ) , and 18 months ( b = 1 . 07 , SE = 0 . 37 , p = 0 . 003 ) .

As is shown in Table 2 , LOCI’s effects on implementa - tion leadership were large at all follow - up points , includ - ing 4 - , 8 - , 12 - , and 18 - month post - baseline ( range of d = 0 . 97 to 1 . 34 ) . Hypothesis 2 stated that growth in first - level leaders’ transformational leadership would be superior in LOCI clinics relative to control . This hypothesis was partially supported ( see Fig . 3 and Table 2 ) . Clinicians in LOCI reported significantly greater growth in their first - level leaders’ use of transformational leadership behaviors from baseline to 4 months ( b = 0 . 31 , SE = 0 . 13 , p = 0 . 019 ) ; however , this difference disappeared at 8 months ( b = 0 . 27 , SE = 0 . 14 , p = 0 . 061 ) and was not evident at 12 months ( b = 0 . 21 , SE = 0 . 16 , p = 0 . 191 ) or 18 months ( b = 0 . 15 , SE = 0 . 19 , p = 0 . 438 ) . Hypothesis 3 stated growth in clinic implementation climate would be superior in LOCI clinics relative to control . This hypothesis was supported . Relative to clini - cians in control , clinicians in LOCI reported significantly greater increases in their clinics’ implementation cli - mate for MBC at 4 months ( b = 0 . 56 , SE = 0 . 10 , p < 0 . 001 ) , 8 months ( b = 0 . 71 , SE = 0 . 11 , p < 0 . 001 ) , 12 months ( b = 0 . 55 , SE = 0 . 12 , p < 0 . 001 ) , and 18 months ( b = 0 . 43 , SE = 0 . 15 , p = 0 . 005 ) . Table 2 shows that these effects were large during the intervention period and at posttest ( i . e . , at 4 - , 8 - , and 12 - month post - baseline ; d ranged from 0 . 98 to 1 . 25 ) and slightly attenuated at 18 - month follow - up ( d = 0 . 76 ) . Indirect effects of LOCI on T 4 implementation climate through T 2 clinic leadership Hypotheses 4 and 5 examined how LOCI improved T 4 clinic implementation climate by testing media - tion models . Hypothesis 4 stated LOCI would have an indirect effect on T 4 implementation climate through improvement in first - level leaders’ use of implementa - tion leadership from T 1 to T 2 . As is shown in Table 3 , this hypothesis was supported .

The proportion - mediated statistic indicated 82 % of LOCI’s total effect on clinic implementation climate at T 4 was explained by improvement in implementation lead - ership from T 1 to T 2 ( p m = 0 . 82 ) . Hypothesis 5 stated LOCI would have an indirect effect on T 4 implementation climate through improvement in first - level leaders’ transformational leadership . This hypoth - esis was not supported ( see Table 3 ) . There was no evidence of an indirect effect of LOCI through transformational leadership ( indirect effect = 0 . 16 , p = 0 . 135 ) even as LOCI’s direct effect on T 4 implementation climate remained statis - tically significant ( direct effect = 0 . 38 , p = 0 . 024 ) . This pat - tern confirms LOCI improved T 4 implementation climate but not through its effect on transformational leadership . Indirect effect of LOCI on MBC fidelity through implementation climate Hypothesis 6 stated that LOCI’s effect on clinic imple - mentation climate from T 1 to T 4 would mediate LOCI’s effect on MBC fidelity measured at the youth level during the same time period . As is shown in Table 3 , results of the mediation analysis supported this hypoth - esis . The LOCI strategy had a statistically significant indirect effect on MBC fidelity through clinic imple - mentation climate , increasing fidelity by 14 percent - age points ( indirect effect = 0 . 14 , 95 % CI = 0 . 01 – 0 . 37 , p = 0 . 033 ) through this mechanism . The direct effect of LOCI on fidelity after accounting for clinic implemen - tation climate was not statistically significant ( direct effect = 0 . 05 , p = 0 . 482 ) . The proportion - mediated sta - tistic indicated 71 % of LOCI’s effect on MBC fidelity was explained by improvement in clinic implementa - tion climate from T 1 to T 4 ( p m = 0 . 71 , p = 0 . 045 ) .

Implementation Science ( 2024 ) 19 : 29 Discussion This study is the first to experimentally test the hypoth - eses that ( a ) increases in first - level leaders’ use of imple - mentation leadership and transformational leadership improve clinic implementation climate , and ( b ) improve - ment in clinic implementation climate contributes to improved fidelity to an EBP . As such , it represents an important step in advancing recommendations for rigor - ous tests of mechanisms and causal theory in implemen - tation science [ 73 , 92 ] . Results support the hypotheses that ( a ) first - level leaders can help generate clinic imple - mentation climates for a specific EBP through the use of implementation leadership behaviors , and ( b ) first - level leaders and organization executives can improve fidelity to EBP by developing focused implementation climates in their organizations . In this trial , increases in first - level leaders’ use of imple - mentation leadership by 4 - month post - baseline explained 82 % of LOCI’s effect on improvement in clinic imple - mentation climate by 12 - month post - baseline . This find - ing aligns with qualitative data from another recent trial of MBC implementation in community mental health [ 93 ] , which also found that leader and clinical supervisor support for MBC were perceived as key implementation mechanisms . The linkage of implementation leadership to improvement in clinic implementation climate sug - gests implementation leadership behaviors are impor - tant targets for implementation success . Accordingly , pre - service educational programs for health leaders , implementation purveyor organizations , and other stake - holders interested in supporting EBP implementation should consider integrating these leadership competen - cies into core curricula and training . Contrary to our hypotheses ( see Fig . 1 ) , LOCI did not exert lasting effects on transformational leadership , and increases in transformational leadership did not explain LOCI’s effect on improvement in clinic implementa - tion climate . This pattern of results aligns with theoreti - cal models of leadership and climate which suggest that specific types of focused leadership ( i . e . , implementation leadership [ 40 ] ) are needed to generate specific types of focused organizational climate and associated outcomes [ 37 , 44 ] . This finding also suggests the LOCI strategy could be streamlined without loss of efficacy by scaling back ( or eliminating ) components that address transfor - mational leadership , as has been done in implementa - tion studies of autism interventions [ 94 ] . Streamlining the content of LOCI may increase LOCI’s feasibility and allow for greater development of implementation leader - ship skills . Improvement in clinic implementation climate explained 71 % of LOCI’s effect on youth - level MBC fidel - ity . The validation of this theoretical linkage within an experimental design lends credence to prior correlational studies and theory suggesting clinic implementation cli - mate can contribute to improved EBP implementation in mental health settings [ 27 , 44 – 47 ] . These results sug - gest organizational and system leaders can improve the implementation of EBPs by deploying organizational pol - icies , procedures , and practices that send clear signals to clinicians about the importance of EBP implementation relative to competing priorities within practice settings . Discussions about change in organizational leadership and organizational climate often center around how long it takes for these constructs to change and what level of resources are required . Results from this trial suggest changes in first - level leadership and clinic implementa - tion climate can occur quickly , within 4 months , and that these changes can be lasting , even 6 months after sup - ports ( i . e . , LOCI ) are removed . A similarly brief time - frame for initial change , and similarly sustained period of maintenance of effect , was observed for implementation leadership and climate in the other large trial of LOCI , which occurred in a different country , patient population , and EBP [ 48 ] . Together , results from these trials confirm implementation leadership and implementation climate are modifiable with a combination of training , weekly coaching calls , data feedback , and goal setting . This study highlights multiple directions for future research . Future studies should examine moderators of LOCI’s effectiveness with an eye toward the minimally necessary components to make LOCI effective . For example , there is some evidence that intervention com - plexity moderates the association between implemen - tation climate and fidelity [ 47 ] . This is consistent with organizational climate theory , which indicates climate is most strongly related to employee behaviors when ser - vice complexity is higher [ 95 ] and when there is high interdependence among employees to complete tasks and high intangibility of the service provided [ 96 ] . Other research should look beyond the organization level at how systems can be modified in complementary ways to create supportive implementation climates for targeted interventions . Strengths of this study include the use of an experimen - tal , longitudinal design , enrollment of clinics in diverse policy environments ( i . e . , three different States ) , meas - urement of leadership and climate by third - party inform - ants whose behavior is most salient to implementation success ( i . e . , clinicians ) , measurement of MBC fidelity through objective computer - generated data , time order - ing of hypothesized antecedents and consequents , and use of rigorous causal mediation models to estimate direct and indirect effects . The study’s primary limitation is generalizability given all clinics and caregivers of youth volunteered to participate . In addition , the MBC fidelity Page 14 of 16 Williams et al . Implementation Science ( 2024 ) 19 : 29 measure does not assess whether clinicians used the feed - back to inform clinical decisions . Data were not collected on other mechanisms that may explain LOCI’s effects , a gap that may be fruitfully addressed by future qualitative research . Because the LOCI condition included training and technical assistance , it was not possible to isolate LOCI’s independent effects ; this is also a fruitful area for future research . Finally , we were unable to fully test LOCI’s hypothesized theory of change due to our use of the causal mediation approach which precludes testing serial multiple mediator models ( e . g . , LOCI → leader - ship → climate → fidelity ) . Nonetheless , our results con - firm the most consequential links in LOCI’s theoretical model and offer important directions for research and practice . Conclusion In this mediation analysis of the WISDOM trial , experi - mentally induced improvement in implementation lead - ership explained increases in clinic implementation climate , which in turn explained LOCI’s effects on MBC fidelity in youth mental health services . This offers strong evidence that fidelity to EBPs can be improved by devel - oping organizational leaders and strong implementation climates .
