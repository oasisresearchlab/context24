Exosomes have now been identified to carry cell - specific cargo of nucleic acids , proteins , lipids , and other biologically active molecules . Exosomes can be selectively taken up by neighboring or distant cells , which has shown to result in structural and functional responses in the recipient cells . Recent advances indicate the regulation of exosomes at various steps , including their biogenesis , selection of their cargo , as well as cell - specific uptake . This review will shed light on the differences between the type of extracellular vesicles . In this review , we discuss the recent progress in our understanding of the regulation of exosome biogenesis , secretion , and uptake . Keywords Extracellular vesicles · Exosomes · Intercellular communication · Biogenesis · Secretion Background Communication is an essential biological feature that facilitates cell – cell signaling and ensures the maintenance of homeostasis or response to stimuli in stress conditions . Identified as pro - coagulant ‘dust’ from blood platelets by Wolf ( 1967 ) , extracellular vesicles ( EVs ) represent an evo - lutionarily conserved group of heterogeneous vesicles that are vital in intercellular communication in prokaryotes as well as eukaryote [ 1 ] . Surrounded by the lipid bilayer , EVs can be derived from healthy or diseased cells upon activa - tion and apoptosis [ 2 – 5 ] . These cell - derived vesicles mediate intercellular communication via transporting cargo , which can influence and alter the function of the recipient cells . EVs have shown to deliver the molecular cargo to target cells by binding to receptors on the cell surface , fusion with the plasma membrane , or endocytosis [ 6 , 7 ] , although our understanding regarding these uptake methods is still evolving . Depending on the size , mechanisms of biogen - esis , secretion , surface markers , and physiological function , EVs are broadly classified into exosomes , microvesicles , and apoptotic bodies [ 8 ] . Although the field of EVs is still in its infancy , it has seen exceptional progress in recent years . Accumulating evidence suggests a critical role of EVs in physiological and pathological processes which lead to heightened scientific and clinical interests in the field of EVs in the last decade . However , a number of important ques - tions remain unanswered : How is the rate of EV biogenesis and release regulated ? How is their cargo regulated ? What are the different EV subtype - specific markers which can be utilized to advance the technical aspects of the EV research field ? For the advancement of the EV research field , it is critical that the answers to these questions be found . This review provides an introduction into the types of EVs and primarily focuses on the smallest subtype of EVs termed as exosomes . Recent progress in our understanding of exo - some biogenesis , release , and uptake by the recipient cells is discussed in detail . Types of extracellular vesicles The EVs are a heterogeneous family of membrane - limited vesicles originating from the endosome or plasma mem - brane . Upon their identification , they were thought to be * Vaibhav B .

Subsequent research of the last several decades has shown that the release of EVs is also an essential mediator of intercellular communication that is involved in the normal physiological processes as well as in pathological progression . EVs are currently classified into microvesicles , apoptotic bodies , and exosomes , based on their size , mechanisms of biogenesis , secretion , surface markers , and physiological functions ( Table 1 ) [ 8 ] . Microvesicles The microvesicles ( also often termed as microparticles ) are a heterogeneous population of membrane vesicles ranging from 100 to 1000 nm in diameter ( Table 1 ) . Microvesicles can be released from various cell types such as platelets , erythrocytes , leukocytes , lymphocytes , endothelial cells , and vascular smooth muscle cells upon cell activation or apoptosis [ 9 , 10 ] . Microvesicles are formed by the outward blebbing of the cell membrane and , hence , involve the membrane remodeling leading to the distribution of phos - phatidylcholine and sphingomyelin on the outside and phos - phatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine on the inside of the microvesicle membrane [ 10 ] . An increase in intra - cellular calcium levels initiates the process of membrane remodeling , which results in rearrangement of membrane symmetry followed by phosphatidylserine externalization to the outer surface . Activation of calcium - sensitive enzymes promotes cleavage of cytoskeleton filaments resulting in the formation of blebs on the cell membrane and the release of microvesicles [ 11 – 13 ] . Microvesicles facilitate intercellular communications by two major mechanisms : first , by presenting bioactive mol - ecules present on its membrane to target cell receptors and affecting the cellular properties . Second , by directly transfer - ring the cargo contents to the target cells , microvesicles can promote cell activation and alter the function of target cells [ 9 , 14 ] . Microvesicles are widely characterized using flow cytometry for the presence of cell - specific surface markers along with phosphatidylserine ( detected by the annexin V antibody ) [ 12 , 13 , 15 ] ( Table 1 ) . Microvesicles carry various bioactive molecules , including growth factors , cytokines , chemokines , signaling proteins , enzymes , mRNAs , and miRNAs [ 14 , 16 ] . Transfer of these molecules from the cell of origin via microvesicles to target cell facilitate intercel - lular communication . Microvesicle - mediated intercellular communication has recently been identified to play a critical role in various physiological functions , including immunity , hemostasis , and angiogenesis [ 17 , 18 ] . Moreover , microves - icles are also implicated in pathophysiological conditions such as atherosclerosis , inflammation , vascular dysfunction , thrombosis , loss of pregnancy , preeclampsia , and sepsis [ 10 , 19 – 26 ] . We recommend various recent reviews for further reading on mechanisms involved in microvesicle biogenesis and cargo loading , release , and uptake , as well as their role in various biological functions [ 27 – 32 ] . Apoptotic bodies Apoptosis , a programmed mechanism of cell death , is char - acterized by cellular morphological alterations such as an increase in membrane permeability , cell contraction , chro - matin condensation , cytochrome c release , karyorrhexis , and subsequent Rho - associated kinase I ( ROCK ) and myo - sin ATPase - dependent release of apoptotic bodies [ 33 , 34 ] . With a diameter range of 1000 – 5000 nm , apoptotic bodies are the largest EVs that are released as blebs from the plasma membrane during the late stage of cellular apoptosis [ 35 ] .

Similar to microparticles , apoptotic bodies also carry phosphatidylserine on their outer membranes due to membrane externalization during the progression of apop - tosis [ 35 ] . In contrast to a regulated formation of exosomes and microvesicles during normal cellular processes in living cells , apoptotic bodies are released only during apoptotic cell death . Apoptotic bodies can be distinguished from other EVs based on their size as well as the presence of cell orga - nelles and nuclear material in their cargo [ 36 ] . Role as a signaling molecule for cellular clearance or the relative ease of phagocytosis compared to larger damaged cells is pro - posed as a probable explanation for the generation of apop - totic bodies during cell death [ 37 , 38 ] . Even though specific functions of apoptotic bodies are still under investigation , apoptotic bodies are implicated in the transfer of oncogenes [ 39 ] , DNA [ 40 ] , immuno - suppression [ 41 ] , and intercellular communication . We recommend a comprehensive review of EVs for further reading on apoptotic bodies and their role in intercellular communication [ 42 ] . Exosomes Described in the early 1980s as vesicles containing 5 ′ - nucle - otidase activity [ 43 ] , exosomes represent the smallest sub - group of EVs ranging from 30 to 100 nm in size and float at a density of 1 . 13 – 1 . 19 g / mL on a sucrose gradient ( Table 1 ) . Exosomes originate from intraluminal vesicles formed by inward budding of the membrane of multivesicular bodies ( MVB ) . MVBs either lead to proteolytic degradation by fusion with lysosomes or are released as exosomes in the extracellular environment after fusion with the cell mem - brane [ 44 – 46 ] . Different sorting processes involved in the generation of exosomes decide the fate of MVB , i . e . , fusion with lysosomes for the degradation or release of intraluminal vesicles in the extracellular environment . Recycling of mul - tiple receptors between cell surface , endosome , and trans - Golgi network is regulated by the endosomal system via the control of various molecules of the extracellular environ - ment . Thus , the exosomal content signifies the cellular origin of EVs and the physiological state of the cell [ 47 ] . Exosomes can be generated in response to stimuli or con - stitutively by various cells [ 35 , 48 ] . In vivo , exosomes can be found in body fluids such as plasma , urine , breast milk , and cerebrovascular fluid [ 49 ] . Exosomes are characterized by exosome - specific markers that are incorporated during their biogenesis such as membrane proteins tetraspanins ( CD9 , CD63 , CD81 , and CD82 ) , Tumor Necrosis Factor Recep - tor 1 ( TNFR1 ) , GPI - anchored Proteins [ 50 ] , Alix , flotation , and TSG101 . Exosomes contain proteins which facilitate their various functions such as cell invasion and fusion ( tetraspanins : CD81 , CD63 , and CD9 ) , MVB biogenesis - associated proteins ( Alix , TSG101 , and clathrin ) , docking and membrane fusion ( RABs , ARF ) , and heat shock proteins ( Hsp90 , Hsp70 , and Hsp60 ) [ 51 , 52 ] . Due to the advance - ment of technology , once considered inert debris , various functional attributes of exosomes , including carrier vector for transfer of genetic material , gene expression regulation [ 53 ] , immune system modulation [ 54 ] , and mode of inter - cellular communication in the healthy and diseased state have been elucidated . Still detailed and focused scientific investigations are warranted to unravel the hidden potential of exosomes . Contents of exosome cargo Once thought to be cell debris and disposal mechanism , exosomes are now known to carry a distinct molecular cargo . In recent years , extensive research has been carried out to identify the contents of exosomal cargo . This has resulted in the formation of various databases , including Exocarta , Vesiclepedia , and EVpedia . These databases include infor - mation on the EV cargo ( proteins , miRNAs , mRNAs , and lipids ) along with the record of EV isolation and charac - terization methods used . Along with the exosome surface markers listed above , exosomes carry biomolecules such as mRNA , non - coding RNA ( miRNA and long non - coding RNA ) [ 55 – 58 ] , cytokines , metabolic enzymes , annexin , and growth factors [ 48 , 59 ] which contribute to the physi - ological and pathological function of exosomes ( Fig . 1 ) . [ 27 , 60 ] . Importantly , recent studies also identified the presence of mitochondrial DNA as well as mitochondria organelle in the exosomes derived from myeloid - derived regulatory cells , which may have potential implications in intercellular communication in inflammation [ 61 ] . Of these cargo bio - molecules , miRNAs have been extensively studied for their role in exosomal intercellular communication [ 62 – 65 ] . Role of exosomal miRNAs has been established in various dis - eases , including atherosclerosis , myocardial infarction , vari - ous cancer pathologies , and numerous other diseases [ 62 , 64 , 66 – 68 ] . We recommend further reading on exosomal trafficking , miRNA packaging , and their biological function [ 62 , 63 , 65 ] . Biogenesis and mechanisms of secretion of exosomes Biogenesis of exosomes is a multistep biological process regulated via various signaling pathways , which represent the complexity of exosomes in terms of their composition , cargo molecules , and sorted proteins . Though the exact mechanism for the biogenesis of exosome remains to be elu - cidated , different sorting mechanisms have been identified . 80 Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry ( 2020 ) 467 : 77 – 94 1 3 The two widely explained pathways for protein sorting for the biogenesis of exosomes are endosomal sorting complex transport ( ESCRT ) - dependent pathway [ 69 ] and ESCRT - independent pathway [ 70 – 72 ] . Biogenesis of exosomes initiates with the formation of early endosomes by inward budding of the cell membrane followed by second inward budding of the endosomal mem - brane . The second inward budding results in the formation of late endosome ( intraluminal vesicles ) . Late endosomes comprising intraluminal vesicles ( ILV ) are identified as MVBs [ 50 , 73 , 74 ] . The MVBs either fuse with lysosomes for degradation [ 75 ] or follow the endocytic pathway for the generation of exosomes . During the endocytic process , the plasma membrane surface proteins are appropriated into the inner membrane of endocytic vesicles [ 76 ] . In the endoplas - mic reticulum , the plasma membrane intussuscepted with these sequestered cargoes gets sorted and finally processed in the Golgi complex into intraluminal vesicles [ 74 ] . In the final stage , i . e . , the release of intraluminal vesicles via the exocytotic pathway into extracellular space , the MVBs fuse with the plasma membrane and are released as exosomes ( Fig . 2 ) . The biogenesis of exosomes is shown to be affected by various endogenous molecules , including adiponectin / T - cadherin signaling and small GTPase Ral [ 77 , 78 ] as well as extrinsic factors , including the viral [ 79 ] and non - viral infections and microbial infections including gram - negative bacteria , gram - positive bacteria , Leishmania , and Trypano - soma cruzi [ 80 ] . ESCRT‑dependent mechanism The ESCRT - dependent mechanism is one of the best - characterized mechanisms for the biogenesis of exosomes . ESCRT machinery is comprised of approximately thirty proteins arranged into four proteins complexes , i . e . , ESCRT - 0 , - I , - II , and – III , along with associated proteins such as VPS4 , VTA1 , and ALIX [ 52 ] . Via its ubiquitin - interacting domains , ESCRT - 0 facilitates cargo cluster - ing and transfer and further recruitment of other protein complexes of ESCRT , such as ESCRT - I , ESCRT - II , and ESCRT - III , to the endosomal membrane [ 81 , 82 ] . ESCRT - I and ESCRT - II are responsible for the budding of the Fig . 1 Ultrastructure of exosomes showing composition and mem - brane orientation of exosomes .

Membrane invagination and forma - tion of intraluminal vesicles are facilitated by ESCRT - III - mediated polymeric filament formation and vesicle fission [ 83 , 84 ] . Accessory proteins , i . e . , VPS4 ATPase , play an essential role in dissociation and recycling of the ESCRT machinery [ 74 ] . Several reports corroborated the ESCRT - dependent mechanism for exosomes formation and release [ 85 , 86 ] . However , some of the studies contradicted the ESCRT - dependent mechanism and proposed the ESCRT - independent mechanism of intraluminal vesicle formation and exosome release [ 8 , 72 , 87 ] . While several studies reported the involvement of postsynaptic density protein , disk - large , zonulin I ( PDZ ) protein syntenin in the forma - tion of ILV , MVBs , and exosomes [ 69 , 88 ] , a study by Ghossoub et al . explained the role of cytoskeletal adapter molecules in modification and maintenance of vesicle morphology [ 89 ] . ESCRT - dependent formation of MVBs had been a critical feature of both lysosomal degradation and exosome biogen - esis . While the function of ESCRT complexes in lysoso - mal degradation via targeting mono - ubiquitylated proteins have been well established by various studies [ 90 – 93 ] , the involvement of ESCRT complexes in exosome biogenesis has recently been shown by proteomic studies confirming the presence of ESCRT components , TSG101 , and ALIX , in various cell - derived exosomes [ 94 , 95 ] ( Fig . 2 ) . A compo - nent of ESCRT - 0 , hepatocyte growth factor - regulated tyros - ine kinase substrate ( HRS ) , is involved in the recognition of Fig . 2 Mechanisms of exosome biogenesis and secretion . Exosome biogenesis initiates with the process of endocytosis . It involves inward budding of the cell membrane and encompasses bioactive molecules , leading to the formation of the endosome . Further , these molecules are sorted in smaller vesicles which bud from perim - eter membrane into endosome lumen forming multivesicular bodies ( MVBs ) . The MVBs either fuse with lysosome for degradation or fuse with the plasma membrane to release exosomes . The exosome formation from MVBs proceeds via ESCRT - dependent and ESCRT - independent pathways . Abbreviations : ESCRT endosomal sorting complex required for transport ; MVBs multivesicular bodies 82 Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry ( 2020 ) 467 : 77 – 94 1 3 mono - ubiquitylated cargo proteins and form a complex with Signal transducing adapter molecule 1 ( STAM1 ) , clathrin , and Eps15 . HRS then recruits the ESCRT - I complex through interaction with TSG101 . Subsequently , it leads to ESCRT - I - mediated recruitment of ESCRT - III [ 96 ] . Tamai et al . found reduced exosome release in HRS - deficient dendritic cells suggesting the role of ESCRT - 0 in exosome biogenesis and secretion [ 97 ] . Other studies further corroborated the role of ESCRT machinery in exosome biogenesis as decreased exo - some release was also observed in HGS - depleted HEK293 cells [ 98 ] and tumor cells [ 99 ] . Involvement of ESCRT machinery in exosome biogenesis and secretion was eluci - dated by studying the effect of RNAi silencing of different components of ESCRT complexes in major histocompat - ibility complex class II ( MHC II ) - expressing HeLa cells . Decreased production of MHC - II - containing exosomes was observed due to knockdown of HRS , STAM1 , or TSG101 [ 100 ] . In another study by Baietti et al . , syndecan heparan sulfate proteoglycans and their cytoplasmic adaptor syntenin have been implicated in the biogenesis of tumor cell exosomes by the interaction of syntenin with ESCRT - III - binding protein , ALIX [ 69 ] . Exosomes are characterized by the simultaneous presence of MVBs - enriched proteins CD63 and MHC class II . While decreased secretion of exosomes was observed due to silencing of ESCRT - 0 genes ( HGS , STAM1 ) and ESCRT - I gene ( TSG101 ) as well as reduced expression levels of MHC II and CD63 on the remaining secreted exosomes , inhibition of ESCRT - III accessory proteins ( VPS4B , VTA1 , CHMP4C , and ALIX ) resulted in increased secretion of exosomes . The depletion of ALIX by silencing of PDCD6IP resulted in increased expression of MHC II with unchanged levels of CD63 in MVBs , suggesting that ALIX depletion results in increased MHC II levels in intracellular MVBs and the sur - face of EVs without affecting the number of EVs secreted . Contrarily , the silencing of ALIX in primary dendritic cells ( DCs ) showed a decrease in the numbers of EVs secreted [ 100 ] . Interestingly , Giordano et al . recently discovered lep - tin as a potent modulator of exosome biogenesis , where the leptin / leptin receptor / Hsp90 axis played an essential role as a regulator of exosome generation in mammary carcinoma cells , which was primarily mediated by increased expression of TSG101 , a key component of ESCRT - 1 [ 101 ] . Results from several studies elucidating the role of ESCRT proteins in exosome biogenesis showed heterogene - ity in the observations suggesting mechanistic and molecular diversity in the biogenesis of EVs from different cell - origin . ALIX depletion in skeletal muscle cell line ( C2C12 ) showed increased EV - associated Heat shock cognate 70 ( HSC70 ) secretion , but reduced CD63 secretion [ 102 ] , whereas exo - some - associated release of GPI - anchored proteolipid protein ( PLP ) in an oligodendroglial cell line was found to be inde - pendent of TSG101 , VPS4 , and ALIX [ 70 ] . The depletion of ALIX or TSG101 selectively affected the release of anthrax toxin - containing exosomes without impairing flotillin - con - taining exosomes [ 103 ] . While studies showed decreased exosome secretion in DCs , HeLa cells [ 100 ] , and MCF7 breast tumor cells [ 69 ] due to depletion of TSG101 , discrep - ant levels of exosome secretion were observed in different cell types by depletion of VPS4B . A similar discrepancy was also observed with ALIX depletion resulting in reduced exosome secretion from MCF7 and DCs , but not in HeLa cells [ 69 , 100 ] . Even though the ESCRT - dependent mechanism for bio - genesis has been well characterized , its relationship with the sorting of cargo molecules into MVBs is still being investigated . The ubiquitination of MHC II molecules has been identified as an essential feature in immature dendritic cells for endocytosis and sorting of MHC II molecules at MVBs into ILVs [ 104 ] . Contrarily , Buschow et al . identified a ubiquitination - independent mechanism of MHC II sorting to exosome by incorporation of MHC II into large detergent - resistant protein complexes together with CD9 in dendritic cells [ 102 ] . Importantly , the knockdown of TSG101 and STAM1 in HeLa cell lines resulted in decreased amounts of vesicle - associated MHC II and CD63 on EVs , suggest - ing another mechanism of ESCRT - dependent sorting of cargo molecules mediated by TSG101 and STAM1 [ 100 ] . Additionally , chaperone HSC70 was found to be involved in YTRFSLARQV sequence - specific binding of transmem - brane protein Transferrin Receptor ( TfR ) and hence it is sorting to exosome [ 105 ] . ESCRT‑independent mechanism Accumulating evidence suggests an ESCRT - independent pathway in the biogenesis of exosomes ( Fig . 3 ) . Inhibition of neutral sphingomyelinase ( nSMase ) enzyme required for hydrolysis of sphingomyelin to ceramide with GW4869 resulted in the decreased release of PLP - bearing exosome from an oligodendroglial cell line . This suggested ceramide - mediated sorting of PLP into ILVs and hence ESCRT - inde - pendent formation of exosomes [ 70 ] . Similar observations , showing reduced secretion of exosomal proteins ( CD63 , CD81 , or TSG101 ) with GW4869 treatment , were also reported in other models , including tumor cell lines [ 99 , 106 ] and HEK293 cells [ 107 , 108 ] . Contrarily , treatment of primary cell lines with GW4869 , at the concentration which does not induce cell death , resulted in increased release of exosomes . At a higher concentration of GW4869 , exosome secretion was hampered due to drug - induced cell death . A CD63 - dependent mechanism has been implicated in the formation of ILVs and the release of exosomes , as CD63 is reported to be involved in targeting the Epstein Barr virus - encoded latent membrane protein 1 ( LMP1 ) protein to ILVs and its release in exosomes [ 109 ] . Further importance 83 Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry ( 2020 ) 467 : 77 – 94 1 3 of CD63 in the biogenesis of exosomes was elucidated in human melanoma cells where CD63 - dependent mechanism , not depletion of neutral sphingomyelinases , affects the for - mation of MVBs or release of exosomes [ 110 ] . Overexpression of CD9 or CD82 in HEK293 cells induced secretion of β - catenin by exosomes generated by a ceramide - dependent mechanism [ 107 ] . ESCRT - independent mechanism was found to be instrumental not only in the formation of MVBs and exosomes but also in the modification of exosome contents . In rat pancre - atic adenocarcinoma model ( As - Tspan8 ) , the expression of tetraspanin Tspan8 resulted in the modification of mRNA and transmembrane proteins ( VCAM - 1 , α4 integ - rin ) contents in exosomes [ 111 ] . Recently CD81 - enriched domains have been implicated in the selection of cargo molecules for packaging into exosomes , thus explaining an ESCRT - independent mechanism for sorting of cargoes and formation of ILVs . Primary lymphoblast cell culture from CD81 knockout mice showed impaired sorting of B - cell receptor MHC molecules and ICAM - 1 in exosomes and reduction in Rac proportion in exosomes suggesting the importance of CD81 in the loading of tetraspanins - interacting molecules into exosomes [ 112 ] . Zhu et al . showed secretion of SIMPLE , a small inte - gral membrane protein of lysosomes and late endosomes , in association with exosomes . Fibroblast cells expressing mutant SIMPLE protein resulted in reduced secretion of CD63 - and ALIX - containing exosomes in Charcot - Marie - Tooth disease patients . Though SIMPLE contains binding domains for Nedd4 type - 3 ubiquitin ligase and TSG101 , the exact regulatory mechanism of exosome secretion involving SIMPLE and its interaction with Nedd4 type - 3 ubiquitin ligase or TSG101 is yet to be elucidated [ 113 ] . Fig . 3 Mechanisms of exosome uptake by recipient cells . Sche - matic representation of different pathways involved with the uptake of exosomes by recipient cells . The adhesion of exosomes on recipi - ent cells utilizes various surface molecules on exosomes and cellular receptors . Upon binding to cells , exosomes are internalized by mem - brane fusion , phagocytosis , macropinocytosis , or endocytosed via clathrin - , caveolin - or lipid raft - mediated endocytosis 84 Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry ( 2020 ) 467 : 77 – 94 1 3 Secretion Depending on the type of cell origin , mechanisms of release of exosomes from cells are broadly classified as constitutive or inducible . The pathways for the constitutive secretion of exosomes are mediated by heterotrimeric G - protein , protein kinase D [ 114 ] , and Rab GTPases [ 51 , 115 ] . The induc - ible secretion of exosomes is mediated by various physi - cal , chemical , and biological stimuli such as low pH [ 116 ] , DNA damage [ 117 , 118 ] , thrombin , extracellular ATP [ 119 ] , increased intracellular Ca 2 + [ 120 , 121 ] , hypoxia , and LPS [ 122 ] stimulation . In an in vitro study , mild hypoxia trig - gered an increase in exosome release by cardiomyocytes , thus exemplifying inducible exosome secretion [ 123 ] . A study investigating growth factor - mediated stimulation of cardiomyocytes and variation in transcriptional contents of cardiomyocytes - derived exosomes have been observed in response to the platelet - derived growth factor ( PDGF - BB ) and transforming growth factor ( TGF ) - β2 treatment . The unique mRNA contents in exosomes derived from stimulated or non - stimulated cardiomyocytes with growth factors sug - gested the influence of environmental signals in the secretion of exosome with varied contents [ 124 ] . The rate of secretion and protein composition of exosomes from cardiomyocytes is affected by pathological changes such as pH change , fever , oxidative stress , and ethanol treatment [ 125 ] . Being a highly controlled orchestrated process , in some cells , exosome secretion is regulated by p53 protein [ 117 ] , the transmem - brane protein TSAP6 [ 53 , 126 ] , and also dependent of lipid mediators such as diacylglycerol . The secretion of exosomes from cell requires molecular machinery involved in the transport of MVBs to the cell periphery , docking , and fusion with the plasma membrane . The process of exosome secretion is regulated by cytoskel - eton molecules ( actin and microtubules ) , myosins and kine - sins , Rab family of GTPases , and fusion machinery , i . e . , soluble NSF attachment protein receptors ( SNAREs ) and tethering factors [ 127 ] . The Rab proteins have been impli - cated in the regulation of intracellular vesicular trafficking such as vesicle budding , docking , and membrane fusion using GTPase activity [ 128 ] . Further , using dominant - nega - tive Rab11 mutant in reticulocytes , the pivotal role of Rab11 in the regulation of secretion of TfR - and HSC70 - containing exosomes had been demonstrated [ 129 ] . Other molecular regulators such as Rab27a , Rab27b Rab4 , Rab5 , Rab35 , RalA , cortactin [ 130 ] , and synaptotagmin - 7 [ 99 ] have been implicated in different steps of exosomal release from dif - ferent cells [ 51 , 115 , 129 , 131 ] . RNAi - mediated depletion of Rab5A , Rab9A , Rab2B , Rab27A , and Rab27B , but not Rab11A or Rab7 resulted in a significant decrease in exosome secretion in HeLa - CIITA cells . Rab7 was required for the secretion of syn - tenin - and ALIX - containing exosome in MCF - 7 cells [ 51 ] . Association of Rab27 with secretory lysosome - related organelles suggested a functional association between endocytic compartments and exosome secretion . Silencing of Rab27 effectors , Slp4 ( synaptotagmin - like 4 ) , and Slac2b ( exophilin 5 ) resulted in a phenotype similar to Rab27a and Rab27b silencing and showed reduced exosome secre - tion [ 51 ] . Knockdown of Rab35 and its activating proteins TBC1D10A – C in oligodendroglial cells led to intracellular accumulation of vesicle and impaired PLP - bearing exo - some secretion [ 115 ] . In human cell line RPE1 , secretion of anthrax toxin - bearing exosome in extracellular medium required Rab11 or Rab35 activity [ 103 ] . The Rab proteins appeared to be essential for the docking of MVBs to the plasma membrane , which is subsequently required for fusion and secretion of vesicles . Regulation of exosome secretion has been observed in several cellular models in response to biological stimuli . An increase in the intracellular calcium concentration leads to an increase in exosome secretion in the human erythroleuke - mia cell line suggesting the role of calcium along with Rab in MVBs fusion [ 132 ] . Stimulation of platelets for the shed - ding of vesicles from the plasma membrane and activation by thrombin receptor agonist facilitate the release of EVs from the cells [ 133 ] . Similarly , ATP - mediated activation of the purinergic receptor , P2X7R , resulted in MV secretion [ 134 ] . While the interaction of peptide - loaded immature dendritic cells with T cells recognizing peptide - loaded MHC class II stimulates the release of exosomes [ 102 ] , T cells release exosomes in response to the stimulation by cross - linking of CD3 in T cells [ 135 ] . The fusion of MVBs with the plasma membrane is a pivotal step in the release of exosomes in the extracellular environment . Though exact molecular machinery involved in MVBs fusion with the plasma membrane is not clearly understood , proteins such as SNAREs , Rabs , Ras GTPases , and tethering factors have been reported in membrane fusion [ 136 ] . SNARE proteins are implicated in the fusion of vesi - cles with the plasma membrane or membrane of different organelles [ 137 ] . SNARE complex is comprised of three or four SNARE protein assembled in coiled - coil helices . The SNARE proteins are classified as R - or Q - SNAREs . The fusion generally involves one R - SNARE and three Q - SNAREs [ 136 ] . The interaction of SNARE complex containing TI - VAMP / VAMP7 , soluble NSF attachment protein 23 ( SNAP - 23 ) , and syntaxin 4 with Ca 2 + bind - ing synaptotagmin VII have been functionally implicated in Ca 2 + - regulated exocytosis of conventional lysosomes [ 138 ] . The ca 2 + - dependent fusion of secretory lysosomes with the plasma membrane in mastocytes [ 139 , 140 ] and neutrophils showed SNAP - 23 interaction with lysosomal VAMP8 and VAMP7 , respectively [ 141 ] . Published litera - ture demonstrated the involvement of longin domain of the vesicle - associated membrane protein 7 ( TI - VAMP / VAMP7 ) 85 Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry ( 2020 ) 467 : 77 – 94 1 3 in vesicular trafficking [ 142 – 144 ] . In the K562 cell line , I - VAMP / VAMP7 but not VAMP3 mediates fusion of MVBs with plasma membrane for acetylcholinesterase - containing EVs secretion [ 145 ] . Further , the SNARE complex forma - tion was inhibited by the overexpression of the N - terminal domain of TI - VAMP / VAMP7 , leading to the enlargement of MVBs at the cell periphery . This suggested the requirement of active TI - VAMP / VAMP7 for the fusion of MVBs with the plasma membrane [ 145 ] . The R - SNARE protein , Ykt6 , found to be prerequisite for exosome secretion as depletion of Ykt6 in human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells lead to a decrease in WNT3A - , TSG101 - , and VPS26 / 35 - containing exosomes [ 98 ] and knockdown of Ykt6 is associated with reduced TSG101 - containing exosomes in A549 human lung cancer cells [ 146 ] . Distinct SNARE proteins promote the fusion of MVBs with the plasma membrane for the secretion of the different subpopulations of exosomes from single cell types . Thus , Inhibition of specific SNARE protein might affect the secretion of an only particular subpopulation of exosomes . Modes of uptake of exosomes into the recipient cells Once released in the extracellular environment , the ability of exosomes to interact with recipient cells and transfer of proteins , lipids , and nucleic acid contents determines its role in physiological and pathological processes . Though several mechanisms have been hypothesized [ 147 – 149 ] , the exact mechanism of exosome uptake by recipient cells is yet to be elucidated . Some of the widely discussed mechanisms for exosome uptake are phagocytosis , macropinocytosis , Clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) , Caveolin - dependent endocytosis ( CDE ) , and plasma membrane fusion ( Fig . 3 ) . Phagocytosis Phagocytosis is an actin - mediated process responsible for the internalization of opsonized matter such as bacteria , EVs , and others . It involves specific receptors such as Toll - like receptors , scavenger , and complement receptors , which facilitate the formation of invaginations around the mate - rial intended for internalization [ 150 , 151 ] . Initially thought as process to eliminate larger particles by internalization , phagocytosis showed immune clearance of particles as small as 85 nm suggesting the role of phagocytosis in the uptake of exosomes by recipient cells [ 152 ] . Specialized cells per - forming phagocytosis are broadly classified as professional phagocytes , i . e . , macrophages , dendritic cells , and non - pro - fessional phagocytes , i . e . , γδ T cells [ 150 , 153 ] . Phagocytosis may represent the process for EVs clear - ance by the immune system rather than internalization and elicitation of cellular response , as evidenced by the pres - ence of Phosphatidylserine ( PS ) on the outer surface of EVs which facilitate its uptake . PS appears to be an essential component of EVs for triggering its clearance by phago - cytosis and implicated in viral entry into cells via macro - pinocytosis [ 154 ] . Antibodies against TIM4 , a receptor involved in PS - mediated phagocytosis [ 149 , 155 ] , impair uptake of EVs by macrophages [ 149 ] . Treatment of EVs with PS - binding protein Annexin V leads to a decrease in the uptake of EVs by macrophages and NK cells . Reduced EVs uptake by bone marrow dendritic cells upon treatment with O - phospho - l - serine , a soluble analog of PS , highlighted PS - triggered phagocytosis of EVs [ 156 ] . The process phagocy - tosis is proposed as a mechanism of exosome internalization as observed by more efficient internalization of the leukemic cell ( K562 and MT4 ) - derived exosomes by monocytic or macrophagic cell lines than non - professional phagocytic cells such as human embryonic kidney cells and Jurkat T cells [ 149 ] . Phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) , actin cytoskel - eton , and dynamin 2 have been implicated in phagocytosis [ 157 ] and clathrin - mediated endocytosis [ 71 ] highlighting ( PI3K ) - , actin cytoskeleton - , and dynamin - 2 - dependent exo - some uptake by recipient cells . PI3Ks are crucial for phago - cytosis as it functions by facilitating membrane insertion into the formation of phagosomes [ 158 ] . Further , treatment of mouse RAW 264 . 7 macrophages with PI3K inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 resulted in dose - dependent inhi - bition of internalization of exosomes by macrophages sug - gesting the importance of PI3Ks in phagocytosis and thus phagocytosis - dependent uptake of exosomes into cells [ 149 ] . The internalized exosome can co - localize in endosomal and lysosomal vesicles and / or late autophagosomes [ 159 ] with Lamp - 1 , lysobisphosphatidic acid , and Rab7 [ 149 ] . Future research will be required to elucidate the exact role of phago - cytosis , i . e . , mechanism of immune clearance or process of exosome internalization for intercellular communication . Macropinocytosis Macropinocytosis represents one of the endocytic pathways for internalization of extracellular molecules . It is charac - terized by plasma membrane ruffling induced by growth factor or other cellular signal stimulation . The resulting vesicles contain extracellular fluid , and small particles are present around the membrane ruffling region [ 150 ] . Similar to phagocytosis , macropinocytosis is induced by signal - ing cascade involving Rho family GTPases , which facili - tate actin - driven membrane protrusions formation . Unlike phagocytosis , during macropinocytosis , the membrane pro - trusions driven by actin filaments encompass extracellular fluid and molecules ; subsequently , membrane protrusions 86 Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry ( 2020 ) 467 : 77 – 94 1 3 fuse with the plasma membrane to generate endocytic vesi - cle and macropinosomes [ 151 ] . Though characterized by unregulated membrane ruffling , macropinocytosis is likely to be a tightly controlled pro - cess of endocytosis . The mechanism of macropinocytosis of exosome is dependent on Na + / H + exchanger function , actin , rac1 GTPase activity , cholesterol , dynamin , and low pH [ 160 ] . Cholesterol plays a crucial role in macropino - cytosis as it facilitates membrane localization of GTPase Rac1 , actin reorganization , and hence membrane ruffling [ 161 ] . Activated Rac1 has been implicated in the internali - zation of extracellular proteins by the endocytic pathway of macropinocytosis [ 162 ] . Though the exact mechanism of function is not yet known , Phosphatidylinositol - 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) , ras , and src activities have been implicated in pro - moting macropinocytosis probably by downstream recep - tor ligation [ 163 – 165 ] . Treatment of PC12 cells with Na + / H + exchanger inhibitor ethyl - isopropyl amiloride ( EIPA ) and phosphoinositide 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) inhibitor LY294002 showed a dose - dependent reduction of exosome uptake by PC12 cells . This highlighted Na + / H + exchanger - and PI3K - dependent macropinocytosis for exosome uptake [ 166 ] . The role of macropinocytosis - mediated exosome uptake by microglia was explained by using specific pharmacological inhibitors against actin , rac1 GTPase activity , and dynamin . Inhibition of Rac1 by NSC23766 ; dynamin by dynasore ; Na + / H + exchanger activity by amiloride ; and actin cytoskel - eton by cytochalasin D showed reduced oligodendrocyte - derived exosome internalization by microglia [ 167 ] . Surface phosphatidylserine from primary oligodendrocyte - derived exosomes triggered the process of macropinocytosis in microglia [ 167 ] . Vacuolar acidification has been identi - fied as being crucial in macropinocytosis [ 168 ] . Treatment of microglia cells with alkalinizing drugs bafilomycin A , monensin , and chloroquine resulted in reduced uptake of exosomes suggesting the role of low pH in promoting macro - pinocytosis . Contrarily , other studies did not find involve - ment of macropinocytosis as a mechanism of exosome inter - nalization [ 149 , 169 , 170 ] . Hence further investigations are warranted to unravel mechanistic insight of macropinocyto - sis and its involvement in exosome uptake . Clathrin‑mediated endocytosis ( CME ) CME is a receptor - mediated endocytic process that involves interaction between ligand on the exosomal surface and spe - cific receptors present on the plasma membrane for inter - nalization . It utilizes clathrin and adaptor protein 2 ( AP2 ) complexes for the subsequent formation of clathrin - coated vesicles for the internalization of molecules . The clathrin - coated vesicles alter the structure of the plasma membrane and result in the invagination of the membrane . Subse - quently , the intracellular vesicles undergo the un - coating of clathrin to fuse with endosome and transfer of cargo mol - ecules [ 171 ] . The inhibition of clathrin coating and associ - ated components by different inhibitory molecules and its effect on EVs uptake suggested the role of CME in exo - some internalization . The clathrin - coated pit formation at the plasma membrane was found to be inhibited by chlor - promazine and thus affecting exosome internalization by recipient cells [ 172 ] . Treatment of SKOV3 ovarian cancer cell line with chlorpromazine resulted in decreased uptake of EVs [ 173 ] . Similarly , macrophages pre - treated with chlor - promazine showed dose - dependent and clathrin - dependent endocytosis inhibition of EVs uptake [ 149 ] . Dynamin 2 , clathrin , and AP2 complex are well - charac - terized coat proteins involved in clathrin - associated endo - cytosis . AP - 2 adaptor complex plays an essential organi - zational role in plasma membrane - coated pits by driving clathrin assembly onto the cytosolic leaflet of the plasma membrane and interact with di - leucine and tyrosine - based endocytic signals for cargo selection [ 174 – 176 ] . The AP - 2 adaptor complex - associated Epidermal growth factor receptor pathway substrate clone 15 ( EPS15 ) is a compo - nent of clathrin - coated pits [ 177 ] . The expression of the Ep15 mutant lacking the EH domain resulted in impaired CME and reduced EVs uptake by cells [ 149 ] . Dynamin 2 is GTPase essential for the CME process and associated with vesicle scission from the plasma membrane . Dynamin 2 is recruited to clathrin - coated pits and assembled as a collar - like structure at the neck on budding vesicles [ 178 – 180 ] . The blockage of EVs internalization activity was observed in phagocytic cells upon inhibition of dynamin 2 [ 149 , 167 , 181 ] . Caveolin‑dependent endocytosis ( CDE ) CDE is a raft - mediated endocytosis , which requires the presence of caveolin , a dimeric protein with cholesterol - rich microdomains , in the plasma membrane . Caveolae are small flask - shaped invaginations in the plasma membrane implicated in extensive transcellular shuttling . Caveolae represent caveolin , cholesterol , and sphingolipid - rich sub - domains of glycolipid rafts of the plasma membrane . The unique morphology of caveolae is conferred by caveolin , which embeds in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane as a hairpin loop with both its N and C termini exposed to the cytoplasm and form a spike - like caveolin coat on the caveolae . Caveolin - 1 ( Cav1 ) interacts with cholesterol for the formation of membrane invagination . Hence treat - ment with cholesterol depletion agents such as methyl - b - cyclodextrin ( MbCD ) and filipin flattens the caveolae making CDE sensitive to cholesterol depletion [ 182 – 184 ] . The formation of caveolae has been disrupted using over - expression of dominant - negative caveolin mutant and knockout of the CAV1 gene [ 185 , 186 ] . While Knockdown 87 Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry ( 2020 ) 467 : 77 – 94 1 3 of Cav1 significantly suppressed internalization of exo - some by epithelial cells , increased endocytic uptake of exosomes was observed in Cav1 knockout mouse fibroblast cells [ 187 ] . Like CME , Dynamin 2 has been implicated in CDE for assembly and expansion of caveolae in the plasma membrane for endocytic internalization [ 150 , 183 , 188 ] . Inhibition of dynamin 2 activity by dynasore leads to a significant reduction of EVs uptake by CNE1 and macrophages , suggesting the role of CDE in EVs inter - nalization [ 170 , 189 ] . As dynamin 2 is also an integral part of CME and not exclusively required in CDE , the role of CME for EVs uptake in these experiments cannot be overlooked [ 190 ] . The available literature implies the role of caveolin - dependent endocytosis for the uptake of EVs , although the precise mechanism of internalization may differ depending on the type of EVs and recipient cells . Plasma membrane fusion Fusion is another mechanism of EVs internalization by which EVs membrane directly merges with the cell plasma membrane and transfer cargo molecules to recipient cells [ 116 ] . During cell surface membrane fusion , two distinct lipid bilayer membranes come into proximity and lead to the formation of hemifusion stalk due to the fusion of outer leaflets . Resulting from the expansion of stalk , hemifusion diaphragm bilayer appears , and eventually , fusion pore opens , facilitating the mixing of two hydrophobic cores [ 191 – 193 ] . Proteins such as Rab proteins , Sec1 / Munc - 18 related proteins ( SM proteins ) , Lamp - 1 , and SNAREs con - tribute in the process of fusion [ 194 ] . Monocyte - derived ( CD45 + ) microvesicles bind to activated platelets through an interaction of P - selectin glycoprotein ligand - 1 ( PSGL - 1 ) on microvesicles and P - selectin on the platelets . The binding subsequently leads to fusion and transfer of pro - teins such as ( PSGL - 1 ) and tissue factor to recipient cells [ 195 ] . Using the fluorescent lipid dequenching technique , the study demonstrated the fusion of melanoma - derived exosomes with the plasma membrane and the phenom - enon was found to be enhanced by acidic conditions . The fusion activity was found to be inhibited by filipin as it affects membrane composition through its association with cholesterol [ 195 ] . The fusion of R18 - labeled EVs with the plasma membrane of bone marrow - derived dendritic cells and the transfer of miRNAs and luciferin to target cells further corroborated cell membrane fusion as one of the possible mechanisms of EVs internalization by recipient cell [ 196 ] . Though the study reported acidic pH condi - tions as a prerequisite for fusion - mediated internalization and cargo transfer , further investigations are required to explain the phenomenon in physiological conditions . Conclusion The field of EVs is expanding very rapidly . Particularly , the past few years have witnessed an exponential increase in studies investigating the biological characteristics of exosomes . This review summarizes the underlying mechanisms involved in exosome biogenesis . The role of exosomes in intercellular communication and its promise as a potential therapeutic agent has stimulated scientific interest in EV research in the recent decade . Numer - ously published literature has advanced our understand - ing of mechanisms involved in the biogenesis , secretion , and uptake of exosomes . Discrepancies in the described mechanisms of exosome biogenesis represent either the intrinsic properties of secreting cell , nature of secreted vesicle , or physiological stimuli . Thus , the discovery of a universal mechanism explaining these phenomena appears to be crucial and highly warranted . The capacity of exosomes to envelope a wide range of content , including lipids , proteins , and genetic material that signals specific recipient cells or tissues , makes them a promising therapeutic tool . However , one of the significant limitations hindering the advancement of the exosome field is the absence of precise methods for isolation , purification , and characterization of exosomes . Until technical advance - ment answers questions pertaining to the composition of exosome cargo and physiological relevance of secreted exosomes , its role in physiological and pathological pro - cesses and development of exosome - based novel therapeutic interventions will remain a distant dream . To develop pre - cise techniques to study exosomes , it is imperative that we understand the mechanisms involved in exosome biogenesis , release , and uptake ; such studies may identify exosome - spe - cific markers that are crucial , and currently lacking , for the development of exosome research field .
