Methods The study population consisted of all the children and employees who attended the ECCC as well as household contacts of the confirmed COVID - 19 cases . Of the 120 individuals in the study , five cases were confirmed by epidemiological link and 25 were identified as COVID - 19 by RT - PCR among which 19 were analyzed by viral whole genome sequencing . Descriptive epidemiology , social network visualization , and phylogenetic analysis were used to characterize viral transmission . Results Phylogenetic analysis identified two separate introductions of distinct lineages of SARS - CoV - 2 and estimated an average effective reproductive number of R e = 1 . 9 ( range 0 . 9 – 4 . 9 ) with a mean doubling time of 3 . 2 days ( range 2 . 1 – 5 . 2 ) . The first and most prevalent lineage was introduced by two asymptomatic children who were likely infected by their parent , a confirmed COVID - 19 case working in a long - term care centre . Among infected household adults , attack rates were significantly higher in mothers than in fathers ( risk ratio = 4 . 5 ; 95 % CI 1 . 1 – 18 . 7 ) . The extent of transmission makes it one of the largest documented outbreaks in a daycare in Canada . Conclusion The analyses carried out showed the probable origin and direction of the transmission of the infection ( adult - child , child - adult , and child - child ) , thus highlighting how asymptomatic children can efficiently transmit SARS - CoV - 2 .

Sur les 120 personnes à l ’ étude , cinq cas ont été confirmés par lien épidémiologique et 25 par RT - PCR . Parmi ces derniers , 19 ont été analysés par séquençage viral du génome entier . La caractérisation de la transmission a été réalisée à l ’ aide d ’ analyses descriptives et phylogénétiques ainsi que de la visualisation de réseaux sociaux . Résultats L ’ analyse phylogénétique a identifié deux introductions de lignées distinctes du SRAS - CoV - 2 et un taux de repro - duction net R e = 1 , 9 ( étendue 0 , 9 – 4 , 9 ) avec un temps moyen de doublement de 3 , 2 jours ( étendue 2 , 1 – 5 , 2 ) . La première lignée , et la plus répandue , a été introduite par deux enfants asymptomatiques qui ont probablement été infectés par leur parent , un travailleur de la santé atteint de COVID - 19 . Dans les noyaux familiaux , les taux d ’ attaque étaient significativement plus élevés chez les mères que chez les pères ( rapport de risque = 4 , 5 ; IC à 95 % 1 , 1 – 18 , 7 ) . L ’ ampleur de la transmission en fait de celle - ci la plus importante éclosion documentée dans un service de garde au Canada . Conclusion Cette étude a permis de déterminer l ’ origine et la direction probables de la transmission de l ’ infection ( adulte - enfant , enfant - adulte et enfant - enfant ) et démontrer que les enfants asymptomatiques peuvent transmettre le SRAS - CoV - 2 .

The World Health Organization declared the corona - virus disease ( COVID - 19 ) a public health emergency of inter - national concern on January 30 , 2020 and a global pandemic on March 11 ( Organisation mondiale de la Santé , 2020 ) . Multiple studies have aimed to characterize infection and transmission in children , with mixed results . Children under the age of 10 appear to be less clinically affected by COVID - 19 , even in the presence of high viral load and changes in pulmonary or serum biochemistry ( Hu et al . , 2020 ) . At the beginning of the pandemic , cases of COVID - 19 in children tended to have a history of exposure to a case in the family or in other adults ( Ludvigsson , 2020 ; Zhu et al . , 2020 ) . However , they were rarely identified as index cases in domestic or other outbreaks , suggesting the limited potential for children to seed onward transmission ( Kiely et al . , 2020 ) . Other studies have implicated children as source cases ( Merckx et al . , 2020 ) , thus the role of children in the transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 re - mains unclear . Starting March 15 , 2020 , the province of Quebec , Canada , was under lockdown and schools and daycares were closed . Emergency childcare centres ( ECCC ) were made available for children whose parents are essential workers . The present study was carried out following the report of an outbreak of COVID - 19 in an ECCC located in an administrative region of around 500 , 000 inhabitants . From its opening to the beginning of the outbreak , the service had been frequented by 50 children in total ( with a mean of 20 children present each day , separated into two or three groups ) and between 12 and 28 full - and part - time employees . As the number of children could differ each day , educators could be assigned to a different group of children each day . At the time of the out - break investigation , which was still early in the first wave , public health recommendations for childcare workers in terms of protective measures such as the use of masks and face shields were not yet in use . Also , physical distancing was difficult to respect . Because this event constituted an oppor - tune “ hot spot ” setting , public health authorities agreed to further investigate the outbreak to better understand the trans - mission dynamics of SARS - CoV - 2 within the ECCC , to iden - tify the probable source of introduction of the virus and the factors which favoured the development of the outbreak . Methods In our investigation , three approaches were used to character - ize the outbreak : descriptive epidemiology , social network analysis ( SNA ) , and phylogenetic analysis of viral genome sequences . Participants The study population included all children and employees who attended the ECCC for at least one day from April 9 until its closure on May 5 and family contacts of confirmed cases ( extended to May 18 to ensure follow - up ) . A unique identifier was attributed to cases and contacts starting with a C for “ child ” and A for “ adult ” followed by E if they were associ - ated with the ECCC , or H if they were from a household . For the purposes of the investigation , case definitions for con - firmed and suspected cases were established for contacts as well ( Fig . 1 ) . Household contacts were monitored daily for symptoms and only symptomatic contacts were tested . 567 Can J Public Health ( 2021 ) 112 : 566 – 575 Procedures Diagnosis of COVID - 19 was performed by RT - PCR ; positive samples were referred to the Public Health Laboratory of Quebec ( LSPQ ) for confirmation . The epidemiological data were collected by the staff of the Regional Public Health Department ( RPHD ) . Additional data collection was carried out by consulting the ECCC attendance records and by tele - phone interviews with adults and children who attended the ECCC . For SNA , household and ECCC components were characterized , and networks were visualized with the Pajek software v . 5 . 08 ( http : / / mrvar . fdv . uni - lj . si / pajek ) . For phylogenetic analyses , nucleic acids were extracted from nasopharyngeal specimens of cases , and reverse transcription was performed at the LSPQ . Full details of phylogenetic analyses and on parameter priors and MCMC ( Markov chain Monte Carlo ) implementation are in the Supplementary Materials ( Table S1 ) . Statistical analysis For continuous variables , mean values of confirmed cases and contacts were compared with a Student ’ s t - test . Exploratory analyses of association between certain variables of interest were performed using the chi - square test of independence , or the exact mid - p test when a chi - square statistic - predicted value was < 5 . Ninety - five percent confidence intervals were calcu - lated to estimate the precision of the association measures studied . All statistical calculations were performed using SPSS - PC version 25 , or Open Source Epidemiological Statistics for Public Health ( OpenEpi version 3 . 01 ) . Missing data were excluded from analyses . Ethical issues This investigation was carried out in accordance with the legal mandate granted to public health authorities by Quebec ’ s Public Health Act ( LRQ , chapter S - 2 . 2 . Article 1 ) ( Publications Québec , 2020 ) as part of a public health inter - vention . Interview participants ( or legal guardians in the case of children ) gave verbal consent at the time of the investiga - tor ’ s phone call , which was documented . All data were treated confidentially and analyzed without nominal identification in accordance with the Policy on Information Protection and Security ( PO - 04 - 2014 ) of the Institut national de santé publique du Québec . Results A total of 120 individuals participated in the investigation , 81 ( 68 . 1 % ) of whom frequented or worked at the ECCC . Ninety - three people were tested by RT - PCR , and according to the case definitions , 25 were laboratory - confirmed COVID - 19 cases , five were epidemiologically linked , and three were con - sidered suspected cases . As expected for an ECCC - focused study , the ratio of children to adults among the 30 confirmed cases was 1 . 5 . Table 1 also shows that the majority were Fig . 1 Case definition algorithm . COVID - 19 outbreak investigation , 9 April to 18 May 2020 ( Institut national de santé publique du Québec , 2020 ; Kucirka et al . , 2020 ; Ministère de la Santé et des Services sociaux , 2020 ) 568 Can J Public Health ( 2021 ) 112 : 566 – 575 children ( 81 . 0 % ) and significantly more cases were present in the ECCC ( 70 . 0 % ) than in households ( 30 . 0 % ) . No significant differences were observed when cases and contacts were compared according to their sex , age , and having frequented or not the ECCC ( data not shown ) . Overall , the attack rate for the outbreak was 25 . 0 % ( 30 / 120 ) . Among the 35 adults from households , 14 ( 40 . 0 % ) worked in a healthcare setting , i . e . , hospitals , long - term care centres ( LTCC ) , or nursing homes . In households , there were also more cases among mothers ( 6 / 12 or 50 . 0 % ) than among fathers ( 2 / 16 or 11 . 1 % ) ( p = 0 . 04 , risk ratio = 4 . 5 , 95 % CI = 1 . 1 – 18 . 7 ) . Among the 30 confirmed cases , 22 ( 73 . 3 % ) reported symptoms ( 11 adults and 11 children ) either at initial investigation or at follow - up , and one adult and seven children were asymptomatic . The proportion of asymptomatic cases was approximately four times higher in children ( 38 . 9 % ) than in adults ( 9 . 1 % ) , although the difference was not significant ( p = 0 . 102 ) . None of the cases required hospi - talization and all were stable or recovered at follow - up , which was up to 24 days after closing ( May 28 ) . Figure 2 illustrates the distribution of cases according to the date of symptoms onset , or the date of laboratory sampling for the eight asymptomatic cases . Figure S1 illustrates the esti - mated contagious periods of each case . The index case was declared on April 28 , 4 days after the onset of symptoms . Two adult cases were identified with a date of symptoms onset before the index case . The first was a healthcare worker work - ing in a LTCC where an outbreak of COVID - 19 was under - way . This person started their symptoms on April 16 and had two children who attended the ECCC on April 16 and 17 . Although the children both tested negative for SARS - CoV - 2 , they were classified as suspected cases because the test was performed 3 weeks after their parent ’ s onset of symptoms .

COVID - 19 outbreak investigation , 9 April to 18 May 2020 569 Can J Public Health ( 2021 ) 112 : 566 – 575 second adult case , an educator at the ECCC , started their symptoms while at work on April 22 . The educator was absent on April 23 and 24 and returned to work on April 27 . The number of cases increased from April 24 with a peak of 11 new cases on May 3 , which corresponds to the referral for the diagnostic tests for anyone present at the ECCC on April 23 and 24 . Cases were first detected in the ECCC attendees and then in their households . To better characterize the transmission of the infection within the ECCC , exposure to days where suspected and in - fected cases were present at the centre was assessed . First , exposure to the ECCC on April 16 and 17 was assessed for the 81 individuals who attended the centre and were tested . The two suspected children ( CE029 and CE030 ) attended the centre on those two dates before beginning isolation at home . A significantly higher proportion of cases attended the ECCC on those dates than ECCC contacts , 71 . 4 % and 26 . 7 % , respec - tively ( p = 0 . 0002 ) . Second , exposure to the ECCC during the contagious period of the index case ( April 23 and 24 ) was assessed . A significantly higher proportion of cases attended the ECCC on these days than ECCC contacts , 90 . 5 % and 33 . 3 % , respectively ( p ˂ 0 . 0001 ) . Finally , on average , cases ( both children and adults ) attended the ECCC more days than contacts . Child cases attended the ECCC for a mean of 11 . 2 days while contacts attended the ECCC for a mean of 5 . 2 days . Adult cases attended the ECCC for a mean of 12 . 8 days while contacts attended the ECCC for a mean of 3 . 9 days ( respectively p ˂ 0 . 0001 and p ˂ 0 . 001 ) . Among the 25 individuals who tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 , specimens from 21 cases were sent to the LSPQ , of which 19 were sequenced ( two specimens were of too low quality ) . Figure 3 illustrates the phylogenetic trees ( of genetic distance and based on sampling dates ) of these 19 viruses , and shows the alignment of specific point mutations that distin - guish the genomes . All sequenced genomes belong to clade 20B according to the Nextstrain ( Hadfield et al . , 2018 ) no - menclature and clade B . 1 . 1 in the Pangolin nomenclature ( Cov - lineages / pangolin . [ Python ] . https : / / github . com / cov - lineages / pangolin ( original work published 2020 ) ) ( Rambaut et al . , 2020 ) . Two sub - lineages were evident based on phylo - genetic clustering . The first ( cluster A ) was composed of 10 individuals , including the healthcare worker with the earliest symptoms onset date ( AH028 ) , and the second ( cluster B ) of only two individuals which differed from cluster A by four single nucleotide variants . Cluster A contained additional var - iants , whereas both cluster B sequences were identical . SARS - CoV - 2 evolves at a rate of ~ 1 . 1 × 10 − 3 mutations / site / year ( Duchene et al . , 2020 ; Rambaut et al . , 2020 ) , which corre - sponds to roughly one mutation every 11 days . Since the out - break took place over a period of about a single month , we would therefore expect to observe approximately 2 . 7 muta - tions by chance in related cases . The genetic diversity within cluster A is thus consistent with evolution occurring during the ECCC outbreak , whereas the 4 mutations that separate clusters A and B suggest a common ancestor before the be - ginning of the ECCC outbreak ( Fig . 3A ) . There were therefore most likely two separate introductions at the ECCC . The clo - sure of the daycare likely stopped the second introduction from spreading further . Two siblings ( CE020 and CE021 ) sampled at the same time were found to have viral genomes that differed by one mutation ( black squares in Fig . 3 ) . This complicates the pos - sibility of sibling - to - sibling transmission because , while a de novo mutation in one sibling ( before sampling ) is possible , Fig . 3 Phylogenetic trees of SARS - CoV - 2 genomes from the ECCC outbreak . A Neighbour - joining tree showing genetic distance between genomes . B Time - scaled maximum clade credibility tree , built using sampling dates . Branches are coloured based on phylogenetic cluster designation . Black squares annotate the two siblings who were sampled at the same time , but with different viral genome sequences 570 Can J Public Health ( 2021 ) 112 : 566 – 575 three other cases also shared this mutation ( cluster A1 or A1 + ) at the same sampling time . Without clear epidemiological links ( and more sequences prior to May 3 ) , other explanations such as infection of the siblings by different individuals or by a single individual with a mixed infection cannot be ruled out . Finally , phylodynamic analyses of the viral genomes allowed for the estimation of key epidemiological parameters of the outbreak . The mean time to the most recent common ancestor ( tMRCA ) of the entire outbreak was estimated to be March 19 ( 95 % HPD : Feb . 15 – April 10 ) , which further sug - gests two introduction events because cluster A and B di - verged before the outbreak occurred . The mean effective re - production number for the outbreak was estimated to be 1 . 9 ( 95 % HPD : 0 . 9 – 4 . 9 ) and its variation over time is shown in the supplementary material in Fig . 6 . The generation interval ( i . e . , the doubling time ) was found to be 3 . 2 days ( 95 % HPD : 2 . 1 – 5 . 2 days ) if using the symptoms dates or only cluster A and its nested variants ( i . e . , a single transmission chain ) . When using sampling dates and all viral genomes ( including both transmission chains of clusters A and B ) , the doubling time was 5 . 9 days ( 95 % HPD : 4 . 2 – 10 days ; Fig . 7 in supple - mentary material ) . These values are similar to those found by previous SARS - CoV - 2 studies ( Ganyani et al . , 2020 ) . The social network in Fig . 4 illustrates the 30 cases of COVID - 19 represented by nodes ( circles ) and the edges ( lines ) between them depict family ties . A total of 18 families were associated with the ECCC outbreak and transmission within the household occurred in six of the families ( average of 1 . 7 cases generated by each family ) . The first case shown in the network ( AH028 with variant profile A ) was the parent of the two children considered as suspected cases ( CE029 and CE030 ) because they both attended the ECCC during her contagious period . The second adult case ( AE002 ) , who de - veloped symptoms prior to the index case ( CE001 ) , was also carrying the A variant . The other suspected case ( CE042 ) shown in the network was a child who attended the ECCC with 12 confirmed cases , but only got tested 12 days after he first started at the daycare . One of his parents was also a confirmed case but was asymptomatic . Discussion To date , this outbreak is the largest observed in Quebec in a childcare centre , with an attack rate of 25 . 0 % . Face masks combined with other preventive measures , such as frequent hand washing and physical distancing , were not applied reg - ularly or even possible . With what is currently known about the transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 , this likely contributed to the large number of cases . The number of cases ( n = 30 ) is similar to another outbreak seen in June 2020 at a childcare centre in Oregon , USA , with 28 cases ( Oregon Health Authority , 2020 ) . The symptoms observed both in children and adults in the ECCC outbreak are similar to those observed in other studies ( Meena et al . , 2020 ) .

Node ( circle ) colour : Blue is for adults , red is for children , and yellow is for cases who were classified as suspected because they were not tested or tested too late after exposure . Green illustrates the work - place . Edge ( line ) colours : Black depicts family ties between cases and red is for the workplace ties 571 Can J Public Health ( 2021 ) 112 : 566 – 575 In the ECCC , the four infected workers attended the centre for longer periods than their uninfected counterparts , suggesting that a longer exposure time could lead to a higher risk of trans - mission . The observed attack rate for staff was similar or higher ( 14 . 3 % ) to those seen in other studies where no secondary cases were attributed to contagious children attending school ( Heavey et al . , 2020 ; Stein - Zamir et al . , 2020 ) . Meanwhile , seroprevalence surveys of schools have been largely inconclu - sive . A study carried out in a primary school found no second - ary cases following the attendance of three contagious cases before the school was closed ( Fontanet et al . , 2020a ) . However , two other studies have shown a much higher propor - tion of seropositivity among staff . The first , in a high school , showed a seropositivity prevalence of 43 . 4 % among educators and 59 . 3 % among non - educators ( Fontanet et al . , 2020b ) . The second , with students ranging from preschool to high school , showed that 20 . 6 % of educators and 7 . 1 % of non - educators were seropositive ( Torres et al . , 2020 ) . In the outbreak described here , the number of people in - fected among household cases remained limited due to , among other things , the size of families . Notably , mothers appeared to be more affected than fathers . This suggests that mothers , if they tend to be primary childcare providers , are at higher risk of being infected . Children are rarely reported as index cases of household clusters . It is therefore difficult to compare the secondary at - tack rate in families seen in the present outbreak with those seen elsewhere . Some publications report secondary attack rates between 4 . 0 % and 10 . 2 % in children , and between 11 . 2 % and 17 . 1 % in adults ( Bi et al . , 2020 ; Fontanet et al . , 2020a ) . However , it is very difficult to identify the direction of transmissions involving children as they are often asymptom - atic and thus the point at which the child has acquired the infection is unknown . SNA allowed us to better understand the connections be - tween the cases and contacts , as well as the importance of certain individuals in the network . Regarding the source of the outbreak , phylogenetic analyses support two independent introduction events of SARS - CoV - 2 ( cluster A and cluster B ) into the ECCC . The earliest identified case , carrying a virus from cluster A , is the parent of the two children suspected of having introduced the infection into the ECCC on April 16 and 17 . This person is a healthcare worker at a LTCC that was experiencing an outbreak at the time , and was likely conta - gious as of April 14 . The first case carrying the cluster B variant is also the parent of a child attending the ECCC . This person worked in a private nursing home where several COVID - 19 cases had been identified . Based on the date of symptom onset ( May 5 ) and phylogenetic analyses , one of their children attending the ECCC likely acquired the infec - tion from them ( cluster B ) . The ECCC closed on the same day , explaining why we did not observe any further infections with the cluster B variant . With respect to the direction and dynamics of the infection , the three methodological approaches used in the study were complementary and made it possible to better characterize the outbreak . Genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis showed that , as expected , most individuals from the same family share the same genetic variants . The exception was a pair of siblings with different genetic variants , suggesting other trans - mission scenarios besides sibling - to - sibling transmission . The determination of the genetic variants in relation to the dates of symptom onset made it possible , in some cases , to make hypoth - eses about the direction of transmission . Three directions of trans - mission are apparent in our outbreak analysis : adult - to - child , child - to - adult , and child - to - child . Notably , no adult - to - adult transmissions were inferred . One adult - to - child transmission event resulted in the introduction of one of the viral variants into the ECCC , i . e . , the transmission from parent to child for which phylogenetic analyses were conclusive ( cluster B ) , with the in - fection being limited to these two cases . Three events of child - to - adult transmission were documented and corroborated by phylo - genetic analysis . Three children were infected at the ECCC ( all from cluster A and related variants ) , and then transmitted the infection to their parents . Of these , two children were symptom - atic , and one was asymptomatic . Although the sample size is relatively small , the results show that SARS - CoV - 2 transmission events involving children are possible . Finally , phylogenetic analysis showed that transmission between children occurred at least once . The child with the A1 + variant likely acquired the infection from one of the two other children with the A1 variant . However , there could be non - sampled intermediaries . Previous studies suggest children ’ s contribution to the spread of SARS - CoV - 2 is limited as compared with adults ( Rajmil , 2020 ) . However , most of these studies were performed in a lockdown context where contact was limited , thus masking any effects that children might have on transmission . Investigations in schools have tended to show low transmission rates ( Heavey et al . , 2020 ; Yung et al . , 2020 ) . However , avail - able studies ( Bi et al . , 2020 ; Li et al . , 2020 ; Posfay - Barbe et al . , 2020 ) suggest that children are just as susceptible to SARS - CoV - 2 infection as adults and that , even in the absence of symptoms , they can transmit it ( Li et al . , 2021 ; Ludvigsson , 2020 ; Posfay - Barbe et al . , 2020 ; Zhu et al . , 2020 ) . A more recent study from Wuhan showed that children who were sec - ondary cases were more likely to infect household members who were in contact with them during their infectious period ( Li et al . , 2021 ) . Furthermore , according to results from the Netherlands National Institute for Public Health and the Environment , the virus is largely transmitted between individ - uals of the same age ( National Institute for Public Health and the Environment , 2020 ) . More recently in India , a study revealed a high infection prevalence in contacts of children of the same age , speculating that transmission of the infection may happen during peer - to - peer interactions ( Laxminarayan et al . , 2020 ) . Similar conclusions may be surmised from the present study . 572 Can J Public Health ( 2021 ) 112 : 566 – 575 As in any observational study , several limitations should be highlighted . The investigation started while the outbreak was still active and the study population only included confirmed cases and their contacts . Although a follow - up was done among the children and educators who tested negative for SARS - CoV - 2 , not all household contacts were investigated . Also , at the time of the investigation , the public health direc - tive was to request diagnostic tests only for symptomatic household contacts , thereby potentially underestimating the number of confirmed cases linked to the ECCC . Despite the small sample size , we still observed significant differences in exposures between cases and contacts . Another limitation was the delay in testing for some people . Three suspected cases were tested up to a month after the date of onset of their relatives ’ symptoms ( Sethuraman et al . , 2020 ) . In addition , a few individuals refused to get tested . Serological tests would have allowed quantifying the underestimation , but they were not available in Quebec at the time of study . Finally , phylo - genetic analyses are limited in resolution due to the relative lack of genetic diversity in SARS - CoV - 2 over weekly time scales . Moreover , we were unable to sequence all cases . It is therefore possible that intermediate links in the chain of trans - mission were missed . Taking these into consideration , the present study cannot be generalized to other outbreaks and the general population . Conclusion Our case study demonstrates how SARS - CoV - 2 can be trans - mitted from healthcare workers to their children , and then from children to other adults or children in their daycare or household . Spread by asymptomatic children highlights the importance of rapid action after the detection of an index case , and of implementing other preventive measures . Our study emphasizes how viruses can be introduced multiple times in - dependently into a given setting , especially when community transmission is high . We also suggest that mothers , and pos - sibly other primary caregivers , might be at higher risk of ac - quiring the transmission from children . More broadly , our findings can help guide case and contact management , future prevention and control measures , and epidemiological inves - tigations in childcare settings . Contributions to knowledge and practice What does this study add to existing knowledge ? & Multiple introductions whether simultaneous or succes - sive can happen and may be likely in a context of high community transmission . & Both symptomatic and asymptomatic children transmitted SARS - CoV - 2 to their parents and other children . & The infection can be transmitted rapidly from healthcare settings into childcare centres and schools . & An integrated investigative approach allowed the local , regional , and provincial health authorities to work togeth - er to achieve an effective and timely outbreak communi - cation among all parties . What are the key implications for public health interventions , practice or policy ? & The operational challenges encountered in the field of - fered an opportunity to adapt and innovate methods and tools , giving the experience a better perspective for inves - tigating future outbreaks . & These findings , together with available literature , suggest that schools and childcare centres should be closely mon - itored for cases and potential outbreaks . & This evidence should be considered when drafting new policies and official guidelines concerning SARS - CoV - 2 , so as not to minimize the role played by children in the transmission of the disease . & Sharing this experience can guide case and contact man - agement , future prevention and control measures , and ep - idemiological investigations in childcare settings .
