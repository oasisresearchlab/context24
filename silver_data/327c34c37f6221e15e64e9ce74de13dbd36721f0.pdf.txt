Although the crucial feature is the coexistence of phase - separated ﬂ uid domains , direct evidence for this in mixtures of cholesterol with a single lipid is extremely sparse .

Introduction Of the ca . 260 lipids constituting the yeast lipidome , ergosterol is the most abundant [ 1 ] . This is likely to be true also for cholesterol in higher organisms , where it is present in the plasma membranes at a roughly equimolar ratio with respect to total phospholipid . The function of cholesterol in membranes is partly as a ﬂ uidity regulator , condensing the chains of unsaturated lipids in ﬂ uid L α phases and ﬂ uidizing those of saturated lipids that would otherwise form solid - like L β gel phases [ 2 , 3 ] . The idea that cholesterol may play an additional functional role in membranes came with the theoretical suggestion , following earlier experiment - based proposals of partial binary phase diagrams [ 4 ] , that cholesterol could induce a separate phase – the liquid - ordered phase ( L o ) – that is distinct from the solid - ordered L β gel phase and the liquid - disordered L α ﬂ uid phase [ 5 ] . De ﬁ nitive experimental evidence for the existence of such a separate phase was provided ﬁ rst by two - component 2 H NMR spectra from the perdeuterated chains of gel - phase ( not ﬂ uid - phase ) lipids in the presence of cholesterol [ 6 , 7 ] . Possible implications of this novel phase in cell biology came from the proposal of lipid rafts as functional platforms involved both in the compartmentation of cellular membranes and in the directing of intracellular membrane traf ﬁ c [ 8 ] . The original raft concept was based on compositional differ - ences , in both lipids and proteins , that are found between the apical and basolateral membranes in polarized epithelial cells , and the speci ﬁ c targeting of membrane components that this implies . The apical membrane is characterized particularly by a high content of sphingolipids ( which have intrinsically high chain - melting temperatures [ 9 ] ) and of cholesterol . This is a lipid composition that favours formation of L o phases . On the other hand , the usual glycerolipids of the basolateral membrane bear unsaturated sn - 2 chains that favour formation of L α phases .

Thus , the biophysical correlate of membrane raft formation is the ﬂ uid – ﬂ uid phase separation between L α and L o lipid domains . Observation of lipid rafts in biological membranes has proved rather elusive , and consequently , direct detection of L α – L o phase separation in model membranes of de ﬁ ned composition is an important aspect of the raft concept . Although not entirely absent , direct evidence for ﬂ uid – ﬂ uid phase separation in binary mixtures of a single phospholipid and cholesterol is also extremely sparse . Historically , indirect evidence for ﬂ uid – ﬂ uid immiscibility in a phospholipid – cholesterol mixture was provided ﬁ rst by spin - labelled lipids [ 4 ] , which also led to the original suggestion that coexistence of immiscible phases in cell membranes would be of biological signi ﬁ cance and to the discovery of liquid – liquid immiscibility in phosphatidylcholine – cholesterol monolayers [ 11 ] that is now seen also in asymmetric bilayers [ 12 ] . Most direct evidence for L α – L o phase separation in bilayers comes currently , however , from ternary mixtures of cholesterol with two lipids that have , respectively , a low and a high chain - melting temperature . Ternary phase diagrams of such cholesterol - containing lipid mix - tures are , therefore , of central interest but are not without contro - versial aspects . Here , I collect together all the available phase diagrams of the above type . This encompasses those with sphingomyelin or a fully saturated phosphatidylcholine as the high - melting lipid and an unsaturated or short - chain phosphatidylcholine as the low - melting lipid . To increase accessibility to a wider readership , I give the experimental ternary phase diagrams in simple x – y coordinates , instead of the triangular , 60° - inclined coordinates that are used almost exclusively in the literature for presenting the original data . This compact x – y representation considerably simpli ﬁ es intercom - parison of the different data sets , making it possible to appreciate the common features and examine critically the discrepancies . First , I summarise the salient features of the triangular representation , before going on to explain the relationship with the simple x , y representa - tion . Then , I use the latter to present all the available ternary phase diagrams and hence to highlight what hard data currently support the membrane raft hypothesis . A reviewer of this paper remarked that every paper in this ﬁ eld should de ﬁ ne its use of the term “ raft . ” For the purpose of this review , the restricted position taken here is that without coexistence of L α and L o domains – of whatever size – lipid rafts do not exist . 2 . Ternary phase diagrams In the triangular representation , the compositions of ternary mixtures in mole fractions are given by the set of points contained within an equilateral triangle of unit side , as indicated in Fig . 1 . For any composition , P , the mole fractions ( X A , X B , X C ) of lipids A , B , and C ( cholesterol ) are given by the triangular coordinates of P along the directions CA , AB , and BC , respectively . From the geometry of an equilateral triangle , the sum of the three coordinates is equal to the length of a side , which ensures that : X A + X B + X C = 1 , as is required for mole fraction units . A straight line from the cholesterol vertex C of the triangle ( generically referred to as a “ diagonal ” ) represents compositions with a ﬁ xed mole ratio of the lipid components A and B , which is determined by the intercept ( X o ) on the opposite side ( AB ) . Thus , for any composition P on the line CX o , the mole ratio of lipid B to lipid A is X B / X A = X o / ( 1 − X o ) . Equivalent relations hold for “ diagonals ” from the two other vertices . More generally , if a system of composition α is mixed in any proportion with one of composition β , the total composition of the mixture P will lie on a straight line ( a tie line ) that joins α and β ( see a particular case in Fig . 1 ) . The fraction of α in the mixture is given by the lever rule : f = X B ; β − X B X B ; β − X B ; α ð 1 Þ where X B , α and X B , β are the mole fractions of B in the systems α and β , respectively . Equivalent expressions hold with the mole fractions of components A and C . Analogously , the total composition Q of a system in a three - phase region lies within the triangle αβγ that is bordered by intersecting tie lines for the constituent two - phase systems αβ , βγ , and αγ . 3 . Phospholipid – cholesterol ternary phase diagrams in x , y - coordinates The phase diagrams of hydrated lipid ternary mixtures with cholesterol are routinely presented in the literature as triangular x , y , z - coordinates in the so - called Gibbs triangle , as indicated above . Because cholesterol does not itself form bilayer membranes and can be incorporated into lipid bilayers at maximally a 2 : 1 mole ratio ( much less for certain unsaturated lipids [ 13 – 15 ] ) , there is no over - riding advantage to using 60° - inclined axes rather than the familiar orthogonal x , y - axes . Fig . 2 shows two representations of the ternary phase diagram for 1 - palmitoyl - 2 - oleoyl phosphatidylcholine ( POPC ) / N - palmitoyl sphingomyelin ( PSM ) / cholesterol mixtures from de Almeida et al . [ 16 ] . On the left , the x - axis is the mole fraction of PSM relative to total phospholipid , x = PSM / ( PSM + POPC ) , as in a binary phase diagram ; and the y - axis is the cholesterol to total phospholipid mole ratio , y = cholesterol / ( PSM + POPC ) , that is often used for discussing binary mixtures of lipids with cholesterol . From the conservation of mass , the mole ratio of cholesterol to phospho - lipid , y , in a region of coexisting phases α and β is given by : y = fy α + ð 1 − f Þ y β ð 2 Þ where f is the fraction of the α phase , and y α and y β are the mole ratios of cholesterol to phospholipid in phases α and β at the Fig . 1 . Triangularrepresentation ofthecompositionsofternarymixturesoflipidsAand B with cholesterol ( C ) . The axes to which mole fraction coordinates ( X A , X B , X C ) are referred are tilted at 60° to one another . α – β , β – γ and α – γ are tie lines and αβγ is a three - phase triangle . 2115 D . Marsh / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1788 ( 2009 ) 2114 – 2123 respective ends of the tie line . A similar relation holds for the mole fraction , x , of PSM in the phospholipid mixture : x = fx α + ð 1 − f Þ x β ð 3 Þ where x α and x β are the phospholipid mole fractions of PSM in phases α and β at the respective ends of the tie line . Thus the two are linearly related , and therefore , tie lines are straight , the three - phase triangle is preserved , and ﬁ xed cholesterol / PSM or POPC ratios lie on diagonals in this simple x – y representation and in a way more transparent than in the triangular representation ( cf . , Fig . 1 ) . For comparison , the triangular representation of the same phase diagram is given on the right of Fig . 2 , with compositions expressed as mole fractions relative to the total ternary mixture , e . g . , X ( cholester - ol ) = cholesterol / ( cholesterol + PSM + POPC ) . Relative to total mole fraction units , the cholesterol to phospholipid mole ratio is elongated at higher cholesterol contents . This effect is only excessive at compositions outside the region of interest . The advantages of using cholesterol / lipid mole ratio , instead of mole fraction , in the left - hand diagram are the linear dependences that were described above ( Eqs . ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) ) . As already mentioned , cholesterol mole ratio is frequently used in discussing cholesterol – phospholipid interactions and is also the quantity that determines cholesterol solubility in lipid bilayer membranes . Here , I shall present all published ternary phase diagrams in mixtures with cholesterol by using the simple x , y - coordinates . This also has the advantage of compactness , which eases comparison between the different data on the same system . 4 . Phosphatidylcholine / sphingomyelin / cholesterol mixtures Historically , Fig . 2 ( right ) from de Almeida et al . [ 16 ] was the ﬁ rst phase diagram to be published for a ternary lipid mixture with sphingomyelin and cholesterol . Because the high - melting lipid component is a sphingolipid and the low - melting lipid component is an sn - 2 unsaturated phosphatidylcholine , it corresponds most closely to a natural membrane lipid composition and has come to be considered as the canonical raft – lipid mixture . Phase coexistence was not detected directly in constructing the phase diagram in Fig . 2 ; instead , phase boundaries were detected from the spectroscopic properties of ﬂ uorescent lipid probes , trans - parinaric acid and diphenyl hexatriene . Figs . 3 to 5 collect together all further published ternary phase diagrams for mixtures of sphingomyelin ( SM ) and a low - melting phosphatidylcholine ( PC ) with cholesterol . Figs . 3 and 5 are based on Fig . 2 . Phase diagram for ternary mixtures of 1 - palmitoyl - 2 - oleoyl phosphatidylcholine ( POPC ) , N - palmitoyl sphingomyelin ( PSM ) and cholesterol at 23 °C .

Marsh / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1788 ( 2009 ) 2114 – 2123 observation of domains in giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs ) under the ﬂ uorescence microscope [ 17 ] . Fig . 4 is for porcine brain SM ( pBSM ) which contains predominantly C ( 18 : 0 ) ( 49 % ) and C ( 24 : 1 ) ( 20 % ) N - acyl chains , in contrast to C ( 16 : 0 ) for PSM . In this case , the region of ﬂ uid - phase ( L α – L o ) coexistence is mapped out by studying the kinetics of trapped dye release from large unilamellar vesicles ( LUVs ) , which is induced by the peptide δ - lysin , and the presence of gel phase is detected calorimetrically [ 18 ] . Gel – ﬂ uid coexistence causes ion leak arising from mismatch at the phase boundaries [ 19 ] , but the mismatch at ﬂ uid – ﬂ uid boundaries is less pronounced , more dif ﬁ cult to detect , and therefore requires enhancement by preferential targeting of membrane - active peptides . In fact , the original authors propose that the principal effect of L α – L o phase coexistence on dye release arises from concentration of δ - lysin in L α domains , because it is excluded from L o domains [ 18 ] . All phase diagrams for SM - containing systems ( Figs . 2 – 5 ) share the common features of a three - phase triangle ( L α + L o + L β ) and a region of ﬂ uid – ﬂ uid ( L α + L o ) coexistence , in addition to two regions of gel – ﬂ uid coexistence ( L α + L β and L o + L β ) that extend to the axes for the binary mixtures . It should be noted , however , that in none of the cases has the coexistence of three phases been demonstrated directly : the three - phase triangle is inferred indirectly on thermody - namic grounds . Although some differences between the various phase diagrams in Figs . 2 – 5 can be attributed to the different lipids used , pBSM vs . PSM and dioleoyl PC ( DOPC ) vs . POPC , there remain considerable differences in location of the various phase boundaries , especially for Figs . 2 ( left ) and 3 ( middle ) that refer to exactly the same lipids and temperature . These discrepancies must be attributed to the different experimental methods that are used to determine the phase boundaries , in addition to uncertainties in inference of the three - phase region . The most signi ﬁ cant qualitative difference between Figs . 2 and 3 is that the region of raft ( L α + L o ) coexistence extends out to the binary mixture POPC + cholesterol , which lies along the x = 0 axis in Fig . 2 . This is a controversial area . Currently , evidence for L α – L o coexistence in this binary mixture at 23 °C and above is indirect . It rests upon theoretically expected linear dependences for the ﬂ uorescence polarization of diphenyl hexatriene and the mean ﬂ uorescence lifetime of trans - parinaric acid on mole fraction of cholesterol in a two - phase region [ 16 ] and also on the ﬂ uorescence polarization and biphasic distribution of ﬂ uorescence lifetimes for trans - parinaric acid [ 20 ] . The absence of ﬂ uid – ﬂ uid coexistence for POPC + cholesterol in Fig . 3 could be because the domains are too small to be detected by light microscopy ( less than ∼ 300 nm ) . This is certainly the case for gel – ﬂ uid ( L β – L o ) coexistence in binary mixtures with cholesterol ( see open circles indicating uniform ﬂ uorescence along the entire x = 1 axis in Figs . 3 and 5 ) , where there is clear evidence for phase coexistence in PSM – cholesterol mixtures from two - component lipid spin - label EPR spectra [ 21 ] . Note that the boundaries of the L β – L o coexistence regions in Figs . 3 and 5 are simply inferred and not located from ﬂ uorescence microscopy . 2 H NMR spectroscopy yields two - component spectra in the gel regime of binary POPC – cholesterol mixtures , indicating L β – L o phase coexistence [ 7 ] . But it does not yield two - component spectra in the putative L α – L o coexistence region : only a broadening of the single - Fig . 4 .

Marsh / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1788 ( 2009 ) 2114 – 2123 component spectra , which might arise from exchange between small domains . However , 2 H NMR does reveal a horizontal phase boundary with the L β – L o coexistence region at ca . − 7 °C ( for sn - 1 chain - perdeuterated POPC ) , which implies L α – L o coexistence at tempera - tures immediately above this boundary [ 7 ] . Thus , the only real uncertainties for the POPC + cholesterol system are the size of the domains and the location of the miscibility transition temperature at which ﬂ uid – ﬂ uid phase separation disappears . Interestingly , there seems to be a consensus that ﬂ uid - phase immiscibility does not occur in mixtures of DOPC and cholesterol [ 22 – 25 ] ( cf . , Fig . 5 ) , although this binary system has been investigated neitherby 2 HNMRinthegeltemperatureregimenorby trans - parinaric acid and diphenyl hexatriene ﬂ uorescence in the ﬂ uid regime . In addition to the qualitative differences , there are also quantita - tive differences between Figs . 2 – 4 with regard to the positioning and extent of the crucial “ raft ” L α – L o coexistence region . Whereas it is a major insight of Fig . 4 to detect L α – L o ﬂ uid – ﬂ uid phase separation by means of peptide - enhanced ion permeability , the kinetics of leakage may not have the sensitivity to establish actual phase boundaries precisely . Perhaps the same might also be said about the detection of L α – L o phase coexistence from analysis of trans - parinaric acid ﬂ uorescence lifetimes . At ﬁ rst glance , direct visualization of coexisting lipid domains by ﬂ uorescence microscopy ( Figs . 3 and 5 ) provides the ideal answer . Unfortunately , it has been found that micron - sized domains can be produced by photochemically - induced processes under the in ﬂ uence of illumination [ 26 , 27 ] . Formation of light - induced domains is promoted by high concentrations of ﬂ uorescent probe , high levels of illumination , long duration of illumination , the presence of unsaturated lipids ( including SM ) , electrolytic processes accompanying the electroformation used in producing GUVs for microscopy , and crucially the presence of oxygen . The kinetics of light - induced domain formation depend on the lipid composition , viz . , on the cholesterol content [ 27 ] . Whereas the latter might suggest that detection of domains produced by illumination indicates the presence of pre - existing submicroscopic domains , it cannot be excluded on the other hand that “ instantaneous ” domains are light - induced with rapid kinetics . The closer to a phase boundary detected by ﬂ uorescence microscopy , the faster is the production of light - induced domains [ 27 ] . Under these circumstances , there is uncertainty associated with the exact position of the phase boundaries , if the in ﬂ uence of factors affecting formation of irradiation - induced domains is not investigated , particularly the exclusion of oxygen and addition of antioxidants . One solution to these potential uncertainties comes from 2 H NMR , which has been used to study ternary mixtures of phosphatidylcho - lines with cholesterol . 5 . Low - melting PC / high - melting PC / cholesterol Although fully saturated phospholipids occur only rarely in most biological membranes , those with higher chain - melting temperatures can act as a surrogate for the sphingolipid component in ternary mixtures representing model lipid rafts . Results on mixtures of a high - melting PC with a low - melting PC and cholesterol are more numerous than for the SM counterpart . The ternary phase diagrams of these systems are presented in Figs . 6 to 10 . In these ﬁ gures and what Fig . 6 .

Marsh / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1788 ( 2009 ) 2114 – 2123 follows , L β is used generically to designate PC gel phases . Details of gel - phase coexistences involving the P β ′ and L β ′ phases are not taken into account . It should be noted that both the chain tilt in the L β ′ phase and the pretransition between L β ′ and P β ′ phases of saturated PCs are eliminated at relatively low cholesterol contents [ 28 ] . Dipalmitoyl PC ( DPPC ) replaces SM as the high - melting lipid in Fig . 6 and DOPC is the low - melting partner . This phase diagram is determined solely from 2 H NMR by using DPPC with perdeuterated chains and is notable for the considerable numbers of tie lines , which are located by identifying spectra that contain the same two components differing only in their relative proportions [ 29 ] . The slopes of these tie lines , which largely determine the orientation of the three - phase region , can be expressed intuitively in the x , y represen - tation and are listed in Table A . 1 of the Appendix . That well resolved two - component 2 H NMR spectra are observed in the raft coexistence region containing L α and L o domains in this three - component system is noteworthy . It implies that the domains are too large for spectral averaging to occur by translational diffusion of lipids between these different ﬂ uid domains . The two - dimensional equivalent of the Einstein equation for Brownian diffusion gives the mean - square distance traveled in time t ′ as : h r 2 i = 4 D T t V ð 4 Þ where D T is the translational diffusion coef ﬁ cient . Typical lipid lateral diffusion coef ﬁ cients are D T ∼ 10 μ m 2 s − 1 in L α phases and a factor of two lower in L o phases [ 22 , 30 ] . That the smallest quadrupole splittings ( those of the chain terminal methyls , for which the difference is : δΔ ω Q ∼ 6×10 3 rad s − 1 ) not be averaged by translational diffusion requires domain diameters considerably in excess of 0 . 1 – 0 . 2 μ m ( see , e . g . , [ 31 ] ) . The coexisting L α and L o domains that are visualized by ﬂ uorescence microscopy are much larger than this lower limit [ 32 , 33 ] , although estimates of domain sizes from ﬂ uorescence energy transfer for POPC / SM / cholesterol mixtures include some values within this range [ 34 , 35 ] . For EPR of spin - labelled lipids , by comparison , the smallest differences in splittings between L o - and L α - phase spectra ( for the 14 - or 16 - positions of the chains ) are approximately 10 4 times greater than in 2 H NMR [ 21 ] and therefore require domain diameters 100 times smaller , i . e . , these should be considerably greater than ∼ 1 − 2 nm to avoid averaging by translational diffusion . This suggests that , in addition to detecting domain coexistence , two - component EPR spectra might also detect transient cluster formation arising from critical ﬂ uctuations , but only if these are slower than the characteristic 10 − 100 MHz frequency range of the spin - label EPR splittings . Current 2 H NMR analysis of critical ﬂ uctuations concentrates on frequencies in the range of 0 . 1 − 10 MHz [ 29 , 36 ] . For phase coexistence , on the other hand , the individual components of two - component spectra should be identical to the single - component spectra from the immediately adjacent single phases . Broadening may occur from exchange between domains , if these are suf ﬁ ciently small , or alternatively from ﬂ uctuations if the system is close to a critical point . In general , phase coexistence and formation of clusters from critical behaviour can only be distinguished by a critical evaluation of the entire phase diagram and its dependence on temperature .

Marsh / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1788 ( 2009 ) 2114 – 2123 miscibility critical temperatures is included in the Appendix ( Table A . 4 ) . As already noted for POPC + cholesterol , the situation is different for L α – L o coexistence in binary mixtures , including DPPC + cholesterol [ 6 ] , 1 - palmitoyl - 2 - petroselinoyl PC + cholesterol [ 7 ] and 1 - stearoyl - 2 - elaidoyl PC ( SEPC ) + cholesterol [ 37 ] . Two - component 2 H NMR spectra were not observed in the putative L α + L o regime for any of these binary systems ( but see [ 38 ] ) , although two - component spectra thatcorrespondtoL β – L o phasecoexistenceinthegel - phaseregimeare seen clearly . Indeed , as stated in the Introduction , 2 H NMR spectros - copy of DPPC + cholesterol binary mixtures provided the ﬁ rst , and unambiguous , experimental identi ﬁ cation of the liquid - ordered phase in lipid bilayer membranes , but only in coexistence with the gel phase [ 6 ] . For two - component 2 H NMR spectra not to be detected in the L α + L o region , the largest quadrupole splittings ( those of the order - parameter plateau region for which : δΔ ω Q ∼ 7×10 4 rad s − 1 ) must be averaged by translational diffusion . This requires diameters of considerably less than 30 – 50 nm for the phase - separated domains , which is consistent with them not being visualized by ﬂ uorescence microscopy ( cf . , [ 32 , 33 ] ) . A notable feature of the phase diagrams in Fig . 6 is that the three - phase regions are identi ﬁ ed from composite 2 H NMR spectra , which consist of the same three components in different proportions . This is the ﬁ rst case in which coexistence of three phases has been demonstrated directly for several compositions . Three coexisting phases had been visualized shortly before by ﬂ uorescence lifetime imaging of a GUV with overall composition DOPC / DPPC 1 : 1 mol / mol + 12 mol % cholesterol at 24 °C [ 23 ] . This point ( x = 0 . 5 , y = 0 . 136 ) is located within the three - phase triangles at 20 and 25 °C for the equivalent ternary mixture with d 62 - DPPC in Fig . 6 ( and in the phase diagram for 22 °C in Fig . 7 ) . Fig . 7 presents phase diagrams also for the DOPC / DPPC / choles - terol system , also determined from 2 H NMR spectroscopy . Although there are overall similarities to Fig . 6 in the location of the L α – L o coexistence region and orientation of the tie lines at comparable temperatures , there are appreciable differences , and even greater differences in the L o – L β coexistence region and in the three - phase triangle . The L o + L β phase boundaries in Fig . 7 are determined at x = 1 by the data of Vist and Davis [ 6 ] for DPPC + cholesterol binary mixtures , whereas those in Fig . 6 are based on the tie line established for x = 1 at 10 °C ( upper panel ) . Although three - component spectra were identi ﬁ ed , this was insuf ﬁ cient to position the boundaries of the three - phase region in Fig . 7 [ 38 ] . The border of the three - phase triangle with the L α + L o region was located from the extent of this two - phase region , but the vertex involving coexistence with the L β gel phase could not be determined accurately . DPPC is again the high - melting lipid in Fig . 8 , but the low - melting lipid is diphytanoyl PC . Phytanic acid has an extensively methyl - branchedchain ( 3 , 7 , 11 , 15 - Me 4 - 16 : 0 ) , theether - linkedversionofwhich in archaeal membrane lipids is a chemically more stable alternative to the cis - unsaturated chains found in bacteria and higher organisms . This ternary , cholesterol - containing system gives rise to a particularly large range of L α + L o domain coexistence , as detected by ﬂ uorescence microscopy . Fluid – ﬂ uid phase separation is observed by two - compo - nent 2 H NMR spectra from DPPC with perdeuterated chains , and estimated end points for tie lines through the composition DPhyPC / DPPC 1 : 1 + 30 mol % cholesterol ( x = 0 . 5 , y = 0 . 43 ) lie reasonably close Fig . 9 .

Temperatures : 23 °C , 25 °C , and 24 °C for top , middle , and bottom , respectively . Data from top : Zhao et al . [ 45 ] , middle : Silvius et al . [ 43 ] , and bottom : Feigenson and Buboltz [ 46 ] and Chiang et al . [ 44 ] . Fig . 10 . Ternary mixtures of ( top to bottom ) : POPC – cholesterol – DPPC , POPC – cholesterol – DSPC , 1 - stearoyl - 2 - oleoyl phosphatidylcholine ( SOPC ) – cholesterol – DSPC , and DLPC – cholesterol – DSPC , at 23 °C . Solid circles represent two coexisting phases , open circles represent vesicles showing uniform ﬂ uorescence , and solid squares are phase boundaries . Data from Zhao et al . [ 27 ] . 2120 D . Marsh / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1788 ( 2009 ) 2114 – 2123 ( but are not identical ) to the phase boundaries constructed from ﬂ uorescence microscopy ( see Fig . 8 ) . The observation of immiscibilityat temperatures above that for chain - melting of DPPC has led to the proposal of a phase diagram with two miscibility critical points ( see 43°CinFig . 8 ) . Withthedirectionofthetielinesdeterminedby 2 HNMR , this would virtually exclude L α + L o phase separation for binary mixtures of DPPC + cholesterol , because the tie line would end at the boundary of a two - phase region [ 39 ] . Although most of the evidence for L α + L o phase coexistence in the binary system DPPC + cholesterol was indirect at the time , this was still a controversial suggestion because the upper boundary of L β + L o coexistence region is practically horizontal in the binary phase diagram [ 6 , 40 ] . More recently , two - component 2 H NMR spectra have been observed for DPPC + 25 mol % cholesterol at temperatures immediately above that for chain - melting of DPPC with perdeuterated chains [ 38 ] . Even prior to this , L α + L o phase coexistence had been demonstrated for binary mixtures of PSM and cholesterol at a temperature well above the chain - melting transition of PSM , from two - component EPR spectra of spin - labelled phospholipids [ 21 ] . Therefore , present evidence indicates L α + L o phase coexistence in DPPC + cholesterol binary mixtures , at least at temperatures immediately above the horizontal phase boundary , but this is not detected by ﬂ uo - rescence microscopy presumably because the domains are too small . Fig . 9 ( top and bottom panels ) compares two phase diagrams , for DOPC / distearoyl PC ( DSPC ) / cholesterol and dilauroyl PC ( DLPC ) / DPPC / cholesterol , bothfromthesamelaboratoryandbothdeducedby using ﬂ uorescence microscopy of GUVs . That with the greater difference in chain - melting temperature between the PC components ( viz . , DOPC and DSPC ) corresponds to the general pattern presented in Figs . 2 to 8 . In contrast , raft - like ﬂ uid – ﬂ uid phase coexistence is not observed for the DLPC / DPPC / cholesterol system , only phase separa - tion between gel and ﬂ uid phases . The latter is also the case for a series of PC – cholesterol ternary mixtures in which the difference in chain - melting temperature is less than that for DOPC and DSPC ( see Fig . 10 ) . For POPC / DPPC / cholesterol , POPC / DSPC / cholesterol , stearoyl - oleoyl PC ( SOPC ) / DSPC / cholesterol and DLPC / DSPC / cholesterol , the only domain formation detected is that corresponding to L α + L β phase separation , although these are systems for which light - induced domains are produced outside the L α + L β region [ 27 ] . This distinctly different pattern of observation in the ﬂ uorescence microscope was originally taken to indicate two quite different types of miscibility behaviour [ 41 ] , but more recently , this view has been moderated [ 42 ] . The non - observation of L α + L o phase coexistence is now attributed to the small size of the domains . This interpretation is not surprising in view of the fact that L β + L o phase coexistence cannot be visualized in DPPC – cholesterol binary mixtures by ﬂ uorescence microscopy [ 32 ] , despite de ﬁ nitive evidence that it exists from 2 H NMR [ 6 ] . As is seen here , thisregionofgel – ﬂ uidphaseseparationisconspicuouslymissing from the phase diagrams shown in Fig . 10 and in the bottom panel of Fig . 9 . Evidence for ﬂ uid – ﬂ uid phase separation in at least one of these systems comes from spectroscopy . The middle panel in Fig . 9 depicts the boundary of L α + L o phase coexistence for DLPC / DPPC / cholesterol thatisdeterminedfrom ﬂ uorescencequenchingbyaterminalbromine atom on the sn - 2 chain of DLPC [ 43 ] . From this prescient early work , a phase diagram with extensive L α – L o coexistence is predicted that contains additionally all the features determined later by ﬂ uorescence microscopy , 2 H NMR and other techniques ( cf . , Figs 3 – 8 ) . 6 . Conclusions Direct evidence for ﬂ uid – ﬂ uid phase separation of the L α + L o type in ternary phase diagrams of cholesterol - containing mixtures is less extensive than might generally be assumed . It would require an over - enthusiastic application of Occam ' s razor to discount all domains visualized by ﬂ uorescence microscopy as being light - induced , but if this were done , there remain only the phase diagrams supported by 2 H NMR for the two systems , DOPC / DPPC / cholesterol and DPhyPC / DPPC / cholesterol , that are given in Figs . 6 – 8 . To these can be added three further ternary phase diagrams for POPC / PSM / cholesterol ( Fig . 3 ) , DOPC / PSM / cholesterol ( Fig . 5 ) , and DOPC / DSPC / cholesterol ( Fig . 9 ) , where coexisting L α + L o domains are visualized by ﬂ uorescence microscopy . Putting aside statistical issues with GUVs , the great advantage of ﬂ uorescence microscopy is the demonstration of domains coexisting within the same membrane . Bulk measurements do not distinguish this from an inhomogeneous population of membranes . Potentially , inhomogeneities could arise from differential lipid solubilities in the organic solvent that is used to prepare the mixtures . Freeze – drying from a volatile organic solvent ( and / or freeze – thaw ) is not invariably applied , but for PC – cholesterol or SM – cholesterol mixtures , this is unlikely to be a serious issue at cholesterol contents well below the solubility limit ( see , e . g . , [ 18 ] ) . The major shortcoming with conventional optical microscopy is that only large domains can be detected . This not only leads to non - detection of phase separation in regions where this is well established by other techniques but also adds to the potential uncertainties in location of phase boundaries that arise from the possibility of light - induced domain formation . 2 H NMR cannot detect small domains in regions of ﬂ uid – ﬂ uid phase separation because averaging takes place by rapid translational exchange . This is not a limitation for gel – ﬂ uid phase separation because translational diffusion in the gel phase is very slow . The detection of three - phase coexistence by 2 H NMR is an important advance not simply because it con ﬁ rms thermodynamic expectations for ternary mixtures : it also implies the existence of a three - phase triangle with separate regions of two - phase coexistence bordering its three sides . Location of the three - phase triangle remains , however , one of the greater areas of uncertainty in the published phase diagrams ( compare Figs . 5 and 6 ) . The sides of the three - phase triangle must be almost parallel to the closest tie lines in the adjacent two - phase regions ( see Appendix ) . In the L α + L o regions of DOPC / DPPC / cholesterol mixtures , these have a slopeof ∼ 0 . 6inFig . 6 and ∼ 0 . 9inFig . 7 ( seeTableA . 1intheAppendix ) , i . e . , are parallel to lines corresponding to mixtures with cholesterol / DPPCratiosof 0 . 6 and0 . 9 , respectively . Theslopes of thetie lines inthe L α + L o regions of DPhyPC / DPPC / cholesterol mixtures are in the higher range with values of 0 . 8 – 1 . 4 ( see Fig . 8 and Table A . 3 ) . A similar orientation , close to that of mixtures with a cholesterol / DPPC ratio of 1 : 1 , hasalsobeenproposedintheSM - containingsystemsofFigs . 2and 4 [ 16 , 18 ] . For the L α + L β two - phase region , one detailed experimental study [ 44 ] gives tie lines with a very small slope , i . e . , almost parallel to the x - axis , in DLPC / DPPC / cholesterol mixtures ( see Table A . 4 and bottom panel of Fig . 9 ) . Small , but somewhat larger slopes ∼ 0 . 2 are found for L α – L β tie lines in the DOPC / DPPC / cholesterol system ( see Table A . 1 ) . Tie lines are not yet available in the L o + L β region of phase coexistence , and this is a principal source of uncertainty . The most conservative approach at the moment is to place them approximately parallel to the y - axis , corresponding to the tie line for the binary mixture with cholesterol , i . e . , x = 1 ( see , e . g . , [ 16 ] ) . In spite of the uncertainties and disagreements , 2 H NMR ( if nothing else ) demonstrates that ﬂ uid – ﬂ uid phase separation , with large domains induced by cholesterol , is possible in membranes of ternary lipid mixtures . Many uncertainties still exist at the cholester - ol - containing edges of the phase diagrams summarised here ( and even in the middle in Fig . 10 ) and may be associated with the small size of the domains in these regions . In this connection , it is worth re - emphasizing the ﬁ nding of L α + L o phase coexistence in the binary systems DPPC + cholesterol and PSM + cholesterol , and also that the horizontal phase boundary found in the binary phase diagrams of several lipids ( POPC , SEPC , 1 - palmitoyl - 2 - petroselinoylPC , and dimyristoylPC ) with cholesterol implies L α + L o phase coexistence at temperatures immediately above this three - phase line . In particular , two - component spectra establish L α – L o phase coexistence in the binary mixtures DPPC + cholesterol and PSM + cholesterol [ 38 , 21 ] , 2121 D .
